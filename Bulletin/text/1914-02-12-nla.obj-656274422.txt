The Red Page
The Rymbel
When the rymbel was introduced to Aus-
tralasia she was an awkward and stuttering
idiot: this page crudely attempted to teach
her manners, and then left her to the tender
mercies of the bards. Each had his own idea
or the education she required; and back she
comes to tnis page decked out with improve-
ments and clad in fanciful costume. But
some of the garments into which she has
Deen put are grotesque, and some of her
company manners are hardly nice. So, from
the errors in ta-ste discernible in her educa-
tion, this page has formulated its own rules
qt conduct and dress, and by these rules the
An-trahan rymbel will be judged.
at- i irS J?’ t * le l 3Un hiust be a complete one;
lviick Sweeney ends one stanza with compos-
ing, and begins the next with compos mentis.
Next, it seems an error in taste not to keep
to the same length of pun. Thus, if you
u Bll \ a one-syllable keyword, you
should keep to the one-syllable miscue all
thiough. And if you prefer a three-syllable
pun you should not relax into puns of lesser
length. Thus Roy R. 11-ede begins with
na Allows, cleverly, with idolatry—
1, Doll, a tree, and horizon with Ho! rise
on; and T. V. Tierney, beginning with
nanayr hand, progresses to circumvent — -Sir,
come vent. But these are counsels of per-
fection, and in the final judgment they have
had to go by the board. Incidentally, it
may be mentioned that the best metre for
the rymbel is the trochaic—a fact discovered
a minority of the competitors. The
chief fault of the entries, however, was the
frequent excessively wide jump in thought
between the end of one stanza and the begin-
ning of the next, suggesting the idea that
i? e JP un keen dragged in at the expense
of the orderly progression of the rymbeller’s
intent. A good sample of this faking is to be
found in A. E. B. Wood’s rymbel:—
Miss Olga, fair of face and slim,
Is Puritanic purely,
But Yunga, plain I must confess,
Has not her sister’s narrowness,
Nor does site smile demurely.
De Muir Leigh is their pater. He
(Through Olga’s intervention)
Most luckily perchanced to see
Our greeting osculatory,
And asked me my intention.
(In “ ’tention” there’s a warning sound
To anyone who’s martial.)
I deemed it meet to be discreet,
And told him to his daughter sweet
Miss Yur.ga I was partial.
“Pa shall not sanction it,” exclaimed
A voice I knew, maternal,
“I have in view a Christian true,
And will not let her marry you.
Your cheek is most infernal.”
“In fern a lady could be dressed.
’Tis cheap, and maybe healthy.
But as for me,” sneered Olga Leigh,
“I much prefer costumery.”
(In satire she is wealthy.)
“Well, Theo, Yunga’s yours,” said Pa,
“So hustle. Find a domice.
She’ll get a wee annuity
If from this awful wowsery
You’ll save her.” Did I promise t
And John Patrick spoils a natty rymbel
by suddenly introducing George I. Moffit in
response to the damsel’s remark, “ George,
I’m off it!"
Obviously, however, there must be some
slight titillation of the reader’s attention by
the keyword of each stanza : the problem of
rymbelling is so to adjust the continuity of
the narrative with the cleverness of the pun
that the reader’s mind is first brought up
short and then finds its suspense neatly re-
solved without a break in the meaning. In
miniature, it is the old principle of dramatic
suspense; you wonder, worry, and, then,
looking back, suddenly see.
Another fault of immature rymbellers is
their lack of climax. The thing should end
with a snap: the last word should not be
too clearly foreseen : it should be used in a
different, and unexpected connotation to that
anticipated. The perfect rymbel begins quite
unobtrusively, and ends with an unsuspected
emphasis upon the modest keyword or
words. The perfect rymbel has not yet been
written. Many excellent rymbles, among
them entries from Syd. C., Rudolph Aug-
stein, “Last Hope” (a particularly neat, but
too slight, effort), and Leslie Lee, fail in
cleverness by employing easy, single-syllable
puns. The last entrant, too, drops from
poetry to prose in his weak ending, as does
Duncan Browne, in a quotable rymbel of
serious intent;—•
SUNRISE—AN OTWAY MORNING.
Prone, without form, beneath the pregnant night,
The earth like some great huddled sleeper lies
Outstretched towards the trembling edge of light,
Where newborn day has peeped with blue-grey
eyes
To see the twinkling heavens on him fawn.
Faun and satyr in this place must be
Lurking amid the bushland’s deeper shade,
While loud-voiced Triton from the restless sea
Makes more profound the silence of the glade,
As winds his awful roaring to it bear.
Bare trees against the sun’s light first throw out
Their fire-scorched limbs as if to hold the night’s
Dark tresses to their nakedness; about
Our feet the virgin younger growth delights
The eye and hides full many a time-scarred butt.
But, with a choir of magpie minstrelsy
That pours in liquid n*tes the bushland’s charm,
The laggard sun low down against the sea
Bestains the earth with gold—in quick alarm
Are fled the faun and satyr from the scene.
Seen through the mist the Bay of Islands gleams
In curves of glistening white about the base
Of age-old cliffs ; and ever upward streams
The long diapasons of waves that chase
Each other through each rocky eddying strait.
Straight from the tents across the dew-hushed sod
To where night’s shadows in a pool lie hid,
Go men with drowsy greetings; and a nod
From one hight “Boss” warns me I must be rid
Of dreams to which all idle men are prone.
It will be seen that the rymbel can be
serious when she chooses. Here are two
of high merit:—
A RYMBEL OF FAIRYLAND.
•' Caro will not come, my little one,
Within this dim, enchanted glade;
Care does not mar the fairies’ fun,
Who dance their dance from sun to sun
In moonlight robes arrayed.
Rayed from, the centre fairy-man,
See how light they trip and twirl!
How ■ like some filmy, fluttering fan,
They flash and fade, now bright, now wan—*
Each foot a twinkling pearl.
Purling along, the brook a-near
Keeps time for their dance in minor key,
As it flows to its rest in the silent mere;
List to the fairy music, dear;
Sit here and watch with me.
Methinks they see thee, little one—
They know thy shining eyes and hair; .
They call thee now to join their fun,
And dance with them from sun to sun,
In this Land of Never-Oare.
L. SPARROW.
Rime not, for pity’s sake, for hereabout,
One distant day, the voice of Poesy
A dulcet incantation sang to me;
And song’s great spirit came dull care to rout,
And brought the promise of a guinea fee.
Feed not on promises thy Muse may bring;
It brought me this, my fancy’s painted doll,
The Rymbel, or a punster’s fun’ral knoll.
I felt like, as I cursed the endless thing,
A mariner marooned on some atoll.
A tolerant and peaceful attitude
The thing maintained throughout my hot tirade
Until I tried with my slow brain to trade,
And whisky brought; then it became quite rude;
And there against my lack of nous inveighed.
Invaded by the thing’s invective vile,
Around, about me reeled this den of mine,
Each book danced as a dancing columbine;
Then, as its frenzy passed, with quiet guile
It sought to me this mission to assign :
“As, signed by thee, a duplicate of me
Roams o’er the earth,” it said, “Where song is not,
All other poems brand as rhythmic rot,
Till I alone rule song’s Posterity;
This task, O dreamer, thee I now allot.”
A lot of Rymbels on. the shelf now lie;
Those harlequins of sweet song’s pantomime
Rejected were by editors each time
I sent them in. Sometimes I think they sigh
And see Parnassus ’neath the ages’ rime.
L. A. ROYLETT.
But the rymbel is happiest when she is
most irresponsible. Some excellent samples,
worth space—and space-rates :
STRIKE!
Strike me pink! But this is rather rough.
I really feel that I should make a row
About this rattly, rambling, Rymbel rot.
If it’s the latest fad, it’s rather hot—
It is, in fact, a perfect, blanky cow.
Cowards, of course, would take it lying down;
But I’m a poet, so I swears and storms,
And hereby hurls a crimson curse or two,
Because they’ve gone and started something new,
Just when I thought I’d mastered all the forms.
Forms may be mostly made to sit upon;
But I’ve a feeling that I’d rather like
To come down on this latest wilh a flop.
I think I’ll shut up my poetic shop,
And, as a poet, go right out on strike!
MOANA.
BULLETINITIS.
Sally waits for me I know,
The right I’ll not dispute her.
I want to read the new Red Page,
I cannot help my Sally’s rage,
Such treatment ne’er will suit her.
Souter’s dainty semi-nudes.
Each week they grow the sweeter.
Eardley Turner’s subtle wit,
“Kodak’s” sporty little bit,
And Hervey’s fervid metre.
Meet her now I know I should,
Waits she at the G.P.O.
The “Snake” has me within his toils,
At “Bellerive’s” tale my., mind recoils,
Oh, that blood-stained stiletto!
Still let, oh, let me tarry,
And with “Vandorian” dally.
’Tis joy enough for me to read,
To muse upon her witty screed,
And con each brilliant sally.
L. W.N.
I am sending on a rymbel, it’s a rymbel. writ at
random,
And I thought the same was worthless till I read it
to my mate,
Then Bill the bullock-driver
Said it’s worth a blanky fiver,
Being a South Australian rymbel manufactured in
the State.
Statements often differ, so I’m doubting Bill’s
opinion.
He’s a good enough Australian, but his intellect is
weak,
So it goes for your inspection,
Your approval or rejection
You’ll decide if it’s a rymbel or a literary freak.
Frequently I’ve noticed, in your correspondence
columns,
Some awful verses written for the Sydney Bulletin,
And it won’t be unexpected,
If this rymbel is rejected,
And you tell me that my effort was a literary sin.
Sincerely I might mention, in conclusion, I’m a
smithy,
And hammer glowing iron for a living—by the bye
My muse was going splendid,
Till my rhyming mood was ended,
By a glowing cinder landing in the comer of my
eye.
BELTANA.
NYMPHS IN PASSING.
Rosie, you’re a little thorn,
That to me has rife sent;
’Tis my heart that you have torn,
’Tis my love you make forlorn
With your charm translucent.
Loo sent love beams with her eyes—
Yours past hers are rated ;
Why are yours twin mysteries,
Well’d in depth that chill implies?
Be love-animated.
Annie mated long ago,—■
Fat for her was fated;
Now she queens it in a show,
And she Still does fatter grow—•
To flesh dedicated.
Dead-eye Kate hid from the trade,
Bars no more may hold her;
Oft, full, oft that defty maid
-Pull’d me foam that winked and played
At the tales I’ve told her.
Toll’d her bell! Rose ne’er pulls,
Beer that makes me prosy ;
, Rosie's charm nor Time annuls.
She can ne’er be with the culis—
Time with her is rosy !
L. T. V.
Tlie last rymbel is delightful, but the puns
are a little forced.
S
The guinea is divided between Nella
Campbell, 6t> Corlette-street, Newcastle,
N.S.Avh, and Ethel Pawfiey, “Ocean View,”
Ocean Beach, Manly, both rymbels making
exceptions in the suggested rule of keeping
the puns to the same number of syllables,
but both compensating for this defect by the
cleverness with which the continuity in de-
velopment is kept by the rambling rebellious
pun-linlcs, and the cleverness with which the
innocent links are disguised. ' In the
present state of development of the
hardly-acclimatised rymbel these two com-
petitors score simply by their treat-
ment of the subject matter. Again,
the technically correct examples sent in are
in themselves not sufficiently interesting to
win the prize. Finally, the perfect rymbel
is not yet written. A further opportunity
may yet be given by means of another com-
petition.
RYMBEL.
BY NELLA CAMPBELL.
A handy cap adorned her head —
Her head was very fair —
And Oh! She was demurely meek!
But when I kissed her blushing cheek,
She begged me to forbear.
“For. hear in mind,”" she coyly said,
“If George comes out, of course
There'll be a fearful row, for he,
In matters oscillatory,
Your conduct can’t indorse!’’
Indoors she went, and left me there,
Abashed at this mishap.
I deemed her single, fancy-free—
Of course her husband’s sure to be —
The brute! —a handicap.
RYMBEL.
BY ETHEL PAWLEY.
The poets write that silver streams
Go down to kiss the sea.
That fairy ships a-load ivith dreams —
With elfin spoil each shallop teems —
With Ocean haste to he.
Two beastly, sluggish creeks I know;
/ But ne'er a silver rill.
Those very creeks a hard would show
To he brave streams that swiftly flow
With waters clear a-fill.
A Philistine I e’en must he,
With dull and holder eyes,
Which in a creek no magic see
While hards in words of ecstasy
Do it immortalise.
Immortal eyes do hards possess
That they see visions bright?
To never see the streams grow less,
Nor forest lose her vernal dress,
Are these the poet’s right?
Fiction
“There are still spacious compounds on
this planet where perfectly natural sexual
relations are permitted to be mentioned with-
out unnatural blushes” ; and apparently Bur-
mah is one of them. For The Repentance of
Destiny, a romance of Anglo-Burman life, by
Shway Dinga (Duckworth, per George Rob-
ertson), is astonishingly frank in these mat-
ters. The author of Wholly Without Morals
evidently knows the Burman and his British
ruler at first hand ; but this story of the con-
tact of East and West suffers because the
author takes for granted the reader’s know-
ledge of Burmah under British rule. It is a
brutal story of the apparently usual concu-
binage practised by the bright young men
who come from Oxford to rule Burmah; and
the Burmese “marriage” of a beautiful young
Burman woman with a British official is des-
cribed with much interesting detail. But
this Englishman possesses a sort of con-
science, and desires to give up his “wife” in
the interests of his career and of the Impe-
rialism he professes. The consequence is
tragedy, in which is involved a Burmese
whose ambition draws him from a monas-
tery to enter the Government service. This
admirably-drawn character affords us a valu-
able insight into the mind of the Burman.
Bocal color, however, is splashed o* so
thickly that the story behind it becomes occa-
sionally indistinct. The impression, how-
ever, emerges that, if not now, at least re-
cently, the behavior of the ruling race in
Burmah does not make for the respect of the
conquered Burman. “The key to our Impe-
perial greatness,” the hero says, “seems to lie
in the fact that we keep a conquered race at
arm’s length.... But I cannot and will not
believe that our Imperial greatness lies in
cutting the Burman by day, "whilst it’s per-
missible to consort with his daughter by
night.” As always, a conqueror becomes the
slave of the race he has conquered.
£
James Stephens had better be careful.
The author of The Charwoman's Daughter
and of The Crock of Gold is one of our few
humorists; and in Here are Ladies . (Mac-
millan) he is beginning to cheapen and dilute
his fantastic wit. Yet Stephens is still
Irish, and. apparently intends to remain so.
In his latest book, a collection of short
stories and sketches, there is invention, fan-
tasy and line humor—in streaks, but the
streakiuess is compensated for by the pre-
sence of anew element —his brilliant powers
of observation. His “Three Heavy Hus-
bands,” his “Three Women who Wept,” and
his “Three Young Wives” are delightful
studies in modern realism lit by freakish
fantasy. The wife of one of the heavy hus-
bands was resentful, for though “sometimes
he petted her, and always he was polite, he
had not told her that her eyes were the jnost
wonderful and inspiring orbs into which a
tired man could look. He never said that
there would not be much to choose between
good and evil if lie lost her. He never said
that one touch of her lips would electrify a
paralytic into an acrobat. He never swore
that he would commit suicide and dive to
deep perdition if she threw him over—none
of these things. It is possible that she did
not wish him to say or do such extrava-
gances, but he had not played the game, and,
knowing that something was badly wrong,
she nursed a grievance, that horrid foster-
ling.” And one feels a certain sympathy
with the heavy husbahd who was confronted
with the problem: "After one has married a
lady, what does one say to her?” And one
is left pleasantly wondering at the dilemma
of. the third heavy husband, who refused any
longer to wait up' for his irresponsible wife—
she had gone out at night alone against his
express commands.
“In his bedroom he did not trouble to get
a light. He undressed in a bitterly savage
mood; and rolled into bed, only to jumn out
again in sudden terror, for there was some-
one in it. It was his wife. He lay down
with a hazy, half-mad mind. Had he
wronged her? Was she more amenable than
he had fancied? She had not gone out at
all—or, had she gone out, sneaked in again
by the back door and crept noiselessly to
b‘>d? He fell asleep on the tattered fringe
of a debate—Had he wronged her? or had she
diddled him again?”
For James Stephens in his new mood, let
us consider this passage from “A Glass of
Beer” : “There were faces also to be looked
at; round, chubby faces wherefrom the eyes
of oxen stared in slow, involved rumination.
Long faces that were keener than hatchets
and as cruel. Faces that pretended to be
scornful, and were only piteous. .. .Raddled
faces with heavy eyes and rouged lips.
Ragged lips that had been chewed by every
mad dog in the world. What lips there were
everywhere! Bright scarlet splashes in
dead-white face?. Thin red gashes that
suggested rat-traps instead of kisses. Bul-
bous. flabby lips that would wobble and
shiver if attention failed them. Lips of a
horrid fascination that one looked at and
hated and ran tq.”
His garrulous old man who discourses on
all things in “There is a ■ Tavern in the
Town” shows us Stephens pumping up his
humor with difficulty. His old man is fool-
ish. forced and dull. But everything can be
forgiven the author for his tremendous story
of the adventures of a threepenny-bit in
Hell. Brien O’Brien, into whose dead hand
the cash had been placed, dropped that three-
penny-bit on his way to Hell, and there
discovered his loss. Despite the
and ingenious efforts of the Chief Tormen-
tor, O’Brien kept shouting his complaint:
“I have been robbed in Heaven !” All Hell
took up his demand for justice, and business
was suspended. The trouble extended to
Heaven, and Rhadamanthus was compelled
to sit up and take notice. As it happened, a
young seraph had found the money, and re-
fused to give it up on the ground that find-
ings were keepings. The perplexed Rhada-
mon thus flung the seraph into space, and
O’Brien after him, and ultimately they both
fell to earth, where apparently their adven-
tures are only about to begin. This story is
a masterpiece in fantastic invention.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

School Teachers Who Suffer from
Insomnia and Nervous Breakdown.
The following is a testimony to the nerve-restoring powers of
Clements Tonic. One of the most brain-racking of duties is that of
public-school teaching—correctly training “the young idea how to
shoot,” making pupils perfect by examination time —these great de-
partmental worries make nervous breakdown and insomnia common
ailments amongst the rank and file of public-school teachers. This
letter is from a lady who has been a brilliant example of her profes-
sion, having held the following high appointments in the Educational
Department of New South Wales :
First Assistant Fort Street Model School for Girls.
Mistress, East St. Leonards School. _
Assistant Mistress, Cleveland Street Public School.
Mistress, West Redfern Public School.
This testimony must appeal with commanding force to each mem-
ber of the Educational Department, showing what a nerve-soothing,
insomnia-killing, and health-restoring medicine they have in Clements
Tonic. All they need do is to try and persevere with it. The rest
with health are certain. Miss CARDWELL writes from her residence,
“Coree,” 45 Booth Street, Annandale, 27/8/’l3, thus
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“I have great pleasure in giving my testimony to the benefits derived
from Clements Tonic as a builder up when in a run-down condition.
“When teaching in the State Schools of New South Wales, I many
times resorted to its use, taking one to three bottles in course.
“The ever-constant strain on the nerves of a Public School Teacher
soon brings on a low state of the whole system. In my case it was over-
strain in teaching, and mental worry through family bereavements. I had
been taking in*escribed medicines, but seeing Clements Tonic advertised, I
tried one small bottle, and feeling so much benefit from its use, got the
larger size. It was such a restorative that, when I felt the least run-down,
lat once sent for Clements Tonic, and it never failed me. No househol
should he without it, or fail to use it in any case of over-strain, for 1 fee
sure it will have the desired effect.”
I am, Sirs, gratefully yours,
A. M. CARDWELL.

MAKE UP YOUR
MIND TO HAVE
A PERFECT
BUST
There are to-day hundreds of women who were once thin, flat-
bosomed, hollow-cheeked and generally scraggly in appearance, and
suffering the effects of anaemia and defective digestion, who are now for
the first time in their lives healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and
enjoying the full vigor of robust womanhood, as the result of a few
weeks under our wonderful
“FLESH-FOOD” TREATMENT.
Many women whose figures have been spoiled by maternal duties
have been entirely restored to splendid form, and flat-chested young
women who suffered slow development have had the fault corrected by
this treatment with lasting effect.
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is
beyond question, and its use no demand upon the subject’s time. Many
cases gained up to six pounds a week, and an increase in bust measure-
ment up to 8 and 10 inches. Guarantee given in every case.
ANY WOMAN who lacks good bust development lacks the one essential that creates a perfect
appearance. Lack of proper bust development, hollow cheeks and “salt-cellars” quickly take from
a woman the bloom and freshness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been your lot in
so far as natural development is concerned, but science has found a way to correct your deficiency.
Even though you have never been full-bosomed, and though you have been attenuated all your life,
if you suffer from no wasting disease, your bosom can be fully developed and your weight increased
to normal. , T HAS BEEN DONE FOR THOUSANDS WHY NOT YOU?
You can readily see the effect of an increase in your weight or measurements. It is not neces-
sary to imagine you are being benefited. See what Miss M. BOURKE, of Tamworth, says-
“Yonrs to hand, and am pleased to state that your treatment increased my
weight considerably over two stone, and my bust measurements by several
inches. Since using it T am much better in health, and my flesh is now firm
and I feel stronger and more vigorous. I thank you for the trouble you have
taken, and am grateful for all you have done for me.”
We publish an interesting book on the subject of attenuation and develop-
ment and will send same and a FREE SAMPLE TREATMENT to you FREE
OF CHARGE upon receipt of a 2d. stamp to pay part postage. All commumca-
tions private and confidential. Write or call to-day for full particulars. [lBlB

The Cafe De Fairfax.
It nestles ’neath the lofty walls
Of Mister James’ rag,
A refuge that at midnight calls
Late pilgrims of the jag;
Though others to its canvas halls
Belated hunger drag.
When ev’ry pub looks dark and dead,
And weirdly rings a laugh,
ThroiTgh empty streets are laggards led
To where its aproned staff
Serve out stewed steak, with scones or bread,
Tongues, smalls, or half-and-half.
Let others seek their costly grill,
But give me, flush or broke,
The place that lacks all pomp and frill,
Where waiting is a joke;
The servitors are Jack and Bill;
Each customer’s a bloke.
The oil-light limns a motley crew,
Drunk, toiler, broke and swell,
Assembled with a will to chew —
And this is safe to tell:
Regarding what they come to do
They do it very well.
Yet there is comradeship innate
Amongst them all. They mix,
And strangers know as “Jack” or “Mate,”
And points of law they fix,
While loudly blends the clattered plate
With sport or politics.
Above the Hekald’s dingy wall
Frowns sternly, many-eyed ;
I fancy Mister James and all
Must view with angry pride
That little democratic stall
That nestles by their side.
And at the stall I eat my pies,
And gulp my coffee down,
And wink towards the gloomy eyes
That from that building frown,
Where lives, so stodgy, dull and wise,
The staidest rag in town.
Let others oyst in gilded room,
Or in a hansom hie,
Where menus, bands and blossoms bloom ;
For me a humble pie
Beneath the disapproving gloom

Riches.
He had not wherewithal to buy
The little things the many need ;
And yet his seeming was a lie,
For he, I swear, was rich indeed.
His clothes were worn and soiled and old,
And held by many a patch and stitch;
But, tell me, is it only gold
That makes a mortal truly rich?
He knew no banquet-board, and still
(I vow by all the Muses nine!)
He fared with them who feast their fill
On better things than’cakes and wine.
When, plumed and painted overmuch,
Gay dames and damsels drew aside,
Lest he should taint them with a touch,
He saw a Vision starry-eyed.
That Vision nought on earth could soil —
No tress of gold make grey, I vow,
Nor Master Time with wrinkles spoil
The marble smoothness of its brow.
His deeds were few; yet this I know —
He dreamt of high and noble things ;
And dreaming thus, with eyes aglow,
Took rank above the rank of kings.
Beside him, night and noon, there stood
Two shapes that he alone could see,
And each was fair, and both were good,
And one was known as Memory.
And one was that fair Queen of Dreams
Who lifts the soul on spirit-wings,
And lights the sordid world with gleams
That men have called imaginings.
Though he had not the gold to buy
The little things the many need,
Was not his seeming all a lie?
And was he aught but rich indeed?

In a Garden.
All blossoms flung their scent with wanton
hands
Into the tresses of the summer night,
And, as the breezes blew the perfumed
strands
Across her face, she swooned for sheer de-
light.
The moonlight lay as softly on the flowers
As tender kisses dropped on sleeping eyes,
And cast a spell upon the fleeting hours,
Turning our laughter ere we knew to sighs.
A cactus flaming from its foil of green
With hidden daggers pierced the warm dusk
through;
And slender aloes thrust their spines be-
tween
The fronds the jacaranda crowned with blue.
And all the while the unseen crickets sent
Their little passionate chirpings from the
grass,
We fancied that the hooded night had bent
To whisper to us e’er she let us pass.
So we who did not know her mystic power,
Nor dreamed yet of the simple web she wove,
Made foolish vows we could not keep an
hour,
Trembled and laughed and kissed—and
called it love !

care as to methods of address.
business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-

the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters

the proper superscription for "copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-

NO LAND AVAILABLE.
On a certain recent day a man connected
with The Bulletin was afflicted by the
possession of a relative —a thing which is
ftot uncommon and may happen to anybody,
therefore no blame can be ascribed to either
party. The relative had heard vaguely of
the Northern Territory and was seized with
a desire to settle there, so he wrote to his
connection in this office asking that infor-
mation about land and other matters might
be dug up. His thirst for knowledge was
sent on to the External Affairs Department
—it is characteristic of the great lack of
official interest in the Territory that it isn’t
treated as part of Australia but is lumped
in with External concerns, as if it were
Chili or Timbwctoo. The Department
nroved to be courteous and gentlemanly, but
low-spirited. It replied as follows' (the
capitals are furnished in this office) :
There is at present NO agricultural or pastoral
LAND AVAILABLE for selection in the Territory.
Before such land can be thrown ooen for selection
it has to be classified by the Land Board at Darwin.
As soon as this is done, particulars will be pub-
lished in the Commonwealth Gazette specifying
the areas available and the conditions attaching to
their occupancy.
Some grazing and mixed farming blocks are about
to be made available for selection in the Territory
and a copy of the pamphlet containing full informa-
tion respecting water supply, area and locality of
the blocks, class of soil, etc., will be sent to vou as
soon as available.
This paper doesn’t propose to throw any
special clod at the Cook Government, which
hasn’t been long in office and is in such a
dreadful minority when the two Houses are
added up that it can do nothing except on
sufferance. Besides, the Cook Government
has intellectual limitations which must be
allowed for. Nor does it throw the whole
clod at any one Government in particular—
not even the one, whichever it was, that
pushed the Territory into the outer darkness
of External Affairs —for they seem to have
all inherited the same state of mind, and
the same indifference to the larger concerns
of Australia. Between the politicians who
didn’t want the Territory taken over because
it had no immediate votes of any importance,
and those who, for the same reason, don’t
really care a hang what becomes of it now
that it is taken over, there is little to
choose. Between Ministers who did badly
and Ministers who did nothing there is also
little to choose. This paper wouldn’t even
unduly rush the Laud Board at Darwin lest
that body should get up a perspiration. Nor
would it treat that institution, or any other
institution, with contumely except on good
evidence. Besides, in the absence of any
definite instructions as to the terms on which
land is to be let or sold, the Land Board at
Darwin can’t do much, But attention is
hereby drawn to the fact that in all
the great Federal Possession—the place
which is constantly being blamed because
it doesn’t attract settlors—there is NO .
LAND AVAILABLE. Yet the Common-
wealth’s own expert agent, after inspecting
the new Canaan from Dan to Beersheba,
reported that though Queensland is the
best of the old States, the Territory excels
even Queensland in the splendor of its pos-
sibilities.
The Fisher Government attempted to do
two things of imoortance for its big pro-
perty—to provide it with a land policy and
a railwav policy. Both were bad failures,
because both were devised with very little
view to the interests of the Possession, and
with very much view to the possibilities of
retaining votes in the older States. The
land scheme was an advertisement of the
tremendous resolve of the Ministry to adhere
to its policy of public ownership and its
desire to secure the unearned increment for
the nation, but it was calculated to make the
average land-seeker gather up his carpet-bag
and flee from the premises for bis life. Land
was to be Government leasehold only, which
was reasonable enough. The rent was to be
subject to periodical re-appraisements, which
was also reasonable enough provided the
re-appraisements weren’t so frequent as to
destroy all fixity of tenure. But, in addi-
tion, the. rent was to be liable to be raised
at odd times—apparently any day or every
week or twelve times a year—if new
Government works had been constructed,
which, in the opinion of the landlord (the
Government) enhanced the value of the
nropertv. There was, of course, to be some
form of anpeal—possibly an expensive and
long-winded one —to some Court appointed
by the landlord, against the landlord’s
opinion on the subject of rent. But appeals
are uncertain things, and if there was no
real limit to the possible number of rent
increases there would also be no real limit
to the possible number of appeals, and in a
very big country the Court is liable to be a
long way off and costly to reach. In tiny
case, the new settler wants to be nlougliing
and fencing— not appealing; and nobody
is likelv to invest money in improvements
on land which is held on something very
like a day-to-day tenure. Even the rich
landlords, whose exactions are impoverish-
ing Western Victoria, aren’t quite so ram-
pant in their terms, because they don’t want
to terrify to death the fowl that lays the
golden egg. In the desire to carry the policy
of public land-ownership to the last ex-
tremity it was proposed to give the tenant
no solid rights whatsoever, and possibly a
great many wrongs. It was sought to com-
pletely abolish the pleasant gamble—even
the smallest semblance of a gamble—in the
unearned increment, and seeing that the
Labor party is as fond as anybody else of
backing a horse, or taking a ticket in Tatt.’S,
or running an Art Union, the attempt was
excessive. No State Government exacts
such terms as regards its public lands, nor
is Daceyville or the resumed Rocks property
in Sydney managed on these principles.
Unfortunately the Territory, by reason of
its lack of voting power, is the place that
doesn’t matter. It served as an advertise-
ment of the Government’s devotion to the
principle of public ownership of land, and
when the scheme fell through because it
became too obviously impossible, no other
scheme was promptly substituted. The mat-
ter was hung up, and the Land Board was
left in futile perspiration at Darwin, and
there is NO LAND AVAILABLE. Yet, on
second thoughts, something has been done.
A small, lonesome farming settlement on the
Daly River is occasionally heard of. It is
said to be in process of abandonment, be-
cause it lies far out from anywhere, and the
same old curse of isolation is thick upon it.
Then it was decided by the Fisher
Government —and agreed by the Cook
Government —to extend the scrap of railway
a scrap further southward to the Katherine
River. Construction hasn’t really begun
yet, and nobody shows much enthusiasm
about the beginning of it. The prospect ex-
cites such skimpy hopes in the bosom of
External Affairs that nobody has been moved
to cut up great areas for settlement on the
strength of it. The work won’t connect any
section of the Territory with any other State
or with any centre which has population to
spare. It won’t reduce the isolation one
iota or. bring one of the existing big markets
one mile nearer. And thg scheme which
commences the railway at the north instead
of the south is a horrible advertisement for
the Territory in another sense. It concen-
trates all the new nopulation. the new
workers and the new Government activities
on the hot, muggv coastal strip. It helps
to fix the silly old delusion that the hot.
musrv.v* coastal strip and not the great, cool
tableland is the Territory, and thus it plays
into the hands of the nigger-labor push and
the anti-white Australia liars. Materials
for construction and supplies for the con-
structors are dear because they shamble to
the scene of action by a vast and costly
circuit. The employees are alleged to be
limp through being shot down suddenly in
the one part of the Territory where the
unacclimatised toiler is liable to feel limp
for three or four months of the year. These
people want extra pay for their limpness,
and labor troubles ensue. There is a great
increase in the volume of correspondence
setting forth that the grand old Territory
is no good, for the strangers fall easily into
the habit of assuming that the one hot corner
they have seen is the whole blessed place.
As usual, this splendid Federal asset —the
grandest property owned by any Government
on earth—having no voting power of its
own, is used as a mere pawn in the wretched
political game. It is the place that Cook
never heard of and the wilderness in which
Johnson sat on the alligator. The Federal
Government is pledged to finish the* line
from Port- Augusta to Darwin, but it is
strongly urged, by interested parties- to break
its pledge and make the connection with
Sydney and Brisbane instead. If it were to
start building in real earnest at the right
end. it must say whether it~is going to take
the line of honor or the track of political
expediency. In other words, it must commit
itself. Along one road it must risk losing
the support of Doodle, M.11.R. (S.A.), and
along the other it must take the chance of
making an implacable enemy of Boodle,
M.11.R. (N.S.W.), and Noodle, M.11.R.
(Queensland). The fragment of railway
which it is proposed to build is non-com-
mittal. It tends to show that the Territory
isn’t quite forgotten, but as it points no-
where in particular the work doesn’t
imply a declaration of war against Doodle,
who can’t be spared, nor is it a direct annoy-
ance to Boodle, who is essential, or Noodle,
who is liable to raise Sheol if things don’t go
his way. Even the seemingly-mild Poodle
down in Victoria, whose opinions are
divided as regards the route, and who may
really be a slumbering volcano, isn’t aroused.
* * * *
Meanwhile, as already mentioned, there
is NO LAND AVAILABLE. So far as is
known, there is no land policy available either,
As those in authority seem to have little br no
faith in their pretences and appear to regard
their schemes, not as devices for waking up
the Territory but rather as precautions
against waking up dangerous politicians, it
is possibly not worth while making land
available. For many years an isolated set-
tlement has been attempted in the one really
bad part of the Territory, and it failed be-
cause, while it was possible to get land that
was in direct connection with big centres of
population and big markets, the lonesome
place offered few attractions. The present
attempt is the same old attempt over again
on a slightlv more pretentious scale, but
with less heart and soul in the business.
There are more officials, but there seems to
be not so much sincerity. Still hope isu’t
wholly lost.. Out of the 523,620 square miles
—much of it splendid land —some areas may
be made available in course of time. The
Land Board is still struggling with the vast
orb of its fate at Darwin.
THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESIST-
ANCE.
A certain, or uncertain, or hazy Quaker
named Brown has come to Australia. Ho
has mildly denounced this country’s very
humble Defence policy, and has risen, in
moderation and without blasphemy, to
preach the doctrine of humility and of tak-
ing: it lying down. The Sydney Telegraph,
which interviews all the passing cranks, gave
him some ispace, and the following is part of
the report:—
The London Quaker deputationist, Mr. Alfred 11.
Brown, believes that the Commonwealth has no need
to resort to arms to defend itself.
In the course of an interview yesterday, shortly
after his arrival in Sydney, he gave the following
illustration of the Quaker policy of defence: —
“You sometimes see a boy putting up his fists to
hit another boy. But the other boy makes no move-
ment. He only smiles. There is no fight. The
bellicose boy becomes ashamed of himself.”
In a word, the Quakers act on the proverb, “It
takes two to make a fight.” That the Quaker policy
of not being “one of the two” will prote effective in
all cases to prevent bloodshed may be doubted by
some people. The Quakers, however, have strong
testimony to support such a belief. First of all,
there was William Penn. He and his little colony
lived in the midst of the wild Red Indians for 60 or
70 years. The Indians were constantly at war with
other Indian tribes, but not a single Quaker ever
suffered injury at their hands. The reason was that
the Quakers lived with their doors wide open, and
they never carried arms. As soon as the Quaker
administration ceased in Pennsylvania, and men armed
themselves, the Indians began to slay the white man.
In the same fashion and for the same reasons the
Quakers passed through the Indian Mutiny and the
Irish Rebellion without a single Quaker being killed.
Recalling this testimony, Mr. Brown said: “The
fact that a man is known as a peaceable man consti-
tutes his surest defence. In the midst of the Indian
massacres the Quakers slept with their doors open,
and none of them were injured.”
Discussing the existing compulsory enlistment Act,
Mr. Brown strongly condemned it, not only because
it was directly opposed to his principles "of peace,
but also because compulsion would tend to destroy
the patriotism of the lads. He declared that this
compulsion to carry arms was causing about a dozen
Quaker families to leave Australia, and would have
the effect of checking immigration. He believes there
are about 1000 Quakers “on the books” in Australia,
and many others who emigrated from England and
have been “lost.”
* * * *
It is a pleasant theory on top, but rather
anti-Christian underneath. According to
the Quaker view that no person is
injured provided he maintains a peaceful
attitude, it is implied that the Saviour
wouldn’t have been crucified unless he had
hit Pilate in the eye, or been unduly aggres-
sive to the Scribes and Pharisees and the
priests. And by the Quaker doctrine, all
the saints and martyrs met with their woes
because they didn’t assume the proper non-
aggressive position. For, according to the
mental asnect of the Society, this is a good,
kind world in which no bad man smites any
good man unless the good man smites him
first. And as the good man never smites
the bad man either first or second, therefore
all good people are immune from wrong and
injustice, and only bad people are damaged
- —by other bad neople. In consequence
of this state of affairs soldiers are needless,
and police and magistrates and judges are
superfluous, and bolts and bars and locks
and safes and strong boxes are not required,
except to protect wicked characters who
hardly deserve protection. Ours is the best
of all possible globes, and its records of in-
sult and injury and torture and fraud and
rape and mutilation done on kindly, unoffend-
ing Early Christians and such-like are mere
inventions.
The Quakers’, own records are not pleasant
reading. In their early days, despite the
pleasant smile they gave to the persecutor,
they were lavishly hogged and imprisoned,
and had their goods confiscated, and their
ears cut off, and their tongues bored with hot
irons. When the pretty Quaker girl came
hack from seeing the Amalekite in office she
wasn’t good to look upon, and both her back
and her face were in disrepair. These things
might convince the average Quaker that the
doctrine of non-resistance was a success, but
people of sturdier build would prefer to be
rough and hostile to the fiogger and the
gaoler. Yet with all liis troubles the Quaker
had one streak of luck ; he usually hung out
his non-resistant banner in some land where
there were plenty of sturdy and probably
un-Christian fighting men to defend him
from foreign aggression. Only once in all
its long career did the broad-brimmed sect
pretend to found a Quaker State and to try
its doctrine of non-resistance and Christian
forbearance on a hostile race, and Pennsyl-
vania, despite all the bogus advertisement
that has been spent upon it, was something of
a joke. The early Swedish and Dutch settlers
and the non-Quaker English helped a lot to
save the pioneering Friends from destruc-
tion in the early days. But even William
Penn, the boss Quaker and the shining light
of the new Paradise, was driven, a very few
years after its establishment, to organise
some kind of a force to defend the borders.
In 1699, when the State had hardly cut its
first tooth, the leader was struggling with
the pirates who raided his kindly people and
took their girls and their goods. Not long
after, the Indians came along in dead earnest
and made ashes of a part of the
Quaker land, and Pennsylvania had to raise
a militia and build forts and vote money for
defence, and in other ways plug along god-
less paths of violence. And in 1764 a force,
partly Quaker and partly German, garrisoned
Philadelphia with the gun of wrath and the
pike that leadeth unto destruction, it being
a time of serious trouble when Susan and
Rachel and Ruth were threatened by
the Philistines, and verv angry and drunken
Philistines at that. Then the Scoto-Irish
settlers drove the Quakers from the control
of affairs, on the ground that their non-re-
sistance was a failure, while their resistance
was inefficient. They were accused of being
half-and-half, or shandygaff, or dog’s-nose, or
some other mixed drink. The slaughter of
white men was going strong in Pennsylvania,
and the Quaker G.overnment didn’t wholly
lie down and be humble, or wholly stand up
with arms in its hands and be arrogant.
It is quite possible that no Quakers were
killed in the Indian Mutiny, but then it is
also quite probable that there wasn’t a
single Quaker in the comparatively small
area affected by the Mutiny. And it is
equally possible that no Quakers were killed
in the Irish rebellion —presumably that of
1798 is meant. There were hardly any
Quakers in Ireland then, and the patriots of
’9B weren’t addicted to the slaying of non-
combatants. No more kindly crowd of
“rebels” ever infested the earth. The
Friends of to-day are a scanty folk.
They are said to number about 122,000,
so if they all failed to come to Aus-
tralia they would hardly be missed. About
100,000 are in the United States, and some-
where about 17,000 in Great Britain. In
Ireland, where a Quaker might get trodden
on by accident in a discussion between a
well-meaning Nationalist and a kindly
Orangemen, there are only about 2000. In
countries, however prosperous and well-
governed and well-defended, where there is
a chance for the Quaker to be a martyr by
refusing to do his term of military service,
there are very, very few of him. In coun-
tries where the Government is weak and
corrupt, and strong men fend for them-
selves, and the Quaker, unless he departs
from his creed altogether, has to quell the
brigand or the savage by kindness and the
present of a sample of American
tinned goods and a Testament, there
are practically none of him. He locks his
door at night like any other citizen, and
sticks close to the protection of an ungodly
police and a swashbuckler soldiery. He
isn’t by any means a pioneer, his one futile
attempt in that line having been enough for
him, and more than enough, and a great deal
too much. If the Quaker would go to the
front and prove his doctrines by actual ex-
periment upon rude, coarse tribes, the world
might take him seriously, but his clamorous
adherence to the peaceful back row of things
prevents his aosDel having a fair chance.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Hulumn and his Tory Government.
One of the happy jests of the Political
Labor League Conference recently held at
Sydney was the presentation by Minister
Trifling or Trivial or Trefle of the report
of the Agricultural Committee. Clause IV.
read in this fashion: —
The opening of new ports and the connecting of
border railway* to give producers the easiest access to
markets.
This is affecting, and it would be impressive
if the gang of Tory backsliders and dodgers
and city and suburban landlords which calls
itself a Labor Government was a little less
glaring in its political hypocrisy, and _ a
little less subservient to the congestion
policy of the Sydney conservative dailies,
and to the interests of the Sydney property-
owners. But its record is against it. It
once professed to have a great scheme on
hand for connecting Western Iliverina with
its nearest port, Melbourne; hut when the
scheme was rejected it hardly made a. decent
pretence of being annoyed. It is taking the
North Coast railway round in a great, ex-
pensive circuit to avoid touching Port
Stephens, and giving that splendid harbor a
chance to do some business. And as the
railway could hardly be extended to Bom-
bala without an agitation arising for a fur-
ther extension to Twofold Bay, the promised
Bombala railway did a sort of perish at


Nimmitabel, and has bee^
tes'ToS shuffling Two 'things that take the
Se are the Holman Government s pre-
tendedcraving for decentralisation and its
alleged hunger for'State ownership of land.
The° idea of creating State-owned cities on
places like Port Stephens or Jervis Bay or
Twofold Bay, and thus competing against
the private landlords of Sydney, makes it so
very cold about the feet that it won t even
mention the dreadful possibility.
Deadlock.
Tasmania’s little isle, having acquired an
Assembly in which the Government follow-
ing numbers 15 and the Opposition the same,
Party Government is “up against it.” The
Government has to find a Speaker, and it
the parties sit tight, and no Oppositionist
can be corrupted, it must find a Speaker out
of its own ranks. In a House where the
numbers are equally divided and the party
system is strictly adhered to, this act would
put it in a minority of one, and being
promptly licked and shot out in consequence
of its minority, the other lot would naturally
come in. And unless the other lot could buy
over an opponent, it would also come in
simply to go out again. In fact, under the
party system, if honestly conducted, the only
crowd that could possibly be in power would
be the crowd that was out of office, and the
crowd that was out of office couldn’t get into
office without losing office. It is a silly sort
of business, by which a presumably intelli-
gent community ties itself into a hard knot,
and becomes incapable, by its own conduct,
of conducting its own business. If the busi-
ness consisted simply of passing laws and
doing acts of administration for the good of
the people, and everybody could vote on each
Bill or clause or proposal solely in what he
believed to be the interests of the people,
nrobably things would go smoothly enough.
There would generally be a definite majority
for or avainst. and the Speaker’s casting
vote would settle the matter if it couldn’t be
settled otherwise. But, in the great majority
of cases, and no matter how members
labelled themselves, the Speaker’s casting
vote wouldn’t be required. Unfortunately,
under the system which makes a Minister—
unlike a scavenger or cook or clerk or civil
servant —liable to be sacked without notice
and on general principles, the case doesn’t
turn on the merits of the measures put before
the House. It depends on the Vote of
Censure, and the Motion of Censure, when
reduced to plain language, reads thus :
That the Honorable Members, now in possession
of the Loaves and Fishes, should be torn from those
Lucrative Provisions, and the Honorable Members
who are now deprived of the Aforesaid Provender
should be endowed with the Nutritious Substances
hereinbefore specified.
That is a proposition on which every member
can vote according to straight Party prin-
ciples, without violating his conscience.
Therefore, unless some member is bought
over, or takes to drink and doesn’t know
which way he is going, or becomes a habitual
absentee, the very ordinary accident of one
half the House being labelled one thing and
one half the other thing brings the country’s
business to a dead stop. And neither prefer-
ential voting nor second ballots, nor the
Referendum (valuable as it is), nor the
Initiative, nor the Recall can materially
alter the situation. A si mule-looking remedy
would be to have the Ministry elected by
the new Parliament as soon as it meets, and
fixed for the space of three years. In the
rare cases when Parliament was so eoually
divided and so rigidly adhesive to Party
lines that no one could be elected, the matter
might be referred to the peonle, voting as
one constituency. Then the Motion of Cen-
sure and the struggle for the Boaves and
Fishes would cease to disturb the Legisla-
ture. and no party would fear td provide a
Speaker, and no member need refuse the
Sneakership if the pleasant billet came his
way. and even' member could vote on every
measure according to his conscience without
considering how his note would influence bis
nartv’s immediate chance of securing the
dignities and the remuneration and the lien
on the official motor-car. None of these
nuestions cmld arise again unt'l aUer next
election. The change might deprive poli-
ticians of some amusement, but it ought to
heP business along, which is the thing that
really counts.
’
The Unclean Pub.
“Ugh”: What’s the explanation of this?
Regularly I read in the police-court reports
that some seller of small goods in a lost or
strayed suburb has been fined for uncleanli-
ness in his kitchen or fowlhouse, or that an
ice-cream prince doing business between
siestas in the Domain has been bounced be-
fore the beak by the Health Department
and charged with possessing contaminated
cups or spoons. Good enough. I’m always
glad to hear it. but why this exclusive atten-
tion to the trader who, compared to the dirty
publican, is a mere cipher in the germ-
developing and distributing business? Does
anybody know of one solitary, lonely in-
stance where the Health Department or any
other department has taken one of Sydney’s
many disgusting booze traders before a
court? I’ll bet. no. The disturbing or sus-
picious thing about it is that there is no
difficulty in getting a case. In fact, even in
mid-city it is the. exception to find a system
of cleanly liquor-serving, while in the sub-
urbs the methods are frequently putrid. I
was in the bar of a Western suburban so-
called good hotel the other evening where
glasses were being slopped in and out of a
tub of liquid characteristic of that common
to a pig’s trough. That is plain fact. I
ventured to remonstrate with the fat, sullen
party (he was the boss) who served me, and
I was thrown a snarl that he was running
the business, not me. I believed him. The
only difference between that dirty and dan-
gerous vendor to the public—he endangers
the health of hundreds for every one that
the saveloy-distributor and ice-cream poten-
tate can operate on —is that he kept his pig
trough where it could be seen, whereas the
average trough is located under the counter,
and, consequently, out of sight. But the
evil is so prevalent that even the Health
Department’s officers should be able to dis-
cover it (provided there is any anxiety in
that direction). In fact, a blind man could
track it with his nose. That would lead
him to the frequently stinking drying towels
which, as likely as not, spread on the glasses
cancer, syphilis and other horrors, if their
germs happen to be sluiced off in the trough.
Syphilis as a Punishment.
From a doctor who lias specialised in
infectious diseases: —
A favorite Wowser argument against any organ-
ised effort to deal effectively with venereal disease
is that syphilis is a GoD-sent punishment for incon-
tinence. The God of the Wowser must be an eccen-
tric sort of deity, judging from the evidence
recently given by Dr. Sequira, of the London Hos-
pital. Under his care was a girl of 12 infected
with syphilis by her own mother’s kiss. A woman
patient came into the hospital with secondary
syphilis, carrying a baby suffering from the same
disease in an inherited form. She also had with
her two little children, both of whom had been
infected with syphilis in the mouth from kissing
the baby. The same authority related the case
of a glassblower’s boy who had contracted syphilis
on the lip from using a blowpipe which had been
handed to him by an infected glassblower for finish-
ing off a bottle. At an evening party, some time
before Dr. Sequira gave his evidence, some kissing
game was played, and at this party one person with
a syphilitic spre on the mouth infected nearly every
girl present. Another case was that of a cook on
a railway dining-car who came straight from his
work in such a condition as to need immediate ad-
mission to hospital. He was described by Sequira
as “one of the worst cases of syphilis I have seen.”
How many people he may have infected by means
of table utensils and articles of food is a matter for
interesting speculation. Add to these and other
innumerable well-attested innocent infections —the
frequent accidental infections of doctors, nurses and
students, from performing a post-mortem examina-
tion, attending a confinement, being accidentally
bitten or scratched by a patent, making an exam-
ination, or dressing a wound —and the God of the
Wowsers appears as a very eccentric deitv indeed.
In fact, He is scarcely to be trusted by the Wowser
himself. If the evening party described by Sequira
had been a Sunday-school picnic at which kiss-in-
the-ring occupied its usual prominent position
amongst the sports, the holiest of Wowsers might
have developed some new views on the subject of
divine punishment for moral offences. The Out
Patient Committee of the London Hospital has
recentlv recorded its opinion as follows: “for the
good of the race, and for the good of the children
vet to be, an organised war on the spirochete of
svphilis should begin. Dr. Bulloch states that if
the weapons at our hand were wisely used syphilis
would be as rare as is small-pox in the course of a
generation.” “If the weapons in our hands were
wisely used” —can any fiercer indictment of the
social machinery of modern civilisation be con-
ceived ?
Randolph Bedford defends his position: —
Various Bulletin contributors object to my
“idealisation” of Tyson (as they call it). I treated
Tyson as a man of his time and an inevitable pro-
duct of it. He “did nothing for art or literature,
certainly ; and probably he did that nothing because
-vhpn made his habits there wasn’t any art or
literature in Australia to help. He certainly did not have
any graces of manner, and he may have been “uncouth
to the mind of any person who was quite opposite to
Tyson. But Australian internal development was
not made by duchesses or people with pretty bedside
manners or enthusiasts in art or literature, necessary
as all such people are in the making of a country.
Australia was made by the large and often coarse and
uncouth men of one idea, each working his own idea
to the logical conclusion. But for men who were
mostly as innocent of the affectedly cultured manners
of i.nrrl Chester vie no (who was in his proper job
as Groom to the Bedchamber) as they were ignorant
of the rotten dishonesties of mind and his general
treacherousness of character, the goldfields which
made Australia —the goldfields which made a market
which made Tyson —might never have been discov-
ered.
I “idealised” Tyson, then, only as a man I once
met, and as the man whom an excellent judge of
character, such as big Jim Wilkinson, knew inti-
mately ; as a man who had done good for himself
and liis country at the same time; who had made
millions without hurting anybody. And that appre-
ciation of him I repeat. My critics apparently fail
to see this man because his money hides him —though
there was nothing disgraceful about his money, except
the way it was spent. They object to him being, as
they allege, quick off the mark with foreclosures, and
then make a great success as mind-readers, by dis-
covering that he rarely lent on mortgage except with
an eye to foreclosure. Why not? It’s done every
day, and it’s quite legitimate. What do they want —
advances up to 90 per cent, of the valuation, so that
it wouldn’t pay to foreclose if the interest got into
arrears? Tyson committed the crime of having three
or four millions more than I have, and for that
reason these people want me to find nothing admirable
in him. Is there any man in Australia who can put
his finger on a mean or treacherous or dishonest action
of Tyson’s? If so, let us hear of him.
What arrant nonsense to call the man’s way of
dressing anyhow—the ragged bootlaces and the old
dark grey coat, and all the rest of the carelessness
of habit—affectation and playing to the gallery!
Had he dressed like a German Jew financier who is
about to be introduced to an English king, he would
have been an empty fop. With his work filling his
life, his methods of dressing were as careless as thev
could become. While conserving decency, they call
his rags part of a scheme of playing to the gallery !
Tyson was not conceited in the little senses ; he. was
self-centred. Where did I “idealise” him? I claimed
for him the bushman’s virtues—courage, endurance,
enterprise, self-denial. Who shall say he did not have
them ?
The interminable business of importing
ships has at last reached a climax. Last
week the dear old Ma State imported a
wreck. It wasn’t a nuw inter-State liner
that went to smash, but a small, peddling
thing called the Cambewarra, intended for
the South Coast blue metal trade, and speci-
ally fitted for that purpose with a huge, top-
heavy crane like a Carthaginian’s nose. A
local shipmaster who knows the dreaded
“southerly bustes” that periodically, sweeps
the N.S.W. coast was firmly of opinion that
the curious little import, handicapped as it
was by its heavy gear and its lifeless cargo,
would' be lost in the first wind it met. But
the import was fated never to reach its
feckless purchasers or the place where the
“buster” rages. It bumped the Westralian
coast one’ calm morning last week, and
very soon the product of a, Dutch shipyard
had disapueared from the world of visible
assets. The position may now be summed
up this way :
(1) The unspeakable N.S.W. roads will be worse
than usual for months, because the imported craft
bought with borrowed money has been lost, and is,
th-ref ore, unavailable for metal carrying.
(2) Some of Cohen’s capital, on which interest
has to be paid, is submerged on a coast where there
are too many obstructions already.
(3) The wages which would have kept some Aus-
tralian shipwrights in work have gone to Dutchmen.
(4) Some more is going just as soon as they can
start on another import.
(5) Some valuable shipbuilding experience has
been lost to the people of this continent, and a
second lot will be lost as soon as possible.
(6) The Australian has been further advertised
abroad as an incapable islander who would not be
able to travel by sea but for the superior skill of
intelligent foreigners.
It is enough to make local patriots writhe
to see Jap-built liners like the Tango Maru
dwarfing the Circular Quay warehouses,
while Australian State Governments inflate
the foreigner with orders for pottering
dredges and little stone carriers. For the
sake of our national self-respect, let us have
a duty on imported ships—and imported
wrecks.
“Granite’s” few reflections :
Minister for Works Griffith has been spared some
trouble by the wrecking of the s.s. Cambewarra, off
Fremantle (W.A.). This costly craft was built in
Holland to the order of the N. S. Wales Government
to run in the Kiama blue metal trade, and was fitted
with a patent contraption, or hypodermic syringe, in
the bows by means of which the loading and unload-
ing of the stone was to be facilitated and cheapened.
The patent device was welcomed by the customers of
the Government, but the stone-lumpers weren’t enthu-
siastic. Indeed, they were , blastiferous. The stone-
dumping union is a close trade corporation. The
wages are governed by overtime, which is so large
that the men are the best-paid manual workers in
the State. At present, the little s.s. Kiama is
engaged tearing up and down the coast in a breath-
less effort to drag up enough output from the Kiama
quarries to satisfy all the metropolitan municipali-
ties. So, as soon as it arrives at either end, there
is a scurry to load or unload, irrespective of the
time of day or night. Hence the big wages earned.
These workers didn’t view with delight the news
that Griffith was importing a machine to do four
times as much work as they could do at a fraction
of the cost, and they were credited with the inten-
tion of manufacturing trouble if the Cambewarra on
arrival turned out to be a success. The disturbance
was all the more likely in view of the understanding
that if the anticipated satisfactory results eventu-
ated, another vessel of the same class was to be
procured. This meant practically wiping the stone-
jugglers off the map. The wreck postpones the
clash until another Cambewarra is built, and deliv-
erv made, which, with the approval of Providence,
will be as soon as possible.
♦
Squatter Hay, of Coolangatta, lias not
much opinion of the N.S.W. South Coast
farmers. He declares that the Illawarra is
not the district it used to be 25 or 30 years
ago, and unless some change is made for the
better it will cease to be known as “the
garden of the State.” His suggested remedy
is a holy gem. He proposes that the Govern-
ment should establish an experimental farm,
which would be subsidised out of the Berry
bequest to the extent of £ISOO to £IBOO per
annum. There should be 50 students, im-
ported youths, who, on completion of their
training, could be distributed among the
farmers to assist them with their expert
knowledge. Evidently Mr. Hay does not
regard the local farmer’s son as a fit subject
for scientific training with a view to advis-
ing his old man. The short and simple
annals -of a great part, at all events, of the
Illawarra district are that., in the struggle
to pay the rent, the farmer has had to drag
the immortal soul out of the land till it has
become impoverished. And when the land-
lord who got all this rent dies, he isn’t even
buried on his miserable tenant’s property to
enrich the soil. The amount of nitrogen in
a landlord is quite remarkable, and yet he is
put away in the family vault, so that it is
all wasted.
“Shipping Clerk” writes :
Sydney Harbor authorities haven’t said any-
thing out loud about an incident which occurred on
February 5, when a big' tramp steamer, drawing 29ft.
odd, touched bottom, while leaving Port Jackson.
The vessel was in mid-channel with the marks in
line when those on board distinctly felt it bump.
Whether it hit the bottom or a floating anchor or
other obstruction has not been made public, but
that there was mighty little water underneath the
steamer is quite certain. The perjured case for the
port largely rests on the assertion that the Port
Jackson main channels can without dredging carry
water up to 40ft., whereas the truth is that any-
thing like this depth can be reckoned on only
within narrow limits. The day isn’t far off when the
neglected deep-water ports will come into their own.
Meanwhile, if Sydney is to compete with a place like
Hobart, where dredges are unknown, and accommo-
date the biggest modern vessels, costly deepen-
ing operations will be necessary in the near future.
“Vic.”: A Parliamentary Commission has
handed in a scathing report on the Closer
Settlement vagaries of Premier Bent, whose
lands minister was Yawn Murray. The
management is slaughtereu unmercifully. It
seems the amount spent on the purchase of
estates was £3,103,731, of which vacant lots
represent £341,704. Of these vacant lots
£75.228 worth have been abandoned by the
settlers. They were a progressive lot, these
lessees, and they progressed into the Credit
Foncier strong-room to the extent of
£160,127, of which no less than £125,000 is
in arrears. Fifteen of the large estates
purchased have proved to be quite unsuit-
able, and the transaction has a distinct odor
of unburied rat. The Secretary of the Com-
mission believes that the Government has
been let in very considerably by fraud
through applicants being allowed to select
before the land selected was purchased from
the squatters. Many of these pre-purchase
selectors have defaulted, and the most .of
such transactions are suspected of being
what is known in the vulgar tongue as “put
up jobs.” It is a vast and arrogant swindle.
Yet it might have been a vast and arrogant
success. Private speculators have made a
profitable business of buying estates to sub-
divide them —but then P.E> puts on the
screw all the time and gets its money’s worth,
whereas the Government of Victoria just
butted in like a good old milch cow, and its
butting didn’t pay.
“Miles,” more in sorrow than in anger:
I am with “Battler” (B. 8/1/T4), in his dis-
paraging remarks about Australia’s citizen forces. I
have been connected with them for many years now,
and can assert there never was a time within my
memory when they were so untrained and undis-
ciplined. Only those who are doing the work know
what the officers are up against these days. On
paper our Defence scheme is a great. success, iff
practice, it is making in the direction of rank
failure. The fault lies, not with the officers (Lord
knows they do their best!), but with those who
framed the foolish regulations. The infantry soldier,
for instance, has to do 16 days’ training per year*
eight days of which must be spent in camp, ihis
means that, for the rest of the year, he has to put
in the eouivalent of only eight days to be marked
efficient. You can’t teach a man even elementary
drill in the time; and the result is that four out of
the eight days in camp, which should be devoted to
higher training, are wasted teaching squad, section,
company and battalion drill. As two days are s P<-' rl t
travelling to and from the camp, there remains but
two days for manoeuvres, from which the man in tne
ranks learns nothing. In a great many • cases the
trainees are eager enough to learn, and take an
interest in the work; but there is another section,
and not a small one, which attends drill only because
it has to, and while there harasses the instructors as
much as possible. This type of youth will go a long
way towards wrecking the scheme, unless he is taken
in hand at once, and instructors are given more
opuortunities to drill a little manliness into him.
All officers regret that night drills have been practi-
cally cut out, in deference to persons who wowse;
for' it was at those drills that officers got to know
their companies, and were able to instil discipline
into them. Some fond parents, however, set up a
wail that their Willie would have to be out at
night and would get into bad ways, so Willie is
now free to stand at the corner of the street and spit
at the kerbstone. But he won’t stop a Jap. soldier
by spitting at him, however well he can do it; and,
for his own morals and the country’s safety, his
nights were better spent learning to defend the home
which will surely call for defence some day.
Apparently the easy casualness with which
Australia’s champion airman, Harry
Hawker, steps into his machine and goes
for a flight as one would take a run in a
motor, has stirred or shamed the Defence
authorities into doing something with the
four Bristol biplanes which ex-Defence Min-
ister Pearce ordered away back in July of
the year before last. The machines, together
with four mechanics and two certificated air-
men, duly arrived and have remained stored
up or bushed or lost ever since. First a
“ground” was necessary—though Hawker
merely runs his weapon out on to the street
and soars up forthwith —so a huge paddock
at Altona Bay was engaged. Then a hangar
must be erected — Hawker uses an ordinary
motor garage—so a contract was let for one
at £4lO0 —the four ’planes only cost £3460.
The hangar (shed) isn’t finished yet; in fact,
it is hardly begun yet, but the Department
has got a move on; it has bought a motor
lorry to hump the ’planes from place to place
—as if they couldn’t fly from place to place
—and has engaged motor-cars for the use of
the mechanics and attendants.. The whole
thing would constitute a shrieking joke if it
wasn’t that there is tragedy behind it. If
the Government would—rand could—engage
Hawker, and give.him full authority and
instructions to go ahead, it could probably
have an efficient flying: corps in a year or
two. But then Haw.ker is an Australian,
and it is always necessary to have .an im-
ported expert to make a fool of a job like
that.
More Loans, Less Rain and Roaring
Times.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sum of £25,800.000 was subscribed for the
Maoriland loan of £4,500,000....
The New South Wales revenue in January showed
a smaller increase than in any previous month of the
current financial year....
South Australia is issuing a loan for £2,000,000

ing 4 per cent, bonds for sale over the counter for
terms of 5, 10 and 15 years. The prices are 964,
954 and 944-•••
On the whole, January was rather a poor month as
regards rainfall. —News items (all oil the same day.')
There’s a wet sleet falling far away in
Loandon Town,
And the lamps illumine pavements of a
dreary, hopeless brown,
Where the shuffling, unkempt hawkers tramp
the gutters in despair.
And the outcasts sit and shiver
On the seats above the river,
Where the oozy ripples quiver in the damp
and biting air.
All day long the traffic’s booming through
the streets of Loandon Town ;
All the year long, rain or sunshine, go the
people up and down ;
Now ’tis February weather —reeking fog, and
mud, and cold —
And the Capital stupendous.
Where they make the cash they lend us,
Wears a pali of smoke tremendous as
whelmed Pompeii of old.
Banks and offices are verv busy now in
Loandon Town,
And the clerks are growing dizzy with the
figures they put down ;
For the Money Mills are working to the
limit of their span :
Tn the streets stalk Want and Sorrow,
But the boom may burst to-morrow. _
And the whole world’s out to borrow —with
Australia in the van.
See ! The same old Mat of Welcome lies out-
side the Same Old Door,
And the Same Old Sign is hanging where it
always,' hung of yore ;
For it’s DhoTb’s Day in Loandon, and the
Loan-Drunks’ reg-i-ment.
With their paner bugles blowin’
Are parading before Gotten,
Madly bent on further owin’ while their
names are worth a cent!
’Tis a proud day for Australia, for her
leaders bear the brunt
In the game of Pawn-the-Future — they are
easily in front!
Long ago they pledged the Present in the
Loan-Cup of the .Tew,
But those sums could not content them,
So, on finding they had spent them,
To the Cup once more they bent them —and
they’re raising it anew !
Hocus-pocus, and Hey presto! Lo, the
vision fades away ;
And, behold, our own Australia on a blazing
summer day:
Hot and brilliant is the sunshine, and the
dust is all about —
Fverytliing is dry and splendid.
For the rain has not descended,
Though the Loan Jag has not ended, we are
getting near a drought.
But, who cares? A fig for croakers! Though
the fend is dry and brown —
Though our imports are gigantic and our
revenues are down —
Though we’ve nearly reached the Limit of
our credit and renown. —
Our prosperity’s surprising—
The expenditure is rising,
While Government advertising is a credit to
the Crown!
We’re all right, thanks be to Uncle up in
Loandon, cold and drear!
Never mind bis shivering outcasts. We re-
quire the money here !
Our amazing wealth and sunshine, our re-
sources. our grand Debt,
And the Boa ring Times we’re having
Show the folly of mere saving;
So, though Drought’s brown flag is waving,
- we will drain the Loan Cup yet!
Then, three rousing cheers for Uncle and
for Loandon grim and grev!
Where our Lean-Drunks are parading in the
good; old-fashioned way.
While we skite about Our Future —which
belongs to GoD-Knows-Who !
Till we set about returning
All the money we are burning—
Oh, there’ll be a snaU-like yearning to repay
it —when we do.

The Yarn of the Dusty Capital.
Sydney Telegraph lias broken out again re
the dry-hash Federal capital site of Can-
berra, which has been in grievous trouble of
late, and badly requires a trifle of advertise-
ment and apology and some whitewash on
its sepulchre. This is the best part of the
Telegraph’s narrative: —
As Mr. Cook is still in control of the Home Affairs
Department, it is up to him as a man who has
fought many stirring battles for the rights of New
South Wales under the capital section of the Con-
stitution, to see that his official staff is kept. con-
tinuously on the move till Canberra becomes a
reality. Mr. Cook was far-sighted enough to bring
from Chicago Mr. Griffin, the winner of the first
prize in the planning competition. The absence of
Mr. Griffin in the United States has been respon-
sible for some of the recent delays, but when he
returns there ought to be no further hesitation in
pushing right on until Parliament is ready to occupy
its new quarters. It is regrettably the case that
some Victorian influences are still active on the side
of frustrating the work by protests against the ex-
penditure. But the majority in the two Federal
Houses is definitely committed to completing Can-
berra, and New South- Wales will look to its mem-
bers, no matter which party they belong to, to see
that the compact is kept.
It is a curious business —that “compact.”
It was agreed that the capital was to be
in N.S.W., and the capital was fixed in
N.S.W., at Dalgety, on the swift and clean
and ever-flowing Snowy River—the one river
in N.S.W. which didn’t fail or stagnate even
in the lamentable 1902 drought. The place
had a good port handy, and an abundance
of cheap water-power for lighting and heat-
ing and manufacturing. But there was
among the parish-minded and congestion
folk a demand for a capital in some poor
region where it couldn’t become more than
“a large country town,” as the Sydney Tele-
graph frankly described the future Can-
berra, and couldn’t possibly be a rival to
Sydney ; also where its little scrap of trade
might be conveniently annexed by Sydney. The
Herald and Telegraph, the two unlettered
rags which used to tell their readers at great
length how Captain Cook was the original
discoverer of Australia, clamored for Can-
berra, which, seeing that their interests
mostly lie in Sydney, didn’t look so well as
it might have done. In fact, it looked like
using national interests for purposes of pri-
vate profit. Cook and Conroy and J. C.
Watson and Hughes and the rest of the
old Sydney push clamored also. The other
States, as they couldn’t have the capital
themselves, took little interest in the matter,
so it was mostly left to the N.S.W. members,
and they were mostly dominated by the igno-
rant but rich and vociferous papers which
thought that Cook discovered Australia. The
Sydney end of the Federal Labor party
threw dirt at the Referendum principle when
it was proposed to apply it to the capital
question. No vote was taken of the people
of Australia or even of the people of
N.S.W. The matter was just scrambled
through. And to-day even the advocates of
Canberra don’t know quite what to do about
their glorious site. The regular dry season
has come. The alleged rivers which were
to make the Federal capital another Venice
are to a great extent off duty. The dust
storms are bad. The labor troubles are bad
also, and they are mostly based on the diffi-
culty of getting something to drink which
hasn’t a green scum on top and a
dead rabbit below. Nobody seems to have
much heart to push on with the business.
Now the Telegraph, by way of side-stepping
the issue, sets the sluggishness down to the
temporary absence of Griffin, the Yankee
expert, and considers in its inmost stomach
that all will be well when he comes back.
But Griffin is only a cheap young man at
best. If he had been anything else he would
never have come all the wav from Chicago
for a mere £IOOO a year. A first-class expert
would have cost several times the money.
Anyhow, the people here have Griffin’s
plans, specifications and ideas. They can’t
be lielnlessly dependent on Griffin, seeing
that all the existing Australian cities were
built without his aid. Also this country
probably knows a vast amount more about
water with scum on top and dead rabbits
underneath than Griffin ever heard of.
The real trouble isn’t too little Griffin, but
too much Canberra.
Apparently there is a belated chance that
N.S.W. may get the totalisator in place of
the bookmaker, though it is mentioned that
the State Ministry is divided on the subject,
while the Opposition is certainly divided,
and the pious section of the press is so badly
divided that about nine-tenths of it is on the
side of Isaac Shortodds. It is a pity that
there should be so much division ; the thing
arouses suspicion. The advocates of the
tote can’t be other than honest, for the
gambling implement divides all its takings
and hqts no fund for purposes of bribery.
Besides, it is an inanimate machine, which
can’t go round buying support with money
in one hand, and a whisky breath and the
offer of an introduction to a ballet girl in
the other. Of course the opponents of the
tote may be honest, but on the other hand
they may have been “interviewed” on a
business basis by Isaac Shortodds. He has
the means for corruption, and he has also a
mighty strong reason to do all the corruption
he can. No opponent of the tote is above
suspicion so long as Isaac Shortodds is alive.

Once more the weekly paper starts in hope-
less pursuit of the one-week show. It is like
giving away a 300-yards start in a quarter-
mile dash; but still it has to be done in the
interests of Art and Literature and (pos-
sibly) Science. This time the flying show is
the last Lewis Waller production of “A Itoyal
Rival,” which jumped off at Sydney Royal
last Saturday night, and passes the post to-
morrow (Friday) evening, whereupon old
age overtakes it and it falls into the grave.
Ihe story of the “Kival” is the old familiar
one of the “Maritana” opera, and author
Gerald du Maurier has built his version
neatly round the brave, roystering, reckless,
tattered Don Caesar de Lazan, which con-
genial and attractive part is played gaily by
Waller. The English star’s light touch is
delightful in these so-called “romantic”
studies, where the dull bailiff Unreality is
waiting always at the wings to take posses-
sion at the first sign of solemnity or heavy-
footedness. Madge Marita Titheradge, the
winsome and ambitious gipsy singing girl of
the play, has something like a triumph in the
first scene,_ where she performs an exhilarat-
ing Spanish dance as few professional
dancers and no musical comedy prancer
could ever do it. It sets fire to the theatrical
premises, and the audience takes a long time
to cool off and cease demanding more. Re-
membering that fiery and stirring perform-
ance, one regrets Marita’s elevation to the
formal life of the Court and a sort of sombre
second-row seat in the plot. She is highly
decorative all the time, and plays cleverly
in a minor key until the last embrace. Frank
Woolfe, as Don Jose de Santarem, the schem-
ing villain of the piece, as usual alienates
the sympathy of all hands. This last villain
study is one of the best in his comprehensive
gallery. Charles Quartermaine provides an
intense _ and interesting study of a puppet
stage king obsessed by the usual lady; and
May Santon makes a pretty appeal for sym-
pathy as a very shapely and winsome Spam
ish lad. Alec F, Thompson and Marianne
Caldwell, as two attempted aristocrats, are
excellent in their grotesquely absurd parts.
The co. moves on to South Africa shortly.
“Come Over Here” still perspires to good
business at Her Majesty’s, Sydney. If it had
been better than it is, the people at the doors
might have had their feelings harrowed by
the sight of hundreds clamoring hopelessly
for admission, so perhaps it’s just as well it
is just what it is.

There are no signs yet that the most
barefaced “fake” in theatriealism ever offered
to Sydney folk is beginning to be found out,
since “Officer 660” has been on duty for
seven weeks at the Criterion.
At Sydney’s Little Theatre Pinero’s neat
comedy, “His House in Order,” is admirably
presented by a company whose chief excel-
lence is its all-round thoroughness. Every
woman who has married a widower is ad-
vised to take her husband.

Mr. Bruce Robertson, an Australian
artist, whose work has found representation
in the National (N.S.W.) Gallery, has
prepared a very interesting exhibition in
the form of an etching of the arrival of the
Commonwealth fleet in Sydney harbor last
year. The Australia appears in. the fore-
ground swinging slowly, with, as it seems,
a personal sense of dignified pride, to its
anchorage. To the many depictions of that
historical home-coming Mr. Robertson’s
etching is a conspicuous contribution. Fifty
copies are to be offered subscribers at £2 2s.
each, and precipitous application is neces-
sary.
The Aladdin panto, will come to the dead-
end to-morrow night: and on Saturday the
Sidney Adelphi will “come back” with “The
Pride of the Prairie,” a Mexican drama full
of gunpowder and cold spines.
At Sydney Tivoli this week, the Tom Davis
Trio of motor-cyclists provide a daredevilish
turn that, since it is liable to produce a crop
of amateur imitators, brings joy to the hearts
of local undertakers. Vivien Talleur and
Margaret Klos open up a stock of dainty
dances, ancient and modern; and Talleur
Andrews has transferred his voice from the
J.C.W. Co. to the Tiv., with a large amount
of success. Waterbury Bros, and Tenney
are responsible for a rather good musical
item, with some delightful incidental comedy ;
and the Two Bobs (another first-class rag-
time combination), Clemons and Dean
(songandance people), and J. Shields (a
clever imitator) complete the list of new-
comers. Selma Braatz, the lady juggler,
still causes the. world to wonder why she
doesn’t keep still; and various ragtimers,
who inflict their goods on a more or less
unwilling house, are recommended to mercy
on account of their youth.
The Fuller-Brennan programme at the
National Amphitheatre (Sydney) is becom-
ing more ambitious each week, and new and
important turns follow each other with
commendable rapidity. This is possible only
with an extensive circuit, and the manage-
ment is making the most of it. Even Syd-
ney Morning Herald has taken to serving
up boom notices of the Amphitheatre, for
the sole reason that the show deserves them.

Everybody in Sydney having now seen
“The Grafters,’’ at the Palace Theatre,
William Anderson, with that forethought for
the people’s entertainment which is one of
his most notable characteristics, announces
that on Saturday “The Speculators” will
be staged. This is another musical burlesque
from Alabama, or thereabouts, and Bert Le
Blanc is its prophet.
The White City still blooms its thousand
lights upon the voluptuous night in Rush-
cutter’s Bay, beside Sydney harbor, and nice,
white Australian girls and lovers frisk and
flirt and joy-ride upon the flying switchback
and glittering carossel where once a Chinese
market garden waved its turnip-top at the
stars and the lonely Pong wasted his un-
freshness upon the desert air. Calvert, “the
drunk on the high wire,” continues to be the
chief free entertainment, and his popularity
is likely to continue until he falls from his
altitude of 60ft. upon a 45-year-old girleen
belonging to any popular musical comedy in
town. After that the rush of press agent
on behalf of the more or less musical and
the somewhat comedy will obliterate every-
thing else on the sky-line.
Of the 305 days in the year there is one
in which the old unreliable maxim, “Charity
begins at home,” may be overlooked by the
closest-pursed citizen. That is on the day
when the actor seeks a helping hand for his
unfortunate brother. Morning, noon and
night the showman and the player are first
off the mark when “’ssistance is needed for
hospital or kindred relief. Once onlv during
the year the mummer mentions the fact that
his sick or needy brother is in existence, and

The Bulletin has misjudged the said citi-
zen. On Monday, at the White City (Syd-
ney), there will be a carnival in aid of the
benevolent and pension funds of the Actors’
Association of Australia, and £sofWis the
least that should be expected. The big show
will commence at 2 p.m. and will close at
midnight.
The pick of the bunch this week :
Crystal Palace : “A Silent Accuser,” showing the
disadvantages of being a third partv. An in-
ventor (moving-picture variety), wondering why his
girl doesn’t anyhow give him the glad eye, finds the
third party. Later, third party counted out.
Lyric f “Brothers at War,” an American Civil
War picture. Chief incident, the blowing up of a
railway line and bridge. Yankee newspaper reporter
sees, the blowing up. Result—another “Shocking
Railway Accident” in U.S.A.
Colonial : “The Beryl Coronet,” another of the
detective series taken under the eye of Conan Doyle.
Has absolutely no connection with the Victorian
police.
West's Glaciarium and Olympic: “A Prisoner
in the Harem,” introducing a fight between a lion
and a tiger, also between a man and a lioness.
Final results on application.
Empress: “A Shroud of Snow,” showing the
awful fate’ of the girl who waits for her long-lost
“bloke”—especially if he comes back again.
Lyceum: “A Message from Mars,” very well pro-
duced, and still drawing big houses.
Imperial: “In the Midst of the Jungle,” a thrill
in three spasms. Aided and abetted by a good aver-
age programme.
Adelaide Tivoli, which remains in the
open on the Oval, using the big new theatre
as well on Saturdays, is very strong on the
athletic side. The Sckmettans, the Clem-
endo§, the jumping Rose and Ellis, and the
Graus on their rod, pole or perch, form the
backbone of a good bill. The King’s is for
the moment strongest on the musical side,
with Bailey’s posing dogs as an extra. Fer-
nandez is a real musician, though mostly
content to fool with weird home-made in-
struments, and Ray Lawrence is about the
most ladylike and convincing of the recent
crop of singing female-impersonators. The
Dandies, Branscombe’s co., with Roland
Henry as chief humorist, have a big and
faithful following. The picture-houses—
West’s, Wondergraph, Pav., Empire, Star
and others —continue just as before ; and so
does the Royal, which is to say it remains
closed.
The only show that came new to Melbourne
last Saturday was Hawker’s Flight at Caul-
field racecourse. Hawker had previously
smashed all Australian records that this
writer can remember, save two —those of
Hart and another (he di'sremembers the
name of the other) —by travelling on his bi-
plane from Elsternwick to the lawn at
Government House and back again. Also
his airmanship had been noted on one or two
other occasions. On the strength of the
assurance that Hawker would rise to the oc-
casion in any ordinary sort of wind and
weather, a crowd of 25,000 expectant citi-
zens paid their money to see him nerform.
He put up a neat performance. Starting
from about the place where a Caulfield Cup
field is lined up, Hawker’s conveyance ran
on wheels 40yds. a-down the course ere it
rose from the ground ~n d amazed the multi-
tude. The effect of a flier in action is very
variable. As a rule one’s biassed view of
Hawker’s vehicle gives it the appearance
of a fish, or torpedo, with its chest resting
on one plane and its rudder end inclined
towards the upper plane. On Saturday, the
beautifully balanced ending to Hawker’s first
flight was the best sensation of all. The
machine circled downwards until it came
skimming over the same stretch of ground
from which it had started. At last it landed
on its wheels and ran itself to a standstill
in the centre of the course. Hawker, as he got
out and walked, was an apparently unflus-
tered aviator, wearing an engaging smile, a
cloth cap and a blue sac suit, cut baggy. To
anyone who saw the first productions of
“Milestones” the personality of the young
aviator is easily described. With another
couple of inches to his height he would be
the “dead ring” of Arthur Preece. the enthu-
siastic inventor, as impersonated by Herbert
Ford. liawker is a boy of 22. Ford, in his
character of the eager, ingenuous Preece,
looked very little older.
THE PANTO., AT HER MAJESTY'S,
MELBOURNE (Monkey Ballet).
Hawker made three flights last Saturday.
The second was a high soar, in which he
went over the course many times at a great
pace. This time the final whiz up the
straight ended unluckily. The machine landed
on its wheels, but swerved in towards the
rails, and bumped violently against a post
without hurting itself. Some of the crowd
that should not have been standing there
might have suffered contusions or sudden
deaths. However, all of the misolaced spec-
tators fell back out of harm’s way, except
one unfortunate who caught a whack on
the nose from one of the aeroplane’s tractor
blades. The third ascent was a homeward
.fly. Hawker took a charming lady passenger
into the airy structure, and together they

(nee Miss Davis), have opened as LADIES’ TAILORS
•and COSTUMIERS at Ocean House, Moore Street,
■Sydney.
Mr. Page, having held high Continental positions
:as the actual designer of ladies’ costumes, there will
•ensure a distinctiveness in every way equal to the
unost favored Continental styles.
Every costume will be a special study, which will
•quickly establish Mr. Page's name as a household
•word in ladies’ tailoring.
The fact of Mr. and Madam Page operating per-
sonally in the creation and construction of all details
■will present an economic advantage not possible of
■attainment by other fashionable houses, where the
•cost of a highly paid staff is charged always to
rthe customer.
This substantial saving should come as a welcome
•opportunity to all, particularly as every garment is
•exclusive in style and material, and bears the touch
•of a master hand. Note carefully the address:—

have been, and rather more. For one thing, it is a
less bulky volume than the 1913 Directory, although
it contains 100 more pages. Admirably printed on
thin paper, the Wise publication is one of the most
absolutely respectable and solidly useful books in

at Caulfield. Saturday was a fairly windy
day, but Hawker accented it as a very Rood
specimen, marred only by a few “blobs” in
the upper ether.
“The Lion and the Mouse," wherein
Julius Knight and co. fa rewelled Melbourne
last night (Wednesday). is a bad play
written years ago with a good American
purpose. Ti e purpose has lost its topical
interest, but the essential solemn foolishness
of the story was more glaringly apparent
last Saturday than when it came fresh to
this country. The fact that most of the
principals were uncertain in their lines
THE PANTO., AT HER MAJESTY'S,

didn’t tend to make the performance con-
vincing. Even Julius Knight, as the allegedly
iron-liearted millionaire who acts like a vain
old ass with an autobiography in view, had
seemingly forgotten some of his cues, and
lost the run of his previous conception of
the part. Nevertheless the audience took
kindly to the first three acts of “The Lien
and the Mouse.” Audiences consist largely
of girl these times, and this entertainment
consists mainly of a girl defeating the com-
bined forces of an unscrupulous plutocracy
and a corrupt legislature. The heroine, orig-
inally played here by Miss Katherine Grey,
is an easy winner all the way. Miss Browne
has the grateful task of reducing the bloated
capitalist to limpness in this revival. She
performs it vigorously and picturesquely.
Whereas Miss Grey of yore always wore a
feeble coat and skirt, and kept her hands in
her side pockets, Miss Browne is a dream
of drapery and an otherwise impressive young
person. Therefore when she tells the multi-
millionaire what kind of a person he is and
how she intends to play h —l at Washington
rather than see her father further sat upon,
the audience cheers her as she never was
cheered before, and the deplorable weakness
of the last act doesn’t matter much.
Melb. Royal will lie closed to outsiders on
Thursday and Friday nights what time
“Joseph and His Brethren” is being finally
rehearsed for production on Saturday.
Scenery, pageantry and all the other things
that go to make a Biblical play as gorgeous
as a panto are said to be laid on to “Joseph
and His Brethren” regardless of expense.
Also the Temptation scene is featured in the
advt. Speaking from long experience of
dramatic lessons for Bible students, this pub-
lication would say that a red-hot lemptation
scene is b“ t the thing to attract the godly
and the ungodly alike.
At Melbourne King's there will be no more
“Land of Nod” after Friday, the 20 th. The
humor of that strange fantasy continues to
be mostly lost, stolen or mislaid; but the
songs and choruses have kept it going for
more than GO performances up to now, and
the last week is still to go.
The Williamson management states that
“The Forty Thieves.” in its eighth week of
Melbourne popularity, is “booming bigger
than ever.” If the late George Washington
were employed in the sale of early-door tic-
kets he would swear an "ffidavit to the same
effect. The panto, business never slackens.
“J. Disliragge”: The long wash-up of a
Maryannless home threatened to come to an
end last week, when a yellow-haired siren
from a registry office drifted along to see if
we would suit her as employers. She took
the best chair calmly and without invitation
and began to cross-examine Mrs. Dishragge.
When she had been informed how many we
were in family, how many minutes the
assisting sister-in-law would linger on the
premises after she took it over, what time I
came home and left, how old the little fellow
was, and about a dozen other things, she
cleared her two yards of powdered throat
and moaned, “Oh, I’m afraid the place
wouldn’t suit me at all! I can’t hear chil-
dren !” Then uprose the proud and furious
mother and, not meaning it that way at all,
floored the disdainful invader with: “No!
you don’t look the sort of girl that could!”
I am informed that three imitation pearl
buttons flew off the hysterical siren’s back
as she fell from the premises. No matter how
yellow a siren may be. she hates to think
she couldn’t if she wanted to.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Milford Haven (that was his professional name;
Ije was William E. Weaver in private life) died in
Sydney ■ Hospital on the 2nd. He was the only son
df Captain Weaver, of London, and started his pro-
fessional career in Australia a quarter of a century
back with the, Williamson Opera Company. After-
wards he spent seven years on Harry Rickards’ cir-
cuits. His remain^ 1 were’put to rest at Waverley.
“Moana”: After all, the whoop made by the
Noo Yark Anti-White Slave Society, and the general
fuss, and the yards of cablecrams about the affair,
and the alleged lengthy conference of the alleged Im-
migration Officers, and the miles of interviews in the
(N.Y. papers, and the general hue and cry, it tran-
spires that the spectacular arrest of Marie Lloyd
and her best jockey boy, Bernard Dillon, some time
back in Uncle Samland was nothing more serious
than a cleverly planned and excellently staged adver-
tisement for Marie, engineered by her American press
agent! It takes its place in theatrical history along-
side the Big Hat Prosecution a year or two back in
Fogtown, and next door to the famous story circu-
lated about a celebrated actress some time ago
describing how she caught a whale in the Gulf of
Mexico with a rod and line!

The new British Copyright Act seems to be loaded
with trouble for theatrical managers. Hitherto man-
agers have stood on velvet when dealing with
authors who submitted manuscript plays. Now the
miserable author has some rights of his or her
own. In London Miss Rosemary Rees, a Maoriland
girl, recently sued Walter and Frederick Melville, of
the New Prince’s Theatre on a charge of having lifted
portion of a play she submitted them under the
title of “The Beggar Bride.” The Melvilles rejected
Miss Rees’s play, but shortly afterwards produced a
new creation which they called “A Beggar Girl’s Wed-
ding.” Miss Rees declared that it was mostly her play
under another name, and started legal proceedings.
Two well-known playwrights swore that the plot of “A
Beggar Girl’s Wedding” was identical with that of
“The Beggar Bride.” Verdict went for de-
fendants. A Sydney case, based on similar
allegations, hasn’t got into full blast yet, but the
foundation-stone was laid last week, and the com-
pleted structure is expected to blossom forth and be
steaming at high pressure very shortly—in a manner
of speaking.
If the second or third re-arrival of Allan Doone,
with a well-worn budget of feeble broguey dramas, is
“Glorious News for the Irish,” the forthcoming first
visit of Harry Lauder might be expected to count as
“Bonnie Tidings for the Scawtch.” Lauder is the
chap who introduced anew and genial form of Sandy
to the music-hall stage—a merry, bonnie Sandy in
place of the dour, bony ditto of yore. But as busi-
ness propositions for Australia the difference between
Lauder and Doone is the difference between perfervid
Irish belief in things Hibernian and sober Scottish
faith in things Caledonian. One is reminded of the
proverb, “Scotchmen drink Scotch whisky because it
is the best; Irishmen drink Irish whisky because it
is Irish.” Even the McTavishes will judge Lauder
on his merits in a great measure. The Mikes have
swallowed Doone as a shark swallows a bit of sail
cloth.
“Have you heard of any possible engagements ?
I am so anxious to get on. I hope you will put in
a word for me whenever you can.” So Nellie Arm-
strong wrote to Wilhelm Ganz, an influential London
conductor, composer and pianist, in 1886; and
Nellie Melba will probably thank him very pro-
fusely for including her early appeal in his recently
published autobiography. She had taken a letter of
introduction from someone in Melbourne to Ganz.
At the first hearing he recognised that she had an
uncommonly good voice, and he promptly communi-
cated the fact to his friend Carl Rosa. Rosa said
he would make an appointment to hear her, but he
forgot all about it—and that was how Nellie Arm-
strong came to drop Ganz the quoted reminder.
Albert Cohen (“Call Boy”), of the Dunedin (M.L.)
Star, is giving up his theatrical work on the paper
after a solid 20 years at it. He has been one of the
most popular show critics in a country where there
are practically no critics. Asa matter of hard fact
it was his personality that made his popularity,
although, as far as really and truly theatrical news
(not press agent’s news), went Cohen was well out of
the ruck, just as he was, for so many years, in re-
gard to political news before he took over the sub-
editorial chair of the Star. When he left the M.L.
Parliamentary press gallery, the Ministers (it was in
Richard Seddon’s time) handed him a service of
silver plate in sheer thankfulness. They reckoned
that, with Cohen off the track, they could secrete a
piece of useful political information until the time
was ripe.
The old hands are beginning to shake their heads
and remark sadly that the Stage is not what it used
to be. There was a time when it had its own
peculiar style of garb, largely red and yellow, for
street wear, allowed its hair to grow long, and had
its own code of morals and ethics. Also, the stage-
manager was expected to have a pungent wit and
a fine flow of descriptive language. The Stage has
g'one to the Devil. Not one actor in a hundred now
dresses differently from the other man in the street;
not one in 200 wears his hair long; and his morals
arc no worse than, and no better than, and no
different from those of the vulgar mob. Also, the
glory of the stage-manager’s eloquence has departed;
and he is no longer allowed to tear the atmosphere
asunder while addressing Miss Snevellici, and Miss
Bravura, and Mrs. Gruddei), and the Infant Phenom-
enon. One recent young lady who thought that a
Melbourne stage-manager had not been quite polite
served blue paper on the staggered king, haling him
before the City Court op a charge of using “insult-
ing words.” But when the time came the lady did
not appear, and the affair blew over. Possibly Vin-
cent Crummies had abased himself and eaten his
hat at the lady’s feet by way of reparation.
The following is alleged to be Ethel Warwick’s re-
ply to the question, “Are you delighted to be back in
Australia?”: “You can bet your life I am. All of
us are glad to get back to Australia. All over Lon-
don you meet artists who are longing to return, and
who Warmly congratulate one and wring one’s hands
when they hear that you are. going back to the land
of sunshine and hospitality. Why, you cannot get
away from the fact that we all have a glorious time
here. In London, you know, there are so many people,
and so many actors and actresses,, that one is com-
paratively a mere detail in that huge whirlpool. In
Australia the limelight of publicity on the people of
the profession is a million candle-power, and we are
kept in view all the time. We are made a fuss of
and feted and talked about, while the warming spirit
of hospitality is all the time being poured on us.
Personally, I love it. To me it is the wine of life,
and I make no secret ,of the fact that I love, atten-
tion, adulation and appreciation. Yes, indeed, Aus-
tralia is the artists’ paradise.” The moral of the
lady’s frank confession would make the rabid mum-
mer-worshippers of this country feel uncommonly
small if they were capable of taking it to heart.
“Circle”: Death stilled one of the loudest voices
in Vaudeville, when it dropped the chocolate-colored
Irving Sayles, at Christchurch (M.L.) last' week.
Unlike the bogus and gloomy white' minstrels who
were common in (he business when he was at his best,
poor Sayles always enjoyed his own uproar, and to
many work-wearied people his childish delight in
mere noise was infectious. He was a neat-iooking
colored pusson, particularly about the head, which
never seemed to grow any hair and apparently was
merely there to finish him off and contain that
smooth, gleaming battery of teeth. When Sayles
opened his neat head it was like lifting the lid of a
brown pill-box; and when the preliminary roars and
howls streamed out from between his lips, the listen-
ing patron was apt to imagine himself at the mouth
of a cave in which a lion and a hyena were having a
wild duet. In his later days Sayles got his simple
living by. his uproar, his teeth-exhibitions, shuffling,
cackles and neat double-somersaults—the last reluc-
tantly performed only after much persistent stamping
and whistling by the gallery folk. He only really
failed to hold the house when he allowed his humor-
ous brown countenance to become drawn and sad
and tried to sing seriously and huskily of his “baby”
or his “honey” with the remnants of the voice he had
cheerfully ruined. He hailed from somewhere in the
Southern United States, and commenced here as a
youth way back in the ’Bo’s with the Hicks and
Sawyer minstrels, to which troupe his partner, Charlie
Pope, also belonged. Most of the subsequent years
were spent at the top of his voice on the Harry Rickards
paysheet, but he finished up in M.L. as a Fuller
artist. The quiet of Eternity will be seriously threat-
ened if he has been allowed to take his howl across
the Jordan.
Walter Melville, the prosperous bellow-
dramatist, is refreshingly frank on the
subject of his “art” and his practice
thereof. Giving evidence re the charge
of plagiarism brought by Miss Rees, of
Maoriland, he stated that his “original
melodrama” which he was said to have
borrowed from the lady’s manuscript
“contained stock incidents and conven-
tional. characters.” He was not aware of
the existence of Miss Rees’ play when he
was writing it. He dictated it in less
than a week. Playwriting came very easy
to him. His only difficulty was to find
euphonious names for the characters.”
No intelligent person who has considered
Melville’s bellowdramas in all their naked
foolishness can doubt that he finds play-
writing easy. If they were printed for public cir-
culation they would testify to the truth of Douglas
Jerrold’s dictum, that “easy writing is d —d hard
reading.’’
A Poverty-pointer, talking of plagiarism in the
vaudeville business, said: “Bert Levy, for example,
began drawing to gags and music, on a contrivance
which reflected his work in a magnified form on a
screen. There must be dozens of shameless stealers
of his idea operating in different parts of the world
at the present time.” But as regards the contrivance
aforesaid, The Bulletin’s old friend George Brew-
ster, the Melbourne photographer, writes: “Bert
Levy, as we all know, got the idea from Alex. Laing,
who used it here when he introduced the Pansy Mon-
tague ‘Milo’ turn at the Opera House. Laing had
adopted it from Jocksie Sutherland, the inventor of
the submarine merry-go-round, the target cinema-
tographer, etc., etc. Twenty-five years ago I sold
the same idea to Pain’s Fireworks, for the production
of fire portraits. Pain’s did not use it much, owing
to the chap they put to work it not being quick
enough to get good effect. Where I got the dodge
you can’t expect me to remember after all these
years.”
“Jean S.”: Actor Jimmy Atholwood is the possessor
of an old circus-trick dog which is of such patient
bearing that it listens to Jimmy’s views on Hamlet
without ever answering back. Lately he took his
pet to Her Majesty’s, where a couple of miscreants,
mistaken for comedians, inveigled the beast into
the paint shop and gave it a coat of divers colors.
When Atholwood subsequently discovered that the
post-impressionist tiger he met was his own Fido in
disguise, it seemed as if nothing but the instant
shedding of blood would appease his wounded feel-
ings. A few days later Fido, washed and restored
to his former self, got into trouble on his own
account. The faithful hound accompanied his master
on a visit to Gregan McMahon, and while the
tragedian was talking with' Mac, the dog started
browsing on some plays that were lying around.
When torn from his repast Fido had practically con-
sumed a masterpiece, and Atholwood was terribly
distressed. “My Heavens, Mac,” he said, “the dog
has swallowed your play!” Mac, however, held that
the brute was more to be admired than blamed,
having succeeded in doing what no audience had
accomplished up to now.
Something new in the way of a record was recently
achieved in Berlin by Emmy Destinn, the prima
donna, when she collected £2500 from a flickergraph-
film company for singing a single aria from “Mig-
non” in the cage of a hungry lion, what time anxious
operators made a flick record of the show and frantic
individuals armed with coal-scuttles and other artil-
lery hovered about oh the outskirts ready to slay the
lion on the slightest provocation. The act lasted
five minutes, so Emmy was rewarded to the tune of
£SOO per minute, if rumor isn’t the usual old liar.
In addition to this, the film co. had to insure the
plump singer for £25,000 against death or injury.
As the patrons of the world’s flicker shows, who are
to be thrilled by this film, won’t hear Destinn’? voice,
it seems difficult to understand just why the co. parted
with so much good cash. Surely it could have hired
any female lion-tamer for about 11s. 4d., and rushed
her into the part? She could have sung any old
thing, and it would have been much cheaper and
much more effective, especially if the lion had become
infuriated at the lack of tune and had eaten her.
From London: The Daily Telegraph, reviewing
the drama in 1913, says that most of the English
leaders of the craft have “observed, an . obstinate and
disheartening silence,” whilst the few who have
spoken in plays have said nothing of any account.
The year’s laurels are awarded to Arnold Bennett,
whose “Great Adventure” has passed its 300th night
at the Kingsway, and is still going strong. .T. M.
Barrie has lost ground considerably. His “Adored
One” is dismissed as a “farrago of inconceivable in-
cidents,” while his “Half an Hour” “yielded hardly
any better results on close analysis.” He did a little
less badly in “The Will,” but the idea was transpar-
ently borrowed or stolen from “Milestones.” Bernard
Shaw is also on the down grade, his “Androcles and
the Lion” and “Great Catherine” proving “positively
tedious.” Beerbohm Tree’s Biblical “Joseph and His
Brethren” is summed up as a signal and well-
deserved success—“strongly melodramatic and splen-
didly spectacular, but with little religious signifi-
cance.”
“Petramos”: I saw it in the contract made
between the said artist and the said manager for a
country tour: “And it is hereby agreed between the
said manager and the said artist that the said artist,
when called upon to wear evening-dress, shall at all
times abstain from the substance known as celluloid
either for cuffs, collars or shirt-fronts, on pain of
summary dismissal.”
“J.P.”: The first benefit performance given in
Australia was at Sydney on February 4, 1796, when
convicts produced a comedy in the first theatre built
in Sydney (opened three weeks previously) in aid of
a soldier’s widow. In flour, kangaroo flesh and rum
£l2 was realised.
“A.G.R.” (from Britain) : AVhy don’t Australian
singers coming to London break new ground in
choosing their professional names, if they rmist have
such things, instead of following Melba, like so many
sheep? Here are a few samples to date: “Tasma”
Moore, “Sydna” Clark, “Mademoiselle Zelandia,”
“Mademoiselle Ballara,” “Mademoiselle Adela,”
“Madame Elsa Stralia.” The list will not be com-
plete until we have Fraulein Woollomoolooser and
Signorina Alice Springski. And why all this made-
moiselling? It isn’t worth tuppence.. Ada Crosslev
resolved to do without such frills, and has become
just about the foremost concert artist in London.
“Y.Z.” : Not all school teachers have sense,
but here and there a wisehead appears among
them. I have sincere respect for the astute-
ness of the young man who sent this letter to
our wash lady: “Dear Madam. I cannot hope
to teach your boy anything while you persist
in dressing him in sawed-off old pairs of his
father’s pants. llow can you expect a boy
to learn arithmetic, grammar and geography
if he has always a pair of trousers on his
mind?”
Every now and then some large, vague
assertion that has about as little foundation
as a balloon floats into notice. The Aus-
tralian Review of Reviews, which seems to
be handicapped mentally by the peaceful
HIGH TREASON.
BOTH (in a hoarse whisper): “ Socialist!!”
opinions of the late W. T. Stead, sent up
this globule of gas in its issue of 12/1/’l4: —
Nowadays every sane person admits' that we are
in no danger whatever from a Japanese invasion, but
that bogey was used so effectively a few years ago
that we are to-day compelling all our lads to train
in arms, and are spending millions where formerly we
were content to spend thousands on military prepara-
tion.
Well, suppose for the sake of argument that
the Review of Reviews (it really should be
be the Retreat of Retreats) is right in its;
tremendous assertion, and that Australia is
in no danger of a Japanese invasion. Is that
any reason for disarming? England used to
be afraid of France, but it didn’t scrap its
navy and its collective gun when it became
good friends with the people across the Chan-
nel ; it was old enough to know that there
were plenty of other potential enemies
around. Later on, it was very bad friends
with Russia ; but when it shook hands with
Russia, it still kept its gun, because it had
found a new enemy in Germany. Guns and
armies and navies are generally accumulated
and kept handy on account of one particular
foe; but thev are intended for any old
enemy that happens along out of the shifting
riot of history. No rich man or nation ever
lacked enemies, and anyhow it is a manly
thing to have a gun in the houfte. We may
all lay down our arms when We get to
Heaven; but there is no certainty about it.
The way the self-elected saints fage together
on earth seems to show that, the real peace-
lover will have to wear an Automatic gud in
his hip-pocket if he wants to spend a tran-
quil eternity.

they did they were delighted, and are now very proud
of her. —Melbourne weekly.

SOCIETY
An Adelaide man has pot six months -for
being in love. It affected him vocally—Like
a cat. He insisted on standing outside the
Beloved One’s house at night, and making
loud noises, amorous and otherwise; and she
and the neighbors disliked it ,about equally,
aad signified the same in the usual manner.
A cat’s language when cold water is thrown
on it can’t be understood, fortunately, but
his could ; also the stones which he bounced
on their roofs as a practical retort were un-
mistakable. The lady tried to discourage
him by once getting him sent up for a tort-
night. But it was no good so now he has
<;he longer term, during which one or two
doctors are to have a look at him.
“Cebes”: Re “Nestor’s” remarks on the
“Toll of the Surf” (B. 29/1 /’l4). “Nestor”
wants a surf-boat on every beach to save life
and keep people inside the breaker line.
Now, I, who am in the surf every day of the
week, consider that I know something about
if, and declare that “Nestor” is talking
through his hat. For the following reasons:
(1) On the metropolitan beaches there are people
bathing from 4.30 in the morning till 7.30 at night.
On Saturdays and Sundays you have to walk over
the mob inshore to get into deep water; conse-
quently at least two boats would be required to
“patrol” each of the bigger beaches. In all, that
would mean about a dozen boats, with crews. Now,
who’s going to pay?
(2) The breaker line at Bondi after a good south-
erly is out near the point somewhere, and the
breakers are as high as a house. Notwithstanding
that, there’s always somebody bathing, and a man
could get drowned 20 times in as many seconds if he
were 50yds. from shore, where the surf boat couldn’t
float, but a man with a belt and a line can. It has
been done.
(3) “Nestor” forgets that for every life lost, there
are probably at least 50 saved by the surf clubs,
which also stop bathers from taking foolish risks.
Further, where would a surf boat have been in the
recent fatality at Cronulla, or the two-year-old sen-
sation at Coogee? Both those occurred close to the
shore, and certainly not beyond the breaker line. It
is on such occasions that surf clubs are particularly
useful.
(4) “Nestor” has evidently been to the Con-
tinong” : but, from what 1 have heard, and photo-
graphs I have seen, there is no comparison to be
made between Australian surfing and Continental
bathing. The Continental waves are ripples, which
appear to break right on the beach.
Wherefore I adjure “Nestor” to really find
out something about surfing; and when he
has done it, he will pat the surf clubs on the
back, instead of damning them with faint
praise.
“Demos” hands in his regrets
Success has had its usual influence on the Labor
movement, and the effect is displayed in the degen-
eracy of the N. S. Wales conference. There is not
half the 1 real earnesttiess and genuine work shown as
in the poor days of Labor when the mostly unpaid
delegates could not afford to let conference last more
than three or four days, and were remarkably brief
in stating their convictions. Nowadays, a great
deal of the time of conference is occupied in talking
to the gallery (the gallery being the Government) by
aspiring l billet-hunters. When the real, dyed-in-the-
wool Laborite gets up' to ask why the Government
has destroyed plank after plank of the platform,
Bloggs and Biffkins, who are candidates for M.L.C.-
ships, Boshter, who is after a job as an Industrial
inspedtof, and Blank, who has another axe to grind,
leap eagerly to their feet in a desire to defend the
Government. They are prepared to abrogate any
Labor principle, in order to show their prospective
employers their fitness for the job they are after;
and the woods are full of them. So, as a matter of
fact, are the straight-wire Laborites, but they can’t
get rid of them. It is the presence of these time-
servers which has spoilt the honesty and plain direct-
ness of the old-time movement, weakened its solid-
ity, and given Holman and his pals courage to take
liberties- with the platform which formerly would
have unhitched an earthquake.

Canberra’s first organ of public opinion -
i.c., the pioneer issue of the Journal of
the Royal Military College of Aus-
tralia —is a reminder that the Military
Defence system is springing up more rapidly
than the Federal Capital. The temporary
College at Duntroon, which is a boundary
mark of where Canberra city is going to be,
was opened in a half-finished state some 30
months ago, and the
students were under

of the wings of Dun-

On the other hand there was this one in the
Sydney papers a fortnight ago:—
FOR SALE.—Motor Car. Very cheap. Or would
exchange for two mules.
In quite an incidental way attention has
been called anew to the rapacity of that
chartered old cormorant, the Melb. Met.
Tramway Cos., and the culpability of the
Tory Government of old which granted the
charter. The tramcar letter-box system is
about to make its first appearance in laggard
Melbourne on a municipal electric line. The
Malvern Tramways Trust has. graciously
consented to carry letter-boxes in
running between Deepdene and St. Kilda.
Even this had to be “arranged” by P.M.G.
Agar Wynne, though the Government should
obviously have been in a position to put let-
ter-boxes in the cars as a matter of course,
for the convenience of the public. And now
that Melbourne is about to get, in one sub-
urban district only, the benefit of a system
that is not new to Australia, the Postal
Department has explained why it was not
introduced long since on the metropolitan
cable lines. Why .? Because the precious Tram-
way Cos. directors demanded unreasonable
terms for the “concession.” Private Enternrise
stated its terms and told the Government
that it could take ’em or leave ’em. Private
Enterprise, having obtained a monopoly of
the right to supply public tramway service
wherever it chose to operate, would
see public convenience d —d before it
would do aught to oblige the Government.
“Melb”: Wednesday (4th) was a fear-
fully hot day, with terrific north wind. Yet
no fruit was allowed to be sold, by Parlia-
mentary edict, in consequence of the fruit-
erers’ picnic. Now the grapes, pears, plums,
peaches and tomatoes refused to stop rotting
by Act of Parliament. About 25.000 cases
come into Melbourne’s Western Market
every Wednesday. Mildura grapes had to
be sacrificed at 2s. the case. Tomatoes worth
45.. 6d. went for 2s. 6d. Pears were down
2s. a case. It was cruelty both for growers
and eaters, who cannot stuff, two days’ tucker
into one. Heaps of frifit went bad, and
heaps of people ate corned beef when some-
thing else would have done them a lot more
good. Let us crowd all these picnics into a
series and be done with it. Monday, fruit-
erers’ picnic (no fruit or vegetables) ; Tues-
day, beef and fish picnic (no beef or fish) ;
Wednesday, milk and grocery picnic (no
milk, butter, sugar, tea, etc.) ; Thursday,

darkness and beer in the evening) ; Friday,

paid, the cashier being at a dance up the

preachers’ picnic, including archbishops.
MISTER BROWN; A MIXED ODE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The London Quaker deputationist, Mr. Alfred 11.
Brown, believes that the Commonwealth has no need
to resort to arms to defend itself.
In the course of an interview shortly after his
arrival in Sydney, he gave the following illustration
of the Quaker policy of defence: —
“You sometimes see a boy putting up his fists to
hit another boy. But the other boy makes no move-
ment. ITe only smiles. There is no fight. The
bellicose bov becomes ashamed of himself.”
In a word, the Quakers act on the proverb, “It
takes two to make a fight.”
As a result of his investigations in the Northern
Territory, Mr. Brown has come to the conclusion
that it can never be permanently settled by a white
race on account of the climate. — Sydney Telegraph.
Oh, have you heard of Mister Brown,
Who’s lately come to Sydney Town?
His views have all been taken down —
They’re very interesting!
He is a mighty Man of Peace,
Who prophesies that War must cease:
Though men will murder, rob and fleece,
Brown says they’re only jesting!
Brown says (see D.T. interview)
That just to make a fight takes two —
Which means, “Hit me. , and I’ll hit you!”
Such conduct Brown chides strongly ;
But, how about a fight of Three,
Say, you and Robinson —and me?
If Brown thinks fights like that can’t be,
I guess he’s guessing wrongly !
And how about a fight of Four?
(For details, see last Balkans War)
Or five, or six, or even more,
When thrones are badly shaken ?. ...
Good Mister Brown is far ahead
Of times like these ; he’s angel-bred !
But let’s be merciful instead,
And say that he’s mistaken.
Yet, hark ! an unfamiliar noise—
A sweet, mild, bleating voice that cloys
’Tis Mister Brown describing boys—-
The meek, good boys he dotes on ;
The Little Willie of “East Lynne,”
Paul Dombev, Eric and their kin—
All “interesting,” pale and thin —- .
. The kind C. Garbage bloats on !
So good is Mister Brown’s Good Boy
He will not yell, swear or annoy,
Or break his infant sister’s toy
By hammering, or filing;
While as for fighting others —No!
He will not give, or guard, a blow,
But in a gentle Quaker glow
He smiles—and keeps on smiling!
And Mister Brown declares that smiles
Are safer far, by miles and miles,
Than weapons, and vain warlike wiles,
And methods of effront’ry
To keep all foemen far away ;
While boys who can both smile and pray
Are sure to save Australi-a
Or any other country !
But Mister Brown, alas! deplores
The climate of our Northern shores,
Because the hoys that he adores
On them can never settle ;
lie’s never lived there, true; but knows
Intuitively, I suppose—
The only breed of Boy it grows
Is black as any kettle!
Hence, Mister Brown instructs us all
That poor Australia will fall.
Like Jericho’s thrice-famous wall
Before the Hebrew shakers,

From an Australian in London: —
Every tune 1 see a cadging Australian appeal in
England it hurts me, and I feel that it misrepresents
and belittles Australia. The latest to send round
Ih'’ hat is the Bush Book Club, of Phillip-street, Syd-
ney, whose cry goes up in the London papers. Accord-
ing to the two philanthropic ladies whose names are to
it, the club provides books for the bookless in the
backblocks; and here is the list of people who are
to benefit from the circulation of the hat in Eng-
land : “Settlers, schoolmasters, storekeepers, shearers,
sleeper-cutters and station-hands, with their wives
and families.” With the ladies’ fondness for the
letter “s,” why did they leave out swaggies and
sundowners? But do our backblock settlers, school-
masters, storekeepers and all the other s’s really
•desire to get their literature through English charity?
It would be a libel on their independence to say so.
There may be individual cases in which gift books
would be welcome, b.ut the ladies don’t say that —
ikey generalise in wholesale fashion. The classes
they mention are well able to get their literature
through local booksellers, and to pay for it. With a
view to stimulating the flow of English coin into the
hat, the club descants on the woes of the bookless
in the backblocks. They know a young governess
who was unlucky enough to get a billet in a house
without a book in it. “After a year of mental
starvation, she gave up her situation and returned
to Sydney, defeated by the conditions obtaining in the
home of her employers.” And, presumably, she made
straight for the public library—or was it the Tivoli
or the Royal ? The British charitable public is
assured that “far away on the Lachlan River and
up north on the Queensland border the people greet
the advent of the coach which brings them books
with unbounded delight and satisfaction.” At Barrin-
gun, the “arrival .of the first consignment of books,
was made the cause of public rejoicing, and a letter
pathetic in its overflowing gratitude was sent to the
president.” Yet Barringun, though it has only 87
people, and is nearly 600 miles from Sydney, has
two mails per week, and the mail-coach comes from
the adjacent town of Bourke, where literature is
quite procurable. “Books,” they add, “are a distrac-
tion, a comfort, and a source of information and
education. They make people think and give them
something to talk about, and they keep men away
from the nearest store where drink is sold”—a nice
little bit of bait this for Exeter Hall, always the
most easily “worked” section of English society.
By the way, when did the outback Australian start
drinking at the “store?” Where has the good old
put got to?

“We look forward with much pleasurable
expectation to Lady Helen Munro-Fereruson’s
presence among us,”* said S. M. Herald
last Monday in a leader on the new Gover-
nor-General. It was a remark quite in the
style of the old Carrington days, when
Governor’s wives had to wear blotting
paper on their chests by reason of the im-
passioned weeping of the Very Best People
thereupon.
CHECKMATE.
HIM: “I won't allow you to break off the en-
gagement.”
HER: "Then I won't allow you to marry me.
The man who will not consider his
fiancle's wishes is not likely to consider his
wife’s."
An eager Jeames telegram from Perth to
the Sydney Telegraph related that Earl
Grey disputed with Governor ’Arry Barron
(at lunch) which was the younger, and said,
“I’ll bet him a dollar he’s a younger man
than I.” Probably the bet was made; but a
dollar? Oh, no. The bet was “faive shil-
lings,” surely.
The blessed Knights of Tythias organisa-
tion, which got f start in ' Melbourne the
other week (and is going to supply in the
other States the unfelt want which the
Masons, Oddfellows, Foresters, Druids and
sich have not dealt with), will celebrate its
50th birthday this month. The Knights are
not a benefit, or provident, or mutual
burying society, and are
not as financially
strong as the Masons,
of course. But they
claim to be numeri-
cally stronger than the
aproned brethren. A
Yankee bloke by the
name of Justice H.
Bathbone was the
founder in 1864. As a
school teacher he be-
came bitten with the
Damon and Pythias
legend, and when he
got a billet at Wash-
ington his idea was to
confine his brotherly
love cult to the U.S.
Education Depart-
ment. Then, as the
ritual caught on, and
outsiders were taken
into Bathbone’s secret
order of Knights, it
was decided to give
, Canada a chance.
After which the move-
ment was extended to
the Philippines, and
now it has reached
Australia. Knight
Brown seemingly is
charged with the job
of planting the gospel
of Pythias hereabouts.
The distinctive charm
of the Order, says
Brown, lies in the
fact that the form of
installation differs for
each novice. No two
Knights are cut on
exactly the same
pattern. But they all
have to ante up the
same installation fee C£3), and the yearly
subscription will be thirty bob in every
case.
The thrifty ways of the Education' De-
partment of Victoria would be amusing if
they weren’t so disastrous. Just at present
those citizens of Crib Point who possess
youngsters of school age are “on strike,” and
though the school and a teacher are present
there are no scholars. For some mysterious
reason the Department seems to have its
knife into Crib Point. Perhaps it dislikes the
name of the place. No permanent teacher
has yet been appointed, though there are 64
scholars. The last 12 months witnessed no
fewer than five different temporary appoint-
ments. During the recent Christmas holidays
the Department got the idea that the Crib
Point scholars were revelling in too much
A MATTER OF TIME.
ABE: “Mine crikey you vos dirly, I key."
I kEY: “Vell! I vos oldter den you, Abe."
luxury, so it removed the sanitary conveni-
ences to a new school at Shoreham, 10 miles
away, and left Crib Point without any.
This was the end of the long lane that had
no turning, and the father of the wise child
that is said to be acquainted with its own
parent decided to keep his offspring at home
till the Ministry became civilised.
Last week the Victorian Full Court con-
firmed the decision of the local Church of
England Synod to give women the right to
vote at the election of lay members of the
Synod aforesaid. The odd thing was that
any man should have appealed against this
decision. Women are the backbone of all re-
ligious denominations, but ’"ore especially of
the C. of E. sect. They supply about 85 per
cent, of the congregations. They constitute
about 95 per cent, of all the church societies,
including “mothers’ meetings,” the other 5
per cent, being composed of parsons and war-
dens. They do pretty well everything in the
way of visible church work (outside of the
pulpit) except passing round the plate. And
why the taking-up of collections in the taber-
nacle is not performed by dimpled girls,
rather than by wrinkled old women in
trousers, even Mark Antony forgot to men-
tion when he held forth over the dead body
of Caesar, and the great Greek philosopher
Dogsneeze, who lived in a tub, couldn’t have
explained. Of course women should have
votes for the election of lay members of the
blessed Synod. The hens should themselves
be the lay members thereof, not the roosters.
The air of Melbourne is thick with stories
of the man who hires a taxi from the garage
by telephone, in a false name, and ultimately
escapes without paying for the hire. When
he hasn’t worked the false name dodge (some-
times he humorously tells them to charge the
joy-ride to a well-known Wowser) or laid
his plans neatly, he is carried back to the
garage and is tied to a post when he con-
fesses his impecuniosity. After which he is
hosed by order of the taxi-autocrat until he is
nearly as damp as the proverbial drowned
rat.. Some day a captured joy-rider will die
under the hose treatment, and then there will
be an inquiry into the question why taxi-cab
frauds are so much more common than han-
som cab frauds of yore. The explanation, of
course, is in the scandalous maintenance of
the high cost of taxi riding by giving the gar-
ages a monopoly of the trade. If nn»for-cafi>
ranks were placed at the convenience of the
public by municipal order, and tb.e terms,
were cash on delivery of the fare at his des;-
tination, as with the old hansom and fouir-
wheelers, the would-be bilker would have to
scheme darned artfully to get away without
paying for carriage. Under the existing sys-
tem fraud is invited, and the bloated bosses
are charging what they like, and hosing with
impunity any bad debtors who get caught.

“Weary Sub-editor”: There is variety in
social reporting in China. Some of the
Yellow Agony were lately indulging in their
version of “a quiet but pretty wedding”
when pirates fell down on the function, cut
the throats of 22 guests and captured 20
more —probably the best-looking and most
stylishly-dressed girls. Then the wedding
was no longer quiet or pretty, but a real
vivid news item with some print val e. Our
social life needs an infusion of piracy to
brighten it up. My job would be a joy
again if only I could write, “A quiet but:
pretty murder yesterday occurred at Belle-
vue Hill. The bride-elect went away with a
pirate wearing an axe, while the head of
the bridegroom was thrown into the back
yard. The presents were numerous and
costly, including a cruet and two dead
bodies. The wedding breakfast, which was
upset and trodden on during the disturbance*
was supplied by our esteemed fellow-towns>
man, Mr. Jonah Ketch.”

Courtship is becoming a strenuous busi-
ness. At the inquiry into the death of
Elizabeth Johnson, whose throat was al-
legedly cut by her lover at Windsor, near
Brisbane, it transpired that Borneo carried
a revolver and razor to the rendezvous.
Juliet, it next leaked out, had merely a re-
volver concealed in her dress. Poor thought-
less girl! if she had only brought some
cannon and a bulldog she might be alive
and hanpy to-day.
A SONG OF MANNERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The outward manifestation of any great woman or
man is the manners of that woman or man. I would
like to see the cultivation of manners placed in the
forefront of the policy of the A.N.A.”
—Chief Justice Madden {Victoria).
Since Society began,
All the makings of a man —
Any free, enlightened citizen or gaoler—-
Have been credited by fools,
Who were taught it in the schools,
To the handicrafty efforts of the tailor ;
And the tailors, by-the-bye,
Caught on kindly to the lie;
They put it on their fashion-plates and banners.
But the one conclusive test
Of our Greatness at its best
Is the “form” we manifest in social manners.
Not the boots that guard the feet
Of a p'liceman on his beat
Are the slightest evidence of his charnfcter ;
No outward sign of grace
Is the beafd on Wowser’s face —
He had better be clean shaven, like an actor.
Many noble souls and wise
Wear the vilest things in ties,
And many speak of sixpences as “tanners,”
And are capable of slang
In political harangue,
But the Best are somewhat Madden-like in manners.
Though a parting you may find
In J. Madden’s hair-behind,
And he always wears a “frock” with his belltopper,
And when he starts to speak
He is wound up for a week,
Full of language quite supremely fit and proper ;
Not his clothing nor his tongue
Set examples to the young. ,
Lots of lesser lights are fluent spick-and-spanners,
And are equally ornate ;
But the Madden man is Great,
And the measure of his greatness is his manners.
Manners, manners marl; the man,
Our lives by common courtesies we gladden.
They have always marked the man
Since Society began;
But we can’t all have the manners of a Madden.
.VICTORIA.

his hands. A local artist guffawed: “Did you ever
see a live farmer without one of the sacks of the
‘Sack Specialist,’ T. Smith, Ltd.?” “Well, I never
took that much notice,” was the reply. “Always
remember,” returned the local paintslinger, “that
Smith’s sacks are as typical of N S.W. as the farmer,
and the address is T. Smith, Ltd., Sussex Street,

“Vic” : One Barker, of Brisbane, a Eureka
Stockader, is in Ballarat. (The list must
be getting pretty well towards the end.)
Barker was on sentry at the Stockade
throughout the Saturday night; bufr before
the morning broke, Lalor said to him, “Go
home, old man, and have a sleep.” So
Barker slept through the battle, which was
at dawn on the Sabbath. Roused by the
rumpus, he went to the Stockade, and saw
the dead lying about. The English com-
manding-officer passed with a file of pris-
oners. “Fall in,” he shouted to Barker.
“No,” says Barker; “I was not in it.” A
trooper then shot him, the bullet passing
right through his body. Even at that stage
the authorities had no idea about Lalor’s
share in the business, but concentred on
Black and Vern; and when the blood-money
was offered it was for one “Lawlor.” Which
recalls that when Robespierre first ap-
peared in the newspaper reports lie was
“Robertspier.”
NANSON, ex-Attorney-General of Westralia
and the largest politician in the continent.
Died at Port Darwin, Paul Foelsche, for
years and years Inspector of Police in the
Northern Territory under the S. Aus.
regime. After retiring from the service the
old man looked south ; but he found that the
climate of Adelaide, Melbourne and there-
abouts_ was quite unfit for a white man, so
he decided to seek old age in the Territory.
But it was a mistake —the North killed him
dead at a mere 83.
By the Oldest Inhabitant:—
The Earl Grey now visiting Australia is a descend-
ant of that Earl Grey who was a member of the Syd-
ney Legislature for Port Phillip in 1848. That is to
say, the Melbourne people elected him as a protest
against the other fellow and against the policy of the
Sydney Government. He beat the other fellow easily,
but when the astonished peer heard that he was a
member of the Legislature at Sydney he said the
matter required consideration. His ghost is still con-
sidering. Other candidates for Port Phillip who did
not know they were in the running were the Duke
of Wellington, Lord Palmerston, Lord Brougham,
Lord John Russell and Sir Robert Peel. Sydney held
an indignation meeting against Earl Grey and threw
decayed vegetables at his reputation; but these capers
helped to make the English people aware that Port
Phillip existed, and shoved the Separation movement
along.
Harry Hoyle, who has become Minister in
charge of N.S.Wales Railways, was the man
who, over 20 years ago, laised Sheol concern-
ing the Baldwin engines introduced from
America by Commissioner Eddy. The en-
suing Royal Commission cost a pot of money
without attaining any good object. But Hoyle
gets some of his own back by finding himself
where McGowen formerly sat in the Labor
Cabinet. In 1894 McGowen outed Hoyle
from Parliamentary life for 16 years by de-
feating him for the single electorate of Red-
fern (which Hoyle had represented as one
of the four Protectionist members for South
Sydney in the early ’9o’s). It was not until
1910 that brother Hoyle scrambled back.
JOE COOK OF THE KIND HEART.
A consignment of beef has been shipped to America;
it was branded “Armour” —News item.
THE ARMOUR BEEF T RUST: “ Good-bye , Joe.
'Thanks awfully for assistance in getting
my little lot of beef. See you again soon.”
Edward Tregear, ex-Secretary of Labor,
has resigned the presidency of the M.L.
Social Democratic party, which is the poli-
tical wing flapped by the Red Federation.
It has always been something of a mystery
why Tregear joined it, but probably mere
misplaced enthusiasm was at the root of the
mistake. In a pathetic note of resignation
he says:—
My fault was that I was an old man who did not,
or would not, know he was getting old....Then
came the waterside workers’ strike. I had never been
close up to a great industrial conflict before, and
the mental strain was too much for me....Also, I
have found in my experience of the last two or
three years that the workers are so divided among
themselves that to attach oneself or serve with any
particular section is to invite the most bitter hos-
tility from all others.
Yet, it is not very long ago that Tregear
attacked The Bulletin in Sydney Worker
for pointing out the cleavage in the ranks of
Maoriland Labor.
Iceberg Irvine’s first job in
Australia was as tutor to
Henry Ricketson’s children.
Irvine was just out from Ire-
land, and John George Doug-
harty, of Melbourne, took him
by the hand and got him the
Ricketson tutorship. The sal-
ary proposed was £300 a year,
but Dougharty said : “No fear!
Mr. Ricketson is a free-handed man and can
pay, and it will be £400,” and £400 it was.
Australia was good to Irvine from the
beginning.
Ronald Crawford Munro-Ferguson, who
is to succeed Lord Denman as G.-G., is for
the present a mere commoner, the son of a
colonel, in the British Army who became an
M.P. in his old age. The coming G.-G.
started out as a lieutenant in the Guards,
but threw up the Army for politics, and
entered the Commons in 1880 as member
for Ross and Cromarty. Since 1886 he has
sat for Leith. At the general election of
1910 he only managed to get back on a
minority vote. He is 54 years of age, and
was a Lord of the Treasury in 1894. He
owns 26,000 acres of land and has houses
at Kirkcaldy, Evanton and Cadogan Square,
which seems to be a guarantee that he will
now be made a peer. His wife is a daughter
of the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava, one-
time Governor-General of Canada, Viceroy
of India, and Ambassador at Rome. The
lady was born in 1865 and was married in
1889. She has in her veins the blood of
Richard Brinsley Sheridan and of the Irish
Ulster patriot, Archibald Hamilton Rowan
•—to which last it is to be hoped Thomas
Henley won’t object. Her grandmother,
Lady Dufferin, it was who wrote “The
Lament of the Irish Emigrant,” “Terence’s
Farewell,” and other ditties that have har-
rowed the Hibernian soul.
Among the metropolitan boys who won
State bursaries there is only one Eric, only
one Rupert, only one Cyril, and not a single
Percy. There is a truly encouraging number
of Johns and Jameses and Williams. The
complete absence of Percy is a cruel revela-
tion. Perhaps, after all, Percy merely ranks
with Fido.
Says “Nemo” :
Two of the best-known practitioners in the old
police court in Swanston-street, Melbourne, of which
so much has been lately written, on the occasion of
the opening of the big new place in Russell-street,
were Frank Stephen and Turner. Frank became the
father-in-law of John Madden, now Chief Justice of
Victoria. In private he was an agreeable, generous
sort of fellow, with side-whiskers, but in court, pro-
fessionally, he was “a terror.” I-lis style alone
cowed many a witness, and made him think that he
had committed murder and hidden the body when he
really only owed £2. Frank was attorney for many
burglars and footpads in his time. Poor Turner was
the very opposite of Frank Stephen. He was a tall,
quiet, conciliatory man, a barrister of one of the
Inns of Court in London. He had fallen out of his
position in the profession, and now figured as a police-
court attorney. He was always hard-up, and he took
any fee that came to hand —no matter about the size.
But Turner was always “the gentleman.” He knew
all the law that was going, and if he could have
sold his decayed but “genteel” suit and bought a
roar and an utter lack of courtesy with the money, he
would have grown rich.
John Dynon, of Lonsdale-street, Mel-
bourne, whom people used to talk about as
“the Chinaman,” made his will and codicil
sufficiently contradictory or doubtful to bring
it before Justice a’Beckett’s attention in the
Equity Court, Melbourne, a few days ago.
Dynon wasn’t a Chinaman; he was an Irish-
man, who sold china ware. Apparently the
proceeds of the business enabled him to accu-
mulate an estate of £52,000; but, as a matter
of fact, John had another source of
big income of which few were aware. He
was the owner of two valuable pubs, one in
Bourke-street and the other in Lonsdale-
street, which brought him a big revenue.
One was called “The Shamrock.” The pro-
prietor left £SOO a year to his daughter, and
the question raised in court last week was
whether the will and codicil clashed so
badly as to wreck the income. The Judge
reassured the lady.

The case of Richard Denis Meagher,
Speaker of the N. S. Wales Assembly, has
some points of resemblance to that of Thomas
Reibey, a former Speaker of the Tasmanian
Assembly. Meagher came to grief over the
Dean Case, but worked and plotted and
thus climbed to the Speakership on the lad-
der of his sublime impudence. Reibey, an
archdeacon in the Church of England at
Launceston, sued a well-known colonist for
libel and slander, and lost his cause. There
was a lady in the case. He resigned from
the Church, entered politics with some suc-
cess, for he was Premier (July, 1876, to
August, 1877) and “Colonial” Secretary
(December, 1878, to October, 1879). He
had nearly four years as Speaker (1887-
1891). Then he was an honorary Minister
(1894-1899) under Braddon, and even after
that the indomitable Methuselah tried to
form a new party and made a bid for the
premiership.
Died at Rand wick (N.S.W.) last week,
George Rest Kelly, aged 86. “Gee Bung'’
was probably the most ancient pub-keeper
m Australia. Half a century or more ago
he kept the Bathurst Hotel, on the corner of
Market and Pitt streets, where Farmer’s now
is, and at the same time his sign was over
the Royal Victoria Hotel, adjoining the
V ictoria Theatre, where now McCathie’s
nourishes.
GROOM ;
MINISTER
OF
CUSTOMS.
The father of Broughton Barnabas
O’Conor, Chairman of Committees in the
N.S.W. Legislative Council, was a church of
England minister, who was prepared for
hi" job by Canon Tom Smith, of St. Bar-
nabas’ Church, George-street West. Hence
the present M.L.C.’s second name. The first
he got from the first Bishop of Australia.
Among a host of Matthewses and
Mathewses in Melbourne, John Mathew, of
the Presbyterian Church, Coburg, is the only
Mathew. He has other claims
to distinction, too. One of
these is the fact that, though
now he is a gentle, black-coated,
greying shepherd, there was a
time when, in quite different
clobber, he herded cattle at the
Back o’ Beyond, and made
strange noises designed to push
unwilling stock on their way to
market. The reverend Mathew
is an M.A. of Melbourne Uni-
versity, and helped himself to
get his degree by grinding at
Latin grammar while the nag
mooched in the rear of the
mob. Long acquaintance with
Black Brother has given him
an unusually extensive know-
ledge of aboriginal manners,
customs and dialects, and he
has published a work which is
highly regarded by the small
circle of those-who-know. Now-
adays John Mathew attends
bazaars, spins sermons, and
looks after the battered Presb.v-
terian souls in Pentridge Stockade; but all
the time he keeps a keen and interested eye
on the doings of Australia at large.
Bishop Stretch, of N. S. Wales, but at
present in M.L. attending the medical con-
ference, obtained his gaiters as chief officer
to the then Anglican admiral of Queensland,
Dr. Webber. His headquarters were at
Roma, once the metropolis of Queensland’s
cattle-duffing industry, and Stretch started
out to civilise the heathen. In the Maranoa,
Balonne and other river districts of the
south-west there was at first much appre-
hension hut Stretch’s manner inspired con-
fidence, and, in the latter years of his reign,
when the “telegraph” brought the news of
his coming no one even bothered to take the
skin of last night’s beast off the fence. If
the enterprising parties thereabouts could
have placed as much faith in the inspector
of police as in the churchman, how much
simpler the problems of life would have be-
come;

Then to his son he said: “Isn’t that annoying!

Bowron Bros. Export and Trading
Co. (M.L. and Sydney) took over a Maoriland leather

When the first accounts of this co. were put on the
table on January 4, 1912, it was remarked that they
left a nasty taste in the mouth. The genesis of
the co. was bad. At the moment the co. was being
formed the M.L. Income Tax people were pursuing
Bowron Bros, for a very large sum alleged to have,
been evaded ; and the Income Tax people won. Almost
simultaneously some other Bowrons, who had more
or less represented the firm at the other end, got
into very much worse trouble in London; and although
it was alleged that these people had nothing to do
With the present co., the present co. was paying
£23,200 largely for the use of a name which most
people wouldn’t have valued just then at more than
about 21d. And while the new co. was thus pushed
under a cloud, and dragged still further behind it
by the shocking amount spent in flotation exes., the
early management did nothing to improve matters.
All it did was to give a coat of whitewash to the
sepulchre. It announced a div. of 10 p.c. p.a.,
which wasn’t a 10 p.c. div. at all, but one of some-
thing slightly over 8 p.c. ; and even that it should not
have paid. The co.’s first full year was equally
unsatisfactory. As remarked in January, 1912,, the
alleged profit for that term was probably a mere
guess; and the guess turned out to be wrong, where-
fore in the following year £2502 had to be debited
on account of profit previously over-estimated on
shipments afloat. Just before the end of the second
term the management was removed from Sydney to
Maoriland, where the principal business is done; yet,
though the new Board issued the balance-sheet for
1911-12, it now declares that it “only assumed con-
trol when 1912-13 had well begun.” Nadu rally the
new Board won’t accept responsibility for past per-
formances. As The Bulletin has remarked 914
times, the profits shown by a co. carrying merchan-
dise can be made little or big according to the
nature of the man who takes the stock ; an optimist,
or a man anxious to make things look good, is liable
to inflate profits by the simple means of overvaluing
the stock in hand. “The directors,” it is now re-
ported, “are of opinion that a portion of the loss
this year is attributable to the method of last year’s
stocktaking.” The directors make numerous other
remarks with acid in them. “The greatest difficulty
has been experienced in getting correct information";
in fact, it was almost impossible until the appoint-
ment of the present secretary and accountant. .. .The
conduct of the business has been pure guesswork and ,
trust in luck. Buying prices have not been gov-
erned b\' what the co. could afford to give, but by
the market which the co. in many cases created.”
The expenses also appear to have been prodigious.
Against the “working account profit from the tan-
nery and grindery departments” there are these items:
“General exes.,- advertising, directors’ fees, manage-
ment, etc., 11 4,163,” and “discount, exchange and
interest, £666:.”
Nevertheless, “given good and experienced man-
agement, the directors have every confidence that the
business will give a good return on the capital
employed.” The Bulletin not only believes that,
under the conditions named, the business ought to
be profitable, but thinks that, in valuing these £1
shares at about 55., the interested parties have taken
a too-gloomv view. Paid share capital is £139,815.
Deduct £32,053, represented by intangible assets,
and there is apparently £107,762 intact. Besides
that there is £60.999 owing to the 8.N.Z., which is
secured by £75.000 of debentures. Assume that the
stock is now fairly valued, and that the stocks afloat
brought at least the amount drawn against them (the
directors say that they had done so up to Dec. 20).
Then, after deducting the amount owing to the bank
from the value of the stock, the co.’s assets on Sept.
30 were:—
Per
Total. Share.
Book debts £20,071 2s. 1 Od.
Stocks (in excess of liabilities) . . 29,544 4s. 2d.
Tannery and other property and plant 58,147 Bs. 3d.
Total £107,762 15s. 3d.
The Bulletin is, however, not prepared to swear
that any of these figures represent true valuations.
The present directors say the stock has been twice
taken and every care exercised to get a fair figure;
but they don’t mention whether or not they have
valued plant, book-debts, property, etc. Still, if
these are written down very severely, there is a great
deal in excess of the present market valuation. As
for the business, no doubt it may have gone to
pieces ; but the profits ascertained by the Income Tax
Department from 1902 to 1907. and those for the
next two years, certified by Modlin, Crane and Co.,
averaged £24,400 a year. There is, then, or at any
rate has been, big money in the business ; and there
seems no reason why in future there shouldn’t be,
given good management. There will, however, need
to be a fresh issue of capital, probably at a prefer-
ence, in order to reduce the present excessive liabili-
ties; and this probability must of course affect the
position of existing shares.

There is a tremendous row on in this camp. On
January 5 “Jim” Clark, Edwin Munro and others—-
the two named being by far the biggest shareholders
in the co.—issued about the most blistering circular
sent out of late years over the names of responsible
people concerning a co.’s management. As the three
directors said in a circular which followed the other,
if the main statements are true the directors ought
to resign. But instead of proving the statements
untrue, the directors merely deny their truth, mostly
in a g’eneral way, and ask shareholders to “suspend
their judgment until we clear ourselves.” If they
can do it it is a giant pity they didn't do it in the
circular. To reply that, “carefully read,” the origi-
nal circular “is an attempt to deprive us of your
support, and to have that support transferred to
themselves or others,” is no answer at all. Of course,
if they believe the allegations (as, presumably, they
do), they want to get the business out of the hands
of the present directors. What else should they want
to do in such a case?
What seems to have brought the trouble to a
head was the carrying of a resolution—“on the chair-
man’s proxies,” so Clark, Munro and the rest say—
declaring .that no shareholder in any other gas co.
shall be entitled to hold any office or be employed by
this co. Clark and Munro are director? of the
Brisbane Gas Co. One concern’s mains are on the
South suburban side of the river; the other’s (the
Brisbane’s) on the city side. The two are not com-
petitors. In fact, The Bulletin can’t remember
a case where two gas cos. are competitors. The
general thing is to welcome on the Board of a small
concern a man who has had large experience, especi-
ally in big concerns. Thus Swinburne, now an Inter-
State Commissioner, was a director on many Boards
where his experience as a gas, power and water-
supply engineer was invaluable. Incidentally, Swin-
burne seems to be interested in the South Brisbane
Co. ; anyway, he wrote ridiculing the prpposal men-
tioned above. However, it was carried, and the
circular explains the way of it. If this motion
was forced on really to block the two largest share-
holders, or any other eligible shareholders in particu-
lar, from disturbing the present directors in their
seats, then the sooner they are disturbed the better.
True, a man’s intentions can’t well be proved. But
if the reason he assiglns is ridiculous, then a fair
conclusion is that the actual reason is the one
alleged by his critics. Apart from the other allega-
tions, the directors have a strong prima facie case
to answer here.
The table shows practically nothing written off
the assets for years ; on the other hand, on one occa-
sion £14,663 was written on to the assets. There
is nothing necessarily wrong about this, though.
Many a gas co., anxious to hide its profits, has,
dropped them into new mains, plant, etc. ; and it is
a fair enough thing for a co. to presently transfer
to reserves the amounts thus spent in excess of the
sum necessary to counterbalance actual depreciation.
Whether in this case depreciation has been thus pro-,
vided for it is impossible to tell from the
Dozens of times this paper has drawn attention to
the fact that Australian gas cos’, accounts have
hitherto been for flic most part so badly presented
that only a very few people behind the scenes could
have any idea of the true position of any particular
co. ; and the Queensland accounts have been worse
than most. In fact, changes having recently been
made in the law in N. S. Wales, the holder of
Queensland gas shares is now more poorly protected
than any other gas investor in •'Australia.' It is all
very well to plead that it is advisable to hide the
facts from the tiger of municipal Socialism, who
might otherwise be aroused to fury ; but in hiding
the facts from the tiger the management hides
them also from the general ruck of shareholders,
and it can easily be seen how knowledge on the
part of the very few and ignorance on the part of the
very many could be made of great advantage to the
few. In any case a thorough overhaul of the South
Brisbane Co.’s affairs by an independent accountant
of ln>h standing is urgently called for; and inci-
dentally shareholders should join in asking the Govern-
ment to bring in a Bill to provide for the publica-
-tion of more ample accounts.

The accounts now published are very different vege-
tables from those put on the table in the days when
there was no Gas Act, and the one idea among gas
cos. was to disclose as little information aspossible. The
present statements follow, generally, the lines adopted
by the Melbourne Gas Co. The general principle of the
Gas Act (1912) is to limit the dividend on old capi-
tal to 10 p.c., that amount being payable when gas
is sold at 3s. 6d. per 1000 ft., and allowing a rise of
i p.c. in the div. for every reduction of Id. in the
price of gas below 3s. 6d. For new ordinary capital
the div. is fixed at 7 p.c. (with the same proviso as to
increase) and for pref. capital at 5 p.c. No, reserves
may in future be capitalised ; hence nothing is to be
gained by piling up reserves. The idea is that, when
the business of selling gas becomes profitable enough
to permit of more than the abovementioned divs.
being paid, then the public shall enjoy the benefit
of a reduced price ; and to that end the accumulation
of. profits is restricted. The co. may pay for mainte-
nance, etc., of course; but there can be only three re-
serves—(l) for special purposes, limited in the
afro-regale to 10 p.c. of the share capital and pre-
miums on shares;(2) formal reserve, for which pay-
ments are not available until gias is sold, below the
standard rate ; (3) divisible profits account, really the
unappropriated Profit and Loss balance, which may not
at any time exceed a year’s div. at the standard rate.
The co. now for the first time shows its expenditure
on maintenance and reuairs; and. further, it writes
£5OOO off for general depreciation. It is very doubt-'
fill whether the Act allows of any sum being written
off against depreciation, and it seems ■ probable that
this £5OOO will have to be transferred to the special
purposes fund, which is a sort of contingency re-
serve. There ought to be a depreciation or replace-
ment account, because it may not always be conven-
ient to charge a big renewal against one term’s
revenue; but apparently the law doesn’t recognise
this.
The share capital now is £1,675,000 in “A” and
“B” shares, with a 10 p.c. standard, and £255,000
in “0” shares, with a 7 p.c. standard. All are £6
shares fully paid. After providing for the divs., pav-
ing for current repairs and maintenance and putting
£5OOO by against general depreciation, there is only
£1986 left over. This is a very narrow margin; but
whether it is due to any extra outlay on repairs and
maintenance The Bulletin doesn’t know. The Gas
Act is, so far as its general principles are concerned,
very excellent law ; but it will be simply impossible to
prevent a co., if it feels that way, improving its
plant, and thus reducing its visible profits, by charging
up to repairs and maintenance some of what might
more strictly be charged to capital. Certainlv the
co. would not be likely to unduly inflate its profits
just at present, application having been made to
raise the standard price of gas on the ground presum-
ably that at 3s. 6d. per 1000 the co. can’t pay the
higher wages fixed by Wages Boards and at the same
time maintain the standard dividend.

Meantime the co. has maintained its fine property in
Collins-street, which is certainly worth more now than
it was 10 years ago. Out of undivided profits it has
thus accumulated £49,082 in the 10 years. More-
over, it has accumulated that amount in hard cash,
which has been invested rather less than half in mort-
gages and rather more than half in public .securities. •
Lor a co. which has paid steady but gradually in-
creasing dividends on a capital of £90,000,' this
accumulation of a solid £50,000 iri 10 years pretty
well gives you the character of the co.—a co. which,
having a full appreciation of its functions and obli-
gations, aims at solidity above all things. It is
gratifying that it gets so much encouragement to
keep on with that policy. Estates in hand as at
December, 1903, were valued at £7,324,006. The
total now is £10,199,585. The increase should have
been greater; still to get nearly £3,000,000 of extra
business is a good performance. The persons inter-
ested in those estates have the satisfaction of know-
ing (1) that the work of looking after the pro-
perty, upon which many of them entirely depend, is
in the hands of men trained for the job; (2) that
beneficiaries are protected against the consequences
of misbehavior, in their -trustees by a paid capital
of £90,000, reserve funds of over £50,000, and
£210,000 callable from the shareholders; and (3)
this trustee cannot die or shift camp to Guam at an
inconvenient (or any other) time. From the share-
holders’ point of view, the position is first-rate. The
capital and reserves are in public securities, mort-
gages (£3S.2IS) and Coll ins-street property, which
has been steadily written down to what seems to be
well under market value; and, in addition to the ex-
cellent security for the principal (assuming that the
mortgages are right), there is the steadily growing
business which yields a profit very rarely less than
half as much again as the dividend hitherto paid.

Those mutton nies that Mrs. Sargent used to make
and sell in a little George-street shop have grown to
big things ; the co., which was formed late in 1908
to take the business over, has now about 35 shops
and cafes in Sydney and a couple in Melbourne.
Starting with a capital of £BO.OOO, of which no less
than £46,235 was represented by nothing but a
name, the c 5. has been able to maintain a 10 p.c.
div., and accumulate £33,478 of profits towards
replacing the intangible goodwill asset by something
more solid. Not that, even now, in spite of the
heavy reduction of the original deficit, the assets
are of the gilt-edged variety. There are freeholds
valued at £45,999, but on the other side there are
mortgages and other liabilities totalling £47,225.
For the rest, the canital is represented by leaseholds
and improvements thereon, £20,600; furniture and
plant, £42,740; stock, £11,125; and cash, etc.,
£.19,005. The leaseholds of course involve an amorti-
zation fund; in other words, this is a wasting asset
which has to be gradually written off out of
profits. Furniture and plant are other items of un-
certain qualitj'. While the; business is a going con-
cern they are doubtless worth the value put upon
them ; but if anything bad happened to the business
(and bad things do hapoen to most businesses sooner
or later, mostly when the people who built them up
are not on hand to preserve them), the crockery with
Sargent’s name on it wouldn’t be worth a very
great deal. The stock, cash, etc., may be accepted
as worth 20s in the £ ; but they run to only about
£30,000, and the capital is £lOO,OOO. However,
there is no falling-off in the profits; those for the
past half-year beat all past records. And there is no
indication of an early change. Australia’s habit of
feeding away from home is growing, largely, no
doubt, because of the great scarcity of Mary Ann.
Bad times will, nevertheless, make a big difference
to the trade. Food certainly isn’t a luxury that one
does without when times 'are not prosperous; but
thousands of the people whose silver goes through
Sargent’s cash-registers would either have a snack at
home or bring a bit to town in a paper parcel if
they didn’t have more money just now than they are
used to. The Bulletin hasn’t the faintest idea hpw
long the business will remain in its nresent condi-
tion. All it can say is that that condition is highly
profitable, that the hold of any catering firm or name
on the public is notoriously precarious, and that,
viewed apart from the business, the assets of the
co. are not of a quality that offer the best, or even
second-best, security for an investor’s principal. In
short, the investment involves a higgish risk, for
which only a substantial return is sufficient compensa-

Six months more and, all going well, that part of
this office which attends to the Wild Cat will leave
off work to give R. and W. three cheers. The co.
has put up a really fine performance, thanks largely
to the Greggs, who have been managing directors for
many years. Starting off with no less than £57,500
represented by goodwill in a total capital of £60,000,
it has accumulated profits until tangible assets have
taken the placeof the vast amount originally represented
by nothing but the ephemeral value of a trade name.
At times, hitherto, the accumulations have been
mostly hard cash on deposit; just at present, how-
ever, £42.28G is shown as “advances on properties”—-
not as good as cash, of course, but probably quite
safe, and made with an eye to profitable business. It
may be taken for granted that, at any rate, there
is nothing deliberately in the way of speculation
about it ; for this co. has kept out of the land
gamble, and has diligently pursued the perhaps less
fascinating but mighty commission. Including this
amount of advances as liquid, we get this result: —
1903. 1908. 1913.
Liquid assets .. £28,414 £32,631 £74,315
Liabilities . . 9,720 7,595 10,123
Surplus .. £18,724 £25,030 £58,192
There was a time when it looked as though the co.
might very well distribute some of the capital, since
the bulk of it was nearly always 'on fixed deposit ;
but apparently the directors see a way of profitably
employing most of it at times in the business. As
for the profits, the maintenance of recent figures can't
be expected; we have been having a land and pro-
perty boom, and booms are bubbles that must break
But the margin of profit in excess of the dividend
has been so wide, and there is so much more hard
money nowadays to earn interest for share-
holders, that only a very bad misfortune, or a whole-
sale abandonment of the policy hitherto adopted,
could null the dividend below its present level.

When this co., with others, formed the Carltpn and
United Breweries, Ltd., better known as the Melbourne
Brewery Combine, it was understood that various
breweries would be closed, Melbourne being over-
stocked with those factories. And as it was likely
that this co.’s premises wouldn’t be wanted, and as
they weren’t worth what they cost if used for any
other purpose, it was decided to set aside a certain
sum for writing them down. This sum was really
provided by the goodwill loading in the C. and U. B.
shares handed over to this co. That is, the Combine
handed this co. £72,500 in shares (face value), of
which about £48,000 was not represented by tangible
assets handed over. This amount was put to an
Assets Realisation Fund, and was not included with
the reserves in the table. Now, however, the property
has been re-valued, and the £23,208 required to write
the premises down from book to actual value has
been transferred from the fund. The balance has
been transferred to ordinary reserves, and part of it
has then been used to restore the capital which was
written down from 20s. to 11s. 6d. per share in
1897. So a 6 p.c. div. is now worth a shade more
than a 10 p.c. div. was until the recent restora-
tion of capital; and in starting off with an 8 p.c.
on the enlarged capital, equal to nearly 14 p.c. on
the old, it looks as if the co. has bitten off quite
as much as it can chew. Actually the dividend wasn’t
earned ; though it is true that the exes, were (say)
a couple of hundred pounds more than usual—no
doubt on account of the reconstruction. Giving that
in, the margin is excessively small; and a small cut
in the div. from the Combine, or a shrinkae-e in the
£lOOO or so received by way of rent, would compel
a reduction. As for assets, the £78.825 of capital
and the £lB,BBl of reserves are represented now by
£76,125 (face value) of Combine shares, £16,000
of brewery premises (severely written down), £4221
of pub property and a few sundries —cash and ad-
vances mostly. In view of the large amount of
water in the Combine stock it is impossible to regard
the assets as very solid, or the security as at all
gilt-edged.

The co.’s printers and painters would make it
Aaron’s; but they got it right at last. Of course,
no Aaron ever could be a hotelkeeper. Aaron it was
,\vho to Moses was “as a mouth,” Moses being of a
slow tongue and not eloquent; whereas the hotel-
keeper can supply everything but the mouth. For
many years the capital was £17,500, of which only
£2500 was represented by assets that you could
pour out of a bottle or sit on while you waited for
the other man to ask you about another. Then, in
order to get a renewal of the lease, the co. had to
spend a lot of money. More capital was, therefore,
got in, and at the same time or thereabouts the
directors wisely wrote off some capital so that they
might reduce the inflated goodwill account. More
wisely still, it was decided a little over a year ago
to establish a sinking fund “to provide for the return
of the capital at the end of the lease” (1930), and
apparently £225 a half-year is being put to the
fund. Unfortunately the exact figure can’t be
specified, because the amount set aside (shown as
written off) is lumped for depreciation of tangible
furniture as well as intangible goodwill. What is
called for is a separate account showing the progress
of the sinking fund, with the investments into which it
has been put. In that case the interest on these in-
vestments wouldn’t go through Profit and Loss at
all; and then the thing really would be a sinking
fund. Still, there has been a vast improvement in
the financial management of the concern. And, judg-
ing by the profits, in the general management also.
Reckoning that £225 a half-year is necessary to
restore the capital not represented by portable assets,
and that £75 should be put aside for depreciation
not covered by the half-year’s replacements, a profit
of £1065 could pay a 124 pc. dividend. That
amount certainly has very often not been realised in
the past; but of late it has been bettered. And even
£1375 in a half-year seems distinctly on the small
side for a pub. with Aarons’ connection, position and

Water-Supply engineers will be interested to learn
that further evidence proving the durability of W. I.
and Steel Pipes when coated by the Asphaltum pro-
cess, has just been obtained by the engineers of the
Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. Certain
alterations were made to the main which supplies the
City of South Melbourne with water, and consequently
some pipes were taken up. These pipes were made in the
year 1889, and were coated with Asphaltum composi-
tion in the usual way, and they were laid in ground
that was particularly unfavorable to the preservation
of any unprotected metal, being originally swampy
land, containing much vegetable matter, and filled
with tidal dredgings. On examination, these 24-year-
old pipes were found to_ be in an excellent state of
preservation, and the Board’s engineers were so satis-
fied with their condition that they decided to use
them again. They were, therefore, removed to the
works of Messrs. Mephan Ferguson Proprietary Lim-
ited, at Footscray, Victoria, where these 24-year-old
pipes were cleaned, retested, arid recoated with
Asphaltum composition in a new and improved pro-
cess. They are now being relaid in a position where
they will have to withstand a working pressure of
1351 b. to the square inch. That the Asphaltum pro-
cess for coating pipes is rust-proof and thoroughly
efficacious is proved by the foregoing.*

The profits are shown “after providing for wear and
tear and depreciation,” but what the provision
amounts to no man knows who doesn’t know much
more than the published accounts tell him. A mine
is a wasting asset; but the accounts don’t say
whether the management is writing down this pro-
perty to counterbalance the depreciation due to the
extraction of coal which, having been dug out once,
is gone for ever. There have been Newcastle cases
where a mine was alleged to represent almost t :e en-
tire capital of the co. up to the very moment w e i
the announcement was made that there were o ■ ■'/
three or four years’ supplies left in it. As a matter
of fact, in every case of that sort, the co. had been
paying dividends out of capital. The Bulletin
doesn’t know whether the same thing is being done
in this Wallsend case or not. The property is cer-
tainly not being obviously written down:—
Dec., ’O3. Dec., ’l3.
Liabilities •• •• •• £7BO £6,246
Mining and fixed property . . 89,790 91,890
Liquid assets .. .. •• 77,533 82,680
So mining and fixed property (plant, etc.) stands in
the books at more now than it did 10 years ago,
despite the extraction of a few hundred thousand
tons of coal. Still the mine property may have been
written down, the figures being maintained by ex-
penditure on railway and other property. It is a
case in which the ordinary investor is utterly in
the dark. If he likes to trust partly to luck and
partly to the ability of the co. to use its big cash
balance in picking up other properties in order to
carry on its unquestionably fine and well-established
business, well and good.
Important talks are going on between the
Broken Hill Prop., B. H. South and North B. H.,
outside the Sulphide Corporation the three biggest
mining concerns at Broken Hill. Neither South nor
North has a smelting works or refinery; both sell
their output of concentrates in the open market,
where the B. H. Prop, competes with the foreigner,
the foreigner being in this case German or Belgian.
The B. H. Prop, has very fine works at Port Pirie,
and the proposal now under discussion is that they
should be transferred to a Trust embracing the three
cos. It is ■ greatly to be hoped that the scheme
comes off. The Pirie works are now far in excess
of the B. H. Prop.’s requirements, so far as its own
ore is concerned, and so long as it has to depend
on casual purchases and contracts the business is
liable to be intermittent, which isn’t a good thing
for the town and the State where the works are.

The mostly' English-owned Mount Boppy,
the biggest gold-producer in N. S. Wales, has had
to close down owing to the long drought in the
Cobar district. Except for a few patchy showers
there has been no rain worth mentioning in that
part for nearly nine months. For the last six or
eight weeks the mine plant was kept going on the
town supply, but that at last got so low that the
co. had to be called off, and the dregs left for the
townspeople.

At Lionsville, in the Grafton district
(N.S.W.), a certain amount of development is being
done at the Mountain Maid and Garibaldi Consoli-
dated. The reef in these shows, though only inches
in width, shows gold freely. Some good small crush-
ings have been put through the Pucka battery, which
is now being removed to the Garibaldi; but opera-
tions are not on a sufficiently large scale to really
test the value of the various shows.
The Block 14 Torrington (N.S.W.)
seems born to trouble as the sparks fly upward. The
suction-gas power plant is the latest item responsible
for a temporary close-down. Even with everything
in good running order the outlook is poor, the ore
available being horribly low in wolfram and bis-
muth. The mill has now been running for some
months and the concentrates obtained are quite
inadequate to provide any. return for the outlay in-
volved in the erection of treatment plant. Unless
the contents of the ore show considerable improve-
ment the future is of most interest to the under-
taker.

The brightest days of Y Water (N.S.W.) are
past. Besides the obvious fact that the sluic-
ing area is diminishing, it is pretty well known
that the best available ground was treated first to
give the co. a lift over its initial troubles. What is
left to go through the boxes will not only not be
up to past average, but costs will be higher.

And to that loss you must add on a trifle for depre-

up against a granite bar, and if borings don’t prove
better ground beyond it, it won’t be worth working.
No. 2 plant is on richer ground (nine-tenths of lib.
to the yard), but it is infernally hard stuff. The
eo. has been looking around lately for another
block, and is going to exercise an option on a
fragment. Meantime, exclusive of stores, liquid
assets are about equal to the overdraft and other
liabilities. The paid capital is only £12,500, so
the co. doesn’t owe shareholders anything.

crushings, with 20 head of stamps available, are
ridiculouslv small if the reef now prepared for stop-
ing for a'length of 200 ft. is all that it is reported
to be. From the tonnage one would say that it was
either much smaller or very erratic. The main
unwatering level on Frenchman’s reef is now to be
driven towards the Robert Emmet crosscourse, at
which point a rich patch is expected. The capital
is £20,000 in 80,000 shares of ss. each, 17,560 of
which are held in reserve.
In a circular to shareholders Doolette the
elder attacks “interested parties who are spreading
prejudicial reports about the Bullfinch and its plant.”
Doolette laughs at the allegation that the present
mill cannot treat sulphides, but says .nothing about
the yarn that the new manager’s estimate of ore
reserves falls far short of that of his predecessor, the
late Fred Morgan. That is the rock on which the
market is said to have gone to pieces.
* * * *
A man on the spot writes: —Bullfinch’s
creep isn’t likely to interfere with operations to any
appreciable extent. A quantity of ore has of course
been lost for the time being above No. 2 level, but
there is ample stuff available in other parts of the
mine to keep the mill going at its full capacity. It
has been alleged that the creep affected the plant,
but so far there is no sign of this.
* * * *
Edna May (W.A.) has got its No. 2 level
out 100 ft. A big body of 2o'z. stone is still showing
in the south-west face, but in the north-east end a
crosscourse has come to light and displaced the reef.
The latter, however, is thought to have been thrown
a little to the north. The co. proposes to start
sinking the shaft from 150 ft. to 250 ft. this month,
and to install a plant to deal with the sands and
slimes accumulated and current. Local people who
claim to be in the know figure on the monthly out-
put being raised to £lO,OOO, and the profit to
£6OOO, with an additional £l5OO surplus when the
treatment of residues begins. Ore reserves are esti-
mated at 12 months’ supply.
* * * *
Paringa ’ (W.A.) reports a royalty revenue
for the year of £1468. Since 1909, when the co.
successfully engineered its last reconstruction, 27,000
tons have been extracted by tributors and treated
for a return of £35,836. One lode, Geach’s, con-
tributed ■ 9080 tons and £23,353 tp these totals.
Payable ore is still being met with in various parts
of the.workings on.tliis and other ore bodies, but the
management admits that, lately, “expectations have
not been fully realised.” The directors are consider-
ing the recommendation of the consulting engineer to
erect a small plant to deal partly with the ore now
being raised by tributors and partly with low-grade
stuff which at present does not pay to work and
treat at outside mills. Owing to the erratic nature
and value of the mine’s ore bodies, no estimate of
reserves is attempted.
* * * *
Paringa (W.A.) has sold its open-cut and
surface-rooted Cassidy Hill lease to a tributor who
has made a living out of it for some years. The
show was an impossible one for a cp; to try to work
at a profit, as nearly all the gold is found in small,
patchy leaders, which are frequently far between.
*** . . *
An annual conference of leaseholders and
prospectors sitting at Coolgardie has-been giving the
Scaddan Government a piece of its mind. One dele
gate complained that struggling leaseholders get
frowns instead of funds from the present Ministry,
and were unduly stirred up for rentals ; another con-
demned it for winking at, instead of putting a stop
to, speculative pegging at new rushes ; a third,
apropos the State mills, complained because the de-
duction for gold in tailings was too great and the
extraction allowance too small; several growled
about the delay in the payment for tailings; others
clamored for reduction : in rentals ; and nearly all
agreed that the Government was discouraging the in-
dustry, and that, the Department was being run by
officials and not by the Minister. In reply, the
conference is referred to by its Ministerial and other
opponents as a gathering of storekeepers, publicans,
etc. ; but as it is generally the local pub- and store-
keepers who back the prospector, they have a better
right to attend such a gathering than most people.
* * * *
The rise in Boulders is attributed in the
West to favorable reports about the co.’s Alaska
option. There has certainly been nothing in the
shape of developments at Kalgoorlie to justify any
rise. The breaking of new ground in some of the
higher “lower” levels is certainly being attended
with fairly good results ; but there is nothing in the
bottom. This year’s returns will probably average a
dwt. less than last year’s, and next year’s a dwt. or
so less again.
* * * *
Front Yilgarn (W.A.) : The outlook has
never been brighter. A number of the co.-owned
shows are looking well, and many of the smaller ones
are being nibbled at. Several are expected to be
floated shortly. Three boring plants are in operation
on various parts of- the field, new treatment plants
are about to be installed on the Edna May Central,
at Weston’s ; the Transvaal, at Southern Cross; and
the Butcher Bird, at Mount Jackson ; and systematic
prospecting is going on everywhere. The acquisition
of the Corinthian by the adjoining Corinthian North
will mean a considerable increase in the reserves of
the latter show ; and as working costs have been re-
duced to a low figure, big profits are expected to be
made —for a time at least. The final payment on
the Comet lease is due next month, and as the option-
holding Marvel Loch Co. has made another call it
looks as if it intends to complete the deal. At pre-
sent portion of the show is being worked by tributors,
but their lease is just about up. The note of warning
sounded by The Bulletin at the outset in regard to
the Comet has been fullv justified by results. The
reef is disturbed by granite bars at a comparatively
shallow depth and is difficult to follow. There is
some talk of getting Dr. Maclaren to look into the
matter. On present appearance the property has no
depth.
“Oof Bird” (W.A.) : Fancy values are
being reported by Adelaide syndicates holding options
at Holden’s Find, and the market has jumped in
consequence. One expert—Henderson, of the Mara-
roa —testified to the existence over good widths of
values ranging from 575. to 91s. ton; yet he
guardedly adds that “his impressions' are, on the
whole, favorable.” The naked truth about the
matter is that neither Henderson nor any other
engineer of standing has yet been induced to let him-
self go on the question of prospects. Appearances
are against the field being much in depth, and some-
thing more than the statement that, “on the whole,”
someone’s impressions are favorable is needed before
the public should rush in with big money.
* * * *
The Hodgkinson revival in N. Queensland
awakens many old memories, for between 1877 and
1912 this field provided 130,358 tons of stone averag-
ing £4 4s. The Tyrconnel, near Kingsborough, has
started crushing. It continues to open up a big reef,
in places 6ft. wide, at the 150 ft. level. Reserves
are small, because the show has been much worked in
the shallow ground, and it is impossible to say how
far the shoot will extend. The New Minnie Mox-
ham is also a revival. Its two levels are at 134 ft.
and 215 ft. on the underlay. At the lower level the
drives total 100 ft. in length, and show a reef 18in.
thick. So confident are the directors that they have
purchased a Cradle crusher in imitation of the Red,
White and Blue plant at Maldon (Vic.). No one
at this stage can, however, guarantee a tonnage of
payable stone. The quantity as yet proved is very
moderate.
Big low-grade propositions at the Oaks
goldfield (N.Q.) supply oread and dripping. Last
year 7182 tons were crushed for £11,899. The claim
that shows the most stone is the Mountain King,
which in. 12 months put through 2110 tons for
£1798. Mining (or, rather, quarrying) costs here
are low. Oaks Amalgamated crushed 1249 tons for
£1392. The short supply of water partly accounts
for the small tonnage. The shareholders are a hope-
ful crowd, and a much improved milling plant will
shortly start crushing for them. Thompson’s Oaks
put through 185 tons for £1053. Speculators have
lost pretty heavily on both the Amalgamated and
Thompson’s. The Amalgamated was reported to have
big ore reserves, but they proved very low grade;
and Thompson’s Oaks never had any reserves of much
consequence, though its* rich little crushings pro-
vided good bait.
* * * *
It looks as though what little there is of
the congestion disease in Queensland is going to be
partly cured by Nature. This interfering individual,
according to Government Geologist Dunstan, hid coal-
seams, up to about 45ft. in thickness, under an area
of 40 square miles near Bowen, and Dunstan has only
recently found them. According to an official state-
ment, “When a large extent of country between
Bowen and the Central Railway line and further
south is prospected, the probable coal reserves of the
State will be found to be enormously increased beyond
the estimate thus far given; and with an area of coal
country greater than that of N. S. Wales, there is
every probability of our cpal reserves being found
equal to, if not greater than, that State as explora-
tion and development increase.” As the new coal-
areas lie back of Gladstone and Bowen respectively,
and as the best natural deep-water ports on the
Queensland coast-are at those two places, while the
Brisbane River has to be dredged continuously, and
the back-of-B.risbane coalfields raked with a small-
tooth comb, it looks as if something like Divine in-
tervention is happening to help the neglected North.
The Mammoth, the Glasgow-owned North
Queensland copper group into which Australia
bought pretty heavily last year, got its first real
market attention lately when ' shares flopped from
40s. to about 265., partly on Glasgow sales, partly
on the unexpected suspension of smelting. The
Glasgow sales weren’t important, and the stoppage
of smelting was misunderstood. Audley Smith, the
very competent man who is the co.’s consulting
engineer, in a report made last month, says: “The
first plans of the co. were to mine fairly clean ore
and pick at the surface up to 9 p.c. or 10 p.c.
Recent developments have proved the. ore to be much
larger” ; and, as experiments showed that the stuff
could be cheaply dressed up to 9 p.c., smelting was
discontinued, pending the completion of a dressing
plant. He estimates that 43,000 tons of ore will be
dressed up to 23,000 tons of 9 p.c. ore ; and, altogether,
he puts the quantity available for smelting (includ-
ing that 23,000 tons) at 39,800 tons. This is ex-
clusive of “probable” ore, which has been pierced
but not opened up, arid on present appearances should
double the quantity mentioned above. Audley Smith,
while not committing himself to figures regarding
this “probable” ore, thinks well enough of the pro-
spects to recommend better equipment, including a
converter plant for the production of blister copper.
The mines, he says, “are still new ventures,” and
will call for a lot of development; but “they are
very promising on account of the large quantity of
interesting ground which has yet to be opened up
and the results which have already been attained.”
Costs he puts at £36 2s. 6d. per ton, or £5 less
with local converting; and he values the gold
and silver in the ore at £ll 13s. per ton of copper.
With copper at £65 this would give a profit of
£lB 11s. 6d. per ton, or £5 more with the converter
plant going. This means a profit in sight of (say)
£70,000 for a group of mines which have still a
great deal of promising ground to develop.
* * * *
Six months’ hard trying bv South Ger-
man, Maldon (Vic.), to tone up the market on the
strength of Baxter’s tribute hasn’t had much result.
The rise from 2000 ft. has been on improving values,
but all the puffing hasn’t convinced the unbeliever
that there is any permanency about it. The co.’s
own tally for the half-year was 122 tons from
2000 ft. for 440z.,' while tributors got 2041 tons
handled for gold worth £3742, an average of about
365. a ton. This grade would pay well, but the
trouble is to get enough of it. Maldonites want the
co. to try reefs west. As the Board isn’t too flush
of cash,' it won’t frivol money in theorising, prefer-
ring to hang on to the tributors’ shoot as long as
that gives a hope to build on.
Dick Hamilton, of the Boulder, has gone
back to the West, after his seizure of the Magdala-
Moonlight has-beens. at Stawell (Vic.). His deputy
is Gregory, of the Kalgoorlie staff, whose duty it is
to perforate the Cross, the Scotchman’s and other
reefs with the diamond drill. Samples of the faces
of the old stopes have been pronounced O.K. Hence
the moving of the diamond drill into the mines.
Six months ahead Stawell will know if it is to get
£200,000 of Boulder cash, or is to write itself
down as a derelict mining tramp. A million and a
half were poured into Stawell in the old days,
chieflv from where the flat reef functioned with the
vertical. “Saddle-reef” Dunn is cocksure that the
district system comprises huge saddles and “the
best-defined ore channels in the Commonwealth.”
Think how old George Doolette will roll this out
to London shareholders if the drill shows the big
reefs to be more than puff! The scheme of treatment
will, at any rate, be easy to the Boulder men, being
the usual roast with sliming and filter-pressing.
Victoria’s gold yield for 1913 was 437,984
oz., as against 479,281 oz. in 1912. The worst
feature is that the tailing-off has been continuous,
and the January figures of this year show a further
decrease of 3000 oz. If the Sludge Board biffs out
the dredging industry, as is likely, the State output
will drop below 400,0000 z., which will be less than
half of what it was 10 years ago.
The walk-in-walk-out sale talked about by
J. L. Wharton to the St. Arnaud (Vic.) citizens who
want more work done on the Lord Nelson mine there,
recalls that the show has been one of the bad bargains
of the Collins House “toffs.” They tacked the North
Lord Nelson on to the old Lord Nelson, and at one
time were as proud of the fusion as a pup over the
finding of a buried bone. All the mine has done since
has been to pay its way. As this won’t buy oil for
the Collins-street motor, St. Arnaud can have the
Nelson outfit, at a figure. And if it wants to keep
the mine open it will probably have to take it over or
do something of the kind.
The sugar coating to the second call of
Is. 6d. by the Mount Balfour (Tas.) is the announce-
ment that two “groups,” working together, have sub-
mitted a proposition for financing the whole under-
taking. Apparently this means that the big French
syndicate, lately talked of, has gone into retirement.
* * * *
“D.” : Some Kalgoorlie managers have hit
on a new method of locating pay ore. The trick is to
invite parties ■of men to take small portions of the
mine on tribute; 100 ft. on a particular level is the
usual offer. Then the miners with local knowledge
apply, indicating their pet spots. The managers
forthwith try these spots—and suddenly discover that
it was never intended to let those particular places
on tribute.
Molybdenite is worth looking for now that
the price has risen to nearly £4OO per ton. The
mineral is generally associated with wolfram, and
bismuth, and milling is then required to separate
the wolfram-bismuth ore from the other.


A rumor has been circulated that the
Misses Clapp are giving up business, but
there is no truth in the statement. They
will be in Sydney in February, and again in
July, as usual.*

A
WOMAN'S
LETTE
Sydney, February 9, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
The Stuart family, which lives out Stan-
more way —Papa is a big contractor in his
busy moments —is off to Maoriland for a
holiday jaunt. The travellers —who, despite
their name, have made no urgent claim upon
the British Crown—will start in the North
Island with samples of hot and cold mud,
have some fishing at Taupo, splash down the
Wanganui Rapids, then go south to the
lakes that lurk in the shadow of snow-topped
hills.
Prof. Moors, with his missus and daughter,
are leaving Sydney to attack Maoriland via
Melbourne and the Bluff on a long holiday.
They start at Invercargill, the cold, silent
place where the streets are a mile across and
the houses on the other side are about two
feet high, and all prohibition houses at that.
Invercargill is a pious place, but the ice-man
brings the religion round in a frozen state
every morning. The Moors will work up
northward to Auckland —thence, possibly to
Vancouver.
Invercargill, by the way, is the place where
it is a kind of religion to have a brass door-
step. It is made rather like a pillow-sham,
and slips on over the original whitewashed
nuisance. New arrivals in the squally town
begin by turning up their noses at the brass
doorstep fetich. Then Mrs. Newcomer finds
that even the milkman is not quite satisfied
with her social status, and the butcher’s boy
says he is not used to anything but brass
doorsteps (it means more polishing, of
course), and the greengrocer reckons she
must come from the islands where they don’t
have doorsteps. _So in the end another yel-
lowed sepulchre is added to the list.
The Walter Buhmeyers, of Bexley, just
back from a sojourn at Ivatoomba, report
the thrills that go with a dogged pursuit of
hired help on the mountain-tops. A fur-
nished cot on the heights is described as a
home away from home. You scrape the
saucepans in the same old way at an alti-
tude of 3000 ft. above the level of your Syd-
ney chores. Thirty shillings a week was
offered in vain to any strong, upstanding
girl willing to lend a hand with the domestic
grind. The pursuit of the unattainable got into
the Buhmeyer blood. Every day the least
exhausted member of the family went off in
search of Help, and returned —badly beaten
—after about one round.
Did you notice that Mrs. George Reid
took charge of a gold medal from the Ship-
wreck Relief and Humane Society before
leaving this township? Chairman Green, of
tb'ti Association, handed over the trophy to
Mrs. George to pass on to her High Com-
missioner. This entitles G.H. to a life
membership of the N.S.W. Society, whatever
that honorary non-life saving billet may _be
worth. Perhaps at long last G.R. is going
to plunge in and rescue his drv dog.
W. Redmond, M.P., the Home Ruler over-
seas scout who’s been here on a health trip,
goes off in the Marama to-day (Mondav).
Parson Hopcraft, who died the other day,
was, I think, a South Australian and a son of
an Anglican canon in the City of Spires. Be-
fore taking over the cure of souls at St.
Peter’s, Watson’s Bay, the late cleric had
the tough billet of following a venerable
landmark named Smith in the Canberra dis-
trict. Parson Smith had been in charge of
the Anglican conscience thereabouts for
something like 50 years, and only gave un
from the compelling circumstance of old
age. When a youngish man with modern
notions followed an ancient tradition, hoary
with the rime of sentiment, he bumped up
against something as soft as an ironbark
rail. Parson Hopcraft gave it up. But he
made a useful buffer between half a century
of Smith, and the present shepherd, Parson
Champion, formerly headmaster of the King’s
School, who now rounds up stray sheep on
the Yassberra plains.
Jack Playfair, who topped the municipal
poll at Waverley the other day, is only 23
years young. The juvenile alderman is a
popular infant, and incidentally he is a son
of Meat Magnate E. Playfair, who butchers
in a big w T ay hereabouts.
Ruth Bedford, a clever daughter of Man-
ager A. P. Bedford, of the Permanent Trus-
tee Co., recently returned from England
with a neat inky halo round her best hat.
Her latest effort is a charming book of
nursing rhvmes, called “Rosycheeks and
Goldenhead.” The illustrations by Mabel L.
Webb are good enough to keep youngsters
out of mischief for half a wet day. (We
have wet days sometimes, though they’re
hard to catch just now.) “Not a centipede”
is a rhyme that will, go to the right place in
every small boy’s cranium, as thus: —
Supuose, when I began to run,
That halt my feet should stop, for fun,
While fifty more went rushing past—
What would become of me at last?
The George Binnie family, or most of it,
of 4D station (this is the brand of the Binnie
wool) in the Quirindi sheep area, left for
England on Saturday.
Mrs. Paul, a versatile Sydney woman who
dabbles seriously in Art, recently landed
here after six years absence from her native
gum-tree. In Paris, where she studied in
the Julien School and at the Collorossi Aca-
demy, Mrs. Paul was struck by the number
of leading American teachers who were
having Refreshers in Art, as students in
those well-known studios. During three
years residence in the States the vivacious
Australian was profoundly impressed with
the power the generally voteless American
woman wields in civic affairs. Incidentally
canvas seaside camps on the American coast
are cheap and comfortable propositions com-
pared with the frequently uncomfortable and
exorbitant seaside hotel or boarding-house.
“You can buy a three-roomed brown canvas
tent house in the States, with a well-made
hardwood floor, for £30,” muses the returned
traveller. “I’m surprised they’re not a
craze here in the surfing season.” As the
Waringah Shire Council nearly fainted dead
away when a canvas settlement was sug-
gested by the Seaside Camps’ Association
I suppose there’s something contraband
about the cloth dwelling that ordinary folk
don’t understand.
Ex-Governor Chelmsford, who was a good
tip for the G.-G.-sliip a week ago, has ap-
parently been beaten by an eyelash.
The new man, Mr. Munro-Ferguson, is a
long-headed Scot, and he trots in double
harness with a daughter of the first Marquis
of Dufferin. who vice-royed in India years
ago. The Dufferin title is young enough to
be only taking its second airing with the
present wearer of the bauble.
Long Jack Cormack, recently of the
N.S.W. Tourist Bureau, writes from Lon-
don. He finds it cold and damp and doesn’t
hope to see it any damper. Also the atmo-
sphere is pale grey and at times a trifle
suggestive of pea-soup. Londoners call it a
mild winter, but some people would call
almost anything by any name under the
sun. With Mrs. Jack he went to a serious
afternoon party given by a Mrs. Stovin, at
Connaught Place. As he is in England on
the Australian Government irrigation
racket, he gave the company (by request)
a hint of doings in the Murrumbidgee area.
The party was related to “the Australian
League” (in London) in connection with
“The Colonial and Continental Church
Society.” It aims at passing round the hat
on behalf of outback clerics in this con-
tinent —that weary, disreputable, degrading
old cadged hat that some well-meaning per-
son is always passing round to make the
world think we are paupers. Cormack drew
a touching picture of Sky-Pilot Free-
man—about 6ft. 6in. of Bush Brother —
literally building a place of prayer, and
making adobe bricks to do it with. His
Anglican Legs of Ballarat. Mr. Joe Bar-
ling, the Cecil Darleys, a contingent of
Saumarez Smiths, etc., were in the com-
pany. The gloom was made visible by wax
candles, and two gorgeous footmen stoked
the visitors with light refreshments.
Mrs. Dillon Bell, of Neutral Bay. gave
a huge tea-spread to farewell the Edgecliff
heiress, Miss Ducker. who is packing up for
the world tour I told you about some time
ago. About 40 persons poured wet goods
down their thirsty throats in honor of the
lady.
Mrs. Moreau, a well-known Darling
Pointer, farewelled several Sydney dames
who are on the wing, the other day. Mrs.
Albert Nathan. Mrs. IJenriques, Mrs. Arthur
Gleeson, and the much tea’d Miss Ducker
were the birds of passage who had this
lunch, bridge and final clatter of teacuns
hurled at them by the hostess. Mrs. W. F.
Brennan took a hand at bridge amongst the
best players present, and Mrs. A. E. Hughes
was one of the nicest-looking young persons
present.
Artist Percy Spence is packing up his
paint-box for a flight to the Fog. He takes,
as excess luggage, a huge canvas, “Arrival
of the Australian Fleet.” This painting is
to be handed over to George V. as a slight
token of esteem from the Prince Alfred
Yacht Club and others. The King has
graciously notified the donors that he will
not turn it away from his royal doorstep,
or cast it into outer darkness, or chase it
with execrations into the wilderness.
Shakspeare’s Tercentenary party will get
a fresh fillip from the April f£te on the Syd-
ney Cricket Ground. Those who believe
that the Bard is in need of moral or financial
help will be able to rush to his memorial
festival on Sydney Cricket Ground eight or
nine weeks hence. A fresh bone of conten-
tion in the shape of “a literary and artistic
stall” will be arranged by some of our women
journalists. Why don’t they have two stalls
—a Shakspeare one and a Bacon one? They
might each be divided into two sections—
one for people who believe Hamlet was mad,
and one for those who think he was simply
disguising his brains.
Concerning journalism, a small, strenuous
American man, Prof. Williams, of Missouri,
has been dined and wined by the N.S.W. In-
stitute of Scribes (not Pharisees). After
President Ileney had flung a few remarks of
an affable nature at the man from Missouri,
Livingston Hopkins (better known as
“Hop” in two hemispheres) supported the
toast to his compatriot. When run to earth
later on, “Hop” remarked: “Prof. Williams’s
speech iast Friday was up to sample as a
specimen of American after-dinner oratory,
and as one of our morning contemporaries
would put it, his accent ‘left nothing to be
desired.’ It was disappointing in one respect
only. England expects that every American
should ‘guess’ and ‘calkalate.’ Prof. Wil-
liams never guessed once. He seemed pretty
cocksure on everything he said —even upon
the gospel of a school of journalism... .He
makes vase rhyme with face.’. ..It is only
fair to add that our distinguished visitor
spoke of ‘your noble ’ instead of ‘your beauti-
ful’ harbor—an instance of versatility in the
use of epithets highly commendable in a high
priest of journalism.” “Hop,” like many
other authorities, rejects the vain imagining
that journalism can be taught in any school,
and believes in the famous academy—Experi-
ence.
Tenor Cecil Sherwood (sometimes mis-
called “Percy” by his friends) is going to
sing with all his might and main in the
Town Hall. March 9 is the date of this
farewell warble. Cecil, who is just looking
over the golden rim of 20 years, is a son of
Superintendent Sherwood, of the police. For
the last 12 months he has been studying
vocal gymnastics under Andrew Black, who
advises him to get into opera, via a stiff
course of European training. So the boy
goes off to Milan on April 15, to begin work.
He has been singing, more or less, since he
lifted a juvenile soprano at the age of
seven, in music suited to his then infantile
understanding. Perhaps he’ll make a noise at
Covent Garden in four or five years. Mrs.
Trefl6 took the chair at last week’s big meet-
ing re the Sherwood farewell concert.
The first of a series of matinees in aid of
the Royal Hospital for Women and the
Renwick Hospital for sick babes, occurs on
Feburary 20. Her Majesty’s Theatre will
be the jumping-off place for this charity
cycle.
Alfred Hill’s Maori opera, “The Weird
Flute” and an operatic outbreak by Fritz
Hart, “Pierrette ” are to be produced to-
gether, if the National Australian Opera Co.
materialises behind a bank account. Hill
has a strong dramatic instinct to back up
the attractive harmony that throbs under
his hat. Fritz Hart, a slim, boyish-looking
musician, used to jerk his baton over a thea-
trical orchestra here. Now he is deputy
something at the Marshall Hall Conserva-
torium (Melb.) while the Chief Crochet is
away.
Cricketer C. Kelleway has bustled off to
Maoriland on an excursion of business
sprinkled with pleasure. He is going to
keep his ears open for any shouts for help
from the Australian XI now batting in the
Dominion, and hopes to renew his acquaint-
ance with Maori pals in the geyser district.
When Kelleway was playing cricket over
there about four yea,rs ago, he went to
Rotorua with two or three members of the
team to have a look at the breath of the
Devil as it comes up from down under. Ro-
torua entreated them to have an exhibition
match, and celebrated the event with a
gigantic picnic. To make up Kelleway’s
side —which played Rotorua—five or six
Maoris were picked. Brown Brother in
Whakarewarewa (this word goes on in-
definitely) is still yearning to remind the
Australian cricketer that a Maori made top
score on that eventful occasion.
Miss E. Grosholz, a Maoriland singer who
has been away from her native shores for a
considerable time, recently returned from the
other side of the globe. She leaves Sydney
in the Maunganui to see whether the
Dominion of Massey is in its old accustomed
place or whether it has gone wandering after
strange gods and Cohens.
How this hamlet amuses itself may be
guessed from the fact that one leading music
warehouse here takes about £230,000 a year
for booking seats in the principal theatres,
etc. This sum does not include picture shows
nor various other amusements, but it covers
that particular firm’s concert booking.
Another reason to believe that capital has
not wholly fled from N.S.W.
The Chisholm sisters, who hail from Lis-
more or thereabouts, are off to England in
March. They are the girls who have been
doing things in the musical line with some
small local thunder. Pianist Maggie won
the Emmeline Woolley scholarship in 1913.
This gives her a free show alternately at the
Royal Academy of Music and the Royal
College of Music (London) for three years.
Sister Lena has snatched a scholarship for
her fiddling. She’ll get a fresh embellish-
ment or dado of technique in London for
her pains. Mrs. Tom Hughes, Mrs. Macken
and! Mrs. McDermott were responsible for a
gathering that pledged itself to pull a com-
plimentary concert into position on March
5. Concordia Hall will be the place. Wil-
liam McMillan took the chair at this
meeting to abet the Chisholm sisters’ fare-
well to their native clod.
Dolores leaves this town on February 14
for her tour through Maoriland.
The Scottish tourists, James Craig and
his daughter, who have been wandering
round the edge of this continent, finished
their Australasian cruise with a comprehen-
sive snack of' Maoriland scenery. Now they
are taking a stack of complimentary remarks
—in strong Doric —back to the land of
kilts.
There’s nothing new about the transpar-
encies of the moment. In the days of the
French Consulate feminine dress became so
sketchy that Parisiennes actually died of
what was called “an epidemic of the French
modes.” The three-flounced (or terraced
skirt) which is coming into grace, is said
to trace its origin to the days of Moses. “In
those days,” says a French writer who
sneaks as if he had been personally present
at the borrowing of the 10 Commandments
from the code of Khammurabi, “it was not
knife-pleated as it is to-day. but vras draped
in tiers.” The lampshade lady, however, is
of later date than Moses, for I think she
grew in Paris.
The Eternal Rag, feminine gender, is
again holding up the traffic in our Best
Shops. Autumn fashions, by right of iron-
clad precedent, always bud in sultry Febru-
ary. In consequence, our Nicest People are
languidly mopping their damp countenances
as they gaze respectfully at furs that would
be cosy wear for an Esquimau ladw
The pony jacket is a smaller size this season.
It is inky black, and a cross cut between a
mantle and a jacket, and it ends in a neat
tail that finishes off a pouch of drapery be-
hind. Black fox fur shuts out any draughts
round the neck. A pony coat runs into any-
thing from fSO to £lOO. The enterprising
woman who hurried into the business —say
in the Shetland Isles, where you can buy a
whole pony for 42s. —before fashions changed
to something harder to kill, would make a
competence for her old age. Wild beasts are
reluctantly contributing their skins and
claws to lovely woman. But the weak points
about leopard or tiger mats, apart from their
fiendish price, are their shrieking patterns.
White tailless ermine—also for the Rich —
made up like a fall of snow inset with lace,
is another Arctic fantasy in February.
The French frocks that floated over wire
frames at an autumn show last week are
mostly built in tiers or terraces, edged with
fur. Black tulle or net evening gowns, for
instance, with capes of the same material,
show the 1914 tendency to hide the back of
the neck. That is to say, you pretend to
hide your shoulder blades by wearing a cape
rather more transparent than a butterfly’s
wing.
Beauty red—twin shade to carnation
—and tango are the colors that fight a bilious
mustard-green for first places in the ever-
lasting dress parade. Skirts are not slit—
they are wide open to the knee in front, in
these Paris models. There’s a kind of lap
over, of course, but the lap wouldn’t cover
one per cent, of stocking on., a breezy day.
Tango is the color of a ripe tomato as it
sizzles in a frying-pan, and the tango dress
is rather more so than the X-ray garment.
Oddments to pile up the trimmings on the
new frocks are plaid and shot silk, and shot
velvet. Queer, baggy skirts —they bag at
the hips and fit the ankles after the fashion
of sticking plaster—like the old-fashioned
riding-habit when you harpooned it at the
sides with pins after getting off your ancient
three-horned saddle—appear to be It this
year.
For some time conscientious pedestrians
have been cultivating habits of keeping to
the Right, not expectorating on the foot-
paths, and preferring to swallow their tram-
tickets rather than let them lie around the
already untidy scenery. Now they have to
hurriedly unlearn the first commandment
and keep to the left —by order of the police.
While the white cotton gloves of the Law
are pushing or prodding bustling persons,
to the left they might, by way of a change,
move on the crowds of male idlers who keep
neither to the right nor the left, but stand
stock still in every busy thoroughfare, filling
the atmosphere with lurid language and
otherwise obstructing the traffic.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.
“A III.”: Caton Woodville, the military
artist, has published a book of reminiscences
in which he asserts that he was. the first to
give the British Government an idea of the
military preparedness of the South African
Republics before the last war. “Tripe !” as
Joe Kook would say. We have the word of
that fine soldier, General Butler, then in
command at the Cape, that he was in pos-
session of the fullest details as to the equip-
ment of the Republics, and passed them on
to the War Office. These details were
gathered by such men as Colonel “Mike”
Remington, who, as a whisky traveller in
Johannesburg and Pretoria, got the very full-
est notes of armaments, etc. It was the
British War Office and not the S’African
Intelligence Department that was at fault.
Why the War Office did not make more use
of the information is not known to this day.
It may have been dunderheadedness; more
like it was the same old swelled-headedness.


Give me the
Rudge-Multi”
v
says the man
who owns one.
The man who has tested the merits
of the RUDGE=MULTI Motor Cycle
can talk from practical experience.
Here’s his testimony :
Mr. George M. Mohr writes: —
“I would like you to know that the Rudge Multi and side-car I pur-
chased from you through your Wagga Manager, Mr. S. Ralston, has given
me the greatest satisfaction possible. I have put the machine to the most
severe tests—one of them being two ladies in the side-car, one on the
back carrier aftd myself in the saddle (4 in all). With this load I
travelled six miles of very bad road, including one very steep hill, which
it took without a falter. For Strength, Speed, Simplicity and Reliability
give me the Rudge Multi.
You are perfectly welcome to use this letter, and if anyone doubts
my statement I shall only be too happy to prove it to be true.”
The Rudge is a motor-cycle that a man can be proud of.
It has a particularly smooth-running engine of 31 h.p., with a large silencer.
It is an easily understood machine, clear in design, free from unnecessary
wires, tubes and other bric-h-brac.
The method of control is simple, and enables a rider to feel confidence under nil
circumstances.

By NORMAN LINDSAY.
Price, 1/- ; Post Free, 1/1.
As Australia’s foremost Black and White Artist, Norman Lindsay and his work are well known
and highly appreciated, but no one ever dreamt of accusing the artist of being an author. Neverthe-
less the fact remains, and when we say that the work of the author is on a par with that of the
artist, our readers will know what to expect. “The Curate in Bohemia” fairly bristles with bright
things, and the illustrations alone are well worth the money. That so much, genuine humor can be
got out ot the adventures of the luckless curate speaks volumes for the ability of the artist-author
who has so suddenly leaped into the literary limelight.

Dig Post Holes
4 times faster
and easier!
The old crowbar-and-spade method is
simply drudgery compared with the
“Iwan” Post Hole Digger.
First of all, The “Iwan” bores into
the ground four times faster than other
tools. Second—it bores the hole just
about right for the post. Third —it
leaves very little earth to shovel back
and ram. Fourth —You get a firmer
fence.
On the other hand, digging with bar
and spade, you have to make a hole
twice as wide as you need, so as to get
the depth. Then you have a heap of
earth to shovel and ram.

out one!”

What is this
Farmer doing?
He’s using a Starrett Levelling
Instrument No. 101, because he feels
that Farm surveying by guesswork is
risky.
Farmers, as a rule, have most of the
latest tools and implements for doing
farm work, but rarely will you find a
levelling instrument included in the kit
-—simply because they do not care to
pay the price usually charged for a sur-
veyor’s or engineer’s level and transit.
The result is that jobs needing a level
have been done by guesswork, and there-
fore unsatisfactorily.
The Starrett Levelling Instrument No. 101
gets you out of the difficulty. The price com-
plete, with long legs and 12in. Sight Tube with
Cross Wires, is but 46/-
Starrett No. 101 guarantees accuracy on all
kinds of drainage, under-drainage, irrigation
work, terracing land, road making, setting out
orchards, grading of all kinds, fencing, getting
angles, and every farm job requiring such an
instrument. Your neighbors would gladly hire
it from you at times.
Japanned Telescope Legs give a height from
2ft. 6in. to 4ft. 6in. Packed Weight,
13flb. Full instructions for use sent with
each instrument, 46V - complete. We also have

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, February 9, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie. —
A somewhat belated item of English
Christmas news from sprightly Marjorie
Raphael (late Heinbockel) throws a humor-
ous sidelight on the new responsibilities of
that interesting young matron. In a letter
to a Melbourne friend she mentioned that
one of her guests—Arthur Villiers, son of
the Lord Jersey who reigned in Sydney long
ago—had got her to donate a Christmas pud-
ding to a Boys’ Club at the East End of
London. “ ‘Pudding’ is a wide term,” said
Mrs. Norman Raphael. “In this case it will
have to provide for 250 boys, so it is worse
than it sounds.” By the way, many admir-
ing comments on the clever little Melbourne
girl are blowing in from across the water.
Her small size in feet has been noted, also
her creamy complexion and Madonna-like
profile. And above all, the free and en-
lightened character of Marjorie’s conversa-
tion is remarked wherever she goes. Her
native wit is distinctively Australian. The
smart set must surely vote her “ripping.”
Marie Lohr (Mrs. Val Prinsep) has given
her first-born the straight-laced name of
Jane. From which one supposes that poor
old “Jane” is getting to be fashionable
once more. Time was when it stood
for blue blood and bad luck in English his-
tory. For instance, there was Lady Jane
Grey, who was proclaimed queen before her
head was cut off. Previously Jane Sey-
mour, Queen of Henry VIII. and mother of
Edward VI., had cheated her husband of a
royal execution by most inconsiderately
dying a natural death. Perhaps it was the
fate of Jane Grey that finally put the name
out of fashion in the best circles and re-
duced it to the housemaid level. That almost
historical lady of beer and the police-court,
Jane Cakebread, didn’t improve its popu-
larity either.
Mrs. Leslie Stuart, who will send along
some precious antiques to the Denman Loan
Exhibition, is still pondering whether to
include her Napoleon dessert dishes and let
the precious, fragile things take their chance.
The dishes are a beautiful blue, and have
the initial N encircled by the modest laurel
wreath affected by the big-little man. They
are also embellished with burnt-in miniature
portraits of famous Court beauties, signed
by Humberts. Mrs. Stuart is also sending
a pencil portrait of Hallam. It belonged to
Tennyson, whose distinguished ghost perches
on one of the top branches of Mrs. Stuart’s
family tree or weed. The gay little blonde
lady aforesaid is shortly to be left a grass
widow for several months, her husband hav-
ing to go to England on business. The trip
is too brief to disturb the house and family
over, so she is staying comfortably at home
with the children.
Miss Haywood was married from the
house of her sister, Mrs. Leslie Stuart, with
a great deal of homely fuss, including brides-
maids, cake and so forth, but no outsiders.
The bride is a daughter of the late clergy-
man Haywood, who used to be chaplain at
Port Arthur, Tasmania. Mrs. Haywood
now lives quietly at Sandringham. ' She
feels that she has done her duty by her nine
daughters, of whom Marjorie is the eighth
to marry. The last remaining girl is the
youngest, and has plenty of time left in
which to. find an altar-partner. Woodside,
the Toorak house of the Stuarts, is com-
pletely surrounded by its gardens, and when
all the motors had oiled up the drive, and
the last and latest perspiring guest had
rushed to the festivity with his mouth full
of apologies,. the party was as secluded as
if it were being held at the Back o’ Beyond.
The bride’s mother has an old-fashioned but
charming and sensible horror of the display
of presents—-“vulgar,” she calls it; so the
flashing glories of the guests’ gifts could only
be peeped at through tissue paper wrappings
in. the privacy of bedroom bureaux. The
bride, embroidered nearly all her trousseau
dainties with a little help from her sisters.
Two little Stuart' girls—Nancy and Lav-
ender —helped three grown-ups to brides-
maid the ceremony. The bride herself was
a sweet occurrence in a simple Frenchy
frock and a veil of cut tulle, unadorned and
unhemmed. The bridegroom, Mr. Rutty,
wore an appropriate air of delight and some
male clothes of the usual unsensational pat-
tern. All the big clan of Stuart sent greet-
ings and beautiful house furnishings, and
the married sisters and brothers-in-law (God
bless them!) added to the presents. (I love
to see the rich being kind to one another.)
Parson Hughes, an old friend of the family,
tied, the important knot —at least, it was
an important knot to “the high contracting
parties,” as they say in the treaties.
The de Grut dame is shaking the dust of
this city from her feet (also her hair,
shoulders, garments and other belongings),
and is going gadding for a spell. Mammas
who have just “got off” a daughter are apt
to feel like a balloon cut from its moorings.
Dudie Griffiths is the next girl programmed
for a flqffy wedding. She is to be altared
this week to Ken Niall, brother of Margaret,
who marries Gubernatorial Help Burnham
a month hence.
Bachelor-doctor McGee, of Collins-street,
is making off for a long foreign trip. Pretty
sister Fairie goes along as chaperone.
The Mayoress of St. Kilda has been
seriously ill since her husband assumed the
rabbit skin and dust-bin of office. The lady
is now convalescent and is to make a brave
try to do her superfluous duty by her sub-
urban realm at the end of the week, when
she is to hold a reception at the local Town
Hall and do a long handshake with the most
loyal and abject section of the ratepayers.
The heroism of the unnecessary!
The memory of Janet. Mrs, Clarke gets
freshened up periodically through the untir-
ing efforts of her devoted family. Daugh-
ter _ Mrs. Landale has just commissioned
artist McCubbin to paint a full-length por-
trait of the deceased benefactress for the
Women’s Hostel of Trinity College—a pet
charity of the lady who is gone.
The engagement of an attractive Melbourne
girl, which was gushfully alluded to by vari-
ous women as something too exquisite for
words, has been cancelled in the most un-
romantic circumstances. The young man, it
appeared, lost his chance when the subject of
marriage. settlements was tactfully brought
up His evident anxiety to make his future
quite safe at her expense wearied the lady,
and she dismissed him.
The Dudley Countess has been flying about
—in the air. One of her recent trips was
as passenger with Gustav Hamel on the
monoplane that was built specially for loop-
ing the loop—quite a frivolous proceeding
for so cold and stately a lady.
Rippon Lea, the old Sargood home at
Elsternwick, is looking like its former self
just now, being arranged for a charity fgte.
The event is fixed for Saturday, February
14, and there will be soft Japanese lanterns
and fireworks when darkness falls on the
scene and the lover throws his arm like a
boa-constrictor round his lady’s waist. The
indispensable “object” is the Prahran stall
at the forthcoming Alfred Hospital Bazaar.
Female political scrambles are real god-
sends to some of the scramblers’ husbands.
You see, your real Leaguer allows the home
and the husband to go to pot when there
is any excitement on, and the speed with
which the husband proceeds to pot (as re-
presented by a late cafe) shows how glad
he is that women are taking an interest in
public affairs.
Artist Will Longstaff is holding a private
view of the picture he painted at the special
request of the Bananaland Government —a
fine portrait of Lieut.-Colonel W. H. Tun-
bridge. As a pretty side-show there is a
just-completed portrait - of little Miss
Deschamps, whose proud father is delighted
at the Longstaff portrayal of his daughter’s
bewitching smile. There is also a portrait
of the late Otto Schmidt, e fine-looking, well-
groomed man who was widely known in the
paths of commerce. His son is so pleased
with the portrait that he has ordered a
replica to send to Germany. The hard-work-
ing Longstaff has a handful of water
color studies of the nude —an Australian Eve
wandering pensively on the shady banks of
a blue Australian billabong.
Flying-man Hawker climbed the invisible
stairs of the sky in his sputtering chariot on
Saturday at Caulfield, and thereby amused
many thousand people. He ascended almost
at schedule time with as little fuss as a man
starting off flatly in an earth-borne motor-
car ; and he gambolled about in space like the
noble but aimless and unemployed albatross.
A pink carpet of faces looked up at his re-
mote boot-soles, and the owners of same said
that it was wonderful and they never could
have imagined it, which was quite' true of
the majority of them. More banal remarks
were made and more feet trodden on, than on
any previous local occasion, and on Monday
morning the daily papers let their hair down
and went on about it in the usual old-maidish
manner. It must be very gratifying for
Hawker —if he likes that sort of thing—but
he must have been amused at the excitement
and unaffected delight of the simple villagers
of Melbourne. V.A.T.C. members, though on
their own premises, had to pay their half-
crowns. John Madden, with a grey felt hat
pulled well over his ears, waited in the vice-
regal loose-box for the G.-G., in com-
pany with an aidelet (a local, amateur
Help). The Denman dame, wearing appro-
priate white wings in her 1 at, was otherwise
garbed in black, like Miss Hugessen, who
accompanied her. The little G.-G. and Help
Barttelot both paraded in brilliant striped
ties of black and scarlet. The girl who
eventually flew —Miss Dixon —spent a great
deal of thought on her dress, and a Collins-
street milliner thereby 'got a good advertise-
ment. The hat was shiny black waterproof,
and stuck in the side was a bright waterproof
waratah. She was distinctly annoyed at
the necessary goggles, and peeped under them
when the rude crowd shouted at Hawker,
“You’re on a good wicket!” It certainly
looked as if they were eloping. They soared
together into the blue, and the sputter of
the engine gradually died away as they
dwindled down the skies and disappeared.
The aviator, though, was merely taking her
home as the crow flies when it’s sober. It
was an unexpected act on his part, and it
took some time for the crowd to realise that
he had gone for the day and that all was
over. Then they began to press and squeeze
towards the gates. Once the cry went up,
“Here! he’s coining back!” and all hands
stretched their necks and looked back. But
it was only a bird hovering curiously on
the edge of a cloud bank, like the one Hawker
had once flown into. The crowd on the flat
was troublesome, and the mounted police had
to work hard to prevent an accident. As it
was, two women were booked for flights at
£2O apiece; but the mobbing made passen-
ger-carrying so dangerous that the two had
to toss for the get-away trip, for which they
both longed.
Dolores, who is bound for Maoriland,
steamed in and out of here in the N.D.L.
Zieten. In four months’ time she will be
“doing” Australia and delighting it with
song. The dimpled adorable woman, in order
to escape the publicity which it is the life-
work of the press-agent to supply, travels
under a name which must be almost as well
known as her platform one, so widely and
persistently has it been advertised. Oyi of
consideration for her, I am carefully omitting
it from this letter. The steamer was delayed
by labor troubles, and importunate friends
climbed the gangway of the ship on which
she was resting under her other name (I re-
fuse to mention what it is!) and shook Inn-
hand, and betrayed her in delighted shrieks
to the people to whose sea music she had
graciously listened undetected. Rough on the
singing and playing passengers, wasn’t it V
On Friday she had quite a big dinner-
party aboard, and the diners after-
wards stayed chatting on the deck in
the cool until midnight, when the
delaved boat cast off and backed away into
the moonlit bay. The white Belgian train-
ing-ship close by looked ghostly, and the
spars showed up against the distant blaze of
Luna Park. A travelled German close by
sighed, “Luna Park ! There is one even in
Jerusalem and mad Arabs shriek on the
scenic railway.” Dolores has still more
songs for the concert-haunter. She grows
not a day older in looks or spirit, and never
ceases to study or seek fresh material.
Tenor Paul Dufault is simply breathing
press and other incense in Maoriland. The
last. report shows that he was gravely re-
ceiving the homage of Christchurch—the
city the residents call “Choo Choo” and
scribble “Ch. Ch.”
Julius Knight now wears a feather in his
hat when doing the Block. It is only fair
to mention that it is not an ostrich feather.
It shows great self-restraint on his part, I
think. A sweeping ostrich plume is a
great temptation.
Stewart Dawson, the watch and jewel-
lery people, are said to have just paid
£85,000 for Nicholson’s Corner, at the
place where the Collins and Swanston streets
crowds bump into cine another on Saturday
mornings. Evidently there is money in
watches and gewgaws, in spite of the fact
that 17,963 shops in Melbourne divide
the trade. It is only 30 years ago since the
Stewart Dawson people fell into Melbourne
and started business with a staff of one man
and a bookkeeper boy in a small office up a
stairway in a part of Collins-street
that wasn’t of much consequence. Instead
of a shop-window for the public to put its
nose against, the Scotchman from Liverpool
plastered his advts. in the weekly papers
that got into the country ; and 25 years ago,
dropping into Melbourne on one of his perio-
dical tours among his branches, he
deserted the small office up the stairs
and brought a man from Maoriland to write
something new in signs on a little shop in
Swanston-street. And now the little shop
has swallowed the corner.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
While the thermometer has been registering- any-
thing. over a hundred, our departing Excellency has
been weltering in farewells. He began (piano) with
the Y.M.C.A. on Monday, and has worked through
factory inspectors, the Boy Scouts and Heaven knows
what to (fortissimo) the Adelaide Club’s dinner on
Friday night. On top of that he entertained the
Greys—Madam and the daughter for a few hours;
Monsieur for a few days—and has given his odd un-
occupied moments to the job of packing.
Beyond these items nothing much has transpired—-
except a record consumption of liquid refreshment
and a continued snarling between Mayor and military
over the civic entertainment of Sir lan Hamilton.
Also, it having been decided that the Glenelg railway
line shall be evicted from King William-street, a fresh
controversy has arisen as to what shall happen at
the Glenelg end of the rails. A proposal to build a
station immediately in front of some large and “de-
sirable” residences, effectually blocking their view of
the sea, has caused the owners to raise the person
who slew Abel. By the time Glenelg has decided
what it wants, steam suburban railways will be as
pre-historic as horse-trams.
Two South Australians of note have been snatched
from us—not by death, but by other States. Dr. F.
W. Wheatley left on Thursday for Melbourne, where
he is to instil' wisdom at the Naval College. He is
an old Prince Alfred College boy, who, after captur-
ing a degree or so at the Adelaide University, set
about teaching a few of the things he knew in Queens-
land and elsewhere. For the last couple of years he
has been at Oxford, where he earned the right to add
some more letters to his name. The other loss is
Dr. May Moffatt, who goes to Tasmania as Medical
Inspector of School Children.
The S.A. Yacht Squadron races, which occurred at
the Semaphore on Saturday, were patronised by the
Governor (guarded by Mr. Row), the E. W. Morrisses,
Miss Boothby, the Gifford Taits and various other
folk, who were more or less bored with the racing,
and more or less interested in one another —-and their
tea.
The Brighton Institute for the Blind, Deaf and
Dumb is richer by It 5000, an “anonymous” gift
having turned up by cheque (presumably signed by
someone) in an ordinary envelope, in the ordinary
way just as if it were a mere half-guinea. The
money is to be invested, and the committee rejoices
at the idea of having an extra £2OO or so a year to
spend.
Mrs. Charles Hasp, the Broken Hill millionairess,
whose first husband was a German boundary-rider
on Mount Gipps, isn’t to marry her Field-Marshal
Baron after all. No! the lady didn’t change her
mind. The change occurred in the other partv. He
put on immortality. After an illness of about five
weeks he died in London.
We won’t want as many new motor-cars this year.
The Govt. Statist a while ago promised us 19J
million bushels of wheat ; but now that the harvest
is in the bags there is less than 17 million bushels,
which means a poorer average than any time since
1904. Some suburbs are half-full of retired farmers
who have sold their grain-orchards on time-payment;
and on a still evening the air in those parts is full
of lamentations over unpaid instalments.
We very nearly had the new G.-G. Munro-Fergu-
son for our Governor once. It was early in 1895,
when Ivintore was quitting with his pockets full of
Broken Hill scrip, that Ferguson was offered, and,
it was cabled to us, accepted the local job; and
The Bulletin printed a picture of his knees pro-
truding from a swagger Highland costume. In those
days he was M.P. for Leith, having found a perch
after being very badly beaten by the Crofters’ man
in Ross-shire. But he was then much better known
as Rosebery’s- private secretary. However, he was
too rich or something, and at the last moment
wouldn’t come ; so we got the awfully dreary Fowell
Buxton instead.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
“The Elderly Bo’sun” pipes a piece:—
The naval base business has got a good deal mixed
since the Cook Government undertook to import an
alleged expert to elucidate it. So far, it seems to
be only Cockburn Sound that is giving trouble, but
the imported expert isn’t sure. No imported expert
ever is. This one now requires so much information
that he might as well have remained in the country
he came from for another year or so. By that time
the local experts who are expected to find the infor-
mation for him may be dead or the Cook Government
(as is more probable) will be out of a job, or it may
be found necessary to abandon some of the bases
tentatively chosen and choose others. As a matter
of fact, any decently good harbor, if it is deep
enough, will make a naval base, and any navigating
officer is quite competent to choose such a place.
When Pearce was Minister for Defence he talked
about getting a floating dock to begin with, which
would be much cheaper than a graving dock, and
could be taken where it was wanted to pick up a
wreck. Apparently it is not understood either by
Millen or his imported alleged expert, that floating
docks are part of the regular equipment of a modern
navy. It is more than 50 years since the two oldest
British dockyards at Woolwich and Deptford on the
Thames were abolished, and yet Chatham, Portsmouth
and Plymouth, which are all over 300 years old, are
still going strong, and each is quite unlike the other.
Chatham is miles up a river, with its dockyard on
a peninsula formed by a deep bend. Portsmouth, the
greatest of British dockyards, is on a low, naturally
swampy flat, its harbor formed by a lot of muddy
•creeks radiating from the entrance at Spithead. Both
Chatham and Portsmouth have their outer anchorages
at the Nore and Spithead. Plymouth is in quite a
different class. In the wars against France in the
18th century it, with Torbay, made a good base for
the fleets blockading Brest. Naval bases are of
many kinds, and there can be no fixed rulea for
estimating their value for any given purpose. Any-
how, as the racket we’re afraid of is likely to be
most strenuous away up North, what about making
some inquiries concerning a base thereabouts for the
overhauling of our ironclads when they crawl out
of the scrimmage?
It looks as though, if there were any
White JSlave traffic in Melbourne, quite a
number of that city’s girls would be only
too willing to don the shackles or whatever
other harness there may be. The police at
headquarters are weary of listening to the
tales of weepful damsels who call in late at
night to tell their troubles and borrow
enough to take them home. One and all
have been “mashed” by fascinating strangers
in the city or near the Central Station, and
have then gone for a stroll to the gardens
over Princes Bridge. They sat down ou
well-lighted lawns or rustic seats and they
bestowed their purses or handbags and hats
behind them or under the seat. Of course,
when they rose to go the purse or bag and
sometimes the hat too had disappeared. The
police have a fair idea of the “fascinating
strangers” against whom they would like to
lay charges of larceny, but the damsels
unanimously decline to appear if an arrest is
made; also they omit to state why they
didn’t take better care of their luggage. So
all the law can do is to issue a warning to
bare-headed damsels and let it go at that.
“A III.”: Though the offer of Tuta
Nahoniho to raise a Maori regiment for
service in S’Africa was turned down by the
British Government (B. 29/1/T4), a good
many Maoris and half-castes slipped into the
regiments which sailed from the Great Loan
Land. They took a considerable risk, too,
for the Boer showed little consideration to
colored men captured with arms. Ilenare
meant no more to him than Umslopogaas.
One big half-caste in the First Maorilanders
had a narrow escape at Sanna’s Post, where
de Wet smashed Broad wood’s column. Hav-
ing lost his horse and his rifle in the melee,
our brown brother was buried in thought
beside a Cape cart, the driver of which had
vanished, when the Dutchmen rode up. One
of them, taking him, in his filthy khaki, for
a “Cape Boy” of the transport, signed to
him to mount the cart and drive. He did
so, but at nightfall he informally resigned
his job and fled back to his battered regi-
ment.

BASKING IN HIS SMILE.
KING FAT: "Get up at once! What d'yer
mean by sprawling in front of us?”
WRETCH (leering horribly): “Ha! Your
Majesty also objects to sun-bathin’ !”
“One Mother”: —
“Mil” (B. 22/l/’l4) praises the administration
of the Aborigines Protection department of the North-
ern Territory, and declares there has been an im-
provement in the condition of the natives. Maybe;
but how does he justify the tearing away of young
children from their mothers, because they are half-
caste? Surely black mothers have some right to
their children? They have hearts the same as white
mothers. The Protectors even separate sisters. The
children are sent to mission stations or “adopted,”
to be brought up as servants to whites. This in the
name of Christianity and civilisation! I do not
think anything can justify such cruelty.
Presumably, in the name of Christianity and civilisa-
tion, “One Mother” would leave the partly-white off-
spring in the camp of the black mother of the
dubious character. Mothers have rights, certainly;
but so have children—the right to a fair chance, to
begin with.

“Te Babarantiko”: The Central and S.
Eastern Pacific islander is just as omnivorous a
feeder, as far as his limited resources permit, as his
brother of the Western Pacific, but, with rare excep-
tions, he is always willing to share his scanty fare
with the casual visitor or wayfarer. There is a
strict etiquette in these matters. The proffered food
can never be accepted off-hand. The visitor, when
the biscuit, bit of fish or taro is pushed over, must
always declare that he is “full,” and push it back.
Often the bits of food are pushed back and forth
over a dozen times, but the visitor always con-
cludes by eating it. It is not good form to ask for
food, although my friend Na Bua did it one day.
He appeared at my front door holding in each hand
a tin of “blown” salmon, with ends bulged out like
an importer’s turnrny. I recognised the tins as two
out of seven I had thrown into the lagoon, cursing
the dead loss on a case full. Did I want them ?
No. Could he have them? What for? To eat.
He could have them, but I advised him not to eat
the stuff. He made no comment, but pulled out his
knife. “Not here on my verandah!” I yelled. A
while later he reappeared showing every evidence of
having indulged in “blown” salmon, and asked
permission to build a fire. The salmon was not as
good as he could wish, but he thought it would go
better roasted. He, his wife, Nei Toratoa, and a
small boy waded through the seven tins of salmon,
and though I watched for signs of poisoning it
never incommoded them.

Dr. Mjoberg, the scientist who was sent
by the Swedish Government to interview Binghi
under his own gum-tree lately, in a letter to the
N.S.W. Linnaean Society, spoke a word on behalf of
that lonesome and vanishing person. The doctor,
regarding Binghi with the eye of a scientist, con-
siders him, as the representative of “one of the
oldest races on earth,” an interesting individual in
his native or untrousered condition, and opines that
the only way to keep him out of the uttermost tomb
is to keep him out of trousers. That is to say,
Binghi must be preserved from contact with white
brother, even white brother with the Bible. And
Mjoberg reckons he knows the very place for the
Purpose —Mornington Island, at the bottom end of
the Gulf of Carpentaria. It is 37 mil* long by 17
miles broad, and local Binghi has scarcely ever seen
white brother, and has no dreams of white brother’s
’bacca. Likewise, of white brother’s Bible and its
corollary, white brother’s rum, which is brown.
Mjoberg puts his plea forcibly:—
In the southern portion of the Continent they are
almost extinct. Only in the central and the inac-
cessible northern portions of Australia do they live
their true life, although even here the degeneration
has plainly spread, threatening them in the near
future with a similar fate to the aborigines of the
now civilised parts Only in one spot in Queens-
land, on Mornington Island, do the natives still live
untouched by white civilisation. They are living the
free and undisturbed life of their ancestors, governed
by their own unwritten laws and strict morals, the
latter even surpassing those of the whites. I do
not hesitate .to say that the establishment of a mis-
sion there will be the death-blow to the aborigines—■
that the hitherto happy blacks will be changed into
the same repelling and pitiable type which one
only too often observes in different parts of the con-
tinent. I ask, “Will this be permitted to happen
without a warning voice being raised? Is it not
wrong to thus degenerate the happy aborigines by
means of civilisation?”
Presumably, in order to get an answer to the ques-
tion, he wants Binghi to have a front seat on the
business paper at the next British Science Associa-
tion’s Congress.

“Marloo”: The published returns of the
herd-testing associations of Taranaki (M.L.) should
make the coastal dairymen of N.S.W., who are
almost prostrated by labor troubles,
sit up and take notice. The tests of
the Mangorei Ass. show that the
best and worst cows earned, respec-
tively, 555. 6d. and 9s. per month;
and as 13s. 6d. a month was the cost
of feeding a cow, it follows that you
could either make 425. or lose 4s. 6d.
per beast, according to the kind of
beast Strawberry happened to be. The
best milker tested by the Strathford
Ass. produced 53.821 b. of butter-fat
for the month, and the worst 9.121 b. ;
the best 10 cows averaged 42.811 b., and
the worst 10 only 14.331 b. a month.
In the case of the Midhurst Ass. the
best herd averaged 43.31 b., and
the worst 16.631 b. of fat. The best cow
gave 59.671 b., and the worst 5.41 b., while the average
was 28.671 b. The best 10 averaged 45.61 b., and
the worst 10 12.141 b. To the harassed dairyman
these figures give a hint as loud as a steam siren
or a politician’s wink to have the herd systemati-
cally tested, and to thereupon cast out the cherished
Strawberry if the figures prove the lady to be better
suited to the butchery than the ba'il.

“G. Back”: This is not a snake lie. It’s
a true one. It all happened in the course of a day’s
work in South Queensland. Writer one morning
killed a short, thick-set snake of a species unknown
to him. It resembled a death-adder, but was too
long for one. And it wasn t an adder, anyway.
Then he left per horse to help muster a paddock 10
miles off. Along the road he jumped down and slew
A RACING JOKE.
"Yes, sir, Ive ad the ' ardest luck. Lost me billet and got lumbago and parted from me
wife. Me cup of sorrow's bin full to overflowing!"
“ Yes, I know. A pewter cup , holding about a pint."
a black snake. A mile further along he rode over
a brown one that somebody else had slain. Arriving
at the paddock he found a sft. tiger serpent in pos-
session of the hut, and passed it the time of day.
'towards evening his dog unnecessarily pursued a
roo-rat. As the distance between them speedily
lessened, he became interested in the chase. But
suddenly and most mysteriously Bluey was snatched
from the course and went rolling and twirling in a
horizontal direction. When writer cantered up the
dog was struggling and yelping in the coils of a
carpet snake measuring about 12ft. Probably the
viper had reached for the flying rat and had secured
Bluey by accident. But I don’t know.

“Tyro”- “Leo Lear” (B. 22/l/’l4) thinks
the tubercular cow could be banished in no time
if all dairymen were compelled to house and hand-
feed. He’s wrong. The one cure is the tuberculin
test, with the axe or gun to follow. Many dairy-
men about Sydney keep their herds under the best
conditions, and still the diseased cow is common with
them. Not long ago the well-fed and
carefully-selected cows at Rookwood
Asylum were tested with tuberculin,
and badly-infected animals were found
among the best as well as the worst
conditioned in the mob. Some of the
poorest were acquitted, some of the
fattest were convicted. If condition
has anything to do with the disease,
why was this thus? Also, the infec-
tion of this fine herd could hardly
have come from “dried saliva left on
the grass by a sick cow,’’ as enough
grass for a cow to spit on, or a para-
site to roost on, is rarely seen in the
Rookwood paddocks. I don’t under-
stand “Leo Lear” when he says:
“You can’t breed cows for milk unless you
feed cows for milk also.” If he means that a cow
is a good, bad or indifferent milker according to
what she’s fed on, then “Leo” would be as big a
failure with cows as I am with paragraphs. A
moderate cow can’t be made good by any sort of
feeding—not if you handed her the whole bill of
fare, and told her to order any old thing she liked,
from the soup down to the toothpick.

“Marloo” : I reckon, for bush people, ours
is a champion musical family. Spend a night with
us, and you’ll know. Grandfather’s good on the
nasal organ. Grandmother’s always busy righting
the family discords. Father spends most of his time
wetting his whistle. Mother is continually harping
on the one string. Aunty is full of crochets and
quavers. Uncle is the champion hummer of the
town. Sam (he’s my brother) is mostly exercising
at the bars. The lodger or two we’ve had practised
the scale. As for me—well, they call me the lyre
of the family.
“lad”: At Wondalga, where the Tumut,
Batlow, Adelong and Tumberumba roads shake hands,
there are the tumbled remains of one of the wildest
of the old bush pubs of 60 years ago. It was built
in the time of the Adelong rush, when miners were
as thick along the banks of the Adelong and Wilson’s
creeks as rabbits are now. A dancing hall, to which
girls were brought from Victoria, was part of the
concern. It was common enough to see 100 horses
tied along the fence, while the owners danced with

A syllabus is to be formed for the aboriginal

the imported flirts, or bartered gold dust across the
counter. A few straggling trees and crumbling
bricks are all that remain. Tales of nuggets and

THE FOURTH DEGREE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Yesterday the Chief Commissioner of Police decided
to dismiss from the service Constable , of .
The decision is the outcome of an inquiry into a com-
plaint of a citizen, who alleged that had
assaulted him.— Melbourne Age.
The copper picked his quarry up and slammed him
down again
Upon the hard, unyielding road, and bounced him
thei and then
He pickc the blighter up and banged him on his
head once more,
Until the bouncing citizen saw fireworks by the score;
And, when the Keeper of the Peace had finished
with the cow,
He took him to the watchhouse with big lumps
upon his brow.
He took him to the watchhouse in a manner really
rough,
And, when his victim groaned awhile, he grunted
“That’s enough
Resistin’ th’ police is what we call your dashed
complaint.
A citizen with rights you-are? When you’re with
me, you ain’t!”
The poor bloke faintly bellowed “Help!”—but there
was none; and then
The duty-loving, zealous slop gave him some slops
again.
The copper dragged his prey into the watchhouse—
what was left
Of him —well past-protesting, both of speech and
wind bereft,
And impolitely sat him where the watch-house harvest
sits.
And the citizen just sat there, dumb, with cobwebs
on his wits.
He crouched there, cowed and coppered, just a bat-
tered human wreck,
Without a prayer to utter, feeling limply at his
neck.
The copper pulled his helmet off and wiped his
heated brow,
And took a breath or two, and at his victim shouted
“Now !’’
And to the sergeant he explained: “This feller stopped
an’ spoke
To me as if he thought I was —w’y, just an or’n’ry
bloke!
He ackshly stopped an’ arsked me for the time, an’
so”—■ “Quite right!”
The watch-house boss rejoined: “You’ve done yer
jooty well, this night! ”
Of course! When some obscure one words the cop
upon his beat,
Saying “Good-night” in passing by on sober midnight
feet,
Plainly, the cop’s clear duty is to show him who is
what,
And that the cop is anything but plain bloke—is
it not?
And, though slow courts may fine the dorg five bob,
or even ten,
The Fourth Degree is—shoulder-high, and slam-bang
down again!

“Machete”: The storm-bird or channel-
billed cuckoo has a much wider range than a recent
Bulletin correspondent gives him, for his raucous
whoop is heard all over Papua as well as Eastern
Australia. On the north-east coast of Papua, where
it rains regularly every afternoon, he is a correct
tipster, though in drier latitudes his name may be
Mud in this respect. I have often wondered why
the limits set on the migration of certain Papuan
fowls are so arbitrary. The storm-bird goes and
comes from the Australian mainland as he likes.
Yet the Papuan horn-bill, a much stronger flier
and a great wanderer, never takes his Hebrew beak
across the Str.aits. The wingless cassowary is found
on both sides' of the water, like the white cockatoos
and many parrots ; yet a common Island parrot tribe,
the males of which are scarlet and blue, while the
ladies are plain green, never by any chance visits Aus-
tralia, though it ranges all through the Solomons
and the islands north of Papua. Again, the goura
pigeon is common on the N.E. coast of Papda up to
the Musa River; but past that you never get him,
though the stream is so narrow that he could kick
his wife across it, if he felt that way.
ONE BRUTE AND ANOTHER.
SHE ( romantically): “Oh, George darling!
Supposing the lion broke loose, whom would
you endeavor to save first —me or our
child?”
GEORGE ( laconically): “Me! ”
‘Pick’: “Sumach” (B. 9/10/’l3) backs
the crow for cowardice. I entertain just the oppo-
site opinion of the Satanic fowl. He has the bump
of self-preservation well developed, and hates being
about when anyone is fooling with a gun, I’ll admit.
Yet I have seen him attack almost all animals, from
the horse downwards, and, as for other birds, there
are few that don’t give him room when he is out on
the razzle. Personally, I was once fool enough to
climb up to a crow’s nest, and the reception I got
from the wedded couple was all I wanted. Years
later I had a lot of sympathy for Tommy Burns
when J. Johnson knocked him out. I’d met a couple
of niggers myself, and I knew what it felt like.
BY WAY OF ARGUMENT.
C OUNSEL: "You say your wife raised objections to you
staying out at night?”
WITNESS: “She did. She raised the poker , a couple o' flat
irons , an' ’arf a brick."
“Taff”: Up here in the North Ah Fong
looms large as a producer of maize and potatoes,
and in marketing his goods he has nothing to learn
from Sussex-street. A few years ago the pursuit
of a crust ‘ carried me to Atherton
(Queensland). Purchases of maize
being made at the farms, it always
took a few days to get delivery at
the railway station, and if during the
interval the market advanced it was
guineas to gooseberries there would be
no delivery, or the sample offered
would be much inferior to that
originally submitted. The excuses of
Johnnie were endless. “Horse he very
sick, he no go” ; “Cart he break down,
no can get in” ; were two of the stock
lies. Threatened with law, Ah Fong
would vanish to another farm, and all
inquiries at his humpy would elicit:
“No savee, boss he no home.” The
Chinese potato-growers at Townsville
also worked a sweet joke. The crop
had turned out unsatisfactory, many
of the tubers being very small, and
therefore unsaleable. Buyers insisted, of
course, on the large variety. On
examination, the middle of every bag
was found to contain about 201 b. of
humble trash. Making a tour of in-
spection, I found one of the subtle
heathens working the swindle. He
first put a foundation of good mur-
phies in the bottom of the bag, and
then inserted a kerosene tin with
both ends cut out. After packing around
the tin with good potatoes, he filled the
tin with the rejected spuds, withdrew
it, and topped off with the pick of his
crop. Of course that swindle was
workable for one year only; but
Johnnie knows more than one swindle,
so he isn’t downhearted. Why should
he be? China has lasted 5000 years
or more, and the bottomless decep-
tion of it's pigtail hasn’t been fully
expounded yet.
‘Tiaki”: I think I know why the crowd
which buttons its collar at the base of its skull per-
sistently decries the skimpiness of the garments with
which Eve clothes herself. It is because the person
who fixes his collar aft has seen too little of Eve.
Years ago we used to watch mixed parties of 40 or
more Maoris bathing together. Meri would glide
into the water, and as she stooped down her last
garment would be drawn up over her head and flung
on shore, and her body would be hidden beneath the
waters. I never saw or heard anything indecent at
these swimming carnivals. I never heard young
Henare make any comment then on the quality of
Meri’s understandings or figure. But now that
Meri has taken to hiding her once free striding
limbs beneath a costume or hobble, it is no uncom-
mon thing to hear Henare of the cigarette and
straw hat variety commenting on the small portion
of Meri’s brown ankle which shows through the open-
work hose. And I’m quite sure that Meri who
wore the invisible bathing costume was as virtuous
in mind and body as the present-day Meri in the
tailor-made.
The Meat Trust: An Ounce of Theory
and a Ton of Practice.
With the coming of the American Beef
i rust to Australia, now a generally ad-
mitted fact, there seems to be a remarkable
disposition in some parts to close eyes to the
obvious, and hail the octopus as a benevo-
lent beast in spite of what has happened
where it has already got to business. Thus
Dalgety’s Review, a journal naturally de-
voted to the interests of the stockowner and
those connected with him commercially,
after pointing out the importance which the
meat industries are assuming in Queensland
(it is anticipated that the year will be a
record for trade done, and, with sundry pro-
ducts, that the industry will be worth “con-
siderably over £3,000,000”), complacently
remarks: —
Tlie idea held in some commercial circles that the
American company, shortly to commence its opera-
tions in Brisbane, will become an Aaron's rod to
swallow up all the others; that ultimately it will
buy up all the existing companies, and control the
whole of the marketable stock and export trade, Is
only realisable if there should not be sufficient energy
and enterprise in the present companies and stock
pioducers to compete with this invading company,
and to conserve their own interests in the market.
It would be unfortunate if this were to take place.
But all industries are open to competition, which is
the natural stimulus to work and trade, and from
which no profitable occupation can escape. The en-
trance of this company into the field ought to mean
only another competitor to be met and contended
with, and so should give a fresh impetus to the
industry in all its branches. It will naturally
increase the opportunities of the stockowners for the
sale of their stock, and quicken the activities of
the export trade. And this should be the
result. Probably, this threatened disturbance of the
customary routine of supply and demand may awaken
the State to see the great possibilities it possesses
of producing much larger meat supplies for the
world s market. Queenslanders, with 'British @pital
at their backs, ought not to be swamped out of exist-
ence in their own country.
By way of contrast, here is an extract firom
the Buenos Ayres Herald :
There has been such an astonishing belief in the
vastness of the Argentine territory and the difficulty
of obtaining anything approaching exclusive control
ot its resources, that even a month ago, in London,
the representatives df the companies most affected
by the Trust loudly declared that it was impossible
tor such an organisation to succeeds The logic of facts
however, is unanswerable, and we saw, on Saturdav
last, a frank admission by the majority of the firms
interested in the export of beef to England that the
state of affairs had now arrived at such a pitch that
urdess the Government could suggest some manner
of dealing with the difficulty, all the freezing estab-
hshments, except those belonging to the Trust, would
have to close. Shipments of beef for the last month
or two from America to England have been sold at a
loss of from 30 to 45 dollars per head. This can
only be done with a view to securing a monopoly of
the meat trade. Only an association with very des-
pci ate intentions could venture upon a business in-
volving such enormous losses as those which are ad-
mitted to be sustained by the frozen meat exporters
at the present moment. The only possible object
CO .V, , e freeze out all the companies competing
with the Trust, in order that the latter might have
the monopoly of Argentine trade. A Trust with
enormous capital behind it can afford to work at a
loss for a considerable time, when it has the confi-
dence that its competitors have no such unlimited
backing, and that once they are eliminated the lo«i
sustained during the struggle can be amply compen-
sated m the future. The proceedings of the Trust
in America are well known, and this is not a ques-
tion between the Americans and the British: it is a
question between fair and foul trading. It will be
a sorry day for Argentina if legitimate traders are
to be liable to be squeezed out of existence by
associations which are immoral in every commercial
sense of the term.
reason have we to expect that things
will be in any way different in Australia?
The Argentine companies were strong;
backed up, many of them, by British capi-
tal, they were on the whole vastly stronger
than those of Australia against which the
Trust will find itself in competition. Yet,
atter actual experience, even the Argentine
competitors of the vast Yankee combine
mid the struggle hopeless; and now that it
is too late there is a plaintive cry that “un-
less the Government can suggest some way”
to save the trade after it has been lost, “all
the freezing establishments, except those be-
longing to the Trust, will have to close.”
And the Argentine is not such a fool as to
pretend not to know what that means. The
Trust doesn’t at great cost get the field to
itself for nothing. It is out to make money
out to control both markets; out to re-
duce the buying price to the lowest possible
penny and to raise the selling price to the
uttermost possible farthing. What mad-
ness is it for Australia to assume that its
own experience will differ from that of
every other country into which the monster
has spread itself!

Tree-planting by Prison Labor.
Herewith “Norbell’s” rejoinder, and this
exhausts the subject:—
In the matter of “Lux” v. the Holman Govern-
ment on the question of afforestation by prison
labor, I regret that my learned friend has nothing
new to adduce. He repeats his former statement
that tree-planting by prison labor is a vain thing,
liable to sap the morals of the prisoner, leaving him
to lace an unfeeling world utterly unable to earn
his living honestly. Again, “Lex’' asserts that the
present prison system of N.S.W. teaches the prisoner
a useful trade, and turns him out, when his time is
up, fully equipped to earn an honest living. He
emphasises once more the perfection of N.S.W. prison
discipline, and proves that it is without fault or
flaw, by citing the fact that the criminal population
is annually decreasing in his thrice-blessed State.
Also he reiterates the statement that the afforesta-
tion scheme in Maoriland is a failure, “a notoriously
uneconomical” and “ethically pernicious failure.”
Permit me now to reassert my assertion that no
prisoner in the gaols of N.S.W. is ever taught a
trade sufficiently well to enable him to earn a bare
subsistence, let alone a decent living, in free com-
petition with the skilled but unconvicted artisan
outside. Even the Director of Prison Labor, whose
report I quoted, and who might reasonably be sup-
posed to have a partiality for liis own system, admits
the hopelessness of expecting the prison-taught
tradesman to earn a living at his trade on his re-
lease. “Official figures go to show,” says “Lex,”
that the majority of the men take to those (gaol-
taught) trades on their release, and thereafter main-
tain themselves and their families by them ” I
would challenge “Lex” to produce those incontest-
able official figures,” only I am assured that no
such official figures exist.
tvt i/,,, Lhc , efficac y> not to say perfection, of the
JN.S.W. prison system is to be deduced from the
decline of the prison population in N.S.W., what
about Maoriland ? Does not the same touchstone
apply there? The latest published statistics (“Offi-
cial Year-Book,” 1912) inform me as follows:
charges before magistrates in the year
19°7 were 40.09 per 1000 of the mean population:
in 1911, only 37.54 per 1000. In 1907, the sum-
mary convictions were 33.14 per 1000, as against
31.56 in 1911. In the superior courts 450 convic-
hons were recorded in 1907 (there were as many
ln iin 1911 there were 403. At
the end of 1906 there were 891 prisoners in Maori-
land gaols; at the end of 1911 there were 873. It
therefore follows, by “Lex's” own reasoning, that
the ethically pernicious” Maoriland system has
brought about a marked diminution of crime It
would thus almost seem as if “Lex,” in sternly re-
proving sentimentality, had fallen into misleading
sensationalism.
When this afforestation idea was first mooted
here by the Holman Government, it was expressly
laid down that the prisoners to be employed at the
tree-planting camps should be very carefullv-selected
first offenders; yet “Lex” asserts that the work
will involve the association of criminals of all de-
grees of villainy. If, as he asserts, there is an
entirely different class of offender at Bathurst Gaol
from that of Parramatta Gaol, and the “apparently
penitent are kept out of touch as much as possible
with the palpably incorrigible,” why not cull the
first tree-planting gang from the A 1 Bathurst Pen
of the Apparently Penitent, and leave the “palpably
incorrigible to learn the useful and reforming trade
of making doormats?
. accuses me of inaccuracies, and cites the
tact that I had supposed Darlinghurst to be one of
the gaols where trades were taught. I admit the
error if it be one; but I was guided by the official
report. For the rest, I assure my learned friend
that T am fully aware that “separate treatment”
and soutary confinement” are two different things
to the official mind, the latter being the term applied
solely to punishment for breaches of prison disci-
pline; but I have a very strong belief that “Lex”
knows well that “separate treatment,” so called,
means something much more severe than the two
words suggest.
Finally, I am still wedded to the opinion that
afforestation, or re-afforestation, by prison labor is
a good thing for the State and for the law-breaker.
The healthful camp life must be beneficial to the
prisoner. It should make him physically better
able to .start life again on his release than if he
were pottering about in the matmakers’ shops in
Parramatta Gaol. And on top of all is the incon-
testable fact that every tree planted is an asset for
the future. If the Maoriland scheme is an economic
failure it has certainly caused millions of sturdv
young trees to grow there, and one day they will
be of greater value to the country than a pile of
prison-made boots and doormats as high as Mount
Ngauruhoe.
FAILURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is something in driving-rain that has a
peculiarly vivifying effect upon woman’s capacity for
amorous emotion.— I “Red Page” extract from a recent
book on love, and women, and things.
Her simple name is Mary Ann.
I thought that vulgar once, maybe;
Now from Be-ersheba to Dan
No fairer name exists for me.
Her eyes are just the sweetest things—
Their color yet I have not guessed.
Hqr hair like golden ardor clings
About a face which I attest
Is lovelier than the loveliest.
One fault alone she has, and this
Is greater than a score might be—
She has all virtues and each bliss,
But yet the vixen won’t love me.
I’ve tried my best to stir her heart;
I give her all things seeming fit
A spacious pleasure to impart.
Love's labor’s lost and all his wit—
She doesh’t seem to notice it.
So when I read that in the rain
k A maid of stone might tender grow,
To soften Mary’s callous vein,
I dragged her gaily to and fro
When fell the clouds in thunder down,
And raging seas and rivers met.
There was a chance that she might drown,
But nought of comfort have I yet.
Alas! I only “got her wet.”
VICTORIA.

A New Lease of Health.
“ The wonders brought about by this
preparation are no less manifold than
amazing.”
So writes a well-known physician in
the Medical Press and Circular one
of sixteen thousand doctors who have
testified to the value of Sanatogen in
various kinds of weakness, loss of nerve-
power, impaired digestion, brain-fag,
sleeplessness, and general weakness.
Sanatogen, the tonic food with lasting
effects, has given a new lease of health
to more than a million sufferers, in r
cludingjnany of the most distinguished
people m the land.
Nerve Power Restored.
The reason for Sanatogen’s great
efficacy in nervous disorders has been
pointed out by no less an authority than
Sir Charles A. Cameron, C. 8., M.D.,
Public Analyst of Dublin, who states:
“ Sanatogen is an excellent nerve food,
containing a large amount of organic
phosphorus in exactly the form in which
it can be easily absorbed.”
But Sanatogen does more than revivify
the nervous system. It also builds up
the muscular tissues and has a beneficial
effect upon every organ of the bod}%
Write for a Free Booklet.
All who feel run down, weary and
depressed—Nature’s warning of nervous
weakness —should write to-day for a Free
Booklet, “ The Art of Diving,” to Messrs.
A. Wulfing & Co., 17, Bond Street,
Sydney, N.S.W. Kindly mention this
paper when writing.
Sanatogen is sold by all Chemists,
price 2s. 6d., 3s. 6d., and 6s. 6d. per tin.
u I have watched the effects of Sanatogen upon persons suffering
from various kinds of weakness and loss of nerve-power, and I
have proved it to be most valuable.” —Lady Henry Somerset.
“R. 8.”: The new Oxford movement to
’purify the English language is to turn its
attention first to “those natives of London
( and Essex who call a lady a lydy,” and it
js suggested that Australia should be in-
Icluded. But who expects correct pronun-
ciation of uneducated, book-ignorant and
‘therefore language-ignorant people? The
“movement” might better begin moving at
“Awxfud” and “Caimbwidg,” and after it
lias learned to march it should make for the
West End and correct the shocking speech
of the naicest people. Here is a little list
of West End errors:—“Naitchah” for
“nature”; “A” for “I” ; “may dair” for “my
dear”; “whair” for “where”; “quayet” for
“quiet”; “sleep-ah” for “sleeper”; “whay”
for “why”; “wiah” for “wire” ; “taime” for
“time”; “plaice” for “place”; “gyerl” for
“girl”; “mastah” for “master”; “happay”
for “happy” ; “umpiah” for “empire” ; “pur
his yers” for “pull his ears”; “taired” for
“tired” ; “chay-ar” for “chair” ; “Injur” for
India” ; “audjins” for “audience” ; “Heah !
Heah!” or “Yer! Yer!” for “Hear! Hear!!’
They drop the terminal “g,” too, and “rip-
pin’ ” is used as an adjective implying
merit; while the superlatives of “beauty” ex-
haust themselves in “Top-hole—what?” The
worst English on earth is spoken in London
by the people who feel annoyed in Paris
because their Kensington French cannot get
itself understood.
“Armes” : The most important recent de-
velopment in the Australian National Army
is in connection with “wireless” signalling.
As I write it is being practised by over 500
signallers at Heidelberg, near Melbourne.
Every Light Horse and Infantry regiment
has sent representatives. The Signalling
Corps, as a separate unit, consists of 160
officers and men, a good enough staff for a
school of instruction. Major Rossitor, w r ho
commands, finds in general great eagerness
to learn the new trick ; and indeed it is the
most delightful thing in the military experi-
ence of most of the 500. Armed with this,
see how a commander-in-chief, in the field,
will be able to handle his army. Even
modern Moltke never dreamt of such possi-
bilities. It is only a little less wonderful
than the handling of naval forces in a battle
controlled from the Admiralty Qffice.
Mounted despatch messengers will almost
disappear. The portable field stations have
a range of 20 miles. The poles, of course,
are jointed, and easily shifted. The weight
lies in the engine—-1601b. The cost of each
set is £625. So the money goes. One
trouble may be found in what is called
“jamming” ; that is to say, the enemy may
fill the air with clashing air-waves, so that in-
telligent communication between the sections
of an army may be difficult—even impossible.
Thus the Heidelberg camp picked up a mes-
sage from the steamer Orvieto, out at sea;
and while it was picking that up it couldn’t,
of course, pick up anything else.
“Thank Yer, Sir”: An Australian busi-
ness man who has just returned from a
round-the-world tour showed me the Italian
brigand’s notice reproduced below. He said
he didn’t want to go travelling any more in
low-wage countries, where the waiter and
the porter and the chambermaid had to bush-
range the hotel guests in order to make a
living. After tipping everybody in Eng-
land, bar George and Mary, the Lord Chief
Justice and a few others, he passed over to
help Europe along, and did his duty faith-
fully until h'e found this in his hotel bed-
room at Milan:—

That stung the free Australian citizen so
badly that he risked a«sassination by being
as mean as J. I). Rockefeller while he was
about the premises. You can’t get that man
to say a word against high wages. He has
seen the European working-man crawling
for the extra tuppence, and spitting when
fip didn’t get it, and he greatly prefers the
Australian variety who strikes occasionally
and never gets under your feet.
The Northern Territory, from the stand-
point of the plain bloke :
Port Darwin and the little towns one runs into on
the Pine Creek line possess points of interest and
amusement that few other parts of the Commonwealth
can show. I don’t intend to say anything about
the splendid climate, the prolific soil or the evident
mineral wealth of the country; all these things
have been told of before. What struck me first and
most forcibly was the way liquor was consumed, but
that was perhaps because I am a novice, falling asleep
as early us 2 a.m., thus losing two clear hours
hard drinking. Item: Dodge sam-su and “square.”
Both are guaranteed to make you empty devils out
of your boots for a week after leaving off. Sam-su
is a Chinese drink made from rice. It smells like
raw bailiff, and tastes like fried conscience and
brimstone. Oblong bottles, square bottles, round
bottles, queer shaped bottles and just bottles are to
be seen in heaps everywhere; monuments of bygone
sprees. One more feature of Darwin that impresses
the new arrival is the astonishing number of Govern-
ment officials. Clad in white boots, Panama hats
and white suits, they swarm on the landscape. As
a drunk Methodist said: “They toil not, neither do
they spin, yet Trumper in all his glory was not
clad as one of these.” There are superintendents
who don’t superintend; directors who don’t direct,
and other officials who don’t fish.
The local train runs twice weekly, and carries
more “deadheads” to the square yard than any
Domain figtree.
If any information is wanted about the back coun-
try, Darwin Government offices are the wrong places
to seek it. Rather wander round the pubs and inter-
view the men who have been on the spot.
The mining industry is not getting the attention
which it deserves; rather the reverse. There are
several mines shut down with valuable machinery on
their leases. It seems to be the policy of the Mines
Department to tear this machinery up and ship it
out of the country. I myself have been engaged in
this work of destruction. The railway line seems to
be just as far off as ever. One unduly impatient
inhabitant says that if he could get a bottle of
“square” every day till they start operations his
descendants could live and die drunk even unto the
sixth generation.
Each boat brings fresh arrivals, and the next
takes most of them away. A lot of them are from
the cities, and have the idea that the Territory is a
place where you wear white suits and tennis shoes,
and watch blaclcfellows work. When they are handed
the same old pick, shovel or axe their departure is
hurried and uncompromising.
The Territory is not the place for a man whose
only assets are his thick skull and brute strength ;
at ieast under present conditions. There are too many
of us hete now.
For a White Australian, Darwin is not the place
to come to to see his theory in practice. Stores,
laundries, etc., all carry good old Australian names
such as Yet Toong, Man Fong Tan, and so on. Even
the Government officials, hotels and boarding-houses
employ colored labor. Most plain blokes are of the
opinion that the Government officials should not
employ colored labor either in their departments
or in their homes. But, then, plain blokes don’t
count when opinions are being collected about the
Territory-—especially by the Cook Government; like-
wise the Labor Government; ditto any other old
Government.
The Glenelg railway, which Richard
Butler last year promised to have “out of
King William-street by Christmas” (loud
cheering), still lumbers the southern one-
third of Adelaide’s mile-long chief street.
The Minister for Works 1 they call all these
Ministers “Commissioners” in S. Aus.) now
suggests April as a likely time. All pas-
sengers will then be turned out on
South Terrace, but franked for a tram-ride
to the Queen’s statue, which is a little
nearer the heart of the city than the present
terminus. Doubts are, however, expressed
as to whether the tramway service can
handle whole trainloads of patronage thrown
at* it in lumps at short intervals. Sydney
does it, of course, more or less badly; and
the trams at Mosman handle whole boat-
loads more or less horribly—and a Mosman
boat-load is as large as a Glenelg train-load
any day. But it will mean some extra bump-
ing and racketing and swearing; and when
all is said and done, the new system will
probably kill and maim three times as many
people as the old train. But the train that
crawls up a wide, quiet street has been
laughed at so often that Adelaide blushes
every time the thing is mentioned; and it
will neglect a lot of more urgent things to
abolish an old institution and drop its rail-
way passengers out on the very edge of the
city.
A party of Sydney shark fishers lately
played it low down on a seaside boarding-
house keeper. The hash-tower warden, in
the interests of business, had written a let-
ter to Sydney Sun, contradicting a previous
report that there were herds of sharks wait-
ing for the summer bather in the waters ad-
jacent to the hashery. The shark hunters
thereupon organised a Sunday expedition,
journeyed up to the resort, and, hiring a
strong launch (they weren’t going to risk
their lives in the ordinary row-boat) caught
seven man-eaters within an hour, without
once shifting their moorings. The brutes
ranged from 12ft. to 16ft. in length, and
each of them thrashed the surface like the
propeller of an empty freight steamer. Then
the weary crew rubbed balm on their blis-
tered hands and wrote to the Sun record-
ing their horrifying catch of 30 yards or so of
sea-death in the place where the summer
visitor is urged (by advertisement) to come
and bathe in peace with his wife and family.
Nothing has since been heard of the hash-
tower warden ; he or she is as silent as last
pight’s stew.
On this year’s Anniversary Day the grand-
sons of “the pioneers” got back to their fore-
fathers’ way of doing it, and wound up with
a feed. The first man to strike the brilliant
idea of celebrating the birth of a nation by
eating something was Isaac Nichols, Syd-
ney’s first postmaster, away back in 1817.
The dinner was held in the house where
Nichols lived and took in the mails, at the
corner of George-street and Circular Quay,
where the fire station now stands. The
postmaster issued invitations to about 40
guests, who sat down to the tucker at 5
p.m., and did not rise till 10. It was after
this dinner that an afterwards well-known
song, composed for the occasion, was sung.
One verse:—
When first Australia rose to fame,
And seamen brave explored her shores,
Neptune with joy beheld their aim ;
And thus expressed the wish he bore;
Rise, Australia, with peace and plenty crown’d,
Thy name shall one day be renown’d ;
Then commerce, too, will on thee smile,
Adventurous barks thy port shall crowd,
While pleased, well pleased, the parent Isle
Shall of her distant sons be proud.
The dinner was such a success that for
some years it was an annual event; but if
any other original songs were sung to the
fed they haven’t been handed down as worth
repeating.
THE ONLY REMEDY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I beat her because she deserved it. She has a
horrible tongue at times, and the beating did her
good.— Convicted but courageous wife-beater , on
being remonstrated with over the back fence by a
deputation of neighbors.
Because of the devil that lives in her mouth and
the dust-storm she calls her brain,
I cut me a length of the red-gum tree and I wal-
loped her well again.
I walloped her well with the door closed tight, and
she yelled till her voice gave out.
Though she called me “Murderer!” “Wretch!” and
“Beast!”
I knew that she didn’t mind in the least
And was grateful for every clout.
She contradicted, she nagged and snarled through
the whole of a blinding day,
And I knew very well she wouldn’t stop if I gave
her her own sweet way;
She bid like a hell-cat for what she got, and I knew
as she blubbered there,
That she felt a hiding would do her good,
So I gave her good measure of muscle and wood,
And I think that I acted fair.
There’s many a woman and many a maid with a
fiend where a tongue should be,
And I know very well what I would do if they only
belonged to me;
I’d wallop them well when they needed it —which
they do about once a day.
And I wouldn’t knock off if next door cried
“Shame!”
For a maid and a wife are just the same
And the stick is the only way.
But the sour old maid who is not so old is the one
I would like to fix;
For the venom is thick on her envious tongue and
she’s never done with her tricks;
I’d wallop her well for the good of her soul (which
has lost all its maiden sheen) —
Yes, I’d wallop her well in a friendly way,
Till she hadn’t a poisonous word to say
And her mind was fresh and clean.

By the Oldest Inhabitant.
February 6 was the 63rd anniversary of Black
Thursday, a day still remembered by hands
as a visitation from Hades, and to-d y OStW
SS hSSSK.' It fed n. s. iv.le ? . The next
night a great anti-transportation tea-meetmg was he
in St. Patrick’s Hall, Bourke-street, Melbourne.
The Sydney Telegraph hankers horribly
after its nigger. In a recent article on the
Territory it deplored that the white man—
with practically no railways and hardly any-
thing else to help him —hadn t farmed that
huge pastoral country; and it added that a
report’’ showed white labor to be 20 per cent,
less efficient up North than in Sydney. \\ hat
report ? And who made the report. And was
the reporter talking of the Territory in gen-
eral or the low-lying scrap where Darwin is
situated? Also was he talking through Ins
belltopper ?
Gilruth, the horse doctor who has charge
of that ill-treated steed, the Northern Terri-
tory. is going down to Melbourne to see the
Minister for External Affairs or Infernal
Nuisances. Although no one seems to know
definitely what the visit is for. there is an
impression that the groom of the wilderness
is going down to have a consultation with
the remote and inexperienced trainer and
decide how best they can save a little money
<>n the .poor brute’s feed. What is really
required is that the Territory’s present poli-
tical owners should be treated for blind
railway staggers, parliamentary roaring and
the greasy heel of opportunism. If Gilruth
is a really courageous horse-physician and
knows his job, he will recommend some such
course of treatment without delay.
A brief extract from an interview with the
president of the Sydney Wharf Laborers’
Union in a recent Saturday’s paper : —
He proceeded to sly that if the workers Stood
solidly the whole world over the working class
would win their battle, and receive for the first time
the full, result of their labor.
Surely not quite for the first time ! Leaving
out such cases as those of Adam and Noah
and Robinson Crusoe, there were our ances-
tors, the cave men, who paid no rent nor
interest nor taxes nor patent fees nor royal-
ties, nor any other exactions. Some people
reckon that the worker got the full result
of his labor during quite a large section of
the world’s histoyy—or want of history.
Then there are the Eskimo and other casual
examples to-day. And to come down to real
business and instances closer to hand, there
was New Australia, in Paraguay, where the
worker got even more than the full result of
his labor, for the colony did the parasite act
On a very poor colored community for free
land, and also cadged on a very dead-broke
Government for cash assistance. Also, there
was the Daily Post in Sydney, on which
the worker got the full result of his labor,
and the end was such utter insolvency
that the ill-paid and dreadfully-overworked
editor was diddled out of a great deal of his
salary. Labor’s weak point always lay in
its reluctance to pay the price of the best
brains to manage the job, and its refusal to
give anything like a free hand to the brains
it purchased. And as a result, there have
been a good many occasions when the toiler
got “the full result of his labor,’’ and found
it was less than he received when he only
got part of the result. Badly directed or ill-
organised labor, or labor that struggles along
with antiquated appliances (which is much
the same thing) may put in a heap of honest
endeavor and hardly earn adequate beer.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Age surmises that Gov.-Gen. Den-
man’s break-down is due in no small measure
to the worry and difficulty of dealing with
John Bull “while six independent State vice-
roys have his ear.” Poor Bull —seven Aus-
tralian governors clamoring at one ear,
while seven Australian treasurers bite the
other!
The appointment by the N.S.W. Govern-
ment of one of its members—Flowers,
M.L.C.—to a salaried billet as President of
the Board of Fire Commissioners is an un-
usual departure. Plenty of Ministers have
glode gently out of the Cabinet and then
taken salaried jobs. Some have strained
the public conscience by making quite
sure of the salaried jobs before quitting the
Cabinet. But to take the salaried job and
yet stay in the Cabinet is rather extra, so
to speak. Some people would say it was
more than extra.
GUBERNATORIAL UNREST.—A
WARANING.
Now that the appointment of a successor to Lord
Denman as Governor-General of Australia. . . .the im-
pression caused by the recent eviction cannot have
had other than an unfortunate effect in the circles
from which Governors-General are selected.
—Sydney Telegraph grimly.
Our morbid artist endeavors to picture the
positively horrid slate of affairs which might
eventuate should all the best families at
“Home ” be goaded into more drastic action by
the ungracious behavior of our—haw !—
colonial legislators !
Tfl e announcement last week that plain
Munro Ferguson might be the next Governor-
General finished, of course, with the assur-
ance that he would be made a peer before
exportation. These peers are a weariness.
When Parliament meets, the Senate majority
might do some good work by resolving that
this country wants a Governor-General
named Mr. William Smith or Mr. Samuel
Bowler.
According to Riley, M.H.R., reported by
the Sydney Telegraph, Bobbie Burns wrote
that “rank is but the penny stamp, a man’s
a man for a’ that.” “I am pleased to say,”
said Riley, “that Burns is often quoted in
the Federal Parliament. His words help us
greatly in that they enable us to express the
correct thing.” As a matter of fact, Burns
was referring to the borrowing N.S.W.
Labor party, and really wrote: “Our policy’s
a penny stamp—we ‘stick it up’ for a’ that.”

fought for the distinction of being the most
pawned State on earth in proportion to popu-
lation. Now Westralia, under the Scaddan
Government, has won in a canter. Last
financial year it borrowed at the rate of
£ll 2s. Bd. per inhabitant. So it is getting on
gaily towards a liability of £lOO per human,
including the oldest inhabitant and the
baby; and all its rivals toil amid the dust
cloud in the rear with the dogs running after
them and barking in mockery.
ROUGH ON
THE EAR.
The Governor-General is a Governor-General in
name only. He is merely one of seven independent
Viceroys, nil of whom have the ear of the King.
—Melh. AGE, 27/l/’l4.
The great art of thankfulness for small
mercies, being an extract from a recent S. M.
Herald leader: —
We are glad that both the Prime Minister and the
Minister for Defence have during the last few days
emphasised the importance of proceeding with the
work of defence in Australia UNFLINCHINGLY....
The Australian people have resolved to see this thing
through.
It is very good of Joe Cook to be so
darned unflinchingly in defence of a policy
which he treated, as long as he
dared, with scorn and loathing and
abuse. The Federal Labor Party carried
the defence scheme amidst the breakage of
the heart of Joseph and the horror of
Joseph’s associates. Now Joseph finds that
it has come to stay, and he is unflinching—
with his jaw anyhow—in its support. He is
the sort of leader who has to be dragged be-
hind the vehicle at the end of a rope until
the destination is reached. Then he proudly
takes his place in front and looks as if he had
been hauling the carriage all the time.
From Canberra, the Federal capital site
of a young nation that had a million places
to pick from :
This decayed village of mean shacks called Quean-
beyan has taken on a new life since the advent of
the Federal capital by supplying the toilers with
life s necessaries at 50 per cent, on city prices. It
likewise empties the village offal in the dreary trickle
which sometimes meanders past its untidy back door,
and which the misguided map, with rare enthusiasm,
calls a river. The inhabitants of the village indulge
but little in the pagan habit of bathing ; and as the
water isn’t fit to drink they mostly don’t mind it
not being laid on. The sanitary arrangements can be
smelt for miles; and the mighty Molonglo, from
which the eaoital of a continent is to draw its
water, is so dried up you can walk across it in a
dozen places, and in the other places it smells almost
as bad as the sanitary system.
Is the Sydney wharf-laboring profession
hopelessly overcrowded, or what is wrong?
The wages are Is. 6d. per hour in ordinary
working time and 2s. 3d. for overtime, and
most of the hours of the 24 are overtime.
Yet it is solemnly alleged by an ex-president
of the union and other persons who ought to
know, that the average earnings are between
2bs. and 30s. per week. If plain time and
overtime are lumped together at Is. 9d. per
hour that means 16 or 161 hours work a
week as a steady thing. The demand for an
increase is based on the alleged inadequate
results under the present scale, to which the
shipowners reply by alleging that the absurd
numerousness of the men is the trouble, and
that no wage they can afford to pay would
keep them all in comfort. By way of re-
joinder, a good deal is said about the loss of
time while waiting for jobs owing to the
casual habits of ships. At a recent wharf-
labor meeting it is alleged that 3500 members
of the union attended, which seems a tre-
mendous lot at one meeting, but still Sydney
is a whale for commerce. An independent
investigation of this matter should be inter-
esting.
. A persistent rumor in N.S.W. Labor
circles just now is that Premier Holman will
not lead the narty at next general election.
The bulk of the crowd (the non-parliamen-
tary section of it) is sore over his attitude
on the referenda, though it doesn’t seem to
care a straw about the fact that he turned
dog on the party’s alleged decentralisation
policy, and went back on its pledge to reduce
borrowing. These are big, national
matters, so what the devil do they
signify ? Holman is credited with
knowledge when to flee out of the wet. So
the general impression is that he will build
himself an ark of durable materials and float
to the Agent-General’s office in London.
“H.H.” writes: — I
I don’t know all the iniquities the Botha Govern-
ment may be accused of, but I feel kind of sorry
for it. It is up against the Jingo crowd, which
thinks it disgraceful that men with names like Botha
and Smuts should run the show. It isn’t too well
liked by the cosmopolitan mine-owning gang of
capitalists, who promoted the late war so as to bring !
Jo berg under British rule and get cheap Chinese
labor. Now that Jo’berg is under Boer rule, though
the British flag is flying, and the cheap Chinamen
have been chased out of the country, this crowd,
which owns most of the papers, and used to fill them |
with alleged Boer “outrages,” doesn’t absolutely
weep on Botha’s capacious Dutch and Protestant
bosom. Then there are the innumerable niggers and |
the Hindus, who are hostile to any white Govern-
ment ; and the missionary push which wants the j
nigger treated as a brother on religious grounds; j
and the Industrial Workers of the World, who want
him to be a brother because he is a fellow-toiler.
Among all these, Botha must have a hard row to I
hoe, and is probably a soured voortrekker. If one
could imagine Ireland, with the addition of, say,
16.000,000 colored savages—that would make the
proportion about right—who were equally prepared
to cut the throat of Belfast or knock out the brains
of Cork as soon as trouble started, and almost
any ruler would bp prepared to deport almost any-
body rather than let the trouble develop. Then
Botha probably likes the men—mostly English—who
made the late industrial row just as much as Brother
Snowball likes a Roman Catholic. And he has
more reason, for he fought round Ladysmith in
person, while Snowball didn’t carry a rifle at the
Boyne. Probably the Boer Prime Minister didn’t
wait to analyse his feelings or sort out his reasons.
There must have been a joy in calling out, on any
pretence, the old armed forces of Boerdom, and
seeing them again in good working order. Also, in •
depriving the hated British garrison of any excuse
to interfere on behalf of law’n’order, and 'thus ex-
hibiting its beastly superfluousness. Also, in seizing
by the collar and the slack of the pants certain mem-
bers of the race that lowered the old vierkleur—-the
flag of red, white, blue and green—and starting them
off illegally to London, of all places in the world—
London, in which were brewed so many Boer mis-
fortunes. In the recent disturbance, Louis Botha
probably couldn’t disoblige all the people he would
like to have aggravated, but as an aristocratic land-
holder and an old fighting Boer, he tried, I think,
to gratify his own political sentiments, and, at the
same time, to annoy as many of his ancient foes as
he could.
AT THE RACES.
On Wednesday morning Mr. George Reid will be
present at the Sanatorium Race Meeting on the Epsom
Racecourse. The winner of the principal event will be decorated by Mr. Reid with a blue ribbon, presented
by the Mayoress.
We trust that the sporty nag didn't mistake George for a punching ball.
Affairs are looking up in Freetrade Eng-
land, for George V. has fixed the minimum
wage for laborers on his Sandringham estate
at 16s. per week, whereas the regular local
rate is 14s. And yet England isn’t a land
of cheap living. That, country imports stacks
of food from Australia —wheat, flour, butter,
bacon, ham and sundries —because it can
get them as cheaply in Australia as any-
where else. And Bull acquires this food at
Australian rates plus freight. It doesn’t
spell gorgeous luxury for the sixteen-shilling
laborer, but then a bacon-rind goes far among
the Bull poor.
A SUICIDE TOO LONG DEFERRED.
Mr. Cook has definitely announced his intention of
forcing a dissolution at an early date. — News item.
A USTRALIA: "lt's time you put yourself out
of your misery , Joe. You've posted enough
notices about it."
It was proposed at the Labor Conference
sitting in Sydney that the penal clauses of
the Arbitration law should be repealed so
that the person who now unlawfully doesn’t
care a hang for the law should in future be
legally authorised not to care a hang for the
law. It would be cheaper to repen l the
whole business. A statute with no penalty
attached for breakage is so very little of a
statute that it isn’t worth spending money
on it.
Premier Scaddan of Westralia is appar-
ently filled with a joyous resolve to have a
good time and blow the consequence. His
shortage at June, 1912 was over £134,000;
next year it was over £190.000; this year it
is estimated at over £135,000. If Britain
shortaged at the same rate it would have
gone about £70,000,000 to the Devil in three
years. And Scaddan the Madman has got
his borrowings up to £ll per head per an-
num, which bursts the worst records of the
past twice over. Scaddan calls himself a
Laborite, but the term Slave-dealer would
describe him better. For selling posterity
in bondage to the capitalist he holds the
record.
THE PAWNSHOP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Holman rejoices in the cheaper money phase of
the London market. — Telegram from Maoriland, which
the N.S.W. Premier is visiting.
Thank Gawd, the pawnshop’s open,
It’s Monday morning now,
When dawns fresh light and hope in
Each eye and heart and brow !
We starved through dreary Sunday,
While not a bob we raised:
But Uncle starts on Monday,
For which the Lord be praised!
We’ve pawned the bed, the table,
The carpet and the chairs;
If only we were able
We’d pawn the blooming stairs!
The chimney-top will go in
The pop-shop like a flash,
So long as Uncle Cohen
Will find the ready cash.
Untouched by care or worry,
Oh, let us borrow more,
And bravely let us hurry
To reach the pop-shop door;
No cloud the sky discloses,
We see no chance of hurt
While Reuben, Ike and Moses
Will lend upon our shirt.
So Holman, use your brilliance,
And workman, use your brawn,
To borrow yet more millions,
And put yourselves in pawn.
Since borrowing is easy,
Let all your future go
Into the fingers greasy
Of Reub and Ike and Mo.

NEVER FELT BETTER.
“I was nearly mad with pains in my head, and
often had to leave off work,” says Miss R. E. Forster,
55 Iffla Street, South Melbourne, Vic. ‘'J tried every-
thing, but the headaches were just as bad. Then I
read of Chamberlain’s Tablets, and thought I would
try them. The first few doses made a different
woman of me, and a course completely cured me. I
take Chamberlain’s Tablets occasionally, and never
felt better in my life than I do now.”*

NOTIONS
Billy” Bolton, who passed out at North-
cote (Meib.) recently, might have died very rich but
for the bookmakers. As it was, he came down to the
old age pension level. He took up land under Duffy’s
Act in 1869, and prospered exceedingly as a farmer,
stock salesman and butcher. Then he weht in for
horse-breeding, and made a lot of money at that; but
meanwhile he had acquired a passion for the Turf.
Breeding horses had given him a desire for backing
them, and he stuck to the turf long after it had be-
come too corrupt an institution for honest old sports
like “Billy” Bolton. The books got all his money.
And they didn’t even gather in force at his funeral.
It took some of the English billiard ex-
perts a week to discover that George Grey will soon
play his heart-breaking “losers” off the red as easily
with the ivory as with composition balls, and that
his recent match with Newman was merely a trial
gallop for a championship race. If John Roberts of
old could change from ivories to bonzolines' and back
to ivories without losing any of his supremacy over
his rivals, there never should have been any question
as to j'oung Gray being able to adapt the strength of
his bonzoline stroke to a different kind of ball. He
could not have done it to perfection without practice,
but he has now had sufficient practice. He will pro-
bably win the championship with ivory balls, and
then the question of altering the rules of the game
in order to queer the Gray-stroke will be decided
anon by gate-money considerations. If the public
are wearied by the monotony of hundreds of consecu-
tive strokes from baulk, the striker will probably be
restricted, by a new rule, to the centre spot on the
baulk line. But until the Gray-stroke begins to
affect the cash value of professional billiards the
Association will have no reason for further meddling
with the rules.
Football with its casual barracking of
plaj'ers and occasional obliteration of the umpire,
isn’t in it with the quiet game of quoits, the amuse-
ment in which you stand a yard or two off and
throw a few iron rings on a peg. Melbourne, for its
sins, suffers from a Quoits Association, which owns
a “ground” of its own in North Melbourne, and
periodically holds tournaments or jousts. At its
most recent one matters were willing, to put it
mildly. Isaac Shortodds was prevalent and appar-
ently one particularly brawny player, and his
backers were determined to collect the stakes and
wagers somehow. Unfair play led to argument, and
when the discussion was over, one. player had had
his cheek laid open with an iron quoit, another had
lost his sight through a kick on the eye and minor
damages were frequent. The Ass. officials witnessed
all this but took no steps beyond hiring a few
policemen for the rest of the tourney, and of course
the, brawny player won. It is not a difficult matter
to win at quoits if you can kick your opponent’s eye.
Whether Isaac Shortodds was an accomplice or a
victim doesn’t appear.

Sydney on Saturday last was a good place
to be out of. The morning! brought sweltering
heat and a haze of smoke ; the afternoon was broken
up by a southerly storm. It was the commencement
of the ninth round of Sydney First-Grade Cricket,
but the storm swept most of the players from the
various pitches. At Parramatta there was thunder
and lightning, and a sky so gloomy that Central
Cumberland, which was at home to Redfern, sug-
gested making an afternoon of it in the pavilion.
So there was no play there at all. On some other
fields they got in about an hour of battifig when
the sky split and the bottom fell out of the deluge.
Still, at University Oval the ’Varsity got loose on
the Gordon bowling, and slogged it unmercifully, and
when the rain came the Students had piled up 355
for the loss of four wickets. Of this huge total the
gentle Barbour was responsible for 152, and his
club mate Tozer hit up 57. They were the only
batsmen of note that afternoon. Glebe, up against
Paddington, lost eight wickets for 165. North Syd-
ney had hit 36 off the Waverley bowling for the
loss of two wickets when the storm ended things.
Balmain came into possession of 37 for one wicket
off Western Suburbs, and Sydney banged 45 for two
wickets off the bowlers of Middle Harbor. Among
the bowlers the greatest were C. Winning and R. B.
Stafford. The former took three Glebe wickets for
Paddington for 31. and the latter (of the same
team) took three Glebe wickets for 39. The match
between University and Gordon was a very brilliant
affair. The Students hit up their 355 in 155mins.,
and that in a wre.tched light. When the glim was
at its worst 50 were put up in 22min., and when
Farrar left 78 had been compiled in 33min. Farrar’s
own contribution was 36, and included seven fours.
When Tozer joined Barbour they hit up 128 in
47min. Barbour’s huge score of 152 was made in
a trifle less than two hours.
The Rev. Waddy and most of his cric-
keters are now back in Australia, and report
having had a mighty good time in Ceylon. Accord-
ing to the batting parson, the team saw no sign of
resentment on the part of the Cingalese over the
case of the colored doctor who came along as tem-
porary medical officer of the Orontes. The team
spent 25 days in Ceylon, played nine matches and
won eight. The other was against an all-Cingalese
team. Minnett was the top scorer of the tour with
37, and the best bowling was that of Cameron, with
33 wickets for an average of seven.
On Saturday, on wickets that hadn’t been
improved by a wetting the night before, Melbourne
pennant cricketers tackled the tasks set them by
their opponents on the Saturday previous—and mostly
failed badly. ’Wood had gathered in a moderate
208 for its first innings, and East felt cheerful;
but Ryder found a bumpy spot and bowled his dead-
liest, getting nine for 67. East’s total was 132.
P’ran, closing with 308 for two wickets (Healy 136
n.o. and Stephens 149 n. 0.), demolished Northcote
for 118, of which Bevy made 68. On a second go
the bell rang when nine ’Cote wickets were down for
95 narrow squeak. It was P’ran’s first victory
this season. North likewise closed, with nine down
for 295, then ran the Students through for 110, but
couldn’t repeat the performance in the time. Fitz-
roy had scored 197 at its first try, and
should have dogwalloped Carlton; but its bowlers
failed to leap to the opportunity, so the old Blue-
and-Whites put up 267 for five wickets, and gathered
in the two points. Veteran Warne made 67 n.o
and inter-Stater Sewart 100. Richmond and
Essendon galloped through the better part of four
innings in a violent hurry, the former making 138
and 130 for nine wickets and the latter 190 and a
lamentable 30, whereby Richmond gained three points.
Melbourne collected 330 in the first innings of its
practice match with St. Hilda, and then polished off
the latter for 113, ex-Queenslander Ironmonger tak-
ing nine for 30, which was a feat. Another feat
was the stumping of four Saints by Henty ; but he
discounted this largely by allowing 26 extras. Still,
he did his share.
Hereby affirmed that little Macartney, the
Gordon cherub, is the greatest batsman of this Aus-
tralasian cricket season. In inter-State matches
Macartney has piled a century against every State
(barring Westralia) and Maoriland. Which is a thing
no other batsman has ever done so far. Just con-
sider how he has banged :

The fighting spirit of Old Ireland arises in
the Irish-American battle at the Sydney
Slonchium. Eddie McGoorly wins on points
over Pat Bradley.
The cricket match between Tasmania and
N. S. Wales at Sydney Cricket Ground, which started
on Iriday last, was not an exciting episode. The
lassies were dismissed for 163, the top score being
Eltham’s 46. His best assistants were Robinson
with 33 and Myers with 31. On Saturday the Ma
State team got going, and lifted 403 on to the
board for the loss of five wickets. It was plain
assault and battery. Of this huge score, Macartney
smote 101 and carried his bat. Cranney made 75,
Taylor 83, Ratcliife 51, and Andrews (n. 0.) 43. On
Monday N.S.W. continued. Macartney lifted his
little score to 110, and the side piled up 451. Tas-
mania. faced with a deficit of 288 on the first
innings, just crumpled up, and was disposed of for
108, N.S.W. thus winning by an innings and 180
runs. There is no joy in this sort of thing, and it
is mere waste of good voice to crow.

The Australian XI at Auckland (M.L.)
dismissed Auckland for 251, the only show of stub-
born resistance being put up by Hemus, who perpe-
trated 112 off the N.S.W. bowling before he was
bagged by Noble off McKenzie. Sundries, 21, also
gave some trouble. Australia then went to the
sticks, and hit up 35 by nightfall without losing anv
timber. On Saturday the battue continued, Waddy
(130), Armstrong (128), Ransford (159) and the
rest lifted the score to 655 for eight wickets. On
Monday the Australian innings came to a sudden and
startling close, the last two wickets falling in nine
minutes, and leaving the total score 658. With 407
m arrears, Auckland lost heart or abandoned its
stomach or something. It gave up the ghost in the
second innings for 186, and so lost by an innings
and 221 runs. There is no joy about this.
The first leg for the Northcote Cup was
an easy win for the Sydney yacht Rawhiti 11. But
the second bout was one to be remembered. Victoria
was represented by the Killara and the Rip. When
they drifted down to the line there was hardly a
breath of air, but overhead clouds were gathering
fast and forked lightning was sprinting over the
billowing masses, while grumbling thunder gave
warning of what was to come. A sudden puff danced
on cloven hoofs across the water. The Rawhiti 11.
shook out a balloon jib and caught it, and went
after the Killara, which had drifted over the line.
Then there came a warm, hot wind from the west,
and away went the Killara like a fleeing insolvent.
The Rip went after with a bound, and the Rawhiti
was left in the rear. At the first flag, off Quaran-
tine, the Killara was 12sec. ahead of the Rip, and a
minute ahead of the Rawhiti, and was walking
through the water beautifully. Then Rawhiti began
to increase the pace, and in a little while Rip was
third, and Rawhiti was racing after the fleeing
Killara. Hereabouts the western wind failed utterly,
and a dead calm fell down on the harbor and left
the sails flapping lazily. But the corpse lasted for
a very brief space. Out of the stillness came a tear-
ing southerly. All in a moment the premises were
foaming and boiling like a pot. Killara went away
with the first blast, and rode, on the wings of the
wind, as the poet says in his sober moments. The
Rip also flew faster and passed Rawhiti. But they
had more sail than they could carry, and it was a
case of shorten or go under. Rawhiti had done
her reefing in the shelter, but had lost 14min. doing
froth, and Killara, with shortened sail, was slogging
through it, gaining all the time. Rip, over-canvassed,
' vas . hopelessly out of it, and Rawhiti was far
behind. The race was as good as won—when, with
a report like a gun the mainsail split, and Killara
was a deposed monarch. The only question was
whether Rawhiti could overhaul the rolling Rip.
It did, and finished with 25sec. to spare. But, all
the same, it was luck, and not navigation, that gave
Rawhiti the second leg-in, and so kept the Northcote
Cup in Sydney.

The Sydney Sailing Club had an awful
time in the squall that swept Port Jackson on Satur-
day. When the boats got under way the north-
east breeze was light as thistle down. It was more
quiet and peaceful than the tread of a cat’s feet, or
the stepping of an unsupported rumor. But shortly
after 4 p.m. it chopped round, and hot, vicious
blasts came driving out of the west and toppled over
the Mona at the new Pile Light. It blew the sails
right off the Eagle. It picked up and dashed down
the Acme, 11. C. < Press and Quibree, and a round
dozen only avoided capsize by lowering away every-
thing all at once. Only seven of the 23 starters
managed to battle through it. The police boat and
the pilot steamer came to the rescue of the swamped
and capsized squadron, and while they fished the
crews out of the water the Pastime flew on to victory
in spite of its huge sails, followed by the Golding,
Eunice and Kismet. It was a great afternoon for
ducks, bunyips, whales, teal, mermaids and other
marine fowl.
Dear B., —There was something of a hustle
last week in Sydney haunts where they wager and in-
dulge in illicit acts. The reason was (1) it was
announced that the installation of the Tote was
almost a certainty during the coming session; (2)
the press gave it out that betting dens were going to
be raided much the same as opium and other joints.
Everybody was preparing to get out. But in the
end nobody got out, no raids were made and nothing
happened. Ichabod Shortodds came out bold as brass
on Saturday when Athenic, which had been a hot
favorite for the Newmarket Handicap, went to
pieces, joined the halt and lame, and blew to smith-
ereens the hopes of those who had got in early.
Ichabod had the laugh, for he knew so well that, an
hour before the announcement of the breakdown,
he was laying 10 times the odds he had laid 24
hours previously.—Yours etc., Blow the Odds.

The disappearance of Daddy Levien from
N.S.W. Legislative Assembly is a matter of much
concern to certain people who frequent the race-
courses of the Ma State. Daddy’s annual Bill to
legalise the Tote on N.S.W. racecourses always got
lost, tripped up, bogged, or killed by accident; and
while Daddy was on the job early each session with
a foredoomed Bill no one else could get a say. Now,
anything is possible, and it is known that about half
the present Cabinet is virulently in favor of the
introduction of the Tote and the other half is mildly
opposed to it. The position is full of danger. Also,
there is a suspicion that the use of the Tote is NOT
illegal under the present Act. After all these years,
when things were taken for granted, some new law
authority has got his eye on the matter, just as the
belated theologian got on to the story of the Creation
in Genesis, and the new man thinks the old opinion '
is aged bosh. The whole question is whether in-
vesting money in the Tote can be considered “wager-
ing.” If it is a form of wagering or betting, then
there is nothing to prevent any club installing the
Tote right away. And there is more than one club
anxious to make the experiment. So Ichabod Short-
odds is perturbed. To end the suspense he pro-
poses to get a Bill introduced to define “betting” as
the making of a wager with a person “registered
to lay the odds.” It should take a fair amount of
bribery and corruption to get that through.
This coming Saturday will see the Yankee
athletic team in all its warpaint at Sydney Sports
Ground ; and it will be the best lot that has crossed
the path of the N.S.W. Athletic Association for many
a long day. The team is well worth seeing, and it
is up to the Sydney public to blow along and waste
some shekels at the gate.
N.S.W. amateur champion cyclist Stanley
Burtenshaw, who goes to Bananaland to uphold the
tail of the Ma State in the Australasian Champion-
ships, takes on the office without having to submit
to the formality of a “test.” He is so easily above
the balance of the pedallers that the N.S.W. Cyclists’
Union passed him the honor with both hands. C.
M. Cutliffe will be the second string in the Ma
fiddle in case of the champion blowing up or other-
wise going wrong.
The bottom fell out of the Australian
Sculling Championship match last week when chal-
lenger Prank Hagney failed to materialise with the
final £4O deposit. So Charlie Towns retains the
title and the gauds appertaining thereunto. But
how has the glory departed when an Australian cham-
pionship falls through for the lack of a miserable
40 sovereigns!
Miss Edith Carr, a well-known Bathurst
(N.S.W.) lady rifle-shot, beat all her previous bests
last Saturday, when at 800yds. in 15 shots she
threw 12 bullets into the cow’s eye and scored three
“inners.” Officially the score was 72 out of a
possible 75. The nearest were two male competitors,
P. Neale and E. Tennant, who each scored 70. The
conditions were unfavorable. During the whole of
the shoot a strong wind was blowing in fitful gusts
right across the range.
Milburn Saylor, the long-armed freak
Yankee fighter with the enormous punch, came to
grief at Brisbane last Saturday night, when he fell
into the arms of Eddie Newhouse, of Victoria. Find-
ing the Victorian an awkward customer, Saylor held
him with the left and drove his right at the Aus-
tralian’s jaw. As he had already been cautioned
several times, the indignant referee took a hand, and
immediately awarded the laurels to Newhouse. It is
understood that this little episode makes Saylor
lose a certain bet involving anew suit of clothes.
The result was a surprise. Another mild sensation
was the defeat of McCoy in Melbourne by Nat Wil-
liams. Each weighed 9st. 91b., and the house was
enthusiastic towards McCoy. But Williams proved a
skilful and elusive foe, who baffled the rapid Vic-
torian with still greater rapidity. Right up to the
18th round McCoy was a bewildered bruiser who
could not understand where his enemy had escaped
to or how he did it. But in the 18th McCoy got
home a right cross, and Williams wandered round
and pervaded the place generally, being all but out.
After that he was on the defensive and was more
elusive than ever, but as the referee reckoned he
had the majority of the points for the fight he gave
him the verdict. The decision was received with
howls of protest.
* * * 41-
Little Waldemar Holberg, the Danish
boxer, left Australia by the Sonoma on Saturday last
for Yankeeland. He was one of the pluckiest fight-
ers that ever came to this country, but bad
luck dogged him persistently during the whole of
his stay in Australia. Asa warrior he is very much
handicapped by the brevity of his reach, and many
of the men he had to meet carried their top-pieces
quite out of the Dane’s field of action. But Waldemar
cannonaded their bodies when he couldn’t reach their
heads, and his plucky fight against Hughie Mehegan
will be remembered for years. On that occasion he
fought himself to a standstill.
Expectation ran high when Eddie
McGoorty and Pat Bradley entered the ring at Syd-
ney Stadium last Saturday night. The betting was
-.10 to one “on,” and dozens of gentlemen who seemed
to think they were gifted with prophetic powers
laid two to one against Pat Bradley lasting five
rounds. Some reckless wights laid odds, he wouldn’t
last one. McGoorty did not advance to the attack
with the same contemptuous self-assurance with
which he swept down on Smith. He approached as
he would approach any boxer unto whom he had
respect. McGoorty looked about half a stone
heavier, although at the afternoon weighing there
was only about 2oz. difference. Certainly, he was the
taller, and blessed with the longer reach. And he
had the skill to make use of it. There was no sign
of trepidation about Patrick. He didn’t hang back
in the breeching; stilt ,jless did he flee in terror
from the scene at the sight of his adversary. He
came out as he always comes, and began captiously,
as is his wont. MpGoorty got a specimen Pat’s
goods in the first round when, stepping in to deliver
a left hook, the top side of his cheek received a
swing which, had it landed a couple of inches lower,
would have meant mischief. It soon became obvious
that McGoorty had noted the fact that Pat’s, wallops
were loaded, and h,e was not there to take risks.
The audience cheertd madly when Pat went to his
corner at the end of the first round uninjured.
And when he survived theg'second round and seemed
to some to have more than held his own, the whole
lunatic asylum broke lO'tfse. But McGoorty was
playing the right game. He was there to defend his
championship. It was not a fight to be fought with
a sudden rush. This fellow was -made of sterner
stuff than Smith, and all the he was liable
to sting with either hand. St)^ 1 McGoorty settled
down to outpoint Bradley, and did it. Slowly but
surely Patrick was worn down. But he always
came back with the ghost of a smile on his lips.
He was up against a man who could hit just a shade
faster, and the death-laden smite that Pat was going
to let flv so often was anticipated. And with
anticipation the aim went wild. At the end it
resolved itself into a determined struggle on the part
of Bradlev to keep on his feet for 20 rounds, and,
knowing that he could still sting and that the battle
was actually won, McGoorty did not risk being
knocked out by going in to get what he did not
really require. Which was sound wisdom on the
part of McGoorty.
The general note of comment on the fight is one
of disappointment at McGoorty’s showing, and
that thoughtful fighter is now suffering for the ease
with which he.knocked out Smith. That has been
accepted as his staiidard,' and every time he fails
to live up to it he will receive hostile comment from
the crowd, if not from the press. It is very absurd,
but it is a fact. As far as this winter is concerned,
McGoorty deserves more praise for beating Bradley
on points in 20 rounds than he did for blotting out
the radiance of Smith in half, a round. That, night,
anyhow, Smith could not fight. It was not a battle,
but a battue. On the other hand, Bradley could
fight, and fought like the Devil ; but plucky, tough,
and hard hitting as Bradley was to the finish,
McGoorty beat him decisively, and surely it is better
to decisively beat on points a man who covers
himself with glory than to wreck one who had
temporarily left his glory at home along with the
cat and his old clothes. There is now a possibility
of McGoorty being matched with Jerry Jerome, and
Duke Mullins, that master-maker of fighters, has
undertaken to get Jerry fit. DT-ke Mullins has a
stout heart, but this writer is willing to wager it is
utterly broken before he can get the colored brother
into the white man’s ideal state of fitness for a
battle. Anyhow, if the battle does take place it will
be mighty interesting, and most of all to Eddie
McGoorty.
* * * *
Next Saturday night Johnny Summers will
have his return battle with Tom McCormick at Syd-
ney Stadium. He will make a determined effort to
recover his lost championship, and add to it that
of the world. Summers did not fight up to form at
the last encounter, and by the look of things he
will be in better condition for Saturday night’s effort
than for any other struggle he has fought in Aus-
tralia

"O.K.” : A large majority of officahs com-
plain that the prohibition of the sale of in-
toxicants by the canteens at the military
training camps has tended to demoralise the
public service in the interests of Private
Enterprise. There is more drunkenness
among the men than of old, because they
get from outside quite as much liquor as they
formerly bought in camp, and the quality is
not so good. The canteen profits, which were
devoted to regimental purposes, are now
diverted to the pockets of licensed publicans
and skinners. What was intended for a
compulsory temperance movement is merely
benefiting the intemperance cause at the ex-
pense of military discipline. Even the tee-
total officahs, who hate the very name of
derrink, would rather have it sold in the
canteens than brought to camp by the men
under their belts or smuggled in for future
consumption. Tbe liquor traffic at the can-
teens could be kept under reasonable con-
trol, whereas the sale of poison to soldiers
at the pubs' is beyond control, and the same
men who would have gone comparatively
sober to bed after a booze on the spot are
now likely to come rolling home in a state
of insubordination. Of the two evils the
carrying of drink into camp on the quiet is
preferable to the rowdy way of bringing it
along, therefore a majah who would punish
any other breach of the regulations finds
himself winking at the grog smuggle. Better
for the men to carouse in moderation on the
premises than to be fined as drunk-and-dis-
orderlies by magistrates outside. Finally,
the non-Wowser officahs consider themselves
aggrieved in being doomed to suffer a dry
canteen. They also are as malcontents in a
temperance township where the contents are
a ridiculously small minoritv.

It is not often that an athlete comes back
so decisively as Maoriland's champion pro. ped.,
W. F. Trembath, did at the M.L. Cash Champion-
ships. This great half-miler retired two years ago,
but recently began to look towards the track again.
The experts reckoned he couldn’t come back, but at
Auckland he dead-heated in the 220yds. with T. J.
O’Callaglian in 22 2-ssec., won the 440yds. as he
liked in 53 3-ssec. ; and cantered home in the half-
mile, 20yds. ahead of the field, in lmin. 59 l-ssec.
On the last day of the meeting the officials thought
they’d like to see the champion really extended
over his favorite distance, so they put him on scratch
in a special half-mile handicap, and sprinkled the
track in front of him, out towards the limit mark,
with all the alleged champions they could rake up.
When the gun went, Trembath didn’t appear to have
a dog's chance of making up those handicaps; but,
running beautifully, he raced through the field in
great style, and broke the worsted with something
to spare, in lmin. 55 4-ssec. This is the fastest
competition half-mile ever run in Maoriland by
either an amateur or a pro.
“Moana”: Athletically Auckland (M.L.)
is pawing the air just now because, in an Invitation
Scratch Race, its pet amateur, A. W. Dormer, beat
Power, of Dollarland, by five yards over a mile in
4min. 24 3-ssee. In spite of all the enthusiasm,
however, I do not think that Dormer, great runner
though he undoubtedly is, can honestly be consid-
ered a match for Power, fit and well. The Auck-
land ped. was wound right up for this event. He
certainly ran the race of his life ; but he finished all
out. The Yankee boy never struck form in the
Borrowing Isles. He was dead stale all the time,
and had great difficulty in running the mile under
4min. 40sec. It was only the extra training, the
dry weather, the hard track and about a ton of
grit that put him as close to Dormer’s heels as he
got. You have only to see Power run, however, to
realise what a genius he is in that particular line.
Last year he ran all the season in the States, and
never took longer than 4min. 22sec. to cover a mile.
Several times the watches showed better than 4min.
20sec., and on one occasion the time was 4min.
17 l-ssec.

brother, Guy, made some good scores in inter-State
cricket for Queensland some seasons ago. “Len’s”
fault as a forward in Australia was a touch of slow-
ness. As he is now reckoned the best forward in
England, he must have hurried up.
An old critic’s verdict: Cricket form in
Australia is not really as inconsistent as it looks,
although N.S.W., which takes the Shield, has lost to
S.A., while Vic., which can’t even extend N.S.W.,
has won the only match in which it was up against
S.A. Ma really is too good for the rest, who are
about equal to each other. The surprise packet
is South Aus., which on its day may do anything.
Last year it slaughtered, on its own Oval, N.S.W.
by an innings (Massie not coming off on his first
visit to the ground that has damaged so many bowl-
ing reputations) ; then two fairly close wins over
Vic. sent the Shield to hang in Adelaide’s Art Gal-
lery for a year. This season S.A. won in Sydney,
by a bare 19 runs. Crawford did that, and it is
in Crawford that the inconsistency is to be found.
On his day he is a World’s XI man; but his day
comes only sometimes. All the States have fine bats-
men, but it is bowling that wins matches. Given
Crawford and Whitty in form, S.A. may beat Bards-
ley, Trumper, Macartney and co. any time; but last
month, with Whitty away with a leg, and Crawford
“off” with a thumb, S.A. descended to a fairly even
draw with the Maorilanders. To express the incon-
sitency in figures, it seems barely 2 to 1 on N.S.W.
against S.A., quite 6 to 1 on Ma against Vic., and a
level-money chance between the other two.
Ex-Sydney mermaid Annette Ivellerman
and her swimming partner, Robert Brennan, lately
met an unusual sort of accident at Hamilton, in
Bermuda. They were doing Annette’s nymph act in
a glass tank filled with SOOOgals. of water. The
blessed tank burst, and a cataract of water swept
Annette and her companion over the jagged edge of
the broken glass, which cut them so badly that they
had to be hurried to the hospital.

Canterbury, the boss cricketing province
of Maoriland and holder of the Plunket Shield, has
been having a strenuous time lately. Seven of its
best men were in the team that was taking violent
leather-hunting exercise in Australia recently, so
rival provinces considered the time was ripe to get
away with the bauble. Otago and Wellington hurled
in challenges that demanded immediate decision, so
the Canterbury selectors picked a gang of promising
boys and engaged in prayer. The Scotchmen from
Otago came along first, and did up 187. Canter-
bury replied with 189 (Caygill 47), and things were
interesting. But the boy defenders fell upon Otago
in the second innings, and sent the team back to
the pavilion for a paltry 71 ; Monaghan (four for 19)
and Wilson (three for nine) doing the damage.
Canterbury knocked up the required runs for four
wickets, and felt like cabling the tourists in Aus-
tralia that they could stay away for good. Having
cut its teeth on Otago, it invited Wellington to come
along, and, winning the toss, went to the sticks
and notched 367. Wellington could only scratch
169, but saved a follow-on. Canterbury’s second
venture added 253, and Wellington faced the hopeless
task of making 453 or going home without the
Shield. The best it could do was 208, so the Shield
is still where Reese and his merry men left it. Can-
terbury’s nose is now very much in the air, and it is
asking the other provinces if there’s any other game
they can play.

At Auckland (M.L.) recently the crack
Australian pacer, Denver Huon, was sent over two
miles in hurried pursuit of the M.L. harness record.
Without apparent effort, he beat the previous best,
and put 4min. 28 l-ssec. on the slate as his con-
tribution. The Trotting Club, at whose meeting the
record smashing was featured, showed its joy by
presenting the fast moke’s owner with 100 sovs.

Announced that the Sydney Olympia
Stadium (Newtown) has secured Tahmmy Burns,
Pelkev. Holland and another, described as a “suit-
able lightweight.” Presumably Tahmmy comes as
manager only, and without any ideas of re-entering
the ring. Where the profit is going to come in is
hard to see. The Olympia is a small place com-
pared to the Rushcutter’s Bay Stadium, and it has
no “circuit.” Considering the sort of maw the average
American boxer has, the managers of the Olympia,
which will hold only about 5000 or 6000 people,
will not stand to make much out of the foreign
stars.
* * * *
R. Spears, the Dubbo (N.S.W.) cyclist,
who some time ago went abroad to seek fame and
fortune, seems to be on the right track. Before
leaving the U.S.A. lie several times overthrew the
Vankee Sneed King, Frank Kramer, who has bossed
the ’Merican tracks for the last 12 years. The
cognoscenti tip that on the first opportunity Spears
will be high un in the race for the world’s cham-
pionship. He has already demonstrated that he is
as fast as the world’s best—and he is a rising star.

“Moana”: The par. (B. 22/l/’l4) giving
aviation statistics, dug out by Roger de Paginat, is
decidedly interesting when a little arithmetic is ap-
plied with a view to discovering how many miles have
been flown for every death recorded, in 1908 the
distance per corpse was only 1000 miles; in 1909 it
was 9200 miles; in 1910, 20,700 miles; in 1911,
30,000 miles; in 1912 it had soared to 85,700 miles.
So flying grows safer. The number of miles per
burial is as good a test as you can get.

“Jack”: (P. J.) Bourke, of the Golden Mile (W.A.),
has just gone aloft to offer the angels fresh verses
to set to music. He died at Ivalgoorlie, of pneu-
monia. As “Bluebush” his lines have fallen in many
papers, and as “Red Shirt” his caustic prose made a
dab of bright color in the Ivalgoorlie Sun. He was
a Peel River (N.S.W.) boy when he was younger.
“T. 0.1.” : The new Council Chambers of Waverley
(N.S.W.) have been enriched by the portrait Of an
.old-tipie pressman who was the father of municipal
institutions in N. S. Wales —Charles St. Julian, one
of the original members of the Waverley Council
and third Mayor of the borough. Subsequently he
became Mayor of "Marrickvillc, and in the year of his
m.a.Voralt.v, there (1806-7) he compiled and published
“The Municipalities Act of 1867, with Notes, etc.,
and a Draft Code of. Bylaws.” Mr. St. Julian was
born in France in 1819, and 18 years later emigrated
to Adelaide (S.A.), where he wrote for the Aus-
tralian Chronicle and subsequently for the Com-
. micrci'al Journal. In 1843 he joined the staff of
the S. M. Herald, which he left four years later
for the Sydney Chronicle, afterwards known as the
Free Press. In 1849 he rejoined the Herald, and
remained as law reporter until 1872, when he re-
ceived the appointment of Chief Justice of Fiji from
Kjng Thakambau. He had for some time nreviously
been Consul at Sydney for Fiji. He died at Levuka,
• November 26, 1874, just after the islands were
ceded to Britain. The portrait presented to the
Waverley Council is the work of a grand-daughter
of “Sir Charles” (Thakambau knighted him), and
is, the gift of the St. Julian family. St. Julian’s
father-in-law, E. J. Hawkesley, was also distinguished
as a pressman. lie founded the radical paoer, the
People’s Advocate, and was the fearless critic who,
for having denounced a son of Sir Charles Fitzroy
as a card-cheat, suffered fine and imprisonment. Mr.
Hawkeslev’s 1 later years were spent in the Govern-
ment Printing Office; but in the first ’7o’s he took
compensation, and followed his son-in-law to Fiji.
From 1849 to date, a period of 65 years, the S. M.
Herald has had only three law reporters —Charles
St. Julian, who became Chief Justice of. Fiji ; Pem-
broke Latharn .Murray,. who became ’ an. officer of the
Australian ’ Artillery; and Horace Rogers, who has
grown white and shrunk in the service.

“Billy B.”: There are still a few papers where a
man can-spread himself occasionally, but you’ve got
to go far out for them. I dropped on one the
other day published in North Queensland. It con-
tained a report of a. dance at Proserpine, and this is
how my inky brother saw that everybody got a square
deal. “At 10.30 refreshments were handed round,
and the following ladies were to the fore in seeing
that one and all had all they required (here follow
a dozen names). After refreshments dancing was
, resumed _ until 12 o’clock. Mr.-—■ — supplied. the
music in his well-known and highly appreciated
mariner, and Mr. —, a new .arrival, proved himself
the best M.C. it has been our lot to see-in the dis-
trict. Mr. : —— attended to'the boiling of the water
for tea and coffee, and like everything else in connec-
tion \\'ith the -evening . there was nothing halfhearted
about it. Songs were sung by the Bros., which
need no comment, and a stranger, Mr. ——■, also
obliged with a song. At the close Mr. , chair-
man of committee, in a few well-chosen words,
thanked everyone for their attendance and intimated
that it was intended toehold entertainments once l a
month.” Has anybody seen in the city daily papers
for years anything so delightfully refreshing as the
homelv remarks concerning the gent, who boiled the
water ?
Tom Johnson’s successor (pro tem., if not for
good) on the N.S.W. railways tried journalism for a
while after leaving King’s School and Newington
College: his beat on the Inky Way was up at Mudgee.
But the life didn’t grip John Harper, so he passed
into the clerical branch of the Railways.

“Looniac”: Apropos Desmond, the poet of the
first little Labor paper that “Billy” Hughes had any-
thing to do with, and to which Holman .was also a
contributor. Desmond and I lived together in Wel-
lington (M.L.). He was the most uncompromising
rebel against “Lawnorder” I ever met,'; and for that
reason was often an embarrassing companion. Walk-
ing down Lambton Quay, night or day, he would
remark suddenly: “I am going to address this
crowd. You assist me.” And straightway he would
damn capital and privilege more emphatically than
any Domain orator, until he was “moved on.” He
would stand in front of some commercial magnate’s
residence, and recount the man’s social imperfections
to a delighted audience. Wellington, was .dis-
cussing the swiftest and simolest method {of ' exe-
cuting him when he migrated to Sydney and!, puriued
his mission there. At the tithe of the rbank crash
he got into trouble for pasting up on Jjhi door of a
financial institution which had so far stood the
strain: “(lone Bung.” As it was a savings bank,
which held the hard-won trifle of the poor, many
people thought it was the wrong place to
start a panic. Another favorite exploit of
this irrepressible rebel was to dress up in rags and
tatters and ostentatiously walk up the aisle of a
fashionable church to the front news, as a protest
against the “Christianity” of the richly-bedecked
congregation. Hughes’s statement that Desmond
“exuded noetrv” hardly expresses it. lie lived
poetry and delivered it ertampo'-c in his harangues.
One piece of his at the time attained a world-wide
fame, travelling through the Old World and America
—“Barr, of the Western Chain.” 1 wonder where
Desmond is now. And .if he is dead,. I ponder who
killed him !

founder and for many years editor of the Black
Cat. It was what is known in Amvrka as a fad-
zine, its fad being fiction. Umbstaetter’s idea was
' that there. Was a live demand for a small monthly
that would publish five or six good short stories,
without the usually unnecessary illustrations, and sell
for five cents. So the Black Cat was born, and was
a success from the first meow.

“Riggles”: This is the way they run newspapers
in well, it’s in Maoriland. For years past two
strong morning papers have foisted petty four-page
' reprints upon the public as “evening papers.” The
threatened irruption of a competitor scared these
moribund productions into new life and forced them
to secure new talent.' To one of them came a man
full of push and energy, and with his spare brains
streaming behind him. Answering the ’phone one
day, he found that the private sec. of the Minister of
Public Health had an important statement to hand
out about the removal of quarantine restrictions
between the Commonwealth and M.L. “Very sorry,”
replied Energy; “we have no reporters in at the
moment.” “Oh,” said the sec., “but what can you do
about it?” “The only thing I can suggest,”
answered Energy, “is that you ring up the other
paper, give it to them, and ask them to give us a
proof.” Greatly marvelling, the sec. did it. “Right
O,” responded the other paper. “I’ll be over.” He
was> got the item, wandered back to his own office,
and then delivered the proof personally to the
“rival.” “Ah, thanks,” blandly said Energy.
“Thought you people’d be sure to have somebody,
so I asked the Circumlocution Office to ring you up.”

Best Motor Car Value ever offered in Australia
from StudebaKer's point of view!
Taking it all round, can you name any car that gives such standard
value for the money? There’s a reason. We could easily sell for a
higher price, but would sooner sell three cars than two. The smaller
margin of profit means a big sales-slieet. Our policy is to provide the
best ONE-PRICE car possible, to ensure large sales and Satisfied
Owners —and we’ve done it.
We do not claim this to be the “BEST CAR IN THE WORLD,
nor do we make any claim or any assertion that we are not prepared to
stand by and PROVE. What we do maintain is that, for value, oui car
has no equal anywhere, certainly not in Australia —and that is. endorsed
on all sides by those who have fully investigated the proposition.
So Studehaker is satisfied.
from the Dealer’s point of view!
All centres have long been taken up by dealers of standing, and years
of experience, who have fully realised the possibilities. That is a strong
point in itself. They realised that, as a selling proposition, we had
to meet the public demand —they advised us what the public demand
was, and how to set about the thing in the best way —and we did it.
In this way both Studebaker and the Dealers are satisfied.
from the Public point of view!
Our whole case stood or fell by the “PUBLIC VERDICT.”
Some months ago we started to advertise. The response was mag-
netic. Inquiries poured in, sales went up by leaps and hounds. Liberal
shipments of cars were sold on arrival. Dealers wired us for supplies
on all sides, and sales are increasing every day.
We presented them with a “one-price Car.” There is but ONE
Price. No more—no less.
In Equipment, Design and Satisfactory Service we presented to the
public more than they had ever been offered before —constituting them the
JUDGE AND JURY. We set out to win the PUBLIC CONFIDENCE
—and we’ve done it.
So Stndebaker, the Dealers, and the PUBLIC are all satisfied.

BANANA LAND
One Uyematsu, agent of the shipping
circle of Nagasaki, discoursed thus to the
Brisbane press last week: —
Japan is over-populated ; Australia is under-pop.u-
lated; yet you do not want u5....1n our shipbuild-
ing yards we do everything. The European officials
once employed have been gradually replaced by Japs.
.... Good-night!
Well, what has the Jap to complain about?
He doesn’t want Europeans in Nippon, and
the Australian doesn’t want Japs in Aus-
tralia ; and each takes steps to carry his
wishes into effect.
“Caber” : Of the 43 members who sat in
the Queensland Assembly in 1877, whep(
George Fox, just dead, was first elected,'
only four remain—Sam Griffith. Peter
McLean, the evergreen Charlie Buzacott,
and the very ancient Peter Fitzalan McDon-
ald.
“Johnny” Woolcock, Queensland Parlia-
mentary draughtsman, is a good specimen of
the self-manufactured Australian. He first
came into prominence at an early age, by
delivering milk to the nobility and gentry of
Kelvin Grove, a Brisbane suburb, where his
family ran a dairy. Subsequently a Gram-
mar School scholarship set him on the road
which led through the University to the
Queensland Bar, of which he is now one of
the leaders. Some years ago he collaborated
with one Pain in a consolidation of the
Queensland statutes, and he lias published
other light literature of a similar class.
“P.F." : Some weeks ago Tiie Bulletin,
talking about clerical alderman, said that
the public-spirited Father Minnagh, of Bun-
daberg, could be the next mayor of that town
it he. liked. A few days ago, at the municipal
elections, his Reverence topped the poll.
Here’s a health to you, Father O’Flynn!”
Surgeon Thomas Fitzgerald, of Melbourne,
delivered scores of true verdicts in his time,
and another of them after manv years has
now come true. When Dr. Murray, R.C.
Bishop of Cooktown, was at Echuca (Vic.)
18 years ago, he damaged his knee in a fall
from a horse. “Fitz” fixed him up
and the patient looked and felt as
well as ever. “But,” said Fitz, “if
you. live till you turn 60, that knee
is likely to go again for want of native oil.”
Dr. Murray is now 68 and he goes about on
crutches. He has applied for and is expect-
ing to receive a coadjutor at an early date.
QUID PRO QUO
SINGER: “ Have you the 'Owl’ in C? ”
NEW HAND: “The ‘Owlin Sea' sir? No sir; but we ’ave ‘Asleep in the. Deep ’ if that
would do, sir."
Another mystery in municipal valuations
has been dug up in Brisbane. Ten years ago
the city was valued at £5,538,000. To-day,
in spite of borrowing and booming, the rate-
payers are asked to pay taxes on only
£5,232,000, or £300,000 less.
“G. Up”: Excepting me, Queensland’s
learned Governor is the poorest public
speaker that ever mumbled the language. I
lately squeezed into a Downs agricultural
gathering to hear his Ex. discourse on the
exhibits. “What’s he like?” I asked of a
heavily-bearded farmer whose broad back
blocked further progress. “Like!” he
growled, turning round. “Like! Like a
horse chewin’ pumpkin !”
“Boro Belle”: Mackay, which was to have
been ruined through the withdrawal of
Tanna from the sugar industry (vide Tory
press forecasts seven years ago), is witness-
ing a boom in motor-cars, no less than 30
new ones having made thejr appearance on
the streets during the past 12 months, while
fully 40 now honk through the district.
Even a number of poor, down-trodden
cockies own cars, while half a dozen others
have invested in motor-tractor engines to
do their own and neighbors’ ploughing,
water-raising, chaffcutting and wood-saw-
ing. This they find a Profitable sideline.
Another sign of ruin is seen on the sand-
fringed edge of the town, where a big harbor
scheme, embracing the construction of a
three-mile ferro-concrete viaduct to carry a
railway, across to Flat Top anchorage, is in
full swing. Over 100 men are already on
the job. The works will take five years to
complete, and will cost a quarter of a mil-
lion. So the results of the expensive white
labor fad are surely coming home to roost.
As headmaster of Brisbane Grammar
School, “Regy” Roe, now Queensland's
Inspector-General of Education, acquired a
nickname through his anatomical peculiari-
ties. That, however, never prevented Past
and Present swearing by him. Though of a
most unmilitary figure, he always led his
School cadets' to camp. As a soldier he
achieved fame by telling the late Colonel
“Tom” Price what he thought of him—a
thing very few people did, though many felt
like it. It was at Lytton camp, and, after
some rqanceuvres, the officers were gathered
about “Tom,” who was then commandant.
After “Tom” had given his opinion of things
in the style which made him famous, he
asked if anyone had any blankety sugges-
tion to make. Then it was that “Regy” had
a suggestion. He suggested that his
superior’s language was horrible.
Bananaland has been taking itself very
seriously in educational matters lately. In
the last four years it has established a Uni-
versity, half a dozen high schools, and a
teachers’ training college; it has raised the
school age from 12 to 14, introduced medical
and dental inspection of schools, and formed
a staff of itinerant teachers. Half a dozen
years ago it was . down in the trough; now
it holds itself up for comparison with the
rest of Australia. Its bills have advanced
in proportion to its progress, and this year’s
grant per head of population is the heaviest
in the Commonwealth. But it has the satis-
faction of claiming the smallest proportion
of un-scliooled children in the Commonwealth
in spite of the vast distances between some
of it's humpies.
Jenkinson, the new mayor of Brisbane, is
master-printer. For years he represented
Fassifern in the Legislative Assembly, but
was outed by that Wienholt who later tried
to bump Andrew Fisher in Wide Bay and
took the count himself. He has attacked
the fossildom of the Brisbane Council dur-
ing his period as alderman, but the stirring
of those dreadfully dry bones will call for a
louder trump than “Jenky’s.” His brother
ill the South Brisbane rabbit-feathers is
“Joe” Allen, fruit auctioneer, whose chief
claim to distinction is that he is the Wow-
sensh chairman of the Board of Cricket
Control, cricket worship being “Joe’s” great
redeeming vice.
Derelict.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The old ship rots and reeks of perished tar,
And rust, and many strange and stagnant
things ;
She hears the free seas falling on the bar
• And sees the answer of a yacht’s white
wings
But derelict, she shall not pass again
To those green wonders of the purple main.
Yet sometimes in a sunny hour she dreams
Ashore, where jungle courts the shell-
pricked reach.
Afloat once more before old trades she seems,
Or in some reed-walled creek Swings to the
beach,
While, where the vine across the cave mouth
lies,
Glow the twin lamps of lurking golden eyes.
Scarlet hibiscus and gay orchid shapes
Flash like a note of passion through the
trees,
And pal-m crests scrawl their runes above the
capes f
As though to write a legend of the seas,
And, brown and amber, to her shining sides
Stray cocoanuts are bobbing with the tides.
And one slim native girl with little feet,
Smelling of groves of orange trees in
bloom,
Threads through the tale a laughter low and
sweet,
And sudden heart-throbs pulsing in the
gloom,
To stealthy tryst the barefoot seamen move
While lifts a yellow moon to shame their love.
Faint musk-breaths drift like kisses on the
_ night,
A bird forgets the dark and chants of day,
On coral tips the breaker curls are white,
And phosphorescence streaks the livid bay,
A shark’s pale belly in the shallows gleams,
And brave she rides —a derelict of dreams !
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, February 7, 1914.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
The Chiel and Lady Macgregor are doing
a round of shows in the Downs, what time
the \ ision and the Paget child sojourn with
the Whites, of Pikedale. Goodness knows
what George and Mary would do without an
energetic plenipotentiary here. How the
shows and other things would be opened
passes ray comprehension.
The new mayoresses of Brisbane and Bris-
bane South are Mrs. Jenkinson and Mrs.
Allen respectively. The former was a Miss
Ferguson, daughter of the late Lieutenant-
Colonel Ferguson, of Gympie. She is the
mother of five sturdy young Australians.
Mrs. Allen has spent 32 years in Banana-
land’s capital since she was born in Devon-
shire.
The National, Agricultural and Industrial
Association has appointed J. Bain, at present
secretary of the Bathurst Society, as its new
secretary. He is a Brisbane man, and, like
all Brisbane men, is full of energy and
hungering after hard work and lots of it.
The John Hicks entertained a party of
youth and more or less beauty aboard their
motor-launch the other day, in honor of the
two Hicks, daughters, Beatrice and Gladys,
who are off to Melbourne next week.
Mr. and Mrs. William Thorne had a
houseful of visitors to-day, to bid them good-
bye before they sailed for England. The
ceremony was conducted without a hitch.
Mrs. Malcolm Cameron, wife of the well-
known medico, departs for Canada next
week, and yesterday Mrs. Goddard handed!
afternoon tea to some 20 females in celebra-
tion thereof. Son Dudley will go along
with his mother, so that Canadian relatives;
may see what a young Northern Australian t
really looks like after struggling with the •
climate.
No less than six members of the Wimmen’s >
Club are flitting overseas this month. The
survivors will cheer them up next Thursday,.
with buns and the hot brown liquid sub-
stance that Dr. Dictionary Johnson drank
out of a “dish.”
Captain and Mrs. Svensen left by tie-
Mataram last Monday for the North, after,-
which they will take a short cut to Norway
through Siberia. They want to get to Nor-
way in time to assist that country to aele-
brate its separation from Sweden. Tbe-
Svensens live on the river-bank at East
Brisbane. Occasionally they break the ■
monotony with bacon and eggs, but the river- -
bank is an established habit.
The Teronga Bowling Club fed a quantity
of females on the green last Saturday..
President Denny Day Was ill, so, in his ab-
sence, bacteriological Pound grasped the •
hands of all the guests, and passed them on r
to Mrs. and Miss Day. John Reid, president ;
of the Q.8.A., made a few remarks, after
which the guests were recompensed with re-
freshments.
Last Saturday the Hospital Saturday/
Association massed itself on board the;
Lucinda and went exploring down the river
with its life in its hand. The most tiresome
feature of the affair was that the Lucinda
still berths, at its old objectionable resting
place, and is reached by a dust-strewn route
festooned with garbage vans. Any allegedly
clean country in the world would obliterate
either the Lucinda or the rubbish carts, and
plant a few trees on the river frontage. But
we can’t have everything. We already have
the Ena and the Heatherington and a pro-
spective motor-car for aldermen, so no one
can say we are not progressive.
Dulcie Peterson, an attractive girl who
sings and elocutes especially well, has hung
out her sign as teacher of the art. She
studied in your harbor settlement under
Frank Down and Harry Leston, and is one
of the few who do not consider it necessary
to punctuate their recitations with screams.
Tours affectionately
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Bananaland’s Minister for Agriculture
White, who some time back bewailed that
Queensland was not well adapted for agri-
culture, took advantage of the vacation to
accept a pressing invitation to inspect the
Central district. That his visit was profit-
able was evident from the astonishment with
which he viewed acres and acres of Rhodes
grass, lucerne, maize, cane and wheat, which
had taken the place of heavy scrub. One
farm showed a paddock of 15 acres of
Rhodes grass, which had supported 45 head
of cattle through the six driest months of
last year, and which when the rain came
had to be still more heavily stocked to keep
the grass down. Another showed lucerne
that had been five years in the ground, and
was at the time of the visit carrying a four-
weeks’ crop over 2ft. high. When White'
returned to the town in the corner of the-
State which pretends to know all about the'
half-million square miles which it likewise'
pretends to govern, he sat down to seriously
consider whether it wouldn’t be as well for
the Minister for Agriculture to spend a few
days in the country now and then; or if he
didn’t he should have done so.

Hunyadi Janos
Indiscretions of diet are the most frequent cause of liver complaints.
Other contributing factors are excess of alcohol and lack of exercise.
To safely and speedily overcome such a condition there is no better
remedy than the taking of a wine-glassful of Hunyadi Janos Natural
Aperient Water before breakfast every day for a week or fortnight,
which has the happy effect of relieving in an almost instantaneous
manner any congestion of the liver.
Hunyadi Janos is obtainable at all chemists.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Ferdie: Smartly written ; but too small a
local disturbance to write about.... B1I: Don’t be
afraid. We never say anything unpleasant in this
column. When we want to otter a would-be contri-
butor real discouragement, we drop him a note
written in blood with an axe... .Anxious: Sorry we
have no information about that faraway Pani Ilota
show... .A.M.M.: Glad to hear from you if you
will tell us something that every other person who
has rushed into the Great Fog hasn’t tried to tell
us already. .. .T.D.J.: It’s Sunday-afternoon, and
company-manners name is iguana. Other times it’s
gohanna or just g 0... . Inquirer: Apparently it is an
unregistered partnership ; and the partners may make
what rules they like for the conduct of their busi-
ness.... D. Day: “Margarey Daw” appeared in
“Under a Fool’s Cap,” by Daniel H. Holmes, re-
printed by Mosher, Portland, Maine, U.S.A The
Pigeon: Full particulars of Hodder and Stoughton’s
prize novel competition, closing March 31, 1914,
appeared in lied Page, March 27, 1913 —one condition
being that MS. must be accompanied by a filled-in
printed form, to be obtained from H. and S
Brookfield: Your vague suspicion that Quinn wrote
“The Camp Within the West” is correct. Get “The
Hidden Tide,” from any bookseller. .. .The Native:
“Eaglehawk and Crow,” by G. Mathew, contains a
largie number of abo. words with their meanings.
But why not be original and name your villa “The
Laurels” ? Also, “Hazel Dell” hasn’t been used
before... .Lantern: Ask Angus and Robertson, Syd-
ney. .. .D.F.G.: Maybe you’re right, but we haven’t
seen it before. There are very few sub-editors' who
have seen everything that has been printed....
F.J.E.G.: Don’t see that it throws any new light on
the question.... Faux Pas: Can’t see your point....
Red Gum: There should be a paragraph in it, but
you haven’t made it clear. What do you mean when
you say that “the contractor knocks off 7d. for the
use of his name” ? Who does he knock it off, and
what is his name (Smith, perhaps), and what kind
of a riot does he have on 7d. ?. .. . Domremi: The
fact that the freehold land of the Territory and the
areas held on long lease are mostly in the North is
a good reason why the great Federal property should
be opened from the South, by extending the Port
Augusta-Oodnadatta railway northward over the cool
table-land and starting settlement at the Alice Springs
end. But even the great estates can be broken up for
closer settlement purposes when the country is made
accessible —if any government really wants to break
them up. There are such things as graduated land-
tax and compulsory resumption. .. .Doubter: It is a
pity that the Abo-scribes don’t get together and
agree to tell the same yarn. The sturdy bushwoman,
and the overflowing bush hospitality, and the bush
helpfulness (as evidenced by the occasion when Rain-
bow was in the Yard), and the kindly bush doctor
and nurse —we have heard of them all. And we
really believe in them. Now you want an increased
baby bonus on the ground that the doctor is a
hunks and the nurse a cormorant. And you say
that the mother, when she goes to the nearest town-
ship to be confined, has to pay heavily for someone
to mind the children because the neighbor is a
harridan who will do nothing without payment.
Also the sturdy mother herself —wife of the cocky
who has got rich by “poling” on the swagman—is
so weak. from chronic hunger that she isn’t fit for
maternity. These things are hard to sort 0ut....
Jugend: Try a less religious print. Possibly some
trade journal like the Plumbers and Gasfitters’
Gazette might like it... .E.F.S.: You approach
Nature as if she were Jane Smith. .. .Johnnie H.
(V.) : Well, you get a good grip on the subject, but
you don’t score a fall. .. .L.J.V.: River song dies
away to a trickle. ... G.B. (W.A.): Both outed. .. .
Jack P. (M.L.): Nothing. ... Phoebe T. E. (M.L):
Regret unsuitable. ... Stewart C. R.: Gome in and
sit down: —•
AUSTRALIA’S HOME.
Australia is a friendly mate
Some day its fleet may be very great,
At the Harbor entrance she stands
Like Horatious at the gate,
She fights for love of country,
To uphold her wealth and fame
Like the good old dogs of Devon have
Made old England’s name,
Each boy must have a certain
night,
To learn for his counUv how to
tight,
.If e’er a foe dared our home to plunder,
They’d get the lead as strong as
thunder.
....Spider: Just cobwebs. .. .G. A. (Waverley) :
Nothing usable in the batch. .. .Edward II.: N 0....
Charles M.: Fails gracefully... .J.M.S. (Brisbane):
“A mighty nation guarded bv her wardogs of the
sea. A people strong”— : — Here, when is this sort
of thing going to stop?. . . .Fred X. (S.A.) : It’s com-
plete in its way :
JANE’S BEAU.
Jane had a beau,
You know!
Oh yes, she had a beau !
And this beau Jane had made an awful blunder;
But taking into consideration the way Jane led him
on, it wasn’t much wonder! (Stop here for
refreshments !)
So—
You know,
Jane hasn’t got a beau!
Oh, no !
No more Beau for Jane!
Certainly not 1
It’(isn’t safe!
. ...R.E.T.: Too diffuse. .. .P.E.M.: You’re mistaken
—there isn’t any devil in it.... Some Pencil Fiend:
We read enough of it. . . .Johnnie C.: No use. .. .
George B. (M.L.) : Same old line of goods. .. .Ped:
It arrives nowhere. .. .E.F.S. : “Call” has no print
value. . . .C.E H.: Nothing enticing in batch. . . .Hare
H. (M.L.) : Not sufficient interest... .J.W.M. : Treat-
ment isn't strong enough. . . .Z. (V.) : Sell your type-
writer .. . ..Austra: Sorry you can’t pick us up with
this rhymed item. Why not try some plain descrip-
tive prose about your job. It must be an interest-
ing one. .. .R.H.: Poor stuff. . . .Killie: You’ve got a
heavy touch ...W.S:B.: Thoroughly depressing item.
. . . .Printer: The Sal. Army “home” at Brisbane was
filled with women who were supposed to have been
“rescued” from the flames of perdition. And three
of them were burned because the Army didn’t know
enough about the job of rescuing People from flames
to supply the necessary apparatus. We have only
the Army’s word for the perdition and the suffici-
ency of its holy appliances, but if the arrangements
we can’t see are judged by those we can see, it is
an inefficient old show, and snuffles under false
pretences.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Dave H.: Drawings are painful to witness and the
gags are old. . . .L.G.P.: Crude, hard work. You
need training. Humor rather conventional....
W.E.G.: What you can’t draw you leave out or
slur. The result is eminently unsatisfactory from
an art point of view W.B. (M.L): Miniature
hairline stuff —the unsaleable product of the untrained
amateur experimenter. Of course, you didn’t really
expect those jokes to be used —we refer particularly
to the St. Peter item, and the one attached to the
drawing of the distorted latlies swimming. .. .J.A.
fV.): Traces of humor about the vice-regal picture,
though the potentate in the cocked hat is outrageous.
The coroneted lady yawning politely is the best of
it, though even she has a slight hump oh her dis-
tinguished back. The drunk is hopeless from all
angles. Buy some tuition... .W.R.S.: Young man,
something heavy will fall on you if you send us
any more such atrocities!.... Eric D.: You are
young, and don’t know how to go about things....
JM. (at least it looks more like “J.M.” than any-
thing else) : You have no sense of humor, you can’t
draw, and you can't sign your name legibly. Can
you chop wood, or clean windows, or howl for theatre
cabs? If you can do any of these things really
well, you had better give up Art.

The J?em/n§tonrUMC Trade Mark
What It Means to You
Behind every trade mark that really
amounts to anything, there are
brains, energy, ambition, and work—
hard work —joined hand in hand to
produce some article of worth that
will deserve and win universal ap-
proval. After a manufacturer h ? s
spent a great many years in organiz-
ing his business and perfecting his
product his name and his trade
mark amount to something worth
while, or else he has toiled in vain.
The Remington-UMC trade mark is
the directing finger pointing the way
to arms and ammunition of quality
and dependability. The favor which
they find among the discriminating
sportsmen "everywhere tell us that
we have not toiled in vain and that
the old trade mark symbolizes the
best guarantee in the world—the

Two years ago we took on a Sole Agency
calling for an enormous output of Diamonds,
and, with a view to making the turnover, we
offered them at merely a broker’s commission
on the Antwerp cutters’ cost.
It hardly paid us the first year; the second
year, the sales were so great, it did better,
and we are trying it for another year.
We only stock the best grades of Diamonds,
but our prices for these are THE LOWEST.

EXPERIMENT.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
.halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, or younger years.

From George GeorgesOn, managing director Of
Anderson’s Tanneries, Ltd; (Sydney) : Referring to
“J.D.S.’s” letter (B. 8/l/’l4), our tannery manager,
Mr. R. J. Carter, after many years experience in
England, as well as itt hot and damp climates in
different parts of the World, has thoroughly mast-
ered the drying and other problems associated with
the turning out of highest quality leather in Aus-
tralia ; and whatever may be the results obtained
elsewhere in this country; the leather being manu-
factured by us at Botany is not only free from the
Weaknesses mentioned by “J.D S.,” but is in every
way equal to the best English, ample evidence of
which we shall be happy to have the opportunity of
giving “j.D.S.” And when we have furnished it we
shall be pleased to have his frank opinion as to
whether he has not found that Australia Can, and
is, turning out leather quite equal in color and in
every other Way to the best English. Then, like an
honorable man; we believe he will withdraw the
statement that “Australian leather is hot, and never
has been, equal to the best English leather.”
“Premium”: Sydney’s fire record for January was
275 alarms, mostly serious, the month finishing with
a huge conflagration at Snow’s fluff emporium. The
last few months have seen the brigades Working
bvertime, and the insurance CoS; are badly hit. The
underwriters make tio hostile insinuations against
anybody; but they instance as a remarkable fact
that the end of every boom is indicated, the world
Over, by a tremendous rate Of fire loss. In New
York the first intimation a few years back that
the boom period was finished was the unaccountable
increase of fires. The insurance people have already
summoned a meeting to discuss the whole position.
One idea is to make compulsory the use of auto-
matic fire-sprinklers and detector devices, a scheme
that finds much especial favor among the agents
who import these various contraptions.
“Hamer” : .An interesting point as to the right of
the finder of lost property to the advertised reward
was discussed at the Manly (N.S.W.) police court the
other day. A lady lost a diamond pendant, for which
she advertised a reward of £20. The finder, who
evidently knew the way of people who advertise in
this large and affluent fashion, took a friend along
with him to help him claim the subsidy. The owner
urged him to take part of the £20 in cash, and
accept an IOU for the balance; but he wanted the
lot in hard money. Experiencing a difficulty in col-
lecting it, he issued a summons. The owner con-
tended that the finder had acted illegally in not
handing the treasure to the police, a finder having
no right to retain such property ; but the Law held
that there was no wrong intention, and that the
advertisement amounted to a contract, which the
owner must fulfil.
* * * #
“Observer” : The Sugar Octopus is getting in some
work in the Mackay district (Q.). The old cane-
purchasing agreements between the co. and its
growers having expired, and the Sydney conference
having proved abortive, the co. has issued a circular
intimating the substitution of an “amended” agree-
ment for the ensuing three years. The farmers
are now spending many weary hours in chewing over
the amazing document. Its most outstanding fea-
ture is the deletion of what was known as the “B”
scheme, which fixed a base price for cane of a cer-
tain standard, with an increase in the price for
every decrease in the quantity required to make a
ton of sugar. This scheme was in operation
throughout the Mackay district last season. The
co. proposes to substitute a quality test, and. has
the calm effrontery to admit that the object is to
debar growers from benefiting by any improvement
which may be effected in the process of manufacture.
The circular goes on to state a case, pointing out
that a projected improvement that would have re-
sulted in an increase in profits had been abandoned
by the dog-in-the-manger co., because the farmers
stood to gain a trifle, without having contributed to
the capital outlay. If the company, having purchased
some improved process from the inventor at a very
moderate price, was willing to let a share of the
profits go to the cane-grower, the said grower would
be encouraged to grow more, and that would mean
more business and more profit for the octopus. But
when a concern gets so big in the stomach that it
hasn’t been able to see its own feet for 10 years, it
naturally doesn’t know where it is going.
* * * *
“Copper”: When is the Australian Government
going to get busy on the long-promised nickel coin-
age? The vast copper token the size of a sunset
which at present afflicts the community is an ana-
chronistic curse. Besides rendering it dangerous
for anyone with change for a shilling on him to
fall into the water, it has a fiendish habit of feeling
like half a crown in the pocket, and engendering a
spirit of reckless irresponsibility, only at the critical
moment, to confound its deluded possessor when he
produces it. Even potentates like Charles II. and
Bill of Orange had enough common-sense to issue
small pennies, and it’s up to George V. or Joe
MCGCLLXXVIII, to go and do likewise.

I THINK YOUR REMEDY A FINE ONE
Writes MISS MURIEL STARR.
This Brilliant Actress says she will never again travel
without a bottle of Dr. Sheldon s Now Discovery.
Miss Muriel Starr’s appearance in the
American drama “Within the Law” is
one of the sensational successes of the
Australian stage. She has had a wonder-
ful career of star-r6les in America. Her
Mary Turner in “Within the Law” has
afforded Australians merely an idea of the
work she is capable of doing. This re-
markable writes to the Sheldon
Drug Co., Ltd., as follows: —
SHELDON DRUG CO., LTD., Sydney.
Dear Sirs, —
I have been using your Dr. Shel-
don’s New Discovery for the past
week, and, although I have never
given a testimonial for anything before
in all my life, I feel that it is my duty
now to write and tell you what a splendid
Remedy I think Dr. Sheldon’s New Dis-
covery is. , , ..
I had such a nasty little cold, and it
bothered me so much and affected my voice
when speaking. I never was so annoyed before,
and I could not seem to get rid of it —some-
times it was a little better and then much
worse. At last I was told to try Dr. Sheldon’s
New Discovery, and I did, and I think it fine.
The very first dose eased my throat and helped
my voice, and now every trace of the cold is
gone. There was no getting better and
then worse again with that cold after start-
ing with New Discovery—l simply improved
right along, and I want to tell you that I
think your Remedy a fine one, and I
intend never to travel again without
a bottle in my grip.
Wishing New Discovery every sue-
C6SS
I am, sincerely yours,
(Sgd.) MURIEL STARR.
MISS MURIEL STARR,
(May and M. Moore photo.)

best known remedy for Coughs, Colds, Pleurisy,

The dreamt I dreamed, the dilly thorts I
Is up the U pole, an’ joy ’as done a bunk.
Wimmin! 0 strike! I orter known the
Their 11 tricks is crook, their arts is all
The ole world over tarts is all the same :
All soft an’ smilin wif no eait inside.
But she fair doped me wif er winnm ways,
Then eroded me pitch fer all me mortal days.
They’re all the same! A man ’as got to be
Stric’ master if ’e wants to snare em
sure. . , , ,
’E ’as to take a stand an let em see
That triflin’ is a thing e won t mdure.
’E wants to show ’em that e olds command,
So they will smooge an’ feed out ot is ana.
’E needs to make ’em feel ’e is the boss,
An’ keep the upper ’and in ev ry tilt.
’E ’as to make ’em think ell feel no loss
To part wif any tart ’e s trackin wit.
That all their pretty ways is crook pretense
Is plain to any bloke wif common sense.
But when the birds is nestin in the spring,
An’ when the soft green leaves is in the
bud, _ _
’E drops ’is bundle to some fluffy thing,
’E pays ’er ’omage —an’ ’is name is Mud.
She plays wif ’im an’ kids ’ini on a treat,
Until she ’as ’im crawlin’ at ’er feet.
An’ then, when ’e’s fair orf ’is top wif love,
When she ’as got ’im good an’ ’ad ’er fun,
She slings ? im over like a carst-orf glove,
To let the other tarts see wot she’s done.
All vanity, deceit an’ ’eartless kid .
I orter known; an’, spare me days, I did.
I knoo. But when I looked into ’er eyes—
Them shinin’ eyes o’ blue all soft wit
love —
Wif mimic love —they seemed to lpnertize.
I wus content to place ’er ’igh above,
I wus content to make of ’er a queen ;
An’ so she seemed them days....O, strutli
... .Doreen !
I knoo. But when I stroked ’er glossy ’air
Wif rev’rint ’ands, ’er cheek pressed close
to mine,
Me lonely life seemed robbed of all its care;
I dreams me dreams, an’ ’ope begun to
shine.
An’ when she ’eld ’er lips fer me to kiss. . . .
Ar, wot’s the use? I’m done wif all o’ this!
Wimmin! Oh, I ain’t jealous! Spare me
days!
Me? Jealous of a knock-kneed coot like
that! ,
Tm ! Wif ’is cute stror ’at an’ pretty ways!
I’d be a mug to squeal or whip the cat.
I’m glad, I am — glad ’cos I know I’m free!
There ain’t no call to tork o’ jealousy.
I tells meself I’m well out o’ the game ; ;
Fer look, I mighter married ’er —an
then....
Ah strike ! ’Er voice wus music when my
name .
Wus on ’er lips on them glad ev nm s
when
We useter meet. An’ then to think shed
g 0....
No, I ain’t jealous—but—Ar, I dunno !
I took a derry on this stror-’at coot
First time I seen ’im dodgin’ ’round
Doreen.
Tm, wif ’is giddy tie an’ Yankee soot,
Ferever yappin’ like a tork-machine.
About “The Iloffis” where ’e ’ad a grip....
The way ’e smiled at ’er give me the pip !
She ses I stoushed ’im, when I promised fair
To chuck it, even to a friendly spar.
Stoushed ’im! I never roughed ’is pretty
’air!
I only spanked ’im gentle, fer ’is mar.
If I’d ’a’ jabbed ’im once, there would ’a’
been
An inquest; an’ I ses so to Doreen.
I mighter took an’ cracked ’im in the street,
When she wus wif ’im there lars’ Frid’y
night.
But don't I keep me temper when we meet?
An’ don’t I raise me lid an’ act perlite?
I only jerks me elbow in ’is ribs
To give the gentle office to ’is nibs.
Stoushc-d ’im! I owns I met ’im on the
quite,
An’ worded ’im about a small affair;
An’ when ’e won’t put up ’is ’ands to fight
(’E ses, “Fer public brawls ’e didn’t
care”) —
I lays ’im ’cross me knee, the mother’s joy,
An’ smacks ’im ’earty, like a naughty boy.
An’ now Doreen she ses I’ve broke me vow,
An’ mags about this coot’s poor, “wounded
pride.”
An’ then, o’ course, we ’as a ding-dong row,
Wif ’ot an’ stormy words on either side.
She ses I done it outer jealousy.
An’ so, we parts fer ever —’er an’ me.
Me jealous! Jealous of that cross-eyed
cow!
I set ’im ’cos I couldn’t sight ’is face.
’ls yappin’ fair got on my nerves, some-ow.
I couldn’t stand ’im ’angin’ round ’er
place.
A coot like that! But it don’t matter
much.
She’s welkim to ’im if she fancies such.
I swear I’ll never track wif ’er no more;
I’ll never look on ’er side o’ the street —
Unless she comes an’ begs me pardin’ for
Them things she said to me in angry ’eat.
She can’t ixpeck fer me to smooge an’
crawl.
I ain’t at any woman’s beck an’ call.
Wimmin! I’ve took a tumble to their game.
I’ve got the ’ole bang tribe o’ diners set!
The ’ole world over they are all the same:
Crook to the core the bunch of ’em —an’
yet
We could ’a’ been that ’appy, ’er an’ me ... •
But wot’s it matter? Ain t I glad I m free.
A bloke wif commin-sense ’as got to own
There’s little ’appiness in married life.
The smoogin’ game is better left alone,
Fer tarts is few that make the ideel wife.
An’ them’s the sort that loves wifout dis-
guise, . ■ , , ~
An’ thinks the sun shines in their usband s
eyes.
But when the birds is matin’ in the spring,
An’ when the tender leaves begin to bud,
A feelin’ comes—a dilly sorter thing—
That seems to sorter swamp 1m like a
flood. ,
An’ when the fever ’ere inside 1m burns, ,
Then freedom ain’t the thing fer wot e
yearns.
But I ’ave chucked it all. An’ yet--I own
I dreams me dreams when soft Spiing
breezes stirs;
An’ often, when I’m moonin ere alone,
A lispin’ maid, wif ’air an’ eyes like ers,
’Oo calls me “dad,” she climbs upon me
An’ yaps ’er pretty baby torli to me.
I sorter see a little ’ouse, it seems,
Wif Someone waitin’ for me at tne
Ar, where’s "the sense in dreamin’ barmy
dreams ?
I’ve dreamed before, an’ nearly woke too
late. , .
Sich ’appiness could never last fer j ol i g ’ ,
We’re strangers —’less she owns that she
was wrong.
To call ’er back I’ll never lift a ’and ;
She’ll never ’ear frum me by word or sign.
P’raps, some day. she’ll come to understand
The mess she’s made o’ this ere life o
mine. T , ~
Oh, I ain’t much to look at, 1 admit.

Dinnigan’s Dice-box.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THIS tale with the alliterative title has
to do with a certain fleshy publican
named Dinnigan; a good-natured
sinner named Scobie; a ruby-red mare
known as Flash Jenny, the property of
Dinnigan ; and a well-used dice-box with a
rough exterior, also portion of the publican s
worldly goods. . , , , ~0
This ungodly conglomeration had tor its
headquarters the Here-At-Last Inn, a cer-
tain payable shanty situated upon the
Murrumbidgee at a point where four roads,
reaching far away into the very farthest
back, met and discharged a continuous cargo
of heat-warped, thirsting souls. At the
ever-open door they would meet the readily
outstretched hand of Dinnigan, the landlord
and owner, and later on his just as readily
outstretched boot if they outlasted their
cash. All kinds of men came off the hot,
red road to breast the deal bar of the Here-
At-Last. There were decent men, perma-
nent hands at the stations, who shouted a
few times and rode away; hard cases, who
had been kicked out by Dinnigan, after he
had gathered in all but the things they stood
in, on an average once a year for the last
15 years; travellers of all kinds from beyond
the wide mirage-covered plains; restless
souls who tramped everlastingly through the
hazy heat towards an eternally indefinite
destination; sharps and spielers, who came
to prey upon the unwary; and lastly Scobie,
that modern Robin Hood of Farthest Back,
who came to prey in turn upon the spieler
push as the tiger preys upon the jackal,
with a contemptuous chuckle for his victim
but a bit of keen advice and a pound or so
for the bitten lamb. Scobie spieled only
upon his brother spieler.
Dinnigan’s mare was an extremely pre-
possessing piece of goods, and knew it. She
came of a famous trotting breed, and her
pace and style suggested great possibilities
to the active mind of Scobie. Ihe animal
had proved a gold mine till she became so
well known that she could no longer be
exploited locally, and as Dinnigan was a
fixture the animal was therefore now ot no
real value to him. Scobie wanted her, and
Dinnigan wanted to sell her; but the pub-
lican’s price was high, and Scobie s was
practically nothing. The fact that Scobie
wanted the steed was a source ot no little
anxiety to the owner. Scobie had a way ot
getting things he wanted at the price he
wanted to give, and Dinnigan found the pio-
cess of keeping one eye on the mare and the
other on Scobie very wearying. To end the
suspense he lowered the price of the mare
and offered her to the genial scamp; but the
latter winked with the reassuring remark
that he intended to get _ her for miles less
than that figure. Dinnigan put an extra
lock on the stable door and made the stable-
hand sleep in the harness-room, which ad-
joined the mare’s loose-box, and lost torn
hours’ sleep a night worrying over the mat-
Tliere was but one other building at the
Cross-Roads besides the shanty, and it was
occupied by a harness-maker _ named Nick-
son, who made a very fair living by making
and repairing harness and saddlery tor the
stations and travelling teams. Nickson was
a quiet sort of a fellow, with a keen regard
for Scobie, who had in the dim past rescued
him from the clutches of the fraternity and
set him up in the rough iron liut he called
his shop. In fact, Scobie was sleeping pait
ner in the business. When things were
quiet at the Here-At-Last he was wont to
stroll across to the harness-mender s tor a
yarn, and the saddler would retail the latest
gossip from the stations —which often con-
tained information of great professional in-
terest to the bush freebooter. # It was on the
occasion of just such a visit that fccohie,
dreamily taking his pipe from his mouth,
made a proposal to the man of leather and
wax-end.

Chamberlain's
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy.
This is the best medicine procurable for bowel complaint in all its forms. It
relieves pain in the stomach, dysentery, diarrhoea and colic. It has been the means
of saving more pain and suffering than any other known remedy. Thousands of
mothers in all parts of the world have given it to their children and now sing its
praises. This medicine is especially valuable in checking Diarrhoea which nearly
always attacks the babies when teething. One dose will relieve pains in the stomach
and it seldom takes more than three or four doses to stop a severe attack of Diarrhoea.
Always take Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy at the first unusual
looseness of the bowels. There is no class of ailments that attack the system quicker
than bowel complaints and when a medicine is wanted it is wanted quickly. What
has made Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy so popular is that the relief
is just as quick. It is a medicine that should be kept in the home at all times and we
advise you to procure a bottle at once, for it will save trouble later on and perhaps be
the means of saving a life.

The most persistent and troublesome ail-
ment known —the cause of headache and
languid feeling —the forerunner of many
diseases is cured by Chamberlain’s Tab-
lets. Then most of the other ailments
vanish because nature has a free chance to
work. Chamberlain’s Tablets are a
simple and reliable remedy.
Nicky,” he said, “I want you to make
me a dice-box.”
The saddler reached out for his leather.
“Hold on,” said Scobie. “D’you know
much about dice-boxes, Nicky?”
“Not ’§ piuch ft s you do, I guess,”
turned the leather man with a grin. “Why?”
Scobie blew a ring, jabbed the stem of his
pipe through it, and replied, “There are lots
of sorts of dice-boxes, Nicky, but they boil
down to two kinds—straight and crook ones.
I ve had a bit of experience of both sorts”—
the saddler grinned as he bent over his work
and so I’ll give ye a hint or so. When
ye go to use a box, Nicky, run your finger
around the inside. If you feel any little
ridges or such like in it, don’t throw dice
that night— not with that box, anyhow
Ye fell in once, ye know.” The mate looked
up, suddenly.
“So they rung in a crook box on me, did
they? he asked.
“They did so, me lad. Now, a straight
box is just plain inside —no bumps or any-
thing—just the even face; but a crook box
is smooth and shiny ’s a bottle, with one or
two > little details besides. Take hold of this
box Scobie took a dice-box from his
pocket and tossed it to the cobbler. “Hold
it ’s if you were going to throw. Ah:
1 nought so.”
‘‘Thought what f”
“Ye’d probably never notice that pretty
well every new-chum that gets hold of a
leather dice-box turns it so that the seam
is nearest him. Your crook knows that, and
he takes good care that the dice will have a
good, smooth run out. The new-chum gives
the box a good shake so as to make sure,
slides the dice out, and throws a one or a
two, just like you’re going to do now.”
‘All right. What does the crook do when
he throws?”
“I’H ye- Tli’ inside of that box is
prepared. Knowin’ that the new-chum will
tern the seam to him, he leaves the part
of the box that will be downward clean and
smooth ; but on the other side he cuts what
he calls a ditch —just a long sort of a de-
pression crossways inside, below the
middle. Of course the dice are loaded. Th’
crook turns the seam away from him, rattles
the dice same as the lamb did, and rolls it
'^l ien the edge of the dice touches the
ditch the dice rolls over, slides over the lip
of the box, ’nd shows a pretty six, or there-
abouts, every time. Very simple, ain’t it?”
Well, so was I simple to be took in like
that. What about this box you want me
to make? D’yer want a crook one?”
“Wait on. Dinnigan’s got a box that’s
the squarest thing about him, ’nd I want
to get hold of it for half an hour. He keeps
it locked up, and when anyone asks for it
v*7u Wa^c^es like a cat watching a sparrow.
What I want ye to do, Nicky, is to make
me one exactly like it. Now, ye’ll need to
have a good look at it first, so we’ll go
across and toss who shouts, and we’ll ask
Dinnigan to let us use his box. His dice
are all square, too, so I’ve got to change
em. Ive done it before ’nd he didn’t get
wise. When he hands the box out get its
photo on y’ brain, and make me a copy
Come along.”
Dinnigan was in the bar wiping glasses
when the two marched in, and at Nickson’s
request he handed the box over. It was
old, and one or two almost obliterated gold
letters showed that the owner’s name had
been on it in its palmy days. Nickson took
the box, turned it over a couple of times
and commented upon its shabby appearance.
Its th straightest box hereabouts, f’r all
its looks, me boy,” replied its owner. “She
may be a bit wore outsoide, but she’s hon-
est insoide —eh, Scobie?”
* mas ter, like servant, Dinny,” re-
sponded Scobie with gentle sarcasm. “Don’t
be all night lookin’ at th’ flamin’ old thing,
Nicky. Give it a rattle.”
A few minutes later the pair were hard
at it in the shop. Like a flash the new box
took shape. The stitching was put in un-
waxed ; letters corresponding to the ones
on the original were carefully gilded on;
the out-side surface was scored with
scratches according to the direction of the
exacting Scobie, who knew the appearance
11 i Y - er / dlce ' box within miles by heart-
all kinds of disfiguring stains were artfully
reproduced and finally the box was
here and smoothed there and
finished off with a rubbing with sand from
tne road till Scobie pronounced the job
complete. Then again they sauntered over
to the Here-At-Last.
Dinnigan was absent, and the kitchen girl
was in charge—an arrangement that ap-
pealed to Scobie as fortunate. At the lat-
ter s request she opened the locker and
handed over the box. Like a flash it was
in Scobie s pocket, and the dummy stood on
the bar counter with three faked dice rest-
telly reposing within it. Thev tossed, and
Scobie paid. A few seconds later the box
of fair fame was having a rough time of it
m the cobbler’s shop. Two slashes with the
Jteffe, and the stitching was through and
the. box spread out. Scobie marked the
position of the ditch with a pencil, and
Nickson cut it out. Back went the stitch-
ing, with a final roughening of sand, and
the companions in conspiracy stood in the
ten of. Dinnigan for a third drink. The
girl opined that they were going it.
‘There’s more in the inside of that box
of Dinny s than he told us of,” chuckled
Scobie as. they returned to the shop. “Now.
Nicky-me-lad, I’ll let ye into th’ know. Of
course y’ mind the red mare, Flash Jenny.
Lhnmgan s raffling her —he seems scared
about her and wants to get her off. He’s
got all the tickets off —hundred at a quid.
I happen to know that the mare’s th’
sweetest thing for the trotting meeting at
VVarra next week, so I’ve decided to take
her there, followin’ th’ season along after-
wards. She’s to be raffled to-night, and so’s
all is to be square ’n above-board Dinny’s
box and dice is to be used. Th’ girl told
me who the tickets ’ve gone to. There’s
thirty holders. I took five. Wolfie’s gang
hold pretty well the lot—sort of syndicate.
Of course they expect to get her, and they’ve
arranged to run her at all the country
shows where she isn’t known under another
name. The girl told me. Dinny’s in with
them. They arranged the whole thing this
mornin, and Dinny let ’em handle the box
and bones so’s they wouldn’t think there
was any hanky. O’ course everyone knows
Dmnys box is dead square. It’s been above
suspicion for fifteen years. I got my tickets
last, so I come last in the throwing. Lord:
won’t their eyes shine when they see me
drive away. Of course there’s a chance”-
thSc kSCm leap i excited ly to his feet. “Th’
things no good to you, Scobie,” he cried.

1 hat night the ganv rolled up in strength
to the bar at the Here-At-Last, and excite-
ment . ran high. The adherents of Wolfie
were in high fettle and confident, and Scobie
came in for a good deal of malicious chaff-
alf’ ThA C i' w£ te m that S e nt!en.an not at
a )K, Thft ticket-holders crowded the bar-room,
whilst the solitary lamp outside shed a
gloomy glimmer over a throng of travellers
and boundary-riders, filling the rOle of in-
si)ectators - Dinnigan cleared the
ountei of a swarm of glasses, wiped the
beer-froth from the deal surface, and then
took dS n»i d th d f'n 110 ’ 6 ’, opened the locker and

stepped up, produced tickets one to five, rat-
tled the dice and threw. The three bones

Ibis time he got seven, the next throw five
a„ain ; then six, followed by three ones. He
threw the box on the counter, spat on the
doai ln ais £ust, and moved away

ingly. Henderson muttered and moved
uwuy.
Stilfy Lane followed Henderson with the
bones, and did about as well. Matherson
(otherwme the Scotch Shark) followed him,
and his highest throw was eight, and even
that was challenged immediately by Nick-
son, who owed the Shark a grudge, and
raucously accused him of turning one of the
d f CG A be e<^ge the box after it had
stopped. A row ensued, during which the
saddler, not being a ticket-holder, and there-
fore not privileged to give any opinion what-
ever on the proceedings, was hustled to the
dooi. and pushed through it, tumbling back-
wards over the step and falling into the
stablemans bucket, which had been left in
an absurd position too near the door. From
J on tke excitement grew rapidly as one
attei another of the gang tried his luck with
disastrous results. One furious thrower
c . a^e ug e d the box. Dinnigan withered him
with the remark that »s he had never before
touched an honest box, he couldn’t expect
to do any good with that one—“Th’ sthraight-
es.t °wid box in th’ blanky district—to H—l
wid him ’ One by one the gang went down,
till at last they were all through, and 15
was the highest throw amongst them. Then
►.cobie, nonchalantly chewing a straw, and
with face peacefully immobile, stepped for-
ward and threw down his tickets. The crowd
pressed around, Nickson, standing on a box
outside, glared anxiously through the top
iail of the window. Scobie rattled the
dice, shoved his left hand in his pocket,
flipped the straw to the opposite corner of
nis mouth with his tongue and threw—
three. The crowd gasped with relief, while
Nickson skipped off the box with a vocifer-
ous curse, spitefully punched his leg, swore
again, and remounted the box to glare at
the next throw. Scobie imperturbably re-
placed the dice and threw again—-another
three. The gang began to smile its relief,
and the saddler jumped off the box in a
frenzy of rage, landing on a boundary-rider’s
uog, and thereby immediately becoming im-
broiled in a controversy that nearly pre-
vented him remounting his box in time for
the next throw. Sco.bie threw seven, and
never turned a hair. His fourth throw
showed a total of 12, and Wolfie and co.
simmered good humor what time Nicky’s
face at the window grew white. And then
all craned forward for the last throw. Im-
perceptibly, Scobie turned the box in his
hand till the seamy side was nearest him.
There was perfect silence in the room,
through which.the impatient pawing of the
ruby-red mare sounded like the beating of a
drum. The dice rattled in the box; the
crowd held its breath; slowly he tilted the
box, and then
“Stand back, boys,” murmured Scobie.
1 am t hardly got room to throw.”
The overwrought Dinnigan turned like a
bull on the audience. “For th’ sake ov God,
get back ahnd give th’ malm his chance,” he
bellowed, and the gang moved with scarce
a sound. Scobie again rattled the box,
flipped the straw to the other side of his
mouth, shoved his left hand into his trousers-
pocket, and threw.
There was a yell of blasphemy from the
watching gang, and Nickson fell off his box.
Hitter, hawkish faces hurled recrimination
at , the „ careless figure that smiled good-
naturedly at them through the execration,
bellowing his imprecations, the landlord
hurled the box and bones into the locker, and
slammed and locked the door; whilst out-
side the travellers, with whom Scobie was
a general favorite, applauded, assisted bv a
swarm of dogs.
“Boys,” said Scobie, genially, “I’m leaving
straight away for a little drive, and I won’t
be back for a month or so f but before I go
have one with me.”
He had thrown 18.
* * * *
The following morning, as Nickson was
bending over a saddle he was repairing, a
huge bulk darkened his doorway, and he
looked up and beheld the landlord of the
Here-At-Last glowering grimly upon him.
Mormn, Mr. Dinnigan.” said Nickv
pleasantly. “Wantin’ anything?”
. “T is - Oi want yez to make me a dice-
box, replied the publican. “A good, plain
box, wid an honest insoide. Oi want yez
to make it wid me name on it, loike”— and

Yours-or the other fellow s?
This is an age of progress. Invention is speeding up
production. Men are earning more because they
handle machines that produce more. The man who
wins out —or hopes to —must be equipped with the
best modern machines makers can provide. This year
will mean more prosperous times to you IF you take
time by the forelock and install better, faster and
more productive machinery in place of tools that
have had their day. Will you?
We illustrate the popular “Aster” Lathe. It has
sin. centres, runs in outside spring conical boxes, and
is provided with face ball bearings. It will cut
Whitworth and Metric pitches as well as gas-pipe
threads. It’s essentially a modern tool —but only one
of many our expert would like to explain to you.
Call if you can —write if you can’t. There’s no better
time than now.
