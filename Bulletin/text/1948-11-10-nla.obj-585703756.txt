Fountains Hall, The Pride of Jacobean Craftsmanship
HALL, five miles from Ripon, in Yorkshire, stands
in the beautiful valley of the Skell, within a few hundred yards
of the famous Fountains Abbey. Some of the materials used in
building this hall came from the ruins of the abbey, and today it
stands as one of the finest lacobean mansions in England. It was
built in 1610 by Sir Stephen Proctor, who chose so steep a site for
it that, while the south side is seen in the above picture, is five
storeys high from basement to attic, the north side has only two
ioreys showing above the ground.
The bold grouping of the high battlemented flanking towers and
the tiers of bay windows are notable features of the building. Above
the pillared entrance, which is on the basement level, are two stone
figures—recessed in the wall—which were at some time part of the
abbey. The tall oriel windows above these stone figures, and
reaching to the roof line, are those of the great drawing-room,
which has a particularly fine sixteenth-century stone mantelpiece.
Beneath the drawing-room is the Great Hall in the middle of the
house, across the west end of which runs a Minstrels’ Gallery.
In 1859 Fountains Hall was inherited by the Earl of Ripon.
The second Earl of Ripon was created a Marquis in 1871, but, his
son dying childless, the titles became extinct, then the estate passed
to Mr. Clare Vymer, the second son of Lady Alwyn Compton-
Vymer, great-granddaughter of the second Earl of Wrey.
In the beautiful valley of the Skell, near Fountains Hall and
Abbey, is Robin Hood’s Well, one of the traditional sites of the
encounter in which that noble outlaw was beaten and throwp into
a brook by the “Curtal Friar.” Also in the vicinity are the grounds
of Studley Royal, open to the public, which are among the finest
examples of Italian and Dutch formal gardening.

“STORM OF TIME.”
If you have a squatter, capable, power-
ful and ruthless, armed and supported by
armed retainers, and his security is
threatened by a solitary white man living
among the blacks, which of them would
kill the other? In Eleanor Dark’s Storm
of Time (Collins), a novel continuing the
historical sequence begun in Timeless
Land, the wild white man, Johnny Pren-
tice, kills the squatter, Stephen Mannion.
The deed is possible; its doing in the
novel is not without drama; yet the
scene, the climax of the book, leaves
one strangely unmoved. And this, surely,
is wrong: when a big man falls—hard,
cold and unpleasant though he may be—
one should feel something of the pathos
of ruined grandeur that even a falling
tree will arouse.
Would there have been a greater emo-
tional response if, as would be equally
likely, and perhaps more logically “in
character,” Stephen Mannion had killed
Johnny Prentice? It is a question that
can be answered only by going beyond
the confines of the novel: for the char-
acters are not developed enough for it to
matter—from the emotional, the dram-
atic, the artistic point of view—which of
them kills the other. As the book stands,
it would be much more interesting if the
convict Finn, who, having been sentenced
to barbarous floggings, has good reason
to hate Mannion, had been the murderer.
Mannion is, up to a point, a strong
piece of characterisation. Proud and un-
approachable, he very much resembles
Dickens’s Mr. Dombey, and Eleanor
Dark has had with him precisely the
trouble Dickens had with his immortal
predecessor: the problem of getting him
off his high horse; of making him
human.
What is set before the reader, in these
portraits of frozen arrogance, is the
mask a man wears in public: the
novelist’s difficulty lies in catching the
man off-guard for a moment, revealing
his underlying humanity. Eleanor Dark
has not taken advantage of her oppor-
tunities in Mannion’s relations with his
ex-convict mistress Ellen, in whose com-
remains as icily formal as when
visiting Governor Hunter or Governor
King. Mannion lacks positive qualities—
love for his land, love for a fine horse, a
touch of pleasure in the wine he is said
to drink—and at times, as when he is
said to select Irish convicts for his pro-
perty not from any feeling of kinship
but only because he regards the suppres-
sion of his own countrymen as of special
importance, or when he stamps on the
aboriginal servant-girl’s attempts to learn
the alphabet, his negative qualities of
coldness and inhumanity are over-
stressed to the point of caricature.
As a period figure, as an essence of
aristocratic ruthlessness, as a symbol of
the squattocracy, Mannion has weight;
but at the moment when he should be
weightiest, when his death should arouse
some profound emotion —be it satisfac-
tion or regret—one feels nothing. He has
not been portrayed “in the round” ; he
is not a human being; he is, essentially,
an abstraction.
It is difficult to make the killing of an
abstraction a moving climax to a novel,
and the task is made more difficult still
by the fact that Johnny Prentice can
hardly feel more than an abstract hatred
for Mannion. True, Johnny is the son
of Ellen, whom Mannion has made his
mistress; true again, he has memories of
oppression on the Mannion property.
But he ran away from home at the age
of eight to live with the blacks; he
shows little more than a dim curiosity
about his mother (who is stated in any
case to have found her relations with
Mannion by no means repugnant); and,
portrayed as so devoid of ordinary human
feelings that he cares nothing for his
aboriginal wife or the son she bears to
him, Johnny is not really convincing as
an incarnation of hatred. He has no
personal reason—no artistically satis-
fying reason—for hating Mannion at all.
, Jfknny, like Mannion, lives a kind of
half-life in the novel. Some of the
book s best writing centres about him, and
his life among the blacks —or, rather, in
solitude, for he lives apart from the
tribe—appeals to the imagination like
chapters of Robinson Crusoe: the picture
of man alone upon the earth. But hatred
7-even if there were good cause for it—
is an ugly emotion, undermining the
reason ; and Johnny, when after years of
supposedly brooding hatred in the bush
he at last murders the squatter, is not
ugly, not a maniac, but a figure of straw ;
an abstraction. A film could make the
murder an exciting scene; but it would
be melodramatic rather than genuinely
dramatic.
This story, the murder of Mannion by
Johnny, is the core of Storm of Time and
it is not so much a human drama as a
dramatisation of ideas. The murder is
not required by the logical movement of
character but by the author’s design for
a historical sequence in which Manning
representing the immigrant aristocracy,
must be killed off by the native-born
Johnny—son of convict parents and
comrade of the blacks —who, doubtless,
will be further developed in the next
volume as one of the inheritors of “the
timeless land.”
Storm of Time, then, is essentially the
sort of novel in which, as Norman Lind-
say once put it, “the action moves the
characters instead of the characters mov-
ing the action.” Whether they like it
or not, the characters must conform to
the pattern. A novel so constructed, in-
spired by an intellectual concept instead
of flowipg from delight in the strange,
tragic or comic behavior of individual
men and women, is not likely to enrich
the mind like a great human experience.
But the mind may also be enriched, or
clarified, ,by thought; and this is, very
likely, the only kind of novel Eleanor
Dark is able to write.
There is always a certain coldness in
her work. One may explain it partly by
the limitations of a clinical, a Freudian
approach, for Eleanor Dark takes her
people to pieces with skill and precision
—laying bare their" impulses towards
power and murder —but she is less suc-
cessful in the equally important process
of putting them together again as human
beings. Another explanation, also of
some validity, lies in the Leftist approach
by which the acquisition of wealth is
automatically assumed to be a proof of
villainy: an outlook which not only
affects the portrait of Mannion, but
which makes John Macarthur a curi-
ously remote and elusive figure in a novel
where, in conflict with three successive
Governors, he plays a very prominent
part. But, basically, the coldness is of
artistic temperament: as a writer Eleanor
Dark is more interested in ideas than in
people. Even her landscape, as in a
lengthy description of the blueness of the
Blue Mountains, is a kind of idea of
landscape, an intellectual concept; it does
not crackle with Australian heat but is
held up in a test-tube for chemical
analysis.
If the coldness is fundamental, not a
chill imposed on the writer’s talent but
the talent itself, all one can do, when its
limitations have been noted, is accept it.
For there is much worth accepting in this
novel. Within its confines, as a dramati-
sation of ideas, Storm of Time, like Time-
less Land , is an accomplishment of con-
siderable magnitude. Distinguished in
style, dispassionate on the whole in its
handling of historical personages, dis-
criminating in its choice of significant
national events and extraordinarily cap-
able m its interweaving of the personal
story with the record of the period, it
lingers in the mind as a monumental
teat of engineering: a span in a huge
bridge that, when completed, will stretch
from the beginnings of white settlement in
Australia to modern or at least recent
times.
There have been other such bridges in
Australian fiction, as well as in direct
history and biography. Some of Eleanor
Dark’s characters—Macarthur, Marsden,
Bligh have already been well docu-
mented, and it is difficult for any later
writer on the convict days to add any-
thing to Marcus Clarke and Ralph Rash-
leigh. It is a point worth noting that
Australian novelists very rarely deal with
history as the king of all historical
novelists, Walter Scott, did—in a spirit of
delighted fascination. The Australian,
inspired not so much by artistic delight as
by a disturbed social conscience, makes a
belated protest against the barbarities in-
flicted on the convicts and the blacks.
The result is a tradition which, seeking
to avoid the “illusion of romance,” in
Eleanor Dark’s phrase, is likely to slip
into another illusion of unvaried gloom
and misery, where men and women are
animated ideas and where not enough
regard is paid to the fact that laughter
and fortitude are also a part of reality.
One feels that Eleanor Dark has not
quite the Homeric detachment, by no
means incompatible with tragedy, which
regards the troubles of past generations
as “a song for the men to come.” A
theme reiterated throughout the book is
that “the wrong people were in fetters” ;
but why, at this date, seek to put anyone
in fetters? Doubtless the explanation for
this somewhat rancorous Australian tradi-
tion is that the convict days are still com-
paratively close to us and, with their
monstrous tyranny and cruelty, arouse a
passionate indignation. In spite of what
has previously been written on the sub-
ject there remains a demand—no doubt
a national need—for such historical epics.
They are a kind of expiation for past
misdeeds; and also —by deliberate and
profound design in Timeless Land and
Storm of Time —an analysis of the signi-
ficant elements of history and environ-
ment that go to make up the modern
Australian.
Not all the history in Storm of Time is
familiar, and even where the characters
have been widely discussed there is still
much interest in Eleanor Dark’s reassess-
ment. Marsden —that strange paradox of
“the flogging parson”—is disappointing;
he does not, in any case, play a great part
in the story. Macarthur, though one feels
that he has not been fully understood
and may have been treated with some in-
justice—did not his woolgrowing and
trading ventures, after all, benefit the
colony as he said they would? —is a
striking figure when he comes directly on
stage at last in his conflict with Bligh.
Governors Hunter and King, unremark-
able men, are remarkably well presented,
and Bligh, the liveliest figure in the book,
is completely convincing. Eleanor Dark’s
explanation of the famous “under the
bed” incident —an episode which was no
disgrace to Bligh, and which will one
day be used in fiction or drama simply for
what it was—uproarious comedy—is un-
doubtedly the right one; and one of the
book’s best scenes is when Bligh, con-
fronted with, a lampoon, suddenly stares
at nothing, seeing in his mind the face of
Fletcher Christian. Minor figures in the
novel such as Wentworth, the Rlaxlands,
Baudin and Flinders all come effectively
into the picture.
There is indeed something monumental
about such an achievement, and if there
is something cold about a monument, as
there is something mechanical about a
bridge, no generalisation is ever wholly
accurate. The mountain landscape on
page 221—gloomy, but justifiably so be-
cause it is the expression of a mood; the
convicts’ terror of the bush in which lies
their only hope of escape—is not a
chemical analysis but a living and
beautiful piece of earth. Mannion and
Johnny Prentice are, as has already been
said, at least partly effective, partly human
and never unimpressive. Conor, Man-
nion’s second wife, is chiefly a mouth-
piece for the author’s criticisms of the
brutalities of the period; yet, through
her, shadowy as she is, Eleanor Dark
brings the novel to its deepest humanity
and its most moving episode: when, in
Conor s attempts at sympathetic gestures
to the convict Finn, there is shown the
terrible, unpassable chasm between the
fettered convict and the representative,
however unwilling she may be, of the
tyranny that has chained him.
If there is no real laughter in the book,
and if the final effect remains chilly, that
is not quite the same thing as gloomy.
The underlying sombreness is lightened not
only by the political and social scenes in
Sydney and by the touches of charm in
the development of love between Conor
and Mannion’s secretary, but by an admir-
able attempt to present a balanced picture
of the convicts. There is no lively per-
sonality among them—Finn, the most
prominent, is hardly more than an em-
bodiment of the advanced ideas of the
period—but at least there are moments
when even men in chains respond to
humor, companionship or beauty, and
there is one unforgettably Australian
character, seen for an instant, whose
dream of freedom is to “sprawl all day
beneath a tree.” It is typical of the novel
that this man should be portrayed as a
tragic figure, yet typical of the depth and
range of the author’s intellect that the
attempt should be made to trace even this
aspect of the national character back to
its source in “the storm of time.”
The thought is deep and the range
comprehensive only within limits. Men
did not come to Australia only as tyrants
and their victims, but, in infinitely greater
numbers, as free men and gallant adven-
turers. But the limits are proper to The
Storm of Time , which deals with Sydney
and its neighborhood in the years from
Hunter to Bligh. The book, though of
course it comes within the broad defini-
tion of the novel' is not primarily con-
cerned with the portrayal and dramatisa-
tion of character—the creation of mem-
orable individuals—as are the works of
the masters of prose fiction from
Petronius to Fielding, Balzac and Dickens.
It is not exactly enjoyable; but it is in-
teresting. It is best regarded as a his-
torical essay in fictional form; and as
such, with a few misgivings noted, it is of
outstanding quality.
Chifley on Censorship.
[Questions on censorship were asked by Mr. Leslie Haylen in the House of Representatives
and Mr. Chifley gave a reply in favor of reform. Following is the “Hansard” report of
question and answer.]
Mr. Chifdey: / read in the press an
announcement that a performance of the
play referred to, which was, l think,
produced by Miss Doris Fitton, had been
visited by the Chief Secretary
Mr. Harrison : No, the Chief Secre-
tary did not visit a performance of the
play.
Mr. Chifley: I understand that the
Chief Secretary intimated that he in-
tended to do so. Anyhow, it is apparent
that he is displeased with the play. 1
agree ' with the view expressed by the
Honorable Member that a uniform stand-
ard of censorship should be adopted
throughout the Commonwealth, and that
some competent body of individuals
should be appointed to establish proper
standards by which literary and artistic
work should be judged. I believe that
the Acting Leader of the Opposition him-
self was at one time involved in some
trouble about the banning of a book ——
Mr. Harrison : No trouble. My action
was quite justified.
Mr. Chifley: At all events, the
Honorable Gentleman incurred some
criticism. I find myself in a rather
peculiar situation in this matter because,
while l was absent from Australia not
very long ago, I recommended to some
of my friends a book which I had just
read. Later it appeared that the book had
been banned. I was absent from Aus-
tralia at the time, and I am afraid that my
view on literary morality cannot be very
high. I agree with the Honorable Mem-
ber that the matter should receive con-
sideration, and l shall mention it at the
next conference of Commonwealth and
State Ministers.
Mr. Haylen: Has the Prime Minister
noticed a report in a Sydney newspaper
that an Australian play written by an
Australian soldier entitled “Rusty Bugles ”
has been banned by police action ? Does
ke recollect that an Australian novel
written in Melbourne, by one Robert
Close, was also banned some time ago ?
Whilst l realise that the authorities con-
cerned are State Governments, will the
Right Honorable Gentleman consider
proposing at the next conference of Com-
monwealth and State Ministers, for the
sake of Australian literature, that some
tribunal should be established before
which writers and playwrights can state
their case in open court? At present
their work is subjected to a censorship
which they regard as characteristic of a
“police State.” The police simply ban a
play, and it is “gone.”
Japan's Future.
On the heels of two new books (re-
viewed R.P. 4/8/’4B) covering Australian
observers’ studies of the outlook in South-
East Asia and Japan comes a Chatham
House survey, New Paths for Japan
(Royal Institute of International Affairs),
in which Mr. Harold Wakefield has re-
vised and amplified the Institute’s previ-
ous Japan in Defeat, published in 1945.
To the basic study of Japanese history,
character and institutions then prepared
as a forecast of probable reactions of
the people under the Allied occupation,
there has now been added an account of
the policies pursued under General Mac-
Arthur’s administration. The author and
his collaborators can answer no better
than any other students of the situation
the questions asked of the future.
What is brought out is that the Japan-
ese population includes many romantic
and spirited men and women, that she is
in numbers the fifth nation on earth,
and that “it will test the wisdom of the
Allies to the utmost to adapt the power-
ful force of age-old national military
sentiments to benevolent international
ends.” Under peaceful conditions the
population is likely to become stationary
at between 85 and 95 millions, sometime
about 1985.
The provision of the nation’s food and
raw materials for industry must be the
supreme concern of any Japanese Gov-
ernment, especially with its people
hemmed in within the home islands, of
whose area (in the aggregate equal to
about half that of New South Wales)
only one-sixth is arable. Today the
population density per acre of arable
land is more than twice that of China.

With high prices, with shortages
that can be overcome if you’re
prepared to pay enough, and with plenty of
opportunities for extravagance, it’s easy enough, these
days, to run through your income and fritter away your
savings. Then "bang” go your chances of security in the
future.
BUT
earn better than bank interest
Other than the necessities of life, the
only wise purchases to-day are Bonds
and Savings Certificates. They keep
your money safe for good use in the
future. They provide the necessary cash
to back your plans and dreams. And,
while you wait, your funds increase at
better than bank rates of interest.
Make a subscription to the next
Commonwealth Loan now, and buy
Savings Certificates regularly out of
income.
Remember, money saved is
money earned.
Save for Security
BUY BONDS & SAVINGS CERTIFICATES
5 Ways to increase your Savings
and Secure your Future
1. Buy only what you really need.
Spend wisely —get full value. Save
all you can.
2. Pay no more than the fixed or
regular prices.
3. Don’t waste money on black-
market goods.
4. Pay your way. Settle your debts.
Buy for cash.
5. Invest your savings, at better
Ithan bank interest, in Common-
wealth Bonds, Savings Certificates

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
Joe Rules That Roost.
When in due course the Soviet
U.N.O. delegate came down on
the Berlin dispute with the veto
—Russia’s 28th resort to it—-
“S. M. Herald” rubbed amazed
eyes and commented :
A curious feature of the discussions
has been the unusual indecision appar-
ently displayed by the Soviet Gov-
ernment, which, to the very end,
seemed in two minds about the reso-
lution. Considered in conjunction
with the blatant flouting of Mr.
Stalin’s earlier decisions by Marshal
Sokolovsky, whose attitude was en-
dorsed from Moscow, this may well
indicate a deep policy split in the
Politburo.
No doubt such inferences
might be drawn from cable ac-
counts ; but Soviet actions all
through have been consistent
enough —to enforce delays
whenever opportunity offered.
Regarding Berlin, the delay-
object has been based on
Moscow’s hopeful expectation
that winter and the blockade
combined will drive the Western
Powers out, without resort to
force. That is an immediate,
objective. The long-range delay-
policy has been based on the
Kremlin conviction that a
Western “capitalist” economic
crisis—thought by Moscow in-
evitable, anyway—can thus be
ensured and hastened.
The further notion that Stalin
is incapable of double-dealing
must surely at this date rank as
incredibly naive or fatuous.
And only on such a notion could
anyone accept the preposterous
suggestion that any Russian Red
Army marshal would “blatantly
flout” Stalin, or, on that sort of
evidence, see signs of discord in
the Politburo.
The always well-informed
“U.S. News and World Report”
dealt with this particular subject
in an issue in the latest air-mail:
“A Russian general in Berlin
appears on the surface of things
to have overruled Stalin in deal-
ing with the U.S., Great Britain
and France on issues related to
Berlin. Yet, among those who
are studying Russia, there is no
support for the theory that the
Army is ruling Stalin. Instead,
the answers to questions that
now are being raised—on the
basis of the most authoritative
information available to the
Governments of the West —are
those that follow.
“Unchallenged boss of Russia
is Stalin. He listens to members
of the Politburo and accepts their
advice, but his decision, once
made, is final.
“The Army in Russia is run
by Stalin and the Politburo ; it
does not run Stalin or the Polit-
buro. Marshal Sokolovsky,
Soviet Military Governor in
Germany, was acting under
orders in Berlin, not acting on
his own, when he backed away
from an apparent agreement
reached by Western envoys with
Premier Stalin in Moscow.
“Dissension is not now divid-
ing the ruling group in Russia.
There is argument over policy
among that group, but a de-
cision, once taken, stands.
“A crack-up in Russia, in the
event of Stalin’s death or serious
illness, is possible, but not prob-
able. Stalin himself has picked
the ruling group beneath him.
This group is accustomed to
working together. No single
member is permitted to have the
means with which to strike for
individual power through a
Putsch.
“So far as the Governments of
the West can see, there is no
present basis for the conclusion
that Russia may be weakened by
trouble among the ruling group.
Other groups in the country who
might cause trouble are ruth-
lessly eliminated.
“The Stalin position, as a re-
sult, is that of a real boss. He
is Communist dictator of a
country of 200,000,000 people,
top man in a party of 6,000,000
members who run the country.
Publicly,- there is no opposition
to Stalin’s will, no appeal from
his decisions. His dictatorship
appears more complete than
those of Adolf Hitler and Benito
Mussolini at the height of their
power in Nazi Germany and
Fascist Italy.
“But the Russian dictator is
the product, not the creator, of
a party machine. At the top of
the party machine are 13 strong
men led by Stalin. He is a
shrewd political boss who is
likely to remain Russia’s dictator
a? long as he can control these
men. There are no signs now
that he is losing his grip.”
Disarmament Dodge.
Handy yardstick for measur-
ing the worth of the Soviet dis-
armament “offers” in U.N.0.:
“From time immemorial the
idea of disarmament has been
one of the most favored forms
of diplomatic dissimulation of
the true motives and plans of
those Governments which have
been seized by such a suddeD
‘love of peace.’
“This phenomenon is very
understandable. Any proposal
for the reduction of armaments
could invariably count upon
broad popularity and support
from public opinion, but, of
course, he who proposed such a
measure always had to foresee
that his intentions would be
divined by the partners in this
diplomatic game.”
Those two paragraphs are
from Vol. 11l of a (.publication
called Diplomatic History,
printed in Moscow in 1945 and
now used in Soviet schools and
universities as a textbook.
Against Atomic War.
War invariably makes hash of
all advance speculations about
it based on moral grounds, but
the following considerations of
atom-war disadvantages, ad-
vanced in a Washington “Post”
article, have a strong practical
basis:
“Whether all - out atomic
attack could technically win a
war within a matter of 30 to
90 days, as some strategists seem
to believe, is not the point. The
more restrained leaders of all
three fighting arms apparently
do not subscribe to such a
theory, and some hold that
another war would become a
total struggle of peoples and re-
sources that might last as long
as 30 years. But assuming that
American planes could breach
enemy defences and could deci-
mate .enemy cities with atomic
bombs, the questions remain
whether such use of the bomb
would be wise and whether in
reliance on atomic weapons we
might not be caught in a booby-
trap of our own making.
“The atomic bomb is primarily
a weapon against cities. We
have been told of technological
improvements that will make the
bombs of the future far more
terrifying than those used on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But
these advances limit rather than
expand the applicability of the
bomb. Presumably the rate of
production is not great. It
would be extravagant, even
from a military standpoint, to
use the bomb against any but the
most important and extensive
enemy military installations. It
is not a weapon that could be
used with effectiveness against a
dispersed army or against indi-
vidual ships. If the Russian
strategy ii| a war were to over-
run Western Europe it is incon-
ceivable that we would use the
atomic bomb in occupied terri-
tory where it would destroy
friends as well as enemies. The
practical utility of the bomb
would in any event be confined
to large concentrations of popu-
lation in the enemy homeland.
“To be sure, some military
men hold to the theory that the
way to end a war quickly is to
destroy a large proportion of the
enemy population. Could we,
the principal upholders of free-
dom and the dignity of man in
the world today, conscientiously
embark on a policy that would
give the lie to everything we
stand for? During the last war
we repeatedly stated that our
objective was not to destroy the
enemy people but merely to halt
the conflict and bring the re-
sponsible military leaders to
book. Our moral stature was in
large part derived from this en-
lightened view. Have we now
abandoned it?
“If we have, then we might
well consider what Hitler
learned in Russia. In the
Ukraine he was met as a libera-
tor until he turned potential
friendship into fanatical resist-
ance by razing conquered cities.
It has been pointed out with
considerable evidence that the in-
discriminate bombing of Ger-
man cities by the British was a
factor in rallying the German
people to fight to the last ditch.
In our Voice of America broad-
casts and similar endeavors, we
have been going on the theory
that many of the people behind
the iron curtain, if given a free
choice, would not support their
leaders. But atomic war would
allow no such distinction be-
tween the guilty and the inno-
cent. We could hope for no
assistance from the people them-
selves if we methodically made
a shambles of their cities.
“There is another practical
consideration. Even though we
might successfully conclude the
military stage of a war by
atomic attack, the military stage,
as we have found in Germany
and Japan, is not all there is to
war. If we expected the con-
quered population to live in
peace and eventually to take a
part in world society, then we
should have to provide for re-
construction. The rehabilitation
of Germany’s economy, which
is now proving so difficult,
would be a minor task com-
pared to the reconstruction that
would have to follow the whole-
sale paralysis of an enemy
country by atomic attack.”
Germans Turn West.
A valuable service credited to
the Berlin air-lift is its swinging
of the great bulk of Germans
definitely to the Western side ;
in this completing what Soviet
occupation - blundering had
started.
On that blundering the Lon-
don “Times” Berlin correspon-
dent characterises “the Russian
failure to consolidate their con-
quest” over the Germans as “one
of the salient facts of con-
temporary history.” This has
been “the more surprising be-
cause the goodwill and friendli-
ness with which the first Rus-
sian troops, disciplined and well
intentioned, were welcomed by
many citizens was as manifest as
it was sincere. They were re-
ceived as real liberators. Since
those days the fall in their stock
has been precipitous.”
The success to date of the air-
lift —“the most spectacular set-
back which Russian tactics have
so far suffered” —has further de-
creased the already-low Russian
standing in German eyes. The
most striking evidence of this
given to the Kremlin was when
the Russians offered to feed the
whole of Berlin and only 1 per
cent, of the people in the Wes-
tern sectors of the city registered
for the promised rations.
Another striking bit of evi-
dence of the same feeling
cropped up at the time of the
Reichstag demonstrations early
in September, when “thousands
came from the Eastern sector to
join the people of Western Ber-
lin in a common protest.” That
was a severe blow to the Rus-
sians, not so much in the “loss
of face” involved, as in the fact
that they evidently had come to
believe in their own propaganda,
which had represented the Ger-
mans of their own sector as com-
pletely Sovietised.
The Russian failure in Berlin
is ascribed by the “Times” man
to several causes; chiefly that,
though Berlin is Socialistically
inclined, it is not Communist:
“After a surfeit of Hitlerism, its
citizens have no taste for a
second experiment in totali-
tarianism. Within the compass
of their own city they have
watched the Western way and
the Eastern; and in spite of the
occasional failure of the British
and American and French
authorities to grasp the German
point of view, the Western way
has prevailed. Fear of the knock
at the door in the night has re-
turned.”
The Russians, in short, have
proved no better as conquerors
than the Germans themselves.
Planless U.S.A.
Noting the puzzlement of Sir
Henry Tizard, chief scientific
adviser to the British Govern-
ment, over the disparity between
U.S. and British production
records (far higher in the U.S.),
“Wall-street Journal” offers an
explanation;
“They [the puzzled plan-
addicts] note regretfully that we
[Americans] don’t plan our steel
production, and so they can’t
understand how we make so
much of it. Nobody plans our
housing or health needs or sets
quotas for shoes or refrigerators,
yet for all our shortcomings, in
some miraculous way people
here have better houses, more
doctors and hospitals, more
shoes and refrigerators than
other peoples. Even our indus-
trial training and research are
haphazard. That such aimless-
ness produces such marvellous
results seems to the theorists an
illogical miracle.
“The secret —illogical and ab-
surd though it appears to those
bewildered —is in our planless-
ness. Or, to be more accurate,
in our freedom to have many
plans uncurbed by a master-
plan handed down immutable
frofti above.
“If people want shoes some-
body goes and makes them. The
shoemaker doesn’t have to get
permission; he doesn’t have to
stick to any quota or make a
particular type somebody thinks
people ought to have. He just
makes shoes, and the pressure is
on him to make a better and
less-costly shoe. If he satisfies
the people— not a Government
planner—the rewards are great.
If he fails some more ingenious
shoemaker will usurp his place.
“In our aimlessness we have
no Government blueprint for
shoe production. But it is
planned and controlled nonethe-
less, and by a most sensitive,
flexible and powerful plan. The
master-plan here is the sum
total of all the individual plans
on how much of their substance
people are willing to exchange
for shoes. And woe to the shoe-
maker who transgresses this
plan.
“We have no organised plan
for technological research and
training, either. But we have
nearly 10,000,000 separate pri-
vate enterprises. Any one of
these can hatch a new idea for
improving a product or the way
it is made. Most of them try
hard, for very selfish reasons ;
many succeed. That is the
secret of the high ‘average’
technological skill Sir Henry
envies. No master - minded
economy can hope for so many
wellsprings of initiative and
ingenuity.
“In Sir Henry’s country
miners dig coal by Government
blueprint. The steelmakers,
while subject to many planned
controls, are still relatively free.
In this country [U.S.] both the
steelmakers and coalminers just
make steel and dig coal with-
out any Government plans. The
production record in all these
cases increases directly with in-
creased freedom from the coils
of the ‘planners.’
“You need not stop with a
few industries. Nor even with
America. In all the countries in
the world the standard of living
and the well-being of the people
are highest where there are the
fewest fetters.”
Dragnet Digest.
Withheld Atom Secrets.- —.Like
those publicised examples Russia and
Australia, France also is refused U.S.
atom-bomb secrets. As the Paris
correspondent of N.Y. “Herald
Tribune” reports it, the reason there,
too, is distrust of Communists:
“Although this reason for the refusal
exists nowhere on paper, physicists
in Europe are certain that France has
been put in this unhappy position
almost entirely because Frederic
Joliot-Curie, a leading world physi-
cist and one of the men around
whom science in France centres, is
an avowed Communist.”
* * * *
No-war Policy. —Touching on
present overall Western policy, lead-
ing “Saturday Evening Post” corre-
spondent Demaree Bess sums up:
“The actual situation today is that
the policy of the United States Gov-
ernment, like the policies of Britain
and France, is based upon the as-
sumption that another world war is
not inevitable; that a \yorking agree-
ment with Russia can be reached as
soon as the Western Governments
prove their political determination
and obtain the military means to up-
hold their present position.”
* * * *
Nationalising Mirage. —Glimpsed in
the British desert by a “Wall-street
Journal” correspondent: “Whatever
may be said in explanation of the
poor showing of Britain’s coalmines,
one fact is indisputable. Nationalisa-
tion has been no panacea. The miners
feel no more enthusiasm for a remote,
bureaucratic Coal Board than they felt
for the former private owners. The
idea, beloved of Socialist theorists,
that the workers would pitch in with
disinterested zeal and work harder
voluntarily when industries belonged
to the State, not to private indivi-
duals, has proved a complete mirage.”
* * * *
J. Bull Going Strong. —Diagnosis
by N. Y, “Herald Tribune”: “Politi-
cal observers who wrote funeral ora-
tions for the British Commonwealth
a year or two ago apparently were
wasting their time. Although the
patient still has a few sore muscles
here and there he seems to be growing
healthier every day. The conference
of Commonwealth Prime Ministers
has produced indications that the
Commonwealth still has real vitality
and that the present state of the world
adds to its reasons for existence.”
The map of the old Empire has been
changed, “but the Commonwealth,
which is the modern and democratic
form of the Empire, still is not only
alive but vigorous.”
* * *
Tardy European Union. —Joining in
the chorus of U.S. .blaming of Britain,
and to a lesser extent France, for
slow progress of a “United States of
Europe,” N. Y. “Daily News” points
out that Americans, liking to see re-
sults, “do not admire or approve
people who just sit around and utter
pious wishes plus laments that the
wishes can’t come true.” Hence, it’s
“a fairly safe guess that, if the U.S.E.
isn’t a good deal farther along toward
reality when the 81st Congress is in
session next year, then said Congress
will be more than grumpy about
keeping the Marshall Plan rolling at
its present rate, if at all. We think
Britain and France would be smart
to act on this high probability, and act
fast. If they don’t, the gentle rain of
Marshall billions may slack off seri-
ously, if it doesn’t stoo' altogether.”
$ s * *
Radioactive Ships. —Of the 76 ships
used in the 1946 Bikini atom-bomb
tests, three still afloat are even now
(states N. Y. “Herald Tribune”) “dan-
gerously hot” with radioactivity. Two
of the three are to be sunk because it
would cost more to decontaminate
them than could, be realised by their
sale as scrap. The U.S. Navy “has
explored a number of decontamina-
tion methods, about which little has
been made public. It is significant,
however, that ships which were located
anywhere near the eye of the target
finally were scuttled. Apparently they
could not be cleansed.”
* * * *
The Bulldog Touch. —British and
Americans as fighting soldiers, summed
up by German General Blumentritt
in Capt. Liddell Hart’s just-published
The German Generals Talk, quoted
by N. Y. “Daily News”: “The
Americans attacked with zest, and
had a keen sense of mobile action,
but when they came under heavy artil-
lery fire they usually fell back —even
after they had made a successful
penetration. By contrast, once the
British had got their teeth in, and
had been in a position for 24 hours,
it proved almost impossible to shift
them. To counter-attack the British
always cost us very heavy losses. I
had many opportunities to observe
this interesting difference in the
autumn of 1944, when the right half
of my corps faced the British and the
left half the American.”
•f*
Soviet Slaves. —British Under-Secre-
tary for Foreign Affairs Christopher
Mayhew describes for U.N.O. the
sweetness and light in the Back to
Barbarity movement in Russia, with
the slaves totalling some 15,000,000:
“It can no longer be denied that the
Soviet Union is making use of large
numbers of prisoners as forced labor
in conditions denying to them the
basic human rights; that these human
beings, once deprived of their liberty,
are maintained in conditions of
wretchedness and undernourishment;
that, under the cloak of arrests for
crimes and other offences against the
regime, the Soviet Government has
acquired for itself a vast body of
cheap labor utterly without rights;
that, in short, the Soviet Union has
instituted a slave system recruited
from among its own citizens which in
scope has no parallel in history.”

FIFTH-COLUMN ACTION.
On the breakdown last week of negotia-
tions to avoid a general coal strike —
when the miners’ leaders went away to
tell their mass-meetings to vote for the
Communist-planned industrial war —the
Prime Minister found no resources for
counter-action. He might have at once
warned these bushrangers of the coal-
fields that the Government would not
remain passive if the strike threat was
carried out. Instead, Mr. Chifley be-
moaned a “tragic blow to the country,”
hoped “sanity would prevail,- v and
“asked the Federation to desist.”
Even that wooden figure “Labor’s”
Deputy-Premier in N.S.W., whose job as
acting-leader is to play safe by doing
nothing, described the miners’ action as
a personal affront. Mr. Baddeley has
never said a truer thing. It was an affront
to both the Governments concerned, and
was pieant to be. One of them recognised
it.
The showdown was here at long last.
A general strike would play old Harry
with all the Socialist “Golden-Age” plan-
ning, with the boasted benefits of “full
employment,” and with a “Labor” party
whose fa9ade of “solidarity” has no more
stability than a house of cards in a
hurricane.
The strike had no basis in any miners’
grievance, or in any interest at all of the
miners’ rank-and-file. All honest miners
—and that means the majority of them —
detested this sabotage of Australian in-
dustry. The great bulk of the men in
the northern and western fields had not
taken seriously the possibility of a
general stoppage and abstained from what
their Communist leaders call “voting.”
The pre-strike conferences, drawing as
they did the full weight of the industrial
and political wings of “the movement,”
had found a formula for settlement
which, whatever its faults, appeared at
least to offer means of saving face for
the two powerful unions at last at grips
with each other over the cutting of the
Kemeira rock-tunnel.
Actually, the Kemeira tunnel was about
as much the cause of this trouble as was
Jenkins’s ear the cause of the English war
against Spain in Walpole’s day'. The
tunnel counted for nothing with the
strike’s organisers. These are the
members of the Communist “general
staff” who have vowed vengeance
against the A.W.U. for the defeat the
Communists suffered in the nine-weeks
general strike in Queensland early this
year, and against that section of the
“Labor” party which has been develop-
ing the “industrial, groups” within the
unions generally for elimination of Com-
munist influences. The notorious
general-secretary of the Ironworkers’
executive revealed recently in the “Com-
munist Review” all that it is necessary
for any “Government” worthy of the
name to know. He wrote:
The policy of the Ironworkers’ Union is
decided in consultation with the leaders
of the Communist party The same thing
ia many ways applies to the Waterside
Workers’ Federation, the Miners’ Federa-
tion, the Seamen’s Union, and soon will
apply to many other unions, such as the
A.E.U. (Amalgamated Engineers) and the
A.R.U. (Railways).
Indeed, the Ironworkers’ executive is
concurrently waging against the A.W.U.
members in the metal-working shops at
Port Kembla exactly the same “terror
campaign’.’ (as the N.S.W. Industrial
Commission heard last week) as the
miners at Kemeira.
Marx House has decided that, in aid
of Russia’s “cold war” against the demo-
cracies, coal shall be refused to Aus-
tralian industry as to French, German
and British industries. Accordingly, the
miners’ executive has put an intolerable
darg on coal output, subjected the in-
dustry to constant petty stoppages and
threats of a general strike, and demands
a ban on opencut coal-workings. Since,
so far, it has not been able to close these
down, other servants of Marx House,
acting through a waterfront union—the
ships’ painters and dockers’ union most
conveniently discovered another inter-
union dispute—have prevented the un-
loading in Sydney of machinery for
opencut workings consigned to the Joint
Coal Board. It was stated that the ship
would have to leave for foreign ports
with the consignment undischarged.
How the Marx House Soviet behaved
when, early in the piece, a settlement of
the South Coast dispute had been
arranged between the parties was shown
by the barefaced repudiation of the com-
promise by the miners’ council. The
fact that Mr. Clarey—with whom not
many weeks ago the miners’ Communist
boss had fixed up an A.C.T.U. publicity
campaign to whitewash the miners’ in-
surgence—was active in trying to settle
the Kemeira dispute weighed not in the
least with Commissar Williams. The
latter turned and rent the would-be
peacemaker:
We very emphatically told the A.C.T.U.
officials that the way to settle the dispute
was not to try to create [sic] a demarca-
tion dispute between the Miners’ Federa-
tion and the A.W.U. The job of the
A.C.T.U. is to mobilise the support of the
whole trade-union movement against the
Australian Iron and Steel Co.
Arbitrate with these “mimicking
Molotovs”! Impossible, and Mr.
Chifley knows it. He and Senator
“Fixer” Ashley have hamstrung the Coal
Tribunal as arbitrator for 12 months
past. There can be no arbitration under
a “Government” which aims solely at
peace at any price with industrial
ruffians.
Nor does it matter how “tempera-
mentally fitted” the new streamlined
arbitrators of the Socialist regime may
be. The N.S.W. “Labor” Ministry’s own
late member, Mr. Ham. Knight, is hav-
ing his life as Conciliation Commissioner
made miserable by another Communist
union boss whose tactics Marx House
(as Commissar Thornton says) dictates.
After an exhibition of insolence during
a shipping case the other day, the Sea-
men’s boss Elliott finished by telling poor
Mr. Knight—“ Nobody makes me do
anything. The only ones who make any-
body do anything are the unions.”
A couple -of months ago Mr. Chifley
and “Fixer” Ashley went to the northern
fields to speak to the miners directly, and
the “Fixer” told one meeting that their
union’s defiance of the Coal Board
“could mean the end of ‘Labor’ Govern-
ments” in Canberra and Sydney. When
the row between the A.W.U. and the
Communist unions tears the “Labor”
party to pieces Mr. Chifley can blame
himself most of all. His toleration of
these “philosophers,” as he called them,
has been the signal to them to defy all
authority.
Nobody could accuse the Federal
member for Hunter, Mr. Rowley James,
of being uninstructed in miners’ politics,
and Mr. Chifley made him his liaison
officer with the miners’ council. But
Mr. Chifley would not take warning even
from him. Seven months ago, shortly
before his serious motor accident, Mr.
James said bluntly, at the time of the
threatened miners’ strike in aid of the
Communist plot against Queensland:
A nation-wide coal strike... .would deal
a shattering blow to the trade-unions and
the “Labor” movement. As a “Labor”
man and a trade-unionist 1 resent the
intrusion into the trouble of anti-
“ Labor” industrial forces which accept
policy from Russia, whose concern it is
to cause trouble and retard the progress
of other nations towards economic re-
covery.
For what cause other than that the
A.W.U. is espousing now —the freedom
of the decent unionist to follow his occu-
pation under protection of the law—did
a section of “Labor’s” political wing,
with the blessing of Mr. Chifley himself,
organise industrial groups within the
unions to oust Communist influence?
Did Mr. Chifley, when insisting that com-
bating Communism was a job not for
the Government but for the unions them-
selves, mean to imply that he was con-
tent to start a dogfight and let the best
dog win? With all the doubts about
Mr. Chifley’s disposition towards the
Communists, it is hardly possible to be-
lieve him capable of such cynicism. Yet
what support have the crusaders got
from him?
Last March the Victorian A.L.P.’s
annual conference carried a resolution
declaring that Communists, “directed by
the Russian Communist party, were com-
mitted to the destruction of the A.L.P.
as a prelude to social disorder and the
seizure of political power by revolution.”
It defeated a motion calling for the
abolition of the industrial groups, and
demanded “more active participation” in
the fight by “Labor” Parliamentarians.
Amid uproar, the Communists left the
conference threatening to disaffiliate their
unions from the A.L.P.
In June the N.S.W. annual A.L.P. con-
ference took the full brunt of the Com-
munist-bossed unions’ resentment, de-
feated the wreckers again, and recom-
mended general support for the industrial
groups and exposure by the A.L.P.
executive of Communist operations. The
ball was thrown expressly to the inter-
state triennial A.L.P. conference, at
which Mr. Chifley was due to pull the
strings. That conference met three
months later ; Mr. Chifley did pull the
strings, and the Federal conference, to
its disgrace, shied off the Communist
business.
Was anything else to be expected from
the head of a Government who regards
these outlaws as “philosophers” ; whose
Attorney-General (when, as rarely, he
appears in Parliament) rebuffs every
query here at home about the aims of a
gang of traitors whose masters he iden-
tifies clearly , enough abroad as destroyers
of world-peace; whose Minister for
Labor and National Service thinks Com-
munism Christlike; whose Postmaster-
General says of these strikes that there
are not enough of them ; whose Minister
for Defence can only with the greatest
exertions be prised away from a con-
viction that Communist spies on the pay-
roll in Government departments do not
matter; whose Minister for Transport
loses no opportunity of lauding Soviet
Russia as the examplar of democratic
enlightenment?
Why should such “Labor” leaders as
these be “disappointed,” as Mr. Chifley
says, at the failure of their “appeals” to
the wolves who are ravaging Australian
industry? *
If it is left to the A.W.U. to carry on
the fight which the .Chifleyites have
shirked, good luck to it! It will not be able
to save the anaemic, decrepit thing which
was once the Australian Labor party
from the wrath of the electors. But it
can do the next-best thing, which is to
clean “Labor” up, inside and out, so that
in course of time it may regain its self-
respect.
Mr. Truman's Triumph.
If ever a man earned the right to stand
up in the public view and pat himself
on the back, U.S. President Harry S.
Truman has done so; For few would
question that the most outstanding feature
of his election, the chief ingredient of his
success, was his own individual effort.
His surprise win was, above' all, a per-
sonal triumph. The other factors in it
were secondary. He won by sheer force
of his own personal determination, con-
viction and courage—when everybody but
himself rated his chance hopeless. Hence,
for these times of levelling down, a
significant reaffirming of individual
worth, the more so because of the appa-
rently insuperable odds against him.
There has never been a more wholesale
puncturing and deflating of political
prophets. If nothing else is cheap in the
United States —and nothing else is—
crystal-balls ought to be a dime a gross,
including those of the flatteringly desig-
nated public-opinion polls. On one of
the leading practitioners of this dubious
“science,” who had predicted his defeat,
Mr. Truman, campaigning hard, com-
mented: “You can throw the Gallup
Poll right in the ash-can.” He had reason
to be terse —if the prophetic accuracy of
this “science” may be questionable, its
propaganda influence might well be con-
siderable. But at least the Gallup ex-
ponents should have company in the
bin. Mr. Roper, who runs a rival
outfit, announced a couple of months
before election-day that his concern would
be taking no more polls on this Presi-
dential event, any more being mere waste
of time, since those already taken so con-
sistently and conclusively pointed to Mr.
Dewey as the certain winner.
Not only these poll, people suffered
puncture as prophets. A canvas of some
90 of the country’s leading political cor-
respondents, strategically situated in their
close observation-posts in Washington,
brought a unanimous forecast of a Tru-
man defeat, the pnly time these gentlemen
had ever been unanimous about anything.
All round, the rush of scribes to get
themselves, in their own vernacular, out
on a limb was so headlong that it is no
great wonder the bough broke and let
down the lot of them. A typical speci-
men of the Lays of the Limb of these
Bards of the Bough has the tune of the
entire choir; “A fortnight hence, New
York’s Gov. Thomas E. Dewey will be-
come President-elect of the United States
of America.” The fortnight has passed.
So, for all relevant purposes, has New
York’s Gov.
Along with the propaganda-injury the
“science” and the scribes would be caus-
ing him, Mr. Truman was target for a
pelting of assorted downright abuse and
defamation comparable in quantity and
quality to the enshelled livestock and
overripe tomatoes enthusiastically hurled
at his pathetic minor rival Mr. Wallace,
apostle of the dud god Joe. Ironically
enough, the fashion for this personal
abuse of the President—a position usually
regarded by Americans as sacrosanct
until vacated —had been set earlier by a
Soviet scribe, whose grossly belittling
article was widely reprinted in America’s
unfettered press. Few Presidents in their
lifetime, even in the general open season
of election-year, have ever been abused
with the gusto displayed in the American
improvements on that singular example.
It was not so much the nature of the be-
littling as the extent of it.
Thus, Mr. Harold Ickes, one-time some-
thing of a noise in the land, jocularly an-
nounced that he had “come out for JHarry
S. Truman as the ‘least worse’ of the
candidates for President.” N. Y. “Daily
News” capped this with: “When it comes
to picking our worst President ever, we’d
match James Buchanan against Harry S.
Truman any day.” United Mine
Workers’ president John L. Lewis—
heavily-fined second-best when a nation-
wrecking strike he fostered was countered
by Mr. Truman with a display of the
quality of guts so conspicuously lacking
in our own Mr. Chifley—naturally joined
in the blackguarding. “Truman,’’ he
said, “is totally unfitted for office. His
principles are elastic. He is careless with
the truth. He is a malignant, scheming
sort of individual who is dangerous not
only to the United Mine Workers but
dangerous to the United States of
America.”
Mr. Truman surveyed all this turgid
wash and set out on his campaigning,
with the characteristically personal de-
claration “If I felt better I couldn’t stand
it.” In that fighting spirit he conducted
one of the most active campaigns ever
undertaken by a President. He had
against him an apparently unbeatable
team, the Governor of New York and
the Governor of California. His own
Democratic party was split into three
factions, by the Wallace defection and
by the traditionally “solid” South’s revolt
against the President’s civil-rights pro-
posals, interpreted as overfavoring
negroes. Because of this seeming disin-
tegration Mr. Truman had not been ex-
pected to get even the party nomination
as its Presidential candidate. Ghosts
were dragged up from his past to plague
him. He had been only a compromise
Vice-President in the first place, let in
through the gap of convention disagree-
ment over two more-favored candidates;
and he was President only by the
accident of death.
Yet Mr. Truman not only won
to the Presidency but carried his amaz-
ingly revived, and probably astounded,
party with him, to control both branches
of Congress, the House and the Senate.
Certainly there were substantial enough
factors which at least should have
assisted in that personal triumph. The
strongest of these was organised labor,
the sour Mr. Lewis and his miners not-,
withstanding. The Truman trump-card
in this was his having vetoed the Taft-
Hartley labor-controL bill, even though,
it having been made law despite him,
the President did resort to it him-
self when it became a national interest
to halt the Lewis-fostered coal strike.
Other factors Mr. Truman might well
have counted on in favor of his Adminis-
tration and against desire for change
included a national income higher than it
had ever been ; more working steadily
at permanent jobs than ever before in
American history; wages, too, higher
than ever; farmers making more than
they had ever done; and business in
general booming. A measure of assist-
ance would certainly also come from the
entrenched bureaucracy of more than
2,500,000 office-holders and all their
friends and relations, particularly in
view of Mr. Dewey’s ecstatically opti-
mistic campaign announcement that “on
January 20 [his confidently expected
inauguration date] there would begin in
Washington the biggest unravelling, un-
snarling, untangling [i.e., sacking] opera-
tion in our nation’s history.”
Yet another combination of factors
might reasonably have been counted on
by one with Mr. Truman’s evident faith
in human gratitude. As one of the very
few to toss a bouquet his way noted,
“No peace-time President in the history
of the United States ever had to face as
big an accumulation of domestic and
imported woe as confronted H|riy
Truman in the last 12 months.” The
same assessor added what is really the
complete compliment to the Truman
qualities of personal courage and indi-
vidualism : “The troubles of Truman the
President were complicated by the diffi-
culties of Truman the Candidate. When-
ever he did what he believed fo be right
for him to do as President, he alrffost
invariably discovered that he had done
wrong as Candidate.”
It would be useless to seek for any
counterpart of that at Canberra; for the
Truman choice, at least in the main, has
been that which he believed right *s
President—that is, a placing of the
national interest before self or party. In
that he showed in office the styne
qualities that he displayed in his sup-
posedly forlorn fight for endorsement as
President. T.he outcome most unmistak-
ably demonstrated that appreciation of
such qualities of individual worth has
not vanished from the earth.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Evattism Abroad.
“Curiouser and curiouser,” as Alice
said, becomes the Federal Government’s
procedure in the Bank Grab Act appeal-
case before the Privy Council. Is Dr.
Evatt’s heart really in this business, or
has he not had the time?
As Attorney-General on behalf of a
Ministry and a party which would
abolish all appeals whatever to the Privy
Council, desiring that the jurisdiction of
the High Court shall be supreme, he is
actually ignoring a provision in the
Federal Constitution (Section 74) which
does impose restrictions on appeals from
the High Court and is asking the Privy
Council to ignore it also.
There is no question of what Section
74 means, or of the compromise it repre-
sents between one party in the Federal
convention which demanded unfettered
right of appeal to the Privy Council on
any issue (which Joseph Chamberlain,
the Colonial Secretary of the day, ap-
proved) and another party there which
insisted that at least “upon any question
arising as to the limits inter se of the
Constitutional powers of the Common-
wealth and those of any State or States”
the right to appeal shall first be certified
by the High Court.
For some reason Dr. Evatt did not
seek leave from the High Court. He has
been dilating to the Privy Council on
what the original compromise meant and
arguing that the requirement of a ticket
from the High Court applied only in “an
essentially domestic dispute.” On which
the president, Lord Wright, commented:
“You can only construe the meaning of
the words as they are in the section.”
On the other point, the High Court’s
majority interpretation of Section 92
(decreeing “absolute” freedom of trade,
commerce and intercourse among the
States), Dr. Evatt ignores the ruling of
the Privy Council in the James case —
which decided, in effect, that the clause
means precisely what it says—and his
involved reasoning on what the High
Court judgments said, mixed up with his
expectations of what effect it might have
on his Government’s future but un-
named plans, seems to leave the appeal
Bench naturally a little cold.
Australians who know their Evatt, and
those particularly who are more than a
little suspicious of the crowd in Can-
berra he represents, are not slow to
assume, from the way Evatt is going
about this Privy Council business, that
what the Government is really seeking is
a general (as distinct from a specific)
interpretation of Section 92 which would
tell them how far they might safely go
in their socialistic schemes, and so allow
them to confront the High Court, upon
any future challenge, with the Privy
Gquncil’s declared view.
Apart from the fact that the Privy
Council is not the sort of bird to be
caught with that chaff, Evatt appears to
be asking for the retort: “If you really
want to get your Constitutional land-
marks placed by us, why don’t you go
through the prescribed process of asking
your High Court’s permission first?”
Well, why didn’t Evatt do just that?
Red Tape and D.Ps.
Last week, for the first time since Aus-
tralia started receiving Displaced Per-
sons as immigrants under the 1.R.0.
agreement, a Lithuanian just arrived was
ordered to be deported (on request from
the responsible authorities in Germany).
Two other recent arrivals, also to be de-
ported, could not be found and are being
■hacked down.
The incident helps to show the strict
J Hature of the screening of D.Ps. by the
international staff, which includes a
number of Australians, in the Allied
of Western Germany. There have
''Apparently been no mistakes so far, and
if the current instance was a mistake it
has quickly been picked up by those
responsible for the “screening.”
By all accounts, which The Bulletin
tats confirmed from a responsible official
temporarily on leave in Australia, the
recruiting of immigrants from this source
is proving to be a thoroughly good job.
Australia is well forward in getting her
choice of ’them, and the types of men
aid women, especially from the Baltic
States, are excellent.
•There is, however, one direction in
which the Immigration Department
ought to take advice from officials on the
spot. That is in the reluctance, to all
concerned inexplicable, to take families
together instead of merely the head of a
family. Many refugee families have been
reassembled, not without much difficulty,
by the 1.R.0. staffs, and it is ridiculous
that Australia, willing to take the fathers,
should separate the families again.
If housing is the difficulty surely the
organisation here is able by now to pro-
vide temporary accommodation, however
rough. After all, many Australian
families still have to put up with it. To
approve and accept the parents as desir-
able stock and refuse the children is not
only foolish —the stock being good—but
inhumane.
Boycotts and Substitutes.
Speaking in Melbourne N.S.W. Prices
Minister Finnan applauded the action of
housewives who had boycotted high-
priced ham and bacon. He suggested an
extension of the idea, saying that a boy-
cott was “the surest and quickest way to
end profiteering 1 strongly recommend
that where the price of an item increases
unduly following decontrol, housewives
should use a substitute.”
That advice, sound enough in theoiy,
presupposes that substitutes are available,
and under the present system of under-
production encouraged by past “Labor”
lassitude, the principle of “don’t work
yourself out of a job” and helped along
by the 40-hour week, in most cases they
just aren’t.
People can do without ham and bacon ;
for a time they may even find, as the
Minister suggests, a substitute for
potatoes, but for household necessaries
in general there is no substitute, and the
only way prices can ultimately be kept
down is by increased output.
But what Mr. Finnan is really saying is
that the laws of supply and demand will
take care of prices, and that is a theme
which has been excised from the “Labor”
song-book. His State House colleague
Mr. O’Sullivan will not thank him if
housewives and their husbands apply the
advice to the high cost of tram travel —
fares have just been bumped up for the
second time in a twelvemonth —and seek
a substitute, though he is probably safe
there, as the only one available is
Shanks’s pony.
But the advice has an even wider appli-
cation which may cause the friends of
Finnan some apprehension. By far the
costliest item for which the Australian
public is called upon to foot the bill is the
high cost of “Labor” government. Per-
haps in that lies the solution to the whole
problem. Next year the people will have
a chance to boycott that and seek a sub-
stitute, in the Federal sphere at any rate.
Mr. Finnan’s own crowd is due for recon-
sideration not long after.
More Trains for Queensland.
Nothing much has been heard lately
from Mr. Ward, the Canberra Minister
for Transport, about his grand plan for
unifying the Australian railway gauges.
It’s possible he has been thinking of other
things; all the same he should be deeply
interested in an announcement by
Queensland Commissioner for Railways
Maloney, who has recommended spend-
ing upwards of £16,000,000 on that
State’s railways in the next seven years.
The Maloney plans suggest that Mr.
Maloney has given the Ward plan away.
For their £16,000,000 Queenslanders
are to get duplication of some lines and
quadruplication of others, several new
high-level bridges, new workshops here
and there, new stations there and here,
rearrangement of various depots and
yards, new engines, carriages and trucks
“of steel as far as possible,” a new air-
conditioned “Sunshine train,” etc.
The Commissioner has “no appre-
hensions” regarding the future of pas-
senger traffic on Queensland railways.
Though considerable passenger traffic
has “been lost to air and road transport,”
the “natural increase in population and
the greater desire of the people to travel
have brought about an increase in rail-
way passenger traffic.”
That seems shaky ground on which to
base future hopes, especially the “in-
crease in population.” Mr. Maloney
should take the 1947 census figures and
do a little comparative figuring with
them, with the increases in road and air
traffic and the general condition of Gov-
ernment railways throughout the con-
tinent.
What Queenslanders should be con-
cerned about is the absence from Mr.
Maloney’s published plans of any refer-
ence to the long-recognised need for a
railway to get stock in and out of the
back country. When it came out in the
Legislative Assembly that it was pro-
posed to electrify Brisbane’s suburban
lines, somebody wanted to know about
the outback and got from Mr. Duggan,
the Transport Minister, the answer that
i: would “greatly benefit country dis-
tricts” because electrification would
“release some 44 steam locomotives for
the conveyance of starving stock.”
How the 44 will run on the stock-
routes —there being no lines to carry
them —is Mr. Duggan’s secret. Still, the
weary outbackers.can always fly down
to Brisbane and have a ride on the “new
air-conditioned Sunshine train,” pro-
vided they’re prepared to part up the tax
on their aeroplane ticket.
Typical Socialising.
The attitude of Britain’s Socialist Gov-
ernment towards nationalising the steel
industry is typical of the breed every-
where —any excuse is good enough for
grabbing an industry the planners have
set their hearts on. t
The excuses need not be consistent with
past performances; the Socialist pigeon-
holes are chockful of “reasons” and
“justifications” to be pulled out, dusted
and served up as required.
When the railways and coalmines were
the target, inefficiency and mismanage-
ment were the pegs on which the death
sentence of private enterprise was hung,
but as the output of steel ingots for the
first half of the current year exceeded the
target set that argument could hardly be
used to justify the steel-grab. But the
planners aren’t embarrassed ; they have
discovered that “steel is basic and public
ownership of the industry is essential to.
planning and to national recovery.” ?
How our own Socialists must A envy
their British colleagues’ freedom from
the limiting influence of a written Con-
stitution! But neither the Westminster
nor the Canberra planners can escape
the ultimate verdict of the people.
CUCKOO!

CARRERAS LIMITED - OVER 150 YEARS REPUTATION FOR QUALITJ
POLITICAL POINTS
After four days of a general coal strike
the miners’ Communist bosses had a good
look at the chances of staging a bigger
and better hold-up than that in Queens-
land last March, and decided that the
going might be too tough. They defeated
the N.S.W. Government’s order of last
Friday that the miners should go back to
work on Monday, and then gave in.
Of course, this is not the end of the
real business, the war of the Communists
against the A.W.U. The Kemeira tunnel
was only the occasion of the attempted
Australia-wide general stoppage —not the
cause of it. The quarrel lies deeper and
is not cured. x
By getting the miners back to work
without settling anything, the Socialist
Governments in Canberra and Sydney
have again postponed the final clash with
the Communists. The miners’ bosses
have demonstrated once more that,
though householders may be threatened
with a £5OO fine for using gas outside
hours allotted under famine restrictions,
there will be no penalties inflicted on
the handful of subversive agents of a
foreign Power who caused the shortage
by their own deliberate acts. Chifley’s
words perturb them not at all, for they
trade on his fear of “splitting the ‘Labor’
party.”
As a result of a month’s stoppage on
the southern coalfield and four days’
general stoppage, shortages will for certain
mfflict all Australian Users for the next
three months.
All political prophets in America had
assumed that Wallace’s third party, while
not having the slightest cHance of getting
anywhere itself, would split the Demo-
cratic vote and help to defeat Truman.
It now seems likely that Wallace’s de-
fection, was a blessing in disguise to the
President. By taking the Commos off
Truman’s back he was probably respon-
sible for swinging to the Democrats
many middle-of-the-roaders who would
have voted Republican if the Comrades
had been backing Truman.
Stassen and Taft must now be con-
gratulating themselves for not winning
the Republican nomination. Stassen
might have bettered Dewey’s figures and
scraped into the White House, but it
would have been a hollow victory as he
would have had to contend with a hostile
Congress; Taft, as one of the authors of
the Taft-Hartley Act, would almost cer-
tainly have been defeated. Stassen, at
41, can still cherish hopes of one day
attaining the Presidency; Dewey, only a
few years older, can pack the ambition
away in rose-leaves for ever. The Re-
publican Convention flew in the face of
tradition in choosing him this year, as
no once-defeated candidate had ever won
the U.S. Presidency. It was probably
only the party’s supreme confidence that
the tide had turned in its favor that led
to the risk being taken ; it won’t be taken
again.
Dame Enid Lyons has developed into
one of the most effective speakers on the
Opposition side at Canberra. Her
speeches are always meaty, her delivery
well above the general standard of the
House, and she handles interjections
capably. To a remark by Calwell
that the only way to check Communism
was to abolish poverty she replied:—
Surely the Minister knows that at this
moment Communism is flourishing in
Australia as never before, and yet this
Government continues to assert that Aus-
tralia has never before been as prosperous
as it is today.
Dedman interjecting that it was not true
that Communists were stronger today
than before, Dame Enid turned on him
with:
If the Minister and the Government be-
lieve that, it may explain the inactivity on
the part of this Government in dealing
with Communism Are any of the Com-
munists with whom we are familiar other
than prosperous? Does any one of them
look poverty-stricken? Does he preach
his gospel in the slums? On the contrary,
he moves amongst the people who have
other reasons for discontent.
Neither Dedman nor any other “Labor”
man found an answer to that, and Duthie,
who followed his fellow-Tasmanian in the
debate, felt it safer to stick to other
subjects.
Lang’s “Century,” in an open letter to
the P.M. on the naming of new elec-
torates in N. S. Wales, asks why the old
Cook seat, renamed Grayndler after an
A.W.U. president, wasn’t christened
Garden. It further suggests that if the
A. is out to honor party benefactors
it should not overlook Harry O’Regan,
who by his brainwave of the Four “A’s”
Senate ticket gave to Australia such
“political giants” as Ashley, Amour and
Armstrong. Says the “Century”:
There was great excitement at the Hall
when Harry announced that he had found
an unknown candidate in Lithgow who
knew all about billiards and had the un-
beatable qualification that his name started
with “A.” Now he is the Leader of the

From the “Labor” point of view the
trouble about Lang, at Canberra and in
his paper, is that he just won’t keep the
past under his hat.
Officials of Red-anted unions, particu-
larly Thornton’s Ironworkers and the
B. have developed the habit of
swooping down on country towns that
previously knew them not. Their arrival
is usually followed by an outcrop of
“New Housewives” and an outbreak of
“spontaneous” protests against high prices
and demands for less work and more pay.
These gentry won’t be hampered in their
touring activities by cuts in the railway
services forced on the country by the
action of their mining cobbers. Trans-
port Minister Ward revealed in the House
last week, in answer to a question, that in
the 21 months to last June ten permits
to buy new cars had been issued to the
8.W.1.U. and six to the Ironworkers’
Federation. The Ironworkers had all
plumped for 29-h.p. Chevrolet sedans—no
shortage of dollars for that quarter, appa-
rently. The no-building crowd shouted
themselves five of the big dollar-buming
Chevs ; the rest of their fleet were 10-h.p.
Morris, Ford and Hillman sedans.
Along with other High Commissioners
in London Jack Beasley is now entitled
to the label “His Excellency,” and at
official bun-fights will rank with
foreign Ambassadors. Nearly a century
ago Arabian-Nights Burton ran into a
spot of precedency trouble and dealt with
it in his own way. Appointed British
Consul at Santos in Brazil, he went to
an official dinner at the palace of
Emperor Dom Pedro to find that Consuls
were a penny a dozen. Cold-shouldered
at the door of every ante-room in which
Ministers were waiting, he grabbed a
flunkey, scribbled a, message on a card
and sent it into the Emperor. Dom Pedro
sent for him, and the dinner was held
up for half an hour while Burton held
the Imperial ear with fascinating yams
of the East. It’s an example Beasley
would find hard to emulate. Burton had
already made his journey to Mecca,
served in India, discovered Lake Tan-
ganyika and written half a dozen books.
He was the greatest linguist of his day,
a grand raconteur and probably the best
swordsman in Europe. Beasley’s experi-
ence of lethal weapons is confined to
the ballpoint fountain-pen; his explora-
tions to the West Sydney electorate.
In the Caucus-approved naming of
N. S. Wales Federal electorates there has
been much juggling to the end that the
monickers of shaky seats now held by
“Labor” shall be transferred to new seats
safe for the party. Haylen and Daly, for
instance, provided they get the nomina-
tion, will be sitters for Parkes and Martin,
though the voters in the electorates now
graced with those names have for the
most part not previously enjoyed the
•privilege of having their interests looked
after by Les and Dilly. The arrangement
brought forth some criticism when it was
bruited abroad that the A.L.P. executive
intended to give sitting members exemp-
tion from facing pre-selection ballots.
According to the “Standard,” A.L.P.
president Ferguson “quashed” the rumor.
The manner of the quashing was a state-
ment that the executive had not con-
sidered the matter. Perhaps it hasn’t —
yet.
The Hanlons have amended their Sup-
pression of Gambling Acts to allow the
broadcasting of jockeys’ names and
barrier-positions before the start of
Queensland races, a “privilege” enjoyed
by southern s.p. punters. During the
debate Mr. Pie of the Kewpies invited
the Government to register a limited
number of s.p. bookies and make the
first fine up to £lOOO for illegal bookies.
The debate was adjourned with what
sounded like a gasp of horror.
Bang in the middle of it as they are
the Swiss have no illusions about the
“cold war.” Their Federal Council has
banned “extremist parties of both Left
and Right and Communist organisa-
tions.” Anyone working to overthrow
the Government by other than constitu-
tional means is liable to life imprison-
ment. It might be an idea for the Immi-
gration Minister to bring the Swiss
Family Robinson out to Canberra.
The N. S. Wales coal strike began as
the hold-up on the French fields was
petering-out. The Kemeira tunnel is
half a world away from Lorraine, but
Thorez and the leaders of the Miners’
Federation, brothers-in-Stalin, are actu-
ated by the same motives, and the two
strikes served the same purpose, which is
to delay industrial recovery in the de-
mocracies and so improve Russia’s posi-
tion relatively to the Western world.
The Comrades indignantly deny that
basher tactics and stone-throwing are
part of their methods of ensuring
“loyalty” on the South Coast, but they
are not averse to approving a well-
chucked stone provided it goes in the
right direction. Their Sydney mouth-
piece, “Tribune,” has a roving reporter
in Europe. Illustrating his article
“French Workers Fight De Gaulle,
Marshall Plan Poverty” is a photograph
of a wounded policeman with the caption
“Steel-helmet was not sufficient to pro-
tect this gendarme from a well-aimed
piece of concrete.”
It has been here said repeatedly that
the limited currency of petrol coupons is
not only unfair to many motorists, but
tends to defeat the object of rationing
in that it induces many to buy petrol they
don’t really want. Asked whether the
currency couldn’t be extended, Mr.
Chifley told Mr. Corser (C.P.) that' it
would be “impossible ; the two-month
limit on currency of coupons is an attempt
to defeat forgeries.” That’s not a reason,
it’s an excuse —and a mighty poor one.
Seamen’s Union secretary Elliott,
appearing in an overtime claim before
Conciliation Commissioner Hamilton
Knight, was told by the former N.S.W,
Minister for La'bor, after frequent inter-
jections, that unless he kept quiet he
would not be heard. The talkative Com-
munist replied, “I’m riot here to be heard.
I’m here to get double time.” Hamilton
Knight remarked “You are not a gentle-
man,” whereupon Elliott told him “That
would be impossible. I am an Australian
worker.” The retort reveals the warped
mentality of the Moscow-indoctrinated
misfits who dominate several big Aus-
tralian unions. Do the majority of Aus-
tralian workers agree with Elliott that
because they are workers they cannot be
gentlemen? Do their wives agree that
they are not?
Queensland Government’s “new system
of imposing transport fees,” which was
supposed to liberalise Government con-
trol of private road transport, has re-
sulted in doubling the year’s revenue
from that source—£2l7,ooo as compared
with £107,000 under the “old” system.
“New” or “old” the tax is simply a
penal one on anyone daring U compete
with the Government railways. It’s such
a good thing that the Transport Commis-
sioner is thinking of taxing water-trans-
port within the State—if Queenslanders
will stand for it.
The “cold war” against Communism
in Europe had a decided influence on the
Brisbane wool *sales last week, where
prices were good partly due to Italian
buying. “Courier-Mail” noted that
“buyers explained that these purchases
were being financed largely by Marshall
aid, for the urgent rehabilitation of mills,
as a counter to Communism in Italy's
troubled industrial northern centres.”
Complaints that the Hanlon Govern-
ment would allow all the profits on the
Blair Athol opencut coalfield to go to
overseas shareholders have been answered
in part by Acting-Premier Gair. The
British corporations which are to develop
the field are to float a local company in
Queensland, and Australian investors will
be given an opportunity to take up shares.
There is talk, too, of an oil-from-coal
project ', Chifley told the Reps, on Friday
that his Government had had this in mind
in removing the excise duty from locally-
produced oil.
It is not pleasant to have to accept
home-truths about Australian policy
from outsiders, but no one who has fol-
lowed the disgraceful record of our deal-
ings with Dutch since 1945 can
honestly dispute the statement of Dr. Van
Mook, former Lieutenant Governor-
General of N.E.I. In Singapore he told
reporters that this country has no foreign
policy regarding Indonesia “apart from
personal ambitions and ideas.” He’s quite
right. Doc! Evatt supplies the ambition ;
Marx House and the wharfies the ideas.
“The Socialists are first the door-
openers and then the doormats of the
Communists.” The comment was made at
the Conservative conference at Llan-
dudno ; it applies equally in Australia and
in Britain —or anywhere else, for that
matter.
If you. are making a big claim make it
really big. Sydney “Tribune” in a special
supplement celebrating the anniversary of
the Bolshevik Revolution: “The Soviet
peace proposals have the support of
thousands of millions of people.” The
World Almanac gives the estimated total
population of the world as not much
above two thousand million.
Brisbane “Courier-Mail” printed this
caption under a picture of the gentle-
man: “N.S.W. Premier (Mr. Baddeley)
arriving at Parliament House, Sydney,
yesterday for a conference with the Joint
Coal Board.” A pardonable error; even
the N. S. Welsh themselves aren’t sure
whether their Premier’s name is Ross,
Sharkey, Ward, Williams, Munro,
Romano or McGirr.
, A Road Safety Council recommenda-
tion is that all motorists should have
their eyes tested every two years. At
present this is enforced only in Can-
berra. That seems to be a doubtful
recommendation ; the more prominent in-
habitants of that city still seem capable
of seeing with only one eye.
At the week-end, with major blackouts
threatening industry, Melbourne’s im-
mediate worry was still the bread strike.
Under the Government’s emergency-
baking decree those who didn’t consider
the stuff black were at least getting their
half-a-loaf—provided they were pre-
pared to call for it —and round about one
in three bread-carters were ignoring the
Trades Hall order not to deliver to shops.
Railwaymen had been told by their union
not to handle any parcel that looked like
bread, and most suburbanites were reach-
ing the stage where they couldn’t look an-
other home-made scone in the face. All
this sort of thing is supposed to serve the
cause of unionism or democracy or some-
thing.

• Until Mrs. Suda Wells, his 83-year-old
cousin, blew the gaff recently, few people
knew what the “S” in the middle of Harry
S. Truman’s name stood for. She insists it
is Solomon, and that he doesn’t like ad-
mitting it, telling biographers that the
letter stands for nothing in particular—it
was just put there because his parents
weren’t game to differentiate between his
two granddads, Solomon and Shipp. It’s
only fair to reveal that Mrs. Wells comes
from the Solomon side of the family—-the
Shipps haven’t been heard from yet.
With no pay increase since 1909, the
U.S. President is actually one of the most

A note from the West: The day after
Jack Simons’s death (B. 3/11 /’4B), no
fewer than 46 obituaries were inserted in
the one issue of the “West Australian.”
The words “Boss” and “friend” appeared
together in all 46.
A partnership that had brought ines-
timable benefit to the people of South
Australia’s Far West Coast was broken
by the death in Adelaide, at 43, of Dr.
Robert Welch Gibson, who with his wife
conducted the Flying Doctor service of
the Bush Church Aid Society from head-
quarters at Ceduna (S.A.). “Roy and
Freda,” as an engaged couple, put up
with the friendly banter of fellow
medical students at Adelaide ’Varsity,
graduated together in 1931, were married
not long afterwards and, in 1933, opened
a joint practice at Ceduna, a small sea-
port on the Great Australian Bight, Be-
sides being family doctors to all the small
townships and isolated farms within a
day’s journey of the port they were soon
operating an aerial medical service across
the Nullarbor Plain to places as far afield
as the trans-continental railway. Dr.
Freda will now carry on the job alone
as she did during the war years when her
husband was away with the Forces; her
grand work in that period earned her an
0.8. E.
“Macnell” salutes an Admiral: When on De-
cember 11, 1944, the Admiralty announced that
the most powerful British Fleet ever sent out of
home waters was to be dispatched to Australia
and the Pacific, it guaranteed the strength of
the unit by giving its command to Admiral Sir
Bruce Austin Fraser, who last month went up
one step to the Royal Navy’s highest command —
Admiral of the Fleet. Though his squat body
and round, bluff face lacked the public appeal
of Mountbatten’s good looks, Fraser held during
the war the Navy’s most important appoint-
ments with unvarying success. As C.-in-C. of
the Home Fleet he forced convoys up to Mur-
mansk through punishing weather and unremit-
ting U-boat and air attacks; and finally beat
the life out of the U-boat packs in the Atlantic.
His personal conduct of the Scharnhorst hunt
was a model of its kind. The German battle-
cruiser picked on what she thought was a
cruiser-escorted convoy. For hours the three
eight-inchers fought her off, .until Fraser in
battleship Duke of York came thrashing over
the horizon. Duke of York got in range, heaved
her vast bulk broadside-on to bring all guns
to bear and let go. Hit by a ton of armor-
piercing shell the German cleared for her life.
Fraser loosed his destroyer pack. They opened
her up with three torpedoes, slowed her down
and the British battler shot her to scrap at
close range. Then cruiser Jamaica finished her
with a torpedo. Of her company of 1460 36
were saved. At the Lingayen landing Fraser
narrowly escaped death when, on the bridge of
the U.S. battleship New Mexico, a Kamikaze
picked it for his target, killing the captain and
Lt.-Gen. Lumsden, Churchill’s personal repre-
sentative with MacArthur. Not generally known
is the fact that the new Admiral of the Fleet
was once jailed. Sent to Baku in 1920 with a
naval mission at the request of the Azerbaijan
Republic, the visitors found on arrival a revolu-
tion had changed Governments, and the new
crowd promptly threw them into jail. It took
several months of high-level negotiations to get
them out.
The breed lives on. Fred Yeowart, a
54-year-old Old Digger who thought he’d
like to live in N. Queensland, travelled
from Brisbane to Cairns to do it. That
trip might be as common as a telephone,
except that in this case the man who did
it has no legs and pushed himself the
1500 miles in his wheel-chair. When he
came to a hill too steep to trundle up he
levered himself out and plodded up on
his stumps, amputated below the knees.
Naturally tender, one of them developed
a cyst, but it wasn’t till two months and
17 days after that he had a doctor look
at it in Cairns hospital. Travelling
mainly at night—his vehicle carried lights
—he was never offered a lift by any of
the cars passing him. Anyone knowing
the Black Mountains near Kingaroy, over
which he passed, will agree that though
Yeowart lacked enough money to travel
any other way there’s not much else he
hasn’t got.
“Fitz”: Apologising for being unable to
attend a meeting of the Henry Lawson Society
in Sydney, poet Roderic Quinn wrote to me
last week: “I am no better able to trust myself
out-of-doors at night than when I saw you a
month ago. Even by day so unwilling are my
feet that I feel and find it difficult to fare far
from my abiding-place.” Rodeiic, who will be
79 on November 26, may not feel up to the
strain of battling to town and back after dusk,
but when this scribe called on him at the
Waverley home of Lucy Cassidy a month ago
he found Rod as mentally alert as of yore.
Seated in the deep-cushioned armchair pre-
sented to him by his literary friends, Rod was
in his most engaging conversational mood, and
as the pleasant room filled with tobacco-smoke
the old poet told many a grand yarn of the
days when he was finding his feet on the Inky
Way. Rod has been a Bulletin bard for more
than 50 years. His first verse, “A Dreamer,”
appeared in the issue of March 21, 1894. In
a letter to Zora Cross, Rod wrote “I was born
in Surry Hills, so close to Woolloomooloo that
I sometimes think that I am entitled to claim
the ’Loo as my birthplace.” The son of a
Galway man who came to Sydney in the gold-
rush era, Rod would have been proud to have
been a native of the ’Loo, but I sometimes
think that he would rather have been bom on
the “wild western coast of the Green Isle.”
Rod was surely thinking of his father’s home-
land when he wrote:
All night a great wind blew across the land,
Came fresh from wild and salty seas.
I mentioned to him that David tvicivee Wright
had hailed from Ballynaskeagh and Victor Daley
from Navan, and told a story about John
Farrell’s brogue. “Ah, poor old Jack!”
chuckled Rod. “He was born in South
America, yet had a lovely Irish brogue until the
day he died. Now, I remember” And Rod
remembered and I remembered and Lucy Cas-
sidy gently corrected us when memory strayed.
Rod saw me to the gate of the neat little
cottage and expressed the hope that he would
be able to pay a visit to The Bulletin office in
the near future. When I got back to town I
mentioned my visit to a non-literary friend, and
told him how Rod, when a youth, worked for
a produce merchant and was fired for sending
out an account to the firm’s best customer for
£BO instead of £B. “Just fancy,” I said. “Rod
Working in a hay-and-corn store.” “What’s
wrong with that?” countered my friend, think-
ing of present shortage. “He’d at least stand
a chance of getting a few spuds.”
This is a Prior impression of Carman
Croft, Canada’s Trade Commissioner in
Sydney, caught while thinking-up another
panegyric on Australia’s scenery. Hav-
ing returned from a car trip up N.S.W.
North Coast, then through Brisbane and
the Darling Downs, and having seen a
good portion of the globe in the 25 years

manent abode. He was commercial sec-
retary in Tokyo for four years, got out

Dr. Allan Vickers, caught by Heth
grounded in Sydney, has been a flying

to appeal for more funds —his practice
ranges over 250,000- sq. miles, and he
flies 50,000 miles a year in covering it.
A versatile cove, he can fly himself, plot
his pilot’s position and give him a course
to the next call, service the radio —the
plane, too, if necessary—and be prepared
for all sorts of emergency servicing of
humans when he lands—the Australian
bushman not being in the habit of squeal-
ing unless he’s really hurt. Vickers plays
down the dramatic side of his job ; what
he’s after is not a reputation for brilliant
“saves” under primitive conditions, but
a sense of security in the outback, so that
men, with wives and families, will not be
deterred from opening up our northern
spaces by the fear of helplessness in cases
of physical hurt. Queensland station-men
know that if they are really sick they’ll
be in a hospital bed probably sooner than
they would be if living in Brisbane. There
is only one complaint, and that from the
male element. Most stations now have
battery transceivers, which means there
is no pedal-pushing, limit to vocal output
of their women.
Golfers being what they are, solicitor
W. Treybaud, of Hampton (Vic.),
couldn’t have wished for a better place
to die—on the 18th green of the course
hp was playing. A day or so later tax
expert Reg Cheadle told Ted Scorfield
on Cammeray links that he’d met a
friend of Ted’s in New York, Billy
Albert, The Bulletin’s rep. there. “I’ll
tell you all about it after the game,” said
Cheadle. He squared up to putt out the
third hole, bent over and kept on falling.
Just over 20 years ago James Fairfax,

Some husbands, at least, owe a debt of
gratitude to an Englishman now in Aus-
tralia—Colonel E. A. Shipton, managing-
director of Ward, Lock and Co., which
publishes Mrs. Beeton’s Cookery Book,
by far the company’s best-seller; in de-
mand second only to the Bible, Shipton
believes. His grandfather bought the
publishing interests of the lady’s husband
80 years ago, but the book has altered a
lot since then. Twenty years ago the
recipes (originally prepared for the large
families of Queen Vic.’s day) were
halved, and every year new and tested
prescriptions are addr J. Husbands used

Swedish architectural trends will influ-
ence the design of three-storey flats
which, some day, will replace 100 acres
of slums in Redfern, Sydney.' Man on
the job is Walter Bunning, who, at 36, is
chairman of the State’s Town and Coun-
try Planning Committee, which has Sir
Patrick Abercrombie here from England
to advise on overseas developments.
Bunning knows a bit about that himself
—he toured Europe and America on a
Board of Architects’ scholarship just be-
fore the war, and found that Sweden’s
cultural level is far above that of any
other country. There—Quay-railway ex-
perts note —builders in the city must
present plans of the proposed edifice to
the public for approval and suggestions
before work can begin. He saw what
the Scandinavian countries and Germany,
Belgium, Italy, Ireland and America have
to offer, and in New York he helped to
design the British and Irish Pavilions at
the 1939 World Fair. Another big job
in hand is a town-planning scheme for
St. Mary’s, near Penrith (N.S.W.), whose
15 sq. miles of munition factories will be
turned into a model town for 15,000
people, again in the Swedish fashion.
Shortages admitted, the scope for new
construction is great and obvious ; and
behind a quiet exterior Bunning hides
ambitions in planning to match his size.
Doyen of Sydney’s music critics, 70-
year-old A. L. Kelly, of the “Sun,”
passed on in Sydney last Week after a
brief illness. A former teacher and later
lecturer at the Teachers’ College at the
University, he had for over 40 years been
a keen student and lover of the art on
which he ably wrote. A kindly man, he
especially eschewed the critical brickbat
where the young, struggling concert artist
was concerned, and, though he pulled no
punches against those well able to stand
the knocks, he encouraged home-grown-
talent in all musical spheres. Confessing
a fervent admiration for Bellerive, “A.L.”
once dropped in on The Bulletin to beg
an original MS. of one of that bard’s
“Answers to Correspondents” master-
pieces as a souvenir.
Cyril Dqcker is a hearty man in a
hearty job—-Sydney’s host to the 2000-
odd of Royal Vanguard’s ship’s com-
pany next year. When Renown was here
with the present King and Queen in 1927,
Sydney turned it on thoroughly, and.
Docker, as hon. administrator of the
hospitality committee, will put the “enter”
into “entertainment” for the lads this
time. A Bulletin man who called to
see what was cooking, knowing some-
thing of sailors’ likes and dislikes ashore,
suggested long car rides by day and
dances at night, with a minimum of
speeches—the breed having an aversion
to any but the delivery end of broad-
sides. Docker already had that in mind,
and batches of men will be sent to large
country centres, whose Mayors will take
over from there. An Old Digger, Docker
toured England and S. Africa with the
A.I.F. cricket team in 1919, from which
Warwick Armstrong picked five —Collins,
Oldfield, Taylor, Jack Gregory and
Pellew —for his 1921 Test team. The
second outbreak found him chief warden
of Sydney’s N.E.S. and hon. adminis-
trator of the State’s Comforts Fund. He
turned £2\ million into toothpaste, soap,
plum puddings and so on, and at the
end sold the remaining stock, which
leaves a sizeable sum awaiting distribu-
tion. Ample proportions of figure and
smile make Docker look his part, and
he’ll probably enjoy every minute of it.
Into the silence:
At Warrandyte (Vic.), Francis Crozier, artist,
at 64. Appointed official war artist in the
1914-18 war after serving in the 22nd Battalion
on Gallipoli and in France, he was well known
as a painter of landscapes, in addition to his
works in the National War Memorial Museum
at Canberra.
At Christchurch (M.L.), at 90, John H.
Fisher, art dealer, whose shop was a rendezvous
for artists since his father established it in 1870.
A few of the men who blew in for advice
were John Gully, M.L.’s foremost landscape
painter, Count Nerli, whose Louis Stevenson
portrait now adorns the Scottish Academy, and
Petrus van der Velden. Christchurch owes to
Fisher its fine collection of works by M.L.
artists.
Victim of a car accident in Sydney, Arthur
Bennetts, president of the N.S.W.R.S.L. Club.
An Old Digger, known universally as “Doc.,”
he was a generous, genial cove, who made and
kept friends easily. But none of them knew
the origin of his nickname.
At Glen Osmond (S.A.), at 45, Allan
Humphries, former sec. of the State’s Wheat
and Wool Growers’ and Pig Breeders’ Associa-
tions. A graduate of Roseworthy Agricultural
College, whose farm he later superintended, he
joined the “Advertiser,” and was well known
to primary producers as “Barbadilling” of the
“Chronicle.”
In Melbourne, at 89, John Henry Loxton

“AND IT'S FRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS”
“Bo”: Often in a lift, noticing that the
only other passenger had a head of hair
with a mass of tight little waves arranged
with mathematical precision, I have
politely removed my lid only to find at
a second glance that the owner of the
perm, wore a collar and tie. The revela-
tion that such pansies do have their hair
waved regularly and that the general in-
cidence of “men” thus having themselves
allegedly beautified is on the increase has
been made by a Sydney hairdresser who
expects to open a salon for this exclusive
purpose. If the object of the creatures
who submit themselves to this ordeal in
the interests of masculine pulchritude is
to try to trick girls into believing that
the wave is a natural one they’ve done
their cash in cold blood —any daughter
of Eve can tell instantly whether a wave
is dinkum or a phoney. But he would
have to be a strong-stomached man who
would take on the job of administering
perms to pansies and listening to their
chatter about Wellers and Onduluxes.
For myself I find that a touch of No. 1
sandpaper is infinitely more effective
than a wet-set.

“J.J.A.”: Official jargon? A parcel
from a Government department arrived
at the factory the other day bearing a
label, on the back of which was written
the words “No Packets inside to are not
sending others as we are not.” We
tossed up a double-headed penny to de-
cide whether Government departments
run at a loss through having to decipher
such messages or through spending
money to have them written.

“Mullum”: My own experience of an
attempt at simpler wording in official
letters. I began a letter to a department
head in Sydney: “Please send” The

we were trying to push him around, and
would send nothing.” So I wrote the
letter again: “We should be glad if you
would endeavor to supply”

“Muskeen”: Winston Churchill’s face
may have been fresh when his escape
from the Boers put him on the cigarette-
cards, but according to “Smiler” Hales’s
description of him “there was no need
for mountains, rivers or forests or any
of the work of the Creator, when that
young man was around. Winston was
there and the work of the Creator was
complete.” “Smiler” wrote that his
escape was the result of a dream. Chur-
chill dreamt that he opened the door of
his prison with a gold key, and asked his
guard for an interpretation. The Boer
said he would give his private opinion

“Spinet”: Cigarette-cards (B.
6/10/’48)? My childhood was gladdened
not only by a varied collection of cards
but also by a fine Hawk-eye camera ex-
changed by the tobacco manufacturers
for 100 coupons. The uncle who smoked
furiously to get me the last 40 coupons
before the offer expired never touched
that brand again.

“T.G.A.”: “That man Grey” of the
Sydney Domain, mentioned by “W.P.T.”
(B. 27/10/’4B), was the typical American
travelling salesman of his day, re-
splendent in frock-coat, wide-brimmed
black hat and knotted tie. On week-days
he peddled a sulphur-tinted concoction
he called “bootar” from a stand on a
vacant lot in Pitt-street. He explained at
great length the virtues of the various
ingredients, but the main one was “best
known to myself.” Other Domain identi-
ties included McArthur, the champion of
the anti-papists, A. G. Huie, with his
taxation problems, Rev. Walker and
George the vegetarian. And there was
Mr. Catts —a kindly old soul with long
beard who stood alongside a scroll on
which appeared the Ten Commandments.
His audience usually consisted of the
youth of the day, who asked ludicrous
questions, sang ribald songs and parodies
such as “When the beer is on. the table
and the counter-lunch is thickest'we’ll be
there.” Near by was a Russian agnostic
who spoke in guttural tones professing
astonishment at the credulity of Jonah’s
“I'll attend to this customer, Featonby .”
wife. Two Domain orators who gradu-
ated to Parliament were A. D. Kay and
Donald Grant. Kay, an exponent of in-
dividual effort, was a natural comedian
who generally talked for three hours,
saying almost nothing worth while but
keeping his audience in happy mood.
Grant, an astute, purposeful and fiery
orator, used to preach “Down with capi-
talism.” He is still preaching it in the
Senate.

“Salt Junk Joe”: I don’t want to drag
this Roaring Forties argument on till
Christmas, but “Gravelsnatcher’s” talk of
pedantry (B. 3/11 /’4B) brings me in once
more. Surely he and “The Showman”
do not believe that local usage in the
bottom corner of Westralia makes an
expression part of the language? If that
is their view they had better watch out;
Senator McKenna will be trying to bring
their “Fremantle doctor” into his
national-health scheme. On the subject
of local usage, the lighthouse-keeper on
Cape Naturaliste doesn’t seem to have
weighed-irr yet. If there’s no word from
him within a fortnight I’ll call on “The
Showman” to line-up those drinks he
promised.
“Noo Yoik”: Youse guys have been
wasting your time shooting your mouths
off about the “Roaring Forties.” Any
kid from the Bronx could tell you where
they are and what they are without quot-
ing lighthouse-keepers or windbag
sailors. Walk up Seventh-avenue, New
York, till you come to 42nd-street and
Times Square and you’ll be right in the
heart of the Roaring Forties. Go there
when New York has any reason for cele-
brating and you’ll get all the storms you
want. Usually election night sees mad
and merry scenes in those parts, but, ac-
cording to the cables, this year was an
exception ; the crowds were so quiet that
New York “Times” declared the area
had become “the snoring forties.”
“Zake”: Of all the articles which go
to make up man’s habiliments none is
more treacherous than the bootlace. One
takes it for granted, and its appearance
never gives the slightest indication that
it is anything but strong. The only time
extra strain is put upon it is when its
wearer is in a hurry to tie it —usually
when he has a minute to catch a bus —
and that’s the time it invariably goes. I
have never known a bootlace to break
anywhere but in the vicinity of the
middle eyelets, where temporary repairs
are most awkward—what man, after all,
ever thinks of laying in a stock of
spares? Which leads me to ask—why did
the metallic laces which came on the
market about 20 years ago have so brief
a life? They snapped on in series up the
eyelets, and they could be adjusted in a
second or two. They left no gaps as the
flexible laces do and they didn’t come
undone. It is ! one of the few common-
sense inventions in men’s dress that I can
recall which failed to survive or be im-
proved upon.
* * * *
“Clooter”: A latter-day phenomenon
is the number of married coqples that
can be observed in city hotels and
licensed holiday-joints absorbing beer-for-
beer with, the intent concentration that
was once the prerogative of mates of the
male sex only. I was struck by it at a
holiday hotel, where the couples timed
their walks and sport so as to reach the
pubbery at specified drinking hours —a
chalked notice carried the legend, “Beer
on at 10.30 a.m.” or “3.30 p.m.” On
these occasions the talk invariably ran
on the quality of the various beers and
sundry suburban and city pubs which
the couples had made their drinking-
ground on Saturdays and those new
afternoon hours provided by the 40-hour
week. Jt also came out that most of the
couples lived in rooms, small flats or with
in-laws or, in other words, couldn’t get
houses in which to live. It seems that
the married woman confined to such
quarters has found relief in beer, and
it is to her credit that she drinks mostly
with her husband. Before any wild-eyed
prohibitionist arises to condemn them let
me ask where else the poor things can
go?
* * * *
“23-4”: That chap who turned to his
dictionary for the meaning of “livid”
and “lurid” (B. 3/11 /’4B) seems to have
got slightly mixed. I don’t think many
people associate red with livid, and I
always assumed the word meant some-
thing the color of lead or of a bruise.
Your livid man is one whose face has
turned a purply-bluej which is close
enough. As for lurid as applied to
language, Webster’s third definition is
“harshly or ominously vivid,” and if that
isn’t the kind of language “B. A. Ker”
uses when his income-tax assessment
arrives I’ll buy the drinks.

“Old Screw”: Undergoing a face-lift
for the Royal visit, Perth’s Town Hall
has been the subject of controversy;
whether the half-loops of rope that crown
each of the four circular windows of the
tower should be removed as symbolical of
the better-forgotten convict past. Also
like the hangman’s rope are the
broad-arrow casements which adorn the
corners of the tower. The decision not
to interfere with these adornments has
suggested the consolation that similar
architectural features are to be found in
other parts of the world. Maybe, but
it is a safe bet that the man responsible
for the placing of the signs-manual of its
builders on the Perth Town Hall did it
with a grim chuckle. John Stephen
Hampton had been a ruler of Port Arthur
prior to his appointment as Governor
of W.A. As a driver of convicts he was
second only to John Price. Still, despite
his harshness he was a fine administrator
and organiser of public works. With
convict labor he started the building of
Perth’s Town Hall, presenting it as a free
gift to the infant capital. One can well
understand how, as he watched the
hundreds of toiling slaves, he decided
with grim humor that they should at least
leave their signature on the pile they had
so laboriously constructed. And, cer-
tainly, in the bhilding of so fine a cam-
panile those Crown prisoners worked out
their redemption.
* * * *
“Uramao”: The unusual appearance of
a fine wristlet-watch on a Kiwi who had
spent five years overseas prompted me tq
ask where he got it. He told me that ofiq
day in Italy a pair of Maoris marched
half a dozen Jerry prisoners into camp.
A party of Kiwis, including my friend,
jocularly sang out “Kia ora” to the
Maoris. Immediately the Germans
stripped off their wristlet-watches and
handed them over. From living among
the Italians they knew that “che pro”
was inquiring the time, but were ignorant
of the Maori greeting. “The way we
reckoned it,” said the Kiwi, “it was a
free gift. After all, we didn’t ask for
’em.”

“Aux Dames”': Consideration* for de
facto wives (B. 20/10 / ’48)? At the start
of the war—when enlisting Old Diggers
in the Garrison Battalion—the official
form provided straight out for “un-
married wives” (Form W.F. 9A). Shortly
afterwards somebody changed it to “de
facto wives” —defined in regulations
thus: i
“De facto wife” means, in relation to
any member, any woman who for a period
of not less than six months immediately
prior to member’s enlistment or appointment
lived with him as his wife though not legally
married to him.
Later still, as even de facto was con-
sidered to have a slur in it, there was a
further change to “dependent female” —
thus eliminating all difference between
“mistresses” and other female depend-
ants.

“L.M.”: “F.E.L.” (B. 27/10/’4B) is
right in saying Dumas made a boner over
Botany Bay, but he had better re-read
The Three Musketeers. Milady was
captured before the assassination of
Buckingham, and she exerted all her great
fascination on the austere puritan Felton,
who, completely enslaved, assisted her to
escape. Instead of waiting until he had
killed the Duke, she set sail for France
in the boat Felton had provided for their
joint escape.

“Llewelyq”: Bivouacked in the Canal
zone in 1941, we were under admini-
strative control of an Imperial garrison
regiment whose standing orders were de-
livered daily to our orderly-room by an
“old sweat” mounted on a bicycle which
looked as if it had been on regi-
mental strength since Quatre Bras. One
day the grid disappeared into thin air
during the few seconds in which the
rider was delivering his orders. When
our sergeants’ mess learned that the
ancient warrior had been “crimed” and
fined six quid for losing the antique a
tarpaulin-muster brought £3 10s. News
drifted down to the men’s lines and pro-
duced not the missing grid but the sum
of £l7 10s. The lot was handed over
next day to an incredulous though pro-
fanely grateful old sweat.

“Tos”: “Hannan’s St.” (B. 22/9/’4B),
writing of the early days of Kalgoorlie,
says “the Australian felt-hat industry
was as yet unborn ” I don’t know
the exact years he refers to, but as the
son, grandson and great-grandson of
practical hatters, I remember my father
telling me, quite 55 years ago, that one
of his brothers was secretary or organiser
of the Felt Hatters’ Union. My grand-
father, Benjamin Smith, who worked at
the trade in London, as did his father
before him, brought his three sons out
to Melbourne when they were boys.
They were all put to the hatting trade.
Tom became M.L.A. for Emerald Hill
(Vic.) and Mayor of Port and South Mel-
bourne. George went to Tasmania as
manager of Bidencope’s factory, when he
was little over 21, at the munificent salary
of £3 a week: and in control of about 30
men and women. He later opened his
own hatting business, and when he retired
became an alderman of the City of Hobart
and chairman of the Hobart Hospital. I
found after his death, in 1928, his
“Articles of Apprenticeship,” hand-
written, and in almost archaic language.
There was certainly a hatting industry
as far back as 1865 ; it may have been
mostly silk-hat making, but I feel sure
felts were also in production.
THE MISSING LINK.
“A fossilised skull of a prehistoric ape, showing
near-human features and estimated to be between 20
and 25 million years old, has been discovered in East
Africa.' It will go to Oxford University for de-
tailed study by experts.”— Cable.
Is this indeed that hypothetic creature,
The Missing Link ’twixt simians and mankind,
Darwinians have never failed to feature
But, up till now at least, have failed to find,
The being to establish the connection
Between our stock and dim arboreal shapes,
The evidence ,to prove beyond correction
Our ancestors were apes?
How strange, how passing strange, it should be
taking
Nothing beyond a stony skull to show
Mankind was definitely in the making
A score of millions of years ago.
When Science turns its searchlight on a few of
The problems so bewildering as this,
It’s clearly time to reconstruct your view of
Eden and Genesis.
How long, one well may ask, since the begin-
ning
Of life upon the regions where we range,
Since somebody or something started spinning
This earth along “the spinning grooves of
change,”
If it be sons since the institution
Of genus homo, so to speak, began,
That final masterpiece of evolution,
The dim red dawn of man?
The Missing Link! What story lurks behind
him,
Hidden beneath a prehistoric past!
It took a devil of a time to find him,
I wonder if they’ve run him down at last,
One of the founders of our race whose gump-
tion
And grit so served him that he upward sprang
From the gorilla—it’s a fair assumption—
Or the orang-outang.
Pity his skull is all to base deductive
' Theories on, touching how he became
Just what he was, with data more instructive
Lacking, like other portions of his frame.
Still, erudite professors will be duly
Impressed with this exhibit, one must think,
And Oxford thrilled to gaze on what may truly
Turn out the Missing Link.

T. THE R.


“Minto”: We were bound from
Finschhafen to Townsville in 1943, and
the passengers in our Douglas seemed a
bit anxious, as Jap marauders were still
giving cheek in that area. We rose
steadily after take-off and flattened out
at 3000 ft. Finschhafen dropped behind,
and in a cloudless sky we seemed set for
a pleasant trip. Suddenly the skipper
jolted the aircraft to starboard and up
in a stiff climb to 7000 ft. Anxious faces
peered out the windows. The aircraft
flattened out, then up in another stiff
climb to 9000 ft. We dropped to 8000 ft.,
and then the skipper pulled the stick
back hard and up we went to 12,000 ft.
The passengers were getting short of
breath and shorter still of confidence. I
left my radio and went to the skipper for
instructions. “Shake him off?” I asked.
The skipper turned to me and grinned.
“Yes, I’ve shaken the blighter off all
right, but he was obstinate. It was
11,000 ft. before he fell off. He was on
the altimeter when we took off and I
made up my mind I’d shift him.” He
leant over and picked up a fly from the
cockpit floor.

Asked the authority for this statement, he

“Pongo”: Don’t know about Lord
George Bentinck being unable to sell
sovereigns for shillings (B. 27/10/’4B), but
I saw Newton, the “American Sales-
man” of the ’nineties, sell pieces of
folded paper at a quid a time. One of
the cleverest spruikers imaginable,
Newton worked the shows and suburbs

travelling in a gilded carriage drawn by
a pair of white horses. He operated from
a platform about Bft high. Several board-
walks at head-level were provided, and
from these, pert, scanty-skirted damsels
delivered goods to purchasers in the
crowd. After selling a few purses con-
taininp “five sovereisns for a nound ”
taming nve sovereigns tor a pouna,
Newton got down to business. Now, I m
not promising you anything,” he would
roar. “But just to see how many specula-
tors there are here, who’ll give me a quid
for one of these pieces of paper?” He
usually sold all he offered, and mostly
the speculators went unrewarded. Newton
knew the law and worked within its
limits. He was one of the first men to
sell rolled-gold watches and chains in
Australia, and, until the gold wore off,
his clients thought they’d got bargains.

“V. Cluse”: It doesn’t matter much,
but doesn’t “P. Penwiper” (B. 3/11/ ’4B)
confirm rather than deny my claim that
“good iron” probably arrived with our
British forebears when he says it de-
scribed a good throw at iron quoits?
Iron quoits were a feature of English
village greens long before they became
popular here in the ’nineties.

“Karrimba”: Signs of the times? On
a recent voyage from Melbourne to Syd-
ney on a coastal vessel, no w.onder of
the deep, neither whales* sharks, por-
poises nor albatrosses caused such in-
terest to the trippers as a small, very dirty
1 and very heavily-laden tramp-steamer
pushing its way south through dirty
weather. My mystification at the rush
to the rails and the cheers that were
raised was dispelled when a Melbourne
acquaintance reported that the uncon-
scious cause of so much excitement was
a collier with-a cargo for the gas com-
pany.

“Laetitia”: Arrests of American
officers on charges of purloining quasi-
historic jewel pieces recall a major
scandal of the Edwardian era —the dis-
appearance of the jewels of the Order of
St. Patrick from Dublin Castle. The
Commission of Inquiry charged Sir
Arthur Vicars, Ulster King of Arms, with
dilatory conduct in the custody of the
insignia, and such was dignity of public
men in those days that he resigned im-
mediately, though his was a purely
nominal responsibility and he could
easily have passed the buck to a long
line of subordinates. His resignation did
not save Birrell, Secretary for Ireland,
from acute embarrassment. The mystery
was never solved, though Dame Rumor
was indecently prolific in regard to
highly-placed persons. That the jewels,
of very distinctive design, have never
since been recognised is an even greater
enigma than their disappearance.

“Jurumudi”: A Melbourne University
lecturer had the unusual experience
of serving as a conscript in the’ Austrian
army. In pre-war days he was studying
psychology in Vienna, and a fellow-
student, an Austrian, received his call-up
for three months’ military training. He
expressed to the Australian his horror of.
soldiering and declared he would do-
almost anything to escape it. “It’s the
business of a psychologist to look in at
all doors,” said the Australian. “We’ll
exchange papers. I’ll go into barracks
and you can go to Switzerland and have
some ski-ing.” The trick was not dis-
covered, and the lecturer claims it was the
most enjoyable three months of his life.

“Ceg” recalls an “excursion”:
Passing through Ballarat (Vic.) recently I
was reminded of the “Railway Picnics” whicH
were run to that city over 40 years ago. From
Melbourne and stations up to 100 miles or so
on the other side of Ballarat, special trains
ran once a year to raise funds for a Railway
benefit society. From Melbourne as many as
four specials would be required to take the
crowd, and the fare was about five-bob return
roK-slock
even trucks with awningg over them. I
made the trip once, from Stawell to Ballarat.
The train left about 6 a.m. and the station
was crowded long before that hour. Dad, Mum
and the kids were much in evidence, complete
wkh hampers and all the other paraphernalia
pecu ij ar to the larger families of those days.
in Ballarat the programme included a trip to
Lake Wendouree, where the little paddle-steamers
did a roaring trade. One I recall —the Golden
City was so overloaded that she nearly
swamped, but as the water was only a couple
of feet deep everyone behaved very bravely.
(Stephen Leacock has a similar incident in his
Sunshine Sketches when recounting the sink-
ing of the Mariposa Belle.) After a picnic
lunch in the Botanical Gardens a trek was made
to the City OVal, where band contests and sports
were held, and as day was fading the tired and
weary crowds made for the railway station
and the tedious trip home. If the 75 miles were
“I THOUGHT I didn't recognise that tune!”
covered in four hours it was considered good
going, as the specials gave way to everything
else on wheels. Still, a bottle of beer could be
bought for 6d., so the adults had a cheap
remedy for flagging spirits. The kids were
regaled with lemonade out of those bottles
which had marbles instead of stoppers or
caps. People from the different towns en route
used to sort themselves out into their respective
town groups, and community singing indicated
from what particular town the occupants of
the carriages or trucks came. And so with
“One, two, three, the so-and-so boys are we,”
the various loads were disgorged on to their
home platforms, all agreeing it was a great
five-bobs’ worth.

“Fergus Mac Swab”: Benzedrine (B.
27/10/-48) is the proprietary name for
amphetamine, a colorless liquid with
varied medicinal uses, ranging from
acute catarrhal rhinitis to forms of
tummy-ache. It has been used in treat-
ment of depressive psychoses; in parti-
cular to dispel the depressive psychosis
induced by a hangover. It acts on the
higher nervous centres and is the' most
powerful mental stimulant known ; hence
its attraction for students. R. H. Micks,
however, in his Essentials of Materia
Medica, warns:
Students should note that, though am-
phetamine is sometimes alluded to as the
“confidence drug,” the confidence may be
acquired at the price of diminished accuracy
of memory and reasoning-powers; it is
courting disaster to take it before an ex-
amination....
The most striking effect of the drug is
that it tends to produce insomnia—a
moderate dose of five to 10 mgm., taken
during the afternoon, is likely to cause a
sleepless night. Prolonged use leads to
persistent headache and nervousness.
.Amphetamine is capable of producing a
rise in blood-pressure and disturbances of
the heart’s action, but it does so, usually,
only in doses of from 30 to 40 mgm.
Smaller doses eliminate the sense of
fatigue, and as a rule make the subject
more lively and talkative. There is no
record of a single fatal dose being taken,
but in one case collapse and death was
reported to have followed continuous
administration. Micks concludes:
Any patient taking amphetamine con-
tinuously must be watched carefully for
evidence of ill-effdcts. Amphetamine given
repeatedly is a dangerous drug.

“Repatriate”: Recent Sydney bash-
ings recall an earlier outbreak. A favorite
trick was to ask for a match, and when
one hand went into the pocket to oblige,
the accoster would promptly drop his
would-be benefactor and relieve him of
his wallet. An outsized youth of about
19, warned of the practice and told to hit
first and take no chances, missed the last
train home, and was cooling his heels on
Central Station, waiting for the paper-
train at 4 a.m., when he was accosted by a
chappie with “Got a match on you, Dig?”
He nodded and, putting his hand down as
if to take a box of matches from his
trouser-pocket, uppercut the mendicant,
laid him cold and fled. Next day the
dailies came out with the story that a
“man last night was viciously attacked by
a thug at Central Station. He had no
matches and asked a powerfully-built
man for a light,” and so forth.

“Hypo” on a photographic bias:
Reports that British camera- and lens-makers
are planning to capture the markets previously
held by Germai* concerns, and are prepared
to do business at roughly half pre-war
German prices, brings to mind the fact that
for the last 50 years (despite the events of
1914-18) the principal handicap the British
photographic trade has had to labor under has
been the hypnotic effect exercised on British
consumers by German names. The superstition
has been successfully propagated that only at
Jena can the best optical glass be manufac-
tured ; only in Germany can be found the
skilled workers to construct high-speed minia-
ture and press cameras. Over 40 years ago,
when one of the most successful of British lens-
making concerns was just starting business,
it put on the market an F 4 aperture camera
lens at about a third the price of the best-
advertised German lens of that type. Every-
body said it was a dull lens; negatives from
it lacked the sparkle derived from Jena glass;
it didn’t give good definition all over the field;
it distorted. The makers took their maligned
lens along to the National Physical Labora-
tory which, using full aperture, photographed
two open pages of a small-print Bible on a
quarter-plate and enlarged the result to 16in. x
12in. The enlargement, and others embodying
the result of other searching tests, were
appended to a report stating that for precision
of definition and flatness of field the British
lens knocked any Continental competitor right
out of the ring. Even then the prejudice
against the home-made article lingered in
Britain, and by the time World War II came
along it was thicker than ever.

“Lao-dah”: Most people have heard of
Brahmins angrily throwing food away be-
cause an untouchable’s shadow has fallen
across it, but few may know that the white
man comes under the same religious in-
hibition. An Australian long resident in
India and friendly with both Moslems and
Hindus was invited to dinner at the
house of a wealthy, well-educated Hindu.
A magnificent feed was spread before
him, but his host sat at the head of the
table eating nothing. The Australian
was not a caste man, so his host could
not tJ possibly eat with him or even in the
same room and, despite protests, he
waited until his guest was finished. Sub-
sequently the glasses the Australian had
drunk from and the dishes would be
broken so that there would be no danger
of pollution for the servants.

“Jemac”: With something like 77 p.c.
of its urban population served by public
libraries, Canada recently introduced in
Edmonton a novel idea worth copying
here a children’s “library tram.”
Crammed with books, a standard tram
travels over normal suburban foutes and
the children board it, select their books
and get off a few stops down the road.
Toronto is even better served. In a city
smaller than Sydney there is a central
library, with another for boys and girls
near by. The main concern has 15
branches strategically located about
the city, with, as well, a music and educa-
tional-film library, four hospital libraries
and travelling book-shops providing for
11 homes for the aged. The children’s
library has six branches and administers
23 others in city schools. Librarianship
has become a recognised profession; the
two largest universities now have post-
graduate schools of library science.

“Donnybrook”; There was very good
psychology behind the making of those
money-boxes beloved of “O’Johnno” (B.
3/11/ ’4B), especially the mechanical ones.
An example of “the negro with scarlet
lips who clapped into a capacious mouth
a penny you placed in his hand” was
given years ago to the six-year-old son
of a bank-manager down in the Wes-
tralian timber-belt. Saturday after-
noon came and he disappeared from
home. Search-parties scoured his usual
haunts without success and things were
just reaching the stage where the creeks
and waterholes were to be dragged when
home he came, clutching his nigger-head
money-box full to the teeth with coin of
the realm. He had spent the afternoon
in the corner pub where thirsty timber-
cutters had vied with each other in sup-
plying provender for the “capacious
mouth”—and not only pennies; they
found that shillings and florins worked
just as well. The youngster had come
home to get the box emptied so that he
could keep on with the good work, but
Mrs. 8.-M. shattered his. dreams of
wealth. The town hospital got the benefit
of the collection and old Sambo was re-
tired from further service.
THE FREE-PHYSIC FLOP.
“Since the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act became
qperative in June, only 41 of Australia’s 7000 doctors
have prescribed free medicine in accordance with the
Labor Government’s formulary.”— “S. M. Herald.”
One thing to take a horse to water, brother —
You must have heard that ancient saw, I
think —
A task involving neither fuss nor bother, •
But it’s another business, quite anpther,
Trying to make him drink.
Free physic! Filled with generous emotions,
Chifley and Co. were out to give away
To all who needed them pills, purges, potions
And various other hygienic notions
Gratis, with nix to pay.
What scope for self-approval it afforded!
"’How cheerfully those philanthropic souls
Looked for their thoughtfulness to be rewarded,
Appreciation of their work recorded
By voting at the polls!
They stewed their steed to where the water
beckoned,
Stood him expectantly upon the brink,
Took the first step all right but not the second.
Tbo blindly confident, they never reckoned
f He might refuse to drink.
They found the Galens, spite of all endeavor,
A stern and stubbornly-determined tribe
Who, even to get physic “on the never”
For patients, jibbed at being told whatever

§ 14 months.
This big and expanding organisation—
parent arid a score of subsidiaries —is one
of the major industrial groups in the
Commonwealth. Operations extend
throughout all the Australian States and
New Zealand and north to Singapore
and. cover a wide range of products. The
latter include glass bottles (the line on
which the business grew up) and a variety
of other glass containers, window-glass,
pressed and blown glass, plastics, refrac-
tories, cartons, corkboard and various
engineering products such as fabricated
steel, tools, nuts, bolts, etc.
At end June last total assets of the
group amounted to £11,035,931 as
against £7,751,935 in 1940, when the first
consolidated accounts were published.
The increase of £3,283,996 in eight years
was financed partly from a new issue of
996,941 £1 ords. at premium ofi ss. each
in Sept., 1939, partly from borrowed
funds and partly from surplus earnings.
Fresh projects now in hand include the
manufacture of crockery (a new industry
in Australia), for which deliveries of
plant have commenced ; production of
glazed wall tiles, which will begin shortly
at a new factory at Sydney ; erection, of
new glass-container works at Hobart
(Tas.); and installation of new glpss
furnaces, claimed to be the largest in the
worlfc, at Sydney and Melbourne. The
glass factory at Singapore came into pro-
duction in August last.
The slight contraction (£3441) in net
earnings of the group last term was due
to heavier provision for depreciation, etc.
(£548,294, up £95,713). An unspecified
allowance was also made for “taxation
and contingencies.” Turnover was a
record, though production in the glass-
container and other parts of the under-
taking below plant capacity, owing
to shortages of labor, coal and some raw
materials, notably soda ash. Costs rose
steeply following recurrent wage lifts, in-
troduction of the 40-hour week and in-
creased price of raw materials, etc. The
effect upon net earnings, however, was
offset by the bigger trading, lift in selling
prices and abolition of War-time (Co.)
Tax. The £472,320 of profit claimed —it
covers 13 months in the parent’s ac-
counts —was enough to pay the pref. div.
and show 10.1 p.c. on the £4,486,233 of
ord. capital as against 10.3, 8.6, 8.4, 7.2
and 6.9 p.c. back to 1943. A point was
added to the div., lifting it to 8 p.c. and
making the averagd over the last nine
years 7.8 p.c. The £4,687,687 of visible
lay-by, which benefited by disclosure of
£135,414 of inner reserves and unex-
plained additions, is subject to £2,372,526
of goodwill, etc.
Continued expansion is the outstanding
feature of consolidated balance-sheet
figures:

freeholds, £145,557 to plant, £111,558 to
shareholdings, £473,824 to stocks and
£6621 to debtors’ balances the group
drew upon cash, etc., for £145,302 and
went outside for a further £444,212. The
more-or-less liquid surplus (£3,173,326)
was £2495 stronger, despite the outlay on
fixed assets.
To help reduce the debt, which has
increased substantially since the books
were ruled off, and finance the new under-
takings and expansion of old ones,
448,623 new £1 ords. are to be offered at
an early sate to present ord. holders, one
for 10, at a premium of 295. each—the
premium was fixed by the Capital Issues
Board. When all the money on that lot
is in paid capital will be £5,109,856 in
175,000 9 p.c. cum. prefs. and 4,934,856
ords., and reserves will benefit by
£650,503 of share premiums.
The market, prepared to wait for its
benefits, prices the ords. at 58s. 3d.,
worth 575. Bd. after exercising the rights
and allowing for brokerage. The return
at 575. Bd. is 2.7 p.c. on an '8 p.c. div.
basis. The investor who looks for a
shade over 4 p.c. on his money counts on
a 12 p.c. distribution, which, together
with the pref. div., would call for
£607,932, or 5.8 p.c. on £10,448,046 of
shareholders’ funds (capital and reserves
combined). Last term’s profit was equal
to 5 p.c. op shareholders’ funds at end
June. Provided costs don’t get out of
hand, better might be expected as output
of existing plants approaches nearer to
capacity and , the new enterprises and
equipment get into their stride.

Because the latest profit was won under
exceptional economic conditions, the
board says the 2\ p.c. bonus (first thing
of its kind) sent out with the 10 p.c. div.
should be regarded as “a smile of for-
tune,” and that no assurance of its con-
tinuance can be given. Witf? a twinkle
in its eye the market accepts the caution
and notes the strong, support for capi-
tal, the wide margin between earnings
and distributions, the co.’s satisfactory
history as a dividend-payer—with few
exceptions the ords. have had a regular
10 p.c. since 1906 —and the fact that the
management is alive to the dangers
ahead and likely to have made some pro-
vision to meet them. It therefore prices
the pound ords. at 625. 9d. as against
58s. 3d. a year ago, and 435. 12 months
before that. The return at 625. 9d. is 4
p,c. on a 12£ p.c. distribution, or 3.2 p.c.
on a 10 p.c. basis. The 6 p.c. first prefs.
at 30s. and the 1\ p.c. seconds at 365.
yield 4 p.c. and 4.1 p.c. respectively.
The £276,960 (up £43,645) of profit—
easily the best since David Jones founded
the business 110 years ago—was written
after allowing £64,002 (up £11,435) for
depreciation and whatever was con-
sidered necessary for taxation and other
contingencies. Turnover of the three re-
tail stores —one each at Elizabeth, Mar-
ket and George Streets —exceeded the
£9,000,000 mark. And- five clothing fac-
tories (Surry Hills, Katoomba, Cessnock,
Kurri Kurri and Hargrave Park) and a
shoe-manufacturing subsidiary (Selby and
Co.) enabled wholesale as well as retail
profits to be gathered on nearly one-
fifth of the co.’s wholesale purchases.
The £276,960 covered pref. requirements
and 27 p.c. on the £910,000 of ord. capi-
tal as against 22.5, 22.2, 16.8, 16.3, 16.2,
14.9 and 12.7 p.c. back to 19.41. On
shareholders’ funds (capital and re-
serves combined) the year’s net return
was 10.2 p.c.; on turnover it was a
shade over 6d. in the £.
For over a decade war and post-war
inflationary ‘and other influences have
steadily bumped up the national income,
wages, prices and costs. At the same
time scarcities, rationing and price-con-
trol have taken the edge off competitipn
and reduced the effort needed to turn
goods into cash. Broadly, official policy
has been to maintain gross cash margins.
So, although e gross percentage margins
have narrowed as prices rose, and costs,
aggravated by the 40-hour week and re-
current wage lifts, have gobbled more of
each year’s takings, expanding turnover
has thus far worked the trick so far as
net earnings are concerned. How long
it will continue to do so is doubtful;
sooner or later the inflationary process
works its own cure.
Hence the caution by chairman
Charles Lloyd Jones that “the business
boom is artificial and cannot last.” He
adds a warning that “there is a danger
that a slight recession may be regarded
as the beginning of a general economic
decline. If this thought became general
and caused retailers, merchants and
manufacturers to restrict buying in their
business this outlook would become un-
fortunate for the nation, as it would in
itself produce a depression.” At the
moment there is no evidence of the onset
of a general depression, though there are
welcome signs, here and abroad, that the
boom is approaching, if it has not already
reached, its peak in many lines of con-
sumer goods. Retail turnovers, how-
ever, are still on the up-grade, and so are
wages, prices and costs —last-mentioned
promises to be the most stubborn mem-
ber of the team.
Meanwhile traders are exposed to tlje
possibility of being caught with over-
priced stocks, especially fashion goods.
Hence the importance of provision for
contingencies in this direction and care-
ful buying. Bigger trading and rising
prices sent D.J.’s stocks (in at valuation)
up £360,095 and debtors’ balances (less
reserves) up £241,192 last term:

Pacific Chenille-Craft, Ltd.
First accounts of Pacific Chenille as a
public company show a consolidated net
profit of £64,929 for the year ended June
30. In two respects the figure appears
to be conservatively stated. First, the
£83,387 tax provision includes assess-
ments “on undistributed profits tax of
previous years” when Pacific Chenjlle
was a private company. As a public co.
a normal year’s assessment on the tax-
able income of £148,316 should have
been substantially less.
Secondly, the declared profit doesn’t
include earnings of the subsidiary, Super-
Tex Candle wick Chenille Pty.; although
the subsidiary showed a profit for the
year (amount unstated) the funds were
applied directly in reducing the premiums
paid for its shares by the parent. Super-
Tex has a paid capital of £lO,OOO, and
the net premium of £31,969 now appears
as an intangible asset in the consolidated
accounts.
Beginning in a small way in 1940,
Pacific Chenille found a responsive mar-
ket for its bedspreads, dressing-gowns
and other cotton garments made in the
tufted chenille styles, but civilian work
was soon interrupted by the war. A
quick reconversion, was carried out in
1945-46, and a former munitions annexe,
at Goulburn was taken over to supple-
ment the Alexandria (Sydney) head-
quarters. Other chenille factories are
now operating at Yass and Newcastle,
while the Sydney business of Australian
Towel Weaving Mills —makers of “Aus-
mill” towels —was bought last month at
an unstated price.
The present consolidated balance sheet
is the first of its kind, but directors state
that there was a net addition of £35,822
to fixed assets last term, whilst stocks
rose £127,050, debtors £25,368 and cash
£100,993. These were financed by a capi-
tal issue of 500,000 ss. shares at a
premium of 7s. 6d. each. Net reserves,
including premiums but deducting in-
tangible assets, now stand at £128,290:

' Plant 66,228
Stocks .. .. 259,375
Debtors .. .. .. .. .. 64,674
Cash 221,453
Intangibles .. 41,969
Part of the cash has doubtless been ab-
sorbed since the close of accounts in
acquiring the towel mill and in
setting up a cotton-spinning plant at
Goulburn, designed to make the co. in-
dependent of outside sources for its basic
material.
According to chairman L. P. Keating
results have continued to be very satis-
factory in the first three months of the
current term, and the 40-hour-week pill
has been swallowed without severe cost
problems. The regular demand for
chenille wear in Australia remains to be
seen ; the co. proposes to expand its range
of products, and already has links
through its board of directors with the
wholesale and retail trades.
The new shares issued last term quali-
fied for a two-month dividend at 10 p.c.,
whilst the older capital was paid 20 p.c.
for a full year, including 10 p.c. from
tax-free reserves —only £4699 remains
of these reserves. Altogether, the divi-
dends amounted to £41,333, compared
with the declared profit of £64,929, which
represented 31 p.c. on average capital.
This year a 20 p.c. hand-out on present
capital would call for £56,000.
Pacific Chenille’s ss. shares have been
fairly firm on ’Change since the early
1 quotes around 15s. 9d. in May. Present
price of 17s. offers a yield of 5.9 p.c.
dn the basis of a 20 p.c. dividend ; on
book-values there is tangible cover of
7s. 3d. per share.

A recession in net earnings has been the
common experience of the hotel trade
over the last 12 months. The slip was
more pronounced than the figures in the
table suggest, because earnings for 1947
were charged with War-time (Co.) Tax,
later abolished in respect of that year;
hence the transfer of £2302 from tax
provision to general reserve last term.
Nevertheless, the £10,243 (down £1989)
of profit claimed was a creditable per-
formance. It was 20.4 p.c. on capital as
against 24.4, 23.6, 19.1, 20.5, 19.4, 13.2
and 10 p.c. back to 1941. The figure was
written after providing for contingencies,
including £2500 for depreciation and
something for taxation, and sending £902
to the staff fund. The div. remained at

A host of wholesome foods
Sugar provides energy almost as
soon as it is eaten. That is why
kiddies like sweet things their
appetites naturally want the kind
of food which supplies energy
for their constant playing and
running around.
THE COLONIAL SUGAR REFINING CO. LTD.
10 p.c., and has done so since
1942. Over the last 11 years the
co. has added £47,507 to re-
serves, lifting them £l7BB in ex-
cess of the £50,000 of paid capi-
tal.
Turnover, helped by a small
increase in controlled tariff
charges, was a record. The
trouble was that rises in wage
rates and in prices for provisions
and other commodities, and the
effects of the 40-hour week,
gobbled the gain and more be-
sides. A fashionable residential
hotel, like the Wentworth, works
with its accommodation, furnish-
ings and service. The higher the
the greater the wear
and tear, and therefore the
charge for replacements, now
two-to-three times greater than
pre-war, and still rising. Much,
therefore, depends upon what
has been spent on replacements
and charged to earnings.
Despite the buoyant state of the
national income, employment
and wages, hotel turnover ap-
pears to be near its peak; and
there are limits to savings that
can be "made on the organisa-
tional, or management, side of
the business. So, in the absence
of further increases in tariff and
liquor charges, net earnings are
likely to become more sensitive
to rising costs than of recent
years.
Financially the co. is in a
much stronger position than it
used to be:

Harrietville (Tronoh), Ltd.,
operating in the Ovens Valley
(Vic.), hasn’t met with much
luck to date. Its big 4600-ton
all-electric dredge, equipped
with 20-c.f. buckets and capable
of handling 350,000 c.y. a
month, closed down from end
1942 until May, 1946. For the
year to end June, 1947, it
treated 1,961,300 c.y. for
3182.70 z. smelted gold at a loss
of £28,436. For the year to
June 30 last the machine dug
2,285,650 c.y. for 7296.50 z.
smelted gold and a profit of
£415. That was after spending
£2362 on development and
allowing £9913 for depreciation.
Recoveries increased from
0.74 gr. to 1.53 gr. per c.y.,
and compare favorably with
bore values for the region
wofked. Costs rose from 7.36 d.
to 7.90 d. per c.y., and are still
on the upgrade. It is expected
to dig 3gr. dirt for the next
few years, which means a work-
ing profit of nearly 9d. a yard
on the basis of last term’s costs.
Total area to be treated was
estimated originally to contain
96,000,000 c.y., averaging 1.92 gr.

current assets totalled £24,765,
there was £4996 coming to the
bank, £15,479 to sundry credi-
tors and £221,750 to the London

count. Paid capital is £375,000

The Communist Menace
Australia’s Communists —they
now control the Miners’, Iron-
workers’, Waterside Workers’
and Seamen’s Unions like
their disingenuous Russian
masters, on whom they model
their ideals and shape their con-
duct, are a stonewall obstruct-
ing our national development,
progress and prosperity. At the
moment the main plank in their
platform is dislocation and the
misery and distress that go with
it, as a prelude to social dis-
orders and the seizure of politi-
cal power by revolution. This
much, at least, has been made
plain the world over.
Among other things, the tac-
tics, of which the current coal
trouble is part, are to ignore the
impartial'and overriding super-
vision of public authority in in-
dustrial matters and bring about
dislocation through strikes and
stoppages, forcing the issue as
far as inane government will
allow it to go. And all this at a
time when the leaders of trade
and industry are striving to bring
about expansion by improving
products, procedure and output,
and so cheapen goods, widen
markets and improve the
standard of living.
All but a small, disaffected
fraction of the community look
to both Federal and State Gov-
ernments to protect their future
way of life, livelihood and pros-
perity by taking prompt and
effective action to carve out the
Communist canker in industry
before? it becomes lethal. This
can be done by just enforce-
ment of the existing law, with-
out fear or favor, and by intro-
duction of new democratic
legislation to provide for a com-
pulsory secret ballot in advance,
supervised by the proper elec-
toral authorities, in all union dis-
-putes involving stoppage of
work.
Or is this too much to expect
of “Labor” Governments, in
which trade-unionism is the
power behind the throne and
whose Ministers are, without ex-
ception, a mediocre lot?
Secured Penury
A tract for the times just
issued by the vice-chancellor of
our National University has the
title Back to Earth in Economics
(Angus and Robertson), and it-
self gets high marks for earthi-
ness. After a successful record
of war - time administration
under Governments of all the
political parties, Professor Cop-
land can now view the whole
mechanism in detached perspec-
tive, and so much the more
compelling is his demand that
our planners come down from
their ivory bureaus to reality.
The author himself seems to
appreciate that his booklet is
strongest in diagnosis. Many of
its findings won’t be unfamiliar
to readers of The Bulletin. In
the United States, observes Pro-
fessor Copland, industrial out-
put is about 85 p.c. above pre-
war levels, and in Canada 65
p.c., while in Australia the
figures tell a story of failure.
We are facing defeat because
“good standards of labor” are
vanishing and because of the
lack of basic materials —most
fundamentally of coal. “Aus-
tralia should now be experienc-
ing one of her greatest periods
of capital expansion,” but that
would call for an increase by at
least one-third in our weekly
coal output (based, of course,
on those weeks when there is an
output), and that won’t be
achieved for many years. With
the production of bricks still 20
p.c. less than pre-war and at the
present rate of home-building,
“the housing crisis will become
almost a permanent feature of
the Australian economy: a most
disquieting thought and a des-
perate prospect for large-scale
immigration.”
Naturally, the present abun-
dance of money produced by ab-
normal export prices and high
wages does nothing to veil the
productive failure from Profes-
sor Copland. “It may be old-
fashioned nowadays,” he says,
“to talk of artificial prosperity
—we refer to this as ‘full em-
ployment’—but it is a condi-
tion familiar to students of Aus-
tralian economic history/’
That failure hasn’t merely
prevented Australia from con-
verting its strong export position
into material prosperity, and the
resulting bottlenecks have not
only brought about “a develop-
ing sense of frustration among
both employers and employed,”
but it also means we have
omitted to construct necessary
supports against the day when
export prices fall. The last point,
a very important one, might
have been made more explicit
by Professor Copland. Our pre-
sent productive poverty is at
least being partly compensated
by the high level of imports
which we are able to afford with
the proceeds of our primary in-
dustries. But a relapse in the
terms of trade will tend ,to re-
duce Australia’s importing
capacity and so accentuate the
material (as well as monetary)
penury. Had local manufactur-
ing industries been vigorously
developed in the interim the im-
pact would have been cushioned.
On the question of curatives
at this stage, the author con-
fines his discussion profes-
sionally to financial measures,
but there is no evidence that he
considers any or all of these to
be sufficient by themselves. He
regrets that a stabilisation fund
for all primary exports wasn’t
introduced three years ago to
check inflation, and even now
he appears to favor some volun-
tary adoption of the scheme.
The virtues of big tax-cuts ate
considered “too intricate and
speculative” a question for his
booklet, but he comes out
strongly against any apprecia-
tion of the £A because it would
entail appreciation against dol-
lars as well as sterling, and so
a possible reduction of vital
dollar imports.
The urgent need that Profes-
sor Copland sees for greater im-
ports from America leads him
to repeat at some length his plea
for a large dollar loan—although
in the process he seems to make
out a fairly strong case why
Americans should be chary
about advancing the funds.
(The difficulties about ultimate
repayment he describes as
“primarily an American prob-
lem.”) Import controls generally,
he reminds us, can allow ineffi-
cient industries to develop under
hothouse conditions to an extent
where they will handicap com-
petitive exports.
Stimulating as these financial
arguments are, they will not, as
Professor Copland recognises,
command universal assent, and,
in any case, they don’t add up
to a full prescription. The
book’s main virtues lie in the
authoritative confirmation it
gives of our economic disease
and in its final plea that “an
obsession for security” should
be replaced by “some revival of
the pioneering spirit which has
played so significant a part in
“No bag s, son — I'm travelling light.”
solving problems of production
peculiar to Australia.” Post-
war reconstruction is bogging
because it hasn’t tackled funda-
mentals. If the coal lag had
been mastered at an early stage,
how much more would have
automatically followed, but the
planners have been snipping at
hedge-tops when the roots are
in decay.
North Western General Stores,
Ltd., has been the first to an-
nounce an intention of widening
the ordinary share-register so as
to escape the new punitive tax
rates on private concerns. Chair-
man Orwell Phillips said last
week that a new ord. issue will
probably be made, and a propor-
tion may be reserved for exist-
ing pref. holders. This co. was
registered in N. S. Wales six
months ago to take over 1 the
country-store businesses of A. C.
Reid and Co. (Moree); A. E.
Collins Pty. (Narrabri, Wee
Waa, Bellata and Burren June-
tion); John Foley Pty. (Emma-
ville) and Sylvester Butler Pty.
(Mungindi). The businesses
still operate in their own names,
and North Western is a holding
concern whose assets are practi-
cally confined to shares in the
subsidiaries (£165,000) and ad-
vances to them (£71,118). Hawke
and Treloar Pty. (of Gunnedah
and Curlewis) have lately joined
the team, making the number
c f stores 11, and Mr. Phillips
has spoken of further expansion,

About Town
Lovers of London everywhere
will be glad to know that one
well-remembered landmark —the
shot-tower on the south bank
of the Thames—is not to be dis-
turbed in the clearance work
now begun in preparation for
the exhibition that is to be part
of the 1951 Festival of Britain.
The tower is still used for the
manufacture of shot for sport-
ing guns, for which purpose it
was built in 1789. Molten lead
is released at a height of 140 ft.,
and in falling cools into glo-
bules of just the right size. In
a complex age the process seems
refreshingly simple.
The site chosen for the exhi-
bition is the area between
Waterloo Bridge, the County
Hall, York-road and the river.
Hitler’s bombs are responsible
for the bulk of the demolition ;
the rest will soon be completed
by small contractors. The new
river-wall is to extend about
110 ft. into the Thames and will
reclaim about acres. Cost,
something over £2,000,000, will
include the bill for a permanent
concert-hall. Londoners will re-
joice at the passing of an un-
usually dreary area.
Trafalgar Day fittingly saw the
Square emerge from the metal
shroud which for weeks had in-
trigued passers-by. Towering
Nelson now has companions of
more natural kith than Land-
seer’s lions. The busts of Jelli-
coe and Beatty which were
planned as long ago as 1936 are
unveiled and look south from
the wall in front of the National
Gallery. .New and higher life
has been given to the fountains ;
autumn’s first cold sting has not
deprived us of flower-beds and
evergreen shrubs; and the
flood-lighting gives color and
gaiety to the night scene.
Perhaps the presence of the
Beatty statue will enhance the
Nelson touch. To ex-naval pien
the absence of a cap is an un-
happy omission. A little jaunty
confidence would certainly help
us along.
Entente Russe
Whatever may be the outcome
of the Horner incident, one hard
fact stands out clear: it was top
priority in Communist strategy
that sent him to France at the
crucial time not as Comrade
Horner but as general secretary
of the National Union of Mine-
workers of Great Britain. What
happened? He went to Paris as
fraternal delegate to the French
C.G.T. After he had arrived
the French miners came out on
strike. His Welsh and Scottish
comrades affirmed their support.
All these acts were Communist- ,
inspired. Horner declared that
the entire body of British mine-
workers gave their support. He
was then called to order by his
president, Will Lawther, who is
not a Communist.
Horner’s excursion into in-
ternational politics has cleared
the air. Known to the public
only as a miners’ leader who
happened also to be a Com-
munist, he is now plainly seen
in his true colors —as a Com-
munist first and all the time. An
able organiser, he has won the
confidence of the miners ; and
by doing so, the praise of his
King-street headquarters. He
has not been sparing of compli-
ments ; every miner, he told
them, was worth £lOOO a year;
after payment of expenses the
miners should share all the
profits among themselves ; and
many other cupboard love-songs
in the same key.
The Mask Off
To demonstrate that his pri-
vate politics were independent
of his official position, Horner
advised the Wigan miners at the
recent by-election to vote for the
Labor candidate and not for the
Communist. The Moscow stooge
was low in the poll, but Horner
retained the confidence of the
miners and, no doubt, the praise
of the party. As a Communist
he is against the Marshall Plan,
but as a miners’ friend he en-
courages production. He has,
in fact, fooled the miners and
the not fully-informed country
for almost all of the time.
Has he now gone too far? He
implies that he doesn’t care, as
“international working-class soli-
darity” is more important than
his job. Perhaps he is satisfied
that he has made full use of his
key position in the Communist
scheme of things and that there
are greater tasks and responsi-
bilities in front of him. In the
meantime, many people who
lack the feather-bed protection
of trade-unions and who have to
struggle fairly hard for their
living are asking each other
“Who are these ‘working’ classes
we hear so much about?”
At least they have now
learned that Mr. Horner,
conscientious miners’ leader, is
a foundation member of the
Communist party of Great
Britain, in the service of which
party he has spent exactly one-
half of his 54 years ; that he has
paid five visits to Russia; that
he has served four prison sen-
tences ; and that he fled the
country at the beginning of
World War I to join the Irish
Citizen Army. At the time of
the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact he
lay low.
It remains to be seen whether,
and how soon, effective action
against Communist influence
within the trade-unions will fol-
low the understanding of it.
Cruft’s Dog Show
It may be that the constric-
tions of our difficult times force
people to seek their pleasure and
interest nearer home, but there
seems to be no en&to the setting-
up of new records. Attendance
figures at the Tests, the Olympic
Games, Soccer matches and
almost every big event seem to
outnumber the previous ones
with inevitable regularity.
Cruft’s, absent from the London
scene for nine years, has reap-
peared in a new setting—the
vasty hall of Olympia—for a
record turn-up during the two
days of the show.
Britain’s dog population is
estimated to have regained the
3,000,000 mark, notwithstanding
a war-time drop of 500,000
through feeding difficulties. The
Kennel Club register of pedigree
pups is twice its pre-war length.
In the show the most popular
breeds were Cocker Spaniels
(263 exhibits) and Alsatians (195
exhibits). Cockers are, in fact,
established all-rounders in popu-
larity ; they head the list of the
66 well-known breeds whose ex-
port brings in considerable sums
in dollars.
One dog that attracted much
attention is the only one of its
kind in England. Two British
soldiers brought this Leonburger,
a huge but benign creature
rather like a hound, from
Italy. Its owner, unable to feed
it, was glad to exchange it for a
supply of soap. Few blood-
hounds were on show ; because
of lack of food —even a pup
needs 31b. of meat a day—this
famous breed is in danger of
becoming as extinct as much of
the fiction that at one time was
so greatly in its debt.
To those not overfussy
about the kind of doggy
company they keep; many of the
smaller exhibits had an ap-
parent showgirl sophistication
that suggested the unreal and
even the absurd. Especially was
this so of the Peke which lay
pouting on a blue-and-pink
coverlet, disdainfully ignoring
the toy which dangled from its
basket.

OF PEN PERFECTION
SUNDRY SHOWS
NAMATJIRA.
There is no doubt that Albert
Namatjira, the Arunta tribes-
man, is a remarkable individual
by any standards. At 46, hav-
ing seen but two towns in his life
—Alice Springs and Oodnadatta
—and having had no more edu-
cation than is afforded by the
Australian education system
third-grade, he is an inter-
national figure. He has held
half a dozen exhibitions in the
capital cities of the country
which have all sold out, has sold
several thousands of pounds’
worth of pictures, has had
brochures, a book, films and
scores of essays written about
him by eminent critics, and has
had State Governors open his
shows.
Namatjira has two houses
which he never uses, contem-
plates buying a cattle-station, has
two grown-up sons who are also
painters, a committee to manage
his impressive finances and
keeps upwards of* 300 of his
poor relations and tribal cob-
bers who, in accordance with
the simple fashion of the
Centre, cash-in on. his largesse
and regularly empty his pocket
and his larder after every exhi-
bition.
Moreover, the artist has been
the inspiration for a large school
of abo. painters who paint like
him or like Van Gogh, Gauguin,
Cezanne or Dali without ever
having heard of them or even
seen their pictures. Yet, with
all that, Albert remains the un-
sophisticated native and, artisti-
cally, stays completely focused
on his painting, and whenever his
army of dependants runs short
of snake and damper he goes off
into the desert to paint another
100 meticulously-executed land-
scapes. Damper, in fact, is his
only trouble. Imagining it was
white man’s food and having the
enormous appetite of the
Arunta, he was eating so much
of it that he had almost attained
to the bulk of Haydn when Rex
Battarbee, his mentor, advised
him to adopt a more balanced
diet. He promptly went back to
the more sensible native menu.
His latest exhibition, at
Melb. Athenaeum, sold out for
£ISOO. It is much like his last
one. There are the ghost gums,
the blue ranges, the pink and
purple desert, the fantastic rock
shapes, painted with the same'
careful attention to detail. In
“Watering Place, Tent Hill” and
in “After the Wet,” a strikingly
damp sketch of a water-puddle,
he shows the penetration of the
genuine artist.
"Carmen."
One can’t help feeling a mea-
sure of sympathy for these poor
opera singers. If they take no
notice of the audience’s applause
the audience resents it. If they
do take notice of it they are
laughed at. When Don Fran-
cesco Battaglia Jose, corporal of
dragoons in Seville, buried his
sad, self-pitying face in the in-
different lap of Dora Minarchi
Carmen at the first performance
of Bizet’s opera at Melbourne
His Majesty’s, thunders of ap-
plause inspired by his singing
of the “Flower Song” rolled
across the theatre. After a few
moments of, no doubt, agonised
reflection he scrambled to his
feet, made a bow and then re-
sumed his former posture, while
gales of laughter swept the audi-
torium.
The poor fellow must have felt
awful. He must have felt just as
terrible the second evening when
he contented himself with lifting
his head and giving his adorers
a brief nod which didn’t fail to
raise titters. How could even
the most conscientious tenor
be expected to keep his mind
on his assumed emotions in
circumstances like those? Mr.
Battaglia wasn’t a bad Don
Jose, however, and his broad
smile was an asset.
The rest weren’t up to the
general standard of the season.
Dora Minarchi’s smoky voice—
When it was on the note —and
her air of sulky passion weren’t
unattractive, but the Escamillo
of Ferdinand© li Donni needed
a few more inches round the
chest and a bit more bombast.
Rina Mariosa was a ray of light
in the smugglers’ stronghold, but
the proceedings in front of the
tobacco factory lacked ginger.
The final bout between Car-
men and her lover was magnifi-
cent. It compensated the house
for missing the bovine coup de
grace in the bullring. Bizet died
a disappointed man after
the first reception of his opera
in Paris. The Parisians, good-
ness knows why, thought it was
too Wagnerian. There is no re-
semblance between Wagner’s
magnificent symphonic dramas
and Bizet’s bagful of tunes,
melodies, choruses and lyrics,
but apparently the Parisians
thought there was and booed it.
Nowadays they flock to see it.
"The Little Foxes."
If the Mosman Theatre
Guild’s performance of “The
Little Foxes” at Mosman Town
Hall reached no great dramatic
heights, neither did it fall to
any depths—it was a competent,
unhurried and consistently enter-
taining performance and that,
after all, is the final criterion.
Marjorie Brewer’s Regina was
appropriately cold and imperi-
ous, although, on one of two
occasions, she was too cold, too
devoid of emotions, so that the
figure became unhuman instead
of inhuman. It was a matter of
slight importance during the play,
but it counted in the final scene
when Regina, having murdered
her husband and swindled her
two brothers, turns to her
daughter for companionship
only to find that that young lady
thoroughly detests her. The fear
and loneliness she is then sup-
posed to register didn’t seem par-
ticularly credible in a figure as
coldly emotionless as Miss
Brewer’s Regina.
Still, the last scene is a diffi-
cult one, hanging as it does on
one line—sometimes it seems
that it would have been better
to have finished the play on
Ben Hubbard’s exit. He, at
least, is a major character,
powerful, jovial and menacing,
and there is more promise of
hell-to-come in his last words
than in the daughter’s “Are you
afraid, Mother?” or words to
that effect. Richard Ashley
made a good Ben of just the
right strength and right humor
and human enough to be a
credible piece of villainy.
As the weak and wicked
Oscar, Edwin Fraser indulged
in too many facial histrionics,
but, at least, there was no mis-
taking his intentions. Allan
Gifford’s Horace Giddens was a
good solid stretch of acting;
Dorothy Walker’s Birdie was as
lost and beaten as she should
be, and Lorna Orchard, as
Regina’s daughter, was suitably
bewildered and forlorn in the
storm of villainy and scheming
hatreds around her.
The production, by Maurice
Francis, will be presented again
tonight and on November 17
and 24.
"Mine Own
Executioner."
This film, at Melbourne
Lyceum, is an excellent version of
Michael Balchin’s novel, better
that the book in certain aspects,
and in a different class from the
“psychological” pseudos.
There is a wide difference
between the alleged “psycho-
logical” film which fits a
story into somebody else’s
theory and this one, which de-
scribes the actual experience of
the writer. The young airman
who becomes a schizophrenic
after being tortured in a Jap
camp in Burma and gets his wife
confused with a sentry he
brained in escaping rings true.
He is the victim of some early
association, and all his war ex-
perience did was to act as a
catalyser; the Jap sentry he
killed is only the excuse for his
strangling of his wife, whom he
obviously worshipped.
The psychiatrist’s problem is to
adjust him back to society by
dealing with his associations, but
it is a race against time as he
is living with his wife and there
is no way in which they can be
separated. There is a living
quality about the film which is
unusual, but a better actor could
have been selected for the role
of the psychiatrist than Burgess
Meredith.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Chief event of Cup-week festivities
was the late-afternoon party given at
Government House by Sir Winston and
Lady Dugan. The white-and-Chinese-
blue-printed silk frock worn by the
Governor’s lady was fashioned with a
draped skirt and deep square neckline,
with revers' falling softly at each side ;
diamond clips highlighted the neckline.
Lady Norrie, wife of the Governor of
S.A., combined sage-green-and-white-
printed frock, black coat and rose-
trimmed black hat. Lady Binney's
Wedgwood-blue suit had trimmings of
mole-fur on revers and pockets ; match-
ing blue embellished her black hat. Mrs.
J. S. Disney added a beret to her smart
black ensemble. English visitor Mrs.
Trestrail-Morton had an unusual touch
to her black ripple georgette frock: the
skirt was shirred from waist to hem;
her shallow coolie ballibuntal straw hat
was untrimmed. Mrs. Allan Walters
wore with her black moire taffeta cock-
tail frock a wide-brimmed Leghorn hat
trimmed with black veiling.
A warm day for the Oaks gave race-
goers opportunity to wear some spec-
tacular summer fashions. Hats were
again the focal point and were worn
with frocks of every material from silk
and chiffon to taffetas and linen. Lady
Dugan’s hat' was fashioned of layers of
midnight-blue tulle and worn with a
patterned silk frock in matching blue and
white in a feathery design. Mrs. Lionel
Newton’s green-and-white-striped faille
dress had a bodice featuring a low neck ;
the skirt pleated in front. Her outsize
white-felt coolie hat was trimmed with
a broad green riband. Mrs. Ronnie
Nott’s frock in pink-and-white candy
stripes gained contrast by a large natural-
straw coolie hat trimmed with black
tulle. Among the wearers of grey en-
sembles were Mrs. W. H. McKechnie
(hers of crepe banded at the hem with
coffee-toned lace, was worn with a
bolero) and Mrs. Noel Dickson, whose
dove-grey faille was caught at the waist
with a black patent-leather belt.
Mrs. E. Lee Steere, a Perth visitor,
topped a jacket-suit of lime-green linen
with a natural-straw boater wreathed with
field flowers. Championing the picture-
hat with the sidewise tilt were Mrs. John
Quere, hers of pinky-grey rough straw
carrying large pastel-pink roses, and Mrs.
James Buchanan, hers also in pinky-grey
tones. Mrs. Fred Dennett’s full-skirted
navy faille frock had a deep neckline
filled in with white lace and organdie;
blue-and-white-spotted veiling swathed
her tiny burnt-straw rose-trimmed hat.
Mrs. A. G. Hunter, in a red-and-white
silk-patterned frock and a white-straw
hat, watched her filly, Blessing, run into
a place in the Oaks Stakes. Mrs. Edmund
Alcock’s large picture hat, swathed with
navy tulle, was worn with a navy moire
taffeta coat; Mrs. A. G. Silk’s suit was
of natural-linen, her flat beret of navy-
blue-and-white straw trimmed with
cerise ribbon.
The marquee set up in the grounds of
Mrs. Lionel Newton’s Toorak home, and
in which luncheon was served to about
100 of her friends, was a mass of rhodo-
dendrons, tulips and white lilac. The
hostess, whose model navy redingote,
showing an underdress of pink-and-white
candy-striped taffeta, was worn with a
small navy-and-white hat, was assisted
by daughter Verna (Mrs. John Linson,
of Geelong), whose printed silk frock
in cyclamen, yellow and pastel-pink had
an all-over design of post-marked enve-
lopes. Inter-State visitors included Mrs.
Wyndham Hill-Smith, of Adelaide, who
was with her mother, Mrs. Stella Lane;
Mesdames Herbert Douglas, M. Hagan
and J. McDonald, all of Sydney. Two
mother-and-daughter combinations at the
luncheon were Mrs. T. G. Jones and
Betty, and Mrs. E. Shilliday and Wanda.
Menzies’ banqueting room was massed
with pink, white and red rhododendrons
and deep-red roses for the racing festival
luncheon which Mrs. Hylton Dale gave
for her friends. The party also served
to welcome home Mrs. H. E. Thonemann,
who recently returned from overseas,
and to farewell Mrs. T. C. Dewez, who
will leave for England early next year
for the marriage of her daughter Yvonne
with Wing-Com. E. Whiteley, R.A.F., in
London. Mrs. Hylton Dale received her
guests in an ankle-length black Chantilly-
lace frock and a tulle-swathed small
black-straw hat. Mrs. Sam Wells com-
bined greige wool frock, matching jacket
and high-crowned, black-straw hat. The
printed-silk frock was the joint favorite
of Mrs. D. Stewart and Mrs. Lindsey
Mildred. Mrs. James MacDougall high-
lighted her, small black hat with pink
black-spotted veiling and wore it with
a black crepe frock, Mrs. Peter Thron-
son’s jacket-suit was of navy taffeta, her
hat a mixture of navy straw and taffeta.
Rural decorations, which included a
harvest-field, were featured at the Ameri-
can Thanksgiving Ball at St. Kilda Town
Hall. Farmer Smith drove his hay-cart
filled with sheaves of wheat across the
stage. On the official table,, turkeys drew
pumpkin carriages, while on the other
tables cabbages were used to hold small
Australian and American flags. A pop-
corn cart did brisk business and tradi-
tional Thanksgiving turkey and pumpkin-
pie were served at supper. Seven hun-
dred dancers took the floor. In the
official party were Consul-General for
the U.S., Samuel J. Fletcher, and Mrs.
Fletcher, she gowned in white crepe;
and R. G. Casey, who is president of the
Australian-American Association, and
Mrs. Casey, the latter wearing a slim-
fitting white-and-green-patterned satin
gown. Rear-Admiral Collins danced with
his wife, whose filmy gown was of grey
tulle. Wife of the president of the
American Ex-Servicemen’s Association
(which organised the ball), Mrs. A. Carl-
son, allied black-and-white check taffeta
with white taffeta. Rhoda Taylor wore
an Empire gown of flame georgette. Mrs.
John Haysom was attractive in aqua-
green silk jersey ; the bodice swathed, the
skirt very full.
Though still a young student, Justine
Rettick will appear as Hansel in the
National Theatre’s presentation of
“Hansel and Gretel” during the season
of opera to be presented in November
at the Princess Theatre; she will also
sing roles in “The Flying Dutchman”
and “The Bartered Bride.” Justine, who
is a pupil of Madame Florence Austral,
has also been soloist with the Brighton
and Camberwell Philharmonic Choirs
during the past year. Photo, by Ronald
Esler.
Once again Mrs. Wallace Mitchell and
her band of willing workers have shown
how they can raise money for charity—
this time to the tune of £l2OO. Function
was a gala matinee at His Majesty’s,
when, with the assistance of the Taits,
scenes from various operas were pre-
sented; the one most enthusiastically re-
ceived was the opening scene from
“Butterfly.” With the Lord Mayor, Cr.
J. S. Disney, was his wife, whose attrac-
tive black frock was worn with a hip-
length jacket, the lapels and short cuffs
of which were faced with ice-blue; her
large coolie-type black-straw hat was un-
adorned. In the official party was Lady
Wales, whose navy-and-white-diamond-
check frock was worn with a navy jacket
faced with the material making the frock
and with a wine-toned straw hat. Lady
Angliss, president of the women’s com-
mittee of U.N.A.C., wore a small, black,
rose-trimmed hat with her lime-green
tailored coat. Mrs. E. Lampe, wife of
the chairman of U.N.A.C., was smartly
attired in black. Stalls in the foyer under
Mrs. C. Curtain’s direction raised over
£4O. Mrs. Frank Tait, whose blue-
crepe dress was overprinted in black,
wore a small black hat trimmed with
pink roses.
Mrs. E. C. Wackett, president of
the Air Force Women’s Association,
gave a luncheon party at Menzies’
for all those who helped in the Battle for
Britain Ball, from which £4OO was raised
for the scholarship fund for the children
of deceased airmen. Mrs. Wackett wore
a soft-blue Angora jacket embroidered in
black to match her black skirt; her large
black hat was edged with black velvet.
A reseda-green wool suit and an oyster-
grey straw hat trimmed with London-
tan ribbon were the choice of Mrs. A. L.
Walters, chairman of the ball committee.
Mrs. Freddy Scherger’s jacket-suit was of
apple-green boucle linen. Mrs. Ned Hol-
land was smart in a white-wool tailored
coat.
From Sydney
The Consul for Norway and Mrs.
H. J. Hofgaard were among the many
giving Cup Day parties. Theirs, how-
ever, was timed for five-thirty onwards,
and was more Consular than Cup. The
reception was in the Pickwick Club, and
the hostess wore a silk crepe frock, the
shade of a ripe apricot. It was long and
of a graceful fullness. 'Her flowers were
orchids. The Minister of Norway and
Mrs. Jorstad came early. Her late-
afternoon frock of turquoise-blue and
her black hat were admired. The hat
had its brim upswept above the forehead,
and flat against the upsweep were two
black wings.
Captain Gunnar Tveten of the
Svalbard, just arrived in Sydney with 900
displaced persons from Europe, told of
scenes and arias from “Tosca” and
“Butterfly” sung on deck by opera singers
—no scores available, of course; the
music was written from memory by other
migrants. There was a ballet dancer,
too, making the journey to this.unknown
land, who never failed to practise every
day.
The captain’s wife and Dr. Aagot
Wendt, one of the ship’s doctors, were
surrounded all the time. France’s Consul-
General De la Croix and Mrs. De la
Croix were there, and Greece’s popular
Vrisakis couple. Among the smart
were Norwegian Consulate’s Daniela
Danielsen, Mrs. Claude Plowman, Mrs.
Roper, Mrs. Knowlton Hicks, Mrs.
Croft, wife of Canada’s Trade Commis-
sioner, Mrs. C. R. McKerihan, Mrs.
Niels Storaker, the wife of Admiral
Moore, Mrs. Orsen Nielsen. Noted well
Mrs. Peter Koch’s white chip straw hat
worn with black-and-white-printed silks.
She talked about the visit to Sydney
(about Christmas-time) of Prince Axel
of Denmark. Described the Prince as
possessing the most charming manner.
Looked forward to with great delight
by the Minister of Norway and Mrs.
Jorstad the early arrival of the latter’s
granddaughter Gerd Elise Nortensen.*
The young traveller is now on her way
from Norway. She will go to Sydney
University to finish her course in
psychology.
Castle reagh-street, just outside the
Royal, is effervescent with youth at five-
fifteen every evening when there is pre-
sentation of Maeterlinck’s “Blue Bird.”
In fact, if the whole street went sailing
off, pedestrians and all, on a pair of
glittering wings, it wouldn’t be surpris-
ing. However, all the dream stuff is in-
side the theatre, where Heather Gell’s
adaptation of the classic is being pre-
sented. Miss Gell (herewith) has a genius
for handling numbers of children —there
are 150 in this cast from six upwards.
Off-stage work of the producer took in
dyeing of 200 milanese vests for the
“butterflies,” and giving a hand with the
making of the costumes. A performance
tomorrow and one on Friday afternoon
will round-off the season. Photo, by
Colin Ballantyne.
Max Murray and wife Maisie Grieg
were the guests of the Australian Book
Society last Wednesday. Maisie, with
over 100 books notched on her totem, is
small, very blonde, very blue-eyed and is
terribly proud of being over a 1,000,000-
a-book seller in U.S. Kathleen Norris
and Faith Baldwin are two others (there
are about five women altogether) who
have achieved this glittering silvery
mountain of publishers’ royalties. Max,
of course, made his big dent on U.S.
editors with his Voice of the Corpse, a
thriller of all the best ingredients mixed
with a master hand. This Letter followed
it, gasping, issue by issue in the Satur-
day Evening Post.”
Maisie believes that a writer, in the
act of making a book, should have
frequent contact with the world she lives
in. Max said for his own part he be-
lieved in keeping away from editors, be-
cause after they met the writer, his halo
seemed to go a bit blurred. But if all
Maisie’s editors were men, and all Max’s
were women, the Murray menage would
never have a reject pushed through the
mail-box. They were a bright pair of
guests, and the fun they brought with
them zipped through the room. Dr.
George Mackaness, who was the day’s
chairman, was like some clever Blondin,
his balancing-rod weighted equally in
favor of romance (Mrs. Murray’s speci-
ality) and mystery, which is her
husband’s. Publisher Collins’s Mr. Price,
just returned from a world tour, made
speech of thanks.
The Feminist Club was packed with
listeners. Everybody . was congratu-
lating Nourma Handford on her just-,
published Cottontrees, a book for teen-
agers and upwards. The 8.8.C.’s arm-
chair detective Dudley was a newcomer
to the lunches; so was John Amory, a
young American ex-serviceman, now one
of the Sydney Ure Smith firm. Bettina
Foa was a young attraction. Her
mother was one-time Sydney newspaper-
woman Isabel Ramsay. Secretary Mrs.
Ernst, writer Gladys Lister (another of
her children’s books is due from the
printer), Gwen Spencer and Stuart Gurr
were part of the pleasant company.
Cup Day in Sydney is as inspiriting as
a pot of tea with the tea-leaves left out.,
Women determined to be gay dolled up
and went out to lunches which merged
into Cup Day afternoons. They played
bridge and snatched off time to listen to
the results from Flemington. Hundreds
of women awaited the great moment in
clubs that ringed the city from Rose Bay
to Elanora, with the R.S.Y.S. and the
Pickwick in between. Those who had
drawn Rimfire in the sweeps felt as
though there wasn’t so much wrong with
the world after all. The tired business-
man who hadn’t managed to get down
south relaxed from the strain of the day
and sneaked off to his club to be one
of the first with the headline news. City-
shoppers heard the broadcasts from loud-
speakers blaring above the city’s din.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite says it's
miraculous how many of her friends had
the tip for Rimfire passed on to them
“just in time.” Of all the people she
knows she is the only one who didn’t win
a sou on the meeting.
Roland Foster, of the Conservatorium,
one of this city’s leading teachers of sing-
ing, has just heard from Collins, the
London publishers, that his book will be
in print about February. He calls it
Come, Listen to My Song, and describes
it as reminiscences, musical and anecdotal,
of two worlds and two eras. It covers
50 years of personal experiences. It tells
of the writer’s friendship and meeting
with many world celebrities, for before
he settled in Sydney Roland was a concert
artist and had toured England and U.S.
several times. He came first to this coun-
try with Clara Butt and her husband,
Kennedy Rumford. Some of the most
delightful chapters in the book tell of
the unfailing charm and kindness of this
couple. Adelina Patti and Melba, Caruso
and John MacCormick and suchlike
Olympians of song come into this saga.
An echo of Tsarist Russia breathed
through Sydney recently, when Michael
Kartzoff, only son of H.S.H. the
Princess Elisabeth of Sayn Wittgen-
stein of Capri, Italy, and of the late
Lt.-General E. de Kartzoff, and Rona
Taylor, daughter of Henry Taylor, of
Newcastle, were married. The bride was
given away by Prince Michael, of the
Russian Imperial family. There was a
dinner-party at Gleneagles in celebration.
Bridegroom was a sergeant in the 2/2nd
M.G. Battalion during the war.
Gertrude Johnson came up from Mel-
bourne last week to preach the gospel of
a National Theatre. She and co-enthu-
siasts have made quite a success of the
idea down south, and emerged from their
all-Australian opera reason trailing clouds
of glory. The Arts Council of Australia
coo-eed the musical, the dramatic and
the ballet-minded to the tenth floor of the
Rural Bank to meet Gertrude last Friday.
And who do you think was one of the
first at the party? Mrs. C. R. Mc-
Kerihan, of course. She was keeping an
eye on her husband’s bank. Naturally
she didn’t want it snatched away and
turned into a glittering theatre overnight.
And really there was such an avid glitter
in the eyes of one and all at the very
mention of a real national theatre that
anything might have happened.
The general idea seems to be that each
State goes ahead building up its own
opera and theatre groups, getting sub-
scribers to the movement, as they have
done in Melbourne. Dorothy Helmrich
greeted the guests, looking very trig in
black. Gertrude’s late-afternoon frock
was a rich gobelin-blue. Conductor
Joseph Post and his wife came, and he
made a speech filling in some of the detail
of the Melbourne opera adventure. A
very effective grey outfit —suit and beret
—was worn by Mrs. McKerihan. Public
Librarian Metcalfe and Mrs. Metcalfe
were seated in a row of “drama, one
neighbor being English playwright
Geoffrey Thomas. Knight Robert Gar-
ran looked in from Canberra,

THE SERVICE MAN
A LEGION RETURNS
From “EK DUM” in Japan
It is autumn in Japan. The
rice has turned golden in a
bumper crop which chokes the
fields from end to end of the
country. The ripe persimmons
hang in clusters over the vil-
lage streets. There is a nip in
the air, and the pines and the
clean, white granite hills of the
south take on a sharper outline.
Winter is coming, and not alone
for Japan ; for the time of lean-
ness is plainly here not only for
that lovely country but for some
of its conquerors.
The British Commonwealth
occupation is also in its autumn;
and the legions are going home.
“Operation Opulence” is nearly
at an end, and soon there will be
but one Australian battalion and
R.A.A.F. squadron and base left
in Nippon to enjoy the delights
which, to a. great part of the
force and especially to its wives,
will have become merely an un-
believably beautiful dream,
topped off with cocktail head-
aches and the wails of bereft
colonels and privates torn
from an atmosphere in which
they were sahibs, to be plunged
once more in the drab and sordid
round of Australian military
duty.
The British, Indians and
Maorilanders, save for stray sur-
vivors, already have gone.
In Northcott’s Day
It was not always sheer de-
light, of course, to be, a member
of the Japan force. The airmen
who came in 1945 and the
pioneers of the 66th Battalion
W,ho came in the first months
of 1946 had a hard time. They
came into an area which had
been bombed to bits, in which
lay Hiroshima, in which whole
miles of the cities were still
charred and empty of buildings,
in which the crops were dis-
organised and meagre, in which
a young man among the natives
was rare, since the prisoners-of-
war had not returned.
There were few facilities for
conquerors. There was hostility
still on both sides. There were
no gift-shops. There was little
shipping. And there had just
passed, to cap the misfortunes
of the inhabitants, the father of
all typhoons.
Finally, the whole land when
occupied was one arsenal.
The Australian rabbit, even if he
were magnified a thousand times
in size and fitted with steel feet,
would be a child at the game of
digging compared with the
Japanese.
Every granite hillside round
the sound of Kure—it is on
the scale of 20-to-one against
Sydney Harbor —and, indeed,
round all the harbors of the In-
land Sea is spaced with tunnel
mouths leading to vast caves. In
these caves were factories,
caches of explosives, guns, arma-
ment in general mostly highly
sensitive to the touch. The
back country was little better.
Even the lovely Kintai Valley
behind Iwakuni held a huge air-
craft factory completely buried
under an innocent-looking, pine-
clad hill, its only manifestation
from the public road being a
door in a rock.
Along the foreshores at Kure
were three of the biggest graving-
docks on earth, side by side,
one equipped for building the
world’s larg e s. t battleship,
Yamato, 69,000 tons, carrying
nine 18in. guns, now on the sea-
bottom off Kyushu. Beside them
vast gantries, huge smelting and
shipbuilding works, gunfound-
ing shops—an immense aggrega-
tion, employing 113,000 workers,
capable of building ships from
ore to launching and arming
them with the world’s largest
weapons. And this, mile upon
mile of it, looked as if a few
atom-bombs had exploded in
a shop full of giants’ meccano-
sets —it was turned into a
tangled ruin, flanked by a
wrecked fleet, which included
three battleships, only in July,
1945, a month before the armis-
tice.
All this mess had to* be
cleaned up over 20,000 square
miles in a land where teeming
inhabitants were hostile and
where conqueror found it diffi-
cult to speak to the conquered.
In all, 75,000 tons of ammuni-
tion was disposed of, plus a huge
booty which included such items
as 203 complete midget sub-
marines, 75 unfinished sub-
marines and 534 gun-barrels
from 6in. to 16in. And 700,000
returning Jap prisoners were
channelled through the 8.C.0.F.
area.
Often the victors, fresh from
Tarakan and Labuan, slept
hard. Frequently they went
hungry or lived unsatisfactorily.
The formative days were
General Northcott’s days, and,
with their usual habit of believ-
ing that all commanders are
omnipotent in matters of their
well-being, the soldiery are apt
to award him the blame for dis-
comfort. Sober reflection, how-
ever, makes it clear that he did a
fine job amid all the muddle and
misery, with his own battalions
newly integrated and not
properly rounded off, with
Indians and British troops all
displaying their national pride
and sometimes curious charac-
teristics and with policy, routine
and supplies not yet properly
organised and in the hands of
men —harried from afar by poli-
ticians whose nerves and
temper were stretched to the
uttermost by four years of war
in tropical countries.
At the peak there were 40,000
men or so in 8.C.0.F. under the
command of an Australian Com-
mander-in-Chief, and that was
at the height of the organisation
and delousing period. Nobody
would care to go back to those
days in Japan.
The bulk of the real work of
the force was finished by March,
1947.
It was after that that the con-
solidation began which cynics
now call Operation Opulence
and the mother of which was
the sacred word “procurement.”
Procurement
Procurement is the means by
which everything is obtained by
the victors in Japan. “Sesame”
never had a more potent mean-
ing or was more simple in opera-
tion. With “sesame” it was
necessary, according to the
book, to rub the door before it
opened upon the treasure be-
yond. But when the word “pro-
curement” is uttered the door
swings open on oiled wheels
without a touch.
Are barracks needed? “Pro-
cure them!” shouts the Allied
Command, and, with a low bow,
Japan produces laborers and
puts them up in fine style as if
they were meant to house a
legion for ever. Does somebody
need a house? It is procured
or built at Japanese expense.
Among the procurements and
buildings have been house
accommodation for 608 families,
whose presence has been justi-
fied by the claim that they are
teaching the heathen Japanese
the “democratic Australian way
of life”—which, on the 8.C.0.F.
showing, includes three servants
to the family, washing done
every morning, free motor trans-
port, boots polished by servant
girls, and picture shows, leave
free or at nominal charge in
millionaire hotels, telephone in
every house, and many other
amenities which some of the
teachers have never heard of,
much less experienced, before
coming to Japan.
The inner-spring mattresses on
which the soldiery sleep are “pro-
cured.” The big picture-shows
are “procured.” The millionaire
resorts at which the weary ex-
peditionary plays his golf and en-
joys the delights of a higher life
with his family in order to allow
him to recuperate from the ex-
acting task of superintending
the Japanese mechanics attached
to the forces working are “pro-
cured” and a matter of continual
pride to the occupying com-
mand. No visitor save by force
majeure can escape from the de-
lights of the Kawana Hotel at
Ito, which is the pride of
8.C.0.F.’s heart. The trains in
which the humblest occupier
travels in luxury and free from
the care of buying a ticket are
“procured.”
The amazing laundry service
which whisks off one’s shirts and
collars every morning and has
them back spotless in the after-
noon is “procured,” and so are
all the boot- and button-polish-
ing, the bag-carrying, the jeep-
driving, the beast-of-burden
duties which are performed by
Japanese labor and everything
else which makes life possible on
the 0.0. scale.
Land, conveniences, housing,
servants, they are all “procured,”
and upon a lavish scale in keep-
ing with an atmosphere in which
th e Temporary Lieutenant-
General who commands the
British forces —now consisting
almost entirely of Australians
and whose numbers nobody
seems to know exactly, since
every senior officer who is asked
differs about it over the range of
6000 to 8000—has three houses,
each on a palatial scale, with
perhaps 70 servants all told,
special trains, special launches
and a fleet of big black Humbers
sent out by the United Kingdom
Government which would be
worthy of Buckingham Palace
or the Viceroy’s House at New
Delhi.
Charge to Reparations
If one murmurs that all thjs
is very' expensive, the carefree
reply is that it all comes out of
the Japanese reparations, that it
is a fatiguing business to occupy
an enemy country, that living is
painfully dear. But when the
subject is talked out, one fact
always emerges: The average
member of 8.C.0.F. hates the
thought of going home. The
names Duntroon and Westralia
make him or her start.
And who shall blame them?
Not I, who have come into this
Paradise, with all its scenic
beauty and all its servants, com-
forts and ? amenities so remini-
scent of everything which true
“democratic” Australians have
been taught to hold contemptible
and effete in the Indian Sahib
of the old school, out of R.A.A.F.
quarters in Darwin where the
cigarette-butts lie multitudin-
ously trampled on the bare
boarded living-room floor and
two greasy eggs cataract across
a rumpled cloth against a jail-
type coffee-cup under the name
of breakfast.
No one can be blamed for not
wishing to return to such places
as Darwin, where beer can only
be bought regularly in the
town at one and threepence a
glass—here it is, of course,
“procured” and costs eightpence
Australian a bottle. But I, and
I think every other sober-minded
visitor who can resist the hypno-
tism which is applied to all
observers, am inclined to believe
that procurement for occupation
forces has gone far enough and
that it is about time that pro-
curement for the benefit of the
Australian taxpayer were about
to begin—the more soberminded
British have come to this con-
clusion long ago and left us to
our loaves and fishes.
It would have been far better
if some of the requisitions against
the Japanese had been made to
give security for life to the
widows and children of the
Eighth and' other divisions who
died in the war and to the de-
pendants of those natives who
gave their lives to save our boys
in Borneo. In the light of our
neglect of these * devoted people
the luxuries of 8.C.0.F. are apt
to make the thinking visitor
hang his head.
The Deadwood
If the force we have in Japan
were wholly ade facto occupation
force, it would be another mat-
ter, but it “occupies” only by
grace of General MacArthur,
and much of it is superfluous
deadwood typical of the fussy,
interfering Administration at
Canberra. Teams of young men
were roaming the country in uni-
form a few weeks ago teaching
the Japanese to carry out a
democratic election, though some
of the teachers, on my desultory
examination of them, would be
incapable of scrutineering a
shire-council poll in Boulia.
A major is teaching the nation
which made the wonderful
Marunouchi district in Tokyo
and designed the breathtaking
Meiji gardens and a traditional
architecture which is lovely to
the humblest room, wall and
cultured tree how to plan
cities. Democrats who represent
the democracy of Messrs. Ward,
Garden and Calwell are (with
crown or three stars up as the
symbols of democracy) teaching
the principles of freedom in a
land which is ringing with
cynical laughter at the attempts
of the Canberra Government to
force its unwilling lady citizens
to come home to their slave
State of Australia.
Bands of other officers, many
of them qualified initially by six
or eight months at an Army
school in a language which that
fine natural linguist Peter Russo
and others of his kind tell me
it took them five years to get on
friendly terms with, roam the
countryside gauging public
opinion and reporting thereon in
the best Canberra manner.
And majors, captains, lieu-
tenants and sergeants, all in
uniform, all living in pukka
messes in a procured hos-
pital, and fathered by a
C.S.M. who keeps a Japanese
servant in a dinner-jacket and a
black tie to wait on him and his
guests, produce what is prob-
ably the most expensively run
tabloid newspaper of its size and
circulation in the world on the
procured printing presses of
“Mainichi” in Osaka...let it
be said that it is a very good one
as newspapers of the type go.
Free, wide and handsome
amenities services, under a lieu-
tenant-colonel, provide all these
ardent toilers with amusements,
free accommodation and sport.
All this goes on in an area in
which there is an “Allied” — i.e.,
in practice, American—Govern-
ment functioning with its teams.
The Proud Infantry
Most of our departments,
attached and controlled by the
8.C.0.F. Command -in - Chief,
will scarcely be missed. Their
contents will go back to oivil
life. The permanent infantry
battalions of the 34th Brigade
under Brigadier R. G. Hopkins
and their ancillaries are another
matter. They are purely Aus-
tralian, and their command is
Australian and responsible in in-
ternal matter's directly to the
Minister for the Army. Having
no functions which are non-
military in a broad sense, the
continued maintenance of the
brigade in Japan for expedi-
tionary training would be fully
justified, especially in view of
the opportunities there for regu-
lar liaison with the US. fighting
forces, beside which it is inevit-
able that we must henceforth
fight.
It is a pity that even the
Japanese must know that the
thin battalions which parade
so nobly in white webbing
and scarlet sash and which
provide imposing guards upon
the space before the Emperor’s
front gate in Tokyo are not
what they appear to be—the
skimmed cream, the ceremonial
detachments of a huge and grim
Army—but the very substance of
Australia’s military might, the
coherent and articulated skeleton
of the only operational brigade
which this country possesses and
which will, presumably, cease to
exist as a cohesive whole when
it returns to Australia.
There, if it is not killed by
Canberra, urged on by its yelping
Communist masters, it will fall
to pieces through the reluctance
of its members to remain in
it once they are reduced to
performing the menial tasks of
which they are free in Japan
and become part of the dull
round of military existence on
Australian stations.
And this is sad, despite the
fact that its ranks are already so
thin that its three battalions are
scarcely sufficient to make the
one which it is intended to leave
behind when the general exodus
takes place before March next
year.
It is impossible for any Aus-
tralian to meet the men of these
battalions in the streets, their
heads carried high, always good-
humored, models in deportment
and behavior, wearing their dis-
tinctive uniforms with an air,
without a thrill of pride.
It is almost impossible to
watch one of their parades with
all the color and music and cere-
monial which they perform with
the aplomb of guardsmen with-
out tears coming into one’s eyes.
They are as fine an advertise-
ment as this country has ever
had anywhere, and, with their
Roman-numeral battalion num-
bers up, their name has become
a legend throughout the East.
They and their equally smart
but more lively comrades of the
R.A.A.F. are the best ambas-
sadors this country could have
under any conditions. The test
of their usefulness is that no-
body regrets their whittling down
to an overall group of 2000
more than the Americans, who
themselves are increasing their
forces ill Japan on a purposeful
scale, while delegating more and
more civilian administration to
the Japanese.

RED MILL RUM.
And so another Melbourne Cup has
been transmuted from a matter of
national speculation to a mere entry
in the record-books. Most of the
speculation was sadly astray, but the
1948 Melbourne Cup, won by Rimfire,
did provide its quota of new facts
for the record-books.
A crowd of 90,000-odd—or, at
least, part of that crowd —witnessed
the most thrilling Cup finish seen
since Hall Mark defeated Shadow
King by a head in 1933; it was,
consequently, the first Melbourne Cup
that has been judged by the camera.
Handily placed at the home turn,
Rimfire shot to the front in the
straight. 'The Victoria Derby-winner
Comic Court challenged, but had soon
done his dash. Then the Sydney Cup-
winner Dark Marne set after the
leader; slipping up on the inside Dark
Marne made a grand effort, but an
advantage of 231 b. in the weights
enabled Rimfire to just last it out.
Rimfire won by half a head; three-
and-a-half lengths further back Saxony
shaded Comic Court for third money.
With the Caulfield Cup and Vic-
toria Derby already won by rough
’uns, Rimfire’s success at 66 to 1
gave doubles bookies a thorough
skinner, and was a joyous thing for
the straight-out men. Saxony was
also at long odds (40 to 1), but Dark
Marne had been heavily backed to
second favoritism at 12 to 1. The
favorite, of course, was Howe at 7
to 4—the hottest favorite; since Beau
Vite in 1940. Howe wa» in trouble
most of the way; he shouldered his
way through to see daylight in the
straight, but couldn’t raise a finishing
run. The impression of Howe was
that his magnificent effort in winning
the Hotham Handicap was the effort
that should have won the Melbourne
Cup.
Rimfire won in the course record
time of 3.21; previous best was the
3.21! set by Wotan and equalled by
Russia. Prepared for the race by
S. Boyden, Rimfire was ridden by the
youngest and probably least-ex-
perienced rider that has ever won the
Cup. Apprentice R. Neville was a
day short of 16 years of age, had held
a permit for only two months and
had but nine previous mounts in
races.
Owned, and bred at St. Albans
stud, by V.R.C. committeeman H. G.
Raymond, Rimfire is a six-year-old
chestnut gelding of rather plain P
pearance by the imported stallion
Enfield. Enfield was a great stayer,
winning over distances of two miles,
twS miles and a furlong, two and a
quarter miles and two miles six t
longs. There was an interesting breed-
ing contrast between the pair that
fought out the Cup Th® h ’ M ?me
Marne being a son of The Marne,
who was a sprinter pure and simple.
The success of Grey Nurse in the
Oaks Stakes run on Thursday gave
Sydney owner F. W. Hughes a unique
double. Twice in succession he has
won the double of Wakeful Stakes
and Oaks with grey daughters ot
Nizami; last year it was Nizam s
Ring. Quite comfortably defeating
Lady Luby and Blessing, Grey Nurse
covered the 12 furlongs in the smart
time of 2.32}.
From the punters’ viewpoint the
four-days spring meeting was disas-
trous. Saturday was the final day,
and punters had to wait until the last
race before a favorite was successful.
To prolong the agony, five races re-
sulted in photo.-finishes, and in four
races -protests were entered.
Only one of the protests was suc-
cessful. In the J. A. Macleod Steeple,
Briar defeated David Star by a head.
Tiring badly towards the finish, how-
ever, Briar had considerably ham-
pered David Star, who was awarded
the race on protest. Unsuccessful
protests were those on behalf of
Ellerslie, beaten by Clement (R.
Heather) in the mile Batman Stakes;
of Kintail, just shaded by Gilt Archer
(J. Thompson) in the Flemington
Stakes for two-year-olds; and of Sol-
vive against favorite Filipino in the
Final Handicap.
The Helios colt Phoibos (H. Badger)
notched up another first-class win by
downing Dark Marne, Beau Gem and
a couple of others in the w.f.a. C. B.
Fisher Plate (12f.). Phoibos looks one
of the very best of the three-year-olds
—brilliant enough to lead all the way
against any company over the short
trips, yet amenable to being ridden a
patient race, and able to see out
middle-distances at least. He has so
far won seven races and a shade
under £lO,OOO in stakes.
* * * *
The S.T.C. evidently intends to see
that as many owners as possible
shall know the joy of seeing their
colors carried to success. Mixed
Stakes and a variety of other special-
weight affairs provide chances for
many nags that wouldn’t have much
hope in other company. From the
point of detailed classification the
Set Weight Race included in Satur-
day’s card at Canterbury was a
bobby-dazzler.
This latest innovation was restricted
to three-, four- and five-year-olds
which had never at the time of start-
ing “won a flat race the added prize-
money for which exceeded £1000.”
According to age they carried 7.7,
8.7 and 8.9 respectively.
Fillies and mares received an allow-
ance of 31b. Winners of any race
other than Maiden, Novice, Encour-
age, Trial or Two-year-old, the added
money for which was £5OO or more,
carried 71b. penalty for one win and
101 b. penalty for two or more wins.
The piece de resistance of the con-
ditions, however, was the provision
of a 51b. allowance for “horses, at
the time of starting, not having won
a flat race at the last five starts.”
Just to prevent anyone doubling up
on such a tasty dish, the added money
was £lOOO (vide Clause 1), making it
the richest race on the card.
The S.T.C. is to be commended
upon its desire to provide chances
for the less talented, but it is to be
hoped that it draws the line some-
where before we arrive at races with
heavy penalties for last-start-beaten
favorites, good-things-beaten or un-
lucky-to-losers, and lenient allowances
for horses with four white' feet, baldy
noses, parrot mouths, winter coats or
plaited tails.
Saturday’s affair, at any rate, was
won by Cragside (G. Moore), who,
after careful calculation, carried Bst.,
to beat Ulterior and Nell Gwynne.
Other main events at Canterbury, the
Flying and Canterbury Park Handi-
caps, went respectively to Penmore
(H. Darke) and Gay Fault (G.
Moore). Penmore has the breeding
and all the cut of a better-than-average
sprinter.

To beat the colts over the Derby
distance it takes an exceptionally
good filly, and such must be rated
Blue Slipper, who won the Queens-
land classic at Eagle Farm on Satur-
day. A full sister to the Brisbane
Cup-winner Blue Boots (The Buzzard-
Blue Skirt), Blue Slipper had already
won the Guineas and in the Derby
fairly outstayed Moneith; she was
level with the colt at the turn, and
wore him down in the straight to win
by three-parts of a length in 2.32.

Due to begin shortly, the season’s
major tennis championships start
with the N.S.W. titles contested at
White City from November 19. For
years past the dominance of Nancye
Bolton has taken most of the interest
from the women’s events, but this
year the L.T.A. has imported the
highly-rated young American player
Doris Hart, whose meetings with Mrs.
Bolton and Mrs. Long should make
for fine tennis. Unfortunately, how-
ever, Miss Hart is to partner, instead
of playing against, Nancye Bolton in
the doubles.

has collected 49 points, which puts
him well at the head of the list. If
the Australian Rugby League people
didn’t learn the lesson during the Eng-
lish tour of these parts, they should
now at least be convinced that brawn
and the crude application thereof is
not the winning factor in any code of
football.

With Joe Louis in possible retire-
ment, an American sports writer
recently investigated the whereabouts
of the ex-champs, and found
a surprising number still on deck:
“It is a matter of 49 years ago
that Jim Jeffries knocked out Bob
Fitzsimmons. The heavyweight cham-
pions followed in this order: Burns,
Johnson, Willard, Dempsey, Tunney,
Schmeling, Sharkey, Camera, Baer,
Braddock and Louis. From this
parade of 12 men only Johnson is
missing, and he was killed in a motor-
car accident. The span from Jeffries
to Louis covers almost half a century
and to have 11 out of the 12 former
champions still inhabiting this planet
is full proof that they are a hardy
lot.”
“Two men still in fine shape are
Dempsey and Tunney, who look as
former champions ought to look. It
might also be mentioned that outside
of Louis the two old rivals are better
fixed financially than any other heavy-
weight in history. I understand
Sharkey isn’t doing too badly and
Camera has been mopping up in the
weird and incredible wrestling game.
Braddock doesn’t look hungry. Jeff-
ries has been running a boxing school
and holding fight nights. Baer, the
king of goofs, is a hit with Maxie
Rosenbloom in one of those double-
entry night-club acts. The last time
I talked with Baer and Rosenbloom,
both told me the other guy was too
nutty to work with. Oddly enough
each was right.”

Down to the lightweight limit (9.9.),
Ken Bailey boxed exceptionally well
to decisively outpoint Jackie Wilson
(9.4|') at Leichhardt. Attacking hard
and fast Bailey had Wilson fairly run-
ning backwards, which caused Bailey
to miss with many of his leads, but
more than enough of them connected.
With Patrick retired the Australian
lightweight title is vacant, and Bailey,
despite lacking a knockout punch,
looks too good for any of the other
contenders.

“Betcha”: Surprising the number of
blokes who plump for well-bred racing
stock in horseflesh for every occasion.
“Blood will tell” is their time-honored

pampered aristocrat when what they want
is a hardy stockhorse. Granted that for
simple roadwork the aristocrat looks and

perience is that the hardy bush-bred soon
lays him out in rough hill country. Nor

“Solitude” : Seventyfiver had one boot
off, trying to bash out an intruding nail
with a length of rusty iron, and as he
heard me whistling out he came, hopping
like a foundered nag. “You goin’ the
short cut, Sol?” he called. “Well, y’ll
find ol’ man Collins cuttin’ timber in
Dead Gully. Tell him I want a tin o’
stock drench, will y’? He’ll be goin’

agreed, “but how’ll you get it back?”

the old bloke explained easily, “an’ the

“Joe John”: Can’t say I’ve tasted tea
and olive oil (B. 6 /10/’4B), but I’ve had
it made with tank-, tap-, bore- and well-
water of varying degrees of purity. I’ve
broken it down with lemon juice, cow
juice (fresh and condensed), goat milk
and cold water. I’ve sweetened it with
sugar and honey and have heard of
golden syrup and treacle being used for
the same purpose. But the strangest
mixture I’ve tasted was provided by a,
Latin on a N.Q. cane-farm. He offered
me tea liberally laced with wine. It was
a waste of two good drinks.

“B. A. Ker”: Noticing that a snail
which had attached itself to the brickwork
near the window was still there three days
later, I wondered how long a dead snail
would retain the suction that kept it in
position. Two more days passed ; then
I found it had moved and was now
stuck firmly in the middle of the
window-pane 18in. higher up. Thus,
starting out to find the answer to
one question I found myself baffled with
four. Firstly, why did the snail leave
good fodder to climb up a wall that
offered neither food nor protective damp-
ness? Secondly, why did it remain
stationary on a hot wall for five days?
Thirdly, why did it continue upwards
away from food and protecting cover?
Fourthly, if the observers are correct who
claim that a snail progresses by faying a
bed of slime and sliding over it, how did
that snail lay a bed and slide up a
slippery pane of glass? A fifth question
arises, but I think I could get the answer
in two guesses: Thirty-odd years ago the
paddock where this house stands had
never been used as a garden ; and there
were no snails —even when good rains
made an abundance of long, rank grass.
Either the spawn was introduced in the
soil around plants and young trees or
cultivation automatically breeds snails.

“No. 1 Bench”: Jarrah is a softwood:
provided you know how to pick. Serving
a novitiate in a big Perth mill, with per-
haps a million super, feet of jarrah
stacked, I was shown how by an old-
timer. “When you are looking for soft
furniture-wood always take note of the
ends of the stacked timber. Pass over
the smooth-sawn ends, pick the roughest
and most furry you can find. That’s the
soft jarrah, so soft it tends to mash under
the crosscut.” Following this principle
in selection my old-timer could bring in
material for fine furniture that was almost
like cedar; certainly not much harder
than the cedar from N.S.W. North Coast.
Mellow, so that it could easily be pared
with a former chisel, it had a finely
crystal sort of glint in the grain. On the
other hand, by choosing slabs almost
glass-smooth on the end-grain one could
produce a dressed jarrah so hard as to be
almost capable of taking a cutting-edge.
In between were a dozen or more stages
of hardness or softness. One expert
around the mill used to argue that there
were 20 different varieties of jarrah, from
the dark cedar-like variety, through
various stages of hardness, back to a
very light variety that would work almost
like a piece of hoop-pine. Still, most
jarrah is hard and heavy.

“Zake”: One of Coleman’s kids had
caught a mouse battling for its life in an
open can of cream. He was holding it up
triumphantly by the tail when Coleman
came into the shed. To save getting a clip
in the ear in case his old man thought he d
just been dipping the rodent in the cream
for fun, Wally got in first and explained
how he had come upon it trying to swim
out of the can. Then the kid brought his
2rm back preparatory to bowling the be-
creamed mouse at the wall. But his sire,
a born hater of waste in any form, was
quicker. Grabbing the slippery swimmer
out of the kid’s hand he swilled it briskly
through a can of milk before putting his
number nines on its head.

“Horseless Horseman”: I’ve seen the
landscape in the Murchison (W.A.)
colored with wildflowers and likewise the
inclines of the Grampians (Vic.), but I’ve
had to come to East Gippsland to enthuse
about this flora. Other than Sturt’s
desert pea, for color and beauty no native
wildflowers I’ve seen in bloom compare
with those at the present time on the
narrow strip of coastal plain between
Mallacoota bar and Little Rame Head.
A motley of every known hue, they grow
mostly in bush form, a foot or so high.
And what delightful names they have!
You see the vivid yellows of the prickly
Moses, the double-tails and the yellow-
tails contrasted with the purple-pink of
the black-eyed Susans —they have black
eyes, too —and the crimsons of pink-
fingers and bottle-brushes. Then there
are the clear blues of the leafless milk-
worts, of pea-flowers and of bluebells,
the mauve of the wild iris, the violet of
the toothed nightshade, etc., offset by the
wjiites of heaths and the reds of the red
rust-plant, orchids and, best of all, the
drumlike forms of the native fuchsia.
As for varieties —well, along 50yds. of a
wallaby-pad we collected 29 varieties.
But rarely anyone sees this magnificent
sight. Beyond an odd angler or a very
occasional horseman or hiker, this coast
is little visited at any time.

“Esk D.”: The Back to Bunglebobba
celebrations are in full swing and a large
crowd of former pupils, in schoolday
costumes, are playing hopscotch, marbles
and pranks in the grounds of their Alma
Mater. Tbm Dripps, said to be the first
pupil enrolled, is arguing the point with
Jorkins, one of his contemporaries. Tom’s
full set of whiskers are fairly trembling
with anger. “It was over in the corner
near that yellerbox, I tell y\” he screeches.
“I knocked one o’ y’r front teeth out
an’ blacked y’r eye for y’.” “Square
up, Tom,” Jorkins scoffs. “I bled
y’r nose with me first clout, an’ y’
started snivellin’ an’ wouldn’t fight any
more. An’ it was there behind the dunny
it happened.” “By Jings, I stoushed y’
then an’ I’ll stoush y’ agen,” Tom shouts
in a fiery treble. “Come orn, trot y’r
carcass out where I c’n git a smack at it
an’ ” Here timely intervention pre-
vents a repetition of schoolboy history,
and the quarrelling pair, both nearing 90,
are herded back to the calmer joys of
three-holes and hopscotch.

“Camsa”: The Digger who, allotted a
block in S.A.’s 90-mile desert after the
1914-18 war, told the Repat. Minister he
was going to “grow flaming aspros” on
it should have hving on. For the first
time in Australian history an insurance
co. is buying land for settlement by ex-
servicemen and others, venue being the
90-mile desert. Ten years ago on the
edge of the desert the top wool never
reached half the best market price. This
year, thanks to copper-sulphate and zinc
treatment of the soil, wool from the
desert edge topped one of the Adelaide
sales at 89d. Properly treated the desert
can carry two sheep to the acre, which
isn’t bad for a desert.

“Narab”: In the U.S.A. earthworms
are likely to become an article of com-
merce, apart from their common use as
fishbait. With the idea of trying to re-
claim a few of the millions of acres
stripped to the subsoil by wind- and
water-erosion, agricultural investigators
have had dumped on to selected plots
anything and everything of a vegetable
and animal nature, from municipal
garbage to sawdust. Into this at the
proper season are introduced a few gal-
lons of earthworms. With an environment
absolutely crammed with nutriment
Lumbricus eats and multiplies prodigi-
ously, in the process transforming all the
crude organic matter into fine topsoil.
One experimenter claims that by such
methods he has produced 9in. of new
soil within five years: a result that nature
unaided would not have attained in five
centuries.

“Etiwanda”: That dead ringtail possum
hanging by the tail to the gum branch
(B. 3/11/ ’4B) reminds me of the day I
spotted a ringneck parrot hanging to a
branch above a Mildura channel and per-
forming evolutions.in the wind. Watched
its gyrations for a while, then was sud-
denly struck by the fact that the parrot
didn’t care how close 1 was. It had been
dead so long that the feathers in the
mummified skin covered only a skeleton,
and the grip of the beak on the stick was
so strong that it took a decided effort to
break it. Years afterwards was one of
a party that found a decomposed human
corpse in the dry country out of Forbes
(N.S.W.). The thumb and first two fingers
of the right hand had an equally fixed
grip on a dried cigarette-butt.

“Anthropo”: Akin to the South Sea
islands method of brewing kava-kava (B.
13/10/’4B) and not less acceptable to a
primitive people is the abo. method of
preparing infant food and predigested
nourishment for the sick and old. See-
ing nothing unhygienic about it, a full-
toothed abo. will’take a piece of tough
meat, masticate it to a pulp, then finger-
feed it to the infant or the patient. As a
means of supplementing a child’s nourish-
ment as it grows and the maternal milk
becomes insufficient, the practice has
existed for ages., And not a few whites
have won back to life by the same means.
Back in 1932 Hans Bertram and his com-
panion, lost for 40 days along the coast of
the northern Kimberleys, were succored
by blacks from the Drysdale Mission, who
had been dispatched to search for Jhe
lost airmen. When found —the blacks
traced footprints to the hollow between
two big rocks, which was the castaways'
last refuge—Bertram was in a pretty bad
way, while his companion, Klausemann,
was on the point of death. Bertram
gave full credit to masticated food in
Klausemann’s survival.

“Betcha”: The man-on-the-land might
be the continent’s ace groucher, but I’d
like to know any bloke, anywhere, with
greater cause. At the moment, my con-
cern is a prolonged dry spell that
has caused a serious shortage of feed.
After a few weeks of watching the sheep
fall off in condition, I decided there was
nothing for it but hand-feeding. Followed
days of chasing supplies, hunting a
carrier, withstanding the shock of prices ;
then I started out to feed the jumbucks.
They hadn’t seen maize before. They
wouldn’t eat it. Patiently I stuck to the
job, daily visiting each paddock in turn,
scattering the tucker and holding the
woollies on it till an occasional ewe
began to nibble. These found it good,
indulged lavishly, and, through seeing
them, a few more joined in. But
the rest still stand by exasperat-
ingly, growing slowly weaker. If I stop
around the jummies watch me, and won’t
hunt the feed. If I move off the cocka-
toos immediately descend gid mop it up.
This week, in the home Apaddock, I’ve
lost six scrags through pc /erty, and five
big, better-conditioned e\Qs, with lambs
at foot, through an overdose of grain.
Well, wouldn't it?

“Mat’s Mate”: “Sourest mob I ever
see,” said Mat, “was way out in the Sunset
country, north o’ the Murrayville line. It
was a little bit of a district called Duddo
Bore, and there’s about eight or nine
families livin’ round. Y’ never saw such
a mob. They’d come t’ the little hall,
which was a church when it wasn’t a hall,
an’ sit round lookin’ at the ground an’
hardly sayin’ a word—not even talkin’
about rain or rabbits, which just shows
y’. Far as I could make out, about
sight or nine year before this they started
one o’ them back-country feuds. One
bloke had a keg o’ beer sent up for har-
vest; another bloke had done the same
thing. The second bloke went in t’ the
railway, sights a keg an’ grabs it. Next
train another keg comes an’ some lumpers
swipe it. When the first bloke gets in an’
finds no keg he reckons the second bloke
pinched it, havin’ heard there was beer
at his place. That started the feud. For
three years this Duddo Bore country is
full o’ black eyes an’ blood noses; they
wait on each other along the roads ; the
kids brawl at school; any bloke comes t’
work around there gets pulled in on one
side or the other—cripes, y’ never knew
who was goin’ to charge out o’ the
scrub an’ dong y’ an’ y’d see blokes goin’
each other everywhere. Well, about four
harvests later one o’ them lumpers come
back. He hears about the row, so gets
hold o’ the bloke who lost the beer, tells
him what happened an’ that the lumpers
had put in t’ pay for it an’ give him the
money but he had t’ go away in a hurry
an’ forgot about it. Then he hands it
over, an’ the row’s settled.” He fell

“Be your age,” he says. “The poor cows

years.”

“Gravelsnatcher”: When the Wynd-
ham (W.A.) meatworks originally com-
menced operations the Broome pearlers
looked forward to tinned-dog fresh from
the source. The stuff
arrived, but not
direct from Wynd-
ham. Some depart-
mental regulation de-
manded that it be’
sent to Perth and reshipped back north.
I’d classed that as the height of absurdity
in supply (B. 13/10/’4B) until I saw a
Perth firm’s announcement that gifts of
toys to English children could be
arranged by the payment of the price
only —no freight charges. The explana-
tion was that the firm had bought the
toys, for export only, in England and
had stored them there. The price re-
flected the saving in freight and Customs
dues, and the deal is quite permissible,
since the English regulations insist only
that the goods must be sold on the ex-
port market —they need not actually be
exported. Thus articles made in Eng-
land may still be purchased there pro-
vided the English can arrange for the
payment to be made in another country.

“Bo”: Tommy, the old hatter, without
bothering about such a trifle as per-
mission, put up his bough-and-slab kipsy
on some Cro.wn land which carried a
heavy stand of bluegum. Then Parry,
who owned the sawmill at Tywire, .15
miles away, secured the felling rights, and
one morning arrived with a few fellers
to start operations. While his spotter
was selecting the trees Parry tackled old
Tommy. But to all entreaties, threats and
cajolery, the old hatter remained un-
moved. He took up a battered tome,
sat in his doorway and told them to go
for their lives. Parry’s men were experts
who could almost drop a tree oh a shilling-
piece. At a word from Parry they lined
up a 150-footer and soon the Plumbs
were biting deep. Ten seconds after the
fellers’ warning call the giant fell thun-
derously 10 yards from one side of the
hut. Tommy didn’t even look up from
his reading. The next one crashed the
same distance from the back of the hut.
Tommy evinced not the slightest interest.
Throughout the day trees continued to
hurtle down in the immediate precincts
of his dwelling, but they may have been
butterflies for all Tommy appeared con-
cerned. The first tree that was felled
the next morning dropped a good 200
feet from the hut. Two seconds after it
hit the ground the hatter rushed out,
furious. “Can’t you cows be more care-
ful an’ make less noise?” he yelled. “Me
cat’s had kittens durin’ the night. Y’re
scarin’ the daylights out of ’er!”

“Rawhiti”: I see there’s been talk
of planting wheat found in the ruins of
Pompeii. There will be nothing remark-
able if it grows—wheat found in the
Great Pyramid, 4000 years old, was
planted and grew. Years ago, when
the Wellington viaduct was being built
in Auckland, some of the seabed was
pumped up for filling, and on this soil,
when it had dried, appeared a crop of
flowers of the poppy variety, but un-
known to local bo&nists. Thpy flourished
for a season only, then died and never
appeared again.

“D.R.H.”: The old dog-fox made the
fatal mistake of robbing one of my traps
for the second time. By the time
I had carefully opened and washed out
his small intestine I had a sizeable
handful of tapeworms. Each worm
started as a tiny head, equipped with
hooks and suckers with which to anchor
to its host’s tissues. The rest of the
thing consisted of a gradually-widen-
ing series of sections, each complete in
itself, with its own set of organs, except-
ing the digestive system —no longer
necessary to a creature living in a per-
petual food bath. Towards the middle of
“It Wasn't drawing too good."
the long white length the still immature
sections were equipped with male sex
organs. Further to the rear the riper
sections showed both male and female
systems. Each one of these sections was
capable of mating with a similar section
in another worm, with a neighboring
section in the same worm, or even of self-
fertilisation. Further back still the sec-
tions showed eggs developing and male
organs degenerating, while the last sec-
tions had become mere bags of eggs,
ready to drop off and pass out in the
droppings of the host. One such ripe
section, in a drop of water on a glass
slide, would, at the slightest applied
pressure, shed a milky cloud —a cloud
made up of thousands of tiny eggs. As
there were probably a hundred or so of
such egg-bags ripe for shedding, the old
fox was, from the tapeworms’ point of
view, a highly efficient distributor and
colonising agent.

“Zake”: One of the favorite fallacies
of the bush is that the conformation of a
snake’s set of grinders is such that it
can’t let go once it starts on a meal. This
belief has been strengthened by the occa-
sional finding of the reptilian corpses,
where one had unsuccessfully tried to
bolt the other in a one-course meal, the
impression being that Joe, being unable
to back-pedal either his chewing ap-
paratus or his digestive organs, has to
keep on going once he’s started on a live
meal and hope for the best. I recall that
.in my youth a big python at the Sydney
Zoo swallowed a double blanket and
three days later ejected it, rather tightly
rolled. A few years later at the same
zoo a four-foot tiger-snake which
couldn’t get down the last six inches of a
brown snake only slightly smaller than
itself was forcibly persuaded to cough
it up, which it did by walking backwards
a few paces.

“Sou’-west”: With mosquito bites, as
with bald heads, some suffer, some don’t.
Snatching a crust during the depression by
prawning I had as mates Peter, an ex-
shearer, burnt brick-red by the Ashburton
and Gascoyne suns, and Victor, who had
graduated from a city office. Dragging
the net along mosquito-infested river
shallows, Pete worked rugged up to the
neck, while Vic wore an ancient outfit of
bathers which left most of his back and
all shoulders and arms bare. Yet it was
Pete who moaned about the mossies, such
parts as he found difficult to cover being
savagely bitten, and then swelling with
blue lumps reminiscent of smallpox. Of
course, Victor’s seemingly delicate skin
suffered an occasional nip, but there were
no after-effects. In fact, he rather liked
the pests to land in places where he could
smack ’em. Often he would let one get
its beak well anchored so as to be sure
there’d be no escape. Peter used to
reckon he wouldn’t do such a thing, not
for a shilling a time. Yet Pete’s hide
looked 100 per cent, more resistant than
Victor’s blond whiteness.

“Wippegong”: A stiff westerly tear-
ing down the full length of the billabong
had made the water choppy and the
yabbies were hard to land, so old Bob
reckoned we’d give them a spell and go
after birds instead. There were plenty to
see; galahs and budgees were nesting all
across the plains ; pelicans hung motion-
less, head to wind, high above the river-
gums ; teal forgot their timidity as they
wheeled like escorting corvettes round the
ripples where their chicks had submerged
and flocks of newly-returned wood-
swallows raised a racket as they simul-
taneously sought grasshoppers and nest-
ing sites. Then Bob remembered there
used to be a homestead in the belt of
cypress and wilga ahead, and old pepper-
trees are favorite places for spotties to
make their bowers. The first pepperina
shaded a rabbit-warren; the second, an-
other ; but under the third there rose the
well-ordered walls of a bower. The
central platform was raised and decorated
with six fresh gruie berries, which led
old Bob into a dissertation on the fasti-
dious whims of bowerbirds —there being
plenty of blossom about, yet no gruie-tree
within a mile of the bower —and then
on to the theory that the only gruie seeds
to germinate easily are those which have
passed through the alimentary tract of an
emu. Then, his eye wandering to the
motley collection that paved the ap-
proaches to the playground, the naturalist
in Bob was suddenly overridden by the
carpenter. “ ’Struth! ”he muttered, with
incredulous joy. “You can’t buy these
darned things now!” And from the
accumulated bits of bone and broken
glass he triumphantly gathered 43 good
galvanised roofing screws.

“Herbert Dawson”: We need not turn
to American and British magazines to
read ridiculous stories of Australian bush
life. Seeing an illustration depicting an
old red kangaroo bailed up and standing
on his toes with his tail curled in between
his legs, I thought the story, in an Aus-
tralian-monthly, might have interesting
features. It had.
The red ’roo leapt for the river, his
gleaming body inclined forward to assist
the tremendous propulsive power of a tail
that could kill with a single sweep .... a
powerful hindleg flashed up from the
stream, five-inch claws, sharp as needles,
distended and ready for the kill. The leg
poised in mid-air for a moment, as though
its owner were gauging the degree of thrust,
and then it flashed down in a single terrify-
ing, tearing sweep
Result, a dog instantaneously disem-
bowelled. The site of these unusual hap-
penings was the Kowmung. Well, are
there red kangaroos about the Kowmung?
The only ’roos I have seen near there
have been grey foresters. But that is a
detail. I have often grabbed a wounded
’roo by the tail in order to apply a waddy
to his head. If I had imagined that a
single sweep could have ended my exist-
ence I’d have been more careful. The
only times I have seen a ’roo with hr' tail
between his legs have been
when he was squatting down in the shade
and delousing or debur*viig his tail with
his front gdt into that position
he lies on his sjie, crosses one leg over
his tail, and rising on his hocks shuffles
backwards along the alleged death-dealer,
until he is sitting squarely on its butt.

“Old-timer”: We were riding the back
country of Moonlight, out from Euston
(mid-Murray), when we came upon the
old hat. A little later we sighted a shirt,
then a pair of boots. Pocketknife’s eyes
narrowed and he said, “He’s started
throwin’ his clobber off, so he’s in a bad
way. See any tracks?” Neither of us
could see any footprints, but there was no
mistaking the marks of sulky-wheels
which wandered aimlessly. “Cripes,” said
Pocketknife, “I never heard of a bloke
bein’ lost an’ doin’ a perish drivin’ a
sulky, but that’s how she looks.” We
rode on. The next sign was a pair of
pants. Then both of our neddies
pricked their ears and one whinnied.
About half a mile across the open patch
we saw, coming towards us out of a
needlewood hill, a sulky driven by a nude
man. We approached him warily, but his
eyes were all right and he grinned at our
astonishment and said “Blasted black ants.
Wheel hit a tree back there ancljhe little
blankers fell down like a shower. Got
into me everywhere, so chucked off me
clobber an’ druv round for a while.
Reckon a man can pick it up now ; they’ll
be all gone. Any kanga shootin’ t’ be
got round here?”
* * * *
“Chuck”: Was after a fox the other
day when he spotted me and disappeared
behind the trunk of a big yellow-box.
There was very little cover about, and,
thinking he must presently come from
behind his shelter, I waited. As he didn’t
reappear I ran quietly forward. Not a
sign, of Johnny, anywhere. I whistled
the mong I’d anchored when the quarry
was first sighted, and he eagerly took the
scent, following it up the long easy slope,
in a direct line with the tree-trunk and
the spot where I had been standing. It
could have been accidental. The get-
away was so neat, I checked the route
again. Recounting the incident to old
Bill, he merely remarked: “What’s
strange about that? ’Course a fox’ll
make use of a tree-trunk to keep out o’
sight.” “I can understand him advancing
towards one and keeping out of sight,”
I answered, “but you try walking the
other way without being glimpsed by
your stalker,” Bill declined, declaring he
was no fox, but reminded me that with
a dog on his rear a fox kept track of
his pursuer and dodged in that split-
second necessary to avoid capture. Ad-
mitted ; but claim that the dog is not
directly behind, when it happens. Would
like to know if any of the Council has
witnessed this tree-trunk ruse in Johnny.
GREEN HORSES.
Up springs the wind, holding sun’s golden reins,
The green team keen at the bit;
And, shaking up the reins of burnished gold,
Whips up that team of trees,
And over mountains high, and hills and plains,
The shining harness lit
With flowers and gems all flashing bright and
cold,
The green steeds race to the seas.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
“DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS.”
Wool Figures.
“Graz”: Everything is up on
the wool front. For the three
months ending September 30
selling centres had received
1,119,215 bales, a rise of 250,566
on the corresponding period for
1947. Sales totalled 422,532-
up 45,367. Average price for
greasy was 45.07 d., a rise of
13.76 d., or 43.9 per cent.;
scoured averaged 59.66 d., an in-
crease of 11.91 d., or 24.9 per
cent. J.O. bought-in 828 bales,
for which it paid £4004. For the
1947-48 season greasy averaged
39.5 d. per lb.
The U.S. Commerce Depart-
ment calculates * that consump-
tion of apparel wool in 1948-49
may exceed world production by
800 million pounds. America
expects to use slightly less wool
this year, but demand for
foreign wools is likely to be
good, as the U.S. domestic clip
is expected to be the smallest on
record.
Wheat-bags.
“Bunda”: If shortages are to
continue wheatgrowers and
handling authorities should for-
get about bags and adopt other
methods. A pointer was given
by W. A. Meares, of Forbes
(N.S.W.), when he returned from
a world tour sponsored by the
Rural Bank. Meares said that
U.S. growers deliver their wheat
in trucks with special bodies. If
dumps on the farms are neces-
sary is loaded or un-
loaded with auger-type elevators.
Meares was impressed by the
U.S. method, which should be
investigated to see .whfttwr it
can be adapted to our condi-
tions. Jute supplies are unlikely
to improve in the immediate
future.
“Carlyle”: With comsacks
four times their pre-war price
and the added expense of sew-
ing, the grain-auger exhibited at
.Victorian country shows merits
attention. Displayed by the
Victorian Grain Elevators
Board, it is designed to over-
come prejudice against bulk
handling, and, although
primarily intended for wheat,
the plant can be adapted to
handle bulk oats or barley.
Made in U.S.A., the auger
varies in diameter from five to
seven inches, and the greatest
length without a central bearing
is 27 inches. Its capacity varies
from 600 to 1600 bushels per
hour. It can be mounted on a
two-wheel carrier to which a
hoist has been fitted or rigged
up so that the head rests on the
top of the bulk-wheat container.
If the auger is for use on a
truck picking up wheat from
bulk containers on the ground,
or from bags in the paddock, or
direct from the harvester, it can
be operated by a power take-off
direct from the truck motor,
thus avoiding the outlay for a
stationary engine. Attached to
a 3-h.p. engine and operated at
an angle of 95 deg. a sin. auger
in a 6in. diameter casing and
15in. long will move wheat at
approximately 1000 bushels per
hour.
Stencil-cutting.
“Ben Acre”: It isn’t hard to
do. Light galvanised-iron or
kerosene-tin is suitable. Heavy
iron is too rigid, causing un-
wanted fractures when cutting.
Use a medium, fine-bladed cold-
chisel for straight cutting. A
small chisel might be needed for
small cuts. Curves are cut with
the corner of the chisel. The
chiseling-block must be hard,
preferably of hardwood or lead ;
if your chisel will stand it use a
piece of soft iron and hammer
lightly. Thus, the iron is cut,
not torn, and there is no frac-
turing.
The art of stencil-cutting is in
tying. At each place where
letter formation would make a
point leave a strip of metal
across the bar of the letter. Big
ties, as wide as the bar of the
letter, can be left without up-
setting recognition. Plain block-
letters are easiest cut, but style
can be put in without much
extra work. Remove sharpness
by filing cut edges.
No brand should be more
than 20 inches long. The letters
of the station brand can be
three to four inches high and
spaced for style. Class brands
smaller. Group fleece classes
together and sundry classes to-
gether ; numbers on one sheet.
Cobalt in N.Z.
“J.H.”: W. J. Robertson, of
Eltham (N.Z.), had considerable
trouble in getting his Jerseys
along, as may be judged from
the fact that by last Christmas
42 out of 75 cows were still
empty. Hearing of cobalt treat-
ment, Robertson dosed his cows
with cobalt at the rate of a
tablespoon to a 600-gallon
trough of drinking water once
a week, and he used about
of cobalt, following the usual
practice of first dissolving the
cobalt in warm (not hot) water.
For the first time in a lengthy
farming career Robertson has
the satisfaction of knowing that
every animal in his herd is in
calf.
As a contrast last season 22
of his cows failed entirely in this
respect. The herd sire was not
changed. Last year 21 cows
calved in August. This year
there will be 42, and a gain of at
least two months has been made
with a considerable section of
the herd. One cow aborted last
year, and indications were that
the same thing would happen
this year, so Robertson dosed
her with a simple drench of
water in which cobalt the size
of a pea had been dissolved. The
symptoms entirely disappeared,
and, with the time that has since
elapsed, prevention seems to
have been definite. Last year
£l5 was spent on various
“ What's that rumbling noise- thunder?”
veterinary remedies; this year
the expenditure was £1 Is. on
cobalt.
Noogoora Burr in S.A.
“Jock”: Before the opening
wool sales in Adelaide this year
growers inspecting their wool
saw fleeces from the .bottom
corner of Queensland carrying
Noogoora burr. This burr is
new to most S.A. sheepmen;
only one plant has, as yet, been
found in this State, at Ardrossan.
Department of Agriculture weed
experts took steps to prevent its
spread. S.A. has Californian
burr along the Murray, and
Noogoora burr would be an un-
welcome addition.
Wool carrying Noogoora burr
was valued at 50d., but the burr
reduced it to 30d. The pieces
which, if clean, would have made
20d. brought 2|d. The burr has
to be hand-picked from the
wool, and this greatly reduces
the price to the grower.
The economic loss S.A.
growers would suffer if the burr
got away in their State is thus
clearly shown, and it is hoped
precautions will be widespread.
Although the plant can be con-
trolled by the new hormonal
weed-killers in very low concen-
tration (| gallon per acre), each
mature plant may produce up
to 10,000 burrs, which will ger-
minate over three years, and a
few plants allowed to mature
could do untold damage. The
danger is that cattlemen, who do
not regard the burr as a nuis-
ance, will not take active mea-
sures against it.
Shoe Them Well.
“E.H.S.”: Although it is cus-
tomary to use cogged shoes on
draughthorses they are seldom
used on light animals. All
horses used for pack or saddle
work on hilly country should be
fitted with cogged shoes, as plain
shoes after a little wear have a
tendency to slip on steep grades,
particularly on clayey surfaces
after rain. A horse wearing
cogged shoes can negotiate
grades where one wearing the
ordinary plain plate would be
on the toboggan. When a horse
finds himself slipping on a steep
grade he becomes alarmed and
starts plunging, and when that
occurs it generally ends in dam-
age to himself and his cargo.
Clydesdales at Work,
“Agric”: It came as a sur-
prise to some at the annual
meeting of the Queensland divi-
sion of the Clydesdale Horse
Society to learn that although
the Fairymead Sugar Cos., Ltd.,
Bundaberg (Q.), probably owns
more tractors than any indi-
vidual or other company in the
State, it still owns 700 Clydes-
dale horses, and 500 of them are
continually employed in cultivat-
ing the company’s sugarcane-
farms.
The company sells all its
culled horses, and recently one
sold for £l6, and the agricul-
tural Staff officer (F. C. Lam-
bert) said it was a bad state of
affairs that people were now
talking of selling good Clydes-
dales for dog’s meat. Lambert
claimed that horses were much
cheaper and better than tractors
in the cultivation of certain
classes of soils, while for inter-
row cultivation the co. never
used tractors. The meeting was
discussing the future of the
Queensland division now that
membership had declined to 31,
as against 42 last year. The
president (A. G. Muller) said
that so many of the younger
men would not be bothered with
horses irrespective of whether
or not they paid better than trac-
tors. It was thought that it
would help to revive interest in
the horse if the Royal National
Association increased its prize-
money all round, particularly in
view of the depreciated value of
money today, as present prize
schedules did not encourage the
showing of horses. It was con-
sidered that it would be in the
national interest to revive in-
terest in the horse in view of
what is happening overseas, and
the possibility sooner or later
of petrol supplies being cut off.
The parent body in Melbourne
is to be asked to help revive in-
terest in the horse.
Dealing with Mice.
“Rusty Jack”: During a mice
plague we found the best de-
stroyer to be baits of a small
amount of strychnine mixed with
flour and baking-soda. Very
few Ot more than a couple of
yardsr (However, this idea is only
sheds and barns, away
from ! le |e house.
I ni cjie treacle-tin traps and
distribu ed them around in the
house. ! " t First I tried them with
water, out after meeting with
little success I left them dry and
the results were astounding.
Half-eaten mice in the trap
puzzled me, and one such I
found I poisoned, and was sur-
prised next morning to find all
mice in the trap dead. It was
obvious cannibalism.
Another scheme that worked
in a shed was to seal up all the
holes in the floor except one in
the middle of the room. With
an inch auger I made four holes
in the floor level, through the
walls, one at each corner. Out
of some tins I made chutes,
which I greased and nailed on
round the holes, outside the
building. Each one led down
into a bucket half-full of water.
At night I would go to the shed
and dozens of mice, bolting to
escape, would shoot down the
hole and into the water.
Irrigated Pastures.
“K.W.R.”: Carrying capacity
achieved in grazing tests on irri-
gated perennial pastures at the
Victorian Research Farm, Wer-
ribee, demonstrated the longev-
ity, continued high production
and resilience of this type of
pasture. An area, sown in 1917,
which suffered from restricted
water supply and subsequent re-
duced carrying capacity, emerged
from an adverse period with pro-
duction potential as high as ever.
When regular watering was re-
sumed in October, 1946, the
pasture was stocked at the rate
of 15 sheep per acre, and this

THE NEW LIQUID SHEEP DIP
incorporating “ Cammexam" Benzene HexacbJondt.
Containing the most effective isecti-
cide discovered for the purpose,
GAMALENE is a POSITIVE des-
troyer of keds (sheep ticks), body lice,
foot lice and blowflies. It remains
active in the wool long enough to
ensure the destruction of any eggs or
pupae which may not be eradicated at
the time of dipping.
Its high concentration means that 2\
gallons of GAMALENE will do the
same work for which at least 5 gallons
of ordinary liquid dip, or 100 lbs. of
powder dip, are required.
GAMALENE is one of the simplest
of alt dips to use, and possesses many
remarkable features which must recom-
mend it to every sheep owner.
• GAMALENE is a stable emulsion easy to pour and requires
no premixing before use.
• Contains no ingredients of an acid or caustic nature, no
mineral oils or solvents and cannot injure the wool.
• Is retained in the wool after dipping, and is not washed out
by rain.
• Highly concentrated, 2\ gallons of GAMALENE are
sufficient for 1000 gallons of wash.
Sickle Brand GAMAL ENE is packed in 10 pint tins —two per carton. One carton (2J gallons') is
sufficient to make 1000 gallons of wash.

rate was maintained until June,
1947.
Sheep numbers were reduced
to 10 per acre during winter, but
reverted to 15 per acre in
October, and were increased to
20 per acre in November, a rate
maintained until the present.
Sheep used were six-tooth
Romney-Merino cross ewes;
their fleeces averaged 111 b. and
sold at 51d. per lb. Aggregate
gain in liveweight per acre dur-
ing the past 16 months has ex-
ceeded 1001 b.
The pastures are dominated
by white clover and perennial
ryegrass, with cocksfoot, Ken-
tucky, bluegrass, prairie-grass,
subterranean and strawberry
clovers in lesser amounts.
Pasture-research officers point
out that sustained high produc-
tion over a number of years, plus
ability tb recover rapidly from
adverse conditions, are charac-
teristics of this plant-association
when encouraged with liberal
topdressing with superphosphate.
Hints for the Farm.
“Malo”: Since no seeds of
the new disease-resistant French
bean Windsor Longpod are
available for distribution as yet,
growers should try to evolve a
better type of bean by careful
selection of seed. Plants which
are capable of resisting blight
should be selected, and from them
only plants which bear heavy
crops of long, straight pods
should be chosen as seed stock.
The same plan should be fol-
lowed with regard to peas.
“Bai”: The prohibitive cost of
fertilisers should encourage
N. S. Wales farmers to form co-
operative societies for their pro-
duction as is being done in Vic-
toria. A factory near Geelong
has thousands of producers who
are also consumers. The annual
output is nearly 200,000 tons of
super, and the price is bedrock
cost.
“Nemo”: If the farm is in a
dry area you may have difficulty
in keeping your car-springs
lubricated to avoid squeak. Soak
cotton-waste with oil and force
it snugly in place between spring
and frame. Oil will be squeezed
from the waste by flexing of the
springs and will keep them lubri-
cated.
“Wilco”: When paspalum
mealy-bug shows up in a pas-
palum paddock the dying grass
should be burned. The fire
usually kills most of the bugs,
and a renovation with cultivator
or disc-plough may cause the
grass to come away with all its
former vigor. If the bugs cannot
be cleared out of the area the
only thing to do is to plough out
the paspalum and replant with
another grass.
“Ethel M.”: Vermin on poul-
try can be destroyed by spraying
the houses, nests and perches.
An effective disinfectant is made
by mixing together one part of
kerosene to five parts of boiling
soap-suds, to which a little sump-
oil has been added.
“Big Billy”: For black spot
in the flower garden, a spray of
Bordeaux mixture (3-4-50) or
copper oxychloride, lfoz. to
two gallons of water, will be
effective. If applied in the spring
to early growth, use a wetting
agent, and repeat several times
gt intervals of two weeks.
“Myrrhee”: Growing stock
need calcium for bone-making ;
breeding and milking animals
need it to enable them to trans-

BERT.
True to Form.
lhe Minister for Backing and
Filling, humble representative
of the downtrodden, toiling
masses, flicked a speck of dust
from his 20-guinea suit, then
punched the bell for his private
secretary.
When that official appeared
the Minister glanced impatiently
at the diamond-encrusted wrist-
watch that had been specially
imported for him by a colleague.
“It’s eleven o’clock —why isn’t
my limousine ’ere?” he barked
in that all-men-are-equal tone
which is the very quintessence of
that socialism he was so enthusi-
astically helping to fasten on the
people.
“I’m sorry, sir,” replied the
secretary with that fine disre-
gard of class distinction which
now marked the era of the
passing of the Old Order, “but
your chauffeur rang to say he
got a puncture just after he
dropped the children at college
this morning.
“As you know, sir, his union
has laid it down that it is not in
a chauffeur’s duties to change a
wheel —he’d be expelled as a
‘scab’ if he did. He has filled in
the necessary application form
to have the job done by the
Government garage. I have
signed it on your behalf and
sent it along to the departmental
chief clerk for counter-signature.
It will go for final approval to
the union secretary. If there is
no hitch final authorisation
should be complete by early this
afternoon.”
The Minister frowned. “This
is over the odds,” he said,
falling naturally into a jargon
with which circumstances had
for so long made him familiar.
“I got a most important ap-
pointment to look at a race-
’orse this mornin’, and”
“But what about that deputa-
“Wider, please.”
tion of factory executives whom
you’d arranged to see regarding
the drive for increased produc-
tion, sir?”
The statesman frowned again.
“They’ll ’ave to realise that a
triflin’ matter like production
can’t be allowed to ’old up a
vital matter like a racin’ trans-
action. Let ’em wait till I git
back. In the meantime order
the spare limousine at once.”
It was about two hours later
that the exalted representative of
the downtrodden masses, still
exuding an aroma of the stables,
dropped wearily into his plush-
lined swivel-chair and reached
for his box of double-Coronas.
“Very exhaustin’, that,” he re-
marked to his secretary, “ ’avin’
to ride in one o’ them old fluid-
drive Chryslers. Why! They
must be four years old! Been
rattled to pieces, I suppose, on
some o’ them important trips up
around the Barrier Reef. When
can I get me Buick?”
“You must have forgotten, sir.
Your wife has arranged to have
it this afternoon for a shopping
expedition around the furriers
for a set of Russian sables. By
the way, sir—a ring came from
Canberra asking that you fix up
a union affair.”
The Minister groaned. “What
is it this time?” he asked
morosely.
“Well, sir, it seems that yester-
day a Sydney wharfie was stand-
ing up against his barrow asleep
when a wheel came off it and
he nearly fell over. They held
a stop-work meeting and
threatened that if they’re not
paid ten shillings a week extra
danger-money for this new risk
they’ll tie up every ship in the
port. The Chief wants you to
see Healy.”
At the prospect of facing the
wharfies’ Commo leader the
Minister’s liver turned two
shades whiter. But he supposed
it would have to be done. Forti-
fying his flagging fibres with
four fingers of the best Scotch,
he dragged out of the office to
keep the dread assignment.
Surprisingly enough, in deal-
ing with this delicate situation
the Minister showed unusual
firmness —he flatly refused to
promise the wharfies more than
9s. 6d. extra danger-money.
But the following day came
the most dreaded of all compli-
cations. The Ironworkers’
Union claimed that by putting
the split-pin back in the axle of
his barrow the wharfie had done
work which should be done by
a member of the Ironworkers’
Union. It thus became an inter-
union demarcation dispute. At
stop-work meetings ironworkers
had demanded not only the right
to replace split-pins on wharf
barrows but also declared that
unless they got a £2 a week rise
and six weeks’ holiday a year
they’d paralyse all industry by
tying up all the steelworks.
The exalted rep. of the toiling
masses broke into a cold sweat
at this news. It meant he’d now
have to face two Commo union
leaders. He rang for his secre-
tary.
“Issue a press statement,” he
said. “If anything crops up I
can always say I was misre-
ported. Say I ’ope better coun-
s;|Tll prevail among the two
umjjyis an’ that I’ll call a con-
f’reiice —lemme see —on Thurs-
day the nineteenth.”
“jßut you’re going overseas
for that conference on the im-
pbrtation of canary-seed on the
eighteenth, sir,” began the sec-
retary.
Th)s Minister for Backing and
Filling looked hard at the under-
ling.
“So what?” he said tersely.

Figures
The Corporation of the City of
Adelaide is a socialistic body, operating
for the general good and not for profit —
rendering service and levying taxes with-
out fear or favor. It can therefore be
used as an economic guinea-pig by re-
searchers studying the relationship of
manpower, time and wages.
This year rates have been raised, and
every property-owner has received a
letter, accompanied by a chart, showing
why. The chart shows clearly that a job
of work which cost £lOO in 1933 now
costs £238. During the interval hours
have been shortened, holidays extended
and sick-leave granted. Each new amenity
has meant a reduction in the effectiveness
of the manpower employed, until the cost
to the community has been more than
doubled. There can be no doubt about
either the cause or the effect.
Theorists may claim that the shortening
of hours does not reduce production.
Practical accountancy proves that neither
the engineers nor the street-swdepers have
increased their pace to overtake the clock.
The time lost is service lost, even when
the people are the employers and the pay-
masters.
The corporation chart could be used to
demonstrate the cause of rising costs and
increasing shortages throughout Aus-
tralia—Citizen (S.A.).
Aircraft v. Railways
In the last 25 years I’ve travelled ex-
tensively by air and rail. My first flight
was from Brisbane to Sydney in the
Southern Moon, a sister-craft to the
Southern Cross and ill-fated Southern
Cloud. My latest was a few days ago
in a modern air-liner between the same
two cities.
To reach the airport in the old Fokker
days, you got to the ’drome under your
own power, there were no services or
meals on board, and most interest during
the trip was centred on the little paper
bags which a thoughtful management
pfovided.
On my recent trip I arrived outside
T.A.A. office in Brisbane about half an
hour before departure time (I’m not
singling out this concern; I have re-
ceived similar treatment at the hands of
A.N.A., Butler’s and Qantas). My bags
were whisked away, weighed and excess
luggage paid. I did not see them again
until I arrived at Phillip House, Sydney.
A comfortable bus took me to Eagle
Farm, where I boarded the liner. On the
journey a friendly hostess attended to my
requirements in the way of refreshments
and reading matter. At the appropriate
time a good cold lunch was placed in
front of me. At Mascot and Phillip
House there was the same attention as
in Brisbane.
Two days later I had to travel by
train. At Central Station porters were
so scarce that most passengers were
lugging their suitcases from the tram to
their trains. Meals at railway refresh-
ment rooms have to be experienced to
be believed. Some of the trains have
buffet services, but the service is casual
and the food poor.
Far from having improved over the
last decade, the services on our trains
have deteriorated, and the N.S.W.G.R.
seem prepared to sit down and take it
instead of improving their services to
enable them to compete with air-travel.
If the drift continues, our railways, into
which we have sunk so much capital,
will become merely carriers of goods,
and of non-paying articles at that.
The point is, of course, that the rail-
ways are a Government monopoly, while
the standard of air-travel was developed
hy private-enterprise competition. The
railways are a fair indication of what will
happen if private air-lines are forced out
of business, leaving the air to the Govern-
ment-owned concerns. —D. P. J. (N.S.W.).
Amateur Radio Licences
Before the P.M.G. rushes into print
praising his department’s work in
licensing 50 new amateur radio stations
Per month, he should listen on the 10-,
-0-, 40- and 80-metre amateur radio
bands to the useless frivolity discussed
between many “nitwits of the ether.”
Twenty years ago it was considered
an accomplishment to possess an amateur
radio “ticket.” One belonged to a select
band of radio experimenters who did
much to further international communica-
tion and goodwill. Close liaisons were
kept between the early experimenters and
the P.M.G. Department, which, though
strict with radio amateurs, did its best to
encourage them.
During the last two decades things
have been much easier for the young
amateur radio enthusiast. The main
qualifications for a “ticket” are to pass
an exam, and know the Morse code. De-
spite the advances in electronics the
exam, set today is little harder than in
1928. Any normal schoolboy with a
good knowledge of modem physics would
have little trouble in passing it.
The result is that hundreds of young-
sters, many of them still at school, are
being licensed to run amateur radio
stations. Although their licence stipulates
“for experimental use only,” they know
that P.M.G. radio inspectors will not en-
force that, and the ether is theirs to fool
around in as if they were playing in the
street.
A few years ago, it was necessary for
the young radio amateur to spend a six-
months probationary period on Morse.
This has now been lifted, allowing the
modern “experimenter” to “blurt” into
a mike, which means he is being heard
throughout the world and making a poor
“ Don't like ’em that big myself — flavor's too STRONG.”
advertisement for this country. The new
v.h.f. spectrum and the latest trend to-
ward single side-band communication,
frequency modulation, pulse transmission
and television offer unlimited scope to
make the exam, harder.
The pre-war standard, when amateur
radio’s ranks included some of the finest
radio laymen in Australia, and when Don
B. Knock’s column in The Bulletin was
read in every amateur radio “shack,”
can only be recaptured if the P.M.G.
pays much closer attention to the issuing
of amateur licences. — Waddlin’ Willie
(Vic.).
“No Children”
A check made of advts. for married
couples seeking or being offered work on
country properties was interesting. Of
20 “Situations-Vacant” announcements
three specified “no children,” 15 were dis-
creetly silent on the point, one graciously
added “child considered,” while one made
an offer to “take one child.”
The majority of those advertising for
positions hastened to make what seems
to be the proudest —in this respect, prob-
ably necessary—boast of the twentieth-
century Australian, “No Children.” Two
of them, however, had made the grave
economic blunder of reproducing their
kind, while one poor fellow confessed to
having three.
There may be some excuse for the “no-
children” attitude in overcrowded city
residentials and hotels, but if there is no
room for Australian children in the
country heaven help us. —G. McDonald
(N.S.W.).
Trees
Agreed that timber conservation is an
urgent need in Australia, and that more
adequate control is necessary (B.
29/9/’4B), but here’s another side of the
picture.
I bought land in the coastal district
near Sydney, in 1912, for a small farm,
but later decided to reserve it to allow
the young bush trees thereon to mature
to the marketable timber stage. The
trees have now grown and matured to the
timber stage, but the return is less than
would have been obtained by destroying
them all in the first instance and using
the land for grazing.
The best price obtainable is 3s. per
100 super, feet as standing timber and
12s. per 100 super, feet as logs at a
timber-mill three miles away where the
public is charged 525. per 100 super, feet
for sawn timber.
If the land is sold with the timber
standing, Land Sales Control will not
allow anything for the timber, nor is any
consideration for it included in the price
of the land. I have that on the
authority of “approved Government
valuers,” who speak of “virgin bush”
(most of the trees are grandmothers),
evidently under the delusion that to hold
money idle for 35 years or more and pay
shire rates is a reasonable thing for some-
one else.to do.
Apparently the Government does not
wish to encourage the conservation of
timber on alienated land. H. G.
(N.S.W.).
Trams and Spuds
N.S.W. folk have been irritated by the
cost of potatoes, though I don’t suppose
anybody eats a bob’s-worth in a week.
Meanwhile tram-fares have been in-
creased from 3s. to ss. per week by the
State Government. The increase in the
cost of spuds per head would hardly
represent threepence a week, but the in-
crease in tram-fares is anything from 2s.
up.
Potato-growers need as much as they
can get to bring them into line with in-
creasing costs of production, but they
are still paying their own way and, per-
haps, creating a reserve. On the other
hand the tramways are giving worse
service than ever, are dirtier than ever
and less reliable. There is talk of a million
pounds being handed to the tramways
from consolidated revenue.
Labor politicians don’t complain about
the bad transport service, or the heavy
cost to the taxpayer, but they rant about
potatoes which mean only a difference of
pennies and which, after all, are the best
value among our commodities.
Blunderland (N.S.W.).
White Australia
The view that there are millions of
Chinese ready and eager to vacate their
native rice-paddy for Australia doesn’t
find much support in China. Except for
those in large sea- or river-ports, such as
the Cantonese, there is no greater stay-
at-home stick-in-the-mud than the rural
Chinee. The teaching of Confucius,
placing the family and home as the first
filial duty, has been followed for over
2500 years and is now more of an heredi-
tary'instinct than an acquired one.
On the building of the 340-mile high-
way into the famine areas of Henyang
and Hunan, from Nanchang via Chang-
sha, labor had to be conscripted by the
tens of thousands to get the job done
in the specified three months. Many were
taken from their homes and sent to sec-
tions in other districts, but the number
of desertions, undiagnosed sicknesses and
deaths was so large that a new system
whereby the laborer worked close enough
to allow him to live at home had to be
adopted. Before that it was common to see
a dejected Chinee sitting on his haunches
at the roadside, the tears making tiny
rivulets down his dusty face while he
chanted mournfully “J-ya, J-ya, J-ya”
(home).
The ceding of extraterritorial rights
in China by the Allies, at Yalta, was
accepted by the Chinese as a definite sign
of weakness and was the cause of “loss
of face” for the whites in China. Hence
the slogans, printed in English and
Chinese, that adorned the sidewalks and
walls of buildings in Shanghai and other
Chinese cities —“We won the war,” “Out
with the foreigner,” “China for the
Chinese” are typical examples. Anti-
foreign riots were common at this time
(1947), and many whites were attacked
in the streets.
I was once the guest of a highly-
placed official in inland China. He was
an American University graduate and a
world traveller, but the only apparent in-
fluence of education was his ability to
speak good English. He received me in
an inner sanctum, and, over green tea
flavored with chrysanthemum flowers,
he chewed sunflower seeds and, in true
patient Oriental fashion, began to draw
me out. After the usual exchange of
flattering compliments, at which I ran a
very poor second, he switched to world
politics and, not unexpectedly, to the
White Australia policy. “Why don’t you
allow Chinese into your country?” he
asked.
I explained that the two countries were
as far apart in their ways of living, social
laws, religion and temperament as the two
poles. “Then,” he said, “you agree with
the great Kipling?” I nodded. “My
friend,” he continued, “I agree with you
both, yet the phrase ‘White Australia’
rankles. It was an unfortunate choice.”
—Randolph E. Bedford (Q.),
Volunteer Firemen
Placing N. S. Wales fire-stations on
the same basis as the police and other
public-service bodies (B. 13 /10/’4B) in-
stead of enlisting volunteers would only
lower country fire-fighting efficiency and
deprive many young men of a chance to
help in the preservation of their town or
city.
In every Victorian country towr*
volunteer firemen, headed by two
stationkeepers, fight fires wafflirigly and
are proi?d to wear the uniWm with their
town wove*-on the cowl Most of the
volunteers are single men in their early
twenties who speadytheir spare time
training, checking fire-fighting equipment
and studying the latest trends in fire
fighting.
The annual demonstration of the
country fire brigades held in different
cities and towns early in the New Year
is one of the State’s most keenly-contested
gatherings. Some records are con-
stantly being broken, while others have
stood for quarter of a century. Weeks
before, every volunteer fireman trains
after work to a degree of precision and
efficiency rarely achieved by professional
firemen. — Jay (Vic.).
“The Bad Old Days”?
“Gumsucker” (B. 29/9/’4B) draws a
miserable picture of the 1890 slump—l’ve
heard the tale told better by my Dad.
Strange, though, that he appeared to have
no recollection of those soup hand-outs
or that “eight-o’clock rush.” By the same
token, when I’m telling my son about the
1930’s I won’t be able to throw much
light on the dole —it didn’t exist for me.
Listening to the old chap and his mates
reliving those hard days, I glimpsed a
picture of mateship, of life on the track
and on the diggings ; a picture of hard
men living hard, enduring heartbreaking
toil for little recompense, taking each
day as it came, asking for nothing that
they couldn’t earn and ever ready to share
a turn of luck with a mate or acquaint-
ance ; big-hearted, hard-handed, sturdy
miners, shopkeepers and farmers —a
motley collection of mates.
I worked my way through the last
slump. I entered that depression with
high hopes, good prospects and a healthy
bank account. I emerged from it with
an empty purse, no future worth talking
about and complete confidence in my
ability to handle any situation that might
arise. I struck hard times. I missed
meals. I worked sometimes for tucker,
sometimes for a pair of boots. I wouldn’t
want to see those times repeated. But I’m
thinking now of what I’ll remember most
when my son asks me what sort of days
they were.
I worked hard and long in those days
to earn a pound, but I could tell you
accurately what a host of things could be
bought with that money. I’ll tell my son
how trams and trains ran regularly, how
electricity and gas were never rationed,
how stores were full of well-made goods,
and how you could buy whatever you
wanted, provided you had the money.
Admittedly that was hard to come by, but
when you had it you could use it.
I don’t want to see that depression
again, but I’d sell all my shares in this
Golden Age for the freedom, the mate-
ship, the clear outlook and half the in-
centive that I knew in the 1930’s. — River
Road (W.A.).

GOLDEN opportunity ! When the steel industry’s expansion
at Port Kembla, N.S.W., takes shape many opportunities
will be created for those ambitious to progress in life.
The immense nature of the project developed by Australian
Iron & Steel Ltd. and The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd.
is indicated by the illustration above. It shows the proposed
hot and cold strip mills and tinplate plant superimposed in plan
form in the position they are to occupy in relation to the
Australian Iron &. Steel Ltd. Kembla Works (in middle distance).
The new plant will require a million cons of steel ingots
per annum, involving the doubling of the present steel ingot
capacity of the A.I.S. Kembla Works. It will provide an assured
