Malthoid has found special favor with architects and builders and all who have ever used
it. The ease with which it is fixed, the satisfactory appearance and lack of roofing
troubles for ever after, together with the economy effected in its use, are all factors of its
universal popularity. For big city flat roofs, factories, modern bungalows and all other
buildings, Malthoid is unexcelled.

“Nerves”
Our nerves are similar to an intri-
cate network of telegraph wires.
Controlled and nourished by a
portion of the brain —known as
the nerve centres —the delicate
threadlike nerves radiate in all
directions throughout the body.
So long as the nerve centres are
capable of continually supplying
nourishment to the nerves, the
nerves will remain strong and
healthy. But directly the nerve
centres become weakened by
overwork, worry or anxiety, they
are unable to transmit the
necessary nourishment, and the
nerves become worn out and
“on edge.” Then it is that a sud-
den sound makes you “ jump ”
—you get irritable—you suffer
from neuralgia—you are rest-
less and depressed. In this con-
dition there is nothing to equal
nm
The Wiae of Lire

food, ‘ Wincarnis ’ gets right to
the root of the trouble, and, by

force, stimulates and revitalises
the whole nervous system. Try

The Mouth is the Gateway for the
Entrance of Disease.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no fewer
than 38 different infections may be traced with more
or less directness to the human mouth as a focal or
starting point, the mouth being the gateway for
the entrance of disease; therefore it is here that the
fight must begin to keep the enemy out.

Care like a feather,
Good wine to pi ease —
We two together '
Shall take our ease ;
For life, I swear,
Were little worth
If toil and care
Ruled all the earth ;
The world is ours,
The day is young,
With fruits and flowers
Time's tree is hung,
And, whether we like it
- Or like it not,
The flowers must fade
And Ae fruit must rot!
Boon friends together
With nought to chill,
Of wind and weather
We’ll talk our fill;
Vc-t this we know,
Say what we may,
The winds will blow
Their own sweet way ;
And, whether we like it
Or like it not,
N.S.W.
The rain will fall
And the sun shine hot
With Pleasure smiling
The livelong day,
And Leisure whiling
The hours away,
In sunlight brave,
’Neath heaven’s blue
Great talks we’ll have
Of war, we two ;
Yet, whether we like it
Or like it not,
Talk’s only talk—
Not powder and shot.
Grown melancholy
We’ll muse, we twain,
On human folly
And human pain,
On stars that fall*
And lives amiss,
And from it all
We’ll glean but this —
That, whether we like it
Or like it not,
The round world cares
No tittle or jot!
RODERIC QUINN.
A Handbook of Insurrection
The Insurgent’s Manual and Handbook of
Insurrection, published in 1910, and the first
edition liable to be sold out at any moment,
is a work which everybody should buy as
soon as he can get it. The writer, who uses
the pen-name of Napoleon Schmidt, claims
to have insurreeted in various countries and
to have an inside knowledge of the game.
He adds that, by reason of the present pro-
llun agitation in Australia he has hopes of
employment.
A rising, he holds, should be nominally
about something, or preferably about several
things so as to gather in diverse interests,
but it shouldn’t be about too many things,
for then it may gather in too many interests.
The worst failure is the unanimous rising of
everybody to plunder themselves. The next
worst failure is the rising of a great many
people to plunder very few people. The ideal
s the upheaval of a few to loot many. Very
Aw, if they are well armed, well organised
and well led, will suffice, and they are more
easily handled. He quotes the Mauchus in
China, the Terrorists in France, Cromwell’s
army of Independents, and oxer 79 ovti '-in-
stances, and njO-vnates that 5 per cent, of
thi mVA:-uodicd male population is sufficient.
A time comes when the leader must explain
what the upheaval is about if it is about
anything. Then it is well to have the small-
est possible number to explain to and the
smallest number to disappoint by throwing
their ideals overboard. Naturally, also,
there is a chance of the salaried billets going
round better.
As regards the choice of leaders Napoleon
Schmidt believes that they shouldn’t be
chosen, because that makes the selectors
self-important. They should just happen.
The case, however, is one where cir-
cumstances must decide. Sometimes there
is one head who may be the real head or
only a “ghost,” to use a literary term. Some-
times there are several or many heads, of
whom one is real and the rest think they
are. These latter require to be secretly
assassinated after success has been achieved,
and the blame laid on anybody belonging
to the suppressed party who looks as if
hanging would be good for him,- for the
loader who thought he was and found he
wasn’t is irreconcilable. Sometimes the
position is complicated by the fact that the
real leader finds, when all the hard work is
finished, that there is a still more real person
hitherto invisible in the background. Then
prompt murder is imperative. The writer
has a supreme contempt for Garibaldi, the
brilliant soldier who had ideals, who made
no money and got no office and had no lobt
to divide with his followers, and who, after
wasting his life in the effort to create an
Italian republic, was reduced by ill-managed
circumstances to be the unpaid pilot-fish for
an Italian king. Above him he puts Simon
Bohvar, also with ideals, also a brilliant
soldier always risking his life in the front
rank, but with sense enough to grab supreme
power at the finish. Higher still he ranks
Benito Juarez, brave enough but always
planning and contriving in the background
and sending his well-chosen lieutenants to
the front, yet holding the supreme authority
after the triumph with a grasp that no
lieutenant could shake.. Cromwell he dis-
misses because he started as an idealist and
always pretended to remain one, thus bring-
ing an honorable profession into discredit by
hypocrisy.
In organising a rebellion it is sometimes
well to capture an existing organisation—
the Trades Hall. The Jesuits, the Shakspeare
Society if it is numerous enough—as a
nucleus. If it is possible not to let it know
that it is captured so much the better. A
serious risk, however, is that the nucleus
may find itself out and get swelled head.
The finest upsetting of a Government was
the. recent one in Portugal. There was no
visible nucleus; no apparent head or tail,
no talk, and no declared leaders. The poor
and dissatisfied country was honeycombed by
somebody with revolutionary groups. Each
member of a group, save one, knew only his
fellow-members, so his chances of treachery
were limited. The exception knew a man in
the group above him, so his chances of treach-
ery were still limited. One man at the top
could have betrayed the lot, but nobody
offered him enough money. Among those who
emerged to form u new Government after the
monarchy was disposed of was presumably
the real man at the top, but he never alluded
to the fact. It doesn't appear that he made
much out of it, but such a silent person
might make a lot in secret.
A good time for starting operations is
when a new Parliament is being sworn in.
Then it is possible to capture and imprison
the monarch or viceroy with his cocked hat

Ploughing.
The brown earth ripples from the discs,
Brown hands are on the reins,
A faint, sweet steam ascending spreads
Above the line of nodding heads
Tossing their braided manes.
The keen wind blows, the white clouds sail.
The ripples run a’ong.
And thrilled with brimming ecstasy
A careless magpie warbles free
liis full, exultant song.
Gaily along the rolling slopes
Sunlight and shadow roam,
As though Demeter laughs in glee.
Thinking how soon that furrowed sea
Shall break in golden foam.
And stooping from the azure heights,
Their ivory limbs aglenm,
Along the dazzling hills of cloud,
The gods their studious brows have bowed
To watch the pacing team.
No perfume richer with delight
Their wisdom can devise;
And so they glean, to mend their dearth,
The wholesome savor of the earth
To sweeten paradise.

Columbine.
I sat alone in my musty room
In the still, dark night with my shattered
dreams,
When I heard a voice" in the trembling
gloom
Through the airy drift that the midnight
streams;
“Let me in! Let me in to the light again
From the wind and wail of the beating
rain!”
I oped the door and I looked outside
With the sob of years in my broken heart.
“Oh, my Columbine, is it .you,” I cried,
“Coming back to the world with your love
and art:
When your stage is dark and the curtain
down
And the white moths thick in your crumpled
gown?”
She raised her pinched little painted face
With a grave, slow smile and her soft mouth
said:
“Let me dance one step in this warm, small
place,
For my heart grew sick with the weary dead
When I heard you call; and I took my cue
From the sad, sad thoughts that were blind-
ing you.”
I drew her into the candle glow.
With her tinselled frock and her worn, silk
shoes.
And I said: “Be quick, for the light is low
And there’s barely a tip of the time to lose.
I will tap my soul for the old, old tune
That your Harlequin loved by the mad,
white moon.”
She stood tiptoe on the shadowy floor.
With a pirouette and a smile she turned;
But in faint fell down at the open door
As the light and herself in smoke out-burned.
And I wept alone in the night-tide black
With the thoughts and dreams that had
brought her back.
Alas! alas for an old romance;
For the heart of Youth and a love long dead;
For the dancing feet and the eyes’ down-
glance
Of a Columbine in her spangles red !
For an old romance is a new regret
When a maiden’s heart cannot quite forget.

ZORA CROSS.
The Claw.
In Papua when the night was high
I dreamed of Peace, and with a cry,
Turning, looked upward to the sky
And saw,
Not Peace the Fair,

The Tide-mark.
Here is the mark that the tide made
Ere, turning about,
The flow became ebb, and the waters
Went stealthily out.
Shells and waste things of the currents
Lie strewn on the sand ;
Brown weeds, torn and tossed by sea-turmoil,
And borne to the land.
Thus and no farther the effort,
The onset, attained;
For a Power that is lord of the waters
Controlled and restrained.
In a little, a day or, it may be,
A day and a night,
This flotsam, these shells, shall be buried,
And hidden from sight.
For the wind blows, the sand creeps, and ever
At work on the shore,
The wind and the sand through all seasons
Make clean and restore.
Oh. the beauty and order of Nature,
Her mercies and care!—
For the harm that was done by the waters
These twain shall repair.
Singing loud in their orbits, the wonders
That shine round us tell
That the Power that rules over the watprs
Rules nations as well.

THURSDAY, JULY 18, 1918.
A CITY AND A CACTUS.
A protest has been entered by some of the
people who live in N. S. Wales, north and
south of Sydney, against the unspeakable
policy which prevents them having cheap
and convenient access to the world’s markets
through their own good harbors —the mediae-
val-minded infamy wffiich keeps these harbors
closed or partly useless for lack of railway
connections, and by other devices. It wasn’t
a very >oud complaint, for, thanks to the
devices for dragging everything to Sydney,
there are, ofitside Sydney, only about three
people, including the baby, to each square
mile for protesting purposes,
and three people, including
the baby, can’t dissent much.
Incidentally, disrespectful
things were said about the
Ma State railway system,
which, if the map is turned
sideways, looks wonderfully
like a cactus, with a big root
in Sydney and a small one,
of no account at Newcastle,
and 4000 miles of tangled
branches waving in the
air above the Sydney root.
(At Newcastle there are
few facilities for loading
wheat, and the export of
wool was lately prohibited
by a regulation re “appraise-
ment.”) If every line had a
connection with the nearest good port,
whether it be Sydney or Port Stephens
or Twofold Bay or Jervis Bay, and each port
had a fair deal, the symmetry of the cactus
would be ruined. And, apropos the cactus
question, the Australian capital received a
mention because Jervis Bay is supposed to
be its outlet —that capital which is almost
as forgotten as Nineveh. It had its origin
in greed, fraud, hypocrisy, malice, narrow-
mindedness, parish-souled bigotry, anti-Aus-
tralian sentiment, treachery, meanness,
lobbying, shufiling, lying, conspiracy, abase-
ment to the interests of the Foreign-trade
and largely German importing push, and
most other things that are dirty. _ It began
badly, and then the cactus killed it.
* * * *
The story of that capital is too long to be
recited again in full detail. Parices and Reid.
both of N. S. Wales and both anti-Federal-
ists at heart, realised about the same time
that there was a growing Federal sentiment
and that the parochial horse might be the
wrong horse, and it became a race between
Reid (in office) and Parkes (out of office)
to snatch the opportunity. Reid arrived first,
hence the Convention and the first Draft
Constitution. The other States had to wait
for N. S. Wales, because for 30 years the Ma
State politicians had refused to have any-
thing to do with Federal proposals coming
from other States, so the two least deserving
among those connected with the movement
had the sprint for the glory to themselves.
The terms of the bargain were that the Con-
stitution was to be submitted to the people,
and if each State gave a majority for “Yes”
and the “Yes” t r ote reached a certain num-
ber (50,000 in N.S.W.) the measure was to
pass. But apparently Premier Reid again
began to imagine that the parish-minded
horse was the one to back.- So one of his
followers introduced a Bill raising the re-
quired “Yes” vote to 80,000, and Reid
refused to call on his party to support his
and the State’s solemn agreement, and he
voted against the Bill once and for it after-
wards. and N. S. Wales stood out. Also,
though Reid expressed no objection to the
Constitution at the Convention, he took the
stump against it with amazing energy. The
result of the first referendum, so far as N. S.
Wales was concerned, was that the “Yes”
vote was thousands ahead of the “No” vote,
yer it was disqualified by the perjured dodge
which raised the required minimum from
50,000 to 80,000. So Reid had backed the
wrong horse again, for though it was pos-
sible to disqualify the “Yes” majority at
the referendum it couldn’t be disqualified at
the approaching general election. Character-
istically the great “Yes-No” found a way
out. He made an offer to the other Premiers
to take a new view of things and support
the great cause of union if N. S.
Wales had the Federal • capital fixed
within its borders, and the scheme worked.
The fly in the ointment was the counter-
demand that the Commonwealth should have
at least 100 square miles of its own to put
its metropolis on. This was gall and worm-
wood to the small-souled crowd, which had
conjured up visions of putting the capital
on a few acres of ground at Redfern.
* * * *
The selection of Dalgety as the capital of
Australia was more gall and wormwood to
the anti-Australian push of N. S. Wales —
or rather of Sydney. The objections which
couldn’t be avowed were that: (1) it had a
good port behind it; (2) that it had a fast,
strong, ever-flowing mountain river along-
side it; and (3) that a big city might grow
there, which, by reason of the water-power
and the consequent facilities for cheap manu-
facturing might rival the State capital. The
avowed objections were: (1) that the site
was really in Victoria, which was a lie, for
the maps showed it to be in N. S. Wales;
(2) that it was nearer Melbourne than Syd-
ney, which was also a lie according to the
maps; (3) that it was “contrary to the
spirit of the Constitution,” whatever form of
alcohol that might be. When Dalgety was
repealed and Canberra was chosen the old
Sydneyites exulted greatly. The other
States, being disqualified as possible capital
sites, retained very little interest in the
matter, and N. S. Wales, which was really for
this purpose the Foreign-trade element of
Sydney, ran the show. Canberra had
notable features. It was badly watered.
It was to draw its water supplies from an
obscure stream which lay below the proposed
city level, for, unlike Dalgety, Canberra
stood at the top of an elevation instead of
half-way up, so no river could flow down to
it. The stream was so small that, in its
widest part, the photographer was wont to
plant his camera in the middle of it. A
rather expensive supply, sufficient for a
small town, might be brought by gravitation
from a distance, but the supply for a big
town would have to be pumped up at huge
cost by coal-power, and the coal would have
to be brought from afar off at great cost.
The local rainfall was poor and the fertility
moderate. Here it was proposed to allot
an area so small that the capital of all Aus-
tralia —the only capital of a continent in
the world or in history—would have to de-
pend on the charity
of the N. S. Wales
Government for
any water at all.
If the Australian
Parliament wasn’t

vient to the legisla-
tors at Sydney its

be cut off. The idea was so gro-
tesque that a slight enlargement of
the territory was allowed. It was also
agreed with reluctance that there should be
a Federal seaport at Jervis Bay, so that the
capital would have its own outlet to the
world. The port was to be connected with
the Federal city by a railway—an addition
to the N. S. Wales railway system—but the
line never eventuated, for it would have
spoiled the arrangement of the cactus design.
The terras offered by the N. S. Wales Gov-
ernment were that the Commonwealth should
have a bit of land at the bay just about the
size of a fishing village ; that the Federal sea-
port should be wholly dependent on the
charity of the State of N. S. Wales for its
water supply, having no catchment area of
its own; and that no ships should ever
come to the Federal port, for the concession
was to end at high-water mark, sb that ves-
sels couldn’t reach it except by trespassing
on State territory, and even then they would
have to be hauled up by bullocks.
* * * *
The obvious purpose of it all was (1) that
the capital should not by any chance ever
overshadow Sydney; (2) that its meanness
should symbolise the contempt of the old
parish-minded gang for the whole idea of
Federation; (3) that it should be a loss
instead of a profit, for being common pro-
perty any profit would have to be shared
among all the States; and (4) that what
trade it possessed should necessarily go to
Sydney per medium of the N. S. Wales rail-
ways. And the scheme worked admirably.
The Federal city is a place that nobody goes
to Its central town, Canberra, when last
heard of (and it isn’t often heard of) had
an estimated population of 116, though the
Australian Year Book puts the population
down at nothing whatsoever, which is doubt-
less an error. It struggles along with one
mail per day. The whole Federal Territory,
which is the shape of a bullock’s liver, has a
population of three (3) persons to the
square mile, which is less than the average
for N. S. Wales as a whole; and most of
these people are supported in one way or
another by Government money. It lies on,
or rather it doesn’t lie on but off, an unpay-
able branch line which is a mere lengthy
twig of the cactus railway system, and this
branch ends at the well-meaning village of
Nimmitabel (wrongly spelled Nimitybelle, as
a rule, but nobody seems to think the spell-
ing matters), containing 892 people. The
Federal port, despite its splendid deep-water
facilities, is about as busy as Tyre and
Sidon. Carefully cultivated isolation has
killed them both. Yet the fact remains that
the capital of a continent, with a big area
of land whereof the people would be sole
ground landlords for ever, would be a great
place, yielding a great revenue from ground
rents, and furnishing a great lesson in land
nationalisation, if it hadn’t been for its
drawbacks. These were that the site was
carefully selected with a view to making it
a mere disreputable pauper and back yard,
a sink for money, a parody on the Federal
idea, and a standing evidence that public
land ownership is a failure. The Labor party,
which is supposed to believe in public -land
ownership, had a choice, when the selection
was being made, of serving its principles or
serving the old .gang of city landlords, capi-
talists, Tories, importers, anti-Federalists
and incurable parochialists. It made the
wrong choice as usual, and missed the ’bus.
As a ’bus-loser it holds the record. Now it
might catch at least one vehicle by selling
Canberra and starting on sane principles—
big principles—on a site that isn’t quite so
discredited.
THE DRAMATIC AND ELOCU-
TIONARY GOVERNMENT.
People with a taste for art are generally
agreed that the present N.S.W. Premier is
a good-looking man. Still he wants a larger
countenance. The one that has served him
so far isn’t spacious enough to hold the ex-
pression of child-like amazement which'
comes over it when Holman learns that the
Cornstalk people are not wholly satisfied
with the best of all possible financiers —
which financier is him. reluctantly admitted
to be the best by himself. And in this aspect
of bewilderment the eminent political actor
and elocutionist is ably backed up by his
colleague B’itzpatrick. The general com-
plaint is that the Dramatic and Elocution-
ary Labor Ministries which were either
mostly Holman or all Holman have run up
the State’s expenses in round figures from
£14,000,000 to £21,500,000 per annum in-
side eight years, and that the process goes
on faster as time passes. W. H. Holman,
when he has finished staggering under this
evidence of public ingratitude, asks if it is
proposed to cut down the outlays on matters
of health, agriculture and education. The
increase under these headings amounts to
about one-third of the total increase. And
though the amounts spent on education are
reasonable, the latest returns showed N.S.W.
to be a poor fourth among the six States for
educational results, according to the custom-
ary reading and writing test, and neither
agriculture nor health expound any unusual
results. Therefore it might be pertinent to ask
if money isn’t being fooled away by bad man-
agement even in these highly deserving lines of
business.
« * * *
Holman’s child-like attitude is that
if the outlay, whether it is £2 or £2,000,000,
is charged to some deserving object, then the
outlay should be above suspicion and beyond
inquiry, and on the very day that he took
up this impregnable position news arrived
that he had appointed another £6OO-per-year
official in London to do something hazy about
“trade,” which is the art of buying things
in England that we can’t pay for, or pre-
tending to sell things in England when we
haven’t ships to deliver them. Holman’s
other attitude consists in mentioning three
or four small carefully-selected items of pos-
sible extravagance, and stating with a .tall
scoff that they are “mere bagatelles.” Which
is quite correct; even if a million pounds is
stolen or mislaid it is a mere forty million
bagatelles of fid. each, and sixpence is neither
here nor there. And Holman’s latest atti-
tude is that he has a business man—which
presumably means another salary for a
friendly person—searching the Public Ser-
vice for superfluous employees and anti-
quated and costly methods, and other items
of loss. The State pays three Commissioners
at £lOOO a year each and 34 subordinates
to see that the Public Service is efficiently and
economically managed: and it pays Holman
and Fitzpatrick and others for the same
purpose; and now Holman’s unspecified
acquaintance has been employed to find out
how useless and extravagant all these ex-
pensive persons have been, and it only wants
the appointment of another person to super-
vise and inspect Holman’s unspecified
acquaintance to make the business complete.
The Dramatic and Elocutionary Govern-
ment holds that it has answered all possible
objections when, yielding reluctantly to pub-
lic clamor, it appoints still one more func-
tionary to find out where the money went
after the money is gone. Fitzpatrick
assumes two aspects. He says that his
critics complain of waste and seldom specify
the exact items they complain of. Of course
they might give more details if they could
burgle the public offices and dynamite the
strong-rooms so as to get access to official
papers, and also visit the offices in working
hours and cross-examine the staffs. This
other aspect is a frank acknowledgment that
there really are far more public employees
than are necessary, and Fitz. seems proud
of making this belated discovery after the fact
had been frequently mentioned to him.
Incidentally, being driven into a corner, he
has dropped on to a loss of £16,000 or
£20,000 a year in superfluous printing alone,
which is a rare instance of the Elocutionary
Government finding out anything without
the aid of a Board. It is indeed rare, for the
Government, with the mental resources of
the Treasury, the Public Works (including
the Government Architect), the Housing
Board, the P.S. generally and the local
member with a free railway pass to
carry them to the scenes of trouble,
and' the local mayor and corporation
to advise, has an expensive Board at Work
to find out why housing accommodation
is scarce in mining districts. Outraged
Public Opinion knocks at the door, and the
Dramatic and Elocutionary Government’s
first idea, while in bed composing a master-
piece of oratory, is to organise a high-priced
department to open the door and ask Public
Opinion what it wants.
THE BATTLE OF THE WAZZIR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Brigadier-General Anderson", giving evidence before
a Select Committee of the Federal Senate last week
said: “A leading citizen of the Empire told me
when I was in London that it would have been better
if we had let the Waza in Cairo burn, for we would
have done more good in 24 hours than the British
Government had done in 24 years.”
If ole Pharaoh, King uv Egyp’, ’ad been
gazin’ on the scene
’E’d ’ave give the A.I.F. a narsty name
When they done their little best to scrub ’is
dirty kingdom clean,
An’ to shift ’is ancient ’cap uv sin and
shame.
An’ I’m tippin’ they’d ’ave phenyled 'im, an’
rubbed it in ’is ’ead.
But ole Pharaoh, King uv Egyp’, ‘e is dead.
So yeh don’t ’ear much about it; an’ it isn't
meant yeh should,
Since ’is Kingship wusn’t there to go orf pop ;
An’ this mishunery effert fer to make the
’eathen good
Wus a contract that the fellers ’ad to drop.
There wus other pressin’ matters, so they
’ad to chuck the fun.
But the Battle of the Wazzir took the bun.
Now, Ginger Mick ’e writes to me a long
ixcited note;
An’ ’e writes it in a whisper, so to speak;
Fer I guess the Censor’s shudder was across
’im as ’e wrote,
An’ ’e ’ad to bottle things that mustn’t leak.
So I ain’t got orl the strength uv it; but
sich as Ginger sends
I rejooce to decent English fer me friends.
It wus part their native carelessness, an' part
their native skite ;
For they kid themselves they know the Devil
well,
’Avin met ’im, kind uv cash’ul, on some wild
Orstralian night—
Wine an’ women at a secon’-rate ’otel.
But the Devil uv Orstralia ’e’s a little woolly
sheep
To the devils wot the desert children keep.
So they mooches ’round the drink-shopS, an’
the Wazzir took their eye,
An’ they found ole Pharaoh’s daughters
pleasing Janes ;
An’ they wouldn’t be Orstralian lest they
give the game a fly... .
An’ Egyp’ smiled, an’ totted up ’is gains.
’E doped their drinks, an’ breathed on them
’is agbd, evil breath....
An’ more than one woke up to long fer death.
When they wandered frum the newest an’
the cleanest land on earth.
An’ the filth uv ages met ’em, it wus ’ard.
For there may be sin an’ sorrer in the
country uv their birth;
But the dirt uv cenchuries ain’t in the yard.
They wus children, playin’ wiv an asp, an’
never fearin’ it.
An’ they took it very sore when they wus bit.
First, they took the tales fer furphys when
they got around the camp.
Uv a cove done in fer life wiv one night's
jag;
But when the yarns grew ’ot an’ strong an
bore the ’all-mark stamp
Uv dinkum oil, they waved the danger flag.
An’ the shudder that a clean man feels when
’e’s su’prised wiv dirt
Gripped orl the camp reel solid ; an’ it urt.
Young Bill wus only one uv ’em to fall to
Eastern sin:
Ev’ry comp’ny ’ad a rotten tale to tell.
An’ there must be somethin’ doin’ when the
strength uv it sunk in
To a crowd that ain’t afraid to clean up ’ell.
They wus game to take a gamble; but this
dirt dealt to a mate.
Well, it riled ’em; an’ they didn’t ’esitate.
’Ave yeh seen a crowd uv fellers takin'
chances on a game.
Crackin’ ’ardy while they thought it on the
square?
’Ave yeh ’eard their ’owl of anguish when
they • tumbled to the same,
’Avin’ found they wus the victims uv a
snare?
It wus jist that sort uv anger when they
fell to Egyp’s stunt.
An’, remember, they wus trainin’ fer the
front.


I ‘ave notions uv the Wazzir. It’s as old
as Pharaoh's tomb;
It’s as cunniu’ as the oldest imp in ’ell;
An’ the game it plays uv lurin’ blokes, wiv
love-songs, to their doom
Wus begun when first a tart ’ad smiles to
sell. .
An’ it stood there thro’ the ages; an it
might be standin’ still, ,
If it ’adn’t bumped a clean cove name o
Bill.
An’ they done it like they doilc it when a
word went to the push
That a nark ’oo’d eroded a pal wus run to
ground. • .
They done it like they done it when the blokes
out in the bush . ,
Passed a telegraft that cops wus nosm
round.
There wus no one rung a fire-bell; but the
tip wus passed about;
An’ they fixed a night to clean the Wazzir
out.
Yes, I’ve notions uv the Wazzir. It’s been
pilin’ up it’s dirt
Since it mated wiv the Devil in year One;
An’ spawned a brood uv evil things to do a
man a ’urt
Since the lurk uv snarin’ innercents begun.
But it’s sweeter an’ it’s cleaner since one
wild and woolly night
When the little A.I.F. put up a fight.
Now, it started wiv some ’orseplay. If the
’eads ’ad seen the look,
Dead in earnest, that wus underneath the
fun,
They’d ’ave tumbled there wus somethin
that wus more than commin crook,
An’ ’ave stopped the game before it ’arf

THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Poor Excuse that is Better than
None.
It is indeed a poor excuse that is worse
than no excuse at all. Incidental to that
proposition, complaint has been made for a
long, long time that Sydney ought to be con-
solidated under one municipal government.
The 41 municipalities which constitute the
city and immediate suburbs seem too many.
They represent one mayor (Lord or plain),
one set of aldermen, one town clerk, one town
hall and one set of officials and set of books
and debt and deficit and corporation road-
roller to every 19,000 people or thereabouts.
Some of the fractions are so small that there
is a deficit and a road-roller and the whole
box of tricks to so few people as hardly to
amount to anybody. The superfluous insti-
tutions not only waste money which is
wanted for road-metal, but they actually pre-
vent the earning of money. There are long,
narrow, crooked thoroughfares of little value
in proportion to their size, and looking like
worm-holes in an apple, which it would pay
to resume bodily with all their shanties and
dilapidations. In fact it is easy to imagine
them paying 10 per cent, in cash and a lot
more in beauty on the outlay, for there is
much unearned increment in turning a pro-
longed alley of a dog’s-hind-leg shape into
such a boulevard as Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. But the track which requires regen-
eration may wander through five self-govern-
ing districts, and the one in the middle may
have neither money nor credit, and the one
between it and the other end may refuse on
principle to co-operate with the one at the
end, and the one at the end may refuse to
consider any scheme that isn’t strictly its
own, and the one between the middle and
this end may fail to see that improvement is
necessary, and the one at this end may fancy
that the whole business is a scheme to under-
mine local institutions or Protestantism, or
something. Saying nothing of the dissen-
sions of the place at the back and the belief
of the place at the front that part of its
territory is going to be annexed, it is plain
that little can be done. For these and other
reasons there has been for at least 24 years
an intention to do something, and the Hol-
man Ministry proposes at last to move in
the matter. Wherefore, a poor excuse being
better than none, 31 municipalities whose
mayors and mayoral rabbit-skin robes are
threatened with obliteration have held deep
research at Petersham and resolved that it
would be “unwise and inopportune’’ to do
anything—
in view of the urgent need for the concentration
of the whole of the energies of the Government and
people upon matters vital to the successful prosecu-
tion of the war, and of possible political and
economic changes as a result of the present world-
wide changes.... Such a contentious matter....
should not be brought before Parliament until after
peace has been proclaimed.
Some people might suggest that the State
Government isn’t prosecuting the war—it
isn’t even prosecuting Hun agents very
much. And as its loan-spending activities
are curtailed through lack of loans, and it
ain’t spend all its days appointing Boards
of Trade, it really wants some work to keep
it warm. If it does this job right now it
will have its hands free to deal with those
political and economic changes” which are
to “result” from the present disturbance—
that is to say, they are not here now, but
ate to come after peace is achieved, when
they will naturally create a busy time. If
peace isn’t achieved—that is to say, if the
Hun wins—it is certainly better for him to
capture and execute one mayor than 41 on
the day of occupation. And if the Hun
Domes in the middle of this great and essen-
tial work it is nobler for Premier Holman
to be found at his post, like the Roman
soldier who was frizzled at Pompeii, doing
ms duty and abolishing superfluous mayors,
than to be discovered procrastinating in his
last moments. Man can only die once,
which is a nuisance, for if he could die
as . often as he liked he wouldn’t so much
mind dying once.

Ihe Great Australian Megaphone.
It is long odcls against Prime Minister
Hughes hurrying back to Australia. If the
truth must out he doesn't want to return
—and YY . S. Gilbert has a word or two
about that in “The Mikado.” Australia’s
anxiety to hear that he has gone arises
from inherent hostility to Czars and
muddlers. _ Thus comes the frequent yarn
about setting an Australian High Commis-
sioner up in business at Washington, and
the more frequent explanation that before
lux ,1":? man’s departure it was decided
that while in London he should “consider the
necessity of a Minister temporarily remain-
ing in London as a member of the War
Cabinet. There are constitutional difficul-
ties with the British Government about the
Washington business. There are none about
the other, though the situation is a little
calamitous for Hughes personally by the
complications Lloyd George happens to be
tangled up in. The main point about what
is going on, however, is that if Hughes pre-
vails upon jiimself to “remain in London”
the time will be quite ripe for him to be
no longer Prime Minister of the Common-
wealth. The importance of “Dominion re-
presentation on the War Council” has been
absurdly exaggerated. In any case the place
of the Prime Minister, whoever he may be,
1S he . re on the premises. It would be a scan-
dal if the Liberals or any other party gave
sanction to an arrangement by which, be-
cause for party reasons an undesirable indi-
vidual had to be provided for, the head of
the Government was inaccessible to Parlia-
ment. The shirk of successive Federal Min-
istries has been bad enough, but under such
arrangements as this it would be worse than
ever.
Justice at Two Bob a Mile.
“Buzfuz” waves his horsetail:—
The N. S. Males Bar Council has always been a
mild and anasmic body, but in spite of itself it has
lately been lashed to protest. The Council believes
that it knows the Government’s intentions with
reference to vacant judgeships, and these alleged
intentions are responsible for the jib. According to
the Council the possible appointees are three, and
the Courts to which they are appointable are also
three. The alleged likely appointees are J. J. Cohen
(Speaker of the Assembly), David Hall (Attorney-
General) and ,T. D. Fitzgerald (Minister in the Leg.
Council). The Courts to which they might be appointed
are respectively the Supreme Court, the District Court
and the Arbitration Court. It is vitally important
to the community that none but highly-trained men
should preside over any of these courts. In the
case of the Supreme Court the necessity speaks for
itself. The tribunal is a costly one for the liti-
gant, and bad law handed from the Bench results
in still more costly appeals. In the case of the
Arbitration Court the necessity for skilled Judges
is equally great, although the reason is not the
same. No appeal is allowed from this court. The
jurisdiction of the District Court in this com-
munity has been made so wide and so varied that
anything but the highest skill obtainable would be
deplorable. The District Court was originally
modelled on the English County Court, and there is
a hazy general notion that the District Court has
stood still, so to speak, ever since. The English
County Court is a rough-and-ready rural jurisdic-
tion, where a Judge who rules over a limited local
area decides cases involving small monetary claims.
It has no criminal jurisdiction whatever. Th<> Dis-
trict Court Judge, on the other hand, decides cases
involving claims up to £400; he has a jurisdiction
in every criminal offence not involving the death
penalty, and he handles all appeals from justices.
It is clear, therefore, that he can fit himself for
the adequate performance of this work only by a
sound and thorough training at the Bar. With the
retirement of Docker and Fitzhabdinge two judge-
ships will presently fall vacant. The Bar Council
apprehends that they will be filled by two out of
the three politicians named. It points out that
the only qualification possessed by any of the three
is a “call” to the Bar, and that such call is no
guarantee of even a reasonable knowledge of law.
The Bar demands that the vacancies must be filled by
men who have acquired a title to Bench places by
practice in the courts, and that they must not be
jobbed into by politicians, as such.
The Council has reason for suspecting the Gov-
ernment of rash and irresponsible intentions in rela-
tion to the District Court Bench. The policy for
some years past has been to run this Bench increas-
ingly on the cheap. More work has been put on the
shoulders of individual Judges than was reasonable.
There used to be eight District Court Judges before
the retirement of Murray and Rogers, but now there
are six— Hamilton, Docker, Bevan, Sciioles, Fitz-
hardinge and Backhouse. Two of the six must
be permanently in Sydney, leaving four for the
country. The country is split for District Court
purposes into what may be called four “circuits,”
and on the number of Judges available each Judge
in the year of 52 weeks has to get through 45 Dis-
trict Courts and, in addition, he has to struggle
with 30 to 38 Courts of Quarter Sessions of criminal
jurisdiction.
No court in N. S. Wales is a fitting haven for
the incompetent. The public has to pay too
heavily for “law” and what it gets should be the
best that can be dispensed.

The Order of the Bun.
“Solomon Malaprot” writes: —
Australia heard of two notable events on one
recent day. The papers mentioned that the first ship
launched for us in California, because we seem to
have lost the shipbuilding art, was also the first
ship which the U.S. has built for any section of the
British Empire. So this country takes the Imperial
bun in at least one line for lack of self-reliance. It
was also mentioned that the Amalgamated Society
of Engineers threatened to visit some kind of punish-
ment on those members who had signed agreements
to perpetrate the crime of shipbuilding for the Aus-
tralian Government. Perhaps this might be called
“victimisation.” Apparently many things may hap-
pen to a unionist in our land of the free. No doubt
there may be reason in the contention that a worker
should consult his union in such a matter. But there
ought to be a time limit for unions. When the
Aulic Councillors at the head of affairs are capable
of thinking for a year or two or more before a com-
paratively simple job can get started, the middle-
aged private in the industrial ranks is liable to
grow impatient. Years are creeping upon him, and
poverty and grey hairs and the old age pension,
and he wearies of the tremendous intellects that can
create a strike in two hours but don’t, seem able
to create a punt for service against the Hun in two
centuries. Possibly Hughes’s great-grandson several
times removed, living under the rule of Pharaoh
Australis 111., may be just in time to witness the
launching of our Dreadnought for service against
the German republic. These are days of change.
Some people run vainly after 'a lost train. Others,
less prompt, are still running to catch Noah’s ark.
The Call to Ireland.
L ,
At last some horse-sense is being applied to
the question of Irish recruiting. Lynch,
who fought on the Boer side in the South
African struggle, has been prominent among
Home Rule members of the House of Com-
mons in urging that the case against Ger-
many was Ireland’s cause. In 1914 he asked
to be allowed to raise troops and was refused
permission. Now he goes with the rank of
Colonel to tackle the job that he might haye
been at three and a half years ago. That
he will get to it in a way that Ireland can
understand is tolerably certain. His idea of
parading a lot of French veterans under
Joffre through Cork and Meath is likely to
prove effective in working up the enthusi-
asm which until now English officialdom has
so steadily kept down. French troops once
before landed in Ireland to help the popular
cause; and on another occasion a great
army of the Republic was prevented from
getting there only by a terrific tempest. The
landing of Frenchmen this time will have
a greater significance. While most other
countries are being exhausted there is in
Ireland a huge reserve of man-power of the
hard fighting sort that if trained and thrown
into the great ' turmoil might have a real
effect in bringing the war to an end. Con-
scription, which is violently objected to by
every class in Ireland, is plainly not the
method by which the weight of that last
reserve can be secured. Lynch and his
big recruiting scheme look every way pro-
mising. Ireland responds to true leadership;
and, on all appearances, the luck is with
the Allies in that the man-power of the
western Celt has through English blunder-
ing been left unexploited to the last.
Moses and the Borrowers.
Everything that he doesn’t want comes to
the borrower who waits. It isn’t very long
since 1907—the kid that was old enough to
have some education and intelligence then
is still an infant in the eye of the law—and
in that year Australia and Tasmania got
along with £3.894,822 of loan money. It
was an absurd business, for with all the
profits of the permanent and reproductive
works coming in, and the land-sale money
and the rents from public lands, the country
should have been able to pay for all its new
public works out of revenue. Still the posi-
tion was good compared with what came
afterwards, and the community went home
almost sober and fairly happy. In 1915 the
same community spent £20.825,839 of loans
—not war loans, but peace matters exclu-
sively—and zig-zagged on its way, saying it
wouldn’t go home till morning and that it
was a jolly good fellow. It thought it was
happy, but it wasn’t sure. This year it fears
that it will have to struggle along with only
about three times the cadged funds that made
it feel good 11 years ago, and it knows that
it is already very miserable. In another
year it may be back by compulsion to the
1907 level, and it expects to feel like cutting
its throat. It is all the difference between
before and after the drunk. A - man may
be sober on Monday, and in a roaring sfate of
intoxication on Tuesday, and on Wednesday
he may be as sober as he was on Monday.
But he doesn’t feel the same; he is fortunate
if he feels the same on Thursday week. It
will take many years of plain living and high
thinking to get back to the old standard of
comparative honesty, and the living will
have to be plainer and the thinking a great
deal higher than ever before if a complete
recovery is expected. It is a sign of the
times that the Sydney Water and Sewerage
Board is discharging 70 men. Some allege
that this is because the service was over-
manned, but it doesn’t seem so probable as
in some cases, for it is a branch in which
the work is always increasing; not a sta-
tionary business. The Board says the
trouble arises through the cutting down of
the loan vote from £456,000 to £400,000,
combined, of course, with increased prices.
It says it must go slow on the supply of
drains and water, and, presumably, go in
for germs and disease. In 1907 the Ma.
State could have added £1,058,533 to its
annual taxation and paid for all its public
works out of revenue, or it could have added
£2,058,553 to its taxation and had £1,000,000
more for public works than it had under the
borrowing system, and still sworn off loans.
And the revenue from works which had no
interest bill to pay should have given it about
£70,000 extra to spend in the first year of
the new regime, and £140,000 in the second
year, and £210,000 in the third, and £700,000
in the tenth, quite apart from compound
interest, which would have made the tenth
year’s figure about £8,200,000. But, thanks
to the loan jag, the Ma State has had to
add about £2,700,000 (not £2,000,000) a
year to its taxation ; and instead of having
£2,820,000 of extra revenue free of interest
charges to spend on works without recourse
to loans, it has no extra revenue to spend
on works, and reckons that unless it can
borrow more than £5,000,000 a year it can’t
pay for necessary drains. The State, like
all its neighbors, was a fairly vigorous young
man in 1907; now it is a shabby-genteel,
prematurely-old man, explaining to every-
body that the downfall isn’t his fault. And
it can’t get the sort of Government that the
case requires unless it disqualifies the exist-
ing politicians and sta-ts afresh. The kind
of Government required is one that will begin
on the basis that the financial doings since
1907, or at least since 1909, have been those
of a gang of childish, self-seeking, short-
sighted, unpatriotic, shamefully-ignorant and
politically-corrupt tricksters who sold the
people’s future to buy the cheap popularity
which kept them in office. And as nobody
cares to say that he was that kind of person,
or to act in a way that implies he was that
kind of person, a new generation is wanted.
Moses realised that, if the legend is true,
when he led the generation of Israelites
which had borrowed from the Egyptians
back into the desert and waited 40 years till
it had died out and. a new one had grown
up.
N. S. Wales Governor Davidson can pro-
bably be relied on not to make a.ny more re-
marks in public about a change from eight
to 10 hours’ work being a not unpleasant
variation of the industrial menu. It was
only by having a letter from him to Chief
Secretary Fuller read in the Leg. Assem-
bly, explaining away his indiscreet observa-
tions on the subject before the Chamber of
Commerce, that a hurried ruling by Speaker
Coiien, throttling discussion of the incident,
was allowed to pass without disagreement.
It was a wrong ruling, and though the Assem-
bly by one vote agreed to accept it, his Ex.
had a mighty narrow escape of hearing him-
self discussed with great freedom. If the
Governor was not aware of it before he now
knows that to earn £5OOO a year and get a free
house, all that his King and country asks of
him is to occasionally make some vacuuous
observations about “the Empire,” open a
poultry show T now and again, take the chair
at perfectly orthodox functions —always
bearing in mind that he must not speak out
of his turn. That’s about all the Australian
States can find for its squad of imported
Cocked Hats to do. If Sir Walter Davidson
feels that he must unburden an intelligent
opinion on current political and industrial
problems he should drop his gilded job and
step down from the throne to the rostrum.
All the same, The Bulletin sympathises
with any Governor who, by attempts to
throw off the muzzle, shows himself
to be a live and healthy-minded man. It
must be a. truly fearful experience for an
individual possessing even the rudiments of
character to be compelled year by year to
repress his individuality, and keep his
opinions about men and affairs locked up in
the ice-cliest. There is something peril-
ously close to refinement of cruelty in this
sort of thing. It is one of the reasons wliv
this paper hopes to see the time when the
community will reject such imprisonment
and insist on the Cocked Hat becoming an
historical reminiscence.

“Delegate” has the floor: —
If the yell at the N. S. Wales cookies’ conference
held last week in Sydney is any guide—it certainly
has not been so in the past—the name of the
Holman' Government at the next election is plain
mud. The Farmers and Settlers’ Association lias
increased considerably in numbers during the last
two or three years, and it allowed no unnecessary
show of politeness to prevent it expressing its whole-
hearted disgust with the National party, some in-
furiated individuals going as far as to assert that
they would sooner have a straightout Labor crowd in
power. When the break occurred in the Labor party
which resulted in the outing of, Holman and others,
and a reshuffle was made which created the National
Win-the-War (government or Hold-the-Job party, the
cookies joined forces with the new faction. The ensu-
ing election put the Nationalists in strong, and since
then, although they secured two portfolios (Ball
and Beeby), the associated cockies reckon that they
have been ignored. The National Ass. recently held
its annual convention and drew up a sort of policy,
mainly consisting of deferred items, in which the
F. and S. Ass. had no say, much to its wrath.
Further grievance is the fact that the National Ass.
is sending organisers into the country districts with-
out consulting the other Ass., and selecting candi-
dates for next election, which is nearly two years
ahead. The anger of the cockies, starting with the
mishandling of the wheat, has been kept smoulder-
ing in sundry ways, was flared into fury by
the recent appointments to the new Board of Trade,
and has been kept merrily blazing by the fixing-
of the price of meat (although essentially a Federal

matter) and the rumor that the Holman Govern-
ment meditated starting State butcher shops. The
Board of Trade is really the cause of much
of the trouble. Beeby, the leader of the cookies’
party in Parliament, in the early stages of the
creation of the Board, asked the rural associations
to nominate a member to represent the primary pro-
ducers (who the Government now say it is not neces-
sary should bo represented). Accordingly, the
graziers, sheepbreeders, stockowners and farmers
and settlers, after, it is alleged, receiving
an undertaking that it was a genuine “go, ’
unanimously nominated T. I. Campbell, gen. sec. of
the F. and S. Ass. But the city business interests
got busy, and when the numbers went up Camp-
bell was posted among the missing. The
soreness that followed was aggravated by the
appointment of Kavanagh as a member of the Board,
on the nomination of the Trades and Labor Council.
Said appointment, seeing the purpose of the Board,
was a perfectly sensible and legitimate one, but
the cocky doesn’t see it that way. He lifted a loud
voice to point out that a year or so ago the Govern-
ment had called upon him to smash a strike for which
leaders like Kavanagh were considered responsible by
Cocky. Beeby had the pleasant job of explaining
matters, and the enthusiasm he aroused could have
been covered with a postage-stamp. A proposal that
the Rural Ass. should go on its own hoofs politically
was grudgingly withdrawn, but later on there was
practically a stampede to carry a proposal that the
Ass. should take steps to run its own candidates
at the next election. It is odds on that William
Holman will now get busy in an attempt to calm
the wrath, or, failing that, to pass a Preferential
Voting Bill to prevent the split vote putting John
Storey and co. on the Treasury benches. P.S.: I
don’t mention where the general public comes in,
because it doesn’t come in at all.
The Battle Flares Up Again.
Whether the Germans had been spending
the last few weeks getting better from the
influenza or mourning for Von Hindenburg
or getting ready to talk peace doesn’t matter.
The thing that counts is that they have
launched the battering-ram again. At the
moment of writing the news was that they
had hurled themselves at. the French-Ameri-
can lines south and west of Rheims and east-
ward as far as Argonne, which is a sort of
back door to the Verdun sector. The infor-
mation is, of course, fragmentary, but the
crux of it so far is that the enemy had
crossed the Marne at several new points,
had been successfully counter-attacked by
Brother Jonathan in the vicinity of
Chateau-Thierry, the apex of the salient,
that Fritz is struggling to widen, and that
Meaux, 15 miles from Paris, was under bom-
bardment. All this is merely an indication
that the German is' pressing on with the
scheme of getting to Paris. If he makes any
substantial advance down the valley of the
Aisne from the Argonne the position of the
French to the immediate eastward will not
be particularly pleasant. It is probable that
an extension of the fighting front will soon
be heard about, and that this wide out-
flanking movement of the enemy will be
accompanied by another thrust northward of
Paris towards Compeigne and the valley of
the Oise. Meanwhile there is a lot for the
enemy to do before he reaches the line he
got to in September, 1914 —and, certainly,
quite as much for the Allies to accomplish
if he is to be stopped in his tracks. How
or where the current battle will end is as
problematical as the result of the next one;
but the German’s readiness to take the
offensive and his weight when he starts give
no sort of corroboration to the yarn about
him being short of men or grub.

The Scully Episode.
When Perceval Brookfield announced in
the N. S. Wales Leg. Assembly the other
night that he held a written statement made
by Harry Scully, setting forth how Scully
had been induced by the police to bear false
witness against the I.W.W. men now in gaol
for fire-raising exploits in Sydney, the main
question was what would be heard next.
What ictts heard and has since transpired
make it mighty desirable that more should
follow. Scully is the ex-Bananaland phar-
macist whose evidence about the preparation
of incendiary material for, and its use by,
some of the accused men went a long way
towards sending them to prison. It appears
that during the court proceedings incidental
to the prosecutions, Scully was granted a
maintenance allowance and ordinary wit-
ness’s expenses by the Crown, amounting
in all to £l7O. Later he was paid £2OO as
his share of the £5OO reward offered for in-
formation leading to the conviction of the
persons guilty of the charges brought against
the prisoners. Dissatisfied with these pay-
ments on the ground that they were inade-
quate, Scully issued a writ against the
Crown claiming £2OOO. The pleadings were
completed in October last, but Scully failed
to set the case going. After an interval of
six months he wrote to the Inspector-General
of Police pointing out that owing to his con-
nection with the trials it had been impossible
for him to secure employment from chemists,
as they “were afraid of violence from the
1.W.W.” if they gave him an engagement.
He therefore asked that he should be made
a grant of money to enable him to leave Aus-
tralia and begin life again in another coun-
try. The result of this appeal ivas that the
Government sanctioned payment of £l5O to
him, and on June 26 he sailed for San Fran-
cisco en route to London, with a draft for the
aforementioned sum, less the passage-money.
It is between the time of asking the Inspec-
tor-General for cash to get away with and
sailing for ’Frisco that Scully is alleged to
have made confession to Brookfield and
others, who had been pressing to have the
case of the I.W.W. men reopened by the
Crown, of his participation in a conspiracy
with the police to “frame up” the criminal
charge. The result is a more or less direct
allegation that Scully was spirited away by
the Hops, and a claim that the circumstance
calls for an immediate review of the cases
against the men in gaol by a Royal Commis-
sion. The claim is one that the Ministry
will find hard to resist and unwise not to
listen to. The Bulletin does not know
exactly what Scully’s written statement
contains. It does not know whether [Scully
actually signed anything or whether the un-
produced written statement may not have
been written by somebody else after a con-
versation with the man. Nor does this paper
understand why, if Brookfield and others
held a written confession from him or had
received a verbal confession, they, allowed
even 24 hours to pass without getting very
busy. But that Scully did either say.or
write something uncomfortably compromising
seems beyond doubt. The trouble the Crown
is in looks to be about the same as con-
fronts Brookfield and co. —that from
whatever angle Scully is contemplated he
wears the apnearance of being untrustworthy.
On the available evidence it is just as
reasonable to suppose that Scully lied to
Brookfield as that he perjured himself
before a jury—or that the position is the
other way round. What justification is
there for supposing that Scully told the
truth to Brookfield? How much room is
there for believing that if he did not shrink
from accusing himself of the basest iniquity
he shrank from falsehood in the witness-box?
The Bulletin cannot answer these ques-
tions ; but they ought to be answered, and
until they are a heavy cloud of doubt will
rest over evidence which in a great measure
clinched the conviction of a dozen men.
Scully may not be the rascal that he is
alleged to have accused himself of being. It
is conceivable that he imagined himself to
be under some sort of duress —that in hand-
ing ammunition to Brookfield he may have
been exercising an inverted sense of humor
and working off a grudge against the police
for not handing him a bigger wad of money.
The sooner Mr. Scully can be interviewed
again, and more light shed on the prevailing
gloom, the better for all concerned in the
business.
In the Coal Bin.
“G. Arden Hill” : The efforts of Beeby,
Minister for Toil, to persuade the coal-
miners of N. S. Wales to accept the new Arbi-
tration Act have so far been unsuccessful.
The Minister declares that the bulk of the
men are sympathetic, and he is hopeful, but
the attitude of the Miners’ Federation indi-
cates either studied indifference or camou-
flaged hostility. It is reported that the
Southern and Western branches have
accepted the proposals, but their acquies-
cence has not been followed up by any offi-
cial move in the direction of appointing
representatives to the conciliation commit-
tees, and there is a suspicion of insincerity
about the matter. The Northern branch
has definitely rejected the proposals because
the victimisation question has not been satis-
factorily adjusted, and this view seems to
coincide with the mind of the central council
of the Federation. In order to combat this
opposition the Minister for Hard Graft now
proposes to hold a ballot among the men to
elect conciliation representatives. It . is
difficult to see how this is going to be carried
out. It would be foolish to thrust “repre-
sentatives” on the men on a straggling,
minority vote which would no doubt result
if the Federation was ignored, for a com-
mittee so constituted would be unworkable.
Probably not more than 20 per cent, of the
miners know what the proposals are, and the
other »0 per cent, don’t want to know. The
men were so badly biffed in the recent strike
that there has followed a spirit of Don’t
Care. The miners now make the best terms
possible with the boss: but when anything
big crops up in the way of disputes it is
customary to seek the services of Judge
Edmunds as arbiter. This preference is
due to the fact that his Honor has more
than once donned the overalls and gone below
to study the conditions for himself. What
alternative the miners’ officials propose to
accepting the new Act, or whether there is
an alternative, is not clear. In the mean-
time some of the full-time pits still take a
day off to consider whether a wheeler should
have been dismissed for telling' the boss to
go to Blazes, but in the majority of mines
work has been so scant lately, owing to tne
dearth of bottoms, that the men are glad to
get a day when the whistle blows, without
bothering their heads about the irritations
inseparable from the industry.

Jumbucks and Printing’ Paper.
P. C. Thompson, Tabulam (N.S.W.), puts
it this way :
The rise in the price of The Bulletin synchronises
with the official drop in the price of beef. Therefore
The Bulletin gets an increased income of 33 per .
cent, and its beef at a reduction of 15 or 20 per
cent. But if we advertise that owing to an increase
in the price of store-stock we are compelled to
advance the quotations for beef, the newspapers smite
us in the neck.
All of which would have a bearing, on fhe
great chop-and-steak controversy if The
Bulletin sold itself at cheap rates for con-
sumption outside the Commonwealth and at
double the price to F. C. Thompson. But
it doesn’t. F. C. Thompson pays no more
than the individual who buys for shipment
to Chicago, Kobe, London or the trenches.
Moreover, The Bulletin does not consume
beef —it consumes paper which has to be
imported through minefields and dodge past
submarines, and be paid for through the nose.
Thompson’s bullocks and jumbucks browse
in perfect safety, they eat no more grass
than their predecessors digested, and have
been going up in price ever since the war
began. In any case it is 'an absurdity to
say that meat goes up in price because store
animals become dearer. The price of beef
and hides and of mutton and wool, in con-
junction with the water and grass supplies,
determine the price of stores. When wool
declines in value the quotations for the ewe
and the wether subside. And so with
mutton, though F. C. Thompson seems to
have the delusion that the proceedings are
the other way round.
“F.G.L.’s” word in Australia’s ear: —
It’s up to the Commonwealth to adopt the auto-
matic rifle for its citizen forces, for there is no
doubt that this is the arm of the future. It has
been tried out in .this war by the Huns, whose
picked storm troops are reported to be carrying- it
instead of the regulation Mauser. - In Gippsland a
couple of months back I made trials with a 22-cal.
automatic rifle. The clip carried 10 cartridges, was
put in with one movement and the 10 shots could
be got off in about 3 or 4 seconds by simply pressing
the trigger. No pulling back of bolt to eject the
old cartridge, and none of the jambing that takes
place frequently if the bolt is not jerked smartly
enough. When one clip is fired you can knock a
fresh one into place in a fraction of the time taken
with the old magazines. With a clip taking 10
cartridges and carrying, say, two belts with 20 clips
on each belt a man armed with an automatic rifle
has what is practically a machfne-gun weighing no
more than 91b. As most killing by rifle-fire in War
nowadays is done at pretty close range, it takes no
great imagination to see that Minister for Defence
Pearce should get busy as suddenly as possible and
have the automatic issued to the citizen troops
in place of the now- obsolete magazine rifle.
But I suppose we will have to wait until the notor-
iously slow British War Office jerries to the necessity
for a change. Then a decade or so after that the
Australian Defence Department will probably hear
that there is such a weapon as an automatic rifle
and will proceed with great gradualnes3 to get
one or two made, or, rather, imported.
+
lleported dead at 69, Von Hindenburg,
German commander-in-chief. Three men
have held down the job since Europe went
mad— Von Moltke, who was scrapped after
the Marne, and subsequently died of shame
or something; Von Falkynhyde, who
risked everything on Verdun, and was passed
down a step or two; and the grim old Prus-
sian who inflicted a fearful defeat on the
Russians at Thannenburg. When the dis-
turbance started Hindenburg was on the
retired list. But in his active days he had
learned to know the terrain of Eastern
Prussia and the bogs and pathways round
the Mazurian lakes better than anyone of
his rank then living. Wherefore he was
promptly sent for to pitch the advancing
Russians out, and, with Ludendorff as his
chief of staff he did the job with tremendous
emphasis and despatch. This lifted them
both to the top. They were hailed as the “dis-
coveries of the war” and became the popular
heroes of the Fatherland. Hindenburg
appears to have been a typical Prussian—an
iron-fisted militarist whose sole god was
Force.
Apropos a recent paragraph in reference
to Joseph Rutherford, lately sentenced to
20 years’ gaol for conspiring to violate the
United States espionage law, and the gratui-
tous distribution in Australia of a publica-
tion issued by the International Bible
Students’ Association, in which Rutherford
has some interest. The Bulletin has re-
ceived numerous letters. One from E. Iv.
Bignall, who writes in defence of the
“prophet with a bag of literature" referred to
by this paper, denies that this citizen is a
“disguised Ilun pacifist." The Bulletin
did not say he was, or think that he was.
It merely remarked that some of the litera-
ture he handed round suggested an instal-
ment of Hun-made pacifism, and that this
being so, someone ought to find out more
about it. According to Bignall the hopes of
J. Rutherford and the local prophet are
heavenly. No doubt. But the important
fact is that J. Rutherford is hold for some-
thing in the way of treason. The Bulle-
tin thought that this was a fairly good
reason for keeping an eye on the' literature,
and, in spite of a cordial invitation to send
the staff round to a meeting of biblical stu-
dents, it thinks so still.
“The Oldest Inhabitant's” turn-out:—
The T2th of July celebrations in Sydney recalls a
projected 12th of July procession in Melbourne in 1844.
The “paddies” had held a procession on March 17,
and the L.0.L., then just established, decided to have
one on the Orange Pup’s day (which is the anniver-
sary of the Battle of Aughrim, 1691; not of the
Boyne, which was fought on July 1, 1690). The
L.O.L.’s were led in those days by a pressman named
Kerr, who afterwards became Town Clerk of Mol
bourne and later, in his declining years, station
master at Sunbury, a position given him by John
O’Shanassy, whom he had often “anathcma'd.” The
Pats decided that there should be no Orange display,
but they did not openly say so; but it was hinted
that the procession would be met and bloodshed might
follow. Things were in a state of uncertainty until
the morning of the 9th, when an advertisement
appeared in the Herald inviting all colonists hailing
from the South of Ireland to assemble in force at
Batman’s Hill (Spencer-street Railway' Station occu- ,
pies the site) at 10 o’clock a.m. on the T2th to
witness a hurling match between Clare and Tipperary
for £5O. This call was freely responded to, and at
the hour indicated “groups of well-dressed, well-
developed Hibernians began to gather at the ren-
dezvous, and the collection of sticks, staves, hurlies
and every other kind of conceivable wooden weapon
would lead an impartial observer to fancy that a
slice of the far-famed wood of Shillelagh had been
surreptitiously imported into the young colony,” as a
newspaper reporter described it. The procession did
not come off, but the hurling match did, the “Tips’
being led by big John O’Shanassy, who five year-
before had emigrated from Thurles. After the hurling
the first football in Port Phillip was played, at the
foot of Batman’s Hill.
“F. .Bom" : The so-called contingent vote,
which allows for a secondary vote in addition
to the first one, has failed in Bananaland
because it is not compulsory. The majority
of the electors avoid it; but the present,
limited, inefficient system has its uses. At
the last State election three candidates stood
for Pittswortli, a strong Liberal constituency.
As a result of the spilt vote on the National
side a Labor man headed the poll on the
primary count. The secondary count how-
ever gave the seat to a Liberal, a decision in
keeping with the majority opinion of the elec-
torate. W. O. Hodgkinson fathered the con-
tingent vote in the Assembly. In the next
election he headed the poll on the primary
count, but the contingent vote biffed him out.
It is the mission of Reform to devour its
parents.
Tom Mann is expected in Melbourne
almost immediately with the object of mak-
ing a brief tour of Australia. Since Tom
was in Melbourne last the Socialist Club,
which he established in a Gollins-street
cellar, has done well. From the dug-out the
fraternity found it necessary to move to
Hockin’s Assembly Hall, Elizabeth-street.
where the cause was maintained for a num-
ber of years. Thence to the big hall of the
Democratic Club, Exhibition-street. The
funds are prosperous. So popular have been
the Sunday-night lectures, by Scott Ben-
nett and others, that the Bourke-street Em-
pire Theatre is engaged frequently in addi-
tion to the party’s own hall. The energetic
Brother Mann expects to impress himself
upon Australia for eight weeks.
“Podolia” : The earth closed over an adven-
turer when, on July 12, Ladiolas S. Ivossak.
captain of Polish Lancers, fellow-refugee
with Louis Kossuth and officer of police at
Eureka, was laid to rest in Springvale„
(Vic.) Cemetery, at the age of 90. A scion
of an old Polish family, he left Lemberg
University in 1547 to aid Kossuth in the
Hungarian revolution which was crushed by
Russia. He and his leader took refuge in
Constantinople, and went thence on a Turk-
ish warship to England. Kossak had hardly
been naturalised when the golden magnet
drew him to Australia, where he joined
Sturt’s Cadets. He commanded a body or
troopers in the Eureka attack, and rose to
the rank of inspector. Called home to
Poland by the rebellion of 3863. he returned
broken in spirit to England when Freedom
shrieked in 1864. In 1875 he came back
to Australia with his wife and young family,
and began all over again. He was in West-
ralia in the boom days, but ended a rest-
less life in Victoria, the dream of his youth
unfulfilled.

If “Bits and Pieces” would only throw its
plot and most of its dialogue under
the stage of the Tivoli (Sydney) and
resolve to be cheerfully disjointed it
'would be a better show. Even then
it would be short of a good comedian.
Prank Greene and C. B- Workman do their
best with the dialogue; but it’s poor stuff,
and even with the assistance of the stage
police they couldn’t arrest attention. Here
and there a good turn cheers. The dancing
Magleys provide the big hit of the show,
and Rene Adoree Magley, the dainty little
(Parisian partner, quaintly dressed in white,
sings a simple French song with the four
Tivoli Kiddies assisting as miniature French
johnnies. It’s a trifling little item and few
know what it’s all about; but the delicate
art of the singer brings it through. Elsie
Parkes, Jean Keith and Mabel Holmes lead
in two ballets which arc diverting; but
neither of them is as striking as the black-
and-white “Garden of Eden,” in which Jean
Keith scored in “Samples,” or the “Ballets
A and B” of Elsie Parkes in the same pro-
duction. Neiman and Kennedy, the droll,
black-faced team, work off some good patter
when the drop and the plot are behind them,
and Kennedy throws in a gliding eccentric
dance that has humor. Otherwise they are
two good vaudevillains mislaid. Ethel
Vaugn hunches her shoulders and plods
about, but the plot has her beaten too. Her
best number is a bogie-man song, during
which the chorus-girls become one huge green
dragon supported by numerous pairs of
shapely legs. (The dragon’s shoe-bill must
be formidable.) Celia Ghiloni, Nellie Leach,
Peggy Peate and Eileen Boyd have few song
hits. “A Bit of the Underworld,” with a Harry
Whaite setting, shows the sort of opium-
stricken Chinatown the modern, respectable
sightseer gets corns seeking for in vain.
(The Melbourne wowsers who have just
fitted “Time, Please!” with extra trousers
free will be waiting for the harmless thing
with an axe when “Bits and Pieces” reaches
Bourke-street). The color scheme —blue
with deep-red lamps—is artful, and the
pantomime of the murderous Chows and their
European victims holds the interest to the
end. Another Whaite set based on a willow
pattern nlate is charming with its soft blues
and brilliant whites under strong lights.
“BITS AND PIECES,” AT SYDNEY
TIVOLI.
Neiman and Kennedy, coon impersonators,
devouring a pie in bits and pieces.
John Chilcote, M.P., is still fishing his
secret stocks of morphia out of the vases
and picking them off the chandelier at the
Palace (Sydney), and there’s always, a full
house to see him do it. One of the things
that keeps “The Masquerader” well adver-
tised is the quick change in the garden-party
scene, and arguments about it pop and fizz
at every suburban gathering. How does
Guy B. Post manage it? Obviously the
only way to settle the argument is to go
again.
“Oh. Boy!” is out for a non-stop run at
Her Majesty’s (Sydney). The big, glit-
tering show has a full cargo of catchy music,
the Lady Duff Gordon charming gowns and
more quotable lines generally than most
frolics of its kind.
“The Thirteenth Chair” continues to fur-
nish the Cri. (Sydney), and the Spring
cleaning is afar.
An orchestral concert in Sydney Conserva-
torium, with a popular list of items and
Verbrugghen in thq conductor’s pen, gives
the ordinary music-loving citizen the pleas-
ant feeling of having treated himself-herself
well. The other night the orchestra gave the
necessary relish in a Boccherini “Minuet”—-a
delicate thing. Tschaikowsky’s Casse-Noisette
was another morsel which needed no col-
lege of music to explain its charm. The
“Freisehutz” overture proved the orchestra’s
perfection. Verbrugghen has rarely pre-
sented a more charming programme, and a
big audience gratefully applauded (some-
times in forbidden places) the evening’s fine
display of local talent under the distin-
guished baton that stirred stringed instru-
ments into virile life, and made the roll of
drums a welcome episode.
The Frivolities continue to hold up their
end of Castlereagh-street at the Playhouse.
Some of the big shows down-town have
“star” singers who bluff through with the
help of the orchestra; the Frivs,’ voices are
genuine and their entertainment ranges
creditably from grand opera to revue.

How Viola Dana, as Judith, creates her
world from such stuff as dreams are made
of, and wakes to find that her Prince Charm-
ing has been giving the invitation glance to
“another,” is told at the Globe (Sydney) in
the screen version of Myrtle Reed’s novel,
“The Weaver of Dreams.” The film deals
partly with the syphilis evil and its eradi-
cation. The Crystal Palace has this inten-
sity also. The Lyceum is showing “Be-
trayed”—plenty of good fun and a surprise
ending. The Strand holds the mystery and
romance of the “East” as woven by Rudyard
Kipling and Balestier in “The Naulahka.”
And, if you are not quite frozen these
nights, drop into the Grand, where the
Stefansson Arctic party disport themselves
amid frozen seas and upon glacier cliffs.
A pleasant sight at the Majestic (Adel-
aide) is Bessie Lester, giving with great soul-
fulness a serious American ballad which
sounds more like a burlesque, telling how
baby “goes upstairs, all unawares, and says
her prayers”; also (as this writer caught
it) “baby’s ears are full of tears.” Philip
Newbury is still in magnificent voice; and in
the second part Les War ton, exchanging
back-talk with Harry Burgess (a very funny
stage-nigger) recalls the old days of Irving
Sayles. At the Tivoli is one of those “moral
p'ays” which teach a lesson of virtue*by long
illustration of sin. In “Fallen Among
Thieves” Marie Dalton, Ida Gresham, Stan-
ford and Dora Mostyn show up well. The
Scarlet Gaieties at the King’s go on
rather broader lines than most of such
teams. Their operatic selections are
good, but they can put up also a
good revue or comic sketch. At the Royal,
Ivathlene MacdonelTs speedy return is
announced; meanwhile there are good pic-
tures, particularly of a burning theatre.
Others are “The Land of Promise,” with
Billie Burke, at Wondergraph ; and “Mighty
Fighters” at West’s. The marked success of
the moment is a filmed version of “The Monk
and the Woman,” with Marmont and Maud
Fane in the leads.
The Town Hall has
been taken for this
picture, and busi-
ness is prosperous.
At the King’s
(Melb.) the long-
lost memory of “De
Luxe Annie” con-
tinues to return to
her seven times a
week, and the play
begins and ends as
before with conver-
sation in a Pull-
man car. In re-
gard to its first and
last scenes, which
are unessential to
the rest of the per-
forma n c e, “De
Luxe Annie” re-
minds one of
“Fanny’s First
1‘ 1 a y.” Between
Annie and Fanny,
however, there is
as much difference
as between maiden
innoc e n c e and
matronly virtue.

plays the name-part.” Driven snow is not
more spotless, nor is ice more cold and pure.
She forgets everything save Jimmy’s ungodly
business and the respect due to a lady. The
character Miss Polini plays is truly an inter-
esting study in psychology, also it is 'a start-
ling reminder that a wife who goes away and
forgets hubby is' a mere wandering lamb,
whereas a hubby who forgets his Annie in a
like manner is liable to be pinched for main-
tenance and gaoled if he disobeys the order of
the Court. The writer once knew a forgetful
man who went into partnership with a
strange goddess, and the Law’s method of
restoring him to reason was anything but
surgical. The inequality of the sexes was
emphasised by the action of the missus he
had overlooked.

“The Man Who Came Back” is also still
returning to respectability at the Royal
(Melb.). Marriages made in opium-dens
don’t usually lead to reformation in real life,
but Marcelle and Harry are two exceptional
birds of a feather who, fly together to a higher
way of thinking. For one thing, they start
housekeeping on a pineapple plantation.
Probably the juice of the pineapple enters
into their simple life and makes it sweet.
Anyhow, Marcelle’s doubt concerning Harry’s
conversion is dispelled by his burst of indig-
nation, _ when she pretends to be horribly
drunk in the presence of himself and his
immaculate aunt from New York (Marion
Marcus Clarke). She cries “Saved!” and
packs him off home for six months to make
good with his father. The play is not very
stirring after the young man has made good,
but as long as he remains unregenerate it is
full of ginger. Practice has given smoothness
to the Cabaret scene. The incidental dancers
no longer look as though they had been
pushed into the entertainment to make it go.
Ihey seem more like casual passers-by on
Kimball’s road to ruin, and their fox-trotting
wafts a sultry air of dissipation across the
footlights, as it were.

a good deal in a show which forgets to be

poetry and scenic effect. Even the fact that

part of the bill, and he has become such an

given charge of the Ma State ledger. A new
“Trio Classique,” ’cello, flute and piano,
afford a rare musical interlude and achieve
a success that is almost soulful. The Stan-

William Hart is plugging the usual holes
in adjacent humanity as the hero of “The
Silent Man”, at Hoyt’s (Melb.), this week.
William bristles with artillery, and it is
plain that he is a contributing factor in the
high price of lead. The change from Bill to
Marguerite Clark in “Babs’ Matinee Idol”
is like leaving the slaughter-house for the
nursery, but Marguerite’s work in the trifle
is surprising and her smile has the genuine
sparkle of innocence. Next Saturday Hoyt's
will move from the Olympia (near Princes
Bridge) to the neighboring West’s Palace,
which the electrics will henceforth announce
as the Lyceum. The first offering at the new
stand will be the Fox version of Hugo’s
“Les Miserables,” with William Farnum in
the part of Jean Valjean.
“Tarzan of the Apes” had three days at
the Britannia (Melb.) this week and made
a visit to the zoo unnecessary. Tarzan has
a great tribe of animal pals, and in one
scene charges a village with his elephant
cavalry to avenge the massacre of his ape
mamma. The appearance of Constance Tal-
madge in “The Honeymoon” gave a
dash of civilisation to the programme, but
the supporters of the Britannia will need
somebody more vivid than Connie to disturb
their memory of Mr. Tarzan. At the Melba
William Farnum is leading in “A Soldier’s
Oath.” The film comes from the Fox studio
and arouses the same sort of feeling as the
discovery of a rattlesnake under the bed.
A second series of Chappell Ballad Con-
certs was started at the Auditorium (Melb.)
on Saturday, when the principal warbler was
Cacialli, the mellifluous basso and hardest-
worked member of the late Gonsalez Opera
Co. Elsie Steele violined, and Kirby (not
Walter of that name) played the piano. Also
the Orpheon Choristers let themselves go in
the Soldiers’ Chorus from “Faust” and in
Sullivan’s “The* Night is Calm,” the soprano
solo being one of Florence Fawaz’s contribu-
tions to a feast of melody.
Louis Esson sees a show in London:—
Whr pictures are suspended in the air, but some
of them would be better under the earth. We have
them by Australians, Britishers, Serbians, Belgians,
artists, Cubists and photographers. The curse of
British art is its “respectability,” so even war has
to be made respectable. Before some inanity at
the Royal Academy, supposed to bo a battle scene,
a lady Will remark, “Isn’t it sweet!” Quinn has a
racy portrait of Birdwood, a fine bit of work. But
on the whole one agrees with the old lady who said
“I’ve got such a headache, but I had to go, it’s so
educational.” The Australian war pictures at the
Grafton Galleries, by Bryant, Crozier, Leist, Power
and Quinn have to be looked upon only as sketches
to be worked up later. Crozier is the youngest
and least developed painter of the team, but despite
a certain awkwardness of handling he sometimes con-
veys a big conception of battle. Lambert has a little
sketch of “The Wassail,” the famous Cairo street,
of which merry tales are told. But the war pictures
of William Orpen, the Irish painter, stand alone.
At Agnew’s he has an exhibition of 125 works —an
astounding collection. A virtuoso, he belongs to no
school, but is realistic, romantic, impressionist, deco-
rative, humorous by turns. He passes easily from
poetic landscape to grim satire. There is no end to
h’s invention. As Arnold Bennett says, in an intro-
ductory note: “War is monotonous. This is the
opinion of all soldiers, and it is the opinion of artists
who have seen the war. But William Orpen comes
along and brilliantly disproves what everybody else
knows in his heart to be a profound truth. War
is monotonous—for all men except William Orpen.”
From his brush are portraits of Haig, French and a
great one of airman Trenchard; landscapes; comedy
and tragedy; an orgy of line and brilliant color.
There is no deception, no false sentiment; the
painter accepts things as they are, good or evil, and
succeeds in giving a vision of reality. It is, perhaps,
not quite pure art, like that, say, of Whistler, but
it is extraordinarily expressive and intensely alive.
And he has a wicked sense of humor that is quite
un-English. Adelaide has the only Orpen canvas in
Australia, and it is put away in the cellar for fear
of shocking the morals of the Presbyterian synod.
“N. or M.”: Good luck to the fighting Bar-
wicks of Tasmania. The first Barwiek, in
the Tasmanian count, had 10 sons, who all
married and raised families averaging 10.
The clan has sent over 100 fighting men to
the trenches. Will Banvick has been in
the thick of things from the beginning and
was the second man to enlist in Tas.
In four years’ fighting he has acquired
several wounds, a Military Medal and a Bel-
gian Cross. The others have a good sprink-
ling of decorations. So far Tassy’s record
military family has been the Terrys, whose
steadily increasing fighting force went into
three figures a year ago.

That shows the bite taxation has been tak-
ing out of profits recently; in 1912 taxes
absorbed about 1] p.c. of gross profits; for
the past two years tin average of over 121
p.c. has been paid out. Most of this increase
has been due to British war taxes. However,
the- London’s figures have been steadily
climbing: and actual results are probably
even better than disclosed by the published
accounts, dross profits are shown after pro-
viding for bad and doubtful debts, and most
likely the directors are putting more than
usual aside to meet any possible trouble that
may follow upon present abnormal condi-
tions. That the directors have been cautious
in this respect in the past is shown by the
£135,000 of internal reserves which they
were able to bring to light four years ago,
and also by the leap in profits within a few
years when they apparently became satisfied
that the effects of the 1903-4 drought had
passed away and that there was no need to
provide further for any contingencies that
might have followed that, dull period.
The London has made good progress dur-
ing the past 10 years. That the public has
confidence in the management is shown by
the new money which has been given into
its care. Since 1907 new deposits have
increased by almost 83 p.c. This shows how
the balance-sheet figures have moved: —

The “Old deposits, £939,220” in the 1907
column is a relic of the smash of the ’nine-
ties. It’s all back history now, for the clean-
up was completed five years ago when the
final payment to the old depositors was
made. The London undertook to repay every
penny of the money it held in trust when the
smash came. Depositors were given the
option of taking up 5$ p.c. cumulative pref.
shares or accepting 4| p.c. transferable de-
posit receipts. Most of the old customers,
however, preferred the receipts, and only
£171,930 of prefs. were issued, while over 4f
millions of old deposits remained. The posi-
tion as regards these prefs. was that after
they had received 7 p.c. for five years they
would no longer be preferential as to dividend
but merely have first call for principal. So
if profits should shrink they no longer take
precedence in getting their bite of whatever
may be available for distribution to share-
holders.
Since the war started the London has
strengthened its holding of liquid assets;
in 1913 it had £6,470.519 of the public’s
money and held 42 p.c. of it liquid ; now its
liabilities are £7,232,719, of which 45 p.c.
is in liquid assets. To meet the remaining
£3,969,723 of liabilities not covered by liquid
assets there is £5,072,135 in advances and
premises. So from the depositors’ point of
view the position is quite comfortable. The
total liabilities to the public are under 6|
times the amount of the bank’s own funds.
In Australia liabilities of 8 times, and in
England 12 times, a hank’s combined capital
and reserves are reckoned to be reasonable
limits. As to the future, everything depends
on how the Commonwealth comes out of the
war and how the politicians manage its
affairs. The outlook in the latter respect
is certainly not cheerful. However, if every-
thing does turn out all right, the London
Bank of Australia will be in a good position
to extend its business.

The profit for the past year is somewhat
surprising: it is .more than the combined
profits of the previous two years, and has
been exceeded only once in the co.’s history.
In 191(5 and 1917 earnings were seriously
affected by increased cost of raw materials
and heavier production charges. It is unlikely
that conditions have improved much during
the past 12 months; but apparently the co.
has been able to pass on the extra costs to
the consumer. The adjustment of the prices
of its products to meet the varying costs of
raw materials is always a difficult pro-
blem with a co. like this, and that mainly
explains why profits have been so erratic.
In years of plenty the co. has been able to
buy cheaply, and at the same time find a
ready market for its goods. In drought
times higher prices have to be paid
for the raw materials required, and
while the co. is being hit from this
direction it cannot afford to tinker too
much with its shop prices. There is nothing
so liable to disturb the popularity of an article
than that the purchaser should find its price
varying from week to week. However, the
co.’s business has been growing steadily, and
during the past five years £04,021 of new
capital has been got in—-all 0 p.c. cumulative
prefs., ranking equally with the ords. when
the latter exceed a 0 p.c. distribution.
This table shows how the balance-sheet
figures have moved in 10 years:—

The one item that mars the balance-sheet is
this unusual entry: “Original purchase at
cost from the firm of Swallow and Ariell of
freehold lands, buildings, machinery, plant,
etc., including goodwill, £148,500.” That
mixture and its book value have remained
unaltered for 30 years now. To say the least
of it, it is unsatisfactory, because (1) plant
and machinery acquired second-hand 30 years
ago have probably been scrapped long ago;
(2) the goodwill of the old co. is not worth
anything now. Whatever goodwill may be
worth at present is entirely due' to the 30
years’ attainments of the present co., so the
old goodwill item should have been dumped
long ago. How much' of the £145,500 was
paid for it The Bulletin does not
know, and that is why the reserves of
£129,390 in the first table are treated as
nominal. Another curious feature about
Swallow and Ariell’s is that the whole allow-
ance for depreciation is deducted from the
new properties, plant, etc., purchased by the
present co.- —the £96,435 credited to “other
properties” in the 1918 figures. To this
item there is tacked each year “Additional
depreciation.” What allowance has been
made out of each year’s profits for this “total
depreciation,” and whether the provision has
been sufficient or more than adequate, there
are no means of telling.
Taking it for granted that sufficient has
been allowed to cover depreciation, then a
comparison of the present figures with those
of 10 years ago, shows good progress. Capi-
tal has been increased by £75,646 and liabili-
ties by £36.479. Meantime, £139.846 has
been added to liquid assets and £60,875 to
properties, plant, etc. So.in the 10 years in
addition to paying a dividend averaging a
little over 6* p.c. p.a. the co. has put almost
£88,600 of profit into the business —or more
than half the paid-up capital in 1908.

“As stated in previous reports,” the direc-
tors say, “it was necessary only that the
financial position of the co. should he suffici-
ently strong to pay out some of the profits
made in past years.” So in addition to a
10 p.c. dividend a bonus of 5 p.c. for the
half-year is handed out, thus helping to fill
in the blanks that occur between 1013 and
1915 in the table above. The trouble was
that, as the building boom expanded, McKen-
zie’s made the pace in stacking up stocks.

The co. naturally could not finance stocks
of £208,124 on a paid-up capital of £130,000,
and it had to lean on the bank. This shows
how liabilities soared in the first three-year
period and the progress that has since been
made in extinguishing the overdraft: —

Mar., 1915., 103,787 Mar., 1918. . 9,543
The £112,820 which the co. has in stocks
in hand and in transit still looks consider-
able, but seeing that sales for the past half-
year totalled £.105,512, the item is really not
excessive.
The chief concern of the future is whether
present prices can be maintained. Not
only has the shortage of shipping seriously
curtailed the export of timbers, but the
local construction boom has come to an end.
Some very interesting evidence concerning
the building trade has been produced this
week. During the year to June 30 only 07
buildings costing £382,435 were erected in
the city of Sydney, and the number of new
buildings erected each year in the metropoli-
tan area since 1913 has decreased rapidly:
June, Buildings. Cost.

1917.. 5916 4,014,527
1918.. 5042 3,485,060
Nor is there much likelihood of an improve-
ment for some considerable time. A brick-
manufacturer told the Commonwealth Prices
Commissioner the other day that he did not
think the brick-making industry would
become normal after the war, and that “the
brick trade would never be running full time
again.”
As mentioned above, McKenzie’s has now
reduced its liabilities to £9543, and capital
is £130,000. In addition to the stocks of
£112,826. there is £69,852 in buildings and
plant. £63,004 in cash and book debts, and
£10,250 in shares in other cos. It will be
noticed in the first table that reserves are
labelled “nominal.” The reason is that
the depreciation reserve (now £57,717) is
included. Repairs and renewals are shown
as charges on profit and loss account, so the
item “Buildings, office furniture, plant and
machinery, £69,852” hardly calls for a de-
preciation reserve of £57,717. Including
this depreciation reserve there are assets
totalling £246,389 to represent capital after
meeting all other liabilities. Or if the
depreciation reserve is not included there are
assets of £188,672 in excess of liabilities, or
about £1 9s. per share.

The prospectus stated that net profits of the
old co. for the four years to 1914 had aver-
aged £6741 per annum. The table above
shows how abnormal trading conditions and
other troubles have affected the figures. Ever
since it started the co. has had a tough fight
to hold its ground. The first year’s trading was
fairly successful; but when prices began to
soar the management found the capital quite
inadequate to maintain the necessary stock,
and the second year’s results were poor.
However, the position has been slightly
eased by the issue of £<l6Bo 7 p.c. prefs.
But still more capital is required, and the
directors are offering a further 30,000 7 p.c.
prefs. which will rank for further dividend
equally with the ordinaries after the latter
exceed 7 p.c. Book debts are heavy and
represent more than half the paid capital
of £40,080. To finance the business the eo.
is at present depending on debentures
(£21,520). Other liabilities total £2403.
Assets are: stock. £30,578; book debts.
£25.104; freeholds, etc., £8095; plant, etc..
£3045 ; and cash, £2O. There are no good-
will items. Further, the old business was pui
chased on a valuation made nine months prior
to settlement, and the co. thus benefited to the
extent of £4OOO, which the directors used to
pay flotation exes, and write down assets.
Of these assets managing-director Jacob
gives the assurance that they are “worth at
least every penny shown on the balance-
sheet.” Nevertheless it will be necessary to
keep a sharp eye on the two largest items—
stocks and book debts.

keting the farmer’s products. It charges com-
mission on everything handled, and at. the
end of each year sets aside portion of the
profits for consignors as a rebate on these
commission charges, pays co-operators a
dividend on their capital and puts tin 1
balance into the business —the producers’ own
business. Nine years ago commission charges
were reduced by 4 p.c., and last year they
were lowered still another 4 p.c., which mostly
explains the decrease in profits for the past
year. Turnover has varied with the erratic
seasons; but for the past two years sales
have been well over the million mark. Capi-
tal is £22.045. The co. has an overdraft
of £30,887, and it owes sundry creditors
£1.1,614, practically all to consignors for
current supplies. On the other side there is
£24,883 of stock on hand, £36,964 of book
debts and £757 in cash, etc. There are thus
more or less liquid assets totalling £62,604
to meet £42,591 of liabilities. Freeholds,
buildings and plant stand in the books at
£15.508 and are apparently well written
down.

Erie Huntley, g.m. of Hampden-Cloncurry,
recently caused a stir amongst the co.’s
employees with this circular, which he handed
round :—•
All employees are notified that during the last
year or so there has, on the average, been a gireat
falling off in the amount of work done on our mines,
and that costs are continually increasing. I fully
recognise that a large proportion of our employees do
a fair day’s work, but, on, the other hand, a large
proportion do not do their best.
This continual increase in cost cannot go on, as a
ton of copper will only pay a certain amount of wages
and stores, and as soon as it costs more than the
copper is worth, the industry must stop.
In order to avoid this calamity I am asking every
man to give the co. a fair deal.
Wages are very high and conditions are as good for
workers as in any part of the world, and in return
for this we ask for a reasonable day’s work.
In order to secure this I have instructed all fore-
men and shift-bosses to discharge any man who sys-
tematically wastes time or loafs.
I do not expect foremen or shift-bosses to drive
men, but I have instructed them to see that every
man does a fair day’s work, as it is by this means
only that the copper-mining industry can continue to
be prosperous in this district, and it must be recog-
nised that the more prosperous an industry is, the
better it is for the workers and ail concerned.
My company has spent hundreds of thousands of
pounds in plants, railways and mines, and without
this capital the country would not be opened up, and
I ask the workers to assist us in getting a fair
return from this capital, and in exchange we will
give them a fair deal, high wages and as good condi-
tions as we can make them.
Judging by the tone of a number of letters
The Bulletin has received, the more intelli-
gent Hampden workers are apparently feel-
ing sore at having had this circular thrust
upon them, and retaliate by pointing out
various economies which, in their opinion,
the co. might make as to management and
working. What justification there mav be
for these complaints this paper does' not
know. But it does know, as the honest Kuri-
dala digger must admit, that general-manager
Huntley’s caution to the go-slow crowd is
more than justified. The I.W.W. disease is
not confined to Oloneurry, but is affecting
the foundations of almost every big industry
in the Commonwealth. The go-slow fanatic
is the workers’ greatest enemy; and
in his own interests the miner who is pre-
pared to give fair value in labor for the 15s.
or so he receives for his eight hours’ work
should insist that his fellow diggers do the
honest thing. Otherwise there can be but
one alternative—closing down and a blank
wages-sheet.

For the half-year to May Cope’s Creek
Central (N.S.W.) handled 245 360 cub. yards
for a return of 97} tons stream tin. Tins
gave a net profit of £7032, and 6s. per share
(£9000) was distributed, which leaves £B6OB
to credit of P. and L. account. As forecasted
at the end of last year, the No. 1 plant at
Cepe’s Creek got into better ground, the
recovery being 1.0831 b. per cub. yard. Tire
ground has been softer, requiring Jess exp o-
sives, and costs were reduced to 9.7 d. per cub.
yard compared with ll.Sd. for the previous
term. The two plants at Skeleton. Creek,
however, have been piling up costs in hard
ground; No. 2 plant recovered an average of
.7771 b. per cub. yard, and costs leaped from
8.4 d. to 11.7 d.. while No. 3 averaged .7391 b.
at a cost of 13d. compared with 9.7 d. in the
previous half. Better returns are anticipated
from both plants during the current. term,
while Cope’s Creek end is tipped to maintain
its recent performance. Capital is £9750 in
30.000 shares paid to 6s. 6d. The eo. owes
£lll4 and liquid assets amount to £3792.

The discovery of silica deposits at Milton,
South Coast (N.S.W.). has created some
excitement in that usually tranquil district.
Tests recently made show 98 p.c. pure silica.
A considerable area has been pegged out by
A. G. Earngey and another, and a couple of
syndicates are negotiating with a view to
securing the output. That there is something
in the show is evidenced by the fact
that Hoskins, of the Lithgow ironworks,
is taking 250 tons to make bricks for his big
blast furnaces, and the Newcastle steel works
are also taking 250 tons. If the bricks
come up to expectations in resisting intense
heat, the deposils should help, forward the
smelting and steel manufacturing industries
of the Commonwealth.

In director Eustace Qt. Heals report on
Edna May Deeps truisms like “efficiency
must be the keynote to ensure success” fly
off his chest like' water out of one of the old
Deeps bores. Heal attacks the plan of break-
ing ore at the shaft’s mouth by hand labor,
and alleges that the intermediate system of
haulage added 4s. a ton to the cost of haulage
for May. So he shouts for “ability and
aggressiveness combined to ensure success.”
Anyway, if things were so bad as Heal pic-
tures, why couldn’t all this have been found
out long ago. Heal’s avowal that the Co.
has “one of the best wealth potentialities” in
Westralia seems uncommonly like sniffing
out what is ahead of the pick. So far no
official word is out that Stuckey is goings
but it’s unlikely that he will let Heal’s criti-
cism go unheeded.
* * * *
From Westonia: —
The principal developments at Westonia lately
have occurred above ground. The inspection of Deeps
by Director E. G. Heal is alleged to have been fol-
lowed by Manager Stuckey’s resignation. One result of
the report, however, is that the cementation process
will most likely be again in the limelight. Stuckey
has patented that process, which he most successfully
applied in holding back the water from the Deeps
workings. If Stuckey should get out, and the process
is further required by the co., which is likely, it will
be interesting to note what royalty Stuckey will ask
for his patent rights. Meantime, a curious public
would like the following information
(1) Distance from the N.E. face 666 ft. level to
Central’s boundary.
(2) Ore reserves available above 566 ft. level and
between 666 ft. and 566 ft. level.
(3) Has the diamond-drill bore-hole which was
officially reported as having struck the Edna lode in
Deeps ground at 460 ft. been yet located? If so,
has the hole been disc losed by stoping ‘ operations
above 480 ft. in Edna May ground? In any event,
a .few assays from samples taken from the vicinity
of the hole would be of interest, in view of the
evidence in the Perth Daily News libel ease.
The Warden having reserved his decision concerning
the Edna v. Consolidated drainage case, the matter
is sub judice. Most of the witnesses, even for the
defence, admitted that the Consolidated workings
were being drained by pumping operations in adjoin-
ing mines, but several were of opinion that it
was the Central and not Edna pumps that were
doing the good work.
The Edna May Co. is anxious to acquire
another property. As a rule this is a sure
distress signal. At present the co. has a pro-
perty at liundip in view, containing' a quartz vein
of good values, though the width of, the ore body
is decidedly slender. After the Edna May works out
its limited ore reserves below 385 ft., and thereafter
ceases pumping operations, it would appear that
mining at depth at Westonia will be possible only
by means of depth bombs.
* * * *
The once-sensational Hill End mine .at
Broad Arrow (VV.A.) is said to be blooming
again. About 150 oz. of coarse gold was re-
cently got out, and the present holders
reckon they have got into some good stuff
underground. About the time Coolgardie
was booming a party of prospectors took
several thousand oz. out of the show’, and
then sold it to a French syndicate for
£25.000. This syndicate started off with
13oz. crushings, and after taking out nearly
20.0000 z. passed the property on to the New
Austral Co. The latter dug out a further
27,0000 z. and then gave up. Some tributors
who followed made money out of a few pil-
lars of ore which had been left behind, and
the mine’s career as a gold-producer then
ended. t *
The Riverina South (W.A.) looks as
though it may breathe again, 11. G. Walton
having at last got the plant in trim. In odd
moments Walton has check-sampled reserves,
which he now gives at ir,SlO tons, worth
545. per ton. A good block of this must be
round the main shaft, for the grubbing done
in other parts of the mine of late has been
in low-grade ore, save for occasional enrich-
ment. Accepting, that Walton can make a
profit of 20s. per Yon, the co. should be able
to get its £OOOO debenture debt out of the
way and have a bit over to prospect the
Riverina lease. But the. mine as it stands
is a poor thing to represent the £BO,OOO odd
in capital account.
k- * * *
The country surrounding the onee-sensa-
tional Londonderry (W.A ) is being tried
again. It was in June, 1893. that this
bonanza was found by one of a party of dis-
consolate diggers who knocked a quartz
specimen from under a bush. Spades were
brought, and in a few minutes a golden
outcrop rivalling even Bayley’s in wealth
was exposed. In one day IOOOoz. were
dollied, and in less than a week 5000 oz. had
been bagged. The first specimen taken out
of the “golden hole” weighed 2401 b. and
was worth £3500. When, the news of the
find leaked out one speculator offered £25 000
for a half interest, but the owners held on
and later sold to Lord Fingall for £lBO,OOO.
The latter floated a co. in Loudon with a
capital of £700,000. but the rich shoot cut
out directly after operations were started,
and nothing, worth much has since been dis-
covered in the neighborhood.
* * * *
From a Westonia critic: —
Edna May's reserves are given (B. 27/6/’18) as
40,260 tons of an average grade of 645. 6d. per ton,
worth £131,000. It was added that assuming Williams
can reduce his costs from 445. 4ld. to 30s, per ton
—a mighty big drop—“he will beat out a profit of,
roughly, 325. 6d. per share.” This is evidently
working on the assumption that an extraction of
100 p.c. will be obtained; but when a very reason-
able loss in residues of about 4s. per ton is allowed
there remains for shareholders only about 28s. 6d.
per share. Further, if the very probable increase
in costs, over and above the 30s. per ton, together
with the cost of exploring the upper levels, are
allowed for, shareholders will be very lucky if they
get a return of even 20s. per share.

Nearly all the tin won nowadays by the
Briseis (Tas.) comes from the Ivrushka flat
excavations —over 100 ft. below the river
level. A little is also got from that failure,
the Mutual Hill lead, and some specs, from
the northern workings. Already Lindesay
Clark lifts swept out of the Krushka
flat 1,859.800 cub. yards for 2221 tons
tin oxide, or an average of 2.671 b.
per cub. yard. As he gets on there,
lie learns the old, old truth of deep-
lead mining, that depth brings poorer wash
and patchy ground. His worry is not over
lower returns, but to. pen back the spurts of
water showing up in the face while the
winter is on. Last year a total of 339 tons
7cwt. tin oxide went to the smelters, com-
pared with 468 tons during 1916. This fall-
ing off was forecasted, but the high price of
tin was depended upon to make up the lee-
way in profits. Clark cannot get out of
present bounds till he lids the Ringarooma
River properly diverted. This means six
months more anxiety and operating in a
narrow cut between the river diversion and
the western reef rim. Still Lindesay Clark
is such a general that everyone expects him
to turn up trumps. The co. made a trading
profit of only £25,966 for the year against
£32,966 for 1916. Then tin was about £lBO
per ton; now it is £340. The first quarter’s
run this year gave 874 tons oxide, for which
£314 10s. per ton was got, so that a nice
profit of £11.500 went into the till. The
Brise’s has two side-shows. At the Wallace
gold-dredging claims in N.E. Victoria, low-
grade ground and high costs put two plants
out of commission, and the remaining plant
has only a few months’ run ahead. The
co.’s other interest is a colliery at Reynol-
ton, in Wales. Twelve months ago this was
“opening up quite in accordance with ex-
pectations.” All that is said of the show in
the present report is that the “reserve fund
has been reduced to £30,000 [from £50,000]
owing to writing-down investment, Reynolton
Colliery.”

North Mount Farrell (Tas.) was loaded
down with trouble during the half-year to
April. Even if there had been no strike, or
scarcity of shipping, the drought would have
seriously affected the half-year’s figures. The
co. sells its picked crudes and concentrates to
the Sulphide Corporation, and as it could
not despatch its output to the smelters pro-
duction w r as suspended for practically the
whole of the first half of the term. As a
result the output dropped to 3084 tons
crudes for the half-year, or less than half
that for the previous term. Here is a com-
parison of recent performances:

Total production to date amounts to 39,3
tons averaging 57.20 z. silver and oi.i P-c-
-lead. The past half-year showed a profat
of only £lOO4 on working account. How-
ever, a considerable amount of development
work has been done recently. The north
drive at No. 4 level is now in 240 ft. For the
last 40ft. this No. 3 lode, 18ft. wide, has con-
sisted of extremely hard slate and quartz in-
term.xed with siderite, carrying a little mill-
ing ore of a very low grade. Another 40it.
to 50ft. should reach the main ore body,
which in the upper levels has proved so pro-
ductive. Meantime the No. 2 lode has been
opened un a further 40ft., showing sft. of
good milling stuff. When labor is available
the co. proposes to open up another level.
No. 5. at 340 ft. Liabilities amount to £9654
and there are liouid assets totalling £13,016.
With lead and silver at present prices the co.
should still be able to make decent profits,
even though costs are h ; "h.
* * * *
Tributors are producing a fair amount of
silver-lead ore on the Zeehan (Tas.) field.
High-metal prices have encouraged many
local syndicates to work some of the aban-
doned shows. A local crowd, assisted by
the Government, has taken on the eastern
workings*of the State mine, which closed
down shortly after the change of Government
without reaching the objectives, and hopes
are entertained of payable ore. The Govern-
ment, which has the power under its Aid-to-
Mining Act, has taken over most of the
ground of any value which is held by cos.,
and gives tributes on a 10 p.c. or 15 p.c.
royalty, a proportion of which goes to the
co. and the Government. This scheme has
worked well, and the State received back
about 35 p.c. on money advanced to assist
tributors. Any tribute taken direct from the
co. is subject to the provisions of the Mining-
Act, which secures to the tributor 50s. per
week before any royalty is payable. In
this way the field has been kept going,
and when the Read-Rosebery electro-metal-
lurgical plant is established in the district,
which will happen as soon as the Govern-
ment is in a position to supply power, it is
hoped that metal producers will be relieved
from the very heavy returning charges that,
are at present being levied.

Hampden-Cloncurry has on Land over a
quarter of a million pounds’ worth of blister.
The contract under which the whole of the
output pf electrolytic copper was sold to
Britain expired in June, and the co. is now
anxiously waiting to hear from John Bull.
And seeing that the old gentleman has
obliged by taking over our zinc and our next
wool clip, the Hampden crowd are quite
hopeful. By the way, the co. recently paid
out £22,151 for war-time profits tax for the
year to June, 1916. Chairman J. L.
Wharton considers that there will be little,
if anything, to pay out of the profits for the
past two years, for despite the record prices
received, increased costs have reduced profits
to below pre-war figures. He also told
shareholders the other day that the advisa-
bility of shutting down, owing to adverse
conditions, had “received careful considera-
tion” by the Board, but that it had decided
to continue operations “for the present” and
hope for the return of better conditions.

Clark’s, Charters Towers (Q.), is handing
out its tenth dividend, a sixpenny, absorbing
£2250. No. 7 and No. 8 levels provide most
of the crushing stuff. A recent clean-up of
457 tons was worth £4524, and although this
is profitable it was comparatively poor com-
pared with some previous crushings. Clark’s
is hauling 100 tons of stone per fortnight
from an Bin. reef.

Golden One, Bendigo, is about to start
crosscutting after getting its shaft to 300 ft.
Below 200 ft. a west leg was cut which will
be driven into from 220 ft. Beyond lies
centre country to be explored. In a modest
way this little show is doing a useful bit
for depressed Bendigo.
* * * *
Last vear Mt. Morgan produced 93,5890 z.
gold; Gvmpie, 33.3590 z., and Charter*
Towers, 30,7840 z. The Towers’ best year
was 1900, when 283,2370 z. were got.
Queensland Mines Minister Jones told the
Geographical Society the other day that
Queensland is the largest producer of molyb-
denite in the world. The output in four
years was 1075 tons, worth £247,000, or
slightly over £230 per ton. Last year’s out-
put was 2424 tons, valued at £69,790, or
less than £3OO per ton. But if Australia was
producing ferro-molybdenum, as Canada,
US.A. and Britain are doing, the molybde-
num industry would be on a better basis.
Queensland may continue to be the largest
producer of raw molybdenite in the world,
but it is a poor business to produce only
for export in the crudest form.

that as the result of using Clements Tonic he can only give it his heartfelt thanks for benefit received.
“CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“ Please accept my heartfelt thanks for your Clements Tonic.
“It is rather soon to report regarding its good qualities. I
have only taken two bottles, yet I appear to have taken on a
new life. My appetite is now good, whereas before taking on
this “ wonder” tonic my stomach usually turned me against the
most appetising meal. Now lam ALWAYS ready for meal time ,
not only this, but I now enjoy my meals without the usual sinking
feeling that for months past followed the taking of even the
lightest meal.
“ Friends advised me to ‘ diet ’ myself. Now there is no need
for it, as, by taking regular doses, either before or after meals, of
your tonic, I find I can eat AND DIGEST almost anything. At
first I tried the Tonic BEFORE meals to induce an appetite ; now
I am always ready for a good meal, and take it AFTER meals, just
to keep the stomach right.
“ Again thanking you, I am, yours sincerely,

Died at Sydney, Charles Jackson Taylor, well
known in IVfestralia and New South Wales copper-
mining and probably the most optimistic man in
Australia. He was optimism in excelxix the last
show was always the greatest and best and the biggest
world-beater that ever was. Taylor used to go to
sleep happily because every night he determined to
walk to the foot of the rainbow —to-morrow. He had
knowledge, but not enough to discount his optimism,
for the contradiction of which there was probably
not enough knowledge in the world, lie got great
dividends out of his sanguineness because his san-
guineness made friends for him everywhere and he
was eminently lovable. He had an artist’s tempera-
ment—which never learns by experience.

Old friend William Moore turned up yesterday m

the army after three years in the Lincolnshire tens.
Cheerful as ever, Bill was about to give a helping
hand (unfortunately minus two fingertips, which
were crushed while handling some heavy bales) to

more than a dozen
illustrated articles on
Australian art for the
most important Lon-
don journals, lectured
before learned socie-
ties, and also for-
warded tidings to Mel-
bourne Herald. He
had the good fortune
to act in a series of
Granville Barker’s pro-
ductions, and in Tree’s
performance of Shaw’s
“Pygmalion,” in which
Mrs. Patrick Campbell
played the leading
part. Shaw often ap-
peared at rehearsals.
“You’ve had the centre
of the stage long
enough,” he said one
day to Tree, ordering
him into a corner;
“but you’re not going
to have it this time.”
Shaw used to write let-
ters of advice to the
mummers, and they
were not always favor-
ably received. “I’ve
had two letters this
m o vni n g from Mr.
Shaw,” said Mrs,
Campbell, looking in-
tense. “I haven’t read
them. They would
only rouse my temper.”
To a suggestion from
Bernard she retorted, “What do you know about
love, Shaw? Some day you’ll eat a mutton chop,
and then God us women!”

“Bildad” butts in
The Hebrew mysteries lately debated in The
Bulletix are simple enough. Israel had a razzle
-—just one. The Hebrew- kingdom took form
under King Saul —an unpretentious wheat and sheep
State about the size of Belgium, not very fertile in
many places and very short of minerals and other-
advantages. King David, an Alexander the Great
so far as his resources went, made it an empire,
helped' hv a standing army, apparently of foreign
mercenaries. When he took Damascus and its terri-
tories he acquired a bigger city than Israel ever
possessed before or since, and a bigger and richer
land, and ho planted himself on a great highroad of
commerce, where there were duties to be collected.
Much revenue came his way, also great war indemni-
ties. When he secured the posts at the head of the
Red Sea he was on another great trade route, where
there were more revenues to collect. Israel became
a place with a massive income. Solomon, the Talka-
tive Married Man, who was no fighter, began to let
things slip, and so the conquests and the sudden
income disappeared. Apparently it took a matter
of about 70 years to get back to the old selection,
with the old simple life spoiled and a lot of over-
large traditions and white elephants (temple, palaces,
etc.) to live up to. When the selection split in two
things were less promising than in Saul's day. Judah
secured the smallest and least fertile part of the
selection —about one-tenth the size of Tasmania —
and the biggest elephant. The country which had
been a sturdy young wench in the empire-builder’s
early days became under his grandson a pair of
rather faded ladies who had seen better times. They
seem to have tried hard to live up to the tradition
of grandpa David’s mansion and his riches and his
estate and his “kerridge,” and to have overdone it.
Even the great empire-builder, when he took the
splendid prize of Syria and the city of Damascus,
was content to slay 22,000 men, while his great-
grandson, with only a fraction of his resources and
no great military reputation, slew 500,000 in one
day; also David never pretended that his whole
fighting population was much bigger than the
alleged standing army of one of his fragmentary
descendants. The great fictions only began when the
great reality had departed, which is common enough.
T. B. Tuivakano, Prime Minister of
Tonga, brings a good story to Australia of a
stubborn old Tongan who annoyed ibis
family by refusing to be converted to Chris-
tianity. The missionary asked the old man
what his objections ‘were. “I’m happy,” be
said Simply. “For years Tongan lias been
my religion. I’m happy. I want no Chris-
tian religion.” “Ah.” said the parson,
stroking bis side-whiskers, “perhaps you
have never bad a proper explanation of the
joys of Heaven, the place where it is always

you ever seen gold?” “Yes, my son hadafive-

are paved with it in Heaven.” “No!” “Yes,
and people do no work there.” “No !” gasped
the old man. “See that bird? Well you'll
have wings like that and fly about all day,
blowing a trumpet and singing, and you’ll
be an angel, all beautifully white.” “Ah.
no!” sighed the old man. “I’m colored. I
would not get a White Australia permit.”
“Don’t be foolish,” said the missionary. “Up
there people are all the same. All happy,
all free.” “Urn. And who is the English
governor there?” “English governor? How

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Shanghaied in San Francisco,
And we fetched up in Bombay,
They set us afloat in an old Leith boat
That steered like a bale of hay.
We panted in the tropics,
While the pitch boiled up on deck;
And we saved our hides and little besides
From an ice-cold North Sea wreck.
We’ve drunk our rum in Portland,
And we’ve threshed tip Behring Strait;
We have toed the mark, on a Yankee bark
With a hard-case down-east mate.
We know the streets of Santos,
The loom of the lone Azores ;
And we found our grub in a salt-horse tub
Condemned tor navy stores.
We know the track to Auckland
And tlie light on Sydney Head;
We have crept close-hauled while the leadsman
called
The depth of the Channel's bed.
We know the quays of Glasgow
And the river at Saigon.
We have drunk our glass with a Chinese lass
On a houseboat at Canton.
*
They pay us off in London;
It’s oh, for a spell ashore ;
Arid again we ship for a southern trip
In a week or hardly more.
It's “Good-bye, Sue and Sally,”
For it’s time to be afloat,
With an aching head, a straw-stuffed hed,
A knife and an oilskin coat.
Sing, “Time to leave her, Johnnie” ;
Sing, “Bound for the Rio Grande,”
As the tug turns back and we follow her track
For a last long look at land.
Then we drop the purple headland,
And the blue alone is seen,
And we toss the bones with Davy Jones
For a stake in Fiddlers’ Green.
AT SEA.

“Ere a hill for a frock that you bought some
months ago. What one was that?"
“That was the one-I wore the night you pro-
posed."
“IE in, Pretty strong when a man has to pay
for his hail and hook."
Uncle Sam’s country held hefty carnival
on Independence Day, when it launched 98
now. ships and 14 destroyers to keep George
Washington's memory green. There is no
record of any public character’s ghost having-
had such a blow-out before.
Some day an Australian Governor may
condescend to explain how many hours a day
he toils for the Commonwealth and exactly
what it is he does. This reflection is born
of the suggestion of Walter Davidson, who
wears the vice-regal plumage in N. S. Wales,
that the time has arrived when the
“workers” (whose contributions to the pub-
lic revenues help to pay the imported figure-
head £lOO a week) will get the opoortunity of
“increasing their earnings” by doing 10 hours’
graft instead of eight daily. His Ex. takes
the view that the change might be not alto-
gether unpleasant. Observations of this kind
coming from a man who knows practically
nothing of the lot of men and women who
labor in Australia’s factories, offices, work-
shops and mines, and still less, apparently,
of the relationship between their wages and
hours of labor, have an odd but not unfamiliar
sound. The trouble is that this kind of critic
can never think in terms of the bread-line.
Let Governor Davidson arise to-morrow,
leave a note for Chief Justice Cullen to hold
the fort, and, clad in appropriate raiment,
with Is. (id. “in liis kick,” proceed to the
environs of Darling Habor and anonymously
hunt round for a job carrying coal, say.
Let this lumper, alias liis Ex., hire
a kennel to sleep in near the waterfront and
hog it at an adjacent hash-trough, and keep
going for six months. Then it will be time
for him. to come into the open and tell his
fellow citizens precisely how much more
pleasant it would have been if he had
wrestled with the coal-basket for 10 hours
instead of merely eight, lie would then be
worth listening to.

An unusual legal opinion has been obtained
by the Adelaide Art Gallery. The Board
of Governors referred to Grundy, K.C.,
the question of legal ownership in the
picture by Wyllie, the British R.A., lately-
found at the back of his painting, “Our
River,” which was bought for Adelaide from
the artist’s studio in ISB2. Wyllie asked
the Board of Governors to take out the un-
known (to them) canvas and dispose of it
for the benefit of a French war-fund
in which his wife is interested. It
seems to have been too much trouble for the
successful young painter to re-strain both
canvases if he separated them when the sale
of “Our River” was made, so he let both
go. The stranger is being shown on an
easel in the Gallery. Grundy says the
ownership is a fine point; but, as there was
no deception, and no mistake on the part
of the vendor, the gift to the French fund
must stand.

“II.”: I recently spent two days at the
chief embarkation port for American forces,
and I felt a sort of comfortable feeling inside
after I had seen their camps. Everything
superfluous has been done away with and
everything retained is standard.
Acres and acres of motor-
transports are awaiting ship-
ment, troops are everywhere, and
all the little irritating details of
the British drill are cut out. The
men wear their bayonets over
the left shoulder, right out of
the way; their kit is in one
bundle strapped to their backs,
and it is comfortable. The
officers mess with the men. All
colored troops are trained in
their own battalions. The’ food
is excellent and the men receive
the equivalent in pay to the
Australians. There are uo
veterans and no “war babies’’ of
IT years, and the ranks are a
dinkum lot. We were the first
of the A.I.F. men to land in
America, and we very quickly
got on great terms with the
Yankees. They are in appear-
ance the finest troops I have
seen, and with a few million of
them to buck us up in France I
wouldn’t be with Fritzy for a
whole lot. About 20,000 of the
Sammies that I saw came from
Halifax in the same convoy as
we did, and all the 10 transports
reached Blighty without sight of
a submarine. So much for Tir-
pitz! A word about Blighty.
The food scarcity is vastly ex-
aggerdted. All that is short is sugar and
meat. In the camps and surrounding villages
there is plenty of food to be obtained without
the least difficulty.

The proposal, laid before the Inter-State
Commission, that women’s clothes should be
standardised is eminently practical though
it may, for a time, knock some of the joy out
of the art and mystery of being a woman.
There are countries like Greece, Alsace,
Brittany, Roumania and Wales (the princi-
pality where woman used to wear a tall
steeple-shaped Puritan hat) that boast or
boasted a national costume, and were proud
of it. Other people who had only mixed
clothes regarded it as a fancy-ball dress, but
to the owners it was a matter of everyday
life, like breakfast or the cat. No woman
required to buy new clothes until the old
ones wore out, for fashions didn’t change.
Then travelling became cheaper and more
common. AVhen the lady in the distinctive
attire of her foremothers went to a cos-
mopolitan city she was stared at in the
street. Small boys ran after her or walked
backwards in front of her. Full-bodied police-
men on point duty tried not to laugh, mirth
being prohibited under regulation 9548. The
lady grew ashamed of her garments for the
first time in her life; also she grew envious
of her more diversified sisters. So one of
the finest institutions of antiquity began to
be eaten by the worm of corruption, likewise
by the worm of monotony, which is a bigger
worm, and biteth like the serpent of a dull
wet Sunday, also it stingeth like a Primitive
Methodist adder. To picture a world-city
like London, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam or
New York in which the multitude of strangers
were attired each in the clobber of his or her
ancestors is to realise how much was lost
when it because the ambition of everybody
who had money to spend on travel to dress
like everybody else, and to do it more ex-
HIS VIEW.
“Do you really flunk this dress suits rue?"
“Oh. yes. suits you ‘down to the ground'!"
pensively and ol'tener. Alexandria, which is
also a world city, reveals in a modified way
what might be but isn’t. Australia has no
national costume—more’s the pity. Why not
compose one and manufacture it locally V
“Hambidge”; These records, all in one
battalion, will take some beating. One
man whose “military” age is 44 years, left
Aussie, after seven of his nephews had been
killed in action. Since reaching Blighty he
has learned that the eighth and last nephew
has crossed over. This old Billjim is the
last of his family that wears collars and
studs. A sergeant with four years’ service
to his credit, has 32 wounds on his body, and
is shortly off to France again. An 18-year-
old boy has a father and three brothers who
have been returned wounded to Dinkum Land.
Another Billjim with several toes off refuses
to quit, and, as, they won’t let him go to the
big noise he peels spuds at the rear.
The crew of the lost ship Wimmera called
themselves “the Jonahs” because most of
them had previously been Hunned on the
high seas before. One of them, in fact, had
been previously Hunned three times, and had
gone to Maoriland “for a rest.” Incidentally
Jonah only went overboard once, and the
ship wasn’t lost; in fact, the Higher Criti-
cism has doubts whether the prophet ever
sailed at all, and fancies that he really got
into trouble with the Fish-god of the Philis-
tines. Patrick, not Jonah, is the example
that should be quoted—Patrick Perkins, the
much-wrecked brewer of Queensland.

“The Oldest Inhabitant” introduces a
boneyard:—•
One of the most interesting cemeteries in Aus-
tralia is that at Kelso (old Bathurst). In it stands
Holy Trinity Church. The original building was of
wood; its register is still in existence, dating-
back to 1826, when the first death occurred, 12 years
after the discovery of the Western Plains. The
church is believed to have been used for some years
before the date of the first entry on the register,
though it does not appear in the list of houses
of worship consecrated in Macquarie’s reign. Cap-
tain Fennell, Civil Commandant, and Lieut. Gore
were buried in the old churchyard in 1826. Thomas
Hassall, son of Rowland Hassall, missionary to
Tahiti and afterwards of Parramatta, was the first
permanent clergyman. Rev. J. E. Keane, a Dublin
University man, was the second, in 1828. The brick
church now standing was built in 1835 and was con-
secrated by parson Marsden. In the cemetery lie
the “forefathers of the hamlet’’-—the Lees ‘ the
Kites,, the Sutters, the Pipers. Captain Piper settled
at Bathurst when he lost his appointment as Naval
officer. The rector of Holy Trinity is Archdeacon
Oakes, a gtandson of Francis Oakes/ one of the
“Duff” missionaries, who became Chief Constable of
Parramatta, his predecessor being' George Barrington,
the pickpocket.
ON THE WAY.
“Ever been over the top, Shrimp?"
“My dear Effie, I'm up to the neck now."
“Badger” ; The other day. my mate in the
navvy gang was wheeling a barrowload of
sand up a steep incline when he lost his
balance, and fell 20 feet on to the hard ground
below. ■ While we were bringing him round
the boss walked up to the barrow. “I’m
if he hasn’t broken it,” he growled.

The love that once I had still lives
With unabated flame;
It matters not. you are not mine:
l love you still the Same —
I mean the same as long ago.
Not as I might to-day,
Had we not. parted when we did
While yet our love was gay.
You are to me as y-ou were when
Our splendid dream upsprung-,
When every blossom gave delight
And all the world was young.
You are not mine, yet all your charms
Are visioned in my heart,
Rut well I know it is because
Our lives were lived apart.
/
No tarnish of the wasting years
The perfect vision mars ;
'Tis fixed with me, as certainly
And lovely as the stars.
The parting hurt, but well I know
Now that its smart is done,
'Tis better to have loved and lost
Than to have loved and won !

A Gift for the Whole Family
The full, rich beauty of any musical composition
is perfectly revealed on a Beale Player-Piano.
With the tempo lever one may regulate
the movement at will; drop from the
merry lilt of ragtime to the slow, measured
beat of the sonata.
The expression lever affords absolute con-
trol of the tone. From crashing chords to
the whispering sigh of a dying Summer
breeze —all are right under your thumb.
Flawless technique alone is just as soulless a thing in a Player-Piano as in a human being. The ability
to correctly interpret is the greatest attribute that a self playing piano can possess. The Beale has a
faultless technique ; but greater than this —absolute control and sweet tone.

“Illawarra” : There are still snobs in Eng-
land, y’ know. One of the youngsters in the
company had a letter of introduction to a
wealthy aunt somewhere north of Blighty,
and promptly wrote to her on landing. -V
reply invited him to spend his leave with
aunty, but please not to bring any mates,
as she had heard that the Australians were,
“we’ll say, rough diamonds.” Two days later
a telegram called the invite off. There were
some officers coming, and, “of course you see
for yourself as a private how awkward it
would be.” A courteous reply raced back from
young Billjim advising aunty that he was
sorry that his batman had mislaid his stars.
However, aunty and uncle might be visiting
Aussie some old time or other, and if they
cared to look him up on the sheep-run all for-
malities would be observed and dungarees
would be provided.
A Melbourne man, Frank C. Snodgrass,
has got an idea of producing rain by going
up in an aeroplane and sprinkling finely-
crushed salt and soda crystals on the tails
of passing clouds. He has got the salt and
soda, but no ’plane, so he has notified the
Commonwealth and State Governments and
pastoral and agricultural societies that if
they’ve got a machine to spare the skit's can
be squeezed like a sponge. It will be a
great saving when every farm has a rain-
chasing ’plane and the cockies fight in the
heavens over every topside bag of moisture.
Then, of course, there will be the ground-level
lawsuits and claims for damage for excess
flooding of crops.
STRANGE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
MISTRESS: “ Mary , there’s a ring at the front door."
THE POMMY: "Oh, you go. Yon know them better than I do.”
“L. 8.”: The fatigue party had just
brought up the breakfast to the front line
when Fritz suddenly opened one of his two-
minute barrages. The first shell landed well
over the trench,
but not far
enough away for
the fatigue party,
which proceeded
to vanish into the
morning gloom.
The X. 0.0. in
charge of the
bacon ration
ejaculated, “This
is no good
to me!’’ and was
about to bolt
down the com-
munication sa p
when a massive
Lewis gunner,
formerly a North
Bananaland bar-
ber, grabbed him
by the neck. “No
youdo n ’ t!
Wh e re’s my
bacon?" Shells
were lobbing all
over the place as
the N.C.O. hast-
ily extracted the
last piece of pig
from the box and
flopped it into the
outstretched dixie
lid. The ex-barber
was scrutinising
it with a sus-
picious eye when
a“Min n i e ”
landed fair on the
parapet. The next
thing I saw was
a very furious
an d vociferous
scarecrow cursing a dixie full of mud minus
the bacon. As a quick-change waitress
Minnie takes the biscuit.
* * * *
“J.A.F.”: A flash coupe dashed up the
main street in Behincourt, the other day,
with a pair of army horses at the pole and
a “digger” coachman and footman on the
box. It skidded to a halt just past the
dump, the “footman” flew oil’ the box and
ceremoniously opened the door. Two more
diggers stepped out and walked languidly
to the canteen window, bought a packet of
fags, and drove off again in a cloud of dust,
every Tommy in the vicinity gaping with
crayfish eyes and 17 military policemen too
aghast to hold up a hand.
“Sol. Malaprop”: Let me otter a contribu-
tion to the Irish question. Ihe trouble
about the real or Celtic Irishman is lack ot
stodge. Too little stodge can produce a race
HER LUCK WAS OUT.
“No, I’m not haring any more soldier bogs.
I've lost five at the war already.”
“All blown out?”
“Worse than that—all married.”
which has every pleasing feature except
material success. AH stodge can produce a
race like the Prussian, who has no pleasing
feature at all except material success. The
attempt to introduce stodge into Ireland
failed because the stodgers were set down in
a colony by themselves, and religious and
other differences prevented them mixing.
Does anybody know where human (not in-
human) stodge of good mixing quality can
be bought?
“Geofred” : An officer friend has just re-
turned after a long spell as prisoner of war
in Germany. He was badly wounded before
being taken prisoner, and- his
treatment after capture was
fearful, until a doctor, discov-
ered that one of his logs re-
quiring amputation would prove
an “interesting case.” Then all
was lovely for a period. My
friend was tenderly handed over
to the most eminent professors
and specialists. Special nurses,
extra attendants and specially
tempting diets were provided
for him, and he almost came to
believe the Hun wasn’t such a
bad fellow, after all. Then
came the operation, and he
never expects, nor hopes again
for such kindness, skill and
attention. The operation (am-
putation above the knee) was
entirely successful, and on
account of the many con-
tributing difficulties —exposure and dirt after
being wounded, loss of blood, gangrene,
slight poisoning, etc. —the skill applied must
have been great. My pal states that the sur-
geons, and in fact the whole hospital staff,
were delighted at the success of what, under
the exceptional circumstances, was a first-
class piece of work. Then came stage three
—-my mate on crutches. From the hour
he took to the sticks to the day he
arrived in Switzerland he was ill-housed, ill-
fed and brutally ill-treated by the very
people who had for a time been more than
humane to him. It all goes to show the
nature of the beast.
* * * *
“Petifi” : The Commonwealth Government
wants .100 more doctors for oversea ser-
vice, and wants them young, because
the elderly or middle-aged sawbones
generally can't stand the strain when pushed
close up into regimental aid posts and
advanced dressing stations. Quite a lot of
people believe that the active-service sur-
geon has a swell berth well out of the way
of hostile interruption. How mistaken that
idea is was shown by a list of casualties
among English, Canadian and Australian
medicoes, published by the British Medical
Journal for April 13, 20, 27. and May 4
this year: Killed in action, 19; died of
wounds, 8; wounded and missing, 2;
wounded, 95; missing, 49; prisoners of war,
11; total for four weeks, 184. If these
figures can be taken as anything like a fair
average, and remembering that sawbones
doesn’t grow in a night like the flowers that
bloom in the spring, it rather looks as if the
problem of filling the gaps will become very
serious if manager Mars doesn’t drop the
curtain on his unholy show’ fairly soon.

“Sar” : W. M. Hughes is like the old-time
actor who happened to make his entrance
just as the Prince of Wales came into the
theatre. The crowd cheered the Prince, and
the unknown Ham-fat bowed delight-
edly. In France, the other day, Hughes
was standing by the roadside with
a general when a batch of captured
Huns passed under guard. A sharp
order was given and the prisoners saluted
the officer. Hughes (or the pressman for him)
took it as a personal compliment, whereas
it was merely part of the usual field routine.
Hughes is the sort, of politician who would
assume that Providence was firing a salute
in his honor if a volcano blew up in his
vicinity.
■ A Scotchbyterian parson, speaking at
Brisbane :
If they turned llell upside down, he believed they
would find it branded ‘‘Made in Germany."
Well, they had to prepare a home for them-
selves somehow.
“Starboard Light”: An interesting docu-
ment recently found a resting place in the
archives of Melb. Customs House. It is the
official register of the Proteus, built in Java
in 1815. After her last voyage from the
Cold Country to Australia this ancient craft
was taken over by Moss’s lighterage firm in
Hobson’s Bay (Vic.), and her last 10 years
have been spent moored alongside Goode
Island, where she is now being broken up.
Alongside her is the Augustus, which beats
the other veteran by one year in the old-age
stakes. Reminds me also of the John
William Dare, up till recently used by Melb.
Steamship Co. as a coal-hulk. This was the
last vessel of the “birth stains” period to
bring out a load of involuntary pioneers. The
Proteus was 151 tons and 93 feet long,
It is not often that the soldier who in-

THE SPARROW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a sparrow on the fence
Outside my window, warning
Me in the name of Common Sense
To note that it is morning.
I want to doze the time away
And dream as is my right ;
Hut that small moralist in grey
Scolds still in my despite.
So 1 arise, and as I may
Face tasks I fain wop Id shirk,
iiiraguring this delicious day
With idiocies of work.
My dreams are all nipped in the bud,
I’m torn from Art and Beauty,
My castles tumble in the mud—
All at the call of Duty.
Whatever I’m inclined to do
In perfect zest and innocence,
Is stopped, because for me (and you?)
There is a sparrow on the fence.

elts Carry All the Power
Klin
tite
Machine overseers with years of ex-
perience in transmission belting most
enthusiastically endorse the use of
Goodyear Klingtite Belting.
Extraordinary claims for belt perform-
ance could not in any material degree
influence this judgment of practical
men who know the severe require-
ments of power transmission.
The continuous service and low maintenance
cost of Goodyear Klingtite Belts have been the
sole factors of Klingtite success in the saw-mill,
power-house, machine-room and factory.
Slipping, stretching, ply separation —these are the
worst enemies a belt encounters. Yet the
Goodyear Klingtite Belt is fortified against all
of these as no other belt we know of.
One fact above all others makes for the growing
use of Goodyear Belting, and that is that Good-
year designers and engineers do not rest on past
laurels —their aim is ever to improve the Good-
year production so that its position now as leader
may be retained for all time
This continual research has given Goodyear
Rubber Belting much longer life, much greater
efficiency, and with all that economy in operation
which power-using executives desire.
When you realise that the conservation of energy and
the transmission of power are largely dependent upon
the belts used, you have at once' the answer to Klingtite
popularity among users of belt-driven machinery.
Klingtite has cheaper “first cost” competitors, but in
the final analysis of all cost it becomes the cheapest belt
to use because of its ability to transmit all the power all
the time without expensive delays or shutdowns.
Klingtite is making new records in Australasia as
elsewhere for long life where hard service makes
necessary the frequent renewal of ordinary belting.
There are few —very few —situations in which Klingtite
Belts will not supplant other belts and do better work
at lower cost.
If you doubt these statements try Klingtite alongside
any other belting under same conditions, and after that
you too will believe in Goodyear quality and Goodyear
service—better work at ultimate lower cost.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Hughes puts his megaphone to the ear of
J. Bull :
llow much is England prepared for peace? What
is wanted, and at once, is a declaration of a definite
fiscal and economic policy. The Dominions are wait-
ing for it. Your welfare depends on organisation.
What Australia is waiting for is the hour
when there will be a Prime Minister of the
Commonwealth capable of doing something
better than dodging his job on the premises and
rushing off crying at the top of his voice to
some distant spot. Whatever may be the
academic merits of this particular yell (which
may mean anything or nothing), this is a cer-
tainty : That here in Australia the Hughes
policy in relation to economic affairs and to
“organisation for peace” has been a long
LIBERTY LEAGUES.
“There is a movement among sporting men to
establish what is to be known as a Liberty League
to safeguard the interests of sport.”
ONE SPORT : “If you want to fight for liberty
why don't you join up with us?”
TOTHER SORT : “You don’t go far enough, my
boy. You only think of saving der race;
we want to save der races.”
nightmare. Hughes has done little except
blither and put the populace by the ears.
His record as a shipbuilder—taking a single
instance —is probably the most disordered
illustration of what could be accomplished
by a top-hole muddler to be found anywhere
on earth. All bawling about “organisation”
in London while Australia blunders deeper
and deeper into economic chaos makes a sane
mind exasperated.
“Economy won’t reduce the cost of the
war” is one of the cheerful Holman’s gags
when told that the State expenditure of N. S. ;
Wales which has practically nothing do '
with war expenditure, is too high. Well,
Australia’s war expenditure paid out of <
revenue has been £24,561,112 up to date,
roughly £6,150,000 a year, of which N. S.
Wales’s share on a population basis is about
£2,337,000 a year—perhaps £2,500,000 in
reality. And the various Ministries with
which Holman was connected, mostly as Pre- '
rnier, have increased the ordinary expendi-
ture of the State by £8.300.000 a year. In a 1
purely ready cash way three wars seem
cheaper than one Holman.
“F. 8.” : The Ryan Government is rioting
cheerfully on down the road to financial
Avernis. With the noble revenue (for a
population of 670,0001 of 8-1 millions the
Government has contrived to achieve a
deficit of £409,000, and Treasurer Theodore
calmly informs a staggered audience that “a
prudent hand has been kept on the expendi-
ture.” Philp had his deficits, but they were
shortages bred largely by drought and a fall-
ing revenue. The Ryan deficits (this is
the third) are the product purely of extrava-
gance. With the biggest revenue ever known
in Queensland the Treasurer has achieved
one of the biggest deficits, and, to enliyen
still more the _outlook, on the morning of its
announcement Justice McCawley announced
from the Arbitration Court further increases
to railway men. In 1916-17 the Railways
went three-quarters of a million to the bad.
and in the year just ended the shortage, when
the figures are sifted out. will probably be
about £1,100,000. This kind of success is
achieved, to the joy of Private Enterprise,
under a Socialistic Government. It is only
fair to admit that loan expenditure is declin-
ing, but that variety of thrift in Queensland
is a purely obligatory and compulsory brand
of virtue. Very shortly Bananaland will be
sitting in the ashes and sharing sackcloth
with W.A.
From a man on the job:—
Hughes and Cook in Blighty constitute a tough
job for the Australian scribe who. from patriotic
motives, is obliged to hail them with enthusiasm as
“representative of the young democracy.” Hughes
Pours forth his streams of facile and futile
rhetoric; but he has character. Cook is repre-
sented best in Hal Gye’s inspired caricature
which suggests the partial materialisation of
a weak spirit, a dim something just faintly emerg-
ing out of the local preacher void. Even the North-
eliffe-Beaverbrook press will find it hard to boom
him. Ilis platitudes are too platitudinous, and he
always says the obvious thing at the most dreaded
moment.
“Trot” wheels in some more arithmetic :
iiie war isn’t going to end next week, so suppose
we think about it in terms of two more r ears. This
is the bill up to the other day:—
Local Borrowings .. ...£149,000,000
From Britain . . . . 47,500,000
Unsettled accounts . . ~ 39,000,000
£235,500,000
Two more years at the same rate as last year mean
another £200,000,000. And the point of this would
be an annual charge for interest and war pensions,
repatriation, ete. (assuming the same rates), of not
less than £30,000,000, which is mighty conservative
figuring. The Commonwealth would at that stage be
requiring gh annual revenue of £55,000,000. Now
the States are taking about £10,000,000 a year by
taxation. Combined, the pay-up all round would
be £65,000,000 yearly. That would mean £l3 per
head of tax. Apart from taxation, the States have
other income—about £40,000.000, so, in two years,
this can be looked for:—•
States’ revenue .. ..£40,000,000
Federal revenues .. . . 55,000,000
£95,000,000
Knibbs reckons that in a year of enormous borrow-
ings the aggregate individual incomes of Australians
were £241,000,000. You can make what conclu-
sions you like from these figures, but when the hot
air escapes it seems to me that the time to get
busy and do some hard thinking will be just about
due—if it isn’t due now.
Maoriland’s High Commissioner Mackenzie
put it this way the other clay at Leeds
(Eng.) :—-
We are going to put up a prohibitive tariff against
German goods after the war. You should secure the
whole of the Australian and M.L. wool clip for
yourselves.
Not a word about Australians working up their
wool-clip themselves. Just the old idea that for
the glory of the race from which they had
sprung Australians must continue to go on
providing raw materials for other people to
convert into wealth and finished products.
And as for the rest — well, if The Bulletin
was addicted to making bets it would give a
shade of odds that if after the war Germany
abolishes the duty on frozen meat prime
Canterbury jumbucks will be pouring into
Hamburg as fast as the ships could carry
them. Tummas ought to see about winning
the war and do his talking later.
Federal Minister Poynton states that he
doesn’t propose to “rush into” the experiment
of building concrete ships. Of course. The
Bulletin takes its oath on a stack of Bibles
that there will be no rushing.
It has been explained officially that the
N. S. Wales Government is as passionately
attached to the decentralisation policy as
ever, but its cross-country railway policy is
hung up for want of money. The cross-
country railway policy can be traced on the
map. It includes (1J connecting the Ten-
terfield-Bydney railway with the Morec-Syd-
ney railway; (2) the Moree-Sydney and
Tenterfield-Sydney lines with the Dunedoo-
Sydney line, which latter is to go on and
connect with the Walgett-Sydney line; (3)
the Dunedoo-Sydney line with the Bourke,
Coonamble, Brewarrina and Cobar-Sydney
lines; (4) the Gulgong-Sydney sine with the
Temora-Sydney line. There is also a plan
for connecting the Wyalong-Sydney line
HOME DEFENCE.
“Herr Wurt (Independent Socialist) said the belief
that Germany could feed herself was erroneous, and
was one of the contributory causes of the war.
He protested against the recent anti-strike measures
at Warnberg, when storm troops in gas-masks, with
machine-guns, intimidated the workers.”
—Ne ws item.
with the Gulgong-Sydney line, which is in
time to be the Broken Hill-Syduey line, and
the Tumut-Sydney line with the Yass-S.vd-
ney line. Thebe are mammoth decentralisers
wandering around these days and shaking
tin- cactus with their feet.
A suggestion floating lightly in the air is
that a committee of two bank managers and
two business men should be appointed to
look after the N. S. Wales finances, it.
being found that even with Holman (Treas-
urer. £1370 per annum), Fitzpatrick (assist-
ant Treasurer. £1370 per annum), the Perma-
nent Secretary (£lOOO per annum) and the
07 subordinates at head office there are
insufficient hands at the pump. It is men-
tioned that the Treasurer and Assistant
T. are too much employed with other things,
but when a. hired financier is too busy to
finance it seems much the same as if a
judge was too busy hen-farming or something
to sit on the bench. The appointment of a
special commissioner to overhaul the Civil
Service has been explained on the ground
that the whole ten Ministers are too busy
with big things to attend to details. (Of
course the Public Set-vice Board is there to
attend to details, but it is further explained
that the Ministry puts the P. S. Commis-
sioners on so many odd jobs that it hasn’t
much time for its own job.) Now it is
suggested that Ministers haven’t time to
attend to the biggest things either.
The Australian Government decides that
it may be necessary to buy up coal with
borrowed money in order to help the indus-
try along, the export trade having slumped
terribly and lost a splendid market for lack
of ships. In the same way the Government
buys up wheat with borrowed money, that
product being also in trouble and losing
the war-price market for lack of ships. Bo
the three big stacks—-coal, wheat and liabili-
ties—will stand up in a row like three pyra-
mids in Egypt, and the lost opportunities
will be a big hole alongside them. The want
of ships threatens to be the end of every-
thing in Australia, for though the little
Commonwealth fleet is said to be paying
solendidly it seems impossible to get any
additions to it built; thus a very rich freight
market is being missed by reason of the same
old lack of ships. If the latest idea comes
oft the Cabinet might look ahead for once
and stack vigorously at Adelaide and Mel-
bourne, else these cities, which have no fuel
supply worth mentioning at their own doors,
nmy run short and suspend business through
both scarcity of ships and famine in trains
Then they would practically cease to be tax-
payers, for it is hard to collect anvthing in
a shut-up city, and there would be less money
and less credit to pay for coal stacking. Also
supplies ought to be planted at big inland
centres which are far from mining centres,
for nothing maddens an inland centre like
raw food for dinner.
A situation which has at least the saving
grace of humor is reported from Newtown
(Sydney) Labor League. It may
not be unusual, but it is funny.
The story is that the league num-
bers about 40, which isn’t many
in a constituency with 11,634
electors (election figures of 1917).
The peace-with-the-Hun-at-any-
price party, which is also the
party which wants local indus-
trial war at any price, is in com-
mand. The violent majority of
the 40 is said to keep its position
by refusing to admit new mem-
bers, however good Laborites they
may be; it is said to have shown
50 applicants the door. This body
—that is, the majority of it, which
may be 21 out of 40—-has the
right, bar accidents, to select the
authorised Labor candidate at a
sitting from which all Laborites
except themselves may be ex-
cluded. All good Laborites are
expected to vote for the selected
candidate, and in a mainly Labor
constituency of 11,634 voters the
number is large, while the oligar-
chy which runs the show is very
small and exclusive. If the party
returns 47 members, nominated
in the first place by Labor
Leagues, then in the secret
caucus 24 of them can decide how
the whole 47 will vote, and the
47 can easily outvote the 43 non-
caucus members. So out of small
beginnings like the 40 strenuous
Leaguers at Newtown big things
may grow. The question that
remains is; With all this care-
fully contrived and carefully-
managed machinery, how much
voice has Newtown Labor voter
No. 11,635 in the affairs of his
State, supposing he doesn’t belong to the
inside ring? Has he the billionth part of a
whisper?
The official representatives in Australia
seem on occasion to forget that George V.,
who is alleged to have democratic views,
may be listening. Within the last
year three of them have suddenly butted
into where the democracy lives with
recommendations to the following effect: That
the time was ripe to employ coolie labor
(Galway, S.A.) ; that criticism of Ministries
in war-time should not be allowed (Stanley
Vic.) : that the eight-hours’ working day
might without disadvantage be made a
session of 10 hours (Davidson, N.S.W.).
The Bulletin is waiting for the next Ex. to
take his courage in both jaws and get a cheer
from Buckingham Palace by loudly remark-
ing that a country which spends £06,412 a
year on Seven Cocked Hats is a blithering
travesty on democracy and commonsense.

THE CRIME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One of the charges against Baron Yon Kuhlmann is
that he has been seen in the company of ballet
girls.— Cable.
Oh. wowsers all, we do not mind the slaughter;
\Ye wink at Belgium's fate of blood and rape;
We laugh to hear that some old Frenchman’s daughter
Decks her Hun baby dolefully with ora pc.
Kuhlmann may slip the hellhounds of invasion;
Kuhlmann’s may he the hand that havoc hurls;
But we’d forget such damnable occasion—
Only, the scoundrel talks to ballet girls!
How can we Huns wage war unless we’re wowsers
And mix with blood the snuffiebuster’s slime?
Wo dress the pagan brave in soldier’s trousers,
While skulking at headquarters) all the time;
We stain a continent with bloody murther ;
The pirate sail our pirate never furls;
Slaughter is decent, but this swine goes further —•
lie actually winks at ballet girls!
Wilhelm, the great Arch-Wowser of the earth,
Will tear his hair out when he hears the news
That crime in Prussia has a monstrous birth
That discounts death and battle’s bloody dews.
Holy tlic burning farmhouse is to God!
Sacred the murdered children’s bloodied curls !
But Prussia now is humbled to the sod.
Since schweinhund Kuhlmann talks to ballet girls!

TRYING SOMETHING NEW.
There seems to be a weakness in H uman Nature to try everything new that comes along. This
is so well known that certain clever people are continually bringing new things, or rather old
things with new names, to catch these inquisitive folk. Most of these things have little or no merit,
and are tried once or twice and then discarded. When the Public continues to take a remedy like
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills year in and year out there is a good sound reason why
They try the other things but soon find something wanting, and they come back to the reliable
remedy that they can depend on. There is no use saying “Don’t waste your money experimenting,”
because it will be waste of time. Trv these things bv all means. Irv internal lubrications and
fill your system with mineral oil to do the work of the Bile, Nature’s own lubricant. Try every
new brand of salts on the market, every new tablet that has claims made for it that any kind of
food can be taken in any quantity if only this tablet is taken to digest it. Try them all, and soon
it will be found there is something lacking. There will be something that does not seem just right
in the after effect, and then come back to Dr. MorS©’S Indian Root PHIS and note the
change. There is a general feeling of satisfaction and buoyancy not experienced from these
other so-called remedies. This is what has occurred for years. After trying many experiments
with things that are heavily boomed, it is found that the satisfactory result is absent. The reason
is very simple. In Dr. MorSO’S Indian Root PillS there is a proved combination of
ingredients that form one compound that is highly efficient for the Liver and Allied Organs, not
merely flushing the system as these other remedies do without getting at the cause, but aiding in
the digestion of the food, and above all acting definitely on the Liver. This is the secret of the
difference, and the reason why many of these new fads are tried a few times and found so ineffective
that they are quickly abandoned, and Dr. MorSO’S Indian Root PillS again resorted to
and found to accomplish everything that is claimed for them.

stores. Ladies recommend them. Be sure
you get the genuine with the signature:

"But”: “E.R.P.’s” story of the Yankee
seekers of Ben Hall’s plant of gold (B. 13/6/’18) is
correct so far as the two Yanks go, but otherwise he
has the bull by the tail. The spot where they
made the excavations is on a hill ‘25 miles west of
Grenfell (N.S.W.) and close to where the division
of the bushranger’s spoils took place. I (age 27)
happen to be “the venerable cocky” who “E.R.P.”
says directed the Yankees to the spot. They needed
no directing; they simply borrowed tools from me
and persuaded an old man employed by me to give
them rations, promising him a share of the treasure
if successful. They did not work by moonlight, and
they were six weeks on the job. They left as unos-
tentatiously aS they came, and I fear they were too
tired to curse their luck. “E.R.P.” says that I
“hobbled to the spot, which was a couple of hundred
yards from the house.” It is five miles from iny
house and in rough country. When I saw the exca-
vations I was hobbling round the hills with a rifle
after foxes. Next time I’ll go out after paragraphists.

“Hay”: Now that many abo. tribes have
completely died out the correct translation of native
names of places must be largely guesswork. In the
early days Binghi’s pronunciation of an aboriginal
place was rarely correctly followed by the
careless white fellow. He generally called it some-
thing with a more or less similar sound which was
easier to remember. Billjim now in foreign parts is
re-christening places in the same way. Badgercarna
in the far-west of N. S. Wales was originally, named
bv the blacks Pychoocarnoo (red stone). O’Leary, in
North-east S. Aus., was lately brought into prominence
on account Of its radium-mine, and a newspaper para-
graph stated that it was named after an Irish well-
sinker. Fifty years ago when Binghi roamed and
hunted in the locality he called it Willara, and not
far from Willara was Ordtupa, which has long since
been altered to Otulpa.
* * * *
“Laiitana”: The cringing, cadging, frowsy,
unpicturesque old blackfellow is no more, thank
goodness. At Coraki (N.S.W.) the other day one
boomerang-thrower greeted the Governor with: “Good
day, sir. God bless you,” as he shook hands. “Thank
you,” returned his Ex. with a surprised look. “A
very fine sentiment, indeed. I could wish for none
better.” God knows why the stranger should be sur-
prised—unless, perhaps, he has been reading Captain
Cook’s voyages.
“Nor’ West”: Where did “Te Whare” get
his ideas qf the wood swallow? “Dr. Nil” (B.
13/6/’’18) is quite right—the wood-swallow
and bee-eater are two entirely different birds.
Both are migratory to north-west N. S. Wales.
The bee-eater’s beautiful plumage and long
spines or plumes from the tail are distinctive
features. It builds in an entirely different
manner to the wood-swallow, making a long
tunnel in the ground, in which it lays its
eggs. These are pure white and almost spheri-
cal in shape. I have found up to five in a
nest. Its destructiveness to bees is a matter
of opinion, but I have seen any amount of
the birds in country where apiaries are non-
existent. There are three distinct types of
wood-swallows—“dusky,” “white-browed” and
“masked.” The bird appears in great numbers
in the north-west about the middle of Sep-
tember, and it likes “rung” country and
dead timber. The wood-swallow has a peculiar
habit of twirling its tail when perched on a
limb. I have found dozens of its nests in
the hollow tops of old stumps, set between a
slab of bark and the trunk of a tree. '“Woody”
is not much of an architect, and the home is
a rude affair made of grass, roots and very
small twigs. The eggs are of a very light
greenish color, blotched and mottled with
brown. Woody is a valuable insectivorous
bird, no matter what evil reputation the bee-
eater labors under.
“Tilga”: “Yairs,” said Dave, “I’ve heard
o’ that there pickle-bottle cure for boils. The ole
man had a bad ’un a year or two back, and a cove
he knew tried to tell him how to cure it.
Y’ know the ole man’s way—listens to about half and
then reckons he knows the lot. Well, he get’s a
pickle-bottle and fills it with boilin’ water. The
bottle breaks and the water scalds his hands and
splashes down his shins. The ole man d’Alberts a few
and then has another go at the cure. He gets the bottle
full this time, but doesn’t remember about the
emptyin’. He claps the bloomin’ thing on to the
boil, gives a yell and a jump, and the
water runs all down his off-side leg. It’s a week
before he can bear to put his pants on. That saved
the life of the bloke who introduced the remedy.
When dad went to look for him he’d sold out.”
HARD LUCK.
“Yes, sir. Things is serious. The ’usband of the woman newt door is at the war, and
now she goes out in silk and satin.'”
“Ah! Is that so?”
“Yes; and I've taken my old man to the Rcermtin' Office an? they refuse to ’ave Am.”
Notice scrawled on the wall of his hut by
a Bananaland timber-getter
You all take this notice. I have gone to fight
the Germans, and I don’t know when I’m coming
back, somebody chip round my -humpy against
grass fire. All my bullocks is sold except Sambo,
him with the cockhorn. Anyone finding him can sell
him to the butcher and mind the money till I
come back.
Sambo has been collected and his price (£ll 165.)

with the old waggon rusting outside, or the gear

“W.”: Barring the great grey-blue wonga
wonga, I think we haven’t any pigeon which is
partly (as the wonga is) insectivorous. The wonga
is a mighty tradesman where white ants (termites)
are concerned. No menu is more to its taste, and
the same may be said of the yellow-throated scrub-
wren (“devil-bird”), more greedy and always bolder
than the wonga. “Let the little beggars alone and
they’ll feed till they nearly bust,” said a son of
the broadaxe. Most sleeper-cutters, by. the way,
have birds about their tents with whom they never
interfere. The comparatively shy wongas, for in-
stance, sometimes perch on the ridge-poles, but the
common magpie (crow shrike) and butcher-bird make
themselves still more at home. One timber-
hew'er, by w r ay of variation, had a friendly diamond
snake (lady) dwelling near his tent under a large beer-
case. This abandoned female converted to her own
use sundry scraps of rag and paper lying about the
tent and interwove them among the bark, dry
grass, leaves and bracken of which her nest was
formed. The theft was probably committed during
the night, when the diamond hunts its prey and
incidentally seizes birds while asleep on their
perches. Have often seen the big python’s track,
too, leading into rabbit burrows, but as this snake
can do with a meal about once a month it isn’t
a cardinal factor in the work of keeping bunny’s
birth-rate on the down grade.

“D.F.”: Tasmania’s long since extinct
Black Brother had an early-developed and most-
gorgeous appetite, according to some of the old-
timers. One early settler, O’Connor, alleges that he
saw an eight-months-oid child eat a whole kangaroo-
rat and then start on a crayfish. Ogilby, another
early observer, asserts that it was not out of the
way for a blackfellow to put down 121 b. of meat
at a meal. Even after the blacks had been moved
to Flinders Island, and were, according to tin-
romancers, pining away of homesickness and sitting
on the shore all day straining their eyes to catc-h a
glimpse of their native land, the aborigines were

THE HAPPY EXILE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some trees were hidden by hedges tall, and some
leaned over the winding track.
The sea-wind muttered till evenfall, and the shivering
tree-tops answered back.
The tapering eyprus-stems were bent, and feathery
palms swayed to and fro,
But portly and tall and well content a gum-tree
sang in the afterglow:
“I felt forlorn in my sapling- days, when a dense
, and motley company
Of strange trees fashioned a selfish maze to banish
the light of day from me.
But soon I learned I was born to rise and bustle
my branches wide and high,
And trees were shrubs in my laughing eyes when I
gazed with glee on the open sky.
“Then war swooped down on a startled earth, and
men marched out of the North and East.
The big guns shattered the voice of mirth and death
sat down to a lengthy feast.
I waited long, while the men crawled back, all
haggard and worn and battle-spent,
And shells crashed down on the tree-fringed track,
till the sky was dark with discontent.
“And out of the South and West there rose the
clash and clamor of men that fought.
1 saw the glimmering steel flash close, and the glint
of blood in their eyes I caught.
And under my leafy limbs they, swayed, then hurtled
by in a .cursing flood,
But ere they’d vanished I saw the blade that spat-
tered my bole with Turkish blood.
“The fight rolled north, and after a while tall men
strolled over and peered at me,
And one man gave me a friendly smile and said
‘Ole man, you’re a bluegum-tree!’
Then around about my roots they sat: their laughter
severed my heart from gloom.
While out of the band of each man’s hat there blos-
somed a trailing emu plume.
"They pillowed their heads on weary arms, and
they made my sap within ine leap—
They spoke of bluegum forests and farms, and
yarned of corn and cattle and sheep.
They kindled a blaze with leaves I’d shed, and
boiled their billies within my shade —
I listened intent to all they said till the falling sun
began to fade.
A SOCIAL CALL.
"Is the lady of the louse in?”
"Yes; what do you want?”
“Tell 'er a gentleman ’as called ter see ’er.”
“1 listened until I’d surely learned of boundless
forests beyond the sea,
I’rom men who’d traveled and toiled and burned
the leaves of many a bluegum-tree.
The wind made moan through my limbs at length,
and my green leaves lisped ‘Remain, remain!’
But each man rose in his goodly strength and said,
‘Farewell till we meet again!’
“They rode away through the ,languid night and left
me alone to muse and sigh,
But the sea-breeze brought me keen delight till my
branches sang to the starry sky.
Oh, never before such men I’d seen behind a blade
or a loaded gun.
And I shall ever be glad to, screen their weary heads
from the burning sun.
“Whenever they pass my way again I’ll shake my
, leaves in the fragrant breeze,
And under my welcome arms they’ll faint forget their
troubles, and sit at ease.
Their yarns shall riddle my heart with glee, for
they are true to the land afar
That sent them over the Indian sea to win their
spurs at the game of war.”

REG? NAME FOR
MEAN’S ESSENCE
A TRAGEDY (A Dirge)
By HENRY LAWSON.
Oh, I never felt so wretched, and things never looked so blue,
Since the days I gulped the physic that my Granny used to brew;
For a friend in whom I trusted, entering my room last night.
Stole a bottle of Heenzo from the desk whereon I write.
I am certain sure he did it (though he never would let on),
For he had a cold all last week and to-day his cough is gone;
Now I’m sick and sore and sorry, and I’m sad for friendship’s sake
(It was better than the cough cure that my Grauny used to make).
Oh, he might have pinched my whisky and he might have pinched my beer.
Or all the fame or money that 1 make while writing here;
Oh, he might have shook the blankets, and I’d not have made a row
If he’d only left my Heenzo till the morning, anyhow.
So I've lost my faith in mateship, which was all I had to lose
Since I lost my faith in Russia and myself and got the blues;
And so trust turns to suspicion, and so friendship turns to hate,
Even Kaiser Bill would never pinch his Heenzo from a mate!

The treatment of Asthma, Bronchitis, Colds, Influenza and Sore Throats calls for
something that will' destroy disease germs from the throat and bronchial tubes, soothe
and heal inflamed mucous membrane, loosen phlegm, and tone up the general system.
For this purpose money cannot buy a better medicine than that a pint of which
anyone may prepare in their own homes in a few moments by adding HEENZO (regis-
tered name for Hean’s Essence) to warm water and sweetening as per easy directions
supplied with each bottle. As HEENZO costs only 2/-. and a pint of ready-made cough
mixture would cost at least 12/-. it will be seen that a big money-saving is to be effected
bv making your own cough mixture. If you do not need a family supply of cough
mixture, ask for HEENZO COUGH DIAMONDS, price 1/ per tin.

“Veronal" : Don’t associate with kings as

is Biamanga, and he rules over the aborigines of the

Coast (N.S.W.). lI.M. is one of the last full-blooded
warriors left of the South Coast tribes, and has one
front tooth knocked out, in pursuance of an ancient
(and now disregarded) abo. custom, which marked
arrival at manhood. Asked royalty what it would

a vein of it worth prospecting. Of the spirit
of a long-departed brother he said: “He go
into a killer,” the little dog-toothed whale which
worries the big whale to death. “I saw him once,
at Eden, and his eyes looked up at me out of the
killer’s head.” The “Gub’ment” decorated the
monarch with a brass breast-plate, on which his
titles and insignia are engraved ; but he rarely wears

not yet established itself in S.A.” H. W. Andrew,
botanical assistant, added on his own account that
there is a lamentable absence of joint action between
the States on seed matters:—
There are at least 90 alien weeds in Vic. and N. S.
Males quite unknown in S.A. Still worse, so lax is
our vigilance that we actually allow the seeds of
weed proclaimed noxious by the Commonwealth or
the other States to be imported, tinder their true
name. Thus, seeds of Lycinm horridum,< one of the
boxthorns, proclaimed for the whole of Victoria, were
recently imported, there being no power to prohibit
their entry.

“Barcoo”: “Bouragi" (B. 27/6/TS) com-
plains that my monster, C. Queensland sand-frog, is
a midget compared to the giant species found in
inland Papua. Let it go at that. I claimed only the
Australian championship. Now, has “Bouragi” been
introduced to the famous flying-frog- of Borneo?
This curiosity has the faculty of inflating an air-
tight membrane attached to the outsides of its hind-
legs, and when it pumps air into its balloon the
rest can float from one tree branch to the other.
But that’s nothing. The most interesting inhabitant
of frog-land is the singing fellow. He is to be
found, but not plentifully, near the Rockhampton
coast (C.Q.). It is generally perched in the branches
of shrubs, particularly in the unclosed shrubberies
attached to pubs. It so resembles the foliag'e of
shandygaff as to be almost indiscernible except by
the sense of smell.
Lopped off in action, Private Jock McCaf-
frey, the champion sawyer of the North Coast, where
he used his ironmongery in every mill from Beilinson
to the Tweed.
“A Bloke from the West”: This is how to
tan ’roo skins. Soak them till soft, then thoroughly-
clean and scrape off flesh, fat, blood and dirt' (a
piece of brick is as good an implement as any,
better, for it’s safe to say it’s not imported) ; then
well rinse in clean water. This cleaning must not
he slummed if soft good skins are wanted. Now
take three parts of alum to four parts of common
salt and dissolve in rain water. Three pounds of
alum and four pounds of salt should do 25 ’roo skins.
The material, however, is so cheap that it is worth
while giving the skins a second fresh bath for two
or three days after they have been in the first bath
for a week. The skins must be taken out- once a
day and put back in a different form. See that they
are well covered, so that the solution gets to every
part. After this soak for 10 or 12 hours in plenty
of clean water to take out the surplus salt and alum,
for only that which is combined with the material
of the skin is vented and all excess tends to make
the skin stiff". The water should be changed once
or twice. As the skins are taken out of the water
turn them skim side up and give them a good ser b-
bing with warm water and soft soap. Rinse well;
ling out and hang to dry. As they dry put them
over a smooth log and rub till they are soft. To
obtain softness get some olive-oil and rub in with a rag
The drying must be done in the shade. What i want
to know now is whether the Abo. who explained
how to dye "possum skins black two or three years
ago will kindly oblige again.

“Adelaide”: Does one have to go abroad
to buy flamingoes? Minchin, of the Adelaide Zoo,
has been explaining that the number of his specimens
was reduced through the want of water in the 1914
drought, fie can now muster only six, and the re-
inforcements, which could easily be obtained in
normal times, are blocked by shortage of ship space.

“Bill”; The homing instinct of “Jimsey’s”
bush prad (B. 28/3/T8) was only a stroll round his
familiar home paddock compared with the sagacity
of a city-bred tabby cat of my acquaintance. My
brother humped the she-devil from Parramatta-street,
Sydney, in a sugarbag, taking all the short cuts
possible through smellful Surry Hills and Darling-
hurst, while the prisoner hadn’t the ghost of a chance
of taking her bearings. On arrival at our suburban
mansion in Rose Bay, and before liberating the
infuriated captive Mum assured us that butter
plastered on her feet would induce the cat to take
kindly to her new home. It took a whole family of
excited bush-whackers to accomplish the butter-
spreading business, and during the commotion puss
scratched her way to freedom and made a lightning
dash for the door. When my brother reached Parra-
matta-street next morning puss was on the doorstep
to give him a cordial welcome. She had steered her
course through empty suburban spaces, then dived
into the heart of the city from east to west, dodged
the traffic and beat milk-oil before breakfast—a
matter of nine miles.

“8.N.J.” : About tln-ee months ago, during
a shortage of ordinary strychnine, I was able, to
procure only a few ounces of muriate of strychnine
(soluble in water), and have been using it ever
since with disastrous results to Jack Crow. Off my
own bat I can account for over 100 corpses,
and a blackboy 1 have here has collected a bonus of
one penny per head on 173 bodies. I had far better
results with this strychnine than I ever had with
s.a.p. In several instances I have found the doped
birds upwards of half a mile from the nearest poison
with both legs paralysed, but still able to fly.
Hi ought one or two home to watch developments,
and they all turned in their marbles in a couple of
hours.

“Dali”: In the West, where boils and
sandy blight were yearly visitors, we always used a
limp glass, instead of a bottle, as a steam poultice,
and by placing a hand to one end, covered with
cloth, the operator could remove the power at once
and give instant relief.

Terry Hy Hie”: It doesn’t require
whisky to find a snake in an unusual spot. While
boring at Perks’ oxide-mine (North Coast) a few
weeks ago the contractor in examining the cove
brought up by the machine found a bandy-bandv
snake, quite uninjured, in the dirt. The striped
wriggler was 28in. long. After being shepherded
into a bottle he was sent to the Sydney Zoo.
* * * *
“Joyce”: At Sydney Zoo some Sundays
ago I saw two snakes together in a' cage, one a
brown, the other a black, both about three
feet long, the brown fellow slightly the larger.
A keeper threw in a frog. In the tussle "for
the dinner the brown crawler won outright.
Intent on reprisals the other chap grabbed
browrfy by the back of the neck and gradually
worked his way with his mouth to his oppo-
nent’s nose, biting- all the time. He then pro-
ceeded to swallow him! When I left, Mr.
Brown was down south with the exception
of about 6in. which had still to be interned.
“Billjim Abroad'’: Thinking of Keats
and Matthew Arnold on the nightingale, Shelley
on the skylark, and all Scotchies on their
“mavis,” I waited impatiently to hear the throaty
marvels. I have heard them. Possibly we
should hand the medal to the nightingale. He is
really fine. Without doubt he gets his thrilling
effect by good stage-managing-. Singing- into the
stillness and the mystery of night, his song- grips the
heart as no daytime, musician could do. It’s difficult
to make comparisons, but I believe the nightingale’s
tone is less mellow and less rich than the Aus-
tralian white-shouldered 'caterpillar-eater. The lark
and thrush are both line songsters; but at home we
have dozens better, even amongst the commoner
birds such as the silver-eye, blue wren and white-
throated fly-catclier. There is nothing in England to
equal the fluting of our butcher-birds or magpie
carols; and the biggest fraud of all is the “robin
redbreast.” He. isn’t red; lie’s just a shabby little
brown chap with a dusting of brick color on' his
shirt-front. Me for my old friends back in the gums.

RECORDS THAT COUNT!
The value of a Record as a Tyre Test should be judged by days and hours, not by
seconds. Any poor grade Cover will stand for seconds, but the longer “Dunlops”
are under test the more marked and pronounced is their Superior Quality,
Strength and Dependability. WHEN IT COMES TO RECORDS —has any
other Tyre in Australia established such a Record for Speed and Durability as
DUNLQP TYRES
Look at the classic “overland” drives—these ARE TESTS— a bit different to short
hill climbs or mile speed stunts which are magnified into great tyre performances. Here
are the CLASSIC ROAD RECORDS OF AUSTRALIA HELD BY “DUNLOPS.”

Train by 50 minutes. v
MELBOURNE TO ADELAIDE (594 miles) by Mr. M. Aunger, in 14 hours 54 minutes-beating the Express
Train by nearly 2 hours.
BRISBANE TO SYDNEY miles > by Mr. Boyd Edkins, in 26 hours 3 minutes-beating the Express
Train by over an hour.

and best uniform, the Ministry find all mem-
bers who don’t belong to tue party. Ihe
sergeant-at-arms can be dispersed and the
Provisional Government proclaimed on the
doorstep. Another good time is the middle
of a general election, when there are no mem-
bers, only candidates, many of them un-
successful. The general election, in fact, is
incomparably the better time. In a big
capital city it can be arranged that fsay) lu
candidates, nominated for the purpose, shall
deliver impassioned speeches to the electors
from .15 carefully-selected pub-balconies, fit
1.15 p.m., when most citizens are busy with
lunch. Fifteen chosen detachments with
concealed weapons will gather to hear the
candidates. When the post-office clock
strikes 1.30, and lunch is still unfinished,
these detachments will move. Five, say, will
invade the five principal banks, and this is a
time when the safes are open and all the
keys on'the premises. They will take not
only the money but the securities and books
to the revolutionary headquarters. One
detachment will seize the railway station,
and stop all outgoing trains and take the
cash. One the G.P.0., where it will dis-
connect all telephones save those required for
the use of the Cause, whatever that may be.
One will occupy the military headquarters,
annexing all papers and putting all dis-
affected officers in gaol. The rank-and-file,
except those that are in the movement, will
be disarmed and invited to follow the flag of
liberty. The Treasury will be treated the
same way as the banks. There will be soine
detachments left to occupy strategical posi-
tions, and these can be reinforced when the
other operations are finished.
The great essential is that the detach-
ments should march straight for their objec-
tives. They must arrive to the second. They
must not stop for tramcars, funerals, police-
men, dog-lights, free drinks or abusive lan-
guage. If the news lias leaked out and ill-
conditioned citizens are throwing pianos on
them from balconies they must set their
teeth and go straight on. Vengeance will
wait. The revolution won't wait. A single
hitch, say in the seizure of the railway sta-
tion or the post office, may put everything
askew.
The first crisis happens after the first
success. Perspiring deputy-leaders return
flushed with success and want to hold forth
at a Council of War about future operations.
Perspiring deputy-leaders must be Sent away
separately on dangerous outpost duty. If
they refuse to go there is nothing for it but
to shoot perspiring deputy-leaders on the
spot.
The second crisis arises when the leader
linds that he doesn’t know what to do next
except have tea, and learns that his col-
leagues in some other big city or cities have
failed to connect.
The big crisis comes later, when the easy-
going Premier, made affable and oily by the
habit of greasing the electors, is superseded
bv some iron-jawed dictator who knows how
to organise an army, and starts a real war
just when the revolutionists had settled down
to cakes and ale. This kind of man may
even offer a bio- reward to any private who
brings in the head and feet of an officer.
In an appendix the talented Napoleon
Schmidt specially reprehends the pract.ee of
revolushing on Sunday. The insurgents can
certainly assemble under pretence of being
congregations, but churches are fewer than
pubs, and often badly placed as regards the
points to be attacked. No pub is badly
placed as regards auything. Besides an un-
exampled rush of piety would arouse sus-
picion. Then on Sunday it would be neces-
sary to get at the banks’ treasure with dyna-
mite, the men with the keys being away, and
important personages would evade capture
through being at the seaside with other
men’s wives.
The book is written in an interesting style
and accompanied by maps, statistical tables
and pictures. One picture shows an un-
successful revolutionary leader being flayed
alive in Morocco, and another deals with the
wiping out of 1400 of the rank-and-file with
cannon. [To be published by the Anarchist
Press. Our probable copy from the Irre-
ligious Tract Society’s Bookstall.]
Photo-play Competition
The promoter of the Photo-Play (Australian)
Competition, which was advertised on the Red
Page some time ago, announces “Jack North’’ as
the winner. There was nothing in the conditions
of the competition to prohibit the use of a pen
name or a. P.O. address, but Tiie Bulletin has 136011
shown the real name of the winner, who is a well-
known Sydney man, and it has satisfied itself that fie
lias been handed the prize of £5O. Thirteen stories
were It ft in at the final judging. The story adjudged
to best fulfil all conditions, “The Call of the Bush,”
will be exhibited on a Sydney screen shortly.
The first part of Admirals of the British
Navy (Cot; a try Life, London; 55.) con-
sists of portraits in colors by Francis Dodd
of a dozen admirals, beginning, of course,
with Jellicoe. Most of these are practically
unknown to the general public. _ A curious
point in the biographical notes is that most
of the® o °drnira!s were, at some period of
their service, aides-de-camp to the King. One
wc ’d r >t imagine that a budding admiral
could learn much of Ins profession by becom-
i a gentleman-help. There is a general re-
semblance in this group of faces. As the
writer of the foreword says: “Most of the
admirals look like admirals —and is there a
better tiling to be?’’
“V.”: Many angry protests against the
Crown Law Office have been heard of late
in the Sydney Press Club, owing to the
growing practice of requisitioning A.J.A.
men as witnesses in industrial and political
prosecutions and substituting reporters’
notes for John Hop’s more or less shorthand.
Pressmen, particularly those who do- Trades
[fall and Labor woik, are in the confidence
of union officials and others, and once con-
fidence is disestablished unpleasant rela-
tionship begins. During the conspiracy
charges heard on the heels of the 1017 strike
the N. S. Wales district of the A.J.A. viewed
with dissatisfaction the subpoenaing of
three reporters by the Crown Law Depart-
ment ; and the growl developed into a roar
recently when four members of the A.J.A.
were hauled along to the Central Police
Court as Crown witnesses in the Judd cases.
The Labor Council meetings, out of which
several of the charges against Judd arose
were open to press, public and police; but,
though the Crown Law Department must
have known that plenty ol hot air would be
pumped out, it “ducked” from taking a
note." Tbe A.J.A. is going to have a word
with both State and Federal Attorneys-
General in an endeavor to eliminate un-
necessary utilisation of reporters as police
witnesses.
The Inky Way
“The Moth*’: Jack Davidson, a remarkably
able journalist, and one Of the whitest men
on the inky way, has resigned the job of
editor-in-chief of Melb , Herald. In the long
ago Davidson was secretary to Bigjohn For-
rest, and had a wide journalistic experience
before coming to Melbourne to jo n the
Argus. Although one of the sturdiest of
democrats, he was for some years the star
political man on the Tory organ, until offered
the dual job of associate-editor of the Herald
and ed'tor of the Weekly’Times. A while
later Reay went to represent the Herald. in
London, and “Davey” became editor-in-chief.
Under lrs direction the paper was improved
immensely. Guy Innes, news editor under
Davidson, becomes editor.
Oliver Hogue (son of “Jimmy” Hogue,
ex-Minister for Education, and “Trooper
Bluegum” by pen-name) writes from Pales-
tine that he is fit and well. “Have just had a
very rough couple of months over the Jordan,
around Jericho and along Wadi Auza, and
the old I.C.C. did splendidly, winning the
special congratulations of General Allenby.
Saw Harry Gullett (one of Australia’s war-
correspondents) out on the Amman stunt. He
should be able to get a good story out of it.
I’m getting all my fugitive verses together,
and will have them published in aid of the
Australian Red Cross.”
“Nocoleche”: Seems to be part of the
Argus’s business to supply the evening
papers with pressmen. On Melbourne
Herald, for instance, these men have
come from the Collins-street office: Edi-
tor-in-chief, news-editor, cable sub-editor,
printer (at present in khaki), one sporting
reporter and one senior reporter (also in
khaki). On Sydney Sun staff the following
were formerly Argus supports: Editor-in-
chief, Sunday editor, editor of “daily,”
leader-writers and cable sub. There does
seem to be something in an Argus training,
after all.
Sydney Telegraph mad * one clear point
the other morning. One Edward A. Little-
john was stumbled across in the bush with
his throat cloven; the awful wound was
septic; the man had been lving in the scrub
for five days after he had performed tin-
operation. “Last night.” said the Tele-
graph, “Littlejohn’s condition was regarded
as serious.” That made the obvious apparent.
“Oxford English M.A.”: Was it the re-
porter or the Chinaman V In the Sun report
of a fatal Sydney fire a Chinese furniture-
maker, who raised the alarm, was made to
talk like this: “I was returning from the
Masonic Lodge some time after
midnight, when pungent smoke assailed my
nostrils.” A plain Chow would probably
have raised the alarm quicker. Too much
nostrils and pungent smoke make a man slow
on his feet.
At a Red Cross sale in London the manu-
script of Thomas Hardy’s early novel, “Far
from the Madding Crowd,” which had lain
forgotten for 40 years in a cupboard of the
publishers, Smith Elder and Co., realised
£230. The memorandum-book in which
Dickens jotted down hints and ideas for
future scenes and characters was knocked
down for £325. It was presented by his self-
surviving son. Judge Henry Feilding Dick-
ens, of the City of London Court. Twenty-
two other Dickens manuscripts aggregated
£560; 20 Stevensons, £460; 10 Merediths.
£128; a couple of Kiplings, £130; a Byron
letter, £65; a Shelley ditto, £81; and a
Charlotte Bronte letter to her publishers
accompanying the MS. of “Jane Eyre,” £BO.
The original MS. of Barrie’s “Little Min-
ister” was run up to 310 guineas.
“Musketqon”; Anyone know of a more
versatile newspaper man than Rowlands, of
the Oanowindra (N.S.W.) Star? He is
editor, proprietor, reporter and lino-operator,
and in his spare time he keeps the books and
helps his “jobbing” hand.' The Star is an
eight-page weekly, and there are worse pro-
ductions.

THE HAPPY EDITOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In five and thirty years, ah me!
A-niany editors I’ve known.
A curious, secret hrood they be,
And quaint the mission is they own;
For like the angel at the gate
Of Paradise they stand, devout,
With visage stern and eye elate,
From papers that they dominate
To bar the very good thing out.
The poet’s deadly enemy
The editor has always been.
Dissecting his sweet poetry
To find some blemish yet unseen,
Some tiny flaw, some tuneless rhyme.
Or may be feet that limping run —
Excuses for his heinous crime,
The damning of the gem of time
To barren, black oblivion.
Young authors wielding flashing pens
The editors behold with hate,
And slyly lure them to their dens,
Their fondest hopes to immolate.
The fair brain-babe of anguisli born
Entice they to the door, and grin
All day to hear the bairn forlorn
In heat or wintry rigor mourn,
And mock and will not let it in.
The happy editor conceive
In cage-like sanctum barred away
Where writers crowd about and grieve,
And mew at him the livelong day.
He works upon their stuff With glee,
Then scatters to the eager rout
His thick, dull journal, printless, see,
Of tale, and par, ahd hrtistvy—
In short, with everything left out 1

MORE POPULAR THAN EVER
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is the finest Cough
Remedy you can buy. It is just as necessary in the home
as in the trenches. New Discovery will banish all colds
from father’s bronchitis down to baby’s croupy cough, so
take two bottles home to-night, one for home use, the other
for your soldier boy. Don’t forget New Discovery. Price,
Is. 6d, and 3s.
Two Sydney Favorites Praise
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
“1 feel It my duty to write
attd tell you how good I have
found your Dr. Sheldon’s
New Discovery.’ To say the
least, I am enthusiastic
about it, for it has cured me
in the most marvellous
fashion of one of the most
troublesome colds I ever
had. Its lightning effects
on a cold are little short of
marvellous, for I felt better
after the first dose, and in
less than three days’ time
u r as absolutely right again.
Since then 1 have used it every time I have felt the slightest indication of a
huskiness in my throat or cold coming on, and I can truthfully say that it has
been effective immediately. I think ‘New Discovery’ by far the best thing I
have ever come across for a cold, and I most heartily recommend it.
“Yours sincerely, “(Sgd.) MAUDE FANE.”
“I sun writing: to tell you
what a strong' advocate I am
of Dr. Sheldon’s ‘New Discov-
ery.’ It is the only thing
that does me any good when
I have a bad cold or cough,
or when my throat feels sore
or strained. During the past
two years I have used it
on numerous occasions, and
always with the best results.
It is an excellent remedy,
and I never feel safe to start
on a trip without having a
bottle of it in my bag.
“With very best wishes
for ‘New Discovery,’

FIRST at THE FRONT & FIRST at HOME
Our brave boys have enough suffering and danger to endure in the trenches without letting them run unnecessary risk of colds, perhaps
ending in serious throat and chest troubles. We all know what boys are, and how neglectful they are if mother is not there to keep them up to
the mark, so protect your boys by sending them a bottle of Dr. Sheldon's New Discovery, the prompt and effective cold-banisher. They will be
delighted at your thoughtfulness, and take it to please you at first, and, finding that it banishes the cold and eases the throat so quickly, later
they will fly to it for relief at the first sign of cold.
All our Soldier boys swear by Dr. Sheldon's New Discovery for Coughs and Colds. See what some of our boys write: —-

“When I left Australia
with the 19th Battalion, sth
Brigade, on June 25, 1915, I
packed in my kit a bottle of
‘New Discovery,’ because I
had been suffering while in
camp from catarrh of the

Edward Sheldon, author of “The Nigger,’
which was lately a feature of Guy Bates
Post’s Melbourne season, was the author of
“Salvation Nell,” which made a hit 10 years
ago. The Bulletin’s notice of the first
night of “The Nigger” in Melbourne said,
“The play was written by a high-minded
nigger of the type that figures in the name-
part.” This was a print error of the word
“by” instead of “Of*” for which' the paper is
sorry. The sentence should, of course, have
read: “The play was written of a high-
minded nigger of the type that figures in the
name-part.” Sheldon, as is well-known, is
a white American. Other pieces from his
pen are “The Boss,” “Princess Zim-Zim.”
Each of these plays were produced within
three years—“ Salvation Nell,” 1908; “The
Nigger,” 1909; “The Boss” and Princess
Zim-Zim,” 1911.
“C.” : “Katinka” at Her Majesty’s (Melb.)
is the nearest approach to the good
old-time comic-opera production since the
days when Leon Caron held the stick.
I was particularly impressed with the
purity of tone in the voice of Gladys
Moncrieff, and I am of the opinion that

as a concert
singer she would
prove more
pleasing than
any “little Mel-
ba” discovery to
date. As an
actress Gladys
fails. She lacks
depth, person-
ality and that
wonderful some-
thing which gets
over the foot-
lights. She has
now had suffici-
ent theatrical
experience t o
have improved beyond the average amateur
standard ; yet she seems incapable of realis-
ing that her “presence” is had, her gestures
ungraceful and that her frocks sag. Still,
I’ll forgive her for her voice.
Oscar Asche has added a couple of new
scenes to his gorgeous Oriental, spectacle
“Chu Chin Chow” at His Majesty’s, Lon-
don. One is entitled “In the Starlight” and
the other is an oasis in the desert. They are
musically illustrated by eight striking songs
and characteristic dances, and have been
•welcomed with favor. Asche’s prediction
that “Chu Chin Chow” will run well into
1919 looks safe.
“8.T.”: It happened at the old Alexandra,
Melbourne, in Alfred Dampier’s time. The
King was Alfred, the full strength of the
family was scattered about the stage, and
the auditorium contained a thin sprinkling
of cold people who looked as if they had
wandered in from the rain, and couldn’t
find their way out again. The dignified cour-
tier approached, went on his knucklebones to
majesty, and said: “Sire, there is one with-
out craves an audience.” Then clearly and
distinctly the good king replied: “Good
G —d! Does the fool expect to find it here?”
“K Flat”: The “Casse Noisette Suite,”
crispest of ballet music, has got musical Syd-
ney by tlie ear, and everyone is much obliged
to Verbrugghen for getting liis N. S. Wales
Conservatorium Orchestra on to it. I have
had the set of records for years, and have
often wondered why one of the theatre
managements has not snapped up the spark-
ling little things. They are full of movement
and imagination. The success of Elsie
Parkes’ solo dances in “Samples” was
largely due to the dainty, well-chosen music
provided. I’d like to see one of our clever
Australian girls (or a group of them) in-
terpret the “Casse Noisette” trifles. Such
music is an inspiration.
Hall Caine has introduced a new theatri-
cal fashion. He no longer lives at Greeta
Castle in the Isle of Man, but has fixed liis
abode at Hampstead, a breezy and beautiful
northern suburb of London, where he has
many literary and artistic neighbors. Play-
wrights are bashful folks as a rule (don’t he
misled by tlieir press agents), and many of
them cannot be prevailed upon to face an
audience even on the first nights of tlieir
successful plays. But Hall Caine does not
suffer from superfluous or embarrassing
modesty of that sort. He has started the
fashion of dropping in promiscuously at the
London Royalty, where his new war play,
“The Prime Minister,” was at last mail-clos-

ing drawing well, and delivering a speech
before the rising of the curtain by way of
introducing the piece to the audience. In
a Saturday night oration the red-headed
little Manxman addressed himself to the
cause of the war, which he said lay deep
down in the education of the German people.
For 40 years they had been taught in their
schools and universities that the German
race was providentially predestined to in-
herit the earth, that war was the means by
which this great good was to be attained,
and therefore they were justified in perpe-
trating any international crimes that seemed
necessary to secure power, expansion and
world supremacy of the Empire. He ener-
getically denounced this view and various
other “damnable doctrines” of the latter-day
Huns.
“De Oriel”: When we took the show into
the Wimmera (Vic.) district lately, I spoke
hotly to Mr. Public House because I found
his premises was minus a bath. He was
apologetic. “You see, sir,” he said, “this
is only a working-man’s hotel.”
“S.T.S.”: “0.K.,” who mentions “Called
Back,” novel and drama (B. 20/6/T8) as
forgotten, known only to “Australians of
older growth,” may care to note that WiR
liam Anderson’s melodrama co. gave the play
a successful run at Adelaide Tivoli last May,
and that The Bulletin gave a fairly long
notice of it, with due remembrance of George
Rignold and Beerbohm Tree in the great
part of Macari.
An odd theatrical discussion has cropped
up in London, as to whether Gilbert, in
originally producing “H.M.S. Pinafore,” em-
phasised the ladylike character of the man-
o’-war’s management by displaying an anti-
macassar on each gun. _ The matter was
referred to Rutland Barrington, who replied
that the idea may have been introduced in
some of the countless productions ot the
40-years-ago success, but that it was not in
the original staging.
“Melb”: “The Man Who Came Back,” at
the Royal, is tlie
boldest defiance of
what the French
critics term “tlie
unities” that I re-
member. Corneille,
Racine and Vol-
taire were ham-
pered by classic
ideas about the
unities of time and
place. Shakspeare
flung them to the
winds. But “The

From London:—
Oscar Asche, it seems, is not quite as tactful and
courteous and considerate to the dramatic critics as
lie might be. On May 15 “Chu Chin Chow,” reached
its 750t1i performance at His Majesty’s, and a
number of fresh features and attractions were intro-
duced. Said the Daily Telegraph : “The cast also
boasts a couple of newcomers, both well equipped
vocally and histrionically for the work assigned
them. But as the present management does not
provide critics with programmes it must accept respon-
sibility for the omission of the names of these artists.
It was otherwise in the days of Tree.” Curious that
Asche should have failed to consult the convenience
of the critics on such an auspicious occasion. Several
of them resented the slight or discourtesy by ignoring
the show altogether—a result that Oscar could
hardly have contemplated. But the Telegraph
sugar-coated its rebuke with a highly complimentary
notice, praising the newly-introduced scenes as “won-
derfully beautiful and picturesque the strikingly
dramatic numbers... .the lovely dresses of which
words fail to give any adequate description. .. .in the
way of spectacle nothing more exquisite could be
imagined.”
“Private Boxer”: Guy Bates Post does
not believe in long intervals between the
acts. Strange that such a sensible idea did
not apparently strike any manager or pro-
ducer before he came. There’s no chance
of going to see a man about a dog when
the act-drop falls these days. The American
reckons that his plays are refreshment
enough.
“ J.F.H.”: W. L. Courtney, poet, play-
wright, editor of the Fortnightly Review
and literary reviewer of the Daily Tele-
graph, recently lectured in London on
Dramatic Realism. He urged playwrights to
deal with “real” persons and “real” situa-
tions. The ordinary romantic hero and
heroine, he explained, were creatures of a
warm-hearted and sympathetic but entirely
false imagination. The happy endings for
which most theatrical audiences craved were
in 90 cases out of a lufndred untrue and arti-
ficial. There was no real reason or necessity
for winding up a play in the “happy ending.”
In real life things did not arrange themselves
into happy situations to provide effective cur-
tains, and it was the business of the stage to
hold the mirror up to nature, or words to
that effect. If the plot demanded a melan-
choly conclusion, then the conclusion should
be a melancholy one. Which is true enough
in the abstract; but there is no getting away
from the hard fact that a play with a gloomy
ending is heavily handicapped as a commer-
cial speculation.
A show programme suddenly broken off to
introduce a prayer is a very unusual event.
If occurred at Bradford (Eng.), the York-
shire city that absorbs large quantities
of Australian wool, in the house where
Henry Irvine fell dead op the stage after
speaking the closing words of Tennyson's
"Becket”: "Into Thy hands, O Lord.’’ Mar-
tin Harvey, one of Irving’s most success
fui young men in concluding a season
at Bradford, made a speech of thanks and
incidentally referring to the latest news from
the battle-front, invited the audience to rise
and pray for a moment or two. vcl ere v
man happened to be in the house and offici-
ated as leader. The crowded audience was
overcome with emotion and left the theatre
as quietly and solemnly as if it. was retir-
ing from a cathedral or a pawnshop.
The first big picture show in Melbourne
was established, not so many years ago at
the Olympia building, which had been’de-
signed for Wirths’ Circus. This was the
original West’s Pictures. In due course a
more solid building was erected for West
and thither the show shifted from the old
pitch. Later Hoyt’s came along and ran
opposition picture-shows at Olympia, and for
the last year or two the West edifice has
been a place of only occasional importance.
Now Hoyt’s, in its turn, is moving from its
old pitch into West’s big brick building, and
is spending a pile of money in re-decorations
and furnishings. Time has touched the pic-
ture business with a lavish hand. The new
West’s will be re-opened by old opponent
Hoyt on July 20.
“Harrison O.” : At last there seems a pros-
pect of Australia seeing plays of literary
distinction interpreted by professional casts.
Encouraged by the reception accorded Dun-
sany’s “A Night at an Inn,” at the recent
Actors’ Association Corroboree, at Sydney
Criterion, Frank Harvey and others are form-
ing a Stage Society, with the idea of giving
Sunday-night performances in Melb. and
Sydney. It is proposed to charge members
of the society a guinea, which will entitle
them to two seats at four performances in
Melbourne and four in Sydney. The plays
staged will be of a kind that the average
commercial management would not produce,
but the J.C.W. firm and the Taits have
offered the free use of their theatres for the
unusual productions. Which is worth
applauding. Gregan McMahon, Melb. Re-
pertory Theatre director, will probably lend
a hand. Already there is talk of presenting
works by Synge, Dunsany, Lady Gregory.
Galsworthy, and even of trying Strindberg’s
“Miss Julie.” One-acters especially are to be
featured, and local dramatists who have any-
thing worth while to offer will be given a
chance.
SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I went a picture play to see,
A drama of Australian make,
And such an awe came over me
I lelt my bulky being quake,
And knew the coldness of the tomb,
For there, in emptiness and gloom,
Before me rose in tableaux fast
The buried past.
I saw tlie actor, tail, austere,
Who in tlie dead years was to be
Tlie foremost in liis special sphere.
lie came from blank obscurity
That had for long years hidden him.
Canst wonder that I found him grim,
Who noiseless stalked time’s mystic sand
In shadowland?
Came yet another, gaunt and grey,
1 recognised with terror, too.
She was quite pretty in her day,
And marvellous things she meant to do.
A little while she lingered, then
She faded from the minds of men.
Now here she shines among a host —
A faded ghost.
Yes, many were there, men who’d gone
And long ago had been forgot,
And women who’s brief day had shone
When I was young (as I am not),
And still the haunted film parades
Pathetic shadows from the shades.
Who’s lie produces this so well—
Not Gabrielf
VICTORIA.

SYD
Y.
By the death of George Peake, at Port
Pirie (S.A.), the bad old times of inter-State
jealousy were recalled. He was the first
officer appointed to take charge of the Cus-
toms at Cockburn in the ’eighties, when the
line from Adelaide to the new town of Broken
Hill made another bordei point to be
watched.
The sculpture' of Caxton and his printing
press which the late Sam Bennett placed
over the old —-then new — Evening News
office in Pitt-slreet, Sydney, has been re-
moved. It was raised about 45 years ago by
“Surly Sam.'' He had his three sons, Alfred.
Frank and Christopher, engaged with him in
the business. All are now dead.
"Dug-out” : I know of one instance where
the G.P.O. showed signs of intelligence. A
letter posted at Sydney by a departing
sailor, addressed in semaphore signals to my
Braidwood (N.S.W.) home, was translated
and delivered the next day in good order and
condition. Perhaps working out these
puzzles is the cause of delay in ordinary
business.
An international siren lately arrested in
America for doing Germany’s dirty work got
her start in life when her father sold her to
a Turk for £6OO, delivered f.o.b. Scutari.
Last week, in Sydney, Maurice Collins, a
South Aus. woolgrower paid the record price
of 3000 guineas for Prince Charley, a ram
bred in N. S. Wales at the Bundcmar stud.
There is a moral in this somewhere.
The new Millbrook (S.A.) reservoir, the
construction of which removed an en-
tire township, was opened last week.
That is, the Torrens was allowed to
begin running into it, through a tunnel a
mile long. It has taken nearly live years to
complete the reservoir, which lias a 700 ft.
(lam, will hold an extreme depth of 87ft., and
is supposed to just about double the former
reserve for the Adelaide plain.
“0.L.”: At the time when the burst-up
happened between the Victorian friendly
societies'and their doctors the accouchement
fee charged to lodge patients had swelled
until it cast its shadow right across the
whole £5 baby bonus. The medical-institute
doctors now have the fee down again to
fc’2 25., which leaves a bit for getting a nurse
in and buying a few oysters for mother.
But the greedy B.M.A. still hankers after
those oysters.
“Machine Gun Corps”: “The Old Soldier”
(B. 4/7/’18) misses the target when lie
refers to Monasli as being the first civilian
to rise to the rank of Lieut-General during
this w r ar. He has overlooked Sir Arthur
Currie, who was a year ago given command
of the Canadian Corps and promoted Lieut.-
Goneral. Currie was an estate-agent in
Victoria, 8.C., when war broke out and
crossed to France with the original Cana-
dians as lieut.-colonel.
The Hun is the ideal tax-gatherer. He
has collected a regular monthly contribution
towards the cost of its own destruction from
Belgium ever since the beginning of the
war. Now he has put it up to £2,400,000
per month or £288,000,000 a year, equal on
the remnant of population to £BO or £lOO
annually per head. Of course only a frac-
tion of it can be paid, but the country owes
the balance, and there are ways of “taking
it out of the hide” of the defaulter.
“Solomon Malaprop’s” suggestion:—
Why not have a Stop-the-Drought party as well
as a Stop-the-War party? The same party would
<lO. The undertakings seem equally impossible, but
nothing is lost by trying. Drought is more numer-
ous than war. Wo can do our share to keep the
war in Flanders and Palestine, so that we escape
all the worst effects, but we can’t send the drought
to Flanders or Palestine. It is right here and we
get all the bad effects. On the other hand, being
here, it is handy for attack, and the business will
arouse no international complications unless we steal
other people’s rain, which isn’t likely. The first
essential is to secure the services of Judd. I don’t
know what the next step would be. but Judd is
indispensable.
“Edo”: Last week Judge Booth, of
Westralia, decided that it was illegal for
members of an industrial union to use its
funds to help the wives, and children of men
out on strike. Ilis Honor also jumped on
unions for handing out strike ammunition
under cloak of helping to relieve a kindred
association’s financial strain. The case
was brought against Ivalgoorlie and Boulder
Miners’ Union officials by members who
objected to their money going to assist
strikers at Fremantle and in N. S. Wales.
Regarding Fremantle, some lumpers asked
for assistance to pay legal expenses incurred
months before, and they asked at a time
when they were refusing to handle cargoes.
The circumstances were clearly suspicious,
and there was judgment for the plaintiffs.
Something that The Bulletin has been
awaiting for a long time arrived last week—
the announcement that the “gold-producing
interests” were busy representing to the
British Government the great justice of in-
creasing the price of gold, and the contro-
versy is sooner or later going to rage with
great violence, partly because of the enor-
mously increased cost of acquiring an article
of fixed value and mainly because of the
stupendous debts that are being bfiilt up. A
change in the price of gold would, of course,
be something in the nature of an economic
earthquake. Heaven only knows what the
immediate profit would be to holders of gold,
but it is fairly certain that a country heavily
in debt like Australia would find itself think-
ing harder than ever about dead horses.
“Demos”: A Gent One. trustee of a
deceased Tasmanian’s estate, turned up at
court the other day and inquired whether
wattle-bark was a timber or a crop? The
object of the question was to ascertain
whether the life-tenant on the property in*
question was entitled to receive the proceeds
of the wattle-bark gathered on it. If it was
a crop the tenant did collect, but if it was
a timber she had to share the proceeds with
other beneficiaries under the will. Counsel
argued that, as the wattle-tree died when its
hide was removed, the bark could hardly be
regarded as a crop but should be classed as
a timber. The Judge reckoned the question
wag too much for him to decide, so he passed
it on to the Full Court. If the wattle-bark
is declared to be a timber the tenant cockies
of the State will lose a big item of income.

“ G.8.D.”!
A scwt. bell bought from a ■ second-hand
dealer at Norwood, an Adelaide suburb, for
an Anglican Church was found to bear the
inscription, “City of Melbourne.” It turns
out to have been the original fire-bell used by
the City Volunteer Brigade, and was sold
recently by the Metropolitan Brigade.
Percival Brookfield, of Broken Ilill, in
N. S. Wales Assembly, on recruiting:— r
My most treasured possession is the knowledge
that no man ever went away through any word of
mine, and as long as I live no word of mine shall
encourage any man to go to the war.
This seems fairly definite evidence about the
struggles of Brookfield to assist Labor in
making the voluntary system a success, but
it is not quite full enough. Can Brookfield
take the Book in his right hand and say:—
My most treasured possession is the knowledge that
no man ever refused to go away through any .word of
mine, and as long as 1 live no word of mine shall
encourage any man to leave his mate in the ditch?
And if he objects to saying this what sort
of a decoration does he think he ought to
get?
The politician's pathetic inability to realise
that the old order is passing and that the
old dodge is worn out turns up everywhere.
Thus a deputation waited recently on Minis-
ter Ball to ask for another tram-line in the
much-trammed metropolis of Sydney, and
suggested providing the means by the sale of
a hunk of public land at French’s Forest.
Minister Ball promised to muse over the
scheme.. Even if the Government sold the
Blue Mountains and the Old Man Plain it
is difficult to see that it could get much for
them just now except paper money. The
country can’t purchase tramway material
with paper except when the goods are
made in the country, and for some stupid
reason connected with the Foreign-trade
faith and the importing interest they
aren’t made in the country. The fine
old days when we could buy plenty of
goods abroad by selling bits of .land to each
other have become tarnished. The gilt has
gone off the gingerbread.
“Dial Sight,” after an inspection:—
The new regulation in England (R. 13/6/’18),
which places a lady who distributes venereal dis-
ease under medical supervision after discovery that
she is infected, only partly meets the trouble. In
France there is regular inspection of prostitutes,
and out of one bunch of the overhauled three, to my
knowledge, were interned. Now, how much damage
had they done, in the meantime? If Flossie was con-
fined to a regular beat in London or any other
accommodating city it might be possible to do some-
thing useful by the aforesaid regulation, but London
(say) is a bit bigger than Korumburra, and Flossie
doesn’t, belong to one class. The war will be over
long before the regulation protects a single Billjim,
However, much good has been done by setting up
the “early treatment” depSt at Horseferry-road,
London. It is open 24 hours a day and asks no
questions. Questions are the curse of a man’s life.
Recently :i meeting of women was
called at Sydney Trades Hall to demand
a living wage. Well, if the beauti-
ful and indispensable sex lived on things
made in Australia, the prices of which we
can regulate, then she could certainly have
a living wage. But—-partly by reason of her
vote, for she has been a pretty consistent
Freetrader —we depend on a thousand things
the prices of which are beyond our control.
And with the best will in the world it is
impossible to say that woman or anybody
else can have a living wage a few months
hence. By next year she may not have more
than a burial wage, but she can always have
that for, thank Heaven, we don’t import
funerals. All that can be promised, even to
the most attractive maid or wife or widow,
is that, in the final resort, she can have the
whole net value of everything she produces,
less her share of the cost of government—
some kind of government being, necessary,
else big, coarse men would tear her products
and her wages from her in the street: and plus
her proportion of anything the country can
borrow abroad. If the operator abroad hap-
pens to put up the cost of living beyond
that limit, then woman will have to peg out
or else eat the lady next door. It is regret-
table, and it is very brutal, but it is Free-
trade, especially in war-time.
“Flaps”: “F.E.11.” says (B. 27/6/T8)
that Donald A. Swanson’s scheme for reliev-
ing the congestion of Greater Melbourne is
the most practical so far suggested. Perhaps
it is. but in another decade the trouble
would be as bad as ever. The Central
station is on the wrong side of the Yarra,
and being jambed between the river and the
edge of the city has no room to expand. My
idea is that the terminus for all trains now
using Flinders-street or Princes Bridge
stations as such, should be somewhere over
about the Domain. This would do away
with the viaduct altogether; the north
suburban trains which use it at present
would cross the river about Spencer-street
and not interfere much more with the ship-
ping than Swanson’s scheme. The other
part of the northern railway service would
cross the river up about the Treasury Gar-
dens, and probably then go underground for
a good distance. At present all south
suburban trains have to cross the river
somewhere. There is plenty of ground avail-
able to build my new Central station, but
I’m doubtful about the money. Has any-
one got any small change?
“Signals”: A Bulletin correspondent
has stated that the shell that hits a man
in its flight is never heard by the unfortu-
nate recipient. This may be quite correct
when the gun is fired at close range, as the
velocity of the shell in its early flight is
much greater than that of sound; but on
the other hand, when the weapon is fired at
its extreme range, the velocity of the shell
is so reduced in the last of its flight that
the sound produced overtakes the shell itself
and can be distinctly heard before the little
keepsake arrives: I happened to be one
of a party that received particular attention
from “.Jaeko” in the valley of the Jordan,
near Jqricho. Jacko sent us over a salvo
of 5.9 in. h.e. shells mixed with a few shrap-
nels. At a distance of six miles ( according
to my estimate) we could distinctly hear the
report of the gun several seconds before the
shell arrived. Further, we could hear the
increasing shriek of the projectile before the
explosion took place, in some cases 10 to 20
yards in front of us. This fact is probably
partly due to the trajectory of the shell in
its flight.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, July 15, 1918.
My Dear Arini, —
Sydney be-flagged itself for France on
July 14. The meeting in the Town Hall
to waft. our thanks to our heroic Ally
brought a huge audience. The Galleries
were lined with Billjim, off to the war,
with his kit slung over his shoulder. Mayor
Joynton Smith was in his official seat be-
hind the platform table. His Ex., apparently
in the throes of the worst cold he could
acquire, passed a bouquet to the land of
Foch. The French-Australian League was
represented by the president, Mrs. Playoust
a melancholy figure in deep mourning for
the recent death in action of a gallant son—-
and her devoted helpers, Miss Gurnev and
Mrs. Jewett. The Segurs, the Acting’' Con-
sul-General for France, M. Paul, a big
political contingent from Maequarie-street,
Dr. Fiasclu, with his wife and a small tod-
dling Fiaschi, Consul Marario, State Com-
mandant George Lee (with Colonel Lamrock
at his elbow), and Dr. Mary Booth, were in
the throng. Premier Holman paid a brilli-
ant tribute to the spirit of France.
The Davidson lady recently rounded up a
meeting which seethed with youth and enthu-
siasm, to inaugurate the State Junior Red
Cross. Recently, in a country tour, the
Davidsons struck the indomitable Australian
kiddie on the edge of Sunset. A mountain of
socks for the War Chest was one school-
marm’s proud exhibit. His Ex. diplomati-
cally expressed his appreciation—financially,
the youngsters scorned the lure of turning
the appreciation into chocolates, and de-
manded that wool should be bought. “After
such an incident,’’ murmured the sub-regal
lady. “I felt that the Australian child
deserved official recognition as a patriotic
body. The veteran in the Junior Red Cross
will be 18 years of age.
The National Economy Exhibition pro-
gresses favorably in the Women’s Association
rooms, top floor, 313 George-street. Hon
sec. Ruth Beale finds time from her duties as
an important personage before the Inter-
state Commission, to lead the visitor gently
lound the exhibits. These are chiefly samples
ol Australia s undoubted ability to support
herseit it the political sinners would
give her a chance. Ruth is the
capable lady whose message to women
is Standardise dress! No flummery
in war-time!” The challenge is causing cold
slavers to run down the spine of local society.
There s certainly one small bone to be picked
with her re “thrift in dress.” Ruth says that
, ) summer nothing is nicer or cheaper than
} vh , lte - Well, as the laundry lady col-
lects _s. 6d. every time she “does up” a white
frock, and the average boarding-house strictly
prohibits washing” in the bath, and as one
wipe-up of a dirty city tram-seat turns a
linen frock into a drab duster, there’s
nothing uproariously cheap about white. As
a matter of fact, economy drives business
women-into dark muslins.

The Westgarths have been limbs of the
law-tree in Sydney for the past two genera-
tions. When the war came, Mervyn, a son
of the late solicitor George Westgarth, joined
the Light Horse. His end in Palestine,
after'fine service for his country, is a recent
memory. In consequence his sister Doreen
had a quiet wedding when Gerald Rains-
ford produced the ring in old St. Philip's
Church (the edifice that was named after
Australia’s first Governor) recently. Brides-
maid Helen Moore attended to the leading
lady’s finery (a fluff of silk and gossamer
lace) and straightened the long court train.
With Mrs. Guy Bates Post, as accompa-
nist* and friend, is Miss Woolworth, a sound
musician who hails from Melbourne. She’s
a youthful widow, but sticks to her maiden
name in the profesh. Mrs. Post, the golden-
haired charmer, who is Adele Ritchie on the
programme, keeps up her vocal gymnastics.
She sings in light opera when she’s in U.S.A.
Major E. G. Manchester, of the 2nd Aus-
tralian S’iege Battery, writing to relatives
in Sydney, relates that, after one big scrap
(in France) he went to see a theatrical
troup of Australians. “They call them-
selves ‘The Sentimental Blokes,’ and give
a good show. The ‘girl’ is a South Aus-
tralian soldier. He has a voice one cannot
tell from the feminine organ, and sings
splendidly.”
At a meeting to push the concert for the
Hospice (Aug. 15 is the date) Mayor Joyn-
ton Smith was in tire chair and kept the
business from loitering, after he had bustled
the committee into a preliminary conver-
sazione, and that was done before the guests
could arrange their veils or. undo their furs.
Pianist Beatrice Griffiths (Mrs. Walter
G. Swinsou) has a fund of lively anecdotes.
Here is one of the Australian musician’s
first recollections of London. When a
young and very green arrival, she and her.
two still younger sisters were taken by their
mother to be photographed. They had dis-
covered an Australian photographer in, as
they thought, Park-lane. The camera man
made an appointment, and the party
rumbled up to a splendid door in an old
four-wheeler of that date. They were solemnly
bowed into the hall, where three magnificent
beings in crimson and silver livery—known to
the hilarious as “calves”- —bowed in unison.
Nothing surprises Jeames, and silently he
and his brothers observed the Australian
Trio dump down suit-cases. “Hasn’t Mr.
So-and-so got a nice place!” said one of the
girls. “Will you kindly show us to a room
to. change our things?” (This to the head or
principal Jeames.) “We have an appoint-
ment with the photographer here at 2
o’clock.” Then a shocked Jeames replied:
“I think, Madam, you have made a mistake.
This is the town house of his Royal Highness
the Duke of Cambridge.” When Beatrice
hurriedly looked again at the letter in her
pocket (they had pockets in skirts in those.
days) she saw that the right address was
1 Parkside. The cannibals left; but Yellow
Plush is at the old address.
“It is a beautiful
day, and I’m going
out sketching. All’s
well with the
world !” This is a
typical get-away of
M. J. MacNally,
water-colorist, whose
genial face beams
through rose-tinted
specs. (You can’t
see the rose-tint, but
it's there.) Even
the war, for which
disturbance he is in-
eligible (Mac is more
than 20) cannot
down his optimism.
MacNally is a
widely-travelled man,
and knows student
life in Paris, the club-rooms of London, the
butter market of Denmark, and the big art
centres in New York. But he always comes
home to Australia. No place like it, he
says. Its sunshine is in his blood, and he
drafts the sun-gleams on to his sketch block
as if he and they were eternal mates.
Years ago MacNally studied at the Mel-
bourne National Gallery under Fred McCub-
bin and John Mather. Later, he joined the
famous Herkomer Art School at Bushey
Park (Eng.). However, he regarded his
brush as a hobby, and made his bread and
cheddar in “business.” A very surprised
MacNally suddenly discovered that quite a
lot of people wanted to buy his pictures. His
sunlit hilltops and winding country roads
had found a market. It was some time
before he could persuade himself to give up
commerce and refrain from giving, away
samples of his hobby to his friends. To-day
he is not only one of the best-liked artists in
Australia, but he is rapidly becoming one of
the best-sellers. Geelong, which has a good
gallery, bought_ one of his ambitious can-
vases. Over £5OO has come his way, as a
welcome to his brush, within an incredibly
short time. “All’s well with the world.”

Mrs. Willie Dunlop, of Sydney, arrived in
England some weeks ago without having to
test her lifebelt. She’s over there to be
near her husband, who is in khaki.
The Junoesque Zara Wolinski —artist Joe
is her devoted brother, and father is a Rabbi
of the faith in Sydney—has taken the pro-
fessional name of Loraine West. She’s
singing in the music-halls in England, with
success, so one gathers from the fact that
Arthur Stroud’s song, “That was the End
of My Dream,” has burst into a new edition
with Zara’s comely picture on the cover.
The news that Marjorie, the 15-year-old
daughter of Albert Dorrington, recently
won the bronze star given by the Royal
Drawing Society (London) is not surpris-
ing. Her daddy had artistic instincts and
before handling a pen was a craftsman in
silver-plated goods. His stories in earlier
days pleased Bulletin readers.
Squadron - Com-
mander Roderick E.
Dallas, formerly of
Bananaland, has an-
swered the Great
Call after three years
of gallant service on
different Fronts. As
a schoolboy young
Dallas was very
keen about aerial
science. While other
boys bought marbles
or sweets, he in-
vested in books of in-
formation on his pet
hobby. By way of
experimenting with
the real thing he
built several small
working models. He
was a tireless student and gave up an assay-
ing billet at Mount Morgan to work as a
manual laborer on a lonely island off the
Queensland coast. All the time he kept in
touch with the doings of the world’s leading
airmen. His chance came with the war.
He paid his passage to England and won his
place in the Royal Flying Corps. The
D.S.C. soon came his way, and to this
decoration was added two bars,. He was one
of the first three airmen in the British ser-
vice to win the Croix de Guerre. He
downed at least 34 German machines before
he passed off the currents at 28 on June 1.
Queensland claims him as the State’s best
aviator.
From Brisbane:—
Sgt. Victor Cross, M.M., who entered for the
Nationalist stakes at the last election but was
scratched before the event, was married last-
Saturday to Miss Lily West. Including the bride-
groom, four Military Medallists sat down to the
breakfast. The ’groom’s sister is poetess Zora Cross.
Another hitching which took place on Monday
bound Stewart Dick, of the Daily Standard, for-
-merly of the Melb. Herald, to Clarice Rankin, a
Gympie girl.
The Holmans arrived here on Saturday. Mrs.
Holman and daughter are going up to Cairns.
The Orchid ’ is blooming at His Majesty’s this
week. The Brisbane Amateur Operatic Society is
running the show, which is the best-dressed and
brightest amateur turn-out yet staged here.
Dr. Lilian Cooper and Miss Bedford gave a lecture
to-night on “Hospital and Transport Experiences on
the Bulgarian Front.” Dr. Cooper was with the
Scottish Women’s Hospital in Servia, and Miss Bed-
ford drove a motor-ambulance in the fire zone, dug
the vehicle out when it stuck in the mud, mended it
when it broke down, and in between whiles washed,
fumigated and patched the clothes of her broken
and battered passengers.
Word drops in of the wedding of the late
Samuel Hordern’s eldest daughter, Jane, to
Colonel David Hill, D. 5.0., Deputy-Director
of Ordnance in the British East African Ex-
Natai° nary Force ’ The knot was tied at
T. E. Donne, who so often came this wav
when he was director of Maorilands’ Tourist
Department, and who has fastened to a comfy
billet in London for the benefit of M L., has
two sons One of them, Dr. Donne, has
)C ? n appointed house-surgeon to a
' hosDital. The other is serving
with the Tanks in France.
Adeline Duchess of Bedford, spent some
time iu Australia as the guest of the Dud-
leys. Sydney remembers her as a benign,
homely lady who was chiefly interested in
the better housing of the poor, and the eco-
nomics or home Jife in a three-roomed cot-
tage and all that sort of thing. A warm
and kindly woman. Amongst other worries
she has on her sturdy shoulders the chair-
womanship of the London committee of the
Imperial I risoners of War Welcome Associ-
ation. It is one of her dearest troubles to
be amongst the first to greet the repatriated

A Sydney man, Lieut. Philip Caro, who
went away with Professor David’s lot. to
tunnel under Goliath’s outsize in military
boots, is now “chief messing officer” for the
Australians in England. He has been
wounded twice and once he had a narrow
escape of losing his eyesight. Caro, who is
a,clever engineer, turns his mechanical skill
to solid use in the rationing department" He
has produced a machine which turns oiu
margarine at the rate of a ton every seven
minutes.
Jack Ernest Peacock, one of a well-
known Hobart family, has answered the
last summons. He was killed in action in
France on June 23, in his 23rd year. There
is a near relative in Sydney—Miss Peacock
of the Roycroft Library.
Bexley V.A.D. had an evening out in the
Conservatorium to push after money for
the Rose Hall motor. Returned wounded in
the convalescent stage need the outings that
a petrol chaise provides. Besides our own
men invalided Maorilanders and others are
welcomed to the haven. There was a big
house on Saturday night. Two McLean
girls, Jessie in recitation and Fannie in
song, the delicate pianist, Lauranee Philip
Henri Staell behind the fiddle, and Lilian
Frost as hon. accompanist, were in the list
of performers.
In the King’s Hall on Saturday evening.
July 27, there’s to be a bright show to help
the A.S.C. Christmas Comforts Fund. Ella
Goodman, whose tuneful soprano is being
nicely polished by Mrs. Hugh Ward, and
Ellis Price are chiefly responsible. Ella is
the youthful daughter of Sydney’s old
friend “Goody,” for ever so many years a
faithful watchdog of the J.C.W. interests "m
front.”
Last week’s orchestral concert in the Con-
servatorium drew a big house. Verbrug-
ghen’s “conducting” and the trucking of Mrs.
Goossens were features. The lady has the
correct instinct for putting a dab or two of
black velvet, on the right spot. Her gown was
a heavenly blue.
Another hop. On July 27. in Sargents’
Rooms, Market-street, younger members of
the Australian Flying Corps Comforts Fund
am going to chase the glowing hours with
white-satin slippers. Money is wanted for
our birdmen’s parcels.
News comes by cable of Sister Moodie
Ileddle, formerly matron of the Epileptic
colony near Melbourne. She had gone to
Canada on a visit to a brother in that snow-
clad Dominion, got a chill, and then pneu-
monia ended a fine life in a few days.
Another brother is the handsome skipper of
the Katoomba. They’re from Orkney, the
place where big 1 sailor-men come from.
Mrs. Baverstock, after a long pursuit
along Inky Way. retires from active jour-
nalism. at the end of the month. Presswomen
are going to God-speed her at the Australia
early in August. After that the pen ladv
packs rip for Jervis Bay, where Mr. B. has
a shore billet. He used to go down to the
sea in ships and other vessels. Mrs. Baver-
stock has frequently dug a good pen into The
Bulletin.
Blamire Young, hitherto the artist of
Arcady, is bringing the .war home to his once
peaceful sheep-wolds. His recent show of
water-colors in London included a picture
that caught the public fancy. The title. “The
(shepherd Hears the /Guns at Dawn,’ is sug-
gestive of an unusual piece of-work.
Minister Beeby’s sister Lucv, after over
three years’ service as a Nightingale, is home

There’s a sorrowing Sydney mother in
mourning for two soils in the A.I.F. Both
boys won the Military Cross. Captain

This must appeal to YOU.
A Letter from a musical resident of Sydney
who has since exchanged - his player for a
Duo-Concerto.
Dear Sir, —
After trying a Duo-Concerto I simply want one,
and would be glad to "know what allowance you will make
on my present player. I thought I had one of the best
procurable until I tried a Duo-Concerto. I then thought
the difference was in the two rolls I tried on it, but on
purchasing and trying them on my instrument the result
was puzzling and disappointing. I now realise the
significance of your advertisement, staling that it is the
player “with a soul.” A trial has convinced me that one
can play the piano with the Duo-Concerto, but not with
the ordinary player action. I may add that it was an
accidental trial of one that made me so dissatisfied with
my instrument that 1 determined to take this course.
We will also convert your own Upright or Grand Piano into
a$ up-to-date 88-note Player Piano by inserting this wonderful
MECHANISM
without mutilating the case or in any way interfering with the
ordinary hand-playing of the instrument. W e will give you a
written guarantee with every installation, also a list of our ,

IF BILIOUS OR CONSTIPATED TAKE
CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Harmless fruit laxative cleanses
stomach, liver and bowels
without griping or
discomfort.
An acid stomach, clogged with fermenting,
ill-digested food, means that the liver is not
doing its duty. Nature provided ripe fruit
juices to keep the liver up to its work.
California Syrup of Figs—“Califig”—is a
deliciously refreshing fruit laxative which is
always in season. You can keep it at hand,
and it will be an unfailing friend whenever
the tongue is coated, bowels sluggish, breath
foul, throat dry or sore, stomach full of
wind, and head hot and aching. You can
take a dose whenever it is needed, as safely
as you could eat fresh fruit. In a short
while you will feel the benefit. The bowels
will be gently relieved, and the stomach
cleansed and sweetened as the undigested
food is moved on and got rid of. The tongue
will grow clean again and the head will be
cooled and cleared. There is no mistaking
the beneficial effects of California Syrup of
Figs—“Califig.” Directions are with it for
adults and children of all ages. This
pleasant laxative is good for all, and cannot
possibly harm even the most delicate, but
you must ask for “Califig”—California
Syrup of Figs, and look for the name and
trade-mark of the California Fig Syrup Co.
All chemists sell “Califig”—California
Syrup of Figs—in bottles of two sizes,
1/1* and 1/9. II

Melbourne, July 15, 1918.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Thfe State Parliament started the o’d
tamihar gas-engine last week. The opening
was a rain-soaked ceremony, and Governor
Stanley was met by a guard-of-honor that
had been kept out in the sleety rain and icv
wind. Inside, Lady Stanley listened in black
satin cheered with pink roses and furs.
1 resident John Davies and his lady had .lie
usual tea-party, and the few guests who met
™£hoJ: UP h r d i a 9L uie ? chatty time round the
laaiators. R ac *y Davies wore a scarf of real
old lace over her black gown. The Loid and
Lady Mayoress were on hand, and, bride-
gioom leppema was there with his bride
i,m e L Gai A n - Cn rat )- The Peacock lady
and Mns Aja ? W ynne also faced the storm;
and d M, R J r n Ma m fo ir d ’ ?? rs - Arthur Robinson
and Mis. Donald Mackinnon. Mrs. Frank
Clarke brought Mrs. Maguire, an Eng’ish
thankf', 11 H lB J n , his speecli referred
i to thc . Plentiful and beneficial
ams, and a shudder went round the
shivery House while the said rains roared
and lashed the roof of the .Exhibition barn.
sVirMvin,P r a IKI National Steeplechase i on
‘?PpL ' y d -' ew a ll, R' e crowd, the trains
;V™ 1 Ca i ,rying a thousand more racegoers
than last year. It was Antarctic weather,
too but icy rain-squalls could not keep the
rv w ,? men .. a^ ay : Tll ey arrived in short
OUlor-mades, little hats and muffling furs.
As usual the Governor’s box was given over
to returned soldiers and sailors. Tliev were
beamingly happy at being on old Fleming-
ton again. Surgeon-General Williams came
out in battered khaki with one of the Cum-
mings. Captain Booth wore tartan trousers
wi i a broad scarlet stripe. Commanders
L cakes and Maguire, visiting from North
bea regions, _ were in the paddock. Mrs.
Maguire arrived in dark brown cloth and
i aik furs, Mrs. L. K. S. Mackinnon in
reai seal and daughter Margot in mole furs.
-Uie Bajah beamed over the win of his dark
horse, Lord Nagar. The Pa nee was snug in
close-fitting navy blue, as usual. Mrs. Frank
Clarkes three-cornered hat deflected all the
winds that blew. Pauline Curran wore
white cloth and a big velvet scarf. General
Hughes brought his daughter, who was in
neat short-checked tailorings. Betty O’Hara
was wrapped in a pale wolf-skin. Mrs.
btuart Brunton looked smart in be-furred
white cloth, and brought, a pretty flapper
daughter in blue. The Tom Hogans lunched
Alin lei Starr during the half-hour she was
away from the birdcage. Mrs. Lempriere
had _ her tailored suit vested in masculine
fashion. Melba did not appear. Airs
Leonard Higgs showed glimpses of a gold-
banded white frock beneath her furs. Phyllis
Reynolds, just back from V.A.D.-ing abroad,
wore black cloth of a cute Bond-street cut.
Mrs. Lindsay Inglis put in an appearance
after a long spell of illness.
The Leslie Stuart dance was the hop of
the winter. The Stuarts gave the party
and their Toorak house and let Tettie
Appleton run the show at a guinea a head
to provide a Christmas dinner for the
Second Brigade. A returned Second Bri-
gadier, Geoffrey Strachan, helped Miss
Appleton and a bevy of girls whose best
young men are fighting with the Second. It
was a brilliant show, and the girls’ partners
were nearly all in uniform. Captain Conant
was there, and Captain Booth, the holiday-
ing genthelp from Tasmania, wore the dark
blue togs (much starred) of his English
regiment. He has brought a limp from the
war. Gordon Melver, on furlough, re-
joiced at finding old-time girl partners. Sandy
Jackson, happy and hearty in spite of one
foot, missing, made money for the cause by
renting a cosy room (with a wood fire and
refreshments) to sitters-out at a guinea a
dance. Couples invaded it by fours just
for the joy of yarning to Sandy. Mrs.
Stuart had spent days (and hubby’s temper)
turning bedrooms into drawing-rooms. Every
fire in the big house was alight and every
hearth had deep, cosy chairs for sitters-out.
“No pneumonia garden-strolls,” was the
ultimatum. Settled card fiends had bridge
tables set round other cosy fires. The ball-
room was packed with lovely girls whirling
with their soldier-partners, many of whom
wore the Anzac A.
Tettie Appleton wore black with the
Brigade colors (scarlet and blue) slashed
from shoulder to waist. Mrs. Stuart wore
black with diamonds in her hair and the
smile of a satisfied hostess. Two baby
Stuarts, in blue and pink, made £8
selling programmes before their bedtime.
Flight-Major Harrison, brought his pretty
wife clad in peacock greens and blues.
Nurse Argyle, who put aside her linen collar
of office for two hours frivolity, wore a lovely
empire frock. Dr. O’Hara came with all
the daughters he could muster. Mrs. New-
b'gan wore a goM-and-black gown. Miss
“Tatts” Curran showed off Nile green and
gold. Squatter Inglis brought his women-
kind and Mrs. Stewart Brunton.
Madame Melba is already talking of
another trip abroad. Dame Trot.
Bigjohn Forrest is off to, London with his
energetic wife to take his seat in the House
of Lords. Adopted daughter Muriel North
goes along with them.
Charles Emmerton, solid'or partner in
Smith and Emmerton, died of heart trouble
last Wednesday. He was a brother of the
very popular Harry Emmerton, and 73 at the
finish.
Estelle Watson Cooper is trembling on the
br.nk of giving another theatrical entertain-
ment in Sydney. Estelle spends an awful lot
of money on her shows, and then the wretched
critics go and write as if the entertainments
had been put on for tuppence.
Bruce Pearce, Betty Patterson’s smiling
young man, has just gone off to the war on
Comforts Fund bus ness.
The Mayor of Ballarat has invited Mel-
bourne councillors and their wives to a tree-
plan‘ing ceremony and a luncheon party on
Saturday, July 20. There will be quite an
invasion by motor and by train.
Captain Conant had roped in a bunch of
amateurs to give three short plays for the
war funds. Also, Surgeon O’Hara was to be
dug out of his retirement, and pretty daugh-
ter Nan, Mrs. Russell Clarke, Howard Tay-
lor and a Foster (Tasmania) girl were also
to have' helped. But Unforeseen Circum-
stances ard Influenza joined the eo.. so the
performance has been shelved for the pre-
sent.
Mrs. P. ,T. Falconer has arrived from Hong
Kong. Years ago she was Dora Kent, the
pretty daughter of the late Railway Commis-
sioner Kent, and an amateur actress who
created a mild furore as Carmenita in a
successful amateur performance of “The
Runaway Girl.”
Mrs. Anderson, wife of “Max,” of the
Orient shipping co. in S.A., has just passed
through Melbourne on her way to Sydney,
where she will stay with sister Mrs. Payne,
who is looking for a flat in which to 'rest
from housekeeping.
Captain Booth. A.D.C., to Governor New-
degate, is in Melbourne on holiday.
Dr. and Mrs. Jack Spring, of Fitzroy,
being good Americans, had the party of
their lives on ,the Glorious Fourth. Maggie
McCann sang, Claude Hall recited and sang
and a real live eagle looked very wild in a
cage draped with two star-spangled banners.
A miniature Liberty stood among the table
decorations, and the charming hostess wore
a transparent blue frock draped over flesh
pink silk.
Mrs. Carse lately went over to Sydney to
spend a week or so with squatter son Jack
while he was in town with the other sheep-
men. She has had a sad time lately in Mel-
bourne mothering son Frank’s baby. Frank
was killed in France.
Captain “Paddy” Kell of the ill-fated
Wimmera was a jolly chap who fitted his
“shore” clothes well, and was sought
after socially. He often cheered Hobart in
the far-back days when warships lounged
in port for races and regattas.
The widow Loubet (Dr. Kent Hughes’s
doctor daughter) is in residence at the
Women’s Hospital with the Loubet baby.
Melba visited the Alliance Frangaise on
Wednesday night, and found it crowded to
the doors. The Hennessy lady presided in a
cosy ermine coat, and Melba’s big crimson
and fur wrap glowed alongside. Peggy
Centre trilled in mauve and sunset-pink, and
there were two French playlets at which
everybody laughed, I suppose because they
were plainly labelled as comedies.
Melba has a new car —a “drawing-room”
limousine of dull black enamel with crystal
door-lamps, shaped like hour-glasses. The
owner wears a deep crimson-tailored carriage
coat to set it off.
Major Don Bennett, one of our most popu-
lar young bachelor doctors, has returned with
the Anzac A on his arm and has gone up to
the Wimmera to see his people. He hopes to
be back in France in a few months.
Norman Lane, who used to help his dad
tailor Melbourne’s most-expensive dames
before he gave up the scissors for the
bayonet, has left England for the fields of
France.
Jimmy Borrowman has gone on his fourth
transport trip since he lost his arm on active
service. He went away originally with Cap-
tain Carmichael and his first thousand. Chas.
Crespin and Harry Griffiths, both much bat-
tered veterans, went with the same lot.
Hugh V. McKay is getting ready to part as
cheerfully as possible with son Cecil, a fine
youngster just approaching the' military agA
Cecil is bent on flying for his country as
soon as his next birthday is past. Hugh
McKay lost his eldest son early in the war.
Amongst the visitors who have been forced
into a chronic state of goloshes by the
weather is little Captain “Sanay” Jaques,
the popular Sydney barrister, just back from
the Front. Sandy is staying at the Leslie
Stuart house. ILs sp.rit and wit are un-
quenchable, and he bears w.tli a debonair
manner the bad knocking about he got in the
field.
_ The last Hun offensive stopped Major
Gordon Chirnside’s contemplated furlough in
Australia, much to the disgust of fiancee
Mavis Thiel and the maternal Hodges dame.
She is mourning stepson Norman.
Sister Deacon (the Tasmanian heroine
who got a M.M. for sticking to her job in a
hailstorm of shrapnel) is getting back to the
Front. On Thursday afternoon the red-
capcd Nurses’ Club committee, led by the
professorial Allen dame and the two girls,
hostessed a farewell tea-and-bun party in the
Club parlor.
Lieut.-Colonel Francis Heritage, just back
from the wars, is one of five fighting
brothers. He is an extraordinary “double”
to Lieut.-Colonel Syd Sands, of Sydneyside,
and Sands has shaved off the small military
moustache, such as Heritage wears, for iden-
tity’s sake. The two are close pals and
were both promoted to their present rank
on the same day.
Major Harry Cordner’s brief furlough is
up in a week or two. Then he returns to
Mesopotamia. ,The two Cordner brothers
were athletic celebrities in their ’Varsity
days, and are now medical majors. Ted is
still in France, where he first met the Eng-
lish V.A.D. he recently married. She was
his “right hand” owing to her skill in
languages.
The George Kelly widow spent two anxious
days last week in the belief that her elder
son, Lieutenant Charles Kelly, M.C., was a
prisoner in Germany. The suspense was
ended bv a reassuring cable from Charlie
himself.
Adelaide’s remarks:—
The new Commandant has started a giddy whirl
of money-raising- patriotic entertainments, battalion
re-unions, regimental club meetings and the rest.
He was the excuse for a Government House dinner
the other night.
Lieut. T. S. Cheadle is due back in September,
after three years’ active service.
The late Lieut. Garland’s “Vignettes of War,”
sketches and poems collected by one of his fellow
journalists on The Register and published in aid of
the Cheer-Up Society’s appeal, has run through two
editions, and advance orders will pretty well Recount
for the third, now in the press. Orders have also
rome in for practically every copy of the special
edition.
The 11. E. Fullers’ son, Basil, has been severely
wounded in France—so severely as to necessitate
amputation of the right leg.
Brig.-General Forsyth put in a few hurried days
here during the week saying good-bye.
For the next month patriotic workers will be
immersed in the Australia Day appeal for the South
Aus. Soldiers’ Fund. The big effort is billed for
later in the month, but already there have been a
good many smaller shows. A juvenile fancy-dress
ball, with Mrs. Pittendirgh and Mrs. F. W. Porter as
its organisers, is amongst the excitements looming
ahead.
There died at Hackney on Tuesday (her 7lst
birthday) Mrs. C. J. Penny, only surviving daughter
of Mr. John Stephen, at one time a proprietor of
The Register. Of her four sons one has been in-
valided home and another is with the R.A.M.C. One
of her daughters is a member of Queen Alexandra’s
Army Nursing Reserve.
The 9th Light Horse Trench Cmforts Fund reports
a healthy year’s work. Over £ll4O has been col-
lected, and 526 cases of comforts have been sent to
Palestine.
Miss d’Erlanger has returned from her trip to Mel-
bourne. ,
This State’s old friend “Tommy” Ryan was one of
this week’s speakers at the recruiting stand. Urgent
business affairs brought him to town. He and his
railway unit start for the Front within the next few
weeks.
Since it moved into its new’ premises on North
Terrace the Returned Soldiers’ Assoc, has bristled
up. Regular weekly socials are held, with the
first one in each month set aside as a. welcome'to
recently returned men. The committee has decided to
furnish five bedrooms for the use of Anzacs on
furlough.
The Guy Sherwoods’ son, Adams Sher-
wood, just back from the war, is to marry
Nancy Maslin, daughter of N. S. Wales
squatter George Maslin. Nance is an heiress
and Adams’ dad is yearning to spend money
on his soldier son. Two of Guy Sherwood’s
boys were killed at the Front.
Melba handed a cheque for £405 to Lady
Helen last week for the Red Cross. The
scrap of paper represented the proceeds of a
Melba concert on the Niagara during the
voyage to Australia.
The Tasmanian baby is even luckier than
I thought. According to some Apple Island-
ers, Launceston Baby Clinic, good as it is
takes its gruel from Hobart’s earlier effort’
In Hobart Lady Nicholls, Mrs. Waterworth
and Mrs. Tom Murdoch arranged a fort-
night’s exhibition (night and day) in the
City Hall, and made a great success of it.
Dame Melba, recently conducted a patri-
otic “Dutch auction’’ at Scott’s Hotel, of
sundries which formed the balance of’the
stock at “Our Boys’ Shop.” A bottle of
eau-de-Cologne was sold for £25 and pre-
sented to the auctioneer. The total sales
realised £3OO.
On Saturday last, when a lot of invalided
Billjims got back from over-sea, only 50 cars
were on hand to give them a lift. The
Automobile Club president had called for
150, but he had the bad luck to call on a big
race day.
Harry Paul, of Tarrant’s, is arranging a
Katinka Motor Ball for Monday, July 20. i,
will happen in Melbourne Town Hall to help
the Australian Comforts Fund. The J.C.W.
Ivatinkas have promised to help, and there
will be theatrical marches and processions.
Nettie Palmer, wife of soldier Vance, gave
a solemn sort of lecture on Bernard O’Dowd
at the Literary Club last week. She said she
was tired of the lazy people who refused to
improve their minds with his poems, on the
ground that “O’Dowd is veahly too clever
for me.” These intellectual shirkers will
find Nettie attacking them with her most
literary umbrella if they don’t look out.
Artist Cumbrae Stewart is trying not to
seem unnecessarily proud. Three of her
charming pastels. “The Model,” “Florence
Dombey” and “Model Disrobing,” have been
bought by the Ma State’s National Gallery.
Popular actor and good-fellow lteg Wyke-
ham was last reported in London yarning
with Darrell Lindsay, Bill Dyson, Benson,
D.C.M., and other Australians.
Muriel Starr, in “The Man Who Came
Back,” had a crowd of unbooked racegoers
scratching vainly at the doors of the Royal
for seats on Saturday. Amongst those inside,
Mrs. “Tatts” Curran, with daughter Paul-
ine rising well out of a black gown, were
escorted by Captain Booth, in his most
gorgeous uniform. The Crawfords were
boxed at stage-level. A girl in the upper box
was partly wrapped in a snow'-leopard skin.
In the show Muriel lightens the “lowest dive in
China” by wearing a kimono of rich silk in
church-window blues and reds. Her cabaret
frock in the first act ends towards the waist
and is a blue-black trimmed with silver.
Cousin Alice Mitchell is also economical in
bodice material, and glows from emerald-green
tulle frills. Muriel sports a white frock with
a blue-sailor collar in the Honolulu bungalow
scene, where her millionaire husband slashes
her with his riding-whip.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

For a moment after Booligal and Cobram,
jumping together, had crossed the final fence in the
Grand National Steeple last Saturday it seemed that
the Flemington crowd would soon be raising one of
the biggest shouts in the history of that popular
spectacular event. Booligal, the pacemaker for 2J
miles of the rather muddy journey, was ahead again
as they turned into the straight, and the prevailing
hope Was that the generous battler would beat the
grej in the run home, but there never was much
steam left in Booligal after going his favorite 'dis-
tance. Now that he is descending into the vale of
years and has lost a little of his old dasli he can’t
give .Toll), to even a 12-year-old stager like Cobram
at the end of a 25 furlongs’ race. The grey beat him
fairl,y in the last furlong, pony Raheny, the oldest
of the trio, running a respectable third. Half a
mile from home Doiran, from S. Aus., looked the
most likely to outlast the leader, but he struck a
fence, or tired in the ordinary way, and lost his
position. After which only Booligal and Cobram
were in it.
* * * *
Mentioning the chance of Cobram the
other week The Bulletin remarked that they would
have to be a bad lot in the G.N. if Cobram was to
win. The paragraph might have added that the pace
would have to be slow. The race fulfilled those two
conditions. The time was 13 seconds slower than
when Old Mungindi and Caibye, with Waimai in
pursuit, made Cobram and others look forlorn hopes
a year ago. They were a poor lot, bar Booligal,
who can no longer make a very hot pace, and is not
a good enough stayer to make a final effort over the
National course. And Cobram, the string-halted grey
son of Bundook, is certainly a better _ animal than
he was three years ago. The old Carbine blood has
matured with age, like good wine. Or lie makes
his jumps with far less effort. Both winner and
runner-up are grandsons of Carbine, who begot some
notably successful sires of junipers, though he him-
self declined to look at a hurdle in his racing days.
* * * *
The ground at Flemington last Saturday
was not sufficiently wet to be slippery, and only two
of the G, N. Steeplers came to actual grief. Another
hit a rail hard enough to shift his rider, and one was
pulled up. Nine of the 13 starters finished the course,
old Coradjill being whipper-in. Yet he was the only
starter, bar Booligal, that had any National form to
his credit. Coradjill won the race in 1916 and was
placed third in ’l3 and ’l4. Booligal, with 12st.
up, finished third in ’l5 and ran second in the Aus-
tralian Steeplechase at Caulfield the same year.
The Sydney champions, Greek Fire ard Jack Rice,
were among the “nowheres” in the Doutta Galla
Hurdles, but a few punters from across the Murray
got a bit of their own back when the Rajah’s horse,
Lord Nagar, ran away with the Trial Hurdle. The
winner had previously blundered so badly at the
jumps that he was on offer at 10’s ere he started at
3’s. Nothing had a chance with the big fellow this
time. He had only to stand up to win easily, and he
cleared the hurdles as though he liked the job.
Red Signal emphasised his return to the form he
showed as a two-year-old by winning the last race of
the Y.R.C. meeting in brilliant style. It was his
third win within a fortnight. Had he been entered
for the Cups the son of Linacre would have got in at
a fairly easy weight, and have now appeared to be the
pick of the handicaps.
Hurdle-racer Ilayston, formerly a terror at the
.starting-igate, seems to be settling down into a
reasonable performer. On Saturday he got well away
for the Doutta Galla, and was content to be ridden a
discreet race in the first flight until it was time for
him to take the lead and keep it. “Mr. Rawdon,”
now* on his way to England, will be sorry that he
parted with the ex-rebel, for Hayston, like Narah-
quong, has been put to hurdles without being
deprived of his horsehood.
». * * #
“0.K.”: When outsider Narahquong ran
away with the G. N. Hurdle at Flemington he had,
in addition to his good breeding and bottom weight,
the distinction of being the only stallion in a field of
geldings. It happened that the long Australian
Hurdle Race at Caulfield last year also fell to the
only stallion on the job. People mostly think of
jumping races as practically confined to horses that
will never be wanted at the stud, for there are very
few mares in the business, and stallions used to be
reckoned too valuable and uncertain to be employed
in anything so risky. The success of imported
Polygamist last August, and the case of Narahqnong
last Week suggest that stallions of small importance
on the flat may be well worth trying over the sticks.
Narahquong shows special aptitude for the “illegiti-
mate” game, and jumps like the proverbial stag,
whereas Polygamist was the clumsiest jumper that
ever got away with a big hurdle race. Virility
counts jn clearing the sticks as in fast races on the
flat. NOW. that the biggest hurdle events at Flem-
ington and Caulfield have been captured by horses
which were not unsexed a lot more of them will
surely be given a chance, with the result that the
“class” of hurdlers in general will improve con-
siderably.
* * * *
“Spreader”: Narahquong’s brilliant per-
formance in the Grand National Hurdles helps to
bear out my argument that Camel was the great
influence in the Carbine branch of the Musket blood,
and a. rich return of Camel to Carbine’s descendants
is indicated when trying to breed a topnotcher. If
there’s anything in the orthodox theory of mating,
then Mary Lee brought to Amberite exactly what the
doctor ordered in the shape of suitable blood; as
the result, Narahquong is bred on the lines of Car-
bine down to the nearest detail. All the experts
are agreed that Carbine owed his greatness to Brown
Bess, daughter of Camel, but they forget Mersey’s
share in the business and let Musket get away with
the bulk of the limelight. If there’s any possible
way of accounting for Narahquong’s brilliant per-
formance by juggling with the names in his pedigree,
it s because Mary Lee gave Amberite a return of
the magic Brown Bess (by Camel) as well as Musket
and Nevvminster, the latter two being descendants
of Camel’s in male line through different channels.
Sydney raeing dates for the year be-
ginning on August 1, “approved by the District
Commandant'’ —who shouldn t have anything to do
with the business —provide for 97 days on the “inner
circle” —49 days of horse, 32 of pony and 16 of
trotter. The allowance on the “outer circle,’ for
such places as Menangle, Kembla and others of the
kind, has yet to be fixed. In the country there are
to be 500 days’ horse-racing, no days for the ponies
and 48 days for trots. In the city the A.J.C. gets
14 days, Tattersall's four and City Tatt.’s two. These
clubs race at Randwick, and their days are kept clear
of pony interruption. There* will be nine days’ racing
at Rosehill during the year, and six days on the
Canterbury, Moorefield and Warwick Farm courses,
the programme being so arranged that each gets two
days clear of pony opposition. This leaves 19 days
on which there will be “clash” meetings. Each of
the four pony clubs gets eight days, and of the 32
there will be 13 “clear” of horse opposition. Hawkes-
bury is handed two days solus. The four proprietary
horse clubs get 27 days, eight of them clear. The
four pony clubs are allotted 32 days, and five more
clear fixtures than the horse institutions. Share-
holders in the pony joints have nothing to grumble
about.
* * * *
At Victoria Park pony track (Sydney)
10 races were run on Saturday. Of these three were
won by nags sired by Moorefield. The other winners
were by Maltster, Yetman (imp.), Challenger (imp.),
Et Soult, Sir Aymer . (imp.), Linacre (imp.) and
Cooitrim (imp.). Little King, a full-brother to the
champion miler of a few years back, Malt King, won
the 14.2 Handicap. He carried Bst. and cut the six
furlongs out in “17” —not bad going when it is con-
sidered that the nags had a heavy wind blowing
against them most of the trip. Little King isn’t
much to look at, but he certainly unwinds a wonder-
ful sprint over the last couple of furlongs of a short
trip.
Sydney’s champion pony mare, Lady Liddell,
added to her fame at Victoria Park on Saturday. She
carried 12st. 41b. in the 14.1 Handicap, and was only
beaten by a whisker on the post hy Molly Blackwell, a
Queensland mare in receipt of 4st. 41b. from the little
grey flier. The five furlongs was run in “4.” For the
first three furlongs Lady Liddell and Carey Moore,
both of them greys, were out in front well clear of
the field. Then Lady Liddell drew out, and just as
she looked to have the race won the Bananalander
fell from the clouds and hit the judge in the eye.
*■**.*
When the weights for the two Cups struck
Westralia and the local racing men noticed that Negro
bad been handed Bst. in the two-mile event and 7st.
111 b. in the mile and a half, they refused to believe
that it wasn’t a dream. This nag, an imported
animal, raced in the West by A. E. Cockram, has
never yet won a race. Worse than that, he has
been made look like a hack by nags that could no
more win a race at Flemington or Randwick than
fly. Second-raters have given him lumps of weight
and beaten him —maidens have walloped the hoofs
off him. Now on the Melbourne Cun assessment
of worth he is reckoned to be within 61b. of Shadow-
land, 41b. of Prince Bardolph and lib. of Colbert,
and is put down as better than Early Morn, Rael
Locin, King Offa —has to give 111 b. to the record
breaker Arch Marella, and give substantial weight to
Outlook, Red Fox, Dunwil and Sweet Lady. In the
Caulfield Cup he is counted better than Bee, Silent'
Way, Haitachi, Promised Land, Baltic Sea, Rosanna
(all good winners) and the pick of the coming three-
year-olds. Probably the handicappers wondered
whether the nomination of a prad with Negro’s record
for these two big races was not equivalent to a procla-
mation that the horse’s Westralian form was all wrong.
There is something to be said for this view, for if it
was dinkum the reason for pushing him into the list
for Flemington and Caulfield surpasses all understand-
ing. But the same view might just as well be taken
of 75 per cent, of the other horses, and then handi-
capping would become a jest of great magnitude.
* * * *
“Spreader” : The Way to bring the straight-
out, tote into the boom would be to register the in-
vestments on a machine that displayed the aggregate
amount as usual, but did not disclose the individual
figures until the machine closed ; say, three minutes
before registered starting time. Worked this way the
big commissions would go on irrespective of the state
of the poll at the time they were put through the
pay-window.
To which The Bulletin adds that if anyone else
thinks this way he ought to forget it. The notion
was tried at Wellington (M.L.), and it was such a
calamitous failure that it had to be abandoned in the
middle of the proceedings to stop the public from
stampeding.
* * * #
“Bolwarrah”; A * syndicate of our office
youths drew a horse in the G. N. Hurdle, and wired
the nominator asking his terms. He promptly and
modestly replied: “Wire £5O deposit and guarantee
one-third total winnings, or will scratch.” He was
informed that he wouldn’t get the terms if his horse
was favorite instead of being an “also nominated.”
But the part that really hurt the boys was that
though they sent a reply-paid wire in the first
instance the pirate-owner ignored the return half and
sent a full-rate wire “collect.”

After the mare Etal arrived at Rock-
hampton (Q.) from Melbourne recently she won a
race unbacked and lost another in which she carried
a heavy wad. Then she was taken on to Townsville
and saddled up on Saturday for the Farewell Handi-
cap. She opened favorite in the betting, but before
she got out on to the track she was examined by the
stewards, and what they discovered blew everything
up in the air. The mare’s tongue had been so
tightly tied with a piece of tane back near the root
that the organ was almost black. The mare, the
reputed owner (Cormaek) and the jockey (Thompson),
who at the last minute wasn’t well enough to ride,
were disqualified for life. It was announced, also,
that the stewards intended to prosecute “a small fair
man” wno had allegedly been detected doing the
tongue-tying act. The individual who stuck needles
into a nags fetlock up at Cowra (N.S.W.) the other
day seemed to have got to about the limit of fiend-
ishness, but this push appears to have run him a
dead heat lor the Barbarity Stakes.
The well-known Port Jackson open-boat-
sailer, William Beattie, died suddenly the other day
at Cockatoo Island, lie was the owner of Hero and
Vision, eighteen-footers, which he built himself.
With the latter he won championships.

Sydney T. Brooks, killed in action in
France, was for years the champion swimmer of
Sydney s Eastern Suburbs, and one of the Bondi life-
saving team. After enlisting he became musketry-
and bombing-instructor, and wore a sergeant’s stripes
for his efforts in India and in France. Last May he
won the swimming championship of his brigade at
Amiens. End at 21.
* * * *
Killed in an aeroplane accident in Eng-
land, J. S. W. Lord, an all-round Sydney athlete.
Before the whistle blew for the big game in Europe
Lord played first-grade liugby football with East
Sydney, and was also a first-rank swimmer and life-
saver and a handy man with the gloves. He served
his time as engineer with the Colonial Sugar Co., and
was a fitter in the Government railway shops (Syd-
ney) when the Kaiser started trouble. Lord left with
Australia s first Light Horse contingent in October,
1914, and went through several scraps in Egypt and
thereabouts. Joining the Flying Corps last year, he
won his wings and a commission. His pal, L. L.
George, also an Australian, was killed in the same
place on the same day.

“T. 0.1.”: Charley Lawrence, recently
mentioned, was with the first All England Eleven
(1861-2), and he remained in Australia under engage-
ment to a Sydney club, the Albert, whose ground
was a “proprietary” at Redfern, now built over.
Lawrence was a Aliddlesex man by birth, but. by
residing at Mitcham he qualified for Surrey. Then
he went to Edinburgh, afterwards crossed ova - to
Dublin (where a relative kept a “sports” shop in
Sackville-street), and became secretary to the United
All Ireland XI. He was a fast bowler, a good bat
and an excellent judge of tlie game. In 1868 be
took a team of aboriginal cricketers from Australia
to England, playing many matches, but the finish
was not creditable. On returning he got an appoint-
ment. as a clerk in the Railway Department at New-
castle, where he remained for some years.

One of Maoriland’s staunch Rugbyites,
William Allardyce, has gone over the Great Goal
Line. In the early ’SO’s, when football was a
religion over yonder, Allardyce was a giant. In “big”
Rugby he pulled on the Canterbury jersey against
Wellington, Otago, Auckland, Hawkes Bay and South
Canterbury, and did his bit against N. S. Wales in
’B6 and'the wandering Englishmen of 'BB. He was a
great worker—stalwart and straight.

N. S. Wales Rugby League premiership
scramble is near shutter-time. Two rounds only are
left on the slate, and the result of the clash between
Wests and Souths on the corning Saturday will pro-
bably decide which will hold the premiership. These
clubs’ efforts have resulted thuswise
Comp-
Won. Lost. Drawn. For. Against. Points.
Souths .. 9 2 0 218 99 18
Wests .. 9 2 0 149 76 18
The others are out of the rush.

The goal-kicking of W. McPherson, the
gritty Western Suburbs five-eighth, has pulled the
club through each week-end. Against Glebe on Satur-
day Wests were struggling heavily with two tries
against three, when the midget’s boot landed three
, goals and sent the team home happy—l 4 points to
13. McPherson’s goal-tally now stands at 28, with
A. Oxford (Souths) 25, C. Fraser (Balmain) 20, and
Frank Burge (Glebe) 18, next on the list. McPherson
also headed the goal-kicking for Wests in ’l6 (11
goals) and 1917 (19 goals). He seems the most
useful person the club has on the premises.

Broken Hill has a sour memory, when it
likes. A football team from there has been plaving
some matches in Adelaide with clubs of the “Patri-
otic Association,” which alone keeps the game going
in the southern city. One game had been arranged
for the visitors . with the S.A. police, but B.H.
declined to play. It turned out that they had been
warned that they would be disqualified when thej-
got back home if. they carried out a fixture with
the police, because 50 of that body were sent to
Broken Hill to assist in keeping order during the
strike a year ago.

“Longy”: A pal of mine, now dead, who
followed the game of punting on prads, pigeons,
whippets, hazards, two-up and Murrain on the
Westralian goldfields in the late ’nineties, went broke
in a school in a Kalgoorlie billiard saloon one mid-
night. He quitted the smoke-fogged' room for the
street, where he asked and' got credit for three hot
pies from an itinerant vendor. He consumed one
and took the others back into the school, where he
easily traded them for a zack each to hungry players.
The resultant capital of a shilling enabled him to
subscribe to the next pool, and the 16 came his way
—prize 10 bob. (All the alleys from 1 to 16 were in,
and the chief robber of the place took only 6s. out of
every full pool.) The cobber in the next throwout
bet 9s. on the side, got the 15 against a man with
the 5, and continued on with a phenomenal trot of
luck till 3 a.rn., when he buttoned up on 75
of the yellowest and best —all off two pies. Any old-
time Golden-miler will corroborate this narrative.
* * * *
“Q”: Does “Surat” (B. 4/7/T8) get
moon-illness, or does he merely suffer from attacks
of incredulity? Anyway, I hereby take oath that the
hare I shot was sitting at a distance of 104 yards
when it received the pellets, and that the cartridge
used was a “smokeless” ; that the fox and the kero
sene-tin were fired at with “smokeless” and black
jju.vuer respectively. The manufacturers say that
their cartridges are loaded with powder that varies
quantity from 2jdr. to 3.1 dr. The fact that
“Surat’s” 50-guinea ornament could only make 11
dints in a tin with No. 4 shot at 60 yards does not
disprove my statements because: (1) lie used Mo. 1
shot, thereby giving my gun the advantage in
penetrating power, as 1 used No. 2. (2) Victories
at pigeon-matches are little, recommendation for a
gun’s efficiency, as it is more the skill of the shooter
than anything else that gains victory. (3) The fact
that a weapon cost 50 guineas doesn’t necessarily
indicate that it is any better for shpoting with than
a 10-guinea one. The man who gives such a stun
for a gun is generally an extravagant individual
who pays about 10 guineas for implement value and
the other 40 guineas or so for ornamentation. A
weapon viewed as a working commodity reaches the
height of the gun-maker’s perfection at about £lO
or £l5. Let “5.,” who shied at my previous state-
ments, consider the gun my dad once had. With it
he could lodge 100 grains of No. 6 shot inside a 6in.
circle at 100 yards, He explains that the thing
was accomplished by placing only one thin wad
between the powder and shot in his home-loaded cart-
ridges. Some guns are mechanical freaks.
* * * *
“Pick 7 ’: Arguing against the possibility of
murdering a hare at 104yds. with a shotgun, “Surat”
(B. 4/7/18) omitted to take into consideration tin
fluke shots that fall to the luck of every bombarder.
The best guns fail, at times, at easy distances. On
the other hand, the commonest implement will oeen
sionally kill at an astounding range, if one pellet
therefrom strikes the quarry in a particularly vital
spot. I once saw Tom Styles, a Shoalhaven fui
hunter, kill a swamp wallaby—admittedly a tough
animal—with a five-guinea breech-loader, No. 2 shot,
at 85yds. The distance was taped on the level.
And A. It. Wilkin (South Coast cheese expert) had
a hammerless weapon which he would back to kill
at l)oyds. every time, though some shots from it
failed at half that distance. That gun’s best record
was two whistler ducks, out of a mob 110yds. away.
* * * *
Golding, the old jeweller jyist
dead at Hobart, was in his younger days a : great
performer with the rifle. 11c was the first Aus-
tralian team that visited the Cold Country, and was
the only Australian to reach the second stage of the
Queen’s. He was something of a yachtsman, too, and
ran the first steam launch on the Derwent. It was
imported from England in the. 80's. ' .
* * * *
“Crow”: Of course there is simply nothing
to be said for a place tote out of which the -receiver
of a dividend may get back less than he put in.
They ran the instrument differently at Port Elisabeth
(South Africa) when I was managing the machine
for the local racing club and haven’t changed since.
The principle worked on there was that a backer
must get his - stake back. For instance, supposing
after deduction of commission, £lOOO is left in the
pool for division among ticket-holders on three horses
A B and C, backed for £4OO, £9O and £7B respec-
tively. This £ 568, being the investors’ stake, is
deducted, thus leaving £432 for division according
to the ratio of investors’ interests. This puts £144
into each group, so A ticket gets 7s. plus the £i
stake, or a £1 7s. div., B £1 12s. plus £1 (£2
125.), and O £1 10s. 9d. plus £1 (£2 16s. 9d.).
By this means the backer for a place doesn’t lose
if he succeeds in doing what he was trying to do.
For a man to back a horse for a place and then col-
lect less than he put up is about the wildest farce
ever staged on a racecourse.


There is a WAY to Perfecft
Health.
That way is open to you. Will you travel it ?
The only way to improve Nature is through NATURAL
methods.
Drugs and apparatus usually show no results and are otten
injurious. Under my method 15 minutes each day in your
own room is sufficient. I have thousands of students in all
parts of Australia and New Zealand who are now enjoying
good health. Previously a great number of these people
were sufferers from indigestion, constipation and other dis-
orders which are the direct result of the internal muscles
being- much below normal.
My exercises pay particular attention to the muscles that
govern the action of the stomach, liver and bowels, and
quickly bring them back to a healthy state again.
Surely you want to enjoy the best of health ? Then why not
write to-day for full particulars of my

This is proof of what I say:—
“Dear Sir, —I have practised the third set of exercises,
together with the other sets, and feel stronger than ever.
I have increased 91b. in weight.
“Yours faithfully,

Many hundreds of letters from pupils throughout Australia

Why Have Grey Hair?
Few people know that grey hair is not a
necessary feature of age—that it can be
avoided without resorting to hair dyes. A
very old, home-made remedy will turn the
hair back to a natural color in a few days.
It is only necessary to get from the chemist
two ounces of concentrate of tammalite and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this simple lotion to the hair for a few nights
with a small sponge and you will soon have
the pleasure of seeing the greyness disappear.
This recipe is perfectly harmless, is neither
sticky nor greasy and lias given perfect satis-
faction for many generations to those in
possession of the secret.
Blackheads, Oily Pores, etc.
The new sparkling face-bath treatment rids
(he skin of blackheads, oiliness and enlarged
pores almost instantly. It is perfectly harm-
less, pleasant and immediately effective. All
you have to do is to drop a stymol tablet,
obtained from the chemist, in a glass of hot
water, and after the resulting effervescence
has subsided dab the affected portions of the
face freely with the liquid. When you dry
the face you will find that the blackheads
come right off on the towel, the large pores
contract and efface themselves and the greasi-
ness is all gone, leaving the skin smooth, soft
and cool. This treatment should be repeated
a few times at intervals of several days in
order to make sure that the result shall be
permanent.
The Magnetism of Beautiful Hair.
Beautiful hair adds immensely to the per-
sonal magnetism of both men and women.
Actresses and smart women are ever on the
look out for any harmless thing that will in-
crease the natural beauty of their hair. The
latest method is to use pure stallax as a sham-
poo on account of the peculiar glossy, fluffy
and wavy effect which it leaves. As stallax
has never been used much for this purpose it
comes to the chemist only in £lb. sealed origi-
nal packages, enough for 25 or 30 shampoos.
A teaspoonful of the fragrant stallax gran-
ules, dissolved in a cup of hot water, is more
than sufficient for each shampoo. It is very
beneficial and stimulating to the hair apart
from its beautifying effect.
How to Remove a Bad Complexion.
Cosmetics can never really help a poor com-
plexion; often they are positively harmful,
'file sensible, rational way is to actually re-
move the thin veil of stifling, half-dead scarf-
skin from the face, and give the fresh, vigor-
ous and beautiful young skin underneath a
chance to show itself and to breathe.
This is best done in a very simple way, by
merely applying mercolised wax at night, like
cold cream, and washing it off in the morning.
Good mercolized wax can be obtained from
any well-stocked chemist. It absorbs the dis-
figuring cuticle gradually and harmlessly,
leaving a brilliant natural complexion. Of
course, this also takes with it all such facial
blemises as red blotches, tan, moth patches.
sallownesS, liver spots, pimples, etc. As a
freckle remover and general complexion beau-
tifier this old-fashioned remedy is unequalled.
The Powder Puff Passes.
Every normal woman is always interested
in any plan by which she can quickly enhance
her beauty, provided the plan is perfectly safe
and simple. Ever since the discovery that
ordinary eleminite, such as any chemist can
supply, is an instantaneous and harmless
beautifier, there has been a growing demand
for it from smart women everywhere. They
usually get about an ounce and add just
enough water to dissolve it. A little of this
perfectly harmless lotion gives a beautiful
complexion to any face instantly. It renders
face powder quite unnecessary. Moreover, its
use cannot be detected. The skin is instantly
beautified but appears perfectly natural
under the closest scrutiny. [3

Arthur R.: Well, you try the Red Cross
toy depta in George-street, Sydney. You’ll get there
a Noah's Ark and animals that will beat anything
of the kind ever imported... .J.L. (Barcaldine):
Fine advertisement for the Awful Climate, but can’t
find a place for the photograph... .Jack C.: Don’t
remember them. Were they suggestions for illus-
trations or pars ? In any case, if they appear, cut
out and send to accountant. .. .Prospector: Off our
beat; write to the Mines Department, Adelaide....

them... .M. 8.: Landscape verse that doesn’t hitch
on somewhere to human thought and feeling has no
chance.. . .Yvonne: But why use the villanelle when
you admit you can’t say anything in it?.,.. E.J.:
Don’t care for it.... Desert Gold: Verse not up....
J.C.: Poorest sort of bragging verse... .V.K.Q.: You
won’t do it with that sort of stuff... .M.B. P.: Cor-
rect verse, but no novelty or strength... .J.V.F.:
Feeble attempt R.S.: “Coo-ee” too rough and
careless. .. .C.N.: Very lame. ...A.L.8.: Goes back.
...Hamara Tokn: Try again... .Wauchope: Not yet,
young ’un... .Inkslinger: Rotten... .J. 11.: So near
and yet’ so far Druid’s Oak: Not up... .11.5. L.:
Promising for a start. Now go ahead; but don’t
leap all at once.. a E.D.: The lament falls over its
feet too frequently K.D.L.: The manner is all
right; but the yarn isn’t attractive... .W.E.8.:
Brightly written, about nothing worth writing
brightly... .11. If.: Not quite; but back your pen in

about this:—
Although its hard to hymn the Kaiser,
Or to outline his miserable and wretched life;
We can only value him as a kreutzner,
His life we could take so lief.
He would never be missed if he were to vanish,
All thoughts of him would soon be forgotten ;
For such a miserable (I won’t say) to vanquish,
All thoughts of him alone is rotten.
May he read these lines before he dines,
And never see another sunshine;
But go away and quietly pine,
For his heart and soul will go to feed the swine.

work. ...8.G.: “Dinkum” won’t do. Read some good

They “carry on” in a quiet way, and the
units attached to battalions in France and
England have made many a man fit for the
trenches who without their skill would be
useless. . Recently the units attached 'to
three brigades in Blighty were praised by
General Birdwood for the excellent work and
the record time of making hundreds of men
fit for reinforcements for France.
From Palestine:—
The Australian horse is a marvel. He has got all
other means of transport here beat to a finish, and
you would not believe the hardships and work he
can put up with. It’s hats off to the Waler every
time... .There is no beer left in Beersheba. We
bought the last nine bottles for 110 piastres....!
know what became of the ten Lost Tribes of Israel.
They came to Palestine* and the chats ate them.
They (the chats) are big enough to practise bayonet-
fighting on. We inseetibane our clothes and stab
them as they gallop out. I have seen most of the
historical places here and don’t think much of them.
I know lots of better places. We seem to have been
here for a lifetime, but as Moses and his push stood
it for 40 years, I suppose an Australian mob cau put
up with it till the row is ended. P.S.—I would
sooner bathe in the Yarra than the Jordan.
“Umntu”: Another piece of old Sydney is
soon to disappear—Barker’s mill is to be
placed in the hands of the demolishers. This
historic old building housed the second steam-
engine brought to Sydney. Thomas Barker,
who made a success of his ventures and
became one of the early members of the
N. S. Wales Legislature, got a grant of seven
acres at the corner of Bathurst and Sussex
streets and running down to Darling Har-
bor. H -e in 1823 he erected his steam
flourmill. Sydney was used to mills ; it had
had hand-power mills, foot-power mills, wind-
mills and water-mills, but a steam-power mill
was a novelty. The inhabitants dubbed this
new show “Barker’s Steam Engine.” In
1830 Barker erected two new flourmills
alongside his original one, and the Sydney-
ites of the day looked on the then colossal
undertaking with amazement. Its memory
is perpetuated in “Steam Mill-street.”

A Tim? for Strong Nerves.
War time, with its excitement and
hysteria, is a trial to the strongest nerves.
To those whose nervous systems are run
down by overwork or worry, to those who
are on the verge of neurasthenia, it is a time
of danger.
There is no tonic for the nerves that is
not a tonic for every other part of the body.
There is no form of debility that does not
rob the nerves of nourishment. The remedy
therefore for nervous breakdown is a tonic
that will build up the general health,
revitalise the blood and enable it to carry to
the nerves the elements that they need.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are an ideal tonic
for this condition because they are non-
alcoholic, and neurasthenic patients should
avoid alcoholic stimulants.
Write for the free booklet, “Diseases of
the Nervous System,” to the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co., Box 594 G.P.0., Sydney.
Your own chemist or storekeeper sells the
p'lls. or they will be sent, post paid, at 2/9

THE thing that the people should have

One of our small anomalies is the spec-
tacle of an impassioned orator standing up
on a platform made of imported timber, in
front of a G-P.O. built out of imported loans,
urging the people to be proud of Australia
and to go away in somebody else's ship to
uphold its flag—which wasn’t made here
either. In fact, if the material of the flag is
three or more years old the dye came from
Germany.
* * * *
Treasurer McPherson/ of Victoria, lias
stirred a hornets’ nest in butting up against
the Tvpothetse combine. He was bold
enough to say that, as the Government was
experiencing difficulty in getting its printing
requirements at reasonable rates, and mer-
chants were tendering only for certain lines,
if, looked as though the aforesaid merchants
were “putting their heads together.” The
Chief Government Printer, Mullett, was
therefore to visit America, on behalf of the
Vic., N. S. Wales and Commonwealth Gov-
ernments, to secure supplies. James Gates,
attorney for J. Spicer and Sons, paper
importers, next day through the press prac-
tically told McPherson that he was himseli
a member of a machinery merchants’ combine.
Later he attacked McPherson in the advertis-
ing pages of the Age, Argus and Herald. The
controversy showed great bitterness of feel-
ing. There is a history behind it. Repre-
sentatives of McPherson’s firm gave evidence
before the Typothetae Commission, and
apparently this fact has not been forgotten.
Tenders received from Victorian merchants
by McPherson’s for printing a certain cata-
logue were within a shilling or two of each
other. The same thing applied to the paper
required. McPherson’ got his paper from
abroad, saved £2OO, and had the catalogue
quietly printed in Sydney, thereby saving an
additional £300! During a subsequent elec-
tion campaign Mac was taken to task for
going outside the State for his requirements,
but when he related the facts and mentioned
the .names* of the firms concerned, he made
friends in the electorate, but lasting enemies
in the paper and printing trade.
* * * *
“F. 8.”: In 1914-15 the Queensland rail-
ways earned £4 Os. Bd. per cent. In the
financial year just finished they panned out
at £1 10s. per cent., a falling-away for
three years almost without a parallel in
Australia. Revenue in 1914-15 was
£3,532,003, as against £4,020,752 in 191 < -18,
so the trouble can’t be attributed to a wan-
ing income. This year the Department,
after paying working expenses, has £599,989
wherewith to meet an interest bill or
£1,678,193, which implies a shortage of
£1,078.204. In the face of this Treasurer
Theodore had the nerve to talk about the
“successful operation of Government busi-
nesses and undertakings.”
* * *
“J.E.0.”: Tasmanian white, or Huon,
pine, is slowly but surely being cut out, and
it is only a matter of a few years when this
most valuable softwood will be unprocurable.
The trade is controlled by Melbourne syndi-
cates, and very little, if any, is allowed to
find its way to the Tassy markets. The life
of Huon pine is practically unlimited. It
defies wet of dry weather, and is unsurpass-
able for boat-building and joinery work of
all descriptions. It is almost immune from
attacks by the toreador. The King William
and celery-top pines, also indigenous tS the
West Coast, Tas., are being exploited by
mainland investors. The K.W. is very
limited in quantity and grows only on the
high mountain tops. Celery is more plenti-
ful. They are both valuable timbers, free
from shrinkage, can be used as soon as cut,
and can be guaranteed not to either warp or
shrink. This is a quality possessed, as far as
I know, by no other timber. Like white pine,
it is a very slow grower and is usually
faulty. Celery is hard, knotty and sound,
and grows more rapidly.
# # * *
“8.J.”: A wood-merchant was prosecuted
at Camberwell (Vic.) the other day under
the Weights and Measures Act. A housewife
ordered 2cwt. of Mallee roots, demanded that
the carter should weigh the load on scales
obtained by her, and found it to be 321 b.
short. It looked as if the fuel pirate would
be sharply fined by the Co.urt. but the
Gent. One defending him pointed out that
the Act specified that the wood must be
weighed in the course of transit or in the
store, and the Beak solemnly decided that he
could not convict. The prosecution looked
dazed and asked if the public had no redress ;
the answer was that it hadn’t unless the fool-
built Act was amended.
* * * *
“8.1. D.”: The other day I agreed to buy
a quarter of a hundredweight of potatoes
from a merchant who peddled round to my
back door. When lie brought in a skimpy
looking collection I had the scales handy
and asked him to humor my curiosity by
letting me weigh the consignment. “All
right, mum.” he said, “but there’s a few more
to come yet.” There was —about 81b.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We see a fine merino sheep
Australia young and tall
Has by the ear, and pause to heap
Our epithets on all
Who link our swarming woolly flocks
For aye to this mad paradox.
Of that sheep’s wool is spun away
A shred down to the sea;
Across the Indian Ocean’s play
It travels ceaselessly.
From Suez runs by many lands
To pass at length through Yorkshire hands.
Then back it threads by night and day
Its long, lone tidal sweep
To where that fellow holds the grey,
Obtuse merino sheep,
And gives him after this mad trek
A shirt his foolish back to deck.
Elaborately draws in line,
With map of land and sea,
Where runs the yarn, this quaint design
Our coat of arms should be,
And ’ncath it set with some display
Australia's -motto, “Wool Away !”

There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort und -ood
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible bl-
eeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks aud charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.

harden the gums aud disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decav).

Miss Grace Lavers is one of the prettiest

Sydney as the young wife in Oh, Boy, in
which she made her debut at Her Majesty s
Theatre recently. Miss Lavers uses .Rexona
Soap for her beautiful hair, and joins the
Kexona Girls’ Club with these words:—
I am delighted with
your Rexona Soap,
and am sending you
my photograph to show
how much good it has
done my hair. I have
been using it now for
nearly three months,
and it makes the hair
so soft and fluffy that
I am always going to
continue to use it.
Rexona Soap is miles
ahead of anything I
have ever tried before.
Hair tonics and sham-
poos do nothing like
the good that Rexona
Soap does. I should
think that every girl
would use it, and I am
sure they do if they
have once tried it. It
is so good for the coni-
plexion, too, it leaves
the skin so clear and
fresh. „ _
I have a pot of Rex-
ona Ointment, too; it
really is a rapid healer.
I have found it excel-
lent for preventing
sunburn. I can assure
you I shall always go
out of my way to praise
Rexona.

The Kingdom.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HAVE a dream of a quiet State
Where a goodly king would rule,
With a house of books at the palace gate
And a little white-walled school.
There trees wou.d grow before tue wall
And flowers about the trees ;
And the queen would go in cap and shawl
To tend her hens and bees.
A wheel would spin at an open door
And a loom would click near by;
And a man of might at the thresuing-floor
Would make the white chaff fly.
There would be sheep on the hills above
And corn in the fields below;
And each would have room to seek and love
The thing that was good to know.
The king w,ould go out with a team to plough
And a prince would harrow the soil;
And a statesman come with a thoughtful
brow
And a spade for his daily toil.
And one would draw r a tiddle-bow
i And one would make a song ;
And a man and a maid would softly go
In the dusk and think no wrong.
The boys at their play would run and shout
And the girls dance round in a ring;
And a father-thought would wrap them about
And a mother-thought would sing
To their brave hearts always in shine or
shade,
Till the youngest child must know
How the dimpled fairy steps have made
The path where their feet may go.
There would be pride in the walk of the king
And pride in the craftsman’s hand;
And all the wealth that the years could bring
Would lie in the sweet of the land.
Fine green words would the tall trees say
Below the moon and the sun ;
And a man would bless the shining day
For joy of his work begun.
Out of the treasure of written books
And the magic of spoken song
Would the people gather their golden looks
From a dream that was fine and long;
And laughter would blow like a merry wind
To ruffle the of men;
For the breathing soil would be very kind
And kinder the breathing pen.
And there would we sing God save the King
And the royal race he bore,
While the good earth’s tribute we loved to
bring
And lay at his palace door.
The word that he spoke would be our word,
And his fear would be our fear;
And the land would whitep to one keen sword
If the step of the foe drew near.
H.S.W.

How We Saved the Wireless.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT’S a long time since the war started,
but if it were twice as long, or as long
as you like, I’d still remember how we
defended the Wireless and saved our town.
It happened several times.
The first offence took place on a Saturday
afternoon, above all times, and I was just
having a bath. A cove dashed up the veran-
dah steps shouting: “Turn out at once!
Turn out. Brown, and report at the Wire-
less !” (That’s my name—Brown.)
He didn’t give me time to reply, but
dashed off again (everybody dashed that day
except me. I never could dash—l chafe if
I dash), and I heard the same thing at the
next house: “Turn out at once! Turn out,
Jolly, and report at the Wireless!” And so
on down the street. (Jolly is my neighbor.)
About a month later, when things had
quietened down a bit, we (i.e., Jolly and I)
exchanged confidences. It seems that his
cook was cutting his hair at the time and
was about half-way through. There’s no
barber in Uusivu, so the cook sometimes does
it.
Well, I stopped having a bath and Jolly
stopped having his hair cut, and we met on
the road (I got dressed first; the wife, before
kissing me good-bye, insisted on this), and
down the town and out towards the Wireless
we perspired.
Near the Gap we picked up a lot of the
others, and I said to Week (that’s the small
bald-headed chap in the Customs) :
“What’s the strength of it, Week? True
bill this time, or another mulga?”
“You’ll know whether it’s a mulga or not,”
Week replied, “when you find the shells of
the Gneisenau knocking that wind-vane of
yours to pieces.” (I was the weather clerk
in those days.)
Now, I shut up when I heard this, be-
cause Week’s information is pretty reliable
as a rule (excepting as regards the arrival
of boats) ; but some of the others chipped
in, and by the time we got to the Wireless
there was a big argument on. I thought at
the time that it was just as well the Wire-
less is where it is.
Anyhow, we fell in as wfc had been taught
to do, and were soon told that enemy ships
were about. We were to defend the Wire-
less at all costs until help arrived, and with
this purpose in view we w«ere allotted certain
stations.
I tried to get in with the Town Guard,
thinking of the missus, but Faddy, who was
boss of our squad, sat on the proposition,
and I didn’t raise the question again.
When the orders had sunk in a little,
Faddy took a couple of paces forward.
“Shon!” he sang out.
“Slo —shoulder —er —what I mean to say,
si—ope—harms!”
The other squads sniggered at this, and
the Commandant had to raise his voice ; but
Faddy had the next order off his chest.
“By—the—right—left will!”
“Mr. Faddy,” said the Commandant,
"just take your time and think of what
you’re saying.”
But Faddy was too confused to reply. Be-
sides, we had a move on by then, so it
didn’t matter.
I was one of the twelve-to-four watch,
with Week and Jolly and another chap as
mates, and was carefully told, for the tenth
time, that no one was to approach the
barbed wire encircling the station without
being challenged. The password for the
night, I remember, was “Alls well; the
Sydnev’s coming.” If anything happened
that aroused the slightest suspicion, a shot
was to be fired, on which the whole guard
was to turn out.
By the time all these things were settled
it w r as about 8 o'clock, so I thought of tinn-
ing in. There were eight of us in our
tent, or rather fly, and we had some diffi-
culty in adjusting ourselves. I put down a
blanket and made a pillow of some sand-
wiches the missus had put up for me, and
was quite prepared for forty winks when
bang goes a shot quite close to the tent.
“Turn out, guard !” bawls Faddy, and in
the rush left his rifle behind. I got caught
in the blanket somehow, but Jolly gave a
hand and disentangled me. Outside hurricane
lamps could be seen advancing from the
right, left and centre, and I began to think
that the battle had begun. Some time,
though, slipped aw r ay before we found the
sentry who had given the alarm, and a
little blasphemy relieved the tension.
Locating the man at last, our attention
was directed towards a dark clump . of
young gums into which “someone had just
crawled.” „ , .
Jolly suggested shooting first and investi-
gating after, but just then the officer-for-
the-dav came up, and wiser counsels pre-
vailed* We were to surround the gums and
take him alive. . . ~ ~
“A pretty ticklish proposition, said Mar-
ley, “I vote” _ .. .
“Silence!” hissed Dobbs, the officer, and
extend to the left. You cover the rear,
Faddy.” , ..
Cautiously stepping over the rocks, coils
of wire, biscuit and bulamacow-tins lying
around, we closed in on the gums with our
rifles at the ready. It was frightfully dark.
At ten paces Dobbs gave the order, and
we rushed. , , .. , , T
I don’t quite remember the details, but I
felt a terrible blow in the stomach, and, fall-
ing backwards, another on the head.
"When I came round again I wasn t feeling
too good, but seeing I was in the tent I
spoke to Jolly, who was sitting near me.
“Did we get him, Jolly?” ,
“No, Brown,” says Jolly, “we didttt get
him; but you got him—and pretty hard,
too **
I was some time getting the strength of
this, and it was too dark to see the faces
around me, so I asked, rather faintly, I
thought: _ tii w
“What was he, Jolly?
“A goat, my boy; a goat, says Jolly.
“■Mrs. Rudolph Kimple’s goat that got out
of the yard yesterday, you remember.
Just then Dobbs came in, and seeing me
sitting up exclaimed : “Ah, that s right
Brown. I thought he’d done for you. Feel
a bit sore, eh? Anyhow, no bones broken.
Never mind, Mrs. Kimple’ll hear all about
it to-morrow. I’ll draw her attention to the
regulations about stock, too —watch me if L
d °l wanted to say something (I don’t quite
know what), but before I could think of it
Week brought a bottle over and offered mo
a straight-un. This I negotiated in silence.
Then, seeing Dobbs go out, I asked for details.
Jolly acted as narrator, and in a brutal,
incisive way quickly disclosed the whole
I was still too confused to talk much, you
understand, but I was rather curious on one
point—the whereabouts of the goat.
“Oh, he’s being potted,” said Week, ana
we’re to have him for breakfast. Faddy shot
him stone-dead as he knocked you down.
“Yes; and a lucky thing for you, says
Faddy. “He would have butted again, sure.
When I heard this the intention to say
what was in my mind fell through, for of all
notorious shots Faddy’s the prize one.
Hadn’t I beaten him myself? I breathed
something resembling a prayer, and confess-
ing that my head was aching I lay down
and thought the matter over. Faddy told me
not to think about my watch —that he. would
put another chap on. I thanked him for
this, and soon after I fell asleep.
I must have slept for some hours, for it
was nearly dawn when I awoke, or, rather,
when I was awakened. The first thing I
was conscious of was that someone was pull-
ing at my head. Of course, I turned oyer
to see what was the matter, and something
bit my ear. I yelled out and woke the camp.
“There he goes!’ cried Hogan. “He’s got
your sandwiches, Brown!” and looking the
way he pointed I saw a village mongrel
making off with my breakfast.
I lost all sense of reason when I saw this,
and picking up my rifle (the first thing to
hand) I flung it at the impure beast, and the
thing went off. I slid down to reason again
with the bang, and Dobbs, who came running
up, demanded angrily to know the meaning
of this.
I appealed to Hogan, and showed Dobbs
my wounds, and after a lot of cross-examina-
tion my ear was taken as prima-fqcie evi-
dence against the dog, in my favor; but
Dobbs said he would have to report the
occurrence to the Commandant.
None of us got to sleep again after that,
as daylight intervened and the outpost
squads started to come in.
I was beginning to think of going home
(we were told in the eveninv that if the
nivht passed quietlv there would be no need
for further duty after 7 a.m.). and was con-
cocting an attack on the missus for foolishly
giving me sandwiches, when a galloping
horse was heard.
Questions flew around and we all pressed
forward. There in the quickening light
down the Gap road we saw a flying horse-
man. waving his hand aloft in a manner
pregnant with meaning.
Scorning the challenges of the guards he
dashed into the officers’ compound, and,
listening, we heard him pant:—
“Five —er —six—er—seven boatloads land-
ing on the beach! In the uncertain —light
I—er—couldn’t count ’em. Should say
there’s four —er —three —er —two hundred of
them.”
In a moment everything was as it. should
be. The outposts continued to pour in. We
numbered, roughly, a hundred and eighty, so
we had a chance —at least, so Faddv said.
The Commandant, the Headquarters
Officer and all the other officers, besides
Faddy, were soon on the spot. The Wireless

"Every Picture
Tells a Story."
Through all the tedious hours of a woman’s day the
.symptoms of disease are sometimes present.
And often women think it is their natural lot to suffer in
the way they do —that every woman’s duty is to struggle on —
to think only of her family and her housework —and that her
weakness is the penalty of sex.
This is the great mistake so many women make.
It is not natural, and it is not necessary that women
should be always ailing.
You may be ill and your kidneys the cause, for kidney
weakness soon destroys your health. Harmful waste and
poisons which the kidneys should remove are left in the system
to work havoc in the tissues, nerves and joints, causing
languor, dizziness, nervousness, backache, pain in the loins,
gravel, stone, dropsy, drowsiness, rheumatism and sciatica.
Never neglect weak kidneys. Give them the help they
need at the first sign of trouble. Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are solely for the kidneys, and if taken in time will
soothe and heal the delicate kidney membranes, and enable the
kidneys to resume activity and to rid the body of the poisons
which have caused so much distress.
A Sydney Woman Endorses Doan’s Pills.
Lasting: Cure of Eight Years.
Mrs. C. Hfrne, Boot. Store. 52 Abercrombie Street. City, says: “For years I
suffered from severe pains in my back and hips, caused through my kidneys being-
weak and disordered. Other symptoms were loss of appetite, sleepless nights, bad
headaches, and a dull, tired feeling which I could not get rid of. No one has any
idea how I suffered, and I was beginning to think life was a misery to me, but I am
thankful to say all that is changed now. I heard someone speaking very well of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so got a bottle to try them, and this wonderful
remedy soon drove the pain out of my back and restored my kidneys to a healthy
state. I now feel a different woman, and I am very grateful to Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills for my lasting cure. I have been perfectly well since these pills cured
me two years ago, and I have no fear of my ailment returning.”
Mrs. Horne confirms the above six years later: “I have had no trouble with my
kidneys since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills restored them to a healthy state eight
years ago. I need say no more, the facts speak for themselves.”

ECZEMA
A Lasting' Cure by
DOAN’S OINTMENT.
Mr. H. Watson, senior, 206 Australia Street. Cainperdown, Sydney, says- “A
couple of years ago I had eczema break out badly on my chest. It was shortly after
I returned from a trip to India, where 1 had gone with horses. I had lever very
badly in India, and the eczema seemed to be the result of this sickness. It was very
severe, and spread rapidly until I was in such a state that the pain and irritation
nearly drove me mad. A man I know advised me to get Doan’s Ointment saying
that he heard of excellent results from the use of this preparation I thought it a
good idea, and obtained a pot. The first few applications gave, me relief, and after
that I got along splendidly. Every time 1 applied the ointment there was a marked
improvement, and within a month I was cured, and not one trace of the adment
remained. Doan’s Ointment is a splendid preparation for eczema, and I recommend
it 'with eveij confidence to other sufferers. Its soothing and healing properties are
wonderful.”
Fouiteen years later Mr. Watson confirms the above: “It is now fourteen years
since Doan s Ointment cured me of eczema, and I am pleased to sav that the cure has
stood the test of time. lam still quite free of this dreadful comnlaint ”
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2/9 per pot, or
post free by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.
buzzed its news to the world that Uusivu
was attacked. The electric current was
switched on to the barbed-wire entangle-
ments ; cartridges and orders were served
out to the rank-and-file, and in the haste I
torgot my bleeding ear.
Said the H.Q.0.: “You, Faddy, with
twenty men, advance at the double and
occupy the highest point on the Gap road.
' lolong the engagement as much as possible
and give us a chance of finishing the
trenches. Remember, the first to reach the
highest point holds the position, and has the
other at his mercy. Double all the way!”
He turned and left us, asking for this and
tor that officer, while we stacked cartridges
into our shirt- and trousers-pockets.
, “Now, boys !” yells Faddy, “this way for
the Gap.”
I want to tell you that the Gap is half a
mile from the Wireless, and a steep road all
the way. And there are four hundred
ditches to get over before you are on the
road. I shall never forget those ditches,
(lou know that I chafe.) Into and out of
i hem we sprawled, dropping cartridges from
our shirt pockets as boys drop the “scent”
on a paper-chase. Faddy said lie would
cover the rear,’ and Hogan took the lead.
Commencing the ascent I found myself
nearly out of cartridges, and I stopped to
pick up a few that the coves in front were
dropping, panting to Faddy, who also
stopped (he wouldn’t desert me, he said),
that I’d only five left in iny pockets.
Up and up we went, panting and setting
<>ur teeth in our determination to beat the
enemy from the other side of the top.
Many things flashed through my mind
during that never-to-be-forgotten charge, but
most of them I can't recollect now. I know
I thought of the missus and promised her
that if I ever got out of it I’d forgive her for
giving me the sandwiches. I promised her
lots of other things, too, and was thinking
ot including a trip south, when Faddy’s
pants became words.
“Hogan! Hogan! For the Lord’s sake,
stop!”
He couldn’t go any farther without a
breather, and at that moment a German
could have shot me also with pleasure. I
was done. My heart and head were thump-
ing- like a gas-engine, the sweat was running
into my eyes and mouth, and when Hogan
stopped I could have crumpled up. We
stood gasping- for a moment, with our eyes
on the brow of the bill before us.
Then Hogan seemed to take charge.
“Jolly, Week and Brown, come on!
Spread out a bit, some of you, and give yer-
selves a show. That’s the ticket; now come
on ! Give ’em hell!”
We advanced more slowly, and when
within a few yards of the crest we crouched
down, our fingers on the triggers.
We were winning, Faddy said, when, ye
gods! half a dozen fields came into view
over the top. Wo took aim.
“Stop! Stop !” yelled Ilogan, who being
on the left a trifle forward had a second’s
earlier view.
“What the li—l, you withering hide-

“Hold ’em yourself,” said Jolly. “I’m
done. Here, Oi Mai," he cried, “gari lasc.”
(You come, you no fright.) “We think you
Germans. Where German he stop?”
“Me no savee, Master. We just come
along canoes along beach. We no see ’em
Germans. _ Altogether my people he come
make Christmas along JJusivu. Plenty more
man he come behind. You no shoot, Master.”
Sitting and lying- there in the road coaxing-
back our breath and swearing at the niggers
in between pants, we were a sorry sight. I
wanted to lie there forever, but to our com-
plete astonishment Faddy got a new lease of
life. _ Getting up fie ordered us to fall in.
After a bit, we fell in (not for the last
time either) and waited for his next.
“I want three volunteers to descend to the
beach with some of these natives and ascer-
tain the truth of the position.”
There was no response. We wore all
breathing very heavilv.
“Very well. I pick Jolly. Wees and
Grown to descend and reconnoitre.”
I groaned inwardly and outwardly, but all
to no purpose. I had to go, although I told
r addy about being chafed.
We were away about half an hour, and
when we got back Officer Dobbs had arrived
to bring us in.
“It’s all bunkum,” he said. “That damned
.scout mistook a lot of trading canoes for
ship’s boats!”

hen I got home the missus put me to
bed, and there I stayed with a swollen ear
and chafed legs until the next attack. I’d
tell you about that, too; but Jolly, AVeek
and Faddy, who didn’t come out of it too
wefl, have threatened, collectively, to punch
my head if I do.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JOE COCHRAN was a clerk with a firm
for which I mice labored. The firm
had alleged that there were “good
prospects ahead’'; but when I discovered
that Cochran had been there for five years
and was drawing the princely salary of
■JTs. (id. per week. I decided tl at the pros-
pects were too far ahead, and got out. It
was not for lack of trying that Cochran did
not get out also ; but the idea that the rent
in his ancient tie or the hole in his boot
was going to lose him each new job he
applied for probably, helped him to be un-
successful.
Cochran reckoned that if he could only
get a complete rig-out of clothes lie would
soon make good ; but his prospects -of doing
■it were absurdly small. He made strenuous
efforts to, as he termed it, “catch up to him-
self” ; he meant by that, save enough money
to buy the clothes he needed. For weeks he
would leave off smoking, walk a good part
of the distance to and from town, do without
lunch and strive by a score of little savings
to accumulate some money; then, suddenly,
he would Jose heart and dissipate at least "a
ue’w hat and a tie in the beer of oblivion.
I met him some time after I had
left the service of Scruthem & Co., and he
was still at the old address.
"I asked *Scru’ again for a rise,” he said,
'‘and the old beggar took the usual stand—
if I Could get more elsewhere I was at liberty
to go. The mean old hunk knows I’m a good
clerk, but lie knows, too, that I can’t afford
to leave him until I get something else, and
that it’s no help going for a new job and
admitting that you’re on 275. (id. a week.
Still, he has given me a rise—half a dollar
a week !”
“Better than nothing,” I said.
“Just about nothing,” he said bitterly, “be-
cause I went home and talked about it; and
next week my landlady told me * she was
keeping me at a loss, and intended charging
2s (id. more.”
When next we met Cochran was changed.
A good and expensive hat crowned him.
His tie announced that it was costly. His
linen was above criticism. He wore a suit
which was not only excellent in make, but
good in material, llis boots shone in patent-
leather glory, and he carried a stick which
informed all and sundry that it had not been
purchased because its oVvner had any use for
such a thing, but because he had merely
wished to display his purchasing power. As
a finishing touch, Cochran, when in answer
to his invitation I steered towards the three-
penny bar, led me to the higher-priced saloon
with an imperious manner indicative of a
lofty scorn of cheap refreshments.
“What’s the matter?” I inquired.
“I’ll tell you afterwards,” he said. “Mean-
time we’ll have another drink, and then you
will dine with me, and we’ll go along to 'the
theatre afterwards.”
I suppressed my curiosity and dined with
him luxuriously. It rather amused me to
notice that he insisted on attacking costly
details, not, apparently, because he liked
them, but simply because they were costly.
Several times during the dinner, and after-
wards during the intervals at the theatre,
he appeared to be about to tell me whence
his affluence; but it was not until we were
engaged upon supper that he let me have his
confidence.
“It’s a fine thing,” he said exultingl.v, “to
feel that you’re dressed properly and can
have what you want to eat and drink and
smoke, and needn’t worry. It makes you
feel a man—ready for anything.”
“How long have you been a millionaire?”
I asked.
He leaned over to me. /
“I’ve taken old Scruthem down.”
It was said triumphantly.
“How d’ye mean?” I said, slightly
startled.
lie did not directly answer my question.
“You know I’ve always been honest,” he
said. “Scrupulously honest. It's Scruthem
who’s been dishonest. lie systematically
underpaid me. I’ve seen all the things he
and others could have, and I wanted them,
and felt myself less than half a man because
I didn’t have them. I reckoned the old
vulture owed me money—and I took it.”
“But that means gaol for embezzlement,”
I whispered.
“I never even had a complete decent rig-
out of clothes,” he said eagerly. “! was a
thing of starved and thwarted desires, with
nothing but starved and thwarted desires
ahead of me.. I decided that if I could only
live—live, mind you—for a week, whatever
happened, it would be better to stand the
racket rather than go on for all my years
merely existing. So I saw my chance, and
got away with a hundred.”
“It means gaol.” I said, lamely.
“Of course!” he retorted with a laugh.
“But I’ll have had my satisfaction. I'll be
through the lot in a week; and directly it’s
gone down I go to Scruthem, tell him, and
let him know what I think of him.”
"I couldn’t do it without the clothes,” he
added; “but dressed like this and fed well
I'll stand up to him as man to man and let
him .do the worst.”
I gave him my. address before we parted
on the understanding that, when he was
arrested, he should send for me, and I
would do what I could for him. But weeks
went by and I did not hear. I searched the
papers for news, but found none. Then,
when I had partly forgotten him and partly
formed the conviction that he must have
changed his plans and got away, I met him'
again—prosperous-looking and fat. He ex-
plained things.
“I went down to see old Scruthem earlier
than I intended,” lie said. “He Wrote to
me. I had been away five days, and things
were getting in a mess because neither he
nor anyone else knew the run of my work.
When he saw how I was dressed—he had no
suspicion at all then —he thought I had
come into some money. He offered me half
a dollar rise to get me back. Then he
offered a dollar.”
, Cochran laughed mirthfully.
“I sailed into him for all he was worth.
You know what I told you about clothes.
It was right. They pulled me through. I
talked to him like a Dutch grandmother
and let him know the whole business.
The screw tried to use the threat of
punishment to get me back; but when I told
him I’d sooner go to gaol than return on
the old footing—that, as a matter of fact. I
had fully made up my mind to go in—it was
up against him. I hadn't known my own
value before; but he couldn’t afford to lose
me, so I resumed on something like a
salary. Since then,” he said, “I’ve never
looked back. I had confidence, and I could
assert myself.”
A young, seedy-looking man passed us as
we emerged on to the pavement, and Coch-
ran nodded to. him.
“That’s a clerk of mine,” he said. “A
darned useful young fellow he is, too.”
“Well, after your, experience, you ought
to know how to treat your clerks,” I ven-
tured.
A curious, hard, commercial look swept
the geniality from his face.
“A man’s only worth what he appraises
himself at,” he said shortly. “I give that
fellow thirty bob.”
Again he became genial.
“Better look me up at the office,” he said.
“There’s the latest address.”
I looked at the card he handed me. This
was it:r~
