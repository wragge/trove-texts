Dives and Magdalen.
If there is one subject out of the whole con-
ceivable range of subjects on which a man
might be expected to restrain his tendencies
to self-righteousness, and speak with, if not
a sense of shame, then, at least, a manly
regret, that subject is the female sacrificed
class which the police know as “prostitutes,”
and the so-called religious people as ‘ ‘ fallen
women.” The degradation of women comes
from the East. Other things come from
the Eist —pests, the product of lust or filth,
or of both, which hive decimated the
humanrace. Tyranny, unparalleled for cruelty
and petty malignancy ; that religious fanatic-
ism which all over the earth has made the
name of Goo, whether as Jehovah or Allah,
a curse worse than the pests ; these things,
too, come from the East. Whatever civili-
sation has grown in the East has ended in
the degradation of women. Whatever civil-
isation has undergone the Eastern influence
has done the same.
* * *
In the early days of every civilisation, women
have always had their place. Beside the
august figures of patriarchs, all over the
world are to be found the almost equally
august figures of their wives and daughters.
In every mythology —(and what is a mytho-
logy, but an idealised and exaggerated pic-
ture of the lives and desires of those who
made it?)—the goddess is the equal of the
god, and often surrounded with a superior
halo of age and sanctity. The mythology oi
Greece is the first among the civilisations of
the West, and in it this is completely the
case. Let us go further. Homer is the
record of our earliest actual civilisation, and
what shall we say of the Homeric women ?
Helen, Penelope, Circe, Calypso, Andro-
mache, are full complements to Achilles,
Odysseus, Agamemnon, Ajax, Patroclus,
In the same way, in the more legendary
treatment of all this by the Athenian drama-
tists, such figures as HSschylus’ Claitem-
nestra, as Sophocles’ Antigone, as Euri-
pides' Electra, need not fear comparison
with the Agamemnon, with the AEdipius,
with the Hippolvtus of the same writers.
* • »
But note. The influence of the East began
to make itself felt in Attica (as it never did,
■par parenthhe, in Sparta), and the degrada-
tion of women folio wed. At the very time
these poets wrote, the Athenian women had
been more or less consigned to seclusion.
What ensued ? Prostitution ; at first in the
more elevated form of hetairai or “friends,”
over which the name of Pericles’ Aspasia
has cast such a glamour ; and then in the
purely commercial form which has branded
Phryne and Thais with the name of “glori-
ous strumpet,” which Webster, the Eliza-
bethan dramatist, has bestowed on his
renowned Yittoria Corombona. “the white
Devil.” It was the same with Rome. The
degradation of women by making their rela-
tions with men partake of the nature of a
commercial transaction, wherein the women
were the goods and the men the purchasers
thereof, everywhere has ended in the same
way. Let us, however, pass by the Celtic
races—France, Spain, Italy—and turn to our
own Teutonic stock,
* * *
Here, just as elsewhere, the mythology
and early poetry bears unmistakeable evi-
dence of the dignity and equality of women
with men. Beside Woden and Thor comes
Freja (she is the goddess of Friday, “Freja's
day,” as Woden and Thor of Wednesday
m Thurada y). aad in that great collection
of Teutonic legend which we know by the
name of the Niebelungen Lied , or Song of the
Niebelungs (or elves), beside the supreme
figures of Sigurd and Siegfried stand
Gudruna and Brunhild. Tacitus, the
first historian of things Teutonic, notices the
freedom and equality of both men and
women in the daily life. The Britons were
Celts, and yet before i? X e Romans conquered
them, and before Christianity followed In
its train with its inevitable stigma of it
Eastern origin, as it were, in its tail, the
dignity and power of the British womer
still remains to us a reality in the name o
Boauioba. Then in turn the Britons were
conquered, and either exterminated or driven
into Wales, Cornwall, and Scotland by the
Saxons and Angles, who also in their turn
were slowly Christianised. The whole
genius, however, of the nation was so essen-
tially opposed to the degradation of women,
and the Onristianity with which they were
brought into contact was one so much more
influenced by the New Testament than by
the old—by the teaching of Jesus, who was
a Socialist and universal man, rather than
by that of Moses, who was an Eastern and
essentially a believer in priest-caste—all this
brought it about that the degradation of
women proceeded but slowly, and prostitu-
tion did not attain in England to the organi-
sation and general recognition which it did
in the Celtic nations of the Continent. Bat
with the Reformation things changed. The
Old Testament re-asserted its influence.
The Puritans modelled themselves on the
Jews, and on nothing did these fanatics pour
out the vials of their wrath, temporal and
spiritual, their punishments and disgrace,
and their denunciations of a future hell, with
more fervour than on sins of the flesh. Then
first this hateful phrase of “ fallen women ”
aroie. Then first the Puritan’s hatred of
secular power (except in his own hands)
found an equal hatred of sexual indulgence,
to bracket the two together, in company
with the incarnate principle of evil, in the
famous phrase “ the World, the Flesh, and
the Devil I ”
* * *
Thus the degradation of women, as a prin-
ciple and a system began. Women used to
be looked on as, at best, necessary evils.
Through Eve (accarding to the childish Eas-
tern fairy tale) had come “sin, and death,
and all our woe,” and therefore she was more
or less accursed and inferior. This is Milton’s
view, and Milton is the glory of the Puri-
tans, But, if the necessary woman, the
legal wife, was this, what has the religious
crank to say for the un-necessary woman,
:he “ unchaste ” woman, not to mention the
prostitute? Let history reply. The New
England statute, still extant, which forbade
a man to kiss his wife on the Sabbath, has
had its fellow in the persecution, the deliber-
ate thrusting down of every “ unchaste ”
girl for close on three centuries. Yes,
society, society dominated by the noisy dog-
matism of the religious fanatics, has, for
close on 300 years been doing its best to make
desperate every “ unchaste” girl, to turn her
into a professional prostitute, and then to
beat her down into a gutter, and keep her
there, till her wretchedness was over for
ever. Every form of religions infatuation
has persevered in this damnable part, and
perseveres. The rabid ascetic has joined
hands with the respectable mole whose com-
fortable home and early marriage, where
£ s. d. were “ no consideration,” have made
him so easily virtuous ; and in the same
alliance with these we have the hypocrites
of both classes, the human slave-dealers
who have satisfied their lusts easily and
cheaply in the present condition of things,
and are, therefore, naturally enough, utterly
opposed to any change.
• * *
We have considered this question of the
degradation of women historically. We
have seen how it has risen, how it continues.
Let us clinch our little historical study with
the concrete example from which it springs.
* * *
On the afternoon of last Saturday week
there took place an opening ceremony of the
Magdalen Refuge at Cook’s River, Sydney.
Roman Catholicism was represented by
Cardinal Moran ; the World and the Flesh,
by Lord Carington and a train of fashion-
able ladies and gentlemen. No one has any-
thing to say against such refuges. All de-
pends on the temper in which they are
carried on. Society sacrifices to its lusts and
conveniences a whole class of women. It
can at least spare them the mockery of the
unspeakable wrong that has been wrought
upon them. No real man , we repeat, would
have had the effrontery to make this an
occasion for the display of self-righteousness.
But the religious ascetic is not a man. Listen
to him :
“ Cardinal Moran, addressing the assemblage,
said The voice of charity appeals to you to-day
m behalf of the most unhappy of God’s creatures,
the most homeless and forlorn of outcasts, the
poor fallen, but repentant woman." ( Applause).
The key-note of the performance is struck !
The wretched man is going to gush out an
advertisement of the goodness and kindli-
ness of “charity!” That is all. Every-
thing else is subordinate to that, truth
included. How revolting! Listen, then,
once more to the stock religious gloating
and grovelling over the “ miserable
sinner ! ”
“Weighed down with miseries, the anguish of
her soul is intensified by the thought that the
home of her innocent childhood is for ever closed
against her. When her mind goes back to the
threshold of that cherished home she sees a father
whose grey hairs she had dishonoured, a mother
in whose heart a beloved daughter’s shame has
killed joy for ever, joyous friends, the playmates
of her youth, who now shudder at the mention of
her name.”
Now, anybody but a religious crank knows
quite well that the cause of nine out of ten of
our girls “ going wrong ”is j ust this—the mis-
ery of their homes, the meanness and tyranny,
temporal and spiritual, of a father whose
grey hairs, of a mother, whose gormandising
heart, bear on them, if anything does, the
stigma of untold wretchedness and sin. The
Australian prostitute class is fed by the class
of the seduced, and nine out of ten of these
girls succumb to the attraction of passion
from the disgust and despair of the weary
and dreary Australian middle-class home life.
* • *
To proceed. Who, again, except a re-
ligious crank, would talk that old ante-
diluvian rot about the “intoxication of
guilty delight ” of the life of the prostitute ?
It is quite too thin, all that ! The life of the
prostitute is a wretched life, and its excess
is the result, once more, of its disgust and
despair. A simple statement of whab a
prostitute has to go through any week would
perhaps cure even a religious crank of his
ideas of “ the roses and raptures ” of the
vice of the streets.
* * *
This is all Cardinal Moran had to say
(excepting greasy self-righteous congratula-
tion), and he said it over andoveragain, seem-
ingly with a lingering gusto over the pictures
of “ the life of excitement which they ” (the
prostitutes) “ have made,” their “ passions
so violent and unrestrained,” and the rest,
natural enough to the religious ascetic.
Imagine Jesus talking like this to Magdalen
(who gives her very name to the perform-
ance), or to any other of those “sinners”
with whom it was His reproach that He
“consorted!” Think of His speech to the
woman taken in adultery ! But, then, Jesus
had nob to make His terms with “society,”
but was its bitter foe to the bitter end.
That makes all the difference I
* - *
For shame’s sake, for the sake of manli-
ness and common honesty, the man who
presided ” over all this had to say some-
thing, by way of qualification or protest,
lest the whole affair should seem a “ put-up
job ”in behalf of religious “ charity 1 ” Let
us forget the irony of the fate which placed
Lord Oaejngton in the position of presiding
over the opening of such an institution-let
us forget a lot of things in considering the
fact that from his lips fell the only support-
able words spoken on this unsupportable oc-
casion :
... CL, a h our charities, this one, I venture to
think, is the one most closely connected with our
common Christianity, and it is to my mind a
touching and beautiful sight to see the hand cf
fellowship and kindness held out to our poor
sisters, who, in many cases, have been more
sinned against than sinning. It is not very hard
for those who are in easy circumstances to keep
straight before the world. You all remember—
all who have read Thackeray at all events-that
Becky Sharp thought that she could have been
a good woman on £5OOO a year, and we should
never sit in judgment and forget the troubles and
temptations of the very poor.”
This is right so far as it goes, and, though it
does not go very far—indeed, though it goes
but a very little way—it is pleasant to think
that the right key- tone to all this, the right
temper in which it should be approached,
though touched and notified so late and with
so uncertain a finger, yet was touched, was
notified.
Quis Custodiet Custodes? The
Political Patriot’s Reward.
When Melv ille, in admitting that he
had received £25 for assisting certain business
through some N.S. Wales Government department,
excused the act by saying “ A member of Parlia-
ment must live,” a virtuously indignant Press ve-
hemently and Johnsonianly denied the necessity.
A howl of scornful denunciation rewarded his
candour; he was upbraided for covetousness,
condemned for his want of patriotism, and a pious
protest was raised against such demoralisation of
politics. His sin is long past, but is neither for-
gotten nor forgiven. Certain writers still affect a
haughty contempt for him on account of this well-
remembered and oft-quoted transgression. But
Melville is not without imitators in the New
South Wales Parliament. The Attorney-General
hastens to emulate and exceed the Melville
offence. Mr. Wise j oinsin the plea that “Members
must live, and in his case the necessity prompts
him to take a 60-guinea brief from one of the
subordinate officers in his Department. For that
sum he undertakes to conduct a case, not for an
unfortunate constituent who has sold some land
to the Government, but for the Government itself
of which he himself is a member. And the fact
of his being a Minister robs the plea, which Mr.
Wise borrows from Melville, of all its force!
The Attorney-General already gets £l5OO a year
from the State, but this sum does not satisfy him,
even with the income derived from the practice of
his profession added; ho must dip his hands
deeper yet into the public revenue by ac-
cepting fees which, in all human probability,
he could not have obtained had it not
been for his Ministerial position. “ Members
must live," was Melville's apology; “Min-
isters must live in princely affluence ” is
the revised version of Mr. Wise. Needless to
note that the Press applauds in the “ Freetrade
Grinner” the strongly developed tendency shown
in its incipient stage by the Protectionist sinner.
Mr. Wise is member of a Ministry which must be
kept in office, not on account of any alleged merit
of its own, but because of the alleged demerits of
the Opposition. Freetrade must be supported at
the cost of the public purse : at the cost even of
p ilitioal repute. As in the name of religion hein-
ous crimes have been wrought, so for the sake of
Freetrade must shameless political abuses be sup-
ported.
* * *
It is said that on legal grounds the Attorney-
General’s action can be justified. A barrister’s
acceptance of a retainer is not, it is said, an
“ agreement ” within the letter of "
of the N.S.W, Constitution Act. This Jtl f 6^ 011
quibble that a police-court lawyer
was a sneak-thief and whose tl o was Client

such an agreement to appear, his loss K
would be more than the loss of the doing
of that agreement. A first-rate man may n^/ 00

And further, Mr. Wise attempts to strengthen
his position by an ad misericordiam appeal “ Tho

is the substance of his pathetic appeal. £3l nn n
year, with patronage and perks, is Mr. Wisp's
estimate of the annual worth of Mr. Wise’s nhiiV
ties. We doubt whether the South Sydney elec
tors would rate him so highly as that, but even so
there is nothing in this mean apology for an ex ’
A U if • E3 !? g a Miniater not prevent the
Attorney-General from attending to his private
practice. He is now better advertised than ever
in his life before, and his Ministerial duties do not
prevent him from appearing for ordinary clients.
Even though his salary as a Minister is only £l5OO
a year, the profits of his private professional prac-
tme added thereto bring his income to a figure
which it is not likely ever to have approached
before. Then why should he be allowed to add to
a sum which he could not earn, if patriotism did
not induce him to sacrifice himself on the Sybaritic
altar of Ministerial position ? And his allusion to
the former emoluments of his position lis unfor-
tunate, inasmuch as it recalls the remembrance of
his predecessors in office. He is the successor of
W. B. Dalley, of Sir James Martin, and of
Edward Butler ; they were men of surprising
ability and attainments, besides which those of
the ‘ Freetrade Grinner” are insignificant and in-
comparable. He is merely a perky youth of some
four or five years’ standing at the Bar ; the
Hobson s choice ’ of a Premier who offered him
a portfolio because no one else could be found to
succeed the tricked and deluded Foster ; £3OOO
is nearly double the amount which the Premier
himself receives ; is Mr. Wise so far superior to
Sir Henry Parkes ? W e would smile.
* * *
The most serious outcome of the whole affair is
the comprehensive opening which it makes pos-
sible for all manner of corruption. This result
was clearly not contemplated by Mr. Wise, bub it
is very real nevertheless. Every barrister in the
House can in the future be made a grateful pen*
sioner of the State. As the Attorney-General can
take briefs from the Government, such briefs can
also be given as a reward to any other barrister in
the House. And not here does the evil end. If
a barrister can accept emolument from the
Crown, so likewise can a surveyor, a doctor,
or any other professional man. This opens
up a wide vista of corruption in the
hereafter when the colony shall cease per-
chance to be blessed with “ commercial free-
dom and honest Government," Every member
can then be exposed to the temptation of a bribe
in the form of a fee. So careful have previous
Parliaments been in this matter, that no member
of either House sitting on a Select Committee has
been permitted to accept the fee paid to commit-
tee-men who were not M.’sP. Such service by a
member was voluntarily and gratuitously ren-
dered. But henceforth there is not the slightest
reason why these fees should not be paid—espe-
cially to supporters of the ruling faction. Mr.
Wise can prove that such payment would not
evidence “ an agreement ” within the 28th section,
and therefore no liability can attach. In view of
these things, it seems an absurd waste of energy
to pass in New South Wales a Payment of Mem-
bers Bill; if members can pay themselves, dlu
Wise, there is really no need that the colony
should pay them any regular salary. And the
honorarium method of the Attorney-General
would —under a less scrupulous Cabinet—have
the advantage that those members wuild be best
paid who best served the Government of the day,
while wicked and obstructive Oppositionists would
be starved into meek and useful submissivenessi
And by such means a working majority for the
Government could easily be obtained; in the
English Commons each member represents merely
1 660th of the voting strength of the House, but in
New South Wa ? es each member is nearly
times as important, being l-124th of the Assembly s
strength. To secure a majority then it would he
necessary to bribe only one-sixth as many persons
as in England.
* # *
These are considerations which probably have
not yet presented themselves to Mr. Wise, He
I- a young man whose mental breadth is never
likely to be charged as a sin against him. A little
too much prosperity has perverted and dethrone®
such reflective powers as h 6 is said to possess. He
can only contemplate one theme—the surpassing
worth of B. R. Wise; he seemingly can only see one
object—the personal welfare of that same youth*
therefore when a chance of adding some easy
hundreds to his present large revenues presente
itself, he just went for those hundreds withou
apparently giving a thought to the political evi
certain to result. Evil to the country, for corruF
tion has been relieved of an efficient curb; oyu
himself, for a greedy,[grasping, grabbing politic**
is certain to have a sudden termination to a
career as soon as his covetousness is revealed a®
discovered.

I.—lts Origin.
In the early months of 1886 one J. H. Nathan sat
in Ms office. No. 32 Sydney Arcade. He was, so
far as we can make out, the leading spirit of the
“Australian Financial Company,” and from
aught that is known to the contrary comported
himself with the dignity worthy of so
responsible and enviable a position. Critical
men might think No. 32 Sydney Arcade too
small to hold so large a concern ; but it held J. H.
Nathan, and he was most of the “ Australian
Financial Company.” He may have been a hope-
ful, even sanguine man, but while bearing, appar
ently upon his own shoulders, the weight of so
magnificent an enterprise, lie can hardly have
anticipated the gorgeous future outcome of his
phenomenal energy. But as fortune always
favours the brave so success ever rewards the
energetic. Mr. Nathan’s commercial capabilities
did not escape the eyes of his peers in the art of
money-making. There came a time when others
demanded a share in the income of the “ Austra
llan Financial Company,” and this share Mr.
Nathan gladly gave—for a sufficient consideration,
as hereinafter stated.
2. —Its History.
On or about the 23th June, 1886, certain gentle-
men instructed a Sydney solicitor to draw up an
agreement. By this agreement Mr. J. H.
Nathan ceased to be the controlling mag-
nate of the “Australian Financial Company.’’
He divested himself of his incorporated glory,
and subsided into private life, taking with
him as a consideration for hia descent 10,000 fully-
paid-up shares in the “Australian Loan, Dis-
count, and Financial Company,” which rose
butter (ly-like from the chrysalis of the “Austra-
lian Financial Company,” There is a careless
truthfulness about this agreement (registered with
the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, Sydney,
and visible to anyone who holds a shilling), which
must commend it to unprejudiced perusers.
Therein the “promotors” (a Dictionary does not
seem to have been held by the parties) assert that
the “Australian Financial Company” has been
in existence for sometime, and that “the gross
profits— 1 gross ’ is here a good word—in every in-
stance have never been less than thirty pounds per
centum, and, in some instances, as in cases of
Bills of Sale, at, and even exceeding one hundred
pounds per centum per annum ” —a high testi-
mony, as our italics must show, to the business
capacity of Mr. J. H. Nathan and anyone
who may have helped him to conduct the
operations of the “ Australian Financial
Company.” In the light of this gorgeous
fact, it is no wonder that the “promoters” of
the “Australian Loan, Discount, and Financial
Company ” decided to take over the “ Australian
Financial Company ” at the extraordinarily cheap
figure of 10,000 paid-up shares in the new
concern. It was, indeed, a wondrous bargain
at the price, and the only matter for marvel in the
transaction is that the Australian Financial Com-
pany allowed Mr. Nathan, or rather, that Mr.
Nathan allowed the 30-to-100-per shent Australian
Financial Company to go for so seemingly inade-
quate a price. Oi the same date—the fateful
89th of June, 1886 —the Articles of Association
under 37 Vic. No. 19, seem to have been drawn
up, with the list of shareholders attached. In
this list, as filed with the Registrar, the name of
the Hon. Francis Abigail, Minister of Mines, who
latterly seems—from the prominence given to his
illustrious name in the concern’s newspaper-ard-
other advertisements —to have become grandmas-
ter of the business, does not appear among the array
of shareholders ; but on the of page 9, and
near rule 61 he is stated, on the authority of
the company s then secretary, to be a “ Provincial
Director.” In the printed Articles of Association
of the Australian Loan, Discount, and Finarc at
Company, as issued to our representative, it ap-
pears from article 61 that Messrs. John Ktdd,
M.P., and Francis Abigail, M P., were both
“Provincial (sic) Directors ” of the A L D aid
F. Co. The wisdom of getting two “members” or
the “ Provincial ” directorate will be at once ao-
parent; members of the ’Case being acquainted
with each other, these two would certainly be able
bo do a large, if not a profitable, business among
their fellow-legislators. A good high-class pawn-
shop is the most pressing necessity of the N S. W.
Parliament at the present time Tuerefoi e, itisevi
dent that Messrs. Abigail and Kidd bad Urge op-
portunities—far be it from us, however, to insinu-
ate that they availed themselves thereof—of in-
creasing the business.o f the office wh'ch they were
appointed to direct But this is a diversion from
a purely historical view of the “ Australian
Banking Company, Limited ” We digressed
where the “Australian Loan, Discount and
Financial Company”—we just revel in these
names, they arc so comprehensive and magnifi-
cent—registered itself under the Act 37, v )O .. No.
19, From the directors’ report, dated the 30th
July, 1877, there seems to have been a cessation
of business immediately after registration of the
‘Australian Loan, Discount and Financial Com-
pany,” for it is therein stated that —
“ The present premises of the company were firsb occupied
on the 17th October, 1886, hut it was not until the 9th day ot
January that operations actually c >minenoed, since whi-h
date the gro’s transactions of fu- company have amounted
to the considerable sum of £181,893 3j. Hi."
Naturally the gigantic success of the company
—£2597 having been returned as “ net profit
stimulated the directors to propose an extension
of the business. Tneir suggestions to this end
were several. one, contained in the fourteenth
Paragraph of their report, was to the effect that
“ any balance of the company’s stock should be
placed on the market.” The nominal capital of
the company was £lOO,OOO, and as. according to
the directors’ report, £Bll was sufficient to pay a
half-year’s dividend at the rate of 12j per cent
per annum, it would seem that only about £l3 000
of that capital was liable for such dividend. The
suggestion in paragraph 14, iherefore, would seem
bo be ample for the ito media'e prospects of the in-
stitution. Nor did their pvoSoionc j and t ethought
stop at this point ; they further appear to have
expressed themselves as follows—the passage is so
beauteous that we quote it
“ We would also strongly urge that an alteration should
be made in the name and capital of the company. There
seems to be a very strong objection, both (sic.) amongst de-
positors, customers, and many shareholders to any word ap-
proaching ‘ loan.’ We would suggest that the name of the
Company be altered to ‘ the Australian Banking Company
(Limited),’ and that the nominal capital be increased to
£500,000.’’
The Directors evidently looked for a wider
extension of business than the paltry £BO,OOO
or so of uncalled capital in the A.L.D.
F. Coy. would suffice to provide for.
£480,900 was, it would seem, very much
nearer the mark, therefore the shareholders (as it
appears from a printed sheet kindly handed to ns
over the “bank's” well-polished counter by a
much-whiskered official, and purporting to be the
“Minutes of the Annual General Meeting” of
July, ’B7) on the motion, as it is stated, of Mr.
Troup, seconded by Mr. Ferguson, and supported
by Mr. Lines and Mr. Ellery, agreed to this exten-
sion of the Company’s nominal capital. And
further, out of respect to the “very strong objec-
tion, both amongst depositors, customers, and
many shareholders,” the meeting farther decided
to change the name of their institution by eliminat-
ing “ any word approaching ‘ loan,’ ” and thence-
forth the concern sailed under the most re-
spectable and patriotic name of the “Aus-
tralian Banking Company (Limited).” These
minutes contain ihe latest published official record
of the history of the Cjmpany. Following upon
the motion changing the title, the minutes contain
an account of the election of Directors, from which
it appears that for the two vacancies on the board
three gentlemen were nominated as Candida' e»,
viz , the Hon. Francis Abigail, M.P., Mr. John F.
Martin, and Mr. Sydney Burdekln, M P., who,
as the world well knows, is a capitalist reputed to
be a millionaire, and forms one of the Parkes
party in the N.S.W. Legislative Assembly. The
latter was not one of the chosen—in this connec-
tion Chosen is an excellent word —Messrs. Abigail
and Martin being the selection of the members pre-
sent. Then a vote of thanks to the Directors and
staff was passed, and it is farther allegedinthe re-
markable official document now under review that

quired and long-feltnecessity." What the italicised
words mean we are unable to guess in twice, but
they are doubtless pregnant with deep signific-
ance. Mr. Hurley next asserted (according to
the same minutes) that he con'd safely affirm to
tbe shareholders rha‘, “fr'mthe knowledge he
had acquired of the Company s operations the
future dividends would be such as to some-
what surprise them." We cordially endorse this
statement. From the knowledge which we have
recently acqni ei of one or two of tbe Company’s
operations we are prepared to believe that a whole
lot of persons beside tbe shareholders will be sur-
prist d. A vote of thanks to the chairman and
his suitable response thereto smarted the Company
fairly along the extremely profitable path, along
wh’ch it, is, according to advertisements in the
Sydney daily press, now trending.
3. —lts Objects.
These may best be gathered from the published
papers of the institution. In a general way, of
course, it was created to occupy the vacuum re-
presented by ‘ the publicly-required and long-
felt necessity,” and its particular objects are
manifold. Thus, in an advertisement In the T.
and C. Journal of the loth October, 1887, pur-
porting to bo the advertisement of the Company, j
the public are informed that, “It is essentially a
Bank foe ihepeople,”—chiefly the hard-up People,
we presume—and that, “ I'he business of this
Rank, though differing in some respects from the
operations of iha chartered Banks, is of a much
safer and more profitable character." The words
we have italicised are noteworthy. The “char- j
tered Banka” will be gratified to leatn on such
high authority that their business differs, even if j
only “in some respects,” from that of the Aus-
tralian Banking Company. Limited ; and they will
farther bedeeplyinte rested to discoverthe natureof
this “much safer and more profitable” business.
As it is “ a Bank for the People,” the names of
Francis Abigail and John Hurley, M’s.P., and per-
petnal patrons of the people, are well placed at
the head of wftat the ad., with quaint, but under
the circumstances, not incomprehensible disregard
for the Queen’s English, calls the “ Directory.”
Another paragraph of the advertisement states,
that ‘ The method adopted in makiog advances is
upon a 10 per cent per annum Interest basis,
together with a sliding scale of commission upon
each transaction according to its nature." That
this basis has not been strictly adhered to (except
so far as the sliding, upwards, is concerned) is
vouched for as a fact by some of the customers of
this bank, who have confided to us the story of
their connection with the institution.
I.—lts Operations,
To here detail many facts and figures regarding
the operations of the Australian Banking Company
would be manifestly imprudent. The risk of
making an unimportant error in the statement is
sufficient to prevent any attempt in this direction.
We will, therefore, merely take one of the trans-
actions within our knowledge; that one alone
should be a sufficient warning to the public. On
or about the 15th March, 1887, a respectable and
diligent tradesman in one of the suburbs applied
to what was then the Australian Loan, Discount,
and Financial Company for a loan cf £lO for six
months, offering as security chattel property
valued at about £l5. The loan was granted. The
interest was to be £3 for the half-year, an d repayment
was to be male at the rate of ss. par week during
that term, and the remainder when the term
ended. He seems to have been fairly regular
with his instalments, as will be seen from the
photograph of his pass-book herewith; he paid up
£0 10s. during the term, and then owed £3 10s.
balance of the loan not cleared by instal-
ments, and £3 agreed upon as interest, but,
as will be u iticed by the last entry, it took not
£6 10a, but £8 17s. 61. to clear his little account
on the 20th September. Whe her the extra
£2 7s. 61. was “ commission on a sliding scale ”
alluded to in the advertisement, or whether in was
as he affirms demanded on account of solicitors’,
valuation, and registration fees, and cost of pass-
book ic is unnecessary to enquire. The mere fact
that he hal to pay such an amount proves the
assertion before quoted that the business of this
bank is “ of a much safer and more profitable
character ” than that of the Chartered Banks.
Our informant asserts that this extra £2 7s. 6d.
was a compromise made on account of a
larger claim, but of this we have now no sufficient
documentary evidence. Taking the transaction
as it stands, it reveals an apparent imposition.
£3 interest on £lO for six months is, as any school-
boy knows, sixty per cent, per annum, so that this
transaction hardly seems to stand on the boasted
10 per sbent basis. But as the borrower paid
back ss. per week there would only bo an average
amount of £6 15s. owing during the term ; £3
interest on £6 15 1. for s’x months approximates
00 per cent.—a very fair sum considering tnat the
bank is publicly said by flaring and uncontra-
dieted advertisements in the newspapers to have
“ the Hon. Francis Abigail, Minister of Mines,”
and Mr. John Hurley, M.Ti.A. for the Lithgow
miners, at the head of its directorate, and is al-:o
said to be essentially a “ Bank for the People.”
Loaded with this huge burden of interest the
client might well have been excused from further
payments. That such was not the case we have
already shown. The fees charged amounted to
23 per cent, and the interest to 90 per cent, per
annum of the loan ; he paid £5 7a 6d., or
say one hundred and thirteen per cent. , for the
loan of an average sum of £6 15?. for S'x months ?
“ More fool he ! ” will be the popular commenr,
but what was the “ gullible dolt” to do? If he had
not paid what this high-toned Bank chose to
exact from him he would have been deprived of
his means of livelihood. When once needy men
are attracted into such bargains, they become im-
potent to do aught but obey their 60 per cent,
taskmasters. And, in the present ca?e, the names
of such “ friends of the people ” as Messrs. Abigail
and Hurley at the head of the prospectus, are
sufficient to allure men into financial pitfalls from
which escape is often hopeless. It will be
noticed that this transaction was begun with the
Australian Loan, Discount, and Financial Com-
pany, but concluded under the auspices of the
Australian Banking Company. The stamp placed
over the final entry is that of the latter institution.
I To prove that the Bank, when changing its name,
did not also change its principles, we need only
refer to the prospectus now being issued to intend-
ing shareholders, and advertised also in the T.
and C. Journal, o£ the 15 oh insL, page 788. The
prospectus states clea-ly that, “ Notwithstanding
the change in capital, the operations and trans-
actions of the Bank will still be conducted upon
precisely the same principles as heretofore,” See.,
&c. It was the same loan-office all the time,
although in deference to the tender susceptibili-
ties of some of its “respectable” supporters, it
cut away from the title any implied reference to
the golden-ball industry on the 28th July last.
5. — Its Directorate.
In the array of high-toned gentlemen and poli-
ticians alleged to have accepted the positions of
Directors, this much-named Company has ever
been glorious. Among the "Provincial {sic)
Directors,” according- to the printed Articles of
Associa i n of the A. L. D. and F. Company, there
are the names of John Kidd, M.P., and Francis
Abigai l , M.P. ; J. F. Martin, Esq., M. B.
Inst., C.B. ; G. B. Thomas, Esq., solicitor;
P. J. Earreli, and J. H. Nathan, B squires,
merchants; 11. P. Falser, Esq., merchant; A.
Murray, Esq., tea merchant, and many other
personages of high commercial and other renown.
The first five working directors are stated to have
been Messrs. Farrell, H. C. Roberts, Nathan, Mur-
ray, and Mathey, and to these, as it would appear,
were subsequently added Messrs. John Hurley,
M.P. (the Lithgow miners’ friend), and C. S.
Gillett. It is just possible that some of these
names may have been inserted without sufficient
authority, but being inserted the concern just had
to boom. Fancy a bank having 15 “ Provincial
Directors,” not one of them of less rank than Esq,,
not doing well! It had to go, and apparently it
did. Now its “Directory” is alleged, in the
newspaper advertisements, to include the Hon.
Francis Abigail, M.P., Minister for Mines ; John
Hurley, M.P., and Messrs. J. F. Martin A
Mathey, John Vann, J. H. Nathan, and John
Scott—Esquires, all of them. Each of these
gentlemen, according to the Articles, must be the
holder of not less than 500 shares, and must have
been registered as the holder of not less than 20
for at least three months prior to his election.
Friends of that gifted man, the Honorable Francis
Abigail, Minister of Mines, will rejoice to know
that, in accordance with this article, he must
have at least a £5OO slice in this profitable con-
cern ; it is consoling to think that even if deprived
of Ministerial position he could still profitably
officiate as the poor man’s three-ball friend by
virtue of his advertised position in this institu-
tion. And the fact that he is stated to be a
Director encourages the thought that the Parkes
Cabinet was well chosen. If it contains one man,
Parkes, to wit, who knows how to borrow, it also
contains one man, Francis Abigail, who, from his
assured experience as a “bank” director should
know well how to lend—on a aixty-per-shenL-
and-sliding-scale-of-commish basis. The Parkes
Ministry started existence under “1.0. U."
auspices ; it threatens to fall within the shadow
of the three golden balls. It may be that the
Honorable Francis Abigail, Minister of Mines
is really not so much mixed up with the affairs of
the Australian Banking Company as advertise-
ments would seem to indicate, It may be that
though his name heads the list of D v o :cors in the
newspapers he is utterly unaware cl ,ue well-pub-
lished fact, and that he knows nothing of the
marvellous rapidity with which interest accumu-
lates on loans made by the stout heartedly philan-
thropic institution which claims him as one of its
bosses. Hut if these things really are so, if he
really is innocent of the nature of the business he
is supposed to overlook, ho ought to make that
fact public by renouncing the fame
awarded to him, taking libel actions against
those who have fraudulently used his
name, and liberally compensating all who
have been lured into a usury trap by the
glitter of the venerated cognomen of the
illustrious Parkes’ colleague. Plenty of
ignorant people, on reading the advertise-
ment, would take their horses and carts to
Ihe A.B. Co. right away and expect to find
Abigail in a stall ready to lend at least
twopence more on each article than any
other person, who was not a friend of
the people, would be willing to advance.
6.—lts Literature
Vi o are justified In giving a separate
heading to this subject, for the institution
has a literature, thank Heaven, peculiarly
its own. A. literature that tolerates in a
Directors’ Report five paragraphs out of
twenty beginning with “We will now,"
an expression which seems to have been
borrowed from some place where they use
the No. 4 collection hymn-book ; a litera
lure which permits directors to declare
that they have been comparatively unable
to do something; a literature that calls a
directcrate” a “directory,” and charges
the accurate Harley with talking about a
‘‘publicly required and long-felt neces-
sity a literature which regards “an ad-
denda as a correct phrase. Other eccen-
tricities of similar character we cannot
spare lime to notice, but if there be any
Australian citizen who is making a collec-
tion cf literary bulla and eccentricities wo
can confidently recommend for his perusal
the advertisements and reports of the
Australian, Banking Company, Limited.
7.—lts Critics.
Without observation or comment wo
present as the opinion of one critic the fol-
lowing extract from the Australian Bank-
ing and Insurance Record of the 16th
August laff The paragraph found page 472
of l hat paper is as follows :
"We have received the balance-sheet, directors' report, and
minutes of proceedings at the annual general meeting (held
at Sydney on 28sh July) of the Australian Loan, Discount,
and Financial Company, Limited, Sydney. The accounts,
which will be found on another page, are of so extraordinary
a character that we consider it our duty to call attention to
them. First dealing with the balance-sheet as it is given to
the world, we find —Liabilities: Paid-un capital, £20,096;
fixed deposits, £8798; gross income, £2597; total, £31,492.
Assets: Investment's £18,303 :seoured overdraft*, £1971;
bills discounted, &c.,£‘!575; suspense account, £3; formation
expenses account, £1299; furniture, brokerage, advertising,
Xc, £2259; salaries, assurance, tbe. , £984; Bank balances,
£56; c ,sh in hand, £2041; assets balance liabilities. There
is no profit and loss aejou ,t. The whole of the gross in-
come, as it is called iu the balance-sheet, is treated as “ a
net profit of £2597 10s 10i." in the directors' report, and is
distributed as follows; Carried to reserve fund, £1000;
carried to furniture and formation expenses account, £500;
dividend to shareholders at the rate of 121 per cent, per
annum. £811; bonus to depositors of twelve months (2 per
cent.), £118; bonus to dr positora of six months (1 per cent.),
£3O; cirriea forward, £l3B, We will reconstruct the ac-
counts b iefly as follows .

The company's affairs are thus nearly £2OOO to the bad, and
yet t've management dig tributes nearly £2BOO, giving the
shareholders a divide d, and the depositors a, bonus. The
accounts are duly audited, b it it appears to us that, as a
professional matter, auditors should rt flsct before passing a
balance-sheet in the form adopted by this company. Such a
balance-sheet is always liable to abuse. At the same time
the audito-s are not responsible for the directors calling the
“gross income" a “ net profit" (which further on in the
report is stated to be an item “ actually paid and received
cash results," whatever that may mean, “ not the same as is
usual with building societies ”). So elated is the manage-
ment at its “ cash results," that it has obtained the sanction
of the shareholders to the style being altered to “ The Aus-
tralian Banking Company (Limited)" and to the nominal
capital being increased to £500,000. The directors state
their couvictio r that their proposals being accepted, “ the
company's stock would immediately he at a considerable
premium." Investors sometimes do extraordina-y things,
but can any be found in Sydney to pay a premium for
shares in a company which treats its gross income as net
profit?’
B.—Miscellaneous.
As every day is advancing the cause of
woman suffrage we are pleased to note that
the Australian Banking Company accords the
fair fex an authority too • often denied it
elsiwhce. No less than four matrons are said to
have been present at the meeting of the gffih
July, an 1, although they do to have
taken the floor on any occasion, wo do not doubt


[SirHENftY Parses, having b.en informed that his seat
was to ha challenged by resolution, has resigned, with a view
to enabling hi road-and-bridge oonstpuency, St Leonards, i o
ratify his proceedings But it will be widely held that the
i sues involved, which not only affect Parkes but his
colleagues and the whole Parliament and Parliarrcn'ary
system of the country are of far too momentous a character
to be decided off-hand in a hole-and-corner way by a
“rushed" election. The question at issue is not so much
whether Parkes shall be a member of Parliament as
whether ho shall be Premier, and whether he and his Minis-
terial associates are fit to wield Governmental power ]

but that their presence was felt. A clergyman,
the Rev. A. M’Clinchle, is also said in the
printed report to have been there, whether oc-
cupied in a promising search for the Lost
Ten Tribes or not does not distinctly appear. It
Is idle to speculate on such themes. There is one
thing in connection with the Company’s trans-
actions which we have not hitherto noticed. It
is the code of rules regulating repayments,' &c.
The rules are printed in the book of which we
have photographed two pages, and they seem to
be just about as stiff as the interest charged in
some cases. Thus, if a borrower omits to pay an
instalment on its due date, he is, by Rule 1, made
subject to a fine of one penny per week percent,
per weak, or £420 per cent, per annum) for every
shilling left unpaid F the borrower gets one week
in arrears, he will be written to and charged one
shilling for each letter—another proof of the safe
and profitable character of the business conducted
by the A. L. D. aad F. Company when these rules
were framed, and continued by the Australian
Banking Company. Each borrower is to be fur
niched with a pass-book (cost, one shilling), and if
he 10.-es it another pass-book will ba given to him
in exchange for another shilling. BVory bor-
rower changing his place of abode must give
no ice thereof to the manager within one week,
or else forfeit one shilling.
* * *
Such are some of the notable features of the
Australian Banking Company. And such are its
directors. Contrasting the business transacted
with the position of some of the men said to ba
responsible for its control, it will be admitted that
one or the other ought to be changed. Mr. B R.
Wise is amending the Insolvency laws —will the
Hon. Francis Abigail, Minister of Mines, under-
take to amend the laws relating to Banks of
Deposit ?
Parkesiana.
Premier Parkes’s speech, in reply to M’Elhone,
was a remarkaole performance. It disarmed the
Opposition for the time, at least, and if it did not
carry the House with him, it obtained f-r him
a large amount of sympathy. No one knows
better than he how to play upon the weak feelings
of his audience, when to provoke a laugh, or
when to drop a tear. Nothing in its way could
be more suggestive of the dying gladiator than
his reference t) his King LEAR-like position:
“As for me, it matters little. I am poor ; I am
old ; I stand, as it were, in the light of the grave.
I use the word advisedly, for I would rather die
to-night than live to morrow, if I could so choose.
Nothing is now more attractive to me the
repose of the grave ; it cannot long be far off/’ At
the same time it is perfectly certain that “ the
re pose of the grave ” is not by any means the one
thing that Sir Henry sighs for, and that he could
casi'y have mentioned a good many other things
which would be much more attractive to him
than a funeral procession—even to his own Dead-
house. #
The real hollowness of his position was pain-
fully evident when he attempted to defend his
appointments to the Upper House. “In every
batch of appointments for which I am responsible
there have been men representing different shades
of opinion ; but while I hold that doctrine, am I
lo exclude the appointment of a worthy man,
rr orely because he has had some monetary rela-
tions with me ? And because he is appointed, is
I he infamous conclusion to be drawn that he has
been appointed for a monetary consideration?
That, in a community like ours, would destroy all
hocourable relations between men. We could
rot exist, because there is scarcely any person of
c jnspicuous ability who would not be excluded, if
euc i cons derations as these prevailed.” To test
the value of these pretty sentiments, we have
ly to mention the names of four men whom
Parkes appointed to the Legislative Council a
few months ago— Vickery, Watson, Pigott,
■ an d —with each of whom he had, ac-
cording to his schedule, monetary relations at the
time they were appointed. But nobody had dis
covered special claims to a seat in the CouncT
up to that time, and then it was whispered by ma-
I aant tongues that their claims were at least
partly of a monetary description. The schedule
gives prima- facie a certain amount of colour to
t he rumour.bat Sir Henry would have us believe
l ha‘ , in each of these cases, a man of “ conspicuous
abili’y ” was appointed for purely public reasons,
and we are bound to accept his word despite the
u f jitunateness of ihe coincide no.
♦ • •
Then, again, as regards the appointment of his
co’leegues Clarke, Roberts, Abigail, and
Sutherland - the line of defence was exactly the
same, and with no better results. He admits that
he was indebted to each of thefc po’itical cyphers
and shameless fiscal apostate t when he distributed
his portfolio t to the interne surprise and disgust of
his o vn supporters; but he dispu es the ‘ ‘ mo retary
consideration ” in each case, and insists upon the
« conspicuous ability ” of his men. The air of
triumph with which he denied that ho owed
Roberts £2500, and brought it down to only £2OO
was worthy of the immortal Mantalini. It did
not occur to him that the exact amount of the
debt was not a matter of any Importance when
the honour of the country, as well as his own,
was involved in the question at issue. It Is not
elough that Cesar’s wife should be virtuous—
a- e should even refrain from driving to Ceogee
with a strange man while her husband is a" the
o ffice. The charge made against Parkes. according
tu M Bihone’s privileged statement, was one of
corruption in its worst form —that of carrying on
an infamous traffic in the highest offices of the
S ate. It is no defence to such a charge to say
tTat the actual amount of the alleged “ coaside a-
tion ” was only a tenth part of the amount sup-
pised. The plain admission that there was in-
debtedness in all the cases referred to was enough
to involve him and his col eagues in suspicion.
• * *
The only thing in the nature of a parallel that
histo-y affords for snch a case as this—and we are
free to confess that it is more suggestive than
exact-is Sir Francis Bacon’s lamentable
exhibition before tne House of Lords. Anyone
wbo will turn to Mac iu lav's account of it in his
essay on Bacon will find some remarkable coifl-
ed -nces, and coatras s, too, between the great
C jaucel or’s las’: dying speech and confession, and
the rhetorical bravado of tne distingnisaed Premier
of N S W. “ Bacon addressed to the Peers a letter
which the Prince of Wats condescendei to deliver,
la this artful pathetic composition, the Chinoellor
ackeowledgfd h's guilt in gua-dei and general
tcira- and wnile acknowledging, endeavoured to
pallia e it.’’ But finding that the Peers were not
amenable to the influence of soft soap, in the shape
cf pathetic reference to the repose of the grave,
poor Bacon was compelled to swallow his physio,
ard in another letter he admitted the truth of the
accusation against him and threw himself entirely
on the mercy of the judges. “ Upon advised con-
sideration of the charges, descending Into my own
conscience, and calling my memory to account
ag far as I am able, I do plainly and ingenuously
confess that I am guilty of corruption, and do re-
nounce all defence " We, of course, do not say
that Parkes makes a Baconian confession, or
that there is any real resemblance between their
cases or their offences. Sir Henry admits that
appearances a e presumably against him, but he
strenuously denies that ib Is possible to draw
from his conduct any inference damaging to his
reputation as an honest politician.
* * *
There is eertainly a superficial parallel
to be found between these extraordinary oases
—the marked impartiality displayed by both
men under the m'st discour agi"g condi-
tions Bacon d'd not sell justice al
though he took money from suit us. His
victims found to their cost that money did not in-
fluence the even course of justice in the Court of
Chancery. So, too, it appears that the monetary
relations admitted to exist between Sir Henry
ard the men whom he has e 1 evaded to office at
different times, have never affected his views as
to the political fitness of things, because he has
borrowed with the strictest impartiality on all
sides. With his latest breath he his to dus that
“in every bitch of appointments for which I am
responsible, there have been men representing
different shades of opinion ” and wbat he says is
true. Somey ears ago, when the Kiama Ghost was an
exciting topic of discussion, Dalley —then at the
height of his oratorio il powers-created a great
deal of amusement by a speech in which he
quoted large l y from a schedule filed by Parkes
shortly before, in order to show how wonderfully
impartial he had been in his monetary relations
with politicians. Every shade of opinion was as
carefully represented in the list of creditors then
as It is now. There was not even a suspicion of
favouritism, and the fact reminded Dalley of a
passage in Macaulay, In which, describ’ng Marl-
borough’s pecuniary transactions, h e said that he
took money on all sides without any respect of
persons—whether it was a million francs from a
foreign prince, or twopence hilfpenny from a
British drummer-boy. There is, at least, one
thing to be said in his favour —and it sounds like
a le't-handed complim?nt— Parkes has been so
impartial in the matter of appointments that not
even political gratitude has inflected the disbursal
of his patronage.

The magnanimity with which Sir Henry chal-
lenged the Opposition to “ come on ” and fight it
out as a party question, was quite on a par with
the lofty scorn with which he repudiated the idea
of appealing to a court of Justice for redress
against his libellers. “This infamous conclusion,”
said he, “is well-known by every one to bo
utterly unfounded ” ; but nevertheless he would
have nothing more to do with jurymen. His ex-
perience of them in the Webb case was, no doubt,
so unsatisfactory that he was resolved to forswear
them for ever. Not even the command of the
Crown Law Officers would tempt him to take his
chance in the witness-box again. The Crown had
conducted the prosecution in the Webb case,
although he was not then a Minister of the
Crown ; but even with that powerful machinery
at his back, the result did not equal what we
may be permitted to hope were his anticipa-
tions. It was not in very good taste, by the way,
on the part of a Premier to state openly in Parlia-
ment that he had no confidence in the administra-
tion of justice, even in Crown prosecutions ; bur,
if Sir Henry distrusts jurors and judges, he
places imp’icit confidence in the discriminating
justice of a servile party vote. He dared the Op-
position to try conclusions with him on the spot,
knowing, of course, that he had a majority in a->y
event, and that, whatever the collective opinion
of the House might be on the merits of the case,
it would not consent to break up the Government
for the purpose of deciding a question of libel or
no libel. The House has no means of investigat-
ing the truth or falsehood of alleged libels against
ar yof its members. Now, if we contrast Sir
Henry’s eagerness to submit the matter to a
party vote on the one hand, with his and
his Attorney-General’s resolute aversion to
a criminal trial on the other, we have
a means of gauging his own opinion as to the
chances of a stand-up fight before a jury. Is not
that the kind of conclusion apt to be formed by
those of the public who, unlike Sir John Robert-
son, have had no means of personally satisfying
themselves of Premier Parkes’ unswerving
honesty and conscientiousness ?
* *
The conduct of the House in this matter is a
singular instance of its flexibility when a mere
question of principle is concerned- There is very
little room to doubt that Sic Hknry’s seat in the
AssemMy became vacant, in terms of the C insti-
tution Act, the moment he signed the deed of
assignment to his creditors ; and the very fl'st
s'ep that should have been taken —and which
certainly would have been taken in the case of a
private member—wa* to move a resolution de-
claring the scat to be vacant Then the Speaker's
writ for a new election at St. Leonards wou'd
have fol’owed, and it would have been left
to his constituents to re-elect him or not,
as they ra’ght please. That was the pro-
per, straightforward, constitutional course to
adopt; but instead of that the House
quietly ignored tin Constitution Act in deference
to the Premier’s deicate position and the con-
venience of party. Tne members of the Opposi-
tion, no doubt, were, naturally enough, restrained
from taking any action at the time which might
have the app’arance of “jumping on a man when
he’s down ”; but sentimental considerations are
wholly out of place when the integrity of the Con-
s’ itutlon is concerned. The object of the enact-
ment that a member forfeits his seat on becoming
insolvent is to prevent the scandal which would
otherwise attach to his position ; for if one mem-
ber of the Legislature can retain his seat after de-
claring his insolvency, every other member may
do the same, and then we might, peradventure,
live to see a whole house full of jovial insolvents.
At the very least—and if only to save appearances
—the question whether the seat was vacated
should have been referred to the Committee of
Elections and Qualifications to determine form-
ally and judicially. Whatever their verdict might
have been, it would have served the very useful
purpose of showing that the law of Parliament is
no respecter of person*. Under the circumstances
the matter will no doubt be brought before the
Supreme Court in the shape of an action against
Sir Henry to re jover penalties for h’s having sat
and voted while insolvent.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Sava Parkas Prom His Friends.
Sir Henry Parkks has (for the severalth time)
gone up the spout—this time just prior to the
passing of his own Ministry's Bankruptcy Law
Amendment Bill. He is not, it is held, technically
speaking, ai insolvent, and consequently he is
not compelled to resign his seat in the N.S.W.
Assembly. As a consequence of this he was
enabled last week to expound his views on
honesty and a number of other matters to the
listening members of the N.S W. Assembly, and
in a speech-one-quarter whining apology, one-
quarter bravado, and the rest a mixture of wrath
and pathos about his own grey hairs—to state his
views on a number of subjects, among which tbe
contemptible virtue of paying 20s. in the £ was
tbe most conspicuous. “ Are there not pro-
curesses of innocent women for ihe basest pur-
poses,” he demanded, “who pay 20s in the £?
Are there not men who are guilty of the vilest
crimes under heaven who pay 20s. in the £?’
This kind of honesty, accordirg to Parkks, is a
very mean virtue indeed, although when money
is owing by the public to the Calico Jimmies, who
are the mainstay of his party, they regard it
as the greatest and noblest trait in the human
charac er. Many of Parkks' supporters, how-
ever, prove by their lives that they are
of his way of thinking, and many more,
though they have paid 20s. in the £, have
not been over particular how that 20s. was
obtained. lathis matter Attorney General Wise
evidently lacks the courage of Parkks’ opinions,
and when declining to take proceedings agalasti
the papers which reflected so strongly on the
Premier’s debts and the manner in which they
were incurred, he took shelter behind the far-
reaching fortification of his own comprehensive
ignorance. He “did not read the Sunday
Times,” and knew nothing of the allegations con-
tained in that paper regarding his chief, and he
did not propose to bring obscure country and
other editors into prominence by setting in motion
against them the cumbrous machinery of the
criminal law. Such a thing, according to this
young man fresh from Europe, had not been done
in New South Wales for many years, from which
wo presume that Mr. Ringnose Wise, in the
plentitude of the things he doesn’t know, has
never learned how, some three or four
years ago, his predecessor in office, Attorney-
General Dai.ley, instituted criminal proceed-
ings against a printer named Webb, who had
levelled at one Henry Parkks the foulest charges
ever slung at a politician south of the lino. Pro-
bably he never read the evidence in that famous
case, and consequently he may not be aware that,
after two trials, Parkes’ counsel failed to con-
vince a jury of Parkes' countrymen that the ac-
cusations against him were so utterly devoid of
truth as to call far the immurement of Webb in a
dungeon. Still, Mr. Wise's conduct is perplexing.
If he is so utterly ignorant of the recant history
of the country he helps to govern, how is it
that he hesitates to enter upon his duty of in
the Cmrt defending Parkes from the new
avalanche of charges levelled against him, and
considers it safer to leave the heartless old
man to defend himself by whining re’erenoes to
tbe grey hairs which Webb dragged so low I And
if he is aware of the sweet revenge which Dailey
wreaked on his political enemy by undertaking his
defence and thereby loading him with threefold
ignominy, why does he appeal to precedent as his
reason for leaving his chief in the lurch 1 If Mr.
Wise is really in Ignorance of the evidence brought
forward in the case of Webb, it is time for him
either to refresh his memory regarding it—or else
to read it for the first time. His ignorance may
possibly furnish excuse for his past conduct in sit-
ting as Parkes' colleague, but nothing else can,
and when his mental darkness has been enlight-
ened he must either abjure the unclean thing or
else identify himself with it and be judged by the
company he keeps. Also, he should commence a
painstaking study of the Sunday paper which he
has ro much neglected, and ask himself whether,
in view of the blasting statements which it con-
tinues to publish, and professes to support by
documentary evidence, there is not now an urgent
necessity for putting the ponderous engine of the
criminal law into immediate motion. So far, the
only step taken on behalf of Sir Henry Parkes has
been for the relief of his pocket; the relief of his com-
mercial reputation has been completely neglected.
A v’gorous effort has been initiated to raise a
subscription on behalf of the necessitous Hi Ham,
and his creditors are kindly lending a hand.
Whether enough will be ra'sed to pay 20*. in tbe
£ to all those who have trusted Sir Henry from the
commencement of his career to the present dry Is
more than doubtful, and considering Parkes’B
lofty contempt for the dull, commonplace virtue
of solvercy—the b-and of an ignoble soul, the
sordid sentiment which leads stupid, plodding
citizens to pay their debts in full—it is hardly
likely that the conti ibutio is of the public will be
applied to any such purpose. The Prenrers
friends still allege that their .white-headed fefoT
is a necessity ; the country, they assert, cannot
do without him, and therefore tbe bottomless hat
must be passed round on his behalf. It is a pity
that the long-drawn-out farce cannot be cut short.
If Parkks's party can prove that their leader is
inlispensable to the country it would be better
that his necessities should be met at once by a vote
of anything up to £lOO,OOO from the public
treasury. His creditors could then be paid in full
and induced to belch forth no more unfounded
libels, and the balance remaining after the per-
formance of this act of retrospective integrity
would enable the Premier to keep his place and
continue to save the country from plunging into
the aby«s. If Parkes is necessary to the country
the country ought to pay for him; if he is not
worth paying for let him go—in one act. If his
friends believe only one-half of what they say
they will move for an immediate vote on their
leader’s behalf, and Australia will then be spared
the spectacle of a Premier, who retains his seat
simply through his good fortune in being a few
days ahead of his own Ministry's Amend'ng
Insolvency Act, accepting charity in his
old age. New South Wales has suffered
disgrace enorgh without this final addition
to her sorrows at the hands of a man who
publ'dy is so virtuous and self-sacrificing that he
objects to members of Parliament being paid for
their services out of the Consolidated Revenue.
Young’s Ignominy.
Despite the exhibition of his own fathomless
iznorance and want of tact made by Speaker
Young in the N. S.W. Assembly the other day,
that gentleman is apparently resolved to adhere
to the position in which he has so successfully
h eld himself up to public derision. Probably, as it was
Parses whotookhim away from the seclusion of hla
produce-store to make him what he is, he regards
the white-headed Premier as the person chiefly to
blame for the troubles which have ensued, and if so
ho is about right. The great Ki-Ham hardly ever,
by any chance, makes a political appointment which
does not bear the outward semblance of a job, and
for selecting the halt, the lame, and the blind, and
pitching them into high office, be has no equal in
the Australian colonies. A lot of Speaker Young’s
life has been spent in counting eggs, and weighing
potatoes, and barneying over carrots, and he has
had many a hairbreadth escape from being sucked
in over a line of beans, and in his calmer moments
he can almost always tell oats from bran at the
very first go, and when it comes to raising a point
ef privilege with a Chinese bargainer, or rul-
ing an old woman out of order when she wants
to trade off a keg of ghastly grease as prime butter,
he has few equals; but these things don’taltogether
qualify a man to be Speaker of a Legislative As-
sembly. Neither does a long and varied experience
in boot-uppers make Abigail a Minister of Mines,
any more than an extended acquaintance with
long beers fits Roberts to be Postmaster-General,
yet Parkhs precipitated both these men into the
yawning void of Ministerial aggravation, seem-
ingly for the express purpose that their profound
knowledge of beer and boots might be placed at
the disposal of the Cabinet. Parses' fatal knack
of appointing every accommodating ignoramus to
high office is responsible for almost all the con-
spicuous failures who now draw big salaries from
the public purse in New South Wales, and Mr.
Young, who continues to hold the Speakership
after he has degenerated into the Aunt Sally of
the Lower House, probably consoles himself with
the reflection that he is no worse than the rest.
No doubt wnen Parkes drops on some one even
more stupid and more hopelessly incompetent
than he, Mr. Young will be sent back to the con-
genial gloom of the egg-repository, but till then
his billet appears to be pretty safe, and ho will
continue to deliver his amazing decisions from
the chair, and lose himself in a fog of precedents
which have no more to do with the case under
discussion them the sale of donkey-feed has with
the spectrum analysis. The produce business
is no doubt an honest occupation, but it is not
elevating to the mental faculties. As a demo-
cratic paper The Bulletin in no sense objects to
any man occupying the chair of the Assembly
because he trades in eggs and bacon, but it objects to
Speaker Young because, for all practical purposes
the eggs and bacon might just as well be in the
c nair as he. N. B. Orders for vegetables promptly
attended to.
Sydney Daily Telegraph is gradually taking
up the position of censor of political conduct, and
occasionally it waxes very wroth with politicians
whose career refuses to square with abstract poli-
tical principle. The other day the D.T. demanded
in a fierce philippic that the incompetent Speaker
Young should leave the chair. But Speaker
Young never buys a pig in a poke, and point-
blank s»id “he wouldn’t.” A few days after-
wards, the same journal made a similar demand
off Attorney-General Wise, but Wise likewise de-
clined. At last the D.T. turns its bull's-eye on
Premier Parkes himself. For the length of one
column and a half it would seem that the hungry
cry for vacation would be heard—but it isn't
The D.T. admits that Sir Henry, as a matter of
principle, should resign, and it gets hold of this
point and accentuates it and rubs it in and rivets
it down, and then clinches it with burred washers,
and—finally gives it up. It would be better, says
the D T., that the principle should go to ultra-
marine-tinted oblivion than that the country
should lose Parkes' great services. But where
are we to draw the line ? Would it not be better
at once to say that great statesmen ere exempt
from the operation of the Decalogue ? Then comes
the question, “How great?” According to tnis,
principle in politics is a farce. Expediency is the
only political principle. For instance, what does
the alleged Free trade of New South Wales
amount to ?

Hugh Miller, at the end of a vigorous life, blew
his brains out. The trouble was a theological
one. Genesis and geology wouldn’t mix. Arguing
from analogy, a like conclusion might consistently
be expected for Editor Ward, of the Sydney H.T.
For months has he endeavoured to account for
Parkes’ erratiolsms of conduct by rules de-
duced from conceptions of abstract administrative
rectitude, but it won’t do. Bring in the horse-
pistol and load it with a double-leaded leader—
there’s no other recourse—Parkes and Political
Parity will not amalgamate. The only wonder is
that the attempt has been persevered in for so
long. It argues a ghastly rectangularlty of brain j
convolution in a man that he cannot see the
humour of plaiting out Premier Parkes’ life on a
political Bible.

The other day, in Victoria, a man was charged
with bigamy. He was living apart from his fl'tt
wife. Hts second wife considered him “one of the
best of husbands,” and declined to bear evidence
against him. On her own showing the first wife
had refused a reconciliation on the grounds that
she had lost all faith in her husband. Yet the red-
tape desit e to punish for the transgression of a law
which has more real existence in the statute-book
than in the nature of things, sends or will even-
tually send, this man to gaoh It does not mend
the first wife’s fortunes, it cwtaioly destroys the
second wife’s peace, hope, and happiness. To
what end ? Simply that a man should ba punished
for a questionable offence. Questionable, because
the Deity has approved, according to Christian
ministers, of polygamy. God cannot lie. What
He once stamps with his Divine approval He
stamps for all time. To assert otherwise is to say
God is mutable. This, from the Christian’s stand-
point, would be blasphemy. Says some one:
“ But times are changed, laws are to be observed
from motives of expediency.” We reply that no
expedient can be framed capable of putting aside
Divinely-appointed law. Bat, suppose the Sydney
D.T. is right, suppose it is better that a Premier
should govern in the face of a broken principle on
the plea that the country suffers less from a trans-
gressed principle than it would from the rule of
the Opposition t Very good. Is not this case of
bigamy one of those oases in which the com-
munity would suffer less from an unpunished
offence, than, all the circumstances considered, from
a punished offence ? Mind you, we are not here
apologising for bigamy. The average workman
finds it quite hard enough to support one wife in
a country ruled by a shoddy ring. We are only
trying to be logical. We have proved that the
N.S.W. “ Freetrade Press " should openly defend
polygamy.

It is difficult to reckon op the number of
things which have been thrown out of the
Wandering Jew” in order to turn it into the
drama which, under the title of “ All For Gold,"
is now running prosperously at Sydney Gaiety.
The whole Society of Jesuits is shucked out into
space ; so is Adrienne, and her nigger lover, and
her venomous aunt—who afterwards went off her
old grey head, and the lunatic asylum, and the
cholera; also the dog, Goliah—the dull giant
whose eye was knocked out with a wooden shoe,
sundry Thugs, the crowd who mashed the head
of Father d’Aigrigney against the wall of the
Cathedral, a youth with snakes in his boots,
Herodias, and many more. Seme of them are no
great loss, but others are badly missed. Father
Roden, the flabby old priest who dined in a cellar
on carrots—the man with the long nails and the
broken teeth and the t mile— might at least have
been spared, for the frowsy Hebrew who has been
Inserted in his stead is the weakest of all substi-
tutes, and moreover, in the absence of the priest,
the story goes pretty much to wreck. Fortun-
ately the Wandering Jew himself has not
been altogether wiped out. He is a very
subordinate character, but he is still
there the same old self-reliant, walking
Oanaanlte and moveable Mutual Loan and Dis-
count Company, all rolled into the person of one
old man, who drags out his 1800 years of existence
as his own three-ball sign and bill-of-sale in the
wilderness. The acting, however, makes up for
many of the things that have been bounced out of
the drama. Mr. Dampier’s Dagobert Boudin is a
splendid delineation of the old soldier of the Em-
pire, and the two very small ladies—Misses
Phoebe Levy and Amy Davis—who play the parts
of Lily and Rose Simon, afford one of the best
specimens of childish acting we have ever wit-
nessed. Mr. Boothman is a fearfully and wonder-
fully inoffensive missionary in these days when
the itinerant apostle makes the niggers work 16
hours a day on his account and owns a three-
storey house with empty champagne bottles scat-
tered for two miles round. Also, Mr. Baker gives
a hideously exaggerated picture of Morok, the
lion-tamer, and can’t even ask a stranger to
pass the bread without putting ber-lnd into his
tones. The rest of the cast is about up to the
average high-water mark.

We paused on our road towards old age
and the poor-house—or else the lunatic asylum—
to call in at Sydney Opera House where the long-
drawn-out and popular St. Maur is playing a new
comedy called “ Brighton." This piece reminds
us in places of “ Tne Professor” and in other
places of “ Pink Dominoes," and in some more
places it reminds us of some other things, but the
total result is disappointing. The hero, Sackett,
is a man with a pair of legs that run in the
family, who is engaged simultaneously to three
girls and a widow. One of them has apa who
has been three times insolvent, one is the daughter
of old Yanderpump, and the widow is a thing of
joy whose hair accidentally got into his mouth in
a conservatory, and whose first husband married
her because he was taken by the beautiful way
she fell out of a trap along with her first lover.
The first lover is also taken by the way the hus-
band fell out of the world altogether, leaving all
his money behind him, and with his last accents he
warranted his weeping relict to be sound and free
from vice, and calculated to drive a man off his
head in double harness. The remaining girl to
whom Sackett is engaged has got a husband
already. To any ordinary man, who, like our-
selves, has struggled through the tempest of
youth, and in his sere and yellow leaf has hung
his scalp on a nail in a quiet hermitage and re-
solved to spend his old age in taking steps to
dodge the eternal roast, these would seem to be
quite sufficient, but Sackett goes on till there is a
girl to whom he is engaged undressing in every
bathing machine, and her hair is drifting into
every basin of soup in the city, and her feet get
into every blanc mange at every picnic for miles
around. But even if the author had slung in 1100
more girls and each one had worn her dress low
enough to show 1100 times more of her shoulders
than the whole crowd in the bill, he couldn’t make
“ Brighton ” a great success. Nature meant this
literary Zulu to earn a precarious living by hold-
ing up mahogany tables in his jaw in the presence
of a large and fashionable audience, or possibly
he might rise to fame by driving an umbrella into
the Emperor of Russia and then opening it among
his vitals, but his name will not be remembered
in comedy. The company deserves something a
little better than this playful kittenlsm in four
acts. Mr. St. Maur, as Robert Sackett, is light-
some, airy, and attractive as of old ; Mr. Palmer
is intensely amusing as the deaf old Yanderpump,
and Miss Florence Seymour is improving every
day. Misses Marie Wilton and Leighford
are also nice in a modified sort of way, and if Mr.
Chanter were a little less stiff, and Mr. Harris not
quite so stagey, and Mr. Whitford didn’t look
quite so much as if he wanted to fly and get out
of the whole affair, the company would be an
eminent success. We nearly forgot to mention
that the Quv'nor was present on the opening
night, and yawned quite a number of times.
Will some artist kindly draw a page at once on
Governor Carington’s artistically-concealed yawn ?

and made of him an object that wasn’t fit

him, and transformed him back into the old,

Mr. Charles Holloway also woke up Dr. Ceneri from

cided hit as Pauline; and Mr. Brian Darley rose to
the level of the occasion a good part of the time in
the part of Gilbert Vaughan. The rest of the
time he didn’t rise so much. A few remarks
Which we intended making with regard to Mr.
Plumstead are held over in a sympathetic spirit, as
it is just possible he may be an orphan. We never
like to bear hard on orphans, the present scribe
himself having been fatherless ever since the old
man’s lamented exit. The rest of our enthusiasm
is reserved for the soenerv, which was exquisite.

The Sydney Alhambra continues to look
up, and the present programme is as good as any
that have preceded it. Perhaps it is even a little
better—we really can't say. When we plant our
remains on the front seat we generally commence
drawing mental portraits of one or other of the
pretty girls on the stage till we begin to dream
about her, and then the door-keeper comes round
and asks us to kindly stop snoring, and we awake
with a yawn the size of a piano, and find the per-
formance just finishing.

“ Much Ado about Nothing ” is announced

We dropped iu, the other day, at Bondi
Aquarium. It is a pleasant spot on the edge of
the cool sea-waves, and surrounded by what w«s
once a great expanse of rock and sand and naked-
ness, but which is now being rapidly changed
into lawns and gardens. The main building is
devoted to the sardine, the catfish, the shrimp,
and other denizens of the deep; they are not
very numerous as yet, but the stock is fast in-
creasing, and soma curious specimens have a place
in the menagerie. The placid sharks bask by
themselves in a pond on the hillside, waiting for
babies, twins, or other offerings from a grateful
public, and a little further on the seals also play a
lone hand. There is a water merry-go-round, and
a lot of other things, including a camera. This is
a sort of infernal machine in a dark hut, and its
apeciality is that it casts reflected pictures on a
sheet by which the visitor can see at a glance all
that is going on within a quarter of a mile. What
we saw in that camera would have burst up seven
ha PPy homes, and turned seven wives, one mother-
la -law, two grandmothers, an uncle, and 22 ohil-
d ren out into a cold, unsympathetic world. There-

and has small feet and white teeth, and a smile
that is like a fall in the price of eggs. The acro-

at the Standard now by falling down from the
roof to the stage and then falling up again, and
the burlesque, “ H.M. Mud Barge, North Shore,”

“Modern Wives”—a story of comic
quarrels and sweet reconciliations between those I
whom the parson has joined together—is doing
good biz. at Melbourne Bijou. The comedy is
adapted from “ Le Bonheur Conjugal,” but the
adapter has so conscientiously laboured to put
away all superfluity of French naughtiness that
very little human nature remains. It represents
young married men and young married ladies as
plunging into a vortex of despair during a separa-
tion of three short weeks. The husbands become
lean and hollow-eyed in a vain struggle to enjoy
bachelor life—the wives And grass-widowhood in
the home of a wealthy pa to be a burden unen-
durable. This is greedily swallowed by maidens
who read poetry-books in bed, and it also thrills
the untutored hearts of their fellars. But such
as have tasted the sweets of matrimony and
“ fairly copped the flavour,” follow the workings
of this plot with one shut eye and a hollow-
chuckle. “ Modern Wives ”is pushed right along
by Brough and Boucicault's company and stage
manager. The men are active on their feet, and
the ladies throw heavenly light on ridiculous
situations. Mr. Brough and Miss Romer play the
heavy parents with an airy touch. Mr. Cecil
Ward (who was oppressively sentimental in
“ Held by the Enemy ”) is now free and frisky to
a pleasing degree, also other pleasing things about
this young scrangsr are his duck of a moustache
and his O 1 such lovely eyes. Mr. F. Laye does
all that’s required with neatness and disoatch ; so
does Miss Trevelyan. And Miss Boucicaulr,
called upon to show “ temper ” in its early Spring
aspects, goes one better than she has ever gone
hitherto. Small parts are wallzed through by
Mr. Boucicault, Miss Emma Temple, Miss Robina,
and others whom the gods love. Down to a boy in
buttons, and the furniture and fittings, everything
has a polish on it. Therefore, “Modern Wives”
will continue to point a misleading moral until
after that Cup for which so many “ morals ” have
been pointed that one can’t think what to back,
unless it s Tranter at a nice long pries. At the
first blush this doesn’t sound like a theatrical
item, but now is the time for criticising the
sundry shows of performers on four legs.

•‘La Fille du Tambour Major ” brought
back prosperity to Melbourne Princess’ on Satur-
day. All in a hurry Mr. Harwood emerged from
seclusion to assume the honours and titles of the
Due de Della Volta. There is only one Duo, and
John Wallace is his Marquis Bambini. Sundry
Arthur Orton chaps have tried to pass themselves
off as those same noblemen in Europe, but the
miserable impostors axe soon found out, and the
world forgets them. Out here “ Tambour Major ”
is a popular opera supported by two actors who
can t sing worth a cent. When the music dries
up and the stage is left to that dear Due with his
meandering Bambini—then the opera reaches its
summit of success, From among the rest Mr,
Knight Aston stands out conspicuous for his
make-no as the Major. Miss Colbourne Baber’s
cultivated voice is wasted on the music of the
name part; and Miss .Aggie Kelton must grow
smaller by degrees and less beautiful before she
can be taken for a little drummer-boy. Supers
and scenery are liberally put on.

Italian Opera still draws good crowds to
Melbourne Royal when the spirit moves them,
but more than one of the songsters have shown
symptoms of overwork. Signora Tagliavia’s vocal
tubes are a little rough inside just for the moment,
as was pre try evident in “Faust.” Miss Julia
Simmons made a first appearance as Siebel in this
opera, and succeeded well enough in a quiet way.
Mr. Simonsen hopes to work the oracle with

agonies in respectable style, assisted by a com-
pany which includes some capable members of
the profeshun. Melody and light comedy prevail
at the larger Melbourne theatres, but the Nugget
keeps strictly to suicide and sudden death. You
can sup on horrors for a shilling at this estab-

At Brisbane Royal, the “Mikado " retires
on Saturday to make way for “La Mascot to.”
Carrie Swam, who closed her season with a bar-

reigns in her stead, is playing “ Masks and Faces ”
to pretty good audiences.

there is still some coin left in the righteous city.
Of the new faces appearing in the opera Messrs

all together, is a strong one. “ Pirates of Pen-

Alice May (Mrs, G. B. Allen), well-known
as a comic opera-singer in the colonies, died sud-

August. She was 10 years old, and a native of
England.
Speaking of that cheeky little ballad, singer
who appeared under the name of Lily Langtry at
Bathurst, reminds us of another festive damsel
who toed the footlights in Melbourne as Miss
Burdett-Coutts. We reckon the Baroness Is just
about old enough for the ballet.
Victorian Supreme Court has just nullified a con-
viction made by alleged “justices” at Huntly
against an engine-driver for “misconduct in bis
hired service,” said misconduct being that he left
after giving notice to the chief engineer instead of
to the manager. The court acted well. But it is
abominable that a law should exist by which a
labouring man is indictable like a criminal for rt •
lie finishing his situation at any moment he thinks
fit. What is it but to say that the man is an ab-
sconding slave, and the mere property of his em-
ployer until the engagement is formally released ?
If ihe employer thinks fle to terminate the contract
without notice is he pursued with a “ conviction ”
and branded as an evil member of society ? On the
other band altogether I and the workman can con-
sider himself lucky if he is able even to maintain
a civil action for any notice-fee at all. It is high
time that this miserable, serf-making, money-
toadying provision should be expressly repealed.
Or at all events be fair, and if it is necessary to put
the “ man ” in gaol when he looks elsewhere for a
better bargain, do the same by the “master.’
Ip there is anything in the dream of “British
justice" it was surely shown In the trial of Mr.
O'Brien at Mitchelstown, when the counsel for
the defence set forth that a hostile Government
had deliberately suppressed the true version of
the alleged seditious speech, and the Court there-
upon, without fear or favour, adjourned for the
purpose of causing a proper investigation to be
held, and permitting due evidence to be obtained,
upon such an important point in the case.
At least one might possibly have imagined so.
What was really done was to eject the counsel for
the defence for speaking the truth in a non-formal
way, and to find the prisoner guilty in the absence
of any skilled defender, whilst the Crown had a
professional champion all through. The Bench
throughout took up a position of antagonism to
Nationalists, and were profuse in their efforts bo
arrest each and every of them throughout the
trial. And this is termed “impartial justice.”
Since the removal of the ad valorem duties, the
export and import trade of Sydney has begun to
boom. This fact wi 1 doubtless be mentioned
wicn feelings of pride by Treasurer Burns in the
’Ousa, and in case he neglects to mention one of
the great causes of this sudden activity, we may
as well explain how it comes about. Many of
the Sydney merchants have a large stock of mer-
chandise on hand in unbroken packages, on which
merchandise the ad valorem duties were levied,
and paid with much regret. These packages are
now being shipped off to Melbourne, and the
duties previously paid are refunded to
the happy owners under the name of
drawbacks—according to the ordinary cus-
tom In such cases—in order that the exporter
may not be placed at an unfair disadvan-
tage when selling in a foreign market. And then
the goods come back again in the same steamer
which carried them away (never having been
taken out of the ship), and are re-imported
under the blessings of a Freetrade tariff. By a
special arrangement, shipowners take the pack-
ages on their double journey at a rate of 14s. per
ton, and thus all parties are satisfied. Treasurer
Burns might as well take note of what Parkes's
supporters are about in this matter, or there wbl
be another unaccountable shortage in his next
financial statement.

As the N.S.W. Agent-General’s Office
contains not a single clerk who has ever been to
Australia, it is not to be wondered at that the
Emigration Information Office, which is a Govern-
ment institution in London founded to supply
prompt and reliable ignorance to persons about to
leave for the colonies, is doing a great work.
Already it has dumped down more new chums in
the God-forsaken parts of the earth than are ever
likely to get back again, and when anyone calls
to inquire about any place that the office knows
nothing about —and it knows nothing about more
places than any other institution ever heard of—
the inquirer is informed that it is in the interior
of Australia, or South Africa, or Canada, just as
the junior clerk happens to be feeling at the
moment. The last man whom the office took in
made his inquiries by letter, and was informed
that Victoria was the capital of South Australia,
and Melbourne the chief seaport of New South
Wales, and then by way of helping him to get
there, the Department shot him down in New
Zealand. The knowledge he had acquired carried
him as far as a humpy somewhere on the West
Coast, and then it left him suddenly, and he now
waits for further instructions, and spends his
spare time in reeling out complex and hideous
anathemas on the Emigration Information Office,
and on fine days he climbs a hill and strains his
eyes across the heaving waters in the vain hope
that Melbourne (N.S.W.) may heave in sight on
the distant horizon. But it never does heave, and
he expects to die in his lonely exile.

medicine, cat-modicine— anything that would re-
lieve his smitten frau, and it was with difficulty
the chemist prevented him grabbing a quart of
soap liniment and flying away to administer it
right off. “What’s the matter? 1 ’ he said,
peevishly; “What’s happened to you? Who’s

Australia has something to boast about
that we didn’t know of. According to a speech
delivered by Dr. Verco at the Adelaide Mpdioal
Congress this continent is ahead of Europe in the
matter of hydatids, and a mysterious disease
called ptygerium is all our own. Also the com-
plaint called “ Barcoo rot” is an Australian spe-
ciality, to say nothing of “ fllaria,” so that we
have an opportunity to die in great agony in
various ways that the benighted European never
heard of. We can only hope that Australians
won’t begin to blow too much over these advan-
tages. Though this continent may be the home of
the priceless ptygerium, the colonists should still
preserve a modest demeanour, and might even
drop a tear of sympathy for the poor old mother
land which hasn’t any fllaria and is short of hyda-
tids. We can sympathise with her. We have
visited that weeping country, ard if we hadn’t
taken a hydatid along with us it is difficult to
describe how lonesome we would have felt. Ex-
cepting our own there wasn’t a reliable one within
miles of up.

When the gifted Smiles wrote hia work on

times, but his book doesn’t seem to suit the re-

through it carefully and we ban find nothing in it
that applies to the case of a man-name at pre-
sent unknown—who visited a lonely house near
Melbourne, the other day, and helped himself to
a chest of drawers, a sofa, fender and fire-irons, a
watch-dog, 16 hens, a tortoiseshell cat, 101 b. of
mutton, 36 eggs, some Jewellery, a quantity of
plated cutlery, an “ Encyclopaedia Britanniea,” a
clock, three white mice, a tame guinea pig,
seven sh’Vs, a silk dress, a belltoppcr, two coats.
IJ, pairs of boots, a bronze figure with nothing on,
a vase, a desk, a workbox, an earthenware dog,
an easy chair, a steel-trap, and a Wane mange
which hadn’t yet got cold, and who also sat down
on a tart, and broke three windows, and emptied
about 501 b. of assorted food on the drawing-room
carpet and then jumped on it. This is ab.ut ihe
most comprehensive case of self-help which has
come under our notice for acme time.

For bland, picturesque innocence—the sort

JUSTICE TEMPERED BY SPORT.
FITZROY(MELR.) BENCH (to muscular person with barber's pole stockings and black eye) :
“YOU ARE CHARGED WITH BEING DRUNK AND DISORDERLY, AND
ASSAULTING THE POLICE. WHAT DO YOU PLEAD?”
MUSCULAR PERSON: “I PLEAD THAT I AM A FOOTBALLER, YOUR WORSHIP,”
(Prisoner instantly discharged without a stain on his character.)
has kept his soul pure and undefiled, hut he has a
sort of general knowledge that there are females
in existence who —but we will lot• him speak for
himself:— . ' W ,
“ Mr. Richardson has no personal knowledge of these ba-s,
but he believes numheis of respectable citizens have been
shocked bv being decoyed into private tars presided over by
women: that he was informed that there were women
there with whom arrangements might have been made ; that
the dresses were unbecoming, and that some of the girls sa‘,
on the men’s knees and threw their arms round their necks.”
Prom this we are inclined to imagine that some-
one has been stuffing the poor old child, and has
led Richardson to stultify himself on mere
hearsay evidence. Consequently, we rise to ad-
monish the old teetotaller. There aren’t any such
women. If Mr. Richardsoa will, in pursuance of
his enquiries into the N.S.W. liq aor-system, step
into a private bar and ask a girl to sit on his knee
she will bellow for the police and glvehimin charge
as a rude man. and if he endeavours to assail her
affections with the tear of sensibility he will get
thrown out. A private bar is simply a place where
coffee and buns are distributed, and where the
chaplain of the establishment rises to make a few
Christian remarks every half hour. Also the
eldest barmaid hears the customers say their cate-
chism. The fast that there are a lot of girls about
some of these places has led wicked teetotallers to
draw unebaribab’e inferences when they ought to
bed rawing tho baby abou t in a peram' ml ator instead,
but the fact is that the girls are employed to prepare
illuminated Scripture texts, for which there is a
great demand. As for the assertion that the
dresses are unbecoming, we have no patience
with it. No doubt the sombre bonnets and veils
which many of the young ladies assume as the
mark of their saeved calling are not picturesque,
but we have no sympathy with the wanton old
bald-head who persuaded Mr. Richardson
to lodge that complaint, simply because he
the baldhead had a morbid craving for
tights. If Mr. Richardson had only taken
the trouble to enquire a little further before
he started out to blast a noble enterprise his
name would not have stood so good a chance as it
does of being covered with the objurgations of
posterity. The bar is the one institution in the
great country of New South Wales which ia
watched over and kept pure by the best
efforts of a paternal Government. Before a man
is admitted to it he has to undergo three years of
continuous study, and during the last twelve
months he is not allowed even to engage in
any other occupation lest he should become
demoralised, but is*require 1 to devote hia time to
sublime and holy contemplation of the bar iteel
—also the barmaid. At the end of that time, if he
is found worthy, he is admitted, but not other-
wise. Yet, in the face of all these precautions,
Mr. Richardson would have us believe that men
are “decoyed” into the bar—in fact, that they
can rush in any time —and that when they
are in girls ia sh'rt petticoats sit on their
knees. With this astounding piece of absurdity
before us, we can oMy demand feebly if his mother
knows ho is out? We would like to ask Mr.
Richardsoa, in a qaiet sirt of way, what his idea
of Heaven mar be. Does he think it is made of
stone and holds about two gallons, or does ho look
forward to spending an eternity amid Ely-ian
fields of perpetual verdure, pervaded by everlast-
ing girls in tights ? It looks like it, judging from
the way he goes on during his pilgrimage on
earth, and we can only urge him to repent before
it is too late, or the chances are that, instead of
his vision being realised, he will find himself in a
very tight place indeed.

One of the saddest stories we ever read ia
that of the sea sickness which fell upon William
George Powell, of Seven Oaks, in the Macleay
district of N.S.W., and brought his honoured
name into the lee-souppers, William George
traded in pickles and other edibles for about six
months, at the end of which tlmo he fell in love
with a farmer's daughter, and ultimately he sold
out his bui-iness for £lO9O to her brother and her
pa. As he owed £l7OO, this bargain did not pre-
mise very well for his creditors, but, like a true
hero, he put the money in a cash-hex, and started
for Sydney by sea, with a view to paying what he
could. He did not get a draft because he possibly
had never heard of such a thing, and he d d not
give his wealth to the care of the captain, proba-
bly because he thought that gentleman might be
tempted to keep it and cover his crime by
heaving him into the briny deep. So he
sat on deck with his cash-box, and pre-
sently he found that he was going to heave
up hia whole immortal soul. Bounding over
the deep didn't agree wish him ; there was
nothing of the sea-horse in his composition, and
he had a sensation of goneness in tbe region of the
epigastrium. But even while he weltered in agony
on the deck he continued to clutch his precious
box ; he wallowed with it in the trough of the
sea, and when he begged the stewardess with
tears in hia eyes to throw him overboard, he still
had it, and he meant to sink with it down to the
darksome emerald caves where slimy things crawl
with long jointed legs over the ribs of sunken
ships anl the carpet of drowned men’s bones. Bat
at last the riot that was going on in his inward-
ness became too much for him, and going to the
side he rested the box on the rail and threw up all
engagements and everything that made life worth
having in one prolonged yah - yaw—yaw - yah—ah
—aw ! When this act of public worship was over,
and he raised his head, the cash was missing. It
had gone down to join the leviathan, the sea-ser-
pent, the winkle, and the whale. There wasn’t a
cent left for the creditors, unless they were pre-
pared to dive and wrest the money from the crabs
of the great deep, and William George has gone
into bankruptcy.

The Evening Noose's conundrums are growing
stale and unprofitable, and the public, who used
to rush for the paper to find out why John Haynes
was like a yard of tripe, or something equally inter-
esting, now lac guidly let the question slide C onun •
drums can t go on for ever, and by the time the
Noose rises and explains that it is because no re-
spectable person would have it on the table, public
interest in the Escaped John and the tripe is worn
to the bone. Under these circumstances it is with
due diffidence that we rise to propound a conun-
drum of our own, and if no answer is forthcoming
we will not feel effenied. It is base! on a little
event which happened a short whi e ago in a little
town far up the Darling, and the circumstances
are voached for by a commercial traveller, an in-
surance agent, a faith-healer, and the oldest in-
habitant. There were two publicans in the town —
one was named Schultz and the other was Higgin-
botham —but in spite of this the supply of liquor
ran out last summer, and the inhabitants were left
to parch. After a while Higginbotham raised
five gallons of rum -as for Schultz he raised no-
thing at all—and for two solid months tbe
whole town rioted in liquor at Higginbotham’s
bar, and still that five gallons did not fail, Hig-
ginbotham failed himself, however, owing to land
speculations, and then he sold oat his stock, con-
sisting of the remains of the rum, to Sohultz, and
for three months more the town rioted at Schultz's
bar and the I'quor was sUll there All this time
no more had teen received, bat all the same when
Hans Boschiter started a pub. in a new township
five miles away, Schultz sold him 50 gallons of
rum, and then another month passed away, and
the public quenched its thirst with Schultz and
got raging drunk on the premises of Hans Bos-
chiter, and the keg continued to hold out. Bos-
chiter, meanwhile, had no liquor at all except
what he bought from Schultz, and Schultz had
only some 12 gallons which he obtained from the
derelict Higginbotham, and Higginbotham started
with five gallons, and Heaven only knows where
he got them originally, for wild horses would not
draw the secret from him. Consequently there is
a conundrum somewhere in the story, and the
Evening Nooze reader, who is weary with
puzzling out why Partces is like an Asiatic com-
positor driving a cart-load of meat, may try to
solve it if he feels so inclined,

Somehow when a good man goes into
politics his character always suffers. For instance
there was an election in Qheensland about a fort-
night ago, and a few days before the poll, as the
Government candidate was sitting peacefully in
his office thinking over things, a big, excited man
came in with a stick behind him, and asked him
it he was the blossom who was running this show
as the friend of the working man ? He was. And
“ wasn’t he the particular boojum who was going
to make this a white man’s country, and no more
darned coolies?” Just so. “Then what the
eternal thingammy have you got a splay-footed
old mud-head of a kanaka digging post-holes on
jour property for?’ yelped the big elector,
“What’s your game, anyhow?” and he gesticu-
lated wildly with tbe stick, but the candidate
never turned a hair and only said in a bewildered
sort of way, “ What ! Is there a kanaka digging
post-holes on my land ? ” and then he looked the
visitor sadly In the eye and waited for an explana-
tion; “Thar is. A darn, haggle-backed, bungs-
kunkated fon of an old Polynesian hen’s than’ a
takin’ the bread out of the mouths of us white
men. And when I arksed Mm for whom he was
a grafting the old cat-headed geyser sed you,” and
the voter stopped with his mouth open to await a
reply, while the candidate got up with his mouth
open, and feebly screamed out: “Me? Did the
wretch say me?” “Yes, you! I sez, ‘ Who’re
jou workln’ for, you old tobacconist’s image?’
and he sez, ‘ F6’ Miss’r Ashe, the liar; Miss’r
Ashe, that go to Parlyment bymeby, beat him
other fellow, you know. Miss’r Ashe, the liar, the
barristy, good fel'rMiss’x Ashe, he make it plenty,
good for kanaka gent bymeDy !’ That’s what lie-
said, boss. Fack ! And you call yourself the friendl
of the working man and hire this stag-footed old
executioner to dig post-holes for you. Come out-
side till I leather yon,” and the voter danced
round in a frenzy. But the candidate rose
idemnly and extended one hand and put the other
in his bosom, and spoke in sad, impressive accents
thus : “ This,” he said,” is a low, scurvy trick of
the Opposition to ruin my election. It is too had
altogether. The degraded mongrel shall be
ejected at once—if necessary with violence, and
the men who placed him to work on my property
will be called to account. My friend, calm your-
self.” And then the horny-handed elector re-
lented, and threw his knobby stick out of the
window, and cried: “ I thought you was straight.
I knowed you was. Gimme your paw again. I'll -
vote for you and so will all my pals,” and, after
shaking hands several times over, he fled down-
stairs and disappeared. And when he was gone
the candidate lay on the table and laughed till he
rolled off into the waste-paper-basket. But why
he did so was never explained, ard the hiring of
that kanaka is likely to remain a mystery till the
Day of Judgment.

such a fool as he looked, asked for an hour to
consider the proposal. After racking h's brains
for 50 minutes, an inspiration struck him—he
remembered his friend’s former position as bank-
manager ; went to (hat bank, enquired, and found
a balance of £42 to his credit, which had been
there three years unknown to him The cash was
immediately drawn, the black mailer despoiled of
his £lO commish , and now it s very dangerous
to ask this highly-respected citizen whether he
can “ put you on to making £4O for a slight con-
sideration !’’
The Earth, a London m mthly paper
whose mission ia to prove that this vale of tears is
flat and not round, is now almost the only sur-
viving souvenir of all the tommy-rot that has dis-

we think the Earth is quite an unnecessary pub-
lication, as the Jubilee, the Noose, the D.T,, the
Imperial Federation movement, Pastor Jefferis,
and the escaped Ayoub Khan are in themselves
quite sufficient proof that the earth is flat, and is
tenanted by flats as well. Besides, these old in
spired saints—Basi', Ambrose, Chrysostom, and
Augustine—all declared it to be flat, and they
ought to know, and what is more, we were once
acquainted with a man who crawled to the edge
and looked over. As far as we are concerned,
however, the shapa of the earth doesn’t matter
much, provided we can hang on and make a
decent living, and so far we have managed that
much, with an occasional lift from our inspired
un:le.
Chin Foo, although your ways are dark,

By hook or crook to “ get a bit ”
And die in good positions ;
And if they give away a pound

Engraved upon their granite.

And acting like believers do ;

The funds of the Primrose Ltague go to
pay the election expenses of the Tory boy-aristo-
crats.
M‘Eihone, M.L.A , legislated the other
night in the N.S.W. Assembly with only one
sock on.
The Salisbury Government are organising
an “ Intelligence ” Department. This will supply
a long- felt Tory want.
Parkes will now be able to proceed in an
absolutely disinterested spirit with his Insolvency
and Property Tax Bills.
One of the most important Freetrade in-
dustries in N.S.W. is the manufacture of Free-
trade articles for the country Press.
Secretary Sutherland pictures Parkes as a
slave to office. Not very far wrong. Sir ’Enry is
the sort of slave who loves to hug his chains.
AN.Z. paper wonders how any decent
man can be found to follow Parkes. The explana-
tion is that Parkes won’t follow any decent man.
“Is Parkes going to support the Austra-
lian South Pole expedition ?” It is quite plain he
doesn’t intend supporting a Sydney (South) poll
expedition.
The Bulletin repeats that there is only
one way to end the political difficulties of New
South Wales. Shave Premier Parkes, and the
rest is easy.
The business of the late Alderman James
Carey has fallen into able hands. The latest Irish
informer “ is a convicted thief, an army-deserter,
and a drunkard.”
Chamberlain proposes to promote the
cause of Liberal Unionism in Ulster. The latest
cablegram is that his tour is likely to create a
corner in sticking-plaster.
Close on a million workmen are out of
employment in Freetrade Britain. In other words,
England is supporting a million of foreign work-
men in preference to her own.
A Thames (N.Z.) elector nominated a
parliamentary candidate on the ground that “ He
was a gentleman who had qualities above the
human and the average kind.
Five million more letters are posted annu-
■illy in N S.W. than in Victoria. This is clearly
due to the persistent way in which the Free-
traders are dunned for their little accounts.
The latest jibe at the proposal to bestow
free railway passes on retired members of the
NSW Legislature is that some of the hon.
gentlemen’s parents enjoyed a similar privilege.
Attorney-General Wise says he never
reads Ihe Sydney Sunday Times. Now we come
to think of it, it would never do for a member of
the holy Parkes Ministry to work hard on the
Sawhath.
Says the Bundaherg Star (Q):-“ The
very first principle of democracy is co-operation ;
and this cannot exist between the feather-brained
delegate of an European monarch and the sturdy
toilers of this embryo Republic.”
A N S.W. up-conntry paper says that
Mud J. Haynes, M.P., is the “ Apostle of the
Interior —when he has a dish of ham and eggs be-
fore him.” We don’t wonder at this, for is he not
a disciple of the great Hi-Ham ?
The clients of the Prudential Life Assur-
ance Company, whom Parkes promised should be
paid in fall, are joyfully looking forward to a
dividend out of the Odico- Jemmy-promoted sub-
scription for the Kiama Ghost man.
Griffiths’ decentralisation will never do in
Queensland. If there’s half a million to the bad
with the wholesale plundering cf Northern re-
venues, how much deficit would there be with
only the Southern duties to play with ?
Speaker Young would, no doubt, be de-
lighted to give Mr. Tom Garrett half his salary if
he’d only let him alone. T. G. always rises osten-
sibly to support the Speaker, but the Chair fancies
it doesn’t want so much out-door relief.
“ I propose to allow myself to bo nomi-
nated,” said M. H. Davies, when he was dying to
be made Speaker of the Victorian Assembly. In
other words, M.H.D. might have said, “ I iatend,
sir, to allow myself to draw £l5OO a year and to
receive a K.C.M.G.-ship.”
In a recent letter, so says the Evening
News, Sir Henry Parkes described the Parlia-
ment of N.S.W., with doubtless a keen eye to the
mental capacity of his own colleagues, as a “num-
ber of babies.” Apropos, most of the babies in
Sydney seem to be for sale.
An indignant Melbourne elector proposes
that members of Parliament should be compelled
to travel in special railway carriages marked
“ For deadheads only.” Respectable people would
in this way avoid the risk which attaches to as-
sociating with bad company.
Said Premier Parkes the other night
“ I represent a great and living principle—
(Ministerial cheers)— a principle which is making
this colony the leader of the Australia?.” (Cheers.)
To what principle did the speaker allude ? To the
principle of chronic bankruptcy ?
The other day, Brother W. F. Schey,
M.L.A., addressing a suburban L.O.L , congratu-
lated them on the increased number of Orange-
men in the N.S.W. Parliament. Now we want
Brother Habigle to return thanks for the increase
in the loan-office and rabbit-peat.
The system of sitting only three instead of
four days in the N.S.W. Assembly has proved so
blessed a boon to the public that they are already
clamouring for an extension of it —the boon, not
the time. It might be well to try two days ere
long, and some are of opinion that one day per
week would be quite enough until after next
general election.
Edward Wilmot Pechey lifted himself up
and orated, at the opening of Pittsworth (Q)
railway, on the uselessness of keeping the public
lands for fu.ure generations to revel on. A local
scribe, who heard him, remarks that “he kept on
addressing posterity until some one, fearing that
he was going to keep on until bis audience arrived,
got him to shut down the valve.”
Major Atkinson, the head of the N.Z.
Administration, is a Protectionist. The Protec-
tionists carried 53 seats and tfce Freetraders 31,
the remaining 11 members being doubtful. This
is what the Sydney Freetrade Press exuPan’ ly
deicrites as a groat Freetrade victory.
During 1880 eight Engbsh trades’ unions
—the engineers, carpenters and joiners, steam-
engine-makers, the ircnl oueders, Lb" boiler-
makers, the pattern-makers, the blacksmiths, and
the London compositors—expended £213,937 to
keep their unemployed from starvation.
M’Guire, Major Atkinson’s opponent for
the Egmont (N.Z) electorate, declared at his
nomination that when he went to church the
priest who officiated, and whose face “was only
fit to win a prize at a dog-show,” denounced him,
and told the people not to vote for him.
Now that it is quite the thing to throw
water on that drowned social rat, Colonel Hughes-
Hallett, M.P., it is cabled that the clergymen of
his electorate have petitioned him to resign his
reat. That’s just the way. Trust the gentle
shepherd to kick a man when ho most needs
mercy.
Echo declares that Parkes has
never known the moment when some fcratch
party of Protectionists, partly recruited from his
own side of the House, might not trip him up.
There is, however, no danger from this source,
Parkes will avert it by turning around snd trip-
ping up Freetrade.
Mud J. Haynes is of opinion that one-half
the Opposition, “if they were where they ought
to be, would be in the dock.” Bat then, men are
not all where they ought to be ; if they wore,
some members would ba in the bath-tub at least
once a month. Ihe compositor will kindly put
this item under the heading “ Personal.”
Sir Julius Yogel let loose a little political
anecdote when addressing the Wellington elec-
tors. He said that on one occasion, when Major
Atkinson and Mr. John Bryce were travelling
together, the former received a telegram in
cypher from their mutual colleague Sir John
Hall The Major had left the key to his cypher
at home beside his corkscrew and other garden
THAT MEMORANDUM.
“As an example of special pleading, the memorandum submitted by Attorney-
General Wise to the N.S.W. Elections and Qualifications Committee would maintain
the reputation of a much older member of the profession, and should materially contri-
bute towards advancing that of a young barrister.”— E. News
tools, and he was compelled to request Mr, Bryce
to translate the despatch. Bryce did so, end the
message was : “Let me know what you are doing.
Look after Bryce. He is not to be trusted."
Iho Queensland sugar industry is getting
into rather a desperate state. What with Conti-
nental competition, Kanaka commissions, perpe-
tual official harassment, and the fall in the price
of sugar, Separation must come up there, and as a
Freetrade colony, the non-manufacturiug North
can get a good price for its sugar at Melbourne.
Stout’s defeat for Dunedin East, by a
majority of 29, was due to the opposition of the
local press, and the religious element-strongly
Presbyterian—combined with his connection with
Sir Julius Yogel anl his acceptance of a .title. It
is rumoured that he intends to enter into partner-
ship with a we 1-known legal firm in Melbourne.
The increasing demand for English capital
in connection with Australian ventures has its
had side for certain. Of course those who invest
the money will presently demand the control of it
to a more p ofltahle expenditure by employing
their own and similar countries’ pauper labour.
Then, Ilka Egypt the betrayed, and Ireland the
enslaved, Austral a may have her eyes opened.
The funniest sight seen in the N.S.W.
Assembly during Parkes’ apology for his latest in-
solvency was that of Alfred Allen, M.P., whose
misfortune it is that he looks like a diminutive
red headed caricature of the man with the mane.
Alfred was deeply affected at the well-calculated
snivelling of his master and fellow-poet, and gave
vent to his grief in tears as b’g as horse beans.
Sir Psalmyeli Griffith, the Queensland
Premier, following in the wake of the great
Hi-Ham of N S W., has interdicted the holding of
saored and classical concerts on Sunday evenings.
Psalmyeli being the son of a parson, and a
“ local” himself, naturally objects to any compe-
tition with the pulpit, even in ihe form of rational
entertainment which thj people are prepared to
pay for.
Not content with such titles as Knights,
Dames, and Companions, the Primrose League
soars into such high faintin’ names as *’ Knight
Commanders of the Grand Star,” “ Marshall of
the Grand Star,” See. The new decorations will
not surprise the Sydney league, one of whose
members, # at least, is already a Knight of the
Three Star.
In Henry George’s paper appears this
let ter ;
*• I am a barber and by persistently scraping faces I have
scraped together enough money to build a little house—not
one big enough to hold tenants, but with just room enough
f-r myself When 1 found 1 had money enough to build a
house, 1 began to look for some mud to build it on, ant I
went to a man for whom the Lord made lots at mud, but he
wanted such a price that I would have to mortgage my labour
for years to come. Ko I will have 1i wait until some fellow
patents some kind of a grappling hook by which I o in hang
ray house to the sky, hut I »m afraid the landowner under
neath will demand space or air ren v , claiming that I shut off
the sun and rain. In this case 111 have to wait till it rains
titles, and then perhaps I can grab one.”
Parkes may well exclaim ‘ ‘ Save me from
my friends,” many of whom, out of the fulness of
their sympathy, are crediting him with deeds
which he has never performed. The stale lie
about his being the founder of the existing N.S.W.
Education Act—the principles of which he warmly
denounced less than a month before the introduc-
tion of the measure—is again put into circulation
through the medium of the daily papers. People
are not to be bamboozled by such mierepresenta
tions, and the publication of them must have a
tendency to defeat the object which prompts it.
Mr. Oarruthers, M.P. for Canterbury
(N.S,W.) has got a big leg in for the £25,000 rabbit-
extermination prizes. His specific, confidentially
mentioned to a couple of dozen of his supporters
in “ public meeting ” at Ashfield assembled, is to
“ settle 600 or 700 men upon every square mile of
ths infested country.” There is billions of solid
sense in the suggestion. Not only would his pl9 n
kill the rabbits, but It would raise the population
of the colony to about 980,000 000, The advantage
of this course would be obvious. N.S.W. would
then he about twice as densely populated as Eng-
land or Belgium, and these teeming patriots of the
back block could, by changing their diet, easily
manage to exist. They would have to eat one
another, that’s all.
The Wh'ffler, a N.Z. humourist, has been
addressing the Blenheim electors. At one of his
meetings he requested those who had bought a
supply of sick eggs to remember that he was not
yet a sitting member. On being saluted with a
dead cat he said the elector who had attacked
him in such a pussinal way must be an unfeline
brute and full of pur-ity and spite. Could any of
the audience inform him why that dead Thomas
resembled Ba on Tennyson ? (Cries of “Yes!”
“No?” “We give it up,” &q) Well, he would
tell them. It was because it had lost its mews.
At this stage the audience had to sit down and go
to sleep. When .he awoke the lights were out,
and only the dead cat remained to hear the rest
of the speech.
As a closer of boot-uppers Frawncis
Habigle is justly famous, but as a mining Minis-
ter he is a remarkably unobtrusive potato indeed.
As an example of how much he doesn’t know on
this subject, he recently refused the application
of Mr. J. H. Harris, an old Western miner, for a
share of the prospecting vote, on the ground that
“ the area he proposed to prospect was too
limited.” It was only 150 square miles in all, but
Abigail, in the depth of his mineralogioal research,
fancies that 20 square miles a week is about the
area which an energetic digger should cover.
Perhaps some day, when an ex-micer is in power
and Abigail wants a subsidy in his boot trade, it
will be refused on the ground that he can’t make
150,000 pairs a day single handed, and then he
may begin to rea’iso the size of the joke which he
has perpetrated.
The decision of the N.S.W. Elections and
Qualifications Committee in the case of Attorney-
General Wise is not to be wondered at. The com-
mittee are directed by law to act according to
“ good conscience, apart from technicalities and
legal quibbles ” The majority of the m- mbers of
the committee being lawyers, their “ good con-
science” necessarily directed them to the verdict
that a lawyer’s fee is not an “ emolument,” and
that the acceptance of it is not an “ agreement"
in the ordinary or legal acceptation of the term.
The absurdity of this decision is shown by Mr.
Salomon’s case. He has a general retainer of
£2OOO a year from the Crown. The acceptance of
this binds him morally, if not legally, not to ap-
pear against the Crown. Could there be a more
distinct “ agreement ? ’ The clear duty of parlia-
ment is to see that the arrogant pretensions of the
wig-and-gown gentry are not upheld, and to pass
a Jaw abolishing the assumed privileges under
which barristers a r e at liberty not only to break
faith with private individuals, but also to wallow
unmolested in the mire of political crookedness.
THE AMBULANCE—A THOUGHT IN THE
SADDLE.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I have been in many a last-run race,
And have seen white splinters fly
From the panels struck—when each rider’s face
Is set, and his lips are dry ;
When the wind that blows from the heathery
heights
Comes not swifter nor more keen
Than the thundering hoofs of a field that fights
Where the stirrups flash and gleam—
When a man must ride with a head and nerve
That is cool and brave and stout,
As the gamest are apt to stop or swerve
If the jockey be in doubt,
For those who are horsemen know right well
That in spite of brag and talk,
When a fence is in front a horse can tell
If the rider means to baulk.
I know what it is, in a race half-run,
To feel the pull grow slack,
And to have to bustle a horse that’s done
At a panel too sound to crack—
When the foam that flies from his jaded lips
Is staining the silk with wet,
And his gallant blood each spur-head tips
With the hot and crimson sweat.
I've known in my time most that men can feel
Oa the flat, or over sticks,
When the whip-stung favourites sway and reel
Where the colours flash and mix.
But I tell you straight, though I’ve had my share
Of falls where death may be found,
For limb or life I had ne’er a care,
’Till my erffin raced me round.
’Twas my luck to ride the day that they first
Brought out the ghastly thing,
And I, as it happened, was up on the worst
Of mounts —on a brute named Sting,
A horse that I felt would give me a fall
Were the pace made slow or fast,
And who shied like the deuce at its dead white pall
As the waggon lumbered past.
To stand in the course like a grim, grey ghost,
Or a lean-limbed bird of prey,
Watching its victims who stood at the post—
Waiting to hear “ They’re away 1”
The flag went down, and I dashed to the front—
’Twas the only way he’d race,
For ’though he was slow at the heel of a hunt,
At first he’d a field outpace.
He went at his fence like one at a brook,
Altho’ it was stiff and sound ;
As he struck fore and aft, I chanced to look—
The waggon was rolling round.
God knows I had plenty to think of and do—
Sitting, and keeping him straight;
But, spite of myself, forever in view
Glittered the wheels of my fate.
So round and round, in a course of its own,
It waited and watched its prey—
So far, though the field had smaller grown,
Each jock had got clean away—
And, as we raced for the fence at the bend—
(The ambulance racing too),
I felt that with me it was “ bellows to mend,”
And somehow I fancied it knew.
Swaying and hungry it hurried across,
As though someone’s die was cast,
And so it was, for my mad-headed horse
“ Turned turtle” with me at last.
It carried me in, at least so they say,
This waggon ghastly and weird,
That had haunted a heart with dread that day,.
Which little before had feared.
Men boast of meeting and talking with death,
’Mid scenes of carnage and strife,
When their blood is up. and the battle’s breath
Has fired the calm of their life.
But I ask their best, could any man face
Grim doom under aspect worse,
Than when riding a three-mile steeplechase
In company with his hearse ?
KENNETH MACKAT.


THE MARTYR TREE.*
Right through Rs heart the fire's red teeth
Hal gnaw’d and torn their oinderous way ;
The sap still mounted from beneath,
Its tortured ribs to bind and stay.
And there the grani old tree remains.
In garniture of glistening leaves.
Rejoicing in the winds and rains ;
But o’er the past it never grieves.
And still it rears its martyr fora,
And still it wears its crown of green,
And still it braves the thunder-storm,
Though through its heart the fire has been.
*Verses (vide " The Beauteous Terrorist and other Poems ”
—Gteo. Robertson and 00., 1885) believed to have been
writti-n by Parkes, ®ho, if the author, was at the lime, as
usual, evidently thinking of himself. The stanzas are “ad-
dressed to a turpenrlue-tree on the Blue Mountains. The
bash-fires had burnt a hole through its giant trunk large
enough to admit fthe passage of a man; yet It was flourish-
ing in growth and oliage.”

The leading topic of conversation in
Sydney during the past week or two has been the
private affairs of Sir Henry Parkes. The N.S W.
Orange Lodges, &c., will now have an opportunity
of showing their regard in more than mere words
for their great protector, Sir ’Enry, by voting some
of their accumulated “yellow hoys” to the testi-
monial being got up for the Hi Ham. Popular
applause goes a long way, certainly, hut if you
want to test a man’s popularity, j ust get up a money
testimonial to him and judge by the result, this
reminds us that many years ago, when the present
generation were in long clothes, a money testi-
monial was got up for one Henry Parkes, a plain
man who owned a newspaper called the EiMpirb.
In a far Western town om high-minded gentle-
man —still living - collected £lOOO, and handed it
over on condition that the plain Mr. Parkes
should retire from politics, and attend to his
urgent private affairs. Mr. Parkes accepted the
coin in his own plain and prosaic way, but seems
only to have formally retired from politics on the
occasion—whether to the country’s loss or not
we are not prepared to say. The late Henry
Rotton, M.L.A., and John Dargin (still in the
■flesh) contributed one hundred pounds each to-
wards this particular thou !

Poor Lady Brassey ! She was a busy,
•pushing woman, who contrived to make a little
bit of brain go a long way. She toured round the
world in a yacht that was a cheap show at two-
and-six a visit, and got her name printed on the
title-pages of books which were written by Lord-
knows-who. But her work is only just beginning.
Away above the little stars that sparkle in the
blue dome of heaven, we think we see Lady
Brassey opening anew diary on “A Voyage in
Search of my Grandmother”—that mysterious an-
cestor whose picture (by Lawrence) provided the
subject for Miss Brassey’s costume at Lady Loch s
Jubilee balk The Bulletin jibbed at that there
old lady at the time. Truth has since confirmed
our suspicions touching her identity. And when
Lady B. has found a grandmother sufficiently like
the picture (by Lawrence) to swear by, she must
devote the rest of eternity to a search for the De
Bressis who came over with the Conqueror, and
planted a family tree for Lord Tom Brassay to sit
under. It’s pretty easy to buy along line of an-
cestors in this world, but when you have to col-
lect ’em all together in the next, then comes
trouble. .

Melbourne Age, deploring the fact that
Australian artists receive scant encouragemsnt,

only a replica ? *

Mayor Cain has decided not to accept a

were more in number than the hairs of his head.
The old man smiled sadly, and replied by a post-
card reminding his correspondent that early
piety had made him bald,

It seems queer, on the face of it, that the
late Hon. Billy Miles (Q ) who died worth £60,000,
should have left about 27 times as much to o*>e of
his daughters (and her children) as to the other,
whilst only £3OOO were devised to his widow.

The graceful curveting, the gcimhcuies, the
caracoling and circumfluent pirouettes of the agile
Sydney telegraph messenger astride his red ho .,
snorting steed, when a group cf pretty girls
is standing at the nearest adjacent street-corner,
with its aggregate of tender feminine heart all in
a flutter of sympathetic excitement, are weird
and wonderful things to contemplate. When the
horse capers and indulges in chamois-spasms,
there are women somewhere in the immediate
vicinity. Mount young Mercury Morse on a
bicycle and you have no particular display on the
part of the machinery, but then the youthful dis
seminator of electric lies would fluff his
stockings instead of his horse with bran, and
trade on calves in place of caracoles. Woman
“bosses” creation, even with the telegraph-
messenger, who, engaged in the hollowest sham-
and-fraud-circular in the world, ought to know a
thiog or two. But, to be practical—will some
hon. member please enquire how much per annum
is spent by the N.S.W. Government on horses for
telegraph messengers- and who gets the money ?

It appears from an advertisement on the
menu- card at a leading Sydney restaurant that
So-and-So’s champagne is “ very extensively
natronised by Her Gracious Majesty the Queen
and by Lord Carington,” Doesn’t this amount to
rank libel ?

It is awful to think of what may happen
to the Russians if they ever visit Queensland. The
Rockhampton Defence Force held a sham fight
the other Saturday night about three miles from
the town, and one whole company got lost in the
bush among the swamps, and never set eyes on
the others till they marched home at daylight
forlorn, draggled and covered with mud. They
had been fighting frogs and mosquitoes all night.

fidently asserted that nowhere in the world among 1500 girls

G. B. Allen, the composer (husband of
Alice May, the operatic prima donna who was in
Australia some 12 years ago) has recsntly returned
to Melbourne, and, above all other places on
earth, has settled down in Collingwcod. The
Fiat is becoming quite fashionable. His Honor
Judge Tommy Cope lives there now. Cue day at
the Yorick Club he propounded the following
conundrum to a large assemblage: “Where d’ye j
think I’m living now?” Bartrop said—aw!
“Toowackl” M'Kinley kindly suggested Pent-
ridge ; St. John Topp chimed in with the “New '
Temperance Township ” at Flemington; and the
Vagabond guessed “ Picturesque" Footscray.”

Anglicanism is at a low ebb in Bundaberg,
(Q.), judging from the touching appeal madebythe ;
tearful shepherd on a recent Sunday evening to
the stony-hearted congregation of his insolvent
tabernacle. The reverend gentleman stated,
inter alia, that on the evening of the preceding
Sabbath seventy coins had been deposited in the
collection-plate, of which coins no less than thirty-
four were threepenny bits, the devil’s own money,
while the largest representation of the image of
the Defender of the Faith was that graven on a
poor lonesome shilling. A sad state of things,
truly, to exist at the society church of so flourish-
ing a town as Bundaberg. Natheless the good
pastor’s appeal is considered rather a departure
from the doctrines of early Christianity. Yet do
the Bundaberg people require straight talk. They
have a most ungodly and assertive weakness for
free shows: even a first-class opera company
would perish there after the second night. So,
considering that they are thus economical in the
matter of amusement, it is nob wonderful that
they yearn for a free ticket to the Golden Shore.

The latest true story from Melbourne
ought to be keenly appreciated by the Australian
youth, one of whom (aged 16) left his situation
for a better one, but owing to some misconception
another lad had been taken on at the latter place
instead. The position was critical for him, and
alarming enough. What was he to do ? Suddenly
a magnlficent idea occurred to him. was still
early—he just walked over to the office of his
yesterday’s employer and answered his advertise-
ment. There was a sort of subtle exquisiteness
about this that was irresistible, and he succeeded.
For quick readiness of resource and sublime auda-
city this beats Bismarck in an innings with
several runs to spare.

lady Louisa Meux, the high-born dame
who met with a strange man on Calais pier and
went with him to a London hotel, where he robbed
her of her jewels, demanded (in colonial phrase)
a nobbier whilst giving evidence in a case heard
at Middlesex Sessions the other day. It was
promptly given to her, but it was too weak ; and,
with the approval of the presiding judge, she sent
for the bottle, from which she helped herself to
more. She then swore in a truly patrician man-
ner, as might have been expected. Mrs. Bill
Sikes would, perhaps, scarcely have been treated
with such delicate attention. But circumstances

The goddess of Yankee gush and {esthetic
spread-eagleism thus disports herself in an Ameri-
can journal re Mrs, Langtry's bedroom and some
of the things she wears therein :
"The carpet is dull white and thick enough to hush the
footsteps of an elephant, and over it all Turkish rugs, as rare
in pattern and texture as they are velvety and yielding. The
bedstead is brass, so slender as to appear hardly strong
enough to support a fairy, but it is firm and solid and wide
for all that, and capable of sustaining the Lily's weight
many times over. The bed is of unusual thickness, and
white as driven snow, the sheets and pillow-cases are linen,
and plain without ornaments of any kind, the quilt is lace,
lined with delicate pink satin and said to bo worth some
thousands of pounds. At the head of the bed, between the
windows, stands the toilet-table, and that defies description.
If you can imagine an orderly confusion of white lace, fine
enough to pinch a woman’s heart with envy and make her
mouth water, hair-brushes with gold and ivory backs and
handles, combs of silver, gold, ivory, tortoise-shell, and pearl;
heavily gold-mount d perfume-bottles, some of them a foot
high; hand-mirrors that dazzle to behold, hair-pins and
knick-knacks of all conceivable descriptions, until you have
to drop into the nearest chair and heave a sigh, so bewildering
is the profusion—you may have some idea of it, bat only an
idea. You could not approach the reality, short of a long
day s close examination There are no powders, no paints,
and no pencils, the perfumes are simply eau de Cologne and
lavender water. There are two easy chairs of different pat-
terns and a rather tall dressing chair and a pink and white
satin lounge, and in the farthest corner, between the ward-
robe and the door, a solid silver wash-stand with a gold-lined
silver bowl and pitcher. The nightgowns in the wardrobe are
of almost transparent lawn, white as purity itself, long and
loose, and cf a classic simplicity that might well fit a Venus
'new-lighted on a heaven-hissing hill,' Stacks of slippers,
boots, and shoes, heaps of hats, curious umbrellas, and
parasols, morning-gowns and wrappers, all scattered around
and filling up every nook and corner. On one side of the
bed-room is the dressing-room, on the other the bathroom.”
Oar bedroom, we may mention, isn’t anything
like that We generally sleep in an overcoat, and
put our hat on our feet to protect them from the
flie?, and then we tell the dog to go to Sheol, and
land with a dull, sickening thud on our stump
bedstead. As a matter of classic simplicity we
are prepared to gamble on this as being fully
equal to anything in the Jersey Lily’s wardrobe.

The colonies are making no provision in
their Anti-Chinese Bills for the free admission of
Chinkie parsons. One of the most gentlemanly-

Chinese priest of the Anglican faith; and some

English as a hopeless job. When he “ said Mass ”
on Sunday and had to announce, perhaps, that
“Next Thursday will be a day of fast and ab-
stinence,” he had to get this notice a week before
to study and rehearse. His Mongolian Reverence
need to teach the Gregorian music to the altar-
boys at the Melbourne Cathedral, but the young
wretches used to play up all kinds cf pranks in
class, and the only word of condemnation and
remonstrance in the vernacular which the almond-
eyed divine could master was. a forcible “ Hum-
hug When Patsy O Hooligan or young Tim
Fogarly became obnoxiously obstreperous, Father
Ah Lee would wave his arm wildly in space and ex-
claim in vehement protest, “Humbug! Hum-
bug I! Humbug 1! 1” Sometimes, when the
church choir was a bit florid, he used to tell them
they performed only “ smusementmoosick.” The
Rev. Joseph Ah Lae some time since returned to
China. If he’s not poleaxed by his heathen coun-
trymen, he’ll be poll-taxed when he comes back

The Auckland (N.Z.) papers don’t like
Amelia Barrett. They say she is a mean woman
who takes the bread out of the poor reporter's
mou h. Miss Barrett went amissing the other
day in the character of the maiden mid nodings
on ; she was seen one evening walking along a
lonely part of the shore, and next day her clothes
were found in a heap, and she had vanished with-
out a stitch upon her. Her boots and her stock-
ings, and so on, were neatly piled up
on the |sand, and there was a track where
two little bare white feet had trotted dawn to the
water’s edge—and then there was nothingness.
Amelia had apparently been swallowed up in the
abounding spaciousness of the far-off, and the
newspapers primed an item stating that her soul
had fled, and all the nsxt day the police dredged
for her end found nothing except the place where
she had been. This result, however, was not
surprising, as Amelia was pretty well, thank you,
all the time, only rather cold, and about as mad
as a nice girl with nothing on could be, and if she
had been a man she would probably have cursed
the officious officers for their interference. She
had been taking a short cut for home along the
beach, when her best hat blew off into the water,
and she had taken advantage of tte darkness and
loneliness to take off her clothes and go in after it.
Then the tide took both her and the hat, and when
at last she got out she didn’t know where she was
or where her clothes were, and felt very much
inclined to sit down and cry. All that night she
LADY BRASSEY.

and buried at sea.
'Rest for the striver in ignoble strife I
So skilfully she worked small social schemes
'That .after patient waiting, “ Brassey s wife
Saw the fulfilment of her early dreams,
And lived to place upon her throbbing brow
The dear-earned coronet—which bauble now
A vain reminder of vain glory seams.
The false “distinction,” won by weight of wealth,
Lives only for the winner s wasted day ;
For with the night comes mocking Death, by
stealth, .
To steal its treasures from the passive clay ;
No tinsel title can confer a fame
Beyond Death’s reach, nor money buy a name
Safe guarded in the nation s heart for aye.
Not e’en a monument of bold design
To mark, with pomp and circumstance, the spot
Where lies My Lady ! Still, the careless brine
Glideth a trackless way and telleth not—
Keeping its secret till, at summons dread,
Ths earth and ocean yield their hidden dead,
All, save a few, by all but God forgot.
Ye sycophants, who fawned upon her hand,
Murm’ring “ My Lady” with an envious sigh,
'The thickly-gilded great ones of the land
Are men as ye, the very hour they die ;
An earthly title, ’tis a worthless thing
In the immortal kingdom of that King
Who gives the stamp of true nobility.

There is a great rumpus in a certain

interesting domestic event which, pending details,
was held to necessitate the tjing-up of the hall-

that a mistake was made on the occasion, and
that the knocker aforesaid should have been tied
up with yellow kid. And thereby hangs a tale

social status and nationality of the offender, it is
quite unlikely that damages will be claimed from
the co respondent.

that Indians seem peculiarly its subjects.” Here

accepted by the capable Mr. William Owen, Q.C.,
ihe worst that can be said against whom is that
ha is a Primrose Leaguer. As Mr. Owen had a
splendid practice (worth say £6OOO or £7OOO a
ear), and was very fond of holidays, the Bar is
not a little surprised at h’s having accepted
£2600 par annum-or rather it would have been
surrrlsed did its members not know that his
Honor has a son who is a ba~rister, and whose in-

Sergeant Fenton, of the Yictoriarl Police
Force, who died the other day at Collingwocd;
w. ere he had been in charge of the station for
many years, was quite a character in his way. He
was one cf the fifty constables who came from the
London force in 1853, and did much to suppress
that dangerous creature known as (he Ceiling-
wood larrf kin The sergeant was “converted”
some years ago, and tried very hard to extend the
means of g~ace to the junior reporters of the Mel-
bourne dailies, who had occasion to see him pro-
fessionally, He was the author of some hymns—
more remarkable for their piety than their poetry
—and he used to presentpnnted copies of these to
the graceless young dogs who were in the habit
of interviewing him about the local inquests and
fires. The go: d seed thus sown may have taken
rot, but, so far as we are aware, none of it has
ever sprouted to the surface up to the present.
Amongst the gentlemen recently appointed
to the Commission of the Peace is Mr, John
Faoran. of Giro oar. Thisgentleman has a history.
Many years ago he was escort driver in the em-
ployment cf Cobb and Co between Orange and
Forbes. He was on the box seat in charge of the
ribbons on the eventful day when Francis Gar-
diaer and his gang stuck up the escort at the
rocks ne’r Eugowra 'I he gang obtained all the
go’d and deeamped, separating in various direc-
tors Most cf them, however, were afterwards
captured and paid heavy penalties. Fagan ex-
hibits a hat through which a bullet passed as the
identical one he wore on the eventful day. Mr.
Fagan was for many years host of the Royal Hotel,
Carciar, and Is now the owner of many broad
acres and fat flocks. He is a common-sense and
popular man, and delights at this distance of time
to tffil patient listeners how he made the pace at
the Eugawra rocks in the good old days of Gar-
diner and Co May the decisions of the new
fceak never be overruled,

“ Oakleigh trains ” took a good many people
to Caulfield on Saturdiy, but the railway porters’
straight tip fell on ears that heard not. The
horse wasn’t popular with the public, except a
select few from Ballarat, winch reminds us that
the goods things ef this life are never properly
distributed. Gorry brought up Oakleigh just
before reaching the fatal turn, and the race was
all over, bar shouting. There wasn't much
“shouting” either. Not many Caulfield Capa
have been drier than the last. Oakleigh’s owner
won £ll,OOO in bets.

Volcano seems to be one of the worst
stayers that ever carried the blue-and-white—sig-

finally won the Caulfield Cup in a canter—at the
wrong end.

Tranter, whose praises were sounded in
last week’s Bulletin, beat Pakeha nearly as
easily as Carlyon did, over the same mile. This
was Tranter’s first serious try, and his perform-

double—Derby and Cup.

In spite of the well-known fact that early
two-year-old form is more reliable than any other,
punters generally let Lady Betty alone for the
Nursery Handicap on Saturday. The same filly
was allowed to start at 20 to 1 before she ran a
dead-heat with Consequence, the preceding week.
Punters repeated their error out of sheer perver-
vity, seemingly.

The Sydney D.T. aquatic interviewer has
again been let loose. Last time Hanlan was in
Australia he interviewed the Canadian, who, see-
ing he had a raw hand to deal with, informed him
that the boat he was importing at the time was
2ft. 6in. deep aft. And that remarkable state-
ment appeared in next issue of the Rum. Ned
must have been at his old larks, for the D.T. on
Monday told its readers that Hantan’s new craft
had too much gamber, which would be useful
for a turn. They must have been giving the in-
terviewer a turn.

Oakleigh, winner of the Caulfield Cup, is
by Roodee, out of Adela. She started at 12 to 1,

stalled off a rush by Remus, and won comfortably

place a length behind Remus.

Henry Chick, a leading Tasmanian foot-
baller, has kicked the last goal of all. Ha caught
the Launceston Infection, and died from being put
into quarantine. But, take it altogether, we

fortunates who are examined twice a day for
“ spots” until they fly to the epidemic for relief.

George Fordham, who rode his first race
early in the “ fifties,” has gone to join poor Fred
Archer across the shining river. For a long series
of seasons Fordham headed the list of winning
jockeys in England, and the name of “ For-dam"
was reverenced by Frenchmen on their native
heath. Then Archer came along making records
that had never been dreamt of, and the cunning
little veteran was no more the mob's own idol.
About the time that he lost his first wife George
went in for such royal “ boozing” that he lost all his
nerve and a lot of his money. For months he was
actually afraid to get on a horse’s back, but sub-
sequently pulled himself together and got to work
again. It was after his second coming that Ford-
ham won his first and only Derby on Sir Bevys,
his luck in the Epsom race and the Doncaster St.
Leger having always been singularly out. Of late
he could not ride, and was, we believe, a pensioner
of Mr. Leopold Rothschild at the time of his
death. Stories by the yard will be spun by Eng-
"'folios W£ sen
. VHttf wt' com£ Oiii'
<1
lish sporting papers about Fordham’s past suc-
cesses and little follies. The story of Sabinus is
worth repeating. This horse, a tip-top public
performer, was tried for the Cambridgeshire
(Fordham in the saddle!, and apparently cut up
so indifferently that the stable didn’t fancy
his chance. But on the night before the
handicap, George looked upon the wine when it
was ruddy, and took 1000 to 30 Sabinus four or
five times. Next morning he sobered up, rode the
best race of his life, and brought Sabinus home a
short head in front of two dead-heaters. Then,
like a little fool, he let it get wind that the bets
he had made were so illegibly written down that
he wasn’t sure who laid them. Each bookmaker
in turn denied his liability, and few of the lookers-
on, who could have told something, would. How-
ever, evidence incriminating certain leading book-
makers was ready to be laid before the committee
of Tattersall’s, when Fordham funked making an
admission of having been incapable on the eve of
an important engagement, and preferred to let his
thousands go. As the owner of Sabinus had a
mere nothing on his horse, he was Inclined to
chuckle over the result of the jockey’s cleverness
in faking the trial. But as times go Fordham was
passing honest, and never deliberately pulled a
likely winner. May the turf lie lightly on his
grave. #
Bishop Barry has been lecturing at
Ballarat, on the English-speaking races. But he

A Queensland shearer writes to The
Bulletin, complaining that the travelling dele-

from the “walking gentleman” sorrow, also
from too little practice and too much theory.
Rev. J. G. Paton, heathen missionary,
publicly related, in Melbourne, the other day,
how some of the New Hebridean native Christians
who were threatened by the French, “ betook
themselves to prayer, and, in answer, at the last
moment, Jesus brought to their relief H.M. vessel
Swinger, which prevented the burning of the
villages, and no doubt great loss of life.” This
item reaches us, of course, per medium of that
godly paper, the Melbourne D.T. Its gorgeous
cant is nearly as funny as the Wesleyan Spec-
tator’s assertion that the Lord took a brief
against “ The Vagabond " in the late libel case.

rary literature of George the Fourth’s reign absolutely reeks
with the reflected impurity of his Court. Why not turn to
the records of the British Parliament alone, and read all the
evidence taken in connection with the Queen Consort's case j
You ask if one discreditable action can be laid at his door
upon other than Lady Hamilton’s evidence ? Not to men-
tion his numerous adulteries, his drunkenness, his want of
faith, his discreditable debts, and the general and habitual
effeminacy and lasciviency of his conduct, his cruel persecu-
tion of Queen Caroline, his attempt to suborn witnesses
against her, and his villainous behaviour to his unhappy wife
in the most trying circumstances of her life, brand him a
brute and a scoundrel through all the ages. As for
the sources, they are so many and so voluminous
that we have not space to mention them
‘ Ajax the Less’: Will probably use....‘Maidenly Modesty’:
Now, what are you giving us ?... .* Senex ’: “ Chinese Burg-
lar” undergoing examination....‘J.C.H.’ (Binelong): True

‘J.C.’: Idea too complex for representing in a cartoon....
‘ Henry Burton’ (Queensland): Received....‘William Gilles-
pie': What do you want to know, or is your letter a crypto-
gram Brown ’: The Chinese who compete on slave terms
makes slaves of us thereby no less than if they were the
slave-owners themselves. We hate them on that account,
for their slavery is voluntary; if they were forced, as are the
white men whom they injure, by Jingo greed, we might pity
them, but for self-degradation there can be no sympathy....
‘W.8.8.’: Froude’s historical veracity may be accurately
estimated by thestatements contained about Australia in his
“Oceana.”. ...‘William Maitland’: If the charges specifi-
cally made against Parkes in last isme of the Sunday
Times are untrue, th n ougnt the publisher be at oucj in-
dicted for criminal libel, and sent to gaol. If on the
other hand they are true, ihen ougnt Parkes be discarded tor
ever by all honorable men, and aoove all by tbe churches.
In any case, the action of those who denied a full hearing,
and a full report in tbe press, to M Namara, the workman
wno alleges that he has been cozened of his hard-earned
money, is one of the meanest and most dastardly suppres-
sions ever effected by the shoddy ring and the shoddy daily
newspapers, which in the past have, by their venal cowardly
silence, endorsed all sorts of crimes, from murder down. We
know nothing and say nothing as to the merits of
M’Namara’a accusations, but this do we say; If M‘Nam ara
lies, there is a criminal law to punish him for his slanders,
and there were present at the meeting a thousand witnesses
to hear him speak and to testify against him when he should
be placed in the dock. If Parkes does not prosecute his
slanderers criminally, the only conclusion possible will be
that N.S.W. is a community in which there is one rule
of conduct for the Premier and another for the public..,.
‘ C.O.W.’: You have our opinion to-day. Earliest Sup-
porter ’: You object to our caricatures of Jewish usurers on
the ground that they “ bring religion into ridicule and pro-
long the difference that everyone of refinement is so anxious
to see eraoicated.” What connection ought there be between
usury and religion? The Jewish usurer—we say it again—is
the deadly enemy of his own race. The Jew has a brain
which is far too good to be prostituted for money wrung out
of the necessities of his feilow-mau. Has the Bulletin
ever had anything to say against the Hebrew who was not a
usurer? Does it not fight the so-called Christians who grind
the faces of the poor—the cold-blooded, pious hypocrites who
pocket the money made out of human bone-dust ?....
fE. Morson’: The Sydney daily newspapers are too mean to
give the other side a hearing. They do not dare to publish
the anti-Parkes letters sent them by correspondents ; by
their old game, suppression, they would make it appear that
the community has not a word to say against Parkes. They
did not even fairly report Monday night s meeting at Sydney
Town Ha11....‘E. Clarke’: Vide Mining and Separation in

A DISCOVERY OF GREAT
VALUE.
The London Magazine of Chemistry and Medi-
cine, in a leader, publishes some of the most
remarkable facts in reference to the efficacy of a
marvellous discovery. The Magazine states that
eminent professional men in different parts of
Great Britain have, after the most thorough and
exhaustive tests, given it as their opinion that
this discovery is a positive cure for rheumatism
and kindred evils. Among other remarkable
cases they give that of one Edward Evans, in the
employ of Messrs Davey and Moore, the well-
known glass bottle manufacturers, who for twelve
years had hoen a fearful sufferer. He was treated
by some of the most eminent medical men, but
after treatment he was discharged as boing incur-
able. Ho next went to Paddington Infirmary,
where he remained no less than six years. From
there he went to Buxton Hospital, where he was
again pronounced incurable by the physicians, and
was eventually discharged. At that time his legs
and ankles were swollen to almost double their
size ; his hands also were so enlarged that he could
car cel y hold anything ; in fact, he was quite
helpless and was almost crazy with suffering.
Last June, at the suggestion of a friend, this
wonderful discovery, St, Jacobs Oil, was jjapplled,
according to directions, and in the course of a
weak the man was able to walk, and, for the first
time for twelve years, to have something like a
night’s rest. In a fortnight from the time of
using this Oil he regained the use of his limbs,
and has resumed work a cured man,
The Magazine, after citing other remarkable
cures, closes the loader by saying that it is not to
be wondered at that experiences like these should
arrest public attention, and become the subject of
extensive comment on the part of leading
journals. Manchester Athletic Nevis.
KEEP WATCH.
New South Welshmen. Your time is come.
Eternal vigilance must be your watchword. Keep
a .watch on every body. On your statesmen,
capitalists, clergymen, police, journalists. On
yours si ves, on everybody. It is of vital impor-
tance, and it must be done if you want to protect
your hearths and homes, if you want your children
to have a future. The watch is “ The Waterbary.’ l
It costs only 13s. 6d. It runs 28 hours with onl y
one winding. It regulates to a minute a month.
It ra’-ely gets out of order, and when it does can
be repaired at a nominal cost. Buy it. Try it.
Wear it. Take care of it. Or live to regret it.
THE PERVERSITY OF TASTE.
Nearly all fruits are pleasant to the taste, but
all are not eqally wholesome or nutritious. The
same remark applies to vegetables (provided they
are not grown by Chinamen), and almost every
individual has a decided fancy for some in pre-
ference to others. But with fruit and vegetables
alike, as with so many other comforts and luxuries
of life, there is an aggravating tendency on the
part of most people to hanker after those sorts
which are calculated to give them the most in-
ternal discouragement. Rarely does a medical
man prescribe just the description of diet the
patient yearns for. If a convalescent makes up
his mind that nothing but an under-done pork
chop or a Welsh rabbit will save him from a re-,
lapse, the doctor will be almost certain to pin his
professional reputation to diluted mutton broth or
thin arrowroot gruel. And in the matter of drink
the same exasperating contradictions are for ever
surrounding the conditions of daily life. The man
who thinks a lemon squash is the very best drink
known to fame is so constructed that he has either
to smother his inclinations ant drink rum or suffer
the most appalling agonies ; and the man who
prefers colonial beer to all other beverages has to
make a martyr of himself in favor of the squash,
because his clothes won’t stand the pressure to
the square inch which is engendered by beer, an cl
because his wife says his nose is such “a perfect
fright” that she positively will not be seen in the
street with him. For tbs benefit of any or all of
these Am may remark that there are iust two
genuinely pu'e drink?. One of those is spring
water, and the other, obviously, Clausen’s Cham-
pagne Lager Beer. The purity of the latter i s
established by analysis, and it is illustrated by
its taste, its sparkling brightness, and by the
wholesome, healthy, happy, and contented ap pe ar
ance f the people who drink it. This is no fable,
it is a matter-of-fact statement which can
be substantiated by application to any of
these well-known firms Messrs. Mason Bros ,
Limited, Fesq and Co , Tooth and Co., Allt aud
Co., Burrows and Glees on, Lucas B os., L

James James, negro, aged 136 years, of
Santa Rosa, Mexico, is said to be the oldest man
on earth. Let the oldest woman now step for-
ward, and declare she is over 28.
“ White is steadily going out of fashion
for wedding gowns,” gays a fashion writer,
“Quite the most poetic bridal dresses are now
made entirely of flowers." The most popular
flower will, no doubt, be the marigold.
A Wargaratta (Vic.) woman who suicided
last week was preached into a religious frenzy by
her father-in-law. The whirlgig of time brings
p s revenges. Hitherto it has been the husband
who was talked into frenzy by his mother-in law.
NEWSPAPER ART.
Slight caricatures of “faithful portraits of the winners of the A.J.C. Derby and the
Hawkesbury Handicap,” &c., according to the Down and GUMTREE JEENID, from
(alleged) photographs. Doubtless the photographs were all right, but we think we see
how it is. The Artist has run ’em through the mule machine by mistake.
An aristocratic English bride who had
come out without her gun received, among
other wedding presents, the head of a mummy in
a glass case and a Spanish dog eight inches long
and warranted not to grow any longer. The days
when the useful flat iron was presented to society
brides have long since passed away.
A hint to murderers. At Guanajuato
(Mexico) a merchant took to fooling round with
the brown-skinned darling of a soap manufac-
turer and soon afterwards he disappeared. That
was many years ago, and when he was gone the
soap-boiler married the brown-skinned girl, and
they lived happily together and brought up a
family and then at last he died, deeply regretted
by all who knew him. And on his death-bed he
confessed that he had boiled the merchant into
soap and thus he washed his bauds of his rival.
Germany has a surplus of 1,000,000
women. Now we know why she can't keep
quiet.
The wife of a labourer in Devonshire
(Eng.)—they're alwajs wives of labourers—has
given b rth to five children within a year after
her marriage—triplets first, and twins eleven
months afterwards ! Should olive branches con-
tinue to come to this prolific pair at the same rate,
they will have a r ound them at their silver
wedding a family of 125.
From an English paper : —“ It is hard to
help feeling that drink must be one of the causes
of Irish poverty. There are 26,000,000 of persons
in England and Wales, aad 5,000,000 in Irc’and ;
but folly half a« many persons are convicted of
drunkenness in Ireland in a year as in the whole
of England and Wales. In other words, if we
allow for the disparity in population, we will find
that there are about 230 drunkards in Ireland for
every ICO in England.” Fearful—but what then 2
We were speaking on this very subject to an
Irishman freffi from home not long ago. “I
know it’s bad,” he said, “ but if you wor to see
the state of things in Oirland just now, maybe ye
wouldn’t blame us. By , sir ’’—and in his
excitement he struck an iron fist with a palm the
si:;e of a bread-plate—“ we have to get dhrunk to
stand it.”
THE INNOCENT BARMAID.
A gentleman was yesterday seen entering the
private bar of a hotel in King-street just about
lunch time whose face was full, and so was his
body. He was a member of Parliament, so say the
whispers, and had a face on him calculated to
make a barmaid tremble.
“Looking up information against Sir Henry,
I presume?” said the dear Miss Alice, whose face
was full of congenial smiles.
“Oh, yes; do you know anything?" said the
member.
“ Well, to be plain—by the way, what is your
drink? You look as if you were anx'ous for
something. Ginger beer, soda, or that famous
ST. LOUIS LA.GER BEER? They are all tem-
perance drinks?”
“ST. LOUIS, please. Now, come—tell me all
you know about Sir Henry."
“ We’l, the fact is all you cantankerous mem-
bers must be careful wbat you say about him.
I heard only a few minutes ago that Sir Henry
had a thoroughly trained bull pup in his back
yard, and was going to invite all the members
who had insulted him the other evening to a cold
collation. The dog is not to bo seen until he is
sure of his visitor, and is afterwards to bo sent to
Queanbeyan for a meal.”
“By Jove! that is valuable information. I
have been invited. What is to become of the
pup ? ”
“ Oh! his bide will go to the Upper Hunter to be
sold to the highest bidder. Hush ! don't talk so
loud,” said dear Miss Alice. “ See that man
near the door with the big ears ? " “I wonder if
he heard you ? ” said the member. “ If he could
not hear you with those ears he ought to take
them in.” And thar, is what a few of the mem-
bers are trying to do with the public. Another
glass of that famous ST. LOUIS BEER,
please. I stop at home,”

The ‘POTSHOT’ Camera
IS the Latest Novelty in the Photographic World, It is small, strong, very simple, handsomely got
up, and atrociously effective both on friends and on enemies. Six circular pictures, each about the
size of a crown piece, can be taken on one plate with most astonishing speed and perfect accuracy.
This Camera can be worn under a coat or dress, the lens projecting through a button-hole cannot be
observed, and the simple action of pulling a cord hands down to either reverence or ridicule every
incident included wi'hin the scope of its vision. The “POTSHOT” Camera is not a toy, but a
really serviceable instrument of the c’ass known as “ DETECTIVE ” Cameras. At the same time
an immense amount of fun can bs got out of it, and photographs of people and things obtained with
ease which are pract’oally impossible by any other method. A limited number only have been
imported by us, and they are well worth the attention of the general public.

The Rev. Dowie, of Melbourne, who does
faith-healing in job lots, is down on sport like a
thousand of bricks. He finds, by referring to the
Scriptures, that betting Is characteristic of the
Jewish race, and he proceeds to slang them up
hill and across country in consequence. He for-
gets that the same high authority warns us to
bear ourselves humbly and lowly towards our
betters.
"Editor Bttlletik. —In a late Issue you
have under notice “Wolseley’s Shearing Machine,"
wherein you state that “ any station hand,
ronseabout, or jimmygrunt, may use the machine.’'
Well, they may use the machine, but not properly.
No, sir—none bnt a skilful hand can nse it effec-
tively. No one can shear a sheep unless he
knows how to hold a sheep, and if you do not
know how to hold a sheep properly you can never
shear a sheep ei her with machine or shears. It
will always require the same number of shearers
as hitherto. The shearers will not suffer by it,
but the squatters will gain—not that they will get
their sheep shorn any better, but they may get a
better staple of wool out.— Practical Shearer,
Seymour, Yio., 12th Oct.
Apropos of the loss of the Derry Castle,
and the experiences of the survivors while sub-
sisting on clams on a desert isle, it may be men-
tioned that Australia can boast of the best ship-
wreck on record. In October, 1829, the Mermaid
was lost in Torres Straits, and the crew were
picked up by the Swiftsure, which sank three
days afterwards. The two crews were saved by
the Governor Ready, and, after being six months
at sea, their vessel foundered, and the three crews
took to the boats and were picked up by the
Comet, which struck on a reef and went down to
the kingdom of David Jones. Then the Jupiter
discovered four crows drifting about and took
them on board, and when she sank at the entrance
of Port Raffles Harbour the five crews got safely
ashore. If any other country can beat this record
without lying we shall be glad to hear from it.
The formation of companies with capitals
of a cool million appears to be Queensland’s pre-
sent fashion of publi hing her prosperity, and tell-
ing the world she isn’t dead-broke. M rant Morgan
commenced the little game a year ago, and the
confiding public testify to the modesty of the pro-
prietors by accepting its present value at eight
millions of pounds sterling ! (It will take “ a
power” of dividends to repay to the confiding
public its principal and interest.) Then came the
Extended Mount Morgan, who are going to pierce
the bowels of the earth in search, of a lode.
Capital, a million—subscribed for several times
over. Then Tarangamba is put on the market for
the aforesaid cool million; and now we are
credibly informed that the owners of that strange
mine at Ravenswaod—full of every mineral under
the sun—is to be floated for a similar amount.
The Age says Parkes should resign.
The greatest and most profound statesman
of this or any other age, was, till a few nights
ago, considered by all competent judges to be Mr.
Duncan, member of the Victorian Legislative
Assembly. He sat in his place and said nothing-
said it with a look of sublime conviction—an air
of Sphinx-like solemnity, the parallel of which
has seldom or, perhaps, never been seen since the
days when Harpocrates was worshipped as God of
Silence. Gazing on him one felt at once the grand
veracity of those lines, from an old poet, quoted
by Charles Lamb: —
“ Still born silence ! Thou that art
Floodgate of the deeper heart.
Frost o’ the mouth, than o’ the m'nd." &o.
But all that, and with it all the belief in a vast
reservoir of silent wisdom, was swept away as the
dead leaves by the winds of autumn, or a cloud
of flies by the rail of a poley cow in the sultry
summer, when be opened his mouth and “ began
for to speak.” This Is what he said" Mr.
Speaker, I have come in in the middle of a dis-
cussion, and I don't know what it’s all about, nor
how there should be such warmth displayed. But
I will say. and I say it as a duty to my constitu-
ents (Qaunson: Who constitutes you ?) I will say
(Gaunson; You will I (blandly) what are you
going to say ?) Mr. Duncan sat down. This is
all about the greatest and most profound states-
man of any other age.
The editor of a Melbourne weekly advises
“ Bes*" to write of things round about her. We
are looking forward to an interesting posm on
