Versus by Edgar Lee Masters
Skip Seoe Loves.
You're the cook’s undevsiudg.
A gentle idiot body. j_
You araslendcr like a bream
Weaving up end down IM ream,
With your dirty no if in a twist
And your left eye i:i~ s mist.
Never tkinkin', never hopin'
With your wet mouth open.
So bewildered and so busy
As you scrape the dirty kettles,
O Slip Shoe Lizzie,
As you rattle %citk the pans.
There's a clatter of old metals,
O Slip Shoe Lovcy,
As yon clean the milkcans.
You're a greasy little dovey,
A laughing scullery daughter,
As you slop the dish water,
So abstracted and so dizzy.
O Slip Shoe Lizzie !
So m ussy, little hussie,
With the china that you break,
And the kitchen in a smear
When the bread is yet to bake,
And the market things are here —
O Slip Shoe Lovey!
You are hurrying and scurrying
From the sink to the oven,
So forgetful and so sloven.
Tom ere bustling and hustling
From the pantry to the door,
With your shoe-strings on the floor.
And your apron-strings c-draggin’,
And pour spattered skirt a-saggin’.
You’re or. angel idiot lovey,
One forgives you all this clatter
Washing dishes, beating batter.
But there's another matter
As you dream above the sink:
To i're in love, pitter-patter,
With the butcher-boy, I think.
And he’ll get you, he has got you
If he hasn't got you yet.
For he means to make you his,
O Slip Shoe Liz.
And your open mouth is wet
To a little lo;.ish chaffer.
You’re an easy thing to flatter
With your hank of kair a-twist,
And your left eye ir; a mist —
O Slip Shoe Lovey!
So hurried and so flurried
And just a little worried
You lean about the room.
Like a mop. like a broom.
O Slip Shoe Lovey!
O Slip Shoe Lovey!
Malachy Deg an.
Ualachu. you stand a referee to fudge.
Under a torrent of blue light,
The naked pugilists who fight,
Grim faces with a smudge
Of blood, or on the sliding arms or hacks.
Th- e on the platform roped, in palls
Of smoke to tke roof of Tatiersaus.
And where the iterant cracks
Of matches struck for lights prick *hrovgh
the fej,m
Of voices oteriGned by cries
Of “Finish kim, n “Look at his glassy
eyes,”
“That sounded like a dr bps.”
Wien the timekeepers gong went clang!

A* d a hush came over us. as then
Bath robes slipped off. the fighting men
Out of their corners sprang.
And in between the tangled arms and legs,
And e&BCkes iriici you break, you glide
Red-haitxd. athletic, wrathful eged.
And like a lager keg's
Round fullness is your chest, yaw arms all
bare,
Coatlcs i. a fig*re memorable.
You should not be forgotten—well
And if it be to dare
The censure of a taste American
To celebrate your courage, wit.
I write you down what here is writ:
A referee, a can.'
A judge who loved the game and whose
decree
Had ro taint on it. was more pure
Than most of our judicature.
Of every knavery free.
And what is here to shock or shake such
nerves
As children's art. delicate women's?
There goes the short hook of Fitzsimmons.
And Thorne a moment swerves.
Then topples over, and lies quiet while
You const from one slowly to nine.
And Thome lies there without a sign
Of Ufa, but with a smile.
After a time gets up. and reels across
The ring to his own corner, them
Flops wobbly in his comer’s choir.
And wonders at his los*.
While full ten thousand cheer, and watch
you shake
The master hand, the genercl’s—
Suck was our sport at Tatter**!!t
Before the Puritan rate
Combed through the city. Vote the sport is
dead.
And you are dust these several years.
And tee tcho drift to stale careers,
And live along and tread
The old deserted ways we loved and knew,
Ask sometimes how it teas a cough
Could seize upon you, take you off —
A lad as strong as youf
From “The Great Valley.”
•
He’s a dull dog, Edgar Lee Masters,
author of Spoon River Anthology and now of
The Great Valley (Laurie, London). He is
still desecrating graveyards and disinterring
corpses, but he no longer disdains to 'write
of anybody alife or to use rime and metre.
Sometimes he is almost Browning, and some-
times he is nearly “Bellerive”; occasionally
he is Whitman, but more often he is merely
Edgar Lee Masters. Thus: —
’Twirt certain parallels of latitude;
Say 87 and 42 and more;
And certain meridians, say 91
And 87 plus.
This is not a problem in algebra, but the
beginning of a poem. He ends another poem
thus: —-
And there across the street
Was crape upon the door —our man was
dead,
And I was carrtting chicken home to boil.
In another he tells us: —
1 drove to Oakland
With Dr. Green and William Smoot the
grocer.
Bat nothing he has done in this enrious col-
lection equals for stark realism a chaste
poem entitled “Steam Shovel Cut.” It is
the story of the death of Cora Williams, who
had been drinking gin and beer, and who
was found under the trestle railway bridge,
dead with a green bruise on her back. Croak
Carless was with her on the bridge, and is
wrongfully suspected of murder: —
Croak Carless' wife weeps at the bars,
Croak weeps in a grated cell,
They've mortgaged the farm for a lawyer’s
fee
To save Croak’s soul from hell.
For the Coroner has a bat-like thing
In a bottle safe in his room,
It looks like a baby devil-fish —
It’s Cora Williams’ womb.
In jiggity rhythm, in two-step time, the
American “Bellerive” farther describes the
subject of the List verse, and then: —
They sprang tke trap. Croak Carless shot
Like a wheat-bag toward the floor,
And the doctors let his body hang
Till his old heart beat no more. ...
And he might have died in bed in a year.
For when they opened him up
They found his heart was a played-out pump,
And leaked like a rusty cup. '
The amazing thing is that Edgar Lee Mas-
ters, capable of achieving a masterpiece like
this, should here and there in this volume
sick to levels of mere poetry, original
thought and brilliant psychology. But
despite this persistent vein of poetry running
through his rugged and contorted prose, this
page thinks that Edgar Lee Masters is wast-
ing his time: he ought to be writing text-
books on algebra, or contributinc to our
“Answers to Correspondents” column.
The second number of Arf in Australia ,
edited by Sydney Ure Smith. Bertram
Stevens and C- Lloyd Jones, is now issued
by Angus and Robertson. Sydney 1 The
high artistic standard of the initial number
is more than maintained; and a wide range
of the work of Australian artists is illus-
trated in color. The editors call attention to
the admission by Howard Hinton that it was
the Hi’der article in the first issue that in-
duced him to present to the X.S.W, Gallery
the valuable collection, illustrating the whole
course o: that artist’s development—an omis-
sion by the Trustees that says little for the
acumen and artmie judgment of those gen-
tlemen. The present volume includes recol-
lections of Boeder; an appreciation by
Lionel Lindsay of Streeton’s place in our
art: analyses of the work of Hans Hevsen.

A New Australian Author
A relative of the anonymous author of
The Coo-ee Contingent , recently highly
praised by this page, disclose- the unexpected
facts that this new Australian author is a
woman, and that tbie is this Melbourne girl *
first essay in publishing: —
“There was one good reason for publish-
ing The Coo-ee Contingent without the
author’s name, and that was because it was
written by a girl graduate of the Melbourne
University, still in the twenties. To p Alien
a war book in a girl’s name was to asK the
reviewers to turn it down without reading it.
There is no reason why your curiosity should
not be satisfied.
“The writer is Gladys Taylor, M.A., LL.ti.
(Mrs. R. E. Hain), who was for some years
a practising solicitor in Melbourne. Her
husband is a Melbourne barrister, an officer
of the Citizen Forces, who volunteered a. 3
soon as war broke out. He was in Broad-
meadows Camp, in charge of what he called
Z Company, for some months, where ae came
into contact with most of the queer ns,, of
the camp, and went to the Front with toe
23rd Battalion of the 6th Brigade, m May,
3915. He has served on ail the fronts, and
is now on the Headquarters Court-Martial at
Tidwcrth, more or less knocked about. He
married Miss Taylor when on final leave, and
she went to London in May. 1916> Since then
she has been in the centre of the Australians
in London, and at Tidworth (Salisbury
Plains). What stories are not from her
husband are the experiences of Dr. Percy
Lyttle, of Wyalong. X.S.W. (her brother-in-
law), who did his surgery in the front
trenches at Pozieres, until a shrapnel shell
caught him and smashed his right arm. His
companion, ‘Bates/ of the Galilee story had
hi 3 leg smashed by the same shell.
“The virtue of the author of The Coo-ee
Contingent is that she has told the boys’
stories as they have been told to her. They
are real stories, truly told, and that is why
they ring true. What are not from her own
two men are from the many visit rs who
naturally drift to her Sat, boys, mostly, who
went through the ’Varsity with her.
“ "They came to afternoon tea,* she writes
of two of them, now proudly wearing Mili-
tary Crosses, ‘and they were not hard to per-
suade to 3tay to supper/ Once when she
suggested to her husband that she was get-
ting short of copy, and was tempted to use
her imagination, she got an imperative let-
ter. written from in front of Baupaume:—
‘Don’t you do any faking. There are plenty
of real stories for you!’—so she wisely
waited. Just now she is settled in the Manor
House at Tidwcrth, a friendly Australian
spirit m touch with all her old chums. That
is why she writes with such knowledge.
“As to her literary experience, it is com-
prised in the four years when, both at the
’Varsity, her husband was editor of the
Melbourne University Magazine, in the
days when the Professorial Board lay awake
o' nights, wondering what was going to be
published next. It generally scandalised the
Chancellor and President by much plain
speech ahont Professors. Gladys is doing
well, well cared for by her husband’s rela-
tives in Cornwall, and eager to make Aus-
tralia known abroad.”
J as. Ashton, of Adelaide, explains: Re
your criticism of the book. Art of tke British
Empire Overseas. My son Will happened
to be in England at the time I was written
to by the editor of The Studio for an
article, as I had done so before. He was
asked for a picture to be reproduced in
color. I had nothing to do with the selec-
tion of the photographs I wrote to Mr.
Heysen asking him to send me some work for
this article, but he did not do so. I could
not write to Mr. Street on, he being in Eng-
land. The article was intended for tile
painters now resident in Australia, not those
who have resided in England for so many
years and become English artists: bat in
writing I did not ferge: those men who had
done so much for art in Australia. I might
say I did not send any photographs or write
to the following, whose work was repro-
duced: Miss. R. Southerland. Messrs. Rich-
ardson. MoClintock. Officer. Brown. Raker
and Anderson. You will see I did my best.
Walter J. Price asserts that Challis
V. Jervis -Red Page. 19 T/T7l is
wrong in stating that Leon Gellert is &
teacher at the Norwood State School, and,
incidentally, no lover of games. "As a
contemporary at the ‘Varsity, as a member
of the same battalion of the A.1.F., and as
- .s particular auta and constant corneani on,
I know Leon Gellert to be an excellent
amateur boxer, as an oarsmln considered
good enough to represent the ’V.ir sitv in
1 iub races, stiu a splendid tennis-player.
But bus forte is physical culture, and
Jus development of muscle is extraordinarT.
That brings me back to Challis V. Jerri Vs
error as to his occupation. Leon Gellert is
“ftructor of physical-training at State
schools in the metropolitan area. A better
pal no man could wish for. a lover of chi’-
dren, generous to a degree, witty and humor-
or.s, arc. a hr./taut raconteur."

of m- rnativity. “If he (shall) have’ the
money to-morrow” is correct, because the
L;: otcetica, element is introduced: but this
in one of the cases in which the indicative
form is preferable, because the most accented
English steers carefully clear of anythin*
that suggests the nltra-academic. The Red
Page is right in saying that modern ten
dency discourages meticulous solicitude for
the subjunctive. Indeed, it has gradually
become evident that conditional nrefiyl
such as “if,” “though.” “whether.” and so
on, do not necessarily involve the use of
that mood. It appears to me, nevertheless
that the indicative cannot properly be used
in the case cited by your correspondent I
cannot see that any purpose of convenience
is to be served by confounding with oue
another the clearly separated significations
of. for instance: “If be tea* there” (past) •
If he were (to be) there” (hypothetical)-
“If he is there” (present): “If he (shall)
be there” (future).

Yet he says his thoughts are full of faulty
grammar and irrelevancies. He also wants
to know why leader-writers don’t write as
they think. Well, why doesn’t “Copabella”?

tx would be if he did I
He also gibes at the English taught in
Australian State Schrols.. If he examines
20 original essays from individual children
ranging in age from eight to 14 he will
discover that children come nearer his ideal,
“to write ss one thinks.” than adults do;
and the first thing he will want to do will be
to correct the involved sentences, to cut oat
the irrelevant matter and the excessive num-
ber of "ones." and to place sentences first
that have been written last —just as the
t-acher does. And why? Because literary
English has always been, and always will be,
different from spoken English.

When one shire councillor SDeaks the

who drew the interjection is either keeping
two homes ;r is in the habit of making false

have it whispered in pubs and chorch gather-
ings that he is a wife-beater.”
'The New East is the title of a new
monthly published at Tokyo. Japan, edited
by J. W. Robertson Scott 50 sen). It aims
at interpreting the West and the East to
each other and “develcpinc the good relations
new existing between Japan and Great
Britain." It is therefore printed both id
Japanese and in English. The New East
doesn’t seem to have anything very new to
say. hut of course it is unfair to judge such
a rn&gaaiae by its first number. The con-
tents are varied and scrappy. And the title
annoys: the place that modestly calls itself

Chloraco Tooth Paste is distinguished for

Chlorate compound. Chlorates, it has been
stated in the Pharmaceutical Codex, give up
oxygen to the tissues, and it is largely on this
account that they have received wide employ-
ment in foul conditions of the month and
pharynx. Chlorates are used as a wash for the
mouth when the gums are inflamed and
spongy. 'The name Chloraco has been adopted
as a specific title and trade mark to prevent
unscrupulous persons deceiving the public with
preparations containing no Chlorates at all.

reason why you should
buy a reliable make. The
reputation of Winchester

you. They are always

Sleeping Out.
Wailing comes the south breeze, heralding
the gale;
The awning on my balcony is cracking like
a sail—
Cracking like a topsail, while beneath the
din
My heart is singing to the tune of “No, L
won’t go in!”
Wliite-maned horses gallop in the bay be-
neath ;
The trumpet-blast has maddened them, the
bit’s between their teeth;
Now the rain has caught them with a whip-
lash hiss—
And who would shut themselves away from
pageantry like this?
Watching drowsy-warm ’twixt ranked ver-
andah-bars,
The charging massed cloud-cavalry come blot-
ting out the stars,
Streaming manes and pennons sweep across
the sky.
I ponder “Some would rather sleep, perhaps,
but never 11”
Just beyond the rain’s reach, so I wait what
comes,
To shrieking bugle-blasts of wind and thun-
der’s roiling drums,
Purring in my white bed. huddled soft and
warm,
While on the whole horizon flares the splen-
dour of the storm.
N.S.W.
DOROTHEA MACKELLAR.
Only Sir Galahad.
What time the embers of heroic men
Flamed to the pallid peaks of Paradise,
I, waiting at Enmishpali, saw again
The Grail of God’s most holy sacrifice.
Through blazing arrows of the red, red
morn.
Faint with the fragrance of the lips of
Christ,
It floated forward like a star new-born ;
And lo! I followed, for the scent sufficed.
O’er dumb-tongued battlefields it upward
sailed,
Tulsed with the passion of a maiden vow,
And gleamed where poppies, airily unveiled,
Bloomed in the skulls of souls forgotten
now:
Bloomed in the valley where the Anzacs
sleep
’Neath scented coppices of deep content;
In khaki shrouds 'which holy angels keep
Sacred for drapings of Jehovah’s tent.
Mounting the higher amber of the air
Now like an acolyte it trembled by,
Onward o’er Tuscany, through meadows fair
Forth to Louvain. I heard a woman cry.
Through Flanders filmily it led me on
Where Hope hid cowed in every tangled
lane;
Art lie a-raped, her chastity was gone,
Slain in the futile carnages of pain.
Rut none save mothers with their babes
abreast
Pouring devotion through their sleepless
eyes,
Flecked with reflection of the radiant west
Saw the bright Grail an instant in the
skies.
None but a soldier dying in his woe
Facing the blinding battlements of Death
Softened, and, smiling pity for his foe,
Felt the pure glory of the Saviour’s
breath.
Then unto Calvary it soared and stayed.
There, too, I waited while the world
roared red,
Bloodied with battle and with pain decayed
Heaped to the summit with its piles of
dead.
“Friends, drink,” I cried, “the cup of your
relief.”
They heeded not, but shattered hill and vale ;
Till Christ bent down and whispered
through His grief:
“Still none but you have found my Holy
Grail.”

ZORA CROSS.
Nonsense Immortal.
From France or Spain or the Himalayas,
Out of the hearts of unknown loons,
In toothless mouths of old soothsayers,
On hairy lips of wandering players,
Come the lullabies, come the croons.
Lords have lashed and poets have pondered,
Blood has flowed in the runnels deep,
Beacons have broken and faith been squan-
dered ;
Through dark forests these songs have wan-
dered
Quietly crooning the babes to sleep.
Grandmother melodies, grandmother fancies,
Crooned by the Oxus ever endure!
Epics of valor and throne-romances
Have much honor and take big chances.
But the clowns who sang for the babes
are sure.
The goblin speaks wdiile in old caves moulder
Priest-made destinies, Lord-made law;
The goblin leered from the monarch’s shoul-
der
And, his sight being true and his young heart
bolder,
’Twas only the goblin the baby saw!
So the gods’ death-throes are baby chatter!
A ball on the floor of the nursery room.
The red earth rolls, for what can matter
If old John Spratt licks clean his platter
And the brown cows go to the broom?

A STATE WHOSE CITIZENS MAKE
WAR ON THEMSELVES.
The idea that merely because a public ser-
vice or industrial enterprise is run by the
State, the community therefore stands in-
sured against the grosser abuses arising
from conflicts between employers and
employees, or that it even has protection
against the undertaking being used to
extract an extortionate toll from the
general body of citizens, might just as well
be dropped overboard. Australian experi-
ence has shown it to be hopelessly wrong.
Wherever and whatever the secret of public-
management may be, this country has cer-
tainly not yet discovered the first thing
about reconciling the practice with the theory
of the business. In every State and in
the Commonwealth field of activities there
are dreadful examples of how much ineffici-
ency public authority can commit and a suf-
fering people endure. Raids upon the
national income and credit to subsidise
muddle are continual. The economic effect
of this filibustering is just as disastrous
as if Private Enterprise was raiding the
citizen’s pocket for profits —possibly more
so, for the citizen could hit back at Private
Enterprise by forcing it to disgorge some of
the loot in the way of taxes. Under exist-
ing conditions the citizen has to do the dis-
gorging himself. Moreover, strikes on
public services have been relatively as
numerous as elsewhere, and there is room
for suspicion that they would have been
more plentiful if the politician had not been
able to get in some fine work at the back
door. Mostly this fine work consisted of
using the public money to purchase peace
and quietness (and incidentally votes) at a
price which made uproar and confusion cer-
tain later on. There have been dozens of
flagrant instances of this in recent years,
and one of the direct consequences thereof
is the strike the N. S. Wales Government
found itself tangled in when the employees
in the rail and tramway workshops downed
tools last week. To say that the men in this
particular case are hopelessly wrong is only
to draw attention to a minor detail. The
ground they have chosen for a quarrel is fan-
tastic. The only thing they succeeded in
proving beyond the possibility of further
argument was that, by prolonged prostitu-
tion of a social and economic experiment to
the exigencies of a dilapidated political sys-
tem. the public may have built up against
itself a tyranny just as brutal as the one it
was supposed to have muzzled. Towards
public enterprise in Australia the attitude
of Parliament has always been that of an
institution without sense of responsibility,
except so far as responsibility could be inter-
preted by individual politicians in terms of
party votes. And the evil example of Par-
liaments and Ministries has been reflected
in a plentiful absence of the sense of public
responsibility in other places. In this Syd-
ney strike the unions concerned care less
than tuppence about the public or the State.
When a public enterprise turns out to be a
privately-controlled bludgeon and citizens
working for the State commence using the
machinery of the State to throttle other citi-
zens, all the theories about the advantages
of public undertakings are reduced to hash.
When it happens that the throttling com-
mences in defence of the sacred right to pro-
tect the men employed in publicly-owned
workshops from the outrage of having the
time they spend on a job recorded, the comic
aspects of the hash claim first attention.
Yet The Bulletin is not prepared to
take seriously the objection of the men to the
introduction of time-cards at the Itandwick
and Eveleigh workshops as the real reason
for the strike. This was only an excuse for
a strike that had been several months in the
incubator. The argument against having
the time a man spends on his job recorded
will not stand looking at. Nor, obviously,
was it meant to, when the beginning, middle
and end of it was the allegation that the
result thereof would be an injustice which
could not be specified, but was suspected to
be forthcoming later on. The truth is that
Labor’s industrial machine, like its political
outfit, is at the moment in the control of
wild men who, for purposes of advancing
the Labor cause, conceived after the recent
elections the brilliant idea of hitting things
up all round on general principles. Hostility
to the other side in politics has something
to do with this. Considerations in relation
to compulsory military service enter into it.
There is a vague notion that by tying every-
thing up in a knot Capitalism will be finally
scalped and the Industrial Commonwealth
set up on its legs. Tactical considerations
at once suggested that an attack on the pub-
lic could be most effectively delivered by
hamstringing the most essential of the public
enterprises—that of transport. Wherefore
the not altogether unnatural dislike of a
section of workers, among whom it was
notorious that go-slow principles were in
full blast, to the accumulation of docu-
mentary evidence concerning physical exer-
tion, opened wide the door of opportunity
to make a start. And it is just here that
the worst phase of what may happen in con-
nection with demoralised public enterprises
becomes available for inspection. Men first
see no obligation to the State. Next they
assume they are under an obligation to regard
the State as a distributer of wages for an
indifferent return. And finally they get to
the stage when they conceive it to be their
duty as citizens to hold up the State for the
purpose of expediting chaos as an instal-
ment of a political party’s campaign. Along
that way militant Labor may see something
worth pursuit. This paper can see nothing
except the bitterest disappointment for
Labor and the collapse of State-controlled
undertakings. The opposition to these lat-
ter has always been strong. The white-ants
have been on many of them for a long time.
Labor only has to hold up to ridicule the
theory upon which they rest, and they will
go. Labor is doing that in N. S. Wales to-
day—weakening itself, discounting its oppor-
tunities and tendering additional evidence
that it has lost even its critical faculty and
is degenerating into a merely destructive in-
fluence. If Labor emerged a winner from
this strike at the railway workshops it would
do itself irredeemable moral damage. If
the State continues to fumble along conduct-
ing public enterprises without effective guar-
antees that these shall not be turned as
weapons of political offence against the
community—that they shall be neither shirk-
holes nor places for the hatching of con-
spiracies against the State itself —then it
will be aiding and abetting the industrial
anarchist.
This strike is just plain social sabotage.
The men who went on strike had not even
the excuse of possessing a tangible grievance.
They were not seeking the redress of any
wrong. Stating the case for themselves, the
only justification they could produce was an
assertion that the time-cards would lead to
grievances in the future. Asked to prove
this, they declined the invitation. Asked to
give the system a trial and produce the griev-
ances for inspection when they arrived, they
declined some more. They simply insisted
on denying the right of their own department
to institute a change of internal manage-
ment, and on asserting their own right to
either have their way or to deal out stoush
to the community. On the basis of the
strikers’ case not being bogus, all this meant
that a crowd of rebels was trying to brow-
beat the State into submission through fear.
On the basis of the strike being merely a
machine-made disturbance, it meant that
several thousand men had been prepared to
blindly follow like jumbucks wherever a
coterie of disgruntled wirepullers chose to
lead them. In either case it meant that the
public peace and convenience were made the
sport of a truculent, intolerant push. If
public ownership of utilities common to the
general citizenship cannot save the people
from assaults like this, where in the name of
commonsense are the advantages of the ex-
periment to be looked for? This paper does
not know, and has a suspicion that no one
else knows. What it does know is that this
strike makes a mockery of everything the
Labor movement and industrial unionism
has stood for in the past, and turns into jest
the whole superstructure of Labor legislation
and administration. There are perilous times
ahead of Australia. Economic problems of
a character the population has never even
dreamed about are in the making. Is there
anyone who imagines that these will be met
and dealt with by the maintenance of sucli
industrial conditions as are prevalent
day? It is very doubtful, for these condi-
tions are a sham from top to bottom, and t
Labor movement is rapidly becoming a sliam,
too. As it is to-day it stands for one th.ng
only—bashing a public which earns hostility
bv leaving itself open to attack. No state
ever stood that sort of thing indefinitely, and
Australia will not. because Australia has to
live.
NUMBER ONE.
Northcliffe. the person who first smote
fame and profit in the ribs by beating that
strenuous publication. Tit-Bits, at its own
game, has recently been putting contempo-
rary greatness into its place and marking it
with prize labels for the use of future his-
torians. According to his theory, each of the
two biggest modern wars threw up three
Number One men. The first-prize, red-label
trinity in the Napoleonic struggle consisted
of William Pitt, Wellington and Nel-
son ; the three parallel names in our own
day are those of Lloyd George, Haig and
W. M. Hughes. The comparison is an ex-
ceedingly interesting one. and should be of
immense value to the person who in after
years sits down to painfully elaborate the
story of the winning of the war. As the
history of a nation is mostly the story of the
deeds of its great men, it will be only neces-
sary to put on record the individual achieve-
ments of the three heroic and outstanding
Number One personalities, and, 10, the whole
romance of blood and fire will blossom
forth in sequence and philosophic order!
That there may be a distinct resemblance
between the parts played by Lloyd George
and Pitt seems to require little argument.
Both held the job of chief adviser to the
Crown; both made stirring speeches; both
got Ireland’s back up over the handling of
her affairs; and both worked hard to down
the chief enemy. Lloyd George may be
even greater than Pitt when the call is given
at the end of the last act and there may be a
large “A” before the “One” on his prize
ticket. The comparison of Wellington and
Haig is a little more difficult; but they have
at least this in common, that they both ad-
vanced against a powerful foe, and stood at
bay when the foe looked too powerful. Fur-
ther than this, it is impossible to go until a
parallel is found for Waterloo. But for Aus-
tralians the great and permanent joy of
Northcliffe’s comparison must lie in the
fact that W. M. Hughes is ranged beside
Nelson in the Number One class. Proudly
the victor of the Nile and Trafalgar must
watch the deeds of his successor in world-
honor and hear again in his resounding win-
the-war periods the roar of the guns of
Copenhagen or the clash of cutlasses in the
bitter fight at the Canary Islands; and amid
the confusion wrought by new-fangled sub-
marines and skittish torpedoes it must be
good for the old sea-hero to learn from the
great newspaper authority who it is that
really wears his discarded cocked-hat by
divine right in these noisy and distressing
days.
Nelson and Hughes have naturally a
great deal in common. In stature they both
appear as little men of fiery enthusiasm
battling for recognition among their taller
and more bulky fellows. Both have suffered
from the same indigestion ; and both —Nel-
son in Naples and Hughes in London —have
been the centre of groups of admiring duch-
esses. Where Nelson, with the cry of “Vic-
tory or Westminster Abbey,” led his board-
ers to the furious onset, Hughes has
equalled or eclipsed his deeds by facing a
political meeting (admission by ticket only)
in the Sydney Town Hall. Where Nelson
with matchless patience clung to the port of
Toulon for weary months to prevent the
escape of the French fleet, Hughes, with
unexampled self-denial, clung to office long
after his party had deserted him. Where
Nelson, with desperate endeavor, chased
Napoleon’s fleet across the Mediterranean,
Hughes with heroic foresight purchased a
fleet of tramp steamers. Where Nelson
with his stars and medals shining offered
himself on the deck of the Victory as a
target for the enemy’s marksmen, Hughes
faced the tongues and votes of the deadlier
P.L.L. Where Nelson refused to receive
from a spy of enemy race the information
that might have been so valuable to the fleet,
Hughes l'efused to the people of Australia
the facts relating to the war which might
have braced the continent to larger deeds in
the cause of civilisation. Where Nelson.
pale, nervous and terrified lest the chance of
battle should be snatched from him, walked
his deck in despairing silence, Hughes
poured forth torrents of words and howled
hysterically for the utter discomfiture of the
foe. Where Nelson lost an arm in battle,
Hughes lost a reputation in politics. Where
Nelson was blind of one eye, Hughes
was blind of half a conscience. Where Nelson
eagerly fought the authorities for the rights
and privileges of his sailors and gunners,
Hughes fought Joe Cook to secure Cabinet
seats for his immediate followers. The
parallelism,, which Northcliffe with his
brilliant insight into character was the first
to discover, is indeed close and remarkable.
As a Number One man, Hughes through
the astonishing likeness of his career to that
of Nelson must keep the limelight of his-
tory, and Australia must continue to share
some of his reflected glory.
Still, there is always the danger that his-
tory written too early may miscarry. Nel-
son’s own mighty reputation took a long
time to gather head ; and even now the real
man who broke the ships of Britain’s enemies
at sea is not well known except to a com-
paratively few students who have read
behind the stereotyped phrases of adulation
in which his career is usually summed-up. The
lightning brain in action, the fine courage in
imagination, the utterly gentle, deprecating
humanity of the man came very near miss-
ing their reward in national appreciation.
The average man who merely read news-
paper accounts of the war could not be ex-
pected to understand how the battle at
Aboukir Bay was won by taking the single
chance the foe had overlooked when they drew
themselves up in what they believed to be an
impregnable position. England applauded
because there was a victory; but England
did not know that there was not another
man in the navy or out of it who at one
swift glance could have seen the only pos-
sible means by which that victory could be
gained. So it is. no doubt, in the case of all
Number One men —the success is seen and
applauded, but the real genius of the wonder-
worker is missed. Hughes has met with
criticism. Last year he put to the people of
Australia by referendum the question of Con-
scription or no Conscription, and the people
turned the proposal down. That they should
do so was not altogether surprising;
what was surprising was the skill, amount-
ing to sheer genius, with which Hughes
mismanaged the campaign and irritated the
supporters of the movement. Anybody could
see the result: but what anybody could not
sop and what even the most painstaking his-
torian of the future may readily miss was
the flash of inspiration, blinding in its bril-
liancy. which enabled our Number One man
to do the wrong thing at the precise moment
at which it could be most injurious to his
own cause. How the death of Nelson will
compare at last, with the political death of
Hughes it is idle to speculate. Soutiiey
goes so far as to assert that if the hero of
Trafalgar had gone up to Heaven in a
chariot of fire he could scarcely have de-
parted in a brighter blaze of glory. A chariot
of fire seems put of the realm of possibilities
in the case of Hughes, though a taxi-cab
to take him to some mild, well-paid job
would appear likely enough. Certain it
seems, however, that as Nelson died fight-
ing, so Hughes will politically die talking.
The guns of the war cannot boom for ever;
and even when Lloyd George and Haig are
dust there will still be wagging tongues and
the hot barrage of words fencing the politi-
cal advance on the national cash-box. Let
them all talk ; let them all talk toe ther;
Hughes has still a place apart. Nc man
has counted the words he has already spoken ;
no man may predict the words he will yet
speak. The final triumph of his tongue is
wrapped about in splendid mystery, and con-
jecture fails and faints when applied to his
campaigns yet to he. But this we do know
beyond all doubt or questioning : if our Num-
ber One man w T ere set jaw to jaw with the
prime foe. if William of Wales faced
Wilhelm of Germany tongue to tongue, if
deeds were forgotten and only words could
prevail, the issue of the war would he in no
sort of doubt. Then we should be indeed
exalted : then over the wrecks of gun-fire
and bomb we should rear our trophies high
before the eyes of all men ; then we should
feel and know that in the trinity of war-
greatness our own champion held the cen-
tral and most conspicuous place.
IN A DRESSING-STATION.
[FOR THE BULLIN.]
Almost complete elimination of the beauti-
ful and aesthetic —complete save for the
splendid pure truth of it all!
It was humanity—rampant, bare. X-rayed
by circumstances; it was the raw metal,
pure, without sign of the debasing alloy of
gold-lusting, self-centred 20th century civil-
isation.
Alan, ignoring reason, temporarily revert-
ing to the blood-lust of his simian ancestors,
re-acquired in his downfall the virtue of
truth, the acting and speaking of only that
which is of him, living that which is natural.
It was not yesterday, nor last week.
Months ago it happened, but only now can
I retrospect impassionately that grim har-
vest-time of passion’s work.
A dressing-station. Name it such; but
realise it as it was then. To the walking
cases it was “Over there!” To the stretcher-
borne it was re-awakening to care and
friendship and —pain.
Padre and parson knew no creed there.
Christ was imitated, not taught. Sur-
geons, dressers, stretcher-bearers, detached
men from adjoining units forgot their re-
ligion of rank ; for dG hours they were
humanity—humanity consecrated to the task
of tending humanity desecrated.
The moaning of a tide!
Chloroform and delirious maunderings;
poignant with agony and futile heroism. A
momentary distraction from our work, as
the patient's voice rises clear above the
general murmur : “Ah-h ! Yes, yes ! Now.
boys, over we go !. . . . Where are we? No!
It’s the second line. . . .Back, it’s a feint... •
I’m coming. . . .No promenade, Marie?. • • •
Brother! Brother! Come back, you blasted
fool !. . . . He wouldn’t come back to our
trenches, sir ; he was mad, sir—his eyes were
gone. . . .Good-luck, Jack !. .. .The fool’s still
out there in No Man’s Land, sir—let me
fetch him. He’s not dead! I’ll fetch —
I’ll”
“Go ahead, Cap., lie’s under.”
Anaesthesia ended the mental torture. The
operation was finished. The bullet had won.
“Bearers!”
Not to the waiting ambulance this one.
He has given all for his nation —and a
comrade.
Bearers!
“Hello! This is a real lady-like wound.
Sure ‘Blighty,’ lad—and a real good time to
you!”
“Haemorrhage! Where? Umph! A
Boche, eh ! Come along, man, come along.
, “Nein ! .Nein !” and he doggedly kept to
his place in the queue, and pointed to the
waiting row of wounded men in front of him,
though a severed brachial artery was re-
saturating his field-dressing with blood, the
improvised tourniquet having become loos-
ened.
I touched my cap that night to Private
Fritz, as. clean, with wound dressed and
out of danger, he was ready for transport to
the Casualty Clearing-station. Unable to
speak more he gripped my arm and articu-
lated “Souvenir,” pointing to the remaining
button on his mutilated tunic. I clipped
and kept it. That German too was real
Humanity— just true man.
Ye highbrowed eugenists. stand here by
my elbow! Look ! This victim of the
cannon-god. this square-jawed man of the
wide spaces, with form and features moulded
and chiselled to vie with Apollo, can smile
our fatigue away, though in his gaping
wound nerves are visibly twitching at the
antiseptic’s touch. Breeding? Yes! But


where the difference when this one, weak-
ehinned and undersized, product of a city’s
underworld, facetiously requests the return
of the “iron ration” which has just been
extracted from his groin?
“They’re gaining on us, eh? Three more
cars just arrived !. .. . Here ! Those panniers
two deep. Stretchers —slight and medium
cases on them. Now, keep this table for
Reds [urgent cases!. Ah!”
And the surgeon with the aid of a pre-
paring orderly, an instrument hand, and a
dresser, can now diagnose and treat three
cases to his previous two.
Dawn, with occasional rain of shrapnel on
the roof. A humid, stagnant morning, heavy
and dull. The complaining “phew-w-w” of
the shells in the air was ugly harmony with
the weather conditions.
Fifteen minutes’ spell. Food —soup, bread,
bacon and tea. Five minutes’ smoke in the
open air.
It seemed strangely unfamiliar out there.
The mind and spirits sub-consciously be-
come toned and warped to environment.
A lark was reeling out its soul as it
mounted the sky. I heard its song of
triumph; and the dull boom of the great
guns supplied an ironic bass to its rhap-
sody.
The swathing wheatfields avowed Nature’s
perpetual fruitfulness; yet I saw the decay
of rust in each individual ear. Satisfaction
at the work of repair accomplished was over-
shadowed by the thought of that which was
irreparable.
And we toiled again.
Not one of those w T ho claimed our care
and skill for one whole day and a half made
needless moan or quiver. Yes, it comes to
me now —there was one. An officer, a
wounded man amongst wounded men. let go
control and cried out in his pain: “Orderly,
I am an officer!” Then his head hung for
shame, and he blundered his apologies.
There was nothing to forgive. Ilis uttered
remorse at having weakened was more heroic
than the silence of the others.
“Bearers! Bearers!” And the stream
flowed on.
“Father, you’re wanted over there.” In a
'corner of the room, a backwater of peace,
men went over their last parapet.
I heard the soft murmur of the priest’s
voice: “I absolve thee !” and I saw that the
spirit of the shattered clay on the stretcher
was content to pass to the presence of the
(jrTPflt Potter.
Later, a rebel —a rebel against most things
of life, dogmas, customs and propriety—
was there.
“Parson, give us a cigarette. Dying—be
damned ! Give us a cig.! Dying—l’ll cheat
tjie Devil. I’ll” —
The Great Potter made them both. They
were both worthy of His workmanship.
Comes the last —out in No Man’s Land for
two days. We fought for him —against
gangrene.
I think we won.

the card system is not the cause. lhe
Moulders’ Union secretary said Ins union
could distinguish between “an excuse and
“a reason” for striking. So can the public.
The moulders were called out the following
day. That was their punishment They
went obediently. That proves that a
reason” may underlie an excuse. Next
dav the P.L.L. issued a manifesto which did
not even mention the card system, but gave
the reason itself—“the men on striker are
resisting the machinations of the National
ist Government in its attempt to smash
organised Labor, thereby carrying out the pur-
pose for which it was elected.” So, then, the.
Government elected under a most demo-
cratic Constitution, with the widest demo-
cratic suffrage in the world, is the object of
this attack. Thus in Flanders Australians
are lighting for democracy, and in Australia
democratic government is being fought and
may be destroyed! The issue is plain.
Either, contrary to democratic principle and
by the exercise of superior physical force,
N. S. Wales first and Australia afterwards
will be governed by “organised Labor”
against the will of the majority of electors;
or the Government will prove that it has
no Labor-smashing policy, as it has no
Labor-smashing mandate, and then proceed
to defend Democracy here by any means that
may be needed. The Germans and the P.L.L.
have essentially the same object. They wish
for minority rule, a Prussian autocracy in
the one case and an “organised Labor”
autocracy in the other. The barrage
of high explosives, shrapnel and flaming
oil, along with good hard blows in
the face, is necessary to prove to
the Germans that democracy is best, if not
perfect. And the P.L.L. must learn the
same lesson, even if it thinks the people did
wrong in not giving it a majority at the
last elections. But a barrage of Billingsgate
is no good. The Commonwealth is not yet
directly attacked. Yet it soon may be. And
the Prime Minister has barraged the re-
serves, assembled for the wider advance, with
picturesque language of abuse that hurts no
one, exasperates many, causes unreason in
decent, level-headed citizens, and suggests
only bluff and bounce where Australia really
holds invincible physical and moral force.
The battle has begun rather weakly on the
side of democracy in Australia. Yet the
enemy is not really to be feared. His name
is “Revolutionary Syndicalism.” or Trades
Unionism with a red necktie, a hiccough in
its voice, and straws in its hair. “Indus-
trial Unionism” is a name for the same
thing in a less excited condition and with
milder manners. The “Industrialists” have
charge now of the P.L.L. Syndicalists
believe that “Direct Action” is better than
the political and parliamentary sort. They
intend to abolish popular government, as
now understood, to replace it with govern-
ment by means of a federation of unions,
each including all the workers in an indus-
try and each being fully selftgoverned. Their
method for obliterating all existing Govern-
ments is the “general strike.” This general
strike has now begun in Australia. It starts
from some vague bluff about a card system.
But it had a preliminary trial with the coal
strike last year, when the Federal Govern-
ment intervened, bluffed a bit, and, being
uncertain of its right to be a Government,
capitulated. The new attack is more seri-
ous. It assaults first a. fully authorised
State Government and has a Federal Govern-
ment of regular credentials to go on against.
If “organised Labor” wins this time, it must
constitute a Government itself; for it will
have met the full force of the Australian
Governments and defeated it with greater
force. The Australian Constitution must
then be abrogated, and a “Directory,” or
“Workmen’s Council,” or some such revolu-
tionary substitute must take its place. Do
the trades unionists of Australia really wish
to thus give up government of the people
for the people by the people and replace it
with government of the people by delegates
or other representatives of trades unions
alone? It is certain they do not. But they
are a disciplined army of “organised Labor,”
and the syndicalists are in command. If
the existing Governments will not fight for
democracy, the army in the control of the
syndicalists must win ; as the German army
would win if democratic France and Eng-
land would not fight. But if the Govern-
ments are true to their trust and fight good
and hard, no reserve unions will come up
through their barrage of real hard-hitting
stuff. Is it then to be revolution that will
surprise the rank and file of those who
unwittingly and unwillingly make it—or the
vindication of justice and freedom, under
the democratic Australian Constitution,
through the power of the people being wisely
used to the full by the Governments that
represent the poonlo?
Industrial Service.
Maoriland’s Efficiency Board recommends
the inauguration of National Industrial Ser-
vice to “maintain industries seriously threat-
ened by depletion of man-power through the
despatch of troops abroad.” If the only
alternative to industrial collapse is indus-
trial service by the population not called up
for military service, then industrial service
it should be without compunction and with-
out regard for persons or purses. But to
push men and women into the service of any
industry, essential or otherwise, conducted
for private profit would be a gross misuse of
the State’s authority. Men and women
might be called upon, and rightly, to serve
the State in an industrial capacity in the
same way as their brothers serve it in the
army. The other business would be, if not
exactly slavery, a servitude very close to it.
Wherefore the obvious duty of the M.L.
Parliament, if it touches industrial service,
is to take over the industry served and run
it in the public interest, diverting the profits
to the national cashbox for war and other
purposes. This is practical, and the only
possible step consistent with justice to the
nation and the individual citizen. It may
mean Socialism, and Sosli may mean the
Devil to Bill Massey. But what does
Massey matter, anyway? The Empire
cannot be allowed to perish because a stout
old cocky dislikes looking Truth fair in the
eye.
Why Omit to Produce a Scheme of
Operations?
Various people continue to call upon the
Federal Government to fix prices. Among
them are several who as members of the last
Labor Government were called upon to do
the same thing—and omitted t°' do_it. U
thev are not merely dealing in yells, the time
is a uite ripe to get down to the practical side
oAhe business. This paper therefore calls
upon one or other of these persons to give
Australia a lead with something more sub-
stantial than wind. The price of meat is a
sore point. Very well. Instead of being
content to wildly demand cheap meat, what
is the matter with concentrating on this par-
ticular item and producing a workable
scheme by which the public can get a pound
of steak for 6d.? To do this would be worth
a week’s frenzied howling about a mixture of
meat and cauliflowers and apples. The
Government would be shown not only what
to do but how to do it, and the way would
be Clear for argument about something else
definite and specific. Meanwhile the general
vagueness of the price-fixing party leaves
everything up in the air. No one has come
forward with anything except angry denuncia-
tion of the cost of grub and bald declara-
tions that it ought to be cheap. All this is
no more than rowdy criticism of a disordered
commercial and social system. The Bulle-
tin’s view is that the problem of production
is the crux of the business —that to fix the
price of meat or anything else is to start
half-way past the beginning and leave off
before the end. Of course, a Government
can declare that the sale of chops at more
than tuppence is an offence. That much is
easy. But the main thing is the chop itself
—the material piece of meat on the con-
sumer’s plate. Where is the advantage to
the public if chops are cheap but unprocur-
able? What assistance is it to the public to
hear a politician fiercely assailing another of
the tribe about the necessity of cheapening
nourishment, yet evading the opportunity to
show the ways and means of acquiring it?
According to the price-fixers the job is easy.
Well, it is up to them to produce the plans
and specifications, not only for inciting Red
Tape to compile an official schedule of prices,
but for getting the goods within reach of the
citizen who wants them at those prices. In-
cidentally it seems as if the yearning of the
public for cheap boots and cheap pants and
cheap furniture calls for as much considera-
tion as a reduction in the meat bill.
PORTFOLIOS AND the war.
The hatching of the so-called National Gov-
ernment of Westralia was watched with
cynical interest by those with inside infor-
mation. The National spirit, was alleged to
be the motive, but to spell it “cash ’n all
would be nearer the mark. There were four
distinct elements in the scheme to oust Pre-
mier Wilson and Labor Minister Mitchell.
Robinson, Attorney-General and Minister
for Mines, was the centre of the ferment in
the Ministry, while Lefroy was his stalking
horse. Among the Liberal rank and file there
were three or four weary of the unprofit-
able job of unpaid chorus. Their combined
brains wouldn’t produce one faint headache,
but each was convinced that unless he was m
the team Haig on the West Front would
give way to despair, and the Allies Cause
would become plain mud. All were even
more certain that Ministerial screw would
be much easier to take than the wage of the
very ordinary member of Parliament. I he
Country members saw that any coalition
could not live without them, despite then-
pledge to the outside controlling organisa-
tion that no hayseed representative would
accept Ministerial rank by coalition without
express permission. Finally the Labor frag-
ment that cut adrift from the Trades Ilall
bosses on the Conscription issue saw nothing
glorious in their isolation. The only solid
basis of the plot at the beginning was that
Wilson and Mitchell had to be shifted.
The then Premier was to be allowed a place
in the band, but instead of the conductor’s
stand he was to be put at the end where
noises are made with the side-drum, triangle,
etc. Of this Wilson wasn’t taking any, and
had his colleagues shown decent loyalty the
Casli-’n’-allists’ scheme would have fizzled
out. Robinson was a foregone conclusion,
and the highly-respectable but ponderous
Lefroy was his obedient echo. Colebatcii,
the Government leader in the Leg. Council
and a capable, popular Minister, and George,
Minister for Works, also wilted and left
Wilson in the lurch at a late moment. So
the scheme came off, and the most creditable
figure in it is Wilson. The late Premier’s
chief crime is his lack of popularity. He is
intolerant of fools, and he will not stop to
chase the goodwill of the human weevils that
creep into politics in abundance. But Wil-
SON has more ability than the majority of
his whilom followers can count between
them, and his indifference to personal popu-
larity is not the least of his qualifications in
these times when spongers on the Treasury
need to have corrosive substances dropped
on them. Few of the present Government
would tower appreciably in a baekblocks
Road Board, and when they appeal to the
country a few months hence there will be
nothing in their personnel or policy to
arouse enthusiasm. If the Treasury is
smitten vigorously it responds with the
sound of an empty tank, and instead of
making noises about assaulting the Kaiser
from Perth, the Government will be expected
to make a bomb attack on the deficit and to
spring a mine that will shift the stagnation
that is settling on the empty West. The pre-
sent Premier’s alleged popularity won’t help
much to drag the State out of the mire. The
Premier of this lowering day should rather
possess the faculty of being unpleasant to a
number of persons—starting on the patriots-
by-proxy who are staying at home enthusi-
astically and taking war-time profits with
both hands.
The Nation that Didn’t Enlist.
During the half-century which followed the
signing of the Treaty of Limerick and the
immediate tearing of that piece of paper by
Britain, 500,000 Irish soldiers are said to
have died in the service of France. Add to
this the number who enlisted in the armies
of other nations, and it can readily be seen
what a field for militarv enlistment England
closed against herself by one crooked politi-
cal act. Wherever there is a fight on there
is generally an Irishman close handy : and
the* services that Leinsters and Inniskillens
have rendered in British wars need no sort
of press-agenting. But history strangely re-
peats itself where British incapacity for gov-
erning Ireland is concerned. The Broken
Treaty of Limerick left England not'only
without the troops she could so easily have
had, but with those troops actually ranged
against her; and sometimes —as in the case
of Fontenoy—snatching a hard-won victory
away at tlie last moment. In the present
war the broken Home Rule pledge appears
to have had a somewhat similar effect. Oi
all countries of this alleged Empire Ireland
has contributed proportionally the smallest
number to the Allied cause. Her contribu-
tion to tlie army and navy since the trouble
started is only 94,823 men out of a popula-
tion of over 4,000,000. Maoriland out of a
population of 1,000,000 has sent- almost as
many. The explanation is not difficult. That
England hadn’t kept her word, and Ireland
wasn’t going to fight for her until she did,
accounts for a lot of the refusal to put on
khaki; but some more is due to recruiting
methods. When the Kaiser went blood-mad
Irish leaders hegged that the recruiting
should be left to Irishmen who knew the
people, and could make the appeal to them
that they understood; but English officials,
as usual, knew better. They sent over shoals
of persons of Cockney speech to attempt to
bully and coax Pat and Denis into the
ranks; and Pat and Denis, quicker of wit
and not in the least moved by the sort of
appeal made, gave the foreign agents a bad
time. Recruits didn’t come forward; re-
cruiters grew angry and threatened their
audiences; and the threats stimulated the
Sinn Fein movement into life. Apparently
even Ulster didn’t respond to any extent to
the appeal of ’Arris to go out arid get nobly
slain ; and now. with the war at its blackest,
England is again left as in the eighteenth
century without the half-million eager, dare-
devil soldiers who might count for so much
along the Flanders Front. It is a thing to
be lamented; and in the court of history
England will have to plead guilty to another
succession of dull blunders.
Heaven only knows what the war in general
and the submarine in particular are going
to do for us this year; but last year they
upended the national trade statistics to our
great advantage. The Commonwealth ex-
ports for the statistical 12 months to June
30 were £10,556.871 in excess of the imports,
almost reversing the calamitous figures of the
previous year, when the imports were
£12,544,044 more than the exports. During
the four years 1912-T5 we acquired mer-
chandise to the value of £31,694,860 in ex-
cess of our exports. The later figures there-
fore reduce the trading debt to £20,000.000.
Here are the details: —
Imports. Exports.
1912- .. £76,483.360 £66,634,490
1913- .. 78,196,109 74,773,034
1914- . . 63,563,781 57,684,910
1915- .. 76,737,589 64,020,233
1916- .. 75,463,568 86,020,439
Rut unfortunately the last line of figures
don’t really mean what they seem to. It is
not because we have embarked on new rules
of life, but only because manufacturers at
the other end have been unable to fill the
orders we have sent them, that the
year’s figures relating to imports are not
away up over the skyline. Never
before in the history of Australia did
we spend so much with the foreigner
on apparel. It was our “banner” year for
the ornate waistcoat and the decorative
blouse —£20,559,510! What the figures would
have been had the submarine not spoken, it
almost makes one faint to think about. So
we refuse to get any comfort to speak of out
of the figures. If they are what they are
because we had seen that it was necessary to
pay our way—well and good. Rut that
would mean importing no more than we could
pay for with exports after the latter had
discharged our annual interest debt; and
there is not the least indication that we have
yet seriously awakened to the necessity for
that.
“Three Star” : I note that firms are still
“making up” salaries of men who left over
two years ago and are still above ground.
Certainly a most patriotic idea, and onb that
must go a long way to help recruiting. Rut
it doesn’t help the A.I.F. to get the best men
into responsible positions. A man who. has
been earning £5 ss. a week joins as a private
at 6s. a day, and his boss makes up the extra
9s. a day. As a private he has next to
no responsibility, and 15s. a day in all. As
a sergeant bis load of worry is considerably
heavier, and he still gets 15s. a day-—los.
from the Government and ss. from his boss.
It doesn’t matter to him where Jthe cash
comes from so long as he gets his 15s. a day.
The result is that a number of men in this
position don’t try for promotion ; and many
a good man is lost that way. W hy don t some
of the bosses who have been paying out pati-
ently for nearly three years drop Rilljim
a note reminding him that he is still a pri-
vate, whereas he should be something better.
And’a postscript to the effect that promotion
at his new job will be liable to count when
promotion in his old job is being considered
by-and-bye. He might wake up then and do
a fair thing for both the generous boss and
the A.I.F.
“Eloc” : The Higgins pastoral award may
look stiff, but there is no industry in the
Commonwealth better able to stand high
wages. The station-owners are allegedly
greatly concerned about employing less men
and thereby creating hardship; but in all
my wanderings over Australia I nevei
struck a station that employed a man too
many. There is indeed payable room for
far more hands in order to reduce the great
yearly losses in stock. At present there is
too much loafing about tlie homestead view-
ing the rural scenery. The squatter may also
in future try to lessen the fly pest, which if
fought properly would mean the saving of
hundreds of thousands of sheep yearly.
Some even now are tackling it by either
poisoning the carcase or burning it. and
where this is done the losses from flies are
few. Within a mile from where I am sitting
I could gather 1000 carcases (grown), and
if I included newly-born lambs I could count
3000. A few years ago I was out Nyngan

of'grass grow where only one has grown
before has been long regarded as a public
benefactor. Equally worthy of public credit,
because equally a national benefactor, is the
man—Judge or otherwise —who makes two
sheep grow where one grew before.
They are in the fourth lap now —and the
end looks as remote and doubtful as it did
at any time. Germany’s grip upon Western
Europe may be threatened. But the ines-
capable facts are that the German is there,
that he has been practically relieved of seri-
ous danger on the Eastern front, and that
he is arguing the point with llaig and
Detain with great emphasis. In the most
recent battle the Allies are reported to have
attained their objectives. This may mean
quite a lot. And it may mean no more than
similar explanations have meant on at least
175 previous occasions. Whether the objec-
tives were worth securing, or whether, hav-
ing been secured, anything of a decisive
character is going to happen in conse-
quence, are matters upon which the
censorship keeps the enemy in ignorance,
in case that ill-informed person has not
sized up the situation for himself. The
superficial story of the latest battle up to
last week was that, after a stupendous bom-
bardment. there was a sudden advance by the
attacking troops over a front of 18 miles,
easy progress across the churned-up earth
swept by preliminary shellfire, and then —-
very powerful resistance and a sudden stop.
On one side there is the claim that an
advance limited to the area pulverised by
artillery is in conformity with a new system
of Allied tactics —that of blasting a way
through step by step. On the other hand
the German’s yarn is that he, too, is adopting
new tactics by working an “elastic front” —
that the aim of the attack was to thrust up
into his position covering the submarine
bases, and that by hitting back quick and
hard when the assault developed he inter-
rupted the game effectively. The probability
>s that both stories have an element of truth
in them—that where artillery can be concen-
trated on certain positions an advance of
sorts can be made, but that otherwise the idea
of “breaking through” and “rolling up” and
all the rest of it is impracticable where the
lines are deeply held and reserves are avail-
able.
In this ‘.‘home” letter you get at what is at
the back of young Billjim’s mind :
We are absolutely fed up of Australian politics.
Scheming spouters spend a hundred thousand quids
on an election and things are just as bad after it as
they were before. This time we had the blessed
thing sprung on ,us: no one knew anything about it
and hadn’t a point explained. Most of us thought
it was the usual old Liberal and Labor business;
and when they saw Laborites and Liberals in the
one party, thousands just tossed it in and didn’t vote
at all. If they must burden the country witli ex-
penses, why don’t they let us know what it is all
about? There was a paper, All for Australia,
which took the Ministerial side; but even now, after
the vote has been taken, we in France don’t know
the other party’s platform or views or arguments or
anything. All you hear is a snort of disgust, along
with this question that we can’t get anyone to
answer: “If a chap of 19 is good enough to fight for
his country, why isn’t he good enough to vote for
it?” That sticks in the gizzard of tens of thousands
of fellows, and you’ll hear them talking of settling in
England—there are hundreds that want to. And
plenty of them are not these youngsters either.
“O. Blin”: The Age strafed Hughes the
other day, whereupon the little mgn called
the Confusion together and wrenched from
it a certificate of character which he
flourished at his critics. Heaven oply knows
what transpired at the meeting, but it must
have been vastly different from the stark
rebellion that is being muttered in the
lobbies. Any pressman about the House can
easily fasten a disgruntled Nationalist to
each ear and get an opinion of Hughes
beside which what the Hun says about
Woodrow Wilson is an illuminated address.
Yet the pretence of Fusion solidarity is still
kept up by hard lying and a grotesque simu-
lation of brotherly love. And not all the
drumfire of the Syme organ can remove the
Midget if he decides to stick it out. His
position is made almost invulnerable by the
fact that Forrest, Cook, Watt and Irvine
are unable to agree upon his successor.
Briefly, Hughes realises, like everybody else,
that their disunion is his strength. This is
a Fusion of patriots to win the war!
Prime-Minister Hughes, about the British
Government’s wool purchase :
It was evident that the Australian wool industry,
as at present conducted, was far from being ■well
organised, particularly as regarded fellmongering,
scouring, carbonising, and wool tops and woollen
manufacture. If the maximum value of the wool
was to be obtained by growers, it was necessary that
attention should be paid to those subsidiary indus-
tries.
Whereupon the S. M. Herald :
Exactly what that means is somewhat obscure,
because practically all the wool sold prior to the
acquisition was in the open market, with local con-
sumers having all the advantage on their side. They
were able to secure wool at first hand, and put it
through The mills before the buyers for the oiev-
ocean factories could ship it.
What guff it all is! The subsidiary wool
industries aren’t “well-organised” in the
Commonwealth now chiefly because certain
fiscal-sinkers and Foreign-traders insisted
upon having them organised somewhere else.
Hughes and the Herald know who those
people were; and they don’t mend matters
by being humbugs in the present as well as
in the past.
Alfred Allen, the Quaker poet, who repre-
sented Waver ley in the 13th, 14th and 15th
N. Parliaments (1887-94) and was old
Henry Parkes’s whip, died this week.
During the three years of war the P. and
O. Co. has lost seven of its Australian liners
--Maloja, Medina. Persia. Ballarat. Arabia,
Mongolia and Mooltan. The only old
“M’s” left are the Malwa and the Morea.
Germany is no doubt aiming at Petrograd.
for once there it believes it can make a
separate peace with Russia. But Germany s
trouble will be to find the right thing to
make the peace with. There are two parties
in Russia- —one that will fight and the other
that won’t. With the latter the Hun can
make peace all right; it is much more doubt-
ful whether he will be able to do it with the
other. And peace with this other is the only
peace that matters to Germany.
“Serve you right!” says George Reid to
the Labor party in a Pall Mall column on
the late elections. “If you had accepted my
offer to continue as High Commissioner with-
out salary until the end of the war, Andy
Fisher would have remained Premier and
Billy Hughes would not have got the chance
of smashing you into smithereens.” Not quite
in those words, of course; but that is un-
mistakably his meaning.
The offer of three seats in Peake’s Liberal
Government in S. Aus. is apparently to be
accepted by Vaughan’s “National” lot, just
out of office; but at the moment there is
a doubt whether Vaughan himself may
not be dropped—the Lord and party politi-
cians only know why. On the other hand.
Peake, whose position at the top was lately
tottery, looks all right again. Angas Par-
sons, K.C., who is not even in Parliament,
has issued a circular expressing his views.
His time will come, doubtless; but mean-
while the fact that he is a son-in-law of
Advertiser Bonython has set some anony-
mous writers arguing that there has been
enough of family influence in S.A. politics.
The one thing certain seems to be that some
Liberals will break away from their party
if it completes a coalition with any brand
whatever of Labor; and some others will
break away from it if it doesn’t. Why the
Sensible State doesn’t try the experiment of
an Elective Ministry, with the Referendum
behind it, the disgusted public doesn’t
know. But the party politician does.
S. Aus. Works Minister, being deputa-
tionised for some relief in getting the flood-
waters of the Torrens away into the sea, has
proposed cutting a mouth through the sand-
hills that block it at Henley Beach. No
doubt it could be done all right, and possibly
for a mere £35,000; but when you start play-
ing with tidal waters the first cost is likely
to be only a trifle. Glenelg. three or four
miles to the south, tried, 40 years ago, to
handle some of this same Torrens water,
coming down the Patawalonga. Everything
was as scheduled —until the sea took a hand.
Then nothing was left but raudbanks —and
the bonds which were to pay for the scheme.
They came to maturity all right, and hung

“Harrison O.”: The Melbourne Art Gal-
lery’s Board of Trustees (which is one of
the standing jokes of the village) was
thrown into a state of agitation the other
day by an offer from the Adelaide Art Gal-
lery of a loan of Orpen’s “Sowing New
Seed.” The only professional artist on the
Board strongly recommended that the pic-
ture should be obtained, but a couple of doc-
tors of divinity promptly objected, one of
them denouncing it as “a beastly thing.”
The result was that the matter was hung up
and Melbourne’s chance of seeing Orpen’s
work seems remote. By a committee on
which artists were anything like adequately
represented the remarks of persons wholly
ignorant of art would be received with polite
derision, but in addressing a Board of 18
members comprising a doctor of medicine, a
couple of theologians, a retired banker, an
ex-Gaud Mayor and others too humorous to
mention, the prattler who has the courage
of his ignorance can rest assured that his
lack of knowledge will be treated with re-
spect. Many members of the Board look at
pictures simply from the standpoint of the
man who “understands what he likes” —
meaning, of course, that he likes what he
understands. Among such a crew the pro-
fessional artist merely represents a voice
heard off stage. If we are to have doctors of
divinity usurping the functions of art critics,
why not appoint Norman Lindsay and Souter
to examine students seeking entry to a theo-
lojgical college?

Nobody can say for certain whether “The
Red Widow” at Melbourne Majesty s is a
half-baked comic opera or a melodrama
which took the wrong turning and got
married to a burlesque. Musically con-
sidered it is poor stuff for an opera, and
in its mock melodrama moments it is not
much better. Flo Young is a lurid Nihilist
sworn to kill that now extinct potentate,
the Czar of Russia, whilst Roberts is a
wooden officer who salutes his own solemn
loyalty and cries “Long live the Czar!
Also when Florence prepares to shoot the
reigning nuisance with a pocket-pistol,
Roberts looks reprovingly at her —and con-
verts her to loyalty on the spot! Mean-
while Phil Smith has been rushed into the
position of a harmless Yankee manufacturer
of corsets who receives bombs for the pur-
pose of destroying the Czar, but drops them
into an ice bucket and pours champagne on
them. There are three acts and consider-

•‘Daddy Long Legs” promises to have
attractions for the young and artless at
Melbourne Royal, especially at matinee
shows. After the first act it is an uninter-
rupted feast of virtue and flow of purest
sentimentality. The misunderstandings that
arise between the seraphic Waldron and the
angelic Kathlene Macdonell are possible
only to penny novelette creations, and the
extreme goodness of Emma Temple, the
fairy matchmaker of the narrative, falls like
drops of ointment on the soul of the present
scribe and Pharisee. To his way of thinking
Sallie and Jimmie and the inkspot on the
carpet that causes consternation at the
young ladies’ tea party are the most con-
vincing features of the mild proceedings at
the Royal; but the chair with the broken
leg also has distinct claims to realism.
A new drama of overpowering war inter-
est is impending at Melbourne Princess’s.
The title is “Seven Days’ Leave.’’ and the
preparations are regardless of expense. In
this case Allan Wilkie will be a captain
of artillery, whilst the leading lady imper-
sonates the girl who sank a (Herman sub-
marine. Saturday is the night appointed
for the discomfiture of the pirate craft and
crew, and meantime the story of the Rosary
is not played out.
From this paper’s old-established Mel-
bourne critic :
A series of Beethoven Quartette performances by
Verbrugghen and three colleagues was started at the
Melba Hall a week or two ago, but the usual enthu-
siastic notices in the dailies were powerless to attract
what is known as the “music-loving public.” Then,
after three concerts, the glowing notices were sup-
ported by letters of lamentation, and from shame the
hall was pretty well filled.
I went to the fourth concert in search of causes
for all the talk and fervid exhortation. I found no
reason why students of the University Conservatorium
shouldn’t have been com-
pelled to go there for the
good of their education, or
why the dilettanti who
always talk ecstatically of
all the latest doings in cul-
ture shouldn’t have seized
this opportunity to hobnob
together and keep their cul-
ture warm, so to speak.
Dilettantism has its duties
as well as its poses to at-
tend to, and you can’t be
a “patron.” in this young
and poorly musicked country
without putting yourself out
of the way to patronise those
expositions of Art which can
never appeal to the philistine
majority.
On the other hand, I saw
every reason why all the non-
assertive lovers of music who
do not themselves play on
stringed instruments should
not have been there —unless
they happened to be living
nearby. The Beethoven quar-
tettes were scholastic —always

tions. What other appeal was there? To take the
average suburbanite to that Melba Hall concert cost
more than a journey to, say, the Auditorium when
the Cherniavskis are making high-class instrumental
music. The out-of-the-way entertainment itself was
comparatively dear. And finally the Melba Hall is
a painfully cold place, with staring white walls and
no balcony. It is an attachment to the Uni. estab-
lishment, and a suggestion of snobbish pedantry can
be detected in its being. The noisy complaints of
meagre attendances at the first of these recent con-
certs were more than anything else admissions of the
hall being misplaced, or the management being at
fault, or both.
Incidentally I’d like to know whether any of the
Lady Northcote Fund is sunk in this uninviting
home. Long years ago Lady Northcote started a
fund which was to provide, in due course, for the
maintenance of a permanent orchestra for the benefit
of the public at large. What is going to result from
the two or three thousand pounds subscribed long
ago ? Are moderately musical people ever going to
get any entertainment, or the Musicians’ Union any
means of living, from it?
“Out There” at Melbourne King’s con-
tinues to be off the beat of the average
playgoer. Apparently much of Melbourne
and its wife doesn’t w T ant to be reminded
that there is a war on, especially when the
reminder is seasoned with home-truths and
•studded with urgent calls for service. Still,
with all its good intentions, the piece cannot
lie regarded as an enjoyable entertainment.
Primarily it never forgets that it is a tract
and never provides enough enlivenment to
compensate citizens for sitting it out. Even
the Collins-street Baptist Church knows
better than that. It always helps down the
Rev. Teruth’s sermons with the hearty music
of a choir.
At Melbourne Auditorium two farewell
Scotney-White concerts will carry the series
on till Saturday, and then the well-beloved
pair of vocalists must really go away for a
time. Next week Balboni from the Italian
Opera Co. comes along, together with the
Kennedy trio of instrumentalists; and a
week later the Cherniavskys will return,
strikes and other infirmities permitting.

nine on a faltering heart in a Triangle war-

“Grumpy,” running an enormously suc-
cessful course at Adelaide Royal, is just an
ordinary four-act diamond-robbery drama
which has happened to take the fancy of an
actor-manager very skilful in character-
studies. So he has carefully built up a sort of
extravagant Dickens “character” out of his
old-man part, and the rest of the play has
to revolve round it and wait while he makes
strange noises over his food and in his
sleep. It is fine art —of its kind; and the
public enjoys every moment of it. The male
support is good-—one feels sorry when they

asian Films, who has just returned after
glancing over the Film World of America.
have to do pantomime tricks so that Grumpy
can score off them—and. on the other side,
Dorothy Gumming and Betty Murray are
actresses of quite unusual charm and skill
combined. At the Tivoli “The Girl who
Knew a Bit” is a melodrama that seems to
try just how much the patron will stand.
For example, the mui-derous maniac and the
maiden: “Aha, that locket! My reason re-
tui-ns. I am your mother. You are my
child!” Lorna Forbes is the maiden who
strays with steps unwary through snares
unseen, and Phyllis Hardinge scores heavily
as the Knowing One. The Fisk Jubilee
ci-owd at the Queen’s Hall have some fine
voices—Marshall Palmer’s baritone, Lyla
Wyburd’s soprano, Bella Gibbons’s deep
masculine notes, and Bertha Miller’s vari-
ous -’.nd popular tones.
From “Centurion” (he’s an qfficer and
“Ilio” is another, and neither is an inexperi-
enced youngster) :—
“Rio” i says (B. 2/8/’17) that “one officer does
not salute another officer off duty,” only doing so
“when addressing or being addressed by a senior
officer on parade or duty (v. Com. Mil. Regs.).”
King's Regs. (par. 1986) lays down that all officers,
when in uniform, must salute their seniors, as the
rank and file must do. I would like to see what would
happen to “Rio” if he failed to salute many a
senior officer of my acquaintance when passing him
on the street or about a camp; or if he kept his
seat in the ante-room when the “Old Man” or the
senior major came along. The custom was always
rigidly adhered to by Australian officers in peace
times, if only for the sake of setting an example
in the foolery they were compelled to teach their
subordinates.
It was the new blood in the Vic. Assem-
bly that nearly pushed Premier Peacock off
his perch lately. Of the 18 Liberals who
supported him only four were of a later vin-
tage than 1910; of the 22 assorted Libs, who
voted to put him among the has-beens, exactly
half have entered public life during the past
seven years. Outside the Economy party of
18 members the four Ministerialists who
voted against the Government were all new
men—Baird (Ballarat West), Gordon
(Waranga), Menzies (Lowan) and Mitchell
(Goulburn Valley). However, Labor de-
cided not to give the new men a chance, and
voted 10 to 5 against Bowser. So Peacock
holds his job in face of the fact that a
majority of his own brethren voted against
him.
Professor Laby. secretary of the Imperial
Federation League, lectured at the Mel-
bourne Socialist Hall the other evening in
defence of the League’s principles. One.thing
the Socialist party can do is to provide an
audience; but when it comes to enthusiasm,
either for or against any view, the concern is
as expressive as a Monday full of wet
blankets. The proceedings open and close
with song, and there is usually a general
discussion after the chief speaker has made
his offering. But never is there a quip or
a quirk or a flash of fun. The one outstand-
ing characteristic of the audience is its utter,
unanimous sadness. University professors
have lectured and argued at the Socialist
Hall before Laby, and there will be others
latex-, no doubt. But nobody of that calibre
does it twice, any more than the canny he-
goat butts a brick wall more than once.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“0.K.”: As for the old idolatry of the
Howard Vernon creations —well, I never
was an idolator. A tall, forceful actor can,
of course, make a great popular success with
a highly-colored misrepresentation of a humor-
ous character. Vernon's picture of Bun-
thorne in “Patience’’ was a great success
with audiences that knew nothing of the cult
of aestheticism in its birthlaud, and had never
seen George Grossmitli. for whom the part
was written. Bunthorne was a satire on the
slim, mock-spiritual apostles of the cult.
Howard Vernon, with his huge form, hoarse
voice and over-accentuation of poses and
rhapsodies, caricatured the satire. The same
with his ultra-gruesome Wilfred, the Assist-
ant Torturer, in “Yeoman of the Guard.”
It gave no suggestion of the dull egotist who
aspires to be recognised as a wit and humor-
ist. Vernon’s Wilfred was always calliug
attention to his absurdity. He stressed his
points. He impressed his audience in the
same way as a singer, with a good, rough
voice, who “chucks it at ’em.” His sort of
forcefulness is most effective with intelligent
theatre-goers as long as they remain young
and have not seen the same thing done in a
more delicately-artistic way. In after years
they quote it as having been great, and they
still stick to their old illusion when a new
performer practically intites them to drop
and shatter it. The only old recollections of
Gilbert and Sullivan opera performances
that I will swear by tljus far are Robert
Brough as Lord Chancellor in “lolanthe,”
Courtice Pounds as Fairfax in “Yeoman of
the Guard,” Aggie Thorne as Phoebe in the
same opera, and J. C. Williamson as the
Judge in “Trial by Jury.”
“Jwosp” : Carreno, just dead from paraly-
sis in the U.S.A.. was a much-married
woman. She said “Yes” on four occasions.
Two of her husbands were brothers, and all
were more or less musicians. The original was
Sauret, violinist; she married him in 1878,
when he was making his first brilliant tour
of the States. The next was Giovanni Taglia-
pietra, a baritone, who lasted eight or nine
years. Then she lined up with Eugin
D’Albert (1892-5). He was a brilliant pian-
ist, the son of a Hun dancing-master living
in Scotland. The last trier was Arturo
Tagliapietra. whom the lady married in 1902.
He saw her out. Carreno’s offspring are well
scattered among the belligerents. Eldest
daughter Emilie Sauret is wife of a Hun offi-
cer, a prisoner in France. Teresita Taglia-
pietra. from the second marriage, is giving
concerts in London, and inherits some of
mother’s powers. Her husband is an Eng-
lishman. Incidentally, she was grabbed by
the French as a spy in Algiers in the early
days of the war. but explanations were satis-
factory. Giovanni, jun., is a baritone,
like dad, and is interned in Ilunmany, where
he is regarded as an American. Two
daughters of D’Albert are wedded to Huns.
“Cosmetique” : After all, there is nothing
remarkable in the picture successes of Enid
Bennett and Sylvia Bremer. Their faces
were their fortunes from the beginning.
When Sylvia was a kid in pinafores and
used to hang her big brown eyes over the
Manly pierrot fences, the pierrettes used to
sigh enviously. “ Isn’t she lovely?” Before
long, when you unwrapped someone’s soap
or hair tonic, you saw Sylvia’s di-ooping
chin and long curls. Enid got her chance
to act in Hilda Spong’s production of
“Everywoman,” because she resembled th(\
girl who played Modesty abroad. Before
that her beauty had helped her to squeeze her
pretty shoulders through the J. C. William-
son doors and walk on with Dorothy
Gumming. Maude Plunkett and other Aus-
tralians in H. B. Irving’s productions.
11.8. appeared in Australia in pictures sim-
ultaneously with Enid Bennett; but in that
business Enid easily lost the speaking star.
“Deadhead” : Cabled that Sara Bernhardt
is contemplating a tour through America
and Australia to restore her shattered
finances. No one who has seen her act dur-
ing the last few years can receive the news
with any enthusiasm. Sara owes it to her
reputation to retire gracefully while there
are still a few people who can remember her
in her prime. At present she is chiefly in-
teresting as an example of what complexion
foods can do for grandmothers. And. un-
fortunately. youth only remains in her face.
When it comes to moving about the stage she
must have the aid of adjacent furniture —and
she moves as little as possible. Her recent
ventures at the London Coliseum have been
mainly one-act dramas that allowed her to
sit still while a complicated net of intrigue
was woven round her. Then she could rise
like a soaped geyser and tear the whole
flimsy structure to pieces in an orgy of pure
destructiveness, sinking back into coma at
the fall of the curtain. A spirited perform-
ance for an old lady, but no one of humane
feeling could get much pleasure from the
exhibition.
Another actor has hopped over the Lot-
lights into khaki—Reg Rivers, 24. of Fitz-
rov (Vie.). Born in California, lie reached
here seven years ago with Harry Brescoe s
Musical Revue Co., and thereafter played
many parts. He is the first Amurkan citizen
to enlist at Melbourne Town Hall since the
Gridiron joined the Jack in the trenches.
Two of his brothers, Fred and George, ot
the sth Light Horse, were killed in Lal-
lipoli.
“Fax’’: Surely “Mallet” (B. 2/8/T7) i*
confusing Henry Irving with some otliei
actor who had a reputation for niggardliness.
The Lyceum under his management had a
more generous salary list than had ever been
dreamed of in any theatre previous to his
regime. Irving was the first to pay a living
wage to supers and the small fry of the
profesh. His kindness to broken-down mum-
mers whom he had known in his struggling
days was proverbial. He practised this
virtue, too. in the most courteous manner.
As for the cab story that “Mallet” speaks
of, it’s preposterous, on the face of it. in
its alleged application to Henry Irving.
Based on the idea that “he always carefully
endeavored to conceal his identity from
cabby,” it supposes that such concealment
was possible, whereas Irving, with his
picturesque and profusely-photographed face
and long hair, was as well known as the
town clock.
"A.S.”: The rumor that Hughes may
restrict the importation of films may mean
a lot for the local producer if the picture
magnates do not meet the emergency by
storing film. If they do this, which is more
than likely, Australia will still be surfeited
with Yankee flim-flam, and the whole trade
may be cornered by a few men whose fore-
sight was better than Hughes’s. A per-
manent restriction on incoming films,
especially American films, would, on the
other hand, mean the making of an industry
in Australia. This country has the material:
it has the market; and it is daily reminded
that many of its least good actors and
actresses have joined the star stock of
America. There is no reason, then, why New
York and Chicago should not buy Austra-
lian-grown films. The tonic effect on
Wilson’s people of a little Billjim humor and
some Outback pleasantries would be well
worth while.
“Floater”: “L.H.P.’s” statement (B.
26/7/T7) that “Sheridan’s ‘Critic’ has not
been seen for years in Australia” is not
quite correct. Gregan McMahon did portion
of the comedy—the rehearsal of Mr. Puff’s
tragedy at Drury Lane—-at the first season
of the Melbourne Rep. Theatre in June, 1911.
The script employed by McMahon formerly
belonged to Hoskins, who figured as Puff in
his performances of the piece in Aus-
tralia. McMahon, by the way, made one
of his earliest successes in “The Critic,”
staged by the Sydney Uni. Dramatic Society.
He doubled the parts of Sir Fretful Plagiary
and Don Whiskerandos.
“Mack”: “Norbell’s” statement (B.
26/7/T7) re playing in two dramas a week
for four months at Rockhampton (Q.) is
correct. How do I know? I was there, and
had been on the job about four months be-
fore “Norbell” arrived. He did the juveniles
and I was the bold, bad bloque. During my
whizzing season, I played (mostly heavies)
in 58 dramas and never missed one night.
(Cheers.) I am now the proprietor of a
beer emporium near a railway-construction
camp, and, believe me, handling a bunch of
wild navvies is kid’s play compared with
that Rockhampton season.
“Fax” : “The Red Widow,” as the title for
an opera, reminds one of the song which
Lizzie Collins, sister of Lottie, popularised
at Rickards’s years ago. She was a demure
little widow in the beginning of every verse.
Her outer garment was the deepest mourn-
ing. Then she raised her skirt to dance, and
all the underwear was the color of burning
coal. Lizzie Collins was the original Red
Widow, I fancy.
“Flick Click” : Oh, these Yankee picture
producers! In a recent version of “The Tale
of Two Cities” not only was Miss Pross
robbed of her sense of humor, but Lucie
didn’t have her baby. Seeing it was more
for the baby and its mamma than daddy
Darnay that Carton gave his life at the guil-
lotine, the American picture-packers can
scarcely be excused. They will give us a
million-dollar Ghostless “Hamlet” presently
if we don’t look out.
“Peg-Leg”: “Harrison O.” (B. 2/8/T7)
shouldn’t blame the performer for the encore
nuisance in vaudeville houses. The manager
is the culprit. Every turn that goes on is
expected to provide at least one encore
whether the audience wants it or not. Some-
times two recalls are demanded—from
behind. I have painful recollections of
being sacked because I couldn t squeeze three
encores out of a morgue-like house. My con-
tract said I must give two songs at two
houses a night; and when the second show
shut down the audience of the first was
expected to endure me during four idiotic
“rags.”

SHE HAD IT.

"Boyd Cable” (In the air, over the Eng-
lish Channel) : At this present moment of
writing I am 12,500 feet above the Channel,
and it just struck me that a par. taking a
high view of the scrap would adorn The
Bulletin. It isn't very difficult to write, so
far as steadiness goes, but it’s a trouble to
keep the notebook anchored down. When I
opened the pages, although I held it well
down in the shelter of the cockpit, I thought
the forced draught was going to rip the
whole inside out before I could grab the
fluttering leaves. Between sentences I pause
to cock an anxious eye round the horizon, it
being only a few days since the raid on
Folkestone at about this afternoon hour.
We carry bow and stern guns, but we’re
merely ferrying over, and not anxious to
bump' into a' fleet and a 16 to 1 scrap. We’re
travelling at just on 85 miles per hour.
There’s no hope of conversation with the
pilot, because the row of the engine and the
roar of the wind make the most frantic
shouts fade out and vanish a mile astern
before they quit one’s lips. At the present
rate of travel we’ll complete the trip from
the English coast to well inland in France in
under an hour —a bit of an improvement on
the usual all-day or two-day job of return-
ing from leave by train, boat and train. And
there’s no risk of being U-boated. All the
same, I’ve got a lifebelt as big as a feather
bolster strapped on my back and chest.
That’s in case of the engine committing any
foolishness. I’ve no hankering for an aeroplane
as a bathing-machine, so devoutly hope the
lifebelt doesn’t get a show. (Somewhere in
France, later.) Did the journey in exactly
50 minutes from ground to ground. Smooth
crossing until the latter part of the journey,
when “bumps” became frequent and free.
Bumps are unpleasant. I’ll tell about them
another time.
“Corporal”: We don’t like being rooked,
and we look to our own Minister for Defence
to protect us. Before going on leave from
the Desert to Alexandria I wired friends
advising them that I was coming. The
message was purely personal. It wasu t
delivered. I found that it hadn’t been sent,
and naturally asked for my money back.
This is the reply I got (original enclosed) :
Egyptian State Telegraphs.
Cairo, May 10, 191".
Hoar Sir. —With reference to your letter of 7th
inst. addressed to Inspector Telegraphs, Ismailia, your
telegram was' stopped by order of the Deputy Chief
Military Censor, G.H.Q.
Under the circumstances / regret that no refund
can be made.
The camp calls this plain, blank dishonesty.
Is there no redress? If there isn’t, there is
a grievance; and unredressed grievances
don’t do any good to an army recruited and
reinforced by voluntary enlistment.
“Futsae”: Recent regulations prohibiting
entertainments in aid of any one soldier have
made liars and lawbreakers of kindly old
maids and parsons out our way. Despite
the official veto, some Bible-class scholars
went ahead and organised a concert for a
popular and deserving Billjim, and the police
got wind of it. The chief organiser—a
highly respectable dame —risked many years
gaol by solemnly swearing that the object
was to raise funds for the Bible class and
not for the soldier. The Law then tackled
the parson, who opined that the cash was
wanted to construct a new tennis-court. And,
after all, poor old Billjim gave the show
away by going on a glorious spree the night
after the performance, finishing up by tell-
ing the police what he thought of men in
uniform who tried to stop a cove from getting
a little overtime. Now the Law is feverishly
searching for the account-books of the enter-
tainment. and the congregation trembles and
sings the hymns in quavering voices.
“It.D.F.” : It takes more than artillery to
shake old Billjim’s nerves. A salient about
200 yards on our left very frequently came
in for a deluge of fire. One particular y
heavy bombardment awoke Billjim from 11s
slumbers. lie came out of his
flimsy dugout blinking and for
a few seconds watched tin 1
salient being removed by instal-
ments. ‘‘l see the is dust-
in’ our parapet again." he said
and went back again to his
slumber.
THE MODERN _ HANDMAIDEN.
"How much smarter Mrs. Boller is dressing
of late!”
“Oh, yes. Didn't you know? She's got a
new maid —a perfect treasure of a girl
who gives her all her left-off gowns.”
“Trooper Bluegum” : Digging in amidst a
shower of bullets and shrapnel opposite Gaza
one Anzac cavalier exclaimed : “My Gord, I
wish I was an ant!’’ Another , scratching
with his bayonet and scooping out with his
hands at a tiny funk hole, cried plaintively :
“Oh. why did I cut my nails this morning!”
A third, as he gazed ruefully at a gaping
wound in his shoulder, soliloquised : “Gripes,
it must ha’ been an axe that stopped me, not
a bullet.” Another toppling over with a
bullet in his knee, remarked judicially and
without a trace of animosity : “One to you.
Abdul.” Many and varied are the exclama-
tions of Billjim in the heat of battle; but on
the eight-hours' train-journey back to
Ivantnra the crowds of wounded cried unani-
mously for “Water, water, water!”

“Brighton” : Fight on for a little more bed
for the poor kids in Melbourne Orphan Asy-
lum (B. 12/7/T7) ! The bell still clangs at
0 a.m., the bitter cold continues and the
children still suffer. But the sleepy old Gov-
ernment doesn't care; the ; eminently respect-
able honorary committee of the Asylum
doesn’t care ; the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children doesn’t care; the innum-
erable Mothers’ Unions and Child Welfare
Associations don’t care. The general public
cares, but can’t be bothered. There are two
sad figures in this Australia of ours—a stray
dog and a Government orphan. I think I’d
rather be the dog—it has a sporting chance.

“Jean S.” : The trouble in the Vic. Artists’
Society, referred to by “The Bird” (B.
2/8/T7), is that the Meldrummers, headed
by the indomitable Max himself, have declared
war on the Potboilers who want to turn the
Society’s annual show into a bargain-sale.
Unquestionably the exhibitions in the past
have contained yards of rubbish, and it is
only natural that a hanging committee, in-
fused with Meldrum’s artistic enthusiasm,
should want to keep the soiled canvas from •
the public gaze. But the numerous amateurs
and others who have found it easy to fasten
their ineptitudes on the Society’s walls are
wildly resentful at a decision which compels
them to paint hard for recognition. Where-
fore they influenced “a want of confidence''
in President Max, which failed because his
position was legally impregnable. This defeat
must have caused a great deal of soreness—
at any rate. Max's fine picture of a peasant
in the National Gallery was mysteriously
knifed a day or two later. Despite threats
and hostility, however, Meldrum intends to
sit tight, and everybody who loves good art
will encourage him in that sedentary occupa-
tion. Through easy-going government in the
past the A’.A.S. had become nothing but a
cemetery, though it had many reasons—two
or three hundred annually in large gold
frames —for turning itself into a crema-
torium.
“Bank-clerk”: Life’s
little cheques! Coming
to the folio of James
Murphy, shingle-split-
ter, of Dingo Flat. I
make a fresh entry
against an already
sadly- overdrawn ac-
count and start remem-
bering. Two years ago,
with the perfume of the
bush clinging to his ill-
fitting suit, Jim breasted
the counter with a de-
posit to be placed on
his brand-new account.
A week later the first
cheque came in: “On
demand pay to Rev.
Brown, or order, the
sum of £5.” It was a
wedding fee. After that
we got orders to pay a
land-agent and a furni-
ture-warehouse. Months
slipped by. Then a
cheque with a shaky
signature fluttered to
the teller’s desk and a
doctor’s bill went
against Murphy’s
account. Later more
doctor’s bills. Jim
was excited when
he paid in his next
deposit. “She” was
very low and it
would be touch
and go with her when the baby arrived. His
hand shook as he signed the printed slip.
Poor Murphy ! To-day I enter a cheque in
favor of the local undertaker.

There has been a general round-up of
Adelaide’s fortune-tellers, who have been
battening cruelly on the credulity of women
with sons or husbands at the Front. The
new women-police, spinsters mostly, got the
evidence, along with some surprising infor-
mation about themselves and their families,
and the police-court welcomed from 20 to HO
“madams” and “professors,” mostly with
vaguely Asiatic trade-names. The defence
was varied. Some insisted that they had
“real occult powers,” and called on the name
of Oliver Lodge; others pretended to be
merely amusement-caterers, making no
charge, but inviting a subscription. It didn't
matter: it cost them £lO a head, whatever
they were.
EYES FRONT!
THE PEST: “Do you know it would be
awfully jolly if I were to keep you com-
pany!”
THE SOLDIER'S WIFE: “ Perhaps! But I
would rather you kept my husband com-
pany. He needs you more than I do."
ONE SPRING MORNING;
[FOR THE BULLIN.]
She took him from me in the Winter days,
When heavy earth pulls on its thinking cap ;
For she was versed in many learned ways,
And knowledge cloaked her like a rainproof wrap.
She had pale skin and hair as black as ink,
Dank from the stress of her eugenic brain,
Brows beetling o'er an eye that scorned a wink,
And thoughts that ran as smoothly as a train.
And I had only learned to kiss and cling,
And sparkle on about the everyday ;
Or listen when his mighty thoughts took wing,
And soared and swooped in politician way.
He left me for his intellectual mate;
I sat despondent by the fireside
Each evening, sighing for a heavy freight
Of brain equipment, till the embers died.
But through the streets Spring's pipes rang high this
morn,
A fanfare of boronia’s brown mirth ;
And Boy Blue wound his tasselled silver horn.
And laughter dimpled o'er the glad sea’s girth.
Then, radiant, I drew on transparent hose,
A muslin gown, hat leafy in the brim,
Tangling thereon the newest thing in beaus,
The while I walked the garden paths with him.
The chubby gods, in sun and vine-leaves clad,
Forgot that Winter rains had made them sneeze;
As silver marriage-bells all things were glad,
And little winds went fluting through the trees.
Till at a turning of the ways we met
My last year’s love and her in deep discourse—
At least, she talked with midnight brows that met,
And grim-set jaw, in tones that sounded hoarse.
He gazed at me. My heart went soaring high,
For she, disdaining dimity and dimples,
To greet the dancing radiance of the sky
Had come out in a macintosh —and pimples.

SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE. NURSE FRANCES, V.A.D., writes of Clements Tonic.
The proprietors of one of the leading weekly newspapers, Wellington, N.Z.. whose letter can be seen if necessary, writes:-
“Nurse Frances has just returned from the firing-line in France and used your Clements Tonic there, lm sure her
testimony is of very great public value.” Nurse Frances herself writes; "I snould like to tell you how very
pleased I am with your Tonic as a nerve restorer. I have used it with very beneficial results. Several of our
nurses in France have also proved its worth. I can highly recommend it to any one suffering from brain-tag.'

■‘3 0 3": Why continue the cruel and
wasteful practice of shipping wheat in the
form of grain, instead of sending complete
cargoes of flour? Laden with flour a vessel
with the ordinary number of watertight com-
partments could not be sunk by any shell-
fire from a submarine, and, if torpedoed,
would float for days. Such a vessel, if armed,
would become a floating, unsinkable battery
quite long enough to knock the inside out
of any U-boat. Wheat sinks instantly. The
advantages of gristing here need no mention,
yet they are, comparatively speaking, trifles.
Let any Bulletin reader who doesn’t mind
spoiling a little flour take a biscuit-tin full,
knock or shoot a hole in it and then drop the
remains in a tub of water. Next morning
ho will find the food afloat, and the morning
after it will be still bobbing up. He will
he forced to admit that as a shock-absorber
and water-resister wheaten flour is incom-
parable. Pollard is not so good for the ex-
periment and bran no good at all.
“Chevron”: Reading how 103 former
patients of the Lara (Vic.) Inebriate Re-
treat had gone to the Front, Henry Law-
son’s knack of unconscious prophecy again
struck me. You remember his verses :
....and a widow’s son is he,
And the widow she drank before ho was born —-
(Keep step, One Hundred and Three!)
The drums they are beating far and low, and
The footstep’s light and free,
And the angels are whispering over his bed,
“Keep step, One Hundred and Three!”
And well have they kept it. Seven have
marched up to a greater Bar than any they
breasted in life, and “one by one crept
silently to rest.”
The rough-and-tumble between Pemberton
Billing and a lieut.-colonel outside the House
of Commons was highly suggestive of the
relations between the Military and Aviation
departments. Fifteen months ago Billing,
the vulgah agitator, at last succeeded in get-
ting aeroplane construction and the training
of air-fighters placed under a new control,
unshackled by military or naval domination
or jealousy. Since then, of course, ho has
been more than ever a “ead.” He was cast-
ing reflections on the Military dispatches, in
relation to aviatory matters probably, when
the gallant Colonel called him a—ah—
beastly ead. arid started the row. It’s an
awful thing to he a critic of Military man-
agement in any particular, and a positive
outrage when the critic is a champion of
the parvenu service which is now said to be
the only service that can win the war. The
wonder is that the Colonel didn’t kill the
fellow outright with a glance of scorn.
“Karee” : “Exile” recently wrote from the
TT.S.A. to inform The Bulletin that no true
Australian can be made out of a man not
horn on the continent. He reckoned that a
foreigner might be loyal or grateful to the
adopted country which had been good and
kind to him, but that
he couldn’t love it. I
was born a foreigner,
but, realising my mis-
take. came to Australia
with my brothers 15
years ago. During the
first three, spent in .Mel-
bourne. I was an alien
in every sense, not car-
ing a blanky for Aus-
tralia or its inhabitants,
and if I could have
raised the fare I’d have
imshied double-quick.
Then, with my brothers,
I went into the Queens-
land bush, and —well, it
got me. its ways, its
men. its life, and I be-
lieve I’ve been a “din-
kum” ever since. Aus-
tralia is so much part
of me that, when I
sighted Fremantle the
other day, it was all I
could do not to weep for
joy. I was coming
home, and the bush was
calling me with a voice
that couldn’t be denied !
Most of my countrymen
whom I’ve induced to
come out have been simi-
larly affected. The
townies have remained
aliens, but the sensible ones who've gone
outback have become as Australian, in
thought, spirit, and some in looks, as the
native-born article.
“Tahmac”: I had written a letter for a
mate who could not read or write. We could
not find an envelope in any of the camp huts,
so I told him to buy some when he went to
the store and get somebody to address one
for him. We met later, and I asked : “Did you
post the letter, Ted?” He looked at me
despairingly. “Yes, but. ’struth. I forgot to
put the res'reetion on it!”
“Country Ped” : See it in any paper you
pick up : “Wanted, Office Boy. One just left
school preferred. Wages 20s. per week.”
And a junior teacher in Victoria, after
spending from two to three years in a high
school, and passing educational and medical
examinations, gets just 15s. 4|d. per week, or
£4O a year, which the Education Depart-
ment fatuously calls 16s. Sd.
a week, reckoning 12 months
in the year and four weeks
in a month. Of course, it
is cruel sweating. Most of
these juniors, owing to the
shortage of teachers, are
doing the work of assistants
who should get three times
the salary. Yet in telling
a recent deputation that
lady teachers would prob-
ably have their screws raised
to four-fifths of the pay of
the men in the same class,
the Minister of Education
never remembered the juni-
ors, and the selfish deputa-
tion did not remind him.
Does the Vic. Education De-
partment think it is going
to pin down its bright, am-
bitious youngsters with the
wage of a raw office kid?
The present policy is a bid
for the slow young man who
doesn’t help Jack to be a
bright boy.

“See Gee” : Poor cocky!
Babbit-proof netting of the
gauge most in use has leapt
to £B5 10s. a mile. Before
the war it was £26 Ss. At
the rate it’s going it will hit
a century in three months.
Meanwhile the shutting of
most of the country freezing
works owing to few ships
and congested-storage space
has put the trapper out of
business. So cocky in the
rabbit country is getting it
with both barrels. Gazing
round to see what’s coming
next, the badly-bumped old
bird has discovered that he is likely to
be presented with a plague of snakes that
have been doing quite well on cheap mice
meat. The ploughs have been turning them
up in scores.
From one of them :
While waiting at Adelaide for the arrival of. her
hubby, chief engineer on a returning transport, a
jolly Yictorienne with a heart to match put in her
time at The Hut. Soldier boys drifted in and out
all day long, and she made friends with every one
of them. One funereal-faced Billjim asked her to
translate the letters “V.A.D.” on the badge she was
wearing. “Voluntary Aid. Detachment,” said she.
SAORIFICE.
THE BOSS: “What! In times like these you
want an increase in your salary!"
THE CRAVEN WRETCH : “But, sir, I've got
a wife and a large family."
THE BOSS: “You hare, hare you? Well, look
at me — I’m doing without either.”
“H’m,” he said solemnly, “then they wnz pullin’
me leg!” “Why, what did they tell you it meant?”
she asked. He hesitated. Then said he, in a burst
of soldierly frankness, “Virgins and Doubtfuls!”
PREJUDICIAL TO RECRUITING.
“The worst is to happen. Spring frocks have the
maddening hooks-and-eves that are supposed to fasten
invisibly down the back.”
"Bat, darling, if you go away I shall hare to
be just an old-fashioned frump."
“0.K.”: The stories of the achievements
of the latest Australasian winners of the
Y.C. sound like fairy tales. All three of
them had big bags of Huns to their credit,
in addition to records of usefulness in
destroying mechanical means of destruction.
The biggest bag was secured by Lance-Corp.
Frickleton, of Maoriland. He was already
wounded when he personally bombed and
destroyed a machine-gun which was causing
heavy casualties. Then he attacked a second
machine-gun, killing the whole of the crew
of 12. After polishing off the round dozen
of Germans lie was more seriously wounded.
It is exasperating to think that the army
which contains such men may. after all, be
found to have battled in vain against an
enemy that scored all its triumphs in the
first three weeks of the war, against forces
comparatively weak and unprepared. Ger-
man militarism made headway on the West-
ern Front for just as long as the odds were
5 to 1 in its favor, and not a day longer.
The maddening lesson of the war is in the
fact that swaggering militarism, being
checked by superior valor, could fall back
on positions almost impregnable—in the ter-
ritory so easily invaded. The Gott of Battles
cares not a dump, seemingly, for the Cause
of Civilisation, or the survival of the fittest,
or the justification of simple bravery which
doesn't put up its hands and whine
“kamerad” when death threatens. Gott is
on the side of carefully-prepared Frightful-
ness which gets in first blow with the heavi-
est stick on the market. So militarism will
continue to crush until it is crushed, and
in the meantime “International” Socialism
is just talking through its long neck.
“Karee” : Re the shirkers in the Defence
Department. The same applies to all
command depots in England and France.
In spite of an occasional raid, most of
the breed are sheltered and kept on as
“indispensables,” while Cl men, fit to replace
them in their cosy billets, shiver around
the camps, picking up papers or doing so-
called “fatigues.” Take my own case. Being
boarded Cl, after nearly three years’ sei’-
vice, and wishing to carry on. I applied
to go back to the Front on the Intelligence
Staff, where I thought my knowledge of
four languages would be of use in the work,
which is mainly that of a clerk cum ’tec.,
cum interpreter. (It is only open to C
class or elderly poilus in the French army.)
My application was refused on the grounds
of my not being A class! And insult was
added to injury by the suggestion that I
should apply for a job on our ‘‘bird cages” ;
though they failed to explain why a C-elass
man was deemed lit to cope with F.P. No. 1
prisoners while deemed unfit for clerical
work.
“Bogan”: The mouse is bad enough, but
his small red lodger the flea is worse.
Examine a mouse carefully and you will see
that he is covered with these small vermin.
In the plague districts some people have
contracted a sore from them. It may appear
on any part of the body, and it is now evi-
dent that the insects come diseased from the
mice and so pass the trouble on. The sore,
which takes the form of a ringworm, only
much bigger, lasts for some time. I have
known cases where the sufferers have had to
remain in bed.
“Manilla”: I’m the chaplain of this
transport. Just before sailing, two cases of
comforts, plainly labelled as such and ad-
dressed to the 0.C.. were put aboard. When
we were on our way we found that both
cases had been cleverly broached before leav-
ing Sydney and many pairs of socks stolen.
I’m trying to persuade myself that the thief
couldn’t read.
GONE EITHER WAY.
ADAM: “Ere lost two of my best girl friends.”
EVE: “How's that?"
ADAM : “Well, I asked them both to marry
me. One said no and the other yes."
BETRAYED.

“I would not have you think,” said he.

The few members of the Federal Parlia-

Honor, not brother.” And the horrible word
was said again, a little louder. “Yes, yes. I
heard —he said he was his brother.” And so
it went on until nearly everybody in the
staid old Equity Court was roaring the had
word. In his day Simpson was a fine Equity
man, and he did good service to the State in
his 21 years on the Bench —and at last good
service also in retiring from it at the age
of 74.
HER THRIFT CAMPAIGN.
HE: “Hullo, new furs! I thought you were
practising economy .”
SHE: “So I am. You see, with these furs I
don't have to put new fasteners on my
blouse .”
When making his debut as Speaker of the
Westralian Legislative Assembly, “Mulga"
Taylor electrified his old associates by dress-
ing the part down, or up, to the full-bot-
tomed wig. It is understood that “Mulga re-
ceived instructions from his commanding
officer. Mrs. Taylor is Major of the
Women's Khaki Defence Corps, an absurd
organisation which, attired in Anzac slouch
hat (and other things), endeavors to chase
the eligible but unwilling male to the re-
cruiting office.
“E.” : When they are patriots at'all they’re
practical patriots in the Territory. And
there are very few indeed of the white
women who are anything else. One such
battler, down with fever, was removed by
rail to the Darwin Hospital. As she did not
seem to be rallying a young priest was called.
But when his
Reverence su g-
ges t e d prayers
the patient perked
u p an d ex-
claimed: “None
of your prayers
for me! - Better
you don khaki at
the Front and
fight for yo u r
country !” Th e
shock of being in-
vited to prayers
by a young, able-
bodied man so
' roused the high-
minded lady that
she promptly
shook off her
malady, took up
her “port” and
shifted to the
hotel.

Another Adelaide lawyer to seek active
service is Stanley Skipper, son of the “Hugh
Ivalyptus” of the last generation of journal-
ists. lie had a spell on Home service; then
qualified at Duntroon for a commission. He
went into camp Hast week with “Jim”
Vaughan, lately Attorney-General.
Just-dead Bob Nicolson. manager of the
big Ivanhqe mine. ‘(W.A.) —he passed out
from the effects of a driving accident —-was
one of the five sons of late Vic. Magistrate
C. 11. Nicolson who helped to capture Power
the bushranger and was also'up and doing at -
the time of the Kelly gang. The Nicolson boys
were on Coolgardie early, and ever' since
have been interested in mining. Bob was
most successful as manager of the Ivanhoe :
for he was a likable man and a just
boss. In his earlier days he was a fine
oarsman and footballer. He married one of
the late Dr. .Gray’s numerous pretty
daughters.
Staked out his last claim, at 78. George
Campbell Meredith, one of the first prospec-
tors on the Tasmanian West Coast. In
November. ’7O. ■he and his brother Owen
k ft Emu Bay in the schooner Secret for the
Pieman River. Being unable to enter the
Pieman, they landed at Macquarie Harbor
and set out overland. Taking a week's
provisions they just managed the trip—
the first party to, do it. Meredith erected
the first sluice-box on the West Coast
at the Pieman in '7B. and on March 0.
’7B, the first miner's right for the coast was
issued to him by the late C. I’. Sprent.
Meredith’s discoveries led to the finding of
Brown's Plains and Middleton's Creek, the
first two gold rushes on the coast. He cut
many of the tracks, and in 'B3. with brother
Owen, pitched the first tent on what is now
Strahan.
There probably never was a wilderness
that didn’t appeal to some men above all
other places on earth. In the earliest days
of Silverton J. C. Dobbyn was accountant of
the Bank of Australasia. When Colin Tem-
pleton went on to help the Queen-street mag-
nates make more millions and Stubbs passed
to Melbourne, Dobbyn took over the Broken
Hill branch, and for 25 years he has resisted
all offers of a change. Even now. on his re-
tirement, he remains in the shelter of the
Broken Hill Club. There are dozens more
who. after tasting dusty Broken Hill,
have tried other parts and drifted back —
like Smethurst, managing editor of the local
Miner —and have only sympathy for the
people who have to live anywhere else.
A Victorian grocer formally notified the
world last week that he had shed his name
of Ludwig Ivugelmann and would be known
as Love Wisdom Power. A keener adver-
tiser would have tacked on “Andy 1 rompt
Settlements.”
“Dick” Windeyer has taken silk, after
wearing stuff for 23 years. He is the eldest
son of the late Justice Windeyer, and the
17th K.C. in X. S. Wales, not counting G. f •
Wade, in England, and Bruce Smith, who
seldom holds a brief.
Parson T. E. Ruth, of Collins-street,
wants public men in opposing camps to drop
the policy of recrimination, and confess all
their sins to each other.
But would we hear as much of ill
If each of these good brothers
Confessed his sins, instead of still
Confessing all the others’ ?
The cruel luck of it. Mervyn Waller was
an art student in Melbourne when war broke
out. He had. as a small boy. a remarkable
facility with a pencil. But. being the son
of a busy dairyman at Peiishurst (\ic.), lit*
often had to dodge the milking to steal time
for sketching. IJis father, seeing that he
would not be cured of his passion, sent him
to Melbourne to study, and during h;s.firs/
year be won 10 first and two second prizes
in 12 competitions. Then came the eaII for
men. He enlisted and up till recently re-
mained whole. Now news arrives that he
has lost his right arm.
“Flaneur”: Billjim would hardly be
classed as an enthusiastic heroXvorshipper;
but no soldier more quickly recognises a
leader. On a recent journey to El Arish
every Australian I met. officers, N.C.O.’s and
men, spoke of nothing but the extraordinary
exploits of General Royston at Magdaba and
Rafa. It is the same story from all men who
have been on the Sinai Front. Notwith-
standing all this praise, the only printed
reference I have seen to the gallant General
since my return occurs in “Gerardy’s” poem,
“South‘of Gaza” (B. 2(5/7/’l7). I wish
some Billjim who saw Royston at Magdaba
and Rafa would tell the Australian public
the story. It rings and clatters like a
mediaeval romance.
“1222”: I nominate Reg Ffrench as
another swift candidate in the run for the
f.m.'s baton. Five years ago he left Dal-
gety’s Sydney shipping office to watch wool
grow near the Bananaland border. He heard
the bugle’s first blast and enlisted as a pri-
vate in the A.S.C., transferred to the 4th
Battalion (inf.), acquired one star, was hit in
the shoulder at Krithia, and earned his
second star. After the Evacuation he
studied machine-guns, got his company soon
after reaching France, earned the M.C. at
I'ozicres and was promoted Major. He is
still trying to push Mad Bill back into his
asylum. A
SIR FRANCIS NEWDIGATE-
NEWDEGATE, Tasmania's New Governor.
Passed out at 81. Edward Solomon, father
of the late A. E. Solomon, formerly Premier
of Tasmania. Solomon, sen., was born in
England, but came to the Apple Island when
quite a boy. For 25 years he lived and kept
shop at Longford, where bis family of five
sons and three daughters were born; and
for the rest he had a record of 50 years’
local preaching in the Methodist tabernacle.

steam-engine paintings for Henry Steven-
son are his chief delightful memories, most
Australians, however, know nun. best by his
pictures on the last edition of Tasmanian
postage stamps—blanket size—which were
called in when the Commonwealth stamp
was adopted. Captain Forest’s son is an
artillery officer, and one grandson has been
killed and three are still in the trenches.
Julius Superbus Knight isn’t the only one.
In spare moments Mr. Justice Shand (Q.)
has been knitting socks for soldiers ever
since the war began.
“Pamphile” : This is the sort. The Rev.
Sam W. McKibbin, for many months a
Y.M.C.A. secretary in Egypt and France,
has been lecturing on “Lights and Shades of
War” round the X. S. Wales Northern
Rivers. At little Clunes 150 settlers turned
up and shelled out £2lO ; at Bora Ridge an
audience of 50 brought £180; at Bun-
gawalbyn a handful of 50 sparked up £250.
McKibbin is real Australian, telling his yarn
hi a way Australians want to hear it, and in
a few weeks he lias done more to win the
Avar (proceeds are for the Y.M.C.A. field
work) than half the whole hungry mob of
windy 1 ‘arliamentarians.

FIRST FLIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLIN.]
In yon stern camp of men,
So near to me and yet so far asunder
That Time may never bridge the gulf again,
Will you forget me, little boy, I wonder?
Wifi you forget, forget,
In your hot haste to drain full manhood’s measure,
The rainbow days with pretty follies set—
The tender things that little children treasure?
Ah bitter, bitter-sweet
The withered garlands plucked by baby fingers,
In whose pale ashes falling round my feet
Some half-forgotten scent of morning lingers!
Yea, bitter, bitter-sweet
The little season of a mother’s keeping;
Then the wild bugles blowing in the street....
And Love’s dark night, Love’s long dark night of
weeping!
The mills of God grind 510 w....
Peace, peace, poor souls in man-toils darkly wind-
ing !
The mills of God grind very, very slow,
But what shall ’scape the grinding?

So the Commercial of Sydney has got back
to within a thousand or two of the profit
shown in the half-year immediately prior to
the world’s great catastrophe. That it might
now have shown considerably more is highly
probable, in view of these figures:—

Premises . . 568,253 588,943 600,343
Deposits are thus £3,278,007 more than they
were three years ago; and although practi-
cally the whole lot is current account money
and is held liquid, 1$ million of it is earning
something for the bank. Also there is
£212,000 more undivided profit now at work.
But, as might have been expected, “ample
provision has been made for depreciation of
investments and all probable losses and con-
tingencies” ; and. as contingencies are large
things to provide for in the present state of
affairs in Australia, one need not go any
further for an explanation of why the visible
profit has not increased more rapidly.
As usual this bank’s position is very
strong; the liquid items, including Govern-
ment securities, represent no less than 12s.
in the £ of all liabilities. Even allowing
for the fact that the current account balances
are exceptionally large, the Commercial of
Sydney is clearly holding itself in a position
to stand by its customers when the pinch
comes, as come it almost inevitably must.
As the chairman told shareholders, “rigid
economy must be practised to enable the
country to bear the enormously heavy bur-
den of debt it will have to carry owing to
war and other heavy expenditure.” The
immediate trouble is that our usual markets
are not open to us. and they threaten to be
less open still. How the producer who can-
not find a market is to be financed is the
problem ahead of us; for if he can’t keep
going then most of the rest of the commu-
nity will be in Queer-street. In ordinary cir-
cumstances the new burden of debt would be
serious enough. In the extraordinary cir-
cumstances we shall have to exercise all our
wits to pull through without serious trouble.
This makes the wisdom of rigid economy all
the greater. The man who has a bit in hand
is the man who is least likely to feel sorry
for himself presently.

You couldn’t reasonably ask for much better
progress than that. Term after term, with
scarcely a break, the management shows
things just a little better than they were last
time. And so they ought to be. judging by
the other figures of the bank. Take the pro-
gress since the Devil broke loose:

The A.B.C. has thus been favored with
£607,145 more of the public’s money (mostly
deposits), and it has found employment for
£330,521 in further advances. This is really
the side of the business which the A.B.C.
needed to cultivate. It took a while to break
down old prejudices. For many years hardly
anybody turned into tlie A.B.C.—or, rather,
its predecessor, the A.J.S. —if he wanted to
borrow money on good security and didn’t
want to be harried so long as he was steadily
improving his position.
The two institutions —the old and the new
—couldn’t be much more unlike. One was
making coffins ; the other is much more in-
terested in cradles. One Was liquidating;
the other is all the time looking for new men
who want help to make. money for them-
selves, and, incidentally, the bank. And the
A.B.C. is able to make a. strong appeal to
that sort of man. He wants a concern
which (1) won’t be likely to worry him as
soon as general conditions are a little bit
gloomy, and (2) will be able to extend its
assistance as his circumstances warrant.
Apart from the inscribed deposits—which
are, with a small reservation, perpetual—the
bank owes £3,929,865, and it has £2,006,766
liquid. This means that it hasn’t reached
the limit of its lending capacity even on its
present resources. Further, and again dis-
regarding inscribed deposits, reckoning them
neither as capital nor as liabilities, the co.
owes £3,929,865, while its own funds (capi-
tal and reserves) are £1,315,438; so it owes
less than £3 for every £1 of its own. Which
means that it is nowhere near the limit of its
safe borrowings; it could very comfortably
take (and, of course, make use of) another
five or six millions of deposits; and there is
no reason whatever to expect that it won’t
be able to find the money as it is wanted.
A reference was made just now to the in-
scribed deposits and their permanent charac-
ter “with a small reservation.” These de- #
posits, which carry 4 p.c., have to be re-'
deemed at the rate of £15,000 per half-year;
but not necessarily out of profit. At present
they are not being redeemed out of profit,
and so long as the assets have been well
written down —as they certainly were a few
years ago—and so long as there is an ade-,
quate contingency fund inside, there is no
reason why they should be paid out of pro-
fits.

The reserves of £(571,765 are made up in
this way:—
Premiums on shares . . £558,330
General reserves .. 43,634
Meter renewal fund .. 9,292
Unappropriated profit . . 60,509
This is another case that raises the question
whether cos. which are permitted to supply
public utilities should be entitled to capital-
ise reserves. But it is not the worst sort
of case. The worst sort is that of which
Sydney Ferries is an example, the reserves
capitalised consisting for the most part of
profits which the co. has not thought it ad-
visable to disclose. That can’t be said of
the Metropolitan Gas, whose accounts have
stated plainly what new works have been
paid for out of revenue. What the aggre-
gate is now this paper has no idea; but in
the past half-dozen years £357,605 has been
thus invested. In other words, in six years,
besides paying the dividend of 13 p.c. (most
of the time), the public has (1) paid for the
renewal and replacement of all worn-out
plant, etc., which is a quite proper thing for
the public to do; (2) provided £BB.OOO for
contingencies, and, though liberal, that isn’t
much out of the way either; and (3) paid
for £357,605 of new works, which is a
grossly unfair thing to ask the public to do,
provided a fair dividend has been paid. In
any case, if the shareholders have been
fairly entitled to a larger dividend, then in
a case of this kind the public interest de-
mands that they should get it openly as a
dividend, and not more or less clandestinely
as an addition to the capital value of their
undertaking. The public knows that it is
paying 13 p.c. dividend. What it doesn t
know is that the co. has been getting slightly
over 6 p.c. more, and has been adding that
to its internal reserves. And the public ought
to know. Just as it ought to know also that
the 33 p.c. isn’t really 13 p.c. at all, because
of the £558,330 of premium capital. Add
that in and the dividend is really a shade
under 8] p.c., which is much nearer a fair
thing than 13 p.c. The undivided profit is,
year in and year out, about one-lialf the
amount of that divided profit.
The obvious effect of paying for new
revenue-producing works out of profit with-
out capitalising it is to inflate the reventie
in proportion to capital. This comparison
shows that feature :
1907. 1917.
Total outlay charged to capital £2,171,745 £2,472,540
Total revenue . . .. .. 208,965 451,366
Revenue p.c. of capital outlay 9.6 18.2
This isn’t a satisfactory way of doing things :
and the sooner the co. has its finances put
on a better footing the less it will have to
fear an injustice some day. A co., operating
a public utility, on which industry very
largely depends, is only courting trouble
when it snows an increase in 10 years of
over half a million in revenue on a capital
expenditure of £301,000.
In addition to the profits put into new
works substantial revenue is written off
against depreciation—money spent on re-
pairs, maintenance and renewals. Last half-
year these items ran to £77,475 exclusive of
cost of repairing meters and stoves. This
is a solid £lO,OOO more than usual. It may
be interesting to hunt up some of the
changes in the revenue account (figures are
for half-year) :

And that is altogether satisfactory: for it
means using up waste products, and Aus-
tralia needs to learn to do that more than
almost anything else. On the other side
coal now costs £3BO for every £lOO it cost
in 1900. while the gross revenue has in-
creased from £lOO to £290. “Other manu-
facturing exes.” and “distribution”—practi-
cally all labor costs—have increased from
£lOO to £390. Or put it this way. £lOO
worth of coal produced £415 of revenue in
1900 and £309 in 1917; £lOO spent on
other manufacturing exes.” and “distribu-
teoll” almost all labor costs—produced
(helped by coal, etc.) £471 of gross revenue
in 1900 and £340 in 1917. Unfortunately
it isnt possible to say how much of this
variation has been due to higher wages and
bow much (if any) to loss of efficiency.

The capital is £105.000, in shares fully paid
to 15s.—they were written down when the
co. was re-registered in 1900. The whole
of the capital is therefore now represented
by war loan (£10,000) or sundry debtors

Much, of course, depends on the big com-

If that or any large part of it is earning «
decent return, then the co. ought to be able
to add enough from its manufacturing and
trading operations, even in a dull .time to
keep a modest dividend going. The strenu-
ous writing-down of plant in recent mr«
will be a help.

M’yes; the profit for the half-year was £3
less than the dividend ; or, if you deduct the
amount which the directors put aside for the
insurance of steamers, the profit was only
£12,115. Altogether, in .fact, on its own
showing, the co. is going to the dogs.' “Net
profits’’ term by term have been as follows:
Dec., 1915 ..£13,936 I Dec., 1916 ..£l2 317
June, 1916 .. 11,623 | June, 1917 .. 12*115
But they don’t say. how much revenue they
have written off ostensibly against deprecia-
tion. This, however, gives a hint or two:—
Dec., ’l3. Dec., ’l6. June, T 7.
Assets other than steamers,
freehold and plant ..£70,737 £110,697 £118,701
Liabilities . . .. 2,2 4 7 1,7 9 0 2*067
Surplus liquid assets £68,490 £108,907 £116,634
So in the past six months, though a divi-
dend has been paid at the rate of 13$ p. CI
p.a., and though this is supposed to have
consumed more than all the net profit, the
co. has put by £7727 in cash. And in 3$
years it has put by £48.144. Thus the aver-
age of about £7OOO per half- year is being
well maintained. Meantime there has, of
course, been some depreciation of vessels;
but not as much as one might think, because
of the very fine order in which these ships
are kept—it is extremely doubtful whether
in all the world better could be
found. Also, the co. is probably carrying
some of its own insurance risk. But throw-
ing all that in, the co. is doing extraordinarily
well; and all the better when it is remem-
bered that of the present capital of £211,212,
on which the 13$ p.c. dividend is being
paid, only £45,000 was put up by the share-
holders—£2s,oo<T in shares and £20,000 origi-
nally in debentures and afterwards converted
into share capital. By comparison the Syd-
ney Ferries is a poor, struggling concern.
Yet the Manly service is pointed to by Syd-
ney _ Ferries’ passengers as a bright and
shining example. The fact is that the Manly
Co. doesn’t spend any money on pioneering
lines. All its traffic is on one line, and all
of it is through traffic. It would be hard to
find another big Sydney co. on a better
wicket. No doubt it has its risks. A bad
accident might cost it many thousands. And
as time goes on the disposition will always
he to squeeze more and more out of it for
the use of the indispensable jetties at either
end of the run.

We agree with the Secretary of the Automobile Club

round. there are probably no Australian
wheat farmers who have done better during
the past 15 years than those north of “War-
rack”; and their success in Victoria has been
followed by the opening up of hundreds of
thousands of S. Australian acres which had
previously been regarded as desert or there-
abouts.
The co. was born at an unfortunate time.
It had scarcely started when West and Nor’-
\\ est Victoria was hit by its worst drought.
That meant a knock-out for more than one
year: for stock losses were so serious that
the wool-clip could not possibly recover for
at least four seasons. In the last year of
the old firm it handled 51,728 bales; in
1913-14 the co. sold 45,817 ; 1914-15. 40,725;
1915-16, 32.274; 1916-17. 43,884. Fortu-
nately for the co. the war sent the price
sky-roeketting. Last year’s clip was sold
at 154 d. ex warehouse for f.a.q., with a
system of appraisement which meant that
the best wool brought more. In the final
result the average price was rather in excess
of 15£d.. the quality being better than had
been reckoned on. The current clip the
British Government buys on the same terms.
It is the easiest commission these firms have
ever earned, probably. The most astonish-
ing feature of the whole business is that,
though the purchase is directly due to the
war, and though the price has been as plainly
affected by special war demands as anything
could be, the Commonwealth Government
could see only £400,000 of war profits to
recover. On a conservative estimate the
pastoral industry of Australia -alone has
nmde and continues to make £4.-000.000 a
year of war profits. But presumably these
are interests which, on the confession of the
Sydney Telegraph, the Government re-
frains from touching for fear of losing poli-
tical support. It would be bad enough that
Australian politics have become so morally
corrupt; it is worse that Australian journal-
ism has so degenerated that, after making
such a confession, it can continue to support
such a Government.
Capital is £150.000; and the co. owes
£78,479. Against that it has £75.314 in
freeholds, £102.967 in book debts. £5OOO in
a motor business, and £4076 in stock, cash
and sundries. The balance, £50,000, is still
represented by goodwill. The future depends
largely on management; and what the co.
paid the £50.000 for is largely the result of
the business capacity of men who are no
longer able to give the co. the benefit of their
services. Perhaps the best assurance the co.
has of continued prosperity lies in the fact
that of its 150.000 shares 101,200 are held
by customers. That at least ought to guaran-
tee the co. a turnover. For the rest it can
look forward with a good deal of confidence
to the continued development of that part
of Victoria in which it is well established.
That great district has little more than
begun to be productive yet. How far it will
go depends largely upon the rational in-
ducements which are held out to men to
take up country life. Hitherto there have
been more discouragements than induce-
ments.

The N. 8. Wales Government expects to
get this year about £200.000 from income tax.
It is nearly time there was an inquiry into
the failure of this tax to produce more
money. The director of any honest public
company who knows what his own concern
is paying will, when he compares its pay-
ments with the total, be convinced, either
that his co. is vastly more important in
the commerce of the State than he thought
it was, or that scores of other people are
dodging the tax.
“G. Arden Hill” from a N.S.W. coalfield:
Despite the Uoal Board, which was appointed
under the War Precautions Act to maintain harmony
in the industry, irritating sectional stoppages still
occur in the Northern and Southern districts. The
miners manifest only a casual interest in the pon-
derous deliberations of Boards, commissions, special
tribunals, conciliation committees, etc. This one
thing they know: after waiting for years for legis-
lative action, and listening to incessant wrangling
that always ended in a shuffle, the miners did not
get eight hours until they took it themselves. True,
this reform was ratified by Judge Edmunds after
the men had defied Hughes and his ballot proposals ;
but the fact stands clear that they took it them-
selves in the first place, and would brook no com-
promise or delay. And the same spirit pervades
them to-day. They are tired of cumbersome investi-
gations and so forth, and have got into the habit,
whenever a grievance crops up, of ceasing work as
the only prompt and effective way of remedying it.
Judge Edmunds speaks of punitive action under
the War Precautions Act. The men smile: they
know such a step is impracticable. These sec-
tional stoppages are not one-man or two-men affairs.
It would be just as sensible to attempt to intern the
lodge behind barbed-wire as to put all the members
that constitute it in gaol.
The lawq then, being impotent to establish peace
in this great industry, are there no other means by
which this desirable end might be attained ? The
writer has swung a pick at tl coal face and has
lived in a coal-mining community all his life. And
since he was a wondering kid he cannot remember
a period of tranquillity in the industry. He is
convinced that the only way to eliminate this chronic
unrest is to abolish the contract system. It is the
cause, directly and indirectly, of fully 90 per cent,
of the grievances that dislocate the trade. It pits
the men against each other and creates discord and
distrust; it encourages selfishness and avarice; it
foments perpetual strife and bitter recrimination. It
is the bane of a great primary industry. Pay every
man who toils at the coal face a definite daily
wage commensurate with the importance and danger
of the work, and in the course of time these bicker-
ings and trade dislocations will vanish. At first
there would be a howl about diminished output; but
the new system would produce better men, and that
spirit in the end would mean more conscientious
work.
Said recently that Hugh Mahon, ex-Min-
ister, had been appointed sec. of an associa-
tion to watch the interests of mineowners,
especially in matters affected by Government
action. Mr. Mahon says it isn’t true.
The most likely-looking thing of late on
the old Hill End (N.S.W.) field is the strik-
ing of a useful vein in the Central at the
700 ft. level, where driving shows the stone
to be Sin. to lOin. wide. Some of the stuff
has gone up to lOoz., but the average is put
at 2£oz., which is highly payable. The
neighboring Hawkins’ Reward has been able
to rub along on under an ounce got less
easily. The Central Co. has 250.000 3s.
shares, 200,000 fully-paid and 50,000 paid
to Is. 6d.
Abercrombie Copper Mines, Ltd., which
now owns the old Lloyd mine, Burraga
(N.S.W.), has a capital of £30,000 in
60,000 shares of 10s.; but only 35,535 have
been issued. There are no promoters’ shares,
and no commissions were paid on the forma-
tion of the present co. at the end of last
year. Holders are mostly people who were
in the old Lloyd co.: they had first call on
the shares. So far, the new concern hasn’t
had much luck; for just when everything
was ready to start on production excessively
wet weather prevented a supply of fuel. 11.
Schroder, formerly manager of the E. and A.
Copper works, Newcastle, is general mana-
ger, and he has carried out an extensive
programme of plant additions and altera-
tions. The proposal is to mill 100 tons of
ore and 150 tons of slag a day. The treat-
ment of several thousand tons of slag has
shown an average copper content of 2.3 p.c.,
and Schroder looks for a 60 p.c. to 70 p.c.
extraction. With an 85 p.c. extraction from
the ore (34 p.c.), he figures on a total out-
put of 80 to 100 tons copper per
month. The furnaces are ready to
handle sufficient concentrate to do this.
The co. sees money also in the old
tailings, which are reckoned at 130.000 tons,
worth 1.1 p.c. The general manager believes,
after many tests, that 65 p.c. of the metal
(‘an be recovered —say, 850 tons of copper.
He recommends a separate unit of tube
mills, with a flotation plant, costing, say.
£2500. Thus handled, he sees a profit of
£40.000 or more in these tailings, with copper
at £lOO a ton. But the co. isn’t flush of
money, and it will probably have to earn a
bit before the dumps are turned over.
Adelong Estates (N.S.W.) comes along
with another Is., raising the total to ss. On
the 75.000 shares 225. has been paid up
(£82,500). so the shilling (£3750) is a very
gradual return of capital. The debenture
debt has been wiped off, and the splendid re-
turns from No. 2 dredge have provided a
substantial credit balance. No. 2 estab-
lished a record with 3170 z. lOdwt. for 125
hours, other yields being 2260 z. lOdwt. for
126 hours, and 1360 z. for 127 hours. No. 1
dredge has been recently saving from 520 z.
to 90oz. per week.
Last month’s work at Teddy Dyason’s
Bendigo group gave 31140 z. from 11,471
tons. This won’t set the Beehive buzzing.
Good ore showed up at Koch’s 2040 main
north, level, but over the level values have
shaded off a lot. This has been markedly
the case at the 1940 ft. level north, where
the co. took over the block out of which the
tributors had done so well. A shot is being made
farther overhead to see if values go up. At
the Sea better stone is making, and at the
Cornish there seems to be a hope that the
Victory spurs will turn into something pro-
mising. But the biggest job ahead is the
testing of the Ironbark and Central Blue
reefs at 840 ft. from the Hercules east shaft,
the incentive being the gold got out of the
Lansell’s ISO mine near by.
The North Powlett coal show (Vic.) js
earning profits at last. It takes over 850
tons a week to get ahead of costs, so the new
man. H. L. Stead, is pushing things. In the
past year 21,000 tons worth £14,157 were
mined. This was not payable, as wages
took £14.345 and £3547 had to be written off
plant. With public finances so bad in Vic-
toria, it might have been expected that the
Treasury would have been hunting after the
£BOOO the co. owes the Government; but the
Minister is going to cut out interest and let
the co. get ahead of things a little before in-
instalments. Calls in the year
were £5OOO, and even then there were little
bills for over £lBOO outstanding at the
balance. A\ ith coal at present price the co.
ought to screw itself out’of debt if it gets a
fair run. But there must be no stop-work
nonsense.
South German. Maldon (Vic.), nowadays
is grateful for small things. From a claim
that paid £341,000 in divs. from a £700,000
output, sdwt. to 15dwt. stone doesn’t seem
m y e h to pin a revival of fortunes on,, especi-
ally as' the stone has been followed for only
80ft. Nevertheless manager Williams does
hang his hat on to this make in the 1750 ft.
level, where he has from Oft. to 10ft. of nice-
looking stone. The Bulletin thinks his
“more prosperous future” depends on a lot
more work being carried out here, as well as
his getting into the shallow levels.
Bob Stuckey now guarantees the repay-
ment of the Edna Deeps’ £9500 debenture
debt in eight months, and the proving of two
new levels to 800 ft. in about the same time.
Old hands receive this forecast with obvious
They aren’t keen on believing that
the V estonia worker will shake things up
just as Robert would like. Whether the
plant will stand the strain of the programme
is also in doubt, and it isn’t certain that
water won’t wash away some of the froth
before 800 ft. is seen. As at 480 ft. the rich
shoot was only 60ft. long, the market got on
the move as soon as Stuckey wired that he
had 80ft. of good stone proved, with the
north-west drive just “it.” The danger will
come at the turn of the reef, for if the shoot
keeps a due nor’-east course the Central will
be on the look-out for it to meander across
its boundary-line. For the third time the
bears have got hot-stuff over the show. Perth
speckers being the hardest hit. Rich stone
is showing on the hanging-wall, and the word
has been passed round that the next yield
will be a startler. AH the same, with only
10,OCX) tons at 480 ft. and but 80ft. of driving
done at 560 ft., and a £lO,OOO debt to wipe
out. £120.000 is a wild price to pay on
present developmentsT-
After paying £31,814 for development and
£17,300 for taxes, Golden Horseshoe (W.A.)
last year made a profit of £54.535. of which
£75,()00 was disbursed in dividends and
£12,500 in redemption of debentures. Costs
exclusive, of development expenses were 265.
7d., or 2s. 7d. a ton more than in the pre-
vious year. The shortage of labor and the
consequent .inability of the management to
break and raise sufficient ore to keep the
mill working at its full capacity were the
co.’s chief troubles. To the end of last year
the co. had treated 3,700.000 tons of ore for
100 tons of gold, and had expended £634,000
on development and nearly as much on
machinery and plant. Its working expenses
totalled over jive millions and dividends
over three millions. Ore reserves were esti-
mated at 709,819 tons, or some 5000 tons in
excess of the figures of 12 months ago. of
an average value of 94dwt.
All is not right with Riverina South
(W.A.). Recently a new manager was
appointed, and on arrival he found on his
staff a supervising plant engineer at £l5 a
week, a working engineer, an underground
manager and a metallurgist at £7 each, and
several other £4 to £5 a week men walking
about with their coats on. As his instruc-
tions were to keep down expenses, he
promptly dropped the supervising engineer
and the underground manager. All mining and
plant construction operations were stopped
and the storekeeper given a holiday until
further stores are required to be given out.
Then, with a feeling of work well performed,
he wired the Board that satisfactory pro-
gress was being made. The metallurgist still
remains, although there are no assays at pre-
sent to be done, and the accountant and one
or two others are being kept on just for
appearance’s sake. What is really wanted
is a new Board with some idea of mine con-
trol. Already thousands of pounds have
been wasted.
The long run of ore now being proved in
the Macgregor at the 320 ft. level is another
bit of luck for Hampden Cloncurry (Q.),
which paid a heap of money for the mine
and its tram. The south drive at the
320 ft. level is facing a kindly kaolin forma-
tion with a 42in. of ore worth 14| p.c.
copper. The level is within the secondary
zone and consequently patchy. It may turn
out that the Macgregor has the length, while
the Duchess has the depth, with compara-
tively short ore shoots.
Clark’s, Charters Towers, is crushing
400 tons, and the clean-up of 180 tons for
5500 z. was so good that the Board rushed
out a threepenny on the 90,000 shares. This
is the third dividend; and, besides, the
directors have brought the claim through a
three-year course of development. In 1916
1899 tons were crushed for £15,558; in 1915.
1241 tons for £12.509. The average during
the three years has been between £9 and
£lO. From the size and lateral extent of
the narrow streak it can hardly be expected
that Clark’s will pull the Towers out of the
slough ; still the fact that such a rich little
mine has been neglected so long is an object-
lesson in itself. Charters Towprs was never
a pessimist, and its history is crowded with
surprising discoveries of rich stone. For in-
stance, the famous Brilliant reef was un-
expectedly discovered at 700 ft. below the
surface.
Chairman Niall, of Mount Morgan, gave
shareholders at Rockhampton some interest-
ing figures. In 10 years to May 31, 1916.
the old mine had produced £10,141,365, and
paid £2,037.500 in divs., £4,015.741 for wages
and labor contracts, £1,015,4 1 6 to Govern-
ment and local authorities, and £1,464,348
for stores aud machinery. The employees
have received between 40 p.c. and 50 p.c. of
the revenue and shareholders 20 p.c. Divi-
dends are also at the rate of 20 p.c. on capi-
tal, but chairman Niall frankly admits that
they must now be considered, in part, as
return of capital. In 36 years shareholders
have had £9,033,000.

HOW THIN PEOPLE MAY PUT ON
FLESH.
GREAT DISCOVERY BY EMINENT
SPECIALIST.
Judging from the countless preparations
and treatments which are continually being
advertised for the purpose of making thin
people fleshy, developing the arms, neck and
bust, and replacing ugly hollows and angles
by the soft curved lines of health and beauty,
there are evidently thousands of men and
women who keenly feel their excessive thin-
ness, and it therefore gives us real pleasure
to publish herewith a simple prescription
which, by correcting faulty metabolism and
stimulating the activity of certain sluggish
vital organs quickly produces a marked
transformation in the appearance; the in-
crease in weight frequently averaging from
three to four pounds the first week, and very
rarely less than two. This increase in weight
also carries with it a general improvement
m the health. Nervousness, sleeplessness
and debility, which nearly always accompany
excessive thinness, all quickly disappear, dull
eyes become bright, and pale cheeks glow
with the bloom of perfect health.
The prescription, which is absolutely
harmless, directs you to take before each
meal a 5-grain tablet of Bitro-phosphate,
such as you may obtain from any chemist,
at a cost of about 2d. a day. Eat all you
wa Et. but chew your food thoroughly.
CAUTlON.■—Although the above prescrip-
tion is unequalled for relieving nervousness,
sleeplessness and general debility, it should
not, owing to its recognised, flcsh-groicinfi
properties, be used by anyone who does not
desire to put on flesh. —Advt.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
DAVID
JONES
for
SMART
MILLINERY
Sydney, August 6, 1917.
My Dear Arini, —
All the Highflier dressmakers and the
Very Best shops are unloading their spring
goods. A first glance at the tiptop evening
frocks (though there really isn’t any top
worth mentioning) gives the idea of a-lady
going about in a skirt and a tiara. But
there’s more than that on close inspection.
The corsage is a gossamer drapery of tulle or
morning dew, with a few velvet straps to
prevent disaster. Sleeves are mere cobwebs,
and the effort of getting into these frail and
fascinating gowns will be counted amongst
the sorrows of the weeping duchesses. For
they fasten in hooked' entanglements at the
hack, and then cross over to more tribulation
pnder one arm.
Poqkets are frankly outside and nearer the
front. They are smaller than carryalls, but
capable of holding all the necessaries of a
knitting competition.
Opera came to an end with “Rigoletto,” a
full house and a cartload of blooms for the
Gonsalez eo. The farewell had a strong
Italian flavor, and dark-eyed signors and sig-
noras sent steady reinforcements of sweets
and flowers to their compatriots. Conductor
Gonsalez, who made an effort to thank the
audience—by proxy—got what looked like a
case of silver. But it may have been iced
asparagus. He can claim to be the most
placid foreigner who has. within recent
memory, steered an uncertain orchestra
through the twists and twirls of grand opera.
He has taken the thick with the thin, and
together they have made a musical switch-
back. Rocky going sometimes, but the con-
ductor’s smile never came off.
Wattle Day sent the Leaguers flying
through city and suburbs to give away the
golden fluff. Mrs. Birrell Robertson attended
to the Soldiers’ Club, and, military regula-
tions being suspended for the day, Billjim
walked about with a yellow crest. The loan
of a car gave the leaguers a chance to leave
a trail of bush splendor in back lanes and
mean streets. Mrs. Froggatt—hubby knows
the domestic habits of the winged creatures
of the bush —rushed round the hospitals, and
Dr. Mary Booth, with arms full of the
fluffy glory, served her pet hobby, the
soldiers’ wives centres. Ada Reeve was to
have joined-in in the morning. But she was
busy in the Equity Court about her own
golden affairs.
Many a heart under a khaki jacket will
be heavy when its owner hears that Ger-
trude Robson died in Papua the other day :
for scores of her boys are now keeping
Australia’s end up across the water. Her
brother, Ernest I. Robson, was the first
headmaster of North Shore Grammar
nearly 30 years ago, and as he was a
bachelor in those days she kept house for
him and was the “school mother,” smoothing
the way for lonely kiddies on the bumpy
paths of boarding-school life. Later, on her
brother’s marriage, she opened a preparatory
boarding- and day-school for small boys, first
at Brooksby in Double Bay. and afterwards
at Darlinghurst in the building now known
as Rose Hall, where ministering angels of
the Red Cross hover round wounded Billjim.
Gilbert White got her to take on a mission
school for variegated youngsters at Thursday
Island when he wore Anglican gaiters in
those parts ; and from there she went across
to Papua, where for some years she has
been working in the Anglican mission. At
one time she had charge of the women’s de-
partment of the Anglican Church Stan-
dard, in Sydney; and from Papua she regu-
larly sent brightly-written sketches of
tropical life and brown sister’s ways to mis-
sionary papers in the homeland —our home-
land and hers, Australia.
There won’t be many local tears at Cap-
tain Morgan’s refusal of a new term at
Jervis Bay Naval College. Indifferent health
is the stiff sailor’s explanation for refusing
further command over our young salts. One
of the departing martinet’s objections to the
Bay is “an absence of the amenities of life”
■ —which will make a chuckle go round the
press representatives who had a taste of the
bleak hospitality of the Jervis Bay College
last year.
The N. S. Wales Red Cross had its
annual wash-up in the Town flail. Deputy-
Gov. Cullen gave it his blessing. Acting-
Premier Fuller, with the dull rumble of a
strike humming' in his ears, stuck manfully
to a cheery report and balance-sheet, and
ruefully wished the Government could emu-
late the society’s thrifty methods. In pass-
ing hf> placed a sprig of rosemary on that
record of three millions given by the
Ma State’s public to patriotic funds in
the three years of war. Dick Teece moved a
vote of thanks to the chairman, and, treating
the Red Cross as a lady, handed it the best
chair.
A grand-daughter of old Parson Marsden,
of the broad-arrow days, has just passed
over at Burwood. She was Emily Mary,
widow of Julius Shelley, of Bowral. Parson
Sam arrived in Sydney in 1794, and the
original Shelley was one of the missionaries
who went to Tahiti in 1796 and were after-
wards expelled by the natives. There is
still cloth in the family; Archdeacon Oakes,
of Bathurst, is a great-grandson.
Walter Watt, who is going to take a
young wife, Eileen O’Brien (as I told you
last week), will ask her to share nearly a
million sterling—if his youthful relatives
know uncle’s position. Mrs. Sydney Clar-
ence, a cousin of the bride-to-be, is said to
have introduced the love-birds. She’s the
pretty lady whose husband is a managing-
director of Gilchrist, Watt and Co.
From an admiring Billjim in France: —
These indomitable Frenchwomen! The brave old
lady who sold us wine at Fleurbaix and gave us
many a “bakshee” coffee-and-rum, had her poor
head smashed one morning by a stray splinter while
giving hot coffee to Tommies on stretchers in her
farmyard—just then a casualty clearing-station.
Things got too hot; yet we had to use force to get
her daughters away to Sailly. And we heard
later that they managed to get back again the next
day, to bury their brave old mother.
Dead at Cremorne, Sarah, widow of
William Brooke, aged 86. Her husband was
founder and conductor of the Forbes Times,
and a prominent man from the early days
of that bustling Western town.
With the sale of the late Mrs. A. L.
Stephens’s property, Darling-
hurst, comes a whiff of earlier Sydney. She
was a widow of the late Professor Stephens,
an eminent naturalist who came from Eng-
land as headmaster of Sydney Grammar and
afterwards pursued beetles and otherwise
instructed the ’Varsity youths of years ago.
The gentle old lady who lived so long in the
home that recently went under the hammer
was the mother of artist Ethel Stephens.
The sea hath its perils. In the; first year
of war, Frank Neilly, of Manly, was mate
of a ship that was torpedoed in the English
Channel. He was rescued from a raft,
one of 15 out of 50 saved. Next his ship,
the Holthill, out from Nantes, France, with
a very mixed crew, struck a storm in the
Biscay Bay. The crew mutinied just then,
and a wreck was the fruit thereof. Now. in
the third year of the Big Turmoil, as a sub-
lieutenant of England’s Navy, Neilly is con-
valescing from his share in the last Channel
destroyer fight.
The Titian-haired
Eva Mylott, one of
Sydney’s leading
contraltos a few years
ago, is now Mrs.
Hutton Gibson, of
N’York. Like her
cousin, Mrs. Currie
(Marie Narelle), the
N. S. Wales woman
is built on Junoesque
lines. A few months
ago an American
critic, straying from
his task as a voice-
taster, described
Eva’s majestic ap-
pearance in irides-
cent green silk with
silver gauze shining
like sea-foam
through the classic folds. “Massive braids
of red-gold hair completed the impressive
ensemble,” said the smitten ’Murkan gentle-
man, whose fountain-pen splashed so pro-
fusely over the Australian’s mermaid fixtures
that there were only a few inkdrops left
for the vocal purpose of her appearance.
Hilda Aiken, the clever Sydney girl who
“features” accompaniments and used to play
for Eva, sends the photo I pass on to you.
She writes from N’York. Hutton Gibson is

The Cullen dame removes the imaginary
veil that keeps a village-fair closed till it has
been spoken to from a platform. It occurs
on August 9 in St. James’s Hall, and is to
help the Comforts Fund of the Ist and 53rd
Battalions. Mrs. Glanville has been shep-
hording the flock.
The Y.M.C.A., through a citizens’ corn-
mittee, asked N. S. Wales for £50,000 to
help its work at the Front. The treasurers
mention that they have so far got £l6l*ooo,
and money is still dribbling into 14 Moore-
street and getting as warm a welcome as
ever.
The Cherniavsky trio had a big audience
to demand the usual toll of encores on
Saturday night. Possibly they’ve now left
Sydney for the very last time before going
to ’Murka, though the public is wary of
farewell concerts. Leo the tiddler and
Mischel the ’cellist put more body into their
final performances. The ethereal Jan, who
looks like floating skywards on a cloud of
Chopin, provided the accompaniment while
Max Selinsky and brother Leo fiddled.
“France’s Day’’ won’t stop. The Conser-
vatorium orchestra is now fiddling its hard-
est to work up for an afternoon concert to
help. Town Ilall, August 11. Verbrugghen
in command.
Here is one of
our younger Aus-
tralian artists, Mary
M. EdAvards, whose
studio perches at 26
Jamieson-street. In
her teens she Avas.a
pupil of the Tech.
Art classes in dusty
Ultimo, and left fel-
low-students, Avide-
eyed, behind. Her
precocious ability,
after some later
tou c h i 11 g- u p by
Julian Ashton,
strayed to Paris.
This Avas just before
the war.' Fifteen
months' Avork. too
short for Mary’s
aspirations, and ill-health due to the cold of an
Arctic winter brought her back to sunshine.
She likes warm crimson and the ardent tints
of iris purple; and this color-sense pervades
her portrait studies. The gift of catching
a likeness peeps out of her miniatures, some
of them no larger than a two-shilling piece.
She got into the Paris Salon through the
graceful pose of a woman’s head —a study .of
mature excellence. On Aug. 14 and 15
Mary holds a one-girl art show in the airy
premises in Jamieson-street.
Mrs. Pickburn, widow of the young Judge
who died a few weeks ago, has been appointed
Associate to Judge Rolin, an intimate friend
of the dead lawyer. So far as this State is
concerned it is a new departure. But at
least two Judges of the High Court —Isaacs
and Duffy—have daughters waiting upon Pa
and making witnesses swear not to pull his
leg.
Ada Reeve challenged N. S. Wales to
raise £5OOO for that little bit of Australia in
London, the Anzae Buffet, while France’s
Day was treading on the gilded heels of
Triangle Day. And she’s going to get it.
If not this week, it will be waiting for her
-—barely a thou, is wanted to make up the
total —when she comes back to Sydney for
Christmas. The Tivoli matinee brought in
over £7OO during the week. At the auction
the goods varied from an indignant parrot to
bald kewpies, prize pups with pedigrees ’way
back to the original dog, and wax dolls. Ada
was the best auctioneer of the lot, leaving
a mere professional like W. A. Little gasp-
ing at her daring. Mrs. Harry Rickards was
a generous bidder. More cautious, in an
opposite pen, was the Pudukota lady, who
eventually secured a pot of jam (perhaps it
was blackberry) for £2 10s. This little
tribute was made by a soldier’s mother —-
and brought altogether nearly £2O. Dorothy
Brunton and Marie Tempest assisted—-
Marie chiefly as a bidder. She looked her
best in a fascinating velvet frock and amaz-
ing millinery. I think it was a pale buff
orpington sitting on a nest with its .wings
pointing to Heaven.
Chatting of boots —an ever-lengthening
problem—noticed the Marie Tempest foot-
gear? It always tones with her dress, but
there’s more to it than that. She wears the
pull-overs that neither lace nor button —just
come over her toes and ankles (the latter
exceedingly neat) like a man’s top-boots.
Soft as a kid glove, they don’t show any
wrinkles worth mentioning. It seems an
easy and comfortable fashion. But, Heavens,
the price !
A chilly wind sweeps over the Engineers’
sand dunes beyond Moore Park almost any
afternoon. But visitors, after paying six-
pence apiece to inspect, are warmed up by
an exhibition of bomb-throwing. The
trenches with well-bagged walls, the engi-
neers’ bridge on boats, and casks and other
mimic details of the real thing, amuse the
youngsters. Pozieres is the name of a tea
stall—Mrs. Vandervelde in charge the day
I was there : —made as like the rough-and-
ready refreshment booths near the firing-line
as our peaceful circumstances permit. The
proceeds of this display—open all the week
—go to buy Tommy Cookers.
Though still seriously ill and in a Ivillara
private hospital. Mrs. Bertram Stevens is
struggling back round the “Danger” corner

who used to hit the golf-balls in pre-war
H. K. P. Tiddy, accidentally killed the
other day, was one of the first batch of p ii ots
to get their certificates from our very own
aviation school at Richmond. Sent to Eng-
land, he got a commission almost at once as
flight-lieutenant; but Kismet cut him off
before he could reach the Front. Tiddy was
a B.Sc, of Sydney Uni., and was teaching
mathematics at the High School in Orange
when he enlisted.
A very quiet patriot got an unexpected
recognition the other day. when Consul
Chayet, on behalf of the French, made a
little presentation to Mrs. Arthur Jewett.
One of the hard-worked joint lion. secs, of
the French League since its start, she has
hitherto got behind the door when bouquets
were handed round.
On Friday evening at the Criterion the
fan given by Marie Tempest to the Blinded
Soldiers’ Fund is to be put up for auction.
As I mentioned the otffer week, it’s an ex-
quisite little affair of ivory sticks inlaid
with gold and painted in the sumptuous
Louis XIV. manner.
Notice that Prof. Wood has been handing
a posy to the tireless delver in old Spanish
story, George Collingridge? It was at a
recent Historical Society’s meeting p >u \
the fact remains that all the brooms the
Society owns won’t sweep away all the
cobwebs that time has spun over the story
of the ancient Spanish main.
When soft-voiced Dr. Gertrude Halley was
here a few years ago she. was chiefly con-
cerned about the ears and teeth of State
school youngsters. Since then she has taken
root in Adelaide, and was one of a new big
batch of women J’s.P. gazetted the other day.
Quiet old Parramatta still ambles, along
after croquet balls. It recently handed the
championship of its lawns to Mrs. John
Waugh’s daughter Silva, who has a habit of
winning it. But, besides, she's a lady chef
at the Mill (Moss Vale), where Matron
Matthews rules.
The Society 7 of Women Painters had its
annual meeting last week. Object, the elec-
tion of ; ,council members. Both Mrs. F. Par-
sons and Mrs. Hedley Parsons (unrelated)
are back in their old hon. billets as officials ;
so is Miss Booth, hon. treas. The Women
Daubers’ decision to include china-painting
in their exhibition w r ill give an arts and
crafts side-Jine to future efforts. The weak-
ness of the society has been its too-indulgent
inclusion of crude samples of work by
amateurs who need the attentions of a draw-
ing-master.
■ Charles Maelurcan, a son of the cookery
chieftainess of the Wentworth Hotel, was
quietly wed the other evening to a Home-
bush girl—Winifred Kenna.
While all and sundry were bravely ex-
pressing their unshaken resolve to' see the
war to a successful finish—this cm August 4,
after three years of it —the parade of troops
had to be abandoned. Why? No trains were
available owing to the strike.
The 2nd D.A.C. and 22nd Howitzer dames,
clutching time by the forelock, have 1600
Christmas boxes all hooped and cased and
waiting for transport. To feed this early-
bird effort they caught the wriggling worm
at a crowded gift afternoon in one of Sar-
gents’ rooms, lent for the looting.
The Kindergarten Union subtly seized
Wattle Day to make its annual appeal for
the kiddies. Itowe-street was hung with its
banner, and a stall caught the thruppences
of the passer-by. Tea —for the cause—
flowed in adjacent premises, and violets and
wattle were sold in twin bunches here and
at half a dozen other gay stands.
Yours affectionately,
VANDOHIAN.

BEFORE I purchased T looked
at many types of disc playing
instruments. Fine though
some of them were, the differ-
ences seemed trifling. All* looked
alike. One may have given a little
better results in instrumental music,
and another with the human voice.
And then my quest led me to the
XEW IX ST.RUM EXT, the Aeolian-
Voealion, and all others faded from
mind.
Tn tlie Vocalion T heard music
1 never dreamed a Phonograph
.could produce. Sweet, full rich-
ness of tone vibrant with the
very quality of life, delicate
tonal tints marked the differ-
ence of instrument and instru-
ment. Here was the model to
satisfy my desires, its appeal
was irresistible. I was charmed
with the “GRADUOLA” ex-
pression device; by gentle pres-
sure the music seemed to melt
to my touch, swelling forth to
a full flood of melody at will;
what joy at expressing my own
feeling, and then at the end
of the selection all was silent;
it had automatically stopped.

An Actual Photograph.
SMASHING AMONGST OUR ANZACS
found other than a human mark in a great battle
on the Western Front.
Mr A. J. Cousins, of the A.1.F., was struck by a
shrapnel bullet, but the steel lining of his pocket
wallet, here illustrated, saved his life.
The force of the impact may be judged by a careful
study of the photograph, of the razor-like cut
through the solid leather, and the deep indentations
of the steel lining and the identification disc.
The wallet contains two solid leather pouches, note-
paper and pencil, is steel-lined throughout, bound
in heavy leather and makes an excellent gift for
your soldier.

My Dear Yarrie.—
Can’t our .Win-the-War economists do
without the red carpet folly until times are
better? The G.-G. and party returned from
a private visit to some Ballarat friends at
the end of the week and the fussy souls
at Spencer-street station ordered a red carpet
to be laid across the platform to the vice-
regal motor-car. However, when the train
steamed in the engine-driver made a bad
guess, and the special carriage failed to stop
exactly opposite the streak. The G.-G.
would have had to leap 10 feet to land on
it, so he just marched across the uncarpeted
asphalt to his car, and was none the worse
for it. A Bungaree potato-grower coming
to town for a joyous week-end wiped his
boots on the superfluous praying mat.
The Stanley dame is just beginning to
emerge out of the reinforced nursery. She
made a first appearance for the Military
Nurses’ Club at the Grand Hotel.
The hockey club which has Lady Doris
Blackwood as a member practises every
Saturday on the lawn before .Federal Govern-
ment House. The membership at first rushed
up to extravagant numbers;- but the less
energetic damsels dropped out with muttered
apologies after a few games. Two or three
weeks ago the casualties of one Saturday
were serious, but the patients are gradually
mending. Olive Bridges was motored home
nursing an injured ankle, and young Peter-
son whacked flying-man Galloway over the
jaw with such effect that he was carried off
to the Base Hospital for repairs.
Beside itself, Wesley College simply roared
the College football song one recent morning
in honor of Captain Robert Cuthbert Grieve,
the first Great Public boy to win the Vic-
toria Cross. As a youngster he was umpir-
ing a football match, Wesley v. Oakleigh,
arrayed in dinner-dress because he would not
have time to change for a feast to which he
was bidden that evening. Wesley was four
men short, and losing, so at half-time he
pulled on a jersey, tucked the legs of his
pants into his socks, resigned the post of
umpire and helped to win the game. When
the Hun made his rush for goal and hit the
post at the Marne, Bob broke in as 2nd
lieutenant in a Vic. battalion. He was soon
a captain, and a fellow officer describes his
individual deeds as “simply glorious” and his
leadership as “magnificent.” He won the
Cross by bombing the crews of two Hun
machine-guns, reorganising his company and
attacking. He was shot in the shoulder, and
the German who did it was blown out by
Bob’s batman, who used Bob’s revolver to dc
it with. Grieve is recovering in hospital.
His mother is a Brighton widow. Father
was one of the founders of the Lane firm of
Connibere, Grieve and Connibere, softgoods.
So/t-goods! Robert?
The widow Ross Soden’s three soldier sons
managed to meet in England before the last
mail left. The airman was already there —
invalided —when son Harry arrived with the
troops from the torpedoed Ballarat. Gordon,
with the Artillery in France, squeezed out a
few days’ leave, and the re-union was man-
aged.
Hilary Carlisle, the medical son of Ed-
ward Carlisle and his dame (his only bro-
ther recently fell in the trenches), has sent
word that he has risen to the rank of major.
Hilary’s pretty fiancee, the second Miss
Weigall, is smiling happily.
A fresh batch of nurses has been called
up from the eager waiting list. The ladies
are hustling into uniform in a breathless
way, and guess they must be going to the
tropics because of the lightness of their kit.
The Claude Hamiltons and daughter
Shiela lately came down from Macedon to
meet’ brother Colonel Fred Bird, who opens
fire properly when it comes to the question
of men being wanted on the other side.
Win? “Why,” he says, “we haven't started
to win yet!”
The mossy old walls of the Mint are to
echo with melody and teacup clatter on the
18th, when Mrs. Mathew Bagge, whose Mr.
is Deputy-Master of the factory, is to
have a bazaar for the L.M.P. League, while
daughter Marjorie will give a concert in the
quad, with the help of pals. Marjorie used
to study singing and the fiddle at the Uni.
Conservatorium during the directorship of
Franklin Potorson.
Some business-like people take their
religion as a sort of fire-insurance and cease
to pay premiums as soon as they think all
is safe. The wife of a gilded officer turned up
regularly at the tabernacle every Sunday
after she had got w r ord by cable that her
husband had started for the trenches. As
she wasn’t a churchgoer at ordinary times,
people noticed it. When she got word that
Iter husband had left for Australia she
promptly cut out church again, and the
watching congregation cackled louder than
ever. There never yet .was a congregation
so buried in its prayers that it hadn’t time
to keep the eagle eye on interesting strangers.
The Falkiners are marching on and pos-
sessing the earth. Their latest acquisition is
Puckawidgee station and all the stock that
graze on its 90.000 sheepish Riverina acres.
Marjorie Eadie, daughter of the Bendigo
medico, could not get to the other side to
attend a wedding appointment she had with
Lieut. Soss Wertheim, so she is talking at
recruiting meetings and helping thus to fin-
ish the beastly war.
A long-sighted bride-elect who recently
started for Colombo included in her trous-
seau several pairs of gaudy pyjamas all
huge black-and-white stripes. She was not
following futurist fashions, but the quaint
theory that sharks have a dislike for stripes,
particularly the black-and-white species.
Mrs. Marmion and daughter Daphne were
amongst the she-sailors who lately ventured
to America. They had been wintering in
Melbourne ever since the Westralian authori-
ties refused passports for a projected English
trip.
When invited to London put your money
in your boots. Certain coroneted dames
there lately arranged a war bazaar and
invited some of the moneyed Australians to
help with an Anglo-Australian stall. The
gratified w r ool wives and daughters sent the
hat round and forwarded piles of oddments
and needlework fit for a Bond-street window
display. But when the donors dashed in
to arrange their stand they found only empty
cases, the British peeresses having seized the
whole consignment to deck their own bazaar
counters. Nobody laughed but a few jealous
Anglo-Australian cats who had not been
asked to help. Some day an English duchess
will be caught stealing washing off a line in
Houndsditch. and the trembling House of
Lords will have to try her.
Miss Adelaide’s letter :
The Babies’ Hospital moved from its old quarters
in St. Peter’s to the new address, Mareeba, on
Wednesday, and was hindered in the process by
drenching rain and the bitterest cold of the winter.
However, under motor cover, 15 babies, in age any-
thing from a few weeks to a year, and all of them
ill, were safely transported from the eastern to the
western suburbs.
The League of Loyal Women attended its second
annual meeting on Tuesday—that is, some of it did,
for it has a membership of 7000. Its record of perform-
ance is a credit. The Trench Comforts work is run by
one of its committees, the Edith Cavell Fund is under
its auspices. It started the battalion clubs, and it is
responsible for the scheme whereby “service bars”
are issued to the feminine next-of-kin of men at
the Front. Over 8000 of these bars have been
served out.
A Military Medal has come to Private Keith
Hocking, who for the past two and a half years has
been interviewing the enemy in Egypt and France.
He is a son of M. C. Hocking, one of our best-known
journalists.
Our patriotic fund contributions to June 30 total
£846,593. Next to the South Aus. Soldiers’ Fund,
which has received £425,000, is the Belgian Relief
Fund with £134,000, or £56,000 more than has
gone to the Red Cross. One of the most creditable
items on the balance-sheet is £5500 raised by the
Children’s Patriotic Fund.
The Commonwealth Club, which, for want of pre-
mises of its own, cavorts at the Town Hall, lunched
Cyril Maude on Tuesday. One of the lunchers was
Dr. Melville Jay, who was a fellow passenger of
Maude when that young-old man sailed to Australia
umpty years ago.
The Mooltan’s passengers included about two
dozen nurses from this State, among them a sister
of W. J. P. Giddings, who directs the destinies of
the Veterans’ Corps, and Miss Linklater, a cousin of
Isbister, Iv.C. Which reminds me that S. Aus.
soldiers and sailors are preparing a roll of honor to
our nurses. It is to be unveiled at the Town Hall
by Lady Helen Munro Ferguson in September.
Lieut. Garland, who got his D.C.M. at Pozieres,
is to be welcomed home at Port Adelaide on Mon-
day. He was on the writing staff of the Register
before he enlisted.
Miss Edith Adie, an English water-colorist who
has been staying here for some weeks, is to exhibit
a selection of her art towards the middle of the
month. Garden sketches are her specialty. She
“did” the Westralian Government House cabbage-
patch while she was staying with the Barrons. Lady
Galway has promised to open the exhibition, which
will be in the Society of Arts rooms.
Averre Marie Miller, daughter of Lieut.
Miller, has promised to become Mrs. George
Mawdsley in the near future. George is a
son of the Williamstown Mawdsleys.
Guido Barrachi, who touched off the Uni-
versity Magazine, is booked for matrimony
at the end of the year. The lady is Miss
Tobin, and she possesses both beauty and
brains. He has the money.
Bettine Cavendish’s plain war-time wed-
ding with Naval-Lieut. Wellwood Maxwell
excited all the wealthy Australian absentees
in London. There were no bridesmaids or
guests beyond the family circle, and the
social horrors of war were emphasised in
the cake, whose nakedness was concealed
wfith white paper and silver leaves, sugar-
icing being an offence against the law. The
bride when a small child visited Australia
under the wing of her mother, once
a Toorak belle, whose wedding with
tall Guardsman William Cavendish, brother
of the Chesham baron, was a social event of
the ’SO’s. Bride Bettine’s hubby belongs to
the Landale clan.
The Stork flew over Hal Gye’s residence
the other day and bombed the abashed youth
with a dumpling which is alleged to be
awfully like its father. It is noted as a sig-
nificant fact that the new arrival will only
be quiet when it is given a pencil to play
with.
“The Kennedy boys,” who are appearing
with tenor Balboni at the Auditorium next
week, comprise three spare Australians, Keith,
Lance and Laurie, whose frames seem hardly
large enough to hold their musical education.
Keith, the violinist, was pouring classical
strains into the uninstructed ears of Mel-
bourne Tivoli audiences some time back,
■whilst Lance, the flautist, and Laurie, who
has made a Siamese twin of his ’cello, were
lately giving of their best in the Gonsalez
opera orchestra. The lads (the eldest not
30 yet) are being piloted by dad, the optimist
who once tried to dislodge David Storey
from his Randwick seat in the N. S. Wales
Assembly, and polled nearly 70 votes.
The Stanleys are blessing the Lois concert
at the Auditorium on August 15.
A number of Melbourne fellows connected
with the arts, defiances and skiterature were
invited to feed last week in compliment to
the author of “The Straits Impregnable” and
John “McNorth” McLaren, an old Scotch
College boy who left Melbourne 14 years
ago, and a while later went to the northern
extremity of Cape York to do freelance
press-w T ork and grow cocoanuts. How Mac.
ever came to consent to that “little dinner”
proposal is the question that puzzles his
warmest sympathisers. Probably he thought
he was being invited to eat with a tribe of
friendly blacks. Or it may be that a recent
visit to Sydney corrupted him.
The husband of the Russian “lecturess”
Grebin has drifted away to America. He
claims to be a political refugee and is
anxious to get back to his boiling country,
but by what route is not explained. Grebin,
who was lately elected head of the Russian
colony here, has doubtless left his clever
wife to reign in his stead. They raised
over £7O at the I’ecent concert for establish-
ing a library for the local Russians.
The committee of the Children’s Welfare
Association trooped up the Herald steps the
other day, carrying a huge leather bag, which
they insisted upon presenting to Maisie
Maxwell, who, they say, has done much to
help them.
Louis Esspn and his wife (once Dr. Hilda
Bull) are doing nicely in New York. Louis
has found quite a lot of intellects to appre-
ciate his plays and several editors who long
to publish his stories. Also an actor-manager
wants Mrs. Louis to act in special parts.
When Jo. Smith, whose “Before the
Dawn” proved such a gold-mine for the war-
funds, was filling the cast of his new produc-
tion, “The Reveille,” which is to aid the
Mayoress’s Patriotic League Fund, he
selected Sergeant Dick Harwood, pf the Am-
bulance Corps, for the part of Sergeant
Ilewison, A.I.F. But Harwood fell ill, and
Jo cast about for a .substitute. A woman
member of the co. (all amateurs) suggested
a young relative who, as a returned soldier
with a uniform and a gift for recitation,
might fill the part. Jo put him through his
paces, and was satisfied. The new man was
Corporal Alf Wilson. In his part as Ser-
geant Harwood he impersonates an Anzac
who has re-enlisted, and has to say: “Yes,
I was five months on the Peninsula, and got
outed twice.” He to Smith : “Do you mind
if I alter that ‘twice’ to ‘three times’?” “Not
at all,” said Jo. “But why?” “Because I
was!" said the dinkum soldieroo. Smith sub-
dued a thrill, and went on: “Do you think
you could sound the reveille?” “I think so,”
was the answer. “I sounded it on the South-
land !”
The Repertory Theatre Women’s Club has
sunk at its moorings, and there’s nothing
but a few floating tea-leaves to mark the
spot. The only survivors are the sewers
(that looks horrible, doesn’t it?), who still
collect for their work at set times. Art
cannot live by tea alone.
A party of enthusiastic feminines who
call themselves the National Service Girls
intend to help the State War Council finan-
cially by producing “The Rivals,” at the
Playhouse, with not a man to help. Dates
and particulars are promised later.
It's the fashion for star mummers to gi Vt i
an extra turn after the curtain has fallen on
the play. Cyril Maude started it, and since
then other principals have followed suit
Well, there’s nothing to be said against these
lOmin. curtain-lectures provided the yarns
introduced are new and well told. All the
same, if the programme has to be strung out
a good many of us would prefer to see a
one-act piece instead of quasi-vaudeville per-
formances. When one considers the high
quality of the one-acteu produced over-seas
during the last decade or so, one can only
deplore, once again, the lack of enterprise
exhibited by Australian theatrical firms.
Margaret Sutcliffe, who has arrived in
Melbourne to play lead in the Bert Bailey
Shakspearean productions, is a clever Aus-
tralian who has put a long list of English
successes to her credit since she left Mel-
bourne. She is a sister of the' Rev. T.
Beiirle, of Camberwell, and the wife of
Major Sutcliffe, an invalided officer, who
saw service in Africa and has been doing
his extra bit training others for the fight in
which he cannot take an active part. Perhaps
you don’t remember that she recited at Amy
Castles’s farewell concert in Melbourne Town
Hall years ago. Later she went to London
herself and studied for 12 months at two of
the London University Colleges—the South'
Kensington and King’s. Strand. Then she
went to the Guildhall Music Theatre, where
Miss Kate Parker has her theatrical school,
and there landed four of the best certificates
that London can produce, as well as the
gold medal from the London Academy of
Music for Shakspearean work. After all
that preparation she ventured on the stage
and made good. She is a handsome girl with
remarkable black eyes and an exquisite pro-
file, and is hoping to make her fellow-Aus-:
tralians sit up when she plays Cleopatra.
lan MacLaren, who produced Shakspeare
for Margaret Anglin in America, will have
full charge of the Bert Bailey productions,
lie has cables cheering him on from Mar-
garet Anglin, Lillah McCarthy and Gran-
ville Barker, and a letter from Winthrop
Ames, head of the Little Theatre in London.
MacLaren appeared in Barker’s Greek
tragedies at the Little Theatre, and was
Samson when Coyle produced the tremen-
dous “Samson Agonistes” at the Royal
Academy, Burlington House.
The Cheer-O’s —a company of clever Bendigo
girls—are coming to town on August 28, to
sing and play to the invalided soldiers at
the Caulfield Military Hospital. Marjorie
Eadie is leader, and she has coached her
team in a programme calculated to banish
pain for an hour or two.
Melbourne’s new plain-clothes police-
women are now at work, each carrying a
police-badge and detective’s warrant as the
tools of her trade. A worthy task for the
Bobberina will be to see that the children
of dissolute mothers receive proper attention.
There are many other activities for them,
but they will easily earn their wages on
child-salving duty alone.
'lf you should want to put fresh fastenings
on your husband’s old pyjamas, you will dis-
cover that “pearl” buttons of the most ordi-
nary kind are now sixpence each in Mel-
bourne shops. Yet this benighted country
has pearl-shell by the ton available for the
picking up. The best way out is to sew the
sixpences on the pyjamas instead of exchang-
ing them for buttons. You can’t cash a pearl
button in even the wildest emergency.
Ballrooms are out of fashion; but one
over-plump dame puts hers to good use by
rolling the length of the apartment 12 times
every morping as a cure for stoutness. The
other week-end she invited some women-
friends to try the recipe with her. It made
the very newest in parties.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA..

Do You Suffer from Headaches, Backache,
Dizziness, Lassitude, Poorness of Blood ?
A QUALIFIED CHEMIST’S ADVICE.
Overstudy at school, overwork after leaving school, the stress of enervating
climatic conditions, worry, and defective digestion sooner or later lead to a depletion of
the nerve forces, thereby causing headaches, backache, dizziness, lassitude, sleepless-
ness. nervous dyspepsia, poorness of blood, and a hundred and one other ailments to
which human flesh is heir. Many people (though acting with the very best of inten-
tions) actually aggravate these conditions by flying to stimulants to brace themselves
up, or to narcotics to ease down the pain. If you had a horse, low in condition, you

“Renault”: “Trooper Bluegum” says the
Camel Corps wants a prescription to cure jibbers.
I’m the doqtor. While with an exploration party
in Central Australia we generally had trouble when
the team had been ten or more days under broiling
sun without a drink. We at first tried gentle per-
suasion, but later resorted to several crude methods
including the firestick and the, ear water. All only
seemed to make the brutes ignore us more, if pos-
sible, than ever. One day, however, to our joy, the
camel’s pet aversion was discovered. A jibbing
devil settled by mistake upon an ant-bed, and we
noted with interest the speed with which he arose
and careered to the extremity of his nose-line. There
is no scarcity of ants, of some description, anywhere
that I know of, so, for us, the rest was easy. All
we had to do was to gather up a score or two in
some convenient receptacle and shake them upon the
head and legs of the culprit, who would promptly
do the rest.
“The Arcadian”: This is the story of a
wonderful egg. Three ducks were kept in a pen in
the yard of a workingman’s home at East Brunswick
(Vic.). Two were setting. The third was disconso-
late. It made a place for itself in a corner of the
pen, and tried to perform the natural function of a
bird of its traditions. At nightfall the careful house-
holder fastened the pen, which was covered in on all
sides. Next day when Mrs. E. Brunswick opened the
enclosure an egg was there. It was a heavy egg, but
she did not discover its full weight until she attempted
to crack the shell on the edge of a basin. It broke the
basin. She consulted the local grocer. He wouldn’t be-
lieve it was an ordinary egg but for the faith he had in
the sobriety of his poor but honest customer. His
scales showed that the duck-blossom weighed 7oz.
The lady was sure that the layer had never been out
of the pen, and that no strange animal of the neo-
lithic age had broken into the enclosure. The story
THU FORETHOUGHT OF GEORGE.
“Isn't it fortunate you, brought your um-
brella, George—otherwise we might have
got wet?”
got round. A poultry expert belonging to a Mel-
bourne newspaper viewed the exhibit and promptly
decided that it was not an egg but a piece of marble.
This made the grocer hilarious and disgusted the
duck-herd. Someone suggested that a joke had been
played on the duck, but the owner thereof is pre-
pared to swear that nobody has access to the pen
but herself and her family, and that marble eggs are
not among the family heirlooms. Has any Abo. con-
tributor heard of a similar occurrence? I believe that
in one of the scientific institutions in Melbourne
there is a round ball as hard as stone taken from the
recesses of a woman, which was formed by some pro-
cess of nature as the result of the said woman’s
thoughtless habit of chewing her hair when holding
the ends in her mouth in the bedtime business of
plaiting. Perhaps the other duck used to plait its
feathers that way.

“Block 10”: Re “C.M.B.’s” inquiry con-
cerning the origin of manna (B. 12/7/T7). The
Australian species is caused by the large black cicada,
popularly, though incorrectly, known as the musical
locust, which pierces the young twigs of the manna
gum-trees, so causing the sweet sap to flow freely.
This sap, drying into a sugary, solid substance, later
on falls to the ground. There are several other sub-
stances known as manna. One comprises lichens of
the genus Lecanora, which grows in the deserts of
Arabia and Africa, and which is sometimes collected
and used as food. Again, in Persia and Arabia grows
a low, spiny, leguminous shrub known as camel’s
thorn, from which exudes a sweetish gum, also called
manna.
* * * *
“Barcoo”: “Merrigal’s yarn (B. 5/7/T7)
that the black swan prefers the southern latitudes
of Australia proves that he doesn’t know the North.
The huge lagoons and lakes of tropical Bananaland
are sanctuaries for all manner of wild fowl, especi-
ally swan. Two nurseries are notable—Lakes
Buchanan and Gallilee, the latter 90-odd miles
round its shores, and Gallilee’s circumference is
probably larger. When the season is propitious on
these sheets black swan may be seen in uncountable
numbers and the multitude of the feathered tribes
generally is to southerners quite unimaginable.
“E.M.W.”: Unless I’ve discovered a new
brand of black cockatoo “H.V.E.” (B. 12/7/’l7) is
wrong when he says that, while the birds usually
occur in pairs or small companies, they are some-
times seen in flocks of about 30. In the Darling
Ranges of Westralia they occur oftenest in flocks of
at least a hundred. Every evening in the summer,
just after sunset, one hears them flying towards the
seaward plains. Why they go there I don't know.
They return to the hills at about sunrise. “H.V.E.”
says, too, that the callnote of the fowl he knows is
seldom uttered. I have never known my lot to fly
without uttering it all the time.
“0.5. H.”: “Montalex” (B. 21/6/’l7) may
be an expert when it comes to snakebites, but his
chemistry is rather shaky. Potassium permanganate
is certainly a decompositive for snake venom, an
elaborate protein substance which is quite easily
oxidised and broken down by pot. permanganate and
rendered harmless. The case of an antbite, how-
ever, is altogether different. The sting is there due
to formic acid, and under circumstances existing
in the body this could not possibly be acted upon
by pot. permang. and rendered inactive. Formic
acid is extremely stable, and I think it would be
difficult to find an ordinary substance which would
decompose it, although it can be easily enough
neutralised. Still, I doubt if this would ease the
pain.
* » * *
“Bean Stalk” : I’m one of the people who
can vouch for the growth of forest trees on Fraser
Island (Q.) to a height of 40ft. in three years (B.
5/7/’l7). I saw the ground cleared ready for plant-
ing in January, 1914, and can send you a photograph
of the vegetables taken in January, 1917, by Dudley
Le Souef, director of the Melbourne Zoo, and bearing
his endorsement. Here’s some more. On the banks
of the Mary River, close to Maryborough, there are
gardens containing tall pine-trees (Norfolk Island),
bunya and kauri, running up a hundred feet and
quite big enough for sawmill logs. Forty years ago
this land was virgin soil bearing nothing but gums
and scrub. Thirty-four years ago I saw six bunya
pine seedlings planted in front of the old Royal
Hotel, Maryborough. Sixteen years later they yielded
logs 20ft. long and 18in. in diameter.
“The Old Soldier”: “Hussar’s” story of the
cavalry officer who had his face completely bitten off
by a camel is, I have no doubt, true, though it is
the first time I have heard of anyone making a pet
of an “oont,” and I have had a lot of experience of
the brutes. A grown man is rarely bitten; it is
generally a half-grown boy, given a halter to hold,
who pays the penalty of momentary inattention. I
have known the crown of such a one’s head to be
snapped off with the strong steel-trap jaws. All
camels are alike in temper, except that the females
are more devilish than the males. Even the lumber-
ing two-humped bactrian beast of Central Asia is
savage and dangerous. The old Mongol Khans and_
Atabegs used, by the way, to keep trained fighting
camels for the amusement of themselves and their
guests.
“Eryander”: I haven’t seen the Queens-
land Periophthalmus, or walk-about fish (B.
5/7/’l7), but the larger species that abounds in
Bornean mangrove flats is a quaint creature with
queer habits. Its pectoral fins are practically fore-
legs, with which it works its way along the mud, its
front-end well raised, and its big bulging eyes peri-
scoping in all directions. I have timed its absence
from the water up to 24 minutes, but about a
minute is the usual limit. It mounts the mangrove
roots in search of insects, but it remains always on
the alert, and can jerk itself back to the water in
a couple of seconds. Hundreds can be observed some-
times lying with the Water covering only the tp.il,
which, being furnished with a special oxidising
apparatus, allows breathing to be carried on.
THE POPULAR DEMAND.
SHE: “And do you sell much of your work?”
THE GIFTED JUGGINS: “W ell, ah, not exactly sell, so to speak. But I had two stolen last
week.”
“Hay”: Here’s an entry for the mixed-
team competition. At Paratoo station, north-east
South Aus., the firewood used to be hauled in to
headquarters by a team made up of' a couple of
bullocks in the pole of the dray, with half a dozen
donkeys ahead of them in pairs. Binghi with a
long bullock whip kept them "well up to the collar,
while his two Mrs. Binghis, mounted on the leaders'
postillion fashion, steered.

was faultless, and it was done without any apparent
effort. To watch him saunter into his catching pen
and grab the first sheep handy, you’d think he’d be
the drummer instead of the ringer. The following
i 3 the dinkum record of the Burenda shearing for
October 31, 1894, E. T. Brown, now of Wineheombe,
Carson, Limited, Sydney, being boss of the board.
Forty-seven men, including five learners, shore in
S| hours 7149 sheep, averaging a fraction better
than 152 per man; 5656 sheep were full-mouthed
flock owes with 73 per cent, of lambs weaned from
them off the shears; the balance of 1493 were six-
tooth flock ewes, with 60 per cent, of lambs weaned.
From the above ewes 125 bales of wool were pressed
(110 bales turned out in the day by four men with
two pressers). Weight of wool (exclusive of packs),
448 cwt. 2qr. 161 b., or a little bver 71b. per sheep.
Tallies of men over 150 : 21 5 , 208 , 205, 204, 201,
191, 189, 189, 183, 182, 176, 175, 172, 172, 170,
166, 163, 162. 160, 158, 157, 157, 153. In Burenda
the classer’s fleece-carrier had to be renewed every
fortnight owing to leg-weariness.
“Mole” : Quite recently at Brookvale, near
Manly (N.S.W.), a bird of the honev-sucker species
was discovered firmly enmeshed in a spider’s web.
Jhe exhausted captive measured about 12in. from
wing-tip to wing-tip. I have heard of smaller birds
being caught similarly (vide C. A. Musson’s account
of a silver-eye in a web at Hawkesbury College), but
never of a bird so large as a honey-sucker.

MULGA TWIGS.
[FOR THE BULLIN.]
There ain’t no golden splendor loose
Around about my old caboose;
’Tis sand an’ stones an’ mulga trees,
With no one near;
No singin’ birds nor hummin’ bees,
Nor frivolous corroborees
From year to year ;
But miles an’ miles of Mitchell grass,
An’ saltbush clumps where stockmen pass
From Elsinore;
But what, with neither lad nor lass,
Do I want more ?
My pipe an’ dog an’ saddle-horse, ;
A tranquil life to lead,
Enough to eat, an’ then, of course,
A book or two to read.
I’m on a middlin’ steady job,
A-moochin’ round the woolly mob,
An’ ridin’ over flat an’ hill,
An’ rivulet,
To see each fence is standin’ still,
An’ tanks an’ dams, which seldom fill,
Are holdin’ yet.
An’ when at times out on the plains,
I meet the gaunt grey camel trains.
Or some old tramp,
I have a yarn; an’ when it rains
I do a camp.
An’ little makes for happiness
In camp for man or dog,
If blazing therein you possess
A good old mulga log.
It’s up an’ out when night has gone,
An’ back to bunk when day is done,
An’ work an’ feed an’ smoke between,
An’ such is life.
For five-an’-twenty years I’ve been
Located midst this grey an’ green,
’Thout mate or wife.
The landscape’s mostly grey an’ sere,
An’ if the summer span’s austere,
With dust an’ flies,
Say, what’s the cry of mortals here
When summer dies ?
Some mulga twigs to light the fire,
Which makes home warm an’ grand,
An’ satisfies your heart’s desire
O’ nights in Mulgaland.
E’er circulatin’ ’mid the grim
Wide spaces of the outer rim,
A salamander I might be —
As some remark —
As dry an’ sapless as the tree
That feeds the flock an’ comforts me
When days are dark ;
But what about the roof of stars,
The balm that comes to frets an scars.
When daylight’s flown?
The freedom here that knows no bars
But Nature’s own ?
God knows it ain’t all marmalade
In seasons hereabout,
But mulga boughs will make a shade,
An’ shut the wild winds out.
Though tanned an’ toughened like the vine,
Twined where the sun knows how to shine,
Sometimes I’ve ills an’ mishaps ’ere,
Which I could spare ;
But such don’t happen ev’ry year
In this God-given atmosphere
With common care.
■Where’er I go the waterbag
Is my inseparable swag,
Till home again,
To circumvent the grinning hag
That haunts the plain.
With water, grub, an’ eonnnonsense,
Whatever times may be,
An’ mulga twigs for home defence,
That’s good enough for me.

IF STOMACH HURTS DRINK HOT
WATER.
A SPECIALIST’S ADVICE.
“If dyspeptics, sufferers from flatulence,
indigestion, acidity, gastric catarrh, etc.,
would only take a quarter teaspoonful of
biswated magnesia in half a glass of hot
water immediately after eating, they would
soon forget that they were ever afflicted with
■stomach trouble, and doctors would have to
look elsewhere for patients.” In explanation
of these words the specialist stated that most
forms of stomach trouble were due to acidity
and fermentation of the food contents com-
bined with insufficient blood supply to the
stomach. Hot water increases the blood
supply, and bisurated magnesia instantly
neutralises the acid and stops food fermen-
tation ;. the combination of the two, there-
fore, being very efficient and infinitely prefer-
able to the use of artificial digestives, stimu-
lants and medicines.— Advt.

“E.A.C.” : The edible tree-grub, introduced
by “F.E.M.” (B. 7/6/’l7), is the daintiest morsel on
the somewhat varied menu of the dinkum outbacker.
The luscious mouthfuls are plentiful in Groperland,
and practically form a marrow in the roots and
stems of the snake-wood tree, a stunted bush that
bedecks the auriferous belts of the Golden West. The
mode of capture is simple, for the wood is thin and
splits like a reed, revealing a row of well-conditioned
bardies, as the local Binghi terms them. Ten
minutes’ hunting in favorable country generally
secures a plateful of the beauties. Place them on
the coals till they pop, then sprinkle them with
pepper and salt, and the yolks of eggs nicely boiled
would be less acceptable to most palates.
“Me-Tax”: Pat the road-mender, from
Silver Creek, was blinking at the world again from
the verandah of the Sundowners’ Arms, after three
days of it. The pub magpie perched on the rail
and watched the recovering guest with great interest.
Suddenly it let out a shrill, “Who are you?” Pat
started back. “I’m Patrick O’Shovel, maintenance
man, Silver Creek, and”—swiping the surprised
maggie off his perch, “who the —-- are you, any-
how ?”

“Tenaculum” : The manna asked about by
“C.M.8.” (B. 12/7/T7) is an exudation from several
species of gum—notably Eucalyptus viminalis. There
are many such products, all more or less medicinal,
the best-known being the saccharine aperient ob-
tained from Fraxinus ornus (an ash-tree grown
chiefly in Sicily) and tamarisk-manna, believed to be
the kind which furnished food for the Israelites, and
which is still collected in the valleys of the Sinaitic
Peninsula.
*-* * *
“X.G.” : A fresh curse has introduced its
specialty to the man on the land out Coonamble way
(N.S.W.). Young sheep get the wool on their fore-
heads matted with the seed of star-grass, and the
patch becomes so thick and hard that it forces the
skin down over the eyes till the jumbuck goes blind
if not relieved. Press a hand on your forehead, forc-
ing the skin down over the eyes, and you have a
good idea how the poor woolly feels. The cure is
simple. Clip the mass off the forehead and the skin
will lift off the eyes in a little while.
* * * *
“Sliprail”: Don’t believe the current
nonsense about tongue-tied biillockies. Moonlight
Bill, the local oxen-conductor, had just pulled a load
of wheat alongside a stack, when his team saw a
cutting full of water just ahead and started for the
temperance bar. The waggon ploughed through the
corner of the stack, sending waves of wheat in every
direction, and if Bill hadn't used his whip on the
leaders and driven them up the bank the waggon
and team • would have gone headlong down hill to
a drunkard's grave. When he had his bullocks tied
up in a circle he simply grounded his whip and
addressed them like an angry general for 10 consecu-
tive minutes, without once repeating himself. Here
he was interrupted by a farmer who demanded pay-
ment for a broken waggon-pole smashed in the mix-
up. Then we saw that his scorching address to the
bullocks was only a tea-meeting effort. He denounced
the meanness of this farmer, and of all the farmers
that ever were, hurling in side references to the
NOT RESPONSIBLE.
TRUCULENT PERSON: “ What d’yer mean by lookin’ at. me like that?”
GLOOMY PERSON: “I ain’t lookin’ at yer like that."
TRUCULENT PERSON: “You are.”
GLOOMY PERSON: “I ain’t. It ain’t me. It’s me face.”
Wheat Pool, the mice plague, the rural-workers’ log
and the state of the roads, but always keeping in
touch with the main subject—the meanness of that
cocky. When he had concluded only the bullocks
remained. Gentlemen, Moonlight Bill! May his
glim never be doused !
“BE SURE YOUR GIN WILL FIND YOU OUT."
“Uloola” : Re big honey yields from one
bees’-nest (B. 12/7/T7. The ringer of all in my
experience was one that was blasted out of a pinna-
cle of rocks a mile or so from the dam at Cataract
(N.S.W.). It had been known for many years, but
was inaccessible till a few plugs of dynamite, bor-
rowed from the contractor's magazine, cleared a way
to it. The harvest was 12 kerosene-tins full of
honey in the comb, and then the whole of it wasn't
secured.
“Shadow”: For unconscious cruelty the
Australian aboriginal takes the bun. I was pros-
pecting up North and had camped near a waterhole
for dinner when my attention was suddenly drawn
to something splashing. I called the black boy and
said, “What name that fellow, Jackie?” Jackie:
“Tuckout belong to me.” “Tuckout belong to you!
What name him do there?” Jackie: “That pfeller
gohanna—mine been hobble him.” I made Jack go into
the water and bring the tucker out and found that he
had slit the skin on the side of the animal’s neck
and pushed its front forepaws through, thus very
effectively hobbling it. The gohanna, being amphibi-
ous, would keep alive in the water until his nib" was
ready for a gorge.
“Stapleton”: The nail-tailed Too is not
peculiar to W.A. (B. 10/5/’l7). It is frequently
found iu the N.T., where it is known as a pady-
melon. But I have never seen one with a sharp,
horny spine. The marsupials I have seen have had
simply a claw at the end of the tail, similar to the
claws of the feet. I have never been introduced to
a female, so, for all I know, the ornament is a male
prerogative.
“Albert O.” : I want to know the weight of
a cord of belah wood, green and dead; the weight of
a cord of box wood, green and dead ; and the weight
of a cord of pine, green and dead.

“Tacitus”: Malachi Dwyer was a well-
known character on the Westralian goldfields in the
early days. His distinguishing features were a
voice like thunder, feet like a stage policeman’s, a
well-developed appetite for beer and a mortal dread
of work. He swore off toil after the Ivanhoe-Venture
bust-up, in which Bigjohn Forrest figured promi-
nently, and but for one brief lapse, which was due
rather to an error of judgment than to a faltering of
purpose, he was true to his oath. Nobody ever
thought of offering him toil, until Clancy, who ran
the Government Labor Bureau, induced him, for the
sake of moral effect, to put his name down with
the rest of the unemployed. Malachi was the hun-
dred and third on the list for a job on the Kalgoorlie-
Boulder pipe line, and he looked pretty safe; but his
turn came with such marvellous swiftness- that he
was too stunned to point out that his talents fitted
him for something better than muek-shifing. While
he acce P tcd th e bureau docket, groped
half-blindly to the job in Hannan-street, collared a
shovel, shied a few pounds of earth over the top of
the trench, and swooned. When he revived suffi-
ciently to be led to the bar of the pub, he with a
pewter bible uplifted in his right hand, took a new
oath, which lie kept: “May Oi roide to Hell on fl
horns av the Divel if ivver agin Oi go widin a rn f
av a labor boroo.’’ Then with returning strengthV
added: “Thank God, I wuz not in me thrue°sin
when Oi tuk the job. That makes me
aisV, annyhow.”
“Bushy Bill”: Wild holly, which has been
the cause of many a masterpiece in cursing amon
cockydom around Cosford (N.S.W.), is extending jy
business rapidly. 1 recently found it on the nioun
tain peaks near Broken Bay, and as it germinate
quickly on sandy soil,, it. will take some shifting
I once traversed stretches of this district after
fire had seemingly killed all scrub-growth; but
within a month the holly’s shoots were winning the
war again. It was the only shrub which held up it s
head. This wild holly is a younger brother of the
European species, with the same projecting spikes and
useless habits.

“Dominie Sampson”: My experience of
the permanence of poison in the bones of poisoned
animals, and the consequent danger to other ani-
mals chewing them, bears out the contention of Mr
Williams, S.A. Chief Inspector of Stock. In north-
western N.S.W. it was not uncommon to lose dogs
owing to their chewing bones of sheep, etc., which
after dying or being killed, were poisoned with the
object of getting rid of dingoes. It was generally
believed that even fire would not take the death out
of them. A friend of mine lost two dogs through
their picking up bones which had been hung high up
in a tree and after several years had fallen to the
ground.
“Daybreak” : Benton left Smithsville well
tanked, and when about a mile on the road veered
into the scrub, dismounted, hitched his horse to a
tree and went to sleep. On awakening he staggered
to his feet and zigzagged for home without the
steed. Next day he returned, but could not find the
animal, nor were subsequent search parties anv
luckier. About 12 months later Buckridge came
upon a bridled and saddled skeleton at the foot of
a tree. It was all that remained of Denton’s nag.
The poor brute had eaten the bark and sap-wood off
the tree from the roots to as high as it could reach
and had an excavation tramped out round the butt
of the sapling deep enough to hold itself and all the
Bungs in the district. And to think that a jerk of
the head would have saved it all that suffering!
“Foolar”: “E.S.S.” (B. 12/7/T7) says
that the wonga is the pick of the bush pigeons.
Guess he hasn't tasted the green-pigeon, which con-
noisseurs say excels the wonga as the latter excels
the brown-pigeon. The wonga's flesh is white
but very dry and tasteless compared with the
“greenie.” Many who should know better say that
the Scrub-turkey, if full-grown, is too rank for a
white man’s table. I have never found this to be the
case if the spoil is soaked over nigfht in vinegar and
water.
TOOK HIS WORD FOR IT.
THE FADDIST: “My dear fellow, do you
l'now that I have lived for two years
on onions alone?"
THE PHILISTINE: “Well, I can quite believe
you did it alone."
“Sivad” : The hair-like substance off a cob
of ripe maize is a good substitute for tobacco. I've
tried everything from stringy bark to brown paper,
and place the above first. Next best is the root of
the wild-apple tree.

“Melb”: Mayor Ilennessy, in a well-
deserved farewell to Cyril Maude, said he had
uplifted the stage. Well, yes. I place Maude
as the most eminent comedian since Jeffer-
son. But how infinitely dissatisfied are we
old' critics who love really great acting in
great plays 1 Jefferson, Mathews, Creswick.
Brooke, Sullivan and the like went through
all their paces. Maude remains Grumpy to
the end. But don’t miss it. The character
is a sort of complete museum of antiquity.
Not the minutest stage trick can be added.
“S.S.”: Fritz Hart, of the Conserva-
torium in Melbourne, has a mission. He
aspires to give Australia something in the
way of a set of folk-songs all her own, and
he deserves better recognition than he re-
ceives. Yet he is seriously handicapped by
the fact that he is not Australia’s own. He
is an imported musician and poetaster, and
Australia has not soaked into him, or lie has
not soaked sufficiently in Australia, with the
result that clever songs like “Wild Bees” and
“Whalin’ up the Lachlan,” although receiv-
ing excellent interpretation, just fail to hit
the Australian where he lives. But it’s worth
trying and Hart, with the aid of an un-
doubted Australian bush-bard, should get
there yet.
“H.”: There are two or three veteran
Australian theatregoers in London. One of
them, W. Howard Smith, was lately present
at the revival of “Maritana” by the Carl
Rosa Co. Looking up his collection of play-
bills, he discovered that he had witnessed
the opera at the Melbourne Royal in 1804,
given -by Lyster’s Grand Opera Co., with
Lucy Escott, Georgia Hudson, Henry
Squires and J. E. Ivitts as principals.
“J.F.H.” from London :
The Carl Rosa Opera Co. is having a splendid sea-
sou at the Garrick, with one of Victoria’s numerous
nightingales, Beatrice Miranda, as prima donna. She
has made a big hit in the Verdi operas, notably
“Aida” and “II Trovatore.” A huge Saturday night
crowd rolled up for the revival of “Maritana,’ the
melodious mixture concocted by William \incent
Wallace, who taught the piano and violin in Sydney
in the ’3o’s and found a generous friend in his
fellow-Hibernian, Governor Bourke. One and perhaps
the main reason for the thronged house was the re-
appearance of the most popular of tenors, Ben Davies.
He started 30 years ago in the Carl Rosa Co., but
for a long time has deserted opera in favor of
oratorio and concert-hall work. Ben had a demon-
strative welcome back and repaid it. Seeing that
Wallace beyond all question was the greatest com-
poser that ever lived in Australia, his operas ought
to be far more familiar to Commonwealth audiences
than they are. There may still he surviving in
Sydney someone who remembers him. There are
certainly plenty who remember his sister, Madame
VVallace-Bushelle, who lived down to a comparatively
recent period and was for many years one of the
principals of the choir of St. Mary’s Cathedral. A
brother, John W T allace, dropped dead while playing
in the orchestra of the Geelong Theatre Royal—pro-
bably the only instance of such a tragically-sudden
exit in Australian theatrical history. The case of
Federiei, who died in a Melbourne theatre "hen
playing the rdle of Mephistopheles, is the nearest
approach to it.
“Ato” : The frenzied economics of the pic-
ture showman ! The flicker merchant of a
year ago had a circuit of towns, showing a
certain night weekly in each place and paying
a week’s hire for his film. That’s clean out
of date. One Victorian showman lias three
balls, Ringwood, Box Hill and Surrey Hills,
and he shows the same films on all the
screens on the same night. Lately he began
his show at Ringwood with “The Daughter
of the Gods.” When the first reel was fin-
ished a motor rushed away with it to Box
Hill, picked up the “comic” that was shown
there first and took it to Surrey Hills. M
Surrey Hills he collected the “scenic” that
had opened the night and bolted up to Ring-
wood, where the second reel of “The Daughtei
of the Gods” was now finished. And so the
game continued all the evening. Next morn-
ing the box of reels was returned to the
hiring agency after having been shown to
three full houses. Some night that motoi
will break down and three audiences and one
showman will explode.
“Row A.” ; “Kirribilli” (B. 26/7/17) re-
proves “Midchannel” (B. 19/7/17) for
accusing the J.G.W. firm of “not encouraging
local talent” and, to prove his case, recites
a list of Australian names, including those
of Dorothy Brunton, Percy, Leslie, and others
By all means chalk it up to the credit of the
Firm, though in helping those clever locals,
the Firm was only helping itself. But toe
players are not the only deserving ones.
There are Australian playwrights the P 1"
duction of xvhose works on an adequa
scale might prove a good investment for tn
J.C.W. people, if they were prepared
take a business risk occasionally ins .
of acting merely as importers _of fore l ?
successes. Has “Kirribilli” a list of Aus-
tralian authors who have been given a chanc
by the big Australian firm? And how abo
local composers other than the Firm’s o"
conductois?
AH, WHY?
[FOR THE BULLIN.]
Why did you marry, Rosalie?
Why leave the limelight’s glow?
How very dear you were to me
You now will never know.
Why did you wed ? The stage’s the place
For such vivacity and grace.
Why did you wed? I see you yet,
So dainty and so slim,
Poised like, the smoke of cigarette,
A poem every limb.
Why did you marry, Rosalie?
The stage is empty now and dree!
What could the married life afford
As fine as that you knew —
The plaudits of the happy horde,
Joy, love and homage too?
But since you must wed, Rosalie,
Oh, why—why did you marry me?

“Glen Iris” : Full-breasted table-fowls are
rare birds nowadays. Mostly they are lean
and wistful ancients, razor-chested and crip-
pled with scaly-leg, assembled for sale owing
to the bursting-up of the poultry-farmer who
has tried to ration his stock on green-feed
and hope. It is no good trying to build up
the industry on a foundation of wrong farm-
ing practice. The three-acre farmer will
never succeed. The only people who make
money on the year’s turnover are: (1) The
auctioneer-agent; (2) the shopkeeper and
dealer; (3) the few-acred poultry expert
who has made a lifelong study of the game
and, after many years, has built up a repu-
tation with his stud-stock; (4) the farmer
who grotcs his own feed throughoutj and
(5) the runs half a dozen
chooks in the backyhrd and feeds them
on table-scraps. Only one thing ever hap-
pens to the poultry-farmer who tries to make
a living by selling eggs and fowl-meat at
wholesale, while buying his feed at retail.
And this, by the way, is the industry which
is more often mentioned than any other as
a suitable one for the returned soldier !

“The Possum” : In the art of lifting the
cream of a gold-sluicer’s wash-up from the
head of the race, after perhaps an eight-
weeks’ run-off, Ah Sin is science sifted and
fitted with two stealthy legs capable of get-
ting around with less noise than snowflakes
falling on to a sheep’s back. Years ago an
old digger watched for three nights at his
claim for the Chink he suspected of tapping
his race, and his good old muzzle-loading
shotgun, well charged with swan-drop, was
deputed to formally welcome the visitor. At
near midnight came the Ghost, a wrinkled
old Chinaman well known as a leading
specialist in the line. Without waiting to
turn off the water, he pulled out a yard or
so of paving-stones and stooped to shovel the
stuff into his buckets. The sluicer’s eyes
had a murderous glint in them as he steadily
took aim at the dungaree target stooping in
the race. “Bang!” and the Ghost hopped
six feet skyward. On alighting his hands
were-clutching at the punctured rear of his
premises, and he yelled, “Whaffor. whnffor,
whaffor you no gammon-shootem ?” Coarse
salt or gravel was the usual thing on such
occasions, and John considered that swan-
drop as a substitute wasn’t.playing the game.
* * * *
“Foolar”: This will show you what a
forest crop may be worth. H. Gresinger,
sen., cut and drew to market in one week a
hoop-pine grown on Perch Creek, Tweed
River (N.S.W.), that gave 12.789 ft. of flaw-
less timber. At Bs. per 100 ft. it cleared
£5O 16s.
“.T. Hop” : The d.’s are up a fe -«iinst a new
set of tricks in the safe-burgling line. One
Melbourne gang of cracksmen is modern
enough to employ an oxy-acetylene plant,
and, in the guise of a mechanic, a member
of the firm attended the Working Men’s
College and took lessons in its use. In
order to deaden the sound of blowing open
a safe, a motor-cycle was recently set to
work back-firing outside the premises. An
original plan was followed when £4O w T orth
of jewellery was lifted from a Collingwood
shop. It was intended to remove the safe,
and in order that the removal should not be
discovered too promptly, the “boxmen” made
an elaborate cardboard dummy to put in its
place. The cardboard was painted black
and green, the door was gilded, a keyhole
was made, and most careful of all was the
gilding of the wooden knob which repre-
sented the handle. Apparently the real safe
was too heavy to shift, and the dummy was
left behind in disgust.
* * * *
“Quidam” : Now that calcium carbide has
bounded up to £62 a ton wholesale, it would
not be amiss to consider whether Australia
couldn’t manufacture its own. Seeing
we have water-power, lime, and coal for eoj >
the matter should not be out of the question.
Even Niagara would have produced no
if Uncle Sam had sat down
because there was a larger fall
besi. Time enough to sing out about our
"poverty” of water-power when what is iu
ning to waste now is in harness and woiknis
to its fullest possibility! Australia s great-
est disadvantage is not lack ot nveis, but its
dreadful tendency to pay people for talki g
instead of doing, and the horrible ignorance
of the bulk of its population about anything
outside the few coastal towns they live in.
Somebody saw a chance to earn a copper
the other day without working for it an
went after it with both bands ?P e . u ' r ,
the wool clip was sold to the British Govern-
ment and valued at £24,294,064, 10 per cent,
was held in every case against a final a
justment. Now, if anybody knew 01 sus-
pected that the deducted sum was to be le
turned there was an opening to get on a
good wicket for £2,313,460 was m suspense.
Wherefore Pirate Enterprise got busy and
rushed off notices to individual growers tnat
there was someone waiting' to pay spot ca.
for the undivided money. It is a matter ot
guesswork how many wool-cockies fell l
and how far, but the scheme was after a
week or two knocked on the head by the
Federal Government prohibiting deals ot the
kind suggested. And bang went a beautiful
chance of biting the wool cocky tor halt a
million or so!
“F.N.T.”: Nowadays the Melbourne
dailies fairly teem with snide ads. There
is the "lady going into mourning” who wants
to sell a silk dress, the patriotic motor-bike
owner who is about to depart on active ser-
vice, the doctor giving up his suburban prac-
tice and desirous of trading his nearly-new
furniture, all at a fearful sacrifice, and all
daily calling with plaintive urgency for im-
mediate action. The “lady in mourning
can usually be traced to an shop in
some squalid suburban stret. The bike-
owner is usually unconcerned with the
trouble in Europe, being otherwise engaged
in furbishing-up old machines. The “doctor
is an earnest old man with a large nose, a
false idea of a fair thing and a difficulty In
pronouncing th. There are dozens of others
equally simple in their methods and equally
grasping when it comes to a deal and what
a lot of customers they must reach in order
to justify their persistent advertising!
* * * *
“Murkah”: “Enrobso” (B. 5/7/T7) com-
plains of fading lights each time his electri-
cally-lighted suburban train stopped. It must
have been due to defective installation. Bj
the latest system, when the cars are moving
at a sufficient rate of speed (anything over
five miles an hour) the current is supplied
to the lights direct from the dynamo ; when
the train falls below generating speed the
dvnamo “cuts out ’ and the load is taken up
by a battery of accumulators. Therefore it
is merely a matter of selecting a dynamo
and accumulators of suitable output, and
the current supplied to the lights can-
not fall below a certain minimum.
Nor, by a simple arrangement of
chokes, can the current received by the
lights exceed a prearranged maximum. When
in the Queensland Railways I commonly saw
accumulators, after standing all night, sup-
ply a brilliant light to an early-morning
train. #
“Splitter” : The district stretching between
the Paterson and Karuah rivers (N.S.W.)
is the wealthiest in timber that I’ve seen
for many a day. Ironbark, tallow-wood,
blackbutt, spotted, blue and grey gums, tur-
pentine (up to 150 ft. in -the gullies)—-
they’re all there ; and among the soft woods
there are millions of feet of white cedar,
beech and teak. All this timber is within
200 miles of Sydney, and easily accessible
from the North Coast railway; yet before
me is a circular from the “trade” that, be-
ginning from July 1, timber will be advanced
another ss. per thousand feet. That makes
about 75 per cent, rise since the war burst.
What for? Not' to pay extra cash to the
mills or the men who swing the axe; they
get along at much the same old price, and
have' to be contented with if.
“Exile”:' The biggest fraternal and
friendly society in California is the Native
Sons of the Golden West, with 25,000 mem-
bers. It is founded on similar lines to the
A.N.A., but is not used merely as a means
for politicians to foist themselves on a long-
suffering country. The Native Sons do
their best work in preserving old landmarks
and in aiding native painters, sculptors and
musicians to earn a living in their own coun-
try, instead of driving them abroad to battle
amongst strangers for porridge and butter-
milk.
* * * *
“Branx” : It is about time that Australia
considered the wisdom or otherwise of allow-
ing imported goods to bear typical Austra-
lian brands. The practice cannot fail to
have a harmful effect on the value of local
names for advertising local goods. On my
shelves I have such brands as “Kookaburra,”
“Kangaroo,” “Commonwealth” and “Boom-
erang,” all of them on foreign stuff. These
names ought to mean to the consumer “made
by Australians,” and no doubt to many they
do —which is precisely why they are used
and precisely why they shouldn’t be allowed
to be used.
“C.F.E.”: “Agricola” is right when he
speaks of the sad results following the con-
stant use of “super” in Southern Victoria.
I have had many weary tramps with the
spring tooth cultivator on the hottest days
of summer, tearing up the rank growth of
sorrel which flourished luxuriantly after the
use of acid fertiliser's (super and sulphate
of ammonia). Since then I have spread lime
in the autumn on land in preparation for
spring and summer crops. I also find that
field-peas counteract the acidity. Our de-
partmental experts are, by the way, endea-
voring to persuade the railways to carry lime
free—as is done in Maoriland—pointing out
that the increased fertility of the soil means
increased freights and revenue; but the Com-
missioners can’t see farther than the sub-
urbs.
MY PROSPECTS.
[FOR THE BULLIN.]
My prospects are and always were
In aspect somewhat azure-hued.
Their color gives me no surprise,
Since, I’ll confess, they all are blewed.
I’ve read a score of mournful bards
Who weep the loss of yesterday;
For me I live three weeks ahead —-
So flows the stream of cash away.
A young man of the future, I
For sorrow need not search the past:
I spent the cash of two weeks hence
And something more on Monday last.
The grocer languishes unpaid ;
The milkman mourns his cashless lot;
The landlord with a furtive eye
Sums up the furniture I’ve got.
I’m always up against the odds;
Although quite frequently'l pay, .
My money always goes upon
That worst of dead ’uns, Yesterday.
I run accounts, yet never catch
The debts of days that I have passed;
They always fly ahead of me —
And yet they say I live too fast.
Still with some little money blest
(Drawn on the hopes of Friday week),
There dwells no fear within my heart,
No sip from Sorrow’s cup I seek.
I know that when that cash is done
More weeks of credit stretch ahead,
So shall I flourish in advance
Until the time when I am dead.
And then I’ll score a point from Death
By having lived a week or two
Ahead of things. My creditors
May then their prospects reckon blue.

cult to get.
WHY?
Because the Belgian cutters are no
more.
England cuts but very few diamonds.
America has never cut any.
Germany is out of it.
Holland does the world’s work in cut-
ting now, but the German sub-
marines have practically stopped
the export of the cut gems and
the import of the uncut.

America has bought heavily lately, so has Russia, and hence prices are soaring V

POLITICAL
POINTS
HOW THE LITTLE MAN NEVER
FEELS.
THE TALL BRUSH: “When one sees these
Old Masters, one takes one's hat off and
feels small.”
THESHOUT ONE: “l Veil, I’m damned if I
do!”
Melbourne Trades Hall Council, having!
called a special meeting to consider thej
unemployed problem, left its brains at home;
and duly arrived at the conclusion that the;
best solution was to “shorten the hours of;
labor so as to absorb more workers.” Well,
why not start at home? The Trades Hall
Council has one secretary, Say he gets. £4
a week. Let it shorten the sec.’s hours and
employ two other secs. —there are plenty of
unemployed clerks. Of course the other two
will also get £4 a week each ; so it will cost
the Trades Hall Council £l2 instead of £4
to get the same work done. But that
mustn’t be allowed to matter. It solves the
problem. The Trades Hall Council says so.
If it doesn’t solve the problem for this body
it doesn't solve it for any body.
An overhaul of . the affairs of, the Camp
Fay section of the Defence Department, so
far as it is possible to overhaul them, dis-
closes that Howell' Price got away with
£67,012. Pearce, who permitted affairs to
drift into the state of chaos which made
these defalcations possible, is still Minister
of the Department. No matter how grossly
incompetent he is. under the party system
there is no punishment for a Minister so
long as he says “Aye” at the right moment
and brings in votes at election time.
CONVINCING EVIDENCE.
FIRST OFFICER: “Good! And how about
your riding? How are you gettingalong
with that?”
SECOND OFFICER: “Oh, ripping! I even
ventured to puss that camp of beastly
Australians this morning.”
Voluntary recruiting is doing splendidly
in Melbourne. For the first empty-saddle
parade of the Win-the-War girls members
decided to change-their colors, and prepared
for the event by spending £5O or so, out of
their private purses, on cherry-silk ribands
and plenty of ’em. The result of the day’s
outing was one whole recruit. Germany does
it just like that, of course.
“Pat O'Maori” has an inspiration:—
Let us nil i-trike. There seems to he no special
reason why, with the .'spring coming “on and the
wattle bursting into fragrant bloom, anybody should
demean hipiself by taking on so poor a thing as a
job. There is no difficulty about finding- an excuse.
The'confounded card system employed by the baker
and butcher to check the amount we cat ought to
rouse our inborn spirit of freedom to the fiercest
resentment. Why should a check be put upon Ihe
extent of our chops and steak? Why should a tally
be made of the bread-"we consume? Is it not the
public rain and sun that causes the wheat to ripen
and the bullock to grow? Let them l>e free to all
men; or, if some cash is required, let us pay for
them as we please and when we please. Why should
the man who gives the butcher £2 • ss. fid. have
more than the man who gives him Is. 7-Id. ? The
iniquity of the systein is not less real because we
have patiently endured it so long. Let us all strike
at once, and s-0 get the best out of the happy spring-
time that is filling the world with pink boronia
blossoms and bird-song.
For years past the Parliamentary Labor
party sowed the wifid, and the N. S. Wales
railway and tram strike is the whirlwind
which the community has to reap. Hundreds
of thousands of men have been continually
reminded of their power; no attempt has
been made to show them their responsibili-
ties. The Labor leaders should have been
educationists; instead, they have been merely
hucksters bidding for votes. It is not the
men at the head of the Labor party now
who are most to blame for the present
deplorable state of affairs. It is the men
who, having sown the seed, didn't like the
look of the harvest and lately left the
party. To-day they are doing the old thing
on the other side. Here, for instance, is
the Sydney Telegraph, one of the strongest
supporters of the Hughes Government, can-
didly admitting that certain people.who had
made large war profits had been exempted
from the war-profits tax for the sake of
securing their political support. Having
encouraged Labor to have no sense of civic
responsibility, Capital is now being simi-
larly corrupted. And the newspapers regard
such enemies of the people as statesmen !
In the House of Reps.:—
Mi'. Hughes said he did not retract one word he
had said against the men who had exploited the
people of Australia. They were the people who
mouthed about patriotism and' at the same time
filled their pockets.
Mr. Blakeley: “Well, what are you going to do
about them?”
Mr. Hughes: “1 am not going to mince my words
about them."
And there you have Mr. Hughes’s most ad-
equate description of Mr. Hughes. He is the
statesman who. when asked what lie is going
to do, replies that he is going to make a
speech.
The establishment of soldiers in “new” in-
dustries is painfully slow work. Take toy-
making. The t’ollingwood Tech.,
which is doing what it can to push
this infant industry along for the
benefit of discharged Billjim. has
published the results of its labors in
training and placing men. Four re-
turned soldiers have found factory
jobs and two others have been estab-
lished in businesses of their own, and
—but there’s no more. The tale
stops there, and the figures relating
to Little Bill's next Christmas-box
will probably indicate that, for every
six Australians employed at making
his pretty little breakables, some 6000
Japanese toilers have been hard at
work. Does this convey nothing to
the Chin-and-Jaw party? What sense
is there in blocking repatriation—
which counts a lot in recruiting—by
admitting these floods of foreign
stuff?
It. .T. Stuart-Robertson, the physi-
cally big man of the House, has been
elected chairman of the N. !S. Wales
Labor party. When first elected 10
years ago lie. had much trouble with
the officials and the press to preserve
the “Stuart” and the hen-roost before
his name. He was a descendant of
the Royal Stuarts, he explained. He
probably is. lie certainly has the
family knack of doing tactless things
and getting into trouble.
Put it to the credit of this X. S. Wales
Government that it has produced the Esti-
mates within six weeks of the opening of
the financial year. What now remains to
be done is to get the boiling oil ready for
any officer, in Parliament or out of it. who
splashes up money without Parliamentary
sanction. It is not a bit of use bringing the
Estimates in early if they are disregarded
afterwards. If that is permitted they might
just as well be left over, as hitherto, till the
money has been spent.
Questioned lately in the House about the
embargo on American apples. Prime Minister
Hughes stated that the embargo was in force
and would continue “until the Australian
market became so empty of Australian apples
that American could be imported without
affecting the prospects of Australian fruit.”
That’s all right, but what has the Australian
manufacturer done that he shouldn’t have
his home market reserved to him until im-
portations from, say, America or Japan
wouldn’t affect his prospects? Incidentally,
who was it said just before the elections
that it was at present impossible to give
Australia protection—against a glut of
American apples, for instance —-for fear of
offending an Allied nation?
By pushing the public debt up from
£130.514.01 S to £130.138.347 last financial
year and accumulating a deficit of £2(58,772
on an expenditure of £20,808,400, N. S.
Wales managed to stagger along to the place
for making a fresh start. According to the
Budget produced by Fitzpatrick last week,
the expenditure during the current year will
he cut down to a mere £22,417,810," and the
debt forcibly prevented from climbing beyond
£145,000,000, or thereabouts. So the Bill
goes on—up —up—up ! And Fitzpatrick,
being a cheerful sort of fatalist, folds his
hands, remarks that the Lord only knows
what may happen, and lets it got at that.
P.M.G. Webster lias another word :
Tun Bulletin’s effort to justify previous state-
ments reminds me that there are none so blind as
those who will not see. The £1,854,271 referred
to was money spent from general revenue on realis-
able assets, in accord with the paper’s own pet
policy. It appears that, if we borrow money out-
side in order to build up assets, essential and repro-
ductive, we give The Bulletin offence; yet if we
carry out such works from revenue, we are also
pilloried.
Webster is apparently quite hopeless.

this cable being sent-on April 23—12 thus
before the election. And when his ruffled
feelings have been soothed, Ofcanne might
say just what he thinks of himself for charg-
ing this debt-laden country with his expenses
as a sight-seer at Weymouth — £s 2s. 3d. for
four days—while he was drawing his Par-
liamentary salary and army pay. That the
amount was handed over without protest
shows liow easily the Parliamentarian may
dip into th(> public bag. The public supply
of motor-cars for private use and other things
of that kind constitute one of the scandals of
public life in Australia. The thing has
grown outrageously during the last few years.
One of the innumerable curses of the so-
eallcd voluntary system is that people spring
I'D all over the country suggesting tremen-
dous bribes for recruits. While Millen
talks of spending £60,000.000 in settling re-
turned soldiers on the land, well-meaning
enthusiasts like a committee at Lismore
(X.S.W.) get busy advocating other things
like this:—-
To further the scheme of voluntary recruiting... .that
returned men be drafted to temporary military homes,
in t lie centre from which they enlisted; that the
mothers, wives and children of these men be allowed
free railway passes; and that they (the men)'be
kept under military discipline and pan until such
time as every means lias been availed of to place each
man in a safe position and his future secured, so far
as is humanly possible. No man to be discharged
till that is accomplished.
<)f course not one in a hundred of these
beautiful schemes can be carried into effect.
THE VITAL QUESTION.
BOY: “I am going to be a soldier!”
GTUL : “Well, when will I start- drawing
your pay?” ,
But they are circulated among men who have
small means of getting to know what has
been agreed to, and what somebody with-
out authority has merely proposed to do; and
when Billjim comes back and finds that life
is much the same old life, only perhaps a
little more difficult, there is another returned
man with a grievance. These well-meaning
people really make recruiting more difficult
instead of easier.
THE COMMON MEN
[FOR THE BULLIN.]
“The great mail of this war is the common man.
The acts of the small man dwarf all the pretensions
of the Great Man.”-—//, ft. Wells.
The great, men framed the fierce decrees
Embroiling State with State:
They bit 'their thumbs- across l lie seas
In diplomatic: hate;
They lit .the pyre whose glare and heat
Make licll itself seem cold;
The flames bloomed red above the "wheat,
Their wild profusion wreathed the street—
Then in the smoke and fiery sleet
The common men took hold.
Where Babel was with Bedlam freed,
And wide the gates were flung
To chaos, while the anarch breed
In all the world gave tongue,
The common men in close array,
By mountain, plain and sea,*
Went outward, girded for the fray,
On one dear quest, whate’er they pay
In blood and pain—the open way
To keep for Liberty.
The common men who never tiro,
Unsightly in the mirk
Of caking blood and smoke and mire,
Push forward with their work;
A while in foulest pits entombed,
Resistless, still and slow.
Burnt, broken, stifled, seeming doomed,
Past where the flowers of Hell have bloomed,
Up gutted hills with shell-breath plumed,
The stubborn armies go.
Contending in the shattered sky
In empyrean wars,
The sons of simple men out-vie
God's splendid meteors ;
Where’er the mills of Vulcan roared
And blinked against the night,
Swart shapes with sweat-washed eyes have stored
The clean, lean lightnings of the I*o rd
To be a league-long, leaping sword
In this our holy fight.
The small men know the burden well,
The dreadful paths - they know,
With fear and death and torture dwell,
And sup and sleep with woe.
They’re riven in the shrapnel gust,
But, blind and reeling, plan
Another blow, a final thrust
To subjugate the tyrant's lust.
So, bleeding, blundering in the dust,
Men fight and die for MAN.
VICTORIA.

SPORTING
The Australian Hurdle Race, run in mod-
erately good time on a sticky track, was an interest-
ing race in all respects. With the field reduced to
1G the betting was 6 to 1 against four of them at
the start, and 10 to 12 to 1 against four others,
among the eight outsiders being Coronatus, w'ho came
in second because Merunqua blundered at the last
jump. The public retained faith in BundOng to the
very last, although that unhappy maiden hurdler had
practically -proved himself to be staling off by a
feeble performance in a flat race three days previ-
ously. On Saturday the disappointing animal began
to tire, apparently, before the end of the third mile,
while his old adversary, Merunqua, was still sticking
tp the job with only Polygamist to beat. King Mos-
tyn was quite blown cftif- when Polygamist got the
lead from him half a mile from home. Then it
became a question whether the English horse would
clear the remaining hurdles. He came to the final
ordeal a length or more ahead of Merunqua. It was
an exciting moment. With Hugh Cairns —who had
the mount on the Grand National winner—it was a
case of now or never. He had a similar experience
last year when he flew Van Homreigh at last
jump and did the trick. This time he flew bis mount
just as Polygamist was sprawling safely over the
obstacle. But the fates were against him. He took
the risk and came to grief. Merunqua hit the rail
hard enough to tilt the crack jockey out of the
saddle, and Polygamist was left to win easily from
old Coronatus, with Van Homreigh five lengths fur-
ther back. Probably the imported stallion would
have won in any case, though not easily. He had
101 b. the best' of the weights compared with his
luckless pursuer, and he was by far the most classy
animal in the field. His success came doubly rough
qn Cairns, who had failed to make him run kindly
at Flemington in his second public performance over
the sticks. Since then Boyd had discovered how to
make the handsome rogue run honestly. Moreover,
he had been getting into condition, whilst the light-
fleshed geldings opposed to him were (lisimproving
with their gentle work. Polygamist doesn’t jump
cleverly as yet. His final effort on Saturday wa|
strikingly amateurish. But it sufficed. He got over
the wood. And in hits clumsy way he jumped straight.
The minor steeplechase at Caulfield revealed a
couple of possibles, in Union Arms and San Leandro,
for the 4-mile race next Saturday. The former
dropped his rider when he looked like winning, and
the latter actually won, after taking a bit out of
himself by a 2-mile gallop in a steeplechasers’ flat
race earlier in the afternoon. There are at least a
dozen possibles in the Australian Steeplechase at
time of writing—some of them only barely possible if
the accidents are not more numerous than usual, but
still worth eonsring. The fencing capabilities of
the recognised hurdlers who have accepted is an
unknown quantity in most cases. If Old Mungindi,
Caibye, Waimai, Booligal, Battleship and other estab-
lished steeplechasers are to be put to shame, it will
have to be a hurdler that runs away from them. Or
Bessie May. How about the Bessie who won the
steeplechasers’ flat-race so very easily and is let into
the big Steeple at 9st. 71b.? If she,can jump and
stay four miles the mare must have a fair chance to
beat the erseks at a difference of 351 b. and more.
The writer fancies Mungindi best of the top weights,
but is prepared to bear the shock of a great surprise
—which will probably be supplied by something
weighted at not more than lOst. 81b. The Australian
Steeple- is.a terribly; .long race, and no gee knows his
luck. Backers of coincidences will fancy Bessie May
on the ground that horses and mares are compara-
tive rarities in jumping races. Polygamist was the
first horse in 15 years to win the Hurdle, and it’s
longer than that since a mare captured the Steeple.
Imported Polygamist, winner of the Aus-
tralian Hurdles at Caulfield, was given up for dead
while on the way to Australia. The steamer on
which be was a pampered passenger caught fire three
days out from Durban, and was reported lost. How-
ever, ill-luck didn’t blow as bad as that: the lame
duck was rescued. But as the horse’s coming fame
was hardly thought of his salvage didn't excite any
great interest.
The most successful Australian sire of the
1916-17 season was Linacre, whose family won in
stakes £21,396. The Welkin was second and Bobadil
third. Pistol’s progeny supplied the largest number
of different winners 491 (the 1 is a dead-heat),
while Bobadil’s offspring won the largest number of
races —125.
As the arrangements for the weekly meet-
ing got into collision with the strike, there was
nothing doing at Warwick Farm (Sydney) on Satur-
day. Wherefore the breeding of thoroughbreds could
only be supported by rushing to the trots' or New-
castle, or staying at home and having a bet on the
next union to down tools. Industrial happenings
offer as much uncertainty for a flutter as the hurdles
on a suburban course, and if Ike could only be in-
duced to operate in a big way some of the unions
might retrieve enough to pay for going without
wages.
At the Clarence River (N.S.W.) Pony
Club’s meeting the other day fully two punters for-
sook Israel and gave the tote a chance. In the first
race the solitary investor picked the winner. A divi-
dend of Bs. 6d. was declared, and the far-seeing indi-
vidual who had lost Is. 6d. through backing the right
animal was subjected to vulgar and derisive noises
from Ike. In the next race the investor was on the
second horse. He also got away with Bs. Gd. Net
.result: For the Government, 2s. 31(1. ; for the club
(to encourage racing and liquidate the cost of run-
ning the machine), Sid.
One of the owners who seemed to have been
taken into partnership by Luck last year was
D. U. Seaton, of Sydney. But it looks now as if
the partnership had been surreptitiously dissolved.
At any rate, when Wolaroi went lame he didn’t
get better, and is more or less under a cloud
still. Also when Seaton paid 700 guineas last sea-
son for an own brother to Pah King, winner of the
Maribyrnong Plate, he didn’t reckon that this
valuable horseflesh would go and bash itself into
a fence preparatory to having a funeral last week.
As another youngster that Seaton acquired died
soon afterwards, there semes to be a hoodoo on the
premises, ,
After pondering for many weeks over the
mystery of the pony with many aliases (the last of
which was Esmee H.), N.S.W. 'Associated Pony
Clubs’ stewards passed those responsible for the
ringing-in outside the course for life. The swindle
got its full measure so far as the clubs are con-
cerned ; all the same, they might reasonably have
lent their weight to the Law for an even bigger
punch.
Young Leslie Bragg, who was astride of
Downcry in the big smash at Canterbury Park last
Saturday week, knew nothing about what happened
afterwards. He died four days later. Bragg was
17 and apprenticed to Chippendall, trainer of Quino-
logist and Co. His death ought to make someone
ask questions about the size of the fields allowed to
run on these suburban courses. Twenty-five, mostly
ridden by inexperienced boys, means calling tenders
for trouble.
Richard Wootton lately wrote to a friend
in Sydney that racing in England was looking no
better and he was thinking of going out of busi-
ness and returning to Australia unless there was a
quick recovery. The probabilities are strongly
against anything happening to keep Richard from
making the change, for the war is a long way from
over, and even when it is a thing of the past happy
days are not going to return within a week or tw r o.
First of all, there have been great changes in
the studs already. Then racing is very largely a
social, fashionable
business in England,
and social England
has been hit on a
sore place. And there
is the further con-
sideration that those
who have done most
for breeding and rac-
ing in the Cold
Country are being
frightfully mauled
in their incomes.
There is certainly
not a fraction of the
money to be made in
England by the pro-
fessional in the game
that could be piled
up a few years ago.
The future of the
sport in Australia
may in some respects
be doubtful, and it
i« well that it should
be; but there will
probably always be
plenty of it, for it
has a far stronger
hold on the people
generally than in
most other places.
As long as the ani-
mals have four legs
and Ike is on the
premises, the rest
doesn’t matter much.

Baronet.
A. W. Cox, who races in the disguise of
“Fairie,” has been as successful with horses in Eng-
land as he was with Broken Hill shares in Australia.
Gay Crusader, winner of the Two Thousand, won the
Derby for him last week ,at Newmarket. Seven years
ago. he captured the event at Epsom with Limburg,
and last year was second with Ivwa'tig Su. But he
lately had a strealj of bad luck in losing Bayardo,
sire of Gay Crusader, a ;smashing good- horse both on
the track and at the stiud. Gay Crusader is spoken
of by English writers as rather weedy-looking, very
much up in the air. He was beaten at Newmarket
last April by the Fowling Piece gelding Coq d’Or.
In the Two Thousand Guineas he had a desperate
race with Magpie, a colt by Dark Ronald, then
owned by Major Astor. Coq d’Or and Magpie were
since purchased for Australia, the first by Clark and
Robinson, and Magpie by Lionel Robinson. They
were expected tq arrive during this week.

The big money that is waiting to be
picked up by any plain Government lottery for war
or other purposes can be guessed from the way in
which even quiet Adelaide came at a “candle-burning
competition” in connection with Australia Day. The
four-foot candle, erected in a Rundle-street- porch,
drew big crowds, and the ‘chance of winning £lOO
for a shilling drew thousands of guesses, which had
to be sorted out according to the number of days
they named —for there was a wild variety in the
shots made. However, guesses were taken for some
time after Mayor Isaacs had lit up, and by that
time from five days to six looked a good tip. * What
a gamble it all was is shown by the fact that at
10 a.m., two hours before the sixth day ended, the
last of the candle collapsed. That should reasonably
have been the end; but the wick floated and burnt
comfortably in a sea of wax till after midnight, with
the judges holding stop-watches on it all the time.
Official verdict, 6 days 12hrs. 33mins. 15sec.
Llew Edwards handed Matty Smith at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday a full-sized helping of
what the Taffies presented the Kaiser’s “Cock< haters"
with a day or two before at Bixchoote. The Lord
only knows what Smith thought he hail.struck, but
it didn’t matter, anyhow. Frightfulness assailed
him from all angles simultaneously and from the
start, and within osec. the horrified Yank discovered
that the enemy was digging entrenchments through
his anatomy with 14 purposeful gloves. Smith
escaped from the first round with his head on, but
started hitting the mat with it so frequently in the
second that the Court rushed in and, pulling Edwards
off, ordered the massacre to stop.
Wave Geike just stayed long enough to
get acquainted with Eugene Volaire at Brisbane on
Saturday. The Bananalander jumped in and indus-
triously belted Eugene in the midriff for the best
part of three rounds. It looked like a sultry evening
for France. But things turned out differently. In
the effort to dodge a woodener monsieur retreated;
Geike missed and fell on top of a left hook. The
effect was excellent from Volaire’s point of view,
and some more of the same, with greater emphasis,
settled the argument in the fifth. Geike remarked
subsequently that he had an idea something hit him.
Sydney Soccer football ended on Saturday,
when Annandale rushed to its suburban dugout with
the premiership. Out of 14 matches, Annandale won
12 and piled up 55 goals against 22. Last season
the club went through without defeat and scored 57
goals to eight. Since being launched in ’l3 it has
won 45 games out of 68.
There was sonic hair-raising football
the other day at Rockhampton when the Mt. Morgan
braves invaded the premises. Early in the proceed-
ings the ancient a:* oi ivrving the blucher was
revived, and eventually plavcis, spectators, officials
and John Hops got in a heap, and had a Prirograd
all to themselves. It took the police a quarter of
an hour to boot the homicides apart, whereupon the
game was renewed. The result? Oh, yes. Rock-
hampton won—lB to 3.

The Canterbury (M.L.) Rugby Union has
started out to launch the one-big-union idea for
control of the game. The Rugby governors of the
Isles have discovered that Soccer and League may be
unhealthy rivals later on, not to say anything about
hockey, which is making big strides. The English
Union is too conservative to make radical changes
in the game, and having adopted the five-yards-from-
the-line in the line-out rule cannot be expected to
do much more for 10 .years. But Canterbury wants
Australian and Maoriland and S’African reps, on an
“Empire” Union to boost up the game and inci-
dentally get the Canadians interested. All the Maori-
land unions are being asked to lend a hand, and if
the project is not talked to death something may
come of it.
The death of Captain W. R. Aspinall. in
France, added another to Sydney ’Varsity’s long honor-
roll. A few weeks ago he was awarded the Military
Cross for fine services with the Medical Brigade, and
the cheery news was still warm when the last word
came through. Both with Scots’ College and ’Var-
sity, Aspinall had been a very fine Rugby Union
player and cricketer.
Herbert J. Tye reckoned it was up to him
when he won the Botany (Sydney) three-mile road
race (70sec. start) from champion H. Hayden
(scratch) on Saturday. Half a dozen previous starts
this season had earned three seconds and three
thirds. Years ago Charlie Wevman (Botany) had
a monopoly of places in championships and all man-
ner of athletic events; and Tye appears -to have
caught the club infection. Two more firsts would
give him about a full hand.
“Khaki”: My entry for the Coincidence
Stakes. Two motor-bikes collided on the Barrington-
road, near Latrobe (Tas.), recently, with fatal
results for one rider and a big hospital-bill for the
other. The numbers of the smashed machines were
consecutive, 5888 and 5889.

motor-cycle was a casual and uncertain conundrum,
and its reliability or otherwise was a matter for
proof.; but now it is a thoroughly tested machine,
and it is obviously unnecessary for dozens of dare-
devils to cavort around the country demonstrating
what everyone knows. While no useful purpose is
served, a good deal of inconvenience and danger to
other road users is occasioned, and a large ciuantitv
m motor spirit, lubricating oil, etc., is needlesslv
dissipated.

usually a ring of small stones or pebbles, where the
spawn is deposited in season, and where the fish
“sleeps” a good deal during the day. Where stones
are scarce the fish shoves or rolls pebbles along
with its mouth to the desired spot. The residence
is circular or oval in shape, made near shore, prefer-
ably on a sandy bottom. The male catfish hovers
about the nursery, not from any high paternal in-
stinct, but with the object of making a meal of the
young ones; and the mother is most of her time kept
busy protecting her progeny from his murderous
onslaughts and from the attacks of other cannibals.
“Enrobso” : To the man on the end of a
bream line who knows his job, George's River
(N.S.W.) is an Eldorado. One night recently 11
boats put to sea, and my pal alone tallied 34. The
following evening a stiff southerly was blowing, and
the total catch for two boatloads was three. The old
heads maintain that under such weather conditions
the fish take a night off. What are the reasons?
It takes two tides after a southerly before the
business-as-usual sign is hoisted. Incidentally, I
know a bream angler with the right “touch” who
uses oysters for burley. It’s expensive, but that’s a
detail.
The red rock-cod has an obscure (apd
useless) relative known as the fortescue fish, which
all fishermen avoid. It is highly poisonous, and a
wound from the spines causes great pain and swell-
ing. The nuisance is fairly common on weedy
grounds in tidal lakes, harbors and estuaries, and
is apt to be trodden upon by waders. Although not
so severe, a prick from the formidable spines of the
fortescue’s handsome pink brother will ache for
hours. When first hauled out of the water, a
grotesque reddish-pink hump, the red rock-cod gives
one the impression of a crayfish which has somehow
survived the boiling process and got back into the
sea. Fair-sized specimens have been caught off
Balmoral Beach with a rising tide, and, considering
their weight, the arrested pulled like horses; but it
is the slow, strong pull of the groper, not the
tugging, rushing fight put up by snapper.


To Have a Knowledge
of Boxing
should be the aim of every man. In the hour of need such a knowledge
proves one’s greatest friend. Are you able to take your own part —
to defend yourself against the attacks of rough arid aggressive men ?
A scientific knowledge of boxing will enable you to deliver a sound
punishment to any inexperienced bully who may cross your path—to
assert your manliness in the hour of need.
1 TEACH BOXING BY POST
-—teach it in a thorough, scientific and practical man-
ner. Now don't get the idea that I teach you only
the theory, because that’s not so. Under my guid-
ance you will learn how to make all the “hits,”
“stops,” and “moves” of the world’s most scientific
boxers.
You’ve no excuse for remaining crude and inexperi-
enced, a good target for the first bully who torments
you. Let me make you a cool, determined, scientific
boxer, with a substantial punch and effective guard—
a manly man, well able to look after yourself and
win the respect of others.
What a delightful pastime you’ll find my tuition!
What a valuable exercise for body and brain !

Don’t Have Grey Hair.
A simple, old-fashioned, home-made recipe will
make the greyness disappear.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap to
both men and women while still in the prime
of life. Hair dyes are not advisable because
they are always obvious, inconvenient and
often downright injurious. Few people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily
made up at home, will turn the hair back to
a natural color in a perfectly harmless
manner. You have only to get two ounces
of tammalite concentrate from your chemist
and mix it with three ounces of bay rum to
prove this. Apply this simple and harmless
lotion for a few nights to the hair with a
small sponge and the greyness will gradually
disappear. The lotion is neither sticky nor
greasy, and has been proved over and over
again for generations past bv those in posses-
sion of the formula. —Advt.

Total Reserves. . £599,929
Less Loan flotations, etc. 27,097
Net Reserves £572,832
You can’t, however, say that this energetic
department has made thus far a profit
of £572,532, seeing that so large a propor-
tion of the total is a provision for repairs
and renewals of plant which has been more
or less worn out in producing the revenue.
The position really is that the department
has
(1) Paid interest on all borrowed money;
(2) Paid for repairs and renewals to date;
(3) Bought out and paid for private competing
undertakings at a cost of £140,375;
(4) Put by £115,584 towards the repayment of
capital ( £1,954,500) ; and
(5) Made £457,248 towards counterbalancing the
depreciation of plant through wear and tear.
The annual contribution to the depreciation
fund was, by resolution of the Council in
1909, fixed at 3 p.c. of the capital expendi-
ture as at June 30 of each year; but this
was liberalised last year, and the contribu-
tion is now 3 p.c. of the expenditure as at
December 31. Whether 3 p.c. is sufficient is
doubtful; but there is a special renewals
reserve as well and a handy P. and L.
balance. On the whole, it may be safely
assumed that depreciation is very well pro-
vided for one way and another. These re-
serves are not, however, invested in realis-
able securities, as some at least of them
ought to be, and as the sinking fund is. The
result is that loan issues are not as large as
they would otherwise have* to be; on the
other hand, when renewals have to be made,
there will probably have to be issues to pay
for them.
The next table shows the growth of the
business in some other respects:—

1916.. 433,996 211,263 222,733 89,938 132,795
The profit exhibited there is irrespective of
various deductions (sinking fund, etc.). As
the revenue increased it might reasonably
have been expected that the proportion of
working exes. would have materially
decreased. There certainly has been a smail
reduction —from 54 p.c. of the revenue in
1910 to 49 p.c. last year. Better figures
would, however, have been shown but for the
war. “Military allowances,” for instance,
last year ran to no less than £10,620; and
fuel and other items have also upset many
calculations. Still, the year showed a sur-
plus sufficient to provide the sinking fund
and the 3 p.c. depreciation or renewal allow-
ance, and leave £32,000 over for contingen-
cies.

In its eagerness to encourage mining, the
Westralian Government has agreed to certain
concessions and is considering others. It has
already sanctioned; (1) Free crushing at
the State mills of trial parcels up to 25 tons
of ore taken from virgin ground; (2) liberal
reductions in battery, smelting and assay
charges; (3) special rebate on treatment
costs where the average recovery is under
lOdwt. of gold per ton. Those which it is
thinking over are: (1) Increase in prospect-
ing areas from 18 acres to 24 acres, and to
allow one man to work 12 acres and two
men 24 acres, instead of requiring one for
nine acres and two for 18 as at present;
(2) a rental of 2s. 6d. per acre for
the first three years, as against the
present charge of ss. per acre the
first year and 20s. per acre thereafter;
(3) more liberal exemption, particularly in
cases where the bulk of the expenditure has
been on development; (4) making larger
areas available for sluicing and puddling;
(5) greater Government attention to boring]
geological survey and scientific research.
Prospecting for coal and oil is also under-
lined as a very necessary and important
piece of work.

BEAUTY SECRETS
REVEALED.
By “MIMOSA/
Munnnii;
HAIR CULTURE.
A DISTRESSING lack of hair will mar
the most beautiful face, and after all
there is really no need to have poor or
impoverished hair if a few commonsense
rules are observed. First of all, hair tonics
must be freshly-made in order to obtain the
best results, and thousands of women, and
men, too, are now making up their own
lotions with most satisfactory results. For
this purpose they obtain from the chemist’s
one ounce of boranium and mix this with
i pint of bay rum, quite a simple formula,
and according to all accounts remarkably
effective. This simple home-made lotion
quickly removes all dandruff, and creates a
growth of new, healthy hair which will
gladden the heart of any woman. One word
in conclusion. Do not experiment with
your hair, long suffering though it may be.
Nature will surely revolt if you continue
to subject the hair and scalp to all kinds
of fanciful treatments. Employ a tonic by
all means if such is required, but having
found a satisfactory one use no other.
GOOD SHAMPOO IMPORTANT.
THE hair should be allowed to breathe,
and the greasy film around each strand
must be removed wdth a mild non-
alkaline shampoo. Soaps should be tabooed.
The vfery best solution for the purpose can
be made by dissolving a teaspoonful of stal-
lax granules in a cup of hot water. It
stimulates the scalp to healthy action, and
at the same time leaves the hair in that
soft, fluffy condition so much admired. Any
chemist can supply you with an original
packet of stallax, sufficient to make twenty-
five or thirty shampoos.
MAGIC FOR SUPERFLUOUS HAIR.
IT is astounding the number of women
who suffer from unsightly growths of
hair on the face, and it will come as a
piece of good news to know that there is a
simple substance, known as powdered phe-
minol, w r hich will remove it immediately
and permanently. Mix a small quantity
into a thin paste with a little water, and
apply to the objectional growths. In two
minutes all trace of the hair will have
entirely vanished, and your skin wfill be as
soft and smooth as a child’s.
RENEWING COMPLEXIONS.
usually
THE average woman of to-day i s
satisfied if her complexion is
Pretty, little knowing that an e k
skin is now within her reach, nrovidin
has the good sense to stop using chean S 1' e
up preparations and adopt what h fl « ,
become known as the mercolised-wax J
It is a pity that every woman in the
cannot be apprised of this simple met M
Phe few to whom its virtues are “S
known have complexions that are the
of all their friends, and, as is usu i llv7/
case, the majority of them refuse to dLi
the secret. However, the formula has
been verified, and is known as meicolhed
wax. Inquiry at several chemists’ E
have resulted in ascertaining that this T
stance has been known to the select fen- f b
some years as a complexion beautifier Lp
is only until quite recently that it hsU hi
used to any extent for this purpose. ItE
also explained how mercolised wax renew
the complexion, but as this is rather til
meal it is not proposed to repeat it here li
will be sufficient to say that through son!
peculiar action the wax absorbs the dead
and discolored outer cuticle, revealing £
fresh young complexion which every woman
has underneath. The process occupies ah™
ten days, and the change is so gradual a 7
imperceptible that no discomfort whatever
is caused. The treatment is perfectly harm-
iess < and the wax may be used as often a*
desired. dS

right off on the towel. Also the large oilv
pores immediately close up and efface them,
selves naturally. The greasiness disappears
and the skin is left smooth, soft and cool,
This simple treatment is then repeated a few
times at intervals of four or five days to
ensure the permanence of the result. [i

“Six and Eight”: That Adelaide suburban
fire brigade which is alleged to have lately
paid small boys to light fires for it to put
out is reminiscent of one in a X. S. Wales
Western town. A musical society which had
obtained an unsecured overdraft from a local
bank decided to hold a concert to pay the
debt. The nights of the Agricultural Show
days were chosen, the idea being that
strangers would “bleed” more freely than
locals. The Show people, beside their daily
exhibition of pigs and pumpkins, ran variety
entertainments of a pretty purple brand. The
musicians’ first-night receipts panned out
nearly enough to pay all expenses, and they
were jubilant over the prospect of the last
night’s takings being sufficient to draw the
banker’s fangs. But just as the concert hall
commenced to fill, the firebell rang, and the
engine, drawn by galloping horses and with
the firemen on it yelling “The Show Ground !
The Show Ground!” dashed past. That
settled the concert; the street crowd streamed
after the engine and even the early coneert-
eers rushed out of the hall. But unfortunately
the show-ground caretaker had forgotten to
light the heap of straw which was to furnish
the brigade’s excuse for the diversion ! Then
the yells of indebted musicians for the scalps
of the brigade’s captain and the show-secre-
tary almost drowned the howls of the unfor-
tunate bank-manager living in terror of head
office. Acting on the principle of letting the
tail go with the hide, he had allowed the
accursed overdraft to be slightly increased to
cover initial expenses.

In moving the adoption of the Report the Chairman (Mr. Wm. Dixson) said: —■
The war has almost completed its third year, and is still being waged with unfailing determination.
Its economic effects in diverting national energies into fresh channels, and interfering with the
normal course of trade, are each month being more widely felt. _ , .
Our distance from markets accentuates our difficulties, and the transportation of Australian wool,
wheat meat and other produce presents problems of the most serious character.
Having these troubles in mind, your Directors determined upon a cautious policy, and resolved to
strengthen the Rank’s position. i . . ,
In carrying out this police, we were prepared for a reduction in our profits from the standard ot
tin* nrevious half-vear, but bv careful management, aided by favorable exchange operations, our profits
have been maintained at a high level, and we have been able again to carry £5OOO to the Reserve
Fund and £lOOO to Bank Premises Account, besides placing a large sum to Contingency Account.
We feel sure that you will approve our determination not to increase the dividend while abnormal
conditionsaContmue. of the Balance-sheet with those of the 30th June last year:
At June 30, 1916, Deposits were £2,142,331.
At June 30, 1917, Deposits were £2,164,670. . , , . ,
Our figures have been maintained, although large contributions have been made by our customers to
the last Commonwealth War Loan. The Bank itself applied for £65,000.

Pure Wool Underwear
Wolsev Underwear is a safe investment—and one that ensures
safety.
Wolsev is safe, because it is pure wool —because it never shrinks,
and is absolutely dependable.
Wolsey ensures safety —it guards the body against the vagaries of
the weather—ensures victory against its treacheries, its chills and
ills.
Wolsev-is British —made by British workers in British factories,
under a British directorate. The underwear for patriotic
Australian men and women.
Guaranteed unshrinkable. Made not only for men and
women, but children too. Look for the Wolsey trade-mark
on every garment. Owing to the enormous demands for
underwear for our soldiers and sailors, delay in the supply
of Wolsey is sometimes unavoidable —in such cases we ask
the indulgence of our friends.

IN BANANA LAND
“R.P.”: Re the Grafton (N.S.W.) Bill-
jim (B. 19/7/T7) who renounced his mili-
tary pension when he discovered that his
new civil job would keep him going without
outside assistance. There’s another patriot
from Mount Morgan. He lost an eye at
Gallipoli and was invalided home. But the
call was too strong for him. Time after
time he was turned down for re-enlistment.
Now he is on his way to Blighty at his own
expense (he is a working lad), and if he
cannot get amongst his old pals in the
trenches he intends helping to manufacture
ironmongery for them to throw at Fritz.
“De C.”: The Ryan Government has not
abandoned its fight with the Leg. Couhcil.
The Ministry is pushing on with the Initia-
tive and Referendum Bill, and when that
measure comes to be rejected in “another
place,” the fun will begin. The filling of
about seven existing vacancies would bring
the nominee House up to its normal number
of just over 40; but, as the dominant party
now has but three proclaimed sympathisers
in the Council, a new precedent would have
to be established to insure a Ministerial
majority. It is argued that no clear consti-
tutional obstacle lies in the way of increas-
ing the mefnbership of the House of Last
Say ; and the Governor’s Speech of a month
ago announced an intention “to take such
steps as will prevent the Leg. Council from
rejecting or materially altering measures
which the elected representatives of the
people have approved.”
“Dryberra”: J. J. McGinley. M.A., LL.B..
recently promoted in the Justice Depart-
ment. in addition to being a gent, one is
also an authorised surveyor and mining
manager. After a spell at the latter jobs he
went back to law. and is earning quick pro-
motion at the above address. Solicitors who
have deserted Costs for a theodolite are rare,
but there are plenty of precedents for sur-
veyors who feel like six-and-eightpenee. Jus-
tice Cussen is a Vic. case in point; and
Pike, who has a big practice in the N. S.
Wales Land Appeal Court, is another.
Joseph Hargreaves, of Ipswich (Q.), is
practising both as barrister and surveyor.
Costs take most of his time at present; still,
he is one of the foremost men in the other
profession and a member of the Surveyors’
Board.
Passed out a few days ago G. T. Bell,
auctioneer, one of Queensland's best-known
men. Victorian-born, he came to Queens-
land young, and fell early into a congenial
line. ‘ He was one of Bundaberg’s earliest
settlers—’way back in the early ’7o’s—and
from there he drifted to Brisbane. A big
flood ruined him, and drove him over to
Kalgoorlie; but the call of Bananaland was
too strong, and he got back eventually. The
genial, generous fellow was “a bit literary,”
too, and autobiographed himself in a little
book, “Going, Going—Gone.”
“Kirribilli”: “Barcoo’s” statement (B.
2G/7/T7) that station-owners are at last
protecting crows reminds nxAof a recent inci-
dent in the Kingaroy district. A lad brought
18 crow scalps to the shire clerk and claimed
the reward for destroying the “pests.” Asked
how he caught them, he explained that when
FRENCH ROUSH.
THE VETERAN ( just back- from trenches, meeting new arrival): “Hullo, beautiful one!
Fancy you here! Rut how did you manage to pass the doctor with that horrible
deformity at the back of your nose?”
BEAUTIFUL ONE: “ Garn , watcher mean?”
THE VETERAN: “Face!”
ploughing he had noticed that crows imme-
diately pounced on the mice he turned up.
The youthful Bananalander thereupon
secured a number of mice, slit them, placed
phosphorus inside the carcases and laid the
baits. Result —18 dead crows, and Heaven
knows how many extra mice to destroy the
wheat.
The most shocking example of the deadly
influence of the Northern climate is provided
by the case of Hugh Campbell, of Ipswich,
whd departed this life a few days ago.
Hughie struck Port Jackson in 1838, and
made straightway north to commit suicide
and, incidentally, help open up the newly-
discovered Darling Downs. Blaeksmithing
at Ipswich occupied the sturdy Scot in his
early years in Bananaland, and he liked the
job so much that he kept it up till he was
82. Twelve children survive, one of whom
is J. M. Campbell, of the Agent-General’s
office, London. For 75 years he wrestled
with the tropical inclemencies of the
Bremer district, and finally gave it up when
on the verge of 89.
Her Hands.
[FOR THE BULLIN.]
I sing her long hands. Life had made
Her grey eyes tired before I came,
And in her veins had died the flame
For want of fuel. She had prayed
So much for love that she at last
Had closed sick lids, till he was past.
I sing her hands, for though she tried
To seal her soul to toil alone
And swore her days to hope foregone,
Because of that which was denied,
Her hands, somehow, remain the same
As when they stretched on summer nights
Towards the dance of pixie-lights,
And dreamed they were a constant flame.
Pointed her little finger is;
Her hollow palm, the dainty tips,
Seem hungering for a lover’s lips
As they curve inwards to a kiss.
One thin gold ring—/ did not place—•
Guards her first finger like a shield,
And yet her whole hand cries “I yield !’*
Although “I conquer!” cries the face!
Her grey eyes look so hard at me,
And they condemn as there they look.
They read me like a blotted book.
Her gentle hands, forgivingly,
Unseen by her, my fingers clasp ;
Her eyes and lips are armored bright;
Her woman hands, so fine and white,
Lie warm and naked in my grasp.
She keeps her bosom cold and proud,
Her outraged spirit there to prove
In her hands lurks a living love,
Although her lips have spun his shroud!
I sing her hands! If her eyes turn
To some chaste dream she keeps apart,
Her throbbing fingers hold a heart
That all chaste dreams to ash would burn!
Aloof from mine the chill soul stands;
I only sing the earth-warm hands!

Brisbane, August 4, 1917.
My Dear Tiiargomindah. —
Another little fill-in-time job has been
found for our imported Governor, and,
reallv, a lot of people will take an interest
in this one. His Ex. is to put his shoulder
to the kev and open the long-delayed Resi-
dential Club for Returned boldiers and
Sailors on Saturday night. There are no
invitations. Admission is by silier coin-
which shows the awful slump there is in
figureheads these days! Donations in the
form of furniture and cash are rolling in
to the club, and it ought to start out a
lusty juvenile.
Some men are never satisfied. One of
them is a Jap who was in the service ot
Judge Shand at Townsville until a few days
ago, when he was sacked. _ You, my dear,
with your experience of rings of strikers,
might' think that the boy would be pleased.
But lie was not; he leaped upon his Honor,
threw him and banged his head on the floor.
His Honor is now in dock and our ally is
awaiting trial.
Mr. A. Amies, Queensland manager of
the A.M.P.. is to leave shortly for Maori-
land. The staff farewelled him on Wednes-
day. Mr. F. Mcßryde, of Adelaide, will fill
the vacant chair.
Of the three Reilly boys, of Rangeville.
who hurried into camp when the bugles first
blew, Thomas was killed in France on
July 10 and James and William (the former
badly wounded) are both prisoners in Ger-
many.
Arnold Power, son of the John Powers, of
South Brisbane, won a Military Medal with
the Field Ambulance at Bullecourt.
Capt. Tom Macleod, of the R.F.C.. was
gladdened, before being invalided home, by
a presentation from the few officers left of
those who were with his squadron when he
joined it- “To Mac, from his comrades of
‘ Squadron.” He confesses that he
appreciated that even more than his pre-
\ lously-aoquired Croix do Guerre. Three
decorations have so far gone to the nine
members of the Q.Y.F.C. who went to Eng-
land to join the R.F.C.

Doyle had won an M.C. This week Dr. and

transferred from the A.I.F. to the FlviJ
Corps. Two brothers are still helping to
make life unpleasant for Fritz.
Recent promotion of Lieut. Hovemi™
Ilely, of the Q.F.A., to the rank of capto
stirs memories of the early days of Aus
tralian settlement. F. A. Hely, great-mwl
father of the 21-year-old officer, came from
Ireland early in the last century as Chief of
the Penal Establishments of N. S. Wales
and died in 1835 at Gosford. The grand-
father of the lad was the late Hovenden
Hely. pioneer squatter, explorer and member
of the first three Parliaments elected under
Responsible Government in N. S. Wales.

THE woman who tries Bostock shoes for the first
time realises, as soon as her foot slides home,
that here is something different, something
easier and more flexible, than anything she
lias yet dreamed of. Then, when she steps out in
them, what an exultant feeling she has of lightness,
buoyancy and freedom. On the top of this, too, there
is that delightful confidence and assurance that come
of being well-dressed and knowing it. For Bostock
shoes are always designed with one eye on the
fashions of the day and one eye on the ultimate sat-
isfaction of the wearer. The result is shoes so well
fitting and so easy, that they feel just like one’s best-
loved old pair, yet so dainty, so original, so
thoroughly well-made that they look and, after quite
i lot of wear, continue to look the newest and smart-
est things imaginable.

5 Primrose Buildings, 255« George St., Sydney.
A veteran of the last Maori War, G. 11.
Sparkes, passed out lately at Haberfield
(N.S.W.), aged 74. He was in the 18th
Royal Irish, and bought his discharge when
the regiment came to Sydney on the way
home. For 2ti years he sat in the Camper-
down Municipal Council; but he couldn’t get
past that into the Legislative Assembly,
though he tried often enough.
Of the new season’s crop of Labor League
office-bearers in Vie. only four out of 22 are
parliamentarians. They are all the newest
hands, too, the old seat-holders being pre-
sumably too tired to bother about directing
the movement from within. It is easier just
to take orders. Daniel McNamara, who
lately became a Leg. Councillor, after being
assistant-sec. at P.L.C. headquarters for
some years, is the newest of the bunch. The
others are Senator Barnes and Maurice
Blackburn and Edmund Hogan, M’s.L.A.
The Anglican gaiters at Gippsland, emp-
tied by the resignation of Bishop Pain, are
to go to W. C. Sadlier, who wears similar
•puttees at Nelson (M.L.). Sadlier was born
50 years ago in County Cork, at Bandon- —
the place whose bells “Father Prout”
Mahony sang about —where his father dab-
bled in ink. He came to Victoria as a boy,
and lived there till he got his Maoriland
apron, five years ago. Sadlier is one of five
students under Alex. Leeper. at Trinity Col-
lege, who have become Anglican bishops, the
others being Armstrong (Wangaratta),
Green (late of Ballarat), Stretch (New-
castle) and Long (Bathurst). He used to
be a curate in Bendigo, and afterwards
became a canon of Melbourne Cathedral.
Died at the age of 92, as the result of an
argument with a tram, Sydney Gibbons,
analyst, of Faraday House, East Melbourne.
This dignified old hoy. who looked like a chap-
lain from the pages of one of Besant and
Rice’s novels, was, active to the last, and
was walking into the city when the car of
fate overtook him. Arriving in the early
’forties, he was one of those who agreed on
Ballaarat (with the old spelling of two
“a’s”) as the name of the goldfield where he
toiled. Later he created a sensation by in-
denting a microscope valued at £lOO from
England, but it went down in a wreck, and
lie imported an even more costly one. In
the ’fifties he edited a monthly. The Journal
of Australia, and he was once connected,
many years ago, with the Herald.
“Norseman” : How these historians do get
their limbs dragged ! Taylor’s “Geography
Book of N. S. Wales” (Edition, 1912; page
100) states that in the big 1870 flood a
steamer sailed out of the Darling River
into the Paroo and got as far as the Queens-
land border! To do that trip the craft
would need to pass some big stations and
the towns of Wanaaring and Hungerford,
but I haven’t yet come across anybody there
who saw her on the way.
“P.W.” : Just inside the door of each room
of the refractory ward is a bell-pull which
rings an alarm at the hospital entrance
about 100 yards away. If a patient gets
over the odds the nurse rings the bell, and
any of the staff within hearing rush to the
nurses’ assistance. When Bill Bluegum was
convalescing after his city d.t.’s, his sister
called to see him, looking hot and tired.
“Would you care for a cup of tea?” asked
Bill. “Yes, I would, very much.” “Well,”
said Bill, “just ring the bell.” She gave it
a hearty tug, and in about lOsec. there
arrived, at full gallop, the yardsman, a
lightweight, with a piece of buttered toast in
his hand, another lightweight with his face
lathered, and a young doctor carrying a
heavy screwdriver. The matron finished a
close fourth, a good performance, as she
carried full weight for age. Nurses, doctors
and messengers were among the also-rans,
the last to finish being a lame carpenter. I
forget what happened when the poor girl
explained that she had only rung for tea.
“Te Babarantiko”: The Indian immigrant
in Fiji thrives amazingly in the new land.
He clings tenaciously to his own mode of
life, and there is only one native Fijian cus-
tom that he has taken kindly to. This is
the drinking of kava, to which brew the man
from Hind has dedicated himself whole-
heartedly. The white storekeepers, recognis-
ing Gunga Dliin’s weakness, cater for it, and
for Indian customers’ convenience every
store-verandah has its grinding mill, usually
a corncracker and grinder combined, crush-
ing the spicy root ready for admixture with
water. On these verandahs Indians squat,
drinking and talking the livelong day. De-
spite its high price—it is retailed at 4s. per
lb. —and its easy cultivation, not very much
kava root is grown locally, even by the
Fijians. Those ‘aristocrats prefer to buy
their supplies at the store.
“N.T.” : Nowadays there is supposed to be
a methodical inspection of restaurant-kit-
chens in Melbourne. Once in a great while
some city food-bedeviller is dragged protest-
ing to court for having his cupboards fes-
tooned with drippings of ancient fat. and for
storing the day’s supply of beefsteak among
the soup-bones of last Saturday week, and
he is fined. Then one wonders what the in-
spectors were doing while the fat and bones
were accumulating. Still, apart from such
proofs of a low habit of mind among
restaurateurs, there are plenty of odd tricks
which can’t very well be checked by in-
spectors. One eatery has its meat delivered
per ladder to a loft, and every day. draped
with an array of assorted flesh, the butcher’s
lad swings up to the top rung carrying an
extra few pounds of steak or other flapping
red meat by his teeth! He thinks it is a
humorous turn. One outfit feeds its rather-
particular customers in a rich, dim atmo-
sphere of shaded electrics. The lighting-
economy covers whatever dirt there is in
front; but at the back the fierce working
glare tells a fearful tale. It is here that
they pluck, draw (what a polite word “draw”
is!) and truss their fowls beside the ice-
cream pot; employ a catarrhal nigger at
oyster-opening beside the sink; and in the
fly-season prepare the strawberry-portions at
10 o’clock each morning, arranging them in
a handy position for the rush—and the flies.
I never did fancy fancy-cakes; but I began
to fancy them still less when, at this estab-
lishment, I saw a young lady-help bitterly
sneezing each cake off a tray on to its
appointed cake-dish.

Kiddies all love Granny Chamberlain —yes, and they love
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy too, and no persuasion is ever needed to get them to take
it. This means a lot to mothers. But aside from this it is perfectly harmless and can be
given with safety to the youngest and most delicate child. Since
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy
is the only cough medicine sold in Austral-
asia that has been officially declared free
from all narcotics I think it is every mother’s
duty to give this medicine to her children.
It contains no alcohol, opium, chloroform,
morphine or any other narcotic and you not
only have the manufacturers’ assurance of
this but the wrapper around each bottle bears
the Government Analysis showing that it has
been officially declared free from all narcotics.
Thousands of other mothers, as well as
myself, have proven that there is no better
medicine for children than Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy and you will all do well to
bear this in mind when YOUR children
have coughs and colds.

DID YOU KNOW
That the manufacturers of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, which is the
largest selling and most successful medicine of its kind in the world, also
make CHAMBIJRRAIN’STABIyISTSfor the Stomach and River? Chamberlain’s
Tablets are a new and improved remedy for Biliousness and Disorders of the Stomach, Diver and Bowels ; they have met
with the greatest success in the treatment of Constipation, Biliousness, Sick Headache, Impaired Digestion* and Liver
Disorders. Chamberlain’s Tablets not only move the bowels but improve the appetite and correct disorders of the stomach
and liver. Where Chamberlain s Tablets have been used they are a most popular medicine and everyone who has used them
is pleased with the prompt relief they afford. THEY ARE BETTER THAN PILLS and you would never wish to take another
dose of pills after having used Chamberlain’s Tablets ; they are easier and more pleasant to take, more mild and gentle in
their action and more reliable, as they can always be depended upon. Chamberlain’s Tablets cleanse and invigorate the
stomach and leave the bowels in a natural condition, while pills are more harsh in effect and their use is often followed
by constipation. They are sold by all chemists and storekeepers throughout the Commonwealth at Is. 6d. per bcx.
RAMESES
The Underwear for Good Service
BETWEEN “Kameses” the Pharaoh of three thousand years ago and “Rameses” the
underwear of to-day there is at least this in common: each in separate sphere
stands supreme.
But “Rameses” Underwear enjoys a vaster popularity than ever its pompous name-
sake knew; as a matter of fact, it has proved a. deal more useful!
With the price of the best woollen underwear soaring far beyond the reach of most of
us, who indeed would not appreciate the comfort, the satisfaction, and the extreme
moderateness of cost that “Rameses” offers?
Of course, “Rameses” is British, and “Rameses,” being made from specially selected,
sound, durable yarn, will give fine service both in wash and wear.
Next to the “absolute best” in
underwear —which means a
frightening price—comes “Ra-
meses” at a price within the
means of all, a price at which
you cannot duplicate its ex-
cellence however and wherever
you may search, a price which
has previously meant the buy-
ing of inferior German goods.
( Trade mark)
“Rameses” British Undergar-
ments are MADE to their full
size (not stretched thereto),
they have flattened seams, and
are soft, elastic, cosy and pro-
tective; every detail has been
carefully studied. Ask for
“Rameses” Underwear if com-
fort, economy, value and patriot-
ism weigh with you.
There is a wide range of “Raineses” Garments for. men and women, every genuine
garment bears the “Rameses” Trade Mark, and every garment is unshrinkable.
“RAMESES” WILL PLEASE YOU. Insist on “Rameses” next time you buy.

THE BLOOD is the energiser of the system. Upon its quality
depends the nourishment of every organ, every nerve-centre,
every muscle of the body.
Poorness of Blood is called Antemia —girls, women and men
are all subject to it.
It manifests itself in breathlessness on slight exertion, pale
cheeks, lustreless eyes, depression and exhaustion.
If you have any of these symptoms, or are run-down and need
a tonic, take Iron ‘Jelloids’ to enrich the blood.
When the blood has been enriched and strengthened, Anaemia
is overcome —-the symptoms give place to abundant vitality, rosy
cheeks, and a feeling of general “fitness" and well-being.
Dr. Andrew Wilson wrote :—“ 1 mbroverished blood can be made rich and good
“ by means of Iron ‘ Jelloidsthe most effective and desirable treatment."

From the Inverell (N.S.W.) Argus:—
The proprietor of the Inverell Argus desires to
extend his thanks to the members of the Inverell Fire
Brigade and all others who helped so readily and
splendidly in connection with Saturday morning’s
fire, by which the Argus office was destroyed.
When last heard of the brigade was sitting
on its reel scratching its poll with the
hydrant.
“French Rale” : With a sigh of relief —for
ho was of too kindly a temperament for the
job of literary butcher —Lieut.-Col. F. S.
Nowell lays down the censor’s blue pencil
and resumes his lawyer’s job in Castlemaine
(Vic.). Under Lieut.-Col. McColl, whose red
gorget patches threw his pointed white beard
into such artistic relief, Newell did most of
the work in Melbourne, and showed some
appreciation of the difficulties of hurried
pressmen when Hughes was on the rampage.
Newell, a partner of Bob Best (who also has
a son-in-law with Gallipoli service in the
censor’s office), is succeeded by Lieut.-Col.
J. F. Humphris. whose work in the S’African
war won him a medal and the D.S.O. He is
a tanned, black-moustached soldier, who did
well as camp commandant on both sides of
the Murray—a good Australian who knows
much more about the manufacture of tomato
sauce than the production of newspapers.
“Benno”: The failure of The Bulletin
to get to the Front in sufficient numbers (B.
19/7/T7) is due to loose organisation on
the other side. Here’s an instance. At
Ma’adi (Egypt) a great bonfire commenced
just after tucker-time,, and the boys, scent-
ing fun, gathered around. Amazed—and
then lurid—language followed when it was
discovered that the fuel consisted of about
half a ton of current Australian journals—
mostly Bulletins. One bundle was promptly
rescued from the flare. The O.C. was quickly
hunted down, and the trouble placed before
him. He unsympathetically answered that,
“owing to the extraordinary congestion of
ordinary mail-matter (letters), there was no
time to distribute newspapers.” The rescued
bundle was next handed to him that it might
have a softening effect. He took it and
looked hard. “Goodness!” he ejaculated.
“It’s for me.” The following fortnight we
had a grand picnic of papers; after that
there was the same old chronic scarcity.
There were no more bonfires, however. But
what we did notice was that native hawkers
began selling Bulletins at any price they
thought they could extract —up to six or
seven piastres (Is. 3d. to Is. 6d.) ! We
thought we could guess where they came
from.

ing the appointment as soon as he took

In the course of a press outcry in Mel-

NO REASON WHY.
[FOR THE BULLIN.]
There seems to be no reason why we shouldn’t run
the world
In a sweeter sort of way than this we know.
Every morning when the dawn swims up ’mid rosy
glows impearled
There’s an excellent commencement for the show.
Could we live up to the dawning, what a fine thing
life would be ,
As with comrades staunch along the road we go!
They tell me that we can’t, and that should be
enough for me....
There seems to be no reason, though !
There seems to be no reason why Boy Love should
clank in chains *
At the age when human boys get into pants; !
But these things are fixed by rule and rote, o’vj?
pleasures and our pains,
And we fret through life like automatic ants.
If love were free as hate is, how the world, would
lilt along,
And how our honeypots would overflow!
The moralists assure me that such sweetness would
be Wrong....
There seems to be no reason, though!
There seems to be no reason why each sex should live
at war
With the sex that most attracts it now and then.
There’s a lot of pain in living, and love is the- balm
therefor,
So why can’t women live like jaals with men?;
My reasoning may seem putrid to the casuist’s devious
mind:
I’m no theologian, of course ; but oh,
It is sad we can’t have everybody uniformly kind....
There seems to be no reason, though!
There seems to be no reason why I can’t have fifty
pounds
When I want it, just to grease the wheels a bit;
I’m a placid sort of fellow, with desires kept well
in bounds;
But the thing I want’s the thing I want —just it.
If I want to give five thousand to an orphanage for
girls,
Why shouldn’t I ? But bishops all arow
Say that here’s a new temptation of the chap whose
tail’s upeurled....
There seems to be no reason, though!
There seems to be no reason why I’m here, misunder-
stood,
Writing verses for The Bulletin’s hard cash :
And there’s certainly no reason why the unctuous
prosers should
Call these verses that I write immoral trash.
When I sing of legs and ladies, they declare that I
should write
Of ham and beef and virtue and the low
Distant hum of hymns sung sadly by thin damsels
robed in white....
There seems to be no reason, though!

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also

Mother’s Favorite.
Foolish mothers dose their babies with home-made concoctions or
something recommended by a neighbor, and perhaps upset the little
stomach and make the baby cross and uncomfortable by this mistaken
economy. Wise mothers do not experiment with untried nostrums, but
depend on a remedy which has been compiled from the scientific pre-
scription of a famous physician, and is designed to cure the cold without
upsetting the digestive organs. Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is this
remedy, and mothers may give it to their babies, secure in the know-
ledge that coughs and colds will no longer rack the little bodies.
Good for all the Family.
For Croup it has the most wonderful results. Whooping Cough is cut short
by the use of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery. For all the family ills resulting
from throat, chest or lung complaint, the mother’s resource is Dr. Sheldon’s New
Discovery.

[FOR THE BULLIN.]
battle of the dawn is lost and won,
I And madly the marauding glooms of
night
Gallop and scatter; and the conquering sun
Poises his glittering plane above their flight,
And sees the vermeil dawn-dust whirling by
Beneath his flashing cavalries of light,
And hears liis harbingers of triumph ringing
The carillons of sky ;
Hears, too, the minstrels of the morning
singing,
While earth arouses with a low, slow sigh.
And babbling birds and laughing waters
make
A tarantelle of carol everywhere.
And slumbering elfin odors rouse, and wake,
And toss their petalled quilts, and toss their
hair,
And bathe in iridescent pools of dew,
And ride the wings of some breeze-messenger
Along the paddocks of the grass and clover,
And past the hills of blue,
Beckoning every morning-tipsy rover
To ramble with the sun-god’s retinue.
His retinue of flowery-skirted song;
Of laughters dancing nude beneath the tree's ;
Of joys that giggle flapper-like along,
And dark-eyed absent-minded reveries ;
Of love that queens the pageant evermore,
And passion, drunk with life and ill at ease;
Of tomboy fantasies and red-lipped splendor;
While ever on before
The sprites of beauty sing a glad surrender
To that great-hearted sun-god they adore.
To that great god who signs his sovranty
In hieroglyph on tablets of the days—
In diamond-flash and forest-greenery
And black volcanoes roaring into blaze;
In regal robes of roses, and of skies;
In ghostly cities hung in desert-haze;
In avalanches loosened down a mountain,
And glancing dragon-flies;
The laughter-light that dances round a foun-
tain ;
The dancing light that laughs in children's
eyes.
And bird and beast and blossom every one,
Tangerine sunsets, and the rosy-brown
Limbs of a surfer lolling in the sun,
The pomp and purple of a puppet’s gown,
The green of emeralds and malachite.
The laughing moods of men and maids, the
frown
Of tempest-hearted jealousy that flashes
A dagger through the night,
And baby-croons and sudden thunder-crashes
Are songs and tokens of the sun-god’s might.
A god for whom the frankincense of morn
Floats from the rock-built altars of the hills;
At whose decrees are moths and meteors
born ;
Whose gesture is a gale of song that thrills
The pulses of the world ; whose leisured sigh
Flutters and fans the languour-light that fills
The wakening eyes of love; whose matin-
song
Saffrons the morning sky ;
Who takes the clear hosannas of a throng
Of planet-peoples as he thunders by.
A god-adventurer who dared to pace
The mountain-passes of eternity;
Who flamed adown the chasmy 'darks of
space,
And through the caves of night, to find and
free
The spirit of Life as languishing she lay
Lost in the voids ; who leads her wonderingly,
By lakes of sky and lily-fields of light,
And through the nights of gay
Butterfly-comets, to the distant bright
Temples and gardens of the Milky Way.
MAORILAND.
BARTLETT ADAMSON.
Cow.
[FOR THE BULLIN.]
BY elbowing through rows of tweed-
covered backs and bruising my feet
on boots smelling of stables, I reach
the Holy of Holies, where, partly sur-
rounded by outer courts full of troubled
cattle, the auction-sale is going forward.
It is hot under the iron roof of this sanc-
tum, and odorous of the cow. There-is a-
wooden gallery where, from its highest pin-
nacle, I gain a fine view. Below me at the
reax' is a big pen, where cows chew (he
cud blissfully unconcerned with the strife
and confusion a few feet away. These are
not for sale to-day. To-morrow, maybe.
Meanwhile sufficient unto the day is the
safety thereof.
There is a choking stench of stabling and
the most awful din —mooings, bellowings of
frightened cattle, pawings, hornings, stam-
pedes round the small pens; cows slipping to
their knees on the pitchers, being exhorted
to rise with lurid adjectives and whip-
crackings ; calves bellowing for breakfast;
dogs in barking convulsions. All this in the
pens adjacent, where youthful stockmen in
leather leggings and armed with whips and
wooden prods stand among the swirling
stock, their sole mission being apparently to
keep the cattle well-stirred, like a cook
mixing a pudding. And they do it. Not for
a moment does the dove of peace alight
among that tangle of swirling cow-tails. Nor
does the light of reason animate any bovine
eyeball. fear-distraught flashes, lather,
quivering hides; webs of frothy slime from
distended jaws which, floating on the air,
falls where it listeth, on me, on you—yea.
even on the auctioneer.
Now and then we have a circus turn. A
stockman perhaps, having twisted a tail past
its owner’s endurance, is dragged round the
pen at the end of- it, and while in transit
other cows puncture him with their horns.
The whole fraternity is bellowing, a chorus
of most heartrending quality being intoned
by calves mewed behind rails with hunger-
quickened scent for mother’s milk.
I cannot make head or tail of it, so turn
my attention to the auctioneer. Perhaps he
will supply the clue.
A long, lean man he is, sun-scorched quite
appropriately to the color of smoked cow. He
occupies a wooden rostrum; on either side in
rostrums of lesser state are his clerks.
Below him leans a gnome who chews with-
out ceasing; or possibly he is mumbling- in-
cantations. He carries a wand, tar-tipped,
which for replenishing he dips into a caul-
dron containing more tar.
The auctioneer has hard blue eyes. His
darting glance would ferret a bidder from
the very bowels of the market-place. No-
thing and nobody escapes them. His mouth
seems as though it had been shaped by a
cleaver; his, “You, sir,” or “Your bid,
Tom,” leaps from it and springs upon one
like teeth of an old-fashioned steel rat-trap.
It is really dangerous to look at him if you
are not wanting a cow r , because should your
inquisitive glance collide with the rapier-
thrust of his, he barks, “Thank you, sir,” or
“I get you, sir?” And he does, while you
get the cow, when perhaps all you could use
of her is a fillet steak.
Hear him? His recitative pours forth
irrespective of punctuation. As “Lot B,”
sold, is passed out by one gate another gate
opens and “Lot C” scrambles in.
“Oh, my word, here’s a nice lot! Four
snorting brindles. All young stuff, meaty.
What you think they’re worth—a tenner?
A tenner! Ten notes? Look at ’em, you
men from up the Murray. Wouldn’t you
like a thousand of ’em? And going at a
tenner! Take my tip, they’re the goods, and
offered at a tenner. Any advance? Thank
you, sir. Two six. Five bob? You’ll spring
another caser, sir, they’re worth it! And
two six”
He pauses and takes us all in. No one
caps the previous bid, so he drops to a
minor key. “And two six—another two six is
ten bob —it’s easier to get oil from an iron
bedstead than money from your pockets.
Look at ’em, you buyers—four snorting
brindles, going at ten-pun’-ten a head”
Without a pause he jerks his head at a
red-faced man in a dirty panama, and
barks: “The bid’s against you, Mr. Roths-
child. Better make an advance if you want
this stuff. Turn ’em round there, Jack!”
This to certain slaves of the ring armed with
wooden goads, who await incoming cattle
and share centre-stage with them, intent on
keeping the animals’ good points in view.
Jack and co. have been relaxing somewhat
—have been absently spitting at a certain
stone; but at the word of command they
wake to duty and poke and pommel the
brindles till these cavort and plunge almost
in the buyers’ faces.
The price, after this, advances till almost
another pound is added, and the auction-man
again takes up his parable. “An eleven’r?
An eleven’r-r-r ? Unbutton your pocket
another inch, Mr. Rothschild. I never saw
meatier stuff. And going at an cleven'r-r-r.
The bid’s against you, sir”
But Mr. Rothschild, who in reality is pro-
bably Mr. Smith and sees no reason for
hiding the fact, and who, moreover, is pro-
bably tired of the auctioneer’s humor, be-
comes cautious, fastens his pocket with a
double-lock and the brindles are hustled out
—some other man’s meat.
And now I sense the use of the tarmau.
At the conclusion of each sale he becomes
nimble, dips bis wand into the cauldron and
pursues the departing cattle with it, and.
catching them up at the exit, he “hoo-doos”
them by smearing symbolic marks across
their" flanks. There is too much tumult in
their going to let us judge for certain
whether this be a holy sign—something to
ward off foot-rot, maybe, or is it to do with
the Order of Freemasons?
’Tis but the twinkling of an eye since he
of the tarpot fouled the brindles, and already
another is being sold.
Quite another type of cow, this. A great,
scrawny bovine, almost the size of a ’bus.
Jack and co. hustle her forward with well-
directed prods and dully-resounding thwacks
of wooden weapons on bony promontories.
For looks, it is the kind of cow that stamps
one to a inash in a nightmare; yet the seller
admires it, claiming for it “condition,” affect-
ing never to have seen a finer beast.
“What have we got here?” lie barks.
There are rude interjections of “Sinews of
war” and “Bones,” “Send ’er to the boiling-
down works, Nosey—the abattoirs won’t
take ’er in.” But the auctioneer, evidently
known familiarly by the simple and lovable
name of “Nosey,” ignores these outbursts of
the ill-bred. He says the cow is “good,
weighty stuff” that would “cut up well.”
“Look at her mouth, yon buyers—and, mind
you, she’s been a good beast; that’s the sort
we breed up at Yarra flats—practically in-
destructible —live for ever! What you think
of her, Bill?” (to a prodder). “Ryebuek,”
answers Billy absently. lie is hanging on
to the “weighty stuff’s” tail, trying to turn
her round therewith, and only answers
through force of habit or because it is part
of his job.
The auctioneer takes the reply in the same
spirit. It is the usual dialogue, merely the
give-and-take of business routine. It is so
with all the stock —his estimates are high ;
according to his patter, all beyond price.
Every “Dolly” or “Kitty” gets a good send-
off, rarely starting at less than ten pounds.
Always he sees in “the goods” valuable
points. If not “weighty” then they have “the
makings of a good cow.” If too aged and
hollow for these adjectives they are “prime”
or have “breeding.” His “I never saw a
better,” if one supposed him genuine, would
cause wonder as to the world of famine and
drought he had passed his time in. If here
be yarded the flower of the bovine kingdom,
what has become of the weeds?
With familiarity I get the clue to the riot
in the outer pens. These all open one into
the other, and as sales progress every pen
moves up one, till the very liindermost
eventually enter the arena and face the
tribunal of Barter.
The interim is stormy, though, according
to cattle-handling standards, what appears
at first sight a needless chivvying of the
helpless is really a well-ordered “cutting-
out” process, the legginged stockmen being

flic cutters. With shoutings and whip-
crackings they disentangle a “springer” or a
brace of heifers from the scrum and press
them, with eyes ablaze, against the auction-
eer’s gate. Like indignant Peris, they gaze
into this—a paradise by comparison'.
Hardly has Lot 9 with the tarry man in
hot pursuit got bn the windy side of our
sense of smell when the smoking Peris assail
our nostrils. Never was such a scent of
cow. No wonder the man in the rostrum
leans over and draws long, long sniffs of
disinfecting fumes frbrn the cauldron of tar.
Mark his air of pleased surprise as some
“milkers” lumber heavily in. Undoubtedly
they are fine cattle even without his endorse-
ment. He starts one at sixteen notes. “I
won’t take a copper less —not a copper less
than sixteen quid, and giving her away. A
twenty-quart cow, isn’t she, Bill? Yes!
she’s a butter cow. Come on, you Murray
men, sixteen pounds—l won’t take a copper
less.”
“Fourteen,” bawls a buyer.
“Fourteen notes,” echoes the salesman,
abandoning his own estimate with the utmost
magnanimity—“a fourteener ! Mow’d you
expect the farmer to live? Turn her round,
boys—look at her bag, y<fu buyers. Bring a
bucket, Tom. Test her for yourselves.”
Slaves bring milk-buckets and prospective
buyers descend from the gallery and squat
low in the straw, intently watching experts
relieve the cow of her accumulations. The
auctioneer meanwhile languidly divests him-
self of his collar and tie, has a dry wash in
a towel, and inserts a jube into his voice-
box. He chats agreeably with his familiars
and passes round jokes with a head on them.
Samples of milk in tin vessels circulate.
Other samples meet one unexpectedly—in
the eye, maybe, squirted hither by ill-timed
movements of the cow. The air resounds
drowsily with cow fables, padded out by
milking records, and looking at the' life-
giving fluid in puddles on the pitchers and
percolating through the straw and manure
deposits, one understands how easy a thing
it should be to lure a cow farmer to strong
drink. By the time the tarman pursues the
dairy-cow with the secret sign, pretty well
everyone is anointed. There is unremoved
evidence of it on the lips of the thirsty.
Some of the milkers have “first” calves at
foot. I accept the statement in good faith,
though, for the most part, it meets with
derision—as many as four accouchements
being accredited to these “first mothers” by
the dairying cult present. There are times,
too, when the auctioneer pauses in the sell-
ing and assumes a detached air. speaking,
not as salesman, but as independent critic.
It is so when four heifers go at “a sixer.”
lle scratches his head with his collar and
dreamily surveys the frightened quartette.
“A pity,” he says. “A great pity! I
don’t like letting ’em go, Bill” (once more
the prodder is taken into his confidence).
“They’re worth eight notes apiece if they’re
worth a tram-ticket. What’s that?” to one
of the general public who would be faceti-
ous. “Why don’t I buy ’em myself?
Well, I would only I live in a flat, and I'd
have to stable ’em in the hat-rack.” He looks
disfressedly round, but his tactics are no
use. There’s no advance on the sixer. These
are dull fellows, lacking in enterprise.
“I don’t like it, gents—don’t like it at
all. Nice stuff —look at the shape of ’em.
Like a wedge. I ought to see the owner
before knocking them down. However”——
Ile shrugs and washes his hands of the
crime. “They’re yours, Brogan—a present
for a paltry twenty-four quid. Pass ’em
out, Bill.”
A small man with a round head and a
little hard hat atop now. appears amid the
stampeding stock in the pens. He is said to
own much of it. When the auctioneer’s hard
blue glance elicits no answering gleam from
the public eye and the sale halts on a tenner
he interrogates this cattle king.
“Will I pass her, Mr. Finn?” or “Does
she go at that?” he asks, and from under a
canopy of cow, or peering jovially between a
mesh of tails, Finn rejoins in a drawl; “Oh,
ya-as. Sell ’er, sell ’er. Do th’ best y’
ca-an. Ca’an't take ’em back t’ Dungalong
—th’ blanky roads is too blanky dry. Lorst
enough of ’em coinin’ daown —got smothered
in th’ dust.” Having confided in us he tips
the wink, and the salesman takes up the
parable again.
But Finn, who seems to have quite a
genius for chipping in, has more to say.
“There’s a blanky caow I got ’ere, though
—that Ayrshire be th’ fence —she- ain’t no
blanky scrubber. Nobuddy ’ll get ’er under
twenty-five notes.”
The audacity of this proposed raid on
buyers’ cheque-books rouses even the most
lethargic, and they keep watch out with
something akin to animation till in the
fulness of time a welter-weight bolts in.
She is monstrous large, is young, active,
vicious. Moreover she has been robbed of her
firstborn. Her proximity causes may loit-
erers on the pitchers to bestraddle the rails
and yank themselves out of harm’s way. The
tarry man alone remains unmoved.
“My word, here’s something worth waiting
for, buyers! That's what we breed at Dun-
galong station—all meat an’ milk. What
about the calf?” He pauses.
“Oh, yaas!” drawls Finn, in answer.
“She’s got a calf. Make a good milker this
time two years,” as, a crate being opened, a
spindly week-old comes out groggily and
makes a straight course for the milk supply.
“You see the goods, buyers. What you
think she’s worth? Eighteen notes? Eight-
een, I’m offered —-any advance on eighteen?
What's that? Want to see her month? Here,
someone wants to count Polly’s teeth.”
The good-natured owner volunteers to sat-
isfy the caviller.
“There y’ are, gents!” adds the salesman,
“absolutely no deception. Keep her forward,
boys. Hold back that calf, somebody. It
bellows like a foghorn. Give her tail a twist,
somebody.”
The sale is suspended. The auctioneer fits
another voice-jube into his face. The tarman
stirs up his cauldron. The cow,' suspecting
plots, lowers her head with rumbling admo-
nition to the red calf to sit tight. Immovable
she stands, centre-stage. At the back of my
brain the leaves of memory make h mournful
rustling. Where have I registered a scene
like this before?v Ah—Carmen! So had
stood the bull when Escamillo
But stay, is the toreador missing? No.
Toreador Finn, as to slow music, enters the
arena and approaches the cow, shouting no
defiant note, ’tis true —indeed, to be exact, he
is making ignoble duckings with tongue and
teeth, with intent to mollify the belligerent.
Sidling along like a thief in the night he
chants, “Thehk, thelik! Polly! Thclik,
thchk !” Helping hands put the calf over the
fence. They twist Polly’s tail and hang upon
her horns, forcing these extremities together
till the cow assumes the shape of a crescent
moon. Then the toreador, always stealthy,
runs an adroit arm along her convex side,
neckwards, mouthwards. He would show us
her teeth. There is a lurid glare in her eye.
She rumbles threats and rank mutiny.
Lest our breathing break the charm we
hold it. So does the toreador. He holds his
so tight, that his head swells like bottled
yeast and his tight little hat pops off like the
cork. It bounces over the fence and the calf
finds it toothsome.
Stealthy, stealthy does the trick, Bull-
fighter ! Toy witih Polly’s tail, slave of the
Prod! Get ready your symbol, Tarman !
Soon we shall count her teeth, and twenty,
twenty-five Commonwealth notes shall be
added to the cattle-king’s wad !
His fingers have slid down her nose and
into her slobbering jaws. He pulls open her
mouth with giant strength, showing her
molars. Silent, we take the count.
For a space they pose thus, cow and man,
like a group of statuary in a museum. It is
a great moment —intense, dramatic.
But there is always some malicious mind
ready for an anti-climax. Bill the Prodder
it is who gives Poll an undeserved thwack
across the rear. Quite naturally she lets
loose all her pent-up fury. She charges Bill
ahd his fellow-slaves, glares over the fence,
sees her calf just finishing the ribbon-band
of the toreador’s headgear, and takes a flying
leap to help finish it. And the toreador-
alas, poor hero! —is in the filth of the pit!
He takes the- merry gibes of the Murray
men lying down. Then, rising inopportunely,
he takes the magic symbol from the slave of
the wand who at the moment is in hot pur-
suit of the cow—a wreath of tar in lieu of
the conqueror's chaplet of laurel.
WEEROONA.

[FOR THE BULLIN.]
SHE had died—quietly, unostentatiously,
as she had lived. The soft round face,
and the silky brown hair, in death as
in life, gave the lie to the 30 years that the
birth certificate claimed for her.
The two prosperous married sisters moved
about the white bed in the little room, so
austere in its appointments that it might
have been a nun’s cell. “What long eye-
lashes!” they sighed, and wept over the
pink-and-whiteness of her; and “We always
said she should have entered the convent,”
they whispered. “She was so pretty, and
cared so little for men.”
But the twin-sister to her who lay dead,
who walked daily with poverty and a radiant
happiness, felt vaguely troubled. “What is
it you want, little sister?” she breathed as
she smoothed the rippling hair. And pre-
sently she drew the lilies" those others had
clasped between the dimpled hands, and in
their place slipped a pink briar rose. “She
was always so fond of pink,” she offered in
explanation ; and it seemed to her that the
little sister smiled whimsically, and remained
unsatisfied.
Later in the day the poet came and wept
as he looked down on the lifeless form. “1
loved Mignoh,” he cried; and again : “What
it has meant to me to be her lover! Inspira-
tion, courage, hope! My greatest w6rk was
the child of our love. I”- The prosper-
ous sisters wept in sympathy; but she who
knew happiness caught a whisper of laughter
from the bed.
Next, the great artist stepped into the
room and slipped to his knees beside the
dead. “Carissima ! My beautiful one !” he
whispered, and for a long tinie remained
quite still. Then he l'ose, and looking upon
her cried: “Death himself cannot take you
from me. Each curve of you lives forever in
my pictures of you—l” He broke into
sobs; and the two prosperous sisters led him
with comforting hands from the room, r
She who knew poverty and happiness shiv-
ered as another ripple of the dreadful mirth
that was all bitterness swept the air; and
even as it died away the Personage entered.
He was a very great personage indeed, and
he stood gaunt and bald with parchment-like
skin drawn over the large-boned face. He
drew his fingers across the dead woman’s
rounded cheeks; and to the tensely-alert
watcher it was the greedy--Touch of some
beast of prey. “I loved her,” he said. “She
meant—the fire of youth to me. When a
man grows old, place and power mean very
little, and age-chilled blood welcomes the sun
of early Summer. I do not know what I
shall do without her —I”
The twin-sister put her hands to her eyes
to shut out the little demons of grimacing
laughter; they leered and jeered at her from
every point of the room. When she became
conscious of things about her once more, the
twilight had deepened, and it was through
layers of soft greyness she saw the young
man out of the long ago. “I didn’t know.”
he stammered. “I was on my way to ask
Ann to marry me —you know I couldn’t ask
her before—and now—and now” Pie was
very white, but no tears fell from the steady
grey eyes. “I wanted to be so good to her
Poor little Ann! I hope there are no
rough places on the road and me not there
to lift her over.”
A sigh like that of a iired-out child as it
finally sinks to rest fluttered through the
room. A candle bent in the night breeze;
and as the sister, who was poor but. radi-
antly happy, moved closer to straighten it, her
gaze followed two round and glistening drops
that slid from under the closed lids, and fell
silently into the heart of the briar rose where
they lay like twin pearls.
