The Second Beading of the Crown Lands
Bill.
Sir John Robertson’s political friends can
have felt small satisfaction with hia speech on the
Amending Act upon the evening ot the Bth in-
stant. The law which he framed twenty years
before had been publicly impeached, and a new
measure had been demanded. His ans wcr was to
put forward the present work of clerical revision,
a thing of verbiage and official ink; a quack
salve to skin over a cancer.
• • •
To the Minister’s opponents there could have
been as little pleasure in hearing a veteran
politician reiterating with credulous fervency no-
tions which it needed only the breath of logic and
fact to scatter in shreds. Instead of meeting the
grave charges against the Act of 1861, which have
echoed through the colony for years past, Sir
John linked cause and effect in a rhmarole that
could not take in an ord-n ...45.un£ -.:*#• - 1
boy. If any meaning at all is to be gieaneu uom
the first half of his deliverance, it is that the
increase of the sheep-stock of the colony since
1861 was to be attributed to Free Selection.
Wealth, which is equally the gift of Nature and
the product of industry, was pointed to as the
fruit of a law that established insecurity and
discord as the first principles of agrarian policy !
# * •
Two months ago, we pointed out that the intel-
ligence of the country had reached a higher level
than that of the dominant politics; that this influ-
enoe was leavening the community, and that the
result might be expected to show at any time in
public life. On the occasion in question, a change
was manifest. The sympathy of the House was
plainly not with the Minister for Lands. There
was none of the enthusiasm that carried the Act
er 1861. Thinly occupied benches, and galleries
almost empty, gave sign of general apathy and
antagonism. Sir John’s whole speech was
laborious and dull, as it could hardly avoid being,
delivered as it was to an audience few in number,
and respectfully indifferent.
» • •
The address ot the leader of the Opposition in
reply struck the key-note of a sound Reform
policy. Mr. Stuart denounced all the abuses
of the existing law, as they have been placarded a
dozen times in The Bulletin —the class discords,
the intrigues and tricks of the rival ffictions,
the huge purchases compelled _in self-de-
fence, the universal debt and chicanery, the
land monopolies of financial corporations resulting
from the agrarian war, the forced concentration to
town life, the hopeless prospect for the youth of
the colony while the present system lasts, these
unanswerable reasons as to the necessity for a
reform he followed with suggestions which com-
prise the outlines of a good measure. _ The first
item in the list was a condemnation of indiscrimi-
nate selection. The second suggested the division
°f the colony into three classes of districts. The
third proposed the division of the present leasehold
B quattages—one half of each to be leased to the
present holder for the term of seven, ten, or fifteen
years, according to the districts. The fourth
proposed arrangements for settlement on the
resumed halves of the runs. These are the main
features of the policy put forward. The abolition
of improvement purchases! and auction sales, and
an amendment in the position of selections, are
also included. Much additional detail, of course,
' a required before these suggestions can take the
form of an Act. Some provision will be necessary
protect the resumed halves of runs so that they
may be kept for the legitimate purposes of settle-
ment. A fencing clause would also be desirable,
involving the rescission of the right of impounding
°n improved land. Also, a method of local ad-
ministration should be provided under trained
officials. To appoint elective boards, as proposed
b y the Selectors’ Delegates, would simply be to
open a new field for feud and faction.
• • •
Whatever may come of the debate, the signs of
tbs times point in the direction of land_ reform as
they have never done before. The mind of the
People ia stirred on the question. Numbers of
m®n who are neither squatters nor selectors are
ginning to fix their attention on the real nature
°f the incubus which dead-loeks our progress and
Corrupts our political life. They see clearly that
he administration of the colony must be con-
noted on new lines, to establish a basis of solid
Prosperity, and to provide in the unoccupied in-
"irior, the true field for their children’s energies.
0 repeat now what we said on this subject a few
® ago. Wo want a Land Bill that will give
In hud security, and that will provide scope
or all industries through a well-considered policy
preliminary survey. Such a law will not lease
the same land to one man and sell it to another;
it will not provide a huge land revenue to buy the
votes of political delegates; it will not bo worked
by setting different classes at each other’s
throats; and, further, in carrying out its pro-
visions it will bo well to avoid any precedents
established under the law of 1861.
Hanging a Lunatic.
The hangman will be busy in N.S.W, during the
next month or two. We are erecting a forest of
gallows. So many leg-ironed convicts await an
official visit from Mr. Howard that wo have
almost lost count of the number and are unable
mentally to separate those now actually ordered
to the scaffold from the long list of persons await-
ing trial, or from those who, after being convicted
of capital offences, have had their sentences com-
muted. There is Mr. M‘Guan, who battered
in the skull of his grey-bearded sleeping victim,
coolly cut the latter’s throat, and proceeded to
search for his money. This is the same Mr.IM'GuAN
who, when convicted, promised to “ meet the judge
and jury in hell’s flames, and pile up the coals on
them ” —not, mark yon, to “ heap coals of fire on
their heads.” Then, we have Mr. Dunn, the
representative Sydney picnic larrikin, who has
bean heaping on the coals in this world —Mr. Dux i
ho sot*lire to a house and roasted an old woman
to death. This, in order that ho might get a few
shillings reward for alarming the fire-brigade.
Mr. Dunn, it seems, had on previous occasions
set fire to dwellings, and been rewarded for it.
Should the Executive do its duty, be will shortly
be lighting fires for Pluto. Mr. Tester, the
wild beast who chopped dewn the little girl who
threw stones at his house, will also leave us ere
long. And James Cunningham, convicted of
having attempted to murder Warder Izett, at
Berrima Gaol, is to die on the 27th instant.
• • •
Now, though we don’t believe hanging is to-
day one whit more efficacious m respect to the
prevention of murder than it was as a preven-
tive of larceny in the good old times, when the
gallows was the prescribed remedy for a variety of
offences, ranging from the theft of a fonrpenny
loaf to cutting up one’s grandmother—though we
go so far as to believe that capital punishment not
only fails as a deterrent, but that on abstruse pys-
-chologioal grounds its existence can be held respon-
sible for many horrible deeds which, were the hang-
man abolished, would not be perpetrated--we do not
strongly object to the removal from our midst of
the three condamnes first named. But we have
some facts to put forward on behalf of Cunning-
ham which should induce the public very seriously
to consider whether they will not request the
Executive to re-consider its decision as to his
doom. Without further preface, we reprint from
our issue of 29th October, 1881—more than a year
ago (and long before the date of Cunningham’s
present crime) —an extract from one of a series of
articles on “ Our Prison System.” The fact that
this reference to Cunningham’s case was printed
so long ago entitles the statements of our con-
tributor (who wrote as an ex-oonviot) to much
more consideration than would attach to them did
he write after the event. But let us proceed :
THE CASE OF JAMES CUNNINGHAM.
“ In calling attention to this unfortunate man’s
case, I demand, in the name of our common humanity,
an in a airy. It is true that an investigation has already
vjonducted by the medical superintendent of lunatic
asylums. Dr. Manning; but ihafc, gentleman will, I
hope, forgive the remark that I believe ho had, to
some extent, however slight, been perhaps uncon-
sciously influenced by somebody else’s pre-established
opinion.
* * •
“ James Cunningham is a man of about 32 years
of ago, 5 ft. 6 in. or 5 ft. 7 in. in height, light haired and
fair, with a strongly-marked and sanguine nervous ton - •
perament, and with an expression of face which
puzzles most of the students of Lavater, his physiog-
nomy being a mixture of weakness and strength rarely
seen. When in repose and unobserved, I would have
no hesitation in pronouncing him an irresponsible
agent,| if once excited; while, when ho “ wakes up " his
very pronounced determination, he is as rational as
needs be. And that is the puzzle. He rarely speaks
to any one, and I have never met a prisoner who hgs
so completely adopted the silent system, voluntarily!
as he. • r
• * •
“ James Cunningham has been twice convicted*
and is noted in the prison records as a man of violent!
character, and to be specially watched. And I should
think he ought to be. Could Victor Hugo in his “ Lea
Miserables," or Mies Braddon in her “ Henry Dunbar,’*
have introduced such a character, what a success ii?
would have been 1 He was originally, in 1878, sentenced
to seven years* hard labour on the roai.a and public!
works of the colony. Being, as a matter of course
(although even from the beginning, there were donbtsl
as to his sanity, and during his prevk is sentence hei
had been “ under observation"), sent to Berrima, ha
* * broke out” there. He has a very violent temper, and
is possessed of a distinct monomania of a homicidal
tendency, which at first took the direction of
himself, and now of killing somebody else. His first
outburst related to the chief warder in Berrima, whom,
1 believe, ha abused horribly, and subsequently as-
saulted. His punishment was, firstly, dark cells ; se-
condly, a flogging; and thirdly, judicial trial, by widely
two years were added to bis former sentence. Subse-
quently he was sent to Darlinghurst, and placed in ther
“ observation wing," where he is to this day, tha
authorities regarding him (but not declaring him) as ai
lunatic. Not long after his arrival he was taken ill*
and transmitted to hospital ward No. 2. There he got
hold of a piece of tin, and, in the latrine, cut his throat:
with such determination that that clever surgeon, Dr-
Fortescue (who was sent for in a hurry), said two min-
utes more would have settled him. This was just two*
years ago. From that day to this Cunningham has had,
two special prison-guards (who receive indulgence for*
the extra duty), and who never leave him, night or day*

he aia’-.aged to get hold, of one of hia guardians* dinner-
knives, and stabbed him therewith in the back —an in-
significant wound, but enough to break the true skin-
For this he was committed, and received from Judge*
Wilkinson a sentenae of nine years! When he re-
turned from court he was put in “ muSs,” and still kepi*
under observation.
• • •
“ Although I have no doubt in my own mind thati
the man is mad, I confess it is not surprising that Dr-
Manning should adept Dr. O’Connor’s opinion (neitner*
of them havfng had the same opportunity as myself ofl
noticing his conduct) that it is only evil-minded ness*
that prompts his conduct t for whenever he is brought!
before the Medical Board, he addresses them in some-
thing after this fashion i— 11 Gentlemen, you wish to*
find out whether I’m insane or not. I know what I am*
called up here for. It is to see if I show any reasonable*
cause for disarrangement or not. lam perfectly sane.,
and the only th'ng I live for is to kill somebody—not a.
warder or free man—but one of those of my fellow*
prisoners, who are mean enough to take the billet off
watching me. And then I want to be hung. I’m per-
fectly sane ?’’
• * •
“And, in truth, he tried to carry out that purpose*
more than once. The “ muffs” had to be removed fort
a few minutes every morning while he washed himself,
and twice, nay thrice, he attempted, if not to kill, ah
aay rate to injure, his prisoner-guardians. Once hi*
split the whole front and centre of the skin of the head,
of hia principal watcher, who was an old prize fighter*
bat who was so tak n by surprise when the bucket de-
scended upon his head, with all the force of an enraged,
man who had stored up his energy for one single blow,
that he roared like a bull and ran like a hare. On an-
other occasion, Cunningham struck a man, also with a.
bucket, and had not other prisoners interfered, thera
wonldfhave been murder.
• • •
“ Finally, in January or February last, he rushed
down to one of the tables in No. 1 yard, oaught a knife,
and was going to stab —did, in fact, slightly stab—hirf
attendant, the gh the authorities did not dare to bring)
the matter be’ ore the public. For this and the previou*
offences, he h ,wever obtained mitigated punishments—
punishments itterly inadequate, if the man really i*
sane ; uUnrly unjust, if the man is irresponsible. But*
what do you think of this ?
• • •
V‘ He was then put in a straight-jacket, and fop
the last nir months or more has never been out of it.
night or day! What “ system,” what Venetian terror-
ism, is this—that punishes, as a madman, a man who iei
declared to be sane, and applies a kind of coercidu
which is obsolete. If James Cunningham is a respon-
sible beir ?, let him go among his fellow-prisonert, not-
withstanding his severe sentence, and when he breaksl.
the prisen regulations, let him be punished as others
are—no more. If he is not sane, for Heaven’s sake send,
him to an asylum, and do away with snoh a frightful
anomaly. Try to coni are up before your mind what it
means, to have, for months and months, in light and
darkness, one’s arms tied up in a canvas bag, always in
the same position, and without the possibility of an
inch’s movement —and then tell me if a really sane nan
should be subjected to snoh treatment. He is now only
a skeleton, comparative to what he was two years ago.
And no wonder."
• • •
We are entitled to contend, on the foregoing?
statement, than the miserable wretch, Cunning-
ham, is mad. Anyhow, we maintain that, even il!
he is not mad, according to the technicalities of a*
fossilized government department, he has at least:
so far lost his self-control as to be legally irre-
sponsible.
• • •
In this matter we appeal to Sir Henry Parries
on three grounds. Firstly, on the ground that he,
who is, or used to be, altogether opposed to tha
infliotior of the extreme penalty, for any offenca
whatsoever, should be the last man in the world
to consent to the execution of a convict who haa
not act’ .ally committed murder. Sir Henry pro-
fesses to be a Christian, and is, at times, most
disagreeably aggressive towards those who do nob
share the religious beliefs out of which he haa
chosen to make political capital. We ask him
where is his scriptural authority for taking tha
life of Cunningham, who, though he certainly
has “ shed blood,” ean only be helddo have dona

And thirdly. On Sir Henry mnst be fastened
a share of the moral responsibility incurred by the
execution of the wretched lunatic O’Farrell, for
whom the plea of insanity was unsuccessfully
raised. We now all know that O’Farrell was,
must have been, mad. And, remembering that at
least one Innatio has been hanged in N.S. W., will
the Government, without further enquiry, under-
take the responsibility of hanging Cunningham?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Executive and the Woman-Griller.
Judging from the drift of certain remarks by Judge
Windeyer, and from the tenor of an article in the S.
M. Herald, the Government is not likely to hang
Bunn, the arsonist who roasted Mrs. Weight for the
sake of five pieces of silver. Yet Cunningham, to
Whose case we draw attention in a leading article, is
to be executed on the 27th instant, for “ attempting’’ to
kill a warder at Berrima. Again, Robertson, who,
while under committal, deliberately tried to poison a
man who was to be called as a witness against him, by
mixing strychnine with grog, gets off with 15 years,
despite the fact that there is very good reason for be-
lieving him to have murdered a Crown witness who,
.some time since, mysteriously disappeared. The ways
of our Executive, and of law and lawyers generally in
New South Wales, are indeed inscrutable. When we
•remember that the arch-scoundrel and hypocrite
Plomer, who violated his pupils, was the other day re-
prieved; that the Executive, three years ago, hanged a
dirty, drunken, miserable blackfellow for a criminal
assault, and let off two white villains, convicted at
the same time of a similar offence, on the twaddling
pretext that they had apologised in the condemned
©ell—to quote the Premier, “had always maintained
the honour of the girl ” —we are stricken with amaze-
ment. Pnblic spirit must indeed be dead if the citizens
view complacently the strangulation of an infuriated
lunatic, who, in his frenzy, has “tried” t© kill a
warder, and at the (same time smugly approve of the
reprieve of such a monster as Dunn, the woman
grfiler.
Political Poker.
Politics is a game of bluff. When you can’t beat your
opponent’s hand fair and square on the cards, yon can
pile up the “ ante ’’ till you score the square players off.
If inconvenient charges are made against you, yon can
thump down a writ of libel for a thundering big sum,
and hold it in terrorem until the scandal sinks into
oblivion. If yon suddenly lose half-a-million or more
•of State property by mysterious cremation, you can
promise to erect a magnificent substitute that shall
outshine its predecessor—and then you can lay hack
and forget all about it. If you are accused of anything
unsavoury en a motion of adjournment, you can pooh
pooh it and ask for a definite resolution. When you
get that definite resolution, yon can “ go one better ’’
by asking for specific charges. And so the game goes
merrily en. The best bluffer wins. The Yankee
Colonel knew the value of the game of bluff when he
said: “ When I play poker, I alius win. If I haint got
the keerds, I bluff and bluff. Then, if the other man
* sees ’ me, I out with my shooting-iron, and I guess he
don’t • see * me any more.” Sir Henry Parkes is a
wily adept at political poker. The tourney between
the Government and Mr. Qarvan has bean, so far, re-
sultless—resultless by machinery. Mr. Garvan accused
Mr. Watson, the Treasurer, with so mismanaging the
wharves as to throw money into wharf-owners’ pockets,
and pointed out that Mr. Watson was himself one of
the largest wharf-owners. Mr. Watson “hurled the
charges back with contempt," and said that “if one
scintilla of them were proved, he would be unworthy
to occupy the honourable position he holds.” Sir
Henry Parkes dittoed, and challenged Mr. Garvan to
submit a specific motion. Mr. Garvan did submit
such a motion, and was then met with the cross-counter
that, though the motion was definite, the charges were
not “ specific." Mr. Garvan had accused Mr. Watson
of—only making a rebate of ten percent, at the Circular
Quay wharf, while he allowed four times ten per cent,
at his own private wharf; of putting taxation to the
extent of £60,000 or £70,000 annually, not into the
Treasury, but into the pockets of agents of vessels, he
being himself one of these principal agents; of “ rob-
bery of the public funds,” and playing into the hands
of private wharfingers, &o. &c. Are not these charges
specific?” However, if Mr. Garvan has a scintilla
of pluck, it is now his turn to “go one better,” and
“ see” the Government’s “hand.” This little scandal
cannot be “ pooh-poohed ’’ into nothingness.
Our Stipendiary Warriors.
A vote appears on the Estimates for an additional
sum for the purpose of adding another battery to the
present strength of the Permanent Artillery. It there
is one branch of the defence service thoroughly honey,
combed with discontent it is the Permanent Artillery.
The corps has been established about twelve years.
Since its formation three batteries have been raised.
The total strength of a battery is supposed to consist
of 103 rank and file. So that there should be 309 men
all told. Such a number could not be mustered it a full
parade were called to-morrow. But this is not all.
Since its establishment to the present date, 902 men
been enrolled in the Artillery, so that 623 men
have either been discharged by effluxion of time, been
expelled with disgrace, or have deserted. Desertions,
according to correspondents, are very common.
The men complain that the officers are petty, over-
bearing and tyrannical. Heavy punishment fol-
lows the wearing of private clothes. The
being compelled to constantly wear uniform is
very distasteful to the men, and one correspondent
urges that good-conduct men might be allowed the
privilege of wearing their private clothes for a portion
of the week. Another complaint is that promotions do
not go by merit, but to outsiders. For instance, a
sergeant in charge of the Provost recently retired, and,
instead of other sergeants obtaining the vacancy, a man
was installed “ from off the street." The men have no
esprit de corps, and express no surprise at comrades
being ready to desert whenever opportunity offers
Perhaps some warlike member will ventilate this
grievance in the House, asking, at the same time, how
it happens that so many gallant colonels, etc., are, at
the present time, doing the dolcefay niente business on
the “ Continong ’’ and elsewhere at the expense of this
bleeding country.
Concerning’ a Jolimontary Matter.
We vary our amusements in N.B. Wales. We had got
oyer the Woniora joke, when the railway department
offered ns a litto sport up at Bathurst. A mail and
passenger train tried to occupy the same spot on the
same set of rails as a goods train and failed. Luckily,
there were no fatalities, though the train was well
filled with passengers, including amongst others the
Montague-Turnee Opera Troupe, who were dne to
play at Orange that night. The principal reports
returned the wounded at one boy with fractured
thighs, and an old lady with a “ gashed eyebrow.” But
one of the passengers has sent to the Nooze what
Alfred calls a “ graphic and pathetic account,” and
from this we glean that the casualties run somewhat in
this style. One man “had his back broken and is
otally paralysed;” a boy named John Headland,
adopted son of railway porter O’Rourke, had both
thighs fractured; the old lady who had her “ eyebrow
gashed ” had also “ part of her forehead smashed in ;”
Mr. Denham, one of the Montague-Turner baritones,
was knocked silly for a whole day and didn’t know his
friends from strangers; Mr. Balfour, a tenor, strained
his neck and chest; Herr Kotraschek hurt his chest;
the mechanist bruised his leg; the “ very little man in
the chorus" was jammed till, “like a nigger he was black
all over;” Signora Venosta’s lip was “cut to pieces,”
and her knee badly hurt; while nearly everybody was
bandaged or plastered in some more or less vital part.
This “graphic and pathetic” passenger is palpably a
wounded singer. Wa expect the country will
have a healthy little bill to pay for this accident, for
which, of course, there is “nobody to blame.” The
signalling machinery was out of order. The B.M.
Herald says the wires were “ contracted ; ” the D.T.,
on the other hand, says that a rod connected with the
danger signal had 11 expanded with the heat; ” though,
as the accident occurred at 3 20 a.m., the rod, if it had
any reverence for the laws of nature, ought to have
been cool again. Perhaps the only cool article was the
engine-driver, who, it is alleged, when he saw that a
collision was inevitable, put on the brake, and, jumping
off the tender, left the engine to go to destruction in—
barring the brake—otherwise unfettered style. But
let us hops that, after all, we shall have to pay Darling.
Harboury, and not Jolimontary, damages.
"The Visitation of God.”
There are many in the colony who remember the days
in England, not yet entirely passed away, when every
occurrence, for which no sufficient cause could be
found, was set down as a “visitation of God.” We
have just had a proof that the wretched old phrase
formerly used as a cloak for ignorance is used
in this colony as a cloak for greed, to which those
men whose function it is to lead the public, will not
give a name. The Woniora was lost on the 28th Novem-
ber. On Monday following, the Herald, with indecent
haste, assigned the vessel’s loss to a “ visitation of
God.” The Treasurer, a few nights later in Parlia-
ment, grasping at something to help his own painful
lack of ideas, repeated, “ a visitation of God," and the
newspapers have gone on porrotting the miserable
phrase. Does any of them know what it means ? Does
it not mean that God used the established for the
government of the world, excited winds to blow and
waves to tower, that He) might compass the death of
some sixteen miserable men and the sinking of a ship ?
And that, in spite of God Almighty, one man escaped
the doom set for him ? And this is called piety I !
Every man in the colony not absolutely a fool knows
that the Woniora was no more lost through a visitation
of God (whatever that may be) than the Garden Palace
was burnt through one.
Thus speaks a writer in a recent number of the
Imperial Review, a Melbourne quarterly:—“After all,
what history have the other provinces since Victoria
sprang up? They have been mainly engrossed in
business, leaving Victoria to fight out all questions that
rise to a higher platform. Their histories are dull as
ditch-water. Ours is instinct with life and movements
on every page. Victoria is the iron spear-head of
Australia. The other provinces may be jointed into
the wooden head of the pike.’’ However unpalatable
this may be to New South Welshmen, it is disgustingly
true. Nearly all the great political changes Australia
has witnessed were inaugurated in the land of the Berry
blight—as rabid “Constitutionalists’* delight to
sneeriugly call it. Its volcanic politics gave to Victoria
vote by ballot, mauhsed suffrage, land taxation, and
something like a comprehensive system of free, secular
and compulsory education. When New South Wales
starts a change, it only copies from its younger sister,
Its politics run slavishly in old worn-out grooves. It
is the best-formed Constitution for log-rolling. Its
system of centralisation gives Ministers personal
powers, commands the votes of country “ noses,’’ and
chokes political advancement.
Who can fathom some juries* verdicts ? At the
Quarter Sessions, a man was tried for fraudulent insol-
vency. The point to distinguish was whether ho erred
from ignorance of the law, or whether ho deliberately
intended fraud. So strong a case did his counsel make
out, that one of two alternatives appeared to an out-
sider to be irresistible. Either was he innocent, or
else he was a doubly.cunning criminal. A former jury
had disagreed. This one didn’t. They sent up the
curious verdict, “Guilty, with a recommendation to
mercy.’* The only ground for mercy was that he acted
ignorantly : ergo, he had no fraudulent intent— ergo, he
was not guilty. On the other hand, if guilty in
this doubly-cunning way, he was not entitled to
be mercifully dealt with. From the noble British
jury, good Lord deliver us! But it was
the “other fellow,’’ probably, who endeavoured
with the first jury to deliver “Thunderbolt’’
from the danger in which he was placed through
attempting t® “pot" Constable Chapman, because the
latter interfered in a little burglary business. Thunder-
bolt looked his men well over as the jurors were named.
He “challenged" right and left; and he, somehow or
other, hit upon a set containing one or two of his ewn
kidney. There was no dispute that he shot at the
policeman several times ; but this model jury could not
find it in their minds to agree that Thunderbolt had
even been guilty of an assault! It w.iuld be interesting
to know the names of the “ stickers,” and follow up
their future eareers.
Sydney has been alive during the past week with
slouching firemen. The Herald has indulged in a
heap of sarcasm at the expense of these colourod-coated
heroes, and suggests that, as they are “ inured to
danger," they might be made to form the nucleus of a
trained military force. (I) They must learn to walk
first. A far more brilliant idea—and we give it to an
appreciative world gratis—would be to make the mem-
bers of our Football Association into a corps d’armie,
because they really are “ inured to danger.” The
torchlight procession was a cheerful spectacle—at a
distance. The celebrated “hungry army” of Eureka
was distanced “ quite considerably ” by this “ pro'
cession,” the utility of which may be set down at nil,
and the cost at a large amount. The hoodlum was in
full swing, and many a larrikin burst his vest with
joy at the golden opportunity for horse-play. The
genius who manipulates the machinery of our wonderful
Police Department sent seven men to control ton
thousand members of a disorderly mob. And the result
was simply beautiful. There was a run on raw beef-
steak and sticking-plaster next morning; a few China-
men got half-killed; and a quantity of city property
was destroyed, in order that the fire brigades of
the colonies might be “demonstrated.” The compe-
tition on the following days was a trifle
livelier than a ploughing match, because you
could get excited with the “ half-crown trick,”
and stood a chance to get “ broke” at monte. Eedfern
showed in front at engine practice, and was followed
closely by other N.S.W. brigades; but the rest of the
prizes went chiefly to Victoria. The Carlton brewery
team advertised the merits of malt liquor by carrying
off three first prizes. We have the satisfaction of
knowing for certain that we are far behind Victoria in
general fire brigade arrangements, and that our average
fireman is a cross between a larrikin and a sleuch. We
don't exactly understand why the mob of hobbledehoys
sent over from Victoria should wear so many tin
medals and be attired in so many colours. The nearer to
his ancestor—the savage—a man is, the more he loves
gaudiness and tawdriness. The black fellow who rubs
himself with fat, plasters on top of the fat aforesaid as
much ochre as will stick—he, perhaps, also puts a bone
through his nose, and a string of beads round his neck,
and marks in chalk the outlines of his bones. How-
ever, we prefer to judge the firemen, not by their
uniforms, but by their conduct, which on all occasions
would do credit to a man who was so happy as to com-
bine in his proper person all the virtues of both Napo-
leon and Chesterfield.
The iniquitous verdict given against us in the Clontarf
case has not been fruitless. The hoodlum has changed
his base of operations, The usual collection of black-
guards did not, on 9th November, go down the harbour.
Lorrikindom celebrated Albert Edward’s birthday by
two-penny tram-rides, instead of by a shilling harbour-
excursion. Clontarf was, this year, almost distressingly
moral. The noble British workman enjoyed the cool
shade of the whispering fig-tree, or stood up and played
an innocent game of “rounders’* with his olive
branches. Policeman X, who mustered in some force i
had nought to do save murmur soft nothings to the
fays, and chuck the virtuous spinster’s chin. But The
Herald gives a—for it—most sensational account of
certain doings at Botany on the festive day—and,
characteristically enough, spoils the effect cf its narra-
tive by dwelling, with “ caution verging on cowardice,”
on the virtuous zeal with which the man who keeps
the hotel and supplied the company with liquor
assisted the police to eject larrikins and maintain
order. We want to know from Judge Manning whether
The Herald’s statements concerning Botany are not
all lies—whether the rampant blackguardism spoken of
isn’t a mere myth. However, the Hunter-street
George Washington is supposed never to fib, so we
presume that the picnic larrikins have all sprung into
being since the Clontarf trial—that previously they
never had existence.
Commodore-Qeneral Gazzler of the Tire
Brigade.
We present our readers this week with a portrait
on page 9 of Commodore-General Guzzler of
the L.C B.D.X.W.D. Fire Brigade. General
Guzzler is a representative house-breaking fire-
man, and has honourably won distinction. The
General is a native of Bnssex-street. He never
stayed long in any school. At the age of ten the
General joined his brigade, and has been drinking
ever since. Like all the members of his company,
the General is decorated with medals, and is an
accomplished fireman and property destroyer. He
won his epaulettes in a hand-to hand fight with
another fireman foi the use of a street main. His
top row of medals represents the result of one of
his most arduous conflicts; he was the only man
of his company sober at two consecutive fires.
The middle row is for the brave manner in which
he saves pier glasses and other similar property
from third stories. The lowest cluster of trinkets
was won on the occasion when he left three
children and an aged grandmother to perish in
the flames while he went round the corner for a
drink. General Guzzler is a very attractive person
in uniform, and neither spits nor swears in pubbo.
He sometimes works. [We are indebted to the
Police for his portrait.]
Lady Brassey has just recovered from a bad
attack of typhoid.
The coaling contractors of the unfortunate
Austral were the Bull! Co.—the owners of the ill-fated
Woniora.
Mrs. Langtry cleared .£8123 during the twelve
weeks of her provincial tour. She does not speculate
in her American campaign, but accepts a modest cer-
tainty of seven hundred pounds per week and the pay-
ment of all expenses.
A son has been born to Lord and Lady Brooke
(Mies Maynard, the celebrated beauty). And there is
now an heir to the estates of the amorous Lord
Shrewsbury, who first ran away with Mrs. Miller-
Mundy, and then married her after her rightful hus-
band had obtained a divorce.
The Derby County Club have, by thirty-three
to one, expelled Lord Shrewsbury and returned him his
subscription. This is because of his affair with Mrs.
Miller- Mundy. His Lordship, prior to the passing of
the resolution, demanded a statement of the charges
preferred against him, and threatened anyone taking
part in the matter with legal proceedings.
Cole of George and King streets has bridged the
distance between Sydney and London, Paris and New
York, by means of the ocean-going steamers, and landed
here this week the biggest collection of Christmas
cards he has yet offered the Australian public. The
design all through is strikingly new, and the style of
execution shows there’s life in the old world yet. The
American' designs are extremely novel, and present
some new features in mechanics. The hand-painted
and photo flowers are fit fora Qoeen. We havearranged
with Cole to send a few for us with our autographs to
favourite monarohs; S3 we may expect a royal reception
when we go home.
The big sale of Drummoyne Park by Watkin
and Watkin last Saturday shows that the coming season
is going to witness some very large land sales about
Sydney. The fact is the average profit on all land in-
vestments last year has been from fifteen to twenty-
five per cent. Consequently the opening season wit-
nesses renewed confidence land increased investment in
genuine announcements The total result of Watkin and
Watkin’s three hours and a quarter effort at Drutn-
moyne last Saturday was over £35,000. The total for
the week £56,000. Drummoyne is on the Parramatta
Elver, and the prices ran from 35s. to £8 17s, fid. pec

ONE OP THE WORLD’S GREATEST
OARSMEN.
JN a recent conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
a representative of one of the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Triokett, the celebrated
oarsman, who la at present open to row any man in the
world, rave the following; as hla opinion.
•* I have found St, JACOB'S ©IL a sure and certain
core, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in back, brought on by ovor-ex-
ertion ha rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sure
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without farther trouble."
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what he was talking about; and now he says
that St. JACOB’S OIL and good athletic training, ar
what all our young men want.

three to 15 minutes. It is the only ointment that has
certificates of merit from the managers of all the
foundries in Sydney. It acts magically in wounds,
bruises, sores, sun-burns, corns, bunions, and has a
curative effect on lung complaints, when rubbed into
the cheat. Every Householder should keep a pot.

Panl Boyton, the duck swimmer, is starting oil

Ha thinks of swimming down the Murray first, then

Some ridiculous radicals have been making a
row because little Gussy is allowed a first-class carnage

for the guvnah in Russia, the authorities used to allow
him one carriage for himself, and one for his feet.

get a first-class passage up in a fiery chariot.
Mr. John Walsh, one of the members for Cook,
WQ. who has been attending to his Parliamentary
duties by running a store in N.S.W. for ever so long, is
alluded to by the Cooktown Herald as “ the illustrious
stranger.” Says the Herald i “It is rumoured that
onr senior n. ember has resolved onoe again to revisit
the cradle of his power and importance, and he will
doubtless receive that warm reception which bis eon-
sideration and services entitle him to expect.
Murdoch has not only a turn for batting, but for
satire, also. In his speech in reply to the health of the
Eleven at the Criterion banquet, he said: I have to
thank Lady Denison for her very kind wishes, and also
the various noblemen and others who have intimated
their inability to be present.” Very neat; and, strange
to say, that was just what was being remarked by a
noble lord at the swell dinner-party at which Sirenrae
was so (historically) late. Who shall say, after this,
that history doesn't repeat itself?
Mr. Charles Welch Tennant, of Rumgally,
Scotland, has been prosecuting hie wife criminally for
ÜbeL In cross-examination, he admitted that she had
given him £70,000; but he didn't like being called
“ blasphemous, boastful, blubbering, bellowing Charlie,
a disbeliever in a hereatter and in the existence of any
god except Mammon.” We shouldn't care about being
called this, either; but there are circumstances under
which wo could support even this indignity. We eoald
stand being called everything except the Tribune for
£70,000 a pop.
Mr. John Harris, we believe, will this year be
elected Mayor of Sydney lor the third time. The
aldermen will thus afford to Mr. Hams, in his im-
broglio with the distinguished and much-esteemed Mr.
Davies. C.M.Q., their moral support. And, by the
way, Mr. John Davies and his friends needn't trouble
themselves about the proposed expenditure of cor-
poration funds in connection with the approaching
Blander trial. Mr, Harris has plenty of money, and
wants from the aldermen, not corporation funds, but
corporation support. Which he has got.
Said Sydney Taiwhanga, the Maori ambassador,
to us, the other day: “ The missionaries came and told
us to turn our eyes to heaven. While we looked from
earth, they snatohed away our lands.” Tolerably neat,
this. And this, also by Taiwhanga, is neat: “Kereopa
was the man who killed missionary Volkner and
swallowed his eyes. The Maoris sold Kereopa— gave
him over to the English for money. The Maoris are
like the Irish —they sell their cause or their brother
Again: “If it were not for the Missionaries, we should
not be what we are now. You must give the devil his
due."
Dante Gabriel Rossetti (the poet who died last
Eister Sunday), when his wife died more than twelve
years ago, was so plunged in despair, that he flung the
autograph manuscript of his composition into her
ooffla, and it was buried with her. Borne of his friends
who knew the value of the poems, persuaded him some
lime after to have .the coffin exhumed, and the neces-
sary leave having been obtained, this was done. It was
found that Mrs. Rossetti’s hair had grown very long
after death, and had completely enmeshed the M.B. io
extricate it, it was necessary to cut off the whole of the
hair of her head. The poems were published in 1870.
Mr. Robert Ballard, the eminent Queensland
railway engineer, has published in New York a book on
“The Solution of the Pyramid Problem.” He claims
to have discovered the secret of the Egyptian pyramids
—the purpose for which they were built. His argument
~and it is ingeniously supported —is that they were
not merely mausoleums of dead kings, but were ‘ used
for the purposes of land surveying by right-angled
triangles with sides having whole numbers. In fact,
he argues that the pyramids were the ** theodolites ol
the Egyptians.” He believes that all the pyramids are
connected with each other by undiscovered subter-
ranean passages, and recommends that this idea he
tested with a diamond drill and two or three hundred
feet of rods. Mr. Ballard may wake up some fine morn-
mg and find himself famous.
The latest of H. J. Woodhouse’a ghastly
“natural reflections’* in Adelaide Punch to hand is
the supposed portrait of Sir Henry Ayers, G.,
Preaident of the S.A. Legislative Council. Bit Henry
A. ig by no means an Adonis, but he is what the Yankee
Press said ol our own Premier, “ distinguished look-
mg.” H. J. W. has, however, with artistic finish,
depicted the face as that of a diabolical, low-browed,
Krizzled murderer, whose look is sufficient to freeze
the marrow of the intelligent kangaroo which sits
Paralysed in the foreground. But then the artist
compensates in the lower portion ol Ayer s ana-
tomy. His legs are thin and splder-like, and his
characteristic corporation is hidden aaaay in a
twelve-inoh pair ol knickerbockers, which seem
adapted somehow to stand the strain. Apparently, the
President can scratch his ankle without stooping or
jilting his foot, while his bnll-neok ie several inches
mrger than his waist. Sir Henry Ayers is evidently
fcoout to sit down, and ths artist has displayed a com-
mendable delicacy in showing ns his back view oe/ors
he has essayed that perilous feat. R H. J. W. haUu t ,
named " his “ pioter,” it could have done service as a
B Peaking likeness of an ideal figure—upper-half Goto-
»*yo, and lower-biff, Sara Damala, the divine broom-
stick.
Frank Warden’s been “ pitching in Newcastle.
He is a great success and hundreds flock to the Recreation
Reserve te hear him. Prank is decidedly holy, and we
wish him luck. We eannot but consider him a genius
both at Belling soap and curing souls. When he was
baptising in Sydney we regarded him as the oom-
pletost cure we ever saw. Prank has given up Baptism
at latest dates. His last •'subject” was a lady of
35 stone, and Mr. warden complained that it took him
too long to walk round her. While he was fixing her up
for the beautiful laud ** over dar ’* about 65,000 other
unfortunates were going to hell. Prank then girded up
his loins, and sold soap. A curious thing, by the way,
that it never occurred to him to sell soap to the people
ha was baptising. It is left for us to suggest all these
things.
Says a Melbourne paper •. —“ The Queen was
delighted when the Prince appeared in the witness-box
over the case of Mordaunt v. Mordaunt." Oh, was she ?
In any case, H.R.H. didn’t appear in the box at all, but
on the Bench. He was the sickest witness ever knoira.
Lady Mordannt’s counsel put loading questions, and he
said “No" to everything. Then herjeanb Ballantyne
refused to cross-examine the Prince i and, shaking hands
with his Lordship, the royal witness got into his car-
riage, and was driven away, amid, we regret to say, a
shower of very uncomplimentary remarks from the
crowd. This is a matter of history. There are
other matters connected with this incident which
are also historical. We shall, however, wait, before
refeiring to them, until the motto of our paper is the
secret of England’s greatness, England’s glory. The
evidence was all published in tho Aon (Melb.) at the
time.
The Comtesse do Losseps, we are glad to see,
won’t put up with any nonsense from those common
newspapers. The Observes (the best of the London
weeklies) having had the temerity to give her old man
a “ doing," Madame thus addresses the editor:— The
French papers have translated an article in which you
find M. Be Lesseps an embarrassment to your acts of
bad faith, and in which you advise the English autho-
rities to embark him on board a steamer leaving for
Marseilles. Well, I recommend you to go yourself, and
put this project into execution. You may be sure that
you will meet with the reception yon deserve. We
don’t know whether the editor went, but we do know
that the Baron de Lesseps is 72 and Madame 19, and
that their family is increasing all the time. We merely
mention this in out own chatty littlo way. We don t
know why.
A few years ago. the owner of an industrial estab-
lishment within a short steamer journey of Blanktown
married a charming young lady, and, in due time, at fit
and proper Intervals, five successive pledges of marital
affection came on the scene. While, however, the
industrious husband was at his daily routine, and the
five pledges of connubial unity of purpose were engaged
at their usual occupations of making slush custards, or
, falling asleep with their heads in the fender, another
man appeared on the scene. Ho was a polisher; so
polished that ho quite took the shine out of number
i one, and soon took —his wife. The fond lover and frail
lady went over the seas and far away. Detectives were
paid, telegrams wired, and they were pursued. A lively
interview; entreaties and threats; at last the erring
fair and her Don Juan parted. But only for a time j for
the mall beat brought her back but to get a divorce,
and ho yearns for the day when by law set free she will
fly to his arms again.
Every day we hear of stout, wealthy old gentle-
men dying of broken blood vessels, apoplexy, etc. We
all must die, and Nature, in killing us, has such a
variety of diseases to choose from that we need not add
further weapons to her armoury. These reflections were
suggested by a eight we saw the other morning. A fat,
sixty-five year old millionaire, whe had evidently just
finished a hearty breakfast, hailed a ’bus two hundred
yards off, and rushed after it as fast as his varicose-
veined legs could carry him, passing the cab-rank by the
way. Poor old fellow 1 His liver is about twice as big
as it should be, and his heart is weak, and his lungs are
occasionally quite engorged, and he’s near the grave
and can’t possibly be long out of his bone-box—yet he
goes on money-grubbing and matutlnally strains his
internal organs in the endeavour to reach town for two-
pence instead of paying a cabman eighteenpenoe. Ho 11
make a delightful post-mortem, one of those days, will
this economical old gentlemen, who is the type of many
more in Sydney.
So tho great lawsuit between Wehr (the local
Potts) and Bailey (the ditto Slurk), who at Temora so
emulate the historic doings of their Eatanswill proto-
types, is over for the present, and Ulnrk, the defendant,
has proved victorious. It seems that Bailey used to
call Wehr a “ Wizzle-wozzle" and a “Butter-keg,
while Wehr alluded to Bailey as a “ Blow.fly," and
accused him of stealing telegrams from the Star about
the bombardment of Alexandria. [Ml] He also accused
Bailey of writing “ literary sewage," and, Bailey says,
tried to make out that he burnt down the pianoforte case
he used to print in. On one occasion Bailey wrote that
Wehr was a giddy boy, addicted to sirens smiles and
“ Mutrumbidgee, whereupon the “ Wizzle-wozzle
“ spat in the defendant’s face." What appeared to
hurt Wehr most, though, was being designated by
Bailey as “a faatherless crane.” In revenge for this,
the “ Butter-keg" made.iso it was alleged, one of a pmty
to “ nail a coffin against Bailey’s door I" Tho verdict
was for the defendant, but the judge did not express an
opinion as to which was tho greater idiot —Potts tho
“ Butter-kog,” or Slurk the “ Blow-fly."
Thus the D.T. of last Thursday “ The funeral
of the late Mr. James Greenwood, M.A., took place on
Tuesday afternoon at tho Necropolis. The remains
were buried in tho grave where lie two of his children,
and round the grave stood a small circle of those he
loved best—the widow and daughters, Mr. and Mrs.
J. 8. Palmer, Dr. Garran, Mr. E. Lewis Scott, Rev. Mr.
Clare, and Messrs. Taylor and Dole. The Congrega-
tional minister from Point Piper-road Chapel prayed
over the grave" (of the representative Sydhey free-
thinker). Now, we wonder who wrote this paragraph.
At least, we don’t wonder. We’re tolerably certain as
to its authorship. “ A small circle of those he loved
best—Dr. Garran and Mr. B. Lewis Scott 1" Hannibal
and the captain of the Paddington Portergaflsj tho
best-informed and biggest literary man in the com-
munity and Mr. E. Lewis Scott 1 Poor dead Greenwood
must indeed have been varied in his tastes. What is
this the D.T., which purports to bo a Sydney paper,
has been giving us F A paragraph stating in effect that
the lamented Mr. Greenwood, loved best, next to his
wife and children,—well, we needn't continue tho
subject.
There is a long article by a French journalist in
the Nineteenth Cbntdrt on the French press, which,
as translated, is rather a peculiar sample of English
composition. But it is interesting. It tolls ns that the
Journal des Dbbats is the most influential of
Parisian papers, and that Lk Petit Journal has the
largest (fiOO.OOO) circulation. Rochefort’s L’inteansi-
gbant, though circulating widely amongst the lower
classes, has little or no influence, while Qambetta’s
organ. La Republique Francaisb (on the staff of
which paper the writer appears to be) is a great power
in tho state. The Parisian papers don’t go in exten-
eively for “ads." As a sample of printing and of
paper, the Evening News of Sydney would, we should
say, find many admirers in the French capital. When
Rochefort was here, he used to look at our newspapers
with undisguised wonderment. What, however, sur-
prised him most in them was the intelligence he used
to read about himself. We knew Rochefort when he
was on the staff of the Figaro and used to serve the
poor Emperor up such a dose of satire daily. We knew
him later when he was running La Lantbrne, a little
pamphlet consisting of one scathing article, and which
sold by thousands at sd. a copy. When out of prison,
or home from exile, he would sit of an afternoon out-
side the Cafe do Subde, a journalistic haunt, next to tho
Theatre des Variety, chaffing for hours writers more
sallow and untidy than himself, and sipping an absinthe
gommi. There seems to be a good deal of French in
this, but we can’t help it. We didn’t have the gaming
of them, or we could have contented ourselves with the
dulcet language of Wooloott. There axe better writers
than Rochefort in Paris, but not one of them can draw
so much money single-handed. And that reminds us
that in France everyone who can sling ink, or who is in,
or wishes to attain, a prominent position, writes in the
papers. Louis Napoleon used te write articles da-ly, so
didThiers, and so does Grovy. The latter makes jam
also, by the way. The Bonapartist princes all scribbled,
and a newspaper row led to Prince Pierre shooting
Victor Lenoir, who belonged to the Gaulois. The cir-
culation of papers generally is small in Frhhoe*
in the large towns they are read principally in the
CaWs s and in the small places people are shy of having
journals mailed to them, as tho police, by the titles of
the papers, can discern the political proclivities of the
recipients. And this is awkward, sometimes, in
France.
They’ve made Sir Garnet Wolaeley Baron of
Cairo. This is good. And yet, the upshot of hi*
brilliant feat of arms will be that the money-lending,
and the Btate-faimiug bloodsuckers that Arab! chased*
will all return* and once more prey upon the Fellahs, i
And talking of Arabi, a writer—Blunt by name—ln the |
Nineteenth Century* in an exhaustive article makes
a powerful appeal for Arab!. The author of the paper
was the intermediary for a long time between Arabi a
party and the Khedive and Sir Edward Malet, and he
states that the vanquished Minister Is the most gentle
of men, and has what ne Turk (hi says) possesses, an
honest heart and true patriotic feeling. The Khedive s
entourage he atta( ks m the most trenchant manner,
declaring that the Viceroy’s favourite is a Frenchified
Turk,” and that hie other Ministers are either grasp-
ing usurers or time-serving lickspittles. The picture
he draws of Sir Edward Malet’s diplomacy is of a
startling nature, and represents H.B.M. Consul la the
character of an irresolute and incompetent official. Of
course, there will be replies to all this; but those who
read the article will perceive in its earnestness the
obvious impress ef conviction,
Tennyson has been writing: some more of his
poetry at £3 a line. It is an ode " written at the
request of the Mantnans for the 19th centenary of
Virgil’s death," and is interesting if only to prove how
the laureate is changing his style, and what a slavish
admirer he Is of alliteration. The poem is. on the
whole, a good production; but it is not worth Jw a
line. That is, no one in Australia would pav that sum
for it—exoept Alfred. The reader will be able to judge
ef the whole from these samples
** Thou that singest wheat and woodland,
tilth and vineyard, hive and Horse and Herd;
All the charm of all the Muses
often flowering in a lonely word ;
Thou majestic in thy sadness
at the doubtful doom of human kind;
Poet of the happy Tityrns , „
piping underneath his beeohen bowers. • •
It is said, by the way, that Tennyson writes under the
influence of coarse Cavendish tobacco (smoked in a
church-warden) and Old Tom Gin. We wonder what
Sir Henry writes his poetry onP Probably Dutch
cheese or—tripe.
Mr. E. B. Sheridan, “the King of Mary-
borough," Q., who is about leaving for a Holiday, is to
be handsomely testimonialisod, He is the senior P.M.
and Justice of the Peace in Queensland, and has never
had an appeal or prohibition against any of his de-
cisions. He was the first local man to invest money in
sugar-growing, and was chiefly instrumental in estab-
lishing all the principal public institutions of Mary-
borough, to which ne introduced State education.
During the local floods he on several occasions showed
great pluck and energy, and wm the means of saving
many lives. He has been a true friend to the Wide Bay
aborigines, end has been treated with the grossest in-
justice by the present Queensland Government because
le ventured to speak out on the Kanaka question. Mr.
Sheridan halls, of course, from the Green Isle. He is a
silver-haired old gentleman, but belongs to that happy
(and limited) class who, .having the mens sana, in corpora
go,no, never lose either the physical or mental elasticity
of their earlier years. Mr. Sheridan, though probably
on the verge of seventy, finds time and energy to inter-
eat himself In everybody—be has a kind word for wmb
of his black proteges, and always has a neat poetic
compliment to offer the pretty girls of Maryborough,
whom ho remembers as children, as they promenade
the beautiful Botanic Garden (loveliest of all Queens-
land public reserves) which, years ago, he instituted.
No wonder that Mr. Sheridan should be popular with
the Wide Bay residents, or that one of the local papers
should express a hope that ho may yet be their Par-
liamentary representative.
The news of “ Arthur Sketohley’a ” death could
not have been unexpected to those who knew him. The
enormous dimensions he had attained effectually pre-
vented him taking any exercise; and he suffered terribly
from the climate both here and in Queensland. As an
entertainer, George Eose—he was indeed e full-blown
Hose was perhaps the most signal failure that ever
visited Australia. In Sydney, especially, they wouldn t
have him at any price. Though ho was billed like a
circus, ho lectured nightly to perhaps the most beggarly
row of eapty benches ever faced by a public performer.
And yet there was much in his entertainment that was
unique in its humour, and the style of it was decidedly
novel. What killed it, however, was poor Bose s stylo
of delivery. He couldn’t stand for any length of time,
so had to be seated behind a table, and wheeze out his
monologue to the audience. There were truly some
capital jokes in Mrs. Brown. For instance, when she
goes to "Queen WlCtoria’e werry own Theatre, and
cries at the misfortunes of the heroine, a person be-
hind her in the pit growled out" Order 1" Whereupon
Mrs. Brown faces round ot him with the angry query,
•» Young man, how did you know I oome In wltn a
border ? ” This always used to get a laugh. In answer
to a letter ot sympathy respecting his want of success,
•'Arthur Sketohley" wrote to a Sydney gentle-
man ae follows!-“ It is certainly no loss a
disappointment than a surprise to me that
Mrs Brown is unappreciated here—and the snore
bo because ‘Our Boys’ appears to enjoy suchi un.
exempted popularity in your city. It is no secret to
literary men at home that Mr. Byron is indebted to
Mrs. Brown for nearly the whole of Perkyn Middle-
wick’s iokea.” Mr. Bose has produced some exceed-
ingly successful comedies in London,—all of an ultra
farcical nature, —one of which. Up in the World,
most undoubtedly suggested to Byron the motif of
•< our Boys." The plots of the two pieces are almost
identical. The most successful of the Brown series is
perhaps “ Mrs. Brown at the International Exhibition
real, a sketch which originally appeared—as did Gil-
bert’s “ Bab Ballads "in Fun. The last dramatic piece
rtrrtdnoed bv “Arthur Sfcetobley" was brought out
months ago at Leicester, ft is entitled " Craft."
Of the play the Leicester Daily Post has the follow-
We have in • Craft * the quaint drollery and
raev wit of Mrs. Brown, harnessed to the exigency of
the sensational melo-drama." Possessed of a most
gentle disposition and a generous heart, George Bose
was exceedingly popular in the social circle. One of
hU principal friends here was Sir Patrick Jennings,
and the Government House crowd stuck to him pretty
wall His benefit drew together one of the most bril-
Suit audiences ever seen in Sydney. Ptioes-lOa. and
6s But the heart was taken out of him, somehow, and
neither his Brown books nor his contributions to
journalism in Australia were above the bareet medio-
crity. He leaves, wo believe, a largo family.

that, as our correspondent “ considers the coverings

Here is a par. we wrote, but didn’t print, last
week. As the timidly eulogistic style we have adopted
of noticing theatrical performances has met with, wo
believe, some favour in religious circles, we must depre-
cate the tone adopted by our contemporary the
Australasian with regard to “ The Vagabond’s " Aus-
tralian drama (sic), “ No Mercy.” It appears that
Dampier, after ail the blow, was afraid to play the piece
for the race week; and, therefore, when he migrated to
the Bijou, it was taken off in favour of “The Green
Lanes I” Dr. Nelld cruelly remarks, on noting the
change in the programme, that it is in all probability
due to “ the anxiety of the author to prevent its being
taken down in shorthand notes having been so extreme
as to cause him to prefer that it should be withdrawn
rather than run the risk of being stolen. At any rate,
it has been withdrawn, and those wioked people whe
would have kidnapped some of it have been thwarted
in their nefarious designs.” And while writing Mel-
bourne mems., we may mention that Wallace and
Dunning have had & row with Miss Chard, and have,
therefore, put Agnes Consnelo no in the part of

The Melvdle Company are now playing Girone-
Qiroia,” at he Opera House. The caste is one of the
oompletest we have ever hai in this city. The
dresses of the ladies are pretty and the wearers divine.
Miss Melville is just as delightful as she dares to be.
If she were any deligbtfuller she would break the
hearts of the whole male audience. She is a graceful
Girofld, a glorious Qirofla. Her acting is, perhaps,
superior to her singing in this opera, but then it is an
opera of action. The best thing in the piece—the wine
song-is sung splendldly-just as we remember the
divine Emelio singing it-shall wo tell the inexorable
truth?—six years ago. And she does it with such
inimitable abandon and apparent ease that the hearer
almost begins to imagine that ho is listening to a
Bacchante. If we were allowed to use the stock
rhetoric of other dramatic critics we should say that in
this piece Miss Melville “surpasses herself. * But two
men have been killed in this office already for saying
less than this.

advantage in this we would say nothing, but e is
decidedly the hardest vowel-sound to sing. The rest
of the company pronounced the word well enough.
Mr. Beaumont, however, was vocally and otherwise
thoroughly successful. In opera boalfe ho is an artist.

Mr. Sydney Burdekin.
Mb. Sydney Burdekin, the subject of our sketch,
is a gentleman well-known throughout the city,
and in fact the whole Northern district. He is a
candidate for Macquarie Ward in the Council, and
at present eccupiea the position of representative
for Tamworth in Parliament. Mr. Burdekm
was born in Sydney in 1839, and is consequently
43 years of age. Ho received his education at Mr.
Capo’s school, and matriculated at the University
in its second year. At the termination of his Univer-
sity career, having taken the B A. degree, he was
articled to Mr. W. W. Billyard, the eminent soli-
citor of the city. Mr. Burdekm, however, had
little taste for the technicalities of the law, and at
the termination of his articled clerkship, took
charge of important pastoral properties. During
Mr. B.’s residence in the country districts, he was
frequently asked to offer himself for the repre-
sentation of the electorate in which he lived, but
declined doing so until his duties made Sydney
his fixed anode. At the election under the
new Electoral Act, Mr. Burdekm came for-
ward. was returned triumphantly, and now
enjoys the fullest confidence of his electo-
rate: Mr. Thomas Burdekm, the father of the
subject of our present sketch, arrived m the colony
about 60 years ago, carried on in the city the
business of an importer and merchant, and
acquired the Bnrdekin estate, so well-known
in the city. Mr. Sydney Burdekm has( in-
herited aU the thoroughgoing business quali-
ties and enterprise of his father. His nom
nation as an Alderman m the Municipal
Council for Macquarie Ward, has given general
satisfaction, and, if the people are true to their re-
solve to effect a radical change m our Municipal
affairs, he must be among the new men who will
enter the Council this year. [We are indebted to

DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
The other day, a gentleman who happens to be
a churchwarden attended a social evening at the
residence ot one of his neighbours. On the following
morning the local clergyman called early at his house,
and was informed by an incautious domestic that the
churchwarden, not having returned from a dance until
about 1 p.m., was very tired and had not yet unroosted.
That very afternoon the parson dropped in, told tne
Terpslohorean church officer that attending dances was
utterly incompatible not only with being a communicant
but with holding any ecclesiastical position whatever,
and exhorted him to be more circumspect in future.
On the following Sunday, tne gay churchwarden was
preached at from the pulpit, and with the rest of the con-
gregation covertly invited to attend a lecture which the
parson proposed to give on behalf of the Sabbath Oi
servanoe and Bail way Courtship Prevention Society.

The Chinaman is becoming civilized. He now
beats his horse. One day last week a Mongolian rode
up to one of the Q pubs, and asked that a feed of
corn might be given to his steed, while he (the Chiakie)
discussed Ms feed inside. Entering the stable in about
an hour’s time, John found the corn untouched, and,
seizing a batten lying near, commenced at once to
belabour his unfortunate “ moke,” apostrophising him
thusly : “ What for, Heh ? What for no eatee,
blute? Me pay pnbbly-hou two silling sickpeuny
conn—What for ? Hah k” Had some by-standers not
interfered, very little “conn” would thenceforth have
been discussed by poor Bucephalus.
“ The present Earl of Breadalbane inherited the
title and the finest seat in Scotland from a thirteenth
cousin." By Jove I There ought to be a chance for any
of ns at this rate. We know an author, who, when he
read this, began to seriously hunt up his genealogy.
First he came upon a sexton—that was rather a blow,
but he persevered. When, however, he lighted on “ a
J. P. who was active in his attention to his licensing
duties," he went away and hung himself.

At a recent land sale np West, a Durham-street
Bathurst boy, aged 14, surrounded 14 beers, and felt
rather tired after doing it. That means a beer for
every year, and so when that lad totals 80 summers
he’ll have to consume at least 80 “ swallows.” Let us
hope he will get on the Press.
Who shall say this is not a free country ? Why,

Thus The Presbyterian
Any brother, clerical or lav>:
who wishes to speak a word for
the Presbyterian, may find a
good opportunity at congrega*
tional soirees." Funny, the re-
ligious editors, ain’t they P By
the way, what is a “brother?"
Is he a fellow who slangwhangs
another minister when he gets
him in session assembled ? But
Jfo B follow the Presbyterian :
'.An/ clergyman, married or
giddy, who wishes to speak a
word for The Bulletin, may
~ a . £°°d opportunity at Syn-
odical dog-fights."
This is a solemn fact. The
venerable editor of a oertain paper
in the Northern district of New
South Wales had his attention
drawn to a native bear tn the
root of his house lately. He
mistook the animal for one of
his children, and called out:
“ Come down out of that, yon
young scoundrel—which one of
you is it that is on the house ?"
Now, if that editor's children
are so like tailless native bears
as to deceive even their father’s
eye, the fact should be commu-
nicated to young Darwin for
mention in his next book.
The following item ex-
tracted from a private letter to
a city clergyman with respect to
the progress of missionaryjwork
in the South Seas, have been
kindly forwarded to us:—“The
good missionary ship Bill Thom-
son arrived at , all safe.
She landed four cases of Bibles,
and shipped in return thirteen
casks ol cocoonut Oil and two
tons of copra. The native cate-
chists assembled the members
of the church, and examined
them before the missionaries on
board. The day was spent in
prayer. At night the people got
drunk, and next day murdered a
boat's crew. The greater part of
the natives on Purgatory Island
have received the Treweth, alao
two bundles of muskets from
some traders in return for cap-
tured slaves, who go Brisbane
way. The King has consented
to allow Brandy Joe, the native
catechist, to take up his work
here. He, however, declined to
let him take the other catechist’s
wife with him. All round the
island is converted —about two
miles inland. This is the outline
of Christian civilisation. It »
also the fringe of pestilential
Christian disorders. The markets
are very quiet. Dutch muskets
fetch two buck niggers, and am-
munition per pound three female
cooks. Bibles are fast declining,
the revised version (brand, Anier-
ican eagle) are dull at forty the
hogshead of oil."
There is a funny little paper in Bathurst called
The Eecord. Wo don't know how many weeks it hss
been running, but this is the first we have seen of it*
Well, the Becord says that there are a lot of papers,puD-
lishod in the colony that are not •• good reading *°*

The London Dispatch reports a strange suicide
in the Serpentine. A carpenter, out of work, tied him-
self to bis girl with string, and they jumped into the
water. The girl left behind her a note, saying—“ We
are poor things, of no use to ourselves or to the world."
Well, we know two “poor things” located in King,
street here who are in the same predicament. For
them to commit suicide, however, would be obviously
Unnecessary.
Peter Harkins, Esq., was found guilty of steal-
ing a purse, at the Central, and asked for a light sentence
on the ground that he had just left the police after four
years’ good service. Mr. Harkins got 235, 6d. in the
purse he appropriated ; and, in consideration of his
having served in the Force, Mr. Dillon sentenced him
to pay a fine of 20s. Peter, therefore, only made what
is vulgarly termed “ three and a tanner ” by the trans-
action. We feel this to be but a slender reward to an
ex-constable for undergoing so much temporary dis-
comfiture. Peter is evidently but an indifferent hand
at thieving; and, if he can’t do better than this, we
strongly advise him to lose no time in getting back into
the Police again.

A man got drunk in a pub. at Christchurch, and
the landlord put him out into a paddock in the blazing
sun. And he died. Not very long ago a man got drun
in a Sydney pub. The Sydney bonitace, however, con
tented himself with putting his customer out on his
head. This man didn’t die. He was only three months
or so in tne hospital, and was discharged with a loose
skull-top and a “kink” in his spine. Well, in New
Zealand the publican was severely reprimanded, "a
difficulty in coming to any positive decision being
caused by the intoxicated condition of several of the
witnesses for the defence." In Sydney, the bonifaoe
wasn’t reprimanded at all. He was simply acquitted.
Now, in which colony, we ask, has civilization (which
is always extending) advanced a hole. Eh ?
The converted ballet-girls were recently given a
grand tea-flght in Epping Forest. A clergyman took
the chair, and a number of gentlemen interested in
ballet-girls attended tho banquet. After tea, prayer
was engaged in, and subsequently,!*; “Kiss in
the ring.” In fact, the kissing seeii. o have been gene-
ral. The affair was, in short, a great success, and the
coryphdes were unanimous in saying, as 'they returned
home, each on the arm of a gentleman interested in th ■
movement, that they ware perfectly willing to bo con-
verted every year on the same terms. A crusade, has,
we believe, been since commenced amongst the pretty
milliners. When this army is thoroughly organised
and in full swing, wo should like to have a word with
the general.

At an Arohiepisoopal meeting.—Hia Grace:

or physically benefited by kissing my thumb, he can
wade in.” (All frantically wade in, and the scene closes.)

In a tram-shaken suburban thoroughfare there
is a boarding-house which is so high-toned that it in-
dignantly discards that plebeian appellation, and calls
itself the "Solace of the Swells," or some such title;
and, furthermore, it seems that the landlady has issued
an edict that evening dress at dinner shall be de rigueur.
When a proclamation to this effect was issued to the
boarders, those gentlemen were considerably exercised,
and a long consultation was held as to what was to be
done. But the more they consulted, the more chaos
reigned, and gradually the hour drew nigh for the
evening meal. Bang, at length went the gong, in came
the sonp tureec, down sat the genteel landlandy, and in
straggled the hash-oonoealera. One was dressed in the
orthodox costume all but the vest, but os ho buttoned
up his coat in front it didn’t matter much. The other
had pinned the tails of his frook-coat back, tacked
down the first four buttons of a rusty dark tweed
vest, wore pants of the same material, and had
feebly fastened round bis neok a cloudy wisp
of mosquito net. The genteel hostess saluted
her guests politely, and, biting her lips to escape
smiling, proceeded to ladle out the liquid mystery.
The dinner proceeded: both boarders ate immensely,
but still nobody else came down. Pudding having been
served, they rose, and proceeded upstairs. Ten minutes
later two more descended to the banquet. The land-
lady gave a start. They were habited in precisely the
same attire as their predecessors 1 They had their
dinner; gracefully retired j and than another two came
down in the self-same clothes. It was a quarter to
11p.m. before dinner was over; and, at the conclusion
of the meal, the servants gave notice in a body. Next
morning, the genteel landlady rescinded the ukase, and
so once more the thirty-bobbers troop into the pre-
parlour in their national costume of light coats and
paper collars: and it is about 6to 4 that ere many days
the sign of “The Solace of the Swells" will be changed
to that of “ The Haunt of the Hash-Eaters.”

The Chyobassa, it will be remembered, recently
brought out a number of immigrants to Queensland,
and from what has transpired at Rockhampton it
would seem that things on board got towards the end a
little bit mixed. It seems that the Captain, by way of
encouraging the musical tastes “of the young ladies
jn the steerage," allowed some of them to come into the
saloon and punish the piano. This, however, was
strongly objected to by a lady passenger, who, so runs
the story, was wont to amuse herself by banging the
keys fifteen hours out of the twenty-four, whereas some
of the “ young ladies in the steerage" could pick out
“ Nelly Bly " and “ The Blue Bells of Scotland " with
tolerable precision. The objection of the lady was sus-
tained, and a notice was posted in the girls’ quarters to
the effect that they would have to keep their musical
aspirations under cover until their arrival, when they
could take turn about on the Bord with their'
“missises.” It is worthy of remark that the objec-
tions to the introduction of the steerage girls into the
saloon remained entirely with the lady passengers—
none of whom, however, took an active part in the mat-
ter, until they arrived on shore. Then “ Another
Lady" writes to the Northern Argus. She says that
though young and fast men might find the presence of
the steerage young ladies an attraction, she was far
from doing so, although, doubtless, their society found
favour with the Captain, perhaps an admirer of female
beauty I She objected to the introduction of the steer-
age element as an infringement of her rights as a
salooner. The Morning Bullhtin, it seems, had taken
the part of “ the young ladies of the steerage," and
“ Another Lady " concludes her epistle in this biting
strain Since the Morning Bulletin considers
difference of station a * contemptible display* at sea, let
him set a good example on shore, and give his own do-
mestic Biddy the use of the * pianner,* when not using
it himself." This, after all, seems the most sensible
way to get out of it. But perhaps the editor-man
of the city of sin, sweat, and sorrow knows it would be
no use not to give it to her.

Extract from an English letter ; —“ During
some recent local excitement, Sir ( Australian)
was invited to stay a day or two at Lord Abergavenny's.
When he took leave of his host and hostess, he pro.
duoed from his pocket a very fine diamond ring, which
he asked her ladyship to accept. With the utmost
grace and tact she begged leave to refuse the proffered
present; bat ho persisted, with i *My lady, it is not
my eastern to depart from so hospitable a mansion
without leaving some slight token of remembrance
with the hostess.' Whereupon, as there were others
present besides Lord Abergavenny, her ladyship felt
constrained to formally accept the ring, which, bow.
ever, she returned next day with as amiable and neat a
note as could be produced by one in such a condition of
mazement."
JANE.
Let mystery no more enshroud her
Her name was Janathe scene was Chowder.
Bright gleamed the sun on point and bay.
For oh, it was a glorious day I
Green the sea—that lovely green
Which under a clear blue sky is sean I
Bach rippling wave had a snowy crest,
And the whispering wind—but imagine the rest.
We hied us from our rural bow’r.
Bold corsairs, we, at a bob an hour,
and hoisting the sail we got under way
And oil wo went "nobbling" to Chowder Bay.
Beside a bush upon the green
We saw—still 1 beating heart I—our queen I
Her dress was blue—bright blue, we think.
Adorned with ribbons, white and pink.
Her face I it was a dream, no less,
A fairy dream of loveliness.
What eyes I— You should have seen her roll
Those “ flashing windows of the soul I”
Pearls her teeth—lips ruby red,
A golden shower on her head.
A foot I—there I we defy you all
You’ve novor seen a foot so small I
And her complexion—ah, no rose
Could touch it which or blew or blows!
Alone she sat; not a soul was by
As tremulously we drew nigh ;
And then with head bared to the breeze
We softly sank on our bended knees.
«• Delicious fay of this bright dell”
(We say these soft things rather well)
" Since we have gazed on thy form fair
Our world is love—the rest is air 1
Oh, deign sweet to vouchsafe a part,
If not the whole of your dear heart ;—
Our own—oh, if you only knew.
But beats and throbs, sweet one for you.”
She turned her head ; her tresses showed
A light which made the sun grow dim:
And then she murmured—" Yon be blowed !—
I’m waiting here for Conky Jim."

Mr. Dillon considers Judge Dowling the
i n hority on dressmaking. Wo wonder who is Mr. D.’a
authority for this supposition P It isn’t a random one
surely. It not, on what is it based? To have gained
all this experience. His Honor must at one stage of his
existence—if not have flirted with a little modiste,
have—now prepare for it—at least Koo tooed to a

Thady O’Kane says, in the Nobtheen Mineb,
that the Burdekia is as full of nymphs as the Lurley-
hurg. This shocks Thadeus. He is also grieved to find
that a shore nymph got a publican's license by giving
£lO to the Hospital. Mr. O’Kane is easily grieved.
Why, what w >uld he say it we told him that in the Syd-
ney district there are On the whole, though we
don’t see why we should tell him.
Halias’s Band (Sandhurst) was ordered out of
the Domain on Sunday last, fet, a set ot gorllia-like
men and gorgon-like women, whose yells resemble the
discordant bowls of a horde of tnai dingoes, are per-
mitted weekly in the same reserve to “ gather at the
river," *’ held the fert," and " pall for the shore," to
the intense dUgust of quiet citizens, and the gratifica-
tion of tobacco-chewing, rum-soaked larrikins.
There was joy, recently at the Bum office. Mr.
Seymour " submitted ” some fish there. There is an
equal amount ot jubilation when their " attention is
c died to a pie-sample," or, en tho»e occasions when
their critical opinion is asked upon the subject of tripe.
Regarding the fate of the fish, we may remark, the
p iper is discreetly silent. We have no doubt, however,
teat the whole of it was 11 willingly inserted."
Buzzy, the editor of the Couexeb (Brisbane),
tells a story of how he gave a charity canvasser 10 bob,
and bow the man brought the money back again next
dsy, saying "that he had been superseded and was
g'dagto return all the subscriptions he had collected."
What surprises people, in all this, is not the foot ot the
oinvasser bringing back the money, bat ot fi. bee tew-
ing it. It is generally considered that Buzaoott wrote
this item in a dream.
The Geelong Advebtiseb ia now run by a
twin-brother ot Sir Boyle Koohe. In a late number, we
are told that there are "in the local gaol fifty old,
miserable, and deorepid men, really more fitted for the
inside ot an hospital for incurables than a place ot con.
fluement, with nothing to do, and plenty to eat, and
they live a life of ease, luxury, and comfort.’’ We
wonder where all the misery comes in with a life of
•• luxury and comfort I’’ The Geelong gaol Is good.
We must try to get thore.
The Nooze has at last got another grievance,
and the trams are allowed a spell whilst Alfred in-
dignantly declares " he has received complaints from
several Paddington residents ia reference to an
advertising hoarding at Messrs. Marshall's Brewery,
behind which, it is alleged, all sorts of indecencies are
committed on dark nights ’’ The “hoarding" up of
indecencies is positively sinful; or, as the Herald
would sav —"quite indiscreet," and wo have now
" sworn off ’’ Marshall's beer in eonseqnenoo.
In the capital of a colony, newly-made notorious
for mining manias and land excitement, the Banka hive
decided to stop advances and pul on the screw. One
wealthy bank official seized tbe fioodtime by coastitut-
log himself treasurer to a knowing blade of a broker,
and did a large trade ia discounting bills for sales of
shares. Now, however, the pull is all the other way,
and the flatheads are beginning to realise thaf they
lave been throwing away their money on a " pi >nt."
Up North, a drover and a mob of store wethers
were luxuriating in a station paddock, fall five miles
from a travelling-stock road, when the station super,
suddenly pounced upon him. *’ What the sanguinary
gehenna's ootflvgrations are you doing on this run?"
remanded the snper. Th j drover was not taken aback.
With great preienoe ot mind, he instantly replied,
looking earnestly at the super’s face— '* Thank God, I
h< e the face of a white man once more I’’ The super
overlooked the grass theft.
A new article in the soap line has just got to
Sydney. It is a book, each leaf of which contains in
itself sufficient soap for a good wash. Wo are awars
that this item will be of but little interest to the report-
ing community. It is a work, the leaves of which will
prove, we fear, very unattractive to these gentlemen.
Indeed, wo are disposed to think that the Church
Service is not more of a sealed book to the Mussulmans
than will be this volume to the flower of oar litterateurs.
I he importer is Mr. Baar ot Pitt-stneb, so you sea the
article will not enly be book soap, but Baar soap as
well. Hem!
The Mubeumbubeah Signal tells a story
about a oat sacking the breath of a young lady. They
" are not at liberty to mention tbe name ot the young
lady," but she awoke with jast sufficient consciousness
to throw from her breast a cat, w.iose mouth was
thrust far into hers. Oh I Why not tell ua about
how she was making doughboys on the kitchen dresser,
and yawning over her occupation, and how the oat on
the under window sill, mistaking her mouth for the
coal cellar, dived in. Nothing about how the last time
she got sick, she swallowed a Dutch choose in mistake
for a Cookie’s pill I Now, we know a young lady whose
name roe are not at liberty to mention, who—[Wo feel
this quibbling at the interesting news item of a con-

not langh;at our contemporaries.—Ep. B.]
The Czar, it is rumoured, is once more beginning
to have confidence in his people. He baa been known to
sleep on the same floor of his prison two nights in suc-
cession. If things go on like this, ha may hope, in the
course of a few years, to be able to leave off his iron-clad
singlet, and to eat something else besides eggs that he
watches the fowls lay and oooke himself with a silver
frying-pan. It is true there ie a rumour that his eight
coronation horses got poisoned the day before the
ceremony—but what of that P He had no nse for those
horses. Coronation-day he was hiding in the dnst-bin,
while his staff was sitting on the lid.
Here’s a yell from the “ Quid Sod There
are 7596 rank and file in Her Majesty’s service who can
neither road nor write. A black mark is stack opposite
their names if they are fonnl with a copy of United
la eland in their possession." The disastrous results
whioh mast spring from the fact of placing a religions
Journal like the United Ireland in the hands of 7596
soldiers who can “ neither read nor write,” are so self-
evident and terrible that we hasten to draw the atten-
tion of Sir 'Enry Parkes and the Home Government to
this cry from "United Ireland." And, by the way—
where is United Ireland P
A firm of NZ. photographers send around
circulars, in which, while “ hearing with deep regret of
the demise" of—whomever it may be, they state that the
heart can be best comforted in hie or her affliction by
possessing a life-size copy of the " dwar departed, to be
easily obtained by sending ns a oarte-de-viaite. which
we will enlarge in the highest style of art for the sum
of 255." And the enterprising artists, while remaining,
with deepest sympathy, yoar obedient and respectful
servants, naively add " this is an opportunity that may
not oocur again," Sweet solace for the widow 1
At a bush wedding, the other night, one of the
ladies, who had ridden eight miles in a very interesting
condition, became suddenly indisposed, and in an adjoin-
ing room—there were only two—gave birth to a fine boy.
Five concertinas were going at onoe, and a score of
blnohers were engaged in the mazy whirl. The young
mother sent out word that on no aooonnt were the
festivities to he interrupted, and that she could see
nioely through the crooks in the slabs how things were
going on, and also hear all the songs. Both doing well
np to dale.
The Bat of Plenty Times remonstrates with
one Mr. Madden for putting in their paper a funeral
notice of, amd ordering a coffin for, his wife when she
didn’t die. “He might," it feelingly remarks, “ have
informed ua of his error previous t j our going to press.
He did not do so, and therefore caused considerable
anxiety to the friends and acquaintances of the wife."
This is only reasonable. He might indeed. It appears,
however, he countermanded an order he bad given for a
eoffln ; and, it ie supposed thought it was no use to do
the same for the "ad.," sinea the chance of getting his
money back from a newspaper office was so exceedingly
remote.
W» read that “at the Hanley (Staffordshire)
pelice-oonrt, recently, the Bev. T. Salmon, vicar of New
Chapel, was summoned before the magistrates on a
charge of assaulting a girl by kissing her. The reverend
gentleman having paid the complainant five guineas,
the charge was withdrawn." The girl then borrowed a
pieoe of mistletoe, and taking the train to the next
township, went to the “ register orfls" and enquired
what clergyman there was that required a godly hand-
maid. In connection with this circumstance, we may
remark that the kissing of slavies by divines is on t> •
increase. And this reminds ns that in Sydney there
waa once a but, perhaps, we’d better not.
The South Lismore correspondent of the
Nobthebn Stab is a journalist entitled to mere tuan
a passing notioe. Writing to his editor, he says:—
"I believe two of the choice pieces is further designed
for a hotel and a lookup, 1 thiuk tae business will do
very well. Now, I think one of the greatest wants here
is a Government wharf, where there is so many
farmers ..." A man like this should not be allowed to
run to seed on the Richmond Biver. His voioe should
be heard in at least one of those 32 pages. And this
reminds us of a little bit in 11 A Midsummer Night’s
Dream :"—“ Theseus: I wonder if the lion bo to speak P
Demetrius ; No wonder, my lord; one lion may when so
many asses do."

AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.
CANTO I. (Continued.)
LXXAIIII.
Upon this night the Hall was decorated
And Chivalry and Beauty gathered there
(As somebody ot somewhere else has stated
I fancy Byron, though I'm not sure where)
And in the siutui Caledonians mated
Were many an eager and bnoolio pair;
And in the “ bottom " corner sat Selina
Conversing with the Second Concertina.
LXXIIT,
It was a great and annual occasion,
A Bachelors* shiveo, and every fair
Frail child of Eve had been in consultation
For miles around about the things she'd wear—
And as I’m quite an oracle on Fashion
I'll mention soma of the ehiet dresses there.
And all I'll tell you will be true and solemn
As anything in Alfred’s leading column.
LIIXV.
One lady who was " very much sought after *’
Looked something marvellous in pink and white {
One cheerful slavey, whose incessant laughter
Was helped out plentifully all the night
Whenever anyone came near or chaffed her,
Would quite demoralise a Carmelite,
And make his soul appear eternal shoddy
Beside the velvet glory of her “ body.”
xxxxvi.
One stately girl—’twas whispered the Intended
Of Sam the (Jrubber—was acknowlenged belle
(I hope the other belles won’t be oifsnded),
And was on this occasion quite a swell.
She wore her hair in tresses, which descended
And in a wealth of raven ringlets fell
U pou a masculine expanse of shoulders.
Which won idolatry from all beholders.
LXXXTII.
One dainty creature, mounting real prunellas,
Who danced quite frequently with Mudgee Dan,
And *• carried on " with lots of other fellows.
Dressed in a style admired in Teheran—
A chaste admixture ot maroons and yellows—
\nd boro a genuine two-shilling fan.
Which was the object of continued * gniver"
From Mangy Bill—a common bullock-driver ;
LXXXVIII.
0 > e lassie who came in from Peter Foley's—
A baleful squatter out at Bix.foot Creek—
And would keep ohucking conversation lollies
At Bob the Plugger, and the Lightning Btreak
(two local youths who drove their jokes of poleys
With Foley’s wool to Wagga once a week) —
Bedecked with amplitude of ribbon, looked
Delicious in book muslin—which was “ booked."
LXXXIX.
Two sister"’, done alike in French merino,
Were much admired, and danced in graceful style:
One able-bodied virgin (there could be no
Dispute about her hail in; from the Isle),
Was nice, though Susau told me she could see no
Attraction in the “ Irish orooodile '*
(The girl who is, as every true man says, a belle.
The ladies always think, a brimstone Jezebel),
xc.
One lady wore a dress—her own construction—
Of gorgeona pattern, and unstated price,
And a glass necklace, which was flat seduction,
Ar mad her glorious neok was twisted twice ;
One Eastern Houri, with a yet nnchuoked chin.
Was pure, in blue, as Dante's Beatrice j
And one looked heavenly in slatey brown.
Who oama from out sear where the eua goes down.
XCI.
One aanoy creature, who much ready Up Rare
To all the blokes, was most superbly dressed
In a grey robe, which, tight about the hip, ** gave
Much pleasure ” —(Alfred, why not take a rest ?)
—*• To all the guests," and to her ladyship, gave
A lack of wind whioh very much distressed
Her partner, when, to his eternal loss, he
Beceived her panting, from the chasset crosses,
xcil.
One damsel wore a skirt that only came to
The downward taper ot her spiral shin
(I've always held that it's a crying shame to
Draw men by stockings into deadly sin);
And in the room there was a festive dame, too,
Who, fat herself, showed conduct quite too thin—
For general ** cussed aess " you couldn’t pack her, on
The flendfol shores of ** many-caverned Acheron."
xcm.
One angel wore a print, whioh represented
A neat design of tiny rounds and squares.
And from her hair aad breath alike came scented
Ambrosial heavenly beatific aits.
Had I been single, nothing had prevented
My asking her to shire my joys and oaies s
She was a bright and joyous apparition
Most interesting—in all save condition.
iciv.
The men—of coarse yon feel small interest in
The men—-were got np in the nsual way.
Teddy the Binger was quite nicely dressed ia
A store-made coat ot ooloor a a Den-gray,
And under this he wore a calfskin vest, in
Whose pocket a vast steel-ohained timepiece lay |
And, as is usual with decided •* ringers,’*
He’d several rings of silver on hie fingers.
xcv.
The Flagger wore a rig—you couldn’t lick it—
Ot coloured moles, whioh were designed to pass
For tweeds, and might have done, but lor a ticket
Whioh showed them moles, and of the cheapest
class ;
And an elastic belt—’twas called the ” Triokett,"
Whioh showed a sculler on a field of brass;
His face, when not aroused, was red and child-like
And his back hair was long and Osoar-Wilde-like.
xcyi.
Thereat were similar in style and morals—
A baok-blook people, somewuat rude and plain j
Much given to blasphemy and bloody quarrels.
In the brief intervals of prayers for rain.
A light-weight championship with crimson laurels
Was what these youths most hungered to attain :
The proud ability, in case of ’■ scrutfmg *’
To wildly belt out their opponents’ stuffing,
XCVII.
But, here, they ware upon their best behaviour,
And, in the ballroom, smoked bat now and then.
And hardly once alluded to the Saviour,
But spoke precisely like true gentlemen;
And only said *• I’ll take my bloomin' Davey,” or
’’ 8« *elp my sivvy," whioh is nothing, whan
We see disclosures which for Hell have fitness
In our Law Courts, requiring Qot> as witness.
XCVII I.
When Harry cimo along the road that led to
“ The Formers’ Arms," he heard the cheerful sound
Of music, but his toul was sick; his head, too,
Seemed bent on making things go round and round.
So he dragged on into the bar, and said to
The mau in charge, " Here, Jimmy, here’s a pound j
I ewed you fourteen bob last Sunday—take it
And give me rum—as big as you can make it."
xctx.
Which Jimmy did, and made it something bigger
Than what they mostly give you for a sprat—
A thumping tumbler wh oh would skla a nigger.
And make him blind tnd speechless as a bat;
About the thing a Californian digger
Would polish oil, in days of Pok<ir Flat.
This Harry swallowed, after many trials.
And felt as it he’d drank tne Seven Vials.
C.
But left the bar, and went ont dcunkly hoping
That Providence would guide him to his hut;
And, as he went along thi passage, groping,
He came upon a dear wh oh was half shut.
And, never thinking he was interloping.
Nor pausing to consider *• if" or but,”
Entered a room whioh had a la-go bed in it,
On which he tumbled within half a minute.
Cl.
The room was bright and lovely to be seen, as
Our future Mansion on the golden shore:
It was, in fact, fair Susan's, and Selina’s
Slop ulster graced a nail,, behind the door.
Across the coach, where sleep should be serene as
A tired out fay's, and partly on the floor
Were strewn some pads, some artificial tresses
Of hair, some hairpins, and two week-day dresses.
cn.
List week, I said I d give the two young ladle 3
A chance to let the British public see
Tbeir muscle, but my word (whioh I'm afraid is
Like—What's-his name) Las long been up a tree.
Next week. I’ll let the light in where the shale is;
But, doing this, I promise I will be
Most staid, and write no thing to diseoncert you,
Nor bring a blush upon the cheek of Virtue.
(To be continued.)
In The A«b, the other day, the following notifi-
cation appeared under the heading o£ “ Births *”s
*• Bennib —On 30th October, at 2 Park-terra 10, Boyal
Park, Melbourne, Mrs. William Bennie of a daughter.
Late of Uddingaton, near Glasgow."
This is a piece of information which will be invaluable
to parents. Anybody who wants a nice little daughter
will now know where to got one. It would appear from
the above advertisement that new-born babes have a
previous existence at Uddingaton, near Glasgow. This
news will also be a boon to fathers with curious little
children. Instead of saying that the new little sister
came from heaven, or was found under a cabbage-leaf,
papa can exclaim, "It came from Uddingston, near
Glasgow, my dear.”
“ For services rendered in connection with the
Australian wine exhibits at the Bordeaux Exhibition,
Dr. L. L. Smith, M. de Gastello, and the Hen. James
Stewart Johnson have been decorated with the Legion
of Honour." So runs a cablegram. A man ships a few
oases of faked-up •* blend," writes letters, spouts, and
poses generally as being identified with a movement,
and is decorated with an order that, a few years back,
would only have bean given to military heroes of the
mrest water. England is not alone in its bastard dis-
ilnotions. Though the C.M.G. ribbon stinks new in
:he nostrils of every ooloaint —Australian or otherwise
—it cannot be classed at a very much lower average
than the modern badge of the French Legion of Honor.
O, shale of Napoleon 1
A gentleman, who evidently scrawls verse in the
internals of his labour in compiling a geological oat a-
logue, writes about the oomet in the Illustrated
Weekly Winding-Sheet .' Here’s what the comet says
to him—or some of it—enough, anyhow, for anyone but
a glutton:—
“ ' A message I carry and must not delay.
Hence I proceed, and forward and forward:
My mission is onward —onward and onward.
And then, as next, and thereafter I’m ordered.
Farewell then, farewell I I must speed me away—
We may meet again, hut it never.
Then for ever and ever. Farewell 1 ’ "
Te make the oomet speak like a ticket-porter is, at any
rate, pleasingly original. We could write something
like this, but not so well
** Tour message I’ll carry; I will not delay.
My fee is a tanner, a bender, a tizzy;
My mission is onward—onward and onward.
And then, as next, and thereafter I’m ordered.
Good-bye, sir, good-bye, I must speed me away;
Yon may want me again, but if nevab.
Farewell, then, f«r tvah and evah."
This, on consideration, may be in rather teo poetic a
strain for a tioket-porter; but we submit that our verse
is more likely to have been uttered by a tioket-porter
than the Shroud man's by a oomet.

A copy of the Maitland Mail has been sent
ns. It looks well j but one half is printed in Sydney.
One half of the Mercury looks as if it were printed in
Kamsohatka. Happy Maitland I
Messrs. Gibbs Shallard and Co., have just exe-
cuted a cow lot of Christmas cards—as good a sample
of artistic printing as has yet been turned ont of a
colonial printing establishment. Every card, rich and
varied though the style is, bears the stamp of Austra-
lian sentiment and idea. The flora and fauua of the
Australian are reproduced with capital effect. Thou-
sands will doubtless find their way homeward.
George Smith, alias Gordon, and goodness knows
what else, who has just been sentenced to imprisonment
for escaping from Qoulbura gaol, is one of the most re-
markable samples of the criminal class that has ever
figured in Australia. Goulburn makes the third prison
that he hns broken, he having also escaped from Ber-
rims and Parramatta In appearance, Snrth is singu-
larly unlike the ordinary burglar. He Is very tall, ard
has a gentle oast of feature. He is an extraordimrily
ingenious person, and has, daring his various set •
tences, made, surreptitiously, valuable articles of iewel-
lery, having for material only gold and silver coins, tnd
for tools a shoemaker’s awl. Havisg had a number t f
his teeth knocked ont, he during his incarceration in
Darlinghurst, stole the chief warder’s pen-knife, and
manufactured the top set of a ratellier out of t he handle.
In prison, Smith is re gar led as a kind of hero. His
daring, indeed, is equal to his meol anioal skill, and his
powers of organisation superior to either. His activity
is wonderful, and though ho has a splendid nerve, and
the strength of a tiger, he has never been convicted ef
an act of personal violence. Smith’s record is a most ex-
traordinary one. Unlike most criminals, he oonooots
and carries out all his schemes alone. His present
sentence be1s serving for breaking into and ransacking
the premises of Mr. Bonbon, of Parramatta, on the
night be escaped from the prison. A carpenter by
trade. Smith is a first-class workman. Indeed, he has
seveial trades at Lis finger’s ends But he won’t work.
He prefers the excitement of crime, and as his enter-
prises are on an extensive scale, he is invariably tracked
oy means of the goods etc., he has stolen. Many clergy-
men and others (by others, we mean unpaid philanthro-
pists) have endeavoured to bring him to a sense of the
degradation of his condition, but without avail. When
not in gaol he is continually *• a burgling," and, there-
fore, it is not difficult to predict what will be his ulti-
mate fate.
The Mischief Maker.
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
The man the most defeated, most obnoxious, and most
t he who wears adouble face, and false dishonest smile—
•che slanderer, whose lips will change a blessing to a ban.
The evil speaking, evil thinking, mischief-making man I,
How stealthily he oresps within the open, friendly door,
Aid in the name of Friendship, probes a newly hea’ed
buried scandal, or reanimates a fend
Half-dead in recollection, yet widt painful thoughts
imbued 1
How glibly from his lips drops forth the base calumnious
tj&lo
That sands the blood back to the heart, and turns the
listener pale!
With what an air of truth he'll tell the misohief-making
lie
That aggravates a strife, and breaks a bond of sympathy.
How happy is the dastard when bis venomed tongue
can rend
The harmonies existing in the breast of friend and
friend,
Or, by a covert whisper, cause a breach to come between
The trusting and the trusted where long confidence
hath been I
Of men the most detested, in his acts, and in his life,
Is he who thus suborns the truth to stir up party strife ;
’i he sly, insinuating wretch —abhorred by all his elan
The evil speaking, evil thinking, mischief making man.

body else was good-natured enough to pick the man up
and bathe his damaged face until he came to.

cultural Society’s Ground, resulting in a win for Parkin-
sm by about three yards. The distance he covered was
about 9 miles 410 yards, which, on an uphill ground,

run three races—distances, t, I. and 1 mile—in the States

Mr. Sharland, of the Derwent Rowing Club,
Hobart, has gone up the river to moke his preparations

Writes an esteemed correspondent t—“ Last
week s new arrival on tramp through this district met
a drover’s camp Just about sundown, received, as is the
wont of that hospitable but wandering tribe, a hearty
welcome t and after supper and a smoke, was accommo-
dated with a saddle tor a pillow. Next morning, whilst
washing, he remarked to his friend the drover that ho
had been disturbed at Intervals by a Scraping and rast-

and went to round up his sheep. Coming back, he mot

claiming c 1 Oh, 1 say—this is the thing that was

In ths solemn groves of Nymagee there resides

It is pleasant to see that the poet is not partial tn

he nobly overcomes) onr author brings in the names ot

[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
'Twas a winter’s night with u leaden sky.
The san had gone down in a crimson sea t
And dank and raw, in fitful gnats.
The wind came sighing mournfully
O'er the ooean dark and dread t
When a stalwart man and bronsad withal.
Of cold grey eye and silvery hair.
With echoing footsteps round and round
Slowly upollmbed the iron stair,
To the lantern over his head.
The light beam'd forth o’er the watery waste—
Blest guide on the mariner’s trackless path—
And the sea birds dash’d at the lantern pane.
As, borne by the storm In its mighty wrath,
niey sought the sheltering land j
Bat, steady and cool ’mid the thundering roar
Of the billows driven in fleoks of foam,
His thoughts were of wreck—not wreck by the sea—
Hs bitterly mused on the wreck of a home—
With hia head upon his hand.
Ho minded a night in his manhood’s prime
When all that he loved had been snatch’d away.
As ths light shat ont from a straggling b&rk
O’orwbelm’d in a rook-bound treacherous bay
With breakers under her lee,
So his beacon light had flicker’d and died—
His voyage was dark and his course unchecked.
He whisper’d her name in a smother’d sigh
As he thought—hew many more hearts are wreak d
On shore, than are ships at sea.

It was a bright and glorious day. The warm
aun, tempered by a cooling breeze, wantoned merrily
with, the sparkling wavelets off the rookbonnd coast of
Bilmaln. Little puffy gusts came rustling over
(Spectacle Island and famed Cockatoo, and catching up
the boyish hurrahs from the Vernon waifs, and notes
from the band, mingled them in musical symphony with
rippling laughter from ruby lips, and clinking of glasses,
and clashing of knives and forks on the great mail boat
moored off Long Nose Point. It was a radiant day for
an outing, and the mammoth Pacific liner, clean as a
pin and amply large, was just the place to enjoy it.
For maidens fair were smiling there,
Wh )B9 cheeks the zephyr tanned.
And music floated in the air,
And cheers came from the land.
The golden sunlight danced and shone
On feathers, flowers, and lace,
And other things that belles pat on
To give them extra grace.
For craft, like stars npon the sky.
The “ finest harbour " flecked,
With bending masts that tapered high.
And stays with bunting decked;
’Mid booming of the constant gnus,
Sped boats of every shape;
While waves flashed back a thousand suns
From the glitt’ring waterscape.
Somewhat less than 500 visitors were on the flagship
at the Balmain Regatta. Hundreds of spectators pre-
ferred rowing about in their own little craft, and
thousands of sightseers lined the shore. The Vernon
launch, which bovorsd round all day, carried its juvenile
bind, whose music sounded melodious on the water. It
cannot be said that the costumes on the Australia were
remarkable, though many were pretty, light, and taste-
ful. The fantastic sateens, which have come so quickly
into fashion, were largely worn, some showing patterns
of flowers, animals, people, or landscapes, while others
had merely unexprassive designs en them. One of
these, consisting of a white ground polonaise with large
bouquets of red flowers far apart, and an u adorekirt of
foolscap blue, kilted, and trimmed across the front with
three rows of white lace, was very stylishly made. The
daughter of a Balmain snipbuilder with aureate tresses,
in cream with blue ribbons, was accompanied by a
young companion, in chocolate polonaise and blue
underskirt, with a strikingly clear aomplexioa.
(Similarly favoured by Nature was a plump young lady,
also local, in pink oatmeal cloth with chenille fringe
and gloves to match, protected from the son by a flop
bat of the very floppiest character. Two Erskine-
street maidens were pretty; one in blue-figured
sateen with trimmings of watered ribbon; the other
in pink with turkey red streamers, immense
poke hat; both dresses much gathered, and trimmed
with white lace. The handsome daughter of a
Consul was in black silk, bonnet of snowy
lace'and feathers, and white veil. A dust-brown tassj
costume was attractive for its neat simplicity: its
blonde and blue-eyed owner for her pretty profile. Two
sateens, heliotrope and pink underskirts, were evidences
of taste shown by,two graceful Btanmoro sisters. The
family of a local bank manager was represented by
four daughters: the sister of a Balmain doctor was
tall in grey beige with pompadour trimming ; and the
daughter of a vice-president was half seen in a cream
dress, and half hidden in the recesses of a poke bat. A
lady well known behind the footlights was in black with
a peculiar flat bonnet; two fair sisters of Balmain
steamboat owners were in cool cream cashmeres, with
pnffed sleeves and skirts ; the pretty face of a lawyer’s
sister was seen bright and smiling ov*r & black satin
bodice and cloth skirl, feathered hat, also blaok ; and a
dark belle from North Shore, whose pa is in the (J.P.O.,
came in sultan satin bodice over a gray stuff skirt with
satin border round the lower part. There was not much
else conspicuous, except a niee dress of light figured
cloth and bonnet, all ficelle colour ; two p quant
damsels—in white and blaok, respectively—** playing"
a railway official with admirable skill; a mammotn gold
cross; golden buttercups on a brown straw; and a
variety of hats—and owners—utterly beyond desorip.
lion by mere words. And the "Coldstream Band" played
pleasantly.

On Thursday, about 80 guests assembled at
"Lindsay," the residence et Mr. John Macintosh,
Darling Point, for a fancy dress ball, and all seemed to
enjoy themselves. The dress of a young lady (daughter
of a civic father) as a Bussian Peasant was especially
pretty, and the lady danced well. Polly was a telle of
balls, in blue satin, whose ornaments made mnsic wher-
ever she went Other conspicuous costumes were
Patience from the Qlebe, who portrayed the oharaoter
so well that many oonoluded Patience was a virtue they
would like to possess; Highland Lassie and Queen of
Diamonds (daughters of the host); and a French
Peasant from Botany ; who all looked charming.
Among the sterner sex who assumed suitable characters
were a Highlandsr from William-street, who looked
* brawly ”; a Barrister from Darlinghnrst, who, of
course, did justice to his own suit; a Footballer,
Cricketers, Sailors, Ac., who were at a discount, though
they had the advantage of being ooo), and adding
variety to the scene. Thanks were due to the hostess,
who spared no pains to farther the enjoyment of her
guests.

Mademoiselle Charbonuet gave a pleasant
matinCa musicals on Saturday at Paling’s Booms,
assisted by her pupils and others. The audience was
large, mostly ladies, and the programme occupied more
thin three hours In the concerted pieces tae Halle-
lujah from Messiah transcribed for eighteen hands th*
(Laud Polenalie (Kucken) for eight handstand other
items, remarkably good time was kept, showing that
great oars must have been given to the training of the
pupils. Among the solos, a Rondo by Mendelssohn was
one of the bait, and Weber’s sympathetic LTuvitation
a la Value was also capitally played. Mrs. John Spencer
was warmly applauded for her singing of "Non ti
sooidadi Me," Signor Squarizi accompanying on the
violin ; and Miss Pedley was successful in her violin
solo, a Melodic by Finsuti. Mdllo. Charbonnet’s own
playing of the *'Presto in E. Op. 10" (Mendelssohn)
was brilliant as usual. At the conclusion of the concert
Mdllo. was presented with amassivo chased gold brace-
let, a gold bangle, and an elegant pair of the same
articles —these gifts all being intended to commemorate
an interesting event which is to happen in abeut a
month.

A return party was given to Mr. J. Marsdon at
Orange on the 6th in the Oddfellows’ Hall About
seventy present, a scarcity of gentlemen causing a few
wallflowers to be seen. Mrs Zulu War Thompson and
Miss Cowell as Uitnnas, and Miss E. Marsden as a
Highland Lassie, were most noticeable. A singer in
pretty pink silk divided the honours of belie with the
youugtst daughter of a Jewish merchant, who wore a
striking costume of black and cream. A trio danced
well, and an only daughter looked well, all coming
from Anson-streot. An elder sister from Sale-street
corner indulged in the carious freak of altering her
programme, oansing a lot of confusion. The guest of
the evening was attired in a handsome Highland
costume.

On Albert Edward’s Birthday the Ocean Street
Congregational Cnnrch was crowded by eager ones to
see the eldest son of a N Z. squatter linked to the
third daughter of a resident of John-street, Woollahra.
At three o’clock the bridegroom arrived and coolly took
his seat among the congregation till the fair ladv
appeared at 3.25 p.m. The bride was pretty in ivory
cashmere and satin broobe, trimmed with Breton lace
and orange blossom. Five maids wore cream nun’s
veiling, trimmed with pale blue satin and cream lace,
and forget-me-not wreaths. The mother of the bride
wore a rich brown silk and broobe, straw-coloured
bennet and glcves. A handsome drees of ficelle satin,
white j«t bonnet, and pink feathers; another richly
embroidered blaok satin; and a silver grey silk with
cream lace, were particularly nice among the guests.
A brown figured sateen was elegantly made, and looked
pretty with a white straw hat. Little girls strewed
flowers before the happy pair aa they left the church,
and tne honeymoon is to Mount Victoria and Tasmania.

Mrs. John Harris presented the shooting prizes
to the Cadets in the Town Ha'l on the evening of the
8th instant. A large number of friends were present,
the eighty-one prizes were displayed on a table, and the
youthful militaires received them from the Mayoress as
they went up to the platform. Tne youngest winner
(under 12 years of age} was the son of Mr. Clarence
Brown, of Liverpool. The winner of the Engineers’
vase gracefully took out the flowers and handed them
to Mrs, Harris. Captain Strong, the Mayor, and
Alderman Batcher, ►poke a few words, and the proceed-
ings terminated in that popular and inexpensive way ef
showing loyalty—unlimited cheering.

Messrs. Withers Brothers’ banquet on the
opening of the Boyal Arcade wrs a very big affair—over
200 at it. Compagnoni fed the multitude efficiently
the double row of tables reaching more than half way
through the serpentine thoroughfare. It was brilliantly
lighted and decorated, and a few spectators looked on
from the end gallery, and the windows above. A band
played, and speeches were short. Mr J. Withers, as
chairman, proposed the loyal toasts. In replying for
11 Parliament,'* Bir Henry Farkea gave rather a
nsefnl little disquisition on the sin of loquacity, Mr.
J. F. Burns proposed the " Hosts ” whi'-h was
responded to bv Messrs. J Withers, J.P..G. Withers,
M.P , and P. Withers, who was hap-P. Home eighteen
members stood np in response when Aldermnr Taylor
proposed the “ Parliament,” and when Mr. 8. Cook
gave " Municipal Institutioas,” about thirty repre-
sentatives acknowledged the compliment. Mr. Thomas
Bowe, architect of the Arcade, made a vigorous speech,
and gave the City Fathers two or three very severe jars
about city dirt. Mr. George Withers remembered the
" Ladies,” and thorght the I oast should be placed next
to that of the Q men, instead of at the end of the list
The “Press” was also given, and acknowledged by
Messrs. Curnow, Mackay and Haynes.

The annual ball given by a few Parramatta
bachelors, on the 9th instant, was an enjoyable affair.
Good dancers, excellent music, plenty of room, and
Mary K after’s tarts and j allies. A lovely girl from
Hurry Hills was a moat dainty Patience, her graceful
figure and pretty face being much admired, and
two orphans, in black and white, were exceed-
ingly interesting. A picturesque shepherdess,
in black and red, with a kerchief round her head, and
a crook, looked well able to follow a flock of good
walking wethers for a day. A brunette from Church-
street Sjuth was the Countes- from the last act of
Olivette. Avery little Bed Biding Hood, and a plump
Estnerelda came from Liverpool. Snow was peculiar,
but the young lady was too good a dancer to fall, and
had no time to feel 0001. Starlight was skyblue gauze,
silver stars and dewdrops—a pretty idea, well carried
out. A cream satin and India muslin dress on a
Cbnroh-street young lady was much admired. Several
handsome evening dresses were from Liverpool and
Sydney. There was nothing novel among the gentle-
men. The ball was a better success socially than
financially.
** « *
“ Florenoeville,” Moore Park, waa the scene of
a party on the 7th inet. Two daughters of the house,
in pink and white respectively (one belle), were charm-
ing ; and two sisters from Dariinghurst, a Burwood
belle in white and cardinal, and a perfect dancer from
Balmain were much observed On the 10;h a concert
and ball followed the Woodburn Begatta. Misses
Lang, Tyler, and Sheathers sang well. Fifty couple
stood np for the ball. Amcnr the best dresses were
thore of three sisters from Wyrallah; and the bdle
came from Pimlico in white The “latest noose”
from Aramso, Q., is that the editor of the local paper
has married the queen of his soul, Miss King And
another item from the north is that a well-known
publican, finding his wife too amiable in her relations
with the bank manager, kicked oat the queen of his
foull Mr. William Penney, who lately purchased
Padstow Park, entertained the employ des of Captain
Broomfield and their friends to a picnio at that place

disposed of and lots of sport reigned daring the day.

You have got hold of an uracknowledged quotation
from Joaquin Miller. The passage runs thus
" I do not question school nor creed
Of Christian, Protestant, or Priest;
I only know that creeds to me
Are but new names for mystery—
That God is God from east to east.
And more I do not know, nor care
To know, to love my neighbour well.
I take their dogmas as they tell,
Their pictures of their godly good
In garments thick with heathen blood ;
Take Hell and Heaven undanied—
But were the two placed side by tide.
Placed full before me for m> choice
As they are pictured, beat and worst.
As they are peopled—tame and bold,
The canonized, and the accursed
Who dared to think, and, thinking, speak.
And, speaking, act bold cheek to cheek—
I would in transports choose the first,
And enter Hell with lifted voice,’*
"H.E.B.”( Tour little cynicism falls short of a
mark. The circulation of The Bulletin at least
equals that of any other weekly in Australasia, and is
Increasing faster than that of all the other Sydney
weeklies combined. We do not, like some people, try
to make capital out of a fictitious issue. We invite
those interested to visit our machine-room, without
previous notice, stay as long as they like, and satisfy
themselves as to ear output. No other Sydney weekly
dare do this.
