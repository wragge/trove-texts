Butters
William Butters, Australia’s Official
Laureate, prefers to omit the William: plain
Butters is enough for him. Like Shakespeare
and “Bellerive.” If he demanded titles, he
has enough of them. lie proclaims that he
is Official Writer to the Vicereine of India;
for Lady Chelmsford has “gladly accepted”
as her personal property Butters’ “beautiful
Christmas hymn.” Thus, according to : the
poet; who has sought the advice of N.S.W.
Government House, Butters is entitled to
place three seals upon his publications, -the
British,, the Australian and the Indian. The
President of Portugal, who ought to know
a good thing when he sees it, writes that
he “deeply; appreciates” Butters’ work, and
conveys to the poet “His Excellency’s
gratitude;” It is not every poet who has
the satisfaction of earning an Excellency’s
gratitude. Another Excellency, Gerald
Strickland,- with whose judgment Edeline
Strickland concurs, tenders the advice that
in their joint opinion “the author’s works
constitute the high-water mark of Austra-
lian literature.” We have Butters’ own
printed announcement of that gubernatorial
literary criticism; and it is hopeful and
cheering for Australian literature that a
N. S. Wales Governor possesses the liter-
ary judgment' to 'decide such an important
matter for us. It is true that Butters does
not reproduce the actual words of this new
literary critic. All he permits us to know
is that “advice has been tendered” to that
effect. However, Strickland receives sup-
port from that other literary critic, William
Holman, who accepted on behalf of the Gov-
ernment of N.S.W. and the Executive of the
Anzac Committee a poem by Butters. Then
“the thanks of their Majesties, King George,
Queen Mary, Queen Alexandra, H..R.H. the
Prince of Wales, the Allies, Earl Kitchener,
the Vicereine, the Governor-Generals of
Canada, the Soudan, the Commonwealth,
Maoriland, FiehLMarshals and Admirals of
the Army and Navy are held by the writer.”
Finally the Home 1 Secretary has presented
the author’s Works to the King ; and Rear-
Admiral Patey thanks Butters for the
receipt of, .his two photographs and 500
books of his Australian poems, which have
been distributed among the whole of the
officers of the Seagoing Fleet. Before this
unanimity of literary appreciation this loyal
page makes, obeisance. There must be
genius in every word he utters.
Butters!
In real life Butters is a business man. As
Shakespeare was. His notepaper bears the
information that Butters is a General Wood-
worker and a State Contractor, Wholesale
and Retail. He informs this page that his
new spring bayonet-gun has been accepted
at Victoria Barracks for the instruction of
recruits in bayonet-fighting; and he is an
inventor of aeroplanes as well as of rimes.
V hen a man can write a poem like “Keep-
sake of Australia” in ten minutes and invent
an aeroplane, \ it is surely time -for Roderie
Quinn and “Bellerive” to put up their
shutters.
Butters!
. With some diffidence, after so many offi-
cials have graded Butters as prime quality,
tins Page ventures to consider the style and
the message of Butters. The first thing that
Butters requires of his reader, official or
civil, is a capacity for thought. Butters,
like Browning, is not easv. He is no mar-
garine. The’student of Butters has "got to
get used to Butters. His inspiration is so
impetuous that he leaves out the usual con-
necting links of speech, compelling his
thoughtful reader to supply them. In his
great poem, “Gallipoli,” he tells us that:
....oversea there dwells
S'linft, grateful, daring, springy Cub.
and inTiis splendid tribute to “Woman,” he
condenses a dozen communiques into ode
stanza:—•
Patient sufferers, maimed, outdrifting
Choked and blasted, poisoned: — Gas;
Flag Maintainers, clouds are lifting:
Always in a Crisis:■ — Thus.
Again, in the same poem, it will repay the
student painstakingly to decipher the
thought hidden in these stanzas:—
It, has come; and in that coming,
All Our Best correct is placed;
lt y has come , hut .that great booming
All Our Steel hath hardened,—Faced.
Once, from pit, from howling benches,
Empty brains demanded Flesh;
Once, in answer, Poignant Wrenches, —
Those who sought, were trapped in mesh.
Not only IS there originality of thought in
passages like these; but. it will -bf? noted,
originality of punctuation. Though
undoubtedly the punctuation of Butters
seems to make his meaning more obscure,
on patient examination it will be found
that both his bold and brilliant use of
Unexpected Capitals and his syncopated
colons are deliberately commandeered in
order to emphasise his meaning. The two
subjects might afford the proposed Butters
Society, founded on the ruins of the
Browning Society, the opportunity for much
valuable spade-work. There is no doubt
that such a society will find plenty to do;
for Butters has always something lucid and
definite to say, while iu many instances
Robert Browning, his twin-soul in deliberate
obfustication, merely stutters.
Butters!
But a poet’s claim to even official great-
ness depends on higher things than capitals
and commas : and, judged by that criterion,
Butters’ chief claim to distinction is his
superb use of simile and metaphor. Take
this noble metaphor from his noble poem on
“Nurse Cavell”:—-
Each drop still pulsates that through body
From Her Great Noble Heart forced its way
hut hath grown to a Stream Wide and
Bloody
A Red Baptism That Leadeth To-day.
And this triumphant conclusion to his
splendid tribute to “Earl Roberts, V.C.”
prints an indelible picture on the mind of
this generation :—•
When trump shall sound that wakes our
resting dead one, when gathered hosts
do stand in solemn line,
When sorting angels swift report to Head
One, Bobs rightly classed as White,
shall they define.
What a tremendous cosmic picture does
Butters call up of the Final Judgment! The
long, queue of. shivering souls, the angels
hurriedly drafting the sheep from the goats,
the cherubim orderlies flitting swiftly to
Headquarters with their interim reports,
and the happiness of the whole celestial
throng of spectators when Bobs is declared
white! No other poet could have com-
pressed that cosmic scenario into two lines
of verse.
And the chorus of the “Official Poem for
Anzac Day,” though in less lordly language,
expresses a great continent in a phrase:
It’s A Great Place, Australia, The Pick of
the Earth,
Aboriginals, snakes, only add to It’s Worth;
Whilst the flies and the heat, the dirt and
the sand,
Are matters not vital; Australia Is Grand.
There is originality, too, in a poet’s use
of homely phrase, where other laureates
v/ould regard such usage as undignified.
Take a stanza like this:—-
Just a plain set mouthed hard Endeavorer
Just a Batcher, a Ilider of men;
Just a Binder; at staunching none cleverer;
But she resteth; at Rest! do ye ken?
That last line will stir the heart of every
Scotsman. There is a subtle flattery in it:
that Australia’s Official Poet does not con-
sider the Scottish language beneath his dig-
nity even in a poem upon Nurse Cavell. In
fact, if necessary, this poet would descend
for a priceless pearl of a simile into the
gutters.
Butters!
His prose, of course, is a poet’s prose.
He lisps in Capitals because the capitals
captivate him. From the “Author’s Word
to Young Australia” we take this stirring
passage:—•
“Avoid these foreign mercenaries, for such
be the vilest of Parasites; Blowflies implanp
ing cancerous and blood-poisoning germs in
the heart and brain of the rising generation;
Foul and Horrible White-ants, gnawing in
darkness at the bases of The Pillars of
Righteousness, whereon, by the Grace of
God, Great George is set, Elect of God and
the people.”
Instinctively, when speaking of Butters,
the mind flits to a comparison with the work
of his great rival, “Bellerive.” But there
should be no envious distraction of our only
Tame or Household Poet. Each of these
outstanding literary figures of our genera-
tion has his own niche in the crate of Fame.
Butters is buttressed by the British Throne;
he is supported Tight and left by N. S. Wales
Governor Strickland, William Holman and
a vast and glittering array of admirals and
field-marshals. “Bellerive” abides by the
homely hearth, except when he has to shift.
How exquisitely that simple interior is
painted, in the direct manner of the early
Dutch masters ! Not a single bit of bravura,
not a stroke overdrawn, not a single high
light too prominent. This is an effect, so
modest, so human, so realistic, that Butters
the Magniloquent could never reach. But
there is surely room in this vast echoless
continent of ours for two masters of metre?
Each Has. a necessary* function to fulfil—
“Bellerive” to show us the poetry that sur-
rounds our homely lives, Butters to exalt
and stimulate crowned and gubernatorial
heads. Yet the versatility of Butters is so
marvellous that even in an obviously
Bellerivean subject his rival’s prestige he
flutters.
Butters.!
The Unknown.
Cronulla Beach,
near Sydney,
2/2/TG.
Age, 30 to 40.
Just one of life’s failures covered with sin;
Not entitled to wail, yours, entereth in.
B ring out those garments that winding do
cling ;
From, tongues of the hornets safe, though no
ring.
Somebody’s keepsakes golden adorn:
Somebody’s heartaches: mother’s forlorn.
Somebody prays for her, waits for her step;
Knoweth all days of her; made but one slip.
Somebody’s tares were placed in her 'Wheat;
Somebody’s shadow accomplished defeat.
Somebody kissed her, comely withal;
Somebody’s sister; Earth is His ball.
Somebody led her, as woman is led;
Somebody stained her; silence! she’s dead.
Somebody suffered, and opened the gate;
Mercy and judgment together doth mate.
Somebody gathered this outcast forlorn;
Somebody Fathered; commanded the storm.
Somebody balances scales that are wrong ;
Somebody’s cadences lead the great song.
Somebody reapeth black harvest he sowed;
Somebody’s net doth somebody hold.
Woman He made her; sinner, yet classed;
Uncover to sex, sir: Judgment is vast.
For this humble page “Bellerive” almost
suffices ; but it is a comforting thought that
in these days of stress and worry for our
rulers and premiers and admirals and field-
marshals there is solace to be found at hand
in the innumerable poems of our Official
Laureate, and that in his darkest days even
the Governor of N. S. Wales may find
happiness when to his aide he peremptorily
mutters:
“Butters!”

Australian
11 is the pathetic belief of the ingrained
pedagogue that kiddies can be taught any-
thing, if you only teach them hard enough.
Hence it is not surprising to find that John
E. Branch, Superintendent of Art Teaching
in the N.S.W. Public Instruction Dept., has
an almost sacred conviction that the Public
Instruction Dept, can not only teach its
kiddies art, but may even inspire- its school-
teachers with the divine fire of artistic
appreciation. Branch has even written a
book about it: Picture Study for High
Schools. In it he expounds the meaning of
art, illustrating his rules and definitions
with a curiously incongruo s set of common-
place examples, ranging from one of his own
pictures to “Non Angli Sed Angeli,” by
Halswelle, whoever he is, and making com-
ments and criticisms that would mildly
amuse Julian Ashton. This, of course, is as
it should be. John E. Branch was not
chosen as Superintendent of Art Teaching
because he was an artist: he gratuitously
proves this by his own painting. If he were
an artist he could not possibly be a Super-
intendent of Art Teaching: he would be top
busy creating masterpieces. And no Gov-
ernment Dept, would put up with that,
either in its employees or its boss. Govern-
ment Departments pay their employees to
work.
But apparently John E. Branch does
paint. He lias actually painted a “decora-
tive composition and color scheme to suggest
peace”; and it suggests to this page a
.Niagara-like vehemence of fury and riot
despite the obvious fact that he has con-
tormed to his own rules for painting Peace:
” hen an artist wishes to show peace and
stillness he composes his picture mainly of
upright and horizontal masses, with suffi-
cient contrast to enhance, but not to ki11....
The artist keeps in mind that his work is to
bo seen continuously and for many years
not momentarily as Nature presents her ex-
traordinary moods,” Somehow, this paae
hopes not. 6
The dreadful thing about such a compila-
tion as Picture Study for High Schools is
that its deliberate aim is to compel the
kiddie to study pictures. Not to like pic-
tures; for by the time the poor teachers
have memorised these innumerable rules
Branch even suggests that “in order not to
omit any important feature the teacher and
advanced pupils might use certain mnemo-
nics—and the children have learnt bv heart
the Life of each picture, thus:—
Look of it (Its appeal to the eye).
Intellectual interest (Appeal to the In-
tellect and Imagination).
Peeling—emotional (Appeal to the emo-
tions).
Ennobling, elevating influence.
You notice the initials spell life —by that
time any love for a picture will have
evaporated. Branch’s pamphlet will become
a text-book, to be taught to generation after
generation of innocent kiddies who might,
possibly, have been born with an instinctive
appreciation of art. And how could any
love for Lister-Lister’s picture, “The Goldeu
Splendor of the Bush,” survive the mem
rised statements that it is “a beautiful pi
ture” i it has a “strong imaginative appeal’
its emotional appeal “awakens love ant
delight” ; it has an “ennobling influence o
a refining nature”; the color scheme
“original and splendid”; the technique
“masterly, broad and strong”?
The only way to help kiddies to a
artistic sensibility is to surround them, from
infancy, with an artistic atmosphere. The
schoolrooms should be places of q U i e
reflective beauty; their desks should liav
the beauty of intelligent craftsmanship
the walls should be treated in an artist'
manner, with a few good color reproduction
of great pictures, especially of great Aus
tralian pictures, which should not be lec
tured upon or made the subject of text
books, but should- simply remain to soa
into the kiddies’ lives; the school-house
should be designed to look less like a tram
way waiting shed, and should be so plantec
about and sited that they should lit into th
landscape and not remain a sear; the schooi
books should be chastely printed and arth
tically illustrated ; no superintendent should
lie allowed to bring out books upon art thai
in their illustrations utterly omit color; th
schoolteacher should make himself a thing
of beauty, and wear beautiful boots; on
cities, our trams and our electric-light pole
should be artistic in design ; the Educatioi
Department should be a thing of etheria
loveliness, and the person of John E. Branch
a tremulous Hilder-like vision of beauty
Art cannot be taught by text-books or
ingenious mnemonics or John E. Branch
it must be left carelessly about to soak into
the receptive minds of youth.
We have had Omar Khayyam strained
through the temperament of Fitzgerald; we
have had Omar filtered through Stephen
Phillips; now we are permitted to view the
result of Omar twice removed—through the
French of J. B. Nicolas and thence through
the Australian of Francis Dyson, who in his
spare time is a produce merchant of Sussex-
street, Sydney. The result is exactly what
is to be expected, what, indeed, Francis
Dyson himself admits, “a quite different
Omar to that of Fitzgerald, not such
charming one, but one truer and more
human.” The question of the truth of this
newly-filtered Omar does not matter: to us
Omar is Omar only because so much of him
is Fitzgerald. And the new cheinically-pure
product from Sussex-street is uninteresting
because Francis Dyson lacks the personality
and the poetry of Fitzgerald. The Sonas of
Omar the Tentmaker ( William Brooks, Syd-
ney), though registered under the Pure
r oocls Act. is tasteless and insipid. The . only
excuse for such a production would be that
the translator had translated literally the
whole of the original direct from the Per-
sian, without any attempt at literary graces.
But hrancis Dyson admits having taken
some liberties with the (French) text, and
having omitted about half the Frenchman’s
version, on the ground that many of the
verses are repetitions and that the Oriental
allusions in many of the others would be
unintelligible without the addition of copious
notes. Fitzgerald’s Omar is a work of art
Simply because Fitzgerald did take liberties
with the text; and our quarrel with Francis
Dyson is simply that he is not Edward Fitz-
gerald. Ibis will be clear from a considera-
tion of a few samples :—•
With thee beside the stream, a jug of wine
And fire of Spring, a Paradise is mine.
Careless of Hope of Heaven, or threat of Hell,
bor other Paradise I’ll ne’er repine.
That blue inverted bowl we call the sky
sphinx like is ,ever silent, and in vain
VVe question it. ‘No pathway we descry.
Lord, wilt thou ever make'Life’s riddie plain?
The zephyr’s gentle breath awakes to bloom each
dormant Rose,
The nightingales rejoice to see each bud break its
repose. .
Rest thee beneath the scented shade, for like to
man they spring
From Earth to die again. Rejoice! for Time is oh

Hunting Rifles
There are more Winchester rifles used for
hunting than all other American makes com-
bined. That is because they are so generally
satisfactory. Experienced hunters know that
Winchester rifles can be depended upon
absolutely. Then, again, they are made in all
calibers and styles suitable for shooting any
kind of game. For a good, reliable rifle, one
that shoots strong and accurately, and gives
years of service, no rifle equals the Win-
chester. No need of hesitating as to which
make of hunting rifle to buy. Get a Win-
chester and you will never regret it. They are

“I certainly believe it was
Clements Tonic cheated death
from claiming me as a victim.”
“I was pronounced incurable, and sent
home by those best able to judge.”
The following letter is remarkable for its earnestness in praise of this
wonderful Medicine, which does so much good to those who are run down
with debility of the system, and whose health appears seriously impaired.
Mrs. Craft’s case is well known in the Parramatta district (N.S.W.),
where she has lived for years, and the story of her long suffering is well
known and can easily be verified. How she suffered year after year, and
how she recovered through the use of Clements Tonic, is the talk of
Granville. Read the letter that follows, and if you are ill with debility, or
suffering with weak nerves and general weakness, try the magic of this
medicine, and give yourself a chance to recover good health. As it benefited
others, so it may benefit you.

Granville, N.S.W.,
CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD. 15/4/’l6.
“I would be lacking in generosity to you and the afflicted if I
did not ask you to make known what Clements Tonic has done for
me. It may be the means of directing others to health.
“It is ten years since I first got ill, and I had a five years’ illness,
the greater part of which time I was not even able to walk about.
I was in four different hospitals, and was operated upon in one. I
know the dread of the knife played havoc on my nervous constitution,
so that I was not only weak in body but weak in nerves.
“I was pronounced an incurable, and sent home by those who
were best able to judge. Friends sat by my bedside at night-time
'expecting to see the last of me, but I certainly believe that it was
Clements Tonic cheated death from claiming me as its victim. I
have lived in the Parramatta district all my life, and it, would be
very easy »» verify my statement. Ton may usethts asyon Hnnk fit.

RHEUMATISM
Its Cause—and Cure.
Rheumatism _is caused by a curious,
poisonous acid in the blood. This acid, just
like tiny pieces of broken glass with rough
edges, settles in the joints and muscles and
causes that awful agonising pain of back-
ache, rheumatism and gout, gravel, and the
burning sensation of inflammation of the
bladder, etc.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills
strengthen the kidneys and drive the
poisonous pain-causing acid right out of the
system.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid
of the cause —the _ poisonous uric acid.
Remember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine change to
a muddy bluish color—a feature which dis-
tinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
1 ills from all others—you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing
touch on the right spot—the kidneys and
t.ie bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to
the kidneys—that is why De Witt's pills
give such amazingly quick relief —every
time. A permanent cure follows in almost
e\ ery case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
winch are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles. ■
They will cure every one-, of the above
symptoms no matter how long or how badly
you have suffered.

The Grey Road.
The road on which we met, dear one, was
grey before you came
To take my hand and let me hear the sweet-
ness of your name.
A grey road, and a lonely road; for those
I passed and met
Were episodes, and nothing more—the sort
we fain forget.
The very skies themselves were grey, the
grey that grey eyes see;
And in the night no guiding star burnt
white or red for me.
But when you joined me on the road we
saw the blue and gold;
The blossoms waited not for Spring, but
opened in the cold;
The birds, tongue-tied by Winter, flew our
wondrous way along;
There came to us the glorious boons of
sunlight and of song.
The young sap rose within the trees that
bare and brown had been,
And oh, the road we walked along assumed
the rainbow’s sheen!
You plucked the flow’rs that oped beside,
and, woman sweetly fair,
In mem’ry’s maze I still can see them
blazing in your hair!
I still can see upon your breast the roses
blushing red,
I still can feel. exrnh hot embrace that
crushed them till they bled.
Of all the roads in all the world designed
by man or God
There was no one as marvellous as that on
which we trod!
And therein, lay the tragedy—the brightness
tilled with glee
Youx- girlish heart; but Fate decreed the
long grey road for me;
A grey i“oad, and a lonely l'oad, grey ti’ees
and greyer skies;
The loneliness that lures a man, and claims
him till he dies.
And these things were my heritage; so,
dear, was I to blame
When I rebelled against the tints that with
your coming came?
I heard the gladness in the song that bubbled
from your lips;
I heard the laughter in your voice, vour
questions and your quips;
I heaid youx* la.Ugh.ter evei’ywhere; I heard
it in my dreams ;
I heard it in the scented winds and by the
crooning streams.
I saw your eyes a-shine with joy—those
dancing eyes of blue;
But it was written down by Fate I could
not laugh with you !
YT>u walk a road, I know not where • God
grant that it be glad—
God grant it re-contain for you those days
and nights we had.
May he who wins your love again (if love
like youi*s be won
Again) do other than the things I could
r . not leave undone!
Ihe bright road is the road for those who’d
bid you no good-bye—
But Fate decreed your tragedy: the erev
grey road and I! s "

In Exile.
Dusk and the lowing of kine;
A rustle of dry-dead leaves;
lhe fitful stir of a lonesome pine;
The swishing of oaten sheaves.
Patter of rain on the bark
Of a tree trunk, home of a mouse;
tiling stab through the growing dark ;
lhe whir of a covey of grouse.
Then down from the mountain peaks
Comes a draught for the parching plain •
Dach flash discloses full rills and creeks
Through the slant of the driving rain.
Quiet of calm after stress; \ *
Slowly the coming of stars;
A horse,, impatient in loneliness,
Champing at snaffle bars.
A glimpse of the moon through a pass
Silhouettes the gaunt grey firs;
A twitter as insect life in the grass
Awakens; then ground-life stirs.
(Ah’ Peace! But sometimes it sears.
that sting of the homeward thrall,
nhen memory bridges the haunting
years....
Yet somehow I love it all.)
But God ! ’Tis the end of the drouth !
Ah . the smell of the loam again;
And.. something brings back mv Land o'
the South,
1 is the smell of the gums after rain.
MAOBILAND.
MELVILIE EARL.
Joy.
To go as free as one were dead.
Released from all the loves that bind,
io have no fear of aught before
And no regret for aught behind.
But lightly, with unwearied feet,
Daylong to tread the woodland ways
' 11 til across the purpling plains
The sunset’s lifted torches blaze.
And wandering with the moon and stars
.To hear the rustling darkness press
Bight lips upon the fragrant leaves
With soft, low sighs of tenderness.
And follow down mysterious aisles
Dim, broken lights that flit and flee,
Until through murmuring branches gleams
The leaping glory of the sea.

THE CLOTHES-PEG AND THE
FRYING-PAN.
When a squad of unemployed sought out
O’Malley at Melbourne last week and re-
marked that several thousand men were
unable to get a job and things were becoming
desperate. Kink promised to see if Higgs
could find Peacock a loan. Whereupon the
unemployed wandered forth to pray for the
p.n., and incidentally read what Hughes
was talking about at Perth. And they read,
among other things, this:—
There must be preparation for what will come
after the war. When the war finished there would
be great opportunities in Australia. This great
continent must be peopled with the right kind of
men, for there was no way by which five millions
of people could hold a continent big enough to hold
a hundred millions save that those men should
increase their numbers and be ready at all times
to hold that Which they had. They were the
trustees for the future generations. They had to
carve out a destiny of which their descendants
should feel proud, and of which they need not be
ashamed... .They had a great opportunity. They
had great duties. They had great responsibilities.
But he was certain that, having begun well, they
would continue well. lie believed that every man
would realise that the life of jogging along without
anv set purpose must make way for the newer life
of doing something for each other and the country.
He was a great believer in organisation.
To the audience addressed by Hughes in
the West these observations probably had a
grateful and comforting sound ; and not with-
out reason, for the words reveal an appre-
ciation of the duties which lie before Aus-
tralian statesmanship. But to the man with
burst boots and idle hands waiting to hear
if Australia could borrow a trifle in order to
find him a job, the message from Hughes
must sound like mere wind.
The deputation of unemployed was in
itself a confession of past failure. Hiding a
gang of unemployed away behind ,a loan on
Monday is no protection against another
gang materialising on Tuesday, and the origi-
nal crowd having to lean up against a post
on Wednesday. The more politicians have
borrowed to put up fresh posts the more
frantically they have had to go on borrow-
ing. One particularly demented borrower
not long ago confessed in a burst of candor
that unless he kept hard at it the whole in-
dustrial structure would fall with “a crash
and the entire fabric of legislation go into
the ash-barrel.” That was where “jogging
along” had landed him. The truth is the
old gags about going into pawn in order to
develop the country no longer get credence
even in Backblock pubs. Practically the
whole of Australia’s borrowing has been for
just such purposes as sent O’Malley hot-
foot the other day after Higgs. It has been
done to make booms, to rope in votes,
to bribe constituencies; fit has been for the
maintenance of disorganisation.
* * * *
Of course, it would be as absurd to blame
Hughes for all the accumulated error of the
past as it would be to cheer him as a mighty
genius because he now comes along with
belated remarks about the obvious. Still his
share in the policy which he now curses has
not been inconsiderable. He was for years
a vehement foreign-trader. Now when he is
merely repeating axioms which were on the
lips of men with longer vision when he was
wandering in the gloom of CoBDEN-ism or
floating along the stream on let-it-sllde prin-
ciples, the problem is not whether these senti-
ments of his are right, but what his pro-
posals for regeneration are. The spectacle
of a community after placing a quarter of
a million of its most active men under
arms having unemployment to deal
with, and being staggered by the respon-
sibility of “finding farms” for soldiers, is
suggestive of conditions which are not going
to be banished by talk. Heaven knows there
has been enough of that. Kicking laissez-
faire is like kicking last year. It is the
formula of the new life that Australia wants
from Hughes —the policy he has that will
lead away from the shame of Australians
looking to the O’Malleys of their genera-
tion to lend an ephemeral Peacock some
cash, so that the outward evidence of scan-
dalous ineptitude may be huddled out of
sight for a day or two. If it is impossible
for the Australian people to live on what
they can produce here in Australia, then let
us know it. If it is impossible, Australia
is a unique institution and Hughes’s pas-
sionate periods are merely reverberating
blither. This paper does not believe it is
impossible. The lands and mines and work-
shops of Australia are the sources from
which the people must draw sustenance for
nation building, and they are not figments
of imagination—they are on the premises.
But does “the new life” contemplate using
them, or does it propose just doing a bit
that way and getting some more mortgage?
Do “the opportunities” contemplated include
the chance of making the Australian clothes-
peg and frying-pan? Does the tariff, come
into the scheme of incitement to arise and
awake? The time is ripe to hear something
on these practical points. The
and the frying pan are the vital questions
behind the rhetorician’s appeal..
THE DEMOCRACY’S RIGHT TO
CHOOSE ITS DICTATOR.
When the Roman Republic, in those great
and strenuous days which have left so big an
impress on the world, struck a. serious trouble
that threatened the national life, the people
elected a Dictator. In the hands of one
strong and trusted man were placed the
affairs of the whole nation. His word was
law; his actions were beyond criticism until
the trouble was past and he was either
crowned with honor or loaded with shame.
The Dictatorship and all that it implied
seemed the only way out for a democratic
people jealous of its citizen rights, yet eager
to maintain unity of action mud secrecy of
movement in the face 0/ ajbitter, watchful
and all but victorious foe. Tom Carlyle
asserts, in one of those flashes which illumine
the maze of. his rhetoric, rhapsody and inac-
curate statement, that the real ; object of
democracy is always to find the ■ ablest man
and put him in supreme control. Certainly
Roman democracy never seemed to come to
its- own so fully as when one of the big
Dictators spoke in its name or delivered a
blow backed r by its authority. 1 Latter-day
nations have occasionally adopted the old
idea with partial success: but, in the main,
modern democracy is too jealous of its rights
and privileges to give away the name of
authority, and accepts a compromise by which
somebody assumes semi-dictatorial power and
muddles through as a handcuffed despot,
with sections of the people gnashing their
teeth at him and swearing that he hds
burst the Constitution. But modern
democracy, linked as it is to undemocratic
forms and institutions, is mostly muddle and
a little more or less of the stuff makes no
serious difference in *ho sum of things. The
idea of a straight-oat Dictatorship in time
of war-stress has a lot to be Said for it,
but there- is a point at which that notion
hinges into democracy ; and if that flexible
joint is not made, the Dictatorship is death
to all free citizenship. That point is the
citizens’ free choice. If the temporary
despot is not chosen by the people and
directly invested with the power to order and
do things, he is a mere usurper and, as
such, the enemy of every free man and insti-
tution.
* * * *
The recent military raid upon the office of
the Labor Call in Melbourne and the pro-
ceedings connected with the seizure and
suppression of the manifesto of the
Inter-State Trades Union Congress may
have been justified, like the censorship
winch brings all free criticism in the
public press of Australia to an end. The
serious outlook of a Titan struggle, in which
whole races of men are graopling in the
darkness of semi-knowledge for their very
existence, is naturally responsible for a great
many things which as lesser evils may have
to be endured for the after good. If by
remaining a little longer in blank and
despairing ignorance, arid obeying blindly the
will of one politician, we make victory cer-
tain and assure the future of Australia, it
would seem to be the duty of good citizenship
to keep quiet, say nothing and leave matters
entirely in the hands of authority. But just
here the real difficulty arises. Pearce, Min-
ister for Defence, with power to. first employ
the soldiery and then to call in a censor-
ship behind which he can shelter, with his
motives unsuspected and his actions beyond
the reach of criticism, has become to all
intents and purposes a Dictator, assuming
the right to act for us and think for us.
And Australia has not raised him or anybody
else to such a position. The Dictatorship
which has been created is really therefore a
usurpation of the people’s rights; and if it
is allowed to continue democracy in this
country may as well order* its tombstone.
It is perfectly true that Pearce was
elected as a member of the Federal Parlia-
ment, and that such election carried with
it the possibility of his choice as a Minister
of the Commonwealth; but he was never
chosen by the people as a Dictator or
vested by them with those powers which,
guarded by a strict censorship, he assumes.
When he was chosen by the electors there
was never the slightest suggestion that the
public was prepared to place him in supreme
power or to hand over to him the secret
conduct of affairs which may shape the
destiny of this continent for centuries to
come. Had the Australian democracy been
asked to vote on such a question and to
place that wider control and greater states-
manship in the hands of orie mqn or a small
group of men, it is perfectly safe to say
that Pearce would not have had the
slightest chance of being selected. As
leaders of what appeared the likeliest party
in Federal politics he and King O’Malley
were well enough; but as supreme Dictators
of the policy and action of the Common-
wealth very few electors would have given
either of them a second thought. This
fact ' aggravates the usurpation of power
which alleged military necessity . has
rendered possible. To plain, ordinary
observers it would seem the duty of any
man who suddenly finds the powers of his
office extended to something like omni-
potence, and the burden of his responsibility
increased a hundredfold, to resign from a
false position and lay the whole situation
frankly before those in whose name he is
called to think and act. Had the leaders
of Federal politics come boldly before the
people and said that a virtual Dictatorship
was necessary under the war-stress, and
had the people by their votes affirmed their
full and complete trust in those leaders,
their official acts behind the screen of the
censorship would have been accepted by
everybody as performed in good faith and
with due regard to the public weal; but
when the leaders appear to be bent on
clinging to an office to which they were
never elected and increasing rather than
diminishing the arbitrary nature of their
acts and the gross darkness by which their
acts are shrouded, it is only natural that
the whole Commonwealth should look upon
them with gravest distrust and suspicion.
* * * *
If arbitrary rule and the censorship are
really military necessities, as we are
•assured they are, xlustralia’s plain course
is to follow the Roman precedent and elect
a Dictator in whom the nation has
implicit confidence. It is the only way in
which our democratic rights can be safe-
guarded. The whole future of the country
is probably at stake, and we cannot afford
to trust that future to cheap stick-in-office
politicians who have so little regard for us
that they will not even try to get a pretence
of public sanction for their usurpation of
power. If military necessity calls for the
abrogation of all our most valued citizen
rights, it is plain that it calls for a setting
- aside of the hard-and-fast letter of the Con-
stitution also. Let us, then, face the situa-
tion in the old Roman spirit, taking what
are after all the minor risks, and appoint a
Dictator who commands the respect of the
continent. Alfred Deakin is still a pos-
sible candidate for an office where his
integrity and ability would be more seen
than among the pettinesses of party poli-
tics; J. C. Watson has a record that sug-
gests the possibility of his rising to con-
siderable heights of public service; and
Bigjohn Forrest is a man who has done
, things. But whoever might be chosen, the
. pljain fact stands out conspicuously that no
selection made by the electors could land us
in a worse place than that to which we are
rapidly sliding.
OUR BABY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If the policy forced upon Papua by the Com-
mon wealth Government had been pursued
in the Commonwealth itself, Sydney would
be still a blacks’ camp and Melbourne a
patch of wind-swept sand.
The biggest war of all the ages is being
fought in Europe, largelv over the ownership
of “lands in the sun.” The world has waked
to the fact that the countries which grow
rubber and copra and cane and cotton and
butter and .sugar—everybody’s food, every-
body’s clothing, everybody’s motor tyres
—are enormously profitable. It is going
to wake after the war to a still
greater appreciation of the value of tropic
lands, where alone in the world four crops
of maize a year can be raised, and root
vegetables in quantity beyond the dreams of
farmers in temperate climes, and nourishing
fruits to feed all the armies of Europe;
where heat has never to. be bought in the
form of costly fuel and expensive heavy
clothes.
You cannot, in Australia of this century,
sit tight upon a million acres which you
don’t use and refuse your energetic neighbors
20 acres to grow cabbages for their soup.
But in Papua, if you are a more or less
cannibal nigger of filthy habits and lower-
animal intelligence, you may do what no
Australian white can dare. You may claim
the protection of the Government from your
less-or-more cannibal neighbors, accept the
Government’s gifts in times of scarcity
caused by your own idleness, pay no taxes,
refrain in every way from “doing your bit”
towards the bettering of the country, and
with it all shut up the lands you have no
desire or capacity to use from those who
wish to use them and who could use them.
It is scarcely believable, yet true, that in
Papua to-day the native stands like the
policeman before the London Mansion House,
holding up his hand and ordering where
civilisation is to stop. What he says goes.
Fifty-six fifty-sevenths of the total area
of 57 million acres odd are held by the natives
of Papua, who do not amount to more than
half a million all told. The remaining frac-
tion is all that the planters, miners aipl
settlers of every kind in the country have to
divide among them; and very much of it
is Crown land, reserved for various future
uses. Does a successful plantation need to
extend its area, does a new settler desire to
take up some waste and vacant tract of
country untouched since man descended from
monkey, the native has to be reckoned with.
Like all primitive savages, he hates the
white —never wanted him in the country any-
how; would roast and eat him if he could
to-day, as he used to 30 years ago. He has
for the superior race the hatred of ineffici-
ency for efficiency, of dead, blank laziness for
energy, of dirt and squalor for cleanliness
and decency. If he could throw every settler
and planter and trader into the sea . to-
morrow he would. As it is, the law gives
him power to block the white, man from
acquiring more land, and he rides the law
superbly over all the interests of progress
and civilisation.
Every inch of land added to any holding
is won by a long struggle. The native —
who may hold as much as several thousand
acres, almost all of it unused, for himself
and his family—will sell and won’t sell,
backs and fills and makes up and unmakes
his mind, and finally, in most cases, refuses
to part with a single rood. Nothing can be
done. The untouched forests remain un-
touched, the land that could feed thousands
feeds a few bush pigs and wallabies.
How much longer, in these times . of
increasing land values, of food-producing
areas destroyed by the million acres all over
Europe, is the Papuan native to be allowed
to block the way to the dinner table? It
is not as if the blocking process. went on
merely in the outback areas. It is in full
force within a mile of Samarai, the second
—and not very much second —town of. Papua.
Around Samarai the native population has
for years been diminishing, largely through
the deadly inertia that follows the introduc-
tion of Government-made security and peace,
when the said security and peace are not.
accompanied by any increase of industrious
habits among those it benefits. In spite of
the diminution, a mere handful of Papuans,
mostly old and crusted in savage prejudice,
hold almost the whole of the great islands,
and all the mainland except a few tiny
patches won from their clutching hands with
the greatest trouble. Not one-hundredth
part of these lands could be used by the
Papuans; not a thousandth part do they
attempt to use, except when some white man
makes application for an area, when they
burst forth into spasmodic energy for a
couple of days, and fell a few trees on a
few acres to assert their ownership. They
block the way; they intend to continue
blocking it. The white man whom they
cannot now kill at sight they can still ruin,
and they will.
Why does not the Papuan Government do
something? This is what it does. From
time to time it passes land appropriation
ordinances, conceived in a spirit of the most
liberal justice and generosity towards the
native, and asking from him not nearly so
much sacrifice as is asked from white squat-
ters in Australia; asking, indeed, only the
lands that are unused and unusable by him.
Papua does this—has done it more than once,
with the voice of the whole country behind.
And Australia —•
Australia, which didn't allow Sydney to
remain a blacks’ camp, or Melbourne a waste
of sand; which “dispersed” its own natives
—by methods best forgotten, whenever they
got in the way; which has taken all it
wanted in the roughest manner—Australia
throws the ordinance out.
Why? Because the missions of Papua rule
Papua, not the Government, and the policy
of two of the most powerful missions has
always been — Bloch ■ white settlement! At
the least warning of any movement in favor
of land appropriation, every oimce of politi-
cal influence possessed by both missions is
brought to bear in N. S. Wales and Victoria.
And it does not pay any member who wishes
to keep his seat to run counter to that
influence. Consequently a hundred small
streams converge on Melbourne, and Mel-
bourne gives the glad hand to the unclean
nigger.

Soup Nocturne.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DEDICATED TO THE CHIEF CENSOR.
When the tripe comes home to roost
And the soup is in the air;
When the Fowl of Doom is loosed
And the Waiter says, “It’s there!"
I shall see you, I shall flout you,
Though in clouds of pies you pass,
With the Kobe of Dawn about you
And the summons in your glass.
When the beaus are one-and-three,
And it’s half-past-two or more,
Bishops five shall sing to me
Where the tumbling oysters roar.
And I’ll eat them —how I’ll eat them !—
While they spin a sandy rope
And a stove of foam to heat them.
(Memo.: Push the sale of soap.)
There must be no more of this
When the pigs in clover hop.
And the half-pay serpents hiss
In Australia’s sunny shop.
Bands of Hope may go to blazes
If the vicar signs a cheque.
For religion has its phases.

Asininity Gets Another Testimonial.
N.S.W. Assembly handed Party Govern-
ment a new-mown thistle last week and
secretly hoped it would choke the wretchpd
animal. Opposition-leader Wade had felt
disturbed about Arthur Griffith, one oi
the heroes of the petrol business, being
taken back into the Ministry after his
“suspension.” Wade therefore submitted
a motion expressing disapproval of Grif-
fith, and, of course, Party rushed in and
took charge of the proceedings. The Lib.
hacks voted with Wade, the Lab. hacks voted
with Holman, and Griffith was “trium-
phantly vindicated” by a vote of the Assem-
bly on a point having nothing to do with
the motion. That is where Party gets in its
fine work. When a motion is put up by. a
member of Parliament reflecting on a Minis-
ter, the question whether there is any merit
in it immediately vanishes and the problem
becomes one of whether the partisans form-
ing the Government shall be fired and another
crowd given their jobs. Debate is a sham;
division a mockery. Shackled by Party,
Parliament is powerless to protect either
itself or the electors from the grossest abuse
of the system under which it lives. In this
particular case the vote of the Assembly no
more represents the feeling of members in
regard to Arthur Griffith than in regard
to Chidley. All it means is that followers
of Holman were agreed that to censure
Griffith would be calamitous to the party,
and the other side was solid in agreement
on that issue and anxious to achieve it. That
Parliament should have to shift a whole
Ministry before it can move one member —
that because it wanted someone else to be
Minister for Education, or Labor or some-
thing, it has to fling out the Premier or
Attorney-General or someone else whom it
•would otherwise agree should go on with
his job—is no more rational than that, if the
Legislature wanted a new law draftsman, it
should also be required to discharge the
Auditor-General, the Black Rod, the Railway
Commissioners and the Entomologist. As
an argument for Elective Ministries the
Griffith incident is quite unanswerable.
It is certain that if the Assembly voted with
free hands Griffith would have no more
chance of being elected to take Ministerial
charge of a Department of State than he has
of being made a bishop. Apart altogether
from the “suspicions which are not proofs”
encountered by Justice Pring, and putting
aside all considerations of impropriety, no
reasonable man could believe that the manner
in which, on his own testimony, Griffith
handled the petrol business was not such as
should disqualify him from any position of
administrative responsibility. He showed
himself to be a reckless inefficient and a
muddler. That, indeed, was the essence of
his defence against suggestions of having
been something worse. Now Party tells
him to come along arid muddle some more.
• T -♦
The Metal Problem, and How it Stands
Now.
No sooner had Prime Minister Hughes
touched Australia on his way back to the
second-best place he knows than somebody
whispered in his ear that his beautiful
scheme for settling the metal problem had
done worse than break down: it had proved
itself, he was told, a fraud, and a particu-
larly bad fraud from the Labor point of
view, inasmuch as it was oppressing the
small man. Hughes, of course, said he
didn’t know', but as soon as he got back to
Melbourne he would inquire; and it is as
likely as not he w r ill inquire from somebody
who will sell him a gold brick. For Hughes,
as he was warned at the time, has created a
very dangerous Trust; and Trusts have a
bad habit of having tentacles in most un-
likely places. Therefore Hughes, who was
never of a very confiding disposition, will
have to be extra-cautious now, .or he will
have his leg pulled worse than it was pulled
at the beginning of the trouble; and he
know r s now how badly that was. The whole
position with regard to the metal question
can, however, be quite easily summarised, so
that the Minister should have no difficulty
in making himself acquainted with the essen-
tials. The facts are:—
(1) Lead treatment has all been forced into two
channels, viz., Associated Smelters (Port Pirie) ;
Sulphide Corporation (Cockle Creek). They are the
only smelters that survived German competition. By
extensions to plant they are doing their best to cope
with the lead production of the country, and are
treating customers reasonably.
(2) Zinc treatment is being forced into one
channel, viz., Zinc Producers’ Association. So far,
there is practically no treatment worth speaking of.
The Port Pirie plant is being enlarged, but cannot
be counted a factor in a national sense. It will
treat in thousands of tons, whereas the country’s pro-
duction is hundreds of thousands of tons. To deal
with part of the production electrolytic plants in
Tasmania are just a bit beyond the “in contempla-
tion” stage, while Hughes’s plan is to have the
bulk of it treated in England. Zinc, therefore, is
not yet out of the problem period. Meanwhile
America and Japan are allowed to buy occasional
parcels of the concentrates.
(3) Copper treatment is confined to Wallaroo,
Hampden, Waratah, and Port Kembla. The first two are
really not customs works, but assist the latter pair,
which are essentially customs works, to take care
of the country’s production. That the returning
charges (which cover treatment and realisation
costs) have been raised is true, but (subject to what
is said hereafter) the rise is only commensurate with
increase in wages, increase in commodities, in-
creased costs of realisation (principally freights and
war risk). These amount to roughly £5 per ton of
copper. Tlie works have put up their treatment
costs by about £lO per ton. As before
the war they made practically no profit on treat-
ment, it means they are now scoring £5 per ton.
That in itself is not unreasonable for treating ores
in uncertain quantities. Taking the average ore at
10 per cent, it is 10s. per ton of ore.
But this is not the trouble which Hughes will
hear most about. In comparing pre-war conditions
with those of to-day, the rise in treatment charges
is unimportant. What is important is this: Before
the war the relative prices of copper were (say)
Standard Copper .. .. £6O 0 0 per ton.
Electrolytic Copper .. 61 10 0 „ „
Best Select Copper .. 63 0 0 „ „
With the war in progress “Best Select” (i.e., fire
refined, as at Waratah) may, so far as Australia is
concerned, be ruled out of the comparison for the
present, and the relative prices are (say):—■
Standard Copper .. £9B per ton.
Electrolytic Copper .. .. 122 „ „
The works are buying on Standard, as they did before
the war, and they may be selling on Electrolytic,
as they also did before the war. If so they now have
a disparity of £24 per ton in their favor instead
of £1 10s. What has to be settled to satisfy the
small producer is:— Are the norks selling all or any
of their copper to help the Empire at £lOO per ton,
or are they selling at £122 per ton, paying on a
£9B basis, and, mopping up the £2.) for themselves?
The smaller producers, who must sell to these people,
—they have no option under Hughes’s “solution of
the metal problem”—believe that the works are sell-
ing some at least of their output at the high rates.
And therefore they naturally say that, thanks to
Hughes, they are being robbed.
Summarised, then, the Australian base
metal position to-day is much as follows:
The Federal Government has created three
combines. One or two men are in all the
combines —lead, zinc and copper. The
Leady gentleman has not yet shown his
teeth; the Zincy person has not yet cut
them; and the Copper man looks as if he
already wants muzzling. But, because they
are inter-married, the Federal Government
may be sure that all the Metal Combines
that W. M. Hughes created will require
more than casual watching.
The Snaky Twists of Coercive Reform.
The doctrine that the end justifies the
means seems to have got a pretty solid grip
on the tender, religious conscience of Cold
Tea. Some time ago, when the Liquor Refer-
endum Act was published, the wording of a
certain clause seemed to indicate that if six
o’clock was carried licensed premises would
have to close at’ that hour, lock, stock and
barrel, even to the bathroom and the stable
yard. When such a view of the meaning of
the words was put forward, James Marion,
general secretary of the N. S. Wales Alli-
ance, at once assured the public that
nothing of the kind was intended, and that
as long as the bars were closed any other
part of the pub could be open as much as
it pleased. The fear which impelled Marion
to rush his statement out was that the
general public might not be whole-hoggers
on the six o’clock question to the extent of
cutting themselves out of a feed and a bed
after the hour indicated. However, the anti-
liquor person proved to be right. The Act
didn’t mean what it appeared to say; and
it was authoritatively given forth that as
long as the bar was shut the pub need not
be hermetically sealed after the closing hour.
Now the whole attitude of Marion and his
crowd is changed. The publicans have begun
to sell soft drinks in parts of the bungery
remote from the bar, and Marion cuts in
with this:—
It is the duty of the Government to immediately
pass legislation such as will make it illegal for the
public to be on licensed premises for the purpose of
obtaining soft drinks after 6 p.m., or using such a
plea as an excuse for their presence on licensed
premises.
As an instance of the way in which the coer-*
cionists scheme to win - their points this
would be hard to beat. They ask for sup-
port on certain grounds, and the moment
that support has been gained they turn
round and try to trick their supporters by
making their vote mean something which
they had previously assured them it never
could mean. Sane people find it hard to
believe in an alleged moral reform which
has to be secured by double-dealing and eva-
sion. Plain, honest cranks are entitled to a
hearing; but the sort of people now in
charge of the no liquor propaganda appear
to be as diplomatic as street banana-sellers
and as slippery, as hospital linoleum.

When Jimbill Ambles Home.
Concerning the N. S. Wales Amelioration
Committee; —
The care of the returned sick and wounded until
their ultimate absorption in civil occupations is a
problem which is becoming more acute with the
arrival of every hospital ship. But apart from the
difficulties of finding suitable employment for the
soldier—which in future will be the duty of the
recently-appointed Commonwealth Repatriation Com-
mittee —there is the necessity of keeping him in com-
fort till he is thus fixed up. The comparatively
handsome pay of the Australian private is found to
be' inadequate whilst Billjim is an invalid on leave
and has to find his own food and lodging, as well
in many cases as a family’s.
To deal with this matter the N. S. Wales Ameli-
oration Committee was formed as an offshoot of the
Australia Day Fund. It was furnished with £170,000,
supplemented by a State Government grant of
£BO,OOO from the National Relief Fund. So far,
about 5000 soldiers have been invalided to N. S.
Wales, and of these no less than 4000 have sought
and received assistance. The principle in the case of
single men is to make up the difference between
the military pay and £2 10s. a week; another 15s.
is allowed for married men, with ss. for each of the
first two children and 2s. 6d. for others; but addi-
tional allowances are made in special cases. So far
the Committee has expended £40,000 of the £200.000
it has in hand, and it is calculated that another
£20,000 will have to be spent before the 4000 men
at present on the books will have returned definitely
to civil life.
Clearly the trouble ahead is that, if present aver-
ages are maintained, the Committee (or whatever other
organisation may take on the job) will rapidly
deplete the present cash balance. On the £l5 per
head basis —which is the rate at which the funds are
at present being distributed —the £200,000 would
be exhausted by less than 14,000 men; and, unfor-
tunately, there is little doubt that many times that
number will need financial assistance. In the cir-
cumstances it looks as if a much more thorough
inquiry will have to be made into applications for
relief, otherwise those who have come home last,
after perhaps going through the whole campaign,
will find the door closed altogether. There is cer-
tainly the possibility of further appeals to the
public, and the Commonwealth Government is tal cing
vaguely about giving help; but it is extremely
doubtful whether further appeals will bring in suffi-
cient to give relief throughout on the present scale.
And it is even more doubtful whether appeals would
be successful after peace has been proclaimed. They
haven’t been hitherto.
Mysterious h'nts are being dropped that it
might be “desirable” to postpone next year’s
Federal elections so that the Commonwealth
Parliament “might sit continuously until the
war is over.” Associated with them is the
casual observation that the British Parlia-
ment could be asked to amend the Constitu-
tion to permit of the elections being thus
adjourned. This notion of getting the
House of Commons and the House of Lords
to put a finger into our constitutional pie
smells like cheese being toasted for a rat-
trap. The people of Australia have absolute
authority to amend the Constitution. That
power and that right form the linch pin of
Australian nationhood, and any suggestion to
tamper with it should be repudiated by every
citizen of the Commonwealth. Once let the
British Parliament be asked to supersede the
people of Australia, then how would a claim
from London to do the same thing again be
resisted? Australians have during the last
year or so had a few indications of what
politicians will do and not do in the name of
democracy and to save their bacon. Let
them watch this and get their boots ready.
“T.W.”: Here in England it isn’t “form”
to yelp at “the Dominions” now, or the
papers would be writing what their editors
are thinking about the failure of Australia
to impose conscription. One editor handed
me back some remarks on the subject with
the comment: “Of course, you are right; but
no London paper would dare to say such
things at present. After the war —perhaps.”
Hughes, when questioned for the Pall
Mall Gazette as to whether he thought
Australia had done its full whack according
to strength, sheltered behind Hilaire
Belloc’s obsolete estimate that the fighting
power of a nation should be one-tenth of its
male population. Well, Britain has, on
Asquith’s latest figures, brought to the
scratch one-fourth, Australia about one-
eighth, Maoriland less than one-tenth, and
Canada about one-thirteenth of her total
males. The Canucks are alleged to be fear-
some about two dangers, a raid by U.S.
hyphenateds and querulousness among their
own French stock, so perhaps it isn’t fair
to put them in the list. Anyway, this war
has entirely knocked out the theory of the
fighting 10 per cent., and Hughes must have
been very hard-pressed for an excuse when
he had to fall back upon it.
•
“Anzac” : I trust that Prime Minister
Hughes when in England looked into the
matter of officering transports. The practice
of the British War Office is to make the
senior officer of the troops 0.C., and he
nominates another officer who is proceeding
on service as adjutant. In Australia, how-
ever, money doesn’t matter apparently (if
we haven’t enough we can loaf on father
Bull for it), so we have had political and
other non-combatants thrown into this job of
transport officer, with another non com-
batant as adjutant, the former at £2 ss. per
diem, the latter usually at £1 Is. Every
pound we waste is a pound less to use
against the enemy; and when a man crawls
back to Australia, having given his best and
left a b'g score for others to wipe out, that
knowledge hurts.
»
Now here’s a chance at last to really do
Some good with the ; War Precaution law
which gives the Minister the right to tell
any Australian to stay at home. Edmund
Pelletier. Anglican rector of Maffra (Vie.),
is off by the Kashgar “to tour England in
the interests of the Colonial Church Society
of London” ; a community which doesn’t
howl derision and throw stale cats at any
person who now sets out on a cadging ex-
pedition to harassed England doesn’t know
what decency is. Further, any person who cir-
culates a begging bowl at such a time in the
name of Australia deserves nothing less than
cold gaol for defamation of our national
character.

Randolph Bedford writes:—
On the road to Fiji I am moved to remark upon
the Industrial Commission which the Commonwealth
is sending to the U.S. for an indefinite period on a
mission vast in its indefiniteness. I came on to it—
or On to the skirts of it —in this way. The Govern-
ment, to save its face, decided to ask the A.J.A. for
three names from which it would select a journalist
to accompany the Commission. “Here,” said I, “is
where I come in. I know Australian wants and
possessions as well as the next man. I have been in
touch with American journalism, and I have a work :
ing knowledge of the petroleum, irrigation and steel
States. Here is something big to be done; to write
in American papers of Australia, and to visualise to
Australians the things that Americans beat us in and
the way they do it. It shall be no dry bones of a
Commission —inquiring into wheat elevators when
everybody knows already that bagging is wasteful
and costly; it shall not waste its time proving the
fact that the Prote<tionist nation is efficient and the
‘far Freetrade peoples of the South slipshod and
dull-witted.” So I nominate.
The conditions of selection are that each State
branch of the Australian Journalists’ Association
shall nominate three men. These names are sub-
mitted to a Central Committee of half a dozen
reporters in Melbourne. They select three names of
the 18, and pass them on to the Government for final
selection. Well, the N. S. Wales selection included
a young chap who, I am told, was lately a junior
reporter, and I didn’t get a place. Being in Mel-
bourne I mentioned this fact to a brother by ink, and
he told me not to worry—had 1 been in the N. S.
Wales nomination I had still no chance; the job had
been cut and dried for a Melbourne reporter weeks
before the Commission was announced, and, what
mattered more, the Commission was a farce. And
that set me sniffing.
The three Commissioners nominated from Trades
Unions are to inquire into the conditions of labor
in America; and it is to be hoped that whenever they
find ca’canny they will use bad language regarding
it. The three employers are to inquire into trade and
manufacturing conditions generally ; and if they lean
to long hours and low wages, may they be for ever
accursed. So these two parallels are to look at
things from the view-point of party, and apparently
are destined never to meet.
Australia wants a new and effective tariff; and
instead of the tariff we have this absurd body of
people who know nothing in particular, and who are
being sent away ,so that the Government mav say
to any demands for Protection: “We are waiting the
report of the Commission”—the Commission that is
never likely to come to an agreement. All the evi-
dence of the Inter-State Commission goes for nothing ;
what is more vital, the overwhelming bulk of Aus-
tralian public opinion that declared for Protection
goes for nothing. At the end of six months, if the
political exigency continues or is replaced by another,
it is easy to cable the Commission—that dove among
the eagles, without any rest for the sole of her foot—
“ Keep flying; the waters are not yet off the earth.”
It looks dishonest. There may be a reason for the
indefinite postponement of the tariff. If there is, let
the Government say so: Australians are not children,
and the Government is keeping its masters in the
dark. If no reason is disclosed, then the only con-
clusion possible is that Ministers are prepared to
make any national sacrifice in order to hold the votes
of Flinders-Jane and the tariff-sinker, and so save
their own political skins.
♦
Asquith’s statement with regard to after 1
the-war trade seems to have disturbed the
CoBDEN-ite group, in spite of the -English
Prime Minister’s reiteration of the obvious
fact that he is a Freetrader. What the
CoBDEN-ite really fears, and what is making
him squirm with anticipatory horror, is the
national thought-movement; for the fact
that the Freetrade leader is forced to go
any distance at all in the direction of Pro-
tection is an indication of the strong trend
of those things which the shoddy importers
and political soap-boilers fear more than
German guns. New forces are at work, and
the battle smoke has wrought a chemical
change in the fiscal air. Those millions of
returning soldiers will have their say, and
a bigger say than Asquith or the ghost of
Cobden. It is they who will decide
whether, after thrashing Germany and shed-
ding blood to save England, they are ready
to let the country they saved sink into ruin
because of the competition of the cheaper
foreigner with the British workman. Trench
warfare is excellent political drill, the
unhappy CoBDEN-ites will find out presently.
“0.K.”: The Asquith Government has
added one more lawyer to its personnel:
Henry Duke, the newly-appointed Chief
Secretary for Ireland, is a barrister of long
standing. Asquith seems incapable of look-
ing at polities from the public point of view.
From almost the outset of the war public
opinion has declared its dissatisfaction with
the lawyer-politician. He is by training a
quibbler, a wriggler. He is ever disposed to
juggle with words and meanings. Worst of
all. the lawyer-politician who has sprung
from the law courts is a special pleader.
When circumstances compelled Asquith to
introduce a few Unionists into his discred-
ited Liberal Ministry he merely increased the
number of lawyers in it. The country called
upon him to bring men of commonsense to
his aid. Instead, he brought men of legal
sense, remaining true to his own political
principles—the lawyer-party principles which
Henry Duke, K.C., will now help to uphold.
“Ministering Akgel” from the casualty
department:—
What happened to a little boy at Manly the other
clay confirms everything in my well-known work on
“Falling off Cliffs —How to Avoid, Treatment in
Case of (with Instructions on How to Fall).” The
first thing to do on finding a little boy at the
bottom of a precipice is to discover if he is alive.
If he is, search should be made for the local ambu-
lance. This will be hidden away somewhere. Being-
satisfied that it cannot be found, return to the little
boy, and if he is still not dead carry him to a bed,
and after warning him that any statement he makes
may be used in evidence against him, ask where he
feels a pain.
Should he not reply it may be assumed that he
is unconscious. In that case the fact should be
communicated to a medical man and the boy made
comfortable till next day. The object of this is to
make certain that there shall be no hasty diagnosis.
The little boy might be suffering from internal
haemorrhage and it might not be noticed if he was
professionally looked at too soon. Also he might
be suffering from shock. People who fall off cliffs
without taking precautions frequently suffer from
shock. Shock often causes death, especially if noth-
ing is done to counteract it. And after little boys
fall off cliffs the question whether there was shock
can always be discovered post-mortem by applying
the deductive method.
The great thing to guard against is excessive
speed in diagnosis, as the exact injury may be
missed. The notion that little boys or aldermen
who are picked up unconscious on rocks underneath
cliffs are probably injured in the innards, have
fractured bones and are in a state of low vitality is
mere empiricism. The proper thing to do is to
proceed to diagnosis by a process of exclusion. Has
the little boy measles? This can be decided by
examination under the naked eye. If there are no
red spots on the epidermis it may be tentatively
concluded that he has not measles. Has he adenoids,
enlarged tonsils, blight, albuminaria, decayed denti-
tion, influenza, appendicitis, deflection of the sep-
tum, prominent ears, mumps, scarlet fever or whoop-
ing cough? Review the history of the case and .
ascertain whether the parents ever complained of
gout, pulmonary tuberculosis, rheumatism, cardiac
affections, gall stones, buzzing in the ears, loco*'
motor ataxia or obesity. By this time the light
may be fading, but if it is not and all the facts are
available and justify further exploration, an effort
should be made to discover if any legs or arms are
broken, or the skull fractured. Whatever is wrong
might at this stage be provisionally attended to on
the assumption that if there is anything else the
matter it can be located when it is found out.
In the event of it being deemed unsafe to do
anything, the proper course is to take up an
agnostic attitude and leave the patient comfortable
until further agnosticism is shown to be unjustifi-
able. This can be ascertained by ringing up to find
if he (1) has gone home or (2) is dead.

“Onq” : While the shearers are kicking up
the dust of Southern Riverina, look at the
terms _ of an 1883 shearing contract which
was signed by the manager of Aratula sta-
tion and some 18 or 20 shearers. The
shearers were _ to receive 16s. per 100 for
grown sheep, including all rams, and half
that amount for lambs. Any animal that
was not shorn to the satisfaction of the
“boss of the board” was to be raddled and
not included in the tally. Rations were to
be purchased from the station at the follow-
ing rates: Flour, £2 per bag; tea, 2s. 6d.
per pound; sugar, 6d. per pound; and meat
(mutton only), £1 per sheep. Any man
who left the shed without permission, and
was absent for 24 hours, lost all money
due to him. Anyone bringing drink to the
shed or huts was liable to a fine of £2. Men
who brought a horse on to the place (and
nearly everyone did) had to pay an agist-
ment fee of 2s. 6d. per week. Now it’s the
shearers’ turn. If they are overbearing,
who taught them? I’m not defending either
of them. Some of the men’s appeals—“to


flotor Cars of
Distinction.
The number of high-grade cars in all capital
cities of Australia which are partially or
wholly equipped with Goodyear All Weather
Treads grows astonishingly.
They constitute a fine recommendation and
advertisement on the roads for “GOOD-
YEAR.”
City and suburban road wear, with a fre-
quent run into the country, gives the tyre
a general try-out uhder all road conditions.
Some people are still so behind the times as
to affirm one tyre is as good as another, but
the rapidly-increasing sales of Goodyear
Tyres prove otherwise.
If the volume of sales were based on a lower
price it might be much less of a recommen-
dation to try them.
But why do Melbourne and Sydney sales of
Goodyears show such a marvellous increase?
It’s no secret. Use your eyes and note their
fast growing- popularity, now the good
qualities of long-wear, freedom from trouble
and service built into every Goodyear Tyre
are becoming known through usage under
Australian conditions, which, to put it
briefly, are not easy.
The man who owns the big car knows that
the Goodyear A.W.T. Tyres cannot be
beaten for service, wear and durability.
No matter what size car you own you’ll be
better served by using GOODYEAR
TYRES.
Goodyear Tyres, Tubes, Belting, Hose and Packings are now obtainable throughout Australia and N.Z.

While a Little Man Waits for Light.
Bh/ljim was busy in two places last week
—east of the Suez Canal and north of
Pozieres. In both jobs he appears to have
done what was wanted of him, and the rest
of the story was about capturing Turks and
seizing a further wide slice of German en-
trenchments. Abdul’s raiding effort looks
a rather inexplicable business and hardly
squares with the yarn that he is on the
point of falling to pieces. But it matters
little what the Turk is feeling like just now.
The main issue is at stake where it always
has been —in Flanders and on the Russian
front—and there is still no reason to expect
it to be decided except by desperate and
prolonged fighting. The Russians are push-
ing manfully on, but more slowly now; the
Franco-British troops are blasting and
bayoneting their way towards the enemy’s
vitals. But they all have a long way to
go yet. The fact that Germany is on the
defensive and Austria fairly close to the
last gasp and Bulgaria hanging in the air
and the Turk in rags affords no justification
for imagining that the end of the journey is
just round the corner. Let us remember
that tee were on the defensive for two
whole years; and if the German lost enor-
mously during that period it was because he
was on the offensive —the part we have now
to play. • Therefore men and munitions are
wanted as urgently as ever, and the hands
of the clock have nearly reached the point
at which this aspect of the matter will have
to be faced. Even the time-serving poli-
ticians are unable to avoid the inevitable,
which the recruiting figures of the last few
weeks have flung them up against. The
craters in Northern France are not going to
be held nor additional dugouts cleared by
Australians at this end wagging valiant jaws
or passing resolutions affirming their inflex-
ible determination to fling the German over
the Rhine. These things will only be accom-
plished by men trained for the job. How
are we to get them? Hughes has come
back to remark that he will follow the light
that breaks before him, no matter where it
may lead. This is at least an encourage-
ment for hoping that he intends to shortly
strike a match instead of an attitude.
The Speck’s Parliament is going to do
something for returned soldiers, after all.
Labor-member G. G. Becker, who is Austra-
lian-born, though his ancestors come from
Germany, got so annoyed at aspersions on his
loyalty that he offered to give half his land
for the benefit of returned men if some
other member would do the same. F. Bur-
bury, a Liberal who owns- or has shares in
a big area in the Midlands, took up the
challenge, so he is to give up half his sheep-
runs and w T heat country and Becker half his
dairy-farm in the North-east. Another Lib-
eral, E. F. Blyth, who has a fine farm in the
North-west, wanted to give the lot, but
finally fell into line with the others.
The United States Government’s protest
against the British “Black List” (which was
obviously justified by the resolutions of the
Paris Conference) looks like another bid
made by the Woodrow Wilson party for the
pro-German vote at the coming Presidential
election. The Government of Sam’s country
can never for 100 years to come be national
in its foreign policy—anyway, not when the
President is scheming for re election. The
trouble is that the Americans are not a
nation but a community in which, while the
British breed predominates, a number of
other breeds (especially the Hun sort) have
to be considered by the Wilson of the hour.
Under these conditions the President is the
worm of circumstance, and turns and twists
accordingly.
A moan over our wastefulness was made
by Senator Pearce at Bendigo the other day.
He said the War Munitions Committee had
found that millions of gallons of molasses,
which might be used in the making of cordite,
were run into the sea at Queensland every
year, while in two other instances the raw
material ran into the sewers, and in yet
another it was in the air. Now, awhile ago
J. 11. Butters, head of the Tasmanian Hydro-
Electric Department, knowing all about the
raw material in the air, suggested to this
very Pearce or his deputies that Australia
might make herself self-sufficing in the mat-
ter of nitrates by using hydro-electric power
to extract them, as the Huns are doing. But
he wasn’t told to go ahead and see if it could
be done; the cold reply was that the supply
of nitrates was greater than the demand.
Apparently we never shall be anything but
wasteful until we clear out some of the dull
incompetents who now rule our affairs.

nothing could go much amiss for long in a
district presided over by a Duncan and a
Parson, the latter armed with good words
and the former with the family axe. The
Bert Bailey specialists have moved about a

Bailey McClure that he may lose his gradual

Laura Roberts is natural as the McClure

very cheerful and well worth seeing for its
Australian characterisation and atmosphere.

* Apparently Sydney Criterion is to relapse
from the delightful comedy of “The Boom-
erang” into American farce once more. On
Saturday “Too Many Cooks” is to be pro-
duced. The chief attraction seems to be a
bit of house-building on the stage. But
apparently not for a returned soldier.
Hoyt’s, the front-rank Melbourne picture
people, having taken over and remodelled
the Sydney Colonial Theatre (in George-
street below Bathurst-street), will set the
film-spools unwinding 2j miles of drama and
comedy on Saturday. The show is to be a
continuous one, and will include some ex-
clusive Wm. Fox and Metro photo plays.
“Blazing Love,” tempered by some splendid
Arctic scenery, and “The Yellow Passport.”
starring the film-beauty Clara Kimball
Young, are to be the opening features.
The Strollers are settling down at the
Sydney Palace to wreck their previous big
record. Since they opened on July 22 they
have given 22 performances, and 22 times
the treasurer has had a great love for
Sydney’s pious community glittering in one
eye and a calculation of its resources shining
out of the other. '
Illusionist Horace Goldin has pumped
some fresh mystery into his long show at
Sydney Tivoli, so the theatre Sherlocks wdio
think they have seen through the old goods
can now go along and do some more detect-
ing. Jack and Foris, a comedy hand-balanc-
ing pair, arrived on Saturday. The sober
half of the team saves the drunken half
from 47 severe falls, and a pair of trousers
that seem to be ripped prove to be intact.
After that it is the turn of baritone Basle
and partner Vivi, or of Grace Hanson, a
Murkan mezzo-soprano. Floyd Mack and
Mabelle, Jimmy Fletcher, Gosward and the
grave Os-ko-mon are the other artists who
keep the orchestra working.
“Carmen.” produced at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s on three nights last week, was weak-
est in the title role. Miss Russ lacks the
animal magnetism which Merimde’s gaudy
heroine should have. She plays Carmen in
a flirtatious but unsensational fashion, as if
she wanted to restore the reputation of a
hussy who had been slandered by Emma
Calve and other rorty performers of the part.
She is at her best in the Habanera and
Seguidilla of the ‘first act, though her palpi-
tating mezzo prevents her giving those highly-
colored items their full measure of enchant-
ment. Cappelli, the Don Jos6 of the first
two nights, is vocally distinguished, but
dramatically he is a diffident canoodler in
comparison with Balboni, who officiated on
Saturday. Cappelli seems to conclude that
a dishevelled passion is not in keeping with
a clean shave and an irreproachable uniform.
It is only in the last act, when he has evi-
dently dodged the barber for several days,
that he shows the devil that is lurking within
him and makes the suppliant lover and homi-
cide a fairly tempestuous character. Bal-
boni, on the other hand, is consistent through-
out. At the outset his polite amazement at
Carmen’s coquetry is excellently depicted,
and his final encounter with the lady, when
he is alternately pleading and threatening
in quivering tenor tones, surpasses Cappelii’s
performance in earnestness and lire. Sca-
muzzi, as Escamillo, lets the audience know
that he has been specially chosen by Provi-
dence to act as a heart-tonic to the gypsy
female. He looks a valiant bull-slayer and
sings with abandon, though the principal
effort—the Toreador’s Song—is a bit too low
for his hearty baritone. Miss Visoni sings
and acts with maidenly tenderness as
Micaela, and Mrs. Piccolo (Mercedes) is
strong enough to conceal the feebleness of
Mrs. Belloni (Frasquita) in their card duet.
The vast bulk of Cesaroni towers in the
uniform of Captain Zuniga, and his moderate
baritone is just about equal to the scraps of
recitative that fall to his lot. The scenery
deserves a word of approval, and the bright
flappers, who dance in Act IV. as a sort of
overture to the tragedy of the evening, put
plenty of enthusiasm into their work. The
chorus, somewhat careless and perfunctory on
the opening night, had improved sufficiently
on Saturday to earn a Distinguished Conduct
medal. Butterfly,” staged on Monday, and
“Boheme,” to happen to-morrow, are sharing
the attention of first-nighters this week.

“The Story of the Rosary” at Melbourne
Royal is blatant bellowdrama of the sort
that burst into vogue after “The Prisoner
of Zenda” was invented. It came as a cor-
rective to the earlier Blandholtian melo-
drama, where the hero was falsely accused
of stealing the papers, and the comic relief
used to bring its frugal supper to its ’umble
’ome in a basket. It is the gilded sort of
bellowdrama of which Bill Anderson’s “The
Prince and the Beggar Maid” was easily
the best specimen.
* * # *
The scene is laid in some comic-opera
country known as Seltzer, and all the char-
acters are connected with the Court, the
Army or the Church. There are two heroes
(Harvey and Willoughby), and a non-
criminal villain (S. Scanlan) announces
himself with a prodigious scowl. Seanlan’s
evil temperament is apparent to everybody
except Harvey, who calls him “dear old
Philip” and slaps him on the back instead
of punching him on the nose. At last, owing
to his blighted affection for Princess Venetia
(Madge Fabian), dear old Philip gets sick
of being civil to the heroes or to anybody
else. He lent a lot of money to the
Princess’s father, on the understanding that
he was to marry the girl, but the Princess
prefers the other fellow, and when her royal
stonebroke parent casts her penniless upon
the cold world she goes with Harvey to a
convent chapel where the monk from next
door holds up his hands and makes ’em
man and wife. Marriage in a registrar’s is
a long and difficult operation compared with
these lightning nuptials in the convent
chapel. Sidney Stirling, by the way, is the
preposterous priest from next door. Imme-
diately after the marriage Harvey goes to
lead the Seltzogene forces against the King-
dom of Apollinaris. He wins the war within
three months, but then he has the bad luck
to be carried away for dead by the Enemy,
who sends him into captivity (although
peace is declared) at Apenta—looo miles
up country—where he works in the terrible
Glaube Saltz Mines. His decease _is
announced to his royal soouse by friend
Willoughby, but the corpse escapes from the
living death in time to prevent his princess
from taking the veil.

The dainty brightness of Beatrice
Holloway is “The Rosary’s” redeeming
feature, and Kay Souper, Cornell and
Champney do their best for it. Also the
scenery deserves great praise, and the prin-
cipals first mentioned are to be commended
for acting as though they took themselves 1
seriously. The acting, in fact, is an earnest
apology for the play, and the good looks of
ladies Fabian. Holloway and Burroughs
compel favorable notice.
“THE GEISHA.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The merry melodies of old,
The careless jests of yesterday,
Are weighted now with Mern’ry s gold
And dear as friends grown old and grey;
We thoughtful sit and watch the. play
That made us laugh ere Time began
To steal our dearest ones away.
“The Geisha” flirts her faded fan.
The music beats! Grave dreams unfold,
And we beyond, the foyer stray;
So much has passed since first they rolled
The drums and made the trumpets bray.
A childish set of tricks! But, stay 1
There is some new thing in the plan—
An echo of past joyance, say.
“The Geisha” flirts her faded fan.
With gestures quaint the tale is told
That cheered us once. We can but pray
That ere the dawn gleams stark and cold
And mocks the dancing lanterns gay,
We shall steal out, as old friends may,
And find her there in old Japan
Who laughed and sang like any fay.
“The Geisha” flirts her faded fan.

at Her Majesty’s (Melb.), but the actual
last night is not any night this week.

At Melbourne King’s the arrival of “Peg
o’ my Heart” continues to be a fortunate
thing for the incredible Chichester family.
As a boarder she is worth £B3 6s. Sd. a
month. Incidentally, she saves icicle Ethel
from eloping with a most undesirable mar-
ried man.- Moreover, she is the luck-
bringer who causes a busted bank to resume
business as before. Whether she proves, a
fortunate thing for young-man Jerry is quite
another question.

This Thursday is a day of farewells at
Melbourne Auditorium. In the afternoon
Evelyn Scotney and Howard White will
give an extra and absolutely-last concert,
under instructions from General Desire. In
the evening a final Mirovitch-Piastro recital
will possibly incite the General to demand
that the Russian artists shall appear again
with an orchestra at the back of them.
Last Saturday they were associated with
Prof. Laver’s musicians in Sneezowsky con-
certos, and the audience made a joyful noise
for five minutes after each item.
Some unruly passions sizzled in “Love’s
Crucible,” one of the pictures at Hoyt’s
Theatres, Melbourne, last Saturday. It is
a sad study of an amorous youth whose suc-
cesses with the ladies would make Casanova
green with envy. Even a prim and proper
Miss, who goes to Noo Yark to study art,
falls into his arms at the first encounter and
sacrifices her future for the brief pleasure
of a Past. She eventually goes home to
mother and forgets her indiscretion in a
suddenly-discovered affection for a yokel
admirer, whilst the author of her trouble is
shooed out of the film, cowering under the
just scorn of his enraged relations. The
most sensational of the other yarns screened
is “Tables Turned,” a five-reel shudder by
the Metro firm.
** * *
Ray Monde, an impersonator of females,
who arrived at Melbourne Bijou on Satur-
day,. is more successful than most in main-
taining the illusion of femininity. His small
hands and . feet and girlishly-modelled coun-
tenance, aided by two or three wigs and
elaborate dressing, make the deception prac-
tically perfect. It is when he opens his
mouth, alternately warbling in a natural
bax-itone and a patently artificial contralto,
that doubts about his sex are set at rest.
Vernon and Reid are new balancers and
dancers in the first part of the bill, and the
Robert Demont Trio, a lively team of somer-
saulters, also got busy for the first time on
Saturday. Two others, who dropped in
during, the week-end, are Mendal and Nagel,
a violinist and accoi’dionist, whose well-
meant efforts bring back memories of a
push picnic that was attended by a red-
headed giii and a nest of offensive ants.
“A NIGHT IN A HAREM,” AT SYDNEY
ADELPHI.
Sailor Sweeney (Lew Dunbar) and Sailor
Cohen (Murray Simons) find their way into
the Adelphi Harem.
The turn of the Diek and Dorothy Co.
looks exciting in comparison with the other
acts at Melbourne Tivoli, though it is merely
a passable dancing exhibition by an energetic
flapper and two male accomplices. The trio
apparently belong to the tango and hug-me-
tight school of posturing, but occasionally
they break into a simultaneous step-dance,
whilst one of the gents throws himself about
in an eccentric performance. Another addi-
tion on Saturday was a fiddler, Keith Ken-
nedy, whom the management proudly bills
as a “classical violinist.” The rest of the
show is generally so feeble that only the
presence of Mennetti and Sidelli and Marie
Iving-Scott saves it from collapse.
In Adelaide the Appendreena Society has
revived the old “Passport.” Percy Trevor
produced it, and his clever wife played the
forgetful heroine —Mrs. Brough’s old part.
The usual capable lot of Appendreena ama-
teurs were in support, and among the new
recruits the most striking were Beg Jacobs
and a Trevor daughter. At the Majestic,

ing up the bill; and, at the Queen’s, Dam-
pier’s lot of Dandies are steadily convincing
Adelaide that this kind of show need not
necessarily be outdoors, Brandon Cremer’s
dramatic co. has moved on to Broken Hill,
leaving the Tivoli closed for a bit, and the
King’s, with the Fuller Go., once, again
has a monopoly in drama. As for the pic-
ture houses, they find that players attract
better than plays. Thus, at the Royal are
starred Walsh and Bosworth and Doris
Pawn; at Wondergraph, Blanche Sweet,
Marguerite Clark and Hazel Dawn; at
West’s, Bessie Barriscale, the boy Collier
and the everlasting Chaplin. But W. M.
Hughes took all the limelight—Town Hall,
Trades Hall, Exhibition, and so on, in
steady sequence—during his two days in
Adelaide.
The Australian branch of the World’s
Workers, the association that promotes a
policy of industrial slacking, wants an
emblem. What is the matter with the sloe?
Westralian Laborites dropped a bomb
into the new Liberal Government camp by
the announcement that ex-Premier Scaddan
would resign his Goldfields pocket borough
and run against Attorney-General Robinson
for Canning, a suburban constituency which
wobbles between Liberalism and Laborism.
Robinson, King’s Counsel and keen commer-
cial man, is the weakest horse of the team:
he lacks personal popularity and has been
a conspicuous failure in the House during
his two years there. “Jack,” on the other
hand, is a good man in a fight, avd Robinson
will have the battle of his life.
Tasmanian Railway Minister Propsting
has turned down the proposal that the
Railway Commissioner should be transferred
from Hobart to Launceston as the first move
in the capital-shifting campaign which is
now on. Of course, being a politician, he
has thrown out a sop, appointing a: district
traffic-manager to attend to things in the
North. But naturally that doesn’t satisfy
the Launceston people. It is getting very
clear now that if the capital-changing busi-
ness is pushed it will burst up the mberal
party, which is pretty shaky, anyway, with
W. H. Burgess on the warpath against the
Premier. So the capital is likely to stay
where it is.
Aided by the Argus, the new Vic.
Farmers’ Union continues to comb the coun-
try for disaffected Liberals and enrol them.
There isn’t much comfort for the farmer in
the various Liberal platforms—those of the
People’s Party, the People’s Liberal Party,
the A.W.N.L., and the Australian Liberal
Union. In none of them is there any direct
reference to Cocky. The nearest approach
to a Liberal declaration against the commis-
sion-shark and the land-leech is the ex-
pressed intention of the A.L.U. “to main-
tain the right of all men and women to enjoy
the fruits of their thrift and industry.” An
equally beautiful and strangely similar plank
has been part of the Federal Labor party’s
platform for years—“the securing of the full
results of their industry to all producers.”
But a co-operative ' concern to supply him
with cheaper manure might be worth twice
the money.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“T.W.”: John Coates, the tall Yorkshire-
man who played heroic tenor rOles in grand
opera through Australia some years back,
is now doing the heroic properly with a
captain’s stars on his shoulders. The irony
ox it is that John used to be even better-
appreciated by the Hun opera-lover than he
was in his own country.
From Canada comes news of the death of
Professor Michel Hambourg, parent of Mark
and brothers Boris, the ’celloist, and Jakoff,
the fiddler. The family migrated from the
Fog to Toronto six or seven years ago, and
old man Hambourg, a far better-looking man
than any of his musical progeny, set up a
prosperous Conservatoire there. When
Mark w r as in the first flush of his fame three
Hambourg generations dwelt together in
Elgin Avenue, London, where budding talent
of the musical variety used to resort and
have its chop. The furthest-back generation
was a typical Polisli-Hebraic couple who had
to be discreetly hidden somewhere below
stairs on days when the countesses came
along to pay homage. But papa Michel was
quite ornamental, and mixed well with the
aristocratic elements.
Charlie MacMahon, one of the best-known
of the old school of Australian managers, is
going on the road again with his own co.
“Lady Godiva” is to be the first card.
One of the most interesting experiments
in Australian play-production goes to the
credit of Beaumont Smith. He has drama-
tised Henry Lawson’s “While the Billy
Boils,” ar.d will stage it at the Palace
(Sydney) shortly.
“Fax”: The growing success of Evelyn
Scotney and Howard White is only partly
explained by their singing. The lady,
although accomplished, is not a specially-
charming soprano. There is still a slight
roughness on the surface of her voice, and her
high notes are a trifle hard and shrill. As
for Howard White, he has no pretensions to
rival Peter Dawson or any of the best. But
he gets on familiar terms with the audience
by talking about the songs, and in a tall, up-
standing manner he sings quaint ditties that
David Bispham, his model, sang on the same
platform three years ago. The appearance of
Evelyn Scotney does the rest. In her short
white frock she might be mistaken for a
ballet girl if her deportment were not strik-
ingly unaffected. She is the typical Aus-
tralian girl Parisianised. The other girls
just love her; and the matrimonial relation-
ship between the pqir seems to score as it
scored with Butt and Rumford. They are
capital showfolk as well as singers. Howard
White completes their capture of the audi-
ence by playing with a very common-place
skill a ’cello obligato to one of his wife’s
songs, which is very sweet and husbandly,
you know. They are going to do well round
this country.
Robert Harper, otherwise Julius Roscius,
who used to sing “The Regular Army Man”
in “Autumn Manoeuvres,” is now a sergeant
in the A.I.F. He was lately cast for the
part of n.c.o. in charge of a clearing gang
at one of the Enoggera (Q.) camps.
Hamish McCunn, who died the other day
in London, might well have taken the high-
est rank as a composer if in his youth < lie
was only 48 at his death) he had not been
discouraged by professors and conductors
who at that time thought that no noises that
weren’t made in Germany and other foreign
parts were respectable. When McCunn com-
posed his remarkable orchestral suite. “Land
of the Mountain and the Flood,” he was
but a little over 20, and he was still in the
twenties when he had an opera (libretto by
the Marquis of Lorne) produced at Covent
Garden. In spite of these achievements his
work was allowed to languish; so McCunn,
like many another British composer, took to
the stuff that bought bread and butter, con-
ducting and writing “additional numbers”
for such works of art as “The Earl and the
Girl.” Hamish’s surviving brother, Andrew,
is well known in Australia as conductor for
the Williamson firm.
“Glen H.”: When the Gonsalez season
finishes George Marlow ceases to be director
of George Marlow, Ltd., and goes with his
w-ife (Ethel Buckley) for a two-years’ tour
of the Cold Country and that part of the
Continent which has not been ripped up by
shell fire. The Fullers, with Ben J. as gov-
erning director, take over the Princess’s
(Melb.) and Adelphi (Sydney).
“0.K.”: In the Gonsalez Co.’s latest
“Pagliacci” matinee there was a remarkable
change from previous performances of the
same little opera. The tenor only was
changed, but the difference between Balboni
and Dagradi altered the tone of the tragedy.
The rather beauteous Dagradi, tall, slim and
smileless, was a promise of trouble in store
from the moment of his entrance. His rather
harsh voice had a threat in it. He seemed to
suspect his demure Nedda on some previous
evidence of her giddiness. Balboni, on the
other hand, is a plump, jolly fellow. He is a
Pagliacci who enjoys his job. When he sings
of his capacity for jealousy he is -trans-
formed, whereas Dagradi was a gloomy
young hubby all the time. In the pantomime
scene Balboni starts to play his part merrily.
Then jealousy obsesses him, and he goes
quietly mad. He is pathetic in his rage, and
the effect of his murderous attack on his wife
and her lover is tragic in the last degree.
The sympathy of the congregation goes out to
this suddenly-demented jolly man. But when
Dagradi played the part morosely and un-
melodiously his wife got all the sympathy.
In spite of the amusement tax Adelaide is
to have still another picture-theatre, to be
built at once on the Norfolk Arms site in
Bundle-street. This is very near where
the Academy of Music used to stand years
ago; but at present there is no theatre within
100 yards, hence the frenzied popular
demand. The new house is (of course) to
have everything the very best of its kind,
and to be open before Christmas. It will
be called the Grand.
“Stargazer”: There’s something in Oli-
pjhant’s play, “The Superior Race,” which the
Repertory people have staged in Melbourne;
but, to begin with, it isn’t a play, bein^ 1
really an original scheme for a lecture.
Oliphant’s main idea is gravely detrimental.
I have seen much of Austral-Asiaties for
40 years, and never met a half-caste who
worried as much over his lot in 15 years
as Mr. Oliphant does in 15 minutes. We
admit nowadays that a play may be talky
and do very well. Shaw is talky, but Shaw
has a capacity which Oliphant lacks, that of
making talk dramatic. Much of Shaw’s
talk is as dramatic as bodily action. There
is in it thrust and guard, assault and battery,
conquest and defeat. Oliphant can’t say a
thing and be done with it. Afraid the audi-
ence won’t get his point, he repeats it, and
the point is gone. Weld a bundle of needles
together, and the mass will not prick. This
tendency to damnable iteration is fatal to
Oliphant’s play, producing terribly swollen
parts, a kind of Oliphantiasis that must
prove fatal.
Clifton Boanas, who belongs to a family
long associated with high C and the struggles
which lead up to its perfect performance,
was among the composers represented at
the recent “all-Australian night” at the
Melbourne Masonic Hall. Boanas writes
drawing-room sweet-stuff, and could pro-
bably do something more if the Australian
publisher cared to egg him on.
“Barcoo”: Cedric Wills, one-time Wirth
Bros.’ “Wild West” horseman and lasso-
thrower and late owner of the Cloncurry
Hotel (N.Q.), has joined the Over landers. He
is on the job shifting 3000 head, and the un-
ruly bullock now roars at a stockman wdio
soon stops his gallop with that most insinu-
ating weapon, the lariat. In camp recently
he put his cowboy saddle and lasso to a new
use. There was no wood just where the
outfit unhitched, so Wills rode away to a
clump of trees, swung the noose over a
counie of dry limbs, snapped them off andi
hauled them up to the cook.

More people who think Private Enterprise
an excellent thing—when it is your own
Enterprise ! Bishop Wilson, the old cricketer
and practical Christian who used to be in
Melanesia but now has a church in suburban
Adelaide, wants the Anglican body to do its:
own insuring. He pointed out to a Synod
meeting that in S. Aus. they pay £6OO a
year, and in 10 years had collected only one
£2OO claim. For all Australia he reckoned
on a substantial fund to be built up by 1000
churches averaging £6 each. The meeting
approved the idea, and a *start is to be made
with a co-operative scheme designed to cut
out the middleman and put some more of
The Bulletin’s wicked ideas into practice.
But that isn’t always as easy as getting wet
in _ a river. Management is the important
point; and management can be so bad that
co operation may seem robbery alongside
even Private Enterprise.
Premier Holman’s friends are very trying.
Asked by the pertinacious little Dr. Arthur
whether he _ would curtail racing in N. S.
Males, Willie replied: “In regard to the war,
they were, so to speak, in an isolated posi-
tion, and at a distance of 15,000 miles there
was no need to agitate themselves into a
condition of fussiness about sport in war-
time.’’ It may have puzzled the worried
Premier to invent an impromptu reason why
he should not do anything to injure his
friend Ikey, the “heads” and the racecourse
owners; but to blab that the war was so far
away that it didn’t matter how Australians
spent their time and money was a horrible
break for a Government which put up the ;
poster; “The Hun is at your gates—bf-
destroys, ravishes and murders!”

“THEN HAPPY LOW LIE DOWN.”
Melbourne papers warn their readers of the grave
risk of contagion one runs in carrying dirty money.
WEARY: "Say, Dreary, you orter feel glad
when you think of the risks them blokes
run with all that dirty money.”
A sensible thing was done in the N. S.
Wales Divorce Court the other day. A
matter came before Justice Gordon, and on
a. pointed hint from the Bench it was agreed
that* it would be a waste of time and money
to delve into the ease. Whichever side lost
would be bound to go to the Full Court, so
it would be far saner to go to the Full Court
straight away. It is a tough proposition
that lies ahead. Mrs. Norton had got a
judicial separation from John, with alimony
pendente life, and she was in court with an
application to make the alimony permanent
when John died. Now the question is: Can
you get an order for alimony made out
against a dead man? It wouldn’t matter if
John had done the decent thing and left his
widow and young son provided for; but by
his will he passed everything to an infant
daughter and the woman whose name was so
often mentioned in the suit in Divorce. Had
Parliament done what it should have done
long ago there would have been no need to
risk this application for alimony; but under
the monstrous law of N. S. Wales a wealthy
scoundrel or weakling may, probably under
another woman’s influence, leave the widow
and family penniless. He is not allowed to
do it during his lifetime; why his estate
should be permitted to do it after his death
is a mystery. Or it would be a mystery if
we didn’t know that the law isn’t amended
simply because there is no class or party
call for an amendment.
From an Australian artist in London
who falls in with many British officers:
There is only one opinion as to the pluck and dash
o t the Australian: yet the professionals won’t have
it that he is a good soldier, as they understand good
soldiering. The trouble with Billjim, they say, is
his unconquerable tendency to “sport it,” and “sport-
ing it” is a deplorable error from the professional
soldier’s point of view. This disposition to make a
game of it swells Australian casualty lists in a woeful
manner; but apparently no amount of tvaining will
wean the Australian from his longing to tear in and
mix it with the enemy. .Jimbill's desire for in-fighting
means contempt of cover, and a case is cited of a
whole detachment of bounding Kangaroos being
tumbled over before reaching the Germans they were
aimed at.
A wounded Australian’s reply to all this: —-
It’s much of a muchness. If you go ahead like a
congress of grubs the chances are the German gets
you just the same, because he has 10 dozen shots to
every one he has if you go kangarooing at him. And
ask Fritz which is most welcome, the man who comes
dribbling on his brisket or the man who gets there in
a running jump with two handsful of Hell. We’ve
discovered, too, that Fritz when bustled is a rotten
shot.
Pozieres has provided a further answer to
the reflection on Billjim : and before it’s all
over the British professional may realise
that his way of being a good soldier isn’t
the only way in the world. At the root of
the trouble lies the old fallacy that we’re
English—or British —and being English (or
British) must naturally be judged by the
same standards. And of course we are
neither —-we are Australian. Not until the
British realise that will they expect us to
be different, and judge us accordingly.

From the trenches in France :
That night, after the bombardment had eased down,
I had gone round looking into the faces of the out-
stretched toms to see what men of mine had passed
to the Great Beyond; but ’twas not till daylight
that one realised in full that they had taken their
last sleep. Two of my lads looked so natural—just
as if they had fallen asleep. They had been hit in
the stomach. One in particular, only a youngster,
was a fine lad. He had his characteristic half-smile,
so life-like that I looked again to make sure that
he was actually right out. That was a sad ease- His
father was in one of the battalions about here, and
came to see him.

Justice Harvey, of N.S.W. Equity Court,
found himself confronted the other day by
one of those legal problems which Costs wel-
comes like a long-lost brother. After looking
at it earnestly, the Judge saw a loophole
and sprang through with great dexterity.
Put he reckons that the Bench sometimes
has a narrow escape. Up at Gilgandra one
of the local pubs has a slide in the bar-room,
and through this aperture beer may be served
to anyone standing in a passage. One day
a face was pushed through the orifice and
from it emerged a demand for beer. It
transpired that the countenance was the
property of a prohibited person, and on this
individual being brought up on a charge
of having “been found in the bar,” he was
fined £5. The point on which the case
turned was whether it could be said that
when only a face was in a bar the person
who put it in was there too and whether the
beak was correct in taking judicial notice
of a mere dial. Of course 'there were all
sorts of barb-wire entanglements behind this
face. Supposing the man had pushed his
body in and left his face in the passage,
could it be said that he was “found” in the
bar? And if neither face nor body material-
ised, but a long stick was poked through
with a receptacle on the end for booze,
would the person attached to the stick have
been in the bar? But Harvey didn't get
impaled on these points. He merely re-
marked that if the magistrate who heard
the case considered that a person who pro-
jected his countenance into a bar was re-
sponsible for his countenance —well, that
was a question of fact within the decision
of the magistrate. At which stage Costs
politely remarked, “If y’oner pleases,”
gathered up an armful of Split Hairs and
the peril had passed.

IF CONSTIPATED TAKE
CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Delicious “regulator” for stomach, liver
and bowels, for mamma, daddy,
and children.
If you are headachy, constipated, bilious,
or if the stomach is disordered and you want
to enjoy the nicest liver and bowel cleansing
you ever experienced, take a tablespoonful of
California Syrup of Figs—“Califig”—to-
night, and in -the morning all the constipa-
tion poison, bile and clogged-up waste will
gently move out of the system without grip-
ing, and you will feel splendid.
Every member of the family should use
this fruit laxative as occasion demands. It
is just as effective for grandpa as it is for
baby. It simply cannot injure. Even cross
sick, feverish children just love its pleasant
taste, and mothers can rest easy after giving
it because it never fails to effect a good
“inside cleansing.”
For 80 years California Syrup of Figs—
“Califig”—has been recommended by physi-
cians as the ideal stomach, liver and bowel
cleanser. Millions of families who are well
informed use nothing else.
Ask your chemist for a bottle of “Califig”
—California Syrup of Figs—which has full
directions for babies, children of all ages and
for grown-ups plainly printed on the bottle.
Get the genuine, made by the California
Fig Syrup Company. Refuse any other kind
with contempt. “Califig”—California Syrup
of Figs—is sold by all chemists in bottles

“Noosey”: I suggest that the gentle reac-
tionaries who clamor again for hanging and
flogging should form a
Society for the Social
Encouragement of Hang-
men. The profession in
the past suffered from
drawing-room blight and
was avoided by promising
men. Amongst the gifted
practitioners of my ac-
quaintance was Bamford,
who, in addition to a
fairly frequent cheque at
the “game,” made a bit on
the side by selling the
waxworks people second-
hand clothing “left” Ifim
by his patients. Bamford
liked his beer so well that
when an execution or
slogging was falling due
the officials found it
necessary to look him up
a few days ahead in order
to make sure of him.
Once he drank himself
helpless in a Russell-
street pub and the shud-
dering Sheriff had to take
his place. Gately was
another member of the
Hangmen’s Union whom
a little drawing-room pet-
ting might have helped.
Instead, he was actually
scorned, even by bar-
maids. Prospects of bet-
te r things perhaps
attracted Upjohn, who
finished a 12 months’ sen-
tence for theft in the
dignity of executioner.
But nobody asked him to

“Billy T.”: Everybody has a true story
of the eclipse. Here is mine. There was a
small crowd of the paying guests at a Mel-
bourne suburban coffee-palace assembled on
the front verandah, looking fixedly at the
partially-obscured sun when the stranger
arrived. He had his load with him. Possi-
bly he had got it by illegal methods; possibly
it had remained with him over night. In
any case he had it with him. He was
attracted by the gathering. He was not of
the same class; his clothes were broken and
his boots were unwholesome, but he mingled
affably with the throng, trying to discover
what it was on which general interest.was
centred. Then the idea came. He took his
hat in his hand. “A shillin’, please,” he said.
“A shillin’, ladies and gentlemen. A shillin’
for the eclipse.” A boarder turned on him.
“Get to the Devil out of this,” he said. “You
don’t own the eclipse!” The stranger was
hurt. He stood sternly erect. “P’raps I
don’t own the eclipse,” he said. “P’raps I
do. But, in any case, what right have you
lot to expect to see the show for nothin’?”

When the Orontes arrived at Adelaide on
the last trip from Britain it brought a
unique claim for the baby bonus. The in-
fant was born the day before the ship
reached the S.A. port. Acceding to custom
a birth at sea on a British ship must be
registered at Stepneybut, according to the
chief of the Commonwealth’s maternity
allowances department, the fact that the
Orontes had already called at an Australian
port entitled the child to claim Australian
birth, and bang goes another fiver.
Bather late in the day the clubs of N. S.
'Vales have found out what six o’clock clos-
ing means. The Commercial Travellers dis-
covered it when the other evening they
desired to entertain the Governor, the Pre-
mier and a few other friends, and found
that they must creep away into an un-
licensed cellar if they wanted to pour out
anything stronger than lemonade; and now
the intemperance cranks who ' ran the six
o’clock movement want to stop even the
lemonade. There are tens of thousands of
men in Sydney whose only home is a club.
A good many of them live at the club alto-
gether; more sleep somewhere else, but the
club is still their home. These men must
not now have a whisky in their home after
six o’clock. If they lived in an unlicensed
fiat or a tenement house-or any sort of pri-
vate residence they could go to the cupboard
and ask a friend to say when; but if the
club is a man’s home, or the place where
he meets and entertains his friends and is
entertained by them, he is a lawbreaker if
he brings out the decanter after six o’clock.
Of course the clubs, though they have been
very slow to move, are not taking it lying-
down. They are forming an association, on
the lines of one already in action in Victoria.
The objects of that body are, briefly, (1)
to communicate the opinions of registered
clubs to the Government; (2) to petition
I arliament on any matters affecting clubs;
(o)-to originate and promote improvements
in the law; and (4) to lighten the darkness
of the world after Stiggins and Chadband
have thrown dust in its eyes.
It only remained for somebody to accuse
the Huns of cannibalism :
A letter has appeared in a leading Egyptian news-
paper stating that the Germans were using the dead
bodies of soldiers killed in battle for the purpose of
making sausages and rissoles for those at the Front
(treating them secretly). The writer signs his name.
He is a commercial agent doing business through
Switzerland, and declares what he states to be true.
If the commercial gent, wrote from know-
ledge of the facts, some gruesome revelations
are bound to come along presently. The
effect of human German sausage on the
Kaiser’s troops will surely be felt. Gabbet-
tism may be mitigated, so to speak, bv the
mincing machines and seasoning, but, even
so, as an incentive to savagery a bit of dead
German must be very powerful. In the
case of the hated English the corpses are
converted into rissoles, one supposes. After
which the consumers naturally hold up then-
hands and cry “Comrade!” when they meet
any of Haig’s boys face to face,
* * * *
“Tussock Grass” calls for three cheers: —
Joffre and Haig and Brusiloff will be pleased.
We’re going to win the war. Everybody who is
anybody says so. Everybody who is anybody knocked
oft work in Sydney for sonie hours on August 4,
just for the purpose of saying so —to loud applause.
The Lord Mayor, Joffre will be delighted to learn, is
“more inflexibly than ever determined to fight to the
bitter end, and to crush the German monster until
the last drop of the virus of frightfulness is exuded
from its loathsome and scaly organism.” That
declaration ought to be worth two army corps for
the Allies. The Premier, Haig will be happy to
know, is concentrating his mind “on one ideal, that
of subjugating the enemy.” Joe Cook has made
the heartening discovery that “let the war last
three years or 30 years, it has to be finished.” And,
having drawn his sword, he will not sheathe it until
victory is ours. That is the true Anzac spirit.
Archbishop Wright is sternly resolved to fight on.
The Prothonotary is determined to “stand shoulder
to shoulder and heart to heart,” apparently with all
other Prothonotaries, and he will “never cease until
the power of Germany is absolutely subdued.” And
shoulder to shoulder with the Prothonotaries stands
the Chairman of the Stock Exchange, who is “grimly
determined to exert all his power until the full vic-
tory is achieved.” Then Mr. Hoyle definitely prom-
ises that “if the Empire calls, I will answer.”
Somehow X had an idea that the Empire had
not only called, but yelled; but, of course, that was
two years ago. If the Kaiser, like Kruger, can be
killed with the mouth, his name is Cemetery Mud.

“Mcllaggis”: With a wealth of musical,
descriptive Australian words to choose from,
some dullard has repudiated them all and
bestowed on Hughes’s fleet a series of alleged
names suggestive of the hybrid monstrosities
attached to racing ponies. By the crude pro-
cess of cutting the word Australia down and
dabbing another word on to the wound,
something has been achieved which appears
to have impressed the carpenter on the job
as a triumphant association of Australian

will be a procession of tubs rolling along the
raging main decorated with such inspira-

with “Australspud” and “Australcabbage” ?
And why not have pulled old “Australitz”
out and given “Australrabbits” a chance?
But who has done this thing? Is the War
Precautions Act inadequate to get him sup-

discharge was that he should leave Australia
at once.
A. L. McAuley, who has just been ap-

foremost authority on certain higher

imaginings have filled 16 books, mostly
on frivolous subjects like the “Spontaneous

Jack Stevens, ex-Parliamentarian, who
died in Maoriland a few days ago, was of the
first generation raised over there—-and a
hardy, vigorous Jack he was, too, before
Calamity came down on him with a thud.
He was born at Wellington when it was
mostly bush and wind, picked up Maori talk
as a boy, and for the greater part of his life
had. occasion to use it. As agent for the
Government he once bought 400.000 acres of
the Waimarino from Henare, and as every
separate brown brother and wahine with a
tribal interest in the various deals had to be
located and induced to sign the transfer, the
transaction took more than a week to com-
plete. A broad, strongly-built man with pic-
turesque whiskers. John Stevens was a fol-
lower of Seddon in King Richard’s spacious
days. But though he could speak excep-
tionally well he liked having a smoke and a
yarn in Bellamy’s better, and he preferred
horses to politics. Ten years ago blindness
settled on him. The old man was cheerful
enough through the long night, but was
probably glad enough to go. He was 71.
“Sapper”: Kitchener will always be asso-
ciated in my mind with a buzzing noise, a
big cloud of dust and a lingering smell of
benzine. I was in the Electrical Engineers
at Hobart when the Inscrutable came
through the Speck on his visit of inspection
in 1910, and it was announced that our
battery, at Lower Sandy Bay, would be
raked by the Great One’s eye. The O.C. at
once had hysterics, and a sort of spring
cleaning frenzy descended on the camp. We
scoured everything from teeth to search-
lights, whitewashed the row of stones along
the path, and finally formed up on the
parade-ground where we were fluently
cursed by the rattled O.C. as a wretched
collection. There was a buzz in the distance,
and as a scoht rushed up to report the
imminence of “K.” a yell of “ ’Shun !” .made
us stiffen. The band put its instruments to
its mouths and the drummer took a good
grip of his sticks. Round the corner whirled
the car and we got a 35-mile-an-liour im-
pression of a big black moustache under a
gilded cap-peak, a whiff of benzine and some
dust from our own path as “K.” sped on to
Fort Nelson. He never came back.
Frank Wilson, “Happy Jack’s” successor
in Westralia, is by profession an engineer.
A Sunderland man, he landed in Bananaland

Carr Boyd, explorer, prospector and yarn-
spinner. The Bulletin’s perennial old “Pot

ancient has lately taken up half a million
acres of fine grazing country at the back of
Laverton (W.A.), and he reckons upon get-
ting Uncle Sam interested. The farm is
pushing the ranch out of the Western States,
and “Pot Jostler’s” idea is that the rancher
can’t do better than bring along his capital,
experience and a few prize bull-harems to the
Laverton principality.
Mrs. Mellor, the songstress whose trade
name is Margherita Valdi, and who is spend-
ing a few mouths in Australia after pursuing
engagements in France and Italy for some
years, gave an unusual performance the other
Sabbath. Mrs. Mellor passes most of her
time at Geelong, and as a reshit of her inces-
sant war-activities is better knowii there
than Melba. After she had sung at a
Presbyterian church service, “a few words”
were suggested by the shepherd, so the
obliging dame climbed ifato the phlpit and
exhorted the brethren to do something for
the orphans of France —and when the plate
circled the customary 3d. was lost to view
in a flood of real money.
William Heggaton, a S. Aus. pioneer who
has just passed out at Adelaide, aged 90,

WELCOME TO W. M. HUGHES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Welcome! Australia on her strong bind legs
Hears up, elate, to shout and prance and sing'.
A little gentle rhetoric she begs.
Some crumbs of eloquence, oh, deign to fling'—
Large words of empire such as those that smote
The Duchesses and made the Tories gloat!
Murmur some tender word of things afar,
Of German commerce smitten to the death,
Of Britain aching with desire to bar
All Teuton goods and with triumphant breath
Kicking the bones of Cobden round and round
Till not one vestige of Freetrade is found.
Tell us about those greater years to be
When, federated to your heart’s desire,
All British lands that look to every sea
Are tied with bonds of brotherly barbed wire.
Spin the whole tale, use every outworn gag,
till up your lungs and flap your little flag.
Let off llic steam —and then get down to work
And tell us.of some closer, deafer things!
We know about our boys who smote the Turk
And of your own exploits with peers and kings,
But when your periods have ceased to thrill,
Tell us, Are you a tariff-sinker still?
We know already we must organise;
You told us that at least a year ago.
Though action lags, old time forever flies,
And there are other things we want to know.
For instance, without shuffle, shirk or fence,
Is your conscription talk a mere pretence:'
Answer these questions! We have plenty more;
But these must test the value of that flood
Of eloquence you spent on Britain’s shore.
Evade them and your name is simply Mud—-
Plain mud, the viler, stickier, because
Aou used this land to win you cheap applause.
Now please explain. Australia does not want
A flood of idle, high-falutin speech.
Leave out the noble Anzacs and the cant ‘
That made the thin, hysteric countess screech.
You stand upon your trial. Simply state
The facts for which impatiently we wait.
A ou left these shores a small, dyspeptic man
Whose best achievements were but poor and thin.
Now, making all allowance that we can,
A r our godhead seems .entirely tinkling tin.
This is our view. Get busy and remove it.
If you’re not wholly fake, stand out and prove it 1

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Treasurer Higgs, who got authority to
borrow 50 millions, asked for any amount up
to that, and received about 22$ millions.
The answer to the call was fair, though not
good enough to get enthusiastic about: and
Australia being a big place, and the local
loan not being a thing with which we are
very familiar, the right course has been
taken in extending the time for receiving
applications till September 1.
The Treasurer wants every pound that can
be raised; and he could not do better just
now than consider the question of selling
annuities —a method of raising money which
has the approval of the highest authorities.
There are probably thousands of women and
old people in Australia who cannot see their
way to invest in the War Loan because their
capital is limited and the interest is not
sufficient for their needs. In other words,
they are living partly on interest and partly
on capital. An annuity is just the thing
for such people, A safe and trustworthy
scale could be drawn up in a couple of days
by Ivnibbs, using the experience of the Aus-
tralian life insurance offices; and these
would, there is very little doubt, assist in
the matter.
The principle is very simple. You take
along £lOO and get in return not only
interest but annually a part of the principal,
the part varying in size according to the
age of the annuitant, and consequently his
(or her) expectation of life. Suppose, for
instance, there is a mother, aged 60, to
whom some son wants to give a little comfort
in her lifetime. If he put £lOO into even the
War Loan, with its comparatively high rate
of interest, she would get only £4 10s. a year.
But if he was able to buy an annuity, instead
of his mother receiving £4 10s. she would be
assured of about £8 15s. during her lifetime.
There are hundreds of men and women whose
families are grown up and fairly well pro-
vided for, and the little property the old
couple have should be used in making them
comfortable in their old age. The annuity
provides the means. They are afraid, of
course, to use up their capital themselves,
because they don’t know how loug they may
live, and they might exhaust their capital
and still be alive. The annuity guarantees
them a regular income for life in return for
a cash payment down. It is the surest
provision for old age that any man can make
for himself. It is the best provision that
a husband can make for a wife. And there
is nothing in the world like it for the
widow who has nobody dependent upon her
and for the maiden aunt.
Possibly under the present law Higgs
can’t offer annuities. But, as they would
make an appeal to some people who find
investment in an ordinary loan impossible,
and as they would make a new appeal even
to people who have applied for bonds or
stock, the Treasurer ought to take advice,
and if it be favorable no time should be
lost in getting the necessary authority to go
ahead,
The Public Trust Office of N. S.

„ 1915.. 7748 7017 731 923
„ 1916.. 9515 9122 393 1316
When this office started it took over the
intestate estates which had previously been
administered by a curator, who was
appointed manager of the new concern.
Beginning operations on Jan. 2, 1914, the
office naturally didn’t accumulate much
general business in the first term ; for even
though a man make the State Office his
trustee, he is rarely considerate enough to
at once die and give his executor a job. And
naturally also there were not many trans-
ferred trusts, such as there usually are when
a private dividend-hunting trustee co. is
formed. In the subsequent years there has,
however, been solid progress; and the balance
to the credit of estates has moved along
in this brisk fashion :—1914, £359,498 ; 1915,
£599,255; 1916, £843,301.
There is no doubt whatever about the cheap-
ness of the office. The original charges
were at least as liberal as those of private
offices; but, since the Act, which is manda-
tory in this matter, requires that the charges
shall be fixed at a rate sufficient to meet
the expenses and no more, two cuts have
already been made, and the rates are now
the lowest in Australia. . In addition, a large
amount of business is done for nothing at
all. The estates of 200 soldiers who have
died have been administered, and the office
claims that no charge has been made in any
case where the beneficiary was in any way
dependent on the deceased. Moreover, many
soldiers’ wills have been made and the office
holds them for safe custody. Having thus
already established a reputation for cheap-
ness, the office has now to set up one equally
for thoroughness; and in that connection the
Public Trustee’s remarks about the pay of
his officers are worth prompt attention: —
l would suggest that the Government should take
into consideration the question of remunerating the
staff in a manner more commensurate with the
nature of their duties....lt is a matter within ifiy
own knowledge that the salaries of the higher
officials are on a much lower scale than those paid
to officers of cos. carrying* on similar business in
Sydney.
That “the Government”.- should have to take
the matter into consideration is in itself bad.
Politicians should have no more to do with
the pay of these men or the conduct of the
Trust Office than the Commonwealth Par-
liament has to do with Denison Miller-'and
the Commonwealth Bank. And there will
be no general confidence in the Public Trust
Office until it is made quite clear that poli-
ticians have nothing whatever to do with it;
and they have a lot to do with it even if
they only decide what shall be paid to the
staff. .
The Public Trustee asks for several amend-
ments of the law. The Bulletin asks
for another. Presumably the law requires
the accounts to be presented in their present
form ; and it is a bad form. There is a
balance-sheet, a profit and loss account
(office administration) 4and a statement of
receipts and disbursements. But there is
no balance-sheet for the Public Trust Office.
Its own moneys and the trust moneys are
apparently mixed in the balance-sheet; and
that is most improper. If the Office’s own
funds .‘ire not shown there, then there is
nothing anywhere to show what is done with
them.

Apparently this bank begins to feel nearly
as well as it did before the war ; and that,
of course, wasn’t very well. Perhaps
Pearce, nominally Minister for Defence and
Chief Suppressor, could get some valuable
hints from the institution’s history. When
the boom burst 20-odd years ago this bank
pretended that there wasn’t a smash. It
didn’t therefore write off any capital to
provide for the heavy losses that had been
made. If it had said frankly to the public,
“This is the position and we have met it
in this way,” the public would thereafter
have had confidence. But even when, after
long years of patient plodding, the manage-
ment had probably cleared out all the old
rotten securities and made good the losses
they entailed, the public still wouldn’t
believe that things were right. It was
aware that a lot of bad news had been
suppressed in the past; when there was no
bad news to suppress it still believed that
there was, - and even to this day the City
Bank, though established over 50 years, is
regarded as an outsider and a sort of poor
relation and a lady with a Past. And when
a bank is that sort of bank it has a hard
fight. No business flows to it automati-
cally : and generally it gets the skim milk
while the banks which wear a prosperous
manner get the cream. Fortunately things
are not quite as bad in this case as they
might be, because the bank has amongst its
shareholders a few substantial people who
have stood by it. But. generally speaking,
if hasn’t a punch ; it seems to have no large
reserve of anything behind it; and when
trouble arrived lately its dividend instantly
fluttered down from (5 to 4 p.c. —4 p.c. after
over 50 years! -
And yet it looks from any point better
than a four-per-center. In the first place its
profit is over 6 p.c.; so that a substantial
sum is going to reserve. The share market,
however, says there are no reserves. The
shareholder who lias for any reason to part
with his interest finds that he cannot get
much if any more than half the face value
of the scrip. If the position is as sound
now as it is alleged to be this is very
disheartening. Here, in effect, is a bank
which on its own showing has assets worth
£8 19s. per share, and the most a share-
holder can get for them in the market is
£4 ss. There is something radically
wrong; and it is no wonder that every
little while shareholders prick up their ears
at the whisper that the City is to be
absorbed by some other concern.
And it isn’t any the less exasperating for
the impatient shareholder because, on
figures, the position is so much better than
it was. say, in 1903, when the same 4 p.c.
dividend was paid. Going back only 10
years there are these striking changes:—

But even if mere figures won’t console
shareholders for a 4 p.c. dividend and a
50 p.c. discount when they have to sell
their shares, they must surely be able to
get some comfort out of the fact that all
the time the advances are improving and
making the earning of larger profits an
easier matter.

Profits are nowadays shown net, “after
making provision for depreciation,, etc.”;
so yon have to take the management’s word
for it that just enough and no more has
been struck off profit to provide for the
half-year’s wear and tear. In any case,
that amount can only bo an estimate. There
was a time when unquestionably too much
was thus written off; and in due time a
large internal reserve was disclosed. But
things have changed since then. The 7 p.c.
dividend . calls for a lot of money, and to
provide .it the directors probably find they
must disclose just about all 'they legiti-
mately earn. The truth is that the directors
went ahead too fast in capitalising reserves,
and piled up the capital account too high.
tfiepast six years alone no less than
£146.000 if the present total of £466.007
has been distributed in bonuses; and there
were numerous capitalisations previously.
There may have been some justification,
from a director’s point of view, in taking
steps to reduce the apparent rate of divi-
dend (which is accomplished by the simple
process of watering the capital), but in
this case it seems to have been overdone.
Certainly it is possible that, though the
dividend requires practically all the dis-
closed profit, the disclosed profit is under
the real profit. That could be managed by
writing oil, as in the more affluent past, an
excessive amount against depreciation. But
the directors wouldn’t he found guilty of it
on circumstantial evidence. Look fit this
comparison:—

In the past 12 months ship property has
moved, up from £298,209 to £301,635.
Meantime no new vessels have been added
to the fleet: at the most a couple of the
boats have been overhauled. A few years
ago the amount spent on this work would
certainly not have been charged to capital
account it would have been treated as a
set-off against the wear and tear of the
rest of the fleet. Now the fleet, on account
of these repairs, etc., has been valued up
over £3400. From this it seems a fair
assumption that profits are not being
stuffed away, that all that can reasonably
be paid in dividends is being paid, and that
there can be no expectation of further
bonuses in the early future.
The co., which had previously operated only
between the city and the northern shore of
the Harbor, has lately got a leg in on the
south side, and now serves also Vaucluse.
This may lead to something; and the open-
ing presently of the new Zoo on the harbor-
side will be another source of profit: “a
satisfactory agreement has been entered
into with the trustees for the running of a
service of steamers.”

The directors don't quite know how to put
it. So they offer it two ways and you can
take your choice :
I.
In order to meet the increasing demands made*
by the Defence Department, much overtime and a
second shift was put into operation, and this has
meant a large increase in the output for the year.
It is hoped that the war. now raging will soon be
ended and that the co. will once more be enabled
to commence manufacturing for its regular cus-
tomers.
11.
Owing to the good year experienced it was con-
sidered that the shareholders, who had lost half
their capital, were entitled to something extra out
of the year's profits.
But the co. deserved it. And there is some
sort of poetic justice in the fact that it is
out of the Commonwealth that the co. is
making its harvest, inasmuch as it was the
neglect of the Commonwealth which pro-
duced the previous disaster. In the old days
of the Queensland State tariff the co. did
fairly well, though after 1892 not so well
as it should have done. But after W. M.
Hughes and the tariff-sinkers of the South
got control of the industries of the North,
there wasn’t a single dividend for 10 years.
In 1912 a payment was made equal to Ij-
p.c. on the actual capital and another of
li p.c. the next year. Then war dime and
made the factory as busy as it would, could
and should have been without war, and,
incidentally, made it possible to get in more
capital and put in additional plant. As
at June, 1914, the co. owed £15,929; two
years later it owed only £lO4B (trade
accounts), and had over £5OOO in the bank.
That it should have been necessary to have
a cruel war to thus put a wool-manufactur-
ing co. on its feet in a wool-producing coun-
try is just about as serious a reflection as
could be passed on any legislators. And what
of the future? Heaven only knows. The
legislators who made the old mess are still
in power, and it is doubtful whether they
are really sincere penitents.

Down to about four years ago the co. had
most of its capital in deposits. Then it
started to make advances on properties, and
now it has £56,901 in that class of security.
After these large advances had been made
and when the war poked its ugly head in.
a contingency fund appeared, presumably
to safeguard these threatened assets. What
ought to. be done with this contingency
account isn’t certain. In the foregoing
table the net amount transferred to that
account has been shown as written off. But
if all ascertained losses have been written
off the Contingency Fund, leaving the bal-
ance to provide for possible losses in the
future, then the history of the last three
terms would be presented this way:—

Perhaps the Federal income tax has
something to do with the transfer of the
whole of the undivided profit to contingency
account. The law requires the co. to pay
tax on undivided profit, and the directors’
contention no doubt is that, with property
values slumping and the security thus
threatened, the disclosed profit is at any

rate only tentative, if that. The point is
important, of course, because if the con-
tingency fund is a provision against losses
which have actually resulted from the
shrinkage in value during the past
couple of years, then the co. hasn’t
been earning its dividend, profits on
current business having been wholly
absorbed by the losses on securities.
In any case, the position is very different
from what it was a while back. The loan
just raised in London, with all the credit
of the Commonwealth behind it, cost 5| p.c.;
and it is madness for States to go on
borrowing at that price for public works.
Nor is it at all likely that there will be
cheap money for years to come. The
borrowing frenzy has been the chief factor
in the Sydney property boom. We have
probably seen the end of it for the time;
and that means a serious shrinkage in
It. and W.’s profits. The advances made
by this co. may be all right; but it looks
like a misfortune that the co. hasn’t got its
old bundle of liquid assets instead. They
could now have been made to earn 4 p.c. or
so; and, in addition, the old and well-known
co. will no doubt be able under all conditions
to earn a bit out of the business, given
reasonably good management.

A solid old concern this, with solid people at
the back of it; and because they mostly don’t
care what the market says or thinks about
the shares, they don’t make any attempt to
equalise the dividends. The co.’s recent his-
tory has been quite as good as it looks.

The hew Melbourne Board of the Banga-
dang, Adelong (N.S.W.), isn’t shy about
telling that it has had to “do a double” to
keep the finance going. A bit of sugar has
come in the form of bonus shares; but
something more solid than paper and pro-
mises will have to be evolved if the Wagga
people who are heavily interested are ever
to get their cash back. The new Melbourne
office thrills because crushings from 120 ft.
at: No. 1 and No. 3 shafts averaged 20 and
13 dwi. From this return the co. is doing
the sensible thing, and is putting up a
small 10-head battery, installing air compres-
sors and seeing if the mill will live up to
the samples as sent along by Harry Wesley
and his successors. W. .J. O’Dwyer is now
in possession, with W. H. Derrick as
assaycr, and the pair don’t hesitate to give
Bangadang a good name, notwithstanding all
the show has had to suffer.
Melbourne-owned Elsmore tin (N.S.W.),
which from the New Year to May 20 got
18 tons oxide from No. 1 plant, is hoping
t) do better now that the barge is dumped
down at a new site. No. 2 plant was got
going in mid-March, and, like No. 1, is on
lib. ground. Profits should show up on a
decent scale, even though costs are round
about the Bd. mark.
From a battler on many fields: —
N. S. Wales possesses a set of mining laws that
are antiquated, cumbersome, intricate and generally
inconvenient and unsuitable; yet the daily papers
have never made a respectable attempt to have them
modernised after the fashion of the Queensland laws.
Instead of railing at the unfitness of miners and
keeping a “mining editor” to run a column of
Stock Exchange wirepulls and rival managers’ re-
ports, couldn't they devote a little of their genius
and cash to finding out a bit about the mining in-
dustry and the difficulties it labors under? Apart
from companies there are individual prospectors and
working miners and cyaniders, but the dailies don’t
appear to know of their existence. Does the Herald,
for instance, know that whereas in Queensland and
Victoria provision is made for the acquiring under
a proper title of a heap of auriferous tailings not
worked by former holders, in N. S. Wales it is
almost impossible to do so? In fact, such a thing
as the Bananaland auriferous sands area or the Vic.
tailings license are not known to N. S. Wales law,
which apparently was made so long ago that there
weren’t any tailings. Again, in Queensland a pro-
spector or small miner can take up and hold under
a miner’s right a large enough area to make a
decent mine out of if the raw material is there,
while in N. S. Wales he can hold a claim only about
as large as half a pocket-handkerchief. Similarly
the Queenslander can hold as a homestead area bits
of goldfield ranging from a small area in a town up
to many acres (sufficient to keep himself and family
on) outside of townships, and so long as he conforms
to the sensible conditions imposed he is not harassed
by the ridiculous prohibition of transfer and so on
as in N. S. Wales. He can, in fact, once he has
conformed to the conditions of improvement, do what
he pleases or go where he will, and unless his ground
is required in the interests of legitimate mining his
title is as good as freehold. In any case, even if his
title becomes forfeitable from any cause whatever,
he must be paid full value for his improvements.
Apparently Sydney dailies know as little about the
mining- industry as most things else outside the city
boundaries. If they really wanted to assist it, close
attention to such matters, together with a little in-
vestigation into the reports of their country corres-
pondents anent the over-abundance of Mount Morgans
in their district, would go far to accomplishing-
something material. The frequency with which a
lode several hundred feet across, and assaying many
ounces, is discovered in N. S. Wales, and the dis-
tressing manner in which it afterwards lapses into
obscurity, is provocative of much mirth at the
expense of staid old newspapers which imagine
everyone takes them seriously.

Lake View and Oroya, in a London cir-
cular dated June 13, gives reasons for pass-
ing the usual July dividend. These are that
the Zinc Corporation and the Lake View
and Star, of whose shares Lake View and
Oroya is a large holder and from which the
co.’s income has been for some time past
largely drawn, had not paid any ordinary
dividends since the beginning of the war
and December last respectively. The Zinc
Corporation wants all the cash it can lay
hands on just at present for financial re-
quirements in connection with the Asso-
ciated Smelters.
Central and West Boulder (W.A.), about
which little is heard nowadays, announces
that tribute work was continuous on its two
Kalgoorlie leases last year, and that the
average return was under 7dwt. Scarcity
of miners prevents the area under explora-
tion from being extended, but the Board is
hopeful of overcoming the difficulty before
long. Most of the ground prospected during
the year was too poor to treat, but on one
lease a block of nearly 500 tons of lOdwt.
ore has lately been exposed, and the tributors
expect to stumble across others. The co.’s
Nigerian tin interests are at present unmar-
ketable and have been written down to a
nominal figure.
**- * *
Boulder No. 1 announces that efforts to
obtain another property have been unceasing
during past years, but that it has failed to
find one. Accounts show a credit balance
of £88,702, or £1336 less than last year.
Tributors are still working the co.’s 'Kal-
goorlie lease, but operations last year were
not so profitable as formerly.

The 725. 6d. and S2s. 6d. stone got in Edna
May Central west drive, No. 3 level, can be
classed as of the just-in-time variety. There
had been an unholy silence about values for
the best part of a week, and if the patch
hadn’t turned up the market would have felt
siek over the poorness of the July battery
run. This worked out at £3377 from 2905
tons, or £452 less than for June, and £1250
below the May return; and such things
should not be if assays and milling agreed.
V hat is pretty clear is that the south-west
section of the reef carries the best gold, and
it isn’t much to cackle over, seeing that 1841
tons crushed from there only averaged
295. 4d. per ton, leaving the balance of the
ore treated to go 12s. lOd. per ton. This
is about the average of the cement which is
now discarded as unpayable. llow crush-
ings have shaded off in the last four months
can be seen from the following :■ —-

With the battery talking this way it’s no
wonder the cold shoulder is given to the high
assay returns.

Prom Westonia:—
Edna May Central is looking very ill at present.
There is a decent bit of ore to block out on the
new lode above the 225 ft. level, but 12 months at
most will see the end of that. Then the death notice
may be expected any day. The 225 ft. level has opened
up very poorly ; and below that level costs will be so
heavy that it will probably pay to leave the ore
where it is.
Recent developments in Edna Deeps establish a
win for mine-manager Stuckey. Very few reckoned
he had a chance of sinking his shaft to present
depth ; and he might not have been so successful had
he struck the water troubles of Edna May. How-
ever, he has accomplished a great deal, and lias
proved himself competent, resourceful and persever-
ing-. Deeps was doing splendidly until a few days
ago, when bad air in the 476 ft.. crosscut for the
Edna main reef stopped its gallop. In order to
secure ventilation it was intended to drive along
the hanging-wall reef to the main reef at
460 ft. and along the main reef at 476 ft., con-
necting the drives by rise or winze. This would
have provided sufficient ventilation for some time.
However, the impatient Board has put market before
everything else, and ordered Stuckey to go right
ahead with the crosscut and get into the lode as
soon as possible, or suffocate in the attempt. It is
pretty certain that Deeps will have a greater length
of ore to work than was at one time anticipated, and
prospects are good. Any man who now backs the
Deeps as a wild-cat is likely to receive a bump that
he will remember for a long time.
Edna May's No. 4 level is opening up well, and the
grade of the ore being broken is gladdening the
hearts of shareholders. Prospects below the No. 4
level are also good. Within a few weeks the plant
will have been readjusted to effect considerable
economy in working costs, and next month the out-
put should be augmented to the full extent of the
treatment plant, which, up to the present, has been
working only at about half-capacity. One thing can
be said about the Edna May: it has maintained its
ounce-grade without those notable ups and downs so
dear to gamblers.
Consolidated is still taken seriously by some
people. It is not a mine, nor does it show any
promise of becoming one. Of course, a miracle
occur, and for those who like backing outsiders
Consolidateds offer the opportunity.
Battlers has some 2oz. to 3oz. ore available for
stoping; but there is not much of it, nor is thereamy
likelihood of reserves being materially increased,
there will be two or three crushings of about 1000
tons each. These will average, perhaps, 2oz. per
ton. Meantime, Battlers are quoted at 125., and
scrip is tight—which explains the price. The show
m many respects looks like another Empress, which
some dealers will not have forgotten.
Bullfinch (W.A.), with its excellent plant,
ift not ieeling well. It possesses consider-
able ore reserves, but the grade is not good
enough to keep the show alive very long.
Corinthiaii North (\\ r .A.) is in trouble,
nigh wages, high cost of mining requisites
scarce and unskilled labor, and an ore diffi-'
cuft to roast, make the proposition unprotit-
able at present. In these circumstances it
is highly probable it will shut down within a
month. It a good plant, systematic mining
and capable metallurgical treatment cannot
produce profit, nothing remains but to put
up the shutters. Incidentally, Corinthian
Aorth recently installed the two largest
roasters in Australia.
Bunant Mclntyre is going to., make an
attempt to float Allen’s Find, near Mount
Jackson (M .A.). The show promises better
than most flotations.
The old Lady Bountiful, at Broad Arrow
(\\ .A.), is being given another trial. Some-
where about 20 years ago the Perth and Kal-
goorhe papers were blowing about its pro-
spects almost every other day, and its shares
wea'e heavily trafficked in. Then the batterv
got to work and proved that there were no
dividends to be got. The show lav idle for
many years, and then changed hands every
now and then. Lately a party of working
miners who took a hand in' the ill-fated
Mclntyre gold hunt have been prodding it,
and they now claim to have got on to some-
thing good.
When a man gets Go3Boz. from 5052 tons,
earns a div. of Is. every six weeks, and
planks down £ll,OOO for plant in a lialf-
yeai, lie can afford to smile. That’s what
John 1 ill has done with George Dickenson’s
A 1 at Gaffney's (Vic.). By paying 225, in
J 8 months the co. has smashed the legend
that there were no profitable floors below
500 ft. in the big dyke basins of Woods Point,
lill, poking up from No. 11 level, proved
two floors, and he also has stone in the face
of his main drive. Adding this to the stone
at No. 10 level, Till won’t commit himself to
more than a year’s assured reserves. On the
basis of last half-year’s returns this .would
mean Ss. in divs. His Board, however, counts
on two or three years’ supplies for the neAv
mill. But even that won’t work out at 505.,
at which figure shares stand. Now that
dead work is almost done and cheap costs
are ahead, George Dickenson will have to
spare time from his Omar Khayyam to get
up an audit of ore reserves.
F. L. Stilwell. well known as a petrologist,
has been given the job of investigating "the
factors that govern the occurrence of gold in
the richer reefs at Bendigo.” E. C. Dyason.
who has been put into the chair of the Vic
Chamber of Mines, will, with Prof. Skeats.
keep an eye on the young man, who no doubt
will graft on lines laid down bv Walde-
mar Lindgren at Cripple Creek. just when
Stilwell’s appointment was made known, the
news leaked out that Dyason was the man
who had been collecting swags of forfeited
scrip in well-placed claims at Bendigo. There
is more than half a hint that Dyason has
also put pegs into a big area of idle land on
the Paddy’s Gully line. If the job Dy ason
has in mind is to centralise treatment, sys-
tematise mining, increase the worker’s effici-
ency and enlarge output, Bendigo should kill
the fatted calf for him. After all, it takes
a Bendigonian to work Bendigo, and “Teddy”
has a becoming pride in his birthplace.
As mining costs absorbed £8197. working
profits of Carlisle, Bendigo, for the half-year
melted down to £ll2O. But that didn’t'pre-
vent the Board paying a (id. div. f and State
and Federal taxes mopped up just half as
much as shareholders received. The lean-
ness of profits was due to the mill being fed
with 4f dwt. stuff. But the run of spurs at
1140 ft. is 20ft. wide, and 60ft. below they
belly out to 50ft,

The people in the north of the Speck
may not want a transmission line from the
Great Lake hydro-electric works, after all.
According to W. E. Shoobridge, M.L.A.,
they can have a scheme of their own which
will be no small potatoes. The twin Arthur
Lakes have an area of 9000 acres and an
alleged drainage area of 76,800 acres. Tney
are 3100 feet above sea-level, and close
handy there is a fall of 2300 feet in about
five miles. Shoobridge’s idea is to put up
a dam 30 feet high, which would increase
the area of the lakes to about 12,000 acres,
and then have a power-house at the bottom
ot the 2300 foot fall, only 35 miles from
Launceston. He reckons they could then
develop from 70,000 to 80,000 horse-power.
The M.L.A. is not an expert exactly, hut
his calculations have made the Northern
people sit up and take notice, and they
want someone to see about it.

Wolfram is. becoming so costly to produce
that the price fixed by the British Govern-
ment is now quite inadequate. Mount Car-
bine is one of the most important wolfram
mines, and a recent return reads 5 tons
16cwt. of wolfram concentrates from 424
tons of crudes. The value was £917 3s.
2d. = £l5B per ton of concentrate = £2 3s. 3d.
per ton of ore. And that won’t pay, in
view of the high cost of mining. Yet Car-
bine is rich compared with Block 14 Tor
rington (N.S.W.), where over 300 tons of
crudes are sometimes required to produce a
ton of wolfram concentrates. So far, this
co. hasn’t paid a single dividend.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, August 7, 1916.
My Dear Arini. —
In the Spring a maiden’s fancy lightly
turns to frills. Hence the recent mannequin
parades. The audience was always large
and varied. It included, besides the dressy
girl with tartlet millinery and long boots,
Mother of Six with a vociferous infant in
her arms. Women sat in stolid silence, with
an occasional ripple of comment, as the
majesty of Dress stalked the platform.
The taffetas silks were the solids of the
frilly feast. There’s only a minor difference,
as you know, between this sheeny stuff and
glace. So it is like days of long ago to see
the wide, bunchy skirts, with ruches and
stiff terraces of silken folds. But there’s one
shrill modern note to make a discord ; the
leggy effect of the 1916 silk gown would have
given the creeps to Charlotte Bronte, who,
you remember, invested in a new black silk,
fastened (high up, we may be sure) with
a brooch to meet Thackeray and other
London lions. But apart from the legginess,
things are back to the Jane Eyre period.
Evening gowns, in sumptuous tones of
yellow and amber, or foams of white lace,
are flounced, niched and tucked up here and
there. A gossamer leaf on a wisp or two of
lace or ninon makes the bodice. A black
evening gown a-glitter with jet was a most
absorbing garment. It had by way of a cloak
a filmy drape like a black butterfly’s wings
with a rose entangled in its beauty.
The Spring millinery, much wider than
the buns of yesterday, shows flat posies.
They are so flat that they give the idea of a
patient woman sitting on her new hat to
reduce it to the necessary squeezed floral
effect. Under the brim, just above the
wearer’s eyes, is another pancake bloom. It
seems rather a squinty form of decoration.
Mrs. Billy Hughes seems to have aston-
ished London society by being a “well-
mannered woman of intelligence and un-
ruffled serenity.” The fact that she dresses
well in quiet colors —as did her pretty sis-
ter, the late Mrs. John Haynes—was even
more amazing to the average Englishwoman.
The wife of a Labor Minister was expected
to wear kilts of gum leaves adorned with
strings of beads and pink calico. But she’s
too considerate for that: she leaves such
panto, costumes to the British House of
1 ,ords.
Melba’s matinee for the Russians in-
cluded a host of workers who will never see
themselves in print—the list is too long.
Her Majesty’s was comfortably filled when
two o’clock struck, and a thin d.c. overflow
hugged the back seats. In the snack from
“The Belle of New York” Flo l"oung got a
tremendous ovation. So the orchestra —-
which consisted of Truman at a small organ,
with Slap.’s baton waving like a sword over
his grey locks, and S’Leger in khaki at the
piano—took one bar rest. Later on Florence
removed her hat and had a front seat in the
d.c., having handed back the box which had
cost her £4O at the auction.
A matinee bite from “The Boomerang”
was followed by the crisis—grand opera
without an orchestra. “Otello” passed out
in peace; there being no Moor to strangle
the gentle Desdeinona, Melba just crept
under the quilt. Emilia (Ruby Gray, of
Melbourne) tip-toed through the scene as if
she were walking on the edge of a volcano,
and didn’t want to spoil her rose silk robe
by falling into it. Still the ghost of an
orchestra pulled through very cleverly, and
Slap didn’t, after all, slice off the top of
Truman’s musical forelock. Then came
desolation and “Faust.” The dreary prison
scene, with no angels and no fiddlers to
assist Marguerite’s top notes to realms
above, was full of straw and disappointment.
Goossens sang superbly as Faust and
kept a misfit wig in its place with much
presence of mind. But Melba was not up
to her top form, and Mepliisto Smythe’s
cheerful bellow didn’t improve matters.
Then the curtain rolled down and might
have decapitated Marguerite if she hadn’t
tactfully altered her route to the wings.
After a salvo of handclaps and a cartload
of flowers had greeted Melba’s reappearance,
our Sovereign Voice made the mistake of not
letting what wasn’t well alone. Her speech
about the little bird (a feathered Ananias
responsible for much trouble in this big
aviary) who whispered that the musicians
were very sorry and would be glad to play
for nothing next time met with diluted
applause. No class of the community has
suffered more than the poorer musicians
from the war. No profession has been so
often victimised at innumerable patriotic
shows. Orchestras don’t even get the use-
ful ad. of soloists who give their services.
They get nothing but a cold in their head
and the last train home after evening enter-
tainments. Their weekly wage would no
more than buy a “floral tribute” for our
Skylark. So gen. sec. A. O’Brien, of the
Musicians’ Union, has contradicted the
Little Bird. They are not sorry.for any-
thing except the lack of courtesy that didn’t
ask but took their services for granted.
The proceeds of the matinee include £l4OO
and a lot of trouble.
Last week I told you how bravely C. A.
LeM. Walker, the War Chest’s devoted
lion, sec., had taken the loss of eldest son
Alan, who, after surviving Gallipoli and re-
ceiving a commission, was killed in an aerial
accident in England. Just after I had
closed my letter, Mr. Walker received news
that second son Douglas, who was a driver
in the Field Artillery, had died of wounds
on July 18. Douglas was a North Sydney
C. of E. Grammar School boy and was in
Dalgety’s when the trumpeter blew the
“Fall in.”
This is Mrs.
Kate Dwyer, who
has just been ap-
pointed a member
of the Sydney Uni-
versity Council —
the first woman
to get there. She
isn’t a bluestock-
ing either: she gets
the seat, as a
nominee of the
Government, be-
cause she has
stood at the front
of the woman’s
political movement
in N. S. Wales.
To see her at her
best you must go
behind her on a
deputation to a Minister, or watch her bait
the lions of the Labor Conference. But
she has this personal interest in the Uni.: at
least two young Dwyers are students there
at this moment.
Wattle Day damped everything but the
spirits of the League. Heavily goloshed, it
put in a busy morning plunging through the
mud to give away the golden bloom in mean
streets and suburban khaki camps. Soon
after 1 p.m. director Maiden and a little band
of enthusiasts met at the Central Station.
“Liverpool under water” was the cheery
weather report from a railway-man. Pulling
its “mack” up about its ears the League
decided to go on. The drive from Liverpool
to the camp in an ancient bone-shaker was an
amphibious performance. Still, they got
there. From a hospital annexe they heard
the glad voice of a casual Australian. “Ah-
lia-ha! My dream’s come true!” The
Wattle ladies pounced on the invalid to hear
his dream. “I knew a nice girl would come
and see me to-day,” he said. “We’re only the
....nice mothers,” explained the procession,
leaving a legacy of yellow fluff by way of
apology. Mrs. Birrell Robertson took an-
other party to the Warren, and a eamn full
of budding gunners vawning at the ennui of
a wet day were prepared to be brothers to
the prettiest straight away.
The only daughter of the Ivatts, of Glan-
mire Hall, Bathurst, is going to wed Went-
worth Bucknell. I fancy he comes from
adjacent paddocks. Miss Ivatt is an ardent
young wool-spinster. The hum of her wheel
was heard all the winter, and visitors could
either purl or plain to keep things moving.
A station-hand scoured the home-grown fleece
and dyed it khaki with a local gumleaf solu-
tion. So the sock was pure Australian —and
ever so much better for it.
The Niagara was abloom with flowers and
crowded- with passengers when it sidled out
into the stream last week. Baronet Cooper
was beginning his second attempt to join the
missus and the boys; some of the softgoods
Sargoods were aboard; Mrs. Norman
Brookes, who goes to see her tennis-Red
Cross man on the other side; Dr. and Mrs.
Kelt.v; the Sep Levy pair ; Telford Simpson
(who hopes to be fitted for khaki) ; the
William Pat Manning dame and a couple of
daughters; the upstanding Miss d’Ebro (the
Melbourne girl who comes over to Kosciusko
so often) and goodness knows who besides —
among them a contingent rather than a
family of .T. W. Greens, with baggage for
nine.
Right in the middle of shearing Falkiner
and Sons, of Boonoke North, are being inun-
dated, as their manager, John Carse, puts it,
with applications from girls who want jobs
as boundary-riders—side-saddle or other-
wise. The whole thing originated in a joke
played on Otway Falkiner by brother pasto-
ralists when he was at the Sydney sheep sales,
and though the letters from the horse-girls
are amusing, the number of replies necessary
is imperilling the station office-staff’s im-
mortal soul. One damsel said that, though
she had never ridden a horse, she had seen it
done, and it didn’t look hard. A great sub-
ject for one of the little British mush
weeklies —the love story of the gallant Anzac
and the girl who “rode” the boundaries!
Sydney is these days a dull old place for
the Distinguished Person, who must inspect
socks or make them. So the Goold-Adams
Exes, have been getting _ what thrills thej
could out of visits to pyjamh depots and a
sugar refinery. In the evenings they sample
the local Quality which is asked to dine
with them.
The passage north of the G.-G. was broken
by a night’s rest at the Warrigal Club—his
favorite evrie in Macquarie-street. A ext
time his Ex. will be able to change his
boots at his new suite in the Commonwealth
Bank.
The death of Bert Norris, who went on
service as major of an infantry battalion,
robs the Sydney Bar of a charming person-
ality. After going into training in Egypt
with his men a year ago, liis legal ability
caught the eye of the military bosses. So
they kept him there as judge-advocate,
Thus he missed Gallipoli, and had been in
France only a few weeks when he met the
fatal bullet. Mrs. Bert, who used to be
Bessie Lane Mullins (daughter of John), is
in England with a very young baby Norris.
The second Verbrugghen-Goll recital
didn’t fill the Conservatorium —possibly be-
cause it was the Fourth of August and the
war anniversary. Rival gatherings, notably
an affair bristling with Governors and chief
citizens in the Town Hall, were expressing
their unshaken resolve to hurry others on
to victory. Still, the audience was large
enough to shake the musical rafters with
applause at the end of a perfect perform-
ance. Goll’s hair has turned a pepper-and-
salt hue since he first waved long black
locks at a Sydney crowd. They are short
and crisp to-day, and the owner of them
looks as if he found Australia a very happy
place to live in. Verbrugghen takes music
more sadly. Some hardy wights outside,
mistaking ill-timed applause for the end of
the Mozart sonata, creaked in to find their
seats. They were buried at the back, but
the Director used his bow like a bayonet,
and gave his mate Goll an anguished prod
to stop work. Peace being restored, the
music—which was warmed by two radia-
tors on the platform—continued.
Lieut. Tom Whitney, of the Royal
Warwieksliires, who was fatally smashed
up in a motor accident, was a Coonamble
boy. He was only 19 when he and his
motor-bike had the bad luck to meet a huge
petrol char-a-banc at a dangerous corner of
an Isle of Wight road.
At a dinner to Melba, eaten at the
Queen’s Club, one Carruthers, of Honolulu,
a protege of the guest, gave a “Cobra
Dance.” It consisted of involuted writli-
ings executed on the floor in a sitting pos-
ture, accompanied by wavings of the hands.
“Difficult to do, I should think,” one of
the guests dryly remarked, “but ruinous to
the clothes and in a lesser degree to the
carpet.”
Melba’s presence and campaigning in
Sydney have been a welcome distraction from
colds-in-the-head and war-talk. Four ex-
tremely well-tailored and -furred folk are
Melba, her daughter-in-law, her son and
Tommy Cochran. Last is a Melbournian —
a favorite dog-about-town there. He isn’t'
as young as he looks, so don’t go asking
why he isn’t in khaki. Besides, his clothes
are a joy to Sydney. Also the grace with
which he pilots the Constellation across the
mud opposite Paling’s.
This, Arini, is
Mrs. Bertha Law-
son, about the best-
known of the in-
spectors in the
State Children’s
Relief Department.
A bright, dark-eyed
little vital spark
she is, born in the
Gippsland Lake
District. Starting
life, she had two
and a half years’
nursing experience,
and taught a Maori
school. It was while
on a holiday visit to
Sydney that she met
and married poet
Henry. Some years
K > WAAAV. J Cell
later, her responsibilities increased by the
acquisition of two children, she became a
commercial traveller. Of this phase of her
career Mrs. Lawson is frankly proud. She
represented Todd, Lamb and Co., an Indian
firm. She “travelled” timbers and wall-
papers and silks, hardware and soft-wear,
and made a success of her job. She urges
that commercial travelling as a career for
women should commend itself to them. So fai*
as she knows she was in her day alone in the
calling. The Lawson son, a lad of 16 or so,
is at one of the agricultural colleges, and
daughter Bertha (Miss Rodwav did a por-
trait of her) is still at school. Both are hit-
the-ceiling youngsters, and great contrasts to
their little mother.
Mrs. Geoff. Oberlin Harris, of Lakenbam.
Mosman, who died lately, was a splendid-
looking young woman, and an untiring
worker for Tommy Anzac. She was a Miss
Bignold, daughter of a member of the
Indian Bench, who, when he retired from
his judgeship, settled in Tasmania. Deceased
lady married there Mr. Harris, now general
manager in Australia for John Walker
and Sons. She left two young sons.
St. James’s Hall, which has been smart-
ened up with a new peacock curtain and
other drapery, was heavily pot-planted with
palms on Saturday night. In the twilight,
the gas having been turned low, Violet
Ewart, a Melbourne pianist, backed up
Staell’s fiddle in a sonata (A Major, if
that’s any help to you) by Cesar Franck.
Then Reginald Gooud let it go, and sang
“She alone charmeth my sadness,” with the
usual encore to follow. After this, Violet,
whose bare arms looked very cold and blue,
gave a Chopin interlude. She’s a conscien-
tious performer, and looked properly sorry
when she hit a chilled finger-tip too hard
and missed the note. It was the end of
Chopin, and the player melted away behind
the palms.
Norman Lockhart, the Sydney man who
went to London on the Government I louse
appeal case, is now with the R.F.A. at the
Front.
Major Lindeman's death will fall heavily
on the gentle widowed mother who has had
a sheaf of troubles to whiten her hair. He
was a son of the late Commander Linde-
man, R.N. In the years gone by the Lin-
deman home used to be a hospitable centre
for naval men in port who preferred a grilled
chop with an old mate to the fancy fare in
the marble halls of wealthy strangers.
Young Lindeman, who was only 24. left a
snug billet with Dalgety’s to go to the Front.
Bruce McLachlan, lieutenant, put out of
action at Suvla after only a week-end spent
on the Peninsula, is now filling an adjutant's
job at the Addison-road camp. He is a son
of the late Secretary for Railways, Hugh
McLachlan, and before looking in on Galli-
poli had a hand in the Rabaul fuss.
While the poet sings of his girl’s bright
eyes, the cookery expert implores the girl
to note the flashing orbs (or otherwise) of
her daily fish. This, of course, if she has
married the poet and has to do his frying.
At the Glebe Domestic School the other
afternoon Miss Wilson, one of the Educa-
tion Department’s chief cooks, demonstrated
the art of turning out a savory dinner to
serve six healthy appetites for about Is. lOd.
The fish—a goggle-eyed skate—was on the
small side, otherwise there was a four-course
meal (with no second helping) for half a
dozen plates. In case you want to see these
Wednesday At Homes you’d better inquire
the way before you thread the labyrinth to
the small cottage used as a Domestic School.
Last year—or rather this year—some of
the Christmas billies didn’t find their
soldiers until May. Now we’re catching
Time by the big toe, and August 31 is the
crack o’ doom for the three quarts of com-
forts you’re going to send the Kangaroos.
Mrs. Herring—she used to be Florette
Murray-Prior—writes of daughter Diana.
She's aged four, and has already tried to
uplift a pearly treble voice to soldiers in
London. Her daddy recently got the French
Cross of the Legion of Honor, you remem-
ber.
Kevin Goldriek, who was in the cable
service at Fanning Island when the Dres-
den made its unfriendly call, goes away
shortly as a non-com. of our infantry.
Exams, passed at Duntroon should, how-
ever, set a star on his shoulder before the
war gets a great deal older.
Nellie Stewart seeks shelter in a flat and
leaves her beloved “Den-o-Gwynne” to other
people. The cosy cot has a restful Rose
Bay lookout, and I don’t think Sweet Nell
would fly from it if she were a millionaire.
The Charlie Kings, of Rose Bay and
Borni-Borni station, gave a theatre party
to Malcolm Henderson and his wife the
other night. She’s been away—London and
Paris —for years, and used to be the hand-
some Mrs. J. Richards, of this city.
Edward Goll was determined to see our big
blue hills again, so he week-ended amongst
their gum trees. That was while the gul-
lies were full of rain and the hillsides
streaming with cascades. But Goll didn’t
mind the view looking like a blurred mirror;
he was satisfied to take deep draughts of the
air.
Yours affectionately.
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, August 7, 1916.
My Dear Yaruie, —
A big crowd went out to Caulfield on Satur-
day to watch the first gallops of the Aus-
tralian Steeplechase meeting and groan when
favorite Wisconsin came down on his nose
in the Hurdles. There was a hot sun,
though the wind was nippy in the shade, so
the racing girls tried hard to dress for two
climates at once. Mrs. McMicking and the
daughters were heavily furred. Mrs. Leslie
Macdonald came out in her newest car —a
gorgeous dull orange chariot —garbed in
serge that was belted and puffed till she
walked like a pouter pigeon. She had a
pretty girl with her in a pink pastel plush
hat bent over a dainty nose. Mrs. Tom
Hogan wore a touch of the Hogan tartan in
her fur-trimmed hat. The tallest of the
Bowes Kelly girls, just back from Sydney,
showed a fine tress of pale gold hair and
the curve of one cheek under a wide-leafed
hat. The big hat is in the drapers’ windows
again, so our eye-penciling will be decently
shaded this summer. Dr. Stawell put in a
brief appearance; he is just back from one
of the Fronts. Sister-in-law Mrs. Dick Con-
nolly looked charming with pink rhododen-
drons in her shady hat. Mrs. Curtis partied
with her and wore black and purple. Mrs.
Leslie Stuart was among the absentees. She
had gone across to Sydney to look after her
sick husband. The Philip Russels were about
and looking very pleased over Phylactery’s
win in the Balaclava Stakes, in which race
the Gippsland Mills’s horse Caracre ran third
after being made favorite. The Manifolds,
who scored so well at Flemington the other
day, buzzed about the birdcage. The family
colors (gold and purple) were up, but did
not score a win this time. One ultra-
fashionable frock made people stare. It was
laced up the back and looked just the sort
of thing to madden a husband with.
Donald Mackinnon, ex-Attorney-General,
has two boys at the Front or thereabouts.
Young Donald, the eldest of the Mac family,
was wounded in France early in the year,
and has lately gone back to the firing-line.
Bruce, who only the other day was playing
cricket for Geelong Grammar, is now a
lieutenant in the Black Watch, getting ready
for his first scrap.
Colonel Fitzgerald, Kitchener’s secretary,
who was drowned in the Hampshire wreck,
was a cousin of Nesta Fitzgerald, the icy
Sassiety lass from Riddell’s Creek way, who
used to freeze nervous neighbors Avith a
monocle stare. The Colonel was an expert
golfer, but cousin could hold her own with
him on the near-by Woodend links.
A scribbling Australian, now in England,
mentions being at Grimsby for a few days.
"I met Lady ‘Tryphena’ Doughty at a war
concert yesterday. She is well to the fore in
these matters in this district and is leading
dame hereabouts.”
Maybe Higgs is all right, but I make my
best bow to the champion treasurer, and it
isn’t him. Her name is Purbrick, and she
—it’s a Mrs.—has just been re-elected to her
honorary job in the Melbourne Convalescent
Home for Women, which Avas enthusiasti-
cally acclaimed at the 30th annual meeting
the other day as the best of its kind any-
Avhere. It is said that the books of the
home are kept on an ideal system, and that
the lady finance-minister never lets the cash
run short. This perfect treasure of a
treasurer is now over 80 years old.
Geoffrey Kiddle has fallen in the big offen-
sive in France, after surviving wounds re-
ceived in earlier fighting. One of the
keenest sports in Australia, his first cavalry
dash was on a horse he bred at Walbundrie
station, which is now without a master.
Sister Rita is the only surviving member of
the family.
Leonie Peterson-Mackworth has been put-
ting in her second summer at Cairo. She
has been there since the gunpowdery begin-
ning of things, and won’t leave hubby,
though the trying climate is making her girly
slenderness even more pronounced.
George Meudell and his Avifc been
doing California. They Avere lately the
guests of honor at a big dinner party given
by Dr. Walter Lindley at the Sierra Madre
Club in Los Angeles. During one of the
talking inten r als George addressed the 200
Californians present on the subject of Aus-
tralia. And there are few men who can do
it more fervently.
Miss Skerrett, a smart Maorilander and
sister of a Wellington K.C., is staying here
under the chaperonage of Mrs. Tom Leding-
ham. Of course she’s keen on Red Cross
Avork and is diving into Mrs. Ledingham’s
weekly programme like an enthusiastic seal.
The Grimwades are a stricken family.
Norton Grimwade Avas just recovering from
the shock of the death of his sailor son when
he got news that his other boy had been
taken prisoner. Now his mother is dead.
The late Mrs. Grimwade avv.s a generous
woman, and handled charitable committees
with great tact.
The Maorilanders in Melbourne had a
gieat treat in the Auditorium last Wednes-
day when kinemacolor movies of Maoriland
scenery were shown. The G.-G. couple and
the Stanleys came along, and the usual
string followed by invitation. Maoriland
. representative Manson and his wife were
in the excellent company of Archbishop
Clarke, tvho wore his gaiters to keep the
witches off and told his wife the names of
the white-capped mountains. General
Williams and some naval men were close by.
and the Gaud Mayoral couple and ever so
many consuls tilled other free seats, of
which there were 2000.
Patriots who paid four shillings a head
for admittance to a recent fancy-dress two-
step for babes and flappers turned all colors
when the prize was pressed into the hand of
a girl with a German-sounding name, garbed
in the trappings of (Hold on!) a German
peasant! You could have knocked the
company down with a naturalisation paper.
Cecil M. Dyer, the keen-faced, blue-eyed
young man who manages Dalgety’s motor
business, has been thinking while petrol
has been jumping ,in price. The result of
his daydreams is an “atomiser” which
enables any motor to digest the despised
cheap juice known as “distillate” and do
extraordinary distances on it.
Hunter Barton, elder son of the one-time
Mint family, has been wounded. One
brother, a British captain, fell in Meso-
potamia, and Colonel Venour, who was Mrs.
Barton’s nephew, was killed by a sniper soon
after his arrival in France.
The Harry Hentys have hired out their
Toorak house and taken themselves and
daughter Maydie to Mount Martha for three
months. Maydie’s handsome young hus-
band, Ronald Gumming, who left his sheep
acres to take a hand in the war. sailed away
a few weeks since. The A.I.F. was good
enough for him.
Dick Rees, Victorian M.L.C., has a know-
ledge of French and pharmacy. Two of his
sons are already serving in France, so the old
man left at the beginning of the month for
Paris with the idea that he might find a
small war job in a hospital dispensary.
Hooray—even though his politics are mostly
of the blue-mouldy variety which go with
mottled whiskers and a seat in the Leg.
Council.
Adelaide confesses her wickedness again:
Last year Tattersall’s July races gave way to a
patriotic meeting; but this year we had the usual
old thing. There was much khaki in the moderate
crowd, and amongst the feminines was Mrs. Richard
Hawker, who is apparently going to win our “Queen”
competition.
Mr. Ponder’s motion to eliminate German names
from the S. Australian map was seconded hv ex-
Premier Verra'n and carried in the Assembly with a
unanimity that is rare. I don’t know what they’re
going to do about “Adelaide.” Addie, you know,
was a true-blue German.
The next item on the programme will be a Bill
for the disfranchisement of aliens of enemy origin,
which the indefatigable John has obtained leave to
introduce. That will liven up a few members, as
some electorates have so much Teutonic blood that in
the past candidates of German descent have been
selected for them as a matter of course, and elec-
tioneering pamphlets have always been printed in
German as well as English.
AVe are slowly cleaning up the mess made by the
ex-Rev. Paul Joseph. Montefiore was put under the
hammer again on Wednesday and passed in at £4OOO,
with a comment by the auctioneer that the land
alone was worth more. Tenders for the purchase of
the unfinished City . Temple on North Terrace have
been invited.
A cable message on Monday announced that Lieut.
E. AA r . Gill had been killed on the previous AA 7ednes-
day. He was the younger son of our old art-director
11. P. Gill, who died lately when on his way to
England with Mis. Gill. The elder brother is in
camp in N. S. AVales.
A Eugene Alderman Memorial Concert, to be given
at the Town Hall at the end of the month, should be
sure of a good attendance. The proceeds are to go to
the fund for the establishment of a scholarship in the
name of the late musician.
The first Catherine Helen Spence scholar, Dorothea
Proud, 8.A., has published the thesis she wrote to
qualify for the degree of Doctor of Social Science.
Its title is “AVelfare AAork.” In England she has
worked in the AA'clfare Department connected with
the Ministry of Munitions, and Lloyd George has con-
tributed a foreword to her book. Dorothea was
born in 1885, and has gone brilliantly ahead ever
since she passed her University prelim, at the age
of 12.
Dear, dear ! Tt’s come to this. Mormon agents in
Adelaide, “generally in stylish American clothes,”
are going from house to house pressing the claims of
the Latter Day Saints and their convenient doctrines!
Of course our Art Gallery, though smaller than
yours or Sydney’s, is “better selected.” But
we’ve just woke up to the fact that it has no battle-
picture of any sort. Its Fine Arts committee goes
so far as to say there are “no representative pictures
conveying* an impression of life and action,” but
that seems unnecessarily rough on Tom Roberts’s
“Breakaway” and some others. Anyhow, the ques-
tion of battles by sea or land' is to have special
attention.
Jack Stanley Low, late of Gallipoli,
has booked himself for the usual orange-
blossom ceremony with a Westralian girl,
Vittoria Yoss.
A note from a neighbor : —•
The other clay I read in an English weekly some
pars, descriptive of a meeting- in London a few years
ago between the woman on the staff and our gifted
enemy Enver Pasha. The Lady with the Pen
described quite innocentlc the handsome little man’s
hardly-concealed wonder at her independence and her
club, and he was dismayed that she should go off
unescorted (from afternoon tea) to keep an engage-
ment. She added that “like most Turks he is
getting fat.” Now, another lady, writing from
Melbourne this time to a Sunday paper, refers to
Enver as if he were a Turk, body arid bones and
brisket. The Turks have behaved so decently to
certain friends of mine caught on the horns of their
crescent that I sit down to protest against the little
apostate Enver being regarded as born and bred
Turk. Enver Pasha is a Pole, and he was a ltoman
Catholic. But he was educated in Germany and
there graduated in duplicity. His marriage to a
niece of the then Sultan, Abdul the Damned, helped
him to his present bad eminence. As to his being-
puzzled over the emancipation of the English jour-
nalist—not much! Polish women of the educated
classes are amongst the most unshackled in the
world.
From a Billjim in England : —-
In return for the services of the British staff
officahs in Egypt, who spent laborious days teaching
us mannabs, we are doing what we can for the
British staff officahs’ womenfolk. Fifteen conval-
escents were invited to a garden party at a swell
house outside Worcester. On arrival five Anzacs dis-
covered that the soldiers were restricted to a por-
tion of the grounds, the “guests” being railed off,
as it were, in a select enclosure. The Billjims stood
the gaze of lorgnettes for a few minutes; then they
whistled up a taxi and retreated to the hospital.
The 10 British Tommies remained. They, of course,
didn’t know any better.
The Clifton Springs convalescery for re-
turned soldiers has been closed. A beauti-
ful spot, but too many miles from anywhere
•-—off the railway track, with nothing for the
convalescents to look at but grass and sand
and sea, a few trees and hedges, and once in
a while an odd farm-hand with four-inch
whiskers.
Mrs. Percy Russell, Mayoress of Haw-
thorn, is organising a Red Cross concert
which will break out in the Hawthorn Town
Hall on Monday, August 14. The tickets
are only two shillings, so please take a
couple.
Following the French appeal the cry now
goes up for the war orphans of France. The
Alliance Francaise is arranging another
dramatic evening in the Masonic Hall on
the same lines as the performance given
during French week. But they have a new
French playlet in the oven.
The Victorian Kennel Club show started
barking on Thursday, with the intention of
keeping it up till Saturday and giving the
Exhibition echoes a good shake-up. There
is one real pleasure to-be derived from a
dog show, and that is the joy of getting once
more into the open, where there are silent
lamp-posts and voiceless flowers and trees.
Mrs. Waters (now at sea and on her way
to meet her colonel) left sporting sister Miss
’Whiting to show her miniature “Poms” and
gather up the championship ribbons for the
class. Sam Hordern cleaned the board with
his Scottish terriers. I would have shaken
paws with Clonmel Monk if he had stopped
barking for two seconds. Airs. Wallis’s
pointer dog took a ribbon, and a rather sub-
dued Louise Pinschof did sentinel duty
before a string of Gordon setters.
Along the side avenues of the broad St.
Kilda-road hundreds of toiling men are lay-
ing thousands of small tarred blocks. But
the good work stops abruptly just near the
Victoria Barracks, the reason being that the
point is the suburban council frontier of
South Melbourne. Gaud Mayor Hennessy
stands at the edge of his woodblock kingdom
sorrowfully pointing out that the half-job
shows up the necessity for his proposed uni-
fication of councils. He wants the suburban
councils to fall on the Melbourne body’s
bosom so that all can go to Eldorado in the
one financial motor-bus; but the little
nations are jealous of their importance and
their rabbit-skin robes, and Hennessy
couldn’t look more serious if he had taken
on the job of unifying Euroue. But D.Y.
may yet accomplish the apparently impossi-
ble. Until three years ago the fine planta-
tion of trees and scrubs stopped abruptly at
the same point on the map. Then the Super-
Mayor put on his impressive belltopper and
persuaded South Melbourne to join in. And
presently the inter-municipal traveller won’t
know there is a frontier there —or he won’t
if his attention is centred on the foliage and
not on the road.
There was an unrehearsed item at the
recent Town Hall concert of the Victorian
Vocalists’ Society—the concern which was
started to shoo the wolf, from the profes-
sionals’ door. The chief songstresses were
Dolores and Elsie Davies, and the latter
kept to the work of Italian composers.
Impresario Gonsalez was in the balcony,
with his wife and the Visoni damsel; and
the trio were so affected by the “homey”
rendering of Rossini that they rose up
hastily, gathered all the flowers from their
several persons—violets, mostly—and flung
them enthusiastically at the singer’s feet.
The staid Town Hall isn’t used to such
spectacular impulsiveness, but when it got
its breath it gave the Australian on the
platform another few rounds, just to show
that it thought so too.
The recent successful concert in aid of
musicians who have suffered through the
war hasn’t solved the cost-of-living problem
for the ones who used to work the At Homes
and little gilt-edged shows. There are too
many clever semi-professional amateurs
about. One girl violinist who owns her
own car is rushed with invitations these
days. So is another spoiled pet with a voice
and a rich Sister who is framed by a motor.
A local tenor who is notoriously fond of
the fleshpots is having his little hour,
lie can speak Italian somewhat, and as the
Best Fed want to have a few words with
their opera star guests, the tenor is being-
invited everywhere as interpreter.
The host of one of the first dinner parties
got a severe shock. There were a couple
of dozen of the Italians round the table and
he addressed himself genially to the hon.
interpreter. "Ask the gentlemen,” lie mur-
mured. “what wine they prefer.” “Cham-
pagne,” interpreted the local fervently, and
the host had to order up buckets of his ’O4
fizz. He said sadly afterwards, “One is so
much in the hands of an interpreter.”
When some of the petted stratfgers reached
Australia first they were —well, not in
luxurious circumstances. At their first
dinner party a home-grown turkey as large
as a small horse made the guests feel so good
that they joined hands and danced round the
sacrificial table chanting its praises.
Irma Caron is staying at Villa Maria,
the St. Vincent’s Hospital home on the
heights of Beaconsfield. She is the guest of
the St. Vincent sisters and is munching
Beaconsfield apples and resting after much
patriotic and charitable work.
Dolores is working for the Red Cross
these days. When I saw her she was piling-
up fluffy woollen baby-things to send to
France.
Pianist Elvins wears a broad smile as he
walks down the Block. The Seotney
Howard concerteers are taking him as
accompanist to Sydney, Brisbane and
Adelaide.
Tenor Fred Blarney, the rotund and baby-
like Pinkerton who wooed “Butterfly” Amy
Castles, was lately in danger of being-
gathered in by recruiting-officers in Britain ;
but musical piliman Beecham put in a plea
that he Couldn’t do without the fair, fat
youth until the end of his big London opera
season. The authorities grunted their con-
sent and permitted Blarney and two equally
portly tenors (their weight averaged 18
stone) to avoid trench life for a few more
months. Beecham pulled the fat out of the
enemy’s fire that time.
D’you remember baritone 11. Rateliffe. who
left here about three years ago'? He was
doing nicely, thank you, among English pro-
vincial towns, etc., when Europe caught fire.
Now lie’s in khaki as a lieutenant. Rateliffe.
a Ballarat boy to begin with, has employed
his spare time singing into canned-music
machines —a profitable business. Lately the
magazines which push this trade have been
alluding to him as “a splendid young bari-
tone,” and so on.
Dolores recently amazed some of the
sports in Melbourne by showing that she
was a crack shot. “I’d fight if I were a
man,” says the dimpled singer; “but as it
is, I may only pot eggs at so many yards.”
Annie Jones, “The Story Girl,” is billed
for the Playhouse on August 20. . Her
thoroughly Australian job is to tell original
Outback yarns to the accompaniment of a
grand piano. The grand piano will give the
show the true Bush touch.
The May Vale paintings went off with a
good flutter of cheques during the just-
finished show. The Whipples, who inherited
the Eliza Hall Avoca place, bought a won-
derful garden full of lilac.
Allium has come into its own again. Some
years ago it was solemnly turned out of the
British Pharmacopoeia by medical men sit-
ting in conclave. Turned out with smiling
contempt. An old woman near the French
battle-front into whose care were sent
soldiers suffering from suppurating wounds
got such a reputation for her cures that
French and British doctors went to investi-
gate. They found that she used poultices of
crushed allium. Allium is garlic.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANANA.

DEWARS
In the case of Whisky the
General Verdict is in favour
of Dewar’s on three counts,
MELLOWNESS—PURITY
RELIABILITY
Mellowness. That alluring perfection
of flavour that begets the happy smile of
appreciation. Dewar’s never robs one of
pleasure—be the anticipation never so great.
Its charm of flavour is elusive and exclusive
—soft, rich and yet crisp.
Purity. The safeguard of health and the
rock on which the reputation of Dewar’s
stands. It is this domination of Purity in
all the stages of preparation that makes
Dewar's the Aristocrat of Whiskies whose
companionship is ever a source of unceasing
delight and happiness.
Reliability is the crowning virtue of
Dewar’s. All its merits in Distillation,
Blending, Purity, Age and Flavour contribute
to this one great end: —that no matter when
or where you buy Dewar’s you can, without
any fear of disillusionment, rely on an unvary-
ing measure of rarest pleasure that makes
Dewar’s a perfect treasure.

“H.V.E.” t Touching serpents, I think it
is not generally known that these amiable creatures
eat one another. I have taken the tail end of a
brown snake out of the body of a black one. The
deceased had been swallowed head first, and all but
the tail end had been digested. In another case
what appeared to be an abnormally long black snake
proved to be two distinct snakes, one of which had
already swallowed the head and neck of his brother
by his father’s second wife. The process is slow, and
considerable salivation is necessary. Snakes also eat
eels, and prefer them alive—they are not, as a rule,
carrion-eaters. Last summer I observed an enormous
black snake following closely in the wake of a
smaller one—his ladylove, no doubt. No weapon of
offence except a few light chips of wood were avail-
able, so from a distance of about five feet behind the
couple I flung one of these, which hit the big snake
fair on the neck. Like a flash about two feet of
devil rose in the air with flattened head and neck,
while the beady eyes glared around with as savage a
“Who-did-that?” expression as ever I saw. Directly
he discovered his enemy the big fellow came on in a
series of looping bounds, but not a stick or stone was
available, so there was nothing for it but to execute
strategic retreat. The snake soon g'ave up the chase

and crawled sulkily into a hollow beer-barrel (all
beer-barrels are hollow when they’re empty). On
another occasion I induced a black snake to eject
some poison on to the blade of a tomahawk. The
venom is like clear, thin honey in appearance, and
quite colorless—not green as is sometimes asserted.

“Eld”: What a lot of nosepaint friend
“Merrigal” must have folded himself around when
he saw the army corps of soldier crabs near Manu
Manu (Papua) forming squares and rhomboids (B.
l/6/’l6) ! What he really saw was thousands of
blue and red-clawed soldier-crabs standing at the
doors of their mud dug-outs and underground dwell-
ings, chatting over the virtues Sf rock oysters on
the shell and the reason why Port Moresby’s new
wharf is so long unbuilt. Nearly all the coast
between Giabada and Manu Manu is inhabited by
these jolly little crabs.

“Nick Bottom”: Pure affection for my
fellow-man urges me to tell “Sid” (B. 13/7/’l6),
who praises milking machines, that he is adopting
the surest method of ruining his supply depbts. I
have seen tubes used and I know the result of the
unnatural proceeding. By the time the cows had
had. six months of the treatment the majority of
them were spoiled. Several had lost one or move
“quarters” of the udder, while the others had
developed calloused teats and were of little use to
anyone. Evidently “Sid” wrote his par. before
cooling down after his first transports. Let him
open his face again in a few months.
* *• * *
This is to corroborate “Play” (B.
13/7/’l6). There are certainly men who possess
what has been styled, as regards animals, the hom-
ing instinct, or the magnetic sense. I quite satisfied
myself about two cases, in one of which the man
said that he felt the right direction “in his bones.”
The other said that he didn’t have to think about
the way to go; he “just went” ! The psycho-physio-
logical question (half-time here for drinks)
involved is still very obscure. Apart from
the direction-sense indispensable to the migra-
tion of birds over wide stretches of ocean, it is
unquestionable that many non-migratory animals—
horses, cattle, dogs, and notably cats—possess the
power of returning- by the shortest route to a point
from which they may have been brought witli many
changes of line. The best provisional explanation is
that the faculty consists in automatic brain-registra-
tion (sell a horse here) by which every direction-
change on the outgoing journey leaves behind it a
record in the cerebral nerve-system, so that, as a
result, the general direction -of the starting-place is
retained in the memory. (Another bob in.)

“Barcoo”: Someone asked for a cure for
mange in horses. The following is certified as being
dinkum by P. Williamson, manager of Brockersley
Stud (Q.): Fig leaves, beaten to pulp in a mortar,
soaked in buttermilk for a night and brushed or
rubbed in three times a day every four days for
one month. Such alleged cures as tar and sulphur,
paraffin and water, and boiled liquor off corn-beef
have been proved more or less failures. For the
sake of curiosity buy a couple of mangy prads and
try Williamson’s specific.
“X.Y.”: The palpoo, or kangaroo rat, is
the Hun of the marsupial species. He alone builds
himself a comfortable house, sometimes transporting
the building materials a long- way, and takes every-
thing he can eat, even to flesh. Also, he is of no
use at all. His pelt is worthless and he smells badh'.
One palpoo will dig up more planted maize than a
dozen bandicoots, and he will gladly travel miles to
do it. His curiosity makes him an easy victim to the
shotgun; . When a strong light, as from a cycle-

lamp, Is thrown on him he will sit up to examine
it, showing his white chest as a target. I have by
this plan shot a dozen within an hour. The best
way to deal with both palpoos and bandicoots is to
lay phosphorus baits of pollard in a freshly-turned
furrow. Make the baits about the size of a Barcelona
nut and drop them at intervals of two feet and
leave uncovered. This should be done a week before
planting maize. I have found such measures entirely
successful against both these marsupials.

morel, a curtous "fungus which confines itself to beech
forests, and is much in evidence about Lake St. Clair.
It is the sole representative of its family in this
hemisphere, and like other fungi of which the toad-
stool stage is merely the florescence, the morel does
a good deal of secret-service work before it comes to,
light. -The spores attack a stem of the beech and
gradually produce an excrescence around which the
morels appear. The finished stage i.s handsome, the
creamy globes hanging like a circle of fruit around
the knotted branch. When ripe they fall and .make
way for next year’s crop. In their dried state- they
look much like quandong stones, I believe their
growth is confined to Tasmania.

“Aneb”: “Quidam” (B. 29/6/’l6), talk-
ing of bracken fern, says “it takes five cuttings at
ss. per acre before the roots-die.”- A n Gippsland I
know one big area that was cut 15 times in 12
months. The first cutting cost nearer Bs. than 55.,
and the subsequent cuttings about 4s. 6d. per acre.
The same ground has been cut six times since at a
cost of about 2s. per acre, and the roots are not dead
vet. If “Quidam” can kill the roots for 15s. an
acre I beg him to come to Gippsland. A fortune
awaits him and the residents'. Ploughing three times
Will kill the fern, but to clear land for
the plough costs anything up to £6O per
acre. Cutting twice a year, as so . often
recommended by our farmers’ papers, while
thinning will not eradicate the pest, as proved
locally on every side. “Quidam” is correct in say-
ing that burning increases the roots, and this,
strangely, applies to swordgrass and blackberries—
two other of our simple pleasures.

“Tropicus”.: All this talk about thorp
being one albino in each Papuan village is rot, for
of towns, hamlets, villages, collections of human ken-
nels, abodes of rest, sanctuaries of sloth, and domi-
ciles of human demons the discolored territory has
thousands, and there are not thousands of albinos,
nor even hundreds. Albinos in this country are rare
enough to excite considerable notice when the hard-
working magistrate or energetic prospector sights
one obstructing the landscape. There are several
tribes where the white-brown person is not uncom-
mon—Kerepunu, a village noted for the ardent friend-
liness of its ladies, to name one. In this delectabie
spot there is a family of which two members are
albino—a man and a girl. The man looks exactly
like the George Marlow version of a Dublin rioter;
•but the girl is a pleasant little lady with nice
curly hair and pink eyes. The first time the writer
saw the pair he thought they were the product of
the early and wicked days when beche-de-mer fishers
from Australia made Kerepunu a pocket edition of
Malay-street, Singapore. A strange feature about the
freaks is that they become quite burnt when exposed
for any time to the sun’s rays. The ordinary brown
brother has a hide That would make a rhinoceros
envious, so that the sunburning of the albinq is a
phenomenon worth recording. There are manw other
red-skinned natives about Papua whom the average
traveller thinks are albinos, but careful observation
generally discloses them to be only the owners' of a
particularly horrid form of skin disease, one that has
so far proved to be incurable. Talking of Kerepunu

MRS. SNAPP: “ Nonsense, Snapp, nonsense!”
brings to mind that this unsavory spot is the dwell-
ing-place of a family of hermaphrodites, the pffspring
of ordinary savages. The cheerful parents allege that
their unpleasant progeny are the result of charms
worked by some unknown mountaineer sorcerer, blit
why the jungle magician singled their family out for
this vengeance is not. within their knowledge. Being
coastal Papuans and firm believers in sorcery, they
naturally pass on the blame of anything they cannot
understand to their cousins in the interior, and let it
go at that.

COHEN (excitedly): “Hey! Are you the feller what retheued my liddle boy from
drownin’?”
THE H ERO: “Yes.”
C OHEN: “Veil, VERE'S HIS HAT?”
“Montalex”: I’ve measured scores of
eagles, and my top-figure was 91 inches, for one of
three I shot near Dandenong (Vie.), the others going
83 and 79. “A.A.8.” (B. G/7/’IG) may give this
to Dr. Leach as absolutely correct for natural spread
—no straining on the wing-tips from each side. The
bird could in that way have been made an eight-
footer, and 1 suspect that that’s how the big figures
are worked. I once saw an albatross, 13 feet in
spread, made to measure 15 by cutting the flexor-
tendons in the wing-angles and then dragging hard
on both -sides. That faked record would probably
find its way into ornithological works as authentic.
“Bart” : I move that a D.S.O. be awarded
to King Billy pine, which grows on the wet side of
Tassy, as the best timber for huts. The wood is
soft and light, with a grain as straight as a dead
missionary, And so free that you Can split palings
from dt with any blunt old ironmongery. The
palings 'run out almost as clean and smooth as if
they had been planed, and have a delightful aroma,
ike., they smell bosker. Also, the wood .doesn’t get
ditty with age. A King Billy hut even after years
of disuse will remain spick and span, grows no whis-
kers such as a structure of gum palings will, and
the only obnoxious insect it acquires is a resi-
dential snake or two sometimes, especially if you’re
-married.
“Spud”: Do you think this can be
beaten? On Dingo Creek lewt. of Late Rose potato seed
was sown in a quarter-acre plot. The stalks grew
from four to five feet long, and had to be harrowed
from the ground before the potatoes could be dug.
On each stalk there were 42 potatoes, in three sizes,
14 large, 14 medium and 14 small, and the potatoes
from three stalks would more- than fill a kerosene-
tin. After five people had been supplied for three
weeks or more, 49 bags of tubers were carted away
in four-bushel bags.
* * * *
“Hay”: Have seen some boshter cod
landed not far below Menindie (N.S.W.) without
line or bait. Black brother was the fisherman, but
his method could only be adopted when
the river was low and became a string of
waterholes connected by a slender thread
of running water. These holes were fed
by springs from the banks and were clear
as crystal to a great depth. Armed with
a thin iron spear (before lie met the
white man he used hardwood) about 3ft.
long the black entered the
water in a sitting position,
sinking slowly down with-
out seeming to alter his
attitude. In the clear
water he could be plainly
seen moving about among
the logs, where he said the
fish were asleep. If un-
successful in his search he
would rise until liis mouth
was above -the water, draw
in a few breaths and then
sink again. When he found
a fish there was a sudden
thickening of the water,
and nothing could be seen
till Binghi- rose to the sur-
face with liis catch, liis
sharp spear being driven
right through the bod and
grasped oh either side. The
most Surprising part of
the performance was the
length of' time the abo,
could remain below. When
the riyer was up Binghi
did most of his fishing in
the baek waters with a
net.
“Pick”: What marine savage is it that
preys upon the-penguin? Bare on the N. S. Wales
coast, those 'bird-fish swarm in myriads upon Mon-
tague and Gabo Islands, and the crannies of the
rocks are regular hospitals, in* which torn and
tattered wrecks recover from wounds received at
sea. On the slopes of the islands, among the
boulders,'- and wherever a hollow can be found in
the cliffs, the finned birds do their nesting. They
are utterly devoid of fear, and walking among them
one has to step cautiously to avoid squashing the
fruit or trampling upon the hatchers. If at any
time an egg gets a roll on, there follows a race
between it and its owner towards the sea front, and
the language the owner uses in heading off and
twisting her property baek to its nook is unladylike
in the extreme. The real sports tournament, though,
comes when the young ones are out for their early
lessons in swimming. Regiments of the little
waddlers advance towards the waves and are drawn
seaward in the backwash. The next wave tumbles
them ashore up-side down. You would hear the
merry juvenile laugh were it not for the boom
of the Pacific. But occasionally the Ilun of the
deep is on the job and there is much killing and
mutilation among the babies before their mothers
coax them ashore.
* * * *
“The Hum”: Why do horses gnaw the bark
off trees, particularly white box, just at this time
of the year? Every tree in my paddoclc has been
barked from the ground as high as the prads can
reach. There is good feed in the paddock and rock
salt is always around.
* * * *
“J.C.”: In the Waikato bush an old
pakeha shingle-splitter by the name of Billy Naylor
used to make my youthful stomach squirm with his
/iw/Mi-devouring feats. The huhu is a big fat ugly
white wood-grub found in decayed trees, and when
Billy struck a punky patch in a matxii or a kahikatea
pine log he’d go for those unhealthy-looking huhu
with the gusto of a Select Methodist at a tea-fight.
One after another, intact except for the head, which
even Billy could not tackle, they would disappear
into his hairy face. He often pressed me to join him
at his afternoon huhu, , declaring that the tucker
was far superior to anything in the meat line, but I
side-stepped, though I guess I’ve swallowed many
worse meals since. Billy compared the grubs to
oysters minus the saltiness. He was an old Crimean
and Indian Mutiny soldier, and learned the huhu
trick from his Maori missus.

“SilaS Snell”: Many people have tried to
explain why cattle feeding on the Black Cap Plains
always face north and south, but only one is entirely
satisfactory. It has been demonstrated that the
magnetic current is extremely powerful on these
plains. It has been assumed that the current, operat-
ing upon the nervous system of the cow, or of the
cow’s male relation, draws the animal unconsciously
north and south as it draws the needle. This explana-
tion is the more specious for the fact that cattle in
the vicinity are notoriously susceptible to electrical
influences. The fact that more cow T s are struck by
lightning on Black Gap Plains than on any other
portion of the earth’s surface of the'same extent can
be proved by statistics. Another explanation of the
phenomenon is based on the circumstance that the
keenest winds strike the plain through the Great
Gate, the gap in West’s Range, and the cattle, having-
long sought to present the smallest possible portion
of their surface to the blast, the north and south
position has at length become instinctive. The situa-
tion of Eel Creek to the north and Little River to
the south is offered as yet another explanation. The
cows (and cow’s uncle) are always feeding towards
water, it is said. But having investigated thoroughly,
I say without hesitation that there is only one eluci-
dation of the mystery involved in the circumstance of
cow (and cow’s connections) inevitably pointing due
north or south when browsing —they don’t 1

William of Prussia hit this co. back and
front. First, the war has put an end for
the time being to oversea gadding: and the
oversea gadder leaves many- a hundred
pounds in the Australia office. And in the
second place, while thus cutting into the
income, the war put up the price of pro-
visions and hit up exes, generally. Add to
these temporary troubles the further rise in
wages (which won’t be altogether tem-
porary), the new competition which has
arrived during the year, the earlier closing
of the bars, and a fire which put a good
part of the hotel out of use in the busy
Christmas time, and the slump in profits is
fully explained. But, notwithstanding the
successive knocks, the directors don’t believe
that all joy has left the world for ever. As
a good deal of work had to be done on top
on account of the fire, plans, etc., were pre-
pared for a couple more storeys, and
authority was obtained to add them. For
the immediate present, however, the direc-
tors will be content to extend the winter
garden.
Fortunately the co. during its very
affluent times put itself into a strong finan-
cial position. Its total liabilities now are
only £14,928, part of which is in respect
of premises not yet used for hotel purposes,
but secured with a view to extensions.
Apart from the freehold (£j.75,000) _ and
furniture and machinery, the co. has £25,016
of assets. Capital is now £33,000 in 6 p.c.
cumulative pref. shares and £150,000 in
ordinaries. The dividend on ordinaries for the
. year is Is. 4d. - £6 13s. 4d. p.c. On the pay-
ments being made for the second half-year the
reserves will amount to £48,098 less good-
will £20,000. The divs. require £11,980; so
£l6O net was earned in excess of the amount
distributed.

1 luring the year capital was increased from
£90,000 to £lOO.OOO, and the div. for the
second half-year, now payable, is on the
full amount. The profits depend of course
upon the stocktaking; and that ean’t be
checked. But in this case the shareholders
get more than the usual attestation: here
the stocks are “taken under the supervision
of Messrs. R. Simmons and J. Goodheim,
directors, who certify to the correctness of
quantities and values.” The profit thus
arrived at, and after allowing what looks
ample for depreciation of rolling stock, etc.,
has given an average of 14 p.c. on the
capital paid up; and for the past two years
the return has been a shade over 15 p.c.
But The Bulletin doesn’t propose to
suggest that the past two years have been
normal, especially in this business. There
probably never was a time when Australia
had so much money to spend at Mick
Simmons's; but a great deal of it has been
borrowed, and what we smoke to-day we
must pay for to-morrow. In those circum-
stances the wide margin at present between
disclosed profits and dividends must be very
comforting to shareholders. It means that
there can be considerable contraction with-
out interfering with the 10 p.c. As for the
principal it is probably as well secured as
most money in commercial ventures. Nearly
four-fifths of it is in stock; and at any rate
it isn’t a stock that is liable to go suddenly
out of fashion or for which there won’t be
any demand to speak of in the event of a
bad slump. Further, the goodwill, etc., is
now almost counterbalanced by accumu-
lated profits; yet nobody would be foolish
enough to say that the Mick Simmons
-business connection isn’t worth a lot of
money. The liabilities total £30,896. On
the other side there are stock £87,363;
fixtures, plant, etc., £20,208; book debts,
£37,827; and cash and sundries £6lll.
Fairly solid stuff, on the whole. Yet there
are millions of men who couldn’t make any
profit even if they had this stock. Manage-
, ment —that’s the asset that makes 15 p.c.
' profits. And unfortunately it is the asset
that you can’t nail down, and say, “Ah
well, now we’ve got it for ever.”

A personal note from the largest authority
on zinc production in Britain :—•
Everyone is having a go at spelter, and there will
be some sore heads when the war ends, for the ordi-
nary commercial channels will be quite insufficient
to carry off this flood of metal. ’The U.S.A. smelters
alone are now nearly equal to the supply of the
whole of the world’s normal requirements, while
Japan, Holland and even Russia are on the go as
well. So far as Britain is concerned nobody need
worry about the establishment of a really permanent
industry until thorough organisation, rectification of
railway rates and other matters have been tackled
and settled. And all of these don’t amount to a
row of peas unless a thoroug-hly-efficient tariff be
adopted—not merely one of name and academic in-
terest, but one that acts: say, ad valorem, little or
no duty on spelter at £3O or over, increasing as the
price goes down, until at say £2O it reaches £lO a
ton. This would cripple the dumper. Trifling-
bonuses and 21 p.c. duties merely play with the
question.
If that is the position in Britain, Heaven
help the unprotected business in Australia !

Inky Way, from Far North in Australia to
Far South in Maoriland. When he was
dealing with “King Dick” Seddon in the

The Bulletin described him this way
Lukin sitting in the King’s gate is a veritable
Mordecai to the M.L. Haman. As Dick could not
order a gallows for his enemy, he tried another
method of silencing him. Through an obliging inter-
mediary he hinted that if his enemy became a good
boy he stood a good show of being made a C.M.G.
for distinguished service on the press. At which
Lukin snorted derisively.
I can hear that snort yet!

“H. 0.” : Apropos the Dublin riots, a fair-
sized volume could be written on the Perils
of Being Born a Poet. With the exception
of James Connolly, the head and front of
the upending were poets. Joseph Plunkett,
the story of whose marriage on the eve of
his execution was featured in the cables,
was at one time editor of the Irish Re-
view (to which Miss Gifford, the girl he
married, contributed clever caricatures), and
he published a volume of mystical verse,
“The Circle and the Sword.” His brother-
in-law, Professor T. MacDonagh, who was
shot, produced a book on English metrics,
four books of verse (“April and May,”
“Lyrical Poems,” “Songs of “Myself” and
“Through the Ivory Gate”) and a play,
“When the Dawn Has Come,” which was
staged at the Abbey Theatre. Patrick
Pearse, the '“President of the Irish Repub-
lic” (shot), wrote verse and plays in Irish
and English. . Ilis morality play, “Little
Jesus,” attracted a good deal of. attention
some time back. Countess Markieviez was
a sister of the well-known Irish poetess.
Eva Gore Booth. The Countess herself
made something of a name as a painter and
pushed a vigorous pen, but I have never
come across any verse above her signature.
Her husband, a Polish painter, wrote “The
Memory of the Dead” and other Irish plays,
in which his eccentric spouse acted.
Even Roger Casement has contributed
poemlets to the Irish Review. Fortu-
nately Padraic Colum, the most notable
representative of the modern Irish school
of poetry, and a close friend of all the
leading revolutionists, was in the U.S.A.
when the trouble broke out.

“Max”: In the sacred interests of litera-
ture, let The Bulletin help the S. M.
’Erald in boosting its new Slaughter-Serial:
There- is no need to introduce Headon Hill, the
author of our new story, to our readers. He has
established a flue reputation as the author of “Millions
Mischief,” “A Traitor’s Wooing,” “A Crimson Honey-
moon” and other stories.... It [the new story ] lias
to do with a murder in Hampshire—the murder ot
Sir Trevor Trafford, of Trafford Abbey....
’Strewth! What a blugthirsty old lady it
is! Who would believe that she feels qualm-
ish at the Gruesome Scenes of Horror in the
censorable movies? And “A Crimson
Honeymoon”—oh, naughty, naughty .
’** * *
“Copy Boy”: There was scarcely a Hay-
seed in Victoria unacquainted with journal-
ist Joe Dreyer, who has just spiked his last
copy. Meningitis "was the tiouble, and tho
end came with merciful swiftness. Beloie
settling down to the job of agricowtuial re-
porter on the Leader, which he held at the
time of his death, Dreyer was a surveyor.
He was born in Maoriland, but it was while
in Westx*alia that he evinced an interest in
the soil, the cow and the pumpkin, fcoon he
was recognised as an expert on tliese en-
grossing matters, and shortly after, coming
to Victoria, was captured by the Leader.
About the most tireless delver into the old-
time records of the Ma State is V illiain
Frearne, of Westmead (N.S.W.), who lias
just published another of his local histories
—this time “On Old South Creek.” Freame
is his own publisher and aistributor, hump-
ing his books round to likely purchasers till
the whole edition is worked oft'; and he
finds his buyers in sufficient numbers to keep
the business bi’isk. Church records and
tombstones are his speciality, and he bulges
over with family details of all the inhabitants
of every cemetery within 50 miles of Sydney.
Between whiles, he works at his trade as
carpenter in Parramatta, whex*e he has
started a local historical society.
* * * *
“Billie Bullett”: Can anyone tell me what
precisely are the objects of that really pre-
cise body, the N. S. Wales Institute of
Journalists? I’ve been a member now for
two years and, beyond welcoming visiting
pressmen and other distinguished globe-
trotters and cutting out the yearly subscrip-
tion in four quarterly feeds, I can’t under-
stand it. Perhaps the journalists have a
quarterly yearning to be addressed by the edi-
tor of S.M.H.. while they bask in the smile
(socially) of “Mr. J. 0.” and “Mr. Geoffrey.”
At present there is a suspicion among the
rank and file that the committee is, or has
been, vindicating one of the membei'S against
a Parliamentary attack, but, if so, it is men-
tioned only in whispers to the committee’s
closest relations. At the annual meeting the
other evening the food was unusually good,
but the shadow of Hunter-street dimmed the
brightness of the lights. In a quagmire of
dreary speeches Dr. “Whiskers” Ward stood
out as the only personality. By the way.
wool at 3s. per lb. has apparently proved
too great a temptation, and the whiskers
have been marketed at last. The Doctor s
beard is now but an indifferent affair.
A new Melbourne monthly, The Reper-
torian, is to step delicately out, like Agag,
within the next few weeks, and hopes to
diffuse kultur at 6d. a time. The mag. is
being edited by Ralph Ainge-Johnson, for-
merly of the Argus ; and Louis Essou.
Archibald T. Strong, Harrison Owen aixd
Guy Innes will have something to say in
the first issue if they can be induced to
spike their copy in time.
“Exile”: Recollect Edmund Mitchell,
once on the Age staff in Melbourne and
London? He has had a most interesting
wander around the earth since he left Aus-
tralia- —where the late 11. E. N. Twopenny
helped him to found the Pastoralists’
Review. I-Ie has worked on the Glasgow
Herald, the Times of India and the Los
Angeles Times ; has written 12 novels and
perpetrated a one-act comedy; has travelled
all over the Orient lecturing and writing,
and is now settled in Los Angeles, where
he takes a prominent part in running the
Allies’ Aid Association and the Celtic and
Caledonian Clubs.
* . » *
“Abbrev.”: I observe cryptic headlines in
the S. M. Herald : “A.T.N.A. Report,”
“U.S.L. Meets,” and so on. Advt. condensa-
tion gaining ground. How long bef. the
lid's ldg. arts, arc prtd. in abr. form?
“The Galloping Bug”: Whether Hugh
Mahon gave way to an unusual burst of
candor, or the Argus for once was wallop-
ing its joss, is not clear. Whatever the
cause, it looks like contempt of court for
the Argus (25/7/T6) to make the Federal
Attorney-General, talking of arbitration
tribunals, refer to “normal times, or when
judicial fiats cause no widespread hard-
ship.” However, flat or fiat, costs will pile
up just the same.
* * * *
“J. 8.”: Thus Charlie Bean, Australia’s
official war correspondent and the most
modest sundowner on the Inky Way:—
The line went straight through the German-shrap-
nel as if the pellets were raindrops. . . .When I left
the battlefield, etc.— {Cable, 22/7/'IC.)
Bean wrote that line “When I left the
battlefield” in the engrossment of his work.
If anybody were to charge him with being
on the place within the meaning of the Act,
his blushes would melt the barb-wire
entanglements. .Pressmen don’t pass • the
jam to one another —anyhow, not in Aus-
tralia—but I say about Bean Well,
never mind what I say.
* * * *
“Harrison O.”: How doth the lady
journalist employ the shining hours? She
sits within her room, which sports a mirror
and some flowers, and in the most illegible
of scrawls invented yet describes the useless
doings of the Very Naicest set, in a strange,
fantastic lingo, copyrighted by the wench,
that is never really English, but is some-
times nearly French. She will tell of
dresses purchased at the maison This or
That and worn with espieglerie with some
new kind of hat; of maidens chic in muslin
she wall burble with delight, and she dubs a
robe de nuit the thing that women wear at
night; while, it seems, a rob'e de chambre
is that floppy overall that makes the trades-
men sorrow for the boss each time they
call. And the gifted lady writer can be
just as French and sweet when she tells us
of the things that all the naicest people eat
—of the pot age, and the entree, arid the
prtie-gordknowswliich encountered in de-
jeuners at the salons of the rich. The dear-
girl sits within her room and gushes of them
all, and always writes down salle when
she’s referring to a hall; and she gets to
loathe the sub. who runs his pencil through
her French, since to part with one small
esprit is to her a frightful wrench, for she
never can be taught to give her foreign lore
a rest; words the comp, sets in italics are
the ones she loves the best. But, in spite of
all her culture, she has never learnt to spell,
and the bloke who has to “sub” her yearns
for somebody to tell how it is that, in con-
ferring on a miss or matron fame, no mat-
ter, it appears, how simple is the person’s
name, the she-scribe will with awful inge-
nuity contrive to spell that name four
difl'Tent ways, at least, or even five!
BEQUEATHAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The night-birds cry in the bush outside,
And I write here, though the hour be late;
And what shall I write of the man who died ?
“He gave his gold to the poor at the gate!
The line is written. Was that his all, \
And did that all exhaust his love ?
“Nay, nay, write on, while the night-birds call:
‘He gave his soul to his God above’!”
Say on; for in so, rich a vein v
More gold lay waiting to be proved.
“ 'Twas so! Write this, and write it plain:
‘He gave his heart to the wife he loved’!”
What more? “What more dost thou require?
What more was left to give or take?
Yet more there was. Write this in fire:
‘He gave his life for his country’s sake’!”
“Last gift of all, with courage fine,
Though far from stars that watched his birth,
He fell. Write then this final line:
‘He gave his clay to the alien earth’!”
x.s.w.
RODERIC QUINN.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The other day. on a deputation, Matthews,
M.P., questioned Treasurer Higgs’s innuendo
about the “slowing down” policy, and reaped
the retort, “Since you challenge my state-
ment. let me refer you to the Government
Clothing Factory, where the output was
decreased by 50 per cent.” “That.” replied
Matthews, "was caused directly by the mana-
ger. It was his own fault.” Possibly; but
the slowing down caused a dead loss of some
thousands of pounds, and the manager didn’t
have to pay that bill. Next time, the man
who brings Matthews bis meat has a row
with his unjust boss, this paper trusts that
the man will throw half Matthews’s Sunday
roast to the dog. while charging Matthews
for the lot. Then Matthews will probably
see the beauty of the man’s way of dealing
with an unjust boss.
THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST.
LUKE.
Treading on the delicate ground of the future of
Australia as regards military service, Mr. Hughes
said he was sure the people realised that what was
necessary would be done. “Of this you may rest
assured,” lie said, “that so far as the light is re-
vealed to ine, 1 shall follow it no matter where it
goes.”— Mr. Ilur/hcs, to the Adelaide Chamber of
Commerce. ‘
Australia: “No, Billy; your first job.is ‘to
give light to then, that sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, to guide
our feet into the way of peace.’ ”
Attorney-General Herdman. of Maoriland.
answering a yell the other day for six o’clock
closing, gave seven large snorts of derision
and informed the horrified Stiggins that in
his judgment the time was about ripe to toss
the local accumulation of law bearing on
booze and Bung on the serapheap. Where-
upon there were wails of anguish from the
water-waggon, and Stiggins called on the
Reehabites to gird up their loins for the
fray. Herdman, a well-nourished person who
views Stiggins with sour disfavor, is about
right. All this mess of law is based upon the
foundation of a permanent scrap between
brewers and parsons, the public selection
being limited to choice between allowing Pri-
vate Enterprise to Jill ’em up again and
sweeping all booze into the Pacific. Conse-
quently there is a wild struggle every year
between Bung to keep possession of the beer-
WIPING IT OFF THE SLATE.
THE BOSS: “Look here, little man, as you’re
not making any effort to square up your
account, but only getting deeper in debt,
I’m just going to fare what there is
worth taking out of your wretched hide.”
pump and Wowser to get at the hogsheads
with an auger. But the idea that the State
has a possible interest in this business and
that the community cannot eternally be sev-
ered into two gangs of eampfollowers cheer-
ing wildly the one for Bung and the other
for McSnuffle has been growing for quite a
long time.
In Melbourne, at a meeting at which Solly,
M.L.A., advised the workers to organise a
monster deputation to the Premier, it was
resolved: —-
That this meeting of allied trades and callings,
representative of both employees and employers,
earnestly protest.; against any curtailment of racing
fixtures, being of opinion that the enforcement of such
would be detrimental to the interests of the working
community at the present juncture, when every outlet
is needed to absorb the surplus labor.
What appalling ignorance it discloses! The
country doesn’t want to invent “outlets” for
absorbing labor. It wants to make every
man produce his own living; and when a
Labor member attends a meeting of mostly-
parasites and advises monster demonstra-
tions to the Premier, it is a pretty good proof
that he doesn’t know what the Labor move-
ment really is—or is prepared to conveni-
ently forget it.
It is still a great thing to have had C. C.
Kingston in the neighborhood. He it was
who taught the S. Australian Parliament
to be impatient, towards many of the tire-
some things that others put up with. It
was he who popularised the “Sudden death”
no-confidence motion. Now his old Com-
missioner of Crown Lands, Larry
O’Loughlin, has tabled a motion in the
Assembly declaring that with a few speci-
fied exceptions all speeches shall be limited
to 30 minutes in the House and 10 in Com-
mittee. O’Loughlin was at one time
Speaker of the Assembly, and can argue as
one who has suffered without being able to
escape.
Holman's main contribution to the debate
in N.S.W.- Assembly about the return of
Griffith was the remark that members of
Cabinet welcomed Griffith back to the Mini-
stry. Yes. But Holman quite overlooked
mentioning whether the Executive had
directed Griffith to go ahead and nationalise
the petrol industry some more.
McKay, of the Harvester works, one of the
most successful manufacturers in Australia,
has given a nasty'if unintentional knock to the
Commonwealth Government’s scheme of an
Industrial Commission to U.S.A. Like every
other manufacturer, McKay wants to know
what others are doing, but he also knows that
the only way to find out the things that are
worth while is to send a specialist. His
latest emissary “abroad” is Sam Hutchinson,
of Warracknabeal, who has spent a lifetime
learning what the farmer wants. Vic.’s
Minister of Agriculture is a brother of his.
Melbourne may follow the late Bent’s
example and take off its hat to the Cow.
Largely as a result of the beast’s facility in
placing masses of flesh on its bones, the
Board of Works rate has been lowered to
the citizens this year by 3d. in the £l. Last
financial year’s receipts
from the 6000-acre Wer-
ribee sewage farm were
£102,400, chiefly from
the sale of fat cattle and
podgy sheep. Deducting
working expenses and
interest on the capital,
there was a net profit of
£14.686. But that was
only the profit to the
scheme. The profit to
Australia was infinitely
greater; it amounted to
the full value of the stuff
that was produced. Every
time a man grows a cab-
bage in his back yard the
country is the richer by a
cabbage, even though the
actual grower can’t see
any profit in it at all.
The State shipbuilding
yards at Williamstown
(Vic.) are in a gloomy
condition. They made a
bit of money lately fitting
up transports, but now
work is short and vari-
ous people are kicking.
When Honorary Minister
Baillieu was tackled
about the yards he said
the State Government
had to run them because
Private Enterprise would
not take the job on, but
if any private eo. would
take them over and work
them a deal would soon
be fixed up. The private
co. hasn’t shown up yet.
But the Federal Ministry
is being egged on to take over the yards, and
if it makes a good offer Peacock will jump
at it.
Vida Goldstein’s intentions are all right,
but her methods are horrible. Having no
doubt been warned off her “peace” crusade,
and being thus unable to do any more for
Germany that way, she has taken up arms
in the interests of venereal disease, and is
now serving pur enemies this other way.
She has protested to the Commonwealth
Government against compulsory notification,
her idea apparently being that if you’ve got
a particularly horrible disease, which is
easily communicable to others and which
afflicts not only the one who contracts it but
succeeding generations as well, the right
thing to do is to do what you please. Why
you shouldn’t also do it with plague, dyna-
mite, smallpox, leprosy, wild tigers, cabbage-
water and other unpleasant things, the Vida
Goldstein school never mentions.
“FADER, ARE VE STILL VINNING?”
THE FISHER OF ME N.
GOULBRIAN, Thursday.—The Government is send-
ing 2½ tons of cleaned and gutted fish, taken by the
State "trawlers, to be auctioned to-morrow morning.
THE FISHERMAN: “Lady, in order to pop-
ularise our brand of legislation, we pro-
pose, just before each general election,
to give you an opportunity of purchas-
ing some cheap fish.”
Why not a “Gentle to Germany - ’ League
and have done with it? Premier Peacock,
when discussing the proposed Federal Bill
for the disfranchisement of aliens of enemy
origin, made it clear that the Vic. Ministry
did not propose to submit a similar measure,
and proceeded sententiously that no action
should be taken which they “might have rea-
son to reproach themselves with after the
War.” Of course; that was a slip of the
tongue. Peacock meant “after the elections.”
Wilson, the new Westralian Premier, takes
his old job of Treasurer, lie, Mitchell and
Connolly (Hon. Minister) were in the last
Liberal team, and Lefroy held a portfolio
in the dim past. George and R. T. Robin-
son, K.C., the other Ministers in the
Assembly, are new to office; but the former
was once Railways Commissioner. Colebatch
(Colonial Secretary) and Atlielstan Saw.
M.D.. will bear the Ministerial burden in
the Council. Colebatch, a country news-
paper proprietor and an old working press-
man, is widely considered the strongest man
on the Liberal side of politics—though to
call the latter-day Colebatch a Liberal is
becoming absurd. Saw, new to politics, did
good work last session in helping to shape
the Westralian Venereal Diseases Act. The
team is about as strong as Wilson could
have got together from a mediocre crowd;
and it depends for existence upon the pre-
carious goodwill of the Country party of
eight and the Bertie Johnston party of one.
The “farmers’ friends” are sworn to abjure
office until they can command a majority in
the House. There are signs that they are
beginning to look coldly on this splendid
isolation, and it is likely that an effort will
be made before long to arrange a Liberal-
Country party coalition.
Melbourne papers have been asking the
public to stand off and admire the tremen-
dous job which is being done at the Heads.
where, after 2 $ years’ toil, a quar-
ter-mile swathe has been deepened
from 37 to 40 feet, and the gangs,
who can really work for only a
few . minutes a day, are getting
ready to blast out another 3ft. But
of all the thousands of tons of
rock that has been blasted out, not
a pebble is thrown at the mad
congestion policy which bleeds a
whole State for millions to be
spent in creating artificial ports
on a coast where there are fine
natural harbors already.
At the Melbourne Botanic Gar-
dens there’s a melancholy morgue,
labelled “Museum of Economic
Botany,” showing the corpses of
what should be live Australian in-
dustries. There are 60 varieties
of paper and millboard iiiade from
locally-grown plants, some of which
have d-cided possibilities; there
are dozens of fibres for rope and
string, including the sisal hemp
that we get from Yucatan via
U.S.A. There are corks made from
locally-grown cork-oaks, dye from
the blood wood of N.S.W., lamp-
black from the “sheathed rush” of
Vie. and N.S.W., resin described
as “antiseptic and febrifuge” from
the red-gum of Vic., and dozens of
other odds and ends that we ought
to be making good use of, instead of buying
for the profit and aggrandisement of our
actual and potential enemies.
AFTER TWO YEARS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
la equal might of flame and tempered steel
Long months the battle stood in east and west.
Xow something yields. The Teutons slowly reel
Before Titanic force that knows no rest.
From trench to trench, from corpse-strewn wood and
hill;
Doom moves with tireless and unaltered will.
The end is sure. There can be no return
Of that vast dread that held the world in awe.
Humanity triumphant still can spurn
From her high path the breaker of her law.
Months, years may run, but the high task remains.
Till earth is free of menace and of chains.
This hour has filled us with a golden hope,
(Jay as the warm, sweet wind that breathes the
spring
Through tossing gold of wattle on the slope
Of some bright valley where all birds may sing.
Clear as the doom that hangs above Berlin
Is our white faith in Man with worlds to win.
Two years ago force held the mastery -
Force linked in arms to tyranny and shame —
But Truth, undaunted, looked afar to see
The legions mustering »n her holy name.
They rose, they gathered, eager for the fray,
And Truth is mistress of the world to-day.
Shall all truth win? Oh, ye of little faith!
The fool and braggart trickster have their day.
Wrong rules as right; the world With woe and
scat he
Bears its slow burden down the dusty way—
But Man is victor, though the pale years weep :

The Story of the Lamp
a
Amongst the Ancient Greeks,
950 B.G.
In the Greece that Homer has immortal-
ised in verse, lamps were in regular use, for
the bard sings of a “Festival of Lamps.” The
Lamps of Ancient Greece, were made of
pottery or metal. Grecian maidens used to
set lighted lamps before the oracles when
they wished to consult them. Whilst this
custom no longer prevails, the trimming and
care of her lamps is an important part of
many a housewife’s duties.

SPORTING
NOTIONS `
The Australian Hurdle Race at Caulfield
last Saturday was made particularly interesting in
the last mile by the bold effort of Rathfarnliam, ironi
Ballarat, who promised to repeat his Grand Natl
performance of last year. Rath, lasted long, enough
in the lead to dispel the popular notion that his
G.N. victory was a fluke. But at the final hurdle
Van Homreigh flew past him, and the race was
over. The Dutchman won by three lengths. Obi
came with a belated run and beat the tiring Rath-
farnham by a neck. The favorite Wisconsin came to
grief : so did Lord Gray; and Jack Rice ran off, in
accordance with his Melbourne custom.
Van Homreigh is undoubtedly a brilliant hurdler
on his best day, and a great stayer. He flies over
the sticks as Clontaft did of yore. His second to
Jullundur in the National last month was a good
performance under unlucky conditions. Since then he
lias improved a lot, and it may be taken for granted
that Jullundur’s breakdown, early last week, made
no difference to Saturday’s result. But Van has a
long way to go before he can approach the record
of old Obi- —two wins and a third in .the Grand
National, and two seconds in the Australian Hurdle
Race.
With Bullawarra broken down and Booligal under
vague suspicion, there is nothing among the top
weights for the Australian Steeple that any reason-
able punter can swear by. In the 10- to 11-stone
class Rendrock and Battleship look more dangerous
than Westaway; and among the lighter weights Busra
and Glenquinn (from Sydney) are preferable to
Highland Clan, who seems to have gone off coloi'.
Last week this paper suggested Busra and Battle-
ship, though both of them are handicapped by their
littleness. Battleship’s lOst. 111 b. is 161 b. more than
he carried to victory last year, when he probably
was more fully wound up than he is now. On
Saturday, after running in the Steeplechaser's Flat
Race, the burly son of Flagship sweated freely,
whereas Busra seemed ready for another gallop. A
week’s work may do wonders for Battleship, and the
writer is loth to lose confidence in the plain-looking,
big-hearted pony. Nothing but bad luck, or want of
condition, can stop a plucky one like him from
nutting in his best work in the fourth mile. Little
Busra, who also has a stayer’s pedigree, is fancied
on the assumption that he got an unlucky set-back in
the G. N. Steeple the other week. He finished only
fifth on that occasion, and he meets Rendrock, who
finished second, on 111 b. better terms. Busra and
Battleship are at least as well worth backing as any
of them.

One of the hardiest leppers in business
passed out when El Progreso broke himself by
falling in Moondah Steeple at Caulfield on Saturday,
lie was regarded as one of the safest conveyances in
Australia over fences. El Progreso hailed from a South
Australian farm, and had been rushed about the Com-
monwealth in a fashion which would have tried the
constitution of a commercial traveller. About his
best performance was early this year. First he won
a steeple at Randwick. The same day he was hoisted
aboard a steamer for Melbourne, and on arrival was
railed to Warrnambool. There he appropriated the
cash attached to the big jumping event of that town
four days after winning at Randwick. There should
be some oats for him where the good horses go.

Punters had another fairly good day at
Canterbury Park (Sydney) last week. In the six
races the actual favorite won three times and a
second favorite once. But in the Cup, a mile and
three furlongs event, 17 starters, a lot of cash was
dropped in the wrong place, most of it going on
Bay Rum (3’s) and Coat-o’-Mail (s’s). Bay Rum, an
imnorted nag, had Bst. 21b. aboard. He raced well
in England, but since changing his address has
shown no excuse for being pursued with coin. Chal-
lenge Cross started at 10’s, with apprentice Crockett
in charge (7st. minus 71b. allowance), and won with
nothing to spare from a rank outsider, Tarpaulin;
who pushed into the argument half-way down the
straight. Challenge Cross didn’t owe owner Pick
anything when the saddle was pulled off. It was the
horse’s second win since Pick bought him for 300
guineas a few months ago.

Lord Malt, who pushed his head out just
far enough to beat the unlucky La Balfour in the
Moorefield (Sydney) Flying Handicap on Saturday,
was at one time in Mark Thompson’s stable and has
had a share of wins. The nag has had two runs
for the present owner, the previous effort being a
second. 11. Con lon, Lord Malt’s proprietor, has
therefore secured a sprinter above the ordinary, and
no matter what occurs has apparently become pos-
sessed of some cheap horseflesh. Conlon owned the
one-time crack sprinter Maltchester. Lord Malt is
a four-year-old gelding, but at the beginning, of
last season, when he landed a couple of events, he
was a colt. La Balfour, the animal which was not
quite good enough to beat Lord Malt, finished a
close second at Warwick Farm recently, and was
then taken to Grafton, where he managed to win a
sprint event. But as he was beaten on the previous
day the profits from the mission were small.

This page remarked a week or so ago
that the Maoriland mare Bee would be worth watch-
ing when she stripped for something over a mile.
Well, Bee was undressed for the Warwick Farm
(Sydney) Handicap on Monday, and at the finish
cantered in alone, attended at a respectful distance
by W.L.S., winner of the principal event at Moore-
field on Saturday. Bee started at 7 to 2. She came
across the Tasman with a record of having won at
five furlongs and a mile and a half, among her wins
being the Wellington Cup with 7st. 81b. and the
Racing Club Handicap with Bst. 81b. Before
Monday she had run in three sprints at Sydney, and
usually faded out in the run home, as nags that are
being prepared for a distance often do. McClusky
was in the saddle at Warwick Farm —his first ride
for three years. After he had weighed in at 9st. 21b.
the question of what the mare is weighted at in the
Metronolitan became interesting. The card shows
Bst. 91b. Ikcy at once shortened the pi-ice.
* *• * *
Ike had got himself so scared by the end
of last week that he assembled in a dim, religious
light somewhere and piously prayed for strength to
sustain him until the A.J.C. meeting at Randwick.
The punter had again been winning at Canterbury
Park and Moorefield, five firsts at the latter meeting
being well backed. All the same, Ike is not going
to lie torn from his capital without putting up a
fight, and mostly he lias determined to accept the
advice of Treasurer Higgs and economise. The
thoroughness with which the majority of book-
makers are cramping the odds is just plain murder,
and the punter brandishing a handful of cash for a
big bet on a suburban course has Buckley’s chancN
of getting a fair price. The moment what looks
like a commission appears in the ring, the wireless
gets to work and turns the -market upside down in
an instant. The only chance the “heads” have of
getting on is to employ half a dozen agents, who
at the word “go” leap simultaneously into Israel
and take whatever the moment oilers. Thoughts of
what the fielders will be offering at Randwick are
enough to drive the average punter to the war,
where the risks are infinitely less.

Only those punters who believe in the
axiom “The bigger the field the bigger the cer-
tainty” could have felt on good terms with them-
selves of late at Vic. race-meetings. Fields get
bigger and bigger, and ordinary backers have found
the job of picking ’em more puzzling than ever.
At Moonee Valley the other Saturday there were
124 starters—a record for the course. The pre-
vious best at the Valley was a total of 118. On
both of these occasions, however, programmes
swelled to seven events. Caulfield holds a six-races
record of 114 starters. There were 113 runners
for six events at Flemington on Carbine’s Cup day.
N. S. Wales beat that with 128 starters for a half-
dozen events at Rosehill. But all these records fall
away before the English total of 212 starters (seven
events) on the opening day of the First Extra Meet-
ing at Newmarket last year.

W. Lillyman, alleged to be one of the
wealthiest Australian mannikins, had a profitable
time during the N.S.W. turf season which finished
last month. At Sydney and metropolitan meetings
Lillyman steered 25 winners; outside the metropolis
he had 344 successes. But just when the season’s
books were on the point of closing, the stipendiary
stewards at Menangle (N.S.W.) judged him guilty
of crossing and passed him into outer darkness
until October I—too late to have a share in the
A.J.C. Spring Meeting.

The most successful ri ~ r in the racing
season just concluded in Vic. was Frank Dempsey.
His record was 47 wins, 27 seconds and 26 thirds,
which, in view of the reduced number of race-meet-
ings, is more than respectable. Punters may reckon
it worth knowing that in the last couple of months
Dempsey has ridden winners of the “last race” 11
times.
The world’s most remarkable racecourse
combination distinguished itself again last week at
one of the Sydney pony meetings. The 14.2 Home
Rule, owned by J. Bull, and ridden by Kitchener,
started 'favorite and won easilv in his class.

Racing is certainly not overdone in South
Aus. A. E. Bowman was the only owner to win 10
races in the season just ended, and they did not give
him a four-figure total. Mrs. R. M. Hawker (with
Cyklon, mostly) heads the list with £2070 ; Tait
next, £1675; then Hamilton, Owen, “Rawdon,”
Williams, James and Spencer, Young, Keily, Hawker,
Bowman. Pistol comes easily first as a winning
sire; his g’et landed £9700. Bobadil and Spear-
mint also ran. J. V. Hopwood (354 wins) was most
successful jockey Sing, Bissett, Liddle and Ringer
next. As trainer, W. T. Hopwood, with 194, gets
home by half a, race from Howie ; J. James a good
third. V,

“Squeal” ; Rotten displays made in hurdle
races lately revive the old question whether an
animal which cannot jump or only jumps sometimes
should be allowed to start in these events. There is
always a terrible risk in hurdling, and if anyone can
show it to be an even decent thing to add to this by
letting loose an animal which can be relied upon to
endanger several lives he ought to come forward.
Before a horse was nominated for a hurdle race or
steeple the owner should be required to satisfy some
responsible person that the nag was reasonably pro-
ficient in the business of getting over things in a
hurry.
“Pic-k”: Yes, handicapping is mostly a
rule-of-thumb business, but sometimes the bull’s-eve
is hit fair in the middle, Here’s an unrecorded
record. At Bombala (N.S.W.) the final heat of the
£lOO handicap footrace in ’B4 caused four successive
dead-heats between Jack Brindle, a murky cham.
from Craigie, who was on scratch, and G. O. Baldwin,
a Delegate sprinter, who hopped off syds. It looked
as if the pair would keep on running until one of
them perished from senile decay, but in the fifth
dash for the cash Brindle got a flying start and
headed the procession to within a yard of the tape.
Then he collapsed, and before anyone knew what had
happened Baldwin flashed past and gathered in the
spoil.

If horses had thumbs it would be easy
enough, but as they haven’t it looks as if the A.J.C.
or the police should offer a reward for the dis-
covery of some method by which horses can be
identified and the particulars filed away for refer-
ence. Have the possibilities of hoof-print or muzzle-
print ever been investigated ? A case now
before N.S.W. Full Court, in which Judges are asked
to decide whether a nag sold in the Baekhlocks is
named Tummer or Eurra, is another reminder that
the matter requires looking into. The plaintiff in
the case alleges that he bought Tummer, and the
other prad was delivered. The defendant that
plaintiff got Tummer. To. have to employ a Bench
at about £2OO a week and push several wigs into
the fray seems a fairly expensive method of settling
a question like this, even if it were one the afore-
said collection of wisdom could be suspected of
being able to decide. Incidentally, another case of
mislaid horse was mentioned the other day. In this
a South Aus. breeder bought in England a mare
named Longuevi lie, and a Ma State man purchased a
mare named Failing Brook. After- a few months
they discovered that each had the wrong lady. The

After determining to hold fortnightly meet-
ings turn-about, the two registered race clubs at
Kalgoorlie and Boulder proceeded to deal with their
unregistered rivals. They lately bought the latter’s
two courses for £l5OO, and there is an honorable
understanding that horses hitherto outside the fold
will be whitewashed. The owner of the two courses
in question (said to be John Wren) was wise to
sell out. With the orthodox against him, he would
soon have lost more money than he formerly made
cut of the poorlv equipped concerns. Meanwhile
Dr. P. F. L. Sawell has resigned from the presidency
of Boulder Club, as a protest against the innovation
of fortnightly meetings. The new move, he con-
tends, is contrary to the spirit in which the club
was founded, and would lead to less clean sport.
Probably he is right. Anyway, it is certain that
the population is not large enough to stand 28 good
meetings in the year. There is too much room for
the spieler and other undesirables in such an arrange-
ment.

The 41st issue of J. ,T. Miller’s Sporting
Pamphlet is further evidence of the number of
foreign-bred horses entered for the big handicaps, and
it looks as though Melbourne Cup for the first time
may fall to a gee that has been raced in England.
Comedy King, the only English-born winner of the
Cup thusfar, was a baby when he crossed the sea.
Miller’s pamphlet mentions that Carlita and Woorak
ye the biggest winners of the cracks now in training.

of Fanny Durack, champion swimmer, gives a touch
of nature to the little book.

An old identity of the Sydney Show-
ground and of many country shows passed out at
Blarney on July 26. This was the famous old
hunter' Desmond. He was about 30 years of age and
had he been a biped would have had a breast
covered with medals and trophies. Bred near Ben-
alla ‘ (Vic.), he passed through many hands before
reaching those of H. D. Morton. When that
sport broke up his stud the champion passed into the
hands of A. Judd, who carefully provided for the
old age of the veteran.* He must have won £5OOO
in the show ring.

Last week the hare which didn’t scoot for
the escapes at Rooty Hill (N.S.W.) and get there
first was turned into meat before it knew what had
happened. Most of the animals refused to delay and
argue the point with what was coming behind—a
pair of lithe, bounding dogs with gleaming teeth. The
Waterloo Cup meeting of the Ma State’s Coursing
Association was on, and skin and fur were flying.
The winner turned up in S. S. Bennett’s black dog
Benediction, an animal which seldom gives a hare
time to say its prayers. He has never j'et had a
flag raised against him and was the hottest favorite
that has ever won the cup. Bennett also won the
Plate with Batlow, a full brother to Benediction.
These quadrupeds are by the imported dog White
Hope from Black Cygnet. H. L. McDonald’s Aspired,
winner of the Purse, and Achieved, runner-up in
the Cup, also call White Hope “dad.”
As there is a suspicion that the cheap,
universal motor-car will have an engine of the air-
cooled type, a Yankee car with an engine entirely
cooled by the atmosphere is interesting. The motor
is a 6-cvlindered 30-h.p. Round the base of the
engine there is a vacuum chamber kept partially in
that state through a
■fan on the flywheel

air out and hurling it
behind the car. The

And. The designer has
seen to it that the
only entrances are
special narrow ones
round the head of each
cylinder. By this sys-
tem each cylinder gets
the same amount of
fresh air, which isn’t
the case when the
engine is just rushed
at the atmosphere and
the rear cylinders are
handed the hot air
that bounces off the
front ones. Each cylin-
ders devours 2200f't. of
air per minute. Even

Dave Smith and Buck Crouse were the
penom.viT. outuxutui on rviturday; and an
astounding performance didii'jt take long to fi\ysh.
Ten seconds after they started Smith was reaching
out for the Yank’s scalp with the confidence and
speed of a champion, and Crouse was evading the
attack by leaving himself wide open and boxing
with the deliberation of an alderman. For all prac-
tical purposes Smith might as well have been opposed
by a beginner. At the end of the first round Crouse
was down and almost out ; when the second ended he
forgot where his:, corner was; in the third he kept
himself up by frantically hanging on ; in the fourth
he accepted more beans and a slumber punch. It had
been a conflict with only one in it, and was among
the rottenest seen at the Stadium for many days.
Three weeks ago these two men collided at the
same place. There was only one in that disturbance,
too. It was Crouse. Smith’s efforts at mixing it
then were calamitous, and the conclusion of practi-
cally everyone at the ringside was that he had com-
mitted a great error of judgment in trying that
line, and that only by reliance on boxing skill could
he expect to win through a second argument. This
time he mixed it again, but this time he did it with
great success. At the end the crowd leaped to its
feet and cheered and asserted that Smith was better
than ever. But Crouse’s cjjsplay was so deplorable
that to take the winner's form as a guide to probable
happenings when David next cuts loose on someone
else would be as premature as it was to regard the
first unpleasantness between these two as an indica-
tion of what was going to occur at the second.
And now for a word with “Snowy” Baker, and,
if John Wren’s sore car is better, with him.. That
fight was not good enough. The Bulletin, with
conviction, and it hopes not without force, has fre-
quently combated the demand of the wowser that
boxing should be prohibited. But a repetition of
Saturday night’s performance would cut the ground
from under the feet of the anti-Stiggins party and
turn the argument into an entirely new channel.

The braves of the Eastern Suburbs will
a chance on Saturday of lifting the N.S.W.
Rugby League’s City Cup for the third year in suc-
cession, but before the pot can be carried off Messen-
ger s old club will need to violently assault Glebe.
On last Saturday’s form it looks as if Glebe will
repeat its successes of 1914. The Eastern suburban-
ites are lucky to be in the final. The weak North
Sydney bunch almost put them out of the chase.
In that team was Sid Deane, the most-travelled foot-
baller in Australia. Deane first went to England in
1908 with the Kangaroos, and remained there to
play for Oldham (Lancashire) until ’l2, when he
returned to Sydney. After one season here he was
tempted back to the Cold Country to strip for Hull.
But as hoofball has become a very unprofitable pro-
fession in England lately owing to a more thrilling
game having been introduced by Kaiser Bill, Deane
lias wandered back to Australia. With him at Hull
were Steve Darmody (South Sydney), and Jimmy
Devereaux (North Sydney). Word came through
recently ■ that Darmody had left half a- foot in
France.

There’s a battle of the Car v. the Cycle in
progress over Colonel Vance's recent accident in
Melbourne. The doctor was riding a motor-bike and
came to grief—as various other not-too-voung mili-
tary meds. appear to have done when put on top of
the rapid two-wheeler. But in Vance’s ease it seems
that he purposely skidded to avoid a car which was
being driven furiously and without lights across a
corner. He suffered a bit, of course, but his own
idea is that, had he too been in a car, he would have
been “completely smashed up.”

Alf W, Dunlop is one of the marvels of
Australian lawn tennis. Nearly a quarter of a cen-
tury ago he -won a State championship. In 1914 he
swung a racquet (with A. F. Wilding, Norman
Brookes and S. Doust) that helped to bring the
Davis Cup back to Australia. Last week, to help a
war fund in Victoria, he partnered with A. E.
Sandral and defeated G. P. England and C. Buckley
by three sets to one. Sandral, by the way, is the
star of Scotch College, and is expected to make a
splash at the next State championships.

Eric Apperly and Larry Seely, who are
in the finals for the Manly (N.S.W.) championship,
are as unlike one another in their methods as each
of them is unlike any accepted golfing model. Seely
is an all-round athlete with a wonderful record, and
is not a long driver. Apperly is about as robust as a
daffodil, yet. when he gets properly on to his
drive he supplies his caddy with a telescope to follow
the flight, of the ball. Seely stands up straight and
swings short. Apperly crouches and makes a club
circle that would just about clear Kosciusko.
Apperly has a set of carefully-selected clubs that
made the mouths of English golfers water when he
was playing on the other side some time ago. Seely’s
pet putter is a thing he made out of a piece of gas-
pipc.

The hot-blooded ancients who wage
relentless war on the Sydney suburban bowling
greens arc girding up their loins for the a'nnual

Club won the “comp” and, to feloniously clip their
wings, so the -City men say, the district system is
being revived. At present a bowler can play any-
where he likes, provided he sticks to one club. City,
the oldest club, has its home in Cook Park. It long
ago attracted many strong players, none of whom
live near the battlefield, and they flatly refuse to
leave the club to play for remote suburbs in which
they happen to sleep. So far, they have been strong
enough to resist the “district” movement, but as the
old brigade drops out of the City Club the subur-
banites hope to get their own way.

“Ma’feesh”: When my grateful country
took back my battle-stained uniform and
offered me the usual £1 civilian suit, I said
to myself, “My boy. you have worn some
terrible fatigue costumes in your time, but
the jokes that are allowable on active ser-
vice don’t go in civil life. We’ve got to get
back to facts and work now, so low comedy

grinning trench-mate with a suspicious-look-

How to Treat Your Hair and Complexion.
A Few Simple Beauty Hints.
By Mdlle. GABY DESLYS, the welFknown Parisian Actress.
YOU ask mo for a few hints on the
treatment of the hair and complexion.
Well, the less "treatment” you give
thing is a good shampoo. Never use any-
thing inferior to wash the hair with. <tet
some good slailax from your chemist and use
the skin the better. I do not
believe much in massage, but a
little cream to the face is neces-
sary to counteract the effects of
wind or sun. What cream
would I recommend? Well, 1
advise you to use a little mer-
colised wax every night and
again in the morning, after
washing the face. Rub it
gently into the skin, then wipe
off any superfluous wax and
dust a little barri-agar over
the face. You will find that
this will be the only "treat-
ment” necessary and will keep
your face fresh and youthful-

a ionspoonful in a cup of hot
water. Then rinse the hair
well and it Avill look bright and
glossy,
A tonic is necessary when the
hair is inclined to fall out more
than it should, and is always
good to use during the spring
and autumn. Then the hair
needs a little —what do you call
it V —stimulant, and for this I
would advise you to get a packet
of boranium and mix it with
some bay rum ; dab this into the
roots and it will not only stop
the fall, but make your hair
grow long and thick. Give your
looking for all your life. The mercolised
wax removes all the dead outer skin, so
that, you have always a fair, fresh com-
plexion like a girl’s.
For the hair, the first and most important
hair a good brushing every night, and that
will be all that you need do.

Blackheads Fly Away.
Instantaneous Remedy for Blackheads, Greasy Skin and Enlarged Pores.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores,
recently discovered, is now coming into
general use in the boudoir. It is very
simple, harmless and pleasant. Drop a
stymol tablet, obtained at the chemist’s, in
a tumblerful of hot water. After the effer-
vescence has subsided bathe the face in the
liquid, using a small sponge or soft cloth.
In a few minutes dry the face and the offen-
sive blackheads will come right off on the
towel. Also the large oily pores immedi-
ately close up and efface themselves natu-
rally. The greasiness disappears and the
skin is left smooth, soft and cool. This
simple treatment is then repeated a few
times at intervals of four or five days, to
ensure the permanence of the result.
Grey Hair—Home Remedy.
An old-fashioned Recipe restores Youthful Appearance.
There are plenty of reasons why grey
hair is not desirable, and plenty of reasons
why hair dyes should not be used. But. on
the other hand, there is no reason why you
should have grey hair if you do not want
St. To turn the hair back to a natural color
is really a very simple matter. One has
only to get from the chemist two ounces of
ounceii irate of tammalite and mix it with
three ounces of bay rum. Apply to the
hair with a small sponge for a few nights
and the. greyness will gradually disappear.
This liquid is not sticky or greasy and does
not injure the hair in any way. It has been
used for generations with most satisfactory
results by those who have known the
formula.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
The most Effective Formula ever Discovered.
-Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
ro kill the hair roots permanently. For
this purpose pure powdered pheminol may be
applied directly to the objectionable hair
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the.
hair but also to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol. obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Good News for Fat People.
Something New ill Obesity Cures.
A London chemist says: "The latest
method of reducing obesity certainly is far
more pleasant and convenient than all pre-
vious methods. It consists merely in eating
clynol berries. The fat person who wants
to reduce without the usual rigid diet, exer-
cise, sweating baths, etc., now puts a few
of these little brown berries in his or her
pocket and eats three or four each day."
Clynol berries not only eliminate fat from
the body, but also correct the tendency.
which is usually constitutional, to create
fatty matter. Mo discomfort whatever is
caused by their action; in fact, except for
the loss of superfluous fat and the feeling
of “fitness” so created, you would not be
aware that these little berries were doing
their work.
Local inquiry shows that clynol berries are
not very well known in this country, but
the demand is increasing daily, and any
chemist can quickly procure them if specially
requested to do so.

ments from the critics for the vigor and ele-
gance of her elocution. Says one of them :
Assuredly the most wonderful performance that
has ever been afforded by an actress of close on

genuinely tragic figure. There were ease and
fervor together. The rhetoric seemed like her
natural language. How rarely one finds that nowa-
days 1

“Stargazer”: We have a tenor in Mel-
bourne just now who is an entertaining
addition to the city. He sings everything,
and even parades the Block trilling his
thoughts to Italian opera airs. I have
struck him in ft tea-room where lie was
ordering coffee and a bit of cake with sug-
gestions of “Gavftjlefja Rttsticatm,*’ and in
a drapery establishment Where he was buy-
ing socks iil fragments of “La Boheme”
and bints of “Carmen.” When the socks
offered were declared to be half a crown the
con, appassionato, effect was thrilling, but
liner still were the dolce touches when the
warbler found satisfactory footbags to be
available at orie-and-nine.

is an Austrian snigger at Montenegro—ol‘
perhaps it is Servia. The absurd Baron

Dauilo to capture the rich widow so that
her wealth shall not pass out of his im-
poverished country which has a national

“Masettd”: The production Of “Mignori”
and “II Barbiere” by Gonsalez reminds Us
that of ail the works staged this season the
heroines of these two aione live happily
afterward. They’re a very unlucky lot, the
soprano principals in opera. Take Our
visitors’ repertoire. Leonora says “Rather
than for thy rival live thus I die,” and
poisons herself. La Gioconda does some-
thing in the same line. Leonora (in “La
Favorita”) expires of grief. Carmen is
knifed. Gilda (“Rigoletto”) also meets a
violent end, but in her case the composer
allows her to sing a few notes before dying.
Lucia and Marguerite go mad and Butter-
fly suicides. Aida is buried alive. Tosca
leaps from the castle walls. Valentine in
“The Huguenots” is slain in a religious
disturbance. Desdemona is killed with
somebody’s patent bedding. Mimi and Vio-
letta die of consumption, and Santuzza is
supposed to die of shock. Rachel in
“L’Ebrea” is executed. AfteT this casualty
list it is pleasant to report that Amelia
(“Un Ballo”) survives; but even she is
“stricken by remorse” or croup or some-
thing. I suppose they have to end this way
to show it isn’t comic opera.
“The Gink” : I am no Stiggins, but, having
a young family to chaperone, I’ll hoist the
wowser’s ensign and put up barbed hymn-
book entanglements at the entrance of the

more of this. The loving wife, of the hero,
having embezzled funds entrusted to her
care, sells herself to a millionaire on
condition that he refunds the money.
When she arrives at the house to pay back
the money (her husband in the meantime
having made a fortune) the millionaire, after ;i
struggle, holds her down over a table while
he heats a brand to mark her with. This
brand it is previously explained means “This
belongs to me.” The primitive brutality of
the scene as he calmly burns it into'her
shoulder, her sudden stiffening and wild,
futile struggling as the burning iron bites
into her flesh, belongs to the human stock-
yard of the Dark Ages, .end whoever brought

HIGH day and holiday shoes, for wear on
extra-special occasions with the extra-
special gown, ought, one feels, to have
something distinctive about them, some-
thing that lifts them above the shoes for every-
day wear and tear. It is . this distinctive, this
different look, that makes the charm of the most
elegant shoes in the Bostock range, the delightful
little black satin shoe here illustrated, for ex-
ample. One has only to glance at the picture to see
that here is something very smart and desirable.
Then think of it on, showing daintily, captivat-
ingly, beneath the flounced or scalloped hem of
the summer gown. Nothing could be more appro-
priate or more charming. And with all its
daintiness and piquancy, it is the most comfortable
and well-fitting of shoes, as indeed are all those
short-fronted styles, and will suit most women,
giving that ease, lightness and coolness which the
Australian climate requires.

When the British General ordered the advance,
All the British tommies roused from their trance,
Rushed over their trenches with a terrible shout
And quickly put the Huns to rout.
With “Hips” and “Hurrahs” they rushed boldly .-on.
But when they got there the Germans had gone.
Their bayonets were dripping with blood and with
gore,
Yet they battled ahead seeking for more
Huns to kill. The Anzacs were there,
And each man individually did his share.
And meanwhile the British fought their way,
And the Germans decided not to stay
Any longer in their line.
So they set out for the Rhine.
Hurrah for the French and Tommies too
Because we know each man is true.
The madman’s eyes were red and round
As he entered the room with a stealthy bound,
And soon a rusty knife he found - *
Which slit the drunkard's throat right round.
The murderer then without a shiver
Knifed the dying man in the liver,
Which issued forth arid began to quiver
Amidst the gore, which formed a river.
He then stood bade with mild surprise
And gazed at the sight with terrorflerl eyes,
Then shouted with bloodcurdling cries
As the body writhed, “He dies! He dies!’’

J. I carry the message q£ Avon Tyres, and I urge
Avon claims because mileage is the first and last and
greatest thing motorists look for in tyres.
“Why? Because long life is only possible to tyres that are
built of the right stuff and built right. Rubber that cuts and
punctures easily causes endless trouble, and must obviously come
to a speedy end ; fabric walls that are inherently weak lead to
dangerous bursts and premature disruption.
“Fit Avon tyres proven time and again in actual service to
be capable of greatest average mileage—and you find that they
necessarily fill all other needs in the fullest measure. The very
length of Avon Service demonstrates their cut-resisting tough-
ness, sinewy wall-strength and luxurious resilience. The fact
that vou get Avon Service at lowest cost per mile is the clmelis'-<
argument,”

“Nerves”
Our nerves are similar to
an intricate network of tele-
graph Wires. Controlled and
nourished by a portion of the
brain—known as the nerve
centres —the delicate thread-
like nerves radiate in all
directions throughout the
body So long as the nerve
centres are capable of con-
tinually supplying nourish-
ment to the nerves, the
nerves will remain strong
and healthy. But directly
the nerve centres become
weakened by overwork,
worry or anxiety, they are
unable to transmit the neces-
sary nourishment, and the
nerves become worn out and
"on edge." Then it is that
a sudden sound- makes you
“ )ump " —you get irritable—
you suffer from neuralgia—
you are restless and de-
pressed. In this condition
there is nothing to equal
m
Because, being a powerful
nerve food, ' Wincarnis ' gets
right to the root of the trouble,

new nerve force, stimulates

IN
BANANA LAND
A conscription meeting was held in His
Majesty’s Theatre, Brisbane, a few days
ago. Soldiers from the various camps Imd
resolved to attend, but of a sudden were
officially informed that they must on no
account be present at any meeting called to
advocate Universal Compulsory Service. And
the Brisbane Telegraph of the same date
printed a sudden wire from Melbourne warn-
ing soldiers in uniform against attending
public or political meetings. There is a lot of
enthusiasm for Conscription in certain high
places.
The question of public health will have to
be taken right away from ineffective State
control. Dr. Harvey Johnston, the biologist
at Queensland ’Varsity, told the Royal
Society a day or two ago that the Educa-
tion and local Health Departments weiie
criminally neglectful in allowing the hook-
worm pest to run riot among children in the
northern coastal districts. From Nambour
to Cairns the curse is unchecked, he says,
and sleepy departments either wonder wh'y
the youngsters are so anaemic, or blame the
climate for it, and declaim the North is no
place for white people.
After over a year’s fighting in the Bris-
bane courts the parties in the Goondiwindi
libel case are given a clean slate to start the
battle again. The Supreme Court gave a
judgment which the Full Court upset; then
the High Court arrived and supported the
order for a new trial. The whole hubbub
revolves around the question whether there
were 500 clumps of prickly-pear on a lease
which the Land Court was handling, and the
costs to date would buy a dozen better blocks.
Passed out a few days ago, Henry James
Oxley, who had a crowded 50 years in
Brisbane mercantile affairs since his arrival
from London in ’66. For 14 years he was
secretary of the local office of the Mutual
Life Association, and afterwards was con-
nected with various building societies.
Meanwhile he took an active part in Con-
gregational church matters and married
a daughter of the late Rev. Edward Griffith,
once Queensland's best-known “Indepen-
dent” parson. That made Oxley a brother-
in-law of Australia’s great Chief Justice.
Died recently in North Queensland,
Richard Unsworth, who had covered most
of the State with a theodolite. He was in
early at the Cloncurry, Chillagoe, Croydon
and Forsayth rushes. As a youngster he
threw up a billet in the Lands Department
in order to go exploring in the Far North
with the late Ernest Favenc, but was turned
down at. the last moment on the score of
youth.
“Politicus”: Walkers Ltd., of Mary-
borough, declare that with about one-third as
many employees as there are at Ipswich they
can average one engine every few days, while
Ipswich turns out only one engine per month.
Of course, the State shops have odd jobs to
do, but a return showing the actual cost of a
Sosh locomotive would provide evidence as
to whether Labor Governments should
establish any further State
the Trades Hall definitely sets out to exter-
minate the “slow down” microbe.
The six o’clock early closing of N. S. Wales
pubs has boomed the Bung industry in at
least one Queensland town. When Tweed
Heads shuts its pub doors shortly after sun-
set, Coolangatta, on the Queensland side,
attracts the thirst of the N.S.W. township
across the border. And while Tweed Heads
laughs at laws, locksmiths and State bound-
aries, Cold Tea in Bananaland whirls its
intoxicated brolly at State Ministers for
“delaying the successful prosecution of the
war.”
Jack Hamilton, ex-M.L.A. and crack revol-
ber shot, insisted on being put into khaki,
notwithstanding that he was a hundred years
or so over the regular fighting age. He now
instructs the young idea how to shoot, work-
ing at a miniature rifle range at Enoggera.
A mob of cattle was sold in Brisbane
recently after an adventurous trip. They
came from Lake Puri station, in the extreme
south-west corner of the State. The Ryan
Government having closed the Adelaide mar-
ket to Bananaland stock, the mob was moved
east to Thargomindah. Drought conditions
prevented the cattle going to Cunnamulla for
trucking, so the drover took them north via
Adavale, and travelled down the Central
lines to Brisbane markets. It all makes a
fine commentary on State Rights.
The Queensland Trustees, Ltd., was con-
gratulating itself the other day; and F. T.
Brentnall, M.L.C., a very prominent director,
saw his chance. “Why,” he said in effect, “I
didn’t come in until, had I been-in Govern-
ment employ, I would have been thrown out
as unfit for further service.” Of course
Brentnall was referring particularly to the
P.M.’s who have lately been turned adrift.
Minister Fihelly replied that the Act which
his Government had put into operation was
passed not by a Labor but by a Liberal
Administration. But he did not explain how
it is that no Government ever carries out the
retiring provisions impartially. Political or
personal favoritism exempts one officer, then
another; and finally the Act becomes almost
a dead letter, to be presently revived and
exercised with the utter absence of
impartiality.

“De Oriel”: How many Chows are there

A recent meeting of the Cremation Society
recalls that some years ago Parliament put
through a Cremation Act, but no one has ever
yet been reduced to ashes under its provi-
sions. Why doesn’t some member of the
society die and get cremated b_y way of set-
ting an illustrious example? It is all (pre-
cept and no practice with these people.
S. Aus. is the only State which has done
anythihg practical in the matter. It’s get-
ting almost a common thing in Adelaide to
keep the ashes of your dead parent in an
egg-cup.
South Brisbane was at one time the
most German-haunted city in Queensland.
To-day it would be hard to find a single
Deutscher there. But the number of Danes,
Norsemen and particularly Swiss who speak
English with a thick Westphalian accent is
astounding.
“Wal’s” helping of history: —
The narrative of Tom Ingham, one of the survivors
of the Maria tragedy of 1872, presented to the His-
torical Society of Brisbane recently, brings forward
the connection that bluff John Moresby, admiral of
the royal navy and explorer of New Guinea s coasts
line, had with the illfated venture. The Maria was
a leaky, ill-found brig of 167 tons, in which 75
young men, attracted by the rumor of gold in plenty
to be found littering the beaches of New Guinea,
packed themselves with not enough provisions and a
master and mate who were other things besides in-
competent. After various adventures they decided
to make for the Queensland coast, and passing
through the Barrier Reef, more by good luck than
good navigation, they tried to work up the coast at
night, with the result that the crazy old tub piled
up on Bramble Reef on the morning of February 26,
1872. The master then showed the yellow streak by
deserting with the best boat and six of the crew, but
met a just fate at the hands of the blacks at Tam o’
Slianter Point. Three of the men were also
massacred. The others made their escape into the
scrub, and finally, after dreadful hardships, reached
the safety of Cardwell, where they told their story to
Sheridan, the magistrate. One of Moresby’s midship-
men, Sabben, went out with a whaleboat and recov-
ered the Maria’s boat, which did duty for many years
afterwards as the native police gig under Inspectors
Johnstone and Armit. While on the search, Sabben
was attacked by the blacks, and had to shoot several
before he could get away. Moresby then arrived
at Cardwell in H.M.S. Basilisk and assisted in the
search for-the survivors of the Maria. The Peri, a
“blackbirder’’ recently captured by the Basilisk, was
used for the purpose, three officers and 12 men from
the Basilisk, under Lieutenant Francis lHayter, being
sent to search the coast. They surprised the blacks
and dealt out vengeance with a free hand, the native
troopers with them doing things in the time-honored
way. The Basilisk, also, joined in the search and
succeeded in. finding eight more survivors -near
Cooper’s Point, where they had been kindly treated
by the blacks. ( These men related How:they had con-
structed rafts and got away from the wreck just
before she slipped into deep water, arid managed to
make .the land 15 miles away. The mate, after the
master bolted, got as many of the men as possible
into the three remaining boats and went away, leav-
ing nine men on the yards of the vessel to perish.
Those on the rafts had an awful experience, being
nearly four days without food or water before they
reached the land. Three of them went mad and
drowned, themselves, and two fell overboard. Among
the eight survivors was a man named Forster (son of
an ex-N.S.W. Premier), who with one Coyle kept up
the spirits of the miserable party. While on this
search Moresby discovered Mourilyan harbor (named
after Lieutenant Mourilyan, of the Basilisk) and
baptised the river that falls into the harbor Moresby,
in -honor of his father. Captain Armit, .who afterwards
used the Maria’s boat on police duty on the Herbert
River and the Queensland coast, in 1883 led the first
exploring expedition into New Guinea from Port
Moresby, which the Admiral had discovered during
his survey of the coast a decade before.

QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 5, 1916.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
Our Ex. and his little wife, who have
been south with the Stricklands, return
on Thursday night to prepare for the visit
of the Fergusons. The vice-regal cottage is
too small to hold more than one visitor at a
time, so Lady Helen goes to Government
House, and the G.-G. and two aides will find
a shake-down at the Queensland Club.
On Monday afternoon Lady Goold Adams
opened a sale of work in connection with the
Allies’ Babies’ Clothing Society, which is the
Babies’ Kit Society under a new name.
The stalls were well arranged, and the
saleable articles were rushed with the
enthusiasm of the bargain-hunter.
Miss Mary Watkins, once headmistress of
the Rockhampton Grammar School, who has
been running a delightful Book Club here
for the last three years, is closing down
because of the great difficulty of getting new
books.
Carrie Lanceley, the Sydney soprano, was
the songstress at the Apollo Club concert on
Wednesday night. Mrs. W. Harris, whose
husband was the bashful lover in a duet
with Miss Lanceley, is entertaining a party
in the lady’s honor to-night.
Miss Rennie, a visitor from Victoria, is
arranging a Queen’s carnival in aid of the
Residential Club for Soldiers. The lady is
the guest of Mrs. Harry Mills, and local
society is buttering the scone lavishly in
her honor.
Last Tuesday night the pi'esswoinen of
Brisbane gave a medley evening in the drab
old Centennial Hall in aid of the Residential
Club. Bridge and euchre tables kept most
of those present quiet. The Empire manage-
ment lent Edwards and Parkes, who gave a
bright little turn; arid Lena Hammond’s con-
tralto was among, the interesting noises that
were heard. About £BO will go to the funds
as a result of the shivoo.
A boxing tournament and a concert in aid
of the Imperial Service Club attracted a big
crowd to-night. The Club is popular and
useful, and is always sure of a helping hand
when it asks for one.
Mr. and Mrs. Percy Hart gave a cheery
little danec to-night—mostly for the benefit
of Khaki. Pretty girls were, of course, an
accessory.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

Conroy the last of Cobb and Co.’s coach-
men. Up north we have a line old man
named Barnes, father of W.H. and G.P.,
the member for Warwick, lie drove on the
Ballarat run. Coming over to the Lachlan
he drove to Forbes when bushranging was
at its height. He identified O’Malley when
he was shot, has been fired at several times
and wounded once or twice. He brought
the first Cobb and Co. turn-out to Queens-
land. It was composed of 26 coaches in all,
and he personally opened the line to
Ipswich, driving 20-odd horses, he being
strapped to the box. I fancy he was a
shareholder in the co.


STUDEBAKER Preferred
The city that knows how cars are BUlLT—and the State that knows how cars PERFORM-both make Studebaker
their preference. In California the figures are surprising. See the list. Picture whatsuch supremacy means. Then think
—can any man who is buying a car ignore such decisive judgment in his choice ? See the cars that California prefers !

MOTOR CARS.
In Detroit, the town
where about half the motor-
cars in the world are manu-
factured, they show their
appreciation of the Stude-
baker. What Detroiters
don’t know about cars isn’t
worth knowing, and they
are using more Studebakers
than any other make over
£lOO.
In Australia, usually a
man’s knowledge of motor-
cars dates from the he
buys his own car and learns
to drive it, but not so in
Detroit.
Where a large proportion
of the population is directly
or indirectly connected with
the production of motor-
cars, their knowledge is
exact and specific, and is
acquired naturally, as the
inhabitants of our own pas-
toral district acquire their
knowledge of stock.
These are the registra-
tions for cars over £lOO in
Detroit for 1915 :
Ist, Studebaker 1445 cars.

In tHe Land of
Cars and Sunshine.
California, the land of wonderful roads, beautiful scenery and
glorious weather, is the only one of the United States where you
may drive a car without difficulty all the year round.
The Californians are always a-wheel. In their constantly-used cars any
defects soon show up. Theirs is the searching test that finds out weak spots, and
the car that finds favor with the Californians is bound to be one that has earned
its place by hard performance. ■lt is truly a case of the survival of the fittest.
That they prefer the Studebaker in cars over £lOO is demonstrated by the
registrations for the State of California in 1915.
They are as follows:
Ist, Studebaker ..
2nd. ..

less than half as many as Studebaker.

Whether you live in Australia or America this is all useful information.
There is no surer nor more trustworthy opinion than that expressed by the
State of California.
During this year Studebaker is producing 100,000 cars to meet the
increasing demand.

Public Announcement
The Radio Health Institute
begs to intimate to its numerous patients and in-
tending patients that it has moved to larger and
better-equipped quarters at Station House, Rawson
Place, Sydney.
“WE RADIATE HEALTH.”
The Radio Health Institute is under the able
direction of Prof. Adams, M.A., LL.D., D.Sc., grad-
uate of Harvard and Columbia Universities, the
discoverer of th ; marvellous V-ray and Uni-direc-
tional Hertzian wave current., by which use lONIZED
OXYGEN is introduced into the' system, expelling
death-dealing disease germs and literally permeating
the deeper tissues of the body with the vitalising
force of Etheric Electrons This form of treatment
embraces all the recent scientific discoveries emanat-
ing from the celebrated therapeutic institutions at
Paris, Nancy. Brussels, London and New York.
All the results of the researches and discoveries
in the realm of Electro Statics and Ray Science are
faithfully and skilfully utilised at the Radio Health
Institute.
The prefected Static generator employed by Prof
Adams and used solely at the Radio Health Institute
is at once the most costly, modern and the most
effective instrument now in use in any part of the
world. Its marvellous curative powers transcend the
most sanguine expectations of the most far-visioned
optimist.
Prof. Adams is a scientist of exceptional ability,
and after many years of painstaking study has dis-
covered a POSITIVE ozonic ray, the V Rav, whose
potency vastly transcends the emanations of that
rare substance known as radium. The antiseptic
attributes and miracle-working powers of the V-Ray
invest it with peculiar value in the treatment of
open 'wounds. Eczema, Acne and every form of skin
disease speedily vanish under the healing touch of
this curative force. Atrophied muscles are restored,
and sufferers from the graver forms of disease, such
as paralysis, locomotor ataxia and rheumatoid
arthritis, find material benefit or an absolute cure.
At the Radio Health Institute we radiate health.
Pain-stricken, diseased, distressed bodies and worry-
worn minds are introduced to the sunny-souled god-
dess of health. Our patients are courteously treated,
and all receive the personal supervision of Prof.
Adams. As only a limited number of patients can
be treated daily, disappointment may be avoided by
arranging appointments in advance. Hours, from
0.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Address all communications
to Department 8., Radio Health Institute, Station
House, Rawson Place, Sydney.

Rheumatism
SCIATICA, COUT, LUMBAGO, etc.
/
In the majority of cases of Rheumatism,
Gout, Sciatica and similar complaints the
exfl-uciating pain is caused by sharp-pointed
crystals of Uric Acid penetrating the delicate
and highly-sensitive nerves of the body. To
effect a cure this excess of Uric Acid must be
removed, and .no treatment that does not aim
at this result will effect a cure.
Dr. Parker s Great Indian
Rheumatic Remedy
goes to the root of the trouble, and by remov-
ing the cause quickly affords relief and
eventually effects a permanent cure. Read
the following testimonial: —
SEVERE CASE OF RHEUMATISM CURED.

have received from your wonderful medicine.
Hoping that others will co to you for relief
and kindness.—-Your gratefully,

Bigamy seems the only way out in \ ic-
toria. When a deputation from the National
Council of Women asked for more technical
training for girls, it was said that at the end
of 1915 there were 32.000 more women than
men in the State. For every 100 men of
marriageable age there were 132 women, ancl
since then the war has made things worse.
“S.S.”: Bible-teaching is not without its
good effect. A nephew came home from
school (a sectarian institution) the other
day full of valuable information about lepers ;
“Is leprosy curable?” I asaed him. xes,
he replied, “it is frequently cured by
miracles.”
Goolma looks small on the map, but it
ranks with the biggest places in the Empire,
inasmuch as of eligible fighting men it has
given all that it hath. From the beginning
the single youngsters have been moving off,
one by one; finally, the other day, someone
suggested that it was no use making many
bites at a cherry, so a roll-up was called and
all hands enlisted in a bunch. It you find a
single man in Goolma now you know that
lie’s married to a crutch.
From the diary of Edmond de. Goncourt
(“The Journal of the De Goncourts ),
March 23, 1890
This young German Emperor, this neurotic mystic,
this enthusiast for the religious and‘warlike operas
of Wagner, this man who in his dreams wears the
white armor of Parsifal, with his. sleepless nights,
his sickly activity, his feverish brain, seems to be a
monarch who will be very troublesome in the future.
The Commonwealth Archivist has just re-
ceived one of the first legal documents ever
drawn up about matters in Victoria. It
a musty affair, dated Hobart, March -5,
1837, and sets forth in three pages the terms
and conditions on which W. J. Pettett agreed
to become overseer of W. J. T. Clarke s
flocks in the Port Phillip district. Both
parties are still represented in the State ; you
can’t miss the Clarkes.'and it was a relation
of Pettett’s, living up Stawell way, who gave
the relic to the Commonwealth. Clarke got
in early from Van Diemen’s Land, soon after
Batman and Fawkner, and avoided the rush.
“J.F H.” from London :
Dr. W. Moritz Weston, who retired from the R.C.
priesthood to become pastor of a Unitarian .Church
in London, lias now sought re-admission to the fold
of the Pope. He has had a most extraordinary
career. Born in London 48 years ago, he studied in
British and German Universities, taking degrees in
theology and philosophy. After serving for three
years in a German regiment of Hussars he shipped in
a Greenland whaler, went silver-mining in Nevada,
worked his passage to Australia in a tramp steamer,
went gold-prospecting, sub-edited a paper in an Aus-
tralian mining town, worked as a navvy, recrossed
the Pacific, tramped over the Rocky Mountains, acted
as secret-service agent in Siberia, returned to London
and studied law and medicine, resumed theology, and
was ordained a Catholic priest.
Living a quiet life on a farm at Banks-
town is a great-granddaughter of one of
Captain Cook’s sailors in the Endeavor. Her
father was one of the earliest farmers at
Penrith, and the daughter holds a large silver

and has on the obverse side an engraving
of mice in a wheat field. The inscription
is “West Cumberland Agricultural Society
to John Randall, for Best Wheat, 1845.”
Owen Smyth, whose idea of a setting for
the Kingston statue in Adelaide w r as so
angrily opposed by the late Chief Justice
Way that it was altered at considerable
cost, has been able to tell the papers that
Drury, the sculptor, pronounced it quite
satisfactory when appealed to after the work
had been done. The Sturt statue —which is,
like the Kingston, of bronze —will therefore
have just what was planned for the other:
base and steps of red granite from Murray
Bridge, and pedestal of veined marble from
Angaston—all S. Australian stone.
Three unusual law cases heard lately in
Adelaide:—•
(1) Decided by the Supreme Court that a debtor
making a “composition” under the Insolvency Act, but
only paying one agreed instalment, cannot be sued
for the other. The British Act says he can, the S.
Australian Act says nothing, and two Judges to one
held the omissionto be final.
(2) A man of 71 was fined for “trespass.” He had
gone to a factory and wandered about asking ques-
tions ; and the Court accepted the view-that he was
angling for information to be used in running a rival
business.
(3) Small fine inflicted on a driver in a city street
for “not having clearly indicated by a motion of the
hand that he intended to turn into a side street” —the
first case of the kind in Adelaide.
Just disappeared from Sydney Law
Courts, Alfred Charles Tate, who had deco-
rated them for 40 years. Almost as soon
as he got his breath he was a trumpeter in
the Royal Horse Guards (Blues). When
the Crimean war broke out, he joined a
Hussar regiment; next he "was in the
Indian Mutiny, where he was with the 9th
Lancers, and for a time was attached to
the staff of Sir Colin Campbell, afterwards
Lord Clyde. Leaving the army he arrived
in Sydney in 1869, and again went soldier-
ing. this time in the Artillery. After six
years’ service he obtained his discharge and
was appointed orderly of the Supreme
Court. He goes on long leave prior to
retiring on pension.
“The Old Soldier’s” shot
“Quidam” (B. 6/7/’l6) complains of the difficulty
of sizing-up any of the supposed Great Men con-
cerned in the present slaughter in Europe. It all
depends what he means by a “great man.” If it is
a man of the very highest intellect, probably none
of the leaders will fill the bill. Kitchener certainly
could not. In his full vigor he was a very able
engineer and an excellent mathematician. He was a
good organiser ancl would have made a fine
railway or steamships manager, but he had no flashes
of inspiration such as came to Napoleon. Perhaps
.Toffre, though he is another engineer, comes
nearer to the Napoleonic standard than any of the
rest. Moreover, he is free from the disease which,
after 1809, made Napoleon’s genius so unequal, end-
ing in the collapse of the Russian campaign, and
the sacrifice of the 200,000 French soldiers in
garrison in German fortresses. If those men had
been withdrawn in time Napoleon would have had a
veteran army to c ose the invasion of France in
1814. The conditions now are changed. There is
no place in this trench-war for genius; even a
Napoleon would find victory a slow business—too
slow perhaps to suit his temperament, wherefore he
might have met disaster.

MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it up
is to tempt death by Heart Disease, Nervous
Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and Stomach,
Liver or Kidney Disease.
• TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good. It not only destroys the crav-
ing, the desire, the appetite for tobacco, but
restores to health the entire nervous system,
and aids nature in entirely eliminating from
the system the Nicotine Poison.

Outdoors it’s almost
night. Inside you’re

You’re scheduled for a
six-thirty stop. Run by?
Small chance with Big Ben
on the job.
Right on the dot he
sounds his morning signal.
He brings you to a quick
stop with one steady five
minute ring or he’ll slow
you up gently with ten
half minute tugs on the
bell cord at thirty seconds
apart.
Either way you have
ample time to coal up at
the breakfast table and
start the day on schedule.
Big Ben stands seven
inches tall—sturdy, mass-
ive, graceful. His voice
is mellow deep toned,
cheerful. His bold, clean
cut hands show plainly in
the dim six-thirty light.
Big Ben undergoes a hundred
inspections in the making and six
rigid timing tests before leaving

To suffer with fortitude is
heroic, but to suffer needlessly
is idiotic. While most sufferers
regard pain as due to the
dispensation of Providence,
doctors see in it a certain
neglect —the neglect of simple
rules of health.
OF all rheumatic afflictions acute lumbago is the
most painful. It arises from a gradual accumu-
lation of excess uric acid in the system ; the muscles of
the lower back become impregnated until the muscu-
lar fibres stiffen and every movement causes agony.
The simple habit of taking Kruschen Salts every
morning cleanses the system of excess uric acid, braces
the nerves and gives to the user the daily enjoyment
of natural vigorous health. Get the Kruschen habit.

“Copabella”: Why this sudden outcry
about the name “sardines”? Eight out of 10
buyers of a tin of sardines want a small tin
of small fish, the exact breed of the contents
troubling them very little. Connoisseurs of
sardines ask for “Trefavennes” or “Louis
Levesques,” and get the real thing. No one
but an idiot or a politician would expect
to get genuine sardines for the 2M. or 3d.
asked for Norwegian brisling, and the epi-
cure wouldn't buy them if they were branded
“Heavenly Skyfish.” Again, if “sardines” is
to be restricted to sardines, what about the
cheap Portuguese sardine, which is genuine
enough as to breed, but bony, rank and soak-
ing in rancid engine-oil? Will this atrocity
be allowed the familiar trade-name while
high-grade brisling is marketed as something
inferior? The trouble with this tinkering is
that 90 times out of a hundred it is done by
officials who have no real knowledge, but
have merely, during the previous few days or
weeks, been primed with lopsided informa-
tion by partisans.
“Ojo” (from S. America) : Went to an
A. and P. show in M.L. recently, and was
struck by the casual way in which animals
were judged. Judges are apparently under
no obligation to give reasons for their deci-
sions. Each judge may, and generally does,
have a different, idea of the ideal type of the
class of animal lie is dealing with. What,
for instance, should be the points of a 12st.
hack? A. and P. societies should have annual
conferences, and the ideal type should be
decided on. At the shows, the judges should
have printed cards, exhibiting the maximum
number of marks for each point of an animal
and the actual number gained by each
exhibit. The judges should fill in these
cards and sign them, and the figures should
be prominently posted for exhibitors to see
and, if necessary, throw dead cats at.
“D.F.”: It’s easy to get yourself
photoed as a soldier in Melbourne. A
Swanston-street “studio” shows a notice
stating that uniforms are supplied free to
soldiers in plain clothes who want to be
taken in their proper rig. How the camera
can tell whether a man in mufti is really a
soldier, the notice doesn’t say. Perhaps it
doesn’t care.

Some of these bush local-governing bodies
didn’t come down in the last fresh. At Te
Kuiti (M.L.) a brown brother of tonnage
pegged out recently and left £lOOO for the
tangi, or wake. Henare came from near
and far, and the smell of dried shark arose
to high heaven. On the second night of the
jamboree the borough council suddenly cut
off the electric light and the water supply.
Next morning Henare was waiting at the
office door with £2OO, the amount of rates
owing by the pa.

“Max” : Up to. the arrival of the present
Labor Government the locally-slain rabbit
could not be sold in Queensland, and the
corpse, which masquerades as chicken saute
had to be imported from N. S. Wales or Vic.
Even now that the Queensland bunny him-
self can be bi’ouglit to market, Rabbit Boards
frown, for fear that anybody making a profit
from the deceased may fail to exterminate
him fiercely enough. It calls to mind the
venture in which some smart men once
became interested in Victoria. An area
carrying rabbits was netted ; a plant to tin
bunny was installed ; a representative started
out for Europe to wake up markets in
France and Germany. And of a sudden the
Vermin Destruction Act slouched along, com-
manding poison for all rabbits inside the pre-
serve. The, V.D.A. leaned on that rabbit-
proof fence and just wouldn’t move till the
poison was swallowed.

A man who doesn’t believe in walling-up
good coin originated a new custom the other
day. The foundation-stone of a church was
being laid in a N. S. Wales town, when the
genius (one of the leading actors at the
ceremony) advanced gravely and placed
beneath it —a cheque!

At an exhibition of paintings in Mel-
bourne a while ago a large, Hebraic gentle-
man approached the person in charge, took
him aside mysteriously, and said in a thick
whisper, jerking his thumb towards a large
landscape: “I subbose you vould dake 10
per cend. off for cash?” “Perhaps Mr.
would be agreeable,” said the manager. “I’ll
speak to him about it.” “Come, come,”
continued Isaac, persuasively, “close mit
me, uml dere’s der money.” He counted
IS shillings on to the table. The manager
looked perplexed. “Eighteen shillings?” he
said. “But that painting is marked £100.”
“Vat!—von hundert pounts?” The would-
be patron greedily gathered up his silver.
“Mein Got, I t’ought it vos a kvid!” But
he had wanted 10 per cent. off. It’s an
instinct.
SPRING AND THE DRAPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The winds of Winter coldly blow
■ And Kosciusko wears its snow ;
The coastal stations tell of rain,
And little ships creep back again
With funnels rimed with salt, for, oh !
The gales of Winter madly blow.
The shining footpaths look like glass,
And that man is indeed an ass
Who leaves his overcoat at home;
Furred ladies round the city roam,
And tram-wheels throw two jets of spray.
It’s winter everywhere to-day.
Except in drapers’ windows! There
The muslined dummies sweetly stare
With flaxen wigs upon their polls
Midst yachting shoes and parasols ;
For drapers must, despite our tears,
Speed up the seasons and the years,
To sell his wretched rags on time
He spurns all reason, mocks all rhyme,
And drags on Spring ere Winter blows
A trombone-solo on his nose.
When shy, swec-t Spring is really here
He’ll tow in •Summer by the ear.
Though winds of Winter wildly blow,
The draper opes his “New Spring Show.”

bed from birth on the 'Allenburys' Foods.
Mother and Child.
Baby by 2 months.
on Behalf of Baby
Naturally a Healthy Mother
should feed her own child, and no cause, save inability,
should prevent her doing so. But there are many
mothers who, though willing, cannot wholly or even
partially, nurse their children. Either they have no
milk for them, or it is poor in quality and deficient
in sustenance.
The Question then arises
what food should be given to Baby. Carefully consider
this highly important point. Remember, that the
right food, given at the proper age will lay a sure
foundation for future health and happiness. Ordinary
cow’s milk is totally unsuitable as a food for young
infants; it is acid, contains indigestible curd and is
frequently swarming with dangerous germs, especially
in summer time. Farinaceous Foods must not be given, as
a child under seven months of age cannot digest starch.
A Satisfactory Solution
of the difficult problem of feeding children by hand is
provided by using the ‘Allenburys’ Foods. Prepared
as directed, these pure Foods closely resemble healthy
mother’s milk in composition, nutritive value and
digestibility. They are the outcome of prolonged
scientific investigation, carried out with all the resources
of wide manufacturing facilities and experience.
Decide to use
the ‘Allenburys’ Foods. By so doing the many serious
ailments which folllow the use of unsuitable food will
be avoided, and Baby will be equipped with sound
health and strength.

A Gallant Anzac Praises
Dr. Sheldon s New Discovery
Pi'ivate Jack Molloy, 1097, 0 Company,
19th Battalion, felt it his duty to leave a
permanent billet to enlist in defence of the
Empire early in 1915. He was in the famous
Suvla Bay landing-, and was wounded in an
attack shortly afterwards. After lying some
hours exposed to Turkish machine-gun and
rifle fire, the stretcher-bearers found him and
carried him down to the clearing station,
whence he was shipped from Gallipoli Penin-
sula to Malta. He was three months in
Floriana Hospital, and returned to Australia
on the Kanowna. This gallant Australian
writes
“When I left Aus-
tralia with the 19th
Battalion, sth Brigade,
on June 25, 1915, I
packed in my kit a
bottle of ‘New Dis-
covery,’ because I had
been suffering while in
camp from catarrh of
the throat. I cured
myself completely with
this bottle. I could not
get ‘New Discovery’ in
Egypt, but I had some
sent to me at Malta,
where I was lying
wounded in Floriana
Hospital. I have always
regarded *N e w Di s-
covery’ as my only
friend in the medicine
line. I always keep it
near at hand.
“Yours faithfully,
“J. MOLLOY.”

From Bay to Reef.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OUT from Cradle Bay
Sailed a dainty craft,
While the breeze at play
In her rigging laughed.
Fashioned trim was she —
Sails as white as milk;
Harping tunefully
Rang her ropes of silk.
Lit by joy she tripped
Through her azure realm;
Not a sea she shipped,
Since beside her helm
Captain Youth the Bold
Steered her through the seas,
All his locks of gold
Rippling in the breeze.
Through the Fabled Isles,
Dim and greyly veiled,
Dancing down the miles
Buoyantly she sailed.
Breezes came to sport
In her silken ropes,
As from port to port
Led by lustrous hopes
Evermore she drew —
Merchandise her quest—
Here a dream or two,
There a vision blest.
Then she passed anon
Cliff and golden strand,
Till the morn was gone
And the noon at hand.
Sailing strait and sea,
Sapphire skies above,
Caine she presently
To the Isle t>f Love.
Greeting mqlodies
Met her from the shore,
And upon the quays
Golden wares galore;
Scents out-scenting myrrh,
Lights that paled the sun,
Things of gossamer.
Stuff-of-dreams she won.
Then she put to sea,
Moving slowly thence,
Freighted heavily
With experience.
Golden noon was gone,
Gone her easeful drift;
Storms arose anon,
Clouds with ne’er a rift.
Many winds she met,
Many cruel gales
Voiced with fierce regret,
Shouted through her sails.
Perils ever neared,
, Seas beset her bow ;
Youth no longer steered—
Age was helmsman now.
All her sails were shreds,
All her silken gear
W orn to perished threads.
Trembled slack and sere.
Night and tempest drew
Down upon her course;
Like a ghost she flew
Heeled by fierce Remorse.
Now, no more she reels
’Neath the leaden sky;
Keels, and keels, and keels
Round her, rotting, lie.
Where the night wind moans,
Crooning low its grief,
Seek, and see her bones
Piled on Coffin Reef.

RODERIC QUINN.
The Salvage Sale.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WAS heading for the Savings Bank
with my few coins. They had to be
deposited before the haughty officials
there closed the doors at three, or “No
Funds’’ would be written against me. En
route a sign over the old drill hall caught my
eye:—
FIRE ! FIRE ! ! FIRE !! !
Swindells’ Salvage Sale!
Booming Bedrock Bargains!
I recollected that Swindells’ warehouse
had been devastated by fire, and he was sell-
ing off here. Having great decision of
character, therefore, I without hesitation
swerved from my course and plunged into
the structure where bargains boomed.
It -was hot in those temporary premises. It
was crowded with flustered women. Half a
dozen prams, stood within the door, the
claims of the babies sacrificed to the mothers’
lust for burnt merchandise.
On stepping inside I was immediately
entangled with a red cobra or sea-serpent
marked with irregular streaks of black. On
inspection this reptile turned out to be an
unwinding “bolt” of red sateen. The fires
had licked it, and the hose had watered it
with tears. An early shopper had seized the
end of the “bolt” and, gripping it tight, had
gone round and round the building looking
for someone to tell her its bedrock price, and
as she went, the “bolt” had revolved drunk-
enly in the corner, reluctantly paying out its
hawser of sateen. After winding' in and out
of the fast arriving buyers, getting under
loaded tables, and climbing over the cash-
desk with the cobra still by the head, the
bargain-hunter had fainted from exhaustion,
and the snake had escaped her. It was in
this that I was now enmeshed.
Looking hopelessly at the unreachable
bargains, I and others struggled in its tight
embrace. The red sateen went gaily in and
out of the dun-colored crowd, knitting us
together in an intricate pattern like a new
kind of maypole dance. The more we fought
for release the tighter grew our bonds, till at
last Swindells, jun., came with shears and
snipped us free. Then, trampling the sateen
serpent underfoot, we rushed the bargain-
tables. I gained the penny haberdashery
with a bound, but that woman with the
purple toque who sits opposite me in church
was ahead of me. We are instinctive enemies,
though we rub shoulders and digest the same
sermons weekly. We know each other not,
yet hate each other well. This Pharisee
snatched what I was after—gent.’s tarnished
sleeve-links at one penny per dozen sets. Had
I been a cave woman and obeyed my in-
stincts I would have smitten her on the
purple toque with a club, but discretion was
ever the better part of my valor. So instead,
I stooped, and, ’mid the scuffle of human
hooves round the haberdashery, deftly wound
about the ankles of my enemy a mile or so
of braid which had fallen to the floor. Thus,
having hobbled her where she stood, I
blithely got a start of her to the next “throw-
out.”
Long tables supported by trestles were
stacked with men’s wear. Suits for 7s. lid.
Burburrys, once 555., now ss. Certainly the
fire had eaten away the Burburrys’ shouiders,
but what matter? Further on were rain-
proofs without skirt parts. The two rem-
nants neatly joined together would make a
seasonable garment for father to wear to the
city.
But recollecting my mission to the bank,
and knowing my surplus cash to be infinitesi-
mal, I reluctantly left the Burburrys at ss.
to the affluent, and forged my way through
the myriad of women to those benches run-
ning right round the sides of the building
where shirts, reduced to cinders and ashes,
could be had for threepence. With these I
hoped to protect my men-folk from the com-
ing snap of winter.
I fought in that scrum with fair success,
securing at times as much as three-quarters
of a shirt at once. Among these wrecks I
unearthed a white vest—just the thing for
father to wear to bowls. Intact it was, its
purity unsmirched, not a button missing.
How came it there? But it was not for me
to answer that question. I stowed it under
my arm along with the rest of the loot. After
that my luck turned, the neckband or the
ankle part of a pyjama being my only haul.
Thank Heaven, I am not as some gam-
blers ! I know when to stop. So, wiping
heat and cinders from my face, I struggled
for the pay-desk with my bargains, there to
have them wrapped up.
“The lot one shilling,” I said casually.
Swindells counted them.
“Two tennis shirts, in pieces,” he gabbled,
“one narf tail pieces, two pairs o’ sleeves, and
—why? Wot’s this?” He held up the white
waistcoat.
“It’s a vest,” I said.
“A ves’!” he squealed. “Clean fresh
goods! See the mark! Three and eleven-
pence—and you want it for threepence!
D’you want to make me bankrup’?”
“It was among the threepennies,” I in-
sisted doggedly. But Swindells, his usual
oily urbanity scorched off, refused to
see eye-to-eye with me. The thief actually
snatched the vest from me and pitched it
among the “wet onlys.”
Robbed of my one bargain I thyew the
shirt-tails at him, and, staggering to the four-
foot-liigh bench that encircled the walls,
leaned heavily upon the charred goods there.
Presently I felt something catch my ankles.
Peering down, I discovered beneath the bench
whereon I leaned another world. Women
were crawling about on all-fours, clearing
tracks for themselves, over and through a
mass of burnt underflannels which Swindells
had thrown there to be sold in sixpenny arm-
fuls.
It was they who had interfered with my
ankles, evidently taking even those for
salvage.
It looked nice in the gloaming of that
underworld. I could see it but dimly. It was
walled in by the skirts of bargain-hunters
who were raking over the remnants on the
bench which formed its roof. I joined them,
and soon learned the lay of the country, the
outstanding features of which were the hum-
mocks or mounds of flannel about which the
submerged grovelled.
It appeared, on investigation, that the
heaps of burnt underwear consisted of shirts
and pants whose “middles” had been licked
away by the flames. The garments had then
fallen in halves. Swindells or his assistants
had thrown their heads and tails in opposite
directions, afterwards raked them together
again, churned them all about with sticks,
had added flannels with the fronts burnt
away and pants with the seats missing, then
tossed in a flavoring of charred pyjamas
seasoned with singlets minus sleeves, added
a pinch of braces “to taste,” and mixed well.
And a pretty pot-pourri they had made of
it.
I joined the burrowing, creeping humans
who infested this mixture like rats sliding
about in a sewer. One almost expected to
meet the shade of \ ictor Hugo, in which case
I would have carolled “Fancy meeting you!”
It was exciting sport in the half-light
among the charred and tindery underwear—
almost hidden from sight as we were by the
serried rows of above-world shoppers, kicked
and trodden on at times by their intruding
toes. It was almost as thrilling as hunting
big game to drag from the heap of rubbish
■ half a shirt, and then track its tail down the
maze of salvage to the dead finish. I could
feel my face stiffen into an inscrutable mask,
my eyes narrow, and my speech, when I in-
dulged in any, grow cynical and cutting. I
have not worshipped Sherlock Holmes for
nothing. Like human bloodhounds, having
portion of a garment, we scented the missing
fragment down, following every clue and
making the capture, only to find the quarry
in the hands of some blackened trader who
having started with tne shirt’s tail-piece, was
working backwards along a chain of evidence,
m search of the neck and shoulders.
Placards announced that we could have as
much as we could hold for sixpence. I
quickly collected a decent bundle of divorced
trouser-legs, and hung them, scalp-wise, at
my belt. The “tops” I found later, being put
up at private auction by a syndicate as
patching. W hen the syndicate became
aware of me and my “scalps” they offered me
my weight in gold—that is to say, in charred

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S ‘FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

socks, for them. We came to terms, and I,
swollen out on all sides by my new acquisi-
tion, padded heavily and silently on liite an
elephant.
I was determined to make the entire round
trip of the underworld, for I had just found
a set of buttons, and if intrepid courage
counts for anything 1 was going to have the
nnttonholes.
So I “all-fou red” off. A gentle melancholy
soon developed in me —a not uncommon symp-
tom, I found on inquiry, due no doubt to the
semi-darkness, to the chill from the water-
sodden salvage, and to the vague fear that
one would never get out of that living tomb
alive. Added to this, a tender regret that,
literally wallowing as we were in bargains at
bedrock rates, we should not be able to get
away with more than sixpenn’orth of it. All,
however, were not of fine fibre. Some coarse,
practical creatures, clutching at bargains
which turned to dust and cinders in their
grasp, did the round trip of the underworld
in double-quick time, switchbacking over the
hummocks like large, unwieldy birds amongst
tree-tops. They gathered their rubbish on
the wing. There was one devastating trav-
eller with a stout cord arranged in a slipnot
attached to her waist. In this she strangled
each rag that came her way. In her hands
she carried a dozen celluloid collars with
which she rasped the ears of all gropers she
passed. Someone asserted that a white flag
should save us from this vulture; but slie had
not even a military sense of honor, and in
one of her rounds she caught me by the
throat with a crook-handled umbrella she
had found somewhere nor’-nor’-east, and left
me for dead south of hummock 19.
Another type travelled stealthily, like
stalking cats. One such I met. I had just
rounded a hillock of wet flannels in search of
that set of buttonholes, when my eyes met
the yellow glare of another pair. It was
she, the antagonist whom I had tied up with
braid at the penny haberdasheryand
clutched to her chest was a strip of calico
with buttonholes in it!
I have always sensed the feline in that
woman, and my instinct was correct. Snarl-
ingly we drew apart. She bristled up her
hair, licked her lips and growled
“Gr-r-r-r ” Between us lay a bathing-
suit. She grabbed one leg. I grabbed
the other, and, obeying an impulse, thrust
it rudely in her face. She stuck Jier
claws in it. I braced my back to the hum-
mock and my feet on her bunions, and pulled
for the victory. Then the “neck-to-knee”
gave way. I did a double back somersault
over the mound. I never saw her again. The
breakaway had been so sudden that she dis-
appeared headlong down an abyss of shirting.
When some good Samaritan had peeled
my hat from my head, forced by the impact
over my ears, I regained consciousness. But,
alas, my set of shirt-buttons was lost, and
someone had robbed me of all my socks. But
I still had my bag of small coin, and at that
•I rejoiced. I could feel its leather handles
across my palm among the braces, sleeve
rings, and other rubbish I was carrying home
to father.
By degrees the hilly character of the place
oecame trodden to an uninteresting level, and
in consequence much of its delightful mystery
was lost. Instead of popping on friends
around corners we met frankly in the open
like trampling elephants and compared our
pickings. I saw our Sunday-school superin-
tendent’s wife kneeling and gazing into a
tangle of trousers which suggested a picture
of “Man Dancing” by a Cubist artist. The
kneeling one, after greetings, murmured
something about collecting for “the poor.”
She lied. I have since seen the superintend-
ent in one of Swindells’ “slightly damaged.”
By-and-bye I wearied, and —-fatal sign !
began to doubt the value of my bargains; I
never seemed able to collect the things I
needed —hadn’t the knack of it, somehow.
What use could father find for a little boy’s
nightgown? I asked myself. Yet I hesitated
to throw it overboard. And my precious bag
of coins worried me dreadfully. Suppose I
lost it ? Every few minutes I had to reassure
myself of its safety by feeling on my wrist
for its handles, among the dozen neckties, the
three scorched Derby hats and the smoking-
jacket which I had added to the loot.
After a while I found myself having a
heart-to-heart talk with an utter stranger on
the merits of some other stranger called Alf.
I think that in the half-light my gossip had
mistaken me for Alf’s aunt, or possibly she
thought I was his grandmother. So I sat
still. And it just proves how wasted is all
effort, for, while I sat quiescent and listened,
that good old soul grovelled for and piled
upon me the halves of boys’ flannel shirts. (I
had mentioned when first we met among the
neckbands that I needed flannel.)
So now she went prosing and piling me
with pieces. Said she: “You see, Alf’s a
good lad, only ’e drinks an’ plays two-up.
(Here’s a nice bit o’ flannen now—-make a
nice 1itt1e.....) An’ ’e knocks ’is poor ole
father about. (’Ere’s another flannen, not
much burnt, only the neck gone, an’ the
sleeves an’ one shoulder. See?” She holds
up the charred thing. “An’ ’ere’s a front
breath,” she adds. “If we can only find the
back breath now, an’ the other iorst bits,
you’re right—a good flannen for 2|d. —tha’s
right, can’t get ’em no cheaper than that.)
An’, as I was sayin’, if Alf would have give
up darnce-’alls an’ stop robbin’ ’is brother’s
money-box ’e—(’Ere’s the buttons.).” She
grovelled her length away—five feet —and
had to be drawn back by the heels.
But I suddenly rebelled. I was sick of
her, sick of the smell of fire engine and
smoke, sick of my scheme of building winter
clothing out of embers, sick of her pointless
tale about the Alf I didn’t know and didn’t
want to. So I adroitly turned my whole
accumulation of shirt ends and burnt holes
over her, and, ignoring her hoarse cries for
mercy, crawled rapidly out of the inferno.
As I regained the crowded, chattering upper
world I heard the Town Hall clock booming
three. I limbered up and fled like a battery
of French artillery to take up my position
at the bank counter. Arrived there (the
bank is only round the corner) I unloaded
my loot with a flourish and felt for my
handbag. I found the handles only! The
bag itself was gone. I pictured it reposing
in the sixpenny bundle of some thief of the
under-world at Swindells’ Salvage Sale.
WEERODNA.
Guard Mounting.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE take it very seriously aboard
11.M.A. Transport F 450. The
fact that it cannot be an Officer’s
Guard (i.c., 20 men or more plus an officer)
is a matter for regret to the producers of
the show. Owing to a shortage of officers
we are only able to run to a Sergeant’s
Guard —a less glittering affair. The Guard
starts guarding at 6.15 p.m. The preceding
excitement is terrific. The orderly-officers
concerned hurry away to put on their belts.
For a soldier to be late at guard-mounting,
or for an officer to turn up at it without his
belt —but why conjure up unimaginable
infamies?
While the New Guard is falling in aft,
the Old Guard is preparing to expire at its
headquarters near the fo’c’s’le. A distant
howling indicates that the New Guard is
undergoing inspection by the orderly-cap-
tain before being marched to the stage pro-
per. His roars become louder: “Slow
par mss! Orderr akmss ! Pre-sen-TARMSS.
Number 2 put your cap on straight! Ser-
geant of the Guard, look at his cap! Is
this a music-hall or what? Put it on
straight for him! Slow par mss! Orderr
aemss ! Stannof eess !!” The moment has
arrived. The orderly trumpeter sounds his
dreadful instrument. Fourteen dungaree-
clad figures proceed to the boat-deck where
the Old Guard awaits them.
The ceremony which follows might have
been suitable in the case of a mediaeval keep
menaced by robber bands; on a modern
steamer, plying in safe waters, there is a
touch of the superfluous about it. Both
Guards having sloped, ordered and pre-
sented arms in token of mutual respect, they
are stood “at ease.” The corporal of the
Old Guard approaches the corporal of the
New Guard. The fiction is that the new
corporal does not know the alleged danger
spots—the vessel’s Achilles heels, so to speak
—and requires to have them indicated to
him by his predecessor. In point of fact,
everyone has known the posts for weeks.
While the new corporal is being shown
round, the subaltern of the day “hands over
his duties” to his successor. In Tudor times
they might have consisted of seeing that
Hugh the Bloody did not escape; of keeping
an eye on the western gate, where an attack
was expected during the night; or of having
some recalcitrant tortured at a given hour.
With us there is nothing to pass on but the
job of seeing that the blackboard is in its
place for the evening lecture. Nevertheless
the function is performed with dogged pur-
posefulness, after which all hands get back
to their original positions, and await the
return of the corporals.
There ensues one of the tensest moments
of the guard-mounting act. The excitement
of the officers in charge of it—which means,
with us, practically everybody from the
rank of captain upwards—becomes almost
painful. The aim of each of them is to
display keenness and competency by the
identification of ceremonial errors. At my
first attempt as sergeant I caused the New
Guard to slope, when they should have pre-
sented, arms. Have you ever seen a man
arrive hilariously drunk at a funeral, or flog
his grandmother, or fling a baby in arms
over a cliff? If not you will be unable to
gauge the feeling aroused by my offence. I
did not mind so much the sentence, which
was at once imposed, of having to take
three successive guards, starting on the
following night. What hurt was the
knowledge that I had made of myself a
pariah. Scorn, amazement, detestation —all
these were expressed in the voices and
countenances of the senior officers. A black
episode, indeed, and one that I felt was
going to take a lot of living down.
And now comes the exit of the Old Guard.
The New Guard presents arms at the Old as
it marches off. It is a last tribute to men
who have swung their halberds and battle-
axes well and bravely during the preceding
24 hours, and who are now off, their heads
bloody but unbowed, to get a little rest. The
Old Guard, weary as it is (theoretically),
rises gamely to the situation. “Eyes right!”
comes the order from the Old Guard’s ser-
geant—provided always that he retains suffi-
cient presence of mind to give it —and sim-
ultaneously the thin blue file of dungaree
twists its head in the direction ordered and
marches off to tea. The New Guard has its
tea on deck, and thereafter goes on guarding
nothing whatever till it, too, becomes an Old
Guard and goes out of business.
TROOPER 1024.
Peccavi.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The storm-wraith rolled its thunder to the
sky.
The rocks and seas and things inanimate
Caught its barbaric fury. Far and high,
They throbbed with vivid chords of love and
hate.
In fact, the stage was set to match my
theme —
Quite fitted to the tune of Love’s Young
Dream.
The western glow was dancing in her eyes;
I vowed to love her. faithful to the end.
I saw through ivind-stacked tresses how the
skies
Were painted with the pleasures Love may
lend.
’Twas then with all the fervor youth could
bring, . .
She sweetly cooed: “Do you drink any-
thing?”'
I sensed the tumult of the rushing title;
The bonds of modesty grew strangely
taut....
They snapped....l put away my flimsy
pride.
To no pale threads of arrogance I caught.
Triumphantly I clasped me to her ear —
“My love! My Heart! Yes, anything, my
' dear!”
