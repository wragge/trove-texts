Reference Books
We have no complete bibliography nor an
encyclopaedia that is encyclopaedic, but let
us be grateful for the reference books we
have.
If you want to lind a volume on a certain
subject you have the choice of a group of bib-
liographies whose range is limited, but one
of these may give you what you are search-
ing for. Here is a useful list: “Literature
in New South Wales,” by G. B. Barton,
published in ISOS ; “Bibliography of Austral-
asia,” a catalogue of about 8000 volumes in
the Sydney Public Library, compiled up to
1888; “The Australian Catalogue,” by A.
B. Foxcraft, an index to books still current:;
“Bibliography of Victoria,” compiled by E.
A. Petherick and issued in the Victoiuan
Histomcal Magazine, 1912-14; and “Bib-
liography of South Australia,” by Thomas
Gill. There are two other works that are
handy as guides to Australiana : the “Cata-
logue of the York Gate Geographical and
Colonial Library,” collected by S. William
Silver; and Francis Edwards’s “Catalogue
of Books and Engravings Relating to Aus-
tralia.” In manuscript in the Common-
wealth Parliamentary Library there are
“Bibliography of Australian and New Zea-
land Poetry” and “Bibliography of General
Works Relating to Australia and Poly-
nesia." both compiled by E. A. Petherick,
whose rare collection of Australian books
was purchased for this library. The writer
who lives in Sydney will probably be saved
the trouble of referring to any of these by
consulting the card index of the Mitchell
Library.
From bibliography let us pass to bio-
graphy. We should always be grateful to
Philip Mennell, who, while making a few
bad omissions, went to considerable care in
compiling his “Dictionary of Australian Bio-
graphy,” which deals with the period be-
tween 1855 and 1892. If the name of some
past celebrity is not mentioned there, you
may possibly find it in the biographical sec-
tion of Ilenniker Heaton’s “Dictionary of
Dates,” 1879, or in one of the three editions
of Victorian “Men of the Time,” first issued
in 1877, or “Australian Representative
Men,” 18S7. As Mennell’s volume was be-
coming out. of date, Fred Johns stepped in
with his annual, and reference once more
became easy. As aids to history I Sinay refer
to another group of works. It includes
“Colonial Chronology,” by 11. J. Robin-
son ; “Cyclopaedia of Australia,” by David
Blair; “Geographical Dictionary of Austra-
lian Colonies.” by W. 11. Wells; Bailliere’s
“N. S. Wales Gazetteer” and “Victorian
Gazetteer”; a “Source Book of Australian
History,” by Gwendolin H. Swinburne ; the
“Historical Records of N. S. Wales” and the
“Historical Records of Australia.”
As I have remarked before, we have no
comprehensive encyclopaedia. The nearest
approach is Knibbs’s “Official Year Book of
the Commonwealth,” which is now recog-
nised as a model of its kind. Besides its
statistical data, it supplies a short history
of Australia, a valuable chronological tab;
articles on special subjects and a biblio-
graphy of recent works on Australia. There
is no up-to-date volume on Australian litera-
ture. The “Poets and Prose Writers of N.
S. Wales,” by G. B. Barton, was issued
in 1860 ; and “The Development of Austra-
lian Literature,” ’by Turner and Sutherland,
was published about 24 years ago. The
latter never had much value as a critical
work, but as a connected history, and con-
taining, as it does, biographies of Clarke,
Gordon and Kendall, it is useful. In “Aus-
tralian Writers” (1896) Desmond Byrne
confined himself to an appreciation of the
output of Clarke, Kingsley, Gordon, Boldre-
wood, Mrs. Campbell Praed, Ada Cambridge
and “Tasma” (Madame Couvreur), and
dealt fully with the works of these writers,
his account of the incidents leading up to
the publication of “For the Term of His Natu-
ral Life” being particularly interesting. He
makes only a passing reference to Kendall,
but devoted a chapter to Henry Kingsley,
who is barely mentioned in Turner and
Sutherland’s book. The best short account
of Australian literature is that given by
Arthur Pntchett, Martin in the volume on
Australasia published by Kegan Paul; and
the criticisms on the works of Clarke and
Gordon which Francis Adams wrote in “The
Australians” are distinguished by rare per-
ception. Writers on Australian literature
are rather vague about Harpur. Probably
the most complete reference is in “Poets and
Poetry of the Century,” by A. H. Miles,
in which there is an adequate biographical
sketch by J. Howlett Ross.
From his bibliography of Australasian
poetry E. A. Petherick issued a fragment
called “Biographica Poetica Australasica.”
In his “Golden Treasury of Australian
Verse.” Bertram Stevens gave the biblio-
graphies of the better-known poets to the
date of publication of the anthology. These,
together with the introduction, the short
biographies and notes, give an additional
value to the volume. There is no lack of
anthologies of Australian verse. There were
three compiled by Douglas Sladen ; Stevens
issued four; there are “The Oxford Book
of Australian Verse,” Banjo Paterson’s col-
lection of old bush songs, the “Austral Gar-
den of Verse” and several more. Some day
we must have a census of the bards; poetry
in Australia has ceased to become an accom-
plishment ; it has become a habit. The pre-
ference for verse ak a medium is probably
influenced by the conditions of the market :
taking population into account, the sale of
poetry in Australia is greater than in anv
other country.
A history of the stage is needed for our
reference library. Mr. J. M. Forde, The
Bttixettn’s “Oldest Inhabitant,” has con-
tributed a number of interesting articles on
the subject, but they were never published
in book form ; and a ‘series of theatrical
reminiscences by another Ford remains in
manuscript and is housed in the Mitchell
Library. Brewer’s “Drama and Music in
N. 8. Wales,” which is a condensed account
of the happenings limited to one State, is
the most complete record we have. The
memoir of J. O. Williamson, by A. G.
Stenbens. throws light on an important
period; the articles on the beginnings of
drama and music in Alexander Sutherland’s
“Victoria and its Metropolis” are important;
and Charles H. Bertie’s story of Isaac
Nathan fills a definite gap in the annals of
music.'
Our library of reference books is to have
some important additions. Besides a new
edition of his annual, Fred Johns has pre-
pared a volume on “Australian Explorers
and Celebrities.” A History of Australian
Literature which Bertram Stevens had
almost completed will no doubt be issued in
due course. Our meagre history of the stage
is to be enriched by the reminiscences of Miss
Nellie Stewart. And it is understood that
the complete encyclopa'dia we have been
waiting for is to be published before long.
There is no likelihood of a general biblio-
graphy being available. Mr. Wright, of
the Mitchell Library, -says it would cost
£5OOO to print a catalogue of its Australian
collection alone. There would be no sale
for it, and as works are being added to the
library all the time it would be out of
date in a year. On the other band, the card
index is always up to date.
WILLIAM MOORR.
Another Huxley
The “modern” novelist, following the lead
of Remain Holland, catches bis hero in the
cradle, writes a treatise on his teething,
sends him to school and then, moving to
London, hurls him among the artistic riff-
raff and a host of people who find themselves
incompatible with convention. The magnum
opus of this type of fiction is Compton Mac-
kenzie’s “Sinister Street.” Aldous Huxley,
the brilliantly-endowed descendant of Thomas
Henry Huxley and Matthew Arnold, could
quite easily figure ns the hero of such a book.
He is, in fact, his own hero in a series of
episodic excursions in adolescence —a region
hitherto almost unexplored. Always impec-
cably modern, with a mental acuity
approaching genius, Aldous Huxley, well
schooled in the classics arid deeply versed in
licentious literature, has undertaken to write
a Baedeker to that age characterised by a
cracked voice, hair on the upper lip and
juvenile doubts about God. He is start-
lingly sophisticated, rather maliciously ironic
and desperately keen to shock his uncles and
aunts. Everything seems so easy to him that
he suavely pots the white and bids you “see
what a clever boy am I.”* His undergradu-
ate ideas found expression in the flirtatious
free-verse of “The Burning Wheel” and “The
Defeat of Youth” —poetical pamphlets issued
by the Oxford‘publisher Blackwell. “Limbo,”
his first prose work, is a very superior hook
of short stories, written in a dazzling
“literary” way. The first tale is a fantastic
variation on the Jekyli and Hyde theme,
closely knit and well worked-out. A bright
sample of his satire is to be found in
“Splendor by Numbers,” while the mordant
irony driven into the heart of reality in
“Happily Ever After” marks it th§ master-
piece of the collection.
“Leda” is the requiescat of his departed
youth, with votive verse-offerings to Venus
and a sly wink at Cloacina. The title-poem
is pompously classical in construction: Lem-
pri&re and Gliapman decked out in a sophis-
ticated sensuality: the poet’s plea for a dead-
head permit to Parnassus, And the end
poem, “Soles Oecidere et Redire Possunt,”
is a cunningly contrived elegy on an Ego.
Quite determined never to spread his spin-
naker sail on the sea of popular approval,
Huxley has turned spiritual blasphemies into
vngrom verse. The four Philosopher’s Songs
are slaps in the face of that large band of
genteel grammarians who regard art as an
aesthetic seduction, the Lorelei of passionate
helots and psychic fornicators. And the last
shadow of Victorian reticence goes by the
board when he writes a “Morning Scene”:
Light through the latticed blind
Spans the dim intermediate space
With parallels of luminous dust
To gild a nuptial couch, where Goya’s mind
Conceived those agonising hands, that hair
Scattered, and half a sunlit liosom bare.
And, immediately above them, a red face
Fixed in the imbecile earnestness of lust.
Huxley is the first English disciple of that
exquisite lutanist Laforgue, a Continental
consumptive who died at 27, yet who danced
deliciously on the tight-rope of technique, too
clever to consider the prospect of a fall. The
prose-poems contained in “Leda,” with their
verbal encrustations and fantastic allusions,
not only demonstrate a close affinity with
the rich chromatism of Laforgue’s culture,
but show that Huxley has also fallen slave
to the Satanic breviary of Baudelaire. They
are like the coruscations of a colored moth
fluttering in equivocal twilight.
Huxley’s first full-length novel, “Crome
Yellow,” does not fulfil the expectations of a
year ago. We thought he had finished with
the self-analytical adolescent, the bowed-
down-with-melancholy hero who writes vernal
verse, dabbles delicately in Amour and then
disappears off the face of the earth. But
here we have a country house-party in which
Denis is just such a hero. The story is
loosely put together and inconsequential,
seeming as if Huxley bad written it for the
sole purpose of decorating it with a few
dozen little satires on familiar aids to
advanced thought, just as one erects a
Christmas-tree to hang the colored lan-
terns. bon-bons and candy. Some of it
makes excellent reading, as'for instance when
an advanced young woman skates round the
subject of sexual repression, or the host
entertains his guests with ideas about mediae-
val sanitation. Huxley has felt the force of
the flesh, but the theme would have been
better left to D. 11. Lawrence, whose novels
are trial sex-tints on the texture of Freu-
dian psychology.
Other writers may look into their hearts
and write: Huxley exposes his mind, even
to the • length of showing how
Naked Truth
Creaks on her intellectual legs.
His work is not likely to receive the sanc-
tion of Mr. A. C. Benson, nor would it have
endeared itself to his late relative, the im-
peccable Mrs. Humphry Ward. But it gives
its author a sure place besides .Tames Joyce

The Fallen Tree.
Where the fallen tree
Spans the little stream,
And green mystery,
Golden glow and gleam,
Daylong touches all.
Wood and waterfall,
Bides the home of dream.
He who craves for ease
There shall lie at rest;
Soothingly the trees,
By soft winds caressed,
Shall with luliabys
Touch his weary eyes,
Calm his fevered breast.
By that fallen tree
In that quiet place,
Peace and rest has he,
Leafy charm and grace,
Who, tired out with care,
Dreaming, musing there,
Dwells a little space.

Pot-pourri.
Soft robed within the window-niche
She. stood, her shapely arms at play,
Plucking the sweet rose-petals which
Within a bowl she stowed away;
Then spread her spice with industry,
Making her bowl of pot-pourri.
There, framed before the golden light
That bathed a world of joyous green,
She seemed to my delighted sight
As some pure saint, who might be seen
Pictured by master hands of old
In a stained window chaste and cold.
But my delight was most in this:
The saintly beauty all was mine;
A living warmth to hold and kiss.
The love-thrills stirred my heart like wine;
My soul soared high, exultant, free,
In ether seas of ecstasy.
The years their tedious round have rolled,
With curious change, with evil taint;
The love that warmed my heart is cold,
The saint no longer seems a saint:
I claim it not my fault alone
The shrine, once hers, was overthrown.
Yet lingers in that room to-day
Some soft sweet essence that prevails
To lead a tender thought away
• From mundane care that carks and stales,
Back to the old forsaken dreams;
And as of old she seemed, she seems!
Soft-robed within the window-niche
She stands, her shapely arms at play,
Pinching the sweet rose-petals which
Within a bold she stows awayj
There, framed before the golden light.
Once more a pure saint, dear and bright!
* Ah, sweet scent of forgotten flowers
That so restores the past to me!
From mem’ries of long-vanished hours
May my heart make a pot-pourri
Of gentle" thoughts, whose essence kind
May calm and soothe a troubled mind.

Silverwood.
In Silverwood the golden wattles flame
Down ways Ipng trod by happy childish
feet;
The fleckless skies that dream above them
frame
Deep-fronded slopes, rain-washed and
blossom-sweet, .
And paths where every beauty holds a
thought
Of rapture, like clear music, memory-
wrought.
Ah, sweet o’ wattle, how your magic clings!
A faint, dear fragrance out of childhood
blown,
Like Morning's self and all the sweet she
brings,
Or that enchanted song’s rich wonder-tone
Heard first in this green garden where I
stood
Amid the wattle-fire at Silverwood!
This green bush-garden where I walk again
Green now with tangled grass, and flower.
Where like lit altars to the past remain
Only the wattles in their blossom dress,
Only the rustling grasses and the sigh
Of lifting leaves against the cool J)lue sky!
Life held no challenge here, no bitterness —
Fleet shadows only and broad golder
gleams;
Slim gracile willows drooping tress o’er
tress,
Long, fern-dense gullies, beautiful with
dreams;
Far hills, far cloud-peaks; great, calm, misty
skies,
Where fire-white eve grows purple-dim and
dies.
These only! Ah, not here love woke to
bliss!
In this green place of quiet memory,
More sweet that passion, dearer than a kiss,
The forest-magic laid its spell on me,
Misting with dreams the bush heart’s dappled
gloom
And sunny aisles of morning-scented bloom!
Ah. Life will never learn another way.
Of complaisance so dear, so exquisite!
Grim irony, and pain, and sorrow grey,
Year by slo v year, have shamed and
darkened it.
Yet here at las L youth wins, as from the
mould
Brave wattle-m aories blossom into gold !

FOOLING WITH ANARCHY.
The average Australian who has never
thought of firearms in comnection with his
worst enemy reads with bewilderment of
the happenings in Ireland. He is offered a
wide freedom of choice in, apportioning the
blame: —
“Two hundred and fifty elerl :s in the Royal Irish
Constabulary pensions office in (Dublin announce that
they will go on strike to-morrow. They declare that
their lives are not safe in S( mthern Ireland, and
that they wish to leave with tb.e means to establish
homes elsewhere.’’ —One cable message.
“The carters in Belfast have .struck on the ground
that they do not receive sufficient protection from
attacks.” —Another cable messaf, e.
“The whole of the (Ulster) {irovocation had come
from a Dublin clique.”— Lord i Carson.
“Far fewer persons had lost their lives or been
subjected to persecution in t he 26 counties of
Southern Ireland than in Belfast alone.”— Winston
Churchill.
So the uutravelled Australian cannot know
much of the present rights (or wrongs of this
calamitous row. All he does know from his
own personal experience is that it
is extraordinarily bad business. Australian
unity has cost a deal ro,oro than the dog-
license fee which was mentioned so freely
at the end of last century. Yet who will
say it has not been worth tl'ie money many
times over in national prosperity and pres-
tige? In the material sense the Irish have
more incentives than we* eve;'" had to unite*
and set up within the Empire * on their own
account. For many years the E 'ritish Govern-
ment has not spent half as mi ch on Ireland
in Ireland as it has taken ont of it in taxes.
And for centuries Ireland h as been con-
demned to the status of ai cl liefly-pastoral
country, whereas under a national Govern-
ment it would impose Protects ve duties, as
the Dominions have done, and build up the
many industries it is so well fluted to main-
tain. Australia is aware of i 11 this, anil
that the lion in the path is' an insane reli-
gious row which not only kee, P s Ireland,
despite all its natural wealth and geographi-
cal advantages, near the rear of the national
procession in the economic sense, but also
causes a great deal of crime and bloodshed.
*-*•*■#
The phenomenon is attributed vaguely to
an unfortunate racial trait. But in point
of fact sectarian hatred is a comparatively
recent manifestation in Ireland. The
“Patriot Parliament” which got to work
when the Commercial Restraints were lifted
at the beginning of the 18th century was a
true Dominion assembly. Both Protestants
and R.C.’s were represented in it; and,
though not democratic as we understand the
term to-day, it was far more so than the
then House of One of its first
activities was to pass an Act for the Advance
and Improvenfent of Trade and the En-
couragement and Increase of Shipping.
New ships were exempted from one-eighth
of the Customs duties for their first three
voyages. Part of the duties paid on the
importation of goods from the American
plantations was remitted on re-exportation
in the. made-up state, and so commerce as
well as manufacture was encouraged. The
woollen industry began to rival that of the
mainland. During all this time R.C.’s and
Protestants worked together, for the good
of their country, in harmony as complete
as that which exists amongst ourselves.
They were separated and eventually set at
each other’s throats by politicians. Roman
Catholics were excluded from the Irish Par-
liament by an English statute, and in face
of protests from Ireland, in which many
Protestants joined. It was the prelude to
the destruction, amongst other things, of
the Protestant woollen industry. When the
Protestants concerned objected they were
reminded from London that some of them
had been granted Irish estates by the Crown,
and that the remainder “depended for their
very existence on England’s arm.” Still,
the Presbyterians of the North clamored
for self-government; so much so that as
the 18th century drew to a close and the
Act of Union approached, Ulster Protestants
were being persecuted as bitterly as South- *
ern Catholics, and were in consequence emi-
grating as freely to America. Although the
sectarian wedge hod been in operation for
many years before the Union, Lord Shef-
field, in speaking to the resolution in favor
of the change ( Union Tracts , Vol. 6), had
occasion to say :
The objection to the Union on the part of the
Protestants of Ireland is unaccountable. .. .They are
an English colony in the midst of three millions
of Roman Catholics, or at least six times their own
number ; and such is their situation that their couse-
quence and security depend on their connection with
the Mother Country.
In this atmosphere the ascendancy idea was
born, and the breach which the party poli-
ticians of Britain had always wanted began
swiftly to widen. The whole subsequent his-
tory of the country, up to the recent Confer-
ence which was responsible for the Irish
Free State Agreement Bill, has been based
on a policy of. keeping Irishmen divided,
on sectarian lines, for ’ party purposes. It
has not mattered to the rank and file of
Irishmen for over a century now that the
most eminent leaders of the allegedly R.C.
section have been Protestants such as
Wolfe Tone, Fitzgerald, Emmet and
Parnell ; or that the most strenuous Castle,
men have been English Catholic dukes
and marquises. The convention is estab-
lished that Catholics and Protestants have
conflicting interests, and never the twain
may meet unless in combat.
* * * *
The attempt to create this division in
Australia has been, made many times in the
past by clerics of the narrower type and by
politicians who realised that their chances
of getting office on legitimate lines were
dwindling. However, in the same way as the
politician of the 1-Sth century somehow failed
to see what a weapon a sharply-divided
Ireland offered them, so our politicians and
others have made only half-hearted efforts to
exploit sectarianism here. The conditions
are those of Ireland reversed. Instead of a
Catholic majority of 80 per cent, there is a
Protestant one of about that size, and the
ascendancy party is alleged to be R.C.
instead of L.O.L. Plainly there are oppor-
tunities here for the creation of unlimited
strife and hatred. At the last N. S. Wales
election a definite beginning was made in
the exploitation of this issue on the grand
scale. Catholic candidates offered themselves
on a denominational ticket, though Archbishop
Mannix has himself admitted that there
is no religious issue here. Protestant candi-
dates appealed for support on a number of
inflammatory statements which appeared as
advertisements in the daily papers. As
might have been expected, on the relative
denominational figures, the Protestants were
more successful than their rivals. In some
cases where they worked the L.O.L. ticket
thoroughly they were so successful as to
suggest that, for one who aims only at
getting into Parliament and staying there,
it were foolish to advocate any other policy.
That is the selfish and unpatriotic view—the
view of the politically and otherwise poweT-
ful London traders who were willing to see
Ireland wronged provided they were
enriched. The traders’ view was also a
short-sighted one. A peaceful Ireland would
have brought the mainland more business
than it took from it any time in the past
two centuries; and latterly- the cost of
sectarianism both in reputation and in cash
has been ruinous to England. It would be
easy to separate Australians into two camps
—or, anyhow, enough of them to produce
such effects as are in evidence in Ireland
to-day—on the lines which successive
political leaders have employed on the other
side of the world. But disaster would surely
follow. As in Belfast, long after every
sensible citizen had realised the folly of
disunion, that curse would be raging briskly
in the form of faction fights and propaganda
designed to widen the area of conflict. It is
an issue on which the public should give the
politicians a lead before it is too late.
LABOR IN JAPAN.
During recent years every session of the
Japanese Diet has brought forth its financial
scandals, and this session’s crop seems likely
to be quite as spectacular as those of former
days, if not more so. Most sensational is
the* allegation that large sums obtained by
officials in Dairen through opium deals were
used, not only to enrich these gentlemen
themselves, but to spread corruption through-
out the Government, the chief figure in the
affair, Mr. Nakano, head of the civil admin-
istration at Dairen, being credited by the
Asahi with the confession that he wished
to “shape about 10 members of the Diet
after his own heart.” According to the
Toyko press, he obtained 304,380 yen through
his opium deals, the details having been
obtained from his statement subsequent to
his arrest. The excuse is made that the
Dairen administrator, seeing that certain
Japanese were making huge sums in the
opium trade, thought it a shame that this
wealth should go into private pockets.
Accordingly, he obtained a Government mon-
opoly on the Dairen opium trade, in the
name of a group of Diet members, whose
names Mr. Nakano will not disclose, saying
naively that this would ruin their reputa-
tions. Large sums were used for obscure
political purposes. For instance, 30,000 yen
went into the general election fund, and
30,000 yen was advanced to agents of the
South China Government to enable it to
subsidise certain brigands about Harbin and
Kirin, and another 50,000 yen was advanced
to Chinese political ruffians. The matter
will be taken up by the House of Peers, and
a searching investigation is predicted, which
may prove very troublesome to the Govern-
ment.
Troubles do not come singly, however, and
a few days ago other charges were made
against the Kawasaki Dockyards Co., the
largest shipbuilding concern in Japan, to the
effect that it had used falsified documents
and inspection seals in connection with the
vessels which it has been building for the
navy. Reputable Japanese papers give mul-
titudinous details, the Asahi even publish-
ing pictures of what purport to be the false
seals, of which it is claimed there were about
30 in existence. It is contended that by
using the seals the co. was able to place
in the ships material far inferior to that
which had passed the Government inspec-
tors, and that it profited hugely thereby.
The chief of gendarmes of Kobe, where the
yards are located, is known to have exam-
ined several of the company officials and to
have searched their houses, confiscating vari-
ous documents. The officials of the concern
deny the charges flatly, saying that they are
the result of malice on the part of dis-
gruntled workmen who have been discharged.
Strength is lent to their claim through the
fact that representatives of Lloyd’s declare
that forgery of the seals, such as has been
described, is impossible, while it seems true
enough that those who claim to have the
evidence are, in fact, former workmen of
the company. The leaders of the Japan
League of Labor are backing the charges,
and have called meetings of workmen to
press the case, which will, without much
doubt, soon also find its way into the Diet. A
son of Marquis Matsukata, the Elder
Statesman, is president of the concern. The
Ono Dockyards Co., of Osaka, is also sub-
ject to similar charges. The works are now
closed, as the men are on strike; and the
accusations are part of the strike campaign.
Whether these charges prove true or not,
they are at least an evidence of the inten-
sifying hatred of the industrial workers of
the large cities against their employers. The
unrest, which has been growing for years,
especially since the depression in business
set in, has been augmented by the feeling
that armaments reduction will cause further
unemployment. A few days ago a group
of workmen of the Kure naval arsenal sent
a threatening letter to Admiral Moriyama,
chief of that institution, stating that they
would sacrifice their lives if necessary to
seek revenge on him, as he had “betrayed
the workmen in spite .of his promise not to
discharge them even if the Washington Con-
ference should limit naval construction.”
The temper of the workmen is also shown
by the fact that at a meeting held by the
employees of the four Asaka factories of
the Sumitomo Co., one of Japan’s giant cor-
porations, the men elected ag members of
their shop committee Lenin, Trotsky and
Heigo Asahi, who recently assassinated
Yasuda, “the Rockefeller of Japan.” Even
the more temperate of the workers are de-
manding relief from the Government, insist-
ing that, if they are discharged from
Government factories as a result of
armaments reduction, they must be
given ample discharge allowances, such
as are generally given by private con-
cerns in Japan in such cases. The work-
men demand two years’ wages in the event
of being thus discharged. The demand is
less absurd here than it w*ould be considered
elsewhere, as the employers, fearful of labor
riots, often give discharge pay amounting
to a year’s wages or even more. General
Tanaka, Vice-Minister of War, is reported
to have promised the workmen protection,
though to what degree is not known. A
number of labor organisations are sending
representatives to Tokyo, where they are
trying to have the Diet pass legislation
which will ensure workmen against unem-
ployment. On the whole the sentiment of
the nation is with the laborers, but the fact
remains that Japan will be able to hold
her own in the great international trade
competition only if she reduces the cost of
her goods; and wholesale payment of work-
men without return in production cannot
but cause increase of production costs, which
is the very thing the country must avoid.
HENRY W. KINNEY.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Rumored Passing of Lenin.
Report has it that Lenin approaches
the cJose of his stormy career through
cancer, the same trouble that carried
off Napoleon I. and Napoleon 111. and
many smaller adventurers —a bad enough
end, yet probably a better one than
leprosy, which was the trouble with Robert
Bruce, or being bitten in the stomach by
an ape, as the recent King of Greece was.
Lenin, a nobleman under an alias, is aged
52; Trotsky, who is the other half of the
Russian Revolution, is a plebeian Jew aged
45. These two, being then 47 and 49 respec-
tively, elected themselves, and then consis-
tently re-elected themselves —at least, no one
ever heard of their term expiring or of an
appeal to the country. No adequate succes-
sors are in view, because it isn’t safe for
the self-appointed despot to allow adequate
successors to grow up—they may want to
adequately succeed too soon. Though they
were professional conspirators of many years’
standing, the two had no luck in the way
of upsetting the Imperial tyranny, but they
upset Kerensky’s new and still-unsteady
Republic while Kerensky was at the Front
fighting the battle of civilisation. When their
“white-ant” process had wrecked the army
it was found that peace had to be bought by
the surrender of everything that the Hun
demanded, and his demands were not small.
If the “capitalistic” Allies had not dragged
the plunder from him the Hun’s Empire would
have become, thanks to the Two, Lenin and
Trotsky, the great tyranny of the world
and of all time. Being saved from that,
Soviet Russia became a job-control country,
where the employees were told to annex the
factories and run them as they saw best, and
show how the thing ought to be done. The
almost total stoppage of output made the
Government fly to the other extreme, and
Russia became a land where labor was com-
pulsory. But as the labor was controlled
by men chosen because they were good Bol-
sheviks instead of good experts, the results
were small. The Government took entire
control of ‘‘production, distribution and
exchange.” But as its exchange became
valueless paper money, production grew
tired. Slave labor proved itself slow labor.
The confiscation of all portable wealth, in-
cluding the banks and the public debt, only
demonstrated that wealth which doesn’t cir-
culate, because no one has confidence, enough
in the owner to do business with him, is. a
golden corpse with a madman sitting on its
head. The nationalisation of land also fell
flat, because the small farmers, who were
too numerous to be effectively coerced,
stolidly failed to know that they were
nationalised, just as they failed to see the
benefit of growing surplus grain, to swap
for valueless paper. Their stupidity was
one more rock against which the theories
of the Two split. The. new Russia was to
be a peace country: it had disbanded its
army, and told it to find its way home on
foot and on its own resources, and live by
eating wolves on the road. But soon Russia
became the armed nation par excellence,
with compulsory universal military training
that begins at the age of 18. It is the
world’s only country professing to enjoy
Parliamentary government in which the sol-
die]*. usually a disfranchised person, is an
Estate of tlie Realm by himself. The Legis-
lature, such as it is, consists of “Work-
men’s, soldiers' 1 and peasants’ deputies.”
Among others, the financier was banned —
the financier who might have saved the coun-
trv from the pit of bankruptcy, which is
deep, and the pit of famine, which is deeper
still. So the soldier —the “six-bob-a-day-
murderer,” as the Bolsheviks of Queensland
loved to call him —forming a Parliamentary
institution by himself, became the outstand-
ing feature of the new Russia. .The. late
John Storey, before he realised his failure,
used to say: “It is easy to govern a country
if a man is honest.” In the depths of his
primitive soul it appeared to “Honest John”
that if one was a perfectly sincere Seventh
Day Adventist and could worm his way into
Parliament, he was qualified to manage
revenue, banks, railways, ships, land prob-
lems, taxation problems and a thousand, other
intricacies. Lenin of disordered Russia has
a reputation for this kind of honesty; and
what greater failure a less honest man could
have produced it is hard to imagine. But
perhaps Trotsky will show us.

country about social survey, and in 192 U it
started to make an inquiry on a hitherto
unheard-of scale into national income and
what becomes of it. The “bureau” was
directed by the ablest representatives of
every conceivable interest, and the actual
research work was entrusted to a group of
men who admittedly were purely scientific
and non-partisan. Their investigations
covered the 10 years 1909-18. The national
income in 1918 (104 million people) was
found to be 61 billion dollars, equal to 58(5
dollars per head, as against 319 dollars ]
head in 1909; but on the basis of 1913 prices
the per capita income in 1909 was 333 dol-
lars and in 1918 it was 372 dollars. (The
highest point reached was 400 dollars in
1916.) But the most interesting section of
the inquiry was concerned with the division
of the net earnings of “mines, factories and
railways,” whose operations could be fol-
lowed —the producers, roughly speaking, of
one-third of the national income, and gener-
ally the most highly organised commercial
enterprises in the country. At their
highest “wages and salaries” took 77 p.c. of
the net earnings, leaving 23 p.c. for “manage-
ment and property.” At their lowest wages
and salaries accounted for 67 per cent,
of the total. “Management and prop-
erty” includes rentals, royalties, interest
and dividends. And of “wages
salaries,” salaries alone consume “not
more than 5 or 6 per cent.” of the
net earnings. At no time in the 10 years
did “wages and salaries” take’less than two-
thirds of the net value or earnings; its pro-
portion was more often three-fourths. The
other one-fourth to one-third had not only to
nay rent and interest, but also to provide for
losses, and not losses only of interest, but of
capital as well. In the case, say, of mines
it is certain that more than two-thirds of
the profit in any 10-year period is lost in
ventures .which produce no profit at all; in
some 10-vear periods the losses of capital
far exceed the total profits. Indeed, only a
very small proportion of the total amount of
the net earnings available for “management
and property” is consumed by the proprietors
in any industry. By far the greater amount
is made available for extensions of operations
—either the same or some other operations.
Some of the men who attended Hughes’s
“economic” conference the other day pro-
fessed to be amazed at the profits made by
the Broken Hill Prop. Instead of being
amazed, J. S. Garden, who.had most to say
on this matter, ought to remember his old
pulpit days and thank God that he lives in a
country which now and again can yield such
results. The profitableness of the Broken
Hill Prop, induced thousands of people to
put up money for the opening up of hundreds
of other mines; few of them ever returned
their owners anything, but all of them pio-


vided work. It led on to tlie establishment
of smelters and refineries ; to the opening of
the Iron Knob flux quarries; to the construc-
tion of coke works at Bellambi; to a demand
for additional millions of tons of coal; to the
iron and steel works at Newcastle; to the
establishment of some scores of subsidiary
iron and steel industries. No unsuccessful
enterprise - ever led on to such an extension
of industry offering good wages for tens of
thousands of men. A. C. Willis, the spokes-
man of the coal-miners, proposed last week
that, in order to allow unsuccessful coal-
mines to pay high wages and sell cheap coal,
the successful ones should subsidise them.
As a matter of fact, successful coal-mines,
like successful industrial ventures of every
other kind, subsidise industry already, and
subsidise it in a way far more beneficial to
labor; for they encourage people to open
other mines and develop other industries,
and most of their own profits go in the same
direction.

The Sort of Chance that Foch Seized.
After many and varied experiences the
prayer of every coherent citizen of Australia
ought to be: '“Let our rulers, if they have
some side-line of industry, be men who
manufacture things, build things, grow
things, even buy and sell and finance things
—men, in short, who do things. Let them
not be of the union-secretary type, which is
a city product with no wide outlook on Aus-
tralia, and a mean-street product, with its
frowsy office in Goulburn-street or Lygon-
street, or some such place. It is its busi-
ness to keep books of account that have no
more to do with the productive, active affairs
of life than the ledgers of a monastery; to
take a wholly one-sided view of a thousand
small disputes ; and to have it corroded into
its mind that the producer is the common,
incurable, unpardonable enemy.” The union-
secretary sort of person is in a class by
himself, like the police-court solicitor. He
has no future except in politics, for he can’t
even start on his own account in a small
way, as the carpenter or blacksmith can.
Therefore, he regards politics as an end,
not a means. He is an adept at getting in
and keeping in, because lie has been ballot-
ing about this trifle and that all his life,
and has seen all the “slim” devices of the
game. His Stock-in-trade has, of necessity,
to consist largely of wrongs, real or other-
wise, to be righted or brooded over, and sus-
picions to be magnified. The idea of treat-
ing this semi-detective, semi-clerical person,
who is neither trained employer nor produc-
tive employee, as one with special qualifica-
tions for politics in a land where the Gov-
ernment is a universal provider-of-all-trades,
is grotesque. The disaster of Nationalism
(or whatever it might call itself) lay in
taking in adroit specimens of this class as
a supposedly necessary concession in war-
time. Hughes is a surviving example. He
has the city habit, the narrow outlook that
is acquired fcv looking from the Trades Hall
windows at the houses opposite; the. unpro-
ductive, unbusinesslike, unfinancial mind, for
a union office is no workshop, and collecting
levies isn’t finance; the casualness about
strict legality that comes of active dodging
in strike-time; and the cat-like but useless
smartness that is born of Trades Hall in-
trigue and tile development of balloting as a
fine art. So far as N. S. Wales is concerned,
any new and sane Government that comes m
will have a chance to move back to the com-
parative sanity of 10 or 12 years ago, and
to add much-needed improvements thereto.
If it is possible to get the kind of Cabinet
that loves big jobs for the credit they bring
it, the new combination should rise up and
call itself blessed above allots predecessors.
It will have, the chance which fell to Foch,
who came in when all seemed about lost,
and made fame by repairing the blunders and
rebuilding the ruins of his predecessors. It
was a simple case of “No ruins, no Foch.’
Also no fame. Coming after a combine
which talked more, bragged more, squabbled
more. Spent more, and did less apart from
vulgar fish-faggery than any other of its
age, new men in the Government of N. S.
Wales can look great and virtuous by doing
things that would have been nothing won-
derful a few years agm Bad as
things are financially, there is so much of
the new Dooley extravagance, and of the
Holman extravagance before it, which
aches to be cut off, that the making of a
handsome surplus out of the present taxa-
tion should really be easy. No one is likely to
press seriously for reduced burdens for a
good while. Even if the income-tax on com-
panies be 2s. Gd. in the f, while elsewhere
it is 6d., relief from the fear that it might
presently be 7s. 6d. would be. a boon to go
on with’. It isn’t every Ministry that can
buy popularity with a half-crown income-tax.
Nine months ago there were 24 railways m
the Ma State which it would pay, in a
strictly cash sense, to abandon or sell. at any
price, inasmuch as they paid neither interest
nor expenses. The list is longer now. The
interest bill has doubled in 11 years: the
sinking fund has left off; and the prelimi-
nary census returns hint at a most lament-
able depopulation of the country towns. A
new Government which understood the uses
of judicious panic would, on the strength
of these matters, proclaim that an Unparal-
leled Crisis had arisen—as it lhas. . A
combine with that love of conquering
obstacles which makes big men hunt Poles
and Himalayas wouldn’t part with an Un-
paralleled Crisis like that for its weight in
gold.

Cactus Doesn’t Secede.
The average Coalitionist has his scheme
of N.S.W. “decentralisation,” of course.
He suggests a few more connections
with Brisbane and Melbourne so that
the far north and far south of the
State may use these as alternative
ports. But of the fact that the State
has unused ports of its own, where cities
would grow if railways connected them with
their hinterland, he seems to be as unaware
as any nude savage in the middle of Africa.
The policy which every stodgy politician
practises, even though the courage to preach
it may be lacking, is to keep so much popu-
lation in the one-sixth or so of N. S. Wales
which geographically attaches to Sydney, or,
rather, to so depopulate the rest, that the
one-sixth can outvote all this rest on the
question of Separation. What good this does
the old stodgers no one could really tell; but
the most petrified British aristocrat who
ever held that the House of Lords is essen-
tial to civilisation, if not to salvation, never
stuck to his faith more doggedly than do
these others to their craze that something
dreadful must befall if the big State is
broken up for closer settlement. Yet the
keeping of the north and south of N. S.
Wales so far empty that they may not out-
vote the metropolitan section is a crime
against Australia —against its people, its
happiness, its hopes, and especially its hopes
of remaining a white and free community;
against everything it has or is likely to have
that is worth having. Nor is that crime
mitigated by the grudging admission that
it is a legitimate thinsr to give the north
of the Ma State better connection with Bris-
bane, and the south better means of dealing
with Melbourne. For this show of liberality
can’t lead to Queensland or Victoria sepa-
rating, since they are separated already.
Nothing will serve but the development of
the State’s own harbors, such as Coff’s,
Port Stephens, Jervis Bay and Twofold
Bay, in the same simple, efficient way that
Sydney was developed—by railway connec-
tions with the handy interior and by local
control of port affairs. Eden, on Twofold
Bay, is an older town than Melbourne and
blessed with a better harbor than the
Yarra; but being unable to serve its back
country it isn’t Melbourne —only a hamlet.
The long Australian coastline is dotted with
similar tragedies. Australia is committing
suicide to keep its big States locked up
against closer settlement. Small politicians,
in their craving to rule over large spaces,
prefer cactus to inhabitants. Cactus doesn’t
secede.
Wives and Mothers.
Louise Dixon’s final comments:—
“Gae” (B. 2/8/’22) asserts that only a woman’s
maternal instinct induces her to marry. Which
means that, it she were previously assured of her
inability to bear children, she would not marry.
The most suitable comment is “Rubbish 1” It is
quite true that one has only to look around to
observe the contrast between the expression of the
married and single girls, but it is not that a man
sets out to “break the heart and spirits of the jolly
girl he has married,” as “Gae” thinks. It is
only in problem plays or the feminist novels of the
George Sands 'school, which brought the “misun-
derstood” female into vogue, that this sort of thing
happens. A man has usually a better sense of fair
play than'a woman, but what can he do with one
who does not know what she wants except that it
is something she hasn’t got? Since childhood she
has been soaked in the sort of romanticism which in
literature ends always on the same note: “So she
married the Prince and lived happily ever after.”
When she finds that the keys of Heaven are not
automatically acquired with a license to love on
the premises, and that marriage only complicated
existence for both parties, she has not sufficient
philosophy or enough outside interests to keep her
from sinking into one of those disillusioned-looking
women one meets everywhere.
“Thorold Waters,” whom I take to be a man,
objects to women getting on “intellectual stilts” or
referring to the “welfare of the race.” If women
were more concerned with the welfare of the race
they would not be so ready to accept for the father
of their children anything capable of buying a
wedding-ring, and the moral and physical degenerates
would not find it the easy matter to reproduce their
kind they do at present.
“Hattie Knight” seems to think ■ the monotony
and drudgery of woman’s daily round are the causes
of most of the trouble. But I don’t see why it
should be so. Stirring pots and wiping babies’ noses
may not - be the most exhilarating pastimes, but they
are no more depressing for the spirits or stagnating
for the mind than most other occupations. Besides,
wives with few responsibilities and infinite leisure
are. no happier.
My remark that women arc over.-sexed has called
forth some emphatic denials, and the sporting girl
is pointed to as an example. I cannot- see that
her alleged readiness to mix in a comradely fashion
with the opposite sex is any indication of a-platonic
turn of mind. It merely gives her opportunities
t-o get the “inside running” from her more stay-
at-home sister. Surfing is no doubt a healthy, recrea-
tion. But it is curious to notice that the flat-
chested, bow-legged sisterhood object to mixed bath-
ing from “conscientious motives.” Certainly there
is no distinction between the sporting and non-sport-
ing when it comes to asking the librarian, in a
confidential aside, to reserve for them such books
as “The Sheik” or “Simon Called Peter,” which the
sex is rushing at present. Nor does it affect the
repertoire of risque yarns which the merest flapper
can disclose with the least encouragement —yarns
that are calculated to make a revolving corpse of her
grandmother. Last, but not least, take the fashions
in clothes. Even the least observant can hardly
fail to notice that our streets , and public places are
filled with women who are apparently trying to see
how much they can leave off without being arrested.
If some perverted sort of sex-impulse is not respon-
sible ’for this I’d like someone to tell me what is.
My first article was not a reflection on the
education of Australian girls. What -I most de-
plored was the bad advertisement the majority of
wives and mothers are for matrimony. For years I have
been impressed with the taken-in-and-done-for
expression and the vague atmosphere of, discontent
which surrounds so many married women (it sur-
rounds some married men, too—it’s catching) ;
and I have tried to delve to the root of the trouble
with *such results as I have endeavored to outline.
And my conclusion is that even the brightest women,
once they settle down to the real business of life and
depend for companionship almost entirely on their
own sex, are apt to become engulfed in,the general
slough and lose sight of anything of value that they
earlier possessed. I for one refuse to admit that
baby-rearing is such a soul-destroying thing, but
it’s a fact that anyone who ventures into maternity
oftener than once, or twice at most, is regarded by
her fellow-women as an object of either compassion
or derision. A woman’s proper place in the scheme
of things must always be the same until science can
find new ways for perpetuating life. The mind 1
want to see more of is not the type which can de-
velop the highest capacity for passing exams., but
the sort which can see things as they are'and make
the best of them, knowing that, as life is largely
made up of compensations, it is important to realise
just what they are and how to value them.

Too Much Politics.
Australia suffers from the same disease as
Ireland. It is too much consumed with
the political fever. Into every household in
some Australian States the eternal topic, out-
side domestic matters, is politics —who’s in
and who’s out; how these scallywags got
into office and what chance there is of
whipping them out; and so on ad infinitum.
This state of things has been brought about
to some extent by the fact that nearly every
family has some member who is an employee
of the State —Jack is in the Railways ; Tom
is in the Police; Mary is a typiste in the
State Insurance Department. Consequently
the gyrations of party assume an overwhelm-
ing importance, for a change may imply
retrenchment and sack, or a stoppage
of promotions, and Heaven knows what else.
Further, every class has dropped into the
vicious habit of running to the Government
to beg a balm for its troubles. The unem-
ployed in some States practically sleep on
the Treasurer’s doorstep. No sophisticated
local authority will undertake any public
work without trying to tap the Govern-
ment ; the dairyman wants a State pool to
keep up the price of his butter; the wheat
grower must have a guarantee for his crop;
the sugar-grower looks to the Government to
see that sugar does not fall below Gd. a lb.
Everywhere people in town and country alike
run to the politicians for help in place of re-
sorting to the simple and obvious remedy of
co-operation. The custom is essentially a
vicious one,. and ultimately rebounds on the
heads of those who practise it. In Queens-
land dairymen have repeatedly asked for
State interference when worried by busi-
ness troubles, and the State some few years
ago in return compelled dairymen _to sell
their butter in drought time at considerably
less than the cost of production by way of
justifying State meddling in the Cow Indus-
try. ‘in N. S. Wales it was the same with
milk. Cocky complained, and no wonder;
but he himself was to blame for hurrying
off to the Minister to get things done by a
Department that should have been done by a
Dairymen’s Association. The prime disease
of Australian life is that everybody runs
to the Government for aid ; that every Gov-
ernment runs to' the money-lender for aid;
that the individual citizen has thrown over
industry and self-reliance for State sops.
Such a reliance on politics and politicians is
a gigantic evil. It saps manhood, kills enter-
prise, breeds on the one hand a sapless race
whose only ambition and outlook is a stool
in the Treasury, a job of ticket-snatching on
the Railways or a snug little billet in the
P’lice, and on the other a tribe of politicians
whose only real qualification is that they
can get hold of bribe-money and use it to
the best—which is to say, the worst —effect.
Dying Out.
Another instalment of the census reveals
the fact that the isolated and Bolshevik-
ridden Northern Territory had only 2459
white inhabitants left on census day (1836
males and 623 females). This was a loss of
2090 in the two years during which the in-
dustry-wreckers have held possession. In
other' words, the neglected property is going
back to the beginning of things. And the
bray of the ass is again loud in the land
saying that “the North” is no place for white
men, and still less for white women —as if
a new climate had set in since 1919. Pre-
mier Barwell, of Adelaide, is the one not-
able person who follows this theory to its
conclusion by demanding niggers for the
North; Others, more fatuous, go on the pro-
position that “the North” must be kept
white, and at the same time is a place where
whites can’t exist. In that way they dodge
the question of building the essential rail-
road. It is the simple creed of the Parlia-
mentary jobber that a province which hasn’t
even one vote in either House to keep Jobber
in office needs no railway or anything else.
The line would bring population—at least,
every party hack is prepared to swear that
railways, where there are votes to be bought,
will promote settlement on a million farms,
open up the country and make the great
natural resources swell up more than a
poisoned dog—and then the Territory would
have votes to give away, and then there
would be a breathless rush to give it more
railways. But the result would hardly
arrive in time to benefit the present Jobber,
so his policy is to treat the Territory as an
unfathomable conundrum, to be solved only
by prayer and fasting, while he reaches out
for the'railway money for his own electorate.
As a matter of fact, the Territory has a
greater area of cool-weather country, or at
least non-tropical country, than either
Victoria or Tasmania, though both of these
are suspected of being habitable. Its winter
temperature goes down in places to 14deg.
below freezing-point. It isn’t Australia s
real North at all. That distinction belongs
to Queensland, which is still regarded as
quite fit for white settlement. But Queens-
land’s North always had votes to sell, so it
got railways, and they brought people. In
fact, the census showed quite a remarkable
growth in Maryborough, Rockhampton,
Townsville and Cairns —all places that lie
abreast of the Territory. If loss of white
population is proof of unfitness for white
settlement, the list of places where “the white
man can’t live” is long and surprising. In
N. S. Wales alone it includes Orange, Lis-
more, West Maitland, Tamworth, Dubbo,
Grafton, Inverell, Armidale, Casino, Forbes,
Glen Innes, Wellington, Cudgegong, Murwill-
umbah, Gunnedali, Ballina, Cowra, Narrabri,
Penrith, Young, Moree, Barraba, Cooma,
Coonamble, Condobolin, Blayney, South
Grafton, Gulgong, Muswellbrook, Narromine,
Temora, Tenterfield, Molong and Kuring-gai.
All these municipalities have been convicted
of losing inhabitants during the 18 disas-
trous months of Dooleyism up to last New
Year’s Day. During the period when
the Northern Territory went 1308 people to
the bad, the single shire of Bulli lost 2299
and Namoi 2134. The Australian is now
thi world’s super-eminent grubber in c ; ties,
and as he fell in love with machine politics
he fell out of love with exploration and
adventure. Instead of going out in quest
of new provinces, new ports and new possible
cities he potters about the condemned tene-
ments in William-street, Sydney, in search
of votes to help Bloggs on his Parliamentary
or municipal career. He runs town-planning
associations with never a new town to plan.
The last time he devised a new town was
about 30 years ago. The last time he devised
a new port was about 60 years ago, or'the
British Government did it for him in the
“colonial” days. The last time he devised
a new State was—never. The Territory
came under consideration when the spirit of
adventure was dead or in eclipse. Stodge,
not heat, killed it.
The Pirouetting of Party Leaders.
Premier Lee, after causing an outburst of
indignation among the Speck’s public ser-
vants by accepting an order from the Leg.
Council to reduce salaries throughout the
service, now announces that careful inquiry
discloses that the decrease in prices is too
infinitesimal to warrant any such reduction
at all. Thus, Parliament being out ot
session, and “the Lords” effectively gagged,
Lee can start for the general elections free
of the threatened handicap of civil service
hostility. After the elections, of course, if
the Government gets back to office, the
Council may ask for explanations and
demand wholesale retrenchment of public
servants. But Lee’s troubles then ! He will
simply regulate his policy by circumstances,
and, unless his Nationalist majority is
weakened by the election of several Country
party incorruptibles, he will probably find
it easy to again bluff the Council on the
retrenchment or any similar issue; If the
Upper House persists in declining to take
seriously any threat he may make to resign
and hand the reins to the Labor party,
meanwhile making his Ministerial life a bed
of briars, then, unless his courage fails, he
will play the biggest trump in the National-
ist hand —the promulgation of a “common-
sense” retrenchment programme, with the
abolition of the Council as the first objective.
It goes almost without saying that such a
programme, which is strictly in accord with
the traditional policy of the party that has
already floated serenely for six years on
planks souvenired from the Labor platform,
would secure popular support, and probably
give the Government a further term of office.
If there are still benighted folks who regard
Nationalist abolition of the Leg. Council as
a thing unthinkable, they are directed to the
fact that a State referendum on the liquor
question is already part of the Nationalist
platform; and if a liquor referendum, why
not a “Lords” Abolition referendum? It
would seem that, in the present state of
public opinion, or absence of public opinion,
on matters of public morality, there is
nothing to prevent any sufficiently agile set
of politicians from remaining in power until
the cows come home. They have only to
refrain from internecine strife, and the Gov-
ernment may remain a thriving parasite,
provided always, of. course, that the parasite
retains sufficient discretion to shift its posi-
tion when trouble threatens, like a flea on
a dog’s back at scratching time.
The People’s Eyes.
By The Bulletin’s M.D.:—
The frequent appearances of John Joseph Watson
in one or other of the N.S.W. law courts on the
charge of posing as a doctor of optometry of as an
eye specialist, are getting tiresome ; yet there doesn’t
seem to be an effective method of dealing with such
cases, owing to the loose wording of the State’s Medi-
cal Practitioners’ Act. No sooner is “Dr.” Watson
convicted in a country court than he appeals to the
Full Court, and though on his last appearance one of
the Judges said he was sailing close to the wind,
the verdict was upset, and the eye specialist pre-
sumably was at liberty to resume his profitable call-
ing in the country districts. In the view of the law
the title he used at Gilgandra—“Dr. Watson, Eye
Specialist, from Sydney”—might be interpreted as
meaning a doctor of philosophy, or even of divinity,
and a fine could not be inflicted unless he was stupid
enough to place the letters “M.D.” after his name.
It is a sad commentary on the protection which the
Medical Practitioners’ Act affords the public, inas-
much as in qualified ranks doctors rarely put their
qualifications after their names.
The decision of the Court opens up a large field
for the exploitation of the public through interfer-
ence with an organ that is the most delicate in the
human body; and the danger involved in the hand-
ling of it ought to be made clear to the politicians
whose own ineffective work is responsible for the
present unsatisfactory state of the law.
Unequalled eye practitioners rely almost exclu-
sively upon one drug, and that drug happens to be
among the most dangerous in the B.P. —atro-
pine sulphate. It is a very hazardous remedy even
in the hands of the general practitioner, and number-
less tragedies have resulted from its improper use.
Colonel Elliot, formerly of Madras and now of Lon-
don, probably the world’s greatest authority on
glaucoma, is never tired of pointing out its dangers.
He wrote in his textbook on “Glaucoma” (page
119) : “A still graver abuse is the haphazard instil-
lation of atropine by some general practitioners in
all doubtful cases of eye disease.” It is a rule
(frequently broken, I’m afraid) never to use this
drug without testing the tension of the eye, and
examining the optic disc with the ophthalmoscope.
The unqualified specialist cheerfully accepts all risks
knowing that he will be far away if things turn out
wrong ; I have been told of the unlicensed fraternity
promising to cure even cataract without operation,
by means of drops. In such a case the patient is
buoyed up by faith when, after a couple of instilla-
tions, he finds that there is an improvement in his
vision. This result can be explained easily enough,
but there is no lasting benefit. The cataractous
lens is more opaque in the centre, and the widely
dilated pupil:—an effect of the atropine—allows rays
of light to pass through the clearer peripheral parts,
to the betterment of vision. But by experimenting
in this way with a dangerous drug the quack is
liable to set up the dreaded glaucoma in a catarac-
tous eye, thereby ruining any chance of a successful
operation. Its use, also, is liable to set up glaucoma
in elderly people with a refractive error who have a
predisposition to this disease. Its use by unqualified
persons should be absolutely prohibited by law.
Oculists usually fight tooth and nail against the
proposition when there is a mention of the registra-
tion of opticians; but registration would at any
rate go far to prevent the country, being scoured by
potentially dangerous people. With a Board con-
sisting of opticians and a sprinkling of oeulists, all
qualifications would be scanned rigorously, and in
time, no doubt, the peripatetic “specialist” would
disappear.
The Prohibition “Lesson” of the U.S.A.
From Fred C. Middleton, secretary of the
Business Man’s Efficiency League:—
Prohibition is coming. Whether it will be five
•or ten years before it arrives is a mere incident.
The big fact to face is that it is on the way. Even
brewers and publicans admit this. That being so.
isn’t it wise that some educational work should be
done to instruct the public mind generally, and busi-
ness men particularly, as to the effect of dry laws
where they are in operation? We have sometluTisr
to learn from America in this connection, and if we
are wise we will seek to avoid the pitfalls into

which she fell, both in the preparation of the actual
law and its subsequent enforcement.
“The U.S. has not abolished drink,” you say.
That is so; but, according' to your own figures, they
are only distilling one-third of what they did pre-
viously. And this not as a beverage, but for the
four permitted purposes—medicinal, sacramental,
commercial and industrial. Some of this undoubtedly
gets used as a beverage, for we will admit that the
Eighteenth Amendment isn’t prohibiting drinking
altogether. But it is prohibiting a great amount
of drinking—say, 75 per cent. And that’s a good
percentage, whether you are shooting the übiquitous
bunny in Australia or enforcing a dry law in
America.
Let me answer your query as to whether “this
inequitable state of affairs [i.e., the evasion of the
law by the rich and its enforcement against the
poor] can last even in dollar-bossed United States.”
Insofar as this is the result of anomalies in the law
and of graft and inefficiency among law-enforcement
officers, it will not last long, according to latest
information. But prohibition will last. It has
lasted 70 years in the State of Maine, 40 years in
Kansas, and 30 years in North Dakota, and, accord-
ing to President Harding, it has now come to stay
as ail integral part of the national life.
We have taken Uncle Sam’s lead in a lot of
things. We might do worse than follow him in this.
At least we ought to have open minds on the ques-
tion and be prepared to face all the facts.
Upon which The Bulletin remarks:—
This paper has nothing against the Sydney Busi-
ness Man’s Efficiency League except that, like the
allegedly investigatory bodies which are pursuing
the same ends,, it appears to be ashamed of its right
name and its trade. The camouflage they adopt
suggests that they are not open-minded students but
partisan propagandists.
Undoubtedly educational work is of value on the
prohibition question, and it is a good thing “to
instruct the public mind generally and business men
particularly as to the effect of dry laws where they
are,; in operation.” Australians do not need to go
t,V America to see dry laws in operation and in the
act of being disregarded by those with money. The
phenomenon has been in evidence in M.L. for about
quarter of a century. But if it is argued that
America affords a better test The Bulletin is will-
ing to take the State of Maine above quoted. In
ISB3 when serious prohibition was first introduced
there the population was 648,936;-in 1890 it was
661,086; and in 1900, 694,466 —an increase in 20
years of 7 per cent. ! Maine (with an area of 33,040
square miles, great timber and mineral wealth, and
the largest undivided area of good arable land in
New England) has only 782,191 inhabitants to-day.
Maryland (12,327 square miles) has 1,384,539.
Maine’s revenue is $9,000,000 ; Maryland s
$15,000,000. California, the wettest State in the
Union after New York, went from 1,213,398 inhabi-
tants in 1890 to 3,119,412 in 1918. So that as
regards material prosperity Maine is no shining
advertisement of the policy which the Business
Man’s Efficiency League wants to saddle on Aus-
tralia. But it may be contended that prohibition
has never had a fair chance there; and on that point
t(je “Encyclopedia Britannica” may be quoted by
the abolitionist as follows: “The Maine (Prohibi-
tion) law’ labors under the disadvantage of all laws
not vigorously sustained by public sentiment, and
is grossly violated. For the most part it is executed
to the degree demanded by local sentiment in the
several municipalities, thus operating in practice
much the same as a ‘local option’ law.” The
U.S.A. is not “prohibiting a great amount of drink-
ing, say, 75 per cent.” The Bulletin figures re-
ferred to Spirits legally distilled. To them must
be added the enormous quantity of vile liquor which
is being illicitly distilled and the large quantity of
good and bad which is certainly smuggled over the
borders. “It is obvious to any resident of New
York,” wrote the S. M. Herald’s American corres-
pondent a few Saturdays ago, “that fortunes are
being made in illicit trading, In fact, that is a
standing joke, the subject of constant quips.
This paper is no bigoted enemy of prohibition.
It is ready to be convinced, in face of all the evi-
dence afforded by teetotal Turkey as against beer-
drinking England, by dry North Dakota (which,
with its 14 paupers, per 100,000 of the population, is
one of the meanest States of the Union) against
wet New York, that business efficiency and affluence
may follow the water-waggon. But it does not advocate
following Uncle Sam’s lead on the prohibition issue
because, so far, he has not given one. Nor has any
other nation or State in the world. The attitude of
The Bulletin is that it is waiting to see prohibition
begin somewhere.

Three Whiches on a Blasted Heath.
Dear Bulletin—This, by the daily paper
report, was Sydney-candidate Ben Fuller’s
typical slab of wisdom, and I commend it to
your prayerful consideration :
Surelv it must be patent to all intelligent people
that if it was possible to obtain millions of pounds
during the war for destructive purposes, it is ridicu-
lous to now contend that sufficient money is not
available for constructive purposes to permit oi the
progress and advancement of our State, such as the
development of a decentralisation policy by a net-
work of cross-country lines, which would open up
tens of thousands of acres of fertile soil m the
interior of this wealthy State, which has unlimited
natural resources, and which is almost unequalled
in any part of the world.
When State Statistician Smith last pub-
lished his figure-book the area of S.
Wales blessed with local government was
117.458,£54 acres. That left i7.616.22fi
acres unincorporated. This last lot, most
of the non-saleable West, with 23,000 inhabi-
tants, is no asset to borrow on. The unim-
proved value of the incorporated space is
given at £96,792,615. The value with all
improvements i§ set down at £260,554.749.
The peace debt of the State was last given
at about £170.000,000. So it far exceeded
the unimproved value of everything, and was
rapidly overtaking the improved value. The
Australian States have a trick of self-decep-
tion by which they treat the war debt as if
it was owed by some wholly foreign Power.
The Ma State’s real liability, with its pro-
portion of the Federal embarrassments
added, as they should be when its Benjamin
Fullers set out to show the margin that
remains for further loanmongering. is in
the neighborhood of £330.000.000. With this
it has bought assets that, on their earning
value, are worth about £100,000,000. and as
it has sold the nublic estate —the children’s
heritage—to about the same value and spent
the proceeds, there is really nothing appre-
ciable left to posterity as a set-off against
the appalling dead weight .of heartless
swindle that is bequeathed to it. Unsold
public land is no set off. it being wanted for
revenue purposes. This is what Australia
of to-day hands down to Australia of to-
morrow :
Item: An estate that has been mortgaged to almost
the last copper of its value.
Item : A pile of badly constructed works that have
to he kept alive out of taxation. It would be cheaper
to abandon many of them.
Item : A pair of hands that are not nearly as use-
ful as they should be, for the teaching of trades has
THE GUEST OF DIS -HONOR.
THE CHAIRMAN: “We have with us this evening ” —
been subordinated to the doing of rough work on
the construction of loan railways to develop “the
boundless natural resources of the country,” till the
Australian has become a parasite living on loans
and is apparently unable to live without them.
Item,: The idea that, being the salt of the earth
and the Chosen Person, he should work less, loaf
more and be paid more than the common, non-aris-
tocratie herd in plebeian lands.
No doubt it is possible to borrow more
money on the security of the pawned and
beggared offspring. The king of finance will
lend to anybody, so long as he is confident
of his ability to neddle out his holdings at
a profit to decayed clergymen, old maids,
widows and other small investors. Confede-
rate bonds, Ticiiborne claimant bonds and
the securities of an imaginary Central
American republic have all had a flutter in
London. It is possible, as any citizen may
see, to borrow more on the children, just as
it is possible to kill the children. The ques-
tion remains: Is it worth while? It is
an easy business to “decentralise” by borrow-
ing millions and building “cross-country rail-
ways” that will end at the same old central-
ised spot, and will add to the long list of
public works that don’t pay for axle-grease,
so that posterity ( may have more loads to
carry and posterity’s father may postpone
facing the situation a little longer. But is
it playing a grown man’s part in this world
of endeavor? —Yours, etc., J. E.

Disregarded Laws.
Although Sydney Town Hall was supposed
to have been “cleaned up” some months ago,
the law remains dead in relation to two of
the most discreditable features of city streets;
The traffic regulations under the Police Act
provide that any person who, by sounding a
musical instrument, causes a crowd to
gather, shall be deemed guilty of an offence
and fined. Yet so-called “Soldiers’ Bands”
operate everywhere unchecked. Some of
them contain no soldiers, though the per-
formers’ costumes convey a suggestion to
the contrary. Some employ a small army
of cripples who importune passers by “in a
manner which recalls the professional mendi-
cants ,of Asia. It was understandable that
ex-Mayor Lambert, who did not pretend to
be concerned about the honor of the. Diggers,
should have turned a blind eye on a spectacle
which exasperates every soldier; but why
a City Council containing such men as
General Rosenthal should refrain from
moving is a mystery. The other prominent
and easily preventable public nuisance is the
street seller of art-union tickets. This prac-
tice, which is neither more nor less than a
game of chance played in a public place
to the annoyance of the citizens, is indulged
in by all sorts of people, from hefty police-
men and firemen to ladies in distressed
circumstances who are allowed a permanent
monopoly of part of a footpath for the pur*
pose. Two-up, which has been called ‘‘the
fairest gamble in the world,” is held by the
authorities to annoy the public even when
played in remote spots half a mile or more
from any road. The odds against scoring
in (say) the Blank-Street Firemen’s Art
Union are usually about 100,000 to one. and
occasionally double as much. Most of these
preposterous “gambles” are associated with
carnivals, in which a final raid is made on
the pockets of the community. It dis-
closed at a recent meeting of the North
Sydney Council that at a carnival held in
St. Leonards Park £2OOO had been raked in.
After the deduction of expenses only £5OO
was available for the object to be benefited.
So that the nuisance, besides being a nuis-
ance. amounts often to the rooking of the
public under the cloak of charity. In order
to get rid of these two reproaches the city
authorities have only to fall back on ordi-
nances which are already in existence. For
the credit of the city as well as the comfort
of its inhabitants the law should be enforced.
“Settled Soldier’s” blue outlook: —
“Ex-Dig” (B. 9/3/’22) suggests a further financial
grant as the only way to keep soldier settlers on the
land. It may be right in some cases, but here is
one who does not want it. In common with most
other Diggers in the grazing line I bought sheep
when they were dear. I got 270 for £4so,»and.
though I have increased these to over 500 in about
15 months, 1 have not had a penny return. In the
last three months I have, however, had two bills
from the Department amounting to over £5O.
\l[hen the wool is sold that debt will about cut the
cheque out, leaving me nothing except the promises
that Billy Hughes made us in ’lB to live on till
the next clip is due; but by that time 1 will owe
the Department £134, so it’s gone, too. If we
were given a further advance the only thing to do
would be to buy sheep, and the way the markets
are fluctuating it’s just as likely to land us further
in the mire as out of it. What we really want is
better terms to repay the £615 we have had. If
interest only was required for four years, and the
balance made payable in 10 equal instalments, with
interest added, we might make a do of it, as during
the four veals we could breed up sufficient sheep to
meet the larger repayments. Unless something of
this kind is done, I and several others round here
will be compelled to throw in the towel within the
next six months. Though I have spent £3OO in cash
(my war gratuity, deferred pay and allotment) and
three of the hardest years of my life, 1 really cannot
ask my wife and children to live on wild pigs and
honey much longer. After four years’ war and three
years of Repatriation 1 say: Give me war.
«
“G.M. J.”: Dr. J. W. Bean’s plea for prison
reform) (B. 23/3/22) has everything to
recommend it except that he doesn’t do
justice to all Australian gaols. The “barbar-
ous business” he talks about may be deserved
description of certain penitentiaries, but it
isn’t fairly applicable to the Westralian
system. I refer now not to the Groperland
method with case-hardened criminals, but
with the first-term men. They at least are
not cooped up in ugliness; they have some
o] portunity of emotional outlet and any
amount of intelligent physical exercise. All
this is the rule under the regime of Super-
intendent Badger, of the Kottnest Island
reformatory. There the penal patient works
healthily out of doors amid beautiful scenery,
s'wims in the sea or bathes in the warm salt
lakes, hunts the wily crayfish to its lair,
hauls the juicy snapper flapping to the beach,
traps wallaby in the wattle and browses in
the healthy prison library. No one bleats
in his impatient ear the immorality of wrong-
doing. He learns the commonsense philo-
sophy that crime it not a paying proposition,
which is about the only argument with any
real punch in it. He learns his lesson
through hard, muscle-grinding work (propor-
tioned according to his physical capacity
for it), interspersed with tastes of the best
that freedom and civilisation offer the .ver-
age man. Thus, with his palate for these
things carefullv tickled, when Badger
returns him his freedom he takes it
with a firm grasp and swears he’ll neve: let
go 6f it again. Only one man in 20 returns
to the island kindergarten for a second
lesson.
■
“Bouraou” : Under Sir William Macgre-
gcr’s ordinances in New Guinea a man
was liable to criminal and civil pro-
cess if he forcibly abducted a colored
female; and for removing the lady
more than 25 miles from her father’s
village, without a license, he was liable to a
fine and to be required to put the damsel
back on the parental doorstep. If he had
paid for his native' wife as local custom de-
manded, no one said him nay, provided he kept
the 25-mile rule, though a resident magis-
trate could intervene if cruelty or worse en-
tered into the case. The missionary, how-
ever, has altered all that, and brought into
being the indissoluble black-white marriages.
A particularly bad- case occurred on the
Mambare. The local R.M. declined the re-
quest of two German diggers on the Gira
to acquire wives on the purchase system
from the Mamba villages, w’hereupon the
pair went off to Samarai, persuaded one of
the L.M.S. missionaries there to marry them
to two notorious Milne Bay prostitutes, and
then returned in triumph with their wives
to their claims on the Gira. One lady
stayed a week before bolting with the cook-
boy. Her departure was announced by a
note from her husband: “Mr. Warden, my
wife has gone bush with the cook. Please
send the police after her.” As the R.M.
was reading the note the damsel and the
cook-boy wmlked in and surrendered. Two
days later the other bride followed suit, but
she brought two male escorts from her hus-
band’s claim. The ladies were, of course,
sent back to their German lords. So were
the cook-boy and the two carriers. The only
sequel I ever heard was that husband No.
1 had been found headless in his hut at the
Old Gira crossing, shot by the cookie. What
became of the widow I never heard, but
cookie I fancy, died of a broken neck. A
varied experience of native races has con-
vinced me that these relations of white and
black an* a fatal mistake from all points of
view T . The permitting of legal marriage be-
tween a civilised human being and a stone-
age savage is an iniquitous crime/the chief
punishment for which should fall on the fool
legislators who make laws allowing it. With
all its faults, the casual relationship had this
to be said of it in the PaPua I knew: it
bred no half-castes. Though such associa-
tions were common enough in those days
I never once saw or heard of any offspring
of the unions.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Pre-selection should find its Woolloomoo-
too (which is less respectable than Water-
loo) -with this N.S.W. election. The Labor
machine permitted the holding of exhaustive
ballots at which expenditure was unlimited,
and rich men had a good time while other
men were occasionally ruined. In fact,
people began to dream of a time when only
a rich man could afford to be a city Labor
candidate. And the preferential vote makes
it all superfluous, save to give the rich man
a “pull.” Of course, when the party wins,
the men who get in can raise their salaries
to make good the loss, while those who stnv
out can be appointed inspectors of chimney-
tops at decent wages. But when the party
fails there is only scandal, impecuniositv
and gloom.
With a suspicion that the jig w T as up the
N.S.W. Cabinet of 13 laid some nice baits
for their probable successors. A loan that
was offering in London was refused and the
deficit at the end of February was rushed
uu to over £5,000,000 —which means euite a
big dead horse for any new tenant to find
decomposing on the premises. The city
railway was re-started —not in such a way
as to call for much prompt cash, but enough
to make big liabilities. The Harbor bridge
was started —on paper, which is inexpensive.
The steel part of it, which isn’t inexpensive,
was left. The long-promised and long post-
poned aid to Sydney Hospital arrived at the
last moment in the shape of, not cash, but
a guarantee—for the next people to pay.
Short of burning down the Government
buildings on leaving it would be difficult to
do more. If a new crowd dates back the
reduction of Minisb'r’al salaries two years
it wiii.be a oolite retort.
It transpired that the biggest S’African
labor organisation lately “linked up” with
the Third Internationale at Moscow, which
is just What the N.S.W. Labor Council has
done. The S’Africans who joined in the orgy
of horror were apparently beguiled by the
jaromise that the Dutch farmer-soldiers
would rush in with the hope that the Third
Internationale at Trotskyville would give
them back their republic. Instead, these
Boers, marching with greater celerity than
most professional troops, came to the aid of
the Government, and the heart of the Red
movement was broken. Perhaps Australia
hasn’t got a citizen force quite like the Boer
commandoes, but it has got four times as
many Diggers who will never take orders from
Moscow or let Australia take them; and if it
hasn’t'a Smuts it has a Mora« h . So things
don’t look any promising for the
Moscow incend ; aries ip Australia than they
turned out to be in Africa,
The N. S. Wales system of proportional
represen tat on is not going to produce good
results until the people find out that, even
in a five-member constituency, they have each
only one vote certain. Thousands of them
go to the poll with the idea that they have
five votes and that the order in which they
put their party candidates doesn’t matter
much, if it matters at all. Actually, a man
might have an overwhelming majority of No.
5 votes —practically the whole district might
declare that be ought to be one of the five—
and yet he might be cast out utterly in the
earliest stages of the count. A lot of hard
, educating is called for if the system is to
stay.
Judge Beeby might be sent to the U.S.A.
again to write a supplement to his report on
price-fixing, etc. The Executive Council of
the American Federation of Labor has just
declared that “the practice of fixing wages
solely on a basis of cost of living is a viola-
tion of sound economy and is utterly with-
out logic or scientific support of any kind.”
And, of course, the Federation is wholly
right, The chicken-raiser can’t get 15 chicks
out of a dozen eggs, no matter how dear
chicken feed is.
Willis, the man who does most of the talk-
ing for the coal-miners of Australia, says
that the great solution of all the troubles
in that industry is to pool all the profits, and
then divide them among all the owners. As
Willis says, some mines are exceedingly
profitable. He would make these subsidise
the poorer or worse-managed ones, and then
these latter could pay more wages and sell
coal cheaper. Of course the others would then
AFTER THE GAME.
“The wild men of the N.S.W. Labor movement are making vague threats of securing their ends
by ‘other’ means in consequence of the reverses at the recent elections.”
MOD.: “Here, stow that, Mad! It's had enough not to be able to win; it's over the
odds not to he able to take a lickin'."
also have to pay more wages and sell cheaper.
That would reduce the subsidy they could pay
if it didn’t wipe it out altogether, and then,
getting no subsidy, but having to pay more
for wages and get less for coal, the poorer
collieries, which Willis confesses have a
struggle now, would shut up altogether. At
devising plans for creating unemployment
the Willises of the community are real
experts.
The British Government has given Aus-
tralia , another polite hint that it is merely
wasting its monev on State Governors. His
Ex. Nathan, of Queensland, had sent on the
Leg. Council Abolition Bill, along with a
largely-signed petition praying the King to
withhold his assent. To which the British
Government replied that the Queensland
Parliament had passed the bill, and, as it
was a domestic matter, that ended the busi-
ness —it wasn’t even for the King to say
no. And since domestic matters are the
only ones a State Parliament can deal with
—the High Court will see to that —obviously
an excuse no longer exists for maintaining
an expensive State Governor.
The Bulletin has a suspicion that the
Hun will yet demand the return, carriage
paid, of the barbed wire he left behind him
in France, as well as his ships and colonies.
He is prospering wonderfully, for he has no
ruined towns to rebuild, and his people
are toiling like beavers in their factories and
shipyards, preparing to commercially annex
the world. The Hun’s taxes are only about
half those paid in France and Britain, and
he refuses to increase them. A request for
another instalment of indemnity has been
met with a threat that he may join with
the Russian Bolsheviks and bash things.
The U.S. army of occupation is about to
leave over a claim that the republic should
have its expenses paid out of the bit of money
collected to help rebuild the broken towns,
and the Hun tail is further 1 exalted. In
fact, it begins to stand up like a lighthouse.
Queensland may have only one House of
Parliament to support now, having got rid
of the unpaid Chamber, but it is going to
find salaries for two Governors —tb» ortho-
dox one, and Bill Lennon as “Lieutenant.”
In other States the “Lieutenant”-Excel-
lency is paid only while he acts in the
uermanent man’s absence, but Bill will col-
lect all the time.
Cmef Commissioner Fraser, of the N. S.
Wales Railways, writes
The comparison of N 7. Sf , Wales railway freights
and fares with those of Victoria (B. 23/3/’22) has,
of course, to be read in conjunction with the fact
that the N. S. Wales system is heavily handicapped
in five distinct ways as against Victoria: (1) Higher
wages; (2) shorter hours; (3) higher interest bill;
(4) much longer hauls over much heavier grades;
(5) losses on non-paying country lines. In regard
to this final point, the last annual report of the
Commissioners showed- that .the. total loss on these
lines, after providing for working expenses and
interest, amounted to £875,789 for that year alone.
Under the Victorian Railways Act losses on such
lines are recouped to the Commissioners out of the
consolidated revenue. It will be readily understood,
I think, that the total burden of these, handicaps
expressed in £ s. d. would far outweigh the com-
paratively small differences between Victorian and
N. S. Wales charges.
Certainly. The Bulletin’s point is and
was that it is no use pretending N.S.W.
goods and passenger rates are low. They
are not and cannot be; and the handicaps
are so tremendous that the losses would be a
great deal more if the business wasn’t handled
by first-class men.
The Vic. Government is determined that
some plums shall go to returned soldiers.
Applications are now being invited from re-
turned men only for a well-gilded position.
The duties are “to act as night-watchman at
the wire factory, Pentridge; to fire and
attend to the galvanising pot (whep re-
quired) from 8 p.m. till 7.30 a.m. for seven
nights a week, and to do disciplinary work
when called on.” The hours are certainly
long, but to compensate for this the rate of
pay is—£lB4 per annum!
The defeat of leather-maker Hickey for
his old Botany seat, and the difficulty boot-
maker Min aha n experienced in getting even
a nomination, express the handicap of being
a useful producer and an up-to-date, true-
blue, all-wool Laborite at the same time.
Landlords like McGirr, or lawyers like Mc-
Tiernan, or men who were never more than
union secretaries and “organisers” can gaily
advocate a basic wage of £4O ss. or even
£45 4s. per week, and nail their flag to the
mast. But the man who is to pay the wage
and knows the impossibility of it can’t keep
pace with their enthusiasm, and is presently
marked as a trimmer and lukewarm.
“Animbra” from the heart of the Territory :
Jackson, M.H.R., hits the nail fair on the head
when he says that “if a bold policy of boring upon
settlement blocks is entered upon, the problem of
the empty North will be solved.” All the watered
blocks are stocked and have been for, anything up to
50 years. It remains for the Government to find
water on the unwatered country and settlement will
follow. But the railway is the only inducement that
will appeal to married men. There must be a get-
away for the womenfolk in times of stress. Water
first, the railway after; or, better still, both
together.
The dully “respectable” press of Australia
issues periodical warnings about excessive
borrowing, though it never has the courage
to propose swearing off altogether. And.
in its respectability, it always hurriedly nul-
lifies its words by saying that, of course,
no matter how much is borrowed, there is
no risk of default. As the Sydney Tele-
graph put it (30/3/’22) :
No sensible investor in the City of London, or any
other city, could cherish any doubt about the security
of his State as a State.
And no one can doubt the immortality of
Smith—until Smith dies, of course. The
immortality of Smith while he remains aiive
has often been commented on.
After making a nerve-racking journey by
car round a series of coastal precipices along
the Great Ocean-road, Premier Lawson
foretold a change in Victorian tourist-
resort policy: the annual vote is to be con-
centrated each year upon a specific work
instead of being spread thin over a score
of tracks and look-outs. This is taken to
indicate that Ocean-road promoters have
caught a big fish. The Great Enterprise,
after absorbing thousands of pounds of
hardly-canvassed private money, has reached
deadlock for want of funds, after landing
a trio of enthusiastic backers with an over-
draft of some £3OOO. Their motives have
been high enough. They have given theiT
money freely to try to open up unknown
beauties of scenery, have given a platoon
of Diggers two years’ work, and have pro-
vided (if they can manage maintenance
expenses and the road does not get washed
into the sea by the first winter rains) a
track which will prove’ useful to new settlers
who may some day take up the virgin hill
country through which the road runs. But
it is a very expensive and a very delicate
white elephant at present.
De Valera continues to stand out as the
best friend of Irish unity. Inside a few
hours last week Winston Churchill, in the
Commons, had announced, amidst applause,
that “the Government would not consent
to any alteration in the Irish treaty, how-
ever small,” and the House of Lords had
dropped its hostile amendments to the Free
State Bill, which forthwith received the
Royal Assent; Captain Craig had assured
that “Ulster would do all that
was possible to carry out the agreement,”
and Arthur Griffith had forecasted a unified
Ireland. What this means is that English
Unionism has joined hands with Irish
Nationalism—a phenomenon that nothing
but De Valeraism could have produced in
the time. When the attempt of a minority
to impose republicanism by force has been
checked the campaign may be undertaken on
the only lines tolerable to a civilised com-
munity—:by political propaganda. But the
scheme is much less likely to be voted for
in the future by the Moderates. Protestants
and Catholics, because of the bloodshed and
crime that are being used to back it now.
THE STAY-AT-HOMES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
God fashioned men in many moulds
And gave to each his part;
To some He gave the roving foot,
To some the homing heart.
There are sporting men and courting men,
And men that love to roam,
But best of all the men on earth
Are those that stay at home.
’Tis they who dig and build and hew,
And sow arid reap the ground—
The honest, plodding stay-at-homes
Who make the world go round.
The winds may call, the waves invite,
Yet life is ordered so—
A man may have the roving foot,
And yet in hobbles go.
There are working men and shirking men,
And men who lie and cheat;
But best of all the men on earth '
Are those with fettered feet;
For Duty’s sake and Honor’s sake
They labor unrenowned,
The honest, hobbled stay-at-homes
Who make the world go round.
God made the world and thought it good,
And if, with aim sublime,
Man thought the same, the good to best
He might transform in time.
There are lazy men and crazy men,
And men who travel far
Through dreams, beyond their age, to make
The earth a flawless star;
But those who are the salt of life,
And keep it sane and sound,
Are they the patient stay-at-homes
Who make the world go round.

GETTING THINGS READY FOR THE NEXT LOT.
“The Dooley (N.S.W.) Government, which lately refused a proffered loan in London, will leave the Treasury with an overdraft of five millions.
On the eve of the general election it scattered promises and guarantees, and started an unprecedented number of new works, including the City Railway.”

Income was almost £lOO,OOO larger than for
the previous year, and the increase was
easily a record for the City Mutual. The
totals shown in the table include, besides
premiums, the portion of the previous year’s
profit distributed and applied by share-
holders to the purchase of additional insur-
ance (£85,337 last year; £70,145 for 1920)
and also investment earnings. The latter
have in the past year benefited by consider-
able profits from sale of properties, invest-
ment account contributing £130,475 com-
pared with £94,427 in 1920. These two
items alone account for £51,240 of the addi-
tional income of £lOO,OOO. Another view
of the growth of the office can be got from
this comparison:—

1921 .. .. 261,293 88,415 2,168,487
It is a splendid achievement: premium in-
come has more than trebled in 10 years.
Meantime everything has gone so well that
surpluses have provided bonuses for policy-
holders which managing-director Geo.
Crowley claims are “the highest of any life
assurance society in the world.” As at
December, 1920, the actuaries reported a
surplus of £140,000, equal to 46 p.c. of that
year’s premium income, but only £88,924 of
it was taken to provide bonuses, and £85,337
of that .was used by policy-holders to add to
their cover.
Surpluses wffiicli provide bonuses are
derived from (1) a favorable claims experi-
ence, (2) a low expense rate, and (3) nigh
earnings from investments. But, first of all,
they depend on (a) the scale of pre-
miums and (6) the basis on which policy
valuations are made. In respect of (1),
though the City Mutual last year paid away
£12,000 more in death claims than in the
previous year, the society reports that “the
amount is much below the actuarial expecta-
tion.” Losses by death, including bonus
additions, have been as follows during the
past six years :
1916 .. £30,801 1919 .. £43,973
1917 .. 61,333 1920 .. 34,692
1918 .. 55,534 1921 .. 47,034
In the matter of costs, the first table shows
£106,000 more income won for an additional
outlay of £8621. Not regarding as income
the £85,000 of bonuses lelt with the society
to purchase additional insurance, but taking
credit for the unspecified profit from pro-
perty sales, the expense rate last year
worked out at 16.2 p.c. It has been lower,
but in view of the all-round increased cost
of administration, with no counterbalancing
increase of premiums, the rate is moderate,
particularly as income from new business
alone constituted one-fourth of the year’s
total premium income. New business is
costly to write, as the young cos. have found.
One of them told its shareholders the other
day that at one time “65 p.c. was considered
a very fair commission tor new Life busi-
ness : to-day no man will discuss Life busi-
ness with you under 80 to 85 p.c.” But the
first year’s business of some of the young-
sters has cost all the first premiums and
most of the second year’s—-perhaps the whole
of it. Though policy-writing conditions have
been favorable the City Mutual has not rushed
new business: the management strives to
make each year “just a little better than its
predecessor.” On this occasion two millions-
odd of new assurances were written. The
management allows for renewal business to
have cost 7i p-c. and estimates that less than
60 p.c. of first-premiums went in getting the
year’s new business. On The Bulletin’s
old formula of 7 p.c. as the cost of renewal
business, the £88,415 of new premiums cost
£60,300, or less than 69 p.c. That is much
lower than in many other old-established
offices.
The City Mutual also gets a bit more than
most from its investments. Its big line is
mortgages:—
„ ... _ 1913. p.c. 1921. p.c.
Public securities .. £111,825 15.6 £437,810 22.3
Mortgages . . 309,445 43.2 1,001,148 51.0

Cash & sundries .. 44,737 6.2 | 57,428 2.9
£717,110 £1,963,801
More than one-fourth of all assets is in
public securities and cash, the amount so
held representing at least times the
normal annual claims outgo. The society is
therefore in a position to meet promptly any
demands which are likely to be made upon
it. More than half the total funds are
advanced on mortgage, a satisfactory form
of investment so long as the management
knows its job and keeps awake. Even if
its mortgages earn only a point more than
public securities, the City Mutual gets at
least £lO,OOO more profit each year in that
way. Its investment policy is an import-
ant factor in providing distributable surplus.
For the rest, the Society, like all big
offices which have gone through hard times
and days of cheap money, takes no risks
when assuming the rate of interest its funds
will earn in the years to come. Though the
average interest earned now exceeds 0 p.c.,
policy valuations are made on the basis of
p.c. earnings. This estimate of liabilities
under policies provides a wide margin for
contingencies, so there is a substantial bit
up the sleeve when each year’s “profits” are
shaken out. In addition, after providing
the handsome bonuses, last year £51,000 of
the “profits” so revealed remained in hand,
The City Mutual is none the worse for some
of its unconventional methods, and if its
dealings in mortgages and properties keep
sound, it should hold tile place it has won
in the front rank of life offices. Funds at
Dec. 31 totalled £1,861,232, and there is, in
addition, £40,000 in a reserve for contin-
gencies, £lO,OOO of the recent profits from
property sales having been dropped in.

That last line does not suggest that inter-
state shipping has suffered much of a slump,
though how much of the profit comes from
shipping and how much from coal it is im-
possible to say. In any case, £65.000 of the
profit shown represents an addition to re-
serves, being “the balance of adjustment of
various accounts during war years and closed
during the year.” That leaves £319.372 as
the year’s net earnings, and is £9654 more
than claimed by the management, the net
amount dropped into the insurance fund dur-
ing the period. Still, on the directors’ show-
ing, net profits fell off only £3OOO. and the
prefs.’ 6 p.c. and the boom-time 14 p.c. for
the ordinaries were found with ease. On this
occasion, though, nothing visible has gone
into the big reserve for contingencies, taxa-
tion, depreciation, renewals, etc.; instead.
£5931 net has dropped out. This reserve ex-
panded as follows while earnings were lus-
cious and big profits were being made from
the sale of steamers:—
1914 . . .. £36,185 Increase £5,678
1915 .. .. 63,812 „ 27,627

1920 .. ~ 330.385 „ 87,891
1921 .. .. 324,474 Decrease 5,911
The £324.474 is not included with the re-
serves of the introductory table, though it is
pretty obvious that a large slice of it could
be so treated: certainly an accumulation
nine times that of seven vears ago, and equal
to 32.4 p;C. on capital, cannot be wholly
required for depreciation, contingencies, and
so on.
The war put Huddart Parker’s in a very
snug position. Apart from what gefauine
reserves may be in the contingencies pile,
since the old proprietary was passed over
to a public co. 10 years ago £700,000 or so
of profit has accumulated to help dividend-
earning. Paid capital is a million: half
in 6 p.c. prefs. and half in ordinaries. So
there are funds considerably in excess of
£1.200.000 to earn divs. for £500.000 of
ordinary capital: and in these circumstances
the 14 p.c. paid is not fat. A good deal
of the large surplus profits came from the
sale of steamships during the war-boom in
shipping, the book value of all fixed assets
and shares in other cos. having declined from
£922,576 in 1915 to £787,070 at the latest
balance. There was a £71,000 increase in
the account during the past 12 months, a
half-interest having been acquired in the
Tasmanian Steamers Prop. Ltd., which is to
run the Loongana, Nairana and Oonah, and
control has also been got of the Metropoli-
tan Coal Co. and its Helensburgh (N,S.W.)
colliery. But in the six years these changes
have taken place in the liquid position:—
1915. 1920. 1921.
Assets apart from
fixed assets .. £348,517 £1,612,675 £1,628,689
Liabilities.. .. 93,291 328,024 335,793
Surplus liquid assets £255,226 £1,284,651 £1,292,896
At December 31 there was 1J million or so
invested in Government and other securities,
an amount which far exceeds paid capital.
Sooner or later some of these gilt-edged secu-
rities will be converted into cash to finance
fleet additions: but though shipbuilding
prices have dropped, Huddart Parker’s has
so far not embarked on a construction pro-
gramme. The future depends a good deal
on the cost of replacing the vessels sold and on
the employment available for the new steam-
ers. If they are purchased cheaply and
trade is available, the co. should have a great
future. Few businesses have been able
to hohl on to their fat war profits as
some of the combined coal and shipping cos.
have done. Huddart Parker’s have the
additional benefit of a very large retail-coal
trade, and during the recent orgy of lavish
public spending the Bay and Geelong excur-
sion traffic must have been a gold-mine. Con-
sid«ring the relation of funds to capital things
will have to go very badly if reasonably good
divs. cannot be found for the ordinaries.

Between 1914-1921 British Tobacco showed
net profits, after deducting employees'
bonuses, of £3,817,376, and all except
£16,802 of it was distributed. Usually such
a slender margin would cause doubt as to a
co/s ability to maintain its div. rate. British
Tobacco, however, is in a category of its own.
It has never claimed that its disclosed profits
were the true net earnings of the huge enter-
prise; a small margin over and above the
amount required for divs. has been disclosed
each year, always with an accompanying
explanation: ‘‘the figures do not include
the co.’s interest in the undivided profits of
the subsidiary cos.” When the co. was formed
it was not intended that the public should
learn much of its operations. It is entirely
a holding concern, assets consisting almost
exclusively of scrip in a number of tobacco
cos. which it amalgamated. How well these
subsidiaries do cannot be ascertained, and
the most the British Tobacco shareholder at
any time could learn about his investment
was that the subsidiaries were not passing
all their profits on to the parent. A couple
of years ago, when tobacco became a “neces-
sary commodity” for price-fixing purposes,
and the Court allowed the subsidiaries to
increase their prices, it did not seem as
though much could have been withheld by
these companies. Nevertheless, just 12 months
ago, they presented the parent with bonus
scrip of a face value larger than any one
year’s profits which British Tobacco had
disclosed. Whether the £628,591 thus passed
on represented actual surplus earnings stored
up. or was in part the profit derived from
writing-up assets, was a matter on which
there was no whisper. However, that trans-
fer to the parent enabled it to distribute one
fully-paid bonus share for every eight previ-
ously held, and on the enlarged capital
quarterly divs. at the rate of 12 p.c. p.a.
have since been paid regularly.
Paid capital is now £7,153,669, £1,484,727
of it in 6 p.c. cum. prefs., and the balance £1
fully-paid ordinaries. Assets comprise
£5,398,061 shares in subsidiaries, £64,400 of
War Loan, and a surplus of book debts and
cash over liabilities of £1,728,608. All except
about a quarter-million «of the; ordinary
capital is represented by shares in cos. about
whose assets nothing whatever can be
learned. All the investor knows is that
British Tobacco is a deeply-entrenched com-
bine of all Commonwealth tobacco interests
of any importance, that over many years 12
p.c. has been paid reaularly, and that during
the past 12 months the same rate of div. has
been continued on capital increased one-
eighth bv a bonus issue. Only the select
few ins’de the Board room khow the true
state of health of the big concern.
Two years ago The Bulletin told the
Insurance Office of Australia that it was
chasing risky business apparently regardless
of the co.’s slender resources. Twelve
months ago this page did another shudder.
The 1.0. A. has now discovered these
things for itself. The past year’s accounts
are not yet available, but a preliminary
statement put out by the directors shows
how the reckless policy has landed the co.
in the bog. Last year, after allowing for
the profit from payable lines, there was an
underwriting loss of £30,000. Deducting
investment earnings and taking credit for
the appreciation of investments, a net loss
of £20,000 is anticipated.
The 1.0. A. has consequently got into such
a tangle that the directors announce: —
It would be impossible to safely carry on 'without
largely increasing the capital of the co., and this
could only be done by either issuing and obtaining
subscriptions for new shares, or making a call on
the members in respect of their shares.
The co. has been required to place cash deposits
exceeding £50,000 in the various countries where it
has opened branches, and is now required to find by
June 6 next £35,000 in cash under recent legisla-
tion in Maoriland. All these funds are consequently
withdrawn from the co.’s ordinary business opera-
tions.
Even with increased capital they could not look
forward with any certainty to paying a dividend
within the next two years.
“Under all the circumstances,” the directors
add, “they otter their assurance that the
interests of shareholders will be best con-
served” bv agreeing to allow an English
co. to take over : the North British and
Mercantile has offered 9s. per share provided
85 p.c. of 1.0. A. shareholders decide to quit.
Shares are 10s. each paid to 55., so the
North British offer of 9s. will no doubt, in
the circumstances, be accepted • and another
young Australian insurance office; which, if
it had been properly directed, might have
been developed into a robust concern, is to
receive burial in the vaults of an English
co.

Even that did not cover all shrinkages, for
the gradual unloading of the pile of subur-
ban allotments gave poorer prices than
book value, and right down to 1912 small
annual losses were made. Since 1905 these
changes have shown up in the balance-sheets :
1905. 1910. 1915. 1920. 1921.

Since discharging its old liabilities the man-
agement has never gone outside for a penny;
new advance business has been regulated by
the inflow of cash from realisation of old
properties. Of the liabilities of £1538 at
December 31 last no less than £1192 was in
respect of unclaimed divs. The co. has held
on to two leasehold estates —at the Glebe
and Waterloo—and two years ago the free-
hold of the latter was acquired. The Glebe
leasehold now has a book value of £18,500
—£2ooo regularly disappears from the books
each year—and last year it earned £5320.
The Waterloo freehold stands at £10,625,
and last year contributed £1055 to income.
So, after long waiting, these old properties are
giving the co. fat returns. A trifle of the
lost capital was replaced two years ago,
£9OOO of reserves having been added to the
written-down capital of £45,000.
Apparently members of the House of Coir
mons knew nothing more about the Austra-
lian zinc contract than The Bulletin had
told them : it was the one source quoted dur-
ing the debate. A little official information
was added: that on an output of 166,000
tons last year the British Government’s
ascertained loss Was £600,000; that there
is a present loss of £5 per .ton on
each of the 250,000 tons p.a. the Govern-
ment has contracted, to buy; that the con-
tract runs for eight years longer; that it

There is joy in the manure camps.
Baillieu and Swinburne wore down the Cus-
toms till a 50s. duty on sulphur was granted.
Tfiat snould put tue superpaosphate industry
on a good footing. The Electrolytic Zinc
crowd are happier: they will now be suffici-
ently protected to enable them to burn
the sulphur out of the zinc-concentrates for
Itisdon, leaving it with a product practi-
cally calcined. The arrangement should
suit the Mount Lyell co. well, as its pyrites
ought to be -mod enough for use without
calling upon Broken Hill for concentrates.
The new duty recalls one of the humorous
incidents of the war. The Defence and other
departments were cluttered up with officials
who had to do something to justify their
mostly-superfluous jobs; so that when The
Bulletin preached once more that Australia
should save the hundreds of thousands of tons
of sulphur in Australia, and incidentally save
precious steamship tonnage, it wasn’t n bit
surprised to receive from one of Billv
Hughes’s new departments a stern rebuke.
The talk of saving sulphur, it was informed,
was mischievous, and was calculated in some
mysterious way to help Germany win the
war. The head of the “bureau” that was
responsible for this joke was afterwards
given an 0.8. E. He had earned it.
* * * *
From a man who should know: —
There were other reasons besides those mentioned
by the “Wild Cat” (B. 9/8/’22j which led to the
cessation of operations at Great Cobar (N.S.W.).
One was the gradual depletion of the basic ore in
the mine, necessitating the employment of some other
process than direct blast-furnace smoltinsr. Annther
was the peculiar conditions under which the receivers
for the debenture holders were operating and which
made it necessary for them to obtain the sanction of
the Court to secure fresh funds, and the Court is
reluctant at all times to permit of any capital expen-
diture unless a certain profit can be seen over and
above an amount sufficient to recoup the new capital.
The Fort Bourke, or Cobar Gold-mine, possesses
a large reserve averaging Bdwt. This mine was
recognised by the receivers as having a less fluctuat-
ing value than either the copper-mine or the Chesney,
which rely mainly on their copper content. They
experimented with the ore from Fort Bourke with the
object of determinating whether both gold and
copper values could be extracted in one operation.
These tests were entirely successful, and based upon
them it was proposed to raise £lOO,OOO to carry
a scheme into effect which would have meant treat-
ment by flotation of 200 tons per .day.
This scheme was finally altered to one whereby
£50,000 would be required, together wifch an
additional £30,000 to cover expenses for the first
three months until the product was realised upon.
A rise in wages and freight about this time made the
realisable profit on ‘ reserves in the Fort , Bourke
so small that the scheme was abandoned. Under the
receivership, operations would have been subject to
two very unfavorable conditions: (1) Extremely heavy-
administrative charges, which included the fees and
expenses of the English and Australian receivers and
the committee appointed by the Court, in addition
to the cost of the necessary technical staff ; (2) the
receivers’ work was limited by the Court to treat-
ment of the present ore reserve. They had to
recoup cost of plant and make profits wholly from
this ore. These heavy expenses and restrictions
made the cost of operating a small plant almost pro-
hibitive.
The' present position is that the existing ore
reserves in the Fort Bourke alone , are, more than
sufficient to pay for a plant. Quite apart from the
Cobar Gold-mine, there is every possibility of estab-
lishing a plant to treat ore from the other mines at
a profit. The present owners believe that a possible
monthly tonnage of 20,000, or nearly double Great
Cobar’s, output during its last run, can be success-
fully treated.

South Lucknow was got from a syndicate
to a N.L. co. in a fortnight, all the contrib.
shares having been placed and £2500 cash
got in with not a penny spent on broker-
age Or promoters. The only fly in the
ointment was that State stamp duties took
almost £4OO, though if the co. had been
registered in Victoria not more than £l5
would have been demanded. The injustice
of such a levy on enterprise will, no doubt,
be brought before the new Mines Minister.
The stiff duties threaten to make Melbourne
the home of N. S. Wales floats, or as
an alternative, induce promoters to under-
capitalise at the beginning and jeopardise
the chances of adequately financing ventures
when funds are most needed. Work pro-
ceeded at the South Lucknow while the
transfer was being effected, two shifts being
nut on to sink the new shaft, which in
weeks has gone down and been timbered
to -35 ft. Water has become troublesome and
country is hard diorite, so the next 20 to
30 feet will be slower. A crosscut will then
go out to pick up the' joint, and driving
will commence both ways. In the' earlier
development work the spur at its toe went
up to 12oz. The South Lucknow has so
far given indications identical with uiose
met in the rich ground worked to the north
in the long ago; and within 10 weeks or so
shareholders sliouid know a lot more.
On the adjoining show, the Lucknow
Pups, values are improving in the fout-
wail drive on the joint. For the last six
weeks the veinstuff has given off the garlic
odor which suggests arsenical pyrites. Assays
have confirmed the suggestion, and values
have improved from to 21dwt., drill-
ings in one instance going 2oz. 3dwt. The
veinstuff having widened to 6in. and the
whole face looking lodey, an average sample
has been sent away to ascertain treatment
possibilities. The mine opinion is that
directly the buck-reef material on the joint
is left behind and the serpentine hanging-
wall is picked up the Pups will begin to
bark. This co. has so far made no calls;
the £625 raised at flotation should cover
exes, to the end of next month.

New Burragorang (N.S.W.) has gone
into liquidation after a long and not too
satisfactory career. It has produced large
quantities of lead and silver, in the distri-
bution of the value of which miners, carters
and smelters have been the principal parti-
cipants, only a few crumbs being left for
shareholders. It is understood that the syn-
dicate which has purchased the property
intends to give old shareholders an oppor-
tunity to join a new co. on a preferent basis.
It is aiso proposed to take over another pro-
perty in the district.

Celebration’s 10-head mill has commenced
operations at Hampton Plains (W.A.).
When the show was floated for a quarter-
million the main-shaft was worth about
lodwt. at most. Since then development
has proved the shoot to cut out at about
100 ft. down, and also that it extends very
little distance north or south. But the ore
to be treated will be got out cheaply, as the
mine is well opened up to 100 ft.
The market appears to attach to Ingliston,
Meekatharra (W.A.), a value not justified
by performances or prospects. . The co.
has 106,000 shares issued, for which there
are buyers at 10s. The property has been
worked 20 years or so, and has produced
approximately 20,000 tons, giving 19,0000 z.
(fine). The co. has had its own treatment
plant for six years, and for this period has
averaged 3000 tons per annum for an ounce
average. In ordinary circumstances that
grade would mean divs., but the Ingliston
lode is on the slim side, country rock is hard
and development work behind the require-
ments of the treatment plant. The chances
of the show giving the £53,000 at which it is
appraised by the market are not bright.
Mutooroo Junction (W.A.j has engaged a

yet been proved in the new locality.

A. L. Hay goes to Papua to run Block
10, Misima, which has had four managers
in its short career. Before quitting A. W.
Wincey administers a bitter pill to share-
holders. Reg Williamson, Wincey’s prede-
cessor, estimated ore reserves at 262.401
tons, averaging 335. 6d. Wincey slashes
the total to 177,506 tons, and divides it into
86,481 tons averaging 375. 7d„ and 31,025
tons worth only 20s. Sd. and not good enough
if costs cannot be got down' a lot. Win-
cey’s estimate has shaken the foundations
of, not only Williamson’s, but also the late
O. B. Ward’s estimate of the proposition.
The Board says it does not “feel justified
in altogether ignoring” the reports of its
former managers “until the position has
been further investigated.” Last half-year’s
record was dismal. Misima must depend
on a large tonnage to get costs down. Only
18,400 tons went to the mill, which was
about half its capacity. ’Flu and floods
were the cause. The grade was 30s. lid.,
and as recovery was 28s. good mill-
work was done. But the net resiilt was a
loss of £6378, after writing off £1616 dropped
by realising on plant no longer required.
However, the battery tonnage is now up to
5000 tons monthly, and the corner may be
scraped round with aid from B. H. Block
10 and its faithful. Misima opened the
gamble with £200.000 in shares of £1 each,
but a lot of that was water. Then it in-
creased £150,000 in three inmps of £50.000
each. Now a further £50.000 increase is pro-
posed. The mine account represents £181,974,
and plant, machinery and snares £145,400.
while the debit at P. and L. has gone to
£42.570. At Dec. 31 £8094 was owed to
sundrv creditors, and £25 000 on mortgage.
T-ioir'd assets : Cash, £6992; sundrv debtors,
£7733: spares and stores. £23,166, The
mine is worked by black brother, who has
not proved cheap. Wincey reports that work
lias got down to the sulphide zone, so he
recommends sinking and the testing of the
pyrites to see if present methods are applic-
able to non-uxidised ore. Also, there oiten
is a ciiange in grade when sulphides make.
That alone spells caution, h unds are so
tight that even the essential hydro-electric
scheme will have to wait.
Between January 7 and March 3 Rawang’s
12in. plant ran 1218 hours, treating 7U,U00
cubic yards for 4a tons tin. Maicoim .New-
man’s co. recently placed tenders for the
new r electric-power station, and for the first
unit of the large gravel-pumping plant. The
installation is on the lines forecasted m the
prospectus of the co. nearly two years ago.
In view of the abnormal prices which manu-
facturers all over the world demanded for
machinery when tenders were called a year
back, the directors decided not to place
orders until prices became more reasonable.
The substantial reductions which recently
took place mean a saving of 425,U00 on the
12-months-oid quotations. The total present
outlay on matemal is £42,000, and as less
than £20,000 will provide the second unit
it is evident that Rawang’s subscribed capi-
tal is more than sufficient for its require-
ments. .During the two years Since the
Malayan co. was floated the steam-driven
12m. grayei-pumping plant nas vvorueu con-
tinuously, and has essentially verified the
prospectus figures and estimates. In the
present paddock the plant has averaged
40,000 yd. per month, yielding 1 Jib. tin
oxide per yd. (Justs, wmen uurmg 1020
rose to a very high figure, have in recent
months been brought down to those fore-
casted in the prospectus, and even at to-
day’s low price of tin the small-capacity
plant now running is showing a little profit.
The new plant, owing to its larger capacity
and small steam-consumption, should give
low working costs. It is anticipated that
the first new pumping unit will be in opera-
tion within the next 12 months. The com-
bined output of the first 14in. plant and
the present 12in. outfit should be 100,000 yd.
to 120.000 yd. per month. Next year a
monthly yardage of 180,000 to 200,000 is
expected, giving a tin yield of about 120
tons, as anticipated in tne prospectus. With
oxide fetching £B5 per ton net, the yield
would be worth about £lO,OOO. The cost
of producing it is estimated at about £oouo.
The bore on the Palmer River goldfield
(N.y.) proved to be Jim Watters’s last min-
ing venture. The old man hoped to live
to see the resuscitation of the once-famous
field, and the initial bore was down on the
Ida lease 100 ft. when he passed out at Cook-
town. _ The syndicate which is backing his
faith in the field is carrying on. Govern-
ment-borer Berry is in charge of the plant
wffiich has been loaned by the Minister for
Mines. Geologists are pessimistic as to pros-
pects for reefing on this old alluvial field,
and, anyhow, regard diamond drilling as
likely to give fallacious results when applied
to the localising of auriferous shoots in reefs.
Queensland intends to get a small State
colliery going in the Roma district, mainly
for south-western railway demands. This
will save at least 200 miles’ haulage from
the Oakey district, on the Downs. The
seams cross the Injune Creek line about 30
miles from Roma, and were first brought to
notice by L. Boyd, a stockman on Mt. Corn-
wall run. A Government borer is on the job
now alongside the railway, and a sft. seam
which should be workable, despite a few
bands, has been located at a shallow depth.
As the seam is very flat it lies close to the
soil for a big stretch. Boyd thought of work-
ing the seam, but there is room for only one
small colliery, and about 320 tons a day will
cover local requirements for a long time.

Zeehan is again begging. This time it
wants the State to pass out £20,000 for a
transmission line and equipment to convey
power from the Lake Margaret station.
The main argument is that rich silver-lead
ore •is available for extraction, pro-
vided there is cheap power to cope with
the heavy mine water, At the Public Works
inquiry the witnesses declared that the ore
deposits have as yet only been scratched.
Geologist Hills, in his evidence, said that
the majority of the 200-odd lodes worked
from time to time had become impoverished
or petered out at from 50 to 350 feet down,
though with facilities for handling the water
economically Zeehan might be a producer
of galena for many years to come, from
surface down to 350 feet. He does not
subscribe to the suggestion that the Zeehan
deposits are of secondary enrichment, and
that pay ore is not likely below 350 feet.
Still, the experience of companies that
went in for deep sinking, such as the
Montana and Western, and their with-
drawal from operations all over the area,
is evidence that something happened to the
ore-grade at depth. Had the mines carried
the surface grade and width down, water
wouldn’t have stopped some of the cos. Elec-
trolytic Zinc is giving a shove to the pro-
posed power scheme, but is. as usual, reticent
as to what it proposes to do in Zeehan,, and
tendered evidence in private. The report
is sure to be favorable, as there is an elec-
tion pending and the scheme—advocated 2U
years ago by Government Surveyor Wilson—
will at any rate give mining, prospecting and
timber-getting a boost in the district.

The Magnet (Tas.) is re-opening, and the
silver-lead ore is to be vigorously extracted
Development work along the bottom levei
should be interesting, and perhaps explain
the rush of local shareholders to sell when
the lode was cut in the new crosscut. The
mine has recently had the benefit of a slight
reduction in wages from the Federal Court,
but is up against high transport and return-
ing charges, and little profit, if any, will be
won under existing conditions.
Osmiridium has now, under direction of
the Government pool, risen from £l5 to £2O
per oz. advance for first-class metal and
diggers are elated. Many of the old hands
had left the fields owing to the low price
and the Government restriction which pre-
vented the metal being used by diggers for
adjustment of their store debts. The
diggings have now been well raked, some
of the richer ground having been turned over
five times by different parties, and the general
opinion is that £35 per oz. is required to
revive work in a big way.

Good prospects continue to be reported
from No. 1 tunnel of the Linton gold-mine
(Tas.), where the stone is over a foot wide
and carries gold freely in a formation of 3ft.
Gold is very fashionable just now with
Tasmanian investors, and from the pros-
pecting that is going: on on the north-east
coast a good mine might easily emerge.

No Chief Justice in the history of the
British Empire had a humbler beginning
than McCawley, who succeeds Pope Cooper as
Chief Justice of Bananaland. He began as
a newsboy and educated himself for the most
part by working at night. At 15 he got
into a solicitor’s oflice and in 10 years was a
gent, one himself. Inside another decade he
was a Judge, and now, while on the right side
of 40, he holds one of the highest positions in
the gift of an Australian Government.

double the salary. Four years ago, when
Bowser was Premier, Norman came into col-

Botany (N.S.W.) —he displaced Simon
Hickey—has been for three years an aider-
man of Redfern, was a 1917 tramway
.striker and contested the electorate in 1920.
On this occasion the bosses of the Labor
machine allotted him fifth or “dummy”
position in the electorate; whereupon he
attacked the sitting Labor members and the
A.L.P. executive; and that Botany sympa-
thised with him is shown by the 5816
primary votes he polled as against the 1300-
odd last time. He has been expelled, of
course; but expulsion from a party that is
on the verge of disruption may not be so
serious as it looks. Ratcliffe belongs to the
raucous-voiced, militant section, and is a poor
substitute for the man he has displaced.
Departed Justice Hood’s failure to mention
his wife or his daughter Florence, the violin-
ist, in splitting up his £58,000 emphasises a
long estrangement. The old man had in
recent years mellowed from an earlier
crotchetiness which often showed in court;
still the three codicils to his will are very
human documents in proof of his irascibility.
In one of them he deprived a daughter of
£2OOO and in another he cut a son down
from £5OOO to a bare thousand.
“Rio”: If breeding goes for anything
Massy Greene should be a great success with
the Defence portfolio. His mother is a
sister of Sir Robert Sandeman (“Sinniman
Sahib”), the famous Indian soldier and
administrator, and his father was a nephew
of that Captain Hopson who was first' Gov-
ernor of Maoriland. and after whom is
named the wetness that the Yarra empties
into.

Council is at present gazing regretfully at
the popular Professor’s letter of resignation
and wondering what can be done about it.
As the institution j is always impecunious
(nobody makes fat Requests to this Univer-
sity) it seems probable that a few months’
leave of absence on full pay, plus an
“Emeritus,” is all th<e old Professor will get.
He is still well and hearty (during the past
few months he has published a text-book and
made a rapid recovery from a badly-broken
leg), and looks like living until 90 or so—•
maybe because it has been his custom for
many years to his vacations roaming
about the foothills of his beloved Mt. Wel-
lington.
Professors aren’t wildly keen on boxing,
as a rule, but the first man in Maoriland to
know the result of the Dempsey-Carpentier
slogging was PPof. Bobby Jack, of Otago
’Varsity. With his wireless he picked up
the result direct from the Bordeaux, station
before the papers got the news. Jack’s hobby
just now is wireless telephony. With a
tiny plant he is able to talk from Dunedin
to Auckland ar anvwhere else in M.L., and
reckons to call up Sydney any time now.
R.C. Bishop Liston, of Auckland, whom
the Maoriland Government is smiting on
account of alleged seditious utterances, is a
vigorous, wiry cleric, medium-sized, black-
haired. eagle-eyed and be-spectacled, with a
long thin nose and wide, sharp mouth; and
in spite of his aggressive chin he is a great
hand at a tea-drinking. The speech that
caused the trouble was delivered in Auckland
Town Hall, and Mayor Gunson when he
read the report next day was a very wild
man. As the chief magistrate of the city,
he submitted a copy of the speech to the
Crown Law Otfioe, and now some tongues
are wagging as they never wagged before.
Leather-maker Simon Hickey, just
defeated Labor M.L.A. for Botany (N.S.W.),
can claim that he will save the country more
than the allowance he drew. Last session,
at his instigation, a stock-branding bill was
passed which limits the size of brands to two
inches, and requires them to be placed low
down on the shoulder or flank of the beast.
Brands up to six inches, with any number
of letters and numerals, used to be burnt into
the most valuable portion of the hide on the
ribs or rump, utterly destroymg the leather
value where it touched, besides representing
the same sort of loss as a crooked log in a
cultivation paddock—the toiler has to work
round it.
The cableman who broke the news that
our Lenin might be taken from us was the
usual Son of Stodge- He explained cautiously
that the gentleman was suifering from “an
internal complaint,” as if it was customary
for people to die of external complaints,
the patient being in Sydney and the com-
plaint in Adelaide. He even went further
and said the Dictator’s condition was seri-
ous, lest people might fancy it was comic
and that they were expected to laugh at the
funeral.
Henry Orrill, of Crow’s Nest (Sydney),
has given £4OO in Treasury bonds towards
building a new wing to the Women’s Hospi-
tal at Paddington. He is a native of Syd-
ney, 87 years old, and when he was a boy
the site of the hospital was his playground.
The operations for the suppression of a
“boy bushranger,” Maple, at Neerirn North
(Vic.), the other day brought to light an
unusual J. Hop in senior-constable Ryan, of
Warragul. For 27 years he has been wear-
ing the uniform in some of the wildest parts
of Victoria, and has brought in various tough
cases without handcuffs; he seems to rely on
a kindly nature to wean the captive from
thoughts of escape. Ryan is said to be the
best-read man in the force. He is familiar
with the classics, and quotes Horace as easily
as Keats, Milton and Shakspeare.
Major Wally Conder, who picked up the
Pentridge governorship while running for the
succession to Gellibrand as Victorian poiice
commissioner, was the man who set Lang-
warrin camp to rights after several older
officers had messed up that highly disorderly
spot. Conder, who had been severely
stoushed on Gallipoli but was eager for some
job. went to Langwarrin, put the men on
their honor not to break camp, took down
the barbed-wire stockade which had been
built round them, and soon had all busy
changing the dreary waste into a miniature
Eden. There were few cases of A.W.L. at
Langwarrin afterwards.
“Billy C.”: Dr. Chas. Ryan, “The Thud
King,” could appreciate a joke against him-
self. Once, I think it was at Ghezirah, a
genuine nerve case came before his Majesty
and was duly thudded after he had pitched
a tale that should have shifted the Sphinx.
Retiring to his quarters the Digger turned
out a striking black-and-white sketch of the
Board with a double amputation case before
it, and Ryan saying: “Hum. Leg and arm
gone, eye seriously impaired. How are your
ears? Right, eh? Go back—you’ll do for
listening-post.” It was shown to a nurse,
who promptly seized it and exhib ; ted it all
round. There was no court-martial.
“N.K.” sees a tombstone :—■
In the South Brisbane cemetery the other day I
came across the grave of Pat Kenniff, hanged in
Boggo-road (Brisbane) gaol in 1904 for his part in
the murder of, station-man Dalke and police-constable
Doyle in the Carnarvon Ranges. Pat’s little plot
is in a lonely-looking hollow, far from the general
portion. The grave has a neat cement railing around
it, and at its head stands a small cross, bearing the
inscription: “Patrick Kenniff. R.1.P.” It is not
usual for a hanged man’s grave to be so adorned, and
it is only in the last few years that the inscription
made its appearance. The day I was there a kindly-look-
ing old lady was placing flowers on the mound. She
possibly was one of the many who had grave doubts
as to the guilt erf the hanged man.
Arthur Rodgers, Hughes’s chubby Minister
of Customs, resents a Melbourne suggestion
that Walter Leitch, of the newly-appointed
Tariff Board, is a Freetrader. Rodgers
regards Leitch as one of the most passionate
Protectionists he has ever encountered. In
fact, Herbert Brookes, another member of
the Board and a prominent Australian manu-
facturer whose Protectionist attitude has
never been in doubt, is almost a Cobdenist
by comparison. For many years Leitch was
a director of Joseph Baker and Co., a large
British firm which manufactures machinery
for the bakery and confectionery trade.
Later he started a branch in the U.S.A. —
and that was a tribute to a Protectionist
policy which he shouldn’t have missed. Dur-
ing the war he gave the Commonwealth
Government the benefit of his knowledge as
an industrial chemist.
“Te W.”: Thomas Sutcliffe Mort was not,
as many think, the first Sydney woolbroker.
O. B. EbSvvorth, who had premises in Pitt-
street, not far from Circular Quay, was the
pioneer. His descendants include Charles
and Ifrank Ebsworth, well-known Sydney
lawyers. “Handsome Tom Dawson,” a con-
temporary of Mort, was the first Sydney
fat-stock salesman, and, I think, also held
the first sale of stud sheep—long-pedigreed
jumbucks imported from Saxony and Spain.
That particular sale was held on Pinchgut,
or some other island in Port Jackson, on
which, for fear of scab, the imported ani-
mals were kept until they were declared
“clean.” Tom Dawson flourished exceed-
ingly for a time, but died poor. He was
a fine shot. In my infant days I occasion-
ally attended him when ouail-shooting on
the Monaro plains, and there were few
nrsses, though he was then long past his
prime.
The job of Professor of Bacteriology and
Public Health at Otago (M.L.) ’Varsity,
rendered vacant by the death of Dr. Champ-
taloup, goes to Maorilander Peter MacCal-
lum, assistant clinical pathologist of the
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. MacCallum.
who was educated at Christ’s College and
Canterbury College, got his M.Se. in 1908
and his M.A. in 1909. From 1910 till 1914
w^ n dered about Scotland collecting the
alphabet, and then he put on the pretties
ot the R.A.M.C. and didn’t lay them aside
until the finish.
CARLYLE SMYTHE , who, like his father,
has spent most of his life managing
lecture and other tours.
Slater, Labor M.L.A. for Dundas, who has
got through all Ills law exams, since he
came back from the war, has put up his
sign-board at. Hamilton (Vic.).
Passed out at 92, Michael Lynch, a Wim-
mera and Mallee (Vic.) pioneer. He left
the Ould Sod when 19, and after 10 years
in U.S.A. the Vic. goldfields lured him south
in 1858; but it wasn’t long before the land
claimed him.
The Carnegie “Foundation for Inter-
national Peace,” of the U.S.A., wants for its
division of International Law a study of the
work of Gentilis, an Italian jurist of the
16th century, who came before the more
famous Grotius, and was a power in his
day. The directors have asked Coleman
Pbillipson to prepare it. He is the brilliant
Jew whom the University of Adelaide lately
secured as its Professor of Law.
Among the men to get away from the
rapidly falling edifice of the Repat. Depart-
ment is Beresford, chief account-
ant in Sydney. He becomes accountant
to the University vice Hubert Dallen, re-
tired after 35 years* service. Beresford,
who is a South Australian, served with the
A.M.C., then on being invalided in T 6
became Chief Clerk of the S.A. Soldiers’
Fund, and joined the Repat. when it started.
A little pleasantry of Jocook’s seems to
have disclosed prematurely that Hughes is
tired of Percy Hunter as emigration chief-
tain in London, or that, Hunter is to get Gul-
iett’s place nearer the Sun. Probably it is
the former, for Hughes has had to check
Hunter’s enthusiasm as well as Gullett’s,
and was much annoyed with a recent blithe
intimation that he could start forthwith
sending 100,000 new settlers yearly. Some
significant changes have already been taking
place in Hunter’s department in Australia
House. H. C. Smart has got back to his
old job as Australian publicity agent, and
“Jack” Barnes, who went from Queensland
as a voluntary worker in the immigration
cause, has taken up a salary as second-in-
command.
“M.S.F.”: A Scotch policeman in Adel-
aide was one of 16 brothers. Five were
killed in the retreat from Mons, four were
drowned m naval engagements, four others
were variously killed (some drowned) and
one died in bed. Two left out of 16, and
one of them was wounded at the war.
“Verri”: “Your Money Counts Always,”
the Diggers’ interpretation of Y.M.C.A..
was smart; but the best thing of the kind
is the name given the North Auckland
Mounted Rifles. This co. includes many
members of the well-known Mackersev
family, which supplied whole platoons and
colonels and majors, captains and juniors in
the war. Inquirers are solemnly told that
the “N.A.M.R.” badge stands for “Nearly
All Mackersey’s Relations.”
A BALLADE OF NOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For the age of gold that the old poets sing,
Lamenting in many a mournful lay,
For leopard-skin, vine-wreath and that sort of thing,
Its no use sighing, they’re gone for aye ;
They were all very well, but they’ve had their day.
There are sights worth seeing in this a.d.,
And after a stroll down the Block I say:
The age of the saucy silk stocking for me!
Great farthingales’, crinolines’ haughty swing
May have looked quite charming when youth was
gay;
To tempestuous petticoats' hampering cling
Danced many a laughing light-foot fay
Who in bygone summers of hearts made hay.
But give me the twinkle of feet set free,
And delicate ankles’ demure display—
The age of the saucy silk stocking for me!
Oh, Youth is Youth, and the Spring’s the Spring,
As bright, as light as the foam on the bay ;
And our grandparents doubtless had their fling,
Though they preach and shudder, their hair grown
grey;
But let them maunder, nor say them nay
When they praise the past over things that be;
Here’s a toast to the Present, while they inveigh:
The age of the saucy silk stocking for me!
Envoy.
And, Fate, you are kind when you plan my way
By post-office corner and tram and quay
Where breezes make prettiest disarray!
The age of the saucy silk stocking for me!
VICTORIA,
RIKKI.

SOCIETY
“Bush Doctor” : I was passing down the
track from Stringers, where I had been pay-
ing a friendly call on the Sunday afternoon,
when a woman came from a house buried
among trees about 200yds. from the road,
waving her white apron. “You’re Dr. Anon,
aren’t you?” said she. “I want you to come
in and have a look at Bill’s finger. He
bursted it up at the mill Wednesday, and
it’s lookin’ ugly and givin’ a lot of pain.”
I went in and found Bill nursing a very
swollen hand. A glance was sufficient. “You
should have had this attended to at the
time,” said I. “It will have to come off.,”
THE PREY AND THE HUNTER.
“We women are just as clever as you men.”
“Cleverer than some sorts of men.”
“What sort do you mean?”
“The married sort.”
“What, the finger or the ’and?” asked Bill
dully. “The finger.” “’Ow much of her?”
“The whole finger.” “Oh, all right,” Bill
agreed: “I s’pose it can be done.” “I will
be back within three hours,” I explained,
and rode off for the necessary implements.
When I returned Mrs. Bill met me at the
front door. “It’s all right, doctor,” she
said; “he’s done it.” “Done what?” 1 ex-
claimed. “He’s done it,” she continued. I
went in haste to my patient. Bill was very
pale and the finger was gone. "How could
you be such an idiot?” I asked. Bill looked
troubled. “Well, didn’t yeh say it ’ad to
come off?” he pleaded. “I thought I had to
have it ready for you.” He had cut off
his finger with the axe so as to /have it
ready” for me. That’s your bushman —the
reallest gentleman God ever made, if being
a gentleman means having consideration for
others.

“T.R.H.”; In one matter Sydney needs
to give its police force a dig. I
spent a recent night in the Domain
—not far from Mrs. Macquarie’s
Chair. I know there is a merciful
unwritten law that the homeless
may sleep there Undisturbed. But
some/ of the moral Offal go there
for quite another purpose which
screams aloud for the interference
of the police. During the night
only one uniformed policeman put
in an appearance fOr five minutes.
To deal with, the unspeakable
horrors I am hinting at three or
four detectives are wanted —preferably clean
shaven and dres&ed in sailors’ uniforms.

“X2X”: Hypnotism is no longer the
monopoly of the showman and the charlatan.
A demonstration of treatment by this
“power” was given at a hospital in Mel-
bourne the other day in the presence of a
small group of doctors, and if any were
inclined to scoff at the beginning they weren’t
at the end. The patient had been suffering
from a minor nervous complaint which had
defied the doctors for years ; yet, after lesc
than an hour’s treatment, he was completely
relieved. In France and the United States
hypnotism has been extensively made use of
in medicine, and during the war a special
hosnital was established in the former
country for the hypnotic treatment of shell-
shock. In America drug-addicts and habit-
ual drunkards have been successfully treated,
and so assured has hypnotism’s place in
medicine become that lately the authorities
of the New York State Drug Addiction
Clinic sanctioned the opening of a hypnotic
ward with a special staff. There is still
a vast deal to be -learned, but even now-
hypnotic-methods can be applied with safety
and succ,ess in a considerable field of curative
and with advancing knowledge
they are certain to come more and more
info use. The charlatan kept the profession
off the subject for many ypars ; but science
can’t afford to waste valuable agents because
quacks misuse them.
» * * *
“Monaro”: I don’t know if there’s such
a thing as luck in the world; there’s oer-
tainly something that
plays queer tricks
with the human pawn
in the; game of life.
Two mates o’ mine
were digging out rab-
bits. One reached up
the burrow. “Just
touched him,” he said ;
“you try.” The other
tried, and immediately
whipped his hand out
with a tiger-snake at-
tached ’to a finger. A
week or two after-
wards the first man
was working in a
gravel-pit, and the
boss called him away
from the face for
something. He hadn’t
walked six paces
when a dozen tons of
earth came down,
severely injuring his
three mates. Later,
feeding a chaffcutter,
he got his hand caught
in a pitece of wire that
was going through.
In two seconds he’d
have lost his hand,
probably his arm.
But it was a gusty
day, and just then the
driving-belt jumped
off. The heavily-fed
chaffcutter stopped
nearly dead; but so
close, was it that we
had to turn the wheel
back fid release his hand, and he drew it out
uninjured.
* * * *
“Dido” : A man can’t be too careful. In
a Melbourne restaurant at dinner the other
night three men, all very “merry,” were at
one table: one was so drunk indeed that
he occasionally drowsed, and fhe waiter had
to shake him up and remind) him of the
proprieties. At another tabl? two matrons
presently seated themselves, and see-sawing
out the drunkest of the drunks collided with
the chair in which one ctf these was seated.
He apologised, and called her Nellie. The
lady glared, but it w-as not till he begged
Neilie to kiss and be friends that the indig-
nant dame commanded the waiters to seize
and remove the obnoxious fellow. He was
duly grabbed and towed from the premises.
“IN FOR A PENNY. IN FOR A
POUND.”
“Are you still angry with your husband?”
“Oh, yes. You see, after the quarrel began
I decided I might just as get a
silk frock out of it as a mere pair of
gloves."
Said the other lady: “Why, I thought he
was your husband.” “So he is,” was the
scornful reply. “But I am not Nellie.”
* * * *
“S.S.”: George had a little too much way
on, or she would not answer her helm as a
good motor should. Anyhow, he dashed into
a pedestrian on St. Kilda road, and sent
him into the middle of one of the street gar-
dens, where two or three people gathered and
proceeded to assess damages. “He’s dead,”
said a small, precise gentleman, kneeling by
the side of the prostrate one./“As a door-
nail,” corroborated another. George, hearing
this, was crying excitedly : “He ought to be
fined! He ought to be fined! Look at my
mudguard. He ought to be fined !” Then
said the small, precise gentleman testily:
“But you don’t fine a dead man.” “Dead?”
cried George. “Dead? No, no! He cannot
be dead. It would upset everything—l am
giving a birthday party to-night.” Then the
supposed dead man sat up. The responsibility
was too great.
* * * *
“D. 0.”: It was pay-night in Melbourne,
and the tram on which I was occupying one-
third of a seat, half under a billowy female
with a basket of apples, was packed tight
fore and aft and all along the gangway. Sud-
denly a small man standing on my feet
turned to a long, lean youth beside him, and
said: “It’s no use, cobber, you can take
your duke out of that. I never carry any
valuables in my hip pocket.” The long, lean
young man made a ferocious reply as he
scrambled out and dropped off. The small
man turned a grinning face on the company.
“Bit of a jolt for his nibs, that, eh? I
always carry my week’s bit safe_ in an inside
pocket.” He showed us with an air
of pride. But the long, lean expert
had been less perfunctory than the small man
had imagined. There was a neat slit in the
vest, and the inside pocket was emptv!
*-* * *
“L.G.D.”: Apropos Port Harlequin and
its verdure (B. 30/3/22), one of the tough-
est shellbacks in Australia —call him Captain
Cuttle —told me a yarn about the selfsame
green vegetation, and how he made use of
it to feed a dozen or so sheep that he had
on board when he was in those parts
recently, and by so doing saved £lO.
When he reached Darwin he jibbed at hav-
ing to pay 50s. per bale for fodder, so he
gave his crew some bags, and told them
to fill them with the greenest grass they
could find. Sailors are very obedient when
it suits them, but Cuttle’s men first
demanded an advance (they got fl each)
before agreeing to hunt for emerald fodder.
Either the grass wasn’t green enough in the
streets, or it looked too much like ‘easy
money” (sailors love a spice of adventure
in the most prosaic undertakings) ; at all
events they jumped a fence where a livelier
emerald twinkled on the herbage, and set
about filling their sacks. They were soon lined
up by the owner with a gun. Explanations
followed during a journey to the police-
station. The sailors blamed the "old man,”
and said that he wouldn’t accept anything
but grass of the most iridescent green.
C.ptain Cuttle, having been sent for,
denied having incited his crew to trespass
upon private property, but admitted the
remarks as to the color. The owner saw
the humor of the situation, shouted for all
hands, and allowed the crew to fill the sacks
with his particular brand of Port Harlequin
vegetation, to the satisfaction of the sheep
and the benefit of the skipper’s pocket.

“Solomon Malaprop”: Great doings are to
be arranged in Sydney, the stronghold of
the Dooleys, McTiernans and McGirrs, when
the first ship carrying the Irish Free State
flag puts in an appearance. The date of
its arrival is uncertain, direct trade with
Ireland being small; but it is already men-
tioned that the Irish language will be ex-
clusively spoken on board. It is going to be
a queer old ship in that case, for Irish
isn’t a steamship language. A speech which
stopped growing when the harp was still
performing in Tara’s halls hasn’t kept pace
with modern invention: it would probably
require SO,OOO manufactured words added to
the existing 20,000 before one could drive
modern machinery with ‘it, and then it would
cease to be itself without becoming anything
else in particular. The world really has far
too many tongues on its mind, and instead
of trying to rescue any of them a reward
should be offered for production of the
corpse. A language in which anybody can
be backward, but in which no one can be
up to date, is rather a spook than a speech.
* * # *
“Croson”: One of the remarkable social
changes of the last few years has been the
gradual disappearance of Ah Sin from two
jobs which he once almost monopolised in
Melbourne. You wouldn’t find half-a-dozen
Chow market-gardeners now in Moorabbm,
Burwood, Spring Vale, Keysborough and the
country S.E. of the city, whence come nine-
ronths of the cabbages and caulies consumed.
Ah. Sin nowadays confines himself to
“bunched stuff,” and doesn’t produce an over-
whelming percentage of that. He isn’t
quite so near extinction as the laundryman;
but the Johns who still launder do so in
shops on the main thoroughfares, necessarily
with small accommodation, and any one of
the big steam laundries In Hawthorn, Kew;
S. Yarra, and Richmond handles more linen
than all the Sins put together.
“Hamer”: Another man with a broken
neck is now in Sydney Hospital with every
chance of complete recovery. As long as
the spinal cord is uninjured there is no
reason why the misplacing of the bone should
be fatal; but one thing seldom occurs with-

times in the history of Sydney Hospital,

unaffected by a decided kink in his neck.

Digger I know who might show something
better than this display of alphabet, refrains;
but he never signs a letter without adding:
“Late A.1.F.” Another man has notepaper
embossed with the actions in which he
fought. The best of them all, however, is
one whose letters occasionally come to me.
He insists upon holding his rank, although

each of his epistles I read in a large, bold
hand: “Augustus Swank. Lance-Corporal.

BUTTERFLIES AND BEES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“White butterflies!’’ he said, and kissed her hands.
Always he loved to see
Their whiteness flashing in the silken strands
Of some embroidery ;
To watch them hover over teacups frail,
Or turn the pictured pages of a tale
Of love and gallantry. :
“White butterflies for beauty, love,” he cried ;
“Oh, let them flutter always by my side
In happy coquetry!”
“Brown bees!” he said, and kissed her work-worn
hands;
And sighed the while to see
Their patient striving to unloose the bands
Of grief and poverty,
Sewing with roughened tips the endless seam,
Yet keeping still their hold upon the dream
Of life’s first ecstasy.
“Brown bees for sweetness, woman dear,” he cried ;
“God grant that I may keep them by my side
Through all eternity 1”

TOOHEY'S.
“Toby C.’s” tale of bush mateship:—
The other week word reached our camp that an
old hand was completely “on the outer” and re
duced to Government rations in the township. Going
into town that week-end I carried seven pound-notes
that had been put into my hands by seven toilers,
and, so far as I know, each man was unaware of
the other fellow’s gift. One grey-haired navvy
sidled up to me and said: “Give this quid to old
Scotty ; the poor old blank can do with it —and don’t
mention it to the others.” And that was typical
of the lot.
“Oamelero”: A chap in our battalion was
as game as they make ’em, and if there was
any dangerous work about, such as laying
barbed-wire near Abdul’s trenches, or carry-
ing ammunition up to the front line, he was
sure to get the job. Yet there came a day
when his pluck oozed out in a second, and
he crouched in the cook-house shivering and
whimpering. Our cook had stopped a sni-
per’s bullet the previous day, and the chap
who was afraid of nothing took on the job.
The cook-house was perched on the side of
Quinn’s Post, and after he had waved to
his. cobbers who were to relieve another bat-
talion in the trenches above, he started to
get things ready for dinner. Two hours
later, when he was attending to a tin of
stew on the fire, something lumbered past
him and fell into the fireplace. It was the
head of his dug-out mate. The dead man
had been detailed to occupy an observation-
post up above, and a dud shell from Abdul
had got him. There was a vacancy for an-
other cook that day.
Will Lawson hears of a ship’s soul:—
“You say a ship hasn’t got a soul!” an old shell-
back said to me the other day. “Well, I was on the
steamer Taupo when she struck a rock at Tauranga
Heads in ’79. She lay there two years; then they
raised her and lashed her to the AVellington with
four steel warps. It was 5 o’clock on a winter’s
day when the engines were rung ahead
and we pushed off for Auckland. Things went all
right till the evening, when the Taupo began to
leak. The pumps were started, but the water gained
and gained. I was standing by with an axe ready
to cut away. You could feel the Taupo leaning on
her sister, just as you might lean on me if you
were all in. At half-past eight we cast her off. It
seemed a dirty trick to play on a good ship, but
there you are-—what could we do? The salvage
crew was off, of course. The Taupo settled by the
stern, and she lifted her nose till she stood on end,
40ft. of her clear out of the water. Then her
THE HAD HEARD HER HIMSELF.
THE REAPER: “She oughtn’t to be singing,
you know. The doctor has strictly for-
bidden it.”
THE SMOKER : “Oh, does he live near her,
too?”
insides fell to bits —boilers collapsed or r-'mething,
by the crashing that went on below. But that was
nothing to the screams that came from her venti-
lators and hatches as she fell over on her beam-
ends with her funnel awash. It gave us the creeps
to hear them. Then all of a sudden she sank, and
as she went down there came the weirdest, most ter-
rible sound, like a shriek of a soul in torment; and
after that we in the AVellington were left standing—
mourners beside a grave. Some fellow with a heart
touched the whistle-cord—the living wishing the
HOPE DEFERRED.
“Horribly stiff luck of Enid’s; and after marrying the old beast, too!”
“Why, isn’t he as wealthy as she thought?”
“Oh, yes; but he’s quite ten years younger.”
dead good-bye. A ship got no soul, mister! I’ve
known different ever since that night off Tauranga,
when the Taupo died, 40 years ago.”
“616”: IJp at The Bluff in the Ypres
salient a Digger, while seated in the trench,
was fooling about with his rifle and shot
his pal through the leg. Next day, almost
at the same time, while the careless Bi'lljim
was with a fatigue party a short distance
behind the line, a Hun sniper got him in
practically the same spot as he had plugged
his mate. Both came home with right legs
amputated just below the knee.

“Pink Tape”: In Sydney the other day
an urgent call came to the Law to take over
a man who had broken into a large boarding-
house, and been
bailed up by a
couple of boarders.
When a pair of
breathless Hops
got there they
blundered into an
interesting domes-
tic scene. The
woman who owned
the boarding-house
had recognised in
the intruder her
husband whom she
had not seen for
20 years, and the
amazed man, to
whom the meeting
was equally unex-
pected, was accept-
i n g forgiveness
and promising to
take a job one of
the boarders said
he could get for
him. When the
Law asked where
it came in the wife
insisted that her husband had a perfect right
to be on the premises. It scratched its head
and left.

“McPud”: “Pall Mall” (B. 9/3/’22) com-
ments on the attitude of the Bench to the
sexual criminal of the Colin Ross type. Here
in Maoriland Boynton, P.M., recently waxed
vindictive, and awarded the noxious person
I-'t days for waylaying a tiny schoolgirl.
That same week I was asked to profession-
ally see two small girls, age 12 and 10. Four
years ago the younger had been offered a
ride to school on the bicycle of a passer-by,
the elder girl having refused. She accepted
and—never reached school. She was found
three days later in an isolated and deserted
cottage literally a wreck from fright and
the cruelty she had experienced. About a
month later, when the sister became infected,
an added horror was discovered by the
parents. A four-years’ struggle to free those
children from infection has so far failed, and
the ghoul that was the cause of it was never
caught. Could even a P.M. be insensible to
the horror of such a case? Fourteen days /
“Kismet”: Three times a week for two
years he has brought good bread to my house.
I didn’t know he was a returned soldier
till about three months ago; then I saw
him in the street in Sydney with his coat
on and caught sight of his badge. The only
complaint I had against him was the diffi-
culty I always had in getting my account.
I had to ask for it over and over again. Last
Saturday I got annoyed. “Really,”l groused,
“if you can’t bring my bread-bill every week
I’ll get another baker. Look how it mounts
up.” At that he made the longest speech
I had ever heard him make. “I don’t reckon
I ought to bring it at all,” he said. “Why
not?” “Well,” he replied, “it’s this way.
The Captain saved my life.” “What Cap-
tain?” “Captain L , your husband. He
brought me in under fire when I got it in
the leg. No, I don’t suppose you ever heard
of it—he wasn’t that kind. But well.
now you see how it is”—and he fled. I
think I know why.

“Heredot”: There is one man who was
shanghaied at Newcastle (N.S.W.) in the
bad old days and does not curse his luck.
About 30 years ago he was one,of the gay
young sparks of Coalopolis with money and
influence in plenty. Then he met with an
accident, the effects of which were painful,
and his doctor administered fairly large
doses of morphine. He recovered from the
mishap, but he had contracted the morphine
habit, and in a few months was a pitiable
wreck. _ His people had given up all hope
of reclaiming him, when one night he mys-
teriously. disappeared. What happened was
that while walking by himself in a New-
castle slum he was knocked out—and recov-
ered consciousness in the forecastle of a
sailing-ship bound for South America, signed
on as an A.B. bv the runners of a notorious
shanghai boardinghouse-keeper. There was
no morphine'on board, and as his need for
it grew he must have suffered a little hell.
Finally, a crisis was reached, when he col-
lapsed and became semi-unconscious. The
sailors looked after him as well as they
could while he lav in this state for two days:
then his senses slowly returned, and he found
his need for the drug grow less and less,
until at last it passed away altogether

“Clifford Snook” meets Doreen:—
I came across the Sentimental Bloke and Doreen
awaiting the tram outside the pub at Bondi Beach.
Relations all the relations in sight, anyhow—were
strained when I arrived, and they didn’t improve
with the flight of time. The Bloke was a kindly,
troubled weed with a cigarette. Doreen was flushed
and plump and pouting, and just leaving her flapper-
hood behind her. She broke the dead silence by
saying “Sbuttup” with blood-curdling bitterness. The
Bloke remained shut. She said “Get out. I’m sick
of you.’’ The Bloke got partly out, and shambled
20yds. along the pavement. With brooding eyes fixed
on her shoes Doreen was oblivious to his absence
and said again “Shurrup.” Presently, recognising
him on the return trip, she cried like Rachel weep-
ing in Hebrew for her children: “You an’ that girl
upstairs! ” The Bloke spread out his hands and
opened his mouth in protest, but melted away again
when Doreen cried in fury: “Shurrrrrupppp. Go an’
drown yourself.” He seemed a decent sort of Blake

who deserved a milder Doreen. She brooded and
lie blew this way and that till the ear came along.
On the step she made a motion to brain him with
her flabby bag and bade him patronise the other end
of the vehicle. Recognising the inevitable separa-
tion, the Bloke put her fare into her hand before
she realised what was happening. She looked at the
coppers as if the unbelievable had happened, and
with a smothered noise out of her heaving bust
threw them into the road. An almost petrified Bloke
woke from a stupor just in time to seize on the
tail-end of the lumbering vehicle. But there was
no formal rupture of the engagement that I heard,
and Doreen was still wearing her ring when I last
saw her.
A NEW CRAZE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Faculty’s hit on a new disease
That fills us with consternation.
They’ve done with the good old-fashioned ills;
It isn’t the faulty valve that kills,
In spite of potion, powder and pills—
It’s “auricular fibrillation” !
The doctor expounds the dire complaint:
You take in the situation.
The out-of-date fatty heart’s gone bung,
Its end was peace, its requiem’s sung;
“Mitral incompetence,” “trumpeter’s lung”—
They’re only imagination!
Now if you should wish to be in the swim,
Don’t talk about palpitation ;
Just say that your doctor has told you straight
That you are reserved for a lordlier fate,
A kind of a sort of an unknown state
Called “auricular fibrillation” !

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“Lyndhurst”: One way to keep ants from
a suspended safe is to hang it by a hobble-chain.
For some mysterious reason the rings get them
bothered. They may negotiate two, but the third
one generally boxes them altogether. I have seen
the big meat-ants run round and round the rings
trying to get past the swivel, but have never known
them to succeed.
* * * *
“O. Ren”: Recent references to wells
caving in remind me of the luck of a couple of
delvers when the bottom fell out of a pit in the Mt.
Gambier (S.A.) railway yard. The village rests on
a crust of earth about 60ft. thick, a fact that the
diggers evidently forgot, for they carried the well
right down until the bottom suddenly collapsed. A
hanging rope saved good lives, but all the tools were
lost.
» • • »
“Morob”: The New Guinea native can get
a move on sometimes. Some
years ago in the Eitape dis-
trict a white man was badly
mauled by a crocodile, and
one of his “boys” carried
the news into Eitape, 35
miles away, in six hours.
And it was far from smooth
country that he traversed.
There happened to be a doc-
tor at the settlement, arid it
Was decided to take him to
the patient in a whale-boat.
A crew of picked native
police was got together, and
on the position being ex-
plained the nigs undertook
to establish a new world’s
record. They must have
come pretty close to doing it.
The distance was a shade
under 40 miles by sea, and
they covered it in almost
exactly four hours. There
were eight in the crew', and
they took the oars four at a
time, in shifts of half an
hour, changing over two by
two so that no time would
be lost by stopping. When
they reached their destina-
tion they u'ere all bleeding
from mouth and nose, and
every one collapsed. Yet in
a few hours they had all re-
covered, and the next day
rowed the boat back, though
more leisurely. Incidentally,
the crocodile’s victim died a
little later from shock; but
those boys had certainly done
their darnedest to give him a chance.
"Kahbionba”: The “Australian pine”
{Casuarina equisetifolia), which “Frank White” (B.
23/2/ 22) inquires about from U.S.A., is really much
more akin to pines than to the beeches (with which,
indeed, it has no more relation than to the beets), it
being a true conifer. It has, however, a much wider
natural habitat than Australia, being indigenous to
E. Africa, Southern Asia and Polynesia, besides our
continent. It deserves all the praise that “Frank
White” gives it, and, I hope, will yet meet an equal
recognition here.
* * # #
“Paul”: Would you call this a warning,
or was. it his fate to be struck dead ? A man was
standing between two horses at the stable, when one
of the horses was killed by lightning, the second
horse and the man being unhurt. He got another horse
and set off, riding one and leading the other. The
led horse was killed by lightning. The man still
rode on. In half-an-hour he and the horse he was
riding lay dead on the road, struck by lightning.
“Golub” gets reinforcements :
I’ve forgotten the name of the fiercely-patriotic
gentleman who tackled me for saying that Australia
had no venomous snakes to compare with those of
other countries in point of deadliness; but here is
some information for which the Indian Government
vouches. In 10 years, 1910-20, the average annual
number of deaths from cobra bites was 3000. Less
than five per cent, of those bitten recovered, even
when the latest methods of treatment were available.
In Brazil the yearly average of deaths was just on
1000. One State alone —Sao Paulo —had 300 fatal
cases during each year, while the percentage of
BALANCE.
LADY: “ You give me short weight for my money, butcher."
BUTCHER: "Well, you see, ma'am, you give me such a long wait for mine."
recoveries was even less than in India. In Texas,
rattlesnakes, which are practically the only dangerous
reptiles found there, accounted for 170 deaths on
an average every 12 months, and in Florida the
moccasin-snake killed 120 during the same period,
although a far greater number were bitten and
recovered in each State. I don’t know if any statis-
tics as to the number of persons bitten and killed
by the three most venomous Australian varieties—
the black, the tiger and the death-adder —have ever
been collected; but if they were, the percentage of
recoveries would prove to be far greater than the
percentage of deaths. And have there been half-a-
dozen deaths from snakebite in the whole Common-
wealth during any recent year?
“Yantabanjee”: A mate of mine a few
weeks ago came across a brown snake in the act of
getting out of his old skin. First he bit a hole in
the old skin about six inches behind the head, then
he drew his fore-part out of the hole by doubling
back, the old skin of the head being turned inside
out. Once the head was out he set about working his
body Clear. The skin was gradually peeled inside
out, the tail being the last to quit. Time taken,
about an hour.
*■«•■*•*
“Holy Dan”: What is the greatest area
of land turned' up by one plough in a day? In the
Peak Hill (N.S.W.) district in 1913 I saw an oil
tractor pulling five five-furrow McKay disc ploughs
turn over to a depth of five inches 334 acres in a
non-stop run of eight hours. This was in an exhibi-
tion test and was witnessed by many farmers.
“R.A.G.”: Re “Orney’s” snake-eating
trout (B. 9/3/122). About two years ago a 201 b.
cod was caught near Waikerie (S.A.), and when it
was being cleaned a 4ft. brown snake wriggled out
and bit the astonished fisherman on the hand.
“Gouger” : The male crocodile has among
his many other low habits, a hefty taste for canni-
balism. In N.Q. rivers I have often seen, when the
waters get low and the fish scarce, the sand beaches
thickly lined with baby crocodiles, while cruising
along the water’s edge were the ma. crocs., keeping
a watchful eye on the old men who were gazing
hungrily on their offspring. Every now and again
an old chap would make a dinnyhazer rush to try
to break through the cordon, but the females would
turn on him with teeth, claws and lashing tails. A
good way to exterminate these fish-destroyers would
be to shoot as many females as possible and let the
males live to complete the job—a sort of variation
of the Rodier rabbit-destruction idea.
“.Tim Carew”: Some tribes of Centralian
Binghis have a method of disposing of the bodies of
their dead youngsters that I have never heard of
elsewhere. The corpse is tightly wrapped in strips
of bark, placed in a hollow tree and left there to
dry. In four or five months the tribe returns and
all the bodies are gathered and cremated in a big
fire. When the fire has died down the gins collect
the ashes from near where their children were burnt
and carry them round, sometimes for years, in their
dilly-bags. While the actual burning is going on
the gins sit close round the fire and keep up a
prolonged wailing; but the men stay right outside
the light of the fire and take no part in the pro-
ceedings.
“Six-and-Eight” (one of 68) : Tell “Jim
Carew” (B. 9/3/’22) that a “cobbler” is a wrinkly
sheep whose fleece is full of dust, burrs and grass-
seed, and on that account hard to shear. In the
old sheds a number of shearers caught from the
same pen of unshorn sheep, and naturally each man
chose the easiest he could see. Thus the last sheep
left, before a fresh yarding was penned, was the
wrinkliest, burliest, grass-seediest in the mob.
He was called the cobbler because he stuck to the
last. The term is now used in a slightly different
sense, for under modern conditions each shearer has
his own pen to catch from. It is now applied to
any hard-to-shear sheep, and the growl “Jim Carew”
heard is a common one in sheds, for every shearer
seems to think the penner-up shoves all the hard
sheep on to him.
“Bill R.”: Like “Fraoch” (B. 9/3/’22),
I’m convinced snakes hare mesmeric powers. At
“The Manse,” near the Bombala River (N.S.W.), I
heard wild wailing from a rabbit in the scrub, and,
investigating, I found a large brown snake with his
body half-raised from the ground slowly waving his
head to and fro. A few feet in front the bunny,
emitting terrorised squeals, was prancing from side
to side, its movements in unison with those of .the
wriggler. With every side-step the hypnotised
rabbit got nearer, though to all appearances
it was struggling desperately to keep back. I
entered into the joke with a sapling, and my first
bash broke the spell that held the furry fellow. He
bolted for cover while I continued the argument
with his tormentor.
THE FA TALIST.
"'Tain't no damn use trying to dodge
trouble—if it's going to get yer it will
get yer!"
“Milang”: Where did “Old Hughie” come
from? Every bush boy and nigger knows him. But
no one I’ve met knows how the name originated.
Yet at the end of the dry, when the first ftw
showers fall, “Send it down, Hughie!” is the heart-
felt exclamation of every eager bush-watcher.

Now in my little pigeon-box are rows of new pine
shelves,
And over rolls of manuscript thoughts steeplechase
like elves;
The boards are mortised neat and trim, and level
from the plane
They breathe of yellow summer sun, the sweet of
summer rain;
Shaped from a splendid trunk of pine that footed
some far hill,
To sink beneath a ringing axe, and, carried to the
mill
By creaking waggon through the scrub, by ploughed
land rough and brown,
Yielding its might in length of board and sawdust
drifting down,
They speak of taut and whirling belts, the engine’s
chuff and smoke,
Of the far ranks of brother trees the axe’s echoes
woke.
The leaves my pine-tree held have known the pipe
of many a bird,
The honey-weighed September breeze amid the twigs
has stirred;
Beneath its shade the kangaroo has paused to wind
the foe.
The bronze-wing in -the springy branch has flitted
to and fro;
And when the cloak of twilight fell and stars pricked
small and pale,
The Hunted Man has doubled here to bluff the
troopers’ trail.
The snake has slid among the grass, the rosy-footed
dove
Has crooned its gentle nesting song, all threaded
through with love.
Now hands have dipt the green away and left me
only wood
AN OLD FRIEND.
“Thee ’ve ’ad that old pipe some brave long
spell, judgin' by smell av un, mate?"
“More'n twenty years, and I aren't 'ad more
'n about four new stems and three new
bowls for un.”
For lines severe of office shelves. But, ah, their
smell is good!
It keeps the crush of baby leaves, the dry clean
whiff of bark,
Some memory of thin star-rays that reached it
through the dark; ..
The grain that gives the toll of years until the
wise eye sees
How many are the girdling rings with which Time
weds the trees;
The messages of seeding grass, the brush of butter-
flies,
The dawn awake with whirring wings, the night
with watchful eyes!
The joiner shook his head at pine, for pine, he
said, was “high.”
Ay, high enough to find, in storm, blue islands
of the sky,
When the great winds come down from God and
rock the resined twig.
So pine, I said, my shelves must be. although the
price was big.
He did not know-, the carpenter, half of the things
I sought;
I do not think he ever knew half of the things I
bought—
The lullabies in swaying boughs that bear the
shining leaf,
The moon between cloud-stooks of Heaven, the stars
in golden sheaf,
The feather from the grey goose-wing the pine-
branch trapped for me,
The mountains that it conjured up, the sapphires
of the sea,
The moss that makes the fairies’ beds, the pillow in
the fern,
The curtains that the spider spun; what joiner
could discern
The many things a poet buys when ordering office
shelves
Whose boards are full of waving boughs, whose
pigeon-holes of elves !
Some grave accountant might have placed his books
in ordered rows,
With files of bills all docketed that careful souls
dispose,
And left no niche for coat of green and goblin cap
of red—
Well, only then I think my tree would have been
truly dead !

“C. Coral” on a fishy business: —
“Bouragi” some time back identified the Torres
Strait fish-traps mentioned by me with the bamboo
palisade arrangements used by the Papuans. But
the Torres Strait fish weir is quite a different kind
of thing and is found practically only in the islands
of the eastern group. Actually the traps are stone
fences; some are semi-circular, some rectangular
and others follow fantastic designs. A series runs
round Murray, Darnley and Stephen islands, each
trap being anything from a couple of hundred yards
to half-a-mile across. Their origin is a mystery.
Present-day natives disavow all knowledge of their
construction, and attribute them to supernatural
origin—“spirit he make him.” A local legend
assigns their creation to two mythical beings from
other waters, who, in addition, changed the language
of the people and introduced new words and customs.
The traps, which are kept in repair and are still in
use, are capable of holding anything up to a small
dugong. When I said that possibly they may be a
link with old-time Spanish or Peruvian visitors I
thought it quite possible that casta I ways from some
ship that had come to grief might exercise sufficient
influence to get such work carried out. I have my-
self seen what has been done on one of these islands
by only one European (a fugitive from an American
ship in the early years of last century). I quite
agree with “Bouragi” that not all the junk in this
corner of Davy Jones’s locker is Spanish sti ff by any
means; but, all the same, there are, undoubted old
wrecks lying about which once flew the flag of Spain.
Rock-drawings from the New Guinea coast right
down as far as Sydney indicate that the Spaniards
dallied awhile on other jaunts. According to carto-
graphical documents Spanish and Portuguese adven-
turers were knocking round Australia’s coasts early
in the 16th century, even before Torres spotted the
straits. Others came later, and several of their
AN ACQUIRED TASTE.
“Old Cowman's come a cropper over his
daughter.”
“How’s that?”
“Used to take ’er rides on the reaper and
binder, and now she’s sloped with a
bloke in a Ford.”
high-pooped hookers were posted missing. It is
reasonable to suppose that the reefs which gripped
so many others in modern times got them as well.
An official of the British Museum is alleged to have
deciphered an ancient cartographical document giving
particulars of a Spanish-I'eruvian expedition to these
waters early in the 16th century. It is stated that
one of its treasure-laden ships was left up Cape York
way, and that the position shown on the chart corres-
ponds as nearly as possible with that of the old
wreck from which specie was dug out some 20 years
or so ago.

“Billy Cann”: Will some Abo. oblige with
a method of eliminating magnesium from boiler-
feed water; also a simple test for salt in same ?
Silver nitrate gives the water a decided milky ap-
pearance ; well-water is the only liquid available.
Could the mag. be neutralised? It is the very
devil on tubes, through pitting. Perhaps it might
help if I added that I was in the Demolition party
at the Evacuation, and am now, after a hard struggle,
trying to make a do of a sawmill. But the feed-
water problem has got me beaten.
“E.S.S.”: Many Australian birds prac-
tise some kind of deceit to put you off the track to
their nests, but the strategy of the black swan differs
from all others. One built its bulky nest in a small
patch of reeds in our home swamp, and whenever
Mrs. Swan saw me coming that way she slipped
stealthily from the shallow cavity and swam away
HALF-RIGHT. ANYWAY.
“Anything to say?”
“Gimme a chance, yer Warship; I’m down and out.”
“You’re down all right, but you won’t be out for six months."
with her head and neck stretched out on a level with
the water till she had placed a considerable distance
between herself and the nest. Then she would turn
about, looking quite innocent, and swim a little way
towards me with her head proudly erect. Her move-
ments and manner were eloquent. “If you’re looking
for my nest,” she lied, “it's over this way.”
“A.Z.”: “Te W.” (B. 2/3/’22) is a long
way out when he says that certain seafowl, lyre-
birds and the nightjars are the only Australian birds
that lay but one egg. Surely he has heard of the
bronze cuckoo, which never lays more than one egg in
a nest. The bustard, also, lays only a single, though
there are often two eggs, in a nest, owing to two
birds using the one depository.
* * * *
“Jobber”: If “Bootes” (B. 9/3/’22) gets
a kangaroo-skin and belts his sheep-dog with it, I
think the mong. will attend strictly to business and
leave kangaroos alone ever after.
* * * *
“Steve Hart”: have frequently seen the
small fish mentioned by “Wilga” in far-western
N.S.W. bore drains; and, despite “Barcoo” (B.
9/3/’22), I have found them right at the bore-head,
where the water is hot enough to make tea or cook
meat. Those at the bore-head are mostly eyeless,
and bore inspectors out there aver they come up
from below.
* * * *
“Arencie”: Bill and Jim were the only
occupants of the hut, and Jim complained of sleep-
lessness. Bill opined that the best cure was “count-
ing sheep going through a gate.” Jim tried it
and then, after a long interval of silence, decided
it was time, for a round-table conference. “Bill,”
he said, “what do you do when you’ve got a million
sheep in the paddock?” “Draft ’em out and see
if yer tally’s right-o,” came in a sleepy voice from
Bill’s bunk.
“Atrocity”: What is the correct incision
to make in case of snakebite ? I have seen some
terrible mutilations, and the last case under notice
spent three weeks in hospital owing to the too-free
use of a razor on the back of the hand.
“Barnacle”: If anglers carefully watched
when catching sharks they’d probably notice that,
though the little chaps often do get out of the wet
into the safety of their mum’s tummy, the old lady
does not swallow them.
* * * *
“Cy Cyclone”: A married couple on one
of the phosphate islands recently resolved to keep
fowls, and they commissioned the Chinese chief
steward of the first Melbourne-bound ship to pur-
chase the poultry for them. A month later the boat
arrived back at the island, and the Chink proudly
presented the fruit of his negotiation—one astonished
hen and nine roosters.
“Veronal”: Turpentine seems to be a
pretty effective cure for centipede bite. A woman
bitten on the leg says she rubbed the part with
common turps for about 10 minutes, which removed
both the swelling and the inflammation. By morning
only a couple of red spots were left. Yet some
persons, bitten by Manv-legs, suffer severely and
have to seek medical aid. Turps is Al, too, for
bush tick. I have had three of the beasts in my
head at once, but after giving each a drop or two
of turpentine they fell out, and no ill-effects followed.
Turps not only kills the tick but is highly anti-
septic.
“Don Quill”: Can anyone classify this
snake, killed at Normanton (N.Q.) ? Length, Oft.
21in.; color, similar to that of a tree-snake; tail,
tapering to a needle-point about 12in. long; head,
flat and diamond-shaped. The reptile is poisonous,
as I had great difficulty in saving my dog, who was
bitten by it.
“Wild Oat”: I can confirm “Exul’s” pat
(B. 16/3/’22) about the poisonous red-back spider.
In 1911 I was bitten on the toe by one and barely
got to a doctor, a mile away, owing to my leg
going stiff. It cost me 10 days’ pay. A year before
this one Ainsworth, of Narrandera (N.S.W.), was
bitten on the face and died.
**. . * *
“Eddyson”: Carne was cutting firewood
in Aber’s back paddock, and the day registered up
to ISOdeg. in the sun: The woodman had felled a
big tree and lopped off the branches, and now he
was swinging the stub-nosed crosscut as though it
was a winter’s day. The sundowner came up from
the creek, where he had been sitting with his feet
in the water. “Day, mate,” said he. He seated
himself astride the butt, well in the shade, and
groaned. “A nell iv a day,” said he. Carne threw
the sweat from his hair, and agreed. “’Tis a hot
day, now you mention it.”
“Never struck a worser,” said
the stranger; “ ’tain’t wuth
while bein’ alive weather like
this.” He sighed heavily and
lay back on the log. “Got
anythin’ to drink?” Carne
indicated the big billy half-
full of cold tea. “Might ’and
us it, mate,” said the sun-
downer. Carne passed the
billy, and the unbidden guest
helped himself to the fill
of three lids. Then he
groaned again, and said,
“Takes the sap outer yer,
don!t it?” Carne continued
swinging his crosscut, but
admitted the debilitating
effect of the abnormal condi-
tions. The stranger helped
himself to the . woodcutter’s
tobacco, lit up, and sighed
heavily. He said he “s’posed
’twas two ’underd in the
shade about.” He wiped his
brow on his arm. Carne
sighed and ceased work.
“Can feel the marrer iv me
spine meltin’ away,” said the
sundowner. Carne sat with
his back to the log, finished
the tea and lit his pipe. The
sundowner sighed and groaned.
Carne groaned. The sun-
downer sagged hopelessly and
let his arms drop. “Wisht I
had a bar’l iv lager,” he said
—“iced.” Carne uttered a
passionate word, then sprang
up, seized the sundowner, ran

him 20 yards, precipitated
him down the creek bank and hurled the pessimist’s
swag after him. Then he took to his saw again
with teriffic energy. “Remindin’ a feller!” he com-
plained.
*** • #
“Pick”: Re “Bootes’s” sheep-dog (B.
9/3/’22) that forsakes duty to chase kangaroos. A
plan that works wonders with a quail dog who
develops the habit of racing after flushed birds is to
fasten a strong fishing-line to his collar. When he
sets off in pursuit he is allowed to run the length
of the line, then his boss whistles and simultaneously
the dog is jerked wrong-end uppermost. A few sur-
prises like that and he will throw somersaults in
his haste to get back when the whistle reaches him.
“Billy T.”: Funny was the best snake-dog
I have ever known. He was a sturdily-built terrier
in a mat of hair that was an effective armor. On
discovering a snake, he never obtruded himself, but
worked for a point from which to attack ; then, like
a flash, he sprang in and never failed to collar the
viper just below the head, leaving the quarry no
room to turn. He hung on till it was safe to let go.
The tenacity he displayed proved how well he
realised the danger. One day we were disturled by
sounds of a violent dog-fight just outside the tent.
Pond’s Dark and our dog were at it, and to our aston-
ishment Funny was being badly tumbled about. We
froze Dark off, and then perceived the reason of
Funny's ineffectiveness. He had a small black snake
by the nape, and had allowed the nefarious and
unenlightened Dark to get in his good work rather
than let go that snake while he might still have a
bite about him.
* * * *
“The Rumpus” : I can’t see the stingaree’s
“smart contraction and expansion of its muscles”
in order to stick its bayonet in as suggested by
“Te Whare” (B. 2/2/’22). The ’ree swings his long
whip around your leg, then brings the base around
and drives the spike home. It is impossible to take
hold of the beast because of his slimy flaps. Your
best hope is that a doctor doesn’t live too far away.
I have caught thousands along the Queensland coast,
and have seen spikes up to Bin. long.
* * * *
“Tlieo D. Lite” complained (B. 9/3/’22)
that the brim of his felt hat lost its stiffness. Here
are a few of the battalion that charged to his
rescue•
“Pom-Dig”: Just run a hot iron around the brim.
If “Theo” hasn’t got the orthodox iron, any old
makeshift will do. Failing this, let him tack a strip
of galvanised-iron around the blame thing.
“G.S.C.”: Save the gall next time a sheep is
killed; then lay the tile flat on a box, squirt the
gall all around the brim and rub it in with a stick.
Let it dry in the shade. If it is not stiff after the
first application the second will do the trick.
“W.W.”: Put syrup on the brim, leave it for
two or three hours, then wash it off the surface.
The resultant stiffness will last three or four
months.
“Bluey”: Dissolve one dessert-spoonful of sugar
in half a cup .of hot water, and rub it well in both
sides of the brim with a brush —an old toothbrush
does very well. Then put the hat on a flat surface
and place weights all round on the brim to keep it
straight. Leave it like this till dry, but not in the
sun, though the sun will have no effect on it when
it is dry. If “Theo” does the job properly he’ll have
a brim stiff enough for the kids to dance on. It
won’t last for ever, but the process can be repeated
when necessary.
“Banjo Billy”: Punch small holes close together
round the outside edge and thread them with a
bootlace; then you can stiffen or loosen the brim
at will by pulling or slackening the lace.
“Alex”: When my hats suffered from chronic
“flops” I got two. rusty hatpins, threaded them
through the brim, edge to crown, and jabbed a thin
layer of cork on the points. One each side of my
lid made it stiffer’n a corpse.
“Jobber”: “L.J.D.” (B. 9/3/’22) is talk-
ing through his hat when he says his Singleton
cobber milks 50 cows twice a day on his Pat
Malone. No. man can milk as fast as the fastest
woman at the game, and the fastest woman would
take at least five hours to put through 50.
THE BOOZE WAS INCIDENTAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tim Ryley had confessed to me
He had no love of liquor.
“I’d take to opium first,” said he —
“It’s surer and much quicker.
There’s nothing to my way of thinkin’
In this ridic’lous game of drinkin’.”
Then Mrs. Oddy bought the pub
At Claypipe, on the Crescent.
The place became a kind of club,
Home-like and very pleasant.
For Tim this dimpled Mrs. Oddy
Was an attractive little body.
I met him coming from the inn.
His eyes were bleared and blinking—
In fact, he was as tight as sin.
Said I: “Old man, you’re drinking!”
Then Ryley flashed his quaint retort in:
“Not dthrinkin’,” said he, “merely courtin’.”

Motorists all know what this means: A
pleasant outing, no mechanical troubles, no
roadside delays for tyre repairs. Many enjoy
this experience month after month, others
always appear to be in trouble—and in most
instances they have only themselves to blame.
It does not matter what the car is, nor how
much it cost; constant care and attention
are essential to the “good run” habit. Again,
what an important part the tyres play in
this connection. Some motorists are very
careless as regards the tyres they use, and
thus have an unsatisfactory experience.
WITH DEPENDABLE “RAILROAD”
lop ty:
fitted, one can be sure of many months of
pleasant motoring, free of tyre troubles. All
you have to do is to see that they are kept
properly inflated, and it is amazing how the
thousands of miles add up before your
“Railroads” show any material signs of wear.
They do not chip or cut, their fine quality
withstanding the hardest driving; and as re-
gards value—they have no equal. The day you
fit “Railroads” you ensure tyre satisfaction and
economy, and at a lower initial cost than any
imported tyre. Why not enjoy “Railroad”
service? Obtainable at leading garages.

The Methods of a Model
J HE model seated herself on the dais.
She was not a young woman, but
there was a strange beauty in her
pale face with its clouds of dark-brown hair.
I went over and arranged her draperies.
“Do you mind if I take your hair down?”
I asked. “I want to do it up in a particular
way.” She nodded, and I pulled out the
pins. I was astonished at the flood of soft
hair they released.
“What wonderful hair!” I exclaimed.
“You must let me paint you some day with
your hair down” I buried my hands in
the thick, silky masses of it. “I know some
girls who would give a small fortune to have
Imir like that.”
She only smiled rather sadly. I knew
there had been much trouble in her life.
As I painted I encouraged her to talk. At
last my own curiosity overcame me, and I
asked what she did to make her hair so glori-
ous.
“Mine is always coming out,” I told her.
“I suppose I should have it cropped as most
women-artists do.”
“I’ve never been in a hairdresser’s shop
in my life,” she said. “I’ve only used one
or two old-fashioned recipes which I make
up myself. I always shampoo with stallax.
I find you only need about a tablespoonful
to cleanse one’s hair thoroughly, and so it
does not work out at all expensive in the end.
Once I tried something else, but m.v hair
did not dry all soft and bright as it does
after stallax. so I returned to the old recipe.
If it shows any tendency to fall out, I obtain
some boranium from the chemist, and mix
it With a little bay rum; that soon makes
it grow thick and strong again. Perhaps
you wonder why at my age—I’m fifty, you
know —I haven’t grey hair? Once it did
I begin to look faded and streaky, but someone
told me that the only real way to restore
the color was by dissolving some pure tam-
malite in bay rum and applying this lotion
to the hair each day. It’s wonderful stuff,
but people so seldom think of using any-
thing so simple, do they?”
“They don’t, indeed,” I answered, “but
you’ve opened my eyes. You must write it
all down, if you will be so kind. And now
shall we rest? You must be tired.”
As she nodded her head gratefully the
sun flashed on her head and brought out
unsuspected golden lights in that wonderful
hair.
After a brief interval she resumed the
pose. As I re-adjusted her head I noticed
the extraordinarily beautiful texture of her
skin. What claims she had to beauty, I
1 reflected, were due to the wonderful perfec-
! tion of detail —she bore the closest scrutiny.
I lingered longer than was necessary over
the arrangement of her head in order to
| admire the clear, fine tone of her skin. He"
complexion was almost colorless, but the
skin showed hardly a crease; the lips, I
noticed, looked warm and healthy, and her
eyelashes gave her rather pale eyes a
shadowy beauty. Feature for feature, she
was not pretty, but there was a charm about
her that grew on one, and no one could deny
the loveliness of her soft hair and satiny
skin.
As I painted everything feminine in me
wanted to ask her if she had any secrets for
keeping that wonderful skin, but politeness
forbade. To my joy, however, she resumed
our former conversation.
“It always seems to me that old-fashioned
remedies are the best. Of course, I have to
consider the question of keeping such looks
j as I may have, because being a model is
, precarious work, and the market is over-
j stocked with old models of the wrinkled
white-haired type. I always treat my skin
rather carefully because I look on it as busi-
ness capital. Every night I massage it with
pure mercolised wax, which I wash off in
the morning with warm water. That clears
the skin thoroughly, because the oxygen in
the wax absorbs all the waste outer tissue
of the skin, and exposes the new complexion
underneath, which is quite fresh and smooth.
Of course, this treatment is a great pre-
ventive of wrinkles, for they never have
time to form.
I have taken to using something for my
lips lately, as they used to be so dry and
sore. I bought an ordinary stick of prolac-
tum, and I do not think you could find any-
thing better. It is so soothing, and it gives
one’s lips just a nice warm healthy look,
without any hint of make-up.
“I am very interested in all you have told
me,” I answered. “I wish I could tell you
some things, too. But I don’t believe there
is any little secret you don’t know.”
i “I - have not yet found anything really
good for the hands,” she told me, holding out
a pair of shapely but roughened ones; “house-
I work makes them so red and dirty!”
j “Ah! I exclaimed, “then I can give you
one tip. Get some bicrolium jelly from your
chemist; you’ll find that it will get all the
ingrained dirt right out of your hands, be-
sides making them beautifully soft and white.
I don’t know where I should be without it
myself.”
She thanked me very sincerely, and the
time being up, prepared to go.—Advt.

The Public of the Last Thirty Years
The novel “with a purpose” belongs not
to to-day, as we sometimes think, nor to 30
years ago, but to the period from 1840 to
1870. Take the most vital question of the
present hour —the relation of labor and capi-
tal to life and society. In 1848 Charles
Kingsley published “Yeast,” and in 1850 fol-
lowed it with “Alton Locke.” As pure fic-
tion neither book can take very high rank,
though either is better than any novel pub-
lished in the last five years; but as thought-
ful studies of the rural and city aspects of
labor they are still without rivals. No one
else under the guise of fiction has said any-
thing like as much on the subject or found
anything like such a public. In 1839
Dickens published “Nicholas Nickleby,” and
in 1847' Charlotte Bronte followed with
“Jane Eyre,” both aiming at the reform
of the public attitude towards education.
Before 1840 Thackeray had published “Cath-
erine”—a direct attempt to reform the novel,
which was then falling into evil ways be-
cause of its habit of chasing a public. In
1855 Mrs. Gaskell tackled the problem of
industrial strikes in “North and South,” a
rather loosely-written novel of the most
thoughtful kind, which enabled readers to
see for the first time both sides of the pic-
ture. Half the work of Charles Reade was
directly didactic and crowded with practical
thought on practical problems. It is only
necessary to mention “It is Never Too Late
to Mend,” “Hard Cash” and “Foul Play”
to show how wide was his field of endeavor.
All these and a thousand other books pub-
lished in the period aimed at the direct
cleaning up of England by stirring the people
to thought about matters in their own back
yards or front gardens. They used fiction
as a lever and not always wisely.
In the greater fields of human relation-
ship, sex morality, interplay of character
and philosophy of life, who can possibly
be blind to the work done more than 30
years ago? The chief fault of the fiction
of that time is that it dwells at too great
length on such matters, and fails to get on
with its story. It is where story and at-
tempted teaching are properly blended that
a book has succeeded best in holding the
attention of the succeeding age. Does any-
one seriously imagine that “Vanity Fair.”
“A Tale of Two Cities,” “Cranford,”
“Adam Bede,” “Withering Heights,”
“Kenelm Chillingly.” “The Cloister and the
Hearth,” “The Egoist” and “For the Term
of His Natural Life” were merely “fillers of
the evening hour, the idle moment”? Or
that the novelists of the last 30 years have
shown more thought and purpose? Let
us try a test. There are novelists writing
to-day who were writing 30 years ago, and
perhaps the most notable of them is Hall
Caine. These are the books he published
more than 30 years ago: “The Shadow of a
Crime,” “A Son of Hagar,” “The Deemster,”
“The Bondman” and “The Scapegoat.”
Since then he has written “The Manxman,”
“The Christian,” “The Eternal City,” “The
Prodigal Son,” “The White Prophet,” “The
Woman Thou Gavest Me” and other rub-
bish. Everything he produced more than
30 years ago has some honest thought, some
effort after real literary value; then he
started out to chase the public, and all other
endeavor was cast away.
It is no use of making a pretence that the
public of to-day demands thought, asks for
the elucidation of problems or calls for some-
thing better than that which satisfied the
past. Every new best-seller shouts the lie
to such a theory. The dominant influences
in fiction for the last 30 years have been
such writers as Marie Corelli. Elinor Glyn,
Ethel M. Dell and Nat Gould —particularly
Nat Gould. These are the writers who
have found the public. In the period just
before the dawn of this period the equivalent
section of readers followed with breathless
interest W T ilkie Collins, “Ouida,” Besant and
Rice, Miss Braddon, Hawley Smart and Mrs.
Henry Wood. It has been a very unfor-
tunate 30 years that wc have just passed
through.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Jack London
Though Jack London alive loved his wife,
he must chide her in death. She has written
the story of his life, but it is a “Life” that
we would expect some love-lorn maiden to
have made about her fiance, struck off on
the night of their betrothal. It is a sloppy
love-letter. She gushes through 800 pages.
“After it all, and it all, and it all, here
we are. all in all, all in all. Sometimes I just
want to get up on top of Sonoma Mountain
and shout to the world about you and me.
Arms ever around and around”—there are
hundreds of letters like that. Jack, the
Prince of the Oyster Pirates, sailor, vagrant,
the follower of 20 occupations; Jack who
dashed to the Yukon for sheer love of ad-
venture and who could “mix it” with the
best: Jack the red-blooded, broad-shouldered
—this man was a prairie wolf. Mrs. Lon-
don has made him a lapdog.
But amid the sticky pages we find uow
and then a glimpse of the real man. Such
is the description of the fight on board the
Sophie Sutherland between Jack, a mere
boy, and Red John, the ship’s bully.
With that cat-like swiftness he later ascribed to
his “Sea Wolf,” Jack had outflanked the foe and
sprung upon his shoulders, where he clasped powerful
short legs in a stranglehold about the roaring bull-
throat, while his fingers sought eyes and windpipe of
the confounded raging brute under him. The only
recourse left the Swede was main strength, which
he used, perhaps by mere instinct, in butting his
captor against the deck beams. This inflicted
bloody and painful damage to the young tiger’s
scalp and crouched shoulders. But those excruci-
ating pointed digits in larynx and eye-sockets settled
the issue, and the tormented viking was forced to
give in by hoarsely bellowing assent to Jack’s breath-
less repetition of “Will y’ leave me alone now?
Will y’ let up on me for keeps? Will y’ leave me
be? Will yuh? Will yuh?”
This passage is worth all the pages of
unadulterated hero-worship.
Mrs. London lias spared no details of her
husband’s fight with John Barleycorn or of
his first unhanpy marriage. Indeed, she
gives one the imoression rather of wallowing
in such incidents, dwelling on them merely
to paint the lily. 'Commenting on one bout
she writes: “But I knew my man, and, con-
tent or not, waited, remembering that I had
never yet waited in vain, to welcome back
the sane and lovable boy.” She has tried
to give us a true picture, warts and all.
But she has kept her wifely glasses on.
Jack London is deservedly popular. A
lover of the sun and open spaces, a wor-
shipper of grit and adventure, lie wrote some
of our most virile stories. With the breath-
less speed of his pen, he recalls blind rushes
for gold and wealth, mutinies on the high
seas, exploits from the tropical islands to
the snowy North. Ilis animal stories,
“White Fan"” and “The Call Qf the Wild,”
have hardly been equalled. Above all, re-
membering his early life, he fought for the
bottom dog m "The People of the Abyss,”
“The Iron Heel” and “Revolution.” But
he never wrote his masterpiece. Life was
too full of exciting events, and he never
recovered from his first boyish glance of
wonder at the secrets around him. He had
not settled down when he died. In his
writing life of 16 years he issued 50 books,
many good, none brilliant. His work, epi-
sodic and largely experimental, was the fore-
runner of the great book he hoped to publish.
Even just before he died, broken and ex-
hausted, he wrote of his ambitions: “I am
going to live a hundred years... .Just wait,
wait until I have got everything going ahead
smoothly, and don’t have to consider the
wherewithal any more, and then I’m going to
write some real books.” But it is doubtful
whether he had the material for anything
very great. He knew little of women. Even of
sea-tales he wrote nothing comparable in
character study and wide sweep with Joseph
Conrad’s. His political studies lack deep
thought, and only now and then, as in “The
God of His Fathers” and “The League of
Old Men,” does he show the tight dramatic
touch of Bret Harte. He was essentially
a propagandist, a soap-box orator.
I who knew him and his work agree with
his wife —“He was greater than his work.”
A flaming, happy, sympathetic personality,
he was one of the most lovable of men. He
loved life passionately and lived it fully until
there came a time when, weary with I.ls
ceaseless struggle for health and mental re-
pose, he could speak of death in these words:
“To me the idea of death is sweet. Think
of it—to go into the dark out of all the
struggles and pain of livine:; to go to sleep
and rest; always to rest. Oh, Ido not want
to die now —I’d fight like the Devil to keep
alive.... But when I come to die it will be
smiling at death, I promise you.”
L. R.
Northmost Australia
Robert Logan Jack, after getting his
apprenticeship and training in the survey
of his native Scotland, was Government
Geologist of Queensland from 1877 till
1899, and his enthusiasm sent him into the
comparatively unknown North to do much
exploring in the Cape York Peninsula. The
official reports of his two main expeditions
were published without his seeing them
through the press, and in a form that ren-
dered them misleading in many particulars;
so in 1913, when he had long been out of
the service, he set about preparing a revised
and corrected narrative, with adequate maps
and other illustrations, his idea being to
offer it to the Queensland Government for
publication. In the midst of his task it
struck him that the significance of his own
story could not be fully understood without
a critical study of the diaries of explorers
who had preceded him. This took him back
from Mulligan to Leichhardt. Then it
seemed that “the story might as well be
continued to the present date by the addi-
tion of developments since 1880, through the
instrumentality of surveyors, explorers and
prospectors.” Finally, in dealing with land
explorers, he realised that “they owed some
of their errors to an imperfect comprehen-
sion of the work of earlier maritime
explorers.” So he settled down to a general
survey of the whole history of exploration
touching Cape York Peninsula from the
time the Spanish and Portuguese navigators
in the mid-sixteenth century became aware
that a strait separated New Guinea and
Terra Australis. Thus the “reports” evolved
into two notable volumes, published by
George Robertson and Co., which enshrine
a remarkable record of assaults upon the
Unknown. We have here the story of three
centuries of discovery and adventure told by
a man who speaks from the verv heart of it.
In the author’s own vivid narrative and those
of the other explorers which he reviews in
the light of modern charting we are faced
with the indomitable spirit of the Men who
Blazed the Track and went out each in his
turn to success or tragic • failure. The boob
makes a very valuable addition to the his-
torical literature of Australia and will stand
as a fitting monument to its author, whom
death claimed before it issued from the
press.
B. T.
The inky Way
Dr. Souter (“Nil” and “Dr. Nil”), of S. Aus-
tralia, whose chanteys and other verses have been
making The Bulletin worth sixpence for 25 years
or more, will, through Angus and Robertson, pub-
lish a collected edition of his poems late this year.
Dr. Souter’s previous volumes have been “Irish Lords’"’
and “To Many Ladies,” but there is much of his
later and best work which hasn’t so far been inside
covers at all. ,
“Borom”: Melbourne ’Varsity is about to launch
a University Press,- which will supply students with
text-books, etc., at a fraction above cost. From
that beginning it is hoped before long to start pub-
lishing the works of members of the University on
both the literary and scientific sides. Such presses
are a prominent feature of ’Varsities in other parts
of the world, and by means of them many writers
who might otherwise fruitlessly seek a publisher
are enabled to get into print without delay. The
managing director of the Melbourne press is
Stanley Addison, a brilliant . graduate of the insti-
tution who for some years has been Assistant-Regis-
trar.
. there to be no end to the All Aus-
tralian tragedy that sends into compulsory exile our
native-born artists of pen, pencil and brush? The
l®?", to Pack his typewriter is John McLaren
( McAorth of The Bulletin), who sailed for Lon-
don by the Largs Bay. McLaren was one of the
founders ot the Australian Authors’ Association; he
is author of a dozen or more accepted Australian
novels, and has been responsible for more good Abo
pars and short stories than most Inky Way men in
Australia. It seems a pity that we can’t clap the
Australian brand on our worth-while men and women
instead of exporting them as “starvers” to a foreign
market. it must be our own fault, for no sane
human being would become a wanderer on the face
of the earth if there was honor and bread to be won
at home. The Australian Authors’ Association was
a desperate attempt to save the home-grown craftsman
from the machinations of the huckster of cheap maga-
zine provender, which (one or two journals of repute
excepted) has as fatal an attraction- for the average
newspaper proprietary as the wares of a Johnnie
Allsorts have for wayback youngsters. We are a
young people, true, and our case is not hopeless. We
have begun (in a small way) to wear our own Aus-
tralian wool first-hand instead of exporting it and
then importing it. From wool to books may be ,a
far cry, but if Australia is going to win any place
ot her own in Civilisation we must look beyond the
sheepyards.
Edward Dyson'in reply: After all, Mrs. Baver-
stock does not disagree to any great extent with my
estimate of David Blair’s “Cyclopaidia of Australasia,”
admitting the more serious impeachment of Blair’s
judgment in excluding Gordon and Kendall as per-
sons not worthy of a few hopeful lines. But surely
she forgets her authorities when she implies that
because there are half-a-dozen treatises dealing with
a given subject it should not be adequately dealt
with in an encyclopaedia. “The Encyclopaedia
Britannica,” a model work of its kind, is peppered
with names of men and matters that have been writ-
ten out elsewhere. A cyclopaedia should contain
synopses of all such writings. For the rest I dis-
avow any intention of casting general discredit on
David Blair, or on his life’s work in Victoria, and
hope I have said nothing in which his clever daughter
will find any such imputation.
“R. W. McHenry”: Unlike Edward Dyson
(R.P. IG/3/’22) I hate marginal notes. To
turn a leaf of an interesting book to find
it scribbled over by a previous reader who
has challenged or endorsed some of 'the author’s
remarks immediately fills me with a sense of loss. I
try to avoid seeing the notes as I approach them.
But they intrude slantwise through the eyes that are
focussed, into the mind that is concentrated on the
author’s words. At last lam forced to read them,
and I usually find them to be “Hear, hear,” “I was
there in 1915,” “Quite correct” —jtist petty glimpses
of a conceited mind. I get the same sensation when
T tread the shaded, moss-grown paths of a fern gully,
drinking in its beauty, its grandeur and solemnity
and—stumble over a jam-tin.
“J.F.H.” (Lorid.) : We are gradually getting back
to the sevenpenhy paper-covered reprints that were
so largely sold on the bookstalls in pre-war days.
They are now a shilling—which isn’t exactly seven-
pence, but is a long step from the two shillings of
three months ago. Arnold Bennett, Henry Jones,
Maurice Hewlett and Hall Oaine are among the
authors now available for the modest bob.
“Macquarie Street’’: “S.T.S.” asks if Squire’s Lon-
don Mercury account of a football match is poetry.
I agree with him that it is not;. yet it is Shaks-
perean compared with “Old England: A God's-eye
View of a Village,” by Bernard Gilbert. There are
two maps and several hundred characters. One of
them is Nehemiah Stennett, a barber, who has been
over to cut the Earl’s hair. He peeps in at an Aus-
tralian soldier who has ferreted out Fletton village,
from which his father in bygone times had been
chased by order of a nobleman. The soldier’s name
is Waddy, and Stennett soliloquises thus: —
“I lost the footpath through the grounds,
The evening being dusk.
And walking over quiet grass
Peeped through the window of a summerhouse
And saw Lady Betty, the agent’s wife,
In the arms of Oliver Waddy.
But they’re not like our lads, those Australians.
She was as tight in his arms as she could be,
And didn’t get out scot-free if I know Waddy ;
Not that she’d want to, by all accounts”....
There are 255 pages like this —especially like the....
part of this. To strike worse one would have to go
to Babelais, Zola at his impurest, or some of the
young-lady novelists of modern Italy.
“R. S. Adams”: Certainly Australians, re-acting
to the climate, are reaching out for more vowels.
The bottle-o’s friends are “Benpo” and “Micko.”
That terminating O satisfies his craving for the
vowel sound. At school bur master, Robinson, was
“Robbo”; our school mates were “Smithy” and
“Browny.” From “All right” and “Very good” we
have gone to “Righto” and “Goodo.” “Bonzer” or
“Bonza” has been traced to divers foreign sources,
and it certainly has a Spanish tang. It is sufficient
for the Australian that it appeals to his vowel
sense; it rolls off the tongue easily. When you come
to think of it, “Bonza” is rather a pretty word. And
the idiom of to-day will be standard speech to-
morrow.
“L.D.”: Lafcadio Hearn is a good example of
physical disabilities affecting mental output. Dr.
Gould cqlled him “the poet of myopia”: “Hearn
had the most defective eyesight—he was indeed
nearly blind. His choice of subjects and methods
of literary workmanship, and every line he wrote,
were dictated and ruled by his defect of vision.”
And probably lack of vision made him the consum-
mate color-artist that he was. He saw practically
everything indistinctly, being comparatively blind
to objects even a few feet away. (He had but one
bulging eye with which to see.) He saw with his
emotions; even _ better he saw with his soul; and
what can parallel in our literature his descriptions
of sunsets and summer skies, such diaphanous sketches,
painted as if with vapor? Hearn reveals what can be
done with the English language as a medium of
color. He is a study in adjectives alone, due per-
haps to that feeling after the definite produced by
the never-arriving-any where of his sensual vision.
The Mudgee Western Post has been swallowed
by the rival Guardian. The Post was one of the Ma
State's oldest provincial journals, having started
life SO years ago,. The Guardian is now the only
paper in Mudgee; and it is a sign of the times that
its proprietary owns papers also in Gulgong, Kandos,
Rylstone, Dunedoo and Coolah.
“Manning”: In the early ’seventies Henry Kendall
was clerk and storekeeper for Fagan Bros., mill-
owners of Gosford, at Camden Haven'(N.S.W.). At
one place he had as a customer a local poet who
wrote many verses and paid few bills. Whenever he
turned out any new stanzas he used to tack them on
the store-door so that all and sundry could read them.
Kendall stood it as long as he could, then Scribbled
underneath one “piece” :
This is the place to put your cash up,
And not the place to tack your trash up.
And there and then a poet’s heart was broken. The
local people later honored Kendall by giving the
township his name.

“Lee-oh”: In dealing with square-rigger
sailing records the old N.Z. Shipping Co.’s
Turakina should not be forgotten. On one
voyage from England she outpaced the same
co.’s steamer Ruapehu for some hours. The
screw vessel at full speed and with sail set
(she was barque-rigged) couldn’t overtake
the sailer until the wind dropped. The
Turakina often logged more than 300 miles
in the 24 hours, and once ran from the Cape
of Good Hope to the Leeuwin in 16 days.
She is still knocking out a living as the

“Percy Pawnticket”: Members of the
Jewish community are prepared to make
advances (if the security is sound enough)
to their Christian fellow-citizens; but they
don’t go much on the loan policy themselves.
Funds were raised some time ago for a hall
in Sydney in memory of the Jews who en-
listed, and to provide a social meeting-place.
The money already in hand is sufficient to
start the building, from which revenue might
easily be obtained to wipe off the balance;
but Solomon Mclsaacs and Levy Cohen have
definitely decided that they don’t want any-
thing to do with a mortgage on a place of
their own, and, until the full sum is forth-
coming, the building remains in the air.

“Sixenate” : A private detective in a Syd-
ney divorce the other day said he charged
3s. an hour .while “watching,” and got
nothing extra for a catch. This would
work out at only £7 4s. for a 48-hours’
week, even if the ’tec’s time were fully em-
ployed. And the gentleman who gave the
information is the boss of a firm which often
employs auxiliaries, so the mere journeyman
or apprentice would naturally get something
less. But, although this witness didn’t men-
tion it, the sleuth can often charge up his
hours to more than one person. In a popu-
lar Sydnev park there were no less than
five divorce cases budding on a single night,
according to a detective who gave evidence
in each.

“Agricola’s” diagnosis:—
“Hanno’s” reference to the use of carbon dioxide
in growing cereals (B. 23/2/’22) leaves me cold.
Much of Victorian vegetation is already lopsided
with excess of carbohydrate. Though the carbon
dioxide ratio in the atmosphere is small, still, in
our sunny clime, where no one has yet cornered
the air, great volumes of good breezes go freely
over each acre. Sunshine gives energy for green
leaves to catch and hold ample carbon. Our missing
quantity is not carbon but lime phosphate. Aus-
tralian soils are peculiarly low in phosphate, especi-
ally in the readily available forms. Hilda Kincaid,
M.Sc. (now also M.D.), of Melbourne ’Varsity, did
very valuable work in analysing our grasses and
cereals in 1910. She showed that the plants became
more or less adapted to the soil, and were corres-
pondingly low in ash. The Department of Agricul-
ture of N.S.W. issued a bulletin in 1914 which
fully supported her work. Carbohydrates make
fat in animals. Many thousands of fat sheep and
cows have died prematurely in Australia from “black
disease” and from paralysis (i.e., toxaemia) due
to debility of tissue and poverty of blood. Toxaemia
is relative not only to the amount of toxins ingested
but also to the amount set up or liberated in the
body, and to the rate of their elimination. In the
blood we find carbon-dioxide as a waste product.
There has to he in the blood some vehicle for con-
veying it to the lungs so that it may be cast out.
Phosphates sodium and proteids do the work, and
their shortage means auto-intoxication or toxaemia.
Team work has become essential in these days of
specialisation, and if nutrition was better understood
by chemists and bacteriologists and by practical
farmers we would be much more alive to securing
all we possibly could of Nauru Island lime phosphate
to spread over our “black-disease” areas and on
the farms where the cows die of “paralysis” and
“cripples.” By thus doctoring the soil we can re-
establish the deeper-rooting grasses and herbs that
have been eaten out by rabbits or through injudi-
cious stocking, and thus from the heart of Mother
Earth draw up in solution the precious salts to
enable green leaves to fix and hold all the carbon
we need.
FURNISHIN’.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No, sonny, I’m not drinkin’ now; I’m euttin’ out
the booze.
You see, a man ’as got to think when ’e ’as things
to lose.
I ain’t become a wowser, but I’m on to somethin’
good—•
I’m buyin’ furniture to make the ’ome be what it
should.
It’s very well to go an’ booze, an’ do your good
splosh in,
When you’ve got nothing much to lose (an’ I like
beer and gin
An’ all the rest as much as most) ; but when I
bought my share,
It isn’t cash that I should pay—’twould be a bit
of chair!
I saved a table up last month ; before that ’twas a
bed,
And now I’m on the kitchen stuff—in June we’re
to be wed.
If I jest took a single drink, perhaps I’d let ’er go,
And likely, ’fore the day was done, I’d spend a room
or so.
There’s no t.-p. for me an’ ’er—she’s not the t.-p.
sort;
But, dink.! she’s doin’ ’er bit, too: I tell you
she’s a sport!
An’ when we set together close, an’ what we’ve got
review,
It don’t seem much to turn a leaf and start a page
anew.
That’s why' I’m euttin’ out the beer. A man would
be a goat
For jest a careless thirst to put ’is furniture afloat;
Especially when ’e’s a girl as honzer as my Nell —
A man might put the wedding back a month, you
cannot tell.

Pretty when she wakes upl
j
THIS is the real test. The girl who
wakes fresh and radiant, with a clear,
smooth skin need not worry about her
looks. She possesses the greatest of all
attractions —the one which outshines all
others.
This need not discourage the girl whose
complexion is not so good. Proper care
will soon transform her skin into one
admired for its perfection.
Simple—Beautifying
The remedy for a coarse skin, for one
disfigured with blackheads or ugly blot-
ches, is daily cleansing \v>ith a lather
blended from palm and olive oils.
Such a treatment is so mild and soothing
that it softens the skin and keeps it
smooth. But it also removes the accumu-
lations of dirt, oil and perspiration which
are responsible for most bad complexions.
You can’t neglect your skin and expect to
keep it blooming and alluring. The pow-
der and rouge you use to conceal defects
deceive no one.
The Soothing Cleanser
Palmolive is the modern combination of
the same beautifying cosmetic oils that
Cleopatra used in the days of ancient
Egypt. These oils are just as valuable to-
day, and they are available in the more
convenient form of a fragrant green cake
of Palmolive Soap.
Massage its smooth, creamy lather softly
into the tiny pores which compose the
surface of your skin. It will remove the
clogging deposits which enlarge these
pores, cause blackheads and invite
blotches.
Dry skins are benefited by cold cream
after cleansing. If unusual dryness be your
trouble, apply a little cream before as well
as after washing.
Palmolive is at once a cleanser, a tonic,
and a balm. Though so thorough and
beneficial in action, it is as gentle and
mild as a zephyr. Palmolive cleanliness
is different. You will appreciate it.
Sells everywhere at
113 per cake
The guest-size cake of Palmolive Soap will be sent
post free on request by The Palmouve Company
(Australasia) Ltd., Broughton House, Clarence
Street, Sydney.

Cleopatra's Way
With a world of ancient beauty arts at
her command, she depended on clean-
sing with Palm and Olive Oils to
protect, improve and preserve the
freshness and smoothness of her skin.'
This beautifying was not confined to
face alone. The bath was a daily
ceremonial with all ancient peoples,
Palm and Olive oils the cleansers used.
Bathe with Palmolive and keep your
skin smooth and white. It is a luxury
til can afford.

rls a source of pleasure and pride to the Vacuum Oil Coy. Pty. Ltd
to know that the efficient metnods of Lubrication that exist
Australia to-day are due to its untiring’ efforts.
Twentv-five years ago. when this Company commenced operations
in Australia the common practice was to secure whatever lubrication
was possibl'e by the use of Tallow, Animal, and Vegetable Oils, which
not only failed in efficiency, but retarded the march of invention and
progress.
The Vacuum Oil Coy. Pty. Ltd. raised Lubrication to a sc.ence in
Steadily and surely it educated plant owners to the advantages of
correct Lubrication, by the use of high-grade mineral oils, properly
applied.
As a consequence, ma-
chines were enabled to
'erform their allotted
tasks smoothly, efficiently,
with a minimum of fric-
tion and depreciation.
During: these 25 years,
each new problem in
Lubrication was met as it
arose, thus opening: the
Lubricants
way to a new mechanical
ape.
The Inventor, the Plant
Manufacturer and the
Power Engineer look to
the Vacuum Oil Co. Pty.
Ltd. for its advice and as-
sistance.
The work must go on.

L. R. Thomas., who succeeds Monty Ansell
as Registrar at the Speck’s T ni.. used to be
secretary of the London Medical School Hos-
pital. He served in Mesopotamia, where he
became a lieut.-colonel and acquired the
H.S.O. As a sideline he is a barrister.
“Rat Bushie, J.R.” : An old chap came to
me to witness the signature of his pension
claim. To the question. “Did you receive
free hoard and lodgings during the last 12
months?” he had made this answer : ‘ Yes.
Board and lodgings. 22/2/”21 till 21/0/21.
and 12/10/-21 till 11/2/’22; m Bathurst
Gaol.”
“Officer”: The matrimonial whirligig pro-
duces some queer results. The cook and the
housekeeper left an outback S.A. squat-
tage to get married. On reaching Adelaide
the cook got on a bender, and the lady m
disgust returned to the, station. Presently
she married the manager, and by and bye
the cook came back and took his old job with
his ex-sweetheart as his boss.
Menzifes’ Hotel is getting things done to it.
The old blue-stone building alongside the
present dining-room in \\ iiliam-street has
been extinguished and is to be replaced by
an enlargement of the dining-room and 100
bedrooms. It was David Mitchell, Dame
Nellie’s father, who built the main portion
of the hotel, the contract price being about
£50,000. In 1837 one Wedge, a surveyor,
gave £O7 for the whole allotment.
“Wilkins?’: To-day I bought a writing-
pad, only observing that the “Made in Aus-
tralia” mark was upon; it. On opening the
thing later I discovered the “picture” in
front was a portrait of Woodrow Wilson.
I suppose it is gratitude that makes manu-
facturing stationers offer a tribute to the
world’s greatest note-writer, but, all the
same, I would rather have found a dinkum
Australian sitting on the front page.
“Aek”: When the Huns’ ’bus was forced
down on an open space behind, our lines, the
apparently-deserted ground suddenly dis-
gorged about a thousand curious Diggers.
One enthusiast beat the rest by almost a
hundred yards. He helped the wounded
Fritz out, and solicitously if somewhat ex-
citedly addressed him in perfectly-accented
French : “Avez vous —avez vous —avez, vous
—cumagutzer. Compree, cumagutzer?”
The doctor had been called in to over-
haul the ancient grandfather of a book-
making family in St. Kikla. The patriarch
retains no personal recollections of Moses,
but he dates back somewhere b.c., according
to his family. The doctor looked him over
and shook his head. “Very old,” he said,
“very weak, very low. He cannot live long.
May go off within 24 hours, may last a
few ; days.” Then a grandson who also is
a good Jew, with faith in the longevity of
his race, suddenly chipped in. “Vat’s the
betting?” he said.
“McTrochus”: Gone to end her days as
a breakwater for the patent slip in Moresby
(Papua) harbor, the old the once
well-known coastal steamer of the N. Queens-
land sugar rivers. The bell on her bridge
recorded her launching in 1877, so she had
put 45 years of toil behind her. _ She was
an iron vessel, and survived the tricky navi-
gation of .coral waters 'with singular good
luck —mainly because of the many fine “un-
charted watermen” who paced her tiny
bridge in the old days.
“G.E.S.”: The postal people have been
often criticised for not doing things; but in
fairness I want to record something on the
other side of the ledger. The other day I
sent an urgent wire to my family to expect
me the following morning. The message
arrived all right, and an hour later another
wire, exactly the same, word for word, lobbed
along. The only trouble was that the wife
thought I was on a jag and that the two
wires had something to do with twin moons,
double lamp-posts and other fuzzy things.
“CO2”. “Lexus” (B. 9/3/’22) is right
to this extent, anyway—grey is invisible
when worn with a wig and gown. One day
last summer Blackburn, V. 0., appeared in
the Adelaide Supreme Court wearing a light,
grey suit under his cassock. Murray, C.J..
glared in his direction. “I’m afraid I can-
not see you, Mr. Blackburn,” lie. said. After
the ban-ister had duly abased himself, how-
ever, the Judge consented to “see” him just
that once, and the majestic Law strode on
its accustomed" course.
“T. 0.1.” : The oldest Sydney building on
the George-street front between Park ano
Bathurst streets is now a tailory. It was
built in 1862 by Jeremiah J. Moore, who
from 1840 on had bookstalls against tlv
old cemetery wall near where the Town Hall is
now. Jerry eobbled boots, giving his customers
literature 'to amuse them while they waited.
The old man told me that his custom was
to visit ships coming into port and buy up
anv volumes the passengers had for sale. He
got his first lift with a book so purchased
for which a collector gave him £5. In the
early ’fifties he abandoned the stall and
secured a small shop opposite. Later on he
built the premises now standing.
“John Drayman”: Tas. Forestry Com-
missioner Irby, assisted by the newly-formed
Forestry League, is out to plant swift-grow-
ing pines on some 20,000 acres of treeless
button-grass plains and sand-dunes on the
Speck’s West Coast, adjacent to Macquarie
Harbor. The average yearly growth of
pirns insignis on the wave-washed sand-
dunes around , Strahan is over one
inch, “even,” says Irby, “though some
of the trees have their roots exposed
to the action of wind and spray.” It is
estimated that over one million of the Speck s
total. 16 million acres will readily lend
themselves to afforestation, and at least
200,000 acres of the million are definitely
known to be suitable and ready for planting.
Tasmania, with its enormous coastal rainfall,
could grow all the softwoods (some
£4,000,000 worth) now annually imported
by Australia. Irby’s idea is to first set up
a forestry training-college for_ youths, then
establish 80 forest schools of 2500 acres each,
every school to train and employ 50 boys. The
boys are to he mostly imported, the British
Government to be asked to .subsidise the
scheme. Thus three birds are to be shot
with one stohe —(1) The reclamation of vast
areas of waste land : (2) the reclamation of
destitute child life; (3) readjustment of
population within the Empire. It is a large
programme worthy of a trial.

“Orney”: Down south in N.S.W. there’s
a pub kept by a Syrian. His wife’s mother
was a German, and her dad a Chinaman.
The pair have two or three nippers, and the
girls are decidedly pretty; but what nation-
ality are they, anyway ?-
Here’s a fresh pother about women M’s.P.
A member for an Ontario seat in the Cana-
dian Parliament wears skirts, and recently
a “constitutional question” was raised as to
whether the hon. member might keep her
hat on throughout the proceedings in the
Chamber. Aren’t men fussy?
Clergy and laymen were welcoming the
new Archbishop to a country parish, and one
of the speakers was a very great-grandfather
in years and length of pastorate. The
veteran was reminiscent regarding the num-
ber of years he had been in harness as a
vicar. “And,” he added, with fervor, “if
the Lord is pleased to spare me that long,
I’ll die in it!”
The unworldly-looking edifice with a stuc-
coed surface, long a-building at the town
end of St. Kilda-road, has now proclaimed
its purpose to the passer-by. Its name is
graven over the doorway—The First Church
of Christ. Such a complacent tabernacle is
surely going to have ideas of its own, and
there ought to be quite a rush of original
young things to be first to get married in it.
“G.N.”: I can’t say whether it’s by acci-
dent or design, or merely with a desire to
improve the flavor, but on the last two occa-
sions I have bought a half-pound packet
of a well-known brand of tea, a weighty
two-inch nail was among the contents. I’m
saying them up in case there’s going to be a
prize for the return of the biggest number.
“ J.C.”: In 1851 the barque Novelty, of
only 250 tons, built and owned in Auckland,
sailed from San Francisco to Auckland in 29
days. The skipper’s statement was backed
up by the dates of a ’Frisco newspaper file
he brought. It was this fast run that first
directed attention in M.L. to the California-
New York route as the quickest for English
mails.
For two months past Sydney and Mel-
bourne have been entertaining off and on the
Anglican parson who spends more of his
time dressed in shorts, a singlet and a pipe
than any other Anglican parson in the world.
His name is Done, and when he is at home
he is on Maubiag, which is a specklet in'
lorres Strait ; but he isn’t at home more
than one week m four—most of the other
three he is aboard the lugger beating from
one of his specklets to the other. Head-
quarters are, of course, at Thursday Island,
which has just achieved a new bishop—who
will get £390 a year and pay his own ex-
penses. No wonder these Northern pre-
lates get fat and soft.
‘‘Hounds”: While the nets are spread to
catch the sparrows, the eagles play up pretty
well as they please. The other day a pas-
senger who “found” an overcoat belonging
to an ex-Sec. of Lands in Victoria, and left
it to be minded at the cloak-room, was col-
lared as he called for it, and the Law dealt
with him But why wasn’t the South-
V\ estern District man who retained a cheque
for £l2O-odd, sent in mistake by a State Gov-
ernment department, treated likewise? He
knew he had no right to the cheque, but he
paid it into his account and worked on it
until a smart officer drove him to disgorge,
rossibly the Department, when it had ; maue
sure of the money, was anxious to screen its
own methods from criticism.
“K. Sped”: That unlucky 13. The Lon-
don Omar Khayyam Club, founded on Octo-
bei- io’ 1892, and noted for its deliberate
anti-13-superstition attitude, is scratching
*ts head. It often holds its dinners 'on a
3 otn, and has 13 members present. On
each occasion an artist-member designs the
menu-card. A couple of years back Arthur
Hacker, R.A., the designer of the first .card,,
made the 13th at the last dinner lie at-
tended, and he die'd on a 13th. The design
?norf le mem * for the dinner in December,
I.LO, was done by F. H. Townsend, art
editor of Punch. Two days later he died
suddenly. Then for the dinner on Novem-
ber last Claude Shepperson illuminated the
card. And two days later he died suddenly.
"Rio” hops over again:—
As to the machine-gun “Centurion” (B. 23/3/’22)
is the same old conservative he was in a Bulletin
discussion on saluting a: few years back. It was a
War-Office committee oi “Centurions” which, aftei
investigation, proudly announced in 1804—the days
of muzzle-loading smooth-bore Brown Bess—that “fire-
aims have now reached such a degree of accuracy
and handiness that no further improvement is to be
anticipated,” or words to that effect. “Centurion’s”
contention that the m.-g. should not supersede the
lifle because it fires ammunition so quickly gives the
very reason why the improved weapon should be
adopted. Tile same conservative argument was used
when the breech-loader succeeded the muzzle-loader
and when the magazine was attached to the single-
firer. But that didn’t prevent us using the superior
Weapon; we augmented the ammunition supply. And
with the development of aircraft it shouldn’t be a
difficulty matter to increase up to machine-gun capa-
city. Even the rifle soon exhausts its supply if used
long for rapid-fire at 20 rounds a minute.
i«/?;££; .u Let me assiire “0.k.” (b.
J.t>/2/22) that extension of the Food Adul-
teration laws to cover soap and starch will
noit correct Ah Sin’s habit of destroying
clothes. Ihe Chink long ago discovered that
brushmakers sell a little weapon called a
laundry-brush. This he applies remorse-
lessly to everything, from georgettes to boiled
shirts. Also he has found that caustic soda
is a better cleanser than common soda. That
is why “O.K.’s” linen. perishes swiftly. But
I don’t know Why any “white” laundry ever
uses soap, soda or any other dirt solvent. When
I, long ago, helped to push an ocean tramp
across the seas we engineers hung our dirty
duds, from greasy dungarees to sweat-soaked
flannels, across a rail in the engine-room
and played a steam-jet on them. The boiler
gauge registered 1501 b. pressure, and in two
minutes the garments were cleaner than
when new, and no damage was done to them.
I believe the Melbourne City Baths manage-
ment cleans its towels by steam, and many
“white” laundries do likewise with their gar-
rcr,”+s. But you can’t expect that of Ah
Mud.

-■X An Acid Test
Here is Guido Ciccolini of
the Chicago Opera Company,
sinking in direct comparison
wth Edison's Re-Creation of
his voice to illustrate ‘hat one
is identical with the other.
He is but one of the many
great artists who have thus
proved that Edison has accom-
plished his ambition to Re-
Create music so perfectly th; t
his re-creations cannot be dis-
tinguished from the origins s.
“Real music at last,” says Mr.
Edison—and he is right. His latest
invention is definitely proved an
entirely new musical instrument —
not a mere reproducer of sound, but
a faithful Re-Creator that has been
made welcome in the homes of
noted musicians and critics who
would not tolerate the old talking
machines.
The New Edison is the only instru-
ment that has dared the acid test of
direct comparison, the only one that
Re-Creates the soul and emotion
of the original performer with its
own records—and, moreover, plays
all other makes with improved
musical values.

"Richard III.,” as now produced by Allan
Wilkie at Melbourne Palace, is an interest-
ing change from his performance of the
Colley Cibbered version, wherein the murder
of Henry VI. serves as prologue—interest-
ing because it is probably a unique curtail-
ment in some respects, and a faithful observ-
ance in others, of the play which Shaks-
peare wrote. For instance, when the late
Henry Irving restored the real Maginnis
Richard to the English stage, after an
absence of more than a century, the storm-
ing and cursing character of Queen Mar-
garet was a notable feature of the show,
whereas the scene of the actual murder of
Clarence (played in that long-ago by young
Walter Bentley) was not staged. The two
murderers conversed in front of curtains;
the voice of Clarence was heard calling for
wine; a murderer remarked that my lord
would have wine enough anon; then they
both went behind the curtains to commit
the gory deed, after which the one who had
turned penitent reappeared and ran away
affrighted. But in Wilkie’s treatment there
is up noisy Queen Margaret, and the murder
of Clarence is presented in accordance with
the bard’s text and with capital effect.
Also, the rival tents on Bosworth field of
Richard and Richmond appear even closer
together than two semi-detached villas with
their fronts removed, and the ghosts that
worry poor old Richard in his slumbers
glide along to the next compartment and bid
Richmond enjoy happy dreams. Which is
strictly Shakspearean but highly ridiculous.
Allan Wilkie’s impersonation of the Glou-
cester who ensanguined his path to mon-
archy is glaringly and humorously hypocri-
tical, characteristically uneven in histrionic
merit, and always powerful in a rough way.
Between .the ancient and modern types of
Dickon he achieved an effective average. Some
of the secondary parts in “Richard III.” are
fat and juicy, others not so grateful. Purdie
and Fred MacDonald added nothing to the'r
Shakspearean scores as Buckingham and,
Hastings respectively, but Leslie Manners,
as Clarence, improved greatlv on his Romeo
and other performances, w.hile the two Mur-
derers (Frank Hoffman and James Cox)
triumphed over the crudity of their gro-
tesquely disreputable appearance. Victori-
ous Richmond (Frank Moore) was a dull
and stodgy warrior, clumsv in his method
of despatching the arch-fiend, and Felix Bland
was but a feeble Brakenbury. Of the three
women characters Lorna Forbes, as Edward
IV.’s wife and widow, was a brilliant suc-
cess compared with Pamela Travers as his
Majesty’s mother. The difficult part of
Lady Anne was handsomely but tamely sus-
tained by Hilda Dorrington. A convincing
Aniie as impossible, anyhow. Vera St. John
and Linda Gladstone did very well as the
two Princes, but the littleness of Linda

necessitated the omission of one scene in
this considerably curtailed and inadequately
staged story of battle, murder and sudden
death. “Richard” gets six nights to be
desperately wicked in—the longest run of
the present season.

Jascha Spivakovsky tackled a Stein way
grand at the Melbourne Town Hall on
Saturday night, and a full house voted the
performance excellent, tie opened in juiszt s
arrangement of naen's Organ F antasia and
Fugue, and found some noble work for bis
vigorous left Hand. Tne cnanges of leeLng
and tempo in Braffms s Sonata in F minor,
Op. 5, aept him busy for nearly haif-an-
hour, and nere Ins left was inclined to over-
play its part, tbougb in the second move-
ment it was perfectly behaved. On the
whole, the effect was striking, but not im-
pressive. He had the technical adroitness,
but the touch of inspiration was lacking.
The rest of his programme was mostly calcu-
lated to show ms brilliancy as a melodist
and bring a rapturous audience clamoring
for more. There was some delightful top-of-
the-key board play in Liszt's "Gnornen-
reigen.” The tinkling, dancing notes pro-
duced the requisite elfin atmosphere. In the
“Campanella,” written ,for Paganini and
translated into fireworks by the indefatig-
able Liszt, the Russian’s fingers were equal
to every test. The Chopin bracket was even
more artful in its appeal to the multitude.
It began with the well-known “Berceuse,”
and was followed by the “Butterfly” Etude
in G flat major, the Etude in C minor
(“Revolutionary”) and the Bolero in A
minor, Op 19. The “Berceuse” was well
handled, but in the next item some of the
butterflies were moths, the tone at times
being a trifle too loud. Whisking into
the “Revolutionary” Etude, Spivakovsky
pounded the bass in great .style and made the
Pole’s passion
vehemently public.
It was a fine read-
ing and abounded
in devil. The
charming Bolero,
combined with the
“G n o m e n r e i-
gen” and “Cam-
panella” afore-men-
tioned, started a
mass attack of en-
thusiasm winch
only abated at the
end of the evening
after the virtuoso
had granted three
or four encodes.

Everybody having already heard, or being

lings. No early doors, preferential booking,
numbered coupons, or other preliminary fuss.

Last nights of Nicola are announced at
Melbourne King’s, notwithstanding that the
inflow of patronage confirms one’s suspicion
that the age of stage miracles will never be
past. The Indian Rope Ladder Trick, now
added to the programme, comes as a re-
minder that Gunga Din’s reputation for
supreme conjuring powers is out of date, or
ought to be.
* * * *
The latest bill at Melbourne Tiv. contains
nothing absolutely new and original save
Talbot O’Farrell, and his points of differ-
ence are not very penetrating. Nimble
Henri de Bray and May Vivian are still
there: two people instead of one are flog-
ging a xylophone, and again we meet Suther,
the man who blows into many musical in-
struments (weird and otherwise) in aston-
ishingly rapid changes of clothes that miti-
gate the monotony of him. The Lottos,
too, repeat a clever bicycle turn that made
them popular when Harry Rickards reigned
at the Tivoli, and the taller of the lady Lot-
tos sings pleasingly in rich raiment as a
prelude to the revelation of a million-dollar
figure. A prettily-staged illusion turn is a
reminder of manv old friends, but Talbot
O’Farrell aforesaid bears a striking resem-
blance to nobody, not even Fatty Arhuckle
on the screen, though he must be within a
stone or two of Fatty’s avoirdupois. In
the first place, the large, ornately-garbed
Irish gentleman delivers a string of wheezes,
mostly bright, in a happy, well-fed tone.
Subsequently, he sings three or four ballads
in a tenor voice, the pianissimo notes where-
of have ceased to reach the back of the d.-c.,
though the occasional high notes, carefully
withheld from publication until they come as
a surprise, are full of sound and muffled
sweetness. His songs, however, are of the
mushy, ’Murkan sentimental order. Some-
how a particularly plump warbler seems less
suitable for touching one’s heart with a
mushy reference to dear mother than a lean
brother whose attenuated voice suggests
grief and woe.

Such a profitable theme as the alleged
nationalisation of females in Russia has
at last caught the fancy of a movie pro-
ducer, and the result of his efforts is “The
New Moon,” now flitting across the screen
at Hoyt’s, Melbourne. Norma Talmadge
is the centre of interest. As a disguised
Princess she arouses a Soviet to its Red-
dest fury by declining to be marketed like
the common herd. Prince Mikhail, played
by a beauty actor called Pedro de Cordoba,
helps the rash goddess in her defiance of
authority. Also unchained at Hoyt’s is
Grace Darmond, “The Beautiful Gambler,”
who advertises her lusciousness among the
underworldings that always have the price
of a Rolls Royce about them. At the
Majestic Anita Stewart has become one of
“The Playthings of Destiny,” but doesn’t
appear to feel her position while her dress-
maker keeps handy. Anita’s rival on the
same sheet is Billie Rhodes as “The Girl
of My Dreams,” and, like the other, has
all the chiffon that “dreams” are made of.
“The Son of Wallingford” is now trying
to convert his base parent to a life of
righteousness at the Britannia; and the
Melba is informing its customers that there
is something very nice “Just Around the
Corner.”

“Quinneys” filled the Sydney Playhouse
with fashionable applause for three nights
of last week. Vachell’s comedy was pvoduced
in the interests of the Bush Book Club by
a cast picked from Repertory players.
Gregan McMahon held the bridge as the
old-curio dealer from Yorkshire: and the
rabid old egoist couldn’t have said whether
it was McMahon or himself. Eleanor Ross was
the wife who bit hard, and Bea McDonald
the hysterical typist in love with Quinneys’
foreman James (Cam Marina), who is in
love (oil. shrewd apprentice!) with his
master’s daughter Posy (Rosamund Lums-
daine). Posy and James, bv the way, gave
the impression that each thought the other
might bite if approached too closely. Albert
Collins’s performance as Sam Tomlin,
Quinneys’ cheerfully dishonest brother-in-law,
was a joyful bit of character acting, and The
Bulletin bays have been duly packed and
forwarded to him.

“Katinka” was revived in the presence of
a houseful of old friends at Sydney Royal
on Saturday night. Gladys Moncrieff was
handsome and extremely melodious as the
bride, and Reginald Roberts brought his
years of stage love-making to bear on the
role of Ivan with great effect. Robert Chis-
holm was artistically objectionable as Stro-
goffi* and he shone in such singing as the part
affords. Mione Stewart played Helen Hop-
per (in which Flo Young was seen here
originally) on new lines, and her dancing
was a feature of the evening. And then
there was Phil Smith, most vital and vigor-
ous of comedians. Altogether the bright
and tuneful show deserves a solid run.

“Captain Kidd, Junior.” the story of a
chart and a hidden treasure, keeps Aden
Doone and Edna Keelev busy every evening
at Sydnev Palace. The piratical adven-
turer confines his cruises to a second-hand
bookshop and a cottage at Cape Cod. The
yarn is as innocuous as the Doone plays
always are; but Edna Keeley makes a sonsy
Scotch lassie. Mary Mac Lane. who finally
falls under the heel of the Irish conqueror,
the spotless Jim O’Brien, whose other name,

Vogue lady look fluffy; and Eardley Turner,

life in all but one point—he neglects to tell

Two new comedians who strolled on to
Sydney Tivoli stage last Saturday are the
shopwalker and the sweep of their art.
Scott Argyll is the shopwalker. He dresses
faultlessly, spins stories, most of them about
the Anti-Thirst movement in U.S.A., and
uses a tenor voice to annoy Mr. Hammond’s
friends: and this page would be more con-
tent if he cut that and gave us some
worth-while singing. The other end is Sam
Barton, who in outrageous apparel—worse
even than that of a recent jazz violinist—
indulges in clever trick-cycling, after, of
course, getting himself, his rags and the bike
in a worse tangle than the N.S.W. Labor
party simultaneously explaining its reverses.
A welcome return is George Hird, whose
ease in juggling multitudes of disproportion-
ate objects is a sheer wonder.

Wirths’ Circus, after circumnavigating the

there is a performing ass who is understood
to be able to take four hours from 48 and
show 50 as a result, but Wirths haven’t
quite completed negotiations with him yet.
In all other respects the show has added to
its wonderfulness, and Sydney’s first. gasps
of astonishment are due at the Hippodrome
on Friday (to-morrow) night.

At Sydney Haymarket the importance of
owning a dress suit is brought home to
the young mind with social ambitions.
“R.S.V.P.” demonstrates how Charles Ray
(this week a struggling artist) and his
Greenwich Village cobber are only redeemed
from disaster by the joint possession of one
dress-coat, for the wearing of which they
toss a cake of soap. Carrie Lancely and her
Melody Maids brighten up the bill; and
Percy McKoy humps Matilda and sings
“The Sundowner.” At the Lyceum Wallace
Reid adopts the “No Rent” slogan when
his landlady knocks at the, door of his attic :
but all roads lead to matrimony on these
films, and in this case also to an imitation
Chinese vase in which Wallace’s best girl
finds her dead dad’s ’ will. The Crystal
Palace radiates with a. story of the great
arc lights that lure the city-fogged country
girl on to the wrong turning. The pathetic
touch is given by introducing a grey-haired
mother amid the millionaires and the gold-
lured butterflies. After that, of course, it’s
all right.

“Firefly” has had a crowded week at
Adelaide Royal, with Rend Maxwell doomed
to appear most of the time in a tight and
singularly unbecoming page-boy’s suit, out
of which her fine voice bubbles like cham-
pagne coming from a tin can. Otherwise
the honors are mostly with the men. George
Gee manufactures endless fun of his own
brand out of what might have been a small
nart, and Claude Flemming gets as much
joy as the audience out of the “Sympathy”
duet in which he hues Edith Drayson till
on the fourth encore she has to break away.
Something quite new to Australia is to
follow —the piece, not the hugging. The
omin Rem in a strong mixed bill at the
King’s is the Snwing-through-a-woman illu-
sion winch Selhit puts up: and the popular
Hnmphrev R : shop Co. is having a succession
of crowded niehts in the open as a farewell
to summer and to Adelaide.

Mr. Rugrgr Peg RpOW t
After so much browsing on the impressionism
of modern water-colorists the old-fashioned art j?of
R. W. Bugg at Melbourne Athenaeum comes almost
as an astounding novelty. Most of his work
belongs to the late ’eighties or early ’nineties, and
has the scrupulous accuracy of an architect’s plan.
The first picture on- -his catalogue is “Temporary
Princes Bridge,” followed by “Falls Bridge,” the
latter, painted in 1885, representing a departed
feature of the Yarra unknown to the present genera-
tion. Several studies of Sorrento, - Frankston,
Brighton, Bendigo and other places are similar in
their handling. But the color is often pleasing.
Mr. Bugg never used a muddy brush.

“Thorold Waters” considers a fallen idol:
So it was not Matilde Marchesi who did the trick,
after all, and the young women who trooped from
Australia to the studio of the astute Parisian teacher,
veVy frequently on Melba’s own recommendation, are
now being informed by the queen of song and a Mel-
bourne writer who “introduces” her that they were
laboring under a costly delusion. “She [the Daniel
rejected the conventional teaching,” we are assured,
“and with characteristic independence decided to
solve the problem for herself. The result is the
Melba method, scientific and artistically incompar-
able.” Marchesi is scrapped; though that won’t
hurt her, because she’s dead. But what about all the
folk who would have it that Amy Castles was bull-
headed when, as an unmistakable dramatic soprano,
she had the good sense to clear out after a few months
and transfer to Bouhy, Marchesi having graded her
down first as a mezzo-soprano and then as “une vrai
contralto, ma chere”? What became of Regina Nagle
and all those others ? Most of them had the goods
when they left Australia. And there was an Ameri-
can girl named Parkinson who visited these parts in
her time with the kind of warble that one calls
“sweet” or “nice.” It had been whittled down from
one of the most gorgeous things that ever occurred.
Marchesi’s market was mostly among the American
and Australian girls, and few pupils went to her
from her own continent. Incidentally, the.suggestion
by Melba’s “introducer,” that “in the whole history
of music there is probably no one whose voice has
worn so well as hers,” is far-fetched. There were
others-who knew easy singing to be the secret of
vocal longevity. Lilli Lehmann, for instance, and
the Italian baritone Battistini.—Then—Santley . wax.
still an example of easy and beautiful singing at 76,
Patti’s voice was golden when she was older than her
great successor? and the voice of that English old-
time contralto, Bessie Palmer, was at 72 as marvel
lously-fresh and true as if its owner had just left her
’teens.
“T. 0.1.”: According to “The Green
Book,” edited by Bampton Hunt and pub-
lished in 1906, Dame Nellie Melba was
born in Melbourne in 1863. “Johns” puts
the date down at 1865. A Richmond (Vic.)
paper on December 11, 1869, had this: —
Little Miss Mitchell' a young lady of 10 years,
who did not, content herself with; singing in first-
rate style “Can’t. You Dance the; Polka,” but also
accompanied herself on the piano, was, we think,
the gem of the evening, and rightly deserved the
encore she received and responded to
by singing “Coming through the. Rye.” It took
the audience by surprise to hear such sweet notes
coming from a mere child. The incomparable
Miss Mitchell in singing “Barney O’ Hea” quite
outdid her former efforts. She is indeed a musi-
cal prodigy, and she will make ( crowded houses
wherever she is announced again.
“Tlie Green Book” says that the prima
donna’s mother was of Spanish descent,
and that the diva married Charles Arm-
strong, son of a baronet, at 17 years of age.
“Who’s Whq” says the marriage took place
in 1882, so if she was 17 at the time, she
was born in 1865, as “Johns” says. But
what about the Richmond paper’s concert
report?
“J.H.” (Lond.): Lauri Kennedy is at
the moment doing most-to hold Australia’s
musical end up in England. He gave a
’cello recital at Wigmore Hall last night
(22/2/’22), and the critics this morning
are unanimous about his art. The Daily
Express says his playing had “all the quali-
ties which go to the making of a front-
rank exponent of the instrument.” Dorothy
Mcßride, his wife, is praised, too, for her
help at the piano.
“Thorold Waters”: Hugh Ward has gone
in search of music stars, aqd ,-if with Melba’s
help he can persuade Pachmann as pianist,
Pablo Casals as ’cellist, Kreisler as violinist,
and Chal'iapine as vocalist to visit Australia
next season, he will lay the foundations of
a large public gratitude. If he cannot get
those mentioned, a fine second string would
be Busoni as pianist, Efrem Zimbalist as
violinist, and Elena Gerliardt as vocalist. If
the first lot came in 1923 and the others a
year later, we could begin to feel quite
musical.
London papers reveal that there is some
conflict of interests regarding Melba’s stated
intention of running a tour next winter in
England to aid the reconstruction of Covent
Garden as a home for opera. The secre-
tary of Covent Garden says the syndicate
has plans of its own, “but we do not know
that Dame Nellie Melba figures in them.”
As the London reporter expresses it, the
next word is with the Dame.
“Norbell” : Most of us are tired to death
of the moving pictures churned out at Lost
Angels, so there ought to be a big oppor-
tunity for an Australian picture industry;
but no native producer seems capable of
grasping the skirts of happy chance. Local
pictures, with a few exceptions, are as
mutton-headed as the machine-made super-
art impossibilities from Los Angeles. We
have hardly an idea for the screen except
bushrangers. Almost the first Australian
flicker was the preposterous “Kelly Gang,”
and after 15 years or so we have arrived at
“The Gentleman Bushranger.” This latest
picture has some wonderfuily-beantiful scenic
bits, but the story is a painful libel on “A
Stripe for Trooper Casey,” which _ it pro-
fesses to follow, and is beneath criticism. So
is the producing, and a great deal of the
acting. Cobb and Co.’s coach with the gold
escort leaves the wild, rough, lawless dig-
gings from the door of a fine two-storey
brick pub in a very modern street. A motor-
car is in the offing, and the woman in the
case prances around wearing Centennial Park
riding-breeches.
“Lud”: Female Christian names are the
fashion now for musical comedy titles. The
Williamson-Tait firm is shortly to intro-
duce “Mary” to us. No doubt “Sally,”
which is in the midst of a successful London
season at the Winter Garden, will come
along in due course. And then look out for
“Jenny,” recently staged at the Empire.
Leicester Square. For the. last-namied
Leslie Stuart has supplied some bright
numbers.
“One-Two-Three”: “Beamish” says (B.
30/3/’22) Hilda Dorrington, now play-
ing lead with Allan Wilkie,, was a one-time
star with Alfred Dampier. Not Alfred, but
his son Fred. Alfred’s demise took place
before Hilda’s starring days commenced.
“Hamfat”: Edna Keeley has been playing
the part of a patient at St. Vincent’s Hospi-
tal. Recurrence of malaria contracted in
India is the trouble. But she slips down
to the theatre for each performance and
when it’s over gets back to bed.
“QUINNEYS ,” AT SYDNEY PLAY-
HOUSE.
Bosy (Rosamund Lumsdaine) decides for
Jim (Cam Marina ) and against her father.
“Cornstalk”: “Alwyn” (B. 23/3/’22) is
wrong when he says “The Gondoliers” drop-
scene was painted by the late George Gordon.
Sidney Blake, now managing the transport
department for the Firm, was at the time
an articled pupil of Phil Goacher, and says
his old chief, who is now a large land-owner
in Westralia, painted the cloth. The second
act scenery was done by the late John Brun-
ton—he of the big voice and father of
Dorothy—somewhere about 1890.
“Norbell”: When Mrs. Scott Siddons was
at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, “A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream” was followed by
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” and the star fell from
Ariel to Eliza and Cassie. It is recorded,
that in one scene of “Tom” a whole chapter
of the Bible was read, and that “most of the
audience trooped out.” I once heard the
Gospel according to St. Luke exploited on
the stage. It was at an Easter Si—day
night concert at the Melbourne Loyal years
ago, when Nellie Veitch, then a young pro-
digy from Ararat, recited the parable of the
prodigal son, beginning, “A certain man had
two sons.” But nobody trooped out on that
occasion.
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
One of the Three Lottos, trick cyclists.
“Bally Who”: The “Sawing a Woman in
Halves” illusion, which has reached ' Aus-
tralia, has been the cause of more legal
threats and newspaper advt. warnings than
any other mystery act on record. Horace
Goldin and P. T. Selbit, working on the
rival circuits, Keith’s and Shubert’s, fought
the matter out in the U.S.A., and Goldin
got an injunction against allcomers partly
with the help of evidence that in ’l6 he
had given the same trick fo Bert le Blanc
and Jake Mack, who were then playing
revue with Fullers in Maoriland. Mean-
while the act was played by practically
every magician in the country, and, despite
the injunction and pages of advertised warn-
ings, women continue to be dismembered in
large quantities all over the States.
“Orb”: Talking of the ancient prejudice
against females on the stage, the Chinese
won t have actresses on their mind either.
When Edwin Geach toured Asia with Carl
Hertz, the magician, the conjuring was sup-
plemented at Shanghai by some moving
pictures, then a novelty ; but Sum Kum Fat
censored the programme and rigiuly blue-
pencilled any films in which women figured.
The Chinks reckoned that even shadow
females would bring bad luck to their play-
house for evermore. Incidemally, they let
off thousands of crackers in the theatre
after each of Hertz’s performances so as to
scare off the evil spirits so obviously in
league with the foreign devil.
“Smike”: About the funniest thing in
screen literature is Theda Bara as Salome.
The famous vamp, rather scraggy and over-
aged, tries all her old tricks without shaking
John the Baptist. She ogles him torridly
with her ball-bearing eyes. She smiles a
smile that nearly bisects her countenance.
She cuddles up, pawing his skin ; but there
is never a response in the placid prophet.
The subsequent proceedings are equally
banal. Miss Bara was never educated to
dance before Herod. Her gyrations in gar-
ments ample enough for Spitzbergen have
no beguilement. All through she is a humor-
ous oddity, satisfying only, in her clothes
and surroundings the American anpetite for
childish splendor.
“C. Ockney” : Robert Courtneidge has just
produced at London Savoy a new piece by
Douglas Murray, whose “Man from Toronto,”
he brought to Australia not so long ago. The
novelty which takes the place of the long-
running “Paddy the Next Best Thing” is
“Sarah of Soho.” Sarah is played by Lady
Forbes Robertson, who in the somewhat
distant past, as Gertrude Elliott, toured
these parts in the Nat Goodwin Co.
“J.H.” (Lond.) : In the Strand to-day I
ran across Hugh Buckler, not yet, I hope,
forgotten by Australian playgoers. He has
just finished a year’s screen-work for Stoll
and the George Clark productions, and is
now leading man for Arthur Collins in a new
show to open at Drury Lane. Unlike some
other London stage-darlings, Buckler did his
bit in the war—and a very strenuous bit it
was, until he ran into An till, who appointed
him galloper to the 3rd Australian Light
Horse in Palestine. Buckler finally had
an argument with a steel splinter on the
Somme, and spent the rest of the war in
hospital. Two of his brothers \veren’t so
lucky,, both going west just about the same
time. He and his wife, Violet Paget, talk
hopefully of renewing acquaintance with
the Land of Sunshine.
“Ancient Prompter”: Our manager was a
great stickler for acting at rehearsal. The
Huffy, “al-l-rigbt-at-night” pros, got no change
out of.-hjm. One of his fads was to sit
in the hack row of the stalls and sing out
from there, “Now you folks on the stage, act
up! I’m one of the audience. I’ve paid
my money and I want my money’s worth!”
A certain newly-imported mummer found
some difficulty in accommodating himself to
this somewhat novel method of stage-direc-
tion. The oft-repeated interjection from the
front, “I’ve paid my money,” got on his
nerves, and finally he dried up dead. An-
noyed, he strode down to the footlights and
shouted to the boss, “For God’s sake go
and get your money back.”
“T.W.”: Beatrice Miranda has abandoned
her long-standing job as Carl Rosa prima
donna and thrown in her lot with the new
ex-Beecham British National Opera. She
figures as principal dramatic soprano of the
new concern, and was in its jumping-olf
all-star cast in “Aida,” with Robert Radford,
Augustus Milner, Frank Mullings and Edna
Thornton —about the best opera ensemble
England is capable of turning out at the
moment. Notwithstanding her lon : spin with
the Carl Rosas, Beatrice is not so familiar by
name as her associates, who have done a
lot of concert singing as well as opera, and
have thus captured a larger English public.
“Marg.”: The other day a friend decried
my taste when I said rude things about the.
music of “So Long, Letty.” “Wasn’t the
waltz song,” he asked, “worth a dozen Sulli-
vans?” Wandering through the score of the
old, forgotten opera “Norma” last night, I
found the source of this popular melody.
Perhaps present-day composers don’t mind
where they get inspirations so long as they
get them; and, after all, dead operas are of
no more account than dead marines.
“Frinigga”: Mrs. Asquith’s first lecture
in New fork was an awrul frost. The New
Amsterdam was crammed, but the lady
failed from the start to hold her audience.
She read it all, sitting down, and as she
wore a big hat the sound reached nowhere
except the front stalls. Cries of _ “Speak
up!” were heard from the start, and in about
20 minutes a woman rose in the _ “balcony”
and denounced the show as getting money
by false "pretences. Scores of others fol-
lowed her lead to the box-office to demand
their money back.
“E.T.”: Pinero himself recorded the
annexing of his chief’s “reception” on the
first night of “The Corsican Brothers” at
London Lyceum (B. 19/l/’22). He did
it in a pen-and-ink sketch published in the
“Era Almanack” —the yearly edition of the
English mummer’s bible. Pinero makes his
entrance as De Meynard. Ist Gallery Boy:
“Hooray ! Brayvo, Irving! Hooray, hoo
•” 2nd ditto: “Shut up ! That ain’t
Irving—that’s Pinnyro.” Ist Gallery Boy :
“Then wot’s he mean by looking like him!
Booh ! Hiss-s-s!” No man ever had such
a crowd of imitators as Irving, he was such
an “easy mark.” At the old Gaiety—which
was only separated from the Lyceiim by the
width of a street—burlesques of the Irving
productions were frequently staged. Thus
“Corsican Brothers and Co., Ltd.,” appeared
soon after Irving’s first night. Henry’s
mimic on that occasion was Australia’s old
friend Teddy Royce, who is still living, I
believe.
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos early Australian panto-
mimes and their authors. William Mower
Akhurst, who wrote 14 Christmas annuals,
was born at Hammersmith on 29,
1822 —a century ago. He came to Mel-
bourne in 1850, joined the Argus as sub :
editor and musical critic, later transferred
to Bei.l’s Life in Victoria as theatrical
critic, and was also connected with the
Herald, then a morning daily, both papers
being in the Levey family. One of Akhurst’s
burlesques, “The Siege of Troy,” produced
in March, 1868, ran for 60 nights, helped
thereto, no doubt, by the wonderful scenery
by John Hennings and the equally wonder-
ful acting of R. H. Harwood as Cassandra.
In 1870 Akhurst went to London and had
pantos, accepted by Astley’s. the Pavilion and
the Elephant and Castle Theatres. He died
on board the ship Patriarch on the voyage
to Sydney in 1878, and was buried at sea.
Garnet Walch. of a Hobart publishing
family, wrote- “Trookulentos” for John Ben-
nett, of the- Victoria xneatre, 1871-72 —purely
local from start to finish. Walch was born
in 1843, and spent some years in England
and on the continent. Returning to Aus-
tralia he engaged in press work, and founded
the Cumberland Times (N.S.W.), then
went to Melbourne 'ln 1872 and produced.
“The True Blue Beard” and “Pygmalion
and His Gal —a Dear,” and later the extra-
vaganzas “Australia Felix,” “Adamanta,”
“Fronde Would a-Wooing Go,” “Beauty and
the Beast.” “Hey, Diddle Diddle” and many
others. He died only about three years ago.
THE MOVIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Three times a week my wife must go
To patronise the pitchers ;
She drags me, too, to see the show,
And writhe among the itchers—
The crowd which wriggles, ill at ease.
Tortured by picture-palace fleas.
The Glorias and the Normas pall,
Bill Hart cannot intrigue me;
I loathe these shadows, one and all.
And Mutt and Jeff fatigue me;
I am not stirred by stars like these —
I got my uplift from the fleas.
The sirens of the celluloid
Their futile plots are hatching;
I heed them not, for I’m employed
In surreptitious scratching.
My wife’s absorbed in all she sees—
I’m concentrated on the fleas.

PROPERLY
Saturday’s rn< -ng liad a fairly important
hearing on the Doncaster, Cup and Sires’ Produce
Stakes. Tressady Queen was a short-priced favorite for
the Railway Handicap, run over seven furlongs. Her
work over' the last furlong heavily discounts her
chances for the big mile. The Newcastle-owned Sir
Maitland was running on well at the end, and in a
punishing finish hit the line just in front of Norman
Falkiner’s sturdy little filly Even Song and Cool-
stone. Heads only separated the three. Sir Mait-
land, who won the Challenge Stakes at llandwiek
in January, carried lib. more than his Doncaster
weight, and registered a first-rate Doncaster trial.
Even Song was doing a bit better than the winner
ac the end, and though it is not customary for three-
year-olds to win the Doncaster handicapped at
(Ist. 101 b. she has more than a rough chance.
Braehead, another three-year-old, won the second
division of the Railway from end to end, and is
evidently quite as good as Richard O’Connor be-
lieves. .Tack Findlay and Gilray were solidly backed
to heat him, but finished nowhere.
As a rule the w.f.a. Rawson Stakes (9f.)
is a good race for outsiders. But on Satur-
day Beaufqi’d, the favorite, was the. only horse in it
_a bigger Beauford than ever. Eusebius, Syce
Knight, Swift Shot, Stare and Furious moved off
with him in line, but at the end of a furlong he was
out a couple of lengths, and he stayed there. Gal-
loping hard held he covered the distance in “53,”
equalling the course record of Bobrikoff, Westcourt,
Poitrel and Richmond Main. Half a mile from
home Lewis put the accelerator on Furious, but
Swift Shot, all out, was nearest at the end ;
Immediately after the Rawson Stakes Beauford
was scratched for the Doncaster. He is to be tried
against Eurythmic in
the Autumn Stakes.
Up to eight furlongs
he is certainly a won-
der. That he can
manage 10 was shown
in the Craven Plate
last spring. liillick
is confident that a
mile and a half is
not beyond him. How-
ever, a quick beginner
and free galloper such
as Beauford seldom
likes being cheeked
in the early stages of
a race, and events like
the Autumn Stakes
are not to be won at
a sprinting clip. It
should be a great
race, though, at some
of its stages, with the
finger of form point-
ing at Eurythmic.
J. CAMPBELL
WOOD, owner of
Panacre, Elf a ere
and many other
cracks.
In the two-year-old event Beauford’s stablemate
Salrak was installed as favorite in a fairly smart
field. This, though he has scarcely recovered from
a cold and was weighted (at lOst. 41b.) to give Theory
half a stone. He moved away quickly and led into
the straight. Then the cargo began to assert itself,
and over the last furlong Iheory downed him by all
her handicap. When the two come together under
the standard scale they will make a great go of it.
Soorak, another of the Woorak tribe, started in the
next division with lOst. lib. He was not. so forward
as Salrak. and and finished well back. But
he is a smart customer, and will do better in a week
or two.
The stable was in a confident frame of mind about
Salitros before the Rosehill Handicap (12 furlongs),
and in spite of his previous record he behaved
according to specifications. Carrying 9st. 51b. (101 b.
over his Cup weight) he quickly recovered from a
bump that knocked him about four lengths back:
came with a great run from behind at the turn, and
won by nearly a length from the lightly-weighted
Kashmir, who made up a lot of leeway in the last
half-mile, and was flying over the final section. And
so Salitros and Kashmir moved well into the lime-
light that floods the Sydney Cup.
King’s Trumpeter (Clarenceaux —Bon
Bon) is taking all the two-year-old races in M.L.
this autumn. His latest success was in the Pacific
Handicap at Wellington on Saturday. The colt has
an engagement in the A.J.C. Champagne Stakes,
but is unlikely to keep it.
* * * *
Gloaming declined the meeting with Amy-
tlias over two miles at w.f.a. in the Trentham Gold
Cup run at Wellington (M.L.) last Saturday. The
time for the race was very fair—3min. 26 4-ssec.,
which is but 1 4-ssee. worse than Budge’s often-
disputed record for the same distance.
* * * *
“Canty”: It was my first ride over the
battens in public, and the owuier instructed me to
bring iiis property to the front and keep him there.
An’ don’t forget,” he said, “when he reaches eacli
hurdle to stick the spurs in.” I did as ordered,
and at the last hurdle had a break of 20 lengths
on the field. So I gave the spurs a rest. To my
amazement the brute galloped right through the
obstacle nearly breaking his neck and mine. How-
ever, I managed to clamber aboard again and score
by a length. In the paddock, 10 minutes later, I
learned that I had won my first race on a blind
horse.
* * * *
The usual clamor is raging in England
over the size of the G. N. fences at Aintree. Last
year only one horse—the winner—stood up out
of an immense field of reputed champions, and this
year two well-performed animals were killed. The
lemedy is probably not smaller obstacles but smaller
fields, since it is an undi.-puted fact that the top-
note hers to the number of about a dozen in any
year find no difficulty in negotiating the Aintree
course per se. A committee of experts with power
to refuse the entries of misguided owners anxious
to boast that their favorites have had a fly in the
National ought to solve the problem. As it is,
the worst horse in the race often has as good a
chance as the best until the falls begin to wear
out the monstrous fields.
*■ *>**
, The King’s colt Weatherane (Lemberg—■
Vane Air), who beat his half-brother Lembaeh in
the big three-year-old event at Newbury last week,
is entered for the Derby. If he keeps well—and
he has been practically unraced up to date—he should
start a hot favorite.
* * * *
A.J.C. (Sydney) has increased the Derby
Stakes for 1923 to £Booo—a rise of £lOOO on this
year’s prize—and the Breeders’ Plate and Gimcraek
Stakes by £5OO apiece, making £2OOO events of
them.
* * * *
“Suds”: Talking of successful racehorses
that have suddenly shot into the limelight after a
career of deadly obscurity, consider the ease of
Realm, who won the Sydney ar.d Australian Cups,
and also had an Australian Hurdle and a V.R.C.
Grand National Hurdle to his credit. He was origi-
nally bought as a hack in Gippsland for £lO. and
it was only a trial at a rural meeting that demon-
strated his speedy character. After his first two or
three appearances round Melbourne he was bought
by L. K. S. Mackinnon for £650, and subsequently
proved to be cheap for the money. Realm’s triumphs
remind one of Faugh-a-Ballagh, who started to earn
his living as a cabliorse, was acquired for a trifle,
and ran away with a Grand National Steeple in
Maoriland. Quinn, the Flemington trainer, has had
some experiences with surprise horses. He bought
York (winner of two V.R.C. Grand Nationals and
an Adelaide G. N. Hurdle) as a yearling for 30gns.
The same price was given for Sojourner, who landed
an Adelaide Cup and brought in over £2OOO in
stakes—though not to Quinn, who had resold him
for 100 guineas. Another instance in the opposite
direction is Full Sail, who cost £lOOO, broke down,
was sold for a fiver, and in the hands of his new
owner won four good races in W.A.
* * * *
Already it looks as if P’ran and Colling-
wood will meet in the final of Melbourne District
Premiership. ’Wood are in a winning position
against Carlton, with 2 for 269 for the first day’s
play. Most of it came from Ryder (151) and L.
Keating (59), both n.o. Ryder’s was a streaky per-
formance ; he was missed twice off O'Keeffe in the
latter’s first two overs. Carlton fielded miserably
and. were without their star bowler, Truman. ’Roy
also made a sad beginning against P’ran. Going in
on a perfect wicket they met early disaster, and at
one stage had lost 5 for 63. The remaining wickets
added 68, but P’ran are already 25 for no wickets.
Grimmett (8 for 60) was ’Roy’s greatest source of
annoyance. A small figure bowling a slow ball as
if it tired him, Grimmett, like Mailey, depends on
break and length. The worst feature of ’Roy’s down-
fall was the failure of their best bats, Cody going
for 3 and McKenzie for 2, whilst Dummett and
Liddicutt each contributed a duck. ’Roy’s ancient
skipper, Kiernan, top-scored with 56.
* * «• *
Norths were playing for a draw on Satur-
day against Waverley, and it looked for a time as
though they might get it. Carter, who was leading
the boneyard team (vice Dr. Poidevin, absent) per-
severed too long with Comber and Hendry. Not
till the advent of Stevens (5 for 58) was Norths’
cake definitelv dough. Manly had run up 151 in
their first innings against St. George, whose response
was 46 runs short. Bubb (6 for 30) got up very
awkwardly at times. The Villagers could only man-
age 104 at their next attempt. And St. George
collected the necessary 151 with 6 wickets intact.
Wall (30 and 66 n. 0.) was St. George’s outstanding
figure. Mosman put ’Varsit3 r through for 208, after
declaring at their previous Saturday’s score of 9
fin 399. Yates (75 n. 0.) and Hesslein (45) battled
spiritedly for the students, but the length-bowling
of Anderson (5 for 83) had to be played all the
time. Mosfnan’s fielding was again admirable. Wests
looked to have a fair chance against Paddington
alter totalling 172, ar.d might have won if Steven-
son (98) had not been let off. Wild bowled well
for the losers. Marrickville “declared” against Rand-
wick with 7 down for 405 : and the racing suburb
totalled only 219. Steele, for the winners, besides
making 168 n. 0., took 4 for 63. Though Balmain
batsmen, except Love (63) and Wheatley (55), found
the Sydney bowler Asher (5 for 73) very difficult, the}'
won by 6 runs. Glebe’s 368 appalled Petersham,
who collapsed for 161. In a second attempt, which
had no bearing on the game, Andrews made a spec-
tacular 107 n.o. S. Thomas (79) alone of the Cum-
berland men defied Macartney’s swerves. The Gor-
don all-rounder took 5 for 52. Gordon won by 237
runs on the first innings. Waverley are two points
ahead in the competition, with Mosman next and
Norths a similar distance awav third.
* * * *
In Adelaide cricket the East Torrens Glut
is again easily ton, having gone through the seasor
unbeaten. Loveridge, Arthur Richardson, Murrav
Middleton and Stirling, aided by. Schultz, llymil] anc
Morton, form the backbone of an XI too good for
any local opposition. Sturt is second, and its stai
performer of the season is the veteran To.vnsen.
just acquired from
East Torrens. But in
the last match Vie.
Richardson, the State’s
captain in the eastern
matches, but latterly
quite out of form,
made a century, and
Willsmore, supposed to
be extinct, came back
with 187, including
7 sixers and three
boundaries in 10 con-
secutive strokes, and
34 made off ope over.
Charlie Dolling, the
best bat S.A. produced
between the time of
Clem Hill and that of
Pellew, is back in
Adelaide after a long
absence in London,
but has not got back
into harness yet.
ALLESIO, the
Victorian
cricket umpire.
Harry Halfpenny, Northcote’s ’keep, has
the wonderful record of over 100 wickets in three
years’ pennant cricket. He would have gone higher
than the Vic. second XI but for his batting, wfiich
is as bad as that of Fred Morley, the Notts.’ player.
When the latter left the pavilion the horse used to
walk between the shafts of the roller. He knew the
innings was over.
* * * *
Yio. Football League has ordered the nine
constituent clubs to raise their charge for members’
tickets from ss. 6d. to 7s. 6d., and from 2s. 9d. to
ss. for ladies’ tickets; also, it intends to raise the
general admission chaige from 6d. to 9d., plus tax.
Last season when football boomed it raised the price
to view the finals—and got not only smaller atten-
dances, but a decreased gross “gate.” It may yet
turn out to be a pity for the game that the controll-
ing body didn’t take this hint. A little more, and
the semi-professional footballer will be able to devote
his whole time and energy to the “profession” ; then
a scandal or two, and the game will become as
deceased and decomposed as professional cycling.
“Coast Tripper”: The sooner Joe Ward
drops his idea of giving a cup for 20-ton yachts that
must cross the Tasman Sea the better. The hardi-
hood of yachtsmen and the quality of their vessels
are not in question. The point is racing yachts
under 20 tons are not proper sea-going vessels for
these waters, and yachtsmen are not seamen. Going
to sea in any small vessel is like going to war, with
the difference that you cannot retrieve an impossible
situation by saying “Kamerad.” In thinking of small*
boat voyages that have been made it is useful to
remember that lifeboats, cruising yachts and pearl
luggers are not racing yachts and that very few
coastal trippers are Slocums or Mulhausers.

“W.E.F.”: Sunday tennis is coming.
In Puritan London, home of the English Sabbatii,
the Public Parks Association has recommended all
municipal bodies to permit play between 2 p.m. and
dusk.
In the tennis championships on Sydney
Cricket Ground last week Jim Anderson never lost
a set, and he overshadowed Norman Peach in the
final (6-0, 6-3, 6-4). The winner’s serving and
cross-court smashing were masterly. In the doubles
Anderson and N, Peach outed Frank Peach and Bob
Neil in straight sets (6-4, 6-3, 6-3).
• * * *
Patterson and O’Hara Wood had one more
meeting in the final of the South Aus. singles
championship, and the farmer put up his sixth win
since the war (Wood won in Paris, on a hard
court, in 1919). This time there was a hard fignt,
with Patterson always a little on top. Scores,
7-5, 2-6, 6-2, 8-6, and a hard finish. An hour
later they met again in the doubles. Here, unexpect-
edly, I-leatn, who played with Wood, seemed the
deciding factor. R. V. Thomas, Patterson’s partner,
was not at bis best, but with Patterson hitting like
a fiend his side just got home. The local players
had not much to do in the finals except watch.
Miss Boyd beat Miss Rendall, both Victorians. In
the doubles Miss Rendall and Miss Mountain just
beat Mrs. Lister and Miss Boyd. The mixed went to
O’Hara Wood and Miss Boyd easily, from Heath and
Miss Rendall.
* » # *
“Oozit”: S. Aus. may send a tennis team
to Sydney next May ; and if the unprecedented step
is taken Hone and Rowe will be among the visitors.
At the recent inter-State tournament at Adelaide
Rowe gave Patterson a good game and had him all
out in the final stages. His main artillery is a
finished backhand and a reliable service. In singles
h? prefers the base-line. Hone has a strong service
and big reach, and is generally severe, but needs
experience. He increased the pace of his service
during the recent tournament and developd a trying
chop shot.
* * * *
Gerald Patterson, who annexed the singles
and doubles tennis championships in Adelaide the
other day, winning the latter event with R. V.
Thomas against O’Hara Wood and N. Heath, has now
had 17 successive triumphs since his return to Aus-
tralia in 1919. His only Josses have been two de-
feats by J. O. Anderson and one by Norman Peach,
who put up the record of a love set against him;
but as these were exhibition games, they are not
supposed to affect his glory as a match-winner. Next
month he will enter the N.S.W. championships, and
will have to overcome much tougher opposition. Then
he will be ready to go to America with the Aus-
tralian Davis Cup team. He talks of settling in
Sydney on his return.

111 N.S.W. motor reliability test on Satur-
day A. W. Fairfax’s lightweight Citroen (24921 b.) did
138 miles on 2.875 gallons of petrol—4B.3s miles per
gallon. It was the only car to get maximum points.
A. McNeil (Fiat, 26331 b.) took 177 l-ssec. in the
hill-climb, and scored maximum points. W. Stuart
(Essex, 41721 b.) put up fastest time (149 sec.). In
the aggregate McNeil and Stuart dead-heated with
382.2 points each.
Disney’s motor-cycle record, Melbourne to
Adelaide, did not stand long. The distance, reckoned
at 560 miles, was covered, with passenger in sidecar,
in 17hr. SSmin. 55sec. early in March. A fortnight
later Korner, who was the holder before Disney, cut
it down again, under similar conditions, to 17hr.
25min. 41sec., and this in spite of an accident] in
the Coorong which lost an hour.

Cambridge gave Oxford an unholy lick-
ing in < this year’s boatrace, winning by 3J
lengths, with their opponents all out at the finish.
The Cantabs have a great stroke in the old Etonian,
H. 11. Hartley; and Fremantle, the other Etonian,
is the best No. 4 that has been up for years. For
once in a way there was not an Australian in
either eight.
The Billy llunefeld-Fairhall display at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night was one of the
poorest ever staged there. The Yank had been billed
as a man-eater —but, then, all his countrymen arc-
in Australia. He proved to be innocuous as a
puncher, and devoid of boxing skill. Fairhall was
known to most of those present as a capable third-
rater on occasion: against Hiinefeld his performance
was awful. After part of the audience had left, and
the rest had counted the gladiators out a number
of times, Joe Wallis said it was a draw. “No
fight’’ would have been a more popular verdict.
The veteran Herb McCoy was puller-out
for another match at Brisbane Stadium last week.
He beat Frank Locke badly over the first half of
the 20-round journey, and then youth asserted itself,
and in the 16th the pocket Hercules of other days
was outed by a right to the jaw.
Harry Stone, who met the youthful Billy
McCann at Melbourne Stadium on Saturday night, is
older than McCoy, and he has endured more punish-
ment owing to his predilection for leaving his
class in search of matches. Yet McCann could not
stop him, and it was only rarely that he was able
to hit him. But, then, the mercurial Yid is an
exception to almost every rule that exists for the
guidance of pugs.

This year’s N.S.W. Aerial Derby will be
over a new course. Instead of the straight trip to
Richmond and back to Mascot, as in other years, the
race will be five times around an 11-mile circuit,
beginning and finishing at Victoria Park Racecourse
(Sydney) and passing over Botany and Maroubra.
The change is a concession to the paying public’s
desire to see the race as well as the finish. Captain
G. C. Matthews, holder of the Derby Cup, will be
a starter, and the promoters anticipate a field of
about 20.

“Coot” : Atliella Bennett, the six-year-old
daughter of W. J. Bennett, of Kew (Vic.), has passed
the Royal' Life Saving Society’s exam. This includes
performing four methods of rescue and three of
release in the water, the drowning subject having
first to be carried at least 10yds. in the water, and
the Schafer method of resuscitation used afterwards.
In addition Athella was asked to swim breast-stroke
100yds. • 60yds. without using her arms; and
duck-dive to a depth of not less than 6ft. (she
went down 9ft.) and bring up a weighted object.
In one carnival the infant “saved’’ a constable who
weighs I6st.

“Umpire”: “R.P.” (B. 9/3/’22) puts a
eonundrum —-“A left-handed bowler is bowling around
the wicket and is not breaking either way, nor is
he swerving. Two batsmen, one right-handed and
one left-handed, are given out l.b.w. to balls which
were not full tosses. Was the umpire’s decision cor-
rect?” An “old international,” whom The Bul-
letin consulted, thinks the left-hander may have
been out and the right-hander not out. But if a
right-hander stops with his leg an identical ball to
that stopped by a left-hander’s leg both will be
just as much ‘“out” or “not out.” A left-hander
howling round the wicket at the leg peg of a right-
hand batsman without swerve or break will cause
the ball to pass the straight line between the bats-
man’s off stump and the stump nearest the bowler
when it (the ball) is lift, away from the batsman’s
off-stump, provided the ball is delivered at the bowl-
ing crease 40 inches away from the stump nearest
the bowler’s feet. For a left-hander to bowl a
yorker to hit the same leg peg the ball that neither
breaks nor swerves would have to be delivered at the
bowling crease at a point 109 inches from the
nearest stump. A straight non-swerving ball can
therefore be bowled by a left-hander to justify the
umpire cited by “R.P.,” so long as the ball is
delivered from not outside 109 inches from the
stump nearest the bowler at the bowling crease.
And as 109 in. is a long way out, so it is very
probable that the majority of left-handers send down
quite a lot of balls capable of filling the bill so long
as the batsman, he he right- or left-hander, will
only oblige with his leg.
LOYALTY.

“Later his Majesty’s horse John Green won a
five-furlong handicap. There was great enthusiasm
over the Royal double, and the most intense critics
declare that it is the happiest day in the racing
world since Minoru won the Derby. They point out
that the King’s success follows years of disappoint-
ment and discouragement.”— Cable.
I: do not care that I am broke
And life is full of trouble:
The worst of cares is now a joke,
And sorrows but a bubble!
God bless the King, I gaily sing,
And in the air my headgear fling,
And cheer and cheer like anything—
The King has won a double!
I stood to win a thousand quid—
The King’s horse burst that bubble
And got in first. I’m glad it did—
To walk home is no trouble 1
And I, a loyal Citizen,
Grudge not a thousand now and then
To give the nation gladness when
The King has scooped a double 1
Hoorah! M3' common creditors
Who have been agitating
To get their cash —the sordid bores —■
Will have to go on waiting.
If they ask money from me now
I’ll tell them why I’m broke and how,
And call each a disloyal cow
Who’s with the Bolshies mating.
And so I cheer and rave and shout,
Stand on my head and leap about,
Joy-drunk, relieved from trouble,
Because the King hath fortune struck—
Yes, after years of rotten luck
He’s struck a racing double!

Think of all the Hebrew names well
known in Melbourne, and you will have the
list of among-those-present at a crowded
ball in St. Ivilda Town Hall on the 29th.
The whirl was organised by Jewish ladies
to help the fund for “Stricken Europe.”
The G.-G. and Lady Forster gave their bless-
ing and a cheque, but were unable to go.
Monash the Great was also a patron. The
dressing was “plain and fancy,” and was
frequently fancy where its intention was
plain. Ada Reeve, who did the judging,
was herself gorgeously attired in ivory silk
embossed with gold roses and pink blossoms
running round her plump figure in hoops.
Mayor Cummings gave her a helping hand
Somebody donated the music—supplied by
Miss McEwan’s band. The supper expenses
were kept under by having voluntary
waitresses and by numerous food donations,
and sweets, cigarettes and balloons were sold
to pile up the profits.
The Anzac Hostel’s new ballroom floor
was warmed up for the first time on Thurs-
day night, when the Women’s Automobile
Club hired the main room for a dinner-dance.
Tables were spread under the balconies, and
the floor lured hosts of jazzers, who did
whatever jazzers do from 7 o’clock till mid-
night ; and a dinky dinner was served up by
the Digger chef from the kitchen regions
below. Club president Mrs. Gabb, in flame-
colored velvet, hostessed one big party, and
ex-president Mrs. Lambert, in lacy draperies
of crushed strawberry, handled another squad
at the opposite end of the room. The Henry
Harpers ran a party in one corner, and the
Moffats had a vividly-frocked group in
another. The sitters-out soon discovered
the advantages of the balcony overhead,
which curves in bays and bows all round
the room.
Spivakovsky drew a large house for his
first concert in the Town Hall on Saturday.
The ’G.-G.. comfortably relaxed after a
strenuous day’s yachting, lounged back in
his big leather chair and placidly enjoyed the
music. He left it to the volatile aide De la
Coeur to do the applauding. Lady Forster,
muffled in furs, wore a wreath of green
leaves in her hair and toasted tiny black
satin toes at the electric radiator. Nellie
Stewart was near by, wearing an ermine-
lined coat with a little vivid hat pulled over
her ears. Only her adorable nose and chin
were on view. Lawyer Leon bad a party
in two rows and talked with musical excite-
ment in the intervals.
Austral Salonites welcomed young Jascha
Spivakovsky on Friday night with musical
accompaniments. Mrs. Quinnel, the Salon’s
hon. ,sec.„ who spoke the glad-to-meet-you
piece, got the laugh of the evening by wel-
coming the guest as “Mischa Spianoskov-
sky.” For over an hour poor Jascha, glued
to the chair of honor, was subjected to a
more-or-less musical bombardment. A quar-
tette of girleens played flute, bugle, piano
and fiddle; songs were sung by Kirby, Taylor
and Scott: and Ada Freeman courageously
thundered out a Liszt number on the Salon’s
grand—and an encore. Through it all the
star pianist bore u.p wonderfully : but. after
cr-Tee and cake his* manager plaintively sug-
gested that Jascha should step off his perch
and get acquainted -with the crowd. A little
later he nearly collapsed in horror when he
saw his precious charge caught in a strug-
gling mass of autograph-hunters, and in
desperation he convoyed Jascha from the
scene lest his oyer-worked fingers should be
crippled for his opening night.
Robert-Garran and his wife gave a party
at it he- Arts Club Rooms to meet pianist
Spivakovsky a few nights ago. Something
like 400 people battled up the narrow stairs
that lead to the highbrow club, and got
wedged at the last turn, as hurried hand-
shakes were being put through on the floor
above. Nobody looked for such numbers,
and space was hopelessly inadequate. The
stair-rail formed an impromptu cloak-room,
with the result that the outside of the Temnle
of the Most Intellectual looked like an old-
do’ shop. Of course, the Best Furred
clung to their wraps with tooth and claw—
it is so-o-o-o necessary nowadays, even in
the naicest sassiety. The chief guest was
buffeted about by a sea of enthusiasm, so he
simply must be convinced that Melbourne is
musical.
Mrs. Thorold Harper hostessed an at-home
«it Tooralc the other evening: it was to help
the Mermaid Society, which had threatened
to fade away through financial malnutrition.
Mrs. Thorold, who comes from the Cold
Country, had draped her prepossessing per-
son in moonlight-blue over black and gold
lace. Mermaids Mrs. Gibson Young, Enid
Derham and Airs. Agar shared the talk about
the past, present and future of the society;
Harold Browning sang attractively, Beatrice
Tiernan did a recitation, and Mrs. Apperly,
the society’s “producer,” exhibited her talent
for comedy in a bit of the first scene of
“Peg o’ My Heart.”
A Town Hall audience overflowed the
other night when Weber and Rice, with their
pupils, demonstrated the latest methods of
developing mental muscularity and muscular
mentality in exact proportions and due rela-
tion to’ health. Strong-man turns were
brightened by several wrestling and boxing
displays, and insets of living statuary. These
last, with a double file of white-silk-suited dam-
sels, who stepped round with perfect poise,
amply proved that physical culture develops
beauty as freely as it produces muscle. One
jiu-jitsu girl showed how simple a matter
it is to lav out a male assailant if you only
know how. The medical Barrett knight
threw verbal bouquets at Weber and Rice as
health-developers before handing over the
medals to those pupils who were not too shy
to step up and claim them.
Louis Esson makes his debut as a “pro-
ducer” at Melbourne Playhouse on May 18,
when he will stage “The Battler,” a newly-
written three-act comedy and study of char-
acter in an old fossicking centre. Esson hopes
that this will be the first shot in a new
campaign to interest Australians in local
drama. He has other pieces pending, one of
them a four-act study of early Australia,
which will probably be presented at the end
of the winter. Esson is working very hard
for success: he has dropped all other activi-
ties for the present to concentrate on this
big attack.
After Billy Hughes had handed Warwick
Armstrong the cheque for £2500 at the
smoke social in the Town Hall, one of the
guests in a loud whisper crystallised a
thought that had occurred to a few hundred
already—that the amount did not necessarily
indicate that the community had for War-
wick only one-tenth of the regard it had
for the Priminister. The whisperer also
ventured the opinion that the Armstrong
subscription list contained more sports than
were on the roll of donors who made up
the £25,000 for W. M. Hughes.
Barrie’s “A Kiss for Cinderella” is to be
put on by amateurs at the v Playhouse on
May 15 aind 16 to benefit the Yooralla Free
Kindergarten. Some old P.L.C. girls are in
the cast.
Hilda Dorrington. who is playing leads
with Allan Wilkie while Miss Hunter-Watts
goes to Europe on
holiday, is an ambi-
t i o u s Australian
who has already had
successes in
America, India and
London. She has
just come back with
a host of worth-while
press notices and
enough experiences
to fill an illuminat-
in g autobiography.
Now she has “ar-
rived” Hilda Dor-
rington doesn’t mind
confessing that her
childhood days were
rather disturbed by
conflicting ambitions.
She found it ter-
ribly hard to decide whether to be a nun, a
school-teacher or an actress. Having the
gambling instinct and love of sport of the
Australian, she probably tossed for it, and
stage came out on topi
A Victorian Judge who is a fresh-air
crank turned up at a seaside resort one night
a little while ago without having engaged a
room, and was shown to a dormitory which
he had to shave with others who were already
half asleep. ’Sonor hastily disrobed in a
dim light, doused the glim and sank into bed.
After he had tossed about for an hour or
more, murmuring as to the place being “too
stuffy” and “more sea-air wanted,” his room-
mates heard him scramble out to open the
window. For a time he fumbled with some
sort of a latch to no purpose: then be reached
for his boot. There followed a crash of glass
and the loud sniff of the Judge as he breathed
ecstatically: “Ah, that’s better —ozone, won-
derful ozone!” With that he ambled off to
bed and slept the sleep of a learned and just
judge. Daylight disclosed that the glass he
had smashed so satisfactorily was that of a
bookcase.
The Felton Bequest folk have just bagged
a Van Dyck—a portrait of Rachel de
Duvigny, Countess of Southampton, painted
in 1640. Lady Lucas, who inherited the pic-
ture along with some other famous _ Van
Dycks, has sold it to the Gallery for £15,000,
George Klug, Australian manager of the
big mine-directing Bewick-Moreing firm,
sails for the Cold ' Country in the Mantua.
This is his first European trip, and it will
probably mean mixing business with pleasure.
The Mcßobert family—the late head of the
house used to belong to the Robert Harper firm
—has been wintering in the Riviera, and in
the wonderful flower and fruit market at Nice
they found “enough wattle-blossom to paint
an Australian hillside with September gold.”
At All Saints’, St. Kilda, the J. A.
McLeods’ second chick. Dorothy, breathed her
matrimonial vows to Ernest John Philip, of
a Hamilton clan. She dimpled happily in
silk lace veilings under brocaded charmeuse,
with tulle veil and orange-blossom accom-
paniments, plus, a blush-pink, lining to her
satin train. Her sister Ilona and the bride-
groom’s sister. Elbe bi'idesmaided pictu-
resquely in georgette fixings. One wore
blue, the other pink, and both sported black
lace-draped hats. Dad gave Dorothy away,
and Eric and Lance Learmonth came up
from Hamilton to support the bridegroom.
After the knot had been well and trulv tied
the McLeods entertained a marqueeful of
guests at Malonga, their Caulfield residence.
Mrs. McLeod was in navy-blue crepe de
Chine, and her golfing-expert elder daughter
also wore navy blue with a pink hat and red
bouquet. Later on the newly-weds set off
in a storm of rose petals to honeymoon in
the Speck.
This French photo shows Alan Mitchell,
the young Australian tenor who is returning
to the local concert
platform after an
absence of seven
years, most of them
passed in the war
zone. He left in
February, 1915, and
was a member of the
first organised con-
cert party in the
A.l.F.—that was in
Cairo. Subsenuently
he crossed to France,
where he sang now
and again with the
4th Division partv.
Shedding his khaki
after the Armistice,
he placed his voice

of Tommy Black-

Gerald Patterson has a date this week
with Miss Riggall, of The two
will honeymoon around tennis courts. They
go to the inter-State match in Sydney, wait
for the championships in May. then sail' off
to America with the Davis Cup huntsmen.
Daryll Lindsay and his new bride, Joan
Weigall, are on the doorstep; they were
married in London early in February, and
overlanded from Calais to the Mediterra-
nean, where they picked up their boat after
a look at the Riviera. Brother Norman is
coming down from his mountain fastness in
N. S. Wales to welcome the brother he leans
upon more than any other.
The generosity of H. L. White, of Bell-
trees, in presenting a wonderful collection
of birds’ eggs to the Melbourne _ Museum,
deserved a better return. The cabinets have
been packed away in the vaults, though room
could have b°en found for them by compress-
ing the mineral and fossil exhibits which
now take un four galleries. The collection
is visited bv the few who take the trouble
to get a permit:; but the general public is
unaware of its existence.
In October of last year Edward. Dyson, in
a “Red Page” article, advocated the setting
up of statues with something of the quality
of cartoons in our public parks and high-
ways. The Idea appealed to G. K. Chester-
ton, who, in a speech at the Dickens Fel-
lowship dinner in London, proposed, as what
the Argtjs calls “a brisrht idea” for enliven-
ing London, a series of statues of well-known
comic characters. He would commemorate
Dickens, for instance, with effigies of Quiln.

There was an echo of war work in the
winding up of the Union Jack Rest Rooms
business. A balance of £154 was panned
off after all expenses were paid, and this has
been divided between the Associations for
Blind Soldiers and Limbless D gger* with
the approval of trustees Baldwin Spencer
and R. W. E., Wilmot. The Rest Rooms
were run by Miss Rennie, and were among
the first of the kind during the war. Fre-
quently they saw 300 Diggers a day served
with meals/music, fags and rest.
Victoria threatens to avai’- testify to a
lack of imagination. Since IS39—three years
later than the Hentys’ original settlement—
some forest country a few miles from Gee-
lon’ - has been called Jan Juc. The Gundrys,
first settlers, called the place Ironbark,
but friendly abos.’ reference to the locality
as Jan Juc (Big Tree) led to adoption of that
apt name. But somehow "Jan Juc ditln t
look pretty to the sensitive dwellers in those
parts and they decided to have no more of
it. They have chosen as substitute (Pity
them!) BeJbrae, a hybrid, neither Scutch,
French, English, abo., nor Australian.
The Man in Grey who was recently, estab-
lished at Spencer-street has been given a
megaphone to help him in his job. Ihe
unfortunate general-inquiry agent was re-
cruited from the hardy spruikers of Bourke-
street, but his clarion, confident voice has
grown weaker and almost querulous under
the never-ending avalanche of questions, and
he now takes a depressed view of life.
“Women!” he groans, and holds up his
hands in token of surrender —“they do ask
such silly questions!” .
When the Herald establishes itself in its
new home in Flinders-street it will not be

good employment to poilus for whom the

be extended in Australia.
A coo-ee from Adelaide: —
The Weigalls got back from Marble Hill in time
to look in at the tennis finals and for his Ex. to
listen to the lecture on the Northern Territory by
Surveyor-General T. E. Day.
The Girl Guides made a bid for funds with a. fete
at Government House, opened by Lady Weigall as
chief guide and with the Butler dame as general con-
troller and director. The gate-money was good and
business brisk, so the committee looks for a useful
cheque. Mrs. Keith Bowman produced a bag-and-
basket stall that was a joy, and the cake stall,
run by Mrs. Dick Hawker, Mrs. Frank Fisher and
half-a-dozen youthful matrons, did Adelaide’s cooking
proud.
We are living in an orgy of tournaments —first
tennis, then polo, finally croquet, at which Mrs.
H. B. Horton won both the single and double cham-
pionships, with Mrs. Pedlar as her partner in the
latter. Polo enthusiasts have lived at Birkalla for
a week, and the Weigalls were among the crowd
that saw the Adelaide B team win the Melrose
Gup from the Wanderers.
The Women's Non-party Association had a special
meeting the other night to hear Mrs. Darnley Nay-
lor’s impressions of a year’s wanderings, and to
listen to her plea for more organised action by
women in public affairs. It was the Non-party Asso-
ciation that combined with the Westralian Women’s
Service Guild in forming the Australian Federation
of Women’s Societies, which lengthily-named con-
cern has “equal citizenship” as its war-cry, and is
affiliated with the International Women’s Suffrage
Alliance. Mrs. W. E. Nicholls is this State’s rep.
on the list of vice-presidents.
The School for Mothers has been taking stock of
a depressing balance-sheet, and appeals for funds.
Its certain income is. about £6O0 —£460-odd from
the Government and some municipal councils, the
balance from the Babies’ Hospital Association. Its
estimated expenses for the year are anything up to
£l9OO, and there is an overdraft of £222 on the
Central School property. Few social agencies do
better and more practical work than the school, or
make less fuss about it; and it deserves something
better than this. -
The Elder Hall hung out its “house-full” sign for
the Conservatorium’s first concert. Students were
the sole performers, but their work has got to a
high level —notably that of two youthful violinists,
Aila /even and Helena Fisher.
A Society’ woman created a sensation at the
Theatre Royal on the opening night of “Firefly” as
she entered the reserve stalls in a black sheath-like
garment that began at the waist and finished at
the knees, with flesh-colored hose to accentuate the
effect. Loud notes of exclamation brought the gal-
lery to its feet, and amid the excitement the lady s
escort hastily wrapped his woollen scarf round her
shoulders —and then apparently prayed for early
death or an earthquake.
Gent.-help Houston-Boswall has gone over to

An old colonist has passed out in Mrs. G. F.
Hussey. She was 93 when the call came, and
arrived in S.A. in 1848 in the Forfarshire. An
early Governor, Sir Henry Edward Fox Young, and
his wife were on the same boat, and Mrs. Hussey,
then Miss Tidmarsh, stayed at Govt. House until
her marriage. The late W. H. Hussey, a well-known
sharebroker, was a son. Two others, G.F. and F.
Hussey, and one daughter, Mrs. J. B. Cooke, survive.
Clara Serena, our leading contralto, who was
trained in Europe at the expense of a small local
syndicate, has since married Roy Mellish, musician
and conductor. The pair start for England at the
end of April, and meantime are visiting Queens-
land, where Mellish is to be - adjudicator in the
musical section of the Eisteddfod at Maryborough.


Rexona.
MISS FLORENCE ROBERTSON
(From a photo,)
“After having been ander medical treat-
ment for nearly 12 months for Eczema on
my head; I gave Rexona a trial, and in
six weeks my head was cured.
“(Miss) FLORENCE ROBERTSON,
“Kaiapoi, Claremont Street, Campsie,
“N.S.W.”
Never a day passes but that Rexona scores another
triumph over those serious troubles of life—Sores, Bad
Legs, Piles, Eczema, Pimples, Blotches, Burns, Nasal
Catarrh and Rheumatism.
The dainty little triangular pot of Rexona, the Rapid
Healer,. contains a combination of the most curative,
antiseptic, soothing and healing properties known to
science. Rexona is the Skin Remedy of the Age, because
it destroys the harmful germs that may be present in
a sore, pimple or any abrasion of the skin, thus preventing
any contagion of the blood, and at the same time causes
a new, healthy skin to grow.
REXONA immediately reduces the inflammation and
pain; it acts as a distinct stimulant to the pores of the
skin, and sets up a healing action immediately that
increases day by day.
Bad leg sores that have resisted every other
treatment succumb almost immediately to the
wonderful influence of Rexona, while for Piles
there is nothing its equal.
Rexona, Best for Bad Legs,
Eczema, Piles and Ringworm.
v*n. U afford to take chances with any of these serious troubles.
What you want is a really reliable remedy which is easily applied and
can be depended upon to heal quickly. Rexona fills this need. There
is no better treatment than to get a tin of Rexona and apply this
antiseptic healer night and morning. First wash the parts affected with
warm water and Rexona Medicated Soap, and then apply a little
Rexona, binding with a soft cloth when possible.
Rexona is a specially-prepared product, made especially to overcome
such serious troubles as these. Those who use Rexona will not be
disappointed, for Rexona heals quickly and absolutely.
Rexona Heals Rashes, Sores
and all Skin Eruptions.
Sometimes when you are at your wits’ end and feel that your efforts
are a failure, a friend can make the right suggestion and pull you
through. Obstinate sores of long standing reduce some unfortunate
sufferers to despair.
Remedy after remedy fails, and it seems nothing will help.
Rut you cannot have tried Rexona, for Rexona is always reliable. All
sores should be cleansed once or twice a day with warm water and
Rexona Soap.
Rexona Medicated Soap destroys germs and encourages the skin to
healthy action. Then apply a dressing of Rexona, the Rapid Healer.
Inflammation will quickly subside, healthy new skin will form, and the
body begin to build up new flesh again. You have not given yourself
a fair chance until you have tried Rexona Soap and Rexona Ointment.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
ROGER
&
GALLET
Perfurnes
Soaps
Powders
To a woman the most interesting part of
the show that the Institute of Architects
has draped about the Education Gallery is
that dealing with homes. In this section
there are fascinating sketches and photo-
graphs of brick and mortar shaped into pre-
tentious residence and irresistible cottage,
set down in corners of gardens where the
flowers bloom, and where vines and trees
flicker a lace work of shadow across porch
or verandah. There are straight-fronted
houses that wear their roofs low and some-
how suggest a dress of Quaker grey with
demure frilling. The array of North Shore
line homes would lure the most economi-
cally-independent female into matrimony,
while the designs for the Wynne home on
delectable Mount Wilson are a temptation
to the sixth of the seven deadly sins. The
Hardy Wilson and Keith Harris war mem-
orials are full of a quiet dignity; and the
competitive design by John D. Moore, which
just missed being chosen for Dunedin
(M.L.), would have been strikingly suitable
to the bleak sunlight of that hill-belted town.
Some forceful sculpture by Eva Benson and
G. Pillig fill odd corners, while art furniture
and rugs soften the austerity of the im-
mense tomes on the building art which the
Public Library has loaned to the exhibition.
The show, which is a free one, was unlocked
the other afternoon by the eloquence of the
Institute’s president, G. H. Godsell: and
later on the clatter of teacups contested with
the music of Bryce Carter and Roy Mackey
and came out about fifty-fifty.
Never before in Sydney was there such a
collection of black coats as the Chapter
House at St. Andrew’s wardrobed last week.
There were archbishops and bishops and
deans and canons; and in front of them
and flanking them moderators and presi-
dents and chairmen of the Scots’ Church
and the Methodists and the Independ-
ents, who have forgotten their old name
and now call themselves always Con-
gregationalists. Dr. Wright, Metropoli-
tan of Sydney. tucked ,his gaiters
beneath the president’s chair, and Gilbert
White, who in his time has been bishop of
half of Australia, put forward the plea of
the Lambeth Conference for church union.
The conference didn’t waste much time talk-
ing generalities it got to the difficulties
straight away—one of them branded Episco-
pacy, another Ordination. Of course, the
difficulties weren’t overcome. But some admis-
sions were made that sent the gentle descen-
dant of the gentle naturalist of Selborne
back to Willoclira very hopeful—as, for in-
stance, that of the Methodists that a bishop’s
apron wouldn’t frighten them: the Ameri-
can Methodists had bishops already. And
the Anglicans were just as conciliatory. Only
the Independents seemed to go away doubt-
ing whether the gulf between their ideas
of church government and some of the other
people’s could ever be bridged.
Society encourages the Bush Book Club-
Government House has set its seal upon it,
and has thereby secured for it the strong
support of the motoring suburbs. No
wonder then that Gregan McMahon s
presentation of “Quinneys” at the Play-
house, in the interests of the Club’s _ funds,
was greeted on each of the three evenings by
a packed theatre. The first-night audience
was the swankiest, because Dame Margaret
and Himself were front-seaters. Indeed, in
its enthusiasm to prove that the patrons
were as advertised the committee had placed
the vice-regal seats across the centre aisle in
the full current of any draught that might
blow up the bandbox of a theatre. Her Ex.,
who had the D’Apice couple and Miss
Henderson in her party, wore a dress all
green brocade and lace drapings. Knoxes
were there in strong contingents; Mrs.
Toohey and Miss Egan were other half-
guinea seaters; Mrs. Alec Gordon covered
her shoulders with the sweetest thing in gold-
tissue matinee coats. Bea McDonald’s
mother watched her Sarah Siddons as the
emotional Mabel Dredge; while Rossy Lums-
daine’s mother sat in the same seat every
night to applaud her chick, who was the
Posy Quinney of the production. A band
of girls under cyclonic Mrs. Albert Little-
john sold sweets and programmes every
night and realised a respectable £4O. The
cast suffered from a lamentable lack of
adipose tissue; and one man was heard
referring to the play as “Skinneys.” Though
in the best seats he was obviously not in
the best sets.
Artist Mary Edwards and her mother,
who left Sydney for Colombo early in the
year, were among the 500 non-official guests
at the Prince’s Durbar at Delhi. In Bom-
bay they linked up with some Christian
Science friends, who handed them on to a
mayor, who got them cards to everything.
They sat among the mighty, and were so
near to the Prince at the Durbar that they
became infected with his obvious nervous-
ness. The poor young man, aloft in a gold
chair, fidgeted with his collar and his sword,
and almost reduced the MS. of his speech to
pulp. He has, they report, lost all of his
beautiful Teddy Woodbine smile. The garden
party following the Durbar was held in the
Fort, where stands one of the most beauti-
ful buildings in the world —a dream of rich
white marble pavilions. Through this
scene passed and repassed 52 native princes,
their magnificent brocades hung with ropes
of pearls and strings of diamonds, with
retinues scarcely less gorgeous. Fierce sun-
light gleamed on Oriental costumes that were
a fantasy in color, on the Viceroy’s gold-
emblazoned staff, on Edward’s own staff
dressed in their best, on Poiret gowns
and Paquin hats; for India’s white
woman dressed without sparing to meet
her Prince, knowing how talk of the
glories filter through to the bazaars.
But when night fell the two Sydneyites
lost their breath completely, for instantly
the place .sprang into a blaze of light. Tens
of thousands of colored electrics turned
every shrub iiito a glorified Christmas tree.
Every ornamental lake and pond was out-
lined, and on these floated big lotus flowers
with colored lights in their cups, while the
pavilions bathed in an incandescent sea.
In balancing his yearly account the Stork
never finds a debit balance under the name
of St. Margaret’s Hospital for Women. The
Bourke-street birthplace has brought babies
into Australia for many years on the C.O.D.
plan, never drifting into debt; but now there
is a pressing need of expansion, and every-
body feels that something extra must be done.
A female committee a few weeks ago decided
on, first, a musical matinee at King’s Cross,
followed by a cretonne dance at the Went-
worth. When president of the Board Donald
Burke called his forces together over the
teacups in the Australia the other afternoon
he found the money spiders spinning beauti-
fully. Nearly-member-of-Parliament Mrs.
Wilson has captured a benefit from Wirtlis’
Circus in her net, and George Fuller’s tall
lady is organising a jumble sale in Paddy’s
Markets. The Hospital, incidentally, is non-
sectarian.
This photo shows that violinist Ernest
Toy still looks just as pleasantly on worldy
affairs as he did in
the days of the Paul
Du fault tours and
the Melba Opera Co.
Toy, who was born
at Bendigo and
brought up at Char-
ters Towers, is back
in Australia, mainly
for a holiday and to
introduce his ’Mur-
can wife to his
native heath. She,
too, is a clever musi-
cian, and the pair
have concertised in
the States unceas-
ingly for three years,
and are going back
a few weeks hence
to fulfil another two-
years’ booking. Ernest, whose speech has
developed a sharply-defined American twang
though his fiddle-tone is still good, avers
that “getting ahead” is easier there than
here. There was a special recital in honor
of the little violinist and his wife at the
Melbourne Music Glub the other day, and
now the pair are fulfilling an engagement m
Brisbane before putting m a brief spell m
Sydney.
The underworld of the State is thrilled
with an excitement such as happens only
once a year, and that at Easter time. From
the Northern Rivers to Albury the vibrations
tingle, and every turnip nearly bursts his
jacket in the determination to be the prize
turnip that his district sends to the Show.
This year is the R.A.S.’s centenary, and the
reminiscing that is going on in the vegetable
kingdom would make secretary Monty Somer
blush for his own weak powers of lying.
What the Onion that five years ago visited
the Show tells about the beauty and delicacy
of the salad ingredients of his day is only
surpassed by the monster Melon’s recollec-
tions of the glory of squashes when he was
their prize brother 50 years agone. The
special marking of the centenary is in the
hands of the school kiddies. For four days
the ring is to be gladdened by a procession
of youngsters, each group dressed in some
of the varied fashions of the past one hun-
dred years.
The Royal Welfare Society is running a
monster tea-tent at the Show this year in
the interests of Baby. Mrs. Redmond Barry
and a flutter of junior Red Crossers will
be the Hebes of the tea-leaf, while in the
compound around the tent will be a num-
ber of interesting displays of the bending of
the twie in the way it should grow. Mayor-
ess MclMhone rounded up the committee of
the enterprise in her room at the Town Hall
last week, and having wheedled them with
refreshments proceeded to extract their ideas
of a campaign, and then fastened the pieces
together with suggestions from everybody
present. Dr. Grace Boelke, Sister MacCal-
lum, Mrs. Aubrey Withers and kindergartener
Miss Desailly threw in some commonsense
remarks, which were supported by Ruth
Beale. Organising-secretary Margaret Moore
was unruffled and decisive. The question of
whether to pay the wash-up lady each day
or to present her with the accumulated mil-
lions at the end of the Show gave the meet-
ing much food for thought, but about 5
o’clock perfect Peace took possession.
This is the latest picture of Ena Gregory,
one of Manly’s prettiest girls, who is steadily
progressing towards
stardom on the silver
sheet in the U.S.A.
Ena will be remem-
bered as playing a
tiny part in “Eyes
of Youth.” At any
rate, if she didn’t
make a lasting im-
pression on your
mind she did on
E m e 1 i e Polini’s.
Emelie made search-

Sydney’s cheap shopping centre caught
glimpses of the best fashions in millinery
last Friday afternoon, w T hen a procession
of well-dressed women surged into the Reper-
tory Club rooms in Ellzabeth-street. Cul-
ture was “at home” for the first time this
season, the hostesses being Justice Gordon’s
little wife, neatly striped in black and white ;
Mrs. Vernon Cole, with a bird of paradise
on a black-satin hat; and Mrs. Arthur Mills,
who wore navy taffeta picked out with rust
shade. By 4 o’clock the long room was tor-
pid, and the decorative dahlias and gum-tips
failed to convey the cool breath of autumn
that their coloring suggested. (To one who
comes from a cold country, somehow dahlias
and a touch of frost in the air are indis-
solubly linked.) Mrs. Ambrose Thompson
was in charge of an aviary of young things.
Dorothy Hopkins got in some good work
with her fiddle, and Essie Ackland s rich
notes caught the ear. Mrs. Philip Morton
drooped about the room in rich black frock-
ing that showed the new length; Mrs. Hol-
man was there uncaring about brands ot
politics; tall Miss Roseby, of Kambala,_ was
exquisitely tailored in fawn, while her sister,
newly returned from browsing amid educa-
tional systems in London, nearly melted in-
side her thin navy silk.
Make a note on your ivory tablets: St.
Vincent’s ball, Easter Tuesday, Town Hall.
One hundred dozen roses are being made by
the committee to sparkle among the decora-
tions, which the J. C. Williamson firm is
designing and erecting. The gallery attrac-
tions are in the hands of untiring Josephine
Marks, who has thought out a pageant of
living pictures of World Masters. Singer
Julia Caroli is to wear the trappings of
“The Duchess of Devonshire,” Tootles Wil-
liamson will probably act “Fidelity,” Rock
Phillips will be “The Doctor” of the famous
Fildes picture, and the pretty little d£bs
will be grouped to illustrate Youth and
Beauty.
Queenslander W. Beith, who was almost
as well known'in Sydney as in Toowoomba
and Brisbane, died early last week in Hono-
lulu on his wav to England, where his wife
and daughter Toto have been for some time.
Mr. Beith had just paid a flying visit to Aus-
tralia to look after liis affairs here, and was
on his way back to rejoin his family. Mrs.
Beith, who had been advised of her hus-
band’s illness, reached Honolulu two days
after his death. Mr. Beith was financially
and otherwise interested in the fashionable
studio that trades under Bernice Agar s
name, and among his latest plans was one
to transfer the two clever Queensland sisters
who run the studio to Bond-street, London.
He was quite satisfied that operator Bernice
would have created something of a not m
English Society and Fashion.
Billy Beith had a genius for the stage
which’he employed to good purpose during
the war. He was behind most of the suc-
cessful entertainments that were got up for
the bored troops in and around Cairo in
1915-16. His two daughters, Charpnan and
Toto, inherited his gifts and are notable
dancers.
The Ballarat, which is an all-one-class
ship, gave a luncheon-party last week
at which Lady Loughborough, Phyllis Mac-
arthur, Colonel Eyrie, Colonel Osborne and
others were shown the considerable amount
of comfort that can be provided even in these
profiteering times at £45 a passage. \al
Osborne is going to England on the big
ship under the wing of Miss Marion street.
Lady Loughborough, by the way, says the
Melbourne report that she has helped to
make a film-picture and is turning her
thoughts seriously that way is quite untrue.
Old boys and scholars of Sydney -Grammar
took lady friends to the opening of the new
rowing-club shed on the Parramatta at
Gladesville on Saturday. It is near George
Towns’s famous camp, and within a coo.-ee
of North Shore Grammar’s new training
quarters. Justice Street having spoken a tew
nice things, the wife of Grammar s sports-
master, Hyam Marks, cut the
ribbon and the chattering. began. Later in
the afternoon the new racing eight-oar shell,
given by T. Peters, was baptised W. H.
Savigny” as a tribute to the veteran master
and coach.
His Ex. and Dame Margaret will return
to town from Sutton Forest on April 10.
The . Governor of Victoria and Countess
Stradbroke are motoring from Melbourne to
be their guests for the Easter festivities.
Lady Newdegate passed through Sydney
on Saturday on her way to M.L. She tours
the Dominion before returning to England.
An interesting corner in the . Bertram
Stevens Memorial Exhibition which Dame
Nellie Melba opened at Gayfield Shaw s new
gallery—The Attic, in Callaghan House—
is given oyer to the collection of black-and-
whites supplied by lavish-handed Howard
Hinton. From his cherished collection Mr.
Hinton has taken 14 drawings covering
black-and-white art between 1886, when
Phil May waves a cheerio from his At
Coogee,” and 1915, when Norman Lindsay
displays a “Study for Figure in Villon.”
Such Bulletin names as those of Hop,
Lambert, Mahony, Leist, Minns, Garliclc and
Hans Heysen greet the eyes of old friends
and capture the fancy of new admirers. The
corner is a memorial not only to Howard
Hinton’s affection for Bertram Stevens, but
to his affection for art in the years when
most well-to-do citizens regarded it as a
rather disreputable poor relation.
Graceful Ruby Adams has just gone into
mourning for her mother, who died late last
week. Mrs. Adams belonged to one of the
First Fleet families, and is closely related
to the Deloittes and Weigalls; and it is in
part from a French countess . grandmother
that Ruby inherits her distinction.
It will be a sad trip from Suva for young
Clive Joske, who travels up by the Niagara.
Clive had been expecting his father .down to
give him a spell from his job in their island
trading firm while he came to Sydney for
a round of gaieties. But the father died
suddenly on his 61st birthday—he had cele-
brated it by taking daughter Nell and his
niece to a theatre after a day at Rosehill.
Until the son’s arrival daughter Nell is prov-
ing the man of the family to the stricken
mother.
Warden Garnsey, of our St. Paul’s Uni-
versity College, has become engaged to Mrs.
Smairl, second daughter of Stafford Bird,
a former Treasurer (and many others things)
of Tasmania. The wedding will take place
at the end of August.
Amongst engagements in the Goulburn
district is that of Patricia Arnott, youngest
daughter of the town’s P.M., to Charles M.
Royds, of Caloola, Braidwood. The wed-
ding is fixed for Easter Saturday at St.
Saviour’s Cathedral.
Brenda Mitchell, treasurer of the fund for
the Memorial Fountain at the gates of the
’Loo wharf—it is to be unveiled on Anzac
Day by the G.-G. and Lady Forster —asks
the' collectors to write to her at 426 George,
street and let her know the amounts in hand
on March 31.
Mrs. Charles Regan, of Tamworth, with
daughters Kathleen and Mary and son Basil,
is leaving by the Niagara for America, and
thence the party goes on to England. Basil
will take the opportunity of studying up-
to-date milling methods (grain not fists) ;
Kathleen will take a flutter among the arts;
Mary will be expected to settle down to
three years of school life on the Continent.
The French still express filial sorrow on
the death of parents. Consul-General Cam-
pana’s wife heard last week of . the. death of
her father, Philippe de Suzzoni, director of
the Bank of France in far-off Bastia: there-
fore the cast of “Le Retour,” which the Alli-
ance is busy rehearsing, will lose her as
Colette Vandieres. Her part will be taken
by the newly-arrived Ilenriette Segaert.
AimCe Favenc explains that her mother,
whose death she is mourning, was not sent
by Farmer’s on a health trip to, Europe.
Mother and daughter bore all the expenses
of that journey out of money they had saved ;
but they appreciated to the full the compli-
ment Farmer’s paid their work in present-
ing them with a cheque for £lOO.

taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Dis Gusted: Afraid you’re wrong. Wild,
whirling charges, instead of doing any good, only
deepen the impression that there are no definite ones
to bring forward.... Bogong: You’re welcome....
Anon: It would wear out the best adze in the office
to get it passably smooth.... A.S.E.: Merit in it;
but it finishes too weakly. Try again.... Kupe: The
story wasn’t about old papers; it was about rare
ones.... 8.L.: Hardly, though something will have
to be said about it.. .Walter C.: For the sake of the
last rhyme we rush to rescue one of the verses sug-
gested by the M.L. nurseryman who told the confer-
ence of his craft that he could “live on the smell of
flowers”:—
Bring me not corned beef :<nd carrots,
Turtle soup or pickled pork,
Toasted quail or Maori parrots.
I have no use for knife or fork.
Take away that mushroom ketchup;
A bunch of violets to me fetch up.
... .Onoto: Don’t agree with you. .. .Alliance: The
drunk yarn wanted different handling... .Ernest C.:
It has a chance... .J.8.R.: Rather thin and over-
worked. .. .P.L.C.: Nothing in the little story to
make it worth telling. And do cheer up....1.G.
(Gladesville) : Not strong enough and falls down
badly on the last rhyme. ... X.R.M.0.: Off our beat.
... .H.R.M.: Sorry, but the girl is not improved. .. .
Bruce L.: Suffers from the sin of being very ordinary.
.. . James B.: A variation of an ancient yarn, and the
verse won’t carry it. .. .R.X.J.: None of them up. ...
Burrundie: You are waiting with a gun for a vague
and mysterious “Yellow Terror” —only that and
nothing more. ... S.S.S. (St. Kilda) : The verse
rumbles, bumps and slithers over its abstractions
until there isn’t an angle of its body that isn’t
bruised... .Jimmy B.: Not enough skill... .Z.V.B. :
The theme has been worked till it has got sore
shoulders, and some of the lines want upholstering,
too. .. . A.J.M.G.: Pretty, but slight; and there is
a false rhyme that spoils it. . . .Len L. R.: Faeble
little flutter. .. .K.J'.D.: The rhyme goes mad at the
third line. .. .Diogenes: They don’t find us in....
P.J.W.: No, thanks A.II. (Glen 0.): Why don't
you strike a note of your own ?.. . .C.P.T.: It just
trails off... . Carew: The dismal verse dies of its
own grief... .E.W.W.: Wanted better telling....
MistO: If it's going to be a lie let it be an artistic
one. .. .Chichester: Boot gag 01d.... Something
Illegible: “Origin of Art” has an idea or two; but
the composition is hopeless. .. . J.O’N.: Interest too
local. .. .J. 8.: That ’bus has turned the corner....
Pozzy: Nothing in the yarn; the verse is very
lumpy... .Jendi: You ask whether it’s worth while
going on. Well, unless you take the trouble to learn
how, it isn't. .. .1.H.G.: What lias Australia done to
deserve that ?.. . .Curfew: Locked out. . . .H.W.8.:
On the description it isn’t likely to answer ; but let
us see it.... Plodder: The “Magic” is not improved.
Put it aside for a while and try later on. . . .C.M.
(Grafton) : Hardly a possible theme after the handling
the subject has already received. Some of the verse
is wooden, some is short of grammar, some very
good. .. .A.S. (Upper Paddington) : The ideas are not
bad, but the verse i5....A.D. (Carlton): You’ve
made a good hash of unrelated commonplaces. .. .
Stoic: Not bad verse, but does not say anything
fresh. That form of octave is allowable, but not
g00d... .Territory Joe: The lines are a bit rugged
and rather tagged 0ut....R0m0: He’s a very unin-
teresting Bunvip. . . .F.S.G.: Too thin.... Don J.:
It hops along a well-beaten track, but not without
many stumbles.... Dorothy F.: Weak little flutter.
....Bob F.: Without interest or purpose. .. .Belle-
rive: “As the Years Doth Rolleth Onward” is little
short of a miracle:—
As the years doth rolleth onward,
Fame like gold has its rise and fall;
Time createth many changes,
There’s varied spans for the final call.
As the years doth rolleth onward,
Thousands grasp for the greed of wealth;
Wrongs and justice fiercely grapple,
Sufferers mourn their shattered health.
As the years doth rolleth onward,
Loved ones fadeth to their graves ;
While daily amidst the population,
Arriveth mothers’ welcome babes.
. ...F.A.N.: “Hush” is not a rhyme for “bush”....
Dinkum Oil: Try to strike an original note. All
that has been done dozens of times... .Marguerite:
The very word “Wanderlust” has become almost a
crime. It is now used only as a title for lazy
verses, and the last rhyme is always “roam”-
“home”...C. Serpent: Poisonous.. .W.E.8.: “Helen"
doesn’t make us believe it’s true.... Quentin P.: Two
must go back ; one has a chance... .P.A.L.: “Death’s
Footsteps” is the sort of yarn any good tradesman
can manufacture out of nothing. It holds only an
artificial horror... Berry: The romance that turns on
infant feeding didn’t stir a pulse.... Arthur P.: The
verse runs out of tune....F.H. (Adelaide): The
same old weep over the down-and-out, buried where
the bush' birds can sing to him.... Alan B.: Doesn’t
make much of a yarn. .. .1.M.D.: It is below the
standard.... Hannibal: The Alps beat you this time.
... .H.P. (Melb.) : Lacks interest... .George A.: The
“dawn”-“morn” dissonance in the first stanza!. .. .
P.J.1.: Very rugged. . . .Kenneth W.: The method and
matter are old and the workmanship a bit crude.
... .Fump-line: It staggered into the basket....
P.J.C.: Not up... .Jaeky-Jacky: The verse hasn't
enough in it.... J.J.0.: To rhyme only the first and
third lines of a stanza is to destroy the effect of
rhyme altogether... .James J.: It has an idea, but
the verse is too poor to carry it... .R.E.W.: Nothing
in it.... Y.Z.11: “The Problem” just misses; “In-
spiration” is shooed off the premises... . Helen B.:
“The Sea-Mood” won’t do. That metre ean’t carry
much thought W. J.: No Chinese would write like
that, and he wouldn’t be called Dam Dum either.
.<..A.D.: Misses.... Yancy: Looks like a tick, and
that was fully discussed a few months back. .. .D. 8.:
A venerable collection... .A.Z.: No sparkle in it.
A.J.P.: He spoke of “old Zulus” getting fat, and
so they do. ... Waiwetu: No “young guys” get in
here.... Ebb: Short weight. .. .J.W.: A lot of words
and little point... .K.D.8.: Not worth it.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
TI.McD.: No indication of genius in these sketches;
but let him be taught and see what happens....
A.F.L.: Not up M.F.: Let off as a first offender.
. ...H.E.R.: Very wobbly; may use one as a sugges-
tion Buneru: You’ve a long road to travel
L.W.M.: 0ut....G.H.: Nothing impressive about two
wooden females staring at each other,.... L.W.: No-
thing in it.

As a perfect blood purifier Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills have a
world-wide repuiation, and thousands of instances
are on record of their efficacy to overcome blood
disorders. Pimples, boils and blotches are signs of
impure blood, which should not be neglected.
When the blood is in an unhealthy state other
ailments are more or less present, for unless the
blood is pure it is lacking in that energy by which
the organs of the body perform their functions.
External remedies, powders, ointments, lotions,
only alleviate; they do not get at the cause.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills get at the cause by
removing the disease from the blood. They cleanse
the system by stimulating the liver and strengthen-
ing the kidneys, which filter the blood and throw off
the impure matter through the regular channels.

Miss WINNIE TATE PRAISES
Dr. SHELDON’S MAGNETIC LINIMENT
Miss
WINNIE
TATE
(.from a
Photo).
,
it
“I have been using your Dr.
Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment now
for over two years, and I am sure
I could never perform my work
without the help of Magnetic Lini-
ment. A rub with Magnetic
Liniment after strenuous dancing
makes all the difference in the
world, for it takes away the tired-
ness and strain, and leaves me
quite as fresh as ever.
“You cannot imagine what a lot
of uses I find for Magnetic, Lini-
ment. I have used it for Tooth-
ache, Headache, Neuralgia, aqd
for a rub-down after swimming,
and in every instance it has proved
most effective. I can assure you
that Magnetic Liniment will
always have a place on my Dress-
ing Table or in miy Travelling
Bag, and I never lose an Oppor-
tunity of recommending it to my
friends.
“Gratefully yours,
“(Sgd.) WINNIE TATE.”
Dr. SHELDON’S MAGNETIC LINIMENT
BANISHES ALL PAIN.
Pain in any form, be it Neuralgia, Rheumatism or
Sore Muscles; that pain if you so much as move —all
these pains and more are easily controlled by Dr.
Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment. Not an internal remedy,
but working through the pores of the skin.
Dr. Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment penetrates—goes
into the seat of pain, and banishment is the result. Apply
the Liniment with the palm of the hand—rub until the

A Song of Singapore.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
wind that blows through Sunda
Strait
Is soft as silk, and sure as Fate,
Or Love, in Singapura,
When batswing sail and stiff bamboo
Come home with cloth and iron too,
From far Malacca and Cheefoo,
To busy Singapura.
A painted queen of Asian trade,
A panting, paiiid, slant-eyed jade,
This Mecca of Malaya ;
But Yellow, White and Black and Brown,
They twang the harps of her renown,
From Hell to Sourabaya.
The trading men of seven seas
Send down their iron argosies,
And at her doorways thunder
Cor rice and rubber, spice and tin.
For blood stained silks of old Pekin,
And pearl and precious plunder.
With mat-sail or with spinning screw,
By junk or dhow or swift prahu,
With gifts and guilders golden,
They come, her eyes agleam, afire,
With tropic passion and desire,
Their wooing to embolden.
In blue kimono, red sarong,
She sings her sinful siren song,
Oh, hey-yah, Singapura!
Wp’ll laze beneath the palm-trees green,
To love and eat the mangosteen,
Ah, hi-yah, Singapura!
So, Europe’s leman, Asia’s bride,
Thy doors of Joy are opened wide,
In offers bold, audacious,
Where ladies fair of ev’ry birth,
In ev’ry jargon known on earth,
Give welcomes warm and gracious.
The Austrian blonde, the French brunette,
Mimosa San and Dutch Minette,
Frail daughters of perdition,
Vie with the girls of China seas,
With Tamils, Gyps and Javanese
In tainted competition.
Here Siva reigns. In mosques Malay
Swart pagans unto Allah pray;
And heathen supplications
Go up to Asian gods from shrine
And temple dark, where dimly shine
The altar-lights of nations.
Here have strange gods in one dish blent
Fruits, meats and spices Orient
To make a tropic curry ;
In one o’er-lieated human stew
Set Good and Evil, Old and New
A-boiling in a hurry.
’Neath red-tiled roofs, by deadly drains,
Through nights of Hades, steaming rains,
Goes on the constant jargon
Of Tamil, Arab, Dutch, Chinese,
Malayan, English, Japanese,
In gossip, fight and bargain.
The rickshaws come, the gharries go;
The traincar and the ox-cart slow
Bring West and East together:
The ayah knows how hang the lives
Of stout Dutch fraus and English wives
On rickshaw rides—and weather.
Shall West prevail? The moon-eyed East
Has flourished, fattened and increased ;
The West grows worn and jaded;
But tida apa Tuan, to-day,
To-morrow pass, in turn away—
Soon are the roses faded!
The wind that blows in Sunda Strait
Is soft as love and sure as Fate— •
Sing hey ! for Singapura !
A China junk with painted eye
And grinning crew goes rolling by ;
And ’neath the hillsides of Johore
Sne calls her magic from the shore,
This siren, Singapura.
VICTOKIA.

The Heart and the Rubicon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FRANK PORTER lunched with
Walter Rossiter. At a table very
near to them—very near by reason of
the, mobbed lunchers—sat two men who
could not escape notice: a dark, lithe, small
man with a ready smile and compelling eyes,
and a fair, dark, between-colors sort of man.
The dark little man laughed too loudly at
times to be all sincere at all times; but he
was human, there was a heart to him, and,
therefore, a brain. The other was his master,
for with half the ability he had no heart
at all-
The dark little man ate and laughed, and
the other wolfed and preached; and at long
last they went away and left an empty stage
open to explanations.
, “Know them?” asked Walter Rossiter.
I thought you didn’t. One is Eric Gold-
smith. the other John Tobias, otherwise Wil-
liam Church.”
“Goldsmith, the company promoter? Said
to Jie swift, isn’t he?”
“Yes, but I’ll back him, because he’s got
a heart, a good eye and he’s a man who
.can laugh. Impulsive, too—a hasty man
ls ,?®y. er a traitor. But the other”-
* <( Who is he?”
~, Ex-parson, English. He is now William
Church, company promoter, offsider to Gold-
smith; but he is John Tobias. Or it may
be the other way round.”
Walter?” nt ke him on face-value,
That a bit, but I’ve got knowledge too. I
had one deal with them—only one. But
that was enough for one life. They’ve

was engaged afterwards to report on
Territory cattle country for them, and had
the Devil s own job to get any pay from
Goldsmith at the last. And there was Gold-
smith, businesslike and quick, dealing with
men and m the next office Church telling
a tale to the poor old women to get their
bit from the savings bank; and then—the
dirty dog! down on his marrow-bones like
a kangaroo praying with the poor old dupes
tor the success of their investment!”
* * * *
Men began to speculate as to how
long Goldsmith could last. He changed
around from bank to bank, and oper-
and a dozen accounts, one against the
other. Everything he touched that once
had turned to gold turned to mud
;inud with a bad smell to it. A great
mine—-a world-beater of a mine— seemed
sure to save him; but something happened
and it went bad. Industrial companies
acquiring businesses which had been money-
spinners under individual control turned to
debits; pastoral companies suffered drought
on the runs and dry-rot in the office. Every-
thing went wrong. The whispers became
full-voiced; men who had trusted blindly
came back to demand settlement—came to
the office threatening and went away pla-
cated, some with money, some with pro-
mises some with pity. For the man re-
tamed his charm ; one client who had lent
Goldsmith £l5OO and called to demand it
and swore that he would not leave without
it, ended by lending another £5OO and giving
Goldsmith a big, fat, prosperous cigar. And
when he explained to them the explanations
were so frank and sounded so sincere that
most went away believing that he must pull
through, and that nothing could alter the
ultimate success of the man.
He must have carried a burden of terror
for months, for they did not know all. Only
l?ah ? ah jessed it. and that was Church •
and he, feeling that he was on a sinking
snip, proceeded the more energetically to
providoring- of a boat for his own escape.
Goldsmith in his office on the day that
JNemesis seemed nearer than ever before had
a visit from a man who had shaken him
where he lived. For this man had come to
say that a bill for a mere £390 was due
that day, and Goldsmith had thought it had
three days more to mature, And this man
came at two-thirty when Goldsmith had
thought he had lifted his day’s commitments
—the moving tent of credit that covered
him. The creditor had taken a cheque for
the bill, and then wouldn’t hand the bill
over until the cheque was met. And all the
day’s work had been done, Goldsmith thought,
and the necessity to struggle again made
him feel very old and very tired. It meant
a private source; he had closed all banks
until to-morrow, and to-morrow’s sheaf of
paper was waiting to be taken up.
That morning he had opened the door be-
tween his office and Church’s room, and
seeing that Church had a visitor—a thin,
work-worn, old woman, all skin and misery
—he had retreated, leaving the door not
quite closed. And then he heard this-
I wouldn’t like to lose it—only £29o—
the savings bank only gives per cent.,
Mr. Church. It’s very little, but it’s safe,
Mr. Church, and it’s all I have.”
“My dear lady,” said the gentle flute of
Church, “I couldn’t possibly advise you to
put money into this cement proposition if
I were not absolutely certain of its sound-
ness. It must pay 20 per cent, from the
beginning, and later on when the three units
of plant are working it should pay 50 per
cent. Now, looking at the proposition solely
from your point of view—looking at it as
your friend and adviser—it seems certain
to me that a return of 50 per cent.—£llo
a year—must be better for you than the
seven or eight pounds a year paid you by
the savings bank—a mere pittance.”
“If ycu do think it’s right, Mr. Church”—
I am absolutely certain it’s right.”
‘I could think it over and take some
advice.
“You’ll miss the opportunity. You see, I
can’t offer such a proposition as this to
everybody. As a matter of fact, the list
must close to-day”
Goldsmith smiled bitterly, knowing that
the list that must close to-day was the list
of a half-baked company registered with just
sufficient capital to legalise it—that all the
capital had been spent, and that the “cement
works” were on paper.
‘‘What a dog he is!” said Goldsmith.
“What a dog!”
The thin old woman spoke again, and as
if decided“ Then I’ll do it, Mr. Church.
I gave notice of withdrawal the other day
before I got a little fainthearted about the
—the investment, and I’ll bring along the
money this afternoon.”
“You have decided wisely,” said flute
voice again, as if he were Goodness itself
rewarding a child impossibly angelic.
“And I hope God’s blessing will be on it.”
That was Church’s cue, and Goldsmith,
after an interval filled with the pushing
back of a chair and a soft thud on the carpet,
knew that Church had answered it, and was
on his knees.
. “Let us ask the blessing of God on the
investment,” said Church and another chair
moved, and the investor was praying too.
“Oh, hell!” said Goldsmith, closing the
door, and sick with disgust. “The dog!”
And he went out to his work of inflating a
paper balloon to carry To-day over To-
morrow.
By half-past one he had done it; too weary
to eat he dragged himself back to his office
and heard, the chimes of 2 o’clock strike,
and felt the lifting of the load and ached
to hear 3 o’clock sound from the Post
Office tower, and know that all the day’s
demands were over. The four notes of the
quarter chimed, and the eight notes of the
half-hour; and then had arrived this man
with the bill for £390 which Goldsmith had
miscalculated as having three days more of
flight before it came home to roost. It
wasn’t a bill he could allow to go to protest
and lift with money next day. The endorse-
ment on the bill was his own ; the name of
the drawer—a name so big that one might
have wondered at its owner drawing a bill
at all—had been written by the hand of
the endorser. It was one of many promissory
notes—kites flown to last their little gale,
and then redeemed on their due date, and
others flown _in their stead —anything to
temper the wind until his ships came home
from sea. And here it had arrived when
overwrought nerve and jaded brain had let

YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE
No! Age does not explain the kidney weakness,
backache, muscular stiffness, rheumatic pains and urinary
discomfort of elderly people; for whilst some are young
at eighty others are old when only sixty.
But age does bring health-wisdom. Let the young folk
listen when old people say: "Keep cheerful, but never
keep late hours. Avoid heavy meals. Shun all excesses.
Take exercise. Get sufficient sleep."
Young and old alike will find Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills a ready help. This specially strength
ening kidney and bladder medicine does not disturb the stomach or bowels.
INTERESTING SYDNEY EVIDENCE.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. E. Mayhew, 48 Alexander Street, Alexandria, Sydney, says: I suffered
from backache and rheumatic pains all over my body, and was sometimes _so bad
that I was almost crippled. I could not stoop without enduring torture: m tact,
every movement meant increased suffering, and I often used to feel quite knocked
up. To make matters worse, my rest at night was disturbed and I was also
subiect to dizzy attacks. One day a friend heard Doan’s Backache Kidney 1 ills
verv well spoken of, so she advised me to try them. I bought a bottle without
delay, and after taking them for a few days my health began to improve, so I
persevered, and by the time I had used three bottles I was cured. The backache
and rheumatism have gone completely, and I feel splendid in every way.”
Four years later, Mrs. Mayhew says:—“Since giving my testimony for Doans
Backache Kidney Pills I have had a slight return of kidney trouble, but I again
used this fine remedy and it soon fixed me up. I strongly recommend Doan’s Pills
to all who suffer with their kidneys.”
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Jas. Wilson, 17 Little Buckingham Street, Sydney, says:—“For a long
time I suffered torture from backache and kidney trouble. The pains in my back
were very severe and I have been so bad that I could not attend to my work, as
every movement caused positive torture. The kidney secretions were affected,
being thick and cloudy and containing a red sediment. I was also subject to
dizzy feelings and could not sleep properly at night. Nothing I took gave me
any permanent relief, but one day, when I was feeling very bad, I heard good
reports of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so I sent for some, and after taking
seven bottles I was cured. This remedy not only banished the backache, but
strengthened and toned up my kidneys and improved my general health.”
Mr. Wilson confirms the above eight years later, and says:—“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills and always have a bottle in the
house. By taking them every now and again my kidneys keep in a healthy
state, and I am never troubled with backache.”

themselves relax, believing the day’s stress
over.
He told the creditor to bring the bill next
day, and the creditor, who had been fright-
ened and hated the cause of his fear, refused ;
and then just as the three-quarters chimed
Goldsmith offered him a cheque, paying To-
day with To-morrow. Anything to get that
bill. But the discounter said he would hold
the bill until the cheque was cleared; and
Goldsmith, afraid but weary, assented with
the imitation of a good grace, knowing
that time was fighting for him.
But, the discounter gone with bill and
cheque, fear assaulted the debtor. Only 10
minutes to 3 and no ordinary exchange
that day. But the discounter" might ask
for a special answer, and, finding the answer
bad. might go hot-foot to the drawer, and
find, in its turn, forgery ! Yet time was
against the discounter. Ten minutes to
3! Only 10 minutes to be safe. If
Goldsmith could find that little £390 he could
pay-in after hours, make all secure, prevent
the house of cards falling about him in black
irremediable ruin. Time for this, and then
time (for its fellows, and the sale of their mine
nearer, and money enough to last to pay
everybody, and be again the successful finan-
cier—--Goldsmith, the young, debonair genius
who could lead men and make millions!
“Iff I don’t get time I’ll get time,” said
Goldsmith, smiling bitterly to himself. “But
I’m too tired, and I’ll back the luck.”
The door between his office and Church’s
was: ojpen. Standing there waiting for/the
full chime and the stroke of 3, smiling
bitter])/ at his sick fancies and then checking
hims'ell' as he found his teeth involuntarily
biting; the fingers of a shaking hand, he be-
came iconscious that there was somebody
watelm g him. Looking directly at the door
to Chat cli’s office he saw there the thin, bent
figure oi f the little old woman whom Church
had prayed with that morning. Seeing her
he smifi d the old, winning smile, and was
his old, 1 courteous self again.
•“Anything I can attend to, madam?” he
said. 1
“Mr. Ohurch is out, sir,” said the thin
old woman, “and I must see him to-day to
get the « ment shares.”
lie ren lembered. “The cement shares!”
“Yes —5120. I have the money with me.
I’ve just taken it out of the savings bank.
He tells ;me you’re his partner, Mr. Gold-
smith.”
“Scarcely that. But we’re associated.”
“Then I can leave the money with you,
and you ca n give me a receipt for it. If I
don’t pay to-day I can’t get the shares, Mr.
Church say, s, as the list will close.”
The cliim es of the full hour began, and
Goldsmith’s thoughts leaped their way to
safety. To take the money, to pay it in, to
get tiie bank to pay the hundred and seventy
short for a day: to pay the discounter’s
cheque and -.save the note that was a crime.
It could be flone. He could be at the bank
before a quarter past three. It could be
done. But ‘he felt very tired, very weary
of struggling i against this interminable sea of
difficulty and danger. Yet—it was worth
it; with tire prize ahead—security and
respectability 1 ; safe as many big men hold-
ing up their heads in the city, but who had
often skated on thin ice and yet reached at
last the firm floe. Yes, it could be done,
and nobody the wiser.
And then he saw the hand that offered
him the bank notes —£220; and that was the
little woman’s ark and anchor. A pitifully .
thin hand it was, gnarled with work; broken
nails and stiffened fingers and hard blue
veins upon the back of it that told of thick-
ening of the arteries ; a hand pitifully help-
less. As if lie could not prevent himself
he took the notes, but made no movement
to his table to write the receipt—simply
took them and thought swiftly.
He could use the money now and repay
it later—next week —even to-morrow —any
time so that he could save himself to-day.
And then he looked at her hands again and
at her face that told of the long tragedy
of work and bitter loneliness—one old
woman against the world, and he about to
steal her only defence. It was unthinkable.
It would L>e crime the meanest and the
worst; a young man robbing an old woman
and in the doing of it falling lower than
the hypocrite who had prayed with her that
day.
The three strokes of doom sounded as
he thrust the notes back into her hand, and
closed her other hand upon it.
“You got this from the Savings Bank?
Take it back there—it’s the only safe place.
Don’t say ‘Cement’ to me. It’s a swindle.
We’re all swindlers here. Church is a crook
and so am I. Promise to take it back. Put
it in again to-day. Promise.”
“I was afraid all the time. It’s all I
have.”
“Promise me to take it back. No, I won’t
trust you. I’ll send a clerk with you. Never
listen to anybody who wants to take your
little savings. We’re all crooks —the world’s
crook, when it comes to deal with old women’s
money. I’ll get a clerk to go with you.”
He pressed the buzzer and a clerk came
to the call.
“Hyam,” said Goldsmith, take this lady
to the Savings Bank ; take a cab. Don’t let
anybody stop you. If you meet Church, don’t
let her talk to him. See that she re-deposits,
it. Clear out —you’ve only a few minutes.
Get to it. . . .And goodbye, Mother. . . .Good
luck. Take your safe three and a half, and
be content.”
The clerk preceded her, but she kept him
waiting outside the door to'return to Gold-
smith. He sat very weary again _at his
desk, the passing of his impulse having left
him cold.
“You’re a good man and a beautiful lad,”
said the old woman. “God bless you. I’ll
pray for you to-night.”
“Prayer!” said Goldsmith when she had
gone. “Hers can’t hurt me. But Church
will pray too—that’s hell!”
Truly enough Church came back to prey.
He came back an hour later sweating with
haste and chafing at delay.
“Did an old lady come to see me?” he said.
“Yes,” said Goldsmith. “She had £220
with her to invest in cement.”
“Well, did yon take it for me?”
“Cement!” repeated Goldsmith, his vo ; ce
made guttural with scorn. “That swindle
was dead last year. No, I didn’t take it,
damn you—l didn’t take it. I told her we
were all crooks here. I made her take it
back to the Savings Bank. And I sent Hyam
with her to see that no other fakir charmed
her out of it on the road.”
‘‘By God!” said Church. “I’ll get square
with you for that. You told her I was a
crook ?”
“I told her we were all crooks. God. man,
did you see her hands? When you said your
damned prayers, did you see her hands?”
•‘l’ll get square for that,” said Church —
“I’ll get square.”
“When you like, and you’ll get square
somewhere else. You’re too crook for a
crook like me. Clear out of this office for
keeps—you poison the air.”
Goldsmith, very old and weary, sat at his
table and dully waited for the reckoning
to-morrow. It came by (i o’clock that night
—a warrant sworn by the discounter, who had
asked for a special answer for the cheque,
and in its default had recourse on the bill,
and proved it a forgery at the first inquiry
of the alleged drawer.
The old woman prayed for Goldsmith be-
fore his sentence, that it might be light; and
after sentence, that he might have strength
to endure; and after the release, for his
rehabilitation. She knew the goodness of a
heart that knows its impassable Rubicon.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
A Good Save.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY wife, tfella, always holds that she
was responsible for our good fortune.
It’s at least certain that if her great-
aunt Martha hadn’t died at seventy-seven we
would not have gone to the city to attend
her funeral. And if we had not stayed for
the night with some cousins we would not
have attended the church bazaar. Also I
would not have paid 2s. for a ticket in an
art-union with a motor-car as first prize.
But we also would not have spent forty-five
shillings on one box of chocolates and a tea-
cosy.
When we returned to our suburban home
we found that Aunt Martha had left us her
canary and an iron bedstead. The next
week, however, I got a shock to get a letter
saying we had won the car.
For a time all went well and we both
learned to drive with a minimum of acci-
dents. But as I went on I found out the
: nerve-wracking duties that connect them-
selves to a car. And I found myself more
and more dragged from my novelistic studies
to manicure Suzette’s —as my wife named
the little thing—spark plugs. Then we were
seized with a passion for, accessories and
began to pore over catalogues and haunt
bargain-sales. By careful living I managed
to buy an automatic basket which, on being
attached to the rear axle, retrieved everything
we ran over and paid for itself in chickens
in about a week. With the aid of a Tento-
flat, which was attached to the running-
board, we were able to go for week-end
jaunts into the country with a two-room
apartment, twin beds, a kitchenette with
stove—attached to the exhaust—and a
shower-bath which utilised the hot water
from the radiator. . ,
One afternoon, while I w T as m town inves-
tigating the possibilities of an electric device,
my notice was attracted by a placard
EL liOPO MAGIC TABLETS.
Put Them in Your Petrol
and Sava 25 per cent.
The petrol problem having become acute I
decided to sample the tablets. Caieiully
measuring my petrol and noting the mileage,
I tore home and drove 143 times around the
block till I had completed ten measured
miles. During the week I compared statis-
tics with hypermeticulous precision, and was
overjoyed at finding that I had saved the
promised 25 per cent. : .
As 1 had been for some time considering
whether to purchase a Doodle-bat ladio-active
carburetter guaranteed to save 50 per cent,
petrol or money refunded and no questions
asked or answered, in the excitement of the
moment I bought it. _
Immediately after lunch Zella and I went
for a long run in the country for a labora-
tory test. We were transferred-to the seventh
heaven on returning to discover 75 per
cent, saving in our original petrol consump-
t> As w 7 e sat round the table I busied myself
opening the afternoon’s mail. The first was
a tailor’s bill. The next envelope I opened
contained an advertisement: Mr. Motorist.
I)o you want to save money on petrol. llien
attach our Squirto-steamo device to your
manifold. Besides eliminating carbon, and
preventing fatty degeneration of your cylin-
ders, this device positively saves 25 per cent,
of your petrol!’’
I couldn’t wait for breakfast next morning
to rush into town and have it attached. I
filled the tank to the brim and went for a
twenty-mile run before going home, lhen
I stopped, and with trembling hand and
beating heart proceeded to unscrew the cap
of the tank. The tank was still full! 1
had saved the last 25 per cent.
At my cry of joy Zella came running out,
carrying a parcel in her hand.
“Here are those multiple-fire volcanic
spark plugs you ordered three weeks ago,’
she said.
And then —I remember it as though it
were yesterday —I got the idea that was to
bring me a tidy little income.
“Zella,” I said huskily, “what are those
spark plugs guaranteed to do?”
“Why, a set will save 10 per cent, of your
petrol,” she answered.
Without a word. I seized the package, tore
off the wrappings, and, scarcely able to hold
a wrench in my hand,, proceeded to fit them on
in place of the old ones. Then I started the
engine. There was a minute’s paiise. Then
—could it lie? It could. The full tank
began to overflow. I had now Saved 110
per cent, of my petrol and was running on
10 per cent, less than nothing.
I must have fainted, for I remember
nothing until I found Zella pouring cold
water on me, and hysterically begging me to
stop the motor, which by now had created
a considerable pool of benzine in the street.

their ECONOMY IN RUNNlNG—which is pertinent to the times
—their DEPENDABILITY counts a great deal for their
popularity. Even under the most severe conditions thev can be
relied upon to give “CONSISTENT SERVICE.” Their strong
construction, and the great care taken in their manufacture is
the reason for this. Machines installed 25 years ago are still
at work to-day, giving the same service as when first installed.
We study your reuuirements and design the layout of your
plant, not only to accomplish a given result, but to do so with
an initial expenditure and maintenance cost. Our extensive
experience we place at your service.
