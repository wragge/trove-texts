“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly— Australla’s Nonparell
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
It the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy .
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction,
A new Parliamentary System—one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. *
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which |
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent |
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every i
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the ela’ms of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Ear North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

The Winner of the Squatters’ Cup.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Luck good ? Yes, pretty fairish now, the worst I
ever knew,
Came when I won—and lost—a race for Scott at
Wallaroo.
How’s that ? you say—well, if you like, I’ll try to
make it clear :
’Twas in the spring of Ninety, in the grand old Car-
bine’s year,
I rode Scott’s well-known Planet, and I didn’t
care a rap,
Bar Sheik, for all the entries in the Squatters’
Handicap.
(A fine, big bay like Planet was that Dick Delaney’s
Sheik,
A blooming muff had got the mount —Bill Long,
of Sandy Creek.)
’Twas over rails and water, too, the district’s
favourite race—
My word ! the Cup and Stakes were grand for
such a one-pub. place.
That year they’d capped the fences, but the
stewards most were proud
Of that deep, muddy water-jump they’d scooped
to please the crowd.
Down dropped the flag, and in the lead abreast
raced Bill and I;
Abreast we cleared the first three jumps. “Sheik!
Planet ! Sheik ! ’’ they cry.
Those mulga cappings on the “logs’’had pulled
the others up,
And one of us, the public knew, must win the
Squatters’ Cup ;
Justus I thought I’d be that one, there came a
sudden fear,
Bill’s prad was racing fresh and strong, while mine
rolled blooming queer :
And I cursed the keyless stables, way back there
in the bush.
They’d “ got at ” dear old Planet then, that blank
Delaney push.
No ! P’r’aps I’d better not explain, how with an
ugly thud,
We jostled at the water-jump, and fell in soupy
mud,
We lost our reins, and Bill got kicked, by what he
didn’t know,
(But when six pair of legs get mixed, a young ’un
gets a show).
We scrambled out two yellow jocks, each caught
a trailing rein.
We sprang on yellow horses, and we raced away
again;
“ Sheik ! Sheik ! ” they yell. Bill got the start,
they knew him by his hair
(Housed to sport a ragged “mo,” my face was
then quite bare).
My mount seemed freshened up a lot, he gained
at ev’ry stride.
And then there came another yell, “ Old Planet
wins !” they cried ;
Unheeded fell Bill’s cruel whip, I saw his prad
was done,
I passed his flanks, his girth, his head—the
Squatter’s Cup was won!
“You wretched fool,” said Scott to me (but not a
word I spoke—
I knew the boss’s larking ways—l thought I saw
his joke);
“ It’s no good my protesting, for you weighed in
both the same ”
(Just here I winked to let him know I twigged
his little game).
“You wretched fool,” said he, again, with more
dramatic force,
“You think you won ! Blank you, you did ! —on
Sheik, Delaney's horse!”

I is
With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take
what are vour peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS is,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where nractical bootmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply hfi patrons at the lowest cash price.
POST FREE TO ANY PART OP AUSTRALIA.
No matter how far in the interior you reside, ELLIS S
system has already proved a sovereign balm to thousands
of country residents who, whilst performing their daily
avocations, had previously to endure the excruciating
tortures of narrow-fitting and shapeless foot gear, the
insoles of which fairly bristle with tacks and other un-
comfortable impedimenta. All boots made on specially-
constructed lasts, giving the foot an ample tread,
and consequently comfort. You can WEAR ELLIS S
BOOTS STRAIGHT AWAY—they are a “going con-
cern ” from the start. The materials are well tanned, and
will not “draw” or blister the feet, as most new boots
do. Send for catalogue, post free. The following

SATURDAY, AUGUST 4, 1894.
Payment of Members.
The late New South Wales general election
was remarkable for many things, but most of
all for the multiplicity of candidates who
went to the polls. It was further remark-
able for the number of candidates who
wanted to go to the polls, but were induced,
under extreme pressure, to remain away.
Had all the aspirants tried their fortunes on
the day of election the total number of com-
petitors would not have been far short of
1000, and of this vast assemblage hardly
one remained away voluntarily ; those who
retired only did so because the central
authority of their party refused them its
support, and their chance was consequently
hopeless. Of all these seekers after legis-
lative “ honours ” it may safely be assumed
that an enormous proportion were actuated
exclusively by a desire for the salary which
goes along with the billet of M.L.A. ; their
numbers were so vastly in excess of those
who competed in the days of unpaid Legis-
latures that, even when the abolition of the
£4O deposit is duly regarded, the salary must
have been accountable for much of the differ-
ence. A considerable number also wanted the
position altogether irrespective of the salary,
but not being men of independent means
could not have held it had there been no
emoluments attached. And the balance
consisted partly of men who would have run
for Parliament had there been no payment,
but who will gladly accept the £3OO a year all
the same; and partly of men who would have
run for Parliament in any case, because
they make a dishonest income out of politics
and live on the game, and who will take
the £3OO per annum while it is going, but
would much rather it were not going, because
it brings too many competitors into the field
and thus renders their seats and their
swindles eminently precarious. There also
used to be one man—only one—who was
never suspected of dishonesty, and who
didn’t draw his salary, presumably through
conscientious motives, but as he has gone
out of New South Wales politics he need not
be included in this category.
• • •
In an Assembly thus constructed it is a
truly surprising circumstance that half,
if not more than half, the members
have announced themselves hostile to the
principle of payment of members. The
country was flooded with candidates, most
of them falling over each other in a frantic
rush to get £3OO per annum, and yet an
immense proportion of these professed to
want, above all things, the abolition of the
salary which they struggled so desperately to
secure. The community the dull, un-
thinking, unreasoning mass of humanity
which is always longing for some new
confidence-man to come along and take
it in—accepted their assurances as a solid
evidence of disinterestedness, and sent
them into Parliament accordingly, and they
gave the said assurances mainly because
they Avere a handy means of getting into
Parliament. Some 60 or 70 men now in the
Assembly arrived there—in part at least—
because they declared that they really and
truly wanted to toil at an exacting profession
for absolutely nothing ; to give up, either
wholly or in a great measure, the occupations
by which they make their living, and to get
no recompense AA T hatever ; to spend long
days and nights in weary debate ; to sit up to
the small hours of the morning keeping a
quorum for the benefit of their party, or
waiting for a division ; to snatch fitful spells
of unrefreshing slumber on the seats of the
House when they dared not go to bed lest
their votes should be Avanted at a moment’s
notice to save their bleeding country ; to be
abused by hostile newspapers and hostile
partisans ; to leave their homes, in many
instances, for six or eight months in the
year, and incur the heavy expense of living
in the metropolis—and all from unalloyed
patriotism, and with no desire for any return
whatever. To the man with no means, who
depends for his livelihood on his own exer-
tions, to be an unpaid member of Parlia-
ment —provided he doesn’t pay himself
by directly or indirectly looting the
Treasury —means a loss of at least £2OO per
annum. And Avhen 300 or 400 struggling
men will be found to voluntarily contribute,
out of their own narrow means, £2OO each
per annum to aid the Treasury when it is in
an unusually tight place, then the 300 or
400 politicians who lately professed a desire
to serve their country gratis will be genuine
—and not till then.
* * *
The reason why so many of the “ leading”
politicians have declared for a return to the
old fraudulent system is sufficiently obvious.
Until payment of members was introduced,
these individuals held office (at £l5OO a year)
turn about, and thus realised an average
salary of £750 per annum. Also, they en-
joyed, turn about, the command of vast
political patronage, which enabled them to
provide for their friends and relatives, and
to do many other things which were in-
directly worth, to an honest Minister, at
least as much as his salary, and, to a dis-
honest one, perhaps ten times as much. The
£3OO a year is very little as compared to these
privileges, and yet that honorarium has helped
into existence a third party which may, at
no distant date, snatch them all away.
Those of the rank-and-file of the old parties
who lived by straight and unadulterated
fraud, by using their Parliamentary position
to compass mysterious land-swindles, to get
roads and railways made through their
private estates, or to manipulate concessions
for syndicates and companies, who hired out
their names to shady joint-stock enterprises,
or took direct bribes for services rendered,
also lose by the present arrangement. So
do the softgoodsmen who go into Parliament
to see that no duties are levied on their
imported calico, and the brewers who go
there to vote against the beer-tax, and the
landlords who go there to vote against the
land-tax. The honorarium is very little com-
pared to the incomes which intelligent politi-
cians used to make by underhand devices ;
yet the rush of candidates which it induces
has already lost many of them their seats,
and promises to wreck most of the survivors
at a future date. Therefore, the sur-
vivors are against payment of members
almost to a man. And, as already men-
tioned, many of the new members profess
to be against it, because a dull and stupid
community was ready to take their profes-
sion as a proof of patriotism and disinter-
estedness. It was, therefore, good policy to
so profess, and they professed accordingly,
with a firm conviction that a kindly majority
would prevent the disaster ever coming to
pass.
• * •
Crick, M.L.A., the Tshmael of the Assem-
bly, now proposes to put these individuals to
the proof by moving for the immediate
abolition of the honorarium. He will be
supported by most of the old-established
Parliamentary robbers who find it more
profitable to pay themselves than be paid.
He Avill also be supported by sundry mem-
bers who don’t know how to pay themselves,
and whose very food and raiment depend on
their salaries, but who will join him to save
their credit with their constituents and in the
hope that the proposal will be lost, despite
their reluctant support. And it is just pos-
sible that too many of this latter class will
try to save their reputations for consistency
by voting against what they fondly trust is
a foregone conclusion, and may carry their
point against their will and to their own
destruction. Then the Council will gladly and
enthusiastically endorse their action, and the
good old days will come back, when none but
capitalists and thieves were qualified for
seats in the Assembly. The Labour-party is
the only one which can be relied upon to
give a solid vote on behalf of the present
system. Its members hold no portfolios,
get no fees as members of the Public Works
Committee, and have no present prospect of
any salaried billets from either party ; also,
they have no private estates to be improved
at the public expense, and, being watched by
both old parties, and by the capitalistic press,
and the L.E.L., have practically no chance
of “living on the game” in any underhand
sense. To them payment is a necessity, so
long as man requires food and is not allowed
to go round in a state of complete undress,
and they frankly admit the fact. Those
other members who do not admit the fact
either live on Ministerial salaries, or else are
wealthy capitalists who go into Parliament
mainly to see that the burden of taxation is
not shifted on to their own class, or else who
make their board and clothes out of their
Parliamentary positions in ways which won’t
bear inspection.
# * #
The one indubitable fact that stares the
community in the face is that no man works
gratis. Nobody ever offers to be a civil
servant for nothing, or to be a clerk for
nothing, or to be an artisan, or a physician,
or a monarch, or a Cabinet Minister without
pay, or to dig, or herd cattle, or hump bales
and boxes on a wharf, without remuneration
in any shape. If he did he would be inevit-
ably set down as a lunatic or a disguised
thief. Yet when hordes of politicians—
mostly hard, money-making men who were
never known in all their previous lives to
sacrifice cash for sentiment, or do anything
for nothing—profess themselves ready and
anxious to give up their time to the
exacting toil of looking after the public
interests, and to do it honestly and for no
ulterior motive, and not only to have no
desire for remuneration, but to be anxious
to pay large sums in election expenses for
the privilege of doing it, a very large
section of the community is willing to
take them at their word. ! The circum-
stance is incredible beyond the power of
words, but it exists none the less. Under
the present policy the great majority of can-
didates are mercenary individuals actuated
by a desire for the salary alone. In this
respect they are like everybody else in all
this world ; everybody who wants a billet of
any kind is a mercenary individual looking
after the salary. And, having got his billet,
the candidate who lives on his salary does
his best to fulfil the wishes and to promote
the interests of his employers—the nation—
in order that he may keep his billet and his
salary, in which respect he is like every other
servant, from a Permanent Under-Secretary
down to the cook in a sixpenny restaurant.
The stereotyped complaint that paid poli-
ticians are low and degraded because they
work mainly for their wages is just as absurd
as the complaint that labourers are mer-
cenary because they don’t dig the ground
gratis and from purely patriotic motives. If
the world can’t find monarchs, Cabinet
Ministers, clergymen, physicians, lawyers,
hangmen, and editors to toil without pay, it
need not expect to find politicians to do so
either. Also, it would be a lamentable thing
if it did find them. The man who offers to
take care of the national assets without
salary is just about 200 times more to be
suspected than the man who offers to manage
a bank gratis and to pay for the privilege of
doing so. The idea of a Parliament of pure,
disinterested and able patriots, serving for
the mere sake of patriotism, is magnificent
in theory ; but it is only theory. Such men
exist in all ages and in all countries, but no
small community ever grows or ever did
grow or ever will grow 125 of them at once.
Also, most of them have to toil for their
daily bread and cannot give up their lives to
legislation ; and even if they did exist and
were all men of independent means their
chance of being discovered and sent into the
Legislature is infinitesimal. The country
only finds out the true and disinterested
patriot when he advertises himself, and the
fact of his advertising is sufficient evidence
that he is no patriot, after all.
State Life Assurance.
Every now and then some audacious M.P.
dares to raise his impious voice in one of the
Australian legislatures to call attention to the
necessity that exists for regulating the business
of life assurance. Little good ever comes of
these spasmodic attempts to deal with a vital
question, and the cry of the complainer is
speedily drowned by the protests of the smug
crowd who have captured the directorates of
life-companies, against State interference with
this, the most sacred of all forms of “ private
enterprise.” The touchiness of the bank-man
is proverbial ; his brother, the life-insurance
director or manager, is, if possible, still more
touchy. But time teaches even Australians.
Recent events have convinced them —and they
needed to be convinced—that the proud fabric
of banking business is reared on a frail
foundation. That the same conviction has not
come home to them, in regard to companies
doing life business, arises from the circumstance
that the contingencies covered by assurance
are, for the most part, remote, not being likely
to arise for twenty-five or thirty years as an
average. If a hundred men of 30 years of age
insure to-day, not 33 claims will arise in 30
years, so that an office has always “a good
show ” before its delinquencies are found out
by anyone other than an expert. There is also
in favour of the insurance offices, a conspiracy
of silence on the part of the financial press. In
any other country, the methods pursued by
certain blatant offices doing business in these
provinces would have met with unqualified
condemnation. But here the faint murmurs of
disapproval, occasionally expressed in the
specialist papers, are hushed to silence on the
display of a sufficiently large advt.

It flatters our pride to think that, so far, no
office trading in Australia has failed, but, after
all, this is a small mercy to be thankful for, as
the average age of local offices is well under 20
years. All they crave is a little more time.
But if Australia yields no evidence of the
failure of a life company, England, the home of
all financial righteousness, offers a tempting
list to choose from. In 1844 the Joint Stock
Companies Act was passed. As if by magic
there sprang into existence, in the very next
year, a multitude of life-companies, of which 48
were registered provisionally, but only 20 com-
pleted their registration. At the end of 21
years only one of these companies remained
alive ; all the rest had died an unnatural death,
become insolvent, or been absorbed by other
companies. Taking 25 years as little enough
time to prove a life office, the test applied to
English offices is very unsatisfactory. Some
257 offices commenced business from 1845 to
1866, and of these not 20 are now existing—237
and more have gone under. This bare state-
ment of how they do things in England disposes
of the contention that life companies should
not be made the subject of State interference.
If making provision for the widow and the
orphan be the sacred and solemn duty that
popular opinion supposes it to be, then the
State has a solemn call to see that the money in-
tended for their use reaches them, and is not
diverted to the pockets of adventurers.
* • •
The principle of life-assurance is that for a
certain present payment or series of payments
a sum of money will be paid on a certain con-
tingency happening. That contingency is
usually the death of the person insuring. For
the yearly payment of about £1 17s. 7d. any
office will assure to a man now 30 years of age
the sum of .£IOO when he dies. This £1 17s. 73.
is made up of two parts, the actual risk, valued
at about £1 13s. 4d. and called the pure pre-
mium, and 4s. 3d., the loading, a provision for
expenses. Were all insurers 30 years of age it
would be permissible for the company insuring
to spend the 4s, 3d.— i.e., something less than
12 per cent, of the total premiums—in getting
or keeping their risks. Now, how does the
business of life-assurance square with these
facts ? The cost of working this class of busi-
ness in Australia ranges from 13 per cent, of
the premium income to over 31 per cent. —not
including industrial business, which runs up to
80 per cent.—that is to say, the most economi-
cally managed company conducts its business
at a price somewhat over the loading, while
the most expensive absorbs all the loading, and
besides, a lot of the money that should be set
apart to meet the risk when it happens.
» • •
It must not be hurriedly assumed from this
that all the companies are insolvent. While
business is being extended it is allowable for a
company to anticipate some of the loading of
future years to pay for present necessities, but
no sane man will contend that any society can
safely carry on which habitually pays away 30
per "cent, of its premium income to maintain
and extend its business, when the provision
made for such purposes is only 12 per cent.
Yet this is what several companies have been
doing ever since they started. Every decent
company makes its valuations on a pure
premium basis—that is to say, when making up
its assets it assumes that to cash in hand there
is added the present value of future payments
made by policy holders, on the assumption that
all the loading is required to work the business
and only the pure premiums are available for
risks. How then do societies that make
heavy inroads into their future resources come
out triumphantly under valuation ? Easily
enough. They can do as their banking friends
have done —write up their assets. By writing
up its landed property before realisation to the
tune of £24,000, one company was able to show
a surplus of £4200. This was a few years
ago, but how would such valuation stand to-
day ? Another way is to assume more than the
pure premium to be available to meet the risk,
which also is a deception. But why complete
the list? The ways open to an insurance man
bent upon bolstering up his company are
legion. Actuaries may be honest, as they some-
times are, and bring out the right valuation
from their point of view, but the other side of
the office —the business manager and directors
—can always adjust the value of the properties
to suit the exigencies of their position. As
often as not the actuaries are the mere tools of
the office that employs them : they make their
valuation to order. One company, not so long
ago, had a valuation made on a 5 per cent,
basis, which proved to be a very necessary pre-
caution, seeing that by this means the assets
were made to cover the liabilities.
• • «
All companies doing business here, including
foreign companies, reckon the interest obtain-
able during "the currency of their policies will
average 4 per cent., and their valuations are
made on the supposition that the money
received will be continuously invested at this
rate, the assumption being that over 4 per cent,
will be earned during the first half of the
period and less than that rate during the
remainder of the term covered by the policies.
Not much actuarial or other sort of knowledge
is needed to see that what is now earned over
4 per cent, should be set wholly or in part
against the less amount expected to be ob-
tained hereafter. Yet these so-called prudent
and conservative societies are coolly dividing
the present excess, instead of stowing it away
to meet the fall in interest which they them
selves assume to be inevitable. If the actuaries


did not break this elementary law of their
science their wretched companies would not
able to declare a bonus of any kind,
aa more than the margin out of which
bonuses are supposed to be paid is swal-
lowed up in maintaining an army ot touts.
p u t worse than this, there is a doubt even
about the 4 per cent., for no one outside an
assurance office will seriously contend there is
‘ V probability that safe investments will be
Procurable, ten years hence, for large amounts,
at so high a rate. Convinced of this the largest
local company is dropping its valuations
down to 3i per cent., and on a percent
basis how many companies in Australia would
be solvent ? When it is remembered that on
this basis the average premiums only allow for
an expenditure of per cent, for working
expenses, it will take a lot of figuring out to
prove that expenditure at the rate of 30 per
cent, can long be borne. As a matter of cal-
culation, it can be shown that in seven years
the whole provision for expenses will become
exhausted, and unless a constant influx of mem-
bers is maintained bankruptcy will be the
result. How then do societies keep afloat?
Simply by having two classes of members —
those who participate in the profits and those
who do not, the one class being charged a high
premium to admit of profits with economical
management, while the other is charged bare
expenses. As a matter of fact, few belong to
the second category, and societies are able to
carry on simply because what members fondly
suppose to be available for profits, is spent in
working the concern. We have little hope of
making our meaning clear by abstract reason-
ing, we therefore throw in an example from
their own returns which, doubtless, will be
pleasing to the societies selected—viz., three
whose head offices are in Melbourne. The com-
panies have all been in existence 20 years, and
have, therefore, got over the critical period of
babyhood # #
The annual revenue of the three offices from
premiums is ,£585,000, and of this, according to
their own showing, £457,000 is the value of the
risks they run, and £44,000 is required for
ordinary expenses, so that the sum available
for profits distributable as bonuses in every year
should be £84,000. The actual realisation is
somewhat different. As the result of 20 years’
work, these companies have given their mem-
bers bonuses equivalent to about £120,000 cash ;
that is to say, a year and a-halfs savings if
their management had not been extravagant.
All this points to what has long been well
known —competition has reached so acute a
stage as to endanger the very safety of the
competing offices. Amongst the ignorant mem-
bers of the Ancient Order of Cemented Bucks,
who are struggling for supremacy with the
Ultra-Marine Lodge of Holy Romans, such un-
healthy business might be expected. For them
the light of actuarial science shines in vain, but,
then, the friendly society people never pretend
to have any respect for science—their guide is
rule of thumb. With life companies it is
different. Their common cant is about ex-
pectation of life, mean-after-lifetime, gradation
of risks, and such like, and if they go to perdi-
tion it is with their eyes open wide. Assurance
offices one and all deprecate the cut-throat busi-
ness they are engaged in, but the sincerity of
their professions in this regard can be tested by
their actual performances. Passing over the
late disturbed years, and going back to 1892, it
will be found that the proportion of manage-
ment expenses to premium income was over
30 per cent, in two offices, from 25 to 30 per-
cent. in five, and from 20 to 25 in three, one
office standing solitary with less than 14 per
cent. As for the so-called industrial or working
men’s societies, they spend 13 to 16 shillings
out of every pound paid, and therefore should
be doing splendidly—for those who run them.
# * *
The evil is big, and admits of either of two
remedies, State regulation —which offices, one
and all, protest against as a tyrannous inven-
tion of the devil, and which, moreover, they
declare has not been successful in America,
where it is in operation —or State insurance.
In 1870, Julius Vogel introduced State life
assurance into Maoriland, and, after 20 years
of trial, no one disputes its signal success, for
no British office, established during the last 40
years has achieved equal results. The Maori-
' land State department charges lower rates than
any competing company, and, in spite ol this,
has accumulated more funds than any Aus-
tralian office, the A.M.P. Society, of course,
excepted. Maoriland’s example has not yet
been followed by any other province, though a
serious proposal for State insurance now comes
from South Australia. Against this proposal the
companies are up in arms. So far, their chief
argument against the proposal is that the State
must not move because the companies at work
_ have vested interests that should not be dis-
turbed. Quite true, and so (to use an extreme
illustration) Matthias Larkin felt as regards
his post when the shareholders tried to remove
him from his managership. But the broad
principles of public policy which justify the
State undertaking the business of life-assurance
are not likely to be affected by the cry of
vested interests. Above all things else it is the
duty of the State to look to the welfare of the
weaker members of the community. Hitherto,
its accepted duty has been to feed the fat and
support the strong. Public sentiment applauds
the man who makes provision for the well-being
of those who are bound to him by ties of rela-
tionship, and the same applause cannot be
denied to the State when it does the same for
those bound to it by ties of citizenship.
• • •
The insurance-companies cry out that the
provision is already secure through them. From
the references already made to insurance fin-
ance, it is evident that the security is at best
doubtful. The break-down of the insurance
companies would be a ten thousand times more
awful calamity than that of the banks, and who
can say that it will not happen ? The State alone
can give insurance which really insures. Even
the best of the companies is liable to be upset
by bad investments. Not so the State, since it
has all the security a private company can offer
with the public guarantee super-added. The
security is everything. What certainty is
there in regard to private offices ? Absolutely
none, and that the majority of them think so
may be gathered from the fact that, with one
or two bright exceptions, their published
balance-sheets and statements of business are
models of reticence. They are so judiciously
vague as to engender the thought that where
so much is concealed, there is a reason
for concealment more satisfactory to the
officials of the companies than reassur-
ing to their clients. The State has every
reason to be distrustful, and where so much is
at stake it does well to take care no risks are
run. To certainty of insurance the State is in
a position to join cheapness. Its officers are in
every part of the country, their agency will cost
little, and the quarter of a million yearly ex-
pended on insurance bagmen will be saved to
the policy-holder, as well as the larger part of
a like amount laid out on office management.
State life assurance is, however, only one step
in the right direction. There is no reason in
the world why the State should not undertake
the duty now grievously bungled by the friendly
societies, and provide relief in sickness and
annuities in old age to all who choose to avail
themselves of its good offices.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An Inconvertible Paper Currency.
The weary debate on the Victorian Credit
Fonder Bill was interrupted lately by a sug-
gestion for getting the province, to some extent
at least, out of the old rut of finance. Under
the Bill it is proposed to borrow £5,000,000 at
4 per cent, and lend it out at 5 per cent, on
laud-mortgages with a 50 per cent, margin. A
revolutionary M.L.A. interrupted the solemnity
of the proceedings just here by suggesting that,
instead of borrowing the £5,000,000 and lend-
ing it at 5 per cent., the State should issue
£5,000,000 in legal tender notes, and lend them
out on mortgage at 4 per cent. This would
bring in £200,000 a year in interest, and each
year the interest would be used to redeem
£200,000 worth of notes until the whole issue
was extinguished. When it was entirely ex-
tinguished the State would have £5,000,000
invested on land-mortgages and an annual
income of £200,000, which had cost it abso-
lutely nothing, and it was suggested that this
income should be “ ear-marked,” according to
the good old Gillies phrase, as a sinking-fund
for the reduction of the public debt. If the
demand for loans increased, the Govern-
ment notes, as they returned to the Land
Bank in the shape of interest, might be rein-
vested in new mortgages, but the total amount
to be circulated at any time should never exceed
£5,000,000. This was the astounding pro-
posal which flabbergasted the stereotyped
borrowers of the Assembly, and after a few
minutes of horrified consideration it was
thrown out almost unanimously. The Vic.
Legislature has no inclination for “ wild
experiments” or “ reckless legislation” in any
shape ; it is a gathering of eminently serious
spirit-dealers, lawyers and land-boomers, and
anything revolutionary inspires it with horror.
Yet the proposition deserved a lot of hard con-
sideration, which it certainly didn’t get. The
question to be decided is—could Victoria carry,
for a limited period, £5,000,000 of inconvertible
paper money, without depreciation ? In all
probability it could. Similar experiments have
succeeded elsewhere, and their success depends
solely on honest management. The circulation
of such an amount in State-guaranteed notes
would mean the extinction of the note issues of
private banks, but that is a matter of exceed-
ingly small importance, and would do more
good than harm. If the experiment were
carried out honestly, and succeeded, it would
mean an immense gain to the community ; and
if it failed it couldn’t, by any human possibility,
fail so badly as the good, old borrowing policy
has done and is still doing. The constantly-
reiterated objection to an inconvertible paper
currency, even as a small and temporary ex-
pedient, is that there is always a tendency to go
on expanding it until a ruinous depreciation sets
in. But the Same is equally true of any other
device for borrowing, either openly or in disr
guise. Victoria has raised loans in the English
market until she is wrecked and nearly insol-
vent; and when the choice lies between more
pubhc borrowing and the issue of a limited and
temporarily .inconvertible State currency for
the of the Land Bank only, the
odds lobk very much in favour of the latter
device. Anyhow, Victoria is just now a
favourable field in which to try an experiment
of the kind, for all the ancient methods of finance
are played out. And the one thing that is
certain about the new idea is that, even at its
worst, it couldn’t be worse than the old ones.
How Things Happen.
“ The king is dead ; long live the king !” The
Griffilwraith is also dead ; but Boodlewraith
has succeeded it. Boodlewraith, to be sure,
has no flesh and blood individuality whatever,
being merely The Bulletin’s pet name for an
imaginary little cherub who sits up aloft to
guide the destinies of Queensland. But its
euphonic merit, and its ability to dispense with
the definite article, are no misleading signs of
superiority. The vigour of the Griffilwraith
was slightly impaired by an extraordinary
disease which one of the principals called his
“ principles.” Now, foxes have holes, but the
“principles” of the Griffilwraith, well mixed
with baser matter, found nowhere to lay their
heads and sub-heads among the cloven feet
which that strange pair of bedfellows protruded.
So they expired in a ruinous Samsonian spasm,
which pulled down a fee of £2778 3s. hd. and a
salary of £3500 per annum for the fortunate
proprietor —together with an eloquent eulogy
from a junior patriot (fee, £2968 135.), who
vainly ransacked history for heroes pure enough
to hang their hats upon the golden knobs of his
client’s characteristic character. The trap closed
finally on the Griffilwraith, and, with a
sulphurous smell of overdrafts, Boodlewraith
sprang up. Then things began to hum. Pre-
viously things had happened. So early as
1878, when the Union Bank of Australia held
the Queensland Government’s account, and the
funds at fixed deposit were pretty equally
divided among the banks doing business in
the province, it occurred to E. R. Drury,
manager of the Queensland National Bank,
that it would be advantageous to the public if
further droppings fell upon him. He pressed
this view upon J. R. Dickson, Treasurer of
the Douglas Ministry, in an interesting corres-
pondence, with the result that Mr. Dickson
felt himself profoundly grieved to be unable to
see eye to eye with Mr. Drury. If money did
not have such a short memory, it would seem
not improbable that Drury kept all Dickson’s
sayings in his heart; for, at the general elec-
tion of 1879, the whole of the Q.N. Bank in-
fluence was cast against the Douglas Ministry,
and Mr. Thomas MTlwraith became Premier
of the new Government on January 21. On
April 26 the Government agreed to transfer its
account to the Q.N. Bank, but the Union in-
sisted on six months’ notice. So things couldn’t
happen much till September. On Sept. 10,
1879, the Q.N. Bank held £270,000 of Govern-
ment money. On Sept. 11 it held £1,303,134.
That was the beginning of the Q.N. Bank
Government moneyopoly. Since that date
Queensland has borrowed, in round numbers,
£25,000,000, nearly the whole of which has
passed through the Q.N. Bank and paid toll in
the shape of half-yearly dividends. It is only
the first step which costs, and once things
commenced to happen they kept on. MTl-
wraith left office in 1883, but by that
time the Bank was firmly entrenched. MTl-
wraith came back to office in 1888 and floated
a million loan. Then the little sum stood :
June 30, 1889— Govt, funds in Q.N. Bank £2,308,418
„ ~ ~ ~ Other Banks 1,000.000
In 1889, MTlwraith left the Morehead
Ministry, but returned to power as Griffilwraith
Treasurer on August 12, 1890. Then things
no longer happened ; they hurried. See :
June 30, 1891—Govt, funds in Q.N. Bank £1,286,459
~ „ ~ ~ Other Banks 450,000
June 30, 1892 ~ ~ Q.N. Bank 1,903,793
„ ~ ~ ~ Other Banks 265,000
But March 27, 1893, saw the dissolution of the
Griffilwraith, and then things fairly hummed.
Look :
June 30, 1893—Govt, funds in Q.N. Bank £2,425,203
~ ~ ~ ~ 6 other Banks 486,000
Then the 8.N.5.W., the Australasia, and the
Union dropped out of the running, so that we
have;—
June 30, 1893—Govt, funds in Q.N. Bank £3,000,000
~ ~ ~ ~ 3 other banks 181,000
Just here it seems appropriate to remark that
(1) No one has any idea what the Q.N. Bank
owes—if it owes anything—to the MTlwraith
party. (2) No one has any idea what the MTl-
wraith party owes — if it owes anything — to
the Q.N. Bank. These are axioms. Axioms
are self-evident propositions. Propositions sup-
port theories. Sometimes theories don’t alto-
gether explain how things happen. Sometimes
they do.
“The Natural Rate of Interest.”
The Maoriland Government proposes to start a
Credit Fonder of its own, and, with this object
in view, it intends to borrow £1,500,000 at 3J
per cent. —whether in London or within its own
province is not yet known with certainty, and
lend it out at 5 per cent, on mortgages of agri-
cultural lands, in order to relieve the farmer
from the usury with which he is now burdened.
The borrowing at 3| per cent, is a lamentable
device for a province which has abjured kite-
flying for several years, and was believed to
have abandoned it for ever, and if the Seddon
Cabinet had only a little more courage it might
have provided the required capital by an issue
of State notes, its credit being fully good
enough for such an experiment. As to the
lending part of the scheme, it will, if honestly
and capably conducted, be an unmingled bless-
ing to a community which has hitherto been
exploited by financial marauders of the ten per
sheut persuasion. Up to date, the loudest voice
which has been raised in execration of the
scheme has been that of the Sydney Telegraph,
which evidently fears that the Credit Fonder
idea may spread to New South Wales, and
holds forth on sound Foreign-trade principles as
follows :
The cry is that unless the State comes to the farmfrs’
assistance with cheap mortgages and cheap railway
freights the whole of the lout:-coddled agricultural in-
dustry stands in danger of perishing. It is impossible to
view any of these schemes without feelings of the very
gravest apprehension. For the State to attempt to arti-
ficially cheapen money is just the same as to attempt
artificially raising the price of products. In each case the
whole difference between the natural and the artificial
rate must come out of the pockets of the taxpayers. If
the fanners get cheap money from a State Bank or big
prices in a State-protected market, it can only be at the
expense of the rest of the community.
The fact that the Credit Fonder scheme has
been an unalloyed success for many years in
many countries evidently counts for nothing.
The State Bank is coming near, and the Tele-
graph, which admired a State Bank as long as
there seemed to be no danger of getting one,
grows alarmed. As for fits reasoning, that is
drivel of the most abject order. The State
doesn’t propose to artificially cheapen money —
it simply proposes to cheapen money ; there is
nothing artificial about cheap money, and no-
thing especially natural about dear money. The
assertion that “the whole difference between
the natural and the artificial rate must come
out of the pockets of the taxpayers,” has a
sonorous sound something like that of a gong in
the distance, but it means nothing. The money
which is now lent to the farmer at 8 or 10 per
cent, is mostly British capital; the money which
will be lent by the State at 5 per cent, will also,
unfortunately, be mostly British capital; there-
fore, the difference will come out of the pockets
of the money-lender, and his alone. Provided
the Credit Fonder is a success the only loser
will be the money-lender. Moreover there is
no “ natural ” or “ artificial ” rate of interest ;
the rate of interest, both natural and artificial,
is simply as much as the lender can get, and
whether he gets per cent, or 240 makes no
difference. When the British Government sells
Consols at 2| per cent, per annum, and when
some gaudy ass borrows from Cohen at 20 per
cent, per month, the processes are equally
natural. Also, when a reduction is made in
either case it is equally “at the expense of the
community ” —always presuming that Cohen is
the community, which he isn’t. The Tele-
graph, however, evidently takes it for granted
that he is.
A Person of no Account*
Last Thursday, at Sydney, one John Camp*
bell was arraigned for the murder of his wife.
The prisoner was a man without means (or
perhaps, having means, he was not sane enough
to call for and instruct a lawyer), of no
social standing, and with no rich or influential
friends, and the proceedings took the form
which is usual under such circumstances. The
prosecution was represented by Mr. Barton,
ex-Attorney-General, ex-Speaker of the Legis-
lative Assembly, a Queen’s Counsel, and one of
the very ablest men at the New South Wales
bar. His case was carefully prepared for him
by the Crown Law offices and the police and
detectives, who had got together all the facts
which could possibly assist the prisoner towards
the gallows, and had collected an array of
evidence to support the case for the “ Crown.”
And against all this there was absolutely
nothing ; every arrangement had been made to
hear one side of the case, and no arrangement
whatever to hear the other. Under these lop-
sided conditions the Judge adjourned for one
whole hour —60 minutes—and at the end of that
time a very junior barrister almost an
infant barrister, indeed turned up to
conduct the defence. He had no solicitor
to prepare his case, or to hunt up witnesses ;
he had no time or money or opportunity to
master the facts of the case, or to consider the
evidence for the prosecution, or to get a coherent
statement for his client, or to procure any
medical opinions as to his state of mind, or to
discover the antecedents of the deceased, or to do
anything. In fact, he had no case at all, and even
if he had possessed such a thing he was pitted
against one of the best and most experienced
intellects at the local bar. Therefore, he
had practically to let matters slide and con-
tent himself with what was really only an
appeal for mercy on no visible grounds, and his
client was duly sentenced to be hanged, which
he, at least technically, deserved to be in any
case. But if he had been an innocent man
wrongly accused he would almost assuredly
have been sentenced just the same under the
circumstances. The system which pits a junior
barrister with barely an hour to prepare his
case, against the Treasury, one of the leaders of
the bar, the Crown Solicitor with his trained
staff of assistants, the detective and police force
and a host of expert witnesses, is murder,
pure and simple. A law-case is as intricate
a piece of mechanism as a watch, and when a
prisoner, who, being in gaol, has had no oppor-
tunity to prepare his own cause, and has had
no one to do it for him, is brought out and
ordered to produce a fully-elaborated defence
on the spot or be hanged for want of it, his
position is much the same as if he were pre-
sented with a mass of pig-iron, and ordered to
make a chronometer on the instant as the price
of his life. The whole system is radically
wrong. It is not the business of the law to act
as purveyor to the gallows. Its mission is not
to obtain convictions promiscuously but to find
out the truth, and it gains as much by the
acquittal of the man who is wrongly accused as
by the conviction of the one who is accused
rightly. Therefore it should furnish as perfect
and as elaborate machinery for the defence as it
does for the prosecution, and until it does this
it is only a lopsided device which gives justice
to the man who has money and “lags” the
man who has none, simply because he Has none.
Pear Bulletin, —The statement that the New
South Wales labour vote in 1894 was only half
what it was in 1891 is misleading. Everything
depends upon classification of candidates ; and
as there are no exact data upon which to class
them, there cannot possibly be an exact con-
clusion. Both Herald and Telegraph endea-
vour to swell the Freetrade vote at the expense
of labour, but even accepting the worst classifi-
cation, that of the Telegraph, which counts
Cook and other unpledged Labour representa-
tives as Freetraders, it will be seen that the
Protectionist vote in 1891 was reduced by 48
per cent., the Labour vote by 52 per cent., and
the Freetrade vote by no less than 58 per cent.
Here are the Telegraph’s own figures. In
1891 : Freetrade, 177,769; Protection, 133,565 ;
Labour, 103,787 ; Independent, 10,997. This
last group consisted of Haynes, Jones, REiD t
Want, and J. P. Abbott, all of whom, wit
the exception of Abbott, who was returned uuh
opposed, were Freetraders. Add them on and-
we have:—
Freetrade. Protection. Labour.
1891 188,766 133,565 103,787
1894 78,994 68,470 48,980
Reduction 109,772 65,095 54,807
Personally I put little reliance on the figures
for 1891, nor can I agree with either of the
quoted aggregates for Labour, which are
obtained by a manifestly unfair classification
of members. But, accepting the Telegraph
figures, no comment is more eloquent than the
mere statement of the respective reductions of
the three parties ; Labour, 54,807 ! Protection,
65,095 ! ! Freetrade, 109,772 ! ! !—Yours, &c.,

John M ‘Neill, a red-hot Gospeller, with a
Sankey in tow, seems to have “squared” the
Melbourne editors by some means or other, and
converted reporters are allowed to pour out
two-column notices of his travelling show.
Result—another nauseating burst of pious
hysteria, and a lot of money for M'Neill to
spend as he chooses. Probably he is an honest
egotist, who devotes the surplus cash to what
he considers “God’s work.” It were better
for mankind if he clung to all the profits and
retired from business as soon as possible. Mel-
bourne especially is already suffering enough
from the machinations of people who “ love
Jesus ” and have “ found Christ,” therefore a
full chested evangelist avowedly bent upon
spreading faith of this kind, and nothing more
moral, might as well be a disseminator of
sm all-pox germs. Better, indeed—for the
physical disease can be put into quaran-
tine, whereas these nonconformist epidemics
are allowed to run loose. It is useless to argue
against the cheap, nasty, and fundamentally
immoral religion of the Wesleys, Moodys,
Booths, and M ‘Neills, with its blatant refer-
ences to “the Blood of the Lamb” and its
puerile Bible-idolatry. Ignorant, well-disposed
creatures and born humbugs will always be

subject to blessed “sudden conversions” which
the Melbourne chapel-stormer attributes to the
grace of God. Everybody wants a faith, in-
cluding the aggressive Atheist who makes
rather more fuss over his than does the aggres-
sive pietist. Meanwhile, intelligent Christians
are also being suddenly converted to a religion
that weeps for M‘Neill and abhors the howl-
ing impudence of revivalist hymns. Thinkers
find the truth concerning M‘Neillism in an
instant, even as the dupes of that mis-
guided collection-taker “find Christ.” Educa-
tion will increase the number of enlightened
thinkers until only idiots and Jabez Balfours
are left to swear by M'Neillism. Finally,
Jabez will cease snuffling because it has lost its
virtue, and the name of Wesley will be cursed,
once and for all, by Act of Parliament. That
awful saint, whose unconverted wife used to
sit in the front row and put her tongue out at
him, may not have been the founder, though he
certainly seems to be the patron saint, of the
new school of commercial fraud.

The Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney shows
a net profit for the half-year of £25,600, and pays a div.
at the rate of 8 per cent, per annum, which absorbs
£33,900, so the co. ends £BOOO worse off than it
began. For a vast concern like the Commercial, with
£886,000 of paid-up capital, and £1,010,000 of reserve
fund, and over £3,000,000 of cash on hand, this is a matter
of little importance, but to some of the recon-
structed institutions it would be a serious affair. The
apparent falling off in the profits is chiefly owing to the
large sums which have been set aside to meet possible
depreciation. Meanwhile, the Commercial Banking Co.
occupies a curious position. It lately offered, informally,
to release a large proportion of its reconstructed deposits,
but as these are now selling at par. in the open market,
and as there is no present prospect of getting the
same interest elsewhere with as good security,
the owners almost unanimously declined the offer. The
reconstructed depositors in Mr. T. A. Dibbs’ bank refuse
to take their money and leave unless they are violently
“chucked out.” As the bank has no present use for a
great part of the money it is now considering the advis-
ability of chucking them out accordingly. The situation
is weird and anomalous ; no other bank in Australasia has
ever succeeded in getting into such a position, though a
very large number would like to do so. If the Commercial
Banking Co.’s deposits could be guaranteed against re-
payment until the end of their term they would probably
fetch 21s. in the £ on Sydney Exchange.

The .£2,000,000 of State-guaranteed 4 per cent,
stock issued by the Bank of New Zealand was tendered
for five time* over. It now probably dawns on the stupid
individual who planned the scheme that the cash could
have been obtained about as easily at 3£, and probably, if
the stock had been sold openly at a fixed price instead of
being disposed of by tender, it might have realised almost
a* good a figure. The Maoriland Government can borrow
money with ease on its own aecurity at 3J per cent., and
in the present case there is the security of the Govern-
ment and that of the 8.N.Z., whatever the latter may be
worth, thrown in.
• * • ♦
Mr. Wynne, Solicitor-General in the Patterson
Government, has a measure before the House which pro-
vides, among other things, that trading companies may
work under the no-liability principle. The effect of this will
simply be to abolish that delusive asset, “ uncalled
capital.” On the no-liability principle calls are legally
irrecoverable; the shareholder who won’t pay simply
forfeits his shares. Under such a law no insolvent trading
00. or bank could collect apenny in calls, for no one would
pay in such circumstances, and a good many of the banks
which are still alive would be in much the same situation,
for nobody voluntarily pays a ss. call on shares which
can’t be »old for half-a-crown.
The change is a move in the right direction,
anyhow. “Uncalled capital,” as a rule, only serves to
delude the public with a bogus aspect of solidity, and it is
only realisable when it isn’t wanted. An enormous pro-
portion of the deposits gathered in by the Mercantile
“ tentacle*” were secured because the uncalled capital in
each case was so massive that it seemed to promise abso-
lute security, no matter what happened. And when the
trouble came, the security in every case proved to be
mainly Matthew Davies, and Matthew, in the face of this
stupendous mass of liabilities, wasn’t worth anything.
Most other people, under like conditions, are worth just
about as much. “ Uncalled capital ” is as beautiful as a
rainbow and about as good a security to advance money
on. Anybody who has ever had a lien upon a rainbow
will understand this.
« « • «
This is a woefully bad time for the man who
has borrowed money on excellent security from a recon-
structed bank. Also.it is a conespondingly good time
for the man who has borrowed huge sums on very bad
security, or on no security at all. The bank has to make
a show of accumulating a large cash balance because
there is a mania for disproportionate cash balances, now
that the depositors have all been “ fixed ” and there is no
immediate demand tor cash. And, in addition to this,
it is necessary to inform the shareholders at each
half-yearly meeting that the liquidation of the “old
bank ” is progressing satisfactorily, and that a
large sum has been realised, and that the assets
are turning out well. And the only way to do
this is to sell up only those customers whose
advances are sure to turn out well. If they sold up
instead the old, hopeless boomers who pay neither inter-
est nor principal, and will never pay either, the re-
port would probably state that £1,000,000 worth of
ifsets had been realised, and had produced about
£50,000. Then there would be a howl of fury and a panic.
So certain of the banks keep selling up and bankrupting
the honest men, who pay interest on their overdrafts
regularly, and whose securities are worth three times the
amount advanced on them ; and very often they lend the
money thus realised to the utterly hopeless boomers, lest
they should go insolvent, and the amount of their over-
drafts should he revealed on their schedules, and horrid
revelations should ensue. It is a strange world.

The A. J.S. Bank has, during the last year, paid
off £972,320 of its indi-btedness to reconstructed deposi-
tors, and has advanced over £1,000,000 on the security of
deposit-receipts. It has £241,000 invested in Govt, bonds,
*nd it has a million and a quarter in available cash, which
Is actually more than all its liabilities on current accounts,
bills, notes and balances due to other banks. This
illustrates the state of excessive caution which the big re-
constructed banks have got into. The A.J.S. could safely
invest £500,000 more in Government debentures and thus
make over £16,000 per annum in interest for its share-
holders, or it could pay off £500,000 of its old fixed
deposits ; but last year’s disaster has created a mania for
stupendous cash-balances, at least halt of which are only
wanted for the board to gloat over.

enquiry closed in a haze of mystery as to a certain
judge’s real connection with the business. There is
always a mysterious termination to any scandal that

In Melb. there are yet many hundreds under

go the last rag, and with a forlorn hope that gas is to

isn’t due, under the terms rf the arrangement, till 1896,
but before that time the B.N.Q. hopes, with reasonable
good fortune, to liberate all its reconstructed funds. Also,
it has decided to take no more British deposits for less
than five years—the short-dated British investor having
been the cause of its previous troubles. Wanted to know
—does the Q.N.B. feel like following suit in this liberal

Melbourne Tramway Go. did the moat astonish-
ing act of its career last Saturday, when it declared a 5
percent, div. The actual profits for the year are only
£19,723, and the div. absorbs £24,000, but the deficiency
is made up out of the last year’s balance. Even the fact
that 4 per cent, has actually been earned is something
calculated to make the shareholder fall down dead with
surprise. The result has been arrived at mainly through
hard economy, and bv consistently grinding the hones of
the miserable ; and there are grave hope* that
by a little further grinding the present div. may be
maintained.

No silver-lead mine in the world approaches in

Proprietary half-year’s work represents 257,278
tons of ore treated, producing 7,287,3370 z. silver, 25,638
tons lead, and 441 tons copper—weekly average 280,2820 z.
silver, 986 tons lead, and 17 tons copper. At the refinery
at Port Pirie 10,117 tons of silver-lead bullion were
treated, result being 9108 tong lead, 3,037,8380 z. fine
silver, 13410 z. gold, 165 tons antimonial metal, and 330
tons copper matte, representing 158 tons copper and
45,1750 z. silver. About two-fifths of the bullion was thus
refined ; the rest exported. Ultimately the co. will refine
all its products and treat the copper matte which is now
sold abroad at a disadvantage.
Proprietary open cuts, the most daring and
original mining work in progress in Australia, now
extend practically the whole length of the mine ; depth,
from 30ft. to 100 ft. During past half-year they produced
78,159 tons ore, and 196,113 superficial feet of mine timber
were recovered. They have rendered yields erratic, but
mining economical, the manager says.

under the wing of the famous English contralto. A
benefit is to occur, which, with Ethel’s own numerous
friends and admirers, and her father’s big circle of
sporting brethren, will be a great success.
It may be just as well to say, in re certain report*
which appear to have been current regarding a lady
singer who lately left Sydney, that her intention to go
was publicly announced some months ago ; that she went
away by herself and with the full approval of her hus-
band, who actually signed the contract with the entre-
preneur with whom she engaged.
Whilst the “Village Priest” was being performed in
Melbourne the faithful were exhorted from the Catholic
pulpits to abstain from attending at that particular
theatre.
Jokes from Gov. Robinson’s comic opera :
“Guida seems to have led us the wrong way. Miss
Guida is a misguider.”
Biigand ;“ I will sing you a ditty—or banditti.”
And such a chestnut as: “We are lost.”
Brigand : “On the contrary, madam, you are found.”
Hats off to librettist Hart.
When the Holloway co. was in Bendigo some yean
ago a local newspaper’s account was sent to Mrs. Hollo-
way (Essie Jenyns’ mother)—she always was cashier-
made out as for “ Professor Holloway." The lady’s ire at
the blunder was awful. As she put it:—“The idea of
being confounded with a quack vendor of pills 1” The
newspaper manager mildly murmured something about
Holloway’s immense fortune, but Mrs. Plain Bill only
sighed.
Tenor Leumane, who had a financial crash in Adelaide
over his English opera season, is at present very ill.
However, he finds time to write the press pro-
mising full payment of his debts. Leumane has an
honourable record and should be given a good benefit,
especially as others would also be assisted thereby.
Talmage is very emotional in preaching. At Exetei
Hall, on one occasion, he was so moved to tears, that
when he leaned over the pulpit, the reporters had to put
up an umbrella to prevent their notes being obliterated.
Minnie Palmer and John Rogers have squared their
divorce-suit. Advt. ?
Gov. Glasgow, of Maoriland, attended six out of eight
Sapio-Urso concert* in Wellington Opera House. On the
last night, his Ex. sent along a cheque in full payment of
space occupied.
The quarrel between the late Trebellini-Bettini and her
daughter, concerning which there have been cables to
Australia, began in a very Frenchy way. Trebelli and
her daughter went to Sweden in company with that
fascinating French fiddler, Musin. Before many days,
Musin declared his love for the daughter, then 16, who,
though reciprocating, said she must ask her mamma, as
all French girls do, they say. She accordingly told
mamma, who was horrified, and said, “It cannot be, he
already loves me 1 I will give you proofs of it.” An
appointment was made by her with Lothario, and the
daughter was placed outside a door whilst he made violent
love to mamma in the room. This was too much for the
girl, who from that day bade good-bye to her mother and
never spoke to her again.
At his last show to-night, Talmage will talk about God,
men and monkey*.
“ The Firm ” has resolved to produce Massenet’*
“ La Navarraise ” in Australia as quickly as possible.
This brief tragic opera at once sprang into a mighty suc-
cess when brought out, for the first time on any stage, in
London, a few weeks ago. It is obviously suggested by
“Cavalleria Rusticana” and “Pagliacci,” and is expected
to go round the continent in the same wildfire manner.
There are good parts for Miss Stewart and Brownlow.
G. Majeroni may date his career from “ Geo. Barnwell.”
He was the only man in the Co. who could look it.
Billoloway might tackle Romeo, butCbas. was too modest
for Barnwell.
Aug. W. Juncker’s pretty song, “ I was Dreaming,”
which Nellie Stewart has made such a big success, has, it
is stated, already run through a first edition of 8000
copies. The publisher, Mr. H. J. Samuell, has a second
edition ready.
Decima Moore, who, rumour says, comes here shortly,
is a singularly -piquant actress with a sweet and flexible
voice. She is one of four clever daughters of a Brighton
(Eng.) chemist.
“ Tay Pay ” says the accusation against Melba that she
can’t act no longer holds good. “In the mad-scene of
‘Lucia’ she introduced herself as a new creature, a
living, suffering woman, not a mere operatic figure with
some well-placed top notes.”
Probable that Lawrence Cautley will Join Maltby’s
Australian comedy co.
From a letter written by a clergyman to Albert
Chevalier about his artistic rendering of “My Old
Dutch,” the following is worth quoting: “ I may tell,
perhaps, without too much egotism, that I ventured to
quote you, a few Sundays ago, as one of those with a
special ‘ grace of God,’ to awaken in hearts we parsons
cannot reach, appreciation of a faithful woman’s com-
radeship in the hard battle of life."
There is an Australian actor, who was no good in his
prime of health, but since he has been afflicted with a
good deal of pain, he has developed a rich vein of comedy,
which keeps him in engagements.
Bernhardt has few of her Australian co. yet retained.
One only notices Mesdames Gilbert, Seylor, M. M, Piron,
Deschamps, Angelo. The leading man is M. Guitry.
“ Tame critics, who eat out of the manager’s hand.”—
Zangwill.
A young Australian lady, who has just made a brilliant
musical name in England, had a prodigiously narrow
escape on the voyage. Her mother angled to capture, for
her, a desirable party on board, but the girl’s success
reduces such a party to ineligibility. Thus an angel
watches aloft o’er poor Jill, as well as poor Jack.
The cyoloratna business is likely to have a big revival*
shortly, an apparatus having been patented which will
permit a weekly change of picture if desired.


From remarks made at Lambton by Mr.
Hughes, M.L.A., it would appear that when
Sydney Daily Post does come out, it will be as a
“ Democratic morning paper.” The machinery is
now being erected in a Pitt-st. building, two or
three doors from the site of the old Evening News
Office. There will be room for the Post —if the
editor is strong enough to slay every would-be
M.P. and debating-club amateur who wants to
write leading articles.
H. J. Samuell’s publications are now a
household word throughout Australia. His last
publication—Aug. W. Juncker’s lovely song,
“ I was Dreaming”—is now in its second edition,
three thousand copies having been sold. Miss
Nellie Stewart sang it for six weeks in Melbourne
in “ Ma Mie Rosette,” where it was encored every
evening. Mr. Samuell has in the press a charming
“ Slumber Song,” by Harrison White, which Miss
Colbourne Baber will introduce to the Sydney
public. “ The Duchess of York Waltz” is still
the favourite with dancers, being recommended
by Ernest Needs, the leading teacher of dancing
in Sydney. You can always get SarnueU’s
publications from W. H. Paling and Co., Ltd.,
of Sydney and Brisbane; or Allan and Co., and
W. H. Glen and Co., of Melbourne. If your local
musicsellers do not stock them, send a postal

Mt Dear Moorabinda—
Canine history merely repeated itself at the dog-
show at Sydney Exhibition last week, and I dis-
covered no new designs in puppies, and (as usual)
no attempt at artistic staging for the multitude of
bow-wows who got through on their personal
merits only. And yet, although the spectacular
aspect of the annual parade of doggies would be
infinitely improved if Toby were set in a frame of
art muslin instead of straw and chewed-up dog-
biscuit, I still must confess that the squalid sur-
roundings pleased me. I positively exulted in the
presence of an impish toy terrier roosting on a
folded-up undervest and a foggy Skye squatting
on a soiled and torn calico pillow. For these
doggies were obviously ladies’ pets, and it is good
to know that the Australian woman is not the bond-
slave of her pug, but will cheerfully chain up the
pampered beast in an empty gin-case without even
referring to the possibility of rusty nails. Though
the dogs corralled most of the attention, there was
a good flutter of feathers, from tom-tits to turkeys,
and it will ever be a matter of surprise to me why
no fat lady has yet come forth with a stuffed
Langshan cockerel in her bonnet, since his plumage
would make a bird of Paradise look sallow.
Lady Duff, in a dress the colour of cinnamon-
stick, trimmed with velvet and tuck-pointed with
gold cord, fur boa and muff, and the inevitable
toque hat en suite, opened the show, per Major
Leigh, whose yapping way of announcing the fact
fitted the occasion admirably. But although down
for a speaking-part, the only audible sound that
came from her Ladyship was when she gazed into
the vice-president’s face and said “Wot!” Potts
Point will please accept this intimation._ It is
evidently not Guv’mentousey to “ beg parding.”
The prettiest woman who went to the dogs
when I was there was a young English matron in
a black gown and a waist_ you could belt with a
garter, whose sister is a reigning London beauty,
I am told ; and the best form was displayed by a
Maoriland visitress in brown serge and furs and
an effective daffodil in her buttonhole, who talked
with a thick English accent, after the manner of
Maorilandresses, whose peculiarity is that they
can emerge from a place with a name like Whare-
ongaonga and talk fluent Picoadillyisms without
turning a hair. Mrs. “Uncle” Sutton turned
up with three hearse-plumes in her hat; but I was
really more interested in watching society’s heels
than its headpiece, since it was the fashion to hold
your skirts above high-buttoned-up-boots-raark as
you strolled about. It was a style that suited
some people, but I will never forget a stout society
lady in black, who hoisted her draperies to muddy-
road heights and presented the awful spectacle of
a fat woman careering down tLie hill of Time on a
pair of legs far too pipe-stemmy for their burden.
If I had a voice in dog-show arrangements, I
would certainly issue a ukase against visitors
touching the exhibits. _ Everybody pats Toby
when he wags his tail in a friendly way, and it
occurred to me as I saw a suspicious character
making flattering overtures to a fierce but im-
pressionable watch-dog, that, in a burgling age
like the present, the man who plants his house-
dog in a public show for Bill Sikes to make friends
with, isn’t acting in the best interests of his spoons
and forks.
I didn’t expect to unearth a V-shaped audience
at Dr. Talmage’s (I have heard him pronounced
Talmige, Talmahge and Talmidge, but he calls
himself Talmayge, if you please) first utterances
in Australia, at Sydney Centenary Hall on 26th
ult., so I wasn’t disappointed at the oloak-and-
bonnet show. The only ray of full-dress was
supplied by the ’Varsity Pooh-Bah and his fidus
Achates, who bared their linen to the breeze, and
gave the front row the air of waiting for the ballet
to come on. There was a top-heavy house, and
when the lion was let out by the Moderator (a
child of light, whose proud and ceaseless boast it
is that he was once kissed by Queen Victoria—at
a harmless age, however), the cheers wouldn’t have
disgraced a Melbourne Cup winner.
The much-advertised doctor’s debut was a suc-
cess, though his style of talking reminded me of a
person chipping shingles; and I didn’t find my
manners improved by his deportment, either, for
he points with his thumb over his shoulder and
moistens his finger on his lips in a way that would
suggest Bernhardt lip-salve in a less pious lecturer.
It was the largest smile I have ever seen outside a
minstrel show; for nature has endowed Dr. T.
with a mouth that looks lonely without a straight
bar in it; but there is no mistaking its geniality.
The only fault I found with the Talmage smile
(which will now find its way into every pulpit in
the country, I expect) was its irrelevancy. For
instance, it broke forth when Dr. T. was alluding
to woe and sudden death, with the incongruous
effect of a man winking violently at a corpse.
Dr. Talmage has a profile that reminds you of
every Pope’s head you have ever seen flattened
out on a Roman penny, and he wears his hair d la
French hen at the back, while a long wet look is
slicked over the top making a little island of his
occipital baldness. He doesn’t wear a choker, but
a turned-down collar and black bow, and it is only
when he rolls his eyes up to the gas-fittings that
you remember the kurruk.
I wonder why the management sooled the Pres-
byterian Moderator on to the platform to intro-
duce Talmage ? Fancy banding an audience over
to the uncertain mercies of a man who said that
“he could assure Dr. Talmage of his welcome ’’ in
the most top-lofty manner, and finished up with
the hope that they would be able “to see how he
does it ” —as if the magnetic doctor were ft sort of
clerical thimble-rigger who “ did it” with an im-
perceptible turn of the wrist, gentlemen I All
talky introducers are a mistake, and I lirmly
believe they have queered more promising shows
at the outset than they ever set on their legs. But
if you must have your star led on by the nose, as
it were, there ought to be a short, fixed formula
for the sponsor to gabble through with a death-
penalty attached to any original observations.
I am told that Dr. Talmage struck Sydney at a
very hungry time among the unco guid, and that
flocks of meenisters hung about his arrival like
crows round a poultry-yard, hoping to yard up the
good man for their own particular tabernacle.
Indeed, one of them said gleefully to the Much-
Travelled that Talmage had arrived in the nick
of time to boom a drooping kirk, and looked
wildly astonished when it was gently hinted to
him that it was not Dr. T.’s intention to go from
pulpit to pulpit preaching while Brother Hamish
M’Dougall pocketed the “ gate.”
“The Electric Club of N.S.W.” budded out
into a conversazione at Need’s Rooms, the other
Friday. I really must say I have never seen so
bored a lot of people as the women who wandered
among the groves thereof. I thought the working-
model of a Jules Yerne, cigar-shaped, under-sea
boat, invented by a Sydney man, was the most
solidly interesting thing on view—but, from a
butterfly standpoint, an organ playing “Faust,”
in a puffy sort of way, by electricity, and a man
cooking comestibles by the same “ disturbance of
molecular equilibrium,” as the scientists say, were
the airiest points about a very chippy outing.
I am sorry to see, too, that a lightning-grilled
chop can look just as coddled and sunburnt round
the edges as the less scientifically prepared victual,
and, with the keen consciousness of a dark and
hopeless culinary future, I regretfully noticed that
an electric muffin looks just as predisposed to turn
and rend you as any rule-of-thumb flap-jack in the
laud. Bub I think electric conversaziones ought
to be for men only. Tho’ there were music and
lightning-sketches and tea, still the women flagged
all round, and I don’t think a lady in pale grey
silk especially will attend another, for under the
remorseless glare of her electric-points her other-
wise undelectable make-up made her look as if her
cheeks had been dipped in mulberry-juice.
An epidemic of dances is upon us this month,
the most important being the always-popular St.
Vincent’s ball, on 7th inst, in Sydney Town Hall,
which promises to be a very gay affair under
creamy patronage. Mrs. J. T. Toohey and Miss
Mary Jennings are hon. secs., and the tickets are
going off with a pop. On Friday, 10th, the
annual ball of the East Sydney Rowing Club
takes place at West’s rooms and is almost sure to
be as hilarious as its predecessors. To-night
(Thursday) a Daffodil dance in aid of St. Francis’
Church takes the floor at the Paddington Town
Hall in the presence of Mayoress Manning, and on
30th Aug. a “violet” dance in aid of the Mater-
nity Home (Mrs. McManus and Miss M'Girr
hon. secs.) will probably attract a light-heeled
crowd.
One recent Sydney evening excitement was a
grand Military night at the Royal in aid of a 2nd
infantry reading and recreation-room, and held
under the aegis of Major Hutton, who was more of
an extinguisher on the proceedings than a crown
of glory. A clever programme had been drawn up
by the committee, bub the M.G. dashed his goose-
quill through item after item lest they should
detract from the success of the forthcoming
“ millinery ” manoeuvres, and the result was a
peptonised sort of entertainment eked out by
amateurs. It didn’t take four horses to carry
home the “gate.”
The newest thing unearthed in “ A Woman’s
Revenge,” Bland Holt’s final outbreak of realism
at Sydney Lyceum, was when Henrietta Watson
(whose incurable habit of letting herself loose
without a collar will give her pneumonia if she
tries it on at ’Ome) told Cosgrove that she
“ could only be a cousin to him.” Miss Watson,
whose stage wardrobe must be mounting sky-
high by this time, wore one good-looking yellow
dress nearly covered with cream lace and with big
yellow sleeves—just the right coloured gown to
play a jealous scene out in. But there isn’t much
scope for clothing in the drama, and really the
most desperately fashionable items were the black
velvet straps down the evening continuations of
Mr. Bland Holt, who seems to have struck the
secret of perennial youth, and is perkier every
time you see him.
Mrs. Bland Holt, as Lottie Bromley, was
brightly dressed in gladsome tints that suited the
complexion of the cheerful scenery in every
case. A gladiator-red gown with black satin
puffs was Mrs. Holt’s most successful toilet, but,
as I said before, “A Woman’s Revenge” is not
the sort of play to make a wardrobe-mistress turn
pale—the excitement rests with the scene-shifters.
At Sydney Lyceum on Saturday evening nearly
every lorgnette in the theatre was steadily aimed
’tween acts at the two artists’ models whom
J.C.W. has imported, regardless of expense, to
pose in the forthcoming tableaux vivants, which
will be sandwiched in during the opera season, for
the tableaux are not a whole show in themselves,
but require backing up on the bill. One of
the most effective pictures of the lot will
probably be the “Blind Girl of Pompeii,” in which
Miss Mona Rathbone—a Dianaesque sort of
damsel with faultless features, brown hair and
eyes, and a creamy skin like satin repp notepaper
(by gaslight at least)—has her best chance. Miss
Marie Rathbone, the other poseuse, has more pro-
nounced features, darker hair, and the shortest
upper lip I have ever seen. The physique of these
maidens is a nice change in a land of anaemia and
flat feet. Provided neither of the models sneezes
at a critical moment on the opening night, I take
it upon myself to prophesy that the tableaux will
be a boom from the beginning.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Molbourne Confidences.
Mklbouknk, July 31.
. Ever since the theatrical fete, the other Wed-
nesday, I have been haunted by recollections of a
heliotrope - complexioned woman who bloomed
upon a front bench of the members’ stand. The
artist who got the contract for facial repairs and
decorations must have mistaken lavender for pink
in mixing his colours. Or possibly the lady’s
natural epidermis, blue with cold, showing through
a too-transparent enamel coating, was responsible
for the phenomenon. In a fernery on a hot-wind
day she might have captured a very young man’s
imagination by her weird pallor, but it was not a
successful winter effect. One couldn’t help think-
ing of the “cold, strange eyes of a little mer-
maiden and the gleam of her golden hair," and
similar uncanny phases of female loveliness. It
was quite a relief to escape into the refreshment-
tents, for there the attendant nymphs were as rosy
as Nature intended them to be—in some cases,
perhaps, a little more so.
Nellie Stewart was, of course, the crowning
attraction, and very fetching she looked in dark-
green corded velvet shot with red in such a
manner as to throw over the surface of the
material a ruddy sheen like the reflection of fire-
light. The gown fitted Miss Ellen’s trim figure
like a glove, and a sweet French toque, of grass-
green velvet and Czar violets, nestled daintily
above a most successful version of the Princess
May fringe. In place of the wig-like point coming
down in the middle of the forehead, the same
effect was obtained by a soft, little centre-curl,
looking delightfully innocent and unpremeditated.
Florence Young was handsome and passive,
as usual, in blue serge, pink blouse and sailor
hat, and Ida Osborne looked better than
she has ever looked off the boards before,
in a black gown and dear little bonnet with
touches of green. Meanwhile, “Mr.” I. Osborne
was out in the open, bearing their infant daughter
aloft with much paternal pride.
The proprietresses of this spacious tent didnt
attempt to play down to the masses, but stood
entrenched behind their counter, giving all their
attention to the exigencies of a pushing trade.
The chieftainess showed that her eyes could flash
when an attendant mislaid a relay of spoons.
This anxiety to dispense her wares decently and
in order was a pleasing contrast to the free-and-
easy methods of some of the other tents, where
customers helped themselves to sugar with their
fingers and were smilingly requested to stir their
high-priced brews with pipe-stems or hat-pins as
the case might be.
Next door, May Pollard, cosy in soft, grey furs
and an artistic feathered hat, was in tune with
herself and all the world. Little Vi. Varley,
handicapped by the fact of a hubby and a rather
unbecoming brown frock, with petunia velvet
sleeves, apparently found the cigarette business
no sinecure.
In an adjoining booth, Maud Williamson, pale
and picturesque in unrelieved black, entertained
an admiring court, somewhat to the detriment of
the tea-traffic. A sister saleswoman, with pink
roses in her hat, stepped into the breach and
humanely fed the less interesting visitors, while
active Dora Mostyn, assisted by a very pretty
girl in green velvet (whom I discovered to be
Lilia Wilde, when I was told), worked with a will
behind the counter. Every shilling that poured
into the tills was profit, it seems. Light refresh-
ments, cigarettes and cigars had been contributed
to the Fund by Melb. firms, in open defiance of
ordinary business principles.
The first man to annex the degree of Litt. D.
(Doctor of Letters), lately created by Melb.
University, is now bent on studying Law. Un-
fortunately, he has access to no pocket but his
own poorly-lined one, and is, moreover, a newly-
wedded benedict. However, his bride, whose tastes
are equally intellectual, sympathises heart and soul
with his schemes for raising the wherewithal, and
has undertaken to preside over the book-shop they
have opened in a Melb. suburb, until hubby shall
have realised his ambition. Books required for
the various University courses, form a specialty
of the stock which, as a whole, has been chosen to
suit the needs of fellow-students, who are rolling
up in such force that J uliet is nearly run off her
feet.
The “Helping Hands” have apparently taken a
new lease of life. A few nights ago, in the home
suburb of one of the members, the company of
genteel strollers received quite an ovation. This
long-delayed recognition is said to have thawed
for the nonce the hauteur of the lavender-gloved,
crush-hatted manager, who, as a rule, finds his
only solace in inditing ironical letters to the Press.
The second part of the H.H. performance con-
sists of a rough-and-tumble rendering of “Trial
by Jury. ” G ilbert’s operatta inclines to burlesque
at any time, but if the chorus enunciated the
words so as to give point to their overpowering by-
play, and the soloists could make themselves
heard above the prevailing din, the H.H.
version wouldn’t be such arrant tomfoolery
as it is at present. The damsel cast for
the plaintiff had hitherto made unobtrusive
appearances at occasional amateur concerts. Em-
boldened by operatic experience, however, she has
taken to rendering her little ditties with vast play
of expression and variety of action. .The sayings
of Molloy’s “Waggoner” to his sweetheart, for
example, are emphasised by becoming little moves,
fancy eye-twinklings and coquettish tosses of the
head. All very pretty and “naughty,” no doubt,
but quite foreign to one’s conception of “ Carrier
John.”
1 have not come across anyone who has seen
Lady Hopetoun’s nose since the accident, but we
are loyally hoping for the best. The Age made a
rash announcement that the noble patient would
bob up serenely at some races, immediately after
leaving Dr. Fitzgerald’s private hospital. This
must have been the hypothesis of a man, probably
a reckless bachelor, who judged the case by the
recuperative powers of his own proboscis when it
has got damaged in action. The Countess, one
supposes, will consider herself “not presentable”
for some time to come, even though the bones be
just as they were, and the stitches have left very
little pinkness behind. Besides, she naturally
“funks” going abroad to be the object of a
“popular demonstration.” Lady Loch, the wily,
would have revelled in the opportunity, but this
diffident daughter of Erin, if the truth were
known, watches the recovery of her leading
feature with terror in her round, dark eye.
VAN M.
A great effort is being made to disfranchise
3000 Melb. rate payers under the Purification of
Rolls*Act. An unadulterated “ roll ” would con-
sist entirely of upper crust.
Wolseley has been made a British field-
marshal at the unusually early age of 61. Very
few British field-marshals attain their exalted rank
until they are 80 or more, and the post is generally
regarded as a reward for living till one doesn’t
know enough to die off out of the road.
Conan Doyle is wanted in Melbourne to
golve the mystery of the man at Scott’s hotel, who
is supposed to have suicided by stabbing him-
self thirteen times round the heart with a dagger,
which he subsequently replaced in its case. Then
he died. It was time.
Parkes to the last clung to the hope that
Governor Duff would pass over Reid’s undoubted
right to leadanewN.S.W. Ministry in favour of his
Hair. When that hope finally left him, he made
a great struggle to drape his toga decently. “Hi
ham very pleased hat being relieved from the
responsibility. Hi will never take hoffice again.”
Nasty, nasty grapes !
The sudden resignation of the Dibbs
Ministry was ostensibly brought about by the flat
refusal of Governor Duff to appoint seven new
Legislative Councillors. There are about a dozen
vacancies in the Council, and Dibbs claimed
the right to fill seven of these vacancies.
Governor Duff, however, refused, on no constitu-
tional grounds that can be discovered. According
to all precedent his conduct was unaccountable,
even English custom being entirely against him.
The first wedding has taken place at Cool-
gardie, and the local mining press rises to the
occasion. “ The bride wore a rich, creamy, quartz-
coloured silk. Miss Hickey was dressed in a
reddish substance, with ironstone-coloured leaders
running round the main body. Mrs. Feehan
wore a pale milky quartz combination, with gold
outcrops the full breadth of the face. Miss
Brennan waltzed round in a slate-coloured robe,
the principal outcrops being decorated with diorite-
coloured stringers, and other surface indications
of a highly-pleasing nature.”
Dear Bulletin, —Much of your Boldre-
wood criticism is doubtless correct, but he scarcely
deserves all your disparagement; for, although his
style may be cumbrous and his plots puerile, he
certainly scores with his descriptions of Australian
scenery, manners, and customs. The ruck of
Australian stories convey ridiculous ideas of this
country, as you know. Boldrewood is, at all
events, true to life. He could never pourtray a
character like North’s in “ His Natural Life,” but,
for all that, there are times when he carries an
Australian with him. Take, for example, the
night ride from Berrima gaol in “ Robbery Under
Arms,” or the death of the insurrectionist leader
in “ The Miner’s Right.” Many of his heroes are
commonplace, and his style is sometimes exe-
crable, but the truth of his descriptions more than
compensates for these defects,—Yours, H.A.
Vic. draper - diplomatist Reid probably
knows by this time that about 250 per cent, of
him is draper, and only the remainder diplo-
matist. The British authorities, it would seem,
accuse him of having blabbed to the smart
Yankees who are running the Hawaiian Govt.,
with the result that President Dole and Co. sent
out a steamer and annexed Necker Island, so
badly wanted as a depot by the new Imperial cable
company. Fresh from Downing-street, bursting
with vanity, Reid had to talk or die. The Hono-
lulu Yankees listened, and secured the prize,
which is now for sale at a fancy prize. Reid’s
knighthood is gone for ever.
Mr. Samuel Albert Rosa, the loud-
mouthed person who wrecked theN.S.W. Labour-
party at the Bar won, writes denying the state-
ment that had he been elected he could not have
taken his seat, and adding that he was not run by
any clique, but was “the duly selected candidate
of the Bar won branch of the L.E.L., the members
of the branch relying upon Macdonnell’s frequent
written promise that he would not oppose but
would assist their candidate.’’ The idea of Mac-
donnell, who scored over 500 and came within
two votes of winning the seat, having promised
not to oppose but to assist the miserable outsider
who could only scrape up 43 suffrages all told, is a
beautiful specimen of cheek. Also, the idea of
this latter obscure straggler claiming to be the
“duly selected candidate” of the party which
■voted so unanimously for the other man is still
more excellent. Mr. Rosa’s services to the N.S.W.
Democratic-party are that, with no reasonable
chance of winning himself, he split the Labour-
vote just enough to prevent the real Labour-can-
didate getting in, and The Bulletin trusts that
the fact will be duly remembered wherever and
whenever this blatant person again offers his
help to the country. . . ...


The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency
Co., Limited, reports :
Wool.— ln the local market a satisfactory business has
been done during the past week at firm prices. Supplies
have consisted principally of scoured skin wools, which
realised from 10Jd. to lljd. per lb. for top sorts of good
average quality and condition, and up to 14|d. per lb.
for very superior clean-washed samples. The London
sales (fourth series) closed on 25th ult. without any further
change in values. Altogether, 216,000 bales were sold
during the series, and 78,000 bales have been held over
for future disposal. The fifth series of sales will com-
mence in the home market on 18th September.
Note. —Mrs. Parkes and her family have been
residing in Gisborne the last 30 years, and the
witness to the signature is the wife of the Rev.
Mcßride, Wesleyan Minister, of Kyneton.

Another old Hawkesbury native, Wm.

at Windsor, N.S.W., last week. He never once
in all his long life left the locality where he was

A curious thing about the denunciation of
spiritualistic humbug in Argus leaders is the way
they have covertly sneered at James Smith, a
veteran member of the Argus staff, who is also a
spookite.
Douglas Sladen is now on the staff of
Jerome K. Jerome’s piratical paper, To-Day,

Governor Robinson
made memorable his re-
cent visit to Melbourne
for the Guvmentouse
males, by the number
and turquoise brilliancy
of the anecdotes he re-
tailed. William has an
unrivalled collection of
yarns, all of which are
of too pronounced a
character to be used
even as gags for his next
comic opera.
The reigning beauty
in Melb. now is Mrs.
Morris (a daughter of Dr.
Wilmott, of Butchers’-
row), who is really, with-
out exaggeration, a. won-
derfully lovely woman —
with the kind of beauty
about which poets rhapso-
dise and painters rave.
She is said to be in-
tellectual, too. She has
a slightly-aquiline nose,
a prominent chin, fine
eyes, and an apple-blos-
som skin. Her husband
is partner in a firm of
wholesale ironmongers.
The Bulletin hears
from London that “ A
Yellow Aster,” in the
first week of its 7s. 6d.
edition, sold—7ooo copies.
The authoress, in that
week, netted .£825, and
yet she says the only real
pleasure she has derived
from the book was the
chance to “ cut dead ” a
Melbourne moneyed snob
who was once rude to her.
Young Kir ton, M.P. for Ballarat (Vic.),
was one night strutting about the Parliamentary
lobbies in a new suit, presented to him by the pro-
prietors of the Ballarat cloth mills. He was
desirous of doing the firm a good turn and so
solicited the opinion of everybody as to the suit.
At last he met a well-known pressman, and can-
vassed him for a compliment. “What do you
think of this for Ballarat make?” he said. “Well,
Kirton, to tell you the truth,” replied the genial
journalist, “ I think it a slop-made suit on a slop-
made man.”
Up to date not one of the Agents-General
who have represented S. A. in London have lived
to return to Adelaide.
Living S.A. knights are: Ayers, Coles,
Colton, Davenport, Downer, Elder, Milne, Smith
and Todd, with Baker, two Boothbys and Goyder
as O.M.G.’s. Those who have carried their
baubles to the tetter land are: Blyth, Bray,
Fisher, Hughes, Hanson, Jeffcot, Kingston,
Morphett, Morgan, Rosa and Torrens, with Hart
in the alleged lower grade.
Forster is one of Melbourne’s noblemen.
Twelve years ago, he started his Try Excelsior
Society, described as being in Toorak, but really
over the border in democratic Prahran, and
devoted to the welfare of poor boys. It is really
marvellous what he has accomplished. He never
seeks newspaper commendation, and very seldom
gets it. Now he has 500 boys.
G. P. Smith, the man whom Supple tried
to shoot, was once talking in Vic. Assembly when
gigantic Patrick Hanna, member for Moama,
became offensive in interrogation. Turning to
the dignified Charles Macmahon, the orator
said : “Mr. Speaker, I would esteem it a favour
if you would silence the grand P. Hanna of the
Assembly.” Then there was a laugh which
effectively shut up the Irishman.
Law, Labour M.L.A, for Balmain South —
pledge brand—is selling off his drapery business,
and lately said to a Sydney pressman : “Try a
cheap hat, you’ve a big head and this is the last
I’ve left —couldn’t find a customer, for the people
about here have very small heads.” “ That
accounts for the fools they made of themselves
last Tuesday,” said the scribe, then unaware that
he was addressing the people’s elected.
The story goes, says “ Will Honeycomb,”
that, on the way over from America, a young
fellow-passenger approached Pastor Talmage and
told him that many people on board would take it
as a favour if he would give them a lecture. “ I
guess,” said the Doctor, carefully surveying his
interviewer from head to foot, “I guess, young
man, you’ve come to fish in the wrong pond.”
“ I think not,” said the latter, “ the mistake is in
my having failed to use the right bait.”
M‘iNeill, the travelling preacher, is taking
the wind out of Talmage’s sails in Melbourne. He
has a “singing evangelist,” one Burke, with him.
On their first appearance they secured the Con-
gregational church, and so many people rolled up
that they had to put some into the Presbyterian
church opposite, and conduct a service there.
Burke officiated at both churches, dodging back-
wards and forwards and singing furiously. The
Town Hall was then engaged, and as it is found
that that will not hold the people, the Exhibition
has been hired. If that won’t hold them —well,
perhaps the Lord will provide.
Parkes, presiding at a pump lecture en-
titled “O, sir, it was the drink that did it!”: —
I have entered my 80th year, and feel strong and
healthy, because I have lived an abstemious life. I lived
to the age of 30 without knowing the taste of strong
drink, and I attribute my health to this abstemiousness
in early life. ... If you study Dr. Ward Richard-
son’s book you will see that human nature only wants one
beverage, and that is water.
This is the old gentleman who takes wine for
his stomach’s sake every day of his life.
This is the man of whom a co-banqueter
once told The Bulletin: “By Jove! I don’t

believe anybody or anything could make him
drunk. I poured three big bottles of cham-
pagne into him during the evening. He drank
every drop, and then got up sober as a judge, and
made by far the best speech.” This is the
old boy who only the other night, parading after
the poll, went publicly into an hotel for “ refresh-
ment ” —which wasn’t water. The world is easily
humbugged.

A Sydney shopkeeper couldn’t get a
tobacconist to pay up a “little account,” .£45.
So he wrote suggesting that the latter should send

note.” “Yes? But I didn’t get my tobacco.”

Once more the field of magazine writing is

attempting to run a similar venture. Jerome (not

Travelling from Brisbane to Maryborough
(Q.) by train some time ago, at every station the
wild and hairy Labour-member, Hoolan, was seen
parading with a squalling infant. By-and-bye,
the Mary River bad to be crossed by boat, the
bridge being down, and Hoolan with the baby
and a load of parcels was followed by a woman
with a couple more howling children. On reach-
ing Maryborough, the woman, a local resident,
asked Tooth, M.P., the name of her unknown
chevalier. “Hoolan,” he explained. “And,”
remarks Nicholas Tooth, “that woman’s husband
has to vote the Labour-ticket now.”
M'Burney, Wallis & Co.’s Report.
The bulk of wool offered this week consisted of scoured.
Only a few lots of greasy came under the hammer, this
being the moat “ off ” month of the off season.
From a cable just received from our London agents we
gather that the Rite rise of about one-halfpenny per
pound is sustained for medium and first-class light-condi-
tioned greasy wool. Heavy and inferior being a little
easier.
Latest news from America is not quite so encouraging,
but it is still probable the free admission of wool to the
United States will, in the near future, be an accomplished
fact.
Shearing is progressing without impediment, and
already buyers are beginning to scent the new wool far
off, and are eager to pay good prices for any early lots
they can pounce upon.
We hope growers who hitherto have shipped to London
will try the Sydney market in the coming season. So
much has been written on this point that owners must see
the wisdom of selling here. Those who wish to read up
the subject we refer to our “Wool Growers’ Annual,”
which we will forward anywhere free, and to the able
articles recently appearing in the Wool and Produce
Journal.
Sydney, 27th July, 1894.
From Jan. 1 to May 5, ’94, there were 50
lynchings in the U.S. —the victims being always
negroes. The general Southern excuse is that
the whites are roused to madness by offences
against women, but in 41 Southern cases only 9
alleged crimes came in this class, the others being
mostly trivial offences. Procedure varies. Some-
times the lynchers soak a man with kerosene, stick
him full of splinters, and set fire to him ; some-
times they put a woman in a cask stuck with nails
and roll her downhill. The perpetrators of these
outrages are never brought to justice. “’Tis the
star-spangled banner, O long may it wave o’er the
land of the free and the home of the brave.”
Dion Boucicault’s
brother, Arthur Leslie
Bouroicault (he insisted on
spelling it with an “ r”)
died in Sydney last week—
-72. He was on Melb.
Argus in the forties;
founded Rockhampton
Argus when the Port
Curtis rush broke out; sold
out, and bought a brewery;
sold out, and bought Gym-
pie Miner ; sold out, and
bought Shepparton (Vic.)
Argus ; burnt out, and
bought a little Burwood
(Syd.) paper, which he was
running when he died. In
his youth he had a pretty
wit; and even later he
crushed one loathsome con-
temporary by calling the
editor —a sour, lank man
—“a walking emetic.”
He knew to a penny what
a newspaper should cost to
produce, and invariably
saved the penny. Travel-
ling showmen revered his
name, and always gave
him their dodgers.
A Frenchman has
been imported to London
to help Burney Young in
the management of S.A.
Wine and Produce Depot,
and it is suggested that his
spare hours shall be de-
voted to teaching dancing
and deportment to Agent-
General Playford, so that
that official “may do
credit to his country at
Court functions.” It is
’further affirmed that, apro-
pos of recent verbal indis-
cretions, Premier Kingston
wrote a hurried note in
these words to his ancient
crony—“ Dear Tom, —For
God’s sake hold your blanky jaw ! ”
Dear Bulletin, —There is just now a
great outcry against the Sydney publican who
“puts a bead on” his inferior liquor by adul-
terating it with sulphuric acid. Yet all the
sulphuric acid necessary to perform that service
for a bottle of snakejnice would be perfectly harm-
less. Sulphuric acid is an A 1 refrigerant, stimu-
lant, digestive, and several other nice things. The
real trouble is not with the small modicum of acid
sold. It is with the vile, unrectified white spirit,
full of horrible impurities and methylated jim-
jams. “ Them’s my sediments.” —Yours, H.C.
To Our Wives and Mothers.
The health of woman is the foundation of beauty.
Good health insures beautiful symmetrical lines
and forms, the healthy and blooming appearance,
which even brings charm to irregular features.
Beauty without health is impossible, conse-
quently it is obvious that women should pay
greatest attention to retain good health. Un-
fortunately, women are greatly exposed to dis-
orders which cause untold suffering and prevent
them from fulfilling their home, as well as social,
duties, making life a burden. >
The greatest medical authorities teach that
female troubles would not occur if the kidneys
and liver were kept in a healthy condition. It
would be useless to attempt to cure female diseases
without removing the actual cause. Warner’s
Safe Cure, in establishing a healthy action of
the kidneys and liver, and neutralising the
poisonous acids in the blood —the cause of all in-
flammation, removes the germ of ulceration,
abscesses, &c. This remedy is, therefore, invalu-
able in the successful treatment of all female com-
plaints, and its virtue is proclaimed by Mrs.
Eliza Parkes, of Gisborne, victoria, under date
May 26th, 1894, who states : —“About six years
ago I was taken very ill, and was confined to my
bed for several months, being attended by the
doctor who resided here at that time, whom I
believe to be a very clever and skilful physician,
and most certainly a very careful and attentive
one. After doing all he could for me, he gave me
no hope whatever of my recovering, and stated
that I was suffering from diseased kidneys, the
liver also was in a very bad state, the action of
the heart very weak and the blood very poor, and
which he termed similar to molasses. My legs
were swollen to a very great size. Having heard
from friends about your Safe Cure, I determined
to try it. I bought one bottle at a time, and found
it was doing me good, so I continued taking it,
and after having taken several bottles was able to
get out of bed. Still continuing the medicine I
soon became strong enough to get about as well as
ever I was. This I consider a wonderful cure, as
my age is now 76 years, and I have not had the
least symptoms of the old complaint since I left
off taking the medicine. I informed the doctor
that I was using Warner’s Safe Cure, and he
recommended me to continue, as he said it was
a very good medicine.”

The forfcy-eighthday
of the second Speight v.
Symecasefound Wheeler,
M.L. A., ex-Minister of
Railways, denying that
Speight was dismissed
at the command of the
Age. Guileless Wheeler
really can’t say whether
the almighty penny rag
had influenced political
matters, and he
(Wheeler !) attaches the
same importance to the
Age as to the Licensed
Victuallers’ Gazette.
Half-an-hour was wasted
in a cross-examination
of Wheeler’s profound
ignorance, yet Speight’s
counsel retrained from at-
tempting a home thrust.
He might have reminded
Wheeler that Speight
was “suspended” in a
violent hurry directly
after he had issued a
writ against Syme, and
he might have read one
of Deakin’s parliamen-
tary speeches, describing
the Shiels regime as
“ Government by a news-

The Aiiaps
The Suffrage!is not a right, but it is a privilege.
Likewise, breathing is ,not a right, it is a privi-

Also, listening to Tory twaddle is not an inflic-

Nesbit, Q.C., the Adelaide lawyer, is still
in London, .and it is suggested that, acting on a
Ministerial tip, lie is waiting for the Privy Coun-
cil appeal in re the boundary dispute with Vic-
toria, which S. A. Assembly has decided shall be
settled by legal means if negotiations fail.
Among other.S. A. economies, the penny-
a-day good-service allowance has been taken from
the police, who also lose, as before stated, their
periodical Sunday leave. What makes the par-
tiality of the penalty more apparent is that by the
influence of the Labour members all other workers
at less than £l5O a year—both on the pro. tem.
and the fixed lists—in the railway workshops
and other Government employment are totally
exempt from any retrenchment under the Public
Salaries Bill.
No inconsiderable factor in the defeat of
Millionaire Burdekin for the Hawkesbury was
the vote of the newly-established Pitt Town
Labour Settlement. Mr. Burdekin, now out m
the cold, has not and never had any-
thing to recommend him but his geni-
ality and his money. His successful
opponent, attorney Morgan, will never
be a Talleyrand or a Disraeli, but he
sings nicely and that’s something.
Burdekin for years acted as fairy
godmother to the “Great N.S.W. Freetrade
Party,” which he boarded and lodged and found
in drinks. Also, he paid for the ironing of the
Great N.S.W. Freetrade Party’s hat and the
patching of its clothes, and for levelling its
boot-heels. What has happened to Burdekin
by reason of the settlement in his electorate of a
labour-colony, is shortly going to happen to Mr.
Staughton, the holder of a Victorian pocket-
borough.
Kingsbury, M.L.A. (Q.): k ‘A man of 31
has 10 years more experience than a man of 21,
and I think he should, therefore, have a second
vote.” Also, a man of 51 has 30 years more ex-
perience than a man of 21, and should, conse-
quently (on this basis), be entitled to four votes.
Logic is logic.
Mahomet and the Mountain once more.
The Argus actually sought out the once-despised
Trenwith for his opinion of the N.S.W. elections.
The would-be Radical-cum-Conservative journal
almost recognises Trenwith as the real Opposition
leader now, and reports him far more freely than
has been its wont.
The S.A. Assembly is divided into parties
thus : The Speaker, the Chairman of Committees,
11 Ministerialists, including five members of the
Govt., the Whip, 21 legislators belonging to the
“ Independent Country Party,’’ 10 Labour-m 'in-
ters, seven Oppositionists, two Independent mem-
bers and Bartlett.
In view of the Parkes blight threatening,
it is well to remember some of the men who helped
to constitute the Parkes Govt, in 1887 : Mil burn
Creek Garrett, A. B. Co. Abigail, Hornsby Burns,
Anglo-Australian Clarke, and so on. Ye gods !
And what Parkes has done once he would do
again if he dared and could.
Jawbone Neild’s barrackers must be funny
dogs. They sprang a “ surprise ’’-party on him
the other night by singing “ Wait till the turn of

Wales general election, hadn’t got “surprise
enough when he found that the tide had turned
—dead against him at the poll.
Michael Duffy, M.P. for Bundaberg and
ex-ferry boatman, has made himself briefly famous
in Q. Assembly by enunciating this opinion
“With so many heirs to the throne, I hardly
know why the Duke of York’s son should call tor
special recognition in the Speech ; but, as a loyal
subject, I congratulate their Royal Highnesses on
the birth of a son.”
Purves, farewelling to Justice Hood, puts
forth the old fallacy a thousand times knocked on
the head. The judges, he says, should nut be
retrenched, because they give up such magnificent

Forty-five National Ass candidates were
returned at last N.S. W. election, and 52 were
rejected. The Ass, however, adopted candidates
without their permission, and many of them,
when they heard that they had been cursed by its
support, repudiated it and all its works, so it is
difficult to decide whether the animal has been
successful or not.
A correspondent: — Though the N.S.W.
Freetraders had in several electorates four, five and
even six candidates running for the one seat, they
did not lose one seat by the splitting of votes in
such electorates. The Protectionists, on the other
hand, lost eight seats through the multiplicity of
candidates—the elected men in these electorates
represent the minority.—F.T.
The declaration of Arthur Griffith, newly-
elected member for Waratah, “ that the N.S.W.
Labour-party would support Beelzebub himself if
he promised and could give the reforms de-
manded,” corresponds exactly with the historical
statement of George Black when first elected to
N.S.W. Assembly, that the Labour-party’s policy
Was “support in return for concessions.”
Talmage’s statement that Freetrade is
best suited to some countries and Protection to
others, according to their circumstances, has in-
furiated “ Outis,” of Sydney D.T., who calls Tal-
mage many different kinds of language. “ Outis’s”
theory evidently is that the same treatment applies
in every case, whether the patient has fallen over-
board from a ship or has been bitten by a horse.
It is characteristic of Vic. Premier Patter-
son that while he justifies the payment of huge
pensions for very scanty services to absentees like
Childers, Duffy, and Andrew Clarke, because of
the ill-effect which default might have on the
British pawnbroker, he contemplates repudiation
in the case of public officials who have worked
hard for 40 or 50 years, because they are under his
thumb. The butcher, the braggart, and the syco-
phant are manifest in many of his actions.

Dear Bulletin, —Re S.A. landsales. A
few weeks ago a block of GOOO acres of good land
well watered, improved, and within the line ot
coastal rains—was hawked about at 225. Gd. an
acre. The Govt, received far more money for it
in the fifties. Last week the Govt, had an offer of
65,000 acres of first-class agricultural land-fenced
in and improved close to a town and railway—the
price asked being the money paid them 40 years
ago by the owner’s uncle when the land was 50
miles from town and without a railway. ihose
who have been howling about the “unearned in-
crement” are dead against the purchase as it
would upset their pet schemes. The owner
doesn’t ask for cash, but will take Treasury 4 per
cent, bonds. Please let this go down per contra.—

In acknowledging an address from some
school girls the other day the ancient fox, Parkes,
pathetically spoke of “ the snows of 80 years
as if the snows of 80 years were not now and liad
not long been almost his whole stock-in-trade.
The other night, after the polling, he was carted
round Sydney by Joey Carruthers and Barney
Wise to show the “ snows ” aforesaid and to indi-
cate that at least one cartload of the Parkes
Ministry was quite ready. The snows caused
great enthusiasm and were loudly cheered as the
old man lifted his tile and showed the bald patch.
As The Bulletin has frequently said, clip and
shave Parkes and you’ll solve the political difficul-
ties of N.S.W. within five minutes. By the way,
H.P. in the letter to the aforesaid school-girls
speaks gloomily of his “ nearness to the grave.
Which would lead some people to believe that he
wasn’t quite so sure of shoo-ing off G. H. Reid
from the Foreign-trade leadership, as he gammoned
to be in public.
A pair of parsons dining at a fashion-

really for Storey ; and the Baptist and Pres-
byterian dogmas were alike forgotten in the
heat of quarrel about the alleged treachery.
Dear Bulletin, —Dr. Bachelor, of
Dunedin (M.L.), ascribes drunkenness to
an organic defect in the brain, but pro
phesies that the disease is dying out as
humanity progresses in development. He
further theorises that, if prohibition shou d
stamp out drunkenness, it will cause the
general cultivation of other vices in the
stead of drunkenness. But, _as far as I
have scope to judge, experience prove-
that prohibition has never yet stamped
out drunkenness, but, rather, has multi-
plied it exceedingly. From various statis-
tics that have dazzled my admiration 1
feel inclined to lay down this natural Jin-
de-siecle law:—Drunkenness increases in
the ratio of the cube of the volume of
prohibition applied against it. —Yours,

O’Loghlen’s Judgeship has been a rod in
pickle, in Victoria, these ten years, and it is w*_l!
to settle, once for all, that the people never will
stand such an imposition. The Tubby Kerb-r<i
job savors yet. O’Loghlen is in no way qualified
for a judge. All the brethren of the bench will
rise up against him, and every barrister, led by
Purves. These political appointments are a curse.
Another thing, O’Loghlen would get sick on hard
work, sooner than Williams, Hood, or any oi
them. If Judge Holroyd retires, give him kud. s
for sticking to his work” like the traditional good
old Molesworth and Higinbotham. The idea is
to get the lumbering four-decker, O’Loghlen, in
for half a year during Hood’s holiday, then for
life, on Holroyd’s retirement.
A candidate for a N.S.W. country seat
deputed two local residents to act as stipendiary
scrutineers for him at two outside polling-places—
giving them, at the same time, most explicit in
structions to lodge their votes in his (the candi-
date’s) favour, ere taking their seats in the booth.
When the returns came in, the candidate found,
by reason of the figure 0 against his name at both
places, that neither scrutineer had voted for him—
each, no doubt, having hoped that at least one
elector would vote for “ the boss ” and thus save
their perfidy from being discovered. But, quite
unabashed, each scrutineer sent in a polite note
requesting a guinea for attendance. Did they
get it? The candidate smiled, and returned to
Sydney.

That tragi comedian, the evangelist, is
round again. Evangelista and clergy secretly
hate each other, despite all their demonstrations
of affection. Between the lines of an evangelist’s
speech, there can always be discerned a sneer at
the clergy, doing their puddle-horse mill routine
of work. The Evangelist, starring around, has
certain purple-patched orations, which he delivers
everywhere, and then people grumble because
their hard-wrought parson cannot speak the same
way all the year. So the parson says—to his
wife—that the evangelist is a humbug, after
which he has to go and crawl to the Rev. Pan-
jandrum.

Sydney Presbyterian thrift suffered a
shocking set-back at the hands of Talmage. What
Tabnage has in common with Presbyterianism is
not very clear, but, anyhow, the Presbyterians
were going to take him up and protect him from
the other denominations which yearned to have a
finger in the lion’s pie. So a grand ceremonial
reception was to be held in St. Stephen’s church,
and hundreds of free tickets were distributed to
Presbyterian pillars in every congregation. But
as soon as Talmage—or was it His Grace the Most
Rev. Bishop R. S. Sinythe?—heard how the cream
was to be taken off his half-crown lecture on the
following night, he gently, but firmly, intimated
that he could not appear. The rage of the intend-
ing deadheads was something awful. It is clear
that Talmage has a good deal in common with
Presbyterianism. lie hasn’t come to Australia
for the good of his health.

A sailor and his girl went to a Sydney
church to be married the other day. “ But you
haven’t brought a witness,” said the minister.
Well, they hadn’t thought of the witness. “Never
mind, my wife will be witness.” And she was.
When t'ne ceremony was over, the couple paid the
fee and turned to go. “Five shillings more,

always gets five shillings as witness.” “Well,
I’m !” said the sailor.

A Sydney suburban curate lately an-
nounced a lecture on “ Wit and Humour ” at the
local hall, and, as the shepherd had a poor salary
and was much respected, nearly everyone in the
parish bought a couple of tickets in order to make
the thing a pecuniary success. _ When the time
arrived, however, wit was not in evidence, as the
lecture never eventuated. Of humour grim
humour—there was plenty, for only one person
rolled up. All the others who had bought tickets
had reckoned upon someone else putting in an
appearance!

Gov. Hopetoun :—“ Ido not think God would have sent
us into the world if He did not intend us to be happy.”
When the wind blows through the crannies and
the rain falls through the roof,
And you find in baby faces looks of sorrow and
reproof;
When the cupboard’s gaping empty, and in pawn
your goods are stored,
Don’t forget the Lord’s intentions as delivered by
the lord.
When the rent is overdue, and you-are dunned for
the amount,
And the man who sells the firewood wants a trifle
on account,
And the wife has got rheumatics, and the doctor’s
got the huff,
Kick your heels and dance a breakdown —’tis a sin
to cut up rough.
Though you’ve tramped both town rnd country,
seeking work that none will give,
And you can’t escape the puzzle: “ How the deuce
are we to live ? ”
Ne’er allow your mind to linger on the rifle or the
rope.
But remember still the beautiful and joyous creed
of Hope.
He has palaces and riches, and his children never
know
What it is to starve and suffer, and the keen
winds never blow
On their unclad limbs in winter; who should
better know than he
How good is God—how happy He intended us to
be?
Perchance upon the fruitful earth the great
Jehovah meant
That His toiling, sinning children should have
plenty and content;
But if so the time is with us when the keen edge
of His sword
Should smite the class that trifles with the wishes
of the Lord.

By 22 votes to 20, S.A. Assembly has

foolish theft from that idiotic country Maoriland ;
and Caldwell, the original advocate for giving

One Sydney bank was not represented at
the “bankers’ night,” at the Criterion Theatre,
last Thursday evening—whereby hangs a tale.
The decree which forbids this bank’s officials from
attending such functions, dates back to the halcyon
days of Mrs. Brown-Potter and Kyrle Bellew’s
season at Sydney Royal. On a certain memorable
night, during their season, a party of bank-clerks
engaged, for a stiff sum, the whole of the family-
circle and cleared a goodly amount by sub-letting
seats to fellow-clerks. Then the question arose —
vvliat to do with the balance? and one bright
genius proposed a banquet to the lovely
“Cora.’' Few who attended will forget that
banquet, and to this day many a bank-
clerk proudly exhibits a plate or a cup
or a saucer, on the back of which “ Cora ’
has scrawled some very tender sentiments. Each
banqueter took away some bit of crockery or other
on that occasion, and the caterer’s bill for broken
and missing china was something enormous.
When the revellers awoke to a sore head under
the table the enchanted spell rudely broke; the
lovely “ Cora ” had disappeared, and nothing in
particular remained but the sore head and the
lillets-doux on the cbinaware. Then each sadly
placed a bit of crockery under his coat and, in the
dim morning, silently stole away. When news
of the orgie reached a certain pompous general-
manager the fiat went forth that, in future, any
of the bank’s officials found taking part in any
similar functions would be instantly dismissed.
Consequently, Sydney “bankers’ theatre-parties”
are not what they used to be.

with popular audiences.” This, by the way,
is especially good as corning from a print which
has so many stereotyped newspaperese phrases on
hand about ‘‘constitutional procedure” and “the
legitimate investment of capital” and “sound
Government,” and the like. But the really in-
teresting feature of the letter is the writer’s ex-
pressions of his utter loathing for Premier Dibbs
who afterwards became his Nemesis and hanged
him. Probably Cummings had no premonition
when he wrote that Dibbs would ultimately hang
him, but the coincidence is grotesque all the same.
He also expresses an utter detestation of Parkes
and Reid, and if he had murdered his banker a
few weeks later one of them probably have
hanged him instead of Dibbs, which would have
been another coincidence. _ Cummings was ap-
parently a man of many possible coincidences.

A policeman at Melb. City Court the other
day was ordered to fetch the Koran, on which a
Mahommedan was to be sworn. The zealous and

formation that “ sich a person” was not in the
vicinity “av th’ coort.”

THE UNIVERSAL PRAYER,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I ask Thee not, O gracious Lord,
For prize of power or rich award ;
I ask Thee not for tongue of flame
To fire my Muse and spread ray fame;
No laurel crown do I desire,
To no dim heights my hopes aspire;
Not mine the quenchless lust of gain,
Not mine the wish to rule and reign,
But here in peace and calm content
To Heaven my poor petition’s sent—
Give me, O Thou whom mortals bless
(For one small want I must confess),
Give me—to crown my .happiness—
A little more than I possess.

“ Heathens are people who don’t quarrel
over religion.”
Parkes has been bombarded with con-
gratulations on the attainment of his 79th birth-
day last Sunday. A Sydney D.T. interviewer
went with a blithesome, springy step to dive into
the old man’s recollections of infancy, and ex-
tracted much information regarding his capacity
for goo-goo utterance and mud-pie manufac-
ture. Singularly enough, however, the veteran
omitted the one thing material, and did not say
that he owes his strength and health, under Pro-
vidence, to a judicious use of Marshall s lonic
Nervine, sold at corner of Pitt and Park streets,
Sydney.
DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHAT IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad Aide for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you? Will you do your business at

yOU, of course, want the highest quality of tone, action,
JL touch and beauty of exterior you can afford; but
you must have durability. Durability is an indispensable
condition, and however cheap an instrument may appear,
without durability it is worthless. Avoid the cheap
pianos, for which there are agents in every town, who tell
—and often through ignorance believe —that they are
equal to the Steinway or the Erard or some other first-
class maker. Therefore, no matter tiow big a bargain you
think somebody else offers, investigate

Some years ago, a well-
known Sydney Police Court
practitioner and a high legal
luminary had arranged for a
day’s fishing at Manly. The
practitioner was most anxious
to get awa'y to catch his boat,
but had to prosecute some
dozen Italian fishermen for
fishing in close waters. The
swarthy offenders were ranged
side by side in the dock
“ How do they plead ?” asked
the Magistrate, and forthwith
a torrent of jargon proceeded
from each offender anxious t"
assert his innocence. “What’s
that they say ?" enquired the
Magistrate, also eager to g<>
fishing at once. “They all
plead guilty, your Worship,’
replied the alleged lawyer,
hurriedly putting on his ha*
and coat and looking at hit
watch. “Twenty shillings, or
seven days,” said the beak,
gathering up his quart of
prawns from beneath the seat
of justice, and amidst the
clamorous expostulations of
the Italians the legal gentle-
men rushed out of Court and
went fishing.

A London firm of publishers advertises a
new book about Thunderbolt, the bushranger, and
says that “the presence of an English lancer in
Bendigo as police officer is a guarantee that love
and sport find their proper place in this Austra-
lian tale.” But for the English lancer the Eng-
lish public would evidently have its doubts. The
last English lancer the writer ran across lived in
W. Queensland. He claimed to have been adju-
tant of a regiment, and chiefly passed his time
in fishing, while his harem of black-gins provided
’possum and sweet potatoes. (Love and sport, to
be sure !) He brewed a kind of spirit from his
sweet potatoes, and with that and tobacco cadged
from passing swagmen, he managed to get along.
Probably there are lots of similar English lancers
strewn over the provinces, helping to build up
Australian civilisation.

Indigestion
may be the result of a variety of causes, debility
of the digestive tract, over mental work, nervous
prostration, excessive smoking, tea, or spirit
drinking. At any rate, no matter what the
•ause, the only treatment of any permanent benefit
is a restorative treatment, theremedy must possess
conic, invigorating and strengthening properties.
This is not the case with any of the many purging
mixtures sold as dyspepsia panaceas, and this is
proved by their makers stating that the dose must
be increased until the desired effect is attained.
This is due to the nostrum being purely a cathar-
tic, and by continued use the stomach, liver, and
bowels become educated to the action of the
medicine and it gradually loses all effect.
Clements Tonic is quite distinct in its action, it
assists digestion, promotes the flow of gastric
and pancreatic fluids, increases the secretion of
bile and thus assists the bowels to throw off the
waste matter; it strengthens the nerves, forms
bone, muscle and nerve tissue, and increases the
appetite. Clements Tonic is a natural restorative
of a debilitated system. Read the case of Mr.
William W. Brown, Inspector W. and S. Board,
Gowrie-street, Newtown, who writes on Dec. 28th,
1892 :—For about two years I have been a severe
sufferer from biliousness and indigestion, with
constant attacks of dizziness, in fact, I have been
at times incapacitated from following my daily
avocations as a Government Inspector. At times
when seized with dizziness I have had to sit down
to keep myself from falling. Hearing so much
about the nerve-strengthening qual i ties of Clements
Tonic, I resolved to give it a trial, which I have
done with the most beneficial results. I had only
taken two bottles when I found myself thoroughly
cured. lam only too happy to add my testimony
to the number already received-—Wishing you
every success, and a happy new year, I r< main,

The Australian Joint Stock Bank, Limited.
HALF-YEARLY MEETING OF PROPRIETORS, THURSDAY, 26th JULY, 1894.
Chairman’s Address.
Gentlemen,—l am glad to be able to oongratu-
ate the Shareholders on the strong position of
the Bank. The Directors have thought it de-
sirable to keep very much larger reserves than
seemed necessary in the past.
2. The reserves of Coin and Cash balances
amount to £1,258,206 6d., which more
than covers all moneys payable on demand, and
we have in London £241,100 invested in British
Government Consols and our own Government
Securities.
3. Further Inscribed Stock has been taken up
to the extent of £36,641, bringing the total up
to £385,464. F
The New Fixed Deposits on
31st December last amounted to £183,361 0 0
This has been reduced by re-
payment to the Queensland
Government of 130,000 0 0
being the amount lodged in
Treasury Notes for circulation
by the Bank, leaving £53,361 0 0
to which has been added new
Deposit Money received during
the past six months M ... 84,643 0 0
Making ... .£137,904 0 0
as stated in the Balance Sheet.
4. On 20th April, 1893, the
indebtedness to Depositors of
the old Bank was ’.. £8,498,589 16 11
The amount now to be repaid is 7,526,269 2 0
The difference being £972,320 14 11
The reduction has been made as follows :
We have Inscribed Stock,
chiefly arising from the conver-
sion of Fixed Deposit Receipts,
amounting to ... £385,464 2 7
and we have acquired from sales
of property, debts paid, &0.,
Fixed Deposit Receipts amount-
ing to ... 586,856 12 4
so that in a little over a year we
have thus provided ... ... £972,320 14 11
towards the debts due to the Depositors in the
old Bank, and including advances to customers on
the security of Fixed Deposits the amount exceeds
a million.
5. The amount of new Share Capital called up
is .£308.284;, and the sum received, including
Calls paid in advance, amounts to £332,810
155., and there are unpaid Calls amounting to
■£14:,920. Besides this, there are the Calls on
2500 shares not yet allotted, but this number is
1388 less than it was six months ago, and we expect
that all will be arranged for.
6. There has b;en a considerable reduction in
the expenses owing in a great measure to the
closing of a number of branches which ceased to
be profitable.
7. Considering the general shrinkage the busi-
ness of the Bank has been well maintained, and
could have been enlarged had satisfactory seeuri-
ties been offered. Great care is being exercised in
taking new business and in the conduct of the
affairs of the Bank generally.
8. The late panic and its consequences, as well
as the uncertainty with regard to the land laws,
have affected the value of all our securities, but
there is in most cases an ample margin, and as
regards those not fully covered it is believed that
the sum set aside to provide for the losses of the
old Bank will be found ample, a reasonable time
being allowed for realisation.
9. Interest on Fixed Deposit Money. We are
paying interest on the deposits of the old Bank at
the rate of 4£ per cent., but the present rate for
deposits for 12 months is 4 per cent., and there is
a prospect of a further reduction. The reduction
will probably lead to the withdrawal of some
deposits for investment in real estate or more
active business, and should help to increase the
value of landed property.
10. The community has not yet recovered from
the effects of the late crisis, and still suffers from
having to pay calls, the low price of stock, and
real estate being unsaleable, so that the general
position of the Colonies must have been very
sound to have stood the severe strain of the last
twelve months. We hope in the near future that
things will be much improved. Business is grad-
ually improving, and the new goldfields lately
discovered are finding employment for a great
many of our people.
The Report was adopted. F. Jago Smith, Esq.,
and R. J. King, Esq., were appointed Auditors
for the ensuing year, and a vote of thanks was
accorded to the Directors and Officers.

Report
Of the Directors presented to the Proprietors at the Half-yearly General Meeting held at the Banking House, Sydney, on Thursday, 26th July, 1894 at
The Directors have pleasure in submitting their Report for the Half-year ended 30th June last.
The Accounts have been examined and certified by the Auditors.

Napoleon Bonaparte I,
EMPEROR OP THE FRENCH.
THE SECRET OF HIS SUCCESS.
How he Preserved his Nervous System.
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, second son of
Charles Bonaparte and his wife, Letizia de
Rainolins, was born at Ajaccio, in Corsica, on the
15th of August, 1769. In the year 1779 h« entered
the Royal Military School of Brienne le Chateau.
There he remained till the autumn of 1784, when
he was transferred to the Military School of Paris,
according to the usual routine. He lost his father
in 1785, and the same year he was commissioned
a second lieutenant of artillery, and served as such
at Valence and other garrisons.
Napoleon attempted to obtain military power
in Corsica, but having failed, he fled to France,
where his career as a soldier and leader of men
became the most wonderful known to history, both
before and after that period. He was soon pro-
moted to chef de batallion, and commanded the
artillery at the siege of Toulon, where he highly
distinguished himself, and was the author of the
plan of attack which led to the fall of the place.
He was then promoted general of brigade.
On the fall of Robespierre, Napoleon was ordered
to take command of an infantry brigade in the
Army of the West. Thinking this beneath his
dignity, he refused to comply with the order, and
was discharged as a general. He was, however,
appointed second in command of the Army of the
Interior, Oct. 5, 1795, under Barras, and repelled
next day an attack of the sections of Paris.
Napoleon was appointed to the command of the
Army of Italy, Feb, 23, 1796; he married on
March 9, same year, Josephine Tascher de la
Pagorie, widow of General Yictome Alexandra
de Beauharnais, and left Paris immediately for
Italy. Napoleon’s great military genius flashed
forth in its full brilliancy in this his first
campaign. His power lay in the rapidity and
boldness of his decisions, and in the untiring
energy with which he carried them out, confound-
ing his enemies by the suddenness and lightning
rapidity of his blows, which never gave them time
to recover. He performed a very clever move, by
penetrating the point of junction of two strong
armies which were opposing the French army, the
one consisting of 20,000 Piedmontese under Colli,
the other of 38,000 Austrians, under Beaulieu, and
succeeded most wonderfully, although the French
army was only 36,000 strong.
From now his career was one continuation of
triumphal successes, until almost the whole of
Europe and other important parts of the world
was at his mercy. He soon became elected First
Consul for life, and in 1804 he assumed the title of
Emperor, and this was decreed by the Senate
shortly afterwards. The institutions which he
created, and which still remain, were the restored
church, the judicial system, the codes, the system
of Local Government, the University, the Bank
of France and the Legion of Honour. Space will
not permit to describe his unfortunate end, but
suffice it to say, that the wonderful nerve-power,
which he possessed and preserved to the last, was
absolutely due to a secret medical preparation
discovered in Corsica, by a medical relation of his,
and without which his nerves would have been
shattered long before he had reached his great
triumphs.
This great nerve invigorator is known as the
Napoleon Vigour Powder, and is now being intro-
duced into Australia, the sole Australian agents
being The Imperial Drug Company, 239 Eliza-
beth-street (near Bathurst-street), Sydney, who
will forward free pamphlets and all particulars on
application.
The Napoleon Vigor Powder is simply marvel-
lous for restoring a broken-down nervous system,
either brought on through early follies or other-
wise, and an excellent preventative against and
cure for nervousness, despondency, melancholia,
lost vitality and debility. The remedy is sold in
boxes at 6s., or in courses of 5 boxes at 25s. Double
course, 45s. posted. Pamphlets, remedies, &o.,
and all particulars sent strictly unobserved by the
agents, the Imperial Drug Co., 239 Elizabeth-street,
Sydney, to whom all cheques, Post Office money-
orders, postal notes, &c., should be made payable.
LOST VITALITY.
The NAPOLEON VIGOUR POWDERS are a
certain cure for all kinds of Nervousness, Debility and
Constitutional Weakness, Lost Vitality, Want of Vigour,
Loss of Memory and Appetite, and Want of Strength and
Development. Boxes, 65.; course of five boxes, 255.;

Bishop Smythe’s latest star, Parson Tal-
mage, from Amurrika, opened on Thursday at
Sydney Centenary Hall in the presence of a vast
and enthusiastic crowd, and with Smythe himself
perspiring profusely at the front door. About 7.45
a lady who had paid her admission-money fell down
dead on the premises, probably through excite-
ment at the prospect of seeing the great preacher,
and at 8 precisely a little, round, fat, oily shep-
herd trotted up to the rostrum on two brief
twinkling legs, and behind him stalked the gaunt,
black figure of the much-advertised parson, like a
headsman who had pawned his axe and meant to
execute the criminal with his feet. Talmage is
well-provided with feet. Also, he has a long,
spare, angular frame, and a hat and coat could be
hung upon the knobs of his spine. His face is
pallid, clean-shaven, and eager; his eye is
that of a man who sees threepence on
the horizon; and he has long arms which
look as if expressly built to reach out for
portable property. His style of elocution was
probably invented by himself and patented ; no
other man could elocute in the same fashion with-
out all his clothes flying asunder at the seams.
Its principal feature is its unexpectedness. The
preacher’s great drum-like voice rises with a cry
like the yell of a lost soul, just when there seems to
be no reason for it, and the effect vaguely suggests
that Talmage himself is doing the talking, and
that the yells are put in by an accomplice, who
always gets his oue at the wrong moment.
Generally the pastor ends an impressive sentence
on the very top of a howl, and then breaks off
short like a precipice, and there is a ravine of pro-
found silence before he starts again. If the occa-
sion is very impressive indeed, he throws up his
arms as he stops, and then he conveys a vague
idea that he is a runaway horse and has got in
front of himself to pull the animal up. Generally,
however, his whoops and his gesticulations and
his discourse all seem out of tune with each other,
and an idea arises that he has wound himself up
and set his long arms to fly out at a certain
moment, so that they have to fly out whether it is
the right moment or not.
• • •
Talmage’s accent is, as he would himself
describe it, something “tumble,” and his voice
suggests a corncrake in low circumstances. His
opening lecture dealt with “ The Bright Side of
Things,” and his philosophy is that this is the
best of all possible worlds, and the best of all pos-
sible epochs, and everything is right generally.
The sky is just blue enough, and the grass just
green enough, and the waters just clear enough,
and our legs are just long enough to reach the
floor, and therefore we ought to be content. He
is full of the glad optimism which goes with a big
salary, and a big bank-account, and a good dinner.
There was not, in all his lecture, one gleam of a
suggestion that the world contained such things as
cold, hunger, pain, or misery. His illustrations
all dealt with banks, and bankers, and people in
business, and affluence generally—except when now
and then he spoke unctuously in his hard voice
about beautiful girls, and then the little fat preacher
on the platform beside him threatened to go into
convulsions. In his own hard, unsympathetic
way, Talmage is humorous; his jokes are very,
very old, but he has the art of whirling his lank
arms as he utters them till somehow they sound
almost new. Also, in his own hoarse and shriek-
ful fashion, he is eloquent. Even in his humour,
however, his yearning for hell-fire can’t be alto-
gether restrained. “The Bright Side of Things ”
is illustrated by a garish, penny-dreadful account
of the burning of the Smithsonian Institute, in
which Talmage lets himself loose about the
devouring element and the “spirits of destruction
and calamity and w-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-O-OE,” in
a sudden yell and an abrupt stoppage which sug-
gests that he has fallen down and broken both his
knees. Then he winds up with an irrelevant bang
and roar about the end of the world —the black-
ness, the ashes, the combustion, the general burst-
ing-Up of all things and the falling of everything
in the bottomless black abyss of frost and forgot-
tenness —and retires. And The Bulletin’s im-
pression when he is gone is that Talmage is a hard,
keen, eloquent man of business, and absolutely the
best time-payment sewing-machine canvasser on
this earth. In fact, his preaching strongly sug-
gests that the Deity is a sewing-machine, and that
Talmage is pushing the sale of it for all be is
worth.
** * «
Bland Holt unfolded the last attraction of
his season, “A Woman’s Revenge,” by the late
Petti tt, at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday. There
is no horse-race in this production, and it travels
entirely on its own artistic merits. Its most re-
markable feature is the persistent insolvency of
the leading characters. Sass, as aggressively per-
pendicular as ever, finds in the second act that
all his money is gone through the machinations of
two villains, Cosgrove and Baker. Bland Holt
and his wife have an interview as to their financial
situation, and discover that they are both penni-
less. Miss Henrietta Watson, as a cruelly
maligned wife, is presently found living in a lone-
some cottage on a heath, where she hears that her
fortune has been embezzled and she is stone-broke
as well as lost. Information also arrives that the
good old father of the second villain has been
cleaned but—the first villain, apparently, has no
father. And then it transpires that the two
villains are themselves both utterly insolvent, and
they proceed to tear each other to pieces in the
hope of finding some assets on the remains. Some
other features are the awful persistency with which
Cosgrove and Miss Harrie Ireland pursue Mis s
Watson for seven disastrous years, while Sass is
away concocting schemes for bending himself ; the
ominous fashion in which Baker, the lowering
Mephistopheles of the play, looms up round un-
expected corners ; the artistic fashion in which a
hangman’s rope is nearly being fixed round
Henrietta’s neck; and various other things.
• # #
Further, there is something dreadful in
the hungry fashion in which Baker always hap-
pens to be looking through the window while
Cosgrove is up to some wickedness inside. Baker,
in fact, is the one thoroughly artistic character in
the drama. His biggest chance arrives in the last
act, where he becomes suddenly gaunt and yellow
and old, partly through insomnia and partly
through meeting the corpse of Cosgrove in his
mind’s eye at every corner. And when he appears
in the witness-box to fix the aforesaid rope round
Miss Watson’s unspeakably beautiful white
neck, and can’t keep his feet and hands
still, and has perpetually to lick his dry
lips nervously with his dry tongue, he is
a whole sermon on the text that the wicked
lawyer shall be found out and suspended. Misses
Watson and Ireland, Edward Sass, Bland Holt,
Cosgrove, and a very successful phild - actress
described as Smith, keep up the even tenor of the
rest of the show, and it is satisfactory to note that
most of the good characters recover their lost
money towards the end,
• • #
The author has missed one great sensa-
tion. When the heroine is acquitted, and two
large policemen arrest Baker in court, that person
ought to be found dead in his chair dead of heart-
disease, and terror, and the constant recurrence
of Cosgrove’s dead body in his mind’s eye—and
when the officers seize him he should simply
crumble on to the floor, and lie there staring with
sightless eyes at the roof. That would be an
artistic ending; the present one isn’t.

On Saturday next, Our Nellie, supported
by Wallace Brownlow, returns to Sydney and
makes an auspicious reappearance at the Lyceum
in “Paul Jones.” This circumstance is so vast
and so memorable that comment is unequal to the
occasion and language retires discomfited. There-
fore the bald announcement is left standing by
itself, as above. If any person thinks he can
make any remarks which are equal to such an
occasion he is requested to communicate with the
editor, enclosing .£1 as evidence of his bonafdes.

The blood-boltered nigger at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney) is doing his last lap on his way home to
the Better Land, and on Saturday he gives place
to the “Lion’s Heart an entirely new produc-
tion and alleged to be something tremendous.
m* * *
Miss Hilda Spong, of whom The Bulletin
prints an excellent portrait, is winding up her
season at Sydney Criterion with two nights of
Pinero’s “ Money Spinner,” by arrangement with
B. and 8., and a brief spell of “Dr. Bill,” by
arrangement with Miss Myra Kemble. Then the
fair Hilda departs by special arrangement with
herself, and Garner’s comedy co. comes along.
Making due allowance for all the disadvantages
under which she laboured, her season has been a
success, and if one person connected with the co.
had fallen down a stair at the very beginning of
the season and retired for prolonged repairs, it
would have been a much greater success than it
was.
** * *
With “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,” the
second B. and B. season at Melb. Princess’ made
a dashing start. A first-night audience’s recep-
tion of such a piece is not a certain index to
popular opinion, but the cheers that came after
curtain-fall on Saturday seemed to have the ring
of good money in them. Evidently the perform-
ance found many enthusiastic admirers, and they
may excite an interest in Pinero’s fine play among
people who, of late, refuse to go anywhere for
serious thought. The bulk of the Melb. populace
has a deplorable objection to being stirred by any
kind of revelation, however. “ Mrs. Tanqueray ”
recalls “The Profligate” to mind, for both plays
deal with the merciless vengeance of an immoral
past upon a repentant present, and indicate that
the author has an Ibsenic kink in his brain.
“The Profligate” was a false creation, a theatri-
cal sham, a sickly impostor, and Pinero practically
dedicated him to the Social Purity societies,
“ Mrs. Tanqueray,” on the other hand, is a real
victim of natural, though particular, circum-
stances. No part of the play strains probability
save the part where Mrs. Oortelyon talks offen-
sively to the second Mrs. T. of her intimacy with
the first Mrs. T., in the presence of the bride’s
husband and friends. That, surely, is a libel upon
sassiety manners.
• * «
Admitting the truth, force, and all-round
realism of the story, it is still difficult to under-
stand why Pinero should be credited with having
taught a great lesson in a specially bold and honest
way. The lesson he really does teach would have
no application to a “ gay ” woman who married a
bachelor, for instance. Exceptional circumstances
are created to fit a moral, whilst the fact that they
are exceptional is artistically concealed. Mrs.
Tanqueray’s trouble is a step-daughter. Without
this domestic encumbrance she would have got
along comfortably. When our old friend Arthur
Orton was fighting his impudent law-suit, two of
the titled contributors to his “Tichborne Fund”
w ere men who had married courtesans. One of these
wives from off the town bore children to her lord,
and died happy in their love. The other was the
second wife of an earl. Their marriage was a
success, the scorn of Mrs. Grundy mattered little
to them, and now the earl’s widow is devoting a
respectable old age to almsgiving and religious
pastimes. Her ooronetted Tanqueray had no
daughter to commit the extremely unlikely act of
betrothing herself to her stepmother’s former pro-
tector. These aristocratic precedents point straight
at the one weak spot in Pinero’s play, or, rather, in
its alleged lesson.
* * *
Mrs. Brough surprised everyone by her
performance of Paula, which has doubtless gained
much confidence and strength since she created it
(for Australia) in Sydney, three or four months
back. Sometimes she lost the character for a
moment, and allowed her old “goody-goody”
accent to assert itself in defiance of her naughty-
naughty character, but, taken for all in all, it was a
convincing performance and the actress held the
house. Titheradge and Miss Noble scored heavily
in the last act, and Cecil Ward’s inebriety, and
the veiled suggestiveness of his offer to stop and
keep Mrs. Tanqueray company, couldn’t well be
bettered. The cast, otherwise, was the same as in
Sydney, with one trifling exception, and the play
was elegantly staged, as a matter of course.
** * *
At the Alexandra they threaten to produce
a revised version of “ East Lynne,” with a land-
slip included, on Saturday night. The manage-
ment are cordially invited to call out little Willie,
and let the land slip into his shoes.
The revival of “George Barnwell” at
Melb. Royal seems to have been a Coppin inspira-
tion, rather than a Holloway idea. It was the
G.O.M-anager who seized snuffle by the forelock,
so to speak, and placed private boxes for Barnwell
at the Presbytery’s disposal. The wily Presbytery
refused to come forth and be crowned with shame.
Those boxes were bare, silent spots in a building
otherwise crowded to the roof on Saturday night.
George Barnwell, as many bishops and deacons
don’t know, was the typical Y.M.C.A. youth of
last century. He was beloved by his merchant-
master, and his master’s daughter, and the chief
clerk. They loaded him with precepts, and gave
him access to the cash. One day a tall, wicked
woman invited Barnwell to her house. He went
prepared to discuss Scripture with the mys-
terious lady, but she merely pinched bis leg and
made him stop to supper, and, worse than that,
“the author of hisruin” next persuaded Barnwell to
rob his worthy employer and assassinate his fond
uncle. Nunky is a transitory person in this tragic
history. He just comes on to enjoy his usual hour
of prayerful meditation in a wood, and Barnwell
cuts his soliloquy short. Somebody from the front
of the house would probably murder him if he
were allowed to meditate much longer. Then
Barnwell and Millwood (the wicked woman is
known only as Millwood) are captured and doomed
to die. Millwood prepares herself for Sheol in a
dungeon at the rear, whilst Barnwell repents, with
awful sincerity, in a front scene. The merchant
and his daughter and the pious clerk all come to
see their dear young friend off to execution, but
before he goes he implores the gallery to remember
George Barnwell, His last wish is to serve
as a shocking example, in which case he
feels that G.B. can hang happy. The Bulletin
erroneously stated that the curtain descended
upon a gallows tableaux. The noose and other
fatal accessories are left to the imagination. In
fact, a large portion of Barnwell’s career is left to
the imagination, but the bit on view is a riotously
solemn joke, and no parson can deny that it
preaches the true parsonic wor-rd. J. F. Oathoarb,
Miss Maud Williamson, and Julia Merton are
active in this Christian mission-work. Young
George Majeroni, although necessarily a diverting
hero, speaks his turgid lines with intelligence,
and promises to uphold the family reputation
anon.
• • •
Another aged drama, “A Dream at Sea,”
is bracketed with Barnwell. The dialogue con-
tains some cheerful wheezes that come out quite
fresh after a long retirement, and the broad
comedy passages (the play was written by the late
Buckstone, of spicy memory) are full of breadth.
The romantic plot is likewise a caution. Robert
Inman slumbers in a cave and dreams that Miss
Alice Deorwyn has been murdered. She was not
really murdered outright, although her friends
have buried her in the family vault. Inman, a
gallant ghoul, abstracts the alleged corpse and
plants it in the haunted cave, where he lights
charcoal and prepares to die beside his clammy
prize. The charcoal fumes somehow restore
Miss Alice to life, and Inman carries her out to
get fresh air just before the villagers arrest him
for the murder. He can’t confound them by pro-
ducing the corpse, because the maiden has walked
off in the meantime, bub she returns later, and a
certain Black Ralph, the Wrecker, confesses all.
“A Dream at Sea” is worthy of its place beside
“Barnwell.” The present writer hopes that the
same grand old double-bill may run for many
weeks, and shake his sides every evening till
further notice.

Loyal Heart.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Open wide my western window.
Let me hear the wild bush speak,
Let her soft breath cool the fever
That is burning brow and cheek ;
Surely, Jim, a grander sunset
Never lit the Tringa Creek !
I am riding, riding ever
To the realms of perfect rest;
I shall clash my golden stirrups
With the stirrups of the best—
Riding to a brighter sunset
Than is lighting all the west.
All my heart is lit with longing
For the golden days of yore.
And, though life was only toiling
At a master’s galley-oar,
I would gladly give me over
To the whip and chains once more.
I shall leave some friends behind me,
And, until their memory fails,
There are comrades who will miss me
When the sky to eastward pales,
And old Loyal Heart stands waiting
With his lean head on the rails.
How the great bush soothes my sorrow
With the wind-song that she sings—
Frank can have my old bush-saddle,
All the racing-gear and things,
Give young Jack the Swordfish filly,
Make him ride her with the “ rings.”
And Loyal Heart, old Loyal Heart—
O, generous friend and true !
By honest grip of sunbrowned hand,
I ask this boon of you—
To give him in the blue grass bends
The rest Jhat is his due.
But if the ringing cattle break
The mounted horsemen’s chain,
If the “brumby ” mob should best you
In the timber or the plain,
When your colts and fillies fail you
Saddle Loyal Heart again.
When the sand is over fetlock,
When the black mud lifts and clings,
When the younger steeds are tiring
And the raking rowel stings,
You’ll hold them safe on Loyal Heart
From the mulga to the wings.
And when the old horse pays the debt
That Nature asks of all,
You'll give him, like his master here,
No gorgeous funeral;
But let the red sun weep for him,
The shadows weave his pall.
Here, hold my hand, old comrade.
For the sun is sinking low ;
The vast wild bush is calling,
And I must mount and go
Beyond the flame-red ranges,
Beyond the sunset glow.

“Ib was said that a woman should not
vote because she could not fight, but a woman
risked her life for her country every time a soldier
was born.”— Maloney, M.L.A. {Vic.), in support
of his Woman’s Suffrage Bill.

Most of the draught “ eucalyptus oil” sold

Parkes, that man of loose eloquence and
hair, says that the cause of Constitutional Govern-
ment has again triumphed in N.S. W. Parkes has
got that phrase so much by heart that if he were
wrecked in mid-ocean, and spent three weeks on
a raft living on raw fish, and went mad and threw
all his clothes into the sea, and was at last picked
up, naked and encrusted with salt, and raving
wildly about his Stella, and had to be chained up
in a bunk and fed on beef-tea for a month, the
first thing he would say when he came to himself
would be that the great principle of Constitutional
Government had been once more vindicated. For
the fiftieth time or more The Bulletin rises to
ask Parkes, what, in the name of drivel, is the
blessed cause of Constitutional Government?

Salmon, a new Vic. M.P. : “If women
should have a voice in the laws they have to obey,
then because the brute creatures are governed
they, too, should have a vote.” (! !) Frank
Madden, the latest, and perhaps most blatant and
hide-bound back-number Tory in the House, said
that if the wife of the man on strike had a vote,
and attempted to exercise it in opposition to the
will of her husband, he would promptly “ black
her eye.” Madden is evidently in favour of giving
a vote to the wife of Fatman, because his serene
adiposity never “smacks his missus in the eye.”
The Vic. electors should be proud of the man who
holds that his wife shouldn’t have a vote merely
because his horse and his dog, his ox and his ass
don’t go to the poll.
The latest information from Paraguay is

Business Announcements.
The Caligraph Writing Machine. j
&
mHE CaLIGRAPH embodies all the highest
I developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that tlrs platen of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, you
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their type
out of perpendicular. Then remember that tin
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
The Caligraph manifolds 16 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

“ Tho wife before marriage is Pompeii
before the eruption 1 and the wife after marriage
f 9 Pompeii after the eruption.* -Maiub Bash-
KIIITBEFir.
An Italian steamer collided the other day
witli a Russian ironclad in the Black Sea, and the
ironclad straightway went down to a peaceful
bed among the ooze and the shme. This is the sort
of thing which the ironclad almost invariably
does on the smallest provocation; a collision
breaks up the average monitor like so much glass.
The loyal Australian politician who feels himself
becoming inflated over the miserable Naval Tri-
bute Squadron should make a note of this, and pub
the memo, somewhere where he will fall over it
every day.
There died recently in the Ararat (Vic.)
Lunatic Asylum a patient who outrivalled Ber-
trand in the length of his confinement. In the
early fifties Dr. Alfred Yates Carr was practising
medicine at Ballarat, and assisted in attendance
unon the wounded at the Eureka Stockade fight,
Dec ’54- In he became an inmate of the
Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum, from which he
escaped several times. He was chief witness for
defendants in the libel case, Bowie, superintendent
of the Asylum, v. the Argus, and under cross-
examination proved quite a match for “Dick”
Ireland, then at the height of his power. So
astonished was Ireland that at the end of the trial,
which finished practically for the paper, Bowie
getting £lOO on a minor count, that counsel
declared to his friends that he believed in the
doctor’s sanity.
Wardlaw, eminenb London barrister, was
great on poisoning-defences. When Mrs. Fres-
singwold was introduced to him by her friends,
under the charge of thus doing her husband to
death, he thought, “ This little blonde is the per-
fect Lucrezia Borgia and Brinvilliers. Let’s see
how she will lie.” But she didn’t. _ All she
wanted was to die. She had been deceived by a
villain, who bolted. Wardlaw got her off with
the finest speech on record. He married her.
The tension became severe, in a thousand imagin
able ways. They loved each other, but the rift
curie, entirely without her fault. He fenced her
round all he could. She had to discharge a ser-
vant, who said then, tartly, “Do you think I’m
going to stop here to be poisoned?” A worse
shock was the occurrence of a criminal trial, pre-
cisely similar to her own. Of course, Wardlaw,
the great expert, could not be in it. His mind
got out of hinge. He went morbidising, till he
fancied he was being slowly poisoned. At the
dinner-table, he shook up his coffee, in the saucer,
and said, “ I believe this is what you used for
him.” She burst into tears. He quite lost
control, and brutally asked her lover’s name—a
matter they had never referred to. She got up
and walked out of the room, straight to her bed-
chamber. In the morning she was found dead.
One arm hung out of bed, and the forefinger
seemed to point to a little bottle. __

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Owing principally to the refusal of the Nor-
woods to accompany the S.A. football team to Victoria,
the match turned out a miserable farce, the Melbournians
kicking 13 goals to 0 without exerting themselves.
• * * *
The record mile walk of Corporal Clarke, of
S. A. Militia, which lowered the best previous time (6 min,
23 sec.) by 36 4-sth sec., was performed under adverse
weather conditions. Clarke stands somewhere about 6ft.
Bin., and claims to have a five-foot stride. Allegedly
competent judges assert that Clarke runs, but the writer,
who was there and is practically acquainted with the sub-
ject, having walked the mile in 30 min. 59 sec., is quite
satisfied as to Clarke’s bona fldes.
.** ♦ •
Sporting pressmen are considered to have a
claim on the handicapper’s billet. Perhaps this explains
why we hear so much about the necessity of appointing
an assistant to A.J.O. 0.0. M. Scarr.
* * * *
The Bulletin’s prediction that a galloway
would some day be returned as winner of Melb. Cup is
more likely than ever to be fulfilled. The Associated
Pony Clubs have decided to raise the standard from 14
hands Sin. to 15 hands. Many Sydney trainers could with
time get Pans to pass under that. In England the
standard is 15 hands.
♦ * * *
For Caulfield Grand National Hurdle Race next
month, Navarino, lOst. 81b., is reported to be “not too
bad.”
* • * *
Startling rumours of bribery in re the defeat of
the Vic. Totalisator Bill. A leading bookmaker asserts,
from personal knowledge, that £7OO was got rid of by the
Hebrew bookies. It is certainly curious that many mem-
bers who opposed the Bill before, and who were known to
be about the House, did not vote.
♦ ♦ ♦ *
Capstan, a very powerfully-built son of Sheet
Anchor, may win the Caulfield or Melbourne Cup—
perhaps both. A real good horse to look at, and fast
enough to run fourth in last Newmarket Handicap.
The brother of one of Melb.’s leading bookies
nas just sent in his checks, leaving nearly five figures
behind him. Some distant poverty-stricken relatives
pome in for nearly the whole, to the consternation of
immediate connections.
* * • •
Brewer was to have ridden Daimio in the G.N.
iteeple, but was asked to stand down at the last moment,
owing, it is said, to his having had a “ go ” on the track
on his own hook, contrary to orders.
• • * •
Bloomer, the N.S.W. dog which won the last
Waterloo Cup, killed five out of six hares in the
trials. Both the Benalla and Moonee Valley piumptons
have hares which have been christened “Carbine.” The
Moonee Valley Carbine has for five or six seasons beaten
the dogs in the matter of speed, and is still alive. He is
generally reserved for the final course. It was said that
Bloomer killed the Benalla Carbine when on her way
over, but the secretary says this is incorrect, and he offers
to lay 10 to 1 that the hare, which, by the way, has been
unsexed, will beat any two dogs in Australia.
* * • *
A somewhat boozy Victorian caused a lot of fun
f mongst the knowing ones the other Saturday and Mon-
day, by asking every bookie he met “ Where did Giblets
run in the Canterbury Handicap ?” A wag had sent him
a wire on Saturday from Brisbane, signed “Adams,”
informing him that his ticket had drawn Giblets for the
race named.
• ♦ * •
Extraordinary odds were landed by the “working
miner ” at Korrumburra who won* the pigeon-shooting
match the other day. His left arm was in a sling, and
his friends loudly proclaimed that shooting would do the
patient harm. When the commission had been worked,
the miner unslung his arm and potted his birds without a
miss. The local books, after being skinned to a man,
were informed that the winner had seen better times, and
would then have been backed for thousands, but could
find no one to take him on.
* * * •
Thestarting-maohine was a success at the Cante-
rbury Park (N.S.W.) races on Saturday last. It has come
to stay. Lady Ida started a warm favourite for the
Hurdle Race, Underwood having crossed the border
specially for the mount; hut it did not come off, as
Highborn 11., who ran so well at Warwick Farm, beat her
by a length.
The Chester colt, Duke of York, won the Flying
Handicap, and one of Sam Hordern’s importations—a
three-year-old named Isolena, by Doubloon, My Lena-
won the Park Stakes.
The Canterbury Handicap fell to E.K., who
heat Whist by a couple of lengths. Whist started un-
backed, and with 71b. over-weight, so his running must
have proved rather a surprise to his party.
• • * *
An immense crowd filled Sydney Cricket
Ground on the occasion of the return Rugby match,
N.S.W. v. Queensland. The play was not as keen as
might have been expected from the previous Saturday’s
match, as N.S.W. fairly ran over the Bananalanders.
White was again the hero of the day ; but Warbrick did
not play with his usual brilliancy for Queensland, no
doubt from the fact of an injured shoulder, and the
respect with which he treated White, who had handled
him so roughly the previous Saturday.
* » * *
Torpedo, the horse in which pugilist Tom Leea
held an interest, and which was rather a sensational animal
in Sydney some time back, won the July Handicap in
Adelaide on Saturday. At same meeting, Port Admiral
got the father of a dressing from Lord Granville in Tatter-
sail’s Handicap.
* * * *
At Oaklands (Vio.) Hunt Club Meeting, Dr.
Cortis’ Jacob, with the reasonable weight of 9st. 131bs.
and-Mr. H. Cortis in the saddle, won the miie-and-half
Open Hurdle race.

On SCROFULOSIS.—YoI. XVI.
“What form of artificial feeding ought to be
selected ? The results of our own experience may

It is lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations,and considerably enhances its
value.

A Divorce Court Wrinkle.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The wife had long been engaged in a
secret amour. Occasion had frequently been
safely kind. But there came one disastrous even-
ing when the husband, returning home unex-
pectedly, “learned all.” After the inevitable
storm, he promptly interviewed a lawyer, in order
to institute proceedings for divorce.
“Have you a photograph of your wife?’’en-
quired the man of law.
“Yes.”
“ Bring it to me.”
The husband complied with what seemed to him
a strange and irrelevant request.
“ H’m ! You’ll never succeed against so pretty
a woman as she is. Now, take my advice. Go
and see your wife, or bring her to me, and fix up
an agreement that she shall apply for a divorce
against you.”
“Against me ? But she can’t; I’ve not erred
against her in the least matter.”
“ Never mind. We’ll manufacture the grounds
—desertion and cruelty, adultery, anything.”
“ But I don’t follow the scheme.”
“Be guided by me. If you prosecute her, you’ll
fail, as you have no witnesses. She will probably
apply for a separation and alimony. If she
prosecutes you, we will have an agreement pre-
arranged that, if you don’t defend the case, she
will not apply for alimony. Then you will be quit
of her, and that’s your object, I suppose?”
“Yes.”
And it was so settled.

A charming lady, soberly but tastefully
costumed, tells her terrible domestic troubles in
Court. An emotional Judge keeps sopping his
handkerchief to his eyes, as he jots down his
notes on the case, and cries occasionally ; “Stop a
minute, please, madame,” because his feelings
clog his caligraphy, and he must needs pause to
shove up his spectacles and mop away his tears.
There is no appearance of the respondent, and
the name of the co-respondent is unknown.
His Honor : “ I see how it is, my poor woman.
You have been most brutally and shamefully
treated by your husband. The circumstances
related by you, together with your demeanour in
Court, clearly reveal to my experienced and
trained judgment that your own conduct has been
irreproachable. How is it that the most angelic
women generally choose as husbands the most de-
praved men? I grant a rule nisi, returnable in
three months.”
And all parties are satisfied.
* * •
The above is a fact, and fresher than some
“new-laid ” eggs. Further, a barrister informed
me that in no less than five divorce cases in which
he was engaged during one week, a similar plan of
action was followed—with “ satisfactory ” results,
and no application for alimony. __
THE DIPSOMANIAC.
A new S.A. industry is the mouse-liar.
From S.A. Register:—
A farmer near Muloowurtie has to fight the mice from
his plate while having his meals. At Petersville a cat was
put into a room where the chaff was raised from the floor
and protected by tins. On opening the door the farmer
found millions of mice on the ground and the cat with its
tail erect, evidently frightened out of its wits. Directly
a light was shown the mice scampered off, and the oat
disappeared and has never been heard of since.
Sausages in some S.A. country districts are now
only Id. per lb.
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by
Sharp’s new “Cannalin” treatment, large quan-
tities of which are being forwarded to sufferers
throughout the colonies. It is obtainable, with
advice, from 257 George-street, Sydney.
William Bates, of South Melbourne, took
a pair of boots from a shop, the other day, and
straightway departed with his plunder in quest of
a policeman. Having accomplished the act of
larceny his next move was to get himself arrested
and committed to prison for as long as possible.
As an honest man Bates had proved a failure; he
could 'get no work, the pangs of hunger were
troubling him inside, and this bold stroke of policy
was his last resource.
In 1782 that gifted fossil, poet Oowpen
wrote: —
The Frenchman, easy, debonair, and brisk,
Give him his lass, his fiddle, and his frisk,
Is always happy, reign whoever may,
And laughs the sense of misery far away:
He drinks his simple beverage with a gust,
And, feeding on an onion and a crust,
We never feel the alacrity and joy
With which he shouts and carols, Yive le Roy t
Filled with as much true merriment and glee
As if he heard his king say—“ Slave be free 1”
A few years later the debonair Frenchman carolled
the “ Marseillaise ” and guillotined his Roy.
Don’t be rough on William Bates,
Don’t be hard on Billy ;
Safe within the prison gates
One is sure of “skilly.”
Lock him up and keep him good.
Guard him from his neighbour;
All he asks is simple food
For any kind of labour.
Let him do “ a bit of time ”
Decent-like and proper,
Sans the option of a crime
Pleaded to a “ copper.”
Not for money William sought
Boots that wasn’t his’n ;
Theft was but his happy though*
For getting into prison.
Felons’ fare is not a feast
Tempting to the wealthy;
Bates would say that, at the leasts
Hominy is healthy.
Bid him linger on awhile
Grateful for his ration ;
Bliss for Bill is durance vile—
Freedom spells Starvation.

Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita
tion of tiie Bladder a.nd Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.

most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting dDes-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.

instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.

"A Yellow Aster.”
A new novel may be judged in two aspects— as a
work of genius, or as a work of talent. You may
pit it against the great fictional creations, niched j
in history, consecrated by tradition, supreme as
art; or you may compare it with current books to
amuse, and gauge success by its vogue, its in-
terest, and its fitness to the mood of the moment.
In the one view “ A Yellow Aster ” has no stand-
ing ;in the other, it is a book of high merit. It
is undeniably clever, though the cleverness is only
superficial; it has power, but no reserve power.
You feel that the authors have done the best of
which they are capable, and recognise that the re-
sult is enjoyable without being admirable. Com-
pared with “The Heavenly Twins ’’and its satellites
the superiority of “A Yellow Aster’’ is easily
apparent. It is not morbid, it is not melancholy ;
it is coherent and complete. Special interest for
Australian readers lies in the fact that Dr. and
Mrs. Caffyn were formerly residents of Mel-
bourne ; for Bulletin readers, in the fact that
Dr. Caffyn frequently contributed to these
columns. Though the whole credit of authorship
is yielded to the lady, it is presumed that her
husband must take praise for a good deal of the
plan, and for most of the method and
arrangement, as well as for the added strength
given by those touches with which it is com-
paratively easy for a revising collaborator to im-
prove and illustrate the thought of his partner.
This revision has been ably done, with the result
of leaving nothing that is weak, and little that is
unnecessary, so that the book gains steadily in
interest to the climax.
# * •
Given the plot, everything goes of itself. A
queer, intellectual, out-of-the-world father and
mother “produce” two children—one a boy, an
excrescence on the story; the other a girl, its
heroine. The parents come out of their studies —
brown, well-furnished, and various—to direct
that their offspring shall be taught everything
but religion. This, however, is only a side-issue,
and its influence on the main theme is inartisti-
cally suppressed later on. But the students have
also no time to love their children, and the central
picture is that of the girl, thrown back on herself,
with her affections stifled, growing up to dormant,
sexless womanhood. She marries as an experi-
ment ; and the rest is a description of her heart-
awakening—first through her mother's death,
afterwards by the birth and sickness of her child.
Then her husband, who has had a rough time of
it, is repaid for his rash adventure.
# * •
The book is mainly dialogue, and the dialogue,
is mainly entertaining. Gwen (the heroine) thinks
the force ruling the world is quite human in its
temper and its injustice.
“Rather capricious and old-womanish, too —1 often
think that.”
“Why?”
“Why! From the stupid times and places that earth-
quakes and waterspouts and things come ; they hardly
ever burst up or beat down desert islands or places like
that; they always flock to populated places where people
have been working for years to make themselves comfort-
able, and then all in a minute their work is undone, and
they may think themselves lucky if they aren’t undone
themselves. That sort of thing seems reasonless and like
an old man.”
The heartless Gwen wishes she could flirt like
other girls ;
It looks such a delightful pastime 1 I have seen plain
girls look positively quite beautiful when engaged in it.
The undercurrent of heaps of girls’ lives, upon which it
seems to me all the rest is built up, is a sort of simmer-
ing, unconfessed, vague longing for the sensation of being
“ caught and kissed,” like the little brown maid in the
old rhyme ; not in a general vulgar way, but in a well-
bred particular way. It is a quite incomprehensible
sensation to me.
That is wicked ; but this is worse ;
Even virtue in women is very much a matter of tem-
perament, and where the temperament is, there will the
opportunities be gathered together.
Not very original, maybe; and, indeed, striking
originality of thought is not the authors’ strong
point. But their book is a very pleasant and
satisfactory evening’s reading.

A Study of Revenge.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
, , . . , , ,
To say that at one time he was my dearest
friend is superfluous—for how otherwise could I
have conceived for him such an intense hatred;
how nourished such a consuming desire for
revenge ? ... , . . .
evenge was, indeed, my sole remaining passion,
At the very sight of him it burned with
dangerous violence; when the blood, boiling and
singing through my veins, threatened, no longer
abiding its accustomed course, to burst forth from
the facial orifices in scarlet suffusion.
Restrain yourself I—l reasoned; lest the very
excess of your passion defeat its gratification.
More especially did the fear of doing him a
violence cause me to exercise over myself a rigid
control. I or such was not the measure of my
vengeance. .
Should I in one furious moment put him for
ever beyond my reach ?_ Could a single draught of
his hot and fresh-flowing blood quench my im-
mortal hate ? If I had been guilty of such weak-
ness, which, for the fleeting ecstasy of a moment,
sacrificed the happiness of eternity, I would have
incontinently, with suicidal hand, reft my soul
from its vesture, to seek his—aye. it might be
beyond the very depths of perdition.
Time, which effaces all things, has not less-
ened the injury he did me ; for memory, with
its indelible pencil ever deepening the same lines,
still, as my soul lives, presents to me the eternal
picture of ray wrong. .

not allow myself to be bound by the limits
of the conception or execution of any act of
vengeance since the world began I scorn such
a puny confine. ly revenge ra ■
any which had till then been conceived by mere
man. Years had intervened. During the whole
time I had worked with unceasing energy in
the furtherance of the object of my life.
I bewildered the brilliancy of his intuition,
which told him that “ never can true reconcile-
ment grow where wounds of deadly hate have
pierced so deep and we were the closest of close
friends. I endured from him petulance and insults
interminable. I rejoiced in them.
There were moments when I revelled, in
imagination, in the deep and exceeding happiness
which the future promised—a moment of bliss
prolonged to an eternity.
For some considerable time there had been en-
gendered within my friend—as he thought, of his
own choice; but, in reality, of my initiative—a
craving for metaphysical and psychological know-
ledge.
To this he entirely abandoned himself with a
steady determination and a feverish haste, as
though some great thing depended on the result of
his research. Nor would he be satisfied, until
he should stand on some remote and perilous
verge and peer into the unknowable.
Possessing, in a high degree, the divine
gift of imagination, he was also eminently
endowed with the mathematical and analytical
faculties—a rare combination. The exact sciences
were to him as the alphabet; and his conclusions
were invariably rapid and certain : it was only by
positive effort that he could form a false one.
The just solution to him was always the line of
thought of least resistance. His delicately-
balanced mind instantaneously separated the false
from the true.
By a taoit understanding between us, on these
subjects alone were our lengthy conversations and
arguments. He eagerly sought for, and as quickly
exhausted, the most erudite works on his favourite
studies. In all matters I appeared to him per-
fectly frank, except only as to certain philosophic
theories, wherein I seemed to exercise a sort of
reserve. I demonstrated the probability, showed
the absurdity, proved the possibility—but here
stopped. He plainly believed I had proceeded a
step beyond him in the achievement of for-
bidden knowledge. I held an ascendancy abso-
lute> bub pure i y men tal. At length the oppor-
tunity and the time converged to the accompiish-
menb G f my purpose.
W e were encamped at an immense distance
from human habitation, ostensibly for sporting
purposes. By an apparent mischance our books
b ad been left behind. The tent was pitched, at
the end and the bottom of an enormous rift in the
earth. This opening was in form and appearance
as though a gigantic thunderbolt had rent a moun-
tain. On three sides we were surrounded by its
towering and almost perpendicular walls, and on
the fourth was spread before us the desolation of
the plain. Its barren and blasted ground was
strewn with innumerable boulders of a glaring
white colour—the traces of some mighty and long-
passed glacier. The spot had been chosen in our
wanderings because of its almost weird beauty,
but it was a beauty that oppressed without
charming. A likeness to the abode of the dead
was too apparent in its tomb-like stones, some of
which, by chance poised on end, seemed to denote
a fresh interment.
For some days my friend had been in
strange unrest. His was a step that incessantly
refcur » ed to the e ncampraent-an eye that ever
tioni 80ught panting and fierce
% fcQ | now s what and w hy, I concealed. So
gtronß was this desire that it emanated from him
like some hypnotic influence to wrest my secret
f me-but stronger far was my resistance,
_„. * * ,
. On that evening the sun was setting strangely—
* was already declined beyond our vision, bub a
small blot of deep red colour covered its parting
and as the world turned over this gradually
increased in size and changed to a darker and
more purple hue, till it seemed a foul blotch ot
clotting blood on the otherwise stainless sky.
We we , re seat ed outside the tent, and be-
tween us burnt the camp-fire,
The bush sleeps during the day, beneath the
narcotic rays of the sun, but as night draws on
it wakes with its many voices. This night it
awoke, but remained in fearful and trembling
silence—only now and again was heard a slight
rustle or movement, as something living sought
a more obscure retreat. Perhaps this stillness was
because of the oppressive and stifling weight of
the air; or it might be the inhabitants of the
bush feared that dark, livid, and ever-increasing
mass which extended on the horizon and piled it-
self towards the zenith.
We had sab in silence for an hour. Not that
this alone was unusual; for in the Australian bush
solitude and silence beget a love of their like; bub
this silence was strange because of the pallor of his
face and the quaking of his frame, whilst the
quick and heavy thumping of my heart told of
an ecstatic excitement close at hand,
At length he raised his head, and with an
appealing look, called me by name.
“ Listen 1 ” I abruptly articulated, in a voice as
unlike my own as the words which now broke
from my parching lips.
As I continued, he gradually sunk forward on
his knees, and approached himself towards me,
inclining his head slightly, so as not to_ lose a
single syllable of my utterance. I hurried that
which I had to say, for I feared the interruption
of the storm within me, not less than of the now
fast approaching and terrific tempest, whose shriek-
ing and howling were heard in the distance.
He had crawled forward on the burning embers,
the light from which, flickering dimly, fell across
his face, whereon was mirrored the effect of my
words. His attitude was that of a child who fears
punishment. One hand was raised as though to
ward off a blow, whilst the other rested on the
still glowing remnants of the fire. A tiny spiral
of smoke arose from the scorching flesh.
As I spoke the last words, his face began to
assume the expression for which I had waited.
The black sky split, and a flood of dazzling blue
light surrounded us. At the same moment he
sprang upward.
“ I am then ” he exclaimed.
“Mad!” I shouted furiously, while the blood
sprang from my mouth as though to attest my
words. “ Mad !—and for ever ! ”
In another moment, I was in the saddle of my
waiting horse and had lashed it to a gallop.
As with maddened bounds the terrified animal
fled up the narrow path which skirted the very
edge of the ravine, I fancied I could distinguish
amongst the confusion of sounds one—not of the
elements.
I leaned out of the saddle, till the whole upper
portion of my body hung sheer over the yawning
precipice.
Then rose into my ears, from the foot of the
rooky wall, hundreds of feet below, despite the
roar and havoc of the terrible storm, which now
raged in its fullest fury—a prolonged and mourn-
ful cry. It was the voice of a soul from which
Hope had for ever fled.
An ineffable serenity pervaded my whole being.

A. LEGEND OF LOMBOK.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Upon a black sand beach, a cinnamon-
coloured man, with blue loin-cloth, yellow jacket,
scarlet head-kerchief. Conspicuous, surely; yet
of this polychromatic arrangement Morgan saw
nothing until it planted itself within two feet of
his nose.
The sand was black because it was volcanic;
the man was cinnamon because he was a Sassak;
and Morgan was preoccupied because he was in
an uncommonly “tight place.” Figuratively,
that is; for, literally, he was in a notoriously
loose place —Ampanat, in the island of Lombok.
Loose, at least, as regards the “dominant class” —
Brahminical and alien; though morally tight
enough with the Sassaks —Mahommedan and
aboriginal. But the Sassak, no more than any-
body else, considers himself bound to undertake
the morality of other people, nor did this parti-
coloured person’s profession differ very violently
from that upon which “Sir Pandarus of Troy ”
has conferred the lustre of his name. With grace-
ful salutations of the Orient, he professed, in
deferential accents and the Malay tongue, his
consuming eagerness to help the “ exalted white
master ” out of his present difficulty.
Morgan stopped booting the beach and laid a
sudden hand upon the yellow cotton jacket. “ My
difficulty? What is my difficulty ? If you don’t
happen to know what you’re talking about, my
leather-coloured friend, I’ll teach you to come
messing about Billy Morgan when he’s down-by-
the-head.”
Ju Somal understood only that he was being
threatened. He brought his kris-handle into
view, smiled an indulgent smile, and waited till
Morgan had repeated himself— minus the mination
—in Malay.
The Sassak stretched a lanky arm towards
where, beyond the snowy surf-ridges, the purple
of the Indian Ocean vanished into the dazzle
struck up from the inner anchorage by the in-
tolerable sun. “ There was your ship this morn-
ing. She is gone !—and you are here ! No friends !
No money ! Say I good ?”
In ten thousand sailor-men there may be one
who doesn’t swear. Morgan was that one, but he
was sorely tempted. “ Good ?” he muttered. “ It’s
bad ! —d-deplorably bad ! Can’t say the old man
didn’t warn me; but I never thought he’d have
done it!”
Now, the “old man”—which is to say Sandy
Graham, master-mariner and part owner of the
barque Jerusalem —hadn’t “done it,” after all.
Instead of being on his way to Amoy with his
cargo of trepang and sandalwood, the wily Sandy
had only stood away for Bali Strait, and was
waiting, in a manner, “ round the corner ” until
the lesson should have well bitten into his truant
second-mate.
“ We’ll slip roon’ again, the nicht,” he said to
his “first,” as he stumped up and down his little
slice of poop. “ He’ll scarce believe his een whan
he sees the auld craift at her ainchor again in the
mornin’! A’m theenkin’ we’ll cure the laddie,
this turn, o’ dilly-dallyin’ ashore wi’ the lasses
whan the vassel’s hove-short! ”
• # *
Ju Somal explained. Simi-Lik had sent
him.
“ The Chinky girl! ” thought Morgan. “ Pooh
—what can she do ? ” Which was scarcely fair to
the canary-coloured damsel whose mercantile
parent had so hospitably entreated him, and who
was the more sorry for his predicament in that
she considered her own fascinations as partly the
cause thereof. The sailor, at all events, had hardly
got out of Pah-Pak-Wak’s house before that
eminent citizen entered it with the news that the
Jerusalem had sailed. Simi-Lik, in tribulation,
had sought her Sassak handmaiden, who had
sought Ju Somal, who had sought—and found —
the disconsolate Mr. William Morgan.
“A thankless kind of a beast!” was what the
sailor called himself when, by Ju Somal, all this
had been duly recounted. “ Real good-hearted
little girl, it must be; even if it is a bit greenery-
yallery ! Off you go, spindle-shanks, and say I’ll
come !”
“ Spindle-shanks ” understood, and was off, top-
speed, to claim his promised dollar. But, as he
ran, he ruminated. A dollar ? Why, there were
two or three dollars in it! Bah ! Jankan was
rich ! He would surely give five dollars to be told
of this thing! And to Jankan’s house the brown
shanks flew.
# • »
Morgan sat under the mangoes and won-
dered. This was what he had sneered at as the
“Chinky girl”—this laughing, lovely, splendid-
eyed creature, with a flowery wonder in its glossy
hair, and silken miracles about its graceful shape.
In Malay—the lingua franca of the Archipelago—
she chattered gaily to the white man. Her father
was very rich, and very fond of her. He would
do anything to please her. Also, he was fond of
white men—and so was she ! And slyly she
watched Morgan over her gold-and-ebony fan.
He warmed to the idea. There was money in
it—lots of money! And the girl was fit for an
emperor ! But then—a Chinky wife ! Frightened
by a word, he froze, and coarsely told a woman,
who—race for race—was vastly better bred than
himself, that he “wasn’t on.” The words were
Malay, but their value was about the same, and
the “woman scorned,” looking him steadily in
the eyes, mentally sentenced him to death!
» • •
Pah-Pak-Wak, known to the few Britishers
in Lombok as “ Papa Quack,” was of a personality
inconceivable by those who have seen only the
“ scrubber ” Chinaman of Australia and the
States. Six feet and 16 stone, with strong, saga-
cious countenance and snowy cone of beard —gold-
rimmed glasses sat on his respected nose, a gold-
linked white silk blouse enveloped his portentous
stomach, blue cashmere trousers cased his sub-
stantial legs, and a red silk tuft completed his un-
speakable pigtail.
To him quoth Jankan, “ Have a care. I can do
much with the Raja! He will not see me
wronged.”
Pah-pak put down his chopsticks and smiled—
the immemorial Celestial smile. He —which is to
say, his dollars —could do more with Lombok’s
ferocious ruler than any other man in the island.
But, despising—brains and body—this skinny little
Indo-Malay, the man of business wasn’t going to
argue the question.
“It is of my daughter we speak, not of the
Raja. It is but common kindness Simi-Lik has
showed this English stranger. But, in any case,
she shall please herself. We make not slaves of
our women, like .”
“Like the men of Lombok 1” Jankan swelled
his five-feet-nothing to another inch or so, came a
step nearer, and slowly drew forth his kris.
“ Seest thou this ?” he said.
Pah-Pak coolly reached out for the weapon,
examined the gold inlaid hilt, passed his finger
oyer the ridgy steel of the blade, and handed it in-
differently back. “ Pretty fair !” he said, and took
up his chopsticks again. “But I don’t want to
buy-”
Jankan turned green—Malays do turn green—
at the insulting assumption that he wanted to sell,
and his hand trembled till the kris clattered
against its wooden scabbard as he sheathed it.
“ Dog !’’ was all his colourless lips could utter.
Pah :. l>ak ~ h ? was eating dragon-flies fU’AMi?e—
carefully fished out one of them, balanced it over
the dish upon a chopstick, and looked significantly
nn.iil-fT at, gre M y gr T msect and th ® \ en T'
ous little Malay. No words were wanted for his
meaning : he dreaded the one about as much as
th Bnh h !f‘ft. he in, . „ ~ .
But, at the bottom of the monster-flanked steps
Jankan’s wrath was changed to jubilation. A
moon-faced yellow urchin, dodging through the
orange-trees of the court-yard, thrust upon him a
fomave d pih S p!l a f« v Vi an,shed -- p Jankan, reading,
forgave Pah-Pak, for here was Pah-Pak’s daughter
herself delivering over the white man to destruo-
tlon 9 #

A belated sumpit-api, dropping from the
roof upon the slumbering Morgan’s face, promptly
expressed its feelings with its latter end. The
sailor’s sleep was a sailor’s, but since, if anything
could wake the dead, it would probably be the
fire-ant s ’ sting, Morgan was on his feet in an
instant—and not an instant too soon. Straight at
him, from the window, came a noiseless figure—a
shadow in the dim lamp-light—but a shadow with
a kris! A Chinese house is never short of
weapons-jars and vases without end—and from a
little bamboo table Morgan swung up a stately
piece of porcelain that knocked the stranger one
way and his kris another. There were smothered
voices outside; Morgan snatched up the kris and
rushed into the verandah. A glimmer of dawn
showed him a dozen men in the garden. “ Too
hot!” he said, and bounded across the flower-beds
towards the little door, standing open in the high,
mud wall. But a woman, close beside it, thrust
it sharply to, and was fumbling with the fasten-
ing when Morgan dragged her backwards by the
hair—Simi Lik’s hair !—flung her against the legs
of the pursuing Jankan, tore the door open, and
was off—running light in shirt and trousers.
After him, through the narrow mud-walled
streets, he could hear the shuffle of the naked
feet; no shouts—for the Malay can’t run with a
white man, and they wanted all their breath,
Instinctively, Morgan headed for the beach, till
unexpectedly he ran out of a winding lane
into sight of the long rollers gleaming to
the rapid equatorial sunrise. The hunted
man glanced at the crimson segment peering
over the sullen sea-line of the east—then at the
otnln^n P t“h7br k St i minS “* *
That Yankee s not more than half-a-mile out.”
He threw away the kris and dashed into the
surf, catching faintly the disappointed yell of the
human pack as he dived under the first advancing
wall of water.

“ Thunder ! ” and the skipper skipped. “ I

No—hold on! There's a boat headin’ for him
already from that barque roundin’ Gatchee Point,

“Jerusalem, cap., exactly! that’s her name,

“ Weel, Morgan, ma lad!” said the
“ cranky old galoot,”as his recovered second officer

Morgan pointed overboard to a couple of black
triangles cutting this way and that upon the
surface, "
“ No,” he said, “but they have!”

Dear Bulletin,—“ Ung’a” maximum loads
for elephant, camel, and horse are for extended
marches. In the case I referred to, a nob very big
bull Baotrian was backed to get up with 1800
on him, travel 1800 yards, and lie down for un-
loading—all which he did without any apparent
distress. And the reason why-though a camel
can’t draw more than a powerful Clydesdale—he
can carry four times as much, is simply that his
spine, unlike the horse’s, curves slightly upwards
—making thus an enormous statical difference.
The Clydesdale’s legs would stand the camel’s
load—his back wouldn’t, because he “isn’t built
that way ! ”—Dromedary.

London SPORTING Times, discussing the
bullet-proof coats, remembers that some years ago
a material not more than a quarter of an inch
thick was sent from Australia and declared to be
bullet-proof. The Times is hunting for that
exhibit, and states that, as far as its recollection
serves, it was raw hide, or hide dried in the sun.
It sa y s a request has been sent to Australia for
further samples. The Bulletin is afraid that

HIS Company is being formed to acquire from the present holders their entire interest in Gold
Mining Lease No. 533 (known as McKenzie’s, and having an area of 15 acres), and immediately
adioining McAuliffe’s Lease No. 156, which was recently purchased by Lord Percy Douglas and Mr.
VV A Mercer for a London Syndicate. The purchase money paid for this property being £6500 in
*h ’ The other adjoining blocks have been purchased at large prices by Adelaide Companies, From
id vices since received, great disappointment was felt by English representatives in not having acquired
this property^ ye bgen seen> by tbe repor t s appearing in the daily press, the White Feather portion of
the Coolgardie goldfield has been brought into great prominence of late, which has been largely
increased by the series of purchases made on behalf of English capitalists.
From the subjoined Reports by well-known mining authorities, there are two known reefs running
through the property, varying in size from Ito 2 feet, in a N.W. and S.E. course. There also appears
to be a third vertical reef, but upon which no work has been done up to the present.
The property also contains some very rich leaders, and doubtless some of these will be found to
junction in depth, giving place to another rich reef. It will be noticed that the original proprietor has
made the property pay from the start by merely dollying the stone in a primitive manner. The ad-
joining properties have also been paying in a similar way.
There is an ample supply of Mining and Milling timber in the immediate vicinity. As to water,
a most important factor in this district, there is a good and permanent supply obtainable from a lake
about three miles from the mine. Besides which, it is confidently expected that a sufficient supply will
be met with in sinking at a moderate depth.
It is estimated that the Capital to be placed to the credit of the Company, £5250, will be more
than ample to open up the mine, erect the necessary machinery, and place it in a dividend-paying
positi >n, when the smallness of the capital, £12,500, will tell most favourably in the results.
1 k The Company will be declared formed when 20,000 shares have been applied for.
After allotment of the shares, a meeting of allottees will be convened by the Provisional Directors
for the purpose of electing Directors and adopting Memorandum and Articles of Association.
The only Agreement for the sale of the property is one dated 12th May, 1894, between J. R.
M'Kenzie and others, which can be inspected at the Company’s Office, 131 Pitt-street, Sydney.
Application for Shares to be made on the accompanying form-to any of the above-named brokers.
