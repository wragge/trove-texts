The Newest Drama
Some ultra-modern players are providing an
unusual example of what can be done with-
out stage effects. They are called the London
Radio Repertory Players, and their presen-
tations are now a fair-sized part of Eng-
land’s entertainment. There are scoffers, of
course, who consider them an ephemeral
band of cranks, the product of a passing
craze; but they have at least aroused the
united opposition of many theatre managers.
The demands of an inimitably vast audience
have given birth to this wholly new art—
the broadcast drama., Plays bolstered up by
scenery and effects proved themselves next
to useless when denuded of this support.
The wireless play introduced a fresh tech-
nique, whose presentations are dependent
upon sound only, just as the cinematograph
relies upon visual representations, with, of
course, some -assistance from the written
word.
Obviously this new drama cannot depend
at all upon stage effects; and this deficiency
•—if it is one —has to bo balanced. So the
play itself must have sufficient claim upon
the intellect to make it worth while without
spectacular stage assistance. It must pro-
vide its own setting; the scene, the locale
and all the essential adjuncts must be cun-
ingly woven, by suggestion, into the dia-
logue, so that, almost without knowing it,
the audience absorbs the necessary “atmo-
sphere.” And even more skill is required
in the revealing of character. Still, it is
all being done; a new art is developing, its
limitations throwing proportionately greater
responsibility upon playwright and player.
.1. C. W. Keith, managing director of the
British Broadcasting Co., to whose vision
England owes much of its “fireside” amuse-
ment, said: “The plays of Shakspeare fulfil
to a great extent the requirements of wireless
drama, for he had little in the way of setting
add >nery, and relied - chiefly upon the
his plot and the conviction of the
to convey his ideas.” In other
le broadcasters’ handicaps are simi-
akspeare’s; and the degree of sue-
ned in overcoming them indicates
actual standard of a play. Tho
y of a 'drama to broadcasting can
show its real merit,
ays have their own setting, it is
„ are far from a mere reading of
.... ivBS. A sharp distinction in the players’
voices gives depth and color to the produc-
tion. and 'vocal “expression” is used more
freely to compensate for the absence of
action. Then there are the effects —or are
they tricks?—which can be produced by
sound. These are not the crude noises which
often issue from the orchestra or from off-
stage in a theatre or cinema, but artistically
produced sounds in accord with what is at
the time probably the mental picture of each
member of the audience. Yet compared with
the elaborate stage-settings employed by even
the most brilliant playwrights, they are only
a fractional part of the production. Hence
the demands of these presentations are a
severer test than those of the “visible” stage,
with its mechanical effects and the gestures
which so often give an inane sentence a
sensual meaning.
To set up the broadcast play as a chal-
lenger of the ordinary stage, from an intel-
lectual or any other aspect—except peidiaps
that of convenience-—would, on the face of
. it, be rather ridiculous. Approaching the
audience from a different point and through
a different medium, the methods must neces-
sarily vary. But this entirely original type
of drama is a striking instance of what is
being done in presenting stiri-ing plays to a
huge audience without what Mr. Esson lately
called “tawdry devices” and “out-worn con-
ventions”—an art divested of even the inspi-.
ration of glamoi*ous footlights aiql encourag-
ing applause. And perhaps this new drama,
borne, to use Milton’s words, by
aery tongues which syllable men’s names
On sands, and shores and desert -wildernesses,
is the forerunner of the stage’s intellec-
tual recovery. At least, it makes a direct
appeal to the intelligence of its audience,
whereas stage effects, at the best, leave the
intellect but half-satisfied.
ALAN BURROWS.
Rabindranath Tagore
Tagore’s poems in prose have made him
a greater world-figure than Ghamli. Since
the political aim of the t>vo men is identical
the association of their names fallows as a
natural sequence. Yet between the means
by which they would gain home rule for
India there is a gulf. Ghandi, with his
method of passive resistance, would bring it
about by a bloodless revolution. But Tagore,
who has no sympathy with the separatist
movement, violent or otherwise, would have
self-government come into being by way of
mutual understanding and mutual respect
for all that is great in East and West. To
the idea of some of the educated Indians
that India should become completely west-
ernised he is strongly -opposed. India
should cling to her national indivi-
duality, her spiritual heritage. Not only
has she need of them, but they are necessary
to the commonwealth of the world. If India
becomes free in soul and preserves her spiri-
tual individuality, he believes that all other
things shall be added unto her. And among
“all other things” he includes the greatness
that is England’s. “It is idle mendicancy to
discard our own and beg for the foreign,”
he says. “It is the abjectness of poverty
to dwarf ourselves by rejecting the foreign.”
If India cuts herself adrift from England,
she is at the mercy of other nations; and if
for the time being she mpst be a subject
race, he would choose English 'fetters before
all others.
The expression “England’s greatness” is
not interpreted by Tagore in terms of
Empire and national wca u h. “There is a
living soul in Western civilisation,” he says,
“which rebels against the deep distrust in
man, that cynical contempt for his sacred
rights which finds expression in the policies
of Governments.” It is to the English people
rather than their Government that he looks
for India’s liberation. A nation that has
bled and struggled for liberty as England has
bled and struggled possesses something far
greater than the jingoist, on whose dominions
the sun never sets, can imagine. The coming
of England, whether she willed it or not,
roused India to a sense of freedom. She
stirred Eastern thought from the sloth into
which it had fallen under the opiate of the
religious ideal of Sankara, with its paradise
of nothingness. She brought to the East a
sense of law and order. Between the old
logic of negation—the inaction of asceticism
—and the active human philosophy of
Tagore, there is a gulf. His philosophy goes
back to days before the coming of Sankara,
when Indian thought was influenced by the
ancient wisdom of the Upanishads and the
BhagavadgTta. His religion is wide enough
to admit Brahmins, Christians and Hindus
to his school at Bolpur.
To understand Tagore’s turning away from
an asceticism that abhors the world, it is
only necessary to read a few lines of his
work, when, at the height of his poesy, he
writes of Nature. Nature to him is a revela-
tion of God. God speaks in the tempest and
in the still, small voice of the zephyr. “The
trees, the stars and the blue hills ache with
a meaning which can never be uttered in
words.” There is nothing mean or common
in the realm of Nature, who gives with both
hands. “The dust receives insult, and in
return offers her flowers.” Tagore’s temple
is a place where Nature and the human soul
meet in union. The cloister is a prison-
house, shutting out the revelations of God.
Tagore is a heretic. “Away with religions,”
he cries, “and let us have religion.” Yet
he has a creed—“l believe that in a little
flower there is a living power hidden in
beauty which is more potent than a Maxim-
gun. I believe that in the bird’s notes Nature
expresses herself with a force which is
greater than that revealed in the deafening
roar of the cannonade.... I believe that a
vision of Paradise is to be seen in the sun-
light, the green of the earth, in the flowing
streams, in the beauty of springtime and the
repose of a winter morning.” All creation
is God’s mouthpiece, and He speaks most
clearly through the soul of man. God is
the universe, the universe is God.
If I say that He is within me, the universe is ashamed ;
If I say that He is without me, it is falsehood.
If God is immanent in the universe, how can
the human body be scorned as dross? There
is nothing untouchable in the great body of
God, mankind.
It is on the humanist issue that Tagore
finds greatest fault with his beloved India.
India, he says, has brought herself to her
present condition by neglect of her masses.
The West is threatened because of its
worship of becoming. India is threat-
ened because for so many centuries
she has been content with being. He
indicts the West for feeding the flesh
and starving the soul; the East for feeding
the soul and starving the body. The ideal
is a partnership of the two, and in a union
of what is best in West and East he sees
the hope of the world. The two viewpoints
are complementary, not antagonistic.
This practical mystic, who has a know-
ledge of national and international affairs
which many a politician might envy, calls
to the dreamers of his country: “Come out
of thy meditations and leave aside the flow-
ers and incense. What harm if thy clothes
become tattered and stained?” There is
much to be done. The caste system, which
has lost its soul, must go. #lndia must be
purged of her superstitions, her religious
pride, her prejudices and her million untouch -
ables must be brought into touch with the
divine humanity that is the heritage of all
men. “Only human fellowship can make
God real to man. Asceticism and mutila-
tion of the body calumniate God, the Author
of all being.” But work in the temporal
world should not shut out a vision of the
Infinite. “O grant my prayer,” he cries,
“that I may never lose the bliss of the touch
of the One in the play of the many!” Never
must the cure for social unrest, which of
necessity deals with the material, have any
other basis than the spiritual. ■' ' t
No English patriot looks more eagerly fhf.
England to prove her greatness than does
this Eastern poet-philosopher who has done
so mueh to keep in check the violence of
the Indian .extremists. But greatness has
many interpretations. Tagore interprets it
in terms of guidance and sympathy for .-a
subject race struggling towards freedom. He
interprets jt as the generosity which some,
day he hopes and believes will move the’
English people to give to India the gift of
political freedom.
IRENE WILKINSON.
Roland in Italy
“The Song of Roland” acknowledges its
forebears, and leaves scope for its successors.
This is the generous way of the great ancient
epic; so it was with the “Iliad” and the
Trojan cycle. But our case is better with
Roland than with Achilles; we can watch
the fascinating metamorphosis of an heroic
figure from the fighting saint of God who
fell in the dolorous pass of Roncisvalle to
the jilted lover of the minx Angelica.
“They went forth to the battle, but they
always fell.” Achilles, Patroclus, Hector,
Sigurd, Roland—that is the first and nearest
thing about them. The hero falls, and falls
young. Afterwards the people want to know
and the minstrel wants to tell of that hero’s
past. Now, as there is no saga or legend
apart from poetry (a hundred years have
taught us not to imagine such a vain thing,
and we know, at the cost of much dear illu-
sion, that we cannot break the charmed circle
of litei’ature), we are made witnesses to the
pious and dutiful work of poets who, with
utter disregard of their own name and fame,
sought simply to link up, all having their
hearts in their subject and each desiring to
honor his predecessors.

at DAVID JONES’
So, then, first in order of poetry, lie fell.
But he was a mighty hero; how came he to
be so? What was his first feat, of arms?
And, iast, wliat was he as a boy?
“Lcs TJnfances” —the Childhood-story—
was a necessary form into which the saga,
not merely of Roland but even of his majes-
tic uncle, Charlemagne, had to fit itself'.
Young Roland, then, comes to us first m the
“Song of Asprcmont.” Charles is holding
high court at Laon. Enter the challenger;
his Saracen king has invaded Christendom
at the toe of Italy, “the wild ridge off Aspro-
moute” round which George Gissing, as he
tells us in the best-loved of all his books,
saw the lightning’s flash. Charles goes to
meet the dire pair, father and son —Agolante
and Almonte. Roland is not yet of age to
fight; he and his mates are entrusted to
the charge of that “proud porter” with whom
our own ballad-literature has made us so
familiar. They beat the proud porter, and
get to the front. In the first battle, when
Charles is rolling on the ground in deadly
grips with the young Almonte, “under the
tree beside the spring,” Roland, who has
never wielded arms, before, seizes the trun-
cheon of a spear, and saves his emperor.
So, when the great battle against the father
is won, he receives investiture: from
Almonte, the quarterings of liis shield and
the great sword Durendal, once, in the older
poem, sent down to him from Heaven. All
future poetry will take Aspromonte for
granted. In the grandiose finale of Pulci’s
“Morgante”—that “Passion of Roland” —
when the hosts of evil and of good are met
in the dire strait, “the banner in the van
-was that of Almonte, which the young
Roland gat him in Aspromonte.”
Once got to Italy, the hero must stay
there. The people like him ; and so comes
about the tale of his boyhood. How his
mother offended Charles by marrying a poor
knight, Milone, and they lived, as true bush-
lovers, down at Sutri, north of Rome, until
the great king came and held court there on
his way to the Pope. And Young-Roland
vexed that Court with his pranks, and so
was discovered. This is Italian invention,
the “Orlandino” —Little Roland.
But higher and serious things were on
the way with him, though the literary form
might seem ludicrously incongruous. A
mixed jargon of French and Italian never
spoken by any other human being than the
minstrels who declaimed the storia del pro
Orlando does not seem a promising medium.
Yet,, as we know, the North Italian public,
particularly in the March of Treviso,
crowded round the reciters, and at least one
poet produced important and lasting work in
this composite dialect. He was a Paduan,
and wrote in the middle of the fourteenth
century a poem of considerable extent, like
all the later chansons de f/este, which, as it
has been well said, succumbed to fatty degen-
eration. His poem was called the “Entree
d’Espagne,” and is made out of two hints
in the “Song of Roland”; first, the seven
years’ duration of the Spanish campaign;
second, the quarrel between Charles and
Roland consequent on the latter’s taking the
town of Nobles contrary to orders. For this
lie has to endure not merely his uncle’s re-
buke, but the blow direct; in high dudgeon
he renounces his allegiance, and disappears
into the ill-defined lands of Paynimrie, deter-
mined to end his days there. But, of course,
he is destined to other things. He conquers
and converts the ancient East, Babylon and
Syria, and, returning by way of Italy, re-
ceives from the Pope the title of Roman
Senator and an army of thirty thousand men,
whom he leads as Gonfalonier of Holy
Church.
The Paduan’s inventions were canonical
for the later Italians. This simple motive
will be regularly worked to bring about the
absence, not merely of Roland, but of the
other paladins. Boiardo’s innovation will
be to get them all away on the traces of
Angelica. Of these paladins, again, Italy
adds two who put all the others in the shade,
one even threatening to eclipse Roland him-
self. The first is practically the creation
of the Paduan, though he found the name in
the “Song of Aspremont.” It is Estous, one
of the squires entrusted, along with the
young Roland, to the keeping of that “proud
porter.” Him the Paduan turns into mad-
cap and frolic creature, witty himself and
the cause of wit in others, prone to vapor
and yet both brave and gentlemanly. He
wall become the much-beloved Astolfo, at
whom all the world laughs and with whom it
condoles, for that, though his courage was
high, his luck was always out. It adds to
the fun that he should be the Duke of Eng-
land, and that he should come by title and
nationality by a mere phonetic change. He
came from Lengres, and so was Lengrois.
But r and 1 can pass into each other, so he be-
came Lenglois, and that naturally turned
into L’Englois. The other paladin, the dar-
ling of the Tuscan public, was never, in
French poetry, a peer of Charlemagne, but,
with his three brothers, a rebel and an out-
law, relentlessly pursued by his suzerain.
This is Rcnaud of Montauban, one of the
four sons of Aymon, rider of the marvellous
steed Bayard—and, amazingly, the hero of
a quite different legend, for he is no other
than that Saint Renaut or Reinolt who had
his church at Dortmund. To the Italians
who called him Rinaldo he was rather the
scapegrace and rascal, and he comes near
to ousting, his great cousin (for they are
all made into one kindred) from pride of
place. And here again it is an amusing
error in transcription. It is in Tuscan that
the name Roland becomes, by metathesis,
Orlando; before that it was Rolando. Now
it was the regular habit to indicate a proper
name by the simple initial. And so the R
that meant Roland was often taken for
Rinaldo. and Peter was robbed to pay Paul.
The Paduan did not invent Roland’s great
Saracen antagonist, the giant Ferragus, of
the stock of Goliath, specially brought from
the East to the aid of his Spanish kin in
Islam, but he was the first to give him in-
dividuality.. This swarthy Saracen is an-
other favorite figure in Italian romance, and
is even one of the most persistent wooers of
Angelica. It is interesting to find him in
Middle English poetry as Vernagu, a name
by which the Paynims swear.
CHEIS. BRENNIN.
Form in Poetry
It is always the weedy barracker who
knows most about the athletic game, and
the “old maid” who gives the most advice
about marriage and children. If a man has
proved a failure as a creator, he cap at
least turn critic upon the work of others
who did succeed; or he can give up the
hopeless chase for fame and accept notoriety
as the next best thing. If he cannot be an
immortal, at least he may be a vogue. When
an artist discovers that he can never sit
with Michelangelo, he can always turn
cubist or futurist, and the desired crowds
will come and stare, fearful of committing
themselves lest there be some subtle genius in
the impudent fraud, hidden from the mere
Philistine.
I suppose all this is touchingly human,
and only the cynic would sneer at those who
have striven hard and failed. It is a fine
thing at least to have aimed high; but I
would break a vigorous lance with those who
would proclaim the fantastic foolery of the
cubist as high art, or the highbrow drivel of
the Ezra Pounders as eclectic poetry.
To take Walt Whitman as an example—
and he is a polished literary craftsman com-
pared with many of his followers, who over-
did the thing altogether and queered the
pitch. Whitman had a following only be-
cause he set a new fashion in verse-writing,
and liis success was that of the cubist. He
chopped up prose into uneven lengths, the
divisions being anywhere; began the lines
with capitals, and so achieved a thing that
was sure to have a run—a verse that was
“different.” Take away these petty aids to
the eye, and you have but bald and obvious
prose of no special merit. Yet the bewildered
critics felt, and rightly, that the highest
poetry could be written in such a measure
—old Jeremiah did it, and so did the writer
of the Book of Job —for the simple reason
that poetic inspiration does not depend upon
any set form of metre or scansion for its
expression. But quaint and rather intrigu-
ing' form without real content is mere
literary humbug. Partisans will, of course,
use phrases about rough-hewn beauty, ele-
mental poetry, and so on, and even perhaps
build up a tradition around Walt Whitman,
as honest old Sam Johnson did for the
totally worthless Richard Savage, who is
still quite seriously quoted as one of the
English classics. But partisanship is not
proof.
Here is a complete poem (I think the
number of dots is correct) by Ezra Pound,
entitled “Papyrus”:
Spring . . .
Too long . . .
Gongula . . .
What are we to think of the mentality of a
writer who would publish that —and. what
must be his estimate of the public intelli-
gence? But the thing was a novelty, and
this cult in poetry lias been taken quite seri-
ously, reviewed and discussed, and searched
for new possible cryptic excellences, whereas
it? fact it was only a peculiarly insufferable
new kind of pose of authors who had evi-
dently decided that art is long—-too long to
bother about attaining.
Chesterton has remarked whimsically that
there is no clearer sign of want of originality
among poets than tlieir disposition to find
new topics; and lie might have added new
forms of verse. To the inspired writer both
the subject and the measure come inevitably,
and fondness for the more artificial verse-
forms betrays the laboring verse-craftsman
who is distinct from the poet. Some achieve
the unusual by commencing each line with a
small letter, or by the cheap emphasis of
italics; but I have never yet seen a consider-
able poem thus handicapped with the brand
of the workshop. Neither have I ever seen
(nor has any man yet) a rondeau that was
great poetry, nor a triolet that was worth
the writing at all. Dc Croy penned this one
in the fifteenth century, and the thousands
which have followed are neither worse nor
better, because no man dances spontaneously
in chains, nor renders real music on a
penny whistle: —
Je
Bois:
Si
Je
Ne
Vois,
Je
Bois.
Such freak lyrics are but literary exercises,
verbal acrobatics, the jazz of poetry. Only the
literary climber who has relinquished the
hopeless heights of Olympus specialises m
form, which is the easiest thing in poetry.
But perhaps one cannot dogmatise on the
subject of literary taste: and. after all, as
the French say, only the young know every-
tiling.
J. M. D.
A Satchel of Books
Hugh Stanford’s Luck, by Mary Grant Bruce (Angus
and Robertson). This Victorian writer’s latest
book has good Australian atmosphere, is pleasantly
told, written with a sympathetic pen, and has
many quiet touches of human nature.
The Shadow Captain, by E. B. and A. A. Knipe
(John Lane). Captain Kidd, whose piratical doings
have furnished much material for romance, once
more serves this purpose. The story is told skilfully,
and until the close of the book the reader is left in
suspense.
The Hills of Hate, by E. V. Timms (Angus and
Robertson). A virile Australian story, though
rough-cut and without pretence to literary quality.
It turns upon a family feud begotten out of rivalry
in love, and after many exciting and blood-letting
incidents ends in a happy reunion by marriage
between the two houses.
Zoe Middlemisb, Governess, by Bridget Kennedy
(Werner Laurie). A novel cast in Wotz, one of
the dirtiest and most squalid of the densely popu-
lated towns of Russian Poland, does not promise a
feast of dainty literary fare; but the writer introduces
skilful touches of character and purple patches of
elementary sex-passion. Apparently a first novel,
giving promise of better work.
Overdue, by J. M. Walsh (N.S.W.. Bookstall Go.).
A tale of travel and adventure with a love interest
thrown in. It purports to be a romance of unknown
New Guinea, and, though the local color is used
sparingly, it helps to give an atmosphere to the
book. The story is told lucidly and holds the
attention in moving incidents by sea and land as
well as by the attraction of some of its characters.
Banker and Customer in Australia, by F. A. A.
Russell, M.A. (Law Book Co. of Australia). The
author entered the service of the old A.J.S. Bank in
1885, but abandoned the career of a banker for one
of law after the ’nineties, taking his Master’s degree
in Arts in the stride. The present work was first
published in 1907, and soon gained recognition as a
text-book. Alterations in the law have long since
called for a revision of the text —a call now met
with a second edition, in which the substance of the
volume has been revised and brought up to date. Its
clear treatment of law and practice makes it of both
interest and importance to trader as well as banker
and student.
Peter Meiklejolin, by C. Stewart Black (Werner
Laurie). An ambitious venture in a first novel; and
the ambition is largely realised. Peter was a “poor
scholar” at the University of “Glaskie” in the
sixteenth century, and a picturesque description of
students’ life in those days is followed by a brisk
recountal of his many subsequent adventures as a
soldier, monk and vagrant gipsy. The environment
is novel, and the writer makes his history sound
true.
Behind the Screens (Lothian). This is a little
book of critical and suggestive comment on hospitals
and their management by a writer with the pen-name
of “Autre Droit.” The object of the writer is to
discuss some of the problems of a great profession
and to ask what standards are being held before
students and trainees in the public hospitals. The
author asks especially whether the time lias not
arrived when the standard of the nurse should be
raised and the conditions of the trainees improved.
Value, Price and Profit (Allen and Unwin). A
paper addressed by Karl Marx to working men and
found among other literary remains after his death.
It is now published for the first time, under the
editorship of his daughter, Eleanor Marx Aveling.
The paper is in effect an epitome of the first volume
of “Capital.” As remarked in a preface, “More
than one of us have attempted to analyse and
simplify that volume with not too much success
perhaps.” Nor is this brief volume very successful
in clearing away the clouds from the arguments of
the obscurantist philosopher.
The Beading Girl, by Coulson Kernahan (Harrap).
These saunters in Bookland and chats on the choice
of books and method of reading are conducted by
an author whose experience as editor, publisher's
reader and reviewer has enabled him to cover a
wide field. “Were I,” he writes, “a schoolmaster,
my aim would be, not to ‘cranT pupils, not to
string facts and dates together, but to develop
character, to arouse interest, to train the mind, and
to indicate underlying principles. That is what I
have tried to bear in mind in writing these chapters.”
The book is chatty and entertaining a.s well as
instructive, the meat of instruction being made
palatable by a sauce of apt illustration and anecdote.
The Bodley Head Quartos (John Lane). Every
notable publishing house likes to be distinguished by
some service to standard literature. That chosen by
the house over which the late John Lane for so many
years presided takes the form of quartos devoted to
the disinterment of fragments from their neglected
graves in the libraries of the universities, of public
bodies and of collectors of rare books. The latest
to be issued are John Marston’s “The Scourge of
Villanie” (1599), Samuel Daniel’s “A Defence of
Ryme” (1603) and Thomas Campion’s “Observations
in the Art of English Poesie” (1602). To each an
interesting introduction is furnished which gives the
reader a conception of the place filled by the work
in the literature of its time and provides a critical
estimate of its value.
Jacob Ussher, by Naomi Jacob (Thornton Butter-
worth). The story deals with Jewish character
rather than with its environment, the central figure,
Jacob, being a man of great riches who through
the financial genius of his race lifts himself and his
family from Whitechapel to the West End. Though
out of touch with his ancient faith, Jacob preserves
in the heart of the Gentile world all the character-
istics of his race. Marrying into an aristocratic
family, he has a daughter by his wife, who subse-
quently divorces him, and the interest of the story
turns upon the conflicting personalities of father and
daughter and a war of wills in which the lay-figure
is a not too attractive young man, amiable but
inefficient. The character drawing is excellent and
the dialogues marked by clear insight. Powerful
work.
Personality as a Business Asset, by I. B. Wolcott
(Putnam’s).‘This is a characteristic American produc-
tion calculating to a nicety the dollar-value of good
grooming to the business man, whose salvation, it
seems, depends on the right color and adjustment
of his tie and the accurate pressing of liis pants.
Personality as expressed in the terms of,the tailor,
tjhe hosier, the bootmaker and the rest is, says the
author, “more powerful than beauty, more effective
than intelligence.... Your personality sells your
services All of us, from the small boy with his
newspapers to the captains of industry, are trying
to sell something. But before anyone can sell a
thing he must first of all sell his personality. That
is one reason why personality is of such tremendous
importance." An excellent advt. for “Our unsurpassed
five-guinea ready-made suit.”
Modernism as a Working' Faith, by W. Maurice
Pryke (Heffers). The author, an English rector, is
a representative of tjie school of Modernism within
the Anglican Church. He contends that the position
of the traditionalist holding fast to a fixed faith in
an infallible Bible is imperilling the Christian life
of to-day. “Apart from Modernism,” he declares,
“Christianity has no future, since without it that
unification of religion with modern thought for which
the Modernist is working, the gulf between the
churches and the man in Uhe street must grow con-
tinually wider, until at length religion and obscuran-
tism shall have become almost interchangeable terms,
and that unhappy identification of faith with cred-
ulity, towards which many in our own day appear to
be moving, shall have attained its completion.” The
author makes out a strong case for his creed that
the life of the Church depends not upon traditional
insistence, with its concomitants of an infallible and
revealed word, but on “loyalty to the values of
Christ.”
The Tragic Life ‘of Vincent Van Gogh, by Louis
Pierard, translated by Herbert Garland (John Castle).
“Ah, we lunatics,” cries Van Gogh in a letter,
“haven’t we an eye!” The perception is undoubtedly
there. Some of the Dutchman’s landscapes have the
uncanny vividness of the epileptic’s vision. A high-
priest of the modernist movement in painting, he
suffered from what the psycho-analysts call a Nar-
cissus-complex. He tried first to transfer his self-
love to an outside object in an English girl, who
rebuffed him; next to his cousin, who fled from
him in horror; then to the miners of Le Bormage,
the terrible Black Country of Belgium, where he went
as a missionary; then to Gauguin, the painter of
decadent South Sea idylls ; and finally, after slicing
off one of his ears and sending it as a present to
a lady of his acquaintance, he achieved emancipation
bv climbing a tree and shooting himself. In between
his maniacal outbursts he painted his most famous
pictures. In this book Pierard, a disciple, has
collected the most intimate facts about him.
*
“P. Plain”: The late E. F. G. Jolley, M.H.R., had
a clever pen. Many of the most popular songs of
present-day Melbourne ’Varsity students were written
by him over 30 years ago. The following Swinburnian
parody, surely too good to be lost, was dashed off
on the occasion of a “kitchen tea” when something
special was wanted by a young lady to go with a
potato-masher, and I appealed to Ted Jolley for help.
I have just come across them again on going r igh
some old papers:—
WITH A POTATO-MASHER.
This pillar of pitch-bearing pine from th peaks
of the pole-pointing precincts of pen-pictured
Norway,
Rounded and rolled till the resinous remnants of
rind were removed from the rames to the root,
May it dangle downstairs as it drowsily droops, or
depend from a dowel dug deep in thy doorway.
Swaying and swinging in sweet sweeping swerves
from the straining string circloid suspending
its foot.
Proud in its promise of properly pulverised spuds, and
betokening batter-built by-ways,
And foods farinaceous and fragrant and fresh as
the fish that a freshet floats out on its foam,
Handy to hammer the head of a husband who hints
that his hash should be hurled in the high-
ways,
Or to heave at the haunch of a hound, hunger
harassed, who haunts with his howling the
harmonic home.

Protect Your New Ford
#
“During the first 200 miles do not drive this
car at a speed exceeding 20 miles per hour.”
These instructions will be found pasted to the wind-
screen glass of your new Ford when you take delivery.
They are put there—right where you cannot fail to see
them—because of their great importance.
It is an accepted fact that new machinery must be
permitted to work itself in; it must not be speeded up
in its early life if it is to perform its functions properly,
and give the service expected of it.
The Ford Company knowing this to be so, and desirous
of seeing you get the very best out of its popular car,
warn you against driving fast until such time as the
motor has had a chance to get into its stride.
The manufacturers know the car from radiator cap to
differential—every bolt and every nut from end to end
•—and wisdom dictates that their instructions concerning
lubrication be strictly adhered to. Those instructions are
easy to follow—but not by guesswork!
Reference to the instruction book supplied with the car
shows that there are certain times at which oil must be
put in the sump and grease placed in the grease cups.
For instance, at each 100 miles you must add oil to
the motor; at each 200 miles oil must be put in the oil
cups; at each 500 miles certain bearing surfaces on
the chassis should be oiled, and so on. There is only
one possible method of accurately determining when
these times have arrived —by using a mileage recorder.
The best mileage recorder the owner of a Ford can
have is the Stewart Ford Speedometer—a special model
of the world-renowned Speedometer fitted as standard
equipment by the great majority of car builders.
This unique accessory is not only an accurate speed
indicator and an unfailing recorder of mileage travelled,
but is, in addition, a veritable “Adviser on Oiling” to
the F ord owner. It operates exactly as does the regular
Stewart Speedometer— on the proved magnetic principle
—and requires no more attention than that instrument.
Having decided on the purchase of a new Ford your
very next step should be to see that it is fitted with this
Stewart Ford Speedometer.
A moment’s reflection will convince you of the wisdom
of this step. You are instructed—for the good of the car
and the good of your own pocket—to apply oil and
grease at stated mileages: The speedometer is the only
thing on the car that can inform you the distances
travelled—hence it is the only accessory that will furnish
you with information that will enable you to decide when
a certain part or certain parts are due to receive oil.
The Ford Dealer with whom you place your order will
gladly arrange for the fitting of this special Stewart
Speedometer, and remember that it is the one speed-
ometer with the oil-guide feature—therefore
insist on the Stewart. PRICE

“Why, she looks as young and charming as her daughter.” How
often have vou heard these words spoken about women who have retained
their girlish appearance while their family is quickly growing up around
them! Have you ever stopped to think what the real secret of their
youth is? The "turning-point of youth to early middle-age comes when a
little silvery grev creeps in amongst that crowning glory of women —their
hair. No matter the youthful bloom upon the cheek, or the figure its easy
girlish form, the hair appearance is the mirror of the age.
Stop for a moment and think of the really smart women that you
know; they do not allow those tell-tale grey hairs, the unmistakable symbol
of advancing years, to creep in and spoil their beauty.
Grev hair can never be fashionable —it is the first sign of old age. A
man may be as old as he feels—but a woman is as old as her hair.
Dr. ‘Allen’s Mexican Walnut Stain has enjoyed the confidence of women
for 25 years—it is perfectly harmless, easy to apply, immediate in action,
and above all, undetectable. Carefully carry out the instructions and let
it restore your hair to its natural shade. Grey hairs will vanish like magic
and youth will walk in at your door.

The Purpose.
Be the bloom for a day, be the song for a
passing hour,
Life seeks but this,
That the moment of truth and the moment
of living power
It shall not miss.
Rome for an age and Rome again for the
ages:
Athens a moment only!
Yet Athens lives and lives in her golden
pages
Lovely and lonely.
Be the glory dust or a shining for ever and
ever,
Life is seeking still
The clear, fair way where nought shall arise
to sever
The dream from the will.
Let the day’s song die, let the proud sun
wither the flower,
Life yet shall climb
The flaming peak of truth till the moment
of power
Shall fill all time.

The Rescue.
I feel that I have failed, nor greatly care,
The wine being poured and drunk, that it
is so.
An elfin Puckish boy has seized despair
By his long, ass-like ears and laid him low
Beneath the table where we sat at wine.
Nor did I turn to joy who lightly flits,
Partnerless, as the dancers intertwine;
But gathering up my poor deluded wits
I left the revels of that sour-sweet place
Where rue hides with the flowers they
call fame,
And snatched my rescuer up and kissed his
face
And begged him fly with me, nor breathe
his name.
Out in the thick, sweet dark swiftly we ran ;
And I was clinging to the great god Pan!
VICTORIA.
LLYWELYN LUCAS.
The Tui.
All day the sun between the latticed leaves
Deep in the bush his questing beams has
played. , . , ,
Like one in search of something lie believes
An over-anxious carefulness mislaid,
He probes ivith hand and mind,
Half-halting and half-blind,
Groping for that he hardly hopes to find.
Be still and wait! The latticed leaves now
part, *
And like a shattered crystal silence falls
Broken at sound’s swift feet. Is this a heart,
Captured by Love, a passionate heart that
calls?
The sun that searched the vines
In high approval shines,
And to the bird’s recessional declines.
Be still that there may be similitude
Betweeii you and the revereuce of the
hour!
What notes are these from the enchanted
wood, . _ . „
What buds of music bursting into flower?
Note after luted note
Floats as from Arion’s boat
To Echo, dumb with envy in her throat.
This is not song; it is a golden bar
Greater than song, though but a songs
surmise.
It is a voice as of the morning star
Rising new-batlied from ocean to the skies,
A voice that is endowed
With being far more proud
Than vaunted kings to whom old courtiers
bowed.
Be still! Be still and let the glory fade
With that slight thing bemusfed day long
sought,
And in his last impatience disarrayed
The cloudy west where his gold bed was
wrought!
Oil, let not even such
As the least tarnished touch
Of other sound the welkin vex <> !
Short flight and song! Could these but be
prolonged
Sweet Philomel of the Athenian glades
Might languish in those airs that still are
thronged
With Sapphic memories and 1 liaonic
shades.
Song’s noblest unexpressed,
Love’s ardor unconfessed
Transcend all themes in grandeur they
suggest!
Oh, golden bar! A prelude to what theme?
Only unhurried ages shall make known
The culminated paean and supreme
That in your sliadow-song is all your own.
No Grecian lyric host
In its night-choir can boast
Your pregnant state with song’s iucarnate
ghost. .
Your notes are yours, for you have drawn
upon
A world you found still in the virgin state;
And neither Caesar nor Napoleon
In tyrant tumults did so much create
As you—as you who saw
In the revolt from Law
Peace bleeding ’neatli the talon and the claw.
Peace in the wind and in the star and wave!
Peace where loud trumpets blare and the
drums roll
Their ordered squadrons grandly to the
grave!
Peace in the mind and far within the soul,
In hovel and in street,
Peace almost oversweet
Like angels carolling at Jesus’ feet!

IS LABOR COMMUNIST?
Federal Labor-leader Charlton and his
lieutenants are assuring Australia that they
have no connection with Communism, and
that Communism has no place at all in the
Labor platform. Charlton may be ashamed
of the connection ; he may even not be fully
aware that it exists; but it is there all right.
The programme drafted by “uncouth crooks”
(to use the historic plyase of N. S. Wales
Speaker Dooley) and others, to be adopted
whole and advocated in its entirety by Fed-
eral candidates, is a Moscow document in
every detail. It is raw Communism, slung
together in haste, and it shows confusion of
thought as well as tedious repetition. Should
a Labor Government emerge as the result
of the elections it will be pledged to 26 items
of policy, among which are these: —
(1) The nationalisation of industry, production,
distribution and exchange. [The word used is “social-
isation,” but as the document proceeds to nationalise
the things separately the two terms evidently mean
the same thing.]
(4) Nationalisation of banking and all principal
industries.
(11) Nationalisation of banking and insurance.
(13) Nationalisation of monopolies.
(16) Commonwealth freight and passenger steamers.
[This is amply covered by the “industry, distribution
and exchange” proposition, but it is apparently
put in again to make sure.]
(24) National monopoly of assurance, including
sick, accident, life and unemployment. [This is
already provided for by items Nos. l, 4 and 11,
but though it has been stated that the dog shall bo
fatally injured, killed and slain there is no harm
in adding that it shall be dead as a guarantee
against misconception.]
In addition it is set forth (Clause 5) that
industries may be municipalised, as well as
socialised and nationalised, thereby load-
ing the gun in all three barrels.
* * * *
Looking first at this programme fi'om
the point of view of the possessor of
something—it may be a farm or it
may be a factory—it will be observed
that no provision is hinted at for paying
anybody for the seizure of his land, in-
cluded under “production” (No. 1) and
“monopolies” (No. yl3), or for the confisca-
tion of his business 7 or his interest in bank-
ing, insurance, shipping or other concerns.
Their transfer to the clumsy hands of Red
leaders will apparently be pure steal. This
omission, however, is of little importance,
there being no possible means of payment
except with tons of that unsecured paper
which is presently worth Id. in the £ or
Jess. The idea is simply the Bolshevik one
of robbery in the nude—the taking of com-
plicated apparatus from experts, and the
transfer of it to unprincipled babes. Pro-
vision is made for boards and more boards
to bring their wealth of inexperience to bear
on the management problem. The absence
of any scheme for financing this kind of Gov-
ernment after the robberies are completed
is, as usual, a further weak point of the pro-
gramme. Government activities have a
knack, even now, of exempting themselves
from taxes in order to put a better face on
things. The idea of collecting land-tax,
income-tax, war-time profits-tax or probate
and succession duty from the Queensland
railways and the Commonwealth shipping line
and Cockatoo Dock, or from far more pros-
perous enterprises, lias never occurred to
anyone. When all industries are national-
ised, this exemption from taxes is certain
to apply. Then the Government which
makes a monopoly of “distribution and ex-
change” will have to dig its customs revenue,
to say nothing of its excise revenue, out of
its own pocket, or go without. The wily im-
porter, who knows all the tricks of the trade,
has an occasional difficulty in finding the
customs money, and a mob of amateurs,
armed mainly with the lore of Karl Marx
(properly Mordecai), will certainly find
more. That explains why, among other
things, the railways of Russia fell to pieces,
why no new machinery was built, why mines
were undeveloped and why poverty and
starvation came to the land.
* * * *
As for the rank and file which doesn't
share the loaves and fishes of office (because
no system can furnish enough of these to
go round), nationalisation is likely to be
undiluted disappointment. The ranker, as
things go in Australia, is a full-share owner
of 25,000 miles of railway, 8500 post offices
(some of them palatial), thousands of bank-
ing establishments, nearly 1,800,000,000 acres
of public land ; also ships, docks, trams, and
other assets galore. Yet if he wants to sell
his share in one of these he can’t sell. If he
wants, to raise the most trifling loan on his
share, he can’t do it. If he wants to camp
on his share of a railway line or a post-office
or bank verandah, he is no more allowed to
do it than if he owned nothing. If he leaves
the country he has to abandon all his nation-
alised riches and go forth naked, save for
any scrap of private property which he may
have saved out of the welter of nationalisa-
tion. And if lie was part owner of all
nationalised Australia and its nationalised
contents, he would be up against the same
limitations in the fullest sense. Communism,
where it has established itself, has, however,
proved a highly payable business for the
principal office-holders, and a fairly good one
for their satellites. They have dug them-
selves in, because they have no use for a
rotary system by which each Bolshevik’s turn
of greatness might be one day in a century.
* * * *
The Bulletin is quite prepared to be-
lieve that Matthew Charlton and most of
his lieutenants do not believe in the Com-
munistic platform on which they stand. It
is even prepared to believe that a good many
of them don’t know what that, platform really
is. It is quite likely that, without thinking
much about it, they have permitted various
planks to be inserted purely for vote-catching
purposes. So far as they are concerned
the goods in the window are not for sale —
they are merely to get a few more people in-
side. But those people, having been got in-
side, will at least have to be kept quiet. So
at the best we shall have a succession of sops
thrown to them —the sort of sop that Gillies
has had to throw in Queensland and that
Lang is beginning to throw in N. S. Wales.
The public has to make up its mind before
polling-day whether that sort of thing—•
which is the best we can look for under
Charlton’s rule —isn’t likely to be just
about as disastrous as straight-out Com-
munism.

MAY 30 AND NOVEMBER 14.
T. J. Ley, who was Minister of Justice in
the late N.S.W. Fuller Government and first
favorite for the party leadership till he with-
drew his candidature, has heartened the
managers of the Federal Nationalists’ cam-
paign by resigning from the Leg. Assembly
to contest the Barton seat in the House of
Reps. Australia has known few politicians
who would have done the like, for under the
silly State electoral law Ley will have no
chance of returning to the Assembly via a
by-election if beaten next month ; moreover,
the Labor majority in Barton three years
ago was 8521. The Nationalists in particu-
lar have hitherto been short of men willing
to take a chance for the cause; and by one
of those coincidences which strike the dullest
imagination, this Nationalist sent in his
papers while his ignoble Labor opponents
were putting through a salary steal—£44s
to £495 p.a. more for Ministers and £275
p.a. extra for each Assemblyman not holding
office, all dated back to July I—of which no
warning was given to the plundered electors
during the May campaign.
Still it should not be thought for one
moment that Ley has quixotically rushed
into a hopeless fight. On State-election
figures his prospects are good. Barton is a
smaller edition of the State electorate of St.
George. In that electorate four months ago
Ley got 16,171 primaries, and there was
only a difference of five votes between the
Nationalist and Labor totals —30,357 against
50,362. Yet the Nationalists were handi-
capped by at least two weak candidates, and
St. George contains some Labor strongholds
which are not in Barton. The subjoined,
figures, taking primaries only, show how the
Barton subdivisions voted for the Federal
parties in 1922 and for the corresponding
State parties in 1925:—-

Totals.. .. 8949 12,285 17,382 16,949
In Barton the Labor man secured 1064
postal and absent votes and the Nationalist
879. In St. George 1570 postal and absent
votes were distributed among the National-
ists and 1157 among the Labor candidates.
Ley polled 9154 primaries in the Barton
subdivisions. Gosling, his principal Labor
opponent, received 9039. Between Decem-
ber 16, 1922, and May 30, 1925, the elec-
toral population increased greatly in parts
of the district, round about Hurstville espe-
cially ; and 73.29 p.c. of the electors voted in
St. George, as against 56.84 p.c. in Barton.
Another factor in the situation is that Ley
has a local popularity and a talent for elec-
tioneering which the last National candi-
date for Barton did not possess; on the other
hand, McDonald, the Labor nominee who
unexpectedly defeated Lamonb, has proved
a dud in politics, though amiable enough.
At all events, if the party voting on May
30 is repeated on November 14, Labor will
lose the Barton seat. And the same is
true of other N.S.W. electorates, Gwydir in
particular. Three years ago the “socialisa-
tion” crowd polled 1753 fewer primaries in
Gwydir than its opponents, but owing to
the feud then raging between the National-
ists and the Cockies, Cunningham, another
Parliamentary dud, got enough preferences
to scrape in by 37 votes. A comparison of
1922 and 1925 voting in some of the subdi-
visions shows that the party with the Bed
objective (and the yellow streak as regards
strikes) has improved its position, though
not by much :

Clearly if the local Nationalists and Cockies
pull together, as Bruce and Page have been
doing since February, 1923, one of their
candidates —probably the Country-party man
—will dispose of Cunningham.
* * * *
The Charlton party had 29 seats (out of
75) in the late House of Heps., 13 (out of
28) being N. S. Wales seats. Before it can
take office with an assured majority on the
floor of the House it will need 10 more
seats at the least, and a gain of 10 seats in
Victoria, Queensland, S. Aus., Westralia and
the Speck is out of the question. While a
slight accession of strength is possible in
Queensland (10 seats) and Westralia (five
seats), none can be expected from Tasmania
(five seats) or S. Aus., where four of the
seven electorates returned Labor members in
1922 and the margin between the parties is
generally small: and the question in Victoria
(20 seats), where Ballarat and Wannon
were won by very narrow majorities, is
whether the party which has gone to Moscow
for the leading items of its policy can hold
what it has had since 1922. Therefore N. S.
Wales will decide whether or not Australia
is to have another Government of the Lang
and Gillies Variety, with multiplied powers
and opportunities.. Those who would capture
the Commonwealth for Labor-Socialism and
the mob —there are already five State Labor-
Socialist Administrations in office, though
the mob is in power when a strike is called
—will require to gain at least five elector-
ates in N. S. Wales. If State-election figures
are any criterion the feat is beyond them.
The figures in question suggest, indeed, that
it will go hard with McDonald in Barton,
Moloney in Hume, Lazzarini in Werriwa,
and Coleman in Reid. The Federal elec-
toral distribution is not nearly so kind to
Labor-Socialism as the weird arrangement
which enabled it to win 46 N.S.W. Assem-
bly seats out of 90 with 410,478 effective
votes out of 855,857.
* * * *
Also, conditions have changed since May
30, and not in Labor’s favor. There was
bad blood then between the State National-
ists and Cockies, whereas the Federal Na-
tionalists and Cockies have been in alliance
for two years and eight months, and cir-
cumstances have brought them even closer
together. In the course of four months the
N.S.W. Labor Government has greedily
raised its own salaries,' extended the local-
government franchise to nomads—violating
in each case a pre-election pledge—set up a
political reign of terror in the Public Ser-
vice, and cheekily defied the Commonwealth
Government in the matter of Walsh and
Joiianson ; and the Queensland Labor
Government has bought a cowardly truce
with strikers who had held up the whole
Government railway system and interdicted
the delivery of perishable produce and the
Commonwealth mails, a peace involving the
deliberate repudiation of private industrial
contracts and terrific taxation of the strike
victims. Moreover, it has been plainly
shown that any destructive fool or knave
who calls himself a unionist —even a blatant
Dutchman in the strike-promoting business
—is more to the less-Labor party than the
whole body of farmers for whose vote it
angles so assiduously at election-time. These
things are going to make a difference on
November 14. A big difference.

MAN AND THE MACHINE.
One of the Greek philosophers foresaw a day
when machinery was to entirely eliminate
the slave and leave the world to the master
and the forces under his control. To a
Greek, in a world built upon slavery, the
slave, apart from his service, was not worth
considering: lie was merely a crude arrange-
ment for doing work, and once the mechani-
cal contrivances took his place he did not
need to exist at all. But in the crumbling
ruins of ancient civilisation which took so
long to fall, the slave was not brushed aside.
It was indeed the slave element in the popu-
lation that made the fall complete; and the
arrival of a higher and more perfect machinery
of life was indefinitely postponed by the fact
that the slaves became the masters through
sheer superiority of numbers. Just as the
far-sighted Greek philosopher missed taking
account of the destroying elements which
were to prevent the steady progress of his
own civilisation, so those who trust to the
general lifting of the masses of people tainted
with the old serf spirit to the level of the
freemen masters of the world may miss the
probabilities of human progress taking an
altogether different direction. In a word, the
Greek guess that missed in the old civilisa-
tion might prove to be the correct guess in
the new civilisation where all are free but
all are not equally useful.
Seen from a certain point, present-day de-
velopments represent a struggle between
mankind and the machine; and the senti-
ment of the world is all in favor of a win
for mankind. That men are masters of the
machine does not alter the nature of the
fight ; for the men who are masters are really
few—-fewer in plain fact than the Greek
masters m a world of slaves —and the mass
of mankind is in no way in command. Tens
of thousands who use mechanical devices
know very little of their principles. Millions,
by touching an electric button, may turn on
power or light, but without the master-
minds behind the electric scheme which the
button operates that light or power could
not be under control for a moment. Very
rapidly the details of the old Greek dream
are being worked out in modern life. The
wonders of wireless are yet in their earliest
infancy. A scientist has foretold the not-
distant day when ships with full cargoes
may be sent to sea without crews, the whole
business of directing and working the vessel
being conducted by wireless from the shore.
If such an application of natural force over
broad oceans is within the range of possi-
bility, it is clear that countless operations
of the factory, the field and the home may be
performed in a similar way. More and more
the complex actions of civilisation are likely
to be rendered free from the need of human
hands; and though the number of masters
ot the machine must grow, it is difficult to
see what place will be filled by those who
are not masters.
* * * *
All such theory has an inhuman appear-
ance m the light of modern ideas about the
brotherhood of man; but how far is such
brotherhood a mere convention? It cer-
tainly did not enter the thought of ancient
civilised peoples, whose thinking was in many
directions as logical as our own. Yet the
sentiment of the world is a big factor; and,
wisely guided, the race of man should get
somewhere near to universal mastery at the
same moment that the machine comes to full
power. There is a law of perfect balance
n i, these things. While men willingly and
effectively do all the work that the machine
might do, the machine is not called for.
The enormous and rapid increase of labor-
saving appliances in the home was the direct
result of the shortage of domestic servants;
the constant improvement in harvesting
machinery had its start when it was found
that the old method of reaping by hand was
wholly inadequate to cope with the wider
wheat-fields of modern agriculture; the pre-
sent-day constructional methods employed in
the larger buildings are almost wholly the out-
come of the shortage of skilled labor in the
building trades. In almost every trade hand-
labor is superior to any machine-labor if the
workmen give their best service. The spur
to the triumph of the machine is always the
doubtful workmanship and the unsettled
labor conditions. Thus the recent hold-up of
shipping between Australia and Britain is
the kind of event which makes for the
triumph of the machine. Whatever the
rights or wrongs of the seamen may be, the
fact that such a hold-up can take place has
already stimulated a thousand inventive
minds to devise means by which such disloca-
tion of communications can be minimised in
the future. It may still be a far cry to the
ship wholly manned by electricity and navi-
gated by wireless from the shore; but it is
not a far cry to scores of devices which will
gradually reduce the crews required to a
few experts. No labor warfare can be waged
effectively against the machine once it
exists; but labor disturbances can easily
bring the machine into being, and the struggle
between labor and capital is a merely momen-
tary affair compared with the struggle be-
tween the controlled natural force repre-
sented by machinery and the man with strong
arms and a minimum of skill. The machine
is capable of breaking all human freedom,
except that of the masters of the machine,
just as surely as the rabble of liberated
slaves broke all the higher endeavor when
ancient civilisation fell; on the other hand,
there is no reason why the machine should
not be the means of a wider freedom and be-
come a thing only of good;. But every break in
the continuity of labor disturbs the balance
between the economic interests of the work-
ers and the progress of labor-curtailing in-
vention ; every such disturbance weakens the
labor position ; and if the disturbance is too
great and the progress of mechanical inven-
tion too rapid, the bulk of the workers must
find themselves under the wheels.

THE TWILIGHT HOMES OF
MELBOURNE.
Reliable information regarding some of the
Victorian institutions which titularly profess
to be “homes” for the indigent aged and in-
iirrn points insistently to the need for drastic
overhauling of the whole system under which
they are allowed to carry on. These insti-
tutions derive large incomes from subscrip-
tions. legacies and donations, in addition to
substantial annual grants from the State
and weekly payments from all inmates re-
ceiving old-age or invalid pensions ; and the
Charities Board, a Government body brought
into being some three years ago for the ex-
press purpose of exercising control over the
various philanthropic activities in the (state
which are thus supported, has not yet proved
equal to the task so far as regards the treat-
ment of inmates —the people for whose bone-
lit the money is provided. The Board lias
achieved good results in regularising the
affairs of the public hospitals throughout
the State—no small undertaking, seeing that
in the past these indispensable establish-
ments were left to carry on how they could
on their own. But what may be termed the
second line of charitable institutions those
that do not rank as hospitals proper—-re-
main to be thoroughly investigated and set
in order. And the need for radical reforms
in this field is imperative.
In and around Melbourne are a number
of these institutions, housing in the aggre-
gate many hundreds of helpless paupers of
both sexes, which’, though supported by public
money, are owned and managed entirely by
private committees; and it is in connection
with some of the largest of these establish-
ments that wide scope exists for fundamen-
tal improvement in the conditions in which
the inmates drag out tlieir closing years. In
one of these places, which poses before the
public as an old folks’ home, morons, syphil-
itics, mental deficients, victims of shell-
shock, confirmed sots and even able-bodied
inebriates may be found; and all the iu-
roates are herded together, the fit with the
unfit, the decent old people with the lowest
drunken outcasts, scalawags and gaolbirds.
Further, the inebriates are free to go out
and obtain alcohol, often methylated spirits,
with the result that they return to the in-
stitution in a state that may be imagined,
primed to insult and even assault any person
unfortunate enough to be in their way.
Should any victim of such blackguardism
complain to the management, he or she
(the sufferer may be of either sex') will be
curtly informed that if an inmate is dissatis-
fied with the conditions, there is no barrier
in the way of quitting the institution. Any
place less like a “home” for decent old folk
could nowhere be found. Plainly it is no-
thing more than a dumping-place for hope-
less inebriates and other human dregs with
whom even the police refuse to be further
troubled. The food served to the inmates,
besides being meagre in quantity and poor
in quality, is carelessly prepared and gen-
erally badly cooked, often quite uneatable.
The main meat dish is an unsavory stew, in
most cases allowed to get cold on the plat-
ters before being served. A dark and dirty
shed in a back, yard does duty as a common-
room for a hundred or more did men ; while
the old women have no sitting-room of any
kind. Yet there is a large hall kept empty
and only used for occasional entertainments
and Sunday services. The, managing body
of this institution complacently takes credit
to itself for running the establishment
cheaply on pauper labor by employing as
cleaners, etc., the more able-bodied of. the
inmates, nearly all confirmed inebriates
(who, of course, have no right to be in the
place at all) ; and these “workers” receive
pay of a few shillings a week. Their service
is necessarily intermittent owing to the ten-
dency irresistible with them to make off to
the nearest pub when they hold the price
of a drink. Despite that they often come
back to the institution in a condition of
howling intoxication, they are freely re-
admitted for the sake of the cheap labor
that can be got out of them when they have
been sobered up.
Perhaps Melbourne, indifferent as it is as
a community to the conditions prevailing
in its pauper institutions, would rear up
in indignant astonishment if such facts as
here set down were brought home to it. But
it is content to accept without question the
self-commending reports and statements of
the managing committees and responsible
officials of these establishments. And Mel-
bourne daily journalism studiously avoids
directing attention to dirty puddles which
are not conspicuous to the public eye. The
immured paupers never come under public
notice, and they are barred from uttering
any complaint. So the prosperous citizen
pays liis customary subscription without
troubling to inquire if the money thus pro-
vided is really devoted primarily and prin-
cipally to rendering the declining days of
the destitute and friendless aged as comfort-
able as possible. Satisfied that he is doing
his duty to the poor and unfortunate by this
voluntary payment, the worthy subscriber
puts away his cheque-book and dismisses the
matter from his mind, remaining blissfully
unconscious that the convenience and com-
fort of the inmates —the only substantial
purpose of an institution claiming to be
benevolent —is the last and smallest con-
sideration with the managing body of most
of the so-called “charitable” institutions of
Melbourne.
TEMSEE.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Dry Rot of Royal Commissions.
The art of creating a Royal Commission is
to find, say, three men who are available*
because they are unemployed. They are set
to take evidence (and as a rule they haven’t
any idea how to take evidence) on some sub-
ject of which they generally have no more
knowledge than the next man, and they are
remunerated by Ibc day to induce them to
kefp, going till their report is of no value.
In the struggle to demonstrate the possession
of the judicial mind, which they haven’t got
and which they are too old to acquire, the ,
Commissioners have a crazed tendency to
decide both ways or no way at all. This is
what the Royal Commission on the bogus
grievances of Wcstralia under Federation
has done. Its three members, Higgs, Ext-
wistle and Miles, hereinafter called A.,
B. and C. for short, produced these results
among others: —
A. and B. recommend that, for 25 years or longer,
Westralia should be allowed to make its own customs
and excise tariff, and thus be a single woman though
married and supported by her husband. But it is not
to favor outsiders and enemies as against the Com-
monwealth States. Presumably the Commonwealth is
to have a similar tariff against Westralia, otherwise
that State, whose Federal politicians howl bitteily for
Freetrade now, might - go Freetrade, and set up as. a
distributing centre for cheap imported goods and nig-
ger goods all over the Eastern States. Commissioner
C. said this silly idea of A. and B. was highly
undesirable.”
B. and C. couldn’t see that Westralia should be
compensated because the Commonwealth Savings Ban.,
competed with its local bank the same as with those
of other States. A. proposed that the Common-
wealth should withdraw its bank from Westralia,
but failed to say why it shouldn’t withdraw from other
States as well.
A., B. and C. agreed that the Westralian Govern-
ment should not be paid, by its neighbors, £3,000,000
because its gold-mining shareholders, mostly situated
out of Westralia, are said to have made losses owing
to the 1 ederal Government’s gold-purchase policy
during the war. A vague cadge for £2,600,000 was
also rejected.
Commissioner A. advised that Westralia should be
paid by its neighbors, for the next 10 years, a
bonus of 10s. per ounce on new gold produced.
Why it shouldn’t pay its own bonus, as Queensland
does in the case of Mount Morgan, or why other
States and other minerals shouldn’t be bonused, he
didn’t relate.
A. and B. recommended that, until Westralia
sets up its own customs and excise tariff against
its neighbors, the said neighbors should pay it a
bonus of £450,000 per annum, over and above
the ordinary Federal grant of so much per head.
C. suggested £300,000 a for 10 years, to be
dated back a year so that the first payment will be
already overdue, the bonus to be capable of indefi-
nite renewal. The whole three explained that
they had heard capital was being frightened away
from Westralia by the burden of taxation, caused
more or less allegedly by the deficit, said deficit
being caused more or less allegedly by Federation.
They failed to notice, not being noticeable men, that
during the last 10 years of deficit which are covered
by the published returns, Westralia taxed its people
less per head than any of its neighbors less ev en
than the poorest,
A, and B. thought the Inter-State Commission
should be revived, the members having long appoint-
ments and pension rights up to £IOOO per annum.
Possibly A. and B. could be induced to serve, and
even C. might oblige. B. advised that Federal
arbitration should be restricted to the all-Austialian
industries of shipping and Shearing. A. and B.
urged that the coastal provisions of the Navigation
Act should be repealed. They w<Jre further of opinion
that Westralia should be permuted, for 25 years,
to pay bounties on the production and export of
its own goods, subject to review by the Inter-State
Commission. Clause 91 of the Constitution pi o\ ides
that a State may grant “any aid to or bounty on
the production or export of goodsfc” provided it is
willing to pay. It must first get a simple resolution
through the two Federal Houses, Shut there is no
reason to suppose they would refuse if asked. A
certain reluctance on the part of tit? States to paj
may explain why the Federal Houses are not much
asked. The granting of bounties on minerals re-
quires no Federal authority.
Commissioner A. apparently stood in advo-
cating that Westralia north of latitude 26 should
be constituted a new State with a part-nominee part-
elective Government to begin with. She folly of
B. and C. in standing aloof from this wise idea
calls for the anathema at subsequent generations,
B. said that Westralia should never (have joined
the Commonwealth, and he might have \added that
Adam shouldn’t have fallen. He secession
the right thing, but didn’t clearly say whether the
seceding State should take with it its share of the
Federal debt and of the transcontinental railway
deficit, or leave them and be an absconding bankrupt.
The’ report commented, apparently on the joint
authority of A., B. and C., on the drift of Westralia’s
population to the other States, apparently regarding
this as cause for commiseration and compensation.
| The wandering to abssrd conclusions of C om-
missioners who can’t analyse evidence and who
drift in a dismasted condition bpfore the
wind of hearsay might be commented .on also.]
Taking the first three quinquennial periods of
Federation (1901-05, 1906-10 and 1910-15)4 Victoria
was a loser of population in one period. Queensland
in one, South Australia in two, and Tasmania m
all three, while Westralia under FederaticW was a
large winner all the time. During this perijpd West-
ralia gained 65,190 people by excels of arrivals over
departures, while the other five States among them
gained only 57,895. Taking 1021 as tifc year
when the departure and return of soldiers had
ceased to affect the returns. Westralia beflame a
consistent gainer again, while Tasmania, isolated
by chronic marine strikes, resumed its old ifle ot
a disastrous loser. When the typical politician of
Westralia, which has its BlolshevSks, bursts into mo«
tears than usual, the inference seems to be that he
has made it big profit out of somebody and is anxi-
ously disguising the fact.
Even the kind of Commission which is made
up of A., B. and C. might do a little it its
report waff strictly limited to decisions which
had been arrived at unanimously or by a
majority, and if minority reports were burned
unread. But even then it would seldom do
enough, let alone do enough? fast enough, to
make it: worth house room. The best sort
of Commission consists of a. judge ( not the
petty-court variety), or tlirpe judges it the
matter is so large and controversial as to
call for three. The demand as for men who
know what is law, what iff evidence, and
what is relevant to the matter in hand as
against what is padding or blank imperti-
nence. r i'he demand is also fdr men who are
not paidl by space, and who have( the habit
of command, and the authority (they should
bring it w&h them firom their ordinary
courts) to dleal with elteeky barristers and
with soljcitolrs who have a tendency to be
too “frefsh.” It would be economy to keep
the necessary supply of professional judges
on hand, for amateurs are costly, besides
being ntext dbor, or tin* same door, to use-
less. Possibly, too, the* demaml for Royal
Commissions W’ould diminish when the thing
became less like an untifly picnic and more
like s*ern business.
'iflic Right to Work.
The Labor party used to be keen on what
it called tie Right to Work. Nowadays
the phrase is rarely heard, but the principle
remains, although its application is ruth-
lessly rest (peted. According to the new
Laborism, the Right to Work is limited to
trade-unionists, who are in a minority of the
people, but is not absolute even then. For
instance, members of one union may not
handle material or toil on a job which has
been declared “black” (even capriciously or
malevolently) by the bosses of another
union. Union postmen in the Commonwealth
Government service may not take delivery of
mails held up by union railway men on strike
against a State Government, nor may union
seamen accept billets in a Commonwealth
Government steamer if some Dutch or
“pommy” union official declare that he has
reserved the said billets for his own pals, or
that the steamer will be tied up to expedite
the Revolution. As for farmers and the like,
it is not even conceded that they are entitled
to remove perishables from .Government
steamers or railway sidings in time of
strikes; and non-unionists, who used to be
tolerated even in places like Kalgoorlie and
Broken Hill, are regarded as having no
industrial rights whatever. The idea of any
worker being independent of the union boss
is so hateful to the new Laborism that even
Government and municipal employees arc
now commanded to join some union or other
or get out of their jobs. And that means
in many instances that these enforced union-
ists, though they may be supporters of the
Nationalist or Country party, will have to
pay A.L.P. contributions and levies and sub-
scriptions to some semi-Communist paper.
In the case of Sydney municipal officers it
may mean compulsory purchase of so-called
Labor bonds bearing no rate of interest or
guarantee of repayment. Of late the Labor
aldermen, who are in the majority in the City
Council, though representing a minority of
voters, have been active in the pursuit of
officers who, in the matter of Labor. union-
ism, have dared to call their souls their own.
Following on a resolution that "on Sep-
tember 1, 1925, all employees of the Sydney
Municipal Council other than the Town
Clerk, heads of departments and deputy-
heads of departments shall belong to and be
financial members of a union” (the Town
Clerk, now an unpaid union treasurer, is to
see that the unionists are “financial”), G.
H. Mason, a tester in the Electricity De-
partment, was ordered to join the Municipal
Employees’ Union, membership of which in-
volves financial contributions to the Labor
party. Declining, on the ground that he
belonged to another political party, Mason
was summarily dismissed with the loss of all
privileges and concessions—-in his case nearly
six months’ leave of absence on full pay
and a retiring allowance of two weeks’ pay
for every year of service, 15 years alto-
gether. The victim of political savagery is
described as “an efficient and reliable man
who has never given any cause for complaint
as to the manner in which he has carried
out his responsible duties.” This descrip-
tion of Mason has not been disputed by
his persecutors, and it may be instructively
compared with what a Royal Commissioner
recently said of Alderman Burke, who,
being chairman of the Municipal Labor
party (and senior M.L.A. for Sydney), may
be described as chief persecutor: —
There was a proposal corruptly to obtain money
from the Country Producers’ Selling Co., Ltd., regard-
ing the re-grading of Buhvarra-road. There was an
attempt at interference with the purity of municipal
administration. The persons connected therewith were
Alderman Burke and Mr. Pahnham. An alderman
receives no remuneration for his services. At the
time in question Alderman Burke was a com-
mission-agent. His business was a small one. He
kept no books and he had no bank account, iie
had no office and he carried on his business from
his home and the Town Hall. In his evidence he
said: “I devote pretty well most of my time to my
municipal duties as chairman of my party.” In
the evidence given by Mr. P uiniiam it was stated
that Alderman Burke said that, as he was chair-
man of the works committee and had three followers,
for an amount of four “fifties” this regrading
could be done to suit the company’s store —£100
to be paid at the start and £IOO on completion of
the work.... In detailing the circumstances sur-
rounding the meeting, Alderman Burke makes a false,
statement about what takes place at the beginning
and a false statement about what takes place at
the end. I find that Alderman Burke did offer to
accept four “fifties” and that such corrupt pro-
posal was in response to an invitation by Mr. Parx-
ham.
Those remarks have been ignored by the
party which has dismissed “an efficient and
reliable” municipal employee because of his
opinions, and Alderman Burke remains
one of its shining ornaments. It lias even
been suggested that he may be the next Lud
Mayor.
Compulsory Communism.
Dear Bulletin. —The new political variety
of trades unionism in Australia is
approaching 10 years old. In 1914 the
Federal Labor party went to the country
as a strenuously patriotic organisation
which proposed to prosecute the Great \\ ar
of freedom against the military tyrants of
Central Europe to the bitter end, and won.
In 1917 it went to the country as a change-
ling creature which had gone over, or was
going over, to the side of the military tyrants,
and then it lost. Somewhere between these
dates the existing type of Australian union-
ism took shape, and it has been developing
over since. In its present form it seems
an institution which has outlived its use-
fulness, after the manner of the feudal
system and other vanished concerns, and
tiie question begins to be asked whether it
is a separate institution at all. or is now
simply a subordinate branch of Communism.
It has become much more political than
industrial, and its politics are foreign and
diseased, while its industrial side is devoted
so entirely to the stoppage or diminution of
industry that no room is left for anything
else. In N.S.W., where the new political union-
ism'is in the most advanced state of bloom,
unionism has been made compulsory, and
is being enforced in Government and muni-
cipal circles by sack, ostracism and savage
victimisation. ‘ A recent development, quite
an ordinary thing of its kind, was the dis-
charge of a Sydney municipal employee with
a good record of 15 years’ service, and the
forfeiture of his accumulated rights and
privileges, for refusal to be a compulsory
unionist. To be one has practically come
to mean being a compulsory Communist, by
profession at least, for the dexterous Com-
munist element runs the industrial show’,
and has a short way with those suspected of
not shouting w’hole-heartedly for Moscowism.
Membership of the union means compulsorv
support of near-Commuuist papers which
are unfortunately unable to support them-
selves. It also involves strict limitation of
earnings by reason of the strict limitation
of work done, the fines for any suspicion of
more than the minimum of energy being
heavy. This carries with it strict limita-
tion/ if not total abolition, of any prospect
of better tilings unless the unionist cau leave
off work and take to politics or fraud. With
arbitration courts to attend to wage quos-
tions, the political stop-work, stop-wage
variety of unionism offers nothing but draw-
backs to the member, but it flourishes by its
capacity for offering a great many more
drawbacks to the non-member. Au em-
bittered Victorian miner, who wisely used a
pen-name, recently sent his list of contribu-
tions to the press, stating that complaint
at a union meeting, where the extremists
always arrived early and in full force, was
unsafe. Some items were :
Contribution, 35.. Oil.; sick and benefit, Is.; levy
for hall, 25,; levy for victimised member, Is. ; band,
fid.; federation levy, 1J per cent. ; seamen’s levy,
li Per cent.; death levy, lj per cent.
For some of these items the only return
was the promise of a share in the future
Communist heaven, and the persecuting
Mohammedan similarly promises the forced
convert a bit of his paradise. As the com-
pulsory and contributing Christian has no
faith in his paradise he is naturally irritated,
but he often conforms for the hour because
it is better to be irritated than dead. Seeing
that conscripted Bolshevik unionism is its
own sole reward, and a very disagreeable and
cantankerous reward at that, it may yet
meet the sudden fall of these who overdo
things. In other words, it may lead to the
uprising of a terrace of Governments which
will abolish preference to unionists, make
fines aud strike levies irrecoverable at law,
prohibit the expulsion or suspension of a
unionist except on the verdict of a jury, do
a generous deportation of undesirable aliens,
and suspend the corporation of Sydjney,
replacing it by a board of commissioners, as
happened once before. When the worm turns
in real earnest lie may pull down forests in
his wrath. —Yours, James Ed.moxo.

Watery Humor.
It is not often that the painful process or
extracting rates and taxes is relieved by the
anaesthesia of subtle humor. The Sydney
Water and Sewerage Board is trying the
experiment. Enclosed with its formal de-
mand for rates, the Board is sending out
a little leaflet headed “Important —Please
read.” Its importance commands this notice.
When a citizen, or more probably his wife,
interviews the grocer and purchases a pound
of tea, she gets her pound of pekoe and pays
for what she gets. She doesn't pay for a
pound and get seven ounces. That is the
ordinary course of trading—you pay for what
you get and get what you pay for. But that is
exactly what you don’t get with the Water and
Sewerage Board. Let us suppose that, de-
spite the discouragement of Labor legisla
tion, you have accumulated sufficient money
to buy a house. The Valuer-General will
send one of his young gentlemen to east a
superior eye on your tenement. Then he
values you. The first feeling of the young
and inexperienced may be one of grateful
appreciation. But even youth learns—when
it has to pay. A little later on the Water
and Sewerage Board will send in its little
account. Having, say, only a wife, a baby
and about four yards square of lawn and
garden, your needs in the way of water
are not great; and, in any ease, listening to
the Board's frequent appeals, you perhaps
economise in its use. What, then, is your
surprise to learn from this account that you
have to pay for almost countless gallons of
water you can never by any luxury of baths,
sprinklers and water-distributing contrap-
tions possibly consume! If you ask “Why?”
you will be told that you pay not on actual
use but on valuation. Your property is by
the ingenious fictions in which the Valuer-
General deals valued at so much. On that
much you pay. What would you say to
your grocer for having the impudence to de-
clare that you must pay for a pound of tea
though you had been supplied with only
seven ounces—because, forsooth, you had a
nice little “crib” or a pretty little bungalow?
But it is no use saying it —whatever it might
he —to the Water Board. That body would
only smile because you were so dense as not
to see the humor of it. The pamphlet “Im-
portant” 'contains some other witticisms.
With an air of smug piety it refers to the
“recent bountiful rains” —one would expect
“0 Loan!” to follow —and calls attention
to its kindly consideration for the citizen
in so adjusting its rates that now. instead
of having to pay on six months’ hypothe-
tical water in advance, lie will have to pay
on 12 months of such dream water; hut —•
and this is really exquisite—lie will he
allowed a reasonable time in which to pay!
The cream of the precious leaflet lies, how-
ever, in the request of the Board for the
co-operation of its victims in avoiding waste
of water. This proposition put grocer-wise
would read thus: “Yes. Mum, my union re-
quires me to charge you for a pound of tea
when you use only seven ounces; all the
same, I’d be very much obliged if you could
see your way to cut down tin l amount to five
ounces. It’d save my stock ever so.” In
sober earnest, can the Board expect citizens
to be economical of water and at the same
time acquiesce in being charged, on a purely
fictional basis, for quantities they have never
used, are never likely to use, and, in many
instances, could not use if they let all their
taps run all night and all day? When the
Board changes its method and urges an
amendment of the Act under which it
operates, thus enabling it to trade honestly
by demanding payment only for what is used,
just as gas and electric-current suppliers
have to. then it may expect economy in the
use. Meantime, reckless use of water is
bound to continue.

Australia’s Naval College.
From the father of one of the boys, after a
visit to Jervis Bay:—
It was Saturday, and a Sydney college was playing
Rugby against the third- and fourth-year boys in
smiling sunshine, and the first- and second-year cherubs
were looking on and playing around. Fine as the
Sydney collegians were, the Navy boys stood out
like fine racehorses against good hunters. The effect
on the Navy hoys of the regular life, daily exorcise
and training showed up wonderfully, even in such a

The Hotel of the Commonwealth , Sydney.
SUMMER DAYS' IN SYDNEY
Enchanting things to do and see on every hand—sight-seeing, social
engagements, surfing. But do not miss the pleasure of a stay at "The
Australia." It is the hotel pre-eminent, of unchallenged excellence in
cuisine, service and appointments.
Cable, Wireless and Telegraphic Address: “Austraotel, Sydney.”
Single Room, with Breakfast, from 13/6; Luncheon or Dinner, from 4/-;
Light Luncheon in the Winter Garden, from 2/6.
If you anticipate coming, write for your copy of our beautifully-illustrated 20-page booklet.
crowd of athletes. A group of first-year boys (13
to 14 years of age) took me to their Saturday and
Wednesday afternoon playliut in the bush, rowing
ships’ boats up a sunlit lagoon for half a mile, and
then to their self-made camp, where they frolicked
and played and cooked their camp-fare—probably
filched from their messroom when No. 1 was not
looking. Then to sec their messroom, where about
50 boys have their meals, which are chosen with
simplicity and health as the only objectives. “Lucky
young devils!” was my only thought, and their quiet
confidence, efficiency and high spirits showed how
they appreciated it. After that to their wardroom,
sleeping quarters, library and billiard-room, where
surprise could not be restrained at their comfort.
Lastly, to the big school, with an education staff and
syllabus that would satisfy the most ambitious of
academical fathers. Science and seamanship have
the chief place after the grounding education and
the three “R's.” One could only regret that the
whole educational system of Australia was not founded
on this roster —even including the seamanship and
discipline.
Came Sunday, and we went to see the boys and the
sailors at church, and to hear their hearty singing
was good for one’s soul. The padre, too, knew his
boys and preached accordingly. Sunday afternoon
was spent in quiet cutter-sailing by the boys in the
lovely bay.
Fishing is fair to good. Tennis, golf, football,
boxing and cross-country running are included in
the week’s training, making an ideal life for anyone.
The moral make-up of the boy is watched closely,
and it is seen in plenty of time who will not be
eaual to the splendid moulding of character or
whose physical strength may not be equal to the
average, and representations are made accordingly to
the parents through the authorities.
One left the College with a feeling of pride that
there existed in Australia a place that would not be
shamed by the Naval College of Dartmouth. And one
wants to tell those parents who can to encourage their
boys to go into the Australian Navy. We are going
to depend on it one day r , and the finer the type of
cadet the surer we are of success. The cadet can
never regret his life at Jervis Bay, nor can the
parent regret giving up his son to such a service.
It was hard to find a point of criticism, but the
impression that cannot be obliterated is that it is
a waste of a golden opportunity that the fine material
in personnel, establishment and equipment cannot be
used by 500 of our Australian lads instead of about
50, as under the present Treasury arrangement for the
Royal Australian Navy.
The recent interehange-of-officers agreement between
Britain and Australia widens the scope of the Aus-
tralian Navy vastly, and it is hoped that something
can now be done by legislation in order than an in-
creasing number of stalwart young Australians can
take a part in the Empire’s Navy. What a fine outlook
—Empire’s Navy—rather than the Commonwealth
Navy with its limited scope and outlook!
Malaria Moves South.
That malaria is slowly moving southward
along the eastern seaboard is more than sug-
gested by tlie recent discovery of a case ol
the purely endemic type of the disease in the
neighborhood of Newcastle. The patient was
a young man aged 22 who had lived all liis
life in that part of the State, and had not
been out of the district for a day during the
preceding four years. The onset of the
disease was exactly the same as it is in the
recognised malarial areas, with the difference
that most of the symptoms were much milder.
A careful inquiry failed to disclose the pres-
ence of any other malarial sufferer in the
vicinity who might have acted as the host.
But tiie patient’s home was in a marshy
area, and there does not seem to be any
doubt that he was infected by one of the
anopheline mosquitoes which breed by the
million in such places, and which in its turn
had been infected from some other case.
During the last four or five years there has
been a series of infections of a similar nature
right along the N.S.W. coast, and the focus
of the disease has been steadily creeping
closer to Sydney. If nothing more is done
to check its advance it is not unlikely that
two or three more decades will see Sydney a
definitely malarial ai’ea, which would be a
national catastrophe. The trouble is that
some of these potential breeding-grounds are
under the control of municipal councils,
which are indifferent to the danger,, while
others are under the control of the State
Government, which, if anything, is more so.
Nevertheless a good deal could be done
through a persistent educational campaign,
just as has been done in the fight against
hookworm further north.
Dear Bulletin, —An anonymous corres-
pondent, commenting in a newspaper on a
par contributed to Tiie Bulletin by “Zeno”
(B. 21/5/'25), maintains that the Labor
Conference did right to condemn my action
in assisting the Broken Hill Proprietary
Co. to establish its steelworks at Newcastle.
He argues that “no Minister is justified in
assisting a private concern at the taxpayer’s
expense.” As a general principle 1 admit
the justice of the contention, but that is
just what I avoided doing. I certainly spent
£30,000 in dredging the channel to make it
possible for shipping to approach the co.’s
wharves, but the co. agreed to pay full inter-
est in perpetuity on this outlay. Also, the
sand pumped from the river-bed had to be
deposited somewhere, and the low-lying land
on the river bank (on which the steelworks
now stand) wgs quite the most convenient
place on which to pump it. Further, the
site was bisected by an abandoned colliery
railway embankment which the co. was un-
able to purchase except at a prohibitive
figure. This I resumed and handed over to
the co. on its repaying the Government the
full cost of the resumption. Also, to give
the co. a start, I placed with it a big order
for steel rails at the price at which I
was importing them from America. Under
these conditions it is not easy to follow the
contention that the assistance I gave the co.
was “at the expense of the taxpayers.” Even
if the co. had not agreed to pay interest on
the cost of dredging the channel I would
have been justified in doing it, on the
ground that it constitutes a permanent im-
provement to the port, and that one week’s
wages to the employees "would cover the
Avhole cost. —Yours, Arthur Griffith.

Lord Mayor Stokes, M.L.A., led a deputa-
tion of politicians, aldermen and councillors
from Southern Monaro and East Gippsland
into the presence of N.S.W. Minister for
Railways Flannery, requesting the co-
operation of the N.S.W. Government with
that of Victoria in the construction of a
railway from Eden to Orbost. Victorian
AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.
LITTLE BOY BURNHAM : "Gee, J.O., I didn't think u-o wore THAT big!”
Premier Allan has already expressed ap-
proval of the project, which would involve
87 miles of line in his State and only 8 miles
in N. S. Wales. It would open up the mag-
nificent closed port of Twofold Bay, into
which the Renown and the Repulse steamed
and anchored in 174 fathoms, and into which
the Brisbane steamed without slowing down.
The cookies of East Gippsland, who are
served with a series of dead-end lines radi-
ating from Melbourne, would be enabled
to pour their maize and beans into the
Sydney market. The 87 miles from Orbost
to the N.S.W. border, where the trees grow r
taller than anywhere on earth, would open
up some of the greatest timber tracts in
the continent. At least 100,000 acres of
volcanic soil equal to the 100-bushel brand
of the Orbost maize-growers would be brought
into production. The projected Bombala-
Eden line, now before the N.S.W. Public
Works Committee, would relieve Southern
Moiiaro of the weary drag over 350 miles of
railway to Sydney, 'and help -to build Eden
as old Ben Boyd thought it should be built.
All this impressed Minister Flannery, and
lie announced that lie would confer with
the Vie. Minister for Railways after further
study of the data. Then Lord Mayor Stokes
took fright. Before the deputation dispersed
he implored its units to reconsider their
demand. “Get your railway, by all means,”
he said. “But get it from Bombala or some
other inland point to Orbost. If Twofold
Bay is developed, it will injure the rest of
the railways—they won’t be able to compete
with the water carriage.”
*
“Huffin-Guffin” : Shop-assistants are not
the only people among whom efficiency has
shrunk and slackening in effort is observable
(B. 24/9/’25). These things are noticeable in
all callings. Probably the relatively higher
wages of the unskilled or semi-skilled have
a good deal to do with it. “Why should 1
bother about promotion and its increased
responsibility for a shilling or tw T o a day?”
says the lower-grade man. While the basic
wage has increased, in many cases, 100 per
cent., or more, that for the next grade above
it has not increased 50 per cent. When the
unions insisted on a “living wage” apparently
they did not foresee that it would make
skilled workmen scarcer. When I started
out as a wage-earner nearly 40 years ago I
received ss. a day. The top of my class of
worker drew 15s. a day. Now the ss. man
of my time gets 15s. and the top man 225.
Gd. I paid 18s. a week for board and lodging,
or, say, 31 days’ pay. Now the 15s. a day
man can get the same thing for 275. Gd., or
less than two days’ pay, which leaves so
much more for the pursuit of pleasure.
There is less interest and pride in one’s work,
and less concentration on the serious things
of life. It may be that when the aftermath
of the war has finally passed away, these
things will return. An ordinary war ‘dis-
turbs the national life for years. An extra-
ordinary one may do so for a generation.
None the less, it is discouraging to have it
continually dinned into our ears that‘we
are not as good as our fathers were. “Say
not thou, ‘What is the cause that the former
days were better than these?' For thou dost
not inquire wisely concerning this.’’ says the
Preacher (Ecclesiastes vii, 10).

“Jog” : Hartnoll, manager of Millaquin
mill refinery and plantation (N.Q.), has
been producing power-alcohol from molasses
for years past. He runs all the tractors on
the place with it; mixed with petrol it sup-
plies the power for his own motor-car. Some
adjustment of the carburetter is necessary,
but it is not eostlj'; it consists mainly in re-
placing the ordinary shellac float by jj, metal
one. Hartnoll says he could sell power-
alcohol at the same price as petrol; but under
present conditions that isn't good enough.
Millaquin also makes rum and methylated
spirits from molasses, but the market for each
is very limited, and the rest of the molasses
is allowed to run into the Burnett River.
Experimenting has been going on for years
to find a larger use for the waste material,
but it is difficult to hit on anything readily
marketable.
♦
“Borom” : Australia has never been enthusi-
astic concerning research work in the spheres
of science, and save for a few isolated work-
ers practically nothing has been done, with
the result that 99 per cent, of the additions
to our scientific and technical knowledge
come fi’om overseas. It is not hard to find
the reason, so far as the Universities are
concerned. Their staffs have no time to
spare from their ordinary duties of teaching
and examining, and most of them have no
available funds. Yet research in pure and
applied science is the measure of a country’s
industrial progress. It was research which
enabled Germany to build up her mighty
technological machine of pre-war days, just
as it is enabling America to create a great
nation at the present time. In the Common-
wealth there seems to be no use in putting
any faith in the prospect of Federal or State
Governments stimulating the prosecution of
research. For a time when W. M. Hughes
was Prime Minister there really did seem
to be some hope that something would be
done. An expensive and promising Institute
of Science and Industry was created, a series
of consultative committees was appointed,
and everything seemed ready for a start. But
that was nearly 10 years ago, and not a
single step forward has been made. The
extensive laboratories which were to have
been established at various points have not
materialised, and to-day the Institute con-
sists of a few officials and many dusty piles
of technical journals published in other coun-
tries. The wonder is that a stimulus has not
come from the business and commercial
world, which has most to gain by advances
made and most to lose by failure to keep
abreast of other countries. In both England
and America it is a poor University which
does not possess a Chair of Industrial Chem-
istry, with a varying number of subsidiary
chairs; in one English University recently
there was established a Department of Glass-
ma king, with a well-endowed professorship
and lectureship, and provision for at least
half a dozen research workers in that field.
Almost without exception ' the Universities
have been enabled to move in these direc-
tions because of monetary aid received from
the commercial world, not so much through
generosity as because it was a matter of cold
practical business to help in this way. Apart
from one or two poor scholarships and adzes,
nothing of the sort has ever been done here,
and at the present day there is not only no
University in which any provision is made
for industrial research, but none even partly
equipped for the teaching of the more special-
ised branches of technological science. See-
ing the hold that importing has in Australia,
it may be that this is the result of design
more than anything else. But it is none the
less disastrous on that account.
♦
'Analyst'’ : Despite a Health Department
regulation, many Sydney and Melbourne hair-
dressers persist in employing the, obnoxious
"styptic pencil” for checking the bleeding
from razor cuts. These pencils, which are
composed of ordinary alum because of its
astringent action, are frequently used on
several faces _in a day, so that a skin or
blood complaint may easily be passed on.
Sterilisation is not attempted, and. in any
case, it would be impossible. Yet it is just
as easy for the barber to use powdered alum,
which is much more efficacious in stopping
bleeding. One or two prosecutions might
have a salutary effect.
“X.N.0.” : An old naval pal. writing to me
a few days ago to announce his return to
Sydney, concluded with “We shall there-
fore expect you at 2000 on Tuesday.” When
will British countries adopt this very sen-
sible method of measuring the time o’ day?
It is done on the Continent, and the resultant
simplification of railway time-tables, etc..
makes it well worth while. Midnight is 0000.
Thirty-seven minutes past 9 a.m. is 0937, and
4.23 p.m. is 1623; 2000 is, therefore, 8 p.m.
The Navy discarded a.m. and p.m. many
years ago, and with it disappeared all pos-
sibility of doubt as to the exact time meant.
Even before the method was adopted in cor-
respondence and written orders, every mes-
sage sent by signal or wireless always con-
cluded with the “time of origin” expressed
in four figures. The advantages are so mani-
fest that it is extraordinary the system is not
in universal use.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Bruce-Page programme, as outlined
at Dandenong (Vic.) on Monday night, is
ambitious, at all events. Three conspicuous
items are national insurance against inva-
lidity, unemployment and old age ; £20,000,000
for road development, and a similar amount
for home-building, to be advanced through
the Commonwealth Bank. It is also proposed
to clothe the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court with power to enforce its own awards
and to get the Federal and State industrial
Judges to report on the child-endowment and
hours-of-labor questions with a view to
Australian-wide action; and unionists are
to be assisted, by provision for secret bal-
lots, to regain control of their unions—such
control as members of friendly societies exer-
cise. Further, “the Government stands for
the greatest measure of defence consistent
with the man-power and financial resources
of the nation” ; and its sketch of an army
consisting of seven divisions is a lot more
impressive than the Labor idea of a uni-
formed mob of the “class-conscious” order
which is to keep its weapons at home. And
the North-South railway hasn’t been for-
gotten, after all. The bill for the extension
to the line to Alice Springs is to be intro-
duced at “the earliest possible date.” The
promise could be more definite, but it is a
promise nevertheless, and Bruce, though no
heaven-born statesman, has shown himself a
man of his word.
Some papers are suggesting that the crowd
with the made-in-Moscow programme may
be licked for the House of Reps, and yet
secure a majority of Senators. That is, of
course, possible, but it is not at all likely,
unless non-Labor electors go in for such fan-
tastic- vote-splitting as enabled Westralian
Labor in 1922 to get two Senate seats out of
three with 29,755 primaries out of 71,746.
Senate polls were small everywhere three
years ago (only 46.71 p.c. in Westralia), and
the Nationalists and Coekies w r ere divided by
bitter animosities; this time voting will be
compulsory, and there wfill be Nat.-Cocky
Senate tickets in most if not all of the States.
The position is that there are 14 Senators
(out of 36) who don’t have to face the elec-
tors on November 14. Eight are Laborites
and five are Nationalists; the other is the
Tasmanian Ogden, who has shown that, he
has no use for Communism. If the Nat.-
< 'oekies can win the House of Reps, a differ-
ence of three seats (leaving Ogden out of
consideration) should not prevent them cap-
turing the Senate.
A capacity for mild astonishment is West-
ralian Premier Phil Collier’s long suit. Last
December, when the waterside insurrection
was so bad that Federal customs and medi-
cal officials were prevented from going
aboard ships at Fremantle, the Prime Minis-
ter asked him to do something for the main-
tenance of order. Collier felt called upon
to be justly indignant, not having heard of
any disorder. The hold-up has lasted an-
other nine months, and has grown so much
worse that British shipowners have decided
to omit Fremantle as a port of call, but
another appeal the other day found the local
potentate still justly indignant. Apparently
he still hasn’t heard anything.
When Saklatvala, British M.P. and
empire-wrecker, w r as shut out of the U.S.,
the simple rule w-as laid down that no ex-
traneous Communist should be allowed to
enter the republic, or to remain in it if
he had entered without detection. One
London daily urged Uncle Sam not to make
a “martyr” of Sak. and said that “gasbags”
of his sort should be treated with “pitying
indifference.” But extinct martyrs are soon
forgotten, whereas gasbags march on and
make converts, and the pitying indifference,
if not properly labelled, is apt to be mistaken
for pitiable indecision or even piffling incapa-
city.
A Sydney municipal official with a 15-
years’ good record was sacked the other day,
with forfeiture of
all his retiring
rights, because he
had failed to join
a union and make
himself responsible
for his share of
any levies which
might be made in
support of Labor-
papers, the British
seamen’s strike, or
the defence of T.
Walsh. The sack
notice told hi rn
that he might carry
his case to the
Town Clerk “whose
decision on the ap-
peal is final” : but
perhaps it might be
rather final for the
Town Clerk if be
gave an unaccept-
able decision.
T h e Grafton-
Kyogle - Brisbane
railway, which the
Federal Govern-
ment promised in
an hour of super-
fluous enthusiasm,
is already in
trouble. It is really
the business of the
two rich States
concerned, and a
duplicate railway
to Brisbane, though
desirable, is only
about 99th on the
list of urgent
works. It being a
struggle with
mountain country,
the cost was guessed
at £3,500,000, or
£40,000 per mile,
which would be
hopelessly unpay-
able ; but the best
tender is said to be
more likg £BO,OOO
per mile, which is
a vast deal worse.
The expectation of
unlimited strike
troubles during the
process of construc-
tion doesn’t make
for low tendering.
The Bruce-Page
Government would
be well-advised to
stick to its legitimate job, which is the South-
North railway through its own estate.
Vic. Treasurer Peacock intends to ask
Parliament to provide, him with an additional
£200,000 a year or thereabouts. Bruce took 124
p.c. off the Federal income-tax. Peacock will
put 10 p.c. on the State income-tax if Parlia-
ment will let him. Last year the Vic. income-
tax yielded £2,077,000, but that total included
a lot of arrears; the screw was applied to
get in the whole of the 1924-25 payments.
An appreciable falling-off is expected from
the impost this year unless rates are in-
creased. Extra mqney is needed to pay inter-
est on road, soldier-settlement and school-
building loans, for additional pay for
teachers and for the extra police recently
appointed. The Labor Government reduced
freights on agricultural products, causing a
loss of £155,000 for nine months, which the
Treasury had to make up. Now people with
incomes over £2OO a year have to be levied
on to continue the concession.
The N.SAV. Leg. Assembly, though it met
for the first time on August 12, already has
two nominee members, Minahan and Bagnall.
They were both badly beaten on May 30 —
Minahan got 2403 out of 35,107 first-prefer-
ence votes in Sydney and Bagnall 3979 out
of 63,639 in St. Georg<y-but the N.S.W.
electoral law provides in these cases for
thrusting members on constituencies which
have rejected them. And it grants constitu-
encies no power to dismiss such a member as
Kay, who, having been elected for North
Shore by Nationalists who thought he should
have been given a party nomination, has con-
sistently twisted—he even voted for the
salary grab. Were the recall in force North
Shore would soon settle Kay’s hash; but
N. S. Wales can’t have the recall, which
would be a real reform, while it has the
fraud called proportional representation.
After a sitting of 18 hours, Vic. Assembly
passed through committee the Allan-Peacock
Ministry’s bill continuing the voluntary wheat
pool for three years, with a Government
guarantee of 75 per cent, of values. Hogan,
Deputy Labor-leader, tried to have the bill
sidetracked with a view to forcing com-
pulsory pool legislation, but he was beaten
by two votes. Allan and Peacock knew the
margin would be narrow, particularly when
Labor had refused pairs. Countei-ing a
Labor stonewall, the Ministry had strangers
—morning-paper and Hansard reporters—
excluded for an hour. As dawn approached,
Labor became more tractable, and in the
THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO SAINT MATTHEW.
“The Federal Labor party, in its election campaign, is strenuously seek-
ing to dissociate itself from Bolshevism.”
MATTHEW CHARLTON: “ Er—get thee behind me, Satan."
SATAN BOLSN: “ Yon bet, boy; I’m behind you all the time—in
everything !”
lust half-hour members were as friendly as
if they were engaged in increasing their own
salaries. The Ministry has thus leaped what
it regarded as the stiffest hurdle of the
session; now it may limp into recess.
The Leg. Councillors of N.S.W. have put
in a mild request for salaries, though in
their present unpaid condition the demand
for the position is fierce enough. They say
they represent “practically” the only un-
paid House in existence, though the 740
peers of Britain are in the same category.
This and the unpaid House in Britain cer-
tainly are unique in, one respect: their possible
siz6 has no limits. The Council of the Ma
State might consist of 250 members if some
obliging Governor or Deputy-Governor saw
no objection and the supply of applicants
held out. Even Maoriland, after trying the
seven-years’ appointment system since 1801.
has put an elective Upper House on its
statute book, though three nominee Maoris
may be thrown in for flavoring.
A sort of lost-soul wail went up from Vie.
legislators when the Treasurer announced
that increased financial burdens were in the
offing. The announcement was overdue. Vic-
toria has consistently taxed itself below the
average, and a few years ago it took West-
ralia’s place as the least-burdened State of
the crowd. Under the long and dull Lawson
Ministry it threw its reputation for economy
in the loan-razzle line to the winds and let
many things go to seed, its police force and
its education system among them, that it
might combine a craze for settling the big-
gest number of people on farms with the
old brag about having the smallest tax bill.
The fowl had to come home to roost some
time.
The bill to facilitate the proposed conver-
sion of the old Duncan home at Mitcham
into a Government House was lost in S.A.
Leg. Council on the casting vote of Lance
Stirling. The aged President explained that
he felt bound to vote in a way which would
“allow further consideration of such a seri-
ous step as moving the Governor out from
the historic central position in the city.” The
measure would have been badly defeated but
for the feeling some Opposition members had
as to the delicate position of their colleague.
Walter Duncan. The Gunn Ministry, which
is bent on the removal, is now looking
thoughtfully at the old Rymill home, also at
Mitcham.
A year ago, cheered on by Allan and the
other 11 militants of the Cocky party, Hogan,
then Vic. Labor Minister for Agriculture,
bullocked through a Compulsory Wheat Pool
Bill, which the Uppah Chambah promptly
rejected. Last week Premier Allan, head
of a Compo. Cabinet, had to listen while
Hogan flayed him for “abandoning his prin-
ciples,” and submitting a measure for the
continuance of the voluntary pool for five
years. But Hogan knew that he was talking
guff; there is no prospect of converting the
Plush House to a compulsory pool, and
Allan, being now in a responsible position,
couldn’t see any use in merely lighting
crackers to throw at the Leg. Council.
The Henry Georgeites of Sydney, other-
wise the Land Values and Freetrade League,
held their little annual palaver the other
day, and the chairman voiced the usual pro-
test against “a few people being allowed to
own the land to the disinheritance of the
rest.” Of every 10,000 acres in the North-
ern Territory, the private landlord owns 14
and the community possesses the other 9986.
And see how prosperous the Northern Terri-
tory is!
Matters of long-distance hatred in N.S.W .
Labor circles are the proposal to reduce the
men who refused to join in the railway
strike of eight years ago to their 1917 status,
thus cutting out any promotion which might
have come to them in the interval: the pro-
motion of the strikers; the discharge of the
new men who came on during stirring
period; and the forcing of. the Newcastle
and Hunter River do. to dismiss its wharf
staff—said to belong to the wrong kind of
union. This makes ft: all the more desirable
that Minister Willis should leave off Scrip-
tural quotations like “Vengeance is Mine,
1 will repay, saith the Lord.”
McCormack, though handicapped by a
habit of falling ill at critical moments, is
tipped in Queensland as the next Labor
Premier. He lost the leadership by one
vote when Gillies was elected, and has been
taking it easy since. McCormack is an inti-
mate friend of Theodore and lias the backing
of all the Thcodorians in the caucus; he
has been in turn Speaker, Home Secretary,
Minister for Lands, Acting-Treasurer and
Deputy Premier. Only two obstacles stand
in the way of McCormack’s ambition : Labor
has to win the next State elections, and
Gillies has to be provided with a worth-
while post outside Parliament. And the
State Governship is not available —yet.
Talking about immigration, Adam Smith
( “Wealth of Nations”) pointed out that one.
great reason why people went to the British
colonies in America (now the U.S.A.) wa-
that “in c< .sequence iff the moderation or
their taxes, a great proportion of their pro-
duce belongs to themseltes.” In other words,
the smaller he taxation the more attractive
the country to immigrants. To put it in
round (igur s. Queensland’s public-service bill
for M'oi i inhabitants is 130 times larger
than Air. : ica's was in 1776 for 3.000.000
people. Or, in another way, the bill in
the. one case was sd. per head; in the other it
is £lo per head. No wonder the most
derlr.ib! • British immigrant to Queensland
is a v ry shy and rare bird.
The Brisbane City Council, which passed
out unlamented on September 30, spent its
last few days in erecting memorials to
itself. The unfinished Centenary Reserve
was formally dedicated to the public, and
a tablet was affixed to the City Hall (which
won’t be completed for three or four years)
claiming credit for the work. There is
a more permanent memorial in the civic
debt, left by the defunct body to the Greater
Brisbane Council, but there has been no
bragging about that.

THE LEAVE-GIVERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Attorney-General in hardly audible tones
asked members of the N.S.W. Assembly to give him
leave to bring- in a bill to raise their salaries....
Mr. Bavin subsequently taunted the Minister with
speaking- in low tones because he was ashamed of
the bill.”
In accents somewhat faint he craved permission
To add a trifle to his hearers’ screws,
And none regarded him with dark suspicion,
Impugned his motives or arraigned his views,
Or showed, in fine, the mildest disposition
To make a song about it or refuse.
No apple of discord this, but one like Eve
Proffered to Adam—and they gave him leave!
They gave him leave. They raised no more objections
Than sharp-set lions and tigers at the Zoo
When keepers bring their afternoon refections.
Red junks of horse to tear and bones to chew.
They gave him leave, albeit at the elections
The subject wasn’t even alluded to.
Freely, with ready grace, they acquiesced
In that appealing, timorous request.
He spoke his piece with something like a quaver,
Not with the airy confidence begot
In one who asks a derelict to savor
A bit of steak and sink a foaming pot;
In short, he spoke as one who craves a favor
And doubts if it will come his way 7 or not.
It should have reassured him—never a stir
Of protest or a whisper of demur!
He looked a little diffident and flurried,
As if he thought he had a ticklish task..
Ifct, were there any shocked or grieved, they hurried
Their ruffled feelings courteously to mask.
None showed resentfulness. He needn’t have worried.
It wasn’t such a mighty lot to ask.
But Parliamentary custom, I conceive,
Requires it. Anyhow, they gave him leave.

When spot prices of crude rubber touched
3s. early in July, many people believed there
would soon be a tumble. Speculators were
said to have been caught short, and forward
contracts for 1920 were booked at little more
than half the price. But here is October,
and the latest quote was around 3s. Od.
after 4s. 2d. bad been registered in August.
The increase in consumption undoubtedly has
been in excess of most estimates. Of the
world’s production of rubber 75 p.c. goes
into tyres, and tlie adoption of ‘‘balloons”
by motor users lias eaten up standing stocks
and caught up to the restricted production.
How long prices will hold can be only a
matter for guessing. Still, there is something
to go on. Restriction was introduced in
November, 1922. Although British cos.
operating in the Dutch East Indies volun-
tarily entered the scheme, Dutch growers
stood aloof. Prior to restriction, their out-
put was 80,000 tons p.a.; for 1924 it was
153,000 tons, the current year's production
is estimated at 200,000 tons, and they still
are planting. That Port Swettenham has de-
clared its first div. on ords. since 1912, and
Bukit Ivubu —-another Australian co.—-has
distributed 15 p.c.. the first yield since 1920,
is an indication that the higher prices are
very profitable, and for that very reason
there can be no guarantee that they will
last.
Although it is understood that Dunlops
bought well, prices of manufactured goods
have reflected the upward move in the raw
product, and the second increase in prices
of tyres came into force on September 1.
Naturally the eo. has in these circumstances
done very well. Gross profits for 1924 were
£388.804’: last year, £494.232. Net profits
were a record by tens of thousands. So
opulent was the retuf-n that the management
brought £222,428 into the daylight, out of
which it voted £5OOO to the officers’ super-
annuation fund, and lifted the rate on ordi-
naries from 7 to 9 p.c. Actually, after the
10 p.c. cum. prefs. had received attention,
there was enough to have given the ordi-
naries 14 p.c. without eating up every pound.
But there was wisdom in sending a fat lump
to reserves, with goodwill in at £lBO,OOO.
Not that there isn’t a lot of goodwill in the
name Dunlop, but with amazing inventions
crowding on the heels of other amazing in-
ventions, it is just as well to have all the
capital represented by assets that you can
feel with your fingers. Capital did not
change during the year, but it has been de-
cided to issue 292,835 of tlie 1,308,658 ordi-
naries unallotted. Shareholders are offered
the new shares at par in proportion of one
for four held. The money is needed chiefly
in connection with the new Dunlop-North
British Rubber Shoe Co. Pty.. Ltd. This
amalgamation of the rubber-footwear section
of Dunlop manufacturing with the North
British represents a big addition to Austra-
lian industry. The new shares will raise
capital to £1.984.177 —£520,000 in prefs. and
£1,464,177 in ords. Previous movements in
capital since early in the co.’s history have

Progress of later years has been rapid, and
the capitalisations have given old holders a
royal feast. In 1920 assets were written
up, hut the appreciation could not have been
reckless, for, although the co. carries im-
mense stocks, it weathered the storm follow-
ing the heavy crash in rubber prices in 1921
and again in 1923-24 without Visible diffi-
culty.
On June 30, 1921. stocks amounted to
half a million ; liabilities were
£829.255. At the latest balance stocks were
£790,013 and creditors were relatively small
at £296,321. That comparison makes clear
just how the position has been tightened up
in the past five years. Here are other com-
parisons

Profs, are strongly supported; they stand
for only about one-fourth of the co.’s funds.
The outlook for ordinaries is good, too: but
it is just as well to note that only once
hitherto has the profit reached the amount
required to pay last year’s dividend. Skilful
management may prevent the co. suffering
from the violent fluctuations in the rubber
market; but it is really too much to expect
that the co. Mill always gain by them.

•Portion of year only.
Little more profit was disclosed than M'as
necessary to pay the 74 p.c. div.; but, as
usual, additions M’efe first made to reserves;
£25,000 to insurance account and £30,000 to
repairs, renewals and replacements. There
is little doubt that both of these funds con-
sist of true profits; at any rate, their con-
tents at that time and approximately a mil-
lion besides went to the 1920 capitalisation.
Indeed, it is not unlikely that true net earn-
ings Mere even greater than the figure of
the table. Not a M 7 ord is said in the report
as to the buccaneering expeditions of the
seamen, possibly lest, it might set the public
reflecting that there may be other privateers
along the coast. Nor do the accounts dis-
close the earnings from coal-mines and
other subsidiaries. So long as the shipping
cos. show such profits and give grounds
for the suspicion that some more have been
slipped aM r ay for future distribution, just
so long will the unions find encouragement
for their hold-ups. Meantime the public pays.
Last year there M’as a good deal of disturb-
ance around the coast; yet, despite a big
holding of assets in low T -interest bearing
investments, visible profits M'ere equal to
almost 9 p.c. on average funds. Those M’ho
have held their shares for some time are
getting about 20 p.c. p.a. And still older
hands are doing better than that ; for capital
Mas doubled by an issue of bonus scrip iu
1902.
In the past three years attention has been
given to the building up of the fleet which had
been depleted by losses during the M ar years
and by sales subsequently. Adelaide Steam
added good luck to good control in the days
before the war. It had built ambitiously and
was heavily laden with tonnage on which it
owed much money M’hen the Great Scrap
came to turn its temporary troubles (if they
were troubles) into profits. It M’as a rich
time. Then came the Navigation Act and
the provisions M'hich made the big passenger-
carriers so much less profitable that they
M’ere got rid of. In 1924 the neM r steamei-s
Arcoona and Allara replaced some of these
ships; in March last the Ulooloo arrived
and entered the coastal trade the Dundula
and Dilga have been bought from the Com-
momvealth Shipping Board, and contracts
entered into for the construction of three
motor cargo vessels (Mulcra, Momba and
Mundoo), all of which are expected to arrive
before this fiscal year is out. Balance-sheet
figures showed' a singular lack of movement
under the circumstances. In the assets public
securities and shares in other cos. are
bundled up with steamers (including vessels
building) and other shipping property and
premises. This composite item M’as £44,138
greater than at June 30, 1924. Common-
wealth stock was £87,140 less, but book
debts, etc., were £62,796 higher, and total
assets showed a net increase of £37,989.
With new steamers to pay for, an increase
in liabilities might have been expected. In-
stead a decrease of £24,294 was shown. So
far as liquids are visible here is the position
over the past three years;—
1923. 1924. 1925.
Liquid assets .. . . £615,202 £634,313 £628,164
Liabilities (excluding
Provident Fund) .. 232,331 223,086 195.792
Surplus assets .. £382,871 £411,227 £429,372
That is a comfortable position, the better
in view of the purchases. And there is, in
addition, whatever may be the amount of the
liquids lumped with the fixed assets. The
pound shares —there are 2,325,135 of them—
are quoted b. 20s. 6d., s. 215., so it doesn’t
look as though the market expects more than
74 p.c. for a good while, notwithstanding that,
the average amount added to reserves during
the past rive years has been £42,800 p.a.
The explanation; no doubt, is that the inves-
tor lias little confidence in any industry
which must employ much labor—especially
maritime or coal-mining labor. It is true
that up to now, when employers in these
industries have been stung, they have passed
the load on to the public; but there is a limit
to that, and other industries which suffer by
it are beginning to show their teeth.

Figures for the past decade show that,
despite competition in its field by the great
banks, it is holding the old and getting its
share of the new business ; and that indicates
no lack of virility. Being a one-town bank,
the proportion of funds to outside money
has to be kept high :
1915. 1920. 1925.

Advances .. .. 311.533 370,793 423,636
Premises . . .. 2,597 6,508 5,000
On June 30, for every £ of its own it held
only 355. 9d. of the public’s money ; and that
of course limits the profits. The liquid
position was £28,875 better than it was a
year ago, slightly less than 37 p.c. of total
liabilities being in liquid form. That is
nearer to the 40 p.c. usually aimed at than
has been the ease on many other occasions
and should be adequate. Depositors and
other creditors are well secured; on June 30,
visible assets with a book value of £558,247
covered total liabilities of £352,801, so that
more than 7s. in the £ could disappear
without the public’s money being jeopardised.
It is rather wonderful that in these days
of amalgamations this little bank should con-
tinue its independent life; but sentiment has
saved it. And, though its size and local
character handicap it, it is able, knowing
its customers so thoroughly, to do a certain
class of profitable business which bigger and
more diffused banks couldn’t risk.

That div. was paid in January. The direc-
tors plead that sufficient profits in hand and
bright prospects for the second half of the
veair encouraged them to do it. But “several
important water-supply schemes, which it
was anticipated would at once be proceeded
with, have been delayed.” During the latter
six months of the term the factory was not
fully employed, and abnormal floods experi-
enced in connection with one contract detri-
mentally affected trading profits. Most
of the work which the eo. handles is depend-
ent oil loan expenditure, but even in the
borrowing saturnalia of the war and post-war
years there was nothing much in it for share-
holders. The 1920 reconstruction resulted
from fear of legislative interference rather
than an over-estimate of the co.’s Position.
The 10 p.c. divs. of the two following y *-
(equal to 15 p.e.) were the only two returns
worth while. Since then shareholders na\
had a total of (»’ p.c. The Board has given
“serious consideration” to the problem, a
has decided to start a small general timDei
and joinery business at the Lane Cove worn..
considering that “this sideline should pro\«‘
a valuable adjunct.” Presumably trading
prospects have been thoroughly reviewed,
but recent experiences of timber-traders do
not inspire enthusiasm.
The financial position is easy enough, as
the following balance sheet figures show

tion from new patent pipes the co. is getting

supply and hydro-electric works in iN.fcs.W.
and Vic. The market, however, is hot en-
thusiastic, sellers of fully-paid £1 shares

Ordinaries got 24 p.c.—the second small
taste in four strenuous years. The co. #as
shown the combined effects of high wages
and a low tariff more than _ most manufac-
turers, and has been increasingly obliged to
turn to overseas agencies to help it out.
During the war years and after it was im-
possible to obtain adequate supplies of
plumbers’ brassware in Australia; and just
on the eve of the slump a controlling in-
terest in a Melbourne foundry Mas bought.
But foreign products soon poured in and
prices tumbled. After two and a half years
the management decided to' close that ven-
ture down. That was in .January. 1024, and
since then it has been realising the assets.
The closing saved money, and it is believed
that provision has been made to meet every
possible loss on realisation. The firm’s engi-
neering works in Sydney had been losing
money, too: but drastic reorganisation had
brought them back to a profit-earning basis,
and then crash ! came the 44-hour week in
N. S. Wales. However, it is no use merely
crying about it; and fortunately other con
ditions are so helpful that “the current year
has opened well, and several profitable con-
tracts have been secured.” The balance-
sheet position is a shade better, too :

Stocks, although still heavy, have been
slightly reduced, and holdings in subsidiary
cos. are being got rid of. following a deci-
sion to confine the eo. strictly to its own
business. To make up for the limbs that
have been sawn off new American agencies
have been obtained which are expected to
prove profitable. With almost £309,000 in
book debts and stocks the management hasn’t
an easy task, and heavy dependence on out-
siders is unavoidable. But, though it isn’t
likely that the immediate future holds much
for shareholders, profits have beep won in
an unsatisfactory year, and that is some-
thing on which to pin a hope.

reconstructed, and this co. was formed with
two subsidiaries, Ellis Bakeries, Ltd., and
Ellis Cafes, Ltd.; , and another pup, Ellis
Cafetaria, Ltd., is to run a quick-lunch
house on the American pattern. The ori-

taking over three Adelaide eating-houses and
a bakery. The war years brought their
troubles, but shareholders later got their
reward, divs. from 1920 being 10 p.c., later
15 p.c. and 174 p.c. in 1924. In addition
there was a bonus distribution of £14,383
in January last. This first balance-sheet

The general utility of Pioneer Wood Pipe for indus-
trial purposes is evidenced all over Australia. This
report from the Davis Gelatine (Australia), Ltd., is
typical of many. An extract reads: “The Superin-
tendent of the Works and the Chief Engineer speak
most highly of the Wood Stave Pipes supplied by

extensive one, has been in continuous use for four
years, and so far no defects or sign of insect attack
have been detected.” The Australian Wood Pipe Co.,

Recently Brilliant shareholders (W.A.)
were cheered by the official announcement
that a 19ft. reef had been cut in the bottom
level. A later report reduced the thickness
to 10ft., which, although good enough, doesn’t
excuse the error in the first report. Milling
operations have commenced, and, although
there isn’t sufficient stuff available to enable
the battery to run continuously, shareholders
may expect the gold extracted. from the
limited tonnage to make a break in the long
series of calls. Later on, when stoping is m
progress, the output will improve until the
level is worked out. Then winter will come
again.
* * * *
Ives Reward shareholders (W.A.) were
told many times that more gold would be put
into the mine than would be taken out;
still they paid calls and hung on. The mine
is not short of ore; the weak point lies m
the fact that at St. Ives the recoverable value
can’t be made to furnish divs.

Emu Co. (W.A.) intends to do some more
drilling at Wiluna. The previous bore dis-
closed 40s. values, which is equal to the
average value of the main Wiluna crosscut.
As width was also satisfactory _ the Emu is
looking forward to doing well in the boom
which Perth and Kalgoorlie are confident is
approaching.

Westralia’s latest gold find is near the
Mundi Windi telegraph station, between
Peak Hill and Marble Bar, about 250 miles
from the railway head at Meekatharra. A
32ft. reef, said to be of ounce value, has been
traced for several hundred feet, and other
formations which so far haven’t been pros-
pected are alleged to be outcropping there.
Already the finders have received telegrams
from near and far asking for options.
* * * *
From a man on the spot:—
Manxman field (W.A.) has proved a disappoint-
ment to its supporters, and already the burial of
the dead has commenced. Tclfer North and Radio
South have been interred, and little hope is entei-
tained for the recovery of Radio Deeps, whose two
bores proved calamities. Ives Prop., testing a
lease under option n.-e. of Radio, has located
promising surface indications, and is shaft sinking
to ascertain if these will lead to something payable.
At a point one mile s.-e. of Radio, S. Lang has
disclosed a lode on the surface from which lOoz.
values have been obtained. So far the high values
have been confined to narrow widths, but, making
due allowance for this, Lang has found something
worth following up. Bulls rarely get so poor a
run with a decent show as in the case of the Radio,
whose series of quartz veins has been proved to a
depth of 280 ft. on the underlie. Admittedly, the
veins are on the thin side, but their gold content
is £l2 per ton. Whether the mine is worth the
purchase consideration —-£40,000 cash —may be an-
other matter. In the first instance, shares were
rushed from 2s. to 95., but from the latter figure
have steadily declined to the former. The informa-
tion W.A. shareholders are seeking is, “What opinion
has engineer Jensen expressed of the mine?” Jensen
frequently visits the show, but only the directors
appear to be furnished with his views. The opinion
W.A. investors hold of Adelaide methods in con-
nection with the Radio is unpublishable.

Sutherland Lode, Kiandra (N.S.W.), hav-
ing placed its 15,000 reserve shares of 25.,
has resumed work. Half a dozen sons ot
Italy will punch the shaft down and drive
levels under Frank Stones direction. It is
now or never with the show.

Belimbla Creek, Nerrigundah (N.S.W.),
failed by long chalks to live up to the tore-
casts of Joseph Campbell and chairman
Chas. Napier. Instead of the stream ot
gold” running friom the “great battery
early in January, October finds a reconstruc-
tion' proposal whereby capital is to be in-
creased to £19,000 by creating 40,000 2s.
shares. This will increase the register to
190,000, of which 60,000 are vendors . I here
is still the silence of the grave about bat-
tery results while the plant ran. The mam
tunnel, timed to cut the “Great Gold Lode
in December last at 950 feet, still has 3;>o
feet to go. and the extra £4OOO of capital
is to continue the job. A section of share-
holders have had enough, but the remainder
voted in favor of giving the optimists an-
other run.

A note about prospecting by wireless:—
Lease owners call in the mining expert to advise
them. They have lost the ore —where is it? Results
have taught them that no amount of learning will
give the power to see through the earth. In the
last 12 months, however, the radio operators have
emphatically proclaimed: “We have changed all that.”
The directional beam is the eye that can search from
the surface downwards, from level to level, from
shaft to shaft. In N. S. Wales, F. H. Fraser and
Major T. J. Farrow have been working on this line
of research. Their apparatus is to have a trial
this month at Hall's Peak, near Hillgrove. The
lease-holders there have cut a lode diagonally (e.
to w.) passing through 20 feet of ore and 60 feet of
ore and slate. It is believed to run north. What
is its extent? An assay shows gold 25 grains, silver
10.10 z., copper 2.1 p.c., lead 12.3 p.c., zinc 22.1
p.c. A shaft sunk on gossan 4ft. wide at the
surface missed the lode. To mine the lode, a
tunnel of 200 ft. must be driven from the mountain
side But it is as well first to be sure of the exact
position and extent of the lode. Hence the call for
Major Farrow and his apparatus. On the steep
mountain side for 600 feet from the crest there
are good indications of ore. After the wireless
investigation, if the report is satisfactory, work
is to be pushed on with energy. Mining men have
expressed their interest in the investigation, and
some of them will go to Hall’s Peak. Rough accom-
modation will be available for a stay of one or two
days. Any reader who may be desirous of further
information may communicate with J. B. Rickard,
84 Pitt-street, Sydney.

C. M. Owen is visiting the Cloncurry dis-
trict to consult with W. 11. Corbould as to
the best method of mctallurgically operating
Mount Isa ores. When Owen arrived at Mount
Isa on September 19 .T. B. Miller was on
his way to Lawn Hills, and Corbould sug-
gested to Miller that it would be a nice com-
pliment to pay the visitor to ask him to
accompany him (Miller) on his trip to Lawn
Hills. The offer was accepted, and Owen
spent an interesting two weeks going to
Camooweal, Lawn Hills and Burketown. He
is one of the foremost metallurgists in the
United States—was lately general assistant-
manager for the Federal Mining and Smelt-
in o- Co. in Idaho (capital, 18,000,000 dol-
lars) , which operates an immense tonnage ot
silver-lead ores. Owen will remain at Mount
Isa for a few weeks making himself familiar
with its ores.
Great Northern, Herberton (N.Q.), re-
cently sold a 33-ton parcel of tin concen-
trates —the largest for two years. Another
shilling div., the second in the past three
months, was declared after the sale.
Stanhills (N.Q.) is busy on the battery
and dam which the Government is assisting
to build. The prospects of the Mauretania
are keeping interest in the field alive, and
most of the old shows have been pegged out
again, among the latest being the Hope.

The report of an oil find at Clermont (Q )
a couple of months back had nothing behind
it. A prospecting area was taken up ann
the place was supposed to have shale almost
oozing drops of oil. But the oil can only
be obtained by distillation and the stuff is
low grade, the Government Analyst’s tests
showing only 22 gallons per ton. A subse-
quent analysis showed the material to be a
variety of coal, and not oil shale at all. As
coal is rather a drug on the market in those
parts, nothing further is likely to be heard
of it for many , a day.
The Bowen Consolidated Coal Co. has suc-
ceeded in raising sufficient capital to modern-
ise its equipment. Operations are now in
progress on the Bowen seam lying under the
Garrick, which was formerly worked, and
output has increased considerably. The next
move will be to look for export trade,. of
which Queensland lias none worth speaking
of. Export is a necessity if the coal-mining
industry up there is to expand, for the State
can use only a' fraction of wbat is offering.
* * * *
The Coolgarra (N.Q.) tin battery is to
be tuned up in the hope of getting a clean
concentrate from the complex ores of the
district, which carry small quantities of
iron, bismuth, copper, etc. Efficient re-
covery of the tin will be a godsend to this
district, which has every chance of develop-
ing several decent mines from the shows
now working. At present 50s. freight to
Silver Valley is crippling operations on ore
averaging about 3 p.c. tin. Alongside of the
Magdella. one of the best shows, a recent
discovery called the Silent I riend shows
prospects. It has a lode formation 12 to
14 feet wide with values around 3 p.c. A few
months’ Work should prove its worth.
* * * *
The Bluff Coal Co*, of Ttockhamptolh
(C.Q.), is operating a new seam near the old
colliery workings. It is a thicker and better
seam in every way, and averages about Bft.
Calorific values are high, and, owing to its
real or supposed resemblance to Welsh
anthracite, the co. has called it the Cambria
seam. A shipment is to be tested by the
Australian navy, as it is almost smokeless.
Most of the navy tests of Rockhampton coal
have shown considerable clinkenng, but this
product is claimed to be O.lv. in that respect.
* * * *
Less than 20 miles from Melbourne and
right alongside the railway lies the Diamond
Creek gold-mine—one of the best proposi-
tions left among the old producers and
worked to a depth of 950 ft Gold worth a
quarter-million was won. The ore is kindl>
and the country presents no serious working
problems. In war time the mine was being
profitably worked, and then a fire broke
out and destroyed most of the surface gear.
War-time costs prohibited resumption, and
a reef which was worth £6 a ton. and was
in places as wide as the counter in the
local pub, awaits exploitation. A vertical
shaft, good pumping plant, and efficient
battery are required.
To enable it to carry out portion at least
of its developmental scheme, Vic. Govern-
ment has agreed to advance up to £lOOO to
the Gippsland Slate Co.. Glenmaggie (Vic.).
The company must spend as much as it
draws from the State from September —.>,
and Mines Department officers are to super-
vise operations.

Mining men interested in the improvement
of machines for handling the Malayan tin
deposits have not lost all interest in the suc-
tion cutter-dredge. The Castlemaine Thomp-
sons certainly failed with their big plant at
Tongkah Compound; but a man who was
on the spot tells the “Wild Cat that the
team operating the machine was inexperi-
enced and nobody with a knowledge of hydro-
statics was kept on the job. During the
penultimate run the boiler was actually fed
from a muddy gutter instead of from a clear
stream a hundred yards away; and at the
end of what was naturally a most unsatis-
factory run the Compound’s bucket-dredge
manager had to lend the crew some bars
to clear the mud away from the choked
tubes. It all suggests that the suction cutter-
dredge may yet be heard from. Those who
were interested in the original Tongkah know
the difficulties that co. had even with the
first bucket-dredges.

The drooping spirits of Tanami (N.T.)
shareholders were revived somewhat last
week when the office announced that ,T. r I.
Beckett and consulting-engineer A. H.
Stewart had booked from Perth to Wyndham
on the Bambra, leaving Perth on Oct. 22.
They will carry reduction plant and supplies,
which will be transported from Wyndham to
Tanami by motor-truck. The N.T. warden
announces that £BOOO wortli of crushing stuff
awaits treatment. Moreover. H. I. Jensen,
now in M.L., told a Sydney interviewer that
his references to the latent wealth of Tanami
had been far too modest, really.

The grouch of “Real Australian”: —
Lake Bunga borehole, near Lakes Entrance (Vie.),
failed because apparently it was bored in a syncline.
After 12 months the bore is still pouring out natural
gas through a column of water 1100 ft. deep in
a six- to eight-inch hole. It is estimated that, not-
withstanding a hydrostatic pressure of 5001 b. to the
cubic inch, about 14,000,000 cubic feet of pure
natural gas has run to waste during the 12 months.
In the United States and Canada, over £40.000,000
yearly is paid for natural gas for light, heat and
power. By its own pressure it can be piped to
towns 200 miles from the bores, of which there
are thousands in use. From Cincinnati, Ohio,
one natural gas co. operates 1900 gas wells
and has 2649 miles of gas mains. The best feature
of that distribution is that the gas is used to make
electricity in numerous towns within 200 miles.
There, natural gas can do better than petrol,
coal gas, oil fuel or coal at a mere
fraction of the cost. From Sale to Orbost, 104 miles,
natural gas has been revealed in several boreholes,
and it is suspected a big natural gasfield awaits
delimitation by drilling—drilling is cheap at around
£1 a foot for a six-inch hole. If water were shut
off, the supply of : gas would be greatly increased.
The directors of the co. owning the Lake Bunga
bore have appealed for advice and money to the
Vic. Mines Department, the Commonwealth Home
and Territories Department, and the Bureau of
Science and Industry, and they have been refused not
only money but even help to investigate the con-
ditions and prospects of this probable natural gas-
field. The co. asked that, Dr. Wade, the official
Federal geologist, should be sent to look at the
borehole so as to suggest how best it could be
examined or developed with a view to further pros-
pecting in the vicinity. Dr. Wade said he did not
think it worth while going to the district. And
there, for the time being, this important matter
rests.’ There’s plenty of public money for the
League of Nations, for Wembley, for Australia House,
for a Press Conference, for the Bush Capital, yet not
a stiver, shekel or wampum for a cheap new source
of power.

Takuapa, Siam, gets out of one set of
troubles to run into others. Yardage fell to
80,000 in September, and yield to oJ tons
against the 42 tons of August and 45 in
July. The electric motors, which have never
given real satisfaction, have, it seems, been
smitten with the stop-work craze. So dns.
again retire into the distance. Likewise the

“Percy Pinktape”: Include among casual
bridegrooms a shy youth in a Melbourne
office. He had been asked to “work back,”
and, although his department boss noticed
that he received the intimation with a shade
of reluctance, it was not sufficiently pro-
nounced to call for comment. Returning
after a brief absence from the office, the boss
remarked to the young man: “Jones, there’s
a young lady outside in the vestibule; she'
looks to me like the young lady who called
for you at lunch-time.” Jones flushed and
grinned sheepishly. “She’s my wife, sir,”
he said. “We got married during the lunch-
hour, and she’s waiting for me so that we
can go and look for some place to live in.”
The astounded head gave Jones permission to
grab his hat “at the toot” and prospect
for the honeymoon nest.

recent birthday celebration was followed by
the not altogether unusual police-court levee,
when a woman charged with assault excused
her conduct by a reference to the dreadful
language the other lady had used to her.
“When she made use of these expressions,”
said the Beak, scanning the paper upon
which they were written, “did you retaliate?”
The woman shivered. “No, sir!” she re-
sponded. “I ain’t in the ’abit of using such
language. I up an’ ’it ’er with a bottle.” A
reserve fund to pay any fines is an essential
feature of some Fitzroy functions. At one
recent one the M.C., after making a presen-
tation to the guest of the evening, appealed
to the gentlemen present to refrain from any
disorder when the affair was over. ‘The
committee is ’olding ten quid against any
fines,” he explained; “but if there ain’t no
fines the ten quid will be ’anded over to Bill.”

“Medicus”: In a few of the older towns
of N.S.W. there is a conservatism that rather
puzzles medicoes of the new school. Some of
the doctors, now
reduced to a com-
parative few, who
still drive round in
antiquated buggies
and can claim to
have brought half
the local popula-
tion into the world,
keep their practices
together more by
reason of a sort of
patriarchial influ-
ence than by any
profound knowledge
of their profession.
In bidding farewell
to one of this fast
disappearing school,
at a banquet given
in his honor upon
the occasion of
handing over to a
new man, one of the
speakers broke into
eloquence in this
fashion : “The doc-
tor always had- a
good horse, never a
bad one. He always
had a good dog,
never a mong. An’
if you went into his
back yard you’d
find some of the
best game-roosters
in the district. So
you may take it
from me he is a
sport and a man.”
Loud cheers, which
left the new man
wondering' how he
was going to get on. For he was merely a
highly-trained doctor.

“Blanc” : Most of the children now being

last week when I asked a young hopeful the
usual questions, including his father’s occu-
pation. “What work docs daddy do?” “Oh,”
came the reply quickly, “he doesn’t do any-
thing. He won the war, and gets a pension.”

“Te Babarantiko”: Those performances in

Bulletin naval writers were eclipsed scores
of times by Captain O. Kessler, who for
many years was in the inter-Gilbert Islands

soon ceased to sur-
prise traders to
find Kes s 1 e r’s
schooner, the Nep-
tun, at anchor in
their lagoon in the

entered in the
darkness of night
while steam trad-
ers waited for day-
light. This was
done in atolls re-
putedly four and
more miles out of

Admiralty charts,
without a single
lighthouse or fog
siren, in swirling
an d erratic cur-
rents, and in im-
perfectly surveyed

never had a mis-
hap. The secret
was nerve, com-
bined with the
knowledge (which
I from the fore-
cross-trees corroborated) that at night the
submerged coral growths and sandbanks
show up quite perceptibly darker than the
dark surface of the water,

“Griffith Moses”: One Sydney daily, doing
a farewell to George Fuller as Premier, said
he was otten at his desk by 8 a.m. I don’t
know why, but this reminded me that I
possess two biographies of old Francis Joseph,
Both agree that the monarch was at his desk
by five, that he had a secluded breakfast
among his papers about seven, that he
snatched a solitary lunch among a muss of
documents about one, and that after a seven-
o’clock-or-thereabouts dinner, which was as
sociable as uniforms, starch and family pride
permitted, he humped himself off to bed. He
did the work of 32 clerks and 24 office boys,
and t .ice daily the principal Ministerial de-
partments received each a portfolio of letters

and reports, with the Sovereign's misdirec-
tions thereon. Outside, in the long mean-
time, two matters went to the dogs—the Aus-
trian empire and the imperial family, though
the latter also had many reports written
about it. The Emperor’s two aged valets
committed suicide after his death. They
were fit for nothing except the service of an
employer who rose early, and after a heart-
breaking effort to *fit in with new masters
who went to bed late they shuffled off the
mortal coil together. Philip I. of Spain (the
Armada man) was another endless toiler,
and so were the two kings in “The Gondo-
liers,” but this tale of hard-working states-
men gr ..s too long.

“Grassy Flat”: There is a creek in South
Aus. that was used by the Baptists as a
dipping pond (B. 24/9/’25) over 60. years
ago. It ran alongside their church at Norton
Summit, then called Grassy Flat, and the
font was made of split stringybark logs
sunk in the creek’s course. “Sandy” Smith
was the first to be immersed, and the splash
he made brought the sap out of the logs
and turned the water black. Youthful Bap-
tists who were having their first view of
the ceremony never doubted that this was
the sin coming out of Sandy.

you can’t go about without trousers.” “This

“No one else has a right here where they
can see me. Why can’t Igo naked if I want
to?” The constable grappled with the pro-
blem, but no satisfactory auswer seemed to
present itself. “Well, what d’yer wear the

“Ces”- An innovation at this year’s Mel-
bourne Show was a loud-speaker apparatus
which broadcasted the results of the ring
events and other matters of interest. Several
sets of loud speakers were placed in the vari-
ous stands and at different parts of the
grounds, and results were known long before
the man at the board had painted them up.
In other ways, too, the broadcasting was
helpful, such as when a girl rider had a
nasty fall and a doctor was wanted in the
casualty-room; likewise Avlien little Willie
became separated from Mum, who was in-
formed by wireless where he could be picked
up again.

“Xuaved” : If a ring on the finger had been
an essential part of the marriage service (B.
24/9/’2o) I know one bride who would
have been in a difficulty. Shortly before
the wedding she met with an accident that
removed three fingers from her left hand
and badly damaged the right. She refused
to allow the ceremony to be postponed, how-
ever, and arrived at the church with both
hands heavily bandaged. When the time
came for slipping on the ring, it had to be
placed in her palm, and she now wears it oil
her right hand.

“Stanley”: The orcliardists at Mypolonga,
one of the irrigation settlements on the
Murray, a few miles from Murray Bridge,
have hit on an idea that is worth imitating.
A selected tree in every orchard carries a
plate setting forth: “The fruit from this
tree is donated to the Soldiers Memorial
Hospital, Murray Bridge.” Different vari-
eties of tree have been chosen, so as to ensure
the hospital a continuous supply of tresli
fruit for many months in the year; the gift
continues for the life of the tree. Such an
excellent notion might be adopted for the
benefit of other hospitals.

“L’Fou”: The English migrant with the
Oxford accent gazed from the Vic. railway
carriage window at the countryside bathed
in September sunshine. “Reminds me of the
early summer at home,” he remarked to the
tanned, leathery-looking man opposite. “Do
you happen to know the English Midland
counties at all?” The person addressed dis-
claimed any such knowledge, but the new
arrival hardly seemed to hear him; he went
on enthusing in monologue over the summer
“at home.” Suddenly the nondescript man
with the A.I.F. medal who hadn’t been in-
vited into the climatic symposium chipped
in. “I was looking forward to seeing an
English summer when I was over at the
war." he drawled; “it was just my darned
bad luck, I reckon —there was a court-martial
that day.”
QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION.
“She told me last night I’d have to marry
her.”
“Arc you going to?”
“No fear —my wife wouldn’t consider it for
a moment!”
“Northerner”: In the old days of Griffith
or Pope Cooper, when a new Queensland
Judge was sworn in the event was celebrated
decorously in Chambers. Nowadays the
presiding Judge says casually “Let’s wet it,”
and they all go across to the nearest pub
and breast the bar. I wonder if this sort
of thing is going to increase popular respect
for the courts.

SIGNS OF THE SEASON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Sydney policemen wore their white helmets on
Thursday for the first time since last summer.”
I said “I do not need the cuckoo’s din
To wise me - ‘summer is icumen in.’ ”
He eyed me with a slightly puzzled grin.
“That violets bloom,” I rambled on, “my nose
Apprises me, and where boronia blows;
But this is more official, I suppose.
“Past seasons have I known when flower and bird
<3ot off the mark too soon and badly erred.
But you’re infallible.” He spake no word.
“Damn calendars,” I swore, “and weather seers,
And Mares’s scientific hopes and fears,
And tots that yield to pots and rums to beers!
'‘Your lid,” I ventured, “has its message pinned
Aloft; it whistles winter down the wind.”
I smote him on the back. He seemed chagrined.
'“Your tile,” I finished up, “breathes tidings sweet.
T~ke it from me it suits you, too, a treat.
Why, man, you’ve got the ‘wanton lapwing’ beat.”
His face flushed red beneath the snow-white crest.
“Enough o’ that,” lie warned. “Go home —you’d best.”
And sternly: “Words like those invite arrest.”
He passed with dignity along his course.
He might have stayed if I’d been talking Horse....

“M.H.H.”: I was taking a walk last.
Sunday along the cliffs at a Sydney seaside
suburb, when a man and a woman hurried
past me, both wringing wet. The girls
stockings "were torn, her dress was a soaking
mass of doubtful colors, and her companion
was in equally sorry plight. I started re-
constructing a romance. I pictured the girl
swept off the rocks —there was a heavy sea
running—and the rescuer, possibly an entire
stranger, dashing in to her assistance and
gallantly bringing her to shore. Just as my
fancy was running on to wedding bells an
other man appeared from the scene ot the
mishap, and I asked him if he had witnessed
it. He said he had, and proceeded to outline
the story in the minimum of words. ‘ Married
couple. Had an argument round on the
rocks, and he pushed her. She caught him as
she was falling into a pool of water, and
dragged him in with her. Serves the brute
right, I say!”

“Ida D.”: “The Listening Insect” says
(B. 24/9/’25) that if an Australian, picks
up an Argentine with his wireless they can-
not exchange views on art, etc., because the
Argentine does not understand English. But
it is more than probable that lie does.
The educated Argentine can usually speak
three or four languages. English being one
of them. One of the first remarks made to
me in the Argentine was: “Be careful how
you criticise, and what you say; most ot
these chaps understand English.” Later on
SUCH GOOD IMITATIONS.
“Could you tell a lie, dear?”
“Not always. Sometimes they're so artistic they'd de-
ceive anybody.”
I found this to be true; but they dislike
speaking it, and will not do so unless it is
absolutely necessary and to their advantage.
Even on the English estancias it is a breach
of etiquette to speak English if an Argen-
tine is present, and it is necessary to be able
to speak and write in Castellano. before one
can be naturalised. Incidentally, the im-
mense radio station at Monte Grande, about
15 miles from Buenos Aires, is one of the
most up-to-date and high-powered plants m
the world. I have been all over this mam-
moth place and heard the operators converse
with Nauen in Germany and with New York,
and pick up an English vessel in the North
Atlantic. They wirelessed in English and
German. I quote this extract from my
Argentine diary of June 11, 1924: —
La Nacion [the leading daily in B.A. published in
Castellano] records a conversation between a wireless
amateur in Buenos Aires, and a station in Gisborne,
Poverty Bav, New Zealand. They conversed for two
hours, verified their difference in time, and arranged
that next day each should send the other a cable
confirming the conversation.
This was done —in English.

an old delusion when he says that, though
the Jewish sailor is rare, the Jewish laborer
NO RIGHTS IN IT.
“Dad, why is the English language called the mother tongue?”
“Because your father never gets a chance to use it, my son.”
is rarer. When the Railway M orkers and
General Laborers’ Union was only 1500
strong, there were 11 Cohens in its member-
ship. As for the nautical business, the Jew-
ish vessel which now plies between Aew
York and Palestine is entirely manned by
Jews, and there were so many Yids on the
Yankee warships recently in these parts that
special entertainments in their honor were
given in both Sydney and Melbourne. .An-
other exploded myth or stupid jocularity is
that which credits the Chosen with finding
it hard to make a living in Scotland, par-
ticularly in Aberdeen. As a matter of tact
there were three synagogues in that city
until recently, when two of them were amal-
gamated to supply the ministers with better
salaries.

“Alwyn”: A common belief is that the
bells which boom forth the time from Sydney
G.P.O. tower, and which some
musical people regard as woe-
fully in need of tuning, play no
set air. As a matter of fact
they render a tuneful composi-
tion of Handel’s “Lord through
this hour our footsteps guide.
Five in number, these bells form
part of a peal of ten, reproduced
from the peal of St. Mary’s,
Cambridge, and were chosen by
the celebrated Dr. Crotch. In-
scribed on the hour-bell, which,
by the way, weighs five tons, is.
the following: “His Excellency
the Earl Jersey, G.C.M.G.. Gov-
ernor ; the Honorable Daniel
O’Connor, Postmaster-General;
cast by John Taylor and Son,
Landborough, England, to the
order of Henry Daly, for Gov-
ernment of N.S.W., from de-
signs of Lord Grimthorpe, Q.C.,
LL.D. H.P.” (The last two
letters stand for “Henry
Parkes.”) Installed in 1891,
the bells were chimed for the
first time on Maf eking. Day.

“X2X" : There is hope for .the drugj-
addict in the recent discovery that the alka-
loicl known as codeine can be used for the
purpose of breaking off the opium or mor-
phine habit. The method is to reduce gradu-
ally the daily dose of the narcotic, and to
make up the deficiency with codeine, so that
eventually the patient is being given only
the latter. When this point has been reached
the codeine dose is withdrawn abruptly, at
the cost of only a few hours of discomfort
and sickness, and without the dreadful men-
tal depression, prolonged insomnia and ex-
cruciating physical pains that attended the
old “recovery.” The explanation is that
codeine is itself a derivative of opium, and,
like most of the other opium alkaloids, is
possessed of narcotic properties. But these
are so mild that they can satisfy the demands
of a system that has been saturated with
opium or morphine without setting up a new
craving. But the remedy only applies to
the morphine habit. The cocaine habit, far
worse and more tenacious, remains as diffi-
cult as ever to treat.

“X.D.”: The ghost of the Melbourne
Lands Titles Office, which’last year caused a
John Hop posted near the building to
resign from the force, has been scaring
more policemen. Nobody has seen the ap-
parition; it seems content to indicate its
presence by deep sighs and the swift pad
of running feet. Russell-street depot has
got rather tired of the spook, but when it
got an alarming report of noises which
suggested that someone had broken into the
building, a small squad was rushed down
to inspect. As the force entered the scurry
of retreating footsteps was distinctly heard,
but search of the building.revealed no traces
of any intruder. A cynical caretaker im-
putes the disturbances to the action of the
wind, when blowing from one particular
quarter, upon the ventilators.
“Adamascus”: Doctors wen: the first to
avail themselves of the facilities offered by
the W.Q. air service; now lawyers are fol-
lowing suit. S. N. Johnston, a Cloncurry
solicitor, recently had to attend the court
at Mt. Isa, 124 miles away, a three-days’
journey in the old style. He caught the air
mail at 7.15 a.nn, arrived at Mt. Isa an hour
and a half later, attended the court at 10,
and was back in his office at 4.30. R. L. IL
Peterson, a Long teach solicitor, had a simi-
lar trip last year to Winton when the. roads
were impassable through heavy rain. He
and his witnesses left Longreach in the morn-
ing and made the return trip on the same day.
“Riwaka”: The broadcasting of church
services may be a new idea, but telephoning
the service from the pulpit is not. It has
been done from one Methodist pulpit in
Melbourne nearly every Sunday for the last
nine years. A member of the congregation be-
came too deaf to hear ; the preacher, even
though’the listener wore one of those ’phones
made for such cases. A friendly electrician
took the ’phone apart, fitted the transmitter
into the pulpit, and ran wires to the rest
of the apparatus in his pew. Since then, lie
just switches in and hears every word, clearly.
Some envious brethren allege that, if lie
does not like the sermon, he just switches

against the kerbstone of that rather busy
street. Particulars of the accident were

about in the ocean. Dad made a note ot the
date and time, and three months later we
received the news that the son was m the
Southland when that ship was sunk, and
was in the water for three hours. The hour
and the day were identical.

Into the tram the vision swain,
A maiden tall and straight,
A perfect beauty minus sham.

Her hair was long—the “bob'’ she’d banned —
Her cheeks (and this was quaint)
Were innocent of powder and
Quite destitute of paint.

Gazed at the maid in awe,
For something strange—one might e'en call
It marvellous —they saw.
She sat her down, serenely grand;
Her face, that of a saint.
All destitute of powder and
Quite innocent of paint.
No liostick had her rosebud mouth
Defiled, no rouge had smudged
Her healthy skin; winds of the south
Had colored them, I judged.

I praise, without restraint,
Your face devoid of powder and
Quite destitute of paint!

By the death last week of Walter Reeks,
Australia lost her foremost naval architect
and ship-designer. Born at Christchurch
(Eng.) in 1861, he served his apprenticeship
in some of the most famous shipbuilding
yards of the country just when modern naval
architecture was emerging. In 1887 he de-
cided to come to Australia, and, settling in
Sydney, it was not long before he had become
firmly established. Amongst the best-known
craft which he designed was the racing yacht
Ihelma, and many of the vessels of the Syd-
ney Ferries Co. and the Manly Co. were built
from his plans. All his life he took a keen
interest in yachting, being a life member of
nie R.S.Y.C., and serving on the committee
as well as being vice-commodore. A widow
and daughter survive him.
Amongst the British seamen on strike in
Melbourne is John McGreen, who was one
of the Trevassa crew which wrote one of the
epics of the sea. He was in the boat in
charge of Captain Foster which set out from
the wreck on the long voyage to Rodriquez 1
Island with 20 men. For the first three
days the boatload fasted; after that half a
ship s biscuit and half a cup of water was
the daily ration. Two men went mad and
died; and when the island was reached only
three retained sanity—the captain, McGreen
and one Scully who, though 64 years of age,
bore the privations marvellously, and re-
lieved the captain in charge of the boat.
Bach man got £25 out of a subscription
raised in Mauritius—and afterwards
McGreen was six months out of work before
he could get another sea-job. And now some-
body has lured him into a course which is
likely to lead to him and many another
British seaman being unemployed for many
more six months, while foreign mariners
take the work from British ships.
James L. Watts, one of the pioneers of
sculpture in Australia, laid down his burden
in Brisbane at the 76tli milestone. He was
a Somersetshire man, who studied at South
Kensington. Australia lured him in 1884,
and ever since art in Bananaland has been
indebted to him. The Queensland Art Soci-
ety owed its foundation, in a large measure,
to him and he was its vice-president for many
years. Works from his chisel include the
South African war memorial in Edward-
street, Brisbane, and busts of former Queens-
land Premiers at the Executive Building ; and
a bronze statuette of a one-time Labor-
leader of Queensland, Dave Bowman,
adorns the Brisbane Gallery. The present
Curator of the Gallery is his son.

Superin ten dent Potter, Chief of the C. 1.8.
since 1921 and at one time a hot favorite
for the job General Blarney pow holds, was

with the C. 1.8. in 1891, and his work in
extending the finger-print system had an
international reputation.
For trifling with the affections of a chic
eostumiere from Noumea. Arnold Resell the
Sydney brewer, has paid £2OOO by way of
damages, and the costs may be twice that
amount. During the war Resch used to
intrigue the guard at Holdsworthy (N.S.W.)
internment camp by driving up from Sydney
in a Rolls-Royce to see .his father, who was
provided with separate accommodation.
A West-of-Darling product, he is handsome
in a massive way, very wealthy and, like
many sons of brewers and publicans, very
abstemious. He is no loafer on his dad’s
money, either: he was sent to Europe to
finish his education as a brewer, and there
are few men in the trade who Know more
of the science of the business and none who
work harder.
Harry Kneebone, who is resigning the
►S.A. Assembly seat for East Torrens to con-
test Boothby in the Labor interest against
Captain Duncan Hughes, was for many years
editor of the Daily Herald, now defunct.
Kneebone is well read and a prolific writer
on political matters. He carries with him
an atmosphere of earnestness and sincerity
•—also a walking-stick, a buttonhole and a
shock of curly hair.
Brother Nunan, who crossed the bar the
other day in his 77th year, was the last of
the small band of Christian Brothers who
came to Australia from Ireland 60 years
ago, and he was the first novice to join the
order here. With his three companions he
opened schools in Queensland, where he
stayed for 20 years before going to Victoria,
ht. Vincent de Paul’s Orphanage for boys

H. D. McLelland, recently retired chief-
inspector of the N. S. Wales Education
Department, served the State for 474 years,
and retained the esteem and genuine affec-
tion of the thousands of teachers he had
under his supervision. Cultured, discerning
and efficient, “H.D.” excelled in detecting
character and ability in his teachers, and
was quick to reward effort. Approachable
in interviews, he even showed patience in
listening to appeals for “removals,” though
he once remarked: “Our teaching service
is a most extraordinary one indeed. It
seems to be full of delicate parents with
healthy children and delicate children with
healthy parents, and a removal to Sydney is
the panacea for all.”
Dr. T. P. Mclnerney, who has been warden
of Melbourne ’Varsity Senate for 33 years
had his portrait by Longstaff presented to
him last week, and he, in turn, handed it
over to the Uni. Custody of it was taken
by John Monasli, vice-chancellor. “T.P."’
hasn’t fulfilled the promise of his youth.
After a very brilliant career at the Uni. he
dazzled juries and audiences with his fruity
eloouence, and beguiled reporters into taking
notes which were hard to condense. But
when Mason’s Act came into operation
he chose to become an amalgam. For three
years he represented a N.-E. constituency in
v ic. Assembly, but somehow he did not make
any mark there. Perhaps too much was
always expected of him.
Gone aloft, Captain Walter Jenks, R.N.R.,
who until his retirement was in steamers of
the Orient line for over 25 years. Beginning
his Australian career as second officer of the
Oruba, he wound up as skipper of the Oster-

ber for Bathurst, and the brightest inter-

m “boosting” the Commonwealth. To thou-
sands of migrants brought from Britain in
the Osterley he gave entertaining and in-
structive lectures with lantern views of Aus-
tralia. When in Melbourne and Sydney he
frequently journeyed far inland to familiarise
himself with the country and photograph it.
Once asked by a lady passenger how he
knew whether the Osterley was steaming in
the right direction, Captain Jenks explained
that he was guided by the compass needle,
which always pointed north. “Oh, I see,”
she observed; “and if you want to go south
you simply turn the needle that way.”
Labor has made things very easy for
Latham, K.C., by sending: out “Bunny” Bat-
ten to oppose him at Ivooyong (Vic.). Head-
quarters know that Batten has not the ghost

Tilley Brown, who relinquished his hold on
life at Brighton (Vic.) last week, had four
terms in Vic. Assembly between 1886 and
1904, and two in the Reps, between 1906
and 1910. He had in his palmy days the
bustling, hustling manner and the patter of
the auctioneer that he was—he was a great
hand at farm clearing sales. But lie never
could induce fellow-members to take him
at his own price, especially when new Cabi-
nets were being formed. He was middle-aged
when he first entered politics and 82 when
the call came.

to Augustus John in connection with the
portraits needed for the Peace Treaty record
he inquired if his own picture would event-
ually be offered for sale. The artist replied
that he would probably sell it later, and
named the price at about £5OO, which meant
that any idea Massey may have cherished of
acquiring it had to be promptly put aside.
But it is now possible that the Dominion
may finally possess the portrait; it is part
of the collection coming to the Dunedin Ex-
hibition, and it is unlikely it will be per-
mitted to leave M.L. without an effort being
made to retain it.
• Henry Figsby Young, who was one of the
founders of Melbourne’s historic Young and
Jackson’s, has just had a funeral. His father
was a reaper of Costs, but the M.L. goldfields
lured the boy. who, coming back, set himself
up in a pub in St. Ivilda, and in 1875 took
over an even then well-known business and
established Young and Jackson’s. It was he
who got together the pictures which make the
hotel unique. He was 82.
Major Bnrford Sampson, D. 5.0., who is
standing as a Nationalist, has a good chance
of topping the Senate poll in the Speck.
He saw service in the S’African War as well
as in the late disturbance, and after the
earlier disagreement spent some years in
the Rhodesian Mounted Police. In the late
war he was a couple of times badly wounded.
He is vice-president of the R. S. and S.
League, and one of the most popular Diggers
in the small island.
Australia's first-born Jesuit, Thomas
O’Brien, died recently in Austria. Born in
Sydney in 1843 he joined up with the Seven
Hills community in S,A., and after a while
completed his studies abroad. Afterwards
he spent some time in Australia, but 2t»
years ago he returned to Linz, in Austria.
A brother, John Xavier O’Brien, also joined
the society, and he died a few months ago.
The Victorian promoters of a memorial to
William Farrer hoped to raise thousands:
they have to do the best they can with a
couple of hundred. The best is a 10-guineas
prize to be awarded annually for an essay
on wheat breeding. There is also a gold
medal to be given away at Longerenong. It
is a poor kind of memorial to a man to whom
the Australian farmer owes so much, but
that is the fault of those who are slow to
recognise their obligation.
Daniel Desmond Griffin, just dead in
Hobart at 74, was born at' Wliiteford Hills,
the son of a previous Daniel, one of the
8 peek's pioneers. At the age of 21 young
pan, strong, active and 6ft. 4in., was super-
intendent of police in Deloraine —he claimed
to have been the youngest man in Australia
to hold such a post. When he left the police
force lie spent some years prospecting and
exploring; he was one of the first to break
through to the West Coast, and on his first
trip he slept oh the site of what is now the
Mt. Lyell mine. He was the chief mover in
forming the Deloraine Turf Club, which now
gives £lOOO for its Cup race. Besides racing
horses at different times he filled practically
every office, including that of handicapper.
For the best part of 50 years, as “Galtee
More” he wrote turf notes for Tas. papers,
and for 30 years he was “Coronach” of the
Australasian. His historical reminiscences
and researches were mostly published under
the name of “The Tramp,” and he talked-
as interestingly as he wrote.
T. W. Pinniger, 90, is Victoria's oldest
civil-service pensioner. He has been draw-
ing £4OO a year for 44 years. At present
the annual bill for public service and rail-
way pensioners is £462,000. The amount is
expected to fall gradually till 1944, when it
is anticipated that it will be £78,000. On
September 15 there were 3071 on the pension
list, and there are in the service 295 who
have superannuation rights.
The new Professor of Law at Adelaide
Cni. is A. L. Campbell, of Sydney. Like
Phillipson (now retired to Europe), his pre-
decessor in the Chair, he was present—as
secretary to Justice Rich —at the League of
Nations’ meeting in 1922. His qualifica-
tions are rather unusual. He took an arts
degree at Sydney in 1909. and another in
engineering (with honors) in 1913. He has
been associate to Rich, J., vice-principal of
St. Andrew’s College, and all through the
war was refused leave to enlist because of
his value as censor and interpreter. In his
profession he has been author as w r ell as
barrister, and has acted as a reporter for
the N.S.W. law reports.
The Water Waggon in Maoriland suffered
a severe loss, on the eve of the licensing
fight, by the death of the Rev. John Dawson,
general sec. of the
M.L. Alliance. The
Rev. John was a
Yorkshireman. born
<lO years ago. A
Primitive Methodist
parson, despite his
partiality for cold
tea, he never made
himself unpopular
with the tribe which
likes a stick in it.
TOM GIVENS,
President of the
Federal Senate,
who announces he
will not seek re-
election, principally
owing to Anno
Domini.
“Bris”: A well-known Queensland civil
servant, who has ridden on the water-waggon
for many a year past, was a frequent visitor
to the pub across the way in his unregenerate
days. A pious Treasurer called him on to
the carpet and remonstrated. “You know,”
he said, severely, “you went across to that
hotel nine times yesterday. I had a man
watching you.” “Sack the blighter!” came
the reply. “He can’t count. I was over
there 20 times!”
RHYME OF THE OBSCURE MEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The men obscure attempt, endure,
Conquer or nobly fail:
And here’s a rhyme of men obscure
Who rode behind a sail;
Who rode behind a schooner's sail,
W here schooners seldom go,
And left her by the beach to scale
The jungle bills of Matapau.
The men obscure —and there were four—
Cut tracks into the bills,
While niggers on their shoulders bore
The campware and the drills, #
The campware and the gleaming drills
To seek a hidden flow
Of oil whose seepage runs in rills
About t|ie swamps of Matapau.
They cleared a little area
And pitched a tent or two;
And one he got malaria,
A mishap scarcely new ;
A mishap that is scarcely new
W here men obscure they go—-
And three men dug a six-by-two
One fragrant night near Matapau.
And one he found the madness in
A soft kiss of the sun.
He watched the earth get up and spin
And guessed not why it spun,
And guessed not how or why it spun,
Mow swiftly and now slow—
But when the spinning thing had done
They dug his grave at Matapau.
The men obscure—and there were two —
They drove the niggers hard;
They worked the drills by twist and screw
With blistered hands and scarred;
With blistered, aching hands and scarred
They forced ’em down and low,
And camped them near two graves that marred
The moonlit (hills of Matapau.
A week, a month, three months and more,
And then they struck it true;
It gushed in glory from the bore
And soaked ’em through and through ;
It soaked ’em through and further through,
And joy that gods may know
Welled in the weary hearts of two
Men drenched in oil at Matapau.
The clicking tickers ticked a song
Two thousand miles away.
The bidding in the mart was strong
And shares soared in a day ;
And shares soared hundreds in a day
Where men eared not to know
T]hat two men more had yet to pay
The jungle debt of Matapau.
The men obscure attempt, endure,
Conquer or nobly fail;
bid two men of the men obscure
Alight pity men in gaol;
Alight pity healthy men in gaol
As fever-wracked they go
Seeking in bars another grail—
Forgetfulness of Matapau.

“Gelt": To ’ prevent a wound festering,
Kalahg and the members of his New Guinea tribe
pin their faith to the burning of the grass or
other object which has been bespattered with blood
I rom the wound. To these natives their blood,
saliva or spittle has a peculiar sacredness. The
tapping with a short, stick which 1 mentioned, and
which was quoted by “Parama” (B. 23/7/’25), does
not keep the wound from festering. Neither is
the grass burnt “around the wound” as “X2X”
(B. 30/7/’25) seems to imagine. There is no sug-
gestion of searing it.
FROM THE CREAM COUNTRY.
“Oi can’t see ’ xactly ’ow this separator fits on, sir.”
“Balala”: “Muckadilla” (B. 10/9/’25),
like many other supporters of the crow, should real-
ise the ghastly work these birds do. In 1913 at
Uralla (N.S.W.), during a dry spell in lambing
time, I lost 173 out of 1100 ewes through the
black devils. Usually half a dozen of them would
surround the ewe while she was down, and in less
than an hour leave her minus both eyes. In the
same year 1 lost several calves from the same cause.
*.* * *
“Sierra”: “Ratio” (B. 17/D/’2o), in dis-
puting my statement that the southern summers
should be hotter and the winters colder than the
northern, stresses the modifying influence of the vast
southern oceans. As water, owing to its great
specific heat, absorbs and radiates heat more slowly
than land, its chief effect is to retard the seasonal
changes of temperature on coastal land. Beyond that
(in the absence of hot or cold currents) it has very
little influence. “Ratio’s” comparison of the range
of temperature at Tokio and Vladivostock with that
of Adelaide and Hobart is not fair. The northern
towns are practically bathed in an arctic current,
while the southern towns are washed by water of
normal regional temperature. Even so, Adelaide’s
thermometer ranges from freezing-point to 116.3 deg.,
and 1 know of no northern city with so high a heat
rc< ord. Regarding Marseilles, its highest record
< 100.4) falls Meg. short of Hobart’s. A juster
comparison could have been made between San
t rancisco and Melbourne. These cities are in pre-
cisely corresponding latitudes (37deg. 48min.), and
tlie range of temperature from midsummer to mid-
winter is Bdeg. in the former and 74deg. in the
latter. New Orleans and Shanghai in the north
and Durban in the south are on about the 30th
parallel, and all three are washed by warm currents,
yet Durban's summer temperature rises 9deg. higher
than that of the northern cities; and in almost
every case, latitude for latitude, the highest record
rests with the southern towns. All of which goes
to prove that during the short summer the southern
lands receive a fiercer heat than do the northern
lands in their longer summer. A certain amount
of heat is drawn from the southern hemisphere
by the bulk of the equatorial current being diverted
towards the Arctic, where the intermingling of hot
and cold water and the resultant fogs and winds
give to the northern isotherms their fantastical
curves. Regarding the extreme cold of the southern
hemisphere little is known. The isothermic charts
which are carried north to the eightieth parallel
stop short at. the Antarctic circle; but the southern
ice-pack, which extends about 15deg. farther from the
pole than does the northern ice, indicates the severity
of the long southern winter. At- present the sun
lingers eight days longer between the equator and
Cancer than between the equator and Capricorn;
but time and the precession of the equinoxes will
alter that, and in a few thousand years the position
will be reversed.

“Globe Trotter”: This story was told me,
by the man who went through the ordeal. In the
olden days the abos. were pretty troublesome on
his country, and my friend was going through a
rough time with the drought. He had one day
occasion to go 100yds. from his hut to cut down
a beefwood tree as food for some poddy calves.
The distance being so small, he did not take with
him the revolver which all bushmen were at that
time accustomed to carry. Half a dozen myalls
suddenly appeared and showed that they were
prepared to make short work of him. His only
weapon was the axe, which, of course, was inadequate
to protect him from the spears. My friend, who
had had his head badly scalded in his younger days,
had ever afterwards covered the bald pate with a
wig. He dodged behind the tree, and at every
opportunity between the flung spears, thrust out
his head on one side of the tree with the wig on,
withdrew it, took the wig off and showed his bald
cranium on the other side. This so mystified and
scared the myalls that they cleared for their lives.
* * * •
“Koolamarra": There is a peculiarity
about the teeth of kangaroos which has escaped the
notice of 90 per cent, of bushmen, many ’roo shooters
included. I refer to the manner in which the animals
use the two long teeth that are so conspicuous on
the lower jaw. These
teeth are bevelled on
the sides, have a cut-
ting edge, and, when
not in use, overlap;
also they can be opened
or shut at will with
an action somewhat
' resembling that of a
pair of scissors, thus
enabling the animal
to feed on the short-
est of grass or herbage,
in the course of a dis-
cussion on 'roos some
years ago, I made the
above statement and
was greeted with
derisive laughter and
proclaimed to be the
world’s champion liar.
Several wagers were
made concerning the
accuracy of my state-
ment, and the matter
was ultimately referred
to the curator of the
Brisbane Museum, who
not only confirmed my
contention, but gave
us a lot of useful m-
formation regarding
the muscles controlling the teeth.
Jacky Roo : Can any sheepman tell me
how to induce a lambing ewe to mother her lamb
when she refuses to have anything to do with it?
When a ewe has got into difficulties while lambing,
she seems to be in such a nervous condition that no
persuasion or other means that I know of will make
her mother the lamb. I’ve tried tying her legs
together and leaving her with her offspring for
half an hour, but when I release her she at once
makes off in the opposite direction. I reckon we
are losing one per cent, of lambs through this
cause.

M. 15. 1922 : In the Milparinka and
Tibooburra district, through which I travelled
recently, are still some pathetic traces of Sturt’s
ill-fated exploration party of 1844-46. About 11
miles north-west of Milparinka is a stony hill; some
three miles below a fringe of gum-trees marks
Sturt s Rocky Creek. This creek is dry now except
where dammed for the convenience of Mt. Poole
station, named after the hill. The creek as It ex-
tends back into the Grey Range is overhung by
high cliffs of slate. Deep in between these cliffs
Rocky Creek was, in Sturt’s time, a shallow mean-
dering brook, running over heaps of flat stones. In
this glen, for six months in the broiling heat of
the drought, Sturt’s party was forced to camp; they
could not find water ahead of them and all the
Water behind them had been dried up. Poole, the
second in command, sickened. and died. Sturt
buried him under a beefwood tree on the banks of
TEMPERAMENTAL.
CIROUS PROPRIETOR: “Wot’s up with the lion — ’e’s roaring ’is

the creek, and the tree still stands over the grave.
Carved on its trunk in a diamond is “J.P. 1845” ;
the marking is still distinct, so the tree must have
been fully grown 80 years ago. Another interesting
relic is the cairn on the top of Mt. Poole. Sturt
was determined to keep his men as fit as possible.
Every day-, therefore, the whole party had to climb
to the summit of Mount Poole over a country covered
with boulders, and even now, in the springtime,
almost devoid of vegetation. Arriving at the top,
every man placed in position daily a large rock,
sometimes 3ft. in diameter; and to-day Sturt’s
Cairn looks down from Mount Poole on the pros-
perous sheep country below. It is about Bft. high
and was erected around the pole bearing the ex-
plorer’s flag; remains of the old pole may still
be seen.
* * * *
“Verri”: When the N.S.W. Department
of Agriculture recently consulted the Wellington
(M.L.) Acclimatisation Society on the advisability
of introducing stoats, ferrets and w-easels to deal
with the rabbit pest, it received anything but an
encouraging reply. The M.L. authorities deprecated
the use of these animals except as a last resource,
and the majority of the M.L. societies interested in
the matter would probably strongly discourage then-
introduction on any excuse, believing that of the
two evils the rabbit is decidedly the lesser. The
advent of the ferret and his friends in M.L. meant
death to the native birds in their track, the wingless
kiwi and rare kakapo being particularly easy vic-
tims, while a, diet of birds’ eggs found such favor
with the importations that they abandoned the
rabbit burrow in favor of the more easily attainable
nest. For a country with prolific bird-life to
import these pests would be folly verging on idiocy,
and the net result in a brief time would be a
great diminution in bird life and a tremendous
increase in stoats, weasels and ferrets, while the
rabbit situation would be left much as it
originally was.

“Up North - ': Among the Myall abos.
women who grow a hefty beard are fairly often
met with. I remember one such, more shameless
than Eve, who stepped from behind a cabbage-tree
palm clothed in sunny smiles. Her shingle was very-
thick and matted, and hung around her shoulders
like an overgrown mop. The tufted ends of hair
were jambed into the seed-capsules of the blood-
wood-tree and fixed with pellets of clay. Her
beard was treated in the same way, and around her
neck was strung a thick fringe of the capsules,
suggesting a fantastic cravat. As for the rest, she
didn’t look too bad. About half a mile further
on I came upon the tribe camped by a reedy lagoon.
Then I got the second shock that morning. Three
of the flapper gins had light brown hair, one almost
straw-colored. This tribe had seen white men for
the first time only two years before. Occasionally
I’ve seen light hair among the abos., but it
always turns black with age. I remember some of
the Bloomfield River (N.Q.) lads and girls growing
quite handsome light-brown hair, but in their case
I would not swear that the growth was natural.
Nigs, have much thicker hair than white men, and
a bald specimen is a great rarity. The lew I’ve
seen hare always worn cleverly woven skull-caps ot
human hair or of animal fur or birds’ feathers.
I’ve seen but one old bald gin, and she was just
a breathing human mummy. Also the abo. does not
grey till long after most of us poor whites do.
* " * * *
“Koolumarra” : “Morob” states that hfuman
beings as well as ani-
mals have a distinct
odor (B. 27/8/’25).
This reminds me.
Paddy Perkins, an abo.
once famous on the
Darling Downs (<).),
was shearing at Goom-
burra station. then
under the management
of the late J. J. Banks.
It had been a very wet
year, and the shearing
had in consequence
extended over a longer
period than Paddy
cared for. Several
times he approached
the boss with the re-
quest that he should
be allowed to pull oui,
but as he was a par-
ticularly clean shearer
and the old gentleman
liked his sheep well
shorn, he persuaded
Paddy to stop a while
longer. Eventually,
however, the walk-
about fever would not
be denied, and Paddy
put it to the boss in
front of all hands as
follows: “Look here,
boss. 1 like this shed
and I like the sheep
and you’re a pi urn
good boss, but I berry
sick, and if I don’t go
away pretty soon I die,
true —the stinkum
all you white feller
close up finish me soon.
I jus’ can’t stand him
any longer.” Paddy
got his tally.
“Slam”: Queensland boasts the “whistling
moth,” which gets busy just about sunset, when
most bird-enemies have gone to roost. The thin,
continuous whistle sounds like that of a young
cicada.- It comes from Ilecatesia fenestrata, a small
moth about lin. across the wings, prettily marked
in brown, white and reddish-yellow-. The sound
is evidently produced by the rubbing of the curiously-
shaped feelers against the hard ridges near the
shoulders—all insect calls are produced by friction
of some kind.
* * * *
“Tarago”: Toll “Pick” (B. 10/9/’25) that
the eel he saw- overlanding betw-een the McLaughlin
and Snowy may not have come directly, from either
river. When the water was cut off from the
Kooweerup Swamp area (Vic.), millions of black-
fish and eels were left stranded in depressions and
shallow pools. As these dried up the fish were
either caught or died from the want of moisture,
but the eels disappeared. For two or three years
it w-as common to dig them out of garden plots, and
THE THOUGHTS OF YOUTH.
“'Are if noticed, ’ Erbert, 'ow .soon our
childhood ambitions vanish?”
"Ar. I danno-I always wanted ter wear
long pants when I was a kid, and now
I bet I wear 'em longer than anyone.”
at a still later stage, when many of the farm
bloeks had been cleared and sown, I have seen
occasional slitherers making their way through the
grass towards the nearest water. My theory is
that they buried themselves in the mud like those
dug up, and the soil becoming too dry for them,
they made their way to the surface again and struck
out for more congenial surroundings.

THE LINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Across a strip of pasture land,
When washing-day is fine
I sometimes watch my neighbor’s wife
Hang garments on the line.
They billow out like sails of ships—
Old ships we used to know—
Great counterpanes and pillow-slips
And sheets as white as snow.
My neighbor’s wife is plump and fair,
And she’s a fruitful vine,
lor onewear-old to twelve-years-old
Have something on the line.
There father’s shirt and baby’s bib
Are waving fresh and clean ;
And romper up to dungaree,
With sizes in between.
The copper boils at eight o'clock.
The tubs are full at nine;
And ere the whistle goes at twelve
The clothes are on the line.
I see the hose of ev’ry shape
Flung out like nimble legs
Of dancers at a festival,
All straining at the pegs.
The little trousers seem to try
To run out into space,
And flay the air with hasty strides
That easily out-pace
The cotton tweeds, threadbare and patched-
The kind that workmen don—
While red-striped towels flick and crack
To urge the sprinters on!

Greatest of
All Essex Values
Greatest of All Essex Years
Built by Hudson, Essex not only shares the advantages of the famous
Super-Six patents, but also the value-building supremacy of their enormous
combined production* And the great Essex sales record is recognition ox
a value leadership so overwhelming that it is not even challenged#
The Finest Essex Ever
Only among far higher priced cars will you
find comparison for Essex quality, perform-
ance and riding ease. It is a totally differ-
ent type. It gives results no other car ever
gave. It is low priced, without disappoint-
ment in looks or reliability. It provides
stability and finest roadability without
unnecessary weight. It has economy with-
out sacrifice of performance.
You will enjoy driving it for the smooth
vibrationless performance of its quiet
motor. It is so easy to steer and comfort-
able to ride in that even over long journeys
and rough roads it gives a satisfaction
associated only with large costly cars.
In quality Hudson and Essex are alike.
The patents which account for Hudson’s
famous reputation for performance, reli-
ability and long life are responsible|for the
same qualities in Essex.
We believe it is the most economical car
to own and operate in the world.
After you have driven your Essex long
enough to require attention, you will find
repair and replacement costs so low as to
be almost incredible compared with the
charges that motorists are accustomed
to pay.
All of Hudson’s fifteen years’ experience
in manufacture and development of no-
table service standards are equally part of
your satisfaction in the ownership of an
Essex.
Surely you cannot be satisfied with less
than Essex offers, when its cost is but little
more than cars of the lowest price*
The COACH
The Hudson-Essex invention, and
more than four years’ development
of the Coach, of course, give it exclusive manufacturing
advantages in this type. No car at or near the price rivals die
Hudson-Essex Coach in actual proof ofvalue—which is SALES.

A CAUTIONARY MEASURE.
MOTHER: "Betsy, Eve told you often to count ten instead of losing
your temper, yet I found you sitting on Tommie's head.”
BETSY: "Yes, Mummi c—I was sit tin’ on his head so’s I’d have him
handy when I’d finished counting.”
that remarkable area made a point of being in
attendance at the homestead each morning at a
certain time, and they feasted to the full, returning
next day. To-day at Wingham Mrs. G. H. Buzzacott,
the wife of a retired police-inspector, has a school
of soldier-birds, black magpies, jackasses and smaller
fry. They get their morning meal at about the
same hour daily. One guest, to show appreciation,
and with full confidence in the future, has built
a nest over the back door of the Buzzacotts’ residence.
“Tamornie”: In New Guinea the term
“messalai” is applied to a small islet, a clump of
trees on a grass plain, a big tree in a clump of
scrub or a group of rocks. It signifies that a
spirit has taken up its abode there and the native
will not interfere with or intentionally damage
such places. Where messalai trees have been found
when clearing bush for a plantation the natives have
refused to cut them.
To demonstrate their
disbelief in anything
supernatural in con
nection with eertam
trees, three white men
of my acquaintance at
different times cut into
them. In each of the
cases the axeman was
severely injured by fall-
ing limbs, and one of
the number died. Near
the village of Bagum,
New Britain, is a mes-
salai island, surrounded
by a shallow reef. The
natives when passing
this place are extremely
careful not to strike
the bottom with their
paddles lest the mes-
salai be angry and de-
stroy them. At Bagum
the messalai is said to
take the form of a
snake, and in some
cases that of a pair
of snakes named Serina
and Anmdau respec-
tively, the latter be-
ing the male. A cape
named Kaut, near
Mumm, in the Eitape
district, is said to be
inhabited by a speci-
ally nasty devil much
respected by the
natives, and I once
greatly disturbed my
native crew by point-
ing at the cape when
asking questions about
it. This was said to
annoy the devil, and a
narrow escape from dis-
aster on the following-
night was attributed
to my doing so. Also,
while in the vicinity
of Kaut not a scrap of anything was thrown
into the sea, the crew even using cocoanut-shells to
spit into till well past the cape.

“Nitric”: Rats and mice, after devastat-
ing the wheat areas of the Darling Downs (Q.),
have now moved down to the sugar districts of
the Tweed River (N.S.W.), Recently at Murwil-
lumbah 15 tons of sugar-cane were destroyed on
one plantation. They are also attacking the ripening-
pineapple crops at Terranora. But it was reckoned
right over the odds when their menu at Warwick
included several golf-bags and dozens of balls stored
at the club house on the local links.
* * * *
“Bad Australian”: In the matter of kan-
garoo stalking (B. 10/9/’25), the point from which
the hunter makes his approach is of little conse-
quence compared with the manner in which the
jolt is done. I have shot thousands of kangaroos
and have never had
any great difficulty in
getting within easy
rifle range whether jn
calm or storm. In
wet weather or when
the dead sticks, twigs
and leaves were damp
I irequently got within
60 or 80 yards of the
animals, coining at
them from the most
convenient direction;
but when the weather
was warm and sunny
and everything under-
foot cracked, the
hoppers had to be ap-
proached very care-
fully to secure a range
of 200yds. According
to my experience kan-
garoos depend entirely
on hearing and sight
for protection. They
will often remain on
the feeding-ground
even after hearing the
approaching hunter;
but let them get one
glimpse of him and
they are away. The
successful kangaroo-
shooter must tread as
gingerly as a cat and keep well under cover when
out to kill.

“C.N.”: One liot summer’s day I was
driving a Lizzie from Yorketown to Minlaton (S.A.),
when I noticed on the road ahead a 3ft. snake
enjoying a sunbath. Having been told that the
correct way to kill snakes with a motor-car was
to run straight over them, taking care to put on
your brakes just before the rear wheels touched, so
that they would skid over the wriggler and so
break its back, I decided to give it a go. Every-
thing went according to programme. Then, as 1
stopped the car, 3ft. of snake landed in the seat
beside me. Evidently the bane of Eden, becoming
entangled in the spokes ot a wheel, had been thrown
#into the air to land in the car. The safest way
is around them.

More dingo destroyers :
“Sandy”: Strychnine salts are more soluble than
strychnine alkaloid, hence are more readily detected
by taste. When bicarbonate of soda is present, the
taste is further masked. Fat also prevents it be-
coming evident easily, and when the poison is mixed
with it good results are obtained.
“Ziak”: Take a shotgun, three short forks, a
rabbit-trap, 30yds. of No. 40 cotton and a short
piece of copper wire. Having found a pad where
the dogs run, set the forks up to cover it. Tie
the gun firmly in the forks with one at the middle
of the barrel, one at the grip on the stock and
the third at the butt. Set the rabbit-trap after
having tied the wire from the trigger to the jaws.
Then tie the cotton to a stake or tree and also
to the plate of the trap. Last of all, cock the
gun. This method is absolutely fatal to any animal
touching the cotton, the adjustment being so sensi-
tive that a cigarette dropped on the cotton will be
blown to pieces. Use cartridges loaded with No. 4
shot.
“Jarrah”: A farmer riding through his paddocks
found six dead sheep. He went home, got some
strychnine and a long-handled knife. He then
buried five of the sheep. After tying bags over his
boots he approached the sixth and, without touching
it with his hands, made a cut on the shoulder and
another on the hindquarter, dropping a few grains
of strychnine into each cut. That night he yarded
his flock and the next morning skinned the biggest
black dingo ever seen in the district.
“Two Seas”: Talking of keeping meal:
fresh in the bush during hot weather. I once pulled
up at an old shepherd’s camp for dinner, and, find-
ing he had fresh chops in the pan a fortnight
after his ration-carrier had called, I suspected him
of killing his own mutton. But he explained that it
was quite easy to keep meat fresh by partly frying
it and then packing it in tins and covering it
with hot mutton-fat. When the fat set without
any cracks the meat became hermetically sealed until
required. He showed me several large tins in which
he had his choice cuts embalmed.
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: The breed still holds good!
On a N.S.W. South Coast road a few weeks back I met
a team of 18 bullocks in charge of a driver who, when
I questioned him, admitted that he would be ten years
old on Boxin’ Day. I learned that when he and his father
had dumped their load of timber the previous day
Dad had celebrated the safe delivery by “going on the
tank.” The following morning the youngster yoked
the team by himself, got the old man into the wag-
gon, and was making for home when I met them.
The kid didn’t seem to think he was doing anything
unusual—it was all in the game.
* * * *
“X2X”: Some meteorologists are predict-
ing an unusually dry summer in 1926-27 ; there
are those who anticipate a drought over the greater
part of the world’s surface. There is plenty of
evidence to support the theory that certain changes
which take place in the sun bring fierce summers
at intervals of slightly over half a century. The
last two drought years in this cycle were in 1871
and 1816 ; in both years exceptional aridity occurred
with many unusual natural phenomena. In Eastern
Europe and Asia there were devastating famines
as a result, and in Western Europe conditions were
nearly as bad. America experienced the same visi-
tations ; the 1871-72 season w'as the driest since
the European occupation, and Australia did not
escape. Research further back shows that for almost
as long as records are available this 55-year cycle
has run as regularly as Halley’s comet.
* * * *
“Taiaha”: “Henry Pannikin’s” candidate
for the world’s luckiest man is not among the first
seven. A young motor-service driver named Coghill
is now sitting up and taking nourishment in fairly
solid form after a plunge in a 2J-ton limousine
over a sheer drop of 100 ft. into a rocky creek-bed
in the Waikari Gorge, on the East Coast of Maori -
land. His three companions in the car, a man, his
wife and his child, succumbed to their injuries. It
was the first serious accident in years of service-
car work over one of the most serpentine roads in
the world, and occurred at night, the victims
suffering 12 hours’ exposure in addition to the effects
of the crash.
* * * *
“Vosadina”: A harmless-looking millipede
seen all over New Guinea is, when fully-grown, about
7in. in length and fin. in diameter. Its color
ranges from burnt sienna to greenish. Underneath
the body are two rows of legs, which extend from
head to tail. It does not bite, but when disturbed
will often eject an acrid, burning fluid. Some time
ago in my sleep I must have disturbed one that
had crawled on my light arm, for on waking next
morning the skin was scorched, and my “boys”
maintained it was done by this polikeke. A miner
on Murua (Woodlark Island) some years ago was
closely inspecting one of them, when it ejected its
fluid into his eyes. He lost the sight of one
and the second was badly affected.
* * * *
“Biroobi”: I found a disabled jacky-
winter or ground-lark (are they one and the same?)
recently. The little sufferer had been knocked about
by other birds and left, half-blinded, crouching beside
a post. It had evidently been injured by accident
and then maltreated by feathered enemies, most
likely of a different variety. One wing was injured
and a leg broken. The break was padded with
dried mud. One could see the mud had* been applied
wet, as it formed a smooth and rounded lump
which secured the break fairly well. Had the bird’s
wing not been injured the leg would probably have
been allowed to get well; but the law of bird
land is to destroy the helpless.
•V * * *
“Lily-Beale”: At one or two places on
the Upper Darling may be seen the remains of the
Abo. maze traps once used for catching cod and
other fish. They were built of stones in shallow
places, in long, zigzag lanes, with blind alleys and
pockets at intervals. Fish wandered into them on
their way from one hole to another. Another trap
still in use in some places is a stake fence across
a narrow passage. Captain Sturt and his party,
when rowing up the Murray, came upon one of these
snares so neatly and ingeniously constructed that
rather than break it they turned back. In some
places the fence curved across the stream and had
a gap in the centre where a fishing net was set, or,
if the gap were sufficiently narrow, fishermen stood
at each side and speared the fish as they swam
through.
MODEL. DE LUXE.
"Hey, Willo, a bloke's snappin’ yer!”
“Yers, dreckly a fellow gets a new model
the newspaper blokes are after him.”
“Up North”: I’ve seen the teeth of old
abos. worn level with the gums, which themselves had
become so hard as to be almost the equivalent of
bone. I’ve also seen niggers’ skulls with the teeth
ground flat to the jawbone. The reason no doubt is
that a large amount of sand, ashes, etc., is chewed
with the food. Binghi throws the fish, meat or
roots on the red-hot coals, turning the grill over
when it browns on one side. He then claws it off,
only troubling to brush off the big cinders tflat adhere,
and wolfs the food to the accompaniment of crunch-
ing bones, charcoal, shell-grit and the sand on which
the fire is almost always built. The wonder is
that his splendid teeth last him as long as they do.
He takes no care to clean them, beyond the frequent
Use of a toothpick. Occasionally, however, I’ve seen
one vigorously rub them with a lump of soft-wood
charcoal.
THE BUSTED BUBBLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our paths through the mulga are hidden ;
The sands and the sun and the rains
Have robed the red lulls we have ridden,
And covered our trails on the plains.
The roofs of the townships that knew us
No longer ring loud with the mirth
We flung on the currents which drew us
In havens of plenty to berth.
When gold gleamed through jasper and rubble
In reefs where the values were high,
We sighted the old Busted Bubble
That watched over Linger and Die.
Her poppet-heads lifted so proudly
Above the hot roofs on the hill,
WJiile, pounding and thundering loudly,
The stamps of her ninety-head mill
Smote chords in the heart that enthralled us
Far more than the pulse of a band—
Woke echoes of promise which called us
To toil for the good of the land.
We flung off those burdens of trouble
Which galled us when famine -was nigh,
And signed on the old Busted Bubble
That flourished at Linger and Die.
We struck the old mine at her brightest,
The town in the joy of its prime,
When sorrow and labor were lightest,
And fleet was the passage of time.
We toiled in the stopes where the treasure
Gleamed fair when our candles were lit,
Our drills striking rhythmical measure
As into the sulphide they bit.
When called on we hurried to double
The output; and tallies were high
In days when the old Busted Bubble
Earned profits at Linger and Die.
How luring the grog in the shanties
At night when the pennies were flung!
How reckless the songs and the chanties
Of rovers warm-hearted and young!
We wore the good garments of fashion—
Loose flannels, blue trousers or moles;
Each hat was a billvgoat’s ration
And bluchers were thick in the soles.
These days we may fear that some pub’ll
Soon close, but they never ran dry
All night while the old Busted Bubble
Kept working at Linger and Die.
The old mill is silent. Long summers
Have smitten it, rafter and roof,
Since toilers and battlers and bummers
Abandoned it, padding the hoof
For camps that were ever out yonder
Beyond the last range in the haze—-
The farther afield, ah, the fonder
The dreams of their bountiful days!
Though barer than sheep-trodden stubble
Those hills where her smoke veiled the sky,
We still work the old Busted Bubble
That called us to Linger and Die.

Percentages of digestible crude
protein contained in the under-
mentioned foods.
The above diagram shows the comparative quantities of Digestible Crude Protein contained in the
foods mentioned. As protein is the element in a food which builds tissue, grows wool, repairs muscular
wear and tear, and which principally affects the secretion of milk, the value of Meggitt’s Linseed Sheep
Nuts as a food for sheep compared with other foods mentioned will be at once apparent.
In this respect, with maize at 5/3 per bushel, i.e., £lO/10/- per ton, the value of Meggitt’s Sheep Nuts
would be £4B per ton. The actual price in truck parcels is £1 1 per ton.
Further, the Sheep Nuts contain approx. 9° /c of linseed oil of a tonic, regulating and conditioning character.
This property overcomes all digestive derangements, improves the bloom and condition of wool, and
keeps flocks thrifty and lively.
The above reasons govern the fact that 2oz. Meggitt’s Sheep Nuts daily is an efficient ration.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
Legs, legs, legs! Legs of peaches and
legs that were merely peach-colored swarmed
on Randwick’s lawns. So many young legs on
old shoulders, so to speak, that you took
them all with a dash of mint-sauce unless
you met them face on. Legs are commend-
able and can be worn with equal decorative
effect, by the slim and the young; but no
frankly undieted lady over 40 should wear
them full-length. However, sleekly clad,
they gambolled even as the jocund daffodil
in the early part of Derby Day, but were
inclined to grow a little limp as the hours
wore on and the shoe pinched or the Tote
proved unkind. Of course there were other
thrills. There was the thrill of the tempera-
mental morning turning suddenly into a
smiling afternoon; there was the excitement
when punters found they had been let down
with “forged” race-books; there was Alan-
fred’s great moment when 70-odd thousand
—on him and off him —burst into a roar of
applause at his triumph; there was the sur-
prise of Boaster and Aletellus running a
dead-heat in the Epsom.
Flared skirts and wide hats, a tendency to
lacy interludes on the more fragile frocks
and a mad riot of horticulture, printed,
painted or embroidered on airy fabrics, will
be our summer raiment if Randwick on
Saturday is any indication. Red is per-
sistently asserting itself—some of the most
attractive dresses and sunshades were in
Venetian reds and cardinals. One gorgeous
sunray-dispeller was of rucked satin claret
in hue. But for becomingness mauves and
lettuce greens were as usual hard to beat.
Of the lilac clad, Cynthia Blair, fair and
slim, caught the eye; and Helen Stephen’s
georgettes of sealing-wax red made a brilli-
ant splash on the official stand.
The vice-regals fed a large group of the
mighty in law, war and medicine, and their
mid-day meal was enlivened by the persi-
flage of such as surgeon Alexander AlacCor-
mick and his lady, the Chief Justice Streets,
the Arthur Allens, the Herbert Alarkses, the
General Brand couple and a merry crew of
many others. Captain Coote aided and Air.
Penfold abetted the proceedings. The vice-
reine wore stately garb in leafy greens, and
her wide hat was daffodil as to crown and
black as to brim. Elaine was in blue, with
cascading vellum georgette making a pictur-
esque shoulder line. Browns and blacks were
the recurrent notes in the frockiug of the
other ladies in the vice-regal pew; the Alae-
Cormick lady’s hat, however, flew a feathery
plume of green, and Mrs. Spencer Brunton
went sumptuously attired in beige lace over
satin, often shrouded with a wrap of sable
georgettes. Joseph AVard’s lady from Alaori-
land was smart in black with a splash of
blue as deep in tone as the waters at Bal-
moral, and with her was her daughter,
Airs. Bernard Wood, from Christchurch,
darkly handsome under her Romney hat.
One of the handsomest frockers of the
day was Airs. Otway Falkner, who wore a
Queen Alary length frock of ivory marocain,
topped by a black crinoline of wide dimen-
sions ; another de luxe rig was Airs. John
Alagney’s mignonette-green embossings on a
white satin and georgette ground work. A
white suede coat greenly piped and a white
felt hat were other toothsome parts of the
whole. Airs. J. J. Smith (she’s a Mark
Foy offshoot) drew a rich whisper of blacks
and Persian blues through the day; and a
slim and elegant young man in floppy dove-
grey Oxford bags, a lavender waistcoat and
a jacaranda-blue shirt draped himself beside
a sturdy little Jack Tar, proudly conscious
that the Navy had “nothing on him” in the
matter of fancy bells.
The vice-reine and Colin Stephen’s lady
were the hostesses at large, so .to speak, of
Alonday; and in the Government House
party Clara Butt, magnificent in black tailor-
ings and opulent pearls, loomed large. Airs.
Pitt Rivers, too, very floral as to frock and
picturesque as to plumed hat, took a seat
among the vice-regals. Elaine de Chair and
Susan Spencer added youth and flapperish
pinks and whites to the group.
The Women’s Club reached the dizziest
heights of its social success the other day
when it housed a farewell to Lady Forster.
Like the jackdaw of old, though, it was
preening borrowed plumes, for the function
was really the National Council of Women ? s
party. In an atmosphere of roses and lilies
of Spring, the Governor-General’s lady was
greeted by Mrs. MacCallum, who reminded
her Ex. that her memory would be kept
green among us by the two great works to
which she has given her name—the Rachel
Forster Hospital for Women and the Rachel
Forster wing of the Infants’ Home. Mar-
garet Windeyer added her tribute. Lady
Forster, strewn about with outsize posies
(half the women’s associations in Sydney had
“said it with flowers”), garbed in blue vel-
vets and sables, made a response at once
sincere and impulsive.
Midway through last week the Ambas-
sadors nearly went soaring into the starry
night hitched to an aerial team of blue and
gold balloons. Straining at the leash and
hundreds strong, they billowed and bobbed
and almost persuaded the gold-leafed pillars
to leave their moorings and set out for the
open sky. The occasion, was the yearly
ball for St. Luke’s, and all the Very Best,
including Lady de Chair and Elaine, one-
stepped with fervor in the cause of the big
C. of E. hospital, which already suffers from
growing pains. Her State Ex, wore rai-
ment of mingled black and amber that
bloomed into a flowering border at its tunic
hem. Elaine’s gold tissue had a flare to its
skirt and a cape to its shoulder-blades.
Shirley Bavin was bound in blue and silver,
and came under the vice-regal wing with
Miss Bathurst, who is occupying the Govern-
ment House spare-bedroom at the moment.
Tall Aide Penfold gent-helped and John
Bavin and Mr. Chance were others in the
group. The Wade dame, who was president
of the ball committee, turned on mauve geor-
gettes with a cascade of opalescence.
Even the sight of a Sandow-developed
Adam and Eve listening-in to the serpent
failed to whip up girlish abandon at the
Black-and-white Artists’ Ball the other
night. All very well for Adam and Eve —
their woods weren’t filled with private de-
tectives, whereas at the Palais these Ish-
maels blew in and out with a sinister gaiety
that put the trumpets and the buzzers of other
artists’ balls out of action. A good-looking
Mercury and Diana were notable in a welter
of gollywogs, pierrots, Gaby dolls, sultans,
Spaniards, Egyptians and dozens of
hired-for-tlie-night outfits. A clever lady-
snail came out of her shell but humped it on
her back, and Ted Colies made an entranc-
ing curate. Four somewliat-drunk and a
suspected sneak thief were ejected. A. few
girls were all in front of themselves, as it
were, having no backs to their dresses from
shoulder to waist; but, feeling the eye of
the law on them, they populated the empty
spaces with a discreet smattering of beauty
spots. Sir Dudley and Lady de Chair came
about 9 and had the orthodox reception com-
mittee waiting on the mat for them, and
this was probably black-and-white artists
Cecil Hartt and Arthur Mailey’s debut as
vice-regal bowers-in. Elaine, with two girl
chums, Morna MacCormick and Aliss
Bathurst, added fluffy whiteness to the fox-
trotting whirl; the vice-reine, who presently
took the floor with her Viking, stuck to
black velvets glittersome with diamente.
The Rickard lady, who was of the commit-
tee, trailed rich black; the Penfold Hyland
couple had a night out; the mysterious “Air.
A” looked moodily about for the B and C of
the triangle; Alaud Fane came on after her
show; and Clarence Aloss, of the Children’s
Hospital, three-clieered everything, for it
was in the cause of the Camperdown insti-
tution that the artists suffered.

When this
Letter’s friend
looked her up
the other day
she was hang-
ing out sheets
on a sun-waslied green, her voice raised in
cheerful chant. It was a Mrs. Wiggs touch,
for this is what she sang—
Multiply our graces,
Chiefly love and fear,
And, dear Lord, the chiefest,
Grace to persevere!
The energetic and forceful Mrs. Phillips
Fox (Ethel Carrick) lias unpacked a great
collection of her husband’s paintings and
some of her own, and is stage-managing
the show at Horderns’ Gallery. Color
and light must have wakened in him some-
thing of the poet’s ecstasy. Green trees and
their shadows ; filmy curtains with the breeze
blowing through them, almost a seen thing;
exquisite interiors with a detail of still life
that only the initiate would dare; ladies
clothed in an aureole of red gold hair
reclining on lusli-green banks, and ladies
fully clothed with high neck bands and high
heels and sunshades stepping into pleasure
craft; a hill saturated with mystery and
fairy lore in the first breath of Spring—of
such is the art of Phillips Fox.
From a small boy running with proofs in
and out of the printing room of an Oamaru
paper “Chris” (John Christian) Watson
grew up into the first Labor Prime Minister
of Australia. Later he gave up politics, but
stepped into the eye of the camera once more
on Saturday when he took his second plunge
into matrimony. His old friend George
Walters secured the gyves at the Unitarian
Church, where Antonia Lane, of Westralia,
undertook “to be affectionate,” and “to en-
deavor to make the home bright and happy.”
In the afternoon sunshine of the first day
of October Quakeress Margaret Thorp de-
murely breathed her I wills, becoming there-
by the wife of Arthur Watts, formerly of
Manchester (Eng.). Both bride and groom
being of the Society of Friends, the ceremony
was performed in true Quaker fashion, the
actual knot-tying being done on the verandah
of Mrs. J. A. Jackson’s house at Killara.
Margaret flew the usual bridal vanities,
white satin, old-lace veil and everything.
There were no ’maids, but a group of young
women-friends surrounded the principal lady
during the crisis. The ’groom got through
with the help of Ken Jackson.
This will re-introduce Frances Fraser to
many old Sydney friends, for she was the
first Principal of the Presbyterian Ladies’
College at Croydon. She only left there to
follow the
luring gleam
of the Italian
lakes and the
blue song of
the Mediter-
ranean. With
the languages
of four of its
countries to
help her,
Europe opened
not only its
door but its
heart to her,
and steeped in
its glamor she
returned t o
Australia and
her old friend
th e P.L.C.;
but this time
it was th e
college in East
Melbourne
which claimed her talents. A few years
ago, Europe calling her again, Miss Fraser
set out on another pilgrimage, and it is
the loot of these travels that she is now dis-
playing- to an interested group in the rooms
of the Dante Alighieri Society.
St. Stephen’s pews from altar to porch
bloomed with white favors and tulle streamers
for the wedding of Mollie Fitzsimmons, of
Gordon, and George Broun, of Pymble. The
’groom’s mother was a AlcCathie,- and his
late father one of the directors of the Pitt-
street drapery firm, while the sprightly bride
is-"a daughter of Gordon’s M.L.A. The wed-
ding garment of ivory satin wore the new
flare on its skirt, and drew a satin train
that had a cuddlesome foundation of rucked
tulle and was misted over by Limerick lace.
An armful of outrageously beautiful orchids
was the finishing touch. Four maids in
lavender and silver added the scent of several
i bushels of deep red roses to the vibrating
atmosphere. The Wentworth, a bower of
flowers and favors, surrounded the cake cut-
ting, and here over a hundred guests were
entertained by the bride’s parents.
Pretty Muriel East (she’s the youngest
chick of one of The Bulletin’s oldest in-
habitants) stole lip the aisle of St Stephen’s
on Saturday night like a breath of grace to
keep her appointment with Dr. George
Elliott, of Carlton. Father’s arm supported
the bride in the lily-decked church, and two
graceful maids, sister Millie and Rene
Elliott, in cyclamen and silver, followed the
foamy wash of her ivory georgettes and
Brussels lace; while Patsy Mattison, like a
happy little fairy, led the way to the chancel.
Padres Campbell and Willis saw to the
riveting, and Mrs. Doyle, at the organ, and
Marjorie Leach, in song, cheered the princi-
pals over the last stages. There was much
joy later at Dungowan. where the bride’s
mother, in Parma violet georgettes and
silver-grey millinery, had to keep on explain-
ing to fresh acquaintances that she really
was the bride’s mother and not another sister.
Still later, after the new Mrs. Elliott had
been whisked off, sister Millie came into
the spotlight by announcing her engagement
to family-friend Trevor Rodgers.
The Australian-made Preference League
and the Housewives’ Association held tryst
together at the Assembly Room of the Edu-
cation Gallery the other afternoon. On
stalls surrounding the walls were an eye-
arresting display of cooking accessories and
pyramids of luscious-looking preserves,
while rugs and hats and silk stockings purred
from their various strongholds. Bagnall,
M.L.A., addressed the housewives, apparently
unconscious of the Berlei corset models that
posed to the right and the left of him on
the little platform.
Sydney Uni. Undergrads’ dance happens
on October 13 at the Palais Royal; and if
any man or woman needs a card now is
the time to speak. E. G. 11. Weekes and
11. M. Saxby are this year’s secretaries.
The Masonic Lodge of Balmain staged a
Made-in-Australia Preference Ball the other
night at the Town Hall, and produced 19
very good arguments. They were the debs.
*—l9 of them —pretty, bright-faced Aus-
tralian girls, and his State Ex. ushered them
across the threshold of the grown-up world.
Presented to Sir Dudley by the Mayoress
of Drummoyne, the lasses dropped their bobs,
not in a universal billow of girlish white,
for here and there the individual note of
blue, pink or mauve had been struck.
For two years past the Naturalists’ So-
ciety lias done its bit by natural history and
wild-flower exhibitions to help along an
interest in Australian flora and wild
life. This year its show will be held in the
Exhibition Hall of the Education Depart-
ment from October 8 to 14, and will include
exhibits representing practically every branch
of natural science.
Rhys Ivemmis’s bow sang its farewell to
Sydney last week, and the Town Hall was
filled with enthusiastic friends and fellow-
students. Rhys is another Royal Academy
scholarship holder from Golden Grove, and
though just a youngster her music has an
unexpected maturity. Yieuxtemps and Max
Bruch were the offerings, and the violinist
and Kathleen Fitzgerald, who played the
orchestral parts on a second piano, came out
of the ordeal shaken but victorious. Carrie
Lanceley and Arthur Benliam added their
art to the programme.
On Saturday afternoon, the 24th, Peter
Pan holds a party at the Palais to help
Tresillian, where so many of his pals are
put on the right road to grow up into sturdy
citizens. Peter Pan refused to grow up at
all, but you couldn’t blame him, seeing that
he had nobody to show him the Tresillian
way. Wendy is coming to the party; so
arc Captain Hook and Tinker Bell. And
a glittering pageant of fairy-tale people has
been arranged.
Sister Brisbane says there’s not much
doing;—
Greater Brisbane has arrived, and the old City
Council died on September 30. All kinds of things
are happening to the venerable Town Hall; the
carpenter, the plasterer, the painter and the deadly
plumber are at work transforming the'chambers and,
apparently, building hanging gardens for the new
order, Mayor Jolly having taken over the reins along
with the Tramways and the Botanic Gardens.
To finish up her job as Mayoress, Mrs. M. J.
Barry had a rose-colored tea at Lennon’s, where
poppies and sweet-pea played their part, and the
guests jazzed to the band. . Mrs. Barry wore tinted
mariette and ecru with a black hat ; Mrs. Gillies
was amongst the throng. In the morning the late
Mayoress had the Brisbane presswomen to tea in
the eastern lounge in a setting of amaryllis and sweet-
peas. Each guest found a gift at her plate and
a pretty message. Mrs. Young voiced the scribblers’
thanks.
Friends of the retiring Mayoress (Mrs. M. J.
Barry) met at Lennon’s in a setting of gerberas,
and over the friendly cup Mrs. Gillies presented the
guest of honor with a black and gold coffee-set, a
silver coffee-pot, jug and sugarbowl, a silver tray,
and a black morocco-encased travelling clock. Mrs.
Gillies wished her bon voyage on her trip to England,
and Mrs. Tom Ryan spoke of the help Mrs. Barry
had' always given to charities.
The Repertory Society arranged for Alice to sit
by the fire for two nights in the Theatre Royal.
Colleen Scott was Alice, Mary Macgregor’s brother
played Steve, Nell Graham scored as the old nurse,
and Jean Barlow gathered laurels as Amy, the Trundle
maiden running her close for honors. Good houses
greeted the newly-formed society’s second attempt;
it launched itself only this year on “The Dover
Road.”
Pauline Frederick went to stay with the Coochin
Bells after her season closed, and now she thinks
that Una Bell is one of the world’s best horsewomen.
His Majesty’s has closed doors at present, awaiting
the Butt-Rumfords.
James Gordon, of the Gowanbrae Gows, took Kit
\oung, of Symington, Clayfield, into his keeping in
the local Scots’ Church, which wore white lilies and
maiden-hair for the event. Arthur Sharman played
the organ, Mrs. Joyce sang an “Ave” and “Entreat
Me Not to Leave Thee,” and the bride wore silver
tissue. Garth Billington’s wife lent the point-lace
veil, and attended as matron of honor, while little
Joan Longwill, in white satin, with a pink tulle cap,
was bridesmaid. A pink and silver color scheme
received the feasters at Symington, where Mrs.
Young' hostessed in black mariette.
Mrs. Bruche goes with her General to Sydney next
January, and General Brand, the Commandant there,
passes on to the Defence Council in Melbourne. Mrs.
Bruche has been connected with the Red Cross
Society and the Bush Book Club, and was a member
of the Standing Committee of the Women’s College.

Flags are being laundered for the street
decorations which are to flutter for the
coming of the new Governor-General on
October 8. A retinue of servants (imp.)
have for the past week been installed at
Government House, so the kettle will be on
when the vice-regals arrive.
A garden party that had to turn itself
into something else was the final entertain-
ment of the Forsters at Federal Government
House. The scene was nicely set for the
open air, with the G.-G. and his lady on
the lawn, and the handshaking had begun
when came a shower of rain. The vice-
regals fled to the ballroom, and the thousands
streamed after them —such a medley rub-
bing shoulders, from the strawberry-leaves
of the English Press party (these were sup-
posed to be the guests of honor) to the very
’umblest local walker, all scrambling to say
au revoir. Somebody estimated that about
a thousand more than had been bidden
passed the eye of the Air Force at the por-
tals —perhaps it had been told not to be too
exacting. Dressing was chiefly of the last
rose, of winter variety, though a few- daring
women aired spring attire, and shivered;
mere man was frock-coated and bell top-
pered, uniformed, or just sac-suited, accord-
ing to position or purse. Lady Forster said
good-bye in a flounced frock and millinery
of art-blue. Lady Burnham was in brown,
Lady Apsley in a smart fawn coat over a
check suit, and Lady Violet Astor in black
and feathered millinery. The Chief Jiistice
and his lady, and the Mayor and his lady—
she in black with gold flowers on her cha-
peau—were in the scrum; also James Con-
nolly, formerly Agent-General for AVestra-
lia, and daughter Cassie in spring clothing
of black georgette splashed with pink roses.
Miss Gillette, an advance representative of
the Stonehaven menage, was there making a
few mental notes.
The first celebration in honor of the wives
of the visiting Press people was held in
camera. The Madames of the Ministers of
the Commonwealth arranged the function,
which ran to a bit of bird and a bottle of
wine at Menzies’. The party finished the
ewening at “No, No, Nanette.” First of the
feminine vanguard to arrive at half-past
8 included Mrs. S. M. Bruce, Lady ATolet
Astor, Lady Apsley, Mrs. Hugh D. Mclntosh
and Mrs. Lauchlan Mackinnon; and eventu-
ally all the yawning vacancies in the dress-
circle were occupied.
The civic reception to the visiting Press
people was a sort of continuous feast, with
toasts and speeches punctuated by the sing-
ing of Viola Morris and Joseph Foster.
Thirteen sat at the official table, and defied
the Fates. The gowning was good, and well
set off against white walls and banks of gor-
geous cinerarias, bamboos and palms. The
Mayoress was in a robe of golden hue; Lady
Burnham was a Rhine maiden in green that
had a regular coat-of-mail in glistening beads
and pearls; slim fair-haired Lady Apsley
was a study in ruby georgette and
beads; and most of Lady Violet Astor’s
frocking was hidden beneath a pink and
silver brocaded coat with facings of ermine.
Mrs. A. AAV Moore (Eve Adam), much
approved of by local women journalists, had
gold beads embroidering pale green robing.
Mrs. Eden, who has the good looks of the
party, contrasted tvonderful diamond ear-
rings against black apparel. Sydney added
some fine upholstery, Mrs. J. O. Fairfax
quite holding her own with the titled from
overseas.
Lady Burnham, in an ensemble suit of
brown fancy satin topped by a lilac-hued
and flower-decked hat, went to morning-tea
at the Lyceum Club. Over the beverage the
lady delivered some seusible remarks upon
the bringing-up of girls, which caused the
present generation to scoff sotto voce and
the young-that-were to applaud. President
Mrs. J. G. Latham, who did the honors,
thanked the titled visitor for the informal
and informative words.
Lady Stradbroke entertained the trio of
women delegates to the Empire Press Confer-
ence at a luncheon at the Oriental Hotel,
what time his Excellency fed the men at the
Hotel AVindsor. Other functions included a
stag dinner at Government House on Wed-
nesday and a reception the same night,
Viscountess Burnham assisting in the liand-
grasping rites. Most of the womenfolk of
politicians came unattached. Premier Allan’s
wife was there in black georgette glistening
with bugle beads; Alec Peacock’s lady wore
ecru lace and georgette; Archbishop Har-
rington Lees and the just-arrived Bishop
Taylor Smith, late Chaplain-General of the
British Forces, were imposing in dull purple
and buckled shoes. Sir Harry Brittain,
John Monash, Rear-Admiral Hall Thompson
and his lady, the American Consul and Mrs.
Anderson (frocked in black with attach-
ments of gold) were some of the others.
The English-Speaking Union was much
to the fore during the week of the Press in-
vasion, and managed to catch several large
fish for a luncheon at Scott’s Hotel and a
tea (with speeches) the next afternoon.
President Donald Mackinnon did the honors
at both functions, chief guests at the mid-
day meal representing Britain (the Astor
pair), Maoriland (George Fenwick), Canada
(J. AAV Dafoe), India (A. AAV Moore), S’Africa
(B. K. Long) and Scotland (J. R. Find-
lay). Nobody disputed anything, not even
Scotchman Findlay’s asseveration that the
best English was spoken in Inverness; so
the only bone picked was the poultry’s.
Official guests were not all dumped down
at the one table, and the very sensible pro-
cedure was happily followed at the after-
noon reception, for which the big dining-
hall was decorated with hanging baskets of
ferns above tea-tables, with the loveliest wild
pink heath amid the eatables. Duties of host
Avere shared by president Donald Mackinnon,
Mrs. Mackinnon, Mrs. Bruce and the Allen
dame. The surprise of the gathering was the
rattlingly good speech made by Lady Violet
Astor. The success of the two shivoos was
mainly due to the combined efforts of the
secretary (Richard Gipps) and his wife, who
as Alys Kirkland was a popular elocution-
ist at charity shows in Brisbane.
The news-sellers and their attached women-
folk wandered in one of Melbourne’s famous
private gardens on Thursday afternoon, when
the Miller dame extended her own and the
A T ictoria League’s welcoming hand at her
Toorak home. Edward Miller, knight, and
son Studley lent their aid. Perfect weather
enabled visitors to have a close-up of green
lawns with beds of purple violas and of
Japanese plum and peach trees that were
masses of bloom. The Governor and Lady
Stradbroke graced the party, she in a black
cloth gown and felt millinery and daughter
Helena with a black picture hat topping a
black fancy satin coat. The hostess wore
black fringed attire, with biscuit-hued lace
lightening a black feathered hat. The over-
seas and Sydney contingents were reinforced
by, among others, Mrs. Lovekin, of W.A., in
a steel-beaded black frock; she brought her
daughter.
Vandyck here presents the wife of George
Tallis, who shares with her bekniglited hus-
band, of the
J.CAV. firm,
e x ceeding
popularity and
has earned it.
A sister of the
lamented Flor-
ence Young,
she has the
same talent for
drawing bi g
houses; but
she does it as
organiser o f
charity func-
tions. AVith her
co - worker
Mrs. W. M.
Robins, she
has raised
much money
for Queen Vic-
toria Hospital;
and now she is
including St.
Vincent’s Hospital in her interests. She is
largely responsible for the matinee which is
being given at His Majesty’s on October 22
for this institution’s appeal. George Tallis
secretaries the show.
AA 7 eather that ran the gamut of the seasons,
finishing up at afternoon-tea time with a
burst of summer, caused the V.R.C. races at
Flemington on Saturday to present dressing
that was chiefly wintry, with a stray spring-
hat in attendance. The crowd was large and
cheerful —to begin with. Governor Strad-
broke was there to se the defeat of his
champion; and Lady Carr, Captain and
Mrs. Anthony Eden and other members of
the visiting press party were among the
sports. Most interest centred in the Heroic-
Night Patrol encounter, and the fiery Fuji
San’s beating of the favorite Heroic caused
a demonstration like that which greets an
umpire’s unpopular decision at a local foot-
ball match.
On Saturday sculptor AA'eb Gilbert met
the only opponent he was not able to over-
come in the 56 years of his fight against
difficulties. Starting work in a kitchen, he
was soon chef in Parer’s Cafe; but he
refused to be side-tracked from his art, and,
joining the classes at the National Gallery,
he, studied drawing and painting. In his
few spare hours he worked like a tiger, and
having sucked the orange of color, the
fascination of clay drew his facile fingers.
So he became a sculptor, and as far back as
3897 his “Vintage Offering” was shown at
the Yarra Sculptors’ Society Exhibition.
Not until 1914 did he succeed in reaching
London. Just then the Powers had decided
to stage their big drama, so Web enlisted as
a munition-worker. About this time “The
Critic” was bought by the nation under the
Chantry Bequest, and is now in the Tate
Gallery in London. After the Armistice he
was kept busy, and a dozen busts, numerous
war memorials and the Flinders statue are
among the good things by which Australia
will remember him.
Some 1600 Girl Guides massed on Satur-
day in the grounds of Federal Government
House for the first general rally since 1922.
Lady Stradbroke, in uniform with the silver
cockade of State Commissioner, took the
salute; she was attended by daughter Helena
and State-Secretary Sybil Irving; his Ex.
was an interested spectator of the march
past to the music of the Air Force Band.
First-aid, physical exercises, team games
and country dances on a daisy-spangled lawn
completed the programme. Incidentally the
State Commissioner decorated Jean Kelso, of
the AVannon Company, with a Silver Cross
for bravery in saving two people from drown-
ing.
Mrs. Lane-Poole, wife of the Forestry
Adviser of the Commonwealth Government,
is a woman of
parts. House-
decoration and
exqui s i t e
need leeraft,
literature and
water - color
painting are
with her more
than merely
good side-lines.
D i c k i nson-
M oute ath’s
camera has
caught the
lady’s bright
expression, but
couldn’t repro-
duce the de-
lightful brogue
that came all
the way from
Dublin —she is
a cousin of poet
AV. B. Yeats,
and Lily Yeats taught her her two first-
named accomplishments. The lady intends
to follow her profession here. Edward P.
carried back to England a sample of Mrs.
Poole’s work in the wooden casket designed
by her and presented by the AVestralians.
The Women’s Automobile Club made a
regular blue-and-silver carnival of its annual
dance at St. Kilda Town Hall. Mrs. li.
Fitcher, who one-stepped in powder-blue
draperies, was responsible for the table
decorations; a wee silver auto freighted
with lupins marked the official stall. Presi-
dent Mrs. H. J. Robertson danced in a
gown of emerald green satin ; the Mayoress
of St. Kilda (Mrs. Cummings) came in
black charmante with gold lace etceteras;
Mrs. Jim Angus covered black frocking with
a huge black shawl brocaded in gold roses ;
Mrs. Gutmann had wonderful bead embroid-
ery upon a petunia georgette robe; Marie
Burke, in galah plumage of bright green with
alike feather trimming, dropped in after the
theatre; and Mrs. Cox (Royal Auto. Club)
was in royal blue and silver —-a neat compli-
ment to the rival club.
The Liedertafel has just put up its cen-
tury in concerts at the Auditorium; and in
honor of the event President Jimmy Dyer
and Mrs. Dyer entertained conductor Mans-
ley Greer, performing members and the
night’s soloists at an after-concert supper at
the Lyceum Club.
Madame Mary Conly (Mrs. J. Jarrett)
had a “silver wedding” party on September
25. Pupils and friends assembled at her
studio on the evening of the happy anniver-
sary, with Dr. Charles Strong as spokesman,
and handed over mementoes —a Blackwood
tea-waggon, a silver salver and vase, and
some gifts, too, from friends in Sydney. As
a concert artist, and particularly in oratorio
work, Madame Conly helped to put Australia
on the map long ago: she is almost as well
known in London’s Royal Albert Hall as in
Melbourne. She has sung “opposite” Sant-
ley, Ben Davies, Andrew Black and such
stars; she has been on programmes with
Clara Butt, Kreisler, Jean Gerardy, Kirkby
Lunn, and lots more luminaries. Among her
special triumphs was her singing of the
soprano part of Sir Villiers Stanford’s
“Stabat Mater” on its premidre at the Royal
Albert Hall.
Adna Millicent Butler, elder daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. AValter Butler, of Toorak, has
married her cousin, John Henry Butler, of
Wiltshire (Eng.). St. John’s, Toorak,
which housed the ceremony, was all deco-
rated with peach blossom and pink ribbon
bows. The bride’s finery was white silk
crSpe, bugle-beaded, with veil of Limerick
lace falling over a train of cloth of silver.
The attendant maid, Phyllis Blaxland, of
Sydney, wore a frock of pink, feather trim-
med; gold lace and pink georgette swathed
her locks. Hope and Stephen Howard were
wee trainbearers, she a vision in pink, with
a wreath of flowers. The wedding supper
was served at Studley, the bride's mother
wearing silver and mauve lame beneath a
wrap of grey chiffon velvet.
When Mollie Burston, youngest daughter
of Mrs. J. Burston, of Toorak, said "I will
to Dr. Guy Tendon, of Adelaide, at St.
John’s, Toorak, she robed herself in golden
brown needle-run lace through which glim-
mered gold lame, topped by picture millinery
of gold crin. straw and roses; and she car-
ried more yellow blossoms. Judith Burston
and Mollie Murray, frocked in pink geor-
gette, with pink and blue flowers upon early-
Victorian Tuscan hats, saw auntie through.
The bride's father, the late Major-General
James Burston, sat in Melbourne’s mayoral
chair for some years. The reception, at
which 200 guests were feasted, was at Carn-
cal. Toorak, the home of bride's brother
Stanley.
Ethel Eulalie Clare White, of the Hum-
phry Bishop co., gave her promise to Norman
Johns, of the same theatrical enterprise, the
other day, at St. Philip's, Collingwood.
After-rejoicings were held at the Colling-
wood Town Hall, where Mr. and Mrs. AN.
White, the bride’s parents, entertained many
guests.
Maggie Moore's stage friends are uniting
to give her a . oyal send-off with a kingly
cheque at IBs Majesty’s on the 13tli. Fifty
years ago Maggie came here in “Struck
Oil,” and, incidentally, laid the foundation
for the fortune of the Arm of J.C.AV. ; a
scene from the old money-making drama is
in the programme. The dear woman goes to
her home-town, San Francisco, to live with
her sister; and —who knows? —we may see
her yet in the movies.
The revival of “A Royal Divorce” at the
Royal on Saturday set some memories hark-
ing back to the fascinating Julius and the
Josephines that were. Puffed sleeves, high
waists and lengthy skirts made a pleasant
change from models of the moment; Muriel
Starr dreamily trails some nice gowns, in-
cluding a light blue brocaded taffeta opening
over an underdress of paler hue, and a scarf
of Maltese lace with a crimson feather wan-
dering across the front of her hat. For her
farewell to Napoleon she wears an ermine-
edged royal blue cloak with a glimpse of
lemon-colored satin frock beneath; the lace-
draped black wig is so devoid of gloss that it
suggests a purchase at the wool-counter.
Floie Allan is graceful in floral silk dresses
and coalscuttle bonnet; and as the Empress
Marie Louise, Mildred Cottell contrasts flam-
ing red hair with a gown in shades of purple
and mauve.
Edna Thomas, in early-Victorian apparel
of plumbago blue with a wealth of lace and
flounces, began a return season at the Athe-
meum on Saturday. Governor Stradbroke,
Lady Stradbroke, in black velvet and tulle,
daughter Helena Rous and Captain Keppel
Palmer occupied a box. Opposite were
General Chauvel and his lady, the latter in
a glistening jade-blue frock; and Lord
Apsley with his lady in ivory crepe de Chine.
Some beautiful Chinese robes are to be
worn next week at the performance of “The
Mandarin Coat” by the Melbourne Rep. at
the Playhouse. The play is written by that
bright amateur actress Isabel Handley, of
this city, and Mrs. Apperly will play lead.
A word from Adelaide: —
Ethel Barringer, well known as a teacher and
for her hand-wrought metal work and paintings,
is to have her memory perpetuated by an Ethel
Barringer prize at the School of Arts and Crafts.
The Elder Hall was all abloom with poppies for
the last frivol that the University Dance Club will
hold this season. Illness kept Mrs. T. G. Osborn
away—her husband is the club's president—so Mrs.
Harold Davies helped him do the honors. The affair,
by the way, resolved itself into a species of birth-
day party for him; and an item of the supper-
table was an enormous birthday cake.
The Old Scholars of the Wilderness School have
had their annual dance, with Alleyne, the Fred
Downers’ daughter, as its secretary ; and on the
same evening there was jazzing at the Glenelg Maison
de Dance to raise funds for sending Marjorie Bonnin
to study eurhythmies in London. A. committee two
dozen strong, headed by Mrs. H. C. Cave, managed
the latter show, and ran it excellently.
A day as uncertain as Scott’s woman took the
edge off the sartorial glories of the Hunt Club’s
meeting, and the lawns showed anything from flimsy
georgette to stern tailor-mades and opulent furs.
Officialdom was represented by the Clovers, she in
black, with a hint of lace about the frock that
showed beneath her coat. Mrs. Frank Whyte, whose
husband is the Club's president, w r as black-clad, too,
with upstanding ribbons in her hat.
Jean Robertson had a special welcome when she
limped on to the stage on the first night of the
“Outsider,” and the amateurs who have played with
her here are feeling some reflected glory. Enter-
prising “unregistered” practitioners have seized on
the play as an excellent advertising medium for
their own methods; hence a word from Moseovitch
after the final curtain that he has no propaganda
purpose in staging it.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The 1925 A.J.C. Derby had some of the
elements of a Nat Gould novel. Thirty-six hours
before the race, ruffians, using a file on the lock,
tried to get into Manfred’s stable with the inten-
tion of nobbling him. Had they succeeded in their
purpose (the noise awoke a stable-boy and they
took to their heels), the 80,000 people who went to
Randwick on Saturday would have witnessed a
stodgy race among third-raters, instead of about the
most exciting Derby on record. Manfred, who was
5 to 2 on in the ring (and 2 to 1 on in a two-divs.
grandstand tote from which 12 i p.c. and fractions
of sixpences were deducted), looked a champion
among commoners as the seven starters formed into
line. But when the barrier went up, he skipped
along under the webbing from the rails position to
the outside, instead of going forward with the
others. He was 60 or 70 yards behind the last of
the bunch when Duncan, after momentarily hesitating,
got him going. Fortunately, the pace was unusually
slow —it took Hampden, the leader, to run
the first furlong, and even then the field was strung
out —and. amidst gathering excitement, the bay colt
steadily reduced the gap. At the mile post Hampden
was still leading from Avrom, Tibbie, Amounis and
Petunia, with Manfred rapidly gaining on Vaals, the
second last horse. Presently a great roar announced
that Manfred had caught the other Valais colt, and
at the half-mile post the bay was alongside Amounis,
the second favorite ; three furlongs from home he was
racing for the lead. There was thunderous cheering
when he entered the straight in front of Amounis,
Hampden and Petunia, and disposing in a few strides
of Amounis, who made a run at him on the rails,
he went on to win by a length and a half and to
get the greatest reception ever given to an Australian
racehorse since Carbine’s Melbourne Cup. Amounis,
who started at 5 to 2, failed badly over the last
furlong and was beaten for places by Petunia (25’s)
and Tibbie (33’s), who was a length and a quarter
behind The Welkin’s son.
The official time was 2min. 35} see., the slowest
since 1916. Newspapers credit Manfred with having
really registered 2min. 28jsec., but this assertion
is not to be taken seriously. According to Duncan’s
own statement, he didn’t bustle his mount over the
first half-mile, and a colt that can gallop 12 furlongs
in 2min. 28 j sec., and that with Bst. 101 b. on his
back, without being at his top for a third of the
distance, has yet to be foaled. Left as he was,
Manfred could not have triumphed had his opponents
been a f.a.q. Derby lot travelling at an average
Derby pace. It was his good fortune, and that of
his party, that the others were third-raters, with
not a stayer among them. He has abundantly demon-
strated that he is good and game—far and away
the best three-year-old of a bad year—but before
he can be regarded as a real champion he will have
to avenge the defeat inflicted on him at Rosehill
by The Hawk, and beat Windbag in the Melbourne
Cup or at w.f.a.
The Epsom race was also exciting in its way.
There was such a demand for Honan that he firmed
from B’s to 3’s and 5 to 2, and punters could
be heard complaining that certain apologies for
bookmakers who are permitted to waste jspace
that could be usefully occupied by a straight-out
tote would not lay the English chestnut. Baldwin
was firm at B’s, and Pantheon and The Hawk
shortened to that figure, while Boaster and Metellus
were at 10’s. Red Gauntlet at 12’s, Irish Prince at
16’s and Blackadder at 20’s, 25’s to 100’s being
offered about the other 13. Valiard was the first
to jump out, and Metellus. Baldwin. Boaster and
The Hawk also began briskly, while Honan’s white
jacket was prominent for a time. Valiard led into
the straight, with Metellus alongside, but the New-
market horse soon squibbed it, and Metellus hit
the front, to be resolutely challenged on the rails by
Boaster. The pair fought out a great finish, nothing
else being in the picture, and the judge could not
separate them—the first Epsom dead-heat. Sir
Alick (50’s), who was never sighted till, the last
furlong, beat Hit for third place, and Irish Prince,
Bard of Avon, Quan Tart and Baldwin followed them
home, the time being lmin. 37Jsec. With an
uninterrupted preparation, Boaster would have been
a good thing, but William Kelso did well in getting
him to the post in the condition that he exhibited.
The black gelding, who is by Magpie—Galtee
Princess, was ridden by Munro, while Duncan steered
Metellus (Valais —Averse), who is trained by Holt
for the Victorian C. B. Kellow, though McGalman,
trainer of Manfred and Whittier, had him in hand
during his Randwick sojourn. Honan got into a
scrimmage at the home turn, and that was the end
of him. Red Gauntlet, who is also trained by
Kelso, looked a likely winner for a , time, but the
last furlong found him out. Those who stuck to
him got their money back with interest on the
second day, when he won the Kensington Handicap
brilliantly with lOst. 101 b. up; and Baldwin also
repaid his followers in the Grantham Stakes for
four- and three-year-olds, in which, meeting Sum
King, Tibbie, Triplex, Avrom and Bravery practically
on weight-for-age terms, he made the three-year-old
form, apart from Manfred, look very cheap.
* * * *
The betting on the Spring Stakes was 7 to 4
on Windbag, 5 to 1 Pilliewinkie, 7’s Spearfelt, B’s
Whittier, and 16's to 33’s the other three. Spear-
felt’s comparatively long price was the result of
an indifferent gallop on Thursday morning, and he
showed no dash whatever. Nor did Pilliewinkie
ever threaten danger, although he earned third money
for Samuel Hordern. On the other hand, Whittier,
who hadn’t galloped a mile and a half for nearly
two years, raced alongside Windbag for nearly three
furlongs, and, though beaten in the end by two
lengths, was by no means disgraced, especially as :
the solid and reliable Windbag completed the journey
in 2min. 31fsec. Windbag’s win was worth £lB3O
to Robert Miller, for whom Boaster had already landed i
£1798 10s. Ben Chaffey’s cheque for first in the :
Derby and second in the Spring Stakes, amounted 1
to £7023, and it would assuredly have been in- )
creased if he had not sent Manfred and Whittier :
back to Victoria after the first day.
A field of 20 contested the Metropolitan Handicap,
but its quality may be judged. from the fact that
Polycletan was a close third with 9st., top weight.
THE CRUMB OF CONSOLATION.
PROSTRATE One: “ Any'ow, ole L evy can't roar at me now for not givin ’ the ’orse ’ees

whereas he was all out to win a year ago with 7st.
41b. And the six-year-old Polycrates gelding is
no better than he was a year ago—probably not
as good. Virgin Gold was favorite at 9 to 2,
Friarsdale, Strongbow and Frances Tressady being
bracketed at B’s, while 10’s were offered about Kiga,
12’s Royal Roue and Hit, 20’s Solidify, 25’s Bard of
Avon and 33’s Polycletan. Hit made most of the
running, with Solidify, Kiga and Bard of Avon
handy, but he had done his dash at nine furlongs,
and Solidify turned into the. straight with a good
lead. At the distance Solidify was fighting it out
with Kiga, but weight told on the Lavendo colt,
who is only a little fellow, and Kiga failed to stay;
and presently both were passed by Bard of Avon,
Frances Tressady and Polycletan. Bard of Avon
finished best and defeated the mare by a length, with
Polycletan a neck away and Solidify a close fourth;
Chancellor, Mirthmaker, Kiga and Royal Roue were
the nearest of the others, and the time was 2min.
45 3-5 sec. Bard of Avon, a solidly built chestnut
colt by Urney—Belle of Avon, is trained by veteran
Joe Tomlinson and was ridden by J. Brown, who
used to be Tomlinson’s apprentice; the owners are
J. and J. F. Leitch, who collected £5374, apart
from wagers. All the short-priced horses ran badly
except Frances Tressady, who had a rough passage
and proved herself a very game Tressady indeed.
So far four-year-olds have been uncommonly suc-
cessful. At the end of the second day they had
won all the flat races for which horses of their age
were eligible. Dead-heat for first, and third in
> the Epsom; first in the Spring Stakes; first in the
Metropolitan; first and second in the Trial Stakes;
the same in the Squatters’ Handicap; first, second
and third in the Shorts; first in the Grantham Stakes
and first in the Kensington Handicap—such was
their truly remarkable record.
“Hambone”: Sydney owner Ned Moss watched
the finish of the A.J.C. Derby with mixed feelings.
At the 1924 yearling sales at Randwick, he asked a
trainer to pick him a Valais colt that might develop
into a Derby winner. The trainer selected one, and
Moss made a note of the lot. When the Valais
draft entered the ring, Moss secured the colt he bid
for at a figure much below the 2000 guineas he
was prepared to give. The following lot went for
1400 guineas. When his adviser saw Moss’s purchase
he hit the sky. Moss had bought the wrong one,
as he found when he consulted his note again. The
colt that Moss should have bought, and which brought
600 guineas less than he would have given, was
Manfred. The colt Edward did buy was Vaals, who
was toiling down the straight when Manfred was
home and dried.
Heroic gave his Caulfield Cup backers
another nasty jolt in the V.R.C. October Stakes, for
which he was 10 to 9 on. It was I'eckoned that the
long stretches at Flemington would suit the chestnut
better than The Night Patrol (10 to 9 against), who
had beaten him easily at the Valley; and the
chances of Mercian King (16’s) and Fuji San
(20’s) were not seriously considered, even by their
stables. Heroic and Fuji San both behaved admir-
ably at the barrier, and soon after the start The
Night Patrol was in front, with Heroic just behind
him, alid Fuji San third. The two leaders turned
into the straight together, and it looked as if
Heroic was going to come right away. However,
the chestnut went across to the centre of the
course, and Fuji San, dashing through on the
rails, won as he liked by two lengths—it could have
been a dozen —from the favorite and Mercian King. The
Night Patrol died right out, and Arendal beat him
for fourth place. Fuji San’s performance was a
puzzling one, as he had run last the Saturday before
at Moonee Valley; however, inconsistent or not, he
made Heroic look like a down-the-line performer.
He is trained by O. Hodson for J. P. Arthur and
has Bst. lllb. in the Caulfield Cup, in which he
looks like running a great race. Tookarby (Bst.
21b.), who had run second to Manfred in the
Heatherlie Handicap at Caulfield last month, was
always favorite for the Stand Handicap, 10 fur-
longs. going out at 3 to 1, with Royal Charter second
choice at 11 to 2 against, and All Sunshine, King of
Mirth and Susie Pve at 8 to 1. Pluto (15’s) and
Ilanchani (25’s) were in front early, and the latter
led into the straight, but, running out wide, let
King of Mirth through on the rails. The
Corned}' King horse was in the lead at the distance,
and looked like winning easily, but had to be ridden
hard to beat Royal Charter, who had met with
trouble, by half a head, -with Pluto a neck away
third. King of Mirth, who is trained by L. J.
McCann for R. E. Hope, of Adelaide, has Bst. 31b.
in the Caulfield Cup, and Royal Charter the same
weight, but the latter’s mission is generally sup-
posed to be the Melbourne Cup. He finished very
strongly, and was unlucky to lose. Noscitur was
fourth, and Bolet Satan, who is making a hobby of
it, last. The Maribyrnong Trial Stakes for colts
(4| furlongs) brought 24 youngsters to the post,
and they looked a pretty good lot. Sarpedon (Sar-
chedon-Capella), a grey who went out at s’s, won
nicely by half a length from Trevlon (Cyklon—
Trey), with Winning Ticket third and Donace a close
fourth; time, 55Jsec. The winner is trained by-
Sid Ferguson for J. P. Govet. A smai't-looking filly
in Welitha (The Welkin—Talitha), trained by Jim
Scobie, -was made a hot pot for the fillies’ division,
but the winner turned up in Gladys Lillian (Swift
Flight—Cherry Roe), who started at twenties, with
Bright Star and Dueness of Blankney second and third.
Gladys Lillian, who is trained by S. Cusdin for N.
Narmorg, clipped a quarter of a second off Sarpedon’s
time. Kaiwarra (9st. 111 b.), who had spread-eagled
a field at Moonee Valley the previous Saturday, was
the medium of a plunge in the six furlongs Paddock
Handicap, starting favorite at 2to 1. He won easily,
u-if'i George Harrison on top, from Vinstra and
Shaheen.
“Petrie”: The oldest inhabitants of the
Queensland turf are clerk-of-course Ike Moonev
and his horse Darky. Ike has been working for the
Q.T.C. for 35 years—for the last 17 years as clerk
of course; and he has been clerk of course at Albion
Park for 16 years. Before that he was for many
years ringmaster at the National Show. Ike lias
ben riding Djarky for,well over 20 years. How old
the horse is nobody knows, but he was somewhere
about voting age when Ike ptit him into training,
and that was before the war. Darky (raced as
Enmore) could reel off four in 53 any morning on
the track, but he knew too much about the game
to have any ambition to shine as a racehorse.
Started at Albion Park, he refused to leave the
barrier, and at Sandgate he ran off the course. But
the ancient can still raise a gallop, and at times
he is as frisky as a two-year-old. All he needs
to make him as good as new is a set of false teeth.
* * * *
Another newspaper reputation went up in
smoke at Melbourne Stadium when Eagel Thomas,
a negro feather from the States, was thoroughly
pasted for 20 rounds by Dick Congress, of Victoria.
The coon was paragraphed as a brilliant boxer and
the hero of 100 victories; but he proved a gift
to Congress as he bogged in,; wide open and with
both hands swinging, to meet the Australian’s snappy
straight left, followed by a stinging right to the
body. The negro’s much-advertised punch never
materialised, his principal assets being a good
temper and an infinite capacity for taking the
pains which accompany a good hiding. The winner,
at Bst. 911 b., had 211 b. advantage in weight; his
advantage in science was much greater. A thin
“house” watched the Eagel being turned into a bird
with a broken wing.
* * * - *
Newcastle was kept awake by vibrant
SOS calls on Saturday night. The coaly city sent
three knights of the* laced glove to the joust at
Rushcutter Bay Stadium, and all three bumped
trouble. Two were well and truly licked, and the
third, Harry Collins, had to fight for his life and
his middleweight championship of Australia for 20
tense and troublous rounds. Collins (10si;. 1241 b.) had
“built ’imself up” to meet a bigger man in Eddie Parker
(list. 61b.) and had neglected the toughening pro-
cess, for he was distinctly flabby over the shoulders
and flanks and loose in the waist, and he showed
the lack of hard training as early as the fifth round.
The Maoriland heavyweight champion is an abnor-
mally tough gent, with a badly-bent proboscis and
an insatiable appetite for upholstered bones. For
15 rounds he never let up in a determined, dogged
attack, and Collins soon found that he had to go
for his life or go under. Even in the twentieth,
when bleeding and pulpy of feature, with ribs actually
red-raw, Parker staged a terrific run home, and
Collins, try as he might, could not keep him off,
let alone knock him down. One advantage to Harry',
besides the points verdict at the close, was that he
got an invaluable lesson at in-fighting, a phase of
the game at which he improved out of sight during
the fight. It was the most stirring and exciting
battle staged at the Stadium for some time.
“Old ’Un”: That relic of barbarism- the
20-round boxing- contest has been the cause of one
more death. Ten, or at the most twelve, rounds are
enough to settle any question of boxing supremacy,
and also ample to provide all the sport that anv
decent patron can desire, but the stupid and brutal
20-rounder is still permitted in Australia, although
it has been responsible for at least half a dozen
poor devils losing their lives in the last few years
alone. And the tragedy generally happens in the
18 th round. Nipeteen-y ear-old Arthur Smith suc-
cumbed in the 18th at Newcastle on Friday night;
he would have won on points had the bout been
limited to 10 rounds. Sailor Dunstan was ahead
of Max Oornik, in Melbourne, almost up to the fatal
ISth. Young Soady,. of Brisbane, was going great
guns up to 12 rounds, but was a dying lad in the
18th. George Mendfef?'got his issue in the 15tli,
at the Sydney Stadium, and up to 10 rounds Gordon
hadn t put a glove on him. Perhaps because so
many politicians are unabashed deadheads, it is
hard to get anything done for the poor devil of a
boxer, who has no Employers’ Liability or Workers’
Compensation Act to protect him, although invariablv
belonging to the working class. So the odds are
against the 20-rounder being declared illegal, though
it should have been abolished long ago. '

tour Britain will be chosen by H. L. Collins, Clem
Hill and Jack Ryder, and managed by Sid Smith.
Smith was manager of the 1921 team; he
will be the first man to take charge of successive
tours. He is secretary to the Board of Control.
Other candidates for the managerial job were M. A.
Noble, Vernon Hansford and Tom Howard, "and
Warwick had a shot at a as also did
E. E. Bean, who was one of last year’s three.
“Tren”: Many followers of the game are dis-
appointed that the manager’s job has again been
given to a non-player, instead of to one of the old
champions. Noble: or Ransford would certainly
have been a more papular choice. Monty ranks with
the world’s best as a bowler, a batsman, a fields and !
a captain ; moreover, he is a sound judge of cricket
with a knowledge of English conditions in all cir-
cumstances. And there is Carter. If he had been
appointed, a second ’keep would have been unneces-
sary ; like the late Frank Laver, he would have
doubly earned his trip by good work on the field.
In my judgment, a successful career as an Australian
player should be deemed more worthy of reward than
a lifetime of cricket legislation.

There was another 55,000 crowd, worth
about £2700, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground when
Melbourne and Collingwood met in the League
football final. It was a gruelling struggle, with
little systematic play until near the end, when the
Fuchsias had lost hope and the Magpies had no need
for anxiety. At the end, m’any players were limping,
but the Red Legs had the worse of the luck,
Dunbar and Taylor being useless through wrenched
muscles, while Davie was carried off unconscious
The result would have been the same had nothing
happened to any of them, though their rout might
not have been so disastrous. At the finish the board
said; Collingwood, 8 goals 1 5 behinds; Melbourne
3 goals 8 behinds. Geelong is to meet Collingwood
in the “grand” final.
OVER THE ODDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A bag containing £2OOO was stolen from a book-
maker at Randwick after the last race on Saturday.
The victim said he wouldn’t have minded losing the
money to the public, but to be robbed !”
I should have shrugged my shoulders if my clients
Had hit me up for such a wad, or more.
In any game, like this, of chante-ciiWi-seience
One mustn’t grumble at the fortune o’ war.
But to be robbed, no less—-(What price Defiance?
I’m taking 7 to 4.)
Pillaged in daylight broad of such a lump
Of currency might give a saint the hump.
Break me, who will, with straight-out bets or doubles,
To spring fair odds you’ll never find me shy.
We all get knocks sometimes. My blanky troubles!
I’m barring nothing ! and I’ll make the sky
The limit. (Eh? What am 1 laying Bubbles?
If l were you I'd try
Somebody else. You might do better thus.)
But robbers in the ring!—it’s scandalous.
Ratted —and by a crook! Fair play’s a jewel
Transcending any diamond that 1 slip
Upon my fingers. I’d ha’ taken my gruel
From any of the punting fellowship.
Nor squealed at any loss, however cruel,
Nor dropped my upper lip.
’Neath plungers’ shots with second sight endowed
My head might bloody be—but never bowed.
Oft have I stood and felt my bag a-growing
Lighter as favorite after favorite went
First past the post, no oaths about me throwing
And making no unsportsmanlike lament.
You see, I knew, wherever the stuff was going
It wasn’t lost—just lent.
That was the bread one on the water flings ;
This dough, it’s pounds to pence, has taken wings.

“H.K.”: Still living in Mosman (Sydney)
is R. 11. Harnett, who in 1871 started the
first ferry to the waterside suburb. Acquir-
ing an old iron steamer, the Herald, he ran
a half-hourly service from the Quay at 6d.
a trip.
Maoriland lost one of its most distin-
guished botanists recently when Dr. Donald
Petrie died at Auckland, aged 78. M.L.
awarded him the Hector medal, and his col-
lection of herbs, numbering over 30,000, goes
to the Wellington Museum. Before the
grasshopper became a burden Petrie was a
school-inspector—had been one for nearly 40
years, which must be something like an Aus-
tralasian record.
James Noble, the aborigine of the Yarra-
bah tribe (Q.) who was recently ordained
in Perth by the Anglican Bishop of Nor’-
West Australia, is held in high regard by
those in charge of the Forrest River Mission,
Wyndham (W.A.). Reference was made
to him in a recent criminal trial at Wynd-
ham, when a Perth lawyer put it to one of
the missionaries, “You allow a nigger called
Jimmy Noble to carry a rifle?” The answer
came back, “We permit a gentleman of that
name to carry one.” Counsel gasped.
Appealing successfully to the Public Ser-
vice Board against the appointment of Hal-
dane, J. C. Westlioven, public-service inspec-
tor, has secured the job of deputy-director
of postal services in Vic. He succeeds Bright,
who was styled deputy-P.M.G. Cultured and
capable, with an outlook far beyond his
department, Westhoven is a fine type of
civil servant. In his youth he was in the
Postal Department in W.A. Then he be-
came accountant first in Vic., then in N. S.
Wales; and as public-service inspector he
has shown exceptional versatility.
“Cartot”: No official move of recent years
has given the underworld so much annoyance
as the system of exchanging detectives be-
tween the capital cities of the Common-
wealth. Formerly a man might be a notori-
ous criminal in one capital and so unknown
in other States that he could invoke the
First Offenders’ Act when trouble overtook
him. Nowadays, however, even on his arri-
val in a city where he has never been before,
he is always likely to run into a detective
from his own town who is perfectly familiar
with his features and his record.
In 1924 the Straits Settlements, a small
British colony of 1600 square miles of which
Singapore is the most important part,
attracted 181,430 yellow immigrants, 54,720
of them being women and children. Aus-
tralia’s increase by white immigration in the
past ten years was 121,265, which was 13 per
cent, of the total increase. In view of the
enormous publicity given to the question and
the amount of wind and political manoeuvring
devoted to it, the result is not spectacular. If
the realisation of the White Australia policy
is considered as a race against Time, Time
seems to be leading by once round and a bit.
In recognition of his fine work in the last
34 years, the Metropolitan Board of Works
(Vic.) has given its sec., George Gibbs,
nine months’ leave of absence and £lOOO,
which ought to cover the exes, of a trip over-
seas he intends to take. Beginning as a
reporter on a Bendigo daily, Gibbs was
snapped up by the Railway Department after
he came to Melbourne, and worked up to
chief clerk of the locomotive branch under
Alison Smith when that forceful man was
head of the branch. Then White Knight
Fitzgibbon, on becoming the big noise of the
Board of Works, grabbed Gibbs, and he has
been principal executive officer since.
“Flicker”: A candidate for district coun-
cil honors in an Adelaide suburb was not
strong in his knowledge of English, but was
always eager to pick up “good-soundin’
things to say. ’ Discussing his chances of
election with a supporter, he was told: “Your
majority is assured; your opponent is a
mere cipher.” Blank treasured up this for
his stock of phrases, and soon had occasion
to use it, for his despised rival beat him.
“I wouldn’t ’ave minded,” he wailed, “if I’d
been beaten by a man, but ’im —why, ’e’s
only a siphon !”
“Rokeby”: I submit that “Bobby” Knop-
wood, the Speck’s first chronicler, clerical mis-
fit though he was, deserves a more sympathetic
treatment than J. H. M. Abbott has given
him in “The Soft Answer” (B. 27/8/’25).
My grandfather knew “Bobby” well when
the old man was living in semi-retirement
at Clarence Plains, and I have had excep-
tional opportunities for reading him up at
first hand; indeed, one of Knopwood’s diaries
is still in my possession. They are prim
productions considering their subject matter;
and their occasional references to very merry
dinners, the doings of “Governor Collins’s
young friend,” or Mrs. Powers, or the break-
ing of the great drought of 1805 (“very poor
rum” from the Leeward Islands), which made
Bobby “too ill to leave my tent,” might be
read at a Sunday-school. They show the
diarist zealous in his duties as magistrate,
somewhat callous as to floggings (but un-
expectedly sensitive in regard to hangings,
which left him physically ill), an enthusias-
tic gardener and huntsman, and a great
admirer of “our beautiful native shrubs
a rollicking blade, but, after all, not such a
bad colonist.
“G. 8.”: That “Pedro” should have set
down D. C. J. Donnelly as a member of the
first N.S.W. Labor party is excusable, since
the dailies at first placed him and F. B.
Suttor (afterwards knighted) in the Labor
list. Both members promptly repudiated the
assertion, and sat behind G. R. Dibbs in the
Protectionist ranks when the House met.
Donnelly, who died during March, 1896, was
very tail and very deaf; he was brother to
Ignatius, who wrote “Caesar’s Column” and
“The Great Cryptogram,” one of the first
contributions to Shakspeare-Bacon con-
troversy. Another Donnelly (a son or
nephew) was employed on Truth, where
he absorbed the Napoleonic craze from John
Norton. While his chief was absent on his
Senatorial campaign of 1901. Donnelly
donned a military greatcoat and wore his
hat, three-cornered and crosswise, in tin;
fashion of a field-marshal’s cap. As he stood
on the doorstep of Truth office, with lus
arms akimbo and his chin on his chest in
moody contemplation, Norton unexpectedly
descended from a motor-car. A few minutes
later Donnelly was sent for and told there
was “rooip for only one blanky Napoleon m
this office.” Thereupon the young chap
moved on to a good billet in Shanghai.

Draped and swathed in silver, and looking
like the statue of a Greek muse, Clara Butt,
the only rival the Town Hall organ has ever
known, pealed over Sydney on Saturday
night. The voice, as extraordinarily irfajes-
tic and overpowering as ever (it makes one
think of Byron’s “Roll On, Thou Deep and
Dark Blue Ocean, Roll!”), swept out first
in Handel’s “Rend il Sereno” ; some of the
notes seemed truly to reverberate through
unfathomed caves of ocean, so deep and full
they were. The same rich effects almost
submerged the audience in Beethoven’s “Cre-
ation’s Hymn.” But the artistic offering of
the contralto’s evening was Sigurd Lie’s
“SofPfooted Snow” and Eric Fogg’s “Peace.”
Kennerley Rumford’s opening group held
compositions by Strauss, Brahms and Hugo
Wolf, and of these Wolf’s “Verborgenheit”
made perhaps the deepest impression. But
Mr. Rumford’s sea chanties are things of joy,
and he should be encouraged thereto. Being
a Butt concert “Land of Hope and Glory,”
of course, popped up its perennial head, and
at the waving of Dame Clara’s arms the
audience not only joined in the chorus, but
stood up reverently to do it. Finally after
a tornado of applause, husband and wife
came coyly forward and gurgled “The Keys
of Heaven,” which is such an epitome of
the Resch breach-of-promise cas:; it might
have been written to fit that episode. The
French pianist Marie Aussenac offered a glit-
tering Contrast to the leading lady’s sonorous
majesty; and Roy Ellett is an accompanist
who knows what his part is and does it with
artistry.

The droll frivolity of Will Fyffe will pro-
ceed no further than the end of this week at
the Sydney Tivoli, and staunch barrackers of
the amusing Caledonian are wearing a funeral
look. Still, there are the Sterlings to keep
the audience in strained amazement' with
their antics on skates; for their benefit the
theatre is plunged into darkness while they
jig about on a grating which sends forth a
sort of Morse-code message in electric
flashes as the skates make contact. Other
conspirators in the dispelling of gloom are
Wykeham, Preston and Dunn in a festive
study of feminine infidelity, Maurice Dia-
mond and his sextette in toe-tripping turns
and physical jerks set to music, and Ross and
Tier in a spasm of nonsense, appropriately
labelled “Silly but Soothing.”
F. Gayle Wyer’s breezy revue co. is still
stubbornly resisting the encroachment of the
vaudeville section on the second half of the
bill at Sydney Fullers’. This week’s weapon
comprises a mirthful concoction called
“Island of Dreams,” with Gayle Wyer him-
self the spine of the revue as Opie tJmm,
absent without leave from a lunatic asylum.
From the clumsy hands of the film pro-
ducer, John Galsworthy’s masterly portrayal
of modern-day restlessness, “The White
Monkey,” has emerged at. Sydney Lyceum
divorced from all the qualities of the printed
work. The penetrating character studies, the
kindly aristocrat with his emotional support
of the oppressed, and the author’s refined
and classical style are missing, and, instead,
there is a trite triangular story, interpreted
by an alien band of cinema actors. Hoyt’s
show’ the daring attempt of a young scientist
to blow up a meeting of his creditors; and
at least there is thrill in it. Good Austra-
lians are thronging “Around the Boree Log”
at the Crystal Palace, a dinkum local-made
film and an excellent tonic for those tired
of oversea trash.
The substantial interest in the old-time
pTay will probably give “A Royal Divorce”
as successful a season as “The Silver King”
had; but, as staged at the Melbourne Royal
on Saturday night, it doesn’t deserve as
much, because it is an ill-cast production. For
the unsteadiness of her lines on the opening
night, Muriel Starr had an excuse in a motor
accident, as the result of which a Chinaman
was lying in hospital on the danger list;
but, making all excuses, she was by no means
a convincing Josephine; and with J. B.
Atholwood available —an actor who has to
his credit a fine performance of Napoleon—
it could only have been an absurd regard for
stage precedence w’hich gave Frank Harvey
a part for which he was quite unfitted.
Harvey’s false stomach roused a laugh
amongst the irreverent gallery girls at its
first appearance; but more amusement might,
have been felt at the programme declaration
that he was Napoleon. He wasn’t; at no
time during the performance did he carry any
conviction that he was the conqueror of
Europe. Atholwood, given the part of Gri-
maud, made a great deal of it, and was one
of the few successes of the production. Gas-
ton Mervale’s Marquis de Beaumont was
another; but the fine part of Tallyrand
missed a good deal of its quality in the hands
of Harvey Adams. Kenneth Brampton also
failed to make much of General Angereau ;
he seemed to share with John Fernside, who
was very awkward in a small part, a feeling
that a uniform did not fit his style of art.
Herbert Leigh played Dr. Corvisart in a
workmanlike fashion; Lance Fairfax, as
Jaques, sang “The Little Corporal” very
nicely; but there was a British naval officer
who was an obvious invitation to mutiny on the
part of his men—he even seemed afraid of
his lines. Floie Allan offered a sprightly
and very acceptable Stephanie; but Mildred
Cottell was more melodramatic than stately
as the Empress Marie Louise. Emma Temple
did her little as the Nurse very well, Mary
Marvin was more than fair as Blanche, and
little Phyllis Moyle was a more than usually
efficient youngster as the infant King of
Rome. The staging was good; and the
audience made its loudest sounds of approval
when it witnessed the well-arranged tableaux
at the end of Acts IV and V.
* * * *
Back at Melbourne Athenaeum, delightful
Edna Thomas found a warm welcome await-
ing her on Saturday night, the crowded
audience lavishing cheers upon her singing
of “I Got Shoes”—the articles iof foot-
wear with which she declares that she
intends to walk all over God’s Heaven —and
“I’se Bin ’Buked an’ I’se Bin Scorned” and
“liock-a Mali Soul in the Busum of Abri-
him” were other prime favorites. But all
that this lady does is delicate and captivat-
ing. Lucille Lawrence, with her harp, adds
to the pleasure of the programme, and Con-
stance Piper, on the piano, is what an accom-
panist should be; when these two musicians
get together to play “Kentucky Home” a
hungry audience demands more in a loud
voice. There are to be concerts to-night
(Thursday) and on Saturday.
ft
“No, No, Nanette,” is still the landlord’s
answer to every suggestion that the lady
should leave Melbourne’s New Princess
Theatre.
The papers (more or less) of the world
were represented in the d.c. of His
Majesty’s, Melbourne, on Thursday, when
“CHARLEY'S AUNT,” AT MELBOURNE
PALACE.
Paul Lonquct as Charlie Wykenam; Frank
Neill as Lord Fancourt Babberley, im-
personating the aunt; Victor Fitzherbert
as Sir Francis Chesney.
there was a Press Conference Gala Night;
and the verdict of the visiting journalists
(there are a few even at a Press Conference)
confirmed the local opinion of the charming
“Wildflower” show 7 .
The lady from the place where the "nuts
come from is staying with her relatives at
the New Palace, Melbourne, much longer
than was originally intended; in fact, “Char-
ley’s Aunt” has proved such a winning ticket
that it is expected to run five weeks Or even
longer.
Next Tuesday afternoon (13th) Melbourne
will lay its tribute at the feet of Maggie
Moore. Amateurs and professionals have
combined in volunteering services; and a
nigger minstrel first-part promises to provide
much hilarity—Senator Guthrie, undisturbed
by election clouds, is in it, with Fritz Hart,
cricketer Warwick Armstrong, genial host
.Tack Perrin, and a smattering of other pri-
vate citizens and sundry thespians; and
Charlie Pope, who was the most popular
colored comedian Australia has known, is
amongst the contributors on the other part
of the programme. People who would be
eager enough to pay their guineas merely’as
a tribute to Maggie Moore will get full value
for their money.
E. J. Carroll, who has a fine nose for popu-
lar features, pounced on Harry Green before
he had a chance to get away to America after
his tour of the Tivoli circuit; and he and Roy
Rene, lately of Fuller’s, are to put on Aaron
Hoffman’s farce, “Give and Take,” at the
Melbourne Athenamm on Saturday week.
Incited by the success of the recent week’s
season at the Playhouse, the Vic. Opera Co.
saw in the emptiness of the King’s Theatre
the beckoning finger of Opportunity ; and on
Saturday night a further week’s season of
“Rip Van Winkle” opened at that showhouse.
The King’s gave the cast a better chance, and
being now well drilled in their parts, they
showed a decided improvement all round.
Melbourne Reifertorians will lie busy at the
Playhouse on Wednesday next (Oct. 14) and
three following days. The play, “The Man-
darin’s Coat,” is by Isabel Handley, a very
active and capable member of the society.
It is likely to be produced shortly in London,
where it is under offer.
Fritz Hart put a remarkable amount of
his volatile enthusiasm into “The Magic
Flute,” produced by the Melba Conserva-
torium Opera Society at the Albert-street
building, and inspired his players to extract
the full beauty which lies in a good deal of
the music out of the often-confused mush
of the whole. There were some faults in the
concerted work, and the vocal efforts failed
always to reach the heights demanded of
them, this being particularly noticeable on
the first night; but, then, it is a work of
very considerable difficulty. There was a
large cast which was changed each night;
nothing particularly distinguished mani-
fested itself in the singing: but Miss Ger-
trude Healy did outstandingly well in lead-
ing the orchestra.
Melbourne had another opportunity of
hearing Clive Carey, who came from Adel-
aide to take part in the Liedertafel's century
concert, when, in conjunction with T. I*.
Fielden, who spoke to the audience through
the piano in a manner which evoked en-
thusiasm, he gave a concert at the Melbourne
Assembly Hall. Fielden’s best was Busoni’s
transcription of Bach's “Chaconne.” Clive
Carey added interest to his clear-cut singing,
slightly marred by some affectations, with a
historic excursion, wandering tunefully from
the songs of the Elizabethan period down to
modern times, the Restoration period, repre-
sented by Boyce, Purcell and Blow, providing
the greatest charm of the Odyssey.
Clive Carey provided the items of most
importance at the hundredth concert given
by the Royal Victorian Liedertafel —the
society was formed in 1905, although there
were Liedertafel efforts before, dating back
to 1873. Carey has a post in the Adelaide
Conservatorium, and was specially engaged
to come over as soloist for this occasion. In
Schubert’s “Doppelhanger” he had a great
opportunity and used it, being both musical
and intensely dramatic; and he earned his
repeated recalls. The Liedertafel itself, in
less good form than usual, was weak in the
tenor parts particularly; it was best in
Elgar’s “The Wanderer” and “Zut! Zut!
Zut!” Miss Viola Morris pleased the audi-
ence in a Mozart song, and Margery Gray
gave some acceptable violin solos.
“Dangerous Innocence” prevails this week
at Hoyt’s De Luxe, “In Life’s Arena” being
its twin feature; herein the troubles of
women have a good innings. There is some-
thing more breezy in “The King of the
Wild Horses” at the Majestic—an animal
story full of exciting moments, with a nag
of wonderful sagacity as the star. The sort
of journalist who occupies a large space in
American literature is the central figure in
“The Fatal Mistake”; and Vera Bedford
sings during intervals. After its classical
concerts the Auditorium returns to the
screen business with the spectacular “Lost
World.”
ALEX. J. CARROLL, manager Fullers'
Bijou Theatre, Melbourne.
The well-boomed Dorothy Brenner, who
opened at Melbourne Tivoli on Saturday, is
much more a gas-glimmer than a star. The
lady is pleasing to look upon, but her voice
and manner are both stilted and affected, and
her method of delivering very mediocre
material lacks life. However, Herschel Henlere
makes atonement for a good deal, his work at
the piano remaining as fresh and entertaining
as ever; and there are other items on the
programme, including “the Watch King
who finishes this week, which keep it bright.
The “Eleven Wonders” continue to brighten
a Melbourne Bijou programme which in
generally good, although Estelle Rose, a
statuesque lady in nice clothes, billed as an
“International Impressioniste” in Character
Songs and Studies,” is better worth looking
at than hearing, and Alec Kellaway, another
addition, is a somewhat tame vocalist.
Harold Walden, with the assistance of a
piano and a suave humor, provides good
entertainment, aud the ingenious Cardan
lias provided a new 7 box of tricks for which
he deserves applause.

Now 13 years of age, she has been a pupil
of Elsie Stevenson —Minnie Everett’s lieu-
tenant in her Sydney dancing school —since
she was six. Edna is very intelligent, and
has a voice which, if not spoiled by injudi-
cious usage or defective teaching, gives pro-
mise of future excellence.
“Coot”: Melbourne’s little Playhouse is
being acquired by a co. which intends to con-
vert it into a cabaret and cafe. The place
will be remodelled, and a floor to accommo-
date over 1100 dancers put down.
“C. Ockney”: Charles Heslop, who did
such consistently good work here in several
Hugh Ward musical plays, has soon got
into harness in England. He is touring with
the principal “No, No, Nanette,” co., play-
ing the giddy Jimmy Smith, which another
old Australian friend, Joseph Coyne, rattles
through in the London production.
“Lud” (London) : “Lightnin’” has gone
up again in the West End, this time at the
Savoy. Horace Hodges and Diana Wilson
are in their old parts. Seymour Hicks has
found time to write yet another play, “The
Price of Silence.” He gave it a trial spin
in Dublin, with himself and Madge Tither-
adge in the leading parts. Madge made a
hit, but Seymour is miscast. Veteran
Thomas Hardy is about to produce his own
stage adaptation of “Tess of the D’Urber-
villes.” It has already been seen in his
beloved Wessex, where it was played by a
company of village actors. When the London
production was decided upon, a press-agent
asserted that a thousand applications for the
part of Tess had been received from (mostly)
out-of-work actresses. The character has
been allotted to Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies,
already a favorite leading lady in the West
End.
“Minim”: Lovers of Gilbert and Sullivan
will be surprised to hear that a new musical
piece in which the famous names are once
more associated is running in New York.
Gilbert nearly half a century ago wrote a
satirical comedy called “Engaged.” Some
Americans recently dug it up and proceeded
to turn it into a musical comedy. Lyrics
were written to fit old songs composed by
Sullivan and contemporary musicians, and
the result seems to have been in eyery way
a success. Anyhow, the piece, for which
Gilbert’s old title is retained (extraordinary
that it wasn’t rechristeried “Why, William!”
or “Ha, Ha, Arthur!”) is described as one
of the most delightful entertainments to be
witnessed op Broadway.
“Brad”: “Abie’s Irish Rose” was the hit
of the last New York theatrical season, as it
was of the season before that and likewise
the previous season. In other words, the
piece is now in its third year of success. The
joke is that it was turned down by manager
after manager, and even after it got itself
produced, the whole profession having cried
stinking fish, the proprietor of the playhouse
where it was being staged declined to ad-
vance a thousand dollars for a quarter share
in it. He missed making a fortune. Nowa-
days the plutocratic author is asking almost
prohibitive terms for the English and Aus-
tralian rights.
. “0.13. B.”: Eric Maxon, who plays a load-
ing part in “The Nigger,” is quite an old
Sydney favorite. He was a matinee idol in
J9K, when he made Ben Hur an imposing
character in two revivals of Wallace’s play
at the Royal that year. He also imper-
sonated David Kingsley in “Harbor Lights,”
and switched over to Faust in Gilbert
Parkers version; Jerrold Robertshaw was
the Mephisto and Beatrice Terry the Mar-
guerite, while Eardley Turner was the aged
doctor in the prologue. Maxon returned as
Richard Gilder in the Muriel Starr produc-
tion of “Within the Law” at the Criterion
m September, 1913. Noel in “Madame X”
was his next character, and he had a part
in “The Yellow Ticket.” Poverty Pointers
are glad to see him once more.
"Ces” : The members of a co. which struck
a streak of bad luck in Melbourne have scat-
tered far and wide. Some of them are doing
prologue work for the pitchers, and I saw
two other's trying to sell tiny rag dolls at
the Royal Show. They are clever young-
sters, too, and it seems a pity. Still, I sup-
pose hundreds of mummers as good or better
have had to take on equally humble means
of paying for their kippers and coffee since
the great theatrical slump began in Britain.
"Uramao”: An Auckland girl, Cissie
Staunton, thirty years ago had made some-
thing of a reputation as a singer in the
Queen City, when a German organist named
Goldenstedt married her and they crossed
RADIO NOTE.
YOUNG CHEERFUL: “Gonna listen-in, Mister?”
ABY: “Vat that you ask?”
YOUNG CHEERFUL: “Weil, you got your crystal set with you, ain’t you?”
to Australia, where she became contralto
soloist in the Montague-Turner Opera Co.
After Goldenstedt’s death she went to Eng-
land, and her second husband was a Dutch-
man, one Gaetjens. They took up their
residence in Holland. Now news comes
that Cecilia Elizabeth Gaetjens has died at
Hampstead, London.
“C.K.”: During an interval at rehearsal
one day, Frank Cellier, Charlie Brookfield,
Dick Temple (the original “Mikado”) and
I. were chatting in the Savoy cafe when
the conversation turned upon writs. Brook-
field gaily said he had been served that
morning with a red one, which completed his
set. “You should never have allowed the
matter to go so far as that,” interposed
Temple. “Why,” he added gravely, “you’ll
be having a policeman tap you on the
shoulder to say you’re wanted at Hollo-
way.” And the moralist proceeded to give
Brookfield some fatherly advice. The next
morning Temple was a.w.l. from rehearsal.
About noon a note was brought to Cellier:
“Dear Frank, —Please send me by bearer
£2 14s. 7d. lam in Holloway.-—Yours,
Dick.”
“Ancient Prompter”: The ill-advised
speech to the audience by Dion Titheradge
(B. l/10/’25) reminds me that a similar
happening was the cause of George Anson
coming to Australia. A piece he played in
at London Adelphi was booed on the first
night, and Anson told the booers what he
thought of them. The London public never
forgave him, and as engagements grew
scarce he decided to try this side of the
world.
“Schnorrer”: Entertainments at which the
glossy shirt-front and jewelled finery of
Israel can be displayed have followed the
trail of Zionist colonisation in Palestine. In
the modern sense the country is only a few
years old ; yet the Palestine Opera Co., under
the control of Colonel Kisch, who was known
in America as an entrepreneur, has in two
years produced seven operas, giving 51 per-
formances. Expenses ran away with over
£B5OO, and the revenue exceeded that by
slightly over £lOO, which, as the original
capital was only £lOOO, was not bad for a
beginning.
“C.K.”: No one in the Commonwealth is
more conversant with the Gilbert and Sulli-
van operas than Minnie Everett. Minnie
knows them all from “The Sorcerer” to
“Utopia, Ltd.,” which play she produced for
its first performance in Australia. This
clever lady’s present contract with J. C.
Williamson, Ltd., expires about the time the
G. and S. operas are due for revival, but it
is hardly likely that the Firm will let her go.
“C. Ockney”: Many playgoers, myself
amongst the number, must have been sur-
prised to i‘ead “Mid-Channel’s” disparaging
reference (B. l/10/’25) to Wilson Barrett’s
Silver King. It’s a long time ago, but I
know that the actor-manager played Denver
all through the long London season—a record
run in those days. I have seen half a dozen
Denvers in Australia, not one of whom failed
in the part. And yet Wilson Barrett, who
“created” it—but, there, I give it up!
“Ancient Prompter”: The good old days
of spectacular Bland Holt and George Rig-
nold melodrama are recalled by the death in
London of Arthur Shirley, a prolific author,
who is said to have written, or to have been
concerned in the writing of. a hundred plays.
Shirley collaborated with George R. Sims in
“The Two Little Vagabonds,” with Albert
Chevalier in “My Old Dutch” and with Ben
Landeck in “Tommy Atkins,” “Saved from
the Sea,” “Woman and Wine” and many an-
other thriller seen on Australian boards. His
most ambitions effort on his own account was
the romantic drama “Ned Kean of Old
Drury,” which was done at Drury-lane two
years ago.
“Satis”: “Parec’s” remarks on the dress-
ing—or undressing—of revues in the Gay
City (B. 24/9/’25) seemed too nude to be
true until I came upon a choice morsel in
a London journal’s theatrical letter from
Paris. The writer was describing the new
piece at the Ambassadeurs:—
The spectacular scenes arc negligible, but there is
a pretty eighteenth-century tableau, in which a youth
is so enamored of a statue of Venus that he rebuffs
the advances of two dainty Marquises (Christian*
and Marie Guy). Thereupon they shyly remove
their garments, and their youthful charms eclipse
the statue’s,
it is good to know that the ladies were
"shy” about it.
“E.T.”: The Briton is certainly loyal ro
plays that he likes. “A Royal Divorce” has
been on the road continuously since its first
London production 33 years ago. “Char-
ley’s Aunt,” living up to its posters, is “still
running.” And the present proprietor of
“The Belle of New' York”—there were one
or two before him—proudly advertises on his
bills that it is his 26th year of tour w 7 ith
the tuneful American piece.
“C.H.R.”: A quaint slip is made in the
Iliya scene in “Snap,” at the Sydney Cri-
terion. The English impresario hands the
would-be prima donna, also English, a pound-
note on the Thames Embankment. And it
is an Australian note.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Our co. flattered itself
that it did the railway smash in “East
Lynne” rather well. One night, however, the
miniature cardboard train which was pulled
across the backcloth started to climb the
mountain, instead of keeping to the track.
An alert stage-manager saved the situatior
by blacking out and ordering the lifting of
the backcloth to reveal the train-wreck at
close quarters; and, although ruthless hands
had to be laid on a gibbering railway porter,
who persisted in talking about the impend-
ing smash after it had happened, the audi-
ence seemed to be satisfied. And once in
“The Flying Scud” a similar backcloth effect
nearly held up a race meeting. The Derby
had started, and the excitement was being
well worked up by a crowded “stage” (dead-
heads all), when the cardboard horses on the
backcloth suddenly came to a stop. George
Majeroni , promptly stretched his arm
across the racecourse and gave the gee-
gees a shove along, and the hitch passed
unnoticed. The number of things that pass
unnoticed by audiences would surprise any-
body but an illusionist. He knows. He
lives by it.
“O.B.B.”: The revival of “Rip Van
Winkle” in Melbourne recalls the first pro-
duction of that play' in Sydney on Febru-
ary 16, 1885. A. T. and D. Dunning were
the managers, and the theatre was the old
Gaiety ; the cast at the beginning included
T. B. Appleby (Rip), Howard Vernon (Nick
and Jan Vedder), Annette Ivanova (Gret-
chen, and Alice Van Winkle in the last act),
Knight Aston (Lieut. Hans Von Slaus).
Annie Leaf (Katrina) and Arthur Lissant.
After the first week Vernon, who was also
the producer, changed parts with Appleby.
On February 3, 1900, Vernon himself pre-
sented "Rip” at the Opera House, with Maud
Hewson. Victor Prince, Alice Howard Ver-
non and others. This was the last profes-
sional revival in Sydney of Planquette’s play.
Two Real Art Shows in Melbourne —
The Felton Trustees have thought so well of Will
Ashton’s show at the Fine Art Galleries that they
have bought four of the pictures—“ Looking Towards
Notre Dame, Paris,” “Cairo, Egypt,” “Laundry
Boats on the River Seine, Paris,” and “The Paint
Shop, Rue Galande, Paris” —and then they didn’t
buy all of the best. Ashton has lost the nebulous
and confused quality he once showed; all his
present offerings exhibit a surety of style allied to
fine craftsmanship and color sense. A particularly
clever work is No. 11, “The Native Quarter, Cairo.”
Looking into the picture, each one of the figures in
the throng is seen to be made with a couple of strokes
of color; yet a sense of movement and life pervades
the whole scene, the atmosphere of which is splendidly
caught and held. “Florence” (No. 17) is one of
the larger canvases, and a very fine one, but some
of the most appealing contain a treatment of grey
atmospheric effects upon the Seine and views of
Switzerland in which the villages and the hills
stand out almost starkly' in an atmosphere that
sends a chill into the bones. This is certainly the
most distinguished single-man show seen in Melbourne
for a very- considerable time.
Vida Lahey’s last exhibition in Melbourne was
one in which the main interest centred in pictures
of scenes of battle in France, painted with a sur-
prising vigor; for the present show at the Athenaeum
Galleiy, Australia supplies the material. The vigor
is still there, with a considerable mellowing of
method, and only now and then a failure to quite
achieve a bold ambition leaves a picture with a
certain crudeness, such as in the stark “Church
at Port Arthur” (No. IQ). “A Freshening Wind”
(No. S) shows the clouds and shadow of a storm
tumbling itself upon a lighted landscape—a picture
fresh and full of conviction. In “Twilight on
the Derwent” (No. 17) the artist’s habit of cutting-
out the skyline which sometimes gives her canvases
a fore-shortened appearance is marked, but the
picture attracts; in “Early' Spring” (No. 32) there
is a bold treatment of the shadows made on the
ground by' leafless trees that surprises but just
succeeds. It is in an insubstantiality of her living
figures that the artist has her chief weakness. Some
flower studies, especially fuchsias, are charming.
A QUESTION OF CLOTHES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“But, after all, it is not the clothes she wears
that matter; it is the girl herself that the really
ardent young man sees.” — Sphere (London).
In days of youth—brave days of old—
When nothing really mattered,
When fires of Love grew seldom cold
Or passions torn and tattered,
Ah, how delightful was the whirl
Of music lilting lightly,
When all the world was just a girl
Whose eyes were dancing brightly!
One didn’t care what clothes she wore.
With nought in the exchequer
The stars from Heaven Youth fondly tore
In ardent mood to deck her,
He saw her in his fancies clad—
Convention’s rules transgressing.
The eyes of any lusty lad
Are adepts at undressing!
Such days for me I fear are gone;
Clothed beauty is “dc rigger.”
1 note the costly clothes upon
The outlines of her figure.
No more it sets my brain a-whirl,
Another thought I harbor:
The eyes of Youth may strip a girl,
The purse of Age must garb her.
Victoria.

The Times Literary Supplement: “The main
value of this book lies in its painstaking record
of the history of taxation, both in the several
States and later in the Commonwealth.... At a
time when the grant of preferential duties is so
vital a question in the politics of the Empire,
the evolution of the tariff policy of the Com-
monwealth is a particularly important study,
and Mr. Mills gives a lucid account of its
variations from the first tariff of Sir George
Turner until the present day.”

The Particular Value of
and its superiority over all other preparations lie in its natural
action, it's fresh, invigorating, pleasant taste, and in the fact
that ENO assists Nature without supplanting her methods.
As a safeguard against those digestive ailments which often beset
us —as a blood purifier —as a gentle corrective for liver troubles —as
an aid to those who are subject to rheumatism or gout —as a
refreshing thirst-quencher —ENO’s “ Fruit Salt ” is unequalled.
All who value health and internal cleanliness should drink ENO —
just a small teaspoonful effervescing in a glass of water first
thing every morning.
ENO’s “ Fruit Salt ” is pure, highly concentrated, most pleasant in taste, and entirely
free from purgative mineral salts, sugar or artificial flavouring. ENO does not form
an undesirable habit, but can be taken at any time with perfect safety by young and old.

DRAWING IS PROFITABLE
The Weston method of
teaching drawing by post
is the most successful, be-
cause Mr. Weston teaches
his students to DRAW, not
to copy.
Many Weston pupils earn
money before they complete
the course, whilst several
successful Australian artists
owe their first training to
the Weston School.

Wisdom—engineering wisdom—has devised in
“ COMET ” WINDMILLS the simplest, strong-
est and most reliable method of obtaining a
regular supply of water.
And wisdom has this wonder-worker
using free power—the power of
the wind. Sensitive to the lightest
winds and yet so strong are
“ COMET ” mills that they keep
pumping when a gale blows.
Let the wisdom that designed
“ Comet ” windmills solve
your water supply problem.

Special represents the last word in com-
fortable sidecarring. The full elliptic
body springs of the big'Goulding are re-
placed by a long flexible transverse semi-elliptic
spring which gives lower t»ody position, lighter
weight and a beautifully easy ride.

to turn commonplaces into poetry... ,C.M. ( Byron
Bay 7): The drunk in the tank isn’t of much account.

narration. .. . J.R.L.: Frankly, the verse is awful. ...
A.R.Q.; Frantic effort to get mirth out of old
commonplaces.... Oliver B.: “Before the Rain” is
so realistic that instinctively we reached out far
our umbrella
Bill with downward looks trudges home;
Wind strong from the nor’-east.
Through the drought I’ve worked this lovely loam—
Feed will be scarce for man an’ beast.
“Ah hah! don’t be crying yet awhile, Bill!
’Aving y 7 ou seen those ants on the post ?
Why, blarme, they’re cornin’ in on my 7 window-sill;
It’s cert ther’s sunnnat coming down the coast.”
Yes! you, you’re always grinning up your sleeve,
You —-you don’t think serious as I do;
Steve was saying, too. we’d ’ave to leave,
An’ find summat else to do.
“Cut it out, Bill, that jumpy stuff;
It only makes one feel ill;

Why, the wind’s changed—look at your mill!”

“Wanderers” misses. .. .C.H.C.: The verse has pro-
mise, but it is very young. .. .E.T. (Eight Mile
Plains): Might sell somewhere else.... Pip Tok: Too
absurd J.C.G.; Very unlikely yarn with an artifi-
cial ending. —M.M.S.: Doesn’t get near. .. .Gertie
G. : Miles below standard... .E.M.T.: Crude, emaci-
ated and weak. .. .Coreen N.: Wooden verse and un-
interesting matter. .. .H.F.L. : No market for such
goods here William H.: The sonnet is bad in
form; both manner and matter fail.... Ivarl Garfish,
etc.; Nothing in the book gets near... .I.R. (Manly) :
They haven’t the feeling... .Ripponlea: It sounds
terrific:—
The lone patricide dazedly tried the meaning of it
all to unravel
As cracking wheels crackled over gravel.
A dragging, scratching noise and a dull thud.
Then all was silent, save for the sound of curdling
blood.
The stained glass door held a greenish smear,
Motionless, familiar and unfamiliar, queer,
And yet not queer. A subterranean blast
Sighed past his cheek, fast but not so fast.
Two feet he saw through the chink ’neath the door,
Strangely motionless, fixed to the floor.
He started to quake, and ache and shake;
With an echoing clatter his molars did chatter;
His breath came in whistles; his hair stood in
bristles.
Fearing his doom he traversed the room.
And with a choking chortle stood at the portal,
In his right hand the handle; in his left hand the
ea ndle.
The latch fell back with a startling crack,
And he screamed with grue as the door open flew.
... .Gwynplaine: The mystery is too deep... .Fred-
eric II.; It doesn’t strike us very hard. . . . F.S.B. :
The yarn leaves us sad... .Trevdee: “Lament” misses
by some distance... .T.P.N.: A little feeling in it,
but shows too little skill T.D.W.: Weak little
flutter... .T.W.W.: Hasn't enough point... .L.A.A.:
Nothing there for u 5.... Alan S.: Well enough done,
but too slight... .H..T.C.: The idea is better than the
handling, which is unequal.... D.G. (Moss Vale):
An old idea in poor verse.... Cecily E.: Nothing
attractive about the dishing up of an old theme. ...
Rewarewa: Too obvious and flimsy... .A.E.W.: Hard
working verse without feeling; and it starts with a
false rhyme.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.E.W.: Scratches, and feeble scratches at that.
S.M. (M.L.) : Study, and don’t copy anybody....
A.L.W.: Seem to have seen that drunk before....
J.H.: This office is not a casualty ward for your
mangled specimens. .. .A.E.W.: Putting the tail on
a pig, blindfolded, is apparently your limit G.H.:
Furry blobs. —J.G.: Back they go to Bendigo.

Folding top optional*
Across Seven Seas
Annually, 66 different
countries purchase Stude-
baker cars. Because of the
dependable, economical
service Studebaker cars de-
liver, the demand for them
is constantly increasing.
gf|gp|HIPMENTS of Studebaker cars
XgSp to export markets during the first
seven months of 1925 —a period
of 212 days were equal to the ship-
ments for the entire year, 1924. And
1924 was the biggest export year in
Studebaker’s history of 73 years.
Studebaker has won its position of lead-
ership through the rugged endurance of
Studebaker six-cylinder cars —their long
service and low operating cost
Only two cars are made on the “one-
profit” basis — Ford in the lowest price
field and Studebaker in the fine car field.
Only in these two cases are all bodies,
engines, clutches, gear boxes, spring...
differentials, steering gears, axles, gray
iron castings and drop forgings made by
one company.
One-profit manufacture makes a better
car and enables you to buy it for less
money.

"My heart with pleasure thrills
And dances with the daffodils”
When penning these lines Wordsworth must have felt in a rather
exultant mood. A heart that wants to go jazzing with the daffo-
dils is unusually rare, and what a merry old world this would
he if we could all have those feelings. But, modern conditions
of living intervene. The constant race againSl time means
hurried and irregular meals, which in time claim their pitiless
toll in the form of Acute Indigestion
And it’s when the digestive organs become clogged with poisonous
secretions that those dull, nagging pains in the stomach arise.
Headaches, constipation and despondency follow —life doesn’t
seem to be worth living
In this state you require a true service medicine, such as that reliable old family jnend

“Trevdee” : What is probably an Austra-
lian record for land value in a town of under
3000 inhabitants was attained at Nhill
(Vic.) the other day when a street property
changed hands at £lB4 per foot.
“Sturt”: The Savings Bank of S.A. put
up all kinds of records in the past year. It
paid three-quarters of a million as interest
on deposits, being able to give 4| per cent.,
a rate not equalled for the past 30-odd years.
It has on its books just three-fourths of the
population of the State, man, woman and
child. Serious depositors (that is, leaving
out the penny-bank accounts) are 56 per
cent, of the population, and the bank holds
some 17 millions of their money.

“S.R.”: The shortage some time ago of
American hickory axe-handles offered this
country an opportunity of providing a suit-
able substitute, but none came along. Writers
claimed that spotted-gum was its equal,
but it did not answer the purpose. It is a
fact that American hickory has virtues for
certain classes of work not possessed by any
known Australian wood. My question is
“Why doesn’t the Forestry Commission culti-
vate it in this country and give the local
manufacturer a chance to make a fortune?”
With axe-handles at 4s. each there should be
no difficulty about the fortune.
* * * *
“J.A.” : I have heard of debts being liqui-
dated in many strange ways, but the young
chap I struck in the mallee country was
doing the job in a fashion quite new to me.
He hailed from the Murray and had been
assisted by a fisherman both with hospitality
and financially. Knowing that the big white
grubs of the hawk-moth were excellent bait,
he started to collect them. It meant hard
work, for both the mallee and honeysuckle-
trees had to be split in order to get at the
Pj*ey; yet he stuck to it and forwarded con-
signments regularly until he got a receipt,
“Settled with grubs,” as well as an order
for a gross at 2s. 6d. a dozen.
* * * »
“Gwydir”: The pioneer of the N.S.W.
hardwood (export) industry was Gavin
Scott, of Sibbald, Scott and Co., who during
1894 took specimens of N.S.W. hardwoods
to England. There he published a pamphlet
pointing out the advantages of these timbers
for wood-blocks; later he formed the Aus-
tralian Timber Co., Ltd. (capital £50,000),
for the purpose of making advances to Aus-
tralian sawmillers and pushing the trade.
As a result of the visit, orders totalling
£20,000 were booked. Previously England’s
wood-blocks were imported from the Stettin
Forests (Germany) and South America. Five
months after his return Scott chartered the
Nova Scotian windjammer Harvest Queen
to carry the first cargo of N.S.W. hardwood
to England. It consisted of 70,000 ft. (black-
butt, tallow-wood and mahogany) and lefl
Sydney in September, 1895.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: A nice point regarding em-
ployers’ liability has been raised in Mel-
bourne. A carter lost his temper with a
horse which obstinately refused to budge,
and the missile he hurled at the refractory
animal ricochetted from the collar and
struck in the eye a plumber who was
working on contract on the same job. The
victim went to hospital; discharged with
damaged eyesight he claimed £249 compensa-
tion from the employers of the passionate
carter. The Court expressed the opinion
that, if the carter in using his whip, the
recognised medium of horse correction, had
accidentally inflicted the injury, the em-
ployers might be liable, but that his action in
throwing something at the beast could hardly
be recognised as done “in the course of his
employment.” A part denial of the facts
alleged by the plaintiff helped in securing
the dismissal of the case; but an appeal
might help to clear up the law on a some-
what obscure point.
* * * *
“Transfer Porter”: Stationed at a big
Vic. railway junction, I have the handling
of tons of commercial travellers’ sample-
hampers, tins, boxes, etc., every week. On
Monday about 10 firms’ representatives
arrive from Melbourne with anything up to
lOcwt. or 12cwt. of samples apiece, each lot
waybilled to a different station. Why if,
should take half a dozen travellers, with
several tons of samples, calling every week or
so, to serve the needs of a one-horse town-
ship of about 500 people is a mystery. Some-
times I wonder if the contents of all those
big hampers are really genuine samples,
especially when my wife shows me a fancy
pair of boots or a new hat that she got “as
a great favor, because they were samples.”
The freight for travellers’ samples is not
nearly so much as for goods carried in trucks
by the ordinary method. Perhaps Mr. Clapp
will look into it.; his investigations might
give me a little less work and the goods-slied
hands a little more.
* * * *
“Ivir”: The first sale Of Australian gold
by auction took place at the rooms of
.John J. Cohen, 490 George-street, Sydney, on
October 3, 1851, when 2500 z. 4dwt. 14gr.,
chiefly from the Turon and Ophir diggings,
were disposed of in seven lots, realising
£B3O. The pocket gold brought £3 3s. 6d.
per oz. and nuggets were knocked down at
£2 Bs. 6d. to £3 4s. 9d. per oz. The first
ship known to have taken Australian gold
to England was the Aberdeen White Star
liner Phoenician, which left Sydney on Feb-
ruary 3, 1852, carrying £Bl,OOO worth of
bullion. She reached her destination after
a passage of 83 days.
* * * *
“Kobbi” : The Imperial Press party in its
breathless rush north as far as Rockhamp-
ton —which is hardly north- at all—paused at
Bundaberg to get a glimpse of the invention
of R. S. Falkiner' for reducing cane-cutting
costs. It is a tank-like machine of about
four tons weight, and it is claimed that it
can chop the juice-sticks out and behead
them for Is. a ton as compared with the
present rate of Bs. for hand labor. Lady
Burnham showered her blessings on it and
said it was wonderful. Falkiner is a pas-
toralist with no interest in sugar who is
reputed to have lavished £30,000 in the ex-
periments that culminated in this machine.
But a nought may have been carelessly
dropped in somewhere.

Mr. Compton Mackenzie—
Well-known author, fearless critic anti
Editor of “THE GRAMOPHONE”
(England),
writes in that journal as follows:
\
“I have been enormously impressed by my
first experience with the Edison instrument and
Edison Records. The first thing that got me
was the piano record. I have never heard any
piano record to touch it for realism. I then
tried Claudia Muzio in a couple of arias, and
I could not believe it was the same voice I had
heard attributed to her on other records. A
harp record was astonishing. As for jazz bands,
all the jazz bands I have heard on the gramo-
phone sound like tin kettles by comparison. -I
am pretty hard bitten in the w r ay of gramophone
improvements, but the jazz bands of the Edison
HAVE AMAZED ME.”

The Secret of Easy Shaving;
ďfd
Do you want quick,
easy, pleasant shaves ?
Do you want to keep
your face in the pink
of condition, free from
pimples, ingrowing
hairs or cuts ? Then
set your razor on a
PERFORATED HONE.
Take your finest blade or your
poorest; give it a few strokes
or hone all day, the result will
be the same—a perfect shave.
The holes PREVENT WIRE
EDGE, and automatically pro-
duce a perfect, keen shaving
edge.
Try the Perforated Hone.
If it doesn’t make your razor shave to
satisfaction, return it to tfs within SO
days and you get vour money back.

Quick Changes Come
When you fight film on teeth
Again we urge you to see what
benefits come through this new way
of teeth cleaning.
To men and women whiter teeth,
to children new protection. To all
a sense of cleanliness they never knew
before.
Let this free test bring to your home
a new dental eta.
Film keeps teeth unclean
Film is that viscous coat you feel.
Under old methods, much of it clings
and stays. Food stains, etc., discolour
it, then it forms dingy coats. That is
what makes so many teeth unsightly.
Film also holds food substance
which ferments and forms acid. Germs
breed by millions in it. They, with
tartar, are the chief cuase of pyorrhea.
Very few people who brush teeth
in old ways escape those film-caused
troubles.
Modern science has discovered two
ways to fight that film. One disin-
tegrates the film at all stages of forma-
tion. One removes it without harmful
scouring.
Those methods have proved very
effective. A new-type tooth paste has
been created to apply them daily. The
name is Pepsodent.
New beauty comes,
new daintiness
Send the form for a 10-Day Tube.
Note how clean the teeth feel after
using.
Compare this new way with the old.
Judge what is best in your home, by
what you see and feel. Cut out form
now.

AH1547
“H.S.”: Paddy Minahan, Labor M.L.A.
for Sydney, once endeavored to legalise the
game of two-up by Parliamentary action. At
the time his notice of motion was pending
he was created a Knight of St. Gregory.
Still, it may have been for other things that
his Holiness ennobled him.
“Stellsby”: Though many Crimean vete-
rans are mentioned, only one survivor of
the charge of the Light Brigade is drawing
a pension from the Itoyal Patriotic Fund.
Troop Sergt.-Major Edwin Hughes, 13th
Hussars, is the official last survivor of Cardi-
gan's men. He is 94, and draws his £65
p.a. at Blackpool (Eng.).
The former home of W. H. Greene, at
lvyneton (Vic.), has been acquired for school
purposes. Greene was a Commissioner with
Speight and Ford when the three were sus-
pended by the Shiels Government in March,
1892, for failing to run the railways to the
liking of the Ministry and David Syme.
Speight got compensation, and then spent
the amount (approximately £6000) and as
much more as he could raise in suing the
Age for libel. Greene, who was previously
chief engineer in the department, retired to
Kyneton on a pension.
“Analyst”: Despite admitted excellence of
Australian brandies and whiskies, the local
distiller has had little success with gin.
Doubtless this is due to the essential juniper-
berry never having been cultivated in this
country with any degree of success. The
imported berries are far from fresh when
used, and as their oils and ethers are ex-
tremely volatile, a large part of them is
lost by deterioration. To make it worse,
synthetic and faked juniper-oils have been
added directly to alcohol, instead of being
distilled with it, and the product sold as
gin, which it decidedly isn't.
“Bio” : No city in Australia has seen such
a revolution in pub nomenclature as Hobart.
When I was a boy such signs as the Black
Bull, the White Pheasant, the Pig and
Whistle, Steam Hammer, Hope and Anchor,
Waggon and Horses, Ye Olde Commodore,
the Old Bell, Man at the Wheel, the Bright
Smile and the Harvest Home were familiar.
Of the lot I think only the Waggon and
Horses remains. Now you find the Orient,
Arcadia, Victoria, Criterion, Palace and so
forth. Among the old-time inns was the
Hole in the Wall, kept by Jimmie Ogilvie,
father of the present Attorney-General of the
Speck, who was born there.
“Burrawong”: Dr. Coen, the presiding
spirit of the dissecting rooms at the Sydney
Medical School, spends most of his spare
time on liis orchard at the Hawkesbury.
He has probably supervised the dissection
of more bodies than any other man in Aus-
tralia, and his experience and observation
have enabled him to correct several errors in
standard anatomical works. His latest is
the discovery of 10 (and in cases 12) layers
of tissue in the temporal region of the skull.
One student put it in an examination paper:
“Cunningham’s ‘Anatomy’ gives seven layers
of tissue in the temporal region. Barney
Coen says there are 10. Barney is prob-
ably right.”
“T.P.”: There was a great gathering of
the clans at Daylesford (Vic.) for the jubilee
of the State School, and the names of the
old pioneers generally started with Tre, Pol
or Pen. An enlarged photo of Geddie Pearse,
who opened the school 50 years ago, was
presented by the oldsters. A leading school-
master of those far-back days, he was made
inspector, and died soon afterwards at the
age of 40. His brothers and sisters, almost
without exception, fell in with the family
rule of longevity. Tom, the eldest brother,
passed out not long since aged 100, whilst
the youngsters of the family, Dick, several
times Mayor of Ballarat, and Joe, a big
landowner in the Donald district, are still
going strong.
“H.P.”: “L.E.’s” description of artist
Louis Buvelot as a gentle, cultured man
(B. 17/9/’25) fits in exactly with my
parents’ description of him. When Buvelot
was on a visit to Coleraine (Vic.) in 1868
my father and mother lived in the same house
with him. Here it was that he selected the
scene for his “Waterpool at Coleraine,” hung
in the Buvelot Gallery of the National
Gallery, Melbourne. I was born close to
the waterpool in the year it was painted.
The hills behind which the sun is setting
were part of Edward Henty’s famous Mun-
than estate. The pool is now a
mere waterhole, used in connection with —of
all things to be associated with the gentle
Buvelot —a butcher’s slaughterhouse!
“Nikko”: The Sydney magistrate becomes
kinder and kinder. Recently a P.O. em-
ployee caught abstracting postal-notes from
letters was lightly dealt with by the S.M. on
the ground of overwhelming temptation, and
the person who had posted the notes was re-
proved for sending them in an ordinary let-
ter. As postal-notes of small value are
rarely registered the decision suggests that
any postal employee who is similarly dis-
honest may rely on having allowances made
for him. In another case a woman caught
shop-lifting was leniently dealt with on the
ground that the method of displaying goods
in drapery establishments provided great
temptation to some people. If this new un-
written law is to spread we shall have magis-
trates abusing the boss for permitting junior
clerks to have charge of the petty cash, and
reprimanding bank directors for allowing
tellers to handle money.
“Two Seas”: The Backblocks are haunted
by city fakirs who are for ever devising new
modes of separating Cocky from his roll.
The latest I’ve struck is a plausible gentle-
man who exhibits samples of calico, towel-
ling, socks, collars, etc., all of good quality
and well-known brands. He carefully books
your order, and then introduces suit-lengths.
He has a stock of these in his car. You
know the calico, etc., are absurdly cheap at
the prices asked; you imagine the suit-
lengths are bargains, too. You may or may
not buy the shoddy on the spot; but, in any
case, you never get the other things you
ordered. Some time ago a very clever scheme
was worked on the N.S.W. northern line.
Dozens of suit-lengths were sold in bush
townships, the inducement to buy being the
assurance that a squad of tailors employed
by “the company” to make the lengths up
into suits at a pound a time was at work
in the next township, and would be along in
due course. Unfortunately the tailors never
caught up with the salesman.

WAX Your Floors
and they'll he beautiful

be easily and quickly rewaxed as worn spots

POLISHING WAX
Johnson’s Polishing Wax imparts a beautiful,
hard, durable, disinfecting finish which is im-
pervious to water, dust, scratches, heel-marks,
etc. It cleans, polishes, preserves and protects
—all in one operation.
YOUR LINOLEUM will last longer—look
better and clean much easier if polished occa-
sionally with Johnson’s Paste or Liquid Wax.
A Perfect Furniture Polish
JOHNSON’S LIQUID WAX is the ideal furniture polish.
It bestows a dry, velvety, glass-like lustre which will not
gather dust and lint, or show finger prints. Johnson’s
Liquid Wax takes all the drudgery from dusting. It adds
years to the life and beauty of varnish.
Johnson’s Polishing Wax
is conveniently put up in
three forms. Use the
Paste Wax for all floors—
wood, linoleum, tile, etc.
We recommend the Liquid
Wax for polishing furn-
iture, phonographs, wood-
work, linoleum, leather and
motor cars. Johnson’s Pow-
dered Wax will immedi-
ately put any floor in per-
fect condition for dancing.

stitute. For sale at leading
stores. If you cannot
purchase Johnson’s Wax
from your local dealer—
write us, mentioning his
name and we will see that
you are promptly supplied.
The easy way to wax floors and linoleum is with a
Johnson Weighted Polishing Brush. It spreads the Wax
evenly —polishes the'floor easily—and is an ideal floor duster.

In Dark Gardens.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rriHE children brought field daisies in.
White frills about a yellow face;
They brought her broom from stony
bills,
And violets of a marshy place;
But still before her spinning-wheel,
l.istless she sat with unwound reel.
She would not heed the chapel bell,
She moved as in a waking' dream.
But sometimes by the sapphire lake.
Where through the reeds the iris gleam.
She leaned as though in that hushed houi
She sought for some forgotten flower.
At times, with summer on the. wold.
And drumming bees in jasmines blown,
She took her basket on her arm
And went into the woods alone;
Weeping, came back by lane and lull,
Her willow basket empty still.
To none she spoke her secret grief.
Always her sad eyes seemed to seek.
The grand-dad muttered from his chair,
With words of strange import to speak,
He said : “ ’Tis thus the maiden goes
Who in dark gardens found a rose.
The moon came up above the town;
It silvered spire and fretted root.
And man and maid danced on the grass.
And only she remained aloof.
A branch cast shadow on the ground,
And swift she bent, as though she found
A petal in the darkness flung
Of some fair bloom she once had known.
Almost her lips curved to a smile;
Then, with drooped head, we heard her
moan,
And saw her, as the widowed stand,
With famished eyes and empty hand.
More glad she grew in wihter-time,.
And at her wheel we heard her sing.
For all the flowers were lost in snow.
But grief came back with every Spring;
She seemed again to feel her dearth
When the first blade pricked through the
earth.
Her foster-brother loved her well;
ITe would have kist her mouth to glows,
But lily-pale and cold she kept
Who in the dark had found a rose
That grows not in a marriage bed.
And so he wedded Jean instead.
When fecund earth was greatly green.
And birds sang in the dusky wood.
And there were rabbits in the copse,
And grain grew gold and life was good,
At the long close of one rare day
Into the mirk she stole away.
The grand-dad with liis ninety years,
Palsied these ten. sat watching her;
The sun went down behind the hills;
He heard the gloaming insects whir; •
He saw bright eve her eyelids close,
And sobbed, and muttered of a rose.
Perhaps, beyond the bluest peak,
In some dark vale she found her flower;
Perhaps her hungry heart was filled —-
We never saw her from that hour.
So long ago—old memories fail —
Almost a legend seems the tale!

The children brought white daisies in
With frills about a yellow face;
They brought her broom from stony hills
And violets from a marshy place;
But only weeds are these to those
Who in dark gardens found a rose.

M. FORREST.
The Death Sentence.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
uT’LL have to get rid of the brute,” said
McDurmer savagely. “This is the
dead finish.”
1-Ie did not like dogs. He had conceived
a particular dislike for this one ever since
young Jos had brought it home from school
in his bag, a shapeless puppy, and in the
months it had been growing it had_ given
him more trouble than enough. Big and
slobbering, with a lolling tongue and a droop
of the right eyelid, it had never quite got
over its distemper, and seemed to be suffer-
ing from a softened brain. _ On countless
occasions its half-witted curiosity had pushed
McDurmer to the limits of exasperation. It
had a passion for chewing the straps of the
new harness, for chasing.the neighbors’ sheep,
for nipping the heels of horses that were tied
to the fence and making them break their
bridles. Whenever he talked of getting rid
of it, though, the boy protested violently,
sometimes with tears.
But now a crisis had been reached. Ho
had come across his best Leghorn rooster
lying under a peach-tree with its neck-
feathers covered in blood.
“It’s the dead finish,” he repeated to his
wife. “I’ve suffered enough from that useless
mongrel. I’m going to take it down to the
gully this morning and put a charge of shot
into it.”
“Young Jos will cry his eyes out if he
hears you talk like that,” said the woman
waveriiigly. “He thinks the world of that
dog.”
“He doesn't liavo to foot the bill, growled
McDurmer. “I’ve had rows with the neigh-
bors about the brute ever since the boy
brought it here. And now it’s taken to kill-
ing fowls! I ought to have pumped a few
slugs of lead into it months ago.”
“Well, don’t tell Jos,” his wife pleaded
as she laid the table. “Wait till he’s gone
to school.”
McDurmer retorted that it was no use
pandering to the boy. “I’ve warned him
what I was going to do,” he said, “and if
he doesn’t like it he can lump it. But I’m
not going to rub it in. When it doesn’t come
home he’ll think it’s taken a bait. Old
Weinhert’s threatened to lay one for it often
enough.” . *
At breakfast he did not say anything about
the dead rooster, and young Jos went off
up the track without suspicion, his bag
over his shoulder and a stone in his shanghai.
In the sun by the buggy-shed lay the dog,
snapping at flies, and watching the young
turkeys inside the wire-fence with a mali-
cious interest. He seemed to be waiting for
the time when one of them would stray
through the wires and allow him to give it
the fright of its life. A dog with no morals,
McDurmer reflected, watching its restless
eyes and brainless forehead! The prey of
every vicious desire that flickered through
its shapeless skull! Probably it was the off-
shoot of a degenerate criminal breed —sheep-
killers and meat-stealers.
“Here! Come on, Snip!'' he called, pick-
ing up his axe and his gun, and making for
the gully.
The dog followed him cheerfully enough,
running on ahead and chasing the birds that
were flying low; but from time to time it
stopped and looked curiously at McDurmer,
its head on one side. It seemed a little
puzzled by the gun, and there was almost the
light of a dawning intelligence in its eyes.
Or was it merely the low cunning of its
breed, stimulated by a consciousness of sin?
As they went on further toward the log Mc-
Durmer had been splitting the day before,
it increased its distance from the man, keep-
ing behind a thin cover of bushes.
“The brute knows something’s in the
wind,” thought McDurmer. “Trust a mon-
grel like that to use its brains when it’s a
case of saving its own skin. Here, Snip!
Good old dog!”
He sat down on the log with his gun be-
tween his knees and tried to coax the dog
toward him, but it approached a little and
then danced away. A queer excitement
seemed to invade its body, and its long hair
looked ruffled and electric, while a troubled
whine came from its throat. Round and
round the log it scouted, keeping just out of
range of his gun, and occasionally standing
still to watch him with a bewildered scru-
tiny. “Can I trust you?” it seemed to say.
“No, I don’t believe I can. What are you
fingering that gun for?” McDurmer put the
gun down and began to look for his maul
and wedges under the sheet of bark where
he had left them. There was no hurry. He
was not going to botch the job, and some
time during the morning he would get his
chance. As far as animals were concerned,
there had never been any sentiment about
him, but lie did not relish the idea of the
dog getting away with a few scattered shot
in it.
“There’s plenty time,” he told himself.
“It’ll be nosing round after the tucker-bag
soon.”
It was then that the disaster happened.
He was fishing for a wedge in the half-split
log when something slipped and he felt a
sudden pressure on his arm. So acute was
the pain that a cry almost broke from his
lips, and when he tried to release himself
he found he was held fast.
“Damn that wedge!” he muttered. “That’s
what comes of leaving a job half-done.”
So tightly was his arm gripped by the
closing log that he could not even change
his position ; when he tried to reach for his
maul he felt a disturbing flutter in his left
side, a queer movement of the heart. The
old weakness! Any undue effort, the doctor
in the township had told him.... There
was a sudden wash of blood about his brain,
and the world began to spin around like a
top. He had fainted.
A little later, when his mind cleared and
his eyes opened, he saw the dog sitting a
few yards away, gazing at him with the same
curious intentness it had shown in watching
the young turkeys inside the wire-fence. But
it had swollen in size, and no longer looked
an overgrown puppy. Its head was fixed a
little on one side, its tongue lolled out, and
its right eyelid drooped with a peculiar ex-
pression of knowingness. To McDurmer
that slobbering grin had a deadly malice in
it —the malice of a half-witted mind. He
remembered his oven intention of half an hour
before, and when 'the dog squirmed a little
nearer the sweat broke out on his forehead.
“Get out, you mongrel!” he cried, reach-
ing for a chip.
But the pain of the effort nearly made him
swoon again. The dog whined a little, and
then, moving nearer, gave vent to its feel-
ings in a few short,' excited barks. It sat
down so close to McDurmer that it almost
blotted out the rest of the landscape. He
felt its warm breath on his face; his senses
were assailed by its musty, doggy smell.
For almost the first time in his life his
imagination was working at high pressure,
and when it sidled a little closer to him he
remembered the rooster lying under the
peach-tree with blood on its neck-feathers.
“Get out, you murdering swine!” he
roared again.
The gun was lying by the log not far
away from him, and straining his body he
touched the stock with his foot. It was
loaded in both barrels, he reflected; he had
loaded it before he started out. Not that
the knowledge gave him much relief! A
shot would not bring anyone to his aid, for
he was a mile away from home, and, besides.
Maggie would be expecting to hear the sound
of a gun. It was unlikely she would be
anxious about him till sundown, and even
then she wouldn’t know exactly where he
had been working.
Stretching out his foot again he drew the
gun a little nearer to him. The sun was beat-
ing down on the back of his neck, and he felt
a muzziness in his brain, but his whole
attention was fixed on the dog. A queer
madness seemed to possess it when it saw
him move the gun. It rushed in. snapping
at the barrel and then dancing off. The fur
of its coat bristled; an insane light came
into its eyes; slaver dripped from its mouth.
Prowling around him in a circle it whined
and barked alternately, its whole body torn
by some obscure frenzy.
“If only I could lift that gun to my
shoulder!” thought McDurmer, his eyes
fixed on the dog’s sloping forehead.
As his fingers fumbled with the hammers
the dog danced off like a butterfly, seeming
to vanish into the shimmering air above
him. So highly-strung were McDurmer’s
nerves that the report was like a smashing
blow on his ear-drums, and then a wave of
unconsciousness swept over him. What had
happened? The world around him had sud-
denly grown still, deadly still, and it was as
if the torpor that enveloped him had lasted
for eternity.
“I’ve shot myself,” he thought vaguely.
“Shot myself and the dog too! This is the
end.”
And then he had a sudden vision of young
Jos’s face. Jos was bending down beside

him crying— not for him, but for the dog.
Curious what affection that useless brute
had aroused in the boy! There were voices
in his ears, arguing about something, but he
could not quite make out what they were
saying. He felt himself being pulled about
roughly. Had the dog come to life again,
and was it worrying his helpless body? He
lifted his crushed arm in defence, and to
his surprise it came free!
“All right now, Mac?” he was conscious
of being asked.
He felt the world swim back to him and
sat up dazedly.
“Yes, I’m all right,” he heard something
respond, deep down in his throat.
Two of the fencers from over the creek
were standing near by, one with a crowbar,
the other pouring water on his head from a
canvas bag. He was overcome by a humili-
ating sense of having let his weakness get the
better of him.
“We heard the shot,” explained one of the
fencers, “but we didn’t think it meant any-
thing. It wasn’t till that there dog showed
up that we guessed something was wrong.
Lord, it’s got as much brains as a white
man, that dog! Wouldn’t give us any peace
till we came wfitli it. You don’t happen to
want to sell it, I s’pose? I’ve been looking
out for a good dog.”
McDurmer glanced over to where Snip
was sitting by the log, watching the group
with its usual slobbering grin.
“Sell it?” he repeated with sudden vehe-
mence. “What do you think? There’s not
enough money around here to buy that dog.
Besides, it belongs to my boy.”
VANCE PALMER
The Selector’s Daughter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A MBLER’S wife, a dry wisp of a woman
/■% with weak eyes, was peeling pota-
toes for the evening meal. Her
daughter Lena, lounging at the other end of
the table, watched lazily the knife flash in
and out of the dish. She had already started
the fire and cut the bread, so her task was
finished. The woman dropped the knife and
ran her eyes over the naked potatoes sub-
merged in the water.
“Four, live, six. That oughter be enough.
Yer father won’t want much. An’ if yer
ask me ’e’ll be wantin’ less before long.”
“You’re always going on,” answered the
girl. “Why don’t you stop it? Dad'll be
all right.”
“I don’t want anyer impudence,” said her
mother. “I know more than you. The black
colt ’asn’t left the gate all the afternoon.”
“More nonsense,” snapped Lena, a rebel-
lious look passing across her face.
“What yer sayin’, ‘nonsense’? The time
yer Uncle Jim was bad didn’t the black colt
carry on jes’ tin; same? An’ the moment
lie died it broke inter the most awful ’owlin’
yer ever ’card in yer life. These things
’appen. ’Ave less to say an’ take that
mutton outer the oven.”
The mutton was placed on the table. Soon
the potatoes were boiling, and Lena, running
off the water, emptied them on to a plate.
Her mother carried a little of the steaming
victuals across the yard to the house w'here
Ambler lay sick unto death. That morning
he had fallen from the plough, tumbling in
among the frightened horses until their
hooves had battered him into insensibility.
An hour since he had awakened to a hazy
consciousness. He turned slightly as his
wife entered the room.
“ ’Ere’s a bit o’ mutton, John,” she said,
placing the plate on a chair near the bed.
He was very weak, and, as she tried to
feed him, with an angry swing of his arm
he sent the plate clattering along the floor.
The woman snuffled as she gathered the
pieces.
Still she grieved for John : she could not
help it when she looked upon his gaunt,
bearded face. There was a particular poig-
nancy in the sight of such an elephant of
a man lying helpless, huddled in the bed
like a child. He had always been so strong,
so contemptuous of danger. With but his
own labor he had carved the selection out of
the thick scrub, had built the house and had
erected buggy-shed and stables, whitewashing
the walls so that they shone in the sun. Now
the weight of a blanket on his chest hurt
him. His wife endeavored to adjust the
pillows so as to make him more comfortable:
but he swore at her. As soon as his eyes
closed she stole away, still clinging to the
broken plate.
Lena and her mother had nearly finished
their tea when they were disturbed by the
beating of hooves.
“Tom !” the girl said, returning from the
window.
“Remember what yer father told yer,” she
snapped. “Yer gotter give ’im no encourage-
ment.”
A gawky, freckled chap, towny of hair,
appeared in the doorway. He smiled at
Lena and greeted her mother. “ ’Ow’s the
ole feller?” he asked.
“Pretty bad, Tom,” she drawled. “I think
it's a case.”
Tom hardly heard her. His eyes—doting,
stupid eyes—followed the girl around the
room, and he only desisted when he dis-
covered that her mother was watching him.
Blushing, and hardly aware of what he did. he
began snatching at the flies that swam
through the atmosphere.
When his emotion had subsided a little ho
managed to say: “I was passin’ an’ J
thought I’d look in an’ see ’ow ’e was gettin’
on.”
His voice had a strange ring about it.
Afraid that the lie might be too palpable he
waved a fatuous farewell, and left the door.
From the window Lena watched him ride
away, watched the easy motion of his horse,
its haunches rising and falling rhythmically.
He contracted to a sombre figure swaying in
a sombfe haze. The greater part of the sky
was overcast, dead, and upon the earth lay
a noiseless calm. From beneath a bank of
cloud in the west streamed a radiance as
through a, colored window, flinging a crimson
shadow along the tops of the hills behind the
house. Light, red as wine, spilled across the
crests, and ran to waste among crumbling,
rock-hewn altars. Gum-trees were gilded like
pictures. The wine grew dark and cold ; the
hills gave up their splendor. In the twilight
the patches of scrub near the house looked
like old dead things, waiting, envious of the
things that lived. Somewhere a cow lowed
softly, and the rustle of wings sounded among
the fowls roosting on the woodheap. Lena
looked again for Tom, but he had dis-
appeared. Just behind her she could hear
the whine of her mother’s voice.
“It’s no good talkin’,” she was crying.
“It’s seven o’clock, an’ the things ain’t
cleared or nothin’.”
Lena removed the various articles from the
table, and washed them, while her mother
went back to the house.
When the last of the plates had been
stowed aw r ay the girl lit a candle and.
hurrying to the mirror behind the door,
rubbed her face with a wet towel. Then she
ran her fingers quickly through her hair,
brushing it back from her forehead. Vanity
as potent as a drug warmed all the spaces
of her body. Her flesh was soft and golden
like a flower; her eyes were like dark dew.
Her toilet completed, she stood at the door
and listened. All that she could hear were
the groans and curses of her father. Step-
ping back into the kitchen she doused the
candle and, closing the door behind her,
hastened away towards the road. The black
colt still stood at the gate. From the culti-
vation paddock came the scent of hay, ming-
ling with the dry smell of dust and dead
leaves.
On a bridge that spanned a waterless creek
just beyond the gate Tom was waiting.
With hands clasped they left the road, and,
clambering through the undergrowth on the
bank of the creek, sat down beneath a
wattle-tree.
Tom passed his arm around the girl’s un-
yielding body.
She turned her head away, saying: “Tom,
I can’t meet you any more after to-night.
Dad won’t hear of me marrying you at any
price. You saw how he went on this morn-
ing?”
“That’s all right,” replied Tom. “Never
mind ’im. It’ll be all right.”
“It’s no good talking, I’ve got to give you
up,” she persisted.
“Yer ain’t,” he growled. “Think I’m goin’
to let yer take the bit in yer teeth like that?”
But Lena was resolute. Fear of her
father had strengthened her determination.
Ever since childhood she had been in the
habit of cowering before her parent’s coin-
minatory bulk. He was a man with a fierce
temper, and whatever he said was irrevo-
cable. Lena knew that, just as she knew
that to persist would assuredly draw down
suffering and misery upon both. Besides,
she w’as not quite sure whether she really
loved Tom. She liked him well enough:
there was a certain allure about the sub-
dued animalism that lurked in his strong,
bony frame. But that was not love. And
now that she was about to part from him
she discovered that she was not as greatly
perturbed as she should have been. That
was another sign.
“Yer ain’t. Yer ain’t,” he whispered,
pressing her head against his shoulder.
But; his words sounded horribly futile.
They left her impassive. That she would
not see him after that night was a stark
fact that all his hysteria was powerless to
alter. She despised his theatricalism; sin
wanted the parting to be quiet. When,
however, she fought against him she was
immediately made conscious of a power
greater than her own.
Releasing her head slightly, he looked into
her face. His eyes were dilated, his features
distorted. She was afraid of him now,
afraid of that shaggy shape, primitive, ele-
mental. He hurt her with his unshaven
chin, rubbing it across her cheeks. His pon-
derous hands fumbled, seeking her body.
Desperate, Lena dug her fingers into his
eyes, and escaped.
Crawling from his clutches she crouched,
kneeling on the ground, a few yards away.
Her fear left her. She realised a maternal
protectiveness in the gloom beneath the
trees, in the leafy sounds, in the infinite,
wind-cold spaces.
Tom bent towards her, breathing heavily.
As if mutually fascinated they gazed long at
each other without speaking. At last Tom
relaxed.
“ Ow was the ole feller to-night?” he
asked.
Lena felt like laughing. How was the old
fellow!
'He was groaning a bit,” she said. Her
voice was so calm and natural it surprised
her.
"Yer think ’e fell off the plough, eh?”
continued Tom. “Well, ’e didn’t. I pushed
’im.”
“You !” she cried. “Why? What”
“ 'Cause I saw ’im beatin’ yer with the
whip this mornin’, that’s why. I waited me
chance, an’ then I pushed ’im—pushed ’im
’ard.” He put out his hand, shoving it down
in the dark.
Lena’s eyes opbned wide. A look of sur-
render crept up through their depths. Her
arms fluttered towards him.
Far away a horse was whinnying madly.

Where spirits know the bliss of sweet release,
While hands may join and while our smiling
lips
As calmly meet as our cool finger-tip*,
Here walk we, folded in the silent peac**
Of love too perfect grown to fear decrease—
A sphere serene, where flesh is in eclipse,
Where joy of love a poet’s dream outstrips—
A realm beyond the compass of caprice!
Here we may love, and the w r ise world not
know—
Such laughter in each other’s eyes we read!
Then, as the dawn wakes earth and earth
sounds grow,
We sigh apart, and, smiling, cross the mead
Of glory lit with love’s triumphant bow
Set o’er fulfilment, deathless, Heaven-decreed!
