Hot-Cross-Buns
Once again the Christian world has cele-
brated its greatest event by eating a bun.
.Loir ag > there were strange murmurings
ame ; g euief priests and persons wise in
am k religion, questionings and heart-
bin .lings and 'agonies under the olives in a
tl ; garden below the wall of Jerusalem, a
trial ai;tfv midnight around the brazier in a
great house which held many secrets, an
open trial before a bored Roman who tried
to balance justice and popular esteem, and
at last a» execution in the full sunshine on
a little hill near the northern gate. The
events of that night and morning changed
the world, made the light of the stars seem
new, altered all moral values, set in motion
forces that have not yet spent themselves,
forces that crushed the Roman Empire to
small dust and exalted an ideal above a
sword. The world knows these filings to its
remotest corner; in speaking of them it
lowers its voice and enunciates its syllables
with ca*>e. For the sake of them and all
that they thought the things might mean,
countless thousands of men have died —some
at the stake, some torn by the beasts in the
arena, more in the test of bitterly-fought
battle. _ By the power which emanated from
that night and morning new systems have
been evolved —religions, philosophies, em-
pires, economic theories, heavens and hells.
Great architectural wonders have been
created in memory of the events; they have
been the inspiration of many of the noblest
things in art. Dreaming of them, mankind
has found a strange impulse towards kindli-
ness, towards truth, towards an individual-
ism of sacrifice. Count back 20 of the finest
things in the human history of the last 2000
years, and 18 of them will be in some way
related to those foundation Christian hap-
penings. The smashing of the Persian host
at Salamis, the arrest of the Turkish
advance on the Danube, the victory of
Waterloo, and even the crowning achieve-
ment of the last and greatest war seem
events of comparatively small moment when
compared with the minor sensation that
shook Jerusalem for an hour and then pro-
ceeded to turn the world upside down.
Recognising the stupendous importance of
the Crucifixion, the Christian world eats a
ban.!
This bun-eating is very characteristic of
the race of man. The religious impulse is
always held down and restrained by the
immediate need of bread-and-butter, the
trumpet-call of beer or the vague wonder of
the citizen as to how his income-tax will be
paid. The cares of this world are so insis-
tent that there is very little time to get a
serious grip of anything else; but always
there is the feeling that something should be
done about those other things, and the result
is a compromise. The earliest Christian age
did not compromise at all. It took to dying
under painful and spectacular circumstances
with a curious enthusiasm. The next age,
however, made a calm survey of the Sermon
on the Mount, and decided that it could not
rise to the heights demanded. It built
cathedrals as a compromise, because it was
easier to put stones together and make
stained glass than to put the Golden Rule
to its full test. The age which followed
that did not worry much about cathedrals,
but started to make creeds, heresies and far-
spreading wars. These also were in the
nature of compromise. It was far easier
to smash the head of the man who
wouldn’t believe than to obey orders-
as simple and direct as those of ori-
ginal Christianity. Give the man in
the Domain your overcoat; sell all you
have and hand the proceeds to the gentle-
man hanging to the lamp-post; leave your
work at any time to go with anyone who
may ask you to take a stroll—these, trans-
lated into practical language, were the com-
mands. It was far simpler to insist on
some vague thing called faith, and to go out
and kill the man whose view's varied by a
word or two from your own. Compromise
followed compromise as the minds of men
and nations changed in tone and fashion;
but always there was some glimmering recog-
nition that Christianity ought to have its
place. The last phase of that compromise
is a hot-cross-bun; and even from that the
cross begins to fade as the baker’s arm
grows too tired to make the proper mark on
the dough.
Yet strange as that last compromise
seems, and poor as the fading cross on the
bun looks beside that which flamed in the
sunset at a thousand points on the great
cathedral, poor as it is beside the blood-red
cross on the flag that waved before the war-
ring hosts in battle, the essential thing in
Christianity remains. It is so with all
great world-forces that make for something
a little better in actual human practice.
The new movement rolls like a snowball
gathering weight and bulk, adding to itself
all kinds of foreign substances; but melts
at last into the thing it was meant to be at
the first. Christianity gathered in kings
and potentates and robes and orders and
heresies and wealth and power and diplo-
macy and titles and orders and excommuni-
cation and the Nonconformist conscience;
but none of these things was essential.
The real thing with which it set out w r as
a profound faith in man as man—an assur-
ance that everybody was a lot more decent
than he seemed to be; and that, given room
and scope to show his decency, a human
brotherhood was possible. It linked that
with the thought of a God who, for all His
eternal power and glory, was willing to
come into line with that brotherhood. That
idea remains; it grips and holds a big part
of the world to-day. The churches fade,
just as the cross fades from the bun; but
the world never looked more Christian in
the old original sense than it does at the
present moment. There is no reason to
suppose that human faith in humanity—
which in the best Christian sense is faith in
God —weakens because the shows and sym-
bols are left to the baker. It is rather the
other way round. Symbols of the past
stood to teach idealism to very crude minds.
When they are no longer needed it is fair
enough to assume that the minds are no
longer crude, but have taken that idealism
into their inner thinking and made it a pare
of themselves. The bun itself will probably
fade away as the years pass, and the baker
may make a more indigestible jam-tart in
its placet but the change will have no mean-
ing if the little children are sure of their
bread, the strong men free to give their best
to the world, with the nations thinking of bet-
ter things than big armaments and universal
plunder. The dreams of Galilee were blot-
ted out in 24 hours in Jerusalem; but they
are curiously alive up and down the world
to-day. The baker with one dump of his
hand can flatten out the cross on the dough:
but nothing can get it out of the hearts of
men and women who laugh in the sun.
How many millions of men carried that
secret cross right up to the mouths of the
guns V

Poetic License
Among the many useless things which we
have imported are consignments of bad tradi-
tions, such as narrow verandahs, waistcoats,
mayoral robes, legal wigs, titles, Guy Fawkes
days, heavy breakfasts, stiff collars. Govern-
ment Gazettes, respect for our elders, and
poetic license. For the present lam con-
cerned only with poetic license. And I’d like
to propose that it be forthwith jettisoned by
all Australian poets and would-be poets. It
is and always has been an excuse for lazi-
ness, and in no ciise has it ever been justifi-
able. In the beginning some indolent versi-
fier sharp-wittedly used the expression as a
square-off for his technical faults, and all
his successors have been only too willing to
use him as a precedent. I don’t know who
he was and hope I never shall. He doesn’t
deserve to be known. Slovenly writers still
rime “wind” with “behind” ‘ and call it
poetic license. It is as foolish as singling
cut the word “honor” to be pronounced with-
out its “h” just because the people we stole
it. from didn’t deal much in aspirates. Again,
in order to get a rime all sorts of graminatic
acrobatics are indulged in, and the turn is
billed as “poetic license.” Milton is respon-
sible to a great extent for this. He was so
steeped in Latin that he became almost in-
capable of thinking English in its proper
grammatic sequence, and so loaded even his
blank verse, in which there was not the
excuse of rime-chasing, with barbaric inver-
sions. Being a big gun and people being
taught to respect their elders, it was politely
referred to as “poetic license,” and another
evil precedent was established. In fact, it
is. so firmly established that large numbers
of people have a fixed idea that the main
requisite of a poem is to have curvature of
the grammar. Another offence which is
condoned to this day, not only in England
but in Australia, where people ought to know
better, is the riming of the short “e” sound
in the final syllable of such words as “in-
stantly” with the long “i” sound in such
entirely different words as “sky.” To pro-
nounce the word naturally means that ye
get no rime whatever, and,' after all, natural-
ness is one of the first requisites of any genu-
ine verse. If rime is the first consideration
the word has to undergo such contortions
that it resembles a man in corsets. Still
another bad habit is the use of “o’er” for
“over” and “ ’neath” for “beneath.” What
would happen if a bloke told you that you
would find the pub ’neath a gum tree o’er
yonder hill? If an ordinary bloke can speak
without these verbal follies, surely a poet,
who is supposed to be an expert in the use
of words, can do so too. Of course, nearly
all the poetic big nobs have been guilty; but
that is so much to their discredit, not so
much in support of these juggling tricks.
There is. nothing to be said in favor of poetic
license, in which respect it varies from a dog
license. The latter does at least contribute
to the country’s revenue. To need poetic
license is sure firoof that you don’t deserve
a poet’s license.
BARTLETT ADAMSON.
The Playful Hun
Perhaps we have nothing to be proud of
ourselves. Only the other day, after The
Bulletin had said a few words about the
flogging of natives in German New Guinea,
someone wrote saying that he had seen
natives flogged in British New Guinea. Sir
Hugh Clifford, Governor of the Gold Coast,
who writes German Colonies: A Plea for the
Native Races (John Murray), doesn’t pro-
fess that Britain has alwavs been a saint.
What he does insist upon is that the Hun
has gone on being a devil.
To get to a right understanding of his
subject, Governor Clifford traces the history
of colonisation. Asia, of course, was the
only known country that early Europe
could exploit; and the' middleman’s mono-
poly of Asiatic trade, which was established
by Venice and shared by other Italian
States, enriched those who enjoyed it at the
expense of the rest of Christendom. It was
to break through this monopolv that Por-
tugal and Spain crept further and further
down the African coast, while Columbus
sailed westward seeking another track to the
East. The Cornishman has explained that
the better you are the worse you can afford
to be; and these early navigators were
Christian zealots:
They respected no rights of person or of property
Wherever they were strong enough to enforce it they
insisted upon a monopoly alike of commerce and of
power; and in the attainment of their desires they
knew neither pity nor scruple. J
Britain backed the wrong horse once more
Somehow the British tendency is always to
fly away from the Tropics and gravitate
towards the Poles. We see it to our great
loss in Australia. The Sixteenth Century
saw it—always a struggle to reach Asia by
creeping along the frozen north of Europe
or new-found America. It was not till after
the defeat of the Armada that Britain
looked south ; and there was a speedy result
m the granting of its first charter to the
British East India Co. in 1599. The Dutch
East India Co. was four years its senior. At
the outset, being the representatives of
Protestant nations in rivalry with Catholic
nations, the two companies worked more or
less m harmony. But by slow degrees thev
developed principles of their own. Clifford

An Etching.
The room is still, as I with lamp and book
Turn for your eyes, and meet their long,
still look
Answering to mine. And never this you
miss—
Thought for my thought, and unkissed kiss
for kiss.
Outside, the night and all the world’s sad
gloom;
And you and I, a book-lined, lamp-lit room,
Tired from the day, filled with achievement’s
store,
Seeking each other, needing always more!
A little wearily sometimes you come
Back to my waiting heart, the long day done,
Needing my spirit and my waiting arms,
Ever your refuge from this life’s alarms.
Sometimes we speak a word, or silent stay,
Ego attending ego, as it may,
In peace too dear for words; one turns a page
And reads aloud a line from poet or sage.
O Dream, that like a sigh lies on my heart,
Shedding a perfume that my sad soul knows,
Stay with me till my faltering spirit goes
Once more adventuring, with Death for
chart!
Ah, lean your cheek against my cheek again,
My fabled lover (both our cheeks how wet!)
With yearning and with silence, and the
fret
Of spirit-loneliness—that woman’s pain !
The room is still, as I with lamp and book
Turn for your eyes—and meet a stranger’s
look,
Uncaring mine; and, gazing back the years,
My eyes grow blinded with slow-dropping
tear 3.

A Good Day.
A tender smoke
Above the green of trees,
An axeman’s stroke,
A sound of birds and bees;
And the low tinkle
Of a hidden stream,
Pausing to sprinkle
Fern leaves with its dream.
A tender smoke
Above a wheel-worn glade.
A child’s voice broke
The silence evening made.
Children and laughter!
Bless the smoky sun
And the stars after
For one day well done!

The World.
So brave a face I give the world
That pries to seek my weakness out,
But parrying its praise or blame,
That search I only care to flout;
And, hiding all my broken ships,
I face its stare with steady lips.
I have one window for the world
As narrow as an oubliette.
But wide towards the splendid stars
My roofless house at night is set;
The stars have seen the hurt that sears,
And they are brighter for my tears.
So brave a face I give the world,
My door is locked against them all;
I have for them no wicket gate
Though they entice across the wall;
But every barrier back I move
To make a way for those I love!
I have no bargains for the world.
The price I name is high to pay;
But I would stretch my hands to Love
If he as beggar came my way!
Make fast against the world my bars
That it may leave me love and stars.

The Master Problem.
I saw a ship against the east,
Made rosy by the glowing morn,
Her full sails swelling in the breeze,
Her wake a w'ay of creamy yeast;
While nigh me, in the she-oak trees,
The warblers told that uay was born.
Now, where she sped, to what far clime,
Or whence she came I did not guess;
W hy should I seek the whence and where,
Since thinking much is weariness,
And loads the buoyant hour with care,
And makes us old before our time?
I saw a rider on a ridge.
Outlined against the setting sun;
Full-stretch he galloped on his way,
W hile, overhead, a golden bridge
Of cloud across the azure lay,
And warblers told that day was done.
Now. whence he rode I did not know,
Nor where he sped I did not guess—
That horseman on the timbered line,
A shape against the sunset glow.
For little, profit would be mine,
And thinking much is weariness.
But when my couch at night I sought,
And darkness gathered chill, intense.
, rn '' Th winds that whispered plaintivelv.

The master problem fronted me—

THE LEAGUE OF PLATITUDES.
The League of Nations scheme was scuffled
through in order that it might be tagged on
to the Peace Treaty, and the published draft,
which has at last come to light, has all the
earmarks of haste and compromise. The
reasons for hurry were obvious. The League
was Woodrow Wilson’s pet academical
idea. It was to be the climax and coping-
stone of a career which, until within the last
year or so, when accident hustled him out of
his rut, had been drab and uneventful. It
was to be his beacon and landmark; the big
drum and brass trumpet of his fame; also
the pyramid over his bones. Without it to
talk about his place at the Peace Confer-
ence would have been in a back seat; for his
country had no unredeemed provinces to re-
cover, no boundaries to be readjusted, no
wrecked cities to be repaired, and hardly any
indemnity to collect. It hadn’t even much
militarism to complain of, for the big Hun
guns had never threatened its borders. So
the League was Wilson’s ticket of admis-
sion to the front of the house, and he made
the most of it. Circumstances, however,
were against any real League. The Italian
and Uie Serb aren’t certain even yet whether
they won’t fight over the boundary question.
Japan wants to know how far a League may
allow it to have its way with China, and
China wants to know whether the League
will help it to work out its salvation in its
own way. Therefore four Powers, to begin
with, weren’t ready to sign away their free-
dom of action. They certainly didn’t want
to contribute to a League army and navy
without knowing whether its guns would be
pointed at them or not, and until the peace
terms were signed they couldn’t know. They
didn’t want to disarm, or to promise to dis-
arm until they knew whether they would be
protected or sacrificed. Other Powers, like
France, asked anxiously how many men
and dollars the U.S. would back its scheme
with and got little satisfaction. It was a
putting of‘ the cart before _ the horse, this
forming of a combine of nations before a lot
of them were sufficiently defined to know
what sort of nations they were or what then-
partners would be like. # #
So the simple and obvious thing has been
done by making it a League of Platitudes.
The scheme is composed of the things that
go without saying, the circumstances that
exist in any case, and the matters that have
frequently happened already. 1\ ilson’s
League is to start without any army, navy
or police force of its own. Furthermore,
there is no real central authority yet, and
no one knows what it will be like. It is
mentioned vaguely as a “Council” —not as a
Ministry or Cabinet. In any case, the
League authority would have no place to
put an army or navy or police force if it had
one. It has no port and capital, no territory
or abode of its own, like the Federal District
of Columbia in the U.S., or Canberra in
Australia, or the principality of Meath,
which used to be the appanage of the elected
High Kings of Ireland. The new Govern-
ment, if it can be called one, will have lodg-
ings at Geneva, in a country where most of
the people speak German and have German
sympathies, just as its deceased predecessor
had apartments at the Hague.
One great purpose of the League is the
reduction of armaments, but as it couldn’t
be decided in the time available how to re-
duce armaments the matter has been com-
promised. The Council will make sugges-
tions, but each member will decide for itself.
There is to be a promise, however, that the
armaments, once fixed, will not be increased ;
if a member states its army on paper at
two billion troops and its navy at 1000
Dreadnoughts so as to leave plenty of mar-
gin, there must be no excess. If excess takes
place, the Council will rise up in its lodg-
ings and adopt such measures as a lodger
with neither men nor money may do. Its
strength will lie in its power to request its
members to take action, and they may act
or not as tliey think best. If they
do act they will supply such forces as
they think best. Any member in good
standing may quit on giving two years’
notice, unless he goes sooner. If he is so
much peeved as to want to quit he will pro-
bably make war at a minute’s notice. A
member who proves objectionable may be
expelled if anyone is big enough to push him
out, just as everybody has a right to push
an elephant out of his drawing-room. But
the' offender, unless he is in drink, will pro-
bably go willingly. He isn’t assured of any
special commercial advantages by remaining
in, or of any special defence advantages
except that the League will express dis-
approval if he is wronged; and he will have
more freedom of action outside. The League
is intended to put an end to all combines of
nations except its own. At the same time,
the Monroe doctrine, which is a sort of
compulsory defensive American league
headed by the United States, is recognised.
Also, there is talk of Japan setting up a sort
of Monroe arrangement in Asia. And there
are rumors of an “understanding” of Britain,
the United States and France for the protec-
tion of the last-named if its decimated
people should be again rushed by the Hun
and the League should be too slow and un-
wieldy to help. Also, mention is made of a
possible Pan-Latin combine, or brother-
hood or re-insurance company—presumably
France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and possibly
the South American republics—on the prin-
ciple that blood is thicker than water,
and that the brothers don’t wholly trust
Slav, Teuton or Mongol, none of whom trust
each other any more than the Latin trusts
them.
# * * *
The new institution has, apparently, three
possibilities ahead of it. In the first place it
may grow. Some altruistic State, or some
mercenary State with no beastly pride about
it and possessing much land and a sea-coast,
may sell itself and its debts to the League,
so that institution may have a home and a
postal address. That State would be blot-
ted out from among the nations, but it would
make much money out of the hotel business.
Or the League may steal a State. Which-
ever continent the capital of the world is in,
the other continents will probably feel wild.
Then the League may acquire taxing powers
of its own, which will mean three income-
taxes in Australia, and a cosmopolitan army
and navy of its own; also a real Federal
Government, Parliament and President. It
would then be strong enough to disarm the
States and be the sole peace-keeper, and.
next, it might begin to make a uniform tariff
and uniform immigration laws. That is
the progressive possibility. In the second
place the League may remain stationary—a
mere conference of pious remonstrance like
the Church, and the case of the Church shows
that an organisation of pious remonstrance
may live a long time. Or it may die out
like Australia’s old Federal Council, which
was exactly the same kind of powerless,
homeless, well-meaning body, through the
members forgetting to attend, or being un-
able to take themselves. seriously when they
got together. The Federal Council of Aus-
tralia lasted 13 years and held eight sessions.
One State was absent eight times. Another
was absent seven times. The rest were
absent-minded all the time. A day came
when the landlady noticed that the inter-
mittent lodger hadn’t turned up, and that
was the finish.
AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE.
There is a strong and growing public senti-
ment in favor of inducing returned officers
and N.C.O.’s with distinguished war records
to join the Citizen Forces wherever possible.
The desirability of retaining such men is
evident. They possess every quality requi-
site for the training of young soldiers and,
more particularly, young Australians. They
have the knowledge and the experience, and
also (an asset of profound importance where
a critical and high-spirited race is concerned)
the prestige which attaches to unchal-
lengeable courage. The Defence Depart-
ment has given consideration to this ques-
tion, and a few days ago it published the
following memo
It is impossible to grant commissions in the Citi-
zen Forces to returned members of the A.1.E.F., as
to do so would violate that portion of the Defence
Act which states that all promotion in the Citizen
Military Forces to the rank of officer and non-com-
missioned officer shall be from those who have
served in the ranks of Citizen Military Forces, and
the appointments and promotions shall be allotted to
those in the next lower grade who are most success-
ful in competitive examination.
The Department has known this ever since
the war began. So has everybody else.
And the Department, which is another way
of saying the Government, could have altered,
and can at any time alter, the position by a
simple amendment of the Act. It has not
done so, and it will not until it is forced to,
because its every move is performed at the
dictation of interested parties.
* * * *
There are hundreds of these officials in
the higher military positions, and, naturally,
they have no desire to be ousted from them.
They are out of sympathy with the A.I.F.
Most of them did not go to the present war—
in a few cases because they did not wish to,
more often because, for reasons of age or ill-
health, they were not allowed to. Others
went and saw no service. They were given
Base jobs at Le Havre, Etaples, Rouen, etc.,
or positions in training-camps in England,
and, being adjudged presently incompetent to
hold even them, were shipped back to Aus-
tralia. While these superannuated failures
muddle along doing their futile bit, day by
day, to make a laughing-stock of the C.M.F.,
the only men in the world capable of render-
ing the institution impressive (and propor-
tionately effective) are being hurriedly
drafted into civilian life. There is nothing
to be said against our Citizen Army
monopolists—except that they are unfitted
for their billets. They have worked well
according to their lights and opportunities,
and anything that the country can do for
them in the way of decorations, grants in
aid or what not would be generally approved.
Many of them deserve generous pensions.
If it were not for our in the long run waste-
ful no-pension system, a big class of sexa-
genarians, or thereabouts, would long since
have retired and made way for young and
up-to-date soldiers. The one fact which
stands out is that all these persons who are
soldiers in name only should be got rid of.
#• * * *
A strange argument which is common in
Departmental circles postulates that not only
is the present war over to all intents and pur-
poses, but that all wars are at an end owing
to the world’s acceptance of the League of
Nations principle. Trained fighting-men
are, accordingly, not required. The C.M.F.
of the future will be a mere national police
force. Why in the circumstances trouble to
disturb existing arrangements? This is a vari-
ant of the insane optimism which nearly lost
Britain the war. There was no aggression
about Germany, according to the pre-Arma-
geddon pacifists ; no need for compulsory mili-
tary service; no need even for a stronger
navy. There would never be another war:
Norman Angele had proved it. Australia
no more wants war in the future than
Britain did in 1914. But to shut its eyes
to facts would amount to insanity. There
is ample material for trouble. One of
the few useful acts done by the Russian Bol-
shevik Government was to make public the
text of the secret treaty concluded in 191(5
between the Imperial party in Russia and
the Japanese. The public treaty merely
disclosed a general aspiration on the
part of the two Governments to work
harmoniously together in “the East.”
The private one showed a set agree-
ment to take joint military action, as
both the London Times and the Manchester
Guardian summarised it, “against any third
Power which interfered in the affairs of
China.” _ In other words, the Anglo-Japan-
ese Alliance is founded on something
considerably less stable than a rock. Which
is only another way of saying that if
Australia is to be permanently safe
from the horrors of war, and from
the worse horrors of an unsuccessful
war, it must have an army, and an effici-
ent one. A first essential is to eliminate
everywhere, as soon as possible, officers and
N.C.O.’s who have had no practical experi-
ence of modern warfare in the only place that
counts the field—filling their places with
the best material available from the A.I.F.
Every day and week and month which
passes with the Defence Act left un-
amended to admit of this reform, means a
loss of personnel which might cost the coun-
try, ultimately, its national life.
THE STATELY HODGE OF ENGLAND.
-V conference of agricultural workers in
London it was decided to demand a minimum of
*2 10s. for a 44-hour week, and a half-holiday
weekly, with double pay for Sundays, and an old-age
pension of £1 a week.I’—Cable. 1 ’ — Cable.
Many years ago England adopted an insane
policy of wiping out the small independent
farmer or yeoman, and making him either a
tenant with a landlord to look after him
and charge heavily for looking, or a paid
laborer with both the tenant and the tenant’s
boss to sit like heavy fathers on his chest.
The confiscation of the common lands, which
was largely accomplished in Victoria’s time,
and their presentation to the nearest squire,
helped on the process. Then the Freetrade
party, decided that t!>s loaf, despite the fact
that it had a heavy landlord to carry, must
be so cheap that it could compete with the
imported loaf of all peoples, though some of
them had no landlord to carry and lived
where clothes were almost superfluous. So
the British agricultural toiler settled down
to be the worst-paid, most ignorant, most
hopeless, most servile and most rheumatic
person in the community. It was a matter
of course and a dispensation of Providence
that he should be so. The thing was sup-
posed to be beyond argument—like Free-
trade and the rights of the landlord. He
was named Hodge when he wasn’t called
Giles. He lived in a thatched cottage and
ate bacon-rind. In the drama he was de-
scribed collectively as “the villagers.” Bits
of verse like “Little Jim” and “A Village
Peasant” and “The Cotter’s Saturday
Night” wei'e written about him. It was
understood that he was a model of humble
virtue and would go to Heaven if he lived
long enough. His hours were 66 or 64 per
week, according to whether he knocked off
at four or six on Saturday, and, not so long
ago, his wages in money were 12s. or there-
abouts. Even when trades-unionism was
growing, strong stalwart unionists looked on
the idea of organising Hodge and Giles as
hopeless. The prevailing theory was that
there wasn’t enough to go round, so a large
class must be reluctantly enslaved and re-
duced to the crust and bacon-rind life to
give the rest a chance.
The Freetrade doctrine lived on the cult
of the Cheap Loaf, which was a good elec-
tion cry, though no one ever defined it. A
loaf is cheap at Is. if other things of the
same value are on an eighteen-penny basis,
and an ox is dear at Is. if other things with
similar qualities are on a ninepenny basis.
What was really meant was that the loaf
must be produced by cheap people in Britain,
or else it would be bought from cheap people
abroad and the British people be left un-
employed. The poverty of Hodge was the
only proof that it was cheap; its natural
price might be 2s. (id., with wages to cor-
respond. And as the soil, in addition to
carrying the landlord, had to carry local tax-
burdens such as charity rates, police rates
and education rates, which are unknown in
Australia, and which were equal to a second
landlord, Hodge had to be a very economi-
cal person. If he showed the slightest sign
of rising, an influx of cheap wheat grown by
people with fewer burdens reduced the
price of the loaf and shoved him down
again.
* * * »
Now that he has realised the absurdity of
the position there is no definite reason why
the llodge of England, who has much better
natural chances than the O’llodge of Ireland,
should not earn a minimum of £2 10s. per
week, or even more. He works on a fertile
soil. Though the United Kingdom is very
much less than half the size of N. S. Wales it
has nearly as much land under cultivation as
all Australia. So its wheat land isn’t very
specially selected soil as in this country, but
almost any old kind of soil. Yet it pro-
duces in an average year about 2J times
as much per acre as the Commonwealth’s
wheat area does. On that basis alone it
seems that, other things, such as the land-
lord, being made equal, the agricultural
laborer of J. Bull’s country might expect to
earn 24 times as much as his brother in Aus-
tralia, or to live by working less than half
Australian hours. In addition, he has a
market close at hand, for England, which is
the great wheat-producer of the Three-Kidg-
dom partnership, is dotted all over with big
manufacturing towns. If isn’t a One Big
City or One Big Port place. Between the
wheat-grower and the consumer there is sel-
dom more than 50 miles of railway haulage
to be paid for, as compared with an average
of something like 200 miles in Australia.
And none of the crop has to be sold abroad,
so that one-fourth or a half of it is absorbed
by foreign shipowners in payment for the
shifting of the remainder. In other words,
Britain hasn’t too many people at the wheat
business —rather it has too few ; and it has
escaped the crazy idea of Australian Free-
traders that all people should go on the land
and there should be no one but themselves
at hand to buy their produce, so that they
must live by swapping gooseberries with each
other.
Certainly the stately Hodge of England
has some distance to go before he can be
assured of a minimum wage of 50s. or more
per week. There must be a considerable
sacrifice of the great landlords, many of
whom have been accustomed for ages to take
half the crop for looking on as it grows.
The Big Landlord is in England the same
sort of locust that Needless Haulage is in
Australia. Britain has one peer to every
150 square miles, and most of them are land-
owners. Also it has about 1100 baronets,
and untitled squires beyond counting. In
England and Scotland the amount of soil
which hasn’t to support a hereditary para-
site as well as a worker is very small. Lately,
owing to war necessities, the State has
begun to seize on a huge proportion of the
hereditary parasite’s income. The idea now
is that, the landlord having become accus-
tomed to new circumstances, it should take
a big proportion of his land instead, which
would be much the same to him save for
loss of dignity, and would give the small
holder some sort of permanency. Then,
before Hodge can get the rise of wages he
aims at, it might be necessary to relieve the
land of some of its bulky imposts—to throw
Cobden overboard and make the Customs a
bigger source of revenue. It would be
essential also to put the importation of grain
under State control lest the Cheap Loaf
should ruin the new order of things after
all. And in any case the Hodge of Eng-
land can’t hope to be surreptitiously pam-
pered out of the Treasury like his Australian
brother by having his produce carried at
half cost on railways built out of (largely-
foreign) loans which no one seriously pro-
poses to repay, though they are renewed
often enough. Yet, in spite of these things,
a new era seems to be dawning for the
peasant whom poets loved to call a “swain”
—the dutiful son who lived in a thatched
cottage, and the ploughman who homeward
plodded his weary way. and the cotter who
had that oft-recited Saturday night, and the
other rude forefathers of the hamlet.
CHINA DURING THE WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The war-record of our most multitudinous
Ally is not a bright one. When in 1917 the
Chinese Government declared war on Ger-
many, the leader-writers hailed the event
with fervent enthusiasm. The military
experts calculated China’s possible contribu-
tion to the Allied arms. Her resources in
iron, coal and minerals essential for muni-
tion-making were inexhaustible, her laboi
reserves enormous. On the usual lyP-c-
-basis she could mobilise 40 million soldiei*.
This incredible army was pictured as advanc-
ing, like its ancestors, the Hiung -NU,
through Siberia and Russia and falling on
our enemies like a tawny avalanche,
did not worry the experts as to how
hungry hordes were to be got rid of once tne_
had established themselves in Europe anu,
like former mercenaries, had found it tan.
To turn from expectation to realisation
is a sorry business. The 40 million soldiers


did not materialise, though a useful band of
coolie laborers was sent to France and did
good work there. The Chinese Government
occupied and policed Harbin after the Rus-
sian collapse and sent troops to Manchuria,
where they fraternised with the Bolsheviks
until the victories of the Czecho-Slovaks
altered the complexion of things. A Chinese
army co-operated with the Japanese, but,
being jealous of alien interference, opposed
a single command, and was in consequence a
serious danger to Allied operations. Event-
ually a considerable number of Chinese
troops appear to have got into Russia, where
they are alleged to be acting as executioners
and Pretorian guard to the Bolsheviks.
Chinese industry was never put on a war
footing, and, though there was increased
shipbuilding in the foreign settlements,
China’s vast resources of iron and coal were
left virtually untapped.
But while China slumbered the crowded
little islands across the Yellow Sea worked
overtime. Japan’s war effort was immense.
While China sprouted rebel generals and
dissenting Parliamentarians, Japan grew
nariken —war millionaires—and planted fresh
forests of factory chimneys. In 1894 only
84 steamers were owned in Japan, and of
these only one had been built there. The
year before the war the total output of
Japanese yards was G 3,064 tons; in 1918
over 1,330,000 tons were under construction,
all with State subsidy. To-day Japan
ranks third among the nations in tonnage
built, and fifth in tonnage owned.
While. China raised large armies for an
internecine warfare which devastated the
country and saddled her with an immense
war debt, Japan, with only a small expedi-
tionary force and her navy to maintain, was
able to convert her foreign debt into a huge
credit balance. At the same time her sur-
plus energy was devoted to a vigorous foreign
policy. The regimentation of China, her
development under Japanese direction into a
well-organised but subordinate Ally, has been
the long dream of Japanese Chauvinists,
and a perpetual nightmare to such great
Chinese patriots as Liang Chi-Chiao. In
1915, when the Western nations were locked
in a life-and-death struggle whose issue was
in frightful doubt, Japan launched at her
large and somnolent neighbor the famous
21 demands. In Shantung Japan was
to be given absolutely unlimited power to
make any agreement with Germany arising
out of the Tsingtao occupation which she
thought fit. Her special position in South
Manchuria and Inner Mongolia was to be
recognised, and privileges of land ownership,
policing and freedom of movement granted
to no other nation were demanded. China
was to. bind herself not to cede or lease to
any third Power any harbor, bay or island
along the coast of China. But the demand
which filled the atmosphere of the Flowery
Kingdom with a cloud of sundered pigtails
was the notorious Group V., afterwards drop-
ped. with a reservation that Japan would
revive it when she thought fit, which gave to
the. active little people over the Huang Hai
unlimited rights of providing China with
political, financial and military advisers, of
founding institutions, of purchasing land in
the interior, of lending her money and of re-
converting her to the religion which she
originally gave to Japan and which she her-
self has never relinquished. Negotiations
continued from February 2 till May
7, when, no finality having been reached,
Japan delivered an ultimatum. China
burst into a storm of indignation and
expostulation, and some slight modifica-
tions were allowed. Yet 400 million
exasperated but unorganised patriots are
no match for a handful of resolute statesmen,
backed by an efficient nation of 50 millions;
and China bowed to the inevitable. Liang
Chi-Chiao consoled his fellow-countrymen
by pointing out in a series of brilliant articles
that, although for the present Japan might
subjugate China, China in the end must in-
evitably by sheer inertia conquer her con-
queror as she had always done before.
Which is true if you forget the present gen-
eration and think in terms of centuries or
epochs.
Armed with China’s acquiescence to the 21
demands, Japan was expected to go ahead
with the reorganisation of the country. But
China’s dough is not yet Japan’s pudding.
The first problem was to re-establish a
strong Government in China, where each
province and each general had become law-
breakers unto themselves. Japan therefore
heavily backed Yuan Siiih-Kai, and the
deluded man reached out for the vacant pea-
cock throne. But to his own and Japan’s
surprise, Republican sentiment rose up and
smote him from his eminence. In his fall he
brought down the whole fabric of govern-
ment. Meanwhile Japan had obtained
concessions of iron-mines in Iviangsu. fish-
eries in the Gulf of Pechili, oilfields in
Shensi, and monopolies for the supply of
arms, railway material, rice and ships; buf
owing to the general disorganisation she has
been able to derive little advantage out
of them as yet. The cessation of hostilities
in Europe created a new situation. The
flow of money and munitions into China
ceased, the generals could not pay their
armies, and the armies were tired of fighting.
The country was indifferent to the merits of
the political dispute on constitutional details
between the Northern Parliament and the
Revolutionary Parliament sitting in Canton,
and a compromise was achieved by the re-
tirement of President Feng Kuo-Chang and
the election of Hsu Shih-Chang. A Peace
Conference was lately sitting in Shanghai
which, while it may reconcile the differences
of the contending parties, is not likely to
attack the root disease, the inordinate power
of the military party. Hsu Shih-Ciiang,
a courtly old gentleman and a sort of Celes-
tial Asquith, who was expected to be pleas-
ing to all parties, has unexpectedly developed
claws, and in one or two resolute measures
has already curtailed the influence of the
military gang and enhanced civilian prestige
The fate of the 21 demands remains in
abeyance. The Chinese ambassadors are
certain to make every effort in Paris to have
them repealed, and Japan will be hard put to
find arguments to justify them. Besides,
Japanese foreign policy is not now as certain
in its aim as it was. It is more and more the
sport of political parties at home. The
Chinese people, always keenly jealous of their
right to muddle through to their destiny in
their own way, will put every obstacle in
the way of the Japanese drill-sergeant!
The Japanese* dream of a Nipponised
China will, one feels, never be realised.
China’s regeneration will come from herself.
She lacks none of the eight signs of eventual
Buddhahood. Even in the dismal record of
1918 there are seen the elements of great-
ness. In the midst of extraordinary poli-
tical turmoil a model prison was erected at
Anking and a modern hospital at Peking, and.
an outbreak of pneumonic plague, instead of
being allowed to run its course as hitherto,
was successfully extinguished by the efforts
of Dr. Wu Lien-teH, head of the Plague
Prevention Bureau. To those who have
seen the inside of an old-style Chinese prison
or have experienced the official attitude to-
wards sanitation and hygiene, these things
speak volumes. The barometer of Chinese
trade steadily mounts, despite every adverse
circumstance. And President Hsu Shih-
Ciiang inaugurated the New Year with as
startling and picturesque a piece of quixot-
ism as lies to the credit of any Government.
He bought the 24 million dollars’ worth of
foreign opium which had been lodged at
Shanghai ever since China closed her doors
to the trade, and, despite the protests of
Chinese syndicates anxious to debauch their
fellow-countrymen, deliberately burnt it!
The history of China’s heroic effort to throw
off the fatal drug-habit has had its vicissi-
tudes. Owing to the breakdown of govern-
ment, the poppy has begun to rear its head
again in the provinces, and there is an
enormous illicit traffic in hypodermic syringes
and morphia through Tsingtao. But there
is growing public opinion behind the Gov-
ernment, and the costly bonfire in Shanghai
is a symbol of its sincerity and of the Chinese
will to regenerate.
FENG-SUI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Loser Pays.
Forty-nine years ago Leboeuf, France’s
then Minister for War, who was a braggart
as well as a fool, said : “The Army is ready
jusqu’ au dernier bouton de guetre .” Not
only were the army’s buttons not ready; it
was unprepared even in the matters of its
boots and its food-supply. France went
under, beaten as much by its leaders and
their criminal neglect to prepare for the
Day that had been so obviously coming ever
since 1857 as by the hosts of Germany. A
period of unspeakable humiliation began.
From being the proudest military nation in
the world the French had to become one of
the humblest. Hamerton remarked at the
time that, after talking during the course of
their national existence of “Glory,” they had
nothing to fall back on but the hope of
“Revenge.” They had to edit their anthems
and amend their proverbs. An indemnity was
required of them which was considered at the
time so vast as to be unpayable. They could
have blubbered of their misfortunes and
of their poverty, or they could have threat-
ened the world with a revival of the Bol-
shevism with which they had horrified it
three-quarters of a century before. What they
did was to take their licking in silence like
the gallant fighting-men they are, and to pay
with record speed the debt which they had
incurred. The Germans stand to-day where
the French stood in 1871, insofar as they
are the losers and hence are called on to
foot the bill. In other respects their posi-
tion is different. No Frenchman ever
bragged so blatantly as the Hun leaders did
during the first four years of the war. And,
the war being lost, no Frenchman howled
with such a degraded abandon of lugubrious-
ness as the Germans are doing. The pen-
alty is certainly severe. Over four-fifths of
the civilised world the German is looked on
as a social leper. Deutschland is no longer
“over all,” and the watch on the Rhine is
being kept by the Fatherland’s enemies. It
is possible that by persevering shamelessly
in the policy of the Asiatic beggar who
howls on the doorsteps and refuses to be
dislodged, the nation may escape a portion
of its indebtedness. But it will still have
a huge sum to pay. Poverty and the world’s
hatred or pitying contempt as the case may
be—they are invariably the loser’s end of
the purse in warfare. France was called
on to walk its Calvary because it was un-
piepared on land. One of the chief causes
of Germany’s ruin was that it fought before
it was strong enough at sea. There are
useful lessons to be gained from both cases
hi Austialia. One is the ghastly error of
national unreadiness, whether militarily
navally or financially. The other is the wel'l-
m£. ln t°l e . ra bl e plight of a modern nation
which havmg decided or having been forced
to fight, is defeated.
The Penny-dreadful Voter.
Phe "V ictorian State Labor Conference in
preparing its programme for the all-Aus-
tralian Conference which builds a pro-
gramme for the party in general, decided in
tavor of making every male and female of 18
an elector. That would increase the number
of electors by about one-fifteenth, which is
quite sufficient to start the whole policy of
the continent on a new track and divert it
into the pursuit of new gods. The new elec-
tors would be fresh from school; filled, or
partly tilled, with the information contained
in the school-reader, and mostly untravelled.
A vast proportion of them would have seen
nothing beyond their own town or township.
“ u ® me ® s they would be just a little beyond
the office-boy stage. In trades they wouldn’t
be beyond the apprentice stage. In general
“t er ature they would be between the penny-
dreadful and _ the penny-paper stage. As
regards experience of the world they would
have hardly any, except in the case of those
unfortunates who were driven at an early
age to scrape up a living by selling the even-
ing rag, and their knowledge would be pecu-
liar. Being, except in a very few instances,
untrammelled by wives, children or the cares
of business, they would be expected to bring
a . cheerful, experimental, devil-may-care
spirit into public affairs. The idea of mak-
ing the kid of 18 a sovereign elector origi-
nated with the “advanced” or Bolshevik or
debt-repudiation section of the Labor party,
which evidently thinks that its views and
assertions will appeal to an ignorant and
immature class. In fact, it relies on the
penny-dreadful vote as its vote. If the boy
elector once gets into politics he won’t be
put out provided his own very massive-vote
can keep him in. Indeed, if there is any
chance of his being put out he may get to
work and secure the enfranchisement of the
kid of 10, and then the solid vote of recently-
spanked youth will be practically unshift-
able. If in the joy of life he strengthened his
position by procuring the enfranchisement of
the kid of 15, then their 800.000 votes might
make a patriarch of 10 Prime Minister.
Republics have a habit of fixing the min-
imum age of the President at 30 or 35, and
some have a minimum age of 25 for members
and an education test for voters. The
democratic kingdom of Norway fixes 25 as
the voting age, and if Australia sets it below
21 it will have the credit of putting up a
world’s record.
-♦
The Tangle of the Law.
A country lawyer tries to take a dispas-
sionate view of his profession:—
To expect lawyers to clean up the Augean stable
of the Law is absurd. Their education, from when
first they hear the syren-like song of Costs, has been
to hedge the simplest transaction with a host of
technicalities. The common-law conveyance—with
its endless repetitions about heirs, executors, admini-
strators and assigns—is ridiculously archaic to all
but these hidebound dealers in sheepskin and sealing-
wax.
In conveyancing, the estates and tenures of the
Feudal system (a.d. 1099) are solemnly taught the
sucking lawyer, and so long as lawyers are permitted
to draft Acts of Parliament so long will technicali-
ties accumulate. Look at the N. S. Wales Crown
Lands Act. Here was virgin soil; yet the lawyer-
draftsmen constructed a clumsy and intricate
measure providing for dozens of different tenures
and, incidentally, work for an army of Land Courts,
Land Boards, Land Agents, surveyors, solicitors,
barristers and C.P. inspectors. It took a surveyor
(Torrens of S. Aus.) to evolve the R.P. system of
titles, which indicates the first thing to be done,
viz., to strike at the root of the evil and debar law-
yers from drafting Acts of Parliament. Appoint,
instead, as a drafting committee, a professor of
English and an expert in the matter to be dealt
with. The latter could supply the technical details,
the former express them in simple and grammatical
language. At present a more ungrammatical horror
than an Act of Parliament is hard to find.
A simple way of reform in conveyancing lies to
hand. It should be made compulsory for all com-
mon-law titles to be brought under the Real Pro-
perty Act within a fixed period. Divide the titles
into two classes, one comprising those under £lO,OOO
in value, the other all above that. To the former
issue R.P. titles on 10 years’ undisturbed possession
being shown, thus avoiding the existing cumbrous
procedure. As a safeguard against injustice, provide
for a 5 per cent, assurance fee instead of the present
fund. With regard to titles over £lO,OOO in value,
they are comparatively so few that the present proce-
dure might be followed. By such means the convey-
ancing stall of the stable could be cleaned in a
short time.
As to the courts, the system of dealing out law in
one set of courts and equity in another, thereby
admitting law and equity are not synonymous, is a
cynical confession of the state of affairs; but its
ridiculousness does not appear to strike the Devil’s
Brigade. Something slight has been attempted in
the N.S.W. Commercial Causes Act, but it is seldom
availed of by solicitors, who prefer to peg along in
the old rut. They must be torn from their gods;
they won’t give them up. The District Court is
fairly modern, and, with little alteration, could be
made to fit every set of circumstances. Adopt that
Act as a base; fuse the jurisdictions of law and
equity; allow District Courts to deal with cases of
every description—common law, equity, probate and
divorce —in the same way as it now deals with cases
within its present jurisdiction, and the reform is
accomplished. The way is so simple and easy as to
make its adoption absolutely hopeless.
When Judges Fly.
Judge Murray, of Papua, who is also Lieut.-
Governor, presents a report which tends to
show that Australia’s tropical possession has
got past being a land of promise and become
a land of performance. Every year the
revenue grows a little larger and the deficit
a good deal smaller. The shortage was
£37,000 in 1913 and only £20,000 in 1917.
Now the time is at hand when there will be
a surplus for public works, which Australia,
the land of loans, never seems to have. The
aborigines are said to be developing wonder-
fully and becoming capable artisans, and
other good things are happening. But Judge
Murray reckons that Papua will never be a
white man’s country in the sense that it
will have a resident white population that
has come to stay. And there The Bulle-
tin reckons that the Lieut.-Excellency is
probably wrong, he being doubtless a good
judge but very likely a poor air navigator.
It isn’t expected that there will ever be a
very large permanent white population in
the Possession, for the brown man fills a lot
of space, but no reason appears why there
shouldn’t be a considerable one. There is
new hope and a new life and a new prospect
for the hottest country if it has a high, cool
interior, and Papua has a good deal of tall
interior. Hitherto the white man’s curse
has been that there is always a belt of low,
unhealthy land along the coast, that the ports
are on the coast, and that the white man’s
mercantile business makes him congregate
there. In these surroundings he dies too
fast and consequently becomes dispirited; for
nothing is more depressed than a corpse.
And even if he takes to the hills he has to
cross the unwholesome land to get there, col-
lecting germs as he goes. This heated strip,
which is often very narrow, is the ill-luck of
Mexico, Central America, Burmah, the North-
ern Territory, part of North Queensland and
Papua. Perspiring globe-trotters judge and
report on the whole State by it. So, very
often, do the bulk of the inhabitants, who
live in the worst part of the country by
commercial necessity. When man simply
flies over the heated strip on his way to
his port on the tableland, the ideas of a
million years as to what constitutes a white
man’s country will be reversed. Then Lieut.-
Governor Mubkay, converted into a Flying
Judge, will have to write a revised report.
If he flies too high over Fort Moresby on
his way to his new capital he may say, in
haste and error and frostbite, that Papua
was really meant for Eskimo, and that he
wonders why Polar bears are not more
plentiful.
Two Pictures.
A lot of persons have been writing to the
papers lately in this strain (sample letter in
S. M. llebald) :
I am a married man with one child. I am a
laborer receiving £3 6s. per week Lite to me is
a continual grind, with always the fear of the future.
The average worker has no resources beyond the wage
he can earn by the sale of his labor Apart from
pictures once a week and an outing on Sundays now
and then, we have no luxuries.... A three weeks’
sickness and we are thrown back three months.... I
am a mere cog, and with the roar of the machinery
at times it is maddening.... The workers are brutal-
ised and degraded by the continual grind and the
fear of unemployment. How, then, can they be
blamed if they turn to sabotage, Bolshevism, etc.?
It is pathetic enough, and here is the other
picture as it might be drawn:
I am a farmer working 250 acres of wheat land,
which is the extreme limit for a single-handed worker
doing fairly long hours and at times seven days a
week. 1 have to get the use of £l5OO or £lBOO
worth of land and improvements, and at least £5OO
worth of perishable horses and implements to have a
chance to do these long hours, and the money costs
7+ per cent. Of course, if you can find £llOO or
£l2OO yourself and only require to borrow a com-
parative trifle the money is cheaper.
A crop of 12 bushels per acre brings in about
£520 at very ordinary rates. (You can’t crop the
place your house_ and outbuildings stand on, or the
road leading to the house, or the dam, so some land
is wasted.) About £35 goes in seed. Bags cost
£5O. Insurance is £lO or £2O. (The city worker
doesn’t need to insure the product of his labor ; the
boss does that.) About £5O goes in repairing and
replacing worn-out machines and replacing dead
horses. (The city worker’s boss looks after the
machines and horses.) Horses have to be fed as well
as myself and family. Medical charges (family and
horses) are higher than in the city, because the
doctor doesn’t live at the next corner. The price of
a baby is amazing. The interest eats up £lso' or
£l6O, or more. There is something for fertiliser,
and there are sundries.
I pan out at about £3 10s. a week except in very
bad years. Of course, I pay no rent, but the house
wouldn’t fetch much rent in the city, there being no
water or gas in it.
I don’t go to the picture-show so often as once a
week, for it is too far off. A three weeks’ sickness
throws me back, and three weeks’ sickness among
the horses throws me further back. (The city
laborer never sits up all night nursing a sick imple-
ment, and it doesn’t matter to him if his boss’s
horse, which he drives, is thrown back into the next
parish and breaks its neck.) I am paid once a year,
and unless I am ahead of the game I must find
credit till next pay-day. My great fear is not loss of
employment. I get more employment than any city
laborer dreams of. My fear is lest the year’s wages
may not be paid. It all depends on the drought.
How often does a city laborer have a year’s wages
owing to him with no certainty of payment?
I don’t have an occasional outing on a fine Sun-
day. I have an outing every day even if it rains
like Sheol.
I have no temptation to sabotage, for the only
machines I can break are my own—-at least, I owe
for them. 1 spppose I am brutalised, but I never
had time to think much about it. Of course, I have
the dignity of being an employer—l employ myself
and an occasional swagman. I am a master, in fact.
Also, I am a capitalist with somebody else’s capital.
I don’t rank as a laborer, because I have learned a
trade. If I was an ambitionless person content to be
a laborer and a mere “cog” people would call me a
swagman.
These are the two pictures. One represents
the brute-force toiler who is numerous partly
because there are few chances in this im-
porting country to learn highly-skilled indus-
try the man whose life is one long struggle
to earn enough by doing ass’s toil to pay
the foreign profiteers who sell him almost
everything he uses at steadily rising prices.
The other represents the man who has to
look for a great part of his market at the
other end of the world because there are so
few skilled, well-paid artisans here to be his
customers, and who gives the shipping and
agency people one-fourth of liis export crop
to pay them for selling the other three-
fourths. Frankly, this paper wouldn’t care
to be either of them.
Tasmania’s Political Shindy.
The Speck’s politics promise more than
ordinary interest during the next month or
two. and the interest will not be altogether
ir o, *! ie IS,; Pl ace > the elections on
May 01, being the first post-war political
scrimmage in Australasia, will be expected
to serve as an indicator, or a criterion or a
warning or something, as to what may hap-
pen in other States; and, in the second
place, a new set of party tactics is being
given a trial spin. Hitherto his Majesty’s
Opposition has been content to function as
a critic of the Government’s proposals, but
on the present occasion Labor-leader Lyons
has upset the established rules by taking the
initiative. At Deloraine on April 16 lie
announced the policy of his party, anticipat-
ing Premier Lee’s story by a week and caus-
ing consternation among Ministerialists, who
found themselves compelled to hurriedly re-
draft their speeches on defensive lines. It
remains to be seen whether Lyons’s bold
move will enable him to smash through, or
whether the Lee crowd possesses sufficient
punch or generalship to turn the attack and
re-assume. the lead. Indications are certainly
not wanting that the Labor party’s sudden
rush has set the Nationalists under Lee
thinking furiously. The Labor-leader’s
contains nothing to gladden the heart
or Torydom. Indeed, it reads like a declara-
•jji com f° r profiteers, land-monopolists,
middlemen, parasites and political oppor-
tunists. Also, it cuts the ground from under
tlie hoofs of the party which hoped to make
.I °i vn w **-h. Bolshevism!” the battlecry at
the forthcoming polls; for Lyons denounces
Bolshevism as unnecessary and un-Aus-
tralian. The State’s most promising public
service—the Hydro-Electric-—which owes its
origin to the Labor Government of 1915, is
to. be improved and extended, side by side
with irrigation and closer-settlement; electri-
cal railways are to be run into the State’s
most productive areas; and the present stag-
nant policy in regard to public works is to
be reversed. Every pledge given to the
soldiers by the perfervid Nationalists is to
be faithfully carried out; forestry and min-
ing are to be encouraged, and the saw T railling
industry championed when the Common-
wealth Government is readjusting the tariff.

Cheap land for settlers in get-at-able locali-
ties is to be provided; co-operative soldier
settlements are forecasted ; the island’s shale
and iron deposits are to be operated by
the State; steamers are to be built or
bought for the inter-State and Straits
Islands trade; health is to be nationalised,
and the collection-box cadge on Hospital
Day is to vanish ; flour-mills, the export and
storage of perishable products, and intoxi-
cating liquor are all to be nationalised as
soon as may be. And even that is only part
of Labor’s tremendous programme. Wnere
is the money to come from V Not from loans
altogether, though Labor will accept Cohen’s
help at reasonable interest for undertakings
which look like paying a sufficient contribu-
tion to a sinking-fund to dissolve the debt in
20 or 30 years. For the necessary revenue
Lyons states plainly that wealth must pay
by (1) increased tax on incomes over £3OO,
(2) increased land tax on unimproved values
exceeding £IOOO, (3) increment tax on pro-
fits derived from the sale of land, (4) in-
crease in rates on incomes not derived from
personal exertion. And Lyons, who has had
some experience as Treasurer of the State,
declares that this programme can be carried
out without driving either money or men out
of the island.
The New Weapon of Peace.
“0.K.”: The one and only way to suppress
the ancient institution of legalised slaughter
is to make it unthinkable to great cities. In
the past bloodshed has been decreed by
persons who themselves were not going to
fight, and encouraged by irresponsible
jingoes and paunchy profiteers, who expected
to suffer nothing worse than dividends
from it. The recent innovation of aiv-raid-
ing made a difference in the popular concep-
tion of war, but the raiding didn’t go far
enough, or last long enough. The fact lias
not yet been widely grasped that, whereas
Germany made the war, and had been talk-
ing dreaming and scheming Konquest for
the past 40 years, the Rhine towns were
practically in revolt against militarism, as
the result of the air-raiding they had suf-
fered, before the Kaiser fled to Holland.
Yet the bombing of those Rhine towns was
a mere warning of what would have hap-
pened had the war lasted longer—a slight
suggestion of the horrors that will be pos-
sible when the art of aviation is more
developed. Now, the natural desire of
professional militarism is to nip this new
terror in the bud, as far as civilians are
concerned, by bringing about an inter-
national agreement to abstain from using
the new terror in wartime. If militarism
can over-rule commonsense, henceforth as in
the past, civilisation will be persuaded _ to
abstain from exercising the easy terrorism
whereby nations could be deterred from
resorting to force of arms. Does any think-
ing person suppose there ever would be any
more German Menace if the present Allies
contracted to collectively rain bombs on any
nation that broke the peace and laughed
arbitration to scorn? The true aim of
civilisation is not to have war conducted mi
humanitarian as compared with Hun prin-
ciples, but to restrain nations from war by
wholesome terrorism, ns individuals are re-
strained from crime by fear of punishment.

The Manufacturer and the
Storekeeper.
“Hiron” : I am a country storekeeper and
can speak with a fair knowledge of the
ways of our great importing houses to ‘‘out”
Australian industries. A few weeks ago I
required wire, and asked for quotations from
three warehouses. I also asked a Melbourne
wire co. to quote direct. Result: “Colonial”
No. 8 Black. £25. Imported wire varied
from £2 to £0 per ton dearer. The wire
co.’s quotation was £25, less discount —
exactly the same as the warehouse’s. Mean-
time a fairly large country ironmongery firm
sent its traveller around. He told every
farmer not to touch Colonial at any price,
stating that if they wanted any they could
buy any quantity at £l6 to £l7 per ton.
On hearing this I made inquiry, but could not
locate any, thus proving that a mis-statement
had been made. I determined, anyhow, to
try some Colonial and got a small lot, and
asked a client to take a coil out to try. He
strained this up and was so satisfied that he
ordered Colonial, although previously he had
a strong prejudice against it. Deciding to
buy I placed my order with the traveller for
the warehouse with which I usually do busi-
ness. I specified Colonial. He then stated
that he would send imported wire at the
same price, viz., £25, “as they did not want
to handle Colonial.” I made up my mind
in two seconds. Imported will show me 30s.
to £2 more profit per ton. I ordered im-
ported. and so gave another good Australian
industry a kick. The position from the store-
keeper’s point of view is this. If the Aus-
tralian manufacturer does not protect us in
the same manner as the wholesaler has done,
nearly all storekeepers will back the im-
porter. Any customer of mine can get Ams-
tralian wire at the price I can. His
freights on small quantities are very little
more. This will not allow us any margin
of profit. I want to help Australian industry
if I can, but I must live. If the Australian
manufacturer is a fool he will continue to
sell through the importer, who doesn’t want
the industry, and will kill trade if he can.
Alternatively, the manufacturer will organise
a central selling agency to deal direct with
the storekeeper. That to me seems wiser
than dealing direct with the consumer and
making it so hot that no storekeper can stock
his lines.
The position in Europe to-day is curiously
like it was in the closing stages of the Congress
of Vienna. The representatives of the vic-
torious nations, who had started their dis-
cussion in amity, concluded them in ill-con-
cealed hatred and contempt. Then, as now,
there were Nationalists and International-
ists. The latter were led by Alexander I.
The views he held (or rather expressed) a
century ago were, in their essence, the views
which are voiced by Wilson to-day. Just
as the delegates were on the point of recom-
mending their Governments to start a war
amongst themselves to stop all wars, the
news arrived that Napoleon had escaped.
The equivalent of Napoleon in Europe to-
day is Bolshevism. The difference is that
Napoleon after Elba was a prematurely-
aged menace, with cancer of the stomach,
while Bolshevism is young and hearty in
many parts of Europe and possessed of an
infectivity which has spread it as far afield
as Japan.
THE EASY WAY.
COAL-MINER: “Here, this fellow has got more than his share. If I don’t get some of it
I’ll stoush him.”
THE JUDGE: “Now, now, no quarrelling! There’s not much left for the public; but I'll
cut you each off another slice if you’ll be quiet.”
“0.K.” : The prosecution of a Melbourne
Dago cafe proprietor, for allowing oysters
to be opened and dipped in filthy water,
suggests once more the absurdity of our
national motto, “Australia for the Austra-
lians.” if restaurants, bun-shops and fruit
and fish shops are to remain in the hands of
Dagoes and Germans. As regards the fish,
fruit and bread trades in particular, Aus-
tralia is for foreigners in a large degree —
foi’eigners who, in the case of the swarthiest
of them, are dirty, insolent, contemptuous
and auite offensive to good Australian senti-
ment. The foreign “ring” is the result of
foreign conspiracy. All the anti-Austra-
lians in our midst are more or less banded
together for mutual support. Aliens import
aliens for trading purposes; hence the pre-
valence of broken English in the light-
refreshment shops. That the foreigners
should patronise one another may be natural
enough. But why does the native- and
British-born element do it, and do it to
such an extent that we are threatened with
a future when Australians of British origin
will be pushed right out from the fish and
fruit trades? It is not only that we are
losing the business. To any who take the
trouble to observe the signs of the times
it is apparent that our growing Dago popu-
lation is increasingly uncivil to sons of the
soil. Prosperity breeds arrogance among
the swarthy to a marked extent, and our
creed of Australia for the Australians sets
them grinning almost in our faces. The
same clannish tactics employed in capturing
certain trades that touch our stomachs
nearly will be employed in ousting easy-
going Australians from other trades pre-
sently if we leave alien influence unchecked.
We don’t need a tariff to secure for our-
selves these callings. W e only need a little
more patriotic thoughtfulness.
“Tariff”: I have just come from England,
where I saw the once-prosperous cabinet-
making business of my father dwindle almost
to bankruptcy under Freetrade. As soon as
German submarines made wholesale importa-
tions impossible, the business revived, and
practically all the woodwork for aircraft was>
home-made. To-day I called at a leading
business house in Sydney to purchase house-
hold crockery. I failed to obtain a single
article made in Australia. Some badly-
finished jugs were shown me with the re-
mark. “These are made in Melbourne, but
we never recommend our customers to buy
the things made here.” I don’t know
whether it is worse to kill established indus-
tries, as was done in England, or to choke the
baby before he can grow up, as you are doing
in Australia. Both are suicidal.
It takes 10 of some brands of Japanese
safety-matches to light a cigar, and the
flaming heads of the third, fifth and ninth
fly off and lodge in the smoker’s hair, and
the hot end of the second gets inside his
collar. There is a very small duty on
matches, fixed when the cost of living and
of raw materials was about half what it is
now. The Labor party shoved up wages
without any increase of duty till the worker
was getting the full product of his toil and
a little over ; so the local industry closed up
and there were no wages. Eyen then the
Labor leaders didn’t see the point, but con-
tented themselves with general remarks
about “profiteering.” Matches seem a small
thins:, but Australia lately sent away
£287.000 in one year for these imported
combustibles, which amount would have
furnished employment at £5 a week for 1100
heads of families. Meanwhile there is. a
small civil war at Fremantle (W.A.), with
stoppage of trade, because two sets of men
are fighting for the beast-of-burden job _of
unloading imported matches off foreign
ships.
Randolph Bedford writes :
A Queensland telegram that on Anzae Day, at Bris-
bane, E. G. Theodore was counted out, and that
there were shrieking fools who told him, a good
Australian, to “go back to his own country” (which
is Port Adelaide, if one must be meticulously local),
strengthens my belief that immigrants should not
have a vote until they have been five or six years
in the country, or sufficiently long to make Austra-
lians of them. It’s all politics, this blaring of
“loyalty” and “Empire,” and most “loyalty” and
“Empire” is anti-Australian. For instance, Theo-
dore, the Australian, is a “foreigner” ; Quilp Macart-
ney, the imported person, is a “patriot.” The fact
is that E. G. Theodore has committed three crimes—
he is an Australian, a Labor man and a Catholic.
The son of a Roumanian father (who became a good
Australian and democrat) and a Lancashire mother,
he is a miner of the best Australian sort, which is
the kind unbeatable. He did the thing usual to the
adventurous Australian, and was out on his
own at 13. He was in Broken Hill till he
was 18 or so, and while there he and a mate read
through a local library—good, bad, indifferent and
stupid—from A to the bitter end. Later he walked
the 500 miles or so from Beltana to Tarcoola; at
20 he went to N.Q., and was a miner on the Vulcan,
and at 24 he was elected member for Chillagoe.
And he belongs to a real Government —the -first
real Australian Government ever known in Australia.
April 22 was the anniversary of the open-
ing of the first S. Aus. Parliament under
Constitutional Government. October 24,
1850, the Constitution was proclaimed; in
March, 1857, the elections for the two
Houses took place; and the first sessions
began on April 22. B. T. Finniss was Pre-
mier, and Torrens—the man who invented
the Torrens title —was his Treasurer.
Eighteen members were elected to the Coun-
cil, the whole province voting as a single
electorate, and the term of office was 12
years; but there was a provision in the Con-
stitution that at the end of each period of
four years six members should retire. The
Assembly started with 3G members.
At tin* Peace Conference Clemenceau
speaks English to Woodrow Wilson and
then casts a few French asides to his
own colleagues to keep them in touch with
the discussion. Bonar Law and Balfour
have a good knowledge of French, and fre-
quently begin their speeches in that language
and wind up with the English transla-
tion. Sonino, the Italian Foreign Minister,
uses either French or English, and then per-
mits the interpreter to have the floor while
lie whispers an Italian translation to Orlando,
the Italian Premier. Lloyd George, Wilson
and Lansing, having little knowledge of
French, use only English, and rely on the
interpreter, unless the eager Clemenceau
hasn’t already passed on their views.
Minister Clarke, of Victoria, after a visit
to Sydney, said things about one of the local
repatriation enterprises which is probably
true, though no local Minister would dare
say it. Probably also there are things in
his own State which Clarke dare not men-
tion, though a visitor might. He alleged
that he found 57 ex-soldiers hen-raising on
700 acres —about 12£ acres each —and
though they had been banning for 38 months
not one was making a living. All were in
debt for improvements and sustenance ad-
vances —some of them £BOO or £lOOO in debt.
Of course, most of the cases are hopeless,
and people who know the ebook industry
recognised that from the start. The men
were set chooking so that the Ministry might
get credit for “settling” them (on credit).
It would have been much more profitable to
have employed them making matches that
will strike.
As a matter of fact, promotion from the
salt-water equivalent of the ranks is more
difficult in the allegedly-democratic Aus-
tralian Navy than in the British Navy.
Scores of instances could be given. X was
a young Australian gunnery instructor, and
fired the foremost turret on Sturdee’s flag-
ship when Von Spee was passed out. Later,
in the North Sea, candidates for urate were
interviewed by a selection committee on
board Jellicoe’s flaeship Iron Duke. The
candidates were weeded out until only four
remained. Three belonged to the R.N., one
(X) to the R.A.N. These four were recom-
mended for promotion. The three R.N. men
were advanced accordingly and are now
lieutenants; the Naval Board in Melbourne
turned the Australian down. The truth is
that the Australian service is over-run by
derelicts from the R.N., many of them dug
up out of retirement on pension, and they
fill the jobs worth having. We shall never
get a real Australian navy that way.
“Quidam” : That Lithgow has been hit hard
by influenza is an illustration of the fact
that congestion is not confined Sydney,
and that congestion doesn’t pay. For years
people have been complaining of the condi-
tions in Lithgow, where the Small Arms
Factory is, and last year the Federal Gov-
ernment was horrified and proposed an ex-
pensive scheme for bettering them. _ But as
many houses are still crammed with more
than one. family, pubs are chockful, board-
ing-houses have their beds running double
shifts, and people are living in disgusting
hovels. Yet for miles around Lithgow there
are vacant acres ; right from the dirty, dusty,
crowded little town away across to Bowen-
fels and South Bowenfels there is vacant
land, and land where the town would have
spread long ago under natural conditions.
But every bit of it is owned; and as the
demand grows so does the price. Commis-
sions (at scale rates) may inquire into the
problem of scarcity of houses, and politicians
whose dearest desire is to propound schemes
which will catch the public eye and at the
same time offend no powerful class or in-
terest. may drivel at great length ; but the
principal cause of scarcity of houses and
overcrowding, in Lithgow and elsewhere, is
the scarcity of land, except at prohibitive
prices, and the reason is the holding out of
use of land by people who don’t want to use
it, or who don’t want to use it properly, but
ask a king’s ransom (actually a lot more, as
kings go at present) from people who re-
quire it.

The Melbourne Labor Conference decided
to limit the education of voters while de-
creasing their age. All matters “relating
to or extolling wars and heroes of wars” are
to be cut out of lesson books, so that if a
defence question arises the future legislator

is to have no knowledge to go upon. It
will be useless even to illustrate a point by
reference to the achievements of David,
George Washington, Napoleon or Cromwell,
for they will be disqualified by reason of
their warlike doings. And when the whole
of the late earth-shaking disturbance is
excised from the school books, the Melbourne
Labor Conference kid won’t even know what
his Public Debt is all about.
In his smug statement on the Adriatic
difficulty Woodrow Wilson either forgot or
deliberately overlooked this: his precious
League of Nations isn’t yet in existence,
and even if it does come into existence there
is no guarantee that it will have more influ-
ence than a mild curate. To tell Italy that
“Austria-Hungary no longer exists” and that
“in the new plan of European order which
centres in the League of Nations aggression
is out of the question” is to ask Italy to
kill the family doctor and go in for faith-
cure after it had been discredited 99 times.
The N. S. Wales Government, following
the bad lead of other Governments, is doing
something by regulation which it wouldn’t
dare to attempt by legislation. No Govern-
ment in N. S. Wales has ever ventured to
stand or fall by a bill to make vaccination
against small-pox compulsory; but by a
regulation, which was given, apparently,
about three minutes’ consideration, inocula-
tion against influenza was made compulsory,
not for the people who crowd the suburban
trams, but for those who use the long-
distance trains.
The asininity of the party system of
government is getting a very good advt. in
Tasmania. A few days before Premier Lee
delivered his policy speech, Opposition-leader
Lyons came out unexpectedly with a policy
which was so much like the thing the Gov-
ernment had in its mind that Lee’s effort had
to be recast. Still, there are at least a
dozen things of first-rate importance which
both lots declare themselves to be hankering
after ; so the commonsense thing is to quit
wasting time in fighting one another and
trying to push one another off the perch, and
get to work to carry through those things
which they both say they are pining for.
But of course they won’t, the chief end of
each being to prove that the other is wholly
different and wholly wrong.
A certain amount of energy manifests
itself these days at Cockatoo Dock, Sydney.
It took two years of struggle to introduce
piecework and high earnings among the
State employees, as against the old policy of
day-work, “going-slow,” constant unrest and
stop-work meetings. But when the “go-
slow” got down to an average of 73 rivets
per man per day, and it became necessary to
\se the works in despair and sack every-
, 10 had to be a change. Now the
' '"V 300 rivets per man per
day, and earning,.. over 10 r» ftr week.
A sort of move has begun
saved Australia many millions and nine,
calamity if it had shown itself earlier. And
as a side-issue a sort of aristocracy of labor
threatens to develop—men who refuse to be
described as “the starving millions” by the
talky bosses of the 0.8. U. It is a cold
day for the men who live by freeing the
slave with their mouths when the slave frees
himself with his hands.
The Argus solemnly announces that
match-making is not a suitable employment
for Australian girls, as it “offers no scope
to the mind and makes small demand upon
the intelligence.” It might follow that up
with an article on the vast mental effort
required to sit on a fence and watch sheep
grow wool.
If the Farmers’ Union can do it, Hagel-
thorn, M.L.C., sometime Vic. Minister for
Agriculture, is to be shoved out of the Leg.
Council at the approaching election, on the
ground that he failed to do his best for the
producer in connection with harvest sales.
But there are other reasons. What seemed
to be the Minister’s arrogance made many a
hard-toiling Backbone itch to
pull him out of his chair. The
chair is gone, but Backbone
won’t be fully satisfied until he
gets Hagelthorn out on the door-
mat.
One of the mushy songs of the mid-Vic-
torian age was “O Willy, We Have Missed
You.” It is what Tudor seems to be sing-
ing to Hughes lately. He tells his Labor
friends that they “must strive to win hack
those who left the party a short time ago.”
Time moves quickly with Tudor; it is only
two or three years since he joined in kicking
out those men whose loss the party now so
deplores.
Of course it is absurd that every Minister
should be responsible for what every other
Minister does; but that is the theory, and
when it is thrown overboard it wall be
because the present system of appointing
Ministers has been abandoned. The Holman
Government wants to preserve the system
without the responsibility. Fuller explained
the other day that Holman wasn’t respon-
sible for something that had been done —
some other Minister was. Now Holman

is this: the Government in itself knows
nothing about the treatment of this epidemic.
It is not a Government of medical experts.’’
That doesn’t really relieve it of one ounce
of responsibility. A Government in itself
knows nothing much about anything. It
isn’t a Government of experts in any sub-
ject. But a Government is supposed to
secure expert advice, and it must be held
fully responsible for whatever it does, acting
(or not acting ) on that advice.
The Easter Conference of the Labor party
in Melbourne illustrated once more that
Labor has become the prey to well-sounding
words. For instance, one of the party’s
new objectives is the “full democratic self-
government of Australia.” The Common-

wealth, which has the power to take over
every single function of government, has a
Parliament consisting of two Houses elected
by men and women without any property or
even educational test; and there is no pro-
perty qualification for candidates for either
House. What is “full democratic self-gov-
ernment” if that isn’t it?
Bung, in Maoriland, who was saved from
obliteration by the soldiers’ vote at the Pro-
hibition poll, insists on one toast only now :
“To arms!”
A curious feature of the League of Nations
scheme is the provision for expelling un-
worthy members. The world has had many
wars to prevent States quitting a kingdom
or empire or republic. But it is hard to
remember a case of a political combine of
any sort fighting to lose territory, with a
scuffle in the doorway as the reluctant prov-
ince was thrust out, and a row r at the
w r indow as it tried to clamber in again.
In the Auckland Police Court Wilson,
S.M., fining a soldier for a civil offence,
broke o«t in this fashion the other day :
Soldiers in uniform should not be charged in
civil courts. Men still under military jurisdiction
should be dealt with by the military authorities.
They should not enter the civil court f t all.
Yes, and why should clergymen who commit
civil offences be dealt with by the civil
authority? Why shouldn’t they be tried by
their bishops or presbyteries? And why
shouldn’t the Railway Department try all
railway employees? It would be just as
competent as the Defence Department.
The bulk of the N. S. Wales Civil Service
hasn’t had its salary raised for four years,
which means, in view of the increased cost
of imported goods, that it has had its effec-
tive wage reduced from £2OO to £l2O. The
news has now been broken to it that its
rise is again postponed, and it is astonished.
The fact is that there is more Civil Service
than the land can afford. Many depart-
ments could serve five times the population
without much increased effort. The State
Astronomer, for instance, could look at the
stars for 200,000,000 as easily as for
2,000,000, and a country copper with
a large beat could keep order among
500 inhabitants as w T ell as among 50 and feel
less lonesome. If the people who made our
clothes and ironware and paper and cigars
were here instead of elsewhere there would
be several times as many taxpayers, and the
deserving public servant could have his pay
doubled. A good part of the service, how-
ever, votes the Freetrade ticket so as to keep
down the number of contributors to its
wages. Then it gets the wage it deserves.
One of the proposals to be considered by
the Australian Labor Conference reads: —
That all cold storage be taken over by the Com-
monwealth Government so as to be able to control
the people’s food.
Presumably the idea is that the Common-
wealth Government will be able to control
the price of the people’s food. In the year
to June, 19.16, before the shipping collapse
became really bad, Australia imported
£12,600,000 worth of food. Even if that lot
had been frozen till it was as hard as iron,
the price wouldn’t have diminished.
Italy’s demand for the wholesale return
of paintings and statuary from Austria isn’t
the mere frill it looks, but plain
sense. Almost everything of
value in the Austrian art gal-
leries was looted from Italy.
Lombardy and Venice were prac-
tically stripped before the Aus-
trians gave them up after the
wars of 1855) and 18(50. Italy
produces neither coal nor iron,
but it grows pictures and images.
It makes more by showing its art
treasures to wealthy tourists than
out of all its industrial minerals.
So it simply demands that its
tools of trade shall be returned
to it, just as France demands the
return of its looms and engines.
A good deal of last week was
spent by N. S. Wales coal-miners’
officials in growling that the
State Government had spoiled
everything by its “intrusion,” and
if there was a strike the Holman
Ministers would be responsible
for it. What the State Govern-
ment did was to appoint a Com-
missioner to inquire deeply into
the whole coal-mining business in
N. S. Wales, particularly as to
costs, earnings, etc. No just
settlement, of the wages question,
at any rate, could be made with-
out such inquiry. It looks as
though the miners’ leaders don’t
want a just settlement. What
they are after, if their complaints
v- Mother
settlement on the lines of the one
made by Hughes with the unwor-
thy assistance of Judge Edmunds
—a settlement in which the
public was ruthlessly sacrificed.
Woodrow Wilson, introducing the League
of Nations while peace terms were unsettled
and a few tens of millions of soldiers were
still under arms, reminds this paper of a
dear old gentleman who once attended a
public meeting at Bungaree or thereabouts.
The meeting had been called to discuss graz-
ing rights on the town common, and as the
settlement of that bovine problem was pro-
ceeding so smoothly the nice old gentleman
thought it would be an appropriate time to
suggest that it would be a pleasanter world
if Bungaree gave three cheers now and then
for William of Orange. Somehow the old
gentleman seemed quite surprised when the
meeting broke up in disorder without settling
anything about the town common, after all.
The Hun Parliament at Weimar has de-
cided that the Hun should not accept a
“peace of force,” but only a “peace of recon-
ciliation." If the Hun had fought a war
of reconciliation, instead of the beastly
thing he did, there might be some point in
the idea.
This is supposed to be the day of the
revival of the submerged nations, and a vali-
ant soul has revived the old Roman Empire
single-handed. The Patriarch at Constan-
tinople lately hoisted over his local Vatican
the old flag that went down in 1453. Pre-
sumably it was a protest against the pro-
posal to put the old Roman capital, under the
control of a raw, rich new race which hadn’t
even begun to exist then, let alone to pack
pork at Chicago and wear an initial in the
middle of its name.
The election of Socialist-lawyer Maurice
Blackburn as president of the A.L.P. (Vic.
branch) shows how completely the red-
flagger of the once-insignificant Socialist
party has eaten his way into the political
Labor movement. Blackburn used to edit
the Socialist. Now he runs the Labor
Call. He was one of the “intellectuals” who
used to slap Labor on the wrists at every
opportunity. Now the political wing of the
Labor organisation hails him as its pre-
lector. The irony of the situation is that,
though the Labor movement in Vic. was at
one time run almost entirely by trades-
unionists, any A.L.P. branch-meeting nowa-
days consists mostly of people who don’t
belong to unions. The working unionist, on
whose alleged behalf these kindly souls thus
get together, mostly stays at home and
curses liis saviours.
APRIL 25.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A people bowed its head.
No words were said;
But under April skies
We saw them rise —
The living, who were dead.
It is the Anzac men,
Marching and marching by,
One with the pride of ten
And a great look under the sky;
Brown as the grass of the west.
When the rains sleep over the sea.
And a high thought and a zest
For all that is yet to be.
They are sleeping under little white crosses,
They are lying on the ridges where they feii;
Make a counting of the tears and the losses
That the world know the sorrow we would tell.
It. is the Anzac hosts,
Marching and marching on,
Down by the cloudy coasts
Where a young, dead day is gone.
Young are they in their pride,
Young in their laughter high;
For they know where a swift fear died
In a truth that ebulu
They are not beneath the little white crosses,
They are not upon’Hhe ridges where they fell;
Count the gains, ye who pause to count the losses,
And be glad for the glory that they tell.
It is the Anzac flame
Moving and moving on wind—
Magic and music of a name
When God, in His tears, sat blind !
One with the pride of ten,
And ten with the pride of all,
They march through the hearts of men
Whose dreams are a trumpet call.
They are marching under great white crosses,
While star to star the wonder still shall tell,
Recking not of little gains and little losses,
“It is well! It is well! It is well!’’

For the first time income in the Ordinary
Department lias climbed into the five mil-
lions. Progress has been very rapid lately:
it took seven years to get from the third to
the fourth million, and only another four to
reach the fifth. Interest earnings alone
provide nearly £400,000 more than four
years ago. Funds now exceed 874 millions;
including the Industrial branch, over 89 mil-
lions. How great is the management’s re-
sponsibility is indicated by the fact that
these* funds represent a trust equal to one-
third of the total deposits in the savings
banks throughout the Commonwealth.
Claims swallowed GG.S p.c. of the income,
compared with 70.6 p.c. for the previous
year, and 55.2 p.c. for 1914. Over three-
quarters of a million went in war losses, and
the ’flu in Maoriland also cost something.
Apart from these war claims the loss rate
for 1918 Mas 51.4 p.c. Despite increased
business and additional interest earnings,
the surplus is still over a quarter of a mil-
lion less than in the year before Australia
went into action. Altogether the A.M.P.
lias paid out more than £2,500,000 in war
claims—£l.BBo,ooo of it on old policies
carrying no extra premium. This has been
a heavy loss to the Society, for the great
majority of the policyholders who went west
were young and had paid comparatively
little in premiums. But in all probability
the A.M.P. won’t be a loser by the war, in
the long run, for war finance has had this
effect on interest earnings :—• *

And tin* best judges are anticipating good
interest earnings for many years to come.
Last year’s return was practically 9s. p.c.
better than in 1914, and on 874 millions of
funds. that means £168,750 per annum.
Allowing for the prospective increase of_
funds and the likelihood of maintained in-
terest earnings, the A.M.P. should make
good its war losses in 10 to 12 years from
increased income from investments.
The position from the point of view of
expenses is satisfactory. A number of life
concerns deduct taxes from interest earn-
ings ; the A.M.P. includes them with other
exes The figures over a number of vears
work out this way:—

The ratios for 1917 and 1918. however, do
not give the true position. In the former
year a hungry Maoriland Treasurer took too
great a bite and afterwards relented. The
191 < figures carried the full weight of the
extra grab, and last year’s have benefited
by a rebate and also the smaller demands.
Over the two years the expense rate has been
£8 14s. 9d. p.c. of gross income. This is less
than in 1914, though the management has
been _ put to extra expense. Deducting
taxation, the comparison is considerably
better. In 1914, exes., apart from taxes,
took £( l_s. 10d. p.c. of income; for the
past two years £6 16s. lOd.
Last year the Society got in record new
business, 22,054 policies assuring £7,977,670
and bringing in £294,681 p.a. These figures,
as those of other life offices, show the effect
of artificial prosperity. The new policies
written in 1914 averaged £2BB apiece; last
year the average was £355. And no less
than 38 p.c. of last year’s new business
represented further insurance taken up by
old policyholders. A lot of this must have
cost next to nothing. However, The Bul-
letin’s method of charging the renewal
business with 7 p.c. of the exes, and annui-
ties with 3 p.c., and debiting the rest against
new business, gives these results: —

The Maoriland Treasurer is again respon-
sible for spoiling comparisons. Deducting
taxation, last year’s new business cost was
46.8 p.c.; for the previous year 49.7 p.c.;
and in 1914 (the best of earlier years) 64
p.c. Larger individual assurances and new
policies taken out by old policyholders are
no doubt chiefly responsible for pulling down
the figures, which are now highly satisfac-
tory.
Bonuses are again looking up. Actuary
Elliott estimated that at Dec. 31 there was
a surplus of £1,197,931. The valuation
was made as to most of the policies on the
basis.of funds earning only 3 p.c. in future,
and as the actual earnings for the past year
exceeded 5 p.c. a huge internal reserve is
created. The termination of the war has
helped this year’s surplus: about £240,000
of the £253,000 liability under special war
policies is no longer regarded as a liability
and has been transferred to distributable
surplus. Of the amount available, £50,000
has been added to the reserve for contingen-
cies (now amounting to £170,000), and the
actuary recommends the distribution of
£1,005.931. This brings the bonus rate
back to within a few points of normal: —
1888-1893 (boomyears) . . 40.3 p.c. of premiums.

The investment of the combined Ordinary

Record business was written last year, the
new policies averaging £47 apiece, compared
with under £3B four years ago. These
figures indicate that a lot of people who have
gone into the Industrial branch ought to
have secured the infinitely greater benefits
to t>e secured on the Ordinary side. Indus-
trial exes, last year were 28.8 p.c. of the
income—a great achievement when com-
pared with the 88.8 p.c. of 1907, 37.6 p.c.
five years ago, and even the 33.7 p.c. for
1917. Nevertheless, £2O more per £lOO of
income is swallowed up in exes, in this
department than in the Ordinary, which
means that there is £2O less in each £lOO of
income available for benefits. However,
there was a surplus of £33.285 to be distri-
buted after the actuary had made his valua-
tions.

Why the past year’s profits, before provid-
ing for war-time profits taxation, should
have been double those for the previous year
The Bulletin does not know. There has
been something mysterious about this co.’s
disclosed profits since it took over the old
business six years ago. The prospectus had
a few words from an auditor to the effect that
the average profits of the old concern during
its last eight years indicated that this co.
“would, on your present turnover, be able to
pay” £21,000 in dividends and carry forward
nearly £lO,OOO. Actually for the five years
1914-18 it distributed only an average of
£10,910 per annum and then had an average
of only just over £6300 each year available
for reserves. So it was doing little better
than half the prospectus anticipation. Now
the profits have doubled in one year, gross
profits leaping by £38,656 and exes, increas-
ing by £17,220. xintl the figures of a year
ago were considerably better than those pre-
viously shown. Over the period 1915-17
exes, (apart from debenture interest) swal-
lowed 84.5 p.c. of the gross profits; for the
past year the bite was reduced to 75.9 p.c.
From all this it is clear that during the first
five years of the co. it was either having a
comparatively bad time, while conditions
for the trade were good, or tire management
was doing some patching on the quiet. The
directors have not been at all communicative
concerning the disappointing figures, but
since they now talk of the “substantially
improved results,” there is a hint that trad-
ing in the earlier years had not come up to
specifications.
As the table shows, reserves have now
been accumulated to cover the £50,000 of
goodwill and £16,162 besides. For the
business the vendors got £lOO,OOO in 5 p.c.
debentures, £36,000 in 6$ p.c. cum. prefs.
and £30,000 in ordinaries, with £50,000 in
deferred ordinaries for goodwill. Until this
year no div. had been paid on these
deferreds, but as they automatically became
ordinaries when £30,000 of reserves had been
accumulated they now get their full 10 p.c.
along with the others. Apart from the
£lOO,OOO debentures issued to the vendors,
the co. has been carrying a heavy load of
debt, and at the end of last year it had been
heaped higher as a result of the unexpected
arrival of new goods due to the sudden col-
lapse of Wilhelm. The effect on the bal-
ance-sheet is shown in this comparison :
1915. 1918. 1919.

debentures) .. .. £134,585 £259,666 £414,252

Cash, etc. . . . . 18,138 35,023 10,813
Capital is £220,000. and there is the
£lOO,OOO of vendors’ debentures. The struc-
ture at January 31 last was thus top-heavy,
and the 55,000 new £1 ordinaries the co. is
offering to present holders in the proportion
of one for four (and which the Baillieus are
kindly underwriting for a consideration of
£2750) does not ease the load to any great
extent. However, since the balance, no
doubt the position has been eased by the
unloading of stocks, which were so abnor-
mally large that the management must have
felt a little uneasy about the likelihood of the
retail trade absorbing the expensive stuff
before factory prices slumped. But the
chances of the large, costly accumulations
being left on the co.’s hands to scatter at
bargain prices seem less likely now than a
few months ago; for so far there are no in-
dications that, with peace, factory prices
will come down with a sudden run. ' In fact,
the tendency is apparently in the opposite
direction. Undoubtedly this and other rag
cos. have had excellent profit-earning oppor-
tunities during the past couple of years—
thanks to the war-borrowing boom and
because Miss Australia Jane and so many
of her sisters have become wage-earners in
Digger’s absence. How' things are going to
work out when the scattering of lOU’s ceases
nobody knows for certain. But if Beath-
Schiess’s can nurse its stocks without in-
curring loss, things would have to be pretty
bnd before shareholders were denied a taste.
The prefs.’ div. and 10 p.c. on the ordinaries,
after the new* issue has been put out, would
call for £24.000, while last year after the
prefs. had had their cut there was a balance
of profit equal to nearly 24 p.c. of the in-
creased ordinary capital.

This co. gets its bread-and-butter out of
ships and coal, but there is not one vessel
or any mine property on its books. It is
a holding concern, and apart from a lot of
cash and some freehold premises most of its
funds are in the item: “Shares in other cos.
at valuation, £2,045,753.” Five years ago
Howard Smith Co., Ltd., decided to separate
its shipping and coal businesses. Austra-
lian Steamships, Ltd., was formed to take
over the fleet, and Caledonian Collieries. Ltd.,
the coal interests. Before the old co. was
interred its pockets were searched, and over
three-quarters of a million was found stuffed
away. So assets were written up and the
new co. credited ordinaries with live £l.
shares for every one previously held, and
made the 500,000 5 p.c. £1 prefs. a gift of
a further 1 p.c. p.a. Also it presented the
ordinaries with a further £1 share paid to
4s. The remaining 10s. on this last lot
has now been all got in.
The new concern has been doing much
better than the old co; professed to do; and
The Bulletin would not be surprised to
learn that the co. is doing even better than
it shows. The past few years have been
wonderfully profitable for shipping cos., and
colliery proprietors have not been driven to
apply for Government relief. Howard
Smith’s balance-sheet, us a matter of fact,
tells you.next to nothing. You learn that
the “net earnings” were £2oo,7l)4—that’s all,
except that £lO,OOO has been set aside for
taxation and contingencies. What the post-
mortemist recmires is the accounts of Aus-
tralian Steamships, Ltd., and though for the
first couple of years they were published to
the world, the directors have thought better
of it, and now keep the figures to themselves.
No idea can be got of what profits Aus-
tralian Steamships, Ltd., has made recently,
but judging by other cos. they must have
been fat. Nor is there any clue as to sur-
pluses got as a result of selling vessels at
prices in excess of book values. These
amounts, together with the allowances for
depreciation, contingencies, etc., and accu-
mulated profits after paying divs. to the
parent concern, are all hidden. No doubt,
since they are now getting a very sweet 10
p.c. on their increased capital, shareholders
are quite content to leave everything to the
management and ask no questions. The fact
that the man on the bridge was able to find
£772,779 hidden away in the old concern
before it was scuttled six years ago has made
shareholders feel confident that Australian
Steamships is at least being kept in good
repair. Still, they can never know much
about their investment —unless the directors
feel confiding. A couple of weeks ago a
shareholder in another holding concern, the
British Tobacco Co. (Australia), Ltd., was
inquisitive at the annual meeting, and asked
about the undivided profits of the subsidiary
cos. This is all he got:—
Chairman: The undivided profits of the subsidiary
cos. are well maintained.
Another shareholder: Perhaps you can give us a
little further assurance, Mr. Chairman, that there
are profits.
Chairman: I can assure you, sir, that there are
profits.
The shareholder in a holding concern takes
a lot on trust.

This is the concern which took over the
Howard Smith coal interests when that co.’s
directors decided that there were several
good reasons for discontinuing the old habit
of mixing ships and coal-mines in the same
balance-sheet. In the case of Australian
Steamships, Ltd., Howard Smith’s own all
the shares, and the co. is under no obligation
to publish its subsidiary concern’s accounts..
In the case of the Caledonian Collieries,
however, the parent co. was unable to
finance all the mine purchases without out-
side assistance, and for that reason this
partly-subsidinry co. is obliged to distribute
a few figures about itself each year. . Not
that they are of much value, as will be
shown later. Originally the Caledonian was
a Scotch concern (it was registered in Glas-
gow in 1895), and the old firm of Howard
Smith's acted as managing-agents. The
properties included the West Wallsend, West.
Wallsend Extended, Waratah, Aberdare and
Aberdare Extended. Howard Smith’s grad-
ually bought into the old co. and finallv
successfully negotiated to take over the
whole outfit. When the present co. was
formed, the holding concern took 600,000 £1
ordinaries and 192,500 £1 6 p.c. cum. prefs.,
which carry the right to share point for
point with the ordinaries up to 8 p.c. To
finance the enterprise Howard Smith share-
holders were invited to take up 50,000 prefs.
on their own account. Since then there
have been considerable additional property
purchases and further capital has been got.

If Royal Commissioner Campbell, who is
conducting a comprehensive inquiry into the
industry, had to depend on the various cos.’
published figures to ascertain true profits,
exes., etc., lie would not learn much. For in-
stance, Caledonian Collieries does not publish
a separate P. and L. account. It merely
inserts a line in its balance-sheet: “Balance
for the year, £77,006.” Shareholders (and
the public) are quite in the dark as to how
these figures were arrived at. There is no
whisper as to gross profits, the proportion
swallowed up by expenses, etc. There is
no indication of the allowance made for
depreciation; and disclosed profits can be
nicely regulated through that item. Any
inquiry into profits is worthless unless the
amounts written off mine properties are
considered. In the case of concerns which
are not busy acquiring or equipping mines,
a fair idea of what is being clipped from
profits can be got by watching the growth of
liquid assets. Whatever Caledonian Col-
lieries has set aside for depreciation of old
properties has gone into further mine in-
terests, and apparently no attempt has been
made tlmsfar to provide a sinking fund in-
vested apart from the business, unless the
£2450 of War Loans now on the books is
intended as a nucleus. Since 1912
£308,758 of new capital has been got in, and
the book value of properties, etc., has grown
by £357,080. The surplus of liquid assets
has increased from £32,954 at Dec., 1913, to
£44,632 at the latest balance; meantime the
prefs. have had divs. totalling 33 p.c. and the
ordinaries 29 p.c.

This manufacturing co. is developing nicely ;
its gross profits (now £88.610) have ex-
panded well over 40 p.c. during the past five
years. As prospects continue bright, the
nauagement has lately secured further fac-
tory accommodation and installed a lot of
new plant. This expansion will mean better
profits if all goes well, but meantime the co.
has gone a little further into debt:—

By keeping the dividend down, surplus
profits have provided the greater proportion
of the funds required to push out. Since
1013 £19,489 has been got in by new share
issues and premiums thereon. Liabilities
over the same period have grown by £19,100,
while no less than £46,676 of reserves have
been accumulated. Shareholders have been
very patient, for while this £46,676 of profits
has been kept in the business, their dividend
distributions have amounted to only £50,881,
equal to just a shade over 5 p.c. p.a. on
their capital. The co.’s position is now
very comfortable. After adding another
£42,535 to the book value of properties and
plant, the surplus of more or less liquid
assets over liabilities has increased from
£58,681-to £86,601 in the six years.
“Whitepen”: One of the reasons for the
present low price of War Bonds is that
employers backed up their men in investing
in War Loans, and to a large extent these
groups have broken down, owing to dis-
missals and disinclination to complete. But
is r this any reason why a small holder of
War Bonds should be at the mercy of the
brokers? If he has War Savings Certiti-
cates his treatment by the Commonwealth
Government is very different. A purchaser
of £lOO worth of bonds on October 1, 1918,
who sold on April 1, 1919, received for his
£lOO only £96 Bs. A purchaser of £lOO
worth of War Savings Certificates would
receive £lOl 10s. Bd. Is there any sane
reason why one man should be treated" differ-
ently from the other? You can purchase
certificates in amounts from £1 to £lOOO, all
redeemable any time at 3 per cent. Why
can’t bonds up to £lOOO be placed on the
same footing? This would go far towards
preventing the market being knocked to
pieces, as it has been thus far, to the great
prejudice of future loans.
Acting Prime Minister Watt told N. 8.
Wales Mines Minister Fitzpatrick last week
that the Prime Minister is still negotiating
with the British Government for a sale of
Australian copper, and it was “hoped that
a decision would be reached this week.”
Needless to say no decision has since been
announced. The number of times that a
decision is “hoped for this week” would be
humorous were it not so serious. Watt’s
Government refuses to guarantee pi’oducers
£BO per ton for the time being, yet has the
cool cheek to expect the British Govern-
ment to settle the trouble for it. It
is time this country ceased to be a mendi-
cant. Copper is an article which coun-
tries are supposed to trade in, and if the
trade of this country is to be looked after
by the British Government, then it’s time
that some of our politicians ceased to draw
their salaries. The British Government’s
attitude towards its traders since the
armistice is such as to hold out little hope
of Australia receiving support on the grounds
that it deserves charity. In a copper sense
there is only one thing barring the way,
and that is the Federal Government. Watt
may not know this, but it’s time he found
out.

“Foseo’s” farewell: —
Just dead, Fred C. Howard, managing-director
of Broken Hill South and director of other con-
cerns. His mining experience was nil when Tony
Fotheringham recommended him to Adelaide dentist
Rodway as the likely one to smash the Queen-street
crowd which, back in the ’9o's, ran the South from
Dick Ford’s office. ltodway had bought cheaply over
20,000 shares of the 200,000 on the South register,
chiefly on the strength of T. J. Greenway’s belief that
the South must, at depth, get the shoots from
Block 10 and the Central. The fight for possession
of control was Homeric, but Adelaide piled up its
holdings till it was able to win by sheer weight.
So the Queen-street office, though retained nominally
as headquarters, was subject to Howard’s Adelaide
office, where ledgers and pretty well everything else
were kept. Once Howard grasped the mine’s possi-
bilities he went for young blood with technical
training rather than the miner of the practical type.
So Wainwright and Cunningham and Mcßride were
put on the staff, and these and others developed as
the brains of the show. But Howard tripped badly
when he and his colleagues sold the South Blocks
to 8., M. and Co.; also when Hoover, W. L. Baillieu
and H. J. Daly got hold of the tailings for their
flotation process. If the South’s tails had been
worked by the co. on its own account, instead of
being either let go under a flat rate to the Zinc
Corporation, or sold on a profit-sharing basis to
the De Bavay crowd, the South divs. would have
been much larger. And what a difference if South
Blocks had been held! A fiery Hotspur in his
crusade against levying an export duty on the ship-
ment of lead concentrates, Howard changed his tune
when the South and the North, through W. L. Bail-
lieu, bought the superior interest in the Port Pirie
smelters. He long wanted to go into that Amal-
gamated Zinc-De Bavay pup, the Electrolytic Zinc,
but Beaumont Moulden and Hyndman were in the
way. Still, about his last big act in the South
was to recommend that partnership. There is talk
that Adelaide intends to put up a new man for the
vacancy, so as to retain control. It will be strange
if Collins House doesn’t provide Howard’s successor,
as it would be awkward to get an opponent in his
seat. A fact never disclosed during Howard’s reign
was the salary paid him as managing-director. It
was always debited to mine account.

Base metal stocks in Britain at the begin-
ning of April were larger than at the end of
11)18 except in the case of aluminium. This
means that the consumption since the armis-
tice has been Pss than the deliveries, which
would doubtless be in respect of purchases
made before the armistice. In round figures
the increases in the British stocks were as
follows: copper, 13,000 tons; spelter, 8000
tons; lead, 14,000 tons; nickel, 400 tons;
antimony, 800 tons. The aluminium stocks
had been reduced by 700 tons. The actual
stocks of greatest interest to Australia were:
copper, 48.702 tons; speltex-, 38,047 tons;
and lead, 96,456 tons.
Y-Watei-, Emmaville (N.S.W.), made a
loss of £3046 last half-year on an output of
89J tons tin oxide. This took £16.544 to
get, against £16,527 spent to win 87| tons in
the July term; so that, even though the
ground was hard and the run of tin narrow,
a profit would have shown up had not the
returns from sales dwindled from £21,852
to £14,370. All the P. and L, balance with
a bit out of equalisation reserve had to go
to square up the ledger and add something
to the reserve for depreciation. With tin
down to £220, finances are still the problem
ahead, for the bank is owed £10,572 apart
from debts to sundry ci-editors of £2128.
On the other side, the co. had £6059 of
metal unsold, as well as stores, fuel, etc.,
worth £6667, and was owed £2054. With
the slump in tin, it can’t be expected that
divs. will be likely for some time. Still,
the softer ground ahead may provide a sur-
prise. That patch has bored about lib.
per cub. yd. The average ground sluiced
by the co. to date is 1.1131 b., 4,997,000 cub.
yds. treated having provided 24734 tons
black tin.
*■ * * *
Ivampong Kamunting’s two dredges con-
tinue to tear out profits at Taiping
(F.M.S.). During February 149,000 cub.
yds. were treated for over 63 tons tin oxide,
showing a recovery of .951 b. per yd. With
tin oxide fetching slightly under £ll9, the
output was worth £7530 and the working
profit was £4415. At this rate, the dredges
are pouring out profits foi fc shareholders at
the rate of nearly £8 per working hour.
“In a sound financial position,” is how
the Edna Central (W.A.) directors report
that co.’s affairs. Against stores on hand,
£4600, and cash, gold arid War Loan, £6638,
there are liabilities of only £1290. The
directors also include plant and buildings,
£23,598, in their tally, but under the hammer
mining stuff wilts, so it is best to discard it
when building up a statement of liquid
assets. But the position isn’t so bright if
dividends are to be taken as the test. To
date Central has paid £9OOO. To do that
the co. has crushed 113,354 tons for
38,5210 z. gold worth £172,140, while in addi-
tion capital account has been built up to
£37,500. According to N. E. Giblin, 16,000
tons ore above the 321 ft. level await break-
ing, the grade being 40s. per ton. On the
basis of costs for last half-year the ore will
not pay, for expenditure and depreciation
ran out at 465. lOd. per ton. Even exqlud-
ing writings-off, costs were just about the
40s. mark. This was because of a neces-
sary scramble for ore as the result of the
water trouble. If the past six months’
figures be discarded, and those for the two
previous terms taken, 40s. ore gives only
about a ss. per ton margin of profit, which,
with the Edna May in all probability ceasing
to pump before very long, isn’t wide. Last
half-year’s work ended in a loss of £157, due
to development taking £6896 and deprecia-
tion £2843. On working account the profit
was £2567. So it is obvious that the day
of. big things has yet to come. Hats are
being hung up on the possibility of a new
mine being opened up from the shoots that
come into the eastern portion of the claim
from the Consolidated’s lease. Work on the
Middle lode there shows it to range up to
22ft. wide. Then ahead at No. 4 level the
Main reef has still to be reached and tested.
With the shaft down another lift the New
reef will give more stone. That shoot so
far has been the most consistent producer
in the mine, but it is narrowing as sunk on.
The third string is the possibility of the
Edna shoot itself wandering over the boun-
dary, as it appears to be once more making
towards the border line. Certainly, there
are possibilities, but there are also costs.
On the Westonia field these have been
deadly, except to the Edna May, and there
it was only the high-grade stone that saved
the situation after the water burst through.

Jock Thomson, who recently wrested pos-
session of the Yampi Sound (W.A.) hill of
iron from some Sydney holders, is getting
ready to form a co. to work the deposit.
The ore is declared to be the purest in Aus-
tralia, assaying up to about 70 p.c. metallic
iron. Harnessing the 40ft. tides, with a
view to the establishment of electric smel-
ters, is talked of.

Though Maoriland’s Westport-Stockton
colliery won 355,563 tons coal worth
£82.034 last year, the ordinaries had to go
without a taste. Bad luck dogged the co.
during the second half of the year, and the
output was over 11,000 tons short of the
previous year’s total. Practically two months
were lost by strikes, a magazine explosion,
’flu, and lack of shipping. Labor was scarce,
freights and other costs soared, while income-
tax swallowed £4606. Tlie result was a net
profit of only £7958. of which £3SIB went in
paying the. prefs. their 8 p.c., while £4OOO
was set aside for depreciation. Apart from
±40.625 of debentures the co. owes £19,300
and has £28,406 in liouid assets. From
shareholders’ point of view there is an
excess 0 f liabilities over assets, apart from
the mine property and office furnishings, etc.,
amounting to over £22,600. The Bulletin
does not know what is the probable life of
tne mine, but considering the co. is now in
its twelfth year, the present financial posi-

Just-dead IL G. Casey, though chairman
of Mount Morgan and its ally the Electro-
lytic Refining Co., was more widely known
in pastoral and sporting than in mining
circles. For some time he was chairman of
Goldsbrouah, Mort and Co.; also of the
V.R.C. Choice chairmanships were a habit
of his. If W. M- Hughes had not been in the
road, he would probably have found a way
of becoming Chairman of Australia. Early
in the war, Casey, who at that time did not
know- much more about the metal business
than Hughes, came into conflict with the
Prime Minister. Hughes won on points—
mostly War Precautions. But Casey dared
to tell Hughes what he thought, and what
Casey thougnt will in due course be appre-
ciated by those who failed to back him up.
As chairman of the Walter and Eliza Hall
Trust, Casey, in conjunction with Kelso
King, the trusted guide of the deceased
millionaii’e, was a born distributor of some-
body else’s charity. But he was capable of
much kindness himself, although in later
years, owing to ill-health, those coming in
contact with him would have been inclined
to misjudge him.
Larry O’Hara, Labor’s selected for Pad-
dington (N.S.W.), is a young man in the
late twenties. A clerk in the Public Ser-
vice, his politics are at variance with his
environment; even the industrial section of
which he has been a member was latterly in
danger of losing him because it was too con-
servative. His ceaseless opposition to
Federal member J. E. West and ex-M.L.A.
Osborne had left him rather weak in the
Labor League, but there were enough affili-
ated unionists to tip the scales in liis favor.
Lately the Labor executive decided not to
encourage selection ballots for seats already
held by Labor men. O’Hara promptly gave
notice to l-escind that determination. If he
pulls through the election he’s pretty sure to
give notice of motion to amend himself in
some way.
J. J. Benham, dead at Bi-igliton (Vic.) at
83, was formerly a squatting partner of
Wentworth Cavenagh, a prominent 8. Aus.
politician of the last generation, but was
too much of a rolling-stone to belong to any
one State. He claimed to have walked from
Brisbane to Adelaide as early as 1858, and
to have been under Peter Lalor in the
Eureka Stockade at Ballai’at. Before that
he was in the California goldrush of ’49.
Crossed the bar last week-end, at Sydney,
Captain Lancelot Dawson, a famous Torres
Strait pilot. He first felt the sting of
spray as an apprentice aboard the wool-
clipper Cynisca, trading between Sydney
and London. Afterwards he threw in with
the China Navigation Co. and became
skipper of the Taiyuan, dropping off her
gangway to join the Torres Strait service
10 years ago. He had just returned to his
home at North Sydney from a trip to Hong-
kong when the flags were drooped at half-
mast.
“Kaylee”: Cattle-king Kidman is off to
America, and, in the matter of talking, the
Yanks will have nothing to teach him. There
may be method in it, but I have never
known a man bare his business heart to the
same extent as Sydney, who, by
the way, is a refutation of the
myth that cattle-folk can’t live
without swearing. Kidman lias
no drinking or smoking vices either,
but he is one of the most impatient
of men, especially in the auction-
eer’s box, where he plants himself
alongside the salesman, and, when
the bid reaches the altitude he
desires, yells frantic instructions
to knock it down. He has the
lithe body and squai-e shoulders
that suggest great endurance and
strength. He used to look a rough
diamond, but of late a tailor has
taken him in hand, and, though he
hasn’t changed the style of his
clothes, they at least fit him.
Most of the yax-ns you hear about
his early struggles are mythical.
At school he and his brothers were
always the boys who had the most
pocket-money.
The Crown Princess had an in-
ternational reputation for amiabil-
ity ; but, according to her mothei-,
that didn’t save the lady from
being “treated with atrocious bru-
tality” by her loving Holienzollern.
Still the poor fellow desei-ves some
sympathy. The commoner who
beats his wife can do it with a
reasonable amount of privacy and
save the lady’s feelings; but it
must be a tough job to wife-beat
comfortably in a palace haunted by gi-ooms
of the pigsty and other whispering hangers-
on.
Died last week at the reputed age of 103,
Captain Adam Houlsby, who arrived in Aus-
tralia 64 years ago and immediately got
employment with Robert Towns and Co.
Later he became the owner of several small
vessels built at Gosford and traded along
the coast. His was the last boat to sail
from Botany Bay to Liverpool via George’s
River. _ Governor Macquarie had an opti-
mistic idea that Liverpool would become a
port. It got as far as having a Ship Inn,
at any rate.
Just-dead E. C. Longson, S. Australia’s
most successful election agent, was no friend
of the bookmakers, and his lobbying was re-
sponsible for the inti’oduction of the totalisa-
tor. His son was the machine’s first mana-
ger in South Aus.
S. Australia’s valuable Owen Smyth
announces that lie is going to end his days
in England. Adelaide won’t be the same
without him. Since he dropped in, about
43 years ago, from a seafaring life, and had
the office of Superintendent of Public Build-
ings created for him, he has saved the
country thousands of pounds by a kind of
benevolent despotism, never being afraid to
run counter to the wishes of any person

whatsoever if he thought the interests of the
State demanded it. Of his two sons, the
elder was killed on Gallipoli, the younger
is just returning from FTance.
Adelaide and Broken Hill have lost a first-
class man in F. C. Ilowai'd, at 62. He was
a business-man, with no time for public life.
Though his commercial interests were very-
varied, his biggest work was on the Broken
Hill South, to which he gave most of his
time for the last 20 years. The co. was
almost on the rocks when he took it in hand ;
lately it has been making a profit of about
£400,000 a year. Howard married a
daughter of his old partner, W. R. Cave.
William C. M. Finniss, who died the other
day at St. Peters (S.A.j, at the age of 70,
was the only surviving son of B. T. Finniss,
S. Aus.’s first Premier under Responsible
Government. When William Finniss was in
the Audit Office in 1873 the staff consisted
of (besides himself) L. H. Sholl. who later
became Under-Secretary; T. Gill, the pre-
sent Under-Treasurer; Peter Whitington.
who became Commissioner of Audit; H. F.
Peacock, now Controller of Accounts; G. G.
Martin, present sec. to the Attorne>General;
and 11 others. After 46 years there are five
still living of the staff of 17, and all of them
reached the top jobs in the service.
“.Tohnno”: Jack Bruce, best-known of
Torres Strait pilots, is a merry soul. Miss-
ing a steamer on one occasion, lie tried to
jump aboard, but the distance from the
wharf was too great, and he fell into the
watei*. An excited spectator immediately
nlunged in to his rescue, and the two heads
bobbed up simultaneously. “Hullo, old
sport!” chirped Bruce, “did they leave you
behind, too?" Another time while piloting
a steamer, it looked as if the boat was in
danger. The rattled skipper jumped out of
his cabin and called: “This is awful! What
shall I do?” “Get back to your cabin and
put on your best uniform,” calmly advised
the pilot. “You’ll make a better-looking
corpse that way.”
From a Gallery hand: —
If the Nationalists continue to regard the Whip as
heading the list for Ministerial promotion, then John
Thomson, M.11.R., is fore-ordained for some billet
for which he has not the necessary equipment. John
is one of the awfully good old souls whose disposition
towards a quiet and uneventful career over-rides all
Mrs. Thomson’s ambitions to the contrary. The
widow of the late Langlands Jack would like to see
her second husband fastened to a portfolio and cir-
culating on the Ministerial orbit as one of the
Executive satellites of the Governor-General. But
John s sedative personality is an anodyne to every
craving, barring the desire to obtain rest with the
minimum of exertion. He is so tired that he has rarely,
if ever, made a speech, and the meanest Opposition
sniper has never thought him a fair target for
opprobrium. He is one of those political negatives
produced by over-development of the income
and under-development of the reasoning facul-
ties. Completely without egotism or brilliancy, and
with enough money to make his Scotch canniness
look an agreeable eccentricity, he is quite content to
be a safe and unspeaking vote for his party in the
Reps. The day when he opens his mouth in appro-
val or protest, the Empire will be toppling and the
Millennium close at hand.
S. Aus. State Rank has so much to do
that it has cx-eated a new office, Assistant-
Inspector-General. The home-grown INI. F.
McNamara gets it as a matter of course,
having been acting Inspector-General more
than once during his 20-odd years as the
bank’s accountant.
George Arthur Roth, who loved the poli-
tics of the poor but the dinners of the rich,
died at his seaside home in Sandringham
(Vic.) the other day, and was buried in
Footseray, his coffin, covered
with a red flag, being fol-
lowed by official Labor and
Socialist party representa-
tives. Probably h's name
turned his thoughts to Social-
ism after he had missed get-
ting into the Baptist minis-
try ; Roth is German foi-
led. All the same, he would
have seemed a more earnest
apostle if he had chosen to
live with the workers at
Footseray, instead of being
merely buried amongst them.
The Right Rev. John
Stretch had one distinction
among bishops. Native of
Geelong, and long-time citi-
zen of Melbourne, he was
familiarly known as Jack in
both districts, and, with hat
oil the back of his head, and
thumbs in the armholes of
his vest, he was as Jack-like
as a cheery young parson could be. He
was a dean at the lively age of 39, and
bishop at 45.
George Black, M.L.C., who has been the
film censor in Sydney, will no longer be
boi’ed to death with the job. His succes-
sor is Lieut. Frank Day. This returned
Digger, who knows a lot about electrics, can
at least claim a long family connection with
the show business in Australia. His grand-
father was that Montagu who in the dark
ages ran Sydney Punch as a mostly-theatri-
cal paper; and an uncle is Neville Montagu,
who has been Poverty Point’s law-adviser in
Sydney ever since he bought his fii’st chim-
ney-pot hat.
News of Frank Hyett’s death from flu-
monia caused a gasp in Vic. political and
official circles. Although the Argus pre-
tended to the last to regard Hyett as a “Hell-
fire” pex-son, to use one of its own pet
phrases, it knew, as most people did in poli-
tics and newspaper offices, that he was a
FRANK HVETT.
reasonable m a n
who had pressed
the genuine griev-
ances of the rail-
way men. Hyett
was an able de-
bater who knew
that bad temper
would no more
assist him in put-
ting a case than it
would enable his
side to win when
he played cricket
or football. The
railway employees
had him to thank
chiefly for the in-
creases amounting
to £150,000 a year
which they ob-
tained from the
Classification
Board last year.'
Judged by the test
of kindness in an-
other’s trouble and
courage in his own,
Frank Hyett rang
true, and it was
a sorrow-stricken
throng of railway
men that followed
his coffin to Box
Hill cemetery. It
is one of a good
many little things
to the credit of
Bowser that lie forgot political differ-
ences when he heard that the Hyett
family had 'flu, and exerted himself to find
a nurse for the wife and children after the
husband and father had been removed to
St. Vincent’s.
The knightly Grice (Uni. Vice-Chancel-
lor), J. E. Mackey (Speaker) and Prof.
Osborne will be the triumvirate to decide
whether or not struggling students desirous
of taking a University course shall be
granted State loans not exceeding £lOO a
year. The students will be charged 4J per
cent, for the first five years, and 6 per cent,
for the next five years if the loan is renewed.

SOCKETS.

Are they seeking your glory-prize?
Sockets ! Sockets !
Red flesh-pockets !
What hare you done with your eyes?
Oli, the lure of Bellona’s wiles and ways
Where Shyloek leers dowh the callous days!

Where Mammon cheers and his fine cars glide!
Oh, the troopship riding to wonder lands
And the wild emprise hot youth demands!
Then the sands afire,...and the sobering..,.
Then the thud and the flash and the blinding sting!
And away from the shell that shatters and rends
Fat fingers are clutching for dividends.
Pockets! Pockets! Gold-lined pockets!
What hare you done with their eyes?
They stare about them with gaping sockets;
Rut their brains are burning wise.
Well-fitted Pockets !
Sightless Sockets !
God! Which have gained the prize?
Oh, some with the careless skies are blent,
And some are legless and scarred and bent;
But the cruellest, cruellest horror lies
In the nearing out of your bright young eyes.
( Sockets! Sockets! What do you see?
Fire and blood to eternity!)
There are eyes that light at the sight of gold,
But yours are ashes forever cold!
There are eyes that are blazing with Greed and Self—
Oh, your jewels they’ve plundered and pawned for
pelf!
Sockets! Sockets! Gaping sockets!
What hare you done with your eyes?
Your jewels hare gone from their red-rimmed

Are they seeking your glory-prize?
Sockets ! Sockets !
Red flesh-pockets !
What have you done with your eyes?

“N.L.S.” : We were at church at Doulon
under a padre who was C. of E. and very
earnest. Towards the close of his discourse
he began to talk of confession. “I know
it’s not usual,” he said, “for Protestants to
confess; but at the same time if any of you
feel there is anything unclean that you would
like to get rid of, I’ll be here for a few
m ; *:utes afterwards.” An oppressive silence
followed. Then I heard a weary voice behind
me: “tie can have my harness.”

“Essendon”: Apropos Digger songs.
When Fritz broke through in March, ’3.8,
our unit was at Ontersteen, spelling. We
got orders to proceed into action at once;
even the men who had gone on leave that
day were recalled. We moved that night,
and the afternoon was spent, by direction of
a sapient G. 0., in burnishing the mules’
neck chains! There w r as one touch of
humor about it, though. The method was
to put several chains in a bag and shake
them. ' There were about 20 of us in our
stable, and some joker started to swing his
lot to the words, “This is the way to win

the Avar,” sung to the old tune of “Boys and
Girls Come Out to Play.” It spread like
wildfire, and the chorus broke up even the
serg’-major.
“II.O.”: Despite the fuss that has been
made iu Melbourne about the ’flu the death-
rate remains practically normal. For the
first three months of this year the deaths
from all causes numbered 2020, 68 more
than for the same period in 1918, 19 more
than in 1913 and 1914 and nine less than
iu 1916. If there has been a large increase
in the deaths from ’flu, the figures suggest
that there has been almobt a corresponding
decrease in deaths from other causes. As
no reasonable explanation has been offered
as to why there should be a sudden decline
in the death-rate of all diseases bar one, the
obvious inference is that since funk fever
came to Melbourne a variety of diseases have
been labelled ’flu which at ordinary times
would have been called something else. ’Flu
has become a fashion, just as appendicitis
did after King Ned had been operated on
for that complaint.
“En Zed”: The Maoris will have their
tangis. The ’flu took heavy toll of the native
population, and Henare and his friends were
very busy attending these jamborees until
the Health Dept, prohibited the gatherings.
The restrictions are now lifted and our erst-
while cannibal brothers and sisters are travel-
ling from pa to pa, gorging and Availing with
ns much fervor as if the deaths had taken place
yesterday instead of six months ago. A
Maori can howl for a Aveek if the tucker lasts
out. Incidentally Henare drops his bundle
very quickly in sickness. That was the
great problem of the doctors in M.E. during
the epidemic. One chap who had the ’flu
made up his mind to die. but held on as he
had a will to make. The solicitor didn’t
reach the patent in time. The latter got
full up of waiting and took up his bed and
Avalked. Anyhow, he took up the fleas, and
the last I saAv of him he Avas eating dried
shark and pickles at a tangi.
SO THE GAME GOES ON.
“Honest , now, aren't all kisses pretty much the same ?”
“ Ye-e-s —hut the lips are frequently different .”
A Sydney suburban coroner, considering the
facts surrounding the killing of an old man
by a motor-car, gqve
it as his judgment
that from the nature
of the injuries the
chariot must have
been travelling at 20
miles an hour. The
one light on the car
was dull and on the
whole he thought the
driver was guilty of
negligence. Then he
returned a verdict of
accidental death, on
the ground that he
thought no jury would
convict. Presumably
the Justice Depart-
ment will have a few
earnest words with
that coroner, and let
him know that it isn’t
for any coroner to
assume that there
isn’t a jury to be got
His job is to do his
“Centurion”: “Z.H.lv.’s” yarn of the
Syrian kid whose pants were patched with
an addressed parcel-cover recalls another
packet of joy. While patrolling Sinai,
before Romani, we hit a little Bedouin camp
consisting of grandmother, mother and one
fat kid. The little chap’s only garment was
a shirt made of the white calico bag in which
the Sydney Red Cross used to pack its
clothing comforts. Barring three holes
for head and arms, it was intact, and the
Red Cross and the city address were show-
ing well.
There are some steely heroines scattered
among the stylish boarding-houses. One
little lot who lodge on a Sydney hilltop have
among them engaged a nurse to stand by in
case any of the syndicate should catch the
’flu! Meanwhile the cry for skilled help
goes up from the slums and crowded suburbs
where useful citizens are fighting for their
lives. The food-hoarder was scorned in
England when food was short. The nurse-
hoarder in Australia deserves at least one
brick.
“Speargrass”: According to the papers,
the Easter excursion trains from
Sydney were stopped by a bungle.
Apart from those who fleece the
tourist while he waits, the country
was not violently agitated by the
bungle. At present the back-
country denizen entertains a grim
feeling of satisfaction that the
city, which generally takes care to
get everything good that is going,
has at last got something that
makes the country appear a very
desirable place by comparison.
Years and years of careful and
conscientious centralisation, with
the country drained to fill the city
with good things, have not made
the bush resident too friendly to-
wards the octopus, and there is a
certain amount of unholy joy in
the knowledge that the place that
lias extracted tribute from everything that he
had to sell or to buy is now paying the price
of its bloating.

“Th'e Happy Historian”: Budd’s "hanging
on April 24 was the first Adelaide execution
for some years. In the Holy City there is
usually a last-minute rush to find a hang-
man, and, in the case of fisherman Coleman,
it looked like a Sheriff’s job till the eve of
the execution. Coleman was hanged at 8
a.m., and his fellow-workers at the fish
market stood bareheaded from the first to
the last stroke of the hour. As far as I
am aware no censorship is exercised any-
where in Australia over the executioner’s
costume. He hides just as much of his
face as he wishes and wears whatever he
pleases. In Melbourne —I think it was
two hangings ago—the executioner affected
false whiskers, giving a horrible theatrical
touch to the proceedings. But the modern
hangman has never given the fashionable
touch to his job that the executioner of Ah
Chong did at Darlinghurst Gaol in 187 G,
when he was “habited in a tightly-buttoned
and well-fitting double-breasted black frock
coat, black cloth trousers, kid boots, well-
brushed black silk hat and white necktie.
He had elegant shirt-studs and elaborate
wristbands, and a cambric handkerchief
peeped from one of his pockets.” In effect,
got up to kill.

The Maoriland War Cry -
Alcohol will remove stains from summer clothes.
It will remove summer clothes, spring clothes, winter
clothes and autumn clothes. It also removes the
household furniture, the eatables from the pantry,
the smiles from the face of the wife, the laugh from
the innocent lips of the children, and the happiness
from the home. As a remover of things alcohol has
no equal.
How about asking Webster and Pearce to
have a drink?
“Port Road”: W. C. Harrison and Co., o'
Adelaide, corroborate “Gadsden’s” statement
(B. 17/4/T9) that Japanese millers are till-
ing bags bearing the trade-marks of popular
Australian millers. They have been informed
by most reliable witnesses that their “Kan-
garoo” brand has been put on the market in
Java by Japanese makers. It is bad enough
to place Japanese millers in the position of
being able to sell Australian wheat that went
through two mice plagues, but to have such
inferior flour put on
the markets under
reputable Australian
brands is intolerable,
and ought to have the
immediate attention
of the Commonwealth
Government.

“Bill Blank”: “Longun” might not have
been the tallest man in the A.1.F., but he
was close on seven feet. One day as we
were passing a Tommy labor corps a humor-
ist sang out, “Hey, Digger, reach us down a
star!” “Longun” placed his rifle and gear
on the road, walked up to the astonished
Tommy and tapped him between the eyes.
“There,” he said, “take your pick of those.”
* * * *
“Palmerston” : Of course there is an inner
history of the seething troubles that led up
to the so-called attack on Government House
in Darwin just before Christmas. This is
part of it. Soon after the armistice was
signed someone collected £6O to give the chil-
dren a blow-out. The Mayor convened a
public meeting for a Thursday night to decide
how the money should be spent. On the
morning the notice was published invitations
went out to the principal patriotic workers
for a dinner at Government House on the
night fixed for the Mayor’s meeting. That
was the last straw. Whether the Mayor
wanted to “queer” the dinner or whether
Government House wanted to “queer” the
public meeting was hotly discussed, and as
Darwin decided that the evidence was against
Government House it reckoned the time had
come to “queer” Government House. And
as Administrator Gilruth has left, not to
return, the Mayor’s party counts itself the
winner.

“Pulex”: A month ago I told The
Bulletin, that a front-rank Sydney doctor
was carrying his ’flu mask in his boots. He
arraigned the flea as a distributor of the dis-
ease, and accordingly gave his socks a dose
of formalin. Now word comes from Den-
mark that Dr. Engelbreth, of Copenhagen,
has also put the insect in the dock and
brought damning evidence against him.
Fleas that had been encouraged to feast on a
’flu patient were given the run of two
healthy young men. and 30 hours afterwards
there was a second application. Both the
young men became ill within two days,
exhibiting the usual symptoms of the dis-
ease. They were taken in hand then, and,
it is satisfactory to learn, made a good re-
covery. The theory that infected droplets
from the throat and nose are not wholly
responsible receives further support from
the outbreak of the disease on the Niagara
after the long quarantine in Auckland. And
if the flea, the question is whether the mos-
quito also should not come under suspicion.
And other reptiles less pleasant even than
the mosquito.

A BALLADE OF A GREY BOLSHEVIK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The puny kings may walk in fear,
With humbled heads held meek and low;
The hungry crowds may surge £fnd jeer,
While heavy feet tramp to and fro
To win new life from days of woe;
Old creeds be split from skull to chin ;
But, as the tides of battle flow,
Death the grey Bolshevik will win.
The great may strut, the small may cheer;
The mighty ones may draw the bow
Upon the men of brawn and beer;
The horny hands which used to sow
May lift a blood-stained naked hoe
To put a strange new harvest in.
No matter how their crops may grow,
Death the grey Bolshevik will win.
lted fiends may through the people leer,
Or mighty visions burn and glow
To bring the kind Millennium near;
And all the little puppet show
Of king and duke may fail and go,
And all mankind become akin.
But there are always shrouds to sew;
Death the grey Bolshevik will win.
Envoy.
Prince I would comfort thee, and, so,
Consider: royal ranks grow thin,
But e’en the people feel his blow—
Death the grey Bolshevik will win.
VICTORIA.

(he mortuary man at this ’Hu hospital. He
is a painstaking chap, who loves his work.
When he first arrived the mortuary could
accommodate only three bodies, so Bill got
busy. Next day the medical superintendent
asked him for a progress report and re-
ceived a verbal one. “Send ’em along,” Bill
said. “I've got room now for 50.” In a
few days he felt he was being a bit neg-
lected. and took his troubles to the matron.
She wrote “Mortuary” in three-inch letters
across the front of his white tunic. Now
his chief delight is to stand in full view of
(he public in his robe of office beneath his
hand-painted direction sign: “To the
Morgue.”
“Copabella”: The case (it was at a Mel-
bourne suburban court) was a rather bad
one assault and battery on a wife, who pro-
duced the evidence of a black eye and sundry
bruises. Drink was responsible, so the
I\M., who didn t want to punish the woman
by sending the breadwinner to gaol, insisted
upon the guilty one taking the pledge for
six months. He was told to stand down
until after the rising of the court, then to
go to the clerk’s room and enter into the

wife took a constable aside. “Couldn’t he
go home first, sir?” she pleaded. “There’s
a bottle of beer in the house !” And that
John and I are still wondering whether it
was the pledge or the beer that the poor
soul didn’t want to waste.
“Scalpel”: Law-graduate John-o’-Henley
Lang, who for many years has taken a bee-
like interest in the social and sporting activi-
ties of Melbourne Uni., looks back on his years
of effort with disappointment. He wants to
see “a real interest taken by men-students in

the success of any University; but the Mel-
bourne shop is trying to serve a large com-
munity, crowding thirstily around the fount
of knowledge, with a quite inadequate supply
of drinking-utensils.
“D.F.” : It is likely that the very first use
of the word “Australia” in print occurs in a
note written by Hakluyt and published in
the 1610 edition of “Purchas, his I’ilgrimes.”
He speaks of “Australia del Espiritu
Santo,” probably a lucky slip for the "Aus-
trialia” which De Quiros coined for what
he thought was the great southern continent,
but was really a part of the New Hebrides.
“Terra Australis” occurs in a book published
three years earlier, a kind of “Gulliver’s
Travels,” written by Bishop Hall. In 1076
there appeared at Geneva a work entitled :
“Adventures of Jacques Sadeur in the Dis-
covery of the Terre Australe, containing the
Customs and Manners of the Austral ans.”
I can find no earlier use of this last word.
“C.S.G.”: Talk about luck ! An Aussie
in our battery had been transferred from
France to a staff job in England on his
mother’s petition, he being the sole surviving
son of five boys who had enlisted. A
few nights after he had been removed out
of danger he was killed by a bomb while
sheltering in a church in a quiet London
suburb.
They tell you this story at Stingweed.
When Torpy and Mrs. West were eloping,
driving in the grey morn down towards Dry-
ford. they were a little disconcerted to see
Sterling coming riding towards them. Sterl-
ing was a neighbor of West’s, and might be
expected to interfere with the flight. On
the impulse of the moment Torpy threw a
small tarpaulin over Mrs. West and drove
on. Of course Sterling drew up. and there
was an exchange of compliments, Sterling-
eyeing the tarpaulin curiously all the while.
“I bin all night on at the mines,” Sterling
explained. “Didn't expect to get back till
to-night. How’s everybody? Well, so
long. Gotter be goin’.” At noon it was
known all over Stingweed that Torpv had
run off with Mrs. West. Sterling went to
see West about it. “She’s gone with Torpy
all right. Henry,” he explained. ‘‘l met ’em
on the Dryford road.” West felt that Sterl-
ing’s conduct had been unneighborly. “Why
didn’t you turn ’em back?” he demanded.
Sterling scratched his chin. “Well, you
see,” he said. “Torpy had the woman hid
under a tarpaulin, and I didn’t know but
what it was my missus!”
“Mannamead”: When Beatty hauled his
flag down on Big Lizzie, terminating his
career afloat, lie said in his fare-
well to the ship’s company that he
was confident (he traditions of the
service would lie maintained. We
owe a lot to Jellicoe’s shrewdness
and Beatty’s dash, to Grant and
Dumaresq, to Try whitt and Keyes;
but few to whom their names are
familiar, outside the .Navy itself,
ever heard of the man to whom all
these owe their training It was
Admiral Sir Arthur Ivnyvet Wil-
son. \ .C., who, when hauling down
his flag in 1907. signalled the fleet:
“I hope you will continue your dis-
cipline to the last, and that there
will he no cheering when I go over
the side.” “Tug” Wilson, as the
Kavy called him, began his service
by fighting Arabs ashore with the
hilt of a broken sword, and ended
his 52 years’ afloat by doing what
no other admiral has ever done. Off
Lagos he handled 40 battleships in
intricate manoeuvres at 17 knots
(the highest speed of the slowest
ship), at two cables’ length apart,
for hour after hour. Had- one of
his signals been mistaken it would
have meant that the ships would
have piled one on top of each other
like cars in a railway smash. It
was a wonderful day’s work. “Tug”-
had immense courav.:, or he would
never have dared to handle seven
divisions in one as he did on that
occasion. He was no hanger-on to
place and power, either, and when
he went over the side for the last
time he refused a job at the Ad-
miralty because there was a retiring
age and he had reached it. The
King make him an Admiral of the
Fleet, although, it is. said the old
man argued with George over the rise.
“Biologist" : The likeness of the Digger to
the ancient Greeks, lately noticed in Lon-
don, was recorded years ago by this writer.
Put the men of the Elgin marbles in surf
costume and they would blend unnoticed in
our beach crowds. Aussies lack the over-
burden of beef retained by Britishers and
Maorilanders; at the same time, when the
limbs are long unclothed the bumpiness of
the muscles is rounded off. A typical surf-
bather might have stepped oIV a monument.
Very rarely is the girl in the same class:
usually more or less knock-kneed, her lower
limbs are too short and her body malformed
by wearing corsets. The Digger resemblance
to the Greek is not accidental; like condi-
tions have produced like results. The abo-
riginals of the south of Europe were a race
kin to the Berbers ; at some prehistoric time
Scandinavians arrived in Greece as immi-
grants and conquerors; and the climate, like
that of Australia, did for them what it is
doing for our own Northern blood. Inci-
dentally, migration often stimulates the men-
tality. By making slaves and workers of
the aboriginals the invaders gain leisure to
evolve a high civilisation. But the future is
always to the slave, the toiler, lie is pre-
potent; the non-physical worker, as a class
or a race, dwindles. In Greece, as later in
Rome, the slave absorbed the master, and
we have the Dago of to-day, the man of the
fish- and fruit-shop, the Berber nearly re-
vived. Fortunately, we have no aboriginals
to blend with and absorb us; and barring the
strange immigrant, the one great pure-white
race may evolve in due course to its ulti-
mate best. To the physical glory achieved
by the Digger should follow mental glory,
the men who smiled, at death putting up the
next world’s record of human attainment.
“Sarg's” solemn item from Syria:—
Times were very trying for Big Red Davis, of the
i lamels. All wine-shops were out of bounds and
diversion was well behind the skyline. Then the
Bishop of Jerusalem signified his willingness to con-
firm any Billjim who was worthy, and Red got an
itching that he ought to be there. Red’s Biblical
knowledge was strictly limited, so he approached the
padre with a view to “takin’ a course in religion,”
and the padre got to work. Red applied himself
assiduously to the task, and started off by removing
the stigma imposed on his hooshta bv its wicked
name, and rechristened it “The Saviour.” The padre
was fearfully shocked, and taught Red the meaning
of blasphemy. So the camel became plain “Corin-
thians.” Red wore a solemn air as he prepared for
the great event, and, being dissuaded from wearing
a eri*pe arm-band, he blackened bis boots. “A bloke
hasn’t got to be ‘larey’; it’s a dead serious turn-
out,” lie explained. The ceremony being a great deal
simpler than he thought, he got in flying. In his
eagerness to do the right thing, he asked the Bishop,
in a hoarse whisper, to “give him the oil w’en to
barrack. This so upset his Gaiters that he passed
Red through quick and lively, fearing he might be
subjected to other similar jolts. The military police
saw Red safely out of the city and he arrived back
to his unit bearing an expression totally out of
keeping with what was expected. On being ques-
tioned concerning the success of his outing, Red
broke out wrathfullv: “It was a—— have! I’d
like to know ’oo reckoned y’h had ter drink wine!”
Red had confused confirmation with communion.
THE SAFETY VALVE.
THE REV. : “My dear, that is no bird for a
clergyman's house; his language is
something awful."
THE GIRL .: "On the contrary. I should think
a clergyman's house just the place for
him."

HOW TO STOP PAIN IN STOMACH.
THE VALUE OF MAGNESIA AND
HOT WATER.
Generations of people have employed hot
water as a soother of pain in the stomach,
hut modern physicians and specialists have
discovered and used successfully an addition
which renders the hot water trebly efficaci-
ous. Hot water is still recommended in all
cases of stomach pain, from whatever cause
arising, but still better results are obtained
if a little hisurated magnesia is added. Hot
water attracts blood to the painful part and
the hisurated magnesia neutralises the acid,
which is usually the underlying cause of the
pain. That is why such excellent results
follow combination of the two. Readers who
are subject to pain in the stomach, especially
after eating, should try this hot water and
magnesia recipe. It renders dieting quite
unnecessary, for by slowly drinking half a
glassful of hot water containing half a tea-
spoonful of hisurated magnesia immediately
after meals, the dangerous stomach acids are
destroyed, and food remains bland and sweet
until perfectly digested. The hisurated mag-
nesia. which is extensively used in hospitals,
can readily be obtained from chemists every-
where ; but to avoid confusion with the
acetates, citrates and oxides of magnesia or
equally unsuitable mixtures of bismith and
magnesia, it is important that hisurated
should' be asked for very distinctly.—-Advt.

“L.”: Anyone know how to prevent a
pipe from burning and cracking? Have tried soak-
ing the bowl in whisky, smoking a new pipe out of
the wind, but mire all go the same way after having
been used a few times.
* * * *
“Melos” : Binghi, when he has a headache,
employs pressure to relieve the pain. Stretching
himself on the ground he invites a heavy-weight
confederate to stand on the offending cranium. If
this does not have the desired effect Coolem says:
“Little pfella bit more heavy,” and the poundage
is increased. Pain in other parts of the body is
often treated in the same way, and also by the
application of heated stones.
“Six-and-Eight”: Before I adopted the
nefarious profession of the law as a means of getting
a poor but dishonest livelihood, I tried leading the
chain for a N. S. Wales Government surveyor. When
Theodolite shifted his camp into the wild country
near the head of the Tuglow, he found some diversion
in naming the parishes he surveyed. Kangaroo,
lvonangaroo and Wallaroo found him at the end of
names with the ending “roo,” till a flash of genius
inspired him to call the next parish Bummaroo. In
the camp the betting was guineas to gooseberries the
name would be rejected by the departmental heads.
But it passed, and now in the land district of Lith-
gow the parish of Bummaroo exists. When I last
saw it there was much available vacant Crown land,
rocky and rabbit-infested enough to make it suitable
to be set apart as holdings for returned soldiers,
“E.S.S.”: A travelling bird-school in
charge of a lecturing naturalist is required in this
country, to ' spread a knowledge of bird uses and
habits among agriculturists, orchardists, graziers
and the small boy. The orchardist usually looks
suspiciously on birds he finds about his fruit-trees,
and either shoos them off or shoots them. Yet
most of the feathered hunters are there to rid him
of caterpillars, scale, fruit-flies, moths, bugs and
beetles. Others, in situations where their native
bush has been cleared away, go there to nest. Some
of them knock off a little fruit, and a few mingle
fruit with their insect diet. But the damage is
insignificant compared with the good policing work
they are doing all the year round.
“Hermisb”: The Bolshevik germ has even
spread to brother Binghi. In the half-yearly report
of the Methodist Mission to the Goulburn Islands it
is noted that “one of the anarchist-abos., Jimmy,
has proved himself a first-class agitator and red-
ragger.... He is an aboriginal 1.W.W., and his
removal greatly conduced to peace and harmony, and
consequent good work.” However, James is appa-
rently not done with yet, for the superintendent
“regrets exceedingly to report that in spite of efforts
made in Darwin, Jimmy escaped surveillance, and
is now working his way up to this island with the
avowed intention of getting even with Ada and
Charlie, who gave evidence resulting in a term for
him at Fanny Bay.” So the brotherhood of the Bloody
Flag have the satisfaction of knowing that their
precepts have spread even to the islets of Northern
Australia.
“S. S. Severn” : I was running a dysentery
camp six weeks from anywhere. Mr. Patrol-Officer
K. had just dropped in to see if I wanted anything
and if the orderlies were behaving, and whether the
boys were giving any bother. He had walked 10
miles up the mountains to do it. Which is just
the kindly sort of thing white men in the Papuan
service do. Laria, my little Courabada boy, brought
in the tea beautifully. I noticed that Mr. Patrol-
Officer gave him a decided look, and said loudly,
A HOLIDAY QUESTION FOR SPORTSMEN.
THE DYING BEAR: “I am a good Australian. What arc you?”
“I may be over again any day.” Before he came
Laria had finished his time, and I had signed him off
and sent him back to Moresby. I was sorry to lose
Laria, he w’as the best boy I ever had. But he had
begun to fret and used to sit on the hospital steps
and howl dirges in D minor. When Mr. Patrol-
Officer came I asked, “Why did you look at Laria
like that?” “Well,” he said, “last time I came
across him he w’as sawing a man’s head off with a
bamboo-knife.” When I returned to Moresby,
months later, a smiling Laria came to call. “Laria,”
I said sternly, “true you been killum man?” He
seemed pleased. “Oh, yes, Sinabada,” he beamed,
“that fashion belonga me. I been killum flenty!”
* * * *
“Avis”: I was admiring the way half a
dozen grey cuckoo-shrikes w’ere foraging out the
fat caterpillars that burrow into the tips of the
ripening corncobs, when bang! bang! went the
cocky’s gun and away flew all that were left alive
of the beautiful little workers. Wonder why the
man on the land is so keen on the destruction of his
best friends. These birds are genuine caterpillar-
eaters, their bills, long and sharp, being splendidly
adapted for extracting the juicy morsel from its
hiding-place in the cob. Leach saj’s, “We should
afford this family all the protection possible,’’ but
the farmer reckons he knows more than Providence,
to say nothing of Leach.
“Wealsman”: The remarkably early age
at which wild ducklings take cover on the approach
of danger, as interestingly noted by “E.S.S.” (B.
20/3/T9), has misled many observers, including
noted Darwinians, into the belief that fear in
animals is hereditarily transmitted, like form and
color and web-feet. But closer and keener observa-
tion by later scientists has almost wholly upset the
ancient theory. Dr. Chalmers Mitchell, of London
Zoo, found that the small animals which are usually
fed to the snakes in the Zoo “showed no special
dread of snakes nor the slightest instinctive fear or
foreknowledge of their approaching doom.” Rats and
guinea-pigs ran and clambered about among the ser-
pents ; and dogs, foxes, wolves, sheep, antelopes and
donkeys were either quite indifferent or “came up to
the bars and sniffed,” and on finding the snake was
not something to eat, “moved away with an air of
wearied disgust.” Benjamin Kidd, searching for evi-
dence in support of the theory that social heredity and
not individual or inborn heredity is the mainspring
of human civilisation, found that practically the only
knowledge of any kind possessed by the very young
of wild birds and mammals was that which had been
imparted to them by their parents, generally under
conditions of strong emotion. He made many experi-
ments among wild ducks in British marshes:—
I came on a nest of the wild duck in a marsh as
the young birds had just emerged from the eggs.
The mother duck flew off and disappeared in the
sedge, flapping a wing to which she pretended injury.
I stood bv the nest for some hours and watched the
young birds. The greater number were already
active and displaying an interest in their surround-
ings. They began to try to get out of the nest, and
I took them one by one in my hand and placed them
in the water, where in the stillness that reigned they
splashed and twittered and enjoyed themselves. They
showed not the slightest fear of me, nestling from
time to time at my feet and turning intelligent eyes
upwards to look at me, evidently quite ready to accept
me in the fullest confidence as their guardian....
After a time I moved away some distance to watch
what would happen. The mother-bird returned and
alighted near by. The little ducks rushed towards
her as she called. I could observe her. She was
chattering with emotion. Every feather was quiver-
ing with excitement. The Great Terror of Man was
upon her. After a short interval I advanced towards
the group again. The mother-bird flew’ away with a
series of loud warning quacks. The little ones scat-
tered to cover, flapping their short wing stumps, and
with beaks wide open cheeping in terror. With
difficulty I found one of them again in hiding. It
was now’ a wild, transformed creature trembling in
panic which could not be subdued.
According to Kidd, who made numerous other experi-
ments, the little ducks, “hatched out from eggs taken
from the nest, or taken themselves from the nest the
first day after hatching, knew’ nothing of any fear
of man, and they never acquired it afterwards if
brought up with domestic birds.” This gives the
mother-duck only one day to instruct her kinder-
garten that Man is a Bad Lot, but the time is evi-
dently sufficient. The black-duck school placed under
observation by “E.S.S.” does not appear to have
kicked serious holes in the argument, for the duck-
lings had apparently been away from the nest for
some hours. But one feels that “E.S.S.’s” other
little friend, the scrub-turkey chick, ought to be in-
troduced to Benjamin Kidd at the earliest oppor-
tunity. I wonder where the turkey-chick picks up
his “social inheritance”? Has he a foster-Moses of
any kind to meet him with a decalogue on his
Sinai? How else, barring inborn instinct, does the
motherless baby-bustard learn the camouflage value of
a leaf-shadow or a buffalo-chip? Isn’t there a Dad
somewhere about the young turk’s Natural Selection
to advise little Johnny how to dodge bushrangers? I
hope “E.S.S.” or some other Aboriginator will clear
the matter up.

“D.F.”: The term “gum-tree” for the
eucalvpts was probably invented by Sir Joseph
Banks. It seems to have been first used in an
account of the exploration of the Queensland coast
during Cook’s voyage of 1770, in which it is
remarked that the “gum-trees” seen were similar
to those farther to the south.
* * # *
“Azac”: “Jaymae” (B. 3/4/T9) states
that he recently searched through
various lists of useful Australian tim-
bers but failed to find a mention of
cypress pine. He searched with his
eyes shut. Let him refer to J. H.
Maiden’s work, “Some of the Princi-
pal Commercial Trees of N.5.W.,”
which forms part 11. of the N.S.W.
Forestry Handbook. In this hook a
chapter is devoted to “The Cypress
Pines of N. S. Wales,” and a very
concise and instructive description is
given of each. species. There are
about eight species “.lav-
mac” says, “being white-ant resistant,
this pine can he used in any locality
for building purposes,” which state-
ment the Government botanist quali-
fies by agreeing that the timber has
great powers of resistance to insect
pests, but the assertion that it is
absolutely white-ant resistant is, in
his opinion, “overstating the case.”
“Messrs. Sulman and Power, archi-
tects, in 1893,” he says, “showed me
a piece of cypress pine that had been
undoubtedly attacked by white ants,”
and he goes on to give other in-
stances. Not only is the timber of
the cypress pine useful as a building
material, but Baker and Smith some
time ago drew attention to the astrin-
gent properties of the bark and
endeavored to get it used for tanning.
Previous to that it was rejected as
useless. Then, again, there is the
resin of the cypress pine—Australian
sandarac—which no one seems to take
(he trouble to collect, mainly through
ignorance of it's value. We import
from Algeria, through London, all the
sandarac required. “The collection of
tustralian sandarac,” says J. H.
Maiden, “is one of those industries
that could be undertaken by a family
of children.”
* * *
“Murkali”: Sufferers from
malaria might give this a trial. It is
recommended by Dr. Joseph Levi, of
Colon, Isthmus of Panama, who has
had a heap of experience of the dis-
ease. Get icef salt, vinegar, lime-
juice, a little water and bay-rum.
The entire body should be sponged with
it every few minutes in had cases. The
doc. says he has used it again and
again, with undoubted success. He
got the recipe from an old West
Indian nana, or nurse, who had served in tropical
hospitals and sick rooms for donkeys’ years.
* * * #
“Bung”: Near Bega (N.S.W.) lately a
dairy-farmer was moved to tears to find one of his
goddesses 18 feet above the ground in the fork of
a tree. She had been stranded there while voyaging
down the flooded river. The tree was hastily guyed
with block and tackle and her ladyship reverently
lowered. She was then carefully escorted back to
the milking chapel and a thanksgiving service held.
* * * «
“Senex”: I want to introduce the David-
sonian plum to the notice of the congregation, with
a view to its transplantation to Hades as a shade
tree. It’s not very big—trunk about Gin. diameter —
but it has a large palm-like head of plume-shaped
leaves. It grows prolifically in the scrub, and
is, I believe, indigenous to the Atherton district
(N.Q.). Its fruit is about as big as a hen-egg, and
grows six or eight together on a long 6talk, mango
fashion. It is a rich dark blue in color, with
purple flesh and four small seeds in it. It is very
sour, but makes a palatable and beautifully colored
jelly. The tree has a tap-root about 10ft. long,
and fire won’t kill it. Chop your scrub down, burn
off, and next day the Davidsonias in your clearing
will all have a green shoot. Like hope, they spring
eternal.

Here is that Power Spray Outfit you have been wanting!
m fwcpe%> PERFECT BALANCE Spray Plant
IF you had built it yourself, it could not come nearer your ideas of construction. It has n/me of the faults you have found
in other outfits, and contains every feature you would consider essential for a perfect plmit.
Practical from start to finish—equally as safe on hillside as on
level ground—will turn around in its own length—full or
empty no weight on horse !
THE LOW-DOWN, UNDER-SLUNG VAT makes it just as safe on the hillside as on
level ground. Whether full or empty this outfit is balanced just right to prevent undue
burden on the horse, and on
account of its low-down con-
struction it is specially adapted
to work hillside vineyards or
orchards.
WHEELS are wrought steel, 42in. high, with broad 6in. tyres, which insure light
pulling in soft soil.
PUMP is the famous vertical Duplex type, which works at any angle.
ENGINE is the Cooper Low-speed type, fitted with quick-start, oscillating magneto,
speed regulator, etc.
VAT holds 100 gallons, and is made of best New Zealand Kauri.
AGITATOR revolves on the axle, and is mechanically operated.
Special high-pressure hose and all fittings are included.
Spraying is not an experiment. It has long since been proved that the spraying
of orchard, vineyard or garden increases the yield from 25% to 50%, and secures
95% “perfects” as against 25% to 30% when not sprayed.
If you have spraying to do, make it your business to learn more about the Cooper
“Perfect-Balance” Spray Plant. Write to-day.

“Xosa”: I had several years’ experience
in a mounted regiment in the native territories of
S'Africa, where storms are numerous, and it was con-
sidered very dangerous to ride hard if one was form-
ing. The general opinion was that a heated horse
attracted the c’lectric fluid, though there was many a
more heated camp-fire argument on the point. The
two ideas with most backers were: (I) Heat, rising
from the horse in the humid atmosphere caused a
current which attracted the fluid; (2) a horse when
heated generated a certain amount of electricity
which attracted the fluid. I know personally of three
cases where the rider, trying hard to make camp, was.
caught iri a storm and on each occasion the prad was
killed while the man got off with a severe shock.
Gne rider I knew thought discretion was the better
part of valor and dismounted. He had put only a
few yards between himself and the horse when the
nag was killed.
A DONATION.
THE REV. MEEKS: “ Could you spare me
something, Mrs. McGlue?—I am collect-
ing for our new Drunkards' Ref age.”
MRS. McGLUE: “Me old man w on’t be home
before six.”
“Almanac”: Is this a new,industry? On
the Murray, 16 miles from Albiirv (N.S.W.), lives
a Chinese market-gardener whose spare time is spent
trapping crows. After plucking, he disembowels
them. The head is then split Open and the brains
taken out ; also the tongue. Strung through the
head on wire the birds are then sundried. Asked
“Whaffor?” he said: “Me takem to Albuly; ray
countlymen give one chillin each. Likein betteren
chook. Keepem six mums—l 2 nnims-—alleesame.”
He assured me that the specimens I saw had been
hanging for five months. I believed him.
SOMETHING SOLID.
KIND LADY: " What you poor people need is a little more sympathy to lighten your
burden.”
WHALER: "What I need, lady, is a loaf of bread an’ a chunk of cold mutton to make it
a bit ’eavier.”
“A.G.C.”: On what is known as Sail Rock,
Garden' Island, Cardwell (N.Q.), a pair of white-
headed eagles or fish-hawks have for many years past
reared their brood. Around the ever-enlarging nest
the scraps of decaying fish attract innumerable flies.
Doing their best to keep them down, however, are
scores of small lizards of the variety usually found
about a house. How they got there is a mystery, for
fully 50 yards of water separates the rock from the
island. Possibly birds carried tile first pair thither
on sticks when building their nest.

“Obadiali Ren” : Old Mike Ilogan was one
of the biggest farmers in the district,
but there was no stinking pride about
him on that account. His pet aver-
sion was to be called Mister Hogan.
“The good ould Oirish name uv Mike
is good enough for me,” he would
say. “Mike Hogan, be the divil’s
body!” Recently the local Red Cross
committee decided to hold a fair, and
Hogan’s barn was chosen as the place
of festivity. On the afternoon of
the event old Mike was very much in
evidence, but his patience was steadily
giving way under a fire of “Mister
Hogans,” and he was very near the
exploding point when the time for the
opening of the fair came, and with it
the bank-manager’s wife, who was to
start the proceedings. As she sailed
in at tiie door (amid much clapping
of hands and stamping of feet) she
almost ran into Mike. “My dear Mr.
Hogan,” she began. “For the luv o’
God’s mercy,” yelled Hogan, “call me
Mike, or shut your mouth.”
“Dale”: Two years after they took Bob
away,to the asylum he came back to the shed again.
The boys were glad to see him, but were a little
surprised when he told them that (a) he had
been crowned King of England, as it had been
discovered that he was a descendant of Cromwell on
the maternal side, and (b) he was a germ come to
spread the Bathurst-burr on the bosom of the Darl-
ing. Bob had been a good shearer in his prime,
but he seemed to have lost his punch, so they gave
him a job as off-sider to the cook. He was annoyed
at this, and a few days later introduced a bar of
iron to the intestines of the oil engine. He then
fled, in his shirt, for the scrub. McDonald,'’who
Was doing the expelling for thelshed, shook his head
and spat. “I don’t think Bob’s quite'right yet,”
lie said, thoughtfully. “1 don’t reckon they ought
to have let him out for a few'more weeks!”
“Gold Stripe”: Here where I am (4th
A.G.H.) the Diggers call rabbit “underground
mutton.”
“U.P.” : When a dam at Southern Brook
(W.A.) was being cleaned oat lately hundreds of fish
were found —carp, golden and common. No fish had
been knowingly placed there, so they must have been
carried from the Avon River by black shags and per-
haps pelicans, which are sometimes seen in the local-
ity, and the spawn has hatched. About 500 fish were
shifted from the muddy bottom to another dam,
where they will be given a chance to multiply.
“Joyce”: I have a chinamon-and-yellow
hen-canary that is a champion warbler. 1 had been
watching her for some time filling out her throat and
trying to sing whenever the male birds struck up, ai.d
at last she succeeded. The notes are not quire as
shrill, nor the song so long,, as a gentleman canary s,
but the effort- is a very fine imitation. There is" no
doubt about her sex, because she hatched four young-
ster* last season.
* * * *
“Riverina”: The scheme for destroying
rabbits by gelignite reminds me of a
Maoriland cocky’s experience. An-
noyed daily by a poultry-loving hawk,
he eventually trapped the thief and
planned an ornate revenge. A supply
of “geli” was attached to the
wretched bird’s leg, a long fuse fixed
and lighted, and Turnips waited for
the doomed hawk to sail up and pro-
vide the fireworks. His gloat did not
eventuate. Dazed by the rough hand-
ling, the bird refused to budge from
the humpy door. Perspiration stood
out on the paralysed man's forehead
as he shooed frantically. At last the
feathered mine rose to the roof, near
the chimney. Supplication and blas-
phemy failed to move him, and there
he sat till the end came. The chim-
ney and roof went up splendidly,
while the cocky, fleeing over the land-
scape, swore off fancy methods of pest
destruction for all time. Still, the
proceedings were fatal to the hawk.
“Eddyson” : The mare having given hints
of approaching collapse, we sought the only promise
of refuge in a desolate landscape. The one visible
residence was a rough, two-roomed slab humpy with
a sod-and-shjngle chimney large enough to count as
a third room. As we drove towards the place, 1
saw an old woman c-ome out, and retreat hastily,
closing the door after her. However, we were not
inhospitably received by the same little, alert, old
woman, but her silent, sullen husband never left his
seat in the . huge chimney, where he cowered over a
scrap of fire during the whole of the time we re-
mained indoors. There were evidences of a hasty
clean-up in the kitchen-living-room, but the clay
floor was stained with dark, wet patches, and on the
table lay a large butcher’s knife, blade and haft
thickly blood-stained. This 1 saw the old woman
snatch up and hide in her apron ; hut my impres-
sion was that she was ashamed of having so unsightly
an article among the food. We were offered tea
and breakfast, for a consideration, and after feeding
the roan and the grey turned them loose in Carr’s
land. The old woman was a tremendous chatter-
box, and while Tommy sat and smoked 1 gave atten-
tion to details of the room. In one corner furthest
from the fire was a small pile of something covered
with hessian ; it provoked concern, if only for the
reason that when I dropped the harness on it it
sagged down, drawing the covering a little back,
and I saw a small black pool that looked horribly
like blood. At breakfast-time the pile in the corner
was gone, and the stains on the clay floor had been
dusted over with ashes ; but old-man Carr was back
in the fireplace, much as if he had never moved
from it, silent as before. We had travelled perhaps
five miles from Carr’s when Tommy spoke. “When
I went after Bobby this morning,” *aid he, “his
hoof went down in a soft patch in that corner behind
the furze. It was a hole that had been dug over-
night and filled in.” “What do you make of that?”
said J. “Well, 1 dunno, but 1 noticed when har-
nessing the grey that his fetlock was stained.” “That
doesn’t count for much.” “They were bloodstains,”
said Tommy. It was at Three Hills that we first
• heard of the murder at Stony Hiclges. Craven, the
mounted policeman, interviewed Tommy on hearing
that we had put the night in at Carr’s. “You’ve
come through the Ridges,” he said. “Did you hap-
pen to hit on anything at all suspicious? The mur-
dered man’s name is Johns. lie was a bark-stripper,
working for Carr.” Then it all came out. 1 knew
we had spent the evening at Carr’s in company with
the mutilated body of Johns. 1 knew, too, what
dreadful thing was hastily hidden away under the
hessian. Tommy told of the new-made grave among
the furze, and the stains of blood on the fetlock of
the grey horse. “You’d better stand over a day or
two at Three Hills,” said Craven. We saw the
constable bring Carr in, and the old man glowered
upon us with ferocious hate. “It’s all right,” said
Craven, “and I'm much obliged. I’ve got the buried
offal, the carcase and the skin, and that’ll fix him.
He wasn’t content to kill for his own meat, he has
been selling his mutton all over the place a year or
more.” “Why,” gasped Tommy, “‘what’s the charge?”
“Sheep-stealing,” replied the constable. “But what
about Johns', the fellow that was murdered?” “Oh,”
said Craven, “I invented Johns ; people simply won't
help to put a man away for a little thing like sheep-
stealing.”
* « • *
“Adelaide”: A controversy rages in Adel-
aide about the African boxthorn. Some declare it to
be an intolerable pest; others say that it is simply
invaluable as a breakwind. The leader of the anti
party is Captain S. A. White, the authority on bird-
life. He declares that birds carry the seeds till all
surrounding country is made useless, and that the
S. Aus. Act of last session, which allows hedge or
Imakwind, though forbidding all isolated plants, is
a laughing-plot. The other side says that it would
be ruined, or thereabouts, if its hedges had to be
grubbed up. The truth seems to be that boxthorn
seeds come up freely only near the sea, and that
inland they are as harmless as the priekly-pear has
proved itself in S. Aus. The compromise established
by the new Act seems likely to stand.
* * * *
“W.A.C.”: Couldn’t understand the curt
refusals to my requests for employment up country
until an old bagman slung the hint. “Put a bit
more condition on that cigarette-swag of yours,” he
said. “A cocky judges a bloke’s ability by the size
of his bluey.” My imitation of Atlas, sagging under
a capacious swag that 1 d ftuffed with grass, did the
trick at the next Wire Whiskers’ place I called at.
THE PESSIMIST.
“Now I bet the first thing sergeant says to
[?] is 'Oo give you permission to fall
out?'"
“J.’U .A. 8.": I met liim the other day
near agga (N.S.W.). He was easily Bft. or 9ft.
long, dark brown, with a distension of about 4in. in
diameter just behind the head, and he had orange
markings on his underneath. He put up a very
stiff fight, too, attacking first, and narrowly missed
killing my horse twice. When I was able to land
him one with the stockwhip he turned tail and dis-
appeared into the scrub. Now what snake family
did he belong to?
THE HORSEMAN’S GRAVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Within this quiet country grave
There sleeps the dust of one long dead ;
Above him leaves and grasses wave
And trees their shifting shadows shed.
He died so many years ago
That no man knows the day or year;
All that they say, and all they know,
Is that a horseman slumbers here.
A stone there is, but carved thereon
No name, no date the traveller l eads;
Perchance ’twas thought oblivion
Would best befit him and his deeds.
Perchance, soul-weary to the end,
And sick with pain and dark distress,
.He craved alike from foe and friend
The mercy of forgetfulness. •
Yet, musing o’er his hidden dust—
Grey dust of one unknown to me—•
I do not think it right and just
That he should so forgotten be.
Though none I question can reveal
The man he was, his heart, liis will,
I, trusting human nature, feel
The good lie did outweighed the ill.
Perchance by stealth, in ways untold,
He did his best, though weak and blind:
Ah, less than this 1 cannot hold,
And keep my faith in humankind.
Too old, too poor for sighs and tears,
Beneath the all-embracing skies,
Unknown, undaunted through the years,
The’grave of this dead horseman lies.
Unmarked save for the line that saith,
“Betwixt the saddle and the ground”—«
Behold the manner of his death—
“He mercy sought, and mercy found!”

Four users speak, on four
great features of the Type Z
FairbanKs-Morse Fngine
!
i
m<v
■ ■
• ’"Vi,;;
Why this engine leads the
field for all farm work.
THE TYPE “55” FAIRBANKS-MORSE is the only engine that
uses kerosene without unduly fouling the valves and plugs. It is
an easy engine for the farmer all the way! Starts easy, runsi
easy, easy on fuel and easy to buy.
Has a, Bl lIjT-INIIjT-IN MAGNETO and Throttling Governor. Water-
Cooling Hopper is compact and ensures efficient cooling. Runs
on kerosene or benzine. Portable and Stationary Types in
15, 3, IS, 10 and 15 b.b.p., with always some extra power.
HERE you have hard facts from men who have tried the
Type Z Fairbanks=Morse under strenuous conditions
and found it more than good. It is the greatest
engine investment for any farmer or engine=user because it
gives continuous cheap power without jibbing.
SIMPLICITY. —Mr. F. D. McMASTER, DALKEITH, N.S.W., says: “The Fairbanks-
-Morse Engine is simplicity itself.”
EASY STARTING Mr. W. R. MOORE, MOORABIE, Walgett, N.S.W., says: “I have
just completed a run of four weeks’ shearing with a 6-h.p. Fairbanks-Morse Type Z
and never lost a blow through engine trouble; nor did it refuse to start after the
first few turns on the coldest morning.”
RELIABILITY. —Messrs. BINDLEY WALKER & CO. LTD., SYDNEY, say: “We
have ten (10) of your Fairbanks-Morse Type Z Engines in use, driving our Wheat
Elevators at the various depots throughout the State. These Engines are in almost
daily use, some of them since January, 1918, and we have found them thoroughly
reliable and economical on fuel. Our gangs have elevated about 5,000,000 bushels
since January, 1918. We have tried other makes of engines, and replaced most of
them with the Type Z Fairbanks-Morse, which shows that we think the engine is
thoroughly satisfactory.”
ECONOMY. —Ml*. FERGUS LEONARD, COMBANING SIDING, via TEMORA,
N.S.W., says:—“The engine works on kerosene and is very economical. We used

does bare justice to the Dutch. Their
colonial administration, he says, is “still dis-
tinguished by three special features: (1)
that the colonies are primarily administered
for the benefit of Dutchmen; (2) that the
revenues which they produce go to swell
those of the mother country; (3) that
equality between white men and the natives
is an inadmissible proposition.” Dutch
colonial administration, which for all practi-
cal purposes means the administration of the
East Indies, is really based on bluff. And
almost necessarily so. How else could this
mere handful of people hold authority over
the 35 millions or so of Java alone? They
simply have to pretend that they are a
people apart. And one must admire the
thoroughness with which they carry out
their bluff. Lately influenza ravaged the
East Indies. Tens of thousands of the
Javanese died. The small white population
carried on as if nothing was happening that
could possibly affect them.
Britain found herself slowly. The British
East India Co. was just as much out after
profit as the Dutch East India Co. But, un-
questionably, Britain had a conscience. “We
affirm,” said Burke, impeaching Warren
Hastings, “that in his relations to the people
of India he was bound to act according to
the largest and most generous construction
of their laws, rights, usages, institutions and
good customs.” "In 1818,” Professor Ram-
say Muir wrote in his “Expansion of
Europe”—“in 1818 Britain stood forth as the
sovereign ruler of India. The most impres-
sive thing about this astounding fabric of
power was.... the results which flowed
from it. It had begun in corruption and
oppression, but it had grown because it had
come to stand for justice, order and peace.”
Germany had done no colonisation worth
mentioning. It had attempted hardly any-
thing. Then, three-quarters of the way
through the nineteenth century, it dreamed
dreams of becoming a world-State; and what
other great nations had, it must have. They
had built. It could not wait to build, if
indeed it knew how; it must carve. And
carve it did. Clifford, Governor of the Gold
Coast, can speak with personal knowledge
only of what it did in Africa ; and what he
says rings with authority. 8o late as 389 G
a German decree was issued declaring the
admissible punishments—in their order,
“corporal chastisement, fines, imprisonment
with hard labor, imprisonment in chains,
death”:
The instructions contained in these decrees, while
they require that a record of the punishments in-
flicted should be kept and forwarded every quarter to
the Governor, are silent as to any form of trial being
a necessary preliminary, and make no provision for
evidence being taken and committed to writing. . . .
The “rope-end” so meticulously described was a whip
fashioned from three interwoven strands of stout
hempen rope. When Lome, the capital of Togoland,
was captured in August, 1914, these whips were
found forming an apparently essential part of the
furniture of all bungalows inhabited bv German
officials. In the stores of the Public Works Depart-
ment they were kept ready for issue in neatlv-trussed
bundles of 10.
Clifford asserts that at the date of the Ger-
man occupation of the territory of the
Herrero and Damara Hottentots, in South-
West Africa, the native population num-
bered upwards of 750,000. T«-day it is
about 200,000. He examines the war of ex-
termination which had this awful result, and
asks, reasonably enough, “if unspeakable
horrors and cruelties were perpetrated in
Belgium in the full sight of an outraged
civilisation, is it to be wondered at if the
doings of the Germans in the seclusion of
South-West Africa, when divorced utterly
from all restraining influences and from all
fear of eventual retaliation, beggai'ed the
worst of the enormities committed by the
Spaniards and the Portuguese in the early
years of the sixteenth century?”
The writer has very little to say about
rhe Pacific colonies. He has no personal
knowledge of them, and, anyway, he believes
that Australian influence will suffice to see
justice done in that quarter, whereas there
is little or no influence to get justice done
over the remote colonies of Africa. Whether
that be so or not, it is certain that the
same reasoning applies to both. Germany
has put itself out of court in the matter of
any claim to have control over any native
people.
Smuts’s League of Nations
The League of Nations, by Lieut.-General
Smuts, is a reminder that Jan Christian
Smuts is something of a writer as well as
a notable soldier and politician, His plan
of the League is about the best yet published
so far as it goes, and where it isn’t safe to
go his capacity for staying away is commend-
able. Among the questions the S. African
doesn’t raise are whether the members of the
Conference (or League Parliament) shall be
elected on a uniform franchise, or whether
each State will make its own franchise so
that the nominee peer from one place may
help to rule the democratic peasant from
another; whether the Council (or League
Ministry) shall be appointed in any parti-
cular way or have any particular powers;
and, above all t whether the League shall have
any army or navy of its own with which to
keep the peace among its members or against
outsiders. The last is a much-shirked ques-
tion. If a member of the League revolted,
its share of the composite force would desert
or turn its guns on its comrades, yet without
the composite force the League could do
nothing in time of commotion except sool its
constituents on each other. This would be
like the manner of the old Germanic Diet,
which was very dignified except when its
component parts chased it off the premises.
“Government with the consent of the gov-
erned is our formula,” says Jan Smuts; and
if the consent of his own conquered country,
also of Ireland, India, Korea, Egypt, Trip-
oli, etc., is hard to obtain, he adroitly
neglects to say what will be done about it.
And it is hard to say what else he could say.

He Knows his London
A Peliec.i’s Tale, Fifty Years of London-
and Elsewhere, by Frank M. Boyd, is a
chronicle of small beer —polite, evening-dress
beer—and pleasantly written in its small
way. It is calculated to fascinate well-to-
do gentlemen and ladies in their prime who
know London and love it.. The subjects
include newspapers—not the strenuous poli-
tical sort, but the society touch-and-go sort,
of which the Pelican, founded by the writer
of these chronicles, was a sample. Also
clubs, theatres, actors, actresses, bars,
supper-rooms, plays and peers—and peers
and peers. None of the anecdotes are very
fresh—except perhaps one which is a break
in the high-toned monotony. This is about
two murderers who hated each other so much
that to prevent unseemly recrimination and
breach of good manners on the scaffold a
third or neutral murderer was hanged be-
tween them. The name of the neutral
murderer isn’t mentioned out of politeness.
The story of the baccarat scandal in which
King then only a prince, figured,
is given, with the name of the alleged swind-
ler left out. The tale of the popular actor
who was boycotted for telling home truths
to a rowdy London audience and fled to Aus-
tralia appears; but George Anson’s name
is suppressed out of politeness. Boyd
describes the death of Tree, the actor, as the
visitation of the “Grim Reaper,” and deco-
rates his volume, in all good faith, with a
bitterly commonplace portrait of Victoria
standing alongside Albert “in the early ’six-
ties.” No more washerwomanly portrait
ever appeared. In his most indignant
moments he admits that Augustus Moore —
sometimes called Disgustus—wasn’t quite a
pleasant character; that he once saw Carlos
of Portugal the worse for liquor ; and that
the godlike bumptiousness of Oscar Wilde
got on his nerves. But the prevailing fea-
ture of the volume is courtesy—the kind that
moves one to take off his hat to a cow
because she is a lady, (Herbert Jenkins,
Ltd., London.)
The Inky Way
Just-dead Frank Maldon Robb’s Oxford
Press edition of Adam Lindsay Gordon
(1913) is in many respects the best yet
issued. In the introduction he overstressed
Gordon’s debt to Browning, but then Robb
was a whale on Browning, and could at a
pinch prove his influence upon “Bellerive.”
Robb was a B.A. and LL.B., and a good sort,
amongst other things.
“Skeleton” : Sydney D. T. got a cablegram
about the disturbance ip Paris at a demon-
stration to the memory of Jean Jaures, the
French Socialist who was assassinated at
the outbreak of war. As despatched the
message ran :
People hooted Clemenceau lauded Lenin Trotsky.
As it appeared it read:
The people hooted Clemenceau and Lauder, Lenin
and Trotsky.
Hoot, mon !
“Baarmutha”: The People, the official
organ of the Socialist Labor party of Aus-
tralia, is dead. It had a painful existence
of 21 years, 18 of them spent in Sydney;
before that it was put to bed at Newcastle,
where it was born in 1897, 11. E. Holland
and Tom Batho being its parents. Until
the infant was brought to Sydney the
S.L.P.’s mouthpiece in that city was the
Collectivist. Batho took charge on the
shift and hit hard and often ; The People
was soon quoted all over the world. Its
best period was at the time of publication
of the historical romances of Sue. Then
came the war, and the Censor sat heavily
on the little sheet, which became a monthly
under the guidance of J. O. .Moroney and
another. These “directors’’ changed the
policy and the thing flickered out. From the
ashes of The People arises The Revolu-
tionary Socialist, a monthly at 2d., edited
by Ernest E. Judd. But Judd isn’t Batho.
The Bulletin has a little brother— The
Bakara Bulletin —and a very likeable
youngster it is. It is a souvenir of the
voyage of the transport Bakara and of the
Diggers aboard. There are over 70 pages
of it, records, sketches, verses, photographs
and black-and-white drawings. An article on
“The Diggers’ Religion,” by Padre Syd
Buckley, attracts special attention. Sum-
ming-up he says:—
The Diggers’ religion is not procured from books,
nor The Book ; it is the product of home and friends,
of good and faithful women and men, of suffering
and gladness, of experience happy or dreadful, and
of thoughts upon all these. In short, it is life and
the living of it. It is the secret strength and ex-
planation of the men who are ready to die and of
the men who have died and yet live.
Which, of course, is true.
Reg S. Ellery : After stating that Gautier
has been wrongly labelled a decadent and
affirming—by quoting the titles of some of
Gautier’s works—that he was purely a
romantic, “Jean Sibi” (B. 10/4/T!)) asks:
“After all, what is a decadent?” Gautier
himself has supplied the definition:
The style of decadence is nothing else than art
arrived at that extreme point of maturity... .trans-
lating the subtle confidences of neurosis, the dying
confessions of passion grown depraved, and the
strange hallucinations of the obsession which is
turning to madness.... In opposition to the classic
style it admits of shading, and these shadows teem
and swarm with the larva: of superstition, the hag-
gard phantoms of insomnia, nocturnal terrors, re-
morse which starts and turns back at the slightest
noise, monstrous dreams stayed only by impotence,
obscure phantasies at which the daylight would stand
amazed, and all that the soul conceals of the dark,
the unformed and the vaguely horrible in its deepest
and further recesses. ,
I still believe, therefore, that the term deca-
dent characterises Gautier’s style; but, as
all art eriL ; m is chiefly a matter of
opinion, perhaps “Jean Sibi” does not agree.
In literary criticism the term can only be
applied to a work of art; and as it has in
this sphere no moral meaning, it is not
applied to the artist himself. Artists whose
works are decadent need not be (though
some are) “exquisite invalids” with no more
backbone than an amphioxus. It would
seem that “Jean Sibi” is a little hazy about
the meaning of the term “decadent” and is
afraid lest it shall he applied to Gautier in
its “Wesleyan significance”—which Heaven
forbid!

Queensland’s gold yield for the first quar-
ter of this year was 30,2430 z. (tine), worth
£128,405, £12.802 less than for the same
period last year. In March the Towers and
Gympie and Croydon and all the other fields
except Mt. Morgan contributed only 30720 z.
between them.
» * * *
The Cloncurr.v field (Q.) produced metals
worth £1,320,252 last year, but shareholders
got only £36,000 in divs. Hampden shelled
out £35,000, and the persevering little St.
Mungo paid a sixpenny. The large quantity
of rich customs ore treated by the three
smelters indicates that some of the gougers
did well.

Westralian Mines Department has ob-
tained a geological report on the Breakaway
gold find at the head of the Kurrawang
woodline. It states that the work done is
too small and the structure of the country
too much hidden by overburden to allow of
a definite opinion as to the future of the
field. So far the scattered occurrence of
“dabs” and their smallness has been rather
discouraging', but the length of the line of
reef and good appearance of the country
generally lends color to the local belief that
something good will yet be found. Mean-
while a number of prospecting parties are
searching. A few good erushings have been
extracted, but nothing worth the attentions
of a co. has yet been discovered.

New Commodore had better give up. For
years it has been trying to make money at
Meekatharra (W.A.), but beyond finding
employment for a certain number of men
and helping to provide a living for the
local pub and storekeepers and getting in
debt every now and then, it has done
nothing. Now, after jibbing at paying
calls, shareholders are told that reefs of very
erratic widths and values have been the
ruination of the co. As an inducement for
them to provide more funds the directors
state that a Government geologist will
shortly inspect the mine, and should his
report be favorable the State will be asked
to grant a subsidy. Whether the geologist's
report is favorable or not, there is little
hope of the venture paying.
* * # #
Mary Mac shareholders (W.A.) are easily
satisfied. At the half-yearlv meeting held I
in London it was claimed that the show
could be made to pay on an average crushing
value of 20s. per ton, and that within
4s. 4d. of the value of the ore could be ex-
tracted without eyanidation. Shareholders
were told that while there might be no need
to make any further calls, the directors con-
sidered that more capital should be sub-
scribed in order to provide against a
machinery breakdown or other contingency.
What a pity someone with inside knowledge
was not present at the meeting to tell the
other side of the story ! Unless shareholders
want to lose more money they had better put
padlocks on their pockets.
Edna May is expected to be out of ore
reserves in six months, and unless more are
opened up in the interim (which even local
optimists consider unlikely), operations, in-
cluding pumping, will cease. The Edna
pumps 45,000 to 50.000 gallons a day at a
cost of £l2OO a month. The Central raises
15,000 gallons a day at a cost of £4OO a
month, and is said to also drain the Con-
solidated down to 280 ft. Deeps has escaped
drowning by plastering itself with cement,
but if the Edna May stops pumping the
Mines Department will, it is thought, refuse
to allow men to work in the Deeps below
200 ft. There is likely to be something
doing in regard to the water question at
Westonia before very long.

The hearse is at the door of the Duke and
Main Leads Consols, Maryborough (Vic.).
Started in the early ’9o’s, the co. has been
working the block next to the English-
owned Duke Extended and the lower section
of the Main lead, a tributary of the Duke
gutter. The promoter was the late Jim
McCrorey, who knew everything worth know-
ing about alluvial mining. Altogether the co.
handled 144,451 fathoms for 108,llloz. gold.
The average value per fathom was £2 13s.
4d., of which costs took £2 10s. 9d. These
costs included everything (even plant) at the
mine and head-office charges. The actual
value of the gold won was £445,718. On
the face of things it would appear as if the
difference between costs and gold got was so
small that it was hardly worth while risking
so much money. A statement of calls seems
to carry the same conclusion. Thus 11,800
promoters’ shares had 14s. 7d. called up on
them; and 245. 7d. was called up on the
38,200 contribs. Against these payments
the mine yielded £1 14s. per share in divs.
Still, that is not the whole story, except to
the man who held on to stock from start to
finish. The mine was got going at a pretty
small cost, through the frugal use of plant
and good buying at a time when a lot of
second-hand stuff could be picked up cheaply.
Good dirt was run into almost at once, and
a long spell of monthly divs. followed. But
when the leading drives got away from the
Main lead junction, the people who had
bought in at high prices saw the run of gold
narrow and costs go up, with consequent
calls. At the finish the payable run of gold
was only 60ft. wide, which in a big gutter
cannot show profits unless it is superla-
tively rich. So it was the poverty of old
age that ate up the early savings. Altoge-
ther £517,000 represents the balance-sheet
total. Of that £61,458 was capital and the
balance gold and sundry receipts. The
money went in this way : ;
Mine Gant .. .. £16,402
Wages 281,438
Fuel, timber and supplies 101,000
Head office and fees .. 9,781
Royalties, taxes, etc. .. 15,009
Dividends 85,000
Cash .. .. .. 2,000
The four items in which labor is interested
represent, roughly. £400.000; but ’twas ever
so with alluvial mining.

PLANS
THE demand for Goodyear Tyres during the past
year has greatly exceeded the available stock to meet
the ordinary and everyday needs of motori.ts
throughout Australia, or indeed everywhere else.
The big reserves of stock, which as a rule ensure the
tyre user the immediate fulfilment of his requirements,
auickly dwindled to nothing as shipments became fewer
and finally ceased altogether. However much our need
for tyres, the successful prosecution of the war was as
much a responsibility for Goodyear as anyone else, and so
perforce we had to wait.
Our inability to supply, might reasonably have been
expected to result in a lessening of demand for Goodyear
Tyres, and to have prejudiced the goodwill of motorists
who of necessity had to equip their cars with one of the
many other makes.
The facts are to the contrary however, for Goodyear Tyres
are more in demand to day than ever before. Motorists
in common with everybody else have learned the
economy of wise spending, and insistently demand
Goodyear Tyre equipment because it guarantees them
economy of service.
Now, happily, the war is ended, and
the re-adjustment of conditions makes
available full stocks of Goodyear Tyres
of all sizes and types in millimetre
and inch measurements, both with
Beaded Edge and No-Hook Straight
Wall Construction.
Goodyear Post War Plans provide
for the distribution of stocks in every
part of Australasia, the broadening of
Goodyear Service, and the multipli-
cation of Service Stations in antici-
pation of your wants.
Goodyear Tyres can now be fitted to any make and size
of car —light runabout, heavy touring car, waggon or
truck. There are hundreds of Goodyear Service Stations
throughout Australia, and Goodyear Dealers every-
where.

Evidence of defendant to prove justifiable
assault in a Richmond (Vic.) police-coun
case: “She comes up to me, and says.
‘You’re lookin’ wlnit you are!’ Well, I
wasn’t goin’ to stand that!”
Eight officers and 288 other Diggers lost
their left arms in action, or as the result of
injuries, while 13 officers and 309 others
lost their right arms. In the official A.I.F.
figures no case is shown of a man losing bo.li
arms in action. Gunshot arm-wounds ac-
counted for the invaliding of 143 officers and
5275 men. One or more fingers were lost
by 350, and the total number of men dis-
charged on account of wounds to hands was
1724. These figures represent the “tickets”
issued up to the end of last year.
“Y.Z.” : I did not believe one-tenth of what
I had read about Hodge till I encountered
Courtland’s “pommy.” lie was standing on
a box, painting “Wet Paint” in various
places along Courtland’s board fence. "But,”
I expostulated, “the paint isn’t wet.” In
point of fact, John William Ilodge had not
started to daub the fence. “Her’ll be wet
this evenin’,” lie said, cunningly. By that
evening he had completed the fence, and, of
course, painted out his warnings of the
morning.
Three or four years ago Lincoln (M.L.)
Agricultural College distributed to a few
selected farmers in Canterbury district a
quantity of a new wheat known as Hunter’s
Improved. It was supposed to be prolific,
and it is living up to its reputation. This
season the following yields per acre are re-
ported : Suunyside Mental Hospital Farm,
90 bushels; J. Lowrie, 88; Murray’s, 80;
and Lincoln College itself, 71. At the busi-
ness of filling sacks the wheat seems to be
“improved” all right.
Versatility is demanded of a Tasmanian
Minister. There are so many toy depart-
ments to be split up among the portfolio-
holders that many of the latter become uni-
versal experts while in office. Jack Hayes,
for instance, is Minister for Lands, Works,
Agriculture, Qloser Settlement, Repatriation
and Soldiers’ Settlement; also Controller of
the State Hydro-Electric Works. The last
show alone lias been responsible for the ex-
penditure of between four and five millions
since the outbreak of war.
The usual item :—•
Three well-known British firms have combined,
Crosse and Blackwell, Ltd., having acquired con-
trolling interests in James Keiller and Son, Ltd.,
and E. Lazenby and Son, Ltd The leading in-
ducement to amalgamation is the fostering of their
export trade.
In other words, it is an absentee Pickle
Trust formed to keep us from getting cheap
pickles so long as it hasn't to meet local and
other competition, and to flood us with cheap
pickles when it becomes necessary to squash
an insufficiently protected local pickle-
making industry.
“Murkah” : The Bulletin’s story of the
sea captain who missed his friend outside
a 'pub and 42 years later asked him where
in he’d got to that night, reminds me.
The Kellys once halted two wayfarers on
the road. Swearing them to secrecy about
the meeting, the bushrangers let them go.
Twenty-five years later the two met again.
In the course of the yarn one started to tell
the crowd about the long-ago meeting. The
other was horrified. “Hush man!” said he.
“ Didn't we promise we'd never say a word
about it!”
“Peg-Leg” : The demolishers struck a curio
when pulling down the G.S.R. Co.’s old
building at Canterbury (N.S.W.). In a
small hole between two foundation-stones was
a solid lump of molasses. It had apparently
trickled into a crevice, eaten a niche for
itself, and then mixed with the rock it had
chewed away. When the engineer brought it
up it retained its old smell and sweetness.
It is over 50 years since the Sugar Co. occu-
pied the building; add a couple of years on
to that, and you get the approximate age of
the petrified syrup.
“The Lamb” (Colombo) : Our ship was
lying at Port Melbourne pier the other day.
We had all done our funny little quarantine
act and were at last safely separated from
the diseased shore folk. The captain had
refused to await certain mails, and ivas sign-
ing some papers preparatory to giving orders
to cast off, when a steward broke in with
“A Mr. Webster to see you, sir.” The skip-
per swung round, glared stonily at his shore
visitor, and barked, “Who the blazes let you
on board?” The genial autocrat displayed
a pretty gold badge and stood expectant.
But, in his blind ignorance, the boss mariner
refused to be impressed. It seems unbeliev-
able, • but he forthwith called the Naval
Guard and the visitor was escorted ashore.
“G.P.” : An invention has just come from
far-away Lahore, which will bring hope aud
comfort to the grey lives of our blind sol-
diers, enabling them to walk again “in that
new world which is the old” by opening up
the whole field of literature, instead of
patchy bits in Braille type. The invention,
called the optophone, has to do with the
metal selenium, which responds to light by
becoming more conductive when illuminated.
By translating light into electricity it en-
ables light to do certain things. The appli-
cation of the metal to the optophone will
enable blind people to read ordinary print by
ear. The instrument is worked by throw-
ing intermittent light of five different fre-
quencies on the type, and receiving the re-
flected light on a selenium tablet, which
transmits to a telephone a set of sounds
varying with the shape of the letters. Miss
Mary Jameson, of South Norwood, the first
blind person to acquire the art of reading
by ear, gave a successful demonstration by
reading correctly the passages selected for
her by the audience. Dr. Fournier d’Albe,
lecturer in physics at Lahore University, is
the inventor.

the: palace hotel,
PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
THE LEADING HOTEL OF PERTH,
Overlooking the Swan River.
JOHN T. GLOWREY, Proprietor.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Dry Shave”: The Australian manufac-
turer is beginning to realise that he will have
to advertise his wares so’s to let peopie
know what he does make, in spite of Wa It
and Co.; but he leaves it at that, as usual.
He has, owing to a shortage of shipping, a
ready sale for all he can turn out and is
mostly oversold. In consequence he can’t
see the use of starting to boost until he is
able to double his output. lie forgets that
while he is getting ready, putting in new
machinery, etc., the Yankee and the Jap are
also getting busy—only a bit quicker. Un-
less the Australian manufacturer gets down
to brass tacks very soon and sets out to turn
into a permanent asset the goodwill he lias
gained during the last few years, he will find
himself as-you-were, or worse.
* * * *
“Gypo”: One of our business-drummers
will take a lot of. beating; but he doesn’t
know everything. On his last list of orders
he wrote: “P.S. —See footnote on top.”
• * * *
“Simon”: For a long time now I’ve been
expecting some hair-restoring charlatan to
exploit the saving qualities of ordinary wash-
i ing soda, per medium of a six-ounce bottle,
at os. a time. A 65-year-old friend of mine
has been soda-making for the greater part of
his life, and beyond a somewhat bleached
apnearanee of hair and moustache there is
neither greyness nor baldness to indicate the
journey they’ve goue. lie tells me that
amongst soda-makers in the Cold Country
the preservative effects of the chemical are
well known.
. * * *
“Devil Fish” : The best-fixed lot of fisher-
men on the Vic. coast are those at Portsea,
just inside Port Phillip Heads. Instead of
going after the fish they wait till the fish
come to them. Very many of the scales that
come in through the Heads follow a channel
that runs close past the landing-place. A
look-out man on the cliff gives a signal when
he spots a school coming up channel, and
the fishermen run their nets out and gather
in the harvest. Sometimes one haul nets
100 scoops, each holding 601 b.
* * * *
“Leo Lear”: Farmers in S.W. Victoria,
on the rich volcanic belt round Koroit, are
having a record year. Potatoes were never
under £lO a ton during the time the bulk of
the crop was put on the market. The
average yield was 10 tons, or £lOO per acre.
In one case a grower dug £3OOO from 32
acres of dirt. Returns like this knock the
recognised values of land clean out. Nom-
inally this class of country stands at £lOO
per acre. But what a howl there would be
if it were bought for settlement at that
figure!
* * * #
“Yak”: William Webster, the apostle of
super-efficiency, might consider an idea
which, so far from being new and untried —-
his plea regarding aerial post—has been
worked for many years past in England. It
is merely the privilege of sending telegrams
to telephone numbers.
* * * •
“Wood”: Victoria has a timber famine,
or had until American stuff began to choke
the wharves, and prices have sky-rocketed
nearly out of sight. Yet according to the
official estimates there are 200.000 acres of
timber, 100,000 first-class and 100,000
second-class, with any old thing up to
5.000,000.000 superficial feet of timber,
within 60 miles of Melbourne, in the
country back of Narbethong and around the
headwaters of the Acheron and other tribu-
taries of the Goulburn. A lot of it is
class timber, like mountain ash, messmate
and stringy-bark. Farther back and away
up the Yarra valley beyond Warburton there
are thousands upon thousands of acres of the
finest beech or myrtle, and a few people are
waking up to the fact that red or figured
beech is about the finest furniture and orna-
mental timber in the world. Fortunately
there will not be as much of this fine stuff
left to rot away as seemed likely six months
a £o last summer’s fires saw to that by
burning up thousands of tons of it. And
a lot of what it didn’t actually burn isn’t fit
for much else now.
A PLAINT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"During the past year girls entered the
college, —— passed the examinations and —— were
placed in situations.’’— Any business college ad.
Dear Elsie, since you’ve sneaked my stool
And fill (with blots) the boss's ledger,
Does your fond love begin to cool
Now that I’m deck-hand on a dredger ?
The work is rough and cold and wet;
I wish you had this job, my pet.
The skipper, too, is beastly, rude —
He calls me “Algernon” and “Socks.”
The weather, engines, buckets, food
Whatever’s wrong, 1 bear the shocks;
And everything’s so unrefined,
At times ! fear I’ll lose my mind.
I met last leave old cashier Brown;
In the Domain ho dosses nightly ;
He says old Hardfist turned him down
And gave his job to Miss Golightlv.
Brown went in, hoping for a rise
There’s still a dazed look in his eyes.
And Smith the traveller, too, is gone.
Brown says he’s on the track out IV est ,
Ear from the bars where once he shone
He hums his tucker with the best.
The very boy who bought our fags
Now haunts the two-up schools in rags.
Maegregor works at chopping rocks,
While Jim is now a racecourse tout;
O’Hara’s lumping on the docks.
And Jones and Cook are down and out.
In fact, and spite of all the wowsers,
Fair woman’s gone and grabbed the trousers.
Then wed me, dear, and have your way ;
I’m more than fed up with the navy.
You go to business, draw the pay ;
I’ll stay at home and act the slavey.
Excuse this scrawl from your Jack Tar,
The dredge (/iic)’s rollinonthebar.

ll COUCH REMEDY #
It takes just one germ
to turn good health and happi-
ness into ill-health and misery.
Don’t let that one germ get
into your home. You can kill
it at the very first sign of a
sore throat, cough, cold, bron-
chitis or influenza, if you take
Chamberlain s Cough Remedy.
Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
ratal to young and old. The great danger in
:his disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
rain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
save suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
ime and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy w :h
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges ti e stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in tise for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
ana when this remedy is at hand all danger
ptay be avoided.
13e Firm.
When you ark for a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysentery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. “ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic* and
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
never fails to give immediate and permanent
relief.
A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

for all those who are anxious about the future

uneasiness, if not for actual alarm. At all
events, Professor Hearnshaw states his various
conclusions with conspicuous fairness and
honestly of purpose, and we hope that his
book will be studied with the care which
so thoughtful a work deserves.”

The coming of a Remanent < Ircliestra to
Melbourne was not furiously hastened by a
concert which the Lady Nurtlicote Trust
Fund supplied at the Town Hall last Satur-
day afternoon. The entertainment consisted
mainly of two works that, under the best of
conditions, would be interesting only to
professors and students of music, taught to
accept a “tone picture” at the composer’s
valuation. In such things as Liszt’s
“Tasso” and Borodin’s Symphony No. 2,
there is not much sustained eloquence of
sound to stir the soul of si public which
merely wants to feel an effect, nor many
moments when the composer promises more
than he performs. It is, easy to say on the
programme that one of the Liszt movements
is “intended to express Tasso, haughty and
sad, amid the fetes of unworthy Ferrara,”
but the trouble is to make the music suggest
that, or anything else, to the outstretched
public ear.. When the father-in-law of Hot-
spur, in Sliakspeare’s play, claims that be
can call spirits from the vasty deep, the
sceptical young warrior questions whether
the spirits will come when father-in-law calls.
Considered as a whole, Tasso is an inco-
herent symphonic poem, containing a few
passages more or less impressive, but none
that are positively delightful. If it has
the “atmosphere” of Tasso’s life and times —
well, the Orchestra missed it. Perhaps
Slapoffski’s forces were insufficiently numer-
ous, owing to the ’flu. The Symphony by
Borodin is Russian, and conductor Slap,
(who used his forefinger in lieu of the tradi-
tional baton) did his best to extract some
cold charms from its rhythms. There is a
suggestion in the oft-times noisy concord of
orchestral sounds, anyhow. It suggests the
wandering thoughts of a Bolshevik travelling
by rail and looking out of the carriage
window. Wagner’s overture to “Tann-
hauser” was an item that everybody could
understand ; likewise Schubert’s “The Shep-
herd on the Rock,” which does Schubert
proud. Miss Patti Russell sang the aria,
supported by a murmuring orchestra in
general and an anxious wood-wind instru-
mentalist in particular. The singer’s enun-
ciation had a dulled edge sometimes, and her
voice, like her physique, needs to fill out;
but the quality of the voice is fine, and there
is warmth in its sweetness. Unassuming
Miss Patti Russell was the success of the
concert. The next will happen on May 17.
At Melbourne Royal the foggy drama of

planations of why
Germany didn’t win
the war. Her “chain”
system of spying
into British Cabinet
secrets seems too
supremely silly for
words, yet if one can
be persuaded that the
Hun master-spirit of
intrigue took a job as
butler in Styan’s
household, and car-
ried on a mysterious
correspondence with
both Berlin and the
London Intelligence
Department whilst
buttling in his pan-
try, the discovery that
Muriel Starr is also
an employee of both
sides needn’t strike
anybody pink. If
Frank Harvey as the
boss British sleuth
were to turn out to
be the Kaiser in dis-
guise, and Atliolwood
as the Hun arch-plot-
ter were to drop dead
of over-reaching him-
self, the drama would
not be more artlessly
thrilling than it is.
The scene is laid
mostly in the “Reception Hall of the Ben-
nett Home,” and everybody, visitor or
resident, enters it from upstairs, or
through a side door. Everything is full
of surprises, including the construction of
the domicile, and the impressive sounds of
air raids, which appear to be under the
direction of the butler. The complications
of "Three Faces East” are in quaint con-
trast to the plain horrors of the curtain-
miser. “The Monkey’s Paw.” In this the
most moving sound is an eerie knocking
against a cottage door of a young man who
has presumably flown thither from the adja-
cent cemetery, bringing his funeral furniture
with him. “The Face at the Window” was
a hideous, obtrusive joke, but the Coffined
Corpse at the Door is the more awful for
being heard and not seen.
*
Fritz Hart founded his opera of “Pier-
rette” on the story of “Prunella,” concocted
some years ago by Granville Barker and
Laurence Ilousman, but the musical trans-
lation is not comparable in fancy or stage-
craft to the original story. The score is
sad with the cries of a creaky boot, or high
with the anguish of an unoiled dray-wlieel;
yet, certainly, there are serious people who
pretend to detect a new idiom and a new
Soul behind its vehemence and concentrated
displeasure. Old Uncle Ben, sung by Fred
Collier, suffered from his creator’s anxiety
to fill him with low-pitched epithets of a
soured and crusty nature. Aunt Jane
(Thelma Carter) was little better off, and
Pierrot (Balboni) was clearly in a state of
expectancy waiting for the aria that never
arrived. Moreover, the Italian sang in his
own language—a futile sort of tongue to
such characters as Luke and Jane, and
hardly appropriate for young Pierrette,
whom Nellie Leach made particularly charm-
ing, though the composer didn’t help her
much. Altogether “Pierrette,” staged at the
Princess’s last week, is a disappointment.

“Going Up” has
settled dow r n to
stay at Melbourne
Majesty’s. Love is
a great elevator at all
times; but “Going
Up” shows an affec-
tion that lifts Arthur
Frith over 18 cities,
seven rivers and in-
numerable square
miles of mountain
and plain. The stuff
ought to be bottled
and sold by the man-
agement.
Vera Pearce, as
Lady Frayle, is sell-
ing her best boy’s
soul for one hour of
youth, with the plainly-premeditated idea
of suppressing all possible clues to her
association with vaudeville and panto-
mime. She almost establishes her alibi,
but, with all her good intentions, she
needs something more than Lady Frayle
to prove that she is an actress. An
improbable butler in the Frayle house-
hold tries to maintain his dramatic stature
on a pinch of personality supplied by Bert
Clark. The restless Canon and the lady
who makes him her mash are played by Ken-
nedy Allen and Marie Le Varre. Marie is
almost deafening in everything but song, but
it is difficult to diagnose Kennedy’s Canon.
He might be considered a smooth bore if
his utterance were more plush-like, stilted
and stately. Ellis Holland, who inspires
Vera Pearce’s incredible ' compact with
Beelzebub (Claude Flemming), is least
dispiriting in his trousers and boots, but the
young man is always far from overwhelming.
Goodie Reeve, who gets permanent posses-
sion of his heart and hand, has a manner
that is discreet and wistful. Celia Ghiloni.
mother of six and scandalmonger in a large
way of business, wears the name of Mrs.
Grundy with every cattish faculty working
hard to deserve the alias. Thomas Sydney
footles behind a heavy moustache, and his
stage wife, Gwen Burrouglis, is never really
employed. “My Lady Frayle” is a Robert
Courtneidge show, but at Melbourne Tivoli
it is neither scened nor dressed on the satis-
fying Courtneidge plan.
Hoyt s (Melbourne) have the two cowboy
stars, Tom Mix and Bill Hart, this week.
Mix goes secret-servicing for Uncle Sam
and proves that indiscretion is the better
part of valor. Hart, still pursuing gloomy
revenges, becomes once more the under-
taker’s friend in the Far Western mShie,
"Riddle Gawne.” Enid Bennett is also on
again in “The Vamp,” which gives her
plenty of room to advertise her prettiness.

The Williamson “Goody Two Shoes” pan-
tomime moved on from Melbourne to
Adelaide; and that city, hungry for amuse-
ment, gave it a tremendous welcome, the
booking at the Royal being a record, or so
it is claimed. May de Sousa was not well
enough to make the journey, and Dorothy
Hastings, promoted from her smaller part,
made a very capable substitute ; in the same
way the absence of Maggie Dickinson gives
Lucy Sullivan a chance to prove the expert-
uess of her toes. Other people are much
as before. Stigant and Toby Claude have
the best of the spoken fun, and Fred Wal-
ton’s silent work is pantomime in its highest
form. Lighting and mechanical effects are
of the usual Williamson standard. At the
Majestic, Eve Kelland and baby elephant
are nearing the end of their season. The
lady can have an apology for being bracketed
with the animal; but delightful they both
are in their varied ways. At the Tivoli the
crowd fresh from Oakbank has been catered
for with “The Winning Ticket,” in which a
Melbourne Cup is merely one incident.
Tom Cannam and Maude Goldspink do good
humorous work in this play. The Oakbank
steeple itself,, with every jump shown, is a
main attraction on the screen at Wonder-
graph. . Gaby Deslys, feather head-dress

At Wellington (M.L.) the other day Wil-
liam I arker, a waterside worker, was handed
j months hard labor for distributing matter
advocating a “strike on the job.” The detec-
tive said the leaflets were found at the meat
works and in Christchurch, and he didn’t
know whether they had been distributed
further afield. “Oh, yes,” said Parker, “we
have boats running everywhere.”
Some Vic. State-school teachers, on the
strength of St. John’s certificates, helped in
emergency hospitals during their holidays.
Several of them went down with the epi-
demic, and. being unable to go back to their
school-work, allegedly lost their salary. If
tbis is true, it doesn’t say much for the
cohesion which might be expected to exist
between the various departments of the Law-
son Ministry.
From the beginning of the war up to thr
end of March last, the increase in the cost
of living in the live chief centres of slow-
down-on-the-job Queensland reached Ob

Revolution hasn’t progressed so far, the in-
crease is 41 p.c.; and in Westralia, not yet
perceptibly Bolshevist, the increase has been
a mere 17 p.c.
“Roundsman”: It is true that Peace
medals are to be presented to Vic. school
children (B. 24/4/19), but the Lawson-
Bowser Government is not going to pay for
them. The Federal Treasury, having more
debts than it knows what to do with, is
footing the bill, and Webster is to arrange
to distribute the metal through the post.
The same rule is to obtain in the other five

Commissioners sat up and smiled again when
a postal note for 2s. (id. fluttered in from
someone whose conscience was keeping him
awake. It’s always the small thief who re-
pents. No Commissioner ever found a
£5OOO parcel of notes in his letter-boy.
Small thefts make a man feel mean; large
ones fill him with pride.
On to the already long list of prominent
S. Australians dead this year goes the name
of George Riddocli, a pioneer pastoralist of
the Mt. Gambier district. Scotch by birth,
but educated at Geelong, he was in S.A.
from 1800 onwards. His brother John sat
in the S.A. Assembly with Adam Linsday
Gordon, and both were great sportsmen.
George was in Parliament from 1893 to
1909, off and on. One of the “off” periods
came when in 1897 he encountered Peake,
the present State Premier, making his first
entrance into politics. Peake_ was ahead by
two votes; Riddocli got the election upset,
only to be beaten much worse on a fresh
poll. They became good friends afterwards.
An old friend wrote Riddoch’s best epitaph:
“No traveller ever left his station hungry.”
Davey Hall, N. S. Wales Attorney-Gen-
eral, had a party the other day. on the
completion of his seventh year in office.
Premier Holman, who had charge of the
butter-dish, mentioned that he and his little
barnacle friend were the only two who had
clung on for so long. Of McGowen’s origi-
nal Ministers actually Holman alone is left:
he has been in the tart-shop continuously for
8J years. Little Davey arrived 18 months
later after dropping out of the House of
Reps, and taking a seat in the Council.
George Fuller has been affable in two
Houses; Hall has been a busy wire-puller
in three.
The attitude that the A.W.U. Convention
will probably take up towards the 0.8. F.
scheme may be guessed from the fact that
Grayndler, General Sec. of the A.W.U., has
castigated Garden, the 0.8. U. secretary, in
the Worker, the A.W.U. newspaper. It is
the “white-ant” policy of Garden and his
friends that Grayndler chiefly resents: he
significantly remarks that a ballot on the
question of joining the 0.8. U. can’t be taken
by A.W.U. branches individually, but that
the whole organisation only can ballot on
such a ouestion. Still, some of the dele-
gates from North Queensland, who are
avowedly I.W.W. sympathisers, will make
trouble.
N. S. Wales Full Court has had another
misfortune. Five High Court judges sit-
ting together have unanimously reversed one
of its decisions. It was in Judd’s case.
Originally the defence wanted Ferguson, J..
to. find that the indictment was bad because
Lit. Groom and not Hughes had signed it.
Ferguson said that Groom was acting for
Hughes arid as his Ministerial substitute
had the power conferred by law to do all
that Hughes could do, and refused the appli-
cation accordingly. Gordon, J., agreed
with Ferguson on appeal; the weak Cullen
and another disagreed. As a result of the
High Court’s last word Judd, the 0.8. U.
man, will have to come up for sentence —for
letting his tongue run loose in Avar-time.
John Edward Birt. just defeated by seven
votes in the Paddington fN.S.W.) Labor
selection ballot, was one of the party’s very
best talkers a few years ago. With Dr.
Worrall and the brilliant little Father DoaaT
ing, now both dead, he held up the oratorical
end of the Robert Emmet centenary celebra-
tions. at Wa\ r erley cemetery. No Labor
candidate has had worse luck. In 1904 he
ran Dan Levy Avithin 200 A r otes for the then
Tory 7 seat of Darlinghurst. Three years
later he looked safe for Surry Hills against
Dr. Graham ; but the late W. P. Crick, un-
horsed, butted in as a sort of injured inde-
pendent. Birt, after carrying the dead
weight of Crick’s 1400 votes, ran such a
good second" that the few informal votes cast
in the contest, had they come his w*ay, would
bav>e given him the seat. Some ‘thought
Surry Hills would have been a good thing
for him at the next election, but he didn’t
even get the party selection. Harry HoyL
had come to live close to where the League
met.

The agreement with Steele
Rudd for the English-American rights of
“On Our Selection” and “Grandad Rudd” is
for a term of three years.
“Winkey”: Rumored that Bert Bailey
intends carrying “The Selection” farces to
London. If (as it has been reported) he
takes MacDonald and only one other Aus-
tralian actor with him, he is likely to meet
trouble. There are no English mummers
who could possibly play the parts as they
are written; moreover, if the Australian
isn’t to have any opportunity in his own
country, it seems particularly hard lines that
he must also be excluded from doing his bit
in this new and interesting London venture.
English and American actors have for a
long time invaded the Commonwealth
theatres; and should Bailey (good luck to
him!) put up a counter-attack, it appears
reasonable that Duggan, Driscoll and the
rest go with him.
“Lou Par”: The arrival of Harry Lauder
recalls that Adelaide’s own Peter Dawson
once tried his luck in London as a Scotch
comedian and was so successful that be
appeared for over three months on the balls
disguised as Hector Grant. During his
early struggles in England, Dawson, finding
it a sheer impossibility to get work as a
baritone when the concert season subsided,
bluffed a London manager that he came
from Glasgow and was a humorist. David
Allan, who engaged him, was glad to gee
him to feature against Lauder, who was not
then the star he is now; in fact, he was a
novelty having a tremendous vogue. Daw-
son did well. Had he stuck to it there is
no telling where he would have landed. The
baritone, however, “didn’t go all the way
from Adelaide to become a comic singer.”
So beyond making a few gramophone records
of comic songs as Hector Grant, he has
never been guilty of the offence since.
“Ike Pagliacci” : It must be a record for
father, mother and daughter to be playing
leading roles in the same dramatic show.
The Dobsons are doing it with Fuller.
Collet was only 22 when lie appeared as
Othello to Miln’s lago, and was named the
youngest Moor on record. Daughter Agnes
must have also set up a record the other day
when she played Camille at 16. She has
been leading lady in many melodramas, and
the limelight man, who knows the private
history of all pros, backwards, had a spasm
recently at Newtown Majestic (Sydney)
when she turned on the adventuress of the
piece (off stage a matron with several chil-
dren) and, with all the force of her 16
summers, exclaimed: “Ah, you do not know
what it is to have the feelings of a mother!”
Nancye Stewart, “our Nellie’s” hopeful,
who called upon Uncle Sam’s leading show-
men lately, has been requested to come right
in. She gets a chance on Broadway.
“Fax” holds a review:—
the audacity of these American machine-made
plays impresses me more than their ingenuity.
“Eyes of Youth” is “On Trial” plus the incredible
hawker, and illustrated by visions of what blight
happen in the future instead of dreams of what actu-
ally occurred in the past. Both these and “Seven
Keys to Baldpate” bear a close family resemblance
to “Romance,” wherein the play betwixt the open-
ing and closing scenes presented the giddy past of a
bishop whose memories are awakened by the strains
of a gramophone record. These modern American
vision plays, suggested by one another, had their
source in the dream plays of yore. The romantic
opera of “Ma Mie Rosette” deals, like “Eyes of
Youth,” with what might happen, but confines its
action to one hypothesis. The sentimental drama
that Emelie Polini makes acceptable to the husband-
hunting section of the community requires three
hypotheses for its action. And “Ma Mie Rosette”
seemed a plagiarism from “Uncle Dick’s Darling,” a
forgotten eomedv-drama by H. .1. Byron. How much
less unreasonable (also how novel in its day) was the
story of Uncle Dick and his Darling, written for
the late J. L. Toole, and produced at the first Gaiety
in London when it was a new theatre ! Old J.L.T.,
in the Dickens character of a travelling trader whose
warehouse was a caravan, had beauteous Adelaide
Neilson for his ward and companion. The girl had
a faithful, humble lover in John Clayton, and a
haughty, high-toned suitor in Henry Irving, both
Irving and Clayton being at that time on the verge
of celebrity. Toole fell asleep whilst pondering on
Irving's proposal to marry his niece, and the next
two acts were his vision of what would happen if
the poor but virtuous maiden were to marry into
Irving’s lofty, but unpleasant, social circle. Finally
the old man wakes up and sends the rich suitor about
his business even as does Emelie Polini in “Eyes of
Youth.” In “Ma Mie Rosette” it was the heroine
who fell in a faint and dreamed. One would say
that “Eyes of Youth” was inspired by “Ma Mie
AT THE PICTURE EXHIBITION.
SHE: “Hut-ten guineas! That seems an awful lot far such a. little thing.”
DEALER (nutting in a good word for it) : “Yes, but you know it's all done by hand.”
Rosette” (the offspring of “Uncle Dick”) had not all
these similar American plays intervened. Of the six
stories mentioned, “Eyes of Youth” is the last and
least possible. It never begins to look realistic,
owing to the early intrusion of the wandering Hindu
with his magic crystal and his talk about the Soul.
A sweet-voiced actress, gifted with an easy manner
and a little emotional power, may carry such a play
along; but the audacity of its construction, out of
old, old material, strikes a critic pink.
“Arab”: Denis Kehoe’s success at Mel-
bourne Playhouse sets the seal to Allen
Doone’s assertion: “Give me a green flag
and a piano, and I’ll tour Australia the
whole year round.”
“Winkey”: Dick Bellairs, late King in
Hamlet,” now plutocrat of Flinders-lane.
recently gave an exhibition shadow-spar
which startled many of his best friends. It
was a pneumonic bout, and once Dr. Drew
ceased to hold out hope. But in the end
Bellairs was able to dodge the curly scythe,
and has just returned from putting in six
brown weeks under the sun at Dromana.
Orphan Onn”: I remember a very early
production of “The Doctor’s Dilemma” (it
was quite an historical occasion, too, because
it is from that date that Gregan McMahon
began to say good-bye to his hair). Every-
thing was at sixes and sevens. Redpemiy
was down with the stomach-ache, the leading
lady had had her name spelt without a
hyphen on the programme, and none of the
carpets had arrived; then, when all these
little difficulties had been smoothed out
(including the stomach-ache), it was dis-
covered that there was no lay figure for
the important studio scene. “There, sir,
now you’ve got everything,” said the boss
scene-shifter. “Everything!” gasped Mac.
“Everything? Do you call that everything?
Where's my lay figure?" “Ah, I thorcher’d
be asking for that,” answered the boss scene-
shifter, and, having disappeared momen-
tarily into the property-room, he emerged
staggering under the hideous effigy of a
Chinese giant he had borrowed out of Ivreit-
meyer’s waxworks. “There y’are, Mister
Mick Mahon,” he said, and, looking up with
the beer running slowly down from his eyes
—“’Ow’s that for a Malay figure?”
“Norbell”: When more slapdash methods
obtained in the picture-making business,
Jack Gavan did some astonishing things in
and about Sydney. He thought nothing of
securing the unconscious co-operation of
total strangers. Followed by an astute
camera-man, Gavan once made use of a
bewigged and begowned barrister in King-
street. He accosted a likely-looking legal
mark who was hurrying to court, and asked
some preposterous question, and whilst the
indignant counsel expressed his opinion feel-
ingly and fluently, the lurking operator did
the rest. Once the Darlinghurst Gaol authori-
ties refused to allow Gavan the use of their
front gate. But that didn’t end the matter.
The “stunt” required was the hero's dis-
charge from quod. The conspirators waited
outside the gate until Black Maria was
admitted. The hero calmly followed her in
and the gates clanged behind him. Inside
the lodge an indignant warder demanded
what the something-or-other the strangely-
painted intruder wanted. “Just to have a
look round,” he blandly explained. The
warder exploded, and as he “discharged” the
hero through the wicket, with delighted real-
ism, the camera-fiend recorded an incident
which was afterwards much admired in
“Falsely Accused.”
At Richmond (Vic.) races the
other clay all the jockeys wore black arm-
bands in memory of cross-country-rider H.
Fames, whom the 'flu claimed. I recollect
another case of mourning amid gay trap-
pings. A chorus-girl died during the run of
a Sydney musical show, and permission to
wear any mourning on the stage was refused.
The girls, however, thought that the stage
was the correct place to show their regard
for their late favorite, and most of them
turned up in the evening wearing the tip of
a black glove. An enraged stage-manager
found that, by extraordinary coincidence,
almost every girl had cut her first finger on
the same day.
“Pollio”: “Andrew Ralph” (B. 17/4/T9t
mentions Felice Lyne as one of the rare
slender Gildas. Lucky for her that she was
She went to London in 1911 or 1912 her-
alded by the usual Yankee boom, and all the
musical critics prepared to put the knife in.
But, to the surprise of a great many opera-
goers, her first-night notices (she opened as
Gilda) slopped over with applause. Some
of us were persuaded into spending hard
cash on the next performance of “Itigoletto’’
—and came away cursing the critics. Then
we looked up the first-night notices again
and read them more carefully. The eulogy
was there: we hadn’t dreamt it. But it
wasn’t so much for her singing—that part
was obviously politeness to the newcomer.
What had knocked every critic off his perch
and loosed the floods of gush was the fact
that Felice was young and slim enough to be
herself carried off in a sack by her abductors.
No Gilda for years past had risked that;
previous sacks had always been loaded with
the lightest chorus-girl in the cast, while
the prima donna wrapped her logs in a cloak
and sat complacently in the wings.
“Winkey”; Victor FitzFlerbert had the
good luck to be sitting in a King’s Theatre
box on the first night of “The Eyes of
Youth.” One of the eo. fell out of the
team, and Fitz, after a Sunday rehearsal,
played the part of Robert Goring on Monday
—did it perfectly, and has continued to do it
ever since. This young player glitters about
in a golopslius hat and adds to his thoroughly
midnight appearance a voice suggestive of a
cannon-ball rolling down a rainbow; it is
said that he has seduced more women (on
the stage) and stolen more money (on the
stage) than any bank-clerk (off the stage)
in the whole of Australia.
“Madame Elsa Stralia,” engaged for opera
at Covent Garden, London, used to be the
Adelaide girl Elsa Fischer.
In self-defence the show-business in Wel-
lington (M.L.) has been driven to organise
and run candidates for the City Council at
the end of this month. The chosen ones are
Bert Royle, the rep. for the Firm in M.L.,
and E. J. Itighton, managing-director of
Picture Supplies Ltd.
“Fax”: Apropos of the late Charles
Wyndham and his long connection with
beauteous Mary Moore at the Criterion, Aus-
tralia’s old-time friend Edward Sass (more
of a veteran than he looked) once remarked:
“Why, my boy, I was at the Criterion in
the early part of the reign of Wyndham and
Mary.” Sass was doomed to play heavy
gentlemanly-villain parts in drama when
Australia knew him, but once at a charity
matinee he revealed himself as a natural
comedian in a recitation entitled “The
Wreck of the Puffin.”
Carrie Lanceley, who owns a good Aus-
tralian voice, is touring Maoriland under
engagement to Picture Supplies, Ltd.
“Felix B.” : Two big features of the Rigo
opera performances are the beautiful solo
orchestral achievements by Slapoffski and
his murderous method, in accompaniment, of
drowning the voices of the principals. I
have heard each production to date and in
practically all duets and vocal concertos the
melody and harmony were ruined by the
orchestral storm. Elsy Treweek’s sweet
finishing notes could seldom be heard in
“Maritana” and “Faust,” whilst the great
sextet in “Lucia” sounded more like a
Philharmonic nightmare in the bad-sounding
Melbourne Town Hall.
“Stargazer”; Fair exchange is no robbery,
but when we send Dorothy Bruntons, and
get back —well, almost any you care to men-
tion, there is more than room for a suspicion
that we are being taken down. An actor
man puts the situation to me wjtli brutal
frankness. “What do you expect?” says he.
“It is the disposition of Australia to part
with her successes; it is Old England’s fixed
determination to cling to hers.” It suggests
the favorite In Memoriam verse telling of
that Providence
Who takes the good, too good with us to stay,
And yields the ones fit but to give away.
Actor Charles Wyndham left estate valued
at £197,000.
“Orphan Onn”: Victor Fitzherbert, as a
pasty husband in the court-room scene of
“The Eyes of Youth,” adopts a far-away,
lost expression which has its effect. “Ah.”
said a returned soldier-artist, “note I know
where Millais got the inspiration for his
picture of ‘Bubbles.’ ”
An American film co. has laid hands at
last on the old “Silver King.” The play
seems just made for that treatment, but has
had a long time to wait for it. The a!l-
Amdrican setting—railway train, racecourse
scene, etc. —makes a good bluff at looking
English. William Faversham plays the
modest hero who requests to have the uni-
verse put back on his account.
“Talky” : It was at a recent of
the interminable “Doctor’s Dilemma.” Five
o’clock was approaching and the fifth act
had not yet started. “Who did you say tins
piece was by?” asked a young thing in
the dress-circle of her companion. “Ber-
nard Jaw,” was the reply.
NOT HERSELF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Erroll, the Australian comedian and dancer, who
was a successful producer in New York, and is now
a hit in London, says he much prefers plain girls for
chorus and show work, as they are much less trouble-
some than pretty ones, and with effective make-up
and good lighting any girl can be made beautiful on
the stage.
The lovely girls with liquid eyes,
By all the graces moved.
Are not desired by actors wise—
They cannot be improved.
The type that’s ugly, raw and old,
Superior to aught else is,
A scaffolding on which to mould
A show girl in excelsis.
Forget not this if you should “place”
One foremost in the line,
So beautiful of shape and face,
With eyes that glow like wine.
She’s so well-made, so radiant fair,
Her beauty makes you sit up ;
But what is she when not all there,
Nor adequately lit up?

These Epidemic Days
A Word of Advice
to the Users of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
During these Epidemic Days the people
who are in the habit of using Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills are advised to use them
a little more freely than during normal
times. Those who are familiar with the
directions, which accompany each bottle, know that over-
dosing with this remedy is never urged, neither are people
made to believe they have imaginary ills simply to sell a few
more pills. A good pill, however, is supplied the public to
meet the requirements of the healthy man and woman who,
from time to time, find that nature needs a little assistance.
One person might require only one pill a week, some two or
three times a week, while still others may need from one to
three dally. So those who are in the habit of taking Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills soon learn to a nicety the exact number to take to keep their
system in proper working order, but while this Epidemic rages it is strongly
advised that Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills be taken much more freely than
in normal times. It is suggested that from one to three pills be taken
nightly with 10 grains of Aspirin. Don’t allow any waste to accumulate in
the system, for therein lurk the germs which cause disease. When the
Epidemic abates, reduce the number of pills taken to just enough to keep
the system working smoothly. By taking these simple precautions,
catching the Epidemic may be avoided.
GIVE THE DOCTOR A CHANCE. —ln case of feelihg
out of sorts, with general pains in the back, head or legs,
DON’T go chasing around looking for a doctor, but go home
and SEND for one. Don’t frighten some medical practitioner
half to death by the fear that you may have infected his
waiting-room full of patients and himself as well. It is only
fair to give the medical man a chance to deal with your case
with as much safety to himself as possible, and this he
cannot do if you go hunting for him.

Lanins was resold in Sydney on Monday
for 2500 guineas, which is exactly what H. G. Noble
paid for him 14 months a«m. He has already won

he is looking his best. Adam Skirving will train

The top price at the Sydney yearling sales,
which ended last week, was 1100 guineas. It was
paid for a superb bay colt, full-brother to Flnmark
and Estland, and bred at T. H. Lowry's Hawkes Bay

of'Wise Bird, fetched a thousand guineas.

he deserved to be, but ne never had a word of blame
for a trainer or jot key, and when he had a success
his generosity was magnificent. He was chairman of
the V.R.C. for 10 years, and a great and imaginative
chairman, too. Svlvanite (Debutant Stakes, A.J.C.
Derbv and Vie. Derby) was the best he ever owned.

As usual, on the morning after the Oak-
bank races there was a gala day at the Woodside
Magistrate’s Court. Twenty-two bookmakers were
charged with breaching the S. Aus. Lottery and Gam-
ing Act. They were all convicted, and all promptly
sparred up their fines, to the tune of £lBB. There
is something wrong with the system. Either the
State ought to license the books straight out, and
thereby make about £50,000, which it is now sacri-
ficing/ or the fines under the Act should be stiff
enough to render them effective.
“0.K.”: Re jockey Carslake's talk about
the glories (somewhat faded) of horse-racing in
England, the difference between class-governed rac-
ing on “town moors,” “downs” and “heaths” in
England, and the carefully-planned oval courses in
Australia, where everybody pays for admission, is
much the same as the dif. between old-fashioned
fist-fighting in the open and modern boxing-matches
in buildings erected for the purpose. The toffs, who
paid for their fun, got almost a monopoly of sight-
seeing at the old tights, whilst the outside mob sup-
plied the yelling. In our modern buildings consecrated
to pugilism everybody can see the sport. In England
the general public is not catered for; the meetings
are not run as gate-money shows for the community
in general, nor can I think of any old course, save
the “Rliodee” at Chester, that gave the public a
free exhibition. Coming to Melbourne from Eng-
land long ago the superiority of Flemington to any
racing place I knew struck me dumb. For the first
time I was getting a good turf show at compara-
tively small trouble and expense. But I can quite
understand that Carslake should approve of racing
in England. He earns big money without running
much risk. Jockeys rarely get killed or injured in
England, and the life of a fashionable rider, who
travels with a valet, is a pretty soft thing.

Died in Adelaide at Easter, James Jen-
kins, aged 76, one of the very best local trainers in
his time, and useful in the saddle, too. Some of his
best work w r as done for Thomas Elder long ago. He
both trained and rode Pride of the Hills when it
won the S.A.J.C. Derby.
# * * *
The Onkaparinga (S.A.) race meeting of
1919 will be remembered as the Day of Dust. Adel-
aide has had no rain worth mentioning for over two
months; a most confident official forecast of a wet
Easter Monday went wrong; and the drive up from
Adelaide through the hills was a smothering per-
formance. For once train-travellers had the best of
it, though the tunnels were stifling. For the Great
Eastern Steeple 15 started, and eight got over the
3J miles and 21 jumps. Tararu Jack, with his M.L.
reputation and a penalty earned in Melbourne, had
to carry 13st., and was a bad fourth. The favorite
was Mullins's Doiran, who won last year with lOst.
61b. With list. 4lb. this time he was backed down
to level money, and came home alone. The race had
not been won by the same horse twice running for
about 40 years. The Onkaparinga Cup was won by
A. iL. Hamilton’s Melbolt from Richardson's Depend-
ence, a very hot favorite in Timms’s Kingbier being
third. The Hills Railway Stakes is a race with an
odd history. K. D. Bowman’s Miss Neckersgat won
it in 1916-17-18. Hopwood was in charge each time.
This year he changed to Placidia, and beat Miss
Neckersgat by four lengths. He has ridden the
winner in six of the last seven years. About
£31,000 went through the totalisator, which is half
as much again as in 1916, and close up to the before-
the-tvar record.
licit, the trainer of Mistico these last
few months, gets much credit for the nag’s recovery
of his old Wcstralian form. Followers of the son of
Linaere were beginning to despair of the veteran,
when lie started again to perform quite brilliantly ;
and having made the fresh start, he continued his
well-doing, after the manner of matured male horses
that have found the dash they had lost. At Caul-
field on Easter Monday he ran six furlongs in
lmin. 14isec., giving exactly 4st. to the third
horse. On the same day and course, Court Jester
ran a good race over 11 furlongs, the best race he
had run for more than two years. Horses that Eric
Connolly parts with rarely bloom afresh, but Court
Jester las been steadily improving since he beat
Night Watch for the Hotham Handicap last Derby
day, and he should always have a chance in a long-
distance handicap when r.ot weighted beyond his
strength. One wouldn't rush to hack the dandy gee
for a welter race.
» * * *
Alf Felton (who is with the A.I.F. in
England) is a possible challenger of Ernest Barry
for the world’s sculling championship. Felton was
below championship form when he left the Parra-
matta, but he is said to have adequate backing for
the race.
* * * *
Adelaide lias seen a bowls match pro-
bably unique. The team on one side consisted of
four' generations of the Lodge family, running from
90 down to 12. and it won handsomely from a
veteran four whose ages made the same total—2o6.
Col. Castine, who is a mere 73, was captain of the
other side.
The success of Beragoon at the stud is a
reminder that the handsome dual Derby
winner had a comparatively easy time on
the turf, ar.d retired from racing when he
was only a four-year-old. The racers that
have done much battling don't make
brilliant parents. Although he was a star
juvenile Beragoon ran only six races in
his first season, winning the first three.
As a three-year-old he ran nine times, the
two Derbies being his only wins. Appa-
rently the son of Multiform was not a
true stayer, for little Badnor beat him in
the A.J C. Leger, and when he ran fifth
in a Melbourne Cup it was the highly
unsatisfactory race which Posinatus was
allowed to win in slow time.
“Slip” : N.S.W. Cricket Assoc, might give
a thought to the promotion next season of Mosnian
to first-grade. Mosnian has been on top in second-
grade for the past two seasons, and was runner-up in
1916-17. Some of the individual efforts were brilliant
—such as C. Campbell’s 723 runs, averaging 45.18,
and G. L. Smedlcy’s 74 wickets, averaging 10.87. At
present first-grade is studded with weak clubs. Last
year Gordon and Balmain each lost seven and Sydney
and Central Cumberland eig’’t matches out of 1,3. It
would be odds on Mosnian licking any of them.
Melbourne’s last cricket match for the
season was exciting. Havelock, which is a sort of
junior South Melbourne, played Yarraville for the
V.J.C.A. pennant, and scored 154 in its first innings
to Yarraville’s 114. At the second go Yarraville
lose n'ine wickets for 151, and its name looked like
its native slush. Then Stephenson and Fielding got
going, piled on another 140 and left. Havelock 252
to make. This wasn't impossible; but, when Have-
lock lost its first wicket for four Yarraville set off
to order the drinks However, P. Heather and Gherar-
clin stuck togther till the board showed 178-—Heather
145—and the match was virtually over. Havelock
finally got the pennant by four wickets. As usual
the junior final drew a larger house than any senior
game, crowds of 6000 on Easter Saturday and Monday
yielding £325 to the Ass. coffers.
* * * *
A strong Sydney cricket team which went,
a few' miles west for Easter struck a couple of
may-be champions. Edgar Bonnor, of Orange, made
75 against them in taking style. (He is a nephew
of George Bonnor, w'ho tripped with the Australian
Xl’s of ’BO, ’B2, ’B4 and ’86.) And C. Allman, of
Molong, who shattered eight of their wdekets for
100 in an innings.
Among the week’s ’flu victims in Mel-
bourne was Frank Hyett, who kept wickets for Vic.
in the last inter-State match, and, besides shining
there, was a handy batsman.
“Sarto”: Here’s another record. In a
recent one-innings match between the Grammar and
High Schools at Albury (N.S.W.), six of the last-
mentioned team were caught and all of the other
side. Sixteen men out of 22 caught, leaving only
four bowled.
-Timmy Wilde, the greatest flyweight the
w'orld has yet produced, lias never been able to get
a match at his own weight. The lowest recognised
in the boxing world is Bst., but it takes him all his
time to make seven.
Eugene Yolaire, the French lightweight,
fought Bob Williams in Brisbane on Saturday night.
It was a willing go, and the referee called it a
draw’.
* * * *
A. E. Sutton won the 200 miles handicap
at the Mortlake (Vic.) Motor-cycling Racing Carni-
val. He rode a 4-h.p. Dunlop-shod Indian, and with
a 70min. start set the back-markers an impossible
task by averaging nearly 50 miles an hour for the
journey. It was a big day for both Indian machines
and Dunlop tyres. In addition to securing first and
second places in the big event the combination also
secured the fastest laps and fastest times for the race
itself for machines both under and over 600 c.c.
G. Wright scored full points in the Reliability
Contest on a 7-h.p. Harley-Davidson, fitted with Bar-
net Glass tyres. He has competed in all the Vic.
M.C.C. reliability competitions during the last 2£
years without losing a single point. His effort at
Mortlake gains him the championship of the club for
the season.

“Aerial”: A returned Australian air-pilot
now at Point Cook (Vic.) claims to have travelled
faster than any other man ever went since the world
began. On a long down-liill run on one of the
latest tvpe of scouts, with the engine going strong,
he nit up 300 miles an hour. As a general thing
150 miles an hour i 3 a clipper gait for even the
latest machines. # #
“G. Bung”: In a pub at Moss Vale
(N.S.W.) there was a discussion on the recent Mel-
bourne-to-Sydney aeroplane flight. A returned
Digger was dilating on the enormous speed aero-
planes develop, and remarked that the pair would
not take more than 20 minutes to go from Moss
Vale to Campbelltown. Whereupon one old chap
with shaggy whiskers rejoined contemptuously: “So
they well oughter. It’s down hill all the
way!”
#• * * *
There was an amazing finish to an acci-
dent in the Adelaide hills on Onkaparinga Cup day.
A car with six people in it crashed through the
(probably ant-eaten) fence on the Norton Summit
road, and charged into the gully. About a
hundred yards down it encountered a hole deep
enough to' stop it and smash it. The party were
strewn all about the hill; but broken ribs for the
driver was the worst of the trouble. Even the car
is expected to be worth hauling up.
The amalgamation of Sydney baseball fac-
tions is having its after-effects in the rush of entries
for the grade matches in the coming winter. Forty-
one teams have entered —10 of them first-graders—
and seven clubs are represented with three teams
each. There will probably be an inter-State match
this season; and there’s a move to bring a nine from
America next year.

Garfield Finlay got back to Sydney last
week with a D.F.C. He has been the champion
breast-stroke swimmer of Australia for seven years.
Young G. L.
Patterson, whom Hal
Gye pictures herewith,
and who is Brookes’s
choice for the world]s
championship tennis
events, won a tourna-
ment at Roehampton
Club last week. There
is no great significance
in it, however.. Roe-
hampton is a fashion-
alile riverside suburb
of London where ten-
nis is more a social
function than a stern
business. Few of the
leaders of the game
competed.
“R.S.”: And still nobody has done the
army donk. full credit! 1 was for nearly two years
in the next hottest place to Hell—that’s Mesopo-
tamia—where the mercury at times got over 130 deg.
in the shade; yet the donk. would always come up
smiling and salute the smiling morn with his “Hee-
haw hawnk!” On two occasions we got away from
the Tigris, and had to depend on what water we
could find to give the poor old crocks a wet. The
first trip took us three days and the second four
days; and the only moisture we had was in our
waterbottles. When we started back for the river
again the donks were as fresh as ever, but the few
horses that we had were knocked up and their riders
had to lead them. The Tigris was 30 miles away
and the desert was nearly all soft sandy soil, through
which our old reliable friend had to pull the guns
and waggons. On the first crawl back to the river
each little beast had a couple of men aboard, besides
having to do his other work. The camel can stand
a lot of hardships, but in my opinion the donkey,
which is, by the way, the most abused animal in the
army, can almost equal the stinker when it comes to
a test of drought endurance. Another thing about
a donk. is that he can live on almost anything.
After a good feed of oats he will tackle picket-ropes,
old bags, the harness, saddle-blankets, biscuits, jam
and bully-beef. I don’t think he’d eat Minister for
Defence Pearce; but, then, there is a limit even to a
donkey’s stomach.

“Malcolm Mac”: Large catches of snap-
per, red-bream, flathead and leather-jackets are being
obtained outside Port Hacking and off Cronulla
(N.S.W.). One party on Easter Mondav hauled up
11 dozen in a little over three hours. But everyone
is cursing a nasty-smelling Bolshevik that looks like
a cross between a mackerel and a toad. Anyone
know its name?

Gerald Halpin had a tilt at the amateur
cycling quarter-mile unpaced record at Sydney last
week. The figures on “the book’’ are Ernie
Schneider’s 26 3-ssec. Halpin did the distance in
27sec.
Queensland amateur cycling champion J.
King put up two State unpaced flying-start records
at Brisbane recently—the half-mile in 61 3-sset\,
and the mile in 2min. 18see. #
“Azac”: The trout season which has just
closed was made barren by the cormorant. One
fisherman lately returned to Sydney from the Snowy
reports that the biggest bag in four weeks was four
fish, when in a fair season it should have been 15U.
In the tucker bag of one bird he shot was a 14lin.
trout weighing about ljlb. Besides devouring the
mature fish these pests do even greater harm by
making their ways up the small tributaries of the
streams and eating the fry.
“Gouger” : • Many b-sche-de-mer fishermen
will not eat the giant rock-cod caught outside the
Bariier reef for fear of suffering violent fish-poison-
ing. Not every rock-cod is poisonous, but about one
in 20 appears to be so. I was mate on a cutter
anchored outside the reef. One of the blackboys
caught a giant cod. Boiled it. The skipper and
myself were partial to the head. Gave the rest to
the boys. About two hours afterwards the “old
man” and I thought we’d swallowed the devil. I
only just managed to run the cutter into Cairns.
The skipper rolled about the deck for hours in help-
less agony., lie spent two months in hospital before
recovery. I got off with a fortnight. The crew
were not affected in any way. Blackboys say some
of these fish eat a poisonous weed that grows only
outside the reef. Certainly all rock-cod inside the
Barrier are very edible fish. Wily old sea limits, to
make sire, drop a bright silver coin in the boiling
pot. If the coin comes out discolored or black, the
mess ■ stung overboard. If Vue coin conics out
clean, then the fish goes where it will do most good.
“Fernleaf”: Died recently of pneumonia
in England, Sergeant-Major C. Slattery, of the M.L.
permanent staff of instructors, and one time a crack
wing-threequarter of the Wellington Province.
Carrying about 14st. over the paddock at a rate of
between 10 and 11 sec. per 100 yards lie was a
splendid type of the scoring back, beloved of the
North Island teams about the end of the last cen-
tury. Slattery and the type of player he repre-
sented will bn remembered by the N. S. Wales team
which invaded Maoriland in ’Ol. That combination,
only just off the sea, went down to Wellington hv
17 to 16, after the most exciting big game ever
seen in the M.L. capital. The same season Slattery
provided the most sensational ending to any game
seen on the Caledonian ground at Duneuin, by
winning the annual tussle for Wellington as the bell
was almost ringing the finish. A quiet, unassuming
player, he always had the true sport's explanation
for every defeat: “Met a better team!”
M.L. won the International Eight-oar race
on the Seine on Sunday last from a Yankee crew,
mostly consisting of ex-Yale, Harvard and Cornell
oarsmen. Australia didn't compete, but such Aus-
tralians as were in Paris gave hearty moral support
to the Maori landers from the river-banks. The cable
says that “a strong wind was blowing and the water
was rough.” This would have suited M.L., whose
oarsmen row with the long steady stroke which is
fashionable at Henley. The Yanks favor a short,
snappy stroke, and they are usually poor watermen.
Stawell (Vie.) Easter Gift (£105) went
this year to H. W, Evans, of Abbotsford, who from
101yds. won in 12 l-ssec. from W. Twomev
(9§yds.) and S. Irwin (81yds). H. A. Auchen. who
is only 18, annexed the Stewards’ Purse (220yds.)
and the Sprint handicap.
G. W. Norris (Yaralla) scored 19 con-
secutive bull’s-e v <% at 800.yds. in Svdney on Satur-
day. The effort included the “possible” at the
second stage. Altogether he scored 67 out of 70.
G. Williamson (Mosman-Neutral Bay) notched the
double “possible” (70) at the same distance in
“B” grade.
* * # *
j “Umntu”: Rufe Naylor, (lie Australian
racehorse-owner who was recently tried in Johannes-
burg (S’Africa) for bribing members of the Provin-
cial Council, is not to be given the benefit of the
disagreement among the jurymen, the Attorney-
General having ordered a fresh trial. The whole
story is extraordinary. Naylor, according to his own
showing, was blackmailed by Dingwall and Yan
Veyeren, who then turned King’s evidence; and in
any case, he says, the money he gave them was to
help them do a public duty—vote for a racing-
restriction Bill, Naylor outbidding his rival, who
wanted them to vote against it. The Judge, in
summing-up, told the ratters thev were mean crimi-
nals. At least one of them will not enjoy his ill-
gotten cash. He had it in his bedroom, and during
the trial some burglars got away with the hoard.

Lyon Wise, of Westralia, the deviser of
the new self-rescue water-creep, has now proved that
a weak child can quickly learn and apply the sys-
tem. Wise contends that swimming can be learned'
before walking; directly a child can crawl on land
it can also creep in water, simply by shutting its
mouth, breathing through its nose, and using its own
easy natural movements, by which the hands and arms
naturally move inwards and waistwards, and the
legs keep bending and straightening a little onward.
A demonstration was given recently. Forty-seven
infants of from six to seven years (younger infants
if obtainable would have been tested) were given
preliminary land-drill, and were then required to
swim publicly at least 18ft. without touchimr
ground and without any aid whatever. Thirty-six
did it at their first attempt.
In M.L. sheaf-throwing is still a feature
at agricultural shows. At Hawarden, recently, 35
entered, and the 6ft. stages cut competitors out till
two men tackled the job of tossing the sheaf 30ft.

A Skilful Boxer Fears No Foe!
t^k
A skilful Boxer is a man to be envied and admired.
He has himself under complete control. He has been taught to be
patient and tolerant. He is not easily “put out,” and usually is the last
to seek a quarrel.
When he is forced, however, to defend himself, he does it with a quiet
calm that breathes self-confidence in his every action. He is not flurried
in the least. He has a set plan, and adapts himself to circumstances. He
reserves his strength until the other fellow is getting “groggy.” He is
always doing the right thing at the right time.
Would you like to be a skilful boxer—to be able to give aggressive
individuals a couple of stone and a beating? Then, why not learn
Scientific Boxing from me in your own home?

is the last touch of refinement in the toilet of a
dainty woman.
But they must be perfect in every detail. Texture,
Stitching, Mould, Style, Finger-tips, Fit. These all
find their fullest expression in
VANITY FAIR
The Glove of Charm and Distinction.
While the VANITY FAIR GLOVE costs no
more than other makes, every pair contains a signed
guarantee.
HERE IT IS :
“If these Gloves wear through at the finger-
tips anv time before they are washed, and
before the rest of the Glove has had
reasonable wear, we will, upon receipt of
this ticket and your Gloves, replace them
with a new Pair.”
The Sydney agent for the Mill is personally responsible
for this guarantee.

CHAPTER
Warners Rust proos
corsets
Governor Stanley will open the Vic.
Parliament for the last time on July 1 or 2.
The escort, guard of honor and other cere-
monial concomitants will not be quite so
skeletonised as they have been of late. By
the end of next month it will be known
whether or not the Davieses will be host and
hostess at the At Home which will follow
the opening ceremony. If these veterans do
not issue the invitations it is pretty certain
that the Government will. Premier Lawson
is bound to know in good time what to do, as
he is related, by marriage, to the Davies
family.
Now that Lady Stanley has departed, his
Ex.’s experience at Walhalla may be related.
After laying a foundation-stone or opening
a rose show or something, the Governor’s
party put up at the principal hotel. During
the evening a dapce was held at the inn, and
the astonishment of the aide measured 10(j
deg. when he discovered the popular top-hat
amongst the gay and festive waltzers, and,
later, joining in the usual refreshments for
the “gents.” The boss remarked at the ter-
mination of the evening that he had never
enjoyed himself so well.
Syd Kidman’s yarn that his 14th share in
Broken Ilill was sold to a present director
for £l5O is not quite so “fetching” as the one
drawn from the late William Knox (another
Millionaire) when tempted to talk of the
romance of gold-mining. Knox narrated that
he was offered a chance for a comparative
trifle in a new gold show at Hannan’s
(W.A.) when he arrived at Albany on his
way back from England to Melbourne. He
was about to agree to a suggestion to go up
and inspect, when a telegram was handed to
him informing him that his wife had given
birth to a daughter. (All the other chil-
dren were sons.) The man interested in
Hannan’s resumed the discussion of the
arrangements for journeying to tlie future
Coolgardie, but Knox cut him short. He
declared that six Hannans rolled into one
would not interfere with his going on by the
boat. His friend raged, but he would not
shift. lie saw the girl in a week, but esti-
mated that he lost £200.000 by his hurry.
“She was worth the sacrifice,” Knox added.
The story was spread, and the women voters
flocked to vote for Knox next election.
Before he became a bishop Dr. Stretch
conducted the burial service over Chief
Justice Higinbotham in St. Andrew’s
Church, Brighton. It was on January 2,
1893, and the church had been decorated
elaborately for the Christmas and New Year
services. Only a very few made the sacri-
fice of going to the service to pay the last
tribute to “Victoria’s foremost citizen,” ns
Shiels described him. Stretch got in before
Premier Shiels with a panegyric quite
worthy of the great judge—to whom, by
the way, no public memorial has yet
been raised in Vic.
When Governor Stanley went to Wanga-
ratta at last week-end to present certificates
to soldiers, attend the Wangaratta Cup meet-
ing, and generally take part in the Back to
the Old Town movement, Mayor W. Callan-
der made him his guest in his villa overlook-
ing the town. C. J. Ahern, formerly
M.H.R., who is now a member of the Gillott-
Moir legal firm, built the place when he
lived at Wangaratta. His Ex. was made
very comfortable, and Bowser felt pleased
that mayoral hospitality was beyond cavil in
his constituency.
Melbourne has lost an active philanthropic
worker and an all-round good sort by the
death from pneumonia of the second Mrs.
T. J. Davey. For the two years that her
husband was Gaud Mayor, Mrs. Davey, who
in appearance was an impressive edition of
Queen Elizabeth, proved a highly successful
hostess. She was holiday-making at Heales-
ville when her cold arrived, and in a couple
of days all was over.
Warrnambool is to have a whirling fort-
night beginning on Monday. May 5. The
Western District folk have planned a round
of-revels, and every room and verandah in
the district is booked up. The Very Best
Merinos are due at the Steeplechase Races
and also at a ball, which will be as gorgeous
as they can make it. ..
Mrs. Glenloth Peter is preparing to cheer
on the Geelong rowers during the coming
Head of the River races on the Yarra —
special dinner and theatre parties are being
arranged for the lucky young oarsmen, of
whom son Cecil is one. Mrs. Peter had
, the crew motored to Queenscliff from Gee-
long last week to a dinner party with a nice
assortment of school-girl partners.
Captain Forrest is screwing up a new
brass plate in Collins-street. The young
doctor, who finished up his war work in
Caulfield Hospital, is married to a daughter
of the rich Monaine, of Melbourne, and is
a son of Dr. and Mrs. Forrest, of Charters
Towers. Mother is now in Melbourne
superintending the decoration of his new
quarters.
Everard Browne is still seriously ill. He
had driven a waggonette to the local rail-
way station from his Western District
squattage, when the horses shied at a pass-
ing motor-cyclist, throwing him under the
wheels, which passed over his head. Colac
was startled by tbe accident, for Everard is
genuinely liked, thanks to his cheery per-
sonality and absence of “dog.”
Ice-skating begins again at the Glaciarium
this (Thursday) afternoon. The young and
nimble will slither to the music of Di Gilio’s
band.
Girls’ hostels are the fashion. Lady
Helen started the ball rolling by having
parties and meetings about the matter.
Mrs. Tivey gave a big crush at her Hunting-
tower-road house last week, and Mrs. Mur-
ray Morton will hold a rally soon. This
is merely the beginning, so the public can
start to save up.
Mrs. Hyde is a small sensation in sassiety.
circles. She is the English bride of Captain
Hyde, just arrived here as chief naval intel-
ligence-officer. She was a young war widow
when she married the Captain, and has looks
and dash. Ilubby has gone off to Westralia
to arrange the welcome to Jellicoe, so the
lady is putting up at the Bussell Clarkes’
home at present.
Mrs. Ada Whiting
is the “Who’s Who”
of Melbourne minia-
turists. During a
period of nearly 20
years she has
tracked down almost
every local notabil-
ity and faithfully
reported everything
she could see. The
miniaturist’s art
tends to sweeten
dowagers and turn
aldermen to angels ;
but Ada Whiting
has never allowed a
sense of her sitter’s
importance to make
her merely compli-
mentary. .She has
“clone” Melba, Lady Brassey's daugh-
ter, Mrs. Ernest Brookes, Justice Hol-
royd, Captain Burnham, a flock of
Falkiners, and innumerable others. Mrs.
Whiting took to miniaturing on the advice
of Streeton, and two of her first efforts
found a refuge in the Royal Academy. The
artist is practically self-taught, a long pre-
liminary as a colorist for photographers
helping her to achievement in her special
domain. The photo is by Ruth Hollick.
The Agar Wynnes’ Easter shooting house-
party included two Governors. The G.-G.
was there for a day or two—-the second visit
to the Nerrin Nerrin station within a month.
Governor Stanley went up with genthelp
Conant. Mrs. Norman McArthur and the
young widow of A. J. Dudgeon were other
guests.
Dr. Ramsay Smith, exhausted with ’flu
work at the naval headquarters and sassiety
junketing everywhere, has gone on furlough
to see his people in another State. Young
Ramsay is a son of the S. Aus. Dr. Ramsay
Smith who made a name for himself in
Egypt when the wounded Anzacs were com-
ing back in shiploads from Gallipoli.
The French Red Cross is preparing to
wind up. There was a meeting last week
to gather up the threads.
The flying son of Coroner Cole has come
back from the war with a selection of
honors. lie wants to go in for flying in
Australia, but meanwhile is a gallant
figure on the Block.
Squatter George Riddoch, of S. Aus., who
died last week at 77, was well known in
Melbourne. He married a daughter of the
late James Yelverton Wilson, of Portland
Victoria’s pioneer parson. Mrs. Riddoch
died two or three years ago. James Boothby,
longtime of Dalgety’s, and the late Robert
Matheson, of Maryvale, each also married
a Wilson daughter. Daughter Adelaide, his
only child, married a Captain Napier, of
the British Army. She died, leaving Rid-
doch with a grand-daughter who will get
the old man’s wealth in a solid lump—an
amount estimated even by pessimists at over
a quarter-million.
Lieut. Frank O’Connor Twomey, who died
of wounds in France last October, left an
estate lately proved at £78,000. He had
Kolor, in the rich, stonv Penshurst district
fertilised by the neighborhood’s long-defunct
volcano, Mt. Rouse. His father was the late
Han Twomey, who owned Ivolor before him ;
and his mother was a handsome native-born
O’Connor. Racing-man Jack Twomey, who
died in Melbourne not long since—he was a
cousin—used to have Stonefield.
Among the young Scots who joined up
with the A.I.F. on the outbreak of war was
Donald Macdonald, of Lairg, an ancient
village which has provided the Western
District with a lot of its oldest sheep-
families. The late Thompson, of Monivae,
came thence, and so did the Munros,
McLeods, Mathesons and Mclnneses. Young
Macdonald had qualified for the kirk, but a
pre-war visit to Australia turned his
thoughts to other shepherding. Lately,
having seen the war through, Donald pulled
off a Kitchener agricultural scholarship,
which he will work off in England before
coming again to show us the proper way
to turn greenstuff into lamb-chops.
Bishop Maxwell-Gumbleton, of Ballarat,
expects to attend the Lambeth Conference
next year, but he has made it quite clear
that he is not resigning his Western Dis-
trict job to make the trip. Squatterdom has
been most kind to him since his arrival from
a humbler position in England; and the dear
bishop, in going back for a delicious flutter,
finds himself in the rare and happy state of
being able to eat his cake and have further
supplies on the shelf awaiting his return.
Capt. (Dr.) Alec Bennie died at Caul-
field Hospital last week. Before going to
the war he had been practising at Armadale
and previously at Berwick. In the latter
neighborhood the testimonial to his memory
is that, when called on to attend a patient,
“he always galloped his horses.’’ The late
Dr. Peter Bennie, well-remembered in Mel-
bourne as a children’s doctor, was a brother.
There is a flutter at Kinkora House, the
old mansion in Kinkora-road, Hawthorn,
Addie Kelly having surrendered herself to
Tom Rowan. She is the third and youngest
daughter of George Kelly, who, after build-
ing up one of the biggest engineering busi-
nesses in Melbourne, died a while ago, leav-
ing his girls well endowed. The groom is
a son of Mrs. Rowan of Mononia, Haw-
thorn, and of the late Chris Rowan, who
was associated with the late Aid. Moubray
a former Mayor of Melbourne, in the Mou-
bray, Rowan and Hicks house.
An Australian girl who married a rich
German, since interned, is now making
tracks for a divorce. Incompatibility of
country, or something.
Captain Ramsay, the good-looking young
man of the Naval Depot, has been celebrat-
ing the arrival of a young future admiral in
his home. Commander Keightly and his
biule gave a dinner-party, which consisted
mostly of toasts to the Ramsay heir.
A recent par anticipated the appearance
ot two of Harold Gaze’s books. “Copper-
,top t 0 startle the public next Decem-
ber; The Mite Merry” in August.
From a mourning “Rosna” in London:
Australians in Britain are the poorer for the pass-
ing on February 7 of Frances Fitzgerald Fawkner,
one of the ablest journalists among them and one of
the dearest of women. Old Bulletin readers will
remember her under her maiden name of Frances
Elmes: Later she was on the staff of the Argus, and
during the drought of 1902 did a big tour of the
Mallee. Her vivid pictures of what she saw there
brought in many thousands to the relief funds. For
. years she has been busy at journalism and maga-
zine work in this island, and for a good many of
them had been one of the chiefs of the British
Australasian staff. AH the writers and artist folk
and thousands of soldiers who have found that office
a friendly place will grieve for her death, for she
had great, wit and charm. Two years ago she pub-
lished her first book, “The Children at Kangaroo
Creek, a delightful yarn of Australian youngsters,
which is shortly to have a new edition.' Another
book of hers, recently finished, will appear this year.
Frank Williams is
a cl-wer South Aus-
tralian, now in Mel-
bourne, who was a
protege of Lady Gal-
way and of Melba.
He has written and
designed an Oscar-
Ascnean play, “The
Peacock.” and a new
type of languorous
ballet is one of the
delights. Williams
has _ another stage
creation ready, “The
Call of France.”
Both are to be shown
in Melbourne to help
the Children’s Hospi-
tal. Sassiety ama-
teurs will 'be in
charge. The author-designer, a Gallipoli
man, is bound for Europe before the year is
gone. Some of his work is to be produced in
. he has hopes of London, too.
Melba is very keen about the value of his
inspirations in color.
Adelaide’s week :
So far, we are not masked, hut ’flu is spreading,
and hardly a suburb is exempt. Many of the Adel-
aide Hospital staff have been smitten, and the Board
is advertising for women willing to render tem-
porary assistance at an “honorarium” of 255. a week.
Ihe quaint part is that the public, which reeked of
eucalyptus two months ago, is blandly ignoring the
whole business now, when the position is infinitely
worse.
1 lie Euripides brought back Houghton Swift, eldest
son of Dr. H, Swift, who has put in most of his time
since February, 1915, in Ruhleben. He was studying
engineering at the Siemens works when war broke
out, and was left in comparative peace till February.
Then his trouble started. Another ex-prisoner on the
same transport is Major J. J. Hughes, who had been
given up for dead, being unheard of for six months.
He was in hospital during that period.
Dr. 0. S. Mead and his wife and two daijghters are
back in Adelaide after 25 years in Bengal. Mead, a
son of old Dr. Silas, was once house-surgeon at
Adelaide Hospital, and then decided to devote him-
self to medical-mission work in India.
Major J. E. Barrett, this State’s first chief of the
Repatriation Department, has been transferred to
Melbourne. He fought on CJallijooli with the 3rd
Light Horse, and his military career dates from 1900,
when he joined the Mounted Rifles as a private.
J. F. Ward, a P.A.O. master, is leaving for Banana-
land to open a boys’ school at Charters Towers. His
wife and two children go with him.
The members of the Battalions Clubs took posses-
sion of the streets on Wednesday and sold apples and
roses on behalf of the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall appeal.
Major V. M. Newland was lunched by the Common-
wealth Club on Wednesday. He had some interest-
ing facts to give concerning the East African cam-
paign, in which he fought from the beginning—“when
every man who could carry a rifle answered the call
to arms” and joined up with sporting rifles and
“such ammunition as he possessed.”
The farewell concert to Clara Serena and her hus-
band drew a huge audience to the Town Hall on
Thursday evening. Clara’s encore numbers ran to
five, and she was half-smothered in flowers and part-
ing gifts.
An interesting law combination has been an-
nounced. Frank Fisher practised for years with
his brother-in-law Culross, after whose death Charlie
Pow'ers, son of the Federal Judge, came in as junior.
Young, Newland and Ward was a comparatively late
firm. The two juniors were sons of famous old
S.A. politicians. Fred Young took to politics him-
self, and quickly became Crown Minister and Agent-
General in London, and finally a knighted member of
the House of Commons. Newland (the international
wicket-keeper) having died young, Ward took a
junior, Jeffries. The firms now amalgamate as
Fisher, Ward, Powers and Jeffries.
The place of Professor Dr. Stirling on the Uni-
versity Council is filled by Dr. .T. C. Verco, affection-
ately known as “Uncle Joe,” and the admitted head,
unofficially, of the medical profession in Adelaide.
Not all nurses are Florence Nightingales.
One who had been engaged to nurse a young
wife, seeing that the patient was raving in
delirium with ’flu, hastily packed her bag
and fled, saying the case was no good to
her. A second nurse came, saw and left.
A V.A.D. who came to the rescue explained
to the husband that she would do pantry
work, but could not lend a hand in the sick-
room. For days the unhappy husband,
alone and unassisted, fought for his wife’s
life. She is now convalescent, but he is
critically ill.
Australian Thea Proctor learnt in Eng-
land that the woman artist in wartime has
a hard row to hoe. She doesn’t get sent fo
the Front, either to fight or to sketch the
fighters and paint war memorials. She can
go munitioning, or take the place of a fight-
ing man in some office; but she must leave
her art behind. And her spasms of leave
bring little consolation ; or they did not to
her. She struck an ideal furlough, as it
seemed—six weeks down in Cornwall, with no
air-raids and the most paintable scenery in
the United Kingdom. But when she got
there she found every kind of sketching for-
bidden to her. She had thoughtlessly for-
gotten to ask the Chelsea policeman for a
certificate of patriotism, or good moral char-
acter, or something. No other policeman
would do, and no local certificates of char-
acter cut any ice. So she just wandered
around disconsolate for six weeks under the
cold, suspicious eye of Cousin John.
The genial Westmacott has crossed to
Sydney in place of Taylor Darbyshire, who
has left J. C. Williamson, Ltd., and returned
to journalism.
The show was to have filled the stage
Majesty’s; but, so ’tis said, the
J.C.v\. people refuse to have a peacock in
their theatres. J.C. himself respected the
superstition in his time and would never
have a feather about the nlace. So the
King’s is to be the strutting-ground.
P- N. G. Grant, C. 8., I{.N. (now is it
any wonder he’s known as “the Alphabet”?),
our new admiral, is a bachelor, and only 52.
In view of the ages of some of the festive
grooms v/ho have tottered up the aisle re-
cently, this is almost infantile. The navy
is notorious for its capacity for affection;
and A. E. I. O. U. and sometimes W. and Y.
Grant may furl the red flag of his indepen-
dence before the battery of Australian eyes.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
DAVID
JONES
for
SMART
MILLINERY
F. S. Kelly is another who has added a
bloom to the chaplet of immortelles woven
by his soldier-brothers to the memory of
Rupert Brooke, poet and patriot. In his In
Memoriam Elegy, performed at the T. H.
Kelly home at Bellevue llill, the composer,
who himself, later, made the great sacrifice,
has faithfully reproduced the atmosphere
surrounding the poet’s burial. .He described
it in a letter from Egypt in 1915: —
We had a poet in our Battalion —Rupert Brooke.
Unfortunately he died a few days before we landed
in the Dardanelles, and we buried him in Skyros,
in a divine olive grove, where all the surroundings
put one back into a pagan atmosphere of pre-
Christian times. We were under orders to sail
early next morning, and as there was no time for
his burial except at night, we conveyed his body
up a wild, scented valley and held a service by
moonlight.
So in the early spring, when the young gods
wander down from Olympus, they will come
upon the cowslips of Devon and violets that
still keep the tang of the Channel spray ; for,
as Brooke himself has said, his grave is but
“a corner of a foreign field that is for ever
England.”
Mrs. Herbert, whose husband administers
justice through dry and wet seasons in
l’apua and once Yiceroyed in the Northern
Territory, is at the Metropole with her
daughter, Mrs. Leonard Murray. Life for
the women of Moresby takes on the simpler
aspects. No feminist movements, no domes-
tic problem (black brother saves that), and
never a milliner’s shop. “Shopping”—
which isn’t to be confounded with the pur-
chase of mere necessaries—is done through
the mail-order departments of city stores,
and Mrs. Herbert is enthusiastic over the
way the fluff firms attend to their end of the
business. Suede or kid gloves are the most
reckless luxury and the source of sleepless
nights to the owner, who wakes up to wonder
if the screw-top bottle in which she keeps
them is really and truly air-tight. The wet
season, which starts in November and ends
in April, makes gloves and veils unpopular.
In one minute a veil becomes a sodden thing
that sags at the tip of the nose. From
April to November a strong, cool wind blows
over the little Papuan capital, and though
the temperature seldom drops much below
95deg. one’s skin becomes dry and healthy,
and the unwary woman is tempted to invest
in alluring crepe de chine. But only once;
for she sees the fabric perish before her naked
eye. White cotton frocks, canvas shoes
and the panama are the apparel of the ex-
perienced woman all the year round; she
adds white cotton gloves to her summer
wardrobe, and feels she has guarded herself
against the rigors of winter.
Tennis is the great sport among the
90 or 100 white women of the Port.
Someone (possibly a Mac in the Burns-
Philp employ) started a golf links, but this
means a journey outside the town, so the
game languishes. The lucky women have
horses and ride. Evenings are taken up
with amateur theatricals and dancing; and,
of course, the music of the spheres is dis-
pensed by the übiquitous gramophone. The
piano doesn’t thrive, and the occasional
tuner is more fussed over than a crowned
head. Gardening isn’t popular, and Mrs.
Herbert, a rare enthusiast, sadly admits that
she has no luck with anything but tropical
plants.
Food? Well, yes, at Moresby it is mostly
tinned. There are occasional glad days
when an enterprising hotelkeeper, who runs
a freezing-chamber, has more meat than his
menu demands ; then, especially if the house-
keeper has managed to secure a pound or
two of cabbage (you buy fresh vegies. by the
pound in Papua), she feels she has achieved
one of life’s masterpieces. But a healthy
climate, in spite of the heat. And it has other
advantages. A town without a dressmaker
should appeal to men ; and a land running
over with marriageable men shouldn’t be in
the black books of the enterprising female.
Prince Alfred nurses, who went down one
after another while attending to ’flu
patients, get a fortnight’s leave to recuper-
ate ; and Dr. Gordon Craig’s bungalow at
Palm Beach, with Mrs. Craig as hostess and
matron, houses a jolly mob in various stages
of convalescence.
Last week Lady Davidson cast a maternal
eye over Chester, where the Red Cross nurses
and V.A.D.’s who contract the ’flu are
nursed. Mrs. Gordon Wesche was on hand
to warn off any Bolshevik germ that might
be inclined to familiarity.
Mr. and Mrs. Maiden were “at home” at
their residence in the Botanical Gardens on
Friday afternoon to "welcome Lieut.-Col.
1 )avid, Mrs. David and Molly. They invited
the professorial staff of the University and
their womenfolk to meet them; also the
committee of the Mining Corps Comforts
Fund. Miss Agnes Dove, Mrs. David’s oldest
friend in Sydney, was in the enthusiastic
party.
The Davids are staying with Miss
Sutherland in Bay-road while they look
round for a shack. The Prof, has an only
son, who did his bit with the Army Medical
Corps. His infant daughter has been
weighted with the names of Pamela Geral-
dine Margaret Edgeworth.
Mark Morton, M.L.A., who was married
quietly last week to Mrs. Anderson, is a
brother of Philip, the station-owner, and
Harry, the politician. On the South Coast
line, anywhere between Austinmer and
Nowra, he knows every farmer, farmer’s
wife and farmer’s employee that boards the
train or foregathers on the station.
“Banjo” Paterson and his wife are back
again. He went to Egypt in 1915 with the
original Methusaliers—the N. S. Wales Re-
mounts. They found their job a sinecure.
The evacuation of Gallipoli was imminent,
and, anyhow, no horses were needed for a
campaign in which the ftehting forces were
all the time hanging, as it were, to the edge
of a cliff. Later on, however, when the
Palestine campaign began, there was work
for the reconstructed unit to do in the way
of shipping horses and mules to the Light
Horse and Artillery. The camp was most
of the time at Maadi, a suburb of Cairo, and
the magnificence of the officers’ tents and
the splendor and comfort of their mess were t
the envy of all.
The Fay and Callaghan boot firms had
weddings last week ; and earlier in the year
the footwear McEvoys measured off the
almond icing for a cake. In each instance it
was a daughter of the house who paired off.
At Chatswood Freda, daughter of the J.
M. Callaghans, mated with Frank Bennett,
whose late doctor dad used to diagnose the
complaints of Morpeth. The bride was
radiant in tulle and silver lace and wore a
veil whereon a whole flight of butterflies dis-
ported. Four bridesmaids added a joyous
apparel of pink frocks and monster black
hats to the function.
On the same evening, Helen, daughter of
Mrs. S. A. Fay, of Mosman, frocked herself
in white tulle and Mechlin lace to rivet her
life-steps to those of Stanley Hubert Ravens-
croft of North Sydney. Two bridesmaids in
pink and pale blue played a small part; and
in the same scene Norman Chivers and Rex
Ravenscroft were cast as best-man and
groomsman.
The Belgian Consul and Mrs. Watteeuw
are busy on the soup of farewell and the ion
voyage cutlet. The Watteeuws will be missed
in many circles, and the south Coast next
summer will look in vain for the impressive
yellow beach-umbrella and the glittering
armory beloved of the Consul. The Expen-
sive Davidsons and the State Government are
amongst those who extended good cheer and
soft speech to them during the week.
Before cominsr to
Australia, Mr. Wat-
teeuw had been Con-
sul in China and
Asia Minor. Edu-
cated in Venders, his
birthplace, for five
years he studied law
at the University of
Brussels, and then
entered the Consu-
late at Ghent, where
lie received his first
appointment. He was
at the legation in
Constantinople when
the Balkan War was
raging and had many
thrilling experiences,
lie speaks of the 15
warships belonging
to the different countries lying in the bay
ready for action, and found it a most won-
derful tonic. All of Mr. Watteeuw’s male
relatives have fought in the war against the
Hun; his youngest brother was last year
killed and his eldest brother was for four
and a half years a prisoner of war.
The Belgians in Sydney, headed by Mr.
Verbrugghen, Director of the Conserva-
torium, met at Farmer’s on Friday afternoon
to say au revoir. The guest of honor was pre-
sented with a set of silver entree dishes,
and Mrs. Watteeuw with a silver rose-bowl.
Mr. Watteeuw departs from Sydney with
the title of Consul-General. His next
appointment, after a holiday in Belgium,
will probably be in South America. He will
be accompanied back to Belgium by a young
Australian —his son, who was born in Syd-
ney. His daughter is a native of Asia
Aunor, and his eldest son was born in
China.
Mr. Watteeuw’s successor as Belgian
Consul in Sydney is Mr. Henri Segaert.
Mrs. Rix Nicholas, one of whose chalk
drawings was purchased recently by the
French nation for the Luxembourg, was
entertained last week by Mrs. Sherwood at
the Women Painters’ Club, in Victoria
Buildings. Of course, because of the ’flu, the
party had to be of the smallest, but the fire
of enthusiasm burned high among those who
drank tea in company with the Melbourne
artist. Mrs. Rix Nicholas passes most of
her life in Paris, but at the moment she is
rusticating at Toongabbie.
The Women Painters’ Society is enrolling
members every week. Two of the newest are
Miss Rodway and Mrs. Ure Smith. The first
picture sold from the walls of the new rooms
was a sketch by Miss Booth.
Betty Solomons is fascinated with model-
ling, and purposes showing two bronze heads
in full relief at the Exhibition in August.
Mine-manager Harry Davies, one of the
innumerable host of Professor David’s young
men, who left off washing dividends out of
New England for a Melbourne co. to go with
the Engineers, is due home. He came via
America.
This is a May
Moore likeness of
Mrs. Cooper-Day,
caught in the rush
of the ’flu cam-
paign. The lady is
one of the Health
Department’s most
capable officials, and
so, the St. Stephen’s
centre having been
got under way, she
has been transferred
to the busy and
populous Newtown
depot. The St.
Stephen’s district is
small, but embraces
some of the poorest
slums of the city,
and here Mrs. Day’s
knowledge gained during her child-welfare
work was of immense benefit. She prides
herself on knowing every lane and turn-
ing of Sydney slum-land. In one lane
in Mrs. Day’s jurisdiction every tenant is
down with the disease. Crowded neighbor-
hoods, and the street the only playground
for the children, and the germ flourishes.
Ormond House is proving of inestimable
benefit m taking charge of uninfected
kiddies. Mrs. Day’s soldier-son is adding his
weight to his mother’s punch at her section
of the enemy.
The interesting people brought back by the
AnnpKks weren’t all professors and colonels,
ihere were in the big crowd that bowled into
the Anzac Buffet—Miss Evans still in com-
mand—on Friday a father and son who both
enlisted as privates—dad in 1915 ; the boy
in lDlts. When they returned dad was Cor-
poral Lee and the son, now 21, was a
sergeant.
Home by the Nevasa, which also brought
many discharged prisoners-of-war, Sister
lat ’ O’Connell, who joined in the long,
weary wait for Gallipoli, and, except for a
few months when she was lent to a Tommy
hospital, has been ever since mending her
beloved broken Diggers. Lately she has
been in charge of the “stumpies’ ” ward at
Southall, where most of the amputation
cases were sent.
Ex-Parliamentarian Frank Clarke is re-
joicing in the return of his second son from
the wars in the Bible Country. Another is
with the siege artillery in France. Trooper
Oliver was just on four years away, and
was lucky enough to escape a hit.
Homeward bound, Captain Jim Chapman,
son of Austin, and a Duntroon product. The
youngster has been four years absent, and
part of the time was on Birdie’s staff.
Sister. Bolton, a Victorian, came back on
the Ulimaroa last week, wearing the
. tricolor on her coat. She nursed
Billjim in Egypt for over three years, and*
finished up by comforting him in'the hospi-
tal staffed by our Billjemimas at Salonika.
Staff-paymaster Hore, who was lent to us
for the duration of the war, will leave for
England this week with his wife.
Arrived by the Euripides, Mrs. George D.
Macintosh, formerly Miss Shepherd Laidley,
of Sydney. Her surgeon-commander is with
Lord Jellicoe on the New Zealand. Lieut,
and Mrs. Thompson stepped from the same
ship. Mrs. Thompson was Miss Warren, of
Sydney. She went to England two years
years ago to marry her lieutenant.
Among the arrivals on the Derbyshire last
week was Major Roy Thompson, D. 5.0.,
M.C. He went away with the Fifth (F.A.)
Bugade, and had a brilliant career in
hrance until his right arm was blown off.
He is a product of Duntroon.
Another Fifth Brigade notability to get
back in the last few days is Major Ronnie
Osborne, M.C. After doing good work with
a Second Divisional Artillery Battery be
went on the General’s staff, bringing a capa-
city for business and knowledge of the law
to an environment where it is painfully
rare. In civil life he is a solicitor, and he
comes back to take up a partnership in a
prosperous firm of Sydney attorneys.
“Wally” Marks (who has been a naval
commander for the last four years) is ex-
pected back, with his wife, at the end of the
month.
Mrs. Erie Darley.—her husband is a
naval grandson of N. -S. Wales’s one-time
Chief Justice—arrived on the Euripides.
She used to be Edith Holdship, the pretty
daughter of Mrs. Harry Holdship and a
niece of the lady who was Mrs. Willie
Mitchell.
After playing innumerable couples down
St. Patrick’s aisle to the strains of Mendels-
sohn’s best-known march, organist William
Caspers is off to Albury to his own wedding
.with Kathleen Nyhan, of Thomond, Moun-
tain Creek. Singer Ella Caspers is lending
sisterly support.
Crow’s Nest, the old Ilay mansion on the
North Shore, is to be lent to a young soldier
for marriage purposes. His name is Itoy
Forrest, and he and his people are old
friends of the family. Major Forrest, the
prospective bridegroom’s father, had a place
near Coolangatta till shortly before his
death. Crow’s Nest has a wonderful old
garden, and the orchid house is among the
Best in the world.
On Easter Monday Memory Park was
opened at Hazelbrook in honor of that
mountain town’s soldier men. To do things
thoroughly the Hazelbrookers started at
half-past nine with a fancy-dress procession
and finished off with a concert at night, the
interval being filled with the planting of 70
honor trees in the new park and a luncheon
at which much speech went round. Captain
and Mrs. Carmichael helped the festivities
along.
Leila Prince, the Mosman girl who died
while doing voluntary nursing in the Woolloo-
mooloo sector, was a daughter of Mrs.
Henry Prince, who before her marriage was
a Fitz Stubbs —a sister of Maud. The
splendid girl was a good friend to all stray
canines, and the Dogs’ Home will miss her;
also several other organisations that give a
helping hand to the needy.
The dominie has done his bit, too. One
of him, Lieut. N. Ross Mearns, who was
science teacher at Sydney High, has been
promoted to a captaincy and saluted in
despatches for his work as a gas officer in
France. He is a son of the Hunter’s Hill
Mearns.
The Arthur Allens gave a dance at Meri-
oola last week. This is one of the few re-
maining houses in Sydney with a real ball-
room. and the floor is perfect. The Allens
bought the place from the C. E. Pilchers after
Mrs. Pilcher’s death. The Mortons, the child-
like and astonishingly clever Beith girl, the
Lumsdaines and a couple of dozen other
keen dancing girls were there; also such
expert masculine performers as the Levy
boys, Bob Rabett and Monty Stephen.
Frank Mitchinson, famous wherever
Rugby football is played, was married this
week at Wellington (M.L.) to a charming
girl—Cora Hendry. The man whose luck
is in gave Sydney some thrills on the plaving
fields in 1907 and 1910.
There comes a poignant appeal from the
Fruit and Vegetable Fund. The treasury
is almost empty, and, unless tnore pennies
are thrown in, the 500 soldiers’ families who
depend on the fund’s vegetables to eke out
the small joint will be in a sorry state. The
fund also runs a side-line in women’s and
children’s clothing, and it begs for prompt
donations in cash or kind.
The prettiest girl at Medlow the other
week-end was Miss Forsyth, daughter of the
big South Sea trader who lives most of his
time at Watson’s Bay. Mr. Forsyth made
a romantic marriage with an heiress in the
Islands, and the pretty girl and a younger
brother are the result. Mrs. Forsyth’s
Paris clothes and her genius for dressing
were one of the chief delights of the Hydro.
Ex-Governor Beauchamp—father of a fine
big family now—has struck trouble on the
home acres near Worcester. He had arranged
to auction some surplus pasturage, and the
tefiants were given six months’ notice to
quit. They showed their feelings at the
auction by singing “John Peel” (evidently
the recognised chorus when Hodge is an-
noyed), with the result that the seidlitz-
nowder landlord hurriedly ’phoned to stop
the sale.

Oxy-Acetylene Welding
keeps good machinery and
tools off the scrapheap.
STUDY these two examples of OXY=ACETYLENE WELDING
WORK, and realise what a vast power for economy the Oxy=
Acetylene Fusion Process is wherever there are broken tools
or broken parts of machinery.
Times out of number, after experienced engineers have shaken their
heads over a bad breakdown in machinery and almost committed the
owner to a big outlay for new parts, the Oxy=Acetylene Welder has
made the parts as strong as new in quick time, saving not only the
cost of new sections but incalculable delay.
There is no repair job too small or too large that the Oxy=Acetylene Welder cannot make
the broken section as strong as new for a trifle compared with the cost of new parts
It joins perfectly and accurately Cast and Wrought Iron, Mild Steel, Brass, Copper, Gunmetal and
Aluminium. There are Oxy-Acetylene Welders all over the country ready for your work.
Engineers and Garages can make money with an Oxy-Acetylene Welding Outfit. Factories, Steel
Works, Foundries, etc., can save big money by having one on hand. Metal and Sheet Metal
Manufacturers can produce better articles at a fraction of the cost by using the Oxy-Acetylene
Welding Blowpipe.
Illustrated Booklet fully describing the work of the Oxy-Acetylene
Welding and Cutting Process will be mailed on request.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character ) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Bon: Yes, but don't you see that you will
have had insurance cover for the period? You may
live for the 10 years; but there are plenty who
won’t, and their beneficiaries have to get the full
amount. It was a poor policy to take, all the same.
. ...P.J.T.: Strictly, perhaps, it ought to be “bun-
combe.” The lion, member for Buncombe County, in
North Carolina, was talking windy nonsense to the
House, and emptied it. Somebody drew his atten-
tion to the fact that nobody was listening. “Never
mind,” said he, “I’m talking for Buncombe.”....
A.E.M.: On the whole, bad hand-written MS. is
better than bad typed MS.: and the worst typed
MS. of all is the sort that leaves no space between
the lines.... Tim Buctoo: Infant story very aged....
G.C.: Will try to find out... .Bcllerive: Fine, parti-
cularly the finish: —
Rats scamper and squeak
And wade through the mud,
From where gallants fell
They’ll lap up the blood;
Upon ’em the soldiers
Fierce havie will play,
But the rats of the trenches
Will not keep away;
In hordes the trench rats
Through the sandbags will gnaw,
And add to the horrors of
The great thrilling war.
. ...P.J.V.: “Doggerel” all right, and a bad sample.
....Rex: Pretty rotten... .A.P.: There’s a thrill
in one line at least: “As sure as the life of the
future qnobs.”... .D.H.: Heart-rending cry fails to
move us... . Hopbooze: Ghost yarn can’t make a
whisker creep.... Haka: You have the joke all to
yourself... .8.N.: Doesn’t look or feel like “bread.”
Might be stale sandstone... .J.A.W.: We drowned
your bagman who “in a dam didst dive.”.... J. 8.:
Sorry; not up. ... A.H.L.: That island built for two
would be better under a crop of potatoes.... Sarg:
Nothing new on a very old subject... .A.L.P.:
Seems to be making a noise like a trowel.... D.N.:
Doesn't get anywhere near H.C.J.: Cob is a tedi-
ous person. You should have given him the poison
instead of the dog... .Cooyong: No use. Can’t think
how you got Sophie to stick to that bath. .. .Willie
Woodbine: Cheer up and try to forget it... .R.P.G.:
Those things have all been said 175,390 times before.
. ...A.G.P.: Not quite interesting enough to quote
as a shocking example T. 0.: You’ll have to
smooth the dark hair in some less critical place....
M.M.lt.: You have our Sympathy; but vve can’t do
with the smoky thing. .. .P.M.: As crude as a piece
of fresh whale blubber. .. .L.V.S.: Nothing in it
J.J.: That mule can’t eat the cash here J.C.:
Dull stuff, badly written. .. .O.B.: “Down with the
Bolsheviks” is a perfect joy:—■
Hear we are in Australia the best of lands,
A better land we could never seek ;
Leave it for Australians the best of brands,
To cut out all and all Bolsheviks.
Now these Bolsheviks are the worst kind of sex,
The world they’ll try to murder and mix;
The least to do is to string them by the necks,
To curb them so as they will have no plans to fix.
. ...G.M.A.: No use for that sort of loose stuff....
A.R.: No.. . .H.C.S.: No; doesn’t arrive yet....
A.J.M.: “Armistice” too commonplace... .N.:
Pretty enough; but had hardly sufficient strength to
flutter to the basket... . J.H.: The pra3 T er is in vain.
....Fayette: Well, that’s a wild whirling thing to
let loose while the 'flu is around... .Wattle: Afraid
you won't bloom this Spring. But don’t despair—
there’ll probably be another.... R.H.: Nothing in
the parody; and parodies have to be something
worth going a mile or two to hear L.W.: Fear
wc couldn’t get much sleep “in rest among the
blazing stars.” C.R.D.: You are 16 and write a
screed on “Life.” When you are 60 you’ll probably
produce a great poem on jam-tarts or some other
'subject dear to the philosopher who has really lived.
. ...A.8.N.: “Whine” won’t rhyme with “lime” in
this paper A.H.R.: The point is there; but you
don’t make it. .. .Cowrie: Heavy as lead T.J.R..
Sorry ; but the lumps and bumps are too plentiful.
• ...A.N.: Neither verse, prose, nor sanity.... Gipsy:
The Anzacs never deserved anything like that
W.P.L.: You can put in a lot of time .vet on the
sonnet form. . .Q. 8.: Please grow up... .T.H.C.:
Miles from home... .H.G.: Nothing new there....
1.M.1).: Held for consideration... .A.P.: “Menagerie”
won’t do.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
A.A.11.: That plough was specially invented by
Oswald Pryor. It’s patented and won’t be used at
any of the agricultural colleges.... W.: The nice
girl’s feet are too large and the doctor’s clothes
have been stolen from a navvy J.M.: No blokes
tan make bobs with such art. Try work.... Crowe:
Faulty drawing S.R.: Sad scratches R.E.: It
doesn’t meet with approval. Approval saw it
coming and rushed up a lane F.G.: Bristol board.
India ink and a little talent are the ingredients. .. .
John W.: Is your soldier administering a knock-out,
or merely massaging the wowser’s jaw? M.M.:

of bread, or is it her hat she is holding behind
her? V.H.: Don’t scorn perspective. He’s a

. ...R.K., Jr.: You are sentenced, to five years’
study. The newspaper-seller looks like an ancient
Egyptian... .H.C.McK.: Some promise in your line.
Try again....L.G.: Gag as old as the brewing trade.
J.D.: The truth must be told. You are no
cartoonist 0.A.C.: Unsuitable C.W.: None
to-day, thanks A.G.T.: Sunk with all hands.
“Emergency Nurse”: The nurses on the
best wicket at the moment are those who
have been retained by wealthy Sydney
families at five guineas a week for the period
of the epidemic, with a guarantee of seven
guineas a week if a case occurs in the house-
hold. There are a good many of them.
After long interval, the manufacture of
wire-netting has again been started by the
boarders at Pentridge. This time, Austra-
lian w ire is to take the place of the imported
goods previously used. The rods are to be
Newcastle-wrought and the wire drawn in
Melbourne. As the price of imported net-
ting is still about four times the pre-war
late, it should be good news to the rural
producer that the price of the Stockade net-
ting will probably be “substantially lower”
than that of the American article.

A Charming Countess Praises
Dr. Sheldon's Magnetic
Liniment
Mine. Edouard Drozdowski de Kurylo
is a charming American girl and a cousin
of the late Colonel Roosevelt. She has
I appeared with marked success throughout
| Europe and America as co-star and
i solo dancer with her distinguished hus-
band, Count Edouard Drozdowski de
Kurylo. The Countess is a firm believer
in Dr. Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment, and
would use no other, and she never loses an
opportunity of recommending this wonder-
ful Liniment to her many friends. She
writes as follows: —
What a magnificent Liniment for
the limbs and muscles your Dr.
Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment is! I
wouldn’t be without it for the world.
I have tried many so-called lini-
ments,, hut seldom with any good
effect. Many of them cause real in-
jury to the skin by scalding, burn-
ing and stiffening it. The beauty
of Dr. Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment
is its softness and kindness to the
flesh, nerves and muscles. I use it
before and after exercise. It makes
the muscles supple, so that the
hardest work will not cramp them.
In short, it is the only thoroughly
satisfactory liniment I have ever
come across, and I shall never again
be without it.
If it will he of service to you,
please use my letter, as I would like
others to benefit as I have done.
I remain,
Yours truly,
(Sgd.)

BANISHES ALL PAIN.
Pain in any form, be it Neuralgia, Rheumatism, or Sore Muscles that pain if you
so much as move —all these pains, and more, are easily controlled by Dr. Sheldon s
Magnetic liniment. Not an internal remedy, but working through the pores, of the
skin. Dr. Sheldon’s Magnetic liniment penetrates—goes into the seat of pain—and
banishment is the result. Apply the liniment with the palm of the hand—rub until
the friction creates a warm glow, and the pain leaves you as if charmed away,
life should not be spoiled by pain and suffering, when Dr. Sheldon’s Magnetic
liniment is rea-dy to relieve all aches and pains. The ever-ready family remedy.

My Brute.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOU’RE all mine now.
And ne’er again my aching breast
will throb .
Tith love's vicissitudes; now nought
may rob
Mv senses of the rhythm of their king.
1 was not made to love some puerile thing
For sake of sex. Mv being craved a Man,
Virile and strong: this was my heart s whole
plan.
And you’re mine now.
You lie in sleep, .
And I, beside you, feel your burning breath —
Put for its fervor you would seem in death,
So straight and tense your limbs are.
< Death? what fears
May come to sting me through the passing
years!)
But now I have you, heart and soul and
power.
(’Twere recompense to hold you for one
hour.)
My hero, sleep!
.Your red, red blood
Is singinsr with the rhythm of hot life
Some battle-song to stir the soul to strife,
Some daring, mocking lilt or stubborn lay
As that which held Horatius at bay,
And all my being warms in symphony,
Till I feel swinging through the heart of me
Your burning blood.
You wrestled once
In test of strength and skill with mighty
men;
I saw you lose your footing, love, and then
Seem like to have been vanquished ; but you
set
Your teeth, your blazing eyes flashed out,
“Not yet!”
Your muscles stiffened with an added
strength,
And him that was your foe you laid his
length.
I saw this once.
I named you Aian.
But, God! you are a Brute, a strong, strong
Brute!
That heavv brow holds memories of loot
And lust and slaughter of some era dead
When you had Simian claws; that well-set
head
Was moulded in some neolithic time,
When strength was virtue, and to slay Ho
crime.
My strong Brute-Man !
Your stubborn jaw
Was chiselled in an age Pleistocene
By poignant hates and loves that knew no
mean
But consummation swift. Your arms are
browned
(With what significance the hair bends round
From wrist.to elbow!) God! I hate you
now!
I hate your strong embrace, your heavy
brow,
Your dogged jaw!
I cannot hate,
When all the Woman in me loves and thrills,
I or I was fashioned to the whims and wills
Of all the sensuous Brutes that moulded me;
With some dull instinct of polarity
They made me lissome-limbed, and soft, and
fair,
And taught me how to love —this was my
share.
How can I hate?
You’re dreaming, love.
You start, your thin lips move, you clench
your hand.
Some psychic power I cannot understand
Directs your spirit. May some daring quest
Of aeons past be stirring in your breast,
Some spark surviving?—Or some pristine
hate
For one that stole your soft, primeval mate?
Keep dreaming, love!
I am content.
My altruistic soul has had its say,
And now my sensuous self resumes its sway;
for there’s the Brute in me that will not die,
But cries with every pulse. (And tell me
why
The Brute should not survive.) My love
holds strong,
Strong as your heart and limbs, love ! Right
or wrong,
I am content.
VICTORIA.
AME PERDUE.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
man knows what he will do under
{the influence of terror, neither can
he anticipate how or when terror
will confront him. To some it is a
spectre that haunts all their days, and to
others it comes but once or twice in a life-
time. How it may come, or when, a man
does not know. Whether it will find him a
man or a coward he does not know either.
uo me it came on the morning of January
10, 1807, in the old gaol at the foot of the
Rocks in Sydney, where I was lying under
sentence of death for the slaying of Black
Torn Considine, the overseer of the timber-
gang that worked in the woods behind
Sirius Cove, on the north shore of Port
Jackson. And it found me less of a man
than I thought I was, and has left me with
a remembrance of a weakness that I shall
not cease to loathe and execrate, until my
time comes again to face that which I feared
to face on that morning, and cannot escape.
I was resigned to die. for I knew well
when I took the axe to that wretch, Black
Tom most cruel and inhuman of all
the slave-drivers of the Settlement —that I
would swing for it, and my misery in the
two years since my transportation had been
such that even a shameful death upon the
gallows was no deterrent to what none of
us considered any crime at all. I had
parted from the world of living men when
Ile t the dock at the Old Bailey. The exist-
ence through which I had passed since was
worse than death. I did not fear to die.
That was what I thought—but I did. To
my everlasting shame, I did.
On the eve before I was to suffer, Sam
Davies, the gaoler, came to my cell, and
looked at me for a few moments without
speaking. He seemed to study me curiously,
and I grew a little restive under the stare
of his goggle eyes, which were protuberant
and fish-like from much drinking. Presently
he spoke.
“Ye’re a young man, Martin,” he says.
“Now, how old would ye be- —arskin’ par-
don for me impart’nince V”
“Please yourself,” says I.
“Nay, lad”—he made an impatient ges-
ture with his open hand—“don’t ’ee be short
wi’ me. ’Tis a kindness I’d do ye—d’ye
mind now.”
“Well, then, if ’twas not for to-morrow,
I’d see 30 come Michaelmas,” I told him.
“But why? Why do ye wish to know my
age?”
lie said nothing for a while, but only
gaped at me with his gooseberry eyes, his
thick lips parted, and his mottled face glis-
tening with sweat, for it was hot and close
in that foul prison, and I was myself stew-
ing in my own stinking perspiration. He
took a step into the little cell, and came
close up to me.
“Look ye, Martin,” he says in a low tone,
“are ye tired of livin’?”
“I haven’t been living these two years
gone,” I says. * “Ye don’t call it life, Mr.
Davies —what we endure in the gangs—do
ye?” I laughed with the bitterness of my
remembrance of that 20 months of Hell, to
escape from which I had split Tom Consi-
dine’s thick skull, thinking myself lucky in
the chance.
“Oh, come now,” he says. “How’d ye
like th’ charnce to live free —an’ respected,
in a good position?” he says.
I studied his fat face curiously. Was
the fellow planning my escape? Had some-
one bribed him to do that? ’ No, it could not
be so, for I had not a single friend in the
colony. He was jesting with me. ’Twas
a sort of cat-and-mouse humor it pleased
him to indulge himself with.
“Oh, to Hell with you !” I said. “Are ye
brute enough to make play with a dying
man?”
“Listen !” he says. “Ye know Ilounds-
ditch Billy?”
“I know him by sight,” I replied. “I’ll
know him better in the morning, no doubt.”
William Kermode, known as Houndsditch
Billy, was the hangman.
“Well, Billy’s ’ad a stroke —through th’
drink —an’s snuffed it.”
“Is that all you want to tell me?”
“No —not all. There’s another covey to
suffer wi’ you to-morrow —an’ no one to do
it on yez. Mr. Gore he’s in a rare fix.
Not sure but ’e’ll ’ave to turn ’angman
’isself. So ’e’s bin to Billy Bligh, an’ put
it to ’im th’ ’angman’s a vallyble orf’cer, as
cawn’t be did without, an’ would ’e give
one o’ you two coveys a pardon, condishnal
’pon a-takin* on th’ job on good be’avior?
So there it is for ye! Mr. Gore ’e sends
me a note, a-tellin’ me to put it to either of
ye. I puts it to the other covey—-an’ ’e’ll
’ave nowt of it. Curses me bitter, an’ axes
me wot I takes ’im for? ’lgh an’ mighty,
’e is. Stiffen me—proper hindignant.
‘You tell ole Gore to git •, an’ do ’is
own dirty work,’ ’e says. Now ’ere’s yer
charnce, Martin. Wot says you? A long
life, an’ a merry one—ye’ll be free at th’
end o’ y’r ’riginal sentence —or a dawnce on
nothink i’ th’ mornin’. You take my tip,
an’ live a w’ile longer. No call for ye to
die young. ’Tis a heasy, pleasant job, an’
ye’re a public character —quite looked hup
to, in a manner o’ speakin’. Now then —•
wot’s it to be?”
“You can tell the Provost-Marshal to go
to the Devil!” I says bravely, and would
talk to him no more. He sighed and
grunted, and presently went away.
And then I was left to the terrible dark
night—and myself. All through the long
hours I yearned for light, and there was
nothing around me but blackness —and the
morning light would bring eternal blackness.
In the prison proper—the two long wards
for men and women —drunken singing went
on until after midnight, and the abandoned
females screeched obscenity and curses, that
were answered in kind, to the men close at
hand. Towards the dawn there was no
sound, save the clanking of my irons, as I
moved restlessly about the cell. At last
sunbeams stole through the little grated win-
dow, and, with a sudden sinking of the
bowels, I realised that my time was nearly
come.
I know not how others would have endured
it, but this I know—that those rays of light,
shining through the bars, unmanned me
utterly. I broke down and wept, grovelling
upon the floor. In my deep abasement I
cried out: “O my God —give me the chance
again !” Even as I did so my prayer was
answered. The lock grated and the door was
opened, and there stood Mr. Gore —pale and
anxious-looking. I was conscious that I
crawled across the flags, and clasped him by
the knees. Behind him stood the gaoler,
grinning.
“Ask him now, y’r Honor,” he said. “He’s
thought better of it.”
“Charles Martin,” said the Provost-Mar-
shal, “will ye consent to be executioner—for
a free pardon?”
“O _ God. yes,” I cried. “O my God —
anything. Let me come to the light, sir. Ah,
God —give me air and sunshine !”
My prayer for light was answered as my
prayer for a renewal of that dreadful offer
had been. Outside the gaol the sun blazed
in all the brilliance of a cloudless sky, and
the village of Sydney, the blue waters of the
harbor and the distant wooded hills beyond
were bathed in sunshine.
But my soul was sick and heavy, and, as
I write this, forty-five years afterwards, I
can recall, almost with the present feeling of
-it, the deadly nausea that overcame me as I
looked at the tall poles of the gallows, and
the black cross-beam with two noosed ropes
dangling from it. that stood on the edge of
George-street, without the gaol.
I had been taken into the gaoler’s office,
and there the Provost-Marshal—who seemed
infinitely relieved by my compliance with
his desires —plied me with brandy and in-
structions as to the performance of my horrid

Maße Zam-Buh a Daily Need.
ACCIDENTS will happen even in the best=regulated families. Healthy
youngsters seem to be always “in the wars.” Housework abounds
with mishaps for busy wives and harassed mothers; and the bread=
winner often returns from work with a more or less serious injury. Just
what every home needs is Zam-Buk. A pot and a bandage on a handy shelf where they are handy
for instant use save untold pain, time and money. When the little one runs in from his play with
dirt - filled s. cr ‘ l Pe on his knee, simply wash the part and smear with
Zam-Buk. When father cuts or scrapes his hand, the handy pot of Zam-Buk again meets the emergency

NEARLY SCALDED TO DEATH.
Mrs. G. Green, of 75 Thomas Street, Oam-
perdown, Sydney, says:—“My little son
John upset a kettle of boiling water over
himself and was nearly scalded to death.
All the skin was removed and the flesh pre-
sented a painful, raw appearance. For
nine months he was in terrible agony. Zam-
Buk was very cooling and soothing, and
allayed all the symptoms of dangerous com-
plications. We continued with Zam-Buk
until thn wounds were completely healed.”
FESTERED ANKLE.
Mrs. Annie Lower, 80 Australia Street,
Aevvtown, writes: —“I bruised mv ankle, and
the dye from the stocking getting into the
wound caused it to fester and inflame. I
tried poulticing and everything else I could
think of, but nothing seemed to do it any
good. It was in a dreadful state when I was
induced to try Zam-Buk. The first applica-
.on of the balm eased the pain, and con-
tinued treatment drew out all the inflamma-
tion. cleansed the wound of all bad matter,
and resulted in perfect healing.”

Mrs. J. Boyle, of 12 Gipps Street, Balmain,

left hand to the bone. My finger became
inflamed, and the pain I suffered was dread-

wished me to have my finger taken off, as
there was a tendency for the poison to spread
up the arm. At last the inflamed condition

advice, when a friend recommended Zam-Buk.

office, until he deemed that I was well enough
stimulated with both to carry out the duties.
“Come ye now, Martin,” he said, “ ’tis
time to tie the prisoner up.”
He handed me a short length of cordage
for a lashing, and signed to me to follow him.
With the gaoler and a couple of constables
we went back to the cells. A door that was
two removed from the hole I had occupied
was opened—and there I beheld, smiling and
ready for us, the man whom, of all others, I
most hated !
It was him to whom I owed the ten years’
transportation that had landed me in New
South Wales—this infamous betrayer of my
friendship and my honor. Almost, my heart
stopped beating when I saw him standing
there, his false smile—half a sneer, and half
a greeting—mocking my misery. He it was
who had stolen my wife, and for whose
wounding I had suffered exile into this land
of felony and villainy. God! It was
strange—to encounter him in such circum-
stances !
And, suddenly, I remembered what I was
to do to him, and I felt wickedly and hid-
eously rejoiced. The horror of the loath-
some deed that I was to do in a few moments
fell from me. To kill him, in this most
abominable fashion, to regain my liberty by
doing the one thing above all others I had
wished to do—heavens above! If the Fates
had wished to recompense me for my suffer-
ings they could have chosen no better way
of doing it!
“I am ready, your Honor,” lie said firmly
to Mr. Gore, though his voice was low, and
he spake in a curious mumbling fashion, as
it he had something in his mouth.
“Knock off his irons, Saunders,” said the
Provost-Marshal, and the constable came
forward, with hammer and chisel, who had
not long before done the same for me in
Sam Davies’s room.
“Mr. Gore, sir,” said my victim in his
strange fashion, as of one who spake with a
mouthful of food—“ Mr. Gore, your Honor, I
trust that all has been arranged to hand my
body over to my friends, so soon as I have
ceased to suffer? As Was granted their re-
quest by his Excellency. Ye’ve seen to it,
your Honor?”
“Make your mind easy, Latimer. Ye’ll
be cut down so soon as the surgeon gives the
word, and given over to them. They are
waiting outside with the coffin now. Come,
Martin, tie his hands behind him. Good—
I see ye’ve regained your nerve, man. ’Tis
nothing. I've seen a hundred handled.
Latimer —d’ye wish to see my warrant?”
He took a folded paper from his pocket,
and held it toward the nrisoner, who waved
it aside.
“No, no. Mr. Gore. I know it is all
regular and in order —if you have the doing
of it. Come —I am ready.”
Speedily I had lashed Lis wrists together
behind his back, straining the knots that I
might hurt him. He winced a little, but
said nothing. Always, however, his smile
seemed to mock my vengeance.
As I have said, the aspect of the grisly
instrument of the calling to which, in return
for it, I had dedicated the remainder of my
life, sickened me miserably; but T was
allowed no leisure to indulge my weakness.
As we came out into the open, Mr. Gore
whispered hoarsely to me:
“Now waste no time, Martin. Get it
over quickly. Into the cart with him. He
is not going to address the crowd. Come —
hurry.”
Close to the wall a two-wheeled cart to
which a horse was harnessed stood ready to
convey the prisoner beneath the fatal beam.
A couple of steps were behind it, and up these
I assisted John Latimer, whereupon a con-
stable led. the horse to a position underneath
the gallows.
As we stood up in the cart we overlooked a
dense and motley crowd which filled the
street. They roared when they saw us, and
at once I understood that they execrated and
reviled the man who had bought his life m
the expense of his decency.
There was a hush as the cart stopped be-
neath the beam, and the people waited for
the dying man’s customary oration. He
bowed in the coolest manner and shook his
head. Instantly, the hoax-se uproar broke
out again. Hisrh above it, some man with a
bull's voice shouted, “Mark the cur!”
A deep groan of hooting broke out, and con-
tinued whilst I was in the cart.
“Hurry, man —hurry!” cried Mr. Gore
from the ground. I seized the noose and
went to adjust it about my enemy’s neck.
He shrank away a little.
“Charley,” he mumbled. “I’ve wronged ye
greatly. But don’t punish me. For God's
sake spare me suffering. Pull my legs—for
the love of God, pull my legs when I am
swinging.”
My bitter hati-ed of the man who had
ruined me flared out on the instant.
“By God,” I hissed in his ear, “I’ll give
ye no help, if it takes an hour to kill ye. I
pray that ye may suffer in Hell as ye’ve made
me suffer. To Hell with ye!”
I tightened the noose and climbed out of
the cart. “Git up !” cried the constable —
and my enemy slid from the moving vehicle
and dangled at the end of the rope. My
own empty noose swung in the breeze beside
him.
A few times he drew up his knees, and the
movement twisted him round to face me.
His eyes were closed ; but, to my horrox*, he
opened them and glared at me. And I
nearly dropped where I stood when he
grinned and winked.
* * * *
As I crouched over my fire that evening,
in my little hut by Palmer’s Cove —whicli
now they call Woolloomooloo Bay—a-tliink-
ing and a-thinking, and abject in miserable
contrition for the fearful manner in which
I had damned my immortal soul, there came
a muffled knocking that started me from
my bitter reverie and filled me with vague
fears.
“Who—what is itV” I cried, with a dry
throat and a tongue that could scarce fulfil
its office.
“A friend,” came a murmured answer.
“Open the dooi’, Charley, man. ’Tis naught
ye’ve to fear. Open, man—open !”
Tremblingly I unbarred the door —and
v as at once seized by two or more pair of
strong arms, my head and face muffled with
a cloth, and was urged away into the night.
Half dead with fear, I stumbled along for
a mile or more, my captors saying nothing,
and half lifting, half dragging me with them
over some rough pathway that sometimes led
through dew-drenched grass.
At last I cornu hear the splash of water
close at hand, that lapned upon a rocky
shore; I was lifted into a boat, held down on
my face below its thwarts, and, after some
minutes of muffled rowing, hauled up some-
thing steep that I knew, from the smell of
tar and bilge-water, must be a ship’s sirl .
“Have ye got him?" I heard a woman's
low and eager voice. "Bring him in, then.
Bring him in—Jack’s ready for him.”
T was pushed along the deck, and entered
a place that was warm and smelled of spirits
and tobacco-smoke. A sound of voices
ceased as they bustled me in, and my head
struck a beam.
“Now!” said the woman, and someone
plucked the scarf from about my face, so
that I could see where I was.
In a blaze of light sat the man whom I
had slain that morning—leering and grinning
at me, and alive!
A strange picture to rememoer, that was.
The long, low ship’s cabin hazy with tobacco-
smoke, and dim save where John Latimer
sat by the table, with the light of four
candles shining on his pallid face. His neck
was bare, and the bruise of the rope ringed
it in a ghastly fashion. Beside him stood
my wife, with that smiling sneer upon her
handsome face that I knew well. All anout,
in the shadows, were grinning men. Drink-
ing vessels of all sorts, and bottles, were
upon the table, and the remains of a meal.
Churchwarden pipes were in the mouths of
many. It had the appearance of some
strange supper of welcome to the dead man
whom I had seen coffined and carried off that
morning from the gallow’s. He waved his
hand feebly to me, and there was a bubble
of laughter all round the dim place.
My wife began. I had not known that
she was in the colony, no more than that
John Latimer himself was, until I had been
called upon to bang him. Hatred and con-
tempt were in h'r looks and in her words.
“Ye miserable wretch!” she taunted me.
“Ye’d save yer dirty life by taking his that’s
worth a regiment of such as ye. Kill him,
Jack —Mil him. He’s yours now.”
I could not get it into my head but with
difficulty that the pale, suffering man whose
ghostly features of death had been in my
mind all day, was other than a dead man.
Indeed he looked like a corpse who had been
awakened by some miracle for a temporary
purpose—a purpose that was sinister. His
right arni lay upon the table, and his hand
toyed with a. strange little silver instrument
that looked like some contrivance of surgery.
He raised his hand in a weary gesture
commanding silence. Then he beckoned her
to him. and whispered, evidently with pain
and difficulty, in her ear.
“Come here.” she Anns- at me. “Tie wishes
to speak with ye.” The two who had me
in guard shoved me close up to him. and I
leaned over to hear what he had to say.
He spoke, with many pauses, in which a
spasm of pain would flit across his pallid
countenance. His throat was bruised and
puffy about the dark mark of the rope.
Little blood-vessels seemed to have burst
beneath the skm. and his shaven chin and
jaws were intricate with their interlaced pat
terns. He grinned at me all the time, and
his body shook with laughter. Ills head
was held stiffly, as if the slightest movemen;
of the neck gave him pain. And well u
might have done.
“So, Charley,” he whispered, “so v
thought—thought ye’d finished me off—thi<

your face—just now. Worth anything

He held un the little silver thing, dose t<

It was a tube, perhaps a little over four
inches long, and less than one in diameter.
