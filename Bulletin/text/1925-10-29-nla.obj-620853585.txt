The New Movement in Art
The recent exhibition of Rupert Bunny s
“New Movement” landscapes gives us sor-
rowfully to wonder whither art is drifting.
What are we coming to next? If this be
Modern Art, then modern art is mere hum-
bug ; worse, remembering what art stands
for in the past, it is blasphemous. If this
be the final and modern expression of art,
then art is nearly on the rocks. It reveals
a pitiless contempt for established conven-
tions, a pitiful attempt to set up new stand-
ards. It discloses a predilection for the
theatrical, the bizarre, the hysterical; in
short, for everything that art is not. The
New' Movement artists hurl their conceptions
at you, and they hurt as though they were
bricks. It is indiscretion unveiled —artistic
indecency almost —possessing neither re-
straint nor vraise mb lance, neither romance
nor message. But worse than all, it is not
Truth. One asks oneself incredulously can
New Movement artists possibly delude them-
selves into believing what is not the truth in
art? It all presupposes vacuity of expres-
sion, goes so far as to suggest paucity of
knowledge. Yet we know it is not that.
Therefore it must be either deliberate self-
deception or subconscious hypnotism.
New Movement artists riot in the extrava-
gance of their conceptions, with the result
that their art shrieks at you from the walls,
hardly sometimes stops in the frames in the
exuberance of its determination to demand
attention. It insists upon your notice by the
mere strength of its clamor. It challenges
your judgment and inevitably evokes a tirade
of criticism. Contrast the calm dignity, the
quiet confidence, the simplicity—the repose
—of the Masters! You approach them on
tiptoe. You discuss them in reverential
whispers. They lure you, grip you, over-
whelm you, spiritually and intellectually,
with their quiet insistence. But these stormy-
petrels of art—you shout back at them, plead
with them, expostulate, scoff at them even,
convinced that they are trying to “put one
over on you,” indignant that they should
have the temerity to put such insult upon
your intelligence!
Compare the work of New Movement
artists with the best landscape work done
in Australia —that of Streetou and Heysen.
That is the test. Apply it, and New Move-
ment art looks as ridiculous as a nannygoat
in feathers. They are as children groping in
the dark for new light. They are hungry
and thirsty for new ideals. But you cannot
have new ideals in art. Art is eternal.
Always was, always is, always will be. It
is Truth. There is only one Truth, and the
artist is the high priest. You cannot find
new ideals, but you may find new subjects,
new technique—new ideas—within the limits
of sincerity and conviction. Let us concen-
trate on that. Let us grope through the
darkness until we find light. But let us
make no degenerate step, no step back to
the schoolroom.
Yet this is precisely what these New Move-
ment artists have done —gone back to the
kindergarten stage of art; thrown ideals to
the four winds of Heaven. Anyone can ex-
press art in terms of crude color; can splash
color about amazingly and astonish the
world. But whom the gods love they have
endowed with a delicate color-sense, with
sensibility to use color generously, as Nature
uses it. And harmoniously—not make a
comic song of art. The true artists will
starve upon that kind of pabulum. It nour-
ishes him not at all. In order to get your
relative values, your contrasts, your effects,
it may be necessary to exaggerate. It will
be necessary to simplify. But exaggeration
should not exceed reasonable limits, should
not overstep the borderland of sanity in art;
should not violate Truth. Above all things,
we must preserve artistic sanity. If you
allow unlimited license God knows where you
will drift. Discard as many conventions as
you are able to, there still remain conven-
tions which you neither can nor dare elimi-
nate.
The painter’s craft, like every other craft,
has fallen away from grace. We are satis-
fied with too small achievement. Artisti-
cally it is a decadent age, a barren age
almost; the age of the potboiler. Wo are
content to paint for to-day, not for posterity;
for dollars, not for Art’s sake. Sufficient
for the day is the sketch thereof. We are
too lazy or too decadent to put enough
groundwork into our art. We are slick,
certainly, and extol the element of dash,
while we deprecate that of infinite pains.
Slick slap-dash work has dethroned the art
of thoroughness. Mere cleverness counts for
more than knowledge and power of expres-
sion. It is the taint of the times. Not only
in art but in commerce and industry we
trace the gospel of superficialism. It per-
meates all things to our undoing. Even your
bootmaker has it, and your carpenter. To
expect that _ art might escape the general
degradation is to be too optimistic.
In New Movement art one vainly searches
for poetry, for romance. There is a con-
scious disdain of atmosphere. Yet without
atmosphere art expresses nothing, means no-
thing, is not creative. llow can it be crea-
tive lacking imagination? The outward like-
ness to the subject is easy. The inward
spirit is a totally different matter. With the
Masters—Rembrandt, Velasquez, Reynolds,
Whistler —art was not a business. It was
a Creative joy, a religion, a sacrament. They
worshipped at the shrine of art, with a
devoutness that was justified by tbeir achieve-
ment.
It is not sufficient for an artist, in the
endeavor, however sincere, to break new
ground, to adopt a pose, however fantastic,
and hope to “get away with it.” The study
of art should be approached in a spirit of
reverence, not in a spirit of levity and with
a flourish of trumpets. It must be a sincere
attempt to express the spirit of Nature;
must be conviction; not merely grotesque oi-
freakish individual expression of intellectual
idiosyncrasy. Such sometimes comes peril-
ously near to mere nightmare; never to sin-
cere art. And there is only one kind of art,
and that is sincere art. Without sincerity
it is not art but mere speciousness.
W. M. W.
The Novelist as Dramatist
The writing of stories and the writing of
plays, as many eminent workers in the nrst-
named field have discovered, are two vastly
different things. The novelist is at liberty
to roam at will, giving, if he chooses, pages
of description to his characters aud to their
environment. His tale may take many forms.
According to the writer’s ability it will be
equally effective told in straightforward nar-
rative style, in a series of letters, as a diary,
or, as with Kipling’s “Story of the Gads-
bys,” in dialogue only. It may, again, com-
prise a succession of detached sketches
joined together by a shred of plot.. And the
author is not rigidly bound by considerations
of length. In short, the novelist is subject
to ho arbitrary rules. But in the making
of a play there is a subtle technique to be
studied. Character must be suggested by
dialogue, the only medium of stage expres-
sion. Discursiveness is dangerous; redun-
dancy fatal. Every word uttered should
have some bearing on the plot, or at least
should assist in keeping the story alive. And,
finally, the time taken to perform the com-
pleted play must not, under ordinary cir-
cumstances, exceed three hours, including
intervals.
Craftsmanship, then, is the governing factor
in the work; and after a long experience of
the theatre I am satisfied that no author,
novelist or otherwise, goes through the
drudgery of writing a play solely in the
cause or art. The beginner may be advised,
therefore, to learn first of all how to “jino
his flats” and generally start the job in a
workmanlike manner.
It is interesting to consider what novel-
ists who have essayed the two mediums have
had to say regarding their experiments in
play-making. I know of one only who spoke
lightly—and, I suggest, unthinkingly—of the
task; and that is Arnold Bennett, This pro-
lific and highly-competent word-spinner, who
has tried most forms of literary composi-
tion, once confidently remarked: “There is
an idea abroad.... that it is more difficult
to write a play than a n0ve1.... I am con-
vinced that it is easier. Personally, I would
sooner write two plays than one novel”
(“The Author’s Craft”). That was written
shortly after Mr. Bennett had scored a very
pronounced success with his comedy “The
Great Adventure,” which, it is worth while
recalling, the author adapted from his own
clever story, “Buried Alive.” It would be
interesting to know whether he still holds
the opinions quoted. He has produced
nearly a dozen pieces since “The Great Ad-
venture,” but none has made any marked
impression. On reconsideration he might
put the matter thus: “It is not so easy to
write plays; it is easy not to write good
plays.”
In one of Robert Louis Stevenson’s letters
to his father occurs the canny sentence:
“The theatre is a gold-mine; and on that I
must keep my eye,” But R.L.S., the born
romancer and stylist, made no headway as a
playwright. We are told that “his lack of
interest in the living theatre, his unwilling-
ness to learn what every successful drama-
tist from the time of iEscliylus has had to
learn, may suggest a reason for his failure.”
His “Beau Austin,” “Macaire” and others,
in which W. E. Henley collaborated, are too
“literary.” There is much talk and little
movement. Literature that is merely words
is never of any account as drama.
speak louder than words” on the stage.
Other story-writers have realised the diffi-
culties to be met with, qnd candidly admitted
their inability to surmount them. Said Mark
Twain: “The greatest of all arts is to write
a drama. It is a most difficult thing. It
requires the highest talents possible and the
rarest gifts.” Twain spoke from his heart.
He had labored enthusiastically at the mak-
ing of several stage works, only to find that
when they were presented behind the foot-
lights they were never so “real” or effective
as his books.
Henry James, who had great ambitions in
the direction of play-writing, got to the root
of the matter. His letters contain frequent
references to the hard road he had travelled.
Here is one instructive, invaluable excerpt:
“The fine thing in a real drama, generally
speaking, is that, more than any other work
of literary art, it needs a masterly structure.
It needs to be shaped and fashioned and laid
together, and this process makes a demand
upon an artist’s rarest gifts. He must com-
bine and arrange, interpolate and eliminate;
play the joiner with the most attentive skill •
and yet at the end effectively bury his tools
and his sawdust and invest his elaborate
skeleton with the smoothest and most polished
integument.”
As advice to aspiring dramatists this could
hardly be bettered. Those practised crafts-
men James M. Barrie and John Galsworthy
novelists, who have succeeded where Henry
James failed, would, I have little doubt sub-
scribe to every word. Such thorough 'prac-
titioners can have little sympathy with the
so-called “expressionist” school. “Expres-
sionism,” with its disdain of technique, offers
a potential refuge for the incompetent.

Doffing the Motley
On a previous occasion Seymour Hicks
adventured beyond the stage and assumed the
rede of mentor of youth—and a good mentor
he was too. He lias in Hullo, Australians!
(Duckworth) made a more ambitious flight
and constituted himself a critic of Australia
and Australian ways. Perhaps he could
not, if he would, be other than genial, humor-
ous and sometimes flippant, and if we may
feel at times a little irritated by hjs com-
ments—for we are “tetchy” folk—we
cannot deny that underneath the sur-
face he has a sincere regard for us and a
genuine concern about our future. His book
which takes the form of a novel, is, in fact’
a commentary by a. shrewd, widely-travelled
man who has a practical commonsense out-
look on life. To his previous work he gave
the title “Difficulties,” and the present vol-
ume might well bear the same label, for

And at Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Launceston, Hobart.
outstanding in its pages he deals with two
difficulties that go to the heart of our life.
Setting aside the minor topics touched on
by his bright pen, we come to those where
it slackens in pace. On his voyage to Aus-
tralia, Green, a typical Englishman with an
income which permitted him to do nothing
in particular,” hears about a White Aus-
tralia,” apparently a concept new to lnm, so
small a people, after all, are we in the uni-
verse. He discusses it with two native-born
Australians who view the question from dif-
ferent points. “I’d have you know, said
one, “that ours is a land of /*'9?“ om . ll ? ap '
able of supporting nearly 000 millions
with ease. There’s no other new country
to-day that could do that, is there. Y\ by,
when we have a White Australia, England
will be as safe as if she were one ot our
own villages, instead of being a speck m the
North completely surrounded by bayonets.
This Australian admits that our present
population is about six millions, but he is
rather uncertain as to the means by which
the point of safety, a reasonably full popula-
tion, is to be reached. Green’s persistency
annoys him. “I’m all for it,” remarks the
inquirer apologetically; “but like the man
who wanted to build a house, and only had a
ten-pound note and no credit, I am thinking
how it is to be done.” His _ Australian
acquaintance, Bingland, patriotic but im-
patient, replies: “Never mind how, it will
have to be done. Why, in the first place, if
our birth-rate continues as it’s going on at
present, we should double our population in
MO years, and if we can bring into the coun-
try 60,000 people a year, as I understand we
can, that would mean another 1,800,000.
“I see,” said Green: “so that in 1954 you
would have about 14 or 15 million people in
your country, which is capable of supporting,
say, 250 millions. It isn’t quite enough,_ is it,
for such a great place as 1 am learning it
is? And to get that number it would take
SO years! So many things might, happen m
30 years.” Then Bingland turned on him:
“Are you for Asiatics?” Green deprecates
the idea. It would upset a great ideal
and one with which he sympathises. He
just wanted to know how it was proposed to
lock up a hemisphere from which millions
were struggling to find an outlet. Jackson,
a second acquaintance, also wanted to know.
He pointed out that the victims ot over-popu-
lation in Asia might as well die in a war
seeking outlet as be decomposed by the inter-
nal pressure in their own country. vV hat
Jackson suggested was: “Let them all come.
Let us make them good Australians! Let
us use them as America has used her new
arrivals! Rule them, if you like, with a rod
of steel, and keep all who enter, except those
of British blood, without a vote if need
be.... Development is what we want and
must have.” .
Then Jackson becomes reflective. Our
policy to-day,” he remarks to the receptive
Green, “is one of sitting contentedly on a
comfortable present. The individual is pros-
perous and happy because the workman m
Australia is living under conditions un-
known in any other part of the world Quite
right that he should —but he should blend
patriotism with his plenty, or he will some
day wake up to find that a too-comfortable
present is often the prelude to an uncomfort-
able future —-and that’s not what the great
men who discovered our country gave tiiur
lives for.” He deprecates the idea that the
country is or may be going back:
O Lord, no! But it isn’t going forward at the
pace it ought t 0.... I’m all for the working-man
living the happy life God meant every human crea-
ture to enjoy, but there’s a vast difference in creat-
ing a working-man’s paradise for the real working
expert and the setting up of unions which block
the road at every turn so that their inefficient
members may be protected. It’s not Labor in itself
that’s going to ruin Australia, Mr. Green; it’s the
tick on Labor’s back, the wasters, not the workers ;
those who agitate continually for higher wages,
shorter hours, innumerable holidays and double
and sometimes treble rates of pay for overtime....
A Labor Premier, however honest and however
wide his vision, if he is dependent for power on
an unreasonable democracy, is a man who, if he
wishes to hold that power, must be ready to dance
to any tune played on a concertina, a mouth-organ
or a penny whistle, and must be prepared at all
times to give or take an anesthetic at his master’s
bidding.
Having let the characters in his book have
their say. the author in his own proper per-
son adds a few explanatory remarks “An
idealist is one thing,” he says; “an ostrich
is another.” The present policy of drift
won’t do. Very rightly Australia wishes her-
self white, but wishing alone will not bring
it about:
That civilisation at no distant date will have to
face the Wiping out of the Communist and the Bol-
shevist. or cease to exist., is as certain as that the
sun shines, and also that probably before this old
world has celebrated many more birthdays, the
Last will have flung a challenge to the West is no
reason that either of these dangers must be allowed
to throw into shadow the fact that an overcrowded
hemisphere in the North and Middle East, and an
unoccupied one in the South, constitutes as grave a
menace to the peace of Great Britain as anything
that can be well imagined... A Labor Government
overseas, in whose hands is the destiny of barely
6,000,000 people, may, by pursuing a policy of drift
on the subject-to-day, fling Britain’s countless mil-
lions into a struggle to-morrow which will surely
not only threaten the life of the Queen of the Pacific
but the very existence of Great Britain herself l

Lawrence’s “St. Mawr”
“St. Mawr.” by D. H. Lawrence, is pro-
hibited, I understand, in Maoriland. When
I lived in that coercive country I used to
marvel at its people’s obsolescence—for they
seemed intelligent. Really, their mid-Vic-
torian refusal to read a book is its recom-
mendation. “St. Mawr,” like those modern
examples of the banned, “The Genius” and
“Jurgen,” is no exception to the rule. One
is forced to the conclusion that not Law-
rence’s lewdness hut his intellectual insight
and his spiritual power of disrobing con-
vention and cant are the unpardonable sins
of. him. Symbolically in “St. Mawr” the
noble bay stallion is instinctively greater in
his pride, aloof independence and virile
violence than most of the superior reasoning
beings who flutter heavily about in his orbit.
At least here is polemically a thesis for
thoughtful treatment. There must be com-
plete failure to comprehend the story unless,
with Lou, the reader faces the question of
the horse’s motives —“was it the natural wild
thins in him....or was it the slave, assert-
ing himself for vengeance?” T here you hate
superb symbolism, as you have in
mastery over men of two wonderfully-draw
women —in the case of one a sex masteiy,
in the case of the other a sexless mastery.
These women as they stride the story are
colossal “studies” —the one seeking a con-
queror, the other to conquer. It is all de-
veloped with supreme artistry.
“St. Mawr” is rich in the unleashed
thought that tantalises, amazes, liornfies, and
is sped from as it is flung into the bottom-
less pit in one’s self. True to the Freudian
mission of bringing emancipation through
expressing the unexpressed, Lawrence is
thus liberator for thousands whose re-
pressions make blisters on the s; ■
blast character and conduct bytheirfonded
secretiveness. All who have thought things
and hidden them find why and liow thoughts
are things as potent as thumbscrews. It
hardly matters whether the women ot fet.
Mawr” are mystically mighty or merely mo -
bid—decadent or illuminati, in the grip ot
hysteria or of inspiration, pornographic or
puissantly pure: it does matter that, tlnoug
the Laurentian larynx, voice is to the
centuries-old forbidden, and thus a h,y P
vided for opening the doors to the unknown
1>U Mrs. al ’Witt and her daughter Lou (Lady
Henry Carrington) are rich Americans
whose rival neuricity flings them into ex-
hausting argumentation on men after Lou
has wedded amiable Rico, tired of him and
bought St. Mawr. (Of Rico and Lou: fas-
cinating each other, they reacted badly on
each other’s nerves.”) From England mother
and daughter rush to America, and on a
ranch in the Rockies (admirably is the set-
ting silhouetted) Lou, having at last to live
for something that mattered, settles down
under the influence of vast open spaces, be-
cause. as she says, “a wild spirit wants me,
a wild spirit more than men. And so
“either my taking a man shall have a mean-
ing and a mystery that penetrates my very
soul, or I will keep to myself. And what
I know is that the time has come tor me to
keep to myself. No more messing about.
“St Mawr” shows strength in three respects
—in interpreting a horse, in satirising society
and in its psyclio-analysism of types ot
femininity It shows —what must be signi-
ficantly disquieting to some who have. Law-
rence’s women-hatred compartmentalised
that mere man can also be devastatingly dis-
sected by an anatomist of the sub-conscious
and made look exceedingly little under the
lash of Realism at large in the' unconscious.
Mrs. Witt cynically holds that one s heart
has to be broken as sure as one s virginity.
This she says in the beginning, not the end.
Her successes with men had been so con-
tinuous that she had even a contempt for
God “She felt she could make Him kiss her
hand.” It is by touches such as this that
Lawrence startles.
Lou is made to reflect in the grand manner
on modern life, fallen under the spell of
evil “The whole world was enveloped in
one great flood.” Certain pages of parable
on horse and rider are literature of purpose
as much as of art: —
The evil! the mysterious potency of evil! She
could sec it all the time, in individuals, in society, in
the press. There it was in socialism and bolshevism;
the same evil But bolshevism made a mess of the
outside of life, so turn it down Try fascism.
Fascism would keep the surface of life intact, and
carry on the undermining business all the better.
Madness, surely, to cast out such a challeng-
ing work! . , . ((rn .
The second long story m the book is Ilie
Princess.” It is horribly well done m its
swift, simple, symbolic craftsmanship. A
scoffing story of hidden meanings that mean
riddles! Or seems savagely so, with its
suggestion in this Woman Who Did of an
unrepentant Faust, and another subtle sug-
gestion of the female spider that Fabre
unmasks.
R. S. ROSS.
My Three-decker
Shortly after I left .school, fired with the
desire to do something really great in the
literary world. I determined on writing a
book of what was then known as “three-
decker” dimensions. It was to be of no less
length than a hundred-thousand words. With
mighty confidence I set about my task.
Equipped with writing material m plenty,
I sailed serenely forth on my voyage into the
Unknown. Had I guessed into what dull
and tiresome realms of monotony that voy-
age was to lead me it would never have
been entered upon, and pinch good paper
would have remained unsoiled.
The scene of my story I laid in the pine-
scrub down Riverina way. I knew the
country thereabouts pretty well, and could
write of it with some degree, of accuracy
and without levying too largely on my
imagination. But with my characters it
was different. Do what I might I could not
make them seem real. My heroine was a
sentimental doll without a drop of red blood
in her veins. My hero was a negative char-
acter, who paraded as a bushman. The vil-
lain was the only figure with any vitality in
him. and he was an out-and-out ruffian, who
murdered freely and furiously wherever
occasion demanded the letting of blood. In
him I tried to picture a boy that I lived
with oh a farm in the Bathurst district. He
was subject to brain-waves —saw red. and
on two occasions did red things. What
those deeds were, since he may still be living.
1 do not care to say, and in my book I gave
him the fictitious name of Hoon. How he
shaped after I lost sight of him I do not
know, but in the course of my tale I well and
truly drowned the character drawn to his
measurement. ...
The first part of the book dealt with
drought: the secoud with flood. Before I
was half-done with the drought, no thirsty
bushman on a dry stretch ever prayed more
heartily than I that it would break. But 1
had allotted fifty thousand words to it, and,
till they were written, it had to go on killing
sheep and cattle and fiercely scorching the
scenery. Each chapter opened with long
remarks about the weather. like King
Charles’s head it intruded itself, and no page
was (Complete without abundant mention of
it. It called for the use of so many adjec-
tives that before I was half done with it
1 was bankrupt of terms with which to
describe it. Oh.' those adjectives—what
spendthrift use I made of them! I mar-
shalled them in droves and legions. I dressed
them in all colors —some in golden garb,
some in purple raiment. Each chapter would
start with a reference to pitiless skies and
sunbaked acres, or mention would be made
of a brazen dome above an arid earth. The
sun came in for a lot of vilification and
abuse, which on afterthought I do not think
it deserved.
When the drought at last broke I sighed
with relief, and started in with renewed vigor
to deal it out to the rain. Like stout Cortez
gazing down on the Pacific, I felt that a
new realm had opened up before me. Seeing
that I was shockingly short of adjectives I
contrived, through the second half of the
book, to make it rain pretty decently. I
made the creeks roar and the rivers run
bankers, and when the whole unfortunate
country was inundated I gleefully drowned
Hoon, the villain of the piece. Before the
book lay finished before me the weather,
drought and rain together, had made a piti-
able ruin of the landscape.
Though the story was written much work
still remained to do. It needed copying out,
and anyone who has taken up a pen to copy
out one hundred thousand words will shudder
at the magnitude of the task that awaited
me. But just then, at the despairful moment,
happy chance knocked at the door and stepped
over the threshold. An obliging friend, who
was learning the use of the typewriter, gal-
lantly came to my aid, and typed it out for
me. Neatly tied up in brown paper the book
went on its way to London, and I sat down
to wait patiently for the fame and fortune
which I imagined it was sure to bring me. I
felt that it was bound to be rushed by some
London publisher, and that it would be the
means of hoisting me on to a pedestal. Glow-
ing inwardly I watched for the hour of my
triumph. But when months passed without
bringing the glad tidings that I waited for,
the inward glow began slowly to pale.
Slowly, too, I began to feel that I didirt
wdnt the book published—that, after all, it
might not be quite the literary masterpiece
that, in the first flush of authorship. I had
thought it to be. From hoping that it would
be accepted, 1 fell to dreading that it might
be, and when a full year had passed I sent
off to England recalling it. The event proved
that I need not have perturbed myself about
it seeing printed form. In due time the
neatly-tied parcel came back to me, and from
the appearance of it I don’t think it had been
even opened, much less read.
One winter night, shortly after its arrival,
I sat by a red coal fire, and joyfully con-
signed it to the flames. Sheet after sheet I
watched go up in smoke —purple adjectives
and golden adjectives, multitudinous in their
array.
RODERIC QUINN.
Meldrum’s Art
In “Art and Art Criticism” (R.P.
94/Q/'9N j “W M W ” asserts that Mel-
T* 7 , J ’ l ’ i,,1i.,, “irlMiism”
drums landscape lacks lea y, 1 \ ’
“poetry” and romance. Now Meldrum strives
to depict Nature as she really is, and re-
all attempts to imbue a scene with the
three last-named “qualities” as being opposed
to (ho artist’s job. As a result he purposely
refrains from embodying these alleged quali-
ties —this sentimental tripe—in his canvases.
With this in mind one reads with amuse-
ment “W.M.W.’s” unconscious self-portrait:
‘•Critics frequently slate an artist for not
doing something or other which he deliber-
ately refrains from doing.”
A little later we find the critic stumbling
badly again. He says: “So we find that art
is emotion plus beauty; that is. to say, the
creative vision of the artist idealises the
crude realisms of life.” This is m conflict
with the aims of nearly all the Old Masters,
especially Velasquez and Millet. In,his por-
traits and genre paintings the great Spani-
ard depicts 'the hideously-deformed dwarfs
and idiots of the Spanish Court in a most
realistic manner. There has been no attempt
to idealise these “crude realisms of life,
yet no one except flic cubists, etc., dares to
denounce these works, much and all as they
would really like to. Millet, the great
Frenchman, also failed to idealise. His por-
traits of peasants worn out with the relent-
less drudgery of tlieir work were so terribly
realistic that he was branded as a Socialist
when lie exhibited them.
Tn short, “W.M.W.’s” article is full of
high-sounding words and phrases that have
nothing to do with the painter’s work. These
sentimental outbursts of the tender aesthetic
are quite foreign to real art. The bleat for
sugar all the time limits the field of art and
would eventually kill all art with monotony.
Incidentally, the reference to Meldrum s
students spreading “their palette with Mel-
drum mud” is very vicious and quite un-
couth. At the same time one feels that, as
so much mud has been flung at Meldrum, it
would be no wonder if some had stuck.
JIM MINOGUE.
“Privateer”: The dust was blown off a rare eariy-
Tasmanian publication at the Hobart Public Library
the other day. It is a copy of a pirated edition of
the “Pickwick Papers,” published by Henry Dowling,
Launceston, in 1839. Dowling was owner of the
Launceston Examiner and hit on the idea of pub-
lishing Dickens’s work without asking anybody’s
permission. The preface states that the book is
confidently believed to be the largest publication
which has issued from either the New South Wales
or the Tasmanian press.” It is well printed, and
seems to have been issued in 24-page instalments.
There are about 30 illustrations after the originals
by “Phiz.” They are all marked “Phiz” in one
corner and “Tiz, V.D.L.” in the other, and the only
clue to the identity of the latter is that some of
them are in addition marked “Seymore.” The
Hobart copy is marked 635., but this is a later
price put on by one of its many owners. Anyhow,
the cost drew a deep sigh from the publisher; “The
trouble and expense have indeed been considerable-
much greater than contemplated.” There are not
many copies about, but one is known to have changed
hands a few years ago at £2O.
“Xuaved”: “Arundel Dene” in his article on
John Lane (B. l/10/’25) does not mention that the
origin of the title Bodley Head came from the fact
that over the bookshop started by Lane and Elkin
Mathews hung a sign, like that of a tavern, with
a painting of Sir Thomas Bodley on a panel)—the
learned man, of course, whom King James knighted,
and after whom Oxford’s Bodleian library is called.

10* Stamina
It used to take 30 days to travel from
London to Bagdad. Today, through the
service of General Motors automobiles,
one may make the trip in 10 days.
Across the Syrian desert —between
Beirut on the Mediterranean and Bag-
dad in Iraa —convoys of Buicks and
Cadillacs are carrying passengers and
mail on regular schedule.
Though heavily laden and carrying
supplies of water, fuel and oil, they
cover 600 miles of sandy waste
in 30 hours most of the trip at
racing speed. The tested stamina of
General Motors cars and trucks has
led to their selection wherever the
going is hardest. They have become
the standard of motor car perform-
ance and value in every country
of the world.

HERE is no more noticeable feature of a man’s attire
than his Half-Hose. The growing preference for shoes
—in itself a step in the right direction—makes still more
necessary the most careful discrimination in the choice of
Half Hosiery. That this fact is now widely recognised is
reflected in the instant popularity achieved amongst well
dressed men, by Bond’s latest production—
Bond’s R.K. 54 Half* Hose
R.K.. 54 is a Pure-Silk-Plated Sock that combines particularly
fine appearance with an abnormal capacity to stand up against
wear. A wide range of check patterns, as distinctive as they
are tasteful, rounds off the list of practical
attractions that put R.K. 54 in a class by itself,
at the price at which it sells everywhere. Per pair
4/11
You should certainly give consideration to Bond’s R.K.54 when next
you purchase Half-Hose, for apart from the important considerations
of securing the most in service and value, you are taking a further
step in the right direction by purchasing a Made-in-Australia article.
You are helping your country to become more self-supporting, more self-
re iant, more self-respecting. You are rendering a community service
that will ultimately yield you, as an Australian, rich returns in
national wealth and security.

The Garnering.
Although I may not walk with you again
For many a day
Across the hills to where the green slopes
meet
The old seaway,
I shall not grieve, however long the years
We dwell apart,
Because of garnered sheaves of memories
Hid in my heart.
The tremblim' gold of poplars tall and slim
Against the blue
Of a wide sky that dipped to purple hills,
The changing hue .
Of dewy uplands and the white mists low
On silver seas —
1 shall be glad through all the years to coma
Because of these.
The fragrance of the gorse in the hot sun,
The tawny bees
Droning across the fields of scented mint
And on the breeze
The faint, salt tang of sea-washed sands
where tides
Crept slow to meet
The flocks of eager, grey-winged gulls and
lave
Their scarlet feet!
I wonder if you turn, as oft I do,
A cherished store,
Wrought all of sun and wind and meadow
grass
And the wild shore,
Of rain upon the young oaks in the spring,
Of mist and dew,
And all the joys of hill and sea that we
Together knew.
Now you will walk alone across the fields
In the still morn
And watch the sunshine and the shadow play
On the bent corn;
But I of hill and moor and piny grove
Have taken toll
And all the largesse gleaned is locked away
Deep in my soul.

Who has not spring within, spring knows

Who will not sing, for him no echoes

Whose heart is still in no sweet-mem’ried

Shall he be Sifted up by love or song.
What bosom lives that leans on no kind
breast,
That blooms in fat complacency, a weed i
What mind is that which has no friend con-
fessed?
What book is that which has no line to
read ?
Each soul that lives needs kindred soul to
cling to;
A loveless heart is lone in every spot.

Haunted Sleep.
While down the cliffs long shadows creep,
The great sea . heaves in uneasy sleep.
Like a Titan tired with weary breast,
In its hollow bed it lies at rest.
As it sways and swoons so vast, so blue,
I dream, as I gaze, that it dreams too.
While under the cliffs the shadows creep,
It heaves through the hours in haunted sleep.
As I stand and muse in loneliness,
What its dreams may be I fear to guess.

Reciprocation.
I love the earth.
I love her curving shoulders;
Her breasts that rise and swell,
Her long-armed valleys lying
Among her streaming hair.
I love her voice replying
In echo to my own,
The saga of her boulders.
And this I hope of her:
That maybe when I’m dying
She’ll fold me close;
And after....
That she’ll love the thing that moulders.

And, like a dream by fading love-thoughts
kissed,
Its vaporous folds exhale the lingering
beam.
The breeze is falling, and the birds delay.
With drowsy twitter, loath to lose the
light;
The rosy peak pales to a ghostly grey,
The forest listens for the coming night.
Over the cornfield stealing, silent shades —•
The watcher zephyrs—pass as day expires;
Then, as the scene in shrouding shadow
fades,
High on the mountain gleam the wood-
men’s fires.

AUSTRALIA—WHERE NATIONALISA-
TION HAS ALMOST ARRIVED.
The Communist-Labor programme devotes a
certain amount of space to pious (and other)
generalities, and the balance to schemes for
the “nationalisation” of things generally,
some of them several times over. The mean-
ing of this particular brand of nationalisa-
tion is that all properties and industries are
to pass, forcibly and without compensation
for previous owners, to the community, and
be held and administered and managed by
trustees on behalf of the community. These
trustee people will be accountable to the com-
munity if the community can find means of
calling them to account. So much froth and
fuss are expended on this topic that it is
worth while to remember that, instead of
nationalisation being a new and brilliant
diseovery, a good deal of it exists already,
and that the rowdy mob of Gardens and
Walshes have accomplished none of it.
The Commonwealth consists of 1,903,731.840
acres. Of this area 1,734,615,006 acres, or
over 91 per cent., are the property of the
people. Measured by space, private
ownership hardly exists. If the nation-
alised regions are poorly developed and yield
little, that isn't wholly the fault of the soil.
Much of it is good enough, and some is of
the best. The community owned 24,199 miles
of nationalised railway last year, and owns
more now. It pays no taxes to the
Treasury, as the lines would have to do if
privately owned. In fact, during the
last year for which complete figures are
available, the various Treasuries paid
£1,560,300 to the railways. This was made
up by taxes on private property and private
industry, but if these are nationalised and
made tax-free the subsidy will have to be
found elsewhere or done without, and wages
must suffer. About seven-eighths of the sub-
sidy was swallowed up by the Queensland
lines, and despite all this eleemosynary aid
the Queensland railroaders have lately made
the father of a row on the plea that, com-
pared with others, they were underpaid. Aus-
tralia possesses also a nationalised shipping
line, which once mustered 54 vessels but is
now much smaller. It has lost about £8,000,000
and is still losing. But for help out of the
taxes contributed by private industry the
line would probably have perished altogether.
Likewise the note issue is entirely nation-
alised, which is something approaching a
world record. The Federal capital is national
property, and 814 per cent, of the Federal
capital territory. There is a very large
nationalised trading bank and various com-
munity-owned savings banks and rural banks.
The Post Office is public property, which is
the usual thing. So are the telegraphs and
telephones, which is not so usual. Queens-
land runs a big nationalised gamble, and
another is reported as impending in N. S.
Wales. Other national ventures include coal-
mines, smelters, ownership of house property,
tramways, irrigation settlements, water con-
servation works, electricity supply, abattoirs,
pubs, cattle stations, sawmills, docks, fish-
shops. meatshops, meatworks and sundries.
Something is doing in the way of nationalised
insurance. And the great bulk of insurance
is done on cheap and efficient socialistic
principles by co-operative concerns from
which the capitalist is eliminated.
* * * *
Public landholding, which came by inheri-
tance and before modern Communism was
dreamt of, and the note issue, which is
the simple matter of taking a loan from
the public without interest, pay fairly
well, barring the fact that land revenue
in the Northern Territory, where the
nationalisation policy is most complete,
hardly covers the cost of collection.
But the herd of small and medium enter-
prises are a most unprofitable lot. The ques-
tions at issue now are (1) whether Aus-
tralia, with all its wide experience of nation-
alised enterprise, reauires to take lessons in
the art from ignorant imported seamen of
the insurrectionary and strike-making vari-
ety, and an imported ex-parson, and others
of the sort; (2) whether, if more nationali-
sation is wanted, it is advisable to wade in
blood in order to get it their way, when it
seems to be quite obtainable without their
officious interference; and (3) whether it
will pay to make a revolutionary wreck of
things in order that this roaring crowd of
importations may become trustees and man-
agers of property and industry in general,
that being the part which they have plainly
marked out for themselves, though their
business capacity may be only that of the
aboriginal. For the masses there are always
these aspects to be considered :
The individual worker may be part-owner of
assets and enterprises galore, yet he can’t sell his
share for a penny or borrow a penny on his share.
That is how things are now, and if everything was
nationalised the position would be exactly the same.
Things are so bad that the individual can’t even
get a free ride in his own tram-car.
If the individual worker leaves the nationalised
country he must leave his share of everything, how-
ever large that share may be, behind him. The
lot isn’t divisible or realisable. No man can sell
his bi[ of the railways or the Commonwealth Bank
if he wants to go away now, and if everything is
nationalised he won’t be able to sell or remove
his share of anything.
And though a nationalised State would require a
certain number of foremen and overseers, the pros-
pect for the great bulk of the rank and file would
be a dead level of wage earning or wage slavery all
their days. No one could set up a business for
himself, if all was nationalised business and every-
body served one master, except by going into politics.
And even then he wouldn’t be in business for him-
self, but for the political machine.
Viewed as an investment for the rank and
file the Communist revolution looks doubtful.

THE ELECTION IN SOUTH AUS.
Three years ago, when only 147,911 of the
277,916 enrolled South Aus. electors marked
ballot-papers and 9911 invalidated them, Labor
won four of the Central State’s seven seats in
the House of Reps. It has never done
better, and it is unlikely to do better next
month. Its opponents are confident that it
won’t do as well. Their idea is that the
compulsory-voting law and the feeling
aroused among the farmers by the incessant
Labor-supported shipping strikes have made
the election a gift for them, especially as the
Nationalists and the Cockies are now allied,
whereas they fought each other briskly in
1922. State Labor-Premier Gunn ad-
mitted in his Budget speech that, since the
British seamen came out, the Harbor Board
alone had lost £20,000 or £25,000 of revenue.
What South Aus. industry lias lost during
12 months of Walshevik strikes, and what
it stands to lose if they go on for another
12 months, can only be guessed at. Labor
complicity in these insane strikes has obvi-
ously done the Charlton crowd harm; and
the longer the present situation lasts, and
the more the impression grows that a man
who produces stuff for the British market
would have no guarantee under a Labor Gov-
ernment that it would be shipped at the
right time, if at all, the greater the harm
will be.
Laborites admit that Malcolm Cameron
is safe in Barker and Foster in Wakefield.
Neither of these electorates has ever had a
Labor member, and the Nationalist majori-
ties are pretty certain to be increased, in
Wakefield especially. Since 1922 there has
been a drift of industrial population from
the Labor stronghold of Wallaroo, which gave
Stokes, the Labor candidate, 2481 first pre-
ferences (out of 7076) and Foster only
1063. On the other hand, Makin (Labor)
is secure in Hindmarsh, where he polled
15,111 to 6925 three years ago. The mercurial
Yates also expects to hold Adelaide for
his party, but he is by no means so strongly
entrenched as Makin. He lost the seat by
339 votes in 1919, and won it back by 719
votes in 1922. On the latter occasion he
polled nearly 2 to 1 in East Adelaide and
over 4 to 1 in West Adelaide, but was behind
in the other four subdivisions —St. Peters,
Prospect, North Adelaide and Walkerville.
So McLeay, who is opposing Yates again,
has a fighting chance. In the neighboring
electorate of Boothby Laborite Harry Knee-
rone is having another shot at ,T. G. Duncan-
Hughes, who, when a comparative stranger,
beat him by 10,804 to 8943. Ivneebone is
the enthusiast who said at the last Federal
Labor Conference that he would “scrap all
munitions of war” and (after a pause for
deep thought) “defend the White Australia
policy in Australia.” He is not a strong
candidate, nor is there any indication that
Unley, Burnside and Goodwood have re-
pented of the massive anti-IvNEEBONE vote
they cast in 1922. Labor's prospects are
better in Grey, where Andrew Lacey de-
feated the veteran Poynton by 9778 to 8425
and the Labor three for the Senate
also had a substantial majority. J. A.
Lyons, a farmer, is the Ministerial
candidate this time. The compulsory-
voting provision should help him, for
on the last occasion the proportion of
voters to electors was very mucli lower in
non-Labor subdivisions than in Labor centres
like Port Pirie and Peterborough. In these
two places 5957 electors out of 9069 re-
ceived ballot-papers; the Labor man got
3961 effective votes, and his opponent 1655.
In six non-Labor districts there were 9739
electors, and only 4661 voters; Poynton’s
share of the valid papers was 2723 and
Lacey’s 1516. Lacey has been an indus-
trious member, and Port Pirie and Peter-
borough will give him another good start, but
an 80 or 90 p.c. vote in the agricultural
parts would make things very sultry for
him. Angas, the remaining electorate, is
a puzzle. It used to be represented by P. M.
Glynn, and Labor reckoned it so hopeless a
proposition that it did not run a candidate
in 1903, 1910, 1913 or 1914. But many of
the inhabitants are of German descent, and
after the conscription business they turned
against Glynn, who would have gone down
in 1917 but for the votes of soldiers in the
trenches. In 1919 Joel Moses Garb de-
feated him by 9468 to 9217, and in 1922 Garb
retained the seat by 31,192 to SO9O, his oppo-
nent being George Ritchie, previously one
of Barwell’s Ministers. Simultaneously the
Labor candidates for the Senate received
8310 votes in Angas and the non-Labor can-
didates 10,075, which suggests that Garb’s
majority was largely due to liis impassioned
championship of the German settlers when
they had few friends. These German settlers
are not really Laborites, and their return to
their old way of voting is only a question
of time. The shipping strikes and the
Locarno security pact will accelerate the
process. In any case, Gabb will find W. L.
Parsons, an able! member of a distinguished
S. Aus. family, tougher to overcome than
Ritchie, who shared in the unpopularity
that was to engulf the Barwell Government.
* * * *
For the Senate in 1922 the Labor trio
polled 65,095 first preferences against
69,117 recorded for their seven opponents,
but the splitting and exhaustion of anti-
Labor votes enabled them to gain the three
seats. It is improbable that I)ai.y, Lundie
and George will be as fortunate this time,
even though there are four Ministerialists in
the field. As to that, the N. S. Wales
A.L.P. executive did not think it a handicap
to run six Labor candidates for five vacan-
cies, and would have nominated the six if
Premier Lang had not been reminded of his
promise to Parliament that stopgap Senator
Gibbs would not be a starter. Nor is Wil-
son, the Minister of Markets and Migration,
likely to be disadvantaged much by being
fourth on the list. The S.A. Cocky group
is not nearly as strong, relatively to the
Nationalists, as the Country parties in N. S.
Wales, Vic. and Westralia, nor will the rank
and file be as narrow-minded as the party
bosses, who insisted on their technical right
to pre-select another man. As a matter of
fact. Wilson has troops of friends ; and the
British tariff concessions which he helped
to negotiate with the Baldwin Government,
and which were refused by the preceding
Ramsay Macdonald Government when a
word from the churlish Charlton crowd
might have made a difference, have brightened
the outlook for thousands of S.A. orchardists
and irrigation-settlers. Certainly all the in-
dications are that the Ministerialists will
capture the three seats in the Senate.

THE LAW’S DAY OFF.
On Sunday the Law takes its day off. It
is dies non, and the debt which happens to
fall due that day need not disturb the calm
of your Sabbatical thoughts. You may pay
it to-morrow if you are then in the happy
position of being able to do so.
The observance of dies non may be traced
to classical times. Under the Civil law days
Avere for judicial purposes, as well as for
other reasons, divided into two kinds. There
were dies fasti and dies nefasti, though some
portion of a day might be fastus and the
other ncfastus. On dies nefasti no courts
of justice were held; they were either days
sacred to the gods or days of festival devoted
to the enjoyment of good living and the rap-
tures of the amphitheatre, where perchance
a few Christians might have a round or two
with the lions.
With the conquest of England William
brought across the Channel a body of Nor-
man-French law saturated with the spirit of
ancient Rome. But even prior to that, in
Anglo-Saxon days, when England had been
linked to the great Papal centre at the Synod
of Whitby, Sunday had been held too sacred
to admit the secular affairs of the law. Even
a criminal could not be executed on that day.
He had dies non in which to prepare for the
morrow. “ Dies dominions non est juridicus”
runs the old maxim, and to the Lord’s Day
have been added those of His birth and death,
Christmas and Good Friday. The Houses of
Parliament may, in case of necessity, sit
on such days, but no Judge may take his seat
on the Bench. The Inns of Court in the
Middle Ages rigidly enforced attendance at
chapel on Sundays and holy days. They saw
to it that no illicit legal work ivas done on
dies non. Surveyors were appointed to
search all the chambers of the houses
attached to the Inns, “and to take the names
of all suche as do lye in anye of the chambers
aforesaid, and to present the same to the
Readers every terme.” Also, they saw to
it that no worldly distractions took the
thoughts of young limbs of the law from the
serious business of “chappel.” It was pro-
vided that “no women or boyes be suffered
to come within the chappel.” Every term
the members of the Bar were called upon to
pay eightpence per head for the maintenance
of the chaplain.
But because Sunday is a dies non on which
legal business cannot, as a general rule, be
transacted, it does not follow that the penal
side is held up. You may be arrested on a
Sunday just as you might be on any other
day. If, for example, your milkman, find-
ing you at home on dies non, seized the oppor-
tunity to violently demand payment of the
long-overdue account, and if you pointed
out to him that the day was not running for
such a purpose, and if he, disregarding the
point, proceeded to beat you with his fists,
then you would be excused from payment,
and he could be handed over to the police.
On that sacred day you are relieved from
doing your duty to your creditor, and he
must not resent it by force and arms. With
the first stroke of midnight it will be to-
morrow, and that is his day.
There is an ancient piece of legislation,
the Sunday Observance Act of 1677, by
which the second Charles compounded for
his sins by inflicting on his subjects a
schedule of Sunday prohibitions that almost
equalled the restrictions of the Puritan days.
This Act had nothing to do, of course, with
the more aristocratic offspring of the Com-
mon law dies non, but just added a few more
inconveniences. Under it the service or
execution of any writ, process, judgment, etc.,
except for treason, felony or breach of the
peace, was made absolutely void. This
enabled all sorts of gentry, hiding in obscure
corners and attics, and thus seeking to avoid
the Fleet or Marshalsea of the day, to come
out for an airing in the face of bailiffs and
duns and smile at them or even proffer the
courtesy of a pinch of snuff. They only had
to watch the clock. The Act, in effect, also
rendered all contracts entered into on Sun-
day null and void, provided that any party
to the business undertaking was one of the
class affected by the statute and acted in
his ordinary calling.
This antique law, now more honored in
the breach than the observance, is still on
the statute book. We took it over with other
lumber. “Any person,” says this enactment,
“being of the age of 14 years or upwards,
tradesman, artificer or workman, laborer or
other person whatsoever doing or exercising
any worldly labor, business or work of his
ordinary calling upon the Lord’s Day or any
part thereof,” works of necessity or charity
only excepted, may be fined five shillings
and in default of payment may “be publicly
set in the stocks for two hours.” There
used to be stocks in Sydney, somewhere near
Druitt-street; and in old Windsor (N.S.W.)
they had them, too, and in its market-place
once stood a pillory. It was under this sere
and yellow 7 piece of law that not so long ago
young policemen used to summons the dis-
ciples of Confucius for cultivating their
cabbages on Sunday. For some odd reason
barbers were early held to be exempt from
the law, and since that day it has been suc-
cessfully dodged and evaded in multiple ways
till now it is practically dead.
But dies non still flourishes, a healthy
shoot of the law. It is a little obscure and
uncertain, due probably to its Common-law 7
birth. No man is quite sure of its limita-
tions. An English law journal recently
quoted the obiter dicta of a Judge that if
you buy your dinner at a restaurant on
Sunday you need not pay for it till Monday;
that is, if the vendor delivers the dinner be-
fore demanding the payment. He also re-
marked that a man was in peril—or, rather,
the other man was—if you gave him a
receipt on Sunday, for you could repudiate
the act on Monday. But this appears to be
bad law, even for a Judge. The conclusion
arrived at by a learned commentator is pro-
bably the correct one. It is that if you choose
to do a lawfful act on Sunday such as pay-
ing for your pew-rent, settling your w 7 ine-bilt
or giving a receipt for some value received,
you may do so. The payment you make or
the receipt you give will be quite good. You
are not required to do these things on Sun-
day, you may tell your creditors to wait
till Monday, but if you choose to perform
acts quite lawful in themselves on dies non
they are excusable and not invalid. But
most men w 7 ait till Monday—or later.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
lii the Matter of £IOO.
Australia’s polite but gradual Prime Min-
ister Bruce lately explained wliy liis Gov-
ernment had made no effort to collect the
£IOO fine imposed long ago on Thomas
Walsh for wantonly bringing about dam-
age to the extent of a million or two in
Australia, and attempting more. His sen-
sitive mind wouldn’t allow him to worry
Walsh’s sensitive mind over that small
debt while the latter had the deportation
proceedings to trouble him. Yet Walsh
shows no outward signs of worry and seems
to be enjoying life. Possibly his sparkle
is due in part to a conviction that the Prime


Minister dare not collect the fine. Possibly
the other part is due to a firm belie that the
same gentleman will never deport him how-
ever much his Board may recommend that
course. It isn’t a Deportation Court, pei-
manent and available whenever requir ,
with real Judges on the bench and power to
hand down judgments. At its best it can
only advise the Ministry to do
and thus leave it with a responsibility which
it may be too tender-hearted to carry,
that body had more pangs about the laigt
and certain worries of the Australian
people, who pay it to protect them an ge
mighty little protection, and fewer about
the possible worries of the people s most
conspicuous enemy, it might be a more
esteemed institution than it is. Maybe it.
suffers from an unfortunate inability to put
itself in the other fellow’s place. Through
the hold-up of exports gigantic ruin is loom-
ing before primary producers of many sorts ,
and the artificial unrest, fomented almost
wholly by imported persons, does steadily-
increasing damage to manufacturing indus-
try. If there were one or two members in
the Cabinet who grew wheat and eggs tor
tlie foreign market, it might have a bettei
idea of the need for prompt action, ifiey
would supply inside knowledge. It is a
really serious question how far the I rime
Minister is justified in lending the people s
money (for that £IOO belongs to the peoples
Treasury) to a bitter revolutionary foe,
with every possibility that the amount will
be used, so far as it will go, in doing lnjuiy
to the people. Even if a general s conscience
is so tender as to be almost morbid lie
shouldn’t lend the enemy a rifle, or leave
iiim a gun which it is possible to take away
from him. Had Bruce lent Walsii £IOO
of liis own money to pay the fiue with it
might have been more grotesque, but tlie
principle wouldn’t have been altered.

The Bill of Attainder is, or was, a rude de-
vice by which Parliament could convict a
person who hadn’t done anything unlawful,
or hadn’t done anything which could be
proved. It could be applied equally to a
group of persons. The difference between it
and an ordinary criminal law was simple.
The ordinary law says that if people, neces-
sarily including SMITH, do a certain thing,
death or something else will be served out
by Judge and jury, or Judge without jury.
The Attainder process serves out. death or
something else to Smith, and gets rid ot
him. It was a handy process in its day,
much used by ruffianly monarclis who had
gone Off tiieir heads with drink, rage, terror,
sibw hatted, the desire to marry another
woman, or any wild emotion. Senator
“Jupp” Gardiner was in a regal and attaint-
ing frame of mind when he declared that, it
he returned to the Upper House at the head
of an obedient majority, the whole Bruce
Ministry would be deported from its mostly-
native land, according to no law, but by
the mere fury of misdirected persons. Henry
VIII. couldn’t have struck the attitude better.
A fine specimen of the Attainder process is
actually embodied in the Arbitration Amend-
ment Bill which the Lang Ministry lately
presented to the N. S. M ales Assembly.
There are five unions for which the Com-
munist element and its imported leaders ha\e
on implacable hatred because they are com-
posed of mostly-Australians who didn t join
tlie pro-Hunnish strike movement of eight
years ago, and who thus prevented the rum
of the country by an all-round stoppage. Ine
passage of time has done nothing to diminish
the bitterness of these long-distance haters.
It was impossible to get the unions de-
registered under the existing law', and practi-
cally impossible to frame a law which would
suppress patriotic combinations and leave
others intact. So it was decided to arrive
at the desired end by a variation of the
Attainder. It was the simple process ot
specifying the unions that should be. genuine,
and making the five bogus by leaving them
out. There is an ingenious malignity about
the idea which has a certain fascination. lo
he out of a union is to be an industrial leper,
and it is proposed to compulsorily inoculate
certain citizens with the leprosy. To be in
a union is to practically all bread-winners
a necessity, but. though they must be in, no
provision is made by w’hich unions must
let them in. Considering the attitude and
the records of union bossdom the chance ot
admission, provided the scheme goes through,
looks small and remote, for it would be a
practical lifting of the ban which it has cost
so much time and trouble to lay down. The
way in. if there is a way. is likely to be long
and paved with humiliation, and life inside,
if the inside is ever reached, will probably
be as. hard as long-distance malice can make
it. In common decency a clause should be
added providing that compulsory non-
unionism. if it lasts over a certain limited
period, should he equivalent to divorce. Then
the wife, after making a simple declaration,
might find a new husband who was not dis-
qualified for earning a livelihood at his trade,
and at tlie same time she would get away from
the stigma of being married to one who is
an outcast from his species. Such a proviso
would make the whole business appear less
like a device for baby-starving and the tor-
ture of thin, ill-clad women than it is with-
out the divorce clause.

A Lesson in Book-keeping.
The book-keeping methods which enable the
Queensland State enterprises to show a sur-
plus—on paper—would excite derision in a
lunatic asylum. The Minister in charge
proudly claims a net profit of £33,354 on last
year’s transactions. The return is very im-
pressive :
State Enterprises 1924-25.
Loss. Profit.
State butchery .. .. £14,627
Railway refreshment rooms —• 18,548
State hotel . . . . - 5,107
State produce agency . . 2,041
State fishery .. • • l,llB
State cannery .. .. £4428
Cattle stations .. .. 3659
£BOB7 £41,441
It is a very simple matter to have a credit
by State-enterprise methods: all that has
to be done is to write down capital. The
balance-sheet of the State enterprises as at
June 30, 1924, showed them to be in a bad
way:—
Assets .. •• •• £1,650,638
Liabilities .. •• 2,344,434
Surplus of liabilities .. £693,796
That would never do. So a committee was
called in. It reported that the accumulated
losses on State stations (£674,789), State
cannery (£63,477) and State fish supply
(£39,718) were irrecoverable; also that the
cannery and fish supply had been largely
over-capitalised. The Cabinet thereupon
wrote off the following amounts as extra-
ordinary losses” :
State stations .. .. ..£074,789
State cannery . . . • • • 89,959
State fish supply . . • • 44,080
Total .. . • • • £808,828
As a result of this juggling with figures,
the surplus of liabilities (£693,796) iu 1924
was turned into a surplus' of assets
(£107,542) in 1925. The writing-down of
capital reduced the interest bill by £44,963
for the year, and so turned the actual losses
into apparent profits. The total indebtedness
of the State enterprises to the Treasury at
June 30, 1925, was £1,512,547. If necessary,
the whole amount can be written off as “irre-
coverable,” and then the net receipts from
the Socialistic enterprises will be “clear pro-
fit.” It is all so simple.

Capital Punishment.
Dear Bulletin,— A vast mass of literature
lias accumulated around the subject of capi-
tal punishment, and a recent contribution is
that of the N. S. Wales Premier, who be-
came heated (though he is always heated
now) because the Upper House consented
only to the partial extinction of the old
institution. He said :—-
Every well-informed person knows that it lias been
abolished in many European countries, . in many
American States, and in Queensland. The whole
weight of relevant evidence goes to prove that the
abolition of the death penalty has in no way con-
tributed to the commission of serious crime. As an
effective deterrent to murder, treason and other grave
crimes, it has not been efficient. Moreover, the death
penalty has been opposed on high moral and reli-
gious grounds by some of the greatest leaders of
English thought.
It is a subject on which a good deal might
be said in a dispassionate way. For in-
stance :
It is reckless to assert that "the whole weight
of relevant evidence” proves that serious crime doesn t
increase with the abolition of the death penalty.
No person, and certainly no suburban estate-agent,
carries the whole weight of relevant evidence around
in his head.
It is on record that among European States
Holland, Portugal, Roumania and Switzerland abol-
ished execution, and that Switzerland legalised it
again because the pace was growing too hot. In
the United States, Michigan, Rhode Island (1067
square miles), Maine, Wisconsin, Ohio and New
York wiped out the final penalty, afid there may
have been others. The two principal of these, Ohio
and New York, have restored it for the same reason
as Switzerland. Russia is lavish with the death
penalty, and Mr. Lanci's friends often hold it up as a
model.
If I saw a man hanged even when he deserved
it, I might possibly dislike the death penalty more
than I do. If I saw a woman murdered when she
didn’t deserve it, I might like the death penalty
much more than I do. The average murderer isn't
one-tenth so careful to avoid giving pain or to select
his subject properly as the executioner is. If I
watched a reprieved homicide right through his life-
sentence, which I haven’t time to do, and noted
how demoralising the existence is for both the confmees
and the gaolers, I might decide that there
were worse things than painless extinction.
And if I saw the whole prison gang released,
as many of the most maudlin leaders of
thought would have it, on high moral and religious
grounds, because confinement is a soul-destioying
thing, I suppose it would be necessary to found a
private-murder society in public defence. When
Henry Lawson wrote the ballad of No. 103, who was
in for a long term, he left a tearful impression that
nobody should be shut up for anything or have
anything done to him at all.
Capital punishment is a deterrent. It deters the
same person from doing it again after his release,
which often comes very early, even though the sen-
tence says that the confinee shall stay in late.
Judging from the amount of violent crime that is
perpetrated, and which the scanty police are quite
insufficient to cope with, it is surmised that many
experienced criminals are doing it again.
in the five years 1918-22 (I have no later de-
tails) there were 32 death-sentences passed in N. S.
Wales, but no one was executed. That wasn’t
enough death-penalty to justify much fuss.
If anyone proposes to deal with the question on
"high moral and religious grounds” it is best to
have a preliminary look at the old authentic code,
which was handed down direct from Heaven. The
command "Thou shalt not ivill” was directed at
the pushite to prevent him qualifying for the gal-
lows, and not at any maudlin Judge or law-maker to
prevent him sending the pushite there after he had
qualified. The divine law, so far as I can find
after a good deal of investigation, recognised only
two punishments, death and flogging, 40 lashes
being the limit, as set down in Deuteronomy 25,
verse 3. The occasional statement that a certain
class of offender should be “cut off from among the
people” has been taken to mean deportation, but it
probably signifies execution. The habit of shutting
offenders up in stone contraptions for long periods of
dry rot, with officials to watch them and dry rot
also, was not early-Israelitish. The heathen Egyp-
tian's, Assyrians, Babylonians and Romans certainly
had prisons, and the last Hebrew king, in the final
degradation of the State, had a dungeon of sorts—
possibly the coal-cellar attached to the palace—to put
prophets in; but that lone exception rather proves
the rule than otherwise. While the Government was
strong enough to enforce the law Judah seems to
have been singularly free from crime, or, at least,
there is lack of evidence to the contrary.
I would suggest that those who drag in
Scripture in support of the abolition of capi-
tal punishment should say openly that they
know more than Jehovah, and thus start
fair There is particular objection to persons
like’ Willis, M.L.C., quoting the words of
the Man on the Cross as evidence not only
against capital punishment but against any
punishment at all, for the words, as applied
by Willis, extend that far. The Man on
the Cross was profoundly generous to His
own enemies on the plea that they didn’t
know they were doing wrong. The Labor
Government aims at being generous to other
people’s enemies. To its own enemies, and
even to its mildest political opponents, it is
ferocious and not even civil. A great deal
of the anti-capital punishment agitation
arises, . in all probability, out of a morbid
and unconscious liking for crime, lours,
etc., Clifford Snook.
Liberty and Noise.
The political art of preventing public
hysteria must rank among the highest to
which a democratic leader can give his atten-
tion. The continuance of democracy depends
upon the calm with which it meets each
successive crisis; for the moment the crowd
entirely lets itself go almost anything may
happen. The most usual thing to happen is
the rise of a despot, who, whatever his other
faults may be, is able to. calm the public
mind and enable the ordinary business of
life to proceed. Augustus in Rome, Napo-
leon in France and Lenin in Russia are
all cases in point. The three men in no
way resembled one another in either origin
or outlook; yet all grasped despotic power
and held it by consent of people willing to
suffer anything rather than return to the
screaming hour of national insanity wlncn
preceded their rule. To imagine that
hysteria of the sort is purely racial, and that
British communities are not subject to it, is
to nurse a dangerous delusion. We have had
long immunity from riot on a large scale in
most British lands, but minor samples of
crowd hysteria—even if only at a football
match or in a waterside strike —prove beyond
doubt that the germ is always with us. In
older days statesmen fully recognised it.
When Mary Queen of Scots was executed
the elaborate pageant of the funeral of Sir
Philip Sidney, which cost Walsingham
£25,000 —an enormous sum in those days -
was specially arranged to hold the attention
of London. So great was the dread ot a
sudden outburst of public feeling that the
body of Sidney had been kept a full year
waiting for the show that had so much
political importance. Again, in the case ot
the beheading of Charles I. the programme
was arranged with elaborate care, h rom the
moment Charles began his walk across the
park every drum in London kept up such an
incessant thumping that nobody in all the
crowd gathered for the execution could hear
another speak; and when the axe fell two
regiments in dense formation instantly began
their march, one pushing the crowd east and
the other west, to prevent the possibility
of any demonstration. Present political
issues ’ in Australia have none ot the
tremendous sentimental appeal which marked
these crises in an older and grimmer
world, but the psychology of the crowd
is very much the same _ in all ages, and
some of the dangers remain. What is to be
deplored is that the issues of the hour are
fought out in such extravagant terms, btate-
ments of the most inflammatory kind are
made to crowds which are likely on occasion
to take them as literally true and seethe with
an indignation which in the mass is mad-
ness. The object clearly is to inflame the
crowd to the point of voting in the desired
direction, though the people responsible
know, or should know, that the game has
elements of danger. A crowd brought to the
pitch of real hatred will in certain moods
stick at nothing at all; and when that point
is reached democracy itself is in great
danger. Disorder calls for a strong hand;
and a strong hand once exerted is rarely
a restrained hand. The creation of public
hysteria, for good reason or bad, has so often
led to the loss of citizen liberties that the
people who thus play upon the feelings ot
crowds can hardly be regarded as true friends
of democracy. But apart altogether from
the material dangers to the State which are
never wholly absent where crowd hysteria is
inflamed by exaggerated speech, the atmo-
sphere is not one in which democracy can
best do its work. Once in three years, or a
little oftener in actual practice, the citizens
are called upon to make an important choice.
That choice should be influenced by a careful
following from week to week of Parliamen-
tary and administrative affairs; but the
moment an election comes near such a torrent
of words is poured forth upon the electors,
such a flood of advice, persuasion and alleged
argument, that those about to cast a vote
are often entirely turned away from the
sober judgment on affairs they had formed
during the months of calm. Democracy is
not very robust now; it will become very
sick indeed if such methods are continued.
Compulsory voting does noting to abate the
evil. What is wanted is more thought, more
quiet, more definite and plain statement of
principles, especially at a time when poli-
ticians are not scrambling for seats.

Queensland Beef Cattle.
“W.P.D.”: “Retsam”(B. 24/9/‘25) is not
justified* in his statement that “the [beef]
export trade is admittedly dead” and that
the breeding and feeding of cattle are at fault
—that breeders do not pay sufficient atten-
tion to the quality of their herd bulls and
that “any old thing docs so long as it can
produce calves.” If “Retsamj” will look at any
of the journals published in the interests ot
Queensland stock-breeders he will see page
after page of finely illustrated advertisements
of cattle studs —shorthorns, Herefords, Aber-
deen-Angus and others. We have the Gun-
yan, Cressbrook, Canning Downs, Bellevue,
Graceinere and Lyndley Hereford studs;
the Lyndhurst, Kuyura, Yandilla, Canning
Downs South, Glenbar, Ruwenzori, Hidden
Vale, Calliope and other shorthorn
studs; and the East Talgai Aberdcen-
Angus. These breeders, who are not
in business merely for amusement, annu-
ally import high-grade stud bulls and cows,
and do not mind what they pay so long as
they get the best. The studs, with others
in N.S.W.. Victoria and South Aus., supply
cattle-stations with pedigreed and herd bulls
and cows, and thus constantly improve the
general standard. Cattlemen are not fools,
and they well know that a scrubber eats as
much as a well-bred beast, but brings a much
lower price at the meatworks. My own obser-
vations, backed up by some of the best cattle
judges in the State, convince me that the
all-round average of Queensland herds is
high and improving—one sees very few scrub-
bers. At the last Brisbane Show the beef
cattle of all kinds were of fine quality, and
year by year there is an advance. The Show
sales proved that buyers were willing to give
good prices for good animals : and although the
depression in the beef-exporting industry
accounted for more withdrawals than one
liked to see, most of the cattle not bought by
auction were afterwards cleared privately.
“Retsam” says that an Argentine steer two
years old will weigh as much as a bullock
five years old in Australia. If he had seen
the “baby beef” shown at the Brisbane Show
he might have been convinced that Queens-
land can produce two-year-old steers for ex-
port equal to any in the world. We do not
feed our stock on alfalfa (lucerne), as that
is an unreliable crop in Queensland; hut the:
Mitchell, Blue and Flinders grasses of the:
Central, Western and North-Western dis-
tricts are cattle feed than which there is no.
better. Lately I noticed 13 bullocks which
came from Terrick in the Blackall district.
They were under five years and averaged
over 11001 b. live weight. They sold for over
£ls each. Thirty years ago there were a
dozen or more large cattle-stations in
Queensland with big herds of shorthorns
superior to any (with, perhaps, one excep-
tion) now to be found. Then there was a.
distinct decline in quality for some time,,
but of late the standard has improved and
keeps on improving. I have seen mobs from
the Territory railed at Dajarra for Towns-
ville simply rolling fat although they had
travelled hundreds of miles, and on any of
the big Barkly Downs stations may be seen
cattle equally good. Queensland meatworks
have had a fairly good run this season, and
if some are not killing now it is not that
cattle are wanting, but that railway and
shipping strikes have made it impossible to
export beef at present. With industrial
peace the prospects for the future ure not
unhopeful, especially if carcases can b.e
shipped chilled.
The Perilous Vacuum.
“Feng-Siiui” : “Gregor” (B. 22/10/’25)
raises an important issue when lie says that
the existence close to Australia of the un-
developed territory of Dutch New Guinea
is a menace to the White Australia policy;
but his remedy is more curious than the two-
toed sloth. He proposes that the League of
Nations should be asked to give the Common-
wealth a voice in the future of this vast
Dutch colony. The harassed League has
troubles of its own, and few of its members
have any sympathy for the Australian mon-
opoly of an empty continent. Anyhow, what
does “Gregor” propose the sturdy Dutch-
man should be required to do? Must he
keep his portion of New Guinea empty be-
cause the Australians have empty spaces
they are too casual to develop? Or does he
suggest that the country of head-hunters,
impenetrable .iungle, malaria-ridden fore-
shores and lofty mountains should await
white settlement, like the patient Ivimberleys
or the expectant Northern Territory? Either
suggestion would raise polite snickers at the
League, and would stir the stolid Hollander
to frenzy. That able coloniser daily jeopar-
dises the proper digestion of liis rystafel in
an endeavor to populate his own empty
spaces, which are relatively as bulky as Aus-
tralia's. According to the census of _1920,
Java and Madura, with an area of. 50,554
square miles, accommodated nearly 35 mil-
lion people, while the outer dependencies,,
including Dutch New Guinea, gave elbow-
room of 685,846 square miles to a mere 14
millions. Many of these islands, clothed to
the water’s edge in forest, are potentially as
rich as Java, containing their own self-fer-
tilisers, in the shape of volcanoes, and hiding
in their interiors unknown resources in gold,
oil and coal; and the Dutchman is fully
alive to their importance. He also knows
vacuums have a habit of getting filled, and
has been watching for many years the poli-
tical advance of Japan towards his beloved
Insulind, and the economic march of China
in the same direction. The Javanese is a
feeble pioneer, and moves off the family hali-
buli with reluctance; nevertheless the enor-
mous pressure of population in the home
island, exceeding 700 people to the square
mile, and non-industrial at that, is slowly
pushing him abroad. In the meantime Aus-
tralia has business with her own unpopu-
lated areas.
A Continent without a Labor Party.
Canada is having a general election this
week, but the resultant Government will not
be Labor. The Canadian (trades unions,
though wealthy and powerful, have no use
for a Labor party on the Australian plan.
There were 235 seats in. the last Dominion
Parliament (there wall be 10 more in the
next), and they.were occupied by 117 Lib-
erals, 64 Progressives, 50 Conservatives and
4 Independents, one or two of whom called
themselves Laborites. The U.S. unions like-
wise reject, the idea of calling Parliamentary
Labor parties into existence. Some of the
organised U.S. workers vote for the Repub-
licans, others for the Democrats and others
again for the third party founded by La
Follette ; but all sections agree that they
would have nothing to gain as workers, and
a great deal to lose as citizens, by going in
for Labor politics of the Australian variety.
It follows that the U.S. trades unions reject
Moscow and all its works. The Federation
of Labor, greatest of American working-class
organisations, has steadfastly supported the
Washington Government in its refusal to re-
cognise the robber-Republic; supported the
Government, too. in its policy of deporting
foreign-born Red revolutionaries . and gaol-
ing native-born I.W.W. incendiaries, where-
as the Australian Labor party welcomes
them with open arms. The same Federa-
tion of Labor recently congratulated Have-
lock Wilson on the victory he has gained
in Britain over the Communists who started
the shipping strike —that strike .which, re-
gardless of the immense losses it is inflicting
on their own country and class, Australian
Laborites have encouraged in every. possible
way, even to the extent of refusing pilots and
police protection to ships’ companies who
might therewith succeed in carrying cargoes
of Australian produce to overseas markets.
The lines on which the American trade
unions are moving were explained to the
recent British Labor Conference at Scar-
borough :
Mr. Adamski, representing the American Federation
of Labor, related how 34 Labor banks had been
established under expert control. The unions had
now started their own insurance societies, which,

on a non-profit basis, could offer rates less than
those of the insurance corporations.
Mr. Evans, of the American Electrical Workers,
stated that co-operative investment societies
started by unions were giving credit for building
houses and business premises. He explained a re-
markable bond of .joint co-operation between railway
companies and unions. “Since the plan lias been
put into effect,” he declared, “grievances have been
reduced 75 per cent. It has brought about
stability of work, more employment, higher earn-
ings. closer co-operation, safer and more sanitary
conditions. We are moving forward more rapidly
than ever before.”
Continuing, he said that the American Labor
movement regarded the electrical power question as
inmeasurably the greatest industrial problem in the
world and was fighting side by side with munici-
palities, public-utility societies and farmers in the
battle for public control of super-power. “We are
blazing a new trail,” he exclaimed, as he pictured
American towns now in existence where there were
no factory chimneys and no house chimneys, and
where the profits on the widespread use of the town’s
electricity practically eliminated payment of taxes.
This programme is a bit different from the
Australian Labor policy of finding Gov-
ernment employment for all and sundry
pending the attainment of the Moscow objec-
tive. It doesn’t depend on incessant borrow-
ing from a war-stricken country which, at
latest advices, had 1,400,000 unemployed
on the dole, or on the formation of a Red
Army in which “useless discipline” is to
be abolished, officers are to be selected as
Labor candidates are, and the class-conscious
soldiery is to retain its weapons. But it
offers no attractions to a group which has
imported its leading doctrines from Russia.
If Australian trades unions went in for in-
dustrial banks, co-operative investment
societies, and friendly association with “the
master-class,” it would certainly do the rank
and file of workers great good, but the Labor
politician’s occupation would be gone.

From the waterfront: —
The strike of British seamen against their own
union, which agreed to accept the 1923 scale of
wages in view of the bitter condition of the British
carrying trade, has petered out in Britain, S’Africa,
Maoriland and other parts of the world. Every-
where, in fact, but the Commonwealth, where it
is being prolonged in the hope that the Labor party
will come into power, commandeer a fleet of mer-
chantmen and engage the strikers at Australian
rates of pay. In which event there will be a vast,
extension of the job-control policy, which has started
again in what is left of the Australian mercantile
marine in spite of the pledge that it would be
abandoned. It has been alleged that the strikers,
as a body, are veterans of 1914-18. Some of them
are, no doubt, but a large number are youngsters who
were at school during the war. And their wilder
spirits are not endearing themselves to the public by
hooting the Australian Prime Minister, howling down
speakers at election meetings and doing their darned-
est to strangle this country’s overseas trade and
close down factories dependent on overseas material,
in the intervals of lining up for their three meals
a day. But they struck a snag at Gladstone (Q.),
where, in association with the Seamen’s Union and
the local branch of the Waterside Workers’ Federa-
tion, they refused coal to the refrigerating plant on
the steamer Mahia, which carries £lOO,OOO worth
of perishable cargo, and molested guests of the
captain who were discussing wavs and means of
preserving the food. When the news went round
the district the farmers and graziers mu-tered in
force, and it was given out that 500 would assemble
on Wednesday (5000, if necessary) to coal the ship
and save the cargo. Thereupon the pallid Brisbane
Labor Government hurriedly interviewed the strike
committee, and that body, making a virtue of neces-
sity, intimated that the coal would be supplied.

The unanimous dislike of the British dele-
gation at the International Telegraph Con-
vention in Paris to a 20 per cent, increase
in transit rates on cables, and the equally
unanimous affection for the measure dis-
played by the other countries, had a reason
in the fact that more than 50 p.c. of the
world’s under-water communications are in
British hands, but are not all on British
territory. Coral atolls and desolate sand-
spits belonging to alien Powers have occa-
, sionally been the only convenient inter-
mediate stations on the main routes to John
Bull’s overseas possessions, and in return
for providing ordered government the alien
Powers deduct the maximum permissible
amount per word from every message that
passes on its way. Sometimes the govern-
ment isn’t as ordered as it might be, but the
exaction goes on just the same, and the in-
ternational accounts, in which the reckon-
ing between the multitudinous administra-
tions is annually settled, are cast in strange
coinages. A discrepancy of ten cents or half
a katip is hounded round the globe for years
if necessary, but the balance is usually in
favor of the foreign administration, and the
revenue obtained from inter-imperial corres-
pondence keeps many a needy Government
in cigarettes. Australia in particular pays
heavily for the convenience. In this direction
wireless scores over the cables. No country
has yet had the nerve to demand a levy for
the use of its ether particles by other admin-
istrations. The 20 p.c. increase in the tran-
sit rates should give the beam people a useful
handicap in the coming rate-war with the
o-»blc companies.

the wrong number, no assistance can be
promised for at least two years. It is a
pity, for radio, even under the present
faulty conditions, is a great boon to the
Outback. On a recent extensive tour of
the southern districts I listened in on
expensive multi-valved receiving sets in
various places. The results were generally
poor owing to interference from the lawless
lightning and the übiquitous static. One
situated on Mount Kosciusko, probably the
highest in Australia, promised well on
account of its situation; but although I
heard Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and
Sydney whisper in a ghostly fashion, the
experience was more a curiosity than an
entertainment. The matter calls for action.
As a means of making the country more
attractive to live in and of breaking the
Million City’s gross monopoly of the good
things, radio is very valuable. What is

“M.M.G.”: If Francis Jackson (B.
S./10/’25) and Nell Gray (B. 15/10/’25)
are giving plain, unvarnished accounts of
conditions on the Bay liners on which they
travelled, one can only conclude that all the
ships are not run in the same way. As one
who put in six weeks on one of these boats,
1 have to agree with Francis Jackson.
The attitude of the stewards towards the
mere passengers was appalling; no other
word describes it. Complaints at the pur-
ser’s office were met with the insulting query.
“What do you expect on a third-class boat?”
A wave of silent approval and admiration for
one lady’s courage swept the ship when she
answered very sweetly : “A third-class purser,
I suppose.” Certainly some stewards were
less rude than others. The facetious one
who dug the passengers in the ribs with his
thumb and said, “What’s your next, gents.?”
was not in command at our table, but then
we couldn’t expect to have everything. Ours
had an unhappy habit of filling iip the glasses
for the second sitting with the limejuice re-
maining in those from the first sitting. It
took some passengers the full six weeks to
become accustomed to using the one knife
for cutting meat, helping the grey, half-cold
potatoes from the great leaden-colored
“trough” in the centre of the table, slicing
bread, spreading butter and peeling fruit.
The mid-day meal was timed for noon, but
frequently it was served a quarter of an
hour early. Then the late-comers were fol-
lowed to their places by the steward in charge
of the saloon, and a moneybox pushed under
their noses. A fine for unpunctuality was
extorted in this manner!

“Oxmead” : My recollections of Austen
Chamberlain, who has been looming larger
in the English press since Locarno than
Baldwin or anyone else, go back to Rugby
and finish there. He was a somewhat loosely-
knit youth, of any type except that of which
school heroes are fashioned, because of his
pronounced aversion, almost amounting to
contempt, for games and athletics. He was
studious, and. even then, something of a de-
bater, but not in the first flight of scholars
by the public-school standards of those days.
I note that he has since modestly admitted
that his Latin verses were bad and his Greek
ones hopeless. A somewhat colorless figure
he seems across the years, one which would
have beeu studied with more interest if his
fellows had suspected he was destined to de-
velop into one of Britain’s foremost states-
men. In those days we never anticipated
that distinction even for Austen’s father,
Joseph, the embodiment of Birmingham
Radicalism. Yet Joseph almost certainly
would have succeeded Gladstone as Liberal
leader but for the Home Rule, split, and his
son came very near to succeeding to the
Conservative leadership when Balfour retired
and Bonar Law was appointed as a way of
preventing party division over the respective
claims of Austen and the late Lord Long.
The two generations of Chamberlain have
gone nearer to the very top of the Parliamen-
tary ladder than any contemporary family-—-
unless it be the Churchills, Randolph and
Winston.

“R.H.”: Battling for charities is my re-
ligion. I therefore want to take “Temsee”
(B. 8/10/’25) by the hand. In a harsh and
bitter voice, though his fine solicitude for
poverty-stricken old age shows that his
nature is neither harsh nor bitter, he com-
plains about the “homes” which accommo-
date Melbourne’s aged and infirm of both
sexes. He does not name any particular
home, but in a general way scathingly in-
dicts “a number of institutions in and
around Melbourne” in which “hundreds of
helpless paupers drag out their closing
years.” He probably has one particular in-
stitution in mind. Why may we not have
the name of it? “Temsee” is saying too much
oi- too little. Let me paint a companion pic-
ture in more pleasant colors. Come with me
to a home in which are broken gentlemen,
clerks, old soldiers, tradesmen, laborers.
Some are total wrecks, others comparatively
erect and sprightly. Look at them as they
sit about, chatting merrily or contentedly
smoking. Some certainly look dazed and de-
jected ; but the crowd as a whole, whether
speaking up well or looking on with a senile
expression of weariness, must be described as
happy and comfortable. This institution is
the Home of the Little Sisters of the Poor,
spacious, easily accessible, and command-
ingly situated at Northeote, seven miles out
from Melbourne. Established 40 years
ago, it now houses 240 men and women of
ripe old age who have fought their battle
and have come here for relief from the too
arduous struggle that is going on outside.
It receives not a penny of Government
money; it depends entirely upon charity.
Its work is admired by all who know any-
thing about it. It has no paid staff. The
nuns who carry it on receive no earthly fee
or reward. When there are large-souled. re-
fined and educated ladies like the Little
Sisters of the Poor picking up and rescuing
from the raging waters poor old folks who,
gasping and struggling to keep themselves
afloat, had almost gone under, it seems only
a fair thing to ask “Temsee” to qualify his
well-meant complaint.^
The hope of sundry Melbourne art enthusi-
asts that when the Governor-General goes
to Canberra Government House may be con-
verted into a National Gallery is a very
frail one. The lease of Stonington, where
the State Excellency enjoys life, runs out in
April, 1928, and the State Government
favors letting that expensive place go and
making the towered mansion in the Domain
the abode of the local rubber-stamp. Any-
way, the building is very doubtfully suitable
for an art gallery; it would have to be torn
to pieces and remodelled. The present Com-
monwealth Parliament House would be much
more suitable, if the State Parliament could
be induced to forego a return to it; but that
is not at all likely to happen. Melbourne
badly needs a decent gallery, but it would
be better to centralise effort upon a new
building than to indulge in vague hopes
about the conversion of existing ones.

“PiPARD.s” : The Spaniard De la Cierva’s
"autogyro” is described by British experts as
"the most important step in aero-dynamics
since the days of the Wright brothers” and
“the most wonderful thing in aeronautical
invention in any living person’s lifetime.”
This is only another proof that the nations
which are most patently decadent and have
almost ceased to count in national rivalry
are as likely to throw up arresting personali-
ties, men who can translate brain-power into
achievement, as those which are in the zenith
of their power. Except, perhaps, the Wright
brothers, nobody ranks higher among the
pioneers of flying than Santos Dumont, the
Brazilian, who was more Portuguese than
anything else. A few years ago Cuba gave
the world a chess champion in Capablanca
■ —Spanish with a dash. And Crete, the
scene of a high civilisation that perished
thousands of years ago—an island that no-
body expects to produce anything much ex-
cept oranges nowadays—suddenly came to
light with a Venizelos who might have been
the regenerator of Greece if that job weren't
beyond any mere human being, and who at
least came nearer to being its saviour than
anyone has done since the heroic ages. Per-
haps, after all, we smile a little too readily
at the claims made now and then regarding
discoveries in physics reputed to have been
made by . our own aborigines— David
Unaipon, the S. Australian, for example.

“Bokom” : The traffic in forbidden drugs is
usually lucrative. There is a Sydney opera-
tor who buys cocaine hydrochloride whole-
sale at about 30s. an ounce. To each ounce he
adds one and a half times its bulk of some
such adulterant as sugar of milk or boracie
acid, and then divides it up into little packets
containing allegedly ten grains—actually
four of cocaine. These sell readily at ss.
apiece, returning him a profit of about 1900
per cent, on the original outlay. Yet when-
ever the Law is energetic enough to lay one
of these dope-sellers by the heels, which is
not very often, the penalty meted out is
generally a paltry fine of probably less than
the profits of a few hours’ trading,

“X2X”: Some idea of the extent of the
opium traffic in Australia may be gained from
the fact that in the year ended June 30 last
14741 b. of the drug was seized in the prin-
cipal ports. And it may be taken for granted
that if only one consignment in every five
was captured by the authorities, those behind
the traffic would soon give it up as a bad job.
More than 20 years have now passed since
opium was declared a prohibited import and
its possession made illegal, and in that period
the traffic has so grown that to-day more of
it is seized annually than was smoked in a
year when it could be openly bought. The
greatest part of the smuggled stuff comes in
through the North, where there are long
stretches of unguarded coast —and are likely
to be unguarded until the Commonwealth sup-
plies the means to lead population up that
way.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Federal Labor-leader Charlton declared in
Sydney that “farmers’ co-operative unions in
all the wheat-producing States recently de-
clared in favor of a compulsory wheat pool
to be controlled by the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment. The assertion was promptly denied,
as regards Westralia, by the big co-operative
concern which runs the voluntary wheat pool
in that State. A few days later S. Aus.
Labor Premier Gunn introduced a bill pro-
viding for the continuance of voluntary
wheat pools, remarking that a vote taken by
the S.A. Farmers’ Union showed that * prac-
tically every farmer who sent in a paper
wanted the voluntary pools to go on. The
Vic. Government, which is 50 p.c. Farmers
Union, has also put through more voluntary-
pool legislation. A Labor politician who
wants to butt into the risky business ot
wheat control should at least try to get las
facts right, instead of relying on his imagina-
tion for them.
To show its power the Seamen’s Union,
decided last week that no oversea vessel in
Sydney may be coaled. If the bosses of the
Seamen’s Union think they are the only
handful of people in the world who can make
a mess of civilisation they are quite wrong.
Any one of a thousand small groups could
do it, just as if every man who could punch
Tom Walsh on the nose did it, Tom Walsh
wouldn’t smell anything any more. The fact
tiiat Tom Walsh’s nose —along with the
writer’s —is left in good working order is
simply due to the fact that 999 men out ot
every 1000 have a saner idea of good citizen-
ship than these Bolsheviks of the Seamen’s
Union.
One of these cloudy benevolences which
arouse suspicion is the promise of Federal
Labor that if it comes home in triumph with
the band playing it will try its hand at con-
trolling the export of farm produce. It
will “attend to the requirements of the citi-
zens of the Commonwealth before permitting
the exportation of foodstuffs and materials
to oversea countries.” The idea seems to
be to allow exportation only under permit,
obtainable from possibly corrupt officials
of the right color. By going slow on the
issue of permits so as to keep the local
market glutted people may get cheaper food,
but the farmer will get less for his output.
There will be losses, too, through paying
storage on the glut, and a good deal may go
bad through being kept while Matthew Charl-
ton, miner, and J. E. West, plumber, and
Parker Maloney, estate-agent, are making
sure that the local supply is adequate.
The latest brick of doubt flung at tlm
“pacific settlement of international disputes’"
via the League comes from League-member
Greece, who, after firing an -ultimatum into
Bulgaria concerning the alleged shooting of
a sentry, invaded the countrv without wait-
ing for an answer. And Italy did precisely
the same to Greece in 1923. The peaceful
settlement of disputes is a beautiful aspira-
tion. The danger is that the other fellow
is always forgetting about it.
The sale of a small Commonwealth cloth-
factory at Geelong has inspired some lofty
romancers, but Parker Maloney, M.H.K. for
Hume (N.S.Ws)j has outsoated all the rest.
Tiie Abu reports him as follows i—

during the war on the manufacture tif soldiers
materials, and their annual profits for the people
never averaged, less than £B.<J;ot)o, besides siipplvi ng
material at haif the price chajgcd by Flinders-lanb.
The manager’s report for 102 i gives the tdtal
value of the output for the war years as
under: —

1917- .. 145,275 9 0
1918- .. 174,019 3 4
A man who can conjure up a saving of “over
£4,000,000” and a protit of "never less” than
£BO,OOO a year on an output officially valued
at £514,127 for four years lias too vivid
an imagination for politics. Hu ought to be
writing scenarios for the moving-pictures.
Having wrecked the Queensland Arbitra-
tion Court by raising wages by Act of Par-
liament, granting at the demand of strikers
i ss. p.w. increase which the Court had re-
.used, the Gillies Government finished the
job by formally abolishing the Court, put-
ting in its place a Board of Trade. (Inci-
dentally, the Lang Government, which also
claims to be Labor, is abolishing the N.S.W.
Board of Trade.) The bill establishing the
Board was introduced by Kirwan, the Minis-
ter of Works, who explained that the “tri-
bunal” would have a puisne Judge for pre-
sident and two lay members, who would draw
£2OOO p.a. apiece for seven years: "parti-
sans will not be appointed,” lie added. There-
THE MANGO TRICK.
“The Premier of Queensland (Mr. Gillies) has resigned to accept a seat at £2000 a year on the
Board of Arbitration just created by his Government. Mr. Dunstan, one of his colleagues, accepts
the second seat at the same salary.”
THE MAGICIAN: “And now, dear Comrade, having made the tree to grow, we will
proceed to pluck the fruit.”
upon caucus appointed Gillies, head of the
Government which increased wages by Act
of Parliament, as ordered by its striking
employees; and Dunstan, Queensland boss of
the Australian Workers’ Union. In the his-
tory of political jobbery there lias been no-
thing ranker, but Queensland was in no wise
astonished. It has lost the capacity for feel-
ing astonishment at the effrontery of Labor
politicians.
When Morley’s Tote Bill was squelched
by Vic. Assembly in August, 11)22, it was
thought that no further attempt at legalisa-
tion of the machine would be made for at
least seven years, but the Composite Cabinet,
spurred on by supporters, now proposes to
submit a measure to take effect next year.
Mainly because railway rates on agricul-
tural products were reduced, the Ministry is
short £200,000 of the amount required to
balance the ledger on June 30, 1926. It pro-
poses to get this £200,000, and £87,000 be-
sides, by adding a penny in the pound to the
rates on personally-earned incomes and tup-
pence to those on incomes from property and
company profits. Someone is pretty sure to
point out that makeshift totalisators could
be installed in time to drag in a large portion
of the required £200,000 by June 30—the
N.S.W. Government derived £221,341 from
ten metropolitan clubs last year. However,
N.S.W. is hot a good example for supporters
of the tote to foiiow, inasmuch as in one way
and another 13.83 p.C. was deducted from
£2,459,316 speculated with those ten clubs.
That is not giving the machine a fair chance.
Prime Minister Bruce sent one of his polite
messages to the new Premier McCormack, of
Queensland, asking if something could be
done in the matter of four steamers with per-
ishable meat cargoes on board, which are de-
tained in Queensland ports by industrial
troubles. He received the kind of reply that he
might have looked for—the sort he got from
Collier of Westralia, though McCormack
doesn’t add a demand for a large Federal
subsidy as Collier does
The Queensland Government will maintain law and
order in a constitutional manner, and without any
outside interference or suggestion from the Com-
monwealth Government.
McCormack has thus got so far that lie views
Federated Australia as “outside.”
The £2OOO a year which is to be paid to
Gillies and Dunstan in Queensland is the
least serious part of the matter. Even
Labor Ministers might easily be worth £2OOO
a year. The really serious part of the un-
savory business is that these two strenuous
Laborites —both of them have been union
organisers—are to be two-thirds of the new
Board of Trade and Arbitration which is to
supersede the State Arbitration Court, ihey
are thus to have practical control over the
industries of Queensland; and, lest they
might think themselves safe in their seven-
year job and proceed without regard for the
feelings of the crowd, it has been provided
that Parliament —a one-House Parliament--
may sack them at any moment. When it
makes such appointments on such conditions,
Queensland can't expect people to feel secure
enough to put money into Northern enter-
prises.
Westralian finance is complex:—
The revenue was £217,141 more than was ex-
pected.
The year's deficit was only £58,398, and as the-
sinking fund increased by £611,459 the net result,
was really a surplus of over £550,000.
There is an accumulated deficit, piled up during;
a dozen or more years of low taxation and premedi-
tated poverty, but the sinking fund far outweighs,
it. Westralia’s sinking fund is bigger than those of
all the other States put together.
Such small shortage as there was foi the year
( £58,398) was helped by a deliberate reduction
of taxation, already below the average, the super-
tax on incomes being cut down, by one-half.
The railways did better than in the previous year,,
and in the previous year they returned £4 18s..
per cent, on the capital invested, whereas the Aus-
tralian average was £4 per cent.
The last harvest was a record, and the 44-hour
week is to be introduced even for agricultural,
laborers, the State being allegedly quite rich enough,
to stand it.
Still W.A. Premier Collier fiercely demands
a subsidy of £450,000 per annum at the cost
of the States generally, on the plea ot pov-
erty and possibly child desertion. Moreover,
he expects another technical deficit
(£98,079) next June. An annual shortage is.
the Lazarus sore on which is based the mov-
ing tale of injury suffered through Federa-
tion. To lose it would be bleak calamity.
The Federal Supreme Court of the U.S.,
which has the right to pass judgment on the
validity of State laws, has decided that the
anti-Communist statute of California, under
wliich over 100 men and women are "doing:
time,” is good. Wherefore it decreed that
the appellant, Charlotte Whitney, must di>
her 14 years’ gaol for “membership and
attendance at Communist meetings.” So the
lady’s friends will presumably either swear
off or take their tickets for this side, where
in due course they will probably get a Laboi
nomination for the Senate.
How the British Government does things
at Glasgow, where Walsh comes from. 4 he-
news is in a cable of Thursday last:
Nine aliens were detained after a secret raid at
Glasgow. They included a local Communist and two.
women. The aliens arrested at Clydeside compiise
two families. They were placed aboard a Russian
steamer at London, and sail for Russia to-day, guaiuecL
in the meantime by officers from Scotland Yard.
Even tlie Spartan, famed for his brevity,
wasn’t much more brief than that.
Salaries and perks of State Ministers and.
members in Vic. are much more modest than
they are in the Ma State. The total appro-
priations are: Ministers, £lO,OOO (of which
Allan takes £1450, Peacock £1350, and the
other six stipendiary Ministers £l2OO each);
57 private members of the Assembly (£5OO
each), £28,500; Speaker, £1200; Chairman
of Committees, £740; 30 members of the Leg-
Council (£2OO each), £6000; six members,
of the Railway Committee, £l5OO (aggre-
gate) • seven members of Public Accounts
Committee, £2lO (aggregate) ; Council Presi-
dent, £750 ; Council Chairman of Committees,
£4OO. The big rises just given to N.S.YV.
Ministers and members have pade their
Vic. cousins green with envy; but any
attempt at a grab without consulting tlie
electors would cause a cyclone.
Jack McNeill, the accidental Labor mem-
ber for Wannon (Vic.), is preparing to take
a long farewell of that electorate, which is
mostly Western District wheat, with a bit
of coastal butter and spuds. Anti-war poet
McDougall represented Wannon m two Par-
liaments, but A. S. Rodgers wrested tlie seat
from him in 1913, and retained it at three
succeeding elections, liis majorities being
•>513 2177, 2709 and 2229. In 1922, how-
ever,’ there was bad blood between the
Nationalists and the Cockies, and although
McNeill polled only 10,795 primaries out
of 26 261, he got enough Cocky contingent
votes to put him 407 ahead of Rodgers—
-13 334 to 12,927. This time the Nat. h ed-
eration and the Farmers’ Union are recom-
mending an exchange of preferences between
Rodgers, who is a Horsham man, and An-
derson, a Dimboola farmer, and McNeills
chance of being bumped out is excellent.
A Melbourne Judge, handing out a penalty
to a youth under the Federal Crimes, Act,
recorded a sentence of three months im-
prisonment, and was suspending it, m con
sideration of a statutory undertaking to be
of good behavior for 12 months, when he was
reminded that he couldn’t do anything of the
>sort _l lo could only bind the offender over
for a period equal to the term of imprison-
ment suspended. The young man, under
the fear of the consequence of a break, may
be just getting into the habit of being decent
when, at the end of an inadequate period,
the restraint is removed from him. Queens-
land is the one State with sensible laws
concerning the suspended sentence; however
short the sentence may be, the least period
for which an offender can be bound over is
twelve months.

A FABLE FOR STRIKERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Goaded by strikes, the farmers struck.
They said: “We will not grow the corn,
Nor place a bullock in a truck,
Nor drive a hoof, nor turn a horn.
The squatters said: “The sheep may breed
In pleasant pastures hot or cool;
Hereafter we shall give no heed
To thoughts of mutton or of wool.”
The plough lay rusting by the fence
Near gaps that cattle crossed at will;
The rabbits browsed, the weeds grew dense,
The country railway yards were still.
The butter-factory was closed,
The pig-pen doors were open wide,
While restful epics were composed
To pastoral slumber deified.
The farmers turned in easy sleep ;
They worked one hour in every day
And always had enough to keep
All want and famine well at bar’.
And so they simply stayed on strike
And heard the distant unions roar
Until the noise they made was like
No other protest heard before.
But soon the sound to silence died ;
Men cannot yell who live on air.
The cities, humbled in their pride,
Pleaded for terms in their despair.
“Our terms are these,” the farmers said ;
“You stick to work and see it through.
Learn that the men who give you bread
Can go on strike as well as you.”

metals, although they were a big factor last
year in beating the 1924 profits by £80,156.
It is partly the reward of skill and zeal
allied with organisation in the control and
development of an industry which in pre-
war days was almost the monopoly of con-
tinental Europe, and that meant chiefly Ger-
many and largely German-controlled plants
in Belgium.
After registration as a proprietary in 1916,
the first couple of years of this co. were
occupied in preliminary and experimental
work at Risdon and elsewhere. Results were
satisfactory, and in 1918 it was decided to
go ahead. That meant money. The want
was met by Amalgamated Zinc, Zinc Corp.
and the North and South B. 11. cos.; they
took £1,10Q,000 worth of S p.c. cum. prefs.
which follow the ords. in any distribution
above that rate. Later £400,000 of first-
mortgage debentures were issued. Since then
prices have encouraged production, and qual-
ity—the zinc is 99.95 p.c. pure—has ensured
a ready sale for output at a premium over
G. 0.8. spelter in free competition with zinc
from other producing countries. This is
something for the co. to grow enthusiastic
about. Really Australia isn’t half proud
enough of its chemists and engineers. In
the metallurgy of lead and zinc, at any rate,
they have been responsible for nearly all the
great progress the world has witnessed dur-
ing the past 25 or 30 years.
The bulk of ore supplies comes from
Broken Hill and is pre-roasted before ship-
ment to Risdon, a deep-water port on the
river above Hobart. This exposes the co.’s
operations to a wide field of possible indus-
trial disturbance. Although conditions at
the Barrier are quieter than they have been
for years, the same cannot be said of ship-
ping. That the management is alive to pos-
sibilities is seen in the £590,976 of concen-
trates, ores and by-products on hand,
£366,612 greater than in 1924. Spelter (com-
mercial zinc) is the backbone of activities,
but the treatment and utilisation of by-
products fattens the income. The sulphuric
acid and superphosphate plants at Risdon
were completed during the year, and are
working up to expectations. This means than
the gases from the roasters at the Risdon
plant are now made to earn money. From
October, 1924, to the close of the accounts,
7090 of the 12,305 tons of superphosphates
produced were sold, and the acid plant is to
be increased in case the demand grows. Also
zinc recovery has been improved by an ex-
tension of the flotation process. Formerly it
was found that the roasters failed to com-
pletely desulphurise some of the coarser par-
ticles in the feed. Most of these are now
recovered and roasted in the Risdon furnaces,
the sulphur dioxide being used in super,
manufacture. Wherever there is a loss
general-manager Gepp and his technical staff
are after it like bloodhounds.
Production over the last three years has
grown in this way :

1925.. 46,929 929,500 7030 168 256
The average daily output of spelter was 126]
tons, or three and a half tons better than the
1924 average. What that means can be
guessed from the following figures showing
average metal prices to June 80: —

And so far Fortune in the current year has
had no black looks for the co.; in fact, her
smile broadens. Spelter went to £B7 Is. 6d.
in September, with lead at £B7 12s. lOd. and
silver 2s. 9.98 d. That arouses a suspicion
that there might be a nice little nest-egg in
the half-million odd of stocks on hand at
June 30. Prices are of vital interest, and
there seems to be a fair margin there. Ex-
cept for small additions and modifications
the main building programme is complete;
and that has helped balance-sheet figures:—

The balance of uncalled capital (£104,710)
came in toward the close of the accounts,
bringing the total to 2 8-5 million pounds.
Apart from provision for taxation, visible
reserves and undivided profits, including the
£442.727 at credit of depreciation and re-
newals account, have grown by £722,256 in
the last three years, and totalled £888,716 at
June 30. But you mustn’t take much notice
of that; for the reserves are in plant, etc.,
chiefly, and the value of that depends on the
maintenance of profits. Dividends have
marched to the tune of production and prices.
The ords. got their first taste in an 8 p.c.
p.a. distribution in the last half of 1928,
followed by 9 p.c. p.a. in the next year, with
10 p.c. p.a. last year, and a payment has
been made since the close of the accounts at
the rate of 12 p.c. p.a. The 350,000 deferred
ordinaries, issued as purchase consideration
to the Mt. Head-Rosebery Mines, Ltd., for
the Tas. West Coast properties, have to he
fed now. They participated for the first
time in that last 12 p.c. distribution; the
deferment expired on July 81. On present
capital (£2,000,000) a 12 p.c. div. will call
for £812,000, or £81,573 less than last year's
profit, after allowing for the £148,536
written off. The scrip has been popular in
the market of late; and on the technical
efficiency , , of the staff and works, metal
market prospects, and the development of
Broken Hill and other ore-supplies optimism
seems justified. But costs are still high.

In the beginning the co. took a risk. The
N.S.W. Parliament would not assist the in-
fant field, so the promoters had no difficulty in
getting its bill through, W. P. MacGregor,
who became an M.L.A. for the purpose,
shepherding the measure. Incidentally, lie
saw to it that the co. was protected against
unfair expropriation in the future, getting
a provision in the bill that the State might
only take the property by paying 21 times
the average annual profit for the preceding
seven years. From the commencement share-
holders have won a glittering chain of divs.,
the 1913 distribution being equal to 267] p.c.
on actual capital subscribed. Last year’s
Hi P-c. looks modest enough, but this piece
of potted history gilds it:—
1886—Co. registered; paid capital £46,800, plus
£16,000 in promoters’ shares.
1888— First stock watering; £41,860 capitalised
(two shares for every three).
1889 — Second stock watering; £17,433 (one in six).
Third stock watering, £15,273 (one in
eight).
1890— Fourth stock watering, £27,473 (one in five).
1891— Fifth stock watering, £32,967 (one in five).
1910—Sixth stock watering, £52,194 (one in four).
1920—Seventh stock watering, £250,000 (one for
one).
Which shows that the reward for the bold
venture of 1886 has been £437,200 of bonus
scrip and a wonderful run of divs. There
lias been wisdom in the co.’s management:
it early interested the big men of the Barrier
cos., its chief customers; and it has always
been willing to see that its workers had
enough to buy a pint of beer. The line itself
is a mere 36-mile link with the S. Aus. sys-
tem. Ail its traffic is through traffic; hence
it has always been able to make favorable
comparisons in the matter of freight.
Again and again the prosperity, even the
life, of the co. has been threatened. More
than once the approaching end of the Broken
Hill mines, upon which it is utterly depen-
dent, has been foretold. At the present
moment that end seems further away than
ever it was. Now, however, the co. is threat-
ened from another quarter. By the end of
next year Broken Hill will be linked with
Sydney by rail. Nobody knows quite what
that will mean. But it seems unlikely that
the Governments will allow a small section
of the track from Sydney to Perth to be in
private hands. Which means that the Gov-
ernment or Governments will either buy out
the co. or build another line. But when
this line is built it will certainly not be
narrow-gauge: and it will also certainly be
part of a through standard-gauge line from
Broken Hill to Pt., Augusta. Now, the great
smelting works, etc., are at Pt. Pirie, which
is further south ; so it is not at all certain
that this co. will lose a pound of it. 4 present
mine traffic. There will be a little general
traffic from Sydney to Broken Hill, but not
very much more than enough to keep the
guard in whistles.
A rich harvest was won in 1924. The
directors apologised profusely when notify-
ing that tlie 20 p.e. then paid could not be
maintained, but the 11] p.c. of last year
was not too dusty. Industrial troubles
affected earnings, but the directors count on
peace until at least the end of next year.

For the good of co-operation in general and
of dairying in particular, the long-sought
union with the Berrima Co. has been
achieved. But that achievement and an im-
provement in earnings lie this side of the
closing of the accounts. The year’s opera-
tions to March 31 had been unsatisfactory,
and not since 1901 has the profit been so
low. It was not that the business fell off,
but that one line crashed. The directors
state it frankly :
The Society has effected a revolution in the market-
ing and export of eggs. 4* million dozen being handled
for the year; but in its over-zeal to sull further
safeguard this industry it incurred a loss by entering
upon the dressed-poultry trade.

The union of the two cos. should yield sub-
stantial economies; and that, after all, is
the principal thing to be aimed at in a co-
operative co. of this sort. Profits don’t mean
much: they may be swollen by the simple
process of underpaying the co-operators. It
is the expense rate that matters; and it
cannot he said that the movement of late
years has been anything to throw hand-
springs about.

In past years shareholders left much of their
profits to accumulate, which in the ordinary
course of prudent business meant an income
that made a high rate of dividend almost
compulsory. Of late years there have been
a few transfers of these undivided profits to
capital; and it wouldn’t do any harm if a
bit more was done in that way. As a
matter of fact there is precious little in-
ducement these times for directors to leave
large amounts of profit in their business as
reserves. If they do, and thereafter increase
the dividend in order to give the share-
holders a return on the money, there is an
outcry about extortion, and the 15 or 20
per cent, is quoted. Here is a case where
through self-denial during very many of
the early years of the co. the reserves were
built up to twice the capital: that is to say,
a 15 p.c. dividend then actually meant that
the shareholders were getting only 5 p.c.
on the money they had at risk in the busi-
ness. Tlad no reserves been capitalised, a
15 p.c. div. would actually mean only 2*
p.c. now. Companies, and especially insur-
ance cos., ought to be encouraged to put by
large sums to reserves; for the higher you
pile your capital the more you will want
to pay away in dividends- —that is almost
inevitable. And the more you pay away
in divs. the more you must charge the
public, as a rule, for your services, what-
ever they are. But politicians and other
people will have to be educated in finance
before it will pay cos. always to do the
prudent thing. Indeed, as said just now, it
often pays them better to do the imprudent
thing, transfer as much profit as possible
to capital and thus keep the rate of dividend
down. Meantime what ought to lie ham-
mered into the general public’s head is that
a high rate of dividend doesn’t necessarily
mean that the co. is a bit more rapacious
than a co. which is paying only a quarter
of that rate.

Even the boom years did not see such a
volume of business, and its quality was good,
judging by the smaller claims. Expenses
hovered around the recent average. In addi-
tion to its fat underwriting surplus the co.
drew £19,390 from its investments, so that
the insurance business was called oil to
supply only £3096 towards the 15 p.c, div.
The large margin is very comforting to share-
holders and policy-holders alike. Inciden-
tally. the investments don’t worry the "Wild
Cat’’ like they used to. Their disposition

In 1914 mortgages were almost half total
assets; on June 30 they were only 6 p.c.
Total funds are in excess of twice the amount
of last year’s net premium income. The re-
serve for un expired risks (£90,000) was
more than the 40 p.c. usually looked upon
as necessary, and there were additional re-
serves aggregating £214,118. Policy-holders
can see so much security there that it is
almost unnecessary to point out that £850,000
of capital is callable.

Newcastle this little concern was faltering
along, paying precarious 5 p.c. and
trying to tinker the sorry smash of the nine-
ties. Business has steadily improved since
1912. Divs. were raised to 7 p.c. m 1911,
and in the next decade the books were cleared
of the rubbish and reserves were accumu-
lated. For the past three years 8 p.c. has
been paid. The clearance of old properties re-
leased money for more profitable use, and
the growing industrial development of the
coal city created a demand for home pro-
perties. Profits are treble the amount dis-
closed 15 years ago, but the improvement, m
the balance-sheet position is more im-
portant :

Vic.’s State coal-mine at Wonthaggi is
pretty sick. It is bad enough to know that
at the most there is only about 30 years of
commercially workable coal in the field with-
out having to face a loss for the year of
£79,732, which would have been much greater
but for a subsidy of £BO,OOO from the Rail-
ways Department. To a great extent last
year’s loss was caused ,by the. fire in the
Mcßride tunnel, the main working; but even
allowing for that things are very unsatisfac-
tory. Auditor-General Norris in his latest
report says: ‘"An analysis of the past
five years’ operations shows that to meet
working costs, to provide for the areas ex-
hausted, and pay interest and sinking fund
on the capital, the mine requires an aver-
age price at the pit’s mouth for all coal —
screened, unscreened .and slack —of 225. 9d.
a ton.” Last year the price averaged over
all 20s. lid. a ton. Norrisi adds : “The rates
fixed by the Railway Commissioners are
based on the value of the coal to the Depart-
ment ; and unless values are increased or
working expenses are reduced and the out-
put materially increased, it is difficult to see
how the mine will pay its way without sup-
plementary payments or subsidies.” To ask
for increased output and reduced costs from
a Government concern is expecting rather
much these days. And with the subsidy
habit almost incurable, prospects for recov-
ery are poor.
* * * *
“Gabba”: While “Lead Zinc” may be
justified in criticising (B. 15/10/’25) the
rather empiric estimate of £4 a ton profit on
Ibus ore from Mt. Isa Prop., those interested
in the field should not lose sight of several
relevant facts: (1) The values quoted for
Ibus —5.92 lead, 13.9 zinc and 4oz. silver—
were the bore-assay results covering a true
width of lode of about 200 ft. In the sulphide
zone this is not going to be taken out holus-
bolus. Everyone conversant with the field
knows that the Mt. Isa lodes are interlsimi-
nated with poor shales and slates ; certainly
they carry values, but they must be discarded
in any system of mining except opencut. To
compare the bore records of 200 ft. of variable
lode with the value of Broken Hill South ore
as mined is absurd. No one can say what
the thickness discarded will ultimately be,
but probably not less than one-third of the
200 ft. Value of ore mined is certain to be
much better than the bore values. (2) There
are several high-grade lodes on the field, such
as the Black Rock and Rio Grande, from
one or both of which the cos.—if they con-
tinue separately—will draw ore reserves.
Black Rock averaged 28 p.c. lead and 15oz.
silver (gross value almost £l2) over a width
of 30ft. for the first 150 ft. vertically. (3) The
Mt. Isa ore is closer to the surface than the
B. H. South’s, which means cheaper mining.
Also Isa ore is free from several impurities
characteristic of the Hill. Incidentally, Min-
ister Larcombe has been piloting the Mt. Isa
railway bill through the House this week.
* * * *
The Lander Co., at Orallo (Q.), has been
dogged with hard luck. Broken casing and
broken tools have been the order of the day
and fishing is still in progress. This has not
allayed the old rumor in Roma that certain
American oil interests are surreptitiously
operating to prevent any possible discovery
of a gusher there. R. E. Allan is still carry-
ing on| and hopes to get the hole tested next
month. His hopes have been smashed pre-
viously, but that hasn’t been his fault.
* * * *
Mt. Coolon (Q.) is still jogging along at
its sleepy pace, although it has the biggest
lode worked in Queensland at present. The
proposed big co. that didn’t eventuate last
year—mouths were opened too wide —has
aroused interest locally, and the Mt. Coolon
co. now proposes to sink an additional 100 ft.
and test the lode at that level. It is a be-
lated move, but warranted on the size and
value of the lode so far disclosed.
Joe Millican and a Sydney group led by
Fred Oertel hope to revive the Koorboora
tin-reefing field, Herberton (Q.). Of the
200,000 7s. 6d. shares 80,000 will go to the
vendor’s syndicate. Leases to be taken over
cover 160 acres, and include the Two Jacks,
Three Jacks, Fairplay, Tennyson, Shak-
speare, Portia and Neville, the last-named
being a wolfram producer. Portion of the
Garrumbah leases, .16 miles to the south-
east, will also be taken in, as there is a
£20,000 reduction plant there, and this can
be placed in working order for £4OO, accord-
ing to a report by Atkinson, of Vegetable
Creek. Crushing should start six weeks after
occupation. To September, 1919, when work
was discontinued, 72,600 tons yielded 4086
tons tin concentrates and 563 tons hand-
picked wolfram and stream tin. The pro-
duct fetched a £63 ss. average; the same
stuff would be worth about £l5O now. The
field is 108 miles from Cairns, and the
Chillagoe railway intersects it. C. H.
Wray, for 15 years a Bewick-Moreing
engineer, and geologists H. I. Jensen and
Saint Smith have given the project their
blessing. Jensen describes large faces of
ore from 3 p.c. to 7 p.c., and agrees with
Saint Smith that “the leases are extensive
and rich enough to keep a township going
for several years.”

Any strike of mineral in the Cloncurry
district (Q.) is apt to start a rush. Con-
sequently a small scamper to the Fullarton
River, near Mackinlay, followed a report of
payable gold. Prospects are poor, and most
of the inspectors have returned. Buck reefs
in slate and quartzite are not attractive.
Some' of the smaller veins carry a little
mineral, and average about lOdwt. gold. To
be attractive in this isolated spot values
would want to be over a couple of ounces.
* * * *
The Commonwealth Mica Co. has taken
up four leases covering big mica outcrops
near Mt. Isa (Q.). Shallow prospecting
work is in progress, and results are reported
to be promising. The sheets are of com-
mercial size; color and texture may improve
below the zone of weathering.
* * * *
Mountain King, on the Oaks field (Q.),
is holding its head up again. Two different
veins have given good results. In one case
100 ft. length of loz. stone 2ft. wide has
been exposed, and in the other a lode Bft.
wide averages lOdwt. in the last cut. These
are good values for the Oaks, which has
worked low-grade ore more successfully than
any other field in thq State.
* * * *
Devon (W.A.) has had another reverse.
Six months ago a new manager prophesied
success —said he thought the mine should
have been a div.-payer for years. On the
strength of this the Board raised sufficient
cash from the sale of reserve shares to re-
sume operations. The Bulletin said at
the time that the co. had. nothing to build
hopes on, and now the chairman, in a circu-
lar to shareholders, says that progress during
the past six months has been unsatisfactory
and results disappointing. The manager has
resigned.
* * * *
Meekatharra and places beyond have had
a monopoly of recent gold finds in the West.
Not long ago some rich dabs were unearthed
at Mistletoe; then someone reported ounce
prospects near Mundiwindi, on the telegraph
line to Marble Bar; now someone else has
applied for a reward claim near Pinyerinya
Pool, on the rabbit-proof fence. As usual the
surrounding country has been pegged and
option-sellers are busy boosting.
* * * *
In Perth the other day chairman Gurney
told a roll-up of Brilliant shareholders that
from now on the ore treated would yield a
profit of £2 a ton, that the co. had sur-
mounted all its difficulties and that no fur-
ther calls would be necessary. The market,
however, doesn’t share this optimism. Gur-
ney mentioned that the directors hold 40 p.c.
of the co.’s shares; but as members of Adel-
aide gold-mining boards frequently take up
forfeited scrip, there is nothing unusual in
this.
*** * *
Great Boulder (W.A.) is looking for a
turn-up in its north-cast corner. Years ago
horizontal bores were put fan-shape into
Boulder ground from various levels of the
adjoining Perseverance mine, and some
passed through payable sections of an ore
body which the Boulder is now trying to
locate. With its fast-diminishing reserves,
Boulder badly needs another source of
ore supply, and the management is hopeful
that such will be found in the locality men-
tioned.
* * * *
The Westralian Labor Government has
some cause for complaint against the Bull-
finch Co. It gave the co. a £4OOO £-for-£
subsidy to enable it to re-open the old Sand
Queen-Gladsome goldmines at Comet Yale;
then, on the repeated assurance that there
wouldn’t be any difficulty in getting London
capital to work the properties if values were
satisfactory, it advanced a further £3OOO.
Well, the workings were unwatered and a
525. 4d. shoot 360 ft. in length and 51in. in
width was exposed. This looked good enough
for anyone to go on with, but the co. sud-
denly gave up and went into liquidation. Had
the co. not led the Government to believe
that if values were payable capital would be
found to work the mines, the subsidies would
never have been granted. The co.’s decision
to cease operations and wind up is said to
have been influenced by an expert’s report
that £50,000 would be required for plant and
development; it probably reckoned the rais-
ing of that sum was out of the question.
* * * *
The silence of a cemetery pervades Luck-
now (N.S.W.), except for the usual optimis-
tic bulletins from South and Pups. The
trumpeting by a share-selling group operating
among the shafts of the old field has
been suspended, and the net result is
an inordinate supply of unmarketable paper.
The age of miracles seems to have de-
parted, and with it the chance of extracting
tons of gold from abandoned claims by the
process of printing scrip forms. The Pups
now think their joint drive development is
a leader from something ahead, and “any-
thing may happen.” A good seepage in the
face of the drive is regarded as a very hope-
ful sign.
* # * *
The directors of New White Crystal, Ard-
lethan (N.S.W.), have realised the folly of
attempting to collect a shilling call on a
three-halfpenny stock; the _ billet-doux has
been cancelled, and a meeting will be held
to consider the matter further. Still, no-
thing but a handsome contribution by share-
holders will save the situation.

W. T. Law re Tongkah Compound dredge:
“A Man on the Spot,” writing to the “Wild Cat”
(B. 8/10/’25) about the failure of the suction-cutter
dredge, said that “the team operating the dredge
was inexperienced and nobody with a knowledge of
hydrostatics was kept on the job.” As my son
was in charge of the dredge during the period,
I should like to throw some light on the facts
of the case. (1) The team was more experienced
for this class of work than any other crew in the
East. They were all certificated, experienced and com-
petent engineers. During manufacture, erection and
the nine months ending May 13, 1925, 1 was in
charge of dredging operations. My experience as
dredge master and engineer extends over 33 years,
and embraces many types of bucket and suction
dredges. I have maintained in running order five
dredges and plant over a period of 8i years in
Siam. (2) A person with a knowledge of hydro-
statics is not required. What is required on a
suction dredge is a sound knowledge of hydraulics,
which the men on the job had. (3) The failure
of the dredge can only be attributed to mechanical
defects and faulty design. I have every confidence
in the machine’s ability to recover tin, and my
reason for leaving was the inability of the makers
to support the crew by supplying the necessary
replacement parts and making the obviously neces-
sary alterations. In spite of all adverse criticism,
I am still confident that suction-cutter dredges can
be made a success. (4) Heavy losses of tin were
proved in the stone chutes, etc., and reported. In
spite of my recommendation no satisfactory altera-
tions were made. (5) In the only month the
dredge stood up reasonably to the work our recoveries
exceeded the bore values of the ground, in spite
of the known losses already mentioned. (6) Re-
garding the boiler trouble, during this month my
son spent three weeks in hospital, with malaria.
Thompson and Co. put a technical man in charge
and it was then the boiler was choked with muddy
feed water. At the same time the firm had an
expert on the job. After the trouble was discovered
by Mr. Thompson, the technical man and the cutter
expert left the job. Incidentally, my son’s salary
was raised.

Kuala Lumpur (F.M.S.) will raise its
register to 200,400 by issue of 33,400
reserve shares in the ratio of one in five. The
allotment will not be effective till January
31, after which date the co. will have a re-
serve of 49,800 shares. The new capital will
be assisted by surplus profits to pay for a
new bucket dredge capable of digging much
deeper ground than the present plant, which
was bought from the Trong Co. in 1918,
erected at Kalumpang, and thence trans-
ferred to Kuala Lumpur in 1923. When the
new plant is ready the old one will be kept
on the shallower ground.
• * * *
Tongkah Harbor (Siam) announces that
its register will be raised to 200,000 _by an
issue of one in three to the existing 150,000.
The 50,000 new shares will be at a ss. pre-
mium—los. payable on December 12 and
15s. on March 31. This accounts for the
speedy rise in share values to 325. after the
slump to 255. three months ago. The veteran
co. could do with something new in the
dredge line, and further areas are likely
enough with tin advancing towards £3OO.
* * * *
Meekatharra and Kalgoorlie (W.A.) have
begun to argue over the proposed Wiluna
railway. Advocates of the Meekatharra
route declare that there is nothing Kalgoor-
lie can supply Wiluna with that can’t be
got cheaper by the shorter route to Gerald-
ton. Kalgoorlie asserts that if the line is
laid from Leonora it will pass through several
belts of auriferous country, and enable visi-
tors from the East to detrain at Kalgoorlie
and proceed to Wiluna from there. It is a
fight to a finish, with odds on Meekatharra.

“Arcadia”: There is one lady visiting Syd-
ney who is in some doubt as to whether it
is safe to use a lorgnette in this outrageous
land. She was seated in one of the city s
fashionable restaurants the other day when
a gentleman attracted her attention, prob-
ably because he was tall, sun-browned and
typical. He was by himself and was iust

one of them.”
arising from a table when she turned the
glasses on to him. He noticed her gaze and.
strolling across, held out his hand. “You will
pardon me, Madam, I am sure,’ he said.
And before she quite realised what had
happened he had politely seized and she
had surrendered the lorgnettes. He toyed
with them curiously for a moment, looked
through them and announced: “Excuse me.
Madam, but Australians are not microbes.”
Then, putting the things into his pocket, he
walked out. Her table was near the door
and his action was so courteous, so unobtru-
sive, that he was out of sight before anyone
quite realised that something ought to be
done about it. The lady has seen neither
the glasses nor the gentleman since. Prob-
ably by this time there is a man somewhere
out from Tibooburra entertaining his mate
by looking for sheep through a lorgnette.

“John Quill” : Pursuing irritation tactics
the M.L. Seamen’s Union recently instructed
firemen on coastal boats not to attend to
any valves on ships, as this work was outside
their duty. The only people affected were
the hardworking engineers, who had to take
over the fiddling work. One wily McAndrew,
informed of the union’s commands, said little,
but when the shift went off duty followed
them on deck. As was the custom, they
started to draw hot water from a tap to wash
themselves ; but McAndrew intervened, Point-
ing out that he was the only one who could
touch that valve. The men then retired to
the galley to get hot water for tea, but the
hoarse voice of the Scot still followed them.
“The cook is in charge of this valve, he
said. “You can’t touch it.” Then they gave
in.
*■* * *
“Lance Jack” : I, too, have known a man
to be married while in the custody of the
law (B. 10/9/’25). It was at Claremont
Camp in 1917. The bridegroom—a regular
A.W.L. man at sailing time —was m clink
awaiting the departure of the reinforcement
to which he was allotted. The lady agreeing
to marry him and no objection being raised
by the C.C., the padre performed the cere-
mony in the guard tent in the presence ot
the orderly-officer and the sergeant of the
guard. The happy pair were given the rest
of the day and evening to honeymoon in the
tent.

“Nikko” : The best definition of drunken-
ness (B. 15/9/’25) I’ve heard was given
by a small boy who was an important wit-
ness in a case at Auckland (M.L.). The
judge was evidently doubtful whether the
witness knew an inebriate when he saw one,
and inquired his reasons for placing the
prisoner in the category. “Please, sir,” said
the youth, “when I seen he didn t know
which foot to put down next, I knew he was
drunk.” That settled it.

“Trevdee”: “Sleep! By gosh, he can
sleep!” said Dad, referring to the pommy
hand. “Why, on’y last night lie was snoring
fit ter bust ’isself, with ’is mouth wide open
like a mine-shaft. It got on me nerves at
last, and I shoved a scone into his mouth.
Wake him? Er course it didn’t wake him; it
made him sleep all the harder. It stopped
the snorin’ a lot, though. W ell, about 2 a.m.
the flamin’ row started agen, and I went into
his room—and, what do you think? The
bloomin’ mice had pinched the scone out of
his mouth !”

“Cinquantene” : My versatile Australian (B.
15/10/’2o) passed out quite recently. lie be-
gan as a blacksmith’s boy, and forsook that
calling to shovel gravel in a pit. Next lie
was apprenticed on a windjammer and took
his ticket. The next five years were spent in
learning carpentering, after which lie matri-
culated at Melbourne University, became a
civil servant (clerical branch), was a school
teacher in W.A. and a lighthouse keeper in
Victoria. Then the sea called again, and he
devoted himself to fishing in Port Stephens
(N.S.W.), building a fine craft• of Ins own.
lie enlisted at 49, and served three
years in the infantry in France. Returning
to his boat after the war, lie was wrecked
at Port Phillip Heads, and finally wrecked
and drowned at Glippsland Lakes. Although
he never saw the sea till lie was 12, he
bore the reputation of being one of the most
efficient and fearless boatmen on the coast,
and he was the prime mover and director ot
the now flourishing Fishermen’s Co-operative
Association. His sons, both holding Lnivcr-
sity certificates, have forsaken schoolteaching
and the public service, and in the slack time
from fishing report for the press or spread
gravel on the roads; each was wounded m
France.

“M.H.H.”: Optimism is by no means a
monopoly of youth. Half a dozen miles south
of Nowra (N.S.W.) I caught up with an
old fellow tramping sturdily along with a
full-sized swag on his back. He mentioned
that he was a Norwegian, 76 years of age.
He had applied for the old-age pension, but
it was refused on the grounds that lie
had been in this country only 20 years in-
stead of the stipulated 25. Nothing daunted,
he was tramping down the coast to Mel-
bourne to put his case before his country s
consul there. I don’t know if he will get
his pension, but I'll swear he deserves it.
“Woorook”: There was one Melbourne man
who would probably have been quite eager to
adopt these fantastic Oxford bags had they
been available in his day. It happened when
trousers had shrunk to the opposite extreme
and were almost skin-tight, the occasion being
a very swagger dance in the Town Hall. \\ ith
his wife lie arrived in a hansom, and when
stepping from it he heard the most ominous
sound known to the ear Ol man, a lipping
somewhere aft. The rear seam of his over-
tight pants had parted. It was no mere
stitch or two. The separation was emphatic.
He was important to the function and his
absence would be noticed, so, after con-
sultation with his wife and the dame m
attendance on the lady’s cloak-room, it was
arranged that as soon as the first dance
had commenced he should retire into the
cloakroom with liis w T ife, remove, the de-
moralised garments, and let her stitch them
up with a needle borrowed from the attend-
ant, who meanwhile was to keep guard out-
side the door. That plan was all right m
theory, but after a while there was a com-
motion outside the door, and female voices
were remonstrating: “But we must get in.
The lady’s fainted. We must get in.” There
was a sound of scuffling. The man, stand-
ing with dress coat and shirt tails, the
tightness of his trousers having caused him
to dispense with underpants, felt that he was
hardly dignified. He looked aghast. So
did his wife. But noticing another door she

dashed to it, unlocked it, and pushing him
hurriedly through relocked it. Then she
heaved a large sigh. But the next instant
there was a frenzied hammering on the door
and the anguished voice of her husband was
heard calling: ‘’Let me through. Let me
through! I’m in the ballroom.”

of the W.A. goldfields were often distinctive
if rarely very original. Sometimes they were
puzzling. An old Kimberley diamond digger
took up a lease on the Murchison and opti-
mistically christened it the De Beers. Pre-
sently lie abandoned it and a new-comer came
along who recognised the second word, but
couldn’t make head or tail of the first. So
he re-registered the show as the Two Beers
—to make sense of it, he said.. Occasionally
there was a gleam of poetry in the nomen-
clature. An old prospector who had spent
half a lifetime at the game without much
luck happened at last on something that
looked reasonably rich, and labelled it the
After Many Years. To peg on to a prospec-
NOT A SOUND WAS HEARD.
DAD: “That young man brought you home
very late last night, Matilda.”
MATILDA : “Yes; I’m sorry if the noise dis-
turbed you, Dad.”
DAD: “It wasn't the noise—it was the
silence.”
tor's claim, or anything that a little reflected
advantage might accrue from, and call your
lease the So-and-So Extended was a common
practice. But in one case where this might
have happened the parent or mother claim
happened to be the New Woman, and public
opinion at Dead Horse ruled against the
addendum. At the Bullfinch boom of 1910
there was a tremendous run on bird names
for the hundreds of saltbush leases that were
pegged out for miles in every direction;
everything that had the remotest affinity with
the finch tribe was levied on very early in
the piece. After that enterprising sponsors
were reduced to ringing the changes on the
“Bull” —Bullant, Bulldog, Bullfrog and so
on. When the Gold Leak Commission was
sitting at Kalgoorlie in 1906, perhaps the
best name of all cropped up. A witness,
questioned as to where lie had obtained some
of the precious metal, solemnly assured the
Commissioner that it came from a little claim
of his own, the Hard to Find!

“X.D.”: Exactly 200 motor-cars were
reported stolen in Melbourne during the
past nine months; and all but eight of the
missing vehicles were recovered, although 60
were burnt, stripped or smashed before the
police located them —some of the specimens
in the yard at Russell-street are mere masses
of scrap. Only 21 cars were captured in the
possession of the thieves ; 92 were recovered
abandoned but intact —motor-car piracy is
mostly freakish adventure. In 19 instances
it was discovered that the cars had not really
been stolen—merely borrowed by persons
who reckoned themselves on sufficiently
friendly terms with, the owner to take such
a liberty. Sometimes it is the owner's
absent-mindedness that is responsible for
the trouble. An ardent supporter of Bruce
motored to Dandenong to hear the policy
speech, and, getting involved in argument
with some friends he met there, went back
with them by train. Arrived home the
absence of his car worried him; and the
police had located it at Dandenong before it
flashed on his mind that he had driven it
there.

VENUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A brilliant feature of the western sky during this
month is the planet Venus, now the
earth and showing at its brightest.”
I was puzzled, I own, in a fashion.
When I woke as it seemed from a trance
With a heart full of amorous passion
And a head that was packed with romance.
At first I opined ’twas the season,
The spring in its glorious birth;
Now I know a more probable reason—
It’s Venus approaching the earth.
It’s excellent weather for courting—
That’s fully and freely allowed.
Young couples are gaily disporting
Away from the maddening crowd.
The dullest of lovers may whisper
Soft nothings for all he is worth;
Be sure they sound sweeter and crisper
Now Venus approaches the earth.
She comes, the invincible goddess,
Comes closer, from out the beyond.
What being in blouse or in bodice
But isn’t impelled to respond?
There are times for rejoicing or rueing,
For serious thoughts or for mirth,
But it must be the season for wooing
When Venus approaches the earth.

CLERICAL PREFERMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Christian Young Lady, refined, sincere earnest
church worker, wishes friendship Christian gentle-
man, high ideals, engaged church work; minister
pref. ; view above.” —Aiious.
0 curate with the collar back-to-fronted,
’Tis not so many years ago, my lad,
With slippers and with mufflers you were hunted
To show you where a helpmate might be had.
Ah me! Is maiden delicacy shunted
That they approach you with a view mat. ad.?
A mating call —and, for the closing word,
The shy assurance “Minister Preferred!”
Here is no jilt, with heart all scorched and furnaced
In flames of passions that have glowed and died.
In Sunday-schools she teaches, staid and earnest,
And decorates the church, I’ll bet, beside.
And when from lone felicity thou turnest
Could any parson crave a fitter bride
Than one who spurns the unregenerate herd
For Christian gents., with “Minister Preferred”?
She might permit a reader (lay) to assist her
Blow from Love’s loving cup the festive froth ;
But you are It for certain, reverend Mister,
You are the star, that is—and she the moth.
I picture her a serious, sweet-faced sister,
Trained from her girlhood to adore the cloth.
She will not have her choice obscured or blurred,
Proclaiming boldly “Minister Preferred.”
Time was when khaki, breathing o’ fights Homeric,
Bested in maidens’ eyes the sombre black.
To outlooks less heroic and hysteric,
Calmer, more balanced views we’re drifting back.
Wherefore, unknown but enviable cleric,
See that a soul-mate she no longer lack,
Assuredly she limited, old bird,
Eligibles with “Minister Preferred.”

“Clerk”: In the Footscray (Vic.) Court
the other day an elderly man was charged
with having travelled in a first-class com-
partment on a second-class ticket. He had
resided in North Melbourne for 55 years,
lie told the Bench, but assured it that this
was the. first time he had ever ridden in a
train; and so unfamiliar was he with the
business that he had got into the compart-
ment without looking to see whether it was
first- or second-class. An incredulous beak
made it half a note, with seven and six costs.

“Windsor”: A well-known Vie. railway
guard got the fright of his life recently when
travelling in the van of a Gippsland train.
While casually sorting parcels his attention
was attracted by the appearance of a large
snake, which pushed its way with an inquir-
ing expression out of a split in the side of
a box in the luggage van. The guard, With
some natural diffidence, retreated to the far
side of the van, whence lie beheld with growing
dismay a second snake following the first.
Taking his courage and a hastily eaught-up
pole in both hands, he clumsily struck at
the first snake, and had the amazing luck
EXCLUSIVELY HIS DOMAIN.
JACK: “Wonderful woman, Mrs. Ironside —she can take her hus-
band’s place in any sphere."
JILL: “Urn — I'm afraid yon don’t know Mr. Ironside as well as

to kill it. Meanwhile the damaged box had
yielded a third and a fourth, and the guard,
now thoroughly rattled, sprang out on
to the footboard of the van, slammed
the door behind him and clung there
until the train reached the next station.
The owner of the box, a snake-charmer,
was then summoned and, to the accom-
paniment of some pardonable profanity,
directed to remove his property. His
petulant comment when he discovered the
dead snake filled the guard's cup of bitter-
ness to the brim. “Blast it, man !’’ he snap-
ped, “you’ve gone and killed the best blanker
I had !”

“Schnorrer”: An estimate of the number
of Jews in the world made by a German-
Jewisli statistical authority, Jacob Lest-
chinsky, puts the total at slightly less than
15 millions. U.S.A. holds 3,600,000 of them;

“Didn't I tell you I was sick of ham an' eggs for breakfast!”
“This isn't ham and eggs, dear — it's just ham!”
Poland is next with 2,829,450, and European
Russia comes third with 2,026,667. Curi-
ously enough, the countries which have given
the Chosen' the most generous treatment and
the widest rights of citizenship have the
lowest percentage in the population. In Aus-
tralia the proportion is but 1 in 1000; in
Britain 4 in 1000; in Belgium 7, and in
Danzig Free City, which -welcomes Jews (it
even offered concessions for the Zionists to
make the place their headquarters) the same as
in Australia. Per contra, in anti-Semite Lith-
uania there are 76 per 1000. The earth-
spot with the largest proportion is Tangier,
24 per cent. Palestine had 11 per cent, in
1022, and must have 15 per cent, by now.
“Sixenate” : To the instances quoted some
time ago of how luck in a sweep has caused
damage to previously hardworking people, a
Melbourne maintenance suit has added an-
other. The wife,
who sued a man
for leaving her and
four children to
starve, said there
was nothing to
complain of regard-
ing her husband
until he drew £4OO
as his share of a
sweep prize; after
that he found work
an interference with
his pleasures, and
finally, when his
money had gone,
cleared out. But
it is not always the
man who strays. A
husband in another
case said that after
his wife had won
£lOO “there was no
holding her,” and
when it had faded
she made such a
bad hand at living-
on the money he
could earn that he
left her to get
away from the debt
and difficulty she
piled upon him. He
said he was pre-
pared to make her
an allowance rather
than go back to
live with her, and
the Court made an
order and some re-
marks to the
woman whom a small stroke of fortune had
so unbalanced.

“Solomon Malaprop” : The cablegrammer’s
latest romance (he has one about once a
quarter) concerns an expedition which is
going to the Cocos Islands to look for a life-
size statue of the Virgin in pure gold, and
for other plunder to the value of £14.000,000,
carelessly abandoned by some pirate “over
a century ago.” The date is rather recent
for piracy on the grand scale. This stupen-
dous hoard is believed to be_ hidden in the
thick jungle covering the interior.’ Ihe
Cocos group consists of about 20 small coral
islands, occupied by 800 colored folk who
grow copra; also by rats, pigs, crabs, a cable
station and the remains of the Emden. Con-
sequently there isn’t much perceptible in-
terior. The expedition is to consist of eight
picked men. though what they are picked
for doesn’t appear, and it is to combine
scientific research with the hunt for the
golden Virgin. There have, it is said, been
many previous search parties, commanded
by admirals, earls and others, including one
(an earl’s) which was wrecked by a land-
slide. The slide apparently blew up, for a
disastrous explosion is also mentioned. The
cable’s effort before this one concerned a
brutal Mexican general who compelled an
empress, quite contrary to historical records,
to look on at the execution of her husband
58 years ago. The coarse soldier's grand-
daughter had gone to Europe at her own
cost, to offer the blood of her polluted race
to the empress for transfusion purposes, and
in doing so to call up happy recollections of
the past. Why the cable has these merry
outbreaks is not known. It isn’t drink, and
this isn’t full moon.
“Chhota Peg”: When ,T. G. Latham was
making his opening address to his constitu-
ents in the Hawthorn Town Hall he was
constantly interrupted by a loud-voiced en-
thusiast somewhere outside. After strug-
gling vainly for some time to make
himself heard, he eventually asked that the
rival orator be silenced. So the police had to
remove a drunk from the Hawthorn lock-up
to that at Kew. That is one of the disadvan-
tages of having the police station in the
Town Hall building.
“Herodot”: Perhaps the most novel re-
quest ever made by a condemned criminal
was that of a man executed in the old Dar-
linghurst (Sydney) Prison. When informed
some days before the ceremony that any
favor in reason would be granted, he an-
nounced, after consideration, that he would
like to be hanged in a dress-suit. He ex-
plained that he did not possess one of his
own, but cheerfully suggested that the attire
could be hired for the occasion for a small
sum. Officialdom having regretted its in-
ability to gratify this particular caprice, the
condemned man asked to be permitted to
wear his best suit of ordinary clothes.
There was no objection to this, and a few
mornings later lie faced the finishing School-
master dolled up to the limits of his ward-
robe.
* * * *
“Pink Tape”: The practice of marrying
for alimony seems to have been elevated to
a fine art by a family recently projected into
the limelight of a Melbourne court. A
bride of a few months’ standing proceeded
against her husband for maintenance; the
defendant undertook to make a home for
her if she would forsake the maternal roof
where, according to him. they had spent a
honeymoon with very little honey in it. He
further explained that the relations gathered
in that house made existence “altogether too
hot” ; they were ma, long divorced from pa
and in receipt of alimony, and his wife's
three married sisters, all similarly detached
from their lords after very brief matrimonial
experiences and also drawing maintenance.
The combined alimony made quite a respect-
able household income. The husband’s sug-
gestion, that the family regarded Man as a
mere alimony-provider, and had made a busi-
ness of marrying him merely in that capa-
city, struck the Bench as so reasonable that
it refused to make an order lest it should
be giving further encouragement to a bad
habit.
“Harold Hardupp” : The wanderlust is in
the blood of young Bernard McCartin, of
Malvern, Melbourne, a 13-year-old youngster
who gave his escort the slip while
being returned home after a second
attempt to get away on a trip round
the world. The American Fleet’s visit
started the fever in him, and after some
minor escapades he stowed himself away
under one of the carriages of the Sydney-
bound express with the intention of trying
to get to America. Caught at Albury he
was sent back to his parents, who locked up
his clothes and had him watched. He was
soon missing again, however, and this time
he got as far as Adelaide, where the Law
apprehended him, covered chiefly with the
dust he had gathered during another journey
under a train. His personal possessions
consisted mostly of a map of the world, witli
the route of his proposed itinerary marked
upon it. The boy is a bright youngster, well
up in his school, and, strange to say, with
no strong fancy for the “pitchers.”
“Anaf”: Among the professional equip-
ment of criminals seized at one time or an-
other by the Sydney police perhaps the most
startling contrivance is a coat, obviously
intended for protective purposes. Made of
a light canvas material, it had safety-razor
blades attached to its sleeves, back and
front, in such a way that anybody who
caught hold of the wearer would receive
dreadful lacerations to the hands. The coat
was discovered with some other criminal
apparatus, and although the ownership of
it was never definitely proved, suspicion
rested on a foreigner who is now serving a
long sentence for a series of offences, and
who probably brought the bright idea from
one of the Southern European countries.
“Wingella”: It happened when 1 was
spending a short holiday in China, and had
set out alone for a ’rickshaw ride. My
horse was a surly fellow, who met all my de-
mands for carefulness with a grumpy “Mas-
kee!" which may be translated as “Don't
care!” Finally Ah Sin got beautifully mixed
up with a motor-car, a prancing trotter
driven by a Parsec and an electric tram.
For three hectic seconds I wondered which
vehicle would be the one to set me knocking
at the gate of St. Peter, and when we did
get untangled I was in a frenzy of rage, for
the ’rickshaw-driver was solely responsible
for the mix-up. Grabbing his pigtail (he
wore one in those days), I yanked his head
nearly off his shoulders and shrieked fiercely
in his ear, “Fhir a’ bhata na lioro eile. Mo
shoraidh slan leat's gaeh ait’ an teid thu !”
Which may be roughly interpreted, “Row
boatman, quickly, they wait on the shore to
welcome your return.” It acted like magic.
No one had ever talked Gaelic to that 'rick-
shaw-driver before. He was so cowed that
he accepted his legal fare at the end of the
journey with only a very feeble request for
more instead of the usual truculent demand.
THE DEAR THING.
WIFE: “Beautiful, isn't it? Father always
makes expensive presents.”
HUBRY : “So I discovered when he gave you
away.”
“Coppertop” : The idea of orcliardists giv-
ing the fruit from a special tree to a hospital
(B. 8/10/25) is not new in the Ormiston
district, near Brisbane. Two families there
have kept up a similar practice for the past
15 years. With the first family it is a row
of pineapples whose fruit is handed over.
The other has a poultry farm, and the
egg proceeds from one good-sized pen are
given to the same institution.
CRUMBS AND THRUMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A missionary in Sydney recently, after com-
plaining that his society would starve if it had to
depend on the crumbs that fall from the rich mans
table declared that ‘some wealthy citizens will spend
thousands on a racehorse yet grudge a tew pence to
a mission effort.’ ”
The breeder of horses will lavish his wealth
To pamper a promising neddy.
And vets, in a conclave will study its health
With bottles and bandages ready.
An army of lackeys attends on the steed,
And scurries with currycombs daily.
And if it would add to a racehorse’s speed
They’d feed him on fivers quite gaily.
The manger would even be moulded from gold
If that would add pace or endurance.
And if such a thing would protect it from cold
They’d cover the beast with insurance.
They carpet a paddock with grasses for him
To scamper upon at his pleasure.
And, having discovered, they humor each whim
Of this great equestrian treasure.
The owner pays oodles of wages to men
Who toil at the shrine of the gee-gee.
Hut what does he care for the mission-folk when
They sizzle in steaming far Fiji ?
Yes, what does he give to those missions in need?
Not even a cuss continental.
For he is too busy attending the speed
Of gallopers temperamental.
So this becomes evident, talking of crumbs,
And somewhat to vary the fable:
No mission should hope to subsist on the thrums
That fall from the rich fellow’s stable.

The Inst offices have been performed for
Tom Carlyon, whose name lias been given to
pubs in several places in Victoria. Tom,
originally a Murray River boat-skipper,
graduated from landlord of a 30s. per week
hostelry to the best-known caravanserai in
St. Ivilda, which
he sold a couple
of years ago. The
highest tribute to
his business capa-
city is that the
na m e “Carlyon”
has been left up
wherever lie posted
it on a pub. He
was a great sculler
in his day—which
is to say, about 30
years ago.

The decision of Queensland Premier Gil-
lies to get out while the going was good was
not altogether a surprise. It was known
that he was breaking down under the worries
of office and wms looking out for a softer
job, but it was thought that he would hold
on in the hope of getting the Governorship.
Throughout his brief career as Premier he
has been faced by a hostile section of his
own crowd, who chuckled every time he got
himself into a mess and did nothing to help
him out. Now his enemies will have to go
through the same ordeal, while Gillies re-
stores his shattered nerves with a rest-cure
at the public expense.
With the retirement of Gillies, Bill Mc-
Cormack achieves his ambition to become
Premier of Queensland. He has the power-
ful backing of the A.W.U., of which
he was formerly Queensland general secre-
tary, but he is not personally popular, and
it is complained that he is the least acces-
sible of all the Labor Ministers. He has
been in Parliament since 1912, was Speaker
for four years, and has been a Minister for
the last six, so he, too, has done well out of
politics.
John Mullan, the Attorney-General of
Queensland, who just missed the semi-judi-
cial job which Premier Gillies pulled off,
holds probably a world’s record; though a
layman, he has been Attorney-General of his
State for five years.
Peter Allen, the humorous and genial mem-
ber for Yorke Peninsula (S.A.), better
known as the Register's “Greens’ Plains
correspondent,” passed out with tragic sud-
denness last week, aged 70. Ten minutes
after speaking on the Motor Vehicles Bill he
fell while descending Parliament House
steps and expired. He had been Liberal
party Whip for many years, and was one
of the three sitting members with the longest
period of Parliamentary service.
A long-distance judicial pensioner, Hart-
ley Williams, recently celebrated his 83rd
birthday in England, where he has been
drawing a pension ever since his retirement
from the Vic. Bench in 1893. He was the
son of Edward Eyre Williams, one of the
earliest barristers
in Melbourne, and
a Judge for 20
years. And he
would have been a
Judge for much
longer than that if
the Government of
the day had made
him instead of
John Madden Chief
Justice. But the
rule against “pro-
moting” a puisne
Judge had not been
then so well trod-
den underfoot as it
has been since.

Few depositors ever heard of just-dead
John Alsop, but he did for the savings banks
of Australia what Otto did for the automo-
bile —invented the engine that drives the
machine. Actuary and manager of the Mel-
bourne Savings Bank in the era when it
was managed by trustees, Alsop laid the
foundations of the vast Vic.. State Savings
Bank system by introducing a campaign of
continuous advertising. Until he started
thrift had been furtive, and the secret saving
of shillings was not esteemed a virtue. Alsop
distributed millions of leaflets by messengers
from house to house. Next he established
suburban with the Col-
lingwood office. He left no excuse to the un-
thrifty, for there is now a savings bank close
to every picture-theatre in Melbourne.
Forgan Smith, who defeated Alf Jones
for the Deputy-Premiership of Queensland,
is a pushful young Scot, who left his native
heather only a few years ago. A painter by
trade and a politician by inclination, he has
done very well for himself in Parliament,
having held office for the. greater part of his
time as Chairman of Committees and
Deputy-Speaker. Minister for Public Works
and State Enterprises, and Minister of Agri-
culture and Stock.
Charlie Over, one of the best cricket
coaches in Victoria, died last week. Among
the multitude to whom he had bowled was
that enthusiastic but poor cricketer Lord
Dudley. During the latter's term as G.-G.
he was a constant visitor at the nets at the
M.C.C. Towards the end of each practice he
would put a half-sovereign on the middle
stump as a reward for the pro. who dis-
lodged it. On his Ex.’s departure from Aus-
tralia, Charlie, who had often bowled him,
remarked: “He’s the best Governor-General
we’ve ever had!” “Garn, what do you know
about Governors, anyway?” someone inter-
jected. “Well, he’s the best Governor-
General I've ever had,” said Charlie.
Ted Morley, Liberal member for Barwon,
was the proudest man in the Vic. Parlia-
ment when Treasurer Peacock announced
that the Compo Cabinet had decided to in-
troduce the Tote Bill this session. He recol-
lected that only three years ago his own
measure to legalise the machine was rejected
by 41 votes to 15, and that six out of the
eight Assembly members of the present Gov-
ernment voted against it. Premier Allan’s
conversion was not nearly so great a sur-
prise as Peacock’s. Morley has made the
tote as much his legislative hobby as Row-
land Hill did penny postage, and he has
now more than a sporting chance of success,
notwithstanding Greenwood, Judkins and co.
Morley had a hand in the big scrimmage
(3914-18), and gained three pips. To him
is duo much of the credit for a long stretch
of the great ocean (coastal) road.
Bananaland lost one of its stalwart R.C.
clerics when Monsignor Denis F'ouhy passed
on the other day. A Cork man, after pre-
liminary Irish studies he was finishing up
at the Irish College in Paris during the war
of 1870 when Bishop O’Quinn, of Brisbane,
made an appeal for recruits. Young Fouhy
responded and was followed by a brother.
For the past 28 years he had been the lead-
ing civic as well as spiritual mover in Too-
woomba, sprinkling that city with charitable
institutions. For these activities Pope Ben-
edict XV. made him a Domestic Prelate. He
was 77 at the end.
Three lawyers contest the Federal elec-
tions in South Aus. —Duncan-Hughes and
A. .T. McLaclilan for the Liberals, and Jack
Daly for Labor. Duncan-Hughes, who comes
of a wealthy clan, has not chased Costs for
many years. He represented. Boothby in
the last Parliament, and now has to hold
the fort against Ivneebone, the late editor
of the now defunct Daily Herald, who has
resigned his seat in the State House.
McLachlan, who comes of a south-eastern
squatting family, has a large legal practice:
he was the late Charley Kingston’s last law-
partner, and from him got the bacillus poli-
ticus. At present he is returning hot-foot
from England, where he was holiday-making
when news of the dissolution reached
him. Daly, the last of the trio, is the son
of a working man, who started as an office
boy in a solicitor’s ante-room. By hard work
he climbed to the position of managing clerk
and finally partner to Attorney-General Bill
Denny. He was unsuccessful at the last
State elections.
“Iford” : The Rev. W. Touched, chairman-
elect of the Congregational Union of N.S.W.
and fervent anti-Romanist, entered the minis-
try, according to the S. M. Herald, in 1900,
at Midland Junction (W.A.). As a matter
of fact he was laboring in the vineyard be-
fore that, but in another section, at the then
hustling goldfields township of Cue, on the
Murchison. A zealous young pastor, he threw
himself vigorously into all local activities and
announced his desire to be known as “Plain
Bill.” And the name stuck as long as he was
on the goldfields.
While recently-dead Reg Murray was Vic.
Government Geologist, he appeared before a
board or select committee to be examined
regarding the value of coal found some dis-
tance from the likely fields. He got a broad
hint that it would save time if he just
answered questions. His replies were laconic,
and those interested who were listening were
beginning to feel safe, when the chairman
put the kybosh on things by asking blandly.
“Is there anything you’d care to add?”
“Yes.” answered Murray, “the stuff won’t
burn.”
As a preliminary to appointing a director
of child-welfare activities, Dr. Argyle, Vic.
Health Minister, is sending Drs. Henrietta
Main and Vera Scantlebury to Maoriland to
study the methods adopted there for reduc-
ing infant mortality. In this he is following
the advice of Truby King, who, after in-
specting baby-health centres in Melbourne,
reported to Argyle that, instead of squab-
bling, the various organisations needed to
get together. One or two residental centres,
enjoying proper supervision of nurses by
a few skilled seniors, would, he urged, en-
sure a higher standard. If Truby King-
had only let himself go, instead of reaching
down the soft words, he might have said
something really interesting about the well-
intentioned squabblers.
Director Frank Tate joined a crowd of Vic.
teachers at their union 'rooms one day last
week to present, on their behalf, a wallet
of notes to veteran George H. Carter, who
has just completed GO years’ active service.
Thirty of these were given, by a man with
full pension rights, to strenuous honorary toil
for a superannuation scheme for the com-
parative youngsters of the service. Now that
the success of the Grand Old Man’s pet idea
is assured, the grateful peds piled their bank-
notes together to speak a little of their
gratitude.
The ex-Ivaiser has warned the warring
white world against the Yellow Peril. It
recalls his famous 1895 cartoon. The Ger-
man Michael, with wings and a flaming
sword, stood on a cliff issuing a dread warn-
ing to seven robust females in heavy armor.
Germania was eager for the fray, France
looked sceptical, and Rritannia had just
stepped off a penny-piece and seemed embar-
rassed. A blazing cross filled the western
sky, and in the East, advancing on a dragon’s
back and enveloped in the smoke from burn-
ing European cities, was a squatting Buddha
• —the humorless Wilhelm selected the
world's most pacific symbol for his invading
terror. The versatile monarch designed the
picture, which was presented to the Czar.
The “blind barrister,” G. A. Maxwell, de-
fender of hundreds of criminals in the courts
of Victoria, spoke the other night at Foots-
cray in support of the Nationalist candidate
for Maribyrnong. Ilis pathetic appearance
as he was led on to the stage made no appeal
to the crowd at the back, which greeted him
with howls. Waiting until the noise had
subsided, lie said: “I cannot help thinking
li o w times have
changed. Thirty-
five years ago I
addressed a politi-
cal meeting in the
Collingwood Town
Hall, and just
prior to that I had
defended one of my
first clients, a man
charged with bur-
glary. He was
acquitted, and on
my appearance at
th e Collingwood
Town Hall, there
in the front row
was my burglar,
who cheered my
every utterance.
Now when I come
to Footscray I find
my late clients in
the back hooting
me.”
MAXWELL, the
blind M.H.R. for
Fawner.
The “American” export, who has just
declared the Mt. Isa field beyond Cloncurry to
be one of the largest deposits of silver-lead
ore in the world, is Australia’s own Tom
McKellar (“Tommy”) Owen, born at Braid-
wood (N.S.W.) and educated at Sydney
Grammar School. Graduating from Sydney
University he went to Broken Hill, where
he developed a new practice for the treat-
ment particularly of slime. A few years
back he went off on the track of silver-lead
and zinc ore in Canada, South America and
the U.S., after which he rapidly became one
of America’s leading experts in metallurgy
and mining engineering.
J. A. Riley has resigned the secretaryship
of S.A. Royal Agricultural Society. He had
held it since 1909, and was an active lieuten-
ant to John Creswell before that. He is see.
also to S.A. Cricket Association and Adel-
aide Oval. Having seen the Agricultural
Society into its new grounds at Wayville.
and declared a profit of nearly £2OOO on
the recent spring show, he retires with the
suggestion that it should be a full-time job
for a younger man.
For the third time in two years .Tames
Hennesey has been transferred from the
Hobart Gaol to the public hospital to have
sundry hardware removed. Just on two
years ago he was removed to the sick bay
with a stomach resembling a pin-cushion.
A few months later lie was back in hospital
again, and this time the sawbones found
several nails, the handle of an enamel panni-
kin, several inches of leather strap with a
brass buckle attached and a small table-
knife. The other day he complained to the
gaol doctor of another pain. His meal on
this occasion was only a needle, a nail, a
rosary and some glass. One of these days
some nasty person will start asking how r he
is able to get these luxuries in gaol, or even
whether gaol is the proper place for him.
From 11. .Towett, of Leicester (Eng.) :
A recent Bulletin social writer, reporting the
wedding of a Miss Florence May Jowett and Cecil
Howard Douglas, of the Eastern Extension, Singapore,
described the bride as a niece of “the great Jowett,
of Oxford.” The late Professor Jowett, Master of
Balliol, had neither nephews nor nieces. The
Professor was the eldest son of Benjamin Jowett
and Isabella Langhorne. There were nine children
in that family. None of them married, and Pro-
fessor Jowett outlived them all. He died in 1893,
aged 77.
Though he will retire from the Vic. Edu-
cation Department in December, C. R. Long.
M.A., editor of the School Paper and the
Education Gazette, does not intend to rust.
By dint of fine enthusiasm and much thank-
less work, last year he caused 37 memorials
to the explorers to be erected along the track
of Hume and Hovell. Now he is beginning
to urge that steps be taken to commemorate
Sturt’s voyage down the Murray in a whale-
boat (1830), Angus McMillan’s discovery
of a road from Omeo to Corner Inlet, and
Count Strzelecki and James Macarthur’s
journey across Gippsland from Mt. Kosciusko
to Western Port in 1840.
THE UNFORGETTABLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My memory's a bursting barn,
An informative library shelf,
Of things that matter not a darn
To anybody but myself.
No real history there will stop,
Most figures take immediate wing;
But ’tis a Johnny Allsorts shop
Of things not worth remembering.
I’ve studied sciences exact,
Like law, and desperately tried
To keep the formula and fact
My cerebellar cells inside.
’Twas vain. And, looking back the years,
The incidents that always spring
Unbidd’n to mind and eyes and ears
Are things not worth remembering.
The precepts pumped into my head
To make me wealthy—-aye, and wise—
Escaped as quick as text-books read,
Flew as the snipe or woodcock flies.
Vet clear on memory’s pages penn’d,
To thrill or chill, to stir or sting,
There shall be with me to the end
The things not worth remembering.
Bitter or sweet, through whirling years,
’Neath suns that scorch or skies that freeze,
Vet ever framed in smiles or tears,
A lifetime’s trivialities.
Scenes known, tones back in boyhood heard,
Phrases and sentences that cling,
The scribbled line, the whispered word—
The things not worth remembering.
I hear a voice: “You gave no heed,
O sinner stained with mire and clog
Of earth, to collect or to Creed,
To catechism or Decalogue.”
’Twill be an ineffective kind
Of plea before the Throne to bring:
“O Lord, the only things to find
Abiding lodgment in my mind
Were those not worth remembering.”

u
FUMO
BRAND—
CALCIUM CYANIDE as a rabbit exterminator admits no
failure; has no rival.
It i’s safe, effective and economical.
Mr. J. K. Little, of Yugilbar, N.S.W., writes, 15th
January, 1925 ;
“Re the result of fumigation by Calcium Cyanide. There
is no question of its killing power. I am convinced that
in this part rabbits could be reduced to
a negligible quantity if everyone would
go at it. I believe this process of de-
struction is easily the best yet, and it is
easier work than other methods, which
counts for a lot also.”
The Fumo Dust Blower has been de-
signed specially for the application of
CALCIUM CYANIDE. It is simple, light
and easily managed.

“H.E.R.”: As far as horned beasts are
concerned, the urge of salt in the mountainous
country in the north-east of Yic. is greater than the
call of spring. 1 had been used to riding after
cattle in the hilly districts of Bananaland, and to
seeing them stampede at first sniff or on sight of a
human being; but picking a way along these razor-
back heights with mounted bushmen, I was astonished
to see cattle, wild and tame, emerge from deep-down
lairs and pockets, and climb almost perpendicular sides,
responding to the peculiar cry of the salt-bringers.
Periodically these men this wild portion of
the State with their salt-present, and there is not a
horned beast that will not turn up to the re-echoing
invitation.
* * * *
“F.1.N.”: Can the timber experts of the
Council tell me if white-gums 18in. through at the
butt are any good for tank-stand poles. On the
Flinders about Richmond and Hughenden (Q.) they
grow as straight as a rule and 40ft. high. I have
used tliem in thatched sheds for laying the rushes
across, and they are now as sound as ever after 10
years’ exposure, but they are quite useless in the
ground. The big timber, however, seems to have
a hard heart, and it might do for more things
than I’ve used it for. But I don’t want to take a
chance.

“Moe”: What is the biggest bonus ever
paid for the scalp of a dingo? Years ago, in the
Bourke (N.S.W.) district, £5O was offered for an
old-man warrigal. In the same part bonuses from
£2O to £3O have been comparatively common.
But the record bonus was handed over in the Roma
district (Q.) about 10 years ago for a dog which in
less than nine months did damage estimated at
some thousands. His scalp was worth £95, made
up of £5O offered by a local graziers’ association,
£25 added by one squatter and £2O by another.
The amount was earned by a kangaroo-shooter, who
spent three weeks on the job. Local legend has it
that the sum was dissipated within a couple of hours.
All hands swam in it while it lasted.
* * * *
“Xamilc” : “Solo” says (B. 17/9/’25) that
Queensland wool runs out fine through the rigors of
a hot climate. That is true, but it also implies
extremes of temperature and other disabilities,
such as lack of shade, long walks to water, etc.,
which assist in causing a wasted fibre with corres-
ponding lack of crimp, character, and consequently
yielding capacity. Hence the frequent introduction of
southern rams to keep up the quality. The best
Australian fine-merino wool comes from New England,
the Southern Table-
lands and Yass districts
in N.S.W. and from
Tasmania. None of
these can be said to
have hot climates.
Queensland wool milk
have altered consider-
ably if the bulk of it
is of seventies count, as
“Solo” asserts. The
greater part of it was
never better than
sixty-fours up to five
years ago. To instance
the power of the
merino to stamp its
characteristics when
assisted by careful
selection and breeding,
one has only to look
at the attractive come-
back wool grown in
some of the colder
southern districts of
N. S. Wales and Vic-
toria. It not only
carries the evenness of
crimp and character of
the merino, but the
broad fibre with its
robust wave has been
eliminated, whilst the
lustre and length of
staple inherited from
its long-wool progen-
itors remain—an illus-
tration of selection of
the best characteristics
of both breeds. It nas
unique spinning quali-
ties, but the fly in the
ointment is the lack
of weight in the fleece
together with the years
that must elapse before
perfection is reached.
It is the crimp which
gives wool its elasticity
and strength; a fibre
will thus stand eon-
siderable strain and
yet resume its original waviness when eased
again. Correspondingly, there is a great difference
in the length when fibre is pulled and the crimps
thereby straightened out.
* * * *
“Canar” : One of the disadvantages attend-
ing travel in the interior mountains of New Guinea
is the difficulty of cooking food or making tea. This,
in the more lofty regions, necessitates having to live
on cold and ill-nourishing viands. It is due to the
fact that water boils at 100 degrees centigrade at
sea-level only, there being a fall in boiling-point for
each decrease in atmospheric pressure. In mountain-
ous country, where the pressure is considerably
reduced, water may boil almost before it has had
time to get hot. The consequence is that food
cannot be easily prepared, and as at such elevations
the system requires a good deal of nourishment,
inconvenience necessarily results. This obstacle has
caused the ultimate failure of more than one exploring
party in high altitudes, and at present there docs
not appear to be any likelihood of its being over-
come.
NO PLEASING SOME PEOPLE.
FOREMAN (to cook of out-baclc working party) : “The fellers arc going off pop—want to
know if yer can’t make the tucker a bit, better.”
COOK: “Better! Spare me days, if I wuz to give the cows curried angels they’d grouse
an’ want archangels.”
“Polycarp”: I am rather surprised to be
called upon to defend the magpie against the English
nightingale as a songster. Every authoritative bird-
man plumps enthusiastically for the maggie, includ-
ing such prominent. English naturalists as John Gould,
A. R. Wallace and George Barker. Add to this list
Frank Tate, J. A. Leach, A. H. Chisholm, W. B.
Alexander, C. L. Barrett and others who have
discussed the subject. Frank Tate wrote: “The
nightingale’s song, as a bird song, I thought dis-
appointing. I remember having the same feeling
with regard to the thrush and blackbird. The charm
of their songs is largely in the associations they
invoke.” They have Shelley, Keats, Wordsworth and
a score of other poets behind them, and ages of
legend ; but I spoke of the actual song. Moreover, the
nightingale has the stage set by his habit of singing
in the dark when everything is quiet. Strip away all
these associations, and the unlauded magpie has far
the sweeter and richer song.
“0.5.”: Hearing that 500 bags in eight
hours was the record for one man loading wheat
or maize, a 62-year-old farmer from Lindenow, South
Gippsland, set out to smash it. In less than that
number of hours he had loaded 1040 bags of maize
into five 16-ton trucks.
* * * *
“The Deacon”: Another entry for the
world’s luckiest man (B. 8/10/’2s>. A drover
camped by the Peel River (N.S.WL) was holding
his night-watch when something alarmed his horse.
The next thing he knew he had gone clean over a
gorge. The branches of a big tree caught and held
him unscathed, but the horse was smashed on the
rocks 60 feet below.
“O. Coral” : Has anyone ever heard of an
alligator using a boat as a bed-sitting-room? Down
at the Mitchell River (N.Q.) some time back a
whaleboat got into difficulties and sank. Later on
the natives discovered that some enterprising croc,
had come along and secured an option on it as a
place of deposit for its eggs, and was fixing it up
as an improved incubator.
* * * *
“Centre”: “Curlew’s” horses at Prairie
(C.Q.) that came in once a week for a drink (B.
24/9/’25) were guzzlers compared with a couple
of Clydesdales I knew. They broke away and went
in search of grass, the paddock they were in being
eaten out. They pushed open a gate and got into
a neighbor's grass paddock five miles away, but were
unable to pull the gate open when they wanted to
get out again. They were there for three weeks
before their owner found them, and even then were
not too tucked up to canter off to the nearest tank.
“Kriz”: Tbe nor’-west coast of Australia
can boast of its tides. Some parts along the coast
have as great a rise and fall as any in the world,
At Walcott Inlet there is a difference of 38ft.,
which is perhaps the largest displacement of water
anywhere along the coast. Next to that comes King
Sound with a rise and fall of 32ft. Further down
the coast Broome has 27ft. Further up north, at
Chilli Head, just outside Lombardina, the variation
is 25ft. Steamers going in to berth on the full tide
are required to stay for 12 hours 'before there is
sufficient water to enable them to leave, the tides
occurring twice in 24 hours.
* * * *
‘■‘Runa”: The name “she-oak” (B.
l/10/’25) is something the florist also stumbles
over occasionally. An Australian who had trans-
ferred to M.L. and wished to have some dinkurn
Aussie trees in his new garden asked the local M.L.
florist to obtain a couple of she-oaks for him. After
a long delay the trees were duly delivered, each
sewn up in its little scrim bag and labelled care-
fully “1 Lady ■ Oak.”
* * * *
“Herodot”: There is no animal cunning
to equal that of the rat. Some time ago an effort
was made to rid an old building in Sydney of the
swarms of rodents in a disused sewer system. Ar.
apparatus for generating chlorine gas was rigged up,
and the nozzle of a long rubber tube was pushed
down through one of the holes by which the rats
came out. The apparatus was worked intermittently,
and for a time produced good results. Then one day
it was found that the gas did not go through, but
remained in the generator. When the tube was
pulled up it was found that the rats had plastered
mud and cement over the nozzle, thus stopping the
gas from issuing. The wet cement had been carried
from a house in course of erection near by.
* * * *
“Larrapinta”: Swarming time will soon
be with us, and here’s a tip for beekeepers. Keep
a good-sized mirror handy, and when a swarm emerges
and flies high, with the intention of settling in the
treetops or leaving for parts unknown, grab your
mirror, run out and get the swarm between you
and the sun. Then flash the focused light on to the
leading bees. This will arrest their flight and
cause them to circle, and by flashing the light just
above them, they can be brought to the ground. A
little practice soon gives the knack, and only those
who have climbed a 100 ft. redgum after a swarm
can realise the work it saves.
* * * »
“Dominie”: The painting of warts and
ringworm with ink is still common out back. And
often I have seen cuts on kiddies, filled with spider-
web and cracked lips covered by dirty newspaper.
Recently I struck a small girl proudly wearing a
penny which had been securely tied over a boil.
The coin was dirty and bore ample traces of
verdigris. On being questioned, she informed me
that “copper drors boils.” The parents who employ
these methods are numerous enough to make the
teaching of hygiene in small schools a somewhat
discouraging job.

THE ROAD TO DORRIGO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The road that leads to Dorrigo
Climbs gamely up the hills,
By steeps where gleaming gum-trees grow
And silver water spills;
By jungles where the wallabies
Peep shyly through the vines;
By gorges filled with spreading trees
And slender-masted pines.
And all the day along the way,
As up the road we go.
Prom bush and spring the gay birds sing
A song of Dorrigo.
It’s up beyond the mountain crest,
So tall and blue and proud,
The pillar and the place of rest
Of every vagrant cloud ;
It’s up beyond the jagged rocks
That bear the forest’s weight,
And mock the puny lightning shocks,
And thunder’s bellowed hate.
And all the time, as up we climb,
The lowlands misty grow,
And bush birds sing by creek and spring
Their song of Dorrigo.
The horses’ sides are flecked with white
Ere half the hill is done,
While yet above from height to height
The laughing sunbeams run.
But up and up they’ll bear us on,
For well enough they know
That neither stars nor sun have shone
On such as Dorrigo.
By billabong they mooch along,
And hoof-beats echoed low
Join birds that sing by creek and spring
In praise of Dorrigo.
WORSE ’N NAWTHIN’.
“Who’s matter this mornin’, Jimmy? Dcdn’ ’ee go bed last night?”
“Went bed all right, Cap’n, but eudden get a wink of sleep. An’ boay
Johnny ’ere ’ad less ’n me.”
rh praise of happy Dorrigo
That nestles on the hills,
Where anything on earth will grow—
Aye, even cheques and bills—-
Of Dorrigo the ever-green
Where men and trees grow tall
And every girl’s a lissom queen
To kings that conquer all.
By forest tall and waterfall,
No wonder as we go
The bush-birds sing by creek and spring
The melodies that ring and ring
In praise of Dorrigo.

“Moe”: A marked phenomenon amongst
the natives of New Guinea and the Bismarck Islands
is the small number of female as compared with male
births. In some parts the ratio is about one to
three or four, and naturally it has set up influences
which are doing more than anything else to bring
about the gradual extinction of the natives. Before
the advent of civilisation the balance between the
two sexes was more equally maintained, and it is
reported that as recently as 25 years ago there were
sufficient young women to preserve the balance in
districts where to-day there is only about one woman
to every three or four men. In areas where the native
lives much as he did before the coming of the white
man there is no perceptible shortage; certainly
not the marked decrease in the birth-rate found else-
where. Perhaps Nature, having decided that a
civilised and an uncivilised race cannot live along-
side each other in harmony, proceeds to put into
effect an influence such as this in order to get rid
of the latter.

“Km”: One of the few birds found no-
where but in the nor’-west of Australia is the red-
plumed ground-pigeon. Its colors are so striking that
they cannot fail to catch the eye. The head with
its long crest is a rich brown, the forehead blue-grey,
the cheeks and throat white and there is a vermilion
patch around the eye. They seem to nest on the
rock outcrops near waterholes between Derby and
Wyndham; the holes nearly always have a number
around them. They make a very pretty sight on the
wing. Efforts have been made by bird-lovers to
keep some of the young as pets, but they all died
despite the utmost care.
* * * *
“Chhota Peg” : When lie takes a liking to
white people with whom he comes in contact the
native, whatever his race, will go to great lengths
to please or even interest them, though on occasions
the result leaves something to be desired. A
white trader and his wife had been residing for some
time in one of the smaller Pacific islands when one
of the local celebrities died, and they were invited
to attend the obsequies. They found the departed
sitting bolt upright in a chair with full war-paint
on, and followed the chanting bearers who carried
him to where a grave had been prepared. As
soon as he had been safely laid away a feast was
announced, and one of the chief mourners announced
that there was something special for “Missy.”
Everyone knew how fond white people were of tea,
and so some had been made for them. The beverage
was not improved by the fact that a whole pound
had been used to make the single brew. But that
was nothing compared with the vessel in which it
was solemnly proffered. The natives had always
heard tea referred to as “a pot of tea” and had
therefore applied for a pot at the store. Unfortu-
nately they did not mention what they wanted it for.

“S.C.”: Barring Eden, about the oldest
towns on the far South Coast of N. S. Wales are
Merimbula and PambuLa—-properly Panboola, as
the abos. called it—both of which had reared their
wooden walls when Bega consisted of a few shanties,
the greater number destined to be swept away by
floods. Pambula was of some consequence when a
tall, thin surgeon—Dr. Erasmus Bligh, grandfather
of the Sydney medico, and a connection of the
irascible Admiral—hung out his sign there in the
THE PLEASURE WAS ALL HIS!
POLICEMAN: “Did you sec this lady knocked down?”
WITNESS: “ Too right! I wouldn't have missed it for a fiver.”
’sixties. Matthew A. Munn, who made maizena,
subsequently migrated thence from Merimbula to
De nearer the corn-flats. The age-blackened wooden
houses look shabby now beside the modern brick
erections, and the glory of both towns has departed,
but they serve to mark the progress of settlement
and the winning by our stalwart forefathers, not
of fortunes, but of modest competencies in the
primeval bush.
“Gouger”: I lay comfortably concealed
among the leafy mangroves on the banks of the
Bloomfield (N.Q.). Out of the bend upstream came
floating what looked like a log. I patted my Win-
chester and prayed for suspicion to become certainty,
for the alligators take heavy toll of horses along
the banks of that beautiful river. Flapping
lazily but powerfully along the brown water a blue

“Yes, dear man, and the hairy caterpillars.”
crane swished past. He leisurely circled above the
log; then volplaning, settled upon it, shipped his
wings, tucked up a leg, and solemnly stared down into
the water. Disgusted, I shifted my gaze, peering
through the branches at the shadow-darkened stream
for a glimpse of an evil black snout. As the tide
floated the log past me. I noted that it bore little
spiked ridges cutting the water just where the crane
rested his toes, while a few feet in front of him could
be discerned four small grey corks in pairs, about
18in. apart. I aimed an inch behind the two rear
corks and fired. 'Whether the alligator or the crane
was the more surprised I don’t know. The ’gator's
head and tail almost met, and a somersaulting crane,
screaming raucously, swished up the river like a
thing in hysterics.
# * * *
“X2X”: I would point out to “Bill R.”
(B. 24/9/’25) that the examples quoted by him
don’t disprove my
statement that electri-
city leaking into the
earth at a given spot
is so soon dispersed
that it can do no harm
to anyone standing
there. The case of
the dam whose water
became charged with
electric current from
some fallen wires is
possible because water
is a good conductor
and the current could
not escape from it, or
could do so only jn
minute quantities. This
is seen on a small
scale in the “fishponds”
so popular at bazaars.
Practically the same
applies to the other
case mentioned, in
which a leakage of
electricity took place
through a wet floor in
a sawmill. Damp or
wet wood •is an ex-
cellent conductor, and
the current would be
confined to the wet
portions of the floor.
In both cases the area
of electrification was
circumscribed. But a
patch of ground is
quite a different mat-
ter. What would actu-
ally happen would te
that the current leak-
ing into it would
promptly go somewhere
else, and none would remain to communicaate a
shock to anybody standing on it.
* * * *
“Ben Zine” : The Australian ’possum does
remarkably well in his adopted M.L. home, and,
owing to the colder climate, clothes himself in a
finer quality of fur than in his native land. Also
the abundant food apparently causes a more rapid
increase. The taking of skins is under license from
the Government, but numerous poachers exist. The
fur coats got in a legal manner are stamped by an
officer of the Government. The official at the Dunedin
centre passed through 55,000 skins for the 1925
season; 21,000 of these came from Otago, 23,000
from the West Coast of the North Island and Nelson.
Prices at recent sales went as high as 19s. 6d. for
extra-choice quality and color.
“Bush Yet.”: Though “Pick” (8.24/9/’25)
may doubt it, I have seen two pure-white horses.
They were white because of the lack of the natural
pigment, melanin, in the skin. Even the eyes were
almost white, the faint pink in them being due to
the blood circulating in the fine vessels of the iris.
One of these albinos presented an interesting and
peculiar clinical stucW. Though devoid of pigmenta-
tion elsewhere, he had a chain of tumors extending
from the butt of the tail down to the sheath. These
tumors were due to an excess of melanin. Such
tumors are fairly common on grey horses.
* * * *
“Ida D.”: The best amateur gardener I
know has been all her life a firm believer in a
queer theory. Pumpkins, melons, beans and peas
she sows before the moon is> full; she says that the
last few days before full are the best. Lettuce,
cabbage, celery and the like, which must not run to
seed, go into the earth when the moon begins to
wane. To prove that there is nothing in this idea
we have often planted seeds from the same packet,
and under precisely similar conditions as to soil,
watering, etc., but contrary as to time, and. it is
remarkable that where we get a dish of peas or
beans she will get bueketsful, while our lettuces,
celery, etc., invariably run to seed. I know that
the idea is scoffed at, but I have heard it approved
in many different countries and by gardeners of
all classes.
t * » *
“Phoney”: Tlic Malays and Kopangers
(indentured crews) on the pearling luggers at Broome
finish their festive evenings with sail, which they
buy at street stalls. Sati is half-cooked meat cut
into inch-square pieces and impaled on a wooden
skewer. An old field.-service pocket-book tells me
it is known in the Indian army as habob. The
feast is taken to the camp to be further grilled
over the fires, and is then eaten with audible relish.
* * * *
“Coot”: The Australian term “trevally,”
with its variations of “trevalli” and “trevalla,” is
a corruption of “cavally” or “cavalli,” by which
name the fish is known in Europe. Captain Cook in
his “Journal” (1769) refers to it thus: “Several
canoes came off to the ship and sold us some fish
—cavallys as they are called —which occasioned my
giving the islands the same name.”
“Coolabali” : A hawk about the size of a
sparrow-hawk, and distinguishable by a rather broad,
light collar, is the cleverest and swiftest hunter I
have seen. Recently a flock of rosellas shot across
at top speed, but they were not swift .enough to
escape the hawk. He rose above them in a sidelong
fashion, struck a rosella to the ground with a
blow of his wing, and dropped to earth upon it at
once. The poor victim was still alive, and its
pitiful complaints could be heard as it was borne
away. The rosellas assembled in a green tree with
much clatter and excitement, but the police of
bird-land, the magpies, appeared and so worried the
hawk that at last it dropped its prey and escaped.
Magpies have no fear even of eagles.
* * * *
“W.P.T.”: On the N.S.W. South Coast
there is a species of wild fig, which grows like a
Moreton Bay except that its branches commence
from the ground. If one remains under the tree
inhaling the perfume, which is rather pleasant, he
will experience drowsiness, followed by a violent
headache. Even stock are affected. One of these
trees grew in the Candelo school-yard, but its
sleep-producing effect on the children, especially
when it was in bloom, became so evident that the
schoolmaster instructed the youngsters to keep away
from it and eventually it was cut down and burnt.
I have travelled all over Australia, but have seen
these trees growing in only two localities, viz., the
South Coast of N.S.W. and the inside of the
Northern Territory.
* * * *
“Coot”: “Polycarp” asks (B. 17/9/’25)
whether the male or female eoachwhip-bird gives
the crack at the end of the call. The reliable Lucas
and Le Souef (“Birds of Australia”) assert that it
is the male, but that when the call is finished off
with a sharp “twitt-twitt” it is the lady who has
the last word. Many bushmen, however, assert that
the one bird is responsible for the whole performance.
* * * *
“Outback” : The caterpillars of two moths
devour the leaves of eucalypts. First there is the
cup-moth, a strangely shaped little fellow covered
with yellow, green and pink spines that can inflict
a painful sting. At times there is a positive plague
of the creatures, and acres of gums are robbed of
their leaves and consequently retarded in growth.
The second caterpillar is the well-known proees-
sionary. These sting with the long hairs covering
their bodies. By day they live in a silken bag
attached to twigs, which in course of time break
by reason of the accumulated weight, and the nests
fall to the ground. They feed at night and are
careful to lay a silken thread to guide them back
to the nest. When full grown they pupate in the
ground, often near the base of the tree where the
clusters of cocoons may be found.
* * * *
“H.W.M.H.”: “J.T.T.” (B. 17/9/’25)
states that the English magpie is rarely seen,
except in secluded woods. At my old home in North
Bucks (Eng.) it is quite common. One frequently
sees a magpie’s nest—a huge ball of sticks with
a hole in the side for the bird to enter by—on the
top of a hawthorn hedge or in a tree.
* * * *
“Pick” : The corruption of place-names in
Australia has usually been due to rough attempts to
Anglic ise the native nomenclature. In one instance
at least the process has been reversed. When the
early settlers along the Upper Murrumbidgee first
viewed the site of the present big dam they named
the two mountains whose buttresses converge upon
the narrow pass where the dam head was erected
Black Andrew and Barren Jack. The former,
covered with black wattle, was so called from its
dark appearance, arid the latter because of its rocky
and bare aspect. The name “Burrinjuck” was an
unlovely attempt to fix the abo. language where it
should be plain English, but old residents of the
part persist in their refusal to adopt the changed
name,
* * * *
“Pyramus” : N. S. Wales is rich in relics
of the ousted aboriginal, and in some districts there
have been commendable attempts to preserve these
historical memorials , front the hand of time and
the vandal. But the carving on the heights of Ball's
Head (Sydney), depicting a ludicrous likeness of a
shark, is sadly in need of some attention. The only
existing evidence of Bumble’s care is a rotten two-
rail fence and an illegible notice apparently intended
to warn off destructive children. Crudely traced on
a sandstone “canvas” of about 10 feet Square, the
presence of this specimen of Binghi’s art is known
to few. Though it nestles in the shadow of the
giant coaling station, the surrounding district is
sparsely settled, thereby affording the plot a little
immunity. Nevertheless, the local councils should
wake ud to their obligations.
LET SLEEPING ANGELS LIE.
MRDIUM: “I am now in touch with your
dear wife’s departed spirit. Would you
like.to say anything to her?”
CLIENT: “My Gawd, no! I don’t want to
start anything.”
“Bunya”: The big sea-slugs which are
collected along the Great Barrier Reef to be sold as
beche-de-mer to the Chows are punky fellows in the
matter of self-defence. They look slow and harmless
as they crawl over the sandy bottoms, sweeping the
sand and mud into their large mouths, but when
attacked or alarmed they defend themselves by at
once discharging a mass of liquid stuff into the water.
As soon as this comes into contact with the briny
it changes into a network of white threads which
hopelessly entangle the enemy ; even the largest lob-
sters are bound up long enough for the slug to get
well away. The discharge is really a part of the
body, and grows again like a lizard’s tail.

Most homes have their garden or lawns.
They beautify the surroundings and are the
pride of the household. During the hot
months the preservation of the flowers,
shrubs and lawns is a matter of concern.
Frequent use of the Garden Hose is the only
salvation. The cost of a good hose is not
much—especially when it is of the hard wear-
ing, non-kinking, non-splitting type such as
DUNLOP
Garden Hos®
Millions of feet of this Australian-made Hose
is in use throughout Australasia giving
years of service and satisfaction to users. It’s
being dragged about and subjected to all
kinds of ill-use, but its fine quality and con-
struction gives it the durability to stand up
to years of such use. It is made in three
brands—Dunlop, Oceanic and Federal—and
is without doubt the most economical and
dependable garden hose made. It costs
no more than other hose-the difference is
in the excellent and certain service you get
from it. Ask for Dunlop Hose-its your
guarantee of satisfaction.

LETTER

GIOVES
The Governor-General and his lady paid
their respects to Sydney on Friday, and
the city reciprocated with a dazzling smile
and a breezy manner. Central station was
arrayed in hunting for the arrival by ex-
press from Melbourne, and our own Gov-
ernor Sir Dudley, in admiral’s kit, and
Lady de Chair, in attire as good but not so
gaudy, had their vice-regal feet on the rim-
ing board the minute the train drew up.
Premier Lang, four buzzing aeroplanes in the
blue, a spick-and-span guard of honor and
the swinging kilts of a Highland band were
other decorations of the Great Moment. The
Governor-General, ribboned and decorated
and crested like a de luxe cockatoo, turned a
keen eye, a soft chin and a firm mouth to the
hundreds who came out to give him a cheer.
Lady Stonehaven wore a pleasing profile
under a tightly-fitting hat, and was, no doubt,
as pleased as her husband to see the front
door of Government House. He, of course,
greeted it as an old friend. Thirty years ago,
in the roaring ’nineties, he was a merry and
innocent A.D.C. within its cloistered walls.
Lord Mayor Stokes hosted a civic cheerio, and
in the afternoon Government House drive
was trodden by a procession of church dig-
nitaries and publicans (at least they repre-
sented public bodies), each bearing an ivory
scroll of welcome to the King's anointed.
Lady Stonehaven may be a countess in her
own right some day. As the eldest daughter
of the Earl of Kintore she is second in line
of succession. The direct heir is her younger
brother, Lord Falconer, who is 46 years of
age and unmarried; and the Kintore earl-
dom was created (1677) “with succession to
heir's female in default of male.”
All • the lucky little girls and boys in
Sydney (there were nearly 2000 of them)
went to Peter Pan’s party on Saturday
afternoon. By 2 o’clock hundreds of eager
kiddies were on the Palais doorsteps, and
half an hour later you could scarcely turn
without bumping into a twittering little girl
canary in a cage pursued by two gay black
pussies; or an active Jack-in-the-box who
kept, bobbing out of it to see the world
passing by; or a frightened Puss-in-boots
who was crying for a lost mummie. There
was a snow-white swan and a proud white
peacock. Eastern Queens and Vanities
there were, sailors and soldiers, Boy Blues.
Columbines and powder-puffs in the gayest
of confusion ; but all had the same capacity
for ice-cream and lucky-dips. State Gover-
nor’s daughter Elaine led off the grand march
as darling Wendy, squired by a debonair
Peter Pan, who turned out to be brother Som-
erset. They had brought some Struben
cousins with them, and the Tony Horderns’
children, who are also cousins of the
Strubens, finished off the family party.
Rupert Markham, who had compiled a tower-
ing pyramid of publicity in the cause of the
money-maker for Tressillian, turned up as
Father Christmas, and was followed the
whole afternoon by groups of adoring young-
sters. Josephine Marks was the inspired
mistress of the pageant, and Mrs. Mc-
Elhone president of the revels. Charlie Chap-
lin used the dense crowds to help his escape
from jus’tiice, making excited small ones|
accessories after the fact by imploring them
not to tell the policeman they had seen him.
And an adventurer of seven or thereabouts,
after Heaven alone knows what intrepid
courage and subtlety, had slipped past 'lie
Argus on the door, and grimy but jubilant,
demanded from some grown-ups where the
paper-caps were given away. Of course he
got his cap and a trumpet and a dip, and
stayed till the end of the party; for isn’t
the world just a treasure-chest for your
buccaneer?
The petunias spread velvety cloaks about
the fountain in the*garden of Wentworth
House on Saturday; but the wistaria vines
were only misted here and there with a be-
lated mauve glory. On the green lawns and
flagged verandahs of the historic home Aus-
tralia of all ages and sizes had gathered to
honor the memory of William Charles Went-
worth, “the father of the Constitution.”
Walter Marks, M.L.A., made the stirring
speech of the occasion, and as the last
words fainted into the blue and green of
the afternoon the band burst joyously into
“Advance, Australia Fair!”
How far from Trafalgar are the paper cap
and the jazz of these dancing nights? No
distance at all, think Royal Prince Alfred
Yacht clubbers; so it was with them that
they celebrated the anniversary of Nelson’s
victory. The Ambassadors, in an aura of
navy and scarlet, the club's colors, was the
rallying-point; and Commodore Sir Dudley
de Chair brought not only his lady, but
daughter Elaine as well, Captain Coote being
the official stand-by. Lady de Chair’s
swathings were of satin and chiffon, as bluely
green as the harbor on a spring morning; a
thick dusting of milky beads was the dress-
architect's poetic way of expressing the
foam. Elaine was white chiffon tied up
with silver tissue, like a Christmas bon-bon.
Vice-Commodore Andrew Wilson squired his
lady, in the soft charm of ivory lace; and
Rear-Commodore Oscar Curtis and the John
Buchanan couple, she in blue and silver,
were other of the night’s important people.
Befurred women with a diamond glinting
here and there, clutching the latest thing in
envelope purses; serge-coated women carry-
ing string bags or their cretonne counter-
parts ; women out for the morrow’s food sup-
ply. and women out to Save the Empire—
they all met in the Town Hall the other
afternoon to concentrate on the downfall of
Communism. The occasion was a rally of
the Nationalist party and the roll-up would
have cheered Priminister Bruce even as the
spider bucked his namesake. Four thousand
women, strong, weak or convalescent, filled
the galleries and the seats that lurk beneath.
The galleries wore red, white and blue ban-
deaux (it was Trafalgar Day, you remem-
ber), execrating Communism, its words and
its works; and the stage wore a flag-draped
table, Miss Preston Stanley and a group of
minor prophetesses against a background of
enthusiasts parked on the organ seats.
The girls of the Public Service wore their
best frocks on their newest contours (of
course they’ve been giving the farinaceous
the cut direct like the rest of us) at the
Palais. And never has the Palais band
passed judgment on a more attractive lot of
damsels. It looked like the dance beauty-
contest, with every entrant a winner. Pre-
mier Lang’s lady was president of the com-
mittee, and was striking (simmer down!
the word is used in its pre-Bolshie sense) in
black chiffon velvet with mediaeval embroi-
of attractive daughters. Agnes Scobie, who
shimmered like a Lorelei in a frock that
seemed made of frosty moonlight, and Eileen
Ryan, in Persian blue and silver, secretaried
to everybody’s satisfaction. Grace Scobie
sat enthroned in a front box —a knee jarred
in a tram accident the other day kept her in
her place—a sort of unofficial Queen of the
Night in black silk velvet splashed with
beaten-silver embroideries.
Herewith a May Moore picture of Mar-
jorie Cocks, who made her bow as an orator
at the Na-
tionalist rally
the other day
in the Town
Hall. Marjorie
is a daughter
of that padre
Cocks who
was the well-
loved slie p-
herd of the
Pitt - street
Congrega-
tional fold for
many years.
Marjorie is a
graduate of
Sydney Uni.,
and lias the
same flair for
literature and
the spoken
word as her
erudite father
had. The 1014 outbreak caught her at her
studies in Germany, and she had such a
trying time with Britain’s opponents that
she is now a double-strength daughter of
the Empire. If she goes on as brilliantly as
she began Miss Preston Stanley will have
to rivet her laurels as our first woman-
orator to her raven locks.
The coldest blasts of last week keened over
the garden party at the Women’s College,
and tore a hole in the pastoral that was
staged on the lower lawn. Ironically enough
it was “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,”
though the only dream possible in such a
temperature was of blanket and eiderdown.
There was tennis, in which the Tilflesley
Shield was fiercely battled for by energetic
young things; and, later, quantities of tea
and what-nots were absorbed in the dining-
hall by the bigwigs of every secondary school
in and about Sydney.
The District Nurses didn’t allow much
grass to grow under their feet last year. The
ten visited 2024 patients, and made a total
of 19,144 sick calls —nearly 2000 apiece
To the story, told at the annual meeting one
day last week at the Nurses’ Home at Glebe
Point, Lady de Chair turned an attentive
ear. The cry of the meeting was, of course,
“Give us funds or we perish.” Dr Purdy
spoke of poverty and streets in Kedfern
where whole families live in one room. It
is among such as these that their work takes
the District Nurses, and indeed their coming
into the lives of these dwellers in misery
must be something like the visitation of
angels. Drs. Guy Griffiths and Harvey'
Sutton and padres Micklem and Charlton
wedded entreaty to eulogy of the nurses. In
the election of office-bearers for the present
year Lady de Chair was once more made
president.
One of the most interesting shows of the
week to a woman’s way of thinking was the
eisteddfod organised by the Girls of Business
Houses Association. Like the lady in the
famed Billy Boy chantey, she can bake and
she can , sew; and no doubt, though not
called upon to do so in any of the contests,
she can make the Irish stew and the cherry
pie. The show at St. James’s proved, too,
that she hasn’t neglected the arts. Em-
broideries, paintings and drawings speak of
many hours passed in pursuit of beauty. It
isn’t only jazz and movie with the business-
girl the minute her typewriter is covered !
This nice-looking girl is Lucy Bruntncll,
whose father is tin' ex-Minister for Educa-
t i o n. Lucy
goes off early
next year to
study drama-
tic art at the
Royal Aca-
demy, her am-
bition being

to the Austra-
lian Sara h
Siddo n s or
Ellen Terry.
Valerie Kings
bury (now Mrs.

Thomas have
all helped to
mould Lucy’s
art, and ap-
Pearances
with Gregan McMahon’s Repertorians have
given her stage ease. The clever girl has
done some producing for charity, and is re-
membered for successful efforts on behalf
of the Parramatta District Hospital. A
testimonial concert at the Conservatorium
in Miss Bruntnell’s honor will happen on
November 7. Picture from May Moore’s
studio.
The ballroom of the Australia was as
animated as one of those cafe scenes in a
movie last Friday when Marie Narelle was
welcomed home by her friends. Literally
hundreds of women exchanged handclasps
and kisses with the tall and glowing singer.
Standing at the top of the long avenues of
tea tables, supported by sparkling nieces
Kathleen and Nell Bourke, the guest of
honor, sleek in rich terra-cotta to which
sables and a ravishing black bonnet were
added, was very striking in her brunette good
looks. Cousins and family friends from
miles back had journeyed to town for the
gathering; and Mayoress Cecilia Walsh
dropped in for a friendly word. Mrs. Dun-
rich, who as brilliant pianist Hilda Thorn-
dyke used to play Marie’s accompaniments,
was an early comer; so were cousin Mrs.
Ken Prior and old New York friend Hilda
Aiken, the latter very smart in black, with
a white plume like a bottle-brush jutting
at an angle of 45deg. between the crown and
the brim of her hat. Hilda, aided by Jack
Griffiths, looked after the programme, and
the music was a succession of star turns
which included the melting sweetness of
“Annie Laurie” and “The Last Rose of
Summer” in Alfred O’Shea’s soothering
tenor. Mrs. Trefle M.C.’d in rich trappings
of beige satin and a large black hat, and
brought pretty daughter Kathleen, as shy
as a primrose, in pale yellow georgettes.
The W. P. McElhone, Alexander Weigall
and Orwell Phillips matrons, with a long-
list of others, worked together for good at
the matinee in aid of the Day Nurseries. By
2 o’clock the Royal was booked out, and the
vestibule was a seething, money-grubbing
tidal wave that submerged you in pro-
grammes, sweets, flowers by the armful and
buttonholes before you could run to cover.
The programme was the usual programme of
the charity matinee, and included favorites
like Hector St. Clair, Renee Maxwell and
the sparkling “Snap” girls. Marie Narelle
in grey georgettes and a Marcel wave beyond
price, placed low down on the bill so that
the vice-reine could hear her when she and
Elaine came on late from opening the C. of E,
fair at the Town Hall, was one of the big
attractions. Nellie Stewart as a dashing
Rosaline won the reception of the afternoon,
and a sort of Madame Tussaud’s was run by
Sunbeam Mylius, in which society misses
posed waxenly as their own ancestors. One
beruffed woman caused an argument in the
back stalls. “That’s Queen Elizabeth, of
course; but I didn’t know she had her hair
short, did you?” “No,” snapped a harassed
neighbor; “according to report she gener-
ally had it off!”
Of the thousands who were abroad on
Saturday afternoon Abbotsford Point
claimed a lion’s share. The lawns of the
Branch, the Sydney Rowers’ clubhouse, were
brilliant with summer frocks and hectic sun-
shades, for the club was entertaining the
family friends of itself and the University
Rowing Club at their combined regatta. Vet-
eran skipper Q. L. Deloitte kept his eye
nailed to the colors of both clubs, and Judge
Backhouse, Judge Cohen, and Coyle, K.C.,
stood together in solemn conclave. Genial
George Portus brought liis lady; and the
happy-looking Kendall pair, the Harold
Weigalls and a pretty Coyle girl were among
the hundreds.
The G.-G. Stonehavens were boxed with
the State Exes, on Saturday night at Her
Majesty’s. “Leave it to Jane,’’ evidently, to
keep a tired-out vice-regal wide awake! At
any rate, the G.-G. wasn’t observed trying
to snatch forty winks, although he had been
scouting and yachting since the early
morning hours. Lady Stonehaven was
very smart in a gold and green bro-
cade coat, her hair filleted (it sounds like
whiting, doesn’t it?) with a diamond-
crusted band. Our State vice-reine glowed
like amber; Elaine was silver and rose; and
Mrs. Budge’s shawl was the green of
Celadon glaze.
Nearly 200 bridge-players were beckoned
into Farmer’s Exhibition Hall last Friday
by Mrs. George Wright, whose lord is man-
aging-director of the Pitt-street shrine. Mrs.
Wright, who is an enthusiast in the cause
of the Blue Bird Kindergarten, arranged the
party for its benefit, and welcomed her
guests in lobelia-blue frocking, while on the
walls about her. and through the air above
her, flights of bluebirds apparently wheeled
and circled. The decorations were quite
distinctive, and myriads of sapphire-blue
lights made a blue ether for the winging
flocks.
Dr. W. B. Studdy, of North Sydney, mur-
mured “Take her, my child,” to son Stuart
the other day when that young man an-
nounced his engagement to Helen Bull, also
of North Sydney. Stuart, like his Helen,
is a youngest child, and, like his father,
sells health for a livelihood.
The pretty wedding of the week happened
at St. Patrick's when Winifred Lawler, of
Manly, became the wife of Lieutenant John
Dewis, of Cliatswood. Popular Father
Piquet O.K.’d the vows, and the bride, who
was given away by brother Edmund, as-
sembled in her raiment silver brocaded tissue,
white rucked georgette, a cascade of tulle
veiling and a wealth of orange buds.
Josephine and Mary Cox ’maided in rosy
chiffons and gold tissue turbans. Two
soldier-cliums of the groom, Lieut. 11.
Edwards and Lieut. Stratton, stood by both
through the ceremony and later through the
cake-cutting at the Wentworth, where bride’s
mother hostessed in frocking that toned in
with the Blue Room.
Brisbane’s innocent diversions :
The Creche and Kindergarten shook their money-
boxes on the 23rd and held up the acquiescing traffic
while perfect weather smiled. Decorated lorries
full of the country’s greatest asset—pretty exhibits
in chubby cheeks —paraded Queen-street, led by
some of Queensland’s finest police horses and. a
band of small boys. The Country Women’s Associa-
tion answered 600 callers at its city rest-room
during a crowded seven days.
For Joan Elliott, whom Otto Hirschfeld will
shortly carry off, Mrs. Gilbert Elliot gave a party
at Illaroo, amid copper-colored nasturtiums and
gay gerberas. Aileen Thompson combined mah jongg
with tea and cake at her flat in Wickham-terrace
in the same cause.
Marjorie Mactaggart, who is soon going to Mel-
bourne to be married, has also been, feted. The
Robinson girls had a mah jongg for her at Clay-
field amid silver vases of pink larkspur and pierrot
place-cards and blue-birds.
Tom Welsby talked about the Bay he knows so
well at the Yacht Club on Nelson’s Day. Music
and elocution, in which Harry Borradale figured,
passed a cheerful hour or two.
The Authors and Artists gathered at the Women’s
Club to hear Ned Colclough accuse the Australian
painter of not mixing his colors with enough of
the good Australian sunlight. Mrs. Cumbrae Stewait
replied with an allusion to Penleigh-Boyd’s laugh-
ing land- and sea-scapes, and a lively discussion
followed in which “Tarboy” Brown and one Hiley,
a seasoned bushman who has been four times from
end to end of the continent, joined.
At the State Orchestra’s mass attack at the
Exhibition, Myrtle Power, in rose-tinted lace with
a silver pattern of grapes, soloed attractively.
Arthur Sharman and Gordon Rodda filled the Albert
Hall that night for their recital, and Ivy Plane’s
delightful notes drew many flowers, much chocolate
and applause out of an enthusiastic audience. Arthur
Sharman was particularly pleasing in Hungarian
folklore melodies, and Gladys Frost sat at the key-
board.

Your Christmas Phonograph is something from which you
expect to gain satisfaction for many years—so it is hardly
fair to select it on a hurried visit round the shops.
The names of various instruments will occur to you readily—if their dealers
believe in their machines they will willingly send you one (without obligation) to
hear in your own home. Likewise the New Edison dealer will be only too glad
to let you have a New Edison to place beside the others.
Then let your ears decide —nothing could be fairer!

Melbourne's weather registered another
surprise on Saturday by smiling gorgeously
over Henley-on-Yarra. What a time the
annual amateur regatta is for the business
hoy and girl—the lucky she who takes the
river snuggled amid pillows matching the
inner lining of the lucky lie’s canoe, her
millinery and parasol attuning, and herself
the envy of the thousands of her sex who
gaze upon the scene from the banks! From
midday nicely-brushed young men in immacu-
late flannels, accompanied by lots of bare
arm and near-silk covered leg, crowded to
the river, laden with cushions, food, paper
umbrellas and ukuleles, to spend the rest of
the day and most of the evening paddling
the assorted cargo around. Mum and Dad
and all the family plunged into the happy
throng on shore, clutching balloons, kewpies
on canes and Chinese curshades. The more
cautious of the onlookers cheered up dark
and warm attire with fussy bright hats
which the green slopes and the background
of palms and newly-folioged oak-trees set off
charmingly.
Once Henley-011 -Yarra ranked among Mel-
bourne’s smart social functions, and all the
naicest clubs had their houseboats. This
year the fleet was limited to five. The
Mayoral Bruntons —she in summery tan and
blue spotted silk, with roses poised upon a
brown hat —put to sea on one that was all
cerise and blue draperies, roses and lights,
with touches of black, surrounded by window-
boxes of foliage plants and cerise sweet-peas.
The G.-G.’s small girls gazed upon their first
Australian Henley from this resplendent
Noah’s ark, whose passenger-list included
suburban mayors and mayoresses, Mel-
bourne’s Cathedral Arch, and Mrs. Harring-
ton Lees, the Weedon dame and knight James
Barrett and his lady. From a houseboat
where W. Cattanach and Mrs. Cattanach
trod the quarter-deck waved “the old” and
the recently-adopted new flag of the Scotch
College, over which have been shed the bitter
tears of the young that were. 11. M.
Strachan, president of the Melbourne Ama-
teur Regatta Association, with Mrs.
Strachan, spread tea on their coracle for a
crowd, among whom was Governor Strad-
lirolce. Pink and mauve roses, water-lilies
and winged insects of the same hues and
silver, set off this structure. The black-and-
white colors of the ’Varsity Sports Union
and navy and pale blue of the Uni. marked
other headquarters, and the subscribers to
the M.A.R. and Australia Club members
foregathered on a houseboat that was mostly
garlands of roses, blue and orange. A
parade of decorated canoes, gay with bal-
loons, or with green thatched roof and
“roses round the door” showed much artistic
talent.
Evening found the crowd no smaller, and
the bands still playing for couples dancing on
the lawn in a ballroom lit by soaring rockets;
and at midnight the committee locked up
the proceeds of a successful festival at which
some honors went to inter-State rowers.
Phalanxes of sylk-artoed legs stamped a
welcome to “Street-singer” Gladys Moncrieff
on Saturday night at the Royal; and when
Tom Moore stepped out of the background to
trip an unlisted measure with his lady, the
legs became almost inarticulate. Matrimony
seems to have added weight to the Ban an a-
iamler’s warbling find taken it from her fig-
ure. From behind a dividing range of flowers
she murmured the usual husky “Thank
you” at the final demonstration, and
Claude Flemming said the rest. A
weakish plot and reminiscent music were
helped out by effective f rocking which
enabled the leading lady to exhibit a Wedg-
wood blue beaded georgette punctuated with
feather trimming and a gown of white satin
with a glimmering train that brought a
gasp of jay from the family-circle. Nell
Payne’s nifty little black-and-green cape suit
is likely to have many copyists, and the
gowns and millinery of the ladies of the
chorus convey some fascinating suggestions
for day and evening wear. First-nighters
included the Stuart Bruntons, the Norman
Brookes pair, Dr. and Mrs. Bob Strong, Mrs.
Goeller, Mrs. W. M. Robins, Mrs. do Bavay,
M. and Madame Turck and Mrs. Douglas
Stewart.
At the Moonee Valley Racing Club’s Cup
meeting on Saturday feminine apparel leaned
towards black and the tailored suit, though
fi few folk grabbed the chance of the
wonderful weather to wear their new
season's best. Mrs. Pitt Rivers re-
ceived congratulations on her promo-
tion to the rank of professional actress
in black with a headpiece of cherry crino-
line straw and velvet. Black georgette steel-
headed and a lime straw hat were borne
by Mrs. Iliskens, while her daughter. Mrs.
Ronald Irving, enlivened a black frock with
gold and millinery in mole and blue. Lorn a
Hiskens was all pleats of champagne-lined
georgette and wee pearl buttons. Mrs. Am-
brose Gaffney, from the Harbor, topped
sealing-wax red with a black hat. Brown
and fawn plaid and natural kasha formed
Mrs. Murray Morton’s toilette, daughter Ula
being wrapped in fawn shades. Mrs. Leroy
Burnham, just back from the Great Smoke,
prinked up black with touches of red. In
the intervals interest was divided between
the wearer of a lemon-lined shawl embroi-
dered in blue butterflies, and the one-time-
much -before-tlie-public Connie Waugh, slim,
flaxen-haired, a study in biscuit tones, with
a band of diamonds around one silk-hosed
tinkle. A neck-to-knee sleeveless crimson
frock, suggesting the surf rather than the
turf, created another flutter.
Eighty English Speakers waved their
parasols in compliment to the brains behind
the match-box when viewing how the
wheels go round in Bryant and May’s big
factory the other day. The firm, in turning
out its vestas and safeties, does everything
but grow the timber. Wondering eyes wit-
nessed the huge logs from Bananaland’s far
jungles turn into boxes, papered, labelled,
filled with matches, rolled in packets and
cased for sea, rail or road, and huge bales
of cotton become 84 miles of taper for the
“waxies." Sheets of tin. varnished, dried in
ovens and cut and twisted by almost human
machinery, came out metal boxes for vestas.
Smoothly-moving machines were everywhere
passing things to one another after adding
tlieir little hit to make the finished article.
Bright, happy; healthy girls and young
women in saxe-blue overalls fed them.
Many of the most novel instruments are the
creation of that inventive genius, manager
A. F. Ney; and it speaks much for Austra-
lian workmanship that the firm’s shop here
has constructed mechanism for the factories
of the company abroad. That the firm con-
siders “all work and no play” isn't a good
maxim is demonstrated in the fine tennis
courts, baseball ground, the splendid club-
rooms and a big recreation hail, where the
merry jazz is indulged in daily by the
workers to the accompaniment of a pianola.
A comfortable midday meal is provided, and
under Sister Rcay, who has four and a half
years’ war service to her credit, there is a
First Aid department. The E.S.U. members
spoke their thanks for the fascinating couple
of hours —this over a cup of tea and cake,
spread in the attractive hall. Incidentally,
they carried off samples of the wares of
B. and M. and an admirably got-up booklet
illustrating the industry.
Pictured here by the Dickinson-Monteath
studios is Mrs. Harold Clapp, wife of Vie-
toria’s Chief
C o mmissioner
of Railways.
When she was
Vivie Noel,
daughter of a
B a n a naland

teur actress,

the you n g
A u s t ralian
railway engi-
neer who was making his mark in America;
and returning with him a couple of years ago
she became an enthusiastic worker for many
good causes. At the moment she is fear-
fully busy on a play for which Frank St.
Ledger is to supply the music.
The handy and artistic ones of the Lyceum
Club had their first show in the club’s recep-
tion room the other afternoon. President
Mrs. J. G. Latham, in cigar-hued crepe
georgette, overrun with tracery of white, and
a tan ribbon hat, pronounced the benediction.
The canvases bore the names of most of Mel-
bourne’s best-known women painters, besides
charming pastel portraits by Dora Wilson
and sculpture by Margaret Baskerville. The
landscapes of Jessie Traill, E. Barlow and
Mrs. G. Gulliver, the flower studies of Marion
Jones, Mrs. C. Southern Flinn and May Vale
Gilfillan and the illustrations of Ethel
Spowers are best remembered. Amongst the
crafts, the enamelling of Mrs. Charles Court-
ney and a length of natural wool-cloth hand-
spun by Miss Gordon linger in the mind.
Mrs. Walker Sinclair, who brought Lady
Heath, from the Great Smoke, had an in-
teresting exhibit in a curio table illustrating
French marqueterie, the antique design con-
sisting of the crests, coat of arms and tartan
of her family, the clan Ferguson.
Members of the many-sided English-Speak-
ing Union landed with dripping umbrellas
and damp coats at Scott’s Hotel the other
afternoon to sip tea with Edna Thomas
and chat about our common tongue. The
lady from Louisiana, whose folk hailed from
Dorsetshire and Somerset, wore magpie rai-
ment of georgette and satin, with red blos-
soms at the waist-line and a lace-draped
black hat. In her fluent discourse she put
in a plea to local songsters to sing in their
own good language. Not that the lady is
narrow-minded; she begged Australia not to
plaster its cities with ad. hoardings like
England and America, but to follow the
better French lead in that matter. Presi-
dent Donald Mackinnon; Mrs. Mackinnon,
black-coated, with a beige-liued feather upon
black millinery; Mrs. Harold Clapp, beneath
whose black fur coat appeared a rust-toned
frock topped by a like hat; and Mrs. M.
K. McMillan, black robed, did the honors.
Pianist Constance Piper was at the party
in rust-ribbon chapeau and a cream woollen
suit; Mrs. J. L. Reid came out of the rain
in a fawn gown, brightened with toque of
royal-blue; and Mrs. Gilbert Lodge brought
a breath of the cave-era with leopard-skin
and a Wrap of kolinsky.
The bright eyes belong to Alice Richard-
son, who for some three years has been a
valued co m-
mittee me m-
ber of the
Austral Salon.

The programme presented at llis Majesty’s
for St. Vincent’s Hospital repeated more or
less the capital show given at the Maggie
Moore benefit of the previous week. A de-
lightful extra was supplied by small girls,
visions in deep rose and silver and led by
sweet-voiced Gracie Emerson, whose fairy
feet had been trained by Jennie Brenan.
Also some society maidens as rainbow pier-
rots and pierrettes made good showing in a
ballet headed by Mrs. Kingsbury Baillieu,
who lately was the vivacious Gracie Lavers
of the J.C.W. Musical Comedy Co. Wilma
Clarke, Biddy Tallis, Nancy Barrett and
Gwen Tait were of the amateur ballerinas,
and Thelma Kurtzman added some intricate
solo work. A not quite happy introduction
was the final heat of a dancing competition
in which the stage resembled an any-night
scene at a suburban palais, with young men
looking as if they had washed round in their
office suits, and their partners in day frocks
and cloche millinery. The Tallis lady organ-
ised the show, which poured over £lOOO into
the hospital coffers.
The newest spring millinery makes the
housewife grieve that she parted with her
old faded head-coverings, for fashion runs to
colored hats whose crowns have the appear-
ance of long exposure. A pink, blue or
heliotrope straw which dies away to almost
white at the summit is the very latest shriek.
In a frock of silver-embroidered saxe-blue
and a harmonious hat, Francie Moore said
“I will” to Harold Abbott at St. Paul’s. The
bride, who was head dispenser at the Alfred
Hospital, is a daughter of late Police-Magis-
trate Notley Moore, and the happy man’s
father is the well-known M.L.C., of Bendigo.
The Lyceum Club was warmed up by the
congratulations and the tea.
Dr. Vera Seantlebury, who has been in-
vited by the Victorian Government to see
how Maoriland’s baby looks under the Truby
King regime, belongs to a family which seems
naturally to burn a red lamp. Her late
father was a noted sawbones, and her brother
hangs out his plate in Collins-street. Her
own brilliant career took in the Melbourne
Hospital, the superintendency of the Child-
ren’s Hospital, control of the Victorian
health centres, and war service with the
R.A.M.C.; and last year she capped it all
by securing the M.D. of Melbourne Uni., and
then went off to Canada and U.S.A. for
further information. Dr. Henrietta Main,
an English doctor, goes hand-in-hand with
her to the King Country.
Mrs. H. J. Robertson, president of the
Women's Automobile Club, put on a melodic
menu for the usual fortnightly meeting of
the petrol-users last week. Soprano Muriel
Benton, pianist Alice Madigan, Valeria
Berger and tenor Victor Baxter were the
music-makers.
Mrs. John Fisken’s home at Toorak staged
the party of the week in a wonderful floral
setting that featured pink roses and rhodo-
dendrons, and had a string orchestra’s accom-
paniment. Black picture millinery with
American beauty roses allied to black crepe
meteor framed the hostess; her daughter,
Mrs. Tom Grantham, always smart, chose
blendings of brown, fawn and gold. There
was hardly a flake of the upper crust miss-
ing from the party.
The Albert-street Con. had a visit from
Lady lleath last week, when members of the
Fritz Hart choir raised their voices in oper-
atic selections. The visitor from overseas
lias some knowledge of music, having studied
piano and singing at the Royal Academy,
where she also occasionally gave a hand in
teaching.
Dame Nellie still keeps an eye on the
Albert-street Conservatorium. Writing from
Vienna she announces her capture of two
more scholarships for promising Australian
songbirds at the Conservatorium. One of
them has been donated by the well-known
composer Bemberg. Our Queen of Song, at
the time of writing, was well on the way to
recovery from an illness due largely to dental
trouble.
A Phil May drawing, “Measuring the
Baby.” is being raffled for the St. Vincent's
Hospital appeal. Saxon Fisher, son of the
late Edmund, the lucky possessor, is handing
it over for the good cause.
The ghosts of Gilbert and Sullivan are
abroad. Since the announcement of the
coming G. and S. season, no concert is com-
plete without a budding tenor bidding his
suffering audience “Take a Pair of Sparkling
Eyes,” or a soprano wrestling with the top
notes of “Poor Wandering One.” What a
time we are in for! Stopping home won't
remedy it, for at this very moment the gramo-
phone’ in the flat above is warbling excerpts
from “Pinafore” and the player-piano across
the way is grinding out “The Gondoliers.”
There will be some use for “Patience,” at
any rate.
Adelaide toasts “The Press” :
What a week! Dinners, luncheons, picnics and
speeches ; inspection of schools, vineyards and cellars
and speeches; flying trips per motor to the Murray,
Angaston and Victor Harbor and speeches; finally
the stowing of exhausted Press delegates into tile
West-bound train with the cheering knowledge that,
thanks to Tom AValsh, most of them will have time
to do little more than glance at Kalgoorlie and
tumble aboard again to pick up the Maloja here.
The Press-people’s programme has included
some brilliantly successful frivols. At Birksgate,
on a Heaven-sent day, Mrs. Barr Smith hostessed a
gathering whereat Victoria League workers were
bidden to meet the skirted members of the delegation
while their lords were casting appreciative eyes on
Holden’s motor-body works. A nip in the wind made
autumn of the day, but the garden was all spring,
with the blue rim of the sea over the plains in the
distance, and the hills behind all purple with “Salva-
tion Jane.” Guests included Dorothea Spinney,
compelled by the tricks Melbourne dust has played
With her throat to cancel for the second time the
programme she came over specially to give; and the
Frank Mouldens, just back from England and America
with the conviction that prohibition is a costly farce.
The visitors saw one of the choice gardens of
Mt. Lofty when S’Langdon Bonython bade them
admire his rhododendrons at Carminow, and, thanks to
E. A. Brooks of Buckland Park, they saw the station
where the King shot when he was a duke. A bare
23 miles from Adelaide, it boasts peacocks for deco-
rative purposes, kangaroos for local color and a
lock whereby the owner floods his paddocks for
fattening purposes.
On local hostesses has depended a large share of
the week’s success. In a city so bankrupt of hotels,
private billeting was the only solution, and delegates
have been scattered through the suburbs—the Burn-
hams with the Evan Kyffin Thomases at North
Adelaide, the Reeds at St. Peter’s College with Mr.
Bickerstetli, the Davieses with the Dudley Haywards
and the Newneses with the Ernest Goods at Prospect.
For the rest there have been lunches with the Com-
monwealth Club and Chamber of Commerce (these
for men only), a word from Lord Burnham to teach-
ers, and a visit to St. Peter’s College (with a half-
holiday begged by Lady Burnham), a Navy League
meeting whereat Mr. Long was the speaker, and,
as a final frivol, an, impromptu party at the Glenelg
Palais, where Mrs. Dutton was hostess.
Otherwise the social calendar has been mostly
blank ; but Miss Judy Whitby and her pupils found
time to stage an excellent programme of dancing at
St. Peter’s, with proceeds for the T.B. soldiers at
Bedford Park ; and there have been Gifl Guide com-

NOTIONS
Those backers of Manfred who thought
it was merely a matter of the colt leaving the
barrier smartly for him to win the W. S. Cox Plate
at Moonee Valley (Vic.) had some exciting moments
on Saturday. In the early part of the betting the
A.J.C. Derby colt was 11 to 8 on ; then even money
was laid, and at the close it was 5 to 4 on. The
N igtit Patrol was 6 to 4, Pantheon 14 to 1, Royal
Charter 20’s, Valamita and Hampden 50’s. Manfred
drew No. 7 —the outside position—next to Hampden,
and Dempsey had little trouble in getting him to
face the machine. When the barrier lifted, he swung
in and collided with Hampden, but the bump"
seemed to straighten him up, and a.s they turned
out of the straight he was about a length behind
The Night Patrol, who had gone to the front. From
the five-furlong post, Manfred and the Governor’s
horse, who had the rails, raced together with not
more than half a length between them, although
Young on The Night Patrol tried hard to get a
break. Neither had an advantage as they turned into
the straight, and it was a wonderful race all the
way to the winning post, but the colt, going a little
the better at the finish, got there by a short head,
with Pantheon, who made up a lot of ground, three
lengths away third, Royal Charter, Valamita and
Hampden following in that order, it was the most
thrilling race of the season in Melbourne. The time,
lmin. 57sec., was a course record' for 94 furlongs.
There were 17 starters for the Moonee Valley Cup,
and at the outset of the betting McShortodds, being
in a wonderfullv generous mood, called 8 to 1 the field.
Smoke Bomb, from Holt’s stable, wound up favorite
at s’s, with Tookarby at 7’s, Lemina B’s, Susie Pye,
llaith and Stralia 10’s, Friarsdale and Wallarak 12’s
and the others 14’s to 50’s. Susie Pye and King
of Mirth were in the van early, but Friarsdale took
the lead about six furlongs from home, only to be
headed by Raith at the turn. Raith looked like
winning easily, but Tookarby came with a great run
in the straight and passed the post a length and a
half clear of him, with Friarsdale a moderate third.
All Sunshine was fourth, and Stralia, Our Prince and
Accarak were the best of the others. Tookarby, who
carried Bst. lib., a pound more than his handicap
weight, is trained by Dave Price for “M. Denis”
and F. W. Kitchen and was ridden by George Harri-
son. He ran the 111 furlongs in 2min. 27sec.
lianooka (7 to 4), the A.J.C. Gimerack Stakes
winner, carried her fist. 31b. stoutly in the fillies’
division of the St. Albans Handicap and won
nicely from the unlucky Duchess of Blankney (4’s).
with Melitha (7 to 2) third. She galloped the four
furlongs in 49jsee., half a second better than the
12-to-l shot Bylaw (Bucklaw —Rangare) took to
win the colts’ division of the same race. There was
a plunge on Vagrant (4’s), from the unlucky Barlow
stable, in the Welter, but Abdera (10’s) beat the
supposed good thing by a neck, with Kaolin (12’s)
third. Red Gauntlet (s’s) ran well in this race, and
Chatterbox was also prominent in the early part, but
Flemington should suit them better.
“Hamer”: Kanooka’s race at the Valiev still
further lifts the amount of stakes which Robert" Miller
has collected from the victories of his four good
horses. Windbag, with his 12 wins, has picked
up over £15,0u0 in stakes; Boaster, with three
wins as a three-year-old and his Epsom dead-heat,
has earned £4000; Chatterbox, who in her 19
starts has had 12 placings, six of them firsts, has
won £2OOO, and Kanooka, whose win in the
Gimcrack Stakes was worth £l7OO, now goes up to
near the same amount. And they were not expensive
yearlings any of them. Windbag, the daddy of
the lot, cost his lucky owner only 150 guineas.
If Manfred gets away with his opponents,
or even a few lengths behind them, he should place
another Derby to Ben Chaffey’s credit at Flemington
on Saturday; but this page cannot recommend him
for the Melbourne Cup, in which, win or lose the
Derby, he will carry 7st. 81b. He is doubtless a
good colt and game, but the fact remains that he
has dwelt at the barrier in four of his last eight
races; also his narrow defeat of The Eight Patrol
at w.f.a. is nothing to rave over, especially as
Pantheon gained six or seven lengths on the pair in
the last half-mile. Windbag looks a much more
trustworthy candidate. Certainly 9st. 21b. is a
substantial burden for a four-year-old, but Lord
Cardigan had 41b. more when he ran second to
Acrasia (7st. 61b ) in 1904, and Rivoli only lib.
less when he chased Bitalli (7st.) home in 1923.
And Bitalli was an exceptionally good lightweight,
Whereas few Sydney observers w'ould rate Rivoli
equal to Windbag. The latter is handy in a field,
brilliant enough to work into a good position early
and capable of staying for a week. Pilliewinkie
should get a place, and may win if anything happens
to Windbag. Eight stone thirteen will be a.
luxury for Samuel Hordern’s horse after the weights
he has been humping in Sydney, and the distance
Vvill also be congenial—he won the Trentham Cup
at Wellington (M.L.) last March with 9st. 41b. up,
and ran the two miles in 3min. 26|sec. Others
well in the market are Spearfelt (9st.), Stand By
(9st. 51b.), Frances Tressady (Bst. 61b.), Raith
(6st. 71b.) and Ro.val Charter (Bst 21b.), and per-
haps Raith is destined to earn a bit more place
money for E. A. Underwood.
Rampion easily defeated Kanooka in a trial at
Flemington the other day, and ran the five furlongs
in lmin. lsec. On that effort and his Sydney
form he should prove too good for the other young-
ster. 4 in the Maribrynong Plate. The Cantala Stakes
may go,to Baldwin (Bst. 31b.) or one of the Kelso
pair. Boaster (Bst. 61b.) and Chatterbox (7st. 91b. ).
The little mare is a good place bet, as she is
very lightly weighted on her Sydney running and
is as game as they make them.
HE HAD THE GIFT.
BILL (who has had a had day): “Think I'll try an’ yet a
job with one of the papers as a tipster. Before a race
I always know wot’s goin ’ t’ win, and afterwards w’y it
didn’t.”
Hit's fine form in the October Handicap,
11 furlongs, at Warwick Farm on Saturday suggests
that he was unlucky to lose the City Tattersall’s
Handicap at Randwick on October 17. In that
race he was badly interfered with, but he was
always with the leaders at the Farm and had the
others settled a long way from home; time, 2min.
20sec. The erratic Varney was favorite at 4’s;
Hit, Gulgong (third) and Purest, who remained
at the post, w r ere at s’s, Lady Lizzie (fourth) 6’s
and Polynesian 10’s. The last-named beat all but
Hit; he has been running generously in recent
races, and his painstaking trainer should presently
get his reward.
“Topee” ; After an argument between two
friends as to the amount possible to be won by
backing each winning horse and puttihg the gains
as they accumulated on the next (“all up”), I
totted up what a visit to Warwick Farm would have
produced, starting with 10s. The figures were £2,
£l2, £56, £336, £2352 and £25,872. Some-
what surprised, I then tried Ascot, same date, with
13 events. Although there was only £llB4 in
the mythical bag in the sixth race, long prices
brought this up to £373,880 at the ninth. Then
things started to move. The tenth was a dead-heat,
both winners at 25 to 1, so that at half odds the
five-million mark was passed. Prices were shorter
for the remaining three events, but the total reached
£110,428,640. Getting interested, I went further
and found that if my horse, instead of dead-heating,
had won straight out at his s.p., the Tribes would
have been done in for £210,654,527 10s. As a
million sovs. weighs something over seven tons, if
paid in gold, I should have been at the expense of
half a dozen goods trains to bring the boodle from
the course. Anyhow, Mo (if he survived, which
is doubtful) could boast of laying a good price
for once in his life.
"Bris”: There must be a lot of absent-
minded punters in Queensland. A return prepared
for the Attorney-General shows that during last
financial year £-2608 16s. was unclaimed when the
tote closed; £722 9s. of this was subsequently
claimed and paid at the Justice Department, the
balance being paid into consolidated revenue. In
addition to unclaimed dividends, the Government gets
the benefit of all fractional money not paid by the
tote; this amounted to £16,326 last year. The
totalisator tax (5 per cent, on turnover) brought in
£48,588; so altogether the tote was worth £66,800
to the Government. Bookmakers paid £BO4B in
license fees, which range from £5O a year in the
paddock to £5 on the flat. The tax on betting
tickets (3d. in the paddock ; Id. elsewhere) produced
£21,290, and similar taxes on “nod” bets added
£4llB to the revenue. Total revenue from racing
for the year; £100,257 18s. lid.

Fours from Maoriland, Westralia, Queens-
land and the Speck competed for the Stewards’ Chal-
lenge Cup at Henley-on-the-Yarra, and they all proved
too good for the Victorian crews, who were eliminated
in the heats. The brightest contest of the day was
in the semi-final, in which the Westralians, stroked
bv the veteran George Rogers, disposed of Hamilton
(M.L.). The Maorilanders looked sur.e winners at one
stage, but the men from Swan River weighed in
with a great final effort and won by inches. They
had a much less uncomfortable time in the final
against Rockhampton (Q.), Westralia having the race
well in hand from start to finish. The Mercantile
crews, which have had 22 Henley wins to their
credit (the next best is Albert Park’s 13), were out
of the hunt in the Maiden Fours and Maiden Fights,
both of which went to Mildura crews, the first scoring
from South Melbourne and Sandhurst and the second
from University and the Banks. The Yarra Challenge
Cup, for scullers, was easy for Cambridge, of-Sand-
hurst. The Junior Eights went to Albert Park ; but
in the Senior Eights the Essendon combination staved
off a challenge by the mud-pounders and won com-
fortably.
“Hasen" : The horses
hadn’t yet come out for
the Plate at Albion Park
(Brisbane), but alcohol
had evidently hurled him
into a world of his own as
he sat, with closed eyes
and nodding head, on the
back of a bookmaker’s
stand. From his mutter-
ings it was soon plain that
the race was already being
run in vivid detail, before
his tightly-shut eyes.
“Gorraway all ri’,” he said
thickly. “YVadid I tell
y’ ? Lady L-l-l-rona well
out in front. ’Course, she
is. Never see whish way
she went. Look ’t her.
Never see” Then he
paused as if listening to
the comment of a doubtful
neighbor. “Ca’ch her?
R-r-ratsh! ” he answered
some unspoken criticism
fiercely. “Look ’t her.
They won’ ca’ch her. Lady
L-l-l-rona ’ll win by a
street: five streetsh. Ca’ch
her! Huh!” A little later;
with the imaginary field
thundering up a visionary
straight, he waved one arm
feebly and soggily and
cried “Lady L-l-rona!
Lady ’rona !” over and over
in a stertorous crescendo.
Evidently with success, tor
he slapped the empty air
boisterously on the back
and said. “Wadid I tell
y’ ? Won by a minute!”
And then, very firmly, “No,
norranother bet. Only came
down f’r Lady L-l-l-rona.
Now I’m... .goinome.”
And he rose and made as
straight as might be for
the gate, a well-satisfied
winner 10 minutes before
the race was run and an
unfeeling judge placed
Lady Lurona third.
*
Motor-boat enthusiasts arc wondering
whether the race for the championship at Brisbane
next Saturday will be free from the mishaps which
have marred it in previous years. McWilliams will
defend with Century Tire, the winner last year, and
the Rymills have brought their Tortoise 11. from
Adelaide. Both boats have 450-h.p. Liberty engines.
Whatmore’s Gee Whiz, which is built on much the
same lines as the Tortoise, will also be in the
field.
* * * *
Eddie Parker, the Maoriland middleweight,
was overwhelmed by a black cloud of disaster, called
“Tiger” Payne, at the Rushcutter Bay Stadium on
Saturday night. It was a desperate and sanguinary
fight, and both combatants had to be sewn together
afterwards. The coon, who scaled list. 61b., a
few ounces more than the white man, and who was
making his first appearance since his arrival from
America a month ago. laid the Maorilander’s scalp
open in the second round by means of a judicious
bump with his ivory dome, the gash bleeding con-
tinually thereafter. He also floored Parker in the
same session. But the paleface showed great pluck,
and was well ahead on points until half-way through
the 13th, when “Tiger,” swinging furiously, contrived
to hang a particularly dirty right on the point of
Eddie’s chin. Parker took nine seconds and arose
to be flattened for the full count, only a couple of
seconds before the bell would have rung.
Ignacio Fernandez (Bst. 9|lb.) made a
chopping block of Dick Congress (Bst. 9jlb.) at
the Melbourne Stadium. The wonder is that the
bashed and battered Victorian lasted out the 20
rounds ; he looked dead to the world at the end of the
sixth, thanks to a vicious right which caught him
just before the gong. For his endurance and plucky
enterprise when obviously outclassed, Congress was
given an ovation. He succeeded in making the
fight interesting to the end. Hooking as venomous as
a tiger-cat, with his eyes flashing threats, Fernandez
waited for Congress as the latter came in with in-
tentions of committing grievous bodily harm, and
the Filipino invariably got in first with vicious knocks
that made the Victorian’s face like a picture no
artist can paint. Congress often looked about to
become a cot case, but somehow his brown opponent
was unable to land a blow which might have saved
much gore. That lie therein failed is a point against
the lithe Ignacio, who showed an inclination to slow
up when he should have been busiest.
“O. McKay M.” : Many young men promi-
nent in various branches of sport in Victoria were
officially patted on the back when Melbourne Uni.
Sports Council made its annual award of blues and
half-blues. Dr. J. R. Ha.skor was given his double-
blue in cricket and football for the third successive
year, and I. J. Wood also earned a double (cricket
and hockey). Among the lawn-tennis blues are
lan Mclnnes, now a full-fledged medico; R. Coldham,
Australian junior singles champion ; J. B. Turner and
Paul Haege. Members of the ’Varsity team have
held the Vic. under-2l championship since 1920;
Mclnnes won in 1921 and 1922, Turner in 1923
and 1924, and Haege this year. A surprise was the
award of only a half-blue to R. H. lieon-Cohen,
twice stroke of the ’Varsity crew and stroke of the
eight which won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley
last year. K. Schneider, who has played inter-State
cricket, got a half-blue in football. There were 93
awards altogether, 51 of them full-blues.
* * * *
“Matahari”: Central Cumberland knocked
up 452 in 3j hours against Northern Districts on
Saturday. The innings was quite exhilarating, and
took one back to days when brisk scoring was the
rule in Sydney premiership cricket and not the rare
exhibition it is to-day. I recall the effort of Victor
Trumper and Dan Gee, for Paddington v. Redfern, in
1903: 423 in 2hr. 40min. Trumper’s share was 335.
The same Trumper got 50 in 9min. v. Waverley in
1907, and 272 (with Bubb) v. Mt. Morgan in 80min.
Shall wc ever look upon his like again?
* * * *
“O.O.B.”: If a comic history of Victorian
cricket is ever written, Charlie Over, just dead at 60,
will have a chapter to himself. Charlie joined the
Melbourne C. G. staff over 30 years ago. He was
then Vic.’s crack baseball pitcher, and in that capacity
toured America with the Australian baseball team
in 1897. On the cricket field he was a good bat, and
a capital slow bowler. Practically all the celebrities
who had a knock at the Melbourne nets favored
Charlie’s pitch, and a diamond tiepin from the Karl
of Dudley—“my souvy from Dud” —-was a treasured
possession. When a relative left him a legacy his
remark was characteristic. “I knoo I’d get it,” he
explained gravely. “1 was the next of skin.”
* * * -*
“Ilamer”: The solemnity of ericket in
Melbourne has been disturbed thus early in this
season by barraekers showing an inclination to treat
the game as if it were football. In the course
of the Fitzroy-Richmond match police had to be
called in to remonstrate with boisterous spirits. So
far from the cricketers being flattered by this un-
wonted show of interest, the V.C.A. has had its
attention drawn to it, with a request for action.
Last season an out-fielder who had dropped a catch in
a district match was so annoyed at the remarks made
by one particular barracker that he leapt the fence
and hit the offender hard on the nose. But really,
if they want the public to be interested in the
game, cricketers should not be too thin-skinned. Some-
times in Melbourne, w'here “digging-in” has become
a fine art, the voice of the barracker is the only
bright thing in an afternoon’s cricket.
* * * *
“Wink”: 11. Baring- (North Melb.) and
Garland (University) are two Melbourne colts who
manage to keep a family name in big print. Last
season Baring, then just 16, was several times among
the pennant top-scorers, and this year he has started
with a well-made 90. His brother Fred was a
Shield man for many years and the State’s best bad-
wicket bat. Young Garland, now 18, inherits his
bowling ability from his dad (years ago a good slow
bowler with North Melb.), and in his first pennant
game had the best record in the competition. He
has all the stock tricks and never “telegraphs” his
intentions.
* * * *
S.A. Cricket Association at its annual
meeting reappointed Harold Fisher as president, con-
ferred life memberships on B. V. Scrymgour, treasurer
for many years, and Mrs. Mostyn Evan, widow of
the late president, and made Harry Blinman a
trustee to replace Evan—the other trustees are
bcrymgour and John Hill. The annual report
recorded a new members’ stand at a cost of £B5OO,
and the new step of terracing the mounds also. It
also expressed a modest hope that S.A. will soon
get back to its old place in cricket, after last
seasons wins against N.S.W. (a weakened team,
however) and England.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: Tlierc is an interesting personal
touch about the great W. G. Grace in a new English
book of cricket reminiscences. One who played with
him regularly says that lie was never heard, as
captain, setting down the batting order, to use the
ordinary expression “go in.” He always said “you
will come in”—third or seventh wicket down or
whatever it might be. That is, always going in
first himself, he quite unconsciously took it for
gianted that he would be still at the wicket when
the turn of whoever it was arrived.
* * * *
“Hamer”: A statistical friend lias esti-
mated that E. J. Lewis, of the Melbourne Bowling
Club, has trundled bowls over 20,000 miles during
his career; he has taken an active part in the
game for 57 years. And Lewis has another claim
upon the reverence of bowlers. His father was the
founder of the first bowling club in Melbourne.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It is estimated that 20,000 ‘unfit’ eggs, several
tons of pease-meal, flour, soot, ochre, bad herrings
and cods’ heads were utilised by Glasgow University
students in the traditional horse-play at the polling
booths which precedes the election of a Lord Hector.
ln the hand-to-hand encounters some of the
students took off their boots and hurled them at
their opponents. Many were injured and one admitted
to hospital. It will take two days to clear away
the garbage.”
Sport of various kinds entices by the banks of Cam
and Isis,
But how tame and flat, it cannot be denied,
Is the ordered hugger-mugger of your soccer and your
rugger
Compared with our amusements by the Clyde.
Cricket, tennis, golf and rowing, weight-propelling,
hammer-throwing,
May content your gentle undergraduate souls,
But when academic Rectors press their claims on our
electors
There is sport a bit more stirring at the polls.
Chaps, has nothing been forgotten? Are the eggs
supremely rotten?
Are the soot and 0( lire ready for the fray ?
Hear the noisome herrings humming to proclaim the
foe is coming!
Sniff the piercing reek of cod-heads in decay'!
Are your bluchers hard and heavy, toll on rival heads
to levy
When the hand-in-hand engagements shall begin,
And Achilles picks his Hector ? Come along, we’ll
choose a Rector.
Brothers, stiffen up your muscles and fall in !
German students think they’re sensing sport’s allure-
ments at their fencing;
Yale and Harvard deem their football dangerous ;
Though these kid-glove recreations may suffice for
other nations
They hold no ginger and no snap for us.
Comrades, is your ammunition fairly in decomposi-
tion ?
Is it ripe and rank enough to spread dismay?
Every man, then, to his sector! For we’ve got to
choose a Rector
In the good old snorting, sporting Glasgow wry.

A little co. of 10,000 £1 shares is being floated
by the Liberal party in South Aus. to put its organ
on a sound footing as a weekly Liberal Leader.
The provisional directors are local politicians of
weight—W. A. Hamilton, Prosser, David Gordon,
Henry Tassie and Hudd —with William Page, of the
Liberal Club, as secretary. There are to be “abso-
lutely no free shares.”
“Ricardo”: It’s an ill wind, etc. One effect of the
British seamen’s strike has been to hold up ship-
ments of the English comics and penny dreadfuls,
and many kiddies are wailing because they can’t
follow the adventures of Tiger Tim. Harry Hippo
and other inflictions. A marine dislocation that
would .shut out the Hollywood atrocities would have
an even brighter side to it.
“Quiz”: Established in 1874 by A. T. Clark, who
represented Williamstown in the State Parliament
for 10 years, the Williamstown Advertiser recently
changed hands for the first time. Clark died 25 years
ago. During most of its life the paper has been
practically controlled by “Joe” Curtain, a part-
proprietor, who started life on the Geelong Advertiser
nearly half a century ago. He is forsaking the
Inky Way.
A writer in London Daily Chronicle (18/8/’25)
calls attention to one of the 113,000 graves in St.
Mary’s Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, which is
in such a deplorably neglected condition that it is
hardly possible to read on the dilapidated headstone:
“Pray for the soul of
Philip William May
(Phil May)
Who died sth August. 1903, aged 39.
Requiescat.”
And “it costs only 265. a year,” explained a cemetery
official, “to keep a grave planted with flowers.”
“Alwyn”: On October 21, 1817, that remarkable
old-timer the Rev. Sam Marsden successfully insti->
tuted the first criminal-libel action in Australia
against J. T. Campbell, Governor Macquarie’s secre-
tary. The action arose out of a letter attacking the
parson under the signature of “Philo Free” which
appeared in the Sydney Gazette of January 4, 1817.
On securing a verdict, Marsden, who was merely
desirous of vindicating his honor, didn’t press for
damages. But a remarkable account of the trial,
appearing in the Gazette of November 1, 1817, so
enraged him that he immediately instituted civil
proceedings. The case was re-tried by the Supreme
Court on December 1, 1817, a verdict being entered
for the plaintiff for £2OO. The two trials cost
Campbell £476.
Dear Bulletin, —At 87 my grip is still tight on
two very dilapidated copies of the St. Leonards
Weekly Times, one copy dated January 16, 1858;
the other April 19 of the same year. I was one of
the youngsters who ran it; my partner in the crime
was W. G. Lenthall. The type (old battered-faced
pica) was set up in a little portable office near Blue’s
Point, and the formes ferried across Sydney harbor
and worked off on Robert Barr’s big platen machine,
considered a press greyhound for speed. Bell's
Life, then the only sporting paper in Sydney, in
noticing the birth of the infant, referred to it as
“a homoeopathic dose of mushroom literature, not big
enough to enwrap a pound of sausages.” This un-
complimentary criticism served to uncork the fledgling
journalists’ vials of wrath, and we hit back by
denouncing Bell's Life as “a pestiferous, poisonous,
obnoxious, infernal, lying, dirty dishclout, only fit to
be taken to the fire by a pair of tongs.” The end
of our little “mag” was very tragic. Ben Barnett,
the waterman, who was conveying its formes across
the harbor, had his boat capsized in a sudden squall,
and of course the formes found sepulture in the
mud of Port Jackson. So disappeared our type, and
the Weekly Times was never resurrected. —P. Jeff
Wallace.

Ordering a musical comedy from U.S.A.
these days must be like requisitioning for
a Ford; there are likely to be few surprises
when the packet is opened up. “Leave It
to Jane,” the musical comedy which was in-
troduced to Sydney and the new G.-G. on
Saturday at Her Majesty’s, was launched in
191-7, and in the interval between its first
appearance in the Land of Liberty and its
importation here some of its gags have cir-
cumnavigated the globe many times. The
accompanying din, however, includes lest?
jazz and more melody than there is
in some of its successors; and many
of the lays are distinctly catching.
“The Crickets Are Calling,” sung by
Genevieve Davis and Cecil Scott, and
“What Do You Do Sunday, Mary?” by
Maude Fane and Leyland Hodgson, will soon
be exercising suburban pianos. The plot,
which unfolds itself too slowly in the first
act but gathers momentum later, concerns
the rivalry of two colleges—the hobbies of
millionaires—in the exercise of that strenu-
ous butchery which passes for football in
U.S.A. The necessity for tempting Billy
Bolton, a noted half-back (played in poor
style by Cecil Scott), from one school to
the other, gives Jane Witherspoon (Gene-
vieve Davis) exercise in love-making, of
which she takes moderate advantage; and
Leyland Hodgson, as another lover, imparts
“LEAVE IT TO JANE,” AT SYDNEY
MAJESTY’S.
Athol Tier (“Isn’t he like the Prince of
Wales?”) as a comedian, and Winnie
Collins as a prominent waitress.
humor and sentiment to his part in alter-
nate doses which Maude Fane accepts in
the spirit in which they are given. Athol
Tier, late of the Tivoli, made a first appear-
ance with the Firm as a tall, thin streak of
languid buffoonery with all the ghastly beauty
of a puppet in the Javanese shadow-show.
His characterisation of “Bub” Hicks, a
freshman, was a masterpiece of fantastic
fooling, in which he was ably assisted by
Winnie Collins’s pert humor and tasteful
grin. Cecil Kellaway and Harry Wotton
were, as usual, adequate; and Reita Nugent
danced in a muscular way and as if she
liked it.
❖* * *
“The Great Lover” of Maurice Mosco-
vitch, who returned to Sydney Criterion on
Saturday, differs fundamentally from the
philanderer of Louis Bennison, who first in-
troduced the part to Australia three years
ago. The new exponent added breadth,
depth and variety to the part of the elderly
Italian baritone who loses his voice before
he loses his capacity to get entangled in the
silken nets cast by the pursuing sex. Ben-
nison’s Paurel was an exhibition of phy-
sical coxcombry which failed to carry con-
viction. The new man’s was in a subtle
and intellectual vein which made comic tra-
gedy of the final incident, wherein the curtain
descends on the fallen Don Juan of two con-
tinents making the best of it over the tele-
phone with an exceedingly commonplace
American inamorata infected with the
giggles.
* * * *
The principal’s ornate display did not over-
shadow Jean Robertson’s quiet portrayal of
the simple New York soprano, which was
well in place. Nat Madison, Moscoviteli’s
son, as Carlo Sonnino, the hero’s under-
study, supplied a bright gem of unaffected
acting; and Eileen Sparkes made a late but
spirited entrance as his mother. G. Kay
Souper struggled with the mob of raving
artists in a somewhat stilted manner, and
H. Mackenzie-Rogan, as medical adviser to
the star threatened with loss of voice,
scarcely earned his fees. Into the part of
Giulia Sabattini, Italian prima donna, Marie
Eaton put plenty of imported foreign fire,
and Arthur Greenaway, as valet to the hero,
gave satisfaction. In marked contrast to
the temperamental fireworks of a cast of
imitation Italian and German prima donnas,
tenors and bassos buffe was the gross, sad
and heavy Signor Sparapani of Lubia Bar-
bares. It was obviously the genuine article.

Hilders of the dawn:—
Although the catalogue depicts a sturdy cherub
brandishing a flaming torch, the Younger Group of
Australian Artists, in its second annual show at
Horderns’, Sydney, flings no challenge in the whiskers
of the elder generation, but is content to plough
a furrow already turned. This is just as well, since
youth alone does not give the key to the fortress
of technique which even geniuses spend a lifetime
in assailing.
The outlook of the new schools is taken only
by a couple of contributors. Roland Wakelin has
a “Landscape with Horse,” as barren as its title;
and G, Cossington Smith has a shorthand transcript
of a civic reception which is as laconic and truthful
as the newspaper reports of such functions are verbose
and fraudulent. Isabel. Huntley sticks a jaundiced
little girl somewhat precariously to a sward rather
biliously green in No. 5; and in No. 46 Grace
Crowley poses two models in the buff and one merci-
fully clothed. Another figure study in the same
studio vein is No. 41, “The Story,” by H. C. Gibbons,
in which the nude man about to sneeze is better
drawn than painted. The same artist has a nice
landscape in No. 43, in which the sunlight streaming
through a basket-willow’s foliage is pleasingly cor-
related with the lines of shadow on the hill behind.
Norman Lloyd has rich, bland views of Sydney
Harbor and other beauty spots, but in No. 17 his
Allvn River contradicts the atlases by disappearing
underground. Another, trader in expensive fabrics is
11. R. Gallop, who in No. 106, an extended picture
of industry on the Parramatta, shows he can cover
a wide acreage as well. F. Y. Lahey strikes a
lightsome note in all his canvases, particularly in
his studies of the noble art of hop-picking. Dorrit
Black progresses quietly; No. 131 is a dreamy land-
scape with a curious romantic charm.
The soundest work, and well above the level of
the older art societies, is to be found amongst the
black and white, where Adrian Feint has some Aubrey
Beardsley decorations,, No. 156, “Morning,” being
| particularly nimble. Roy Davies has a striking
woodcut in No. 165, “The Idealogue,” appropriately
one-e.yed; and Unk White does such fine gymnastics
with his clean and dexterous line that one prophesies
great things for him when he comes down off the
trapeze. Eileen McGrath sends a quaint picture of
Henry Lawson boiling his billy surrounded by phan-
tom long-beers disguised as angels; and E. da Costa
shows talent with some fairies.
Frank Lynch comes forward with a cheeky statuette
of Cleopatra submitting ecstatically to the osculation
of the asp. The well-modelled lady has light upper-
works but leggy understandings; and whether her
prototype ever trod the sands of Egypt, she may
be seen any sunny day on the sands of Manly.
* $ * *
A show from Overseas:—
Like an R.A. show without the duchesses is the
exhibition of the Royal British Colonial Society of
Artists, now open at Farmer’s, Sydney. Sid Long,
with a romantic Hawkesbury landscape, is the only
“colonial” this Page identified; the rest are sound.
British Fred Hall’s draught horses drink-
ing out of the village pond; Fred Roe’s and Hathe-
rell’s genre pictures; E. A. Homel’s flowery arbors
and florid, girls; Arthur Wardle’s polar bears and a
Lavery seascape illuminated by artificial light—-these
represent a school of artists dogged by the knowledge
that if they move off, the track on which they made
their first successful step they will be lost in the
jungle of oblivion. There arc, besides, a sensational
Orpen depicting a pea-green soldier eating a pea-
green French girl while a pea-green comrade sprawls
indifferently on the ground against a backcloth torn
by searchlights; a Sargent water-color guarded like
the Mona Lisa in the Louvre and insured for £ 1000 ;
a Brangwyn bridge; a beautiful old woman etched by
Malcolm Osborne. Something may be learned about
the water-color mystery from Talbot Kelly and the
decorative Moffat Lindner; about horseflesh from
Lucy Kemp-Welch and of the pastel art from William
Hoggatt; but the vast bulk of the exhibit is likely
to be of most interest to the enterprising manufacturer
of artistic chocolate boxes on the look-out for new
ideas.
“THE BAD MAN,” AT SYDNEY ROYAL.
Guy Bates Post as Pancho Lopez (a Mexi-
can bandit) and Pedro (Ashton Jarry).
“The Street Singer” was introduced to
Melbourne at the Theatre Royal on Satur-
day night by a Gladys Moncrieff who has
slimmed remarkably, and was given num-
erous opportunities to display a robust
voice. It took four people to construct a
play which is not an extraordinary master-
piece, but has a story and good trimmings ;
Frederick Lonsdale provided a “book” with-
out the cheap gags which prevail in Ameri-
can comedies, and Percy Greenbank sup-
plied the lyrics, H. Fraser-Simson bright
and tuneful music, and Ivy St. I-lelier some
interpolated numbers. The street singer,
Yvette, makes her way into the studio of
the artist Bonni, who, in the course of paint-
ing her portrait, falls in love with her, to
the annoyance of his previous model, Marie;
but later, flattered by the notice taken of
Lis work by a duchess-, the artist shows every
likelihood of allowing his susceptible soul
to be captured by a new flame. The duchess
turns out to be Yvette, who adopted the dis-
guise of the street singer to help the strug-
gling artist, and sent the invitation to him
to test his affection; but, overhearing a con-
versation between Armand and Bonni, she
decides that her lover is not as fickle as he
appeared, and the usual happiness comes at
the finish.
* * * *
Although lacking some of the tenderness
obviously intended to be shown by Yvette,
Gladys Moncrieff sang engagingly, and made
a dazzling and impressive appearance as the
duchess. Noel Leyland was moderately effec-
tive as the artist Bonni; Claude Flemming
did good work as Armand, the friend who
tries to twist the love-story in his own direc-
tion.; and Arthur Stigant, as Frangois, and
Leslie Holland, as Levy, served up comedy
in good measure. Bryl Walkely, as the
model, Marie, had a part which suited her;
and. amongst the others, Nellie Payne, as
Yiolette, added to the brightness of the per-
formance.
** * *
A big crowd cheered Beresford Fowler in
his new venture into Ibsen with “Hedda
Gabler” at Melbourne Queen’s. The story
of the annoying woman who would have
been better shot in the first act than the
last was somewhat beyond the capacity of
the company, who missed the dialogue’s finer
points. Beresford Fowler was himself less
well placed than usual as Eilert Lovborg, and
Claude Thomas as George Tesman provided
a sufficient explanation for the neurotic
ennui of his wife. Through that part Ruby
May bored her way conscientiously but mon-
otonously, and Gwen Apted, though occa-
sionally good, was too emotional. Mostyn
Wright made a stodgy Judge Brack, but
Ethel Adele (Mrs. Fowler) was a good aunt
Julia. “Rutherford and Son” is the fare
to-night, Shaw’s “Candida” on Saturday
and Ibsen’s “Ghosts” on Wednesday next.
Gup visitors who have not previously
seen it will have an opportunity of viewing
“No, No, Nanette,” and then it ends as far
as Melbourne is concerned. “Archie” will
follow at the New Princess.
“Wildflower” blooms* at His Majesty’s,
Melbourne, as though it were an everlasting.
The story of how two stay-at-home spouses
mixed tlieir drinks and felt all the worse for
it in the morning continues to be unfolded
to the amusement of Melbourne at the
King’s, where the weather-report says it's
still “Fair and Warmer.”
At Melbourne Athenaeum Harry Green
and “Mo”—Roy Rene —in their curiously
contrasted styles, keep up a lire of mirth in
“Give and Take” and ring the bell at every
shot.
On Friday of next week “Charley's
Aunt” will retire on the wealth she. has
brought the management; and “The Private
Secretary” is already booking orders for
seats at the New Palace.
The elephants and other details (if an
elephant can be described as a detail) of
Wirths’ Circus continue to draw the crowd to
Olympia; but the Melbourne season ends
on November 9.
“Abraham Lincoln,” which was to have
been produced at the Playhouse by the Re-
pertory Players on Melbourne Cup night,
has been postponed. The first of seven per-
formances is to take place on Saturday,
November 7. It will be the last production
in the Playhouse, which is thereafter to be
transformed into a cabaret and supper-place.
Clement May, recently at the Tivoli, re-
leased a party of Dickens characters at the
Melbourne Playhouse last week, and proved
himself capable of entertaining Dickens
lovers for a whole evening. He inclines to
make his sketches melodramatic, but he suc-
ceeded in giving character to many well-
known identities, Wilkins Micawber being
possibly his best; his quick make-up was
always excellent. Stanley Brookes helped
him with a couple of sketches. Lorn a Reid,
entertainer at the piano; soprano Thelma
Neill and baritone E. J. Wood provided
musical embellishments.
Australian films are getting a good look-in
this week in Melbourne picture houses.
Louise Lovely’s “Jewelled Nights,” which is
from a somewhat exotic book by Marie
Boelke-Peterson, holds the fort at Hoyt’s
De Luxe, with a Hoot Gibson quick-movement
story, “Taming the West,” in support; and
at the Majestic “The Busihwhackerfc” is
screened. Neither is as typically Australian,
in regard to plot, as it might be, but both

are good enough to show that Australia can
produce pictures above the average of those
pushed upon Australians by importers.
“Wives” is the Majestic second string—a
feature which seems to suggest that wives
are a nuisance.
❖* ❖ *
At Melbourne Tivoli Maurice Diamond’s
girl-show is at the head of the bill; the
shapely crowd sparkles all through an ener-
getic turn. Marie Lawton, with her harp,
is back again, as pleasing as before; and a
newcomer, Willie Woltard, does eccentric
things with hats. Another turn which stirs
some applause is that of the Romano Broth-
ers, “gladiatorial exponents.”

The 19/60-H.P. CROSSLEY
THE 19/60-li.p. Crossley has probably
attracted more attention than any other
car in its class. Certainly it possesses a
very enviable reputation for all-round efficiency
and sweetness of running, and is recognised as
being a delightful car to handle. 1 rom me
miles per hour on top gear it can be rapidly
accelerated to sixty. Everything about the cai
speaks of quality, and its road performance
satisfies the most exacting.
Further, the fact that the 19/60-h.p. Cioss-
ley broke all R.A.C. Certified Trial Car Mileage
Records when it completed 25,000 miles under
the observation of the Royal Automobile Club
supplies ample and conclusive proof ot extra-
ordinary reliability. No other car has evei
approached this distance under official observa-
tion. The Crossley completed 25,000 miles with
only 31 minutes spent on adjustments or repairs
on the” road, and at a total cost we have calcu-
lated to be ljd. per mile for oil, fuel and tyres
Full details of this achievement gladly supplied
011 Tmusu!; emphasised that the 19/60-li p.
Crossley is a car far above the ordinary, witn
all the refinements which appeal to the experi-
enced motorist. Built from the finest material
obtainable and with scrupulous care, it is a car
which can be purchased with confidence, and
which will live up to the splendid reputation it
has gained in every part of the world. Petioj
consumption results are better than those ot any
other car of similar capacity.
The 19 /60-h.p. Crossley was the hi st
British car to run from Adelaide to Darwin and
back under its own power. The car used had
nreviously run over 30,000 miles.
There are numerous 19/60-h.p. Crossleys on
the road to-day which have already completed
over 150,000 miles, and are still running as
sweetly as ever.

The Woman’s Example.
Australia could not get on without the example and teaching of its
women.
When times are bad it is the woman who cheers her husband, it is the
woman who keeps the home going by her adaptable common sense, by her
spirit and her power to encourage her husband and sons. And it is the
woman who most conscientiously practises thrift, for every good housewife
is thrifty, many from necessity, some from experience and all from the
knowledge that theirs is the spending end and upon their wise restraint
depends the welfare of the home and the realisation of ambitions.
For every woman, man and child in Australia there is a Savings Bank
Service, extending through Post Offices to every part of the Commonwealth.
Commonwealth lank of Australia.

And at Burrowa Street, Young, N.S.W.
A light, tuneful soprano was aired by Miss
Maisie Owen at Melbourne's austere Assem-
bly Hall when, in conjunction with baritone
James Scott, she gave a concert. A Brahms
“Lullaby” was sung by the lady with a sweet-
ness which earned vociferous applause. Mr.
Scott, whose method is rather monotonous,
did best in Flegier’s “The Horn. ’
Viewed again ' last week, the Optimists
Revue Company, with a new box of tricks
at Melbourne Bijou, made a better impres-
sion. The vivacious Nell Fleming is the
spirit of the show, and with Ena Gordon
tickled the audience in two or three fresh
numbers.
Melbourne’s Art Blooming :
As usual, there is a riot of poor stuff in the Art
Society’s show in Albert-street; but a search among
the rubbish has its rewards. John Longstaff, in the
portrait section, has a lively impression of Miss
Edna Thomas, and his Maurice Moscovitch will
stand amongst the best work he has done; there is
great delicacy also in his portrait of Mrs. Henry
Thompson. Miss Marion Jones’s portrait of Lord
Novar is a poor thing, which needs its label; and
a painting of Mr. Thomas Townend by James Quinn
also lacks quality.
“Badinage,” by Bernard Hall, is conceived in a
lively spirit and executed in the same way; Carl
Hampel has a convincing “Incoming Tide, Narra-
been,” and several landscapes by John Rowell main-
tain a good average with a slight weakness in color.
Will Rowell has an agreeable “ ’Neath the Pines,”
and “Forty Winks” is also a fine study; and Victor
Zelman shows moderate work. Dora Wilson is best
represented by a flower study; E. Buckmaster’s “The
Hayshed” is commonplace, and there is some fair
but undistinguished work by Lindsay Tonkin. A.
E. Walcott, J. Beament, C. F. Mudie and W. Dela-
field Cook.
The work of Harold Herbert and George Benson is
outstanding amongst the water-colorists, although
Carlyle Jackson and R. W. Sturgess also attract.
Jessie Traill has some vigorous work; there are two
nicely done portraits by Esther Paterson, some pleas-
ing miniatures by May Klug and Edith Boyd, and a
rather poor show of sculpture.
Blamire Young tosses over his head the rapturous
colors which the break of day makes in the surf;
and, having duly refreshed himself, he tosses the colors
on to his pictures. That is the impression his show
at the New Gallery, Elizabeth-street, gives. On his
descent to plain humanity he fails. The woman in
No. 1 who takes “Expert Opinion” has an impossible
chin; still the color scheme is well worked. Blamire
Young succeeds where his imitators fail; he can
smudge his pictures as he likes, but the smudge is
realistic. He can boldly ask fancy prices, too. Nearly
all the show is inspiring, but one wonders at the
inclusion of such a crude bit as “The Tree of Life.”
It is surprising to see such a picture from the brush
of an artist who painted the delicate “Woodsmoke”
(No. 50).
*»••••
The frames of Carl Hampel’s pictures at the Decora-
tion Gallery might be the casement of a window
through which you look out upon views of Australian
country, seeing them as you ought to see them. “The
Pale, Purple Even” (No. 14) is the most ambitious
offering—a fine thing; but finer are a number of
others, full of ethereal atmosphere and fine composi-
tion. “The Lakeside” (No. 12) appeals with its
delectably treated foliage and the misty glimpses of
the lake peeping through. There is extreme live-
liness in “Morning Brilliance” (No. 27) ; “Frost and
Sunlight” (No. 11) is another fine thing, and the
Sydney and Middle Harbor pictures are full of
spaciousness and sunlight. There are, besides, 14
flower studies, and none that isn’t desirable.
* * :J *
The latest Adelaide show is a plucky ven-
ture in grand opera at the Prince of Wales.
It started on Saturday with the good old
“Trovatore.” Filippini, who is mainly re-
sponsible for the venture, took the lead him-
self, with his wife conducting; Molinari and
Clarice Buchanan in support. Muriel Starr
and Frank Harvey came into the Royal the
same eveiiing; and at the Majestic Wee
Willie Lancet was dropped into a bill which
includes Florence and Clifton, clever acro-
bats.
“Hamfat” : Ella Carrington, who now has
a comfortable job at Hoyt’s De Luxe in Mel-
bourne, regarded the film version of “David
Copperfield” with mixed emotions —she has
played parts in many versions of the Dickens
story. It is hard to say whether the film
deals more with the story of Copperfield or
that of Micawber; anyhow, the Little Em’ly
episode is omitted. Ella Carrington, who
has played Little Em’ly and Peggotty and
(I think) Dora, was a partner in the Taylor-
Carrington co. which for years untold toured
Australia. She is now silver-haired and is
well satisfied to be out of the rough-and-
tumble game which touring drama was.
“Satis”: Arnold Bennett and Edward
Ivnoblock are once more collaborating in a
play. Their first venture, “Milestones,”
scored a bull’s-eye; their second, “London
Life,” missed. Their third attempt is an
adaptation of Bennett’s novel, “Mr. Pro-
hack” ; it will first of all see the footlights
in America, with the original title retained.
Poverty
Point
Charles Kenningham (“Charlik” and
“C.K.” of countless “Poverty Point” pars.)
died in Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, at
the week-end. No tenor the Firm ever brought
THE MANAGER’S RIGHT WHEN THE GIRL'S WRONG.
“You've got a lot of applicants for your new ballet —you can't
take 'em all, can you?”
“ Oh , no, of course we’ve got the right to exclude any girl we
think proper.”
to Australia enjoyed a longer reign of popu-
larity. Arriving in 1898, be sang the princi-
pal tenor rOles in “The Gondoliers,” “Mika-
do,” “Yeomen of the Guard,” “La Poupee,
“Dorothy,” “Ma Mie Itosette,” and many
other comic operas; and his parts in Mus-
grove’s magnificent Shakspearean season of
21 years ago will long be remembered. Among
comic-opera artists that Australia has known
there have been few, if any, finer musicians.
He studied the organ under Sir John
Stainer in the days when he was a chorister
at St. Paul’s, in London, and before he was
20 he was organist of St. Luke’s, in Hull —
his birthplace. Afterwards he was tenor
soloist at Canterbury Cathedral —it was there
lie first met Kennerley Rumford —and still
later, as principal tenor at the Savoy, he
took a leading part in the first production
of at least three Gilbert and Sullivan operas.
A dozen years ago his hearing so far failed
that further work on the stage became impos-
sible ; and that terrible affliction clouded the
later years of his life.
“Ces”: When a boy in Melbourne long ago
I saw the great men of Australia’s first Gil-
bert and Sullivan co. walking majes-
tically down Bourke-street to the old Green-
room Club. Prominent among them was
Charles Kenningham with a huge cheese
under one arm and a suspicious bulge in his
hip pocket. It was the company’s habit in
those days to shout each other supper after
the performance, and never did Charlie allow
his turn to pass without purchasing a cheese.
That is my first memory of a delightful singer
and a charming fellow. The last is of an
old man, weak from illness and with fast-
fading hearing, thanking in tremulous tones
a hnge audience at a complimentary concert
in the Maryborough (Q.) Town Hall. I
like to think that Maryborough was kind to
an old favorite, and that some of the best
singers in Brisbane went up specially for
that, benefit. What a fine tenor he was in his
prime, and how perfectly he sang Sullivan's
haunting music! 1 have some programmes
of the first and second presentations of “The
Mikado,” and other G. and S. operas, on the
occasion of the 1895 revival at the Savoy,
London. Kenningham was the Nanki-Poo
of the second performance of “The Mikado”
on November ti, 1895. At the second Savoy
revival of “The Gondoliers” on March 22,
1897, lie appeared as Marco.
“S.G.”: “Charlik” (Charles Kenningham)
made one excursion from the stage and the
choir loft —for two years he was in the
stli Dragoon Guards. A fine figure of a
man, with a beautiful voice and a feeling
for both music and verse, Kenningham was
the ideal Gilbert-and-Sullivan tenor. No one
who saw him in his prime can forget his
exquisite singing of "Take a Pair of Spark-
ling Eyes,” or the impression he made in
parts like Marco and Ralph Rackstraw ; lie
was excellent, too, in such plays as
“Dorothy,” “The Geisha” and “Ma Mie
Rosette.” He was 6G at the end.
“Ancient Prompter”: Edwin Brett, who
has played every sort of part on Australian
stages in pantomime, musical comedy and
comedy of the drawing-room order, is with
us again. He has come back —this is his
fifth trip—to appear in Eden Phillpott’s
comedy, “The Farmer’s Wife,” which the
Firm is putting on in Melbourne in a few
weeks. Mrs. Brett (Emeline Orford) is also
in the cast.
“Lysander”: Miss Handley, author of
“The Mandarin Coat,” produced by the
Melbourne Repertory Society, lias not
studied the Australian detective in his native
lair or she wrote with one eye on the Ameri-
can market. Her sleuths were of the films
only. The native
product does not
yet enter drawing-
rooms with his }iat
on, nor suspected
houses by master-
key or burglarious
means without the
preliminary of a
warrant. Nor does
he adopt a bullying
attitude to owners
of butler-and-maid
mansions when such
plutocrats are only
faintly suspected of
being in league
with opium-smug-
gling. He knows
too well what a row
such a plutocrat
would make, not
only with his
“chief,” but with
about 65 members
of Parliament and
the newspapers.
Until he gets a con-
fession, or strong
outside proof that
he has his man,
the British detec-
tive is one of the
most cautious and
apologetic of offi-
cials. On a stage
allegedly Australian a detective bouncing a
bourgeois is as unreal as .the reporter who
tears around armed with a fountain-pen and
a typist’s notebook, bent on stand-and-deliver
interviews.
“Hamfat”: Edna Thomas has upset the
theatrical axiom that if a show fails to get
a full house on the opening night it is
doomed. From the box-office point of view
she started badly in Melbourne, but she was
soon doing “capacity” business; and her re-
turn season was one crowded house after an-
other. The elaborate stage setting which
Frank Talbot arranged for the lady probably
had a good deal to do with her success. At
all events, she has made enough money in
Melbourne to be well ahead of it, even
should she back a trot of losers at the Cup
meeting, for which she is staying on, though
her season has closed. Edna will be back in
Sydney on November 14.
“Demetrius”: In “The Mandarin Coat”
Isabel Handley gives Eric Lister some of the
most fatuously galumphing lines ever put
between man’s lips on the stage. Coltish
humor, exaggerated misquotation, inane self-
glorification facetiously-meant, would-be
smart sayings between youthful antagonists,
half-boorish repartee —they sent cold shivers
down a hearer’s back. Pinero never put
anything like that into a play. Yet are not
those inanities racy of Darlinghurst and
East Melbourne? No household of people
ever “kept it up” conversationally as Shaw
or Barrie sometimes makes them, delightfully
as it rings on the ear; but a bore with a
reputation for entertaining can (and docs,
God forgive him!) maintain the Lister sort
of stuff for minutes —perhaps hours. Has
our Australian playwright been clever enough
to pioneer a new and dreadful school of
home-grown realism ?
"Bill o’ C.” : I hate to butt into any other
party’s dispute, but it seems fortunate that
“Mid-Channel” (B. 15/10/’25) didn’t back
with any cash his challenge to someone “to
name a single ‘aside’ of which Pinero has been
guilty.” If he will look at the printed ver-
sions of most of P.'s early and middle-period
plays—say, “Dandy Dick,” "The Amazdns"
or “The Weaker Sex” —he will find a liberal
scattering through the dialogue of “to him-
self” 1 and “under his breath.” “The Weaker
Sex” affords a few choice specimens. In
one scene Mrs. B. C. is flirting in a recess
of the room with Mr. Bargus, who is really
struck on her daughter, when they art 1 in-
terrupted by I). The lady, to cover the situa-
tion, advances and addresses D. Then the
gent, in the recess speaks:—
Bargus (to himself, with horror): “I see it! It’s
all in a nutshell. The mother has taken it to her-
self. I’ve gone into the wrong lobby!” (He is a
member of Parliament.)
Mrs. B. 0. (to D.) : “I think Mr. Bargus is in
there.”
D.: “Is lie? (To himself) Oh, ves, there’s the
infant. (To Bargus) How d'ye do?”
Later in the same play three ladies are dis-
cussing how a fourth has, apparently, been
overcome by the heat. Thus:—
Mrs. B. 0.: “The heat! She hasn’t told you of
the strange”
Svi.via: “Not told me? Of what, dear Mrs. Chew-
ton ?”
Mrs. B. C.: “Of —-of the strange sensations in her
head. (To herself) I forgot that llhoda learnt of
the affair by accident and that I am supposed to
know nothing.”
The clumsiness of this aside would take some
beating, and is very surprising from P.’s
tradesman-like hand. It is true that P. re-
formed with the times, but he seemed to do
it reluctantly, for scraps of asides and
soliloquies, though not particularly inartistic
ones, persisted in some of his later work.
“S.F.”: Sir Thomas Beecham, now being
sued by London money-lenders for £lO,OOO,
was left with a fortune and a love of music
by his father, Joseph, the maker of the
famous pills, who, as a small boy, used to
save his pennies for a gallery seat at Covent
Garden. When Joseph died the fortune
and the love of music cancolled each other
in the once world-renowned Beecham Sym-
phony Orchestra, on which Thomas squan-
dered his father’s guineas. A great con-
ductor, he was also a royal spender, and
when the war broke out his project of making
London the musical centre of the world col-
lapsed. Thomas’s son, William, inherits the
family failing, but, on present appearances,
will not have millions to indulge it.
“Chutney”: Nigger shows used to be popu-
lar in the Indian Army of my time, and
we really had fine musicians as well as some
wild young subs equal to any devilment. Of
course you know the old business between
the corner-men and the interlocutor, “Mr.
Johnson.” Well, one night the General and
a party of ladies —the old man’s wife was
very straight-laced, by the way —were pre-
sent. Mr. Johnson put the question: “Well.
Mr. Bones, what have you been doing lately?”
“Me, Massa Johnson ! W’y, I done bin read-
in’ hard.” “Beading! And, pray, what
have you been reading, sir?” “W’y, dem
‘Heavenly Twins.’ ” “Oh, indeed! Sarah
Grand’s novel. And what do you think of
it, Mr. Bones?” “Golly, Massa Johnson, 1
juss t’ink dem ‘Heavenly Twins’ mighty fine
conception.” Then Mr. Johnson in a loud
voice announced “Come Where My Love Lies
Dreaming,” while the General chuckled, and
his lady looked down her nose.
“Nakhoda” : When The Bulletin’s hand-
some and intelligent copyholder starts recit-
ing this paragraph to the reverend reader
(if he ever does), he will enunciate it in
precisely the same way as a Malay Hamlet
declaims. his lines on the Malayan stage;
that is, with all the commas, colons and full-
stops faithfully repeated. Arabic, which the
Malay uses, having no signs of punctua-
tion, he was constrained to invent words to
take their places. “To be comma or not
to be colon that is the question colon” may
sound a trifle incongruous to the foreigner,
but the native playgoer seems used to it.
“Cmsar’s Ghost” : Michael Arlen’s neurotic
but cleverly-written “The Green Hat,” one
of the literary best-sellers of the last couple,
of years, has been licked into dramatic shape,
and threatens to have a long run at the
London Adelphi, although the critics are
doubtful about its quality. There is reason
for doubt. The first act deals with the death
of Iris Storm’s husband, and her explanation
that he “died for purity” ; in the second, the
erratic lady seduces a young man, who, en-
gaged to someone else, has some scruples;
in the third, she lies in hospital, after giving
birth to a child, and the end brings her finish
by motor-car suicide. In America, which
still likes to amuse itself with the English
aristocracy, however bogus, the play has
already made a big success. It is the sort
of tiling that is bound to come this way in
time.
THE RULING PASSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I never see a stage-door now”—
He wet his lips and dried them —
“ ’Tis forty years or more, I vow,
Since first I hung outside them;
Those were the days of big bouquets
For favorite stars and coryphees—
We stricken swains supplied them.
“We pressed the door-keep sour and grim
Our love notes to deliver.
It meant, of course, a tip for him
From every amorous giver ;
Then hung about till they came out—
The various charmers, slim or stout,
Who set our hearts a-quiver.
“Though now I rarely see a stage,
’(Jainst habit there’s no striving.
Since picture stars became the rage,
To meet them I’m contriving;
Outside the movie show I wait,
A stage-door johnnie up to date,
To see (oh, age degenerate!)
A reel of film arriving!”

-made Pipe /
Many folk marvel at the beautiful
workmanship of the “BBB” Pipe, and
the exquisite fit of vulcanite mouth'
piece to Bruyere stem. This is because
it is “Tailor-made”—each separate
mouthpiece—made from the finest of
fine quality vulcanised Para Rubber—is
shaped and fitted to each individual pipe.
Such care as this in the making of a
pipe is unusual. But then, of course,
the wonderful aged and matured
Bruyere we use for making “BBB”
Pipes is worthy of all the care that
60 years’ experience could conceive.

Back of production is the Westinghouse policy—build only as
many batteries as can be built well—uphold the name Westing-

one, their batteries are as good as the best and better than
most. Westinghouse attention means universal service, and,
what is of prime importance, the price is right— a price based

With villainy awash in all their pores.

A Year Ahead of Its Time
The Duplex—more up-to-date than newest "yearly models
THE Duplex body, introduced by Stude-
baker in 1924, is a revolutionary new-
type open car—-with advantages open cars
never possessed before.
It has a steel-framed upper structure, built
as an integral part of the body.
Within this upper structure are concealed
roller side enclosures which the driver may
lower in 30 seconds without leaving his seat
-—giving instart protection from rain, cold or
wind. With equal ease the enclosures roll up
out of sight. •
So obvious are the advantages of the
Duplex that Studebaker has become the out-
standing leader in the open car field.
Triumph of Studebaker Engineering
Other manufacturers will undoubtedly have
to follow in Studebaker’s footsteps. For any
open car today without this unique advantage
is obsolete.
But at the time this advertisement is
written, Studebaker and Studebaker
alone —offers you this double convenience.
Only Ford and Studebaker make in
their own factories all bodies, engines,
clutches, differentials, steering gears,
springs, axles, gear boxes, gray iron cast-
ings and drop forgings used in their cars.
Studebaker is the only one-profit manu-
facturer in the fine car field.
Another important engineering advantage
pioneered by Studebaker is the use of gen-
uine, full-size balloon tyres, with steering
mechanism, mudguards and body lines espec-
ially designed for them.
On the Studebaker Standard Six Duplex-
Phaeton illustrated above, you’ll find an
automatic spark control, safety lighting con-
trol on the steering wheel, 8-day clock, petrol
gauge on the dash, improved one-piece
windscreen, special coincidental lock of igni-
tion and steering gear, foot-controlled cowl
ventilator, completely machined crankshaft,
oil drain valve which a girl can operate with-
out soiling her hands, and waterproof igni-
tion —all Studebaker features.
These are a few of the points which show
that Studebaker cars are more up-to-date
than any new “yearly models”.
Any automobile expert will tell you that
new models of necessity are engineering
experiments. Only after months of use in
the hands of owners can all mechanical
flaws be eliminated. Automobile engineers
are human —and it takes time to eliminate
mistakes.
Thus, when you buy a Studebaker, you
not only get a motor car that is completely
up-to-date, but you also eliminate all guess-
work and gamble. Your new car has been
tested and proved satisfactory in the hands of
thousands of owners.
Go to any of the Studebaker dealers listed
below —and see a “one-profit” car with scores
of thousands of miles of excess transportation
built into it. Ride in it drive it. Ask par-
ticularly to see the Duplex—the open car
which made all other ppen cars obsolete.

“Keppel”: The Queensland Prickly-pear
Commission is making a test of a new spray,
invented by J. Pohlman and provisionally
patented in Melbourne. The spray consists
of 25 per cent, sugar, which, it is claimed,
sets up fermentation in the pear-plant and
reduces it to a mass of jelly within a few
weeks. The mixture can be supplied to the
farmer for Is. per gallon, and very little is
required for each plant.

“Yacko” : The Sydney-Parramatta railway
was not the first Government-owned line
opened for traffic in Australia (B. 1/10/’25).
That distinction belongs to South Aus., which
indeed can claim to have had the first Gov-
ernment-controlled line in the British
Empire. The Port-to-Adelaide railway
(71m.) was opened for traffic on April 1,
1856; the Sydney-Parramatta line was
opened six months earlier, but it was not
taken over by the Government from the pri-
vate co. which built it until Dec. 1, 1858.
Outside of South Aus. the first two Govern-
ment-built lines in Australia were Queens-
land’s Ipswicli-to-Grandchester railway,
opened for traffic on July 31, 1865, and
Westralia’s Geraldton-to-Nortliampton line,
opened July 26, 1879.
* * * *
“Mercator”: The whaling season at the
Point Cloates station (Nor’-West W.A.),
which commenced in June, is just closing
with highly profitable results. The catch had
to be limited to three or four whales a day
for each of the three steamers engaged, and
this was easily accomplished, the total being-
over 650 for the season. As each whale
yields approx, four tons of oil besides guano,
the revenue should be over £lOO,OOO. The
present season’s operations have been con-
ducted in conjunction with a Norwegian whal-
ing co., which supplied steamers and men, and
the results show that the latter have lost none
of their hereditary skill at the business. In
the previous two or three seasons the local
co. could not account for more than an aver-
age of two whales per day, which was hot
profitable.
* * * *
“Sierra” : “Kir” repeats an old error when
he credits the White Star liner Phoenician
with being the first vessel to take Austra-
lian gold to England (B. 8/10/’25). On
June 3, 1851, the barque Thomas Arbuthnot,
627 tons, cleared Sydney Heads with the
first gold ever carried out of Australia. This
was a small consignment from Ophir and
Turon, and when assayed in London was
found to be 5 per cent, purer than stand-
ard gold. The barque Mary Bannatyre fol-
lowed on July 25, with 33280 z., valued at
£11,648. She also carried to Europe the
exciting news that the world’s largest
nugget (1061 b.) had been deposited in a
Bathurst bank. The Bondicar (claimed by
Runciman in his “Before the Mast and
After” to be the first gold-ship) left on
August 9, with gold worth £28,785 ; and the
following month the May Queen cleared the
Heads with 13,4620 z., valued at £43,752.
The Phoenician did not leave Sydney until
November 11, two months after the first
shipment had arrived in London.

“A.R.W.” : “S.R.” (B. 8/10/’25) suggests
the cultivation of American hickory. The
area in which it is likely to be successfully
grown includes much of M.L., Tas. and the
mountainous part of Vic. and N. S. Wales.
The tree requires a moderately good rainfall
and soil and a cold winter. There are 10 —-
some say 12—species native to North
America, varying in quality from rubbish up-
wards. It is a nut tree, the fruit being like
small walnuts. The best nuts are produced
by the pecan, which, however, has a some-
what brittle wood. The best wood comes
from the pig-nut, which, however, is water-
loving and therefore not suitable for Aus-
tralia, and the nuts are so inferior they are
usually not gathered. The best general-pur-
poses hickory is the sliellbark, shagbark or
white hickory (Hicoria avata) , which has
a good edible nut and supplies the bulk of
the timber that is worked into axe and ham-
mer handles. The nut should be planted
where the tree is meant to grow, as the seed-
lings do not transplant well; and particular
care should be taken in obtaining the nuts
intended for seed, as some of the American
hickories, notably water-hickory, are rubbish.

“Tabac”: In 1868 certain mill-owners
named Rylands made a reservoir. During its
excavation the workmen came on some
ancient mine shafts and filled them in. In
due time water ran into the reservoir, but
ran out almost as fast. Neighbor Fletcher,
who had adjoining mines, suffered loss by
the inflow of water, which had percolated
from the ancient shafts. This was a nice
point for the lawyers and to it they went.
That case has become an authority, for in
it the law was laid down that if a person
brings on his land anything which, if it
should escape, may damage his neighbor, he
does it at his peril. So Fletcher got dam-
ages and the Rylands had to make other
reservoir arrangements. Now in this case the
Rylands knew all about it, or their work-
men did, and the latter’s knowledge was their
masters’ so far as responsibility went. This
old leading case was recently revived in an
English court. A District Council had made
a sewer about 9ft. underground, passing
through the land of A, who, without any
disclosure as to the sewer, sold it to a lady,
She, knowing nothing about any sewer, built
a wall which passed over the concealed chan-
nel, and broke it. Whereupon the District
Council sought damages against her and
quoted old-friend Fletcher v. Rylands. It is
the blessed privilege of Judges, when they
desire to do what they conceive to be a fair
thing between parties, to differentiate one
case from another. This of course can always
be done, since no two cases are exactly alike.
So Branson, J., came to the conclusion that
it would be unreasonable to say that an occu-
pier should suffer in damages on account of
injury to something buried in the ground of
which she did not know and could not rea-
sonably be expected to know. The Rylands
case was different, for there the occupiers
did know or could reasonably have been ex-
pected to know. So he found for the defen-
dant and allowed her costs. Which was
common sense as well as common law.

Australasian Representatives:—
Nortnan Baker & konpth.nst
60 York Street. Sydney.
“Billy See”: Exhibited in a Perth shop
is a gallon of boronia attar valued at £lBOO.
This is the product of a local laboratory
which is busy bottling the perfume of W.A.’s
daintly-s'cented wild flowers. The local
market is well supplied, and the jar of con-
centrate is booked for London. The same
laboratory, using a secret process of extrac-
tion, reckons it can supply the world with
sandalwood oil.
“Sturt”: Adelaide land values have gone
up another notch, the scene being the usual
one on the north side of Bundle-street, just
east of Gawler-place. The Wondergraph
site brought £1238 a foot in 1920, a record
up to then, and paid for a special propose;
but in February last a larger frontage close
by fetched £1331, in April the rest of the
Catt Store site made £1450, and now the
Sneyd firm has bought out the adjoining
Federal Boot Co. at £1607 a foot.
“C. Coral” : A typhoon up China way has
caused the price of trochus shell to soar
again; it has approached the £lOO-a-ton
mark, but may slump at any time. The
Torres Strait fleets have been giving
motlier-o’-pearl a bye for awhile and work-
ing trochus, since the former dropped right
down some time back. Another item that
has been receiving attention lately is shark
fins; eighteenpence a pound has been paid
by Chinese buyers for the soup delicacy.
“Noot”: Coff’s Harbor (N.S.W.) was
originally “Korff’s.” Recently there was
shown in a local shop window a photo of
Captain John Korff, who in 1848, accom-
panied by his nephew, sailed from Sydney
for the Bellinger River. A storm blew them
out of their course and when it was over
they anchored where their name (corrupted)
is still commemorated. The nephew died in
Aslifield about 10 years ago.
F. P. Chambers, who has passed out at
Coolangatta (Q.), had ability, personality,
wit, eloquence and an extraordinary know-
ledge of men and affairs; but his ambition
led him no farther in public life, than a job
as president of Tweed Shire. Transplanted
from London at an early age, he served with
the C.S.R. as analysing chemist, then settled
in Murwillumbah, and was content to spin
out his days on a comfortable fortune in that
quiet country town.
“The Traveller” : Hamilton ( Vic.) has just
had an “All Australia Week.” Included in
the shop-window display was a selection of
Australian woods carved and worked by
Australian boys at the State High School. It
was good to see. The polished samples of
district timbers —blackwood, sheoak, etc.—
made one long for dinkum Australian-wood
furniture. And to think of the millions of
tons of such timbers I have helped to burn.
But we are learning from the children.
Priminister Bruce’s statement in Brisbane
that when he took seriously to politics seven
years ago he was regarded by his club-mates
as an amiable lunatic recalls that before
Federation J. L. Purves, Q.C., was reported
to have described Alfred Deakin as an ami-
able lunatic. When there was a loud outcry
of protest the then leader of the Bar ex-
plained that he had been misheard. What
he had said was that his learned friend was
“an amiable balloonatic.” His critics let it
go at that.
Some extraordinarily youthful fighters
from M.L. figured in the Great War. A lad
who gave his age as 20 enlisted when his
real age was only 14. He Avas wounded at
16, and at 23 came before the Pensions Board
with a Avife and four children. He Avas Eng-
lish born but had lived in M.L. most of his
days. A Maori youth enlisted at about 14
too, fought at Gallipoli, was sent back to
M.L., and re-enlisted at 17. but his wahine
turned up at the Defence Office at Rotorua
with the intimation that if he wanted fur-
ther fighting she would oblige him, and led
him home. The Defence authorities capitu-
lated.
“X.N.0.” : I am glad to learn from “Ida
D.” (B. 8/10/’25) that somewhere in the
world a compliment is being returned. “Ida
says that on an English estancia in the
Argentine it is considered a breach of eti-
quette to speak anything but Castellano if
an Argentinian is present. A fcAV months
ago I was one of tAvo Britishers at lunch on
board the Swedish s.s. Boren in Sydney
Harbor. There were 12 or 14 present as
Captain Hultman’s guests, and for the whole
of lunch-time not one Avord was spoken in
any but the English language, even when
our Swedish fellow-guests were conversing
amongst themselves.
“Jog”: A Chinese opium-dealer at Bun-
claberg (Q.) hit upon an audaciously simple
plan for getting supplies forwarded to him
—he had the stuff sent as an ordinary packet
through the post office addressed to a sup-
posititious Ganger Jones, c/o himself. Hoav
the police dropped to the scheme has not
been disclosed, but as soon as the postman
left the parcel a constable marched into the
shop and fixed a meaning glance on the
contraband. The storekeeper offered lnm
£5 not to find any opium, but he did and
took it away, four tins in all. The P.M.
told Ah Sin that it would cost him £5O, and
intimated that the informer (the policeman)
could have half, a plain tip to Sin to otter
more than a fiA 7 er next time.
“Forebridge”: Talking of skilful navi-
gators, no mention has yet been made of
Admiral Sir Henry Oliver, the cleverest navi-
gator the British Navy has seen in recent
years A man of few words, “Dumby
Oliver juggled with fleets and squadrons in
the most uncanny way. A few years before
the Avar, as Master of the Channel Fleet he
piloted an armada of more than 50 ships
from the Clyde to the Scilly Islands in a
pea-soup' fog. When the fleet anchored m
Avhat Dumby declared was St. Mary s Roads,
there was no sign of land, it being impos-
sible to see 100 yards. The Admiral, who
wished to send an urgent telegram, was much
perturbed and asked Oliver’s. advice. Call
away your galley, sir,” replied the laconic
Dumby. “Tell the coxswain to steer n.-n.-e.
for 10 minutes, when the boat will ground
on a sandy beach. If the man then walks
n-w by w. for 400 yards he will come to
the local post office.” The directions were
followed, and the coxswain duly arrived at
the p. 0.; moreover, when the fog lifted
the flagship Avas found to be within 25 yards
of the position Oliver had assigned to it
on the chart.

Be Pretty! Be Dainty!
Be Attractive! Be a Rexona Girl!

Miss RONNIE EARN SHAW, a
charming Rexona Girl, writes: “l
have used Rexona Soap continu-
ally, and find it keeps the skin
in perfect condition.”
Rexona
Soap
It’s Medicated!
Rexona Girls are world-famous
for their beautiful Skin and Hair.
To be a Rexona Girl is to use only
Rexona Soap and enjoy that natural
beauty of the skin and hair which
cannot be imitated, but can be
obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary Toilet Soaps do not
assert this influence. Many of them
contain free alkali, which tends to
dry the skin and destroy its delicate
texture. Even the best of such soaps
can only cleanse, they cannot heal
and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same
soothing, healing, antiseptic balsams
as Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the
value of which in the treatment of
skin affections is known throughout
the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap regularly once or twice
a day and see if it does not quickly
soothe and cleanse the pores, lessen
the tendency to pimples and leave
the complexion clear, fresh and vel-
vety.

The Forest Bright.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
trees are silent. No birds sing
Within the forest bright; the hush
Of noonday lies on everything
That lives within the bronze-green bush.
This surely is the forest bright;
Not that far forest dim of song
Whose shadowed aisles defy the light
Of sun and moon the whole year long.
No antlers haunt these sylvan ways,
No hunter hunts them with his lance,
Or sees beneath a leafy maze
A troop of maidens wliitely dance.
A thousand pictures of the past
Framed in those olden woods these trees
Know not, nor knew. This ground they cast
Their shade on has no memories
Like woods where storied fountains gleam,
Where on their trees the soft leaves dance,
As though they felt within a dream
The stir, the wind, of past Romance.
The wind that shakes the leaves of gold
Blows in from an unstoried sea,
Except for those wild secrets told
By wave and wind to leaf and tree.
The record of our race is brief.
But yet these forest leaves have spanned
Another race, its joy and grief
Long lost in a forgotten land.
Not all unknowing, then, these woods ;
For ere our thronging vessels came,
Long centuries their solitudes
Beheld the sacred human flame.
A lower race, we say. ’Tis true
We fly above the rocks they trod ;
But higher than we ever flew
There stand the flawless scales of God.
How would it seem to us if they,
The nearly kin of bird and brute,
* Who lived to eat, to sleep, to slay—
The fcastcrs on the uptorn root—
Who were as we were in the vast
Wild silence of our race’s youth,
Shall equal be to us at last
In the contemptuous light of Truth?
Contemptuous of the deeds we claim
Have marked our rise through all the
years!
Look back upon the road we came,
Whose dust we laid with blood and tears!
Nay, look not back! Look forward, for
The bitterness we did is done.
We hold upon this utmost shore
Of Time and Space what we have won—■
The lights that show us where to go.
We may not travel to the right,
But through these lamps we won, w T e know
We need not stumble through the night.
Such thoughts must come; it is our lot.
But we can banish them awhile
To rest in some green, sunny spot,
Rejoicing in the forest smile;
This lovely screen of green and gold
And bronze, through which the sunshine
showers,
Has balm to give to us who hold
The friendship of its trees and flowmrs.
And with their varied music now
The forest people flock to me;
Three honeyeaters on this bough,
A thrush upon that sheoak-trec.
With color and with melody
I leave this leafy place alight;
From its green altars go with me
The blessings of the forest bright.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT the first stroke of eight-bells young
/~\ Seacombe, the third mate, stepped
oft' the last rung of the starboard
ladder to the strip of sodden coir-matting
that flogged the deck of the bridge. Watch-
keeping officers in the merchant service do
not always come so punctually to the relief
as this; especially in foul weather.
He could have arrived on the bridge much
earlier even than this, and the second mate,
who leaned in streaming oilskins against the
straining of the dodger, knew it. Twenty
minutes before the hour of relief there had
been a briefly-enduring flood of light upon
the wet deck of the alley-way as the third
mate had opened and closed his cabin door,
and a moment later* a little swirl of sparks
from his pipe betrayed the fact that he was
sheltering against a ventilator on the boat-
deck waiting for eight-bells to strike.
In step with the normal march of routine
those minutes of which the third mate was
now so prodigal would be hugged by the
sleepy-eyed watch below as delicious fugitive
moments, fleeting all too fast before the im-
pending bell-strokes that sound the doom of
<lolce far nichte and warm blankets. But
the officer of the watch, although he never
ceased to stare ahead into the angry dark-
ness, could follow in his mind’s eye all the
movements of his immediate junior. And
he could do this with certitude for two rea-
sons. One reason was that young Seacombe
had been behaving thus on every one of his
watches below since the ship left Adelaide.
As for the other reason—-well, the second
mate had himself been guilty of precisely the
same behavior as. the trip came to an end.
The unsleeping disquiet of their cabins had
proved too much for them both.
The steamer was laboring heavily in the
throes of a full gale, and the wind would
cut like a whip-lash if one’s face was lifted
an inch too high above the dodger. Down
in the forward Well-deck a tarpaulin thrashed
the hatch-covers of No. 2 hold like an iron
flail wielded by a giant; and the sea every
few moments came snarling savagely through
a hatvse-pipe and rushed in foaming torrents
around the. hatch-coamings. The forward
rigging shrieked like souls swaying on the
pit-brink of perdition.
At intervals the wind would ease for a
breathing-space, as if the Storm God was
husbanding his forces, but only that they
might be hurled at the lurching ship w r ith
increasing fury. At the height of these
paroxysms came heavy discharges of rain
and spray that flew over the bridge and
pelted against the weather-cloths and the
crowns of the officers’ sou’westers like spent
leaden bullets; and the chorus of the storm
lost its diverse voices and roared into deafen-
ing crescendo.
“It’s a bit dirty to-night,” said young Sea-
combe at the first lull.
“Yes,” the second mate replied, and added
after a moment without enthusiasm; “Oh,
well, we’ll be in Sydney this time to-morrow
night.”
“Yes, yes, that’s so,” agreed his brother-
officer in a voice as dreary as the obscurity
before them.
The wheel was relieved, but the second
mate, though free to go below, still lingered
as if loath to leave the wind-swept bridge
and the companionship of the younger man ;
and the latter, just as eager that his senior
should stay, saw to it that during the lulls
a conversation, even if trite and monosyl-
labic, was maintained.
From the desultory observations that he
had pieced together during the last few days
young Seacombe knew that the second mate
was at last bowing to the wishes of his
family and was leaving the sea at the end of
this trip. In exchange the older man had looked
for some like confidences from the third
mate, but so far had looked in vain. Yet
since the times were so fumbled, and this
was his last night at sea, and because he
was getting rather peevish at Seacombe’s
reticence, he broke out bitterly:
“Don’t know how I’ll stand being ashore,
Mister. Going into business. Never go to
sea again, I s’pose. You don’t know what
it means”
To his surprise the third mate said
quickly; “Yes, I do. By the Lord Harry,
Ido ! I’m chucking the sea myself ! Paying
off to-morrow” —and lie spoke no other word
until the next lull was nearly finished.
Then he remarked: “I’ll be turning down
an A 1 berth in the Far East line, too.”
The rising blast cut him short; but as the
next pause between the stresses of the storm
brought no further elucidation, the second
mate went disconsolately below, stamping
his chilled feet along the boat-deck.
The Terrigal was alongside her wharf at
9 o’clock the next night, and after she had
made fast the third mate leaned against the
rail of the deserted boat-deck and surrendered
to his thoughts.
An hour passed, and he was still there
scowling at the walls of the wharf—-the mid-
riff between shore-life and sea-life —beyond
which lay the city where the ghostly glow
sent up from the light-flooded streets ate far
into the darkness. He began to think bitter
thoughts about this city which was to land
him after he had been drawn kicking from
his natural element. It has ever been a
commonplace for the seafaring man to talk
longingly of life ashore; to revile the sea and
compare seaboots, much to their disfavor,
with carpet slippers. But give him to un-
derstand that he is to bo sentenced to an
existence between bricks and mortar, that
wide sea-liorizons must shrink to wall-
frowned purlieus, and that no more shall
he feel the lift and surge of a ship's deck
beneath him, but that his feet shall tread
inert pavements—bring him up against these
facts and mark the change.
The arc-lamps on the wharf suddenly
clicked out, and Seacombe left the rail and
began to pace the dark boat-deck. After a
while he lengthened the tract of deck lie
was tramping, until he halted in the patch
of light that fell through the open door of
the second mate’s cabin.
The second mate, fully-dressed, lay in his
bunk, an open book upon his chest, his eyes
intent upon the spirals of smoke that left
his pipe to wreath a thin mist around the
electric-light bulb. He seemed relieved to
see young Seacombe.
“Er—what was that you were saying
about the Far East line last night?” he said
the instant he caught sight of the figure in
the doorway.
“Oh, well, you see, I was offered a berth
on that new packet, the Wang Ho; she’s
just on the way out from the Clyde. I've
got a bit of pull. Uncle in Hong Kong's
a director.” There was no hint of bragga-
docio in the young man’s voice. “Job was
put on the ice for me. I was to leave by
the Mantu Maru for Hong Kong next week.”
“My word, that’s the sort of job!” said
the second mate, his eyes sparkling through
the blue drift of smoke. “If I'd my time
over again that’s where I’d be. When I
was your age I was mate of a China packet
—Hong Kong, Shanghai, Nagasaki, Ran-
goon, Singapore. Calcutta, everywhere ! That
was the life! Pukka game! Glamor o’ the
East an’ all that, yon know!” lie plunged
into a current of reminiscences that carried
him and hjs hearer from far Cathay to the
Isles of Spice.
“Yes, I wanted all that,” said young Sea-
combe wistfully.
“What! Have you turned it down?” The
second mate’s startled query was a ranging-
shot searching for the difficult target.
“No*—that is, I haven't exactly turned it
down yet. But I will —to-morrow.”
“It’s better than coasting!” the second
mate fired his next shot.
“Oh, I know that all right! Better than
coasting? I should' think so! I’ve been
coasting all my time, too—except when I was
brass bound in the West Coast trade. Before
I joined this packet I was in the New Zea-
land trade. Foreign trade they call that!
Huh ! Foreign trade ! Ducking across the
Tasman! Flying-fish trip! Why,” he con-
fessed bitterly, “I’ve never been across the
Line. And now I’ve got a chance for a first-
rate berth in a first-rate trade —and I can’t
take it! ”
“Why?” the second mate fired hastily; but
he was certain he would find the target this
time.
"You see” Young Seacombe nearly
gave it up. For a second or two he with-
drew from the doorway. Then he sidled into
the cabin and sat on the edge of the second
mate’s sea-chest. His voice sank very low.
“Well. I’m engaged to a girl—that is—er —
I think I promised to marry her.”
“Ah! Hm-m.... 0h!.... Even so!” The
second mate attempted to expostulate as he
sat up in his bunk with shoulders prepared
to shrug any mountain into a molehill.
“She’s making me give up the sea,” said
the third mate in a colorless voice.
“And you’re going to?”
“Yes.”

YOU May Have
Kidney Trouble!

l Every Picture '
Tells a S tory”
There is good cause to suspect your kidneys if
you have any stubborn pain in the small of the
back; for that is just where the kidneys are.
Heavy, throbbing backache
and sharp twinges when you
stoop or give your back a sud-
den twist tell you of inflamed
kidneys; kidneys sore, over-
worked and tired.
The kidneys have enough to
do when you are in good health
to filter the blood free of uric
poisons. Colds, fevers, over-
work or excesses of any sort
congest and overwork the kid-
neys. Unless promptly relieved,
what was at first a simple inflam-
mation will turn, in time, to
gravel, urinary trouble, dropsy,
lumbago, sciatica, rheumatism,
or some chronic form of kidney
disease.
If your kidneys are weak, take
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
the remedy that has been used
for over fifty years and is so
well recommended by people
from all parts of Australia.
DON’T BE PUT OFF—
INSIST ON DOAN’S.
SYDNEY RESIDENT
CURED.
Mr. A. Bartle, No. 3 Gladstone
Street, Bexley, Sydney, says:—“Off
and on for years I suffered with dis-
ordered kidneys, the result being that
I was tortured with backache. When I
had a bad attack my back used to be
so stiff and lame that I could not even
turn in' bed without suffering agony.
The kidney secretions were affected, be-
ing thick and cloudy with a red sedi-
ment. I was also subject to dizzy
attacks, and generally speaking felt fai
from well. One day a friend, hearing
of a cure by Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills, urged me to try them. I bought
some without delay, and used them with
excellent results. The first bottle gave
relief, and five bottles made a complete
and perfect cure.”
Eight years later Mrs. Bartle says:
“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
my husband of backache and kidney
trouble over eight years ago, and he has
had no return of the complaint since.”

keepers at 2/9 per bottle, or from

PILES AND ECZEMA CURED
BY DOAN’S OINTMENT.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Eczema Cured.
Mrs. Horwitz, Ethelwood, Hayward
Street, Kensington, Sydney, says :—“I
sent for a pot of Doan’s Ointment, and
used it for Eczema on my little girl’s
forehead. The rash covered the brow
and it was around the eye as well. The
itching was frightful, and it made her
very fretful and kept her from sleeping.
I had used several preparations previous
to getting Doan’s Ointment, but none of
them gave more than passing relief. I
am pleased to tell you that this remedy
cured her completely. We have since
used it on another little girl with
equally good results. Doan’s Ointment
is splendid, and I advise its use in all
itching skin diseases.”
Eighteen years later Mrs. Horwitz
states: —“My daughter lias not suffered
with Eczema since Doan’s Ointment
cured her eighteen years ago.”
Piles Cured.
Mrs. M. Brown, Toronto, Lyons Road,
Five Dock, Sydney, says “Three years
ago I used Doan’s Ointment for a bad
attack of Piles, and I am pleased to tell
you it completely cured me. Previous to
trying this ointment I tried all kinds of
remedies; but they gave me little or no
relief. I was suffering terribly when I
first applied Doan’s Ointment, and had
little hope of it doing me any good; but
its soothing and healing effects were
noticeable almost at once, and by the
time I had used one pot I was com-
pletely cured. I am a great believer in
Doan’s Ointment, and consider it the
best Pile remedy known. It cured me
after other remedies had failed.”
Four years later Mrs. Brown says:—
“I have had no return of my old com-
plaint since Doan’s Ointment cured me
about seven years ago.”

A TIN ALWAYS ON HAND.
“Oh, of course,” observed the mate,
striking many unnecessary matches. “M hen
a man’s in love he’ll give up anything—
cheerfully. Of course there’s not much in the
sea, after all. Dog’s life! Better off ashore
• —perhaps. Take kindly to life ashore after
a while. Bit of a break at first. lake
kindly” He ran out of words; and to
put a period to his palaverings he unscrewed
his unoffending pipe-stem and blew through
“I won’t take kindly to it, I’m afraid,
muttered the third mate dolefully.
“Oh ! Love, you know”
“I’m not in love,” said Seacombe, and bit
liis lip. “Think I’ll turn in ; it’s half-past
12 Funny we should be paying oft the
same day. Well, good-night, Mister.”
* * * *
At 5 o’clock the next afternoon, in
answer to a bell-ring, a self-possessed young
lady opened the door of a house m North
Sydney. One hand was busy with deft
coiffure-prinking touches; but she desisted
on seeing the man who stood on the thres-
hold, and, turning, called down the hall: “It s
only dad, Mum.”
The second mate was home!
He tried until tea-time to arrange his room
so that it might have some semblance of the
facile comfort of his cabin. Pipes and books
within reach. The electric-light switch with-
in the ambit of his left hand. The bed turned
about so that the light would fall from be-
hind instead of into his eyes. But these naive
preparations had to be abandoned when the
front-door Cerberus came into the room
shrilling her disapproval. , .
At tea-time he found his destiny being
shaped by the preordinations of three Fates.
Talkative Fates —but any attempt he made
to hoist himself well into the conversation
resulted in his promptly falling out of it.
His youngest daughter, Sadie, seemed ex-
tremely clever at pulling away liis conver-
sational ladder before he had climbed to a
full stop; and her sister, Christabel, had a
way of turning a pair of very intent blue
eyes upon him just after every tumble. He
was glad when he heard the scrape ot a
chair and looked up to find that his wife, who
had eyes like Christabel’s, had arisen from
the table. , . ~
Sitting down in an armchair near the
fire, he thrust out his feet and regarded his
brand-new foxhead slippers for some tmie,
his mouth distorted sardonically. A ripe,
blackened briar was returned to bis pocket
after his furtive glance had encountered
Sadie's book-top surveillance; but. a few
minutes afterwards, on detecting an exotic
fume upon the air, he was amazed to find that
young person stretched to the reading of her
five-day novel, a gold-tipped cigarette between
her lips.
It was going to be no easy matter to
orient himself in this menage; but one thing
lie was resolved upon, and that was the
necessity of asserting himself upon the first
favorable occasion—of establishing a prestige
that would for ever be unassailable, borne
circumstances must arise that he could turn
to his own account by a decisive coup d’etat;
but until that crisis, appeared he felt him-
self as impotent as his vulpine slippers.
He nodded drowsily before the fire, but
even sleep seemed to be denied him ; and he
came to with a start as his wife shook him
by the shoulder. Her mouth was a thin
horizontal line —he had seen Christabel s
mouth like that—and lie knew that when it
was compressed into this shape much speech
was presaged. Speech that was discompos-
ing. Things he did not wish to hear —ordi-
narily. What was it now?
“John! Chrissie is in the drawing-room
with her young man. I don't think we’ve
told you about him, John. But I must tell
you of him now. The poor girl has given up
other er-suitors I haven’t time to go into
details. But this is a very good match.
His relatives in Sydney are very well-to-do
people. Chrissie got him to ask them for
a position in their big Sydney business.
They’ve offered him one. A splendid chance
for a young man. But he seems to want to
wander about. Very foolish* Of course 1
know what he wants is a good girl like
Chrissie to keep his nose to the grind—l
mean to encourage him. And now lie’s
wavering, John ! Wrote from Adelaide ask-
ing to be released. Chrissie replied by wire
‘Certainly not.’ But lie’s wavering, John!
And you, the master of the house —are you
going to allow your daughter to be flouted
by—by this young philanderer?”
! The second mate stood up to his full
height. He teas the master of his house ! He
■had been second mate of a coaster, but he
tvas going to be master here —in supreme
command. He’d fix this young puppy who
dared to trifle with his daughter’s affections.
Wipe the deck with the bounder. And he’d
show this triumvirate that they could not
leave him —the head of the family—out of
their calculations!
He strode through the door like a Grena-
dier into a breach. Sadie dropped her book
and stared after him with the round eyes of
wonderment, and then her gaze coasted across
the room to find confirmation in her mother’s
blue eyes, in which astonishment was soon
narrowing to a hard glint of triumph.
In the drawing-room Chrissie perfunctorily
introduced a young man before she fluttered
out of the door; and the second mate found
liimself blinking foolishly into the blanching
face of young Seacombe, who thumped back
into the cushions, muttering some incolie-
rency ending in a husky “Sir.”
The second mate seemed to be handicapped
by an extreme dryness of throat, which after
several attempts he mastered sufficiently to
■produce an atonic voice. In this he in-
itfuired after young Seacombe’s health,
although but four hours ago, before their
’ ways diverged, lie had toasted that same
iiealth in a speeding glass at the North
Hotel.
i! Seacombe stammered something, but the
second mate did not hear it, as at that
moment a torrent of recollections had just
tumbled confusingly into his mind. There
were mental pictures of a not very pleased
Chrissie encountered near the Terrigal’s
wharf on several all-but-forgotten occasions—
; recollections of a peevish voice saying “Oh.
I thought I’d come and see how you’re getting
on.” Hm-m. You couldn’t beat them!
And behind it all the same dissevering
pair of hands that had snatched him from
the bosom of the sea!
A long time ticked audibly away, and then
the three women in the dining-room, with
ears attuned to the minutest sound, detected
low whispering in the hall, and started as
the tell-tale lock clicked out that the front
door was being opened.
At the corner of the street the visitor re-
iterated his plaint: “But Chrissie? It seems
mean clearing out like this without, saying”—
“Never mind,” gabbled the second mate,
casting anxious glances behind him, as he
stood beneath the street lamp shaking in his
fox-headed slippers, a very travesty of the
composure he vainly simulated. “Never
mind, I’ll explain. I’ll fix it all right. Look,
you’ll catch a tram if you run, Mister!”
Then, with a fearful backward glance, as his
companion’s grip closed gratefully on his
hand: “I think you’d better run, in any
case!”
Sailor-like, he looked aloft at the calm,
scintillating heavens before he went un-
steadily to his doom in the Star Chamber.
EDWARD SCOTT HOLLAND.
A Little Advice.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I REALLY don’t know how it happened.
I had a fairly good grip on the reins,
but the mare went down smash, both
knees on the metalled road. By the time
I had collected my wits she was up again,
and half a dozen small boys and two large
men had appeared from nowhere.
“Gosh, Mister, you've settled her knees!”
said one of the small boys. I looked and
agreed I had settled her well and truly.
At about this time I remembered that my
wife had been in the jinker with me when
the crash occurred, so i looked round for
her. A bit cut up and shaky—nothing to
make a fuss about. But my mare —what
was I going to do about her?
Well, 1 got her homo and then the fun
started.
O’Brien came over. “Been using hot
water on it?” he said. “Worst thing you
can do. Hose it, my boy ; nothing but the
hose. Plenty of cold water. And keep them
bandaged. Play the hose on ’em continu-
ally.”
Gillies put his head over the fence.
“Hear you broke the pony up,” he said.
“Get some lime. Don’t wash it whatever
you do. Just lime. Finest thing in the
world, lime. Splendid antiseptic.”
1 started off up to the saddler’s shop. I
had seen some black oil in the window a
week or two before.
“Sorry,” he said. “Haven’t a bottle left.
But, anyhow, I wouldn’t advise it for broken
knees. Too severe. Now here’s a bottle
of stuff I knocked together myself. Just
the thing. And,” he whispered, “the only
thing I know of to make the hair grow on a
horses’s knees.”
I started for home again. On the way 1
looked in at the blacksmith’s and told him
the news. He was interested. “What you
using? What! Cold water! Good heavens,
man—fancy hosing a broken knee! Hot
water and soft soap—as hot as you can use
it. Then you go round to my brother Jim.
He’s got some pink lotion; makes it him-
self. Just a dab with a bit of cotton wool
and you’ll be driving her in a week.”
Feebly I succumbed, and found myself
with a bottle of pink lotion. Brother Jim
was sympathetic. “Only too glad to be of
use. Don’t put on a lot of rubbish. Just
use the lotion.” So with the two bottles I
started for home.
Smith the cabby came down the street.
“Hear you let the little mare down,” he
said. “What you doing for it?” I showed
him the stuff. He crinkled up his nose.
“Spare me days!” he said. “You’ll be three
months curing her with that. Here, you
come over to my place, and I’ll give you
some dinkum stuff.” He produced a box of
powder. “Don’t get messing it up with that
other stuff. Just dab some of this on night
and morning. It’ll fix her up in no time.”
I ambled on and was almost in safety
when Jenkyns (spell it with a y, please)
whistled me. I stopped. “So tried to
kill the mare,” he boomed. “What you
using?” I produced the collection. He
snorted three times. “Chuck ’em all in the
rubbish tin. Use kero —just plain k-e-r-o-
-s-e-n-e. Nothing else. Why, they used
kerosene on Eudomythic the time he broke
his leg, and he won sixteen races afterwards.
Chucked out his leg a bit funny, that was
all. You use kerosene. No, never mind
what brand. Whisky-white is as good as any
other. You’ll get results. But that stuff!”
He snorted again and departed.
Rennie put his head over the fence as I
opened my gate. “They tell me you had a
bit of bad luck with the mare. What are
you putting on it?” I showed him the col-
lection and told him I had two cases of
kerosene ordered. He doubled up with
laughter. “Strewtli!” he said. “You are a
mug. Look you, get a bottle of phenyl. Plain
phenyl without any frills. Put it in a bucket
of warm water, and there you are! In a
week’s time she’ll be fit to start in a New-
market Handicap.”
Crellin told me to use fuller’s earth.
Hughes said permanganate of potash was
the only thing any sane man would think of
using. Gillies’s brother-in-law came over
and expressed the opinion that any man who
used anything but burnt leather and lard
should be prosecuted by the S.P.C.A. My
Wife’s brother rang me up and told me if I
used anything but a squeeze of the blue-bag
he’d be quite sure I wms as mad as my wife
often says I am. The butcher’s boy said
boracic acid and mutton-fat was what Scobie
used on Stand-by the day of the Melbourne
Cup. “And,” he hinted darkly, “you saw
what a great race he ran.” The milkman
pinned his faith to Solomon Solution. My
daughter’s fiasco brought me a mysterious
box of stuff for the secret of which his gran’-
father had been offered fabulous sums, but
died without revealing it. I’m glad he did.
It smelt awful.
That was three weeks ago. The mare is
all right now. While I was consulting the
neighbors my wife dressed the pony’s knees
and has been doing it ever since. What did
she use? I never asked her.
Oh, she's all right, barring a few scratches
and a sprained wrist and some odd bruises
here and there. But nothing to make a fuss
about.
