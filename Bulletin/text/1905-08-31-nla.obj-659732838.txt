SUPREME SUMMER.
O heart full of song in the sweet song-weather,
A voice fills each bower, a wing shakes each tree :
Come forth, O winged singer, on song’s fairest
feather,
And make a sweet fame of my love and of me.
The blithe world shall ever have fair loving
leisure,
And long is the summer for bird and for bee;
But too short the summer and too keen th
pleasure
Of me kissing her and of her kissing me.
Songs shall not cease of the hills and the heather
Songs shall not fail of the land and the SG&' l
But, O heart, if you sing not while we are together
What man shall remember my love or me ?
Some million of summers hath been and not
known her,
Hath known and forgotten loves less fair than she
But one summer knew her, and grew glad to own
her,
And made her its flower, and gave her to me.
And she and I, loving, on earth seem to sever
Some part of the great blue from heaven each day
I know that the heaven and the earth are for ever,
But that which we take shall with us pass away.
And that which she gives me shall be for no lover
In any new love-time, the world’s lasting while;
The world, when it loses, shall never recover
The gold of her hair nor the sun of her smile.
A tree grows in heaven, where no season blanches
Or stays the new fruit through the long golden
clime;
My love reaches up, takes a fruit from its
branches,
And gives it to me to be mine for all time.
What care I for other fruits, fed with new fire,
Plucked down by new lovers in their future line?
The fruit that I have is the thing I desire,
To live of and die of—the sweet she makes mine.
And she and I, loving, are king of one summer,
And queen of one summer to gather and glean :
The world is for us what no fair future comer
Shall find it or dream it could ever have been.
The earth, as we lie on its bosom, seems pressing
A heart up to bear us and mix with our heart;
The blue, as we wonder, drops down a great
blessing
That soothes us and fills us and makes the tears
start.
A. O’SHAUGHNESSY.
COPYRIGHT
THERE are in force in five States o:
Australia statutes relative to copyriglu
in literary, or artistic, or musical, or
dramatic work. These statutes are indepen-
dent and inconsistent. Where they do not
apply, Australian copyright is ruled by
British common law, British statutes, and
international agreements made by Britain.
Thus there have been six separate condi-
tions of Australian copyright, each of which
may be varied in several ways.
In no single State are the copyright
statutes adequate or consistent with them-
selves. The British statutes, admittedly un-
worthy, have been patched and mended from
time to time ; but Australian legislation has
not even been maintained. to imitate the
last British patch. Legislation in most of
the States, so far as literary copyright is con-
cerned, is based upon the British foundation
Act of 1842. Queensland, however, has been
content to pass registration Acts that merely
apply British legislation in force at their
date. Tasmania has not troubled to do that
much. ’
A thousand follies and anomalies result.
A Tasmanian copyright and every assignment
must be registered at Stationers’ Hall,
London. But if copyright in a Tasmanian
photograph, for example, is thus registered,
the right is protected for the owner’s life-
time and seven years additional ; while a
photograph in N.S. Wales is protected for
three years only. In N.S. Wales copyright
in news exists doubtfully. In W.A. it is
fully protected, because the W.A. Act was
passed 16 years later. And so on.
Plainly, anomalies should be removed.
Australians should be equal under the law.
The rights of authors, musicians, artists, and
others to control the publication of their
original work are everywhere admitted.
And the Constitution Act empowers the
Commonwealth Parliament to legislate re-
garding copyrights for the whole of Aus-
tralia.
The task of drafting a Bill to secure uni-
formity of conditions, and to raise Australian
copyright law to the level of modern ideas,
has been undertaken by Senator Keating.
His comprehensive Bill was introduced m
the Senate on 16 August. In a work of
difficulty he has succeeded ; and his Bill has
original value. It improves upon any similar
law yet enacted in English-speaking coun-
tries. Probably in some particulars it will
be found susceptible of further improve-
ment.
The object of Australian legislation should
be the protection and benefit of Australian
citizens. Australian legislation should not
be injurious to foreign nations unless neces-
sary for the security or advantage of Aus-
tralia. On the other hand, there is no
reason why it should protect or benefit
foreign nations, unless in exchange for
equivalent protection or benefit given by
them. These are principles preliminary to
Oie consideration of the Commonwealth
Copyright Bill.
SAID THE ACROBATS
OURS is one of the oldest professions in the
world. Why, until the other day, acro-
bats were wearing the gauze round the
shoulders and the fillets round the legs
that you see in old Roman pictures: we ’ve had
fillets on many a time. But the tricks have im-
proved : there’s little doubt of that.
We’re three Australian boys: three “Sydney
ducks ”:
Patrick Hand (understander) : age 33 ; height sft. 7in. ;
weight list. 41b. ; chest 3Slin. ; hips 39 ; thigh 23 : calf
14 ; upper-arm 13 ; fore-arm 10).
William Duckworth (middleman) : age 33 ; height sft.
Gin. ; weight list. ; chest, 39in. ; hips 34 : thigh 21 ; calf
15 ; upper-arm 15 ; fore-arm 13.
Jack Hkllkr. (topmounter) : age 24 ; height sft. 6in. ;
weight lOst. 41b.; chest 3Sin.; hips 36 ; thigh 20 ; calf 15 •
upper-arm 13 ; fore-arm 10).
You see we re not very big men : very big men
cion t make acrobats, except as understanders.
Ihey can’t fling themselves about, and they’re
apt to fall heavy. The understander or bearer is
the man on the ground, the man who supports the
° • ufi *' wo 011 s shoulders; then comes the
middleman ; and the topmounter’s name explains
itself. Heller is heavy for a topmounter. The
ideal weights would be : Understander 12 stone,
middleman 11, and topmounter 8. You can fling
a boy -tbout to do more startling tricks than we
show, but for three men of that weight you can
say that we’re equal to any three acrobats that
ever came to this country. Present address is the
livoh 1 heatre, Sydney; professional name, “The
Hazaras. ’ The public like a label that covers all
the goods.
.The. dictionaries don’t agree with our way of
speaking. We speak of “an acrobatic team,”
an acrobatic act,” “doing acrobats”; never of
acrobatism.” We don’t call a tight-rope per-
former an acrobat; or a trapeze-performer : he is a
gymnast. A contortionist is n’t an acrobat either.
A tumbler is an acrobat if he has others with him :
to do acrobats you must have a mate, or you must
have a team. A team of acrobats consists of three
men, or two men and a boy. It’s nearly always
a boy on top. You can have four up, but th
topmounter would have to be a baby. The weight
might run 12 stone, 10 stone, 7 stone, 5 stone. Th
first team of acrobats came to Australia 20 year
a a° Carl, Duran, and Samuels, engaged with
rryars company, and calling themselves “th
Marvels of Peru.”
The turn you saw us doing at the Tivoli consist
of eight tricks. Here they are in professiona
language :
Introduction.
1. Hand back somersault up on to shoulders.
2. toot back somersault each ; foot back somersault on
to shoulders ; back somersault off.
3. Hand balance on back and half spread.
4. Half back somersault down on to shoulders : somer
sault off. ’
5. Foot back somersault up on to shoulders ; double
band back somersault up ; two spot somersaults on shoul
ders; somersault off.
.Three high, full somersault over the head: somer
sault off.
7. full pirouette out of hands on to shoulders ; jump
shoulder to shoulder ; hack somersault to shoulder : back
somersault off.
8. Turn round, roll up and roll down into porpoises.
Jt
Some of these we’ve invented ourselves ; No. 5
for example. You practise, and ideas come to
you You practise ideas, and they turn into
tricks. Acrobats depend on natural knack, and
perpetual practice. We have been at it since
10 years old : are all circus men—riders and
what not. ihe essence of the acrobats’ game
is two or three men working in unison, work-
ing m time together. Our act goes like a
piece of music: it has to. When the under-
stander lifts, the middleman must spring,
or the lift is not possible. When the middleman
lifts, the topmounter must spring, or again the lift
is not possible. Both working together, one man
can put another on his shoulders without trouble,
if they don't work together, he can’t put a boy
up. Perfect time—perfect time: that’s the
secret. \V hen we have a musical accompaniment,
the music must keep our time. If it plays faster
or slower it throws us out. When you practise,
the time gets printed on your brain. The tricks
become second nature. If you toss a man and
stand to catch him, you stand by instinct in
exactly the right spot. He turns by instinct in
exactly the right time to meet you at that spot.
As he descends, you yield, he springs, and he
lands on your shoulders like a feather. If he or
you stiffened he would knock you down.
Ope day is just as lucky for us as another. We
don’t believe in luck, but we do in heart. Some
days you have confidence (you feel it here: in
your heart, not in your head) : then you can do
anything. Other days you feel frightened of
missing, and then you’re bound to miss. An
acrobat must always be in perfect health. If he
is bilious or worried he knows it at once, and his
mates know it as soon as they touch his hands.
An acrobat s muscles are a bit queer. They get set
for doing acrobats, and for nothing else. We are in
pretty fair condition all of us, yet if we ran 100
yards we would be quite sore next morning. Why?
Because we would be using our muscles the way
they are not trained to go. An acrobat’s muscles
get set one way, a pedestrian’s another, and so
on all round.
We don’t want big, hard muscles, but supple,
pliant ones. They must be lively, with a good
circulation of blood. In cold weather we have
to jump about for five minutes and slap
ourselves to get the blood circulating in the
muscles, otherwise we’d be stiff and get cast in
somersaulting. A cast somersault is a somersault
that goes wrong. The man does not leave quickly
enough or slowly enough, with the result that he
turns too slowly or too quickly, and consequentlv
gets “against time ’’—out of time with the others.
hen you do that at a height, you risk breaking
your neck ; but our topmounter, thanks to knack
and practice, knows exactly where he is in the air
at any part of a somersault, and can hold himself
back or throw himself forward to get in time.
We have never had an accident—not a serious
accident, blight misses now and then, perhaps,
when getting form after a spell, but that's all.
xxt^ 6 r ? ea P® rs too—three double-somersaulters.
We reckon Duckworth is the best double-somer-
saulter m Australia,' although we say it. We
know our game, and we’ve never seen his match.
Treble somersaults are never done, or hardly ever
You risk too much, and the public would n’
appreciate the risk and the difficulty. In a single
somersault you know where you are going all the
time, and see where you are going : you can con-
trol yourself. But in the second somersault you
know nothing, see nothing; it is all black before
your eyes. There’s just an instinct that tells you
not to overthrow or underthrow, and makes you
bring your hands down and land on your feet at
exactly the right moment. The public don’t
understand the difficulty : performers do. A
double-somersault leaper must fix his thoughts on
the spot where he is going to land. He glues his
eyes and his mind to that spot. If he takes his
sight or attention off, he’s bound to miss.
Falls are curious. It’s better to fall fifteen feet
than five, because you get a chance to make ready to
land. In fifteen feet you can turn and land on
your feet every time. When there’s no time to turn,
curl yourself up into a ball, as small as ever you
can, with your knees on your chest, and your arms
round your legs, and your head down between
your knees, and try and land between your
shoulders. That’s your best chance of safety. If
you thrust an arm or leg out it’s almost sure to
break. Duckworth stepped off a kerbstone once,
and broke his arm. Another time he fell fifty
feet and never hurt himself—landed bn his feet,
bowed to the audience, and walked off. Certainly
he was shaken a bit, but it passed off in a week or
two. Heller got on a horse a while ago, and the
brute bucked and tossed him off—tossed him to
just a nice height for a somersault. He turned
in the air and came down on his feet, facing the
horse.
Doing acrobats is a fine game for the health.
We live like anybody else : smoke our pipes, and
have a drink now and again, but nothing too
much. The exercise keeps us in trim. We
could n’t take any other exercise but the game
itself without getting out of trim. If you’ve got
a weedy boy or girl, it’s a splendid thing to make
acrobats of them.
FLOTSAM
An examination of “nerve-foods” was recently
undertaken by A. Gautier, in the course of which
(reports The Atherueum) he experimented upon
the food value of substances like tea, coffee, spices,
beef tea, and alcoholic drinks.
He thinks that the nutritive value of coffee, tea, mate,
and the guar ana. of Brazil is almost nil, but that all these,
by increasing- the circulation-and the output of carbonic
acid by the lungs, help to fret rid of ‘waste products and
to diminish the fatigue of both muscles and brain.
Chocolate, on the other hand, he considers a true food as
well as an excitant, and, as such, far Superior to beef-tea,
although he says it has its own dangers for the rheumatic
and dyspeptic. As to alcoholic drinks, he is altogether in
favour of their moderate use, and points out that within
limits the whole of the alcohol imbibed is burnt within
the organism, and therefore produces none of the ill
effects often attributed to it. On the other hand, the
rapidity of its effect, and the fact that its use enables the
patient to dispense with some portion of sugar, starch,
and fat in his diet, give it special value in certain cases.
The quantity on which he founds his calculation seems
to be about three-fourths of a litre of vin ordinaire per
day.
Someone has been printing conversations with
Walt Whitman, in which the old heretic appears
as critic :
The story writers do not as a rule attract me. Howell
seems to have something to say—James is only feathers
to me. What do you make of them?—What is their
future significance? Have they any? Don’t they just
come and go?—don’t they just skim about, butterfly
about, daintily, in fragile literary vessels, for a while—
then bow their way out ? They do not deal in elements :
they deal only in pieces of things, in fragments broken off,
in detached episodes.
Then he mentioned Stedman again : “ Stedman always
feels that he should be judicial—the dominance of that
principle has held him down from many a noble flight.
Stedman seems so often just about to get off for a long
voyage and stops himself on the" shore. Why shouldn’t
we just let go—let life do its damdest: take every
obstacle out of the way and let it go ? Why should being
thought foolish, or unreasonable, or coarse hold us back ?
We can go nowhere worth while if we submit to the
scorners.”

“ A.L.5.,” in To-Day, says a word for the base
Sassenach :
When, the new Celtic prophet f ~r ns to verse
He writes in English that i j world may heed him,
Because if he expressed his soul in Erse
JVo soul would read him.
Fretful and sore and militant, he brings
Our “ lean, unlovely English ” to his ditty,
While ever through his utterance there rings
A wail of pity.
And the weird things he sings of: Washers and
Weavers, and Peat-Smoke and Spells !
And all the maidens are like driven snow,
And all the men incapable and broody ;
Shadows and ineffectual ghosts, they go
Through lifetime moody.
“Never lend books!” said a book-collector
solemnly to Sterry the rhymer. “See: I ’ll show
you: come into my study. You see that case? —
about 200 volumes. Every book on those shelves
was lent to me ! ”
“What cheese do you prefer?” “Gruyere;
but it does n’t prefer me : I can’t digest it.” Then
how do you manage?” “Oh, I only eat the
holes.”
THE HISTORY OF A CRIME
[N. Lindsay, the well-known Sydney designer
and illustrator, is a member of N.S. W. Art Society
and he sent for hanging at the Society’s present ex
hibition a pen-drawing entitled “A Bacchanal.’
The drawing represents a turfed hillside, with
tangled wood on the right. In the foreground
are three nymphs and a youth, apparently
pausing after a chase: at the back is a group
of dancing figures. Though the composition
and perspective are open to criticism, the
detail is admirable; and the work is un-
doubtedly a rare and beautiful example of pen-
drawing. But the figures are wholly or partially
nude. The nudity is natural nudity, and there is
no “indecent” motive expressed or suggested.
It has been thought elsewhere that the nude
human figure was a fitting subject of art. Ap-
parently it is nob thought so by the hanging
committee of N.S.W. Art Society. So the work
was accepted and hung in deference to its merit,
but because of its nudity it was hung near the
roof of the gallery, where it could scarcely be
viewed except with a telescope. The indignant
artist consequently removed it under the circum-
stances which he relates : —]
To. M. le Bulletin !
CHAPTER i.
Monsieur,
I sent my picture to the Art Society’s exhibition. This
vile institution has been granted a Royal Charter. Why?
No one knows. It is a mystery.
They hung my picture.
They hung it as close to the ceiling as a high man on a
tall ladder could reach.
I was furious : I was angry : I was very much annoyed.
This wretched institution was varnishing its miserable
pictures. M. Watkins was there. This man Watkins is a
short man, but his hair is artistic.
I spoke to this M. Watkins.
I said: “Monsieur; you have hung my picture too
high ! ”
I shouted at him.
He heard me.
This M. Watkins was depressed. He was sad. “Listen 1"
he said : “ I know nothing about it.”
“Nothing?”
“ Nothing.”
“ See M. Smith,” he said. I saw M. Smith.
This Smith, like others of the Society’s committee, is
not an artist. He is the treasurer of this pampered in-
stitution.
“Monsieur, M. Watkins informs me that it is you who
have hung my picture so high 1 ”
M. Smith was vague.
He paltered with me.
He said he thought I desired my picture hung so high.
“ See Lister ! ” said this mysterious man, this M. Smith.
“ This Lister, where is he to be found ? "
“ At the Cafd Francais.”
Good.
He was there, this Lister. At a side table sat one Dap-
lyn, lapping his cafe noir. This man Daplyn is the secre-
tary of this vile institution. He has nothing whatever to
do with this story.
I caught the eye of Monsieur le President Lister.
He quailed.
“Listen !” I shouted. “They say that it is you who
have assassinated my picture 1 ”
“Who?”
“ The committee.”
“Traitors!”
So. I informed this President. I told him that this
treacherous committee, these assassins, had betrayed
him.
M. Lister is a brave man.
I love brave men. I admire them. He was also a kind
man, but fat. He gave me a drink.
One drink.
CHAPTER XI.
In the street I met Monsieur Leist. This M. Leist is a
tall, but clever man. Is he always veracious ?
“Listen!” he said. “They are going to buy your
picture! ”
“ Impossible ! They would need a telescope to find it.”
CHAPTER 111.
I returned to this vile institution.
Messieurs les Artistes were still varnishing. They varnish
well, these artists.
M. Fisher was also there.
This M. Fisher is the paid hireling of this Society.
He was sad, he was morose, he was dejected. He was
alone.
This man instructs the misguided youth of his country
in perspective. My God, what a life 1
He spoke to me.
“ This picture, this beautiful thing, my work—they
have hung it in the darkest place. Again 1”
“ Courage !” I said.
“Bah!”
It seemed to me this M. Fisher wished to tear the
gizzards out of the committee. Especially one gizzard.
Pass, M. Fisher.
CHAPTER IV.
This committee of conspirators was gathered together.
I approached it.
“ Restore the picture ! ” I shouted.
“ Never ! ”
“ Then I will restore it myself I ”
There was a step-ladder there. It was tall, it was high,
it was great. It was magnificent.
This ladder had probably been the means of massacring
my picture.
M. Daplyn stepped forward.
This man, like others of the committee, paints.
What does he paint 2
“ It is terrible,” said M. Daplyn.
“ Why is it terrible ?”
“ Because you have seen them.”
This Daplyn desired me to wait.
I never wait.
I ascended the ladder. They saw me. I tore the picture
down.
The effect was sublime. It was history !
This novel is entirely unnecessary. It is urgent.
Therefore I publish it.

“ R.N.W.” asks for an explanation of A. L.
Gordon’s use of “ Argemone ” as a title for verses
reprinted in The Bulletin, 20th Oct., 1894. Arge-
mone is the botanical name of “a small genus of
papaveracece, sometimes found with the aspect of
thistles and the flowers of poppies”— papaver
argemone, the common poppy, symbol of the last
sleep and oblivion. Thus “Argemone” reflects
the mood and message of Gordon’s lines in
question.
Printed that an Amer. (of course) publisher
found himself with 20,000 unsaleable copies of a
Natural History. What did that Amer. publisher
do ? He stripped 20,000 covers off, re-issued the
book as God’s Wonders in the Animal Creation,
sold it out, and...is still publishing fresh editions.

SOMETHING NOVEL
A novelty in »22 caliber* rifles. As its name indicates, the trig-
ger, located upon the upper side of the grip at the rear of the
bolt, is operated by pressing down with the thumb, thus obvi-
ating “pull off" in firing. Simplicity and quickness of action
are its features. It is a take-down, and has the widely imi-
tated Winchester bolt action. Notwithstanding its low price,
its v quality is the same as that of all Winchester rifles.

HANS PETER RASMUSSEN,
LEARN FROM OTHERS’ EXPERIENCE
The Case of
Mr. E. VV. OAVIS.
(By a Sydney .Reporter.)-
ft is safe to say that the people
ivho have the most vital interest, m
the following particulars are. those who
find themselves in a similar position
to that occupied some seven years ago
by Mr. Edward Walter Davis, painter,
of Henwickstreet. Marrickville; who
addressed these remarks to an inter-
viewer :
"It was whilst 1 was Jiving at
Leichhardt that 1 was so ill with
painters' colic, and also rheumatism,
and J can give you my word that for
several months it was a doubtful mat-
ter liow things would go with me.
Both those complaints at once would
be enough to kill most men, aiid it
is no exaggeration to say that they
nearly caused my death. My digestive
organs were also in a terribly bad
way, so that, you see, I was suffering
Irom a serious complication of ail-
ments."
"Did you seek medical advice, Mr.
Davis ?’
"Oh, yes ; 1 saw a doctor, and for
some time remained under n.s treat-
ment. which, unfortunately, proved to
be utterly useless. 1 took enough
medicines to do me good in those
days if they had been of tho right
kind, but evidently they were not,
and the agony 1 was continually suf-
fering was simply intolerable. The
rheumatic pains in my legs had quite
a crippling effect upon-me, for 1 had to
refrain from moving about as much as
possible because of any exertion ag-
gravating my aflhctions. Nearly all
my joints were as stiff and sore as
could be, so you can imagine how r dif-
ficult it was for me to do anything;
but so far as doing anything was
concerned I hadn't the inclination, for
I felt as if the whole world had closed
its doors against me. In my melan-
choly frame of mind 1 could see no-
thing excepting in the gloomiest of
colours, and all there seemed in this
life 'vas to struggle hopole sly along
against overwh l mng adve.s.ties. Had
i been told that in a short while 1
was going to die I’m sure it would
have been good news, for 1 was re ally-
aii.vi ous to leave all my unhappiness
behind me.”
"It seems as if you had come to the
conclusion that you were not going
to get better 7”
‘‘lndeed, J. could think nothing else,
because I could not get even a little
relief. Mv agonies had me worked up
to such a pitch of exasperation that
if anybody came and spoke to me I
could scarcely bo civil to them. And
wnat, fearful nights I put in week af-
ter wee-.; ! frequently no sleep from
tho time I w'ent to bed till I got up
again next day, and I’d like to know
who could have got to sleep if they
I ml felt- as I did, with the sensation
in my stomach as if everything was
being drawn up into a knot and then
screwed round and round. Combined
with these afflictions 1 had pains un-
der my heart, which caused me more
anxiety than enough, for what chan e
had J. of e fleet mg a recovery if l hau
heart disease as well, and the way
i - ipitation occurred made me think
that- organ was diseased. This was
not all, though, as my chest had
heavy pains in it which affected my
breathing, and not a day passed but
what I was nearly distracted with a
headache. If I took a small quantil
of food—and my appetite ivas too
poor to cat much—it simply turned
sour in the stomach and gave rise
to lits of belching, and a feeling as
if 1 wanted to be sic:; would come on.
Oh, there was no child's play about
my illness, and I of lea say what a
lucky man 1 was ever to get rid of
it.”
"That, is what 1 would like to hear
about. Do you mind telling me ?”
“Not at all. i am only too gla'l
for it was such a wonderful affair, as
most of the neighbours round where I
lived could tell you. They knew how
1 suffered, and when they saw that I
was being pulled round they were very
curious to know what was the cause
of it, and .1 told them Clements Tonic
was the medicine that was saving my
life, which was the truth. Besides
what I’ve alreadv stated, f used to
get feelings of giddiness very often
and my tongue was never c.ean, but
covered with slime, and in my mouth
the taste was like bile ; but when i
had taken a couple of bottles or so of
Clements Tonic 1 was not a bit like
that, and the old feelings of sickness
alter eating were gone. That was a
good deal to be grateful for, but. no-
thing compared to what followed, i
used to dream a lot whenever .1 ob-
tained some sleep, and would wane
up in terror as if 1 had been dream-
ing of murder or something equa.iy
bad, but Clements Tonic had such a
calming effect upon me that when 1
slept 1 did so soundly, and felt as
fresh as paint when I woke up. My
nerves might have had a lot to do
with those restless nights, for before
using Clements Tonic they, used to
twitch dreadfully; afterwards they
were lirm and steady, and the little
involuntary jumps I used to give when
lying down were no longer in evi-
dence. 1 was not the same man at
all when I had been taking Clements
lonic a few weeks. The acute rheu-
matic pains had. been gradually be-
coming less and less painful, and in
good time they died out altogether.
Buch a thing might seem impossible,
but, on my honour, it is true, and
when 1 speak of the colic pains I can
say exactly the same thing—they were
done away with ov Clements' Tonic
once and for all. Many of my work-
mates have reaped the benefit, of my
experience, for when I have told them
what cured me they got Clements
Tonic for themselves, and they have
always spoken of the resuhs in satis-
factory terms.’’
“And how did your digestive organs
fare ?”
“Couldn’t possibly have been made
more healthy than Clements Tonic
made them, which means all the dif-
ference between a life of joy and a
life of sorrow. JLt meant that my eyes
were no longer heavy and dull as
they had been, and it meant that 1
could always eat heartily without fear
of being ill afterwards, for Clements
Tonic made my internal organs do
their work more perfectly than ever.
That 1 had got very tain could only
be expected, but under the treatment
of Clements Tonic 1. soon put on more
flesh than 1 had before my illness, and
the additional strength 1 acquired was
amazing. My wife was also very ill
once, and Clements Tonic did tier a
wonderful amount of good, which
shows that it can bo usod equally well
by either sex, to whom 1 umailingly
recommend its use when circumstances
require.”

versation V”

Various Verses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Not a Pay Chute.
Did e’er you try to write a glittering verse,
To dress some threadbare theme in diction neater
To snare a laggard thought that stumbles worse
The more you try to knock it into metre ?
Then drop the pen and walk outside and curse
The luck that didn’t make your brain completer ;
And then walk back to court the rhythmic prude,
Wearing a smile of forced beatitude ?
You try a dozen dull, discordant strings;
You strike the tambourine without a jingle—
Your muse won’t flap a feather of her wings,
No bright spark burns within her ashy ingle ;
As dry as dust the jade’s Pierian springs—
As barren, tunefully, as mountain shingle,
As dumb as stone, as silent as the sky—
No voice that rings, no laugh, not e’en a sigh.
And yet, behind to-morrow’s bill-of-fare,
Uplooms a note of large interrogation
(A man must glue himself upon the chair
When hash depends on rhyming inspiration).
You struggle with the ghosts of dead rhymes there
And clutch the pen in utter desperation.
Though lights be dim and fancy ashen white,
For business reasons you-must sing to night.
If yet unscathed, pray cast your baited hook
In other streams, where efforts find fruition—
Take up the church, or learn to make a “book, *
Or be a bi-metallic politician ;
Or join the “force,” and commandeer the cook—
Such aims allure a sentient ambition.
But don’t touch ink—the devil's in the pot;
It also holds the worm that dieth not.
W. A.
BLUEBUSH.
In the Firelight.
My tender-toned guitar,
There’s an accent faint and far,
A soft “ Carissima ” that’s like the echo of a bell
Resounding from the shade .
Where the “ far away ” is laid
With a fairy tinkle tinkle ringing Fancy to its
dell.
Hist! at the dulcet call,
Steps my lady through the hall,
And the canvas frame-us emptied of its winsome
little flower;
A miniature of grace
As from the laughing face
Two flashing gems of mischief rob the diamond of
its power.
And the bright eyes dance with joy
As I yield her back her toy,
While she twangs with lissome fingers the all-
responsive strings;
Aye, more attuned are they
To the rhythm of her day ;
In a peal of muffled merriment the quaint old
measure rings.
My lady, why that flush,
Too dainty for a blush,
Just mid-tint, ’tween the shades o’ rose Love’s
subtle brushes trace ?
Aha ! a lover’s there
Beside her oaken chair —
Ihe courtly type of Chivalry which scorns our
ruder race.
And like a play rehearsed,
The pretty scene’s reversed,
She steps a graceful measure as he takes the old
guitar ;
And mine eyes grow dim and wet,
As the dear old minuet
Throbs lightly through the shadows with its soft
“Carissima.” -
And now it’s only meet
That he’s kneeling at her feet
To court my dainty lady in the good, old-fashioned
way;
Till their pantomime of bliss
Makes its exit —with a kiss.
As the shadows o’er the picture fling a dingy veil
o’ gray
But there echoes through the mist
A wedd i rig peal I wist,
“ Carissima, Carissima,” hark sweet the joy tones
blend;
And there’s a bridal ring,
And white wreathed children sing
Across thy frets o’ harmony, mine antiquated
friend.

The Thrush.
Hear the happy thrush
In the elder bush !
How content he flits about,
Not a note of pain or doubt,
Glad in mate, and nestlings too,
Sunlit trees, and cloudless blue ;
Listen to the thrush
In the elder bush.
Were my skies so blue,
Thrush, I might sing too ;
But my song is all forgot,
Desolate my garden plot.
I h ive nothing left but tears,
Fading hopes, and greying years—
“ Hark !” they cry—“ The thrush !”
In the elder bush.
“With the thrush be gay,”
Tender voices say ;
And indeed I strive and try,
But my song sinks i.i a sig..
Brooding over bygone springs
Helnless fill mv broken wings ;
Yet he sings, the thrush
In the elder bush !

MARK TWAIN writes:—
“ The only needful thing is to get
Plasmon into the stomach - dis-
solved, or in clods, or petrified, or
any way, so it gets there. I had
an eight years persistent dispute
v/ith dyspepsia, but my doctor
ordered Plasmon to be added to
my other food, and I have had
no return of it since.”
THE LANCET says: “ The addition of Plasmon to ordinary
food raises the nutritive value enormously,” and
is particularly useful in cases of fever, extreme
exhaustion, Bright’s disease, diabetes, chorea,
mal-nutrition, and wasting diseases.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
mm
MEDICATOR.
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
the sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try

them. It is to people who have part or all of these symp-

Mouth Organs
The "Crackajack" illustrated below presents not only the very latest improvements,
but is unquestionably the best and most beautiful toned Mouth Organ made.
The Reeds are of best bell metal alloy, tuned by experts. The frames
are of thoroughly seasoned hardwood, the re£d plates are solid
brass, and every reed tongue is securely riveted. The
Tone is perfected by a system of voicing the
reeds, which makes it rich and powerful
in volume, and the reeds are
subjected to a process of
special tuning, so that
each note through-
out the entire
register is ab-
solutely perfect
The covers are
of heavy brass,
heavily plated and
artistically engrav-
ed. It is impossible

A HANDFUL OF LOCOMOTIVES.
At time of writing, the bitter scrimmage about
the manufacture in N.S. W. of some locomotives for
use on the N.S.W. railways still continues. It is
a job about the size of a fly, and is calculated, if
spread over three years, to employ an average of
130 men and boys for that period. That the locomo-
tives should be made in the State every intelligent
Australian, who has a patriotic desire to see his
country advance in art, science and industry, is
agreed, but this handful of engines doesn’t
represent one-thousandth part of the question
really at issue. They will amount, it may
be, to an outlay of £300,000, much of it for
i mported materials, which outlay, if spread over
the period mentioned, is equal to £lOO,OOO a
year—this in a State which spends close on
£12,000,000 a year on imports, and sends
away £12,000,000 a year to support foreign
industries. Yet, so bitter is the hostility of the
Sydney Foreign-trade press against Australian
industries, that over this mere semblance of a bit
of work—a matter which is only equal to about an
inch in the miles of progress that should be made
annually—a battle has raged for years, and is still
raging. These few pathetic locomotives—which,
after all, will, to a great extent, only represent
the fitting together of imported ironwork—loom
so large now that when it is decided to make them
locally there will be a tendency, even among the
patriotic section of the N.S.W. people, to sit
down, and draw a long breath, and thank Heaven
that the battle is won and the country is saved.
A fine example of this tendency may be seen in a
recent letter written to Tiie Bulletin by Holman,
M.L.A., m which this one petty contract was put
forward as an evidence that the Labor party is
neither dead nor sleeping in its desire to push for-
ward national industries. There are said to be
30,000 unemployed to-day in N.S.W.—the figures
may or may not be correct. The money sent away
last year to support foreign industries was, as
already mentioned, close on £12,000,000. The
amount borrowed last year to keep up some sem-
blance of prosperity in N.S.W. was within a few
pounds of £2,300,000. And yet it is of so much
more importance to the Sydney Telegraph push
to prevent £1 worth of work being done in the
country than to avoid going £23 into debt that
these things attract hardly any attention, while
the riot that circles round the railway loco, ques-
tion is like a whirlwind in Tophet,
* * * *
Victoria has been building its locomotives—and
building them, to a much greater extent than N.S.
Wales ever attempted, out of its own materials—
for years. It has done this under a system of Pro-
tection which, in this case, amounted to Prohibi-
tion. The foreigner wasn’t simply handicapped
by a duty ; he was ruled out altogether. At first
locomotive building at the Victorian State work-
shops was a more expensive affair than it is now.
Experience had to be acquired, and while it is
being acquired there is a chance of the first crop
of locomotives being a failure, just as there is of
the first crop of potatoes. But now that the pre-
liminary difficulties have been overcome the Vic-
torian Government workshops can beat private
enterprise, foreign and local, on its own ground.
Within the last year or two they have managed,
while paying good wages and working reasonable
hours, to reduce the cost per locomotive from
£3364 (which was itself a great reduction on pre-
vious figures) to £3048. The Victorian State
workshops can now produce locomotives more
cheaply than they can be imported, and this is
the result of the accumulation of years of experi-
ence, of the economy which comes of experience,
and of the further economy which comes
through working on a large scale. And
it was the shutting out of the foreigner,
and the concentration of the bulk of the work
in these workshops, which enabled work to be con-
ducted on the large scale which makes economy
possible. But if Victoria had followed the
theories of the N.S.W. Foreign-traders, and never
commenced work until it could, without experi-
ence, compete against the world, it would never
have commenced at all, any more than the indi-
vidual who never goes into the water until he can
swim never gets wet.
* * * *
The Sydney Telegraph calculates wildly that
if N.S.W. builds 60 locomotives locally at its State
workshops, that preliminary job will cost £40,000
more than 60 imported locomotives would. It is
just possible that it would. Also it is possible
that the next 60 would cost £20,000 more
than the imported price, and the third lot
quite/as much as the imported price. The
Foreign-trade rag, whose hatred of Australian
manufactures, and of any Australian pro-
gress which comes of manufactures, amounts
to frenzy, only adopts this attitude, however,
when manufactures are concerned. When, in-
stead of it being a question of preventing the loss
of even 130 Australian workmen and their
families by finding employment for them, it is a
question of importing at public cost 130 of the
agricultural scum of Europe and their families, the
matter assumes quite a different aspect. In such
a case it would be pointed out that an able-bodied
citizen is supposed to be worth at least £lOO to the
country of his adoption; this calculation is
always applied to the man who shoves the plough
but never, by the Foreign-trade press, to the man
who makes the plough. Then it would be set forth
that the expenditure of, perhaps, £6OOO on the pas-
sage-money of th ese agriculturists an d their families,
the spending of many thousands more to provide
them with land, and of many more thousands in
after years to carry their produce to the port of
shipment at about a quarter of the actual cost of
carriage, was all money well laid out because
it would develop an industry. Meanwhile the
spending of a penny to develop a manufacturing
industry is held to be utterly accursed. The agri-
culturist is never expected to pay his way—even
now the hay, corn, and chaff industry, after a cen-
tury of progress, is subsidised to the extent of
between £300,000 and £400,000 a year on N.S.W.
railways by having its products carried below
cost, and it has been subsidised for a full century
by exemption from local rates and taxes. The
manufacturer, unless he can Work his own
passage from the outset, paying far higher
wages than the agriculturist for far shorter
hours, paying, in many cases, nearly ten times the
freights the agriculturist pays, paying local rates
and taxes from which the agriculturist is exempt,
and paying special taxes to provide the agricul-
turist’s road and bridge and culvert—unless he can
do all this and hold his own against all outside
competition, he has to go under, or if he asks for a
fraction of aid he is denounced as a parasite, a
cormorant, and something akin to Barabbas.
And when the agriculturist is specially subsi-
dised in about two dozen ways it is mentioned as
a set-off that at least, by paying to get him on the
land and to keep him on the land, the country
gains a citizen, a taxpayer, and a prospective
defender. Yet when it is proposed to aid the
establishment of a manufacturing industry the
fact that the brawny iron-worker is also a citizen,
and a prospective defender of the country, and a
much better tax-payer than the cocky, is never set
down to his credit.
* * It *
N.S.W. is now mixed up in an agitation for
giving another gigantic subsidy to agriculture—
paying the passages of agricultural immigrants,
giving them land, lending them money, and
exempting them for a number of years from the
almost infinitesimal taxes that the agricultural
community is supposed to pay. This in addition
to the indirect subsidies that come in the form
of railway rebates. All this is held to be
justified, and may be justified, on the ground
that the country requires population to provide
for its defence that the country does
require population is beyond question. Mean-
while the Victorian experiment at locomotive
building—though it is a pathetically small
instalment of the iron industry that the
country should have goes to prove that
great manufacturing industries could be built up
with a mere fraction of the aid that is so cheer-
ily given in N.S.W. to prop up the hay, corn,
and chaff job. But with the Foreign-trade press
and the Foreign-trade politician, manufactures—
•xcept the manufacture of beer which N.S.W.
has always protected lavishly—are accursed,
and things to be slandered and undermined
in every possible way and on every possible
occasion. So it comes to pass that N.S.W. has
made more disturbance and aroused more frenzied
discussion over the proposed construction of a few
locomotives than a progressive counfry, which was
not cursed with a Sydney Telegraph, might have
made over the establishment of a permanent iron
industry worth £10,000,000, over the building of a
new navy, and over the establishment of a dozen
new trades. The United States has almost doubled
its iron output while N.S.W. has been haggling over
these few locomotives, and Canada has added
14,000,000 dollars a year to its exports of nianu-
factured goods—the increase in its production of
manufactured goods has been vastly greater-
while the problem of employing about 130 men in
the temporary job of putting together a few tanks
on wheels has torn the Cornstalk community
asunder. If this rate of progress is maintained,
the real Australian iron industry, and most other
Australian industries, and the first material in-
ynnnSe m Aust ™lian population are due in about
oUUO years, and the invader, from whatever direc-
tion he m ry come, is due much sooner than that.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Several Inquiries for ’Possum Skins.
One of the small surreptitious devices whereby
the mostly Freetrade State of N.S.W. subsidises
its ‘‘primary” industries is the appointment of
“commercial agents” to hustle in foreign lands
for orders for the country’s “primary products.”
The artisan is taxed to pay for this, of course, just
as he is taxed to pay for the cocky’s roads, bridges
and culverts, the carriage of his produce at a
fraction of cost, his seed wheat in bad seasons, and
all the rest of his aids, bonuses and benefits. But
the commercial agent does something for his
money. He is not altogether wasted or altogether
lost. In evidence whereof the following paragraph
proudly lifted up its tail the other day in the
Sydney daily papers :
The Commercial Agent in South Africa, in a report to
the Minister for Agriculture, states that he has recently
had several inquiries for ’possum skins and rugs
That at least shows that the Freetrade policy
of N.S.W. has not wholly lived in vain. The
State may be practically devoid of iron works,
brass works, machinery shops, steel works, rolling
mills, zinc distilleries, worsted, woollen, cotton,
silk and jute factories, railway carriage and loco-
motive works, whisky mills, chemical works, arms
and ammunition factories and shipbuilding yards;
it may hardly know how to make its own hats,
boots, buttons, glass, fencing wire, mackintoshes,
umbrellas and socks; it may import its locks,
window fastenings, boot laces and manures; and
it may have 30,000 unemployed and owe nearly
£83,000,000, and have the biggest accumulated
deficit in Australasia —but its ’possum industry is
still sound. In that respect it is as far advanced
as Nimrod, who was a mighty hunter; and Esau,
who was a hairy man and ran swiftly after wild
beasts through the thickets of Genesis. The’possum
skin is worth at least ninepence, and though the
’possum is growing rather scarce, still, when you
find him, he is all there, unless he gets away. And
several of the beastie have been inquired about—
how many isn’t stated, but if the number should
happen to be ten then there have been inquiries
about 7s. Gd. worth of ’possum. The matter is of
such importance that a big city daily gives it a
special paragraph. It shows that N.S.W. isn’t
wholly ruined and utterly dead through following
the Sydney Telegraph’s policy. Canada may
put on blatant airs because it exports about fifty
million dollars’ worth annually of manufactured
goods (in fact, Canada’s export of manufactured
goods exceeds its export of agricultural produce),
but N.S.W. can at least say that its ’possum has
been inquired about. And if that ninepenny
animal puts its head out of its hole on a moon-
light night, it knows what is liable to happen to
it. The march of a Freetrade State’s progress is
not to be stopped with impunity. N.S.W. has
spent £83,000,000 of loan money to develop its
great natural resources, and provided the imported
gun goes off, and the imported cartridge isn’t
damp, there will be a dead ’possum around one of
these days as sure as fate.
The Frozen Local Government Scheme.
The attitude of the N. S.W. Labor party re
Premier Carruthers’ Local Government scheme
has been, in the main, a disappointment. That
party has put Local Government conspicuously on
its programme, apparently as a matter of habit,
for all parties do that kind of thing, but it hasn’t
shown the slightest enthusiasm for the article
when it came in sight. It has even allowed a
prominent member of the party to denounce the
whole Local Government policy. If he had
denounced in similar fashion any of the purely
labor planks of the platform he would have been
expelled on his ear, but the Local Government
plank, and the plank whereby the party pledges
itself against any further borrowing except for
works which will pay interest and sinking fund,
are, it Would seem, things that any member may
spit upon with impunity. This sort of thing creates
the bad impression that the Labor party is, after all,
a purely pick and shovel party, and thatanything in
its programme which isn’t' exclusively pick-and-
shovel is put there for ornament rather than for
use. Premier Carruthers’ Bill isn’t nearly so
democratic in some respects as it should be, which
is a good reason for amending it in committee—
not for freezing out the whole Local Government
system. In one or two other respects—notably in
providing for the levying of rates on unimproved
land values, and in setting forth that all munici-
pal loans must have a sinking fund attached—it is
strikingly democratic; but though these points-
are, or are supposed to be, strictly in accord with
the Labor policy, the party hasn’t yet offered
Carruthers butter on a lordly dish on account of
them. So far as can be estimated from the things
the party has said and those it has left unsaid,
however its vote may go, its sentiments go mostly
with the Owk’Sullivan in this matter. It has a
pathetic regard for the disastrous Owe’Sullivan,
chiefly, it would appear, because he contemptuously
kicked into the gutter its alleged principle of
spending loan money only oh thoroughly produc-
tive works; because.he was willing to do a good
turn to everybody out of loan money; and because
he loved to be a fussy, pottering Father of the
Country out of loan money, and a deputy Provi-
dence who went round and put everything right
personally out of loan money. Owe’Sullivan, in
whom the roads and bridges politician and the
little culvert jobber reach their highest state ( f
development, is against all Local Government,
because, under a really efficient Local Govern-
ment system, there is no room for the Minister
who buzzes like a benevolent blue-bottle round
the country, doing friendly repairs for everybody
out of loan money. Just for this reason Local
Government is a question on which the Labor
party can’t afford to know of the existence of
Owe’Sullivan. It should regard him as tem-
porarily dead.
♦
The Federal Bookkeeping Nuisance.
Now that the bookkeeping period in the Federal
accounts, as that period was originally fixed,
comes near an end, Tasmania begins to run a
strong agitation against any perpetuation of the
system. The device in question provides that a
careful separate account shall be kept of the
Federal revenue derived from each State, and,
after charging each State with its own share of the
cost of government, the six surpluses are worked
out with mathematical accuracy and handed back.
The Tasmanian idea is that the ink, paper, worry
and anguish of all this separate account-keeping
shall be spared, and that the Commonwealth
should simply collect all the revenue it can get,
and be darned glad to get it ; should spend as
little as possible, and divide the surplus among
the States, according to their population—so
much per head. The idea has more to
recommend it than appears on the surface;
it is not so unfair as it looks, nor is the
present method nearly so fair as it looks. When
the Commonwealth’s statistical department gets
into working order, and is ready to supply each
year an official estimate of the population of each
State, on which estimate the surplus can be
divided, it would certainly be far better to adopt
the rough and ready method of allotting the cash
balance by population—until the State debts are
taken over and there is no more balance to divide.
The bookkeeping method was adopted principally
because, when Federation commenced, Westralia
was on the top wave of its great loan-drunk, as
well as its gold-drunk ; and its customs revenue!
per head was so much larger than that of an-
other State that a division of the surplus accord-
ing to population would have deprived it of more
than a third of its income. The fact that Wes-
tralia was allowed to maintain for five years a
diminishing tariff against the other States
was also on account of the abnormal con-
ditions arising from its loan and gold
drunk. All that is changed now. The
special Westralian tariff will soon expire. The
Westralian customs revenue is fast getting down
to the general level ; there is every reason to
believe that, by the time its special tariff expires,
it will be down to the general level. When it
arrives there, or about there, the book-keeping
system will be only an excrescence—in fact, it will
be more of a curse than an excrescence. Of course
some States would receive a little more, and some
a little less, under the proposed method than
under the system of returning to each State its
own exact surplus, but the discrepancy would be
more apparent than real. As a matter of fact, it
is often the State which gets least under the book-
keeping system which deserves to get most. A
State which buys from its neighbors the things
which it doesn’t produce itself, and by so
doing encourages Australian industry, loses
revenue under the bookkeeping system. If
it bought the goods it doesn’t produce from
Germany instead of from another Australian
State, and encouraged German industry in-
stead. of the industry of its next neighbor,
then it would be credited with customs duties on
these German goods, and would gain much cash
income, while it gets no customs revenue on the
goods it buys from another State. A system
which in any way encourages a State to help
foreign industry instead of the industry of its
own Australian neighbor is wholly vicious. More-
over the I ederal tendency should be, wherever
possible, to know nothing about the existence of
separate States, and one way in which it is pos-
sible to ignore the existence of separate States is
to give up keeping separate State accounts and
save the cost of these accounts. Every true Aus-
tralian should keep his eye on Unification as the
goal to be reached sooner or later, and even the
smallest step towards that goal is something
gained.
»
The Customs Administration.
The present Australian Government has given
effect to some valuable reforms in Customs
administration which should tend to purify trade,
(Not without reason did the ancients assign the
same tutelary deity to Commerce and to Lying.
The two sometimes seem to be twin brothers.)
The Australian Customs revenue and the Aus-
tralian manufacturer have for long been victims of
a very ingenious system of fraud as regards imports
from America. In that land the great manufactur-
ing enterprises are in most cases allied with
privately-owned railroads. The trust which deals
in oil or beef or machinery almost always owns
enough stock in the railway lines it mostly uses to
control the traffic management. This fact was
used to take down the Australian Customs. Our
tariff regulations counted the value, for Customs
purposes, of an article as the port of shipment
value—less the freight and other charges from its
place of manufacture to the port of shipment, and
plus 10 p.c. for ocean freightage. To explain,
with an entirely supposititious case. An axe made
in Chicago and shipped from San Francisco was
valued for duty at the ’Frisco price less the cost of
conveyance from Chicago to ’Frisco. The Ameri-
can manufacturer, working in with his allied rail-
road, was able to quote the ’Frisco price at 45., and
the cost of freight, insurance, commission, and ex-
change from Chicago to ’Frisco at Is. 9d.; value for
Customs purposes thus 2s. 3d. As a matter of honest
fact the c.i.f. & e. charges from Chicago to
’Frisco would be only 9d. But by overstating
them—a proceeding made possible -by collusion
with the railway co.—invoices were secured for
Customs purposes at far below the real value of
the article. Now all that is to be changed. In
future the Customs duty will be charged on the
on-board-ship price at the port of foreign ship-
ment, and no allowances will be made for railway
freight from the factory to that port. It is calcu-
latated that this reform will bring in to the
Treasury some £50,000 a year in extra revenue, and
will, at the same time, relieve Australian manufac-
turers of an unfair and dishonest competition. In
some cases the rate of Protection accorded by the
tariff to an Australian industry was reduced one
half by this ingenious faking. Whilst engaged in
the good work of administrative reform, the Aus-
tralian Government should consider the incidence
of the softgoods duties. An examination of the
invoices will show that there is an enormous
amount of “dumping” in softgoods. Fabrics
which have gone out of fashion, or have remained
over from their proper season, are shipped to Aus-
tralia invoiced at prices which do not represent
their intrinsic value but their “ sacrifice ” dump
price. So the Australian cloth-maker, who is
supposed to get a 15 per cent. Protection, in
reality has that very low tariff rate cut down
seriously by the invoice price of dumped goods.
The Argentine Customs system, of giving a specific
value to articles about the honest price of which
there is no doubt, would meet the case. It could,
for instance, be provided that flannel is worth, or
should be worth, so much a yard. If invoiced at
less, either the invoice is dishonest or the fabric
is. In either case, no grievance could be alleged
if the duty were charged on a fair flannel price.
The same could apply to tweeds, and other fabrics.
The dumping-importer can always be impaled on
one horn of the dilemma. If his stuff is honest,
then his invoice isn’t, and the price for duty must
come up. If his invoice is honest, then his stuff
isn’t, and as it is shoddy masquerading as some-
thing else, it deserves no favorable consideration.

The Bear’s Revolution.
The Russian revolution, if it is a revolution, drags
along in a strangely unsatisfactory way. It seems
to have no centre and no leaders, and it flickers
out at one place and blazes up disconnectedly at
another till it is hard to say where it is. Outwardly
it is a mixture of strike, agrarian riot, mutiny,
casual shooting, casual dynamite, casual arson,
revolutionary meetings and press agitation, and
the throwing of road metal, firewood and dead
cats at those who are clothed in a little brief
authority. Report lias it that in some districts
the land-owning nobility is gathering up its jewels
and its best clothes and fleeing to Sweden and
Germany, as the French nobility fled when
the throne of Louis XVI. began to totter;
but there seems to be little authentic
information. The great army still faces


Otama in Manchuria, regardless of the
fact that its own house is said to be burning behind
it, and there is no news of mutiny there as yet.
Whether, if peace were made, that army would
come back to Europe in a friendly spirit to prop
up the throne, or whether it would come back
with murder in its eye and hang grand dukes on
lamp-posts, no one knows. Meanwhile, the Czar
has made a feeble attempt to pacify his subjects
by the offer of a species of Parliament which he
reserves the right to abolish again in five years or
less, and he also reserves the right to cut any
session short if he feels that way. The press
seems to have intimated, almost to the last rag,
that this mirthful jest of a Constitution is not the
thing it wants ; apparently the old rigorous cen-
sorship has broken down, and the press is
speaking to its Romanoff as he has never
been spoken to before. Yet with all this there
is no visible leader, no insurgent army, and
no convention or junta of revolutionists. No city
flies the flag of revolt and is openly its centre, as
Puebla was of the Mexican Liberals and Rochelle
of the French Huguenots. If the Russian move-
ment is a revolution its strength lies in its very
intangibleness—there is no head to be cut off,
no city to be taken, no camp to be stormed.
If there is a commander no one appears to know
him. What progress is being made, so far as can
be ascertained, arises chiefly from the growing
weariness and paralysis of Authority, which, no
matter where it turns, finds opposition dying away
in front and is struck by a clod from behind. The
constant falling of clods may wear away an
emperor and 30 grand dukes in course of time.
And Authority has got to a point at which,
while its servants still seem to be obedient, it is
afraid to give orders because any one order is
liable to be the last straw on the back of disci-
pline, and then half-a-million armed men may
coldly answer “Rats,” and throw off their
allegiance. But while the Russian movement, if
regarded as a revolution, is like no other in his-
tory, not even the confused scramble of the
Fronde, yet if it isn’t a revolution, it is also not
exactly like anything else in history. And, sup-
posing a real and successful revolution to develop
out of the present undefinableness, no one seems to
have any sound theory as to whether it will result in
the creation of a new Russia, which, like the new
France of a century ago, will rise in its fresh
young might and wallop Europe, or whether it
will mean a breakage of old Russia into its origi-
nal component parts, and a fresh deal all round.
Russia, just now r , is either drunk, or is making his-
tory, or is in some third condition that is difficult
to define.

A Souvenir of Federation.
It is an ill wind-bag that blows along no good.
The undignified fuss that Joseph Car ruthers. of
.N.&. Wales, has been making over the Federal
capital question has had the good result of dragging
to the public light some interesting official cor-
respondence of the days when Federation was
dawning and the “ pulse of the people was
throbbing with the new and noble impulse of
fraternal union ” (see contemporary oratory),
this correspondence raged round the great ques-
tions of landing and housing the Governor-
General. The N.S. Wales political pulse was
throbbing with a noble impulse to drag the G.-G.
to Sydney as the first port of call, so that his foot
should not be contaminated by any other Aus-
tralian soil before he blessed Sydney with his pre-
sence. So it was suggested that at Albany his
mail steamer should be stopped by a man-o’-war
which should hale him straight off to Sydney,
escaping the pollution of any other Australian
port on the way. The official letter in which the
Nr g a neral for . the g reat Mother State of
IN. S. W ales, at the instance of his Premier, urged
tins on the Secretary of State for the Colonies, is
a perfectly adequate explanation for every haw ”
of loathly contempt that the Englishman inflicts
on these “Colonies.” Mr. Copeland wrote :
Nou may rely upon the Colonies contributing their
share of the Imperial spirit if the Home Government
assists in the only manner apparently possible—viz., by
bringing to our shores their and our connecting link, the
Vice-regal representative of the British Empire, with that
amount of State ceremony as can only be conferred by
the use of one of Her Majesty’s ships 'on the occasion ;
whereas little eclat could be given to the event should the
Governor-General land from an ordinary mail steamer in
which any person, at the cost of £l6, could travel as a
steerage passenger. Moreover, His Excellency would
s 'j?Pb' be worried to death should he call in at Albany,
Adelaide, and Melbourne, before arriving at Sydney.
That the event is one in which one of Her Majesty’s
ships might well, and without loss of dignitv, take part,
inasmuch as such an occasion has never in British history
before arisen, nor is it likely ever to arise again. That
the welding together of 4,000,000 British subjects under
the Crown is an event that Her Gracious Majesty herself,
as well as Her Majesty’s Imperial Government, may con-
template with a considerable degree of pride and pleasure,
and when the territory embraced within the Federation
is glanced at, it will be seen what immense possibilities
tor the expansion of the British nation are presented.
-the compact and ocean-girt continent of Australia,
includmg the ear-drop of Tasmania, represents over one-
eighteenth part of the land surface of the world.
And so on ad nauseam. Imperial spirit, eclat, £l6
steerage passenger, worried to death, Her Gracious
Majesty, the ocean girt continent, the ear drop of
Tasmania !! Alas for our bleeding country so put
to derision by its officers in high places ! And the
then Premier iof N.S.W. (Mr. Lyne, who has
learned to be a better Australian since) approved
j that sort of thing violently—indeed, went out
ot his way to compliment Mr. Copeland on his
distinguished services in hustling around the
British State departments to see that the G.-G.
was sent off to Sydney without risking deteriora-
j;! 0 " by a call at any other Australian port. What
the JN.S. W. State Premier had in his mind at the
tmae when Australia was quickening to national
lite can be seen by these telegrams :

refer to. It was with such yeast working in their
minds that prominent politicians stood by at the

were of somewhat different spirit. But even now
quite a number of N. S. Wales citizens get
violently excited over Joseph Carrutiiers’ calcu-
lations as to the number of times Lord Northcote
sleeps at Sydney Government House !
Wanted—A Hews Adulteration Act.
Reading the Hansard report of the debates in
the Australian Parliament on the Commerce Bill
No. 2, suggests that it would be a good thing for
the States, which all have Food Adulteration
Acts, to extend the principle a little farther, and
enact News Adulteration Acts. It doesn’t do
people much more harm, in their capacity as citi-
zens, to eat strawberry jam made from tomatoes,
or to drink whisky which is only methy-
lated spirit, than it does to read the garbled
accounts of the proceedings of the Federal Parlia-
ment which appear in the Sydney Telegraph
under the heading of “In ‘Federal Session.”
The Commerce Bill —about the contents of which
the Federal press lies so strenuously—is, in all its
essential principles, a wholly desirable and neces-
sary measure. It proposes to give the Govern-
ment power to require people who send goods
into or out of Australia to affix to them an
honest and adequate description. The one
provision is necessary in the interests of Austra-
lian consumers; the other in the interests of
Australian producers. It is simply a modest
attempt to limit, as far as possible, some of the
appalling roguery which now goes on under the
name of commerce. This modest attempt at
honesty elicited from acting Opposition leader
Cook a really superlative snarl. It fairly made
his blood boil to suggest that a Government
should have the power to impose some re-
straint on a rogue and liar and swindler
who wants to import or export goods under
a false description. He did not merely object
to the method proposed by the Bill but to the
whole thing, lock, stock and barrel. Some of his
“reasons” were: England's trade is ten times
ours ; why not “ put aside all restrictions until our
trade has acquired a volume something like that
of Great Britain ” ? (In other words, why not wait
to prevent swindling, until it’s ten times as difficult
as it is now ? Let us increase our trade, whether
it’s honest or dishonest.) “ I think we are acting
wrongly in prescribing a standard in relation to
goods for export, and failing to fix one for goods
to be locally consumed.” (As if every State hadn’t
already got the fullest power to look after the
standard of goods to be consumed within
its own borders.) “We shall get along very
well without this Bill. We have done so
for many years.” Another N.S.W. misrepre-
sentative named Lee spoke in the same tone.
Dogald Thomson’s shriek was disfigured by a
most dishonest reference to the Immigration Re-
striction Act, which, he said, had been “used to
exclude six harmless hatters.” When told that
this was absolutely untrue, he explained that “he
paid no heed to such interjections.” An honest ac-
count of the part taken by the three N.S.W. mem-
bers mentioned in this debate would have done a lot
of good. It might have made N.S.W. blush, and
it's time N.S.W. did a little blushing over its part
in Federal politics. And it might have helped to
impress upon the public the necessity of adopting
some means of getting honest news.
Some Altered Circumstances.
When the first Parliamentary Labor party was
formed in Australia there was some reason for
“ sinking the fiscal issue.” The Laborites arrived
as a third party, offering support in return for
concessions. They wanted some few definite
pieces of legislation, and they frankly put them-
selves up to the highest bidder in order to get
them. The party had no immediate hope of
being anything more than a third party; its
model was always the Irish party in the House of
Commons. Now, since it wants to be more than
a third party, the whole situation has changed—
just as the situation would have changed if Par-
nell had secured a majority in the whole Com-
mons. While he was a third-party leader
he was satisfied to let the other two leaders
frame the foreign policy. But he wasn’t such
a fool as to suppose that it wasn’t necessary
for someone to fix up that policy. The Labor
party is in exactly the same position. So long as
it was satisfied to be a third party it wasn’t
necessarily its business to have a fiscal faith. It
simply left that to the other leaders. But when
it becomes more than a third party, then it has to
take the responsibility which it was previously
satisfied to let the others carry. It has to bother
about this question whether it wants to or not.
And if it isn’t prepared to bother about it, then it
should not aspire to be anything more than the
third party that it used to be. A man can’t ship
as a purser (in order to put some pursing ideas
into practice), and then aspire to be commander,
and still maintain that he needn’t worry about
navigation. The party’s alternative is quite
plain— to be a leader, and lead; or to be
a third party, and let others lead. What its
chances are as a third party in the present day it
probably hasn’t considered to any extent, being,
very sensibly, too busy considering what its
chances are as a first party. As a third party it
will have to be prepared, just as it used to be, to
jump across from one main party to another—to
bring in Protection to-morrow, and Freetrade the
next day; and it won’t take long for Australia, to
express a very definite opinion about a party
which keeps the country in a state of ferment like
that. The Protectionist wouldn’t, anyhow, accept
Protection on those terms, simply because nobody
would be foolish enough to establish factories
when, the day after they were started, the Pro-
tection would be liable to be abolished on a matter
of railway management or something equally irre-
levant. Therefore, the Labor party’s only hope is
to be one of the main parties ; it must struggle for
the leadership, like the rest of them ; and when it
gets the leadership, it must lead ; and if it isn’t
prepared to lead, it will sooner or later have to go
out of the business, and cease to be a party alto-
gether.

A Festival of Old Bones.
The Victorian Employers’ Federation held its
annual meeting a few days ago, and read its
annual report. The report was a quaint document,
and contained some statements and doctrines that
were out-of-date whenETHELRED the Unready fled
before the Danes. It was a lengthy affair, em-
bracing two wails and one curse to the inch and
its reading gave great pleasure to the reactionaries
who had gathered for the occasion. Some of the
document is as follows :
This body requests the employers of the Common-
wealth (except shipping) not to register under the Arbi-
tration Act.
We first raised the banner of anti-Socialism—(by the
way, where is that banner now?)
The question of legalising an eight-hours working day
for all occupations ... is being' inquired into, with a
view of strongly opposing it.
Attempts to extend the Wages Boards (under the Fac-
tories Act) should be strongly opposed.
It is well known that the brick combine is a per-
fectly honest and square business combination. (Tun
Bulletin thought at first that “ honest ” was a misprint
for “ dishonest,” but as the extract is from the Argus
let it go.)
The Victorian Compulsory Land Purchase Act is
another insidious form of Socialism.
After this excellent performance, the federation
treated itself to dinner, and then let itself go
some more. Squatter Skene read a letter he had
received from Carnegie, in which the man of
steel said that he had got over the labor trouble
by “taking in every worker as a shareholder,”
but as two rich men fell in a fit on the floor, and
Simon Fraser nearly suffocated, the subject was
not pursued. Derham and Harwood restored
the harmony by rejoicing over the defeat of the
Female Suffrage Bill, Harwood affirming, with
the defiant look of the wild ass of Persia, that he
would, vote against it “ seventy-times-seven
times.” He was proceeding to grow eloquent on
“ the sort of ladies who voted at the M'Eacharn-
Maloney election,” but someone hastily whis-
pered that they had voted “on the right side” ;
whereupon he said “hum!” in a loud tone, and
sat down. Fairbairn, who is president of the
museum, said that their federation “made for
freedom to work . . . freedom to do their busi-
ness in their own way,” and the roar of approval
with which this sentiment was greeted brought
most of the plaster down, and broke certain
bottles of assorted liquor. Then the collection of
freaks went home, to dream of a good time coming
when nobody would have a vote, and everybody
would have his hours increased, with a correspond-
ing reduction of wages.
—
Ex-Premier Jenkins, now Agent-General for
S.A., is, according to the National Review,
working to put the Northern Territory into the
hands of cotton-planter capitalists of the United
States. His idea is said to be to induce the
capitalists to build the transcontinental railway
by offering them concessions in land and labor,
and impressing them with a belief in the fitness
of the Territory for cotton-growing. In fact
Jenkins, according to this story, would seem to
almost ignore the Commonwealth’s legislation re
his friend the nigger. It is getting to be a
great deal past time that Australia had a
High Commissioner in London—a strong man
who is in sympathy with the White Aus-
tralia ideal and other democratic ideals, who
believes in Federalism and has no faith in “State
rights,” and who is mentally capable of wiping up
Fleet-street with the small venomous tribe of
Tozers and Jenkinses. Also it is more than
time that the Commonwealth took over the
Northern Territory, even if it should prove necessary
to take over all its liabilities and bad debts, and to
guarantee a transcontinental railway. The Terri-
tory is a lonesome and leaky back door through
which, so long as it is in the hands of the Jenkins
kind of Government, many strange Asiatics may
drift, even while Australia is busy passing valu-
able legislation on the front doorstep to keep
them out.
S.M. Herald on the sugar question:—
Briefly, the position is that the production of sugar in
the Commonwealth is now practically equal to the con-
sumption. Something like 200,000 tons is the annual
demand, and unless there is an influx of population to
increase the consumption very considerably, a good
season or two will create a surplus and bring prices down.
At once the question of export arises, and Mr. Swayne
rightly insists that unless very different conditions pre-
vail it will be quite impossible to compete in the world’s
market against sugar grown in other countries. The
Colonial Sugar Company has been obliged already to face
this problem. When there was a surplus of sugar
through a great crop in Queensland in 1897, arrangements
were made for export beyond Australia, and the Queens-
land planters joined with the company then to prevent
cut-throat competition. But the Kanaka was still avail-
able, and there seemed no likelihood that he would be
dismissed in the following decade. Now, however, the
conditions are quite altered.
All this is perfectly true, and it is only one more
proof that Protection and Labor legislation can’t
be disconnected. If the people who manufacture
for us are in England and Germany, we can only
sell our surplus sugar to them in competition with
the cheap, nigger-grown sugar of other countries,
and that is impossible (especially as we are bur-
dened with 16,000 miles of sea-carriage which is far
more than most of the nigger-grown sugar has
to pay) while the Queensland sugar industry pays
white men’s wages. Therefore under present con-
ditions expansion must soon end, or the employment
of white men must end. But if the manufacturing
population is shifted to Australia there will be
enough people to buy all the sugar we can grow,
and with charges and freight over a 16,000-mile
voyage saved, the industry can expand, it can pay
white men’s wages, and it still can supply sugar
as cheaply as it is sold in most European coun-
tries. There are three alternatives —Protection,
a return of the nigger, or an early stoppage in the
expansion of the sugar industry.
A Victorian legal man writes:—
Advocates of an equitable tax on land values may find
a lot of valuable information in the Victorian Doomsday
Book, i.e., the Land Tax Register. For instance, it is
therein recorded that Pursy Chirnside monopolises
36,396 acres of Victorian soil, the capital value of which
is set down for land-tax purposes at £1 an acre, although
some of that estate was recently sold at prices approach-
ing £3O an acre, and more of it is at present let to tenants
at an annual rental in excess of the alleged capital value.
The down-trodden Pursy’s annual contribution to the
revenue, in the shape of land-tax, is £2ll 17s. sd.
The possessions of George Chirnside, Pursey’s brother,
total 29,847 acres, also valued for tax purposes at £1 an
acre, yet the greater part of that little block is of superior
quality to the part sold to Fitzgibbon’s Board of Works
years ago at £l7 10s. an acre. The tax which this unfor-
tunate victim of class legislation annually pays is
£l6B 19s. Bd.
Again, take that distinguished member of the Stinking
Fish brigade, George Fairbairn, M.L. A., who was recently
trying to wring tears from select London audiences with
heart-rending tales of how men of enterprise (meaning
probably land sharks) were being maltreated in Australia.
This member of the Fairbairn clan is the holder of 5408
acres, valued for tax purposes at £1 an acre, and his
annual land-tax amounts to the enormous sum of
£lB 3s. 6d. Fairbairn did not mention these facts to his
London friends ; and, moreover, although he had much
to say about justice and law and order, he also forgot to
mention that almost every big estate in Victoria is merely
a huge aggregation of 320-acre blocks, which were stolen
from the people in bygone days by methods which not
only set at brazen defiance the laws of Victoria, but also
the laws of Moses.
In N.S.W. an Habitual Criminals Bill has been
introduced to Parliament. It will undoubtedly
be of some value, but it hardly goes far enough in
some directions, and in some it goes too far. The
person declared to be an “habitual” is, at the
end of his sentence, to be confined indeterminately
in a reformatory, and required to work there at
some useful calling, receiving part of the product
of his labor at a time when he is judged suffi-
ciently reformed to be released. A person may
be declared an habitual on the third conviction
for a sexual or poisoning offence, on the fourth
conviction for burglary, coining, forgery, larceny,
embezzlement, and similar offences. The sexual
criminal, usually a manaic, should not have to
.l
commit three horrible crimes before being shut
up indeterminately. On the other hand, three pre-
vious convictions for larceny would hardly justify
a possible imprisonment for life as an “ habitual.”
And offences of violence seem to have been
mostly lost sight of. Yet it is of far more
importance to hold the habitual thug tight than
the habitual petty larcenist. The law seems to
have a horrible idea that a man would rather lose
two eyes than two umbrellas, and that it is less
criminal to make a human face a thing of dread
for life than to steal a plate of ham out of the
kitchen.
-
Premier Bent lately promised to lay his massive,
intellect on to a problem that is likely to prove
hard to solve. A Gippsland tenant-farmer wrote, <
asking him if, in intervals when he wasn’t grap- *
pling with the Closer Settlement and unemployed
questions, he could spare a few moments for him
—the tenant-farmer. He said he rented 120 acres
at £75 a year ! He had stock and a few imple-
ments, but no money to erect buildings and other
improvements, and as fast as he made a little
money the landlord’s agent (the landlord himself
was an absentee) came along and took it. The
municipal valuation of the place was £3o—the
rent £75. If he were asked “Why pay such
excessive rent ? ” he must reply that he had to
do it, or go and be rack-rented just as badly
somewhere else. Premier Bent said he would see
what he could do, but he doubtless knows well
enough that a Closer Settlement policy won’t
touch such a case as this. The necessity is for a
Landlord Suppression Act that will impose a
heavy graduated land-tax on all estates above a
small minimum area, with an extra rate and no
exemption where the owner is not the occupier,
and another extra rate on top of this where the
owner is an absentee. But Bent is hardly the
man to do that, though he looks about the most
likely man at present on deck. This country has
always been full of tenderness for the landlord—
and especially the absentee landlord.
«
George Reid, and the Argus, and Sydney Tele-
graph, and the rest of the perjurers who manu-
factured the Petriana myth and the fables of the
Hatters and the Potters don’t seem to have
noticed the case of Margaret Northingxon, a
lady of 75, who somehow got on to a sailing
ship in these parts two or three years ago, and
seems to have spent most of her time since then
knocking first at the door of Canada and then
at that of the U.S. First, she tried to get,into
Canada, where she thought she had a daughter,
but wasn’t sure. As she couldn’t specify where
her daughter was, Canada said she couldn’t come
in, as she wasn’t the sort of immigrant it was
advertising for. Then she went along to San
Francisco; and when the U.S. Immigration
Bureau shut her out a lawyer took up her case,
and it got into the courts, and that is all that hap-
pened. She wasn’t allowed to land. Then the
British Minister at Washington was appealed to,
while the old lady still roamed the homeless sea,
and he said that the only thing would be to ship
her back to Maoriland, where she came from, or
to England, which takes in anybody. The
Petriana perjurers and other Stinking Fish poli-
ticians have scattered the idea that Australia is
the only country in the world where any sort of
white person can’t walk in withou* knocking;
they ought to interview Mrs. Northington on this
subject when that old lady turns up again in these
parts.
The Bulletin receives an interesting letter all the
way from England. It is on blue paper, and is
headed “City of Winchester,” and adorned with
the arms of that ancient metropolis—five castles
and two needlessly-dragged-out animals with tails
that form the letter “S.” The blue document
with the two protracted beasts asks for subscrip-
tions to repair the grave of Alfred the Great,
who lost all interest in the things of this world
1004 years ago. This paper regrets that it can’t
see its way to accede to the request contained in
the document that starts with the two prolonged
brutes. It is saving up to provide graves for (1)
the Argus, (2) the Courier, (3) the Telegraph,
(4) the Register, (5) Cohen, (6) Neild’s poems,
(7) the Stinking Fish party, (8) the Foreign-trade
crowd, (9) Joe Cook’s voice, (10) Bruce Smith’s
bell-topper, (11) that phrase about the “ great
natural resources of the country,” (12) Dill-
Macky’s calves, (13) the Address-in-Reply, (14)
Pumpkin Smith’s cataract of beer-colored whis-
kers, (15) the devil, (16) the 12th of July—which
is much the same thing, (17) George Reid’s eye-
glass, (18) the sweater, (19) the nigger-labor
person, (20) Bland Holt’s new pro-Jap bellow-
drama, (21) Empire Day. With all these and
other burials on hand, it has no money to spare
for the tomb of Alfred the Great.
♦
The soured Joe Cook has broken out in a new
place. In the dispute between S.A., Victoria
and N.S.W. re the division of the Murray waters,
two of the counsel who have been retained all
along are Josiah Symon and Isaac Isaacs.
Symon was Attorney- eneral in the Reid Minis-
try, and one of Holy Joe’s chiefs. Isaacs is
.Attorney-General in the Deakin Ministry, which
didn’t offer Holy Joe a portfolio. So Cook rose
the other night, as a horrified man who had just
heard of a new iniquity, to say that it was a
scandal that the Attorney-General should be
mixed up in such things. Seeing that everybody
knew months and months ago that both Isaacs
and Symon were retained, the question was natur-
ally asked why Cook didn’t protest in the exactly
similar case of Symon, while that gentleman was
Attorney-General. And Cook blushlessly assured
the House that he had never heard of the matter
until just then. If he had known earlier he would
have rushed at his leader’s colleague, Symon, like
a bulldog, even if he burst up the Reid Ministry
in the cause of rectitude and lost his own chance
of a portfolio in the scuffle. The House struggled
hard not to look incredulous, but Cook puts a
considerable strain on the House’s countenance at
times.

The Papuan religio-mercantile co., projected by
missionary Walker, bears a good deal of resem-
blance in its main features to the A. A. Company
at its start. The A.A. Co., which has cursed
Australia for nearly three-quarters of a century, 1
began operations on a semi-religious baste. The
promoters professed philanthropy of the noblest
pattern and repudiated the idea of 'hungering for
lucre. They incorporated in their charter prof
visions for the establishment of schools ! and 'mairi-
tenance of ministers of religion; otte of the first
officers appointed being a clergyman to act as
chaplain. There is no doubt that men like Joseph
Hume took shares in the co. in the belief that
philanthropy was to be the leading feature of its
operations. The co., fioivever, abandoned its higU
principles after a short trial, and went on all fours
to devour the land. It revised its articles, ,recon- ;
structed itself, threw piety out on its ear in the
bush, and has stamped itself on the history of
N.S.W. as a block to settlement and a rapacious
land-eater and man-sweater. •'

Giacometti’s “ Marie Antoinette,” in
which Miss Nance O’Neil returned to Sydney on
Saturday night, comes undeservedly recom-
mended for its historical accuracy. Historical
accuracy calls for a just balance between cause
and effect; and here we have practically nothing
but the effect. Worse still, so far as the cause is
mentioned at all, Marie Antoinette, taking her
own distorted view of the matter, puts the revolu-
tionists utterly and grotesquely in the wrong. She
can see no reason for the fierce enmity of the
people against the court, except that when she
wears velvet the crowd says she should wear silk,
and when she wears silk the crowd says she is
extravagant; and when Marie Nanceoneiile draws
herself up to her full five-feet-ten, and cuts at the
crowd with the remark that, under the circum-
stances, the only thing to do is to despise and
laugh at it, the d.c. and stalls applaud tre-
mendously. They have an idea that Marie
Nanceoneiile is the president, or lady organiser,
or something, of a Reform League, and they
want to let one another see that they
think just the same about the Labor party as the
Very Nicest do. Only once, and then but for 10
seconds, does Louis XVI. pull back the curtain
and disrespectfully mention the shocking Orleans
Regency and the more shocking Louis XV.; but
there is even then barely a hint that, while the
court gave itself up to license that knew ho
bounds, the monarchy was a despotism which
existed for no other purpose than to gratify its own
lusts, and the people for no other purpose than to
supply the means. The pendulum only swang
back so far towards ruffianism in rags because it
had been pulled just as far, or further, the other
way, towards ruffianism in silks—Santerre, the
Citizen-General, and Simon, the Cobbler, at one
end; Orleans and Louis XV. at the other.
Simon, who honestly owns that he doesn’t like,
children, and always wants to pinch them and
make them squeal, makes all the chiffon shiver,
M’sieur the Count, who really didn’t care a hang
how many children squealed so long as he had a
“ good time,” but would never be honest enough
to say so—the same chiffon merely notices that he
was ever so nice-looking and wore beautiful
clothes. So the prologue, though it frolics around
the subject of a fete at Trianon, doesu't throw
much real light on the subject. And, in fact,
Marie Antoinette’s own capers were more frivolous
than harmful. But the people did not know
that. Outwardly they looked just like the old
capers. And certainly they bled the people just
as much.
■* * * *
In what is essentially a series of rather
disjointed tableaux, Miss O’Neil is first a reckless
frivoller, not very graceful and not very striking,
persuading her Xing to take the road to the
scaffold. She is, for all that, a better wife and
mother than she is a Queen, and does her best
work at the leave-taking of her husband and her
children. She is mistress of the emotions of the
heart-broken woman. Five years ago, when she
knew less of her art than she does now, she
showed that, in her “Peg Woffington” and
“Leah.” In the present depressing play (the
gloom is broken by scarcely one smile) she has two
great chances to exhibit the broken heart, and
she takes them both—once when she hangs
pitifully upon the door that has closed on the weak
Xing whom she has done so much to send to the
knife, the other when she forgets that she
is anything else but a mother, and crouches
at the feet of Simon, appointed guardian of
her child. If there was a catch in the
throat of the audience, it was then. The
Xing is pictured better than he was; in an -
excellent piece of work, which shows Louis the
Unready on the night before he paid the price of
others’ sins and his own follies, John Glendenning
makes him an heroic character. Andrew Robson
as La Fayette, Mario Majeioni as the Xing’s
constant friend Malesherbes, and Gaston
Mervale’s Santerre stand out conspicuously from a
cast which, in several places, wears its glit-
tering costumes better than it does anything
else. Mrs. Henry Bracy, whom Saturday’s
crowded house at Her Majesty’s welcomed
with almost as much noise as it did Miss
O’Neil, leaves nothing wanting in the small part of
Madame de Campan ; and everything ends with a
momentary glimpse of a queen, shorn of her
bleached hair, mounting the steps that lead
towards the blood-red guillotine in the
the shivery end to a lesson that the play fails to
teach.
* * *
“ A Sailor’s Sweetheart,” staged at Sydney
Royal on Saturday, gives early promise of sanity.
The first act opens well, and suggests a thrilling
story which won’t run off the rails of probability.
But the early promise is not fulfilled. The scene
shifts to West Africa, where all the characters
find themselves among a nation of black savages,
who crucify prisoners or burn them at the
stake, and who wear coal-black tights, sell
mining concessions, and keep lady captives
“for a fate worse than death.” These
absurd savages, whose manners and customs
are partly of the London Stock Exchange, partly
of the Senegambia coast, and partly of ancient-
Jewry, are in no way convincing. The height of
incongruity is reached when, in the midst of the
African jungle, a detachment of British tars,
accompanied by a brass band, interrupts an auto
da fe at the thrilling moment when the fire is
beginning to lick its chops for the feast. Apart
from the absurdity of the plot and incidents, a
good deal more than is necessary of the unpleasant
is dragged in. The “ hero ” at one point spends
a full ten minutes wriggling in death agonies,
writing a letter of warning (which he pre-
sumably posts in the mouth of an alligator),
using his heart’s blood as ink ; and even after this
spoiling of good paper he doesn’t remain dead,
but is revived by an African medicine man so that
he may marry the heroine in the last act. No
melodrama should inflict ten minutes of death
struggles on an audience when the man isn’t going
to die after all.
* * « *
Acting in “A Sailor’s Sweetheart” is not
above what the piece deserves. Miss Eugenie
Duggan, George Cross, C. R. Stanford (a pretty
good character sketch he gives of a rascally six-
and-eightpenny man), and Rert Bailey have the
chief parts and act them strenuously. That there
is a keen demand for this sort of show is proved
by the fact that “ A Sailor’s Sweetheart ” is draw-
ing excellent houses.
* * * *
If “The Walls of Jericho,” produced at
Sydney Criterion by the Broughs on Saturday
night, still “goes” in London, Agent-General
Tozer must have numerous inquiries from
Britons as to that delectable place Queensland.
A hegira of the penniless but willing-to-work
Smart Set—-if the Smart Set is ever willing to work
—might occur, with the Banana State for its
objective. “Frobisher of Queensland ” the play
might be named, for he looms large in it and J ericho
looms not at all. Sutro, the author, has been
talking to Hornung or some such. “Fighting
Jack ” and “Mad Jim ” are the nicknames of two
of the principal male characters in the piece.
The British writer must have the Australian nick-
named. “Dead Horse Bob,” or “ Red Dust Billy,”
or “ Fighting Jack,” and you’ve got a man racy of
the Australian plains. But “The Walls of
Jericho” are mainly built of bricks pro-
vided by the Smart Set in London, and
fashioned of materials with as much resistant
power as boiled potatoes or bread-crumbs. Yet it
is a “smart’’play, and will draw as easily as a
swift dromedary could tow a mouse. Mr. Brough
and Miss Emma Temple got a long and loud re-
ception on first night; so did Mr. Herbert Flem-
ming. The leading lady, Miss Beatrice Day, is in
the play a smart woman, a smart flirt, daughter of
a smart marquis, and the audience can well under-
stand that she will be the smartest woman in
Queensland when she goes out there with her
cattle-club-president husband, whose frock-coats
never fit him.

“ The Coquette,” staged at Sydney Palace,
was heralded as a work by Australians, and it
claimed support as a local production ; and the
loyal Australians who went down to bless re-
mained to curse a hotchpotch of reminiscences of
“The Geisha,” “ Floradora,” “The Runaway
Girl,” and all the rest of the tripe that has eman-
ated from the other side of the world the last few
decadent years. The plot of “The Coquette” is
just puerile, the dialogue wearisome. There
is no room in an Australian production
for the dreary Countess who runs a matri-
monial bureau, or the stuttering baronet who
takes to detective work as a hobby. These
are the things that go to damn “ The Coquette.”
On the other hand, the music is very fine, and, in
this writer’s humble opinion, would do credit to
any country in the world. Also, the lyrics are in
many cases distinctly good. Barring a slight de-
railment of the chorus on the first night at the end
of Act I, over an unusually difficult but exqui-
sitely beautiful reach of harmony, the
show went very smoothly. Miss Minnie
Regan sang delightfully. Mr. W. J. Curtis
always acts well, and on Monday night he
acted better than usual. Mr. J. MKeown, as the
exotic baronet who took to detective work, and Mr.
Blandford Wright, as the manager of the Golden
Shore Insurance Co., are eminently satisfactory.
But the heartsease of the show is the face and
figure of Miss Clara Lyttelton. It is worth the
money to gaze upon her.
* * *
On Sept. 6,7, and 8 will be produced at
the Palace that good old opera, “The Bohemian
Girl.” Dwells there a man or woman with soul
so dead who does not yearn to re-hear now
and then such old favorites as “When Other Lips,”
“ I Dreamt that I Dwelt.” etc., and “ The Heart
Bowed Down”? Mr. Edward Farley will be
the Devilshoof of the piece; Miss Violet
the Arline, and Miss Edie Britton, the Gipsy
Queen. Mr. Asprey, who was deputy-conductor
and chorus master in Mr. Williamson’s produc-
tions of grand opera, will run the undertaking,
which will be for the benefit of the Children’s
Hospital. Misses Mount and Britton will sing
new songs, written expressly for them by Mr.
Asprey. Dr. H. C. Moxham is hon. secretary for
the movement.

The things that have been happening at
the Tivoli for the past week aren’t much of a
guide as to the things that are going to happen in
the next. Manager Leete has bought a broom,
and on Friday night will sweep the sky, and from
Saturday night onwards proprietor Rickards will
begin to drop new stars into it from the dizzy
heights of the London and European ’alls. But
an oldish star will blaze for one final week—Kara,
the deft juggler, who had only just got his sea-legs
when ’citis laid him on his back and kept him
there for months. The present brief season is to
show how one man can conquer both appendicitis
and the laws of gravitation while waiting for a
boat.

“ The Cingalee,” which was the subject of
lavish allusions in The Bulletin during its weeks
in Sydney, has now come to stay awhile at Pier
Majesty’s, Melbourne. Somebody captured heavy
damages from a London manager, on the
that ‘‘The Cingalee” contained the original ideas
of the somebody else aforesaid. If there was a
germ of startling novelty in the first scheme ol
this reminiscent musical comedy, it must
have got lost in the alteration. Ihe singm 0
lady of Ceylon is practically the Geisha who lm s
at Floradora ; the nobleman of Kandy m , S'f lt ,. be
a Japanese Marquis from Bhong ; and all the
white men and ladies in the present tea-party are
old friends from previous comedies. George
Lauri, as a Baboo Lawyer, is not exactly like any
former individual, neither does the Devil Dancer
suggest aught but a pantomime. In tact, tne
Devil Dancer is strictly unusual as regards the
present class of production, but he doesn t break
the monotonv to an appreciable extent. All this
being accepted as comment of no import-
anee, it only remains to say that “ The Cingalee
is rather above the average strength in spectacular
fixings and concerted music. A long drawn, out
finale to the Ist act is full of “tone _ and color
and other impressive terms. A ballet m the _nd
act has an eerie snap in it (whatever that may
mean) and the merits of the .Royal Comic Opera
Co. are the same solid merits as formerly with the
addition of Miss Margaret Thomas s refined sing-
ing. Present scribe knows no cause or reason why
“ The Cingalee ” should not realise the manage-
ment’s fondest anticipations. It is full of nice
tuneful girls and in the sacred name of Woman
(who passeth all understanding) this story oi
Chambuddy Ram calls for public approval.
As the heroines of a cockney comedietta
and a picturesque farce in three acts, Miss Nellie
Stewart, on Saturday night, made two additions
to her long list of achievements at Melbourne
Princess’s. She has given similar proofs of her
adaptable talent in previous tests, where, perhaps,
the character of the work was more humanly
interesting, but it was not so strikingly exhibited
in “Sweet Nell” or “Mice and Men ” as it now
is in “ ’Op o’ me Thumb” and “The Marquis de
Treville.” . The comedietta supposes a poor, little
cockney laundry drudge drawing on her imagina-
tion for a fairy sweetheart who loads her w.th
invisible jewels, and intends to make her queen of
his “carstle” when he comes into the family
“ erstates.” The only visible excuse for the young-
gal’s fiction is a bloke who once left his Sunday
shirt with her to be washed and ironed, and didn’t
call for it when expected. On his return from gaol
the bloke calls for his bloomin’ shirt. The dialogue
between him and the adoring gal doesn’t make it
quite clear whether his diseased fancy had turned
to thoughts of love, or whether her sole ambition
was to be took out for the day by a bloke as would
make the other gals envious of her, but it is very
good cockney dialogue, and Nellie Stewart gets
much humor and some pathos out of the situation.
Also, the bloke is convincingly presented by
James Lindsay, otherwise the scene couldn’t be so
strong.
“The Marquis De Treville” is a wildly
original farce by the author of “ What Happened
to Jones.” The atmosphere of the story is purely
theatrical, the characters are of stage extraction,
and their decorative costumes suggest a doubtful
period in the world’s history. It was the
period when a Prince of Hohenlohe had to be
elected by the votes of three old . German
gentlemen. The candidate, whom Countess
Nellie Stewart favored, was unable to canvass
the three electors, therefore she impersonated him
in highly attractive clothes and won the royal
billet for him, after which the company went
through a series of stately manoeuvres. The
romance is a mighty fine spread for the leading
lady. In the second and third acts she mas-
querades like Viola in. “Twelfth Night,” to the
discomfiture of James Lindsay, who figures as a
reminder of Sir Andrew Aguecheek. She gets
gracefully drunk, she changes one disguise for
another, and is the centre of attraction all the
time. None of the characters have any truth in
them, but Nellie Stewart and her supporters are
entertaining, decorative people, well fitted to their
respective parts. Harcourt Beatty is, perhaps,
the least fitted. - Mrs. Maesmore Morris plays the
handsome friend of the defeated candidate,
Malcolm Dunn is the elected prince ; Dudley Clin-
ton and Harry Parker have something droll to do,
and Miss Amy Willard makes a sprightly accom-
plice of the star she-male. The Musgrove Co.’s
season is for 12 nights only, and the programme
will probably be directed next week by an Agri-
cultural Show policy of popular revivals.
* . * * *
The pro-Japanese yellow-drama at Mel-
bourne Royal continues to revel in Russian
disasters. Bland Holt will probably prolong the
siege of Port Arthur for another week or two, and
in the meantime the ballet that precedes the act
of surrender might as well be reinforced by a
chorus and a strong quartet. If some more vaude-
ville items were introduced, one of the performers
might impersonate a Jap spy who would kill the
Russian commandant with a British comic song.
The Athenaeum Hall—glorified by the
Geachy title of Australia’s Egyptian Hall—is to
re-open on Saturday for the accommodation of
The G.eat Thurston. Owing to his Greatness
the stage has been enlarged, and the hall is accpiir-
in</ an air of distinction suitable to the magician’s
pre eminence. Also, the down Hall will be
opened to the public on Saturday by Miss Mac-
lachlan, the Scottish, Irish, and sometimes English
ballad singer, an artist who likewise is Great,
although she merely calls herself Jessie.

At Melbourne Opera House a new turn is
Avalon Collard, a well-meaning “entertainer” of
the mildest description, such as is usually found
at polite muffin-struggles and pious annual gather-
ings. Clarice Dudleigh, a damsel who can smg,
is "another recent arrival, and the varied assort-
ment of older turns appears to be wearing pretty
well.

“E.” from Melbourne describes a casual
little show :
I write this in evening-dress. Trinity College Dialectic
Society has given its annual intellectual evening, during
which' the new Prelector, Mr. Leonard Arnold, B. A., has
favored us with a chaste paper on “ Australian Litera-
ture.” His Grace the Archbishop sat in the chair, looking
gorgeous in a friendly smile and ermine robes. Leonard,
the learned, discussed Australian literature with passionate
nrldness in a confident, drony, curate-like tone of voice,
and remarked that Australians had no humor. He sig-
nified the same in the usual manner. Deakin “ thanked ”
the tame Prelector with much polite banter ; and Wally
Murdoch tried to show what a superior-minded man he
was by remarking that Kendall was a fourth-rate rhymer,
and Australians had no writers of genius, and thakthere
was no such thing as Australian literature at all, Aus-
tralian literature, such as it was, being merely a branch
of English literature. It was all very intellectual and
soothing, and the note of dignified reticence echoed
through the hall. Nobody seemed to desire to suggest
anything, hut we all wore evening-dress and looked nice.
While the Archbishop was addressing the cultured multi-
tude I dispersed.

Williamson lias replaced one opera co. by
another at Adelaide Eoyal. “ The Orchid ” went
out in a blaze of splendor, Miss Clara Clifton being
dropped into the cast to strengthen the comedy
element. George Lauri introduced his wild and
woolly Prehistoric Man on the farewell night.
Complaints have been heard that W. S. Percy said
“Damn’’too monotonously, and was hammered
with a champagne-bottle for too prolonged spaces
of time; but you can’t please everybody. The
Gilbert and Sullivan season has now opened—
Vernon had a tremendous reception—and the low
comedian has to say approximately what is written
for him. At the Tivoli, Frank Clark strengthens
the programme with his own illustrated ballads,
but announces that this, the seventh week of h.s
co.’s season, will be the last.
Whilst growing' younger with the years
That rob the charms of lesser mummers,
Our Nell appears and re-appears
(Her seasons seeming always summers)
To ’guile us into smiles and tears
With bright display of old ar.dnew art.
The actress we proclaimed of yore
Most versatile among the rivals
Comes back, and gives us something more—
Fresh parts for subsequent revivals,
Still doing better than before
She gilds the name of Nellie Stewart.

This seems to be how matters stand m con-
nection with N.S.W. railways. Down to 1902 ex-Auditor-
General Rennie showed the results of working- the lines
as follows :
Income from the beginning .. .. £72,353,087
Expenditure—
Working .. .. £46,385,260
Interest .. .. 34,191,084
80,576,344
Deficit to June, 1902 .. £8,223,257
The new Auditor-General showed the position for the next
two years ; at the end of that time a Parliamentary_ Com-
mittee went into certain matters that were in dispute
between the Auditor-General and the Railway Commis-
sioners. In particular the latter had declined to reckon
as capital expenditure a matter of £600,000 advanced 25
years ago to buy materials and stores. The committee
added this amount to railway capital, and on that basis
the Commissioners showed a deficit of £36,698; so the
whole situation looms up like this :
Deficit to June, 1902 .. £8,223,257
Deficit, 1903 .. 521,961
„ 1904 .. 408,437
~ 1905 .. 36,698
Total Deficit to June, 1905 .. £9,190,353
This, however, puts the matter in the most favorable light
possible. As, for instance, the railways had deficits 40
years ago, and had to get advances from the State, and
as in most cases the State had to borrow in order to make
those advances, the deficits ought to be charged with the
interest that the State has had to pay. That one small
matter of £600,000, advanced 25 years ago, and coolly dis-
regarded ever since by the department, now represents a
debt of £l,4l7,Boo—the original debt, which has never
been paid off, compounded at 3J per cent. The debt
which the Railways owe to the State, instead, then, of
being £9,190,353, 'is probably nearer £14,000,000. They
(with tramways—the two are herein regarded as one)
have cost £46,700,472 to construct and equip ; it has cost
the State another £13,000,000 or £14,000,000 to keep them
going. Yet the cheerful idiot still coos that the public
debtfis represented by “permanent and reproductive”
works, and that thus we can regard ourselves as not hav-
ing borrowed anything, and as owing- nothing ; wherefore
we are quite justified in borrowing now all that we can
get Cohen to lend.

The Parliamentary Committee which dealt
with the railway accounts found that £434,184 has
been spent on N.S.W. railways out of consolidated reve-
nue. In other words, N.S.W. has built its railways with
99 per cent, of Cohen’s money and 1 per cent, of its own;
and still N.S.W. reckons that in the matter of “ sturdy
self-reliance ” and “ manly independence ” it would take
a lot of beating. For tramways, £22,455 out of a total of
£3,637,922 has been provided out of revenue ; in connec-
tion with tramways, N.S. Wales’ sturdy, self-reliance pans
out at about 14s. per £loo—l4s., sturdy self-reliance:
£99 65., leaning against Bull Cohen.

The new electric light installation of the Mel-
bourne Exhibition Cycle Track, formed a great attraction
of the recent “Austral” meeting. The main feature of
the system is the “Ganz” brilliant arc lamp, forty of
which are distributed round the track, suspended on iron
brackets. The light is absolutely steady, soft and
diffused, doing away entirely with the injurious glare
common with other lamps and overcoming the objection-
able shadows in and under the globe. Special globes are
used which, while diffusing' the light, do not cut off an
undue quantity and the effect is a light known
scientifically to be the best for all illuminating purposes.
The candle power is more than four times that furnished
by other lamps at the same current consumption. Electric
lighting by the “Ganz” arc lamp is cheaper than any
other form of iliuminant, both in first cost', in fixing and
in maintenance. The contractors for this installation
were the Austral Otis Engineering Co., Ltd., corner
Hannah and Kavanagh streets, South Melbourne, Sole
Agents for Ganz und Co., Budapest, Hungary, who will
gladly furnish estimates and expert advice upon sinulaj
or any electrical schemes.* .

The British Broken Hill Silver Mining Co.,
after careful consideration of all types of boilers, have
placed an order with Babcock and Wilcox for three large
boilers, each of 500 b.p. Superheaters, chain grate

This interesting experiment in State banking continues
to avoid doing most of the things that the opponents of a
State Bank say a State Bank would be sure to do. from
the beginning £163,384 has been paid to it in interest,
and the total arrears last year amounted to only £l''•Jo-
Twelve months before they were £1880; so that the
arrears have actually been reduced. There is a small item
“Contingent Expenses” which might possibly c f > vf J r
writings-off, though it doesn’t look like it; so it seems that,
instead of making wholesale bad debts toneedy constituents
ofM.’sP., the S. A. State Bank is making practically no
bad debts at all. Twelve months ago £287,334 of advances
had been repaid, leaving, on the word of the trustees,
less than £ll,OOO overdue instalments outstanding; and,
though the published balance-sheet doesn’t show ho\\
things are in that respect (it would be a more complete
document if it did), yet, judging from the fact that the
overdue interest has been reduced, it seems likely tnat
the movement in the matter of principal repayments has
been satisfactory also.
While repayments have been going on steadily,
there has been no special demand for advances during the
current year. S. Australia hasn’t been cracking its throat
telling the other person to go on the land ; just after the
drought in the Eastern States, during which S. Australian
farmers had a g'ood enough time to buy new buggies
wholesale, there was a bit of a movement that way ;
and it used up all the available settlers for a year
or two. Therefore the new advances haven’t now, after
that spurt, equalled the repayments. This and some
other particulars are shown next: —

Under the clumsy S. Australian system, which isn’t the
fault of the bank, but of the Act that created it, when
advances are paid bonds have to be bought back ; then,
when new advances are made, new bonds have to be
issued. This adds to the expenses ; and yet they are
extremely moderate. As to these bonds :

One effect of the existence of the State Bank, which isn’t
a bank that makes profits its first consideration, is that,
even if it is not lending - to any great extent, it keeps the
public rate of interest on good securities 16w. This
applies to city lands as well as farms ; for this bank can
lend on either ; as a matter of fact, about a third of the
advances are on town and suburban freeholds. Therefore
some insurance co.’s, which make mortgage business a
specialty, practically lend nothing in Adela.de. “We
can’t get a high enough rate of interest there,” they say.

The figures show much the same movements as those of
other banks doing business in Australia. Compared with
the position 12 months ago, deposits and other liabilities
to the public have moved up from £18,584,923 to
£19,180,260, an increase of £595,337. On the other hand,
advances have shrunk from £13,171,511 to £11,957,220 ; a
contraction of £1,214,291. Considerably over a million of
the money which 12 months ago was earning 6 or 7 per
cent, in Australia is now earning only 1J or 2 per cent, in
London ; hence the shrinkage in profits. Meantime the
factories and enterprises with which Australia ought to
supply its pwn needs, and which would call for the
profitable use of these funds, are being carried on to the
profit of foreign manufacturers and foreign workers and
foreign bankers. In coin, stocks, and other liquid assets
the bank’s holding represents 48 per cent, of all liabilities to
the public, which is probably about 13 or 15 p. c. more than
safety calls for ; in other words, under a more reasonable
Australian policy this bank alone has'about £2,750,000
which might safely' be out earning more for shareholders
(and in the long run also for depositors), while benefiting
Australia as well. Certainly, even as things are, the profits
are excellent, amounting to £7 16s. sd. p.c. on capital and
reserves ; but they might be better. If they didn’t want
all the improvement themselves, the shareholders might
restore to their staff some of that wage-reduction which
was made a good many years ago. As a rule, however,
the bank clerk is a person who seems to approve of (ieo.
Reid and the piebald Revenue-Tariffism which results in
£2,750,000 being shut up in a box instead of being out
earning some more salary for him. The writing-down
this half-year is directed to Australian premises and
property account, which now stands at £552,538.

This result is arrived at by combining the figures of the
two branches. But, under the articles, having completed
its fifth year, the society now presents the industrial a,id
ordinary- accounts separate. And these show the situa-
tion for the y'ear as follows :
Claims, Ex- Added to
Income. &c. penses. Funds. Funds.
Industrial ..£28,446 £1686 £16,825 £4935 £5,905
Ordinary .. 10,222 1142 5,615 3465 13,175
Total .. £33,663 £2828 £22,440 £B4OO £19,080
In addition to these funds the Standard has a share-
holders’ paid capital of £12,500, used in the industrial
branch, which by and bye, if things go well, will have to
provide it yvith dividends. This branch also reckons as
an asset a paper item, “Business Extension Account,
£5500.” As this amount has been actually spent, and is
represented by- nothing that can be seen or handled or
smelt, it is disregarded in the foregoing. One satisfac-
tory feature of the situation is that this fictitious asset is
not being added to. What the society- is spending nowa-
days it is charging up against current revenue.
In 1903-4 surrenders were, comparatively speak-
ing, enormous, amounting to £11,717, while claims only-
totalled £2168. A probable explanation was that, having
completed the necessary three years’ life, many of the
without-profit, fourpence-a-fortnight sort of policies were
surrendered for ordinary with-prorit policies. That, of
course, swelled the outgoings ; at the same time it pro-
bably puffed up the income to some extent, and gave an
exaggerated idea of the growth of the business. There is
one very good reason why the policy-holder should
nhine-e over from the Standard’s industrial to
the ordinary branch whenever he has the chance?-
for while the with-proflt policy-holders in the ordinary
branch “ shall have distributed among them the whole
of the surplus profits of that branch,” in the industrial
branch the shareholders are entitled to the> first h>te *rom
the profits, sufficient to pay alO per cent drv... and if the
10 percent, isn’t available in any year, the deficiencj is a
prior charge upon future profits ; and even in addition to
this cumulative 10 per cent, dividend the shareholdms
are entitled to one-fifth of anything that is left, iio
bably the average industrial policy-holder m any offace
doesn’t expect bonuses. In that case, so far as
Standard is concerned, he is a fortunate man , f
isn’t likely to be disappointed for many a day. Six years
have passed now without shareholders getting their' dm-
dend and six times 10 is 60, so 60 per cent on £l2 500 is
policv under the best ol conditions is the vuWVporest
form of policy—the form under which the msui ei „ets
the very least for his money—and under these con-
ditions 'it is a greyer, gloomier form of insurance than
ever. ,
It looked last year as though the Standard had
got its expense rate in hand, and was steadily hauling it
down in very good style. But, as said just now, the
income was probably puffed by the conversion business at
a comparatively low rate. This year the income has
fallen seriously. In view of the small sum paid out in
claims and surrenders this seems to point to a very heavy
proportion of lapses; also, probably, to no great
rushing after new business. In the latter case, ex
penses ought to be smaller. As a matter of fact, bunching
the branches together, the rate has turned the wrong

In the industrial section the cost was £71155. 2d. p.c. of
all income ; in the ordinary section, £54 18s. 7d. p.c.
Both these rates are excessive. Up to now, the ottice lias
been kept out of difficulties mainly by a favorable mor-
tality experience. Indeed, notwithstanding the exces-
sively heavy expense-rate, the society, declared a 1 p.c.
reversionary bonus on ordinary policies as the result of
the actuarial investigation at'ttie end of last year, but
the policy-holders are going to die some day ; so favorable
an experience can’t be relied upon in the future. In the
industrial branch a surplus was also shown, apart from
capital. But life policies less than three years in force were
excluded from the calculation ; and though older offices
may do the same thing, in this case it meant excluding
probably much more than half of the entire indus-
trial life policies. Further, in the ordinary branch, it was
assumed that 4 per cent, would be earned, whereas the
actual earnings of mean funds during the past year were
only £3 12s. 3d. per cent. It is extremely doubtful,
therefore, whether any bonus should have been declaied.
In any case, the position obviously requires a strong
onslaught upon the expense-rate ; on success in that
direction the future of the office seems to depend abso-

The amount written off for the half-year is £2500, which
is at the rate of 1 p.c. p.a. on the book-value of brewery,
plant, and properties ; and that certainly' doesn’t appear
an extravagant allowance for wear and tear and decay,
especially as some of the properties are on leasehold.
Other details don’t make the situation appear much more
cheerful: —

Profits as shown by working account were never so small;
management costs have, however, been cut down, so that
the net result is rather better than that of the previously-
worst half-year. Yet as management costs include main-
tenance (the co.’s accounts have the lumping habit badly),
it is quite possible that the half-year which looks better
may'only' have been made to look like that through skimp-
ing the paint on the Toobev pubs. ; or the half-year that
looks worse may'only look like that through something
extra-special in- the way of repairs. On the other hand,
the very rapid growth of the lumped “brewery, plant,
premise’s,” &c., item may mean that everything in the
shape of extensions and improvements is charged to
capital account. This, however, is certain : that all the
undivided profits (including reserves), made since the co.
began, and nearly £15,000 of debts collected in that time,
and another £lO,OOO of debt contracted by the co., have
all gone into fixed property' of one sort and another , and
the investment can’t somehow be said to look very pro-
fitable so far. The extra £60,000 ought to he earning,
say, an extra £3OOO a year (even assuming that a little of
the £15,000 trade accounts, which help to make up the
£60,000, was previously earning something) ; and yet the
profits certainly' don’t show it.

This is discouraging. It looks, too,- as though the stated
profits for the half-year are to a considerable extent
profits only by courtesy, a large part of them being
required for renewals. The business seems to be a peifect
sink for renewals. Six months ago the directors proposed
to put £3OOO to ordinary reserve fund and £2OOO to
renewal account ; the present accounts show that the
whole £5OOO eventually went into the renewal fund,
which is another way of writing it off. The present
reserves (largely nominal) consist of £7141 depreciat.on
fund £2025 redemption fund, £8332 renewal fund, and
£2103 undivided profit. Probably the only genuine
reserves are the redemption fund and undivided profit
together £4131. The directors now turn £3OOO into the
renewal and £l3OO into the depreciation fund ; and if
these two, as seems most likely, are of the nature of
writings-off, then they absorb more than the whole of the
half-year’s trading profit. One unpleasant result of the
half-year’s unfavorable experience has been to convert a
credit balance, just about sufficient to pay last December s
dividend, into an overdraft of £3640:

very drastic, and hardly justified by results or prospects.
Co.’s monthly returns have been ranging between 4 and
7dwt., usually showing a loss. So far as one can judge,
there is no improvement in view. Treatment plant is
getting pretty ancient and played out, and can t last
much longer. Rich ore said to have been located b.v
diamond drilling four or five years ago appears to be a
myth. Yet if calls are met, management will have
£42,440 to play with, which is a nice little sum to handle.
Where shareholders come in it is hard to see.

To prove that there are still possibilities of rich
strikes in Vi.A., the Fenian, Meekathara, has just cleaned
up 286 tons for 13400 z. This is on the same line as Inglis-
toir Consols, which recently crushed 878 tons for 33180 z.
A lot of work is being done in the locality, and more is
likely to he heard of it.* # *
North White Feather, Kanowna (W.A.), is
having same experience as its neighbor, Main Reefs. Beef
has been cut in shaft at 575 ft., 6in. wide and of no value.
This pretty well settles fate of concern, as Main Reef also
proved no good below 600 ft. This reef has always been
erratic and patchy, with short pay shoots and long' blanks.
It seems to be the fate of quartz reefs in W.A. to peter
out or lose their gold at comparatively shallow depths.
Mine is all right for some time yet, but can have no per-
manency, judging from all indications.
Boulder Deep Levels, Kalgoorlie, is very poor
where lode lias been cut at 1100 ft. In east drive lode is
broken up, with a tendency to make into the footwall.
In west drive it is not much better, and in both is only
worth Ito 2dwt. per ton. Of course lode may improve on
being'driven on as it did at 900 ft., but there is no cer-
tainty about this. Co. must be getting to the end of its
funds, and will probably have to face a fresh reconstruc-
tion. It is a pity it was not amalgamated with Hannan s
Star which would save an enormous amount in adminis-
tration and directors’ fees.
* * *
Golden Pole, Davyhurst (W.A.), has cut the
reef at 400 ft.—small, badly defined, and of low grade.
This is exactly what was predicted by those w'ho judged
from what had happened to other mines in the district.
The pay shoot is pitching north, away from the shaft,
and may vet be found all right, as predicted by Nat
Harper : nevertheless, some at least of the insiders have
been unloading to make themselves safe.
*‘* * *
K ! il°*urli (W.A.) shows a substantial advance
on its monthly output, figures for last three months
bein<>- 33930 z., 44690 z., and 54120 z. Addition to treat-
ment plant is now practically complete, and output
should be bigger in future. Mine continues to develop
satisfactorily, and, as extensions to plant are not likely t >
be made in future, bigger divs. may be looked for. Tins
is one of the most consistent and best-managed mines on
the field.

Manager Delprat estimates that the B.H. Prop,
has. 3,200,000 tons of “ordinary quality ore” in sight.
Estimates for past five years have been :
1900 .. 4,558,000 tons
1903 .. .. 4,250,000 „
1905 .. .. 3,200,000 ~
In five years the reserves have been reduced by 1,358,000
tonsbut as 2,650,000 tons have during that tune been
mined, it appears that, approximately, 1,300,000 tons
Pave been developed. In other words, half the ore treated
has come from reserves ; half from new developments.
Present reserves would last rather less than 5J years if no
new developments occurred ; and share market evidently
hasn’t thought that too .comforting. In past two years
divs. have been £408,000, or an average of £204,000 per
year. And present market value of mine is about
£2,400,000, or about 12 years’ divs. at the rate Of-the
payments during last two years. In view of that, 5j
years’ reserves are certainly not good enough. Of course
profits just at present are on a much higher scale. Net
profits last half-year were £147,671, or 9s. lid. per ton ; so
if those profits can be maintained, the reserves are worth
£1 587,0 0, or £>. 13s. per share (present price, about
50s’:). The difference between 335. and 50s. is the discount
on future developments. Part of the 335. is certainly
speculative, too. Two years ago the co. was only netting
6s per ton for its ore ; the change in the metal markets
has.added a good part of the other 3s. lid. ; improved
processes have added the other part. But there is no
certainty that metal markets will stay up wheie they aie.
Figures, however, only show how absurd it is to
regard even the B.H. Prop, as an investment—unless you
take the stated reserves and the 6s. per ton as a basis ;
and in that case you needn’t worry an} r further,, because
vou couldn’t get the shares at twice the money it wou.d
work oat at. Regarding the stock as a speculation, here
are a few things to gamble on '
(1) Zinc. Worth hardly anything to the co. so far, but,
on two years’ more-or-less experimental work, a big plant
is now under weigh. And there’s a sort of side-wager as
to the price of zinc. In 1901 it wasdown to £l6. A\eiage
price this year has been about £24. Not two years before
it got down to £l6 it stood awhile at £2B 10s. And in ’95
it sold at £l4 15s. That’s the sort of metal it is.
(2) Reserves. As shown above, in the past (five years,
half the ore has come from new developments, Assuming
the same thing to go on, then the present reserves,
instead of lasting 5J years, would last 10j yealjs or there-
abouts.
(3) Probable future developments in new country.
When the estimate was made the 1000 ft. level had been
pierced by a drive from a little north of Delprat shaft to
very near the Block 10 boundary. At 800 ft. level the
same. The 650 ft, level has been taken to Patterson shaft,
a little north of Delprat’s. Now, from Delprat shaft to
Block 14 boundary is 1700 ft. This has not been touched.
Therefore there is 1700 ft. of the mine unexplored below
about 600 ft. ; and at the other end of the mine the 800 ft.
level is the main source of supply at present, while, where
tried, the lode at 1000 ft. level is wider than it is at. 800 ft.
It is generall v supposed that the lode.is not as good in the
northern end (towards Block 14) as in the southern end
(towards Block 10). But there is no certainty about it.
A start has just been made to explore this art a.
(4) Still with regard to the reserves. How much ore is
estimated as lying between 800 ft. and 1000 ft. even south
of Delprat shaft ? The lode has not been opened up to
any extent here—little more than preliminary work has
been done ; yet the value of tie estimate published
depends very largely on the extent to which this ore lias
been reckoned in. If it hasn't been reckoned in to any
great extent, pending exploratory crosscuts, then a very
little further work might easily add at least 25 per cent,
to the stated reserves. In sljort, the estimate of reserves,
in the bald way in which it is put forward, is worth about
2d. ; and the movement of shares in consequence of the
published estimate rests upon a twopenny basis.
People interested in B.H. Block 14 should watch
those northern explorations in the deeper levels of the
B. H. Prop. They may mean more to Block 14 than to the
bi{>' mine. '
* * ' *
Broken Hill Junction is proving again what a
ffreat ffambling stock it is. Six or seven weeks ago, with
shares at 2s. (and they had been at Is. Bd.), Bulletin men-
tioned the mine as the cheapest thing on the Barrier at
the price. Go. just after this went down to the 837 ft. of
neighboring Junction North, got at once into a good,
clean, solid sulphide body of better than average grade,
and has been in it ever since. The drive is now about 60ft.
long, and the stuff has lately been going over 27 per cent,
lead and 20oz. silver. The B.H. South makes its fine divs.
out of ore averaging under 17 per cent, lead and Boz.
silver ; and the B.H. Prop, ore is worth about the same.
Now Junction shares are having scores of sales at 6s. 3d.,
and have not stopped going yet. Already there is talk of
“ the early resumption of milling operations.” As usual.
This is just what makes the Junction a gamble. There is
no mine on the Barrier that needs to be opened out more
patiently and systematically before a wheel of the mill is
turned and none ever gets less systematic opening. The
mine is managed from Adelaide, and, in proportion to the
size of the city, Adelaide’s Stock Exchange is far too big.
You can see it and hear it all over the place, in every
board-room ; with the painful consequence that very few
Adelaide mining co.’s pursue a policy which ends in regular
divs. Even- when they get hold of a good mine, they rush
it to death, and then bump goes the market.

Divorce Law, as expounded by Justice
a’ Beckett in the Vic. Court, entails an awful
necessity for watchfulness on the part of a husband
who has drawn a blank in the matrimonial
lottery. In this case—
Respondent had shown hy her conduct that she was
not under any restraint of ordinary morality. She was a
loose woman who would easily yield to any temptation
that offered. Her husband had left her unprotected and
alone, and he must have known that in such -circum-
stances it was exceedingly probable that she would mis-
conduct herself. He (Justice A’Beckett) believed the
woman had been ready to live with her husband, and their
life might have been a happy one if that had happened.
The judge, in refusing a divorce to this petitioner,
advised him that he might have better luck at his
next attempt if he were to live with his wife in
the meantime. Of course, he musn’t “ conduce to
her Jail ” by leaving home for a month on business,
or anything of that sort. But if he should catch
her misconducting herself when he returns home
from a lodge meeting, or from a brief visit to the
tobacco shop round the corner, he will be justified
in lodging another petition. Even the husband of
a loose woman is allowed to go off duty for an
hour or so.
One part of Sydney harbor smelt worse
than a land-agent’s business for a few days lately.
It seems that its great natural resources don’t run
to the length of keeping this country supplied
with onions. When Australia’s weather happens
along in a succession of good patches, the crop is
something tremendous, and the grower piles up
the fruit in a corner, and lets it stay there. This
year it has been the wrong sort of weather, and
the white grub has been extra-hungry, so Sussex -
street prepared for an onion-famine by jumping
up prices about 50 per cent. Hitherto, when
the same thing has happened, Australia has
eaten its cucumber with onions from Egypt,
or the Straits Settlements, or China, and some-
times from Italy and America ; this season the
pushful Jap announced that he had some of the
fruit to sell, extra good, and j ust the sort for Aus-
tralia. What the cargo was like when it was put
on board only the shippers know ; but when that
trial shipment was opened up in the harbor, the
boss faintly whistled up the least particular lot of
scows he knew of, and rushed the onions out into
the Pacific Ocean. So for the present the prospects
of the ties between this country and Britain’s ally
being strengthened by a trade in Monkey onions
are off.
* * « *
It may be set down as an axiom that if a
man is caught fiercely kissing a woman in the
street she is anybody but his wife. In a case
before the Melbourne court last week, however,
the exception came along to prove the rule.
Sidney Martin, charged with insulting behavior—
i.e. kissing a woman violently in the street—
established the fact that she was his wife, and was
discharged accordingly. He had better luck than
a New England captain of 150 years ago, who was
flogged and imprisoned for kissing his wife on a
wharf. The act ranked as lewd and irreligious
behavior in that dry old wilderness of moral
precepts and baked beans.

A suggestive specimen of Victoria’s “ well-
paid public servants” wandered through Judge
Molesworth’s Insolvency Court in Melbourne
lately. He joined the service in ’B6 at £7B a year,
and in 17 years reached the noble maximum of
£l2O. In ’99 he backed a bill of £lO for a fellow
employee, who was subsequently sacked, and he
was left to carry the infant. The original £lO was
borrowed from Hayling. After payment of £4
the borrower fell into arrears. Each time he
failed to pay the instalments a fresh bill was made
out with interest added, and by the time he had
paid £2B he still owed Hayling £lO. Then he
borrowed £lO from Goodman and got rid of
Hayling. But Goodman was much like his prede-
cessor, and by the time the harassed borrower had
paid him £3O he still owed him £lO. Goodman
seized some furniture, but as there was still £5
owing, the victim borrowed £5 from Davis at
120 per cent, interest, giving a bill for £7,
and got clear of Goodman. Finally he
borrowed £4 more from Davis—£9 altogether
—and after having paid £7 he still owes
Davis £l2. Then, just as he was fairly on the
road to lunacy, his tradespeople creditors made
him insolvent, and he filed a schedule showing
debts £52, assets ss. Moleswortli remarked that
the sharks had had a good old time, and, though
he felt a trifle sorry for the butcher and baker, he
would grant a certificate.

Melbourne brewers have begun to feel the
competition of the Co-operative Abbotsford
Brewery, and have commenced a fight which
promises to be long and tough. A recent reduc-
tion of 3d. per dozen in the price of bottled beer
has been followed by a drop of ss. per hogshead in
draught. The Co-op. brewery promptly followed
suit. Now the companies are forming a pool or
combine, and their latest fulmination is a promise
that, in the effort to smash the co-operators, “a
lqng sleever will be sold for a penny.” If neither
side weakens there should be a joyous time and
numerous arrests in Melbourne this summer, and
the public should face next autumn with a red-
dened nose and an excited aspect.

More of the casual ways of Australia. A
far-west (N.S.W.) coach pulled up, the other day,
at the Dry Lake (they name some of these places
with a grim humor out-back). The passengers
got out, stretched their legs, then sat down to
tea. One of them reckoned that as good a
time as any to cut his throat; so he laid hold of a
table knife and began to carve himself. As usual,
it was a terribly blunt knife, and he hadn’t half
done the job when his fellow-eaters objected.
They were a couple of nasty gashes he made ; but
what was the use of having a fuss about it, or
stopping at the Dry Lake, or anything ; so he got
on to the coach sociable-like with the rest of them,
and they bore him no ill-will except for spoiling
their tea a bit.

Another imported curse has struck Aus-
tralia, an employee at the Footscray (Vic.) mills
having died of strongylosis, a vitiation of the
blood caused through inhaling dust containing dry
ova of the strongylus, a microscopic organism so
far found only in cotton grown in Egypt. As yet
little is known of the powers and possibilities of
this parasite, and whether he has come to stay or
not is uncertain, but if he has it is certain that no
border fence will keep him out.
A tale of
sin and fi-
nance :
There is not

He came into
the back yard
of the wayside
house looking
heartbroken
and world-
weary. He had
not eaten for
many days, he
said, and that
he had not
washed for
many w'eeks
was obvious.
He impressed
it upon the
“kind lady”
that he was no
loafer, but a
victim of man’s
inhumanity to
man. He want-
ed work, he
begged and
prayed for
work, his
tongue liter-
ally hung out
for hard labor,
but people
turned him
from their
gates and
cursed him. So
it happened
that he was
perishing for
want of bread,
and if the kind
lady would
give him a meal
and a shilling
he would show
his earnestness
and honesty by
chopping up
the load of
wood at the
side of the
house. The kind
lady was trust-
ing and in-
genuous. She
gave him a
meal, and she
gave him a
shilling', and for two hours an axe was heard going
on the wood-heap. Then the chopping ceased, and
another sad, hungry-eyed man come to the kitchen door
and claimed a meal and a shilling. “But,” said the kind
lady, “ you are not the man.” “ No,” said the new appli-
cant, “the man who was cutting the wood said he was
too weak to do it, and told me he’d been promised a shil-
ling and a meal for the job, and that I could have it for
3d.” The first beat had sold his dead horse to a brother
in adversity.

A peculiar instance of Parliamentary pres-
sure on the Vic. Railway Department occurred
last week. The stationmasters at Flinders-street
and Princes Bridge got word from the Legislative
Assembly that members were sitting late to dis-
pose of Watt’s Scripture Instruction Bill, and
were desirous of having the last trains on the
suburban lines detained for their convenience.
This message seemingly was law to the station-
masters. They kept the trains waiting half-an-
hour, or more, beyond the regulation times of
departure, and being ashamed to admit the cause
of the delay, they merely gave dumb insolence or
curt “cheek ”to people who asked a reason. Pre-
sently, at about twenty minutes past midnight, a
pair of deadheads came along as an advance guard
to announce that several other members would
arrive shortly. When they had all arrived, there
was a little further delay lest one or two more
might toddle in and be left lamenting. Finally
the railway service did its duty by the public, and
they all went snorting away to their destination.
The Assembly had knocked off its late sitting at
12.5 a.m. It might have been half-an-hour, or an
hour, later. The question is, up to what time
would the stationmasters have considered it a fair
thing to keep the common fare-paying public
waiting ?
Brisbane’s milk supply seems to be
deliberately exempted from the obligations of
honesty by the courts. Magistrates insist, when
a vendor is before the beak, upon the inspector
proving that the adulterated milk produced was
purchased by him, although it was actually shown
in some cases that the money for the seized sam-
pies had been offered and refused by the vendor.
The Full Court, too, recently held that the prose-
eution could not succeed unless the article was
shown to have been actually exposed for sale, and
that milk m a cart running its rounds did not con-
statute an exposure. While this sort of humbug is
going on the milkmen are selling milk daily with
additions from the Enoggera tap. Home Secretary
Airey favors amendments to the Act to make it
really effective.

Sydney M unicipal Council has approved of
Mayor Allen Taylor’s scheme to resume the slum

the Council scornfully rejected the suggestion of

the slum was taken over, the owners should not be

held—and most reasonably so—-that a man
®houldn t be paid for allowing his property to
degenerate till it made the city a bye-word, and
that it was putting a premium on filth, disease,
and Chinamen when a landlord could get 10 per

bought out to save Sydney’s good name. Slum

the fi'entleman who had power to help Willis. . . .
Mr. Crick : The hon. member is an old liar. . . .
Mr. J. H. Young : Tell as many lies as you like. . . .
The rest of the debate follows :
A member got upon hia feet and said that he would make
A few remarks anent the way this land of ours was run.
Another member said he thought the country ought to
take
Strong measures with that member—what he needed was
a gun.
But someone yelled across the floor, “ The member is an
ass ! ”
The Speaker murmured “ Order there, and let the mem-
ber speak ! ”
And someone said he recognised the member’s brow was
brass,
And added that the member was a quite inhuman freak.
Another member spoke : “I know the time you were in
gaol,
And if you had your rights it is in gaol you still would be ;
Instead of boozing round the pubs and cadging pints of
ale.”
Just then someone said the member should be hanged
upon a tree,
A member said the Ministry had neither brains nor ruth,
An honorable member said that it both lied and stole.
Then someone called the member aperverter of the truth,
And said that he could eat him, and would gladly eat
him whole.
Someone remarked the members were devoid of cere,
brum,
And that their cerebellum was an absent substance too ;
Then an honorable member made a clatter like a drum,
And an honorable member cackled like a cockatoo.
Also someone said a member was a whisky-sodden wreck,
And that in a dismal future he on Tophet’s rim would

A paragraph is wandering around Aus-
tralian newspaper offices just now about “the
luckiest fellow above ground ” ; and his luck lies
in his having been smashed up more than anybody
else the writer ever heard of, and is yet alive, or
partially so. It seems that every finger he has
has been fractured, and his skull has been broken
into twice, and he has been near the middle of two
or three gunpowder explosions, and a mate who
was digging his corpse out from under a slip of
gravel put his pick into his head and found that
he wasn t a corpse ; also he had internal abcesses
which kept him two years m hospital, and now a
truck on the Mt. Lyell (Tas.) railway has had
an argument with him and landed him in the
Lormanstcm Hospital, where the name of 1. H.
Wells is over his bed. And this is “the luckiest
fellow above ground ! Some people seem to have
curious ideas about luck.
The case of the bankrupt Waddell, now
doing an indefinite term in prison for contempt in
refusing to account for some money, received
little attention in N.S.W. Legislative Council
when Hawken, M.L.C., called for mercy. But
there is room for argument, nevertheless, about a
system which may amount to perpetual imprison-
ment without appeal to a jury. Insolvency Judge
Noel, in Melbourne, ordered an apparently contu-
macious bankrupt to gaol one time, and it was
proved afterwards that the bankrupt’s brain was
disordered on the occasion. Judge Harding, of
Queensland, once ordered a young fellow named
Swanwick to be imprisoned for life. His crime
was also contempt of court in threatening Sam
Griffith, then prosecuting Swanwick’s brother.
The Judge had power to punish without a jury,
but public opinion forced him to reduce the term
to 10 years, and more public opinion, with a threat
from Parliament that it would withdraw the
power of summary punishment for contempt,
brought about a still further reduction.

The fisheries and game branch of the
Victorian Customs Department is just now worry-
ing over a knotty point. Victoria has a close
season—from August 15—for cod and perch, but
fish agents and salesmen are allowed a week’s
grace in which to dispose of consignments already
on hand. On August 23rd a load, valued at £BO,
reached Melbourne from Swan Hill, whereupon,
the time-limit having expired, the agents sent it
on to the Customs Department, and washed their
hands of all responsibility. The trouble is that
the fish were caught in the Murray, which, in law,
is a N.S.W. stream, and if the department pro-
hibits the sale of Cornstalk fish in Melbourne
because of a Victorian close season, that bilious
State Frights person, Premier Carruthers, may
start an insurrection and a revolution right off.
Or he may appeal to the law and carry the case—
and the fish —around the courts for a long while.
And meanwhile the fish is getting no fresher.

About 70 old ladies of both sexes assisted
at the formation of a branch of the Women’s Aus-
tralian National League in a Victorian country
town, a week or so back. Mrs. Barrington
held forth in the approved style—told
the poor old cookies that their farms
were to be wrested from them ;
and was particu-
larly emphatic
on the point that
Socialism was
going to blow up
the sanctity of
marriage, and
dynamite the
happy home-life
so essential to
the building up
of a great nation.
And now some
cynics point a
sarcastic finger
at the fact that a
childless gentle-
man was in the
chair, a childless
lady was elected
president, a lank
spinster is secre-
tary, a buxom
maiden on the for-
lorn side of 40 is
treasurer, and the
Other office-bearers
will not be pressed
for time on account
of home duties.
These are the people,
say the cynics, who
are to save our happy
homes, and they don t
seem to have a real
home among them—
only flats and board-
ing-houses and hotels.
The most curious syna-
gogue in Australia is a fine one,
of Asiatic design, built to hold about
a hundred, in the private garden of a
St. Kilda mansion. The Hebrew millionaire’s
family cleared from this residence. It is a fashion-
able boarding-house now, and the synagogue, with
all its windows superbly pictured, is the billiard-
room.

A case which the State Frights people ought
to be proud of has just been happening with the
help of three Judges and a waggon-load of lawyers.
A Victorian took out a patent in N.S. Wales, and
then had a row over it with a co. which has an
office in Melbourne and a mine in N.S. Wales.
Half the waggon-load of lawyers argued that, as
the Victorian patentee had a row with a Victorian
co., Victoria was the proper place to settle the
trouble; the other half argued that a Victorian
court couldn’t deal with a row that hadn’t hap-
pened in Victoria but nominally in N.S. Wales.
Two of the three Judges said they couldn’t deal
with the case; the other one said he thought they
could ; so the decision went with the two. If
some other court doesn’t say that the two J udges
are wrong, the Victorian will therefore have to
begin proceedings over again, this time against
the registered agent of the co. in N.S.W., though
the registered agent most likely doesn’t know any
more of what the row is all about than King Billy
of Croajingolong does. When State Frights are
buried 100 ft. deep, and Australia lives under one
law, one citizen won’t have to chase another citi-
zen half over the continent in order to find out
where the court hangs out that is competent to
deal with his troubles.

It is alleged that the traveller who is pur-
sued by wolves often throws luggage overboard to
attract the attention of the animals while he
increases his start. It looks as if retreating land-
agents sometimes threw boxes and Safe Deposits
overboard for much the same purpose.
The
old copying
clerk, generally
with a mild,
patient face and
hushed voice,
has been trod-
den under foot,
and swept out
of almost all
public offices.
He was a sad-
dening spec-
tacle at the best
of times, brain
hardly moving,
fingers mechani-
cally working,
clothes thread-
bare, and stom-
ach nearly
empty. I was
reminded of him
the other day,
however, when
a solicitor hand-
ed me a bill of
costs —not costs
against me, but
as an interest-
ing document he
was sending out
to a valued
client. There
was the copying
clerk all alive at
6d. a folio !
“Ha!” I said,
“so the old in-
stitution still
survives.” “Copy,
ing,” he repiled—
“copying? Of
course, they’re
all typed now. A
typist does all
that class of
work, and much
better, and at a
fraction of the
cost.” “How
much a folio?”
“Oh, hardly
worth mention-
ing ; on a lot it
doesn’t come to a
penny.” “ But see here, you charge the same price
to your client as when the work was done per hand
by the tired old rack of bones.” “I never thought
of it,” he replied, ” but we all do the same. It’s the
established figure. And besides,” after a pause,
“it’s only fair we should profit by the advance of
knowledge.” “And your clients? Do they
profit by the advance of knowledge?” But
another human 6s. Bd. worth just then came in,
and the subject dropped.

The boundless ignorance of common things
which the law assumes when betting cases are
brought up before it, and which it hardly ever
assumes in any other circumstances, is amazing.
Over and over again the law has declared that it
couldn’t convict a betting man because, while the
statutes forbid the use of any place for this kind
of gamble, the learned bench of horse-hair can’t
find out what is a “place.” The simple and
obvious explanation—that everywhere is a place,
and nowhere is not a place, and that there can’t
be a man without a place for him to be in—has not
occurred to the law yet. Now, in Adelaide,
a betting prosecution has failed because the
defendant laid 3 to 1, and even after the
court had dragged its immense intellect round
and round the question it couldn’t decide what
“3 to 1 ” meant. It knew well enough, but in
this particular business there is a diseased fashion
of pretending not to know. It is almost a pity
that the courts don’t lay themselves out to be this
same special kind of ass in all cases, and then
perhaps the disease would work its own remedy.
Suppose an ordinary case of homicide to proceed
like this. Counsel for the defence: “I submit
that the crime of manslaughter has not been pro-
perly defined.” The other learned apparition :
“The charge is one of killing a man.” “ I would
ask that the learned gentleman should explain
what he means by a man.” “Dunno; he has
been called a two-legged animal without feathers.”
“Well, what is killing him, anyhow?” “ Vio-
lently depriving him of life.” “What is life?”
“ Dunno.” Case falls through owing to the insuf-
ficiency of the indictment, which only sets forth
that something undefined was deprived of some-
thing not defined. Besides, the alleged crime was
allegedly done at, say, Adelaide, which is said to
be a place, and innumerable betting decisions have
laid down that no one knows what is a place, so the
case falls through twice over. Also, the alleged
act was allegedly done on the 10th July, which is
said to be a date, and a date is vaguely described
as a measure of time, and no one can say clearly
what is time. In default of anyone handing up
some time in a jug for the Bench’s inspection, the
case breaks down some more.
* * * *
Although the arguments in the “corset
case ” were concluded before the Adelaide Supreme
Court last November, the S.A. Chief Justice has
not yet given judgment. The law costs, it is
estimated, have reached £20,000, and the corsets
about which all the fuss was made are not now
quite the glass of fashion. Justice Way has, in
29 years, only had one of his decisions upset, and
he doesn’t want the experience repeated. So he
is walking carefully round his corset and viewing
it from all sides before committing himself.

COWEN : “ Vat is de best ting to do for phos-

“Alba” on the Jap.’s indemnity joke : —•
The Monkey mathematicians and strategists seem to
have built up the framework of their feverish invasion of
Manchuria and Korea with a large nine-figured indemnity
at foot to keep its uprights stiff, and to make it a more
efficient invader in future. The habit of paying huge
indemnities to invaders has grown upon the nations of
Europe, Russia excepted. Whenever a victorious army
wanders with its eagles and banners into the enemy’s
capital, it draws out a large paper, covered with a camel-
load of indemnity figures, and asks the other fellow
to sign it immediately. And the other fellow signs
cheerfully, lest the eagles and bayonets hold his land
and people for all time. The Jap., in his study of
European politics, has noted these facts with a glittering
eye. The waggon-loads, of indemnity rumbling from the
Russian Treasury have cast a smile over his sleep and
gladdened the hearts of his dreadfully impoverished sub-
jects. The yellow organ of the loan-monger and the cow-
trust man declares that a few billion roubles emptied into
the lap of Japan would be a square and gentlemanly deal;
it would cheer the brown man after his gallant rush for
the other fellow’s territory. In my small way lam glad
that the Bear will pay nuffln’ for the honor of having its
face scratched and its tail violently pulled. Behind its
torn scalp and war-bitten ears is one luminously sane
spot. With a vast and unplayable wicket guarding its
colossal interior, a dozen Mukdens are merely affairs of
outposts where the safety of Moscow and St. Petersburg
are concerned. Oyama is advertising another crushing
blow to be delivered somewhere in the Manchurian mud,
with the intention of hurrying up the indemnity. The
spectacle of 400,000 monkeys squatting on the edge of
China, screaming for indemnity, would make a Voltaire
laugh.

“ G-. Elburg ” : Since the capture of the
S.A. Premiership by Labor-leader Price, capital
has become very restless and uneasy. At Port
Adelaide the funnels used on the mooring ropes of
vessels to prevent the landing of the bubonic rat
are reversed by order of the new Ministry to pre-
vent capital getting on board secretly and making
its escape. The other day, when passing one of
Adelaide’s largest foreign banks, I heard a loud,
unreliable report, and £1,000,000 burst out of a
vault and tore down the street to catch the Port
train. This was the result of an incautious re-
mark on the part of a clerk about the “Labor
fellahs.” Now bank clerks are forbidden to men-
tion the Labor party on the premises, and the
managers hope to keep the dreadful news from
penetrating to where the cash is concealed.
LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Youth pauses, laughs, and speeds away. , .
Ah God ! if youth could only stay !
It seems’t was only yesterday
(So swiftly now the sad sands run)
I swore eternal troth to May
Devoutly, being twenty-one.
It seems ’twas only yesternight,
I and the exquisite Elise
Exchanged our vows (her eyes were bright!)
Beneath the crooning Pleiades.
It seems just now ’twas but to-day—
Say a few minutes since or so—
That Honor’s eyes first glanced my way;
And that was full five years ago !
Alas ! for poor dead yesterday !
For thirty-five amid this rust!
Ten years ago they buried May,
And now our very oaths are dust.
Alas ! for joyous yesternight!
For lithe Elise so fresh and fair.
She’s married. I(a luckless wight!)
Forget the color of her hair.
Alas ! for dreams that come too late !
Time scores his jests across my brow.
I’m crabbed and old and out-of-date...
Honor can never love me now !
Youth pauses, laughs, and speeds away...
Ah, God ! if youth could only stay /

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, August 29, 1905.
My Dioak Abint.—
You can almost see the gap left in the waters of
Farm Cove by the departure of the Panther. Its
officers had such flattering manners and made
such beautiful turtle necks over one. Women do
appreciate the making of turtle necks, and none
can make them so gracefully as this or that Edel
von Something. One of the torpedo captains
(with the distinctive Edel prefixed to his name) is
a stamp-collector of great ferocity. A battered
old stamp that is supposed to be one of the last of
its familv is pursued by him as Sir Galahad pur-
sued the Holy Grail, and if he can hear of an old
postcard which came over with the Conqueror he
will chase it on foot from here to Finland.
Captain Leslie Wilson (Excellency Rawson’s
staff) is back from his holiday in North
Queensland, where he has been duck-shooting
and studying hides, horns and hair—going
the whole ox, so to speak. He didn’t stay
long enough to get the true ox-expression. I know
one man who went for some years on a cattle
station, and the effecton him was aprofound disgust
for beef—roast or otherwise. He got to hate his
meat through meeting it lowing on its way to the
waterhole in the morning, then seeing it on his
platter at night.
Signorina Mimi Fiorelli’s concert brought an
audience of a kind that doesn’t often light up the
Y.M.C. A. Itwasofthe “bestbutter” and it melted
over the cinnamon-cornplexioned Mimi. Three
of the Panther’s officers, some of our own naval
men and women, and several Dangars were in the
foreground of the hallscape. Such attendance
argues the interest of Lady Northcote in the
singer. But Miss Fiorelli’s mother was a some-
body from Goulburn before she went to England
and married her Milanese; so the friends of her
school days are coming out to applaud the
daughter, and her powerful dramatic soprano.
-Talking of sopranos : Violet Mount’s departure
and the most probable going of the Fiorelli will
leave us very short of good top-notes for public
hearing. There’s a glorious soprano voice (the
adjective is a large one, but it’s quite a good fit)
making a Strathfield home melodious. The
owner of the voice is Mrs. “Willie” McDonald.
I didn’t hear her in the days when Dan O’Connor
used to speak elegies about her singing, but it's
quite good enough these days for persons who have
not heard a soloist from the Nine Choirs.
Mr. and Mrs. T. M. Slattery are in America.
In his letters to his friends here the departed
expresses his intention to return some day and
pay his creditors in full. His is of a sanguine tem-
perament.
Before the Lands Commission, at the opening of
the famous box, Mrs. Willis, her face discharged of
all expression, kept a steadfast gaze on the Judge s
countenance. She has a good complexion and a
tightened mouth. Her short, plump person was
clad in brown with brown furs. She looks as if
she were a good mother to the five daughters with
“the bubbling spirits,” who, on Mr. Melville’s
authority, were doing the Pitt-street shops with
her what time the picture of Australian domes-
ticity broke that emotional.gentleman right up.
Several “progressive dinners” are promised for
our race carnival. The first (so far as I know)
given in Sydney occurred last week. A merry
party ate seven single courses at as many hostels,
commencing at the Australia, then “ progressing”
by means of the penny trams to the Metropole,
the Wentworth, Petty’s, and other places, finish-
ing up at the host’s house with coffee and
liqueurs. It was a man’s party, but the future
progressive dinners will consist of Shes
and Hes. One group declares that it will
finish up , the meal at Watson’s Bay. Well,
after a tram ride to that suburb, where
the breakers leap in foam, and the ghosts of the
Dunbar-drowned ride on the wind and mingle
with the spirits that used to be in Premier Robert-
cellar, the progressives will be ready for all
the courses they can get. They will be hungry
enough to eat cold cabbage. It is a silly idea,
though—just a fad to get, in a most expensive way,
the; same want of satisfaction which can be more
economically acquired by dining where they keep
a dead waiter.
Last Wednesday’s was a crowded afternoon.
The Voice Breathed through thickets of orange
flowers, and the Wedding March got a good
hearing. There were five weddings, and at the
two principal ones seven hundred guests were
assembled.. Miss Mildred Coffee, eldest daughter
of Mr. F. Coffee, of “Iroquois,” Chatswood,
nnrried Dr. "D. Kelly, a young North Sydney
practitioner. Miss Elaine Whiting, a daughter of
the senior partner of Henry Bull and Co., wedded
Dr, Waugh, of Parramatta. Doctors seem to be
a marrying tribe. I believe that a doctor pretty
well must marry if he aspires to a good family
practice.
Bridal gowns must be a severe trial to
their makers. It is so difficult to introduce an
original element into their creation. But Miss
Coffee’s gown was, I am told by those experienced
in such things, Just It. It was of white satin
with half a mile of raised roses of chiffon, and
bertha, panel and sleeves of Honiton lace
Nothing original in all these as such, but the way
the skirt floated, as if of its own volition, and the
curves of the decorations, and the scheme of the
lace draping were so many delights. The girl
inside it was a willowy, graceful bride, black-
haired, magnolia-complexioned, a good musician
and a tireless “ goer ” on the waxed floor.
For the last three months a section of Sydney-
siders has spent most of its gossip hours in invent-
ing and circulating lies about one of the leading
merchants in this city. Persons he wouldn't
know from a turkey buzzard profess to have re-
ceived his confidences on domestic matters. Per-
sons his daughters just say “ How d’ ye do ? ” to
have been told such things by those daughters.
Last week the merchant was supposed to have lost
his level head to a sweet young thing,- “and,” said
one excited Sapphira, “ he has just rushed by with
her, all veiled and muffled up, in a motor-car.”
An hour later Sapphira and her listener were
drinking tea on the verandah of a view-of-the-
blue hotel when the motor car snorted to a stand-
still and the fair incognita was helped out by her
“ admirer.” Sapphira breathed like the tyre of a
bicycle when a pin has been driven into it. The
veiled one took off her veil, and nodded coldly
to Sapphira, who said disgustedly “Why, she’s
his daughter.”
N.S.W. ladies’ golf championship has changed
hands. Miss Trevor Jones, who held it for two
years—since it began, in fact—was defeated by
Mrs. Aitken, another keen lady golfist, in the
final, by five-up, which is no relation at all to two-
up. The new champion is wife of a well-known
city miller, and, though both she and he are
players of repute and tonnage, the defeat of the
holder of the title surprised the followers of the
game.
Mr. David Watterson, editor of Melbourne
Argus, and his niece, Miss Conway, are at the
Australia. The editor man has made a slow, and,
by all the sawbones who attended him, quite un-
expected recovery from a bad attack of appen-
dicitis.
The sap is up at 76 Pitt-street, Sydney, where
the Royal Art Society is holding its Spring exhi-
bition. Such sappy pictures, shrill green as to
grass and shrieking green as to early leaf and bud-
ding twig. Dreaming pools, emerald seas, naked
girls, mermaids and other objects to which the
young person’s fancy lightly turns when September
is next week and the person has learnt the trade,
more or less, of using colors. The National
Gallery has bought work by Tristram, Minns
and Alice Hambidge. Last is an Adelaide girl.
I liked Helen Hambidge’s “Cousin Kate” better
than any other picture of its kilid shown. It is
the head of a pansy-eyed girl with a black,hat
on her russet hair. The “Lady Gwendoline,”
acquired by the National Gallery, is very pretty-
pretty. Norman Carter’s portrait of his
brother is named “ The ’Cellist,” and is pro-
nounced by some of the to
head the list of portrait - successes. The
’cellist’s nervous face is full of musicianly
feeling. Fred Leist has a red-haired mermaid on
a swing of seaweed. Tristram has three red-
haired mermaids in a romantic, tricky, grey-violet
seascape. Gerald Fitz Gerald has one large, red-
haired mermaid seated on a rock and laving her
forked tail in the ripples. Arid Percy Spence
has a mermaid and tailed baby in bronze.
In future no male artist ought to be allowed
to go swimming without a chaperon. Remember
Wells’ “ Sea Lady ” who stole a bathing dress to
hide her tail, and got into the house of a respect-
able family. When her kindly but shocked hostess
discovered the fraud she patted the tail. Aud
then remember what became of the young man !
In miniatures Mrs. Ada Whiting, of Melbourne,
takes the waffle or any other aristocratic bit of
pastry that goes to the successful. Her delicate
pictures showing middle-age, girlhood and child-
hood are triumphs of treatment of flesh tones,
expression, and dainty dress fabrics. Miss
Stoddart shows a good miniature portrait of Miss
Angel Merivale.
Andrew Mack’s last audience in Sydney had an
octopus grip on him. It wouldn’t take his good-
bye and gd home to its mattress, so the actor had
to tear himself away and eel himself through a
waiting throng into a hansom. He got one of the
finest floral trophies ever seen at Her Majesty’s.
It was a big map of the Continent fashioned of
Australian flowers and foliage, carrying the re-
quest “Come Back.” Arid it was a deliciously-
odorous piece of geography ! Merry Andrew didn t
prove much of a speech-maker on his final night.
His farewell remarks resolved themselves into a
quotation of something Miss Nance O’Neil had
said to him of the Australians just before he left
the States for Australia. The lady’s comment
included a fervent “My G°d, how l love them !”
(the Australians) —and it made hearers smile widely
when next morning’s report in the S.M. Herald
started the remark with “ Heavens ” instead of
the other interjection. Mr. Mack indicated Miss
O Neil’s presence in the o.p. box, and the general
stare turned in that direction. It’s now a slender
Nance O’Neil—a nine-stone or so Nance. The
gazers gasped as the tall, golden-topped figure rose
to allow Mr. Rankin to put on her cloak, showing
a figure from which all the heroic curves had
departed. Then she kissed the finger-tip kiss to
those in the Williamson box and vanished.
Collins Bros, and Co., of Clarence-street, are
issuing a new series of ladies’ writing tablets,
eminently suitable for the reception of Great

A “Redmond Waltz,” dedicated to the gentle-
man who lately visited these parts, is on view in
the music-shops. A waltz dedication is almost the
highest honor attainable in this country. The only
laurel that overshadows it is that of the person

and informs the public, in a column decorated
with his photo., how he was cured of 10 fatal
diseases by the use of Somebody’s Glad Globules.

Now that the bathing season is not far off, it

costume with its floating skirts is a thing of the

place.
Usually, to ask a friend to come to a lecture, is
to start him running. But a delightful lecturer,
as to style and material, is on the - platform in
Sydney this week. Reginald 1 ord is he named,
and he spent two years of his young life in the
Antarctic, on the Discovery. He didn t bring
any icicles back with him, but the lantern pictures
of ice formations, penguins, seals, sledging
expeditions are of absorbing interest, ihe dogs
that drew the sledges were brought to M.L., to
join the Discovery—-brought in the freezing cham-
bers of a vessel. They’d been born in below-zero
latitudes, yet the Antarctic killed them all.
The smartest-looking damsel at Rosehill races
on Saturday was Miss Macßean, of Melbourne.
She floated round with Mrs. Colin Stephen.
Miss Vinie Deloitte’s father died early this
week at Balmain, in the same house in which he
was born 65 years ago. He was one of a family
of twelve, but he hasn’t handed on the traditions
of his fathers ; the pretty little comic opera artiste
is an only child. Another death is that of Capt.
Young, at his station, Myall Creek. He used to
be aide-de-camp to Lord Hampden, and was
married to a daughter of General French.

Writes my Melbourne correspondent :
“Is the line going to stretch out to the very
crack of doom ? Another Aide is announced for
the G.-G. By common consent it is agreed that
the rubicund Share is the best Private S'ec. used
by a Vice-Regal. But he seems to want a lot of
help. Hussar Balmain returns to the vice-regal
caddy ranks, and still another —a brand new
person with a hyphen (Kerr-Pearse)—-is tagged on
to the staff. The G.-G., who isn’t as big physi-
cally as he might be, shouldn’t so extinguish him-
self with a body-guard of overwhelming gravity.
Quite five of the suite are waste material, and a
little man shouldn’t wear a suite that’s too big for
him ; it only aggravates his littleness.
“The Northcotes are arranging to have a full
roost for the Cup carnival, and a list of festivities
is in course of construction. The Jersey pair will
lodge at the St. Kilda-road quarters, probably, at
Cup time.
“ There was a smart crowd at Una Bourne’s off-
to-Europe concert. The pale gold pianiste faced
the occasion in white —a school-girl white, without
any romantic gleamings or subtle trails. Wattle
trophies in riotous profusion apd daffodils in
stately order were spread, after the final chords,
at the feet of the clever girl. The Cliveden
dowager sat in the places of the mighty, and she
wore her inky thatch coiled girlishly on the neck.
Violet chiffons, symbolic of a passing grief, flowed
gently about her.' Mrs. Norton Griniwade, who
always strikes a bold note in her expensive cover-
ings, this night allayed her ecstasy somewhat in
faint, moonlight blue chiffons and a black cloak—
the contrast of dead black and tremulous blue
being all right.
“ An elderly Melb. widower, who is a big buck

“A marriage with tartan trimmings and a fan-
fare of trumpets'was that of Mr. J. W. Leith-
Buchanan and Miss K. Isabel Porter last Wednes-
day. The groom -is very British and long and
drawlsome. The bride is long and trailsome, and
inherits none of her papa’s vast bulk. The ring
changed hands at St. Paul’s Cathedral, after which
an aristocratic detachment made a detour to the
Grand, where wattle-bowers sheltered the guests.
The leading bridesmaids were rather beauteous ;
Miss Nellie Porter has Egyptian features, large,
slumberous brown eyes and a soft, scarlet mouth,
and Miss Nellie Reid is plump and lovely.
“Great ructions in a certain ill-managed co.
Those in the know are waiting for a violent
wrench. A beauty is the bone of contention, so
they say.
“The Brough-Flemmings had a fairly-crowded
last night. Mrs. Brough, who made a little
speech on behalf of her invalided husband and
partner Flemming, came in for a laurel hoop, arid
ended her benediction with a sob that touched the
genuinely sympathetic house.
“An unhappy male complains of a She-Club
that throws its Egyptian cigarette butts out of a
high window on to the unwitting pedestrian
below. He was meandering along Collins-street
in a spring mood when he suddenly felt something
lodge in the dent of his Panama hat. He shook
his top-piece, but nothing fell, and feeling
no weight, he thought no more about it till
his head was on fire—or at least breaking into
sparks. Then he removed the Panama and a
handful of top-hair, and found a cigarette butt
had set the lot in a blaze. He asks me to kindly
give the incident full notice, ‘ and the fashionable
club that throws its smokes out of its window may
be induced to offer me a new hat.’

think of matrimony. Early September sees
several mating-pairs, notably Miss Marie Cooper

marriage comes off at Christ Church, St. Kilda.
“ The Mayoral dame gave a strictly worshipful

“Picture-fanciers wandered up to the Art

of solemn interest. It would be, to the common
eye a mere sketchy trifle with some atoning hints

ance, and floclt before it in mute regard.
“ The Dante Society is preening its feathers for
a flight into public notice. A Prmcelet (the Duke
of Genoa’s son) comes this way in sweet September,
and maccaroni is to be boiled in his honor. He is
only 21, and if he is as gay an Italian as was the
Duke of the Abruzzi—the gentleman who shirked
a church parade in his honor to take a nice girl
down to a National Bark picnic—he should be
popular in Melbourne.
“Dr. A. L. Kenny, a good bhoy indeed, is
steering his barque for Erin s Isle. The eye
specialist has identified himself so closely with
church affairs that he looks far more severely
righteous than the younger brother, who actually
is in Holy Orders. The Kenny brothers (priest
and doctor) are sons of a Bourke-street linen-
draper, who made a fortune in a small estab-
lishment devoted to the homeliest articles of
covering.
“ The inappropriateness of the bit of presen-
tation silver is constantly being demonstrated.
A music firm donated a set of entree dishes last
week to a sexagenarian retiring from toil with,
presumably, a sadly impaired digestion. A choir
has a way of giving to a marrying member an
alarm clock. There are constantly ludicrous in-
congruities among a bride’s catalogue of presents.
Should she be addicted to sewing, she is sure to
get a smoking outfit; if she is a whister, she gets
a complete lady’s companion. The girl who hasn’t
read a line of poetry since her Fifth Reader days,
is given, as a marriage trophy, a set of the most
occulf; poets, and looks up Arnold’s ‘ Light of
Asia’ for a few hints when her Chinese garden
lanterns get out of gear. The only person who
knows how to deal with the inappropriate offering
is she who bluntly asks the donors if they mind
very much if she changes the pot-pourri urn for a
coal-scuttle, or a set of porridge plates for flat-irons.
Of course, they can’t mind, and the delicate trifle
is packed back, and the solid domestic article is
dumped down in its place.
“ The Daffodil Show marked down for Wednes-
day promises to be the finest for many Springs.
Tiie Talbot dame, who has much of the deport-
ment of the golden bloom, attends to smile
approval on the beauties. The men roll up to
these shows in far greater proportion than the
skirted. But at the dog show the women will be
found in herds, gushing over the Persian tabbies
and stroking the pugs with the practised hand
that was mainly appointed to rock the cradle.
“The spectacle of Bigjohn Forrest struggling
through Ins Budget deliverance with beads of per-
spiration on his beetroot brow drew all the idlers
on Wednesday, and Dame Forrest strode in her-
self at the head of a trailing chiffon pack. (Mrs.
Isaacs trailed most.) Private Sec. Share looked
on, and a packed gallery gazed at a tumultuous
Minister in his heat-rash rolling off some amazing
numbers. After the performance there was a
Budget Tea, at which the Forrest followers spread
the marmalade and consumed the cream.
“ The airs and graces with which a certain little
widow approaches the second hitching-up make
one reflect how perenially young is love. She is
as excited about the bebe ribbons for her lingerie,
and the monograms for the pillow-shams, as if she
were learning the coquetries of the trousseau for
the first time.
“A pathetic tragedy was the suicide of Mrs.
Shanahan, a few weeks ago. The deceased was
the widow of the once wealthy squatter, and
daughter of the one-time Premier, John O’Sha-
nassy. A few years ago she was a bright, breezy,
interesting woman, but money losses and other
troubles preyed on her mind and resulted in
melancholia.
“‘The Cingalee ’ audience on Saturday night
nearly burst its respective stud and stay-lace as
the Comic Opera Co. favorites showed up one by
one in the brown scene, and the convalescent Miss
Rose Musgrove had a special welcome. That
bright young party has thinned considerably, but
is as energetic and cheeky as in the pre-typhoid
days.
“Many remarkable head-mounts were flaunted
at ‘ The Cingalee ’ first night. One young ma’am
flourished a scintillating reptile that coiled from a
parting at the left temple, rightover the top thatch*
to an effective twist on the nape of the neck.
Another more seasoned dame had a life-size pair
of sea-gull wings springing from the top up-
holstering in a very foolish fashion. A third
member of the adorning sex had a spiral diamond
erection, like a grotesque lightning-conductor,
from her chestnut roof. Others had specimen
roses punctuating the thatch of twining a thorny
and budding course through the padded puffs.

CONSUMPTION
Wasting Away for Years.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
Save Another Young Life.
“ I was just 15 when my blood started turning
to water,” said Miss Dora Whiting, 2 01iver-st.,
Ballarat. “ I grew piteously pale, thin and weak.
Everyone said I had Consumption. I looked the
picture of Death.
“One day, while tottering along on mother’s
arm, we passed two gentlemen, and I heard one
say, ‘ Poor little thing ! She is in Consumption 1 ’
Yet here I am to-day, as strong and healthy as
any girl in Australia —thanks to Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People.. They actually made
new blood for me. They built me up with every
dose. I can never praise them half enough. No
one knows better than mother how near death I
was.”
“Yes, I never expected her to live,” broke m
Mrs. Whiting. “ Day after day some new person
told me she had Consumption. Even her aunt,
Nurse O’Brien,” said so. Soon I had to acknow-
ledge it myself. I tried to make myself believe it
was something else, but it was no use. Dora was
plainly in a deadly Decline.
“ Every week she grew thinner and weaker,”
continued Mrs. Whiting. “She hadn’t thestrength
to walk. We had to lift her about like a baby. I
used to carry her out into the garden to lie in the
sun for hours. But I could never leave her alone,
for I never knew when she would faint. These
fainting spells left her stone cold like one dead.’’
“Yes,” said Miss Whiting herself, “Mother
used to cry her heart out, and I used to wish myself
dead. I was only making everyone about me
miserable. I was too weak to do anything for
myself. Soon my nerves went to pieces. I could
neither sleep nor eat. The smallest mouthful felt
as if it was choking me. All I lived on was fruit,
milk and'the like. No wonder I wasted away till
I looked like a skeleton. . .
“ No one knows what I suffered,” Miss Whiting
went on. “I always had a splitting headache and
sharp shooting pains under my arms. As for my
back, it was one dull, dragging ache the live-
long day. The least thing set my heart beating
like mad. My aunt who nursed me said I hadn’t
a pound of flesh on my whole body. My lips were
white, and black rings came under my eyes.
Everyone said I was in the last stages of Con-
sumption.”
“That is just what I told her mother, said
Nurse Margaret O’Brien, of Ligar St., Ballarat.
“ You could almost see through her arms and
hands. Her clothes hung on her like on a prop.
She had no appetite, but craved instead for pickles
and such things. After trying every treatment in
vain, I felt sure that nothing could save Dora from
a Consumptive’s grave.”
“ But, just when we were giving up hope, some-
one left a book at the door telling how Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills actually made new blood, ” Mrs. Whiting
resumed. “We knew that was just what Dora
wanted, so we got her some. People said she was
too far gone for even Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills to
save her —but I made up my mind to give them a
fair trial.”
“Yes, and the very first box gave me an appe-
tite,” said Miss Whiting. “ Somehow, I'dkJ not
feel half so down-hearted. In a week or so, I was
able to walk by myself. Headaches and backaches
did not trouble me nearly so much. Then I felt
every dose giving me new strength. I started
gaining in weight, and soon got bade my color.
Meanwhile, the new blood built up my lungs. At
last, to the surprise of all my friends in Ballarat,
I was able to go about as strong and well as any
girl in the district. When l)r. Williams’ Pink
Pills saved my life, they worked a regular miracle.”'
And Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills can do just as
much for every weak ailing nervous pale-faced
young woman who is slipping from anaemia into a
deadly Decline. Remember Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills don't act on the bowels. They don’t bother
with mere symptoms. They do only one thing,
but they do it well—they actually make new
blood. In that way they strike straight at the
root of all common blood diseases like anaemia,
indigestion, biliousness, headaches, backaches,
rheumatism, neuralgia, nervousness, palpitation
of the he art, and the special secret ailments and
irregularities of girls and women. But, of course,
you must get the genuine Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
—sold by all chemists and storekeepers and by the
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney, at 2s. 9d. a
box or six boxes 15s. 3d., post free. Write to that

George Lansell, the Bendigo quartz king,
-turned the corner into his 83rd year on August 25.
W. N. Willis has written an unpublished
romance and an unstaged drama. Both deal with
bush themes, and introduce a comic bilackfellow.
Ex-Commandant Price, who still presses
his pension claims on the Federal Government, is
haunted with the fear that Parliament will aim
low.
Said a Victorian insolvent: “I borrowed
from Paul and he robbed me, so I went to Peter
and he robbed me too.’ And after that the insol-
vent raised money from Barnabas and fell in a
third time.
S. Auk tralian Premier Price was apprenticed
at nine years old to his father as stone-cutter.
He came to Australia 22 years ago. Wanted to
select land, but couldn’t. Chopped stone.
Entered the Civil Service and rose. Sacked in ’93
for his political op ;:ions.
Lewis Cohen, M.L.A. (S.A.), is a Hebrew
with a sweet tooth, and chews lollies assiduously
in- the House. When he brings chocolates it
generally means that he is going to wake things
up, but when he merely intends to sit tight and
see the debate out lie lays in butter-scotch.
Nick Willis—our returning land agent —
wasn’t a mean man. He spent money artfully.
Sai ! of him that once he put George Dibbs’ much
involved accounts square for him. And he was
•one of the financial friends behind that mournful
venture, the Sydney Daily Post, which ran, or
t least hobbled, in the Labor interest.
Accused against S.A. Premier Price by
one of the Adelaide papers that at any rate his
necktie wasn’t Australian when he made his policy
speech. But it was—a buff leather necktie, tanned
in Adelaide from an Australian hide. Leather
neckties, by the way, are considered very “ toney ”
for men nowadays.
Australia’s first lady lawyer” recalls Aus-

Guerin, who got the degree of B.A. at Melbourne
University in 1883. Her father was Governor of
Ballarat Gaol. In the earlier days the girl
graduate tended to the blue-stocking type. Now
she is oftener winsome and fluffy.
Died in Adelaide recently Ernest Cour-
tenay Kempe, aged 51 years. He was partner
with Kidman in cattle and horse breeding,
Angora goat raising, and the production of fine

much of our interior waste lands.
MR. JACK WREN, of “ The Tote,”

If Dr. Wollaston retires from his position
as head of the Customs, the man who, in all fair-
ness, should inherit the place is Mr. Lockyer,
of Sydney. The political aspirants for the posi-
tion—men of no experience and with no reason to
advance for their appointment, except that they
may be nasty in the House if not appointed—
should be unanimously rejected.
Ex-Governor Jersey, who has decided to
pay a visit to N.S.W. in November, is to be
treated as a guest of the State d uring his stay, the
arrangement including the free use of Government
House. There is an idea that Jersey has special
facilities for getting on the blind side of Cohen
when a new loan is wanted or an old one falls due,
and N.S.W. has to be specially polite to everybody
whose nose even remotely suggests influence with
Cohen.
A Sydney artist, of some skill too, in
despair the other day sold a big 1 , lot of pictures,
sketches and drawings to a dealer at sixpence

speckled ones too.” Thus does Art come down to
the level of the cauliflower.
Died on Thursday, at Darlinghurst, Eliza-

G. W. Lord was a former Colonial Treasurer, and

Sydney brewery people express delight at
seeing in the London papers the name of R. Luca*
Tooth coupled with that of Queen Alexandra, and
the conjunction is taken as a compliment to Beer.
R. Lucas gave £lO,OOO to an English hospital fund
as thanksgiving for King Edward’s recovery from
appendicitis, and so he deserved to bulk big at the
opening show. Also he deserves to be struck with a
£15,000 absentee-tax, as a hint that his own coun-
try has some-claims on him, even if King Edward
never h>d appendicitis here.
John Meagher’s blood boils because Syd-
ney Freeman’s Journal said any old County
Clare woman on crutches knows more about a cer-

John. John is a native of Kilrush, County Clare,
and to-be'hit there is to be struck in a very sensi-
tive spot. However he smites back with savage
ferocity when he informs the public, through the
Catholic Press, that the editor of the Freeman 8
Journal is an Englishman. Great heavens!
What!
One veteran writes about another :
Deceased C. H. Woolcott filled the billet of Sydney
Town Clerk during thirty years of unparalleled municipal
bungling. Man and boy he was close on half a century m
the employ of aldermen, many of whose names are by-
words. The effort of VVoolc tt’s life was to keep out of
rows, his heroic labors in that direction finally leading to
the row which cost him his billet. He retired with a gift
of £lOOO, the feud between Mr. John Davies and the
Harris family making his position intolerable. Woolcott s
hobby was skimming up and down the Harbor in a trim
little boat, timing himself from point to point. He died
at the age of 81.
The returned globe-trotter, imparting the
•“information” he has acquired on his travels, is
not more unconsciously funny than the daily
newspaper paragraph which treats him as a
matter of public interest. Thanks to its instructive
press, Australia is now in a position to know that
one Mr. White, of the Melbourne Harbor Trust,
has lately visited “England, Scotland, Ireland,
Canada, and America,” with the result that he
thinks “there is no place like home.” On the
subject of weather Mr. White is most illumina-
tive. “ He found that the climate of the Dominion
was dreadfully severe —the .place was under snow
for a great part of the year.” Somebody should
engage White for a lecturing tour —“ How I went
to Canada and found it Cold.”
“ Nym ” re an ancient; —
Old “Dad” Bradshaw, who has just moved his bones to
his son’s farm on the Big Trickle, so as to be ready to
cross the river at Gabriel’s call, made the first successful
incubator used in Victoria. “Dad” was a carpenter at
Williamstown at the time. His wife wanted chickens,
and the broody hens had gone to arbitration over a diffi-
cult and obscure point, so “ Dad” rigged up a concern to
hatch 200 chicks at a sitting. It was exhibited, and
caused much discussion, at the Melbourne Agricultural
Society’s Show of 1871. Since then the old man has spent
his time on the Kyabramapootra fringe, wine and fruit-
growing, with a bit of cockying thrown in to keep the
dingo off the oilcloth in the front passage. But the last
three years were bad ones, for each season the locusts
took the old man’s vineyard and orchard in their stride,
and so he has moved on —aged 84, ready to cross the
river, yet as keen a nature-lover as ever.
Australia comes on top again in the Cold
Country—this time in medicine, Dr. “Phil”
Clarke, formerly of Adelaide University and
Adelaide Children’s Hospital, has secured the
Edinburgh University medal, and scored top place
in the examination in midwifery and the diseases
of women. He obtained 92 per cent., and was run
close by an Irish doctor, who scored 90 per cent.,
and an American who came third. When Clarke
was a lad attending Adelaide Christian Brothers’
College, he fell 20ft. from a balcony and smashed
his head on an asphalt pavement. It looks as if
one Australian with a patched head can more than
hold his own against any sort of head the world
can send to Edinburgh.
A rather notable personage dropped out
last week—Charles Henry Woolcott, who died at
Ivy Cliff, Berry’s Bay, Sydney, aged 84 years.
Mr. Woolcott came to Sydney with his parents in
1832 when under 12 years of age. The father
established himself in the boot trade in Pitt-
street, and the son, when able to paddle his own
canoe, got a clerkship in the new corporation, just
established. John Rae was Sydney’s first town
clerk. Somehow the affairs of the municipality
got into a muddle, the corporation was abolished
and three commissioners appointed, Mr. Rae being
one. When municipal matters were straightened
out in 1857 and George Thornton came in as
mayor, Mr. Woolcott was town clerk, and he con-
tinued so for more years than are easy to count.
He lived for nearly 50 years in the house at Berry’s
Bay and used, in the primitive days, to urge his
own boat across the waters every morning when
he came to business. In those days any eminent
citizen was liable to come to business in it, whale
boat and leave it at the mouth bf the Tank Stream.
“ Robert Hap ” thinks he has lost some
lunatics
Missing ! three of Sydney’s cranks. I have a suspicion
where one of them has gone. He was a young man, who
believed he was walking round the world, and did “ the
Block ” three times a day in a terrible hurry, swinging his
arms like cows’ tails. As he never appeared to get any
further north than the Post-office, and as the southern
side of King-street was to him an unexplored region, the
police, one day, took a hand and ran him to earth as he
was crossing the Pyrenees, near Martin Place.
A pathetic case was that of the gaunt person with iron-
grey hair and half-inch soles to his boots. He was always
expecting a letter from England, and called at the Post-
office every morning. He always received the same
answer, although the clerk seldom bothered to search.
He was known as “ The letter that never came.”
A weird personality stalked about the city under a
Glengarry cap, with the tails starched, and ironed out
straight behind. He was of good family, and had gone
cheerfully into exile after making shocking statements in
the presence of royalty. When last seen, he was making
sotto voce remarks about the quality of the beer, and
“ poking faces ” at the publican.
SOMEWHAT IRRELEVANT, IT WOULD
SEEM.
THE PLAIN STOUT MAN : “ Strong! I just
reckon I run. Whir , do you know, I can
raise 260H. with one hand?”
THE REDUCED GENTLEMAN : “ Bai Jove, look at
that!” (Insinuatingly.) “And I can’t
raise 3d.”
The oldest inhabitant of Bacchus March
(Vie.) has gone over, aged allegedly 103. Mr. James
Densley is said to have been born at New Norfolk
(Tasmania) on April 22,1802, but as Tasmania was
not settled until 1803, there is an error some-
where. Centenarians, as a rule, are unreliable.
“Melb.”: I have just been pleasurably
listening to John West’s illustrated lecture on
“Footsteps of the Explorers,” apropos a celebra-
tion of the anniversary of Burke and Wills leaving
this city. The celebrated Mr. Brahe was there !
The sight of him did indeed make me feel the
force of Byron’s line about certain things touching
the electric chain, with which we’re darkly bound,
and gave me a galvanic thrill. Brahe, it will be
remembered, was in charge of the Cooper’s Creek
depot, and came in for a fearful storm of criticism,
afterwards diverted to Wright, and to Burke for
appointing Wright. West fairly pointed out the
circumstances which tend to Burke’s exoneration,
but here was the man who, 42 years ago, left
Cooper’s Creek on the very day that Burke
arrived. How maddening were all the circum-
stances !
Bishop Frodsham, of North Queensland,
dishing up again, in July Nineteenth Century,
poor old Rev. Richard Johnson, First Fleet chap-
lain, misses the true pathos of the effeminate
parson’s character. He liked ease and comfort and
money, but beyond everything he cherished a
lady’s desire to be treated with respectful con-
sideration. And that is just what he didn’t get,
and what embittered his life and ruined his health.
He preached too long on one occasion, ajid the
free people of his congregation walked out of his
wattle-and-daub structure. “ I looked round and
saw half-a-dozen convicts standing behind me,” he
wrote, “but (such were my feelings) I could not
go on with my discourse, and therefore returned
home greatly distressed in my mind at such
barefaced profanation and infidelity.” “Not
more than ten or twenty convicts,” he wrote
again, “ and sometimes scarcely any except my
own servants, ever attend public service. . . .
Twice they robbed my house—once through the
wall, brick and a half thick, and once through the
tyling—and both times I was robbed of property
to a great amount.” Marsden, who succeeded
Johnson, grew fat on the job. He at least could
get a large and respectful congregation of convicts ;
in his capacity as a magistrate he flogged those
who ignored him or treated him with disrespect
till they gladly went to hear his longest sermons
in hopes of propitiating the strenuous reverend.
Johnson was also a magistrate, but apparently he
never flogged his congregation.
, This is a two-year-old story of an
eminent politician, as told by several others
who are only imminent politicians. The
comparatively great man was conducting
a campaign with a view to persuading
the electors that the salvation of the
country demanded his immediate
elevation to the position and
salary of Premier, and found
himself stranded by stress
of circumstances in a
small township by, the
way, where he was un-
known and unexpected
by the many. To while
away the time, he was
liersuaded to attend a
ocal plain and fancy
dress ball, and he agreed
on receiving an earnest
assurance that he would
not be called upon to be
funny or to do tricks.
The ball was a big suc-
cess in its way, but de-
spite the eminent one’s
studious reticence and
strict sobriety of deport-
ment, the guests seemed
to find him a dist noth
comical object. At mid
night, much to the great
man’s disgust, he found
himself the centre of a.
sort of deputation which
carried a gilt clock under
a glass dome. The M.C.,
acting as spokesman,
said the committee had
much pleasure in award-
ing him the clock, which
everybody in the room
admitted was rightfully
his. The crowd cheered
as the clock was dumped
into the arms of the emi-
nent politician. “But
what is this for?” asked the recipient. “That
is the prize for the best sustained character,”
said the M.C. “Why, what character?”
gasped the great man : “That of Mr. George
Reid, of course.” “Mr. George Reid !” the stout
man cried. “ Why, confound it all, I am Mr.
George Reid ! ” George thinks it was a joke put
up on him, but the imminent politicians swear the
committee acted in all innocence.
Said that the famous Nicholas Willis
netted a big sum by his shipments of horses to
S’Africa for the War Office. His last cargo of
gee-gees was not under contract, and peace inter-
vened. The horse market was glutted and he
stood to lose £lO,OOO. A less enterprising ex-
porter would have sat down and anathematised
his luck. Not so Willis. It is said that he posted
to Pretoria, saw Milner and Kitchener, and got
John Bull’s cheque for every hoof. He found
that “ Imperialism pays.”
“Matrix” writes, showing how a poor
politician may be a good boss: —
Par. (B. 17/7/’O5) commenting on the “M‘Cutcheon
clan,” may give a wrong impression. M'Cutcheon has.
this set-off against his Toryism—that he has always
treated his employees well. He was the first to concede
the eight-hours principle in the Melbourne printing
trade ; and when the working printers had their initial
Bay picnic, eighteen months ago, M'Cutcheon was the
only master printer who purchased a ticket and accom-
panied them.
Curious, by the way, how a man’s qualities as a
boss are taken into account when he puts up for
Parliament, and not his qualities as a worker.
Every morning The Bulletin sees a bootblack,
who puts a most beautiful polish on the toes, and

up to now it has never heard any Fat party stop
to remark that that admirable shoeblack ought to.

won the Melb. Cup afterwards, and who was then tank-
sinking on the station), and Poole (station hand). Lind
and Urquhart were the first to pull out. Next move was to
put the thing into 14 shares ; the holders were W. Jamie-
son and W. C. Dalglish (both surveyors in the Lands Dept.),
K. E. Brodribb (who was Mt. Gipps’ squatting neighbor),
the late Solomon Wiseman, E. Thompson, Bowes Kelly,
Rasp, James, Charley, Poole, Cox, W. R. Wilson, and
M’Culloch. Cox (blacksmith on the station) and Poole
sold out shortly afterwards. Jamieson got in by a fluke
—though, if it comes to that, it was all a fluke. He was
ordered out West, and was nearly throwing up the job ;
but an older hand in the department put it to him that
as most surveyors had to do one turn in the Never Never,
and only one, it was best for a man to go out there while
he was young; so Jamieson went. Dalglish was his
superior officer at the time ; that was how Dalglish got
there, but he died soon afterwards.

CLOCKWORK.
FAIR ANGLO-SAXON: “ And what are you doing
now, my good man?"
MINER: “ I’m winding up the bucket.”
FAIR LADY: “Dear me! And for how long will
it go after it is wound up?"
In a work on “S.A. Aborigines” by the
late Rev. George Taplin, he mentions that the
women generally grow more or less face-hair
after they cease child-bearing, and that they re-
cognise this as a sign that they will have no
more children. And, the author adds, “I think
they are right.”
“Priam”: Your aborigine (B. 10/8/’0o)
must have seen only one faction of his Hindus, to
credit them with an all-round Freemasonry. I
don’t know much about our black British brothers
in N.S.W., but in Victoria they are split into two
camps, and the consequent rows have (within the
last year or two) led to a dozen police court cases,
and the stabbing of one man nearly to death. The
trouble arises out of caste. There is in Melbourne
a rich storekeeper, of caste so low that in India it
would be almost a compliment if a Singh of the
Punjaub were to spit upon him. Here, in Vic-
toria, he has made money, and has got many of
the aristocrats into his debt. Some of them are
satisfied to be his heelers and sycophants ; the rest
make filthy remarks concerning his female rela-
tives. Feeling between the factions runs so high
that whenever they meet, while pursuing their
hawking avocation out-back, shreds of Hindu
skin are left hanging on the fence-wires.

“ Loy Yang” : Re paddymelon-kangaroo
rat controversy. “W.P.8.” is bushed right
enough ;so is “ Janor” ; so am I. There are at
least two distinct animals known as the Too rat—
one in Gippsland, Victoria ; the other anywhere
in the interior of N.S.W. Former is little larger
than the bandicoot, which, in the matter of its
long snout, it resembles; has dark brown fur,
coarse and scanty, especially on the tail. The
latter, common on the Bland and the plains of
West Bogan, is much larger, with soft light-grey
fur and a short nose. When poked out of a log it
emits a harsh, grunting noise, and smells worse
than a butter agent’s reputation ; while the
Southern variety is both silent and odorless. The
head of the “ paddy ” is distinct from all others
of the Too tribe in its gracefulness, being particu-
larly small, with dark marking, and soft, bright
eyes. The distinctive mark of the paddy melon is
the “sign of the cross”—two dark, well-defined
lines, one extending right across the shoulder, and
the other from the tip of the nose to well down
the spine.

“ Jimmie Pan.” : West-o’-Darling folk are
generally of opinion that the West is about to
enjoy a cycle of good seasons, save perhaps in the
N.W. corner. One of the most cheering signs is
the return of wild turkeys in flocks. Lately tur-
keys have been killed within a few miles of Broken
Hill. Up from Wilcannia scores have been
noticed, and over forty were shot this year within
a few miles of Bourke. I saw several flocks back
o’ Bourke. The largest flock, of which there is
authentic record in 1905, numbered 32. The
coming of the wild turkey is always regarded as
a prophecy of good years.

“Bricky” (from Gippsland): This camp-
ing out of nights to cure a cold sickens me. Was
once camped with a fellow by the name of Bill.
Bill was subject to colds, and had tried patent
medicines to no purpose. One cold evening he
was so angry about his snuffles that he said, briefly :
“I’m goin’ ter get drunk.” He didn’t come home
that night, but I thought he was at the pub.
Next morning, I found Bill beside the track. His
cold was quite gone. We buried him the next
day ; and I’ll cheerfully bury the whole nest of
cranks who write about sleeping out on frosty
nights as a cure for colds.

Coolibah Charlie gravely said to Jimmie
Pannikin:—“Crooked Mick, the mail-change

That fixed th’

“ Xerxes ” : Saw recently the outer frame-
work of a magpie’s nest composed entirely of
pieces of fencing wire. Should think there were
fully 50 pieces of wire of various lengths—total
weight at least 51b. Do you think maggie per-
sonally chewed these samples off the fence or
found them lying about loose ?

SIMPSON : “ Look here, por'er, shlike this. One of us ish goin' ’way by nexsht train, ’n’ the
othersh s'reein him off; but we don’ know (hie) which ish which,”
“ Millewa ” : The new method of droving
wild pigs on the Murray (B. 13/7/’O5) may be
good, but the old one was more exciting. We
used, as kiddies, to go out armed with a strong
flour-bag and a dozen or so dogs. The canines
bailed up the porker, and the bag-bearing youth
then advanced in light skirmishing order tilt the
pig charged. Provided he held the bag open with
sufficient determination, the bewildered victim of
circumstances rushed inside, and was promptly
imprisoned f6r future operations. The proceed-
ings were diversified when a novice, alarmed at
the suddenness of the rush, dropped the bag
and took to flight, with the pig two inches in the
rear, saying “ whoof.” But it was great sport,
and spare-rib and potted head are noble institu-
tions to bring the children up on.

“ Pot Jostler ” : Your correspondent “B.”
(B. 22/6/’O5) is slightly astray. Up here in C.
Queensland dugong “bacon ” is considered quite
a luxury, and to such an extent is it sought by
epicures that one publican at Emu Park had a
standing advt. in the local paper: “Dugong
bacon always on hand.” I have tasted dugong
flesh, fresh, cured and smoked, and find it moi e
like oily pork than anything else. The flesh is
streaked like bacon. Dugong are pretty plentiful
on the Mary River, where dugong grass grows in
abundance. The oil, mixed with iguana oil, is
said to be a splendid palliative for rheumatism.
* * * *
“ Nor’-West ” (Gascoyne) writes on the
other side :
R -. all the rot written at various times in The Bulletin
and elsewhere about ill-treated natives, etc. A contented
nigger is reliable and hard-working ; therefore a very
valuable asset to a station. The only way to keep a
nigger contented is to treat him well, and, above all, let
him have his women to himself. Of course a nigger has
not the same moral ideas as a white, and he will lend his
lubra out of sheer friendliness or for pay, but he likes to
be boss. He resents the woman trading on her own.
The men who gas about ill-treatment know no more than
those who say the squatters would like the Government
to take the niggers away. By the present arrangement,
the nigger is of use to the squatter, and he gets good
treatment, and is as happy and contented as he ever was.
I would like you to see a gang of niggers—fat, burly
fellows—at hard graft, laughing and talking, and every
now and again fairly writhing with laughter at some joke.
I wonder if the “ Lady on the Gascoyne,” whose letter
I read a long time back, would mention the station the
man came from whom she writes of? I can say, with
safety, there is no station on the Gascoyne that would
allow a station-hand to take away agin. Men have bribed
gins to run away, but her boys are generally, on the track,
and are backed up by the station, and the man has to
make himself scarce. 1 can’t help thinking the “ Lady on
the Gascoyne ” is some more or less educated waster who,
because he could not get a job, tried to be nasty.
Another lie is that about niggers being used for shear-
ing, then turned into the bush to feed themselves. If a
nigger is good enough to make a shearer, he is too good
to be let go, unless he asks for a “ bush walk.” Then, of
course, it is policy to let him have it.
You will sometimes see (especially where a lot of
niggers are working together) one of the station niggers
come up with a, bush nigger looking very solemn and say,
“He want warkum here.” But niggers would not come
in if the others were not happy. As a last word : The
“cruelty” people forget that a nigger, working and
happy, is worth half a dozen working and waiting to run
away ; and that alone assures the nigger’s good treat-
ment.
# * • *
“War E.” : Be peculiar deaths. I re-
member a strange fate that overtook a carrier,
some years ago, out on the black-soil plains. He
turned out, and, as usual, pitched his bed under
the dray—the out-of-date two-wheeler and pole.
During the night it rained heavily, and, having a
weighty load on, the dray slowly sank. A
day or so later it was found with the carrier
crushed to death underneath. There are awful
possibilities in a death like that. It might be
hideously slow and smothery, with the sludge
rising below and the coffin-lid squashing down
above, and escape only a foot away all the time.
“ W.S.T.” : Frank Farnell, Chairman of
N.S.W. National Park Trust, has been congratu-
lating himself on the fact that in the conservation -
area of the Park deer, wallabies, lyre-birds, and
pigeons are increasing rabidly- This is satisfac-
tory, certainly, but there is room for still greater
care. At the south end of the Park—where the
O’Sullivan, when Works Minister, allowed saw-
millers to intrude, for the sake of a few hundred
pounds—all the birds and beasts have been
destroyed or dispersed. Here, for the first time
for years—before the advent of the wood-choppers
—I found a lyre-bird’s nest, with a half-grown
young one. On the hill side I also found a bower
bird’s play-ground, gaily decorated with pieces of
blue glass, lory’s blue feathers, and freshly-picked
blue flowers—in fact, a study in blue. A hand-
some black satin-bird was in charge, with several
sober-colored wives. It is many years since I last
saw a similar haunt (on the Manning River), and
had anybody told me of a bower-bird’s sanctum
anywhere around Sydney, I would have laughed
him to scorn.
* * * *
“James Dish” : Strufch is stronger than
fiction, and the following is not even remotely
related to fiction. An outback N.S.W. station-
manager stretched himself at full length, face
downwards, to take a drink out of the Warrego.
He was drinking deeply, when a large cod made a
r ish at him and endeavored to bite his countenance
off. The fish marked the man’s nose, cheeks and
chin so terribly that he had to let his beard
grow to hide the scars. Unfortunately the victim
o' the cod’s voracity is not able to grow a beard on
his nose, which shows a marked disfigurement.

“ Paul Cupid ” : Once had a demonstration
of the effects of the demon drink. Wine-making
was in progress. When the fermented skins were
pressed, they were cut out of the press and the
cdws and pigs got at them. After a while, there
was a noise outside as if the bottom of Sheol had
given way and Cain, and Henry VIII., and Caesar
Borgia had fallen into the pig-sty. Old Wetzzler
went out to investigate. The cows were mostly
lying down, roaring, but the bull was in a hilarious
condition of inebriety, and appeared to be trying
to sing. When he saw Wetzzler, he put his head
down and blew his nose. Wetzzler hit him with
a stone, and the animal came after him with
erratic diagonal jumps, until he lost his equilib-
rium. Wetzzler sprang into the pig-sty, where
he was warmly received. The swine were biting
chunks out of each other ; their ears were muti-
lated, and most of them had already lost their
tails. If Wetzzler had worn a tail, he would have
lost it too ;as it was, he lost his coat. Some time
after, I heard a clergyman relate this incident
from the pulpit, and, in order to show that man
in the matter of drink had less sense than a beast,
he said that the animals could not be induced to
touch the fermented grapeskins again. That was
not true, for the two young Wetzzlers and myself
gave them a couple of barrow-loads, one day, when
the old man was away. It had two effects. The
pigs were as drunk as fiddlers in less than an hour,
and the young Wetzzlers had to sleep out for
nearly a week, for the old Prussian parent ran
after them with a whip if he saw them a mile off.
THE OLD BAR PARLOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ho ! bring me a whisky, landlord ; and what will you try
yourself ?
What brand ? Well, you ought to know it. It stands on
the middle shelf,
With the red—but I’m forgetting, and seem to be mixed,
somehow.
“ Drop o’ the best” we called it, but you don’t keep the
same brand now.
And you don’t keep the same old faces. I can see not a
single mate,
Or anything else familiar. Ah, yes ! I can see the slate,
And that was a friend—a good one—and never turned dog
on woe,
Or on us in this Old Bar Parlor, where we drank long
years ago.
Yes, this is the Old Bar Parlor, but everything now seems
strange,
And you have poured out my whisky, and quite forgotten
my change.
In the old days, I remember, we had the run of the
shelves—
The boss might reach down the bottle ; we poured out
the stuff ourselves.
0, that’s all right, I understand, and here is good health
to you,
And here’s a toast to the wild, hot days—the days of ’92 1
There, serve out drinks at my expense to those in the bar
dust-drjq
And I’ll sit here in the parlor, and think of the days gone
by.
Till dawn round the table sitting, dreamer, and slave, and
fool,
Learning the things in a public-house you never learn at
school;
Planning deeds for a dim to-morrow—deeds you will
never do,
Cursing your fate at large and trusting the devil to pull
you through.
One goes out of the door to marry—we never taught him
that:
One—with the drunkard’s luck—plays trumps, and he
waxeth rich and fat.
O :e stays, a battered Bohemian, heedless of gain or loss ;
On; is a rolling stone for aye— and what is the good of
moss ?
W.iat (hie) the matter, landlord? Sleeping (hie)? Me!
No fear?
Ha! there’s a tap at the window—give the bobby his
beer.
Tan the lamp down. Draw the curtain. Bring out the
dice and cards ;
Mine is the same ; and what’s the others’ ? Now let us cut
for pards.
Let us be gay, and sing and play till the beer gets into
the head ;
Then let us skite till broad daylight, and "time to go to
bed;
Or if I’m blind drunk and cannot walk, an 1 it’s after half-
past four,
Put me to sleep on the sofa, for T've often slept there
before.
tAs.

WOLFE’S Schnapps
MEANS BUSINESS WHEN IT TACKLES
YOUR KIDNEY TROUBLES',
Over a century ago Australia made a big
attempt to become its own cloth and linen manu-
facturer. It had the necessary raw material, but
required skilled workmanship. On the matter
being explained, the British Government selected
an English weaver, one Edward Wise, and fitting
him out with weaving and spinning machines,
despatched him as special instructor. Wise was
hard up, and drew £BO, the whole of his first
year’s salary, in advance, and on his way out fell
overboard and was drowned. The enthusiasm for
local manufactures thereupon subsided, and so far
as N.S.W. is concerned it hasn’t wakened up
much since.
“ Scatter your minions ! ” said Disease one day
To the demon Cold and his friend Decay ;
“ Winter is here to give you a hand,
Out 1 friend, out ! and ravage the land.”
“ I can’t ” said the Demon, “ I’m quite out of work,
A mortal named Woods pulls me up with a jerk ;
His Great Peppermint Cure is death to my host.
Good-bye ! ” said the Demon, and gave up the ghost.*

BENNO'S BEANO
BENNO (always the perfect gentleman): Ere , murrer , wot's become of yer manners? You
’aren’t give this cow ’ere a knife , an’ he's fatin' 'is pudden wiv his fingers.
“ Caro,” a city girl, goes to a country
show :
Everyone talked of the show, and my expectations rose
high. 'it had rained for days beforehand, and people
spoke familiarly of mud, and said personal things of mud.
The people alluded to it as inclement. We ventured forth
arrayed in fine raiment. The town of one street and
many public-houses hummed with life, and from down
the river and across the heavy plain crept buggies and
waggonettes, the family nondescript, the unmentionable,
the indescribable, and the what-Is-it. In a light trap that
leaped the ruts we splashed hilariously along, in spite of
the propensity of the near horse to shuffle his hoofs in the
most liquid places. Facetious cookies, complacent com-
mercials, rotund station magnates, their women folk, and
the gaudy “shes” from the many bars littered the
ground with splendor. Not for all the flaring allurements
of the booths would we abandon our seats in the vehicle.
One maiden stood lamenting ankle-deep, in blue gar-
ments, clutching a petticoat that was once white, while
her attendant fished wildly in the bubbling mud for a lost
shoe. An infant in white woolly garments abandoned an
anxious mamma, and chortling at his unexpected chance,
flung himself upon the breast of a heaving bog, and was
with difficulty rescued from his wallowings. A raw-
boned grey in front, flurried by the first notes of the local
band, sat' down, to the general consternation. Eyes
turned hopefully upon the jumps, but when the first
horse stood on his head, the second sat down heavily, the
third slid sideways in an avalanche of mud, and the fourth
(and last) shied at a puddle and deposited his rider in the
slush, the harassed committee closed the event. Then a
trotting exhibition ensued, but the exhibit bogged, and
the trotter pawed viciously at bespattered air, while his
driver made wholly unnecessary remarks about the town.
The merry-go-round shrieked, and the fat woman openly
paraded, and the ground was too sticky for the buck-
jumpers to buck. Damsels wept, and their attendant
swains looked murderous. Then rumor alleged that an
intoxicated person had sunk in the middle of the show
ground, and when he had been rescued it came on to rain
and we urged our steeds to swim home.
**_ * *
“S.R.” : I witnessed an enjoyable finish
to some recent bush races. Bill, who had been
seeing snakes, picked up a real one on the course
—a full carpet-reptile measuring about sft.—and
waving the wriggling serpent round his head like
a coil of heavy rope, raced in pursuit of the
departing carts and buckboards. The several
Dads blasphemed at sight of the fiendish one, and
belted the horses into a gallop, and amidst dust
and screams from the terrified Mary Janes and
Lizzies, raced down the road with William hang-
ing closely to the wheels and whacking the reptile
in(o the laps of those seated behind. Finally the
carpet fastened its teeth in the leaf of a girl’s hat
and took possession of it. Then Bill yelled and
swung the snake, with the hat in its mouth,
round his head, and whacked everybody; and
as the procession rushed along in a dust-cloud,
with more dust behind, and pandemonium and
carts and shrieks in front, and Bill below, and the
snake and the hat above, it was a fearsome show.
Bill chased the carts till the occupants sought
safety in a small wayside pub. They rushed the
dining room and locked the door, and with
Publican and Mrs. Publican and the Chinaman
cook added to their number, sat round the table
with beer before them. “We’re pretty safe here
from the mad ! ” the publican had just begun
to say, when the carpet snake and the hat were
heaved over the partition on top of the beer. And
the yells and the bashing and the falling of
furniture were memorable.
* * * *
“Quo Vadis”: The high conical ants’
nest that is built of mud makes splendid floors
when broken up small and mixed well with water.
It sets hard like cement. Needing some to make
a floor, I harnessed two horses to the dray, and,
after taking about 10 minutes to explain to the
blackfellow that I required a dray-load of ants’
nests, sent him out. He could get a dray-load
anywhere within half-a-mile of the place, but
apparently he wandered far for he only returned
at sunset—with an empty dray and two very tired
horses, and the knees worn out of his trousers.
Going out to investigate I was met with a very
large grin on a very exhausted nigger—and a jam
tin with 10 or 12 ants in it. The aboriginal is a
person upon whom explanation is often wasted.
“ Ses.” : People who had forgotten about
the bush fires that swept Albury (N.S.W.) dis-
trict about the beginning of the year, were re-
minded of them the other day, when the police
presented their report as to the causes of 36 of the
outbreaks. It is presumed they have been going
over the country with a spy-glass and a rake
during the interval. Phosphorus—which is laid
to poison rabbits, but doesn’t poison them worth a
cent, while it is rapidly exterminating our valuable
insectivorous birds—is credited with 12 disasters ;
wax matches (probably dropped accidentally), 2;
sun’s rays through glass, 1 ; persons wilfully
setting fire to grass, 3; careless use of fire, 3;
machinery bearings becoming heated, 1; lightning,
1; sparks from railway engines, 2. In the other
cases the causes were not ascertainable. To
a smart officer who can track up a wax match,
probably dropped accidentally, and consumed in
the conflagration seven months ago, any cause at
all should have been ascertainable.

The St. George (Queensland) rabbit in-
spector reports about bunny in his district
Along 160 miles of border fence forming the boun-
dary line between N.S.W. and Queensland fully 100 miles
of the N.S.W. side is a howling-wilderness. Not a blade
of grass is to be seen. For nearly the whole distance on
the Queensland side the country is stocked, yet looks like
a lucerne paddock. On the N.S.W. side (unstocked) it is
a barren waste, and thousands of rabbits are making
determined efforts to squeeze through the wire netting.
There must be great mortality amongst them this coming
summer. The border fence is a valuable investment.
But, valuable as the fence may .be, it is only of
temporary benefit. Bunny will swarm on the
northern side some day, and though this genera-
tion gets all the benefit, it leaves posterity—rabbit-
infested posterity—to pay for the fence. The
blessed thing is regarded officially as a permanent
and reproductive fence to keep out a permanent
and reproductive rabbit.

“Werrimee”: In Bulletin of 17/8/’O5
“Nulla” says :
“Werrimee” (B. 13/7/’O5), after settling the paddy-
melon-kangaroo-rat difficulty, himself confounds the
rat-’roo with the quite distinct jerboa. There are four or
five kinds of rat-’roo, some found all over Australia, but
the jerboa (Podanomalus Mitchelli) is known principally
in W. and South Australia. Further, the rat-’roos are
larger than any of the jerboas, except the hairy jerboa
of N. Australia, and are more akin to the kangaroo, as
the jerboa is to the rat.
It is “Nulla” who is confounding things. (1) He
confounds the jerboa-’roos with the jerboa-rats.
The habitat of the jerboas is Arabia, Egypt,
Algeria, S. E. Europe and Central Asia j the Aus-
tralian animals are jerboa-kangaroos and jerboa-
rats. (2) There are 18 or 20 jerboa-’roos (popularly
known as rat-’roos, bettongs, potoroos, etc.); and
the jerboa-rats are a numerous body. That men-
tioned by “ Nulla ” is one of the smallest of the
species, and is known as Mitchell’s rat. It is
plentiful along the Murray River. Different
species are found nearly all over Australia. They
are particularly abundant in North Queensland.
(3) Jerboa-’roos, on the whole, are much larger
than jerboa-rats; but some of the latter would
make a dozen of some of the former. Size is
no criterion. These animals are the only members
of the kangaroo tribe that have canine teeth.
* * * *
“Nym”: A wallaby-tracker passed through
Codville to-day with the best thatch we ever
gazed upon between drinks. He told us that he
had worn no hat since that record dust-whirl at
Cooparoo in 1901, which took his billy cock—cork-
bobs and all—to Kingdom Come. He is never
going to wear a hat till his lost treasure blows back
again. This policy is worthy of emulation by all
bald men, from The Bulletin staff upwards, for
the pomad looked like an animated grass-tree
palm. He added that a five-pound note—his last
bean in the world—vanished in the lining of his
hat in 1901, and we sympathised financially at Is.
apiece.
“The Prooshan ” :
If the local youth culti-
vated as keen a power
of observation for all
things as he does for
horseflesh, he would be
an unusual youth. I once
l-ode a dozen miles with
a lad of 15, and met a
broken-winded bullock -
puncher, who inquired if
we’d seen any horses
along the road. I an-
swered in the negative,
but the boy thought
otherwise. “ Yarns, lie
said, “ back of old Frank-
lin's.” “ How many did
yer s— —ee ? flee a
rn are?” (Pronounce
the end of the word after
a gasp.) “ Yares ; I see
a " valler mare with a
chesnit foal just branded
‘D ’arf circle.' There
was a black ’orse there
too, a bit galled, and a
little, brown, sore-backed
mare runnin’ with a
roachy-backed, bumble-,
footed, old tug, with his
lip ’angin’ down about a
foot; and a sorter blue
roan filly with a worl
eye.” The bullocky looked
mucli relieved. ‘‘ Thought
they muster made back
that w ay,” he wheez-
ed, as he rode off.

“ Y.A.” : Be droving
on a bike. Most drovers
nowadays carry a bike
with the camping outfit
for the purpose of going
ahead to give notice at a
homestead before going on the run. Saves a horse
and is faster. Also useful for looking out for a
likely camping-place.
* » * *
“ Vigilans ” : The finest niggers I have
ever seen are those south of Wave Hill station,
Northern Territory. They practically live m the
desert and subsist on wild fruits. They are huge,
standing over (ift., women are rarely under oft.
!)in. They are of a brown hue, with fine features
—no flat nose business here. They examine you
minutely, taking a hair from your head and com-
paring it with their own ; feel you all over, and
laugh considerably. When we got off our horses
they roared. They were large children seeing
their first circus.
PURSUING A PRIMARY INDUSTRY,
“Be quiet, Bill. I'll have a bite in a minute.”
“Kulpara ” ; Passing a farm, t’other day,
saw the mother and four kids chasing a hen, little
Johnny bringing up the rear with a pepper-pot.
Presently the mother grabbed the hen, and hold-
ing her by the tail sprinkled her backblocks freely
with pepper. She then put chookey down and
that ill-used bird at once made for her nest in an
adjacent bit of scrub, the pursuers doing a sprint
behind her. On reaching the scrub, Willie
crawled in and found the nest with eight eggs. It
is said that the pepper thus used, when a hen cackles
just after laying in parts unknown, makes her
think another egg is imminent, and causes her to
scoot immediately for the nest. It is a shameful
deception to work off on any fowl.
ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MS. No liability is under-
taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent, by post or handed in; and no MS. will be
returned unless stamps (of any State) accompany.
R. A. : “ Esther ” declined. Kindly put name
and address on contributions Congevoi: You are quite
unlike the other bard who wrote of Tamarama 8ay....
Mulga B.: The local butcher spat on the floor at the Hos-
pital Ball. Five pages. It would be cheaper for us to buy
the butcher a spittoon J.J.W. : Your Murphy isn’t a
sufficiently attractive Murphy for one yarn, let alone a
series.... Leprosy : Not in the B.’s line—Lol S. : Don’t
report Junker’s conversation till he tells you something
more thrilling than that. And then tell your own yarn ;
this-disposition to make Junker, or Brown, or Old Bill tell
the yarn is getting too common S.A.: “As I leisurely
absorbed the succulent repast, I observed the various
patrons gathered round the festive board.” In short, you
were eating a pie at a stall, and watching the crowd.
Then why rob your stuff of every hope by the other
hifalutin ?... .Wattle B.: You don’t make any point clear.
....Vulcan: Don’t quite reach second-class Vica :
Moderate merit 0n1y... .Arch L.: Conventionally conceived
and treated... .Coi Mavne : A crude effort... .Oliver :No
literary value in any of them Akarana : Not quite up.
.. . .Annie (I. : “ Punctuation ” rather good idea ; faulty
in detail... .White F.: Too clumsy and ill written A. 8.:
Useless.... H.D. : Rather silly... .J.K.S. : Mildly merito-
rious. .. .T.S. (().): Workmanship too rough... .Cam Treb :
They don’t quite carry interest enough... .Lashmar : Yes,
certainly, try again ; and don’t be so enigmatical
Jeeaich : “ Benefits of Civilisation ”is good verse, but we
don’t want to spread the delusion about the “ noble” savage.
Generally, the savage has all the vices of civilisation which
he has been able to invent, and few of its virtues
M.F. : Your invitation (in two verses) to “Faked
Woman ” to take off her teeth and go about in her naked
mouth is too strong Lex : The unfortunate gentle-
man is deranged. Why jest With the airy lightness of
a locomotive over the delusions of a man who did good
work before misfortune struck him?....N. : “When the
Fish Bite” appeals only to a limited class... .R.A. :
“Parting of the Ways” has some good lines, but is very
indefinite as a wh01e....H. : “Pearls” and “Rose”
hardly get there... .K.K. : Mother-in-law joke is dead....
M.B.E. : Your poem says the “Hour is Come.” Well,
■the poem is gone.... W.H.D. : Sorry to say we have no
use for verses that have been already published in another
paper... .O.M. : Pretty verse, but nothing very strong or
novel in it—not even the “fragrance in the air.”
Unus : “Mother” is a most bathetic thing... .Bowen :
“Swelldom,” etc., is a rather dreary record... .W.S.P. :
One of life’s minor curses is the man who sends a sketch in
one packet and stamps for return in another. That kind
of man never mentions in his letter what the sketch was
called. Why not put name, address, and stamps on
back of sketch ? Larry : Send it to the girl yourself.
(P.S. —On second thoughts, if you love her, don’t send it
to the girl)....ltaki P. : Vigorous, but crude... .Fervid :
“Fair Luna howl worship thee’’—then Luna set in the
w.p.b.... Wat Hoe : “ Seasons” not up... .Vatu : Neither
prose nor verse of much account... .R.V. : Tom Mann
d alogue item quite unusable L. Yang': Statement
that all pigs’ tails curl the same way-duly noted....
Andy: Rather feebly presented... .Lance B. : Both quite
off our track A.M. (<).) : Don’t like treatment....
Clem de L. : Sorry neither is up. Will inquire about the
other matter.. ..G. Wicking : Not terse or vivid enough.
W.T.W. : Vulg-ar and trivial Salva : Not im-
personal enough... .H.T. (Vic.): Callow sentimentalities
in sickly verse... ,C. J. : “ Australia” is wooll.y and plati-
tudinous:.. .Mara: Mere verbal —not intellectual—pro-
fundity Steele G. : “Riding Over Sticks” is a
g'rotesque joke... .Mack :So far as we can gather from
your letter, then, all the talk about shoddy is an inven-
tion, and as shoddy mills do exist (you can find them
mentionedas a matter of course in British official statistics)
their product must be sold as shoddy—for the trader
wouldn’t deceive. Yet where do you see goods marked
“shoddy” or anything like that?... .Gerald B. : Al.
mediocre, thougli “ Dying Hour” embodies a good ideal
....H.J.L. : Your sneer is pointless; because, when a
man who knows writes as if he doesn’t know, he must
expect to be corrected.. . .Jimmy Pick : Point too trifling
for discussion... .Noosa : Intolerably long-winded....
Norman: Rather crudely-conceived Flotsam: Benefit
of First Offenders Act, accordingly Bush-girl: Neither
is quite up to the mark, but you have a refreshingly sim-
ple and direct style, and will probably yet do good work.
Sassafras: irrelevant and incoherent... .T.P.C. :
Grandiloquent futilities. Make sure that you’ve some-
thing to say before you begin to write....D. Mac.:
Has a jarring conventional twang all through it
C.K.A. : One good idea. “But the yearning for love
breeds the love for yearning'.” Generally harsh and
unmusical.... W. P. B. : A poor batch this time....A.B.
(Pretoria): We have already printed most of those facts
as to Chinese slavery in the Transvaal.. ..The Waster:
Can’t trace that poem... .M.F. H. : “White Butterfly”
shows a good deal of promise, but not up to publication
mark... .Maurice S. : The Melbourne claim is usually
allowed to be correct... .R.J.E. : The Coast Seamen’s
Journal is the only one we know, price (we believe) five
cents per copy.... J.O.D. : The Trade Marks Bill, if it
passes, will effect what you propose by giving people an
opportunity of knowing what are Australian-made goods.
....Aries: You are a calamitous speller... .L.L.: Your
imagination is bankrupt.... .Unsuitable : D.B.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
E.J. : Very medium picture of a high-heeled woman
and a small boj'... .I.G. : “111, worse, dead” joke old,
and sketch impossible... .Bill Bailey : There is talent in
them, but not enough talent —or else not nearly enough
experience.... J. Hartwell: Hardly The Bulletin style...
H.C.H.: Three pictures, all'badly out of drawing
F.G. : Drunk and lamp post joke travels on rather well-
worn lines Unsuitable: M.B.


• Every time I take hold of the hand of » f
m developing its resources, I f eei
‘hat I have the grip of *

N.S.W. LANDS COMMISSION ITEM.
Charles Bath said he had no knowledge of the land laws. Such knowledge
was not necessary for .his work as a land
agent. In fact, Charles said he was quite
stripped of information on the subject.
Two witnesses in the Willis,
case are missing, and there are.
, a great many theories as to, |
i where they are stowed away, The, 7.
Bulletin suggests that the police '/
' have them in this sort of.custody.. /
The Jap’s notion of an
indemnity.
N.S.W. keeps an expensive corn*
mercial agent in South Africa, and
he informs us, by way of earning
his wages, that he has “ had several
inquiries for ’possum skins and
rugs.”
King Billy got as far as that
•ong ago.
The N.S.W. Lands
Commission is now
sitting in the Lands
Office, and the statues
outside are wakened
up by the smell.

over all might be well.

POINTS
After all we have some emblems left for a
national flag, even if the kangaroo has been appro-
priated, and the emu has been prigged. N.S.W.
can flaunt the Golden Fleece and the Improve-
ment Lease.
The introduction of the fortnightly-pay
system in the Vic. railway service is a sad blow to
those money-lenders who have been preying on
the impecunious employees every latter half of
the month, for years past.
S. Australia Labor party has now £9OOO
in hand towards establishing a Labor daily, and
reckons that only £6OOO more is necessary. But
under present circumstances the paper is hardly
necessary. The Advertiser backs up the Labor
Earty as strongly as any reasonably conducted
labor paper could.
The white sugar bonus provisions are to be
extended for another five years ; and probably will
then be further extended if there is by that time
enough black labor left in the Commonwealth to
make the step worth while. Sugar planters may
rest assured that this country will not go back on
the White Australia policy.
S.A. Labor member W. D. Ponder
painted a beautiful word picture at Kaptmda
recently. He said that, 40 years ago, he had seen
barrels of beer placed in front of a local hotel from
which all might drink free of cost. He had seen
beer running in the gutter, and he had known all
the dogs in the town to be tight at the one time.
The usual wail comes to hand —from
Maori land this time. Commissioner Dunne,
giving evidence before the Police Inquiry Com-
mission at Wellington, said : “ The returned
troopers enlisted in the force have been very un-
satisfactory.” * They Seem to have been pretty
unsati f mtory in every capacity except as gaoi-
b’rds.
Tasmania has now 126 acres under crop
for every 100 inhabitant: , wV’e 45 years ago it
had no less than 174 acres per. 100 inhabitants.
Also the whole area under crop is 32,000 acres less
than it was six years ago. Unless Tasmania finds
land for its people by breaking up such mono-
polies as that of the V.D.L. Co. it seems a poor
look out for the “ great primary industries.”
Mitchell, M.P., told the S.A. Assembly
the other day that the explanation of the large
number of certificated Chinese engine-drivers in
the State—there are over 80 of them —is that the
officials who issue the licenses get no fees from
candidates who fail. He says the examination
formula is, “ How you start’em ? How you stop
'em? All right. One guinea.'’
S. Australian Parliament has passed a Bill
prohibiting permanent appointments to the Bench
being made in recess. The object is to give the
House the control of the Ministry at the time
when a selection is made. The late Jenkins
Government gave three of its members and its
Whip lucrative offices in the course of one short
year, and three of those billets were filled within
one week. Parliament wasn't sitting then, so the
Assembly found its Jenkins as inaccessible as if
he had been an overhanging precipice.
Tlxe other day Vic. M.L.A. M‘Cutcheon
asked Premier Bent if “he would agree to the
appointment of a joint committee of the two
Houses to examine Federal Bills, in order that
State rights may be defended.” Bent cheerfully
replied that he had acquired an idea of that sort
himself, and would consider the proposal. It is a
silly bit of parochialism. Any attempt by a
State Legislature to interfere with the Federal
Parliament should be promptly resented. The
Senate and the High Court are the specially
constituted guardians of State rights.
S.M. Herald had a nice, grandmotherly
leader last week on “ The Tribulations of a Labor
Party.” It said it knew all along that when a
Labor party got into power it would go to pieces,
and the pieces would fight among themselves.
Then it mentioned that that was just what had
happened, Premier Daglish having “realised his
predicament and retired in favor of his Labor
rival, Mr. Rason.” It almost seems a pity to
spoil the dear old thing’s belief in its own infalli-
bility, by pointing out that Mr. Rason isn’t and
never has been a Laborite —that, in fact, he was
Treasurer in the Ministry that the Laborites
threw out.
The Deakin Government has wisely given
the requisite two years’ notice to discontinue the
Orient mail service. The Orient service is slow
and unsatisfactory; the company is poor and
doesn't seem likely to improve; and after the
squeeze it perpetrated at last renewal of the con-
tract, and the methods by which it tried to be a -
nasty as possible on that occasion, Australia can \
be rid of it too soon. Compared to the record -
that the Union S.S. Co. of Maori land puts up, the
Orient service is a dismal sample of British enter-
prise.
The latest attitude on the Federal capital
question. Joey Carruthers of N. S. W. asked
Prime Minister Deakin if he would agree to
certain questions he enumerated being referred to
the High Court. Deakin replied that if Carru
thers would take these questions to the High
Court as plaintiff he would gladly be there as
defendant. Then Carruthers' hangoivon, Wilks,
accused Deakin of “going down-on his knees” to
Carruthers, and Joey described Deakin’s straight
and definite answer as “a gross attempt to evade
the question.”
Politics are growing very bitter in Maori-
land. A few weeks ago a furious Opposition party
rushed at the Government entrenchments with a
frantic denunciation about an alleged unauthorised
payment to Captain Seddon, son of the Premier,
and then when it had another long look at the
voucher it found that the signature was “Sneddon”
and the payment was made to quite another
man. After that it took the Opposition a little
time to get its second wind, but finally it came up
panting considerably, and said that there really
was a surreptitious sort of payment of £76 to
Captain Seddon, though it wasn’t the payment
originally suspected, and alleged that it had
written statements from three civil servants to
prove it. Then the Auditor-General went through
the accounts and reported blankly that this yarn
was also a lie, and the Opposition is again
breathing heavily behind a tree and preparing
new accusations.
Premier Bent lately told a depu-
tation, which the Melbourne Bookbind-
ers’ Society sent in protest against the
employment of prisoners, that he in-
tended to appoint a Royal Commission
to inquire into the better utilisation of
prison labor, and try to get some more
work out of prisoners instead of less.
If Bent keeps his word he will do a
useful work. There is no atom of sense
in taxing the free man to maintain the
prisoner and his keepers. Persons in
gaol could easily be made to pay all
the cost of their keep and something
towards the support of warders, police,
&c., and they might even be made to
defray the whole bill. As for taking
the work from the free man and giving
it to the prisoner, there is enough work
for all if the country would only do its
own work and import less.
A mildly interesting feature of
the Tory-press crusade against the
trades union label is that these great
organs of public opinion tacitly admit
that once the public has the oppor-
tunity of discriminating between goods
made by union and non-union labor, it
will mostly choose the union-made
article. Considering that all along these
papers have been arguing that the bulk
of the people are opposed to unionism
in all its phases, it is a wonder they
didn’t hail the advent of the label with
much joy, and assure the uniops that
the label would give a hostile public
the opportunity of showing them what it thought
of them.
“ YVal. D.” : I was travelling on the
Glenelg (S.A.) Railway a few days ago, and in
same compartment sat a very churchy- parson.
He was in earnest conversation with a person
sitting opposite, and the whole trend of his
remarks was in protest against the assumption of
office by Tom Price. “Fancy !” this man of the
long coat bleated : “A stonemason at the head of
affairs, good gracious ! ! a stonemason.” Then a
small man in the corner said something about a
carpenter that used to live in Galilee, and a cold
wind blew through the compartment, and the
thermometer dropped like an anchor.
This preference to unionists appeals to
shipping co. ’s as a particularly sinful thing ; the
bluff sea-dog (who is a sea-dog because he owns a
parcel of scrip in a shipping concern) says he
believes in freedom and liberty, he does. And
yet, the other day, when the Orient Co. fixed up
an agreement with Queensland regarding butter
carriage, it saw so much virtue in preference to
unionists that it cordially agreed to recognise it.
Also the butter-shippers insisted on preference to
unionists ; anybody who hasn’t joined their union,
and agreed to do certain things, can’t be certain
of having his grease carried at all, and when it is,
carried he will have to pay id. per lb. more for being
a non unionist. What in the man wholoads butter
is rank blasphemy, and interference:, with the
sacred liberty of the subject, and columns besides,
is mere ordinary business foresight in the man
who owns either the butter or the ship.
“ One Who Knows ” writes :
lie letter (B. 17/8/’O5), the particular Vic. Mallee map the
writer quotes from was issued in the days when the Mallee
was a wilderness, and huge areas were granted under
grazing leases. Neither McPherson, McEdward, nor Carter
hold an acre in the Mallee at the present day ; I think
they are dead long since, and the land they held years
ago reverted to the Crown through the leases falling in,
or through abandonment by lessees. The State has
several millions of acres available for application. Lascelles
had to transfer to eligible applicants in small areas most
of the land that was left him after the Government got a
huge whack from expiring leases. As to “ settlement in
the Mallee perishing almost before it began,” this is sheer
bosh, as the only really legally restricted ownership of
land to be found in Australia is in the Mallee Land Acts.
A man can select 640 acres of first-class Mallee (i.e., worth
£1 per acre), and can obtain by transfer two additional
sections of similar area (little enough in the Mallee), and
for any evasion exceptionally heavy penalties, such as
forfeiture and heavy fines in addition, are provided.
Even mortgagees are forced to get rid of the land they
foreclose on to eligible tenants.
SOLITUDE.
“ Let’s call on Mrs. Fizgig. It's her day at
home."
“Ah, don't! Let the poor thing have one day
all by herself.”
According to Victorian Director of Educa-
tion Tate, “what took Britain into the Transvaal
was simply that it (the Transvaal) was not being
ruled according to modern ideas.” If modern ideas
consist of Chinese slavery this is quite true ; other-
wise it is a lie. But if Britain is really the noble
philanthropist that Tate alleges it should assuredly
send its army to Russia, which is much further
behind modern ideas than the Transvaal was.
Does Britain only worry about modern ideas when
the other country is small and worth robbing ?
A good step is that taken by Mr. Gerald
Campbell, of Sydney, to form a National Defence
League, on the basis of the British National Ser-
vice League, to promote interest in defence ques-
tions and to advocate the Swiss system of universal
citizen service—so long preached by The
Bulletin. Provided that the League does not
drift into the hands of a coterie, but maintains its
original idea of being a non-party and representa-
tive organisation, it should do good national ser-
vice. Address of the League secretary is 29 Den-
man Chambers, Phillip-street, Sydney.
As is only to be expected, in
the absence of a stiff progressive land-
tax, as fast as Premier Bent cuts up
large estates into small holdings, the
greedy land monopolist acquires other
small blocks, mostly per mortgage,
and turns them into vast runs that
block settlement and progress, and
everything that Bent is supposed to
be striving for. Donald Melville, of
Victoria’s House of Rich Landlords,
lately stated that more than half the
Mallee is now in the hands of a very
few people, in spite of the section in
the Land Act which prohibit!; any
person holding more than 1920 acres
of first-class land, 3000 acres of
second-class, 3840 acres of third-class,
or 4800 acres of fourth-class. The
sooner the Federal Labor party forces
on the progressive land-tax the better
—there is little hope of it from t,.e
State Parliaments.
A Brisbane crowd is busy try-
ing to fix another £62,000 of deben-
tures on the city, which already
carries a debt of about £5 per head.
When it couldn’t ask Cohen for any-
more loans in an open way, the Bris-
bane Council silently drifted into
a huge overdraft; and now it wants
to change the overdraft into a per-
manent debt, so that it may drift
into more overdraft. Queensland is
pretty solid on the no-more-borrow-
ing question; but the yarn about
turning a per cent, overdraft int >
debentures that only cost 4 per cent.
is plausible. And the alternative of Liereasing the
rates, and wiping out the temporary debt, and
reducing the interest from 5£ per cent, to nothing
at all, isn’t put forward with as much vigor as it
deserves to be.
From S.M. Herald’s “On the Land”
column :
Apparently, the Governments of the past were imbued
with an idea that their only duty, so far as the port was
concerned, was to provide the easiest possible means for
the admission of the products of other c ountries. Our
own industries were important enough to talk about, but
not of sufficient consequence to call for proper provision
for their transport to markets outside the State.
And the Freetrade party has the same idea to-day.
The Ghost of the Past is an awkward
spectre. In the Senate, the other night, Senator
De Largie asked Government representative
Senator Keating a question. In reply Senator
Keating stated that it was a fact that the Hobart
Postal Conference of 1895 had agreed to a motion
by Mr. Joseph Cook (N.S.W.), seconded by Mr.
J. G. Ward (M.L.), to make it a condition in
future mail contracts that subsidised steamers
should be manned by white labor only ; also that
the said Joseph Cook was then Postmaster-
General in G. H. Reid’s Ministry. Then the
Senate went on with its business, and the Ghost
stalked down to the House of Representatives and
leered derisively across the table at G. 11. Reid’s
deputy, Joseph Cook, who has been lately
denouncing the “ white labor ” clauses in
the Federal Postal Act as “ridiculous,” “tyran-
nical,” and so forth.
“Millewa”: I was
struck, lately, while study-
ing our early institutions, at
the peculiar development of
the civil organisations of Vic-
toria. The first judicial offi-
cial (chosen at a meeting of
the colonists in 1836) was an
arbitrator, to whose deci-
sion all bound themselves to
conform without appeal.
Unfortunately, some person
of the Bruce Smith-M'Lean
type contrived to persuade the
same meeting to also requisi-
tion Sydney for a P.M., who
was supplied, and on his advent
the arbitrator suddenly and in-
explicably disappears from the
y records. A constable, however,
began to draw pay forthwith,
and appeals commenced, and
Gentleman One came on the scene,
and Port Phillip acquired great im-
portance and chest measurement
shortly, after as a place of gaol de-
livery. Then came hangings, and an
Upper House, and the Boon?, and
Irvine.
Yic. Closer Settlement Board
offered 20 farms at Kiewa to the
alleged yearning multitude of would-
be settlers, but only seven were ap-
plied for. The reason gi ven for this
dearth of applicants is a refreshing
novelty. As a rule the Australian
excuses the vacant appearance of
his great country on the ground
that it needs an irrigation scheme.
In the Kiewa case the excuse is too
much irrigation. The blocks with
frontages to the river were lately under
water, and the idea of turning such Hoods
to agricultural account has not yet occurred
to the local inhabitants.
According to Mayor Taylor, as many
as 20 persons may be found living in a single room
in some of Sydney’s slums. He counted that
number in a room in Wexford-street one visiting
night. And the owner who allows these horrors
is to get 10 per cent, over the value of his
property for disturbance. What’s the matter
with giving him ten years ?
Last Monday Sydney Evening News pub-
lished a leading article entitled “Why Japan’s
Credit is so Good,” and gave this as one great
reason :
In Japan all Government undertakings pay, and pay
well. The postal service pays ; so do the telegraphs,
telephones, and railways.. . . Her productive enterprises
are not mortgaged to foreign bondholders ; her harbors,
railways, waterworks, electrical works, telegraphs, tele-.
phones, steamships, factories, mails, are wholly her own,
and paid for with her own money.
Just a year ago, N.S.W. had a State elec-
tion, and a great effort was made by certain
persons and papers to establish a party that would
insist on running N.S.W. on exactly these same
self-dependent principles, and getting rid of the
foreign loan ourse. The News didn’t assist that
movement: instead, it threw at it a silly scoff and
a puerile denunciation. What is the good of the
News admiring honesty and self-reliance in the
public finance of Japan when it aims mud at those
who try to introduce the same honesty and self-
reliance in the public finance of N.S.W. ?
THINGS WILL GAPPEN.
The Women’s National League protests against the
Union Label.
THE LABEL: “ Bli’me! I've trod on thereat!”
One suggestion of the Foreign-trade party
in the Harvester dispute—presumably put forward
to cause delay —is that Australia should “appoint
special officers in foreign countries to ascertain
the domestic values of foreign machinery,” etc.
But why should Australia study the blessed
foreigner at all? A simplievand efficacious plan
is to ascertain the Australian retail selling price
of foreign goods, and value them for duty pur-
poses at, say, 75 per cent, of the retail price. That
would assume that the foreigner was making
£33 Gs. Bd. per cent., and we have no right to
assume that he is such a shark as to take more
than that.

Premier Morgan of Queensland was reared
in an anti-Tory atmosphere. His father, who
founded the Warwick Argus, stubbornly fought
the squatting influence, which tried to preserve
the rich Darling Downs as a sheep and cattle walk.
Jfe kept up the battle with such energy that one
of the Gregorys, brother of Augustus the ex-
plorer, dragged him to the law courts for libel.
The costs might have ruined him had not the
■public enthusiastically paid them by subscription.
Warwick Argus is now run by a Morgan of the
third generation, son of the Premier, and grandson
of the old democratic warrior who argued the
point with Augustus and his angry relative.

“SUNSHINE” ON THE FISCAL QUESTION.
A Little Sermon to the Farmer “Dowd for the Show."


Bulletin remarked in its last issue, deal-
ing with the Lands Inquiry,'that the kernel of
the whole matter is: What became of the huge
fees paid to agents? Now Senator Millen
sends in a reminder that he presented his
books to the Commission to show how his
fees went, and that, after examining those books,
Justice Owen expressed himself as “perfectly
satisfied.’’ It is only fair to Senator Millen to
state that this was so, and that the one big fee
(£1000) which he bagged was huge in amount
rather than in rate, as it represented a great deal
of work spread over three years.
The frolicsome Bent seems to be suffering
a gradual recovery. He grows more democratic
in the process. Someone —or many—of the
multitude of busy bees who gather the honey of
wisdom from D.C.L. whisky must have whispered
the magic letters in Thomas B.’s ear. Even the
sound of the letters D.C.L. has an influence in
the direction of reasonable behavior ; but when
the liquid itself is applied to the proper spot the
most misguided politician becomes relatively
wise.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
A good meny Melbourne people have been smil-
ing at the published reports of how a deputation of par-
sons and others, headed by Archbishop Clarke, waited
upon the Vic. Chief Secretary, last week, to urge the
local suppression of all bookmakers, totes, art-unions, and
every other inducement to the “ Gambling’ Evil.” Intro-
duced by Beazley, M.L. A., who is known to the sinful
world as a personal friend of Jack Wren, the “tote”
autocrat, the shepherds instanced the Collingwood tote
as a particular evil, and Chief Sec. Gillott heard them
without once winking his eye at Beazley. When they
had enthusiastically cursed the tote, and touched inci-
dentally upon the more ancient evil of bookmaking, Gil-
lott informed the holy innocents that he “viewed with
alarm the prevalence of gambling, and had never had any
sympathy with it in any shape or form.” Whereat
Beazley forebore winking at the Chief Secretary. Yet
only a year or two ago L. Mayor Gillott pres.ded at a
deplorable banquet, given to his old friend and partner
(in city property purchases), the notorious Joe
Thompson, formerly the Australian “ King- of the
Ring,” and now a bookmaker in England. Thompson
has never had but the one capacity. He lives by the
“ Evil,” and as a bookmaker re-visiting' the scenes of his
gambles he was praised and toasted by L. Mayor Gillott.
The fact that the initiated public refuse to take seriously
the presence of Beazley, M.L.A., or the remarks of
Minister Gillott, on this occasion does not necessarily
argue an inevitable failure of the Anti-Gambling Crusade.
But seeing that a “ test ” prosecution of a gambling
agency was promised to the anxious shepherds it is only
natural that the intended legal proceedings should be
viewed with suspicion. As to the bookmakers and the
pernicious tote-shops, Gillott’s promises were very vague,
but concerning Tatt.’s Sweep business —which is the re-
spectable rival (not to say deadly enemy) of bookies and
tote-keepers—the Chief Sec. spoke with great earnest-
ness. The Victorian agencies for Tattersall are to
be suppressed if possible. Now, if this is to be
the only result of the Crusade, it will mean an
increase of income for Ikey Moses and Jack Wren.
The money hitherto sent through local agencies, to the
occasional Tasmanian lotteries, will be mostly spent in
backing horses straight out, which is the particular form
of gambling that'works real mischief to the community.
Horse races happen five times a week, whilst Tatt.’s lot-
tery is a comparatively rare event. An investment in a
“consultation” ticket doesn’t create a taste for horse-
racing and distract the investor’s attention from his
work. It is the punting habit that brings men and
women to grief. And Gillott’s effort to “ stamp out the
evil ” threatens to have the effect of encouraging this
punting habit by blocking the one comparatively harm-
less outlet for the gambling spirit.
* * * *
John Porter, the ablest, most fortunate, and
probably the oldest trainer of racehorses in England, is
going to retire from business at the end of the present
season. Porter’s chief employers for the last half-cen-
tury, or so, have been wealthy, successful men, with
“handles” to their names, who bought and bred the
highest class of animals, and never descended to sharp
practices. He was “ Honest John Porter . when he
trained famous winners for Sir Joseph Hawley in the 60’s
of last century, and it was his reputation for skill and in-
tegrity that brought him the patronage of the millionaire
Duke of Westminster, from whose Derby winner, Bend
’Or descended Ormonde, and other gees of great price.
The history of Porter’s stable at Kingscleric has no dirty
spots on it. In the course of his prosperous career he had
charge, for a few months, of a few horses belonging to a
drunken person. The fool in question couldn t run them
on the cross, for the jockey took his instructions from
Porter; but the power to scratch the horses at the last
moment, after they had been heavily backed by the
public, was always with the owner. He played the
scratching trick once or twice, and he wouldn’t under-
take to do it no more when Porter called him to account.
So the “servant” told the “master” to find another
stable for his malodorous horses within a week.
* * * *
The touts at Caulfield last week announced that
Murmur had reappeared on the track after an ominous
absence. Murmur is always alluded to as “ the Cup can-
didate,” but he isn’t likely to go to the poll.
• * * *
Seven A.J.C. Derby aspirants were out at
Rosehill on Saturday, and, bar Lady Wallace, none im-
pressed over much, but the filly named, spite of her un-
accountable defeat when backed down to first favoritism
for Spring Stakes at Tatt.’s meet a week before, and de-
spite a bad start, came up on the outside and won nicely
enough to prompt the belief that she’ll take some beating
in the big event. Other - Derby candidates w’ho shaped
during the day were Dantzic, Jargoon, Binnia, E.L.C.,
Lochino and North Head, but, bar the first two, there
was nothing the least bit encouraging in their displays.
Jargoon, much tipped and backed (by: the public gener-
ally) for one or other or both the coming big Victorian
Cups, will need to improve a great deal to succeed.
r * * * *
Steeplechase at Rosehill (Saturday) was a de-
pressing thing, and an object lesson on the poverty of
N.S.W. regarding good-class jumpers. Of a dozen carded,
only six started, and four failed to finish. First favorite
Arezzo (5 to 4 against) and Delos had the last round to
themselves, but the former caused his backers consider-
able suffering during the earlier portion of the infliction
bv rapping successive fences hard, and creating the fear
that each following one would see him come a heavy
cropper. Burnima fell in the first round, and, a little
later, Royal Standard, when a dozen lengths in front,
turned head over heels, and brought Oarusa with him,
while the very next obstacle proved disastrous to Unan-
derra. Riders Grimes and Humphries suffered slight con-
cussion and were badly Bruised.
* * • *
Arrival of Maonland crack, Maniopoto, last
week excited much interest in Sydney turfdom, and, at
moment of writing, nothing better than seven’s can be
bad about his chance in Epsom Handicap. T’other nag,
Machine Gun, from same quarter, who gave a taste of his
quality in Tatt.’s Tramway Handicap, at Rand wick,
Saturday week, is at ten’s. M.L. champions are thus first
a.id second favorites for the A.J.C.’s big mile event.
Possible that heavy backing of Maniopoto may not be
justified—he has never beaten a good class horse, though
he has a long list of successes to his credit, and only ran
unplaced twice. Maoriland contingent at Randwick now
includes, besides the two mentioned, Nightfall, Nocti-
form, Sungod, Isolt, and Haydn.
* ♦ * *
That much-thought-of colt of 12 months ago,
Warroo, on his showing in winning Rosehill Handicap
(lm. 3f.) last Saturday, looks like doing what he promised
before going amiss subsequent to A.J.C. Autunin meet.
Still Warroo needs careful handling and is consequently
causing trainer J. Burton some anxiety. Epsom or
Metro]), early next month are not beyond his powers—(he
has 8.4 in one and 8.1 in the other) and if he keeps right
he’ll have troops of friends, for Caulfield (7.11) and Mel-
bourne (8.2) Cups. Queenslander Truce (brother to top-
notcher Fitz Grafton) looked like winning the Rosehill
Handicap up to the half distance but Warroo stayed too
long. Possible that if Truce’s final run had been delayed
a bit he might have just scooped the money.
vr * *
Sydney Noses last week “backed down quickly.”
In meeting assembled on Friday, they capitulated—
to all intents unconditionally, though alleging as an
excuse Rosehill Club's undertaking not to further increase
betting fees for three years. This compact might have
been entered into at the outset, as it wasn’t likely after
such a big jump that the clubs would exact additional
toll for some time to come. At an immediately previous
meeting Mo. had given out that he was prepared to cave
in “ if the clubs felt disposed to grant some concession,
even a slight one, on the proposed licensing- fees.” He
was on his knees then, and the action of the A.J.C.
licensing committee in sitting on Thursday and Friday to
consider applications for registration from new Noses
crushed the last shred of the old ones’ kick. The unkind-
est cut of all, however, occurred at Rosehill the day after
Mo.’s humiliation, when he bumped a hotter time than
for many a month. Weighcily-supported nags won five
of the six races.
* * * *
Tho amount of trouble that is caused by friendly
drinks with the banker is incalculable. One of the
stewards of a Maoriland racing club was having a
friendly wet with the banker, and took occasion to remark
that they would have to place the club’s balance on fixed
deposit, and make it earn a bit. The banker retorted
that it would be a good idea—when the club got a
balance. The steward expostulated, the banker grew
vehement, arid said that instead of a balance there was a
big debit. Then investigations took place, and a warrant
was issued for the arrest of somebody who had gone to
Fiji, the place where the rich uncles come from.
•K * * *
The progress of the Australian Rugger team
in Maoriland is depressing—three matches played, and all
lost, with only 13 points scored to 43. On the other
hand, the optimistic may derive consolation from the
fact that the margin of defeat grows gradually less. The
first match saw Australia crushed by 16 points (7 to 23) ;
the second by niue (3 to 12); and the third, that against
Canterbury on Saturday, by five (3 to 8). But each of the
teams played has been less ferocious than the previous
one, and what may happen to the Australians when they
strike an AU-Maoriland team on Saturday is calculated to
make patriotic blood run cold. In the match against
Canterbury the Australians found the ground heavy.
The Australian back division is reported as failing
miserably at line kicking, and is charged with wild
passing, and with fumbling on the rare occasions when
the passing was decent.
* * * *
Saturday’s developments in Sydney metropoli-
tan Rugby did not affect the destination of the premier-
ship. South Sydney continued its career of conquest by
the scientific annihilation of Newtown—the amazing
score was 23 to 6. Glebe had a pleasant afternoon killing
Balmain—ll to nil. So these two winning clubs are still
first and second on the premiership list—South Sydney
25, and Glebe 24. University is third with 21, which, at
this stage of the competition, is serious.
* * * *
N.S.W. League Premiership competition under
Australian football rules came to an end on Saturday at
Sydney Cricket Ground, where Sydney and Y.M.C.A.
played the final. Of late the Y.M.C.A. has not shown up
to its standard of the earlier part of the season. Satur-
day’s match seems to have turned on the use the com-
petitors could make of the Wind that blew across the
ground. At first it was in favor of the Good Young Men,
and at the end of the quarter they led by 16 points to 6.
Then the red legs got the aid of the breeze, and in the
second quarter the score became: Sydney 35 points,
Y.M.C.A. 16. When it got the use of the wind once more
Y.M.C.A. made a great effort to wipe out the difference,
but Sydney settled down to a good defensive game, and
when the "three-quarter bell rang Y.M.C.A., although it
had prevented Sydney adding to its score, had pulled up
to onlv 25 itself. Svdney started the final quarter 10
points to the good. Then the Y.M.C.A. lost faith—it is
even reported that one of the team said “ Damn ! ” That
finished its chances, and the end saw Sydney 51 points
and its opponents only 29. The victory gave Sydney the
premiership, with a record of 24 competition points for
the season. Y.M.C.A. is second with 20 points. The
Australian Rules premiership started in 1903, when it was
held by East Sydney. It passed to North Shore in 1904.
* ♦ * *
Victorian League football got a stage nearer the
end last Saturday, when some 40,000 spectators distri-
buted themselves at the three one-sided matches, South
v. Melbourne, Essenden v. Geelong, and ’Roy v. St. Kilda
—the first-named winning easily in each case. Another
20,000 or 22,000 trammed down to Victoria Park to see if
Carlton could burst up ’Wood’s famous systefn. It
couldn’t ! Within two minutes of starting the mag-
pies kicked a goal, and a quarter of an hour later
the score-board showed four goals to Carlton’s
one goal one behind, and, in spite, of strenuous
marking and kicking that lead was held to the finish—
’Wood coming out with nine goals 12 beliinds to Carlton’s
six goals 13- behinds. The plriy, before a shower at half-
time damped the grass and greased the ball, was fast and
clever. The dark blues were as good as ’Wood at marking
and kicking—superior, if anything—but if the ball came
near a magpie he mostly got it, and almost before
he got hold of it he had sent it on to a mate.
Carlton barrackers averred that, ’Wood’s system had
broken down, that they couldn’t play it on the wet
ground, that thre? of their best men were away—so they
were, hut nothing seemed to matter. In the Association,
West Melb. and North sustained unexpected d. feats at
the feet of Brunswick and Williamstown, w'herefore
West’s chance doesn’t look quite so good as heretofore,
but North, being still a game in the lead, looks like
repeating last year’s performance, and battling out the
final against Richmond. The South v. Melbourne debacle
was e mphasized by the collapse, when the bell rang, of
an excitable barraeker—an elderly gentleman with a weak
heart—who failed to stand the strain, and died there and
then. These elderly persons with weak hearts should
keep away from football.
Died at Brahran (Vic.),;recently, Billy Powell,
florist and trick cyclist. Powell was a marvellous example
of executive skill! as distinguished from originating skill,
in fancy cycling. Pie started as a mere child, when
Maltby visited Australia, and had all Maltbv’s wondrous
feats perfect in a couple of weeks. People predicted great
things of Powell, but with no Maltby to imitate he simply
remained in the same place. As soon as another great
trick rider arrived here, Powell had his business. He
could do everything he saw, but he failed to invent a
single act. Powell leaves a widow, whose plump and
pleasing personality came to the front in the days when
cycling boomed, as the winner of the only ladies’ race ever
held in Melbourne.

The Dunlop Individual Road Championship
contest on Saturday found the Homebush-Granville road
in a very dusty state, and there were enough punctures
among the 23 starters to suggest that some jocular devil
had gone over the road previously with a packet of tacks.
Only half the starters finished. As a matter of fact, it
was the pace that killed. H. K. Maxwell, of Enfield Club,
which beat Balmain for the Inter-Club Premiership, went
off at a tremendous burst, rushing over the first 10 miles
of the 30 in 26min. I7sec. V. AV. M'Lean, of the Western
Suburbs, was also on the rush, and skimmed over the
treacherous dust}' highway at tremendous speed, and,
taking the lead in the second round, he was never chal-
lenged ; in the last round, in fact, he rode the pacers all
out. Thompson, of the Eastern Suburbs, came away with
a bound at the last, but before he got properly going he
came down with a clang, and M‘Lean finished 50seo. to
the good. The time (lh. 22m. 42 3-ssec.) was, considering
the state of the road, exceedingly fast.
The Dunlop Tyre Co. has received a very
gratifying' entry for its big Inter-State Road Race, to
be held from YVarrnambool to Melbourne (165 miles) on
Sept. 30. Over 200 cyclists have nominated for the Blue
Riband Event, including representatives from every State
and Maoriland. *

According to a letter from Australian bike-
pusher George Farley, now in Europe, “ doping ” is an
everyday practice amongst Continental top-notchers.
Most of the cracks absorb some drug freely to put them
through races ; the dispenser-in-chief being Henri Mayer,
the German flyer, who is reckoned the speediest man on
the world’s tracks to-day. Farley opines that the “dope ”
is the chief reason why the record of the average Euro-
pean champion consists of a short and brilliant career and
a hopeless and premature break-up.

Sydney’s lacrosse premiership competition ended
on Saturday, the only game being between North Sydney
and Balmain. It was a good g'ame, but whichever way it
ended made no difference in the destination of the
premiership, Balmain being so far ahead : therefore it
did not arouse much interest. Balmain won by 9to 6.
Its record has been brilliant compared to that of its
nearest rival, North Sydney. The men from the tattered
suburb won 10 out of the 12 matches played, scoring 69
goals to 23 scored against them, and won the competition
by eight points. The Canadian national game seems to
have obtained its firmest root in S. Australia, which has
twice produced the continent’s record-breaking team.
The first record was when a S. Australian team beat
N.S.W. team by 26 to nil. The second was on Saturday
last, when the formidable Sturt Club team, playing East
Torrens, threw 29 goals while the vanquished scored
three. The Sturt team will visit Melbourne shortly, in
search of more scalps. The Melbourne premiership was
appropriated by the St. Hilda club, which, after a
strenuous conflict, defeated M.C.C. by five goals, to two.
M.C.C. came second on the list, with Essendon, where
Bent is going to run his motor ears to, third.
The Five Miles Cross Country Championship
of N.S.W. contest was this year true to its name, the
course being one and three-quarter laps round the Can-
terbury racecourse, through the bush to Croydon Park,
up a hill, past the golf-links, and back to the racecourse.
Eighty-four lined up, all sorts and conditions of runners,
and went off at a dog-trot. The tail started to develop at
once, and what between cramps, stitches, and falls over
hurdles, the first mile saw considerable wreck. Then the
fleetest got away and started back and overtook the lag-
gards, and it was hard to distinguish the winners from
the losers. Some jumped over the hurdles that had been
kicked over by the men who had gone before, and
carefully avoided those still standing, some ran round
everything, and altogether it was a sorry show.
The'management was downright bad, and proceedings
started nearly an hour late. Eventually the committee,
or managers, or whatever they called themselves, sorted
out that R. B. Fitzbarding, of the Sydney Harriers, had
won the individual championship, and the team to which
he belonged had appropriated the championship. The
time (34min. 35sec.) was dead slow. These fellows will
have to brighten up if they are going to keep ahead of the
Japs when the invasion happens along.
Captain Webb’s Channel swim still stands in
splendid isolation on the record, although quite an army
of aspirants have been swimming wildly through the
press during the past and present month. Many threat-
ened, but few attempts have been 1 reported, so apparently
most of them were content with their performances in
printers’ ink. Burgess, Miss Kellermann, and a new man
who swam under the heavy handicap of a name like Pro-
fessor Mew, started together last Thursday, but after
going 11 miles gave up through “ sea-sickness.” Holbein,
who made yet another attempt, gave up after 16 miles had
been covered. Miss Kellermann did wonderfully well to
stay as long as her two companions, one of whom,
Burgess, is an exceptionally powerful man. What is
described as “ sea-sickness ” is more likely to have been
throat-paralysis, caused by spray catching the breath, a
happening that has been responsible for the drowning of
many a strong swimmer. The latest failures were the
fourth bv Burgess and the sixth by Holbein. But as this
was Holbein’s first attempt this season he will probably be
heard from again within the next few days.

Why the defeat of ex-Maoriland sculler, Tom
Sullivan, by Hanlan’s nephew Durnan, at Toronto, last
week, should have surprised sporting scribes so much is
hard to conjecture. ' Sullivan has done no rowing for
years and years, and ran a pub in the meantime, which is
not the sort of thing, brethren, that a man thrives on
athletically, however he may prosper otherwise. Ex-
champion George Towns tipped Sullivan to win because
he found Durnan painfully slow while he was in Canada,
four years ago. But he apparently did not take into con-
sideration Sullivan’s long spell at the beer-pump, or the
fact that he had been growing no younger for some years.
Thirteen years ago Stanbury beat Sullivan on the Parra-
matta, and the latter went to England and cut Bubear’s
throat for the Sportsman Challenge Cup, after which he
went under to Harding twice in succession. Just possible
that Durnan, in the excitement of having- at last really
done something, may come to Australia to look at Stan-
bury. But it is only possible !

Letters deceived in Adelaide go to show that
there is an excuse for Newland’s poor showing in England.
On the steamer, after leaving Maoriland. a slashing hit
with a cricket-ball took him at close quarters on the
cheek-bone, fairly lifting his jaw off its hinges. Dentist
Noble and the ship’s doctor were occupied all the after-
noon getting it in place again, and even after reaching
London Newland had to see a specialist about it. That
sort of experience may well shake a man’s nerve—and a
wicket-keeper’s especially—just enough to make the
difference between a first-rate and a moderate.
At the present time the best of the English
bowlers, with one or two exceptions, are in Che Yorkshire
or Lancashire elevens. The Yorkshire “ cracks ” —Haigh,
Rhodes, and Hirst—have been comparative failures
against the Australians this trip, but two other members
of the team—Ringrose and Jackson—did surprisingly
well. And in the Lancashire match last week, when
Brearley and Kermode were standing out, a new man.
Cook, took five wickets—Trumper, Hill, Noble, Gehrs and
Kelly—all of them clean bowled.
•* * * ♦
Sid Gregory has been the unlucky player in the
Australian XI. Sunstroke, ptomaine poisoning, and a
strained back kept him out of the team for over a month.
Last week he re-appeared and piled up 92 runs.
* * * *
The talk of a match between the returning XI.
and the Rest of Australia stopped with a sudden bang
when the magnitude of the debacle struck the public
intellect at the conclusion of the fifth test. There will be
no heroes among the returning XI., and in all probability
the team will steal home with the early burglar, and hide
itself and its gains after the same manner.' It will proba-
bly be too soared to come out of its hole to curse the Aus-
tralian Board of Control, which it was going- to decline to
recognise unless it was crawled to.
* * * *
The ridiculous idea of giving Melbourne Cricket
Club separate representation on the Australian Board of
Control is to be foug'ht out in conference between the
N.S.W., Vic. and Queensland Associations and the Mel-
bourne Club. N.S.W. and Q. strenuously object to the
proposal, while, for some mysterious reason, the Vic.
Association upholds the bounder club in its arrogant
demand. M O.C. badly wants putting in its proper
place.
* * * *
“B.B.” : Although the Australian XI. has made
a holy show of our native land in the Cold Country, it is,
according to private advices, piling up the shekels in a
way that threatens to break the record. The Australian
“ amateurs ” confidently hope to divide such a bag that
each amateur will get away with four figures worth. The
British barrackers have shelled out liberally to see the
Australians defeated. They like it.
Cotter’s 12 wickets for 182 runs against Kent
raised his bag of victims to 102, at an average of a trifle
over 20. Although the fast bowler has not beeivsensa-
tional, his efforts towards the latter end of the tour
were more than useful. “Broken Hill” Jones’s initial
effort on English wickets scooped in only 71 trophies, and
Jones was hailed as a wonder. But Cotter has eclipsed
Jones, and, being young and vigorous, with a lot to learn
and plenty of time to learn it in, there’s no reason why he
shouldn’t improve sufficiently to become almost a neces-
sity. Armstrong (105 wickets, average 17) and Laver (99,
average 18) head the bowling averages.

Passed out, at Sydney, the other day, aged 64,
“ Geordie ” Cowan, one-time noted wrestler. He brought
an English reputation to Victoria in 1863 ; then passed
over to Maoriland, where he made some money by digging
at the Otago and West Coast goldfields, and some more
by laying out the local wrestlers. Later on, be reached
Sydney, where he defeated Jack Hayes, Staples, Hudson,
Rock and others. In his later years, he got in some good
training work, among those he “got up” being Peter
Jackson, when that pug. defeated Tom Lees for the cham-
pionship of Australia, and oarsman “ Billy ” Beach. Like-
wise, he prepared a host of peds., during the Joseph
Banks and Carrington boom days.
That greased Pathan, Buttan Singh, who calls
himself champion catch-as-catch-can wrestler of Aus-
tralia and the adjacent islands, is becoming more or less
of a joke. Maorilander Scott is willing to meet Buttan,
and the Asiatic declares that he is just dying to place
Scott on the mat, but his manager won't let him. Re-
cently, when Buttan was exhibiting at Eootscray, and
offering £lO to any man who could stand before him for
ten minutes, Scott approached and asked that the money
should be handed to any reliable person in the hall.
Buttan’s manager objected, and he also objected to pro-
fessional wrestlers taking up the £lO challenge. A cham-
pion who won’t meet all comers is not a champion. But
perhaps Buttan’s manager draws the color line !
That wrestling match between Maoriland
middle champion George Riordan, of the West Coast, and
top-notcher George Ournow, of N.S.W., at the Sydney
Gaiety Club last week was not. a howling success finan-
cially, iust because everyone believed Riordan had no
hope. He had been unable, through adverse circum-
stances, to train at all, and the thing was looked upon as
a joke. When they got together Ournow scored first fall
immediately, but it was an accident—Riordon slipped
while trying to make a bridge. Then the Maorilander got
down to it, and, with a neck-hold like a vice, threw
Ournow very decisively. In the third bout Ournow came
to grief again, being pinned.hopelessly with an arm-lock.
The unexpected is startling, but does not always pay.
* * " * *
Tim Hegarty, one of the cleverest and least
reliable boxers in the business, having been barred by the
Sydney National, has succeeded in getting a few engage-
ments in Melbourne, all unsatisfactory. His fight with
voung Dick Cullen—the hunky American whom N.S.W.
featherweight Murphy defeated—at Melbourne Athletic
Club’s rooms, the other night, drew a large crowd. It
went all the way (20 rounds) and was a fairly busy busi-
ness most' of the time, but never looked like a really
strenuous- competition. What might have been an ex-
planation of this came when referee Sam Grey flourished
a blue document, and declared a draw, the boxers having
agreed in the articles that it was to be considered a draw
if both were capable of taking the last round standing up.
Hegarty was well ahead in every round, but apparently
did not put in a solid effort at any time, otherwise
Cullen, sturdy and game as he is, could not have outlived
it. When boxers arrange their own decisions beforehand
it would be an honest deal to advertise the fact along with
the other inducements.
* * * *
The disturbance between Mr. Robert Turner
and ex-silver miner Mat Mitchie, at Sydney Gaiety, on
Saturday night, was a cheerful slogging match. Turner
poked a* violent left, and Mitchie whirled a ferocious right,
and the fact they both went on swinging those weapons
for the full 20 rounds inspires this paper with a genuine
disrespect for both bruisers. The referee said Mr. Turner
was the better bruiser of the two, and it is just possible
that the referee was right.
* * ■* *
There was nothing Homeric about the Hock
Keys-Mont.v Andrews fight for the lightweight champion-
ship at Sydney National Sporting Club last week. Hock
Keys knew all about where to hit, but he.lacked strength,
and Monty didn’t seem much the worse when Keys had
hit him. Montague has a face like a fortification, and
against it Keys’ light artillery didn’t even raise a respec-
table dust. On the other hand, Andrews was depressed
by the knowledge that Keys could hit him when and
where he liked, and his respect for his weak but accom-
plished opponent prevented him making as good a showing
as he might have done. And when occasionally Montague
did get some devil into his attack, Keys showed such
swift footwork that Andrews immediately fell into a sort
of reverie of admiration. So the thing dragged the full
20 rounds, when it was announced that Keys had failed,
and the champion retained his title. Still, although it
could hardly be called a fight, it is always a pleasure to
see Hock Keys wave his fists about, and all save a few
bloodthirsty Philistines felt that they had got their
money’s worth.

TO THE ANTI-TATT. CRUSADERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Good and greasy men who utter
Hard remarks about our weakness,
Pray remember that a flutter
In a lottery or sweep
Teaches sinners resignation,
And humility and meekness,
Such as gentle shepherds ever
Are prescribing for their sheep.
Ye are happy in the mercies
Gracious heaven is vouchsafing ;
For ye never know reverses
If ye never try your luck ;
But we others drop our money,
Yea, we lose it without chafing,
And we call our Christian spirit
By the vulgar name of “ pluck.”
Let us gamble in our blindness,
Let us suffer, as of yore,
Whilst Heavenward complacently ye amble.
We are surely being chastened
By the Tatt. whom we adore.
Let us gamble, gentle shepherds, let us gamble.
Now, the self-indulgent boozer,
He is never crushed and humbled
Like the uncomplaining loser
Who is waiting for a prize ;
And he offers no petitions
Such as we have often mumbled
To the lady-god of Fortune,
Dwelling somewhere in the skies.
Sure, the sweeps were sent to lead us
Into prayer and tribulation,
Whilst the sermons that ye read us
Fall on very stony ground ;
O, a vice must make for virtue
In a young and foolish nation,
If the sin with disappointment
Be so generally 7 crowned.
Let us gamble in our blindness,
Let us suffer all the time
Loss of dollars in the fascinating scramble,
We are disciplined by sorrow,
And our patience is sublime—
Let us gamble, gentle shepherds, let us gamine.

became bloated with wind and
giddy, had splitting headaches and
grew weak, nervous, pale and lan-

THE DUNLOP PNEUMATIC TYRE CO. OF A C/S-,

A parson named Margoschis from Madras has
drifted over here to tell us that “if Australia is
to be prosperous she must employ alien labor,”
and that “ the policy of a White Australia must
break down.” The world seems a great deal too
full of slanderers like Margoschis, or Gosh, or
whatever he is called, who preach the doctrine that
the Anglo-Saxon is a poor, useless, played-out
person who must go to ruin unless he gets a nigger
to work for him. This same Margoschis indi-
vidual threatens an Indian boycott of Australian
goods. It is to be hoped that it will come, and
come soon. The only reason why Australia has
so much raw material to export is that it sells its
products to the manufacturing populations of
other countries in exchange for goods, instead of
exchanging them with the manufacturing popula-
lation of its own country. The boycott which will
force it to grow its own manufacturing population
can’t arrive too early.

A police-court item :
Melbourne boasts a police constable named Mick Holden
—known as “ Mick of Flinders-street ” to the sailors of all
the world, who hold him in holy terror. Mick is a man
of prodigious strength, and his evidence in the Oity
Police Court is generally of this nature : Ph two
acc-hused min were ma-akin’ a dishtur-rbance. Oi
seized wan in each hand. They resist-hed voi -
entlv. Oi t’rew thim into a cab, an’ conve-eved
thim t’ th’ Bourke-shtreet-wist lock-up.” The other Sun-
day nio'ht, however, Mick met a snag- in the shape of
Michael Harrington. Michael threw insulting names at
Mick while Mick was arresting Gorman. Mick stated:
“Oi tuk th’ mahn Gor-rman t’ th’watch-house, an come
back t’ where Oi lift Har’ngton.” Harrington, mean-
while, had gone into the restaurant of Hannah Joughlin,
and when Mick found him, the air became thick with
excitement and broken cook-shop. In the ns-thaur-ant
one John Way joined in on behalf of Michael Harrington.
The slack of Michael’s pants and his coat-collar gave Mick
a hoult, and Mick proceeded to carry Michael out. Michael,
after kicking Mick on nearly every part of the body,
clung to a table. Mick lifted him hoigher, an th table
dhropped. A sewing-machine, a dressing-table, and
Hannah Coughlin dropped also. Then Michael coiled his
legs around those of the table, and Mick dragged him and
the table, and most of the restaurant furniture as well,
through the door. At this moment another policeman,
Wheelahan turned up and accounted for John Way, who was
hanging to the hinder end of the furniture. Then Holden
and Wheelahan took their captives to the watch-house,
gathering on the road William George King and Mary
Johnson. After bits of the table and fragments of Hannah
Coughlin’s furniture generally had been extracted from
all parties concerned, the batch was brought before the
City Police Court, to he fined £l6 among them, king-
street would willingly pay the fines twice over for the
joy of seeing- another such fray.
Thus Minister Peter Airey, in Queens-
land :
It is said that one of the ancient Ojesars offered a prize
to anyone who would invent a new pleasure. It is alleged
concerning the Treasurer that he has invented, not a new
pleasure, hut a new vice—the vice of paying out of
revenue what was formerly paid out of loan. I hope trie
disease may prove infectious, that it may spread rapidly.
But I am afraid the members of the Philp party are proof
against the contagion. They are much more likely to
revert to the pleasing practice of paying out of loan wliat
our Treasurer is paying out of revenue. . . . lhe ambi-
tion of this Government is to go on paying its way, and
to avoid borrowing for the next few years If we can
honestly pay our way, avoid borrowing, and do without
sellino- lands for revenue purposes, we shall have accom-
plished about the biggest thing tl at has yet been done in
the domain of Australian finance. This ambiti >n may
not be a very lofty one, but it certainly is a very honest
one.
Embing, M.L.C., of Victoria, as a reason
for opposing the Women’s Suffrage Kill, said that
“ Women resented being obliged to go out at night
and take part in political addresses.” Enabling
evidently thinks that there is a law whereby
women, as Federal voters, are dragged to political
meetings by tbe police, and tied to their seats by
the back hair till the proceedings are over. It is
a dreadful thing to think that such a person as
Enabling should have a vote, let alone a seat in
Parliament.
Federal Treasurer Forrest proposes that
the Commonwealth and the States should “ work
together ” to bring out immigrants, the Common-
wealth bringing out the immigrants and the
States providing the land. But, if this is done,
the Commonwealth takes the responsibility of
bringing out the immigrants, and the States—
which generally leave the Commonwealth in the
lurch —may not provide the land. It would be
much better for the Commonwealth to provide
work for immigrants in manufacturing industries
by a vigorous Protectionist tariff, and to find the
land itself by breaking up big estates with a
Federal graduated land-tax.
Premier Bent, wlio is a councillor himself
and knows the ways of municipal potentates, has
at last fallen foul of the bumptious Vic. Munici-
pal Association. The association has been m the
habit of getting 206 copies of each new Parliamen-
tary Bill —one for each council. Then it sent
them round and invited comments, and this prac-
tice usually resulted in 206 municipal bodies bray-
ing irrelevant advice at Bent, most of it being
ignorant and illogical and contradictory and
ungrammatical advice. Bent finally wearied, and
told the association that if it wanted 206 copies of
the Dairies Supervision Bill they could be had at
Is. each ; also, that it “knew as much about legis-
lation as the fifth wheel of a coach.” Bent is an
unmannerly cuss, but there are times when good
manners are wasted.
There is a certain moral in the fact that
the steamer Prinz Waldemar’s Chinese stowaways,
recently refused a landing at Sydney, and after-
wards sentenced to hard labor in German
Papua, are dropping out like diseased sheep.
Of the 23 five have died—from “ the hard labor in
the climate,” their sympathisers say. Still the
Australian colored labor crowd alleges that the
Chow’s capacity for hard work in a hot climate
in ikes him the ideal employee for the Queensland
sugar plantations—that he can work and thrive
where the white man would melt. Yet the white
man works in Papua without losing anything like
21 per cent, of his number in a month or so.
“ The trade” in N.S. Wales professes to be
a good deal alarmed at the prospect of Carruthers’
liquor legislation, and the Sydney air is thick
with petitions, in which the citizens are urged to
put a bulwark of signatures around their threatened
beer. But, all the same, Bung probably recognises
that the Prohibition cause is but a Boyce crying
in the wilderness. Maoriland is kind enough to
experiment with Prohibition. That will almost
certainly save the Commonwealth from a painful
experience.
The eloquent bitterness of a shocked
friend on learning the sorry news that an aged
and faithful laborer in the far corners of the
Vineyard, obeying the call of the old homeland
in his declining years, had gone back to die of
neglect:—

THE STANDARD FAMILY MEDICINE.
Throughout Australasia Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a household remedy, and the antidote for all general ailments. In
thousands of homes the little amber bottle is the sole medicine chest, for there are few complaints in which Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills cannot 'be administered without beneficial results. The many wonderful cures effected by Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have awakened
the interest of all classes of the community to the merits of these Pills. Years ago, pills were the medicine of the poor only. To-day the
efficacy of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills to overcome the common ailments of mankind has convinced not only the working section of the
population, but the more wealthy, professional and independent classes that Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are the best family medicine.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have come to stay. They are an efficient, reliable and safe remedy, placed on the market at a price within the
reach of all. The Pills, being sugar-coated, are pleasant to take, and retain their full medicinal properties. They are packed in amber-
colored botlles—not in cheap wooden or pasteboard boxes—and are thus always fresh and clean, impervious to moisture, unaffected by climatic
conditions, and do not deteriorate by keeping as all liquid medicines do. The prudent housewife always keeps a bottle in the house for she
has learnt by experience that Nature occasionally requires some assistance, and that this assistance is best afforded by prompt recourse to
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. Many a serious illness may also be prevented by the timely use of these Pills, the disease in its
primary stage. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, being purely vegetable, do not weaken, sicken or gripe, and may be taken with perfect safety
by the most delicate woman or the youngest child. The old and feeble will also find them a most suitable remedy for aiding and
strengthening their weakened constitutions.
DR. MORSES INDIAN ROOT PILLS are a Perfect Blood Purifier, and a Sure Cure for Biliousness, Constipation,
Indigestion, Headaches, Sallow Complexion, Liver and Kidney Troubles, Piles, Pimples, Boils, and for Female Ailments/
THEY DO NOT WEAKEN. THEY DO NOT SICKEN. THEY DO NOT GRIPE.

Mr. GEORGE WHITE, of Junction Street, JUNEE, N.S.W., writes: “ Dear Sirs,—it is
now 13 years ago since I was attacked with a terrible complaint, and my Doctor told
me I had Gall Stones. He treated me for twelve months and I was no beiter, I then
went to Melbourne, and a doctor there told me the same thing, and said there was no
cure for me. I have suffered with my back ever since, until four months ago, wbcn I
purchased ono of your Electric Belts. Since wearing it I can truly say that I have not
felt better for years. I am sure that it has cured my back for ever, and I never regret
the money i have paid for it.”

Recent copper find at-Orange Plains, Dandaloo
(N.S.W.), by that persistent prospector, Fishpoole, is
likely to push the field into notice. So far development
work on the line of lode covers several thousand feet
Shows have been opened up to a depth of 200 ft., and at
this level the lode exposure on two properties shows as
much as 10ft. of clean ore of well up towards 20 per cent.
At Orange Plains there is more surface copper than on
any other known field in N.S.W. Most of the country is
now pegged, and something considerable in the way of
floats is in the wind.
* * * *
C.S.A., Cobar (N.S.W.), which started on a
copper-finding mission under the guidance of well-known
Cobar copper men, now unexpectedly falls on a silver-
lead deposit. The ore is foreign to Cobar field, and so
far is rich in silver and lead ; but there certainly isn’t
sufficient work yet done to make it possible to say how
much there is of it. Shares have, however, bounced up
from £5O to £2OO on expectations. But, then, Coppa-
bellas bounced just the same way ; and the disrespectful
rebound wasn’t accompanied by any apology.
* * * *
Queen Bee (N.S.W.), with 50 tons copper for
last month’s run, did better than was expected. Ore
bodies at lower -levels, so far as development has gone,
also leave not much room for complaint. Mine is un-
doubtedly opening up well, and, if present output can be
maintained, there’s no reason why the monthly 3d.
shouldn’t continue and a little be put by to meet the dis-
appointments that must always happen."
* * * *
The man with the silver slug in one pocket and
the syndicate prospectus in the other is having a better
time than he has had all these long dry years, since
Zeehan and Dundas (Tas.) followed close on the heels of
the Barrier boom. The one thing, apart .from the slugs,
that has given Coppabella the lilt the syndicate promotor
needed, has been the statement that Bewick-Moreing are
smiling on the Coppabella Prop. Claims have been taken
up all over the district, which is handy, to Jingellic, on
the N.S.W. side of the Murray, and not far from where
the Dora Dora blacks came from. As to whether divi-
dends will be easier to catch than those departed black
brothers were, Thu Bulletin hasn’t any fixed opinions at
present; but it will try to make up its mind before next
week, when it will probably have some definite remarks
to make for the usual sixpence.
**- * *
Visiting day at Mills United, Charters Towers,
is once a month ; and you need the month to get the order.
All the gushing is' done on the strength of the block
between Nos. 8 and 7 ; that, as far as looks go, is good and
well opened up. A leading stope taken off No. 8 for some
300 ft., and five rises 120 ft. long connecting with No. 7,
show that the block will average 4ft. of mineral stone.
Development work is slow, 150 ft. a fortnight, considering
it is, except at No. 6, all on stone, from 2ft. 6in. to 6ft.
thick, and so should pay for itself. No. 6 is still in
diorite, not having reached the slide yet, and the stone is
beyond that. A rise put up in advance of the end of No.
6 level shows that the stone lives right up ; although
poverty-stricken compared with No. 8, it should carry
gold. Bottom level (No. 10) is doing nicely on 6ft. of
crushing stuff, in two seams—4ft. of whitish stone with
2ft. of mineral stone underneath. When the Towers has
a split reef like this it is called “ fair stone.” An estimate
is arrived at by spitting on the sample pieces; if
gold can be seen by candle-light it is “good”; if it
is necessary to have daylight and a glass, it is only
“medium.” If no gold is to be seen it is “fair.”
Reports are a work of art, and never fail to paint No. 8
in letters of gold; yet no attempt is made to let share-
holders know; what its value is, or the tonnage it contains.
Doubtless some people know, else why such mysterious
whisperings concerning the life, of the block? Co. has a
capital of £300,000 in £1 shares, represented wholly by the
surface plant and the 100 acres lease. The Block and
Wyndham crushes jor it. Shares at time of writing
stand at 235. and are tipped to see 30s. Difficult to find
the value in the property, as, roughly speaking-, there is
not 10s. in dividends in sight; more like ss. Although,
without a doubt, development will open up more stone,
one has to remember that 300 ft. further in the eastern
levels will find the boundary.

Cabled that amalgamation, to work the streets,
between Mills United and D.D.F. Consolidated, Charters
Towers, is as good as fixed up. Arrangement is that a
new co. is to be formed, with a capital of £200,000, in
150,000 paid-ups and 50,000 contributings. To be called
Pfeiffer’s Day Dawn. The Consolidated to go under.
Mills co. gets 75,000 paids and 25,000 contribs'; the other
half go to. Consolidated holders. Contribs will be paid up
to; 6s. Stated that; Mills’ lot are not for distribution.
Deal seems fair. The 40 acres that Mills hands over was
too far west for that co. to work profitably ; and the Con-
solidated could not work its own ground unless the streets
were open. Consolidated, a while ago, bustled the tribu-
tors out, and applied for and got six months’ exemption.
* * * V
Taylor, of the Victory, Charters Towers, always
had a dread of tributors discovering something
that he had missed. Some, time back applications were
invited from tributors for blocks, but none were let. Still
the management profited by information (per medium of
percentage) contained in tributors’ tender forms. Later
on, Tuckett and party got into No. 1 Victory ; last crush-
ing was 53. tons for 3980 z., worth, with concentrates and
residues, £1767 ; in May 133 tons gave 5050 z. Reef will
average 10 inches, and the same quality stone is being
left in the Victory ground. Clark’s Brilliant Worcester
and Victory may yet get a smell of it in its lease, but is
sitting back as cash is short.

A correspondent, on some N.Q. railway schemes:
Re the Chiilagoe Co.’s nonsense as to the Chillagoe-
Etheridge line being necessary' for Etheridge mines, and
the yarn that Etheridge miners would send their ore to
the smelters at Chiilagoe for treatment. Chiilagoe is
much too small a tail to wag so big a dog as Etheridge ;
and it may end in Chiilagoe ores being sent to Georgetown
to flux Etheridge ores. Fact is, it’s much cheaper to rail
the small percentage of coke needed to the smelters than
to rail the ores ; and when the line is built it will simply
mean smelters on Etheridge, while Chiilagoe will still be
looking for ore. Extension of Croydon line to George-
town would soon prove the much-talked-of Etheridge.
The fact of the Chiilagoe crowd having made a mess of
their pudding is one reason why they shouldn't have
the chance of repeating their failure at Georgetown ; it
isn’t a reason why they should have the chance, as they
suggest Let the State run a light line from Croydon to
Georgetown* and so let any'one and everyone start on
the same footing on the Etheridge problem. No good can
come from letting one crowd, company', or syndicate get
a prior right, or monopoly, or upper hand—especially a
crowd with “ Failure ” written so big across its record.

“Hillard”; Around Ipswich, West Moreton
(Q-), there are great quantities of iron ore—thousands of
tons of it is estimated-at Pine-Mountain, three miles from
town. Limestone* and a class of coal suitable for the
manufacture ,of pig-iron, also exist. Notwithstanding
everything’ necessary thus on the spot, no start has, so
far, been made in the direction of founding ironworks of
even small dimensions, although as far back as 20 odd
years ago it was “contemplated.” About that time
there was voted in Parliament £5OOO as a bonus for the
establishment of ironworks and the making of pig-iron.
The conditions were that substantially' equipped works,
costing at least £lO,OOO, were to be erected, and that a
minimum quantity- of a certain number of thousands of
tons of pig-iron was to he made before the subsidy could ■
be claimed. The chance didn’t look good enough at the
price. Last session, Grant, M.L.A. (Rockhaniptori), en-
deavored to revive interest in the ironworks subject, and
the matter has now reached the stage when “steps may-
be taken.” V

Gold has been cut in the 4226 ft. crosscut in the
New Chum Railway, Bendigo. This is the deepest spot
on the planet at which the metal has been got, and about
the hottest. Temperature is probably 90 degrees at
bottom of the, centre-country winze, but the rock is so
hot that a black nor’-easter is icy compared to the
dread stuffiness down there. Co. has to sink its shaft
from 3896 ft. to 4250 ft. before it can open up the formation
properly. The sink, with 470 ft. of cross cutting, means a
good 15 months graft. ' A drive put north and south on
the leg shows about 4ft. of quartz at the top, and 2ft. in
the bottom. Some niqe shotty gold is visible, but in the
light of last week’s yield the most that ought to be said
is that the outlook is promising. It cannot be-forgotten
that no long shoot of payable stone has yet been proved
below 3000 ft. on the field.

Berry Extended, Creswick (Vic.), has not been
panning out at all well lately-. Cause, poorness of wash
more than any crush on the timber, though that helps to
pile up costs. Miners look askance at the south work
ings. Water is heavy, and croakers hint that the Berry
No. 1 or Berry Consols back-water mav not be
far distant. Manager Ward pins his faith on" a
Berry No. 1 plan and on his checked surveys.
Faith won’t, however, bring much consolation should a
burst occur, and miners would feel a ton easier if a pump
were working on the Berry Consols No. 2 shaft. Other
local people feel the same, or they would not suggest that
the State should pump that claim. To ask this is, how-
ever, the finest bit of impudence attempted for many a
day. Pumps ought to be there, but the cost of running
them belongs to the Extended shareholder and not to the
taxpayer. Creswick folk aren’t built that way, though
and they will probably want Peacock to do a bit of log-
rolling. ®

Melbourne market has two alluvial enigmas.
One is the Main Leads North, out of which there seems to
be a steady flitting, despite good yields ; and the other is
(whisper it!) the Great Southern Consols. Both co. ’s pay
monthly sixpenny divs., and therefore shares ought to be
at 20s. But shooting is done off the 10s. mark. Water is
not the trouble. What is it ? The veil was not lifted at
the Main Leads North meeting, but a stray breeze
has dissipated a little mist in connection with the
Southern Consols. In the south end of the mine the
wash now exposed does not seem to be payable outside of
a narrow strip 200 ft. wide ; while in the north workings
about all that can be sworn to is the confidence of the
manager that the gold is hugging the western reef.
Speaking impersonally, it would be fair to say that there
is more chance of an average legal manager’s junior staff
hugging the type-writer than there is a certainty of pay-
able wash hugging any reef in a Victorian mine nowa-
days. In the bght of that fact, Manager Gross will be
commended if he looks to what is, rather than to what he
would like to believe is.

Mt. Bischoff (Tas.) on August 26 topped the
£2,000,000 dividend mark, thus putting itself in the
list of the world’s greatest mines. The Mount was
nearly ine nded in the Van Diemen’s Land Co.’s grant,
but the co. wouldn’t have such a barren block. Then
“ Philosopher ” Smith found it, and made the way easy
for lucky Launceston folk—Hart and men of that kidney
—to get rich easily. Ferdinand.Kayser still runs the
show, but Herman, once of the Victorian geological staff,
is easing the old man up a lot as his under-study. With
tin high, co. is now working only low-grade stuff, so it has
still a bit up its sleeve for that droughty day when tin
shall be back at £lOO or less.
* * * *
Mt. Lyell Co.’s grab of water rights on Blue
Tier (Tas.) has set part of the little island aflame. There’s
every chance of a political crisis over the matter, and
Premier Evans is crying “A plague on both your houses.”
He has the big co. on the one hand, with Luke Williams
to pilot it through the mazes, and, on the other, the
MaddOCks-Duff interests. A colleague also holds Blue
Tier ground, and seems to be in opposition to
the co., which looks like challenging him direct
before the Select Committee. If it does, look
out for a rumpus. The exact position is that Tas-
manians do not want to let the Mt. Lyell octopus
suck another district dry as it has the West Coast ;
but it wants money spent in opening up the Tier. If
Duff’s crowd put up £lO,OOO they would counter the co.,
as they hold the pick of the tin country; but they seem
slow off the financial mark. However, Duff is an
experienced campaigner, and his training in early
Lyell days will probably be a set-off against
the peculiar capacity of Luke Williams. Bowes
Kelly is in the happy position of winning either
way, though maybe he. would score most through
Duff winning, for, relatively, he has a bigger interest°in
Duff’s tin show than in the Lyell. Legally, the Lyell
crowd seems to have the best ‘of the deal! Still, it’s a
toss-up who will win, now that the issue is the fate of the
Evans Ministry.

From another East-Coast Tasmanian re the tin-
boom in those parts Admittedly some of the shows
mentioned by “East Coast Tasmanian” are wild-cats.
The Abbotsford, I agree, is no better than he said it was.
But as to others, including the Weldbrook, he is at sea.
True this show was sold at one time for £65 ; the pur-
chaser yesterday showed me documents in connec-
tion with same. But the Weldbrook then consisted
of 30 acres, while present co. holds 156 acres.
Old Weldbrook proper possessed 60 acres, from which
hundreds of tons of tin were raised, leaving it more than
half or three-parts worked out. This is high ground, and
runs right into centre of township, and was included in
the present co.’s leases, mainly to satisfy the insane desire
of the public in our days for large areas. Main part of
Weldbrook mine consists of alluvial flats running along
either side of the Weld river. These have practically
never been touched, being too deep, wet and flat for any
other than modern mining methods. Co. lias sunk holes
all along same, and tests (I have made them myself) show
tin right from grass roots. Main trouble in Weldboro’ is
water, or want of it. Plenty of good ground for sluicing;
but the Weld river, out of which Paul Northey’s co.
pumps its water, is too low for most of high stanniferous
ground around the township. Most of recent big floats
are legitimate concerns, intended to treat hitherto im-
possible g-round by modern mining plants ; but this water
question is the difficulty that many of them haven’t yet
grasped.

Margaret Thomas lost her voice whilst in Adelaide, and
Nellie Wilson dropped into her part in “The Country
Girl.” Then Nellie Wilson caught a chill, and had to omit
most of the music of the part. The management ap-
pointed itself a commission of inquiry, made the two’
ladies snuffle before it, and decided that Miss Wilson’s
cold was the worse, so Miss Thomas appeared on the-last
night of the piece. A motor ride is said to have been the
cause of all the voice trouble.
A lady, now in the Australian serio-comic profession, has
met disaster in the shape of marriage. A while ago
she met a man who is said to have told her he was some-
thing extra—an earl, a duke and a master plumber are
among the things mentioned. At all events they were
married, and, thereafter he stated that his allowance had
been delayed or something of the sort. Later it transpired
that he isn’t a duke, and isn’t legally entitled to wear an
. eye-glass and say “Haw,” and that he has never even
risen to be a .J.P. He is just common, stone-broke
“ Mister.” The lady’s legs, which were growing languid
in anticipation of possible retirement from the public
gaze, are now being shaken with extra vigor as there,
seems a possibility that they will have to earn a livelihood
for two. The course of blue blood never did run smooth.

has begun to talk; it has an ancient “ Theatre Royal”

that if it doesn’t forthwith haul the old monument down
and put up something new, the council will go into the

Remarks on Men’s Diseases
And Operations by the Freeman &
Wallace Stair of Physicians
and Surgeons.
There is no branch of medicine in which abso-
lute keenness of diagnosis and a thorough under-
standing of every detail of a case is so essential
as in the treatment of diseases of the Genito-
urinary Organs.
# * * * * *
It is now over 25 years since the Specialists of
the Freeman & Wallace Institute initiated their
particular speciality—Diseases in Men—and in
that time they have operated in Australia alone
on over 8000 cases of Varicocele and Rupture.
Many other operations they enumerate, those for
Stone in the Bladder, with or without crushing ;
operations for Cancerous and other diseases Of
the Organs ; removal of Stone in the Kidneys ;
Abscess with one or both Organs, removal of the
Nerve for persistent and incurable Neuralgia of
the Gland ; and many other difficult and dan-
gerous feats of Genito-Urinary Surgery.
Their treatment as regards Varicocele by Pain-
less, Non-cutting, Non-contracting and Bloodless
operation is generally approved of, and with that
end in view they have carefully collected and
tabulated statistics of operations of a large
number of operations of this nature.
They have been operating successfully for
Double and Single, simple and extremely compli-
cated cases of Varicocele, and can say with truth
they have seldom failed to cure a case however
bad or for how long a time it had existed.
They have operated on patients from the age
of six to the age of 84 years, in some cases where
the disease has existed for 40 years.
As a Medical Institute they challenge any Firm
in the world to show so large a number of cases,
or such an unbroken line of successes.

Bome Questions Asked.— For the benefit of
some patients who keep asking questions, the
Specialists wish to say that there is no cutting or
Blood Poisoning, and absolutely no pain.
The operation for Stricture or Varicocele never
injures the vital power: on the contrary, that
power is improved, wasting of parts stopped,
blood circulated through health}' channels, no
confinement in house or bed, and patient can
return home, even if distant one thousand miles,
on the following day. The result of the opera-
tion as performed by the Specialists is that the
moment the pressure of coagulated blood is
taken off the 01-gans the small veins enlarge,
regain their circulatory power, and healthy cir-
culation is assured. .
Hence new life, vigor, and strength in the
parts, after the operation for Varicocele, results.
Eight Frostatic & Bladder Facts
From Tabulated Records of
the Institute’s StafTs.
WHERE THE MEDICAL PROFESSION ERR.
1. Eighty per cent, of all cases of Enlargement
of the Prostrate Gland are not due to
Fibrous Enlargement, but to Congestive
Swelling.
2. Every case of Congestive Enlargement is
curable if properly treated by Specialists
in the disease.
3. —Cutting operations on the Prostate are never
called for in Congestive Enlargement,
but are always dangerous in old men.
4. In Chronic Hypertrophy, Urinary and Bladder
Disorders, symptoms are unchanged. The
symptoms increase and decrease according
to causes.
5. In sixty.eight per cent, of all cases of Con-
gestive Enlargement, and of Chronic
Inflammation of the Bladder (Cystitis),
there exists a stricture of large calibre,
causing reflex irritation and continuous
trouble.
6. —A stricture of large calibre is one that causes
many bad reflex symptoms, and is one
that is professionally known as “ not
tight,” as shown in the small stricture.
7. —A patient with an enlarged Prostate or Stric-
ture of large calibre may medicate him-
self, but will never be cured.
8. Nine doctors out of ten with little experience
class all enlargement of the Prostate
as Chronic Hypertrophy, and incurable
without operation. Thousands of patients
who might have been cured have thus
been sacrificed.
* * • *
TERMS.— The Specialists’ terms for consultation
by mail or in person is FREE, and
confidential. This does not include an
examination by the Physician-in-Chief
with the Urethroscope, Endescope, or
Oystoscope (or Illumination of the Blad-
der) when necessary. After a thorough
examination, they know exactly what
the trouble is, and can tall exactly what
is necessary to effect a permanent and
lasting cure. The Specialists know the
diseases of men like a child knows its
alphabet or the pages of an open book.
PAINLESS. —All examinations of any kind of a
minor degree are rendered bloodless,
painless, and free from complications by
the use of soothing medications known to
the Specialistic Staff.
Condensed Report of Operat'on
for Ulcer in Bladder.
Performed by Or, R. WALLACE and his Staff
upon Mr. H. C. •
(Surname furnished privately, if necessary).
This patient was a terrible sufferer, experienc-
ing all the inconveniences Inflammation of the
Bladder in its worst form would cause. Had been
to several doctors, receiving no relief.
Here is Dr. Wallace’s own extract
“I placed the patient on examination
table, noted following facts :
Bladder distended by urine, but no Stric-
ture. Prostate gland enlarged. Urine showed
Inflammation of Bladder and Congestion of
Kidneys, caused through stoppage, accom-
panied by agonising pain. Result of examin-
ation after searching for Stone with electric
Endescope. No stone and no gravel.
Lit up Urethral Canal, found it congested,
not diseased. Examined electrically after
washing out with clear salt solution. Every
fraction of the Mucus Membrane reflected in
mirror as plainly as if Bladder had been cut
open to the eye. Found on inner side of main
curve of Bladder Canal a small but deep ulcev.
This was the seat of trouble. Patient under
treatment seven weeks. Medicated applica-
tion to ulcer until it healed perfectly. Blad-
der and Prostate medicated. Later internal
remedies to regulate kidney action and
sterilise urine. Five years after received an
additional testimonial to one presented on
patient’s recovery to health.”
Extract from same

find my photograph. I think that is sufficient
testimony as to your skill and ability. lam

“ Vigilans” : Wyndham (W.A.) gaol has
now (July 15) only 22 nigger prisoners. This time
last year there were over 100 there. But you see
the 2s. sd. per day per nigger has been stopped,
hence the difference. Scandalous business this
nigger-hunting. Policemen have become rich at
the game. Hotel and storekeepers, likewise
squatters, are to be found all over the country
who were formerly in the force. A Chow has a
contract to supply the gaol with bread. He told
me that sometimes his bill amounted to £<V per
month. How this bleeding country has been
eaten up by policemen and gaolers.
“ Millewa ” on a matter of carnage
I was present at a rifle trial of a Western District (Vic.)
club a few days ago, and found procedure as follows. lne
length of the range being accurately ascertained by refer-
ence to surveyed lines, the rear sliding-sight is raised 2 7-8
degrees to get a parabolic curve on the bullet that win
drop it on the centre of the 12-foot target. A wet Anger
being held up in reverential silence to test the strength oi
the wind, it is, after various expressions of ignorance, de-
cided to get it by a trial shot. That shot is shot accord-
ingly. The whole troop then march down to see how tar
the inark is distant from the bull’s eye. Upon a consulta-
tion, it is held that certain decimals of a degree from the
centre.will be the just and proper allowance. The shoot-
ist takes out a beautifully-polished brass rule and a soapy
pencil' and makes an accurate and nulky line down the
sights. A space of 25 minutes occurs here while the marks-
men receive elaborate instructions on how to shoot, and
finally shoot a round each, and form up to march home
again. But modern warfare is so beastly sudden that the
enemy, when it makes a raid, will probably be inside the
lines stealing our defenders’ best soap-pencils before they
have the range and the windage more than half-defined.
First of all, Chief Justice Cooper, of
Queensland, complained that he had too much to
do, and said things about the Morgan Govern-
ment’s parsimony. Then Justice Real, with
characteristic sourness, followed suit. But the
public doesn’t believe that these men are so very
badly overworked. Every other branch of the
Queensland public service has to hustle m these
hard times without getting up in a public place
and telling the world all about it; and most ox
them have to hustle on much less than £zOUU a
year, with travelling al'owances up to £5 per day.
And other public servants don’t try to escape pay-
ment of their income-taxes by a High Gourt
appeal. There seems to be a desire on the
part of all classes in Bananaland to rush Kidston s
Treasury chest, because he managed to gather out
of the chaos left by his Tory predecessors a little
surplus. Looming up amidst the scramble is
Chief Justice Cooper, asking for another Judge to
be appointed, and Justice Real clamoring for the
return of a lost court flunkey.
“Tim” : A champion unlucky man is a
Victorian old-age pensioner I know. He started
life in London as a .clei k, saved up a couple of
hundred pounds, and went into business with a
Yankee, who, after involving the firm heavily in
debt, suddenly vanished with all the cash. Smith
then’ obtained a secretaryship, and was getting
along famously when consumption seized on his
family, and th : doctor advised him to emigrate to
Australia. He took passage in a sailing ship,
which went to pieces three days out, and left him
a beggar. Sailing as an assisted immigrant, he
was wrecked twice within three weeks, and it was
only at his fourth attempt that he and his family
reached the promised land. Fortune smiled tor a
time, but with the death of the eldest of his
family of 12, there came a run of trouble, and one
by one all his children were laid in early graves.
This so upset his wife that she went out of her
mind and committed suicide. Then Smith an
old man, homeless, destitute, and childless was
stricken blind. For some time he earned a crust
by hawking tea from door to door ; but ill-health
finally forced him to accept a pension. He is oO
years of age now.
There are some points that seem familiar
about the case of the American Senator, Mitchell,
who was convicted the other day in Oregon ot
accepting fees for doing work in the departments
at Washington. Mitchell is a lawyer, and has, or
had, a partner, and the firm did considerable land
business. Some of this land business got to be
known as “the Oregon land fraudsthere was a
row about it, whereupon Mitchell said it was his
firm that did the business, and not himself, lne
iury, after struggling hard with itself, found him
guilty, though; and when the last Frisco m..
left lie was awaiting sentence.

KIDNEY DISEASE,
Pertinent Points.
POINT 1. —You are more concerned in the
prevention of Kidney disease than in its dis-
covery ; where you discover it, the outlook is
very gloomy, the mere knowledge is enough
to appall the strongest.
POINT 2 . —We are particularly concerned in
the prevention and palliation of Kidney
disease, and you can enjoy the benefit of
Kutnow’s Powder or reject it. You are a
"perfectly free agent.
POINT 3. —The existence of Kidney disease in
the early stages is very difficult to determine,
and can only be successfully diagnosed by
means of microscopical and chemical examina-
tion of the urine.
POINT 4. —Simple derangement of the urinary
secretion is not evidence of Kidney disease,
but is clear evidence that the Kidneys and
bladder require to be flushed and antisepti-
cally cleansed.
POINT s. —Further evidence is indicated in
deposits or sediment, white or milky fluid,
pain in the region of the bladder, extending
into the bade, thighs, &c., with execretory
scalding sensation.
POINT 6.— The systematic use of Kutnow’s
Powder will increase the efficiency of the
kidneys, keep the bladder clean, and prevent
gravel and stone.
PJINT 7. —The main advantage of Kutnow’s
Powder is its entire freedom from sugar, an
essential point where Kidneys are concerned,
especially in Diabetes mellitus which is
characterised by the presence of sugar in the
urine.
POINT 8. —The last point is the best point. It
is a recognised fact in medical circles that
Kutnow’s Powder is the most efficient of all
uric acid Solvents and Eliminators, and in
this respect is a boon to suffering humanity;
it never fails to do good. Try it.
Important Questions
Do you value the health you possess, and do you wish to preserve it
in full manly strength and vigor ?
If you are unfortunately stricken with Kidney disease, are you
willing to try a comforting palliative ?
Would you, if suffering from derangement of the Liver, care to test a
certain remedy for it ?
Are you willing to try something which will improve your general
health and by no possibility do you harm ?
Is it your wish to eat well, digest well, feel well, work well, and
sleep well ?
Then get the grandest remedy in the world for Kidney trouble and
all Uric Acid diseases—which is undoubtedly Kutnow’s Powder.
The leading physicians of London, Paris, Berlin and New York have
tested the power of Kutnow’s Powder as a natural solvent and
eliminant of Uric Acid.
The result has been a veritable triumph for Kutnow’s Powder. They
not only prescribe it in their private and hospital practice, but
use it personally as a guard against serious disease.
IMPORTANT WARNING!
Kutnow’s Powder can be obtained at all respectable Chemists,
Medicine Vendors and Stores throughout the world. It is necessary,
however, that you discriminate between fraudulent imitations, which
are absolutely worthless, and the genuine Kutnow’s Powder. Do
not be deceived, therefore, by the general appearance of a bottle, but
bear in mind that to be genuine every bottle must have the fac-simile
signature, “ S. Ivutnow and Co., Ld.,” and the registered trade-mark,
‘‘ Hirschensprung, or Deer Leap,” on the carton and label on the
bottle. This signature and trade-mark should be seen in order to
obtain the

“Dear Sirs, —I consider it only fair to apprise
you of the remarkable beneficial results obtained
by the use of Kutnow’s Powder. I purchased a
bottle, and continued with a dose for several
mornings before breakfast. For a long time past
I suffered with severe mental depression, due to
an inactive liver and kidney trouble, with exces-
sive uric acid. Thanks to your efficient remedy,
I no longer fear these distressing attacks, as I find
a single dose corrects any mistakes in diet, and
removes the injurious poisons. In the hope that
my letter may lead others to try what has proved
an invaluable boon to me.—Yours truly,
“H. A. G. BOEDER.”

Nurse Cross writes—
“ 2, Percy-road, Wrexham, July 6, 1904.
“Sirs, —Thank you for Kutnow’s Powder, re-
ceived to-day. Some five years ago I had an acute
attack of nephritis (inflammation of the kidney),
and my doctor advised Harrogate waters. After
trying them for some time, with very little result,
the doctor suggested giving your Powder a trial,
with such excellent result that in a short time I
felt very much better. I continued taking it
regularly every other day for two years, and con-
sider it worked an entire cure, I still take it at
intervals whenever I feel a touch of the complaint,
and never go to a patient without a bottle in my
possession. Many of my patients have tried it,
with excellent results. I think the wonderful
good done in such cases should be widely known
for the benefit of other sufferers.
“ Yours sincerely,
“ MARGARET CROSS (Nurse).”

when you may Learn Free the
Secret of How to Grow Tail??
No Hatter How Short You Are or What
Your Age, You Can Increase
Your Height.
No new discovery has attracted more attention
in the scientific world than that made by K. Leo
Hinges, of Brighton, N.Y. Mr. Hinges, is to
short men and women what the great wizard,
Edison, is to electricity. He has gathered more
information relative to bone, muscle and smew
than any one else in existence. Making people
grow tall has been a hobby with Hr. Hinges for
years, and the results he has accomplished are
startling to a high degree. By his method every
man or woman not over 50 years of age can be
made to grow from two to five inches in height,
and any one older than that may increase Ins
height perceptibly. His method has the endorse-
ment of leading physicians, and several prominent,
educational institutions have adopted it for the.
better physical development of their pupils..
If you would like to increase your height you.
should read the book which tells how this re-
markable discovery was made and reveals to you.
the secrets how to grow tall. It is free. You are not.
asked to-spend a single cent, and if you desire it.
we will send you the statements of hundreds who*
have grown from two to five inohes in height by
following this method. The results are quickly
accomplished. Many have grown as much as
three inches in two months. There is no incon-
venience, no drugs or medicines, no operation.
Merely the application of a scientific principle in

QUESTIONS AND_ ANSWERS.
Q. I have been feeling very poorly lately, and have j ust been told by my doctor that lam Suffering'
from uric poisoning. I shall be glad if you will tell me just what uric poisoning means, is it a
serious matter ? . . . . -
A. Uric poisoning is caused by the retention m the blood of various substances which should
leave the body in solution. The retention of these substances is due to a diseased or inactive condition
of the kidneys. When the kidneys are working perfectly, they filter and extract from the blood of the
average individual about three pints of urine every day. In this quantity of urine should be dissolved
various waste material produced by the wear and tear of the tissues of the body. I his is dead matter,
and its presence in the blood is poisonous. The three pints of normal urine should contain about ten
grains in weight of uric acid, an ounce of urea, together with other animal and mineral matter varying
from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce; . - , ,
Q. Then I am to understand that the substances you mention when not eliminated from the body
in the natural manner constitute what is known as uric poisoning. What are the usual symptoms by-
which the presence of these poisons is manifested ?
A. Now you are asking a rather large question. Many complaints which are commonly called,
diseases are not actually diseases in themselves. For instance, Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago,.
Sciatica, Gravel, Stone and Bladder Troubles are all caused by uric poisons. Indigestion, Anaemia,.
Persistent Headache, and General Debility are often solely due to the same cause. In fact, if trie',
kidneys are doing their work freely and thoroughly, none of the complaints mentioned could trouble;
us, as the causative poisons would be absent. .
Q. I had no idea that so much depended upon the efficient action of the kidneys. I suppose than
when anyone is suffering from Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Sciatica, Gravel, Stone,
Bladder Troubles, Anaemia, Debility, Persistent Headache or Indigestion, the scientific method of
effecting a cure would be to directly treat the patient for the kidneys?
A. Exactly. In fact, that is the only way in which a radical and permanent cure can be effected.
The kidneys must be restored to health and activity, so that they may be enabled to remove the daily
production of poisons in the body, or the patient must continue to suffer.
Q. I have always been under the impression that the liver had a great deal to do with the main-
tenance of our general health, but it seems that the kidneys are the chief cause of most of the dis-
orders from which we suffer. _ ;
A. The work done by the liver is of the utmost importance, and it is closely associated with the
work done by the kidneys. Indeed, when anything is the matter with the liver the kidneys are
almost always directly affected, and the contrary is likewise true. In the liver various substances are
actually made from the blood. Two or three pounds of bile are thus made every day. The liver takes
sugar from the blood, converts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able again to supply it
to the blood, gradually, as the latter requires enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is
insoluble, into urea, which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with the blood corpuscles
which have lived their life and are useful no longer.
Q. As the functions of the kidneys and liver are so intimately related, I gather that if there is
reason to suspect that either organ is not doing its work ; efficiently, a curative agent should,‘be em-
ployed which would act equally upon the kidneys and liver ?
A. Yes, that is the. case, and it w-as the realisation of this important fact which led to the dis-
covery of that invaluable medicine, Warner’s Safe Cure. About thirty years ago, certain medical men,
knowing that if they could find a medicine which would beneficially affect alike the kidneys
and liver, they could control most of the common disorders, devoted themselves to the search
for such a remedy. After many disappointments, their efforts were rewarded, and | medicine
now known as Warner’s Safe Cure was proved to possess the required properties in the
fullest degree. Warner’s Safe Cure has a marvellously stimulating and healing effect upon
both the kidneys and liver, and by restoring those vital organs to‘health and activity, it necessarily
cures all disorders due to the retention in the blood of urinary and biliary poisons, such as Rheumatism,
Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Sciatica, Blood Disorders, Ansemia, Indigestion, Biliousness, Jaundice,
Gravel, Stone, Bladder Troubles, General Debility, and Sick Headache. Even Bright’s Disease,
probably the most fatal of all diseases, yields to treatment by Warner’s Safe Cure. Cures effected by
Warner’s Safe Cure are permanent simply because they are natural. [4
Thus “Raffaelo”:—
Have read a lot in The Bulletin about the diluted sort
of Australianism purveyed by the A.N.A. in Victoria.
That body should take lessons from its younger brother
in Westralia—the strongest national organisation west of
the Bight.. It pioneered the cause of Federation in the
drowsy wait-awhile days. The handful of Gropers, such
as Walter James, who fought for union while their fellow
Gropers damned the “ t’othersiders ” were those converted
by association with the A.N.A. The same body originated
the movement for the Jubilee Celebration of the Eureka
Stockade in the West—about the most refreshing demon-
stration since the worm of Himperial notions began to eat
into the body and soul of Australianism. When the
Hempiah men blathered of the flag, it was the members of
the A.N.A. who met them in every attack, and though for
a time the celebration seemed doomed to disaster, the
fight put up by voice and pen for Australian nationalism
eventually routed the alien-spirited opponents. Many
who knew the inanity of the'Victorian A.N.A. expected
to see the Westraiian body surrender before the
raging of the Jingoes, who shrieked hysterical accu-
sations of disloyalty, treason, and sedition; but
the Jingo voice screamed itself out at last, and
the Groperland A.N.A. was still there. When M‘Oay
and his semi-Premier proposed to import a further dozen
or so of military officers, it was the A.N.A. that tele-
graphed a strongly-framed protest in the name of Aus-
tralian self-reliance. At the recent annual conference the
delegates adopted as the main objectives of the Wes-
tralian branches the deliverance of the country from
pawn, the fostering of Australian manufactures, the
establishment of an Australian navy, with Australian
dock-yards, ordnance, small arms, and ammunition fac-
tories. At the same gathering they refused to support a
movement to assist the return of stranded Australians
from South Africa on the ground that the fools who left
their country to smash furniture and burn farms, so that
the way might be cleared for Cohen and the Chow, were
better left in the ruins they had created. If the A.N.A.
in Victoria forgets Australia in its eagerness to grovel, the
same cannot be said of the Westraiian section.
♦
The feebleness of Australia in 1905 is paralleled
by that of the 13 United States of America in 1789.
How, in the space of about a century, did the
U.S.A. come to be a Power whose goodwill is
courted by all European nations ? To quote a.
handy authority, note what is said in “ The Con-
queror ” (Gertrude Atherton), giving the life of
Alexander Hamilton, who was Washington’s
first Secretary of Treasury :
Hamilton (in 1789) had no, abstract or personal theories
regarding tariffs. . . . The situation was peculiar, and
required the application of strictly business methods to »
threatening and immediate emergency. Great Britain
was oppressing the country commercially by every
method her council could devise. Defensive legislation
was imperative. If the country was to compete with the
nations of the world, and grow in independent wealth,
particularly if it would provide internal resources against
another war, it must manufacture extensively, and its-
manufactures must be protected. Such, in brief, was the
argument of one of the ablest State papers of any coun-
try, for whose exhaustive details, the result of two years,
of study and comparison, of research into the commercial
conditions of every State in Europe, there is no space
here. It was opposed by the planters . . . who argued
that the measure would burden the people at large. That,
in the 20th century the U.S.A..would be an object of
uneasiness daily approaching terror in the eyes of
. . . Europe as ’ a result of this report, even Hamilton
did not foresee, much less the planters ; nor that it
would carry through the war of 1812 without financial
distress.
That is. a.bit of history with a clear application.

Aii old “ Lands item.” On May Bth, 1837,
John Terry Hughes, George Porter, Peter
M■intyre, John Bales, James White and Matthew
Goggs were, at Sydney Criminal Court, convicted
of conspiracy in preventing Crown lands from
being disposed of at a higher rate than the upset
price. The first four were sentenced to pay a fine
of £lOO each, which was very little considering the
thousands of acres the firm of Hughes and
Hosting annexed. Their names embellish the 66-
year-old maps of the whole of Eastern Australia,
now three distinct States. Hosking was first
Mayor of Sydney, but the firm over-speculated
and assigned to trustees in the early forties.
Hughes’ wife, a step-daughter of Sam Terry, was
extremely wealthy, and the husband’s bankruptcy
did not touch her estate. Even in those days, the
property was apt to be in the wife’s name.
“ J.A.C.” writes :
Few cities surpass Sydney in the Cult of Sweat, and
nowhere has it a stronger hold than in retail drapery
stores. I know of several flagrant instances, but one,
not by any means exceptional, will suffice. A very large
firm in this city employed a young lady of about 20 until
recently as a city traveller. She had to visit importers
and indent firms, and make purchases of trimmings, &c.,
and large sums of money, sometimes over £lOO, passed
through her hands. For these services she received
7s. 6d. a week. Many horribly good people are so much,
grieved that they have to lie down and take a long rest
when they hear of a young woman debasing herself by-
selling drink to dissolute man over a bar. Yet few barmaids,
get less than £1 per week and keep. However, my trust in.
human nature is not altogether shattered when I learn that,,
if it “sweats” its workers, the same firm is, in its turn,
being sweated by them—at least, by some of them. Ah
organised system of petty, robbery gees on daily. An.
accomplice of the assistant makes a small purchase, and,
after the “Sign, please,” has a parcel of many times the.
value made up. Another dodge is to save up the receipts,
which purchasers usually leave behind them on the coun-
ter, until an opportunity occurs of passing off the same,
amount of goods on a confederate. Of course, these
paltry pilferers generally strike disaster in the long run,
and then a shocked magistrate lectures them on the
enormity of betraying the trust of their good, kind
employer, and is sometimes too grieved and broken up to
give them the benefit of the First Offenders Act.
“Gr.H.”: Took a walk up Little Bourke-
street last Sunday afternoon. Encountered a
large brown flavor, for a start. Seven Chinamen
stood in a reverent attitude at the entrance to the
building from which the flavor was pouring.
Asked a policeman what the disturbance was. He
said that the Chows were burning incense to their
joss. Resolved that if ever I became a joss, and
anybody burned smells like that to me, someone
would get hurt. Walked on, and passed a fantan
shop. Fierce gusts of Chow profanity blew
through the keyhole. Ah Cow was beseeching
the bank to pay him his unlawful winnings, or
words to that effect. The bank refused, and Ah
Cow remarked, in a shrill yowl, that. the bank ;
was a viceroy, which is Chinese for an exceeding
great thief. The door flew open suddenly, and
Ah Cow landed in the gutter. The ehucker-
out said “Shoo-la!” and slammed the orifice.
Crossed Russell-street, and met a blue perfume.
Six Chows emerged simultaneously from a Chinese
cook-shop, bearing fragments of fried dog in their
hands. Clasped my nose, and rushed past the
odor. Met a missionary, with a yellow Brother
on each arm. The Brothers carried hymn-books,
and looked very devout. Passed a pak-a-pu shop
with a perfect hurricane of Chow argument raging
inside. Listened intently, and heard three violent
thuds. The blasphemy ceased, and the croupier
called out “Ke lahoa ? ” I knew it was the
croupier, because I had heard the same remark in
the ’pu shops in Goulhurn-street, Sydney. It
means “What number?” Heard more argument,
and more violent thuds. Walked on, and met Ah
Kim with his white wife and Seven mongrel chil-
dren. Passed three Chows engaged in a fierce
altercation about the price of cabbages. One
Chow brandished a bag of bananas, and acci-
dentally struck an altercating heathen compatriot
upon the pig-tail. The stricken one bit the
striker, and ran away screaming “Fire!” or
“Murder!” or thereabouts, in the Chow lingo.
Walked out into Spring-street then, and thought
how nice it would be if King Cole had his desire,
and all Australia became just like that.
The British House of Commons experienced
recently the greatest shock it has had since the
discovery of the Guy Fawkes plot. Prime
Minister Balfour had been meandering along,
strewing his speech, in the recognised House of
Commons manner, with bits of dead languages,
: when Labor member Crooks rose to ask for a
translation of “in pari materia," asserting that
he had never had time to learn Latin. It was
with the greatest difficulty that members of full
habit refrained from apoplectic fits, and Balfour
looked as if the blood of the Cecils was just about
to burst from his nose and pour on to his dispatch-
box. “By gad, sir,” gasped a stunned squire,
“ they’ll introduce payment of members next! ”

It proved a most effective remedy for a
severe attack of Bronchitis.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I lately had a severe
attack of Bronchitis, and, acting on the advice of a friend,
obtained a supply of your Bronchitis Cure. lam pleased
to inform you it has proved a most effective remedy,
causing me to feel grateful to you for furnishing such a
valuable medicine to the public. May you meet with the
success you so well deserve. I place this communica-

ASTHMA. ~
A Five Years case.
At times very bad indeed.
Quickly and completely Cured by Hearne’s
Bronchitis and Asthma Cure.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir,—For five or six years I was
troubled with asthma, at times very bad indeed. 1 was
very ill just after Christmas, so sent to the local chemist
for a bottle of your Bronchitis and Asthma Cure. I took
the first dose on going to bed, and was not troubled that
night. I finished the medicine, and have not had a
touch of the asthma since. I tell everyone about it.

HAY ASTHMA.
A Severe Attack Believed in Ten Minutes
by Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
The Effect was Wonderful.
Mr. W. G. Hearne Dear Sir,—About three weeks ago,
while in the vicinity of musty chaff, I gradually felt
a difficulty to breathe. My nose began to run, and to all
appearances I was developing a severe attack of Bron-
chitis or Asthma. At last I could stand it no longer. I
pen tried your Bronchitis Cure, and its effect was
t/onderful. In less than ten minutes I was all right
again. Such a result, and so quick, astounded me.
This is no exaggeration, I am pleased to say.—Yours
truly, S. H. MAYO, Meredith, Victoria.
BRONCHI fIS and ASTHMA.
A Sydney Resident Suffered for Over Sixty
Years. <t
So Bad He Dared Not Stir.
Relieved in a Few Minutes by Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
Would Give £5O for the Same Benefit rather
than Suffer.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Friend,—Chronic Bronchitis I had from'birth, and
I am now 66 years old. Some time back I contracted
Asthma, and for months I was so bad that any remedy
that had previously relieved smothering' was of no use to
me. I was so bad that I dared not stir, and spent the
worst night I ever had. When, in a conversation,'Mr,
Marsh, J.P., of Balmain, Sydney, kindly told me that a
friend of his was using your Bronchitis Cure, and that it
was good. So my sister bought me a bottle of it, and in
a few minutes after taking the first dose I could breathe a
little. The next day I was better, and kept getting: better
every day. To-day lam better than I have been for the
last seven years. I took the medicine as directed, six
bottles, and it cost me less than £l. I would give £5O for
the same benefit rather than suffer as I did. Please make
what use of this letter you think fit. If by so doing it
would only cause one to get rid of this fearful complaint.
—Yours faithfully,
WILLIAM CANHAM,
108 Curtis Road, Balmain, Sydney.
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
Its Efficacy in chest complaints testified to
by a Grateful Victorian.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in
adding my testimony in praise of your invaluable Bron-
chitis Cure. I have used it for the last three or four years,
and its efficacy I have fully proved in common colds,
severe colds, croupy coughs, and other similar chest com-
plaints. I have given it to infants a few weeks old, young
children and adults of all ages, and have never known it
to fail in relieving at once, and rapidly effecting a cure
with a few doses. I have recommended it to many of my
friends, and they have fully proved its wonderful curative
properties. I feel very grateful to you for a chest medi-
cine so valuable, and cheap enough to be available to any-
one. Trusting its present popularity and sales will be
doubled, I am, yours very gratefully,

An English Lady so ill that the
held out no hope.
Was given Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and it
effected a complete recovery.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir. —Not long since I had occasion
to visit the old country, and before leaving Melburne pur-
chased a bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, which I took
with me. When I arrived in Leeds I found that my n'ece,
Miss C. Matthews, was suffering from a very severe attack
of Bronchitis, in fact, she was so bad that the family doctor
held out no hope of her recovery. She was then given
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure according to the direction on
the label, and I am very pleased to say that it effected a
complete cure. R. J. MATTHEWS,

Sir, —I am thankful to say that the medicine you sent
for asthma has had a wonderful effect. I have not taken

BRONCHO-PNEUMONIA.
Two Severe Cases cured by One Bottle of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir,—Kindly forward without
delay another small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. The
bottle I had from you has cured two of my children, but I
do not feel safe without it in the house. I have also re-
commended it to my friends. I lost a fine little girl, three
years of age, from influenza and Broncho-Pneumonia. I
really believe if I had had your medicine my child would
not have died, for the other two, a boy five years old, and
a baby 8 months old, were suffering exactly in the same
way, and it acted like magic on them ; in fact, a small
bottleful cured both of them ; so trusting you will forward
it without delay—l am, yours most gratefully,
(Mrs.) E. D. WARD.

A Queensland Sufferer from Bronchitis.
Seventy-two years of age, weak and
"Wasted.
The Doctor considered it a hopeless case.
Cured by Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I beg leave to draw your
attention to a remarkable Cure of Bronchitis, which disease
attacked me last May. It was looked upon by the doctor
as a hopeless case. In such an extremity I naturally
looked about for something to try. I thought it a hard
thing, after 72 years’ experience of the ups and downs of
this life, to die in such an inglorious manner ; besides, I
was very poor in flesh, and thin, and this stimulated me
to make an effort for recovery, if only to improve my con-
dition. I saw your Bronchitis Cure advertised, and
thought I would give it a trial, so I sent to W. H. Harris,
chemist, Gill-street, Charters Towers, and got a small
bottle of it. I had scarcely finished it when I gave up all
thought of leaving my wife a widow, and hopefully looked
forwarded to many more delightful days of up and downs,
principally downs. The second small bottle caused the
Bronchitis and me to part company, greatly to its regret,
I opine. The third bottle stood me on my legs to receive
the congratulations of my friends.
1 have been a resident of Charters Towers for 30 years,
and, being gifted with the spirit of good fellowship! have
not the least objection to you making any use of this
testimonial you think proper, as a means of relieving
others similarly situated to myself.
JOHN SHEPHERD,
Queenton, Charters Towers, Queensland.
Relieved by one dose of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and cured by two bottles.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I wish to add my testimony
to the wonderful effect of your Bronchitis Cure. I
suffered for nine months, and the cough was so dis-
tressingly bad at nights, I was obliged to get up and sit
by; the fire. I had. medical advice, and tried other
remedies, without avail. I tried yours, and never had a,
fit of coughing after taking the first dose, and though 3
have had but two bottles, I feel I am a different man, and
the cough bas vanished. You may depend upon mj
making known the efficacy of your wonderful remedy to
anyone I see afflicted.—Yours faithfully,

“ OIOME four years ago,” says Mr. W.
Bell, of Hodgkinson-street, Charters
Towers, Q., “I was quarrying granite,
for channelling purposes, when a splinter of
steel flew off my hammer and struck the
knuckle of my middle Anger. I bandaged
the wound, and thought it would be all
right, but it began to swell and gave,
me much pain. It then showed signs of
festering, and I was told by several friends
that it was poisoned, and that I should
lose my finger, I tried various ointments
in the hope of healing the wound, but with
no success. I was advised to try Zam-
Buk, and I purchased a pot and applied it.
After a few days of this treatment I
noticed considerable improvement in the
wound, and ultimately it was perfectly
healed, and does not at the present time
give me the least trouble.”

The Silence of the Bush.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE’S that in our lone Bush, I know not
what,
Which genders silence; I’ve all that to
learn.
Here, there and everywhere, to loose the knot
That binds the sheaf-band of the taciturn ;
It may be where it freezes ; where ’tis hot,
Or streams lie silent in the nymph’s cool urn ;
In forest depths, or where the lone plain stretches
Sans other roof than sky, O’er heat-worn wretches.
Or ’mid the gully’s fern and sassafras,
Where all is cool green glooms and early dusk,
With silvern foliage in delicious mass
As, sunwards, feel their way, the spires of musk;
Or where those solemn branches crossing, pass
And wave o’er-head their pennon’d fragrant husk ;
Or by the river’s marge or broad gunbower
-With lily-pads a-swim and floating flower.
Here might one read the Silence of Fatigue,
And here again of Rest and Admiration.
Where gentle hands are clasped in wordless league,
And eyes meet eyes in eloquent oration,
Or fingers wreathed, accomplish mute intrigue,
Or tell by signs of ardent adoration,
Or past all these, ’neath burning rocks and bare,
The deep and death-like Silence of Despair.

Haimona and the One Girl.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THIS tells about the part of Hoadley’s life
which concerns Haimona. There was the
One Girl in the World waiting in England ;
Hoadley had only her letters and her photograph
in Maoriland, and that is not at all the same thing
if you come to think of it.
In the beginning the One Girl’s photograph
stood in a beaten brass frame on the shelf above
Hoadley’s bunk while he was at the tree-stumping.
But it came on the table always at meal times,
and helped him through his evening smoke.
These were the days when Hoadley worked like a
horse, and thought eternally of the time when he
would go back to England and marry the One
Girl.
Then he found Haimona. She was the only
clean and beautiful thing in the Maori pah, a mile
away on the coast, and she had eyes like deep
creek water running over brown moss. Hoadley
was starving for his kind about this time, for the
Government bush-fellers had gone before the
winter, and for three weeks he had only had a
weka to talk to.
Hoadley did not like the smells of the pah, and
he did not like the food. But he dearly loved the
long dusk evenings, when the old men and women
sat about on the grass and talked and smoked,
and the young girls played with the children
in and out of the raupo whares, until the mothers
caught their babies for the last time, spanked
them, and laid them in the mats ; and Haimona
came, breathless and laughing, to fling herself at
Hoadley’s feet and ask him questions about the
Big World.
One night Hoadley forgot to put the One Girl’s
photograph on the table until he had started his
pipe. Then he got up and stared at it through a
mist of smoke. It had only one expression. It
had looked at him just like that for nearly three
years. Haimona had as many expressions as the
sea along all the wild East Coast. Hoadley
caught himself up on that thought; stamped it
out, picked up the photograph, and kissed it.
But it gave no warm softness back as Haimona’s
mouth gave. This thought stuck as Hoadley
threshed in his blankets through the night. And
a certain vague shame kept him from - the pah for
three full days.
Haimona was grave when he saw her again, and
there: was a little line on her smooth forehead
to suggest that she had been thinking deeply.
“I am going to have my lips cut,” she told
Hoadley.
This is done, stroke by stroke, with a sharp pipi
shell, from the teeth to the outer red of the lip.
The blue dye is pressed into the raw flesh, and the
whole business is one to which no sane man would
submit himself. Hoadley knew. He had seen a
girl under the tattooer’s hands the week before.
“Good heavens!” he said, “What for,
Haimona ? ”
“It is the custom. A man will not take an
untattooed woman to wife.”
Hoadley caught his lip in his teeth. He was
sitting on a ledge of rock under the cliff, with his
legs swinging, and Haimona gathered kinas on
the sand. Her movements were lithe and free as
a sea-gull’s, and the muscles rippled on her brown
body where the sup struck.
“ Are you so eager to be married, Haimona?”
he asked.
She ripped three more of the spiny sea-eggs off
the rocks, swung up her flax-blanket, balanced it
on her hip, and came to him. But she did not
speak.
“It will hurt you—like Hell,” said Hoadley,
taking her face between his hands and looking
full into her eyes.
“ I know. That does not matter. It will make
you love me more.”
‘ ‘ My God ! Would you stand all that—brutality
for me ? ”
“Thereis nothing else in all the world,” she
said, simply.
And then Hoadley drew up her face to his own,
closely.
* * * *
He smoked five pipes outside his hut that night.
He was cold and unfed, and the two rooms behind
were level, black, and empty. But he needed all
his courage to take him in. He knocked out his
pipe at last, slipped it in his pocket, struck a
match and lit the slush-lamp. The untidy desola-
tion of the place gave no welcome under the
spluttering light. Hoadley shivered. He had
left a mother and half-a-dozen sisters in England,
and he was sick for a woman’s presence and care.
He stood the brass frame in the full light of the
slush-lamp, straddled a stool, and looked at it.
The One Girl was not particularly pretty; but
she had straight, trustful eyes, and a mouth that
brought two dimples when it smiled. The one on
the left cheek showed in the photograph, and
there was another on the curve of the bare shoul-
der. Hoadley looked at her steadily. He was
very fond of the One Girl, and he meant to go
back and marry her—when he could afford it.
But for what he was going to do now there was no
excuse, at all. He did not attempt to give one.'
He got up suddenly, wrapped his one sill: hand
kerchief round the frame, locked it in a little tin
box choked with odds and ends, and jerked the
key away into the middle of the felled scrub with
a fierce underhand swing. Then he went to bed,
and did not sleep at all.
The Maori has no marriage laws whatsoever,
but he chooses a woman and holds to her When
Hoadley chose Haimona there was some talk in
the pah because he was a white man. Then the
women laughed and shrugged their shoulders, say-
ing that it was Haimona’s business and quite time
to get the supper.
So it was that a double life began for Hoadley.
When the ’Frisco mail came in or went out he was
sulky for a day, and generally swore at Haimona.
But through all the other weeks he was happy
with a full-fed content. Haimona did the cooking,
kept the house tidy, planted and dug potatoes, and
helped Hoadley grub stumps. She saved him
expense in a thousand ways, and in the evenings
of the North that have no twilight she sang to
him, out on the edge of the bush or in the lighted
hut, all the old Maori songs that begin with hate
and war and end with love. And when Hoadley
laughed she pulled his ears and pouted until he
took her on his knee, and kissed her, and almost
forgot the photograph in the silk handkerchief in
the tin box.
It was after a year of this life that Terris came.
Terris had known Hoadley and the One Girl in
"England; and he took up some cleared Government
land next to Hoadley’s block and sent up his traps
before Hoadley knew anything about it.
Terris was puzzled for a full half-hour on the
first night that he came to Hoadley’s hut. Then
the two men walked the clearing outside and
smoked, while Haimona washed up the tea-
things.
“ You’ve got a jolly nice little bunk here,” said
Terris awkwardly, after ten silent minutes. “I
I never knew that it was all off with you in Eng-
land till I saw —this.”
Hoadley’s head sung as if someone had hit it.
“Mind your own business, curse you,” he said,
and then he remembered that Terris’ people lived
in India, and that Terris was not a letter-writing
man. After which he made apology and such
explanation as sent Terris away with the belief
that the One Girl in the World had thrown Hoad-
ley over and broken his heart. But it is not to be
thought that Hoadley told him all this.
Haimona made a good little hostess in her shy
stately fashion, and it became the habit of the
white men of the district to drop in at Hoadley’s
hut once a week. They brought Haimona lollies
and ribbons, and sometimes pictures, but Haimona
had eyes and ears and hands for no one on earth
but Hoadley. Terris grew angry on occasion when
Haimona refused to let him use Hoadley’s clothes-
brush, or tub in Hoadley’s big zinc bath. He
taught her to sing English songs, and she sang
them for Hoadley, in no wise understanding the
words. And if Hoadley clapped his hands, or
pulled her down into his chair and kissed her, she
walked in a pride that had no more words for
Terris that night. Terris wrote English verse for
her old Maori chants, and she sang them to his
banjo after eleven hours of harder work than
Hoadley ever did in liis life. And they were all
very very happy until one ’Frisco mail brought a
letter that sent Hoadley to tramp the bush all day
and come home at dusk, exhausted, and torn with
lawyer thorns.
Someone had left the One Girl a very great deal
of money, and she wanted Hoadley to come back
and share it with her. Hoadley read her letter
six times. Then he put it in his breast-pocket and
went in.
Haimona felt the change as he stooped for her
kiss. The line had lain between their lives
always; but only to-day had the One Girl’s hand
pulled it up into a barrier. She drew off from
him with grave eyes, not understanding, but
afraid. He answered, not knowing until the
words came out what he had meant to do.
“I am going away for a trip, Haimona. Just
for a while, you know. I can’t take you with me.
You must go back to the pah until—until I come
again.”
Hoadley never liked to remember the five days
following that. He took Haimona to the pah ;
and he came away, walking blindly, and call-
ing himself a brute. In the track he met
Terris, who asked startled questions. Hoadley
said something rude with intent, and Terris,
understanding in a flash, called him by such
names as men use when they take all the clothes
off their feelings. Then Hoadley hit him rather
hard, and went away, and took ship to England,
where the One Girl in the world met him on the
wharf.
* * * *
Hoadley had sloughed his shame before he
crossed the line ; and when the One Girl kissed
him he put Haimona and all that life on the
Poverty Bay coast very resolutely behind him.
It had nothing to do with the One Girl. He had
come back to marry her as he had promised.
It was after the three months of honeymoon
that the One Girl told Hoadley about her secret.
Hoadley hated secrets. He knew too much about
them ; and he questioned the One Girl rather
sharply. She was at the piano in their own
music-room in their very own house, and Hoadley
sat on the window-sill without, smoking a cigar.
The One Girl laughed a little, with her chin tilted
up.
“I only finished it to-day,” she said. “I
asked Mr. Terris to send me a Maori song for
you, and he did, and I have put it to Maori
music. I know it is a Maori air, for I took the
idea from that Maori band we heard in London.”
Hoadley would have grinned, but that his
mouth was dry. He had heard Haimona singing
in the pah, with twenty of her tribe to grunt the
burden. The One Girl could never make a Maori
air in a thousand years. “ Listen, then,” said the
One Girl, and began to play, and to sing the song
that Terris had written.
The long day drops through dawning into dusk,
With all the labor in the whares done ;
Mv spirit swells as full grain in the husk,
And has it no more worth, beloved one?
The clouds run northward through a windy sky;
They set to you as setting tide to shore ;
Far out behind the wind and tides am I
With empty heart that held you for the core.
The One Girl had found a tune with a kind of
wail in it, and Hoadley stood up, biting through
his cigar and staring down the sloping garden.
The tangi bids me bring my bitter tears—
I have no care for that Thing lying dumb ;
I hear your footsteps out across the years ;
They tread my heart, beloved, till you come.
The lifting of the light wave's as they pass—
The brush of careless flax-leaves in the wind —
I listen for your footsteps in the grass—
I seek
“ Oh, good God, don’t! ” cried Hoadley. Then
he flung away his cigar and came in through the
low window. “I beg your pardon, darling. It’s
a very pretty’ song. Thank you awfully.”
“But I haven’t finished,” said the One Girl,
sweeping out some big chords. “ Listen. I’ve
changed the air here. ”
The clean white sand shuts back the restless bay
(Your limbs are fairer, vet, white God of mine !)
But when the wet kelp shining on it lay—
Who said it was my brown skin laid lo thine?
The One Girl dropped her hands and leaned her
head back against Hoadley. “It was a white
man...and he went away and left her. Do you
understand, Dick ? I tried to make it like her cry-
ing.”
“ Where did you get the thing ? ” asked Hoadley,
speaking through his teeth.
The One Girl faced round stiffly.
“ I told you. Mr. Terris sent it. What is the
matter? Don’t you like it ? Why don’t you like it ?
You don’t know enough about music to know if
I’ve got the intervals wrong or —or anything. And
I’m certain I haven’t. Why don’t you like it,
then ? ”
“My darling, I—of course I like it. It’s just
dear of you to think of making it for me.”
“ I’m so glad,” said the One Girl, drawing his
head down. “ There’s another verse, you know,
only I didn’t put it in. It’s rather—well, I think
Mr. Terris might have left it out. Dick, do —do
men often do those sort of things ? ”
“ What sort of things ? ”
The One Girl’s cheek was hot against his own.
“Go away and leave her.”
“ I don’t know. Perhaps ! Some men are built
that way, you know.”
The One Girl shivered, snuggling up to him.
“Oh, my own boy ; what dreadful things there
are in the world ! ” she said softly. “ But it’s a
very pretty song, isn’t it? And I’m going to sing
it to you often and often, so you’ll never forget
what a clever little wife you have.”
“ Thank you, darling,” said Hoadley.

heart, or dropsy ? Is there too great or too little flow of the urine, with
gravel or sediment ? Do you feel always tired, done up, nervous ?
These symptoms, and many more, come from unfiltered blood—blood
loaded with impurities that are poisoning every organ.
If, then, you would “ get well/’ you must make the kidneys well.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are for the kidneys and
bladder only. They are a special kidney medicine (no ac-
tion on the bowels). They are nature’s greatest healing
medicine, because they heal the kidneys, the blood purifiers,
and help them in their great work.
Bead the following testimony from a Sydney
woman :
MOTHER AND CHILD CURED
Of Packache and Weak Kidneys*
Mrs. Louis Smorti, 1 Little Selwyn-street, Moore Park, this city, says :—“I can
give Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills a real good recommendation to all those who
suffer with weak kidneys. I have proved this medicine in the case of my little boy,
who had very weak kidneys. Every night he lay in discomfort in a wet bed, and
the secretions were very discolored. Indications showed that the kidneys were in a
very unhealthy condition. I heard of children having been cured of this complaint
by Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, but did not use them at first, I tried various other-
remedies. After a good many failures, a friend again strongly urged me to try
Doan’s Pills. I resolved that I would give them a trial, and am very pleased to be
able to tell you that they have wrought a permanent cure. Two boxes were
quite sufficient in his case, and he has been quite well for over a year now.
“ I might also mention that Doan’s Pills proved very good in my own case. I
suffered with backaches, headaches, and giddiness. Some days I could scarcely get
about my work. I used four boxes, and am quite cured—and cured permanently,
for over a year has passed and I have had no return of the ailment.”
Doan's Backache Kidney Pilts are
sold by all Chemists and Stz re-
keepers at 2s. 9d. per box (six boxes

To Queen Alexandr.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I SAW your picture in a lady’s paper ;
It was a most improper thing to do—
Oh ! please forgive me, dear Queen Alexan-
dra ;
I fell in love with you.
I know (the daily papers always tell me)
Millions of hearts, with loyal fires aglow.
Beat for thee, in the various little Britains—
And mine bumps, even so.
You never did (I’m certain, dear, you didn’t),
Or even think, a thing unkind, or shady,
So long you’ve been, God bless you for it all,
A quiet, married lady.
No other Queen could be so sweet as you, dear,
Not Cleopatra, nor the one at Troy,
If you but tried, you’d smite us all completely ;
Old buffer, man, and boy.
I dreamed one night (I had no pie for supper)
I saw you smile ; you nodded once or twice.
I was the king of some important kingdom,
And things were going nice.
My legions moved ; the earth was red with blood-
shed.
I saw my navies go, my navies come ;
I laid about me with big battleaxes—
In fact, I made things hum.
And lo ! I woke ; my tent door had been flapping,
’Twas bright moonshine. I had not waked too
soon ;
My dearest friends, they say I got a touch of
The big round summer moon.
Had I but spoken once, as I speak now, dear,
In your old home, out there beyond the sea,.
From what I hear of old-time ways and notions,
’Twould have gone hard with me.
Perchance, I had been taken to the Tower,
Or else the King, in a tremendous passion,
Had snicked my head off with a big, rough hatchet.
But that is out of fashion.
Kings now have altered all their little plans ;
i liey just go on like any other sinners ;
They smoke and smile, and sit and see the play.
And, sometimes, speak at dinners.
Sorrows have fallen on thee, deep and sore ;
We all must have our troubles in our time.
Just look at me ; I find it such a bother
To patch up this poor rhyme.
Time deal fairly with thy fair, sweet presence,
May Heath keep off his old cold, clammy hand,
may the Drought and Rabbit keep afar from
Ihy fair, green land.
May the good King grow jollier still, and fatter,
Much dreaded by his foes each glorious year;
Long may he smoke, and be a tine old fellow,
And drink good British beer.
M.L.

Axes.
[For The Bulletin.
I BET on the log-chop,” the one book-
maker reminds the public with monoto-
nous persistence. “I bet on the log-chop.
Two to one, Blane ; even money, Casey ; three to
one, Bill Kann ! ”
Casey, the champion axeman of Wallabballoo,
is favorite for the standing block—that is, with the
gambling fraternity, which doesn’t run to any
great numbers to-day. Blane’s awful handicap of
65 seconds on the two-foot block, puts him rather
outside the pale of the punters.
But Blane is the champion of Australia, and the
disinterested public “barrack” warmly for him,
whilst his own familiars, who believe that he can
give the whole population of Wallabballoo as much
start again and still have some to spare, turn out
their trousers’ pockets to the price of a beer and
stand by him.
A puffy, square man, whose red face is swollen
and apoplectic with the lung exercise, proceeds to
call the roll of the contestants and howl the rules
of the. tournament. His-voice ceases to trouble,
and there is a tense silence. The men shift un-
easily and examine their axe-blades. “ The Law,”
who is out for the day, takes up a good position
between the champion and the public, much to
the rage of short people, who shriek at him to
“ shift his carcase.”
The starter clears his throat. “Ready?” he
yaps, suddenly; “’cos ef yer not, damital, ver
ought to be. Go!”
Away in an isolated corner a small, drab-colored
man, who has been tremulously holding his axe
on the ready, starts to chip and nibble at his
block. No one heeds him ; he has never won a
chop in his life, and never will. But he turns
up always and everywhere, and swells the field
of starters.
The other men hold their axes in silent readi-
ness. The spectators hold their breath. The
hope of Wallabballoo—a nervous, red man, whose
fiery hair stands up rigid as wire in his excite-
ment-jumps nervously about, making frantic in-
voluntary motions at his block as each man starts.
“Fifty go!” yaps the starter. “Forty!
Thirty ! ”
The air is alive with sound, the resonant staccato
ring of the axes. Huge chips heap on the dusty
grass, and are rapidly scraped away by the sticks
of the zealous assistants.
“ Twenty go ! ”
The red man of Wallabballoo, with a magnificent
sweep of his arm and a grunt that startles the
populace,, “lets go” at his block, as though he
would cleave it in twain, and grinds his teeth in
an agony as the blade sticks fast. The hitherto-
silent public break into wild yells, and outside
backers jeer mercilessly. The seconds tick on,
and the champion’s assistant, an amiable giant,
grows nervous.
“Get ready, Gus, old man,” he implores. But
Gus is an iceberg of indifference, and watches
Casey with an appreciative grin. He stands
quietly waiting, the only one idle, listening to the
clamor of the axes. He seems absorbed in Casey,
who has freed his blade and is hacking out chips
in a way that collects a crowd around him.
“You’d think he went by steam to hear him
grunt,” he remarks to the giant.
“By the way he cuts too. Get ready, Gus.
Time’s near up. You’ll want all your time.”
Blane lifts his axe languidly and looks at the
blade.
“Scratch !” yells the starter, and the public
turns its eyes on the champion, and draws in its
breath with hisses of amazement at the great
strokes dealt by the powerful bronze arm and
shining blade.
* * * *
A wild yell bursts from the Wallabballoo crowd.
Casey has turned on his block.
“Go on, Gus! Hit harder!” almost sobs the
giant, poking an excited stick at a loosening
chip.
“Go on, Gus! Go on!” clamor his friends,
hysterically.
“/Tie’s goin’ like ’ell, Gus! Oh, hurry up!”
pants the giant again, looking over his shoulder
at Casey. “ He’s gettin’ through /”
Of a sudden a mighty spirit leaps into the
frame of the careless champion. His face is set
harder than the fossil-like wood he attacks, and
the block begins to melt as under the touch of a
magician. The giant stands by, watching the
deepening wound with greedy eyes, as though lie
wanted to eat the chips that clatter down.
Another deafening yell—Blane has turned.
“Good boy, Gus,” howl his friends. “Lord!
lie’s makin’ a hole in it. He’s catchin’Casey ! ”
“ He’s gettin’through, Gus,” warns the watchful
giant, “ but you’ll catch him.”
“ Who’s catchin’ him ? ’ hiss the excited specta-
tors. “ He’s all right.”
Blane’s friends hold their breath in a paroxysm
of fear, for his axe chips, and a spasm of suspense
grips their hearts.
“ It’s all up,” sobs a hopeless backer, “ Casey’s
near through. He won’t never catch him now.”
But Blane returns to his work with fresh fire,
and deals out blow's as from a Nasmyth hammer.
“ Casey ! Casey ! ” roar the Wallabballoo push
in a sudden burst of exultation.
“Blane ! Blane ! ” contradict the public. Blane’s
block creaks and heels over, and the crowd dis-
solves in yells. _ Casey’s axe slashes the air for the
last cut which is to make him a near second ; but
his axe-head suddenly leaves the handle and flies
through the watching crowd, marking its progress
by one man down. Before a fresh axe arrives the
second block is through, and the clamor of the
axe is still.
Casey’s friends condole with him—and them-
selves. Away in his corner the drab-colored man
ceases his nibble, game to the last. He hasn’t
even turned on his block, but he’s used to it.
Blane dons his coat nonchalantly. He looks fit
for ten more “chops,” and talks to a sea of
admiring little men and worshipping boys that
ebbs and flows about his feet.
“ Come along, now. I pay Blane,” cries the
booky spreading forth his hands with the sweet
smile of a public benefactor; and the champion’s
backers echo the smile.
WONGA.
Vitality.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE kiosk maiden and the phonograph
lady were discussing them when I hap-
pened along. So, of course, I chipped in.
The phonograph lady said she’d made three that
morning. Naturally I became inquisitive.
“ Three what ? ” I inquired casually.
“’Lectric belts, o’course,” she retorted. “Y’
better buy one. They give yer fatality.”
I courteously explained that I was the possessor
of a huge quantity of surplus vitality, so I thought
the belts would hardly suit my case.
“But they’re good for that, too,” she persisted.
“If y’ ain’t got enough fatality they give it to
ycr, an’ if yer got too much fatality they absorb it
out o’ yer ; so it don’t matter which way y’ are,
they reggerlate it fer yez.”
The kiosk maiden had scuttled back to cover.
As she had warm hair, I dug her out and advised
her to invest. She freezingly declined. Said she
reckoned her vitality was pretty accurate anyhow ;
so the phonograph lady got vexed with us.
Said she, “If yez a’ both got such boskin’
Vitality, it’s a pity yez don’t get spliced.”
The kiosk girl obliterated herself with amazing
velocity, and I became diplomatic.
“How much are you asking for the belts?” I
• asked, artlessly.
“Fifteen shillin’s, an’ye’d pay thirty fer ’em
anywhere else in the city. All y’ got t’ do is t’
stick the belt on, and the current leg’Jates the
vitality. I sell ’em t’ old blokes wots lost their
vitality, an’ young blokes wot’s got too much
vitality. ’S all done be ther ’lectricity.
“And where does the current come from?” I
asked.
“From th’ battery, o’ course.” This con-
temptuously.
“And where’s the battery?” I persisted.
The phonograph lady regarded me with grave
suspicion.
“I suppose,” she remarked at length, “that
you’re one of these ’ere ’lectrical blokes, so I may
as well give yez the stren’th of it. O’ course,
there ain’t really no battery, but 1 soaks ’em in
vinegar, and when the idiot that’s wearin’ one
gets a sweat up, it starts pricklin’ like mad; an’
’e kids ’imself ’e’s gettin’ a ’lectric shock.”
She turned suddenly to a youth with a specks-
before-the-eyes expression who was drifting casu-
ally by.
“ Buy a belt, sir ? It ’ll give yez vitality.” The
weedy youth propped short; and the phonograph
lady waded joyfuiiy in to re-invigorate him and
restore him to an admiring world as a standing
monument to the benetitsof a “ reg’lated vitality.”
SPINIFEX.
You can pretty well tell the sort of finance
policy a country is following by the size of its
Parliamentary refreshment-room bill. Back in
the drunken early ’nineties Queensland spent
thousands on its Parliamentary bar-room; lately
the figures have moved this way 1901, £1018;
1902, £921; 1903, £869 ; 1904, £B5O. In session
and out of session there used to be a liveried army
to fetch the member his turkey and iced asparagus ;
now one waitress suffices to serve the humble chop
and the sober pot of tea.
A few aphorisms :
Some people think that a man is not lit for office if he is
not officious.
D) not find fault with the earth ; you have no right to
expect ready-made articles to fit like those made to mea-
sure. This is a slop universe.
A man may look wise and yet not be entirely a fool.
While standing on the brink of manhood and woman-
hood no wonder youths turn giddy and fall in love. Some
people can’t stand brinks.
The great disadvantage of solitude is that you never
fully realise how many people you have the pleasure
of not knowing.
Charity sufiereth long because it is so cold.

A Blood-Purifier
Impure Blood. Abscesses. Now Strong and Robust.
m
m
m
Mrs. Annie
Snook, of Auck-
land, New Zealand,
sends us her photo-
graph, and says:
“I was a strong,
healthy woman
until about five
years ago. While
living in England,
on recovering from
an attack of the
measles, I took a
chi 11, had a relapse,
and came very near
dying. My blood
was left in a very
bad state. Ab-
scesses farmed on
my body. I was
confined to my bed
two-thirds of the
time, and at times
unable to move.
For two years I
failed to obtain any
relief, and was advised to come to New Zealand. On arriving here I con-
tinued about the same, trying many remedies without any relief. About a
year ago I thought I would try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. "Very soon the abscesses
began to heal, and my general health improved. I followed up the treatment,
until now lam as strong and robust as ever. I cannot too strongly recommend
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla as a blood-purifier and tonic.”
You will notice it was “Ayer’s ” Sarsaparilla that made this splendid cure
for Mrs. Snook. There are many other Sarsaparillas on the market, but
there is only one “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla. It is the old, original, genuine
Sarsaparilla. The Sarsaparilla that has been tested and tried for over sixty
years. Do not run the risk of trying some other kind.

Removes all Impurities from the Blood.
