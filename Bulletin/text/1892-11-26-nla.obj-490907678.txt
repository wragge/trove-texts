THE BEST
BEVERAGE
FOR
CHILDREN
Absolutely f ure.
CADBURY’S COCOA is closely allied to
milk in the large proportion of flesh-forming and
strength-sustaining elements that it contains. It is pre-
pared on the principle of excluding the superabundance
of fatty indigestible matter with which Cocoa abounds
—supplying a refined thin infusion of absolutely pure
Cocoa, exhilarating and refreshing, for Breakfast, Lun-
cheon, Tea or Supper, giving staying power and im-
parting new life and vigour to growing children, and
those of delicate constitutions.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BY PRICE WARUNG.
The ship Richmond, 512 tons, was, in the
Twenties, on her first voyage to Con victoria. She
had sailed under several flags, and seen much
vicissitude of service. She had carried a “Long
Tom ” during the American war of 1812, and the
interests of a pious firm of Bristol merchants, who
owned a share of her hull, had been so nobly
enriched by her privateering excursions that they
presented a painted window to a church “as a
slight acknowledgment of the goodness of Provi-
dence in blessing them ” at the expense of some of
those “ damned Yankees.” She had, later, also
in the interests of the Bristol firm—peace having
been declared—under the Stars and Stripes,
relieved an Arab slave-dhow of her living cargo,
and disembarked ’em on one of the West Indian
possessions of our Empire which, at that day,
were “ the most lustrous gems in her diadem,”
though to us of this generation they seem but
bloodstains on a map. Then, having served the
cause of an enlightened civilisation in the West,
she, by carrying a battalion of British infantry to
Calcutta, served it in the Golden East. And,
being by this time somewhat leaky and
largely rotten, she was considered worthy of
transporting, not Tommy Atkins to the scenes
where he could be shot down to the glory of God
and the profit of John Company, but convicts.
Tommy Atkins was too important an agent of
Christian cutthroatism for his life to be needlessly
risked, but convicts—well, if the Divine Wisdom
and an ignorant captain ordained that the ship
should never have reached Port Jackson, it is
difficult to say who would have been displeased.
Consequently, the Richmond, being in imminent
danger of condemnation as unseaworthy, was
selected by the Commissioners of Transports to
ta-ke out convicts to N.S.W. There was open
betting by the owner’s clerks as to whether she
would reach Rio.
• * »
She reached Rio, however, and sailed
thence with her water-casks refitted, and with no
more than seven desertions from her crew. Then
the trouble began.
Three days out, the pumps had to be set, and
kept going. The transports, who in any circum-
stances would have been compelled to assist at
the pumps, refused, after a day or two, to furnish
the quantum of workers. Two hundred of them
there were. The guard of soldiers numbered forty,
and the remainder of the crew, seventeen, of
whom three were sick. The officers of the ship,
and of the military, were seven, all told. Then
there were the Surgeon-superintendent, two ladies,
wives of the military officers, and three private
soldiers’ wives. Altogether, a company of two
hundred and seventy souls.
“ Doctor,” said Skipper Scrutton, at breakfast,
one morning, “I requisition a double shift from
the pris’ners for the pumps. My men’ll be
knocked up, what with the ship’s work and the
pumps. One shift a-watch of your fellows isn’t
enough.”
“ Very well,” answered Surgeon Billson. “ But
there is no occasion for alarm, is there?” he con-
tinued, as he observed anxious looks come upon
the faces of the ladies.
“No—none in the least!” the Captain
responded, with a satirical grunt that belied his
words. “ But we can’t be too careful, ma’am,” he
said to the subaltern’s wife, “We can’t afford to
run risks with a craft like this.”
Mrs. Giles strove to laugh off the fear she
evidently felt. “But, Mr. Scrutton, why did you
take command if you didn’t think the vessel safe?”
“ Eh, ma’am ? Why, a man who’s out of a ship,
through no fault of his own, and has younkers to
provide for, can’t pick and choose. He snaps at
the first hulk that offers, if she keeps afloat at
all.”
“ But, why should Government employ such a
vessel?”.
“ Arsk the Gov’ment, ma’am, why it permits
members of the Navy Board—the Board which
charters prison and transport ships—to own odd
sixty-fourths in the crafts they hire. Arsk it
that?”
“Do you mean to say ” broke in Captain
Conyers of the military guard. .
“I don’t mean to say nothin’more,” rejoined
Scrutton, who had received a warning kick from
the Surgeon-superintendent. “ P’r’aps I’ve said
too much. I aint goin’ to quarrel with my livin’,
though it’s only salt boss and hard tack on a
prison ship. An’, doctor, I’ll put those men on at
four bells, if you’ll order ’em up.”
* # #
“Those men,” therefore, were picked out
an hour afterwards. The prisoners were usually
sent on deck (in batches of twenty-five) for an
hour's exercise, but on this occasion there was no
alacrity to pass from the foetid prison to the gang-
ways. The men answered readily enough to their
names when the surgeon called them over at the
muster, but when he proceeded to order forty on
deck and not the customary score and a half, some
new feeling present among the prisoners expressed
itself in a tacit refusal to move.
“Now, then, move along smartly there!’’ex-
claimed the doctor. Up the hatch, my men ! ’
There was no movement, only a nervous rustle as
the men held their breaths.
“What, what’s all this? What, what’s the
trouble?” Billson, easy to get on with, was, like
most “ service trained ” officers, keenly susceptible
to any repudiation or denial of his authority, and
his voice hardened as he grew excited. He was
growing excited—that was evident. He doubled
his “what’s ” when he was losing self-control.
Still, no word.
“ Port messes, 10 to 30, starboard messes, 30 to
50, forward ! ”
The transports shuffled from between the slabs
which formed their mess tables, and stood ranged
in the narrower passageway.
“ Right—face ! ”
A gust of salt breeze came down the hatch, and
many of the fellows, clad only in duck trousers
and woollen shirts, and without socks or shoes,
shivered. Otherwise—no movement.
“What, what? Some more of this damned
stupidity ? O’Brien, what, what’s the meaning of
this?”
O’Brien, “first man ” in “ fifteen ” ones—“ Nos.
10 to 15 hammocks,” saluted, but spoke no word.
“ Damn—this is conspiracy—mutiny!” He
drew out his handkerchief to wipe his face, the pores
exuding the perspiration brewed by hot temper.
•‘Mess, port side, 35, starboard 50, stand out 1”
From the left and the right, the groups of five
moved out —saluted—waited for the command
they designed to disobey.
Billson had not made six voyages in transports
without learning his business. He was not going
to waste time in dealing with the men in lumps.
Bring each person, the individuality of each, to
the heel of authority, and deal with each, and you
get your grip on something gfaspable. You can’t
hold a mob in your hand. It is impersonal and
intangible. So—
“ Port mess 35.” He opened his muster-book
and read the names. “Cox!” The man saluted.
“Hutchinson !” The same respect was elicited.
“ Jones!’’
“ Denny j”
“Brooke!”
Each of the three answered.
“Stand out!”
“ Cox—disclose, instantly, the meaning of this.
What does all this nonsense signify? What,
what?”
The transport paled, but remained firm to the
common determination, whatever it was. He did
no more than repeat his salute.
“ Hutchinson !”
From Hutchinson, from Jones, from Denny,
from Brooke, no response was forthcoming. The
sullenness of the dumb brute apparently held them
all. Two minutes passed.
The Surgeon-Superintendent was gazing in his
wrath at the stubborn throng, and searching in
vain in his recollection fora similar case, when
the Skipper bent over the hatchway :
“Now, doctor, I’m waitin’for those pris’ners.
sent my fellows to breakfast, an’ water’s
coinin’.”
“Captain Scrtßton, send a sergeant guard here,
please !”
“What’s the matter?” Scrutton, prompt to
act, passed the word to Captain Conyers aft, and
then flung himself down the hatch.
“A conspiracy of some sort. They disobey
orders and none o’ them ’ll speak !”
“Eh, boys, that's bad !” exclaimed the skipper.
“ Think what ye’re doin’, lads. What’s wrong?”
Still the obstinate silence —broken only by
the jingle of the guards’ accoutrements and
muskets as they were halted by Conyers at the
edge of the hatch. Conyers glared into the semi-
darkness of the prison-hold, and, in his turn, re-
quested information as to the circumstances.
“Mutiny!” he said, when they had been ex-
explained. “ Mutiny—but this is no time for
mutiny, my lads ! We want help at the pumps,
else we may be water-logged, and have to take to
the boats !” He exaggerated the situation a little,
but he did what the Skipper and the Surgeon
could not do. He obtained a statement as to the
nature of the trouble.
“ That’s just it. But there’ll be no boats for
us ! Go back to Rio.”
It was a loud whisper; perhaps the speaker had
not intended the words to pass beyond his neigh-
bour in the transport ranks; but, whatever his
intention, it reached the ears of the officers, and
of the other transports.
“Who spoke?” demanded the Surgeon. But
he elicited no answer. Silence encompassed them
all again,
“ Order your men down, captain, please,” he
said, after a pause, to Conyers. “We shall want
them, I see!”
And at a word from the officer the soldier*
tramped down,
# # *
Taught by experience, in the insfcdiit that
followed the request for the guards, Billson and
Scrutton, carrying Conyers with them, stepped
backwards out of the prison. Inside, they Would
have been at the mercy of the transports; arid
their presence there would have prevented the
guard from tiring, except in the last extremity.
Outside the prison, even though the prisoners
rushed to the entrance and prevented the closing
of the iron-damped door, the revolters would, by
their numbers and impetuosity, choke the narroW
passage, and thus afford a protection to the officers
till the guards could use musket dr bayonet;
To the surprise of the Surgeon there was, how-
ever, no rush, and the ddor Was clanged td withoilfc
obstruction from the men. As before, the traiis-
ports were dumb and respectful in their demea-
nour, and when the soldiers had ranged themselvies
in three rows of four—no more than four musket
barrels could be forced into the “trap ’ Of tile
prison-door—there was no sound audible save the
wash of the waves against the sides, and half-
suppressed gaspings and bough digs from among
the convicts;
The position of affairs would have been ludi
crous, had it not been for the serious condition
of the ship. As it was, the Skipper and Conyers
were exchanging glances of amusetnbht at the
quandary in which the Surgeon fouhd hiriiself,
when the mate came to the hatch way and reported
to Scrutton that the water Was Ihcreasing alarm-
ingly in the well. The Skipper then asked the
Surgeon to make one more appeal for hands fdr
the pumps.
‘‘Tell 'em the whole truth, doctor! Thete’s
evidently some controlling mind there who is not
eager for extreme measures and will see the
reasonableness of the thing.” And the doctor
agreed. The heat of his irritation had subsided,
and he was arguing with himself as to whether,
after all, he would be justified in ordering a volley
to be fired when the mutiny was as yet only con-
structive and not actual. So he flung open the
trap and peered into the gloom of the prison.
“Men,” he said, “whoever spoke just now is
not altogether right. I see what the trouble is—
you’ve heard something of the condition of the
vessel. You think we can’t reach Sydney, and
you wish us to go back to Rio. You’re afraid if
we had trouble in mid-sea you would have no
chance of getting at the boats ”
He paused, as though to secure a confirmation or
denial of his remark ; but neither came. The men
held themselves in the bonds of their agreement,
whatever it was.
“Now, men,” he went on with something more
of temper in his speech, “ I don’t wish to treat
you as mutineers, or as children, but as reasonable
beings. We can’t go back to Rio—my duty and
that of Captain Scrutton is to take you direct to
Sydney. And you’ve seen enough of me by
this time to know I’m a man of my
word. What I say I’ll do. And I say
now, if we have to take to the boats, I’ll be the
last man to leave the ship. If there are not boats
enough for us all, and some have to stay behind,
I’ll be one. Isn’t that fair ? ”
His tones were honest, and carried conviction,
except to those second voyage fellows who by
some hideous experience or other had been ren-
dered impenetrable to belief in the straight-
any official of the System. And,

though there was no articulate response to his
words, a sudden murmur that might have become
articulate had it not been instantly checked, arose
from the rear of the prison.
“What, what, isn’t that fair, I say ? There are
some second-trip men among you, and though
none have travelled with me before, I ask them
have they ever found a fairer man? You ask
them, you others, have they ? ”
Still, the curious, absurd but dangerous silence.
“Have I ever played into the hands of the
owners’ Did I ever profit by ‘eights ’?;• Did 1
keep my men on short rations, or short clothes,,
and sell surplus stock ? Did I ever stint veget-
ables and lime-juice ? Haven’t I had many a row
with the skippers over letting so many prisoners
go without irons early in the voyage ? You know
it is as I say, that I’ve always been fair ”
“ He hanged a pris’ner at the yard-arm once.”
A whisper, like the first.
“Yes, I did! What, what if I did? And
another time I shot a man just a prison-trip like
this. I punished them to save other fools from
treading in their footsteps. And I’d punish your
leaders, too, if I knew who they were ”
He was interrupted by jeering laughter, though
the transports still held back their speech.
« * *
Nevertheless, as there is a laughter which
is more eloquent than speech, they had spoken
when they laughed into the practised ear of
Surgeon Billson. The laughter told him that they
had resolved among themselves to maintain
silence, so that no evidence of leadership should be
produceable against one or two or three of their
number.
The blood-penned chronology of the System
included countless dates when the spokesmen of
convict parties had been treated as ringleaders.
The jeering chorus was so many words to say,
“Not one of us, nor two, nor three shall be held
responsible for this outbreak of constructive
mutiny, but, if any, all.”
“That’s it, is it?” cried Billson, “I see now!
You’ve got some old lag, some second or third
tripper ainong you who is a gallows-lawyer, and
he has put you up to keeping your mouths shut,
so I shan’t know your leaders. But that won’t
go down with me, lads—not for a second.
Now,” —he took out his watch—“ Captain Conyers,
what time do you make it?”
Conyers made it 11.5 ; the doctor’s lever made
it 11.7. “I’ll go by your watch, Captain,” Billson
resumed. “They’ll have two minutes longer,tp
think of it.” He paused.
There was a rustle of expectation in the prison,
and a talking as though the men were drawing near,
the trap to hear his ultimatum. The doctor,
noticed the movement; and to emphasise the
effect of his next words, drawled them with slow,
precision.
“Take—notice —that—at —the —hour —of—noon
—by Captain Conyers’ watch —I shall —un-
less—”
He held them in suspense. He was experiment-
ing upon their nerves, and trusted that some of
the weaker would give way under the stress and
break forth into reviling. That was what hp
wanted. He did not care who it was so long as
he could formally charge somebody with the
serious offence of turbulent and rebellious speech.
Having the somebody, he would tjien, seize him
as ringleader and inciter to the mutiny, and
the issue would be simple whether he had been
fortunate enough to capture the right man or
not. If the right one, punishment would be in-
flicted upon the deserving; if the wrong one, he
knew sufficient of the convict nature to understand
that the mass would be unwilling to let the inno-
cent suffer. And so he held the prisoners on
tenter hooks. No sudden cry, however, fell from
the convict throng, though the stress and strain
was intense. What did he mean to do?
“ Unless . Ah, Mrs. Giles, come to see
what we are about?” He broke off to exchange a
few remarks with the ladies, who; made anxious
by the delay in tffe re-appearance of Captain
Conyers, had walked forward. Minutes passed
before he resumed. Still the men rejected the
temptation to exclaim. Whoever their leaders
were, the transports had been trained to unusual
self-control.
“Unless—at twelve o’clock 1 say—you men do
one of two things : tell off a working-party, for
the pumps, or give up your leaders—l shall fire—
a volley—into your midst. Captain Conyers—the
time again, please.”
“ Thirteen minutes past eleven !”
The Surgeon and Scrutton went on deck.
* * #
Conyers stayed at the mouth of the prison
with his guard. In a few minutes, however, he
was relieved, his subaltern, Giles, coming down
with a message from the Surgeon-Superintendent,,
requiring his presence on, deck. But in a little
while, and apparently as a result of; the confer-
ence, he re-appeared at the hatch, and ordered the
guard on deck.. As the soldiers mounted and.
lined up, the Captain, with a- slow distinctness of
voice, which reached the prisoners grouped nearest
the trap in.the prison-door, ordered them-to draw
their charges. The prisoners, intent upon, de-
velopments, at this- lost for a moment their
self-control. They were at no loss to under-
stand why the charges should be withdrawn-
just when it was expected- that a deadly
volley would be requisitioned. It did not
signify a change in. the Surgeon’s policy—it
simply meant a. new precaution. The soldiers
had loaded, their muskets, perhaps two,, perhaps
three days,ago ; and when it came to the pulling
of the trigger, there might, be no certainty of. dis-
charge. A, new charge meant,—business.
This the transports knew. The second and
third trippers,amongthem advised the “raw’uns”
on the point. Apd : the “ raw ’uns ” grew cowed,
and would have given ip, but for the graduates in
the lore of the lag. These —half-a-dozen or, so-
swayed the rest of the two hundred. They trusted
tp their lpck, It, was. quite unlikely, wasn’t it,
that having survived the System so far, they
would suQcumb to the bullets of a ship’s company]?
No ; the bullets would find billets assuredly in the
bodies of the first And after the volley
was fired, the fear,of comment and publicity which,
since there had-beena free press in Sydney, invari-
ably weighed upon the official mind afloat, would
produce a reaction, and the skipper, and the
surgeon would take the vessel back to Rio after,
all, And then, hey, ho ! fpr escape!* This was
the old lags’game planned from the first, as, soon
as they had heard frpm the cony.ict steward, who
had heard.the conversation, at, the cabin-table* as-
to the ship’s, condition. “ Wje’ll give ’em a
workin’-party to Rio an’ now’ere else !” said one
of the oldsters to a raw ’un, who ventured to
suggest a compliance with the surgeon’s demands.
“ An’we’ll keep our jaws tight till they consent
to take us back.”
“Why not tell ’em so, then,” said the “raw
un,” “ before they fire?”
“Who’s to tell them? If we all shout it—
they’ll say they ’erd some one voice distineter
than the rest, an’ they’ll ’av that chap out as
ringleader. An’ they can ’ang a cove for mutiny
in Rio as well as in tfa’ ol’ town. No —they can’t
’ang two ’undred of us any’veres. But they can
’ang one or two ’ere it pleases ’em.”
And so the oldsters had their way. Experience
has a more servile following among the evil than
among the good. Which, being a patent and
read-as-you-run truth, has never yet been appre-
hended by the intellect of the administrators of
British penal systems.
» # #
At eight bells the guards were re-marched
to the hatch, and Conyers addressed them in a few
words that were plainly audible to the prisoners.
“ Men,” he said, “you may have an unpleasant
duty before yon, but you will do it, I doubt not,
as you have performed duties where there, to your-
selves, were greater risks. I would, for your sake
and mine, that we ran no- risks now —I don’t like
to shoot men down in cold blood,, but that is our
duty now. We must have labour for the pumps;
and: if we had not that pressing need we cannot
allow these prisoners to defy discipline.” Ho
paused before he concluded. And the heads of a*
dozen, men, pressed close against the bars of the
trap.in the prison- dbor, shivered with-an involun-
tary creeping of the skin as his last words rang,
out—
“ With ball-cartridge—load ! ”
©f course the men inside the trap could not see
the broad smiles that spread over the faces of the
guard,
* *
The guard:, led by Conyers and the Surgeon,
descended. Dr. Billson, after a second’s delay,
spoke to the transports.
“Will you give up your leaders—or send out a-
working-party and obey orders ? Which ? ”
Again—only the silence for his-answer !
“ For the second time I- ask you—which ? The
third time, if you refuse, I shall fire ! ”
And, still he was mocked by. the strenuous dumb-
ness.
“For the third and last time—which will you-
do?”
“No answer? Then—Captain Conyers; pur-
suant to my instructions; I ask you to do your
duty ! ”
The dbctor dtew back a-step, and Conyers took
his place by. the trap.
“ Prisoners—think,!' Will you obey the doctor’s-
orders ? ”
He waited, while you could' have counted 1 ten.-
Then—
“ Guard, by sections of four—advance-fire
retire —and re-load.” The first section advanced'
and, dropped their muskets.
“ Men —once more ”
“No?” Conyers went on.- “Then, guards,-
through the bars. Ready ! ”
He drew-back; the soldiers - rested'the rims of
their barrels on the ledge of the trap— a barrel to ■
every aperture in the barred trap.- There was no
need to aim.
“Ready! Fire!”
* *' *•
But before the second' syllable of the 1
“ Ready ’’ had merged into the terrible word, andf
while the prisoners had rushed to the sides of theif
hold, as though they could escape from the im-
pending volley, one voice, at least, was heard
from atr.ong them.
“You —— butchers ! If you will shoot, shoot
me ! ” And the broad back of one of the greatest-
scoundrels of the lot was thrust against the trap—
and the rims. But too late to avoid the “Fire !”
# # «
The gory spectacle that Bill Eastwood
presented to the horrified “raw” prisoners, was'
an object-lesson in the System’s discipline. And
Bill Eastwood, on his third voyage out, being
unable longer to preserve with menace or coax-
ing,, his moral sway over the mass, the pumps got
their working-party, andjthe ship, after a seven-
months’ voyage, duly reached Sydney.
Had the guard really loaded with ball, there
would, of course, have been no necessity to' amend*
Bill’s “ marks/’ As it Was, having loaded only
with blank cartridge, the wadding and flame of
the muskets left him, not with life only, but'with 1
certain sears that appeared iii: the records for'
many long years after - or didn’t appear, accord-
ing, as to whether the record-clerk was lazy or
industrious. Bits of wadding and fibres of woof
came out of Bill at intervals, for some months.-
When he left the Richmond' for the hospital, atr
Sydney, Surgeon-Superintendent Billson read to 1
him his amended description :
1 ‘ Height, S' feet inches ;■ complexion, tudd'y ;-
hair, sandy brown; mixed with grey eyes, blue ;-
general- remarks, sandy whiskers*; eyebrows light,'
hands hairy, tattooed anchor and meifibaid, slight
scar on back of forefinger of left hartd,- scar oh
ball of left thumb. That’s the Old lot, Eastwbod 1
Now for the new ” -
“Aye, -aye, let’s-ha’ ’em too. I’ll know myself ! ,v
growled Bill.
“Back, greatly scarred from wadding, fired at
point-blank.”
“ By a butcher of a- sawbones,” said Bill.
Dr. Billson laughed', as he could afford to do;;
having quelled a-dangerous and singular mutiny
at no more expense than the four blank cartridges-
and Bill Eastwood’s scarred back.

Dr. Kelly’s reputation is so thoroughly established that it will only oe necessary for him to intimate
that he is practising as a Specialist, to be appreciated as a benefactor to suffering mankind. As the
greater portion of the New South Wales public is aware, Dr. Kelly is a Legally Qualified and Registered
Physician, and has by far the largest practice in the colonies. Many persons at a distance, however, are
unaware of his great success, as, hitherto, he has refrained from advertising. Hence, to widen the
sphere of his usefulness, he has determined, by means of advertising, to make himself known in remote
districts, where his reputation may not yet have travelled. As the question may arise, why does so
eminent a Physician as Dr. Kelly find it necessary to advertise, he may reply to one and all as
follows:—That the Physician who has the power to dure, and remains silent, is guilty of an un-
pardonable sin of omission; for if there is a person on earth to be pitied, it is he "'ho is obliged to
associate with his fellow beings while his mind is constantly harassed and tortured

The Apostate in Ermine.
Sir Samuel Griffith has made his farewell
to las Australian political life, and retires to
the safe asylum of a Chief Justiceship, with
£3500 a year, and travelling expenses, and
a prospective pension. There are people
who will envy him. The Bulletin would
as soon think of envying the leper who last
week carried his living corpse to the lazaret.
The leper has consolations that are denied
to the political apostate of Sir Samuel
Griffith’s stamp. The merciful tenderness
of Nature numbs the faculties as the blood
grows foul, and the plague-smitten wretch
bears stolidly his hideous burden along the
road that leads to the final oblivion, without
ever knowing the full horror of the thing that
has come upon him. But there is no such
anodyne for the other. He must rob, and
shudder as he rots. So we pity him.
# # *
There was a day when the name of Samuel
Walker Griffith stood for big possibilities.
How far he would go no one could tell.
Without any burning enthusiasm for human-
ity, he had still the clear, cold intelligence
that sees far ; he had the scientist’s pulseless
passion for mathematical regularity and
appointed order. Not with boiling iudigna-
tion at the wrongs of the toiler groaning
under the yoke of Christian civilisation, but
with the deliberate precision of a botanist
classifying and arranging the specimens that
some child has jumbled, he set himself to
disentangle the knotted threads of our social
order. Ho might, one day, have been the
brain of a great movement that would stir
humanity to its base—the thinking-machine,
controlling and regulating and directing the
forces of whole armies of strong limbs and
beating hearts. In this sense he might have
looked to be a leader of n.en. That was his
dream. Pie looked into the future, aud saw
a federated Australia grappling in the might
of its lusty youth with the monsters before
which the old, grey nations cower appalled,
reading the riddles of the Sphinx, andshouting
the good tidings of a new hope to the weary,
toilworn masses in the lauds across the sea ;
and high above it all, in the seat of honour
and of pride, he saw—it doesn’t matter now
what he saw. Samuel Walker Griffith,
the apostate, has tumbled down to the bench
<>f a provincial law-court. And we pity him.
* # *
This man's unhappy career is a warning to
those who know not how to wait. Griffith
saw the evils of laud-monopoly and chartered
privilege, and years ago he fought strenu-
ously to defeat, and did defeat, the land-
grab railway swindle promoted by M‘ll-
wraith and Co. It was a voice crying in
the wilderness against the alienation of
Crown lands before the Single-tax league
had cut its first teeth. With a clear fore-
sight of all that the Kanaka slave-trade
meant —that it was putting in the hands of
the nigger-driver of to-day a new lash for
the back of the white slave of to-morrow —
he led a victorious crusade with the watch-
word, “Australia for the white man 1” It
was decreed that the Kanaka slave-trade must
stop. Then he turned his eyes to the white
slave-trade. “Freedom of contract!” he
cried scornfully. “There is no such thing
between employer and employed. The
weaker party is driven to accept the terms
which the stronger party chooses to give.
Why should the labourer not share in the
profits that the capitalist now seizes ? Why,
rather, should he not have them all ? ” That
was the Samuel Walker Griffith of 1888.
And he looked to see the labouring masses
honour him as a god. But they turned away
and worshipped at other shrines. If he had
waited, some day he would have got his
reward for the things he did. But he could
not wait; his heart turned to gall and bitter-
ness, and he wheeled round savagely and
undid it all. Freedom of contract! he drove
it in at the point of the bayonet. The
Kanaka slave-trade ! he opened wide the
flood-gates and let the black tide in.
Land - alienation ! he handed Queens-
land over to the tender mercies of
the dummyist. Land-grab railways ! he
forced them on a protesting country with a
brigade of dumb, servile votes in Parliament
and the inexorable gag. Then, with all the
work of his life in ruins, he turned his back
on the smouldering wreck, and slunk away
with his thirty pieces of silver in his rene-
gade apostate hand. His Honor Sir Samuel
Griffith has £3600 a year ; but his Honor
Sir Samuel Griffith has also a ghost that
will never leave him asleep or awake —the
phantom of what he was, of what he might
have been. So let us pity him,
* # #
Life has many things in store for the man
of Griffith’s talents. They are qualities
that bring a big price in the market where
their owner goes a-huckstering. Sir Samuel
may yet change his knighthood for a peerage.
Hands like his will find it not impossible to
shape the judicial bench into a ladder to the
Privy Council and the House of Lords. He
need not want for gauds to. blazon his dis-
honour. But the Dead Sea fruit is dust and
ashes, gild it how you will. Even if he carry
the dregs of his spoilt life to the woolsack,
he can never hope again to share even the
leper’s untroubled content, unless, indeed,
the future holds for him the leper’s boon of
dulled sensibility and poppied forgetfulness.
We have no tribute for him now but pity—a
pity that the tragic squalor of his fallen for-
tunes makes too mournful for contempt.
The Biggest Land-Grab on Earth.
As we go to press the Queensland Legis-
lature, on the invitation of the Criffil-
wraith Cabinet, has given its cordial assent to,
the construction of no less than eleven land-
grant railways in one stupendous job. This
will probably be the last act of the worn-
out Parliament. The difficulties in the way of
this mammoth grab have been very great,
but, so far as appearances go, they have all
been surmounted. The country has twice de-
clared emphatically against the land-grant
system, and both MTlwraith and Griffith
got into power chiefly because they pledged
their non-existent honour and their bloated
reputations never to touch or handle or encourage
or be in any way accessory to the unclean finan-
cial thing. The great majority—probably 75
per cent. —of the present Assembly took the
same pledge. The Parliament, by its own vote,
was dead two years ago ; it has passed an Act
whereby the duration of Parliaments is limited
to three years, yet it has now been almost five
years in existence ; therefore, the very fact that
it exists at all is an act of gross and shameless
treachery. The only way to complete the fraud
is to crowd the eleven railway agreements
through in red-hot haste in the fag-end of
the last session, before the House becomes
extinct in law as well as in equity, and a new
Assembly arises to repudiate the land-grant
brigands and all their works. Also, the two
chief traitors —the one with the haggard, con-
sumptive eye, and the adipose man with the
stertorous breath are, to all appearance)
slowly dying like the Legislature which
supports them. But none of these difficulties
have been sufficient to block the way. The
Coalition leaders have shamelessly apostatised.
The Parliament has apostatised likewise almost
as one man, and there is good reason to suspect
that most of the renegades are in the land-grab,
in one shape or another —some of them in many
shapes. The majority has decided to cheerfully
ignore the fact that their House is practically
dead by its own act. And even if the great
job is only shunted through five minutes
before the Legislature dies, there seems very
little reason to doubt that it will be shunted
through all the same,
* m m
The business of the session is practically
this ; (1) To bind the province to the con-
struction of II railways, many of which cannot
be built for over 20 years to come. (2) To make
a cast-iron agreement whereby the syndicates
which construct these railroads shall receive the
full value of their lines on an inflated
estimate made practically by themselves —in
land, which land may be rated as low as 2s. 6d.
per acre, being, perhaps, one-eighth its value ;
and at the same time shall have the sole use of
the lines for ten years, at the end of which
period the shoddy and partially worn out pro-
perty shall be sold to the State at its full, or
more than its full, price as a new article. In
other words, the company which builds a rail-
way worth £1,000,000 may get land to the
nominal value of £1,000,000, but probably,
including minerals, to the real value of
£8,000,000 or more—and will also own the rail-
way, with power to sell it when the rails are
getting worn out and the plant rusty, to the
State for another £1,000,000 or upwards,
whereby the country will get its own
£1,000,000 worth of line for something like
£9,000,000. There are one or two alternative
systems, one of which is, so far as can be ascer-
tained from the confused and badly-drafted
bill, that the country may take over its railway
without any cash payment, provided it gives
the company twice its nominal value in land—
which may mean about sixteen times its real
value—and allows the company to monopolise
the line for fifty years; but they all amount to
the same steal in the end. (3) To ratify another
cast-iron agreement whereby the State pays for
all surveys, thus relieving the syndicates of a
preliminary expense of about £250,000. This
is an extensive programme for a short session—
fifty years of hard, unblushing fraud and con-
fiscation crowded into something like four
weeks, but the prospects of defeating the
measure are apparently nil. The only thing
which remains to be done is the final ratifica-
tion of the agreements with the syndicates, and
if the agreements can only be got ready in time
a special session of Parham nt will put them
through in short order.
# # #
The syndicators who will profitby this swindle
are mostly South Queensland financiers ; the one
or two hundred million acres of rich mineral and
agricultural land —probably among the richest
in Australia—which the syndicates are autho-
rised to grab are mostly in the coming province
of the North. Separation is now admitted to
be inevitable, therefore the Brisbane specula-
tors propose to bleed the North to the very
last drop of blood and the last speck of gold
before that event takes place. When Separa-
tion comes, and North Queensland starts busi-
ness for itself as an independent province, it
will be utterly and irretrievably ruined. Its
lands —for the Bill actually permits the possible
seizureof nearly one-half the province, its mineral
deposits, its railways, its rivers will be owned
by the Criffilwraith railway kings. It will
have no land revenue, no mineral resources save
the scrapings of its old goldfields, no room for
expansion—nothing save the hideous liability
to be incurred in the re-purchase of the laird-
grant railways, sundry malarious, fever-ridden,
snake-haunted wastes about the Gulf, and
those deserts which the syndicates didn’t
take because they were not worth taking. It
will be swamped by cheap paupers, imported
by the syndicates to occupy and give additional
value to their stolen lands. It will be bossed
by the syndicates ; the votes of some 2000
miles of railroad and 100,000,000 or 200,000,000
acres of land, and the personal suffrages
of the syndicators and their dependants,
hangers-on, employes, and pauper settlers will
man down the scanty population, and command
a majority vote in the Legislature. The
country will be ruined and over-run by Chinese,
Kanaka, and similar immigrants brought in by
the syndicates to keep wages down, because as
wages go down land values go up. The syndi-
cates will command the means of locomotion,
and—as the experience of the United States has
demonstrated —the command of the means of
locomotion is the ownership of the earth. And,
in short, the Criffilwraith endowed railway
syndicates will own the earth and the waters,
and have a lien upon the atmosphere, and the
bodies and souls of the nation will lie theirs,
» * #
The only remedy for the tremendous evils that
must come upon the North when the Criffil-
wraith land-grant device gets into working order
lies with the North itself. When Separation is
secured, the first act of the new Legislature
should be to tear up the Land-grant Railway
Bill, to repudiate the syndicates and all their
works, to. revoke the grants, stop the surveys,
aud wipe out the whole robbery in one act. If
it is enacted in the North Queensland Consti-
tution—as it certainly will be—that the North
takes over all the responsibilities put upon it by
the old Brisbane Legislature, then the Consti-
tution must be promptly amended, or if it can-
not be amended it must he torn up also. I he
case is so utterly fraudulent that no oaths or
parchments or Acts of Parliament should be
allowed to stand in the way. The sanctity of
pledges deliberately entered into by the people’s
alleged representatives, and ratified by the
Cabinet and the Sovereign’s deputy, is not suffi-
cient to cover such an enormity. Even the
Englishman, with his patient, ass-like reverence
for every State document which has been
engrossed on sheepskin, and signed by a duly
constituted authority, and decorated with a
huge plug of red sealing-wax, would admit as
much in similar circumstances. If any British
Legislature and Sovereign, being led away by
the hunger after hard cash and possessed of the
devil of unscrupulous speculation, were to enact
in legal form, that all Great Britain and Ireland
were to be given away gratis to a Chinese or
other foreign syndicate, all the reverence in his
patient soul would not prevent him repudiat-
ing the contract without compensation, and
dethroning the monarch who sanctioned the
ghastly monstrosity, and gaoling, for high
treason, the Ministry that propounded it, and
every legislator who lent them his support
or countenance. The present case is
exactly parallel except in one essential:
the Griffith-MTlwraith Coalition deliber-
ately proposes to give away, absolutely for
nothing—for the railway which is supposed to
be the equivalent has to be paid for afterwards
quite apart from the land-grant—an area vary-
ing, under the alternative agreements, from
one-and-a-half to three times the size of the
British Isles. Therefore, the fraud upon the
present and the coming generations is so much
the greater.
# # #
And not only would North Queensland, and,
indeed, all Queensland, be justified in tearing
up the contract with the Criffilwraith syndi-
cates, but it would also be justified in denoun-
cing those w r ho had consummated the job as
public enemies, in impeaching them for treason
to the Commonwealth, and in dragging down
Samuel Griffith from his seat on the judicial
Bench as one who had demonstrated his
unworthiness for the office he assumed. And
if the Imperial courts should be appealed to
and should give judgment against the State,
and the Imperial power should he enlisted—an
extremely improbable contingency—in support
of that judgment, then there remains one last
alternative—armed resistance. However hope-
less such a course might be, it would be easy to
justify it so far as the unwritten code of
patriotism goes. History is full of reverence
for patriots who fought to save a kingdom, and
there is the raw material for three kingdoms in
this colossal land-steal.
They Meant Well, but They Didn’t
Know.
Editor Bulletin, The New South Wales
Legislative Assembly has just turned out
another Electoral Bill. It ought to be a
good one. If any legislature in the world
might be supposed to have attained com-
petence to construct an Electoral Bill it is
this one. For something like five years it has
been practising the art and mystery of electoral
law making. Its members have talked reams
and volumes in debating one electoral bill after
another. The outcome of this long and severe
experience is now on its way to the Legislative
Council, very possibly to be received with
derision and dismissed with ignominy. Of
course, the Council may “ amend ” the bill,
There are instances in which the Council
amends a bill passed by the Assembly very
much in the fashion employed by Bluebeard to
correct a wife. In other instances it treats the
Assembly’s offspring in the spirit of the wicked
uncle of romance. It receives it with every
appearance of respect, but hands back a
hideous changeling which the parents refuse
to recognise. Under present circumstances,
there may be reason for believing that
the Assembly’s little bill will be accorded
at least the concession of a decent reception,
A measure which embodies the fruits of labour
so long, consideration so deep and so protracted,
and wisdom so cultivated, can scarcely be
thrown contemptuously on to the dust-heap.
During the course of the reiterated discussions
which have taken place in the New South
Wales Assembly, there have been reviewed
almost every principle which could by any
ingenuity be conceived to attach to the question
of representation. On the whole, those dis-
cussions have resulted in the adoption of certain
theorems, by common consent. Not indeed
quite unanimously, because there have been a
number of members holding off in a sort of
sulky aloofness, who are understood to believe
that the only fault of the existing electoral law
is that it gives the common people (who have
no stake in the country) too large a share of
influence.
# * *
But, apart from such gentry, whom nothing
would satisfy save a despotism with themselves
for despots, there has been a pretty general
agreement that every man in tire community
should have one vote for a member to represent
him in the Legislature, and that no man should
have more than ono. Moreover, that every
vote should have precisely equal value and
effect. Also, that at a general election all the
elections should take place on one day. Fur-
ther, that no man should be precluded from
offering himself as- a candidate for election
merely on account of having no ready money.
It is generally agreed that by the realization of
these three essentials the progress of Democracy
will be ensured and accelerated. I say, it
is generally agreed : that doesn’t involve your
own concurrence. Let us examine.
# * #
Take first the celebrated “
vote.” This has become a sort of sacred phrase,
instinct with holy virtues, which it would be
sacrilege to question. The way in which some
people have come to say this phrase, as if it
were a short prayer or invocation, useful for
exorcising evil political spirits, makes one want
to call for the steward and a basin. It re-
calls the old Scotch woman and the blessed
word “Mesopotamia.” You have always been
in favour of the abolition of plural voting, such
as has been permitted by the present electoral
law of New South Wales. It was one of your
erstwhile colleagues and comrades in The
Bulletin who first proposed it to the New
South Wales Legislature. But with the sense-
less idea that every man in the community has
an equal right and fitness to exercise the
franchise—which seems to be the form the
theory takes in sundry ill-instructed heads
—no intelligent man can have any pati-
ence. The very contrary I hold to be
the case. The fitness of men to exercise
the electoral franchise is just as varied as their
fitness for writing an essay, or leaching a
class, or cleaning a watch, or driving a


steam-engine, or composing an air. The ideal
electoral law would be one which gave every
man a vote and some men from two up to a
thousand, according to their capacity for
making good use of the privilege. The fellow
who gives his vote to Jones because that candi
date sings a good song, and shouts glasses
round at the local pub. should be overborne by
the extra vote of the fool who gives his
suffrages to Smith because Smith makes long
and earnest speeches which seem wise because
he—the man with two votes—can’t understand
them, and because he consequently believes that
Smith will prove a valuable legislator. And
that well-meaning fool’s two votes ought to he
obliterated by the three votes of the man who
knows that Jones is a shallow windbag and is
unable to recognise the superior intelligence of
Smith. And the whole series of these and
similar voters with their single, duplicate
and multiple votes should be overborne
by the thousand votes of, say, the
late Archbishop Whately or Cardinal New-
man or John Stuart Mill. I had
nearly written “or Francis' Bacon.” But
the occurrence of his name serves perfectly
to illustrate the reason why this plan of plural
votes cannot be carried into practice. Bacon
had an intellect perfectly monumental. The
combined sense of a whole generation could not
weigh against it. But he was a rogue. It
would mar the whole system to confer multi-
plicity of votes on the wisest man on earth if he
were not as virtuous as he was wise. That’s
where the difficulty comes in. The honest man
is, as often as not, a very dull fellow. The man
of talent is, as often as not, a selfish, rascally
scamp. Plural voting is simply a widely-
diffused or diluted form of despotism. No
better form of human government can be
conceived than a benevolent despotism. But
experience, running back to the very beginnings
of history, has proved that while it is tolerably
easy to get a despot, a benevolent despot is to
be sought only in heaven.
# # #
The fact is, that no human judgment could
suffice to distinguish what men were entitled,
by their possession of wisdom and virtue com-
bined, to exert more power than their fellows.
And, failing such distinction, it is better to
submit to the evils which may result from an
equal allotment of political power, than to
aggravate them by giving extra influence to
men who may be rather less than more qualified
to make a good use of it. The idea that
possession of property indicates political virtue,
which lingers in so many electoral systems, is
intrinsically false and dangerous. Acquisitive-
ness is not ranked among the virtues in any
moral code. It. is generally denounced as a
vice, and in no code is it more severely repre-
hended than in that of Christianity. Besides,
property never fails to exert an influence
inherent in its very nature. Therefore, that
influence —seldom exerted for the general wel-
fare, but commonly for the accomplishment of
selfish ends—requires rather special counter-
action than special augmentation.
* # #
The theorem that every vote should have
exactly equal value has found expression in the
New South Wales Assembly’s bill, in the pro-
vision for equal electorates. Two thousand two
hundred electors anywhere are to elect one
representative. The result will not neces-
sarily be that there will be equality of voting
power exercised. Mill has examined this
position and has challenged its accuracy.
Gladstone has likewise impeached it. But,
after all, it does not greatly matter. Absolute
equality of influence eludes the voter in any
case. Unless all elected representatives were
of equal capacity and talent, no such equality
can be secured. The influence of the two
thousand,! wo hundred voters who will constitute
an electorate may be reduced to nullity by
their choice of a feeble representative, or it
may be hugely magnified by their selection of
a man of exceptional parts. The electorate
which has a minister for member exerts far
more influence than the electorate that has a
muff. Thus, dispassionately examined, it
therefore appears that single electorates will
not secure equality of influence, whereas it can
readily be understood that their adoption
involves extinction of minorities —a very grave
evil, and probably the one which would chiefly
bring about an early amendment of this law if
passed as the Assembly made it. Similarly,
the abolition of any money deposit by candi-
dates and the holding of elections on one day,
although presenting a superficial appearance of
favouring the poorer class of candidate, are
likely to operate with killing efficiency in a
contrary direction. A well-to-do man, desirous
of election to the Legislature, can prepare
the way, by keeping himself prominently
before the public for years previously,
and by judicious expenditure in charities
at complimentary banquets and so forth, lu
default of a money deposit every stump-orator
will offer himself as a “ Labour- candidate ’
and carry a few score, or some hundreds, of
votes from the regularly recognised choice of
organised labour. While the popular vote is
thus split, the notable man of the well-to-do
order will have no more competitors of his own
sort than before the deposit was abolished, and
securing a concentration of votes he will win
the seat. So, likewise, as regards all the elec-
tions taking place on one day. In a territory
peopled as is New South Wales, with a number
of concentrated groups of population, an over-
grown metropolis, and some very sparsely
peopled tracts, to compel the denser electorates
to wait for the distant and thinly settled ones,
will be to magnify the chances of the candi-
dates with the fullest purses. The democratic
element in the New South Wales Assembly has,
in framing this bill, “meant wellbut 1 hold
that “ it didn’t know.” —W.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Exit Griffilwraith.
Dear Bulletin,— The Griffilwraith dragon
is dead, but not ere it had devoured Queens-
land. Its manner of death was characteristic
of its whole destructive career. Its vertebra
hung together until Griffith clutched (lie
newly-gilded Chief Justiceship, and until
MTlwraith had made some of his syndicates
secure. The hollow insincerity of public pro-
fessions was never made more clearly visible
than in the Griffith farewell to Parliament.
“ I do not know that Sir Samuel Griffith has
one single enemy in the House.” said H. M.
Nelson, leader of the Opposition. It would
have been nearer the truth, and very near to
the real truth, to have said that Griffith has
not a real friend among the politicians who fol-
lowed him. Friendship only follows trust, and
no sane politician ever trusted Sam Griffith.
It must have been a spectacle for all the devils
of hypocrisy to have seen and heard Morehead
weeping over Griffith, and declaring how
“bitterly” he felt the parting. Morehead’s
bitterness must arise from the fact that he is
losing his favourite.victim of attack, and that
all Queensland politics appear to be dissolving
like the kaleidoscopic views of a chro-
matic design. Griffith owes his suc-
cess to his bowellessness, his celd-blooded-
ness, his intense isolation from all social
sympathies, the whisky proofness of his head,
his capacity for work, that bony and wiry lean
frame of his being equal to any calls made upon
it, his political unscrupulousness, his undoubted
legal ability in a sphere where legal knowledge
and ability tell, and his unshrinking acceptance
of credit for possessing all the “great and
good ” qualities that are supposed to belong to
the cold-blooded son of a “great and good”
(narrow, zealous, and bigoted) parson. If
Griffith dropped down dead to-morrow, all
Brisbane would go into formal mourning—
because Society is an habitual hypocrite—but,
outside his own family, nobody who could
afford it would eat one dinner the less. Summed
up, Griffith is a clever and heartless machine,
constructed to do admirable work where no
feelings of sympathy are required. He cannot
even hate. He can only simulate even that
master-passion of human nature. His main-
spring is ambition, and it is probable he is dis-
contented at heart because of human ingratitude
to him, though he knows no gratitude himself.
Some people get their biographies written in
their life-times, and this is a case in point. As
for MTlwraith, he is simply a syndicator—a
“ hero of civilisation.” He believes—and he is
honest so far that he does believe it —that vic-
tory is for the cunning and strong, and that the
spoils go to the victor. He has no fads about
human equality of opportunity. Show him
schemes for making money, and his only desire
is to lie first in the swim. He is Scotch,
choleric, and apoplectic, but he has enough
desire for life to have “ regulated ” his whusky
lately. He broke with Morehead after a trip
to Japan. He now goes to India. Has the
East another evil thing in store for him ?—H.O.
Reid Cuts a Tooth.
George Houston Reid, interval Leader of the
New South Wales Opposition, has climbed
down. Not that he ever climbed up to his
leadership. He was merely pushed forward by
dismayed malcontents at a time when no one
else cared to accept inconvenient responsibility.
However, being there, he has acquired import-
ance, and, becoming the exponential integer of
a party, it was found necessary to present
always his clean cheek to be kissed. His
previous attitude against Australian Federation
was obnoxious to the loosely-held party behind
him ; for politics are full of accidents, and even
a Reid might become a Premier under the fire-
works rule of Party Government. Reid’s con-
tinuance, then, as Leader of the Opposition,
depended upon his public conversion to Aus-
tralian Federation. The difficulty was to
invent a plausible excuse for an epileptical
change of front. Reid has on several occasions
consistently approached the feat apologetically
and from various angles. But his efforts were
never a success. At last the excuse has come.
Cleveland is evidently going to be elected Presi-
dent of the United States ; therefore, George
Houston Reid is an Australian Federationist.
The sequence is comical, but in keeping with
the freetrade hysterics of jubilation in Sydney
and Melbourne. The daily freetrade press
champs away at its editorials as if it were
already a proclaimed fact that the United
States had become a seaboard—two seaboards,
in fact —of free ports. “ Behold the Eclipse !”
cries the freetrade press, pointing to the
dazzling noonday sun; “let us go ballooning
in a coal-mine.” And it is done. Cleveland
is to be President; therefore, Reid is a
Federationist. The Emperor of Morocco has
lost his umbrella ! therefore, Freetrade is as
dead as last year’s yesterday. Q.E.D .
Something’ Wrong with the Works.
Members of the New South Wales Works
Committee work exceedingly hard, and have a
very difficult task which they grapple in the
most energetic manner. It requires the most
anxious care and most strenuous exertion oa
their part to find themselves something to do.
There is no prospect of any loan funds being
available for a single work which is not already
in course of construction, but the Committee
keeps on sitting with a persistence and deter-
mination not to leave off, which would be
creditable to a broody hen. They have already
inquired into, and despatched sectional com-
mittees (with two guineas per day travelling
expenses) to investigate, about a million sterling
worth of works which can’t possibly be under-
taken until fresh batches of loans are floated.
And as it becomes daily more difficult to find
anything for them to inquire about, some of the
members have hit upon an ingenious plan for
preventing the whole thing coming to
an untimely end. They develope an insatiable
hunger for information, and make one witness
go as far as half-a-dozen used to, in earlier
times. With proper management one witness
can be stretched out to cover an entire sitting.
First the Chairman asks him questions. Then
one member invents as many more as he can,
and when his ingenuity fails there is a third
member ready with a fresh batch of interroga-
tions. Should the imaginations of these in-
dustrious members give out, and no more new
questions occur to any of the Committee, some
member of it steps in to the rescue and asks
the old ones all over again. In this way the
stock of witnesses is economized and the duties
of the Committee will last out this Parliament
anyhow. It used.to interest people at the Colo-
nial Secretary’s office to see one committeeman
brought day after day by his wife in a cab from
a bed of sickness, crawl feebly up the stairs,
drop into his chair exhausted, and earn his
three guineas. The whole business is attended
with a lot of queer work. One member of the
committee, who is far from esteemed in the
Chamber of which he is a member, managed to
get himself elected without difficulty by men
who would have preferred to elect the Soudan
goat. His plan was to corner his fellow
members separately, complain plaintively that
the others had such an unjustifiable grudge
against him that they wouldn’t give him a vote
for a position which was of considerable conse-
quence to him, and express his assurance that
the member he was addressing was not
that sort of a man and would oblige him with
his support. Then the member solicited would
conclude that one vote for the fellow couldn’t
elect him, and would promise him a vote rather
than face the embarrassment of refusing. The
old hand worked this with so many members
that enough voted for him, each believing he
was giving the man the only vote he’d record,
to elect him handsomely. And now he goes
round intimating in his sleek way that the
number of votes he received is a gratifying
proof of the respect and consideration in which
he is Held by his peers.
The “Star” on Socialism.
Says Sydney Star ;
The socialist who takes to the stump and posts as the
friend and saviour of the labouring classes belkvcs in
equality of distribution, but not in equality of produc-
tion.
Now, this is either a gross mis-statement or an
exhibition of limitless ignorance. No Socialist
who understands his subject advocates absolute
equality of distribution ; Avhat socialists demand
is a nearer approach to it than now prevails,
and they desire to make it impossible for one
man, who performs no useful office, to receive
£lOOO daily, while another, sweated out of
human likeness, earns 1000 pence per annum.
Socialism, therefore, does not ask for equality
of distribution but for fairer distribution, and,
knowing “ equality of production ” to be impos-
sible with unequal abilities is, unlike the Star,
not idiotic enough to believe it a corollary of
an approacli to equality in distribution. The
equality that the Socialist demands is neither
of result or share, but of class, circumstance,
effort, and opportunity ; that equality in social,
political, industrial, educational, and judicial
matters that mankind has always been unjustly
denied for selfishness sake.

Ever since four—only four—working men were
appointed to the Maoriland Council the demand
for elective Upper Houses has begun to rage in
the Tory press of Australia. So long as the
Tory party felt absolutely certain that every
Australasian Cabinet would continue to fill its
nominee Council with broken-down political
hacks, money-lenders, bankers, auctioneers, land-
agents, land-boomers, prosperous publicans,
and solid, corpulent employers generally, it
stood like a rock for the old nominee principle.
But now the horrible truth has begun to dawn
on that party that a Cabinet may arise, now
and then, which will actually nominate a few
democrats to the Council, and an exceeding bitter
cry goes forth that Upper Houses ought to he
elected—on a property qualification. The bogus
Liberals of the country will doubtless support
this proposition on the pretence that any kind
of an elective Council will be better than the
present variety—that it will be getting in the
thin edge of the old, blessed, stereotyped
wedge—and that a Council elected on a pro-
perty qualification will be “a step in the right
direction,” and will ultimately. lead to man-
hood suffrage all round. In reality, it will do
nothing of the sort. A Council elected on a
property-qualification will always be strictly
Tory ; it will be stronger (as witness
the experience of Victoria) in the cause
of property than the nominee body, because it
will have its constituents behind it as a sup-
port, whereas the nominee Council has no sup-
port at all; it cannot be swamped by a
democratic Cabinet: and it cannot be reformed
save with its own consent, and its constituents
will help it to resist reform. An Upper House,
elected on a property basis, is an institution
without one redeeming feature, and will sound
the death-knell of democratic progress.
The Shiels Government (Vic.) is quietly stone-
walling the bill for the repeal of the so called
Voluntary Liquidation Act, which measure
plainly has no earthly chance of passing this
session. The Voluntary Liquidation Act, or,
more correctly, the Act to prevent liquidation
and cover up the frauds perpetrated by “repre-
sentative citizens,” is one of the most remarkable
measures ever sneaked through the Legislature
by a broken-down banker and his accomplices.
Under its provisions the busted companies,
which are now being quietly wound-up without
any unpleasant scandal or exposure, can’t be
placed under the supervision of the court unless
by the decision of a majority of the creditors.
The advantages of this arrangement are beauti-
fully obvious. At the original liquidation
meeting the boss director probably took the
chair, and being armed with a barrow-load of
proxies presumably genuine from alleged
creditors, many of whom only claimed an odd
shilling or so as the balance of a current
account, he promptly secured the appoint-
ment of the same old gang of directors or
their friends to do the winding-up. Then
these individuals peacefully set to work to
smother their own swindles, and write off their
own overdrafts, and report that their own
bogus securities were all right, and their own
doings all perfectly honest. And now this
arrangement can’t he overset in the majority of
the cases because it requires the votes of more
than 50 per cent, of the creditors to do it, and
more than the required 50 per cent, are
generally absentees, or dead men, or persons
who can’t be found, or persons who never could
be found, with old balances of a shadowy
amount standing to their credit. The genuine
creditors can’t prove these individuals to be
bogus, and thus the liquidators, with their
dead men’s votes, are masters of the situation.
A good many “ banks,” where there would
otherwise be much trouble, are being wound up
peacefully under this blessed system ; and the
Shires Cabinet, which acts as if it were the
pimp and flunkey of the good, old, representa-
tive gang, though it hasn’t the courage to
openly oppose its abolition, is gently, but
effectively blocking the Bill which has been
introduced for that purpose. It doesn’t commit
itself, but every time the Bill comes up, somc-
thing gets in the way, apparently by accident.
The sinful absurdity of the “ fine or imprison-
ment ” system w'as vividly illustrated at Rich-
mond (Melb.) police court, the other day.
Several larrikins were found guilty in various
degrees of brutally ill-treating a woman, and
whilst one of them got sent up for a month
certain, another, considered to be less culpable,
was sentenced to “ £lO, or three months.” This
by a law which professes to make no distinc-
tion between the stonebroker and the million-
aire. Presuming that in the latter, case the
culprit couldn’t raise a “tenner,” or that he
possessed the virtue of Thrift and couldn’t bring
himself to cash up the sum required, he is
serving three times the term of imprisonment
which will purge the greater offender of his
guilt. Looked at from a purely financial point
of view the cost of incarceration in a dungeon
is here fixed at £3 6s. Bd. per month, and the
wealthy bank swindler, who might easily write
a cheque for a hundred years of penal servitude,
has a right to consider himself aggrieved when
he doesn’t get the option.
Tadema and Poynter have received £2OOO
for painting panels on a piano for an American
millionaire.
The late Deputy-Master Hunt (Sydney
Mint) distinctly told a Bulletin man that no
power existed to coin silver at that “branch of the
Royal Mint.” A new Deputy-Master reigns, and
he (according to Premier Dibbs) has apparently
discovered that “authority already exists under
the Order-in-Council ” that authorised the Mint
to perform the work of gold coinage. Now, there
is only one “ Royal Mint ” of England, and only
one “Master of the Mint.” Any outside mints,
such as those of Sydney or Melbourne, have no
official status beyond that of “ Branch of the
Royal Mint,” and their “ Master ” is only
“ Deputy Master.” The “ Annual Reports of the
Deputy Master of Sydney Branch of the Royal
Mint ” (the late Mr. Hunt assured the writer) are
required to be furnished direct to the Royal Mint,
London, and not until they have been received
they be furnished to the Government
and Parliament here ! Indeed, the writer is not
quite sure that the boundary-line of the late Mr.
Hunt’s statement was not this —that he sent his
annual reports to London, and that it was London
which sent them on, as a matter of routine
courtesy, to the N.S. Wales Government.
The latest addition to N.S. W. National
Gallery, Poynter’s “Queen of Sheba visiting King
Solomon,” is not only the largest and most ambi-
tious canvas on the walls, but sad to relate, it has
also cost more money than anything that has been
purchased up to the present time. The sum paid
for it was >£2900, and considering that it was
originally bought, only some two or three years
ago, for .£6OOO, it would seem at first glance that
the trustees have made a remarkably good bargain.
This, however, is hardly the proper light in which
to regard the transaction. A picture whose
market-value has deteriorated in so short a period
to the extent of more than 50 per cent, is scarcely
likely to increase in value. The truth is that
Poynter’s art is, and always has been, of a purely
conventional type, and as the tendency of modern
taste is to revolt against conventionalism the
chances are that the artist and the school to which
he belongs will, before long, be either forgotten or
despised, except for the technical merit of
the productions. This picture is unquestionably
the painter’s masterpiece, and shows to the full
his knowledge of the period he is illustrating.
Thoroughness was ever Poynter’s motto, and
nothing could exceed the conscientious care with
which he has studied every possible detail and the
consummate skill he has shown in representing
them on the canvas. Take, for example, the
management of the bright sunlight finding its way
from behind the canopy over the throne and
striking the red pillars in the background, than
which nothing could be more masterly in treat-
ment and realistic in effect. Indeed, as a mere
piece of workmanship it would be impossible to
praise the picture too highly. But something
beyond the ability to paint and the possession of a
deep knowledge of archaeological lore is required
for the production of a work that can truly be
called great, and that something is certainly lack-
ing here. Neither the figure of Solomon nor that
of the Queen possesses any dignity, and they sim-
ply strike the spectator as ordinary models,
dressed up in gorgeous attire for the purpose of
being painted in somewhat constrained attitudes,
while none of the numerous crowd loafing
round the throne appear to take any interest in
the proceedings. The one touch of nature in the
whole picture is the graceful girl in the foreground,
poised on her left foot and turning towards a
monkey she is leading by a string. When it is
taken into consideration that in the Sydney
Gallery there are no examples of such painters of
the English school as Alma Tadema, Frederick
Walker, Dante Rossetti, and Burne-Jones, all of
whom are greater artists than Poynter in the
highest sense of the term, it certainly seems that
the =£2900 might have been more wisely expended
than in the purchase of a picture, the sole interest
of which consists in the accessories. It may be
mentioned that the advent of this new arrival has
necessitated a re-arrangement of the gallery with
the result that the Poynter is flanked on one side
by Topham’s vulgarly-painted and ill-drawn
“Savonarola ” and on the other by Long’s trivial
and inept “Dorcas Meeting,” so that whatever
benefit there was to be derived by contrast has
been accorded to it.

Has flashed the news o’er land and sea;
Be wakeful now, ye ranks of Right 1
Ye need no arms, the coming fight
Will prove a bloodless victory.
The Day is near, tho’ yet Night shrouds
The fertile earth it held so long.

Your voice can break the jealous clouds
That veil the laggard light of Wrong
Unite your votes ! Your foes will fall
Before your numbers in the fray ;
No glitt’ring steel, no “ pinging ” ball,
No beat of drum, no bugle call
Will usher in the long’d-for Day.

Holds naught to cope with stolid Law ;
Be true ! The Fates your laurels wreathe ;
Vob Victis ! To your sons bequeath
All gifts divine as spoils of war.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Nov. 22, 1892.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
On dit that the reason why a certain Governor’s wife
won’t open the frequent exhibitions of a certain society
(not to put too fine a point upon it) is that she never
knows what’s going to happen to her when she gets there.
The first time she went, a piece of music, composed
expressly for her, was performed, and when it was over
somebody asked if the composer might be presented to
her ladyship. She graciously assented, but when Wagner
was led up by the ear he was hopelessly tipsy ! His beefy
bow halt an inch off her ladyship’s nose gave him away in
one posture, and his reply in response to her Ex.’s well-
turned compliments wasn’t intelligible enough to be
phonographed. That’s vice-regal experience No. 1.
Experience No. 2 is less vulgar, but more aesthetically
painful, perhaps. The society in question is a mixed
aggregate, and as her ladyship was being escorted round
the show (on her second visit) by all the presentable com-
mittee-men, an utterly impossible member burst through
the cordon and hurled himself at the Governor’s wife.
He was effusive and aitchless, but it was at his dressing
that Her Ex. drew the line. Large-check pants, a pepper-
and-salt coat, no waistcoat, and a tweed cap, is hardly
the sort of get-up you’d order before escorting a
Governor’s wife round a show, and yet this thunder-and-
lightning party hung at the vice-regal elbow during the
whole parade, while the half-crown audience stood aghast.
And now for the most horrifying incident of the lot.
Her Ex. has just arrived at the show, and was being
received by the committee when a fat and eccentric
member stepped forth and actually chucked her under
the chin! “ You’re looking cheerful, me lady," he said
encouragingly, “ but you’re too pale—we wanter see more
roses in yer cheeks”—but his poetic flow was out off
short at the meter by the justly-affronted patroness rush-
ing past him speechless with indignation. She gave up
the society in despair after that, and when the next
deputation called at Government House to bespeak her
patronage they were received by a frozen aide-de-camp,
who remarked in a fog-like manner that her ladyship was
too—er—nervous to patronize a show where the unex-
pected almost always happens (or words to that effect) ;
and now the exhibitions are opened by all sorts of
illustrious odds and ends who don’t dream of the pitfalls
they’re risking.
The Sydney citizens’ return oall last week to Mayor and
Mayoress Manning was the social failure of the season—
from the prononcd decorations to the nutshell crowd.
And no wonder, for there was precious little sympathy
with it. It is part of the “ I take but I surrender” game
to give the City at least one big headache in the Town
Hall during the year, and the City doesn’t feel inclined to
rise frantically on its hind-legs and trump the purely
official trick. And it strikes me as being indelicate, too.
In society, the social I O U is redeemed in a lighter manner
than by flatly “returning” this or that festivity—just
as one old woman hands a gridiron over the back-
fence to the other old woman who lent her a tub.
On the principle of one for you and two for myself, a
return ball to a mayor or anybody else is no more to be
objected to than any other outbreak where a handful
of men resolve themselves into a committee, and
cadge a few pot plants and a flag or two, and announce
the tickets one guinea. Because the idea is really to
“ fill ’em up agin,” in a manner of speaking—to dovetail
another barn-darnoe into the order of existing things.
Besides which, there are men who pine and wither unless
there is a prospect ahead of perspiring behind a big
blue rosette and gyrating in the middle of a waxed floor
making jump-up signals with a spotless handkerchief for
the band to play “God Save ” on the “approach of the
Guvnah.” This gentleman (of course not the Governor)
is always spying out leaks in the social armour which can
only be properly plugged with a ball, and the result is—
well_that he has his inopportune moments.
“ Fools rush in,” &c., comes into your head when you
think of giving a banquet (with Burdekin on the arrange-
ment committee) to Lord Charles Precedence Scott. It was
decidedly a risky game. As Sydney once narrowly escaped
ceasing to be Australia’s chief naval station because the
scion of the house of Buccleuch was placed at table on
the off side of the Governor of the neighboring province,
if would have been in better taste had they hit on a
festivity less fraught with disastrous consequences in the
past. Also, Lord Charles was understood to remark on
the momentous occasion that “ he would never aga’n
at tend another public dinner in Sydney ’’—but, I suppose)
that doesn’t oount. When a man says he will never go to
another funeral ha doesn’t mean that he isn’t going to his
own.
The daily papers have leaders now on the question of
female Toby Tosspots. The discussion all arises from the
fact that a certain titled Englishwoman said, the other
day, that piok-me-ups and “ nips ” and “ pegs ” and
“little goes” were quite boudoir refreshers nowadays,
and that women openly drank champagne-cup without
any hesitation. All of which can go for gospel. In
Sydney, haven’t we swell bathing-rooms where ladies go
ostensibly to have a wash, hut where the faintest wink at
the attendant procures a “reviver” of masculine
malignity? There’s a terrible amount of “boozing”-
good old Shakesperian word, I assure you—nowadays,
and some of the results are tragic.
One could pile up instances of pleasant homes going
under the hammer, and of children farmed out all round
because of a wife’s intemperance. The latest society
instance is a lady—(yet)—a charming woman, too, with
several cherubic children and a devoted husband. Her
case is in the doctor’s hands, and he advised taking her
away from her cronies—every drunken woman has a lot
of drunken hags of “ friends ”—as the last hope. So her
husband started her out on a long sea-voyage, idiotically
enough, I think, for there is every temptation and oppor-
tunity to give way on a ship where people go about pre-
scribing all sorts of nips as infallible remedies for mal-de-
mer. And if she travels in the ladies’ cabin she’s lost.
I’ll never forget a woman I left in a ladies’ cabin once.
She had an empty beer-bottle on either side of her and one
at her feet, and she was howling for brandy-and-soda as if
her life depended on it.
The enormous catalogue of John Harrises who turned
up in the lawsuit at Sydney over the will of a gilded
defunct of that name points to the moral that a tribe can
overdo calling every boy-baby that comes along by the
name of its rich uncle in the hope that he will get a fat
bequest. It often only leads to the lawyers getting the
whole oyster.
Lady Jersey has commenced “impressioning ” about
the “ Australian Colonies” in an English monthly, but,
judging from cabled scraps, this article is simply sop
compared to the yarns which, I’ll venture to wager,
M.E. J. will spin about us when her foot is on her native
heath. Lady J. will yet turn out livelier copy on Aus-
tralia than this article, I’m sure. Where is the woman who
wouldn’t let herself go on the subject of a land where the
only redeeming feature was that nobody copied her
bonnets ?
At the return ball to the Mayor of Sydney the other
evening the fun in the gentlemen’s cloak-room consisted
in fitting on Sir Henry Parkes’ hat. As Sir Henry takes
an out size in head-coverings it obliterated most of ’em as
effectually as an extinguisher.
The objections raised in Melbourne to the tugs-of-war
between teams of women strike one as being most ridi-
culous considering how long this sort of thing has been
going on. There always have been feminine war-tugs.
For instance, when Mrs. de Smythe enters a room with a
new frock on and sees Mrs. de Jones there already in a
newer—there’s one then.
Madame Weigal’s fashion journal for November is out.
It shows nothing new, except that some of the young
ladies reveal a gooddealofcollar-bonetor street-work, and
some of the bonnets seem to argue that Australian
belledom’s skull is as sun-proof as the woolly pate of
King Billy. Waists are still kept down to indigestion
pitch, and the Watteau bow—having descended to the
cheap Jacks—doesn’t figure any more in the plates of
Wei gal.
The alleged defrauding of a Sydney jewellery firm by
“Colonel Andrew Burney” was a serious matter, no
doubt, but still the victim got a “ displayed ” advertise-
ment out of it: “Witness showed the accused a gold
chronograph saying that it was the same as one worn by
Lord Jersey.” And now we all know where Gov. Jersey
got his watch.
But the jeweller almost deserved to be taken down, for
his deep and placid trust in everything that came out of
Government House. He parted with the jewellery
“entirely on the representation that accused was stopping
at Government House ! ” Imagine what a holy of holies
the Governor’s residence must be when a tradesman
cheerfully hands over nearly £lOO worth of rings and
things just because a well-dressed man throws down an
envelope with the vice-regal crest on it and takes the
lord’s name in vain !
The pupils of Sydney Technical College cooking-class
are “disaffected,” because the two lady examiners of
their work have been replaced by two doctors and the
chef at Parliament House, and only an “insufficient
reason ” given for the change. B it, to my way of think-
ing, “set a man to judge the meat ” ought to be a pro-
verb. Most of the cookery in the world is done for man
the hungry animal who devours right down the tndnu in
public places, while woman diffidently orders a cup of
tea and a bun. Women don’t care for an elaborate set-
out, though I think they are more snack-hungry than
men—they require more cups of tea and spasmodic pastry
hut, judging by the way they choose an ice-cream in
preference to a prime cut, I should say man was far and
away the more competent as a judge of cookery. So long
as the aspirant for culinary laurels puts a heavy frost of
pink icing on the top and a great deal of paper-collar
round her pie, the lady judges wouldn’t be able to contain
their raptures, though the competitors’ plain chop was
raw in the middle.
The Bananaland youth is far indeed from the fold of
social culture. lam told that a large number of him
never by any chance speak of a lady as a lady, but call
her, bluntly and inelegantly, a “gin.” At a* dance, if
you ask him who is his partner, ten to one he tells you
“ that gin in the green dress over there and even when
he is engaged he proudly points out his lady-love as
“There’s my gin!” The only way the Queensland girl
can get square is by calling him “ King Billy.”
I hope the N.S.W. Animals Protection society won’t let
the idea of a horse-and-cab parade in Sydney Domain fall
through. Everybody likes to ride in a smart hansom
with a sleek horse instead of being bumped along in a
broken-windowed sarcophagus behind amass of hair and
fatigue; and by giving prizes to the best turn-out you
minimise your chance of emerging from a cab like
Ophelia, with straws in your hair. lam sure a house-to-
house collection would soon raise enough money to pay
all expenses of a parade—and if they could only get the
conspicuously liberal Bishop Smith to hand the" prizes
to the successful cabbies there would be nothing left to
wish for.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

or eight hundred times more. Even the dog'
which devastates the red - haired Y.M.C.A.
person, and tears most Of the clothes off
that mangled hypocrite, palls after a while.
Apart from the fact that Mr. Gourlay seems to
throw his dishevelled personality up in the air
more wildly at each successive revival, there is
nothing new to report. The agile John and his
partner, Mr. Walton, fill the parts of the two
Y.M.C.A. youths with eclat. Mr. W. Warner,
with a bad cold, does the heavy policeman that is
afflicted with the iron tank-intellect. Mr. G.
Lash Gordon, as a mahogany-headed detective,
presents sundry commendable features ; and that
pretty little lady, Miss Amy Gourlay—about the
only person in the bill who is allowed by the
author to conduct herself as if she wasn’t off her
glossy little head —is a bright oasis in a desert of
frenzy, and a shining light against a background
of cast-iron mirth.

Fillis’ Circus, at Sydney Carrington
Grounds, seems pretty well up .to its promises.
The trained elephant and educated monkey ele-
ment is tolerably strong in this show, as it is in
every right-thinking circus, and the pony-race
with apes as jockeys appeals to the true inward-
ness of an Australian audience. The lion-taming
act is even more thrilling than usual, for the four
animals are all of a bitter and sulky disposition,
and their desire to dine on the lion-tamer is
obvious from the very beginning of the perform-
ance. Up to date that scarred veteran has dodged
his fate successfully, but his end is assuredly
approaching. The prettiest feature in the pro-
gramme, however, is the tank performance—a
bright and original item which lacks the horrible,
raw-beef significance that attaches to the lion
business. Professor Beaumont and two airy, fish-
like maidens hold a series of revels under water in
this act, and gambol around at the bottom of the
glass cistern like a frog’s birthday celebration.
Then the Professor throws quantities of
loose silver into the tank, and dives down
with his hands tied behind his back, and proceeds
to collect it in his mouth. It is a weird sight—
this aquatic gentleman, with the limelight on him,
feet upwards in the water, and gathering small
change with his head ; and when he has collected
it all, and, rising leisurely to the surface, spits
£2 17s. 3d. into a plate, the applause is tremen-
dous. After that he descends with about 501bs.
of shot in his arms, and lying down at the bottom
of the tank goes off to sleep—apparently. He is
reputed to have stayed at the bottom, with the
shot on his manly chest, for something over
minutes ; on Saturday, so far as the excited
audience could keep the record with its watch, he
remained under for minutes. This aquatic
performance is the great success of the show, and
if Fillis wants to make the biggest fortune on
record, he should turn the whole arena into a
tank, and run the entire exhibition under water.

Sydney, at the present time, just manages
to support two theatres and a few side-shows and
cycloramas in reasonable comfort, but what will
happen when the Royal, Criterion, and Lyceum
get into working order grows more and more
problematical. There is no money in the poor,
dejected city, and unless the management makes
a new departure, and, failing hard cash, takes
deposit-receipts and bank shares at the door, it is
difficult to imagine what will happen. Legally-
executed assignments of debts due by building
societies, equities of redemption, debentures, and
second mortgages might also be accepted. Other-
wise, one at least of the new theatres seems likely
to become a doss house for the unemployed, or else
a soup-kitchen.
** * *
“The English Rose,” with still another
member of the Rignold family—Lionel, cousin of
George and his brother Biil—in the lead, will take
the stage at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) on Saturday.
Lionel is a newly-imported gentleman from King-
land, understood to be a thing of considerable
beauty and a personal ornament. A strong co.
has been organised to support him, and “ the
celebrated horse, Bushman,” has been engaged for
the steeplechase scene.
** * *
The veteran James Hasker, aged 74, is to
have a benefit at Sydney Royal Standard on Mon-
day (28th Nov.). The theatrical managers of the
city, with the single exception, so we are informed,
of Mr. John Gourlay, who gave his support on a
generous scale, appear to have looked somewhat
coldly on the old Australian actor, and he has had
to fall back on the assistance of the Government
Printing-office Dramatic Society. A benefit in an
obscure theatre with the aid of an amateur co., no
matter how capable, is not the send-off which a
man of Mr. Masker’s years and reputation de-
serves, especially considering the huge benefits
which are bestowed so lavishly on the imported
mummer. Still, The Bulletin trusts and believes
that the show will realise a handsome profit for
the venerable artist.
** * *
Adelaide Royal was shut for a week to
allow of fumigation, after Rickards left it, and it
re-opened on Saturday (Nov. 19) with the Green-
woods in “My Sweetheart.” The sisters Albu
began a concert-season at the Town Hall on the
same night. At Garner’s, Bateman and O’Grady,
helped by F. C. Appleton and others, have been
playing “Current Cash,” but there hasn’t been
much cash current. On Saturday they changed to
the “ Wearing of the Green.”
&* * *
“Joan of Arc,” at Melbourne Princess’s,
had its career prolonged over Saturday, owing to
the sudden indisposition of Marion Hood, a fair
vessel who seems apt to become “ laid up ” at criti-
cal moments. On the Friday night, a medium-sized
substitute appeared unexpectedly amidst the folds
of the original amazon’s armour, and meandered
through the name-part without drawing much
attention to the other lady’s absence. But when
the time came for changing the bill, Marion was
still unable to show, therefore an extra perform-
ance of “Joan of Arc” took place, whilst “Miss
Esmeralda” was announced to happen on Monday
last. The enrollment of Clara Merivale as a
member of the Gaiety Co. should strengthen
matters rather than otherwise, so “ Miss Esmer-
alda ” is doubtless another unparalleled success.
Marion’s sickness may even turn out to be
a melancholy blessing in disguise, but no
matter. The very last night of “ Joan ” acquired
poetic interest from the fainting away of Alice
Lethbridge, during a pas de deux with Lonnen.
As the comedian picked up his partner and bore
the lovely burden away, a suspicion that Alice
might have died in the discharge of her duty ran
through the house. Indeed, a johnnie in the
reserved stalls was about to choke himself with his
opera-glasses when the performance went on as
usual and public confidence was restored. Subse-
quently Alice came forth once more to get such a
reception as may perhaps encourage her to reel
and fall gracefully on some future occasion.
Meanwhile it is satisfactory to know that the
plucky young creature, who always whirls regard-
less of the weather, didn’t seem to have suffered
by contact with the floor. Happy boards !
** * *
Sassiety has been giving generous support
to “Niobe,” at the Bijou, partly because the
comedy is funny out of the ordinary way, and
also because the honourable reign of B. and B.
draws rapidly to a close. Even the gallery is
learning to see some good points in Niobe, not-
withstanding her unpopularity with those gods of
yore, who, as Brough explains to the astonished
Greek lady, “have had to knock under.” On
Tuesday last Mrs. Brough benefited in “ The
Squire’’and portion of “Dandy Dick,” but the
old bill was to be renewed on the following night
and will run until Saturday, when Grundy’s play,
“ A White Lie,” takes the stage.
* * *
The other three Melbourne theatres are
not of much consequence just now. After one
night of “The Stolen Goddess” the Alexandra
shut up more completely than the old Royal, inas-
much as the Royal is hired for an occasional per-
formance. The Alabama Minstrels are in the
throes of a final week at the Opera House, and
nobody talks of filling their place. Also Max
O’Rell has folded up his lectures and gone silently
away from the boomed city, and the Gaiety is
taking a rest until Saturday.
** * *
St. George’s Ha'l still struggles along
under the management of Coghill Bros., however,
and the Waxworks have been visited by the
wonderful talking cockatoo, a bird of such rare
intelligence and sensibility that somebody had to
shut out its view of the wax figures before it could
be induced to speak at all. They suggested death,
and in the presence of a corpse the cockatoo felt
bound to maintain a respectful silence.

The Melbourne Exhibition Building was
recently the scene of a ghastly mockery described
as a Ladies’ Tug-of-war. A few big Women,
assisted by a number of small girls, engaged in
spasmodic pulls at a rope. Sometimes they pulled,
but more often they were drying their delicate
hands on the upper portions of their garments, and
altogether they were a plenteous source of woe to
sundry charitable associations of the softer sex.
Moreover, they proved a financial failure—
Speaker Bent, the two Houses of Parliament,
several bookmakers, and a contingent of lecherous
Chinamen being the only respectable patrons of
the entertainment.
** * *
Preparations for a different class of exhi-
bition in the same building are being pushed
along. A Santa Claus Festival is getting ready
for Christmas, and the musical features of this
new enterprise promise to catch on. Some of the
people now singing at the Saturday concerts will
burst forth in operettas, and of afternoons there
will be a performance of Julien’s tricky British
Army Quadrilles, which consists largely of brass
bands marching up from the distance to the strains
of warlike music and finishing up with “ Rule
Britannia,” or something, on the platform. As a
musical illustration of h’Old Hingland’s glory this
masterpiece always achieves a dreadful triumph,

Carington, as the new Lord Chamberlain,
promises to be a gorgeous joke. Although the
public knowledge of these functionaries is con-
fined to the fact that they are nominal licensers
of plays (the Queen alone knows what other duties
they dally with), it has been usual for the L.C. to
leave the care of the drama to somebody else. Of
late years, a Mr. Pigott has been the actual
play licenser. Carington, however, promptly
seized the idea of personally looking after the
interests of British morality. He notified the
London managers that he proposed to be present
when they made their next application for the
renewal of their theatre licenses, so that he might
form their acquaintance, and enquire after the
Lotties and the Totties in a strictly official
manner. Also, he intends to read all the plays
that are suspected of being improper, with a view
to seeing whether they make him blush. If
they don’t make him blush, Carington will
pass them, so ’Ome stands a chance of getting
some piping-hot comedies shortly. The question
of ballet-girls’ skirts being a specially important
one just now, Carington has privately announced
his desire to inspect all ballet-girls respecting
whose wardrobe there is any possible shadow of
doubt whatever. Furthermore, he is understood
to be considering the advisability of putting lead-
ing ladies through their Catechism, in order to
find out whether they are as good as they should
be, and if they fall short of his ideal they will
have to sit in the Lord Chamberlain’s office and
grow better. Altogether the late Gov. of N.S. W.
promises to bring an ancient billet fairly up to
date. Six years of yawning in Sydney restored
his jaded constitution considerably. The old
Adam has reasserted itself in our friend the Baron,
and he intends to make things hum in that path of
life to which it has pleased God to call him.
Mrs. Beefcon says: “Claret should be
sound, fruity, and soft as satin, and all the com-
ponents happily blended into a homogeneous
whole. Easy of digestion, it is a mildly stimu-
lating drink, in every way fulfilling the Scriptural
character as a ‘ wine that maketh glad the heart
of man.’” Innes’s Boar’s Head Clarets, at all
grocers, at Is., Is. 6d., 25., and 3s. a bottle, can
be recommended as purer and better wines than
French clarets, and they are only one-third of the
price.

“ Yvonne,” who has written the lyrical music for one
or two of the recently-produced comic operas, notably
“Incognita” at London Lyric, is no other than our old

There will be an interesting performance at Melbourne
Royal on Saturday, the 26th, when Miss Harrie Ireland
appears as the heroine in “ Clytie ” for the benefit of her
veteran papa. Miss Ireland is a handsome, clever girl,
who may, one of these days, be boomed a la Essie
Jenyns.
’Edmund Fisher is “trimming” the Princess panto.
Probably “ the old hand and his gal ” are working on the

Bill Holloway is very chirpy and very much to the fore
in London, and, when the mail left anticipated making
a hit as Kent in “King Lear.” He says, contrary to
general rumour, that he has no intention of returning to
“ the colonies.” He also states that Essie Jenyns’ sister
does not contemplate adopting the stage as a profession.
Hullar, snake-charmer, in Melbourne, from America
and India, revives all the Shires and Underwood business.
He picked up 60 tiger-snakes in the recent Seymour

Wybert Reeve, as stage-manager of the Melbourne
Bijou, had a very off-hand style of cegaging supers., and
used just to pounce on whoever he could find outside the
Stage-door, in Little Collins-street. The yarn goes that,
wanting a captain of the guard tor the Majeronis’ “ Eliza-
beth,” he impressed a magnificent civil servant who hap-
pened to be passing.
Very nervous was Billy Emerson, at Melb. Opera House,
the other night, introducing a joke about Wales and
baccarat, for he might remember how another American,
Fred Lyster, put his foot in it, and was nigh driven from
the stage by venturing a joke, in a Ballarat hotel, about
the Clontarf business.

Marie Halton has been a success in “LaCigale,” at

Stephen Fiske, an American critic, relates that Mary
Anderson’s first big success was in the “ Lady of Lyons ” ;
and Fiske was so enthusiastic about her that he rushed
round to invite the whole Co. to supper. Then he found
that the new star had gone home. The Co. went after
her, and discovered her sitting on a trunk, eating a
cold pork chop with her fingers, but she promptly
abandoned the chop, and came out with them to the
nearest restaurant, where she supped on candy and raw
oysters. There must have been a good deal of the ostrich
about Mary in those days.
The veteran Wybert Reeve, lessee of Adelaide Royal,
has latterly been in a most melancholy mood. He says
that during the past 18 months he has produced 77
different pieces, ranging from high tragedy with the
Jewess Bernhardt to the very lowest of low comedy with
that excellent Christian Rickards—and yet people aren’t
satisfied. During the Rickards season, indeed, the
receipts got down to £8 one night, and even on the Prince
of Wales’ Birthday they were less than £4O. It costs, if
Wybert is right, more than £5O a night to run the show.
The Italian Operatic Co. smashed finally the other day
in Dunedin. The papers were unfriendly, and made
remarks about the bulky proportions of Signora Cuttica,
and even charged that sweet songstress with having a voice
that was half-way between a steam-whistle and a nutmeg-
grater. The weather was cold, and when an Italian is
cold he is about as unmanageable as a boa-constrictor
that has got frozen. And finally, after much friction
over various small matters, the red-nosed and frost-bitten
company said it would see manager Jinkins darned first,
and declined to sing a note.

One Barlow, in the Contemporary, has a blasphemous

Says the S.M. Herald ; “ The tug-of-war at (Melbourne)

about 3000 spectators, the Speaker and several members
of Parliament. The spectacle was degrading to those who

apple-cart, that there was one spectator, at all events,
who couldn’t be much debased by that or any other

saying, ‘ Mr. Sheil has a horse.’ The next day Mr. Sheil
remitted to his brother magistrate a case of wife-beating,

Fleming Norton seems to have made a good impression

Haddon Chambers seeks knowledge at the fountain
head, and as a dramatist looks for his types of character
in real life. He has thus acquired an extensive and
peculiar knowledge of “Greater London” which might
almost be envied by even Walter Besant. While pere-
grinating a few evenings ago, he met a friend, with
whom he sauntered into London Pavilion. As they
entered and took their seats they noticed a little knot
engaged in an animated discussion, which ceased as they
passed. Presently one of the disputants arose with,
“ Mr. Chambers, will you let me interdooce you to my
friend, Jem ’All, a countryman of yours?”—whereupon
Jem seized Haddon’s hand with a grip of iron. “ I’m
proud to meet ye Mr. ’Adding Chambers. D’ye see them
chaps over there? Well, they’ve been arguin’ an’
chyakin’ me till I got riled. I says to them, ‘We can lick
England at scullin’, and we can lick ye at flghtin’, an’
s’eip me, I b’leeve we can lick ye at any think.’ ‘ All
right, says they, we grant ye can do us at scullin’ an’
boxin’, but ye ain’t got no Manky brains!’ An’ jest
then you come in.” “ Look ’ere, you coves,” said Jim,
pointing triumphantly at Haddon, “ what d’ye say to
brains now, eh? Ain’t Mr. ’Adding Chambers got ’em,
eh?” And so, thanks to Jem Hall and Haddon Chambers,
the intellectual repute of Australia was saved.

Should his health have improved, Sir
Charles Lilley will probably address a meeting in
Sydney Town Hall, upon his return from Maori-
land. If he does, he will receive from the Sydney
Republicans a welcome recalling that extended to
Grey.
Lilley is the founder of Free Education in
Australia, having written in the Governor’s
speech, in 1869, that all the schools in Queensland
should be free. His efforts to make the grammar-
schools free were defeated by one vote. Two years
afterwards Victoria followed Queensland.
Chief Justice Lilley gave the copy of his
judgment in the big law-case to the B. Telegraph
reporter, with a warning not to let the manuscript
get into the hands of the Courier; and Buzacott
had to wait in humiliation until he received
revised proofs from the TELEGRAPH. This may
have had something to do with the bitterness of
the Courier’s attacks on Lilley.
Queensland having refused to join in the
cable guarantee, London Times ' : has decided to
exclude all Queensland cable messages from its
columns.” So much the worse for the Times.
Every time a Queensland sensation is prominently
dealt with in the cable columns of the live London
dailies, the fast-waning Times prestige will get an
ugly knock. It might as well decide to exclude
the daily quotations of London Stock Exchange.
The announcement only goes to prove on what
insane lines of self-complacency the senile grey-
beard of the press is now being run.
Sir Julius Vogel has been appointed
London manager for the New York Life Assur-
ance Co. Any live company always likes to
get a big, glaring, expensive man for a figurehead,
and Vogel, that hardened borrower of many
millions, is big and glaring and expensive
enough for anything. Unless the auditor keeps
an eye on him he will presently hire the whole
Royal Academy to paint the door of his private
room, and have the carpet bordered with pearls,
and “shout ” gold teeth for the entire staff as an
advertisement. Still he will push business
tremendously, unless the big rival company hires
Wales as a counterblast.

The syndicate press are praising Lords Kintore
and Jersey for “the valuable work ” done towards the
settlement of the Broken Hill strike. Everybody else is
asking what they did, and where the proof of it is to be
found. Perhaps it is through their influence that the
miners have only to crawl back on their hands and knees,
instead of wriggling back on their bellies, and that the
thick-souled directors are not using bigger hob-nails in
the thick-soled boots with which they are vigorously
jumping on the broken unionists. Even this modified
service, however, does not appear to be well authenti-
cated.

IHTThe Broken Hill sub-contract system is begin-

“ Can it be the apathy of despair that causes the
silence, or at least the dullness almost to acquiescence, in
the financial scandals and present wretched state of
affairs?” asks an indignant Geelong man of the Argus.
No, it isn’t the apathy of despair. It’s the influence of
too much meat consumed in an enervating climate, com-
bined with the appalling fact that every third “influen-
tial ” Victorian is using his influence to shut up the man
on either side of him.

Says a Melbourne paper “It has transpired
that for the five half-years preceding August 31, 1891, the
bona fide sales of the Freehold Land Investment Company
amounted to only £30,057, while fancied sales—those
made with other companies of the group—were set down
at £415,850. The outgoings of the company for the same
period in excess of receipts were £158,567, and yet
£111,148 was paid in dividends, the directors taking no
less than £67,437, upon sales which proved to be fictitious
ones. The profit was assessed at £88,775, in addition to
which interest was credited to profit and loss. During
the same period £122,775 was charged as interest to
unsold properties and treated as realised assets.” In the
face of revelations like this, it begins to be doubtful if
there was any real boom at all. When a land co. could do
no genuine business even in the alleged boom period, and
only lived on paper by forming bogus companies, and
selling its properties to them at fabulous prices, and tak-
ing bills for the money—well knowing the bills wmuld
never be paid, and that the sales might as well have been
made to a corpse—it seems questionable if the darned
thing ever existed except in the offices of the Davies and
Munro “ banks.”

The city man of the Times recently made
comparisons between the banking systems of Australia
and England—the one relying upon the principle of
association in times of difficulty, the other depending
upon the assistance of the Bank of England, which in
turn looks to the Government Treasury in periods of crisis.
He quotes Bagehot in support of the Australian principle,
which he calls “ natural,”'but thinks the English system
is not wfithout its advantages.

The wild cat mines of N.S.W. have had a big
weeding-out this year. Few mines but paying ones are
now working, simply because shareholders absolutely
refuse to pay calls, and as nine-tenths of the companies
are “no liability” there is no chance to enforce payment.
It is a hard time for mining managers, scores of whom are
unemployed, and many of them too poor to get away
from the country which they rushed in the boom. Up-
wards of a hundred, including some really good men,
recently applied for a £5-a-week berth.

There is one Maoriland field which receives a
lot of Sydney newspaper puffing. We have read a hundred
times that the Try Fluke has returned ten times its paid-
up capital in dividends without any allusion to the
amount of its paid-up capital. It may be only sixpence a
share. The Great Mercury appears to be a payable mine,
but nothing to rave about. The reefs are numerous and
variable, the gold of low grade and so fine as to render
the saving of more than 70 per cent, economically difficult.
Great things are predicted of other two-men-and-a-ho.v
shows there, which appear to have only a hand-to-mouth
existence.

Dear Bulletin, —About 40 miles from Charters
Towers there is a silver-mine on the Star River, called the
Hero, owned by a Sydney Co., who have spent £20,000,
one way or the other, on the property and its develop-
ment. The manager himself, being fully convinced,
strove to convince the rest that the mine contained
enough silver to make a nation rich. He also got some
silver and made the shares go up, but the shareholders
got demoralised by his glowing reports and forgot to pay
the last call with that promptness, &c. And so the work
stopped right there, and the mine was hung up till further
orders. It is said the Co. has decided on dressing the ore
now above ground and all they can find below, though the
exact date is not mentioned. We, in Dead Man’s Gully,
are much excited over the report. Arniirim.
-jf*
The market value of all big mines swings like a
pendulum. Public madness, fomented in its greed by
those who could measure the mines, carried the Broken
Hill claims to a value they will never reach again. People
who bought in the very youth of the boom did so because
they believed “there was going to be a boom.” Ask the
scores of ruined Queenslanders why they bought Mount
Morgan shares on an aggregate value of seventeen
millions, and you are told : “ We were quite convinced
that they would see double the money.” They mathe-
matically measured the mine, and based the worth of the
millions of tons of rock which remained in the mountain
on the value of the tew thousands of tons taken out. No
allowance for depreciation is ever made in a boom. Yet
there never was a mine in the earth without a choice spot,
and never a mine that did not work that choice spot as
soon as discovered. How some men must have chuckled
and grown fat in “ selling as a favour ” Mount Morgans at
£l7, Broken Hills at £l4, Souths and Centrals at more
pounds than they now are shillings !

Lawyer Crick’s public narration of the <£2-10s.-
a-week-clerk-in-.a-chaff-shed who started a bogus bank in
Sydney and got deposits totalling £76,000 from the poor
public, is good reading. “ Whilst the money came in,
how he spent it! He made friends in every direction,
contested Parliament, and paid the expenses of another
candidate who, he thought, might drag him in, biit a dis-
cerning public left them both out.” The Parkes Govern-
ment made him a J.P. ; he is now in gaol. He ran such
a mucker that, when on trial, “ he hadn’t enough money
to pay a second-rate attorney for his defence.” That was
a crime.

Ducker, who, at the outset, promised to be a
bold and dashing liquidator of the Mercantile Bank of
Australia, has disappointed expectation thus far. He
seems rather a lame-Ducker in pusuing the investigations
which Simpson’s graphic report ought to have simplified.
# # #
No sooner was the Broken Hill strike settled
than the contractors on the British mine attempted to
abolish the 20 minutes “cut ” or spell for tucker in the
eight hours. Had they succeeded their next game would
likely have been to compel the men to put in a full eight
hours on the face, which meant, in most cases, a loss of an
hour or more in walking to and from the shaft.

The Northumberland (N.S.W.) miners seem
averse to the proposed alterations in the 1888 agreement
as embodied in that now submitted, fearing that every
amendment is an insidious attack on their rights as
unionists, and a covert, though none the less effectual,
attempt to entail a reduction in wages. The proprietors
feel the urgent necessity for stimulating trade by reducing
selling price, and consequently lowering wages, while the
man act on the principle ’Us belter to “ bear those ills we
have," &c., and therefore resist the excision or altera-
tion of any of the old clauses.

The farce of holding a school-like examination
at N.S.W. Mines Department for the appointment of
mining inspectors reminds the writer of the time when
the Victorian mining law compelled every mine engine-
driver to have a certificate, and to pas-f an examination
to get it. There were men who had been driving all their
lives who knew nothing of the technical requirements.
One who had been at the game 30 years appeared before
the examiners, some of whom had received their practical
training under him, nevertheless, they questioned him ;
“You have been driving many years ?” “Yes.” “Did
you ever have an accident?” “Yes.” “Many?”
“Yes.” “Did you ever have any through over-wind-
ing?” “Yes.” “ But did you ever have one serious, pre-
ventible accident? ” “Yes.” He passed.

A correspondent : The late Thomas

on the same ground. Woolner could mould a
plaster bust of Wentworth with his eyes blindfold,

often performed.

oyer a splinter that had got into
his thumb through a stumble on
the fo’c’s’l. Taking out a pearl-
handled knife “ Toby ” proceeded
to remove the cause of the bag-
man’s woe. He got it out all
right, and Gov. Jersey nearly had
a fit when the Attorney-General
staggered backward to the bul-
warks, after hauling out with in-
finite pain one of the whisks,
at least a foot long, that had
recently formed part of an Ameri-
can bass-broom. Every “ fly ”
person knows the joke : you push
the point of the splinter under a

other end with your other hand

pugilist Mitchell when the latter committed the

Haddon as “ a very distinguished dramatic author,

was fortunate for him that he did not go into the
box, as intended, to give evidence for Mitchell,
for Magistrate Vaughan is a Quaker and abhors

probably have had a lecture from the bench on the
evils of bad company.

The late Carl Feilberg, of Brisbane
Courier, was very fond of fishing. He was also
very near-sighted. One Saturday afternoon he
and a friend went down the river on a fishing trip,
and having caught five whiting by about tea-time,
went ashore to cook them. Feilberg fixed the fish
on the gridiron, and, turning to his friend, said :
“ Oh, well, there will be three apiece for us, any-
how.” “No,” replied the other ; “how can that
be —there are only five ?” “ Five ?” said Feilberg,
counting them—“one, two, three, four, five, six.
Six, sonny.” They had a oan-opener shaped
something like a fish, and poor Feilberg was cook-
ing it on the gridiron along with the other com-
ponent parts of the repast.

Technical College, where he lectured on agricul-

old system, which is so injurious to health, and
claims so many victims. He contemplates shortly
going to N.S. VV. to establish works to operate
upon the low-grade lead ores of Broken Hill and
Sunny Corner, which are at present worse than
useless owing to their poverty. This should prove
a most important industry. Prosperity has not

James Cowie, last of the notable early
fathers of Victoria, died last week, aged 84, and
the Argus gave the old gentleman the half-column
obituary notice to which he had established his
claim more than forty years ago. James Cowie's
final appearance as an “ identity ” was at the
recent Melbourne Corporation jubilee dinner,
where he figured as the most interesting relic of
public life. He was Mayor of Geelong when
Governor La Trobe laid the foundation-stone of
the local railway terminus to the first line con-
structed in Victoria, a member (and for some
years sole survivor) of the original nominee
Council of the province, and again a member of
the first Legislative Assembly after Separation.
James Cowie had “made a rapid fortune in
Australia” before most of the “representative”
Victorians of to-day were born, certainly before
any of them were talked about. In 1848, he
issued a small paper currency which ranked as
equal to coin in his district. What inhabitant of
the Cabbage Garden could do as much to-day ?
Cowie dropped out of public notice when public
men began to be windbags, and a clean personal
character was no longer estimated at its proper
value, but he remained a shrewd, albeit rather
cantankerous old Radical up to the day of his
death. Many of his reminiscences have supplied
material for Bulletin paragraphs, and as an
authority on the ancient history of Victoria’s
“ first families,” James Cowie was invaluable.

“OH DON’T TOUCH ME! DON’T COME
NEAR ME!”
These words were uttered with a howl—almost a
yell. Yet the boy to whom they were addressed
wasn’t within 10 feet of the howler, and wouldn’t
have come closer for his life. The scene was a big
business office in New York, and the howler was
the chief man in it. He owned the concern, and
was very rich, and a decent fellow enough. But
sometimes he would break out like that, and howl
as though he had just discovered a fire in a
powder-mill. You could hear him from the base-
ment to the roof. What was the matter with
him? Temporary insanity ? Not quite, but some-
thing nearly as bad. He had an acute attack of
gout in his toe, and at those solemn crises he
couldn’t bear the sight of even a shadow moving
in his direction. Ask somebody who has the gout
how it feels. Fancy a blacksmith twisting your
toe with hot pincers while a shoemaker is thrust-
ing a bradawl through your knee-joint. That’s a
little like it.
Well, there are things not so bad as gout, yet
they make us touchy enough. Here comes a man,
for instance, who says, “ Everything now was a
trouble to me.” What should he talk that way
for ? Why should everything have been a trouble
to him ? There is an old saying that while we
can’t keep the crows from flying, we needn’t let
them make nests in our hair. That’s good sense.
But it’s easy to give advice and to quote proverbs.
How does a person act who suffers from boils ?
Now, the foundation of all feeling and pain is
the nerves. An hour or two of toothache is a
lesson on the nervous system. But there are
diseases (or one disease anyhow) in which all the
nerves in the body seem to tingle to every sight
and sound. The mind is on the look-out for evil
—the man is depressed and afraid. Every word
means mischief, and every bush hides an enemy.
So he thinks. He knows what Solomon meant
when he said, “The grasshopper is a burden.”
Mr. Michael McCormack is a railway messenger
and lives m Mullingar, County Westmeath,
Ireland. In June, 1890, he was taken ill. His
mouth tasted foul and coppery, his stomach was
sour and dead, and when he forced down a little
food he felt so much distress and pain after it that
he was sorry he hadn’t let it alone and gone
hungry. Besides this, there were pains wander-
ing through his chest, back, and sides, hurting
him, biting here and there like ugly dogs loose in
a town. His head swam with dizziness, and he
couldn’t go to his work. All his ambition and
energy were gone out of him, and he would
scarcely have exerted himself even if he had been
suddenly promoted from the position of messenger
to that of station-master of the biggest station on
the railway.
“After a while,” he goes on to say, “a dull
heavy pain struck me in the back, so I couldn’t
stoop over. What I suffered from this and the
other things put together, I have no words to
describe. I had six months of it, and it was like
six years. In such a case a man takes medicines;
all he is told about. This I did, without getting
any good from them, and I got weaker and weaker.
Everything was a trouble to me; I couldn’t bear
things I used to think nothing of.
“In December, 1890, just before Christmas it
was, I first heard of Mother Seigel’s Syrup and
what it had done in cases like mine. I got a
bottle from Mr. Rogers’ Drug Stores, and before
I had used all of it I felt wonderfully better ; and
by keeping on with it a short time every pain and
ache went out of me, and I was able to go about
my work as well as ever I was in my life.” These
facts are vouched for by H. Rogers, Esq., Town
Commissioner, Mullingar.
Now, what made messenger McCormack’s
nerves so sensitive, and his life so miserable for
six months? Indigestion and dyspepsia; the
same detestable malady that does the same ill
turn for millions of others, men and women, of all
sorts and conditions. Plenty of them will read
this true and simple story, and our opinion is—
founded on the best of proofs—that if they try the
remedy which cured McCormack they w'ill come
out of it as happily as he did. But the sooner the
better.

The indecent scramble on the part of
Hume Black and other moribund politicians to

“Noah and all the creeping things went up into

Judge Windeyer has graciously decided
that a Victorian marriage-certif. may be accepted

It is believed, despite Griffith’s denials,
that a short session of Queensland Parliament

S.A. Legislative Councillors claim that the
public are opposed to the Land Values Assess-

The Agent-General for Barataria is allowed
something between £IOOO and £ISOO a year for
the expense of entertaining “distinguished colo-

Auditor-General en gros, or are vouchers de-

With Victoria’s shocking example before
them, the Tasmanian Government has instructed
Agent-General Braddon, despite his protests, to
relinquish all “guinea-pig” appointments. In
future, also, he will have to pay bis own British
income-tax.
In N.S.W. Parliament. Schey: “ Suppose

Generally whispered that Berry will make
a desperate attempt to resume his Agent-General-

Under the Downer (S.A.) regime S.A.
Civil Service economy has reached such a pitch
that no official can order stationery without the
written approval of his Minister. Barrel pens
are interdicted in one department. “ Nibs is
good enough,” said the responsible Minister.
Playford’s latest:—“There was a time
when he thought land should be kept in the hands
of the State, but of late years he had come back to
believe in the old-fashioned system of freehold.”
Alas ! The poor man is now politically only fit
to be corked down in a jar of methylated spirit.
Threatened with a cavalry charge from
the O’Loghlen, Berry “thinks Mr. Gillies” —
whose coalition with O’L. would be fatal to the
Shiels-Berry crowd—" is well fitted for and
possesses very high claims for the Agent-General-
ship.” Talk about spreading the net in the sight
of the bird !
That the N.S.W, Ministry should allow a
whole night to be wasted over so meaningless an
affair as Want’s motion condemning Schey, M.P.,
for his dead and buried charges against Commis-
sioner,Eddy conclusively proves to The Bulletin
that they are “sparring for wind.”
“The powers of Cabinet Government are
increasing.’’ Here you have the N.S.W. Govern-
ment calmly Undertaking to guarantee £2OOO a
year, for 30 years, to at French Cable-Company,
without saying at single word to Parliament about
the matter. Such a system leaves the door opefl
to all sorts of jobbery.
Wanted—-soine' N.S.W. Member of Parlia-
ment to introduce and Bill Upsetting the present
privilege of thieving lawyers—a Bill enacting that
any lawyer receiving and applying to his own use
a client’s money shall be sent to gaol and branded
with a broad arrow like any other embezzler.
Let one of the Labour members introduce such and
Bill, for which every honest man must vote. The
issue is one clearly between privilege and the body
of the people.
The relations be-
tween hard cash and
high official “honours ”
were touched upon
gently by the cultured
Dr. Dobson, when he
declined to be nomin-
ated for the Presidency
of the Vic. Leg. Coun-
cil. The Doctor ex-
cused himself on the
ground that he wasn't
rich enough to be able
to offer “representa-
tive ” hospitality to
visitors, but if an old
aunt had died and left
him a million the day
before hi s disability
would have been re-
moved. For the sake
of argument one may
assume that the gentle-
man Was Certain to get
the position on his
merits,- and couldn’t
afford to accept it.
Also,- One can' assume
that and President of
the Cou'ncil naturally
becomes a knight in
due course. Therefore,
Sif Zeal will rank as

Whilst pMin Dr. Dobson!
remains nobody in par-
ticular, for the reason
that the one possesses
more capital than the
other.
The proposed re-
duction in the Victorian
Governor’s salary is
strongly objected to by
a Bendigo paper on the
score that the callow
Hopetoun “gave
up a great deal to
serve the Queen and
the colony !”
Kow that co-operation is beginning to be
Understanded of the people, why don’t the bush
ilnions establish stores everywhere to supply their
rtlembefs with goods ? Why don’t their propa-
gandists travel on the box-seat of Waggon-loads of
needed produce, Whose cheap sale to shearers and
the like will pay their way ?
“ Toby ” Barton says, aiid the S.M.
Herald re-echoes him, that the N.S.Wb Upper
House will not dare to throw out the Elections
Act. But people continue to think that they will
so mutilate it, that it will furnish Dibbs and Co.
with an election cry to drown the shouts of
“ Remember Broken Hill!”
Premier Dibbs’ big talk about running the
N.S.W. Parliamentary session into next year is
only bombast. “Something” is sure to
“ Something” prevented Dibbs’ “special session."
“Something” curdled the Dibbs republicanism.
“Something” loosed him from Labour sym-
pathies. “ Something ” will shorten the session.
Griffith’s description of Hume Black’s
mission, translated into ordinary English, is that
he will camp on the door-mats of the Rothschilds
until they are induced to buy up the land-grant
railway concessions in the public interests of
Queensland. For this he will receive from the
State .£1000 per annum for three years.
“ Referring to his retirement, Sir Samuel
Griffith said he was bound to accept the dictum of
the House in moving him to a higher sphere.”—
They’ve raised him to a higher sphere.

But first they had to raise the screw.
Dr. Von Miguel, Prussian Minister of
Finance, has in hand a scheme for the gradual
nationalisation of ground-rents and of the un-
earned inorease in land-values. The Commissioners
are to be allowed to tax these two forms of wealth
according to their necessities. Should his scheme
be adopted it will be the longest stride yet taken
in the direction of practical socialism.

Sydney Echo started out the other day to
demonstrate that the famous M’Kinley tariff had
ruined the tinplate industry in the United States.
Since then the official returns from the U.S.
Treasury demonstrate that the American produc-
tion of tinplate has risen from 800,000 lbs for the
quarter ending 30th September, ’9l, to 8,000,000
lbs. for the quarter ending 30th June, ’92.
Grainger, M.L.A. (S.A.) has carried a
motion, against the strong opposition of the
Downer Cabinet, that a legacy duty of 10 per
cent, should be levied on all legacies of .£20,000
and upwards, and that a similar duty should be
levied when the estate is conveyed by deed of gift
instead of by will. The latter is the favourite
system whereby moribund rich men dodge the
legacy-tax.
The N.S.W. Railway Commissioners have
sent round a sort of round-robin, in which the
employes are requested to express their willingness
to give up their “home passes’’after 31st Dec.,
and pay half-fare, in future, when they travel
homewards at the end of a day’s work. No man
would willingly sign such a document, and it
simply means that the railway-servant who refuses
to sign must find work elsewhere.
J. H. Gordon, M.L.0., perhaps the most
eloquent and certainly not the least clear-headed
man in S.A. politics, has assigned his estate, and
resigned his seat in the Council—debts, £IB,OOO,
assets, £12,000. Though a solicitor he has the
confidence of the Trades and Labour Council, and
will probably go to the Assembly as a city member
next March. A Labour candidate will probably
run for his late seat.
“In Gladstone’s Whig Administration
there are 12 landlords with incomes ranging from
£SOOO a year to £50,000. There are as many
more with incomes between £IOOO and £SOOO.
About another 12 are men who, if not landlords,
have incomes between about £IO,OOO and £60,000
or £70,000 a year. It is hardly necessary to do
mote than mention these facts to show what feeble
hope there is of expecting real Democratic reforms
from such a crew. ’’—Reynolds’.
Sir W. Richmond Cotton, a London
broth ef-Turner of Premier Dibbs, would, it is
cabled, settle Australian labour disputes by ex-
porting to Australia “ fresh labour under a
properly organised scheme of State emigration.
In other words, by a capitalistically-organised
invasion of our country as deliberate and as
disastrous as any armed invasion. Which is the
betrayal of anew design on the part of the
organised Employers’ Associations —the indenting
of blacklegs under contract.
From S.A. Register, the erstwhile demo-
cratic paper, August 2, 1800 ;
In freedom lies our only chance of safety and progress-
freedom in land . . . freedom in religion and free-
dom to demand for labour the fullest and best prices and
conditions which the world can possibly afford. If labour
throughout the world could have a common watchword it
would be at this juncture, “ Beware of the politician
monopolist.'’
But what of the Register now? Ask Ohaffey
Baker !
Alfred Deakin, in the Victorian Assembly,
quoted a “ free gift preamble,” or some such orna-
ment of our blessed constitution, on a recent night.
It is improving reading and very characteristic of
the monarohial system—" We, your Majesty’s
most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Legislative-
Assembly, towards making good the supply which
we have cheerfully granted to your Majesty, have
resolved to grant unto your Majesty the sum here-
inafter mentioned, and do therefore most humbly
beseech your Majesty it may be enacted.”
Of the 54 members in the S.A. Assembly,
it is expected that at the general election next
March these will be rejected Sir E. T. Smith,
Messrs. Bartlett, Blacker, Caldwell, Oatt, Cock,
Henry Downer, Giles, Gould, Grayson, Hack,
Hancock, Handyside, Hawker, Hooper, Hopkins,
Johnson, J. R. Kelly, Lake, Lamshed, Landseer,
M'Donald, Miller, Osman, Parsons, Playford
(unless he again changes his district), Rounsevell,
Stock, and White. Of the other half, the doubt-
ful men are; Messrs. Brooker, Butler, Horn,
Moule, and Soherk, the seats of the remainder
being considered certain.
Queensland must be in parlous plight-
The “exigencies of the country demand” that
Editor Buzacott, of the invertebrate Courier, be
found a seat in next Parliament. At least, so h«
says in a letter to Grimes, member for Oxley, and,
further, proceeds with a request to thatM.L.A.
to vamoose, git, skedaddle, absquatulate, clear,
and make room for the said C.B. Not having
received a similar petition from his electorate,
Grimes bucks. It is clear that if Queen-street can
do it, the coming Parliament must represent
“patriotic” leaguers and land-jobbers, not the
country.
Says Sydney Echo, grabbing at the accus-
tomed straw : “The universality of smuggling
among females is a testimony to their hearty
sympathy with Freetrade,” and then the dismal
publication points to this as a solid evidence that
Protection is wrong, and should be abolished.
And seemingly it never dawns on the editorial
horizon that the universality of stealing and lying
equally proves that the laws against these things-
should be abolished, and that, on the same prin-
ciple, when aby crime, from garrotting and in-
fanticide down to heaving bricks at a blackleg,
becomes sufficiently common it ought to be
legalised right off.
The N.S.W. Parliamentary rule never to
take any new business after 11 p.m. was always use-
less. It gave the stonewallers every show to block
the transaction of work. In Victoria, Gaunsonand
Bent (now Speaker) often played with the House
for nights together, with one eye apiece on the
clock. At the stroke of 11, they resumed their
seats and were satisfied. The idea of this 11
o’clock rule was that a Government should not
spring a surprise on a thin House at a late hour.
Far better that than the present inertia. Legis-
lators are paid to be present, and, since they won’t
agree to work during the daytime, they are
expected to be in their places, no matter how long
the House chooses to sit. The present N.S.W. rule
is framed in the interests of a set of men whose
private business takes precedence of public affairs.
The Schey-condemnation resolution was
passed in the N.S.W. Assembly after 4 a.m.
Before that hour the first edition of Sydney Daily
Telegraph was in the hands of hon. members,
with a “leader” commencing
In placing on record last night its severest condemna-
tion of the conduct of the hon. member for Iledfern, Mr.
Schey, &c.
Now, suppose the division had fluked the other
way? The leader-writer has marvellous luck ; a
common reporter’s prediction would have been
falsified. The writer once undertook to report a
Kew concert for a Melbourne paper, “ from the
programme,” only to see next morning in a rival
daily—“ Owing to the inclemency of the weather,
the Kew concert was postponed.” This, after he
had judiciously marmaladed every notable per-
former, was too much joy, and he thankfully
resigned his billet without entering into explana-
tions.
Why is it that death should come before
the allotted age of “three score and ten,” and
why so many millions of human beings never live
to three score and five, and why that not one in
every thousand live to three score years? We
kill ourselves. Many intei'esting particulars are
found in tabh s of physiologists, and writers
on hygiene. The eminent physiologists, Haller
and Buffon, present interesting particulars on the
subject of longevity. They treat it in two ways,
historical and physical. The historical side of the
recitation of all facts known of the naturally
ordinary and extreme duration of life, and the
physical aspect of the problem involves the con-
templation of the great natural phases of develop-
ment of the species, digestion, period of growth,
and length of life. Mankind pays too little
attention to the warning voice of nature; signs of
approaching calamity are unheeded; the dis-
organisation of the affected organ increases and
after a time becomes insensible ; then no pain is
felt, and the sufferer is deluded into the belief
that be has shaken off the disease. Nothing
could be more erroneous or dangerous, for the
complaint has only passed on one further stage
towards the end, and nature ceases to send those
Warning aches and pains as they were unnoticed
when sent; the debility and weakness increases
however, and nervousness, loss of appetite, and
general languor comes on, and a cold is caught in
the kidneys, lungs, or liver, and another life is
sacrificed to Bright’s disease, consumption, or
some other serious and fatal disease. Scoffers can
talk as they like at the virtues claimed for
Clements Tonic, but even the most prejudiced
men know it is genuine and does possess merits no
other medicine ever did, an instance in the case of
Mrs. J. Bruce, 4 Victorian Terrace, Prymont
Bridge-road, Glebe, New South Wales, who
writes:—For the last 40 years I have suffered
excruciating agony with toothache, bilious head-
ache, indigestion, &c. Although having a sound
set of teeth, I have had toothache for a fortnight
at a time. I could not touch solid food ; the only
nourishment I could get was through taking beef-
tea, &c., and sucking it through a straw. I could
not get up till late in the day, and then it was
only for a short time, and I had to lie down again.
As for trying to do my domestic duties, it was
simply an impossibility ; it even seemed too great
a trouble for me to dress myself, so languid and
ill I felt. A short time ago I was persuaded to
take Clements Tonic. The effect was miraculous;
the toothache, headache, and tired feeling dis-
appeared after taking a couple of bottles. Now I
do all my house-work, although over 60 years old,
the. work seems a pleasure. I advise everyone
that suffers as I did to take it, as it certainly
cured me, and I cannot thank the proprietor
enough for the benefit I derived from it.—l am,
yours gratefully, Mrs. J. Bruce, 4 Victoria
Terrace. Pyrmont Bridge-road, Glebe, New South
Wales,

From Age, Melbourne Exhibition Report of Sept. 4, 1888 —“There is a most interesting exhibit by Messrs N. Lazarus & Co., of Calcutta, the well-known Indian and
London optician’s. Messrs. Lazarus & Co. conduct a very extensive business in Calcutta, as well as in England, and their experience as experts in their own particular line fully
en’inls if it does not surpass, the most eminent ophthalmic surgeons. Some of the leading surgeons of London and India have borne testimony to the accuracy of the mode of
diagnosing cases of the nature referred to, and during the short time they have been in Melbourne in connection with the Exhibition they have been interviewed by hundreds of
prisons who, perhaps, would never dream of consulting a surgeon.” „ T . _
From the Duly Tkcegrafii, Sydney, August 20, 1890.—“ A valuable addition to the ophthalmic science has recently been introduced bv Messrs. N. Lazarus & Co. It is an
i nproved method of sight-testing, and it is believed will prove of much benefit to the large number of people having defective sight. Messrs. N. Lazarus & Co.’s device as
exhibited at the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition, is a simple and perfect mode of discovering the slightest defect or difference in perception between the two eyes.”
From the Australian Star, Sydney, August 22,1890.—“ Improved Method of Siohttestino.— We have had an opportunity of visiting the rooms of Messrs. N. Lazarus
and Co Oculist opticians and seeing a practical experiment of their patent refraction test and system of sight-testing. Certainly nothing simpler or more complete than the
system of Messrs. N Lazarus & Co, could he devised. The test will show at once the nature and extent of even the slightest optical peculiarity, and the system of interchange-
able lense* and frames enables them to suit almost any case-

Tattersall’s biggest prize, £27,000, fell this
year to “ Jack” Layton, one of the leaders in the
great shearers’ strike of 1890, who up to the early
part of this month was far away in the North
West of Queensland, over 1200 miles from Bris-
bane. When the good news reached him he wasopal-
digging in the Adavale Ranges, and he dropped
his pick to scan the result-list. His great luck
didn’t upset him—“though, of course, I felt a
little excited for two or three minutes.” He is a
bachelor—a bashful, brawny, six-foot Scotchman,
30 years of age, and sober as a judge—a good bush-
man, a “ gun ’’shearer, aminer, fencer, horse-breaker
—everything. He has been in Queensland some
nine years, and has spent nearly the whole time in
the Adavale district. He leaves Sydney for
Scotland on 28th instant; three mates have come
with him to see him off. The news of his good
fortune preceded him all the way from Adavale
where his fellow-workers turned out to giv§ him a
send-off, to Sydney, where he has banked his pile.
He intends, after visiting Scotland, to return to
Queensland —where he will have no objection to
stand as a labour-member. Of Northern labour-
troubles he speaks with much feeling.

A well-known man was taken suddenly ill
in the Adelaide Speaker’s gallery and carried
insensible out of the House. The doctors sum-
moned agreed that the seizure was attributable to
excessive tea-drinking. He used to take about
eight cups of Chinese tea per diem. Since
“ swearing off ” he has gained 141bs. in weight,
and has never felt better in his life.

Auckland (M,L.) Court, when the Tenny-
son Cole trouble was on, drew a kindly distinction
between the two ladies involved. The legitimate
one had been known as “Mrs.” (English and
virtuous) Cole, the other one as “Madame”
(French and wicked) Cole, and the Court took
them at that. “ Madame ”is good. But if there
had been three of them what would they have
called the other one?

“A. T. Creswell” writes from Broken
Hill»
Editor Bulletin, —I have been accustomed (marmalade
struck out—El). B.)but your frequent references to the
Slcath-Cottoh episode (which is best forgotten)have made
me tired, tam one Of Mr. Cotton’s most intimate
friends, and can assure you on my honoUr that he has not
been presented with a silver-ihounted ruler, nor has any
social ftlnctiorl been held to celebrate the event.
With reference to this, TRe Bulletin has only to
say that the circumstantial statement telegraphed
to and printed by each of the daily papers to the
effect that Cotton’s friends had ensilveted and
jubilantly presented to him the weapon with
which he committed the assault on Sleath has, up
to the present time, never been denied by those
concerned, notwithstanding that they, like the
rest of Australia, must have been perfectly
cognisant of the statement in question.

Bishop Bob-cab Smith, Primate of N. S.
Wales, has inducted Rev. Joseph Best into St.

protests of the Matthewsians whose silver-love is

thewsians have got to take him just as they’d
take the measles, or smallpox, or any other
heavenly gift.

Dear Bulletin, — It is psychologically and
pathologically curious to note that the Sydney
girl, Maidment, who declares that “an angel,”
like unto her dead mistress, showed her where a
certain will was secreted, prefaces her statement
with—“ I teas not very well on Monday, and was
lying down on the sofa,’ &c., &e. In all alleged
supernaturalism, the clairvoyant, or vision-seer,
has generally to be in bad health before the
mysteries phenomenalise themselves. Thus, your
dipsomaniac sees no visions at all until ho ceases
his bout, and begins to “suffer a recovery.” The
writer has known such a one who will tell you
that he knows what he sees are illusions, but he
will dictate to you word for word what his (to
others invisible) dramatis persona are saying, and
will describe their actions. At other times he will
resolve into a cataleptic state for periods varying
from 20 minutes to four or five hours. Waking,
he will make certain announcements concerning
certain people he has visited —involuntarily, for he
has no choice Of selection —hundreds of miles
away, during his catalepsy. So far, these
announcements have always been Verified by afteri
neWs, and the events haVe happened as he
described. A curioUs feature is that if he does
not tell the nature of his psychic discoveries im-
mediately on waking, and while Still in a semi-
confused state, he forgets them absolutely as
thougl) they had never been. These are facts
within my personal knowledge. Can the medical
faculty explain them ? Must one get ill before one
is a clairvoyant ?— Dipso.

HIGGINGS : “Hallo, Dobbs, you’re looking seedy; are you feeling

Jealous Melbourne once more ! Sydney
produces its girl-slayer and suicide, bagnio murder,
a crop of heart-punctured babies, and several other
horrors, when, pouf! in walks Melbourne with a
three-volumed romance, in which the villain (who
fails to kill his woman and her husband, but suc-
cessfully suicides) uses, with picturesque effect, an
axe, with which he smashes his way into his
paramour’s house, an iron bar with which lie
breaks furniture into flinders, two revolvers, a
dagger and a phial of prussic acid. He climbs
into an engine-house and blazes away generally
like a stage hero, and then dies suddenly of prussic
acid as the police rush to overpower him. Sydney
throws up the sponge.
Did you notice how easily the intended female
victim of Melbourne’s latest hero eluded him ?
“Put out the candle, Ike.” He put it out, and
she slipped easily into the darkness. The man-
victim just stood his ground till he felt a bullet
graze him, and then bolted. One cool-headed
woman’s stratagem any time is worth the ordinary
pluck of a dozen average men, who will stand their
ground till they feel the sting of the lead, and
then—well, it depends on liver, conscience, beer
and lots of things women don’t use.
The passengers on a very swell Anglo-
Australian liner were at a loss to find out how it
was they could hear whispering in the cabin of a
French governess, Who was supposed to occupy it
all by her own little self. Sometimes they would
take it in turns to watch all night; and in the
morning, would have the pleasure of seeing the
little governess open the door, smile, and trip
gaily along the deck, leaving the door wide open
fot them to ascertain that no contraband male
was stowfid inside. One night, when they plainly
heard a man’s voice, the key of the cabin was ort
the outside. They turned it, and virtuously sat
down to wait the result. In the morning they all
assembled at the cabin-door to see the brazen hussy
found out, when a voice inside asked fot someone
to unlock the door. A fat old frump, With two
skinny daughters, set her mouth severely, stepped
forward, End turned the key. The little governess
tripped but, thanked het sweetly, smiled on
the expectant crowd, and walked off, leaving them
to search the cabin. It was empty. Yet every
night during the voyage they could hear a man’s
voice in the cabin ; but no one ever found out who
it was, or how he got there. P.S. —The ship had
pbrtholes.

Dear Bulletin, —Not long ago we could
send letters through the Victorian post for a
penny, and to N.S. W. for 2d. an ounce. Now it
costs us 4d. to get an ounce letter to Sydney, and
our minimum local postage rate is 2d. I think I
can see a time coming when the cheapest way of
corresponding with a friend who lives in an
adjoining suburb will be via Hingland. Already
it is the surest way. “ Mail ” letters seem to be
held rather sacred, whilst inter-suburban letters
are mostly prigged by the postman who “ clears ”
them at the pillar-box, or burnt, for the sake of
saving time, by the postman who undertakes to
deliver them.—Yours, Melbourne.

A lady urges in a Melb. religious paper
that Bibles should be placed in all the Coffee
Palace bedrooms, and, after that, in all the hotels.
Quite right, and the proper order of procedure.
Judge Windeyer (N.S. W.) —“A man
could not be too circumspect when visiting a
woman who was living apart from her husband.
However innocent the parties might be, it was a
most imprudent thing to do.” Kind gentlemen
anxious to relieve grass widows in distress should
paste this in their hats. They should also paste
in their hats this further maxim : If you would
keep out of trouble, never visit a woman of any
kind, at any time.

Bishop Camidge (Bathurst, N.S.W.) is an
artist in casuistical distinctions. He disapproves
of bazaars to raise stipends or build churches, but
has no objection to bazaars for church improve-
ment ; he thinks, however, the promoters should
be content with a profit of not more than 200 or
300 per cent. From which you would almost think
his reverence was running not a church but a
synagogue.

at the Waverley (Sydney) home of Mr. J. I.
Hunt, a well-known pressman. The artists noise-

proceedings of this surprise-party, the victim
cheerfully admits, contrast favourably with those
of the social surprise-party. They came without
ostentation, above all without noise, eulogy, or the
eleemosynary haul so often dumped upon the

The S.M. Herald proprietary wish us to
contradict the statement in last week’s Bulletin
that the will of the late John Fairfax contained a
clause making the holding of the annual wayze-
goose mandatory. In a Word, the present pro-
prietors give the entertainment for no other reason
than that it pleases them to do SO; We haVb jUst
been reading this year’s wayzegoose report
in the HeeAld aforesaid, and see that
the toast of “The Firm of John Fairfax
and Sons ” was “received with a special degree of
enthusiasm,” and was “drunk with great enthu-
siasm j” that Mr. J. R. Fairfax was “ loudly
cheered that Mr. C. B. Fairfax was “well
received;” that Mr. Geoffrey Fairfax was “re-
ceived with very great warmth ■” that Mr. J. O.
Fairfax was “received with applause;” and that
the absent Mr. Edward Fairfax’s health was
“drunk with much cordiality.” Who wouldn’t
give a big spread under such inspiriting con-
ditions?
AN UNBELIEVER’S DIRGE.
With growth of years one loses faith
In things you hear and see :
The bogey and the graveyard wraith
No longer frighten me.
I don’t believe in “less than cost,”
Or “ bankrupt stocks," ye ken,
And all my earthly faith I’ve lost
In “much-respected” men.
I don’t believe in Noah’s Flood,
Or Jonah and thfe Whale ;
I’m not impressed by Royal blood.
Or thrilled by fairy tale.
I’m grieved to say the poet scoffs
At Dan in Lion’s dea,
And also at those starchy toffs,
The “ milch-respected ” men.
I don’t believe in balance-sheets,
Or Addie Conyers’ leg ;
I see poor beggars in the streets,
But not in them who beg.
Young women’s smiles convince me not
(Except just now and then),
And O ! how very, 11 full ” I’ve got
Of “ much-respected” men !
I don’t believe in priest or monk,
Nor in Tom Walker's trade ;
_ Scant joy I find in getting drunk
And less in lemonade.
I don’t believe in numbers odd,
Or even numbers ; but
I try to put my trust in Ood,
And haven’t much to put.

Toowoomba (Q.) local optionists, led by

closing the worst half-dozen of the 39 local pubs.
However, despite ecclesiastical opposition, the
publicans won the day by 17 votes. They had

In giving evidence with respect to the
circumstances attendant on the violent death of
the woman Nolan in Howard-street, Sydney, a
female witness touched upon one of those subtle
distinctions which have exercised the minds of
generations. Asked whether one of the persons
in the case was drunk at a certain time, she
replied that he was “not so drunk.” This quali-
fication is exactly in the spirit of the author of
“ Auld Lang Syne ” :
We are no fou, we’re no that fou.
It was the same witness who drew the fine dis-
tinction between being knocked insensible and
toeing knocked “ slightly ” insensible. It may be
difficult for an intelligence of less refinement to
perceive any difference between a person being
slightly insensible and slightly sensible.

Dear Bulletin,—Andy Kelly, M.P., is
mighty solicitous about the hours of the poor
prison warders who have to watch a condemned
man. The divil take Count O’Kelly. Think of the
hours of the prisoner ! In my opinion, the man
who would take any of these billets for hire—
soldier, bailiff, process-server, debt-collector, pro-
fessional copman, turnkey, flagellator, executioner
—deserves no sympathy for even deathly hours.
It may be exhilarating to be a man-hunter; but
to be a man-hunter at so much per day ! Faugh !
And then to expect to be treated like a man!
I’d cheerfully hang the lot, but not for pay.—
Yours, The Dipsomaniac.

The late Robert Dixon, of Melbourne,
whose will is being contested on the ground of bis
alleged insanity, first made the acquaintance of
Mrs. D. in connection with Wesleyan Sunday-
school work. Poor Robert remained Wesleyan
always, whereas his wife became converted and
learned to love dancing, the result being matri-
monial Sheol for 25 years. There’s a very evident
moral to these Dixon disclosures. Choose a girl
who has had her share of fun before marriage, in
preference to the creed-bound virgin who will
begin to dance directly she gets rid of the Sunday
school. Also, don’t attempt to cure your wife of
going out to the dance by stopping at home your-
self and getting drunk. Go out likewise and
waltz with all the giddiest little things you can
get your arm round. Then the chances are ten to
one that the rebellious lady will learn to hate
ballrooms, and soon lead you back by the ear to
your own fireside.

“Poor Abigail!” says the parson-edited
Brisbane Telegraph; “that he alone should

ridden paper is an awful thing.
No wise patent-
medicine man ever
goes to law. When
he does, no matter on
what pretext, some
lawyer always rises
and asks him, on his
oath, if his nostrum
isn’t really composed
of aloes and gamboge,
or something like
that, and it takes six
months’ hard adver-
tising to do away
with the evil impres-
sion that results. In
Auckland (M.L.),
the other day, the
local agents for an
eminently successful
firm of British pill-
makers—one of those
firms whose pills are
a boon to the young
man who doesn’t feel
well, and the only
ones which can re-
move the disease that
comes stealing upon
usand produces symp-
toms akin to the above
—went into court
over a question of
Customs duty. Then
the solicitor on the
other side proved that
the gaudy medicine
was only made of
aloes and senna with
some flavouring
material thrown in,
and that anybody
could buy a barrel-
full of the precious
remedy at the nearest
chemists for about
4s. per lb., whereas
the patentees sold it
for something like
455., and the pill firm
seemed to be sorry it
spoke.
In a Southern Court, the other day,
a barrister begged that the hearing of a will-case
might be adjourned until next day, in order to
give him an opportunity of wading through a pile

His Honor, after some demur, consented to the
adjournment. “ I hope you will not think we are
wasting a day,” said the learned counsel, and his
Honor replied that he was sure the learned bar-
rister wouldn’t dream of wasting a day. He was
right—judges are never wrong. Two or three
hours later that barrister was seen on the race-
course backing a supposed “dead-bird” (which
didn’t come off) for the Handicap Trot. The
question seems to arise just here -is a case ever
postponed, at cost of money, time, and wear and
tear of anxiety to the poor devils of litigants, in
order that counsel may attend a pigeon-match ?

A picture of the “New Australia” region,
from the New York Mercury :
The sun, drooping to the horizon, threw his fiery rays
upon a burning sky and an almost boundless plain. The
parched earth was covered with a yellow dust. This
monotonous and melancholy pampa extends from the
confines of Patagonia to the suburbs of the city of Buenos
Ayres, spreading across many hundred leagues. There
was no spring, no verdure, no oasis in the desert. Not a
tree save the ombu, which is found in solitary state at
long intervals, and which is useless for either construction
or fuel; knotty and twisted, it resists the axe, and after
it is broken extinguishes the fire already kindled. When
the rainy season gives place to Summer, the ardent rays
of a sun never hidden or softened by the slightest clpud
burn to dust the hardy young leaves which have just
put forth. Not a drop of water in this dreary desert
except brackish or stagnant ponds, which were made by
the rains of winter, and which evaporate slowly in
infected odours. As far as the eye can see, the naked
plain touches the glassy horizon, sometimes deceiving the
traveller with the mirage so familiar to the Arabs of the
African Desert.
We begin to believe in the big land-grant now*
Almost any Government Would give away a big
slab of land like desert that is frozen in
winter, and burnt to ashes in summer, and full of
haggard melancholy all the year round.

globe-trotters and “receive” them by force of
arms. By persisting in this line, it has grown to
believe itself quite an important concern.
TREASURE TROVE.
1st. ROBBER (who has been exploring another part of the house): “Well,
Bill, what yer found? I aint got nothing!”
2nd. ROBBER: “Well, I haint got nothing, either, ’cept this ’ere blooming
love letter. It orter stand us in a bit if ever the old gal goes for a
divorce.”
Ellery s (Vic.) forecast for Nov. Ist (Cup
day): “ Victoria —generally dull, cairn, with some
clouds, light south-west wind.” Wragge’s ditto:
“Victoria—overcast, heavy clouds, with heavy
showers and rain imminent near coast, wind east.”
Punters, to their sorrow, know now which was
correct.

Last week a wan female was arrested at
Newcastle for haunting the premises of the A. J.S,
Bank. She used to meander in at all hours,
and hysterically demand an interview with an
official, who, she stated, had promised to marry
her. Medical examination failed to discover any
trace of insanity, and she was accordingly dis-
charged. She was formerly employed as a domes-
tic at the bank.
* * *
In the simple language of the telegraph-
wire :
The officers returned the fire, and for some time the
bullets rained. No one was wounded, but a dog was
afterwards found dead near the spot.
And this is journalese for two Melbourne detec-
tives exchanging shots with two suspicious char-
acters ! “ Bullets rained ! ” Why, even the dog
died of the mange.

Stead now wants an Act of Parliament
compelling all parents cursed with boys only to
adopt at least one girl, and vice versa. In that
case, could one of the boys marry this adopted
sister, according to Stead ? It hardly- matters •
probably he’d know her so well he wouldn’t want
to. But what of those married people who have
no children?. Would they be expected to adopt
both a boy and a girl ? If so, this would make
marriage more hideous than ever.

A ukase, in a Melbourne newspaper office
forbids reference to any offender as a Jew.
THE ROYAL BABY.
Away across the billowy brine, in distant Germanie,
A mighty monarch holdeth sway beside the Baltic Sea;
No common mortal William is—nor made of common clay;
He is the pet of Providence—whate’er the scoffers gay.
He never wets his whistle, as do vulgarians vile,
But quaffs celestial nectar in a proud, Olympian style ;
He never eats his victuals, as we common earthworms do;
He gets ambrosia from the gods—and wit and wisdom,
too.
It chanced, of late, a baby came to cheer the monarch’s
life ;
We thought that William woufd proud, and so would
William’s wife ;
But, how we stood astounded when we heard his message
read—
“ The Lord has given me a girl,” the modest monarch
said.
No credit to the pater, and no credit to mamma,
For royal babies are not born as common babies are;
(You look surprised ? Well—yes—we’ve heard of wisdom
from on high,
But—bless us all!—whoever heard of babies from the sky?)
Away ye vulgar infants of the fat and fiery face !
Away ye bald anomalies—ye badges of disgrace!
Be silent, all ye pug-nosed pets 1 for now the poet sings
Of babies bright from realms of light, with haloes and with
wings.
Away—ye puling parents, with your darling in your
arms !
Away with all your doting talk about its little charms 1
Go—gaze on William’s baby in its little royal bed,
Then drop your infant down the sink—and hide your
guilty head.
P. LUFTIG
Well, I dunno. I s’pose it is ;
Seems parsons in the market’s riz !
It also shows unto the earth
What pardon from a parson’s worth.
I sorter heard this Laseron
Had Walker’s buzzim fell upon.
It seems ’twas all a bit of kid,
’Cos now he wants two hundred quid.
If I were Thomas, I should say,
“I’ll raise the wind right straight away,
And pay this rev’rend gen’man up,
And go hack to the rosy cup !
Which must have missed my constant thirst
And odd-and-even kind of burst.
This lets me out ! If owt is bad,
Why I’m the feller that’s been ‘ had !’
To join the goats and leave the sheep ?
I think two-hunderd quid is cheap !”
THE DIPSOMANIAG.
CORRESPON DENCE
tio notice will he taken of communications which arrive
at this office insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must in every case appear on MS.
“Papyrus ” (Jihdeha): The wbman who adVet-
lises “ tenders wanted for repairs to Mrs. Smith” isn’t a
novelty. Doesn’t every parson profess to morally repair
his congregation by tender, and doesn’t the chtirch-gber
pay his pew-rent so as to have his conscience half-soled
and his heavenly prospects heeled ?,... “ G.D.R.” (Bris-
bane); Too heavy, and news mostly stale “ Richard L.”
(Sydney): Most of the lines want to be adzed ...
“Elector”: Thanks.,.. “Island P.” (Port Douglas):
The paper states straight out that a magistrate and the
officers of a British man-o’-war stole Sir Wm. M’Gregor’s
watch. What of that? Another British man-o’-war stole
a whole archipelago the other day “ Anglo-Tas-
maman : German common law permits morganatic mar-
nages, but only in the case of a nobleman marrying a
woman of inferior rank. The morganatic wife generally
takes some title which doesn’t commit her husband. The
husband s name and property don’t descend to the
children ; they' generally take their chance...." Etangata
roa ”; Only a sad, little autumn poem of the faded
flower and fallen leaves order.... “ The Shadow ” : “What
are you to do?” We don’t know! Couldn’t the diffi-
culty be settled by a duel with pigs’ feet at ten paces?....
“ John R.” (Marrickville): The beautiful dying boy who
has hymns sung at his bedside is too dreadful. . “H'R.C.”
(Marrickville): A poor, mechanical imitation of Besant's
“ Revolt of Man.” Any Chinaman can turn out that kind
of literature with a hay-fork,... “Daddy ” (Potts Point) ■
Too flimsy and superficial. That sort of sketch has been
done so often that only a genuine artist can put anything
new into it...." A.T.W.” (Brighton, Vic.): Thanks
“ Junius ” (Ad.): We don’t care for Zola and water....
“ T. 8.” (Harris Park): Subject written up by “ Dipso-
maniac” some time ago ...“ More ” (Brunswick): There
is always a rush of ghost stories at this season, and yours
is the last phantom which breaks the editor’s back....
“ T.O’S.” (Waverley 7): Why has Tub Bulletin “ such a
down on the Freetrade party?” Well, it is partly on
account of the thing that porous-plasters are good for,
and partly owing to the same cause (hat makes the dog
next door bark at night ... “A Depositor” : We haven’t
any animosity against the land-boomer in question. All
we say is that he deserves a big monument, and it should
be put on top of him at once . .“Barney”: Will con-

“A. 1 ” (No address): Half-a-column occupied in stating
that the fowls got 1005 e... “Xerxes”: Don’t attempt
satire. A gate-post and a bull-pup are your natural
weapons... ..“Thomas C.J.” (Kiama): Will use
“ S.S.A.” : You can only ask your faithless girl to return
in this paper at advertising rates in the lost-dog column.
. . .“VV.R.” (Cargo): Humour is no good unless
it humorous. Most humour isn’t humorous
‘ Misocant : Tale of the shot preacher whose life-blood
dropped heavily from tlie pulpit on his best parishioner’s
bonnet, is hereby declined Why bra ” : It is ail dis-
gusting butchery from the first page to the last. Come
round and take away the reeking offal “ Hiram Abiff ”:
W hat on earth possessed you to send us a sermon, with a
full-blown hunk of scripture on top and a “fifthly, me
dear bretheren” at the end?... “Tinpot”: The horse
and cart which clears a six-wire fence was an old, blind
lie on crutches away back in the Fifties “W.8.M.”
(Geelong): We won’t stand the “blood and sweat”
variety of poem any longer. We also object to “ Workers,
arise 1” “The blood of the wage-slave,” and a lot of other
tilings, of which we are making out a list ~ “W;B.Y,”
(Sydney); “Verses of Society with Moral” are pretty
steep. Your screed without the “moral” must be a
leprous affair ....“The Pauper”: A judicial flogging
never makes good verse somehow. The poet alw’ays gets
sluck looking for a rhyme for “bleeding back,”..,
“A. B. Bull : No— “ Ohilde Harold”: Reads like
Byron and Zachariah Sutcliffe mixed... “C. A. Thomas ” •
Your handwriting is exactly like the rush of the scrip-
tural hogs down a steep place into the sea, only you have
inked the hogs... “Ajax, alias Salt Junk”: You think
Dibbs should have given value for bis £lOOO by “con-
ciliating” the British capitalist. Tub Bulletin thinks
that if Dibbs has spent £lOOO in getting dead tired of the
British capitalist it is the one redeeming feature in the
business “G.S.”: You forward a column of rhyme
and say you “ don’t mean it as poetry.” Ho
you mean it as food, then—or clothes? “No.
170 (Melb.): Editor Fitchett savs, in bis pious
paper, that Melbourne Telegraph went bung through the
apathy of the pious classes, and in his worldly 7 paper that
it burst through the greed of the bloated compositor. It
did neither ; it died through the Cimmerian dreariness of
fitchett.... “E. Myddleton ”: Not likely to be true. If
true, not likely to be known “J.E.F.”: Tremblingly
done : would only serve as a subject for reproduction.”.
“Smithfield” (Q.): The remarks made by the Cairns
(Q.) Post concerning Tub Bulletin’s comments on the
Gleeson and Moncado cases are absolutely irrelevant to
the issue raised, which concerned not the charaeters-of
the lately-executed men, but merely the legality of accept-
ing the sworn (and subsequently retracted) evidence
of one com icted and capitally sentenced murderer
against another man then on his trial ... “ Xox ” ; If he
didn’t tell y 7 ou, with a loud and unwavering voice
that he knows all about Sheol and its trimmings, you’d
‘sack him. He has to: it’s part of his business
“ W.E.H.’ (Albany 7, W.A.): Thanksfor Labour pamphlets.
....“Optic”: We object to poetry with “forsooth” in
it—“ Evan J.”; A stereotyped incident. And again,
supposing you are giving us real names... “Fitz.B.”-
Sorry unavailable.... “ Solid Facts ” : Good. Name and
address, please. We would hear from you again....
“ Henry B. : The fact that you “ have had some pieces
published in the Sydney Mail is a ghastly introduction to
The Bulletin. Do you send us “Kangaroo Jack”
because it contains too much rum and excitement for the
Fairfax family?. ...“Anxious J.” : Now, who are you?...
“Invisible”: After release they, of course, can sit in
Parliament.... “ Louis L.”; Sorry to say we simply don’t
know..-., “ H.8.R.” :We have already had a set of verses
on the subject from the same text, and, curiously enou<di
with the same refrain... “Lolo.”: If America turned
Freetrade, to-morrow, wouldn’t it be more profitable for
Australia to follow America’s (and England’s) past
examples of building-up and growing-up? The more
Freetrade countries there are the merrier for us while we
remain protective ; and until the international centre of
percussion is reached, so that Australia shall, even with
Freetrade, be on equal terms with any and every other
nation, we have additional incentive to remain protective
“Busy Bee”: Hebraic anecdote is now mellow
enough for the Bits series. We wish it a long and
prosperous career ...“Guess”: You are shockingly
irreverent.

A Brisbane exchange, referring to the
Yankee Dr. Pierson’s rivalry for the London
Tabernacle pulpit with poor little Tommy
Spurgeon, the Auckland (M.L.) parson, points out
that it was a little too much to expect that a
people nursed in the belief that infant baptism
was superstitious would calmly accept as their
spiritual leader “ a child-sprinkling Presby-
terian.”
Frenchy, a well-known aborigine north of
Adelaide, thus gained his sobriquet: For, five
shillings given by an incredulous group of bag-
men, he took a run and smashed a hole through a
wooden door with his head. When the applause
had subsided, and Frenchy had drunk his ale, he
eloquently remarked : “Me show you plurry good
ting. You give him me two butcher beer, me
drive him nail in blanky board alonga my head-
front ” —and he tapped his head knowingly.
They agreed, and having procured a “F ren ch ”
nail, four inches long, he pegged away with his
forehead until it was flush with the bar-counter.
They gave him best.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
At the recent Q.T.C. meeting, a horse called
Orator paid the dividend of €159 ss. for a sovereign.
He had previously run unplaced in a race at a pony meet-
-111'-'. Queensland orators are equally deceiving, whether
they run on four legs or two.

In a cricket-match near Newcastle, N.S.W.,
last week, the middle stump Was knocked out of the
ground without disturbing lie bails. “Not out,” said
the umpire. Inspection showed that the bails (a new set)
were glued together, and had been placed on the wicket
in that state.
# # *
A. H. Gee, “Australian Foil,” of Melbourne,
backed Glenloth for Caulfield Cup, and told a friend whom
he laid on to it that at any rate they’d bo:.h back him for
the Melbourne Cup. Gee forgot, and the friend made a
big haul. Unsafe to talk Cup to Gee now.
* * #
John Corlett is responsible for the statement
that Joe Thompson lost £6O 000 over last year's Cam-
bridgeshire, trying to show English motallicians how to
do it Joe is very quiet now in London. ■
# # *
Chaffey Baker, C.M.G., the Atlas of the S.A.
National Ass, only had confidence enough in his dream of
Glenloth to win £4O on him.
# # *
Jonathan Brown, so long the superintendent of
garden arrangements at Flemington course, is dead and
buried. Glenloth’s awful Cup Day administered the last
shook to poor Jonathan.
# # *
Portsea, of course, was. certain to have w.on the
Melbourne Cup— if he hadn’t fallen. The horse, just like
G’Naroo last year, was passing the others with the
greatest ease. For a real racing certainty (bar accidents)
commend us to the “ dead bird ” that tumbles down.
* # *
Years ago in England a punter couldn’t go far
wrong at backing Stockweil’s “ get ” in all big weight-for-
age races. Trenton seems to be popping up into the
dtookwell of Australia. What’s the fancy price about
Trenton being the sire of the next A J.C. or V.R.C. Derby
winner ?
# # *
A EJemington-flat bookmaker got three months
with hard labour for eluding the pursuit of a woman who
took 20 half-sovereigns to 1 about Glenloth for the Cup.
A man who couldn’t do the square thing by Glenloth
must have been the welshiest of welshers, and no mistake;
But if the law is going to put down betting, why should it
not put in gaol that woman as well as the rascal she
gambled with? Why should the law give any measure of
protection at all to the taker of the odds?
* * *
Playing at Norton’s Summit (S, A.), Jack Lyotls
the other day made 101 runs in 38 minutes for the Nor-
woods. His score included 6 fives and 13 fours. This
must be about tile record.
# * •
Sir Edwin Smith, M.L.A., the wealthy Ade-
I ude brewer, is moving heaven and earth to induce George
Giffen to finally promise to join the next Australian
Eleven. Sir E Twin says if George promises to go, he will
go himself. Gillen promises to “seriously consider the
matter.”
* * *
South Australia will be strong in this year’s
interprovincial cricket contests. Besides the Giffens,
Lyons, Blimnan, and the other cracks, who are in great
forth, there are soiri? splendid younger players; Fred.
Jarvis, the Wicketkeeper’s brother, is batting better than
anyone in Adelaide just now. Reidman has made over
200 nliis in three innings, and Martin (a junior, who has
been watched for some time) in ide 90 last week. Those
Who have watched George Giffen at practice say he is
hatting better this year than ever in his life. So far he
has only had one innings—ls not out.
# * *
Jack M’Leau, the well-known sculler, now has
a pub. at Goraki, N.S.W. He still pulls—beer. Fulfilled
his destiny.
# * *
Is the Caucasian played out in Australia ?
Ah Mouy lately undo top score for the Avenue C. 0., Mel-
bourne, a leading junior, and “Darky ” Banks is captain
of the Fitzroy football team.
# * *
“Smiler,” a gentleman of infinite advertise-
ment, hobs up in Adelaide with his beautiful mug as a
frontispiece to the Australian Sportino News, which he
now edits. The man who tries to boom a paper by
advertising himself damns the show straight away.

Splendide, the four-year-old mare, which won
the Queensland Cup last week under the thumping weight
of9st. 21b., is little more than a pony. She was bought
as a yearling for 30 guineas, and has since won over £3OOO
in stakes alone.
« * *
The Griffo-Denny sham-fight had the effect of
keeping people away from the Dunn-Creedon a
genuine enough affair, wherein the splendidly-built
Oreedon, who flights d la Choynski, knocked out Dunn in
the middle of the second round. Creedon now goes to
America, where he will win battles. But the writer
hardly thinks he will be “in it” with Fdtzsimmons or
Hall.
THE TEETH AND THEIR CONSERVATION.
We desire to call attention to the dental practice of Mr.
J. I. Marshall in the Sydney Arcade, George and King
streets. He is the author of that popular treatise on
“The Teeth,” and his is also the only large firm in Aus-
tralia that is practising High-class Dentistry at Reform
Fees. Artificial Teeth are set on gold, silver, platinum,
vulcanite, zyonite, &0., from £5 the full set. Consulta-
tions are free. Teeth are extracted under pure nitrous
oxide gas or cocaine, daily. Only address-Mr. J. I.
Marshall, dental surgeon, Sydney Arcade, George and
King streets.*
FUNNY IRISH BLUNDERS.
The native of the Green Isle who said, “It’s
a great comfort to be left alone when your
sweetheart is with you,” and the Irish auctioneer
who, while praising some goods he was offering
for sale, exclaimed, “These are just the things I
should like to buy for my wife if she were a
widow,” made very witty bulls. Equally good,
but even more complicated, was that perpetrated
by the exile in America, who pathetically ex-
pressed himself thus : “Sure an’ if I live till I die,
an’ God knows whether I will or not, I’ll visit
ould Oireland afore I lave Philadelfy.” A funnier
blunder still, was that made by a new-chum
Hibernian, who was a passenger by the Southern
Express the other night. He alighted, with other
thirsty souls, at Mittagong, but lingered at the
bar, over his favourite nectar, longer than lie
should, and only regained the platform in time to
see the tail-lights of the train by which he intended
to have journeyed, receding from his view. For
a moment he was dumb with astonishment, and
then collecting all the energy and presence of
mind he was capable of exerting, he cried, “Hould
on there, ye blatherin’ engine ; faix, there’s a man
on board oi yo that’s left behind ! ” These
stories have all the true Irish ring about
them, and call up memories of the Irishman
who complained to his physician that he
“ gave him so many drugs he was sick a long
time after he got well.” No one who has used
St. Jacobs Oil can make a similar complaint to
that; it never causes a man to “feel sick after he
is well.” St. Jacobs Oil is an external remedy
for the absolute cure of pain, and it leaves no ill
effects behind. After using it the rheumatic
patient leaves his bed, or throws away his crutches
and begins life again a new man. Hear what Mr.
F. W. Kirby, of Mort-street, Balmain, says about
it; — “I use St. Jacobs Oil for rheumatism, and
do not know what I should do without it. The
kind of Work I aiU engaged in compels me to be
out in all weathers, and I often have to remaiii in
wet clothes for hours together. The result is that
I get rheumatism badly in my back at times. I
find there is nothing eqtial to St. Jacobs Gil fol*
shifting it, and putting me all right again. Both
my wife and I look upon it as a real blessing.”
The Voluntary testimony of thousands of such
witnesses proves that this marvellous remedy
possesses the confidence of all classes of the
community.

The Thief.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Among the wild fowl of Maoriland, the Maori-hen
and the pukaki are distinguished by their love for
glittering, objects. Like the ostrich, these birds
swallow such things as an aid to digestion. In
fact, you are almost certain to get a gold “pros-
pect ” in the crop of either bird.
On the great, lonely, southern track, which
winds through the western forest, parallel to the
ocean beach, two men were camped. They were
diggers, and returning home one evening with
about half-an-ounce of gold in the tin dish, they
placed the dish outside, and prepared for supper.
The fire was lit, and the johnny-cakes nearly
cooked, when Bill went out to get the gold. It
was gone. He asked his mate what he had done
with it. The latter denied having seen it. In-
vestigation resulted in nothing.
Suspicion breeds dislike, dislike soon becomes
hatred, and hatred is the forerunner of open
quarrel.
George was getting his sister out from home,
and he swore that Bill should never have her.
Words were freely bandied about. With mut-
tered growling each murmured recklessly, “Good
night, thief!” and turned in.
Towards three o’clock a.m. Bill dreamt that
Satan was crawling along the ridge-pole of the
tent. He awoke with a start. The flickering
gleams from the smothered fire showed movements
in the potato bag. Cautiously creeping out, he
grasped the head of the sack, and, with a shout of
triumph, roused George, with the assurance that
he had caught the thief. It was a Maori-hen.
The bird was despatched. The gizzard was
washed in the tin-dish. The result was half-an-
ounce of gold. The men grasped each other’s
hands and were friends again. The story ends as
all decent stories end, by Bill marrying George’s
sister shortly after her arrival.

The Knot of Blue and Gray.
Upon my bosom lies
A knot of blue and gray ;
You ask me w'hy. Tears fill my eyes,
As low to you I say :
“ I had two brothers once,
Warm-hearted, bold, and gay ;
■They left my side. One wore the blue.
The other wore the gray.
“ One rode with Stonewall and his men
And joined his fate to Lee ;
The other followed Sherman’s march
Triumphant to the sea.
“ Both fought for what they deemed the right
And died with sword in hand ;
One sleeps amid Virginia’s hills,
And one in Georgia’s sand.
“ The same sun shines upon their graves ;
My love unchanged must stay ;
And so upon my bosom lies
The knot of blue and gray.”-

The case of the Broken Hill defence
committee brings to mind that of the six Dor-
chester labourers, sentenced in 1834 to seven years
transportation, ostensibly for “ administering un-
lawful oaths,” but really for “ the crime of com-
bination.” Excitement was tremendous and
a demonstration in Copenhagen Fields (London)
was attended by 400,000 persons, and a procession
therefrom, between six and seven miles long, bear-
ing a petition of over 266,000 signatures, pro-
ceeded to the official residence of Lord Melbourne,
then Premier, to urge on him their release or the
remission of their sentences. After long delay on
the part of the Whig Ministry (backed up by the
manufacturers) the men were pardoned, but as,
according to Howell, they had on arrival at
Sydney been sold into slavery at <£l a head
(“assigned,” probably) years elapsed before they
heard of their pardon.
Writes a well-known Queensland politician
to The Bulletin
Now that Griffith has taken the Chief Justiceship, it is
likely that politics here for the next few months will in-
crease in interest to outsiders. We are certainly approach-
ins a most peculiar crisis. M'llwraith has left the province,
and wilt probably remain away until the crisis is over.
Nelson, the leader of the bogus Opposition, is spoken of as
next Speaker if the present dominant faction come out on
top at the general election. Morehead and Dickson are
both bidding hard for the vacant portfolio in the present
Government. Morehead has been appointed to go with
Griffith (who will not assume office for several months)
to the Federal Council and is on that account re-
garded as first favourite. The chances of the real Opposi-
tion winning at the election and putting a stop to black
labour and the ghastly land grant swindles, depend, I
think, on Lilley. The country could be roused, but it
requires a man with a name, leisure, and means to lead.
The Liberal party has been so starved of good men for
years past that when Griffith went over to the enemy no
one wag left who could step into his place. The labour-
party, though full of fiery enthusiasm, want constantly to
be reminded that alone they cannot do anything, and that
a policy of isolation is fatal. If Lilley (who, as you will
have seen, says his health does not permit of his entering
politics at present) came out a party would form round
him and might easily carry the election ; but whether he
would be able to keep a party together is another matter.
Marupa, the People’s
Friend.
Without question the medicines most sought
after now-a-days are those of Mother Mary Joseph
Aubert, and deservedly so, from what is heard of
their high merits everywhere. In nearly every
ease where a trial has been given relief has almost
immediately ensued. The testimonies of people
in various social positions have been forwarded to
the proprietor, and each asserts that the remedy
has truly marvellous qualities.
While that brilliant young actress, Miss Myr
Kemble, was in Wellington her voice became sa
hoarse that she was in some fear she would bo
imperfectly heard from the stage that eveninge
but Marupa was recommended, and the effect was
wonderful, she states in her testimony. ,
Mr. Walter Bentley had a similar attack, and
was afforded relief by a dose of Marupa.
Mother Mary Joseph Aubert has devoted nearly
all her life to the study of medicine. In Paris she
studied in the leading hospitals for five years, and
when she came out to New Zealand her love of
the science prompted her to commence research
among the herbs and flowers of the primeval
forests which Nature has so richly endowed our
colony with, and after 12 years of patient investi-
gation, her efforts were crowned with success and
her remedies gratefully acknowledged to be the
best and purest medicines ever offered.
They are now being introduced in Australia,
and are having the same success there as they
have met here. Mr. Kempthorne has opened a
branch in Sydney and is putting up the medicines
as fast as be can.
Meanee, Sept. 14, 1891.
Dear Sister, —I am too thankful to have the
opportunity of testifying to the genuineness of
your medicines, having given up all hopes of ever
getting better, until a friend brought you to me,
when four small bottles of your medicine cured
me, and what is more, I have been a stronger man
ever since. That was in July, 1882.
Henry Painter, senr.
Meanee, Sept. 30, 1891.
Messrs Kempthorne, Prosser and Co.
Gentlemen,— -Having used Sister Joseph’s medi-
cines for over 12 years, I can honestly say that
they cannot be surpassed.
I have seen a number of hopeless cases brought
to her and cured. She is the best, kindest, and
noblest of ladies, and never made any charge to
rich or poor, nor did it matter to what denomina-
tion you belonged you had the same kindness
shown you.
My own daughter, eleven years of age, met with
an accident, and although some of the best doctors
in Hawkes Bay despaired of saving her life, Sister
Joseph never gave up, but worked hard day and
night, and, thank God, saved her life.—Yours, &c.,
M. Young.

Mr. H. Owen, one of our local chemists, certifies
in our columns to the benefits derived from the
use of Mother Mary Joseph Aubert’s remedies.
It is evident there is a great future before these
purely local vegetable medicines, and which we
hear are now about to be introduced into New
South Wales, Victoria, and the other Australian
Colonies, and will bring the name of New Zealand
very prominently before the public of the Southern
Continent, and be one of the best advertisements
for this Colony. The proprietor deserves success
from the spirited way in which he has entered into
this enterprise.

A Flattering Testimony. —In our advertising
columns will be found copy of a letter addressed
by Lord Onslow to Dr. de la Bachoue, the French
Consul in Wellington, in the course of which his
Lordship bears testimony to the efficacy of the
medicines manufactured by the Rev. Mother
Mary Joseph Aubert. These remedies are ex-
tracted from New Zealand plants, and Lord
Onslow states that he has found them perfectly
satisfactory and really tonic and fortifying.


The Fitzgerald Bros. (Tom and Dan) and their celebrated pony, “ Commodore,' the bed-rock of
their fortunes and a friend in need.
TOM FITZGERALD.
DAN FITZGERALD.
Thls narrative (if the Fitzgerald Brothers
and their circus experiences was fully corro-
borated by the pony, who has kindly con-
sented to stand for his portrait in The Bul-
letin. Commodore 'often nodded approv-
ingly as the two young Australians told their
yarn to the writer, and only once did Com-
modore betray an inclination to kick. That
was when the noble animal thought Brother
Tom was exaggerating financial facts. Dan
and Tom Fitzgerald, it appears, started life
as the proprietors of a little show styled
“ The Three in One ” circus, with which for
a while they travelled Austra-
lia and Maoriland, waxing in
wisdom and in “ strength.
Bad weather eventually over-
took the “Three in One” enter-
prise, and in the sultry dis-
trict of Charleville (Q.), 800
miles from Brisbane, the boys
sold the plant to pay their
liabilities and felt that the ways
of Providence are inscrutable.
Tom retired to Brisbane, and
had just relieved his feelings
with an attack of sickness, when
brother Dan wrote him to come
out into the wilderness with
his violin, whereupon Thomas
packed up the fiddle and re-
joined his relative. Being
now a long distance from no-
where, and lacking the cash
necessary to transport them-
selves, six horses and the “mas-
cotte ” Commodore to any
centre of population by rail,
they plodded overland to
Bourke, and there raised suffi-
cient wind to waft them to
Sydney.
They knocked together a new
show’, consisting of Dan, Tom,
young Duckworth, Commodore,
the six horses, a performing
goat and a waggon, and set
out to ravage the land of
their birth. Dan used to pre-
pare the meals of kangaroo,
native bear and other delicacies, while
brother Tom, who was (and is) addicted
to low-cut skirts and cravings after the
Infinite, acquired the art of “ washing-up,”
Commodore, without being asked, made a
point of wiping the utensils with his trusty
tail, and would have cooked a wallaby if
they had let him.
The first performance of this Greatest
Combination on Earth took place on a
station. The Brothers, after getting permis-
sion to camp, formed themselves into a
deputation to wait upon the rouseabouts and
arrange the price of a show Seven “ bob ’
a head being fixed as a reasonable charge for
admission, the inauguration of Fitzgerald
Bros.' new circus took place. They rigged a
piece of side-wall with, canvas, formed a
ring, and started to paralyse the public. The
entertainment opened with a four-horse act
by Duckworth (his vhaiden effort ill that
line), assisted by the strains of Tom's fiddle.
Tom, being limited to one tune, was found
to have a prejudicial effect upon the act, so
Professor Dan desired the orchestra to cease,
and the result was a veritable triumph.
Commodore was the next item on the bill.
He’s an amiable beast, and for some time he
tolerated the fiddle for the sake of the honest
hand that scraped it, but at last he
walked to the scene of the disturbance
on his hind - legs and removed the
everlasting melody with his teeth. Sub-
COMMODORE.
sequently Commodore sat upon the fiddle
and the band played never again. The
wdiole performance of this gifted pony carried
the audience by storm, and when the circus
departed with proceeds amounting to £7 the
cheers of an admiring populace rent the air.
The Fitzgeralds worked along through the
wilderness, without a band, ever finding
fresh cause-to love Commodore and magnify
his name. They have a proud recollection
of a certain “pitch” on Ounnamulla race-
course, where Tom (after a struggle with his
feelings) and took the shillings at the
entrance to the tent, and Professor Dan
climbed in tactile waggon and thumped a
kerosene tin. On this memorable night they
took £l5, and began seriously to think of
getting drunk. Anyway, they were getting
on.
Crossing couiitry to a place called lT!o
they there picked up the little darkie boy,
Harry Cardells, whose equestrian acts have
become features in the present show. By
the time they got near Bourke again they
were sufficiently flourishing for brother T<>m
to rush along as “ advance agent ! and bill
the town. The largest circus of modern
times was about to arrive. The waggon
crept into Bourke under cover of darkness,
the tent was fixed up, and the show, at 3s.
and 25., astounded the proprietors by going
straight to the local heart. Commodore’s
performance alone was declared to be cheap
at the price. Blessing Bourke and the
friends they found there the Fitzgeralds
pegged along to various places, and ter-
minated their back-block trip at Gunnedah,
with £5OO to the good. From that peaceful
township Tom Avent to Sydney and sang at
Sunday night concerts, the “ screw” helping
to keep Professor Dan and the ’osses while
he was breaking-in and training the raw
material, in readiness for a fresh start.
They made a fresh start, and have never
looked back since.
Enlarging their show from time to time as
they went along they travelled all over the
place, and put up some truly remarkable
records. For instance, their first visit to
Broken Hill brought them a solid profit of
£l5OO, and at their second visit they pulled
£350 into the tent on a Boxing-Night. At
Albafly (W.A.) they ventured to ask six
and five shillings for front and back seats,
and the steepness of this tariff caused the
tent to be generally avoided on the opening
night. Dan Fitzgerald went through with
the performance before a handful of spec-
tators. and next night Albany come forth in
one vast mob and fought for tickets an hour
before the show was advertised to begin.
Sometimes, of course, the circus has been
pitched in regions which hadn’t a population,
places where the last nan had long since
succumbed to exhaustion, and on these
occasions even Commodore couldn’t achieve
a triumph. But the Fitzgeralds
tell extraordinary tales of how
they have often been able to
fetch big audiences from long
distances away, and have taken
as much as £250 i i places that
looked most unpromising.
Moreover, one believes the
history of the Fitzgeralds as
told by themselves. There is
a George Washington appear-
ance about these two indomit-
able young Natives to btg'n
with, and the seven months'
success of the show in Mel-
bourne testifies to its money-
making ability on tour. The
Australian Circus opened quite
unpretentiously in the city of the
busted boom, and madeanaraefor
its horsey excellence right away.
Dan Fitzgerald is a born
horse-trainer, a self-taught
genius at the business, and in
a little while his four - footed
pupils are as far advanced as
they can go. Sara Bernhardt’s
pair of not very promising-
looking carriage - horses were
bought by the Fitz’s more for
advt. purposes than for tricks
in the arena, but they have
been converted into star per-
formers. If Sara could only see
one of her discarded nags jump
—well, she would buy it back
again at a fabulous price and
make it jump for her amuse-
ment until the poor thing
dropped dead, Dan Fitzgerald
behaves like a judiciously affec-
tionate parent to all his horses,
but Commodore is the apple
of his. eye. In fact, the
Brethren, jointly and severally,
love Commodore with all their
heart, and the heart of the firm is big. That
pony founded their capital, and when, in
the fulness of time, it is gathered to its
ancestors, they will put the tent into mourn-
ing and feel very bad.
# * #
Meanwhile Commodore takes his corn
reg’ler, and talks (in his own way) of com-
ing along to Sydney with the Fitzgerald
Bros., their wonderful Bronchos, and glitter*
ing company of artists, Ac. (including the
inevitable “ funny clowns,” Avho happen to
be rather funny in this instance) at Christ-
mas. Commodore, who always takes The
Bulletin when he can get hold of it, will bo
glad to see such good portraits of himself
and his young old friends.

THE DIPSOMANIAC.
You needn’t ask Balmairiiac Clark, M.P.,
the teetotal £?od, to “shout.” He always does.
In a voice like a grater. So he probably takes
nutmeg with his’n.
The cabled employment c)f Cossacks to
repress revolts by Poles is a very old plan. The
Romans used the same device and kept Africa in
ordet with legions raised in what is now Austria*
while they held down Syria with legions enrolled
in Gaul and kept the Gauls id order with armies
levied in Greece or Italy. Napoleon long worked
the oracle the same way, and fell when he departed
from the plan of holding Germany with French
troops augmented by Italian and Spanish regi-
ments, while he had his Polish lancers in Spain
and Italy. When the Skye crofters defied the
police, the British Government hesitated to send
against them the troops which were nearest,
because these were Highland regiments, so they
sent marines. Ireland has always been kept in
hand by English and Scotch regiments, while
Irish brigades are used on foreign stations to
shoot niggers, or sometimes quartered in English
manufacturing towns. If ever the British should
attempt revolution, the Indian native troops will
be brought in to furnish a contingent to the
Royalist forces, and if Australia should attempt
to assert her independence, Sikhs, Ghoorkas, and
Sepoys would be employed to “ Fire low and lay
’em out.”
Four Labour - members have been ap-
pointed to the Legislative Council of Maoriland.
When the message from the Governor reached one of
them, Mr ; Jenkinson, boilermaker, Christchurch,
he was at work inside a boiler he was at the time
constructing.—
In ancient times one day the Romans found
Great Cinetnnatus,
Their “ Only General,” behind his plough,
Drilling—potatoes
(Then a new crop), when wanted to command
The mighty forces of the Roman land !
And now, from Maoriland we have the story
Of one, a brawny toiler,
Found, when his country called him to the Senate,
Inside an iron boiler,
Curled in position where he best could settle
Each rivet firmly in the sounding metal.
And as the Ploughman of the Roman State
Was ablest far
To lead her armies on to victories great,
In times of war,
So may the boiler-maker, Jenkinson,
As a statesman, prove to be our greatest gun 1
And help to rivet to our legal code
Laws to secure
That Justice shall be as an open road
To rich and poor ;
And hammer hard at every Social wrong
To bring in time the Perfect State along.
And as he made good boilers, may he now
Make laws as good,
That will hold water, and stand wear and tear
As those have stood.
And be himself what did himself environ,
When called to legislate—good, honest iron !

Fainting Range.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A long, low ridge that rises on the flooded Southern
side—
A smoothly-running ridge, it seems to reach the
Great Divide ;
The stunted timber tells you that the track is
clear and sound,
You can hear your footsteps ring upon the hard,
metallic ground.
The deep, dark gullies down below are lost amid
the trees
That tower up above the scrub and sway with
every breeze,
And he who knows the terrors of this trackless
sea of green
Will stop to rest and, lingering, gaze upon the
hopeless scene.
And as he journeys slowly on and climbs the
friendly rise
The dense, dark, waving field below will float
before his eyes,
And the gloomy picture holds him; wrapped in
reverie profound
Some mystic flowing current seems to lift him o’er
the ground.
It is then the voice should hasten that would speak
the warning word,
It is then the silence trembles lest the sleeper be
not stirred,
And the throbbing wakes the dreamer, and he
starts to note the change,
And stopping, stares bewildered down the top of
Fainting Range.
There are men, they say, who faltered, but, too
proud to wander back.
Unflinching faced the falling ridge and struck the
rising track—
Rising, flattening, falling, sinking, till they knew
not where to stir,
And then they dashed in madness down a never-
rising spur.
There are men amongst the travellers from the
open, boundless plain,
Where the stars at night will lead you o’er a land
that thirsts for rain,
They say the giant ranges ever mocked them in
their dreams,
And the hot wind onward sweeping urged them to
the running streams.
Tlie.e are men too weak to travel, who in restless,
fevered haste
Cared only that they left behind the dreary, level
waste —
They had no “eye for country,” and they never
knew the rise
In endless, broken, waving lino stretched to the
distant skies.
It is these and many others who have gone their
weary way,
And tempted by the troach’rous ridge their toll-
some task essay,
Stout-hearted even through the night their lonely
way have pushed
Till hope has died within them and the bravest
souls are “ bushed.”
They are ever moving past us—those who only
know defeat,
You will see them in the city, pass them in the
crowded street ;
You will see in fitful moments, marked in memory’s
mournful trace,
The long, heart-breaking stages painted on the
pallid face.
And should you meet a traveller who would reach
the Great Divide,
In pity strive to stay him till he scan the steep
straight side ;
It may be that you know no track, and all still
lingers strange,
But lift your voice in warning, ye who’ve tried by
Fainting Range 1

The King of Kaloona.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Micky Morphy is King, Pope, and Providence
at Kaloona, on the head of the Diamantina, one
of the latest formed townships in the Queensland
fat west. Kaloona consists of two pubs, (rum, a
shilling a nobbier) and two stores. Micky has at
least a say in all four places.
Micky is not a J.P., but he is Chief Justice of
Kaloona. He has a Napoleonic code of his own,
and from his judgment there is no appeal. He
can enforce his sentences, for he is the adminis-
trative head of both the Judicial and Penal
departments.
“Charlie the Barman” is Judge’s Associate,
and also the Sheriff’s factotum. He carries out
the law as pronounced by Judge Micky. Micky
has but one form of punishment for offenders—
he stops their grog.
The sentences vary according to the heinousness
of the offence, from 24 hours’ stoppage to as much
as seven days! And it is all “ without the
option.”
Listen to His Honor, dealing with an offender ;
“Noa! The devil a dhrap will ye get till to-
morry noight ! It was robbing yez, ye said I was.
The devil a dhrap till thin, and not thin, unless
ye behave. Block him, Charley !’’
The dread fiat has gone forth. Kaloona holds
no snakejuice “till to-morry noight ” for the man
who dared to affront Pope Micky !
“ Av they would only adopt moy law,” says
Micky, “all the jails in Queensland would be
impty in three months.”
Micky has his sorrows. He can’t “ rade roitin’,
an’ the printin’ do be puzzlin’ ” him. He is
rather “off” in general education, and is some-
what deficient in experience of civilised luxuries.
A big squatter called in at Kaloona recently,
and Micky, as Chief Commoner, invited Trotters
to dinner, determining to astonish him with some
of the wares out of his stores. So Micky went
over for a sample of preserved Californian fruit.
Returning, he placed a tin on the table, and re-
marked— “Oidoant know whidder ye be partial
to this brand uv fruit, sorr ?”
“ Fruit, Micky? Why, that’s oysters !”
“Isthers! Isthers ! TV divil a wan o’ me
knows if that’s as good as the Pache Brand or
not. K ut we’ll try the fruit anyway.”
JOG.
The latest snake-yarn protrudes from
Hamilton (Vic.), where a thrifty and providential
reptile was found with a larder of water-rats,
opossums, and 30 eels.
The Australian Star alludes to “ the
famous King John Sobieski, of Poland, the deli-
verer of Vicuna.” Vicuna is a sort of mud and
bark hamlet in the Andes, and we should fancy
Sobieski must have been pretty tired when he got
there.
Poets should never marry. The male
canary, when shut up with his mate, finds it im-
possible to sing, and so with the poet. There
have been exceptions, but they always get away
somehow from the “hen.” Burns either did'his
composing at the plough-tail, or left his “bonny
Jean” for the stock-yard and Souter Johnny.
Tennyson had many rooms to stow away in, and
was an indefatigable walker besides, as Parkcs
knows. Not one woman in a million can allow a
man to become absorbed in composition.
The Moderator of the Melb. Presbyterian
Assembly enquires: “What is the mysterious
power that uplifts a blade of grass in defiance of
the laws of gravitation.” We suppose it is the
same power that makes a man’s hair grow out of
his head instead of into his skull. How strange
that we never see anything mysterious about the
necessity of visiting the barber —until we get bald
and try hair-restorer in vain ! And just here it
occurs to us that grass grows all the thicker and
quicker for being pressed down and bruised when
the blades begin to stick out, so the Moderator
will please notice that Nature is not too proud to
accept a little human assistance. Why a fat man,
with large feet, should be a useful article on a
young lawn is one of the most mysterious things
going.
“The Dignity of Labour!” Some one
has just published, in England, a volume dealing
with the special diseases incidental to labour.
Among them are “chimney sweep’s cancer a
sort of leprous complaint connected in some
obscure fashion with soot, “baker’s thumb,”
“washerwoman’s hand,” “stonemason’s lung,”
“potter’s rot,” “hammerman’s palsy,” “flock
fever a complaint which carries off bedding-
manufacturers, “printer’s phthisis,” “brass-
founder’s ague,” “grinder’s rot,” “ poncy ” —a
weird complaint which cuts off linen - workers,
“shoddy fever,” and “miner’s consumption.”
Also, there are strange complaints incidental to
vitriol-workers—whose teeth, hair, and nails drop
out, oil refiners, glass-blowers, sugar refiners
who are afflicted, like the deceased Herod, with
curious insects inwardly, weavers, blacksmiths,
dyers, cutlery-makers, cotton-operatives, coal-
miners, iron-workers, brewers, and a multitude of
others. Almost every trade, in fact, has some
particular horror of its own, and some of them
have six horrors or more. The dignity of labour
isn’t what it is cracked up to be.

DTUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROWS
0 STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen ;
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the publi; to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
1 hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“ (Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt street.
Row’s Steanes Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti febrile is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S
DANDELION
BITTERS.
We recommed these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See wlxat a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
-Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30, 1880.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned :
“I have for many years be.en obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the;
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DAN D E LIO N
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect and change
in my system, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afflcted as I havo
been may take advantage of them.
“ I remain, dear sirs,
“Respectfully yours,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Yoil're a man df education and the morning of
your days
Has been cast in pleasant places or in literary
ikkys :
Well, you want to earn a living—’tis a thing you
have to do—
So you join the Daily Howler at a very modest
“screw.”
You will rise in your profession, so you reckon,
by-and-bye—
There’s an equal chance of rising vip to Heaven
when you die;
You will scribble weary leaders, and the subjects
of them !—Yes !
You must write on any subject when you’re
writing for the press.
You will write the Christmas stories and the
poems and the pars.,
You will hunt for new sensations and you’ll inter-
view the “stars”;,
You must know a bit of boxing, you hiust under-
stand the law,
For the “Cohen versus Moses” and the “one
Upon the jaw.” .
You must ground yourself in dogma, and on horses
aiid on “ pugs,”
On phyffdxei’d and cancer, and on aphis, bees and
bugs ;
You ’re supposed td be “acquainted ” and expected
to be ’cute
And to answer correspondence on theosophy or
fruit.
You’ll report the parson’s sernioilS rind the politi-
cian’s “views,”
You will be on hand at banquets and society
“shivoos,”
And your grammar must lie perfect and your
morals Op to date,
And your coming should be early, but your
must be late.
They will shriek at yoh for “ copy}” and despatch
you down the town,
Where you strike upon a subject, and they sweat*
and cut it down.
You may write a clever leader; aiid they sneer and
talk of “ school
You may write the way they Want you, and they
damn you for a fool.
You may hold your own opinions, and you hold
them dearly, too,
But the journal that you live on has a “ policy,
and you ?
Why, you batter those opinions for the things ymt
wear and eat,
And you sell your very virtue, like the Woman of
the street.
Then you join the “ fonVatd’’ movement, but
your faith begins to Hag-
Earning ten-and-six a column oil a democratic
rag.
You contribute to a paper, and the article you
write
Is completed in a garret, by a candle, late at
night*
You are writing for existence and you Write the
best you may,
So you “call around on Monday ” and the editor
. will say,
“We are sorry to reject it,” or, perhaps, if he’s a
brute, *
He will tell you very roughly “that the matter
doesn’t suit.”
And he hands you back your copy, and you grin
a meek “Good-bye,”
While your throat is pretty chokey and you feel
inclined to cry,
Then you take a nip of something, for it helps yoit
not to think,
And your life is not so happy that you make it
worse by drink.
Yes, I know you thought to sell it, and you did
your very best,
And you wrote it for one market, and ’tis useless
for the rest.
You had counted on acceptance, and your time is
gone to waste.
But you know you are competing with the scissors
and the paste.
Your wife at home is waiting, and she sadly needs
a dress,
But you’re going through the mill, mate, you are
xvriting for the press!
Well, the years have left you fighting, and your
youth is slipping by,
But you find, instead of resting, you must work
until you die*
Then, perhaps, your heart will fail you, or perhaps
before it breaks.
You may write a little story, half-despairing, and
it “ takes,”
Then you go up like a rocket and they pay you
what you ask,
Then you’ve “made your reputation” and ’tis
sunshine, and you bask !
Then the struggle is behind you, you forget it and
forgive,
For ’tis fame as well as money, and, by Heavens !
how you live ! !
