The Novelists of England
In the great firmament of English fictio
there are about SO interesting stars. Su
pose we attempt to chart that special fiel
We shall take no account of dead suns, no
shall we take as our standard of classifies
tion mere popularity, but solely the intri
sic wort'll of their fiction. And in makii
our map we shall attempt to indicate tl
direction of the evolution of the particula
stars —which stars are stationary in th
amount of light they send us, which star
are fading, which stars are increasing i
brilliance.
J*
First, there is the small ‘class of fixed
stars of the first fictional magnitude
Thomas Hardy, Henry James and Georg
Moore. Of these three conspicuous object
Hardy still glows enormous by the light h
has sent us in the past. After that tremen
dous outburst of energy, The Dynasts, h
has relapsed into fitful flashes of poetry
James shines with even brilliance, his ray
helping to add to the glory of many a mino
star. Moore has ceased to write fiction ex
cept about his own soul. But all three ar
fixed stars, Moore shining with a lesse
light. '
Next in order of fictional importanc
conies the fixed stars of the second magn
tude: H. G. Wells, Joseph Gonrad, Arnold
Bennett, May Sinclair. Spectroscopic ana
lysis shows that these four have not ye
reached their limit of possible brightness
With the possible exception of May Sin
clair, we may expect to receive from thes
stars more light than they have yet give
us. There is not this prospect from tw
other fixed stars of the second magnitude
Maurice Hewlett and John Galsworthy
Hewlett, though still a conspicuous objec
in the English sky, is steadily diminishin
in brilliance; while Galsworthy gives ev:
dence of changing the color of his rays int
other forms of light-—the essay and th
drama. Next come the stars that, fiction
ally considered, are already near death
Rudyard Kipling, Israel Zangwill anc
James Barrie. The ruddy, changing glar
of Kipling has died down, while the othe
two stars have changed their chemical com
position and become dramatic suns. (If w
were to look further afield, we could dis
tinguish in the United States firmament tw
stars of almost the same high magnitude
Ambrose Bierce and Edith Wharton —th
latter a slightly lesser light.)
J*
There is a curious group of small nebulae
which next needs notice. This group com
prises Max Beerbohm, G. K. Chesterton, R
B. Cunninghame Graham, and, perhaps
Hilaire Belloc. The nature of these nebu
lse is still open to speculation, though in
one, Chesterton, we recognise a declining
novelist, whose light filters through
thickening strata of religiosity ; and another
Beerbohm, seems in evolution toward a new
novelist.
The next group, however, though not at
present of equal interest, consists of stars
that flamed once in the English novelists
firmament, and as quickly disappeared
These novelists of one important book are
Olive Schreiner (The Story of an African
Farm), Mary Cholmondeley (Red Pottage)
Richard le Gallienne (The Quest of the
Golden Girl), Lucas Malet (The Wages of
Sin), Richard Dehan (The Dop Doctor)
Maxwell Gray (The Silence of Dean Mait-
land), Emma Brooke (The Superfluous
Woman), Sarah Grand (The Heavenly
Twins), F. Anstey (Vice Versa), George
Egerton (Keynotes). Of these only one, Olive
Schreiner, is of the second magnitude; the
rest are various and assorted.
Jl '
Now comes the class of stars that form
the majority of the English suns. These
are - the stars that still are plainly visible
but shine each successive year with de-
creasing brilliance. They are all under-
going a process of cooling. Among the stars
that were once of the second magnitude and
now are of third or fourth magnitude are:
J. C. Snaith, W. J. Locke, Beatrice Harra-
den, Mrs. Humphry Ward, Richard White-
ing, Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler, Robert
Ilichens, William de Morgan, Gertrude
Atherton, Jack London, Algernon Black-
wood, Marmaduke Pickthall. The rate of
cooling is not the same in all these stars.
Thus Snaith breaks out with a different-
hued glow every year, but the annual
totality of his rays is successively decreas-
ing in amount. Locke is an example
of a star that slowly grew from the
fourth magnitude to the second mag-
nitude, stayed in that class for a decade,
and then began his slow decline. Beatrice
Harraden blazed into sudden glory with
Skills that Pass in the Night, and as sud-
denly relapsed into a fitful red glow. Mrs.
Humphry Ward evidently passed through
a curious strata of the ether known as the
Victorian Age, only in which her brilliance
could have been apparent, and when her
orbit left that suitable environment she ap-
peared as a sombre and dull star. Yet there
is no sign of the slackening of her chast-
ened glow. Richard Whiteing reached his
most brilliant stage with No. 5 John Street,
but has rapidly diminished almost to in-
visibility. ,So Elizabeth T. Fowler swiftly
flared and faded. Robert Hichens remained
catalogued as of second magnitude for a longer
period, steadily growing brighter, especially
when seen through the rarefied atmosphere
of the Sahara, but his fall to the third and
then to the fourth magnitude immediately
followed. William de Morgan, though evi-
dently in chemical composition a star of
great age, by some' inexplicable internal re-
adjustment suddenly flung out great streams
of steady light; but the age of the star tells
us that the effort is a dying one. Jack
London and Gertrude Atherton, two stars
first observed in the United States, pro-
mised a permanent increase in brilliance,
but of late the slackening in their light-
energy is apparent. Algernon Blackwood
and Marmadulce Picktliall are stars of pecu-
liar hue, but though this still makes them
noteworthy objects in the siderial system,
their brilliance is now not so conspicuous.
C>f stars that at their period of greatest
brilliance reached only the third or fourth
magnitude, but have since relapsed into
even lower orders of brilliance, the following
list may be given: W. W. Jacobs, Jerome
K. Jerome, Barry Pain —all humorists of a
few books apiece, and all still producing
books not so humorous; Lloyd Osbourne,
Charles Marriott, Gilbert Parker, Eden
PhiUpotts, Mrs. Voynich, Mrs. Campbell
Praed, “Q.,” B. Paul Neuman, Flora Anne
Steele, Horace A. Vatchell, Marriott Wat-
son, Stanley Weyman, Dolf Wyllarde, Jef-
fery Farnol. Eleanor Glyn, Rider Haggard,
Anthony Hope, Ada Cambridge, Bernard
Capes, Robert W. Chambers, S. R. Crockett,
Conan Doyle, John Trevena.
This large list of stars whose secrets have
been already discovered is here printed, in
order that the fictional student should not
waste his time in the examination of what
further light these stars may yet have to
give us. Rather should he turn his tele-
scope to other regions of the sky where new
luminaries are steadily increasing in bril-
liance. The struggle for existence is going
on in the fictional world as fiercely as in
our own. The names of these decaying
suns are widely known, and the public finds
much virtue in a name. *
J*
Now for the new stars, already of the third
magnitude, and every succeeding year in-
creasing in brilliance. The list is small:
Oliver Onions (The Compleat Batchelor,
The Odd-Joh Man, Good Boy Seldom, Wid-
dershins, According to the Evidence, The
Dehit Account), Horace Walpole (Prelude
to Adventure, Fortitude), William Caine
(Hoffmann’s Chance), Elizabeth Robins
(The Magnetic North, Where Are You
Going To?), W. B. Maxwell (Mrs. Thomp-
son, In Cotton Wool), Alfred Ollivant (The
Royal Road), Anne Douglas Sedgwick (Val-
erie Upton, Tante), Compton Mackenzie
(Carnival), Gilbert Canaan (Round the
Corner) —all realists ; D. H. Lawrence (The
White Peacock, Sons and Lovers), James
Stephens (The Policeman’s Daughter, The
Crock of Gold) —both fantastics; A.
S. M. Hutchinson (Once Aboard the
Lugger, The .Happy Warrior) —a ro-
mantic ; and A. Neil Lyons (Arthur’s.
Clara), Leonard Merrick (Conrad in Quest
of His Youth, The Man Who Understood
Women)., Stephen Leacock (Literary
Lapses, Nonsense Novels, Sunshine Sketches
of a Little Town), George A. Birmingham
(Spanish Gold, Ijalage's Lovers) —new
humorists. These stars have sent out other
rays, but only the more characteristic of
their emanatiofis are charted. If the
student will carefully look out any fine even-
ing for the rise of these new stars, he us
promised much enlightenment and enter-
tainment.

Clyde M.: Maybe you think your already

Charles M.: I hope to be some day.
Clyde M.: I recognise your drift, you’d
like to evoke discord between father and I,
you've an evil motive in it.
Charles M.: What do you mean by an
evil motive.
Clyde M.: I mean you want a clear coast
to gain your own greedy ends.
Charles M. (seizes decanter from table,
and add) : you whipsnake I’ll kill you.
Clyde M. (wrests decanter from his
grasp, And resumes) : you coward. I’ll frash
you within an inch of your life.
Enter Mr. Mills Scn’r.
(Frowns at his son’s —and exclaims)
Mr. Mills Sen’r : Ruffians what’s the
meaning of this disorderly Conduct.
Charles M. (meekly) : Clyde insulted
me and I was About to chastise him, when
you entered.
Clyde M.: T’was he’s fault father, he’d
brained me with the decanter, had I not
wrested it from His frenzied grasp.
Mr. Mills Sen’r: I’m surprised at you
Charles, To forget yourself so far —as to
attempt an act of savage violence. Shake
hands the two of you, and never let me gee
illwill between you again.
(Brother’s shake hands cooly.)

Webb’s order early to morrow.
Charles : I’ll attend to it father.
(Exit Mr. Mills followed by Clyde.)

Charles M.: Justice is justice father, you
almost Accused Mary the servant of having
stole the Ring, which would man serious
trouble if she liked to go to law against you,
After you left the house last night to attend
your lodge meeting, I saw Clyde emerge
softly from your sleeping room, it may seem
wrong on my part, but Ive a strong sus-
picion, he planted the jewel here in his
clothes box.
Mlr. Mills Sen’r (with indignation) : you
must be Mistaken Charles. Clyde would
never give way to criminal Temptation, he’s
to upright:
Charles M.: Well we see-—while he’s
absent we have A good opportunity to seek
for the missing Treasure. ( overhawls Box—
and brings forth Diamond ring. smiles
grimly and resumes) Now father do you
believe your own eyes.
Mr. Mills (with a tremor of horror) ;
Abominable, he’s dead mother would rise in
her Grave if she knew this. I loved him
with My heart and soul, but I loathe him
now. And if t’was not that the disgrace
would leave a blot on our good name. I’d
hand him over to justice withodt mercy.
But the miscreant and I are stranger’s for
the future, he’ll leave my house to night.
For ever as God’s my witness.
(Burys his face in his hands and trembles.)
Charles M.: the young fool as been gam-
bling on the quiet of late, and maybe con-
tracted a debt among evil companions.

pause resumes) : Give me some Details of
your career during the last ten years, Clvde,
and how you came to be—Crippled for Life.
Clyde M.: With the money I had man-
aged to save —out of the wages allowed to
me by Father, I sailed to australia, where
I followed various occupations to eke out
an honest existence, after five year’s in vic-
toria, I grew weary of it, and joined a ship,
and after several trips to —distant ports,
I procured my discharge—and located in
New Zealand australia, where I worked for
a period, when I substained a severe Fall
which fractured my knee cap. I was borne
to the christchurch Hospital, from where I
emerged after weeks of sufferings a cripple
for life. I had a little money in the bank,
which I drew —and booked my passage back
to old England, and having learnt dear
father was dead, I took the liberty to call
and see you.
Charles M. (Regretfully ): I wfonged
and blighted your young life. Dear Brother.
But I solemnly declare by the Life of My
beloved Wife and child that I’ll make
amends, I’ll make amends.
Curtain.
The English Sneer meets many of our
efforts in literature. The Athenaeum
(London) was born with it. Here are three
recent pronouncements—certainly not upon
works of outstanding genius. Of Alex.
Gordon Steven’s The Witchery of Earth
(Robertson. Melb.) The Athenaeum says:
“Occasionally the author touches the real
noetic note, but mdeh of his work is com-
monplace in thought anjjl- execution.” Of
Fritz Hart’s Appassionata (Lothian, Melb.):
“We have nothing to urge, against the style
of these verses, which, indeed, is in places
almost distinguished. The author has a
musical ear and does not lack inspiration.
This is an example of the negative sneer, for
which this magazine is famous. Make the
criticism positive, and see what the critic
reallv means to say: “We like the distin-
guished style of these verses. The author
has inspiration and a musical ear. G r . ant
Hervey, author of Australians Yet (Lothian.
Melb.), naturally disagrees with the deli-
cate digestion of The Athenaeum: these
verses display little more than a capaci
for stringing rimes. They are patriotic eve
to riotousness in intention, but they re
like debilitated parodies of Mr. k-iP“ n T‘
poems. Mr. Hervey, when he would _
humorous, uses slang; when he would
solemn, he italicizes.” _______

FOR
LIABILITY, DURABILITY, ECONOMY
and ROUGH WEAR
On a recent trip through three States, over
trackless deserts, stock routes, through floods
' and bush tracks, in a 30-h.p. Car (weight
exceeded two tons with passengers and
luggage), Perdriau 880 x 120 Tyres carried
a party safely through this magnificent
journey of over 3200 miles, a trial that
undoubtedly proves the reliability of
PERDRIAU TYRES for extended tours.

QUEENSLAND:
Huge Resources, Plenteous Harvests,
Bracing' and Invigorating Climate,
SQUATTER’S HOMESTEAD AND GARDEN, LONG REACH DISTRICT. C.Q.
Our Greatest Need: Population.
0 the new arrival possessed of thrift, grit and perseverance,
Queensland offers opportunities to acquire wealth and
1 fame second to no other country in the world. With an
area of territory aggregating 670,500 square miles, or, in other
words, 429,120,000 acres, and a population of only 656,228, she
has room for millions of people in every walk of industrial and
commercial life, more particularly the agriculturist. The
vastness of her resources, the fertility of her
soil, the singularly varied character of
the crops raised, the regularity of
her rainfall, the genial and invig-
orating nature of her climate,
and the unparalleled pros-
perity she is at present
enjoying places her
ahead of all the other
States of the Common-
wealth of Austr a 1 i a.
Queensland holds out
a welcoming hand to
all new arrivals, and
invites them to set tl e
within her borders and
participate in the good
things which Nature has so
bountifully bestowed upon her.
To-day is the time to make a home
in this State, when conditions are so
favorable; work of all kinds is plentiful, wages
are the highest, and all sections of the com-
munity are happy and contented.
Our Most Valuable Asset: The Soil.
The conditions under which land may be taken up in
Queensland are the most liberal of any agricultural country in
the world. Despite the fertility of the scrub and river flats land,
and their close proximity to railway and shipping communication
.

in many instances, the State offers them to intending settlers at
prices ranging from £2 to per acre. At the present time
there are millions of acres open for selection under the various
modes, all of which are admirably adapted for the cultivation
of all kinds of crops and for the successful carrying on of
dairying and pastoral pursuits. Agricultural farms may
be taken up in areas aggregating 2560 acres, and the
payments therefor extend over a period of 20 years. The
purchasing price ranges from 10s. per acre
upwards; the annual rent is one-fortieth
of the purchasing price, and is
credited as part payment thereof.
Grazing selections may be
obtained in blocks up to
60,000 acres on lease for
14, 21, or 28 years, at an
average rental of l|d.
per acre. There are great
possibilities for dairy-
ing in Queensland, and
at the present time mar-
vellous expansion is taking
place.
Plans and full information
in regard to Rents, Prices, etc.,
of Crown Rands available for selec-
tion may be obtained on personal or
written application to the OFFICER-
IN-CHARGE, RAND SETTREMENT IN-
QUIRY OFFICE, George St., Brisbane.
The Fruits of tHe Soil.
The uses to which the productive lands of this State are
being put to-day include : Sheep, Cattle, Horse, Pig, Ostrich,
and Angora Goat Breeding; cultivation of Sugar, Wheat,
Maize, Barley, Cotton, Hay, and Artificial Grasses, Tobacco,
(Cigar and Pipe), Coffee, Rice, Millet, Sisal Hemp, Rubber,

Our Railway System,
Queensland can boast of having the greatest railway system,
so far as mileage of lines open for traffic is concerned, in the
Commonwealth. There are, to-day, 4604 miles of
Government Railways open for traffic, exclusive of
294 miles of line owned by public bodies and private
companies. The total railway communication is,
therefore, 4898 miles. There are 1408 miles of
railway under construction, and the' building
of a further 505 miles of line has been
approved by Parliament.
The railways under construction include
two very extensive schemes —the Great
Western railway and the North Coast
line. The former involves the building
of 1282 miles of line, and includes the
linking up of all existing Western lines.
When completed, through communication
from Brisbane to Camooweal, on the
border of the Northern Territory (a total
distance of 1335 miles) will be established.
The Great North Coast Railway will,
when the existing gaps of 454 miles are
linked up, give a continuous line from Bris-
bane to Cairns 1040 miles in length.
The total cost of the lines under con-
struction, and approved, will amount to
about 000,000.
The sum of about is also being
spent on the reorganisation of traffic and accom-
modation scheme at Roma Street and Mayne
Junction.
Beauty and Pleasure Spots.
Few countries in the world possess, such a large
number of Pleasure Resorts as exist in Queensland.
All along the coastline watering-places are to be
found with attractions peculiarly their own. Handy to
Brisbane these are : Sandgate, Humpybong, Bribie Island, Ocean

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin/* -is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

fused.

ticable, acknowledge in the “Correspondence” col-
umn all contributions submitted, whether in the form

the address is specified and stamps are enclosed. But
no MS. will be returned, or preserved, unless these
conditions are observed. When MS. is forwarded
without stamps for return it will be understood that
the copy is to be destroyed if not acceptable. Per-
sonal applications for return of MS. cannot receive

CIVILISATION STILL HOLDS OUT.
Another year lias passed, and that rather
fragile, rather cobwebby thing called Modern
Civilisation isn’t dead yet. It may, here
and there, be growing a trifle precarious on
its feet, but it looks like enduring a while
longer. Before anyone scoffs at this pro-
position re the transient nature of things,
is is well to remember that the civilisation
of nowadays is quite a different affair from
that of, say, 2500 years ago, and much more
exhausting. In old Athens and such-like
places, progress consisted mostly of paint-
ing, sculpture, architecture, poetry, phi-
losophy and other fairly-cheap circumstances.
A thin population found enough fuel for its
breakfast and dinner fire in the forests,
which, seeing that they weren’t cut down
wholesale for railway sleepers and wood
paving, or boiled down wholesale to make
paper on which to print the yellow journal,
Nature was able to keep fairly well replen-
ished. A little iron was used, and a
little gold and silver, and a few other trifles
out of the stock of goods which can’t be
replaced, but it was a leisurely world and
didn’t whoop things up on a grand scale.
It would sooner construct a statue or a
drama than build a gigantic factory chim-
ney._ Modern civilisation is quite a different
affair. It consists mostly of a furious dig-
ging up, or pumping up, or cutting down
and burning of the assets that can never be
restored. Also it consists largely of an un-
precedented multiplication of people, while
the resources on which these people depend
for a living diminish. The old civilisation
was capable of lasting practically for ever,
save for the fact that some Hun or another
was prone to come and throw bricks at it.
Its weak point was that it didn’t run to loco-
motives, cannon and ironclads. So the cul-
tured Greek, with his spear and shield,
wasn’t necessarily much better for defence
than the coarse, blood-drinking Hun was for
attack. The new civilisation is liable to die
through its habit of sitting on the end of
the branch and sawing off its own support
between itself and the trunk of the tree.
* * * *
A few cases may serve to illustrate the
point. Coal is one of the essentials of the
new civilisation, and the new civilisation
commenced in Great Britain and adjacent
countries. When the Oldest Inhabitant was
an infant—say, in 1820 —Britain mined
12,500,000 tons of coal, and all the rest of
the known coal-digging globe only mined
about 4,500.000 tons. In 1911 Britain dug
up over 271,000,000 tons, and the consump-
tion and export are still increasing. In one
year now the Bull country uses more of
Nature’s old fuel than, so far as all the
evidence goes, it did in all the millions of
years between Creation and the beginning of
the Nineteenth Century. That is a notable
proceeding and “gives furiously to think”
Nature isn’t making any more coal nowa-
days. It isn’t growing any more gigantic
forests with trees like a cathedral round the
base, and with tops that scrape the clouds,
and no longer do great convulsions swallow
up these forests and bury them 1000 ft. down
to make a new form of combustible. This
job has been given up, like many other big
institutions. If by any chance the old manu-
facture was resumed the human race must
first be wined out to make room for a new
cauldron, and there is no news of such an
event. The globe is thus living on its accu-
mulated fortune. It is exhausting its own
fat, or eating its own tail. And it is living
so fast under the present order of things
that, after one lifetime of enthusiastic coal-
burning, Britain, the place where the fever
commenced, is anxiously measuring up its
supply to ascertain how much is left.
Certainly Britain is not alone in this
business. France dug up 1,200,000 tons of
coal in 1820, and 40,000,000 tons in 1911.
In the same space of years Germany jumped
from 3,400,000 tons to 161,000,000; the
United States from 500,000 to 486,000,000;
Belgium from 1,000,000 to 23,000,000; Aus-
tria from nil to something like 200,000,000.
But Britain got to work on a large scale
earliest, and for its size it is going strongest.
Now when a bush fire starts on a calm day
and spreads in all directions, it is likeliest
to burn out first at its starting point. The
coal-fed fire of the new civilisation began
first in Britain, and there, or in the adjacent
Belgium, it is likely to burn out first. Cer-
tainly it has done an heroic amount of burn-
ing during the life-span of the Oldest In-
habitant. He practically saw the fire lit,
and his grandson may see it, if not extin-
guished, at least sinking rather low.
Coal is not the only irreplaceable element
of civilisation which has been used up at an
amazing pace since the Oldest Inhabitant
first came into the heritage of his feeding-
bottle. It is customary to regard iron as a
thing that has been in wholesale employment
ever since Tubal Cain. Yet, despite all the
quantities used to make armor, from the
days of Troy to those of Flodden and later,
and despite all the arms that were forged
from Nimrod to Waterloo, the fact remains
that iron only began to be really used when
the present respected grandsire was in his
cradle. Since 1820 Britain has increased
its digging up of pig-iron from 400,000 tons
to about 10,000,000 tons. This one little
country probably produces and uses up more
of the metal in a year nowadays than all
the world did in all the ages till the begin-
ning of the 17th century—perhaps till even
later. The world’s production and con-
sumption of iron is estimated as having been
multiplied by 150 during the period of that
surviving grandfather already hinted at in
this article. The demand for copper has
grown not quite so fast, but it has also done
a marvellous increase. There are fewer re-
liable statistics about tin, but it is recorded
that the consumption of this comparatively
little-used substance grew 13-fold in England
alone between the years 1820 and 1888. As
for mineral oil, which some sanguine people
regard as a substitute for coal, it seems to
be an article of limited supply. The first
oil-well was sunk in the United States in
1854, not long before John Stofel, of the
“Struck Oil” drama, went to the war. Con-
sumption has expanded since then from
40,000,000 to about 6,000,000,000 gallons a
year. Russia found oil in 1863, and it has
rushed up its output from 12,000,000 to
nearly 3,000,000,000 gallons per year. So
no one can say that the new civilisation
hasn’t got a hustle on itself with this com-
modity also. The oil industry practically
began in this writer’s lifetime. Whether his
son will about see it out no one can tell.
* * * #
The Oldest Inhabitant was a busy man.
When he practically discovered coal and
iron and tin and copper, and absolutely dis-
covered petroleum, he decided that an illimit-
able fortune had come his way. On this
supposition he decided that the tree- —his old
standby for fuel, ships, houses, vehicles, and
to some extent even weapons—-could almost
be dispensed with. So under his enthusiastic
guidance the tree was killed wholesale. The
primeval forest —the one which was planted
by that fine old gardener, Genesis—ex-
tended to almost within sight of New York
when AVasiiington was young. Now, if
the traveller selects his route carefully, he
can cross the United States by train, and
see hardly enough timber to feed the engine
boiler. And many other countries are in
similar plight. Statistics are rather scarce,
but it is recorded that Britain used
123,000,000 cubic feet of timber in 1820, and
(532,000,000 cubic feet in 1888, and that the
consumption per inhabitant had exactly
doubled. The British importation, during
the same 66 years multiplied by about 18,
and John Bull has now to hunt for his
plank afar off, and to seek his board at the
ends of the earth. In 1820 he grew his own
plank and board, so with nim, as with many
other folk, times have changed. But when,
the Oldest Inhabitant cut down trees he
grew people. The population of England
and Wales increased 300 per cent, between
1821 and 1911; that of the United States
1000 per cent.; that of Belgium about 200'
per cent.; Prussia, 300 per cent.; Italy, over
200 per cent.; Russia, 300 per cent.; and
so on. It was such an increase as the world
never heard or dreamed of before.

These .are a few —a very few —scattered
figures picked up at random and in haste.
The whole subject is too vast to be treated in
any detail save in a volume weighing 12ib.
It is pleasing to note that civilisation —the
coal and iron and petroleum variety—still
holds out. How long it will hold out is.
another matter. It is known, or reason-
ably suspected, not only that the forests are
diminishing fast, but that they can’t be re-
placed unless a huge proportion of the'
world’s population is killed off, or dies off,
to make room. It is known beyond all rea-
sonable suspicion, as already mentioned in
this tale, that Nature has simmered down or
cooled down, and that the great convulsive
boiling aeons in which coal and iron and
copper and tin were manufactured in the
wonderful old woman’s laboratory are with
u . s . louger. It is deduced that modern
civilisation is living on an exhaustible cap-
ital. It is visible to the naked eye that the
capital is being used up faster and faster,
not only in proportion to population, but:
beyond all proportion to population. And it;
is darkly estimated that when the exhaust-
ible capital runs low the world will either
have to find a new civilisation or do with-
out one. A side inference is that the centre
of civilisation will shift before the final
trouble arises. That is to say, that the
countries where the great, new hustle
started first and went strongest—the
thickly-peopled States where the irre-
placeable capital was dug out earliest
and dug out most energetically—will
die soonest. They will do so for the
same reason that the bush fire, already em-
ployed as an illustration in this narrative,
tends to. die first at its starting point. Then
civilisation will move outwards as the fire
does. . That is to say, that the slow races on
the circumference of things may hold the
gun, when the fast races in the middle of
thing's have used up their stock of gun-
making material.
* * * •
The finding of new continents to replace
the old ones is an exhausted industry. In-
cidentally, man has of late been further down
in the bowels of the earth than he is known
to have been before, and higher up in the
air than he is known to have been before,
and neither low down nor high up has he
found any new food, any new combustibles,
nor any new metals of importance. Further
resources may be discovered, but it isn’t:
safe to rely on that. Such things as radium
and wireless telegraphy and aeroplanes are
interesting, but as a means of keeping the
human community alive they don’t fill the
bill. It is quite reasonable to suppose that
the present civilisation of iron and coal and
petroleum and other elements will burst
somewhere. .It is really a thing of yester-
day, and seeing that it is quite temporary in
the backwards sense it may just as easily be
temporary in the forward sense. It isn’t
straining the truth much to say that the
Oldest Inhabitant and his son did it all.
It was a wonderful life-—that of the Oldest
Inhabitant.

Incidentally it is worth while to remem-
ber that Australia isn’t, for its size, a place
that is garishly overwhelmed either with
coal, iron, timber or water-power. And
when a crowd of silly, selfish speculators
clamor for a greater export of Australia’s
coal and timber —for a more furious selling
of this country’s resources so that its gun-
making material may be used up just about
the time when its Asiatic enemies are begin-
ning to dig up that material in real earnest
—then the community does well to be angry,
the same as Jonah (Chapter IV.).

A Dead Horse that Must be Carted Away
at Great Expense.
It is dawning on the citizens of Greater
Melbourne that there isn’t going to
money in the tramway system when it be-
comes their very own in 19i6. In fact, by
the present look of things, it is going to be
another of those disastrous losses which
stand as powerful lessons in regard to the
folly of handing public monopolies over to
Private Enterprise. The Tramway Co. has
observed —not being incurably astigmatic—
that the occasional, irregular motor-’buses
now running to St. Kilda, North Carlton
and East Brunswick have already made a
difference in its receipts. It has accelerated
and improved its services, but the receipts
keep on diminishing. The steps it is even
now taking are in the direction of presently,
before its lease of the trams runs out, put-
ting fast, comfortable, right up-to-date
motor-’buses on all the main avenues of
traffic between city and suburbs. The con-
sequence of this will undoubtedly be that
by July 1, 1916, nine persons out of 10
will be using ’buses, and the trams will be
almost empty. There will be then two
courses open to the municipalities. They
can either go into the ’bus business them-
selves and let the whole blessed tramway
system go to the dogs, or they can take it
over and electrify it. And that is where
they are going to strike disaster. If they
take the concern over, prior to electrifica-
tion, they must obviously take over and
pay for trams, dummies, wire ropes and
shiploads of other gear. And when they
electrify the outfit the dummies, wire ropes
(most expensive articles), engines, boilers,
etc., etc., will be just so much waste
material, which they will have to pay some-
one to cart away. That is bad enough, but
it isn’t the worst of the business. The
beautiful, wood-blocked tram track, with its
cemented, iron-bound cable tunnel, which
cost the citizens about a million and a
half, will be. instead of a revenue-producing
asset, a ruinous liability, because it will
have to be torn up and carted away and
the tunnel filled in—the present track being
replaced by a heavier, stronger and wider
one to stand the wear and tear of an elec-
trie service. While all this i. v •
at enormous expense, the present m S done >
Co. will be having a real j 0 y OUS tf*' amwa y

The Shortened Working Day.
In view of the fact that the Labor party
aas again been walking round the proposi-
tion to cut the working day down to six
hours, or the working week down to five
days-, or something of the sort, The Bulle-
tin badly desires to ask a question. It has
asked the question before, but nobody had
the civility to give an answer. This is the
problem: “Supposing a State (N-S.W- is
taken as an example) with a fairly general
eight-hour day, produces so little goods in
proportion to its demand that it has to bor-
row £8,500,000 or so in a single year to
fill its requirements, how much will it have
to borrow if it makes a big reduction in its
period of toil?” It is no use to fall b ac K
too often on the theory that with short
hours a man works better than with long
ones because his body and mind are tresiiei,
and that he actually does more. Ihe tneor
holds good only up to a certain point, tnoug
no one may be able to stick a pin 111 tbe . ®' .
lialf-minute at which production begin
fall off, and thus identify the point, ine
reduction of the working time from lb
a day to eight certainly gave the woi
opportunity to substitute an intelligent, e
cated and inventive artisan for a mere beast
of burden and carrier of loads, and t I
duction per man was increased-
doesn’t follow that a reduction no ~
hours to four, or two, or half an hour
also increase production. If such , g
did follow, then the final inference would
that the most tremendous kind of pr en _
would arise through leaving 9a
tirely. And it isn’t dead certain that, even
if the Australian worker the , of
hand-toiler—got the entire Product
his labor, his position would be
proved so much as some people imag ' , ]

The wild aboriginal gets all he produces and
often a Government blanket thrown in, yet he
is no Vanderbilt or Rockefeller. These,
however, are mostly side issues. The great
essential is to keep an eye on the magnificent
Public Debt. Last financial year the indus-
trious and intelligent N.S.W. artisan who
W as head of a family of five —himself, wife
and three children —earned a comfortable liv-
ing by working 44 hours a week, and borrow-
ing £25- That was his family’s share of the
loan money which kept the Labor Govern-
ment’s boom afloat. How he or his son will
get on when they have to live without bor-
rowing £25 per annum (for the huge loans
can’t go on for ever) is another matter. How
either of them will be when they have to
repay £25 per annum (for the loans can’t be
renewed for ever) is a second matter. Plow
everybody will be when the loans stop and
the renewals stop, and half the manhood of
the country is away opposing the invader (it
is just at such a time that the scared money-
lender refuses to take any more chances with
a country that is already pawned up to its
eyes), and huge war-taxes have to be levied,
is a third matter. All these things should be
considered along with the numerous propo-
sals for cutting down the working day or the
working week. Man is alleged to be an ani-
mal of large discourse looking before and
after. But if he doesn’t look, and only dis-
courses, he might as well be almost any kind
of an animal.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Daniel”: I am thinking of forming a Society
for the Protection of Alleged Wild Animals. The
recent mauling of a so-called “tamer” by a bothered
lion, while making film pictures, makes me feel very
sorry—for the lion. The hairy old creature is honor-
ably described in the school books as “the king of
beasts”; and most times he seems to be just as
anxious to avoid trouble and give satisfaction as the
kings of men. But he isn’t allowed to rest. When
he tries to have a sunbath, surrounded by his family,
on an African anthill, a spectacled Roosevelt steps
out of the high grass and empties some expensive and
elaborate projectile into his hindquarters. The lion
—lf he is a wise lion—thereupon rises and hurriedly
retires to obtain medical advice and see his solicitor.
The spectacled murderer wipes his goggles and makes
a few hurried notes for his heroic magazine article
(fully illustrated with photographs of dead meat).
But, if the lion has no sense, he erects his tufted tail
like a banner and charges like the Light Brigade,
only to be shot down half-way. The lion in the Zoo
has a rotten time; but he isn’t worse off than the
ruined old man who pads up and down the stairs of
a dingy boarding-house. It is the “trainer’s” lion
who has the worst time of all. When he isn’t nurs-
ing a ruined digestion in a small cage, he is being
forced to do absurd things and show a staring array
of stupid human meat how his natural instincts have
been drilled and thrashed out of him. The “trainer’s”
job, to my mind, is about as elevating as the job of
the barrel organist. A human being never makes so
poor a showing as when he gets into some enclosure.
and starts to lord it over some animal. It is a
darned poor animal that can’t look nobler than its
trainer.
“8.J.”: Julian Hose, the Rickards artist who was
amusing enough as a Hebrew impersonator until his
persistent accounts of Levinsky’s vedding started to
get on one’s nerves, had a vedding on his own
account in the United States the other day. The
bride was an Austrian lady who is not a member
of the profesh.
A Melbourne parent, charged with breach of the
Education Act in withdrawing an 11-year-old boy
from school, stated that the youngster’s heart had
been affected by picture shows. A panto., presum-
ably, would have proved fatal.
, Harry Lauder, who presently makes his appearance
m Australia with a co. at the Auditorium, Melbourne,
will be the most expensive of the Taits’ show impor-
tations te> date. According to J. N. Tait, £2OOO a
week will have to be taken before satisfactory profits
are assured.
“Stargazer”: We get some curious information at
t*y s end about Australian musicians in London.
When you hear that So-and-So, “one of Australia’s
leading singers,” is enjoying a tremendous success,
you may conclude that in all probability he has
received an encore at a suburban concert. At a time
when we were hearing quite a deal per wire about
a particular “one of Australia’s leading singers,” and
receiving an impression that the warbler was begin-
omg to find money a nuisance to him, the misfor-
tunate tenor was actually making pathetic applica-
tions to the Victorian Agent-General for a free pas-
sage to the Sunny South. John Taverner was touched
by his sad case, and eventually the celebrated tenor
received a communication from the great man. It
ran : “Report yourself to Captain , of the B ,
at Portsmouth, and you will be given a free passage
to Melbourne.” The B was going out to the
order of the Melbourne Harbor Trust—it was a
dredge! “One of Australia’s leading singers” de-
cided to stay where he was, and chance it. In his
case things improved, and now he is almost all
right.
Listen to W. F. Jury, a London kinematograph
Picture dealer: “ ‘The Last Days of Pompeii’ cost
£15,000 to produce, but ‘The Three Musketeers’ will
cost fully £lB,OOO. I reached Paris at 615 one
evening, and at 9.15 I had bought the English and
Australian rights for £lO,OOO. .. .Some of the lead-
io? provincial theatres showing pictures are now
talcing more in a day than they used to take in a
month. There is a certain hippodrome which cost
£40,000 to build. After going through various
troubles for two years it was sold for £lO,OOO to

that manager is now making out of his pictures
£3OO a week....ln Paris I saw an invention by
means of which a continuous performance of ani-
m*Hed _ pictures could be given without the use of
celluloid films. Instead of such films there were
glass discs, working automatically, the machine
generating its own light at the same time. This
Process can be used for lectures, for hospital scien-
tific demonstrations, and so on. Note that you can

more of it which can be commended to the notice

“Bloore”: The Children’s Court in Syd-
ney is a well-meaning institution. It can
speak very nicely in private to the lad
charged with stealing stickjaw, and send him
back to his parents with a caution. It can
also place the more hardened criminal under
State control for five years, and quite a lot
of parents accept the situation as being the
best possible for their uncontrollable off-
spring. Indeed, many of them realise that
the Mittagong Farm Home is a good place
for a boy, and immeasurably superior to the
cld Sobraon, where Mason had the job of
training a lad to reef and splice, and then
had the mortification of seeing him placed
in the Cow country. However, though
Galbraith, P.M., has the power to send a
lad to a Government institution for five
years, other authorities have the power to
transfer the lad from the institution to an
employer as an apprentice without any re-
ference to either the Court or the juvenile’s
parents ; and the wail of the parent when he
finds that his lad is up on the Clarence, feed-
ing pigs, would lift the roof of the Supreme
Court. The lad may remain in the institu-
tion (where he is at least under the super-
vision of a staff of officers) for six months,
and then he may be “transferred” to the
North Cowst or any other old place, where
supervision happens along once every six
months or so. And the Cow people are very
fond of this kind of cheap labor. I know
of one man who, with eight sons, can’t make
things “gee” at all, and wants a Children’s
Court boy to lend a hand with his Here-
fords. I suggested, instead, an immigrant
at 10s. a week, but he reckoned it would be
“a bit of a strain.” If ever I meet him at
the Show I shall certainly try to sell him a
milking machine. Harking back to the
juvenile delinquent, the rule appears to be
that, so long as the sleeping accommodation
is of certain measurements and the guard-
ian’s home not too far away from a church
and Sunday-school (most important, this),
the parent may whistle for his offspring
until the period for which his child, ordered
to an “institution,” may expire.

“Vagabond,” from Paris :
This city is now inhabited almost entirely by Eng-
lish, Americans and Australians. There are compara-
tively few of the French and other foreigners that
one would expect to find. In the Moulin Rouge, the
Rat Mort, and the cafes and restaurants, in Mont-
martre you hear little else but English spoken. The
boots and the waiter in my hotel speak English, and
the maid speaks English with her tongue and French
with her eyes. Even the ’bus conductor is liable,
when you ask him in pure French “How much?” to
answer “00-won pen-ee.” About the only people
I’ve discovered without a working knowledge of good
Australian are the cafe waiters. They understand
your order all right, but it is impossible to make
them understand that you want your change. That
is, if you can catch the waiter again after he has
taken your money. Usually he keeps hovering in the
very far offing, and never allows his eye to meet
yours. Loads of Britishers are constantly driving
round the streets in huge char-a-bancs, and from the
tomb of Napoleon to the marble-topped tables of the
Caf6 Anglais British speech and sovereigns ring tri-
umphant. Talk about Invasion! But it puzzles me
where the French have fled to.

The Australian or the Maorilander may
be a better bushman than he is a sailor, but
he can manage to rake a pot of money off
the sea for all that. Forty years ago James
Mills and two or three other Dunedin
(M.L.) men owned three cockleshells that
crawled along the coast from their home-
port to Onehunga. One of them was the
Maori, a mammoth of 174 tons, and the
Beautiful Star beat its rival by 40 cwt.
James Mills was the managing owner for
the firm which called itself the Harbor
Steam Co. Of course James Mills didn’t
stand still. When he had got more work
than the Maori and the Beautiful Star could
stagger under, he sent off for a couple of
bigger ships, and formed the Union Steam-
ship Co. to pay for them. That was 38
years ago. In 12 months the co. had a
capital of £lOO,OOO. Within four years the
red funnels had so much work to do that
the co. got more capital; and after that it
mostly made its own capital. Now and
again Mills dived into the shareholders’
pockets for a trifle, but that was only when
the business rushed ahead faster than the
profits he could hang on to after giving the
shareholders their bite. As a rule, they
didn’t know how much he teas hanging on
to. Six or seven years ago. when the capital
had been pushed up to £BOO.OOO, the manag-
ing director said he had £200.000 that the
shareholders might have if they weren’t too
busy to lift it, and they could take it in
shares if they liked. Of course they liked.
Now there’s a whole million that has been
dealt with in the same way, so the Red
Funnel capital for a time will be £2,000,000,
of which probably about one-fourth came out
of the shareholders’ pockets—the other
three-fourths Mills has saved up for them.
The Maori and the Beautiful Star are
things of no consequence now. There are
75 ships in the Red Funnel fleet in these
days—7s ships, running up to the Niagara,
of 13,500 tons, carrying close on 3,000,000
tons of freight a year, eating up an annual
600,000 tons of coal, and poking their noses
into Vancouver, Calcutta, Great Britain
and most other places where there’s pas-
senger-money to be picked up or freight to
be handled.

“Ex-Bombardier”: It was in the ’9o’s,
when things looked very sultry between
Britain and Germany, that the officer in
charge of Largs fort, near Port Adelaide,
had the distinction of receiving the sur-
render of a German merchantman. We
were engaged in gunnery exercises, including
the handling of live shells, when, through
mishap, one of the guns was fired. The shell
went screaming out over the Gulf and passed
unpleasantly close to the bows of a tramp
steamer going into port. The captain lost
no time in heaving-to, and having lowered a
boat was soon rowing vigorously towards
the fort. As soon as he scrambled ashore
he was met on the beach by a couple of
officers who had gone down to meet him
with profuse apologies. But the German
got in first. Waving his hands like sema-
phores to show his defencelessness, he ran
forward, shouting, “I surrenter! I sur-
renter!” It was before the days of wireless t
telegraphy, and the terrified merchant-
skipper, who for months had had no com-
munication with the shore, believed that the
ugly feeling which was abroad when he left
had culminated in war.

“Furious Victim”: Social etiquette is
mostly a lumbersome sort of animal; but I
£uess there is a good idea at the back of it —
i.e., to make smooth the social way of human
beings and hasten the last burying of the
hatchet and stone axe. Years ago, when I
took a deep interest in such questions as
whether it was correct to wear a green or
red tie with evening dress to a wake, there
used to be a wise rule forbidding any in-
vited guest to foist on an unwarned host or
hostess any personal friend the guest might
happen to have about him when the invita-
tion fell due. Nobody seems to worry about
that rule now; and the consequence is that
the most carefully planned party, gathering,
or boil-over is liable to be broken up or dis-
organised by the intrusion of one of those
deadening and time-murdering bores who are
for ever drifting about at a loose end. ready
to attach themselves to any good-natured
soul who will let them linger on like an epi-
demic. The man who likes to be kind to
dull animals will whip up a cowardly pre-
tence of joy when the Blobbses clearly
indicate that it is their fiendish purpose,
unless absolutely insulted, to stay to the
next meal, and cart their lost souls to any
dashed place or destination he (their host)
has in view. Late one dark, windy night, I
tried to rescue an old friend from a bore who
had sunk his mental fangs into him and was
slowly numbing him into a stupor, by sug-
gesting that we should walk five miles to the
cemetery and do up his grandfather’s grave.
But the bore promptly interjected that he
would love a good walk, and was passionately
addicted to gardening. So I changed the
subject, and we all blithered on together for
another three hours. Good-natured people
—-or, maybe, it is really weak-minded people
—who. in the good old phrase, “keep open
house,” are dangerous guests ; for the simple
reason that they are always followed by
someone you don’t know, or half-know, or
don’t want to know. Usually it is someone
you don’t want to know. In any case, it is
always someone you hadn’t looked to see, and
have not provided for. Sometimes there are
enough refreshments to go round; but there
is never sufficient charity or interest. The
victimised host or hostess need never hope
to get any change out of the intruder who
comes apologetically at a guest’s heels. The
interesting man or woman leads a fairly full
and well-planned life, and is, therefore,
hardly ever found lingering round a friend’s
house when that friend has an engagement.
It is only your derelict bore who lurks
pathetically like a famished hound when
there is entertainment in the air. I write
this in anger, having just had an evening
reunion devastated by an uproarious and
mentally untidy dreamer who obtained ad-
mittance simply by being attached, in the
lost-dog sense, to a neighbor who “keeps open
house” —that is to say, a house where study
is impossible, and privacy is not, and half
the family is always outside or gone visiting
so that it may not be afflicted with the other
half’s social hangers-on.
“Flinderino”: Quite a number of Aus-
tralians get some of their wearing apparel
built to order in Hongkong and other
Chinese towns. I first became aware of
this when one day I was assisting to search
for opium and other contraband amongst
the “luggage” of some returned Celestials
on the wharf at Cairns (Q.). In a cam-
phor-wood box, amongst parcels of
smelling herbs and other mysteries, was a
bundle of white drill. On untying the rope
various suits of clothes were found, each
with a tag bearing the name of the person
it was made for; and I cursed as I read
the names of some people whom I had looked
upon as good Australians. The Chinese
storekeepers of the North act as agents for
their tailor cousins in the land of bad
smells. The orders and measurements are
sent by post to Hongkong, and the finished
article is usually brought over amongst the
“luggage” of Jimmie Ah Wan, who is re-
turning to his banana patch to patiently
accumulate another sock of sovereigns.
A B. LLADE OF BLESSINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Life’s gifts may be both rich and rare;
Life’s table hold a well-filled plate;
Smooth fortune, fame, firm friends, good fare
Congenial tasks, a love-course straight—
All these, perchance, a happy fate
May grant ere Death the slate shall wipe;
But, more than all, three things I rate:
My books, my fireside and my pipe.
The crested breakers kill all care;
The dance can dear delights create;
Heard in the dusk, a well-loved air,
Played softly, can grey grief abate.
These all I hold in high estate;
But give to me, as charm’s chief type,
On which all others must await,
My books, my fireside and my pipe!
ENVOI.
Thrice-trusty three! With joy innate
And homely happinesses ripe;
With you I fear nor harm nor hate:
My books, my fireside and my pipe!

When first we met a raincoat hid
You, dear, from chin to feet;
Your merits though were plain to me,
Your mouth was nice, as I could see,
Your figure more than neat.
At our next meeting you were in
(Or out of) evening dress;
I could in detail then survey
Your charms, and I need hardly say,
I loved you none the less!
I care not though your skirt be slashed
And well-filled hose peep through.
Such garb won’t cause me to adore
You less; in fact, I love you more,
The more I see of you!

POLITI CAL
POINTS
“Henry Horsecollar” writes :
It is a poor tart that never rejoices, and he who
doesn’t receive a Christmas present is liable to cold
feet. N.S.W. has received one. Last June it was
informed that its wonderful Holman-McGowen Min-
istry had overrun the policeman to the extent of
£2,156,724 on revenue account, that being its
shortage for three years, and that its accounts in
general—Revenue, Loan, Works and Settlement —
were overdrawn to the extent of £ 6,000,000. Now
the State learns that things have become a heap
worse, so it can eat its Christmas turkey in peace.
No one can be much poorer than broke, or much
deader than dead, or much older than Eternity, and
what’s the use of worrying?
Railway accounts are belated things at
times, but when they turn up they are always
interesting. During the last financial year
—to June 30, 1913 —there were opened in the
Commonwealth 885 miles of new line, and
of these 98i miles, or about one-ninth, were
in N.S.W. The earnings—that is to say, the
amount which remained after paying working
expenses—dropped by £273,361, and £217,778
of that drop, or about three-fourths of the
whole lot, was in N.S.W. The net earnings
—what remained after paying interest and
expenses—slumped by £571,528, and of that
downfall £228,609, or something between one-
third and one-half, was in N.S.W. Yet
N.S.W. borrowed about as much money to
be “blewed” on the old “permanent and re-
productive” fake as all the other States put
together. It seems a disappointing result.
Poor old Ma got far more than her share of
the liabilities and the slump, but her share
of the new lines is almost imperceptible.
The proposal to create an up-to-date harbor
at Blackscd Bay, in the wildernesses of Con-
naught (Ireland), and start a city there, and
try thus to cut a scrap off the time from the
British Tsles to New York, is a reminder that
Bull and Alexander and Patrick have no use
for Australia’s policy of One State One
Bloated Port. When the great attempt was
made in the muddled old ages to wipe out
the Irish nation, the alternative offered was
removal to “Hell or Connaught,” and that
province of bogs and rocks isn’t much of a
place to remove to. But it has some splend’d
harbors, and in the present rush of commerce
Patrick Mcßull doesn’t care whether he
trades from Connaught or London. And
London doesn’t care. ~ It has lately acquired
sense enough to know that it can make
money even out of Connaught.
Amid the recent industrial upheavals in
Dublin (Ireland) it was mentioned, in a
heated sort of way, that in that city there
were 21,000 families living in one-roomed
residences. It may be an exaggeration, but
even if it isn’t, what of it? A Freetrade
country has to compete on level terms with
all the one-roomers upon earth, and, when
necessary, it fights them on one-roomed
principles. In some big Indian cities like
Delhi various families often occupy one
room, and the really cheap families pitch
their tents on the flat roof. These people
take a lot of competing with.
Advices from India say that the Christian
religion is now spreading apace—among
the outcasts and those whose caste is so
humble that they might almost as well be
without any. That, when you come to
think of it, was how it started many cen-
turies ago. It appealed first to the slave,
as the only creed which promised, in another
world, to make him greater than Csesar,
and where the bulk of the population were
slaves it could hardly do otherwise than
prosper. It was the highest bidder for
popular spiritual support—in fact, it was
the only bidder. Now in India it offers
the humblest brown specimen equality with
the inflated and chest-protruding Brahmin,
and the Brahmin has stuck out his chest so
far and so long that the offer cannot be
otherwise than tempting.
“Y.’s” footnote to a page of N.S.W. his-
tory :
In one particular a wrong is done to Henry
Parkes; and the wrong seems to be growing greater
instead of less. Always nowadays the old man is
represented as the sole instrument that produced the
outbreak of anti-Irishism during the visit of the
royal Edinburgh to N. S. Wales. As a matter of
fact, James Martin, himself a born Irishman, was
up to his eyebrows in the political plot. He was
Parkes’s Attorney-General at the time, and his was
the hand that drafted the Bill of insults to Irish
residents. Since Phillip’s day no such measure
grovelling to Royalty on one side and pandering to
anti-Irishism on the other, had been offered to an
Australian Parliament. Parkes was constitutionally
antagonistic to a good deal of what goes as Irish,
sentiment, and to that sentiment, when translated
into politics, he was at that date instinctively op-
posed. He was consequently estranged from most
local Irishmen. His fall into partisan truculence
was, therefore, in a sense, natural. But Martin had
had the local Irish at his back, had gained much by
their influence, and could have blocked Parkes's
truculence had he filed. Instead, he enthusiastically
collaborated with his chief, and it was for his share
in the business that he received his K.C.M.G -ship.
There was one British Government which
had really big ideas of settling the Irish
question ; and it invited the Dutch nation,
which was hard pressed at the time, to come
over bodily and settle in Ireland. It was a
huge idea, but, fortunately for the British
Government, the Hollanders shied off the
proposal. The handful of Dutchmen, with
a streak of French, that settled South Africa
has given the British Government much
trouble as it is, but what sort of a time
would Britain ha\ e had with the whole
Dutch nation, the whole Irish nation, and
the whole Dutch-Irish nation combined?

wrecked sailors, afraid that the vampire
currents would suck them back from the
reach of land, deserted their raft and swam
bore to where a white-painted flagstaff
pointed out civilisation in the shape of the
little "port” of Peepingee.
It fell to the fortune of the Reverend
jlcUladdery to receive them. He was perched
uii a rock some little distance in the water,
mid was taken so unawares that the shock
nearly lost him his balance. He had
donned old clothes and swam out to the
rock, partly to catch oysters, and partly to
meditate how, without raising Constable
iienard’s suspicions, he could make refer-
ence in his Sunday sermon to Billy Mor-
row’s habit of sly-grog selling. A convic-
tion would play into the hands of publican
Lanfred, and he had just decided to say
nothing, when a hoarse cry, coming as it
were from the very depths of the sea, broke
into his thoughts.
The parson clambered to his feet, and
shading his eyes from the dazz.ling glare of
the water, he made out the heads of three
swimmers, not many yards away. Then-
struggles for the shore were very feeble, and
without a moment’s hesitation McGladdery
plunged into the water. He was a strong
swimmer, and his powerful strokes soon
brought him into their midst. He reached
for the nearest, who, however, avoided him.
“Save Dutchy,” panted the man, “back a
bit.”
“Which one?” shouted McGladdery.
“Coming—farther back —a bit.”
McGladdery could see no other, but he
went on in the hope of picking up a fourth
man. Five minutes’ effort rewarded him
with the sight of Dutchy, exhausted, breath-
less and desperately dog-paddling. The par-
son ordered him to cease his efforts, and
turn on his back. The man, recognising re-
lief at hand, did as he was bid. McGladdery
took a firm hold and finally managed to land
the wearied Dutchy among his companions
on the beach.
The strange quartette, stretched log-like,
presented a tragic appearance. One was
already asleep, his mouth wide open. Deep
languor was upon them all, and they breathed
hard and huskily. It was some time before
the parson could make up his mind what
course to pursue. At length the torn and
tattered clothes of the man who had first
refused his help made him remember his
own good suit lying up on the sand-bank. He
proceeded to vigorously shake the four whom
the sea had given over to his keeping, until
they were all staring at him in half-awakened
wonder.
McGladdery brought his clerical suit and
offered it to the man who was almost nude.
That person leaned his weight on his bene-
factor’s shoulder, and silently and gratefully
dragged off his wet rags, substituting the
black garments in their stead. Then he
stood erect, and looked into McGladdery’s
face.
“I reckon we must have struck Aus-
tralia?” he said.
The parson beamed and nodded.
“That’s good news, then,” said the visitor.
“We are from the ship Arabian, wrecked 16
days ago. My name’s Hagly : this is Dutchy
and Pellew —and Gibbons.”
The parson solemnly shook hands with

"'ere too weak to walk, he would hurry off
ar *d bring the mail-driver’s spare waggon-
ette. Rut the shipwrecked sailors signified
their willingness to accompany him any-
where.
.Just at this stage, however, the religious
side of McGladdery turned uppermost.
Men.” he said emotionally, “Providence has
guided you to the exact point where Provi-
dence sent me to meet you. It is a miracle.
Help and succor are at hand. It is enough.
Let us pray.”
He closed his eyes as was his custom, and
offered up a small, earnest prayer of thanks-
giving, but when he opened his eyes again
he was mortified and considerably upset at
the attitude of the four sailors. They had
fallen back a few paces, and were huddled
together like animals stricken with sudden
fear, staring at him as if he were some
strange apparition.
“Men,” cried the parson in grieved tones,
“what is the matter? Why are you so con-
cerned? Does a mere prayer frighten you?
Are you not prepared to join me in offering
up thanks for your deliverance?”
Hagly, whose head towered above the
others, spoke. “Are you,” he asked hoarsely,
“a preacher?”
“I am,” admitted the parson. “Is there
anything unnatural or alarming about that?

“No —-no,” was the hasty response, but

for words to explain. Then he began fidget-

those other things,” he went on, apprehen-
sively. “I —I feel uncomfortable in these.
And he would have thrown off the black
suit again only that Pellew interposed.
“Don’t be a fool. Dick,” said he. He
didn’t have anything to do with Sam.

saw light, “do not connect me with some

It was alive to its obligations, and received
its forced guests with open arms. The little
township’s heart ceased to beat—pro fem.—
in publican Lanfred’s Evening Star Hotel.
Food and clothing were supplied in abun-
dance, and some money was subscribed. And
that evening there was a gathering at the
dilapidated little church—the biggest gather-
in'* it had ever contained. The proceedings
were intended as a sort of informal thanks-
giving service. The four rescued sailors
were there refreshed by sleep. Ihey came
with reluctance, but they had no tangible
excuse for staying away. The Kev. McGlad-
dery ascended the pulpit and addressed the
assemblage with fervid eloquence. But
McGladdery’s sea experiences were limited
to one journey across the Great Australian
BDht, and he had to draw upon his imagi-
nation to conjure up the perils of the deep.
He had never been lost; had never been
without food for more than 24 hours; and
presently, his flow of language failing some-
what, he turned to Hagly.
“Hagly.” he asked, “could you come up
with me here in the pulpit, and paint us a
little picture in words of your hardships and
trials V We shore-people, except for a
willie-willie or two, know nothing of the
dangers of the deep beyond Coral Island.”
Hagly shook his head in sudden confusion.
Then McGladdery remembered something.
“You have a diary—let me read a little of
that.”
“It’s all smudged,” muttered Hagly, cast-
ing a furtive look around.
‘‘Never mind—we will read where it is
plain. I’m sure the congrega—er —com-
pany is burning to hear something of the
terrors of those 16 days.”
Every eye was upon the embarrassed
sailor, and his sun-tanned skin darkened
considerably under the scrutiny. Reluct-
antly he produced the diary and handed it
up to the parson, who eagerly opened it.
“It’s in excellent condition,” he exclaimed,
“and it’s not very long either —why it starts
with the sth of this month.”
“The day after we left the Arabian,” mut-
tered Hagly.
The Rev. McGladdery cleared his throat
and began : A , .
“sth Aug. —l’m not sure about the date,
but if I ever make land again, I’ll back-
paddle on the calendar and make it plumb
correct. This is the first day I have written
in this diary, although I have carried it for
years. But that is because there are no
sails to clew, and no rust to chip. There
are five of us drifting about on one of the
Arabian’s rafts, and the only things to
worry about are^ —what’s going to happen
to us; what am I going to write, and what s
wrong with Sam Bird? Yesterday we had
a hell —er, horrible, I presume you meant,
Hagly—of. a time. There was enough wind
to blow a man’s brains out, and the seas
rose up white on top, and the white was like
teeth that snapped at the riggings and bit
down our masts. We would have weathered
through all right, only she sprung a leak
somewhere in the for’ard hold, and the

pumps were about as good as trying to sop
it up with a rag. So we lowered the only
two boats that were free of wreckage, and
dropped provisions and a barrel of water in
each. But the old man and second mate
were skunks —they jumped in one boat and
got clear, leaving the other to carry 12 men.
I rushed down ip the fo’c’s’le to get a coat,
and who should be there but Sam Bird,
down on his knees —praying. ‘You blast’ —
urn Hagly—‘You blasted fool,’ I yelled.
‘Come on.’ The idiot wouldn’t, but by the
Lord Harry, I wasn’t going to leave him.
I lugged him to his feet, and drove an old
sail-needle in him until he did move. And
when we were all ready to cut the painter
we waited for a favorable lurch to fling us
clear of the davits. Sam was nearest the
stern rope, and Gibbons passed him a knife
to cut clear. ‘Now,’ yelled the bo’sun, and
he cut the for’ard tackle. Instead of slash-
ing, the blamed fool Bird began to pray. We
swung off on a single rope, then rushed back
as the Arabian heeled. Bash ! We hit into
her sides and flew to splinters. The next
thing I remember was being hauled on to
this raft by Pellew, and I was too battered
to care who else was on. To-day I woke
up to find five of us —Pellew, Gibbons,
Dutchy, Bird and myself. The raft-barrel
contains only a gallon or so of brackish
water, and the biscuits in the tin that was
lashed here a year ago, are wet and mouldy.
The sea is as level and still as a sheet of
glass. Sam Bird has been muttering
prayers all day.
“6th Aug. —Calm as yesterday. I have
been elected captain, because this diary is
looked upon as the log-book. I have taken
possession of the biscuits. There are 250
in the tin. I have allotted four to each
man, and five mouthfuls of water. Sam

was trying to pray at the same time.

were slowly rowing. I cautioned my men
to lie still and close together. It was get-

near enough we were to board him. If
there was any trouble we intended to place
them on the raft, and let them go to the

came, and everything was going beautiful,

buck against religion. We cautioned Bird
not to be so fervent.”
McGladdery stopped the narrative to com
pliment Hagly on the excellence of his judg-
ment. Then he resumed his reading.
“,Bth Aug. —l was forced to dole out one
extra biscuit per man. Bird praying.
“ 9th Aug. —Water in barrel sinking—or
evaporating—rapidly. Biscuits going. Bird
praying.
“ 10th Aug. —Bird praying.
“lltli Aug. —Spots appeared on Dutchy s
face. Gibbons saw them first. He drew me
to a corner and whispered for me to look.
‘Small-pox,’ he whispered. ‘We’d better
throw him over.’ I looked into Gibbons’s
face to see if he was joking. As I looked I
saw red marks on his neck. I turned to
Dutchy and Bird. There were the same
blotches on their faces. We acquainted
each other of the damning fact. Bird
prayed for light on the subject.
“12th Aug. —The blotches broke into
sores. We put it down as scurvy. It has
taken hold of me, too.
“13th, llfth, 15th Aug. —Calms hanging
on like death. Only 20 biscuits left.
Hardly any water left in barrel. Hopeless
outlook. Bird continually praying. We
are quite used to it now.
“ 16th Aug. —Wind sprang up from south,
veered around, and drove eastward. We went
pretty near mad with joy, and Bird sang a
hymn. Rain came with the wind, and each
took off his clothes in turn to wring them
out on the top of the upturned barrel.. We
were that delirious, we ate the remainder
of the biscuits.
“17th Aug.— Oh, if we had only kept a
biscuit for to-day. I think we are all be-
ginning to hate each other. Nobody has
spoken for hours except Bird, and it was
not to us he spoke. I’m frightfully hungry.
“18th Aug. —Hours I have spent trying
to define hunger, and I have at last given it
up. There is a sensation of rats gnawing
at my stomach. I am certain now we do
hate the sight of each other. I keep to one
corner; Pellew. Gibbons and Dutchy have
annexed the other three. Bird prays in
the centre. Once I caught Pellew and Gib-
bons exchange a glance, and then look at
me devilishly queer. I affected not to have
noticed.
“19th Aug. —Last night a steamer passed
close to us. We all stood up and yelled—
except Bird. He thought prayer would
help more. I tore off a splinter from the
raft, and drove it into his back. The scream
he loosed put our combined efforts in the
shade. But it was too late, the steamer had
passed beyond reach. This morning we
resumed our positions on the raft, and con-
tinued to be driven eastward. I feel that
empty and miserable, that I. haven’t got the
heart to write more. What is the good?. .. .
I stopped for a little while, feeling somehow
that Pellew was watching me. He and
Gibbons were both trying silently to attract
my attention Bird is praying 1 won-
der why they look at me so strangely ?”
“That is all,” said McGladdery, laying
down the diary with a sigh. “You wrote
no more, but what agony you must have
experienced during the three remaining days.
Indeed, I marvel you all did not succumb.
However did you manage to sustain life?
And you stopped just when we were breath-
less to know what your shipmate wished to
say.”
“Well, you see,” said Hagly in the tones
of a man driven to bay, “Pellew was hungry
—we were all hungry. We may have been
mad, but we put our trouble on to Bird’s
praying. He was down on his knees at the
time —and —and his eyes were shut. We
couldn’t throw him overboard —you see we
were hungry”
The Rev. McGladdery suddenly held up
his hand, and his voice shook as he inter-
cepted Haglv’s faltering words.
“Samuel Bird,” he said with deep rever-
ence, “was a martyr.”

death from a direct and uncomplicated wound will
soon be all but impossible.— Daily paper.
T ll HE day he split my skull in two,
I Our strife had raged since half-past
nine ;
Her hair was gold, her eyes were blue.
And she had previously been mine ;
He smote with vengeance and with might,
I felt my blood run down my beard,
And all the people with delight
Stood in their balconies and cheered.
My left eye was the last to close,
1 1 watched her with it to the end;
The soft white linen at her nose
Was wet with sorrow for a friend,...
A friend—no more! And so I died,
My cold lips trembling, with her name,
And then they took my corpse inside
And Jones, the undertaker, came.
A spirit person took my soul,
And led it from the empty clay
lhrough something like a large black hole
lhat opened in the shining way;
We fell like stones dropped in the void
Clean through the curving roof of Hell
And ten kind devils were employed,
With nets, to catch us as we fell.
M e landed safe in meadows green,
Soft meadows bright with bud and leaf,
•Nor hint of any fire was seen,
Nor heard I wail of woe or grief •
But men went softly to and fro,
And women tripped on dainty feet,
W here fallen spirits, sat a-row
With cool, iced drinks and things to eat.
The roof above was faintly blue,
The air was sweet, the breezes kind.
No one had anything to do,
And no one greatly seemed to mind.
1 could not understand at all
How Hell had earned its ill repute.
1 thanked old Adam for his fall,
And Eve for the forbidden fruit.
For both were there, with Tom and Kate,
And other folk unknown to fame;
I guessed old Nero by his gait,
And spotted Byron walking lame;
And Jezebel and Good Queen Bess
Were there in all their queenly charm,
And, in Elizabethan dress,
Shakspeare and Bacon arm in arm.
Oh glad was I my head was split,
tor such a company was good,
lhe place was full of love and wit
And everything to match my mood.
A dimpled maiden, with a smile,
Drew near and placed her hand in mine,
And five blue fiends in single file
Bore choice of good cigars and wine.
Four days amid the cheerful dead
I feasted royally and well,
(Because my sins were somewhat red)
An honored guest in Central Hell;
But when the fifth clear morn had come
The air grew full of heat and noise,
And something beating like a drum
Shot thrills of pain through all my joys.
A horrent darkness wrapped me round,
jelled with red streaks of leaping fire,
i felt that I was gagged and bound
W ltn lines of live electric wirq.
The girl who wore the dimpled smile
Had vanished like a song unsung,
And no one thought it worth his while
lo place some ice upon my tongue.
Then everything went black and dead,
And when to sense of pain I woke,
Large strips of bandage swathed my head
And near me was a doctor bloke.

She was a female garbed in blue,

With decent luck we’ll pull him through.”

But facts were plain enough to see,

Had patched me up and mended me.
And so for bitter weeks, I lay
And, as they said, got right and well,
Dragged back again to face the dav.
And miss the pleasant oaths of Ilell.
And by-and-bye they let her in,

Whose hair like sunlight on the dew ;
And she was glad, and wept and said,
Ah, now I love you as my own,
If William had not split your head,
I never, never might have known.”
But I was thinking of a smile
And dimples on a pretty chin,
And happy fiends in single file
Who bore the pleasant liquids in,
And of long days serene and blue.
In meadows where the airs were kind,
And no one had a thing to do,
And no one greatly seemed to mind.
N.S.W.
CURSE O’ MOSEs.
Bolger’s Bargain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CONYERS had been away three years.
He thought of it with something like
a pang as he pulled up near the little
bush school at the Cross Roads. In the in-
terval his old fancy, Pauline Cowdery
whom he had left with her mother in Gun-
nedah, had taken charge of the academy,
which was a small weatherboard building
fronting a thick scrub. Mrs. Cowdery’s
home was a mile further down the main
road. The other road ran through the
scrub, and was principally used by Rusmus
Bolger, a bachelor farmer. Conyers in-
tended to look that person up about bed-
time as he was an old acquaintance, and
the farm was the only place thereabouts
to stay at.
For the present he hid his horse and
posted himself among the bushes. He
judged by the sun that school would soon
be out, and Pauline would be walking
lome. A man could say a lot in the course
of a mile walk on a lonely road, and Mrs.
Cowdery would be glad to see him, and
would ask him to tea. Then Pauline would
play the piano, and he would sing that song
he sang to her last in Gunnedah. He reck-
oned it would make a stir among the old
CARD-TIME IN COWLAND.
BILL DURHAM: “Say, blokes, it's near two o’clock in the mor nin. S’pose we Nay this
’and out and knock off? ”
JACK JERSEY: “Oo, might’s well play on till it’s time ter bring in the cows.”
memories. They had been as good as
sweethearts.
His thoughts were suddenly interrupted
by the appearance of Rusmus Bolger. The
big farmer halted at the end of the scrub
track, holding a cabbage under one arm and
a turkey under the other, and looked towards
the school.
“Not out yet,” he remarked. Then he de-
posited his poultry and his vegetable on the
ground, consulted his watch, which he car-
ried in a leather pouch on his belt, and
finally seated himself on the end of a log.
“Make they a good Sunday dinner,” he
said, addressing the cabbage and the gob-
bler. “Ought to ask I un arter this.”
School came out, and the yelling juveniles
rapidly dispersed in various directions. Bol-
gei peered through the bushes, nervous and
excited, and as Miss Cowdery stepped out
he made a clumsy effort at throwing a kiss
which she couldn’t see. Conyers stared—-
and frowned. He itched to kick the fellow,
but Bolger was too big, and a scene just then
would not improve matters. Apart from
his size and his finances, there was nothing
about the simple agriculturist to attract
a smart young woman like Miss Cowdery.
He was as dull as ditch-water, and his face
was like tanned liogskin, set in a frame of
tawny bristles that swept down under his
throat from both ears. His chin and upper
lip were shaven. He was well over 40, and
half that time, to Conyer’s knowledge, he
had been in pursuit of a wife. The most
neglected women laughed at him and called
lmn “a booby.” Yet Conyers was jealous.
The booby had money, and matrimony is
very often a matter of money.
Miss Cowdery came on to the road, car-
rying a pink parasol. Rusmus stepped out
to meet her. So did Conyers, to the other’s
discomfiture. The smile evaporated from
Ins broad face, and a look of defeat and re-
sentment came into liis eyes.
Hay, Rusmus,” .said Conyers. “Goimr
to market?”
Rusmus scowled. “Did ye want to see
1 i —suspiciously.
Not just now. I’ll be down to-night'”
Conyers informed him. “How d’ve dn
’Miss Cowdery?”
“Why, Mr. Conyers, you’re quite a stran-
ger!’ said that young lady, shaking hands
delightedly. Rusmus couldn’t shake hands;-
he was handicapped with too much farm
asked CC ’ When dld you get ba ck?” she
“Just arrived,” he answered.
Looking for a job, baint ye?” Bolger 'n-
terposed viciously. h
Conyers didn’t notice him.
“How’s your mother?” lie' asked.

fiercely on the presumptuous Conyers.

sjud Bolger. “He be goin’ to th’ faarm.”
Hon t put yourself out on my account,
Rusmus,” said Conyers. “I’m used to bein’
alone, an’ I know the way to the farm.”
“There be a pair on us, then,” Rusmus
returned with a vibrating laugh. “Come
along. Miss Cowd’rv.”
Conyers took the cabbage and walked on
one side of the little school-teacher, and Bol-
ger walked on the other with the turkey.
Conversation was strained and awkward
Mr. Bolger was the most embarrassed of
the three, and he soon began to loathe tur-
keys. The presence of the intermeddling
Conyers had turned his good intentions into
a farce.
‘‘Lovely weather we’re having, aren’t
we? Miss Cowdery remarked when they
had studied the landscape for some time.
Splendid weather,” Conyers assented.
Grand weather,” Bolger corroborated.
She scanned the firmament during the
next few yards. ‘‘l think we’ll soon have
rain, she said then.
“I think so,” Conyers agreed.
. * we will,” Bolger iterated, look-
ing aloft. . His foot hooked a protruding
root, and m the effort to recover himself he
dropped the turkey. The bird, with a couple
of kicks, freed its legs and cut into the
scrub, Bolger plunging after it with his hat
in his hand, and distress signals streaming
behind. Miss Cowdery laughed, and went
on.
‘‘Mother will be disappointed,” she said.
‘Was she expectin’ the turkey?” asked
Conyers.
“She was expecting Mr. Bolger,” Miss
Cowdery answered. “I wanted to get rid
of him, though, as you were coming up.”
Conyers felt highly flattered, and for a
while his feet seemed to tread on air.
“Seems to have quite an attachment for
your family,” he said generously.
“Yes,”. Miss Cowdery admitted. “Don’t
be surprised to hear of a wedding in our
neighborhood in the near future.”
THE SCIENCE OE CURING THINGS.
The bee-sting cure for rheumatism.
Conyers was suddenly chilled.
, “Young men must be pretty scarce round
ere.” he remarked sarcastically.
“Why so?”
“Rusmus Bolger’s old enough to be your
father,”
“Well, he’ll be a father, or, more correctly,
a stepfather.”
“Oh,” said Conyers, his spirits on the ur>-
gra/Je again. “It’s your mother he’s after?”
Of course, goose! Did you think he’d
be running after a chicken like me?”

“Well, you’ll come again, Mr. Conyers,
won t you ? I do like to talk to someone I
knew in Gunnedah. And I’ll be glad to see
Mr. Bolger any time, tell him.”
An hour later Conyers was admitted into
the farmhouse by the crusty Bolger.
“Wonner ye didn’ put ’n th’ night while
ye wor hart it,” was that worthy’s welcom-
ing remark.
“You must make allowances for lovers,
you know, Rusmus,” said Conyers, malici-
ously.
Rusmus dropped on to. a block at the
corner of the fireplace, and regarded him
with the serious, meditative look of an owl-
“Did'you overtake the gobbler-, Rusmus?”
“Sit ye down,” said Rusmus, motioning
him to the block opposite. He spoke almost
savagely, and for a minute after Conyers
was seated he stared sulkily into the dying
fire.
“Look ye ’ere, Conyers,” he said, pre-
sently, “that gal up yon es good es b’longs
to I, an’ ye ’ave no right to come pokin
abart sp’ilin’ things. ’Tis onfriendly.”
“Well, that’s pretty cool!” gasped Con-
yers, straightening up. “She was my girl
before I went away, as you’re aware, an
you took a mean advantage by makin’ up to
her in my absence. An’ now —-well. !
would never ’a’ thought it of you, Rus-
mus !”
“ITow wor she your’n?” Rusmus de-
manded. “Ye wur never engaged to she;
ye wur never tli’ man to ask she: an’ ye ve
been away these three year. I tell ye, Con-
yers, ’tis I have th’ best right to she. an
I’ll take it as onfriendly if so be ye doan t
disappear in th’ 24 hour.”
“The case seems to be a bit-involved,
said Conyers, grinning. “I thought airs-
Cowdery was th’ peg vou were tryin to

Bolger shot two vindictive side glances at
him, then crossed his legs and stroked nis
chin in silence.

' “An’ poor’s Lazarus,” snapped Bolger.
“An’ there’s you, a slomicky, thick-
headed, ugly old fossil”-
“Don’t be too darn pussonal, Conyers,
Bolger interrupted, fidgeting uneasily on
his block.
“Why,” Conyers went on, it s worth half
the farm to you to get a formidable rival
like me out of the way, an’ have her all to
yourself here in th’ quiet bush. A man that
couldn’t win a girl under those circum-
stances wants pole-axin’. An’ it’s only be-
cause I’m dead pushed, an’ must realise on
the security, mind you. that I’d countenance
such a proceeding at all.”
“I’ll give ye £25 down, an’ £75 when 1
marrv she,” Rusmus bargained.
“Won’t do,” said Conyers, seriously. “Hag-
gling over the price like that is an insult to
Pauline Cowdery. What would she think of
me, selling out for a paltry sum like that?
I’m ashamed of you, Rusmus !”
“Fifty poun’ down,” said Rusmus.
“There ain’t a girl in the district can
hold a candle to Pauline,” Conyers went on.
“She’s a real charm, any way you take her.
Dunno as I ought to give up my claim
at all. ’Tisn’t the right thing to do by her.
Girls fret terrible after a chap they’re shook
on. I must see ’er again first, anyhow. I’d
like one kiss”
“ ’Ere,” said Rusmus, anxiously, “I’ll give
ye £GO now if so be ye sign th’ ’greement, an’
clear out’n ’ere be sun-up to-morrow ’thout
savin’ good-bye. There ye are !”
Conyers considered, while Rusmus pro-
duced a cash bag and writing materials.
Conyers was really in a tremor of excite-
ment at his success, but he was afraid a
too-read.v acceptance would arouse the
other suspicions. He haggled for another
half-hour: then, with much show of reluc-
tance and many remorseful mutterings. as
“Poor little Pauline!—You’ll take care of
her, won’t you. Rusmus ?” he pocketed the
money, and surrendered his privileges in
the following terms
This is to certify that I have received the sum of
£60 4 from Rusmus Bolger, Esq., for my right, title
and interest (if any) in the person of Pauline Cow-
dery, spinster; and I promise ''faithfully that hence-
forth I will not make love to her, or see her, or
write to her; neither will I talk, walk, ride or
dance with her, or connive and covenant with her in
any way whatsoever. God sav§ the King!
(Signed), Matthew Conyers.
Conyers departed north next morning, and
that evening Rusmus Bolger called on the
Cowderys.
“Where’s Mr. Conyers?” asked the
widow.
“Mrs. Cowdery,” said Rusmus, seriously,
“That man be a fraud. He—he —betrayed
ye.”
“Goodness me!” cried the old Hdy, in
shocked tones.
“I didn't ought to tell ye,” said Rusmus;
“but, seein’ as ye be a neighbor”
“Whatever do you mean?” Mrs. Cowdery
demanded, angrily, as Rusmus paused and
made grimaces at the cat.
“He told me, Mrs. Cowdery, that bein’ a
friend o’ your’n, he didn’t care to be pokin’
abart, there bein’ an old love affair ’tween
he an’ she”
“Who’s she?”
“Miss Pauline. An’ seein’ es he be
hooked to ’nother gal up country”——•
He shut up like an oyster as Mrs. Cow-
dery dropped into a chair and laughed heart-
ily. “Oh, the goose!” she said. “As though
he didn’t know last night!”
“Know what?”
“Why, she’s to be married next month to
Mr. Crosby, the station manager.”
Bolger’s mouth opened involuntarily, and
pale blotches broke out on his tanned
cheeks. Mrs. Cowdery was rocking herself
and smiling good-naturedly.
“Poor Mat,” she said, musingly. “He
used to be such a help to us when we were
in Gunnedali. I’m sorry he went away with-
out saying good-bye.”
“That a fact?” Mr. Bolger, having just
now found his voice, gasped out.
“About Mr. Conyers”
“Bart.... Crosby”
‘Oh. yes. Didn’t you know?”
‘’Tis a fact!” Bolger couldn’t believe
it.
, “Of course. Why, what’s the matter,
Mr. Bolger?”
Bolger looked as if he were going to have
a ht. Suddenly he brought his hand down
on his thigh and jumped up.
Aou’ll excuse I, Mrs. Cowdery,” he said,
awkwardly. “I forgot to feed th’ pigs!”
And dabbing his hat on his head, lie retired
in disoider.
A year later Mat Confers received a let-
ter(from Pauline’s mother.
‘You will be surprised to hear that we have
bad a double wedding since you left.” she
wrote. “The contracting parties, as you
will guess, were Pauline and Mr. Crosby,
and myself and your friend of the farm....
Don’t forget to call when you are round this
. w ay, and we’ll have a chat about old times
Gunnedah.—Yours faithfully, Helen
Bolger.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Andronides, sitting on a high stool
before a dripping marble surface just
within the doorway, was perfunc-
torily opening oysters.
It was a somnolent day. The drowsy
hum of insects floated in on the warm,
wattle-scented air, and even “da fry feesh
een da keetchen” gurgled in subdued ca-
dences. In that restful hour both the rau-
cous-voiced boss in the saloon and the sten-
torian, week-old lobster in the window jarred
less violently than usual with their surround-
ings, while the peace of Heaven had de-
scended upon the side of rock cod swinging
idly outside the door.
Andronides slid a plate of oysters over to
the little Greek lad who quietly came in, and
wearily tossed the last empty shell on to the
damp pyramid beside him. Then he half-
closed his eyes.
A flashily-colored fancy vest butted in
through the doorway, followed by the squat,
powerful figure, the hooked nose, strong,
swarthy features, and avaricious eyes of
Asia, when Asia takes up its residence in the
mountains. Sometimes Asia-of-the-Moun-
tains descends, skips across the sea, and
dwells among the people of the plains. And
then it is not good for the people of the
plains. Outback Australia —especially the
women section —will talk to you with spirit,
not unmixed with some fear, about that.
“Hi you dere, ‘steaka-da-oyst,’ ”, jeered
Ghoolab Singh, as he roughly shook Andron-
ides by the shoulder. Get busy. I late ot
started up quickly, and for a
moment the spark of rebellion flamed within
him. For the hand of Ghoolab had been
literally, as well as metaphorically, heavy
upon him, just as it had been heavy upon
all who owned the financial sway qf the
Afghan lord of the principal store in the
township. Andronides, in his own case,
might have agreed with Kingsley s fishermen
that there was “little to earn if there were
not “many to keep.” But, then, again, he
might have added that he only kept one
Ghoolab Singh. However, the challenge in
Andronides’ eyes was only momentary, and,
as he had so often done before, he cringed
before an affluence that was not his, and
bowed down before the truculence of the
alien that owned it. Perhaps when he pos-
sessed —oh, blessed and enchanting dieam.
—an oyster saloon of his own, he might
yes, he would . , . .
" Andronides languidly picked up his oyster
knife and dully opened a dozen more oysters.
As’already remarked, it was a somnolent
day, and the drowsy hum of insects floated
in on the warm, wattle-scented air. I lie
flies buzzed softly, yet ever so musically,
amid the prawns stacked on the table. An-
dronides nodded.
* *
When Andronides realised that instead of
an oyster knife he held a spear in his hand,
he was not surprised. It seemed more fit-
ting, more natural, that his sinewy hand
should confidently grip the long, tough,
weapon which had seen service in m-
cessant border war from his youth up. A
free Greek, his heart was inflamed with
hatred of the traitor Hippias, whom the
restless and daring democracy of Athens
had thrust forth, and he burned with white
heat as he saw before him the motley armies
of King Darius, which had marched against
the devoted coasts of Attica to again bring
his country under the rule of the tyrant.
Yet he was outwardly calm, as he stood with
the warriors of his tribe under the shadow
of the mountains that looked on Marathon,
listening to the talk of the neighbors with
whom he, according to national custom,
fought side by side. He heard how the
Athenian generals—lo in number —were
evenly divided whether to give battle at once
or await the arrival of the Spartan rein-
forcements, and that the vote of Callimachus,
the war-ruler, had not yet been given. For
himself, Andronides had no fears, no hesita-
tion. He felt that he stood on sacred ground,
for Marathon was the scene of many of the
glorious exploits of Hercules and of the
national hero, Theseus. Not yet had the
simple, earnest faith in the Greek myths de-
parted. When the news spread that the
vote of the war ruler had been given for
battle, there was a deep-throated satisfaction,
and in wild enthusiasm Andronides leaped
forward and shook his spear defiantly at the
Tersian hosts. That fateful September
afternoon Andronides numbered one of the
11,000 spearmen who had to decide whether
Europe should be free, or in thraldom to
Asiatic despots. Stealthily crossing the
broken ground, near the base of the moun-
tains, they reached the little plain that
stretched thence to the seashore. The hosts
of Asia were arrayed in all their motley
splendor, with their galleys drawn up be-
hind them on the beach. From Persia, from
Media, from India, from Egypt, from Af-
ghanistan, they had come to humble the up-
start Greeks who dared to thwart the will
of the Great King. For a moment the
Athenians stood still. Then the trumpet
sounded, and the unwavering line of spears
bore down at a run to cross the intervening
distance of about a mile. When about half
the distance had been covered, Andronides,
with that strange far-sightedness that some-
times comes to warriors in the lust of battle,
had already marked out the man—a swords-
man from the Indus —he intended to kill.
He noted the squat, powerful figure, the
hooked nose, the strong swarthy features,
and even discerned the avaricious eye of his
enemy. His grasp tightened on the spear.
All the hate of his soul concentrated in
the desire to kill the man directly in front
of him. As he came nearer, the features qf
ljis personal antagonist seemed, in an ex-
tended, prescient sort of fashion, strangely
familiar. Even when he was within a dozen
paces, his mind strove in a detached sort df
way to elucidate the bizarre impression of
familiarity that had fled across it. But this
was obliterated next instant. A blood-red
mist swam before Andronides’ eyes. All the
energy and power of the warrior and athlete
culminated in the intense ecstasy of killing.
The light target shielding the swordsman’s
body, he knew, would make but small re-
sistance, and already he could feel, in im-
agination, along the muscles of his spear-
arm the soft shock and then the smooth
“sough” as the spear drove through flesh and
bone. At the supreme moment Andronides
leaped ahead, and drove his spear fiercely
forward. # *
A sharp prick on his wrist roused An-
dronides with a start, and he gazed stupidly
down at the oyster-knife which had clattered
to the floor. Before he could recover the
boss tramped heavily in from the saloon,
spluttering with rage and profanity.
. “What da hell !” he shouted. “Here da
customer, ’e wait, wait, wait for da oyst, an’
you no bringa heem. Crish! I tink you goa
tp sleep in da shop. By hell, I giva you da
sack.”
Andronides rose quickly, and, seizing the
plate of oysters, deferentially propelled him-
self up to the table where Ghoolab Singh sat,
impatiently frothing.
“I beg your pardon,” he said humbly.
(Not all Greeks speak the lingua Dago.)
“I am very sorry I kept you waiting. I will
see it does not happen again.”
“Go to blazes,” growled the Afghan, and
Andronides retired obsequiously.
When Andronides realised that again he
held an oyster-knife in his hand he was not
surprised. It seemed more fitting, more
natural, that his strong, sinewy hand should
confidently grip—an oyster-knife.

THE FALL OUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Fair Love and I fell out,
Out of a motor-car;
The maid was hurt;
I scorched my shirt
With the end of my fat cigar,
When Love and 1
Fell, all awry,
Out of the motor-car.
All joy-rides lead to grief,
All barmaids fickle are.
Since Sunday week
We twain don’t speak,
And she snorts at my fat cigar.
She loved me well
Till out we fell—
Out of the motor-car.
Victoria.
When Love anti I first met
She beamed behind a bar;
The band so white,
That held a light
To the end of my fat cigar,
Is bruised and bent;
Hand first she went
Out of the motor-car.
O.K.
The Girls of Piker’s Pub.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Sydney Girl had come and gone.
And let us here confess
That she whs sweet to gaze upon—and
svve<ver still to press.
Her hot !ipf? were as red as wine, and each
enchanted kiss
Was Heaven’s distillation of an undiluted
bliss.
The Melbourne Girl had likewise come, and
likewise had she gone ;
And she, just like the Sydney Girl, was
sweet to gaze upon.
Her speech was wild bush honey. (If it hap-
pened that a sting
Lurked slyly in its sweetness, that were
homage for a king !)
The Brisbane Girl had also come —and like-
wise passed away
As dawning’s crimson colors fade before the
scornful day.
And Brisbane’s sun had turned her cheeks
to just that shade of tan
That hints of tropic gardens—and a serpent
—and a fan !
And Sparkling Eyes from Adelaide, who
brought the scented thrills
Of the warm blue southern waters and the
green Balhannah hills,
Had run the revel of her day before she
sought the South—
Our tributes in her keeping, and our kisses
on her mouth.
And then the Scarlet Girl had come —the
Scarlet Girl whose eyes
Were brighter than Orion's Belt, and bluer
than the skies ;
The wondrous w4ch whose whispered words
were each a fond caress —
The Scarlet Girl whose clinging arms were
warm with wantonness.
Which one of all the five we missed the
most was hard to tell;
For when on§ ( went we learned to love the
other just as well!
But this we knew: when each one left, in
words of stifled pain
We swore we’d never see her likes at Piker’s
pub again!
But yet despite the beauty that adorned the
Camel Hump,
Old Piker’s trade experienced a most de-
cided slump.
The men-moths fluttered round the flame, but
drunkenness was barr’d — _
For he who swanks may never win Delilah’s
red regard.
And Piker’s bar, that was of old the haunt
of human swine, t
Became transformed by magic to a lovers
holy shrine.
The white dust gathered on the shelves; a
red-backed spider spun
A silver web across the tap of Piker’s whisky
tun.
The swagmen came with collars on; the
English jackeroos
Were metamorphosised, and wore then-
patent-leather shoes.
Regeneration reigned supreme; ’twas plain
as plain could be
The Camel Hump Hotel had won Respecta-
bility.
And then the Freckled Girl, whose face was
incarnated pain,
Had come to damp the destinies of that
great wide domain.
Her eyes were colorless and crossed; her
face was the abode
Of concentrated vinegar; and she was
pigeon-toed.
But she was ultra-virtuous. If any sinner
swore,
She’d promptly turn her eyes away, or glue
them to the floor.
The latest yarn from Eastward-110, in
wormwood and in gall,
Was whispered very quietly—if it were told
at all.
And all the while old Piker smiled. For with
unseemly pace
Each worshipper of beauty from his altitude
of grace
Began to tumble hopelessly, and deeply
drank to drown
Regeneration’s chiding voice and Freckle
Face’s frown.
And Piker brushed the dust away. The red-
backed spider paid
The bitter penalty of him who compromises
Trade.
The collars grace the rubbisli-tip; the patent-
leather shoes
No longer hide the bunions of the English
jackeroos.
Now trade is as it used to be before the
Beauties came
With eyes that were as planets are and lips
of honeyed flame;
The girls whose laughing words were like a
lover’s fond caress:
Whose forms were sweet to gaze upon—and
sweeter still to press.
LAND O’ TIIE SUNSET
R.J. CASSIDY.


“That’s for YOU!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BROWN was a cheery little man,
Who sometimes went on jags ;
lie did not drink from glass or can,
But ate fruit out of bags.
Fourteen bananas made a spree;
He loved to get away
And sail the rippling, landlocked sea,
And peel and munch all day.
His heart was full of childish joy,
His two arms clasped a bag
One morn, when, having no employ.
He went upon a jag.
He chose a ferry boat that had
A lengthy trip to do,
And munched it, very glad.
The day was cool and blue.
The boat glode off upon its trip ;
With happiness Brown sighed
And peeled his fruit, strip after strip,
And cast it in the tide.
He’d put a yard of fruit away,
And felt too full to speak,
When into some secluded bay
The ferry boat did sneak.
Upon the jetty stood a crowd
Armed in the usual way;
With bags and billies it was bowed ;
It meant to eat all day.
One being in the waiting mob
Bore nothing he could eat.
(A copper, while upon the job,
Can’t banquet in the street.)
Brown gazed upon the man in blue
With sympathetic eyes;
Then from the bursting bag he drew
A ripe Fijian prize.
He hesitated while the crowd
Was jostling to and fro;
The whistle sounded clear and loud—
They were about, to go!
Then kindly Brown rushed to the rail,
And something waved on high ;
“Hey! That’s for you!” they heard him hail,
And thereupon let fly.
The ripe banana whizzed away;
The people on the deck
Exclaimed as one: “Good shot! ’Ooray!
It husted on ’is neclc! /”
And so it had ! The well-meant gift
Was thrown with too much force.
The half-stunned cop who had been biffed
Was jumping mad, of course!
The boat with poor misguided Brown
Backed from his wrath away :
The laughing picnickers looked down
And once more yelled, “ 'Ooray!”
And while Brown gazed in blank despair,
Volleys of fodder flew,
And scoundrels filled the joyous air
With yells of, “That’s for you!”
The wharf diminished ; the wild cop
Became a raging speck ;
The splendid jest (it could not stop)
Flew round the crowded deck.
Wit pelted wit with picnic fruit;
The revel fiercer grew.
And ev’ryone risked dress or. suit
With shrieks of, “That’s -for you!”
Poor Brown looked on and uttered moans,
Till one with horseplay hot
Remarked in shy, admiring tones,
“That woz a bonzer shot!
“What made yer go an’ do it, mate?
You made that Hop er wreck !
I never seen a better, straight!
Fair on ’is blessed neck!”
He reeled away with laughter weak;
Brown gladly would have died :
He longed to get ashore and seek
Some place wherein to hide.
Meanwhile he tried to bury grief
By eating up his store ;
It took some time to gain relief
For there were seven more.”
And while he ate the Joke progressed,
The food soared straight and true,
And joyous pushites with great zest
Howled gaily, “That’s for you!”
The jest spread when they got to land ;
It made the holiday;
Food-throwing littered sward and strand.
And made dull thousands gay.
The catchword got to town by night.
And raged in ev’ry street;
The stars were hidden by the. flight
Of all things men could eat.
And as each gift with laughter flung
The shadows alimmered through.
The thrower in his joy save tongue
Insanely: “That’s for you !”
Brown took no part in this wild scene ;
He’d had his last fruit jag;
No more he wanders with fourteen
Bananas in a bag.
But when he feels he must break out.
He chews at home in state.
And does not throw the peel about,
But piles in on a plate.
And if you should suggest that he
Might cheer a copper’'- lot
Bv throwing him a large Fiji,
He’ll choke you on the spot.

SEE ivot I picked up, Sam,” said Mr.
Maunder, diving into the recesses
of his coat, and producing a
crumpled envelope.
“’Ullo! bin robbin’ ’is Majesty’s mails,
Jerry?” inquired Mr. Sharp, glancing up
from the news-sheet he was perusing. “That
was a ’angin’ matter not so very long ago,
but you may git orf with ten year ’ard, con-
sequens o’ yer advanced age an’ previous
had character. Wot’s inside of it?”
‘Dunno.” replied Jerry, holding the mis-
sive to the light, and scrutinising its ex-
terior with a lively interest. “It ain’t
stamped, an’ the flap ain’t stuck down, not
to speak of. There, I’ve bin an’ gorn an’
opened it, blest if I ain’t, an’ no damage
done.
Read it out loud, an’ be careful o’ yer
stops, mate,” requested Sam.
Mr. Maunder held the letter at arm’s
length, and hideously contorted facial
muscles which resembled gutta-percha in
their elasticity.
Carn’t make ’ead or tail o’ the blessed
thin’,” he grumbled, after a false start or
two. “It’s wrote that bad I think it’s
about a bloke’s washin’-bill.”
WHAT GAVE HIM AWAY.
CUSTOMER : “I hear that old bloke is a bit of a poet?"
BARMAID : “ Don't cher believe it. He didn't finish his beer."
“Fat lot you know ’bout washin’-bills,”
commented Sam contemptuously. “Washin’-
bill, indeed! You wouldn’t reckernise one.
not if you was to see it. ’Ere, ’and it
over.”
Jerry complied. Ilis companion read and
re-read the note carefully, then whistled.
“’Ow did you lay ’old o’ this ’ere, Jerry?”
he asked.
Mr. Maunder scratched his head reflec-
tively.
“I was walkin’ ’long Silver-street, ’arf
hour ago, wen a fat ole bloke with a big red
conk come outer the pawn-shop left-’and
side o’ the way. ’E were carryin’ a lot o’
letters an’ thin’s, an’ ’e let. one of ’em drop
jest as ’e passed me by ; so o’ course I picked
it up. I thought p’r’aps there might be
money inside o’ it —one o’ them post-office
notes wot you signs yer name to an’ the
young lady be’ind the counter gives you cash
fer,” concluded Jerry, with the candor one
THE MIXING OF MICK.
MR. HOGAN (the friend of the family, intones
of horror): “Mix' bathin? !!"
MRS. BEANNIGAN (who can't find her husband):
“Mick’s bathin' , is he? Wid them brazen
female divils, too!! Faith , it's meself'll be
after bringin' him out!!!"
usually associates with a first rather than a
second childhood.
“You’d 'give any young lady behind a
counter fits if she on’y see yer injer-rubber
face gazin’ insinooatrn’ly in on ’er,” re-
marked the caustic Sam. “Wot kind of a
lookin’ ole bloke was it wot dropped this
’ere, Jerry?”
“Didn’t I tell yer?” retorted Mr. Maunder,
with some asperity. “’lO ’ad a big red ugly
nose, same as a Yid. an’ ’e was that fat lie
took up the ’ole bloomin’ pavement. Dressed
very classy, too. in a ’igh pot ’at an’ a gold
watch an’ chain. Di’mond pin, inter the
bargain, big as the Cohen or —fergit the
other geezer’s name.”
“That must ’a bin old Mo Tushy, the
fence, fer a ’undered quid,” declared Sam,
with conviction. “’E’s very fat —eggstror-
dinary bellycos, as the doctors calls it. Be-
sides, the letter's signed M.T. : it don’t
seem to ’ave no Yadin’ to it. The pawn-
broker’s shop left-’and side o’ Silver-street,
you said, eh? Well, listen to this ’ere:
‘To Bill Pepperall, 101 Emerald-road. You
may give the parcel containin’ you know
wot to the bearer of this note. ’E is a man
I kin trust im—imp—implicitly (wot’s that
mean, matey?) He will deliver it in person
some time during the afternoon of the sth
inst. (To-day’s the fourth, ain’t it. Jerry?)
Kindly ’and ’im the swag. ’Ope you’ll soon
be on yer legs ag'in.—Yours, M.T.' ”
Mr. Maunder rolled a disgusted eye upon
the interpreter.
“Thought there might ha’ bin money in
it,” he grunted.
“An’ so there is money in it —more'n
you’ve ever ’ad the fingerin’ of in the ’ole
course o’ yer misspent life,” responded Sam,
warmly. “I know ole ‘Nosey Mo,’ the fence,
be hearsay. ’ls shop ain’t much to look at,
but ’e ’as the pick o’ the trade, fer orl that.
Pepperall—Bill Pepperall; w.unner if he’s
the Pepperall Mike Williams was tellin’ me
about t’other day—’Otstuff, they call ’im;
’e’s that orright if the tales wot I’ve ’eard
of ’im ’as got any truth in ’em. Look ’ere,
Jerry, it ain’t much arter 12—the whistle’s
on’y jess gorn. You stop here while I slips
round to Emerald-road. I reck’n we’re on
a S°od wicket fer once in our lives, mate.”
“Wot’s the noo idea. Sam V” queried Mr.
Maunder, crossly. “Larst time I let you go
orf on yer own you didn’t show up ag’in fer
three sad ’n’ lonely months.”
“You carn’t expect a cove to twig ev’ry
plain-cloes cop in Melbourne,” expostulated
Sam; “specially wen ’e’s got a safe tip fer-
tile Cup an’ starts shoutin’ long beers.
Once bit, twice shy—they won’t git me on
a string a second time, take my word fer
it.”
“Well, so long as you don’t try an’ be too
clever,” cautioned Jerry.
“Right-o, you jess sit tight, an’ if you’re
a good boy w’en I come back I’ll take you a
little walk as fer as the ‘Feathers,’ pro-
mised Sam, and putting on his hat, he
(piitted the room, leaving Mr. Maunder to
his own meditations.
Apparently Jerry’s thoughts were of a
mundane, not to say larcenous, train; for,
only waiting until his comrade’s footsteps
had died away down the narrow flight of
stairs which led to the street entrance, he
instituted a strict examination of the
pockets of a pair of old pants and an ancient
jacket belonging to Sam. that hung on a
hook behind the door. The search proving
unproductive of anything more valuable
than a battered halfpenny and a two-inch
nail, the Inquisitor stretched himself re-
signedly on his bed, and was soon sunk in
stertorous slumbers.
Sam was absent on his errand nearly an
hour. The first intimation Jerry received of
his colleague’s return to Number 15 Erin-
street came in the shape of an iron-plated
boot hurled with unerring aim.
“Gawd !” gasped Mr. Maunder, as he shot
up in bed with Jack-in-tlie-box-like sudden-
ness. “If I don’t ’ave yer life’s blood one o’
these fine days, Sam, it won’t be my fault.”
“Well, wodger want to lay there snorin’
an’ groanin’ like a man in a appypleptick
fit, wen orl the world but you’s Workin’ ’aid
fer their livin’s?” argued the grinning Mr.
Sharp. “Wot price the little busy bee.

Jerry’s eyes seemed upon the point of
starting from their sockets. “Diekin J

“Fact,” said Sato ; “I took that ’ere note

Sam paused for breath, and Mr. Maunder
laughed a hoarse, derisive laugh, calcu-
lated to wound.
“Dyin’ duck inner thunderstorm,” he in-
terpolated, with the deplorable levity of an
unhonored old age.
“He looks me orl over from ’ead to foot,”
continued Mr. Sharp, impressively, “then

“Wunner ’e ever got ’em back ag’in, wot

put in the irrepressible Jerry.
“Drops ’is eyes,” went on the unheeding
Sam, “an’ ses, turnin’ to the freckly gal

I opens the box to the music o’ yer resound-
in’ snores, Jerry, this ’ere jeweller’s shop-
winder was wot I found inside of it. Now
wot you got to say, matey?”.
“ ’Arves,” said Mr. Maunder, tersely.
Mr. Sharp shook his head sorrowfully a',
this striking instance of his companion’s
cupidity.
“But that ain’t orl,” he resumed, in some-
what chastened tones. “As I come along
jess now, I got another little idea—an idea,
did I say? It were a flash o’ genus, more
like; wot might be called a masterly stroke
o’ strategy. I was in the volunteers one
time, Jerry, an’ if I’d on’y ’ad me doos, I
might ha’ bin one o’ the greatest gen’rals wot
the world ’as ever know’d.” „

save for a prowling dog and a drunken sailor.
From their own point of view, Sam and Jerry
could not have chosen a better time for their
purpose.
Mr. Tushy, propped behind the counter of
the principal loan establishment of the neigh-
borhood, was drowsing over a pile of fly-
speckled documents. Every now and again
lie gave a little forward lurch, and recover-
ing his balance by a miracle of adroitness,
busied himself once more with his voluminous
papers, until his next lapse into a semi-
comatose condition occasioned another brief
interruption of business. It was during one
of these partial returns to consciousness that,
in glancing up guiltily, he became aware of
the fact that lie was no longer alone, lhe
jaunty figure of Mr. Sharp, carrying a hand-
bag, stood between the counter and the
swing-door of the shop.
“Hullo!” grunted Mr. Tushy, suddenly
wide awake. “ ’Oo the ’ell are. you ? V\ ot
d’yer mean by cornin’ creepin’ in on a man
like a—like a” He paused, at a loss tor
a metaphor. « ' J _, ,
“Gentle zepper,” prompted the , poetical
Mr. Sharp, smiling genially. “Its a ill-
wind wot blows a bloke inter a pawnshop,
an’ then on’y w’en ’e’s ’aid up fer a blow-
out.” ” , T , i
“If it’s that coat you’ve got on, I earn t
accommodate you. You’d best take it to the
rag-and-bone shop further down the road.
They ain’t partic’lar,” growled Mr. Tushy,
glancing superciliously over the top ot Ins
spectacles at his visitor’s well-worn wearing
apparel. “While, as fer the rest o yer
togs” ,
“Orright, boss; don’t git shirty, inter-
rupted Sam. “I come on a message from
Mr. I’epperall, Emerald-road.”
“Eh?” ejaculated Mr. Tushy, with a swift
change of front. “From Bill Pepperall, did
you say? Funny enuff, I was jest lookin
through some papers of mine for a lettei
wot I wrote to Bill, but mislaid, careless-
like. Well, wot’s he got to say for himself.
Sam glanced cautiously over his shoulder,
then advanced a step or two towards the
counter. .
“Are we alone, guv’nor?” he asked in a
dramatic whisper. . ,
Mr. Tushy nodded. “Wot yer gettin at ?
he inquired, brusquely. ,
. “Bill’s sent you along a box—a box wot e
sets great store by,” responded Mr. Sharp,
still in the subdued tones of melodrama s
most enthralling mood. ,
Mr. Tushy started violently. ‘ Sent it, as
he?” he exclaimed. “Why, the note I was
alloodin’ to a minute back was wrote, tellin
him to give it to a messenger o mine oo
was to call for it to-morrer afternoon. Vvny
couldn’t he wait till he ’eard from me? Wot
was he in sech a blasted ’urry for?”
Sam shook his head sadly. “Pore Bui
ain’t ’isself at orl,” lie explained. Es
beginnin’ to be afraid as ’ow that ere bad
leg o’ his ’ll carry ’im orf to his untimely
grave. So ’e give the box to a bloke e noo
e could trust, an’ tol’ ’im to bring it round
to you quick ’n’ lively. ’E arst me to ave
an eye to the bearer, ’cos ’e’s an ole man an
ycry easy scared. Sech a job I’ve ad, you d

to jib ; once w’en ’e met a postman in Uni-
term cornin’ round a corner sharp; second
time w’en an elderly ole lady in a bonnet
an’ blue blinkers arst ’im if ’e were saved.
“Got the box —where is he? Why the
dooce don’t he bring it in?” demanded the
fuming Mr. Tushy.
“ ’E’s outside, a-leanin’ up agin the lamp-
post at the street corner,” admitted Mr.
Sharp. “I couldn’t pervail on ’im to come
another step—'e ses ’e’s bein’ shadderedl.
Nothin’ will persuade ’im.”
Mr. Tushy’s false teeth worked convul-
sively in his jaws.
(Click-click.) “D—n Bill Pepperall!”
he gurgled ferociously. (Click-click.)
“Here, stand out’ o my way, you. Leinme
get at ’im—l’ll learn ’im to be afraid of his
own blessed shadder.”
He left his lair behind the counter, and
waddled across the floor like a gigantic hear,
his enormous paunch in front of him.
lie stood in the doorway of the shop,
completely blocking the entrance, and beck-
oned with a huge and hairy hand.
“Hi, you feller!” he bellowed in a voice
husky with wrath. “Wot are you angin
about there for? Come ’ere this instant.
Look slippy now!” (Click-click.)
Jerry gave one startled glance in the
direction of the Voice, then took to his heels
and fled. , _ r ... ,
“He’s bolted!” roared Mr. Tushy, caper-
ing with fury. “Catch him, you—my man s
at ’is dinner. Bring him back or 111 skin
the pair o’ you. Hi, stop! Stop, thief.
He turned an encrimsoned face on Mr.
Sharp. “Catch him —Gaw’s sake!’ he
°cispeu. *
Sam’ wagged his head regretfully. “Sorry,
boss, but I’ve got the rOomatics that bad 1
kin ’ardly walk, let alone run. It was be-
cos o’ the roomatics Bill wouldn t let me
’ump the swag —meantersay box.”
“Then mind the shopman’ be d dto you,
while I cut ’is liver out!” hissed the blood-
thirsty Mr. Tushy, and straightway set
himself in motion.
An onlooker or two, slatternly women
with dishevelled heads and bare mottled
arms, had been attracted by the fierce notes
of recrimination which broke the peaceful
quiet of Silver-street at 2.30 p.m. They
were amply rewarded for their vigilance by
the sight of Mr. Tushy in his shirt sleeves,
as, urged forward by the impetus of his own
momentum, he rolled down the road at a
sort of elephantine jog-trot, the causeway
trembling beneath his pounding footfalls.
The drunken mariner brought a glazed eye
to bear on the portly form of the sprinter.
“Trifle over twelve ’n’ ’arf knots, he mur-
mured incoherently, and relapsed into slum-
ber once again.
Meanwhile Mr. Maunder, despite the com-
bined disabilities of age and corns, had
easily outdistanced his pursuer. fortune
smiled upon him ; he had a clear course. An
officious cur that early joined in the chase
he discouraged with a timely kick, turning
into Prospect Place, he twisted down be-
ward’s liow, and slackening speed as he
found himself nearing home, proceeded at a
pace less out of keeping with his venerable
appearance, until he came safely to the door
of Number 15 Erin-street. He had scarcely
recovered from the effects of an exei cise
more violent than any he had indulged in
since his days of adolescence, when the door
of the room he shared with Mr. Sharp
opened, and Sam himself stood upra the
threshold, a broad grin of satisfaction on
his flushed face. m , ,
“Ole Jerry Maunder fust; Mo Tushy ab-
solutely nowhere —arter bein’ badly left at
the post,” he observed in congratulatory
tones. “Bli’me, mate, I’m that weak with
larfin’ I kin ’ardly stand straight. Why
don’t you offer me a arm-chair?” ,
“Bring it orf orriglit. Sam?” inquired Mr.
Maunder, a shade anxiously. Sam nodded.
“I minded the shop fer ole Bellows while e
was runnin’ arter you Mowin’ like a bloom-
in’ grampus,” he remarked, with a reminis-
cent chuckle. “I’d give a undered pound
down to see ’is fat ole face w’en ’e gits back
an’ finds me gorn.”
“I s’pose you was very careful of orl them
pretty little val’able thin’s o' his, Sam.
said Jerry, pulling off his “Jemima” boots
gingerly. “ ’Oly Moses ! my pore feet am t
’arf swollenI” , „ . „ , ,
“Very careful indeed. I looked arter
them same as a fond father looks arter ’is
on’y son an’ hair,” explained Mr. Sharp, as
he opened the hand-bag and started deposit-
ing its contents upon the table. “Here they
are, Jerry.” .
Mr. Maunder surveyed the growing pile
of plunder with an approving eye.
“Wotches, rings, gold bangles an hetcet-
era,” he said. “’Ope you didn’t fergit to
look in the cash-box, Sam?”
Mr. Sharp tapped his breast-pocket, and
winked cheerfully upon his aged friend.
“Not me,” he rejoined, “specially as the
key was in the lock. I ain’t ’ad time to
reck’n up yet, but it’s mostly in silver. Never
noo you ’ad sech a fine turn o’ speed, Jerry
—you was leadin’ by ’bout ’arf a mile the
’ole blessed way. Pore old Mo ’ad on’y jest
got as fur as Prospect Place w’en I come up
Erin-street.”
“ ’Ow d’you know ’ow fur ’e’d got, Sam,
w’en you was orl that long way orf?” de-
manded Mr. Maunder, as he diligently
' chafed his stiffening ankles.
“ ’Cos I could ’ear his ’eavy pants quite
plainly,” replied Mr. Sharp.
Jerry grinned. “Well, they oughter be
’eavy—they’re big enuff fer two,” he re-
marked enigmatically.

The Weddingcution.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ cry here!” wailed the early
i 1 and irritable barmaid to the figure
1 y of grief strewn on the cushioned
lounge.
The figure stirred and a white face looked
up at her as she hung over the bar. “Where
can I cry?”
“Not in here, anyhow! It’s jus’ horrible
ter listen to yer!” She rubbed the handle of
the beer-pump viciously and carefully avoided
the dumb, appealing glances the mourner
cast after her. *
At last he spoke, slowly and with great
difficulty. “You —never had to —go wed —
weddingcution!”
“What’s that yer say?”
“Weddingcution!”
“What’s that f”
“Exeemarriage— all same thing !”
The barmaid condescended to puzzle over
it for five seconds. Then she waved her rub-
ber despairingly, and turned to her work.
“Oh, 1 don’t know what yer tryin’ ter say!”
There was a thoughtful interval. And then
the man on the bench roused himself again
and muttered, “ You never seen man hung:
“No, and 1 don’t wanter! Ilangin’s is
only fit fer hangmen and reporters! You
never seen a woman at an execution!”
“Lots of ’em!” scoffed the drunk sleepily.
“Gaols full of ’em —all dressed up —hor-
rible !” His chin fell forward on his chest
and he began to mumble a strange mixture
of solemn words: “Man that is born o’
woman hath but short time ter live an’s
fuller misery. He cometh up like flower
an’s cut down in holy ceremony o’ matri-
mony, in presence of large an’ fashionable
congregation. Dearly B’loved, we are gath-
ered together this day to commit body to
earth, an’ may” m .
“Oh, fer goodness sake!” The impatient
barmaid moved towards the door —evidently
to call the landlord; but held back on seeing
two pressmen enter the bar.
“Hello, Tess. Seen Wilson about any-
where? OLord! Here he is!” They made
their way across to the crumpled figure and
tried unsuccessfully to rouse him.
“No use, Jack. (Jo and get a cab and we 11
take him home.” The younger man went
out, and the director of the search party
turned to the girl. “Has he been here long.'
“About an . hour,” she answered wearily.
“I never seen him as bad as this before.”
The searcher looked at the sleeping man
and laughed. “He was down to do the exe-
cution of that chap who died of heart dis-
ease in the condemned cell, and took about
six whiskies to brace himself up. When
the gaol people rang up the office to say the
hanging was off, he was put on to do the
wedding of old Bullfield’s daughter. I guess
the champagne must have finished him.
Right you are, Jack. Just take his other
arm,- will you? Good-bye, Tess.”
“Good-bye,” echoed the girl, as they drag-
ged the limp one forth to his chariot.
Five minutes after they had gone she
noticed a crumpled handful of white paper
lying on the floor. She picked it Up curi-
ously, and, smoothing it out on the counter,
found that it consisted of about 30 loose
slips covered with untidy handwriting inter-
spersed with strange strokes and circles,
and hedged here and there with capital E’s
with their tongues torn out. Without know-
ing that she was handling the raw material
of a daily paper, she planted her elbows
firmly on the counter and started to read: —
PAYING THE PENALTY.
FASHIONABLE WEDDINGCUTION.
CONDEMNED MAN PROTESTS IIIS INNOCENCE
ON SCALTAR.
It was a cold, raw mornoon—the sort of mornoon
when the mist clings like a winding sheet to the city
and the heavy carts going empty to their work
rumble like the tumbrils that rolled through Paris
in the days of the Terror. The large and fashion-
able assemblage of press guests waiting in St. Col-
lection's Gaol, though wtjl wrapped up, shivered in
the cold air, and starced nervousy whenever a war-'
der stirred in the centra aisle. Contrary to the
usual custom, there were a large number of women
present, and many of Ihem were observed to be
weeping furtively. Even the men were deeply
affected. Doubtless the awful court-room scene,
which had rung down the curtain three weeks be-
fore on a healthy young bachelor’s life, was fresh in
the minds of all there. And now they were waiting
to witness the dreadful finale! A few minutes more
and, in obedience to his Judge’s sentence, lie would
be “married by the neck until he was dead.” The
harsh notes of the tolling prison bells, though some-
what muffled by the thick walls, beat ceaselessly on
overtaxed nerves. Heavens! how slow they were!
What must be the feelings of the condemned bride-
groom, waiting patiently in the vestry cell, with the
best hangman’s assistant and the awful functionary
himself 1
A whisper presently ran round the gaol that the
condemned man would not be blindfolded or pinioned,
and that the hangman had not troubled to disguise
himself ,in any way, save by putting on a white
shirt over his ordinary clothes. Scarcely had tin.
witnesses recovered from the shock occasioned by
this astounding rumor, when a trag ! c procession of
three was seen to be shuffling towards the scafaltar.
At the same instant, a shiver of horror ran through
the staring crowd. The principal witness for the
prosecution (a woman dressed in white) swept up
the aisle on the arm of the family solicitor ano
attended by three crying girls bearing floral tributes
for the funeral. Right up to the scafaltar went the
relentless woman in white, and stood like an aveng-
ing ghost by the side of the doomed man. Tin
mumbled words of the burial service were heard, and
a woman —probably some stricken relative of the
condemned —started a shrill keening that sent an
electric thrill of horror through the most hardened
verger. They were adjusting the knot now—the
knot that would put an end to the life he had
.revelled in until the very instant he clapped the
diamond handcuffs on her finger and knew that he
was her prisoner. Though he had never realised it
till that moment, the toils had been closing round
him for months. It was too late to think of flight,
and the evidence was so strong against him that he
had pleaded “Guilty” at his trial, and accepted the
dread sentence of deathrimonv with what resolution
he could command. Only those in the front row
caught his last words —cruelly cut short by the
drawing of the ringbolt. He had paid the penalty
of his crime!
The usual inquest was held later amidst great en-
thusiasm at the home of the bride’s parents. The
evidence, which w;as purely of a formal character,
was both numerous and costly, and dancing was in-
dulged in till a late hour. The jury returned a ver-
dict of accidental matrimony, and strongly recom-
mended the accused to mercy on the ground of his
vouth. His Honor, who was much affected, remarked
before passing sentence that the prisoner had always
been a good son to him, and.... A quiet but pretty
execution took place... .The condemned man slept
we 11....
After that there was a smudge and a blot
and a squashed fly. But the barmaid, who
had been married herself, slowly grasped
the situation. With tears on her nose she
went upstairs and hid the document rever-
ently in her box among the remains of her
trousseau.

THE HAT
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Summer Girl is here again,
And fixing up her flimsy clothes.
There’s washing-frocks on every line,
And rows of vari-colored hose,
While every girl, however plain,
rinds consolation, knowing that
All faces must be buried in
A Great Big Hat.
A point of chin, a glimpse of lip
Is all that she need now display,
Except, of course, a shapely hip,
And something down the ankle way;
For whether eyes be blue or brown,
Or noses aquiline or flat,
It matters nix if they’re inside
The Proper Hat.
The gown, the skirt, the blouse has lost
The pride of place that once was its.
Mere adjuncts of entourage now,
The Hat has knocked them into fits;
They shrink; perhaps they’ll disappear?
For fashion has decreed it, that
No woman can be dressed without
A Hide-me Hat.
The mode that Chidley patronised,
Was nearly it, except that he
Foreswore the lid, and wore his duds
A trifle loose around the knee.
The Summer maiden’s frocks are tight,
However thin she be, or fat;
Her skirts are narrow round the brim,
But not Her Hat.
Observe the men with twisted necks,
One wonders what they have been at;
They did it peering underneath
Her Darned Hat.

And therefore much superior to common
clay!
Yea, I am skilled in that most strange
pliilosophee
Which taketli human morals for its
sainted scope ;
There are not many men on earth like unto
Me—
Wherefore the Universe may still have
faith and hope!
“I will complete the reformation of this
earth,
And of mankind create at last a perfect

That is to say, I will deprive this world of

And write the hymns for groaning Wow-
serdom to sing!
I am, among all men, a most appointed man
To count my neighbor’s sins upon a
knotted string—-
Have faith in me! —Thy prude-like Tresby-

“Each nation of the earth shall be a Sab-

Its penitential tears in many buckets

And o’er the sombre pulpit’s rail of gleaming

I’ll pour my drab Niagaras of mental

Whilst baize-green plates the high-browed
sidesmen slowly pass,
I’ll strangle gladness with a dank and

Yea, spinsters pale shall moan Alack-a-day!

And ne’er a pub on all the thirsting earth

“I' am the Imitation Cockney of the South —
Tliou knowest, Lord, how loyal are my

And tears of unction trickle towards my
caverned mouth,
When I uplift my Dreadnought psalms of
British praise!
I am the blessed Empire’s most important
prop—
Beside disaster’s piles the earth would
stand amaze,
And King and Crown would cease to be,
were I to stop !
“Thou knowest, too, what burden on mine
anguished soul
Is laid by those across this dismal,
narrow sea ;
Beneath my pious Land’s supreme control
This sinful Commonwealth of theirs
should clearly be!
I am the one whose perfect wisdom, pure
and whole,

bitter sin;
Who hath cut off the blessed Empire’s

Yea, even Fisher and his vile Australian

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A DISCREET tap at the door.
“A late hour for a visitor!” I
muttered, looking up at the clock
from my pile of mutilated manuscript. It
was after two —two in the morning.
I had been writing a sonnet. There is a
popular belief that a sonnet contains 14
lines. I had already written 140 lines ; and
the product of my weary pen lay scattered
on my desk, the two chairs of my study and
on the floor; and the sestette was still a
mere mass of corrections. Bad ! Better go
to bed....
I decided to open the door. I would' never
finish that sonnet that night. It was curi-
ous that I never thought my visitor might
merely be my wife coming down to see
whether I had fallen asleep among my
mangled iambics. I rose, tiptoed over to
the door, and gingerly opened it.
A hag—the wreck of some woman of the
street —blinked into my face.
I did not shut the door. I remembered
once—years ago—a woman who had come
thus, and at the same hour, to my door with
her discreet tap—not my suburban door,
but the door of a back bedroom in a cheap
boarding-house. But she had been different.
“Ain’t yer goin’ ter ask me in?” the
woman whined, with a pathetic show of
confidence.
I remembered that I was a respectable
householder, with duties to society. Here
was a member of society, obviously in need
of shelter. It would cost me, perhaps, half-
a-crown. My charity could stand that. The
years had taught me the limit'of generous
instincts. But when that other woman—a
mere -slip of a girl—had tapped at that
other door. .. . ! I did not even have a half-
crown ; but it was not half-crowns that she
had wanted !
“Certainly,” I answered. “But I’m
afraid I don’t know you.”
“Don’t know me?” she laughed, and
choked with a hard cough. Evidently not
accustomed to laugh. No right to be out
so late on a night like this. Her broken
boots oozed. Her draggled feather in what
had once been a hat swayed drunkenly,
dripping. She peered blear-eyed up into my
face as I indicated my desk chair —the only
vacant seat in the room. She would make
a mess of my sonnet, but not a greater mess
than I had made.
‘‘lf I wasn’t certain sure it was you, I’d
be thinkin’, now as I sees yer, that I was
malcin’ a mistake, too. You’re that differ-
ent.” She peered again. “’Ere, I ain’t
mistook the address, ’ave I?” She men-
tioned my name.
I nodded.
“Yes, I knows yer now. But ye’ve got
that fat, an’ lost yer thatch, an’ yer ain’t so
tall as yer was, not by a long chalk.”
“When did you know me?” I asked,
vainly endeavoring to place this battered
hulk in some forgotten sea of my past.
“Don’t ye remember? Yer don’t mean ter

say yer could forget that little boardin’ ’ouse
in Darling’urst?”
“You!” I could not believe it. That
delicious little slim thing that had knocked
so timidly at my door! Her mother, per-
haps? N 0.... “And you’ve come to this?”
I could not help cruelly saying.
It did not hurt her—she was past hurt.
“I ain’t so young as I was, am I?” she
laughed—and choked again with that grim
cough. “But then,” she maliciously whined,
“no more is you.”
“Oh, I?” I apologised. “I’m no longer a
youth. I’m....why, bless me, I must be
mearly 40.”
“You are 40.”
“Surely not. Let me see, my birthday—”
“The sixth of June?”
“You remembered?”, I looked at her
curiously.
“Oh, I always remembers blokes’ birth-
days. I ’as ter in my profession.”
“Well, to-day is—let me see” I
sought my desk calendar. “Why, it’s the
fifth. To-morrow”
“It’s to-morrow now.” She pointed a
skinny claw at my clock. “It’s been yer
birthday fer two bloomin’ hours.”
“So it has,” I lamely admitted. “And I
hadn’t the least idea.”
“I remembered. Yer fortieth birthday ; so
I came”
A flood of sympathy swept through me.
“You came to wish me many happy re-
turns ?”
“No,” she snapped. “I came ter give‘ yer
notice.”
A sudden stream of ice-cold water trickled
down my spine. A cold hand gripped and
held my heart for one beat. I knew I whs
at her mercy. “You’re not going to desert
me?” I cried.
“Ain’t I stuck ter yer all these bloomin’
years, a matter o’ nineteen, or sd?” she
wearily replied. “Did yer think as ’ow 1
was goin’ ter stick ter yer for ever?”
“Of course,” I eagerly answered. “I
always took it for granted that you would.
Wliat did you come into my life for, when I
was a boy, if you ever meant to leave it?”
“Oh, you wasn’t the only bloke I’ve bin
shook on, an’ there’ll be other blokes when
I’m done with you. And a fat lot you’ve
seen o’ me these last few years—since you
got respectable and married. No time fer
me, now yer got the cash an’ yer friends
among the toffs.”
“But I always knew you were there;” I
eagerly said.
“Out in the cold an’ the rain, with you
sittin’ in a warm room!” she cried. “No;
I’m full up of it all. That’s why I took
the trouble to drop in to-night. I’m done
with yer, see?”
“No, no !” I cried, repentant, flinging my-
self at the feet of that draggled heap of
rags. “You won’t leave me mow? It would
be the death of me.”
The old hag smiled sourly. She knew her
uncanny power.
“Why, where'would yer keep me? ’Ere?”
I reflected. No; I couldn’t install her in
my house. My wife and my motherdn-law
would be annoyed.
“There, I knoo yer wouldn’t. You’ve got
respectable, too respectable fer the likes o’
me. An’ I built this ’ouse fer yer; an’ yer
knows it. It’s mine—an’ I could take it
away from yer if I liked to-mcrrer ”
I knew she could. I could sn\ r, •
. No, she said at last, after a long* UDg '
ering look at me. “Per old HmpV 8, , Coll;S1(1 -

I did know it, but I have gone on rof„c-
to believe that such a calamity could happen
sa.tr *-■* w ««
Well, fer the sake o’ the times we ’ad
together, p’raps I’ll look in once or twice
before yer dm. I’m rather interested in that
young nipper o’ yours. I think ’e might like
I started in horror. “My son? You’re
going to” ou ‘ (
“Tap at ’is door, same as I tapped a!
yours? Yes. But not yet awhile. I’ll wait
till ’e’s 21. I likes ’em at 21. They treats
yer well then.”
My courage returned. “Madam,” I said
earnestly, “I would rather that you never
enter this room again, even though I should
miss you like I miss my youth, than that you
cast your cursed spell over my son. I want
to save him from that, at any cost.”
She was astonished, too astonished to be
hurt.
“Ho!” she chuckled, “the proud father!
I’m not good enough for ’im, am I? Good
enough fer the father, but not good enough
fer the son ! But, bless yer respectable ’eart,
’e’ll be glad enough ter take me in when I
knocks at ’is door?”
“Your visit,” I firmly said, “was to me, at
that time, a miracle, a benediction. You
made me incredibly happy; you opened a
new world to me; you fired my ambition;
and all these years you have stuck to me.
If you go, I shall be an old man. I shaii
die soon. I think I have died to-night. But,
looking back, I see now that I would have
been happier, I would have been more of a
man, if you had never come, that cursed
night, that wonderful, ravishing night, tap-
ping so appealingly at my door. I do not
plead for you to stay: though, God knows
how terribly I shall miss you. But rather
than that my son should know of your exist-
ence, rather than that he should grow up with
you, the galley-slave of your beautiful, terri-
ble gifts, I implore you to go, now, and leave
me, a broken, dying man.”
The hag drew herself up; and something
of her vanished beauty of figure seemed to
flower within her dreadful rags.
“So that’s it, is it?” she sneered. “Weil,
yer can take yer choice. I’ve got plenty o
other gents as is glad enough ter ’ave me ter
call on ’em. I’ll come ter yer. like this,
secret—yer wife wouldn’t know—say twice
a year, an’ when yer precious kid grows up.
I’ll tap at ’is door; or I’ll go now, an you
an’ yer nipper won’t never see me no more.
I had scarcely strength to do it; but
“Go!” I said shakily.
She did not move. When I lifted my
averted eyes, I saw her standing, as on that
glorious night when I had seen her first, a
thing of imperial beauty, radiant with im-
mortality, eternally young, eternally seduc-
tive. She smiled triumph ; and at that re-
membered smile the delirium of my lost
youth overcame me. Thus she had dawne l

An Apocajabberlyptiwok.
A FLIGHT of hornSd horses down the
sky!
Trailing the sparks of doom the seas
uprear
Their cloudy crests against the hosts that fly
Poised on the primal rainbow of a tear,
And far apart, in purple shadows drest,
A hoarse lamb coughs within an eagle’s nest.
And she was there. Her silver anklets made
A clashing music in the heavy dark;
Pale heaven opened as the songs that fade
In misty places where the fogs are stark
With incense all embroiled and rolling dim,
Purged to remembrance by the seraphim.
I saw her tremble. But her sins had set
A triple horror on her place of doom,
Where green with slime the mystic books
were wet,
And dread of death had given vengeance
room; . , ,
Yet when the trumpet blew she raised her
head,
Remote and crimson o’er the cross-bound
dead.
I knew her by the wine-press we had trod,
When frothed around her younger feet of
scorn
A purple pleasure with destruction shod
And mirrored in the memory of morn.
But now perpetual patience woke to pain,
Drunken with vanity in web and vein.
Again, the flame-tormented trumpet blew,
Scattering the scurf of horror from its lip ;
The large clouds wallowing in their hoary
dew
Made death’s dark eaves with blood of
woes a-drip,
And on the awful cushions of her shame
She sank into the void from which she came.
Then rolled the wheels of thunder, and the
dark
Gave place to such a glory as ascends
When the clear, sun-fired wing of some thin
lark,
That catches music by its loose-hung ends.
Floods all the morning with a piping shrill
Where the white lambs descend the dew-
washed hill.
A winged youth, with gold hair streaming
wide,
Rode out from Heaven upon a bridled
pearl
Whose ti’embling flanks were gored with
spurs of pride,
And on the stairway of the world a girl
Met him with sweet, red lips, and drew him
down
By his bright hair to bosky places brown.
And through the midst of light and glory
flung
From odorous wings a-flutter in the height
A star upon a silver chain was swung.
So young its crystal breathing was delight,
And from the gold-enshrouded seas awoke
A blare of trumpets making noise of smoke.
A flight of yellow eagles down the sky !
r Trailing new fires of doom the seas uprear
Their cloudy crests against the songs that
die
Poised on the fitful rainbow of a tear,
And wailing darkness, tearing worlds apart,
Sprinkles swart sorrow on one angel’s heart.

The Clock.
WITH a backward glance at the
hours gone by,
The clock creeps on with a long-
drawn sigh....
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo for me, cuckoo for you!—-
So short time left, so much to do !
The virgins falter, the widows wince....
“He’s dead a year, and we’ve not kissed
since!”
A rickety business, the wise declare,
Is life. Let’s live, and begone dull care!
Youth’s morn has sped, but this afternoon
The dusk is warm with a golden moon.
There frisks a jade in a Paris frock....
She glanced this way as she passed—tick,
tock!
There lolls a maiden with eyes of blue....
There’s maybe time for a kiss....
Cuckoo!
Joy calls us still with sweet lips that curl.
The clock leaps on while our pulses whirl. .
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo for me, cuckoo for you!
We’ve time, perhaps, for a thing or two.
The moon is setting behind the hill,
Dark night comes on, and the breeze is chill.
A veiled grey lady goes sweeping by,
And stabs our heart with her sad, cold eye.
Across the world that is fain of sleep
The ancient shadows go forth and weep.
Let’s live ! It’s late, but we’ll not repine...
A willowy waist and a flask of wine,
Two coy white hands of appealing grace,
Two white sweet breasts, and the usual
face !
Let’s laugh aloud in the owls’ despite!
While love stays by us, who fears-the night!
Let’s quench exultant our spirit’s drouth
With draughts of bliss from a yielded
mouth !
Cuckoo for me, cuckoo for you ! —•
The night is starred with a girl or two !
Let’s pluck the heart from each chance

While our co-conspirators croon and cling!
Pierrette, old dear, we have banished pain
Now we’re holding you snug in our arms
again.
No fear can taunt us, no evil shock,
While our lips are one with your lips —tick,
tock!
There’s joy to be had with Pierrette on one s
knee,
No matter whatever the time may be!
The night is dark, but the stars above us
Watch us and urge us and comfort and love
us I
Cuckoo for me, cuckoo for you,
While we warm the night with a sin or two!
Chaste Dian’s abed in her milk-white smock ;
Our raiment is purple as pain—tick, tock!
There’s a dotard waiting just down the way.
His back is bent and his hair is grey.
His hand is shaky, and scant his breath. _
He calls us on. Man alive!.. .it’s Death!- —

A Song of Some Hats.
IAM the manager’s wide-awake,
I shelter the brains of Miljee Lake.
I hang at ease on the office wall
And hear the chippering ’phone-bell call.
I lie on his nose when he goes to sleep,
Dreaming, of dogs and dams and sheep.
It is me he lifts with a lordly sweep
When the ladies of Loondali canter by,
Looking so cool and clean and shy !
I am the ovei-seer’s cabbage-tree,
As business-like,as a hat can be.
I bob in the midst of a thousand head
While he barks like a dog and “strikes them
dead !”
When a colt goes un in a cloud of dust,
And the moment arrives when something
must
Slip or slacken or break or bust.
I’m always the firs,t of the tackle to part,
But that doesn’t rattle him, bless your heart!
I am the,felt of the jackeroo
With a hole in the top where his hair comes
through.
There isn’t a job I haven’t done,
From wiping the oil from his English gun
To flogging his'horse and beating out fires,
And guarding his hands from fencing-wires,
And holding the drink that his dog desires.
And though his hair is sticking through,
lie takes me off to the ladies, too !
I am the “cady” the yarder wears
As he crams the’sheep up the battened
stairs.
Greasy and gritty and foul, am I
As lie waves me about with a whistle or cry,
Or, making a whip of me, slogs and slams
The lazy ewes and the rowdy rams,
Filling the pens with dust and damns;
And it’s me he tosses into the air
When Jhe,.sited cuts, put and the pens are
bare.- ! •'<

WILL OGILVIE.
The Amazingly Successful
Search of Mr. Jones,
Who Discovered in Sydney the Perfect
Woman of Wowser Doctrine.
I KNEW a man whose name was .Tones
(A name that’s common truly)
Who went about with sighs and groans
And vexed himself unduly.
Like 11. B. Irving, he had ways
Uncanny and inhuman;
But he was seeking all his days
(Like us) the Perfect Woman.
Much more particular iu this
Than many a man who preaches,
He thought the harmless picnic kiss
Rubbed bloom off little peaches;
His standards were insanely grim,
For if within the briny
He saw a sunburned maiden swim,
He branded her as Phryne.
Jones had a sister Jane, the pride
And hope of local Wowsers:
All interest had she denied
In creatures wearing trousei’s;
Yet once from underneath her bed
A man crept forth to burgle,
And Jones, with horror, pain and dread
Distinctly heard her gurgle!
There was a pretty housemaid he
Believed Arcadian-simple,
Until one night he chanced to see
This bunch of fluff-and-dimple
Hugging, with every sign of joy,
As hard as she was able,
A ginger-headed Coogee boy
Who worked in Pay ten’s stable.
Then Jones went raving up and down;
He was excited —very.
He looked with hate on Sydney town
And all its damsels merry.
He neighed like some forsaken foal
And cx-ied in anguished fashion:
“Where shall I find a snow-white soul
Un-inked by human passion?”
And just when Jones was like to drop
(He looked so very glum then)
He chanced on Rag and Remnant’s shop—
All right. Emporium, then ;
And in their bargain window, with
A bathing-costume laden,
He saw his dream, his hope, his myth,
His pure and perfect maiden.
Her glance w T as never warm and sly
Though many men looked at her,
She did not give the googoo eye
Or turn to flirt and chatter;
No lover’s hand played hanky-poo
Among her ringlets flaxen;
She was as innocent as dew —
Because she was a wax ’un.
Now every day from nine till six,
If Jones’s boss don’t mind it.
His nose upon the glass he’ll fix
And gaze at Her behind it.
He worships there with fervor true,
Of time and place unheeding,
The only girl in Sydney who
Dreams not of lover’s pleading.

Trains.
A CATACLYSM within his cot,
A wriggle —how the blankets quake!
Our kiddie is awake!
A world of dreams is swift forgot,
And, “Mummy, is it morning-time?”
Would it not be a crime
With that eternity of day —
So time with him is reckoned —
With years and years and years of play,
To waste a single second?
The long adventure is begun,
The life-time that is newly born
Each unexpected morn,
And will through aeons of sunlight run,
Our kiddie’s quick attention claims,
And. “Mummy, I’ll play games!”
With all the day that lies ahead
And all the joys within it,
Too soon will strike the knell of “Bed!”
So. quick ! Enjoy each minute !
No question how ! His mind disdains
llis teddy bear —a childish toy
For one who is a boy.
For all his world is “wailway twains,”
And everywhere he sees the signs
Of unseen tramway lines.
So in the laundry floor the cracks
His expert interest rouses,
And he discovers railway tracks
Upon his mummy’s blouses.
And every object that he sees
Is changed by some obliging Puck
Into a railway truck ;
And when you stand and watch him, “Please,
You’ll get run ober. Daddy ! Back !
You’re standing on the track!”
And lie is driver, engineer,
And guard and engine-oiler;
And when lie’s made these facts quite clear,
Tou find he is the boiler.
The passengers that most he loves
Are, elephants, and dogs, and lots
Of docile liippopots.
They travel in his train in droves;
And when the whistle blows, although
Perhaps you didn’t know,
You find yourself aboard, and with
Collisions looming closer....
Till-suddenly his train’s a myth,
For he’s become a grocer.

ARTHUR 11. ADAMS.
Another Song of General Sickness
and Tiredness.
X’M tired of the cackle of women,.
At home and in politics too
(Of “Labor” and “Liberal” too),
Of the clack-clack-clack-clacker and screamer,
Of the yell, and the Pouter Goo-Goo.
I am tired of the Fearsome 111 Treated
You hear of her everywhere ;
And the Cool One that talks on a platform
Two hours without turning a hair.
She cares not a curse for her country.
She cares not a damn for a cause ;
She knows what a female baboon does
Of politics, justice or laws.
’Tis NOTICE she craves for her antics,
And by her the country is cursed.
(All women are natural liars
But political women are worst.)
Oh, I am tired of the whine of the Griev-
ance —
For ages our spirits have longed
For rest from the rasp of the Nagger,
For peace from the shriek of the Wronged ;
She will swear she was chased with a wood-
axe.
You’ll find out, when all’s done and said.
That her husband’s a mild sort of Snagsby
Who brings her her breakfast to bed.
(To Hell with that breakfast in bed.)
Oh! I’m sick of the book-writing female! —
As often as not she’s a girl
Who ought to be helping her mother
Or putting her hair up in curl.
She slangs all her friends and relations ;
She’s born to disgust and to vex,
She pretends to hate all men like poison
While she raves of the gender—or sex —
(I refer to the Sex-Problem female;
And to Blazes, I say, with her Sex.)
I’m sick of the piffle of women —
The actress who fainted, almost,
With joy at the scent of the gum leaves,
Some hours before sighting the coast.
Of her mouthing of “dear old Australia, ’
Of the Incident met in the Park;
Of the shots that she fired at the burglar,
And that night she was lost in the Dark.
(Small loss if she’d stayed in the Dark!)
I’m tired of the sniff of the Glarer —
And —oh, for our blushes and curls!
The bitter old maids in committee
For the “better protection of girls”—
(Or Females —that’s women and girls.)
They see nought but evil in men’s work,
From babies to laws to provide
For the health and pure blood of a nation —
And, Moses, but they’ve got a hide!
(They couldn’t be mild if they tried.)
And I’m tired of the Ladies’ Committee,
Of the fads and the fashions they hug,
Where the Foundlings go dead or a-missing
While the patroness christens a pug
In the Board Boom got up for the function
With flowers and ribbons and rug;
With cake, wine and tea for the gushers—
No child, but a damn hairy pug!
( -! ***** !!x x x, and the pug.)
I’m sad for the page that is wasted,
Society columns gone mad,
The “Personal” dry hash and rubbish,
The Nobodies wild for an Ad.
The groan of the Dry Female Faddist
Who’d help us all out of our fix.
The “Marys.” or daughters of Empire
And the Mother of Sixty (or Six).
And, lastly, I’m wearied, Oh Bully!
Of the Letters and Chatter I scan.
Of the Blanks who sailed last week for Fog
Land
And the Damns who are doing Japan;
Of the plans of the James Pecksniff-Smith-
sons.
I’m tired —now I rise to remark,
Of Cissy McMullock’s engagement
To the third son of Wallaby Park —
(Who in Blazes is Wallaby Park?)
But I wonder what Asia would think of
This incomprehensible fuss ;
Of our manner of treating our women.
Or the way that we let ’em treat us.
Of our daughters who prance round in
nighties
With hobbles and heels past belief:
Half dressed, but with things they call
“panels”
Like the suit of a cannibal chief —
(Fore and aft, like a cannibal chief.)

SINCE he is mine, why should I miss
My sense of power in giving pain?
I cheat his lips of kiss on kiss,
To bring him to his knees again.

And this new love is merciless,
Wherein my hopes of heaven wane
In restlessness and weariness.

To his wan lips! 1 pray for it!
Her scorn shall'send him to my side,
And he and she shall pay for it!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I THOUGHT shg was asleep. By the
shaded light I could see her piquant face
cuddled into the pillow, with one of her
vo plaits of auburn hair —like a sunlit
stream flowing through a country of snow—
hung smoothly against the white of her won-
derful neck and the filmy lace of her ab-
surdly open-work night-dress. I half-raised
m y head to take in the dainty picture. We
Imd been married only two months; and
e ven three weeks of matrimony—the rest
was honeymoon, which doesn’t count as
lime; no clock has ever been invented that
could measure the minutes —or, is it years?
of a honeymoon —not even these three
weeks of domestic intimacy had sufficed to
render me indifferent to the wonder of see-
ing, regularly, night after night, that ador-
able face on the pillow of my bed.
I shall never forget the revelation it was
to me the first morning I saw my wife
asleep. It was on one of the mornings of
that nightmare of happiness, the honeymoon.
I had wakened early, and, leaning on my
elbow, I looked down on this new creature —-
really, in this respect, a comparative
stranger, who had somehow foi-ced her
laughing way into my life. No man ever
sees his fiancee asleep—or he shouldn’t.
This, of course, accounts for the marriage of
so many girls who snore.
Babette did not snore. She assured me
passionately, and hastily accused me of a
nasal basso that kept her awake for hours
and hours. Now, I know I don’t snore ; this
was merely the woman’s way of making a
countercharge, in the heated defence of
which the original charge will be forgotten.
But her snore was the most charming snore
I had ever heard. I thought so during the
honeymoon ; I think so now. Besides, with
such a ridiculous nose as Babette possessed,
how could she help snoring? It was such
an intimate snore—a gentle soothing whis-
per, like the murmur of doves, or the delicate
music her brushes made as she straightened
out her curly hair, which had a habit of get-
ting all tangled up with crinkly bits of sun-
light.
But I’m forgetting the first time I saw
Babette asleep. She was not snoring then.
As I looked at her I thought, almost with a
shudder 1 , that I had married a child. Her
passive face, lacking the laughter of her
dark eyes and the provocation of her parted
lips, seemed to me the face of some strange
little girl. It didn’t seem quite conventional
that she should be lying so comfortably
there. I could not recognise the grown
woman I had married, nor the soul of the
girl I had wooed —that soul of a wind-blown
flame. She looked so calm, so completely
content,_ so utterly forgetful of me, that
almost in a cold fear at her strangeness I
had to waken her with a kiss. It was my
Babette who came up. like a drowned face,
from the depths of dream. Her slow, re-
miniscent smile brought her completely back
to me.
And now—to get back to where I started.
....The trouble in writing The Book of
Babette is that she is so various, so slippery,
so elusive, that in the act of dipping my pen
into the inkpot I lose track of one of her
hundred aspects, beguiled away by another,
and more entrancing, one. There must be
quite a lot of Babettes in my little inkpot.
You see? She has led me away again!
I noticed now, as I leant and looked at
her, that her night-dress was a new one, with
waves, of little spray-like white silk ribbons
running rippling through its filmy openness.
And the pattern that I saw was not the pat-
tern of the laces, but the pattern in between
the laces—which was Babette. In my
bachelor days, though I had bestowed much
thought upon the subject, I had never
imagined that women need so many night-
dresses. A man, if he is lucky or luxurious,
assesses three suits of pyjamas. But a
bride, so Babette informed me early in our
honeymoon, must have a dozen of every-
thing. It was only lately that I have begun
to comprehend the comprehensiveness of that
everything.” Babette was trousseaued
enough to stand a siege of Troy.
But Babette was not asleep—though she
certainly ought to have been, since it was past
midnight, and we had said good-night half
! ln hour ago. I could tell that by her breath-

and the bedroom. Babette is certainly
not tidy. I can’t get her to hang her things
up and there are so many things to hang
up. She just throws them anywhere, like a
tired child when told to put her toys away.
I wonder if all wives are like that. There’s
something communal in wives, I think.
I here’s not a single thing in the house that
is sacredly mine, except my towel and my

robes are hers, and every square inch of the

‘‘Haven’t the least idea,” I assured her.

“Airy.”
“It’s" a summer nightie, silly. Hand-
worked, too, all of it.”
I had learnt woman’s incomprehensible
adoration of hand-work. I had had two
months’ tuition in its intricacies. Why
woman should go to the trouble to make
hard knots and edges in her night attire
when she could have it comfortable and plain
and free from draughts, no husband has been
able to find out. Though, to be sure, most
husbands prefer them that way. But a man
does not put knots and ribbons and bows in
his pyjamas. But then no male is fool
enough to wear things. all day that leave a
criss-cross pattern on his back when he takes
them off at night. Scientists tell us that the
female bears pain more easily than the male
because they haven’t such delicate nerves.
Consider, for instance, a man with toothache
I. have already tried to explain this cold
scientific fact to Babette; but, so far, I am
not sure that I have convinced her. She
says that it is because men are such cowards,
while women are uncomplaining heroines.
“But you only noticed it just now?”
Babette complained.
“Hadn’t time before. I really didn’t see
the nightie. I only saw you.”
“Is it so open-work as that?” she gasped,
with a thrill that was not of shame.
I explained foolishly, to her evident disap-
pointment, that that was not what I had
meant. I told her that men do not notice
details in a woman’s dress, or comparative
lack of dress— they see only the woman in
the dress. And that, in this case, the wearer
of the lack of dress was worth all the atten-
tion I could concentrate on any object for the
next ten years.
It seemed to console her. 111 have to re-
ward you for that.” she said, and leant over
and kissed me —the commonplace kiss ot
married life —the sort that so easily, so com-
fortably, fills in the pauses.
“But it isn’t about your nightie that you
wanted to ask me,” I reminded her, as she
settled back comfortably on the pillow.
She brought her mind back, with an effort,
from her reverie on night dresses: and a
serious look came oddly on a face that was
not meant for seriousness. <
“Certainly not,” she said. “Dearest, it s
a most important thing ; but I think that as
your wife I have a right to know.
I braced myself. A dozen inconvenient
things that she had a right to know flashed
through my mind.
“What is it?” I asked warily.
She was still sufficiently a bride to blush.
“About the the other women you’ve
loved.” she whispered. .
“Oh !” I muttered, making a hurried men-
know about them all,” she went
more confidently on. “I’m your wife now,
and that’s all done with, isn t it? So you
can be quite frank, can’t you?”
I could be; but the agitating question I
had to settle was whether I could afford to
be
“Well?” she added, as I was cataloguing
mv exhibits. , ' _
'“You want to know about them all? I
ventured, to gain time.
“Oh!” she cried excitedly, “were they all?
So many as that!”
“No, no,” I hastened to reassure her. Of
course an unmarried man meets a lot of
girls ; but he can only marry one —at least
one at a time.”
“But I want to hear about the others.”
“The others don’t count.”
“Of course they don’t count —now. she
admitted happily. “But I’d so like to hear
about them.” She was quite wide awake
now. And it was getting on toward morn-
ing. There was nothing for me to do but to
bring forward some of the nicest samples.
“The first,” I began, “was a school-girl.”
“I don’t want to hear about school-girls,”
she petulantly said.
Which was lucky for me. “Pass the
school-girl,” I said, relieved. That particular
school-girl had been —but Babette did not
care about her. I hurried on. “There was
Mabel”
“Was she pretty?”
“All of ’em were pretty,” I replied.
“You mean, you thought them pretty—
then.”
“No; they were pretty, but not pretty in
the way you are.”
“What was she?”
“She was a typewriter clerk in the same
office. I can’t have been more than 21.
Good figure—rather too good figure. Curvy,
convex, plump, you know.”
Babette settled her. “Fat!” she said.
“Perhaps ; but I think I liked that sort in
those days.”
“I’m glad I didn’t meet you then,” sabl the
slim Babette, whose body has been, I believe,
specially constructed for the modern dress
by a beneficent Providence. “Well?”
“One day she asked me if I could fix her
typewriting machine. It was just five
o’clock, and she had to do an important let-
ter before she went. And her machine had
jammed. I waited behind to help her—she
was one of the helpless sort —infantile and
appealing, I thought her. All the others
had gone. I knew less about typewriters—
and other things—than she did. I couldn't
find out what was wrong until Mabel bent
over me to show me. It appeared that what
was wanted was merely the application of
my lips to hers.”
“Beast!” said Babette. I do not know
whether she meant me or Mabel. I thought
it better not to find out.
“She kissed me back, of course,” I con-
tinued. “And I saw her to her ’bus. And
next week I took her. on the river. I was
rather shy, I remember, and very excited and
proud. There seemed to be so much of her
for a thin young man like me to take care
of. And in the boat —we tied it up under
some willows —she kissed me —pretty fierce
it was. But, somehow, it frightened me,
being made love to. you know. She never
came out on the river again with me; and I
didn’t know whether I was heart-broken or
relieved when she left the office for another
position. Glad, and yet terribly sorry, you
understand. I found out afterwards that
she went away to get married to the head-
clerk in our office. And one of the other
clerks told me that he had seen her with him
trying to mend her typewriting machine on°
afternoon after all the others had left. I
daresay I was a young fool.”
“No,” Babette said fiercely, “she was a
horrible woman, and you were lucky to get
out of her clutches. Why, she might have
married you!” She had a moment of con-
templation of the dreadful possibility. “Was
she dark or fair?”
“Yellow hair. I rather admired yellow
hair in those days.”
“I suppose all boys do,” Babette said com-
fortably, armored in her bronze. “Was that
all?”
“All with her.”
“But the others?”
“Peagy. I think her name was—or was it
Polly?” I could not for the moment remem-
ber. “No: Polly came later. I met Peggy
in a fog. We were out in it one afternoon,
and we had both lost our way. She ran into
me under a lamp-post, and asked me where
she was. And when I made her out, with a
kind of halo about her—from that lamp
above —I didn’t know exactly where I was.
I offered to take her home, and somehow we
found ourselves in the park. We could not
even find a seat. So we sat down in the damp
grass and I made love to her.”
“Ooh !” Babette made the noise that you
utter when you turn the cold shower on.
“And you’d only just met her?”
“But it wasn’t in a world of convention
that I had met her,” I exclaimed. “It didn’t
seem to be in this world at all. The fog had
changed everything, shut out everything.”
“Well, and then?” Babette braced herself
to get this unexpected tooth pulled.
“That was all. I never saw her again. I
often looked for her. She never turned up
at the corner where she had promised to meet
me the next night. The fog had gone by then
—perhaps that was why she didn't come.
And I wouldn’t have been able to recognise
ner again. I had forgotten everything anoui
her except her hair aDd her mouth.”
“Go on.” Babette whispered desperately.
“Polly.” I ticked her off. “Polly was the
sweet, clinging sort, like treacle. She used
to weep silently and hopelessly. She had-
great big eyes that looked enchanting with
tears in them. She was engaged to a friend
of mine—and she was going to keep her
sacred promise. She used to come and tell
me all her doubts whether she loved him
enough. I used to soothe her with kisses.
She was the sort that always wants kisses
—and it doesn’t matter much where they
come from. Oh, she mariied him all right,
but a week before we had a weepful fare-
well ; and a year later she wrote and told
me she had made The Great Mistake, and
would I meet her one night at the old corner?
I didn’t, because at that time I was inter-
ested in a girl on the stage—at least, she
had been in a chorus once and wanted to
get there again. Maisie, her name was. She
told me soon after that she had been mar-
ried for six months.”
I paused. It seemed to me that Babette
had had enough for one night. The rest of
the catalogue would keep.
“Was that all?” she said.
“As far as I can remember.” I replied.
“Of course, there was an occasional kiss at
a dance, you know, and one, I remember, in
the stairway of the Twopenny Tube, about
100 ft. below the street. And on my holidays
at the seaside there was the usual assort-
ment of hurried affairs that ended in drib-
bling letters a few months afterwards.”
“But these weren’t serious?”
“No. I’ve forgotten their first names —I
never knew their second ones.”
“But surely you’ve had a real affair? All
these were mere flirtations, weren’t they?”
“There was one,” I said slowly. “She
really mattered, and she was the most beau-
tiful of the lot. I didn’t like to mention her
with all the others.”
“Oh, but you must!” Babette sat up in
bed.
“Well”
“Go on,” Babette harshly commanded.
“Did you?”
I nodded.
Babette clehched her little fist; but she
was no coward. She would face it out.
“I married her,” I smiled.
I do not know whether Babette was the
more relieved or the more disappointed. She
had expected revelations. Her curiosity was
distinctly hurt. “So that’s all?” she said at
last.
“It’s the story of any average young man’s
life,” I said.
“I am disappointed,” Babette said at last.
“I thought from something in your eyes, and
the way you used to look at me when we
first met, that you had been much worse. All
my girl friends told me you had been a ter-
ror with women. That’s really why I took
to you at first sight.”
I rapidly considered whether I had better
tell her about Gertrude... .or, possibly Lola,
especially Lola.
“You see, I wanted to marry a man, not a
milksop,” my wife said. “I really think
you’ve married me under false pretences. I
believe I could get a divorce for that.”
But there was a radiance in her misty
eyes that told me she didn’t mean it. I
carefully covered up Gertrude and the re-
markable Lola from sight. They were the
sort of exhibits that are not read out in
court but handed up in writing to the Judge.
“But you’re an old dear,” Babette smiled.
“I’m not really disappointed ; but you’ve had
a rather tame sort of existence. If I were a
man I’m sure I’d have something more to
confess. But you’ve liked a lot of girls, ahy-

angry if she saw you.”
TOMMY : “Not at all, not at all, my dear.

how. And they’re all a kind of compliment
to me. You see, you married me, and you
didn’t marry the others. And I daresay some
of them were much prettier than me.”
“Yes,” I admitted.
She became distinctly annoyed.
“But in a different way,” I soothed her.
“And I wouldn’t look twice at them now I
know how beautiful a woman can be.”
Babette was content. “You’re a dear old
thins:.” she sighed; “and I don’t think you’re
a milksop at all. How could I—now?”
HENEY JAMES JAMES,


An Adventure in the Park.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I MET a devil in the park.
A devil fair and kind,
Who looked red-hot against the dark,
But bore an open mind.
He linked a kindly atm in mine,
Ilis breath was on my cheek—^-
A breath as of a porcupine
Bathed in a burning creek.
We strolled beside a wilding bed
Where flaunting lilies grew,
And Captain Cook upraised his head
To crown it with the dew.
And as we sauntered through the gloom,
•j And night my devil fanned,
Before us like a bush in bloom
1 We saw an angel stand.
An angel very tall and fair.
With wings and crown complete;
An angel wearing purple hair
And dainty sandalled feet.
An angel with large eyes of blue,
And dimpled cheek, I wis,
And lips that almost seemed too new
For any wight to kiss.
The prancing devil at my side
Crouched low in horrid fear,
Until upon the midnight tide
Her angel laugh rang clear.
We heard her laugh—a pleasant trill
As when in shades withdrawn
Some nectar fountain learns to spill
Its gladness to the dawn.
I caught in mine her slender hand,
1 drew her arm in mine.
Iler pinions light my whiskers fanned
As corkscrews tickle wine.
Straightway my soul grew glad and faint,
I felt a light appear—
The splendid halo of a saint
Above my sins and beer.
The angel hanging on my arm,
The devil at my side,
We three amid the shadows warm
Went down the pathways wide.
The angel was a merry spright,
The devil’s eyes were kind.
We sang in chorus to the night,
Which did not seem to mind.
We caught a lonely spirit car,
We paid a spirit fare,
And floated tethered to a star
Along the streets of air.
And somewhere in the Milky Way
We found a tavern bright.
Where cheerful revellers might stay
At wassail all the night.
And there we pledged a merry glass
To Earth, and Ilell, and Heaven,
And watched the shining planets pass
' Until we counted seven.
Then dropping down night’s purple dome,
That fiend and angel sweet
Through leagues of ether took me home
' To my suburban street.
They tucked me softly in my bed.
And with a last farewell
The angel vanished overhead,
The fiend went down to Hell.
But woe is me, while earth goes round
I dwell a soul accurs’d.
For surely they have left me crowned
With an immortal thirst!
N.s.w.
PAT P’MAORI.
The Jamboree.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f~ HAVE been married over six years, and
I . never, till this unfortunate occurrence
had there been an angry word between
us. And now it seems that there is
nothing for it but separation. My friends
say my wife is very overbearing—tyrannical
iff fact, and that the only reason there have
not been devilish rows before is that I
have acted the worm, and allowed her to
run the house and myself as well. I cer-
tainly have made a practice of giving way
to her; it seems .to please her to have her
own way, and as I don’t care much what
we do, or how we spend the time, as, long
as I am in her company, I really fail to see
that I have been guilty of wormy conduct.
I swear I had no intention of thwarting
her on this occasion. It was the work of
F&te, aided and fostered by Ernie Stubbs;
though, mark you, Stubbs, did not delib-
erately hash things up. lie is in almost as
big a row as I am.
Some time ago my wife decided she Would
like to have a garden—three gardens, in fact,
fruit, flower and kitchen. So we got a
charming little place at Myosotis, a model
hamlet just off the Parramatta line. It
was a delightful home, and as the people
who preceded us had gone in extensively
for gardening, my wife was in the seventh
heaven. Unfortunately, we also had the
finest tennis court in the district.
The new home struck me. as an ideal
place for a man whose work is described, by
courtesy, as literary. “Here.” said I to
myself, “on Sundays I shall sit beneath my
own orange trees, ‘the world forgetting,
by the world forgot,’ and make fame and
fortune spinning delicate romances that
shall charm all readers with .the dainty
atmosphere of Myosotis.”
So 1 was a little bit disappointed when
the Best People came along and roped my
Wife into theif tennis club, apd announced
that they always played their tournaments
on our court. In less than six weeks she
was the queen of the place, the combination
of her imperial beauty and our perfect
tennis court downing all rivals. In grateful
acknowledgment of the high honor paid her
my wife announced that she Would donate
at least two handsome prizes and provide
all the refreshments for the championship
tournament.
This blessed tournament happened last
Saturday afternoon —and I was not there.
Myosotis had expressed itself as dying to
meet ine, and I deliberately stayed away.
Myosotis society felt aggrieved, and my wife
says my conduct has destroyed her social
supremacy.
And yet, it all happened simply enough.
A few minutes before 1 p.m. my wife rang
up and reminded me that the train left
Sydney at 1.30 p.m. sharp, and on no account
was I to miss it. To avoid being kept by
some late caller on business I left the office
at once, and as I hate waiting on the rail-
way station, where a man is always liable
to be walked on by some fat dowager loaded
up with carry-all, hat-box. and miscellaneous
parcels, rushing to catch a train that has
gone half an hour before. I dropped into
Hinkler’s Fern Bar to kill the 30 odd
minutes I had on my hands.
Hinkler’s Fern Bar is ah ideal institution.
It is at the rear of the premises—a cool,
green pleasaunce of fern trees and pot palms,
with .a dripping fountain in the centre. The
bar is hidden away in one corner, and the
scats, all shaded from sun and rain, are
dotted round under the fern trees. It is a
place conducive to thought, and many
solemn and profitable thinks I have done in
its shady recesses.
Unfortunately Ernie Stubbs, who was
already at loggerheads with his wife, had
dropped in there to think out some way of
making peace without appearing to give
way. And he was deep in thought when I
ambled in and ordered some light Scottish
wine.
He greeted me with a loud howl, waved
me to his table and commenced to lay Ins
troubles on my shoulders. I was a mag-
nificent liar, he said, as all good journalists
have to be, and he wanted me to use my
imagination, and find him a way by which
he could both get out and save his face.
“Look here, Ernie, I have to catch the
1.30 without fail —wife has a tennis party
on. You can tell me on the way. to the
station.”
“Orright, there’s plenty of time. Let’s
have another drink, and then we’ll blow
along an’ I can tell you as we go.”
So we made over to the bar and hastily
drank our whisky and soda. As we turned
to leave, the door flew open and Turnbuil
dashed in. and spreading out his arms
caught us both, and by his huge weight
swept us back to the bar.
“Sorry, Turney, but I’ve to catch the 1.30.
and Stubbs wants to tell me something as
we go along.”
“You’ve tons of time —and you’re going
to have one with me. Gosh, but I’ve just
made a pot of money. The occasion calls
for the best —for wine, in fact. Ho. there.
Beauty, a bottle of champagne; largest and
best bottle in the place. Lord save me soul,
it’s easy to make money so long as you’re in
THE HEATHEN IN HIS BLINDNESS—“PUTTING HIS ‘POT' ON.”
the swim. That’s the secret —get into the
swim.”
“What have you pulled off, anyhow?” we
inquired, simultaneously.
“Too long to relate as you have to catch a
train. Have dinner with me Monday night,
and I’ll tell you all about it. Ah, here’s the
booze!”
Then we went out and scrambled, on to a
tram labelled “Railway”; and as we had 10
minutes to spare and tlie journey occupied
bnly seven, we felt at peace with the world.
Stubbs even forgot about his matrimonial
troubles.
A frightful explosion raised our back
hair and the tram came to a standstill with
a heavy, jarring noise.
THE SIMPLE SAVAGE.
TOURIST (cordially): “ Haw—bai jove! Tena koe! Kia Ora !”
MAORI YOUTH (coldly): “How d' yer do?”
“Fuse blown out!” said Stubbs. “They'll
be off in a couple of minutes. We’ve plenty
of time.”
But the riot in the street told us some-
thing unusual had happened, and when we
looked out it was to see a crowd scattering
as though the Devil had suddenly appeared.
“The overhead trolly-wire’s busted,” said
the conductor, “so if yous w T ant to catch a
train you’d better make a dash for it.
Ketch a cair in George-street.”
We thanked him and got out. Not a cab
in sight. We wandered down to George-
street, and just missed one tram, and the
next was blocks and blocks away.
“Again we’re done,” said Stubbs. “Not a
car anywhere and nary a cab either.”
“Better hoof it, I think,” I suggested.
“The car will overtake us —I think you 11
just about do it.”
The car came up. Every inch of toot-
board was crowded. In vain we fought for
a foothold, and just as we were making an
impression, having got two other fellows off
by the simple expedient of tilting their hats
overboard from the back, the tram started
with a bound and spilt half a dozen of us in
a heap. Another was just behind; but being
loaded to the gunwale also, the driver ran
through the stopping. Then, we, mad as
hatters, made a sudden break for the station
on foot. As we reached the steps we were
caught in the middle of the congestion, and
swallowed up. When I managed to break
out of the mob and make for my platform I
saw the tail end of the train slithering away
in the distance.
“When’s the next?” inquired Stubbs.
“Two o’clock!”
“Oh, that’ll do all right—you’ll only be
half an hour late. Let’s go and have a
drink after that violence. Gosh, I feel ready
to drop.”
I felt the same myself, and we tripped
down a side-way and broke through the mob
surging up by sheer force of gravitation.
When we got to the bar we sank down on
the lounge and fanned ourselves vigorously.
After we had saved our lives twice Stubbs
remarked that although there was stiil
quarter of an hour to go it might be well
to get back, and we rose. Just as we did
so Tyrell and Baker lurched in, and Tyrell
said it was his birthday. We must drink
his health; and lie was catching the. same
train as myself. In fact, he was coming to
the tennis. He had been on the same car,
and had missed the same 1.30 owing to the
same cause. He told how he had got on to
a George-street tram, and was hanging on
to another man’s coat by his _ teeth, with
one toe on the footboard, and his other arm
twined round somebody standing up inside
the car.
“Why did you get off?” I inquired.
“I had to. Some thieving hog tried to
take me down for me hat, and tilted it oit.
So of course I wasn’t losing a 30-bob
Panama for the sake of half an hour, and
swarmed off. The thief must have se.en me
flop off, as he never attempted to pick up
the tile. I walked up. Here’s happy days.
When we got to the staircase it was as
congested as ever, and it took us nine
minutes to reach the platform. There was
no train there.
“She’s late —it’s two minutes to two
still,” said Tyrell. “Parramatta train
late?” he inquired of a porter.
“Parramatta train starts from No. o, Sat-
urdays,” said the porter.
We plunged and battled through the
awful crowds for No. 6; but a racing mob
was making for No. 4; and it was like ford-
ing a river to get through them. Tyrell was
beginning to fail under his load of wlnskj,
and I had to help him along. Stubbs said
he would help me, and somehow or anotnei
we got through it. A train had just arrived
at No. 7, and the horde off it was pouring
through the gate of No. 6 as web as tii
wicket that is supposed to serve Ao. t. )
' heard a whistle blown, and as I dashed on
to the platform, dragging Tyrell with me, r
saw the train right against the end ot t
platform. I threw Tyrell into a carriage
and swarmed in after him.
“Hooray!” said Stubbs, “won by. a nose

n d o ur friend here is a bit screwed (slip-
ping half a crown into his hand). Is there
any quiet place you can get him into where
he can have a snooze till we get something
to eat?» We’re going by the 2.52 Parra-
ffl“Oh yes, I think so. Get him out an’
follow me.”
We yanked the protesting Tyrell out, and
dragged him in the wake of the porter till
we reached a doorway, and there the porter
stretched out a long, strong arm, and Tyrell
disappeared. We waited a few minutes for
the porter to reappear to tell us how to get
hold of him again, and then, the pangs of
hunger returning, we hurried away to the
refreshment room.
At 2.45 we went to look for Tyrell, but
could find no trace of him. I became very
anxious. At last we unearthed the porter,
and asked for Tyrell. He looked surprised.
“lie’s all right, gentlemen; he won't
worry you any more. He’s fixed.”
“Fixed where?”
“In the jug, of course. You wanted to
lose him, didn’t you?”
“Of course we didn’t want to lose him —I
want to take him home. Where is he?”
“Fast asleep at the Central by this time.
I thought you wanted to drop him without
leaving him in danger. You can’t have a
drunken man running loose round a place
like this, you know ; an’ I thought you gave
me half a caser to get him run in fer his
own sake to save you the unpleasantness.”
Half dazed by this fearful announcement
I gazed across the wilderness of platforms,
and saw, without surprise, a train steam
away from the top end of No. 4. I had
missed the ’bus again.
“Look here, old man, you catch your
train, and I’ll get him out, somehow.”
“My train’s just l gone,” I said. “Excuse
me while I swear !”
Then a girl carrying two tin hat-boxes
filled with gold, judging by the way the
impact barked my knees, crashed between
us; and Stubbs, stumbling back, was smitten
in the hocks by the sharp edge of a heavy
typewriter a weedy youth was staggering
alongwith.
, hy the h don’t you look where
.voure going, you clumsy lout?” he howled
as he grabbed his legs with both hands and
rocked himself in his agony.
The perspiring youth banged the type

MARIE : “Eva is older than she looks."
GERTIE : “Hardly that. You mean she is
older than she dresses."
He also endeavored to reassure me by telling
me it was the last train, and that all hotels
had been closed nearly an hour. That satis-
fied me, and I turned my face from the light
and settled down for a little nao. I knew
the stopping of the train at Strathfield would
awaken me, and then I would stay awake till
I got home, i put out my hand without
opening my eyes to make sure Tyrell was
there, felt his shoulder, and dozed off.
Then I opened my eyes and looked up. It
was a youth in a porter’s uniform, armed
with a broom, who had roused me*
“All out here, please V” he said smilingly.
“All right—is this Parramatta V”
“Parramatta be blowed —this is Penrith!”
“Penrith!” I echoed.
“You’ve struck it right the very first
time!” he repeated playfully. “Did you
want to get out at Parramatta?”
“Yes, I did.”
“Well, you can to-morrer, about 11 a.m.”
Just then the figure beside me arose and
angrily demanded what the row was about.
But it was not Tyrell—it was Stubbs.
“And you promised me you would go
straight home,” I said reproachfully,
“Well, I will as soon as I get back. The
taxi’s waiting and the fellow knows me, so
he’ll wait all right.”
“Well, as he will have to wait till about
mid-day to-morrow, I guess you’ll have a
dandy bill to pay,” I snorted.
Then Stubbs made a few remarks on his
own account, and we got out on to the plat-
form. Here we found a Good Samaritan,
who offered to find us one place where we
could get three drinks, and another place at
which two beds could be obtained. We
started immediately.
We had just arrived at the place where the
drinks could be obtained when we heard the
chug-chug of a motor, and next moment it
swept round the corner and came straight
at us. We greeted it with cheers.. The
driver pulled up,
“Say, is there any place where a fellow can
get a drink, boys?”
So we made a covenant with him. We
would obtain drinks, and he would drop me
at Myosotis, and Stubbs he would take on
to Sydney. So we made haste, and came
back with two bottles of whisky and several
syphons. Then, having saved the life of the
motorist, and rewarded the man who had be-
friended us, we started at 23 miles per hour
for home. I wrapped myself in a rug and
went to sleep.
* * * #•
I was awakened by a pain in the small of
my back, and found myself lying on the heel
of Stubbs’s boot. The car was 'canted over,
and, as well as I could make out, was at the
bottom of a bank with its nose half-way
through a wire fence. I had got off the heel
of Stubbs’s boot before making this discov-
ery. Stubbs seemed to have turned a com-
plete somersault and to be lying on the
bottom of the car, face downward. The driver
was lying on his back in the bucket seat,
with his legs round the steering wheel. Th?
whole arrangement struck me as out of
order.
As the driver declined to wake up, I tried
Stubbs. He was afraid our confidence had
been misplaced ; and, when we examined the
bottles, we found it had. Only two nob-
blers were left. We drank them, and then
dragging the driver out of the seat, I set
the car going. Nothing was broken, and
it was evident he had stopped the engine
when he went over the bank. After a few
desperate efforts the car snorted up on to
the road, and we once more started for
home through the starlight.

last I pulled up.

town. Somehow, it seemed strange to me
so 1 concluded I had run partly round and
entered by a way unfamiliar. Suddenly
Stubbs looked up, stopped, and stared round.

He ll do anything for me, will Old Charlie.
Well, well; fancy hitting Windsor !”
kox tunately the “old pub” was not very
far away, and after getting mist some recent
additions and improvements Stubbs reached
the ladder of the loft where old Charlie slept.
Suddenly the air was split by a frightful
commotion ; there was a heavy thud, followed
by another; and then Stubbs darted round
the corner of the building and gasped : “Run,
lies got the axe; run like the Devil!”
And suiting the action to the word he van-
ished. I thought it was time to do likewise,
and just, as I scrambled over the fence into
the street an infuriated Chinaman appeared
on the scene with a meat cleaver. I never
knew I had such a pretty turn for speed. I
saw Stubbs in front and settled down to
overtake him. He heard the thunder of my
hoofs behind him and finding he was being
overtaken he suddenly stopped, picked up

some blue metal from the street and faced
round to make the best tight possible.
It seemed he had failed to knock Old
Charlie up and had ventured inside, and
instead of Old Charlie it was young Ah Foo,
who rose with a yell of fright and reached
for the meat cleaver he kept to welcome
burglars with.
We were still getting our breath when
two policemen and Ah Foo suddenly ap-
peared and approached us cautiously.
“Halloa, Pat! Ilow are you?” said
Stubbs, holding out his hand without ris-
ing and nodding at the biggest policeman.
The policeman regarded him coldly. Then
a gleam of recognition flashed over his fea-
tures.
“Great Scott —is it you. Mr. Stubbs?”
(Then, turning to the Chinaman.) “I.uk
here, ye haythen. phwat’s the mayning av
this unseemly joke? A bug-ler, j-e said, ap’
it s MY. Stubbs, come back to see the owld
place. ’
\\ bate or ! Him come my place an’ takee

Hell to yer so.vi!” snorted the indignant
“Did yez have any monney at all,
at all. See here, now. Yell come straight
back and we’ll see this monney phwat’s bin
stole. Come an, Misther Shtubbs, an’ i’ll
settle this business right now. Shtole all his
monney! Come an, all av yez!”
\Ye got up and proceshed down the street,
where the daylight was gathering very fast.
Constable Patrick mumbled and snorted to
himself, and finally burst out:—
Sorra I am, Mishter Stubbs, to put ye
to such inconveniance. Was that yer cair
on the side av the road, down beyant?”
"Yes, Pat. Petrol gave out; driver drunk.
So we came along to see if we could get
something to eat and drink. I thought Old
Charlie was still at the old pub, and went up
10.I 0 . it x*"’ s h°°k him, and this (pointing to
Ah boo) got up with a sudden yell and
reached for the meat chopper.”
“Howly shmoke; ye don’t tell me!” gasped
. at in awful indignation. “Be gob, but me

Ao, no; Pat. Don’t do it. Unless he’s
coming on the double!”
“I’ll double him, if he tries it, sorr. An’
how ave ye bin doin’V ’Tis a powerful
tonne since ye wuz at the owld place, Mr.
Shtubbs!”
By this time we had reached the foot of
the ladder that led to Ah l/'oo’s sleeping
apartment. Ah Foo led the way, followed
i sta hle Pat and Stubbs. Once inside
the loft Ah Foo lit a candle and dived
under a heap of straw in the corner, where
lie took a piece of board out of the floor and
abstiacted from the cavern below a round
I)"- This he opened, and then turned up-
side down on the gin case beside his bed.
When he removed the tin there was a small
heap of disreputable-looking sovereigns.
“Is that the monney that was shtole, ye
haythen ?” demanded Constable Pat, fiercely.
“Yes, all li! No lockem up. Better you
go way now!” said Ah Foo, serenely.
But Constable Pat was not so easily
mollified. He seized the Chinaman by the
shoulder.
“See here, now. D’ye moind me ! These
gentlemin could have ye nut in fer illegal
arrist, threaten’nin behavior, be gob ; an’ ail
sorts av things, an’ git every sovran ye
have fer damages. D’ye moind me! But
they’re not vindictive. They want grilled

milk, wid rum in it. D’ye understhand me.
Now git it, quick; sudden quick, an’ I'll
not put ye in. D’ye moind me, ye haythen?”
“All li ! Grilled steak, ploached eggs two.

“That’s it—and well out av it ye are.
Can ye git to the dining-room widout wak-
ing fh' owl lydy?”
“Yes, all li! I takem now,” said Ah Foo,
who was beginning to weary of Constable
I ’a t.
He was as good as his word, and 10
minutes later we were enjoying ourselves.
By the time we had eaten and drunken the
boots was abroad, and we got him to take, a
lin of petrol down to the car in a wheel-
barrow ; and brought the whole outfit, in-
cluding the sleep-
ing owner, to the
hotel, where we
ran it under a shed.
Then we went to
have a sleep.
About half-past
nine the boots in-
formed us that
breakfast would be
off at 10 a.m. So
we rose up hastily,
cooled our heads
under the shower,
and went down to
breakfast. Half-
way through we
heard angry voices,
and the boots ex-
claimed :
“That’s where
yer betters eat.
That’s yer place,
in there, the bob
dining room.”
But the “chauf-
feur” was able-
bodied, an d in
jus indignation he
swept the boots
aside and strode
in. lie regarded
us coldly; then he
looked round and
dived for a seat at
the next table.
“This is the half-
crown dining-room

the waitress,
,timidly
Stubbs rose up.
“There’s some
ridiculous mistake.
This gentleman
owns his own car,
and is taking us
round out of
friendship. Why is
he treated in this
disgraceful fashion,
- Mary ?”
Mary blughrd and apologised. We sug-
gested that he should come to our tabic,
which was nearer the window: He hesitated
a moment, and then unfreezing demanded
where the devil we were and how we got
there. When the explanation was over we
started at 30 miles an hour for Myosotis
and Sydney.
Forty minutes later I walked’ into " the
house and found my wife a tear-stained,
sobbing wreck. Her social position was
ruined, destroyed, subverted, she said.
Tyrell had telephoned his wife and she had
arranged bail, and lie had arrived home
about S p.m. full of fury and lust of revenge
for our having had him locked up. The
story had gone right round Myosotis,' and
early as it was the whole place was crying
shame on me; and of course, as my legal,
wedded wife, she had to carry all the bur-
den. And then the flood of tears washed
me right out into the flower garden. I
don’t know what to do about it; but I do
wish we had left Tyrell to be run over or
anything. In fact, I wish the beast had
been run qyer.
C. A. JEFFRIES.


The Strike.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was in tlie bad old days when
factories knew not wages boards, nor
ventilation, nor power machinery.
The factory was old Mcßean's. He made
stock clothing on the third flooring of
Hackman’s Buildings. . The top floor of
Hackman’s was devoted to an india-rubber
industry, and in the basement someone ran
a chemical workshop. This organisation
drenched the neighborhood with loathsome
smells by means of escape pipes which
hooted and “chuffed” energetically all day
long. The rank smells rose to the windows
of Mcßean’s and entered through the
broken panes, imperfectly gagged with rags..
Having arrived there they mingled with the
reek of the moleskin and warred with the
pungent stench of burnt or boiled or fried
india-rubber from the top flat. Altogether,
an ambrosial place was Mcßean’s, on a
sultry day, and it called loudly for the
searchlight of hygiene.
On a Monday morning the hands were
arriving in a desultory manner. They were
piece workers and fixed their own time limit.
Exchanging racy greetings they peeled off
much outer finery and stepped it impudently
in high-heeled, stub-toed boots to their
obsolete work benches and job lot machines.
These latter when in motion rattled like
musketry gone mad. By far the greater
number of “hands” were "moles.” They put
together moleskin trousers, and were a
colony to themselves, despised by their
superiors, the “tweeds,” yet feared by them
also, for > they were powerful by reason of
their numbers.
Collectively they were larrikinesses. They
earned high wages, wore velvet ulsters, top-
heavy and much-befeathered hats, and flash
silver jewellery. Straight-cut fringes hung
to their eyebrows and their back hair was
tied in a switch, or else elegantly plaited
into “basket-knobs,” studded with gilt hair
pins. They were given to ribaldry. They
swore. At times they fought. And in all
weathers they were perfumed with the odor
of moleskin. The tweed machinists seemed
by comparison almost of gentle blood.
These sat, not in serried ranks like
common moles, but chaotically, their
machines drawn for light near the filthy,
unopened windows. The tract of floor
between the tweeds and moles was left to
the apprentices, the button sewers, and the
“button-’ole-’an’s.” Hunched round ancient
wooden benches these miscellaneous toilers
served as a barricade when the ever
smouldering war between the factions
broke out afresh.
Though all were “hands”, the social dis-
tinctions were strictly observed between
them. The “bntton-’ole-’an's,” for no
anparent reason, were on the highest rung.
“Order coats” ran them close. The “order-
vests” and the makers of the very necessary
“order pants,” were, by some social subtlety,
many ranges lower, yet far above the
makers of the stock trousers. A rapid
descent, like the dowmward rush of the
Oadarene swine, then began through the
other branches, stopping dead at the
“tickets.” But even these submerged
banded with their betters in contempt of
the riff-raff “moles.”
It being Mondav the hands were slow at
starting work. The slackness of Sunday
was over them. Saturday night’s “darnce”
at ’Ockins and the ’Anover Rooms were
being criticised, and the moles emerging,
from violet and claret ulsters, gave their
opinions “lip.” They were in the mood to
clamor and annoy, and when a late
“button-’ole-er,” said to be more than
ordinarily stuck up. appeared at the stair-
head she fell right into the jaws of the
moleskin lion. The late comer was genteel.
She was a greedy reader of Bow Beixs, and
modelled her costumes upon those of its
heroines. She wore the tied back skirt of
that period, which was some time ago, and
the long wired “bustle” like an up-ended
bolster behind. Her nose was haughtily
inclined and she was crowned by a
Quakerish bonnet with strings of gauze.
Dressed thus had the persecuted Lady
Ermyntrude returned to her father’s halls
in the last edition of Bow Beixs, and
haughtily rejected the propositions of the
Duke de Mullock. Everything about her
was antagonistic to the moles. Her walk,
her superior air, especially the modest
bonnet of the beaten heroine of fiction.
They bailed her up. “O’ow!” cackled
Molly Mullins, a raucous-voiced vixen.
“O’ow ! ’Ere’s our bloomin’ duchess, ’oldin’
’er ’ead ’igh as usual. ’Ow you poppin’,
duchess?” (This pleasantry was newly
born and was working overtime.) “’Ow’s
the dook? Gout Letter?”
These sallies moved the moles to mirth.
It took but little to do it. their emotions
seeming to lie on the surface. The duchess
quickly found herself surrounded by the
jeering enemy. While affecting ah air of
aloofness, as one about to return to the
family estate for the summer, her heart
thumped her ribs.
She looked at the foreman. No assistance
was offering there. One hard was as good as
another according to the foreman’s theory,
and the best girl had to win. All jowl and
scowl he went on sorting ready-mades.
“Give her a go. mates!” bawled Molly to
her party, planting herself unpleasantly
close to the palpitating aristocrat. “Who’s
ver bloke?” she demanded. “Is yer weddin’
fixed. Show’s yer ring?” But the duchess,
unable to supply any data on the subject,
remained silent. “Arnswer, or I’ll knock
yer bonnet orf!” warned the vixen.
This idea pleased the mob. “Knock it
orf, Moll! Jump on the thing!” they
cried. “A bonnet, no less ! Why carn’t she
wear a ’at, same’s us? Ain’t it good enough?
Too common, p’raps. Tike the thing orf,
duchess, ’fore we help yer.”
The duchess hesitated. One of the moles
very kindly did the job for her, violently,
with a ball of clippings.
At this outrage the tweeds rose in ven-
geance. They swarmed to the centre of the
floor and urged the duchess to “ ’ook it.”
Gladly would she have done so, but the
moles refused their consent. They crowded
round her in an unintelligent and unintelli-
gible mob and seemed about to murder the
bonnet in cold blood. Then another ball of
clippings missed its mark and met the eye
of Miss Mullins instead. Brooking no ex-
planations. she turned and pounced on the
author of the bad shot, Liz Carter, shook
and thumped her. tore buttons from her
bodice and hair from her fringe.
Locked in a fierce embrace, their bustles
swaying and crashing, the wild cats of the
moleskin department clawed and scratched,
getting in some fine tooth and nail work.
Squealing in utter abandon the entire body
of moles entered into action. They climbed
on to the machines, taking sides with the
pugilists ancj throwing big cotton reels, with
deadly indirectness, into the heart of the
fray. Those who could not be in the van-
guard did guerilla warfare, pulling the reel-
throwers down by the ankles. The reel-
throwers smote the floor with terrible thuds
and worse language. These tactics re-
sulted in lesser fights on all sides. The
melee became general. Pressers, arriving

by the goods lift, fringed the serum, and
tilled any gaps in the din with sporting
advice. The air was full of dust and hair,
and resonant with the crash of many wire
bustles.
Old Mcßean waddled upstairs and com-
manded an instant cessation. No one heard
him any more than if he had been the bones
of Job. His vocal chords, long hampered
with fatty accumulations, were useless, and
in any case apoplectic rage had eclipsed his
voice. Bike a drunken humming-top of
great size he rolled forward to stay the riot
in person, but getting a stinging clout from
some revolving bustle lie fell like a ton of
blubber into the moleskin pit. There he
lay, helpless, like an upturned tortoise,_ his
arms and legs pawing the air, till the shindy
was summarily stopped by a lad from the
basement who turned the fire extinguishing
apparatus on the whirlwind. Then some-
one dived and rescued Mcßean.
Brightened and refreshed by the row the
hands got to work in earnest.
The duchess, still whole, sat down to
“tinker” Saturday’s work. All her clique
were doing the same. Buttonholes, which
seemed passing fair at knock-off, with Sat-
urday afternoon and Sunday in view,
seemed now, by the pessimism natural to a
Monday morning, absolute botches. They
aroused panic in the bosoms of their crea-
tors. Much coaxing, biting, pinching
and a liberal use of the bodkin were needed
to redeem them. The duchess regarded her
lot gloomily and gathered a sheaf of un-
biassed 'opinion on their merits. Luck and
chance and such frail gods, she gathered,
were her only hope of getting them passed.
Armed with hope and the goods she
timidly approached the overseer, Kavanagh.
As from an ambush he, having seemed
eoucliant on the counter, suddenly shot out
at great length. The explanation of this
acrobatic feat was simple. He had odd
legs, one long, one short. In locomotion he
was for ever dropping to abysmal depths
and then springing to the heights. Raised
suddenly to his long member, his spiteful
face was level with the disdainful nose of the
duchess. Then with an ape-like curve of his
arm beneath the counter he dragged out two
dozen shoddv vests and lunged them at her.
“Wes-cuts!” he snarled. “Wescuts!
Some of our best diagonals—ruined !”
He let tliis verdict soak into the paralysed
mind of the duchess. Then : “Have you no
intelligence?” he asked, as though inquiring
into some rare species hitherto unknown.
“Are you a sheer idiot?” he demanded
fiercely. “What I want to know is, do you
ruin our stuff through inexperience, or have
you a grudge against the firm? If the lat-
ter, why not lodge the complaint in writing
in the usual way. I assure you it will
fccqjyc puy ijumicdigte attention.”
Suddenly abandoning the frivolous vein,
he threw the vests upon the duchess and
bellowed: .
“Take ’em away ! Unpick ’em ! Dammit,
such work’s a disgrace to Mcßean’s!
Gimme those!” He snatched the tinkered
lot. “I’ll look over these with me glasses
on. Can’t you get away with them damn
diagonals V”
Exhausted with his emotion he sank back
to counter level, and the duchess, quicker
than the nimble goat, fled to the scene of her
labors. There, yielding to the grip of de-
spair, deaf to the condolences of the other
incompetents, she pillowed her head on the
shoddy and blubbered openly.
To the rescue came Miss Gayone, beauty
and buttonhole expert of Mcßean’s, whose
work was as perfect as though done by the
then-unheard-of buttonhole machines. Snip-
ping swiftly she soon ridded the vests of the
cat’s-teeth stitches put in by the duchess.
With incredible speed she reworked a few
holes, giving much advice in. Presently she
left the grief-stricken one considerably bucked
up. A tender heart had Miss Gayone under
her be-buttoned bodice and dangling chains.
Also she had a merry eye for her repulsive
employer, whose habit it was to waddle daily
to her bench and have his ears and eyes
tickled by her wit and beauty.

The duchess was all for strike. In such a

and her dead horse” as the heap of rejected
wes cuts is termed. Yet her ignorance of
the matter was colossal, and most amiably
she left the decision to the clique. The
cliques left it to the mob. Then the thought-
ful ones gathered together and muttered.
-Lhe place was found to be teeming with ora-
nlf at tbeir own eloquence, these
held the floor at length. Towards bell-time
the situation became tense. Accidents such
as the cutting off of a trousers leg by an
apprentice or the spilling of milk on an order
passed without comment.
Miss Eyres, of the “pockets,” who chewed
tacking cotton, and whose unwholesome diet
caused frequent faints, fell to the floor un-
heeded, though on common days such an
event would be legitimate excuse for all
hands to gather round and rob the invalid
ot air. -The strain increased. It grew more
nerve wracking. A trouser hand, laughing
at a trifle, laughed and laughed till, a shriek-
ing bundle of hysterics, she was borne to a
cold-water cure at the tap.
A few minutes before 1 p.m. old Mcßean
was hoisted on to a bale, and from there he
delivered an ultimatum :
“Stay an’ work, or be damned!” he cried
huskily.
But fatty degeneration and the hoots of
the moles drowned his words, and the wob-
bling of the bale robbed him of dignity. It
was just on one o’clock, and the hands were
still undecided. They had never struck, and
were timid of establishing a precedent. Some
resumed their stools. Others hovered in
doubt around them. Mcßean, rehoisted,
made a final appeal with fair promises. A
riotous hand smote him with a pair of half-
made moles.
Kavanagh, more jowl and scowl than
ever, leaped to his highest and yelled,
“Work, you wooden-heads!”
“Bhong! Bhong! Bluing!”
It was the bell. On its cessation none
moved till old Miss Peters, thin and flat as
a cutter’s pattern and stony with resolve,
put on her bat. It needed but the action.
Instantly all were fighting for their ulsters;
cramming on their feathered hats anyhow,
crowding and jostling to the stairs.
Tramping her “dead horse” under foot the
duchess struck with a will. She was one
of the first to reach the stairs. Like Lot’s
wife she looked back, and like that Biblical
lady was almost petrified to see the moles, in
the wildest tumult. Among them something
vast was struggling, now black, now white,
as it turned and was turned like a sea
monster sporting in the waves. The fact
rushed into the con-
sciousness of _ the

Narrow backyards where on the washing line
Flutters the flag of skimping poverty;
Pinched gardens of a smoky, budless vine
Or aphis-stricken rose of misery;
Children who seem spawn of some Outer Hell,
Birth-blighted babes who know the gutter well;
A blear-eyed, slouching tramp in tattered shirt—
Fnpicturesque indeed is Western dirt!
But I shall weave a vantage web of dreams.
Naught shall be here this noon=hour as it seems 1
This street of choked-up drains and full-fed rats
That woke at dawn to milkmen’s clattering cans,
That sagging fence, pathway of prowling cats,

And yonder Nubian slave, a eunuch, dumb,
With the gold chain upon his naked chest—

From glistening ranges to moist coastal lands;

The gleaning from the dusty garbage pan
Is merchandise in some rich caravan.
Great bales of silk to wrap round warm, white limbs;
Some silver anklets, packed with cinnamon;
A veil that, like a mountain’s cloud-top, dims
To keep its beauty undefiled, for one
Who shall be first to lift that veil and press
Upon her lips the conqueror’s caress,
Who fiercely visions through these waiting hours
Narrow backyards, where on the swinging vine
Flutters the flag of scantly-clothed distress,
A cairn of empty tins that gape and shine,
A scolding slattern in a beer-stained dress,
A bloated rat, fresh from some gruesome feast.

The glamor of the East
Sweeps over all. Across a blood-red sun

And ’twixt the curtains of the palanquin
A jewel flaming on a milk white skin!

Fact’ry ’Ands.
NICHOLAS DON’S NEW PROFESSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DON was mystifying the
whole establishment of Odg=on, Odg-
_ son ... and- .Another, manufacturing
stationers, Pickle Lane, City.
“Stiffen me,” said the bright young
packer from the bag flat, “but how’s Don-
nie doin’ it! Here’s him, a lay member iv
the Carters’ Union, not drawin’ a touch
over four jim ev’ry second Friday, ’n’ lo ’n’
behold he’s bouncin’ coin about like the
spendthrift son in a bad drammer.”
Nicholas Don flipped up a little fountain
.of sovereigns, and caught them deftly as
(bey fell, humming a lightsome air the
while. Ilis affectation of obliviousness was
HANDY!
SCARED OLD PARTY (during gale): “ Oh, captain, if the ship should sink, how far is the
nearest land? ”
THE MARINER : "fist below, mum, about ten fathoms .”
intended to deceive no one. About a score
of the male employees were perched on the
lorry at tiie lift door, w T ith papers of lunch
in their aprons. Nicholas was taking no-
thing.
“Fact is, blokes,” he had said, “I’m holdin’
meself in fer a big bag et the Occidental
this evenin’ —seven courses V a pink silk
serviette. Four sun-dried chaff san’wiches
’n’ a brittle bun disfigured with set-off from
the sportin’ columns iv the llekald, such ez
the lan’lady of the Lost Youths’ Home
doses her patrons with, ain’t no meal fer
the moneyed classes.”
“Look et him!” gasped the packer, as
Nicholas Don playfully dribbled his bright
collection of coins from one hand to the
other. “All the new season’s goods, too.
Either he’s discovered the back way into the
secret hoard iv a pop’lar bookmaker, or he’s
bin adopted be a beccentric elderly maiden
lady of means, what lives on’y t’ gratify his
every whim.”
“Have a look et his sumptclius happarel,
too,” said Benno, “ ’n’ his snarklin’ booties,
’n’ his shot socks with spots.”
“Yes,” continued Mills severely. “The lad
what drives an old, brown, wind-galled ’orse
fer Spats and Co., while wearin’ a gold-
spangled lavender shirt, a tie what ud wake
baby, ’n’ a pair of the newest America
bloomers, with two spare rooms aft, lays
himself wide open to suspicion. Speak up,
Niekie, clear yer conscience, me pore man.”
“These,” said Mr. Don, pouring out the
gold again, “is fair dinkum fees fer profes-
sional services, and nothin’ but.”
The assertion provoked a roar of derision,
but Nicholas Don, leaning against the
bricks, drew from lrs left breast a fat cigar
with a gorgeous bellyband, and lit the lux-
urious weed. Crossing his legs, he hooked
his thumbs in the armholes of his vest, and
surveyed his critics complacently through
the smoke. “The rest is silence,” said he.
The warm interest the factory hands and
the superior beings of the clerical depart-
ment were feeling in the firm’s carter be-
cause of this sudden access of wealth might
have been raised to fever heat had Nicholas
chosen to be confiding and explicit.
On the previous Monday night at about
20 to 12 N. Don had left his humble lodg-
ings in a manner at once. mysterious and
suggestive. He lowered himself from the
window with the precarious assistance of a
withered grape vine, and crept with a cat-
like stealthiness out by Mrs. McCormic’s
back gate. Contrary to his custom, he
owed nothing for board, so bis conduct might
have invited remark were there spectators,
but the departing guest invited no audience.
The carter spent an hour walking by quiet
ways to a pretentious suburb on the other
side of the city. Here he selected a desir-
able balcony residence, easy and accessible,
and entered the grounds with the connivance
of a loose paling at the side.
Under cover of a prolific hedge Nicholas
tied a strip of crepe about bis forehead 1o
serve as a ma«k. stole to the ship of the
house, and walked, with a further show of
feline agility, up the creeper-covered lattice-
work. On the balcony he wasted no time
in reflections on his wickedness or recollec-
tions of his good mother, as is customary
with amateur burglars in oolite fiction. He
went straight to work on the windows With
a small iron implement.
Having splintered the sill a little, he threw
up the window —and confronted a tall young
woman in white night attire, who clutched
a medium-sized Colt’s revolver in her right
hand, and faced him with a determined and
dramatic air.
Here was a situation ! Nicholas Don met
it with astonishing coolness. He waited
almost a minute.
“Well?” he whispered, “Blime, why don’t
yeh shoot?"
The woman in white raised her lethal
weapon, but the paleness of her face was
plain even in the poor light of the stars, and
her hand trembled piteously, and her gun
pointed in rapid succession at all the con-
stellations and at the bowels of the earth,
and at sundries. Also, it aimed at Marathon
and Waterloo and Noah’s Ark.
“Here,” snorted Nicholas, “gimme the
blessed dissolver. I’ll do it meself.”
Don snatched the revolver from the
woman’s hand, fired two shots in rapid suc-
cession, and then jumped over the balcony
rail into a convenient pansy bed, and fled
into the night.
The shots and Miss Winnie Simperton’s
screaming brought Madame Laliff’s paying
guests swarming on to the balcony. They
found Miss Winnie Simperton, pale but de-
termined, with the smoking revolver in. her
hand. They found the burglar’s mask and
jemmy. They found the burglar’s black
boxer hat with a bullet puncture in the roof.
They found the burglar’s tracks in the pansy
bed. But they did not find Nicholas Don,
who was already across the river journeying
towards Mrs. McCormic’s comfortable home
for single men at 28 Pipe-street, Port.
The driver of Odgson’s delivery van had
tastes superior to his station and no appre-
ciation of thrift. Within a month the-glory
of his sonorous American suit had departed
with the sheen from his patent leathers, and
once more he was compelled to adapt the
exnenditure of a fast young man about town,
with the two-up habit and a congenital beer
thirst, to the frugal ideas Odgson enter-
tained on pay day.
The driver’s normal impecuniosity lasted
perhaps another month. Then suddenly he
was flush again, and juggling sprays of gold
coin before envious eyes in Pepper Lane.
And again sagacious Feathers, from the bag
flat, commented on the astonishing spectacle
in his own way.
“Mickie,” pleaded the packer, “if yeh
know a crack in a bank be a sport. Open
yer ’eart to us. If yer tart’s ’ead saleswoman
in the Mint, remember the poor. None iv
us is ’arborin’ any unreasonin’ prejudice
agin tainted money. The worst of it’ll
wash. Jimmy Gee ! where’s the use iv our
havin’ a financial hexpert on the staff if we
don’t never get a scoop. In the name iv
our common ’umanity, Donnie, don’t be a
hog!”
The Don chinked both pockets. “Well,”
he mused, “I was jist goin’ t’ bint that if
any of yell’s bin denied the week’s washin’
fer the sake iv a paltry fiver, I”
He was borne down in the rush, and then
to placate the clamorous baud he led 18 of
them to the corner bar for refreshment.
That shout established a Pepper Lane re-
cord.
At half-past five p.m., on a recent date.
Nicholas Don. prowling in an unfrequented
part of a public nark, had snatched a bag
from the hands of a defenceless lady, and
made off. leaving his tie and one sleeve link
in the hands of his interesting victim. In
tlie papers of the following morning it was
represented that the bag contained jewels
to the value of £BOO. The detectives had
viewed the evidences of a struggle, they held
the sleeve link, the tie and a finger print
from the lady’s bangle, and the capture of
the criminal was supposed to be imminent.
Nicholas, reading all this, was not per-
turbed. "the tie was a kind he never wore.
The sleeve link was one he had found, and
the finger print was that of the lady’s lady’s-
maid. The stolen bag was rather a shabby
one, and it contained three strings of glass
beads, worth quite 9d. ; but this fact also
failed to distress the thief. It did not even
surprise him. '
There was an interval of 12 weeks before
Nicholas Don’s next adventure came about.
He was seeking rest and change at a seaside
resort during his New Year when
he became the hero of a most romantic in-
cident. The papers explained that Nicholas
Don, a young man, respectably dressed, em-
ployed as a carter by Messrs. Odgson, Odg-
son and Another, had been rescued from
death by drowning in circumstances of un-
usual interest. .
Nickie’s rescuer was Miss Florrie Dor-
rington, and in a spirited description of the
event this charming creature was repre-
sented as a heroine of great courage, ex-
traordinary endurance, and almost celestial
beauty. She had succeeded in dragging the
unfortunate youth to land after a desperate
struggle. Then exhausted nature gave out,
and the gallant little woman fainted away.
Don had been restored to conscience only
after a gang of amateurs had applied every
known rule for the resuscitation of the half-
drowned.
The carter came wearily un to the bag
flat on the morning of the third day follow-
ing these stirring events. His manner was
languid, and he tried to Dole pale and in-
teresting. Three-and-thirty hoydens greeted
Nicholas with a jubilant whoop, and rushed
him with clamorous queries
Nicholas told the tale again, with affect-
ing details. He had peeped through the
gates of hell. A beautiful, brave compas-
sionate woman had saved him, and he could
never again be the coarse, careless, godless
man he once was. Benno, the clerk, sprawl-
ing on his desk, viewed the scene with bilious
envy. It was long since he had been able
to figure as a hero of romance. Feathers
worked quietly at his bench, but the expres-
sion in his eye was such that when Nicholas
caught it it chilled his soul, and his glowing
narrative dribbled into puerility.
The girls returned to their work, and Mr.
Don lounged on the packer’s board. His
air was one of diffidence. There was con-
scious guilt all over and about him.
“Nickie,” said Feathers presently in a
soft, low tone, “yeh might give it me all over
agin—me, the friend iv yer youth.”
“Give yeh what?”
“Why, that heart-renderin’ little 'Ans
Andersen with the ragin’ elements ’n’ the
pure, beautiful ladies in it, ’n’ the gurgles
’n’ dyih’ moments. Hold me hand, Nickie,
’n’ tell me it all over agin, just ’tween our
two selves, ’n’ I’ll cry on your neck, ’n’ you
can cry on mine.”
“Mills, yer makin’ me leg ache,” said
Nicholas.
“ ’N’ afterwards,” the packer continued,
“yeh might explain how it comes that our
Nickie, who can swim like a bull crocodile
after a cat, had to be dragged _ frim the
stormy billers by a small dame with a sad.
sweet smile ’n’ a waterproof complexion. All
iv these things not necessarily fer publica-
tion —I don’t think.”
“If yeh don’t like it how it is,” growled
Don, “you can stand it off. I ain’t pushin’
the goods on no one.”
“Not at all,” mused the packer. “But
there’s the dooty I owe the public. So I
gotter little letter written, askin’ the editor
iv the ’Erald how can these. things be, ’n’
sorter mentionin’ ez a side issue that the
said Nicholas Don cud swim a mile with
4cwt. iv pig-iron in his teeth.”
“Ga-art, Feathers, don’t be a Noah s
Ark!” Nicholas was showing some trepida-
tion.
“A nark —me?” ejaculated Mills, virtu-
ously. “Never. But a man has a natural
cravin’ fer facts. It ’mounts to a mania
with G. Mills.”
“Ah-h. shut it!” said Nicholas weanlv.
“Lunch up here on yer lonesome, ’n’ I’ll
chance round, V give yeh the strength iv
it.”
“Good e-nough. In them circs, there 11
be no public comment frim the said G.
Mills.”
Feathers and Nickie lunched together m
the left corner, behind a stack of brown
royal. With a bottle of beer in his right,
and a cold steak sandwich rather smaller
than a suit case in his left, Mr. Don made
his revelation.
“ ’T seems.” said he, “I was strollin’ that
pier as per arrangement, when I sorter side-
steps inter the sea by accident —also as per.
Then the beautiful V fascinatin’ Miss
Florrie Dorrington, who was reading on a
seat hard by. as decided on early in the
proceedin’s, gives a wild cry, rushes to the
side, ’n’ plunges in t’ save a feller creature’s

sands I’m dead t’ the world for a space iv

but me nibs obstinately refuses t’ come round
till the press arrives. There you are, that s
all there is to it.” , ,
“But why,” gasped the packer. Why n
wherefor?” . , .. .
Nicholas regarded him from round the neck
of the bottle with fearful contempt.
“Garrt!” he said, “ain’t the lovely Miss
Florrie Dorrington an actress?”
“Nickie. kick me!” wailed the packer.
“I’m gettin’ dilly in me old age. It’s all
jist a little flash advt. for Florrie.”
“That’s what.” replied Don. See here,
I’m thinkin’ iv havin’ a few ’undred iv them
printed.”
He handed Mills a neat white card, on
which was written -

“Then this accounts fer yer cornin’ into

“ ’Twas Miss Winnie Simperton turned

“Skews me,” retorted Nicholas Don, “the

EDWARD DYSON.
God’s Garden.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Lord had a goodly forest, and
huge and high were Ilis trees.
Lifting a network of branches to toss
their leaves in the breeze;
But under them dwelt the saplings, a foolish
and lanky folk ;
So the Lord decreed that the forest be
utterly strown and broke.
He sent men in to destroy it with axes, and
saws, and fire,
And wedges, and forest-devils, to bring its
pride to the mire;
And teams of lumbering bullocks which
worked for the whips of men;
Till the forest was razed and ruined, and the
plain was unclothed again.
Then the Lord looked down from Ilis
Heaven, which is somewhere up in (he
air,
He saw that His will was accomplished, and
the place was now utterly bare;
Appeased was His righteous anger, for the
trees in their pride were slain ;
So He set the men to the ploughshare to till
and culture the plain.
Plough and harrow lie gave them, and
roller, and spade, and drill;
And they broke the sods of the furrows, and
handled the earth with skill,
Till soon it was green with herbage—barley,
and oats, and wheat;
And the smell of the harvest pleased Him,
and the clovers were rich and sweet.
But soon He wearied of harvests —the
flaunting of high-plumed maize;
The lazy gold of the wheatfield that idled
the summer days ;
The oat-stack, and the hay-rick, that fat-
tened the foolish kine ;
And tuber roots of the flat lands that
cozened the greedy swine.
So the Lord looked down in an anger, and
the season’s rains withheld ;
And out of the ancient spring-beds the
streams no longer welled ;
The growth ceased, and the buds fell, and
the grasses were turned to dust;
The crops failed, and the sheep died, and the
earth was a sun-baked crust.
The Lord in Ilis wrath was righteous, as
ever a God must be;
He had stricken the prideful forest to the
roots of its final tree ;
When the plain had blossomed with har-
vests, and yielded His creatures, food,
He had burned it up to appease Ilim —and
who shall question His mood?
Thenceforth He made it an orchard, and
plenished the streams once more;
lie set new men to the planting, to labor by
hill and shore;
And they planted the vine and medlar, the
aople, and peach, and pear,
Till the land was a flourishing garden, with
never an acre bare.
Oh, gay were the plum and cherry, their
petals were strewn like snow;
The orange groves were a scented maze, and
the apricots a-glow;
But the Lord, grown vexed as they pros-
pered, and deeming their beauties vain.
Devised a means of destroying the fruittui
folk of the plain.
He sent them a murrain of aphis, and
beetles to bore the root, ,
And moths to lurk in the fruit-bud, and scale
to disease the fruit; ,
Until they were wilted and withered, and
rotted, and blighted sore;
And men cleaned their ruin with fire ana
the desert was bare once more.
Now, the Lord in Ilis righteous anger sur-
passes all earthly kings;
And who shall question His wisdom, tna
doeth these mivlity things !
Shall He make? And shall He destiny not
whatever He choose to make. .
Wherefore I have written this song ot prais< •
and sung it unto His sake .

A Snatched Brand.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
-rnll E KID,” as he was familiarly
I known, stood at the corner of the
street, at a comfortable leaning
nn°le against a verandah post, thinking. He
had recently got two things—religion and
work. At least, he was supposed to have
got the former; the second there was no
doubt about. It was characteristic that he
was apathetic about the one, and that the
other annoyed and distressed him.
He had been caught on the rebound, so
p, speak. It was one unlucky night, when
he had been turned out of a “two-up” school,
bruised and penniless. The boss of the place
was an autocrat, and, because the Kid had
refused —as he had before—to hand over a
stiff percentage of his winnings, he had
been roughly handled and passed out. into
the street. And when he was 'out in the
street he found he was also out £l4.
When he made this discovery he became
filled with a great bitterness against Big
Sam, the man who ran the “school,” and
against those who had helped in the spolia-
tion. He had a fairly good command of
language, as he knew it, but there are times
when mere words only irritate by their in-
adequacy, and this was one of the times.
So he relapsed into a sullen, speechlesss
brooding on revenge.
It was while he was in this mood that the
missionary got him. Almost before the
Kid was aware, he was in, a well-lighted
hall, and the missionary was saying things
about him; calling him “a dear brother
saved,” and “a brand snatched from the
burning”; and the people in the hall were
crying “Amen” and “Glory” with great
fervor.
The Kid didn’t like it. There was too
much public notice about it. But presently
there came to him an idea that it might be
a good thing to carry on for a few days,
because it would make Big Sam worry as
to wiietiler, now tliut he had reformed, he
would "blow the gaff,” and put the police on
to his little game. Also, it would give him
time to think out a plan of liis own, and
so get square.
lieforming was hard work, though. He
had to go a long way to a strange pub for
his beer. Worse than that, the missionary,
who always tried to finish up any job he
took in hand, found him work in a store.
And now he stood, at the end of his first
week’s work, leaning against a verandah
post, looking into the future. And the
future, as he saw it at the moment, was
lull ot work. He spat disgustedly into the
roadway.
1 f°r me,” he said, unconsciously
speaking aloud. “I’ll take damn good care
they don’t get me doing that.”
He turned swiftly as. a hand fell on his
shoulder and the voice of the missionary
tell on his .ears.
“I don’t like the language, but I do like
the resolution,” said the good man. “And
f am glad to find you are so strong-minded,
fell me, were you resisting temptation just
now?” '
The Kid nodded.
“Making up your mind not to be led into
doing something?”
“That’s right. I —I—was making up my
mind.
“My boy,” said the missionary, “you have
a hard battle. But every time you win
makes the next victory easier. You’ll be
glad of what you have resolved upon to-day;
you are glad now, aren’t you?”
“You bet,” said the . Kid.
And I will help you all I can,” said the
other. “And I can best do that by getting
you to help me. I want to make you a
worker.”
Tim Kid shuddered at the word.
. One of our workers for tlm cause,” the
missionary. went on. “You know that ‘Ye
tide English Fayre’ we have been holding
to provide Christmas gifts for the . poor is
hrawing to a close. We want to make the
|ast nights especially attractive. So we are
introducing fancy characters —a publican, a

ft will be a sort of brief farce. Mr. Smith

f want you to be the policeman, You have

i; Pd so it came about , that, much against
t , s inclination, the Kid spent each night of
ne following week parading the one village
‘ „. e „ e * of “Ye Olde English Fayre” clad in a
nitorm he had never had any love for. But
e looked well, and was many times com-
Panted. One smirking young helper,
vii7 re ■ n , w hat was accepted as the correct
tii ma id eu costume, gushingly told him’
( , a ; he “looked so like a real policeman

Kiglit. Now, then,” addressing the
cowering doorkeeper. “You can write? Of
course you can. Here, take my pocket-
book, and put down (lie name and address
of each of ’ these gentlemen, and also put
down what money he has on him. Now,
you chaps, walk up one by one, and shell
out. It’ll save time at the lock-up. One
at a time, now, and quick, too. You with
the horsey suit on —You first.”
“What about me?” asked Big Sam.
“You’ll be attended to all right, don't you
fear,” replied the policeman, softly stroking
Ins glossy, black beard. “Seeing that you
have the most money, you can save time by
counting it out now. And count it care-
fully ; we don’t want to make any mistake,
you know. And you other chaps, hurry up,”
he added. “The Sergeant and the other
men will be upstairs in a minute.”
One or two of them assumed a devil-may-
care air as they handed over their cash.
The others looked very sheepish. They were
only six or seven all told, and there seemed
to be a shot in the revolver for each.
“Ain’t there no way of slipping out, now
that you’ve got the stuff?” one of them
asked.
Big Sam paused in the counting of his
money and looked up quickly.
“No hope,” said the policeman.
“Look here,” said Sam, stepping forward,
“do a bit of quick thinking. All these here
gents, have got positions they can’t afford to
lose, see? If they has to appear in a police
court, they’re done. See? Now, I should
say there’s nearly a hundred quid here, alto-
gether. S’posing we slins out quick, leav-
ing this on the table. You goes downstairs
and tells ’em the place is empty. How is
it? Quick, now.”
The policeman’s eyes glistened, and Sam
saw the gleam. But the policeman still
kept his gun on Sam and the company.
“ I low is it? Is it a go?”
“We’re going, anywnv,” cried one of the
others.
‘Won can't do a getawav.” said the
policeman. “I tell you the place is sur-
rounded.”
‘‘W e °an. right enough,” said Sam.
‘ Downstairs, through the cellar of the next
house, across the 'back yard and into the
lane. I rents both, these houses on purpose.
Besides,” he went on, “that white-livered
cur that let you get in has gone already.
He s sneaked out while you have been talk-
ing.”
The policeman looked quickly round the
room. The little doorkeeper had disap-
peared.
the stuff on the table, then, and
cut out,” he cried, after a moment’s hesita-
tion. “All of it, mind ; no tricks. And if
any of you ever try to put me away over
this, I’ll snare you for something sad and
savage. All of you empty out; and you.”
pointing his revolver at Sam, “leave the
bank behind you.”
The next moment the policeman was alone
in the room, gathering into a heap the
money which had been hastily thrown on
the table. The sound of a stbp on the stair
reached him, and he turned quickly. The
little doorkeeper entered, carrying a bundle.
* * * *
Sunday was a day of mourning and agony of
mind for Big Sam; but the night brought
added horror and anguish he had not antici-
pated. He sneaked in about 10 o’clock and
made his way to the scene of his ruin. In
the darkness he felt his way to the two win-
dows, to make sure they were still barri-
caded. Then he struck a match and lit the
gas.
Something on the table, which was not
there the night before when he. had thrown
down his money and scuttled out, attracted
his attention. It was a police uniform-
trousers, jumper and cap. In the centre of
the table, with a big revolver resting on if
to prevent its being blown away, was a
sheet torn from a pocket-book. Snatching
it up. he read the following, hastily written
in pencil :• —
“This is from the Kid to let you
know that I got even with you for
bouncing me out of my money. The uni-
form is what I wore round at the mission
sale of work. You send it back, or
you’ll get pinched for nicking it. I
swore to get even with you and I did,
and enjoyed it. My address is America,
and if ever I meet you over there I’ll
break your neck as easy as ,1 broke
your bank. And don’t go looking for
Jerry—he’s got a knife. He ain’t like
me, a brand snatched from the burn-
ing ; he’s vicious. I’d love to hear you
cuss about this, but I’m in too much of
a hurry to stop. Jerry joins with me in
best love.”

Ten boys sat in a ring and played
At telling lies—
An Outback pastime—with a strayed
Young dog for prize.
The Parson they informed, who strolled
To see their fun,
“The pup was for the cove who told
The biggest one.”
The good man looked upon that ring
Of boys and sighed.
“I’m sorry to hear such a thing
As this,” he cried.
N.S.W.
I never dared to tell a lie,
Nor ever knew
Such sinful sport, my lads, when I
Was young like you.”
Ten faces fell, hut not from shame,
But sheer defeat;
Ten little liars dropped the game,
For they were beat;
Ten boys arose—a sullen band—
Quite broken up;
And Jim, the judge, said: “Billy, hand
The bloke the pup.”

The Saviours.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
These institutions and penalties are necessary for
the maintenance of Society.
—Recent judicial utterance.
I SAW Society go down —
The Sea went rushing o’er her ;
A sack of sins her shoulders bore
And Sheol gaped before her ;
And on the sand
There screamed a band
Who bade the public lend a hand—
The sinner and the sainted —-
To save the beldame painted.
And one there came who heaved a whip
(She very nearly caught it) ;
Another threw a gallows rope
(I wondered where he’d bought it.)
And one—a senseless legal pig,
Cast in a judge’s horse-hair wig ;
One danced a Corybantie jig
And then with fingers nimble,
Threw in an Army cymbal.
She grabbed at whip, at wig, at rope;
She clutched whate’er they gave her,—
A Bible and a bishop’s staff
They naught availed to save her;
The load she bore within her sack
She could not shake from off her back,
And ne’er a Jill and ne’er a Jack
For any gold or guerdon
Could rid her of her burden.
And when the stormy day was done
She lay there, cold and painted,
Upon the beach within our reach
A noisome thing and tainted ;
The rope was coiled around her hip,
About her neck was curled the whip,
The wig and staff had slipped her grip;
Yet there they lay around her.
And yet—The Sea had drowned her!
And so we lost Society
Who used to flash in scarlet,
And with her brav’ry make the world
Forget her name was Harlot;
And still she bore —Oh, strange to see—
The sack of old Iniquity,
The while with fierce, unholy glee,
Old Ocean followed after
And shook the shore with laughter.

and a typical sheep camp in a
I narrow-necked bend of the river.
Inside the capacious camp the well-
filled sheep lie contentedly—that is, saving
one big, gaunt wether (the “nark” of the
mob) that stands pensively eyeing the
tethered dog. The dog effectually fills the
gap between the wheel of the cook’s cart
and the water’s edge below the steeply-
sloping bank. The sheep is determined to
get past if lie can. The dog is determined
that he will get the time of his life if he
tries it. So the tw T o form, unconsciously, a
very effective tableau—the wether, with out-
propped legs and lowered head watching the
dog with yellow, unblinking eyes: and the
dog, prone noon the ground, his muzzle
’•"sting between his black fore-paws, watch-

ing embrace, Lord

and flinging himself

enemy, amid Myra's

ing the wether with eyes just as yellow and
unblinking. From the cook’s cart right
across the neck of the bend to the river are
stretched a varied assortment of articles
designed to act as a barrier or “break,” and
made up of tied dogs, sheep-skins, bushes,
ropes with rags fluttering thereon, and
swags. It is to be a “night in.”
Around the fire, seated on up-ended kero-
sene-tin buckets and logs and sundries, the
four drovers and the cook swap yarns and
swear with great capacity at the mosquitoes
that, attracted by the fire, come up in their
myriads from the lagoons. From a gum
bough overhead a ireshiy-killed mutton
swings pallid in the its gory neck but
a few inches above the head of the boss
drover, lie squats gracefully on the “wash-
up” bucket, and his hat shows a gradually
increasing pattern in scarlet as the carcase
above yields its few remaining drops of
gore. The night is cloudy and moonless,
and beyond the arc of light thrown by the
fire the gloom lies as thick as the ignorance
of the Dark Ages.
“Black as a dingo’s soul,” remarks the
cook, removing his pipe and staring over his
shoulder in the direction of the river.
“Ghos’ly sort uv a night.”
“That reminds me uv a yarn I once
heard a feller rell uv a ghost and a river
and a dark night,” said Bob, the boss drover.
“There was a haunted ’ouse in it, too.”
Bill Craike’s big, simple blue eyes opened
to their fullest extent as the uncanny de-
scription smote his hearing. “A haunted
’ouse in the river?” he queried.
“No, y’ chump. In th’ yarn.”
The cook shifted a bucket containing the
morrow’s supply of soup from the fire,
placed it out of the way behind Bill, and
returned to his seat.
“Go on, Bob,” he said.
Bob scratched his head with the end of
his pipe, and gazed ponderingly into the
fire. “I dunno ’s I can remember it all as
th’ feller told it to me,” he replied, uncer-
tainly. “I ain’t thought much about it
since.”
“Never mind,” scoffed Hartwell. “Give
’er a try. Y’ can’t make a bigger botch uv
it than y’ generally do, any’ow.”
Thus adjured, Bob, with an indignant
look in the direction of his outspoken sub-
ordinate, removed his pipe, spat with the
easy precision of long practice on a beetle
that was hurriedly exploring the burning
log for a means of escape, and commenced.
“The cove,” he said, with firm but simple
diction, “was Runabout Ryan. They
called him Rupabout because he was the
most restlessest bloke ever y’ see. He’d no
sooner find himself in one place than he’d
reckon it was too quiet, and he’d up and go
somewhere else; an’ when he got there, he’d
mooch around till he got on everyone’s
nerves, growlin’ because it was too slow, an’
he wouldn’t sit still for a minute. Fellers
what knew Ryan wouldn’t go on a mob
with him, because he was always harryin’
’em along to tli’ next camp, and they
wouldn’t be there long enough to get their
breath again before he’d be wantin’ to move
on again, and they couldn’t get no rest.
They used to say that he’d wake up four
or five times durin’ th’ night and move his
blankets to a fresh spot, because he was
tired of sleepin’ any longer in the old one,
and”
“I used t’ know a bloke like that,” broke
in Bill’s soft drawl. “He had two wives,
they say. an’ over 20 kids”
“Oh. shut up.” Hartwell’s raucous voice
slew Bill’s reminiscence in its infancy. “Y’
can recite the census another time. Go
on Bob.” The rejected Bill looked reproach-
fully at his interrupter, and lighting his
nine lie absent-mindedly threw the match
behind him. It fell into the soup tin.
“Don’t be throwin’ yer matches inter th’
soup.” snarled the cook. “Remember
people’s got to eat that there soup.”
Bill, muttering apologies, hooked the
match out, and Bob resumed his interrupted
narrative.
“Ryan hadn’t any wife. He never stayed
long enough in one place to get one. But
he was taking a mob along a fresh route
once, and one evening they touched the
river where there was a great big empty
’ouse with fine yards, all full of grass, and
a splendid waterin’ place with a hard, gravel
bottom and no chance of any boggin’, and
not a soul to turn ’em off within 20 miles.
So he turns the mob into th’ yards and
camps, although the cook, who’d been along
that way before, told him th’ place was
supposed to be ’aunted, tli’ owner havin’
been murdered be liis housekeeper an’ done
away with so that he was never found, and
th’ woman got off, and no o_ne wouldn’t
stay in th’ house under no consideration.
But Ryan just laughed and said he wasn’t
going to move out of a camp like that for
no ghost what ever bre.athed, and ’e’d take
a look round after dark and see if he
couldn’t drop across th’ old remains an’
have a pitch to ’im.”
Bill, deeply interested, glanced casually
about him for something to knock the ashes

from his pipe against. The edge of the soup
tin struck his absorbed mind as being a
suitable object, and before the cook could
interfere a generous allowance of ash added
its fragrance to that of the edible.
“Spare me days!” shouted the outraged
food artist in consuming indignation, rush-
ing to the tin ,and fishing for the unwel-
come ingredient with a pannikin. “’Ave a
bit of common. Th’ man would be sick
for a week what swallered that.”
The culprit uttered fresh sounds of self-
excuse and repentance, and cook, having
salvaged the foreign substances, returned
partially mollified to his seat.
“Sure enough,” went on Bob, “Ryan
hadn’t hardly swallered ’is scran before he
got restless and goes pokin’ about th’ place
like a pea-struck ferret. He stumbled
through th’ yards to th’ house, and by this
time it was gettin’ very dark, and th’ river
was goin’ by with a queer, cryin’ kind of a
noise, and it was as black as a wolf’s mouth
and gettin’ blacker. Ryan goes up to a
door and gives it a bit of a shove and pokes
his ’ead in; and straight-away something
domes flyin’ down on ’is ’ead and knocks ’is
’at off and fair bobby-dazzles ’im for more’n
a minute.”
The audience started visibly. “What was
it?” queried Hartwell.
“A big bit o’ wood what’d been nailed over
the top of the door, and the nails ’ad come
loose, and when Ryan opened the door it
fell on ’im,” explained the unimaginative
Bob, throwing away a splendid chance for
artistic enlargement. The cook, having been
betrayed into an exhibition of nervousness,
grunted unapprovingly as Bob continued.
“When he see what it was what ’d
knocked his ’at off he pushed the door right
open and went in. There was a big, wide
hall, all covered with paintings on the plas-
ter of beautiful women, and blokes on
horseback goin’ like blazes, and mountains
an’ rivers like a picture gallery. He struck
a match and follered the hall along, and he
sees a door fly open and shut again with a
bang, and something blew his match out an’
next second he was lyin’ on his back in the
dust with his foot ’eld that tight ’e couldn’t
’ardl.v breathe.”
“Good Gawd !” The audience objurgated
simultaneously, and eyed Bob with breath-
less apprehension. That unemotional in-
dividual accurately bowled a second beetle
into the fire and went on.
“It shook th’ nerve outer Runabout for a
minute, but after a while, nothing happenin’,
he lit another match and found that his
foot had got caught in a hole in the floor,
and he got up and found the. door openin’
again, and he see that the wind was doin’
it, and it was that what blew the match
out.”
“Well, if that ain’t the rottenest ghost
yarn ever a man listened to,” exclaimed
Hartwell disgustedly. “Y’ make a man
think there’s a ghost, and it turns out to be
a bit of wood, or a gale or a hole or some-
thing. Where’s th’ ghost in this yarn o’
yourn?”
“I’m cornin’ to that, if you’ll give me
time.” expostulated the indignant narrator.
“You leave him be, Hartwell,” drawled
Bill. He stretched himself for greater ease
and carelessly tossed aside his hat. It fell
into the soup, and the shrieks of the cook
tore the heavens asunder.
“Well, why don’t yer keep yfer blasted
soup outer me way?” cried Bill, in tremen-
dous exasperation. The cook, with a new
burst of objurgation, salved the hat and
threw it anywhere. It landed in the fire,
killing another beetle. Bill rushed into the
fire and recovered it amid a cataract of
sparks, some of which fell on Hartwell and
made him angry. “I b’lieve yer put the
food there on purpose,” snarled Bill.
“Y’ believe,” shouted the cook, stammer-
ing in his justifiable wrath. “Y’ believe: /
believe y’ a dam idiot. Y’ tryin’ to turn
people against eatin’ th’ soup.”
A fresh burst of wordy distraction en-
sued, during which the wandering wether
managed to move, unnoticed by the dog. a
few feet more towards its coveted goal. But
the fuss gradually died out, the dog dropped
again to the old position of vigilance anH

“What was it?” asked Hartwell in a
hoarse whisper, half rising from his seat in
his eagerness.
“Seems he’d got himself all twisted up in
some long curtains that hung—eh?”
“Oh, nothin’,” replied Hartwell, wearily
dropping into his seat again. “Missed it
agaiii that dip—that’s all. Go on.”
“So he goes outer that room and pokes

one speak. Just like a wail it was, low
and threatenin’, and lie lit ’is last match
to see if anyone was in the room instead of
’im bein’ alone by ’imself.”
“’E must’ve ’ad a terrible nerve,” struck
in Bill’s awed whisper.
“Took a lot to frighten Runabout,”
averred Bob. “’E looked about the garret
without seein’ anyone, and had just got
back to below the winder when out goes th’
match —’is last match —and cornin’ straight

(Bob’s voice dropped an octave and took
on a level, uncanny tone that deeply thrilled
his audience), “and bein’ fair rattled he ’ung

horror of its ending, mingling with the
weird gurgling of the river as it slid blackly

affected the nerves of his listeners that they

it was introduced into this country ten years ago
mostly spelt slightly differently —but none
are based on such a sound formula.
LAXATINE is made from the prescription of an

prescribed by the faculty in all climates.
It is not a purgative, but a tonic laxative. It is
the teeny tiny tonic tablet which brightens the whole
system without being a nerve jag. The dainty lady
finds it equally as pleasant and effective as the
tired athlete.

Noah’s Reputation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE day that Noah put out to sea,
I unto his lianpy familee
JL He cracked a joke : “This is,” said he,
“One way to float a companee!”
For Noah was a funny man,
A self-confessed comed-i-an:
“My gags, since gagging I began,
I arkmologically plan!”
At such-like quips—he’d got a hoard —-
Both quadrupeds and bipeds roared ;
Though Ham would say, whene’er Dad
scored,
“He’s brought a cliestnut-tree aboard.”
All through the floodtime in the Ark,
Old Noah jested after dark
Around the fire. As he’d remark:
“Such lucky dogs to have a barque!”
So when the waters settled down,
And Noah got safe back to town,
His reputation as a clown
Was well established. His renown
Grew with the years, and ev’ry gag,
Heard on the stave to-day (most agg-
ravating to the mime who’ll brag
It’s new) was cracked by Noah —the wag!
VICTORIA.
EARDLEY TURNER.
A Strong Man’s Passion.
[FOR THE NULLETIN.]
Poet and the Art Student were
preparing the Poet’s chamber for the
reception of the ladies. The Poet’s
chamber clearly needed something of that
sort happening to it. At present it was
hardly fit to harbor even a poet.
It contained a bed —a noxious sort of
thing that secreted burnt umber-colored
blankets beneath the remains of a cheap
table-cover with ball fringe. It contained
a table inexpertly made from packing-case
boards. It contained a boot box, a candle
box, a kerosene case and an indestructible
kitchen chair.
It contained a cane lounge that had
come entirely undone, a thing that creaked
and groaned with decrepitude and age, a
sort of vegetable derelict trailing tendrils of
cane as though it had taken root in that
confined atmosphere and w r as commencing to
sprout. It contained some lumber in the
shape of books and papers, and one small
doormat in the centre of the floor —a feeble
oasis in a desert of board.
A well-regulated mind would have stag-
gered at the effrontery of presenting such
an apartment to the gaze of ladies, but the
Poet and the Art Student were oppressed
by no such weak misgivings. Long usage
had made them impervious to the social
stigma of packing-case furniture and burnt
umber blankets. It is for slaves to court a
cheap approval for the value of their pos-
sessions. The Poet and the Art Student
were of that emancipated aristocracy that
has exchanged the importance of owning
valuable property for the finer vanity of
owning rare and valuable souls.
So with the conscious satisfaction of a
man who is doing an • obviously sensible
thing, the Art Student was sweeping all the
rubbish in the room under the Poet’s bed.
It would need, one would think, a subtle
discrimination to distinguish what was
rubbish in that room, and what was not.
But the Art Student seemed to have some
hazy notion of what the social situation
demanded, and the thing that went under
the bed was a mighty heap of old socks, old
boots, old shirts, old rags, old bottles, old
cigarette ends, and old sundries.
In the tremendous cloud of dust raised
by his exertions the Poet, a fat youth in a
long-tailed coat, was energetically tacking
up photos and hits of art muslin. The
photos were of charming women, charming
actresses and various celebrities. One and
ajl bore inscriptions of a personal and
affectionate nature, dedicated in admiration
and respect to the Poet himself.
Those inscriptions attending the present-
ment of charming ladies betrayed but too
clearly the indiscretion of passion’s brief
hour.
Dearest.
In memory of many sad, sweet hours.
Felice.
To kiss when I am gone
Julia.
Do not forget to-day.
Olivette.
Others hinted at a more cosmopolitan appre-
ciation :
To a very charming poet.
Nance O’Neill.
From an admirer.
Cora Brown Potter.
With thanks for a graceful tribute.
Nellie Stewart.
Others were briefer, reflecting a more ster-
ling admiration and regard :
To that talented writer, Edward Batters.
Alfred Deaiux.
From one who has long admired his works.
V. J. Dalev.
Yours ever.
llopetoun.
There was even more than a hint of a
distinguished ancestry in an ancient steel-
engraved portrait of a gentleman in the
costume of the late Georges which bore this
imposing title written upon it: “Sir Isaac
Batters.”
A confession must be made here, a con-
fession deferential to the Poet’s ingenuity,
if not to his integrity. The truth is that
Edward Batters had written the inscrip-
tions himself. It was not heraldry, but
vainglory, that attached Sir Isaac to the
genealogical tree of Batters. He had been
torn by stealth from a second-hand book of
memories because he bore a fancied resem-
blance to the Poet himself. The small beer
of his love affairs did not effervesce in such
a sparkling manner as those souvenirs from
gracious ladies.
Nor was the world of Art and Literature
agitated on the subject of the Poet’s works,
lie made what a bottle-oh merchant would
disdain to call a living by writing occasional
columns for a sporting paper. Such poems,
the children of his inspiration, that luj sent
to other papers were recorded with jeer and
insult in the correspondence column. It is a
brave heart that rejoices in the profession of
poet on such terms. One of-Edward Batters’
finest efforts had been received in these
words: “When your poem was opened it
escaped and ran down a rat hole.”
But what minor bard was ever abashed
by insult. He is not even abashed at being
a minor bard.
When such details of the Poet’s apparel
as a large-brimmed hat, a flowing tie, a
long-tailed coat and an elephantine size in
trousers have been recorded he may be con-
sidered as sufficiently described.
As for the Art Student, he was a pale,
lank youth with too much hair —not dashed
finely back in the manner of a Labor Mem-
ber, but hanging from his cranium in a sort
of dank fringe. lie wore a very large tie,
too, to distinguish himself from common hu-
manity.
It was he who was responsible for the
proposed introduction of the ladies. Being
THE BUSINESS HEAD.
PEDIGREED SUITOR : “Dear lady , I offer you
an ancient name and a long pedigree. ”
THE SOUATTER'S DAUGHTER: “Well, see pa
about it. He buys the stock for this run.”
of that predatory age when the hunting
of the female is the business of youth,
he had a trifling anair on his hands in the
form of a girl who sometimes called to see
him at the studio.
The Art Student, personally, was rather
tired of the aftair. llis girl, on whom he
had pressed his acquaintance one evening
on St. Kiida beach, had not turned out
either satisfactory or • good-looking. She
wore glasses, and her features were plain,
though she offered to the world those pro-
pitiatory qualities of the plain-featured, a
pleasant and affectionate disposition.
The predatory soul of 20 does not mind
plain features. It can pardon even a not
too pronouncedly pleasant and affectionate
disposition, but when the persistence of un-
affected virtue is added to the other disad-
vantages its patience is exhausted. But
he had pictured the affair as charming and
successful when lying to the Poet on the
subject, and the Poet, being one of those
fat incapables who batten on their friends,
had nailed him to a promise. He was
pledged to introduce the Poet to his girl’s
sister. This was easily arranged, for the
sister, it appeared, was anxious to meet a
poet.
So much, as an explanation of the im-
pending ceremony of ladies to be admitted
to the Poet’s chamber.
The preparations were now completed.
The photos well displayed and the rubbish
heap extinguished under the bed, a final
note was added from the Art Student’s
room adjoining in the form of an old Japan-
ese screen, some paper fans, and a large
study in the nude. Also from that apartment
came a bottle of sweet wine, some cigar-
ettes and six penn’orth of pastry in a paper
bag.
“I think that will about do,” said the
Poet, surveying the result with some pride.
His eye seemed to linger on the large nude,
as though he contemplated the effect of an
inscription in the corner dedicated to the
memory of youth’s fleeting hour, but he let it
pass for a more pressing inspiration. This
was to hastily spread several sheets of
manuscript poems on the table.
“When you get to the top of the stairs,”
he said, “talk loud so that I can hear. And
don’t knock. Just throw the door open sud-
denly.”
“What for?” inquired the mystified agent.
The Poet tapped him appreciatively on
the chest.
“I shall be seated writing a poem as you
come in.” he said. “You see the idea. I
start up in confusion, suddenly aware that
I am observed —and there you have the pic-
ture. Nothing like starting off an affair
with a woman artistically,” added the Poet,
with insane complacency.
The Art Student promptly applauded the
astuteness of this conception. In the base
interior of his mind he at once concluded
to betrav his friend by telling the girls about
it. Thus he would perhaps get in ahead
with the other girl if she chanced to be
better looking than his own.
“It’s about time you got a move on,”
added the unsuspecting Poet. “There’s the
clock striking the quarter to.”
The Art Student began to look for his
hat. This was the primary cause of a dis-
aster. He had inadvertently swept his hat
under the bed along with the other rubbish,
and in the act of abstracting it lie knocked
over a bickle bottle that was standing there
in secret.
Now if you knock over and smash a pickle
bottle that contains soup corked up for three
months, you will do a fearful thing. You
will let loose on helpless humanity an odor,
a stink, a ghastly and penetrating stench
that will stun your senses, shatter your
courage, remove all hope, and give you as a
prev to horror and desnair.
But one moment. How comes soup in a
pickle bottle, and how comes a pickle bottle
of soup under a poet’s bed? Here, my
friends, we touch deenly a question of the
subtler economies. If you, for instance,
were forced to subsist on a rate of income
averaged at five shillings a column, and
very few of those, your ingenuity might
perhaps go as far as to suggest the advisa-
bility of taking food home with you from
the restaurant you dine at. If you were
particularly ingenious you might even on
occasion fill the resturant’s own pickle
bottle with soup and carry it home for
breakfast. And even you, before resigning
yourself to slumber, might put the pickle
bottle under your bed and forget about it
altogether.
Enough has been said to explain the pre-
sence of that pickle bottle under the Poet’s
bed. The Poet had forgotten his criminal
hoard till it was too late, and now the
damnable thing had exploded its secret on
the very threshold of what promised to be a
charming interlude in the Poet’s life.
In the first horror of disaster the Poet
and the Art Student ran into the passage
and fought for breath till desperation drove
them back into the polluted chamber.
But what were such incompetents to do
faced with the hopelessness of exterminating
that nightmare of a stink? What use to
throw open windows, to agitate the atmo-
sphere with flourished towels, to pour alter-
nate libations of water, dust and kerosene
upon the hideous offence, to vociferate re-
criminations?
And in the midst of that demented scene
the Town Hall clock, like Fate, boomed out
the time for the ladies to arrive.
“Three o’clock,” yelled the Art Student,
snatching up his hat. “I’ll have to go—
they’ll be waiting. Do what you can to”—
He fled down the passage, followed by a
despairing howl that caught him on the
stairs —a frenzied appeal to keep away as
long as possible.
The Art Student was so flustered by the
mishap that when he met the girls at the
Town Hall corner he could not rise to the
occasion. For the occasion was worthy of
an effort. The sister of the plain girl was
surprisingly attractive. Even with the
secret of the exploded pickle bottle hanging
over him like a bad conscience, the Art
Student was aware of it. The alchemy that
had achieved this fine success in flesh and
blood seemed to have exhausted itself in
the effort, and had no further ingenuity to
spare for the plain girl. In a happier mo-
ment the traitorous youth would have made
an active bid for the prize, but under the
circumstances even he was oppressed by the
responsibility of personally conducting these
charms into the presence of that degrading
effluvia of defunct soup.
Reluctantly, at length, he brought them
to the Poet’s door, and reluctantly, accord-
ing to instructions, threw it wide open.
The Poet had proposed to make that
moment an impressive one, and the success
of his efforts staggered even the Art Student.
For a mad moment lie conceived that the
desperate occupant, in a last effort to
destroy his criminal pickle bottle, had set
fire to the building. Volumes of smoke
burst from the apartment and went bellying
down the passage. Within, in a sort of
inferno, there was presented to them a
vision of a strange, mad figure that held
aloft a burning torch. In a flash this vision
was exchanged for another —a figure that
danced upon his torch, that disappeared,
that re-appeared—hardly effective as the
presentment of a literary man disturbed at
work, but understood to be a poet—bowing
in the passage.
OUT OF THE RUNNING.
RUTH : “ Well, she was a sport. He was the
seventh fellow she was engaged to."
RUBY : “And now she's scratched for all
engagements. ”
They were all coughing, and the Poet was
explaining. His explanation was hardly
effective. He said that some brown paper
had caught fire by accident. And then it had
occurred to him to burn some old manu-
script. He seemed to suggest with feeble
humor that it was his burning-off day for
rejected poems. But he was very hot and
red and flustered, and he kept looking with
hatred at the Art Student for arriving too
soon. The girls made polite and interested
sounds, and kept peeping into the chamber
where these mysterious rites were held. The

Thus unfavorablv. it would seem, began
the love affair. But any girl with a pre-
disposition for an affair with a poet can
reconcile the gracious gambades of a poet’s
fancy with a soul-destroying smell. Such
things are at least a stab at the suburban
conventions. Anyway, in spite of the best
efforts of the Art Student to secure the
charming sister, the Poet got her. That is,
she fell with all the evidences of sincerity in
love with that ass. They met frequently, a
party of four, sometimes in the Art Stu-
dent’s studio, sometimes on St. Ivilda beach.
Sometimes it was their habit to buy wine
and sit embracing shamelessly bv daylight
in the Poet’s room. The Art Student
attended these functions unwillinglv. Ho

him thus to waste time on a tenderlv affec-

baffled him. Besides, he had picked up a

man faced with the awful responsibility of a
woman’s soul.
“To-night,” he would say, with exquisite
gloom, “I held that dear girl in my arms
for an hour. In that fine phrase of Steven-
son’s, ‘it was a wonderful clear night of
stars.’ She had thrown herself back in
my arms, her eyes closed, her lips just
parted—the attitude of a woman abandon-
ing herself to her lover.”
The Art Student, a liar by instinct, would
make sounds of appreciation. The Poet,
livening up to the possibilities of his theme,
would hitch his chair closer.
“Well, there she lay, to all intents and
purposes saying : ‘Take me —break me—l
am yours.’ Under the circumstances, what
was I to do?”
The views of the Art Student, a base
materialist, would not be found acceptable
here. The Poet would pass them with a
gentle air of disavowal as one who under-
stood the meaner mind, and pai’doned it, but
could not stoop to basely act.
“No, no! my dear fellow. No, no!” he
would say. “You cannot undei-stand. I
have had affairs, many affaii’s, in which I
was as indifferent to the finer issues as you
are yourself. I don’t claim to be an honor-
able man, far from it. We, to whom Life
is the mere material of Art, cannot hesitate
to use that material. A soul more or less,
what does that matter?” A gesture of his
hand, a certain air of resignation, told of
souls sacrificed to the terrible cold yet boil-
ing frenzy of the Artist. Then, hastening
to his theme again, he would rehearse the
story of his grand perplexity.
Here was a beautiful girl prepared to
give herself wholly to him, her life, her body,
her soul. But —could he accept the gift?
Was this to be merely the brutal battle of
sex, or was it to be—something higher?
“I confess I am sufficiently cynical to
ask myself that question, and to have my
doubts.” said the Poet gloomily. *
But he continued to have his doubts and
air his doubts, and enjoy his doubts im-
mensely.
How much of this gasconading was true,
or pertinent to actuality, how much of the
Poet’s stern rectitude was mere caution,
how much of his noble restraint was funk
of the possible consequences, or how much
was simply incompetence the Art Student
could not decide. As a base materialist
who knew the Poet to be a liar, he was in-
clined to give his friend credit for not tell-
ing the whole truth, or half of it.
A new element suddenly precipitated the
affair from the windily sentimental into tlie
unexpectedly discomposing.
On the occasion that this element was in-
troduced the Poet came home in a dis-
tinctly bad temper. Instead of hurrying to
the feast of confession and depression, he
sat down in a disgruntled manner and bor-
rowed some tobacco. And then he took off
his boots and cursed because he owned a
corn. The spectacle of a fat Poet attending
to a corn with a blunt knife is not one to
lightly associate with the grand passion.
Nor was it the gi-and passion, or the corn,
that was responsible for the Poet’s depres-
sion. That fact was apparent when lie at
length was forced to relieve his mind in
speech.
“The fact is,” he said, dividing a scowl
between the Art Student and the corn, “her
old man’s got to hear about the business,
and he’s as mad as a hatter about it. He’s
found out about her coming up here, and
there’s been the devil of a row at home—
in fact, she’s been told to drop coming up
here, and, in fact, to drop me,” said the
Poet.
The Art Student was delighted to hear
this.
“Hai’d luck, old chap,” he said.
“Of course she’s just the sort of girl to
tell the old man to go to the Devil,” said
the Poet; and he added after a gloomy
pause, “There’s no doubt she’s devilishly
fond of me.”
She must have been, for the situation
developed with alarming rapidity.
It was her father who chiefly exploited
his wrath as a means of reducing order in
his household. The Poet had never seen
this potentate, but he was known to be an
engineer by profession, an Orangeman by
birth and fate, a Single Taxer and a non-
smoker by conviction, and an angry man
by preference.
As a combination of these characteristics
he was naturally also an extremely intol-
erant man on the subject of poets. Edward
Batters, in daily receipt of his latest utter-
ances on this noint —utterances rendered
ever fiercer by the rebellion they inspired—
became under such mental stimulus rather
inclined to alter his perspective vision of
the affair. In his frequent burst of fprensic
elucidation of it for the Art Student’s bene-
fit. the point of view was seen to be rather
less a question of a passionate lover faced
with the responsibility of a confiding
woman’s soul, and l-ather moi-e a question
of an anxious fat youth involved in the
necessity of dodging a determined woman.
Not that he put it in that way. The
point, as evolved by Edward Batters, was
—would it not be tlie more generous course
for him to voluntarily resign the girl. For
observe! He had involved her in trouble.
Further, he had involved her in the possible
loss of a home. What, then, had he to offer
her in exchange for this loss? Could he—
he appeared to boggle at the word “marry,”
and changed it to —“support her?” Out
of the question. Could he ask her to share
the life he led? Equally out of the ques-
tion. He loved her, of course, bxit surely
this sacrifice he was prenared to make was
the best —in fact, the only possible proof of
his affection for her.
Arrived at this conclusion, he became the
ostentatious prey of melancholy.
He was so relieved, in fact. that over their
sixpenny-restaurant dinner one evening
during the period of stress, his grief became
greatly stimulated by the nobility of his
act of renunciation. And as they walked
home together he was moved to admit the
Art Student to a deeper note of intimaev
still.
“My God.” he said, “no one will know
what that girl has meant to me !”
The Art Student, being constitutionally
incapable of believing in the finer emotions,
said he could quite realise it.
“No, my dear Partridge.” said the Poet,
“you cannot realise it. I eonfess to yon.
frankly, that until this awful necessity of
parting I did not realise it mvsolf. Ah,
well,” the Poet gave a very creditable imita-
tion of a man h’tterlv awakened to remorse,
‘one cannot play lightly with the finer
issues. 1 see that now.”
And a little later lie had a fine, illuminat-
ing thought.
“Partridge,” he said darkly, “if I hadn’t
spared that girl I would have been spared
this. If our passion had run its course, this
would have been the proper ending. One
would have smiled, and been a little sad,
and so —ended it.”
With that he strode on again, lost in the
terrible conflict of his soul.
Once he allowed Partridge to see him
wracked by a sudden indecision.
“But why should I give her up —why?”
he demanded of the universe. The universe,
in the form of Partridge, failing to supply
an answer, the Poet ejaculated, “I’m
AFTER THE WALTZ.
HER HUSBAND'S BROTHER (who had to be invited): “Say, Missus, this ’ere on'andled filly yer
paired me orf with can't canter worth a damn. I'm sweatin' like a ’ orse!”
damned if I’ll give her up!” And wrap-
ping himself in a mantle of implacable de-
termination he stalked upstairs, with Part-
ridge and the universe sniggering secretly
behind him.
But Fate seemed to have made a note of
the Poet’s last gambade, for on the top of
the stairs somebody was waiting for him—
somebody who said in an agitated voice:
“Is that you, Ted —Teddie?”
The Poet’s garment of determination
dwindled and departed from him. lie said,
“What the de\il are you doing there,
Millie ?”
“Wa-waiting to see you.”
The Poet sought in his pocket for a
match, struck it, and disclosed Millie in
agitation, with marks of tears on her face.
He turned abruptly and led the way to
his room, Millie following, and the Art Stu-
dent, that obsequious Panurge, solicitously
supporting her with his arm.
The Poet lit a candle, and by it's light
the situation wais illuminated.
“I’ve cleared out from home,” said Millie.
“What?” shouted Milton.
Millie wiped her eyes. “I couldn’t stand
it any longer,” she said. “Father’s been
going on like a pig. He thinks writers and
artists are horrible people. He won’t listen
to reason. He” —
The Poet took a distracted turn about the
apartment, sat down, and got up again. He
made several efforts to say something,
found he couldn’t say it. and with a des-
perate gesture suddenly lit his pipe. The
Art Student, assuming on his own initiative
the functions of host, sat Millie on the bed,
gave her a cigarette, and held a match for
her.
“Thanks.” said Millie plaintively. Then
she took off her hat. stuck hatpins in it.
and cast it aside. This action seemed mys-
teriously to dispel the burden of her care.
“Bother the old man,” she said. “Why
should / go on having the soul case w’orried
out of me for no earthly reason. If he
wants something to make a fuss about, he
can have it.”
“Well said,” remarked the Art Student.
“I said I’d go if I had any more' of it,”
said Millie, “and I will—l mean I have.
And I won’t go back again, either.”
“Don’t you, old girl.” said the sycophant.
“I won’t,” said Millie. “If it hadn’t been
for that fool of a Fanny telling Mother all
about the afternoons we used to have here
he wouldn’t have known anything about it.
But as he prefers to think such frightful
immoralities go on up here, he can, and I
wish him joy of his suspicions.”
The Poet savagely struck a match. He
rose.
“Millie.” he said, “I consider that you’ve
done a dam’ silly thing. Not only that,
you’ve involved yourself in a dangerous and
difficult situation.”
The Art Student had one of his fatal im-
pulses. “Not only that.” he said, “you’ve
involved Teddie in it too.”
“It’s no question.” c aid the Poet, eyeing
him with hate, “of ME. For myself. I care
nothing. But I’m not going to sit here and
allow Millie to make a fool of herself for
no earthly reason. Once found here, she is
hopelessly compromised. Millie, there is no
other way out of it. You’ll have to go
home.”
“I will not!” said Millie.
“But you must,” ejaculated the Poet,
suddenly distracted. ‘You must. You can’t
stop here. It’s impossible. I wouldn’t be
such a hound as to permit”—
Millie made a petulant gesture. “I
never said I was going to stay here.” she
said. “I can stay with my friend Florrie
Murphy, I suppose.”
The Poet, deprived suddenly of the neces-
sity for further eloquence, sat down. The
Art Student sniggered. He permitted him-
self a cryptic utterance. He said, “All’s
well.”
The Poet ignored him. He suddenly be-
came the strong man, master of the situa-
tion. He also took up his hat.
“I have something to say to you,” he
said to Millie. “Kindly put on your hat.”
Millie sniffed for a moment and applied
a handkerchief delicately to her nose. At
length she began to put on her hat. She
made a slow process of this, profound silence
reigning. Then she pulled on one glove,
buttoned it, and slowly pulled on the other.
“Are my eyes red?” she asked the Art
Student at length.
“Not a bit.” said that sycophant heartily.
They shook hands, and the Poet led her
implacably away.
It was late when he returned, and the
Art Student had retired to bed. The Poet
strode into his own apartment, and banged
the door as a hint that conversation was not
desired that night. And as a further hint of
his august displeasure the Poet threw his
boots hard at the floor. The Art Student
sniggered complacently.
For three days the Poet did not allude to
the subject of his grand passion. He per-
sisted in an attitude that suggested there
was a coolness between himself and the Art
Student. But their habit of life was much to-
gether, and presently the; Poet was busy once
more, like the Scrip-
tural dog, exploiting
the remnants of his
exploded romance.
“Yes,” he said, “it
is all over. The cur-
tain is down at last
on what, without
affectation, one can
truly call a Drama of
the Human Heart.”
lie gloomed a' moment
over this statement,
as though finding it
rather effective, and
added, resignedly : “It
was inevitable, of
course, that the end
should come in some
way like this.”
“Like what?” de-
manded the ' material-
ist.
,The Poet made a
weary gesture.
“My God. man !” he
said. “Even you must
have seen that the
situation had become
impossible. lam only
human, after all. That
night—the last night she came here He
fixed the Art Student with terrible impres-
siveness. “That night I almost succumbed.
My God. what a temptation However”
He forced himself, as by an effort, # to a
more human consideration of the affair.
“I told her that night that we must part.
I told her that I could not hold myself re-
sponsible for what might happen if we con-
tinued to meet. I told her, in fact, that an
innocent girl like herself could not under-
stand what an effect her beauty had on a
man of my temperament.”
“What did she say to that?” inquired the
materialist.
“She cried,” said the Toet solemnly, “as
though her heart were breaking. My dear
chap.” he laid a hand upon the Art Stu-
dent’s shoulder, as one who bestows the
benediction of his terrible knowledge, “my
dear chap, I hope you will never w
what it means to give up for ever theonlv
woman you have ever loved." only
With this fine sentiment linaerinv
him like a halo, he went forth with
Student and dined with gloomy gusto
their sixpenny restaurant. And after
ner-the Poet bein,; then in n n„ od S
gentle resignation—they had a shinn, *
worth of music-hall entertainment from
the gallery. It was after 11 when they re
turned home, and the Poet, lighting the
candie to indulge once again in the melan-
choly of his great renunciation, discovered
a slip of paper thrust under his door T
was a note, scribbled hastily in pencil' and
it said : ’
Dear Teddie,—l have been waiting to see von
since six and it is now past eight. I must see you
* have h ad a row with Florrie Murphy
She thinks I ought to go home. I never will ‘
nothing wi ll induce me. I can’t believe that you
meant that we were to part. I shall call to-morrow
at three o clock. Do be nice to me.
Your own Millie.
The melancholy departed from E. Ratters
as he read it. Something like desperation
seemed to possess him—the desperation of
a hunted dog.
“Read that,” he said, casting it at the
Art Student.
The Art Student read it. “Oho!” was
all he remarked.
Edward threw himself into the cane
lounge, which was unwise of him. When
he at length managed to extricate himself
from the ruin, he said fiercely: “That settles
the dam’ thing.”
“You oughtn’t to have sat in it,” re-
marked the Art Student, pleased with this
mishap.
The Poet repressed himself with an
effort.
“I wasn’t speaking of the dam’ chair.”
he said. “I was speaking about this." lie
picked up the note. “You know,” he said,
“what I have done to save this girl. I have
had to fight myself as no man ever fought
before. And now on top of it all” lie
shook the note. “You see what this means?”
The materialist made interrogative
sounds. He had his opinion of what it
meant, but repressed his opinion.
“It means,” said the Poet, “that I can no
longer be held responsible for the conse-
quences.” He cast the note down with an
air of deadly finality. “To-morrow,” he
said, “she becomes my Prey.”
On that dreadful understanding he went
to bed.
In the morning he came to the Art Stu-
dent and said casually, “Can vou lend me
a ouid or two?”
The Art Student couldn’t, but lent him
15 shillings, which was all he had, so lie
said. The Poet took that sum, and went
off humming. He did not turn up at the
hour of three, though Millie did, and waited
for him in the Art Student’s room. She
waited till six, and the Art Student enter-
tained her. Then he took her out to dinner,
and back to the studio, on the understand-
ing that the Poet might have turned up.
But by half-past 10 the victim of passion
was still absent, so the Art Student took
her home to Florrie Murphy.
For a week the Poet’s absence remained
a mystery, none knowing where he lurked.
It was the postman who exploded the secret
by thrusting a letter under the Art Stu-
dent’s door. The letter bore the post-mark
of Sydney, and it said :
Dear Partridge,—l would be obliged if you can
manage to collar my books and papers, and keep
them for me until I send you an address. The
furniture of my room I bestow upon you as a gift,
if it hasn’t been seized for rent. You will find my
kev over the door. Work seems brisk here. I have
sold two articles already.
Yours as heretofore, Edward Batters.
And that was all. The strong man had
fled. He had conquered his passion in a
hurry and bolted to Sydney. In fact.
Edward Batters, that impostor, faced sud-
denly with the darling creation of Ins
fancy, a grand passion, had found night
his only solution. Too long he had toyed
with the presentment of himself as a burn-
ing lover. lie had not taken into considera-
tion the possibility of being suddenly taken
at his word. Like the youth in the fable
who cried wolves, he was unprepared toi
the appearance of a wolf.

Tonga.
OHAVE you heard of Tonga, a rummy
little place ?
A King rules there, in purple, by
Britain’s saving grace,
With “Ministers” and "Nobles,” and “Par-
liaments” which meet
Triennially only, and then just meet to eat.
O have you heard of Tonga, that lone Pacific
realm,
Those lingering, last islands with Brown
Men at the helm?
Some coral-heaps and atolls, soiue bits of
palm-fringed beach,
Where squat some Tired Apostles who live
to sing and preach.
That’s all there is of Tonga. Not much to
write about;
Not much to make exploiters or tourists rave
and spout.
Therein lies its salvation, not many know
of it,
It’s out beyond the maelstrom, and doesn’t
mind a bit.
Therein lies its salvation. By reason of its
great,
Its regal unimportance, it rests a Native
Stat#.
A bit anachronistic, as wags the world to-
day.
But pretty as a picture and funny as a play.
With olden rules fast changing and giving
place to new,
Stagnation’s a refreshing and novel thing to
view;
And nowhere is stagnation more wholly at
its best
Than just in “Holy Tonga's” division of The
Blest.
A land of peace and plenty; a group of
goody-goods
In precept, though in practice it has its
naughty moods,
A race the cognoscenti, with justice, claim
to be
By far the best-off people in this quaint
Southern Sea.
Some visitors grow carping. They judge
the place asleep.
They say it’s so untidy it makes the Angels
weep.
But Heaven holds no judgment for aught
that Tongans do.
They long ago annexed it. and all its Angels,
too.
You’re narrow, little Tonga; you’re what
the Scots call “blate.”
Your only book’s the Bible, which isn’t up
to date.
You’ve had no chance to learn things ; but
don’t know what you miss,
And ignorance, in your case, I’m fain to
think, spells bliss.
Wrapped up in self-contentment, you dream
from day to day.
You don’t know what you’re here for. (Do
we know, anyway ?)
You only see you’re living, you feel the
earth is fair,
You’ve found a satisfaction we can’t find
anywhere.
O hanpy, lazy Tonga, you tiny, useless land l
There’s neither fame nor money to harvest
from your strand.
I know you breed’ unfitness; hut, when we
come to part,
There’s something in you, Tonga, keeps tug-
ging at my heart.

A Pagan Christmas Carol.
The first act in the Saturnalia, which lasted’ from
five to seven days, was the removal by the women of
the woollen fetters which bound the statue of the
god’. Afterwards pigs were sacrificed, and' the reign
of license began. Yuletide, which corresponded to the
Saturnalia among the Northern peoples, was held at
the time when the Yule or Wheel of the year began
to revolve upwards.
WE killed’ a pig to Saturn
When Rome was in her pride,
And watched the roasting fat turn
To lard to baste his side ;
The seven hills have seen us
Green-crowned in love and drink
When ancient Palatinus
Was painted rosy pink ;
For Christmastide was gay with revel
Before the glad world found the Devil-.
Still Christmastide is cheery,
The mad young world is gay
Where bibulous and beery
It staggers down the way
With loud and kindly greeting,.
Handclasp and hoary jest,
The Christian world is eating
The things it loves the best;
And, Chifistmas carols follow after
The riot of old pagan laughter.
We set the Yule log burning
In snow-lands wide and drear,
When first day’s white wheel turning
Proclaimed the waking year,
And round each glowing ember,
E'er Thor's red cheek grew pale,
We crowned the wild December
With horns of flowing ale ;
Old Christmastides were vowed to folly
E’er churchmen mixed their prayers with
holly.
And still to ancient Saturn,
’Mid Christmas carols clear,
Our Sissy’s blouse and hat turn
When halts the rolling year;
White hands his feet untether
From bonds of Wowser wool,
And all in golden weather
The glad world plays the fool —
Young pagan riot follows after
The Christian interlude with laughter!

GEORGE STREET.
The Dregs of the Cup.
ALONG the grey bush hoary, the splen-
did sunlight streams,
In far-flung golden glory, in tangled
dusty gleams.
T\ hat means its magic now for me, I who
have done with dreams?
“I cannot sing the old songs,” I cannot
weave again
The tender dreams, the olden gleams that hid
the path of pain.
The sun is but the sun to me, the rain is
hut the rain.
No more are mine illusions, the veil is torn
away.
I see no more the rose-hues that tinted all
the grey.
lhe night is but the night for me, the day is
just the day.
I pray no more the old prayers, I break no
more or mend
The tuneless heart within me. I hold no
more a friend,
As dear as loves of lonelier days, nor shall
unto the end.
Toiling and rest, some pleasure, to eat, to
drink, to sleep,
Is life’s whole lot, but I would not forget the
way to weep;
Though even pain brings not again the olden
torture deep.
Life s edge is dull and blunted, and only grey
ghosts go
Where walked in Youth’s wild morning
dream-faces all aglow,
And rosemary is blooming where the roses
used to blow.
Yet sometimes in the gloaming, ere the black
night shadows fall,
I hold review of mine own dead (they
gather at my call),
And know of thoughts most sad and grey
the saddest thought of all
Is that I care no longer, no pain is now
so deep,
Nor any. pleasure half so swmet; no harvest
I might reap
Would for me be worth a handful of the
poppy-flowers of Sleep.

KATHLEEN WALKER.
The Land of Cap and Bells.
HIDES and tallow and wool and
wheat
In the holds of ships they stored,
Out of port by day and night
Marrow of the country poured.
Raucous voices loud in laud,
Praised the riches of the land ;
North and south and east and west
Cried it great on every hand.
Here, a politician raved —
Facts portraying, hued in gold—
Theresa writer'spread his" soul,
Telling tales of wealth untold.
Men at corners, pipe in mouth,
Hands in pockets, slouched at ease—
Horse-talk, hog-talk, talk of pelf
Spoiled and soiled the wholesome breeze.
Hefty foot and nimble voice,
Negro-fist and puppet-show,
Held the fool-crowd, night and noon,
Breathless, gaping, eyes aglow.
Mad —beyond all painting—mad !—
Strange as aught that poet tells—
Was that moth-dance round the flame
In the Land of Cap and Bells.
Yet there sits alone, apart,
Hidden where no man may see—
One, dark-eyed, and pale of face,
And she weaves unceasingly.
Destiny her name—and she
(While the far mad chorus swells)
Weaves with crimson thread the fate
Of the Land of Cap and Bells.

Change.
Everything fades and passes,
Like dew from the summer
grasses.
Cyclopean cities of old
The dust of the ages hold.
No worshippers adore
The Cretan Minotaur.
The wild goats penetrate
Mykene’s Lion-Gate.
The statesman plots and plans,
The tinker mends pots and pans ;
Pots must be mended again, ,
Empires dissolve like rain.
Achilles’ noble craze
Sets Troy-town in a blaze.
The thunderous hero’s glory
Will make a children’s story,
The sack of the sacred city,
A young man’s drinking ditty. -
Nor Art remains, in sooth,
To check Time’s venomed tooth.
Of air sweet songs are made,
The loveliest frescoes fade ;
The sculptor carves in snow
Like Michael Angelo.
Father of Death and Life,
Is Change, the child of Strife.
Life flows like a swift stream,
A cloud, a smoke, a dream.
Our hopes and fears, they pass
Like shadows on the grass.
We learn the legend’s pith
Man, too, is but a myth.

A Wild Night at Wollongong.
IT’S wild to-niglit off Wollongong. ’Neath
rain-swept Keira’s frown,
The misty gas lamps throw a bleary
gleam upon the town.
The streets are quite deserted, and the
houses all seem shrunk,
It’s wild to-night off Wollongong— to-night
we must get drunk!
It’s wild to-night off Wollongong, the sou’-
east gale roars high,
Huge combers on the lighthouse crash —the
“stand-off” signals fly,
The people huddle round their fires, and
curse the dismal rain,
It's wild to-night off
fill ’em up again !
It’s wild to-night off Wollongong; we’ll let
the world go hang,
The windows rattle in their frames, the
doors close with a bang;
The Wowser on a night like this, crawls
early to its bunk,
But men of common sense (like us) get
absolutely drunk!
It s wild to-night off Wollongong, it’s very
very wild,
With language blue, on nights like this, the
air is much defiled.
The streets are merely muddy bogs ; yea
brother, we have sunk
Ud to our fetlocks in ’em all, and now we’re
getting drunk !
It’s wild to-night off Wollongong, the cop-
ner s eerie form
In rustling macintosh strides past, rigged
(t out to brave the storm.
“Come, stalwart p’lieeman, come inside and
5 have a taste. Don’t funk.”
It s wild to-night off Wollongong, but we get
tamely drunk !
It’s wild to-night off Wollongong, but what
; care we for that?
We’ve got a stock of whisky in, ’twould fill
a fair-sized vat.
To-night we mean to drink enough to swamp
a Chinese junk.
It’s wild to-night off Wollongong. Cheer up,
we re getting drunk !
It s wild to-night off Wollongong; it oft-
times is the same,
And if we do get blitherish the weather is to
blame;
We 11 drink till we are speechless, pards.
Cosh ! ’ow them cole blarsh sing !
We re drunk to-night in Wollongosh ! We’re
drunk as anyshing !

Ballade of Bitter Memories.
WE build and gather, in vain, in vain,
Tempests of Chance with our
castles play,
The weevil winnows the gold o’ the grain,
Gold o’ the morning glooms to the grey.
Shall we weep for our idols of painted -clay-?" —
Salt dews of sorrow the sere blooms
wetting—-
Nay, gods of the desert of Dreadful Day,
Give us the gift of a great forgetting!
The hemlock cup to the dregs we drain,
But the lotus islands beyond the bay
On the purple twilight are scarce a stain,
And the fairy boatmen are far away.
Baffled and blind and athirst we pray.
From the fitful fever and fierce, blood-
sweating.
Gods of the desert of Dreadful Day,
Give us the gift of a great forgetting!
A twisted shard and a rusted chain,
A dying camp-fire beside the way,
A smoke-wreath blown to the blue of the
plain,
A swan-song flung to the vast for aye.
Was it spectral hands on the strings astray,
Or a wishful wind at the casement fret-
ting?
Gods of the desert of Dreadful Day,
Give us the gift of a great forgetting!
The hot pulse slackens, the years bewray.
Life is a canvas of Fate’s vignetting—
Gods of the desert of Dreadful Day,
Give us the gift of a great forgetting!

God and Eternity.
Trillions of years ago
A wizard lived by the flow
Of the timeless, boundless sea ;
And a cunning wizard was he.
For he took in the palm of his hand
A little water and sand,
And he chanted a seven-fold rhyme,
And he made a magic called time.
And he made most marvellous things !
Lands and peoples and kings,
And shapes of truth and of error,
And love and beauty and terror.
And dreams that trouble the mind,
And the shadow that lies behind
The dark o’ the stars, and fire,
And fear and hate and desire.
And last he made good and evil.
And invented a wonderful Devil;
And all the peoples adored
The holy Name of the Lord.
Trillions of years ago
These things began to be so,
But the timeless, boundless sea
Abides still patiently.
And when trillions of years have passed,
Will remain by its shore at last,
Of the wizard and all he planned,
A little water and sand.

A. M. BOWYER-ROSMAN.
A Confused Matter of Cows and
Reincarnation.
place I fell across the cow
Was high and steep and full of fear.
The tall cliff’s stony-furrowed brow
Dropped down a hundred fathoms sheer
The cow was lying in the way,
And it was dark as Judgment day.
Let me explain. I rode a bike.
I did not know the cow was there. ,
Her hair and hide I chanced to strike
Just where three hundred feet of air,
Instead of rock or solid ground,
Caught my front wheel on the rebound.
Then there was nothing under me
Except plain wind for my support;.
The somersaults I turned were three—-
One to the starboard, two to port;
And after that I fell down plumb
Right in the jaws of Kingdom Come.
The river running down below
, J knew was very large and old.
I heard the angry waters flow
And feared that I should catch a cold.
My fall I treated with dislike
And clung with both hands to the bike.
I had a frightful way to fall,
And as 1 felt the air divide
I fancied for a while that all
T My soul was getting loose inside ;
Unless kind fortune used her art
1 knew my soul and I must part.
I started down at half-past nine,
I know not when 1 reached the rock.
I saw the rushing waters shine
And braced myself to meet the shock;
But-as the matter really stood
The bracing did me little good.
I smashed myself in many bits.
The river washed the mess away ;
And then, as some small mist that flits
Out of the skies of yesterday,
1 knew that what was left of me
Was only just a memory.
Upon the whole I think I found
The job of being nothing much
More pleasant than the endless round
Of truth and teeth and tripe and touch,
For, sitting like a vapor curled,
My soul despised the living world.
Then something called my name aloud,
And I must needs get up and go
To where, amid a silver cloud,
Soft lights were moving to and fro.
At five o'clock one Friday morn
I found that I was freshly born.
Three years went by. A simple child,
I grew in stature day by day.
My father toiled, my mother smiled,
I learned with dolls and dirt to play;
And then I woke to sudden pain
When someone called me Mary Jane.
More years rolled-on. 1 bought a bike
And wandered up and down the world,
In eager hope to somewhere strike
The spot from which I first was hurled
I thought that if I over-ran
The cliff I might return a man.
Yet nowhere could I find a cow
Asleep upon the dizzy turn
Of some high place whose awful brow
My spinning wheels might lightly spurn ;
But peace returned to me again
When first George called me Mary Jane.
He breathed the name in such a tone,
I ceased to worry o’er my state.
I claimed his whiskers as my own,
And recognised him as my fate.
For when I touched his hairy cheek
My restless soul grew calm and meek.
But times have changed. With George I
ride
To find that beetling, headlong cliff;
He does not know how much his bride
Longs to bump beef in darkness if
Together both could fall through space
And wake in that pre-natal place.
Then I as he and he as I
Might rush with haste to be re-born,
And George would grow amaiden shy,
While whiskers should my jaw adorn.
For fate would make it very plain
That George was merely Mary Jane.

That’s a plain, straightforward statement,
and the words mean exactly what they say
Gin Pills must cure your Back-
ache, Bladder, Kidney, or Urinary
Troubles, or we are obliged to re-
fund your money.
They must cure, or your money will
be cheerfully refunded.
You are to be the judge and jury.
Your word will be accepted
as final.
Your money will be re-
funded without quibble or
argument of any kind if
Gin Pills do not effect
a cure. Consider what this
method of doing business
means.
It means that tve have posi-
tive knowledge of the cura-
tive properties of Gin
Pills.
It means that Gin Pills
will cure 99 cases.of Back-
ache, Kidney, Bladder or
Urinary Troubles out of every
100.
We know that —know it positively.
It also means that we have a large
faith in the honesty of men and
women.
We do not believe that a single man
or woman out of one hundred who
have suffered the torments of
Backache, Kidney, Bladder or
Urinary Troubles would deny the
cure Gin Pills assure. 99
out of every 100 would joyously
admit it.
?SHELDOW
[sHaVen'Dßue c
This extraordinary offer is made
because of these facts :
The known medicinal properties of
Gin Pills and the honesty of
human nature.
Each Gin Pill contains all the con-
- stituents of a pint of the finest gin com-
bined with other diuretics by
a new method and process,
and form a remedy which
effects cures in 99 cases out
of 100.
Gin Pills are put up in
glass bottles hermetically
sealed, and we sell them to
you with the absolute guar-
antee that if they do not
cure you we will refund
your money.
They are sold in two size
bottles, at l/6, or in larger
bottles, holding more than
double the quantity, at 2/6.
Buy a large bottle at 2/6, and give
them a fair test ; use- two-thirds of
the bottle, and if you feel they are
not benefiting you, return your bottle
to the chemist or storekeeper from
whom you purchased them, and he
will refund you the money, or com-
municate direct with the Sheldon
Drug Company, Ltd., 15 O'Connell
Street, Sydney.
Under these conditions is it not
worth while for any sufferer from
Backache, Kidney, Bladder or Urin-
ary Troubles to at once test this new
remedy ?

An Expert, writing to Country Life,
says :
. . . “ There is also another advantage
they possess which, to my mind, is of
very great importance ; this is that the
powder, cases, wads, and, most im-
portant of all, the caps are made by
the same firm, and they are therefore
all made exadtly to suit each other,
and are put together only by those
interested in their success. There is
no doubt that other powder-makers are
at a great disadvantage in this respedt.”

A Profitable Christmas
®. Prosperous New Year
FOR THE RETAILERS WHO INSTAL A
NELSON SODA FOUNTAIN!
Bis crowds constantly gather around a Nelson Soda Fountain in the hot weather
(they simply can’t resist it!), and “big crowds” mean “big money.” Every Class
of Retailer will be a richer man if he instals a Nelson Iceless Interior. But
it must be a “NELSON.” These are imported direct from the biggest and best
Soda Fountain Manufacturers in the world. They cost just a little more than
the locally-made article, but are fifty times better. This we can PROVE. All
the men who know —the men of long experience—would never tolerate any sort
of Iceless Interior but the “Nelson” kind. WRITE to-day for more details. No
time to delay.

Three and a half Years in London
Three Years at Ipswich, England,
and Thirty Years in Melbourne
Covers the places and time I have given
to the study of All Capillary Diseases as
they affect the Scalp and Hair.
There is no Quackery, about this Re-
cord. Thirty years of publicity in one
place, not in the baekblocks, but in the
main street of the great metropolis of
Victoria, and doing business with the
whole of the Commonwealth, proves be-
yond a doubt that I have made good.
That the sufferers with Scalp Diseases
and Hair Troubles appreciate my skill
is shown by the testimonials which come
to hand every day, speaking in eloquent
language of the great benefit they have
received from my treatment. Not only
in the Commonwealth, but far beyond its
confines, my name is known as repre-
senting skill in the treatment of scalp
and hair troubles generally.
A lady writes from Paris: —“I shall be
pleased if you will forward to me in
London some of your famous Hair Re-
storer. We always used it when in
Australia, and we cannot get anything ro
equal it.”
MISS M'DOWELL writes from Italy:
“For twenty-five years you treated my
hair successfully with Phytoline and
Restorer while living at Toorak. Since
coming to this country, four years ag°,
I have lost all my hair, and cannot get
anything here to make it grow. Please
send me the above treatment.”
A LADY leaving England was told by
one of the leading specialists in London,
if she had any scalp or hair troubles to
call and see me, as I was looked upon as
one of the leading men in the profession.
One of the leading doctors in Melbourne
says :—“lf there is anything in the world
that will make your hair grow, Mr. Hol-
land’s preparations will. I can recom-
mend them with confidence, knowing them
to be of the most genuine character.”
DR. ADAMS, of Inglewood, writes:
“Tlease forward me the usual half-dozen
bottles of Parasene. It suits my scalp
and hair better than any other prepara-
tion.”
MRS. GOLDSMITH, Hawthorn,
states: “My doctor, on examining the side
of my head, which was quite bare, told me
that the hair would never grow again. I
am pleased I came to you, as I have now
a splendid growth of hair on the bald
patch.”
MY TREATMENT IS THE BEST—
Because a life’s experience is at the
back of it. Speaking of a new beginner,
the Americans would say he has got to
make good. To make good in its best
seme is to show by your conduct and
ability that you are the right man in
the right place—that you have the trained
ability to meet the condition imposed upon
you, and by the practical result of that
ability you are able to gain the confidence
of the people who are in need of your
skill. The best possible proof that a
man has met every reasonable claim
made upon him is the length of time he
has stayed in one place. A man of little
skill and no reputation does not as a
rule stay long in one place. He must
be ever on the move, or he would quickly
starve.
Gentlemen who are going bald should
use SPECIAL PARASENE and COSMO
LOTION, one at night and the other in
the morning, and wash the head once a
week with SHAMPUNA.
PRICE (with postage, two months’
treatment) : Victoria, 12/-; four months,
22/6. Other States, 12/6 and 23/6.
LADIES with hair falling out should
apply RESTORER at night and COSMO
LOTION in the morning, and wash with
SHAMPUNA as often as necessary.
NATUIIALINE is a splendid prepara-
tion for coloring Grey Hair. It acts
quickly, naturally and effectively, and
is perfectly harmless. Made in all colors.
Get the right strength.
No. 1 for Light Brown Hair; Medium

KYNOCH GAS ENGINE
Just Consider This!
All who use a Suction Gas Plant KNOW
that it is far more economical and up-to-
date than steam. The cost of running a
Kynoch Suction Gas Engine has been
proved to be less than half the cost of
running a high-grade steam plant.
Consider what this economy amounts to
in the course of a year ?

Diamonds e=
ENORMOUSLY
REDUCED!
OVER 12 months ago we secured a
Sole Agency that called for an
enormous output, and to live up
to it we decided to try the experiment
of offering Diamonds at merely a com-
mission on landed cost.
The experiment created such an in-
crease in our customers that we have
decided to continue it for another 12
months.
We are, therefore, offering Diamonds
(unset or set in Jewellery), at prices
less than those of London. There is no
duty on Diamonds, and our stock is one
of great range and best quality.

Many men use an old-fashioned razor because
the blade can be kept in such perfect condition
by stropping. Not everyone knows that the
Auto Strop Safety Razor gives just this kind
of edge combined with all the advantages of a
safety razor. It “strops itself in 12 seconds
without removing the blade, and makes self-
shaving not only possible but most desirable*
STROPS ITSELF AND SAVES
CONSTANT EXPENSE FOR BLADES.
Obtainable of all high class dealers throughout Australasia.

clean, cool, close shave that only a stropped blade can give.

INJUNCTIONS AGAINST PASSING OFF.
Latest Case.—SCHWEPPES v. O’CONNOR.
In the Supreme Court, Queensland, before his Honor Mr. Justice Real and a jury of four.
(See Brisbane Couriers, August 21 to September 13, in ivhich an Injunction was granted.)
During this case, which lasted 12 days, the following evidence was given, showing the health-giving properties of Sarto and the amount of Sarsaparilla contained therein.
“George Alexander Byrn, member of the firm of Dixon and Byrn, assayers and analysts, of Sydney, deposed lhat he had made analyses of a bottle of ‘Sarto’ and a bottle
of ‘Sarsa.’ lie found that ‘Sarto’ contained 11.47 per cent, of solids, .lON of similieia, and the balance consisted of water and a small quantity of alcohol. Sarsa comaine
13.15 of solids and .006 per cent, of similieia, and the balance consisted of water and a small quantity of alcohol. There was, therefore, eighteen times as much similieia
‘Sarto’ as there was in ‘Sarsa.’ Similieia was the active principle of sarsaparilla; it was a medicinal tonic. There were other properties of sarsaparilla ot median
value, but the active principle was similieia.” ~ . . (S 3 , „ , lT „
Mr. Feez: “How does ‘Sarto’ compare with ‘Sarsa’ according to your analysis?”—“There is a finer quality of sarsaparilla in Sarto than there is in Sarsa. • .
correct to say that some sarsaparilla root may have no similieia at all?” —“Yes.” “What does the presence of >ION per cent, of similieia indicate to you. OIU^
best sarsaparilla root has been used in the preparation.” “Is that a large or a small quantity for a drink of that kind. A very iair amount.
