sheets which can be fastened to existing walls or on to the studs when
building anew. It is a more desirable interior finish than plaster, more
sensible than wall paper, and far cheaper than hardw r ood. Indeed, it
solves the problem of interior decoration. Get acquainted with this
remarkably fine reproduction of the beautiful, hard, polished timbers. We
can supply in Golden Oak, Weathered Oak, Mahogany or Jenisero. May

iHOW TO USE THE POWDER.,
The Red Page
Chesterton
G. Iv. Chesterton's formula is a simple
one. Either he lets a crowd of lunatics
loose in a sane world or he peoples this
* n atlC asj^um a globe with persons pain-
fully sane, and then sits back and sees what
happens. Either method is the same method,
and the result is a nightmare that follows
the cruel logic of dreams. In The Flying
inn (Methuen, per Sydney Book Club)
(jr.Iv.C. invents a series of impossible absurd-
ities, places therein his supermen, and pro-
c»e , . ucidly to work out. the consequences
of his inconceivable assumptions. Thus
Europe is conquered by the Turk, and Eng-
land is Moslemised. Alcohol is abolished,
partially, by the passing of a law that it
can j e so . 0I l* 1 Premises outside which
stands an inn-sign. Patrick Dalroy believes in
rum for the people; and when the pub of
his friend Humphrey Pump is threatened by
the police, he uproots the inn-sign, and with
the publican, a keg of rum and a large
cheese, flees over England, at first with a
donkey cart and then in a motor, planting
his pub sign and joyously dispensing rum
wherever he gets a chance. Lord Ivywood,
who passed the law, pursues him relent-
lessly ; and the feud between the two fanatics
is ended only after a rebellion, a battle
between the rum-drinkers of old England
and the Moslem troops, the death of Ivywood
a od the madness of Halroy. In between
there are amazing adventures, many songs,
vegetarianism, poets, post-impressionism,
parliamentary sittings, a milk diet, polyg-
afP/’ a plethora of epigrams, outbreaks of
alliteration as bad as this sentence, and
Lady Joan.
• Needless to say there is much good sense
in Chesterton’s vagaries. The greatest of
his discoveries is the vegetarian value of
alcohol.
“If I’m to be a vegetarian why shouldn’t
I drink? Why shouldn’t I have a purely
vegetarian drink? Why shouldn’t I take
vegetables in their highest form? The modest
vegetarians ought obviously to stick to wine
or_ beer, plain vegetarian drinks... .The
drinking of decent fermented liquor is# just
simply the triumph of vegetarianism.”
Another fine thought concerns the oyster.
“What a horrid irony it is that this is
the only one of the lower creatures whom
wo call a Native! We speak of him, and
of him alone, as if lie were a native of the
country. Whereas, indeed, he is an exile in
tne universe. What can be conceived more
pitiful than the eternal frenzy of the im-
potent amphibian? What is more terrible
than the tear of an oyster? Nature herself
has sealed it with the hard seal of eternity.
The creature that man forgets bears against
him a testimony that cannot be forgotten,
h or the tears of widows and captives are
wiped away at last like the tears of chil-
dren. They vanish like the mists of the
morning. But the tear of the oyster is a
pearl.”
Yet there is more than laughter in this
amazing novel. There are passages of pure
mu P a S es of devout seriousness,
lhe adventures are real romance. The
characters of Humphrey Hump, the
chauffeur, and the yokels are genuine robust
growths of English soil. And Patrick Dal-
roy, despite his absurdities, really lives.
How accurately, for instance, is the note of
pathos struck at the close of these gallant
adventures! Dalroy, gone mad, “sat play-
mg, with a pale, reposeful face, with scraps
of stack and weed put before him on a wooden
table. He did not notice them, nor any-
thing else around him ; scarcely even Enid
Wimpole, who attended to all his wants.
“‘He is perfectly'happy,’ she said quietly.
“Joan, with the glow on her dark face,
could not prevent herself from replying,
‘And we are so happy.’
“ ‘Yes,’ said En-id, ‘but his happiness will
last.’ And she wept.”
This work is the most brilliant contribu-
tion in the English language to the N.S.W.
Local Option movement. It is worth a three-
fifths majority to the trade.
Liquor Lyrics
By G. Iv. Chestekton.
But who will write us a riding song
Or a hunting song or a drinking song,
Fit for those that arose and rode
When day and the wine were red?
But bring me a quart of claret out,
And I will write you a clinking song,
A song of war and a song of wine
And a song to wake the dead....
OLD NOAH.
Old Noah he had an ostrich farm and fowls
on the largest scale,
He ate his egg with a ladle in an egg-cup big
as a pail,
And the soup he took was elephant soup and
the fish he took was whale,
But they all were small to the cellar he took
when he set out to sail,
And Noah he often said to his wife when he
sat down to dine,
“I don’t care where the water goes if it
doesn’t get into the wine.”
The cataract of the cliff of Heaven fell blind-
ing off the brink
As if it would wash the stars away as suds
go down a sink,
The seven heavens came roaring down for
the throats of Hell to drink,
And Noah he cocked his eye and said, “It
looks like rain, I think,
The water has drowned the Matterhorn as
deep as a Men dip mine,
But I don’t care where the water goes if it
doesn’t get into the wine.”
But Noah he sinned, and we have sinned;
on tipsy feet we trod,
Till a great big black teetotaller was sent
us for a rod,
And you can’t get wine at a P.S.A., or
chapel, or Eisteddfod,
For the Curse of Water has come again be-
cause of the wrath of God,
And water is on the Bishop’s board and the
Higher Thinker’s shrine,
But I don’t care where the ivater goes if it
doesn’t get into the wine.
THE GROCER.
God made the wicked grocer
For a mystery and a sign,
'That men might shun the awful shops
And go to inns to dine;
Where the bacon’s on the rafter
And the wine is in the wood,
And God that made good laughter
Has seen that they are g00d... .
The righteous minds of innkeepers
Induce them now and then
To crack a bottle with a friend
Or treat unmoneyed men,
But who hath seen the Grocer
Treat housemaids to his teas
Or crack a bottle of fish-sauce
Or stand a man a cheese?. ...
THE ROLLING ENGLISH ROAD.
Before the Roman came to Rye or out to
Severn strode ,
The rolling English drunkard made the roll-
ing English road,
A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles
round the shire,
And after him the parson ran, the sexton
and the squire;
A merry road, a masy road, and such as we
did tread
Ihe night we went to Birmingham by wav
of Beacliy Head.
I knew no harm of Bonaparte and plenty
of the Squire,
And for to fight the Frenchman I did not
much desire;
But I did bash their baggonets because they
came arrayed
To straighten out the crooked road an Eng-
lish drunkard made,
Whan you and I went down the lane with
i ale-mugs in our hands,
Ihe night we went to Glastonbury by way
of Goodwin Sands.
His sins they were forgiven him; or why do
flowers run
Behind him; and the hedges all strength-
in g in the sun?
The wild thing went from left to right and
knew not which teas which,
But the wild rose was above him when they
found him in the ditch.
God pardon us, nor harden us; we did not
see so clear
The night we went to Bannockburn by wav
of Brighton Pier.
My friends, we will not go again or ape an
ancient .rage,
Or stretch the folly of our youth to be the
shame of age,
But walk with clearer eyes and ears this
path that wandereth,
And see undrugged in evening light the
decent inn of death;
For there is good news yet to hear and fine
things to be seen,
Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal
Green.
MIXED DRINKS.
Feast on wine or fast on water,
And your honor shall stand sure,
God Almighty’s son and daughter.
He the valiant, she the pure;
.If an angel out of Heaven
Bring you other things to drink,
Thank him for his kind intentions,
Go and pour them down the sink. ...
Tea, although an Oriental,
Is a gentleman at least;
Cocoa is a cad and coward.
Cocoa is a vulgar beast.
Cocoa is a dull, disloyal,
Lying, crawling cad and clown,
And may very well be grateful
To the fool that takes him down.
As for all the windy waters,
They were rained like tempests down
When good drink has been dishonored
By the tipplers of the town;
When red wine had brought red ruin
And the death-dance of our times,
Heaven sent us Soda Water
As a torment for our crimes.
From The Flying Inn (Methuen, per
Sydney Book Club).
An American, chatting with Kipling re-
cently, asked, “Where is Mulvaney?” The
Evening Post (N.Y.) explains:—
Tber e was no hint of flippancy in Kipling’s reply.
When he said, “Mulvaney is dead—l think,” he looked
away from his guest, over the yews -and the sanded
walks of his garden and into the glowing sunset, and
there was a little silence after he spoke.
es > " sa "to the best of my knowledge—-
the best of my memory, I might say, Mulvaney is
dead. The last Rental p.icture I had of him was on
the edge of a cut in India, where he was directing a
gang of coolies building a railroad extension. There
is no doubt that he was a bit seedv and down-at-
heel. So I am sure that if he has not already passed
away, he soon will, and Dinah Shadd will bury him
No, he cannot come back,” he went on, after a
few seconds pause. “It wtrn’t do, you know. A
character is born in your thought, and grows and is
and takes on virtues and vices, and
becomes old, and then—well, just fades away, I take
“And that is the way with Mulvaney. I'couldn’t
revive him—l could only galvanise him. He would
he a stuffed figure with straw for bowels, and glass
balls for eyes, and the people could see the strings I
pulled him with. No, he is gone.”
Our Brown British Subject
H. Fielding-Hall, author of The Soul of a
People , is a writer always with something
to say. in The Passing of Empire (Hurst
and Blackett, per Dyinock’s Library), he
dispassionately diagnoses the causes of the
discontent in India, a discontent which he
says, “has not passed, nor will it, nor can
it pass....It is universal, in all provinces,
in all classes, directed not against this act
or that act, but against the Government as a
whole.” A few white pei-sons have been sit-
ting on India’s chest for a considerable time,
and now they have been politely asked to get
off. No persons could have sac on India’s chest
unless India had given them at least a tacit
permission to occupy that unpleasant seat;
and now India has given the occupants notice
to quit.
“The whole system of the government of
India, down to the last detail, is alien, is
exotic. It could not by any possibility be
x’ooted in India. Neither the whole nor any
part could be taken over as a going concern
by any self-government India might develop.
It was created by, and is adapted to, the
genius of the English in India governing
from above, and to that need only.” And
that government was rendered endurable only
by the fact that the British official was, on
the whole, rather a decent and business-like
chap. But conditions have changed, and this
exotic government has petrified the laws relat-
ing to marriage and divorce, and destroyed
the only governmental institution it found in
India, the village community. The British
are unable to frame new laws, because there
is no articulate public opinion in India.
“By our system of Civil Law and Civil
Courts, of precedent and case-law, we have
petrified the bo. js in which India lay when
we arrived and made them far more rigid
than before. While by our introduction of
new ideas and of greater material progress
we have rendered the old laws more
and more obsolete, we have at the
same time stopped all evolution of
these laws, and killed any capacity
they had for accommodating themselves to
change.” But the destruction of the com-
munal life of the village, by the Government
turning the village officials into Government
officials, responsible to the Government and
not to the village, is the greatest error of th
British. “There is now absolutely no organ
ism a man can belong to. There ar
350,000,000 individuals in India, and that i
all All organised life is dead. .. .The vil
lage organisation.. .was the one germ of cor
porate life that could have been encouragec
into a larger growth. It has been killed.’
Thus the unrest in India is a legitimate
unrest, based on very real grievances. Ii
the criticism that the Indian Governmen
gets from England, the author says there are
only two parties. One says, “Sit tight on
the safety- valve and shoot anyone who comes
near you” ; and the other says, “Give govern
ment to the people.” But there is no organ
ised Indian people as yet to give it to, nor
any present means of finding out what brand
of government India wants. The only hope
of the renaissance of India is her gradua
education to self-government, by means of
the villa ire communities, the germ-cell of al
future progress. The author appeals to
Britain to aid India on her way to freedom,
to make her “a daughter, not a subject.”
But not even the most benevolent Briton
can make her anything but a brown daughter,
the bad girl of the Imperial family. The
problem of this brown female is impossible
of solution.

R. A. Scott-James subjects The Influence
of the Press (Partridge, per Dymock’s Lib-
rary) to an expert and brilliant analysis.
His aim is not to gossip about journalists,
nor to describe the manufacture of a news-
paper, but to examine the function fulfilled
by the Press of all times, and particularly
the part that it plays in modern life. He
has sought his examples solely within the
United States and the United Kingdom;
and an intelligent reading of his work pre-
supposes some detailed knowledge of the
newspapers of these two countries. The
knowing ones of the world, he says, have
learnt that the Press is a manifold engine
for moulding, controlling, reforming, degrad-
ing, cajoling, or coercing the public, whilst
the great public reads its paper as it eats
bread, without a thought of the mighty trick
that is being played upon it. The text of
Scott-James’s work is the London Daily
Mail. In that prodigious birth he sees the
portent of the Press of the future. And of
that future he is not in the least despondent.
The Press with the greatest influence is that
of the fashion journals. “A fashion is started
in Paris, and within a few weeks the ladies
of Detroit, Buen-s Ayres, Calcutta and
Brixton have adopted it. Such is the in-
fluence of the women’s Press that at any
given moment all the ladies all over the world
are thinking of the same sort of hats and
the same sort of gowns, and, if they have
the means, wearing them.” Especially in-
teresting is the author’s information as to
the extent that commercial interests have
encroached upon the British Press. This
book is worth while to every journalist, poli-
tician and honest citizen.
Poetry and Drama, that “live” nalf-
crown quarterly published at 35 Devonshire-
street, Theobalds-road, London, W.C., has
the tired feeling peculiar to editors in criti-
cising current verse. What is interesting
however, is the way out the editor has found
for the critic. The poets of 3914 will be
represented solely by quotation, without com
ment. Instead ©f 30 pages of criticism the
will be- 30 pages of extracts, good or bad
However, the quarterly cannot quite escai
from its job. A chronicler will be hired
discuss certain volumes of importance as in
dications of tendencies or changes. He w
endeavor to carry on from quarter toqiart
a continuous history in small of the poetr ’
of the time.
“One of the most remarkable Corots tha
exists,” says IX Croal Thomson, in the spien
did series of reproductions published in hal -
crown parts by The Studio, “is the super
version of ‘The Bent Tree’ now in th
Gallery at Melbourne. And something coul
be said about the curious hesitancy wifi
which this picture was received when it firs
arrived in that distant land, about the be
ginning of the present century. Now, how
ever, I understand, it is hung with du
honor; but like many of Corot’s pictures,
has had to fight its way into public recogn-
tion in face of some official misunderstam -
ing. The other example of ‘The Bent Tree
is now in the English National Galler\
From the reproduction (in one of the forth
coming parts of this series) our Australia
friends will be able to compare their master
piece with the one in London. In other day
... .1 have often seen those canvases side b
side. I am quite sure, if ever they are found
together again, as of course may happen i
some international exhibition, that the Aus
tralian example will bo found to be rathe
the better picture. Corot very seldom made re
plicas of the details of his compositions, ant
even these two pictures of ‘The Bent Tree
so similar in general arrangement, var;r
greatly both in tone and in color.”
There will be a public—of gentle maiden
ladies and ineffectual youths—for Later
Litanies , by Kathleen Watson (Lothian
Melb., 2s. 6d._). There are four bloodless
stories of sublimated tragedies in this book
and there is much about refined love ant
saintly women and priggish literary men
and it is all done verv delicately and vaguely
and correctly, and it is all very subtle anc
sweet.
Eureka: Freedom's Fight of ’si/ is an at
tempt on the part of the author, 11. S. Ross
(Frazer and .Jenkinson, Melb., Is.) to pre-
sent the Eureka Stockade not as an isolate!
incident, but as part of a Diggers’ Movement
in existence throughout Victoria. It cannot
be positively said that R. S. Ross, editor of
the Socialist, Melb., and ex-editor of
Barrier Truth and Maoriland Worker,
has succeeded; but he has given very full
details of the business, and contrived to make
his narrative dramatic by the incorporation
of the accounts of eye-witnesses and partici-
pants. Eureka, written from the miners’
viewpoint, is to be commended for its vivid-
ness of narrative and its fulness of dramatic
detail.
Entries for the best sonnet on our mixed
March close, addressed to this page, on
April 4.
Of . George Lambert’s portrait of Reid,
exhibited at the Modern Society of Portrait
Painters in London, The Athenaeum ob-
serves : “It is the one trenchant, if rather
ordinary, design in the show. It resembles
some. American poster for a ‘business’ ex-
hibition.” Greid couldn’t fit in anything
smaller than a poster, anyway.
John P. hands us further vegetables: “In
order to refute the ancient and decrepit old
lie that nothing worth a continental is ever
produced in Australia, I submit the four son-
nets on January, signed A. Gore Jones, Nina
Murdoch, Herbert Tracey and C. E. Moore,
printed on ‘Red Page’ (19/2/’l4). I have
read most of the poetry, and alleged poetry,
from Keats to Bella Wheeler Stillfrocks, and
from Shakspeare to Jawbone Neild, and,
being well acquainted with modern verse, I
am convinced that nowhere in the world, out-
side of Australia, could an editor conduct a
sonnet competition and get entries to equal
the four samples on which I now rely. The
genuine, poetic temperament is more preva-
lent in Australia than anywhere in the world
to-day. And the sun is to be thanked for
that delightful state of affairs.”
Since advising some woman to marry
Walter M. Gallichan, the futile author of
the foolish Modern Woman and How to
Manage Her, we find that some woman had
long ago done so to some purpose, since
Mrs. Gallichan is C. Gasquoine Hartley, the
author of The Truth about Woman, one of
the really useful books written by females
upon the female. Also we find that T.
Werner Laurie has the cheek to send out for
review as anew work, without any indica-
tion that it is anew edition, a book nub-
lished, according to the » Literary Year
Book, in 1909.
The latest issues of that magnificent pro-
ject, the Home University Library, include
The Literature of the Old Testament, Un-
employment, and Prehistoric Britain.

“New Rival 1 *
No black powder cartridges have so many strong
points to recommend them as Winchester “New
Rival.” Their uniform shooting qualities are due to
the fact that the shells are made of high-class,
tested materials, and loaded with the best brands
of powder, shot and wadding. The patented
corrugated head, and the solid, gas-tight, fire-
proof base construction used in Winchester
cartridges, coupled with a system o.
loading which gives invariable results, pro-
duces a quality that is unsurpassed.

I am a living witness to the marvellous curative
properties of
VITADATIO
Eighteen years ago I was declared absolutely
incurable by three of the finest physicians in New
Zealand. 1 had suffered for fourteen years from
HYDATIDS
and had tried all the ordinary advertised
medicines, doctors, and herbalists, but without
any permanent benefit, and at last underwent an
operation, but was then pronounced incurable.
I was advised to try VITADATIO, and as a
result of giving this now famous medicine a
consistent trial, was thoroughly cured. My cure
took place seventeen years ago, and I am still in
PERFECT HEALTH
and have introduced this great medicine through-
out the world, and marvellous cures have been
effected by Australia’s Great Remedy in all
countries.

have stood against “BonningTon’S’' of 40 years fame.

THIN WOMEN !
Would You
Like a Well Developed
and Well Proportioned
FIGURE?
ANY WOMAN without full bust development lacks the one essential
that creates a perfect appearance. Lack of proper bust development, hollow
cheeks and “salt-cellars” quickly take from a woman the bloom and fresh-
ness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been your lot in so far
as natural development is concerned, but science has found a way to correct
your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-bosomed, and have
been attenuated all your life, if you suffer from no wasting disease, your
bosom can be fully developed and your weight increased to normal
There are to-day hundreds of women who were once thin, flat-bosomed,
hollow-cheeked and generally scraggly in appearance, and suffering the effects of
anEEmia and defective digestion, who are now for the first time in their lives
healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and enjoying the full vigor of robust
womanhood, as the result of a few weeks under our wonderful
womannooa, DR< FALLIE R E ’S FLESH-FOOD.,
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is beyond question, and its use is
no demand upon the subject’s time. Many cases have gained up to six pounds a week, and an
increase in bust measurement up to eight or ten inches is possible. Flesh-Food offers relief
and development to the thousands of chronically thin women who have despaired of ever possessing
a presentable figure It is a nerve and tissue food-treatment that adds weight and permanent
development to attenuated women. Guarantee given in every case accepted.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Question of Heredity
Priscilla is a simple girl.
Her lips are ripe and red.
Her hair makes some attempt to curl
All over her small head.
There is a magic in her touch.
Her eyes are soft and grey.
The chronic smile she wears is such
I cannot go away.
We sit in twilight in the room,
My arm around her waist.
My peach has such a tender bloom
I revel in the taste.
I feel her breath upon my cheek,
Her fingers in my hair,
And all my soul goes forth to seek
Her love for constant wear.
Priscilla’s mother is a dame
Of round and portly style.
Her double chin may be to blame
For some part of her smile.
She talks her weary world to death,
And some may hold it wrong
In one who seems so short of breath
To have a tongue so long.
But when she greets me at the door
I listen to her woes,
While love upon the second floor
Puts powder on her nose.
I listen to her simple tale,
And answer “no” and “yes,”
For in that shrine behind the veil
Priscilla hastes to dress.
The sweet red blessing of her lips
Is soon my full reward.
The mantelpiece has model ships,
The couch is somewhat hard.
A Bible, very large and black,
Sits in a place of pride—
A chaperone that none should lack
Who seeks to be a bride.
But just above the stiffest chair
One picture on the wall
Reveals a face so dainty fair
It holds my heart in thrall;
The happy eyes appear to laugh,
The lips aye curved for fun—-
Priscilla’s mother’s photograph
When she was twenty-one!
We sit within the twilight room,
And gently round the waist
I grasp my simple rose in bloom
Whose leaves are good to taste;
And still my mind attempts to shun
The thought I cannot smother —
Will my sweet girl at fifty-one
Be something like her mother?
N.s.w.

Paradise Inn.
The day has been grey and my thought
have been fretful;
The rain-wind blows cold on the pulse of
my heart;
The future looks glum and the past is re-
gretful ;
And hope and myself have been drifting
apart.
Whisky is tasteless, all gone is the thrill of
it;
Pipes are as fireless as women and sin;
Life is a job lot, and I’ve had my fill of it —
Oh, for a corner in Paradise Inn.
There I would throw down the load of the
weary,
And order ambrosia marked triple X
For the prophets and loafers and glad-eye-
ing peri
(There’s bound to be some of the glad-eyeing
sex).
I’d fly to a perch on a cask where the bar-
keep
Was serving the drinks in the midst of the
din,
And give them a toast that would hum up
the star-steep :
“Make it a hot night in Paradise Inn!”
And somewhere about then the heavenly
chorus
Would start gaily chanting, “Yip-addy-i-
-ay” :
Or the organ would peal out that rag-hymn
sonorous,
“Father, dear father, beat home with your
pay.”
No caste and no rank —we’d all meet on the
level —
E’en monarchs could pal up with Bill, of
Moleskin;
While parsons would crowd round to shake
with the Devil,
Dropped in for a nightcap at Paradise Inn.
And then when the Boss said, “Now, gents,
time for closing,”
And soared round politely tb wake up the
screwed,
I’d rise once again for the last toast’s pro-
posing :
“Here’s luck to old loves and old friendships
renewed.”
Then someone would come to me, someone
long lost to me
(Oh, voice that could stir like an old vio-
lin),
And I would forget all the sorrow it cost to
me.
Could I but hear it in Paradise Inn.
Out to the starlight we’d take us, and turn-
ing
Move on to the Old Path (we’d find it
again).
Hand held in hand, love, with all the sweet
yearning—
Forgiving, forgetting, the long-ago pain.
From under the trees, whereon stars bloom
forever,
We’d see at the liill-foot the dull crimosin
Of the lights in the windows and know we
would never
Have sorrow nor parting, a-fc Paradise Inn.

WHEN THE OLD KINGS TOSSED UP.
Dear Bulletin, — Twenty-four years ago—-
and 24 years is a very little while in the
record of a nation which is so fond of alleg-
ing that its flag has braved the storms of 10
whole centuries —the British Islands got
through with a public income of £59,000,000
and a public expenditure of £57,000,000. This
year the Bull Kingdom reckons to scrape
over the shoals of insolvency and to dodge the
rock of shortage on a revenue of close on
£196,000,000. Of this sum no less than
£160,000,000 is to be produced by taxation,
for the British Government doesn’t own
railways and waterworks, and its public lands
revenue is hardly a drop in the bucket of
expenditure. Property and income-taxes
yield about £46,000,000. Something like
£27,000,000 is raised by going through the
pockets of ' the dead. This sort of thing
is called “estate duty” or “legacy duty” or
“probate,” or something of the kind, and con-
sists in laying a special tax on the assets of
the deceased because the Government lacked
the courage to take all this money from the
deceased before he was deceased. There is
always a chance that the inheritor may be
a baby, or an orphaned dapper, or a widow,
or somebody else with no vote and no legal
kick. Then Customs yield £35,000,000,
which is considerable for an allegedly Free-
trade country; and Excise and Stamps pan
out for nearly £50,000,000. Excise and Stamps
(including sundries) are among the wonders
of British finance. When the list, covering
many pages, is fully inspected, it appears
that John and Alexander and Patrick,
also David of Wales, can hardly look out of
the house without being subject to inland
revenue exactions. And if they stay inside
the house they are subject to house duty, as
well as to many different varieties of local
rates. (The British poor rate alone runs
in some cases to over 2s. in the £, and a
total local rate of 9s. in the £ is not un-
common.)
The British Government is not in the same
situation as the State Ministry of N.S.W.
It has no supreme or Federal Government to
pay its military and naval and old-age pen-
sion expenditure, and things like that. It
has to struggle with obligations of the
Federal sort _ off its own bat, so to speak.
Old-age pensions have added a very big
item to Bull’s expenditure—something like
£13,000,000 a year. Other recent social
reforms have added about £10,000,000 to the
annual bill. But the fact remains that
Defence—and Voluntary Defence at that, for
Britain professes to be much too enlightened
to make service compulsory, though it makes
payment of military and naval taxes compul-
sory—is the biggest sink down which Bull’s
revenue does its disappearance. A scanty
army, a reserve which is the despair of mili-
tary men, the biggest navy on the seas and
sundries are expected to run away with
nearly £90,000,000 during 1914. There is
certainly some consolation about the biggest
navy on the seas, but the conditions are
peculiar and the consolation is not all it
seems. Britain is something of an agricul-
tural failure these days, and depends so
greatly on imported food that a defeat on the
waters, followed by a blockade of a very
few weeks’ duration, might easily starve it
into submission and make an end of the Em-
pire. It is the only great nation which
lives constantly on the edge of the food preci-
pice. It is driven to recognise that if it
happened to be badly insulted and injured and
outraged a long way off by the third or
fourth biggest naval Power, and it sent suffi-
cient ships to convince that third or fourth
Power of the error of its ways, and the
second biggest naval Power attacked its de-
pleted squadrons while the aforementioned
ships were away—well, the aforementioned
ships might come back to find that there was
no Britain, in a political sense, to come back
to. It is a difficult and costly situation.
* * * *
These are the days of high-priced arma-
ments, Bull’s being the highest-priced of the
lot. They are not unusually big armaments
in proportion to the population, but they are
loaded up with expensive apparatus. In old
days, when every able-bodied man in every
white man’s country was a soldier, and the
ban, or the arri§re-ban, or the herr-ban, or
the fyrd or the insurrection was called out as
a matter of course when a serious crisis
arose, the fighting man walked or rode
cheaply to the scene of action, slew his
enemy economically with an axe or a bow
and arrow, and walked home at a very
moderate cost. When the white man made
his stupendous effort against the Asiatic
invader at Chalons —and so far as concerned
the numbers engaged there was no such
battle again for 1400 years—the allied
Christians were financially broke, and the
Asiatic invader had no money to speak of.
When the Holy League secured the naval
supremacy as against the Mohammedan at
Lepanto, the defeated party had more ships
and more men in its fighting line than the
whole British navy can show to-day, and the
victors were not very much behind. Yet
these parties hadn’t more actual cash
between them than England can raise now
in a single year by its beer and spirit duties.
It isn’t the size of the forces, in proportion
to population, but the price of the tools and
implements that is dragging Europe down.
The increased cost of dying threatens to be
fatal. Wars are much less frequent than
they used to be. A great Power nowadays,
despite all its defence expenditure, has to be
very badly insulted before it will face the
much bigger expense of actual hostilities.
Yet it can’t afford to be taken unawares,
consequently it goes on paying.
* * * *
One explanation is that there are too
many separate States in Europe. If two
big nations such as Britain and Germany, or
a group of nations such as Britain, Ger-
many and Holland, could come together and
be one very big nation, a single defence bill
might serve where two or three bills are now
required. If four nations could unite a bill
and a half might take the place of four. The
saving would obliterate a wonderful amount
of taxation. The first difficulty lies in the
want of a common language. A matter
which does much to keep races in that state
of isolation which leads to misunderstand-
ing, suspicion and hostility is the fact that
if the casual Briton wants to ask the casual
German to have a threepenny beer, he finds
a great barrier of incomprehensibleness
between them. And the ordinary German
toiler doesn’t offer his British brother the
simple, hospitality of a sausage for the same
reason. In fact, they seldom visit each
other’s countries because of the language
problem. And a second difficulty is found
in the circumstance that a pair of great mon-
archies can’t unite, and thus make one army
and navy and war budget do the work of
two, without at least one royal family los-
ing its job. The average king is an eloquent
person if he has a good man to write his
speeches for him ; a strenuous patriot at the
opening of Parliament or the launching of
a new ironclad ; a capable layer of founda-
tion-stones ; a reliable patron of art when
he can find out what it is ; a chronic sympa-
thiser with the widow and the fatherless
when a coal mine has blown up; a gracious
personage at receptions; a tidy wearer of
uniforms; and a person who can hang on to
his horse at reviews. But it would be a
serious matter to ask two emperors to toss
up to decide which would have both thrones
and which would retire on a pension.
Still two or even more sovereigns might
give way under sufficient pressure. Some pre-
liminary work would have to be done while
they were becoming reconciled to the idea.
The first essential would be to select a
common language for the countries which
decided to bury the hatchet and start afresh.
In a league of two States the one whose
language wasn’t selected would have to com-
mence the strenuous teaching of a new
speech. It would be made compulsory in
schools and colleges. After a certain period
of preparation it would be imperative that
all books and newspapers should be printed
in it. It would be employed in official com-
munications and used for Parliamentary
proceedings. As a matter of course the
other country—the one which escaped all
this trouble—would contribute to the cost
of the change. A common Constitution
would be devised, subject to revision by the
joint Parliament, and a common code of civil
and criminal law. There would have to be
a common coinage and table of weights and
measures. The civil services would be over-
hauled and salaries and pensions put on the
same footing. A competent tribunal would
go through the peerages, and fix the order of
precedence according to date of creation. The
Mate Churches would be treated as kindly
and diplomatically as possible, bishops and
such-like being a great deal more cantanker-
ous than statesmen or generals, or
even millionaires, and a great deal
less amenable to reason. Each country
would have to vote a large sum annually dur-
ing the years of preparation to subsidise ex-
clusions of its people to the other country
(or countries if more than two were inter-
ested), so that the nations might become
acquainted. Bureaux would be opened for
j s P ecial encouragement of inter-marriage,
and handsome prizes might be offered for
twins or triplets born of mixed parentage.
An interchange of officers, soldiers, '
civil servants, students, orphans, and,
it possible, preachers would be insti-
tuted as early as possible. The tariffs
would probably have to remain till
the meeting of the new joint Parliament, but
most other matters could be more or less
arranged in advance. And at some stage
m the proceedings, early or late as might be
considered advisable—in short, when the
lime seemed Itipe—the monarchs would
meet amid gorgeous ceremonial, and with,
say, five outside monarchs or presidents to
umpire the proceedings, and toss under the
lJivme blessing for a pair of thrones. If
there were three or more monarchs they
could draw lots. Supposing an important
assenting party was a republic, there might
be a preliminary toss to decide whether
monarchy or republicanism would be the new
order of things. The loser, or losers, would
be appointed to the greatest possible dignity
in the peerage and liberally provided for, and
have first call on the throne should the
winner’s family die out. The proceedings
would close with prayer, after which there
would be a banquet, with the losing king
or principal losing king, in the chair.
* * * #
.. If t h .ree racially, allied nations such as
the British, Germans and Dutch did a
friendly gamble of this sort they might make
an empire that would be practically im-
pregnable, remove a constant terror from
their minds, and save £70,000,000 or more
per annum in defence expenditure. That
amount would go a long way in social re-
rorm. Incidentally, the people of each coun-
try would get access to the literature of the
other, or others. They would acquire a
wider outlook. The cause of brotherhood
would get a stupendous lift. The propa-
ganda of peace would enjoy the boost of
its life, and many other beautiful things
ought to happen. Perhaps the biggest diffi-
culty would lie in the selection of the capi-
ta* —the Canberra—of the new empire. For
that reason, a union of Britain, Germany
and Holland would be the ideal combination,
ihen, to obviate the anger of London and
the fury of Berlin, the Legislature could sit
at the Hague. The Hague isn’t at all like
Canberra ; still it is a good sort of place and
most wonderfully clean.—Yours, etc., Henry
lIORSEGOLLAR.
WHEN THE EAGLES FLED FOR
HOME.
The British Government—the strangely
futile Government which has climbed down
in the face of a mutiny of its own military
officers, just as futile Caesars of old used to
climb down when the Praetorians became un-
pleasant—has lately spoken its mind with
unusual clearness about affairs in the Paci-
fic. The eagles have really left for home,
just as the Roman eagles did when the
centre of empire was in danger, and impos-
sible potentates with names like Anthemius
and Olybrius and Glycerius and Romu-
lus Augustulus tottered around" in an
effort to stay the rot. Certainly the two
cases are not quite parallel. The British
navy is bigger—also more expensive—than
it ever was before. The army—what there
is of it- hasn’t lost its courage like the vain
legions that proved to be gone in the legs
when they wandered in the wake of Oly-
brius and Glycerius. There is still cash
in Bull’s coffers. He hadn’t sunk into
complete moral decay; in fact, his Noncon-
formist conscience is as acute and miserable
as ever, and as much worried about the
Social Evil and the Small Girl. Instead
of piling up the great estates which
ruined Italy he is actually trying at
the eleventh hour to break up some
of the great estates, and restore in
some measure the old race of small pro-
prietors. But to counterbalance this, Britain
is up against a food and importation
problem that even Rome didn’t have
to face. The eagles .' may come back,
but .only when conditions change very
materially. The Pacific has become a Jap-
anese sea, unless the United States cares to
argue the point, and considering its recent
surrender of the White America theory in
face of a veiled Japanese ultimatum it pro-
bably won’t argue the point except when
absolutely driven to do so, and even then
it exclusively in its own interests.
When the eagles left they took some pro-
perty with them which wasn’t quite their
own. In a moment of “loyal” frenzy Maori-
land presented a battleship to the imperial
navy, with a general understanding that it
was to be located in the Pacific, where the
Maorilanders could see it occasionally, and
could feel that it represented some shadow of
local defence. But when the eagles gathered
up their beak and quitted, they took even
that shadow of local defence with them.
Whether the British Admiralty will desire,
later on, to shift Australia’s semblance of
local defence to Bull’s own shores, and will
issue orders bearing on the subject to the
British officer who commands this country’s
baby squadron, is a matter for the future.
In these days Britain can’t afford to take
chances. It is the one Great Power in the
world, and in all history, which could be
starved into surrender by a very short sea-
blockade. Up to about 1840 it could feed
itself, consequently it could take huge risks
and scoff at temporary blockaders. Now it
dare take no chances at all. Its agriculture
has decayed; its population has increased
beyond all precedent; and the importing
habit has got it down. When it is driven
to fight a big marine enemy that enemy will
be playing with loaded dice and tossing Bull
with a double-headed copper. Assume an
annoyance with Germany and the decisive
defeat of the German fleet. The ruins of
that fleet would retire into fortified harbors
where they couldn’t be reached. The great
army would stand behind them, and would
ask Bull, with his absurdly small
army, to come and try another argument on
land. If he didn’t come, a German occupa-
tion of Holland or Belgium or Denmark, or
two of them, or all three of them, might
more than compensate Germany for its
losses, and reduce British prestige most
grievously, and hinder so much British com-
merce that the victor would be more dam-
aged than the vanquished. And on the
other side of the case a decisive defeat of the
British navy—perhaps by reason of a sur-
prise attack or an hour of muddle and aber-
ration on the part of the Government—might
signify the end of the empire. Even if
Germany was shut off by sea it has an almost
sufficient food-supply of its own, and it has
land frontiers over which abundant provi-
sions can be brought, so the Frankfurt
sausage need not fail nor the sauerkraut and
beer be diminished. But Britain is differ-
ently situated. The fact is becoming so
apparent that the symbol of empire has
packed up its carpet-bag and bolted for home,
as in the later Roman days, when Rome
felt that the time was no longer fitted for big
adventures in remote parts. And it has
taken Maoriland’s one big, inflated, bumpti-
ous battleship along with it.
**■*-*
Then, as regards our end of the case:
Australia’s position is also unique in its
way. This country represents the one large
attempt in history to establish a purely
white community south of the line. It is
.Tapheth’s greatest effort at transplantation.
Australia _is the only continent in his-
tory which has had one flag, one
government,. one speech, practically one
race, no invasions, no hereditary aris-
tocracy, no clerical tyranny, and no
public misfortunes worth mentioning. It
is the one known case where a white com-
munity has acquired a stupendous estate —
4OO acres per head —without the cost
.of purchase or conquest. Also, Australia has
less defence of its own than any other area of
its size, and very much less defence than any
other area of its value. It has more foreign
debt than any other community of similar
numbers, which means that it has mighty
little reserve of credit for a great emer-
gency. Incidentally, while every country
has a big prospective enemy at its doors,
Australia stands by itself among the habita-
tions .of the white race in these respects:
(1) its big prospective enemy is alien in
race, language, color, religion and civilisa-
tion, so that conquest would mean oblitera-
tion; (2) its enemy is more than usually
disproportionate in size; (3) its enemy is
more than usually aggravated by reason of
the Australian exclusion laws, yet these laws
are inevitable, seeing that but for them there
would soon be nq Australia, in a white
man’s sense of the term. The heat of the pro-
spective enemy’s aggravation may be guessed
by the imperative fashion in which he served
his writ on the United States over a some-
what similar exclusion policy in California.
Thus Australia at one end of the Empire
occupies a position that has no historical
pai’allel, and Britain does the same at the
other. Australia’s notable features are its
great scarcity of population, its neglect of
immigration, its lack of transcontinental
railways, its very scarce fleet, its unpre-
cedented debt, its alarming optimism, its
reduced naval and military estimates, its
hostile Japanese alliance —and its Father
Bull. Bull walks so warily nowadays in
his avoidance of far-off adventure and his
desire to keep the eagles around London, that
he has refused even to be uncivil in any prac-
tical fashion to a very offensive Mexican
brigand. And as to Japan—well, it is no .
insult to say that treaties and alliances and '
guarantees are only paper, and very combus-
tible paper at that. Britain, though its pub-
lic morality is rather above the average,.
guaranteed Denmark and left it in the lurch ;
guaranteed Turkey, and robbed it; guaran-
teed thq Orange Free State, and. stole it..
Australia itself was an heroic steal from;
Holland. All that is charged against Japan;
is that its word isn’t likely to be l
worth more than that of a British;
Parliament, or a wharf-laborers’ union. Or ai
reconstructed bank, or a Holman Govern-
ment when its borrowing policy comes up, for
review or its solemn pledge to Sneaker
Willis becomes inconvenient. And '.that
ought to be quite sufficient to make this
country take more strenuous measures than
it does for its own defence, especially when
the eagles have so obviously fled for home.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Beef and Debts.
A new proposition is the strike of the
Sydney wharf-lumpers against handling
frozen meat until local meat prices go down.
Certainly meat is dearer than it has been,
and if frozen sheep and cow weren’t ex-
ported the local supply would be bigger, and
the price would be lower. But N.S.W. owes


a fearful heap of public and private debt
abroad, and lias also a multitude of ,absentee
proprietors, whose rents interest • ; and
dividends go abroad. .The foreign debt is
increasing wonderfully under the Holman
Administration, and the absentee tax has
just been abolished, so that the private
absentee may increase wonderfully also. All
the gold, silver and copper produced in
N.S.W. don’t nearly pay its foreign interest
bill, so the State has to export meat and
wheat and boot-leather and sundries to keep
the account square, even though the meat
and wheat may be sold in England for less
than their value here, and even though they
may be wanted here and their departure may
cause local scarcity. New South Wales shows
:a diminishing output of. the metals that
coin is made out of, so it is driven to export
more and more of the food it grows to pacity
its treasured Cohen at the other end of the
■empire. A time may come when it will be
throwing beef on the London market at 4d.
per lb. while the local price is Is. od., be-
cause the blamed old tribute to Bull must
he paid with goods sold to Bull at Bull s
own valuation, or the Ma State will have a
receiver put in. It is the natural and in-
evitable result of the devices whereof
Holman and co. are the most notable ex-
ponents. Mere crude, lumpy proceedings
such as refusing for a day or two or a week
or two or a month or two to drag beef about
on the wharves won’t alter the great problem
that was born of the policy of foreign loan-
mongering, absenteeism, low tariff, much im-
portation, and an absurd deficiency of local
manufactures —and which is being steadily
aggravated by the same old policy. In the
black days of the Irish famine Ireland grew
enough food for everybody, but after a suffi-
ciency of wheat, potatoes, butter, eggs, pig,
chook, etc., had gone to England to pay the
absentee’s rent and interest claims there
hardly anything left for anybody. N.S.W.
is going on the road that Ireland traversed,
but” with this difference, that Ireland had
its absentee forced on it by foreign mis-
government, while N.S.W. —and other Ans-
tralian States in a less degree has delibe-
rately acquired the curse..,
About Coal and Brown.
“Solomon Malaprop” supplies an item: —
John Brown, the well-known coal-owner of New-
castle (N.S.W.), lately disembarked a statement ott
his chest re the alleged damage done to the coal
export trade by strikes.
Strikes are a great institution.
This country has very little water power for a
place of its size, very little timber, and not very
much coal. Coal is irreplaceable capital, and if
anything has happened to prevent Australia dissi-
pating its capital so fast as it might otherwise do,
that thing is a darned good thing. If Japan has
secured some of Australia’s coal-export trade, that
is also a darned good thing. Japan ought to have
the whole export trade.
The selling of coal abroad is the Rake s Progress
over again. It is another version of the story of
Charles Surface “blewing” his inheritance, or the
Jubilee Juggins gambling away his last copper.
Coal is, in the last resort, the material of war as
well as of industry, and the last word will pro-
bably rest with the capable nation which owns the
last ton of this good old fuel. If, when Armaged-
don or some such disturbance comes, the enemy
finds he has sold all his coal to foreign nations, and
bought geishas with the money, it will be bad for
that enemy. If, on the other hand, we have sold
all our coal to foreign nations and bought football
with the money, it will be bad for us.
A great coal export trade may enrich John
Brown and his kind to-day, ■ but it won’t do him
much permanent good, for he will die-and leave all
the coin behind him. Naked and small, Brown
came into the world, and naked and large will
Brown go out. Then the profits will evaporate and
wander away. And John Brown’s Body, regarded
as fuel, woii’t amount to much in the furnace of
an ironclad J —not nearly so much as the coal that
was scattered in foreign parts to make Brown
richer than he had any need to be when he was
alive, and no richer than anybody else when he went
the old well-trodden road, and had a big stone put
above his dust with a statement on it that his dust
lay below.
In a poorly-timbered and poorly-watered and not
too-well-coaled country the export of coal abroad
should be regarded as worse treason than the sell-
ing of military secrets or the plans of fortifications.
Of course, Commerce takes no note of these things.
It has no thought for the morrow. Ideal com-
mercial men were Esau, who sold his coal deposit
for a dish of pottage, and the Prodigal who traded
away all his coke in one heroic jag. The N.S.W.
foreign coal trade is this country’s Esau, its Prodi-
gal and its jag ; and there is no lasting good in the
affair.
I now go forth to organise 16 new coal strikes.
About a Pile of Skulls and the Men AVIio
Would Be Dead Anyhow.
Dear Bulletin, —If the report I have re-
ceived is accurate, Starr Jordan, U.S.
anti-Defenee professor and fanatic, now or
recently in Australia, says 'that “the skulls
of those slain in Napoleon’s campaigns, if
stacked, would make a pile 30 times as high
as the Washington monument.” This, I
think, is hardly feasible or even plausible,
because you can’t stack skulls to the
height of something like three miles without
having fully a square mile of skulls for a
basis. In fact, you want two miles square
of skulls. The necessity for all this basis
arises through the globular, slippery and
dodgy character of the materials. If it was
possible to pile up skulls in single file, so
to speak, Napoleon’s campaigns might have
filled the bill as the bill is made out by
Starr Jordan. But, when you treat the
problem honestly as an engineering proposi-
tion, and make due allowance for skull-roll-
ing, and skuli-polishment, and the slipper-
iness of the bone of the dome of thought,
and the way it bounds when it gets started
on a down-grade, and the way it rebounds,
and the way it leaps, and if you throw in a
very moderate discount for wind pressure,
occasional earth tremors and the undermin-
ing character of heavy rains—well, all the
skulls on earth.wouldn’t make the pyramid
that Professor Starr • Jordan describes.
Furthermore, it is doubtful if all the skulls
that have ever been on earth would make
that wonderful and fanciful pyramid, or
spire, or pinnacle. And in any case (this,
is the point I really wanted to get at, but
I flew off at a tangent somehow), ALL THE
SKULLS OF ALL THESE PEOPLE
WOULD HAVE MADE JUST AS BIG A
PYRAMID OR MONUMENT IF NAPO-
LEON HAD NEVER EXISTED AND
WAR HAD NEVER BEEN INVENTED.
The owners would have died in any case—
of old age, hunger, cancer, diseased kidneys,
hanging, leprosy, pellagra, gout, consump-
tion, rheumatism, hydrophobia, bronchitis,
melancholia, amputation, drowning, burn-
ing, ossification of the heart, drink, thirst,
murder, paralysis, fever, suffocation, loco-
motor ataxia, overwork, nightmare, or ulcers,
or through being bitten or kicked or fallen
upon by wild or tame animals, through
burning, scalds, insanity, and all manner of
other horrors. Napoleon, bad as he was,
didn’t add a skull to the pyramid. The
owners would be dead just the same,
after suffering miseries from ungrateful chil-
dren and indigestion. In fact, but for
Napoleon there would have been more
skulls in the pile, for many of the young
men who were killed in his campaigns would
otherwise have married and reared a large
family of skulls. The Peace Society man’s
pretence that everybody lives for ever unless
killed in battle is hollow. Napoleon was a
great reformer, a great builder, a great
organiser, a great Constitution-maker,. and
a great wrecker of old abuses. Even if he
hurried ° few skulls to their grave he was
cheap at the price. Incidentally, would
Professor Stakr Jordan say something
about the skulls of Poland? That country,
in the latest days of its independence, got
to a degree of liberty which no other Euro-
pean nation ever attained .in modern days.
Not only was military service voluntary, but
the payment of taxes for the support of the
army was voluntary. Furthermore, all other
taxes became voluntary. So the army, the
police and the law courts dissolved, and a
tremendous hunk of peace and inoffensive-
ness descended on the land, and Professor
Starr Jordan, or somebody of his sort, ran
the show. Then the enemy came and took
Poland, which served it right for being so
like Professor Starr Jordan. Of course
the broken Republic put up all manner of
futile insurrections after the annexation,
and many thousands of skulls were gnawed
and polished by dogs and wolves and
foxes and blowflies as a consequence.
But the awakening was too late, and
the peasant hosts which fought with
scythes, and camped round fires of damp
sticks in damp forests, had no hope at all.
As for the Professor Starr Jordan of the
day, he probably left early and made for
some safer locality, or else he adapted him-
self to the new conditions, and was so re-
spectful to the conquerors that they gave him
a job as cow-inspector or door-banger or
something. Possibly they made him stipen-
diary skull-remover. —Yours, etc., Henry

About the Infrequent Surplus of
N.S.W.
When the lamentable Hoyle, who assists
in some capacity or other at the N.S.W.
Treasury, was bringing in his Bill for in-
creasing the income-tax, he took occasion
to scoff at Treasurers who kept the accounts
square, .or a little more than square. “In
the past,” he said, “the acme of statesman-
ship seemed to be attained with the accumu-
lation of a surplus.” It was a foolish sort
of gibe from a man in Hoyle’s 'position or
in Hoyle’s company. The record of pub-
lic accounts in N.S.W., since the beginning
of Responsible Government, is interesting.
The list begins with the year 1856. There
were deficits in 1860, 1861, 1862, 1863, 1864,
1867, 1868, 1870, 1871, 1878, 1879, 1880,
1883, ISB4, 1885, 1886, 1887, 1889, 1890,
1891, 1892, 1893, 1896, 1897, 1902, 1903,
1904, 1909, 1911, 1912, 1913, and, so far as
things have gone, in 1914; which makes 32
shortages in 58 years. As for the 26 sur-
pluses, all of them were made by treating
the proceeds of land sales as revenue, and
but for this shameful and immoral use of
capital as income, there would have been
58 deficits in 58 years. There has been as
much as £2,779,813 of accumulated shortage,
despite the use of land sale money as
revenue, on hand at once, and there is not
much less than that quantity of insolvency
now. The disgraceful Government with
which Hoyle is connected has suspended
even the hollow pretence of transferring a
portion of the land sale revenue to the Pub-
lic Works Fund, and to the Fund which
professes to be used in reduction of the
State debt, and that debt now stands at
something like £112,000,000. It finds it
necessary to increase railway and tramway
fares, and to pile on the biggest and most
sudden heap of new taxes in the State’s
record, in order to keep its balance-sheet
out of the benevolent asylum. Two habits
that N.S.W. has never possessed in any
harmful degree are the habit of having sur-
pluses and the habit of paying off a trifle
of old liabilities out of revenue, rather than
leaving the whole bill to that poor, harassed
little baby, Posterity. A custom of sur-
pluses, or even a flagrant tendency to plain,
ordinary honesty is about the last thing
that Cornstalk Ministries can be charged
with. And the present Government —
though even in the worst times it seems able
to find £4 a day for its former colleague
Nielsen —is the l|ist sort of Administra-
tion which should jeer at national solvency.
Nobody should throw bricks at a complete
stranger.
A Bagman from Bristol.
It is a notable circumstance that Sydney
and Melbourne can grow quite enthusiastic
on the subject of decentralisation when it is
at the other end —not at this end. The
beauty of the thing, when it is wholly at the
other end—-not by any human possibility at
this end —appeals to the two congested cities
as a pound of raw meat appeals to a tortoise-
shell cat. Thus it happened, that a bagman-
missionary from Bristol gained an earnest
hearing the other day when he pointed out
that 7s. 6d. to 15s. per ton might be saved
on Australian exports intended for the west
of England if the goods went straight to his
port instead of everything being sent via
London. By the saving of a mere 150 or 200
miles in land freight, this big economy
would, he said, be effected, and his state-
ment was believed. A similar apostle from
•Hull ’got the loan of an equally good ear
when lie came here recently to tell of the
absurdity and waste of congesting Australian
export trade at London, and to show how
some 10s. a ton might be saved if Australian
goods intended for the North of England
went to the northern point of Hull. These
proposals for saving, good Australian money
by cutting out useless railway distances
in England strike the Tory press here as
eminently reasonable. But when it is pro-
posed to avoid ranch greater waste by cut-
ting out longer and equally needless dis-
tances in Australia the frozen contempt of
the big city papers, which welcomed the bag-
missionary from Bristol and the bag-apostle
from Hull, is worse than anything Scott
met on the road to the Pole. Yet only a few
days ago this wail appeared in Sydney
Telegraph— the most brazen exponent in
N.S.W. of the all-for-Sydney idea —and it is
only one jeremiad among hundreds: —
THE CONGESTED RAILWAYS.
SERIOUS POSITION IN RIVERINA.
Wagga, Friday.-—At a meeting of the Lockhart
Farmers and Settlers’ Association, Mr. R. S. Drum-
mond said that some effort ought to be made to meet
the shortage of trucks trouble. At the present time
there were 600,000 bags of wheat on the railway line
from The Rock to Oaklands, and at the present rate
of removal it would take three years before the last
of it reached SYDNEY. The Government was now talk-
ing of putting on a supertax to make the farmers
loosen or use their land, and yet they could not
convey the present wheat product of the district over
the railways.
Mr. Drummond added that only a few weeks ago,
when he was in SYDNEY, a shipload of Adelaide
chaff was dumped on to the wharf and sold, while
at the same time chaffcutters had their produce hung
up at the country stations, and could not meet the
demand, thus allowing the other States to come in
and take the market. On February 28 he had 82,000
bags of wheat, representing some £40,000 in capital.
If he could have got that wheat to the market then,
the price paid to the farmers would have been con-
siderably enhanced, but as they knew the wheat had
to lie here for months before removal, the price had
to be shortened. The city millers, shippers and
buyers had practically worn themselves out in
endeavoring to get the authorities to make some
effort to get the harvest away. It was positively
ridiculous for the Government to talk of a further
tax to make the people’use the land, when even now
there was no hoDe of them coping with the demand
for transport. There were about 3,600,000 bags of
wheat stacked at stations. One hundred and twenty-
five thousand bags were going each month, and at
that rate it would take eight or nine months to
clear, by which time the harvest would be on them
all again.
It was unanimously decided that the member for
the district, Mr. Ball, be asked to move the
authorities to make more adequate provision to get
the wheat to SYDNEY.
Considering the Closed Ports which might
serve Riverina, but don’t, for lack of means
of communication, it seems that this country
doesn’t want a bagman preacher of Bristol
half so much as it wants a sane and honest
commercial apostle of its own.
The Place that Ought to Be.
Victoria has embarked on the job of making
Portland an up-to-date port. It will spend
£266,000 on the effort. The pier is being
lengthened and stone is being quarried tor
the breakwater. Simultaneously £91,000 is
being “busted” on Warrnambool —which is
nice for W’bool, but suspicious ; because if
Portland is converted into a real port, as
Nature intended, for ocean trampsand liners,
Warrnambool’s harbor, about which Nature
never showed any special intentions, need be
no larger, safer or deeper than at present,
being then a mere subsidiary puddle for
barges and other negligible craft. Meanwhile
the Watt Government has notified that
it regards the counties of Ripon, Villiers,
Normanby, Dundas, Follett, Lowan, Rorung,
Millewa, Weeah and Ivarkarooc, comprising
20,033,280 acres, or more than a third of the
State, as being within the “area of influence”
of Portland —the paddock to which it is the
gate. There is also an area of some
10,000,000 acres to be served by the pro-
jected railway from Heywood (Vic.) to
Mount Gambier (S.A.), which # will come
under the same influence. This is an inter-
esting announcement, but unless it is crys-
talised in a genuinely decentralising railway
policy it won’t amount to a row of pins.
Does the Weary Government, for instance,
propose to instruct the Railway. Commis-
sioners to so revise fares and freights that
Portland must necessarily be the port of the
district nearest to it, and will it arrange its
railway-building policy with the same end in
view? The Bueletin has its doubts. Yet,
unless such an honest decentralising
policy is carried out the quarter-million
about to be spent on Portland will be so
much wasted money —a fraud, a snare and a
mockery. At present the railways wind and
meander so marvellously that places which
are 100 miles nearer as the crow flies to
Portland (the better harbor) than to Mel-
bourne (the worse harbor) are 100 miles
nearer to Melbourne than Portland as the
cattle-truck flies. Incidentally they are 200
miles nearer to Melbourne as the freight
charges fly. The way the bill flies when the
Railway Department sets to work to help
along one place at the expense of another is
marvellous. An affrighted bumble-bee is
nothing to it for zig-zaggedness.
♦
“Binnacle” : The wreck of the French
steamship St. Paul (18 lives lost) on Smith’s
Rock, off Cape Moreton (Q.), on March
26, is another tribute to the lighting of the
Queensland coast. This rock is situated
just outside the limits of compulsory pilot-
age, and, though a well-known danger to
those who have been there before, its position
is often unknown to strangers. The St.
Paul had slowed down when the pilot
steamer came in sight, and was loaf-
ing along and wondering when it would
get an answer to the letter that it
sent to the Corinthians. Then the
ancient Paul struck the still more ancient
Smith, and sank in four minutes. But for
the fact that the crew of the pilot vessel
saw the lights of the St. Paul disappear
before their eyes, 29 lives would have been
lost. As it was, a dash to the scene en-
abled the Llewellyn to pick up 11 of the
struggling crew. The skipper and two pas-
sengers (a lady and a little girl) were
among those lost. The Queensland Marine
Board had moored a buoy to indicate the
dangerous rock by day. Nothing whatever
is done to mark its presence by night,
though if it is necessary to warn shipping in
daytime how much more needful was it to
do so by night? Asa mere fact, at the
time the St. Paul reached the fatal spot
even the daylight buoy had been removed
by a squall or shark or something. It wasn’t
as if the need for marking Smith’s Rock
hadn’t been brought home to the Marine
authorities. A couple of years ago the
8.1. steamer Waipara, outward bound, was,
handed over by the pilot at the pilotage
limits, but during the process of swapping
the command with the master, the Waipara
drifted on to Smith’s Rock. The docking
bill was about £40,000, while the total claim
of the B. I. Cos. against the Bananaland
Government ran into six figures. The litiga-
tion was settled after great expense; and
still an adequate mark was not erected on
Smith’s Rock. Perhaps the foundering of
the French steamer with the loss of 18 lives
may make somebody get a move on. Pro-
bably the simplest device of all would be to
blow up Smith.
The Liberal Caucus —composed of members
of the P.L.P., the W.N.L. and the P.P.—
will soon be balloting for the selection of six
Victorian candidates for the Senate out of-a
motley gathering of 14 names. With two or
three exceptions they are a most unat-
tractive lot. Half a dozen old self-pushers
include that irrepressible busybody, ex-
Mayor Weedon, whilst a number of other
applicants have the negative recommendation
of not being unfavorably known, as yetlfto
the public. Perhaps some of these are

The Builders.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The unseemly wrangles over the building of the
Transcontinental line continue and multiply.
—Unsavory fact.
Behold, I built a fowlhouse in ray yard !
Two months agone the great work was
begun,
And ev’ry eventide I labored bard,
What time my daily office grind was done.
’Tis to my industry a monument,
The fowls, my wife and I are well content.
Indeed, I built a fowlhouse. Gods forbid —
Although I made it, floor and roof and
wall —
That I should boast about this thing I did.
I mention it most modestly ivithal.
Just these two hands, this brain were all I
had.
I built it on my own, and I am glad.
And, as I toiled at eve, my wife would come,
The candle, nails and divers tools to hold;
And when I swore because I hit my thumb
She did not hang the contract up to scold,
Nor move a vote of censure, and maintain
The thing should be pulled down and built
again.
She is my helpmate, both in name and deed ;
Nor does she deem it policy to nag.
And when she saw my wounded finger bleed
She bound it up, most tenderly, with rag.
Thus, for one end, did both of us conspire,
To have a fowlhouse was our joint desire.
And, when I went about my work in town,
No secret vision filled my day with dread
That she would pull the whole contraption
down
And start a building of her own instead.
I knew, indeed, she would take care to leave
Unharmed my handiwork of yester-eve.
You’ll note —if you’re at all intelligent—
Our system was simplicity itself:
We wanted something, that was evident,
To wit, a fowlhouse, perches, and a shelf
For nests. I got some timber, tools and
nails,
And set to work. This method seldom fails.
And when I’d done, and saw it stand com-
plete,
With triumph was I most absurdly filled.
A tiny thing, enclosing ten square feet,
That any deft suburbanite might build—
Yet was my soul with satisfaction seized;
And, on the whole, I think the fowls were
pleased.
Now that my hens are well and snugly
housed,
And given cosy nests in which to lay,
It seems their gratitude has been aroused ;
Our egg supply increases ev’ry day.
And yet, I vow, when I their house designed
No sordid thought of eggs was in my mind.
Maybe I seem a trifle too inclined
To brag about a very simple feat.
Yet strange ideas crowd into my mind
When I sit down to scan my morning
sheet,
And read of other builders who should be
Goliaths in comparison with me.
These mighty undertakings, I’ve no doubt —
Vast railway lines that span a continent,
And other matters that I read about —
Are apt to cause much wordy argument.
Yet I, who calmly built a house for fowls,
Can feel contempt for these unseemly howls.
For, when they move to build, unholy shouts
Go up to Heaven from opponent throats;
The Ins are ever brawling with the Outs ;
And both are scheming sordidly for votes.
They build not as true builders, such as..I,
Who build for love, and scorn the trade they
ply.
Thank God, my wife and I are well content
In doing things to win a modest name
Without the aid of Party Government
And all the meanness of that paltry Game.
Honest endeavor, and some boards and nails,
rride in our work —this method seldom fails.
lam so diffident, I hardly care
To give advice to statesmen eminent,
And yet, on this occasion, shall I dare
To offer them some small encouragement:
Let them forego their wrangles, curses,
howls, , .
And strive to build a little place for fowls.
’Tis sheer presumption, surely, to compare
Myself with statesmen in high honor
decked;
Yet do I feel emboldened to declare
That I am more deserving of respect.
They, by their brawls, a mighty work have
marred ;
I built an honest fowlhouse in my yard.

A DYSPEPTIC’S LIFE SAVED.
SEVERE PAIN AND SICKNESS FOR
MANY YEARS CURED BY A
SIMPLE ANTACID.
NEIGHBORS SAID HE WAS A DYING
MAN.
Chronic indigestion and sickness after food
and severe pains were all quickly cured by
a very simple remedy in the case of Mr. R.
Savigan, 11 Gloucester Street, Barnardtown.
Newport, Mon. In a letter referring to her
husband’s illness, Mrs. Savigan writes: “He
did not know what it was to eat a meal
without it coming back,” which appears to
have been his condition for a considerable
time, until his wife, while reading a ladies’
paper, saw ordinary bisura ted magnesia
recommended for indigestion, and obtained
a small quantity so that her husband might
try it. A few doses gave Mr. Savigan great
relief, and before he had finished the first
supply the trouble was practically cured.
To use Mrs. Savigan’s own words: “He can
eat his food and is looking splendid, and can
do his w:ork; in fact, all the people about
here look at him, for they all said he was a
dying man.” The quantity of bisurated
magnesia that cured Mr. Savigan was half a
teaspoonful in a wineglass of water after
meals, and we strongly advise any of our
readers who suffer from indigestion to try
it. Be careful to get the bisurated form

ducts similarly named do not have the same
beneficial effect.*

The Bulletin sent, not its Religious
Editor, but its Extra-Special Religious
Editor, to look on “Joseph and His Breth-
ren” at Sydney Royal, and when he re-
turned he handed this screech to the Plain,
Ordinary Editor: —
And Jacob dwelt in the land of Canaan. Now,
Israel loved Joseph more than all his children,
because he was the son of his old age; and he
made him a coat of many colors. And Joseph
dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren;
and they hated him yet the more. And when they
saw him afar off, they conspired against him to
slay him. And it came to pass, when Joseph was
come unto his brethren that they stript Joseph out
of his coat-—his coat of many colors that was on
him. And they took him, and cast him into a pit;
and the pit was empty. There was no water in it.
And, behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from
Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm
and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. And
the brethren drew and lifted Joseph out of the
pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces
of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, bought him off
the Ishmaelites. And Joseph found grace in his
sight, and he served him; and he made him over-
seer over his house.
Now, Joseph was a goodly person, and well-
favored. And it came to pass that his master’s wife
east her eyes upon Joseph ; and she said, “Lie with
me.” But Joseph never lied in his life. And she
caught him by his garment; and he left his garment
in her hand, also his belltopper, and fled forth. And
she spake unto Potiphar according to these words,
saying: “The Hebrew servant came to mock me.”
And Joseph’s master boiled over, and took him, and
put him into the prison.
And it came to pass at the end of two full years
that Pharaoh dreamed: and he sent and called for
all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men
thereof; and Pharaoh told them his dream; but
there was none that could interpret it unto Phar-
aoh.. Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and
they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and
he shaved himself, and shampooed his head, and
changed his raiment, and came unto Pharaoh. And
Joseph said unto Pharaoh: “God hath showed
Pharaoh what he is about to do.” And Pharaoh
said unto Joseph: “See, I have set thee over all
the land of Egypt.” And he gave him to wife
Asenath. And the famine waxed sore in the land of
Egypt. And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to
buy in Egypt. And he fell upon his brother
Benjamin s neck, and wept; and Beniamin wept
upon his neck.
It came to pass, from this Book of the Works, a
certain scribe wrote a play, and the play was
enacted before a great company of the Philistines of
Sydney in the arena of the Royal Theatre, it being
the evening of the sixth day. And the Philistines
saw it, and, behold, it wasn’t too horrible. But it
came to pass, also, that here were also gathered
together certain dogs, called by the Philistines
critics. And, behold, one of the dogs was seated
r n n a S ? at , w ' vn t 0 all Egypt as Row 1, Number
o»a. And that seat was a chair in a corner of the
drcle with a lordly view of the players of harps
and shawms, and of the lighting arrangements for
the back-cloth. But he saw not the back-cloth,
only the elbows and feet of certain honest citizens
known as scene-shifters, and of the stage-manager
speaking benedictions to the actor-folk; and he
knew not, nor knoweth to this day, what happened
on two-thirds of the arena.
1 , r . u . mor l had gone abroad throughout the
land that this play was a pageant play, and that it
had been builded up for the greater glory of the
s t a g e -carp en t er and the painter of scenes and the
electrician who had been exalted above all other
stage electricians, because he was well skilled in
the making of lights. But all this was hidden to
the dog that sate in number 59a.
tt came to pass nevertheless, that this dog saw
the temptation of Joseph by Potiphar’s wife, for the
couch of Zuleika was set on the prompt side. And
it was a goodly temptation, as goodly as the tempta-
tion in The Sign of the Cross.” But the dog
offered up praises to the proprietors of the owners
ot the arena m that he had a clear view of the players
of cymbals and trumpets. For, behold, all the
players rose up from their seats to see the temptation
But there was one, the player of the harp, who re-
mained in his seat, refusing to be tempted.
Thereupon the dog took counsel with himself and
said: This play is a play of spectacles. There are
two donkeys and one camel therein, and much goodly

Philistines stepped over him and round him and his

The weather bureau at Sydney Criterion
have issued no new forecast. No change
may be expected till after Easter.
Any Sydneyite who forgets when Easter
happens along is reminded of that occasion
by the fact that Wirth Bros.’ circus always
hits the Ma capital on the anniversary of
the shepherds and sheep of Bethlehem. This
time the circus is larger, better and more
brilliant than ever. It always is, and always
will be. It is to resume business at the old
stand in Prince Alfred Park, where the roar-
ing lion, and the performing boojum, and
the hunted snark will be on view nightly
after Saturday, April 4. Besides the
goommarroommarrool and other strange
creatures there will be almost everything,
and almost everything is something to go on
with.

A weird procession passed The Bulletin
office on Monday last. At the head of it
was a young fellow who looked as though
he belonged to the butchering, or small-goods,
or some other branch of one of the basket-
carrying professions. He bestrode a short, nar-
row black horse of the suburban telegraph boy
, A re M d ~ one of tllose animals which Paterson,
Ogilvie and a thousand others have immor-
talised. It was the type of horse that one
imagines being ridden recklessly down
Monaro mountains—4f only for the reason
that it looked the sort of anaemic, unreliable
steed that is no whit more likely to fall
down and break its neck on a mountain side
than in George-street or in its stable. Be-
hind the horse came four or five dogs,
a herd of small boys, Harry Lauder, and a
couple of hundred young men. Henry sat
pleasantly, enough in a motor-car, wearing
over his right ear an immense flat hat, with
a feather in it. He also wore a sporran,
a haggis, a wee bit cairngorm, brogues,
a brose and other national emblems. A
brief, broad person is Henry, with a large,
meaty head, and a nose like the spout of a
kettle. There was a world of quiet, homely
endearing waggery in the way he carried h'is
enormous pipe in the south-east angle of his
capacious mouth. As his car neared Castle-
reagh-street the crowd in front and behind
it naturally swelled. The show had been
well advertised. By the time Henry and

his absurd hat and preposterous pipe had
got abreast of the Commercial Travellers’
Club the entire cavalcade was impelled to
halt. The usual crowd of casual folks, with
time on their hands, that invariably masses
when there is a fire or a dog-fight or what-
not in progress, blocked the way. The
populace couldn’t have behaved better if the
publicity expert of the Lauder management
had subsidised it. It argued with itself;
cursed the police; blithered about bonnie old
Scotland, .dear old Ireland, good old England
and delightful old Wales with the utmost
enthusiasm. Meanwhile a portion of it
picked the pockets of as many members
of the other portion as weren’t on
the alert to protect such articles of value
as they possessed. And through it all the
pipes skirled or gibbered, or whatever the
right word is; and Harry Lauder talked
stage-Scotch with the industry for which his
race is fa.med. Amidst tremendous uproar,
and reclame and public inconvenience he
and his party ultimately won to the steps
of their hotel. The question arises whether
this reception business isn’t being overdone.

Sydney should be grateful to Hugh Buckler
for his revival of Arnold Bennett’s delight-
ful play, “The Great Adventure.” This
fantastical plot of the great painter, who,
through sheer nervousness, allows his dead
valet to be buried in Westminster Abbey as
the artist, and takes the name and the ob-
scurity of the dead servant, only to find in
his suburban home happiness and the charm-
ing widow, Janet Cannot, is peopled with
people who are quite untheatrical but pleas-
antly alive. After the melodrama of the
modern “powerful” play, this charming bit
of real life comes as a relief. And Hugh
Buckler, in the part of Ilam Carve, has so
matured his conception of the shy artist that
it stands out as his finest impersonation in
Sydney. Hugh Buckler makes the charac-
ter human and lovable by a series of subtle
touches, far removed from theatricalism.
And Miss Violet Paget, though she still fails
quite to suggest the softness of the heart
beneath her matter-of-fact manner, has in
other details, such as her management of the
accent, enriched her characterisation.
The Pyjama Girl (Anna McNab) displays
the new fashion nightie.
To-night (Thursday) the Julius Knight
season closes at Her Majesty’s Theatre, Syd-
ney. Napoleon withdraws. His army is
disbanded. The greatest petitioner in the
history of divorce abandons his case. All
this in order that the J. C. Williamson Co.’s
pantomime or burlesque, as it prefers to be
called, may get thoroughly ready for its first
Sydney appearance on Saturday night. It
has only been running a matter of three
months in Melbourne, and there are fears
lest the artists may be shaky in their lines.
“The Land of Nod” is nearing the end of
its season at the Palace (Sydney), and
before Easter will have moved on to make
way for Allen Doone with his Irish trifles.
Bilanderson sends “The Land of Nod” to
Bendigo for Easter. Bendigo is hauling up
very little gold from a very great depth these
days, and wants something to cheer it up,
especially at Easter.
Important changes are threatened on
Saturday at the National Amphitheatre
(Sydney). On the seventh day which is
kept holy another tribe from the prairies of
San Francisco, New York and Chattanooga
and Chickahominy and Chickabiddv Lick,
and other places where they talk Choctaw
or something, will cut loose. The chief is
Frederick C. Hagan, who, with his sketch
co., will play “The Pool Room.” Two new
sets of dancers are in the bunch — : Carl Bent-
zen and Phyllis Lawton, introducing “The
Maxixe” (which sounds something like a
stuttering upholsterer murdering a chicken),
and the Jakowdew (Polish for Jokook) trio
who are charged with being “whirlwind
Cossack and Siberian dancers.” The Cos-
sacks live a long way from Siberia, and the
title sounds like “the Smiths from Shetland
and Spain.” And there are others, but if
they are exnected to be more entertaining
than the turns Clement May and Josephine
Gassman are doing at present, they’ll have
to shake a wing.
Next Wednesday will be set apart by the
White City (Sydney) management for the
purposes of a fancy-dress carnival, when the
Spanish Toreador from Darlinghurst, the
Swiss Milkmaid from Manly, the French
Pierrot from the ’Loo, and other aged and
threadbare carnival friends will appear for
one night only. Meanwhile, the eternal
tango is going the pace in the show-ground
like Mark Twain’s loaded frog.
To-morrow night “Allah’s Orchard” will
be shoved into the outer darkness of the
back yard of Sydney Adelphi to make room
for “East Lynne.” With the possible excep-
tion of “Joseph and His Brethren,” “East
Lynne” is the only play that reminds this
paper of the. N,S.W. Public Debt. As the
advt. says, “it is full of interest from start
to finish.”
Sydney has got so accustomed to Yankee
and English turns that it was beginning to
suspect that Australians can’t vaudeville
worth a cent. But the Daunton Shaw

them an Australian), who have just opened
at the Tivoli, upset that idea with a

Adelaide Repertory Theatre—though the
first established in Australia, it has just
changed its name from “Literary Theatre,”
so as to fall into line with other bodies —
was ill-advised, perhaps, in choosing Gals-
worthy s “Fugitive” for the brilliant and
crowded start of its new season. An audi-
ence three-fourths feminine, which has not
yet grasped the idea that a Rep. Theatre
may on occasion be no place for young
girls, found this sex-play—its first time in
Australia—a trifle full-blooded. Artistically,
the evening was a success. Clare is that
most hopeless Qf feminine rebels, the almost-
amiable type who won’t “talk it over.” Quite
unable to get on with her excellent husband,
she admits that doubtless this is all her
own fault, and every earnest “Well, what
can we do to make you happier?” she meets
with a maddening “Nothing, thank you.”
Galsworthy doesn’t preach. He doesn’t even
take sides. He just presents a slice of life,
as he sees it. His main point seems to be
that yon cannot leave Sex out of the ques-
tion. The literary Malise lias carelessly
advised Clare to get out of it all, to “keep
her soul alive,” and so presently he finds her
in his rooms, and she is tracked there by
the husband she has deserted. It is advice,
only, that she wants, so far, and his almost-
enforced offer to have her stay there is
declined. But the sequence of events is
logical, and merciless. She cannot support
herself—“ God help all ladies without
money!” as he said once—and in three
months she has to accept his offer. Three
more, and she finds that her presence means
ruin for him with his employer; so she is
the Fugitive, again. Another six, and she is
reduced to picking up a stranger at a supper-
room ; but here her courage—or the author’s
—fails, and she drops poison in her cham-
pagne. “Too fine, and not fine enough,”
was a woman-friend’s summing-up of her
character. Artistic to the end, Galsworthy
lets her die among waiters and strangers.
Fancy the strength of mind of a dramatist
who could resist bringing the husband and
the lover on at that moment! The acting-
all amateur —was restrained and admirable.
Jean Robertson as Clare, Neill as Malise,
Whittle as the husband; with smaller
chances for Dorothy Falconer as a char-
woman, and Arthur Smith as a gay but
gallant youth up against the staggering
fact that the charming girl offering to sell
herself at supper is a “lady,” and has never
been at that kind of supper before.

Adelaide Tivoli continues to score with its
Tango afternoons, and Manager Crawford —
Portus has gone West —cordially invites all
clergymen to drop in and see how slanderous
are the tongues of rumor. Various fur
parades have contained nothing to which a
bishop could object, but there is now a re-
action in favor of underclothing. When an
advt. calls such a feature “darine.” it seems
to ask for trouble, like a bookseller with his
“curious.” The dancing of Reade and Miss
Vivien Talleur continues to be delightful. At
the Dandies’ show, George Taylor and Miss
McQuoin also are giving a tango. The
King’s has a batch of clever new people.
The Rays. . the Carpos, Miss Fay, the
“Greater City” musical four —and so on.
The most striking pictures in sight are at
the Town Hall—Balkan War scenes, mostly
Greek. It is difficult for a camera to get
close to real fighting, but this one has done
its best, and there are some grim Verest-
chagin effects in the scenes with the
wounded. War is Hell, anyway you take
it. So, often, is peace. This show is run
by the Wondergraph Co., which also has its
own two shows, indoor and out, for people
who don’t like war. West’s responds with a
finely-acted “Leah Klesclina.” which gets in
some strong effects not seen in the Tittell
Brune stage-version.

Sentimentalists who yearn for a miserable
evening are advised to visit Melbourne Olym-
pia and gaze upon “Give Us This Day.” It
is guaranteed to wring sobs from a land-
agent. The picture deals with a lone
mother’s sojourn in a noorhouse. and sets
forth, in hideous details, the trials and
sufferings she undergoes till such time as
she is wrenched forth bv her long-lorst boy.


Mischa Elman, Russia’s high-grade fiddler, is due
to step off the Frisco steamer Sonoma at Sydney
towards the end of May. For the Australian tour
(which that bustling citizen, Fred Shipman, will con-
trol) Elman signed his first contract. Being under
age up till then his father used to attach the neces-
sary signatures. First recital: Melbourne Audi-

A very ‘ pardonable melodrama in a pro-
logue and three acts is “Madame X,” adapted
from the French of Alexandre Bisson and
produced at Melbourne Royal. The second
act is weak, and throughout the play the
long arm of improbability is frequently
stretched to its limit to reach a dramatic
situation, but compared with most stage
stories that wade in sadness and end in the
Criminal “Madame X” is worth act-
ing. The acting requirements are severe, as
regards Miss Muriel Starr in the name part.
Her performance, though powerful in its
way, is not quite satisfactory outside of the
prologue. As the degraded woman cherish-
ing a memory of the child she hadn’t seen
for 22 years, her make-up, gait, voice and
general depression are distinctly over the
odds. She avoids a more exacting perform-
ance of the character by making Jacqueline,
a shocking old thing who couldn’t possibly
have got a cheerful young spieler to take
her in tow. Miss Starr overplays the poor
wretch character in a minor key. A per-
formance with a stronger touch of natural
emotion in it is that of an apparently young
actor named Bellbridge, who took the part of
Raymond, credited to A. L. Pearse on the
programme.. Bellbridge’s address to the jury
was finely impassioned, and the scene with
his dying mother could hardly have been
better done. Boyd Irwin cuts a good French
figure as the highly respectable husband, like-
wise Eric Maxon as a virtuous friend of
the family. Both are neatly made up, and
both are. too loud in the first act. Morrison
is convincing enough as the incidental
Laroque. Plumer and Chalmers, sen., sup-
ply the trifling comedy relief. Winter Hall
is an imposing physician, and several other
people serve the drama’s purpose; like the
two first “interior” scenes, which contain
three or four doors apiece.

Taking the three performances together
and averaging their merits the work that
the Repertory Co. put in at Melb. Royal
last week was the best that Gregan
McMahon’s organisation has achieved thus
far. “Rutherford and Son,” which ran
for one night only, is remarkable for
its utter lack of humor, satire or
cynicism. In the home which John
Rutherford, manufacturer of stodgy goods
(unspecified), rules with a rod of brutal
selfishness, there are no sparkling conversa-
tions, bright incidents, pleasant thoughts or
good examples. The people move and talk
and have their being—rather ugly and mis-
shapen beings in most cases—and the gloomy
play proceeds to a natural conclusion. The
one character who drops in casually to fetch
a few laughs is a drunken harridan. Yet
it is a truly gripsome play, of cause and
effect, and all the effects are dramatic. The
tragedy of an unhappy home is free from
ordinary tragic stage happenings. The eight
parts were clearly and fittingly presented—
no square pegs in round holes, or vice versa,
by F. B. Reeve, Ethel Appleton, 11. McMur-
trie, Louie Dunne, Gerald Carr, Lyle
Christian, Elsie Parker and Isabel Handley,
in about that order of merit. Reeve, as the
unlovely Rutherford senior, bore the heavi-
est burden of them all.

“The Doctor’s Dilemma” filled the house
for two performances, whereof the second
attempt was so considerably better than the
first as to suggest that a Repertory co. would
improve two stone —in a turfy way of speak-
ing—if it could be kept going over the same
track every night for a month. The people
in Shaw’s entertaining comedy range from
calm matter-of-fact to frivolous matter of
fiction. The newspaper reporter, incapable
of taking correct notes of anything he hears,
and eager to interview Mrs. Dubedat on
“How It Feels to be a Widow,” is not within
the bounds of reasonable satire, whereas the
four medical men in active practice are only
slight caricatures of solemn truths. In the
two who have retired from practice there
is no exaggeration at all. The young artist
whose small fire of genius has consumed the
whole of his moral sense and burned a big
hole in his left lung, is rather a magnified
portrait than a caricature, and the two
charmers in the case —Mrs. Dubedat and
Minnie Stillwell—are quite normal in-
stances of woman’s aptitude to be deceived
by any soulful young bounder with two
yearning eyes and an opportune cough.
Louis Dubedat is a sentimental bounder who
paints clever pictures. Lyle Christian gave
a very fair idea of what the young man
would be quite like if he were altogether
possible. Gregan McMahon, as the doctor

who hands Louis over to the treatment of a
fashionable physician in order that he may
die from medical causes, was unduly hard
and abrupt in his manner. Miss Hunger-
ford offered graceful suggestions of the
wife who saw nothing preposterous in
Louis’s pretence of superiority to everybody
and everything, save Art —a difficult char-
acter to play, in the emotional scenes, any-
how. Greenwood was a genial, unconscious
caricature of the Court physician who is
already a caricature by Shaw. Helton
Daniell, as Sir Pat Cullen, was easily the
most convincing person in the play; and
McFadzean, Skewes and Miss Allie Robson
did very well. Also Norman Carter did
moderately well as the expensive surgeon,
who removes the superfluous nuciform sac
of every patient who has a sac to lose.
“Come Over Here,” staged at Melbourne
Her Majesty’s on Saturday night in its re-
localised form, is a slightly depressing enter-
tainment. Lacking its dressmaker and its
scene-builder, it would be as naught. There
is no wit or humor in it to speak of, and
very little knockabout fun even of the pan-
tomime order. The topical burlesques—as,
for instance, “Under the Elms, Flemington”
and “The Block, Collins Street” —are merely
interludes for the parade of sundry mum-
mers got up to resemble public iden-
tities. The merit of the show lies in the
scenery, individual turns and specialties, the
bands of expensively-dressed females, and
the elaborate but unthrilling tank and
motor sensations. The girls are even better
painted than the scenery, and they give the
audience every chance to study their artistic
methods by walking tirelessly to and fro
along a plank which bisects the stalls. On
the individual side the revue owes most to
Jack Cannot. Given a congenial part, this
comedian is capable of wringing a smile —•
howsoever wan —from an Arabian Wowser;
notoriously the dourest variety of Wowser
extant. He has a nigger accomplice called
Tobias (Johnny Osborne) who has to work
hard to exorcise his innate gloom. There is
little that is exhilarating about Tobias. Miss
Daisy Jerome, the costly celebrity whose
style leaves no vigor to be desired, sings
several songs in a voice like the beginning
of a riot and in a highly Amurrikan manner.
She will be more of a hit probably when the
crowd gets to know her better. She is that
sort of actress. Fred Leslie and Ivy Schil-

Allen Doone’s last nights at the Mel-
bourne Princess’s are being devoted to
“Barry of Ballymore,” the inevitably Irish
drama wherein Doone is stated to be an
artist and Miss Keeley figures in ornate
clothing as the haughty lady who stoops to
be conquered by him. The airs and graces
of a bygone age are not picturesquely pre-
sented by Miss K. and others of the proud
nobility of the harmless little play, but
Doone cheeks the colleen with unaffected
confidence and sings three or four songs of
Hibernian import; so “Barry” will keep the
co. working at a profit until Saturday. Next
week the theatre will be resting for a few
nights, but on Easter Saturday comes Harry
Lauder and his vaudeville, under J. and N.
Tait management.
This week’s programme at Melbourne
Tivoli includes the Two Ragtime Bobs and
sundry other people who were not there a
week ago, and who will be mostly displaced
by the new arrivals promised for Easter.
At Melbourne King’s the sustained de-
mand for “On Our Selection” accounts for
the postponement of “What Happened to
Mary” until Saturday (11th). Meanwhile
there is Good Friday and its Buns to be
considered. On that annual Hot Cross occa-
sion Walter Kirby will run a concert at the

MADAME X.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The faithless wife of Floriot, like Lady
Isdbcl
Who bolted with a lover from East Lynne,
Got word that Little Willie had been feeling
far from well
(Little “Will” was little Raymond, we had
better pause to tell),
And she came to ask forgiveness for her sin.
She grovelled to the father of the darling
who lay sick;
She wanted to be wifey once again.
She might as well have pleaded to a kerb-
stone or a brick,
He heeded not her passion nor her pain—
She dropped her tears around him all in vain,
So Jacqueline, poor outcast! went and traded
on her sex,
And the next time Hubby met her she was
poor old “Madame X.”
A faded sight was Jacqueline when twenty
years had fled;
A dull, untidy woman with a past,
A druggy, drinky creature, somewhat
muddled in her head,
Who walked across the room as though her
legs were made of lead,
And croaked as though each moment were
her last.
The partner of her absinthes was a certain
Paul Laroque;
A year or two in chokee he had done,
And it happened, rather oddly, that the flash,
blackmailing bloke
Was meditating mischief to her Son:
So she killed the shoddy blackguard with a
gun,
And when she was arrested she refused to
tell the ’tecs
Her name, or why she did it. She was
silent Madame X.
On a. charge of wilful murder she was seated
in the dock —
The Court and its procedure being French.
And lo! her grey-haired Hubby—Oh, it gave
her such a shock
To think that he should see her in an eight-
eenpenny frock —
Sat next the learned judges on the bench.
Her son, the grown-up Raymond, was her
legal advocate,
Though he didn’t know his mater from a
crow,
And the mental agitation of the prisoner
was great,
On hearing he was Raymond Floriot.
She screamed in shrilly token of her woe;
Of all the screams that women ever uttered
through their necks
The loudest one on record was the shriek of
Madame X.
Young Raymond shook the jury with his
eloquent appeal
For mercy for the woman ere she spoke.
Anon the spirit prompted her to truthfully
reveal
Her reason, which she hitherto had striven
to conceal,
For lodging fatal bullets in the Bloke.
The jury found “Not Guilty” and the pris-
oner was free:
Then Raymond learned her story from his
Dad,
And when he called her “Mother” in a tone
of ecstasy
Tt seemed, to make the amphitheatre glad,
But Oh, it made poor Mother feel so bad.
Her head dropped on her shoulder as she
handed in her checks,
And the deadest thing in drama was the
corpse of Madame X.

AT POVERTY POINT.
The conspicuous success which has followed the
cinopicture, “London, Day and Night,” since it
was screened in Queensland, goes to show that other
Australian producers might take a leaf out of
Charles MacMalion’s book of plans, and go abroad
and photograph what their country men and women
would like to see. As it is, these managers are
mostly content to take what a perfect and un-
sympathetic stranger sends along, "With the remark
that they’ve got to take it, anyhow, or that they
can take it or lump it. Sometimes the stranger
adds: “Goldarn ’em.” MacMahon “took” this
“London, Day and Night,” himself, and his enter-
prise and judgment are now paying handsomely.
The picture is running its third week at the
Majestic, Melbourne.
“Stargazer”: “Joseph and His Brethren” have
migrated from Melbourne, and there are local com-
plaints from antiquarians, Egyptologists, Assyriolo-
gists, Babyloniaologists, Sodom-and-Gomorrahites
and other burrowers in the dust of ages. I am
grateful to the drama for the light it has thrown
on a peculiar Hebrew custom. The Children of
Israel in the play do not throw their palms up, and
gesticulate in the manner peculiar to the Jew of
our day. This Hebraic mannerism is of comparatively
modern origin. I learn from my friend, Rabbi
Galilee, that it arose in Jerusalem, and was simply
an effort to keep off the mosquitoes which arose
from the pool of Hezekiah.
“S.S.”: The Firm is calling “The Forty Thieves”
a burlesque for Sydney, whereas in Melbourne it was
dubbed a pantomime. I don’t think it is a true bur-
lesque, but after studying one ballet and sundry
ladies I would advise calling it a take-off.
The Bulletin’s dramatic critic in Adelaide
writes: The last generation seems to have had a
sporting idea of fire-risks in theatres. The re-
building of the Royal (last reconstructed in 1878)
has brought to light all kinds of stuff that was fair
flame-food. The old idea seems to have been to
put up a framework of timber, line it with match-
board, and pad that with hessian. Out of the dome
have come down hundreds of cartloads of inflammable
material, just under which was hung the great
chandelier that —all the years before electricity came
in—gave out so intense a heat. Dress-circle Ade-
laide knew that it got to and from its seats by a
wooden staircase, passing above a liquor-bar, but
it did not know what a bonfire it was going, to
have a front seat in if anything went wrong. How-
ever, nothing did. Herbert Myers —local manager
for the Williamson Co. —points with pride to the
vast quantities of marble stairs, and steel beams, and
fibrous-plaster ornamentation that are to minimise
risk in the new building. The old Academy of
Music, dating from about the same time as the
Royal, was burnt down twice in the ’Bo’s; and then
they got tired of rebuilding it.
“0.K.”: Some of the satire in “The Doctor’s
Dilemma” (now showing in Melbourne) strikes one
as being accidental, or unconscious. For instance,
when the Doctor, in the last act, admires a picture
by the late Louis Dubedat as the work of a “clever
brute!” the artist’s illusioned widow declares her
love and gratitude for brutes, and rejoices in the
thought that Louis -had “a sort of beauty and affec-
tionateness which only animals have.” Then she
goes on to compare the callousness of this calculating
medical scientist with the love of brutes that some
of his rival practitioners display. The animals in
Sir Ralph’s house are “like spoiled children.” Sur-
geon Walpole’s wife “has to tell the gardener not
to kill wasps when Mr. Walpole is looking.” Mrs.
Dubedat’s ecstatics re the “souls of dogs” and
the life of insects seem to be not intended for
Shawian satire on the cant of humanitarianism.
But the dialogue does satirise sentimental humanitar-
ianism, all the same. Dawg-loving and wasp-respect-
ing humans are as practically callous as everybody
else where the feeding of their brutal stummicks is
concerned. Mrs. Dubedat and the other barrackers
for brute creation are like the shepherd who loves
his flock and dines off dead sheep. They are the
tender-hearted humanitarians who devour mutton,
beef, pork, poultry and fish, who sprinkle salt on the
slugs that threaten the young lettuce, and then wait
for the lettuce to have a heart ere they cut it for
salad purposes. The difference between the man
who goes out of his way to avoid treading on a
caterpillar and the bloke who goes out of his way
to squash it is that one is a humane humbug and
the other is an honest utilitarian. But is Shaw’s
comedy intended to cover the same ground of satire
as this cynical paragraph touches upon? Probably
not. He p-ot there in the ordinary course of smart
dialogue writing. All bursts of indignant feeling
—especially womanly feeling, are loaded with uncon-
scious satire on the selfishness of sweet humanity.
“Blastiferous”: Another film fire, in the heart of
Sydney, has thrown more incandescent light upon
the foolishness of permitting such inflammable
material to be stocked in offices and flats in a big
city. The film blaze at the Crystal Palace, which
ought to have destroyed that monument of mistaken
confidence and other property, but only scorched it,
told its own tale. The film supplies there were kept
in a carefully-designed strong room of cement, with
a steel door (which door, on the night of the still
unexplained catastrophe, had been left open). As
soon as the fire got going in the neighborhood of
this “magazine,” as it was called —and the term is
an apt one—the film combustibles went off in a
dazzling blaze, and the noise sounded as if someone
was blowing up the Rock of Ages. Every window
and character in the vicinity was wrecked or shaken.
There were the same symptoms, though in a
minor degree, at the film blaze in Park-street, a few
days ago. The film just gave a loud yelp, and flew
at the sky in a torrent of sparks. There are several
film depfits in Sydney at present. At some of
them the film is piled on shelves, either in tins or
untinned and unprotected. Some regulations made
by parties unknown to me insist on buckets filled
with sand being kept handy for extinguishing film
blazes, but the blaze is so sudden and wild that no
one can get near it. Theoretically a tub of water
ought to be kept near Vesuvius, which is another
case in point.
The Fraser Film Release Co. has branched out
in another direction, and has secured the Aus-
tralian rights of inventor Albert Roberts’; dirigible
airship. A month hence it is expected to get a
move on skyward from Sydney with passengers.
At the Woodville (M.L.) Show the first prize in
the spring-cart section was a five-gallon keg of beer
donated by the Woodville Brewery. And it was won
by the (rival) North Island Brewery. Things could
hardly have been more embarrassing had the stimu-
lant been won by the district’s Arch-Wowser.

About a mixed happening :
The story of a motor-car—and certain persons who
had little to do with it. On a recent afternoon the
vehicle was proceeding briskly along a Melbourne sub-
urban main street, driven and occupied by a casual
youth wearing a new suit and a happy look and a
smell of bright, fresh beer. A loaded lorry came
down a side street with some momentum and two
horses. To avoid a smash the youth jerked the car
round —into a telegraph post—and wrecked it. Also
he destroyed and wholly blithered the post. After
viewing the ruin he boarded a passing tram and
disconnected himself from the matter.
The swift crowd that gathered attracted a disen-
GOLF JARGON.

gaged John Hop, who took stock, while debating
whether to send for the ambulance, the fire brigade
or the blood-hounds. He was still pondering when
a casual stranger joined the crowd and poked his nose
in to see what the fuss was about. Several by-
standers immediately identified him as the driver of
the car. He denied it, but the John decided to lay
a charge of car desertion, or motor abandonment, or
non-payment of alimony, or leaving an infant on the
doorstep, and led him by the ear and the hat to
the lockup. There he assured the sergeant that at
the time of the accident he was working at the local
gasworks, which statement several employees corrob-
orated. Nevertheless, he was kept under arrest for
over an hour, getting wilder and madder all the
time, and he frothed so much at the mouth that the
police station threatened to become uninhabitable.
About the end of the hour it was found that he
couldn’t be lawfully charged with failing to pay up
the maintenance order, and he was ejected, on his own
recognisances, with a warning not to trespass on the
police premises again, and a guarded intimation that
he might be liable for the rent of the cell.
Amid the tumult of these happenings another
stranger came along in a new car, hitched it to the
ruins of the other contraption, and led the thing away
by the hair. As the police had the number they
went in pursuit, and hunted up the car’s owner. They
found that he had left his wheeled chattel at a sub-
urban garage, for overhaul, some days previously, and
knew nothing of any of its subsequent wanderings.
The garage manager was next investigated, and
admitted that the damaged vehicle was on the
premises. It had been removed by some person un-
known during his absence, and returned later on by a
motorist living out that way, he having been tele-
phoned to by some other person, also unknown, and
asked to do the deed of charity.
The verdict is that the whole affair is very much
disconnected ; that any car seems to be anybody’s
property ; that a youth with a bright, fresh smell of
beer about him can’t be found, but will probably
come to a bad end ; that it was a kindly act on the
part of the individual who was rung up by parties
unknown to come and shift the ruins; and that the
wronglv-arrested person who foamed at the mouth in
the cell had better be more circumspect in future,
and not foam on Government property without a dog
license.

“Supner Hound” : In the Industrial Court
last week a leading Sydney restaurateur
was proceeded against for not paying a
waiter £2 a week, the award rate. It was
shown against the house that each waiter
had to pay back os. a week to cover or help
to cover the cost of breakages in the estab-
lishment, whether the crockery was damaged
in the pantry, or by the customers or by the
waiters themselves. The defendant’s reply
was that each waiter was paid £2 per week,
and refunded the ss. from his tips, which
varied from £2 to £6 per week, and averaged
£4. The magistrate refused to recognise this
defence; found that the waiter was really
paid £1 15s. per week, and fined the restaur-
ant nabob £5. As no evidence was offered in
rebuttal of the assessed value of the tips
the inference to be drawn is that the tipping
habit is established firmly. A point made by
the defence was that the bill for breakages
came to £2OO a year, which would seem to
show that each member of the staff was care-
ful to see that he got his ss. worth of smash
per week.
VANITY.
AUNT: “ Deah me! How ugly those distorting mirrors wake one look!”
“0.K.” writes a great truth: —
John Madden, the fairly satisfactory Chief Justice
and admirably suitable temporary Excellency of Vic-
toria, is off to Britain for his health’s sake. Also
he is going in the interests of Australian snobocracy,
it is said. Rumor credits him with a baronetcy to
come. The “Sir” in front of his name is to be
made a family heirloom by right of a “Bart.” placed
after it, and his son, Guy Madden, will (d.v.) in-
herit the blessed title for transmission to another
Madden yet unborn, and so on for as long as the
W i„,t Ou,
Madden except that it sees no just cause why he should
ever be added to the list of hereditary-titled persons,
Moreover, the baronet disease is already established in
this country, and a matter for more immediate con-
sideration is the probability of Australian peers being
presently “created, ” like the universe in Genesis,
unless the Government legislates against the threat-
ened evil, A London weekly is commenting on the
fact that whilst Canada has been thrice honored
by the elevation of a distinguished citizen to the
House of Peers, no Australian notable has acquired
the proud distinction. Gaud mayors are the only
“lords” we have been guilty of thus far, and a
belorded mayor is but a fleeting vanity, anyhow.
Be™
requires him to wear a coronet and robes on occa-
sions when even a baronet has to be content with
the same sort of clothes that his tailor
wears. In short, an Australian peer would be a
satire on the country’s democratic Constitution.
And the duty of every good statesman is to safe-
guard the Constitution from absurdity and the people
from loss of self-respect.
Hereditary titles are, in a measure, destructive
of a people’s self-respect. In one way or other
everybody suffers from the tyranny of Class Distinc-
tion. The tyrant would be immensely strengthened
in this country by the introduction of peerages into
our bureaucracy and plutocracy.
At the same time I have no desire to pose as a
Red Republican or to be a Domain or Yarn. Bank
orator. I have my limitations. It seems to me quite
fair and reasonable that the title of Mr. should be
hereditary—also the title of Mrs. when the matter
can be arranged, which is generally done at the
church or the registrars office, on payment of the
regular fee. I believe that the pride and dignity
of being Smith or Brown, or even Hogg, should be
handed down from bleeding sire to son, so long as
there isn’t an hereditary House of Brown or Hogg
which professes to make laws for me, and so long
as being Smith, or perhaps Jenkins, doesn’t authorise
anybody to be superior, toplofty and unpleasant. As
to hereditary dukes, why shouldn’t anybody be an
hereditary duke, provided everybody is an hereditary
duke?
But no social distinction which authorises the son
of his father, or the grandson of his grandfather, or
the nephew of his uncle, to be something extra
merely on account of his birth and descent does a
country any good. A man has a right to be a presi-
dent, dictator, archbishop, general or pilot, if he
shows that he can preside, dictate, archbish., fight
tbe , rack ?• bls f con r te J'
poranes. But he can t transmit his ability to fight,
or preside or archbish.
I have spoken. ’

Wong Ming Chew was allowed, under a
bond of £lOO, in October, ’OB, to stay for
12 months in Australia and “study business
methods.” He proceeded presently to
Burnie (Tas.), called himself Fook Pong,
and, on the strength of papers showing a
Fook Pong to have lived there for nine
years, persuaded the authorities to give him
a permit to temporarily visit China. He
then collected his £lOO, as Chew, and left,
Later he returned, as Fook Pong, and set-
tied down in Melbourne—as he fondly
thought, doubtless, for life. By a horrible
stroke of ill-fortune he. was identified as
Chew. In vain were his efforts to escape
by disowning both his Other aliases and
p oS i ng as A h Quan. The Law sprang
upon him with both feet and a poeae

aboard the s.s.' Aldenham speeding in the
direction of China, home and effluvia. By the
way Chew men tioned casually that he had
1 Anri 7 • i*
been in difficulties over his connection with
a gang of bandits in China, and that he
feared a sudden and horrible death if he
went back there. Not the least unpleasant

MARRIED AND MARRED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A youthful Melbourne parson has been complain-
ing at one of the theological annual gatherings that
a young clergyman loses his popularity after marry-
ing. No matter how great a favorite he may have
found himself in his state of single blessedness, as
soon as he takes to himself a wife he observes a
marked diminution of his flock, and a great cooling
of the general concern in his life and works.
’Tis even thus with Jimmy Smith
Who follows some more humble game.
With Bill the grocerman, or with
The butcher it is just the same,
As with the pastor, finding that
Since marriage he has fallen flat,
And witlcssly has served to block
The single purpose of his flock.
Man’s value in another’s eyes
Is based on what he seems to be,
But women weigh him as a prize
In Hymen’s fearful lottery—
A boon for which the daughters strive,
And one the mothers fain would wive.
But wed you are no longer sought—
Who’ll chase the hare another's caught ?
The teachers say that man and wife
Are ope. It is not so, my son.
You’ll find, observing this our life,
It only is the man who’s won.
And, being won (depressing thought!),
It happens soon that he is nought.
Then hitch the others, reverend gents,
But scratch yourselves for all events.

THE MAKING OF A MAN.
"He said you had destroyed his faith in his
Maker.'”
“ Really, I had only put him out of conceit
with his tailor.”
“Melb” : The Union Club Hotel, corner of
Collins and Market streets, Melbourne, is
sold to the Colonial Mutual Assurance
Society. Upset price at auction last Decern-
ber, £35,000. The Colonial Mutual buys at
a trifle under. This was Fawkner’s first
pitch. He built a wooden house, which he
brought from Launceston, and afterwards
put up a shanty behind, as his printing
office. That shanty was only removed about
1887. The house went in 1850, when the
Shakspeare Tavern was put up there. This
lasted a goodly number of years, and was
replaced by the Union Club Hotel, kept by
Oscar Asche’s father, who came from Gee-
long, and placed Oscar at the Church of
England Grammar School. Nearly opposite
the Union Club, in Collins-street, was the
little Clarendon Hotel, lying far back. This
was replaced by Scott’s. The Melbourne
Club had its first quarters in Collins-street
opposite Scott’s. Then it moved to a square
mansion in a green lawn, opposite Collins-
street Block, where the Bank of Victoria
stands. Batman’s first house was on the
Collins and William streets corner, now occu-
pied by the Australian Mutual Provident.
“0.C.C.” : There is a town called Smithers
in British Columbia. It won’t be long before
there will be towns bearing names like
Bloggs, Tango, Stodge, Tripe and Horse-
collar. And why not? A town by any
name would look as well and have its meat
and other strike just as comfortably (or un-
comfortably) as any euphonious Rouen,
Teheran or Ballarat.

At the bread-baking inquiry in the Arbi-
tration Court last week some of the wit-
nesses advanced the funniest reasons why
loaves must be made during the stilly night.
The president of the Vic. Master Bakers
Asso. stated the managers of large hotels
had threatened to insist on fresh bread being
delivered every morning. He went on to
suggest that hotel orders for bread would be
cancelled if night-baking were abolished. A
baker’s carter naively protested that ‘ ladies
would not be at home to give orders it
bread were delivered in the afternoon.
Another witness thought that “day baking
was impracticable because all the bread had
to be ready by 6.30 a.m. to go to restaurants
and hotels.” The fact that no bread is de-
livered at hotels or private houses from early
morn to dewy eve on one day of the week
seems a sufficient answer to all the babble
about the “impracticability” of substituting
day labor for night labor in trade bakeries.
Under the old system household bread is
staler on Sunday night than it will be when
it is made by Saturday’s broad daylight.
The objections to a change in the order of
bakers’ working hours are as empty as the
hotelkeepers’ threat to insist on the. delivery
of hot rolls with the sunrise. Time was
when everybody insisted on _ having new
bread for Sunday, not to mention new meat
and “fresh” vegetables, but the Law brushed
the cobwebs of ancient custom aside and the
world went on feeding as before.

When is the Weary
Watt Government of Vic-
toria going to pull itself
together and pass an
effective Public Health
Act, and create a Health
Board, or a Supervisor
of Public Cleanliness,
with power and autho-
rity to “deal it out” to
persons whose conduct
calls for dealing out?
The other day the pre-
sent Piece of Timber, in
consequence of personal
experience, investigated
the cases of fish and fruit
emporiums and ice-cream
factories, both of the
stationary and “move-on”
description, and found
many of them anything
but what they ought to
be. There are various
by-laws and regulations
governing these transi-
tory halls of commerce,
but the Plank has no
power to enforce them,
and passes the job on to
the incompetent or un-
willing municipal coun-
cils. But it laboriously
compiled two lengthy
pamphlets addressed to
these councils, pointing
out the disgraceful state
of existing affairs, and
courteously requesting
them to enforce the by-
laws so as to ensure
reasonable cleanliness in
and around public prove-
dores. And the matter
finished in no end of a
silence.

“Mayne Stay” : I fail to agree with the
opinions expressed in The Bulletin
(19/3/T4), re the silting-up of Port Jack-
son near Bradley’s Head, and the dilatoriness
of the British naval authorities in letting
us know about the matter. Whose harbor is it
-—-Britain’s or N.S.W.’s? Is it the Cold Coun-
try’s job or the Cornstalk Country’s to look
after the bottom of the place, and find out
when it is trying to get to the top? As a
matter of fact, the whole outcry in this mat-
ter is, but another manifestation ,of a
degrading eagerness to lean up against J.
Bull in all things. The blameworthy party
is neither Bull nor red-tape, but the Harbor
Trust, the intensely casual body which for
years left the harassed navigator with only
ancient harbor marks, which were mostly un-
recognisable church spires, and invisible, any-
how, as often as not, owing to the smoke of
the bloated metrop. It is bad enough, as I
look at it, to be constantly after J. Bull with
the hat, without expecting the old gentleman
to tell us when our front doorstep needs
cleaning.
“Vic.” (brokenly) : The first Melbourne
Government House is just about to be razed.
It hangs out the dilapidated shingle of its
ruin at Jolimont. Brought from England, in
sections, in 1839, by Governor Latrobe. A
boot factory firm owns it, and wants the
ground for better purposes than the preser-
vation of relics. Bishop Perry lived in a
wooden house near by. Latrobe afterwards
built a little mansion in Latrobe-street.
This became the first Menzies’ Hotel. It is
still a pub. Bishop Perry shifted to Bishops-
court, East Melbourne, where Archbishop
Clarke now resides, though not quite in the
same old candle-box house.

“Vic”: There was a famous bomb outrage
in Melbourne 30 years ago, and the authors
of it are still unknown, which is likely also
to be the case this time, for in Melbourne
most sensational criminals are unknown.
Reynolds and English, carriers, of Queen-
street, received a box. It blew up. English
.blew up. Reynolds almost blew up. Green,
a chemist from the U.S., was tried, but
nothing was proved against him. English
came down again and resumed his carrying
business, but he was never fully repaired.
Green is either alive or dead now —I don’t
know which. I disremember what happened
to Reynolds, but I fancy he married and
lived happily ever afterwards.

ART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The people might find pleasure in something better
than watching one man punch another man’s nose.
—Gerald Strickland, at Minister Carmichael's “art
dinner.”
If Patrick Bradley came to me
And smote me on the nose,
I wouldn’t like the artistry
Of Patrick, I suppose;
And yet I’ve always held the view
That Patrick is an artist, too.
There’s something passionate and grand
To seize an artist’s soul
In William Lang’s extended hand
That strikes its destined goal;
That hand the sculptor’s chisel earns
Through flattening Mr. Noah Burns.
The prostrate form of David Smith,
With limbs all sprawled apart,
Upon my word is kin and kith
To everything in art;
For art likes anything intense,
And David’s fall was just immense.
And Jeremiah, named Jerome,
A splendid sight is he;
A picture from our ancient home
In the ancestral tree.
He’s more artistic —mountains more—
Than any tinselled Governor.
I think if I were asked to say
The worst of all the crimes
Done against' art on any day
In new or olden times,
My answer would be far from slow:
“Official pomp and formal show.”
I love the sight of Bert M‘Coy,
That statue carved in pink ;
But God help him who taketh joy
To gape and eat and drink
When to a Lord Mayor’s banquet sent,
Or asked to open Parliament.
For there is Art in every scrap;
Murder and lust and mirth ;
But never in the verbal pap
Of Men of Solid Worth:
With these, Sir Gerald Strickland—stay:
My ticket’s to ltushcutter’s Bay.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Whenever they met, he usually took her somewhere for dinner. He was a great man for eating. They
usually had stew, to which dish he was very partial. —Evidence in a breach-of -promise case.
Woo me no more with Irish stew,
Nor yet with pounds of steak;
The hours of love are all too few j
Between meals fond hearts break.
Ere we, dear heart, must say adieu,
Woo me no more with Irish stew!
Woo me no more with Irish stew
In Passion’s wildest mood,
It always looks like lakes of glue
With junks of meat imbued.
Ah, Love! if Love indeed be true,
Woo me no more with Irish stew.
Woo me no more ivith Irish stew,
Or woo me not at all.
Find me some dish that’s firm and new
In which no flies can fall.
Ah, hear my earnest prayer to you —
Woo me no more with Irish stew!

the meeting of the State Executive.
Council this afternoon, signed a procla-
mation declaring ragwort to be a thistle
through the Shire of Buln Buln.

Apparently Mr, Hunt, the Government
Meteorologist, has been suffering from
overwork during the recent spell of hot
weather, for it has been decided that he
Is to have an assistant. The Common-

yesterday stated that he is inviting
applications from persons eligible to (ill

Mr. J. Marion: Tlicrc would be soft
drinks, peanuts and chewing gum ob-
tainable in the marquee on the ground,
and refreshments and concerts at the
W.C.T.U. tent. The conference, he
said, should insist on maintenance of
the Act—(Applause)—and not only
wanted liquor to be kept out of camps,
but boys to be kept out of adjacent
townships where liquor could he sup-

THE ONE WHO PAYS : “Between the two of
you I'm in for a bad time."
“He died of lassitude, disgust, despair,
drink, shellfish and the fear of death, and
was twice buried. There were 13 people at
his funeral.” —From the latest gruesome
Oscar Wilde obituary.
James Guthrie, heard of last week in
Cootamundra (N.S.W.) Hospital, is said
to be aged 106, and has all the earmarks of
the Oldest Inhabitant, seeing that he is “in-
tellectually vigorous” and "can read with-
out glasses.” Meanwhile the sceptic still
digs among the records of kings, presidents,
nobles, statesmen, scientists, generals, lit-
terateurs, great landowners, great swindlers,
millionaires, Tom Manns, folk who are in-
sured in some reputable life assurance con-
cern—in fact, among the records of good and
bad and indifferent characters, whose ages,
for one reason or another, can be proved,
and who haven’t to be taken on their own
say-so. And never a centenarian does he
find. He seldom even finds an authentic
public man of SO who can read without
glasses.
Capt. Geo. Lambert, a weather-beaten
skipper who for over 30 years has been dodg-
ing the rocks and reefs of the Maoriland
coast in various vessels of the Red Funnel
Fleet, is about to step off the bridge finally.
He entered the service in 1885, through
being in charge of the s.s. Manawatu. which,
with Captain Williams’s entire fleet, was
then taken over by the Union Co. Lambert
was born in London (1849). He went to
Queensland in 1866, and spent thre years
there on a sheep station. Preferring the sea
to jumbuk chasing, he shipped at Sydney
on a sailer for Boston, and, after bucking
round the planet for some years on different
Yankee ships, he managed to capture a
second mate’s certificate. He was on the
ill-fated barque South Esk when it tried,
unsuecessfullv, to go overland at Wellington
Heads (M.L.), May 28. 1874. That was
the only close view he ever got of a real
wreck.
ALE EDDEN,
Ex-Minister of
Alines (N.S.W.).
The Bulletin rarely kills anyone unless
it owes him money; yet on Feb. 19 it
assassinated one Stratford Strettle, of
Dandenong (Vic.), to whom it owed nothing.
It was in connection with the sale of Judge
Hartley Williams’s house at Malvern, and
Tiie Bulletin accused Strettle, who bought
the house, of dying since the deal. Strettle,
junior, replies that at no time during the
past 12 months has his father been anything
approaching a corpse. This, by the way, is
the second time Strettle, senior, has been
murdered. The S. M. Herald killed him
stone dead about nine months ago.
Bankstown, originally known as
Barks Huts and Irishtown, lost its
pioneer and oldest inhabitant when
Michael Ryan died last week, aged
83. He leaves a widow, 10 chil-
dren, 50 grandchildren, 26 great
grandchildren and one great-great
grandchild. His father kept the
first pub on the Liverpool-road —
The Irish Harp—and to it came,
in the early days, most of N.S.W.’s
leading bushrangers.
“U.S.” : Roosevelt’s auto-
biography is to hand. Our people
mostly, call him Rosavelt. It’s a
melancholy work. How thankful
we ought to be if we have no past.
Praise the gods if you are all in
front, like your future and your
watch-chain and your stomach. A
great man ought to die young.
Sometimes he should die younger.
Sometimes he shouldn’t be born at
all. A great many of them aren’t.
Roosevelt’s African hunting expe-
dition was a palpable dodge to keep
in evidence. It failed in spite of
tons of dead meat. Theodore w r as

the juncture of the peace be-
tween Russia and Japan. He was compli-
mented by King Edward, Czar, Kaiser and
Mikado. Now he has to pick up crumbs.

unable to understand English, was noticed in the
water at Circular Quay. —Daily payer.

When the last English mail left Bull’s
country, Jacobs and Son, the giant Dublin
firm of biscuit bakers, had issued a writ
against Bill Dyson, once of Australia, claim-
ing thick damages for alleged libel. The
trouble is rooted in a Daily Herald cartoon
bearing on the firm’s alleged treatment of its
girls. A set of verse, deriding the honor of
the Jacobs clan, for which also Dyson is
responsible, was included among the dele-
terious journalistic material. William hopes
to slay his enemies in the law courts, and
send the dead bodies out in time to serve as
a Christmas present for his friends.
A while ago the once notorious “Skittles,”
a fashionable British courtesan of 50 years
ago, was referred to in a London paper as a
deceased daughter of joy. She did her dash
on the racecourses of the period and was con-
temporary with Mabel Grey and Cora Pearl
(the original Wilkie Cobb of Daudet’s
“Sappho.”), whose photographs were very
prevalent in shady shop windows. Mention
of her death brought the unvenerable “Skit-
tles” back to light, it seems. She is enjoy-
ing a prosperous old age on the proceeds of
her bygone popularity. The wages of sin,
as regards “Skittles,” are very long life.
“Melb” : Where is all our statuary going
to?. The bust of L. L. Smith is to be stuck
up in the Exhibition Gardens. Subscribers
may be grateful to £ £, but it almost seems
a public outrage. Consider the jumble of
our images! Burke and Wills (shuffled
round the corner out of Collins-street), Red-
mond Barry, Burns, Bent (Brighton),
Baronet Clarke, Victoria, Fitzgibbon, the
wrong Gordon, Joan of. Arc, O’Connell and
Ormond. No Flinders, Batman. Fawkner,
Iliginbotham, or even Jacky Tommy Smith,
Melbourne’s Whittington, Seven Times
Mayor. Was he not almost as big as Fitz-
gibbon?
John Darling, of Adelaide, is dead. Heart
disease cut things short during a visit to
Melbourne. His father, who was also John
Darling, has been dead for a number of
years. They were stupendous grain mer-
chants, and there, or thereabouts, the story
ended. The Darlings took some interest in
politics, but mostly as politics bore upon
grain. Darling the First had a very brief
spell of office (about four months) under
Premier Downer in 1885, but he found the
work interfered with business. Darling the
Second could have had office, but didn’t
want it. He was too busy. He leaves be-
hind him Harold Darling, Leonard Darling,
Norman Darling, Gertrude Darling, Grace
Darling, and a married daughter. Incident-
ally he leaves one sister, four brothers (in-
cluding Joseph, the cricketer), and all the
wheat.
Thomas Brown, the St. Ives (N.S.W.)
orchardist, accused (and acquitted) of shoot-
ing Sergeant Hickey, who went to Brown’s
house on May 1, nearly a year ago, to arrest
him, has had an unusual argument with the
law. His record is: (1) Found guilty by
Coroner, (2) first Criminal Court jury dis-
agreed, (3) second jury convicted him, (4)
sentenced to death, (5) sentence commuted
to imprisonment for life, (6) conviction up-
held by Full Court, (7) conviction upset by
High Court, (8) acquitted by third jury,
(9) arrested on release for lunacy. A curi-
ous feature about Brown’s case was that a
witness gave evidence that the fatal pistol
was in Hickey’s hand and not in Brown’s,
which evidence got Brown off. Also he de-
posed that he didn’t attend at the Coroner’s
trial to give evidence, because, firstly, he
was too busy, and, secondly, because a soli-
citor advised him to stay away. Whether
Brown was to swing or not didn’t seem to
concern him, and no affidavit was sworn that
the Gent One had a sleepless night.
“Leges”-—his speech :
John Madden, Chief Justice of Victoria, he of the
wonderful, amazing, curly, whirly and recently-shaved
moustache, which looks, in its absence, like the
forest which George Washington, who couldn’t tell
a lie, cut down with his little axe —John Madden,
already alluded to, will retire after his trip abroad,
lie was a good lawyer, though too voluble; and a
good Chief Justice, though the speeches he delivered
to prisoners were too long. Sometimes half the
sentence had expired before the Chief had finished
telling the convict what an unutterable scoundrel he
was, for he would deliver a 10-year oration, and
then order the convict to do two months, or have
the benefit of the First Offenders Act, or be hanged
by the recognisances till he was dead, and to find one
security in the sum of £lO that he would be of
good behavior until his last meal was digested. It was
Premier Shiels who promoted Madden, to the satisfac-
tion of his familiar opponent Purves, and all the
men of the long robe —except the Judges. Practi-
cally all the latter were dissatisfied, and more or
less in sympathy with Williams, the senior, who
took the unprecedented and unprofessional step of
writing to the Argus in complaint. Madden would
have been a better Chief than either Stawell or
Iliginbotham, but for the social distractions thrust
upon him by his periodical terms as Acting-Governor.
Williams would not have answered. The fact is
Holroyd ought to have been Chief, followed by
a’Beckett.
Talking in the London Referee about
losses of memory, G. R. Sims states that he
recently forgot where he lived. He had just
returned to town from a trip to the seaside,
and when he got into a taxi with his luggage
he couldn’t give the driver his address. But
he had not forgotten his identity. A man
who makes a habit of advertising himself, as
he does, could hardly lose the run of his own
name. He walked to an adjacent telephone
call-box, turned up “Sims” in the telephone
book, and found his address that way. G.R.S.
tells the story apropos to the suggestion that
the alleged cases of complete loss of memory
are mostly fraudulent bids for notoriety.
Police experience of such cases teaches that
memory quickly returns to the persons whose
lapse is not paragraphed in the press.
For the first time Australians fill the
three boss positions on the N.S.W. Railways.
John Harper, just appointed Chief Commis-
sioner, and James Frazer, Assistant Commis-
sioner, both belong to N.S.W. H. Richard-
son, the other Assistant Commissioner, is
a Victorian, but he came to N.S.W. when he
was aged nine, and went to school with
Harper half a century ago.
TREASURER PAYNE, of Solomon's
Government (Tasmania).
A SUGGESTION OF SOLEMN JOY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Wade’s incursion into the field of humor was
eo effective that one was led to hope that he would
seriously consider the question of introducing a touch
of humor into his speeches in future. —S. M. Herald.
Let us consider it seriously,
Let us weigh it heavily,
Let us ponder over it in the night season,
Whether a touch of humor,
A little pinch of the glad thing,
A minor portion of heartsome lightness,
A fragment fraught with the elements of laughter,
A trifle of simple funning-,
A minute spice of well-prepared folly,
Might not be introduced with care
And with decorum
And with sufficient safeguards
Into the flow of our stupendous oratory.
Avaunt, unseemly levity !
We seek not the broad laugh ;
Loud merriment is an abomination;
The ready jest is foolishness
(Also, it is difficult,
And there is risk in letting it off),
But a touch, a semblance of humor,
Were it not worthy serious and weighty deliberation?
Lo, stodge is holy !
The grace of dull words is a gift of the gods !
He who speaketh a light thing shall be abased,
For the laughter may fail,
And, after that, cometh the flatness of an unbuiied
pancake.
Yet surely might a little humor be pleasant,
As a drop of vinegar in a salad dressing,
As a hint of pepper on an oyster,
As a white hair upon the waistcoat of a black cat.
How shall we make the humor,
And who shall prepare us the delectable thing?
Lo, the Sydney Morning Herald,
And the great Liberal party,
These shall toil diligently,
These shall strive mightily,
These shall poke each other in the ribs exceedingly,
And the result shall be the thing desired,
Yea, these shall achieve heavyweight mirth.
Then shall the great Liberal leader,
Even Wade, in his power and glory,
Learn the wonderful words by rote,
And repeat them day and night continually,
At the same time practising suitable gestures
Until the time is ripe;
Then shall the brass bands play,
Then shall the flags be unfurled,
Then shall the right-thinking people be called toge-
ther,
And the matter shall be fully explained,
And the Sydney Morning Herald shall publish a
leader thereon,
And a day of holy fasting shall be proclaimed,
And a chorus shall be engaged to lead the laughter ;
And when all is ready the heavyweight jest shall be
spoken solemnly,
And Fat shall shake his sides even to the bursting
off of many buttons.
And after that the Sydney Morning Herald might
do a little joke on its own account, and explain
the matter carefully to the elect.

And the secret of the whole thing is cash—spot cash.
The co.’s customers pay cash and get their discount
°f 2s-. in the £ (it used to be 2s. 3d., but the Shade
of Higher Costs said 2s. a few years back) ; then
the co. is able to pay cash for its purchases and get
the discount, and, of course, the shareholders benefit
by that as well. But the business began to get
beyond the co., and more capital was got in,
at a stiff premium. It speaks well for
the public’s opinion of the co. that £13,899 was
recently added to the co.’s funds in the shape of
premiums on these new shares. But still the co.
can’t keep pace, and has run itself into debt to the ex-
tent of £36,864 (of which £11,550 is a mortgage).
Nevertheless it pays cash for so much that last half-
year it saved £1873 by way of discounts. As usual,
some of the figures in the last line of
the table have been guessed at, and those
for January to July, 1913, altered since
last post-mortem. Each half-year a certain amount of
the bonus is. unclaimed, and as the exact amount is
not known till six months later, a guess has to be
made. For July, 1913, it was £242 aid for the
previous half-year £431; in the last line it is
assumed that this half-year it will be £325. This
is how the business has been moving:—•

Jan., 1914.. 154.101 49,658 34,568 18.78 „
That looks like a record all round. Profits have been
growing, but costs have joined in the general upward
move, and the expense rate is the highest to date.
So also are the receipts and gross profit on sales. But
when the artificial prosperity wears off, and it is
beginning to do so now, the receipts will drop ; yet
it is extremely doubtful whether expenses can 1 e
correspondingly reduced. The capital of the co. is
£27,783, and it is distributed among 8288 holders—•
the bonus, of course, being the attraction. Since
1891, when the bonus-distribution scheme was in-
augurated, the co. has handed back £251.716 to pur-
chasers, a striking example of what co-operation will
do. Sundry debtors are £10,163, but tnere is little
danger of bad debts, as most of the money is owing
on monthly accounts, on which h 9d. in the £ dis-
count is allowed. The co.’s premises are leasehold,
with a long term to run.

directors “wish the shareholders to consider it as a
return of capital. It is proposed that when this and
(we hope) future bonuses amount to 10s. per share,
the neeessary steps be taken to reduce the capital
accordingly.’’ The capital can stand writing down:
any capital could that can show only an average of
3$ p.c. for 13 years, provided it isn’t invested in
unproductive land whose owners are waiting to sell
and skim off the cream of the unearned increment at
one operation. And there is nothing of that sort
ahead of this co. Its squattage, up over the Queens-
land border, is a leasehold, with 21 years to run;
and, presumably, the most the co. will get, if it is
turned out at the end of that time, will be the
value of the improvements to the incoming tenant
or tenants—which isn’t always their. value to the
outgoing tenant. Woolshed and yards that may be
worth £SOOO to the people with a big area may be
worth only £IOOO to the incoming man with a much
smaller area.
The co.’s trouble was that it was born in 1882,
and bought Bundaleer and Thurulgoona at a price
out of which drought and rabbits soon bit large
pieces. Also, as usual, it had a mortgage on the
premises; and the drought and rabbits before-men-
tioned wouldn’t allow the co. to do much in the way of
shifting the incubus. In 1899 it still had a mortgage of
£60,000. Then it went dead-slow in the matter of
dividends, and to-day it has no mortgage at all, and
its sundry creditors have claims for only £846
while on the other side it has accumulated £19,289
of hard cash, besides having £11,560 (net, esti-
mated) of wool on hand. Compare some other
figures:—
T . 1907. 1913.
Liabilities £44,075 £846
Assets:—
Live stock 79,602 56,300
Plant and stores.. .. 21,420 7 397
Wool 20,289 11,560
Cash, etc 103 19,307
So in six years the reduction' in the liabilities and
the increase in the cash, etc. (practically all cash
and practically no etc.) have together amounted to
£62,433 ; but as against that there has been a
reduction of £23,302 in the book value of the stock
and of £14,023 in that of the plant and stores.
How much of this reduction is due to writing-down
out of undisclosed profits and how much is real
reduction in value The Bulletin doesn’t know. The
runs are certainly carrying less stock now than
TANARUS, s ' x y ears a 5° —107,791 sheep as against
142,939. However, an improvement of £35,000 is
shown m the position apart from what may be due
to the sale of stock and the reduction of plant and
stores. The profits shown in the table in excess of
dividends wouldn’t account for that £35,000 ; but
there have been other large sums that have been
written off station and station improvements:—

Of course some of this money has been absorbed in
other improvements ; but not a very great deal
In mo, for instance, when £10,440* of profit was
Witten off, only £2210 was spent on additions.
Ihe balance (written off against decay or to cover
rand taken by selectors) was available to wipe out
the debt and build up the cash reserves. How the
co. is going to do in the next six years it would
take a very experienced prophet to tell. Nearlv
everything depends on the seasons. But the co in
lacing the job of returning capital and, meanwhile,
paying a div. of some sort, has these two advantages*

Some of the figures in the last line are to a limited
extent based on estimate, the exact amount of ':he
trade bonus for the last quarter of the year being
unknown. The cm was formed by a few Melbourne
publicans whose beer-pumps often ran hot through
tOI A Pricked into action by an increase in
the price of beer, they considered the question of a
co-operative brewery : they knew they could keep a
sizeable brewery going themselves—knew, too, that
it they didn t have to canvass themselves for their
own custom, or splash up their own travellers’ money
on their own counters to secure their own orders, or
chase themselves to collect the money from them-
selves, they ought to be able to supply themselves
at a lower price than anybody else could do it.
This co. was the result. It was quite a little thing
at first; but others soon wanted to come in and get
the benefit of the bonus, and as the monev was
handy for plant additions, etc., further shares were
offered to existing holders at stiff premiums, the
last , lot (ss. fully paid) bringing 30s. The dividend
on most of the 108,326 shares issued is therefore a
lot short of 80 or 90 p.c. ; on the capital and pre-
miums combined—that is, on the amount actually
paid up by shareholders—it averages 24 p.c. for the
past year. Apart from the premiums, fair reserves
have been accumulated: altogether, as shown above,
the reserves are £108,265, of which £71,574 came
in premiums’ leaving £36,691 that has been pro-
vided by the business—a fair but by no means large
lay-by considering the dividends that have been paid.
However, though the co. has been so lavish, it has
managed to keep pace with increased trade require-
ments without incurring much in the way of debt.
This next table shows that and other respects:—
„ ~ , 19 °fi- 1911. 1912. 1913. 1914.
Capital £13,814 £21,588 £21,651 £27,021 £27,082

Cash, etc. 1,242 1,240 2,233 4,598 709
The weakest point in that lot is the growth of the
book debts. Practically there shouldn’t be such
things in a co-operative concern. True, to a great
extent the growth is due to the growth of the
business; and what that has been may be judged by
the fact that exes, not charged to manufacturing
account (that is to say, office and management and
sale exes., freight, repairs, insurance, advertising,
etc.) have hurried along from £13,288 in 1906-7 to
£43,177 in the past year. The success of this con-
cern would unquestionably have badly rattled the
older breweries if the latter hadn’t cut exes, by
forming what is known as the combine and shutting
up superfluous factories. As it is, besides acquiring
some of the old cos/ trade, this co. hadn’t been long
in operation before its big competitors hauled down
the price of beer by ss. per hogshead.

Profits are very erratic, probably because commis-
sions on the. capital value of estates administered
are included in lumps. The practice of trustee cos.
in this matter varies. All the cos. make one charge
of from 1 to 2$ p.c. on the capital value and an
annual charge of usually 2i p.c. on the income.
Some spread the commission on the capital over the
whole period during which it is expected that the
" iU J> e * n h ant h and don’t take any credit
at all lor the part of the commission thus reserved
or deferred. Others credit some of it to a Reserved
Commissions account. Apparently this co. does that;
anyway, it has a Commissions account (£3200) in-
cluded with the reserves shown above. In any case,
though this corpus commission ought to be spread
over the years during which the estate is being oper-
ated, the plan adopted doesn’t matter much so long
as you take a general view of the profits over a
tanly long period, and don’t place much dependence
on any one year’s figures. In this case, the average
is all right, though there ought to be a more distinct
upward movement than there is. Since 1907, for
instance, £6OOO has been added to the reserves, and
from that source alone an extra £3OO or so a year
should be coming in. Yet, though the upward move-
ment lsn ’t at all pronounced, there is still a good
margin of profit over the 10 p.c. div. As for the
security of those reserves, nothing definite can be
said. Capital and reserves, before payment of the
div., were £37,765; and that and a trifle of
are represented by Vic. public stock,
£IO,OOO ; office property, £B9OO ; “loans on mort-
gage and other advances,’’ £19,035; and a few
hundreds in sundries. “Mortgages and other ad-
vances are probably right; they ought to be, a co.
ol this sort being in the way of getting the best.
lor many years this co. had the trustee business of
its district to itself. Now there is another co. in
cne field. Hut there is so much more trustee work
to do than trustee cos. have done hitherto that a
competitor really means another apostle to preach
the benefits of trustee cos. ; hence business shouldn’t
suffer materially.

Perhaps it would be more correct if a “Marine Insur-
ance bund” of £719 was included in those reserves,
thus, bringing them up to £17,068. As it is, they
consist of ordinary reserve fund, £12,000, dividend
equalisation fund, £3OOO and profit and loss balance,
£1349. This paper hasn’t yet discovered the real
need of a dividend equalisation fund. (Some cos.
seem to make it a hobby to collect funds much the
same as some people collect bugs and beetles.) On
its name, the dividend equalisation fund is to draw
on in case the profits can’t stand the strain of a
dividend and the directors haven't the nerve to lower
the rate. If such is the case, it would have exactly
the same effect if the required amount were merely
chipped off reserves. The only purpose it serves is
to make the balance-sheet more complicated. If the
co. does want to drop a few more details into its
accounts, it would do well to carve up this item:
“Sundry creditors, inclusive of bank overdraft and
bills payable current, £49,940.’’ That is still on
the large side, and it gives no idea whatever of how
much the co. owes its bankers. Here is the position
in detaij (more or less) ;

In 1908 the sundry creditors, including overdraft,
amounted to £39,192, of which overdraft was re-
sponsible for £20,426. Still, there is a slight im-
provement in the item. Most of the new capital got
in during the year has gone into stock, with the
result that stock now amounts to £125,097, or only
£2252 less than capital and reserves combined. This
suggests that unless that item is very carefully
watched the shareholders are liable to some day find
themselves with a lot of out-of-date goods on hand.
Book debts, too, are heavy, and the risks of bad
debts must not be overlooked. It seems all through
to be a case where a big accumulation of reserves
is necessary, and the directors would do well to re-
member this should they be tempted to increase the
present dividend.

This co. is in the land-mortgage business, giving its
best eye to the matter of advances for building pur-
poses ; and though a fool and his money could soon be
parted in this as in every other enterprise, with good
management it is a much safer way than most of
earning a more or less honest pound. The trouble
with the building societies which came such a crop-
per in Australia 20 years ago was that they had
lent over-lavishly on inflated values which ended
with a bang too soon after the loans had been made.
Ihe suddenness of the collapse was due to excep-
tional circumstances—not merely the stoppage of
public and private borrowing, but the howl of the
ioreign private depositors for their money, coupled
with the failure of the seasons and a wretched price
for most of our staple products. Other dreadful
things may happen in the future; but, bad as our
public borrowing boom has been, we haven’t been
laying the foundations for a similar disaster to that
ot the early 90 s. Banks and other cos. haven’t for
one thing, been putting themselves at the mercy of
the always-untrustworthy foreign depositor. Prices
have certainly been inflated; but if a good deal of
the inflation has been due to the excessive public
borrowing much of it has also been the result of
phenomenal production and high prices for exports
These two things together mean that, though pro-
perty values may shrink, they won’t generally come
down with a sudden crash; and the longer they take
to ease off the better chance the mortgage no has
to cover itself, especially if it is working on the
i epayment-by-instalments, building-society plan.
Besides its own funds, this co. risks a fair amount
belonging to other people. The following table
shows that and some other details (figures are at
December 31 in every case, and before the annual
appropriations) :

s ! a D? e ly a gamble, with splendid profits when
tne right horse wins, and a bad loss when the brute
runs lame. Last year things were just moderate: the
price of wheat varied but little. This year, on
present appearances, the co., assuming that it got
its supplies early, should do better; for the season
opened with weak prices (largely because of the
bad over-estimate of the harvest in N. S. Wales and
* ’ ai ) d those prices have improved pretty
steadily. This should suit the country miller, who
usually buys early because if he doesn’t the local
wheat is liable to pass him, and then he has to pay
freight back. . The directors of this concern, instead
of paying dividends that dazzle, keep the rate fairly
modest, and hand out the plums in the shape of
share bonuses. Thus in 1909 they carried the capital
from about £18,500 to £30,000 by paying a bonus
equal to 123. 6d. per 20s. share; and now, the
authorised capital having lately been increased to
£60,000, they transfer another £15,000. When
profits are made in big lumps, this policy has the
eftect of keeping the bulk of the money in the
business, where it is badly wanted to finance wheat
purchases, while shareholders get their 6 or 8 p.c.
on the increased capital. Thus 6 p.c. on £45,000
will be equal to nearly 15 p.c. on the £18,500
which is the maximum amount that has come out of
the shareholders’ pockets. As at November 30—just
the end of the season—the co. had £26,115 on its
books and £10,902 in stock, and it owed £7008;
but the figures are probably very different now that
the season’s buying has been done.

Electrical competition is the skeleton that gibbers
most dreadfully in this co.’s cupboard. The revenue
is quite as much as it was, say, 10 years ago; in
fact, a trifle more. But prices have had to come
down ; and as costs decline to follow them, profit
M * to suffer. Also, there is a grave doubt
whether enough is being provided out of revenue to
maintain the value of the works. Anyway, the com-

The improvement in the past six months is, of
course, mainly due to the fact that no dividend at
all was paid last half-year. No doubt during the
five years covered by the comparison a certain amount
has been put into- plant, etc. But the awkward
iact is that, in spite of that expenditure, and in
spite of the absorption of accumulated, savings, pro-
fits have not been maintained. In other words, the
revenue has not been enough to pay the dividend and
make additions to plant sufficient to maintain the
i .I 1 — 0 , of , P rofit - 0n present figures, the old rate
ot dividend is, therefore, out of the question, and
8 pc. seems fairly well up to the co.’s capacity
nowadays.

A competitor has entered the field now, and it is
beginning to have an effect; firstly, this co. is con-
sidering whether it can’t reduce the price of gas;
secondly, it has during the past six months been
making various extensions, in search of customers;
tuirdly, in spite of the extra cost of coal, gas
revenue has shrunk. It remains to be seen whether
Warwick can support two lighting cos. If it can’t,
this co. is in a pretty good position to decide which
is to stay:—

Thus since 1908 the co. has (1) paid for all ex-
tensions as well as renewals and repairs, (2) paid a
regular moderate dividend, and (3) put by £516
a very fair record; still, the dividend being
only 5 p.c., there doesn’t appear to be enough

The sugar mills of Queensland and Fiji, the
mining plants at Broken Hill and Kalgoorlie, and the
timber mills of Southern Tasmania provide a very
severe climatic strain test for power transmission
belting. In all these centres “Pioneer” leather
belting has been found “best by test,” for, with its
perfect gripping and non-slipping—unaffected even
where loads are exceptionally heavy or variable—
“ Pioneer” keeps all pulleys turning at full speed
every minute —it uses every ounce of power gener-
ated. “Pioneer” leather belting is made from the
strong centre cuts of flawless Australian hides, which
are tanned in our own tannery and built up in our
factory with the use of best materials and along
lines that our experience of over 55 years’ belt-
building has taught us is best. “Pioneer” is used
in every up-to-date factory and workshop, where
strength and perfect driving power, with continued
efficiency, are prized. Don’t you want that from
your plant? Let us help you with your power-cost
problem. Send us the length of your belt drives,
and we’ll show you how to ginger up your profits—
we have the time to do it TO-DAY. “Pioneer”

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.
The Austral Otis Eng. Co., Ltd., of Melbourne, are
the sole representatives for them in the Common-
wealth, and will be glad to forward particulars.* [1

Considering that the capital is only £48,080 the
performance in 10 years is very good. The co. sup-
plies electric current as well as gas, and it was in
the electrical part of the undertaking that very much
of the unprovided-for depreciation had occurred.
This plant and the mains have now been written
down to £3553, though they still produced a gross
revenue of £llOB last half-year, and showed a profit
of £375 after paying for repairs and maintenance.
There is £7OOO still owing on debentures, included
with the liabilities shown above. Presumably the
balance of this debt will be steadily paid off, the
surplus profits thus employed being used either to
further write down assets or establish some visible
reserves. That done, the ordinary shareholders should
get a taste more. Till then they ought to be well
content with 7 p.c.

“M.L.”: Nothing has had worse luck than
l’osidonia—the peculiarly Australian marine fibre
which covers some square miles of Spencer’s Gulf.
Textile Fibre Ltd., a Melbourne concern of £120,000,
with a particularly strong directorate, had deposits
reckoned at 2,000,000 tons of clean fibre, worth £lO
a ton. This co. spent a lot of preliminary money in
testing the fibre at Williamstown (Vic.) and in Eng-
land and Germany. But the legal necessity of pub-
lishing the names of the commercial heavyweights on
the Board led to the withdrawal of the prospectus.
It was quite straight and sound, but the law was in
the way, crying loudly for complete disclosure of
everything, and the big men preferred to turn it
down and pocket a loss. A Sydney concern got
some other country in the vicinity, and put the co.
into a fearsome number of shares, which have re-
cently gone begging at a few pence. Even if the
capital had been sufficient, the management was left
to an amateur director. An American co. died before
it could be christened. A Finnish or Danish eo.
was floated, but started with a very bad Australian
State Government and Harbor Trust method of build-
ing the dredge overseas and despatching the crazy
thing on a tour half-way round the world. The
dredge—named the Posidonia for luck —crawled out
to Fremantle, refitted and went to sea again, and
disappeared with all hands. And yet Posidonia Aus-
tralis will probably be exceedingly profitable once
the foolishness of amateur managements and imported
dredges is got over. So far, it has only succeeded
in being a heart-breaking job for the pioneers.
Y Water Tin (Emmaville, N.S.W.) has
paid out £46,000 in dividends, but it has been
Messed with very high prices at a fair extraction of
black tin. For six months to January 31, 235,000
cub. yards were sluiced, and the profit from 1544
tons of black tin was only £6294 gross. So a trifle
over 6d. a cub. yard was earned —a precarious margin.
Wages and costs generally are higher—about £IOOO
higher on the half-year.

Once again the voice of the Pulganbar
Quicksilver and Copper (N.S.W.) is lifted from the
wilderness, with the sound like the braying of an
ass. This show was to have made a mighty splash
as soon as its treatment plant for the production of
mercury was completed. But something went wrong,
and the silence could be heard for miles around.
Now it is announced that the treatment process for
this class of ore is one of the best in existence, and
that, having proved the perfect success of the
altered plant, the co. intends to thoroughly develop
its mine, or mines. As main shafts are to be sunk,
a further outlay of capital looms large. Up
to now, a large sum has been squandered in the
experimental plants. But the latest announcement
may, after all, indicate a glimmer of com-
mon-sense. The Bulletin a year ago admitted that
the accumulated specimens at grass were all right,
but wanted to know whether there was anything left
underground. A lot of people round the Grafton
district were led to believe that the mine was O.K.
Now, apparently, even the directors have doubts.
* * * *
Though the methods of the Grafton
Copper (N.S.W.) couldn’t kill the good little mine
when it was in its vigorous days, a short time back
they bade fair to do so. Alterations and additions
to plant were rung in, but all the while the mine
simply howled for a little money to be put into
development. When there was a possibility of build-
ing up a neat little surplus, the money was with-
held from the mine. But now things must be fairly
desperate, and at last there appears to be a chance
of the threat of development being put into execu-
tion. Of course, it won’t be out of the surplus, for
that disappeared long ago. This paper’s opinion
regarding the Grafton district’s ideas of managing
a mine is quite unpublishable.
Eleanora (Hillgrove, N.S.W.) crushed 849
tons for 3270 z. over the plates and 1340 z. in con-
centrates for £1844, equal to £4 per oz. This is
gross, _ for concentrates are subject to smelters’
returning charges. Ten tons of antimony ore were
also recovered. It is estimated that the battery will
treat 1000 tons per month, so if the return averages
40s. per ton Hillgrove will liven up again. The
hydro-electric plant at the Styx is working well.
The latest crushing reported gave a small profit, but
the stone had apparently been accumulated at the
mine, for the manager mentions that stopes average
38in., worth 1055., and a crushing averaging under
lldwt. doesn’t tally with the rich assays taken
from the stopes.
* * * *
N.S.W. Phosphates Cos., Ltd., starts life
with £17,000, which ought to do a lot of further
development and production. There is a quantity of
stuff worth 77 p.c. tricalcic phosphate, with less than
2 p.c. alumina ; and developments since the co. was
floated have been excellent. The show is only 1J
miles off a trunk railway, and mining costs should be
easy.
* * * *
Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) continues its
blocking-out campaign with varying results. There
has been a slackening in the yield lately. Still, the
total (50 tons 13cwt.') for eight weeks to March 21
is satisfactory. No mention is made of the cash
return, the exes, and the royalty, although that
information should be given. The washaway at
both sluicing plants will restrict the output for
some time to come. The workings from the Allen
shaft are providing good dirt. A block 290 ft. from
the shaft prospects 1001 b. per cub. yard with 6ft.
of washdirt.

To get £5232 from calls and £2200 from
gold in a half-year would frighten most people into
calling a meeting of creditors, but the Duke Ex-
tended (Vic.) still worries on in good heart. The
State helps to keep spirits up by loaning £IOOO on
the plant. Though that sum does not go far, a big
lot of development has been done. Wash panelled
so far has cut up at 19dwt. per square fathom, but
an uneasy feeling exists that the run of wash is
narrow. Four parties of workers are grafting in
the outside ground of the mine, so that if the lead
isn’t draining very fast there will be a reversal
directly the green wash is entered.

One Owen Jones, of Melbourne, has
knocked out the syndicate that has been sitting on
the old Madame Hopkins lease at Homebush (Vic.).
Drysdale Brown will have to make up his mind
whether he likes jumping, because the block won’t
be yielded up without a struggle. As Drysdale
wasn’t above holding a slab of alluvial country in
the past, he won’t have any difficulty in picking
out the quality of those concerned. Still, it won’t
serve anyone to put out Jim Clements if Owen Jones
can’t hand out the cash to open up a good claim.
Nor should Clements have the right to squat if he
doesn’t put up the working capital.
* * * *
Experts are particularly numerous around
Tasmanian Copper, Rosebery (Tas.), at present, for
someone has got an option over that spectacular
show. Rutter Clarke and George Klug are mixed up
in the deal, somehow. Briefly, this is the present
position of the Tasmanian Copper. It has a mine,
a debenture debt of £24,000 odd, no cash, and it
wants a process. Shares issued are 325,000 of £l.
The optionees, if they get shareholders in the mood,
take the debenture debt over, form a co. of 350,000
£1 shares, and put up £75,000 working capital in
cash. Tasmanian Copper shareholders take 162,500
shares fully paid. With shares of the present co. at
Bs. when the option was given, this means giving 2i
for one on the market price. For furnishing £75,000
cash, Klug’s party gets 138,500 shares, because 50,000
of that issue go to reserve. Roughly speaking, apart
from their proportion of debenture debt, they pay
2s. per share over the market price for scrip, as well
as the cost of Klug’s eminent staff. This doesn’t
seem an outrageously soft snap for the new man,
though he may ease things up a bit for himself if
he gathers in the shares of the present co. If he
doesn’t do that, he won’t have any say in the spend-
ing of the £75,000 working capital. The mine has
now to stand the sort of examination George Blake-
more gave to the Hercules as to the quality of the
hot air pumped into its adit.
* * * *
Mount Lyell (Tas.) shows improving re-
turns, but the average can’t get much above 2 p.c.
copper, which is worth only 265. with the metal at
£65. For 12 weeks to March 18, 73,246 tons were
smelted for 1505 tons of blister containing 1485
tons of copper, 104,0940 z. silver, 19660 z. gold, equal
to approximately £1 12s. 6d. per ton of ore
( £21,000 for precious metals and £96,525 for
copper). Copper is taken at £65, which is lower
than the price obtained for electrolytic copper dur-
ing the half-year. Still, there are charges for
refining and realisation, also for development and
depreciation, so the net profit for the half-year will
be moderate unless the superphosphate industry
comes to the rescue. The Rosebud mine, 8J miles
from the MacGregor railway, and owned by the
Corella Copper (Cloncurry), has 2200 tons of free
smelting ore at grass, the result of development
work. The ore shoot lias been proved for a length
of 240 ft. at No. 2 level, and calls are to be made
to provide smelting equipment. It is probable that
a smelting plant will be shifted to the Rosebud from
Marabah.
Tyrconnell in the old Hodgkinson Goldfield
(Q-), is cheerful over the two or three preliminary
crushings reported. The ore treated so far has
averaged ljoz. of gold, from a reef four to five feet
wide. The returns sound good enough, but there is
no mention of how much of the stuff mined was
picked out and treated, and how much was left be-
hind. On the other hand, the recoveries were only from
the plates and boxes, as the concentrating plant is
not yet finished. Driving is being extended north
and south along the 150 ft. level. Separated by a
narrow band of mullock, there is a footwall reef
about 3ft. wide. A small trial crushing from this,
averaging ioz. ner ton, has just been reported; so
if this is considered payable under the local condi-
tions, the stoping width will be about 9ft. Unfor-
tunately, the past history of this field suggests
patchiness for the future. Meanwhile, the co. has
obtained 5970 z. bar gold ( £3 10s. per ounce) during
the last two months. There are 140,000 shares,
which is a big bunch to pay a dividend on.
* * * *
During the spell from smelting, Chillagoe
(Queensland) intends to sink the main shaft at
Einasleigh and open up new ground below No. 5
level. Winze prospects at 38ft. below No. 5 are
good, for the ore assays 9 p.c. Chillagoe is also in-
terested in Giroflia and Lady Jane mines at Mungana,
which so far has produced much valuable ore at a
heavy loss. In January, 2182 tons of Mungana ore
were smelted for 10,5610 z. silver, 12.3 tons copper
( £741), 172 tons of lead ( £3002) ; total, 2182 tons
for £6OOO. There is higher-grade ore in the Lady
Jane mine, and filling up the workings to put the
fire out is proving very slow. Chillagoe shares have
been a gamble for years past. Before the first re-
construction they fell to 3d., and within two years
were selling at 10s., and yet there was never much
hope of a dividend. More cheerful news comes from
the Etheridge gold mines (reconstructed), which is
developing the Queenslander mine with 6ome
success.
* * * *
Kelly’s Queen Block (Charters Towers)
has prepared a reconstruction scheme, and proposes
to form anew co. in 48,000 shares of ss. each, all
contributing. There are 144,000 shares at present,
so the proportion is one to three. Some time since
Kelly’s acquired the Welcome and Union leases, which
produced some good stone 20 years ago but were
neglected on account of dampness. The shaft starts
in decomposed granite, so with a good equipment,
sinking should be rapid. It is proposed to sink
400 ft. vertical. Kelly’s has received a Government
loan of £SOO (£ for £), and for some time past
has been busy erecting machinery and surface
buildings at the Welcome lease. The new claim will
be paid for out of profits on a 10 p.c. basis, so the
whole of the new capital will be available for
development work.

At the meeting of creditors of the New
Queensland Copper Cos. last week, the official liquida-
tor reported that the payment of claims depended
chiefly on an early sale of the mines at a satisfac-
tory figure. Failing this, the royalty received from
the tributors would be a reliable asset to cover all
costs, and to enable dividends to be declared from
time to time. Unless the liquidator is a Heaven-
sent works manager, it is somewhat difficult to
reconcile this last statement with the fact that with
the same mines, the same ore and the same smelter
the company has been steadily going to the bad for
years past with copper at least as high as at pre-
sent, until the principal creditor, whose claim is
£19,815, and the Q. N. Bank bucked, and left the
company with assets of £22,428 against liabilities
of £32,645. Meantime, the tributors are sending
along some very nice ore —parcels of 50 tons averag-
ing 20 p.c. copper—with the result that 230 tons
of matte have been produced and shipped since
January 21, containing 80 tons copper, 330 z. gold
and 35000 z. silver, worth over £4OOO.
* * * »
Ivanhoe (W.A.) has resumed work after
the fire, and operations have reached normal. Man-
ager’s latest estimate of ore reserves is 991,417
tons, of an average value of 38s. 6d. per ton. This
shows a decrease of 99,433 tons in quantity, and
2s. Id. in value compared with the figures of a
year ago, but the drop is put down to the fact that
all principal development work for the past 12
months has been in a barren porphyry zone at depth,
and although payable values were met with in places,
they have been considered too unreliable to take into
account. A large quantity of the ore opened up in
the deep workings was also found to be not amen-
able to economical treatment by the present reduc-
tion plant, and this necessitated heavy withdrawals
from the upper levels reserves. As usual, nearly
three-fourths of the ore in sight is contained in the
east lode workings, and as the big porphyry intru-
sion is in the bottom of them another big falling off
in reserve tonnage and values during the current
year seems certain.
* * * *
From Weston’s: Edna May.—The back of
No. 3 rise above the 73ft. level is now all in quartz
of 2oz. value, and more ore is being opened up in
this part of the show than was anticipated. Soft
ground has delayed the progress of the vertical
bore, and it is doubtful if time will permit the
putting down of the intended second (inclined) bore
before the option on Duff’s leases expires. As nothing
conclusive in regard to the course or value of the reef
in deep ground is likely to be disclosed in the interim
local holders are wondering what the Board will do.
....Edna May Central.—Development is being
pushed ahead, and preparations made for the recep-
tion of the shaft headgear and hoist, and the battery
should be running within four months.
At the Associated Northern meeting
(W.A.) chairman Landau professed to be deeply
concerned about the condition of the co.’s Ora
Banda show. First, a half-expected creep material-
ised and cut off oxidised supplies, and then the sul-
phide zone did not prove as rich as the optimists on
’Change predicted. Outside the main shoot, the re-
serves of free milling ore are irregular, and it will
be much more economical to allow them to stand
till the sulphide mill is in operation. This, Landau
pointed out, was regrettable, but in the circum-
stances unavoidable. Developments in the lower
levels having “improved” since the date of Professor
Liveing’s report, that expert has agreed to the imme-
diate installation of a sulphide plant at a cost of
£19,000, but this figure may be somewhat reduced
by the removal of part of the mill on the Iron Duke
(Kalgoorlie) lease. Meantime, the Ora Banda shaft
is being deepened as fast as possible, and other
development is being pushed ahead.
* * * *
Ida H. (W.A.) claims to have struck a
bit of good ore at 1200 ft., and over a working width
of 42in. values are stated to average 42dwt. Cheer-
ful cables have been sent to London, and the most
of what is really only a small thing is being made
on the market there. The co. generally manages to
get something good into print about either its
Westralian gold or Nigerian tin show on the first
Tuesday or last Thursday of each month.
* * * *
Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) quarterly
report states that the ore encountered in the
bottom of the mine during that period was not of
profitable grade. In other levels developments were
satisfactory, the proportion of driving on payable
ore showing an increase. The lease of the property,
which expired on December 31, has been renewed
by the Government without any alteration in the
term or condition of tenure. Capital expenditure for
the quarter amounted to £7410.
* * * *
Almost every second mine promoter is
either looking for, or reckons he has got, a molyb-
denite show in the West. Several leases have been
pegged on the Murchison, one or two have been
taken up in the vicinity of Leonora, and a number
are being applied for in other parts of the State.
In most cases, the published report of the discovery
winds up with a remark that at the present price
of molybdenite the assay value of the ore in sight
is equal to so many oz. of gold per ton. As some
of the finds are being boosted by persons with a past,
a visit by the Government geologist or some other
State expert is needed. Otherwise the public might
suffer.
* * * *
Another of the young men attached to the
State Geologist’s Department has been having a
glance at Holden’s Find (W.A.). He reports that
Whittaker’s reef, together with the spur reef, looks
promising, and might pay with a battery on the
spot. Other payable reefs, he naively remarks, may
exist at the Find, but they have not yet been found.
However, he considers that the district warrants
further prospecting.
One last chance, as a local paper puts it,
has been given Bayley’s Cos. (W.A.) to work its pro-
perty or make room for someone who will. Practi-
cally every able-bodied resident of Coolgardie
opposed the co.’s application for further exemption,
and urged that it be deprived of its holding. An
additional month, however, was granted. A few
tributors have since been put on, but according to
local opinion this method of holding the ground is
a farce, and ought not to be tolerated by the Mines
Department.
In 1913 the Transvaal gold mining cos.
treated 26,287,840 tons, compared with 26,071,841
tons in 1912, while the figures for the Rand alone were
25,628,432 and 25,486,361. The yield per ton for
the whole country was 275. 9d., a fall of Is. 3d., and
costs were reduced to 17s. lid. At £12,189,105,
the working profit is nearly half a million less;
dividends totalled £8,194,099. On the whole year
there were 115 fewer stamps and 17 more tube mills
working, but in December there were 284 fewer
stamps in operation than in the corresponding month
in 1912. Only 67 p.c. of the declared profit found
its way into shareholders’ pockets. This, after all,
is the real and only profit.
* * * *
Frank Duff’s syndicate proposes to do
something decisive with the Broncho leases at Nevona,
Yilgarn (W.A.). The Great Victoria shows low-
grade ore bodies alleged to be hundreds of yards in
length by hundreds of feet in width. A million tons
to the 200ft. level in the Great Victoria (recoverable
value 16s. a ton) represents the development at
that end. The Broncho at 100ft. shows 50ft. of ore
stated to bulk 5dwt., and the Grand National shows
also a big bodv of low-grade ore. Apparently it if
a matter of much water and heavy milling equip-
ment, which means a big initial outlay, but there
seems to be plenty of stone of the bread-and-butter
grade.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, March 30, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
Did you notice the announcement that the
Earl of Onslow had resigned his billet as
“assistant clerk” in the British Foreign
Office? Though this ■ high-toned stronghold
of British officialdom is mostly peopled with
sprigs of the nobility, -the accumulated glory
of being assistant clerk must be very thin to
a man, two of whose forebears climbed to
the eminence of the Speaker’s chair
in the House of Commons and whose
predecessor wore the Excellency crown
of Maoriland. The present Onslow’s
official progress seems to be of the
downward variety. He is described as hav-
ing been: (1) Attache, at Madrid; (2)
Attache at Tangier; (3) Third Secretary at
St. Petersburg—which sounds less blood-
thirsty and no more important than being
Third Murderer to the Duke of Milan; (4)
Private Secretary to two moderately im-
portant politicians; (5) Second Secretary
at Berlin; (ti) Secretary in Charge of Com-
mercial Affairs at Berlin; (7) Assistant
Private Secretary to Sir Edward Grey;
(8) Clerk in the Foreign Office; (9) Pri-
vate Secretary to the Permanent Foreign
Under-Secretary; (10) Assistant Clerk in
the Foreign Office. And all this lias hap-
pened to the Earl since 1902. Apparently
he is the most passed-along, affably-shunted
and gently-got-rid-of-and-shown-the-door man
in the service. Now he is (11) Retired
Assistant Clerk. Presently he may be (12)
Honorary Office Boy. For the possessor of
a title and 13,500 acres of English land, and
a member of the Beefsteak Club to boot, this
hunger after small diplomatic jobs seems
uncanny.
Little Robertson Clark, who used to
A.D.C. here, and latterly had a brief look-in
as Help to ex-Governor Islington, of M.L.,
is soaring towards British politics. He is a
grandson of the late N.S.W. politician,
Jock Robertson, as you know, and may have
some of that veteran’s turn for angry debate,
though he can’t possibly talk through his
nose, as his ancestor did. Poplar is men-
tioned as the constituency in which the Aus-
tralian is making honeyed remarks re his
chances as a Unionist member and a saver
—or loser —of the country. Will Crooks,
M.P., once had a tight grip on that horny-
handed neighborhood, but it slipped through
his fingers while he was globe-trotting this
way.
The Australian boy in khaki made a gal-
lant stand in a deluge of rain for the Great
Parade. Part of the parade was full of
very wet boy, and the remarks of General
lan Hamilton had to be hung out to dry
before thev could be passed on to the young
army. The cyclonic storm which filled the
Boy with water came down on the head of
that chirpy youngster in a discharged water-
spout, while Centennial Park floated more
or less in rainfall. An obliging sun got into
business again so quickly that the Lads in
Khaki were moderately dry at the end of the
inspection.
Secretary H. M. Somer wears a subdued
expression as the outward and visible sign, I
suppose, of a meek and chastened spirit,
when he mentions the forthcoming Women’s
Section at the Easter Show. Nearly every
woman exhibitor who has ever said anything
about this section has said it through her
clenched teeth, and has afterwards waved
her umbrella bitterly in the air. And she
has asked, ‘*Where is Mr. Somer?” in a
voice of thunder when her patchwork quilt
or floral pillow sham (same as grandma
used to. make) failed to get first prize.
Seven or eight years ago the Show Secre-
tary was a large, important-looking man
with a commanding Presence. But the lady
exhibitor has deduced him to about half his
former' size. Also, she has so impressed
him with Her great worth and the great size
of his own unimportance that he now retires
meekly to some secret fastness behind a roll-
top desk, and considers himself a Worm
when Woman is on his tracks. The fact
that the standard -of work sent in hitherto
has been down to fairly poor level can only
be mentioned in safety behind closed doors
or spoken anonymously through a public
telephone. Therefore, Secretary Somer says
in public each year —he has to say it to save
his life —that the Women’s Section is going
to be better than it ever was before. No
doubt he prays that it may be or that lie
may be absent if it isn’t.
The 1914 show (women’s section ) will be
better housed, to begin with, for £3OO has
been spent on glass to cage in the more
nerishable exhibits. Extra prizes have been
hurled at the needlework section. The Show
secretary is therefore basking in the great
calm that sometimes comes before a storm.
No doubt he will be interviewed by all the
non-prize winners.
The ride astride is not so easy as it looks,
to women who have been accustomed to be
horned on to their saddle. Mrs. Stace, one
of our most dashing riders over timber at
big events like the Easter Show, prefei’s the
old style. Dolly Fogg, the Tasmanian
rider, is a clever pupil of the astride school.
The McCulloch' girls (who class as ama-
teurs), from the Western District sheep-
folds of Victoi’ia, bring their own mounts
to the Ladies’ hunting contest on the Show-
ground. Stiff, four-feet fences are negoti-
ated easily enough by both sisters. The
tall and graceful Alice McCulloch rides
astride, and sister Kathleen is of the same
niind as to the balance of her avoirdupois
in the saddle. Myra Smith, a Coonamble
girl who is going to leap the fences on a
good mount at the big Horns and Hoofs
display, is another country horsewoman of
note.
The squatting Falkiners, of Riverina, will
be leading exhibitors of draught horses at
the Show. It was J. S. Falkiner and Sons,
by the way, who bought the famous Wid-
giewa sheep station from Horsfall senior.
The latter has recently smelt gunpowder so
severely that he has offered a large sum to
help stiffen the eastern half of Ulster in its
howls for civil war. Won’t the Horsfall
family be delighted if Ed. Carson hurifiedly
cables for the cash?
Curator Edgar Waite, of Christchui’ch
Museum (M.L.), passed this way the other
day on the trek to Adelaide. Mr. Waite is
a recognised authority on things that are
dead and stuffed, and on tame minerals in
glass cases. Ch. Ch., which is almost as
flat as yesterday’s pancake, is probably more
over-run by bicycles than any other three
towns on earth. Its inhabitants collect
cycles from their earliest infancy, and they
grow up to carry ladders or sewing
machines, or grand pianos on wheels, and
trundle them gaily off to the other side of
the pancake. Christchurch is extremely
proud of its museum and its cathedral spire.
The latter falls down suddenly in the street
at unexpected intervals, owing to earth-
quakes, but it is. a kindly ruin and has never,
to my knowledge, even killed a kitten. But
once it so scared a passing mouse that the
animal’s tail turned white inside 24 hours.
Mischa Elman, the young Russian Jew
who has fiddled his way to fame at the age
of 21, leaves ’Frisco for his Australian tour,
under Manager Shipman, on May 4. He
brings as excess baggage three violins of
such value that they have to be marked
“Glass with care,” and “To be kept out of
the wet,” and “Not to be handled without
saying grace first,” and other little things
like that. When Elman was in his early
knickerbocker stage, at six or seven, he went
to St. Petersburg to get more instruction on
his fiddle. His Semitic origin was overlooked
in that unpleasant city, owing to his top-
lofty position as an infant phenomenon. But
Elman, senior, being an oi'dinary music-
teaclier, was debarred by the shape of his
nose, from free entree as an equal to one of
the palatial halls in which son Mischa was
temporarily located for his studies. So Daddy
Elman had the pluck to get inside the por-
tals as a servitor, and pass round the coffee
or something, while he watched his young-
ster’s capers with the fiddle.
Civil-servant John Souper, of the M.L.
Railway Department, has been over here on
a visit. His special business is to
keep both eyes on the management
of the dining-cars in the North Island.
I suppose if any traveller finds a
fly in his _ mutton-broth he forwards
the body, with indignant remarks, to J.
Souper. The latter has just returned to
Maoriland after a trip to Adelaide and
Melbourne by rail. This gave him every op-
portunity of observing the dazzling success
—or otherwise —of the Sydney-Melbourne
dining-car sei-vice. Mr. Souper was a closed
oyster on his recent observations.
The Osborne Clan, which is mostly devoted
to the sheep industry, is going to make a
combined splash during the April razzle-
dazzle. A ball, with a heavy top-dressing of
Osbornes in chai-ge, is already booked as a
special event by the Right People..
Mrs. Cecil Youl, the smiling, bustling lady
who has been one of the pillars of the Chatri-
otic Club (Bligh-street), is to be farewelled
by that assembly prior to her departure for
Britain. Have you noticed how frequently
“prior to her departure” creeps into print at
this migratory season?
The Women’s Horticultural Society, which
is still above ground, had an adjourned meet-
ing in the School of Arts the other evening.
The forepart of this meeting occurred some
time in December, but the talk having over-
flowed the meeting, it was indefinitely post-
poned. Enthusiast Clieel (on the Botanic
Gardens staff) is president of the Haughty-
cultural Guild —for the present, anyhow.
Miss Brace has been secured as hon. organ-
ising secretary. Mrs. Shand and Miss Moss
are vice-presidents. Miss Munro is honorary
treasurer, an honorary treasurer being the
person who holds the empty cash-box which
is full of the unpaid cash, and receives no-
thing for her efforts. There may be another
dozen or two of hon. officials I’ve forgotten
to mention, but I hope they’ll overlook it.
What this guild seems to really want is a
squad of a hundred or two ablebodied young
women who will consent to do spade work
and grow things. A horticultural society
should at least raise one primrose by the
river’s brim. The notion of buying or hiring
a head or two of cabbage and a few parsnips
and melons from a Chinaman, to exhibit, is
only suggested here as a desperate remedy
for a horticultural guild which is chiefly en-
gaged in sowing the seeds of lengthy argu-
ment.
The Shakspeare Festival committee and
its friends, enemies and stallholders have
not yet come to blows at any of their innu-
merable meetings. They have only changed
their minds, and firmly contradicted each
other in a spirit of Christian forbearance
and infuriated resignation, and the amuse-
ment committee is still collecting its amuse-
ments without the aid of sticking plaster.
The Town Hall, with a sturdy roof to keep
out the possible inclemency of the weather,
is to shelter the affair which opens on April
22. This is a safer scheme than tempting
Providence in the open, as at first intended.
The Elizabethan procession is expected to
provide the riotous mirth which these fancy-
dress efforts always throw in as an extra,
to the impartial spectator.
The Charles Marsdens have flitted off to
England, after a swift procession of the
interminable tea parties that speed the part-
ing Australian up the gangway of outgoing
mail boats. They dodged the English win-
ter by summering hereabouts. Mrs. Mars-
den used to be Miss Evie Thorne, of this
roadside village, and she leaves stacks of
relatives.
A collection of Phil May’s black-and-
white drawings was recently sold at
Christie’s (London) for 120 guineas. Out
of this sum 15 guineas went for a group of
six drawings which included “Sending-in
Hay at the R.A.” and “Do You Want a
Model, Sir?” There was rather a slump in
Turner at this sale. A small drawing,
“Swallow Falls in North Wales,” by that
cunning master craftsman, only brought the
hammer down at forty-two shillings.
Mrs. O’Brien, mother of the Kitty O’Brien
who has recently been appointed cartoonist
on the London Daily Chronicle, writes
from Surrey, England, re the girl’s success.
Kitty was a small child when the family
moved off this map to the other side. Her
father was the Bulletin writer J.O’B.
(Joseph O’Brien). As the conservative
London press does not often get away
from moss-grown tradition, the news
that Australian Kitty has broken into
the artistic fold as cartoonist —a billet
considered sacred to the male person—is
worth a blot of ink here.
Ella Caspers’s concert manager and ad-
vance agent is a young Australian just back
from a year’s sojourn in London. His name
is 11. M. Potts. He is a brother of the
bank clerk Potts who was stationed in Yass
about seven years ago, and got up a success-
ful complimentary concert there to the Goul-
bui-n contralto whose voice was beginning
to be talked about.
The Maxwell-Rosenwax concert in the
Town Hall, on April 4, has put up a good
booking record to date. Ren4e Maxwell is
the girl with the soprano voice—it is said to
be an outsize in sopranos—who leapt into
prominence during the last Quinlan opera sea-
son here. That roving chief of the innumer-
able first night fray heal'd the voice warbling
in the gallery before the scene-shifters had
arranged the stage thunder. The present
proposition (d.v. and other unforeseen cir-
cumstances permitting) is, that the young-
ster (who is about 18 summers young) will
go off to Europe under the wing of teacher
Nathalie Rosenwax.
Fiddler Pechotsch has come back to Syd-
ney after sojourning three years in M.L. He
is going to settle down in this clachan. His
clever son Raimund is fiddling with consid-
erable success on the other side.
Clement May, the Dickens entertainer at
the National, talks of taking his own com-
pany to the “Near East” —it’s the Nor’-West
when you come to think of it—after his en-
gagements here have flickered out to loud ap-
plause.
Judge and Mrs. Edmunds and a daughter
are viewing the scenery from the hostel at
Kosciusko this week. Lawyer Edmunds is
the man who frequently sits on tangled com-
missions, which leave the combatants with
knotty tempers, so I supnose he finds it rest-
ful to sometimes stand 7000 ft. above litiga-
tion, and commune with the clouds, and
bump his head against the stars, and ask the
welkin in confidence how it is getting on.
Shoals of small concerts of the minnow
species are heaving into sight, with a few
young whales in the offing. The country
still keeps its end up in the matter of produc-
ing Voices of agreeable quality, and “Prior
to her departure for Europe” is the favorite
headline of the season’s voice or piano scram-
ble.
Another homing pigeon, contralto Lois
Zucker, blew into Sydney the other day.
She has been away for a considerable time
putting the polish on a remarkable voice, in
London and Milan.
Mr. F. W. Flanagan, General Valuer in
the M.L. Government department which tots
up the cash value of estates, etc., is here on
a holiday.
Pastoralist A. Judd, of Blayney, who owns
about the longest string of jumping horses in
Australia, is the favorite mark for sporting
women riders at the Show. The good-
natured Judd is an easy victim when a
horsey Petticoat Avants an extra mount.
A.D.C. Robins and his wife, and two mem-
bers of the Strickland kindergarten —aided
and abetted by their vice-regal papa—joined
the Peerage Grey cave party at Jenolan this
week.
The Prince Alfred Hospital committee is
able to announce the arrival of the last load
of bricks, for the recent addition to the
Nurses’ Home, w r ithin its gates. The
directors will celebrate the event at the
annual general meeting on April 6. Gov-
ernor Strickland will take the chair, but will
return it when he is done with it.
The Tom Dixsons, of Rcdleaf, and their
connection, Dr. Marion Thornett, went off
to Europe in the Grama the other day. The
lady oculist ran away from a lucrative prac-
tice in Sydney. She is engaged to our ex-
Iiailway Commissioner Tom Johnson, and
he has presumably signalled to her that the
line is clear as far as Dover. The wedding
is said to be timed for the immediate future.
When a confirmed bachelor persuades a
determined spinster to say “yes,” they seem
to be just as impetuous as if they were in
the teeny age.
Commander Lewin, R.N., recently trans-
ferred from the Tingira to the elderly gun-
boat Encounter, is now added to the long
list of obstinate bachelors who have recanted
and bought engagement rings. The lady in
the case is Miss Ruth Dangar, a daughter
of Henry Dangar, M.L.C., of Grantham, a
turreted castlette at Potts Point. Yards
of congratulation are pouring in to the
lucky man, for his fianefie is One of the
Best.
Mrs. Mayoress Richards took the top-end
of a table at last week’s meeting re the
Olympic Ball. A few suggestions were tim-
orously handed in, for most of the mighty
battlers of ball committees were absent. The
gloomy precincts of the ladies’ cloak-room in
the Town Hall, in which this meeting
mopped its perspiring brow, were not con-
ducive to any rush of ideas to the heads
of the company, but the most live persons
present kept up a dogged attack on the
fancy-set features of the frivol.
All the Easter revelry will come with its
accustomed thud more or less at once. A
Matrons’ dance occurs on April 7 ; also there
will be another on the 14th, and a similar
entertainment, given by eleven mem-
bers of the Osborne family, occurs
three days later. Races, dinners, tango
jumps or hops, and the R.A.S. Show
make a background to a list of Society
freaks and feeds. The whole lot gives the
plain citizen —and some citizens are lament-
ably plain—the giddy feeling of looking over
a steep precipice of dressmakers’ bills.
According to the gospel of a London
critic, the eighth exhibition of the Modern
Society of Portrait Painters was chiefly re-
markable for one thing. This was the gap
between the best and the worst things in the
show. Like the little girl in the nursery
rhyme, when they were good they were very
very good, and when they were bad they were
horrid! “The honors,” says the voice of
authority, “rested between Mr. Gerald
Festus Kelly and Mr. Glyn N. Philpot—
Mr. G. W. Lambert coming third with a
single contribution, and scoring heavily in
his drawings.” Lambert’s portrait of
George Reid impressed the critics as “a
triumph of skilful arrangement.” It is deli-
cately hinted that the problem of painting
Australia’s banquet expert without making
him look too large for the frame and the
apartment and the century was very cleverly
managed.
Snowy Baker sends a postcard from about
the 42nd floor of an American hotel (town
not stated), and remarks that it’s a good
long way from the face of nature and the
comparatively simple life in sunny N.S.W.
Mrs. Baker keeps on recovering from her
recent illness. An inky arrow indicates the
eyrie, in a building that looks like a gigantic
steel tank, where the Bakers were sus-
pended in mid-air, when they posted the
missive. The place is called “the Biltmore
Hotel,” which is presumably a pun, intended
to state that the owners of the place built
more than any other local hotelkeepers.
The Mater Misericordise Hospital for
women and children (North Sydney) has
put up a valiant fight for more space for its
patients. The nuns in charge have, at odd
times, camped here and there in any old
corner, in order to grapple with the fact
that their hospital was about three sizes too
small to hold the applicants . for relief.
Archbishop Kelly laid, on a recent after-
noon, the foundation-stone of a new build-
ing which is to ease the present shortage,
and great was the jubilation thereof.
The Macquarie manuscripts, judging from
the snacks published in the daily press, con-
firm the writings and opinions of many
modern searchers into the early story of
N.S.W., re that stormy petrel, Parson Sam
Marsden. Governor Macquarie had a very
sharp thorn in his foot when that ardent
apostle of the cat and the gallows and the
gospel was in one of his tantrums.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, March 30, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The everlasting tango got another adver-
tisement the other day, when Hugh Mcln-
tosh invited 100 parsons to attend a tea.
The Church waved pudgy hands in the air
and refused to spoil its valuable ignorance of
the contortion, but 20 or so suburban saints
sent their wives to investigate. (Presum-
ably the soul of the saint’s wife doesn’t mat-
ter or it is easily saved or something.) These
ladies ventured in singly, none daring to
drag a friend to such iniquity. Later on, they
looked as if they enjoyed the show.
I felt sad when I reflected that, in
all probability, it never would happen
again. Of course they had never seen any-
thing quite like it at the mothers’ meetings.
They were joyfully bewildered by Josephine
Davis’s ragtime, and an American vaude-
ville troupe opened a new and extraordinary
world to them. One serious little lady
remarked that the tango was “quite nice.”
She was in the stalls, and tall Dudley Ham-
ilton’s friendly smile had captivated her. She
gasped rather at the Gaby costume parade,
blushed at the pyjama promenade, and then
remarked in true critical spirit that _ the
unbound hair of the parade girls was “miser-
ably skimpy.” Her own hair was piled up
in lustrous coils. I think there was one lone
parson there, but he had his face tied up in
white flannel for toothache, and identifica-
tion was difficult. He was probably an
archcurate. The girl who flings flowers
to the house refused to give him one, so he
went home early. Norton Grimwade, with
his wife in a pink silk coat, sat severely in
the stalls and repulsed the sirens, who would
have plied them with ices and tea and buns.
This free tea business is bewildering in a
theatre which was never built on a sociable
plan. The passing of cups from hand to
hand is a bother, and you feel as if you had
been appointed butler to the whole theatre,
being recompensed more or less by having one
cup of tea for yourself. The management
has already lost five dozen teaspoons, and is
thinking of experimenting with chopsticks.
If some people don’t hurry up and become
honest, chopsticks are bound to arrive.
Chester Manifold’s daughter Marion is to
marry Mr. P. G. C. Adams on April 14, at
Talindert, Camperdown. It is safe to pre-
dict that there will be not less than 550
Manifolds at the wedding. Bride-elect
Marion has a remodelled homestead on a
sheep run heading her list of wedding gifts.
The generous donor, of course, is her devoted
dad.
Camperdown arose like one sheep, on
March 18 and motored violently to the
Scotchbyterian Kirk, to see the Knox-McAr-
thur knot-tying, the principals whereof are
now putting up at Menzies’, preparing for a
long honeymoon tour —or perhaps they have
gone. The bridegroom is—or was —William
Knox, son of the departed William Knox who
used to wear the Hat. The bride is—or
was—Mildred McArthur, daughter of the
K.C. who owns a palace in the dear old
bleating town. So far as I remember, about
56 Manifold wives and about 170 Manifold
misses were at the party. (I can’t vouch
for these figures, because it all happened so
long ago, my dear.) Manifolds in Camper-
down are as numerous as rabbits in the
Riverina; consequently it is no distinction to
have one at your wedding. The family is
like the Legion of Honor —few escape it. A
fleet of motors, most of which are now out
of date or scrapped, rushed up from Mel-
bourne at what was then a high rate of
speed. They carried more friends and rela-
tions of both principals. The bride was
pale pink, both as regards complexion and
clothes. The bridesmaids wore strawberry
color, and Mrs. McArthur was a rich cream.
In fact, the whole bygone party looked good
enough to eat.
The Leslie McDonalds are bearing down
upon Australia again. Leslie himself prob-
ably has all his personal belongings in a
couple of suit-cases and a cabin trunk; but I
understand his wife’s bill for excess
luggage is a hair-raising document. There
must be heaps and heaps of dresses, because
the newest wraps squeeze into a handful,
and nightgowns and such things can be run
through a bracelet. The returned voya-
gers possess a niece who is a countess, poor
thing, and what time could be spared from
clothes-gathering was spent at her country
place, watching her at her sums and count-
essing.
Doris Cumming, of the Camperdown
family, is writing home to envious girl chums
about her own particular triumphs in Eng-
land. She was “presented” at Mary’s Court
on the usual charge of being rich and unem-
ployed, and, of course, was found
guilty. The verdict was received with en-
thusiasm by all hands, including the accused,
who was mostly pink chiffon and Ascension
lilies.
A bust of the late £ £ Smith is to be
unveiled to-day (Thursday) in the Exhibi-
tion. Gardens. £ £, who was one of the
original Exhibition trustees, was the last of
the original combination to depart this life.
His shade should be gratified by the memor-
ial busting, for, when alive, statuary was
his hobby, and marble and bronze busts and
figures took up valuable room in his Collins-
street house, and even littered his garden (a
precious plot of lawn and geranium beds in
the very heart of the city). The busts, the
garden and the old house, with the Grecian
columns, made a picturesque and unexpected
break in the avenue of brass-plates. Columns,
garden, statuary and all have vanished since
the doctor’s death —the new wing of the
Oriental Hotel now covering the site. Never
again will the young man who has been out
late send 20s. to the old address and get good
advice and a bottle of pick-me-up.
Dolores is enchanting Maoriland. Latest
reports are from Dunedin, where the mostly
Scawtch community turned out in hundreds
to hear her sing. Dolores is the only woman
member of the local Liedertafel, and a row
of correctly-dressed male singers turned up
and seriously serenaded her on a chilly rail-
way platform, regardless of the mist or what-
ever was falling that day. Something is
always falling in Dunedin.
During the storm of last Friday a Collins-
street flapper got blown away. She was in
black flimsies, with a split skirt and a cob-
webby blouse. The wind caught the one-ply
skirt, whipped it rudely up, revealing black-
silk-stockinged legs about the diameter of
penhandles, and then rushed the feather-
weight damsel helplessly over the street
crossing. A sturdy policeman fielded her before
she aeroplaned .clean away, like Bret Harte’s
heroine, Miss Addie de Laine, and packed
his terrified prize into a hansom cab, which
was handy at the kerb. She gradually
sorted herself in the cab’s interior, and rolled
thankfully home to mother. The whole res-
cue was more like a hat chase than anything
else.
Lady Stanley is a Methody born and
bred, so she didn’t need any prompting at
the Old Folks At Home, an annual event
at the Central Mission. The party is given
to entertain any and every person aged over
60 years, and it has grown with the years,
so that the big spaces of the Exhibition are
now necessary to hold the thousands of
guests that roll up for tea and a song and a
yarn about the early days. The concert is
provided by performers, also aged over 60,
and, at this latest spree, a frisky young
tenor of about 99 or less made his appear-
ance for the tenth consecutive time. Her
Ex. poured tea at one table, and Gaud
Mayoress Hennessy did likewise at another
with an out-size teapot. Suburban mayor-
esses headed tables, surrounded by their own
local ancients, and the Henry Berry family
supplied several tables, with a Berry wife
to pour out tea at each. There were a hun-
dred tables and more, most of which were
run on the same lines. The imported Gen-
tleman Helps are beginning to look restive.
The Methody tea job, for instance, was no-
thing short of buttling. And they weren’t
engaged as butlers.
. Dorothea Spinney, whose job is the Gre-
cian classics, was in town last week with
Miss Dalie Michaelis. The pair have
spent three pleasant months in the Flys_peck,
motoring and rusticating just as the mood
took them. Miss Spinney, who gave her
recitals this time at the St. Paul’s Cathedral
Hall, will shortly make an attempt to spell-
bind Sydney and investigate its artistic soul.
The Willie Grey-Smith twins are stream-
ing off to Colombo to meet sister Barbara
and husband Jack Manifold on their way
back from a Continental honeymoon. The
heavenly pair will enjoy a brief two days’
broil of tropical frivols under the chaperon-
age of Commander Stainer and his Aus-
tralian wife (the Rev. Stanley Lowe’s
daughter), who are doing a term on the
island.
The two Grey-Smith girls were to have
crossed the wet in company with the late
Jack Lempriere and his wife. They were
about to return to the Smoke where two
daughters were expecting them. But poor
Jack Lempriere stayed to play the one more
game of polo which cost him his life. It
was not the first fatal accident in the family
history. The father of the dead man lost
his life in the railway collision at Windsor
many years since.
The Repertory Co. had its Theatre Royal
innings, and a choice assortment of vice-
regal people attended each session. The Den-
man lady never deserts, be the weather ever
so slushy, and she has gradually transformed
her attendant Helps into devotees of Cul-
ture. _ Of course, the fashionables fol-
low in her wake, and Gregan McMahon
thanks his lucky stars —for he has
a hard row to hoe as manager. The
theatre is gradually finding its feet; but it
needs constant watching. The proceeds of
the Denman old clo’ and furniture show
will help it considerably. The vice-regal
patroness, beaming from a box from under
a diamond halo, seems to be meditating plea-
santly on the success of her advertising.
“Rutherford,” which filled the bill on
Thursday last, is a lugubrious play that
would probably burn a hole in the bank
account of a commercial manager; but the
Best People absorbed it and didn’t make
faces. “Reeve,” leading man in “Ruther-
ford,” is in reqj life Bren Doyle, a prominent
railway person who follows the stage in a
greedy amateur way during his spare time.
Greenwood is another Repertory amateur
enthusiast who battles along with rehear-
sals when he isn't attending to the secre-
tarial work of the St. John’s Ambulance
Association. They both complain that work-
ing on such a system they cannot do justice
to the Theatre; but then jobs—real jobs—
have either to be attended to or given up.
Anyhow, it isn’t a bad sort of job that allows
the jobber enough free time for amateur
theatricals. Some jobs only allow for sleep.
Vi Binney, golf champion, is to be
married to Dr. Yule, of N.S.W., some time
in May. Vi, the slight, fair daughter of the
Chevy Chase Binneys, carried off the Open
Championship for cross-country pill smiting
while she was still young enough to go to
school.
There is a pretty Society girl who never
misses the tea-time Block parade. The other
day there was a long, impressive funeral,
and, as the departed was a distant relation
of the little tea-taker, nobody expected to see
her on duty. But she turned up as usual,
dressed in expensive mourning and with
eyes red with weeping, and bravely took hex-
accustomed place in the most fashionable tea-
drinkery. She drank Teas to his Ashes, as
it were.
Our occasional Excellency Madden and
his dame departed weightily in the Medina.
Beatrice Baillieu, the infant of the family,
went along also, and her baby did likewise.
Young Max Pirani, the pianist, also was
there as a passenger, and Lady Denman’s
friend, Miss Alicia Huggessen, had a chatter-
ing flock to see her off. Edna Armytage
gave a mostly-girl party the day before to
say good-bye to the voyager, Help Pollok
being the only male person present. The
Best Fed, whose hearts are always touched
by the departure of social headlights, turned
out in great numbers from the pier trains,
which looked like race caravans disgorging
their loads of fine feathers at Flemington.
John Madden departed, smiling blissfully at
the prospect of a sea-trip and a long, calm
loaf. He had been dined and farewelled
the day previously.
The Plaza —to be opened on April Fool’s
Gay—is a fresh pink rag to the Wowser bull,
which is an undiscriminating animal. Tango
dancing and ragtime skating are to rage
side by side —on special floors, and a supper
room will await the hungry. Di Gilio’s band
will supply the music. Mrs. Riding-mistress
Watt is controlling the management.
State Governor Stanley, while on his way
to visit the artillery camp at Seymour, had
a motor breakdown, and was stranded on
the road until a loyal Samaritan, who hap-
pened along, placed his car at the disposal
of the vice-regal party. It looks as if the
State Government House motors are ageing
like Stonington itself. Those lordly pre-
mises are crumbling at the step-corners,
shrieking for a fresh lick of paint on its
woodwork, and looking lop-sided about the
Venetian blinds. His Ex. and dame must
have smiled wanly when they inspected the
rather dingy place and remembered the ex-
pensive and ridiculous fuss of the “official
landing.” A whole tribe of house-painters
could be hired with the money that was
wasted that day in providing free entertain-
ment for the Best People. And the Best
People are not really destitute —unless per-
haps in the matter of self-respect.
Nineteen professors’ wives will hostess a
reception at the University after Commenc-
ment, which ceremony is fixed for Saturday,
April 4.
Lost dogs are in for a bony time—but not
so the harassed railway officials at the Flin-
ders-street parcels office. The Home for Lost
and Starving Dogs in North Melbourne had
a spree on Saturday to celebrate its first
anniversary. The public was informed that
anyone finding a stray four-legged bark with
an ingratiating air and a tail can leave same
at the Flinders-street station (with sixpence)
and the creature will be despatched to
Macaulay railway station, where it will be
welcomed with three cheers by an ambassa-
dor from the Home. Somebody has given
the dog sympathisers a slice of extra land,
so they feel more hospitable than ever. Dur-
ing its first year the Home received and
temporarily housed 1500 dogs! If placed
longways there would have been enough
dogs to reach from Melbourne well into
Gippsland.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The races at Morphettville on Saturday drew atten-
tion to the prevailing water-famine or rain strike.
Both the lawns and gardens of the course resembled
arid deserts, and racegoers swallowed dust by the
bucketful on the journey to and fro. I hear that water
is to be bored for on the course shortly, with the idea
of making it blossom like the rose, regardless of the
state of the weather. San Juan and Understudy re-
turned dividends of £l9 15s. and £l4 Is. (it is
quite unnecessary to tell you that these were
tote, not bookmakers’ odds), but beyond that
there was nothing sensational. Dressing was
mixed —the fag-end of summer and the begin-
ning of winter; but there were some smartish hats
and a few attractive coats and skirts. Mrs. Corbin,
Mrs. Bowman and Miss Pile, Mrs. Crozier and Mrs.
George Bagot were there; also a few thousand others.
The Tennis Finals (at which, by the way, South
Australia won back the Women’s Championship) were
well patronised by social climbers. And with good
reason. Vice-regality was there. The Way lady
gave away the prizes; the Edwin Smith nobleman
orated. In brief, everything was most genteel. I
noted amongst others, in what I think I am within
my rights in calling the dazzling throng, Mr. and
Mrs. John Shiels and their daughter, the Leslie
Deans, Miss J. McFarlane, the Kyffin Thomases, Mr.
and Mrs. Frank Barritt, Mrs. Roy Burston, Mrs.
W. A. Magarey, the Howard Davenports, a brace of
bishops and several beautiful, flat-hatted young
curates.
The result of all this Saturday gaiety was that
Society had practically no one to spare to lend tone
and the aristocratic flavor to General lan Hamilton’s
review. However, the review survived it.
Miss Adelaide Pankhurst (one of the famous British
troupe of political knockabout artists) is here. She
arrived by the Geelong. She is thoroughly earnest.
Nothing, I believe, but the fact that she was herself
on board debarred her from setting fire to the Gee-
long, as a protest against things generally. She is
just off to Melbourne at the time of writing, and is
rather sheering off newspaper reps. All I have been
able to discover is that she is small and slight and
darkish and nervous-looking—not at all the sort of
person that you would expect to cow policemen and
such-lilce robust characters.
Colonel and Mrs. Makin and Mrs. Davies Thomas
have returned from the Eastern States; also Miss
Herring and Miss Horn.
Final probate on the .1. J Duncan estate has been
paid in the shape of £ll,OOO odd to the Melbourne
Treasury. The total value, in Victoria and South
Australia, is well over £400,000.
The Temperance Conference is over. The speeches
were most edifying. I don’t know exactly when the
banishment of Beer is to begin, but as regards the
immediate future the pubkeepers appear painfully
optimistic. It is most difficult to find one who is
prepared to exchange his establishment for a lemon-
ade shop.
Mr. T. S. Horn, who died in England on March
19, was one of those who struck it rich over Broken
Hill and other mines. He had been living in the
U.K. for years. He married for the second time
the other day, and his widow and three sons survive
him. He was a brother of W. A. Horn, who per-
sonally conducted Lord Ifintore’s trip to the Terri-
tory.
The Medina removed a couple of Adelaide’s youth-
ful and well-gilded bachelors—the eldest son of the
third generation of Barr Smiths and one of the George
Brookmans. The sorrow of it! What the hostesses
will do this winter for dancing men I know not.
My heart aches for them —the hostesses. I shouldn’t
wonder if a few of them committed suicide.
“Heavens!” said a recent visitor from another State,
“have I to dance with that?” indicating a well-
meaning lad, with spots on his chin. Having thus
put all parties at their ease, she yanked hold of the
wretched youth and steered him to the refreshment
counter. I don’t know what hapnened next, but
anyhow the whole thing is a lesson in the wicked
injustice of solvent male adults removing themselves
to foreign parts and so spoiling their friends’ enter-
tainments.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

“Aesculapius”: In ancient Greece they used to
erect temples over natural springs and give to each
a titular diety. We moderns are no less appreciative
of the healthful virtues of a mineral water —only our
methods differ somewhat. For instance, up at the
famous Helidon Spring, the water is secured just as
it bubbles up from the earth, and hermetically sealed
until the process of aeration and bottling is com-
plete. You don’t need a Greek fineness of palate to
appreciate the cool charm of Helidon Spa—it has
the same delicious refreshingness to Billjim as to the
Earl of Hopetoun. As a blender with wines and
spirits, too, it gives just that added snap and
sparkle that counts so much in the sum of pleasant-
ness. You’ll be wise to always make it a practice to
“Figaro”: Read a par. here the other week about
Nature planting the giant stinging nettle in N.Q.,
but close beside it the tree whose leaves serve as an
antidote to its sting. This provision of Nature is
in no way unique, for, just as she curses us with
indigestion so she blesses us with Helidon Spa.
After dining out you’ll have no next morning head-
ache if you take a bottle of “Helidon” before turning
in—this delicious mineral water is Nature’s gift to
those who have dined not wisely but too well. A single
glass will dissolve the undigested food and at the
same time ensure a perfect night’s rest. Quite apart
from its. health aspect, “Helidon” greatly enhances
the flavor of wines and spirits—so truly the way of
wisdom is always to
SPLIT IT WITH
HELIDON.

Surfing costumes will be more elaborate this season.

FIRST SURFING MAID : "Plucky — why, she

SECOND DITTO: “Plucky you call it! Why,
it's dowmight extravagance! She didn't

costume!"
“Vic.”: The question of a port at Gabo or
at Mallacoota (Vic.) interests part of N.S.W. Works
Minister llagelthorn has just visited the locality.
The object is to exploit N.E. Gippsland timber re-
serves. From Orbost to Genoa, in the Gabo district,
there is 85 miles of glorious timber—stringybark,
spotted gum, silverwood and box. Estimates vary
from £45,000 to £90,000 for the cost of making it
available. The Genoa and Mallacoota inlets form a
natural waterway to the coast. The question is
whether to ship from Mallacoota or Gabo. Malla-
coota Inlet, quickly narrowing into Genoa River,
penetrates 15 miles right into the heart of the
woods.
“Eddyson”: William George Mogg owned
a fine hunk of real estate on the Murray near Millen’s
Twist, and was actively engaged in agricultural,
viticultural, and pastoral pursuits by day, and a
hobby to which he devoted the spare hours of night.
This was the preparation of an elaborate marble
monument, to mark his tomb, when at length it
should please Providence to call him down. W. G.
Mogg was about 40 when he first entered upon the
job. He had no knowledge of masonry, but pur-
chased several manuals, and studied the matter closely.
Then he acquired a certain dexterity with the tools,
practising on chunks of old bluestone. When Mogg
began on the headstone his intentions were com-
paratively trivial. He had designed a plain slab on
a granite mount, but as the work progressed, and
he developed facility in chopping rock, W.G.’s aspira-
tions swelled up, and he hit out into high art, carv-
ing little cherubs and great decorative hunks of
marble. A dozen times he finished his monument,
but within a week he was at it again, elaborating
the design. W. G. Mogg was 58 before he finally
decided that considerations of space rendered further
developments impossible, so he put his masonic me-
morial together to see how it would look, spoiling
half an acre of valuable peach orchard in the pro-
cess. Two days later, he was capsized while cross-
ing the Murray in a boat with a. cargo of pigs.
Mogg could not swim; in fact, he did not rise to
the surface to give it a trial. His body was never
recovered ! It was just the sort of thing that would
naturally happen to a man with a name like Mogg.

“Q. 1.8.”: I often wonder why the outback
Australian has never taken to dried meat, the “bil-
tong” of the Afrikander, or the “jerked beef” of
the Western American, as an adjunct to his scanty
bill of fare. It is easy to prepare, and nourishing
and appetising withal, raw or cooked. Also, once
cured, it is practically imperishable. The lean meat
is cut into strips as free as possible from fat, and
dried in the sun. A hard, greyish-brown crust forms
on the outside, till the strip is not unlike a dry
stick. Indeed, there is a S’African yarn of a starv-
ing patrol of Imperial Yeomanry building them-
selves a lordly fire of biltong found in a farm, and
wondering all night what made their chops water.
Under the crust, the deep red meat is tender and
succulent. You shave off the crust and prepare as
the occasion offers. As a change from the ever-
lasting salt beef and mutton it is to be recom-
mended, and, unlike these, it is armored against
the blowfly and the ant.

“Moana”: As the worst name ever sug-
gested for a racehorse allow me to nominate
Phtholognrrh. An application to have that awful
designation registered actually came before the M.L.
Trotting Association the other day, but it was wisely
hurled into outer darkness with a loud curse. At
the same meeting the name Forty Thieves was also
turned down on the ground that it might reflect
on the sport. A very sane and careful body is the
M.L. Trotting Association.

“James Jam”: Are any Abo-ologists also
analytical or other chemists, and have they tried to
prepare cholesterol? I had an order for an ounce of
this elusive stuff recently. Reference books ex-
plained that it occurred in
wool fat, gall-stones, human
brains and the spleen of the
crocodile. Tried wool fat
first, filled the laboratory with
greasy soap and profanity,
and got just 2.5 molecules of
cholesterol. Couldn’t find
gall-stones in any of the ware-
house catalogues. The Mel-
bourne Hospital said it would
take them a month to collect
an ounce of them. Adver-
tisements offering operation
free of charge were unavail-
ing. Likewise, there was
nobody public-spirited enough
to give the use of their
brains for the purpose, though
I offered to have them re-
turned when the cholesterol
was removed, carriage paid to
any address. So now I’m
looking for the crocodile.
Will any tropical Abo-liar who
knows a good, bad-tempered
crocodile, kindly raise its
spleen and forward the same
to me. Until it arrives business is at a standstill,
and analysis of my language shows sulphur dioxide
99.2 per cent.

“Tekelo” : As far as I could ascertain he
was the only white man in the Santa Cruz group, and
the one thing that annoyed him was the steamer
which called upon him six times a year. He was,
although young, a doleful-looking cuss; but he
cheered up when I handed him the mail. “My word,”
he said, after opening a letter, “that’s good business.
The firm’s going to send me to Fortune Island” (away
in the wastes of the Pacific). “A fellow ought to
have a decently quiet time there.”
* * * *
“Atlas”: Grasshoppers, big-stomached,
yellow-green fellows, are annoying parts of Central
Queensland, and the sheep-owners have hit on what
is to me a new scheme for getting rid of the plague.
They drive flocks of jumbucks over the breeding-
grounds just before the flying stage is reached.
Total extinction does not follow, but the slaughter
is a big one, for the sheep is careless about his feet,
and would tread in a casual fashion on an Old
Master if it was in his road.
A FOE MAN WORTHY OF HIS STEEL.
THE OLD MAN : “I couldn't sell dot Scotchman' nodings to-day; but I vill come back
to-morrow."
HIS SON : " You had better vatch him, Fader, undt don't let him get der best of you."
“Harrison O.”: I have known but one re-
formed burglar in my life, and that was Harold
Pardey. The first time I saw him, at a trial which
ended in a pointed reference to three years hard, I
put him down as being a bit more intelligent and
better educated than the average common or masked
variety of confiscator. It was less than three years
later, good conduct having won him early release,
that Mr. Pardey was billed as star performer at a
Christian Convention in one of the largest provincial
towns in the Watt State. This “convention” was an
annual affair, and took the form of a saturnalia of
hymn-chanting, soul-saving, knee-drill and so forth,
extending over three weeks. Harold was down on
the programme for a monologue entitled “The
Story of My Life and Reformation.” I called to
hear my old friend. Dressed in a neat serge, with
cheap but highly-polished boots and shiny collar, he
looked the most prepossessing person on the platform,
which was crowded with “Christian workers” of
both sexes. As an elocutionist, Harold was a husky
success. The story of his career of crime, commenc-
ing in early youth, and including assault and bat-
tery practised on his aged mother, and the deser-
tion of his wife and four children, reduced his
auditors to sobs, and the history of his subsequent
reformation moved them to Alley-looyers and Ah-ha-
mens. I was a little surprised at Pardey, having
previously been assured that he had kept his mater-
nal progenitor in board and brandy up to the time
of her ileath and had himself never married. In
the coursi of his lecturette a jemmy, a mask, a dark
lantern and one or two other objects of interest
were put in as guarantees of good faith, and helped
to make a huge success of the convention, which
had slumped badly for the previous couple of years.
A perfect epidemic of soul-saving set in. All sorts
of people suddenly repented of the sins they had
never committed, and the daily and nightly snatch-
ing of brands drew full houses. Before the affair
had lasted a fortnight Harold was off the bill. It
was officially adumbrated that Mr. Pardey had
gone to spread the Light in other centres. The
truth was that at the time of Harold’s, departure a
collection amounting to over £2O had vanished also.
The treasurer was in the habit of placing the
receipts in his handbag, which he locked in a
cupboard in his temporary office at the rear of the
hall while he retired for a glass of milk and a bun
to strengthen him for the evening orgy. The holy
officials of the convention, true to their business
instincts, decided that if the news of the defection
of Harold became public there would be a big slump
in soul-salvage for the remaining days of the con-
vention. So the story of the laborer in the vineyard
who reckoned he was worthy of his hire, and helped
himself to it, was kept a dark secret. Mr. Pardey
had sufficient knowledge of holy nature to guess that
this course would be taken, for he made no attempt
to conceal the fact that he was the thief, but auda-
ciously left in the treasurer’s empty bag a hymn-sheet
on the back of which he had written in a clerkly
hand: “Better is little with the fear of the Lord
than great treasure and trouble therewith.”
“Pick”: There must be a degenerate breed
of fox in the parts where “The Maorilander” cooks,
if, as he writes (B. 26/2/’l4), .the cold-country
beast has taken to snake and other meats killed by
human hands. My transactions with the fox have
proven to me his distaste for anything not provided
by his own butchery, and it is this that makes him
so unapproachable with poison that he has earned the
uttermost curse of the settler. Anyhow, “Maori-
lander” is the first “Abo.” I have ever met who
had found one day long enough to kill two carpet-
snakes. I started on one eight-footer myself last
summer, and it took me three days to kill him really
dead. And even then several other people told me
they had slain him when I was having a rest.
Finally, I loaded him on to a pile of logs and started
a fire underneath, and that evening all that was left
of him was the track he made as he hurried away
through his own ashes.

“G.S.” : He the Federal Capital site. In
November 1902 I helped to drive a mob of cattle
from near Twofold Bay to a snow lease near
Kiandra. From Bombala to Kiandra was one vast
field of waving grass. The Snowy was a brisk and
full running river, and although it was not on our
route we rode over to see it. We then delivered
our cattle and crossed the mountains on to the
Queanbeyan side at a place called Naas, and from
there on to where the capital is now being built
the country was in the last gasp of drought. What
a change! At the foot of the mountain we crossed
the Muyumbidgee, which contained a fair amount of
water, but from that on the less said the better.
A fair sized mountain creek has as good a supply of
water as any of the alleged rivers we saw, excepting
of course the 'Bidgee, and it is a long way from the
capital as' far as the water supply is concerned.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For the March quarter the consumption of water
at the Governor’s residence, Stonington, was 1,536,000

Down in the Hell that is Richmond, when the winds
of summer blow,
And the sunflower crawls through stony cracks in
the yards of houses low,
In the little Tophets of galvanised iron that crepitate
to the heat
The workers who pay for what they use breathe
grit of the metalled street,
Hot blasts whirl in from the blue-spalled yard and
the basalt street before,
And the terraces bake together in rows, for Hell is
at every door.
The children sicken in breathlessness, and the babies
die of the heat;
For they will not bring the Yan Yean water to
moisten a poor back street.
’Way up nor’-west at Tanami there is driest, purest
air,
And he who thirsts for twenty-four hours is dead
and dried and spare—
Bone-dry as the skin of a waterbag that has lain a
year in the sand—
For the flaming sun burns the traveller’s neck till
he’s gripped by a hot steel hand.
Down on the tracks through the mulga that lead to
Siberia Soak,
The sun and the sand have held strong men till in
the grasp they broke.
Then away in the ridges of Callon Hills where the
baked soil’s hard as teak
Some gumleaves help out the last few drops of the
waterbag for the week.
But here at sap-green Stonington there is not dread
nor drouth,
For twenty thousand gallons a day pour coolly to
its mouth;
The emerald lawns are sweetly damp, and the sun-
flower drinks his fill,
And the dahlia grows with a swollen hide, for the
main is never still;
The salpiglossis finds new tints from the loyal fount
that’s free,
But down at Richmond the tap drips out enough for
a pot of tea.
Oh, Tanami and Stonington, and the green vice-regal
grass,
And down at baking Richmond sits a hot and
bothered ass.

NINETEEN thousand five hundred previous buyers have been satisfied. We have
made and sold that number of pianos, and more Beale I lanos are used in
Australia than of any other make—British or foreign. They withstand alike the
desiccation of our torrid summers in Kalgoorlie, Broken Hill and Cobar, or the me ting
moisture of sugar lands in North Queensland and Fiji. You are safe with a ea e
Piano in any climate. __
The most perishable part of all other pianos is admittedly the tuning system 01
wrest-plank. The Beale tuning-system being solely of iron and steel is wan anted to ast
for generations, it cannot fail, and every buyer will confirm this. A wooden plan vwi
gradually crush, as all makers have to admit, under frequent tuning and twisting o tie
pins. No matter how often tuned —and with Beale pianos tuning is seldom lequne
the Beale system is not affected. '
Beale Pianos contain the choicest Action in the world, by the most expensive makeis
of Pans, specially prepared for the Beale Pianos. Similar actions are also usee :>y tie
leading piano builders of America, France, England and Germany, but on y in tie
higher class.
Beale Pianos although made particularly for exacting Australian conditions have a repu a ion roa .... .
possess abundant proofs. They have won the Grand Prix and three gold medals at the giea ranco nis 1 "
London, 1908. Our pianos are solely used in the splendid Strand Palace Hotel, London, an aan aris ocra _ , pave

Quality for quality you will make a big saving in price.
Buying direct from the makers you save customs duty and middlemen s profits.
You get a longer-lasting piano and twenty five years’ actual guarantee.
Your Beale Piano will have a better touch consequent upon the high-class Action.
The sound boards are warranted not to crack or lose their camber, hence a violin-like quality results, producing the
tone for which our pianos are everywhere famous.
If your Beale Piano should at any time meet with an accident or misfortune we have all parts always ready so that
you can rely upon its perfect restoration. You can only be sure of this with the actual ma ers.

Edison r - on account of the increasing cost of
wood all furniture is destined to be of steel. “Since
the steel for a given piece of furniture costs only
one-fifth as much as the wood. Steel furniture is

"CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Harmless “fruit” laxative cleanses
stomach, liver and bowels without
griping or discomfort.
An acid stomach, clogged with fermenting,
ill-digested food, means that the liver is not
doing its duty. Nature provided ripe fruit
juices to keep the liver up to its work.
“California Syrup of Figs” is a deliciously
refreshing fruit laxative which is always in
season. You can keep it at hand, and it
will be an unfailing friend whenever the
tongue is coated, bowels sluggish, breath
foul, throat dry or sore, stomach full of
wind, and head hot and aching. You can
take a dose whenever it is needed, as safely
as you could eat fresh fruit. In a short
while you will feel the benefit. The bowels
will be gently relieved, and the stomach
cleansed and sweetened as the undigested
food is moved on and got rid of. The tongue
will grow clean again and the head will be
cooled and cleared. There is no mistaking
the beneficial effects of “California Syrup
of Figs.” Directions are with it for adults
and children of all ages. This pleasant
laxative is good for all, and cannot possibly
harm even the most delicate, but you must
ask for “California Syrup of Figs,” and look
for the name and trade mark of the Cali-
fornia Fig Syrup Co. All leading chemists
sell “California Syrup of Figs.” 1/1| and
1/9 per bottle.

OCEAN HOUSE,
MOORE STREET, SYDNEY.
“Harrison O.”: Henry Jackson, beer-
sparrer, was broke beyond repair; and Mr. Publican
Glynn, being quite devoid of gentlemanly instincts,
refused to accept Henry’s assurance, combined with
his Bible oath and his word of honor, that he was
expecting a bloke to repay a borrowed quid to-
morrow. But Henry’s soul craved for beer in large
quantities, so something obviously had to be done.
It was early in the evening when Jackson left
Glyfin’s, and a couple of hours elapsed before his
return. He entered the bar furtively, but with a
gleam of hope in his eyes. Projecting an unshaven
chin across the counter he instructed the clay-haired
barmaid to send for the boss. In the course of 20
minutes Michael piit in an appearance. “If I can
prove 1 ’ave five bob cornin’ to me, will you let me
fake it out?” inquired Henry, in a hoarse whisper.
“An* where are you goin’ to get five bob from?”
demanded Glynn suspiciously. Henry looked around
the bar, placed a finger to his dry lips and issued
an invitation to Michael to follow him. Mike, im-
pelled by curiosity, accepted. Henry led the way
from the hotel, across the railway bridge and down
past the boatsheds on the Yarra bank. “Where are
you takin’ of me?” asked Michael uneasily, as they
approached a large tree which stood silhouetted
against the darkness. Henry held up a shaky hand
for silence, and asked for matches. Glynn fumbled
for a box and passed it to Jackson, who struck a
light. The match flickered for an instant and then
burned up, revealing, lying on the grass beneath the
tree, the body of a man in damp garments. Michael
took one look at the figure, and pouring forth a
shriek proceeded to carve out a record for the dis-
tance to the lighted street. Henry, who saw the
promise of much beer vanishing, followed, making
hoarse noises in Glynn’s wake. Both reached the
pub breathless. “Wot about me beer ?” demanded
Jackson between gasps; “I fished that bloke outer
th’ river, an’ a cove wot finds a corpse gits five bob
from th’ perlice.” Michael, trembling and white-
faced, was in no fit condition to argue. “Give th’
miserable heathen what he can swallow up to five
bob,” he instructed the clay-haired barmaid, and
fled upstairs. That night Henry got as drunk as it
is possible for a man to get on five shillings sterling.
Next day the papers were full of an amazing story
of how the city morgue had been broken into and a
cadaver, which had only been brought in that after-
noon, stolen. The corpse was subsequently found
under a tree on the Yarra bank about 20 yards
from the dead-house.

“Hamer”: In his par dealing with the
articles of “trade” which appeal most to the
gentle Islander, “X.P.D.”. did not mention
the niggers’ passion for leather goods. I was a
Past Grand Order-pursuer for a leather manufactur-
ing firm once, and I did astonishing business with
the island traders. Brief bags, and vast belts —some
of them five inches and many three inches broad —
were the goods that they chiefly took, with the object
of palming them off on the untutored savage. Such
lines, they said, had driven the bead and cotton
business clean out of the commercial ring, so far as
the colored brother was concerned. As for the
Bible business, it never was in the running.
WHY THEY NEVER MEET.
MRS. GEE: “And how is Mrs. Gadder?”
MR. GADDER : “To tell you the truth, I don't
get a chance of seeing her once in a blue
moon. Fact is, she’s always at home.”
EXPLICIT.
THE O'ROURKE : “ I'll be after gain ’ out for a couple of hours, so if anybody calls tell
them to wait for foive seconds an’ I'll be back in tin minits.”
“Pontius Potter”: I’ve just been to a
wedding. There was only one other guest, and we
met the bridal couple on the street corner and
walked to “the manse.” The manse was a derelict
cottage with a broken window propped open on a
partially-bald hairbrush. A black glazed sign hung
on the verandah post and bore the legend, “Mar-
riages Solemnised.” The door was opened by a
woman of large girth, who showed us into the front
parlor and addressed someone in the rear of the
house simultaneously, The pastor answered the call
and explained that it was
his busy day. He was
a small, grisly man, and
grime had made a net-
work on his wrinkled
hands and face. Also he
had been tending the
fowls. He backed out
of the room and reap-
peared a moment later in
a black coat that was evi-
dently kept for these
solemn occasions, and
then got to business with
some celerity. We stood
round looking awkward
and foolish, whilst he
lifted a stock prayer to
Heaven in a manner that
suggested an excited
punter getting his money
on before the tote closed,
or a thirsty man scram-
bling for a last long beer
before the pubs shut on
Saturday night. After he
had scrambled through
some further remarks we
signed the agreements
and left hurriedly. So
the “pastor” earned a
sovereign, Heaven was ap-
peased, the bride had her
license to wear the ring,
and the bridegroom Was
perfectly satisfied until
he learned afterwards
that another “pastor”
in the next block would
have done the job for 15
shillings. Down the street
the registrar would have
done it for half a sov.
or thereabouts; but just
because Lizzie yearns for
some religious formality
and Billjim can’t run to a fiver, they decide to con-
tribute a pound to a frowsy old humbug who should
be doing some honest work for his pawned country.

“Vigilax” : Mosquitoes have been leading a
harried and strenuous life in Brisbane for the past 18
months or so. The health authorities realised that
it was not good policy to sit down and wait for the
opening of the Panama Canal to bring yellow fever
along from the Banana republics in western Central
America, especially as the particular kind of mos-
quito which carries this disease is very common in
Eastern Queensland. The beast breeds for preference
in water tanks, and, before the unfriendly action of
the health people was commenced, some 75 per cent,
of Brisbane’s 30,000 house tanks served as nurseries
for the larvae in summer. Another variety of blood-
sucker, the brown house mosquito, is credited with
carrying dengue fever, and certainly does load up its
victims with the filarial blood worm disease. The
campaign is aimed particularly at these two species
of insects, and the procedure is simplicity itself.
Both are domestic mosquitoes—that is to say, they
do not compete successfully with the bush and swamp
varieties—and breed about houses almost entirely.
If their particular fancies for clean and dirty water
respectively cannot be gratified, Mrs. Mosquito has to
lay her eggs in some place where the resulting
brood will not arrive at maturity. Also, if the larvoe
cannot get a sufficient supply of air to breathe
through the funny little tubes which they wear at
the end of their tails, they will not live to the
curse-producing stage of their existence. So the
enemy sets to work to cut off the lady mosquito from
likely nurseries for her numerous offspring, by hav-
ing all tanks protected with fine wire gauze, and
all unnecessary collections of water about houses got
rid of or made unsuitable for mosquito breeding in
other ways. One of these ways is to put kerosene
or other oil on the surface, the larvae being unable
to shove their tails through the film in order to
breathe, and the oil being more or less fatal to
the female mosquito when she comes to lay her eggs
on it. Another is to stock the water with small fish
which eat the larvae and the mosquito also if they
can get hold of her. A certain fish from Barbadoes,
the “millions,” has had a great reputation in this
direction for some years past, but, like several other
importations, it has proved a failure in competition
with local products. A Queensland fish known as
the “firetail” has earned the enthusiastic commenda-
tion of the health folk, by reason of its George Reid-
like capacity for provender. Unlike our Pie Com-
missioner, however, the fish’s stomach capacity is of
definite value to the place which supports it. The
firetail and others of like habits are credited with
being the sole reason why Queensland does not
become a solid mass of mosquitoes in the summer.
So far the results have been satisfactory, and several
suburbs have been practically freed from the pest,
save for occasional incursions of the swamp-breeding
bush mosquito. When these occur Property yells
loudly and denounces the Government for failing to
oil Moreton Bay. It is a hopeful sign, as up to
recently Property used to pour its moan into the
receptive ear of the nearest tame politician, in the
hope that he would stop this shocking waste of
money. The health people have a pleasant way of
jolting Property with a virulently-colored notice
full of nasty direct words, and of following up this
rudeness by descents of men with soldering irons
and brass gauze and things, for all of which Property
pays afterwards. The ear of the politician, too, is
bitten by such a variety of insects that it is apt to
get sore. The scheme for getting Brisbane into a
reasonably safe condition against yellow fever, when
it comes along, is expected to take three years.

Keogh’s Proposal
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
KEOGH, of Flynn’s Bridge, wanted
the Widow Cody and all her posses-
sions. Mrs. Cody had the “nate
6thrip iv onion counthry.” She had pigs,
and cows, and personal attractions. And the
“crick” that just missed Keogh’s property
went “cavortin’ ’n’ lollopin’ through th’
widdy’s istate” in wanton play. Keogh had
had his eye upon Norah ever since that night
when Patsy Cody took the consumption
“wid sleepin’ out wet” after Mrs. Finnerty’s
wake.
Three days after the funeral Tim Keogh
called on Mrs. Cody. “Ma’am,” he said,
“not t’ be too familiar wid wan havin’ her
sorrer, ’twould not be becomin’ in a Christ-
yin man t’ be talkin’ amorousness ’n’ such
diversion ’n’ yer husban’ that was (good
man! Rest his soul!) jist four days ten
hours dead (as line a man as was breath-
in’!) ; but 1 have a mind t’ tell yeh iv me
natural affections ’n’ me disposition t’ math-
rimony early in November, God willin’.
Manewhile I would ax yeh t’ have th’ matter
in mind, presumin’ anny wan ilse should be
so lost t’ dacency—’n’ wantin’ in good
manners, be th’ same token—ez t’ make to
yeh direct or indirect offers or contingent
tributes iv affection, ma’am.”
“ ’N’ what th’ divil ’re ye dthrivin’ at,
Tim Keogh, at all V” gasped the widow.
“I’m indiverin’, ma’am (not to say Norah)
t’ give yeh due warnin’ iv me hon’rible in-
tentions come November sixt’. If I was
onmannerly ’n’ haythen in me habits, like
them I’ll not mention which I have sore dis-
trust of, I’d be axin’ yeh now t’ duly weigh
’n’ consider—come thim moments when yer
gr’reat sorrer’s not employin’ yer hear-rt ’n’
mind t’ the exclusion iv all matters iv saryis
moment, but wor-rldly—t’ duly weigh ’n’
consider, I say, th’ raysons ’n’ injucements
leadin’ up to a fav’rible view in th’ offer
I’m afther makin’ come November fift’.”
“Are yer th inkin’ iv sellin’ me yer blind
blue cow, Keogh?” said Norah with sudden
suspicion. “If y’are ’tis good time wasted,
’n’ a great shame. I’ll not have her wid her
bumble toe V th’ wild, glassy eye of her,
puttin’ a mock on a body.”
“Tut, tut, tut, ma’am! ’Tis nothin’ iv cows
I’m talkin’ at all, nothin’ iv buyin’ ’n’ sellin’.
’n’ dealin’ whatever, but a matter iv th’
hear-rt, consarnin’ the which I’m con-
sthrained t’ be delikit this day, ma’am, fer
th' sake iv wan deceased (saints help him!
a fine man, if a gr-reat dthrinker in be-
chune), a matter t’ be dealt wid specific ’n’
at th’ same time rapturous, ma’am, on
November one, maybe.”
The widow sat down, and stared at
Keogh. “Man, yer daft!” she said. “What’s
a poor body wid house wor-rk on her hands,
’n’ tin piglets squealin’ mur-rder fer th’
drop o’ wash, t’ do wid all this fine ar-rgu-
ment ’n’ rampageous talk iv Parleymint, ’n’
me with no learnin by me ’n’ no understand-
in’ at all. Will yeh say what hurts yeh in
four words or five—will yeh that?”
“I will, ma’am. I’m sayin’, ma’am, out iv
rispect fer yer condition, ma’am, though ’tis
in me t’ say ‘Norah.’ Yer well aware yer a
widdy woman, no one better, ’n’ ’tis not well
fer wan t’ live alone —which is a wor’rd in
passin’, no more. Bein’ a widdy iv recent
bereavement, wid himself har-rdly comfort-
able in th’ fine grave yeh bought him, ’tis
not polite ’r neighborly or worthy at all in
anny man t’ be obthrudin’ on yer grief ’n’
gr-reat tribylatun wid propositions ’n’ hot
talk, though I wouldn’t put it apast either
Hogan or Crawley, I would not, ma’am.”
“Well, well, well?” said the widow, im-
patiently.
“ ’Tis thim same misgivin’s concernin’
Hogan— not to mention Crawley, ma’am —
that have injuced me t’ call ’n’ state me in-
tentions concerning October twinty. He’s
th’ divil would get in ahead iv a man, him
ownin’ no compuncthions at all, ez ye’ll re-
mimber, no doubt, be th’ lame horse he sold
Cody in the year ’97.”
Mrs. Cody jumped up. “Tim Keogh, will
yeh lave me to me doin’?” said she dis-
gustedly. “I make nothin’ iv yer blather,
you poor body. Is it sick ye are, ’r th’
fever, ’r what?”
“ ’Tis nothin’ ma’am, I can talk of widout
restraint till October ten.”
“Why, man, ’tis October the eight now,
this day.”
“Tut,. tut, tut!” said Keogh, “so ’tis.
True ’tis time flies most wonderful. Maybe
yeh’d not be considerin’ me a man iv gr-reat
sinse t’ be puttin’ off matters iv fine import-
ance fer th’ sake iv a thrifle iv two days,
ma’am?”
“I would not!” said the widow emphati-
cally.
“Then will yeh have me, Norah?”
“Did yeh say November fift’, Timmy?”
“I did not. I said October twinty most
dishtinct.”
“Then ’tis October twinty, Timmy
darlin’!”

They were married on the twentieth of
October.

The Aristocrat
of Brandies
Marbles is a drink of the highest character
and of long-standing, irreproachable reputa-
tion.
It was first produced in 1715, in the world-
famous district of Cognac, France, which is
noted for its ideal climate and the production
of rich, luscious grapes.
Its fine flavor and delicate, aromatic bouquet
appeal readily to all gentlemen of expert
judgment, for it is particularly pleasing to
even the most fastidious palate.
On account of its richness in the higher
ethers Martell’s is specially recommended by
physicians, because its stimulating, nerve-
quieting, strengthening and reviving quali-
ties are really excellent.
Always ask for MartelFs with the Blue and
Silver Label, for it is

Tis the most
popular
Whisky.
At the club, or any place where men meet for social
intercourse, the “Black Square” bottle is kept
on the move.
Men know that it contains a thoroughly reliable
spirit which is of unvarying mellowness —maintained
for over 80 years —and its smoothness and quality
leave nothing to be desired.
Thorne’s is essentially for the man who

Sore Throat and Influenza
THE COMMONEST WINTER CbMPLAINTS :
THEIR PREVENTION AND CURE.
When the days are cold and wet in winter, disease
germs have a much greater power over man than
they have in summer. The reason is that chill and
damp lower the vitality and render the body less
liable to withstand the attack of the germs and t<J
destroy them.
Although Nature has made a wonderful provision
for meeting these germ attacks by delegating to
certain particles of the blood the mission to eat up
these intruders, the warmth and moisture in the
back of the mouth and throat enable the germs to
develop with extraordinary rapidity. Each germ
divides into two in twenty minutes, so that, in the
course of a few hours, a single germ will have pro-
duced hundreds of thousands.
If the body is in a good state of health, the germs
are destroyed very soon after being inhaled, so that
they produce no ill-effects.
When, however, the system is below par or
weakened by any cause, the germs easily overcome
the defending forces in the blood, and we get the
particular disease they produce.
It is in this way that sore throat,
influenza, and bad colds arise.
Obviously the only means of cure
and prevention is to destroy the
germs in the mouth and throat.
Of all the methods hitherto de-
vised by Science for producing this
result, nothing can compare with
Wulfing’s Formamint. This is
unanimously admitted by the medical
profession.
Many thousands of doctors, in-
cluding several to crowned heads of
Europe, have written to the pro-
prietors stating that they invariably
use Wulfing’s Formamint for treat-
ing sore throat. The reason is that
nothing destroys the germs so rapidly
and completely.
This was first proved by a famous
scientist, who removed some virulent
germs of diphtheria from the throat
of a patient seriously ill with that
disease, and mixed them with a
solution of Formamint. Within
ten minutes they were all killed. In spite of
this, Formamint is not offered as a cure for
diphtheria, although it will undoubtedly prevent
that dread complaint and other serious germ-
diseases.
The Prevention of Diphtheria.
This fact is vouched for by many sanitary
inspectors. The sanitary inspector of High
Wycombe, England, writes : “ I know of no other
preparation so effectual in preventing infectious
disease as Wulfing’s Formamint. During an out-
break of diphtheria I have frequently given away
Formamint to those who have been in contact with
the disease, and no other cases have been removed
to hospital from the same household. Whenever
our ambulance is ordered out for the removal of an
infectious case, Formamint always accompanies
us.”
Many articles have appeared in the medical
papers pointing out Formamint’s supreme excel-
lence in the cure of sore throat. In The Prac-
titioner the Chief Medical Officer of one of the
largest Infectious Diseases’ Hospitals in the world
writes: “ I have never had sore throat myself since
I began to use Wulfing’s Formamint, although I
suffered periodically before.”
A writer in the Lancet states : “ I have had the
best results from the use of Wulfing’s Formamint
Tablets.”

THE GERMS OF INFLUENZA AS CEEN UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.
Experiment* made at the Physiological Institute, Berlin, by Dr. Piorkowski.
Fig. 1 shows the germs allowed to grow freely on
a culture medium comparable to the favourable
breeding ground of our throats. Fig. 2 shows the
remarkable decrease in the number of germs when
the breeding ground had «een treated with the
saliva of a person who had sucked three Formamint
Tablets. Fig. 3 shows the entire destruction of the
germs when the breeding ground had been treated
r/itli the saliva of a person who had sucked five
Formamint Tablets five minutes previously. Thus
the sucking of Wulfing’s Formamint prevents germ-
diseases by destroying the germs which cause them.
It shcmld be noted, however, that only Wulfing’s
Formamint produces such results. None of the
many imitations now on the market will do so.
How valueless they are is shown by a physician,
who writes that he “ has tried six substitutes, and
has not found one of them efficacious.”
Remarkable Concensus of Opinion.
The social testimony to Formatnint’s value is as
remarkable as the medical. No preparation, with
the single exception of Sanatogen, which is made
by the same firm, has received such distinguished
testimonials.
The Right Hon. Viscount Massereene and Ferrard
writes: “I have found Wulfing’s Formamint most
effective for the cure of sore throat, which quickly
disappears after using a few tablets.”
The Right Hon. Lord Glantawe writes : “ I have
been using Wulfing’s Formamint for sore throat
with most satisfactory results.”
The Right Hon. Lord Kingsale writes: “I and
my family use quite a number of Wulfing’s
Formamint Tablets, and find them all you say they
are. I always carry a goodly number in my pocket,
and have recommended them to many friends.”
As to their value in influenza, Sir George Alex-
ander writes: “ Formamint Tablets have been my
constant companions during the .winter, and I have
found them a dangerous enemy to the influenza
fiend.”
Among other distinguished users
of Wulfing’s Formamint may be
mentioned the Right Hon. Arthur
J. Balfour, M.P., Sir Gilbert Parker,
M.P., and scores of other M.P.’s; the
Hon. Mrs. Alfred Lyttelton ; Madame
Adelina Patti; and Lord Justice
Buckley, in addition to many leading
barristers, clergymen, actors and
singers, to all of whom the preserva-
tion of the voice and the avoidance
of sore throat is of the utmost im-
portance.
Wulfing’s Formamint may be ob-
tained of all Chemists, price 2s. 6d.
per bottle. A Free Sample will be
sent to every reader who has not
tried it before who writes to Messrs.
A. Wulfing & Co., 17, Bond Street,
Sydney, mentioning the Bulletin.

throat.
The Brown Foreign Protector.
Maoriland has at last come to the conclu-
sion that its so-called defence policy is Bosh,
and' that the dear old Motherland is some-
thing Of a fraud. Up till recently M.L. was
handing in an annual subsidy to Bull of
about £100,000, and raising additional dust
with “Rule Britannia,” “Gorsave” and other
variegated whoops at frequent intervals. The
ultra jingo Ward Government even threw
in a battleship (which was to have been
stationed handy to M.L. for the day of Arma-
geddon on the waters). In return for all this
Bullcoiien supplied his thanks, and appre-
ciation, and bill for interest, and benediction,
and other intangible means of keeping the
enemy from being unduly familiar. The
Massey Government, however, no matter
what its faults may be, has some sense of
national defence obligations. According to
the old arrangement, or swindle, Bullisrael
was to have kept two light cruisers, three
destroyers and two submarines in M.L.
waters and the “gift” Dreadnought was to
be the flagship of the China Squadron. When
Minister for Defence, James Allen, went to
London a few months ago to make inquiries
as to what had happened to the light cruisers
and why the Dreadnought’s location had been
altered to Gibraltar, he was politely pushed
through the window. It was what the
Bohemians used to call defenestration, and it
is worth noting that the Bohemians defenes-
trated once too often, and came to grief.
The Massey Government offered to pay
another £50,000 a year if Bullmoses would
send along the two Bristol cruisers that
should have been forwarded under the bond
of B. Moses in 1909. But B.M. said he
couldn’t do it. Whereupon Premier Massey
has arisen to tell Bullabraham what
he thinks of him, or so much of
it as official dignity will permit, and
the sum total of it is that no
further reliance can be placed on Bullgold’s
word, and that to preserve Maoriland to the
White race Maorilanders must get a move on.
Said Massey a few days ago:—
I do not want to do Mr. Churchill any injustice,
but if he means that the people of Australia and
Maoriland (for the latter of whom I am speaking)
are to be satisfied with the protection afforded by
the Japanese ships and Japanese sailors, then Mr.
Churchill is very much mistaken. I do not believe
for one moment that the Anglo-Japanese Alliance
has secured the safety of either Australia or Maori-
land. It is just as well for Mr. Churchill to know
that.
It has taken Maoriland a long time to cease
leaning on the rotten support that Australia
abandoned years ago, but it is better to be
late than not to be at all.
A Bouquet or Garland of Prophecies.
From “10-2-4”:—
Without claiming to be either a Mother Shiptoh
or an Old Moore, I am willing to forecast (aye, and
to support my views by means of a small ready-
money wager in current coin of the realm) the fol-
lowing political events for 1914. Taking them in
their chronological order, more or less, I hereby fore-
tell (1) a single dissolution of the Australian Parlia-
ment somewhere in the neighborhood of July; (2) a
Federal general election; (3) the overthrow of Cook;
(4) the re-submission of the Referenda questions;
(5) their carriage by big majorities in all the States;
(6) the disintegration of the Holman Ministry; (7)
the breaking-up of the N. S. Wales Legislative Assem-
bly into three parties; (8) another general election
in N. S. Wales.
Consider some reasons for these things. The Aus-
tralian Parliament is to meet on April 14. The
Senate is certain to pass the Referendum Bill, with-
out delay; and the House of Representatives is equally
certain'to fling it out in the speediest possible man-
ner. Cook will then go for a double dissolution.
Nothing is surer than that the new Governor-General
will refuse to give it to him. A Governor is not
entitled to grant a dissolution until he has exhausted,
constitutionally, the whole of the resources of Parlia-
ment —which was the reason, by the way, why Acting-
Governor Cullen, of N.S.W., refused C. G. Wade a
dissolution the other year. It would be putting too
big a burden on a Governor altogether to ask him
to assume that all the possibilities of Parliament had
been exhausted when there was one Chamber with a
majority of 29 to 7 against the appellant’s party. As
a matter of fact, the odium incurred by Lord Glad-
stone in connection with the recent row in South
Africa would be nothing to that which would be
heaped on an Australian Governor-General who agreed
to the dissolution of an elective Chamber with an
overwhelming majority because a rival party in
another elective Chamber had a majority which was
far less satisfactory. Failing a double dissolution,
Cook will go for a single dissolution and get it.
Meanwhile, the Referendum Bill, having been passed
twice by the Senate, and having been turned down
twice by the Representatives in the. same Parliament,
will automatically become a matter to be submitted
to the country at the following general election —this
under Section 6 of the Constitution. This election
should happen, as aforesaid, some time in July. Why
the precariously-situated Cook Ministry, which has
failed lamentably to make good, should be ousted, and
why the Referenda questions, which were only nar-
rowly defeated at a time when the existence of foreign
trusts in Australia was still generally disbelieved,
should be carried, are matters that he who runs (or
even creeps) may understand.
To turn from Federal to State politics, the
Trades Hall Conference which sat in Sydney three
months ago, resolved unanimously that all members
of the Political Labor Party must, in future, “openly
and consistently support the Referenda questions.”
Premier Holman, of N. S. Wales, dodged the last
Referenda campaign by his visit to London. Inci-
dentally he dodged the Trades Hall Conference, at
which he knew the Referenda question was to be
discussed, by his visit to Maoriland. But he cannot
go on dodging this problem for ever. Furthermore,
nothing will induce him to swallow the State Rights
views that he has been voicing for about half a life-
time. Ipso facto he will not “openly and consist-
ently” support the Referenda questions when they are
submitted to N. S. Wales in July. The Labor party
has stood a lot from Holman. He is too astute and
experienced a pilot to be dropped in casual fashion.
But any' further fractiousness on a question which
means everything to the local democratic cause must
constitute the dead limit and the finish of all things.
In the event of Holman again presenting the glassy
eye to the Referenda, the Trades Hall will immedi-
ately test the Labor loyalty of his Ministry "by calling
upon all those members of it who claim to be other
than bogus, to resign. Unquestionably a number of
them will resign. Holman will not worry overmuch.
He is sick of being dictated to by the Trades Hall.
He will take with him into the wilderness of Opposi-
tion a few State Right Laborites and a handful of
dissatisfied Liberals, also an Independent or two. The
Labor party proper may attract to itself a few
Nationalist Liberals —if there is such a thing as a
Nationalist Liberal. The Wade party will present
a more ruined and distracted appearance than ever.
None of the parties will be able to carry on. There
will be a dissolution, followed by a general election.
Further than that my prophetic eye declines doggedly
for the moment to penetrate.
“Cheer-oh” (from London) : Sydney may
get a tip or two from London’s next tube.
It will extend from the Strand to the
Crystal Palace, which dreadful building has
been accessible hitherto by train only. The
new tunnel is to be on the switchback sys-
tem, whooping up a steep gradient of about
one in eight to near the surface at the
stations, and getting way on again with a
rush and a dive down a similar slope on
leaving the station. This not only saves
the enormous initial and working cost of
deep-level lifts, but means quick starting
and stopping by cheap gravity-power. Esti-
mates of anything round the 100 miles-per-
hour mark are freely mentioned. But to
get this all admit that there is only one way
—viz., pointed-end cars AND THE MONO-
RAIL. The engineers are agreed that the
mono appears to be the high-speed and
economical train of the future. The ordi-
nary surface railways in Britain can’t afford
to scrap their huge rolling-stocks, in a
gigantic heap, so it will be a long time be-
fore the mono-rail gets a fair chance with
them. But in Australia if the cost of alter-
ing to uniform gauges is set against the
cost of scrapping stock, it brings the subject
to the doorstep of practical nolitics. And
of course if the thing was fixed in the near
future, the discarded double-rail stock
needn’t be thrown away. There are plenty
of countries that would gladly pay a fair
price for decent second-hand stuff.
“U.S.”: To the surprise of the public,
Dowie’s Zion is back in its former quarters
at the Melbourne Guild Hall. To be sure it
does not occupy the whole of that big edifice,
which had “Zion” painted on the walls in
letters about 15ft. high, when Dowie and
Voliva, with their wives, were flashing about
the Collins-street Block in a stylish landau
with a pair of spanking horses and a liveried
coachman. Emigrants for Zion drove about
Melbourne in four-horse drags, and the New
Jerusalem was just round the corner. The
modest resurrected Melbourne branch only
has what is named the little Guild Hall,
while pictures rampage in the other. Yet
Elder Smith, who is in charge, does not de-
spair of blooming into the whole shop again
and flaunting the 15-foot sign once more. He
is strictly under the control of our acquaint-
ance, Overseer Voliva, the present Napoleon
of Zion city. Voliva is a business prophet,
and doesn’t dress up in purple wings, or pro-
fess to be able to fly and to be a re-incarna-
tion of him who gave back-chat to Jezebel.
The reverence for poor cranky Dowie is Very
curious, as shown in the Zion newspaper,
Leaves of Healing —so called because you
leave without being healed. You can believe
him to be the Tishbite, if you like. Meanwhile
Voliva has a good sound job in hand. Zion
never was the sort of Eden that Scadder
orated about to Chuzzlewit, junior. It is
on the west fringe of Lake Michigan, half-
way between Chicago and Milwaukee, and
is just one of America’s hundred of fairly
prosperous young cities. I am sure the
Hebrews are behind it, as Voliva strictly
keeps up the Dowie regulations against
Pork, as well as Alcohol and Doctors.
There is a proposal to introduce a naval
and military display into the reopening o
St. James’s Pro-Cathedral, Melbourne, which
shaky edifice has been shifted from its
original site in Little Collins-street to a
position further west. Seems that the in-
auguration of Divine service in Melbourne
historic tabernacle was a function with con-
siderable military swank about it. The
idea is to repeat the original ceremony on
up-to-date lines. But how about the naval
element? There is no Bible authority for
assembling Jack Tar on church parade. The
God of Battles was always present at land
engagements when anybody’s hosts needed
putting to the sword, but He never, nevei
went to sea.
A Victorian man has invented an allegedly
simple method of sterilising milk and othei
foods by means of oxygen, and Dr. Bull,
director of the bacteriological laboratory at
Melbourne Uni. reports (1) ''that milk
treated by the process, though exposed in
open jugs, remains sweet for weeks, (2)
that it does away with the necessity for
cold storage, and (3) that its general appli-
cation “would mean the entire stamping out
of milk-born epidemic infective diseases.
The peaceful milk jug is often as dangerous
as a bomb, and a cheap and easy way of
taming the wild contents is about the nicest
present any scientist could give a country.
But presumably even the oxygen process
won’t keep the fly (plain and blow-) out
of the milk, likewise the bee, wasp, cock-
roach, beetle, mosquito, cat, dog, small boy
and dust-storm.
“C.S.G.”: The partners in the firm of
Brown and Smith were champion Wowsers.
Neither could gaze without a blush on such
a thing as undraped statuary, and the sight
of the brown girls surf-bathing at Bondi has
on several occasions rooted them to the spot
with horror, the horror lasting each time for
hours. In fact, they were models of moral
rectitude, and object-lessons to evildoers.
But one day, when the sun shone with
extraordinary brightness and the sparrows
twittered merrily on the telegraph wires,
Smith felt some strange emotion impelling
him to hitherto undreamed-of deeds. As
the day wore on the feeling became stronger,
and at four o’clock he felt an irresistible temp-
tation to kiss the pretty typist. From four
to five he wrestled with fear as to what his
virtuous partner would say should he ever
know he’d dreamed of such a thing. Aghast
at his own wickedness, Smith considered
the horror and shock such a thing would be
.to Brown. At 5.30, throwing prudence to
the winds, and tip-toeing into the outer
office, where the pretty typist clicked away
alone, Smith crept behind her and im-
printed a passionate kiss on the lobe of her
left ear —and then awaited the deluge. But
she only said: “You again, Mr. Brown!”

“In the middle of the morning,” when you
feel that you need a stimulant —a refresher,
something to “put you over” till lunch time
—a glass of the famous Chateau Tanunda
Three Star Brandy in soda will give you new
life, new action, more energy.
OLD Brandy will absolutely have this effect,
and Chateau Tanunda Brandy IS OLD
Brandy—aged and mellowed by time, and
guaranteed so by the Australian Govern-
ment.
Its purity also is testified to by the Govern-
ment, whose officials personally supervise the
bottling and labelling.
No imported brandy is so guaranteed, and
no imported brandy is guaranteed to be dis-
tilled from pure GRAPE Wine.
Moreover, Chateau Tanunda is cheaper than
imported brandy, because it does not carry
the heavy duties levied on the imported
spirit.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Inter-State Commission doesn’t seem
big enough for its job—the job being of an
almost incredible size. Consider its position
or plight. Seventy applications have been
heard so far. They concern one State alone,
and there is no likelihood of any decisions
being reached thereon this year. As there
are 407 applications for more Protection
already sent in throughout the Common-
wealth, and as more are coming in daily, it
looks as though it might be from six to 10
years before a Protective tariff is finally
constructed. And long before then the con-
ditions will have so changed that the whole
business will have to be started afresh. There
are also the differential railway rates and
the export duties problem to be dealt with.
The British Government has struck a
patch of feebleness and disgrace from which
it is never likely to recover. A number
of officers resigned their commissions, with
the lofty statement that they wouldn’t serve
against the rebels of Belfast. A bad-tem-
pered Government would have court-mar-
tialled the lot. A cold, proud Government
would have told them they could go and get
work, and that it was glad of a chance to
put younger men in their places. War
Minister Seely did neither of these things.
He implored them to come back to their
uniforms and emoluments, and gave the
principal disturber, Brigadier-General
Gough, a written assurance that he and his
friends need not do anything they didn’t feel
inclined for. Possibly the navy also doesn’t
require to shoot unless it feels that way—•
that is to say, for instance, that it won’t
be expected to fire at an Asiatic enemy in
our quarrel if some of the officers don’t hap-
pen to approve of the White Australia idea.
This opens up large prospects, for many of
Britain’s voluntary warriors have been
accustomed to be served by black and yellow
attendants, dressers and boot-cleaners; and
have no sympathy with any white policy
whatsoever.
A MATTER OF POLITICAL DIGNITY.
In the opinion of Geo. Black, M.L.A. of
N.S.W., “the only course for the Govern-
ment to follow is to go on borrowing as long
as the country is able to bear the burden.”
But—Great Scott! —the story was that the
burden was to bear the country! The debt
was to be reproductive! It was to “develop
the great natural resources!” The Labor
policy was to expend loan money only on
works that would pay full interest and 1
per cent, sinking fund, so that in 50 years
or so the debt would be paid off and the
public works would be clear profit, and
everybody could have free boots and beer.
If the State is deliberately hunting round in
the loan market for burdens it suggests an
ass going round in search of a walloping and
a ton of bricks to carry.
Having decided to let the expensive Goul-
burn levees go to ruin and throw £120,000
worth of permanent and reproductive debt
to the bottom of the river, Victoria’s Govern-
ment is about to do ditto with the still more
costly Maffra beet sugar experiment. The
trouble with this undertaking was that it
could never get enough beet. Dairying and
stock raising pay equally well and are less
trouble. Latterly the Government has
planted settlers on 40-acre blocks at Ivil-
many Park and Boisdale, a condition in all
cases being that 10 of the 40 acres were to
he cultivated with beet. Now “pressure has
been brought to bear on the. Ministry to
induce it to remove this condition.” So at
the end of the present season the big beet
sugar factory will he closed, and the placid
calm of a grazing paddock will pervade the
industry and the locality. The debt, of
course, will remain, but that is Posterity’s
affair.
The “Solemn League and Covenant” signed
by Carson’s supporters in the rebel half of
Ulster is one of those documents in which
religious fervor struggles with the ordinary
rules of composition, and wins in the first
round. It consists of four sentences, the first
being a breathless and badly-punctuated out-
pouring of 138 words. There are three other
sentences, but that overwhelming outburst
obscures all the rest. It is a pity that the
excited half of Ulster didn’t select a different
name for its pledge. The really famous
Solemn League and Covenant started its
tempestuous existence in Greyfriars kirk-
yard, Edinburgh, in 1638, and though it led
to years of war and turmoil it was at least
a dignified old document which proved to
have armies behind it. Until the new publi-
cation justifies its pomp and style on the
battlefield it might he better to call it simply
a memorandum.
COMMONWEALTH BIBLE HISTORY.
THE LIBERAL ASS. (to Balaam Cook): “Humph!
You'd better get down, Joe. There’s a
hangel in the path.”
From The Bulletin’s tame fanatic : —-
The eastern fragment of Ulster, which is making
all the present Irish trouble, has supplied a good
deal of history. His Majesty’s Plantation of Ulster
was largely composed of brigands and cow-stealers
from the Scoto-English border, whom James I.
exiled in the days when he tried to unite the king-
doms of England and Scotland, and called the
border districts the Middle Shires in the hope of
obliterating the ancient boundaries. A very wise
and learned, but dirty, cowardly and bow-legged
man, was James I. History has scoffed at him
because he was always, hard-up, because he
had to borrow a pair of silk stockings in which
to receive the Spanish ambassador, also because his
tongue was too large, and when he drank, which
happened frequently, the liquor flowed back into the
cup at each side of his mouth. He drank “very
uncomely,” according to a historian of the time.
When he endeavored to unite England and Scotland
he was 100 years ahead of his age. Though he
made a strange noise with his soup (or broth) he
had large ideas about the reconstruction of Ireland,
but he didn’t live to carry them out. The gangs of
highway robbers and sundries whom he sent to
Ulster were left to run loose, and led a bad life.
They adopted Orangeism and other follies. They got
swelled head. They went in for rebellion about
1798, but got out early, and left their brethren in
the lurch. They were poor soldiers, but at scalping,
mutilation and torture they did fairly well. Some
of them devised a scheme for dethroning and, if
necessary, murdering the young Queen Victoria, so
that their boss Orangeman, the Duke of Cumber-
land, might climb on the throne. This caused
recrimination, and for quite a while after that epi-
sode Orangeism W&s an unlawful superstition. Now
it has risen again, with much anger and pride, and
wants to run the Empire from Belfast.
THE TURNING OF THE WORM.
Are the British people losing that ingrained
respect for constituted authority which has hitherto
been the secret of their remarkable capacity for self-
government? —Sydney Telegraph.
JOHN WILLIAM LARKIN ROBESPIERRE BLOGGS
a typical Britisher of to-day—who may at
any moment —as a crowning act of emancipation
trample on his top-hat and tear his side-
whiskers out by the roots.
It has been discovered that King O’Malley,
the very loud imported Federal politician
with the hat that made him look like a mos-
quito sheltering under a mushroom, ran this
country into a bill for £575 for photographs
of himself, assisted by a few other people,
laying the _ foundation-stone of the Aus-
tralian capital at Dryberra. There have
been two men with astonishing hats in
Federal politics—Knox, whose tile was a
blot and a nightmare, and O’Malley, whose
headgear was partly a bushfire and partly a
Mexican upheaval, with a faint suggestion of
the recent Bulgarian war. They were both
unsatisfactory. Still O’Malley was amusing
and Knox wasn’t.
Misguided enthusiasm, like
charity, ought to begin at home.
Orangeman Snowball, of Melbourne,
and his tribe hint at an intention
to supply troops from Australia to
prevent Ireland getting a modified
form of local self-government, yet
they have apparently never thought
of raising an army to abolish local
self-government in Australia. In
fact, a certain Snowball of Mel-
bourne —Oswald Robinson Snow-
ball, to wit —is a member of the
local Home Rule Legislature, and
seems quite satisfied with himself.
Why should not that Legislature
be put down, and Robinson Snowball be put
in gaol, as Parnell was, on a general charge
of sedition and undermining the empire?
An absolutely savage howl about the back-
wardness and procrastination of N.S.W.
trains was the send-off which fell to the lot
of Railway Commissioner Johnson, and the
system which he left behind him grows more
disrespected every day. Speight (Victoria),
Tait (Victoria) and Johnson (N.S.W.)
were three imported Railway Commissioners
who arrived amid great glory and left with
none so stony-broke as to do a bob-curtsey
when they quitted the scene. Johnson had
an especial chance, because certain of the
Sydney dailies —maddened perhaps by
Oliver’s opposition to free carriage of news-
papers by rail and special newspaper trains
—hailed him as the incoming brass god.
They were apparently resolved to see nothing
but good in Johnson. The S. M. Herald
even declared, before its brass god arrived,
that the best remedy for the tangle in the
State Lands Department was to put it under
the control of “a man like Mr. Johnson.” '
Yet the Herald threw no special bouquet
after its hero. Rather it joined in the
clamor about the trains which got lost on
the way, and when the great smash at
Exeter gave a sort of final advertisement to
the Johnson system, it didn’t reprint any
of the gorgeous old narratives. And Sydney
Telegraph speaks quite severely re the
N.S.W. railway service. Incidentally the
Telegraph is importing its own Johnson —-
that is to say, it is importing a new English
editor named Braham. Whether he will
bring any better luck than Speight and
Tait and Johnson the future will tell.
“G.V.W.” : The rumor that “Pro-
fessor” Mills, from Milwaukee
(U.S.), is going to scrape the mud
of Maoriland off his boots
gets some support from a
paragraph written by himself in
the M.L. Worker. It is there
stated that he will not again apply
for the job of national Labor or-
ganiser, and that the work he
undertook to accomplish is finished.
If Mills is referring to the forma-
tion of a united and powerful Labor
combination in Maoriland, then his
assertion is unconvincing. Mills,
like Tregear, has discovered that
the task of uniting the Arbitration
section with the “to-Hell-with-all-
agreements” crowd is impossible.
One stands for order, success, good
conditions and good wages. The
other aims at general upheaval and
stoppage, without much regard for
what may come after. Its theory
is that one man is as good as an-
other, and a darned sight better. It
wants more work and a great deal
less of it. It is difficult to organise
because as soon as its organiser
starts to organise it says he is a
bloated tyrant and oppressor. This
small but deafening assemblage
seems to have made “Professor”
Mills feel hopeless. ' So appar-
ently the “Professor” will profess
not much longer.
“Herman Hogg”: One objection
to the N.S.W. Millions Club is
that it seems too full of city property
agents. And one objection to the
Town-planning Association is that it
has no visible urgent desire to go out
and plan big new towns at the deep water
ports where great, profitable State-owned
cities are possible. Rather it hangs about
Sydney and talks to little purpose about
repairs which would cost more money than
anybody knows how to raise. In fact, it
seems to be a Theoretical Town Patching
Association which toils to no purpose at
sewing a new fluff or tag on to an old slum.
The Victorian State Lands Department
has discovered that the dirt or earth or real
estate along the Yarra, where the new Haw-
thorn to Heidelberg drive is to run, is held
under an old title which stipulates that the
owners must at any time hand over, free of
cost, land required for public purposes. This
should be right up against those speculators
who have been buying Yarra lands lately,
with a view to recouping themselves for their
foresight or thrift or whatever they call it.
However, it is plain that the said speculators
aren’t going to be prejudiced. The land

line is held under the same title, but “the
Government has no intention of claiming, its
full rights. It takes the view,” says Minister
Hagelthorn, “that reasonable compensation
should be paid to all owners part of whose
property was utilised for the work. The
proviso in the title would strengthen the
hands of the Government and prevent ex-
cessive claims being submitted.” Of
course a Watt Government wouldn’t
annoy a landowner for the world. It
wouldn’t even ask him to carry out his con-
tract, though no doubt he got his land very
much cheaper on account of that very pro-
viso in the title.

BILIOUS HEADACHES.
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS A
RELIABLE REMEDY, SAYS RO
ZELLE LADY.
“That dreadful complaint, biliousness, and
its forerunner, bilious headaches, was mv
trouble for some time,” writes Mrs. Ettie
%
"V *4<gtA ;
wjzvrau) i
Ivocass, of 12 Red
Lion Street, Rozelle,
N.S.W. “I saw Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root
Pills advertised for
biliousness, as a re-
liable remedy, and
decided to give them
a trial, after almost
despairing for relief.
Having tried so
many medicines
‘without result, I
was glad to find
Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills sqj good
they dispelled my
attack. I seldom
feel the old symp-
toms of biliousness
now, but keep the pills in my home for self,
husband and family. I can say Indian Root
Pills assist one to make condition, and I
usually enjoy this state of health. You
may use this for publication.”
Probably there is no complaint so com-
mon as bilious attacks. Men, women and
children are subject to them, and while they
last life is made miserable. They are ac-
companied by sick headaches. The liver is
not doing its duty. That is the cause, and
as soon as the liver receives the proper
assistance the digestive organs move along
smoothly again. For this complaint Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills are unrivalled.
.They get at the cause, which is the liver.*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
With the close of the 12tli round of Sydney
First-Grade Cricket competition, on Saturday last,
all interest practically died. The round ended to
the accompaniment of a tornado, a deluge and a
burst of splendid sunshine. When the deluge struck
the various grounds, University was so far ahead
that it was impossible for Central Cumberland and
Gordon, which are running neck-and-neek, to overtake
the fleeing Students. Glebe, when last seen, was
hovering on the horizon, but with small chance of
getting off it. This will be University’s third spell
in the premiership, the other occasions being the
seasons of 1909-10 and 1911-12. Saturday’s finishes
were not spectacular. University slew Itedfern for
180, and then drew with 102 for six wickets.
Gordon, with eight wickets fallen for 70, overthrew
Waverley (67 and four for 90) by three runs on the
first innings. Western Suburbs opposed Glebe, but
as it took the latter two afternoons, owing to storm
interruptions, to get six Western wickets down for
174, and Glebe therefore never had a chance to bat,
the game was declared drawn. To the unsophisti-
cated it would appear as the father of a hiding;
but the rules of cricket are weird. Balmain dis-
missed Middle Harbor for 81, then put 138 on the
board, and tried to rush the Harbor through the
bonemill. The Harbor hung on too well, and made
12 without losing a stick; so Balmain had to be
content with a first-innings win by 67. Paddington
biffed 172, and North Sydney replied with 123 for
SI , X- T , So honors were even. Sydney had a day out
at Petershams expense. It smote the backbone of
its victim for 64, and then heaped up 135 for five
sticks, and thus won by five wickets and 81 runs on
the first innings. The star batsman of the after-
noon was Von Der Ileyde, of North Sydney, who
6av e d his side by putting up 70 (n o.). Pratten, of
n estern Suburbs, did excellent service to his club
by hitting up 55. Coffey, of Sydney, belted 50 on
to the scoring-board. The fact that the 46 of
Davis in AVaverley’s second innings had no effect on
the game did not detract in any way from the
merit of the performance. The only bowling worthy
of mention was that of Gee, of Middle Harbor, who
took three Balmain sticks for 27.
H. B Whitta, the Canterbury and M.L.
re P* cri cketer, has put up a great record in grade
matches at Christchurch this season. He captains
Kiccarton s first-grade team, and in eight journeys
to the wicket he gave birth to 737 runs. His best
effort was 207 (n. 0.). and his worst 31. In seven
completed innings his average was 105.28.
* * * *
Opportunity is everything. Don Hamil-
ton a cricketer of Southland (M.L.), has earned the
distinction of being the most expensive field on
record. Six years ago, at Invercargill, he dropped
a baby catch from Armstrong’s first ball, and the
big man from Melbourne biffed 334, not out. The
other week, on the same ground, Hamilton dropped
another soft one from Trumper, when the latter had
made only 16. Victor banged 211 before he gave
another chance. So Hamilton is hugging the very
doubtful honor of having presented two Australian
teams with 529 runs between them.
* * * *
Finance is a sordid thing, and the mone-
tary history of the amateur branches of football as
generally understood, around the Ma capital last
year, is sorry reading. The N.S AV. Rugby Union
expended £541 and received £261 in return, and,
to the rule of three, that was a loss of
i-I o ' ,P unn £ the same period the (Sydnev) Metro-
politan Rugby Union went £l2B towards the dogs,
the Australian Rules crowd dropped £l7l
down the cracks during the sea'son. AVliat
the Soccer crowd lost, or if it lost any-
thing, is not known. The Soccer crowd knows how
to keep its mouth shut and its balance-sheet under
lock and key. All the various branches place the
blame at every door but the right one. Small-pox is
the c.nef scapegoat, but small-pox doesn’t seem to be
the least worried at the hostile demonstration. Of
course, the real cause is the growth of the alleged
Professional Rugby League. Last year this burly
infant had a turnover of £20,928, and although the
Maoriland tour dropped £529 and the Queensland
picnic cost £302 of good capital, it came out with
a heavenly devil of a surplus. The plain, brutal
truth is that the public no longer drops its elusive
bob into the amateur’s plate, but hurls it at the
alleged professional crowd, which, it reckons, gives
better value for the money. As before remarked, it’s
a sordid world.

to 1902. Smith first made a name at King’s School,
and afterwards in the country. His brother, F. Bede
Smith, was a member of the Wallabies in 1908, and
abo played for Australia in Maoriland and in
Sydney.

Most of the Vic. hoofball clubs have
already begun training operations. That Westralia
intends to have a bigger say than heretofore at
the inter state carnival in Sydney, in August, is
shown by its eagerness in collaring rising Victorian
bailers. Over a dozen of last season’s heftiest bog-
gers-m have been granted transfers thither, while
more are asking for them. Victoria’s ’bailers, by
the way, are forming a Mutual Benefit Society or
trade Protection Ass., or something of the sort. Its
ostensible obiects are to provide retiring allowances
and sick and accident benefits for the players. In
view of the fact that the players already annex five-
sixths of what the public pays, it is not easy to
see where any additional funds are to come from.
Also, it may be noted in passing, that the clubs
already look after injured players, while some pro-
vide retiring allowances as well. Being of a dour
and suspicious habit of thought, this writer pri-
vately opines that the new organisation will be
liaWe when it gets strong enough, to come to a
horrible under,standing” with itself, and then pro-
ceed to enforce its claims by a “strike.” The afore-
said writer only hopes it does. Nothing will bring
home to the average worker the amazing folly and
the blast]ferous annoyance of a “strike” quicker than
the sudden and total cessation of the pastime at
which it is his chiefest joy to barrack.

As the opening of the Sydney football
season approaches the air grows thicker with rumors
of Rugby Union men crossing over to the ranks of
the bloated and plutocratic League. If half the
stories told are true the League practically has
the pick of the Union players, and the Union has
degenerated into a mere training ground for the
League. The players in the League Rep. matches
last season divided £506 Bs. 4d. among them—and
the bait is too much for the average Union player.
The Union remedy, of course, is to go one better;
but, apparently, the Union is too conservative to do
that. So it will stay a mere training ground.
N.S.W. Amateur Athletic Association finds
itself in a deeper financial hole that it expected over
the visit of the Yankee team. The coin paid out
amounted to £352, and the public response was so
meagre that the Association dropped £l9l. Consid-
ering the championships the Yankees got away with
and the void in the cash bag, the Association has
fared badly.

Last year there were nine lacrosse teams
raging around the Ma Capital. But the council
desires quality more than quantity, so this year there
will be only eight. Financial considerations resultant
on the projected visit of a Queensland team and
the vamoosing of a crowd to Maoriland, are respon-
sible for the waving of the pruning knife. Anyhow,
nine clubs meant a bye, which is a fraud and a
snare and a delusion. The game will probably be
better for the reduction.

On April 9 there will be an interesting
affair at the Olympia Stadium (Newtown, Sydney),
when Shima, the Jap, meets W. A. Hill for the jiu-
.litsu championship of Australia. Jiu-jitsu is a
deadly thing if practised in the altogether, but at a
conference of the principals it was agreed to elimi-
nate the “all-in” section of the game. The match
will be divided into seven 6rnin. rounds, with 3min.
intervals. Pleasantries eliminated are eye-gouging,
toe-breaking and chopping from a strangle-hold.
The Australasian cycling team now in
Prance will make its d6but on Easter Sunday, when
Kirkham, Munro, Snell, Piercey and Bell will start
in the 166 miles Paris-lioubaix race. Munro recently
wrote Harry James, of Dunlop fame, that the team
felt the infernal cold very much, but was doing good
road work, and rapidlv improving and even getting
acclimatised. The trainer was keeping them to low
gears and after the 88in. and 90in. gears they were
accustomed to in Australia the inconvenience nearly
broke their hearts. The team is hardly likely to
be fit for the Roubaix event, but it is hoping to put
up a good showing and make a fair impression on
the Gallic public. When racing through villages, the
streets of which are usually paved with rough blue-
stone blocks, the French riders slip into the gutters
and adroitly lift their machines on to the footpath
without dismounting, and continue on the side path
till the good road resumes. Piercey thought what
a Gaul could do an Australian was a cert for. So he
did it—and smashed his machine.

What a marvel American cycle-speed mer-
chant Frank Kramer is. For 13 years he has been
right at the top of the tree, and seems to ride better
to-day than ever he did. Lately he went across to
France to put in a Parisian season, and he com-
menced proceedings by defeating Friol, the Gallic
champion, in three heats. The second one was dis-
allowed because Kramer bored too near his opponent;
so the third was run off, and ended as the others
had done.

The chief trouble with motorists in this
country is to get rid of. heat. Most of our cars are
designed for much colder countries than Australia,
and the result is that a radiator large enough for the
U.S A., England or Continental Europe is altogether
too small for Australia. The various clubs should
communicate with the manufacturers and make stren-
uous representations. F. W. Lanchester, the English
expert who discovered that wire wheels were easier
on tyres than any other type, has now come forward
to declare that the fact is not due to the greater
resiliency of the wire wheel, but to the fact that it
sheds the heat much more quickly and effectively
owing to the direct contact of the air with the rim
surface and the conductivity of the spokes and spoke-
nipples, which adds to the effective cooling surface.
And that is in England. How much more so must
it be in Australia in the climatic conditions under
which the recent Melbourne-Sydney Reliability Test
was held?

The gentleman who blows in casually to
collect free drinks and sell photographs of himself at
fancy prices because he is walking round the
world for a wager made with Silas P. Gogg, of Syra-
cuse (Ga.), or Pember Q. Brown, of Burlington (Me.),
will in future cut Prussia out of his beat. Kaiser
Bill, or Bugman-Holwegg, or somebody, has got
suddenly tired of the fraud, and the walking blighter,
immediately he sets foot in Prussia, will be either
chased back across the frontier or run in as a
nuisance. It is time we did something similar in
Australia. Considering how far Australia is out of
the direct track round the world, it has been
visited bj' quite an army of these dreary humbugs;
most of whom have walked from the nearest decent
pubbed suburb into Sydney, Melbourne or Perth.
Many of them have had a good time at other people’s
expense, and have started to walk to Cape York,
amidst great enthusiasm and sad farewells, in a
somewhat inebriated state. They started from Syd-
ney or Melbourne or Adelaide, and their last known
address was any place—Gosford or Footscray or
Gawler. After that a great silence swallowed them
up, owing, presumably, to them having been killed
and eaten by the “Indians” in Brown’s bar at Cow
Creek. The cannibalistic practices of the Aus-
tralian Indians around Brown’s bar are well known.
There will be a great scatter of Trotting
Stock at Ashburton (M.L.), April 11, when H. F.
Nicoll, one of the best-known followers of the sport
in Maoriland, will go out of the game. The whole of
the horses bred and got together by him will pass
under the hammer, including the famous Rothschild—
probably the greatest trotting sire Australasia has
known.

The Australian Jockey Club (N.S.W.) is
again on the delightful job of scattering largesse,
and announces for the 1914-15 season that £BO,OOO
will be thrown on to the racecourse to be picked
up by owners. This is an increase of £9250, as
compared with the preceding year, and the sum
total is a ponderous heap of wealth to be thrown
into the ring for one sport. But the A.J.C. is coin-
ing so much boodle that it must throw some of it
somewhere, or be smothered by it.

The Longworths are a very hefty swim-
ming crowd. Champion “Billy” is already a host in
himself over most distances, and last week little
brother Dick pushed into the game and grabbed the
100yds. Great Public Schools Championship in
66sec., and the 50yds. Open Championship in 27
l-ssec. On the same day a certain N. Longworth,
which may be either Nathaniel, or Norman, or Nick
Nogsworthy, won a couple of junior championships.
By the look of things, for some years to come,
anyone wishing to have a look at any N.S.W. State
swimming championships has only to drop round to
the Longworth family mansion.

The Adelaide tennis tournaments were
enlivened by the presence of Rice, H. A. Parker and
Utz, from Sydney; Raws and England and a strong
ladies’ contingent from Melbourne; and Ernest
Parker, from Perth. The last named, holding the
title of Australian champion at present, was out of
health and out of form. Rice beat the two Parkers
in turn, and in the final put down Roy Taylor, S.A.
champion, by three to two. The loser, volleying
brilliantly, looked the better player, but his ten-
dency to miss easy ones was fatal against a man
who misses nothing. The doubles
were even better contested. Out went
I’ice and Utz, E. Parker and Keane,
H. Parker and Taylor, Raws and
England, and the finalists were all
local men, J. O’Dea and Barritt win*
ning from G. Thomas and the vet-
eran Lang. As it chanced, no two
championships went to one person.
Miss Waxman (V.) was fairly beaten,
though unexpectedly, by Miss Sharp
(S.A.). Mrs. Rowe (S.A.) and Miss
Le Neven (V.) took the doubles;
and the Mixed went to Guy Fisher
(S.A.) and Miss Waxman. There
were record entries in every line But
the striking feature of the week, from
the local point of view, was the
crowd of visitors in spectacles, both
„ J T a, 'J) Keane (W.), England, and
N. Taylor (V.) all being goggled. Adel-
aide is used to seeing Crawford play cricket in
goggles, but hardly expects them on a tenuis court.

The latest rumor about the introduction of
the Tote in N S.W. is that the matter is to be put
to the proof by Joseph Hector Carruthers—he who
is a lot more Joseph than Hector. The ex-Premier
is interested in more than one racecourse club, and it
is whispered that one of these clubs will instal the
machine, because there is nothing in the law against
it, and will leave it to the bookmakers’ union to
take action Then the matter will come before the
Courts in the form of a test case. Presumably, in
the event of defeat, nothing very terrible will happen
to the club; whilst the chances of defeat are very
remote indeed. Another cheerful rumor is that some
people have made money in the past by baulking the
introduction of the machine, and are now demanding
that the parties who hitherto found the cash shall
fix up something substantial in the shape of a sola-
tium, or pension, failing which the parties interested!
may make some pelf by publishing in book or pamph-
let form the history of how the machine has been
kept back in N.S.W. for so many years. In other
words, it is said that they threaten to give themselvesi
away unless they are paid not to.

Tom McCormick, the welter-weight who
lost his recently-acquired championship of the
British Empire to Wells, met another disaster in
Melbourne on Saturday night, when he found himself
up against the Burns protege, Fritz Holland. Hol-
land has an advantage in height and reach, and his,
habit of putting all his body and soul, and his cash
assets and real and portable property, and his domi-
cile and library and furniture and live-stock behind
each punch, is liable to disconcert the other fellow
when the different fellow stops the wallop which the
former fellow aimed at the subsequent fellow. In the
second round McCormick just managed to dodge
one of those right hooks which meant a sudden end
That was when Holland threw all his estate at
Me. In the fifth there was a very fine rally. Hol-
land got McCormick on the rope's, “and blows flew
like autumn leaves, till the latter person battered
the previous person off. But, alas for England,
McCormick’s eye was cut, his nose bleeding, and
signs of wear, tear and depreciation of capital value
stuck out all over him. Quite a lot of his reserve
fund had to be written off. Holland banged away
merrily at the injured eye; and presently he had
McCormick’s mouth bleeding by means of uppercuts.
Hereabouts the Yankee mobilised his forces and
started a heavy bombardment of the body. McCor-
mick commenced to look like a person who had
backed the wrong horse. The American was inclined
to hold and hit, and referee Marre warned him that
caper must stop. Holland was looking for the
crowning glory of a knock-out, but the gritty Eng-
lishman stuck to his guns, or rather his fists, and
slogged away to the finish. Marre pronounced the
only possible verdict, and then went home to bed.
On Saturday night, at Sydney Stadium,
Arthur Pelkey, another of the Burns kennel, will
smite ancient warrior Bill Lang. Lang’s daring and
his insatiable hunger for wallop and general tribu-
lation suggest that he is a direct descendant of the
early Christian martyrs, who were never happy
except when they were up against lions.
* * * *
Sydney Stadium saw another brief battle
on Saturday night when Milburn Saylor, of America,
outed the English boxer Nat Williams in one round
and 20sec. Weights announced made Savior the
lighter—9st. SJlb. to William's 9st. 12 Jib. The
opening round saw Williams display superior skill.
He parried Saylor very prettily, and showed fine
footwork. Saylor threw his wild swings about in
characteristic style, but Williams cleverly boxed him,
and once shot home a beautiful counter that made
Saylor think something important in the firmament
had burst. Towards the end of the round, however,
at close-quarters Saylor suddenly drew back, and
bending over swung a right for the base of Wil-
liams’6 skull. Had the glove landed it would pro-
bably have done but little harm, but the aim, like
most of Saylor’s shooting, being very wild indeed,
it was the bony side of the bare arm that smote
Williams like a brick and practically knocked all
the ringcraft out of him. He went to his corner in
a very shaken condition, and when he came out for
the second period he was still badly dazed. He
attacked Saylor, which was what Saylor desired,
and that person again got AVilliams on the back of
the neck, this time with the heel of the glove and
the wrist. Williams went down on to his knees,
but instead of taking his time scrambled up and
staggered towards his opponent. Saylor met him
with a perfectly measured right uppercut (which
proved that the gentleman can measure his blows
sometimes). This collision almost lifted Williams
off his axis, and sent him to the floor and out. The
crowd’s sympathies were all with the fallen boxer,
and it cheered him again and again as he was helped
from the ring.
Saylor got the decision, but writer is far from
satisfied that he should have done so. Had this scribe
been referee Saylor would have been outed on a foul
—unintentional, of course, but none the less a foul.
To begin with, writer has a recollection that the
Boxing Conference held at the Hotel Australia some
months ago barred the occipital blow. But even if
the blow is legal, the smash that dazed Williams in
the first round was not a blow with the glove but
with the bony part of Saylor’s arm. The second rab-
bit blow that completed the physical demoralisation
was not struck with the knuckles either, but with
the heel of the palm and the wrist where there is no
padding on the glove. So it came to this, that Wil-
liams was fighting with gloved fists and Saylor with
raw bone and leather-covered flesh, with no padding:
between the leather and the fist. All of which is not
only unequal but against the rules. It is only a
question of time till Saylor either kills someone or
shatters the bones of his forearm or fist. He is a
great natural fighter, but his method of fighting Is
too reckless and too dangerous. He would be a
charming supporter in a rough-up, but the Stadium
contests are glove combats and not rough-ups. Say-
lor should be made to box. At present he fights the
same sort of battle one would expect an untaught
gorilla to put up. Talking of gorillas, Saylor has a
most simian-like reach. He has also the strength of
a very large ape, and his body movements are remi-
niscent of those usually attributed to our far-back
ancestors. This simian likeness ends right there,
however, for, as regards his top-piece, Saylor is a
good-looking boy with an intelligent head and a fine
eye. All the same, it is time his pole-axe blow was
barred.
* * * *
Owing to Saturday night’s fight ending so
suddenly the Stadium management, to give the public
what the public considered its money’s worth, let
loose a pair of substitutes in Regio and Burns.
Burns, a hard-working sort of fighter, was somewhat
too fat. Regio looked all right and proceeded to
delight the audience by a wild-cat display. He got
all over the hard-working Burns, who seemed pain-
fully slow, and bashed him very badly, and then
skirled away out of reach as Burns proceeded to hit
back. But then Burns developed a habit of trying
to counter, and once he caught Regio under the chin
just as that gentleman started to retreat. For about
three. rounds after that Regio put up a magnificent
exposition of a flying corpse. Too groggy to hit, too
evasive to be knocked out, his boiler absolutely
burst, he jigged round the ring, keeping out of the
way of the axe with which Burns chased him. Then
he came back, and when he had Burns half-way
through the ropes, proceeded to knock saucepans and
j Devil out of him. Burns got back into the ring
and the hurried Regio looped the loop, and when
Burns ducked Regio hit the floor with all his might
and weight, amidst the wildest applause and
laughter ever heard in the Stadium. It was great
tun—for the onlookers. At the end Harold Baker,
with a cynical smile, declared it a draw, and there
was more wild laughter and applause—for Harold's
diplomacy. But a draw wasn’t the beginning ol a
name for the thing. It was a joke or a howler, or
perhaps a Spoonerism.


MY HEALTH EXERCISES
PERMANENTLY CURE INDIGESTION.
Indigestion is NOT caused by the food you
cat. It is purely the result of a stomach
that has been ill-used —that has been shame-
fully neglected—that has been allowed to
rust, through want of exercise.
Very few people overeat. If the muscles
of the stomach are of normal strength, your
food will give you every particle of its nour-
ishing qualities.
My Health Exercises, for banishing indi-
gestion. quickly build up and strengthen the
muscles which govern the stomach —make
them easily able to assimilate the food—give
nourishment to every part of the body. Be
guided by the experience of others who’ve
benefited.
Read these excellent reports:—
“Your exercises have done me a lot of good.
I feel much stronger in every way, and get
better health. I used to suffer from indi-
gestion, but have not been troubled for some
time now.”—J.R.K., Wallendbeen, N.S.W.
“Those last lot of exercises have banished
all the aches and pains of. indigestion, of
which I had a terribly bad attack the week
before I received your last letter.”

THE CREAM OF MODERN BEAUTY
ADVICE.
“ Wavy ” Shampoos.
“Homely Hints.”
Few people know that stallax can be used as a
shampoo and is far better than anything else for
the purpose. It seems to have a natural affinity for
the hair, leaving it very glossy, fluffy and with a
pronounced natural “wave.” A teaspoonful of
stallax granules, dissolved in a cup of hot water,
is more than sufficient. Genuine stallax comes to
the chemist only in sealed tins, a quantity sufficient
to make up twenty-five or thirty separate shampoos.
The indescribable lustre it imparts to the hair is
quite inimitable. ** * For an actual hair grower
bothing equals pure boraniuin. It is quite harmless,
and sets the hair roots tingling with new life.
* * * The use of rouge is almost always obvious, but
powdered colliandum gives a perfectly natural color
and defies detection.
Oxygen to Remove
Bad Complexions.
“Useful Hints.”
Oxygen has the peculiar faculty of destroying waste
matter in the body without affecting healthy tissues
in the slightest degree. Sallow, blotchy and lifeless
complexions are caused by the accumulation of waste
matter which adheres stubbornly to the surface of
the skin. The most practical way to apply oxygen
to this waste matter is to use mercolizcd wax, such
as may be obtained at the chemist shops. It should
be rubbed well into the skin for several nights and
washed off in the mornings, like cold cream. In
contact with the skin, it releases oxygen, and thus
clears the skin of the disfiguring waste matter. It
is perfectly harmless, pleasant to use and indeed
very beneficial as a skin food. * * * To bring a nat-
ural red color to the lips, rub them with a soft
stick of prolactum. * * * For tired, hot and perspir-
ing feet use a teaspoonful of powdered onalite in a
foot bath.
Effectually Killing
Superfluous Hair.
“.Health and Beauty.”
Many women know how to remove ugly growths of
superfluous hair temporarily, but few know how to
remove it permanently. For this purpose pure pow-
dered pheminol may be used. Get about an ounce
from your chemist and apply a little directly to the
objectionable hair. The purpose of the recommended
treatment is not merely to remove the superfluous
hair instantly, but also to kill the hair roots com-
pletely in a comparatively short time. * * * Women
who are annoyed by body or perspiration odors will
appreciate the hint that a light dusting with pow-
dered (white) pergol occasionally is an instantane-
ous corrective. ** * For oily complexion smart
women are now using the natural allaeite of
orange blossoms as a greaseless cream. It holds
powder perfectly, gives the face a cool, fresh ap-
pearance which lasts, and it does not encourage
growth of hair on the face.
Home=Made Beauty.
“Cosy-Corner Chats.”
The very simplest things are often the most effec-
tive in making a woman beautiful. For instance,
few people know that a dull or greasy complexion
ean be instantly brought to a pretty, youthful,
natural bloom merely by the application of ordinary
cleminite dissolved in water. Moreover, the method
cannot be detected even under the closest scrutiny.
The result will last all day long and requires no
powdering even under the most trying conditions
indoors or out. If you have no cleminite in the
house get about an ounce from the chemist’s and add
only enough water to dissolve it. Apply a little to
the face. It is good for the skin and immediately
produces that cool, velvety, natural “bloom” so
much desired. * * * To make the eyelashes grow long,
dark and 'curly, apply a little mennaline with the
finger tips occasionally. It is absolutely harmless
ami beautifies the eyebrows as well. *"* * Pilenta
soap is the most satisfactory for all complexions. It
even works well in cold or hard water.

“Hamer”: The station bookkeeper holds one of the
most mixed jobs in the world already, and now it is
proposed to add to his burdens by making' him the
wireless operator in those homesteads where the Mar-
coni arrangement is installed. There are many big
runs where the bookkeeper is also the storekeeper,
the butcher and the postmaster. He is likewise, if
he is up to the job, and there happen to be children
at the homestead, the tutor, and the society enter-
tainer. He has to do his share of solid graft with
the men, the only difference being that, while some of
them have special jobs to attend' to, he jobs all over
the place, and everything comes his way except abun-
dant remuneration. He is ex-officio medical adviser to
the station, and if he isn’t a bit of a vet. his value
is at a discount. He writes letters for some of the
men, and he takes their measurements when they
want to order suits from the metropolis. Usually
he has a last somewhere, at which he does a little
boot repairing; and an extra accomplishment is fre-
quently tinkering. It seems a lot for a wage of very
little per annum, but there is no union of Handy
Men or association of Generally Usefuls.

“Wharfie”: In his look round for ways to raise
money Premier Holman has stumbled to the fact
that, outside Sydney, wharfage rates in N.S.W. are
practically unknown. Tonnage and harbor dues are
collected at Newcastle to a limited extent, but north
and south nothing of any kind is collected, despite
the faet that tons of money have been lavished on
dredging, wharfs, breakwaters, training walls, cranes,
etc. These public works are used to great advantage
by the North Coast and South Coast Shipping Cos.,
who, so far from paying anything towards meeting
the interest charges are continually howling for more
dredges, more breakwaters, more everything. Mean-
while, all freights and fares fall into the ready paw
of the shipping owners. Realising these things,
Holman threatens a Harbor Rate Bill this session.
If the Bill passes and a serious attempt is made to
collect the rates there is going to he some hysterics
from the river ports up and down the coast. It was
in 1880 that Parltes first passed the Wharfage Act,
but vested interests were enabled to engineer a suffi-
cient number of proclamations to make the Act a
dead letter. A similar scheme won’t be so easy to
work in 1914, and the only hope the crowd inter-
ested has is to prevent the Bill passing. And that
ought to be steep proposition.

“Swan”: The old-time phrenologist who manipu-
lated and interpreted the cranial protuberances and
calliosities on the skulls of his subjects for a cash
consideration has badly slumped before the competi-
tion of the palmist. The trusting citizen, hungering
to ascertain his bent in life, no longer submits his
dome of consideration to the exploratory skill of the
long-haired professor with cold fingers and a hacking
cough. He now visits Madame Pompadour, and per-
mits that shoddy party to investigate his “line of
life,” and his “Mount of Jupiter,” and greedily
drinks in her astounding deductions concerning the
uncertain gee-gee for the Derbv or the Cup, or her
revelations regarding the female with auburn locks
who is panting to throw herself like an avalanche
on his shirt-front and overwhelm his stud. Mary
Ann, the cook, likewise riotously expends her hard-
earned savings, made out of the back-door sale of
bottles and fat, in discovering the secret intentions
of the “bloke” she walks with casual. And Mrs.
Starvem, who runs a cheap boardinghouse, dis-
covers, for 2s. 6d., that certain lines in her horny
palm indicate that Robinson, who left owing three
months’ board, has no intention of remembering the
obligation. The ass who holds out her hoof for the
revelation of the future is eternal and faileth not.
And the frowsy female who hangs out her prophetic
shingle is sure of a golden crust if she is sufficiently
plausible for her job.

The Los Angeles (U.S.) water-supply scheme repre-
sents one of the biggest business blunders on record'.
The fluid was dragged over 200 miles to the city
at a cost of nearly £5,000,000 before the analysts
found that it was just plain Epsom salts, and hence
useless. The pollution arises from the fact that the
river from which the supply comes runs through
an alkaline desert. No aldermen have been hanged
or even shot to date, but that omission should be
repaired in time. It is apposite to recall, just here,
that it was a Yankee mayor who was never able to
distinguish between the works of Omar Khayyam arid
Hunyadi Janos.
THE COMING PROBLEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Scaddan Government's borrowings for last year
ran to £ll ss. per head. The Holman Government,
as a borrower, easily beats all previous records.
—Recent comments.
’Twas all very well in days gone by to gibe at the
Tory crew,
The jobs it did and the jobs it hid, its trips to the
London Jew ;
“It feathered its nest,” was the cry we raised, and
much of the cry was true,
And strong were we in the faith we had and hope
in the Party New.
The Party New —it was thus we talked —would take
up a manly stand —
Would scorn to cocker the aliens’ trade or go with
its cap in hand,
To bow and beg like a poodle pup that’s out for a
greasy bone
At Hebrew wicket and banker’s gate: “We come for
a nice new loan!”
The morning rose, and the Party New came in with
a noble chance,
And tee peeped out with a sanguine smile to look
at the land’s advance ;
And if so be as a Tory sneered: “Now, where is
your march sublime?”
We bade him bide for the turning tide, and just give
a party time.
I dreamt last night that Moses woke in Yid-ridden
London town—
“l hear a knock at the door,” he said, “vould
bring a per-shentage down.
Ye get no shleep in our Hebrew beds since Labor
is Sydney’s king.
It’s ‘Millions, millions, Ikey Mo,’ the song that they
always sing.
“I thought, von time, they came it strong, mine
Friends of the House of Fat;
But, Lord ! they didn't know half the game—those
men of the Lofty Hat!
Their ragin’ foes who are down on Ycalth and drove
’em in fight pell-mell
Can leather ’em easily inside out at raising the
vind as well.
“It’s borrow a bit to build a line, and borrow a
trifle more
To boost the failing revenue up and help to a safer
shore;
It’s borrow to beat the record queer that Fat in the
past has shown ;
Then borrow again vith a thirst insane to cheerfully
beat our own!”
The Hebrew gasped as he oped his door and bellowed
a “Six per slient. !
Mein Gott —you don’t mean to tell me, boys, that all
of the last is shpentf”
And I—l woke from the dream I dreamt—a dream
that I felt was true,
And said: “On what does the Future lean—-if this
is the Party New ?”

The “Lazy” Tropics.
Dear Bulletin, —The folk who believe that
a white man in the tropics withers up, loses
his punch, and abandons everything except a
seat under a punkah and a brandy-peg, have
got several hits in their controversial solar
plexus in quite recent years. One is the
sudden rise of the productive capacity and
the wealth of the Southern States of the
U.S., following on the abandonment of the
fallacy that the nigger had to work while
the white man looked on. Another is the
development of tropical Africa by white
men, and of South America by Europeans
who have killed the prevailing stagnation
arising out of the colored labor ideal. Two
big schemes of recent years will give the
measure of the success of the policy of a
working white man who no longer lazily
watches the slow nigger, but gets up and
does things himself with a hustle which is
good for his liver and his bank account. In
the very hottest part of Occidental Africa
the French have planned and built a model
city called Koulonba. It is the capital of
the French Soudan. The best features of
modern town planning and architectural
beautification are to be found in this new
city—a spacious plan, splendid public build-
ings surrounded by gardens, fine official
structures, beautiful residential villas, and
on the hills near by a sanitorium which cost
£200,000, comprising a dozen separate pavi-
lions. There are bustle and go in these
streets, lively business by the virile white
man who has converted himself from the
belief that he cannot work on hot days.
Again, we find in the tropical State of
Minas Geraes, in Brazil, an official capital
city which was built in three years at a
cost of over £10,000,000. As the old capital
got too small and could not expand owing to
the mountainous surroundings, the worn-out
and anaemic white man in the tropics started
to build anew one. For those who are in-
terested in the gradual methods of the Can-
berra builders, it is worthy to note that this
city was so rapidly thrown together by the
effete South Americans that in 27 months
after its beginning the Government was
lodged in the departmental palaces, there
was a complete electric light, and trams
were running through the splendid boule-
vards. The population had risen last year
to 30,000 people. The name of the new
city is Bello Horizonte. It is described by a
French writer as a “city built in an almost
deserted spot in which an active, fruitful
and prosperous life has been developed,”
This doesn’t look as if the tropical condi-
tions have diminished the virility of the
white-skinned man in South America, or
forced him to sit about drinking the whisky
of the country under a fan while the nigger
or Indian did the work of the community.
The idea seems to he coming round that if
the white man, when he gets into the tropics,
would drink less and work more he would be
healthy, wealthy and not a complete and
boundless ass. Perhaps some of those
Frenchmen from burning Africa or South
Americans from tropical Mines Geraes might
supply ideas regarding the reconstruction of
Sydney.—Yours etc..

The Scoffer of Canterbury.
An essay on Party Government: —
One Whitsitt, M.H.A. in Tasmania, maddened
probably by the impossibility of pronouncing his
own name without making a whistling noise, lately
promised his support to Labor provided Labor pro-
duced a programme to suit him. So, bar accidents,
the deadlock will end, and instead of 15 members on
each side the numbers will be 14 and 16, and the
Solomon Ministry is presumably dead. Nobody
seriously suspects the man with the name like a
burst cushion of any permanent or strenuous sym-
pathy with Labor, but he has, apparently, fallen out
with Solomon. Besides, as the one man who has
done a break-away, he holds the balance of power;
he can make or unmake Ministries ; he can demand
that the policy of the new Government shall be sub-
mitted for his individual inspection; and in a
general way he is a Dictator for the moment, and
his tail is greatly exalted.
In fact, he occupies the position which that other
Tasmanian, Cameron, once did in Federal politics.
Parties were evenly divided except for Cameron,
and the fate of the Labor Ministry of the hour hung
in the balance. So Cameron went away to see his
bedridden uncle or something, and neglected to say
which side he was on, and watched from a distance
the spectacle of the censure debate being strung out
from day to day pending his return. Then he came
back, and rising in the House, attired in a shape-
less qoat and a look of pride, he declared himself,
and the Labor Government wr t down, and, inci-
dentally, Cameron's importance died right there. He
wasn’t offered even the smell of a portfolio.
Then he got back into Tasmanian State politics,
and in the amazing game of Party Government he
got another chance to be the man in the middle, and
to make and unmake Ministers. Tasmania was so
full of joy over Cameron that it appointed him to
the job of ex-member, which he held ever after-
wards.
Now Joshua Thomas Hoskins Whitsitt inherits
the other man’s discarded macintosh of prophecy,
and dictates in his stead. With a simple system of
Elective Ministries, each holding office for the life of
a Parliament, there would be very little chance for
people like Cameron and Whitsitt to stand around
with undue pomp and dignity making Governments, but
the Party system leads to strange devices. If the same
idea of having one crowd to do things and another to
prevent things being done, were carried into other
branches of industry, strange devices would follow
there also. For instance, there would be, as at
present, an Archbishop of Canterbury, with a big
salary and a palace, to maintain the dignity of the
Anglican Church; and in addition there would be a
stipendiary Scoffer of Canterbury, also with a salary
and a palace, to cast mud on that dignity, and dis-
parage the Church. They would cadge in the usual way
for votes and support, and, when the Scoffer acquired a
majority in Convocation, he would become Arch-
bishop, while the Archbishop would descend to the
humbler but less responsible position of Scoffer.
Under these conditions there would be great excite-
ment, and much joy would arise in public-houses, and
the parson of the Infidel Church —if there is such a
person—would enjoy food for comment. But it is
very doubtful if the Anglican faith would profit
much.
All the same, this writer holds that the scheme
should be tried. It might lead to that good which
comes out of evil. If the Scoffer of Canterbury
didn’t show up the foolishness of the Party Govern-
ment system, no other person or institution would
do so.

Well, we, some two years ago, took on a Sole Agency, calling for an enormous output, and to live
up to it we decided to offer diamonds at merely a broker’s commission above cutters’ landed cost.
The first year it did not pan out too well; the second year the very large output told, and so we
are continuing the experiment for another year. ,
We only sell the higher grades of diamonds, but our prices are lower than those of London.

IN BANANA LAND
“Rangan” : Two more well-known Banana-
landers have answered the last call —Port-
master Captain Mackay and pastoralist Nor-
ton. Mackay came to Australia 60 years
ago, and during his many wanderings he led
an exploring party from the New England
tableland to the Burdekin, discovering the
fine sugar country of Mackay. The party
had more hardships than even the average
early exploration parties, and only just
pulled through. Later, Mackay went back
to the sea (.whence he came), and traded
much in the Pacific. In 1882 he was enticed
back to Queensland by a promise of a grant
of 1000 acres of Mackay land. A change of
Government, however, annulled the grant,
and next year Mackay took on the port-
mastership of Cooktown. From there he
drifted to the biggest job in his line in the
State. He was 75 when he moved on to the
Promised Land. The other departed, Nor-
ton, was an Australian, and went on the
lgnd at the age of 16. After many ups and
downs he finally made good. He was a keen
politician and held the Ministership of
Works, and the Speakership in Bananaland’s
Assembly. Being thrown down at the polls
to the House of Fat. He
hardly -managed to survive his 78tli year,
af-teV a tremendous battle with the devastat-
ing jclimate.
Soap.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An immense combine is being formed with the
object of supplying China with soap. Capital,
£30,000,000. — Recent cable item.
Ye nations hark! A new millennium breaks
And Sin of China flings his gyves away ;
llis pigtail' from his bullet-head he shakes,
And bids a welcome to the dawning day,
And while his neighbors breathe his name
with hope
His millions cry exultant: “Send us Soap!”
The filth of Ages lies upon his rags,
The mud of aeons crusted on his skin ;
Alluvial clogs his spacious trouser bags
And lines the nails of either horny fin ;
And grime, historic grime, eternally
Obscures the text of gracious Kon-fu-tye.
Why is’t that warring factions waste his
land
And tread his priceless heirlooms in the
dust?
Why is’t he’s robbed by each barbarian band
And sees his children prey to Vandal lust?
Is’t not that hoarded dirt of ages clogs him
And that the mire of centuries fairly bogs
him?
He’s lopped that ancient Mantchu dynasty
And all the grievous growths that clung
about it;
In ashes lies that fallen monarchy
And China gets on mighty well without
it;
Yet Sin’s convinced —unless he wash her
cleaner —
These changes only make her look the
meaner.
Behold! by leaping brook and babbling rill
How prattling babe and dam and toilsome
father
Bend down and wash away with joyful will
And splash each other with abundant
lather;
And, as they whiter wax and. therefore wiser
Give back to earth a peerless fertiliser.
No wonder Yang-tse runs and lloang-Ho
In yellower flood to yonder girdling ocean;
When millions shed their dirt —an overflow
Of deeper dye must needs be set in
motion.
And doubtless watching Japs are waxing
jealous
At this new notion of those Chinese fellows.
Soap—soap —Thrice blessed word —’tis thou
wilt save
These saffron millions from the true per-
dition
That overtakes the folk that will not lave
And lets the mud of ages cloud its vision,
And leaves in flakes upon its epidermis
The stuff that should be useful where the
worm is.
How will the great historians yet record —
“In Nineteen Fourteen dawned an era
gracious,
When once again the Yellow People scored
And opened up a vista new and spacious;
Took proudly place among the nations hope-
ful.
Washed almost white, erect and free, and
Soapful!”
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, March 28, 1914.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The chief event of this exceedingly wet
week was the bestowal by Governor Mac-
gregor of the order of St. Michael and St.
George upon Railway Commissioner Evans
in the Exhibition Hall. The citizens made it a
double event, by handing up to him a cheque
(which blushed unseen in a leather wallet),
an illuminated or incandescent address, as
well as a diamond pendant for Mrs. Evans.
His Ex. donned his very genteelest rags, to
wit, his Windsor uniform, and with his staff
in their bespangled trappings and the
Mayor in his rabbit-skin dolman, I can
assure you, Thargomindah, it was a real
thrippenny picture show. The speeches were
of the usual laudatory nature. The, Mac-
gregor, “Bob” Philp and the Mayor all
harped upon the fact that Evans commenced
at the lowest rung of the ladder, and while
the ladder-climber himself didn’t seem to
mind the allusion a bit, daughter Maude
did not appear too conspicuously pleased
about it. Anyhow, she refrained from leap-
ing on an Austrian chair and calling for
A NATURAL MISUNDERSTANDING.
OBSERVANT STRANGER (on a visit to Mas Congested Capital and wailing to shift his
baggage): “Aren't there any taxis here?”
SAD SYDNEIAN : “Taxes? My oath, Mister! W'y, we're hist gettin’ about full up
of 'em! ”
three cheers. After all the speechifying,
people fell upon the afternoon tea, which stood
at bay upon small tables around the hall.
A ton or so of it was reprieved, as the
wretchedly wet weather diminished the ex-
pected guests by about three-fourths.
On Monday last Home Sec. Appel went
to the Queensland Women’s Electoral League
meeting and gave those present a little talk
about the new Electoral Act. With more
or less breathless awe the ladies listened to
his lucid explanation of some of the knotty
points in the Act, and gushing votes of
thanks were accorded him by the grateful
congregation.
The Brisbane Women’s Club, which now
boasts a membership of over 120, met again
last week after the Christmas recess.. They
are a strenuous and soulful Ibty atfd the
syllabus for the coming year includes debat&s
on such moot points as, “Should. Women
enter Parliament?” “Should Amusements be
Taxed?” “Why Women should take an
Interest in Politics.” Also papers by differ-
ent members who have M.Sc., M.A. and
B.A. tacked after their names are scheduled.
Sundry ponderous men, too, are going to
give lectures to the women, which is a fair
thing, seeing the lectures they've got to take.
Our “fighting parson” from the West, Rev.
Hulton Sams, is moving Britainward, and
the folks out Longreach way have given
him a travelling kit and a case of seven
razors. Why seven? He is an excellent sample
of the good Christian, with a Bible in his
boxing glove, and we all hope he is coming
back to Queensland. He is not beloved by
Snuffle and Co., but he is a real sport.
Maud Allan, the dancer, pirouetted ashore
little city to-day from the Ivumano
Maru and stayed a few hours —long enough
to remark that Australia seemed a very wet
place. She spent a day at Townsville, and
it poured in torrents all the time, and now
Brisbane was likewise enduring a deluge.
She has a slight American accent, delightful
blue eyes, and looks like a Greek statue in a
tailor gown. Do you get that?
Mrs. Deardon (Hamilton) left on
Wednesday by the Canberra for Melbourne,
where she will be the guest of Mrs. Geoffrey
Syme. We are very proud of having such
a shining literary light living in our toniest
suburb, for of course you know that she is
Kathleen Watson, whose “Litanies of Life”
were so much read some years ago. She
has just published “Later Litanies,” and
they are full of that delicate charm and
refinement which characterised her earlier
work. She is a delightfully witty, jolly
woman also, which so many clever women
are not.
Last Tuesday night the Lady Lamington
Hospital for Womein, a charity which is the
pet child of many of our Society tonnages,
was to have received a benefit at the
Dandies show. Record booking had taken
place, but so did a record deluge, and the
entertainment had to be postponed until
April 6.
Our vaudeville caterer, Mr. Ted Holland,
with Mrs. 11. and son Claude, have just
come back from your brimful city, and Bris-
bane is thrilled by the glad tidings that
Master Holland won a prize for tango danc-
ing. The tango teas have not arrived here
'yet.
.Some of our enterprising young men,
with Alan Corrie at their head, have formed
themselves into a company called “The Bris-
bane Roller Rink Co., Ltd.,” and fixed up a
really good floor on the old rink in South
Brisbane, that used to be known as the
Glideway. Last Thursday they issued afiout
1000 or so invitations. But —it rained,
with the same old damp, wet rain.
Yours in a sodden spirit and goloshes,
Australia Jane.
Another posthumous honor. Excellency
Macgregor informed Brisbaneites at the
Evans presentation that had Commiss.
Thallon lived he also would have received a
mark of royal favor. It will soon be neces-
sary to inscribe on certain tombstones:
“Would have been a C.M.G. had he not
departed.”
“A.P.F.”: Died at Humpybong (Q.) on
March 22, William Henry Jackson, once a
partner in the big drapery firm of Finney,
Isles and Co. —which has been one of the
biggest firms in Brisbane for 40 or 50 years.
Finney, Isles and Jackson were brothers-in-
law. Miss Jackson married Ormond Smith
—who is one of the powerful Howard Smith
clan. Jackson was a kindly North of Ire-
land man, who liked farming better than
fashionable rag-trading. He pulled out of
the firm, about 20 years ago, with a few
thousands, and bought Morayfiejd, on the
North Coast line, an historic place where
sugar, rum and Kanakas were cultivated in
the very early days.
Norris G. Bell, Chief Engineer for Queens-
land Railways, having been offered a sim-
ilar job on the Commonwealth lines, didn’t
lose much time in deciding that £lBOO a year
is more than £1250. Bell began life as a
Scotchman, which may happen to anybody,
lie reached Queensland in ’B6, and began
half-way up the ladder —as a district
engineer up north (Commissioner Evans,
by the way, commenced as a porter). It is
expected that Bell’s spanner—or whatever
his emblem of office is—will be handed on to
R. E. Sexton, the deputy chief.
Minister Paget recently bragged that
Queensland had more miles of railway to
every 10,000 people than any other country
in the world. Premier Scott, of Saskat-
chewan, while in Brisbane, told Queens-
landers that his State had three times as
many people to every mile of railway, as
Queensland, and that Saskatchewan’s popu-
lation was increasing faster than that of any
other province of the Canadian Dominion.
After all, there was more sense in boasting
(as Scott did) than in vaunting, like Paget,
that your country had less people to the mile
of rail than any other land —thus advertis-
ing the weakness of the State and its fitness
for conquest. A country void of population
and packed with ready-made railways should
be a prize for someone.
Milk adulteration is rife in Southern
Queensland. Certain Toowoomba lacteal
sophisticators raised the plea recently in de-
fence that, the milk inspectors had made
their purchase on Sunday, consequently the
sale was not legal and no offence had been
committed. Some day a question will arise
as to whether it is lawful for the cow to be
alive on Sunday. Shouldn’t it die on Saturday
night and resurrect on Monday?
The N.S.W. Income Tax Bill was ruled
out by a friendly and reluctant Speaker on
the ground that it was muddled to an extent
that exceeded the rules of the House. The
Bill for imposing a super-land-tax went the
same road, for the same reason. This is a
pretty bad record for a short session. Hol-
man, Premier, Treasurer and barrister, when
he tries to put in legal form certain matters
that he has been advocating all his political
life, shouldn’t make quite such a hash of
events.
“Melb’s” forecast: The author of the Mel-
bourne bomb outrage will never be dis-
covered. No crime with any element of
mystery ever is unravelled by the Melbourne
Farce. The Bauer murder, the Fitzroy mur-
der, the Vaucluse (Richmond) outrage, and
a heap of others are witnesses to the verity
of the above axiom. The most appropriate
emblem for the Vic. Hop is Lethe, the river
of forgetfulness. The public can’t remember
more than one outrage at a time, so when a
fresh horror transpires the incompetent old
Farce gets a sort of general absolution as
regards the preceding ones.
Some folk are a humorless crowd. Robert
Best, who is a dry, serious man, the other
day introduced to the Victorian Minister for
Railways a deputation from the Y.W.C.A.
and the Girls’ Friendly Society. It desired
that notices should be pasted up at railway
stations warning girls against “strange men
and women.” This is a good idea in its
way, for almost everybody should be warned
against most people, but why not have
notices warning young Haybag from the
country against strange girls ? Solomon wrote
bitterly about the woman in loud raiment
who waited for old Haybag’s child at street
corners. Bret Harte told in verse about the
downfall of Milton Perkins, “late an owner
in White Pine.” Seeing that the girl is per-
mitted to commit perjury” against Haybag
fils with impunity; and he mav be flogged
or imprisoned or hanged on very slender
evidence for “leading her astray,” while she
may get away with all his assets almost un-
questioned, it seems that the harmless young
lout with the budding whiskers and the
bird’s nest in his hair deserves consideration.

Bottle=fed
Babies
How often little, bottle-fed
babies suffer from weak-
ness, anaemia, rickets and
teething troubles. Yet a
little SCOTT’S Emulsion,
added to the contents of
the bottle, will build up
the weakest child, will en-
rich the blood, renew the
strength and make that
child healthy, sturdy and
strong ; and, at t~e same
time, genuine SCOTT’S
will strengthen the lungs
to resist coughs, colds, bron-
chitis, and all throat and
chest ailments. Start baby
on SCOTT’S to-day—but be
sure to get SCOTT’S with
the fishman on the package.

Thirty years of assiduous study of The Hair and its Treatment, and all

of J reserving the Hair, and producing a new growth, after all other preparations
have failed.
Mi’. 1' red Peakman, of Wairoa, New Zealand, is another wonderful case. Ilis hairdresser tells me
he had not a scrap of hair, and now, after a few months’ treatment with my preparations, he has
got a splendid growth of hair.
Mr. O’ltourke, Wee Waa, New South Wales, writes: “My head, which was nearly bald, has now
come back to its usual growth.”
Sutherland states: “I had only a little down on my head when I commenced to use your
SPECIAL PARASLNE and COSMO LOTION ; now I have a beautiful head of hair.”
Gentlemen who are going bald should use Special Parasene and Cosmo Lotion, one at
night and the other in the morning, and wash the head once a week with Shanipuna.

Wairima: You are over tlie odds for
plain, blank stupidity. Tlie story ran that Hamfat
measured up the area cleared, paid (reluctantly) for
the area according to his measurements, and was then
proudly and fatuously told by Mrs. Hamfat that she
had cut a section olf the tape measure, and had thus
swindled the workers. The story stopped there. The
rage of Hamfat, the way he explained to Mrs. Ham-
fat that it was he who had been swindled, the way
he walloped Mrs. Hamfat, the night that she spent
in tears, the early hour at which she rose and cleaned
Hamfat’s boots in her nightdress as a sign of contri-
tion, and the special egg which she cooked for his
breakfast by way of holding out the olive-branch of
peace-—all these things were left to your imagination.
And, being a weary, timbery old cuss, you haven’t
any imagination. ...R.S. (or R.T.) : Received your
letter (no address, and signature lacking) with re-
marks to the effect that we obviously dare not (your
italics) publish your letters, and that you are “the
only Australian with brains and patriotism com-
bined.” Sorry we can’t remember you or locate you.
Don’t recall your letters. Can’t even find the evi-
dence that you are the only brainy and patriotic
Australian, but will have an earnest search made
for' brains among the manuscript on hand. Mean-
while, if you are really the only patriotic Australian,
the accountant will pay you £i()0 to go on with. . . .
Servus Publiea: The fairest and most legible writing
that we have seen these many years ; but the point
in your first par., re the Melbourne motor-’buses out-

ago; and the second one refers to “cleansing the
Aegean stable.” We are sick of that particular
stable even when it is spelt aright. .. .Fisho: If a
par. of yours appeared, cut it out, post it to the
accountant, this office, and payment will follow as

bitter curses. ~vJ.G. (Patea, M.L.) : Thanks ; send the

it was legible. Yet -. . . .Sunbeam: There must be

Jacob II.: You want her so! And you are going to
get her! You. say so yourself. Then what are you

abyss, because the point was so small that it couldn’t
hang itself on it. . . .L.S.: Line after line your poem
rises up like an exhausted camel and falls down, and
rises up again and falls down; but there is nothing

(Scotland) : You’d better be told now. It is color-
less verse, and we have an idea that colorless verse
is your only line. In future, you’d better send
stamps or a notification that you don’t want them
back. We don’t want them forward. .. .W.G.: You
will not be able to sell them at a reasonable price
to us. No price would be-reasonable for such mer-
chandise. .. .G.G. (M.L): You have missed the topi-
cal motor- bus by weeks. Astonishing how soon such
things become history and moulder and are for-
gotten. And then they wake, again, as relics or
cuneiform inscriptions among the ruins of Babvlon.

Also on Neck and Body, Sore and
Disfiguring, Cuticura Soap and
Ointment Cured in Two Months.
186 William St., Darlinghurst, N. S. W.
—“I have been troubled with pimples and
blackheads of a hard and sore nature for
three years, on the face and neck and body.
They were sore as well as disfiguring. I
tried many medicines for the removal of
the trouble, but with no result until I was
advised to try Cuticura Soap and Ointment,
the result being successful. I used the Cu-
ticura Ointment on retiring at night, after
washing with hot water and Cuticura Soap,
by applying it gently to the affected part
with the tip #" the finger, kept it on all
night and washed it in the morning with
hot water and Cuticura Soap.
“The cure took about two months, i
think Cuticura Ointment is the finest skin
healer there is on the market.” (Signed)
W. H. Lennon, November, 1912.
ECZEMA BEGAN ON ANKLE
Port Germein, S. A.—“My little daughter
suffered with eczema which began with a
little spot on the ankl6 and gradually spread
up her leg. This made her very irritable
and caused disfigurement to the affected
part. We tried various remedies but with-
out any success for about two months, then
I got some Cuticura Ointment and used it
along with the Cuticura Soap as directed,
which cured her completely and she has
been well ever since.” (Signed) Mrs.
Adelaide Haines, October, 1912.
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment

is often sufficient. Liberal sample of each

all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easv to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, or younger years.

of the scalp. It is the only remedy for the
hair ever discovered that is similar to the
natural hair foods or liquids of the scalp.
It penetrates the pores quickly, and the
hair soon shovvs the effects of its wonder-
fully exhilarating and life-producing quali-
tiesi
Besides being a True Hair Grower, my
preparation quickly removes DANDRUFF,
and stops FALLING HAIR and ITCHING.
It is known the world over, and I have in
my consulting-rooms upwards of 3000 grate-
ful letters from men and women who have
derived so much benefit from the use of my
True Hair Grower as to compel them to
write and thank me.

Adelaide \ ‘‘The absence of Oscar Dickman in
Adelaide (5.A.) ,, (B. 26/2/’l4). When the sporting
editor is tired of his job in Sydney (N.S.W.), I
can guarantee him one in this town. The above-
cited line shows him to be the most conscientious
journalist in Australia, (S)outliern (H)emisphere.
A scrap of ancient Inky Way:—
Sir, * said Dr. J-hns-n, “we had, to-day, the
story of Belshazzar s Feast. .. .This, for a sermon
always seems to me the most childish.
“Take, for instance, that part—the principal part
—which deals with the inscription upon the wall.
....Now, sir, I ask you, how is it within the com-
pass of any man’s imagination to believe that the
Almighty could write such a villainous hand as that
nobody of the whole of that assemblage was able to
decipher its meaning? Sir, it would not have
passed at a board sehbol....
“And, sir, there must have /been many wise men
present from Chaldee, from China, from Baluchistan,
from New York, from Pelargonium, and so on.
“The only alternative is that Belshazzar himself
(saving he was blind) was too drunk, or too igno-
rant, to make sense of the writing Nobody else
would dare to do it for him.”
B-sw-11: “Sir, here was a case in which it had
been folly to be wise....A man might easily get
into hot water.”
J-hns-n: “Into a blast furnace, more like!”
B-sw-11: “Aye, indeed, sir.”
J-hns-n: “All the same, it was a mighty undignified
thing.... to scribble upon the wall.. Sir, it argues
ill-breeding!”
B-sw-11: “There was one man could read it.”
J-hns-n: “Daniel, sir, was a vain, eocked-up Jew;
he saw much incidental glory in the matter.”
B-sw-11: “Yet he did interpret.”
J-hns-n: “Nay, sir; he invented a falsehood, and,
on that account, was thrown into the Liars’ Den.”
B-sw-11: “Sir. My Bible says a Lions’ Den”....
J-hns-n: “Sir, that is a corrupt reading, and not
in the original translation The fault of some
editor, whose eyes were as bad as Belshazzar’s.”
AN ADMONITORY ODE TO THE (IMPORTED)
NEW EDITOR OF SYDNEY “TELEGRAPH.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
■ Cable advices were received yesterday to the effect
that Mr. D. D. Braham, of London, had accepted
the offer of the editorship of this journal. Dr. F.
\V. Ward resigned some months ago, but will con-
tinue in office until Mr. Braham arrives. Mr. Braham
has arranged to sail by the Otranto on April 24, and
will be due in Sydney on June 4.
Mr. Braham, who was a scholar of New College,
Oxford, passed-from the University to the staff of
the Times, eventually succeeding to the foreign
editorship.— News items.
Hail! honored Brother of the Inky Way,
Who comes with us to stay:
Hail 1 in the names of Ma and Sydney, hail!
And let these fleeting rhymes
Acclaim thee and the Times —
That name which in thy favor turned the scale,
And sends thee here to wield the editorial flail!
Thou comest in unquestionable shape;
And we are all agape
To see the mighty works thou shalt perform.
Yet, haply, it shall be
Of some small use to thee
To know the Chair that Whiskers Ward kept warm—
The chair from which he helped to ride the Borrow-
ing storm !
Alumnus of New College, Oxford, heed!
And thou shalt find, indeed,
Thy tines in pleasant places fallen— and set:
Think not that thou art come
From thy far Northern home
To wean us from our Joss of Endless Debt-
No, no! Aunt ’Tildagraph still clings to that, you
bet I
Essay not, brother, with mild, innocent zeal
To make thy readers feel ,
They are a part of some great whole, outside;
They will but snore, or laugh,
Who read the Telegraph,
And in congested Sydney take their pride;
They know beyond lie wastes where hostile folk
abide i
Well was it that, of all the Times's sub-chairs,
Thou tookest Foreign Affairs!
In Auntie's office thou wilt be at home:
That venerable dame
Gives honor and high fame
To all who live and move across the foam,
And equal homage pays to London and .to Rome.
Tliou canst not paint the foreigner too bright
In Aunt Matilda's sight,
Nor rate too high his wisdom and his worth;
See that due court be paid
To England’s God, Freetrade —-
Who (thou shalt swear) will yet rule all the earth;
But let Protection be fit subject for thy mirth.
Oh, reverence LOANS! They are the final word
Our statesmanship has heard.
LOANS are like Love’s sweet tale, so old —so new!
And Aunt has always preached
To those her voice has reached
That this State’s saviour is the Three-Ball Jew.
So urge, and blench not though a score of loans fall
due!
But at our infant factories thou mayst tilt,
And sneer at, as thou wilt;
And at our feeble Tariff have thy fling!
Declare as Holy Writ
Australia is but fit
To tear from earth its food-stuffs, and to cling
To foreigners for every manufactured thing!
Remember that Australia must depend,
Until the very end,
On foreign brains to lead it, and reflect
Its genius to the world:
Hence, our best jobs are hurled
At strangers ; this idea some reject,
But, in thee, Auntie proves the theory correct 1
Applaud Imperial politics and praise
All English Labor’s ways ;
Whoop for Lloyd-George, and Asquith’s virtues
boom.
Their taxes are far off!
But let Aunt's heaviest scoff,
And leading articles of deadliest gloom,
Descend on Labor here, that i shes Ma to Doom!
Against signed articles direct thy pen I
Who are newspaper men
That they should dare to let the people know
That all the brightest things—
The cleverest thrusts and stings
Which cause the shams and humbugs so much woe—
Are not the editor’s, although he runs the show 1
Do all these things—or don’t do them —and more;
And thou are bound to score,
Thrice-eminent Brother of the Inky Way 1
Be affable, but wary;
Play up to Randal Carey,
And Watkin Wynne. Give heed to what they say;
For they are business men, and make Aunt 'Tilda
pay!

HUNTER.
(From a Buchner

Rexona Proprietary Company,
SYDNEY.
Dear Sirs,
Like many of my com-
panions in the profession, I
am a strong advocate of
Rexona Ointment and Soap.
Rexona I use for my skin
after my nightly swim and
after any outing in sum-
mer or winter. Also for
any chance cut or abrasion
I may get.
I always use Rexona Soap.
It is perfection itself for
both skin and hair. Using
it I need no dressing for
my hair, which always
keeps soft, shining and
silky. Wishing Rexona
and Rexona Soap always
the success both deserve, I
am,
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) HOPE HUNTER.
Miss Hope Hunter is one of the most beautiful Austra-
lian Show Girls ever seen on the stage. Her sparkling
face, tall and lithesome figure, have been much admired
by the many thousand patrons of the J. C. Williamson
Ltd. Revue, “Come Over Here.” This beautiful and
talented young lady is a firm believer in Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, and Rexona Skin and Facial Soap.
Everybody’s Using It Now!
Rexona Soap and Ointment are universal favorites with everyone who
values a pure and healthy skin. Rexona will at once heal all the minor
injuries to the skin, as well as the more serious ones, and Rexona Soap
protects the user from disease, and insures both health and beauty.

The Great , Harmless Pain-Killer .
UNTIL the advent of Kephaldol there
had been no certain and reliable remedy
for the lumbago sufferer. Those afflicted
know the agony that this complaint can cause
and are only too well acquainted with the
Lumbago
violent symptoms of
which it is charac-
teristic stiffening
of the back —impossibility of making the
slightest movement without absolute agony, en-
forced rest and immobility, etc.
To-day there is no need to continue suffering any
longer. Kephaldol will cure you, positively and
quickly. It relieves almost instantaneously, and
though mild in action is wonderfully quick in results.
This marvellous remedy has the power of acting on
the lumbar nerves at the exact source of the evil. A
couple of doses will give prompt relief, and the remedy
continued will entirely eradicate the symptoms. In
many of the worst cases a few days have been sufficient
to entirely rid the patient of the complaint.
Kephaldol is safe to take in large
or small doses. It does not de-
press the heart nor affect it in any
injurious manner. It is guaran-
teed under the Pure Food Laws of
N.S.W., and is endorsed by thou-
sands of doctors, and used by all
the leading Continental and British
hospitals. Remember it cannot
injure those who use it.
KEPHALDOL is sold by all
Chemists and Storekeepers in
tubes —1/6 and 3/6.
If any difficulty is experienced in
procuring a supply locally, send
postal note or stamps to value of
tube desired, and same will be sent
by return post prepaid.

What the BRITISH
DOCTORS say of its
“ I have tried three tablets of Kephaldol in a
troublesome case of Lumbago, and got relief
very soon after.”—Dr. T. Foley, Youghal.
“ I have pleasure in stating that Kephaldol
was tried in a case of Lumbago with a rapidly
beneficial result.”
—Dr. <l. Johnson, Stoke-on-Trent.
" I beg to report most brUUant results from
Kephaldol in case of (1) Sciatica and (2)
Lumbago.”—Dr. ft. Buttle, Accrington.

VERY NEARLY, AND, ON PRESENT
APPEARANCES, RATHE R-T O O-
PROBABLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CATCHING pale fish from Northern
rocks
The white man dreamt a shining
' dream,
Hp shook his mane of tangled locks
And looked afar across the stream
Of plashing ocean, wintry grey,
Td where the wide, sweet sunlands lay.
His arm was strong, his eye was bright,
He bought an axe and made it keen —
A heavy axe with which to smite
The bolted doors of Might-have-Been;
And then he built a ship with pain
And named the vessel “Start-Again.”
He started in a howling gale,
A howling gale was in his soul,
He heard the new years tell their tale,
He saw the splendor of his goal;
He meant to smash his rugged way
Clean through the walls of Yesterday.
No longer would he scale the fish,
Wrest from lean wolves his breakfast fare,
Or shiver with the frosty wish
To steal the waistcoat of the bear.
Beyond the seas he knew of old
Was wealth of corn and beef and gold.
But larger dreams than gold and beef
Stirred where his whiskers scrubbed his
chest;
Beyond those seas of storm and grief
Were happy valleys rich with rest,
And richer after rest was won
With noble labors to be done.
He dreamt that when his axe was dry
From smiting down his latest foe,
A hundred gates would open lie
To magic paths his feet might know;
Visions of knowledge and delight
Moved him to deeds of gory might.
This was the meaning of his axe.
The page of history declares
The red, wide horror of the tracks
He cut across Creation’s prayers—
The wrecks of death before him hurled
Made a loud shambles of the world.
The terror of his haggard name
On land and ocean made him free,
He grasped his prize through blood and flame
And nursed new nations on his knee ;
Yet, with his conquests at his feet,
tie knew his vision incomplete.
Across dim oceans fled his ships,
tt "^ e . w headland owned him king,
He kissed wide Wonder on the lips
And heard new syren voices sing;
His black, fire-throated heralds blew
Death o’er a continent or two.
And yet in visions of the dawn
He saw his dream of other years,
A splendid lightning ever drawn
By the sharp shining of his spears ;
And o’er the hazes of the deep
He looked for greater fields to reap.
The full years drew the veil aside,
The ocean yielded up its prize,
Earth’s last clear treasure rolling wide
Its bloodless wastes before his eyes ;
He saw, he wondered and he knew
His age-long dream at last come true.
A white man’s land, sun-flooded, free,
Sufficient for his largest need,
The home of those great things to be,
The harvest of his hope and deed!
He veiled his eyes against a light
Too large and dazzling for his sight.
And after that he went to sleep,
And cobwebs on his whiskers grew,
He left the land of browsing sheep
Till “statesmen” sold it to the Jew;
And all his faith and hope and trust
Were smothered in Canberra dust.
N.s.w.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JUST before sunset the gentle
man in the Beaufort suit and straw
boater hat scrambled over the
asylum wall and, after peering round
cautiously, set off down the hill at a steady
trot, as if he intended to keep going for
hours.
Half an hour after he had gone an
angry, red-faced man flung himself over the
wall and rushed off in the wrong direction
at a terrific pace warranted to use him up
in a mile. The asylum cow looked after
him thoughtfully, then waved her tail philo-
sophically and went on grazing. Night
softly fell over the quiet countryside; far
lights twinkled ; and, in the shadowed swamp
at the foot of the hill the frogs set up a
devotional chant.
* * * *
Miles away, close to the roaring, glaring
city an inexperienced waitress, who had
been left in sole charge of a cafe near a
little ferry wharf, cowered nervously behind
the cash register and stared at a gentle
little man who was rapidly peeling and
eating bananas. A great pile of yellow
skins lay alongside his plate, and there were
more skins on the Vienna chair where
rested his absurd straw hat. The girl
watched as if entranced the wizard-like way
in which he disposed of his last fruit
sausage. “That’s four dozen!” she breathed
tremulously. “I won’t let ’im ’ave any
more—’» miadit die!”
And, at that very moment, the little man
gulped down the last mouthful, dropped the
skin on the chair, and cried briskly,
“Another dozen bananas, please!”
The girl turned in a panic to the soft-
drink department and pretended to be ab-
sorbed in rearranging the shelves.
But the little man, not to be denied,
called clearly, “Forward, please! Another
dozen bananas!”
The desperate girl emerged, flushed and
slightly hysterical, from behind the counter.
“You carn’t ’ave no more bernarnas ’ere!”
Her customer looked fearfully astonished.
“No more bananas!” he repeated incredu-
lously.
“That’s wot I sed !”
“And why not, pray?”
“Becos you’ve ’ad too many orready,
that's w’y!”
The little man assumed a terribly digni-
fied air. “Do you mean to say I am not in
a fit state to have any more bananas? Is
that why you refuse to serve me?”
“Yes!”
“But you dare not say that I am intoxi-
cated ! I defy you to say I am under the
influence of bananas!” ,
“I don’t know wot you’re torkin’ erbout!
But I ain’t goin’ ter give you bernarnas till
you fall down an’ ’ave a fit! You pay me
fer th’ four dozen you’ve ’ad orready, or I’ll
call a pleecemun!”
The little man instantly produced gold.
“Do me up four dozen of the best in a strong
bag, and be smart with the change!” As
the girl turned away to fill the order he
added severely, “I have never been treated
like this before. If you are not very careful,
you will lose your banana license.”
Receiving his change and a tremendous
paper sack of fruit, he put on his absurd
straw hat and marched out of the place.
The frightened girl set to and gathered up
the skins. “’E mus’ be barmy !” she chat-
tered to herself. “Torkin’ rot like that an’
eatin’ bernarnas till ’e could ’ardly see outer
’is eyes. Well, ’e deserves ter be took ill.
and, if ’e eats that bagful, ’e will —th’
greedy pig!”
An hour or so later, in an uptown street,
an aged cab-liorse pulled up suddenly and
jerked the driver—a little, red-haired man
—into an ecstasy of rage. “Git outer th’
road, carn’t yet?” he howled.
“Have a banana!” retorted the shadow
who had nearly been walked over.
“Don’ you be too flamin’ smart!”
“WHAT’S UP NOW?” roared the inside
of the stopped cab.
The angry cabman, in the face of this
greater fury, immediately became abject.
“It wasn’t my fault, Mr. Wilson!” he
moaned through the window. “It wasn’t
my fault, sir! Some silly cow just tried to
give th’ ’orse a bernarner!”
The cab was shaken with a big man’s
laughter.
The cabman fidgeted uneasily. “Will I
drive on, sir?”
The cab shook again.
“Will I ?”
“No! Tell that chap to get in !”
The cabman nodded at the shadow and
jerked his thumb contemptuously at the
back of the cab. “You gotter get in!” he
remarked. By his imperious manner, a by-
stander would have inferred that he was the
charioteer of royalty.
The willing little shadow thrust his im-
mense paper bag into the dark vehicle and
climbed in after it. The cab moved slowly
up the street a'nd the morose driver listened
to the bursts of laughter while he drove
carefully in any direction. During a brief
pause, he felt something cold pressed against
liis neck while a happy voice gurgled,
“There’s a banana for you !”
“I don’t want no bernarna!” he protested
vehemently. Then he added: “Where am I
ter drive ter?”
Came the prompt reply, “To Pharaoh
Moses’s second-hand clothes shop—an’ try
an’ get there before th’ cab falls down
dead.”
“Right !’* muttered the cabman viciously.
“I’ll take yer there, an’ if yer roust on me
like yer always do I’ll give yer a bit of me
mind! GIDDAP.”
There was no more astonished man in
Sydney than the red-haired cabman when,
on reaching the desired shop, Wilson got
out, and, telling him to wait, pushed the
little man and his bag of bananas into the
musty place.
“Well, blimey, ’e muster wanted ter go
there! I thought ’e was pullin’ me leg
aein !” He then composed himself to wait.
The proceedings inside the second-hand
shop were of a frenzied and irresponsible
character. The place was partly marine
store, partly theatrical costumier’s, and
partly plain, "old clo’. Wilson and the
attendant Jew took the placid little man in
hand and tried on various cast-off uniforms
Until they had arrayed him in a curious
mixture of American naval officer and Brit-
ish Life Guardsman. His costume con-
sisted of a naval cocked hat, blue frock
coat with epaulettes, white buckskin trou-
sers (these fearfully loose)* enormous knee-
high bodts with spurt; and a sort of Hus-
sar’s cloak. A long cavalry sword was
girded on and an assortment of medals hung
on his chest. Then he was burdened with
a roll of old legal parchments (mostly
leases), decorated with colored ribbons and
seals, which the dealer dredged out of a
boot-trunk. For these absurdities Wilson
wrote out a cheque, which Pharaoh Moses
accepted very doubtfully after various guar-
antees had been given. Then the little man,
his arms full of bananas, old mortgages and
other litter, was hurried out to the cab and
bundled into it, despite the muttered pro-
tests of the driver. “Where to?” be whined.
“To Guv’mint House!” shouted Wilson,
and struggled in after the docile Life Ad-
miral Hussar.
But the cab did not start immediately.
“Look ’ere, Mr. Wilson. I’m not goin’ ter
put meself 1 in th’ way of losin’ me license!
I know there’s a big darnce up at Guv’mint
’Ouse ter-night, an’ I know yflu’ve igot some
joke”
“Drive on,, dammit!” • \ t J
“I ain’t goin’ ter” . I Z
“Oh. drive on!” t *
“GIDDAP!” snarled fh'e, driver help-,"
lessly. The old horse woke with a start and

“WHY AM I ALWAYS ILL?”
There are many people who seem to be always taking - medicine and yet are always ailing.
The reason is this : They do not take the right kind of medicine.
There is no medicine that cures all diseases. It is no use taking a kidnev and
bladder lemedy for constipation, liver complaint or lung troubles, neither is it any good
taking ordinary medicine for kidney and bladder troubles.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are solely for the kidneys and bladder. They do not
interfere with the liver, stomach or bowels; all their healing properties go to the
kidneys and urinary system. They are therefore the best medicine known for uric acid
troubles, dropsy, urinary disorders, over-activity of the bladder, pain in seeking relief,
gravel and stone, pains in the back and loins, rheumatism, lumbago and sciatica, for
these ailments arise from urinary poisons left in the blood by weak kidneys. Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills cleanse and regulate the kidneys and bladder like ordinary
medicines regulate the bowels.

FIFTEEN YEARS CURED.
Mr. William Carroll, Senr., ex-railway guard, 749 Harris Street, Pyrmont,
says : “Some time ago I strained myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon
noticed the effect in the small of my back. For three solid months I was unable
to work. I was laid up. I had a very lame back, and a dull pain through the
loins and the kidneys, and my secretions became unnatural and irregular. I con-
sulted a doctor, who recommended Turkish baths, but though I got a little
ease I could not work. I used Doan’s Backache Kidneys Pills, and obtained
wonderful relief. I am so much better I can now do heavy work. I am firmly
convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are a true kidney remedy, and I
never fail to recommend them among my friends.”
Fifteen years later Mr. Carroll confirms the above: “I have been quite free
of backache and urinary trouble ever since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me fifteen years ago. My cure proves tha:t Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
a thoroughly good remedy.”
FOURTEEN YEARS
CURED.
Mr. Walter Niddrie, George Street, Parramatta, says: “I suffered terribly
with my kidneys. The worst symptoms were backache and rheumatism. Some-
times I would be doubled up with the pain, and unable to do any work. Reading
of a similar case to mine being cured by Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, I got
some, and before I had used them long I was quite free of the pain. Previous
to using the Pills I would often sit down, and it would be fully ten minutes
before I could get up again to a standing position. I was unable to stoop down
to lace my boots in the morning, and my wife would do it for me. I am quite
free of the pains now, and I consider that without Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills I would have had to give up my billet.”
Fourteen years later Mr. Niddrie says: “I have been free of backache ever
since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me fourteen years ago. I never suffer
with my kidneys now, and am in splendid health.”

Inside the gloomy tumbril, Wilson went
carefully over his last instructions to the
obedient escapee. “Remember that you’re
the newly-appointed Colonel of th’ Horse
Marines, and that you’ve bought Guv’mint
House so that his Excellency needn’t move
out at all. As soon as you give th’ deeds
to him th’ band will play ‘God Save th’
King,’ and he’ll make a knight of yer. If
it should slip his mem’ry, remind him in a
loud voice, because there’s bound ter be a
lot of noise, and he mightn’t hear yer. Now
do yer think yer can remember all that?”
The Colonel nodded brightly above his
armful of fruit and rubbish. “Every word
of it, your Grace. And would it be eti-
quette for me to ask him to join me in a
banana?”
“Of course it would! Don’t forget to
ask him —he would be offended if yer
didn’t. By the way, you won't mind me
leavin’ you at the door, will you? I have
to look after that Foreign Office work I told
you about.”
“I shouldn’t dream of keeping you,” said
the Colonel politely.
The lamps at the impressive iron gates
glared whitely, as the cab rolled reluctantly
into the vice-regal precincts and crunched
on the gravel. Wilson swung himself on to
the step and hung there talking earnestly
until the vehicle was within 20 yards of
the entrance. Then he dropped off. saying
loudly, as he did so, “He’ll be nervous for a
cert’nty, so take his arm and rush him in !”
The cab rolled on cumbersomely and left
him, a laughing shadow, in the middle of
the drive.
The vice regal dance was in full swing
and the decorated entrance temporarily de-
nuded of guards. The few tired footmen
about, listening dreamily to the monotonous
music, merely saw a decayed cab drive up
and a gorgeous but somewhat confused uni-
form tumble out of the back of it. The
animated uniform and cocked hat had a
brief, excited argument with the driver and
assisted him somewhat hurriedly to get
down. Then they hurried up the hallway
arm-in-arm. chatting loudly, and were lost
in the crush. Only the cab remained.
In the confusion of a ballroom, filled with
rotating dowagers and people of various
degrees of clumsiness, the only thing that
attracts general notice and stops the show
is sudden death. . So the Colonel of the
Horse Marines whirled the cabman through
the crush unnoticed and unreproved save by
those upon whose toes he stumbled.
“Lemme go, carn’t yer?” sobbed the ter-
rified cabman.
The Colonel, with one lightning move-
ment, transferred the gold-laced cocked hat
from his own head to that of his prisoner,
and clasped him, together with the bananas
and parchments, closer to his medalled chest.
“The time is almost ripe!” he hissed
joyously. “Loyalty must prevail. Only a
little while longer and his Excellency will
clasp me by the hand and make me a baron.
You will be his Master of Horse!” They
trotted a little way and then spun in the
opposite direction.
“Don’t shove —them bernarnas—rso close !
.... I 'ate th’ smell of ’em!”
“His Master of Horse!” puffed the lunatic
proudly. “/ will design your uniform!”
“F’r —Gossake, mate! —let’s get out —
this ’ere place!”
“Calm yourself, dear friend!”
“Where’s—th’ doort”
“Be patient!” counselled the Colonel.
Locked together, they danced ruthlessly
through a flock of nervous society sheep and
came at last to the distinguished end of the
room. And the wild, sweet music rolled on,
drowning common sense and blinding every-
one to the impending outrage.
The little group of personages were just
laboriouslv concluding some of their official
gyrations when the Colonel and the Master
of the Horse emerged from the Crush in a
somewhat frazzled state and skimmed un-
tidily round the outskirts of the distinguished
revel.
The second before the band hit the last
note and the whirling stopped, the watchful
Colonel made his swoop, and, luckily for the
peace of Europe, just missed the Governor
and caught an enormous military man with
a heavy black moustache and scowl to
match.
As the music drained away and the floor
cleared, guests noticed that two characters
in fancy dress had bailed up Major Feeld-
peece, extra A.D.C., and that one of them
was making a humorous speech in a queer,
high-pitched voice: “And I trust your Ex-
cellency will accept these deeds in the name
of every loyalist in the State, and make me
a baron and this gentleman Master of the
Horse. (He is only a cabman at present,
but his charges ar a most reasonable.) Now,
your Excellency, if you will allow me to
present you with these documents and join
me in a really excellent banana”
But the beet-red Major stepped back and
the documents and bananas fell on the ball-
room floor. Then the second scarecrow tore
off its cocked hat and began to shout, in
very bad English, some utterly irrelevant
remarks about cab-driving. Before the
gathering guests could quite catch his drift,
shocked-looked footmen wriggled from all
quarters, and the curious two were swept
towards a side door like so much rubbish,
while the Major stormed at large, and re-
fused to talk sense to anyone but a quiet
personage whom he saluted and was very
humble to. Someone sent an urgent signal
across the floor to the band, and soon the
swing of a waltz was setting the gossipy
crowd waltzing again.
But outside in an anteroom, telephones
were set ringing furiously, and large,
anxious policemen padded about like hungry
lions and listened to two voluble prisoners,
one of whom, in the fullest uniform ever
seen on the premises, gabbled loyalty, while
the other, in severely plain clothes, inquired
plaintively about a certain deserted cab.
And presently _ the telephoning sub-
inspector came in looking rather less
worried and said to the sergeant: “I thought
so! He belongs to the Park—been missing,
since four o’clock this afternoon. Get a cab
and take him back.”
The cabman sat up straight. “Cab, sir!”
he whimpered. “My cab orter be outside,
sir. Give’s a job fer Gossake—ain’t done
nothin’ orl night since ’e run me inter this !”
Two constables assisted the Colonel to
his feet. _ He had done a gentle collapse at
the mention of “the Park,” and hung limply
between them, ready to be taken anywhere.
The sub-inspector nodded, and the ser-
geant led the way to the door, where- a flus-
tered young footman asked for the name.
The reviving cabman stuck out his chest
and grinned. “Kernerl Bernarna’s car-
nage !” he said.
There were a lot of official foreigners at
the function, and most of them wore
strange-sounding names. The footman
jumped and bawled, “Col-nel Ber-narner’s
carr-iage!”
Far down the drive someone roared,
“Col-onel Ber-narner’s kerrige !”
Still further awav in the darkness a third
voice roared faintly, “Col-onel Ber-narner’s
kerridge!”
The sad little lunatic sagged between his
policemen. The ancient cab horse in the
shadows flippantly whisked his ragged tail.
KODAK.
“The Vulnerable Coast.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We are all intimately associated with defence.
Even the Federal capital is not free from the same
consideration, for one of the soundest arguments that
can be used in favor of its speedy completion is that
it is advisable that the headquarters of the defence
forces should be well-removed from the vulnerable
coast.— Leader in the S. M. Herald.
In the pleasant summer weather, when
we’re bathing, all together,
In the crystalline and amethystine sea —
Girls and boys in scanty raiment, sun-tanned,
innocent and clamant —
When, in short, the blessed city’s on the
spree;
It is then we feel embarrassed as we think
of people harassed
Up the country, where the paddocks slowly
roast,
And the dust goes up in hazes where the
jumbuck dreams he grazes,
And the landscape looks remarkably like
toast —
Toast!
Along the coast
There’s a wet nor’-easter blowing
And a spring-tide sweetly flowing
Oh, things make a pleasant showing
On the Coast —
What the Herald calls “the vulnerable
Coast!”
In that weird and thirsty terra, which the
papers call Canberra;
Where the records go to show it rarely rains;
They have mapped out miles of country with
official effront’ry
And covered all the plan with blobs and
stains.
And they’ve also put a tent up, and a hun-
dred men they’ve sent up,
And they’ve dammed a dried-up river with
some stones,
And they’ve hired a farm as College, to im-
part a special knowledge
Of the arts of raising Cain and raising
loans —
Loans!
The Nation groans;
See! the mercury has mounted
Till its footsteps can’t be counted —
Till the legions can’t be reckoned
Of the Loans —
What the papers call “most necessary
loans.”
From the blythe and wetsome Ocean we
behold with mild emotion
How the tame official wriggles in the dust—
How he sweats and tans and withers, and
occasionally blithers
Of the hardships he enduresTj-because he
must.
And we read it in the Herald —which de-
clares we are imperilled
If the gusty, dusty Township isn’t built—
That the great and burning question of the
day is the congestion
In the Cify of the ’Arbor and the Silt —
Silt!
The milk is spilt;
All the crying will not risrht it —
All our finance will not fivht it—
Every day and every night it
Proves our guilt—
What statistics show most clearly is our
guilt!
So a sense of irritation burns the conscience
of the Nation
At the folly and the ignorance of those
Who are sworn to govern truly, but who
seem to rate unduly
All the silly things onr papers may propose!
Such, for instance, is the measure outlined
now, to “ease the pressure,”
In the Herald —You can hear its “leader”
boast!
The headquarters of onr Forces. —never mind
the men and horses —
Should he shifted from the vulnerable coast'
Coast!
Remove the host
Of the men who do the thinking
To the place where blokes are sinking
In the dust, fe.r stuff for drinking—
Where the ghost
Of a river does a perish at its post!
The thermometers are rising in a manner
most surprising—
But the water and the cash are sinking fast;
And the Boom in which men trusted will be
very shortly busted.
For the seasons and the market do not last.
But the good old horse Congestion (by The
Landlord out of Christian)
Runs steadily in front from year to year,
So, although we feel embarrassed for the
Outback folk so harassed.
Noo Sowth will meet the Unseen with a
Beer —
Beer!
Ah, never sneer!
Where the jumbuck dreams he grazes
On the mirage Jim-Jam daisies,
The tame, dry official praises
Yellow Beer—■
And if “Headquarters” they are shifted
up to where the dust is drifted
(As the Herald, quite uplifted, would
imply),
There’ll at least be Beer—almost like
the stuff that’s brewed upon the
Coast —
The invulnerable Coast that’s never dry.

CONCERNING A COMMON COMPLAINT.
Of all common ailments perhaps Constipation is the one most fruitful of
ill-health and a potent cause of disease in.a variety of forms. Too fre-
quently neglected (especially by women) it may result in grave conse-
quences, and all who suffer from it in any degree should set about
establishing a permanent cure without delay. Failure of the bowels to
act properly results in poisonous accumulations, impure blood, sluggish
liver, and 1 great number of disorders such as headaches, nervous debility,
anaemia, loss of energy, and even diseases of a chronic and dangerous
nature. If you are troubled with this really serious complaint do not
regard it as a light matter, and remember that the cure may be surely
and speedily effected by means of
