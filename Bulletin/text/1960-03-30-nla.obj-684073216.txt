CAPE YORK
The attraction of Coasts of Cape
York, by Coralie and Leslie Rees
(Angus and Robertson), is that it is
the far north, from Cooktown round
the top to the Aurukue Mission and on
to Normanton, as it is today: .what you
could see for yourself if you made the
trip—and were prepared to cope with
the rough seas and unreliable boats,
the tiny aeroplanes flying at tree-top
level along the uninhabited coasts, the
camping-out, the snakes, crocodiles,
leeches, mosquitoes and all the other
major and minor discomforts which
these cheerful and industrious travellers
encountered.
Thus if the tin-scratchers outside
Cooktown are very much as lon Idriess
observed them forty years ago, they
are none-the-less today’s tin-scratchers
—what is left of them—and Cooktown,
with the surprising murals which an
artist named Garnett Agnew painted
around the bar, “with a movement
close to that of Phil May or Will
Dyson,” is the Cooktown into which
the Reeses flew yesterday; or at any
rate not longer ago than it takes to get
a book written and printed. And Cook-
town has some peculiar sights for the
tourist and the reader:—
Meanwhile Vera suggested we
might see Black Mountain, a few
miles out, a fabulous height of dark,
soil-less, granite boulders, so loosely
piled one on another, with gaping
holes between, that climbers would
not dare to scramble over them even
to investigate the smoke that was
said to drift out of the mountain’s
bowels, having drifted into the said
bowels from bushfires on the wind-
ward side, This was strange enough,
but just as weird, judging by Vera’s
quick-edged description, was the
deafening roar of countless frogs
that sometimes floated up through
the granite caverns, or the cannon-
like blasts that accompanied the
violent cracking of the granite masses
after expansion and contraction in
the tropic sun.
Of course, in a book of this kind it
is not possible—or even desirable—
completely to dispense with historical
information; and it was not to be
expected that the travellers would
stop-off at Thursday Island without
recounting some of its lurid past,
including the mystery of Yankee Ned
Mosby’s missing pickle-bottle of pearls;
but it is more to the point that they
describe the system of co-operative
pearling by which the natives make
their living today; and still more to
the point that they see with their own
eyes the master-pearler’s car which has
a pearlshell number-plate,
But Thursday Island, being the out-
post for trade and administration in
the north, is only the beginning of the
journey, and the real fascination of
the book is when, travelling now by
boat, the authors get further and
further north where few travellers go
and a handful of missionaries (for
whom the Reeses have nothing but
praise) are practically the only inhabi-
tants.
At Bamaga. in the settlement under
the supervision of the Queensland
Department of Native Affairs, they see
a native girl driving a tractor; at Badu
in Torres Strait they meet the enthusi-
astic “quiz-kids’- taught by P. R. Frith;
on Mabuiag Leslie Rees goes sight-
seeing through the kunai-grass, collect-
ing green ants and orchids. Near
Hospital Point, battling against the
swift current, they have die interesting
experience of sailing backwards (to-
wards the rocks); and when, after the
flight by the DC-3 from Horn Island
along the beaches “like an unbroken
cream - yellow road, immaculate,
untrod, running mile after mile," on a
trip which has become too strenuous
for Mrs. Rees to continue, the plane
touches-down at the Presbyterian mis-
sion at Weipa, it is just about the end
of the world ... At least from here
on to Aurukun and Normanton trans-
port was very hard to come-by. There
was an Auster which went once a week
to Aurukun for meat, but it might or
might not have room for Leslie Rees;
and if it didn’t, “as for the next strip
of west coast, well, you walked or swam
if you had a mind to. Along those
hundreds of miles there were no more
than three or four settlements.”
This emptiness of the far north
troubles Leslie Rees, of course, as it
troubles ail Australians who think
about it. and for that reason he is
extremely interested in (and interesting
on) the immense bauxite deposits at
Weipa—“enough to last the whole
world for 400 years on present con-
sumption of aluminium.” Vast plans
for developing these are already in
operation; and it seems they may bring
a town of 5000 inhabitants for a start,
afterwards 15,000.
In the meantime there is the Auster.
It has room for Leslie Rees; and,
skimming so low along the coast that
they can see a 16ft. crocodile
“apparently buried deeply in ten or
more feet of water near the beach,” so
to Aurukun, where the girls go naked
to the waist and where, the mission
school being on holidays. Leslie Rees
goes camping, fishing and pig-hunting
with a very happy crowd of native
boys. We say farewell to him, as all
the best travel-talks put it, slowly
sinking in a small boat about sixteen
miles north of the Edward River with
the Bishop of Carpentaria.
The book, like so much of the water
the Reeses sailed-on. is a bit bumpy
in style, moving uncertainly between
the colloquial and the literary, and it
would read more smoothly if their
travels had had one single, clear objec-
tive, whether it was. to" be a study of
the missions, a study of the new mining
ventures, or simply a record of adven-
ture. But it is a very pleasant book
for all that; enterprising, humane and
full of topical Australian interest.
MOTH
The great moth winged with many eyes
frets from his breast its silver dust.
Caught in the net my lamp has cast
he beats and circles till he dies.
His life was set on some true path
until his kind inhabited night
betrayed him to a craze of light—
light meaningless and cold like death —
or so I said, who watched him parch
against his sterile radiant heaven :
a love unjoined, a gift ungiven,
strange failure in the eternal search.
And then turned back my pen to prayer
that might be language for a moth :
“O overcome me, Power and Truth ;
transmute my ignorance, burn it bare,
so that against your flame, not l,
but all that is not You, may die.”

Literary Awards
The 1959 Miles Franklin Award of
£5OO for the best Australian novel of
the year has been awarded to Vance
Palmer’s The Big Fellow. The judges
were Beatrice Davis. Dr. Colin
Roderick. lan Mudie, G. Williams and
G. D. Richardson of the Mitchell
Library.
A report from the Permanent
Trustee Co, of N. S. Wales says that
one of the judges preferred Lyndon
Rose’s Country of the Dead and that
“"two other novels discussed” were
Sammy Anderson. Commercial Travel-
ler, by H. D. Williamson, and Andrea
Caslin, by Leonard Mann.
Among the 18 novels submitted for
the award —it was. in retrospect, a sur-
prisingly good year for Australian
novels—-Red Page reviewers would also
have given very serious consideration
to Anne von Bertouch’s February
Dark, Gerard Hamilton’s Summer
Glare, Donald Stuart's Yandv and
David Forrest’s The Last Blue Sea.

DEFENCE AND ITS CRITICS
'T'HAT we have so little public opinion
A in favor of efficient defence is very
largely a result of the atmosphere
created round it by the Australian
Labor Party.
The Labor party, before World
War I was the party for defence. It
was all for compulsory military ser-
vice. It set its seal on the system. But
during that war it fell into the hands
of the rebellious Irish, and it has never
readjusted itself to reality or responsi-
bility.
This has been partly because it
learned how profitable in votes a
resistant attitude to military training
could be; how many women were
naturally ready to yield to the tempta-
tion to save their husbands and sons
and sweethearts from risking their
lives and livings in defence of the coun-
try, and how many shirker votes there
were.
In the Second World War the leaders
of the present Labor Federal caucus
played a sorry part. Mr. Ward was
in the van of anti-conscription (which,
in practical terms, meant anti-
recruiting), set afoot, as soon as war
was declared, by the group of Com-
munist union-secretaries who then
controlled the key industrial unions,
and the N.S.W. A.L.P. State Branch.
He opposed sending the A.I.F.
abroad and the militia to New Guinea.
He has in “Hansard,” to his discredit,
statements like the following, spread
oyer a number of years, thus showing
his consistency of viewpoint:—
I say frankly that no matter what the
nation may be with which Australia
comes into conflict, I shall not support
the project but will advise the un-
employed not to participate as they have
nothing to gain by doing so (“Hansard,”
October 26, 1932).
Panic-stricken, the Commonwealth
Government, along with the Imperial
Government, is spending an enormous
amount of money on what it claims to
be defence provisions. ... I should not
be prepared to take up arms against
the workers of any country whether they
be German or any other nationality.
(November 5, 1936).
As for Mr. Calwell, he was one of
those who killed Mr. Curtin’s resolu-
tion to send the militia to any part of
the South-west Pacific to stem the
Japanese advance which was pressing
towards our coasts.
Let the volunteers do it! Let the
hard-pressed British and American
conscripts do it!
Labor critics in the past few years
have preached continued distrust of
Japan, but they have also preached
that the Defence Forces were top-
heavy with brass-hats, that much of
the money devoted to “so-called
defence” should be used for housing.
They have ridiculed and obstructed
the National Defence scheme, have
done all they could to make it fail,
and, since the robustness of the Citizen
Military Forces depended on its inflow
from the National Defence camps, they
have done untold injury to the volun-
teer and citizen forces in general, and
are largely to blame for the fact that
it is impossible to continue to maintain
even a modified universal training
system, the breaking-up of which they
now deplore.
TT is certainly sad to see the glorious
roll of the Australian battalion his-
tory closed. But unfortunately the
primary objective of the existence of
military forces is not glory but the
protection Of the country against
enemies.
Every new military invention must
also bring drastic changes in tactics,
training and manpower needs and in
the shape and application and logistics
of formations and units.
The/changes now taking place have
not come too soon. They are largely
dictated by the elimination of distance
through fast aircraft and faster
missiles and radar.
They belong to an age in which the
hitting-power of a small unit with the
right weapon can do more damage in
ten minutes than a couple, of army
corps could have achieved in 1940 in
ten weeks; the age in which a single
submarine of the new United States
George Washington giant class could
stand 1000 miles off Sydney and wreck
the centre of the city with a single shot
of Polaris missile, or a single British
Vulcan bomber wreak even more
damage with one bomb.
The new age demands primarily a
mobile force for co-operation with
allies: one that can be moved with
great speed, taking its lethal equip-
ment with it. Our limitations of
resources give us little choice but to
make the compass of our effort small,
if it is to be at a maximum of
efficiency.
Behind our mobile, hard-hitting
group it is necessary to keep up a
force of some sort on which highly,
trained officers who will be necessary
in modern war can exercise them,
selves. Also, special officer-training
units—these are university regiments.
Under all the circumstances—it is
well to stress these last words—the
new scheme is the best that can be
achieved. That does not mean that
the ideal has been reached.
That would involve the training of
every man in the Commonwealth for
conventional, old-type defence and
every woman for civil defence in case
of attack.
If even a tenth part of this ideal
were embodied in a Commonwealth
plan it would be defeated by the vote-
buying tactics of the Calwell-Ward
opportunist vote-catchers, who seem to
be not averse to riding to power on
the fears of women and the selfishness
of backsliders, and through the sabotage
of security by Communist union-
leaders.
It is a pity, because it is as true of
modern wars as of ancient ones that
the army with the last reserves wins, a
lesson which was driven home forcibly
in Korea.
At the same time the problem of
modern defence divides itself into three
parts —to keep a fence round Australia
sufficiently far from it to prevent, if
possible, massive attack by enemy
forces, and this is something that can
only be achieved by integration with
the forces of more powerful allies; to
keep Australia thus safe as a base for
the production of military resources; to
be able to defend Australia on its rim
and on its own soil, if it is attacked
by an enemy who breaks through
outer defences bent on capturing those
resources intact rather than withering
them and the Australian population
with nuclear blasts.
AAR. CAL WELL and Mr. Ward, if
1 A they are capable of thinking in
terms of Australia’s current welfare and
not in terms of women’s votes and
appeals to the shirkers and the Red
providers of party finance, might care-
fully examine the real problems of
defence and offer an alternative to the
Government’s scheme in detail.
It is to be hoped that, if they take
this advice, it will be more practical
than that of their leader in 1938, who
proposed to destroy our enemies, come
what may, with a couple of squadrons
of two-seater aircraft; or than that of
the Curtin - Calwell - Ward Cabinet
which, when Japan attacked in 1941,
proposed seriously to the British and
Americans that Honshu and its great
cities should be blasted out of existence
by a force of a couple of aircraft-
carriers and some destroyers controlled
by themselves and sent without battle-
ship cover—a force capable of operat-
ing only halfway to its target from
Australian ports.




PLAIN ENGLISH
On the Black Ant-heap
The heat aroused in Australia and else-
where by the incidents in South Africa,
in which the police fired on a crowd of
angry natives who were resentful of
having to carry identity-cards, is natural.
And the death-roll of over 70 is
horrifying.
But there is little thought given to the
white side of the question. If the South
African Government’s view is extreme,
so is that of the other side. It is, in
fact, a case of two extremes meeting
each other head-on. And, as usual, mis-
chievous propaganda has become an
ingredient of the world-commentary.
The Cape Dutch, who dominate the
thinking of the Union, are a race hard-
ened by experience and conditioned by
fear. By their very historical beginnings
they are an aloof people. They have
fought the wilderness and they have
fought the British ; they have also had
to fight the African native in their time,
and have found him tough.
They have been at the Cape for 308
years since Jan van Riebeck took his
three small ships into Table Bay and
disposed of the claims of the few Hotten-
tots who were there by treaty and war.
They had moved inland by 1679. Their
blood and mode of living was changed
by the arrival of Huguenot infusions after
the Edict of Nantes had been revoked,
and at the beginning of the eighteenth
century the age of the trek-boer had
come in and the first germs of the policy
of penetration northward were working.
The “treks” began to move in earnest
late in the eighteenth century, and with
them came the continual war with
natives and the establishment of the
commando as a necessary part of the
social organisation for defence, first
against the few Hottentots, who scarcely
resisted the white encroachment, then
with the vanguards of the black north,
the Xosa Bantus in 1778, when war took
the border to the Great Fish River.
It was part of history that defence
against Xosa raiders was local, and
organised without much help from the
Government, so that war with the native
and fear of the native became part of
the normal domestic set-up of the Boer
farmer, a habit which caused great
trouble when the British took-over and
were accused of stirring-up Hottentots
and slaves against their Afrikander
masters. It was native questions that
brought rebellion within a few years.
And it is the native question that has
plagued the whole area ever since, each
expansion northward, whether by Boer
trek or British mining enterprise, adding
flame to the fire. The Communist
agitator and the native careerist in the
last few years have flourished in the
bitter atmosphere, in which the native
question can be played with such
destructive disadvantage to the West.
The South African Dutch white, with
his dour political and religious outlook, has
become, in the flood of half-caste and
black-native invasion of the south, like
a man who has been tied-down on an
ant-heap of black ants, with no hope of
escape and is blindly using every means
to shake them off.
The Afrikander attitude seems to be
one of desperation, though the British
section which is not so long rooted in
the soil has other views.
South African prosperity cannot sur-
vive without the goldmines of the Rand ;
and the goldmines, with their deep reefs
and low yields, cannot hope to survive
without cheap African labor. The black
cannot be given the franchise or allowec
equality without taking-over everything
the white has built into a land which
was miserable desert with a few yellow
or wandering black tribes when he came.
It is a most difficult and unhappy
situation, but it has not been improved
by the tragic shooting.
A Bad Loser
[From Canberra]
Eddie Ward’s latest move to force Sena-
tors and members to live in the electorate
or, in the case of Senators, the State which
they represent, is doomed to failure, as
was his attempt a fortnight ago to raise
the sectarian issue.
When caucus meets this morning new
Labor-leader Arthur Calwell will prob-
ably move that Ward’s notice of motion
on the issue is out of order.
While this will avoid any recrimina-
tions at caucus, it will not overcome the
fact that Ward is deliberately engaging
in a sniping campaign following his
defeat for the deputy-leadership.
While he employs such tactics the party
will still bear the taint of a disunited
rabble, quarrelling incessantly within
itself.
And, while that lasts, Labor has no
hope of reaching the Treasury benches.
Many members of the party are putting
Ward’s campaign down to the fact that
he is a bad loser. Former staunch
Ward-ites now say that, having been
defeated for the deputy-leadership, Ward
should accept the party’s decision grace-
fully and turn his efforts to assisting the
new leadership-team in its task of organis-
ing the party into a tight-knit fighting-
unit for the next elections.
Ward’s move to enforce members and
Senators to live in the area in which they
serve is aimed almost solely at Senate
Leader Nick McKenna, whom Ward
blames mainly for his defeat in the party
ballot.
McKenna, who is a member of the
Labor Senate team for Tasmania, lives
in Sydney mainly, as he has done for
many years past. In that time Ward
bas never once raised the- issue, but now
is trying to embarrass McKenna.
Another Labor politician who lives
outside his electorate is Joe Clark, mem-
ber for Darling, which takes in the
far west of N.S.W. virtually from
Queensland to the Victorian border. He
lives in Sydney, but by constant visits to
the major centres of his electorate he
seems to represent his electors well
enough.
Hopes for Summit
One of the great problems in securing
tranquillity in Europe over the past cen-
tury has been to establish accord between
France and Germany. Until recently,
there has been little chance of succeed-
ing. But, thanks to Dr. Adenauer and
successive French Governments (includ-
ing the de Gaulle regime), hope has lately
been high.
The new Germany as represented by
the Federal Government has been reluct-
ant to arm. It has fallen over
backwards in joining with France in
commercial blocs and arrangements. Its
relationships with France and the United
Kingdom have become orderly* The only
hostility which has radiated from Bonn
has been towards Russia with its oppres-
sion of East Germany, its attempts to
absorb Berlin, its constant moves to
disrupt and destroy the Federal German
Government and suck Western Germany
inside the Communist zone.
It now is clear that the main objec-
tive of Khrushchev in visiting France is
to disturb the relations between France
and Germany.
Visits like his are generally kept free
of discussions publicly of international
politics, but from the time he landed
on French soil he has consistently
preached distrust of Germany, and has
tried to arouse the belief that the Ger-
mans are engaged in a swashbuckling
preparation to attack France once more.
He is certainly not behaving like an
apostle of peace, and his behavior is in
strong contrast to his supposed purposes
when agreeing to the Summit Conference.
The Russians’ atomic-ban proposals at
Geneva would certainly stop all missile
tests in the United States, British Com-
monwealth, France and elsewhere, while
leaving Russia, if the facts are correctly
known, completely in the ascendant in
atomic weaponry and H-bomb stocks,
with the rest of the world unable to make
any progress towards equality.
Also, they would leave China entirely
free to operate, and, of course, Russia
to operate in China if that country con-
curred.
In plain fact, no agreement with Russia
is worth anything without complete safe-
guards.
The Inland
The plan of a group of graziers and
others whose centre of operations is the
capital of the Back o’ Beyond—Bourke
—to develop the inland is a refreshing
development.
There is no doubt but that the country
beyond the Dividing Range, particularly
in the north, has been going backwards
compared with the general advance of the
areas adjacent to the eastern coast and
the big cities.
The cost of materials and labor, the
high freights, the absence of educational
facilities, the lack of good roads and
other factors have all put a brake on


growth of population and intensification
of settlement.
In Queensland the Lands Department
has done a lot to encourage investment
in improvements of pastoral holdings
under lease from the Crown, but not
always with the desired effect.
Many a station which was renowned in
the old days and carried huge quantities
of stock with little improvement has
now been cut-up into improved blocks
for small settlers and is weighed down
with the imposts of several station
homes, more intensive fencing and
various other multiplications of equip-
ment inevitable when one property is
divided into several.
Often the number of stock carried
after the increased capital - investment
is less than in the older and more
careless days. Many a western town
has gone rapidly down the scale
and ceased to be a district capital of
importance to surrounding settlers as the
aeroplane and the motor-car and truck
have led to their being bypassed.
The mineral districts of the north-
west have, of course, progressed. But
otherwise it might be said that the sand
is moving eastward from the Territory,
and the country of the areas more subject
to drought have gradually deteriorated
through overstocking.
The far west of N.S.W. carries fewer
stock than before Federation.
The Central Western division of
Queensland has, on an area of 71,000
square - miles, embracing some of the
finest inland pastoral areas in the Com-
monwealth, less than one head of popu-
lation to three square-miles. The total
of round about 23,000 has actually de-
clined since 1933, The same is true of
the Far Western division of the State,
where about 5500 people live on an area
of 109,000 square-miles—an area larger
than Victoria by a quarter.
The populations of all pastoral north-
western districts in the State have shown
declines in population in the past 27
years, with the one exception of the
mining areas round Cloncurry, which
include Mount Isa and Mary Kathleen.
The scheme which is being put forward
by the pastoral group envisages an ex-
penditure of perhaps £2OO million to
clear watercourses and distribute water-
supply for the development of inland
areas, holding some of the rainfall which
now flows to the coast to turn inland.
It envisages also a great transcontinental
highway connecting the south-eastern
capitals and ports and the country right
through to Wyndham.
Old-timers with a knowledge of the
country and how much of it responds
to feeding-off are naturally sceptical
about whether such a vast outlay, which
after all is only half the cost of the
Snowy Mountains Scheme, will pay. But
it is worth a thorough examination.
Permanent rivers are the essence of
development, and there are many water-
courses that now have the name of
rivers and which for a few months in
the year are turbulent rivers, and which
might be controlled and made to hold
water for long periods.
Myer's and Rivals
Arnot Tolley, chairman of Myer’s,
explained at a press interview the very
interesting set-up of Chadstone Shopping
Centre, which is now about half-
completed on a 30-acre site.
Chadstone is a good-class suburb in
south-eastern Melbourne. It is a new
but hardly an outer suburb, and perhaps
should be classed as an in-and-outer
suburb.
The capital-investment will be £6-million,
not by Myer’s directly but by Chad-
stone Shopping Centre Pty., Ltd., a sub-
sidiary of Myer Emporium, Ltd., and the
proprietary will lease premises to Myer’s,
G. J. Coles, Buckley and Nunn, Foy and
Gibson, Rockman’s, Patersons and
McEwan’s, and about 70 others.
Myer’s describe the other lessees as
friendly business rivals, so it may be
accepted that David Jones’ will not be
present, in the sterner business outlook
which would debar Myer’s from any
similar scheme sponsored in Sydney.
Myer’s have so far been elbowed out
of the Sydney market, in the same
manner that Rupert Henderson has kept
the Sydney newspaper ring for himself
and Sir Frank Packer, despite the willing-
ness of Sir John Williams, of the Mel-
bourne “Herald,” to box-on.
Myer’s invitation to its Melbourne
rivals to take them on at Chadstone is
sound. Experience has shown there is
little patronage for markets where there
is no competition. It is not merely
another supermarket. A supermarket
will be just one of the tenants. The
venture is at least one of' the biggest
single retail-merchandising developments
undertaken in Australia.
Some months ago Myer’s were reported
to be studying the lay-out of suburbs,
similar to those which Chadstone will
serve in Melbourne, in Sydney.
Taxes and Pensions
Three out of four people want the
means-test for pensions abolished, prefer-
ably quickly, according to the latest
Gallup Poll, confirming the hardening
of public opinion in Australia against
the means-test ever since the war.
The latest poll shows that within 18
months a rise of from 66 per cent, to
77 per cent, in favor of abolishing the
means-test, with 49 per cent, in favor
of abolition now, 28 per cent, favoring
a gradual abolition, 17 per cent, in favor
of retaining it, and six per cent,
undecided.
The Melbourne headquarters of the
poll assures The Bulletin that it was a
most satisfactory poll, and there is no
reason to question its accuracy.
The party voters polled almost the
same figures, with the Liberals 79 per
cent, and Laborites 76 per cent, in favor
of abolition. Liberals were 47 per cent,
for its immediate ending, Labor 53 per
cent.
The question was phrased very much
the same on both occasions, and the
poll ranged over the twenties to the
sixties in age.
In its newspaper report, the poll gave
as the commonest reasons proffered for
abolishing the test that all now contri-
bute by taxes and that people who save
now are penalised. The chief of these
is the first—the gradual awakening to
the enormous revenues of the Federal
Government.
When the polls were first taken, a
substantial portion of the population
simply did not understand excise, hidden
taxes and duties as taxes, but they have
become more conscious of them now.
Direct taxation impinges on their aware-
ness with its deeper bites as the basic-
wage rises, and margins for skill, increase.
Another Referendum
The usual scuttling for cover by the poli-
tical parties followed the publication in
Victoria of Judge Fraser’s long-awaited
report on his overseas tour with the
inevitable recommendation for extended
hotel trading-hours, as well as the licens-
ing of taverns in big buildings such as
offices, apparently on the lines of what
is a common feature, of English life, and
a better deal for restaurants.
Stoneham, the Labor leader, read the
newspaper summaries and found them
very interesting. Sir Herbert Hyland was
even more profound, on behalf of the
Country party. He invited the Cabinet
to make-up its mind as to what it would
do about the report, and the Country
party would then make-up its mind. The
Premier performed a forward and back-
ward scuttle. On the hours question he
retreated, but on the tavern and
restaurant recommendations, which are
hardly controversial, he indicated
acceptance.
In contrast with this jiggery-pokery by
the political parties, advertising their
readiness to lose a great social reform
for the chance of scoring at one
or two of the others’ expense, many
representative Victorian citizens made
known their views, and, aside from those
of the notable narks, they were
unanimously in favor of longer hours.
This focuses attention again on the
desirability of the case for extended
hours being handled by a citizens’ com-
mittee, and not by the liquor interests ;
hotelkeepers are less disliked in Vic-
toria since they now are making less
money than the near-by milk-bar, but
breweries are unpopular, even with the
publicans.
It may be justly claimed that the State
Cabinet should adopt Judge Fraser’s
recommendations since he was sent
abroad, because of his experience and
intelligence and forthright honesty, to
make them ; but there is some excuse for
Bolte’s refusal to adopt them without
another referendum. His Government
did give the electors the opportunity to
end the six-o’clock swill in Victoria at
the 1956 referendum. It is now time for
another, with the liquor interests piped
down.

“Wynbal”: Mention of the W.A.A.F
reunion in Melbourne (B. 9/3/’6O) took
me back to the day in 1944 when
provosts tooth-combed the N.Q. troope
on which Rusty happened to be travel
ling without a leave-pass. A few jumps
ahead of the Jacks, he crashed the com-
partment occupied by a bevy o:
W.A.A.F.s and blurted out his plight. The
comeliest of the lasses clamped
W.A.A.F. jacket over Rusty’s head anc
enjoined her mates to do some hasty
undressing. When Rusty saw daylight
again he found a W.A.A.F. blouse, skirt
and droopy hat on the seat beside him
When he had donned the disguise the lass,
in discreet deshabille, half-opened the
door to the clamoring provosts, inquired
trenchantly if they thought the W.A.A.F.
reserved compartment was. a wheeled
bagnio, invited them to look around with-
out perving, and then banged the sliding
door almost before the sergeant had time
to withdraw his nose. Then, with equal
forcefulness, she emptied Rusty out, after
giving him two minutes to shed his
feminine trappings. Next morning at
Townsville Rusty fronted the lass to ex-
press his thanks. She looked at him as
though she didn’t know him from Adam.

they’ve opened a new restaurant which,

a choice of 80 hot and cold dishes, among

Patrons pay one guinea, and are then
permitted to eat “as much as they can.”
The joint is called “The Guinea and the
Piggy,” which rather smacks of giving

it “The Guinea and the Guts.” But

sovereigns in any quantity (B. 9/3/’6O)
was in 1930, when the private banks had
to hand-over their holdings to the Com-

bank in a large N. S. Wales country
town at the time, and we had about 6000
sovereigns. Head-office said the coins
were to be bagged, boxed, securely
bound with steel tape, plastered 1 with
the bank’s seal and a police escort
obtained to take them to the railway-
station. Thds protected, and with a
clerk as additional escort (plus a couple
of revolvers) we set-off by *cab for the
station. There the box was handed-over
to the stationmaster. Later in the day
I met the Sydney-bound train and filled-
in the time walking up and down the
platform. And, sure enough, there was the
box of sovereigns sitting with milk-cans
and sundry other goods at the far end
of the platform.

I slept in an attic room, and there in the

I thought they catered for suicides ; on
further investigation found the other end
attached to a canvas bosun’s chair, to be
used as a fire-escape. Large hallways and
reception-rooms—near the coat-pegs was


a two-tiered contraption of wood ; later
I saw it festooned with black top-hats on
the top shelf, and with widows’ bbnnets,
complete with veils on the lower. Appar-
ently they belonged to a crowd of
mourners having a wake inside. By the
number of champagne-glasses which
came out they were giving the corpse a
nice old nudge into eternity—and next
morning the übiquitous champagne-glass
was doing duty as a holder for a wide
tea-strainer at breakfast!

“R.T.0.”: When the packing-cases

of about ss. was made to see the machine
unpacked and put together. That would
be some time in November, 1909. Flights
were advertised to take place at Victoria
Park racecourse. I went to one. After
some preliminary manoeuvres in which
it never left the ground the plane swung
"This is Saturday! Cant you go to golf or something ?”
over towards the centre of the racecourse,
where it got on to some broken ground
and suddenly stopped. A crowd of fans
rushed over and found that the tail and
propeller were damaged. That was the

DRESSING-DOWN TECHNIQUE
“The modern girl who is jilted doesn’t waste
her time in self-pity but quickly goes back into
circulation. That this healthy outlook owes
no little to the sensible clothes she wears
may not be at once apparent, but it is definitely
so.” — Woman’s magazine.
In that slow-paced, far-off Edwardian
day,
When gal was jilted
To bleak dejection she became a prey
And slowly wilted.
She'd chuck a sugardoodle (swoon),
Be lachrymose from morn till noon.
Her path to misery was strewn
With phrases stilted
Beefed by Papa (whose peace was cleft,
For on his hands she might be left!).
Might not the ironclad stays that shored
Her up
Have strangled confidence restored ?
With whalebone diced along with sweep-
ing skirt
That stirred the dust up.
Today’s lass won't concede that she’s
been hurt
When there’s a bust-up.
“Shoot-through, you clot — l’ll keep the
ring !”
That’s how her parting-shot she’ll sling
Before at other bods she’ll fling
Herself ; not fussed-up
Is she by having had her love
Trodden-upon like cast-off glove.
No getting in the least deranged.
My, my!
How plighted-troth affairs have changed !
The skirt whose hem is up around the
knee
Is now a token
That modern damsels’ hearts can never
be
So easily broken
As in the days of one-lung car,
Of horse-drawn tram and gaslit bar,
When it was most irregular
For maid bespoken
To kick-back, being given the bird.
Now, not to kick seems quite absurd.
Why ? She feels free. Not one et

But skimpy step-ins, briefs and bra I

“Bo”: The shipboard villain in a

world-tripping in old-fashioned ships, and
whenever I got in a temper, expressing
my ungovernable anger by endeavoring
to hurl either trunk or suitcase out the
porthole, such were the narrow, rigid
apertures then that the receptacles invari-
ably bounced back and donged me on
the bean. How vastly different it is with
the modern ship, in which this ether-play
was obviously set. Since those old days
when I was sea-girt, marine architecture
has recognised the totally unsatisfactory
nature of the old porthole and, for the
benefit of intending murderers and
passengers who may wish to let off steam
by chucking their possessions into the
drink, has come up with a really first-

“Maitri”: A couple of years back a
well-gilded acquaintance bought himself
a block of land in an attractive Sydney
suburb and spared no expense to get
his dream-home built on it—the back

Menzies is taking Paul Hasluck abroad
with him when he sets out for the Com-

Affairs portfolio when he decides to
pass it on. They could be right. Before
Hasluck entered Parliament in 1949 he
was one of the rising stars of the Depart-
ment of External Affairs.
Meanwhile the P.M. said on TV on
Sunday night that for the present he
intended to retain the portfolio but
would delegate some of the authority to
a junior Minister. If he found this un-
workable he would pass the job “to
somebody else.”

■pLANS submitted by a firm of Danish
civil-engineers for pre-cast concrete-

differing slightly in routes, the tunnels
seem to be essentially the same as the
scheme put forward several times by
Sydney engineer D. R. Carter. The
Dapes have at least had their proposals
investigated. Carter’s have been lying on
shelves of the Local Government Depart-
ment for several years and, despite fre-
quent inquiries, he has never been able
to get a straightout answer. The esti-

Victorian Transport Minister Warner
last week made probably the best speech
of his career in defence of the Railways.
It was so sincere that even the off-duty
Parliamentary newspapermen remained
in the Legislative Council to listen. He
attacked politicians (particularly pres-
sure-groups) and Parliamentary demands
for uneconomic lines to be retained, for
uneconomic charges to be made (on
country freights), and for the running
of uneconomic services ; and he paid a
tribute to the conscientious railwayman,
agreed with his right to strike, but
pointed to the sad fact that strikes drove
away customers who never returned.
Warner’s speech was made on an
adjournment motion which once would
have been regarded as a motion of cen-

Government won because three Labor

3,660,000, bringing the total to
208,826,000 ; and of course the “average
•life-span” of Russians (including the
primitives of the Asian republics) is
“twice what it was before the Russian
revolution.” It is claimed to be 67 years,
“one of the best in the world.” The
expectation-of-life figure is subject to
deep suspicion. This especially because
of the Soviet Union’s huge loss of young
age-groups, male and female, during the
war.

“Judee”: They speak in millions at
the N.S.W. Forestry Commission, which
announces that in the winter and early
spring of last year million pine-trees
were planted in 5811 acres of State
forests. The bias these days is in favor
of Finns radiata, which yields the popu-
lar softwood known as Monterey pine.
Ninety-two per cent, of the new plant-
ings was of this variety. In its softwoods-
planting programme the commission aims
at the establishment of a minimum area
of 200,000 acres of plantations (73,000
acres at present). Each year almost 40
million super.-feet of logs are taken from
N.S.W. plantations—this could rise to
500 million a year in 50 years’ time, says
the commission.


After a stream of complaints had
poured into Sydney papers alleging
overcharges in telephone accounts a neat
piece of liaison-work between the
P.M.G.’s Department and the A.B.C.
brought a Telephones Branch technical
man on to Channel 2 to explain to
viewers, with the aid of a phone-meter,
just how the tally of a subscriber’s calls
was recorded. Asked what the chances
of a mistake were, he said mistakes were
most unlikely, but if one did occur it
would be more likely to favor the sub-
scriber than penalise him. Amplifying
this, he said the meter was more likely
to miss a cal! than to record one that
hadn’t been made.
The following day the Sydney “Herald”
published two letters giving instances
where a phone-account had been reduced
after protest and a refund made by the
department. In one case the first bill was
for £67, and was later reduced to £l7.
In the other the original account was for
£4l 4s. 2d., and the final bill 3s. lOd.

Treasurer Holt deplored the use by
Bury, M.H.R., of the word “phony” in
•reference to Post Office profits. He said
the word was a “rather unhappy” choice.
On the contrary, it seems a very happy
choice since almost all the profit was
made on phones.

Heffron is sure that the Opposition in
the Legislative Council cannot reject the
regulations increasing railway freights
with the help of the rebel Labor men,
because four of them have undertaken
not to vote against the Government.
However, he can’t be too cheerful. He
is now a hostage of this moneybag wing
of “Labor.” For the rest of its term the
existence of the Government depends on
placating its expelled rebels.

Another Iron Curtain diplomat seems
to have decided to flit the coop. First-
secretary of the Polish Embassy in
Djakarta, Ryszard Krolicki, has been
reported by his chief to have been missing

sought asylum at the U.S. Embassy in
Djakarta and has asked for permission to

'T'ed Bray, editor of the Brisbane
“Courier Mail,” one of the dele-
gates to the U.N. Press Institute
in Tokyo, attacked the busybodying
scheme of U.N. to define press
freedom and said accurately that
“any attempt to define freedom limits
that freedom.” He did not say what the
monopolistic swallowing of newspapers
does to freedom. In Brisbane it is
possible to read only one view over the
breakfast-table. And Brisbane’s only
afternoon paper is now in the same
stable.

High standards of safety have been
established in civil aviation in Australia
but recent developments, including the
use of civil jet-airliners flying at much
the same speeds and altitudes as military
aircraft, have caused the authorities some
concern, and common rules and air-
traffic and traffic-control procedures have
now been approved. These apply to
both civil and military aircraft, and will
be in force not only throughout Austra-
lia but, in co-operation with Indonesia,
Singapore, Fiji and New Zealand, on in-
ternational air routes to and from this
country.
There’s also been a revision of the
special air-space needed for all types of
flying-training for firing-ranges, and for
the positive separation of civil and
military aircraft on busy civil-air routes.

Ghana has ordered 3000 Australian-
made F.N. rifles, with ancillary equip-

tribute to the management and crafts-
men there.

~P ddie Ward had a field week at Can-
berra. Apart from demanding that
all Labor members be compelled to live
in their electorates, he tossed a panel of
war-ribbons across the table. It was
scarcely necessary for him to explain that
they were not his own, but those of a
“disillusioned war-veteran.” Ward seems
to have an affinity for disillusioned war-
veterans. The number that have besieged
him since the day in 1940 when he
recounted how he stood in the doorway
of the Hotel Australia and they besieged
him hollow-eyed with hunger, as he
watched the Sixth Division march past,
would fill a couple of Army Corps.

After herculean efforts the delegates
to the Disarmament Conference at
Geneva have once more arrived at agree-
ment on principles—The need for an
international-disarmament organisation ;
the need for staged control of disarma-
ment ; the need for agreement to be
world-wide and by treaty ; and the need
for international inspection of disarm-
ing measures. The only thing they haven’t
agreed to do is disarm.

E. J. Walsh, deputy-leader of the
Q.L.P., denied on TV that he had any
intention of trying to rejoin the A.L.P.
He said that in no circumstances would
he “dump” Vince Gair. Calwell had
earlier held-out an olive-branch to the
rank-and-file of the Q.L.P., at the same
time saying that there could be no ques-
tion of re-admitting Gair. But surely
Walsh wouldn't qualify as rank-and-file?

It has been suggested in the press that
some officers whom Army Minister
Cramer allegedly criticised at a
private meeting of the Government
parties may sue him for libel and that
party-meetings within the precincts of
the House are not privileged. It is time
the Government took steps to have
privilege of Parliament and its geo-
graphical limits defined. It is amazing
if a group of members can't meet with
Ministers and discuss public administra-
tion fearlessly without the' risk that a
leak will land them in the courts. And
it isn’t in accord with public policy,
either.

17'hrushchev has arrived in Paris look-
ing sick and sullen, and somewhat
drab amid the splendors with which the
French always deck their welcomes.
Paris can scarcely see him for guards
and relations. And the fact that the
French are feeding him foie de gras and
lobster will scarcely improve his form.
The French have cunning ways of deal-
ing with their enemies.

The Anzac Memorial which stood on
the bank of the Suez Canal until Nasser’s
mob wrecked it at the time of the Suez
affair has been landed at Albany (W.A.);
it will be repaired and re-erected at a
spot overlooking King George’s Sound.
This is a most appropriate decision. It
was there that the ships of the First
Contingent of the A.I.F. assembled in
1914. For many of the Diggers who died
on Gallipoli King George's Sound was
the last glimpse they had of their home-
land.

“Stromlo”: The P.M.G. reported a
record number of telephones and calls in
1958-59, and “new levels of business”
were reached on the postal side, with
almost 2000-million articles handled Yet
there was a decrease in the volume of
internal and external telegrams,
undoubtedly a reflection of the higher
charges imposed during the year
reviewed. The phone and mail figures
were before the latest imposts, and it
seems possible that next year both those
services will reflect public opinion of the
higher rates.

Japan has acquired a new party, with
53 members in the two houses of Par-
liament. A breakaway from the Socialist
party, which is predominantly Left wing,
it aims “at turning the whole population
into a single middle-class, against the
background of a heightened culture and
scientific progress.” This seems to be a
fair description of what is happening to
the rank-and-file of Australian Labor,
even though no organised party is work-
ing for it.

Fast on the heels of Judge Fraser’s
recommendation for extended
trading-hours for Victorian hotels comes
a three-man mission of New Zealand
M.P.s who have been appointed as a
select committee on licensing reform and
want to study the working of 10-o’clock
closing in N. S. Wales. Enzed pubs close
at 6 p.m.
Meanwhile, Bolte looks like leaving
the trading-hours section of the Fraser
report on the shelf until after next year's
general election. He may give earlier
attention to the recommendations for
liquor-only licences and restaurant-
licences.

Leslie Rees, in his literary capacity,
finds himself the father of twins this
month: a new travel-book, Coasts of
Cape York, and a new children’s-book,
Wy-lah the Cockatoo. His industry may
have been stimulated by the fact that one
of his children’s-books, Karrawingi the
Emu, was lately reprinted in the Soviet,
where it sold 115,000 copies . . . for which
the Russians, not having joined the inter-
national copyright agreement, do not

One of Australia’s oldest, the firm of
Dangar, Gedye and Malloch, was founded
in 1838 by Richard Dangar. The Malloch
connection originated in 1919, when
Robert Anthony Malloch joined the firm
as a partner. Malloch had started his
working-life at the age of 13 during the
1893 depression at a wage of 2s. 3d. a
week, and later had the good fortune
to join the staff of Bewick Moreing and
Co., mining engineers, and serve under
Herbert H. Hoover, later President of
the United States but then a partner
in the firm and its principal engineer.
Hoover’s methods impressed young
Malloch, and some of his advice was
never forgotten, such as: “If you delay
“D.G.M."
selling until you can’t see a profit for the
buyer, you’ve left it too late.”
After working three years in Mel-
bourne with the Zinc Corporation, Ltd.,
he moved to Western Australia and
joined his brother in the firm of Malloch
Brothers, indentors, especially of fencing-
wire and wire-netting. Robert, as
junior partner, set out on his journeys
to call on farmers and graziers mounted
on a pushbike.
Dangar, Gedye and Malloch have
now moved their premises from Malloch
House, near Sydney’s Circular Quay,
where they have been for 33 years, to
Rydalmere, where a new factory and
office-block have been constructed.
Present managing-director Robert Arnold
Malloch (sketched herewith), son of
Robert Anthony, was born in Sydney,
schooled at King’s and entered the
family-firm three years before its cen-
tenary. He’s been with it ever since,
except for the time he took off during
War II to serve in the Middle East
with the R.A.A.F. (he was shot-down,
severely wounded and “bagged” for
three years, until repatriated because
of his wounds). He became m.-d. in
1951, soon after his father’s death.
C. I. A. Beale, agricultural officer of
the Bank of N.S.W. and newly elected
president of the N.S.W. branch of the

Cambridge in 1950. A committeeman
of the institute for over two years and
branch vice-president last year, he has
had as his particular interest the exten-
sion sub-committee, which aims to
cover all aspects of extension-work and
services throughout the Commonwealth.

Passed-on, in England, at 85, Sir
Frank Fox, first editor of the “Fone
Hand,” was born in Adelaide and
educated at Christ’s College, Hobart.
When he was 18 the Australian Fabor
Party appointed him editor of the “Aus-
tralian Workman”; at 21 he took-on
the editorship of the “National Adver-
tiser.” Later he joined the editorial staff
of The Bulletin and for a time acted
as editor before Archibald put him in
charge of the “Lone Hand.” He went
to London in 1909, where he joined the
staff of the “Morning Post,” becoming
its war-correspondent in the Balkan War
and later with the Belgians in the first
stages of War I. In December, 1914, he
joined the Royal Field Artillery and was
twice wounded on the Somme, sub-
sequently serving at the War Office, end-
ing as major, with the 0.8. E. and the
Order of the Crown of Belgium. After
the war he returned to journalism and
continued his advocacy of the Imperial
cause. As its secretary, he organised the
Fellowship of the British Empire
Exhibition, and he also did much to
foster the British Empire Cancer Cam-
paign and the Empire Rheumatism
Council. He published several books,
mostly on Imperial themes, and was
knighted in 1926.

“Collins Street”: Barney Porter, one
of the best-known reporters in the land,
died in Melbourne last week, and,
although he had worked most recently
with the “Age,” its morning rival, the
“Sun,” gave a full column to his career,
not merely because he was a fine news-
paperman but also because of the courage
with which he had pursued a good spot
news-story. Barney Porter had worked
on almost every newspaper in Melbourne
and Sydney, an unconscionable number
closing under him.

Elected a life-member of the Western
Australian Farmers’ Union at this year’s
annual conference in Perth, Eric

the C.B.E. in recognition. A member of
the old Primary Producers’ Union back
in 1919, he subsequently joined the
Great Southern Woolgrowers’ Federa-
tion, served a term as president of the
Australian Wool and Meat Producers’
Federation, has been a member of the
Australian Wool Board (now the Aus-

“Kangi”: Memorial to the Maori
V.C., Ngarimu, is a scholarship-fund
designed to help promising Maori
students. Three new awards have been
announced. One winner has a good old
traditional Maori name Haupai Henare.
Another, Leanna Rose Walker, reflects
the growing European influence. The
other student reminds us that when Maori
and European influences combine we get
some unexpected results. Who but our
happy Maori people would ever think
of calling their new baby “Daddy”? But
here it is: Daddy Kingi Houkamau.

Darwin Safari, Ltd., is the brainchild
of Allan Stewart, the rugged individua-
list pictured herewith. He started the
enterprise a while ago —given a send-
off in B. 2/7/’58 —and called iin at The
Bulletin office when he was last in
Sydney to report progress. He’s doing
well with his camp at Nourlangie, 120
air-miles east of Darwin, and now pro-
poses to. make improvements there,
erect a motel in Darwin, and start a
cattle-breeding project.
The idea first came to him during
the last war, he says, when his C.-O.
in the Darwin Mobile Force used to send
men off with 100 rounds each on safari
in the Territory. Stewart says he never
lived- so well as in those days. So, when
he founded Darwin Safari, he took a
lease of 1200 square-miles around
Nourlangie, which lies on the South
Alligator River in Arnhem Land, enlisted
a staff of 20 and the services of 90
natives who live in a nearby aboriginal
reserve, and began to operate a fleet of
fast light aircraft between Darwin and
the all-weather airstrip at the camp.
Within the area he leases, he says, there
are about 80,000 buffaloes. These, with
crocodiles, wild pigs, kangaroos and
dingoes— to say nothing of the game-
birds —give ample scope for any would-
DARWIN SAFARI
be marksman (and, to ensure that the
rules of safety are kept, his own team
of skilled shikaris accompany each shoot-
ing-party). For those who prefer it,
there’s,fishing and water-skiing, and, for
the less bloodthirsty, photography.
Altogether, it looks as if he’s found
a sort of Shangri-la where city-slickers
can relax far from the madding crowd.
Now he’s on his way to a lecture-tour
in the U.S.A., and later he’s going to
New Caledonia to see what he can do
about organising a similar project there.

“D.”: Bill (E. W.) Tipping, the Mel-
bourne columnist, was in a boat owned by
an advertising-agency man that got into
difficulties off Sorrento, near the
treacherous Rip, but was rescued by a
launch. It was a large launch with many
aboard, but one fellow, obviously the
seaman, was doing most of the work.
Tipping had a few pounds in his pocket,
and when they landed handed it unobtru-
sively to the hard worker. “Oh, no thank
you, Mr Tipping. I don’t need it,” he
said, and when he was out of earshot,
the ad.-man asked, “Didn’t you recognise
Chandler, the Minister for Agriculture?”
Tipping doesn’t reckon this was worth
a par.

The council of Melbourne’s Monash
University is not letting the building
grow-up without a staff. Another new
appointment, as Foundation Professor

Henderson Hunt, who at 39 is currently
senior lecturer in mechanical engineering
at Melbourne University, having come
there via Charterhouse School, Balliol
College, Oxford, and war service with

ABORIGINALITIES
TPhe battler built one small brick room—
obviously the future laundry—and
moved into it with his young wife. Then
began the slow, patient task of adding the
rest of the large cottage —much like
sewing a shirt onto a button. He was a
bricklayer—the quality of his work
proved that—and a New Australian;
probably German or Dutch, judging by
the name roughly painted on the fence
for the guidance of brickcarters. Week-
end after weekend he toiled at the job,
apparently using the bricks as he could
afford them. The normal practice of
building-in door- and window-frames was
apparently beyond his finances; he
simply left the openings in the walls. His
slow, solo progress went on for nearly
two years ; then came the day when the
walls were ready for the roof, and
carpenters came and put the roof-timbers
up. Next day a huge wreath of foliage
“Take a deep breath, madam."
hung from the ridging. Whether it was
a good-luck charm from his erstwhile
homeland or merely a bit of spontaneous,
triumphant exuberance on the part of the
battler or his charming blonde wife I
wouldn’t know ; but I trust it does bring
them good luck —they’ve earned it!

“Good Teacher”: The eight-year-old
son of the owner of a prize (N.Q.) sheep-
stud wrote in his essay on sheep: “Ewes
have lambs, but sometimes the bitches
leave them.” In correction teacher com-
mented: “Mix-up of animals —essay on
sheep, not dogs.” We all thought it
very tactful, as Sonny can’t be blamed
for the language he hears Dad use.
* * * *
“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Seems a far cry
from what went on not so long
back the Papuan - New Guinea
Department of Agriculture now con-
ducting tours by native farmers to other
" districts, to let them see how better
crop-production methods by more
advanced groups are paying-off in bigger
returns. One group recently went from
Bougainville to Wewak to study harvest-
ing, curing and marketing of peanuts.
A good time was had by all.
* * * *
“Wommadoo”: When a four-year-old
boy was lost in rugged mountain-country
near Guyra (N.S.W.) a month or so
ago more than 3000 people searched day
and night for four days before he was
found, mercifully little the worse. Both
a blacktracker and a dog were used, with
little success, but they were not called-in
till the search had been in progress for
some time, and no trail is easy to follow
when a few thousand people have been
romping all over it. Certainly it would
then be beyond the average N.S.W.
police-tracker, who is often clean, well-
dressed and a good type, but profes-
sionally miles behind his naked ancestors,
the finest trackers, stalkers and hunters
who ever lived. Can nothing be done
to preserve their unique skill? Or are
we still too immature to admit that a
“poor old boong” might teach us a trick
or two?
“Peanut”: Although there’s little
scope for competition on the job, there
is great rivalry in off-hours between
members of our town’s police-force and
the fire-brigade. A while back they staged
a race in the police-station yard between
a young constable and a brigade station-
officer. The station-officer had to walk
100yds. ; the constable to run the same
distance and drink a cup of water. No
rules about drinking the water ; he could
drink it before he ran, during the course
of the race or after he had run. He
chose to drink it before. At the startijig-
line the constable was very confident,
and the race was run —or walked.
Winner was the walker; the constable
was left at the barrier trying to drink a
cup of hot water.

“Breezer”: Tell “Snobby” (B.
9/3/’6O) that a challenge for a game of
bullring will be quickly accepted in the
local at Maude (N.S.W.), on the lower
reaches of the ’Bidgee. However, the
ring and hook there are not relics of
bullock-team and river-steamer days;
they were erected to while-away the
time during the ’56 flood. The locals
quickly became experts, the then Bung
setting the record (which still stands) at
44. A Murphy and a teetotaller, he
could lick most comers by swinging the
ring from alongside the hook and ring-
ing it on the way back—which doesn’t
look easy, and isn’t. The game still
holds its own with quoits and hookey,
but runs a poor third to duck-shooting
and fishing.

“En Passant”: Parts of Australia’s
coastal waters haven’t been surveyed
since windjammer captains of the R.N
charted them more than 100 years ago,
and only a percentage of them have been
surveyed by modern methods. The dan-
gerous waters off Queensland’s east coast
(the Inner Route to Torres Strait
excepted) have received scant attention
since surveys by Flinders (1802), Stokes
(1843-45) and Denham (1859). A large
slice of the Barrier Reef is dismissed as
“unexamined,” and its eastern edge has
never been satisfactorily delimited.
Before 1930, surveyors used hand-leads
to make soundings ; a grain of guesswork
went into calculations of distance ; and
old charts of northern waters are addi-
tionally suspect because of remarkable
reef-building work by coral-polyp.
The results are uncharted reefs which

occurred in 1890 when the Quetta struck
a rock in Adolphus Channel; most
recent notable casualty, U.S. merchant-
man Carondelet, fell victim in 1944 to a
shoal in Cumberland Channel. Both
channels are on the Inner Route to
Torres Strait. In 1946 the R.A.N. Survey
Service began a 25-year programme to
modernise all charts of Australian waters
—something the Japanese attended to
years before World War 11, especially in
northern waters and adjacent to channels
connecting inner Reef-waters with the
Coral Sea.

“Judee”: The N. S. Wales Rice
Marketing Board and its Federal counter-
part are doing a good job in promoting
the sale of rice with propaganda overseas
and at home, and more and more Aus-
tralian-grown rice is being exported as
one result. But as rice-eaters Australians
aren’t in the race. Our consumption of
4jrlb. a head is growing—in rice-pudding-
conscious Britain it is only 2^lb.-31b. —
but we are a long way behind Italy
(12.31 b.) and the Lebanon (701 b.).
Encouraged by Indonesian ways of cook-
ing rice- the Netherlands people have
raised their intake to 31b. The greatest
rice-eaters of all are the people of
Okinawa, south of Japan—they get
through 2001 b. a year each.

“Jaygee”: Seems that every year
Canadian apiarists destroy large amounts
of bee-brood, replacing it with brood
imported from California, and now Dr.
Hocking, of Alberta University, has
shown that the waste brood could be a
valuable food for humans. Bee-brood
has the same protein-content as steak,
10 times the vitamin-D equivalent of cod-
liver oil, and twice as much vitamin-A
as egg-yolk. After trying various methods
of preserving brood, such as salting and
pickling in vinegar, Dr. Hocking has
found quick-freezing and drying in the
oven the most successful. The pro-
cessed bees were flaky and resembled
breakfast - cereal, and members of a
testing-panel said that, fried in butter,
they were shrimplike in flavor, nutty and
like pork-crackling. Apparently it's not
the first time brood has been used for
food. Quarantine-officers of the Vic-
torian Department of Agriculture say
chocolate-coated baby-bees have been
imported into Australia from Japan,
along with such other exotic titbits as
fried ants, grasshoppers, caterpillars,
snails’-eggs and smoked frogs’-legs.

“Emel”: Eel was on the menu when
Riverside (Vic.) farmer Reg Peel picked

SURFBOARD STORY
The first surfboard to come to Australia
was imported in 1912 from Honolulu
by C. D. Paterson (for many years Surf
Life Saving Association president). This
proud piece of redwood, 9ft. long, ended
its days in the Paterson household as an
ironing-board
A few Sydney surfers of tnose days —
Jack Reynolds, Norman Roberts, Fred
Notting, “Looney” Walker (he was nick-
named “Looney” after he had dived into
the water to retrieve the bait for his fish
while the other fishermen managed to
catch the shark cruising around)—had
seen Paterson’s board and, though they
failed to master the technique of handling
it, they evolved boards of their own,
designed, they thought, to cope with the
heavier surf.
Les Hynes, a builder in Manly, built
them, solid with gothic-
shaped nose, a flat top and bottom with
rounded edges. This design indicated
that the only waves these pioneers
thought they could ride were “broken”
waves at low tide ; not a spectacle, and
not the sport as practised by the
Hawaiians.
Then, in 1914, the Australian Swim-
ming Association invited the Hawaiian
Duke Kahanamoku to swim here. As a
happy afterthought he was asked to give
an exhibition of surfboard-riding. He
didn’t have a surfboard with him, so he
made one here from sugar-pine. This
board was Bft. 6in. long and concave
underneath, purposely made that way by
Kahanamoku, who had run his experi-
enced eye over the Australian surf, and
was aiming for greater stability, our surf
being much rougher than the Hawaiian
variety.
One Sunday in February, 1915, he
arrived at Freshwater (now Harbord),
and by 10.30,, when he entered the water,
the beach and surrounding headlands
were thronged with people. Veteran
surfboard-rider Claude West recalls the
big sea running, but Kahanamoku didn’t
leave the water until early afternoon,
and he showed the crowd all the tricks
he knew. He added an extra. To
demonstrate that it was easy to have a
passenger on his board he took Isabel
Letham, a keen surfing lass, out with him
Together they vanquished that
tremendous sea; Isabel Letham thus
becoming the first Australian to ride a
surfboard, in the true sense, in the Aus-
tralian surf.
The pioneer surfboard-girl's self-
tuition thereafter was sans permission—•
Mr. Letham didn’t; he said, want his
daughter knocking anyone’s head off in
the surf. The lifesavers at Freshwater
saved her: they rang a bell whenever
Mr. Letham came beachward.
In those early days of surfboard-
riding the emphasis was on grace, and
this reached its peak when the board was
handled by such masters as Claude West,
“Snowy” McAllister, George Wilkinson
and Adrian Curlewis, followed by Lou
Morath, Freddie Boorman, Harry Wicke,
“Lofty” Sharpe, Ray Leighton and Fred
Notting, jnr. Worth noting by the way
that it was a matter of honor with all of
them never to let their boards go!
It could well be that the solid board
will soon be hard to find, even as a
museum-piece. There is a 561 b. one at the
Balmoral Beach Club, the one Lou
Morath took to Hawaii to compete in
the 1939 Pacific Games. The original
piece of concave sugar-pine used by
Duke Kahanamoku is a treasured relic
at the Freshwater Life Saving Club.

EXPANSION WITHOUT INFLATION
Tt is only a matter of time
before we would be con-
fronted by economic disaster
if Australia continued on the
present path of inflation,
according to the researchers
of the Institute of Public
Affairs Victoria whose quar-
terly review is, naturally
enough, devoted to inflation.
(The institute is a non-
profit organisation supported
entirely by voluntary contribu-
tions from business concerns
and people throughout Aus-
tralia, and aims at educat-
ing the public in the true facts
of our economic life to bring
about a wider understanding
of the merits of free business
enterprise.)
Expansion plus inflation, it
says, was an economic for-
mula that succeeded in the
1950’s only because of a
unique combination of circum-
stances which resulted in
world commodity prices being,
by and large, far above the
level of Australian costs.
This situation no longer
holds. In the 1960’s the for-
mula must be expansion
without inflation. Unless that
is observed there would,
before long, be no prospect
of expansion at all.
The price-rise over 1960
could be about double that
of the rate of the last few
years. The rebirth of infla-
tion is largely traceable to the
1959 basic-wage and margins
increases, which, together
made too big a meal for the
economy to swallow. These
awards meant an increase of
something like 7 per cent, in
the national wage-and-salary
bill —far in excess of any con-
ceivable gaifls in productivity.
Canberra has acted with
commendable promptitude,
although there are some
doubts about the wisdom of
the removal of import-restric-
tions. As _ far as coming
months are concerned, how-
ever, the damage has been
done, and recent cost-increases
are being worked-out, inevit-
ably, in higher prices.
For the future the endeavor
must be to ensure that the
total of money-incomes over
the whole economy increases
no faster than the goods and
services on which it can be
spent.
One of the weakest points
in our defences against infla-
tion is the fallacious notion
which abounds about the rate
of increased production over
the whole economy. This fal-
lacy is evident in the thinking
of governments, wage-fixing,
authorities, trade-unions and
employers.
In some industries, or. even
manufacturing as a whole,
spectacular gains may occa-
sionally occur, but this is
seldom true for the whole
economy. Manufacturing, after
all, makes up not more than
about a quarter of the
economy. In trade, finance,
Government services and some
public utilities, productivity
gains may be virtually non-
existent.
The average yearly rate of
increase in productivity is
unlikely to be much above
1 per cent. Yet since 1950
money-wages have increased
at an average rate of 8 per
cent, a year.
An expanding economy
requires huge quantities of
capital to employ, house, edu-
cate and provide for the
general health and welfare of
the rapidly growing population.
The heavy demand for capital
becomes superimposed on the
natural pressure for rising
standards.
The strong probability is
that the Australian economy
is just over-stretching itself in
the general urge for rapid
expansion and development.
To ignore this problem, or to
deny that it has any relevance
to inflation, is to run away
from the prospect of any real
solution.
A Weaker Sharemarket
/Coinciding with the forecast
by Staniforth Ricketson,
Melbourne sharebroker and
chairman of the various Capel
Court companies, that unless
new and unexpected factors of
a favorable nature arise in the
interim, lower values will be
ruling in the sharemarket by
June 30 next, Australian share
prices as a whole have been
decidedly weaker over the past
10 days.
In any case, many shares
had previously gone far too
high as a result of intense
speculation arising from un-
usual factors operating in the
economy. And by now it
should be clear that earning
profits is not just a bed of
roses for all the industries
listed on ’Change.
In B. 2/3/’6O, following the
first sharp market setback of
1960, the advice given to
market followers was “wait
and see.” The same advice
still applies, except where the
merits of a particular stock in
relation to its market price
clearly show it to be a bargain
Sulphates, Ltd.
Asa key industry supplying
expanding markets, Sul-
phates, Ltd., has not shown the
growth in profits one might
have expected over the past
few years. It seems to be just
short of a gallop. After reach-
ing a peak in the 1956-57 term
there was a setback in 1957-58,
and only partial recovery in
1958-59.
An interim ord. dividend at
the unchanged rate of 9 p.c
p.a. has just been declared.
The Sulphates group is en-
gaged in the mining of chemi-
cal-grade bauxite in the Mor-
well-Mirboo areas of Gipps-
land (Vic.) and the manufac-
ture of sulphates and alums, as
well as the construction of
water-purification plants, sew-
age-treatment equipment and
swimming-pools. A new pro-
duct has been patented and
introduced to the swimming-
pool field. Called Electro-Kal-
Cil, it aids and replaces filter
sand-beds, and imparts a
bright-blue color to the water.
The group’s patented pro-
cesses for the production of
filter-alum, papermaking-alum
and all grades of aluminium-
sulphate have been kept busy
as water-purification plants are
installed both publicly and
privately, the Australian paper-
making industry expands, and
general industrial activity
quickens.
But competition has also
grown keener, mostly on a
regional basis. In relation to
bulk and selling-prices, freight-
r a t e s —especially inter-State
freights—are high, and tend to
let-in competition on distant
markets. The co. has been ex-
ploring the possibility of sell-
ing or licensing its patented
processes overseas, but no deals
have yet been completed.
On the other hand, the
group has begun the manufac-
ture, under licence, of Rex
Chain Belt equipment in Aus-
tralia, as well as products of

the Pacific Flush Tank Co. of
Chicago. The co. is now in a
position to quote for a com-
plete range of sewage-treatment
and effluent-treatment equip-
ment.
The venture had its begin-
nings in 1918 with the object
of supplying aluminium-sul-
phate to the forebears of Aus-
tralian Paper Manufacturers,
Ltd. In 1922 Sulphates Pty.,
Ltd., was incorporated, a
chemical-works was set-up
alongside the Mt. Lyell acid-
works at Yarraville, bauxite
leases were acquired in Vic-
toria, and others later in
N.S.W. and Queensland. In
1931 a controlling-interest in
Alunite (Aus.) Pty., was bought,
and with it control of alunite
deposits at Alum Mountain, in
N.S.W.
The co.’s chemical-engineer-
ing subsidiary, Filtration and
Water Softening Pty., since its
formation in 1926 has carried-
out major water-filtration pro-
jects, including that for the
Brisbane water-supply, Austra-
lian Newsprint Mills (Tas.) and
Melbourne’s Olympic Pool.
Demand for this co.’s products
and services continues to grow,
and, with the present popularity
of private swimming-pools, it
should participate increasingly
in the building of them as well
as supplying the Cascade suc-
tion filtration-plants.
After allowing £25,279 (up
£223) for depreciation and
£27,124 (up £3478) for taxa-
tion, net profit for 1958-59 was
£4930 better than in 1957-58 at
£45,457, but still £12,274 lower
than the peak profit of £57,731
in 1956-57.
The 1958-59 result was equal
to 13.6 p.c. on the increased
average ordinary capital (after
providing for the 5y p.c. re-
quirements of the £lOO,OOO of
pref. money), compared with
15 p.c. in the preceding term.
For the fourth time in succes-
sion a 9 p.c. div. was paid.
Ordinary capital moved up
from £233,750 to £350,375 dur-
ing the year following the
exercise of 116,625 options
put-out in connection with the
issue of £116,875 of 6 p.c. un-
secured notes in 1953. A
9 p.c. distribution on the new
capital for a full year, plus the
pref. charge, would call for
*£37,033, or £8424 less than last
year’s disclosed profit.
The group at June 30 last
had long-term liabilities of
£127,823, and current liabilities
and provisions of £127,536. It
showed current assets of
£336,092, including £82,867 of
Government securities and
cash.
Freeholds were in the books
at £334,749, which is £149,000
less than a recent valuation.
Plant, experimental work, un-
completed capital projects, pat
terns, fittings, etc., totalled
£192,627, against which last
year’s £25,279 for depreciation
seems adequate. There are a
variety of intangibles, includ-
ing patents and research, tot-
ting-up to £62,977. Offsetting
these intangibles and deferred
expenditure there is £220,733
of reserves.
The Sulphates group has
reached a stage where profit-
able pay-off on expansion and
capital-expenditure which took
place three or four years ago
would be useful in helping to
support the recently increased
capital. Though the growth in
capital has been largely offset
by a drop in the interest-bear-
ing debt, servicing capital calls
for the earning of 9 p.c. after
paying 7s. 6d.-in-the-£ com-
pany-tax, whereas the redeemed
debt cost 6 p.c. or thereabouts,
tax-free.
Sulphates, Ltd., is an interest-
ing industrial enterprise, seem-
ingly well conducted technic-
ally, and is an investment with
possibilities as well as problems.
It appears to be increasing its
turnover in spite of competition
and inherent freight obstacles.
Periodically a small tax-free
ingredient comes in the divi-
dend. This arises from the
bauxite-mining section of the
enterprise.

N.K.S. Sells Noyes Shares
'T'he sale of its half-interest
J- (750,000 £1 shares) in
Noyes (Australia) Pty. to
Crompton Parkinson, Ltd.
(Eng.), for £656,250 cash by
N.K.S. Holdings, Ltd., will give
the English co. full control of
Noyes’ capital and will enable
N.K.S. to shed an investment
that has been a non-contributor
to profits ever since the flota-
tion of N.K.S. in 1954.
Noyes has been a distri-
butor of Crompton Parkinson
electric-motors and various
N.K.S.-group products, and
until it dropped some unprofit-
able lines in the 1958-59 term
it tended to run at a loss. More
recently it has been doing
better.
A summary of the activities
and prospects of N.K.S. was
given in B. 9/3/’6O. The
board announces that it will
use the £656,250 received from
the Noyes’ shares to go ahead
immediately with plans for
the other members of its
manufacturing and merchan-
dising group. Without any
assistance from the Noyes’
portfolio of shares the group
made a net profit equal to
11.1 p.c. on ord. capital in
1958-59 and paid an 8 p.c.
div.
The group is made up of
the merchandising company,
Knox Schlapp Pty., and sub-
sidiaries, and the manufactur-
ing offshoots, Ogden Industries
Pty., Metalex Pty., Australian
Die Castings Pty. and N.K.S.
Laboratories Pty.
A condition of the sale is
that the distribution rights of
products of the manufacturing
companies previously held
under agreement by the Noyes’
companies will revert to
N.K.S. Holdings, Ltd., other
than the distribution of Meta-
lex Pty., Ltd., products, which
is retained by Noyes Bros.
The Offer for Bruntons
A ssuming that the market-
price of 40s. for Tam-
worth (N.S.W.) flourmiller
George Fielder shares is
reasonable, then the offer of
one Fielder £1 ord., plus three
7 p.c. 20s. notes convertible
into ords. at par-value in 1965,
for every 20 Bruntons’ ss.
shares, appears to be a fair
one. Bruntons’ fractions will
be paid for at 6s. 6d. cash.
Reckoning the total con-
sideration to be worth 7s.
a share, it would be difficult
to place a much higher value
than that on Bruntons’ shares,
which have not been above
Bs. on ’Change for the past
five years.
Although the Bruntons’
board, at the last accounting,
said that the intrinsic worth
of the co.’s fixed assets was
above book-values, it should
be remembered that there was
a writing-up of assets in 1955,
when the book-value of free-
holds was more than doubled.
On book-valuations the net
tangible backing for each
Brunton share was 9s. 2d. at
February 28, 1959. But they
have not produced high or
consistent earnings since the
conversion into a public co.
occurred in 1951. On the

Black Jack
'“Fhe old Black Jack mine
(outside Charters Towers,
N.Q.) resurrected by Billy
Clark, Morgan Lewis, and the
rest, gave an output of 38,500
tons of ore for a yield of 39,000
fine ounces of gold in the
period 1934-1949, with the later
war years limiting development
and exhausting reserves of ore,
leading to liquidation.
Small syndicates in turn took-
over the mine, and in July last
the present owners (Gordon
Bros.) decided to close it down
—prior to the last increase in
the gold-bonus and a diamond-
drilling campaign projected by
the Mines Department when a
drill became available.
Apart from investigational
work by Broken Hill North,
practically the only other
mining in the area was at Lion-
town, 28 miles s.-w. of the
Towers, where gold-silver and
lead - copper ores are worked.
The gross values of the
base metals in comparison
with that of the gold renders
profits liable to income-tax,
with other attendant disabilities.
A Mines Department dia-
mond-drill is test-boring, as
did Broken Hill South a few
years ago on a paid option. In
both cases, drilling operations
were and are very difficult.

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
A cotton-spinning, -weaving
and -processing mill is to
be established in the South
Island at Nelson.
Announcing this at the
ceremony marking the begin-
ning of construction work on
the Nelson-Blenheim extension
of the South Island Main Trunk
railway, the Prime Minister,
Mr. Nash, said it would be a
beginning to Nelson’s new
period of growth as a manufac-
turing centre.
Initial capital-investment in
the mill will be about £2
million, rising to £4 million
within seven to eight years.
The sponsors are overseas
companies, but N.Z. investors
will be offered a share in the
equity.
In the first stage the mill will
produce meat-wraps, denim,
drills, and bleached sheetings
and pillow-cases, extending
later to flannelettes, wincey-
ettes and similar materials,
bleached, dyed and unbleached
yarn, shirtings, canvas and
duck, and towels, ticking and
similar products.
At first the mill will employ
about 300 workers and will
operate 24 hours a day over a
five-day week, but as produc-
tion develops in planned stages,
the labor requirements are ex-
pected to expand considerably.
According to Mr. Nash, the
products of the mill will be at
prices competitive with im-
ported goods, and their quality
will be up to world standards.
Distribution of the co.’s pro-
ducts will be through normal
trade channels, and it is in-
tended to export part of the
plant’s output.
'll/'ELCOMED in Nelson, the
project has had a mixed
reception elsewhere.
A spokesman for Federated
Farmers described it as “fan-
tastic.”
“Even the vast Lancashire
cotton industry is experiencing
great difficulties in the terrific-
ally competitive world of tex-
tile-marketing,” he said.
“In fact, the United King-
dom Government has been
forced to .spend £3O million to
close-down mills and generally
rationalise the industry.
“If Lancashire is finding the
going tough, what chance is
there for a New Zealand mill,
except under the shelter of a
massive protective barrier?
“In the Ottawa Agreement,
N.Z. promised the United
Kingdom that it would estab-
lish only those industries whose
products would have a reason-
able chance of being competi-
tive. A cotton industry in N.Z.
would hardly come within this
category.”
“The world trend in the
cotton industry is the establish-
ing of mills in the so-called
underdeveloped countries,
where labor costs are low. if
New Zealand is really sincere
in its efforts to assist these
countries, it should not enter
the field against them.”

ADELAIDE FESTIVAL-Second Week
T ike Edinburgh, Adelaide has
a compactness which con-
centrates culture in a small
area. You can walk easily
from Elder Park to the Bony-
thon Hall, and between these
points almost everything is
concentrated, except for the
Regent Theatre and Theatre
Royal (one block away) and
the Town Hall, where concerts,
recitals and parties have been
held.
The open-air concerts and
poetry - readings, the Public
Library book-show and poetry-
recordings, the art-shows, the
plays at the University’s Union
Theatre, the National Gallery
loan-exhibitions and “Murder
in the Cathedral” were all
close together, and lights and
traffic and beautifully dressed
crowds made the tree-lined
North Terrace like the Champs
Elysees at night.
Adelaide has never seen any-
thing like it. I think the women
enjoyed it most; there is so
rarely an opportunity to “dress
up” here. They dragged their
husbands out night after night,
and it was not only the visitors
who caused every show to be
booked-out.
At the last public poetry-
reading arranged by the S.A.
Fellowship of Writers people
were actually turned away be-
cause the Mawson Theatre was
full —due largely to the attrac-
tion of Kenneth Slessor and
Douglas Stewart, besides Tom
Inglis Moore and some well-
known South Australians,
reading their own work.
The second open-air reading
by the river was such a suc-
cess that an anonymous
donor came forward with a
sum to assure regular lunch-
hour readings in Elder Park
every month until the winter.
“Rigoletto”
The second opera-offering,
“Rigoletto,” was somewhat
gloomy fare, with sombre light-
ing and costuming rather too
garish in the crowd-scenes ;
but Glenda Raymond’s sing-
ing was like sunlight through
clear water. As Gilda she sang
the famous “Caro Nome” aria
with effortless grace and looked
uniformly charming, petite and
appealing.
Rigoletto, played by tall and
handsome Ronal Jackson, was
almost too sympathetic,
missing the sinister qualities of
this character. Donald Smith,
as the “licentious young Duke,”
was a bit heavy-footed, though
light enough of voice. This
opera loses by being translated
into English ; short syllables
like “girl” and “love” have to
be stretched on the rack to
equal “ragazza” and “amore.”
“II Trittico” (three short operas
of Puccini) come next.
West Indian Play
“Moon on a Raipbow
Shawl,” at the Union Theatre,
is the London “Observer”
prize-play, with a West Indian
slum-setting. It is beautifully
acted, with a brilliantly casual
set by Ostoja-Kotkowski, and
the dialogue and presentation
are so natural that you have
the illusion of looking in on
a real backyard, and through
the fly-screen windows into
real homes. All the charac-
ters are completely amoral, ex-
cept for old Sophia and her
young daughter. Nita Panned,
as Sophia Adams, carries much
of the play’s humor and
tenderness on her capable
shoulders.
Like real life, the play solves
nothing and makes no point,
except perhaps that human-
beings should not have to live
in such overcrowded, squalor.
The lilt of the West Indian
idiom, as in Ralph de Bois-
siere's novels, makes for fresh-
ness and charm though
Audine Leith drops into pure
Irish now and then.
Lois Marshall’s recital at the
Town Hall was a musical event,
her magnificent soprano rang-
ing from Handel and Purcell
to three modern settings of
poems by James Joyce. There
were also the sultry Italian
violinist Gioconda de Vito and
the sparkling French pianist
Philippe Entremont.
Then there were the puppets.
Young and old have been
filling the Tivoli Theatre to see
these amazing mannikins,
manipulated by Ann Hogarth
and Jan Bussell, her tall and
bearded husband, who puts on
whole scenes from “Macbeth”
by himself.
It’s all been a little too much,
and most people are looking
forward to a few good nights’
sleep ; but we still have Joan
Hammond in “Madame Butter-
ffly” to come—like a good
liqueur to look forward to after
our unprecedented feast of art.
Nancy Cato.

Chevalier
The Sydney Empire curtain
rose on an empty stage ; an
unseen piano knitted strands
of Chevalier songs into an
overture; the lights slowly
changed colors. Where was
he? A perceptible straining
forward as the seconds moved
towards a minute . . . and at
last he appeared.
The audience rolled a wel-
come at the blue suit and the
bow-tie, the pink cheeks under
the boater ; there was a hint
of surprise in their delight, as
if they had never quite believed
it would really be him —or as if
the Eiffel Tower painted on
the backdrop had somehow
materialised. A little tuning-in
with some patter about his 71y
years and he had quickly
established a rapport with the
crowd—a rapport which he
maintained, with astonishing
alertness and skill, almost
throughout.
Much of his one-man show
is given to recreating his own
powerful legend. He holds it
tenderly up to us, turning it
this way and that, with a laugh
or a smiling regret, breathing
life into the audience’s past as
much as into his own. As he
sings the songs and shuffles
the dances out of the films that
made him famous the years
sometimes fall away from him,
and an old photograph comes
to life before one’s eyes: the
’twenties, the ’thirties live
again. But the ’fifties of the
fatherly Chevalier are not for-
gotten: there are some songs
from, and table-talk about,
“Love in the Afternoon,”
“Gigi” and the forthcoming
“Can-Can” to round-out the
picture and put a friendly arm

around the young who only
know that part of the story.
This much of the show is
shamelessly, but never shame-
fully, ingratiating: it works
like the flattery of one who
really likes people' and there
is as little substance to it as
there was to the white bonbons
and the vials of French scent
they presented to the women
on the way in.
But, as The Bulletin’s
Melbourne reviewer has re-
marked, there are also glimpses
of another Chevalier a
Chevalier from the old music-
hall past, from behind the
image of international fame.
This is the acute observer of
life and manners who sketches
in mime some audiences he has
known; mimics the sounds of
languages heard for the first
time ; sends the audience out
at interval with a vivid dumb-
show of what we mostly do in,
and just off, the foyer; and
sings about the illusions of
passion and about a pair of
lovers who, though too poor
to do more than sniff at wine-
barrels, react to each vintage
like any pair of millionaires.
This is the Chevalier whose
art springs from the streets,
bars and cabarets as much as
from his own personality;
and as one who was too young
to be thoroughly infected by
“Innocents in Paris,” etc., the
present reviewer would like to
have seen much more of him.
J. A
Malko and Marshall
“A concord of sweet sounds,”
Shakspeare called music, and
that is a definition difficult to
apply to Australian composer
Dorian Le Gallienne’s “Con-
cert Overture,” with which the
Sydney Orchestra under Nicolai
Malko began the Blue Series of
its first subscription-concert of
the season. True, the work is
well orchestrated, and it has
brevity and a certain frenetic
vigor. But it remains, on the
whole, just a mass of sound,
practically tuneless through-
out.
“Le Bourgeois Gentil-
homme,” the orchestral suite
adapted from the revised opera
“Ariadne and Naxos,” is
Richard Strauss at near the
lighthearted best of his middle
period—a piece whose engag-
ing tunes and lovely harmonies
tend to disguise the tensile
strength of its basic structure.
Here Malko, if not exactly
giving the orchestra its head
over much of it, at least seemed
to hold the reins slightly less
taut, and the result was spon-
taneity. But in the Fencing
Master section he made no
bones about ensuring that the
brasses were allowed no more
than the needed weight to gain,
a beautifully balanced effect.
The whole piece was a fine
example of musical joyousness
never stepping over into boister-
ousness.
The big work of the night,
Beethoven’s “Eroica” Sym-
phony, was given a reading of
which the most satisfying
aspect was the restrained
emotionalism heightening the
grandeur of the Funeral
March; in this movement, too,
Malko’s musicianship came
close to its best expression in
the treatment of the fugal part
at the beginning of the central
section.
Something less than its due
titanic strength was allotted
the thunders and contentions of
the opening movement. The
scherzo had more than a hint
of Bacchic laughter, and the
final variation - form allegro
found the lower strings at close
to their best form.
Canadian lyric soprano Lois
Marshall made her bow to
Sydney audiences in Ravel’s
Suite for Orchestra and
Soprano, “Scheherezade.” Re-
vealing a voice of easy pro-
duction and top quality over a
gamut extending down with-
out being forced into notes
which are usually the preserve
of the mezzo-contralto, she
succeeded in capturing almost
to the full the Gallic subtlety
of these three songs: “Asia,”
“The Enchanted Flute” and
“The Indifferent One.” The
conductor here effected a neat
balance between the human
and instrumental voices.
“School for Scandal”
Memories of the Oliviers
having faded and a new genera-
tion of theatregoers come up,
Brisbane’s Twelfth Night
Theatre felt it was about time
to scrape the moss off this
cornerstone of British comedy
and show just why it still has
the power to attract full houses
and send them away with a
renewed belief in the power of
live theatre.
The play makes no great
demands upon sheer acting
ability—those characters that
lie nearer to caricature should
be presented a little larger than
life ; for the rest, their charms
are both vocal and visual.
It was a pity that in the pre-
sent production the Lady
Sneerwell-Snake set was not
more patently malicious. If
one may mix metaphors, this
opening scene, feathering the
viper’s nest, wasn’t barbed
enough, and an indistinct
Snake left a disagreeable im-
pression— not of the role but
of the performer.
Enter Blanche Lather, as
Mrs. Candour in full sail, and
the Sheridan comedy started!
Some may say she overplayed,
but her sheer vigor and speed,
her exaggerated gestures, made-
up for the deficiencies of the
opening scene and for the
anaemic fussiness of her en-
tourage.
James Stevens, as Sir Peter,
had the advantages of authori-
tative diction, but, as in
his “Bourgeois Gentilhomme,”
seemed to miss the sense of
period. His portrayal emerged
as modern, not 18th-century
with a meaning for all subse-
quent centuries as well.
Not so Gwen Wheeler, as
his Lady. Her understanding
of the role is simply what Bris-
bane has come to expect from
her And if the years have led
us to accept the professional
quality of her work, nothing in
the past could have anticipated
Barry Creyton’s performance
of the most difficult role in
the play—Joseph Surface. Bris-
bane has for some years faced
a shortage of young men with
the flair and grace necessary
for classical comedy. Creyton,
and to a lesser degree a more
relaxed Mervyn Littmann,
augur well for this year.
Sets and costumes, with the
exception of a few, lapses in
materials and wiggery, showed
some imagination ; but, beyond
the “stars” mentioned, many
of the minor roles were
inarticulate and clumsy —in-
tolerable in a play where it is
so often the function of these
“confidantes” to further the
plot by narration.

Sydney Art
Sydney art for the week
consists of Juraj Pandol at the
Clune Galleries, the Contem-
poraries at David Jones’ and
Donald Friend at the Mac-
quarie an exceptionally
rewarding lot of paintings.
Juraj Pandol is in a mild
way a phenomenon. We are
continually expecting new
arrivals from Europe to be
glittering with the culture of
the Old World, and generally
they aren’t; but Pandol, who
has only been six weeks in
Australia and who was born
in Dalmatia, is—if not exactly
likely to set the Harbor on
fire—a genuine artist.
His derivations from Van
Gogh and Gauguin do not seem
enterprising at this date—
though whether it is really
better to follow the outdated
fashion of the “college,” as
Elwyn Lynn and Thomas
Gleghorn are doing at the
Contemporaries’ show, than
to follow the Impressionists, is
a moot point—but his flowers
and landscapes are good of
their kind. Beyond that he
has style, an engaging sense
of fantasy, the ability to
handle fireworks, and his
“Frightened Horses” is a
beautiful painting in any
language.
The Contemporaries seem
livelier on the whole than in
the past few years, and every
now and again they strike a
happy balance between the
abstract that means nothing
except design and the abstract
or semi-abstract that puts a
new slant on reality: notably

“The Captain’s Daughter”
This Russian film, based on
the Pushkin novel, demon-
strates once again that in the
hands of master-craftsmen the
black-and-white camera is still
a very potent force in cinema-
tography, and that in the realm
of the historical novel Russian
film-makers are very much at
home.
There is an easy cogency in
the telling of this story o
an officer in the Army o
Catherine the Great whos
chance friendly act to a wa>
side wanderer imperils his lif
when the object of his bene
factions turns out to be th
Pretender to the throne,
strange concatenation of cir
cumstances making it appea
that he has been guilty o]
treason.
The atmosphere of Ole
Russia is faithfully maintained
the characters and their motive
are projected with sharp
clarity, and there is a crowd
scene at the climactic behead
ing of the Pretender which i
moving and gripping.
Sergei Luckyanov, as the Pre-
tender, dominates every scene
he is in. Iya Arepina acts sen-
sitively as the daughter of the
fortress captain to whose com
mand the young officer is
initially sent. The hero is
played no more than ade-
quately by Oleg Strizhenov.

“Tiger Bay”
This British thriller departs
from convention by having
the only witness to an un-
premeditated crime of passion,
a 10-year-old girl, accompany
the guilty fugitive as a volun-
tary hostage. The child be-
comes almost the central figure,
and the portrayal of her strange
character —able to lie with a
wide-eyed innocent look when
the occasion demands; holding
strongly to a sense of loyalty
beyond her years to the man
for whom she develops a
childish affection —brings a per-
formance of remarkable con-
viction and judgment from
Hayley, daughter of John Mills.
(Mills plays the investigating
detective-superintendent).
Young German actor Horst
Buchholz, as the Polish sailor
fleeing from British justice -
inherently decent but an un-
lucky victim of circumstances
—wins considerable sympathy
with his handling of a role
which allows him to move
authoritatively from moments
of tenderness to intense drama.
Tight direction, effective
black-and-white camera-work,
a strongly knit story with a
good final punch and no loose
ends, plus well-held suspense,
make this a thoroughly like-
able film whose only weakness
is a tendency to spin-out a
couple of episodes unneces-
sarily.

Clyde Industries, Ltd.
r T''HE snowballing Clyde Industries, Ltd.,
has been making-out very well in
the post-war period. Formed as Clyde
Engineering, Ltd., in 1898, the co. is a
successful light- and heavy-engineer,
engineering-merchant and consultant. The
group (in which the parent Clyde
Industries is a holding-co.) is becoming
increasingly diversified. Manufacturing
activities include the production of
diesel - electric locomotives, railway-
coaches, motor-bodies, bridges, car-
batteries, garage-equipment, hydraulic
pumps and valves, aluminium kitchen-
ware and plywood and veneers.
The group also assembles Renault’s
Dauphine cars, distributes various
engineering products and holds a 24| p.c.
interest in Volkswagen (Aust.) Pty. and
a 50 p.c. interest in Fruehauf Trailers
(Aust.) Pty., manufacturers of road-
trailers, flexivans, etc. >
The group's subsidiaries include:
A. C. Willard and Co. Pty. (manufacturers for
the food, textile and chemical industries).
Apac Industries, Ltd. (jacks and greasing equip-
ment) . y
Automatic Electric Telephones Pty.
Clyde Batteries Pty.
Clyde Constructions Pty.
John Carruthers and Co. Pty. (consulting engi-
neers).
Martin and King Industries Pty. (motor-bodies and
rolling-stock).
Material Handling Pty. (tractors and earthmoving
equipment).
Paul and Gray Pty. (ship-chandlery and mer-
chandising).
Proofwood Pty. (plywood and veneer manufac-
turers).
The Clyde Engineering Co. Pty. (manufacturing
diesel-electric locomotives under licence from General
Motors Corp., U.S.A.).
Westeels Industries, Ltd. (boilers, steam-cleaners
and machine-tools).
Last term Clyde acquired three more
cos. by exchange of shares: Fowler
Constructions, Ltd. (a group distributing
heavy earthmoving equipment, manu-
facturing hydraulic pumps, etc., and a
major producer of bitumen roadmaking
products) ; Raco Corporation Pty.
(aluminium hollow-ware products); and
Norman N. Benson and Co. Pty. (distri-
butor of engineering machine-tools with
several agency-lines).
British Standard Machinery Co., Ltd.,
was acquired after balance-date.
Intense competition prevailed in heavy
engineering and locomotive and rolling-
stock manufacture, and the co. was
unable to obtain ’‘sufficient orders to
absorb the capacity” of its huge Granville
plant. Last year Clyde received an order
for six Mainline diesel-electric loco-
motives from N.S.W. Railways.
Activities of the operating subsidiaries
were generally successful, except those of
Proofwood Pty., which “is being closely
examined” in relation to its future
activity, and of Martin and King
Industries Pty.
The earning-figures present a bit of a
paradox. Group-profit, before providing
for depreciation, amortisation, taxation
and directors’ fees, was £116,967 lower
at £1,189,761. However, consolidated net
profit for the year ended June 30, 1959,
was disclosed to be £58,080 higher at
£605,353, an increase of about 10 p.c.
and the highest net earnings yet shown:

This was after making a lower provision
for depreciation and amortisation (down
£15,408 at £288,351) and paying sub-
stantially less tax (down £167,633 at
£281,597).
Although last year’s tax-provision
seems somewhat low, and the preceding
one rather high, it is difficult to draw
any conclusions, because of complica-
tions with the numerous subsidiaries.
Thus consolidated net profit was ad-
versely affected by the termination half-
way through the year of the assembly of
Volkswagen vehicles by subsidiary
Martin and King Industries Pty. Losses
were incurred through dislocation and
increased production-costs resulting from
the transfer of the subsidiary’s remain-
ing manufacturing activities to temporary
premises at Fishermen’s Bend (Vic.),
pending the erection of a new plant at
Somerton (Vic.).
Unchanged pref. - divs. absorbed
£30,000, leaving £575,350 to the ord.
.shareholders, equivalent to an earning-
rate of 22.1 p.c. on the higher average
ord. capital, compared with 24.3 p.c. in
the previous term, and 21.8, 18.8 and
18.7 p.c. back to 1955. Ord. div.-rate
was lifted to 15 p.c.
Reserves benefited by £185,127 and by
£6918 reduction in intangibles (to
£25,379), £413,483 increase in book-value
over cost of shares in subsidiaries, and
£150,000 “subsidiaries’ plant-depreciation
written-back.”
Paid capital was lifted to £3,277,669
(including £300,000 5 p.c. first prefs. and
£300,000 5 p.c. second prefs.) by the issue
of £7o79jn ss. ords. at par in acquisition
of further shares in Westeels Industries,
Ltd., £341,450 in ss. ords at par to
purchase Fowler Constructions, Ltd., and
£62,805 in ss. ords. in payment for
Norman N. Benson and Co. Pty. Another
£49,996 in ss. ords. was issued to the
staff fund on acquisition of Raco Cor-
poration Pty.
The balance-sheet reflects the strong
financial position of the rapidly expand-

J. C. Ludowici and Son, Ltd.
The second century in business began
well for this industrial-leather and
power-transmission merchant and manu-
facturer.
Incorporated in 1891, and converted
to a public co. 20 years later, J. C.
Ludowici and Son, Ltd., has not passed
a dividend since its first year of business.
The co. began as a tanner, but the scope
of its activities has been steadily expand-
ing, and now includes pulleys, drives,
bearings, gears, industrial gloves and
other power-transmission accessories.
Recently the co. began to manufacture
synthetic elastometer products for a wide
range of industrial applications, and now
has a full engineering and supervisory
staff controlling the production of moulds
and “tools of extreme accuracy and
precision.” The moulds are used in the
co.’s plastics division which produces
Lurene hydraulic packings.
“Further developments” occurred in
the production of polytetrafluoroethylene
parts, marketed under the brand-name of
Lupac-F, and generally known to the
industry as Fluon or Teflon. In addition,
the co. holds agency lines for some
switchgear and electric motors.
J. C. Ludowici has had a rather unpre-
dictable course of profits in the past,
being subject to the market for hides and
leather and the vagaries of fluctuating
industrial demand. However, the board
has earned a reputation for the fairness
with which it dispenses the co.’s fortunes
among its shareholders.
The last two years have been marked
by an upward trend in earnings. Net
profit for the year ended December 31,
1959, was £11,656 higher at £46,707, after
writing-off £14,368 for depreciation (up
£3650) and providing a lump £30,000 for
taxation (up £10,000):

After satisfying the steady pref.-div.
requirements (£5500), the earning-rate on
the average ord. capital was almost 33
p.c., compared with 23.6 p.p. in the
previous term, and 15.4 p.c., 23.9 p.c.,
28.1 p.c., 24.7 p.c. and 12.5 p.c. for the
preceding five years back to 1953. The
ord. div.-rate was steady at 15 p.c. (in
1958 a special 2\ p.c. centenary loading
was added to the basic rate).
Freeholds were written-down by
£11,341, £2OOO was transferred to reserve
for doubtful debts and £4OOO to the staff-
fund. A capital - profit of £12,605 was
made on the sale of the rear section of
the co.’s Melbourne warehouse.
Paid capital remained a modest
£225,000, including £50,000 5 p.c. cum.
20s. first prefs. and £50,000 6 p.c. cum.
20s. second prefs. This was backed by
£334,056 reserves, free of intangibles.

Bank accommodation was £51,255 down
at £36,433, but creditors increased by
£17,513 to £91,272. Borrowings secured
by mortgage were £22,408 higher at
£71,291.
Stock-values varied little, but sundry
debtors, etc., increased by £18,640 to
£148,352. Working-capital was £186,013,
and the current ratio 2.2 to 1.
Book-values of freehold and plant
showed the, effect of consistent write-offs
and heavy depreciation provisions.
Towards the end of last term a new
office-block was completed at the co.’s
works at Lane Cove, near Sydney. Modi-
fication of existing premises is continuing.
Expenditure on building projects in the
current term is expected to be heavy.
The co.’s chairman says that finance “to
meet these costs and to provide capital
for increased sales will be available from
within the co.”
The co. is hopeful that this year’s earn-
ings will increase steadily as “further
planned developments” begin to take
shape. The co. is no longer completely
dependent on the production of leather
and its mechanical end-product's. New
lines were introduced by the industrial
gloves division, including the patented
Lucel glove, developed by J. C.
Ludowici’s staff.
The co.’s cautious but steady growth,
and the growing demands made by the
expanding organisation on the modest
capital funds, may lead to an increase in
share-capital which has remained
unchanged since 1952.
J. C. Ludowici’s ord. scrip is rated
high on the sharemarket. At the last
sale in Sydney the 20s. ords. fetched 655.
each. The immediate yield is 4.6 p.c.
on the basis of the 15 p.c. div.-rate. The
20s. 5 p.c. cum. prefs. last changed hands
at 17s. a unit. There was no recent
trading in the second prefs.
Net tangible asset-backing works out
at £3 13s. sd. for each 20s. ord.
Australian Stock Breeders Co., Ltd.
D ising world populations and living-
standards have lifted world consump-
tion of beef greatly in recent years—l -
million metric tons in 1952 ; 24.8-million
metric tons in 1956 ; and now higher
still. While demand is likely to continue
to expand, variations in supply can be
expected to cause price-fluctuations.
Beef-production is so greatly influenced
by seasonal conditions and by various
governmental arrangements with pro-
ducers, and takes so long to respond to
changes in prices, that stability can
hardly be expected. Production of beef
in the major consuming-countries (the
U.K. and U.S.A.) is subject to these fluc-
tuations, so that the margin between local
production and consumption, which is
filled by imports, can vary widely.
In 1952, when the 15-year Meat Agree-
ment was made with the U.K., Australia
could look forward to a guaranteed
market for its meat and some measure
of price-stability. Although recent nego-
tiations under the agreement resulted
in lower minimum prices for beef and
veal from 1961 to 1964 —down 9 p.c.
on the 1958-59 level —U.K. demand for
Australian beef (chilled and frozen,
but especially chilled) has improved, and
prices have risen above the minimums
prescribed. This stems principally from
the drastic reduction of beef-exports by
Argentina, and is supported by lower pro-
duction in Britain and by diversion of
much of New Zealand’s trade to the U.S.
market. Argentine herds had been seri-
ously depleted under strain of heavy
exports and excessive home consump-
tion, and though cattle-numbers are
gradually increasing, everything points
to a general world-wide shortage of beef
for the next year or so.
As a result of the negotiations
under the U.K. agreement Australia
has the right to export first- and second-
grade beef up to 7500 tons a year (“the
beef free-quota”), during 1961-64, to
markets other than the U.K., and also has
unrestricted licence to export lower
grades, with no limit on quantity.
Conclusion of negotiations came at a
most opportune time. In 1957 the U.S.
cattle industry suffered a severe setback,
with drought conditions taking heavy toll
of herds. Consumer-demand could only
be satisfied by large-scale importing. Last
year Australia shipped 100,000 tons of
beef to the U.S. —in 1956, shipments
totalled only 1500 tons. Most of the beef
comprised lower-grade, leaner varieties
as used in the manufacturing (hamburger)
business, and, paradoxically, prices
fetched were better in most instances


than those obtained for Australia's firsf-
quality beef on the U.K. market.
But can Australia count on a permanent
market in the U.S. 1 / Certainly the ten-
dency in America towards more casual
eating-habits (hamburger lines) continues,
and U.S. herds, now approaching re-
habilitation, constitute first- rather than
second-grade beef. Just as certainly,
high prices obtaining in the U.S. will
not last for ever. As domestic supply
more closely approximates demand,
prices must fall. This, then, appears to
be the main problem confronting Aus-
tralian cattlemen. Will Australia be
costed out of the U.S. market by inability
to lower prices?
The Australian Stock Breeders’ Co.
own a chain of five breeding-properties,
together with a stud- and fattening-
property. This cattle-kingdom comprises
some of the most difficult stock-country
in the world. It stretches from back
of Cairns (N.Q.) to the hinterland of the
Gulf, a region parched and thirsty
for most of the year; watered, when
fortune smiles, by an unreliable “wet.”
Natural pastures are poor, fences are few
and marauding scrubbers throw breeding-
plans askew. Foddering cattle is un-
economic.
Despite such inherent difficulties, Aus-
tralian Stock Breeders has made much
progress in recent years. . Tank-projects
have been completed, and all holdings,
now, are assured some supply of water.
Last year the co. bought Thorntonia, ,a
breeding-property at Camooweal, plus
its Shorthorn stock. The season was
moderate, with less-than-average rain-
falls on all properties. Good relief-
rains, falling since, have saved the situa-
tion. Brandings rose by 3560 to 15,816,
and turnoff in fat bullocks and cows by
601 to 6745. Closing stock of cattle rose
from 67,066 in ’SB to 81,402 last year.
Stud-cattle numbers, included in these
figures, went up from 1877 head to 1899.
Profits have risen steadily from the
1956 low, last term lifting £2719 above
the ’SB showing £46,402. Reserves went up
by £59,873 to £180,475, and included, in
addition to undistributed profits (£26,691),
£33,182 from revaluation of cattle on
Thorntonia. Earning-rate on ord. capital
(after covering the div. on prefs., pre-
viously 6.2 p.c., now 8.2 p.c.) reflects the
fall and subsequent improvement of
profits: 34.5 p.c., 33.9, 23.57 and 38.8
p.c. back to 1955. The ord. div.-rate was
lifted from 8 p.c. to 10 p.c.
Last term’s profits have been reckoned
after depreciation written-off leaseholds
and improvements, £13,880 (up £325 on
’SB) and tax provision, amount unstated:

Rosella Preserving and Manufactur-
ing Co., Ltd.
■Cor a long time now the terms of trade
have been steadily turning against
primary-producers and the associated
industries. A respite occurred during the
war and in the early post-war years,
when starved, war - devastated Europe
hungrily gulped-down all the food that
could be produced. The great interna-
tional relief-agencies, such as U.N.R.R.A.
(really the U.S. taxpayers), footed most
of the bill.
Since then the situation has become
increasingly difficult. Supply in excess
of effective demand steadily weakened
international prices. For several years
now foodstuffs - producers, including
Rosella, have encountered difficulties
inherent in a buyers’ market, both at
home and abroad.
The U.K. has been the traditional
export-market for Australian fresh and
canned fruit, jams, marmalades, etc.
This outlet is now subject to severe
competition from other major fruit-
growers and fruit-goods producers, parti-
cularly South Africa and the U.S.
In addition there are the usual compli-
cations of primary-producers —weather
conditions, cost of seasonal labor, storage
of bumper-crops, transport, etc., and,
above all, the virtual inability to regulate
supply.
In these circumstances Rosella is doing
pretty well, although there has been a
marked tendency for the earnings to edge-
down in the last four years. x
Floated as a public co. in 1910, the
Victorian-registered Rosella Preserving
and Manufacturing Co., Ltd., is one of
the leading food-processors and canners
in Australia.
With factories and warehouses at Rich-
mond, Tatura (Vic.), Rosebery, Windsor
(N.S.W.), North Terrace (S.A.) and
Hobart (Tas.), the co. markets jams,
marmalades, soups, sauces, canned fruits,
tinned foodstuffs and special diabetic
sugarless foods.
To increase its turnover Rosella has
consistently modernised its plant and
warehouses and increased its expendi-
ture on advertising. Construction of
refrigeration-rooms for the cool-storage
of limited quantities of fresh fruit was
commenced recently and will be ready
for use during the present fruit season.
Consolidated operating net profit for
the year ended September 30, 1959, slipped
down by £18,021 to £290,590, after charg-
ing £53,397 for depreciation (almost
steady) and paying all other expenses.
Miscellaneous income amounted to
£1234
After setting aside £4313 less for taxa-
tion (£105,274) consolidated net profit
edged-down by £13,929 to £186,550:

From Herbert Holman
The Crossman affair, although
it has further exposed the
rifts and fissions in the Labor
party, had little effect on the
result of the controversy over
Clause 4. Of the 26 members
of the executive who attended
the meeting, one only voted
against the composite declara-
tion which includes, but
waters-down, the now strange
device of nationalisation.
No one was —or will ever
be —surprised at Dick Cross-
man’s vicissitudes. A brilliant
man who yet has no apparent
fixed sense of purpose, he has
given the impression of being
more often out-of-step than
not.
The paradox is that the
backgrounds of Crossman and
Gaitskell are identical. Both
are about the same age, both
overlapped at Winchester and
New College (where the former
became Fellow and Dean),
both joined the Labor party
in their early twenties, both
came to know the working-
classes through W.E.A. lectures
and both were elected to Par-
liament in 1945.
After that their paths
diverged. Gaitskell moved
steadily but quickly upwards,
while Crossman survived only
a short while as a junior
Minister before Attlee re-
moved him. In the last two
years or so, though, he has
come to the front in the double
capacity as promoter of the
Labor plan for State pensions
and also, strengthened by his
skill as a journalist, as propa-
gandist and campaignist. He
has always concerned himself
with foreign affairs and
defence and, in fact, it was the
statement of his individual
views on the latter that brought
about his dismissal.
A further circumstance —
and one of the embarrass-
ments so typical of the Labor
party —is that Crossman is its
vice-chairman. He will be
chairman next year if he is re-
elected to the national
executive.
One is forced to wonder if
Gaitskell (who, Heaven knows,
has troubles enough) took this
into consideration when he
made his decision. For Cross-
man, though personally
amiable and well-meaning, has
no following and treads any-
thing but delicately on people’s
corns. Unlike such automatic
choices as Aneurin Bevan,
Harold Wilson and Barbara
Castle, his re-election to the
executive is by no means
automatic.
Every Man a Capitalist
The Wider Share Ownership
Committee, formed 18 months
ago, has 30 members whose
names make an imposing list.
Under the chairmanship of the
Prime Minister’s son, Parlia-
ment, the City and industry
are strongly represented.
In association with Mr.
Harold Wincott and 10
specialist colleagues, the secre-
tary, George Copeman, Ph.D.,
has written a pamphlet, “The
Growing Popularity of Share
Ownership,” which summar-
ises, concisely and authorita-
tively, the development of
small investment, individually
and collectively, through the
various types of co-partnership
schemes. While there is little
factually that will be new to
the sophisticated investor, the
impetus behind the movement
and the implications from a
between-the-lines reading are
considerable.
The most significant implica-
tion is “that when a popular
movement grows, it tends to
gain legislative concessions
which help its further growth.”
Instanced are private trans-
port (putting car-owners, as
voters, in a strong position to
demand improved roads and
parking facilities), house-
ownership, life-assurance and
pension schemes.
As more and more people
become interested in buying
shares, runs the argument, the
Government will in turn
become more sympathetic
towards them. The heavy
stamp-duty (£2 per cent.) on
transfers, for “was
imposed at a time when invest-
ment in shares, and Stock
Exchange transactions, were
unpopular with the Govern-
ment and a considerable sec-
tion of the electorate ; but now
the position has reversed.”
“There are many who
argue,” continues the pamph-
let, “that all forms of saving
for retirement or adversity
should be entitled to the same
tax-concessions.” This leads,
by logical processes, to the
final suggestion that every tax-
payer should be allowed a
“special tax - concession
account” with a bank or other
financial concern, which will
provide for, say, 25 per cent,
of his annual income, but
“within that limit he may have
a wide choice of investment
in pension policies; life-
insurance, unit-trusts, company
shares or other media.”
In sum, the objectives of-
this strong but dignified
pressure-group are, broadly,
to establish that share-owner-
ship is not only respectable
but desirable and also on a
par with the Government’s
own national-savings schemes ;
to encourage the masses to
share in the future prosperity
of industry; and to mop-up,
in the form of regular and
individual savings, a sizeable
proportion of the wage-
packets.
There are many ingenious
ideas, depending upon one
form or another of State co-
operation, if not of legisla-
tion, which have greater force
because of the unawareness,
unsophistication and gulli-
bility of the small investor.
If the Chancellor of the
Exchequer does not act upon
them it will certainly not be
because they have not been
brought to his notice.
Mama Blossoms-out
Some of the more austere
critics tumbling enforcedly
from the high tragedy of Mme.
Marie Bell’s three-week season
of Racine to modern American
comedy, have dismissed “A
Majority of One” (Phoenix
Theatre) rather contemptu-
ously but, in one opinion at
least, unfairly.
It is true that, in a cold,
intellectual light, the play is
tushy and that all the cliches
of sentimental romance have
been marshalled and refur-
bished. Old, bitter enemies
bury the hatchet. Mother-in-
law reluctantly accompanies
her daughter and her husband
across the seas, naively hinders
the latter’s progress and then
intervenes to pull-off an even
bigger deal for his and Old
Glory’s sake. The high-
sounding talk is embarrassing
to sit through, and the con
struction, by modern standards,
is altogether too neat and
contrived.
Yet, for all its ingenuous-
ness, the message comes home
with naturalness and tender-
ness and the improbability of
the main situation is quaint
rather than ridiculous, thereby
heightening the fantasy.
A more explanatory title
would be “Koichi’s Yiddisher
Lotus Flower,” for, believe it
or not, a Russo-American
Jewess, grandmotherly by
nature if not yet by fact,
becomes platonically involved
with a lonely Japanese million-
aire, despite her antipathy to
his race (her son was killed
by the Japs; his son and
daughter by the Americans).
It must be said, in extenua-
tion, that the tragic theatre
holds no monopoly of good
actresses. Forty years on the
lighter stage, most of them in
song and dance, is the record
of Molly Picon, who plays
Mrs. Jacoby with such affec-
tion, tenderness and power
that the audience is in her
hand, alternately laughing and
crying with her.
She is well supported by an
actor who, despite the sallow
make-up and slanting eye-
brows, unmistakeably has the
appearance of Robert Morley.
Nonetheless, the gravity,
studied politeness and vocal
peculiarity which restrict his
performance are delicately
balanced and never seem other
than delightfully natural;
moreover, he achieves an
astonishing variety of expres-
sion in this most narrow
gamut.
If the sentimentality occa-
sionally cloys and the family
clashes appear contrived, the
comedy is always pointed and
rich. Particularly amusing and
touching is the visit of Mrs.
Jacoby to Koichi Asano’s
house. Miss Picon even
triumphs over the unnecessary
ordeal of having to get
slightly drunk through drink-
ing sake as if it were tea.
A pleasant evening’s enter-
tainment, with the two main
actors deserving most of the
credit. It is to be hoped,
though, with “The World of
Susie Wong” well-established
and “The Flower Drum Song”
launched, that we shall be
spared a rash of plays about
the glamorous Orient.


THE LURE
OF THE
ISLANDS
by
R. S. PORTEOUS
< 1 np isten. Rusty,” I said,
“why don’t you slip
JLj down to the Gold
Coast for a few days?
Ring the Hotel Tradewinds
and book yourself a room.
You should see the place before
you go back. Sure to be one
or two old Island identities
staying there too. Sooner or
later everyone gravitates to the
Gold Coast.”
“What about you coming
with me?”
“No, thanks. I can’t spare
the time. You don't seem to
realise I've go* work to do.”
He looked at me with that
shrewd, quizzical grin I re-
membered so well: “You givin’
me the brush-off? Trying to
get rid of me?”
“Hell no, Rusty. You know
how pleased I am to see you
again after all these years. It's
just, as I said, that I must get
some work done.”
Rusty Martin was my friend.
Once, years ago, I had served
as mate on his schooner, trad-
ing and recruiting among the
Islands and along the New
Guinea coast. In those days
he had been one of the best-
known figures in the Islands, a
boisterous, colorful, generous
character, popular with every-
one except perhaps the long-
suffering wives of planters and
officials who wore threadbare
the excuse: “Rusty Martin’s in
port.”
The years had been kind
to Rusty. Certainly his once
sandy-red hair was now streak-
ed with grey, and the lines on
his ugly crag of a face were a
little deeper. But the man
himself was the same. Big,
robust and as boisterously
happy as ever, he seemed in-
destructible. His immense
capacity for drink hadn’t les-
sened, nor had his lust for
living; my own jaded feelings
after a week in his company
were proof enough of that.
A week ago, when Rusty
arrived at Brisbane airport, I
was delighted to see him. He
breezed into the crowded ter-
minal, bringing with him a
breath of the Islands. Maybe
it was only the memories he
evoked, but the broad
shoulders carelessly forcing
their way through the crowd,
the grin that lightened up the
weather-beaten face and the
untidy casualness of his attire
all seemed to drag the very
essence of the tropics into that
bustling terminal building.
I could see coconut-palms
curving gracefully out over the
water, their feathery green
fronds glittering in the hard
sunlight, could hear the gaily-
irresponsible chatter of native
voices above the crisp murmur
of surf on coral beaches, and
smell the rancid, smoky tang
of copra drying in the curing-
sheds.
“Well, you old long streak
of misery! It's good to see
you again.” Rusty's greeting
boomed through the building,
drowning out the amplified
voice announcing that flight
246 for Townsville and Cairns
was now ready for departure.
“And it’s good to see you
again, you blackbirding old
scoundrel,” I told him.
I was sincere, so sincere that
I bote his handclasp without
flinching and even forgot to
examine my hand for broken
bones when he released it.
We’d go to a quiet pub, have
a few beers and yarn over old
times.' There was so much I
wanted to hear about.
“How long are you stay-
ing?” I asked.
“Coupla weeks. Got some
business to fix up.” He looked
around, his roving glance
taking in the cafe, news-stand,
soft-drink stall and the uni-
formed girls behind the traffic
counter. “Don't they have a
bar in this joint? A man could
die of thirst, waiting for his
luggage to come ashore. Oh
well, I s[pose we'll live till we
get into town. You got a car
here?”
Yes, my car was waiting out-
side. I drove him to his hotel
and we had a few beers. In
fact we had more than a few.
|>Y the end of the week I felt
■ as if I had drunk enough
to fill the hold of a trading
schooner r the big trouble
being Rusty’s love of company.
Give him 10 minutes in a bar
and he’d have anything up to a
dozen drinkers in his party,
men he’d never seen before and
might never see again. Up in


the Islands his habit of shout-
ing for everyone in the bar did
no great harm because big
gatherings were rare and Rusty
seldom spent more than a day
or two in any port.
But in Brisbane’s bars it
could lead to no end of trouble.
Not that Rusty looked on it
as trouble. He enjoyed every
minute of those crowded
sessions and was of the opinion
that Brisbane men were as fine
a bunch of blokes as you’d
meet anywhere.
And they, in turn, enjoyed
his company. Listening to his
breezy, lusty yarns of the
Islands they forgot the mono-
tony of their city lives and
were carried away to adventure
in tropic seas. In their eyes
Rusty became a Bully Hayes;
I feel sure they pictured him
as a roistering buccaneer, fill-
ing the hold of his schooner
with fabulous .profits gained
over the sights of a gun.
Admittedly his stories were
highly-colored, but they were,
in the main, true.
He enthralled one audience
with a tale of mutiny on the
high seas. He had cleared the
mouth of the Sepik, he said,
and was heading for Salamaua
with a very profitable cargo of
Sepik River savages when the
trouble started. It was caused
by a missionary who had come
aboard at the last village and
humbly asked for a passage to
Salamaua.
Being naturally soft-hearted,
Rusty explained, he had
agreed to take the man, and the
missionary had repaid his
generosity by stirring up
trouble among the native cargo.
During the first night at sea
he had gone among them and
filled them up with tales about
the awful fate awaiting them,
and he had done it so con-
vincingly that in the morning
they loudly and truculently
demanded to be put ashore.
It was a nasty situation.
There were over 50 Sepiks
aboard, ugly customers all of
them, crudely tattooed with the
marks of the Sacred Crocodile
and only superficially converted
from cannibalism. Lulled by
gifts and promises they had
been docile enough until the
missionary intervened, but now
they were far from docile. In
fact they were showing signs
of reverting to the form that
had made them dreaded all
along the coast.
“Did you put them ashore?”
someone asked.
“Put ’em ashore! ” Rusty
scoffed. “Not on your bloody
life! That mob was worth
seven quid a head to me on
the beach at Salamaua. I had
buyers lined up waiting for
’em. Would you sit down and
watch four-hundred quid walk
off into the jungle?”
What did he do? Why, he
quietened ’em down, of course.
Let ’em see who was boss
aboard that schooner. He only
put one man ashore. He
marooned the trouble-making
missionary on a small island
and sailed into Salamaua with
his cargo intact.
It was a tall tale and it met
with a mixed reception. He
told it so well and so humor-
ously that most of his listeners
laughed loudly, '’adopting the
attitude that even if it was far-
fetched and improbable it was
a good yarn.
Only one man openly dis-
believed it. He was a well-
dressed, mild little man who
had come in for his usual
morning drink—one Scotch-
and-water before lunch. Al-
though he had refused to join
our party he stayed on the
fringes, listening.
“A highly improbable story,”
he declared primly. “Surely
you don’t expect intelligent
men to believe that that sort
of thing could take place these
days! Slave-trading, my dear
sir, was abolished long before
you were born.”
Vl7ith that quizzical grin
spreading over his face
Rusty said: “Improbable, is it?
Well, it happens to be true. If
you don’t believe me you can
ask this bloke.” He placed a
huge hand on my shoulder.
“He was my first mate at the
time.”
“Yes,” I admitted. “The
story is quite true.”
The little man put his empty
glass on the bar, distaste and
disapproval showing on his
face. “I still don’t believe it,”
he declared. “If I thought
there was an atom of truth in
it I’d write to the paper
and publicly denounce you,
whoever you are.”
And with that he walked out.
Later, during lunch, I said:
“You shouldn’t have pulled
that poor little bloke’s leg like
that, Rusty. You should have
explained things to him.”
“And spoil a good yarn!”
Rusty’s big shoulders shook
with laughter “I told the
truth, didn’t I? You can’t blame
me for what he thinks, can
you?”
Well, I suppose that was fair
enough. Rusty had told the
truth, but he had by no means
told all of it. Certain parts he
had left to his listeners’ imagi-
nation, and if they jumped to
fanciful conclusions that was
their affair. Possibly they pic-
tured Rusty quelling the mutiny
with a gun, and probably they
pictured the poor white mis-
sionary starving to death on a
desert island.
The little man had spoken
indignantly of slave-trading,
but Rusty could have en-
lightened him by explaining
that he was actually engaged
in recruiting native labor for
the goldfields and plantations.
It was a lawful trade, and
although he did actually receive
£7 a head for them the natives
presence of a government
official they signed contracts to
work for certain periods at
wages fixed by the government.
When his contract expired each
native was returned to his own
village, a man of importance
because of the riches he had
acquired.
And as for the missionary
—he was not a white man, nor
was he a good missionary. He
was a mission-trained native
who had been sent up to Sepik
to recruit labor for one of the
mission plantations. Evidently
deciding that Rusty had col-
lared all the available man-
power, he thought up a cunning
plan. If he could persuade the
natives aboard the schooner
that Rusty’s promises were
worthless he could go ashore
with them and recruit them
himself.
Rusty used neither force nor
firearms; didn’t even own a
gun. He used guile. He
anchored off the island, told
the mission boy that he had
another 20 recruits waiting
there to be picked-up, and said
he was willing to make a deal.
The two of them rowed ashore
to inspect the new recruits and
a little later Rusty came back
alone.
There was really nothing
more to it. They had walked
up to the only village on the
island, and while the mission
boy was talking to the luluai
Rusty slipped away. It was
then a simple matter for him
to convince the Sepiks that
they had been duped by a liar
who had deserted them at the
first opportunity.
“We’ll go back to that pub
at the same time tomorrow
morning,” Rusty suggested.
“And if the little bloke’s there
again we’ll tell him another,
eh?”
“You can count me out,” I
told him. “I’ll be busy to-
morrow.”
Having spent the whole week
trying to keep pace with him
I felt the need of a rest. He
was exhilarating but he was
also exhausting, and the pros-
pect of another week at this
pace appalled me. It was then
I got the inspiration about the
Gold Coast. He’d enjoy him-
self down there, and if he met
no other Island identities he’d
at least meet Luscious Laura.
At the thought of that meet-
ing I smiled.
Tn her way Luscious Laura
A had been as famous an
Island identity as Rusty.
She came to Rabaul as the
bride of a middle-aged planter
and she caused quite a sensa-
tion in the Island community.
She was tall, raven-haired and
seductively proportioned. Prob-
ably her looks would only have
excited passing admiration in
her native Melbourne, but up
in Rabaul, with its preponder-
ance of males, mainly lusty
bachelors, they caused a near
riot. Someone described her
as a “luscious bit of goods,”
and when it was learned that
her name was Laura the nick-
name became established.
The matrons of the town re-
served their decisions about the
latest addition to their ranks.
Certainly she spoke beautifully,
with a cultured accent fostered
by Melbourne’s most exclusive
girls’ school. She carried out
her social duties and, with a
regal air that matched her
accent, she staved-olf even the
most persistent of the bache-
lors.
But ... In the minds of the
matrons there was always that
“but.” Somehow Luscious
Laura always reminded them
of the volcano that smouldered
silently over Rabaul. Sooner
or later the volcano would
erupt. Would Laura? They
would wait and see.
They didn’t have to wait
long. Within a year Luscious
Laura revealed a contempt for
public opinion and a truly
amazing thirst. Moreover, she
could hold her liquor as well
as, or better than, the
hard-drinking bachelors who
plied her with it. Certainly,
under its influence, a new
Laura appeared; her beautiful
accent never slipped, never
varied, but her vocabulary
broadened considerably. She
said exactly what she thought
about Rabaul society, men
and women alike, and Luscious
Laura’s thoughts were not
always nice. She used words
that were never mentioned in
mixed company until she intro-
duced them, and she used them
with amazing fluency.
She set a pace that was too
fast for her husband. After
gallantly trailing the field for
five years the poor chap gave
up and died more or less peace-
fully in his sleep.
There were sighs of relief
after his funeral, the general

SIR GILBERT MURRAY WRITES OF
Murray of Yarralumla
To me in my childhood
my father was, with-
out question, the
greatest person in the
world. He was majestic to
look at, taller and stronger
than anyone I had ever seen,
very courtly and dignified in
speech, and, if I am not mis-
taken, generally clad in white
ducks. He was the ultimate
arbiter on all doubtful ques-
tions ; quite a “Victorian
father,” one may say, in style
and authority. I only remem-
ber one family rebellion, when
he decided that we ought to
call him “Sir,” whereas we
were accustomed to “Pups.”
The servants called him “Your
Honor,” in Irish fashion, or
else “Sir Terence.”
I remember a walk one
Sunday, when Hubert [after-
wards Sir Hubert Murray,
Administrator of Papua] and
I, running loose, happened to
disturb some pigs, and an old
boar chased us. We fled in
terror, shouting, “Run, Pups,
run! ” and were greatly
troubled because he went on
quietly walking with my
mother and not noticing us.
At last he said: “But, my little
fellow, don’t you see that it
would be ridiculous for me to
run away from a pig?” The
pig apparently agreed with him
and turned back.
My early remembrances are
of large houses and grounds
in the suburbs of Sydney,
especially one at Darling Point
and one at Rose Bay, but the
houses grew smaller and
smaller as my father grew
poorer—much as houses do
now for similar reasons. Of
course I never knew how it
happened, but droughts and
floods made a squatter’s life
always precarious, and after a
succession of bad years he
had had to sell all his land,
and at the end, I believe, had
only his salary as President of
the Legislative Council.
But in the good old days
he was a wealthy landowner
and kept open house, and
often free lodging also, for old
servants, passing travellers, dis-
tressed Irish gentlemen, and
the like. The census notes over
a hundred people living at
Yarrowlumla [sic] in March,
1841. Even in my time there
were two old men, ex-convicts,
in cottages, Old Tom and Old
Jimmy, quite past work, except
that Old Tom was expected to
prevent Old Jimmy from
throwing chairs and tables into
the fire, a fancy which some-
times came over him.
Then, of a very different
class, there was Mr. Dulhunty.
He was like an Irishman in
Thackeray, descended from
[An extract from “Gilbert Murray: An Unfinished
Autobiography” published this month by Allen and
Unwin, Ltd. A further extract, dealing with Murray’s
very lively schooldays at Moss Vale, N. S. Wales, will be
printed in next week’s “Bulletin.”
Sir Gilbert Murray, who was working on this auto-
biography at the time of his death in 1957, at the age of
91, was bom in Sydney in 1866. He was the brother of
Sir Hubert Murray, of Papua. Gilbert was sent to school
in London at the age of 11 and, Professor of Greek at
Glasgow at 23, became England’s most famous Greek
scholar, and is known to readers everywhere for his
translations of Greek drama.]
ancient kings, but in “tem-
porary financial embarrass-
ment.” Of course such poverty
was the normal —and indeed
the intentional—result of the
Penal Laws on the Catholic
gentry. Dulhunty had origin-
ally looked in for lunch, but
he stayed for some years and
then died. He had stately
manners, but must have been
an anxiety to my mother. He
had a natural contempt for
rich people of low birth and
manners, and was particularly
knowledgeable about the
descendants of convicts. On
one awful occasion some
eminent person who had come
to dinner said pleasantly, “I
think I saw you standing in
the drive, Mr. Dulhunty.”
“You did, sir,” was the reply.
“When a man’s carriage
splashes me with mud I always
stop and try to recollect what
his father was lagged for.” I
was removed from the room
at this point, and did not really
know that anything was wrong
till afterwards.
TVjlhunty used to refer to my
father as “The Emperor.”
One evening at the end of the
Franco-Prussian War of 1870,
when he came home from the
club slightly exhilarated, the
manservant who let him in
said: “Have you heard the
news? The Emperor has been
taken prisoner.” Dulhunty
burst into tears and collapsed
on the stairs in astonishment.
“Good God! What has he
done? We must save him.”
My father had originally
owned two fine stations:
v Yarrowlumla, where the
Federal capital, Canberra, now
stands, and Winderadene, near
Lake George. I think there
was another, too, which he
gave away, but of that I must
tell later.
There must have been a
succession of droughts and
floods. In one old letter I find
mention of 15,000 sheep lost
in floods ; and there was a
pretty constant anxiety about
the dry weather. Another
letter says that if the sheep
cannot be fed they can be
boiled. “Please boil - down
1000, or if you can, 2000.” In
a letter of November, 1843, he
does not see how he can escape
“this universal ruin,” and
there are at least two other
times of great anxiety.
'“There is also mention of mis-
management by agents, but
I suspect that he himself was
both over-generous and care-
less in money matters. My
mother told me how he had
once paid for a small piano
with a hundred-pound note
and noticed that the change
was, wrong. The shopman
answered insolently, “Well, Sir
Terence, that’s the first time
1 ever saw you count your
change.” He must, however,
have survived the “universal
ruin” of 1844, for I see that
the sale of his library took
place at Goulburn in 1865.
Winderadene was sold the next
year; Yarrowlumla, a very
fine place, had gone earlier.
The loss of the library was
a great grief to him. I once
saw a poem in his handwriting
of which I only remember the
opening:
An Murray grieves for Pope and
Swift
And many a comrade gone . . .
Nor can there have been a
good “seller’s market” for
libraries in Goulburn in 1865.
Though the chief local centre,
it was not a highly advanced
town. My Uncle William, on
driving in there, once found
the proprietor of the principal
inn engaged in fighting the
waiter in the yard: the case
being, “He’ll tell me he never
heered of Lea and Perrin’s
Worcestersheer sauce! ”
And the books themselves:
I have the auctioneer’s list
before me. There is a good
deal of history: Herodotus,
Josephus, Csesar, Tactitus,
Sallust, Grote, Thirlwall,
Gibbon, Hume and Smollett
in 13 volumes, Robertson in
12, Voltaire’s Empire de R'ussie
sous Pierre le Grand, and
Charles XU de Suede ; among
biographies there are Plutarch,
Campbell's Lives of the Chan-
cellors (10 volumes), lives of
Romilly, Canning, Peel, Dr.
Arnold, Carlyle’s Cromwell,
Boswell’s Johnson ; some 80
volumes on law and politics,
including Burke, Mill, Macin-
tosh, and books for the prac-
tical use of a magistrate ; an
abundance of theological
books, mostly Catholic, but
among them I notice not only
Plato (six volumes) and Aris-
totle’s Ethics, and the Koran,
but Essays and Reviews,
Froude’s Nemesis of Faith, and
even Comte’s Philosophic
Positive ; under Natural Philo-
sophy and the Physical Sciences
come a good deal of astronomy
and natural history, including
Darwin and Huxley ; there is
a quite surprising amount of
poetry, 151 volumes, reaching
down to Tennyson, Browning
and Clough, and eight very
large folio volumes of
“Ancient British Drama” and
“British Drama”; and some
32 books of practical medicine
and surgery. He well might
need them. It might be a long
ride to find the nearest quali-
fied M.Ch. or M.B. It was
certainly a remarkable library
for a man to have collected
in the eighteen-forties or ’fifties
in the remote bush. And
thereby hangs a tale.
My grandfather fought at
Waterloo and afterwards came
out to Sydney—or was it then
Botany Bay?—as Paymaster


to the forces there. When my
father was 20 or 21 he was
made a “Frontier Magistrate”
and given a grant of land in
the bush near Lake George
with a number of ticket-of-
feave convicts as servants. He
was determined not to let all
his education waste away. He
had an arrangement with some
friend in London or Dublin to
send out to him the most
interesting or important books
of the year. The packing-cases
took over three months on the
voyage ; the letters ordering
them had taken another three
months or more, and the last
hundred miles were by bullock-
wagon.
He found that these precious
books were being stolen and
sold in a pub in Goulburn for
a drink of spirits. He was
fairly sure which of the ser-
vants was the culprit, and one
day, when suddenly coming
into the room, he found the
man in the act. The convict
sprang at him and my father
with one great blow knocked
him senseless. For a moment
he was afraid the man might
be dead. “That was a great
lesson to me, my boy,” he
said in telling of the incident.
“I never struck them after that.
I always took them by the
throat.”
LJven the milder process, how-
ever, was not common.
He used often to tell us what
good people some of the
political convicts were. Old
Jimmy, for instance, had been
transported because, as a boy,
he had thrown up his hat at an
Irish fair where seditious
speeches were being„made. He
knew nothing about the
speeches, but he happened to
be on the outskirts of the
crowd and was easier for the
police to arrest. To go in and
get the ringleaders might have
led to a fight. “The Tol-
puddle Martyrs” had more
than enough parallels in Ire-
land. Indeed the Irish who
had been transported for poli-
tical reasons, though as indi-
viduals no doubt they had
their faults, formed a marked
aristocracy among the other
convicts.
In the early days of Yarrow-
lumla my father seems to
exercised an almost feudal
influence in the neighborhood.
A census taken in 1841 finds
108 people on the estate, com-
prising “eighty-seven Catholics,
seventeen Protestants, three
Presbyterians, and one Jew!”
(The Presbyterians, apparently,
were not content to be labelled
vaguely Protestant.) Besides
being a legal magistrate he
was also something of a
general adviser on the affairs
of life, like an Oriental kadi.
It is typical that when he was
invited by a deputation to
stand for Parliament he said
he was quite willing to repre-
sent them if they wished it, but
they must not expect him to
go round speaking and asking
for votes. So he stayed at
home while his supporters,
especially a great troop of
Irishmen, went round the
country electioneering. When
duly elected, as he always was,
he made two or three speeches
in the grand style, both on
local and on world-wide prob-
lems, such as he thought no
"Too flighty! An air-hostess should be down to earth!”
intelligent person should
neglect.
I mentioned that he gave
away one of his stations. I
do not know the details. As
I heard the story, he had a
Scotch, agent whom I will call
Mac Nab, who worked with
him hard and skilfully in some
time of drought or difficulty.
My father was so pleased with
Mac Nab that he said he was
more a partner than a servant,
and gave him the estate instead
of merely paying his salary.
Mac Nab took the land, and
then, in another time of
drought, when he, like other
squatters, was in desperate
need of ready money,
demanded his wages, too, with
arrears.
Of course I do not know the
rights of the matter, but it was
bitterly remembered. A great
many years afterwards my
eldest brother, Aubrey, was
one of a party of surveyors at
work in a lonely district of the
bush, when the news came that
a rich squatter about 70 miles
off was giving a party for his
daughter’s wedding and had
invited all who wished to
come. A number of the young
surveyors set-off riding to the
party. The station seemed
to be in country that my
brother knew ; and when they
had almost arrived he heard,
for the first time, that the
squatter's name was Mac Nab.
Aubrey had ridden a long way.
He was tired and hungry, but
honor was at stake. He made
some excuse for falling behind,
hobbled his horse in a grassy
place,-slept without food in
the bush and returned alone
to the camp.
In his political life, though,
as I have said, he would never
condescend to “asking for
votes,” my father was regu-
larly returned from 1842
onwards without interruption.
This is the more striking as he
was extremely independent and
frequently differed from the
Irish in Parliament, notably
on the question of sectarian
education. He had been deeply
impressed by the religious
strife which raged between
Catholic and Protestant in
Ireland and did his utmost to
prevent the seeds of it being
sown in a new country.
T>ut the Irish of the Murrum-
bidgee somehow felt that,
even if they did not quite under-
stand his views, his heart was
in the right place, and they
voted for him steadily and
without change. He always
kept up the Irish connection.
I have with me a copy of
Daniel O’Connell’s Ireland and
the Irish, presented to him by
the Liberator himself. He
entertained Gavan Duffy, and
was interested in the case of
Burke the Fenian, who was
sentenced to death but even-
tually pardoned in 1867.
In the “commonplace-
book” of his journal and
newspaper-cuttings which I
have before me there are many
reports of interesting legal
cases and curious crimes, and
several long and detailed
accounts of wrecks which
illustrate the extraordinary
helplessness of a ship at sea
in the days before wireless and
before steam.
One is surprised to find an
act of full-scale piracy on the
British ship Macduff on Octo-
ber 23, 1857, in lat. 7.20, long.
20.52, on its voyage round the
Cape to Melbourne. The pirates
attacked in three boats, 50 men
in each. It was mostly a fight
with muskets and cutlasses; the
ship had two 241 b. carronades,
but, being in a dead calm, could
not bring them to bear. At
last, by skilful manoeuvering,
she did so, and sank one of
the pirate boats, which finished
matters.
Almost more strange as a
mark of lawlessness is the story
of Mona Vale, a district on the
coast quite near to Sydney,
about a dozen miles north of
Manly Beach. A certain Mr.
Taylor in 1840 had bought a
farm there, built a house,
fenced the land and so on. His
wife being ill, he went to live
in Sydney and left the land
vacant for a while. At last he
let the farm to a tenant, who
arrived to find the house burnt
down and the fences destroyed.
Another tenant, however, took
the place; rebuilt the house and
went vigorously to work restor-
ing the whole farm. The
house was set fire to, his best
horse had its throat cut, his
son was found shot dead; at
last he himself was murdered.
So things continued. Two
families in the neighborhood
had determined that they would
not allow anyone to settle on
this land, which they had
arranged to share between
them.
For 15 years a sort of local
private war continued, houses
being burnt, cattle killed,
fences broken, and the tenants
driven away, without any
effective control by the law.
Not until the early ’sixties were
the chief criminals convicted.
T ife was certainly not smooth
- Ll ' nor by modern stand-
ards safe. As late as 1865, for
instance, I find several pages
of the commonplace-book filled
with accounts of the bush-
rangers who were then terrori-
sing the district near Lake
George and the Victorian
border. There was a famous
gang led by Gilbert (as I was
not allowed by my schoolmates

On the Expense Account
Moral indignation in the United
States over rigged TV quiz-
programmes and “payola” and
“plugola” handouts to disk-
jockeys has now been pushed into the
background by revelations of the extent
to which the expense-account racket has
grown in recent years.
There is, after all, a limit to the number
of $64,000 payouts on quiz-shows and
to the number of platter-spinners in a
position to rig popularity-polls of rock-
’n’-roll records to the mutual benefit of
themselves and the recording-companies.
Moreover, in these cases, although the
public may resent having its leg pulled
and its faith in its shadowy idols shat-
tered, there is no sense of direct
pecuniary loss.
Till recently the American man-in-the-
street was not really aware that the
expense-account system had any remote
connection with his pocket, either. Not
that he didn’t feel envious of his neigh-
bor who had the free use of the firm’s
car, the salesman who could order drinks
or a dinner and “charge it up to
expenses,” or of the executive whose
visits to other cities included as a matter
of course accommodation at the most
expensive hotels at no cost to himself.
But all these, and similar items, he was
inclined to regard as lucky breaks that
came to the men who were fortunate
enough to land the right jobs.
But the Yank-in-the-street is taking a
less-tolerant view of things since the U.S.
taxation-authorities pointed out that as
expense-account items are deducted from
the income of either the employer or
the employee the question of their
genuineness is a matter of national con-
cern—which means that it is the concern
of the ordinary taxpayer. It is claimed
that the system has been used to conceal
taxable income to the tune of about
$l5OO million a year and that the annual
tax-loss from this source is $7OO million.
In other words, the ordinary taxpayer
has to kick-in an extra $7OO million a
year to pay for faked expense-accounts.
Living on “Exes.”
Tn the last week of 1959 the U.S. Depart-
ment of Internal Revenue announced
that it intended to come down heavily
on offenders. That in itself was not an
original move. For a long time, and
particularly in the past two years, the
department has been trying to curb the
excesses of the system. It is not criticis-
ing the payment of reasonable expenses
actually incurred by an employee in the
course of his work and recouped by the
employer. The employee certainly should
not be taxed on such money, and it is
also right that it should’be an allowable
deduction on the employer’s return.
What the authorities are out to stop is
the practice of using the expense-account
to cover-up taxable income. In some
cases this merely amounts to petty tax-
dodging ; in others it involves men who
virtually live off their expense-account.
The “U.S. News and World Report,”
an independent weekly news-magazine
published in Washington, U.S.A., has
been looking into the expense-account
racket and -has published a small cata-
logue of some of the blatant and
ingenious lurks uncovered by the taxa-
tion-authorities in Washington.
All examples are from official files.
It was found, for example, that five
businessmen regularly lunched together
and took turn-and-turn-about to sign the
chit for the whole table. All were
including the expenditure in their tax-
returns as legitimate business-expenses.
The cost of entertaining a client at lunch
is a deductible expense, but the five men
were lunching on the taxpayer.
Cocktails and Yachts
A re cocktail-parties deductible ex-
penses? Provided it can be shown
that they are a necessary business-
expense reasonably expected to return a
business benefit they may be. But U.S.
tax-agents investigated the social engage-
ments of a doctor and his wife who gave
frequent and lavish cocktail-parties and
included the costs among their deductions.
It was found that most of the guests
were friends and neighbors, with two
or three other medicos to complete the
list. The justification advanced for the
claim was that the parties “were to build
professional goodwill.” It is now ruled
that guest-lists must be kept and the
deduction, limited to the costs of enter-
taining business-guests only.
In another case a man and his wife,
sole partners in a business, claimed as
deductions the cost of maintaining two
yachts and two planes allegedly used for
“ordinary and necessary” travel.
Investigators concluded that all four
craft were used mostly for personal
pleasure ; they assessed the tax-deficiency
at $lBO,OOO.
Another couple, working on not quite
so lavish a scale, claimed for the main-
tenance of one yacht. The revenue-man
queried the amount, saying that it seemed
rather a lot “for weekends and a few
evenings of entertaining,” whereupon
the wife protested, “It's not just a matter
of weekends and evenings. We prac-
tically live on it.”
It was, in fact, their summer home.
The verdict was that they could live on
the yacht if they pleased, but they
couldn’t expect the taxpayers to sub-
sidise it. It is to be hoped the Common-
wealth Commissioner of Taxation keeps
his eye on the returns of Australian
yacht-dwellers.
Holidays on the Cheap
'Dusiness-conventions are apparently
a rich field for those who play the
expense-account game. The “U.S. News
and World Report” cites the case of an
enterprising gentleman who stretched a
three-day convention into a fortnight’s
holiday with all expenses paid. Appar-
ently his company didn’t buck, but the
tax-men did. Also the case of the
unconventional fellow who took his wife
to the convention and claimed for her
expenses as well as his own. Most con-
ventioners probably approved the official
decision that knocked him back.
“Use of car” is one of the most
common perks that is equivalent to tax-
free incomes, here as well as in the U.S. ;
so is the complementary arrangement
whereby a company pays the running-
costs of an executive's car. But the tax-
director in Washington must have swal-
lowed his cigar when he checked one
such claim and found out that the car
claimed on was actually being used by
the man’s son, at college 1000 miles away.
Even though a mink-coat is regarded
as a “must” in certain circles, the U.S.
Treasury still retains the old-fashioned
idea that clothes are an item of personal
expenditure. It knocked-back the claim
of an advertising-man that his wife’s
mink was deductible because she had
to look her best for customers.
A dim view was also taken of the
tycoon who felt that the $BOOO he spent
on his daughter's debut was a legitimate
business expense, an idea also held by
another businessman concerning the
$6500 his daughter’s wedding cost him.
Living in Style
As an indication of the more flagrant
use of the “swindle-sheet” an example
is cited of the president of a “closely-held
corporation” (presumably the equivalent
of a private company in Australia) whose
salary is $25,000 a year, but who, by
the time the company has paid the rent
of his expensive city apartment, his car-
allowance, club-dues, various convention-
expenses, trips abroad and the cost of
gifts to customers and personal friends,
is actually living on the scale of a far
greater income. To enjoy the same style
on a fully-taxed income he would need
a pay-envelope of $98,000 a year, from
which taxes would take $62,600.
As it is, the tax-man gets $B3OO on
the man’s stated income and the com-
pany claims all the extras as deductible
expenses. Some of the extras are legiti-
mate expenses ; others are obviously paid
in lieu of salary and should be taxable.
The U.S. Revenue Department is now
insisting on far more detailed account-
ing of items of this sort. The tax-return
includes questions about deductions
claimed for hunting-lodges, working-
ranches, fishing-camps; the use by
officers, employees or customers of
dwellings, apartments or hotel-suites ;
attendance of relations at conventions ;
vacations for employees and their
families ; use of yachts, etc.
Close attention will still be given to
personal returns, but the new move is
an attempt to attack the problem nearer
the source. Will it succeed? Probably
to only a limited extent. But even if it
only makes the expense-account boys a
little less flamboyant in their spending it
will do a good social service.


SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Form at Rosehill
Australia’s best two-year-old,
Sky High now has the record
of being unbeaten in his five
starts, with his best cash win
the S.T.C.’s Golden Slipper
Stakes at Rosehill last Satur-
day. Sky High’s success netted
£6265 (of the £lO,OOO stake)
for owner-breeder Brian Crow-
ley and brought the colt’s earn-
ings to £9060. He now goes on
to the A.J.C. Sires’ Produce
Stakes and the Champagne
Stakes, and form points to a
continuance of his fine record.
Rounding the home-turn in the
Slipper, he swung wide, but he’s
a strongly-built colt, and ridden
hard by A. Mulley he defeated
the present best filly, Wenona
Girl, and Melbourne’s best filly,
Impulsive, who came from the
rear of the field. Sky High’s
brother, Skyline, won the
Golden Slipper in 1958, also
ridden by Mulley. Last season
Fine And Dandy was success-
ful while Todman in 1957 won
the first of the series. Thus all
four winners of the Slippers
run to date have been sons of
Star Kingdom (imp.), which
puts deserved emphasis on the
quality of N.S.W. breeding
from that English sire. Not
only owners shared in the prize-
money: the trainers were also
in it, Jack Green (Skyline)
getting £500; M. McCarten
(Wenona Girl), £200; T. Wood-
cock (Impulsive), £lOO. There
was also a cyt of £250 for
fourth, a nice bit of feed for
Gemini Prince.
Jockey J. Thompson has
now landed the S.T.C.’s £3OOO
Cup four times in 13 years, the
last three in succession. He
won on Columnist in 1948, on
Monte Carlo in 1958, on
Valerius last year, and again on
Valerius last Saturday. Rand-
wick trainer Frank Dalton
prepared Monte Carlo (now in
America), and Valerius is a
member of his present team of
consistent winners. Valerius
could be hard to beat in the
A.J.C.’s Centenary Invitation
Stakes; his Rosehill perform-
ance, with top weight of 9.1,
was first-class. Dare Say’s
third on Saturday was an im-
pressive run from the rear of
the field.
• • • •
Odds-on favorite Noholme,
ridden by N. Sellwood, was
pocketed at a vital stage of
the w.-f.-a, Rawson Stakes at
Rosehill, and Bardshah
defeated the pacemaker, New
Zealander Froth, by a head,
with the hot-pop three-
quarters of a length away
third. Though it looked as
if Noholme should have won,
Bardshah ran a very promis-
ing trial for the Invitation
Stakes, particularly as he’s
first-rate over a mile-and-a-
half distance. He has won
nine races all told, including
the A.J.C. St. Leger, since his
owner - breeder rejected a
modest offer for him as a
yearling.

11 races at from five to 12
furlongs, including the Colin
“We're lucky to live in this mechanised age—horses
used to actually WORK!”
Stephen Stakes and the Craven
Plate (twice), as well as. other
w.-f.-a. events —hasn’t scored
for about 17 months, but he
now seems fighting fit. Though
unplaced in Saturday’s Rose-
hill Welter he wasn’t far away,
and shaped well enough to jot
down for an early win. A
few days earlier he and Mac-
dougal figured in an exception-
ally fast seven-furlongs trial at
Rosebery. Macdougal’s fourth
in the Rawson Stakes was also
quite a good effort, as he
came from last in the early
stages and was still a long way
back on the home-turn. This
fine stayer has 9.5 in the
Sydney Cup, and horses enjoy-
ing a pull in weight will need
to be good stickers to lower
his colors. Last year Mac-
dougal won the two-miles
Brisbane Cup with 7.11, the
13-furlongs Metropolitan with
8.6, and the Melbourne Cup
with 8.11. Three unplaced
outings since the Melbourne
Cup have benefited him.
Trained by Dick Roden, and
now a six-year-old, he’s very
close to a return to best form.
This page suggests it should
pay dividends to follow both
Macdougal and Prince Darius.
One of the easiest wins at
Rosehill was four-year-old
Empress Fay’s in the event
for fillies and mares. Consis-
tency itself, she has now won
five races, and on Saturday
was a class well above the
rest.
Further light on the Don-
caster and Sydney Cup should
come from the seven-furlongs
Liverpool Handicap and 10-
furlongs Autumn Handicap at
Warwick Farm on Saturday—
curtain-raiser to the Randwick
Centenary Carnival. Even more
attractive at this Farm meet-
ing could be the 10-furlongs
Chipping Norton Stakes run at
w.f.a. Tulloch was among the
17 nominated, and if they
accepted with him he’d cer-
tainly fill the stands. He won
the race two years ago, and of
course would be the pick of
this year’s 17 entrants.
• • • •:
Imported Fuss easily won the
Liverpool Handicap last season,
from Grenoble and Boorala,
and Foxmara was too solid
for Baystone and On Line in
the Autumn Handicap. Fuss
was then made second-favorite
for the Doncaster, but ran a
poor race, well behind Tudor
Hill, from Melbourne, who
easily beat On Guard and Book
Link. The Sydney Cup went
to On Line, from Foxmara
and Bardshah, so the Warwick

Along with a vast amount of
engaging information, it gives
a most readable history of the
course, first set aside as a race-
track in 1833 as a Govern-

At Caulfield
After the feast of sport
Victorian racegoers have
enjoyed over the past few
weeks it was rather a come-
down to find that the first
three events at Caulfield on
Saturday were divisions of a
Maiden Two-year-old. They
were set-weight events, and,
as usual with races for two-
year-olds, the winners were
not hard to pick. Of the 57
that ran in the three heats,
the most impressive was
Myzami, who won the third
division easing-up by five
lengths, to record 1.5| for the
5| furlongs. He’s a bay colt
by Trizami from Valley View.
Wallingford, though having his
first start, was preferred in the
betting; his supporters will
get their money back before
long. A chestnut gelding
by Chavey Down from the
“crooked - leg” mare True
Course (who won £14,000 in
her two-year-old year), Wal-
lingford needs more ground
than the 5| furlongs of Satur-
day’s race.
• • • •
Merabilly won the first
division as easily as the
betting suggested he should —
he was 6 to 4 on, the next best-
at 12 to 1. He had started
only once before, for a second
to Fred Astaire’s good filly
Far Out. A brown gelding
“Hi, boay! Wha’s this place ?”
by the new sire Rashleigh,
he’s from Yungawee by
Empyrean from Portskerrie.
Yungawee was an exception-
ally good two-year-old; she
defeated Cromis and Love To
All in the Ascot Vale Stakes.
Th e r e’s a cosmopolitan
background to Sweet Wendy,
winner of the second division.
Owned by R. Falkiner, she’s
raced on lease by St. Kilda
coffee-lounge proprietor G.
Taranto, who came here from
Sicily, and P. Chressos, who
came from Turkey. Neither
of them had raced a horse
before. Sweet Wendy is by
Sweet William from Stygian
by Solar Bear from Schwart
by Drake. There’s staying
blood in her veins, and the
determined way she finished
suggested that she will be at
home in the longer races for
her sex next spring.
Last year’s Melbourne Cup
favorite, Mac, came right back
to his best form to win the
.12-furlongs Glenhuntly Handi-
cap. Although he had a good
horse’s weight in 9.4, he was
always going easily, and ran
home a very comfortable
winner. There are not many
good-class successes in Mac’s
record, but he really is a top-
notch staying handicapper.
If he should get a run in the
Sydney Cup Mac will be a
good rival for fellow-Victorian
Nilarco.
Caulfield certainly must be
the fastest track in Australia.
Four times in recent weeks
a new Australian record for
furlongs has been set at
“the Heath,” and none of the
record-breakers is in the first-
flight of Australian sprinters.
In January Royal Artist and
Small Time set new figures in
divisions of the Barton Handi-
cap ; then Power Duke cut
the time to 1.3 f in the Oak-
leigh Plate. On Saturday
Proponder won the Caulfield
Sprint in the almost incredible
time of 1.2 f. It seems all
astray that a six-year-old
gelding like Proponder, whose
record is very ordinary, and
who, moreover, races with a
bowed tendon, should hold
Australian time-honors. Still,
there have been others of his
class with Australian records
to their names.

One Caulfield performance
to remember was Smogol’s'
withering finish to win the
seven-furlongs Orrong Two-
year-old. Three from home
the colt was nearly last in the
big field. Young Lyle Har-
bridge, who rides so strongly,
wove a path through the field,
and over the last furlong
brought his mount down the
outside to win easily. Owner-
breeder A. Thorp has Derby
ambitions for Smogol. He’s
by Smokey Eyes from Miss
Golea (who died recently, but
who produced good winners
in Philstar, Golbury, Smoke-
lea *and Lady Djafar). Trainer
Norm Hennington shares
Thorpe’s good opinion of
Smogol.
For all that its detractors
say to the contrary, racing is
a nine-tenths-honest sport,
and most course-demonstra-
tions are inspired by- nothing
more than a wounded pocket.
At Caulfield the crowd gave
Orinoco an unpleasant recep-
tion as he came back to scale
after winning the Neerim
Handicap (10 furlongs ; three-
year-olds). Reason was that
he had been heavily supported
in each of his two previous
runs, but had raced disappoint-
ingly. On Saturday he was
a drifting 7 to 1. As trainer
Alf Sands said feelingly, “I
wish this hooting mob had
seen the pocketful of tickets
1 had for Orinoco at Fleming-
ton!” In any case, Orinoco
should never have won the
race. Fair Scout was buffeted

Most interesting win at last
Friday night’s Harold Park
meeting was the success of a
much-reformed barrier-rogue,
Bablacombe Bay, in the Three-
year-old Stakes. Getting away
smartly this time, the Carrison
Hanover colt soon took the lead
and raced on to a comfort-
able win, running the 11| fur-
longs in lysec. faster time than
Selwyn’s 1951 record. Trained
and driven by Merv Adams,
who took the colt over when
Jack Binskin fractured a knee
several weeks back, Babla-
combe Bay will now be set for
the N.S.W. Pacers’ Derby, to
be run early in May.

Other Sports
“Ailsey”: Jack Low, New-
castle (N.S.W.) bowler, has
enough lowdown on bagging
titles to crack a jackpot. When
he was with the Lithgow club
he won the N.S.W. Country
Week singles championship
three times < and for as many
years held the club’s singles
title also. At Newcastle he
has won seven club titles, three
district singles and a fours.
Back in 1938 he represented
Australia in the Empire Games
and was runner-up in the
Australian singles, and now,
at 72, he has won Newcastle
City Club’s Master’s Singles
championship. He learnt his
bowls in Scotland, and has

“Briars”: Now that the foot-
ball-season is almost upon us,
it might be well for some of
the Sydney women writers to
realise that Rugby Union really
is played in Melbourne. One
woman columnist mentioned
a male colleague, who, she
avers, thinks there is no other
football but Rugby Union.
“Wouldn’t it be awful,” she
wrote, “if he had to go and
live in Melbourne.” Her male
colleague would have the time
of his life in Melbourne--
especially at our house, where
Rugby Union is even more
than the main topic of conver-
sation . . . it’s a way of life.
My father-in-law is a life-
member of the V.R.U.; my
husband is a vice-president of
it, and also a vice-president of
the Harlequin Club; and my
son is a club captain and a
State player . . . you see what
I mean. To emphasise that
Rugby Union is played in
Melbourne (it is now played
in high- and public-schools) it
might be mentioned that in the
last game played here between
N.S.W. and Victoria . . . Vic-
toria won!

“Recorder”: Soccer Federa-
tion, now four years old, has
decided to follow the English
competitive system —so when
the season ends the three teams
at the bottom of the first divi-
sion will be relegated to second
division. It could mean a
decidedly warm, not to say
hot, competition, with partisan-
ship in the clubs at a pretty
high temperature to begin
with. Federation officials hope
to control unruliness by spec-
tators, but don’t give them-
selves much chance of success.

“Rugger”: One for Ripley?
Believe it or not, there are
more Rugby Union teams in
America than there are in
either Scotland or Ireland!
It’s a fairish slab of country,
but few would thus link it with
Union. Tom McCormac,
president of the Australian
R.U., on his way recently to
the International Rugby Con-
ference in England found the
set-up in the U.S. as reported,
was himself impressed, and
got in some Union p.-r. work
which impressed the Yanks.

“Tom”: Another Dave
Brown may become a Sydney
Rugby League star. The new
Dave is a 19-year-old, ex-
Newcastle player signed-on by
St. George. In trial games he
has shown speed, ability to
back-up and the footwork to
penetrate the defence. A solid
tackier, he would have been
immediately chosen in first-
grade in most Sydney clubs.
Like his noted namesake, he’s
a centre-threequarter and
skilful goalkicker.

“Lyle”: With the right
brand of name for a red-
headed, 16st., 6ft. 4in. Irish-
man, Michael Spillane, from
Limerick, looks like starring
this year in Sydney’s Rugby
Union. He played for Munster
against the 1958-59 Wallaby
side, and already has been
heartening Drummoyne fol-
lowers with some fine foot-
ball. Drummoyne has also
secured recently-arrived Welsh
player David Bryan, a 15st.
forward, but an armistice is
reported to have been arranged
for the duration of the season.
“Hipilo”: There wouldn’t
be half-a-dozen people in
Australia who know the
literally inside reason why
Betty Cuthbert lost the
women’s 100yds. champion-
ship of Australia to Pat
Duggan, th e Queensland
“rocket.” Miss Cuthbert
changed her diet on the morn-
ing of the race, and ate a bowl
of rice! Beaten, she diced
rice, and two days later ran
a world record in winning the
220yds. championship.

“Tennisite”: Though the
Davis Cup Challenge Round,
to be played in Sydney, won’t
come off till December the
N.S.W. Lawn Tennis Associa-
tion, doing the organising for
the Australian body, has
already appointed its commit-
tees, and is now look-
ing into the accommoda-
tion side of it and the
Midas roll sure to be forth-
coming. It’s been decided to
prepare about 18,000-20,000
seats more if demand
warrants. Nobody doubts that
it will again draw maybe
stronger than ever.

“Lai”: Victorian cyclists
John Young and John Green
proved too good for Swiss star
Oscar Plattner and Peter Pan-
ton in the £lO,OOO Milk Six at
Melbourne Velodrome. Both
teams finished equal on laps
covered, but Green and Young
clinched first-prize with a
sprint-points total 778 to 638.
Dick Ploog and Barry Waddell
came in third, three laps behind
the winners. It was a great
victory for Green and Young
because of the hectic last-
minute bid by Plattner and
Panton. All in all the riders
covered 8963 laps, which
worked out at 1400 F miles.

“Bob Ray": Former Queens-
land all-rounder, unlucky not
to have played more Test
cricket than he did, Len
Johnson is still playing the
game with great zest in his
home-town of Ipswich. His
team, Booval, won the premier-
ship, and in the vital final
match of the season Len duly
played his all-round part, tak-
ing 4 for 15 (including a hat-
trick), and scoring 48 runs in
42 minutes. There’s another
all-rounder Johnson coming
on, too —14-year-old school-
boy son Ken. In one match
recently Ken took 9 for 17 with
his medium pacers, and he has
notched as high as 175 not-out
in school cricket.

“Stumped”: West Indies
cricket authorities aren’t keen
on next year’s tour of Aus-
tralia opening in the eastern
States against strong represen-
tative teams. They want to
open in Westralia and work
into form as the team moves
eastward. The team will come
to Australia in two groups.
The professionals, who mostly
earn their living playing in
England’s Lancashire League,
will travel by steamer from

fly from the West Indies.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
GERMANY: AUY OR NOT?
Reports that West Germany
wanted the use of military-
training and nuclear-testing
facilities in Britain, following
hard upon the row over Ger-
man supply-bases in Spain,
brought from the British press
another of those periodical
“agonising reappraisals” of
Britain’s relations with West
Germany.
Representative of the more
extreme reaction to the news
is William Barkley, in London
“Daily Express”:
“The whole idea of arming
the Germans only 15 years
after just disarming them has
been muffed by Parliament. It
runs counter to every British
instinct.
“Even the more horrible
question of arming them with
nucl e ar weapons is being
slipped through while Labor
members explode among one
another with their petty ven-
dettas, and Tories muzzle
themselves out of a sense of
good public-relations with their
Government.
“The training of German
airmen in Britain, mostly in
Scotland, was adopted without
ever facing the bald challenge
of public opinion.
“It is fantastic that we should
be expected to settle-down into
a cosy alliance with the Ger-
mans before we see any fruit
of repentance in them for
having twice ravished and im-
poverished Europe and us.
“We are told now by cor-
respondents in Germany that
popular opposition here
[Britain] to German expansion
hurts them. Up till now they
were overwhelmingly friendly
to the British, we are assured,
but they are forced to have
second thoughts.
“It seems impossible to get
into their arrogant heads that
we regard them as criminals in
the dock and that what matters
is whether we choose to be
friendly with them.”
London “Daily Mail,” how-
ever, while admitting editori-
ally that “Germany is not loved
in this country [Britain], nor
can she expect to be,” holds
that “this matter is too momen-
tous to be influenced by
emotion. We should try to
look at it realistically”:
“Germany has been a mem-
ber of the Atlantic Alliance
since 1954. The decision to
admit her was made in 1951 by
the Labor Government, who
also developed the atom-bomb
and permitted American bases
to be established here.
“These decisions form part
of a coherent defence-pattern.
An essential part of it is a re-
armed Germany.
“It was agreed that the
German Army should be of 12
divisions. Today there are 11
divisions—and the alarm goes
up that Germany will soon be
London “Daily Express.”
“CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE FUSS! OUR MANNERS
ARE IMPROVING. AFTER ALL, LAST TIME WE
TESTED THEM WITHOUT ASKING PERMISSION”
the strongest land Power in
Europe. That was known, too.
“Germany is also to have
sea- and air-forces, the latter to
consist of fighter-aircraft but
no heavy bombers. She will
also have the use of nuclear
weapons under American con-
trol.
“That is the picture of Ger-
many Rearmed, 1960. But
remember that we and our
friends created it. It is no use
screaming blue murder because
we are doing what we set out
to do. We have to face the
implications of our own
policies or run away from
them.
“One of these implications is
the need for training-facilities
and supply-bases for the
German forces. Both are
demanded by Nato and, if that
organisation is to be efficient,
they cannot be denied.”
Arguing along similar lines
in London “Daily Telegraph,”
Jo Grimond, leader of the
British Liberal party, adds that
“the Central European frontier
of Nato is in Germany. West
Germany varies from about 80
to about 220 miles in depth.
She is in the front-line with
very little elbow-room. She
did not particularly want to be
armed. But since accepted
in Nato she has been a staunch
ally—something not to be
despised these days.”
But, London “Observer”
argues editorially, there is “an
important difference” between
West Germany and Britain’s
other Nato allies:
“Because of the continued
division of Germany and the
special position of Berlin, Ger-
many is a bone of contention
between Russia and the West.
Until these problems are solved,
it is reasonable to ask Germany
voluntarily to accept certain
limitations not imposed on
other countries.
“This is also in Germany’s
own interests. It is quite un-
true, for instance, that if West
Germany had her own nuclear
weapons (as Herr Strauss once
said), they would make it easier
for her to achieve German re-
unification. They would make
it much more difficult.
“The truth is, as Mr. Denis
Healey, M.P., argues in a
Fabian pamphlet, The Race
Against the H-Bomb, that a
local arms-race in Central
Europe, superimposed upon the
existing arms-race between
Russia and the United States,
would make the present
‘balance of terror’ even more
precarious.
“To suggest various kinds of
arrns-limitation in Central
Europe is not to be anti-
German or even anti-Nato. In
Mr. Healey’s words, ‘an agree-
ment with Russia on some
form of arms-limitation and
control on both sides of the
Iron Curtain may soon be seen,
not as an alternative to Nato
but as a condition of Nato's
survival.’
“West Germany must be
given the bases she needs to
fulfil her role as part of the
shield-force (though Spain is
certainly not the place for
them). She should not be
given nuclear weapons that
directly threaten Poland and
Russia. If this is discrimina-
tion against Germany, it is a
kind of discrimination which
many of Germany’s allies
would be glad to accept.”
Views on the U.S.
■p DiroRiALLY reviewing a book
' called As Others See Us
(Oxford University Press) —“a
symposium of essays on the
U.S. written by a galaxy of
distinguished contributors from
most of the countries outside
the Soviet bloc”— the Man-
chester “Guardian” draws
“from between its lines” two
conclusions, “one of them
encouraging, the other not”:
“First, the United States is
hated as cordially by the
extreme Right as by the
extreme Left; and it is most
popular with moderates. This
seems to be true of Canada as
of Spain, of Britain as of
France. Second, where
America is most unpopular, it
is because of her culture more
than her policies.
“Most of the contributors
to,this symposium are friendly
towards the American way of
life. Some of them, such as
Professor Brogan, of this coun-
try [U.K.] or Dr. Eisenstadt, of
Israel, show as sensitive an
appreciation of it as most
Americans do. Even so, the
reader cannot help seeing that
in most countries intellectuals
have watched the encroach-
ments of American culture
with shudders of disgust, if
not outright hostility.

This year marks the centenary of exploration
in the Northern Territory. It is to be duly
celebrated by Territorians, and good Australians
everywhere will unite in spirit with them in honor
of the occasion.
The centenary is one more reminder of
Australia’s youth as a nation. Barely a hundred
years have passed since John McDouall Stuart was
exploring the area that now bestrides the Australian
map to the extent of more than half a million
square miles.
For years this vastness went virtually
unclaimed. South Australia annexed it from New
South Wales in 1863. It passed in transfer to the
Commonwealth Government in 1911.
The years have brought to it their slow but
certain change. The landscape is largely as Stuart
saw it in 1860. But now in wide watered pockets
at Alice Springs, along the Victoria River, and
on the Barkly Tableland, most of the Territory’s
fine herds of beef-cattle are run.
Uranium, gold, mica and other minerals are
mined. The agricultural worth of the Territory’s
better soil, notably in rice-growing, is starting to
be realised.
In an- aerial age Darwin has grown from an
outpost to a worthy international gateway.
Administratively the Territory comes to maturity,
and has strong claims to future Statehood.
With all of this, there is still much awaiting
bestowal and achievement before the Territory can
come up to its rightful—and inseparable—place in
North Australian development.
The imminent building of a network of roads
to carry cattle by road-trains through Western
Queensland will give extra outlets to raise the
Territory’s beef production. Bauxite and other
major mineral deposits occurring in North
Queensland are known to spill over within
its borders.
Richer days are ahead for the Northern
Territory. And, using the implements and resources
of our time, with bold imagination we could do
more for its productive opening in the next five to
ten years than has been possible from out of the
patient pioneering of a whole century.

“To sensitive souls on this

as that of any European coun-
try ; and what the European
often means when he attacks
the United States as an intel-
lectual desert is that Americans
do not put the professional
intellectual on a pedestal. But
that is because the United
States is a social democracy:
its pedestals are reserved for
democratic heroes. It is why
the ‘American way of life’ is
so insidious. As many contri-
butors to the symposium point
out, it is not particularly
‘American’ any longer: it is
the 20th-century way of life,
in its most extreme form.
“ ‘Three decades ago,’ Pro-
fessor Brogan writes, ‘M.
Andre Siegfried said the world
would have to choose between
Gandhi and Ford. Today it
has to choose between a more-
civilised and a less-civilised
version of the world of Henry
Ford, between Washington and
Moscow.’
“Perhaps the saddest contri-
butions in this book are those
from Egypt and India. The
Indian contributor, Mr. Gor-
wala, is fervently pro-Ameri-
can. But he reminds us that,
for many of his countrymen,
the United States has now
taken Britain's place as the
arch-imperialist of the West.
The same conclusion emerges
from the more hostile account
of Professor Mohammed
Khalafallah, of Egypt.
“If there is one overriding
conclusion from the book it
is that Jefferson and Lincoln
are still powerful symbols in
the uncommitted world —but
they are losing some of their
potency.”
Arab Viewpoint
V*7riting from Beirut to Lon-
* * don “Spectator” about
the Middle East situation—
which, the editors of that paper
say, “is more uncertain and
dangerous today than at any
time since Suez” —Michael
Adams notes that “when you
discuss the Palestine question
with Arabs (and I shudder to
think how many hours I have
spent in such discussions over
the past four years), they will
sometimes illustrate it this
way:
“What if Hitler, they will
say, instead of massacring the
Jews, had won the war in 1940
and established the State of
Israel in Cornwall And what
if the Americans, benevolently
neutral between Britain and
Israel, had given the Jews the
financial support they needed
to maintain their State against
your [Britain’s] obvious hos-
tility and your" ambition to
regain the lost part of your
homeland? And what if the
original settlement establish-
ing the State of Israel had
provided for a demilitarised
zone along the border between
Devon and what had been
Cornwall and was now Israel, a
zone in which, by the terms of.
the treaty, the English farmers
living there were to be allowed
to remain in possession of their
lands, and if, in defiance of
this treaty, the Israelis in Corn-
wall had gradually edged for-
ward and expelled them, blow-
ing-Up their villages and shoot-
ing at them as they tried to
plough their lands? Would
you then be so insistent on the
right of the Israelis to enjoy
free passage through the Suez
Canal?
“It is easy to dismiss this as
as absurd flight of fancy—but
again, unless we can exercise
our imaginations enough to
put ourselves in the place of
the Arabs, with all their weak-
ness and with hundreds of years
of foreign domination behind
them, how can we sit in judg-
ment on their present attitude
towards Israel?
“No detached observer can
deny that in agreeing to the
establishment of the State of
Israel on Arab lands, the world
did the Arabs an injustice —
and for the Arabs there is no
consolation in the fact that an
earlier injustice had been done
to the Jews, for it was not the
Arabs who persecuted the Jews
and sent them to the gas-
chambers. Why should they
and they alone be made to
atone for the sins of the world?
“Such an exercise of the
imagination can do nothing to
alter the facts of the situation;
but it can help us to under-
stand the intransigence of the
Arabs —and if the Arabs felt
that their attitude was under-
stood in the West, or even
approached with any sympa-
thetic will to understand, at
least the edge of their bitter-
ness would be dulled.
“As it is, they feel driven
back on their own inadequate
resources, both physical and
moral, resources which are the


more inadequate because the
Arab Governments are divided
by personal and dynastic and
material interests. If they
could agree with each other,
the problem would still be an
immensely difficult one; while
they are divided, no solution
is possible.”
Nuclear China—
When?
A recent rumor in India that
China was preparing to
test an atomic bomb, though
quickly denied, led Anthony
Manchester “Guardian:”
“JUST A LOT OF HOT AIR.”
Smith and Roderick MacFar-
quhar to consider, in London
“Daily Tele g r a p h,” the
“extremely sparse” facts avail-
able about Chinese nuclear
research.
“We know that the Russians
have built a heavy-water
reactor in Peking for research.
This started operation in
June, 1958, and has a capacity
of 7000-10,000 kilowatts ; it is
comparable in size with some
of the experimental reactors
built at Harwell.
“Such a reactor could pro-
duce about 71b. of plutonium
a year after a year’s delay.
Theoretically one needs only
101 b. for an atomic bomb ; in
practice one would be unlikely
to start on making a bomb
with less than 151 b.
“So it is theoretically pos-
sible for the Chinese to have
a bomb by the end of this
year, but the more likely
earliest date is the end of 1961.
Even the latter date pre-
supposes, however, that the
Chinese are so determined to
explode their bomb that they
will cut all corners.
“They would be diverting all
their plutonium to bombs and
keeping none for research.
This is certainly a possibility
from the political angle.
“But the sounder and
accepted method of develop-
ment would be for the
Chinese to build another re-
actor, larger and different to
the present one and use the
plutonium from that for mak-
ing nuclear weapons. In
Britain this step—from the
start of Harwell to the starting-
up of the large plutonium-
producing reactors at Wind-
scale—took four years.
“If one cuts a year off this
time to allow for the increased
amount of published data and
the all-out efforts the Chinese
are probably making, such an
approach would mean a
Chinese bomb by about the
middle of 1962. After that,
with the larger reactor, the
Chinese could hope to pro-
duce seven or eight a year.
“All this assumes —in order
that we should not be sur-
prised by the swiftness with
which China gets to the stage
of exploding a ‘nuclear
device’—that Peking will have
no technical difficulties with
the handling of plutonium.
Since this is a man-made
metal, Chinese scientists will
have had no experience in
handling it until their reactor
starts production unless they
have had Russian training.
“It also assumes that short-
age of trained personnel and
the absence of the widespread
scientific knowledge accumu-
lated in advanced industrial
countries will not be limiting
factors. If one does make
allowance for these considera-
tions, 1963-64 is the earliest
likely date for a Chinese
nuclear explosion.
“This analysis is based on
published Chinese data. If
Russia has given China secret
aid, clearly the argument falls
down. One American maga-
zine, quoting Hong Kong
‘intelligence experts,’ has stated
that there is a second Chinese
reactor in Manchuria and that
the first Chinese explosion will
occur late next year or early
in 1962.
“If a bomb is exploded
before then, Soviet assistance
is proved. But until it has,
it must be considered unlikely
that Mr. Khrushchev has
given China any but the barest
possible assistance in this
field.”
Inquiry Into Inquiries
/Commenting on a Tory mem-
ber’s request to the British
Prime Minister for information
on how many Royal Commis-
sions and committees-of-in-
quiry have been set-up in
Britain since 1955, John Baker
White, in London “Time and
Tide,” notes:
“The answer confirms the
opinion of observers that when
the Cabinet is faced with an
awkward question of policy it
hands it over to a committee
instead of taking an early
decision on a departmental in-
quiry.
“It may astonish even these
observers to know that in the
Jive years since 1955 the Gov-
ernment has set-up three Royal
Commissions and 67 commit-
tees-of-inquiry. Two of the
Common
Land and Remuneration of
Doctors and Dentists have
reported, taking respectively
31 and 35 months to arrive at
their conclusions. The third,
on the police, has, of course,
only just started on its delibera-
tions.
“Of the 67 committees 23
have not yet reported, while two
others have not reported finally.
Among those still deliberating
are Lord Ingleby’s Committee
on Children and Young Per-
sons, appointed in October,
1956.
“Fish seem to require a good
deal of thought. The Bledisloe
Committee on Salmon and
Freshwater Fisheries has been
at work for two years and four
months, and the Fleck Com-
mittee on the Fishing Industry
for one month less.
“The Cook Committee on
the Composition of Milk has
been meeting since May, 1958.
It would be interesting to know
why it took three years and
three months to produce a
report on the Forest of Dean,
and five months short of four
years for the Younghusband
Committee to deal with the
question of Social Workers.
“It is interesting to analyse
the number of questions
handed to commissions or com-
mittees in the respective years.
There were 13 in 1955, 10 in
1956, 19 in 1957, 12 in 1958,
and 12 in 1959. So far this
year four committees have been
set-up.”
Soekarno Supreme
President Soekarno’s sus-
pension of the Indonesian
Parliament, notes London
“Economist,” leaves him
“freer than ever, on paper, to
go on governing his republic
the way he thinks fit. He will
not, at all events, he hampered
by an elected body until the
partly elected People’s Con-
gress is created under the 1945
Constitution, at a date that
remains unannounced.
“It would be rash, however,
to attempt to predict the final
Constitutional pattern in this
country of scattered islands.
A few weeks ago the various
anti-Soekarno groups in Indo-
nesia proclaimed a ‘Union of
Indonesian States,’ which pos-
tulates a federal structure, as
opposed to the unitary State of
1945.”
The “New York Times”
adds that the process by which
Soekarno has increased his
personal power has been under
way ever since he “brought
back the basic formulas for his
‘guided democracy’ from his
visits to Soviet Russia and
Communist China in 1956.

“JACKSUL,” BRISBANE
Western Parliamentary demo-
cracy, with its many parties and
unstable Governments, was not
fitted for Indonesian condi-
tions, and though he further
complicated the situation by a
Javanese imperialist drive that
led to a revolt of other Indo-
nesian islands, the record of
that kind of democratic rule
in Indonesia as well as other
countries gives point to his
argument.
“That is why an increasing
number of these countries have
passed or are passing through
a phase of authoritarian, often
military, rule, and why those
countries which emerge from
it establish instead of a Parlia-
mentary democracy on the
British model a Presidential
Government on the American
model, with a strong Executive
which cannot be easily over-
thrown.
“The trouble is that Presi-
dent Soekarno espouses a line
that goes far beyond this and
envisages an Indonesian
‘Socialism’ on the Yugoslav
model. But great as President
Soekarno’s powers are in
theory, he is still dependent
on the Army, and the Army is
anti-Communist. In fact, it
backs the new regime mainly
because it can the better cope
with the well-organised Com-
munists, and it seems prob-
able that in a test of strength
between the two rival forces
the Army will prevail.”
The Manchester “Guardian”
notes that “the absence of
democracy in guided demo-
cracy would be more tolerable
if there were any guidance.
But the State staggers drunk-
enly from one crisis to another,
and the economy deteriorates
from year to year.
“The currency is failing,
prices are rising, rice and cloth
are getting harder to buy in
the towns. And President
SoekarnoJ's Government seems
to have no idea of how to
cope with this dangerous infla-
tion ; the stringent attempt at
a currency-reform last year
was a failure; so was the
imposition of price-ceilings
last month.
“A people that chooses a
charmer for its ruler may have
a heavy price to pay. But
there are signs that even the
patience of the Indonesians is
becoming exhausted. From
what the Speaker said [before
the suspension] Parliament will
need a lot of President

Dragnet Digest
London “Economist’’: “If
any Western influence is to
remain in North Africa, Soviet
policy would undoubtedly
prefer it to be French, not
American. Mr. Khrushchev
has no reason to want the
Algerian war to drive France
out of Africa at this stage.
His refusal to recognise the
Algerian rebel Government
(as the Chinese have done),
or to send arms to it, is likely
to continue. As long as the
war persists the French Army
is out of Europe ; this, after
all, is a more substantial
advantage to the Soviet Union
than having the French Army
back in France, even if it is
then withdrawn from Nato.”

Memphis [C/.S I .] “Commer-
cial Appeal’’: “The Dalai Lama,
the chief spiritual leader of
Tibet, is living as an exile in
India. If anyone has been
worrying about how he would
pay his way, he can forget
about it. It develops that the
gentleman, or some bf his
advisers, both owned and
exercised foresight when the
Red Chinese invaded Tibet in
1951.
“As soon as the Chinese
Reds showed-up, the Dalai
Lama’s people began to send
out mule-loads of gold bars
to India. Several hundred
mules so laden made it to
Sikkim, an Indian protectorate
in the Himalayas. The gold
was moved by truck from
Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim,
to a nearby airport and flown
to Calcutta, where it now rests
in bank-vaults.
“The Dalai Lama is only
24 years old, but a well-
informed source says he has
enough wealth to enable him
to live in comfort as long as
man’s mortal span has ever
been known to last. The
world would be better off, inci-
dentally, if everybody had
been as shrewd as the Dalai
Lama in estimating the Reds
and their purposes.”
“New York Times": “Some
of us are tempted to become
discouraged when the United
Nations cannot liberate Hun-
gary or permanently settle the
political problems of the
Middle East. Yet there are
tasks in the field of health, of
nutrition, of the general
improvement of the human
lot that the U.N. and its
specialised agencies can per-
form and do perform.
“This is a kind of struggle
against the adverse forces of
Nature in which no man can
ever be hurt and which, if
continued long enough, will
contribute immeasurably to
the happiness of people all
over the world.
“The Pakistan projects [by

long future they represent the
kind of human enterprise that

tunity is offered.”


opinion being that his widow
would sell the estate and return
to Australia. It turned out to
be wishful thinking. Luscious
Laura announced that she
would manage the estate her-
self. She liked the Island life,
she liked the easy-going
planters, and she was quite
capable of handling the native
labor. She sold her husband’s
ancient launch and imported a
new one that threw up a bow-
wash like a destroyer going into
action.
She cut quite a dash in that
new launch, and in one way
and another became as great a
menace afloat as she was
ashore. Once she cut close in
under the stern of Rusty's
anchored schooner just as he
lowered himself into the dinghy
to go ashore. Her bow-wa,sh
swamped the dinghy and half-
submerged Rusty. And since
he was wearing his best shore-
going whites he could scarcely
be blamed for the language he
used.
Luscious Laura throttled
down, swung back and returned
the compliments with interest
while I listened in awed silence,
certain that the two of them
would be enemies for life. Yet
when they met at a party that
night they were once again the
best of friends.
Laura hadn’t been invited,
but hostesses had long given
up the idea that they could
exclude her simply by not in-
viting her, because it was
obvious that if she felt like
attending a party she attended
it, with or without an invita-
tion. And after a time her
presence became accepted since
there was no host or hostess
daring enough to brave the lash
of her tongue by asking her to
leave.
The possible exception was
Rusty, who was a roving
bachelor with no regard for
the niceties of society and
whose parties usually took
place at the hotel. On one
occasion I heard him quieten
her with: “That’s enough from
you, Lush. No one invited you
into this party. Sit down and
shut up or you’ll go out on
your bloody neck.”
It was the. language she
understood, because she smiled
sweetly and shut up—at least
for a while.
She had been referred-to as
Luscious Laura for years, but
no one had actually addressed
her as Lush until Rusty started
the fashion. She took it as a
compliment and, in a way, it
probably was.
I left the Islands soon after
that and the only news I had
of Lush was when I ran into
one or other of the old hands.
Somehow her name always
cropped-up when old times
were mentioned. I heard that
she was one of the last to
escape from Rabaul before the
Japs captured it, and then I
heard no more of her until
about si x months before
Rusty’s visit to Brisbane.
T had driven down to the Gold
Coast to visit an old friend
who had been a Government
“Six seconds to the ground' s my record”
official in the Islands. He was
staying at the Hotel Trade-
winds, and we had arranged to
lunch there together.
“Take a look at the recep-
tionist,” he said as we walked
into the lounge; “see if you
recognise her.”
I looked, and since she was
busy checking-in some new
arrivals I was able to study
her carefully. I noticed first
her white hair, and then I saw
she was tall and handsome.
Distinguished-looking was the
description that seemed to fit
her best, and there was an air
of quiet assurance and dignity
about her. She was beautifully
groomed; so well preserved in
face and figure that it would
be impossible to guess her age.
That lovely white hair might
not mean a thing; she could
have been one of those women
whose hair turns grey early in
life. She was decidedly attrac-
tive, but I didn’t know her.
“No,” I said, turning back
to my friend. “I’ve never seen
her in my life. I wouldn’t be
likely to forget her if I had.
She looks like someone with a
background.”
My friend smiled. “She’s
got a background all right.
That's Lush. The one and only
Luscious Laura.”
“You’re joking!” I ex-
claimed.
“I’m enjoying a joke,” he
corrected. “But I’m telling
the truth. That regal, white-
haired matron is, or was, Lush.
Come over to the desk when
she finishes checking these
people in and I’ll collect my
mail. You’ll recognise her
voice at any rate.”
“Has she recognised you?”
“She must have. She had
my name in front of her. It's
not a very common name, and
apart from a few extra wrinkles
and a receding hair-line l
haven't changed much. And
besides, I had her up before
me on a disturbing-the-peace
charge when I was resident-
magistrate. I remember the
occasion well and I’ll bet she
does too. I gave her a father
of a lecture, fined her ten-quid
and warned her I’d raise it to
fifteen for contempt of court
when I heard her.say, ‘Bloody
extortion!’ But she didn’t bat
an eyelash when I walked in
here a few days ago. Acted as
though she’d never seen me in
her life. ‘Oh yes, Commander,’
she said with that unmistakable
accent. ‘We have your booking.
Room 75 on the first floor.
The boy will take you up.’
Coldly impersonal, that was
her. In fact you could say she
high-hatted me.”
“You didn’t say anything to
her about the Islands?”
“1 didn’t. And I don’t think
you would, either. She has
obviously buried her past, and
who are we that we should dig
it up?”
The newcomers moved away,
my friend collected his mail
while I stood beside him and
I heard Lush speak. She only
said four words, but I recog-
nised the voice at once. If she
recognised me she gave no sign
of it.
HTwo days after Rusty told his
A yarn about the marooned
missionary I saw him off for
the Gold Coast. I felt a little
guilty about pushing him of!
like that, but I comforted my-
self with the thought that Rusty
would enjoy himself wherever
he was. He’d discover kindred
spirits down at the Coast and
he'd be sure to discover Lush.
It would be interesting to
know how those two got on.
Would she ignore him as she
had ignored me? Would she
high-hat him as she had high-
hatted the ex-resident-magis-
trate? Or would she unbend
in a flood of memories?
It was a week before I heard
the whole story.
It was cool in the Trade-
winds lounge, cool with the
soft green coolness of potted
palms, and a little dim after
the brassy midday glare out-
side. Rusty walked straight to
the desk, but he didn’t look at
the receptionist. Instead he
stood with his back to the desk
and glanced around in the hope
of seeing a familiar face. As
he said afterwards, a bloke
never knew who he’d run into
in a joint like that.
Waiting for the new arrival
to turn, Lush took in the
tanned neck below the grizzled
hair, and the un-stylish coat
hanging loosely from the mas-
sive shoulders and summed the
man up as a grazier.
“Can I help you, sir?” she
asked graciously.
Rusty swung around. He
hadn’t seen one familiar face,
but by hell he knew that voice.
Could never mistake it. Nor
could he mistake the speaker,
despite the white hair.
“Well I’ll be ... ” Too sur-
prised to think what he’d be
he thrust out a huge hand.
“Lush! Me old pal, Lush.
How are ya?”
Ignoring the hand, Lush
looked at him coldly. “I’m
afraid you’re making, a mis-
take,” she said. “Is there
something you want?”
Rusty stood there grinning
for several moments before


saying: “I’m not making any
mistake, Lush, but if that’s how
you want it that’s the way I’ll
play it. So all I want now is
me room-number and key.
Would I be stretching the bonds
of an old friendship too far by
asking for ’em?”
“We have no vacancies at
the moment, sir.” It was a
desperate measure, but under-
neath her dignified calm Lush
was feeling desperate. “If you
try one of the other hotels they
may be able to accommodate
you.”
“I’m not asking for stray
vacancies; I’m asking for me
room. It’s booked, in the name
of Martin.” Rusty grinned
again. “It’s a name I still
ain’t ashamed of.”
She gave a fair imitation of
an efficient receptionist study-
ing the booking-list before say-
ing: “I’m sorry, sir. We have
no reservation in the name of
Martin.”
Rusty turned and walked
away, but if Lush thought she
had got rid of him she badly
underestimated her man. With-
in minutes he was back at the
desk with the manager.
And the manager was most
apologetic. He remembered
the booking clearly because it
had been made by a bank, the
bank that handled the Trade-
winds’ account. Presumably
this Mr. Martin was a grazier
with a nice credit-balance,
whereas the hotel had such a
nasty overdraft that the direc-
tors were being pressed to
reduce it. And since most
directors dislike pressure they
passed it on to their manager.
“I’m very sorry about this
unfortunate misunderstanding,
Mr. Martin,” he was saying.
“Your room is ready for you.
I’ll take you up myself.” The
look he shot at Lush plainly
said, “And when I come back
I'll deal with you, my fine
lady!”
“No need to apologise,”
Rusty told him genially. “We
all make mistakes. Wouldn't
make anything if we didn’t.
Come into the bar and have a
drink and forget all about it.”
"O usty enjoyed his stay at the
Hotel Tradewinds. He
kept his promise to Lush and
played the game her way.
Without mentioning her name
or giving the slightest hint that
he was addressing an old friend
he greeted her cheerfully every
morning, leaned on the desk
and passed some casual remark
about the weather when he
asked for his mail later in the
day, and generally behaved
like one of the many male
guests who thought the recep-
tionist attractive and efficient.
On the fourth morning he
advanced a step further and
said: “Seems to be quite a
boom on down here. Is it
always like this?”
“Yes, Mr. Martin.” she
answered. “Always.”
At noon next day when he
stopped at the desk for his mail
Lush gave the first indication
that she was weakening.
“Mr. Martin,” she said
sweetly. “I want to thank you
for your attitude to the mana-
ger over the booking.” ,
“Think nothing of it,” he
told her. “It’s like I said, we
all make mistakes. Made a
few meself in me time. But up
where I come from nobody
bothers about that sorta thing.”
It must have been the right
line because she asked, “Have
you left the Islands alto-
gether?”
“Me!” Rusty looked quite
shocked at the suggestion
“Why would I leave?” With
a wave of his arm he indicated
the hotel lounge and everyone
in it. “This sort of thing is
right enough for a week or two,
but could you see a bloke like
me living down here?”
Apparently Lush couldn't,
for she made a noise suspici-
ously like a sigh before asking,
“How are things up there these
days?”
“Better than ever. You’d be
surprised at the way they’ve
picked-up since the war. I’ve
even expanded a bit meself.
Invested a bit of me hard-
earned dough That’s what
brought me to Brisbane. Had
to come down to finalise the
deal.”
“Many of the old hands left
up there?”
Catching the wistful tone of
her question Rusty said: “Too
right. You’d be surprised at
the way they started drifting
back after the war. Any time
you feel like it, say the word
and we’ll get together over a
bit of lubrication and have a
yarn about old times.”
“Eight o’clock tonight,” she
agreed without hesitation.
“Wait for me outside and we’ll
walk round to one of the other
hotels.”
When the bars closed that
night Lush had only heard a
fraction of the latest Island
gossip and was thirsting for
more. She was also, she ad-
mitted, thirsting for another
drink.
They returned to the Hotel
Tradewinds and went up to
Rusty’s room. Rusty called
room-service and ordered a

" set out on the small table
provided by a thoughtful man-
agement Lush drew up a chair
and said, “Tell me about this
new investment of yours,
Rusty.”
“I’ve bought a pub.”
“Good heavens! I can’t
quite picture you as a publi-
can.”
“Well, that makes two of us.
I couldn’t have pictured you
working in a joint like this if
I hadn’t seen it meself. Do you
like the job?”
“Like it!” She spat the
words out. “It’s hell. Plain
bloody hell. But one has to
live.” Thoughtfully she drained
her glass and asked, “Do I
know this place you’ve
bought?”
“Too right you do, Lush.
It’s the old Astrolabe.”
Yes, Lush remembered it
well, a delightful spot, set right
on the sea-front to catch every
breath of cooling breeze. Coco-
nut palms, crotons and hibiscus
surrounded it and its sloping
stretch of lawn extended right
to high-water mark.
“It wants a bit of dough
spending on it to bring it up to
scratch,” Rusty continued. “But
I’ll get a bloke on to it as soon
as I get back.”
“And you’re going to retire
from the sea?”
“No bloody fear I’m not. I
bought the joint as an invest-
ment and because I thought it
might be a good idea to have
somewhere to hang me hat up
when I get too old to work.
I’ll put a manager in it to look
after it, but you know how it
is up there, Lush; it ain’t easy
to find the right bloke for a
job like that.”
Several drinks later Lush
kicked her shoes off and
placed both feet on the table,
dangerously hocking the whisky
bottle and upsetting Rusty’s
glass. “You know, Rusty,”
she said with impressive
dignity. “You don’t need a
manager for that pub of yours.
What you need is a manageress,
a woman of mature years,
preferab—” She hesitated for
a moment. “That’s an ex-
tremely difficult word to pro-
nounce under certain condi-
tions. I was about to say,
preferably one with Island ex-
perience.”
Rusty scratched his head
thoughtfully. The drinks were
even catching-up on him.
“Ya know, Lush,” he said
at last, “I think you’ve got
something there.”
“Too bloody right I’ve got
something,” she agreed. “And
you’ve got something too, Rus.
You’ve got yourself a mana-
geress. When do we leave?”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Finger-talk
1 read recently in the “S.M.
Herald” that Mr. O'Grady, of
the anthropological department
of Sydney University, is again
going to visit the Port Hed-
land district of W.A. to gather
more data about the aborigines
there. Although I know
O’Grady to be a sincere and
painstaking student of abo-
rigines, I’m afraid it's getting
too late to gather much reliable
information about aboriginal
dialects, because before you
can contact the real old full-
bloods you have to seek the
help and conversation of partly
detribalised aborigines, whose
information is unreliable.
Some authorities say that
there are as many as 500
dial e c ts among Australia's
aborigines. Then again, no
fully initiated old-man black-
fellow will tell you much about
tribal secrets and words. This
is forbidden by tribal law.
For example, our tribal
aborigines have a wonderful
s'gn-language called “finger-
talk,” which is just as efficient
as our deaf-and-dumb hand-
talk. The signs and what they
represent are a mystery to most
white men. I never met a man
who understood them.
1 first saw finger-talk in
1901, when I lived in the Simp-
son Desert country. All the
natives of that country have
died-out now. Sixty years ago
aborigines from all over
Western Queensland would
visit that country in good
seasons to gather the famous
pituri, which grows in the
sandhills there.
Pituri is an indigenous nar-
cotic. The bush aborigines
used to gather and dry the
leaves, then roll them into a
small ball to chew. It had the
same effect on them as alcohol
or opium, making them drowsy
or quarrelsome. Pituri was a
great article of barter, and the
old “murnongers”— i.e., a cer-
tain type of white man —would
always carry a bag of it as a
lure for the aboriginal women.
When the visiting aborigines
had gathered their supply of
pituri they would say goodbye
with much shouting to the local
aborigines. Then, when they
were about a hundred yards on
their way, they would turn
round and shout more fare-
wells. The farewells would
continue until they were too
far away to be heard. Then
they would use finger-talk.
I once stood on the top of
a sandhill with an old black-
fellow who was muttering to
himself and waving his hands
in signs to the departing
aborigines. Of course, I didn't
understand what he was try-
ing to say, but my aboriginal-
boy mates told me that every
time he touched his knee the
old man was talking to his
“I'll be glad when this is over — I've got a
splitting headache."
uncle. That was as far as 1
got.
I must explain that much of
what 1 know about aboriginal
lore was told to me by my
aboriginal-boy mates, for boys
are boys the world over and
will tell other boys things they
won’t tell grown men.
1 saw finger-talk again in
1904, over in the wild Oba-
gooma country at the back of
Yampi Sound (W.A.). Some
“munjongs”—a Kimberley
word for wild bush-aborigines
-—in a police chain-gang for
alleged cattle-killing, made
finger-talk to my stock-boy
Sambo, so I asked him “What
name?” He replied: “All
about been talk alonga me and
askem what my country.” Later
some “munjongs” came and
visited me, sat on the ground
and finger-talked to Sambo.
Their faces were expressionless,
they just moved their fingers
about quietly and quickly, but
Sambo seemed to understand
everything they said: he told
me later that some of them
were “jeegull” to him — i.e.,
must not talk to him in the
ordinary way.
In 1912 I met that grand
old lady Mrs. Daisy Bates. I
gave her a list of 200 words
from the dialect of my country.
She was delighted, but she
knew very little about finger-
talk. That was before she went
to live at Ooldea Soak among
the aborigines on the Nullar-
bor. I'm afraid that any real
knowledge of aboriginal finger-
talk is lost now. — Michael
Sawtell (N.S.W.).
Underground Water
World War II shocked Eng-
land and France into realis-
ing that the underground
water tapped by their age-old
wells was exhaustible (B.
9/3/’6O).
The hundreds of thousands
of troops concentrated in Eng-
land in readiness for D-Day
used water so lavishly that
first the wells and then the
crops on southern England’s
chalk-hills began to fail.
The troops, when they
reached Normandy, continued
their high water-consumption
until French wells, driven
deeper and deeper, were drain-
ing the English wells across
the Channel.
If this can happen in lands
as well - watered as England
and France, the probability is
that Australian artesian sources
are even more exhaustible. —
Emel (Vic.).
Migrants and the Law
Ignorance of the law is never
accepted in couft as an excuse
for breaking it, however petty
the offence. Yet, in lower-court
circles particularly, it is heard
nowadays more than ever as
a more-or-less common defence
of foreign-born New
Australians.
I wonder whether State
authorities, apart from pro-
viding English-language classes
and other strictly educational
services aimed at helping new-
comers to become assimilated,
take any steps to teach them
something about the many
minor laws, over and above our
criminal code?
The rate at which European
Naussies are being hauled
before the Beak for various
petty offences would suggest
there's little or nothing done in
this direction. Meanwhile,
there’s an ever-increasing and
pitiful stream of foreigners
attending Courts of Petty
Sessions, in city and country
alike, to answer —and invari-
ably plead guilty to and
ignorance of —charges involv-
ing such things as minor traffic-
laws, firearms regulations,
health regulations, local-govern-
ment by-laws, etc. It isn’t
much inducement to good
citizenship when a newcomer,
before having had time to
master the English language,
finds himself with a black
mark against his name.
What might help would be
a booklet, printed in various
languages, dealing with the
lesser but everyday levels of
the law (petty offences). Such
a booklet could be distributed
to migrants on arrival. It
would be money well spent, for
there’s no knowing how far-
reaching the psychological
effect of such experiences
might be on a foreigner’s
ultimate citizenship.
Besides, it might tajce any
New Australian, even a Briton,
quite a. time to learn off-hand
some of our many minor laws.

“Letters From the River”
I should like to make a few
comments on the review of
Letters From the River (B.
9/3/’6O).
First, the letters were genuine.
The reviewer has no grounds
whatever for his assumption
that they were “cooked-up by
some member of the paper’s
staff.” Had he bothered to
read the letters he would have
discovered this for himself, for
the writer describes minutely
each phase of his journey, and
also places the date at the top
of each one.
The reviewer next
(it can only be an assumption,
for it is certainly not a fact)
that the writer of these letters
was “under the awful necessity
of placating his few and pre-
carious subscribers.” Again,
had the reviewer really read
the letters he would have found
remarks about Hay and other
towns (and about individuals,
and the residence of that awe-
some public figure William
Macleay) that were far from
placatory.
Country journalists then
were no more afraid to state
their opinions than they are
today, and certainly did nop
find it necessary to “placate
their few and precarious sub-
scribers,” and thus be lumped
by the reviewer with Com-
munists and the like. I find all
the reviewer’s remarks on
country journalists gratuitously
insulting.'
Finally, the reviewer, having
exercised himself against some-
thing which exists in his
imagination and not in the
book, comes to the astonish-
ing conclusion that “this is
quite a readable account of the
trip down the river, with many
useful pieces of local history.”
For this 1 am, as I am no
doubt expected to be, grateful;
and for his benefit would add
that the sole purpose of reviv-
ing these letters was to bring
to life an actual and factual
account of a trip down the
Murrumbidgee in a river-
steamer in the ’seventies which
would otherwise have remained
“ That's strange—the paint is still Wet .”
buried in a country news-
paper’s files.
I still think that the job was
worth doing, just as I think
that the many letters of 19th-
century journa 1 i st s who
travelled our inland, and had
their remarks published in
newspapers all over Australia,
would also bear revival or
resuscitation, for they are
neglected but valuable fields of
historical information.
Who knows, perhaps some-
one, even better qualified than
the Irvin “who is an accom-
plished poet,” might find this,
book at some time in the future
and write a good history of the
river, using its facts as a back-
ground. Certainly he would
not know of their existence if
Letters From the River had not
been published.— Eric Irvin
(N.S.W.).
[The reviewer replies: I did not
deny that the letters genuinely
described a trip down the river.
What I did deny was that as letters
(from “Tom” to “Allan”) they were
genuine: the epistolary form was
obviously just a device adopted by
the Wagga Wagga “Advertiser’s”
unknown contributor to put his
observations into a style he thought
would appeal to his readers. Why
doesn’t Eric Irvin settle the ques-
tion once and for all by finding out
who wrote them? I am sorry, how-
ever, that he took offence at my
remarks on the country journalists
of long ago; perhaps I should
explain that, having once edited a
country paper when its subscribers
were extremely few and precarious,
I was really insulting, if anyone,
myself.—D.S.]
Salesmanship Problems
If anyone deserves sym-
pathy in this era of unpre-
cedented! prosperity it’s the
salesman. His trouble, poor
chap, is that the customer has
no longer to be talked into
buying something he wants
and can’t really afford, but
persuaded into dissatisfaction
with what he already has.
No easy task —particularly
for the salesman brought-up
on the principle that breaking
through buyer-resistance means
playing-up the customer’s
desire to possess and playing-
down the inner voice that
urges prudence.
The new technique, to quote
an Amercian salesmanship
authority, consists of “creating
discontent to make buyers
act.”
According to a leading
marketing - consultant, there
are two basic steps in creating
discontent: “First, the forma-
tion of an entirely new stan-
dard for judging ( the pros-
pect’s situation, different from
the present standard which the
prospect is using and which
keeps him satisfied ; secondly,
getting him to adopt the new
standard as his own so that
what may have measured-up
before now falls short.”
A simple example cited by
this authority: A housewife
may be quite satisfied with
her brand of household soap ;
but tell her that another brand
makes clothes smell fresh as
well as look clean, and she’ll
set-up a new standard by
which she’ll regard her present
brand as unsatisfactory because
it merely cleans.
Even in the critical business-
world this approach works:
“A company may suddenly
invest in a new ceiling to
deaden noise. The noise was
there all along, but the
chances, are no one would ever
have noticed it if a salesman
hadn’t pointed it out.”
Selling by this technique
clearly calls for much imagin-
ation and ingenuity—especially
when the salesman has to
create discontent with his
firm’s own products. This, of
course, can be done—really
smart salesmanship can make
the buyer dissatisfied imme-
diately he’s bought an article
—but it has to be done care-
fully or the whole thing will
backfire: —
You may be changing a model,
improving it in some way and
raising the price slightly. You
want to clear out the old model
and switch to the new. It’s touchy,
and you have to be subtle about
it or you’ll lose the old business
and end up with nothing. It
you’ve been saying for years that
Model X is wonderful you can’t
suddenly say it’s no good. The
only thing you can do is to go
slow, boosting the advantages of
Model Y and letting the customer
come to think for himself that
Model X really is outdated after all.
Although this discontent-
making has worked fairly well
so far, salesmanship’s chickens
have a habit of coming home
to roost. When customers
generally wake-up to the
subtleties of dissatisfaction-
selling, they’ll tend to develop
a sense of complacency —or,
conceivably, such pride in their
possessions that the salesman’s
urging will become an insult.
Either way, the salesman
has my sympathy. If pros-
perity persists he’ll simply


have to find a new, customer-
proof gimmick. Ardoyne

Jews and Christians
Recent discussion in the Syd-
ney Jewish newspaper on the
possible relationship between
the leaching of Christianity in
some quarters and outbreaks
of anti-Semitism is of wide
general interest.
In raising the issue, Colonel
D. J. Benjamin said the Gospels
did not say the Jews killed
Jesus, but over the centuries
the story has been presented so
as to throw the whole responsi-
bility onto the Jews, and in
many Sunday-schools it was
still taught in that way. He
urged that the method of
presentation should be altered,
without impugning the truth of
what was written, so that the
Jews would be given fair-play,
and future Jews saved from
what their ancestors suffered.
He set out a series of pro-
positions which, he said, the
Jews could fairly ask Sunday-
schools to teach —all, except
one, admitting the truth of the
New Testament accounts.
These included the fact that
while the attitude of the Jeru-
salem mob, or part of it, would
seem to show that at least some
of the p o p u la c e supported
action against Jesus, this in
itself afforded no criticism of
the Jews as a whole, and cer-
tainly not of their descendants.
The trial was conducted in
contravention of Jewish law.
The fear that Jesus was likely
to become a political leader as
well as a religious teacher im-
pelled both Jewish collabora-
tors and Roman rulers to
action; Crucifixion was a
Roman, not a Jewish, punish-
ment. At that time no death-
penalty could be imposed by
Jewish courts.
This argument provoked
some approving Christian re-
plies. Dr. L. Rumble, of the
Roman Catholic Church, said
that Colonel Benjamin was
right in holding that the respon-
sibility lay on the collabora-
tors and the Roman officials,
not on the masses, and that
this did not afford grounds for
condemning Jews. The par-
ticular group of simple Jewish
people assembled for the
occasion had been the victims
of mass hysteria. Dr. Rumble
added: “Even as it would be
good if Colonel Benjamin’s
objective, fair and dispassion-
ate outlook were inculcated in
Jewish children, so Christian
children should be taught,
whenever the question arises,
that the Jews have as much
right to just treatment, com-
mon brotherhood and kindli-
ness of thought, word and deed
as anybody else.”
Another noted Christian
leader, the Rev. Gordon
Powell, Presbyterian, of Syd-
ney, said he had only twice in
49 years heard the suggestion
that Jews were responsible for
the death of Jesus. He had
never heard it from a Christian
pulpit or in a Christian Sunday-
school. If non-Jews had ex-
pressed such a view, he said,
then they were certainly not
worthy of the name of
Christian. The Christian church
detested everything connected
with anti-Semitism.
The discussion may have
some effect on inquiries cur-
rently being made into the
causes of outbreaks in Aus-
tralia and elsewhere of anti-
Semitism and neo-Nazism.
Charles Meeking (N.S.W.).
Look and Say
After reading “0.F.M.” cor-
respondence about the “look
and say’’ method adopted in
Queensland for teaching child-
ren to read, I’d like to place a
vote in its favor.
My daughter was in Grade I
last year—the inaugural year
of the method —and is now one
of the guinea-pigs for introduc-
ing it into the Grade II
syllabus.
I don’t imagine for one
moment that by the time she
has reached scholarship stand-
ard she'll be any more ad-
vanced than her counterparts
who have learnt by the old
method; but how much more
interesting it is for child and
parent!
My own memories of Prep. I
are of constant repetition and
of reading such lines as “The
cat sat on the mat,” whereas
my daughter can read with
pride any of the many books
especially written, in co-ordina-
tion with the syllabus, to em-
brace all the new words she
has learnt.
I'm sure that at her age I
would have had no idea of how
to spell such words as Novem-
ber, December, Christmas,
elephant; but by gazing at her
imaginary word-picture she is
able to name each letter as she
sees it, and spells the words
correctly.
By fostering a keener in-
terest in learning right from the
start, this method must prove
beneficial. However, some of
the pitfalls ahead, pointed out
by “K.A.L.” (B. 24/ 2/’6O), are
outlined in a poem 1 read
recently:
When the English tongue we speak,
Why is break not rhymed with
freak ?
Do you tell me why it’s true,
We say sew but likewise few.
Beard sounds not the like with
heard,
Word is different from sword,
Cow is cow, but low is low,
Shoe is never rhymed with foe.
And since pay is rhymed with say,
Why not paid with said we pray?
Think of hose and those and lose
And of goose and yet of choose,
Think of comb and tomb and
bomb,
Doll and roll and home and
some,
We have blood and food and good,
Mould is not pronounced like
would,
Wherefore done bpit gone and
lone.
Is there any reason known ?
And in short it seems to me,
Sounds and letters disagree.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
ZEBU-CROSS DAIRY-CATTLE
“Myall”: Animal-husbandry
officers of the Queensland
Department of Agriculture aim
to establish a breed of dairy-
cattle suitable for Central and
North Queensland. The Ayr
Regional Experimental Station,
near Townsville, is to be re-
organised for dairy-production,
and will become the centre of
their activities.
In 1952 the C.5.1.R.0. im-
ported several Sahiwal Zebu
bulls and cows from Pakistan.
These have been held in
quarantine at Werribee (Vic.),
and C.5.1.R.0. has now pre-
sented the Queensland depart-
ment with a purebred Sahiwal
bull and two half-Sahiwal’-half-
Jersey bulls as foundation
breeding-stock. The three bulls
will be mated with Jersey,
Friesian and A.I.S. cows, the
object being to combine the
Sahiwal’s ability to thrive in

bulls, and progeny have proved
better adapted o tropical con-
ditions than pure British breeds.
The Santa Gertrudis breed,
imported from the U.S. about
10 years ago and now very
popular in Queensland and
N.S.W., is a cross between
American beef-cows and Zebu
bulls. This breed has proved
superior to purebred British
cattle in Queensland, and at a
recent stud-sale at Eidsvold the
top price of 1750gns. vva« paid
for a 16-months-old crossbred
heifer in calf to a Santa Ger-
trudis bull. Crosses of British
dairy-cows and Zebu bulls
should also prove suitable for
the warmer districts.
This work will be followed
by selection for production, to
find a type capable of high
milk-yields in the tropics. The
scheme is a long-term one,
because it calls for selective
breeding. Each new generation
will take about three years to
breed, and as the work pro-
gresses the value of the Zebu-
cross in dairy-breeding will be
thoroughly tested.
Conditions in North Queens-
land affect cattle in various
ways. On hot days British
cattle prefer to remain in the
shade rather than feed —a re-
duction of grazing-time. Also
external parasites, especially
ticks, cause production to de-
cline, and they necessitate
regular dipping, with con-
sequent expense and loss of
time.
It has been established that
Zebu types are better in con-
trolling body-temperature; their
coat is less insulating, and,
with more and bigger sweat-
glands, they can sweat more
than British breeds. Selection
will fairly quickly modify
British breeds towards the
Zebu type of coat, sweating-
rate and temperature-control.
In the Sahiwal breed, one of
the highest milk-producers of
all Zebu cattle, selected cows
have produced up to 1200
gallons of milk in a lactation,
with butterfat-content ranging
from 4.3 per cent, to 6 per
cent. In body-weight the breed
is about equal to the Guernsey.
Sahiwals are usually a reddish-
dun color, often with dark-
brown and black points, and
occasionally with white mark-
ings on the body.
Zebu crosses are said to do
better on poor-quality feed
than British breeds, and this,
too, is being investigated.
Departmental officers, experi-
menting with an addition of
tropical legumes to natural
grasses have found that loss of
protein during winter and early
spring can be effectively coun-
tered by inclusion of legumes
in the pasture. Trials with
lucerne as a dairyfarm legume
have been encouraging.
The development of this
work, in conjunction with im-
proved bree d i n g-methods,
opens-up an interesting outlook
for the Queensland dairy-in-
dustry.
The Chisel-plough
P. A. Yeomans: An ex-
cellent little article headed
“Cultivation Methods” in
“Man on the Land” (B.
9/3/’6O), credited me with the
invention of the chisel-plough.
Here, however, are the facts:
I designed and built a chisel-
plough for my own use in 1946.
This implement was designed
in the hope that the results of
disk-plough and mouldboard-
plough cultivation, which over
any period of time seems to
have an unhappy consequence
of deteriorating the fertility of
the soil, would be reversed by
the use of a chisel-plough. I
classed this first implement a
failure because its weight and
rigidity placed it outside the
usual power-range of the
smaller farm-tractor.
The chisel-plough which I
introduced to the Australian
land-man in early 1953 was a
totally different implement, in
that the rigidity of the former
failure was replaced by the
flexibility which 1 had seen in
an American plough. While
our chisel-plough is not a direct
copy of another plough, its
design owes quite a lot to the
American design mentioned.
I believe our plough was the
first implement made that
would satisfactorily operate
behind all types of farm-trac*
tors, work in country previ-
ously impossible to cultivate,
and as well improve all other
land. I also believe that we
added a great deal to the
technique of cultivation with
the introduction of Keyline in
1952, which made the chisel-
plough the outstanding imple-
ment for the improvement of
soil.
Farmers all over Australia,
who now own more chisel-
ploughs per cent, than farmers
in any other country in the
world, can vouch for the fact
that the type of cultivation pro-
duced by the chisel-plough and
following Keyline methods has
greatly improved the depth and
fertility of their soil.
Pine-tree Slaughter
• “Nick’': Pine-trees, immune
from mistletoe, have to contend
with much quicker and more
deadly destroyers. Of all the
trees in our bush, they suffer
most from the ravages of man.
Two yearly assaults are
made on pine-saplings. In
early spring seekers of tomato-
stakes invade the bush, chop-
ping-down young trees and
axe i n g branches from the
sturdiest and best-grown sap-
lings. The second wave comes
at Christmas, when countless
saplings are sacrificed as deco-
rations for private homes and
places of business.
As a result many stands of
pine have disappeared and

others are being worked-out
with no prospect of replace-
ment by young timber. Short-
age of logs in the timber mills
has put up the price and has
also caused some mills to close-
down.
Manufacture of plastic
Christmas-trees has had very
little effect where young pines
are easy to obtain. If sale of
these plastic trees was en-

tricts might also help to curb
destruction.
Otherwise the only pine-

of miles often involved.
Cultivation Methods
“R.H.G.”: At no time have
I suggested that soil-erosion
isn’t a problem (and neither, of
course, does Yeomans in any
of his writings). I have simply
pointed out that conventional
methods of dealing with this
problem are not imaginative
enough, not positive enough,
and tend to be defeatist.
I can assure “Gravelsnatcher”
(B. 2/ 3/ ’6O) that I fully
appreciate the Soil Conserva-
tion service, and as a Road
Board engineer I need no tell-
ing that measures are proposed
through local-authorities to
enforce these conventional
methods. I have had the
opportunity of studying some
of these methods over the past
five or six years; in my opinion
they have proved completely
useless.
Far be it from me to criticise
the expert and helpful advice
of the department’s field-offi-
cers, of which I have often
availed myself, but knowing a
bit about Government depart-
ments I can see that certain
ideas have been established as
departmental procedure, and
woe betide anyone who runs
counter to them.
A great many of these ideas
are only matters of opinion,
not established facts. To men-
tion one only. The depart-
mental theory is to lay your
place out so as to provide
suitable grassed waterways for
the escape of floods; in fact all
Water. I believe Yeomans is
right when he points out that
it is possible to conserve all
Water on the place, up to a
quantity never likely to be
reached in our rainfalls. I can
see the amazing difference this
must produce if successful.
Looking at my own block, and
checking back on rainfall-
figures, and with my local
knowledge of a quarter-century
of looking after its floods, I
feel convinced that I can do
it, and am making plans
accordingly. It is, after all,
only a matter of elementary
hydraulics, and careful engin-
eering survey.
Corn
“Kune”: Maize is probably
the greatest multiplier of all
cultivated plants. A single
grain planted and producing its
usual two cobs yields anything
from 500 to 600 mature grains
which, replanted the following
season, should normally pro-
duce enough seed to sow
(spaced at lOin. in rows 3ft.
apart) about 14 acres. A
normal harvest from this crop
would yield enough seed to
plant nearly 7000 acres—all
from one solitary stalk in three
years!
The Humble Ute
“Fruit Cocky”: Of mechani-
cal aids to the man on the land,
the one most taken for granted
is the utility-truck. It does
everything from odd jobs in
the paddock to taking the
family camping on holidays.
Under the provisions of the
N.S.W. State Transport Act,
however, the farmer’s legal
right tO use his Utility is ex-
tremely restricted. According
to the conditions set-out on
his registration-certificate, it
appears that he may carry
members of his own family,
but must not give a lift to his
friends.
He may take along a work-
man to assist with the load,
but no other employee. A
neighbor’s child may be driven
to school, but not, for instance,
to hospital —or anywhere else,
for that matter. His own pro-
duce may be carried for 50
miles ; any further, and he
must queue-up at the local
motor-transport office for a
permit, and may be liable to
pay a road-tax of 3d. per ton-
mile —not per ton of load,
mark you, but per ton (or part
thereof) of the full weight of
vehicle, plus its maximum
capacity.
If, on a trip to the distant
city, Mum happens to snap-up
a bargain wardrobe, just right
for the spare-room, it must be
put on rail, and the ute driven
home empty —or a permit
obtained and road-tax paid.
All these impositions may
make sense when applied to
heavy vehicles operating for
profit in competition with the
railways, but as far as the
farmer and his utility are con-
cerned they are just plain
comic-opera.
I never yet heard of a cocky
who refused a ride to a friend
or hesitated to throw a few
sheets of iron onto the ute
because he was over ,50 miles
from home and had no pink
form. Over the years the
authorities have been lenient,
but there have lately been
signs of a change.
The N.S.W. Government
seems to be intensifying its
almost 30-year-old battle with
road-transport, and even the
farmer’s humble utility seems
to be coming under fire.
N.S.W. primary - producers
are allowed a small registra-
tion concession, but most of
them would probably be happy
to pay full rates if they were
left in peace to drive their
utilities without getting en-
tangled in red tape, restrictions
and road-taxes.
Blue Oat-mite
“Acacia”: The blue oat-
mite, widely distributed
throughout Australia and
sometimes called the pea-mite,
is oval in shape, one-thirtieth
of an inch long and purplish-
blue in color, with bright-red
legs. Its eggs are laid on the
upper surface of leaves, usually
singly, but sometimes in groups
of three or four.
If infestation is suspected,
test the crop by shaking a few
stems over a sheet of paper,
when the mites may be detected
as they drop off. Both imma-
ture and adult mites feed on
the upper surfaces of the
leaves during late afternoon
and evening; they shelter
either in the soil or on the
bases of the plants during day-
light. Plants damaged by
mites become bleached and
their older leaves die (these
symptoms are generally most
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(17/3/’60)
Queensland should have heavy rains on the north
coastal districts and the Peninsula during April, although
the rest of the State may have poor rainfall, apart from
moderate falls on a section of the central and south coastal
areas. Good rains should fall in the south-eastern districts
during May, and in eastern Queensland during June.
N.S.W. may have poor rainfall during April, apart
from moderate falls along the coast. General rains should
occur in May, with heavy falls in the coastal districts and
on the Southern Tablelands and South-west Slopes. Serious
flooding is likely in the eastern half of the State. The
rains should continue in June, possibly with more flooding.
Rainfall looks like being patchy in Victoria during
April, although moderate rains are indicated in the central
division, and in Gippsland and the west-coast districts.
Good seasonal rains are indicated in May. Rainfall may be
patchy in the second half of the year.
Moderate rains are likely in the agricultural areas and
west-coast districts of South Australia during April, with
good rains in the agricultural areas during May.
Western Australia may have poor rainfall during April,
apart from good rains in the lower south-coastal districts

Bandicoots
“J. 0.”: If “Anti-Cruelty’
(B. 24/2 / ’6O) lived in that par
of North Queensland boundec
by Cardwell in the south
Thursday Island in the north
and the Great Dividing Range
in the west he’d have to forget
about trapping and exterminat
ing bandicoots—they’re pro-
tected fauna in that area.
However, I can sympathise
with him. As conductor of
“Nature Notes” in a North
Queensland daily I meet many
farmers with legitimate com-
plaints against bandicoots. I’ve
always advocated total protec-
tion, because most wild things
when weighed in the balance
of good against harm come
out on the credit-side. But it’s
impossible to disregard some
of the complaints.
A farmer at Atherton told
me he had always spared
bandicoots because he knew
that the small damage they
did to his crops was out-
weighed by their depredations,
against insects, particularly
those with a subterranean
larval stage. In the last year
or two, however, they had
been changing their feeding-
habits, and were now attacking
peanuts and young maize. He
also had incontrovertible
evidence that one bandicoot
has burrowed under the netting
of a fowlhouse and destroyed
chickens and eaten eggs.
The natural diet of bandi-
coots is grubs, worms, small
lizards and occasional roots.
During the last two or three
years intensive chemical war-
fare has robbed them of
natural foodstuffs—and there’s
not very much difference
between a juicy lizard and a
newly-hatched chick.
It is the old story of Nature
adapting her children to chang-
ing conditions. I advised the
farmer to approach the
Minister for Agriculture—pre-
ferably through his Q.D.O. or
some other recognised grower-
organisation—and ask that
bandicoots might be declared
pests in his area. As the
natural habits of fauna are
changed, so the law, too,
should meet altered conditions.
Profiteering

firms whose prices for spare-
parts bore no relation to cost
of production were criticised by
delegates at a meeting of Wim-
mera district-council of the

Australian Primary Producers’
Union.
One instanced having had
to buy three starter-motors, the
third of which was faulty. He
had been charged £l4 for a
replacement of his tractor’s
damaged starter-ring gear, but
when he said he would have
his union make inquiries the
price had been reduced to £B.
Another instance was the
reduction, after investigation
by the A.P.P.U., of a firm’s
quoted price of £l5O to £5O for
a complete manifold, including
all studs, gaskets, etc.
Merino Wool, 1960
“Riverine”: Against the
decline in prices for medium
and medium-fine Merino wool,
a review of the bidding and
the extent of demand from
France, England and the Iron
Curtain countries shows that
this wool remains as much in
the picture as ever.
Clips from N.S.W.’s South-
west Slopes opened-up well on
the floor at the woolstore, and
a short conversation with
prospective buyers confirmed
that these clips were up to
specification for quality, quan-
tity and classing. After our
own firm had given us a valua-
tion lower than we were
expecting I had fears for the
market, but these were some-
what calmed when a represen-
tative of the buyer assured me
the wool “was all right.”
In January prices for the
Gundagai district in this area
were generally round 8 Id. a
pound. Graziers who moaned
that the opening January sale
was generally lower had to
retract their remarks later. By
allotting date of sale, wool-
firms invariably select appro-
priate cataloguing. Gundagai
graziers are finding it better to
start shearing in September
instead of October, provided
the sheep have a full 12
months growth of wool, and
the first quota is sent in as
soon as it’s baled, so that it
can be catalogued in Decem-
ber or January. In past years
November sales have invari-
ably been a couple of pence a
pound lower than the Decem-
ber-January sales.
Dams
“Ranger”: During the dry
spell in 1957 many new dams
were sunk and old ones cleared-
out round the N.S.W. South-
west Slopes. Costs were rela-
tively high, but there was
plenty of earthmoving-equip-
ment available to do the work
quickly and efficiently.
The importance of greater
water-storage and use of any
excess to irrigate pastures,
wherever the land permits it,
are lessons taught by any
drought. Another lesson—
which, however, seems almost
totally ignored—is that earth
removed from dams to renew
or enlarge holding-capacitie
can be washed down from the
unprotected banks, thus pro
viding a vicious-circle of di
removed at heavy expens
being washed back to b
scooped out again at consider
able cost.
It’s a waste of time anc
money to spread fertiliser anc
seed, as is sometimes o
recently-dug clay or othe
unsuitable soil in the attemp,
to grow grass. Any herbag
resulting from this is small i
quantity and useless as stock
feed. It is worth the effor
to spread as much topsoil a
possible on the top and side
of a dam’s banks. Although
it may be a thin and irregula
coating, this foundation fo
grass will give results unde
normal conditions.
Once established the gras
both stops erosion and pro
vides a valuable nibble fo
watering stock. With shelter
trees nearby, the dam can
become the focal-point of the
farm, lessening time and work
taken in musters and routine
stock - inspections, because
stock will frequently gather
there.
Phasey-bean
“Myall”: Phasey - bean
(Phaseolus lathyroides) is a
drought-resistant annual suit-
able for conditions in the
northern half of Australia.
Frost cuts it badly, but the
plant is a free-seeder and
quickly comes away with the
first spring rains.
In favorable conditions it
will grow to 6ft. or Bft. in a
few weeks, but in dry times
2ft. to 3ft. is its normal height.
It produces very palatable
foliage, which cattle relish
once they acquire the taste.
Being high in protein, it
increases milk-production.
Phasey-bean will succeed on
various types of well-drained
land, including fairly acid soils
and clay-loams. The seed is
small, about the size of that
of subterranean-clover. A
rate of 21b. to 31b. to the acre,
if sown alone, or |lb. in mix-
ture with grasses, is sufficient.
Spring and summer are best
for sowing.
The plant, persistent in mix-
tures, combines well with
grasses, has a wide range of
adaptation and thrives even
under deficient summer-rain-
fall. It, in fact, does best when
grown in grass-mixtures, and
its habit of fixing nitrogen

greatly improves both quality
a nd quantity of pastures,
especially during winter, when
grasses are largely dormant.
Grown on wheatland as a
rotation green-manure crop it
greatly increases the yield of
grain when the field is cropped
again.
Seed does not ripen evenly,
and as well the pods shatter
badly when mature, scattering
the seed over a considerable
distance. These characteris-
tics make harvesting difficult ;
a large percentage of seed is
lost, and consequently cost of
seed is high. It is hoped that
soon non-shattering varieties
will be propagated.
Overfeeding Pigs
“Acacia”: Many pig-
breeders overfeed their animals
during summer when there's
surplus grain, instead of buy-
ing extra pigs to consume it.
Consequently large numbers of
pigs marketed are too fat, and,
as these realise less than
animals of standard weight,
the farmer loses time, food
and money*
Obvious solutions offer
themselves. Farmers should,
in the first place, try to plan
their breeding-programmes so
that there will be sufficient pigs
of right age on hand to con-
sume any such surplus. If it’s
not possible to breed the extra
pigs, enough weaners should
be bought. Failing this resort,
some of the food-supply
should be stored, with long-
keeping foods stacked to be
used last—a possible valuable
reserve for the leaner winter
months.
Phosphorus
“Kaytee”: During autumn
and winter a sharp drop in the
food-value of native pastures
can be expected, with a lower
level of phosphorus available
to grazing animals. Unless a
suitable supplement is fed,
phosphorus - deficiency may
occur.
The most evident symptom
of this deficiency is depraved
appetite. Affected animals
chew bark, paper and bones ;
their joints may become thick-
ened, bones break easily and
sterility may occur.
The deficiency can be
avoided or corrected by top-
dressing pastures with super-
phosphate, use of phosphatic
licks, or addition of phosphate
to the water-supply. Dairy-
cows should be fed 2oz. bone-
meal a day in the bails, with
an extra ounce a day added
for every gallon of milk pro-
duced.
The method used to correct
the condition in beef-herds
depends on the particular pro-
perty affected. Topdressing
pastures is usually uneconomic,
except on country with a high
carrying-capacity. Addition of
phosphate to the drinking-
water with a mechanical dis-
penser is only practicable
where all the drinking-water
is provided in troughs. Even
the use of licks is not entirely
satisfactory. They are
ful, some cattle don’t like
them, and strong animals often
prevent needy cattle from
getting their requirements.
However, even if all the
cattle don't get their share, at
least most of them will get
enough, which means reduced
incidence of disease.
Vegetable Weevil
“North”: The brown
vegetable - weevil (Listroderes
obliquus ) is a serious potato-
pest. To a lesser degree it also
damages tomatoes, carrots,
turnips and lettuces.
The insect is jin. long and
greyish-brown, with two off-
white patches on its back
forming a distinct V. It has a
long, downward-pointing snout.
Eggs are laid during autumn
and early winter, and, on
hatching, the larvae feed on the
undersurface of leaves. They
hide by day and feed by night,
developing into pale-green
grubs about jin. long, which
pupate in earthern cells in the
ground, until the adult weevils
emerge. These also shelter in
the soil by day and feed by
night on the foliage of the
host-plant, leaving only bare
stems. They attack the bulbs
of carrots and turnips.
To control this pest on pota-
toes, spray or dust with
arsenate -of - lead, but this
method must not be used for
lettuces and tomatoes. D.D.T.
sprayed at 0.1 per cent,
strength, or dusted at 2 per
cent., will soon clean-up
infestation.
A control-measure worth
considering is to cultivate,
fallowing infested land during
winter or early spring to about
2in. below the surface. This
will destroy larvae and
pupae and greatly reduce the
number of weevils emerging
later. Cape-weed is a favorite
host-plant, so all stands grow-
ing near vegetable-fields should
be destroyed.
If weevils are found to be
numerous among weeds grow-
ing close to the cultivation,
spray with arensate-of-lead or
D.D.T.

Is there any stipulation in rules
concerning the Davis Cup as to
the type of surface to be played
on ?
Davis Cup regulation 8 (a) —
revised in 1936—states that the
surface of the court to be used
in the competition shall be either
grass, turf or a natural or artificial
fine gritty material, but in no case
shall a tie be played under cover or
on a surface of wood, stone, con-
crete, asphalt or cement or other
similar substance or composition.

How can false stones be distin-
guished from diamonds ?
Several ways: (a) Wipe the stone
carefully, trace a line on it with
an aluminium-pencil and then rub
briskly with a moist cloth. If the
line remains the stone is false.
ib) A file will not cut a true
diamond but will readily mark an
imitation. (c) A piece of thin
glass on which an edge of the
diamond will cut without much
pressure. (d) If immersed in a
glass of water a diamond will show
its facets clearly, whereas a false
stone loses its sharpness and the
facets are rendered almost indis-
tinguishable.
What was the Sumptuary Law ?
A law made by Edward 111 in
, 1364 whi ,S h forbade persons whose
income did not exceed 400 marks,
yearly to wear garments embroid-
ered with jewellery, while all
persons below the rank of knight-
hood or of less income than £2OO
a year were prohibited from wear-
ing embroidered garments of any
sort. This law fell into disuse
in the next reign, that of Richard
11, but it was revived ip certain
forms b'y Henry VIII.

to forget), others by Ben Hall
and Dunn; there was even a
man who took the name of
Thunderbore [sic].
One girl whom I knew per-
sonally had a curious adven-
ture. She was alone in the
house when she saw some
armed bushrangers approach-
ing. She took cover some
where with a rifle and, as they
came up thinking the house
was empty, shot-down the first
and the second. The rest fled
and she fainted.
One of our cherished family
stories told how our house at
Winderadene was besieged by
bushrangers during my father's
absence in Sydney. My mother
took command, collected such
men as she could get at, barri-
caded the door and put mat-
tresses in the windows. Then
she went out alone, without a
gun, to parley with the leader
of the bushrangers. He wanted
a store of food and beer, which
she agreed to give. Then he
wanted a rifle of my father's,
a repeating rifle which was
highly valued at that time.
This she refused, and, after an
anxious moment, was allowed
to walk back to the house un-
injured. I do not know how
long the siege lasted, but
somehow my uncle William
Edwards, who had been away,
heard of it, and galloped into
Goulburn to get a posse of
mounted police, and so the
siege was lifted.
A nother great family story
told how my father, un-
armed except for an empty gun,
had arrested three armed bush-
rangers. He had arranged to
go to Sydney on a certain day
and at the last moment found
that he was unable to. So two
days later he rode out to give
some instructions to a shepherd
at the far edge of the station
He shot some game on the way*
and arrived at the shepherd’s
hut with his gun empty. The
shepherd seemed surprised and
troubled to see him, and was
not as hospitable as usual.
However, my father stayed,
and while eating he heard foot-
steps outside. Looking through
the window, he saw three men.
The shepherd started up, look-
ing deadly pale. My father
guessed what had happened,
and just had time to cover th.e
door with his empty gun when
the three bushrangers appeared.
He ordered them to drop
their guns, and after a moment’s
hesitation they obeyed. Then
came a question. Was he to
pick up their guns himself and
so be armed? He thought it
better to carry on his bluff, and
and told the shepherd, whom
he could to some extent trust,
to pick up and carry the three
guns. He then marched the
whole party off to a police-
station, I think in Goulburn,
where the three men were
arrested That being done, he
said, he broke into a sweat and
felt very queer.
The commonplace-book con-
firms my own impression of
my father’s general outlook,
He disliked stupidity and ignor-
ance, and hated it when it
became a cause of cruelty,
There are notes about the con-
dition of Irish peasants and of
the inmates of workhouses and
lunatic-asylums; on needless
cruelty to calves and fowls,
and on bad methods of
slaughtering; on the brutalising
effect of capital punishment,
especially upon those who have
to inflict it. There is also a
constant concern for the Aus-
tralian aborigines.
I think he really liked them.
You can see in his journal how
he mixes with them in a free
and friendly way. The elders
of various neighboring tribes
regularly came to him for
advice or help when in difficul-
ties. Once he stopped a fight—-
one cannot call it a war—be-
tween two tribes, but gener-
ally the difficulty was about the
white men. Someone was
shooting them; how had they
offended and what ought they
to do? Some people were
driving them completely off
the land where they had always
lived; must they go into the
desert? Sometimes it was the
terrible and unanswerable
question: “Why did the white
men come here to kill us?”
Once, when my father was
away, and my mother was
in the orchard, a number of
blacks came up and asked for
“sherry.” She did not think
that g6od for them, but did not
like to refuse altogether. After
a little talk she said they might
have some beer, at which they
were highly delighted. It was
I much more than they had ex-
pected; they had really only
asked for “cherries.”
It was found later on that the
blacks believed my father to be
one of their great ancient chiefs
reincarnated as a white man;
hence he understood them and
they obeyed him. Of course
this concern for the blacks did
not play a large part in his
public life or constitute one of
his major interests. But as a
sidelight on character there is
perhaps nothing more reveal-
ing than the way in which a
man deals with those who are
entirely dependent on him and
too weak to pay any adequate
return for care and kindness.
That is-why I lay some stress
on the subject here; and I can-
not refrain from citing a record
(from the “Pacific Islands
Monthly,” May 15, 1940)
which shows how truly the
father’s spirit descended on a
son who had in this matter far
greater power and more in-
timate responsibility:
“The greatest honor that
could be conferred on a white
man by the natives of Papua —
and the only occasion on which
it has occurred in the history
of - the Territory—took place
near Port Moresby on April 8,
when the leading men of the
Motu tribe invited 6000 natives
from neighboring tribes to pay
their last act of homage to the
late Sir Hubert Murray, in a
Tribal Death Feast (Masi
Ariana) ...”

The slightly exalted mood produced
by this success as a sibyl was consider-
ably enhanced, by the nostalgic atmos-
phere, the scent-laden air and the free
gifts of bonbons and French perfume
which characterised the first night of
the Maurice Chevalier season at the
Empire. The audience was predomin-
antly feminine, and all, from the grave
old plodders to the gay young friskers,
were drawn-in by the ever-fresh
Chevalier charm.
There were many young girls in the
audience (the Victor Deky veres were
accompanied by three pretty daughters),
and the dressing varied from the very
glamorous to the very ordinary. Noted
Mrs. Mel Lawton, golden-brown in
cream brocade, and Mrs. Bruce Mac-
Farlan, wearing one of the few full-
length dresses and swathed in fur. As
for the men in the audience —well, most
of them were convinced that life is a
gay thing after all, and some of them
frankly admitted that they’d like to be
7'ly (Chevalier’s age).
When Mrs. Charles Walton (aviatrix
Nancy Bird) gave her interesting talk on
the 1958 All-Women’s Transcontinental
Air-race in the U.S. she received good-
will messages from Dame Mary Gilmore
and Mrs. Florence Taylor. Mrs. Walton
spoke at the luncheon of the Women
Writers’ Society, where the president,
Miss Beryl Guertner, welcomed the mem-
bers, several of whom have had work
published since the society last met.
These included Maisie Greig, who has
had two novels published ; Mrs. Doris
Chesborough, whose play for the series
“The Land and Its People” has been
accepted ; and Mrs. D. Kopsen, whose
book Through the Mirror and Other
Stories has been published in England.
At Sydney Stock Exchange Social
Club's annual cocktail-party, held at the
Yacht Squadron, Kirribilli, on Friday
night, Mr. and Mrs. Beresford O’Connor
introduced the guests to Mr. Alistair
Urquhart, chairman of Sydney ’Change,
and Mrs. Urquhart. It was an animated
party, brokers —and clients —obviously
having had a good year. The women
chatting about their investments, and
what they bought out of the proceeds,
made-up quite a bit of the evening’s con-
versation. Women seem to have spent
their profits more readily than men.
Coralie Rees, whose third book written
in collaboration with her husband , Leslie,
arrived on the bookstalls this week (the
occasion celebrated by a publishing-day
party given for the two of them by
Angus and Robertson s) is a writer whose
travel experience is astonishing for its
variety and arduousness. This latest
book, “Coasts of Cape York,” tells of
six weeks’ intensive travel on Australia’s
topmost peninsula, from Cooktown to
Iron Range (population, one!), by plane
to odd little settlements in the far north,
and through the Torres Strait islands.
Earlier books told of their hitchhiking
through the Kimberleys and Arnhem
Land, and journeys to Cocos Islands,
South Africa, Rhodesia and East Africa.
Coralie has had one volume of poetry
published and has written extensively for
the radio. When she and her husband
are not gallivanting round odd corners
of the earth they live at Neutral Bay
with their two daughters Megan and
Dymphna, both of whom are interested
in writing. "It seems to be the only thing
we Reeses will do, really!” says Mrs.
Rees.
Take a calm starry night, a bushland
garden strung with fairylights, a twinkling
view that extends from the Gib at
Bowral to the lighthouse at Watson’s
Bay and you get some idea of the setting
for the the barbecue given by Colonel
G. E. Colvin, president of the Royal
Commonwealth Society, and Mrs. Colvin
at their French’s Forest home on Satur-
day night.
The party was in aid of the society’s
newly-formed SpeciaL.. Purposes Fund
(this, by the way, is something every
family should have; its aim is to
refurnish the place). Sir William
Durrant, Bart., and Lady Durrant
were present, Mr. and Mrs. Allen
Williams (he undoubtedly the smartest
man at the barbecue with his hounds-
tooth-check coat and his monocle), Mr.
and Mrs. Fred Daniell, Mrs. D. Lindsay,
Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Stevenson and Mrs!
J. Stevenson. Colonel Colvin and John
August were the barbecue-chefs, and
pretty Anne Colvin helped her parents
entertain.

Sir William Oliver, High Commis-
sioner for the U.K., established himself
as a delightfully witty and humorous
speaker with a lightly satiric touch during
his visit with Lady Oliver this week. At
the reception given in his honor by the
Royal Commonwealth Society, the Vic-
toria League and the Overseas League at
David Jones’, he was welcomed by
Colonel G. E. Colvin, Mrs. H. Farncomb
and Major Cecil Chapmaq. Among the
guests were country visitors Mrs. J. B.
Deering, Mrs. J. L. Deering-O’Neill and
Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds (Yass).

Soprano Marilyn Richardson, whose
husband, Peter Richardson, is director of
Musica Nova, shares her husband’s
knowledge of contemporary music and
his enthusiasm for it. Although a busy
housewife with two small boys, Michael
(five) and Christopher (15 months), she
has-found time to gain her diploma from
the Conservatorium and, with her hus-
band, has made a detailed study of the
ornamentation of early music.
At the concert which' Musica Nova
will give on April 2 at the Conserva-
torium in association with the Austral
String Quartet she will sing two groups
of songs by Schoenberg and Webern, and
the programme will also include a flute-
sonata specially written for Peter Richard-

Sydney was glad to welcome back its
Symphony Orchestra conductor Nicolai
Malko and his wife at a party given for
them during the week, when Canadian
singer Lois Marshall and pianist Weldon
Kilburn were also welcomed. As Sir
John and Lady Tivey were celebrating
their golden-wedding anniversary that
day, Mrs. Arnold Hirst and Mr. H.
Finlay received the guests. Everyone
chuckled at Dr: Malko’s definition of a
music-festival given to him by a friend
in Edinburgh: “When you have
rehearsals, it is a concert ; when you
don’t, it’s a festival!”

Masses of mink, much of it white,
occupied the second half of the Renee
Fur Parade which gathered-in funds for
Legacy at the Australia’s Rainbow
Room. Earlier were shown some of the
spotted furs, including ocelot and

Once again Mrs. Charles Davidson
and her helpers on the Your Opportunity
committee have organised the annual
bargain-day in the Lower Town Hall,
and on April 4 there is a chance to pick
up a bargain in the way of a model
gown from a top fashion-designer, a
suit or a frock. All proceeds to go to
the Opportunity Clubs, which do a splen-

Every garment will be modelled, and
the mannequins include Mrs. Leo Guest,
Mrs. Norman Robertson, Mrs. A. G.
Silk, Mrs. Bill McGowan and Mrs.
Hedley Ladd. Comperes will be Mrs.
Leo Curtis and Mrs. Tom Carlyon. New
garments donated by many manufac-
turers will be on sale, and there will
also be stalls at which children’s clothes,
men’s wear, handbags, jewellery and
gramophone-records will be sold. The
sale begins at 10.30 a.m. and finishes at

English by birth, they have spent most
of their lives in Canada, and will return
there at the end of the Commissioner’s
present London appointment. They have
two sons and two daughters. Leaders
of the Salvation Army in Melbourne and
heads of various churches were present,
including Archbishop Woods, Arch-
bishop and Mrs. J. J. Booth, Commis-
sioner G. Sandells and Colonel and Mrs.
A. E. Mingay. Also attending were Mr.

So many sightseers turned-up for the
wedding of former Miss Victoria, Kay
Elaine Nielsen, with well-known foot-
baller Murray Charles Weideman at St.
John’s Church, East Malvern, that some
guests were unable to get into the church.
The bride, who is the eldest daughter of
Mrs. A. Burgess, of Reservoir, wore a
gown of delustred satin with guipure-
lace trimmings on the scooped neckline
and train. A Swan Lake pearl-coronet
held her fingertip veil, and her bouquet
was of white gardenias and carnations.
Kay’s attendants were her sister Beverley
and Mrs. M. Spillard, who wore gowns
of ice-blue delustred satin which featured
back-fullness falling from a bow at the
waistline, and coronets of white blossom
and pearls; they carried bouquets of
white gardenias. The ’groom, youngest
son of Mr. and Mrs. G. Weideman, of
Alphington, had his brother Graeme as
best man; groomsman was James La
Roche. Reception was held at Dennis
House.
When Australian actor George Fairfax
was in London he dropped in to a
theatrical agency, where an English girl,
Joy Webber, was working. Their meeting
began a romance which culminated in
their marriage in Melbourne. Joy, who
is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Cyril
Webber, of Cornwall, had appeared in
England with a water-follies show. She
has made one appearance at Melbourne’s
Little Theatre, where her husband is a
producer. Her daughter, Karen Louise,
was born six months ago.
A pre-winter showing of luxurious furs
was given at the Fur Trade Asso-
ciation’s dinner-party in the Bamboo
Room of the Chevron Hotel. A
striking effect was obtained when to a
white leather coat was added a brown
fox collar. There were also in the exotic
line a little jacket of Arabian kid in
palest grey and a jacket in black-and-
white-spotted kid. American broadtail
was seen in jackets and three-quarter
coats. Paler tones were shown in this
fur: tiara (a creamy shade); ficelle
(more into string-shading); hazelnut (a
warm light-brown); and banker’s-blue
[almost grey). Beaver-lamb was shown
in a trench-coat of golden' beige. One
furrier showed a pullover in beaver
which featured knitted sleeves and collar.
Sealskin was used with good result in
a full-length coat, and Persian-lamb was
seen in all shades of brown. One
Persian-lamb in the new moonstone shade
had a collar of dark ranch-mink. A full-
length belted coat was fashioned of
ocelot, Russian fox in diadem trimmed a
coat in llama cloth. A brown woollen
coat was highlighted with trimmings of
mink; a black-and-white herringbone-
tweed suit had trimmings of black
Persian-lamb.
Peschaniki and watermole, less-expen-
sive furs, were also extensively used.
Parkas were seen with the hood trimmed
with fur. Examples were white parka
with the hood edged With red fox, and a
blue parka with the hood edged with pink
lapin. Newest shades in mink this
season are tourmaline, desert-gold and
kohinoor as changes from the ever-
popular sapphire-blue. Boas were shown
in pink, blue, apricot, mauve and white
Arctic-fox. Also featured in this parade
were fur-hats, the creation of William
Beale.

“Two For The Seesaw,” in which
Diana Perryman and Grant Taylor star,
opened at the Comedy Theatre to an
appreciative audience which for the most
part dispensed with glamorous dressing.
Nevertheless there were several outstand-
ing coats and ensembles. One was the
lovely rose-pink Chinese-brocade coat
worn by Marilyn Cottrell, who was with
her mother, Mrs. Eric Cottrell. Another
stunning coat was that of gold satin worn
by Mrs. Heathcoate Wright. A heavenly-
blue satin stole was worn by Barbara
Spry with a sheath-frock of champagne
guipure-lace. Mrs. D. J. S. Mackinnon s
French re-embroidered laces were pastel-
pink, Mrs. Ross Lieber’s choice was a
short, slim, black-satin skirt topped with
a white organdie blouse which had a
wide cape-collar. Mrs. Norman Spry s
black-taffeta frock had a short, full skirt.

Continuance of mildly warm weather
meant no new fashions at the V.A.T.C.
Caulfield meeting, summer frocks being
preferred. Lady Robinson, who entei-

Easter Saturday for an overseas holiday),
Mrs. J. G. Norris, Mrs. J. Pelly-Fry and

Australian Governments
The Government of the Australian
States, edited by S. R. Davis, Reader
in Political Science at Queensland
University (Longmans), is evidently the
first full (742 pages) and specialised
study of all our State legislatures, each
State covered by a university authority
in or from that State. Although the
main use of the book may be for
reference or as a textbook, its clear
and dispassionate style should appeal
to the general reader.
The man in the street, for instance,
who has heard somewhere that his
State is a sovereign State and that its
legislature can do anything it wants
to do will learn from the study by
H. R. Anderson, of Queensland Uni-
versity, “The Constitutional Frame-
work,” that an Australian State is the
creature of the British Parliament, and
cannot legislate inconsistently with
British law; nor did the Statute of
Westminster affect the position of State
Parliaments in appeals to the Privy
Council; while British law guarantees
the validity of restrictions put by Aus-
tralian State legislatures on changes of
laws by succeeding Parliaments—i.e.,
once a referendum has been stipulated
to decide certain issues, it must always
be taken on those issues in that State.
Mentioning protests against the
gerrymandering of the N. S. Wales
electorate, R. S. Parker, of the National
University, Canberra, says, “If there is
any undue influence on redistribution
no one has yet shown publicly how it
is exercised.”
A. F. Davies, of Melbourne Uni-
versity, makes no suggestion of gerry-
mandering in Victoria, but from his
analysis it is obvious that Victorian
Governments got their effects not by
arranging redistribution but by stalling;
so that, even allowing for the usual
Australian arrangement that country
votes should be of more weight than
city votes, 100 city votes that were
worth 76 country votes in 1888 were
worth only 39 country votes in 1943.
A. A. Morrison, of Queensland
University, after a consideration of the
electoral system which kept Labor in
power for 40 years with only one short
break, can still come to no conclusion:
But despite the evidence of politi-
cal advantages no complete verdict
can yet be delivered on the ethics
of the system, for it still must be
considered in the background of the
State’s needs. The problem of rural
representation has long been a major
issue in Queensland, and it is im-
portant to bear in mind the fact that
preferential treatment for country
electorates is not an invention of the
Labor party.
The trio responsible for the South
Australian study, R. L. Reid of
Adelaide University, L. C. L. Blair of
Durham, and K. A. F. Sainsbury of
Reading, are equally puzzled over the
electoral system that has kept Liberals
in power in South Australia for more
than 20 years:—
It is not as simple as Labor-party
supporters would have one believe.
It is not merely a case of a cynical
and dictatorial Premier flinging
principles to the wind in an effort
to maintain himself in power with
only minority support. It is cer-
tainly not an. example of the classical
gerrymander.
It would be interesting to know if
they meant to say “merely” in the
sentence about the Premier; elsewhere
they portray him as an extraordinarily
shrewd (a few notes on the manage-
ment of Liberal-party meetings in S.A.
'give an excellent insight on what used
to be called “realpolitik”) and capable
friend of the small fanner.
The Melbourne study mentions the
failing influence of the press, whose
last great success was to split the
Liberal party in Melbourne; but in the
editor, S. R. Davis’s, study, “Diversity
in Unity,” press reports of the political
activities of associations and commit-
tees prelude his observation:—
It is plain that the decisions which
governments make in the “public
interest” may be the design of a
private group infinitely smaller in
number than the whole community,
and equally plain that the “interest”
that these few profess to serve may
often be their own rather than any
other.
No less than J. T. Lang is adduced
on lobbyists:—-
On the outer fringe of politics
there have always been the free-
booters who dart in and out of
Ministers’ offices. They trade on
friendship with Ministers. They
brush past Ministerial messengers.
They get to the stage where they can
slap a Minister on the back and call
him “Bill” or “Charlie.” They
always know a good thing for the
races or trots... .Actually they trade
on political influence . . .
A scholarly book, with graphs, maps
and analyses of how they voted, it is
by no means a stuffed-shirt of a book;
it might even be useful to a man who
wanted to slap a Minister on the back
and call him “Charlie.”
THE GANG-GANG
While river browns and beats its stones
And sally-gum shines wet and bronze
Rain pours over the mountain top
And bird looks down and man looks up.
Mans that tall one. wades the water,
Waves a rod and flicks a feather,
A most mysterious thing to do
In the eye of a big grey cockatoo.
Bird is gang-gang, well he knows
His whole head’s feathered like a rose;
If to bob it isn’t enough
He can bite a twig clean off.
Watch and glow or climb and dance,
Never doubt my admiring glance,
But 1 am glad, old cockatoo, -
That I can also interest you,
Man and gang-gang, so we share
A moment’s equal pleasure here;
And wish that I had more to offer
Than what a man is by a river
Before you fly so soon again
Like a wild rose into the rain.

Swimming in the Surf
John Bloomfield’s Know-how in the
Surf (Angus and Robertson) came out
about Christmas-time arid, in “The
Bulletin” office at any rate, got
drowned in the rush; but it should
certainly be resuscitated, for it is a
most interesting piece of work which
would almost appeal to the general
reader simply as a piece of writing
about the surf; which would be of
value to all who swim in the sea and
could save the lives of many of those
who, every Sunday, try to perish
in it; and which is practically com-
pulsory reading (with a foreword by
Adrian Curlewis) for members and
intending members of lifesaving
clubs.
True, much of it is familiar. C. Bede
Maxwell has told us all about Black
Sunday at Bondi and other great feats
of life-saving. We all know, surely,
the story of the intrepid Mr. Gocher
who plunged into the waters of Manly
in full daylight in 1902 and so started
more than he could have imagined;
and if we have forgotten that it was
Tommy Tanna, the gardener’s boy
from Manly, who first showed us how
the South Sea islanders rode the waves,

we shouldn’t have. W. J. Dakin, T. C.
Roughley and others have told us all
about sharks, bluebottles and sea-
wasps.
Still, there is a certain advantage m
having all this sort of lore gathered in
an appropriate place —in a book about
swimming —and, as far as the beasts
that bite you are concerned, they have
such a gruesome fascination that the
most familiar facts can always be read
again:—
The fatal sea-wasp is of a color
resembling that of boiled starch,
with a box-shaped bell about six-
inches square. There are numerous
tentacles.... .up to six-feet in length.
The sting of the sea-wasp should be
treated immediately as for snakebite.
However, the freshest interest of the
book, both for reading and for the
swimmer, is the information about how
the experts ride the waves, diving down
to the bottom and grabbing the sand
if need be to cope with a dumper or,
bored with ordinary surfing, practising
such elegant refinements as the cork-
screw, the double corkscrew and the
left-and-right spinner; and its most
important sections are those specifi-
cally for life-savers, under such head-
ings as “The Surf Carnival,” “Train-
ing for Competitive Surfing,” etc. The
author was formerly an Australian
surf-champion and is now sports-master
at an N. S. Wales high school.
So, with a brief shudder at the title,
that is “Know-how in the Surf”; a little
belatedly, but done with all the know-
how in reviewing, little enough as it
may be, at this reviewer’s command.
The Digger
John Laffin’s Digger, The Story of
the Australian Soldier (Cafssell), is a
racy survey of the tradition which, he
says, began with the Boer War in 1900.
Probably the best Digger picture one
has ever seen is the photograph,
“Bayonet charge at Anzac,” opposite
page 21: a small group running across
rocky ground with a few shrubs, one
in breeches, no puttees, his hat-brim
turned down all round, the crown
pushed right up; one in shorts and
puttees, his hat correctly cocked and
dented; one in long trousers, an
unbuttoned tunic, wearing his hat like
an American rancher’s; one in cap,
singlet and shorts ; one in kepi, shorts,
and white socks turned down over the
ankles ; but all raising expertly, if at
varying angles, against the skyline the
long, thin bayonets —it is easy to see
how, for the British generals, the
Australians added dishabille to the
horrors of war:—
The Diggers nonplussed Allenby
more than once. He was inspecting
their lines —I believe near Gaza—
and came upon a half-stripped light-
horseman seated outside his tent
delousing his shirt. The Digger
glanced at him, but didn’t bother to
stand up and went on with his work.
Allenby, conscious that some re-
mark was called for, said, “Ah, pick-
ing them out, soldier?”
“Nope,” the Digger said, without
looking up, “just taking them as they
come.”
It is a long way from the picture of
the Anzac charge to the World War
II picture: “They’ll follow a good
leader anywhere. Bayonet attack,
Middle East,” opposite page 85 ; a
superbly-balanced shot of an officer in
shorts, shirt and tin-hat moving at the
crouch with his revolver into clouds of
smoke, followed by men similarly clad,
with bayonets. Public Relations, you
might feel, had caught-up with the
tradition until you turned to the New
Guinea pictures opposite pages 180
and 181, of Australian wounded walk-
ing back through the New Guinea
jungle. Ragged and casual both in
danger and in adversity, that is the
point, much and rightly as authority
may regret it, at which the light of
glory has marked them out.
And it is in this way that Laffin has
written about them: wrecked battalions
refusing to disband and merge with
other battalions after Mt. St. Quentin,
naked troops digging wells in Palestine
for 24-hour shifts, on the one hand;
and on the other hand souveniring a
French General’s kepi at the armistice
with the Vichy French at Acre, manu-
facturing Japanese battle-flags for sale
to the Yanks, capable of brilliant ruses
to walk-off with jars of rum under the
noses of English military police.
Attempts were made to cope with
them, none more curious, or more new
to the present reviewer, than Laffin’s
account of the Clean Lip Brigade:—
During the Great War swearing
worried some padres so much that
one of them established the Clean
Lip Brigade ; every member of this
remarkable unit was supposed to
count ten whenever he felt like
swearing and his comrades were
urged to pray for him. It was a great
chance for the Army to issue medals
for particularly valorous clean lips,
but nothing was done.
These remarks should not give the
impression that Laffin, a product of
Duntroon, who served five years with
the A.1.F., is an admirer of picturesque
indiscipline. He has visited every
country where Australians have fought,
and his chapters cover Australians in
action in the Boer War, World War I
and World War 11, their generals, their
V.C’s., some of their great battles, their
slang, their songs, their cemeteries, etc.
It is a scattered performance, much of
it familiar to Australians, some of it
out of o’her books, not directed to any
particular target, but, maybe because
of that, easy on the eye of the casual
reader.
Reviewed Briefly
David Boyle’s With Ardours Mani-
fold (Hutchinson) is a conventional
autobiography of an interesting and
unusual life. A Gold Stick at three
coronations and also on duty in 1953
for the curious service of the Honors
of Scotland, the author spent his life
in China, Ceylon, Persia and South-
east Asia, on the Gold Coast (now
Ghana), in the U.S. and Ireland, and
was a King’s Messenger during War
11. But he spoils his tale by the way
he tells it—constant use of the stilted
“one” and too much recourse to
Christian names of acquaintances who
have reached any degree of note.

Vicky’s World: A bright collection
of Vicky’s cartoons from the London
“Daily Mirror,” “New Statesman” and
“Evening Standard” —none brighter
than the picture of Stalin in his recent
decline got-up as Napoleon in “The
Retreat From Moscow.” But, if this in
its stiff-paper binding represents a new
economy-trend in publishing, the pub-
lishers (Seeker and Warburg) will
surely have to find some format that
doesn’t make the books look so much
like school textbooks.

Amidst advice on how to address your

there is the harrowing information that
it is possible to launch a deb. expen-
sively for £8125 or cheaply for £7l3 —
you’d think the girl was a battleship.

Fishing and Thinking: A. A. Luce,
M.C., Litt. D.. D.D. (Hodder and
Stoughton). This is English and Scot-
tish fishing, and the Australian angler
is not as yet (who knows what will
come to pass on the Snowy dams?)
likely to see “On a warm July after-
noon, when the sun is behind the boat
....great plump trouts swimming
lazily after your flies with the dignity
of aldermen fed on turtle-soup.” But
many of the problems—“rising short,”
for instance —are. of course, the same;
and it makes a very pleasant book of
mingled reminiscence and expertise.
