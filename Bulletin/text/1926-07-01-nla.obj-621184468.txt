The Red Page
Why Authors Leave Home
As an ever hopeful investor in Aus-
tralian printed matter, I say that the
chief trouble with Australian writers is
inability to write. There is a wide discrep-
ancy between the efforts of Australian fiction-
writers and the high standard of Australian
achievement in other fields of endeavor,
Recent Red Page articles fix the blame for
the sad plight of our writers on the foreign
trash that inundates our bookstalls. Perhaps
some blame is attaching there, but it seems
to have escaped recollection that there is an
Australian all-fiction magazine devoted to
trash which holds its own with imported
stuff of like quality. (It has survived half
a century and its advertising department
claims a net circulation of 20,000.) It is
the journal of literary pretensions which
makes heavy weather of it. (In the Lone
Hand in its palmiest days fiction was much
the weakest department.)
The Australian writer has a chance to
show his metal in the weekly story which
is featured by some Australian journals. In
all cases the quality of the story is noticeably
lower than that of the other contents.
Readers are legion who “read everything
except the story.” It is not that readers
dislike fiction with an Australian locale,, but
long experience has taught them that the
mill-run of Australian stories does not repay
the effort of perusal. The Australian reader
who is even moderately discriminating is
compelled to go beyond Australian writers
'«) find a readable tale. He cannot be ex-
pected to follow the unconvincing adventures,
of unreal characters merely because the'
writer has. inserted Australian place-names
into the story.
There is an aspect other than that of
literary power. It is the matter of choice
of theme. Australian tales, especially those
with a glimmer of literary skill, tend to
the morbid. Australians are not morbid,
they are robust. They are tired of
the tale that trips blithely beside the
reader, and then, in the last three sentences,
trips him up—-so that he falls into a Gob
of Gloom from which he must extricate him-
self as best he can. They are tired of that
Gob of Gloom, that Dagger Thrust of Fate,
that Stark Realism—that isn’t. Tired of
tales that begin in the bar and finish in the
gutter! Beer, whiskers and lost jobs! The
Eternal Tragedy lies before us all, but mean-
while we have Life —why not write of it?
The question of price may have some bear-
ing on the matter, but not as much as our
writers would lead us, to believe. With one
exception the better foreign publications are
sold at a higher price than local productions.
Some retail for as much as a shilling, others
tenpen.ee. Readers prefer to pay the higher
price. The stories are good. The one ex-
ception is the Saturday Evening Post, and
in this case our writers tell us they are de-
feated by sheer bulk-for-the-money. As a
reader of Australian periodicals and the
Saturday Evening Post, I venture the
opinion that an Australian publication of the
same type, one quarter the size (say 64
pages), the same price, ‘ and equally well
written, would chase the Yankee back to
his own country—but Lord help the editor
who had to select his copy from the present
run of local writing!
Story-writing is arduous. Here it is
poorly paid. Perceiving this, minds well
equipped for literary expression are deflected
into better rewarded channels of efforts
Whether Protection, sufficient to raise writ-
ing in Australia to the level of a well-paid
profession, would result in the much-needed
improvement in our literary output is, of
course, another question.
F.D. DAVISON.
Music’s Metier
Many eminent musicians find their highest
pleasure in listening to “pure” music—music
unassociated with any other art. They do
not desire that any indicative titular words
be tagged to a composition. Verbal sugges-
tion or explanation, they'say, belittles a
work. The lead given to the imagination by
suggestion divides their attention, and beau-
tiful tone combinations that would otherwise
be enjoyed are passed unobserved. They do
not want to mentally visualise material
scenes, being content to confine their
pleasure to the enjoyment of sounds. Suffici-
ent is it for them to listen to melodious
undulations, rich harmonies, smooth and
grammatical progressions and modulations,
suave nuances,-and the intricate interweav-
ings of the polyphonic web.
Amongst other musicians are those who
think that music is a language. Dr. Walford
Davies has said that “music is a language of
the mind. As a cathedral is a thought made
visible, so a sonata can be a, thought made
audible.” To claim that music is “a language
of the mind” secures nothing specially in
music’s favor, for it would be difficult to
discover any language that is not one. of the
mind. Moreover, it can be demonstrated
that music is not a language. As to. the
comparison of a cathedral with a sonata, the
association seems remote. The purport of a
cathedral is palpable—its meaning is .simi-
larly interpreted by all normal observers.
The purport of a sonata is impalpable—its
meaning cannot be pictured without the aid
of language. Failing this aid it will have
a thousand meanings thrust upon it by a
thousand hearers. For a second thousand it
will have no meaning. This second class of
music-mind seems bent on struggling to give
form to fog. It yearns to define the in-
definite.
The desire to “interpret” music seems
almost an obsession with many. At times
they go so far as to “explain” a work with-
out the knowledge or consent of its composer.
The case of Rachmaninoff’s Prelude in C
Sharp Minor is one in point. The composer
thus writes: “There has been an idea that
the Prelude represents the cries of* a man
being buried alive. That is erroneous. It
was the spontaneous creation of my own
brain without any particular preconceived
idea. It was one of those mental achieve-
ments produced without any direct guiding
idea.” Rachmaninoff's work is by no means
singular in having been so dealt with. The
ardent “languageists” project on to a work
a meaning conjured by their imagination, and
then claim that the work self-expresses the
meaning they have thrust upon it.
There is another class of music-mind to
which music without words makes little
appeal. Those belonging to this class have
varied preferences, according to their en-
vironment. In Italy grand opera is their
staple musical food, to the English people it
is but. a horts-d'trnvre. To the English the
oratorio and similar forms having a religioso
color are a constant attraction. They sit in
glad gioom through a performance of “The
Messiah” at Christmas, and listen to Bach
at Easter. For the rest of the year they
are not averse to the religioso color over-
flowing from such works and entering their
sopgs. The music of these last must be of
camouflaged hymn character, and the words
sombre, with a tinge now and then of pessi-
mism.
Then the ballade amoureuse (I use French
because “love song” does not carry my sug-
gestion) has great vogue. It is often maud-
lin, mostly healthy, and frequently virile.
It has been said that he who writes the words
writes the song; certainly the song that
lives longest reaches beyond the average
standard of merit in. the words. Just at
present an evolutionary change seems com-
ing over the song-form, the result no doubt
of the easier rapprochement of the sexes
brought about by the pale paganism of the
time. Unfortunately, this modification has
resulted in offshoots in the shape of jazz
barbarities and imitations - of noxious negro
noises. These latter are at base merely
erotic frenzies—artistically and morally
toxic.
The potentialities of music for good or ill
can be but named here. The art is a “Pro-
teus with a face for everybody.” It can be
made an embroidered veil to soften outlines.
It will sway the tide of battle, or croon a
child to sleep. It is a devotional aid in holy
places, and a dope in the vaults of vice. It
holds both delight and danger. It is mis-
understood, on the one hand, by those who
would thrust on to it attributes not inherent
in it —such as explanatory or educational
powers, or hyper-mystic qualities. On the
other hand, it is misused bj>- those who drag
it down to the servitude of sensuous de-
generacy. To the great normal majority we
must look to keep cults in their corners and
preserve for us an untarnished “concord of
sweet sounds” that shall yield us pure pleas-
ure—the giving of which is music’s metier.

Tennyson in Transit
What do we think of Tennyson? In his
lately-published book, Tennyson, a Study,
Harold Nicholson says that he asked several
of his friends the question. The reply in
the majority of cases was, “I don’t think of
him at all.” Seldom, if ever, in our his-
tory has there been such a slump in a literary
reputation. The reasons are interesting, be-
cause they point to a totally changed out-
look —social, philosophical and religious—in
the course of a generation. Tennyson was
regarded up to 30 years ago not only as a
very great poet, but as a profound and pro-
phetic thinker —a man who was inspired to
utter, and constantly did utter, great truths
about life and faith and immortality. This
may not have been the view of an obstinate
(and more or less suspect) minority; but it
was the view of all that respectable and
moderately well-read class that elects to be
known as right-thinking. When the Victorian
age read in Lady Clara Vere de Vere
Howe’er it be, it seems to me
’Tis only noble to be good,
it felt that an ethical truth hud been stabil-
ised for all time. If it found strict ortho-
doxy a little difficult, it was immensely con-
soled to have the prophet’s assurance that
“there is more faith in honest doubt, believe
me, than in half the creeds.” It believed
with Stopford Brooke that faith in immortal
life would not be seriously shaken, for the
sufficient reason that Tennyson was there in
the breach to defend it.
What has happened? There have been
outward changes, of course; but the real
change has been below the surface. It is a
change that has had nothing to do with
developments of steam and electricity. Tenny-
son remained on his pedestal for years after
the stage-coach had gone and the Atlantic
had been spanned by the electric cable. His
fall, since his death in 1892, has been solely
due to the movement of currents under-
ground. Unless we look back at him as he
was, and notice how far he has drifted —•
with the pedestal vanished and only the
head showing above water—we should hardly
be able to gauge the carrying power of the
stream.
According to Nicholson, the nineteenth
century first accepted and then idolised
Tennyson because it was tired of the forces
of unrest. It wanted a man who would not
try to unsettle things. Byron and Shelley,
and their crowd of imitators and satellites,
had been doing that. The peace-at-any-price
inclination had been accentuated by the
growth of commercialism and by the fear
that these writing fellows would cause as
much trouble as they had done in France.
Then came the Queen and the Queen’s ,hus-
band and the attitude of both to morals —
an attitude adopted or counterfeited by all
circles and coteries that had anything to
hope from the Court. The result is known.
A man who could extol domesticity in really
impressive verse was a godsend. Tennyson
could do it better than anyone had done it
before. It was his environment that made
him for his generation—just as it marred
him for ours. At- first he was a sensitive
and rather diffident young fellow, not at all
inclined to give himself airs. A tinge of
effeminacy was born with him, but there
was rugged strength as well. The effeminacy
was fostered by the sheltered life of the rec-
tory. His clergyman father died when the
son was still a boy; but a religious mother

Hudson’s position as the world’s greatest value is not merely a
new attainment. For ten years the Super-Six has stood alone in
mechanical supremacy. Basic patents have kept others from
copying its motor. The smoothness and long life it gives are
exclusive. No motor has yet equalled the Super-Six in smooth-
ness and long, economical life.
Because of its simplicity, the Super-Six has always enjoyed
manufacturing advantages that permit a lower selling price than
is possible with more complicated types.
In ten years of value leadership, its performance, quality and
price advantage have never been so out-
standing as to-day.
The Coach has long been acknowledged the
“World’s Greatest Buy,’’ because of its
utility, performance and value. Now among
luxurious cars, the beautiful Brougham and
the Sedan give Hudson the same unrivalled
position among luxurious cars. They have
all the distinction of the finest custom-built
cars, with a price advantage based on the
world s largest production of 6-cylinder cars.

and four worshipping sisters helped to keep
the rough winds away. . .
A too-admiring circle of friends,, formed
at Cambridge and continued later, convinced
the young man that he was a child of Selling-
A volume of early poems, published in 18.»0,
was more than respectfully received. In
1833 came another and better volume—it
contained such pieces as “The Lotos Eaters
and “The Dream of Fair Women”— but here
an unexpected check occurred. Borne of the
big men of the reviews laughed at what one
of them called the Baa Lamb School. Lock-
hart. in the Quarterly Review, made mock
of the prettyisms of certain lines. The
author winced, like a startled horse and
published nothing more for another 10 years'.
But in those 10 years the desire for sooth-
ing sentiments had been growing. A\ hen the
poet again came into the open, this time with
a volume that included “Locksley Hall and
“Morte d’Arthur,” the ground was thoroughly
well prepared. In 1850 appeared "In
Memoriam,” and the prophet was well on his
pedestal, from which he was not destined to
be shifted for the remaining 42 years of his
life. The more people gazed at the figure
becoming more rapt and symbolic as the
years went on—the more they admired it.
“At last.” they said, “we have a man of
genius who isn’t immoral, and whose books
you can give a boy or girl to read.”
The reaction against Tennyson has gone
far. Nicholson thinks it has reached the
limit, and that there will be a swing back.
That may be, or it may not. Actually the
reaction has been less against the poetry than
away from the pseudo-philosophical part of
it. No one who cares anything for the music
of ■words, or the colorful play of ideas, would
assert that poems like “Ulysses.” “Tithonus”
or “The Lotos Eaters” (to mention only
these) have been overpraised. There arc no
arbitrary standards in matters of this kind.
The queer thing, the amazing thing, is the
changed attitude of the public—its utter in-
difference to the problems Tennyson worried
over, and that his contemporaries thought he
had solved. We no longer want to read
about faith or doubt or domesticity. That
a generation so near to ours should exalt him
for his writings on these subjects seems more
extraordinary still. Looking back at that
generation, and judging it by its chief liter-
ary idol, we say we are less easily satisfied
because we are more honest with ourselves.
Shibboleths have no longer a hold over us;
in speculative things we have left the age
that hero-worshipped Tennyson a thousand
years behind. We may be no nearer the
truth, and further from individual happiness,
than they were; but at least we are not so
easily self-deceived.
A. J. B.
Plain Talk from Maynooth
Dr. McDonald, son of an Irish farmer, and
for 30 years Professor at Maynooth, left at
his death a volume of reminiscences
(Reminiscences of a Maynooth Professor, by
Walter McDonald, D.D., Prefect of the Dun-
boyne Establishment, 1888-1920. Edited by
Denis Gwynn; published by Jonathan Cape).
It is not well put together. At times it is
too diffuse. Nevertheless it is instructive.
Dr. McDonald was a courageous, outspoken
priest, without an atom of prudence or diplo-
macy in his composition. He said exactly
what he thought, with a confidence, and at
times a pugnacity, which is more entertain-
ing than convincing. He propounded certain
propositions which further reflection con-
strained him to revise. Others he held with
invincible tenacity. Intellectually he was
far in advance of many of the Irish R.C.
authorities, was frequently in collision with
his superiors, and generally an object of sus-
picion.
His earliest published volume, which was
a speculative discussion on the relation of
grace to human activity, dissatisfied and
alarmed the Irish bishops, who advised him
to submit it to the final judgment of the
Holy See, with the result that it was at
once placed upon the Index of prohibited
writings. The decree of condemnation was not
made public partly to avoid injuring the re-
putation of Maynooth. It was only com-
municated privately to the author through
the Irish bishops. Inquiry for precise infor-
mation as to what it was that had been con-
demned elicited the reply that there were “no
propositions directly opposed to revealed
doctrines,” but that he transferred a scien-
tific theory to matters theological and reli-
gious, which cannot be done without danger.
The author understood this to mean that it
was a question of philosophy. On this ex-
perience the author gives his reflections :
The fact is, or seems to be, that the old, loyal
system of church government disappeared long since,
and that we are ruled by way of secret inquiries,
conducted, no doubt, by good men, who are animated
with the very best intentions. We have got so much
into the habit of Miese secret investigations that we
look on public discussion as an evil; for no other'
reason apparently than because it is not secret, or
because perhaps it gives too much information to
the public, and enables others besides ourselves to
judge. I have, 1 hope, carried out faithfully the
instructions which I received on this occasion from
the bishops, as I loyally obeyed afterwards the
decision of the Holy See; but while recognising and
deferring to authority, 1 have my own opinion as to
the wisdom of its- proceedings; and 1 say that no
science could flourish if its professors were to be
haled at once before some tribunal for every new
opinion they may propound, and if the learned world
is not allowed to discuss any new opinion which
fails to commend itself to a couple of third-rate
exponents of the science in question.
It is odd to read that the Irish bishops,
directing what journals should be allowed to
the students of Maynooth, admitted the
Saturday Review, but not the Tablet nor
the weekly edition of the Times. These same
bishops are represented as under constant fear
of criticism from Rome, and sometimes in-
cited to take action against their own priests,
which they were reluctant to do. It is clear
that in Ireland, as’ elsewhere, the student
and administrator are unable to appreciate
or understand one another. And here the
student's contempt for the busy organisers
who had no time for reflection is ill con-
cealed.
The professor of dogmatic theology at
Maynooth vexed his soul exceedingly over
the belated text-books in use, over the value
attached to the syllogistic method, and over
the retention of Latin as the language in
which lectures had to be. delivered. Hesean-
dalised the conservative-minded Irish bishops
by what they regarded as the daring and
reckless freedom of his criticism on the
Roman method: “Think what you might ex-
pect from a medical school in Dublin which
taught medicine in French or German.”
“Why not, it has often been said, make Latin
our own, as was done in the Middle Ages
and is still done in Rome? The answer is
We are not in the Middle Ages, not even in
Rome. Do as we may ever hope to do, the
language of our daily life will be the ver-
nacular, wherein wc do our thinking, especi-
ally when called on to deal with abstruse
and difficult things, such as must occupy us
in Philosophy and Theology. Latin is
a dead language, even to those who speak
it best and most, even in Rome.” The Irish
bishops reproved the Professor for these un-
favorable criticisms.
He even ventured the highly independent
remark that laws were better observed when
subjects became free to criticise them.
“What!” exclaimed a horrified bishop,
"Would yon criticise Propaganda?” “Yes,”
replied the Professor, “and greater than
Propaganda. There would be ever so much
less for history to record with shame and
tears if there had been more criticism, rever-
ent but fearless, of those who occupied high
places, even in the Church, in the past.”
AYliat must strike an ordinary reader,
Catholic or otherwise, is the timidity of the
R.C. Episcopate in Ireland, the natural
result* it is suggested, of being compelled to
get permission every five years from Rome
to exercise their episcopal rights in their
dioceses. No wonder this professor was an
enfant terrible in such an atmosphere! In-
deed in politics he went to extremes. His
sympathies with the Irish Nationalists were
keen. At one time he approved of boycotting
and cattle driving. His address to the bishops
on the right of resistance to landlords and
to English oppressors left nothing to be de-
sired for plain speaking. A prophet' with
inflammatory utterances in the midst of pru-
dent superiors, an outspoken independent in
the midst of diplomatic authorities, could
hardly expect to have an easy time. It is
probably well for the author that the book
was not published while he lived. But Catholics
and non-Catholics alike will probably close it
with the reflection that if it is possible to
have too little authority in a church, it is
equally possible to have too much.
A. H. G.
Kipling as a Punster
Those who have not forgotten “The Bing
Boys” will recall that tuneful number “The
Kipling Walk." An examination of Kipling’s
verse proves that “On his walk he madly
puns.”
Certainly Kipling is not such an inveterate
punster as W. S. Gilbert or Tom Hood. In
“Departmental Ditties” there are only two
examples of what could bo called puns. lie
wrote this book, which, as lie said, was “a
child's child,” in his early twenties. One
would have expected puns to be more plenti-
ful here than in his more mature poems,
especially as most of the “Ditties” were
humorous newspaper verses. The first is
really more a parody than a pun, and makes
a play upon “The Rubaiyat of Omar Khay’-
yam” in the title of a set of verses, “The
Rupaiyat of Omar Kal’vin.” It deals with
Calvin’s troubles in handling the rupees
of the Indian Budget. The other pun is
a‘ tobacchanalian one, “The Great God Nick
o’Teen,” which occurs in “The Betrothed.”
These verses contain the famous line. .
And a woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is
a smoke.
A quartette of puns is to be found in “The
Three-Decker”: —
Bv ways no gaze could follow, a course unspoiled
of cook,
Per Fancy, fleetest in man, our titled berths w-.
took.
“Gaze” and “cook” refer to the two well-
known tourist agencies of those names:
“course” has the double meaning of a course
at a meal and the course followed by a ship ;
while “in man” is a reference to the Inman
line of steamers.
A most ingenious trio of puns is concealed
in “The Rhyme of the Three Captains.”
“This ballad,” says its introduction, "ap-
pears to refer to one of the exploits of the
notorious Paul Jones, an American pirate.
It is founded on fact.” It is a parable in
verse in which Kipling gives utterance to his
feelings about what he regarded as the piracy
of some of his work by an American pub-
lisher. The “three great captains” to whom
the poet appeals for .justice are Sir Walter
Besant, Thomas Hardy and William Black
—and here are the puns on their names: —
We are paid in the coin of the white man’s trade —
the bezant is hard, ay. and black.
Sir Walter Besant is thus described: —
And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse
to Blackwall,
And he was Chaplain of the Fleet —the bravest oi
them all.
(One of Besant’s best-known novels was
“The Chaplain of the Fleet.”) Thomas
Hardy appears as “Lord of the Wessex coast
and all the lands thereby,” and William
Black as “Admiral of the North, from Sol-
way Firth to Skye.”
In “The Files” there is one lonely little
pun: “In our nettw/mPdre-la-Chaiso the
office files.” P&re-la-Chaise is, of course,
the famous Paris cemetery.
“Pan in Vermont” discloses a pun in
“Greekly speech," giving the name of the
world-old firm to which Pan, the spring
seedsman, belongs : ,
His house is Gee and Tellus’ Sons —so goes his jest
with men.
“Ge” and “Tellus” are the Greek and Latin
names for the earth.
As might be expected, there are several
puns in “Verses on Games," which Kipling
wrote for the “Almanac of Twelve Sports,”
by William Nicholson, published in IS9S.
For instance: —
JANUARY (Hunting).
Ccries, it is a noble sport
And men have quitted selle and swum for ’t.
But I am of the meeker sort
And I prefer Surtees in comfort.
R. B-. Surtees was the author of a dum-
ber of sporting novels in which Kipling,
despite the fact that both his grandfathers
were Methodist preachers, has delighted ever
since his schooldays.
JUNK (Cricket).
Give me a willow wand and 1
Wiih hide and cork and twine
From century to century
Will gambol round my shrine!
OCTOBER (Golf).
Why Golf is art and art is Golf
We have not far to seek —
So much depends upon the lie,
So much upon the deck.
DECEMBER (Skating).
Over the ice she flies
Perfect and poised and fair,
Stars in my true-love’s eyes
Teach me to do and dare.
Now will I fly as she flies— .
Woe for the stars that misled,
Stars I beheld in her eyes,
Now do I see in my head !
There is a play upon words in the couplet
“A Grave Near Cairo,” from “Epitaphs of
the War,” which runs as follows: —
Gods of the Nile, should this stout fellow here
Get out —get out! He knows not shame nor fear.
Probably he was an Australian.
In “Tommy” the line w 7 ill be found : “We'll
wait; for extra rations if you treat us
rational .” And in “Gunga Din”: “You
1 jti/arHshian-lea thcr, Gunga Din 1” Coin-
ages, rather than puns, are some of the
epithets applied to the Royal Marines in
“Soldier an’ Sailor Too,” e.g., “harumfro-
dite.” “eosmopolouse” and “procrastitutes.”
“The Ballad of the ‘Clamperdown,’ ” contains
a pun on the name of the battleship Cam-
per down.
Here are further samples :
When by the labor of my ’ands
I’ve ’elped to pack a transport tight
With prisoners for foreign lands,
I ain’t transported with delight.
, — Half-0 all ad of Waterval.
Canst thou number the days that we fulfil,
Or the Times that we bring forth?
The Press.
The Camel’s hump ir. an ugly lump
Which well you may see at the Zoo;
But uglier yet is the hump we get
From having too little 1 to do.
— Just-So Stories.
She had danced till the dawn of that terrible day—
She danced on till dusk of more terrible night,
And before her linked squares his battalions gave way
And her long fierce quadrilles put his lancers to
flight.
\ -—Brown B ess.
“Will you draw the weight,” sez ’e, “or will you
draw the beer?”
—The Jacket.
Space does not permit of a collection of
the ■ puns in Kipling’s prose works. Per-
haps the cheeriest of them is the angry
colonel’s reference in “My Sunday at Home”
to “Helen Blazes —-an old flame of his.”

A Satchel of Books
Vanishing Trails, by Harrison Dale (Angus and
Robertson). Without covering any new ground the
author succeeds in investing scenes and places familiar
to the traveller with something of his own per-
sonality and his individual outlook. It serves well
its dedicated purpose •of bringing in light and
picturesque fashion something of sunlit travel to
the untravelled.
Fugleman the Foxhound, by Harding Cox (John
Lane). Morgan Woodd held that dogs have souls,
and professed that by the exercise of a sixth sense
lie could talk with them, and in a less perfect degree
with horses, cats and other animals. This book
is the autobiography of a foxhound conveyed through
the medium of this process. The conception is novel,
the story has an interest, but the dialogue is hope-
lessly stilted.
First, Essays on Advertising , by J. Murray Allison
(Cecil Palmer). Modern advertising he defines as
“a method of attaining mass production by creating
h goodwill, thus reducing the cost of manufacture
and of distribution ; in the final phase it is a method
of lowering the price at which goods are sold to the
public.” There is imported into Britain merchandise,
finished or practically so, and ready for sale, to the
value of £300,000,000 annually. This merchandise,
inferior in quality, is offered at prices with which
the British, producer can’t compete. It is suggested,
therefore, that a Federation of British Industries
should be formed to finance an advertising cam-
paign; and the book goes on to discuss details.
Architecture (“Art in Australia”). The May
number contains an article on zoning which has a
more than technical interest. Zoning laws have been
passed in New York and Chicago, the two great
centres of skyscraper buildings. The law of zoning
means that a pyramid must be superimposed on a
cube. The idea was to mitigate the unsightliness
of the elongated box-like structures that were domi-
nating these cities by their soaring masses. In
N.Y. a structure is now allowed to rise straight
up from the street line only, to a height determined
by the width of the street upon which it faces.
If carried beyond that height it must from that
point onward slant backward and be kept within
a line drawn from the centre of the street through
the top of the wall on the street or building line.
This determines the pyramidal shape; but as a
pyramid is unsuited for windows, the architects have
designed a series of “set-backs” or terraces that as
they step backwards and upwards are still kept
within the pyramidal line. The effect of this zoning
principle, in well-designed set-back architecture, is
shown by some illustrations to be as near the pictur-
esque as mass building of its kind can be made.
“S.T.S.”: The tribute of “E.H.” (R.P. 3/6/’2,6)
to the work of Kathleen Watson is no more than she
merited. “Litanies of Life” remains quite her best;
but it was too delicate a fabric for real popularity,
also it was crowded with a resolute gloom, an almost
intolerable pathos. Still, it remains one of Australia’s
best dozen works of fiction. The episode of the
child by its father’s statue is unforgettable.
“J.L.E.”: I have just returned from England and
the advice given me by well-wishers was to “cut
out that Australian stuff.” An Australian who is
doing well in Fleet-street told me that when he first
began in England he tried to use his native back-
ground, but editors persisted in wanting to know why
the deuce he kept pushing in his d —d Australians
and observed that if he “must have an Australian in
an otherwise decent yarn, better make him the
villain.” He dropped his own people to his great
advantage. I thought that the war might have altered
this, but find that such is not the case. I said to
some English friends one night when talking of
Australian books, “You know you don’t really care
a hang about Australia.” To which the answer was,
in an apologetic tone, “Well, no, I suppose we don’t.”
I repeated this to a Melbourne publisher who was
born in Scotland. “No, I don’t suppose they do,” he
replied; “but why should they?” For my part
my next novel will have neither Australian scenes nor
characters. I agree that what we lack is plot.

The Child and the Flowers.
Oft I have seen when all the world is fair
And flowery fields are brushed by breezes
mild,
Walking among the stems some wonder-
ing child,
Laughing with joy, the wind beneath her
hair;
And I have watched her hands, eager and
bare,
Pull madly where the starry wreaths were
piled,
As though she meant to pluck the very
wild
And hold unto her heart each blossom there.
I am that child in Life’s long summer day,
Drunk with the wine of earth and sky and
sun, '
Snatching each joy with hands uncomforted,
t or fear that I may leave a single one—
Forgetful that the bounteous years will
spread
Still more and more along the lovely way!

The Fruit-stall.
Between the shadows of the drooping leaves
Stark sunlight throws its silver in the
street;
And where cool ways and paths unshaded
meet • ,
The fruit-stall stands, beneath its canyased
eaves,
Yielding its feasts of color to the sight.
Massed heaps of gold, soft greens and
purples cool,
Amber like glows of sunset in a pool,
They whisper to the senses of delight,
Of orchards spreading over slopes lush-
green
Where day sleeps on in peacefulness
serene.
Within my ears the singing of a stream
Sounds softly in its babbling here and
there;
The drone of bees, the music for a dream
Of sweet contentment, whispers in an air
That in its lazy playing shakes the trees
And, stealing scented sweetness as it goes,
To right and left the plundered largesse
throws.
Here am I sprawled a moment at my ease,
Watching the little drowsy clouds that
float
Across the sky, each one a fairy boat.
Now in the cool of silvery surf I splash,
Where glass-clear waves toss upward as
they leap,
Curl-crested, on the sands; through their
dull plash.
And all the hum of sea-sounds, softly creep
The rustlings of the palm groves where the
wind
Moves the broad leaves about the clustered
fruit.
Here, on the shore, the sun is absolute,
Glinting on every ripple; but behind
The golden sands, the banks of tropic green
From their high tops throw shadow on the
scene.
The city traffic roars into my dreams.
The skurry of its movements round me
pours;
Yet fragrances of distant rippling streams
And the calm, lazy pea.ee of tropic shores
Live in this ragged island in the sea
Of dusty life. From ev'ry lustrous pile
I take my tribute, in my thought the smile
Of one more scene that waits to welcome me,
When with this argosy from distant lands
I meet the eager rush of ■childish hands.

The Grey Mare.
There’s not a breath to stir the vine
Along the eaves,
Nor snap the nets Arachne sets
Between the leaves:
And yet the storm has left its lair.
For high out-streams upon the air
The long tail of the wild, grey mare
That trots before the wind.
Her mane is blown across the moon
In filmy bars:
The drumming beat of rapid feet
Bedims red Mars
Till his fierce eye, across the night
Glowering from its airy height,
Burns like a beacon fired to light
The coming of the wind.
Her snowy kindred of the sea
Lift restless heads
To stamp and stir and call to her,
But swift she treads
The starry ways and flies more fast
As nearer swings the long lash cast
Behind her by each shouting blast
Of the pursuing wind.

There where love vanished grief shall also go.
O grave contentment, wherefore should 1
weep,
Save for myself forsaken? Though l keep
This watch a while with memory, I know
Change may not vex where time has ceased
to flow,
Where there is boon—the ultimate of'
sleep.
Beyond the gates of being, still and deep,
Lethean waters quench all human woe.
O splendid absolution that exalts
To such great peace our finite question-
ings !
Now grief shall be my friend, while memory
halts,
Lagging, reluctant of the spoil she brings,
Beside the mute, immeasurable vaults
Where blind oblivion stores all mortal
things.

ANOTHER DRINK IN LONDON.
“Tlie cables announce the underwriting in London
On behalf of the Commonwealth of a loan of
£(1,000,000, hearing interest at 5 per cent., with an
issue price of 994.” —Papers the other day, though
something of the sort happens any day.
High finance, Federal and State, consists in
paying accounts in London, from the millions
of interest on the external debt down to
the wages of Ann Drudge, deputy-cleaner of
the Government’s London office, with a bank
overdraft, and then floating a loan to pay
off the overdraft. Sometimes it may be that,,
through an excess of exports, there is a little
money, apart from borrowed money, available
at the other end, but this is a more and
more unusual event. Sometimes, as recently
happened in the case of N.S.W., the over-
draft grows so big that even a robust loan
fails to shift all of it, and then more high
finance is wanted very shortly. In theory the
money is for “permanent and reproductive
works” in Australia, but the theory is now
worn as thin as the fog of yesterday. Still,
in order that some shreds of the fog may
remain, a list of “works” is published annu-
ally, and enough items are included to make
tho total correspond fairly well with the
new debt. Many strange items wander in
because the struggle to put a good face on
things is keen. Thus the 1924-25 Federal
schedule included £162,953 on account of the
Commonwealth ships, though they have lost
most of the previous loan money spent on
them, and the despondent old fleet is no
longer being added to. Some lighthouses were
charged up, though they are certainly not
reproductive and cost a good deal for up-
keep : and a heap of money went for mili-
tary stores, which are neither productive nor
permanent, though they are necessary. The
Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway, which was
a through line with trains running on it 11
years ago, is still made the excuse for a
loan in London. So is l flic Oodnadatta-Port
Augusta line, which is much older. Neither
of them professes at present to be in a posi-
tion to pay interest on its old debt even in
local paper money, and when it is professed
to pawn them further as security for more
debt payable in gold the situation is gro-
tesque. “Vessels for lighthouse purposes”
appeared in the list to the extent of £150,177,
and “Passage money of assisted immigrants”
was down as security for £206,193. A trifle
of immigration money was paid out of
revenue, but the bulk was put into the other
category, where it helped to make the list
of “works” correspond with the amount
raised in John Bull’s metropolis for inter-
est, etc., falling due at the same spot.
The Commonwealth Government professes to
require six millions or so per annum for public
works in Australia, if purchase of “migrants.”
military stores and “Health” are really
public works. At least, it wanted 3£ mil-
lions in 1921, and it wants about six millions
now. and what it will want depends on how
its liabilities grow. Assuming that the
“works” yarn was true, instead of being the
polite but threadbare fiction on which poli-
ticians and other time-servers agree in order
to save trouble, the position should involve
no serious difficulty. The amount isn't really
very large, and could be borrowed in Aus-
tralia, if it had to be borrowed at all. The
local loan would be in the form of paper
money, but to pay for public works, including
land purchases and “Health,” in Australia
that is quite good. Save for a little silver
and bronze no one is paid in anything else.
The sums thus raised would go back into
circulation fast enough to avert serious com-
plications. Tt is possible, but not certain,
that the local interest rate would be higher:
still it is better to pay ourselves 6 per cent,
in notes, which we have, than to undertake
the payment to other people of, say, per
cent, in sovereigns, which we have not. The
AvlTole system of high external finance, by
which one loan inevitably leads to another,
and the second must, despite occasional fluc-
tuations, be larger than the first, arises from
the necessity for sending abroad huge sums,
mostly for interest, in gold, or in something
belonging to the Government which it. can
turn into that substance. Public works
have now little more bearing on the ease than
the weather has.
* * * #
The profoundly shaky nature of, the posi-
tion is presumably known to the seven Cabi-
nets of Australia, though it is wonderful
how little some of them may know and still
keep on Cabineting. The matter, viewed
from this end, is the whole fiscal question
folded small enough to pass through the eye
of a needle. If Australia lias any real ambi-
tion to keep solvent it must make its exports
exceed its imports by the amount necessary
to cover its annual outside liabilities. Aus-
tralia is a country without foreign investments
and with no carrying trade for foreigners,
like that of Britain, to bring in perhaps
£150,000,000 per annum. It hasn’t, like
Switzerland and Italy and in a less degree
Egypt, an almost equally good source of
income in looting the rich tourists who
swarm to view its mountains, glaciers,
waterfalls, temples, palaces, pyramids and
battlefields. It is just a plain business pro-
position. If Freetraders could show how to
produce a reliable and permanent surplus
of the necessary size by increasing the ex-
port of raw materials, and how to do it at
fairly short notice, then this paper would
even try its hand at being a convert to
Adam SMiTH-ism. But if the desired result
is only possible by drastically cutting down
imports and doing a great deal more with
local manufactures, then Adam ‘Smith is out
of the market. If the present method is
allowed to drift on it is possible that some
crisis may arise which will drive the Central
Government to commandeer the necessary
amount of exportable produce, pay for it in
Australian paper, and turn it into real money
with which to meet. extraneous troubles.
Then with so much less available to pay for
foreign motor-cars and things, the influx
would certainly diminish. When the Bruce
Page concern has a Royal Commission to
spare it might set it to inquire how Aus-
tralia can best contrive to live without ex-
ternal loans save renewal ones. But the
Commission should be strictly enjoined to
report within six months.
THE TAX REFORMERS.
The State Frights Premiers, who have had
another meeting in Melbourne to discuss the
abolition of the per capita payments, dis-
persed saying they had nothing at all to
propose except that the Commonwealth
Government should abandon its proposals.
The- conference would have been utterly
gloomy but for N.S.W. Premier Lang, who
provided the necessary diversion by posing
as a taxation reformer. He was reported as
follows:
The necessity for an immediate reduction in
income-taxation is recognised all over Australia. N. S.
Wales has met this demand recently by relieving
its taxpayers of a substantial portion of taxation. Why
doesn’t the Commonwealth follow suit?
The present Commonwealth Treasurer has
sins of his own not answered for. but he
has reduced the income-fax. In 1921-22.
the year before he took office. Federal
income-tax receipts reached £16,790,682.
By successive cuts lie brought; this amount
down last year to £11,136,344, and this
total included a lot of arrears. Iu September
he announced a further 124 p.c. reduc-
tion in rates, the concessions to the tax-
payer being calculated at £1.400.000. His
throe Budgets have brought little relief to
individuals receiving £5OOO p.a. or more,
and no relief at all to companies: but wage-
oarners and middle-class taxpayers have
benefited substantially. Lang has also intro-
duced three Budgets. In the first, that of
1920-21. he ruthlessly increased the rates
which were already much higher than in
other parts of Australia, except Labor-ruled
Queensland. Income from personal exertion
lie slogged as follows:
Rate of Tax in the £.
1919-20. 1920-21.
£7OO and under 11 pence 15 pence
£7Ol to £l7OO 12 „ 10 „
£l7Ol to £2700 13 „ 18 ~
£2701 to £4700 14 „ 20 „
£4701" to £O7OO 15 ~ 23 ~
£O7Ol to £9700 10 „ 27 ~
£9701 and over 17 ~ 30 ~
The Victorian rates for the same year are
subjoined;—
Rate of Tax in the £.
£5OO and under 3 pence
Over £soo t
On the first £5OO 4 ~
On the next £5OO 5 ~
On the next £5OO , 0
On the balance 7 ~
In short, Lang’s additions for one year
were greater, in nearly every instance, than
the entire Victorian rates. As a result,
his income-tax revenue hounded from
£2,308,207 in 1919-20 to £4.399.360 in
1920-21.
* * * *
Nevertheless, despite his increased exac-
tions, Lang’s crowd went in for such a
debauch of expenditure that it wound up
1920-21 with a deficit of £445,500, having
also added 164 millions to the public debt:
and the gentleman’s second Budget found
him morosely saying that he would have to
get another two millions from income-tax
or he wouldn’t be able to balance the ledger.
A general election arrived before lie had
completed his plans for extracting the other-
two millions; and he went out of office for
three years. In the course of those three
years his successors lowered the personal-
exertion rates to the following:—
£250 and under 9 pence
£251 to £5OO 10 ~
£5Ol to- £7OO 11 ~
£751 to £lOOO 12 „
£lOOl to £l5OO 13 ..
£l5Ol to £2OOO 14 „
£2OOl to £2500 15
£2501 to £3OOO 10 ..

£3501 to £-1000 19 ~
£4OOl to £5OOO 21 ..
£5OOl to £7OOO * 23 ~
£7OOl. and over 24
Further reductions were promised by George
Fuller in his policy-speech. Taxpayers
would be relieved to the extent of £500,000
in 1025-26. he said. Lang, for his part, de-
clared that Fuller’s promise “meant no-
thing” and that lie himself was the only
genuine tax-reducer. “If Labor is returned."
he went on, “steps will be taken at once to
lighten the burden of taxation now falling
on shoulders little able to bear it.” The
Lang way of carrying out this undertaking
was to raise the exemption from £250 ro
£3OO and to allow certain slight deductions
where the income does not exceed £9OO p.a.
The exemption was raised chiefly that Labor-
unionists might benefit, although the single
Labor-unionist earning £3OO p.a. is better
able to pay tax than married householders
iu receipt of £4OO or £5OO. There has been
no lowering of the Fuller rates. On the
contrary, those rates have been increased, in
a multitude of cases, by a 10 p.c. fine. This
time last year people, whose taxes fell due
iu 1924-25, which was mainly Fuller’s
year, were allowed, even urged in some in-
stances, to send along the money in 1925-
26, when Labor finance would get the benefit
of it, without exaction of the prescribed
penalty. But citizens who have asked for a
•similar concession during the last few weeks
have been curtly refused, the Government
having become anxious to get in every pos-
sible pound before July 1, so as to make the
results of its 44-hour week and other follies
look less appalling, for the time being, than
they really are. Further, those who are
paying a little less to the tax-gatherers be-
cause the exemption has been raised to £3OO
will pay a lot more to the insurance com-
panies (or the Government office which has been
rushed into existence in the Ministry’s bull-
at-a-gate fashion) owing to Lang's precious
Workers’ Compensation Act, which was
gagged through the Leg. Assembly with 60
of its 70 clauses undiscussed. To farmers,
pastoralists, manufacturers, builders, saw-
millers, shopkeepers and householders that
clumsily-contrived measure will be almost
as burdensome as the income-tax; in some
cases even more burdensome. In two North
Coast districts 28 sawmills are about to close
down, one employer saying that the new
premiums in his case are calculated at £5OO,
whereas his last year’s- profit was only
£6OO. Such is Lang, the great taxa-
tion reformer. As for the Queensland
Labor Government. which is echoing
Lang’s denunciations of Page, it has in-
creased the public debt from £56,869,000 in
1915 to £96,389,000 last year, while shoving
up the taxation from £954.457 to £3,914,161.
with the result that manufactures are stag-
nant and the State would be on the reeks
hut for Federal aid and foreign loans.
* * * *
Tax-reduction is an urgent necessity, but
it is not to be arrived at by handing the
public over to the tender mercies of the
Langs and McCormacks and Colliers.
Tt can only he brought about by a Common-
wealth Government with the will to deal
firmly with the State Frights Administra-
tions. first by cutting off their supplies of
easy money, and then by forcing them out
of the income-tax field, reserving its own
income-tax for war services, taking oyer
a fair proportion of the State debts and im-
posing sinking-fund conditions on all new
State issues, as well as its own.
THE AUSTRALIAN ROAD.
Ax engineer discusses the Australian road'
from another point of view (an earlier
article on the subject was printed B.
10/6/’2G) :
Without question cement concrete roads have their
economic place in most road-building programmes;
but even in America, concrete roads are still in the
experimental stage, as is shown by the recent report
of the Highway Research Board (Washington). Also
it should be borne in mind that cement manufac-
turers in America contribute upwards of G 400,000
annually to a fund used almost exclusively for adver-
tising and propaganda, purposes, and that many
articles apparently authentic are prompted by that
association and arc in many cases misleading.' Fur-
thei-, it should be borne in mind, when reading
articles published in America, that there is a great
deal of confusion in the nomenclature of the bitu-
minous industry. In America coal-tar is known as
bitumen, while what is known here as bitumen is) known
there as asphalt—that part of either tar or bitumen
which is soluble in carbontetra-chloride or hot benzol
is technically bitumen. Therefore, roads constructed
with either tar or bitumen are termed bituminous.
I do not know where the figures reporting 216
miles of bituminous roads and 2228 miles of concrete
road as having been laid last year in the U.S. were
obtained, but apparently the 2228 miles included all
of the- concrete roads constructed by all of the States,
including Federal-aid roads, while the 210 miles may
have been only Federal-aid roads, or one particular
type (hot-mixed bituminous concrete) of bituminous
roads. I have personal knowledge of the fact
that there were considerably more than 1000 miles
of another type of bituminous road —Tarvia penetra-
tration macadam —constructed in America last year.
Mr. IV. Calder, Chairman of the Victorian Coun-
try Roads Board, on his return from an eight-
months’ study of roads in England and America, was
reported as saying that there was no one best road
—that every known type had its economic place
under certain conditions. Broadly speaking, there
are seven types of roads —earth, gravel, waterbound
macadam, tar or bituminous macadam, penetration
macadam, bituminous concrete and cement concrete:
and engineers have many factors to consider besides
the simple one of which will last the longest without
repair. Conditions affecting the economic usefulness
of. these different types have the widest variation;
for example, T am familiar with one section in
America ■ where gravel roads maintained with a
Tarvia surface have proved to be the most economical
with traffic of 3000 vehicles per day. Gravel ideally
suited for a Tarvia* surface is readily available
throughout the district, and the only cost is for
hauling. Where traffic does not exceed 100-200
vehicles per day gravel roads can usually be main-
tained in satisfactory condition more economically
by use of a grader and adding gravel as required
than by tar surfacing.
Contrary to opinions generally expressed, water-
bound macadam properly maintained by tar surfac-
ing has not ceased to be an economic type; but
where traffic exceeds 800-1000- vehicles per day it is
generally more economical-to construct a penetration
macadam road unless the tar or bitumen adds more
than 15 per cent, to the cost of the top three inches
of macadam, for the reason that the saving in main-
tenance costs over a period of years will usually
equal or exceed the additional capital cost. . There
are in America literally thousands of miles of water-
bound tar-surfaced roads in good condition carrying
a traffic in excess of 1000 vehicles per day. I have
in mind a section 12 miles long constructed in 1017
on the Cleveland-Youngstown main road, which I
drove over in 1924 at GO miles an hour, and there
was not a bump or hole or break the whole length.
A traffic census taken that'year showed 1050 vehicles
per day, and Included ’buses with a 226 in wheel
base, and their running time between Cleveland and
Youngstown, GO miles, was only 21 hours. But unless
waterbound macadam is provided with a waterproof
surface it will not withstand automobile traffic as
well as most gravel roads.
Tar macadam so successfully and generally used
in England, or asphalt macadam (bitumen), is not
used in America, for the reason that penetration
macadam has been developed there to a state of
perfection at least equal to far macadam in England,
and costs materially less. There is a wide differ-
ence of opinion among engineers regarding the rela-
tive merit of asphalt (bitumen) and coal-tar for
constructing penetration macadam roads; but as
America is the home of bitumen and its market price
is often only about half the price of Tarvia or tar,
the latter would not be used for this purpose year
after year in increasing quantity unless it had
inherent merit not possessed by bitumen.
Except under unusual conditions as regards bearing
strength of the soil and supply -of aggregate and sand
suitable for concrete, there are very few concrete
roads constructed in America where the traffic is less
than 2000 vehicles per day. How many of the roads
to be constructed with the aid of the £20,000,000
the Federal Government is. providing during the next
10 years carry a traffic of 2000 vehicles per day, or
-will carry that amount of traffic during the present
generation? And the volume and character of traffic
is only one of many important factors' to be con-
sidered in selecting the most economic type of road.
Cement is the largest item of cost in a concrete
road; its market price here’ is three to four times
the price in America, and the cost of a concrete
road in Australia is anywhere from two to six times
the cost of penetration macadam. This wide varia-
tion is largely due to the foundation required under
different conditions; for example, a penetration
.macadam road may require nine inches of ballast
and three inches to six inches of macadam in order to
provide the necessary bearing strength, or it may
be laid directly on an existing gravel or waterbound
macadam road ; for a concrete road six inches or
eight inches of excavation may be necessary, or no exca-
vation at all. These are the extremes. A contract
has recently been awarded in N. K. Wales for 1$
mile of concrete road 30 feet wide, price £47,000 ;
extras estimated at £2OOO. Possibly in this case
concrete was warranted ; but how far would the road
appropriations of our States*go if roads 18 or 20
feet wide were to cost £20,000 per mile? What
this country, every country, needs is thousands of
miles of good road serviceable 3G5 days in the year
rather than a few, hundred miles of ideal road.
The interest charge alone for the first .three to five
years on the cost of a concrete road would generally
cover the total cost of a penetration macadam road
entirely suitable for the traffic; and while penetra-
tion macadam will require more maintenance, the
cost of proper maintenance will be only a small
fraction of the interest charge on the cost of concrete.
And make no mistake, there is no such thing as a
permanent road; further, when concrete requires re-
pairs it. presents problems that have not. been solved.
Coal-tar is an Australian product? the same as
cement, "and either should be employed when its use
is economically'sound. Bitumen is not an Australian
product and does not serve any purpose in any type
.of road-construction that cannot be served equally
well or better; by coal-tar properly prepared and
properly used, as has been so successfully proved
in both England and America. There seems to be a
lot more talk about Australian products than there
is effort to adapt them to Australian needs; there is
every reason why engineers spending public money
for road construction should make every effort to
obtain the good results from the use of tar that
have been obtained abroad. If they fail they should
find out why and try again. Wilson G. Harger, in
his recent book “Rural Highway Pavements,” says;
“A small percentage of all types of pavements fail
on account of poor design, poor " construction or poor
maintenance, but there is no such thing as type fail-
ure where even moderately good judgment is used in
(he design and maintenance. Road failures are per-
sonal human failures.” Failure to obtain satisfac-
tory results from the use of tar as compared with
bitumen in road construction and maintenance is a
personal human failure cither in the- preparation of
the tar or method of use, or both.


BABIES—LIMITED OR UNLIMITED?
Three weeks ago The Bulletin published
an article of mine on “The Ethics of Sup-
pression.” Since then, in two issues, cor-
respondents have debated the subject, most
of them attacking my conclusions. Birth-
control, readers have been assured, is both
wicked and dangerous from various points
of view. Let us consider their arguments.
There may be some doctors, as one of
them declares, who have liberal and just
ideas on this matter. I know there are many
lacking both, and there are those who, while
telling a woman of the almost certain death
awaiting her if she gives birth to another child,
yet fail to give her proper instructions in
avoidance of the danger. Several such cases
have come into my personal orbit: the result
has been motherless little ones, and the loss
to the community of fine women who, had
they had adequate and just help and instruc-
tion, would be alive and well to-day. (Inciden-
tally, several contributors to the discussion
assume that I am “single,” “indulging sexual
instincts” and “unencumbered.” In fact, I
am the mother of as fine specimens of young
manhood as Australia has produced; also,
I am a grandmother; and my convictions
are those of one who has had burnt into her
by actual experience those things of which
a man can never know anything.) “M.L.”
(who is a clergyman) makes absurd and un-
supported statements —most unusual in a
clergyman. The women of to-day, Dr.
Walsh to the contrary, are mentally and
physically and morally a finer type than
ever before. I dare to say that it is not
the indulging of sexual instincts or the use
of contraceptives that ensures moral degrada-
tion, but the concealment of the fact that
women have sure instincts. Peter Airey’s
argument is that of many men, and really
is no argument. He makes no secret of what
children are needed for —militarism, cannon-
fodder. If Germany had not been dread-
fully over-crowded she would not have in-
vaded France. James Edmond is the only
correspondent who sees clearly, and who has
some constructive ideas on the subject.
But, after all, this is essentially a woman’s
question, and she alone has the right to decide
it. She will gladly welcome the help and co-
operation of far-seeing men; but it is a
ghastly impertinence of man to dictate what
a woman .should want, must want. What
GoD-given attribute has he that he should
display such arrogance?
We need only observe almost any form
of plant life to realise that some similar
method is necessary in human life, too. It
is a simple truth, and one that any gar-
dener knows, that where are space and right
conditions seedlings will thrive and become
vigorous, healthy plants—things of beauty
and use. Where there is overcrowding, too
much call on the soil, the. plants will be
damaged irretrievably, he weedy, neither use.
nor ornament. The plants must be judi-
ciously thinned out, given good soil, air and
sunlight in abundance. Dame Nature is as
capricious as her sex is alleged to be, and
at times will produce stunted plants, but
you will observe that then there is usually
one strong plant that crushes the weaklings
by its overpowering growth. Does it not
then rest with the gardener to act judiciously
at an early stage and thin out, so that a
growth of sturdy, profitable plants results?
One would think that the dullest mind could
see the wisdom of adopting this method in
regard to too-abundant human life. But we
must not —need not —wait for the weeds to
appear; we must adopt methods that pre-
vent the possibility of any weeds coming
to light. And until we make use of the
great discoveries of science in regard to con-
traception we are wilfully neglecting one
more of Nature's lessons.
We need only glance- at China, India and
other Asiatic countries to feel convinced of
the absolute morality of birth-control and
the urgency of its operation. Bland, in his
book, “Houseboat Days in China,” speaks
to the point wdien lie says:—
One cannot see a Chinese village pullulating hordes
of children without realising the vital problem of
the East, a problem so immediate and tremendous
that it dominates the mind like an evil dream. A
third of humanity struggling hopelessly and increas-
ingly to procreate and maintain its swarm of pre-
destined hungry ones! And so the inexorable law
works out its pitiless solution, and these superfluous
millions go down to fatten the tired earth which
could not fatten them. Infanticide, rebellion and
disease, swift famine and slow starvation!
Yet many'people point to these nations as
an example for us to follow if we are to
keep our place in the sun. What have we to
fear from peoples like these? I refuse to
believe that these races are capable of any
real aggression. When they have been
taught to control the birth-rate, when they
lower it drastically, only then need they hope,
or we fear, that they shall make themselves
felt. A low birth-rate is necessary to racial
and social progress. It is the manifest duty
of the white races, first to teach their own
masses the morality and the duty of using
contraceptives, and next to put this great
factor for world- and race-betterment into
the hands of the Asiatic races.
It is not many years since Margaret
Sanger was prevented from entering Japan
to teach the women through contraceptive
clinics. As her own country, America, flung
her into prison because she persisted in
teaching the slum mothers and established
a clinic there, one could hardly expect Japan
to see the light. But Japan has been so
ready to adopt other less important Western
ideas that I feel sure once the Western
nations accepted birth-control as a vital
necessity, Japan would soon see eye to eye
with ns, and thus gradually the light would
be diffused through those unhappy wretches
who cannot be said to live—who merely exist
on the borderland of starvation and death.
What type of mind is it that can see virtue
or morality in this abomination?
The cruel and appalling reproduction of
the unfit, the enormous waste of child life in
all countries—what is it but the result of
reckless indifference?
Women will appreciate the importance of
this view more than men, as it is women who
must bear the anxieties of conception, the
miseries of gestation and the agony and
risk of parturition. And it is women who
know, even the most ignorant, that they are
justified in revolting against social customs
and religious dogmas which require them to
give birth to babes who are born only to lx;
buried. How desperate women of the'.poorer
classes become when faced with the pros-
pect of more babes they cannot afford to have
is shown by the prevalence of abortion. One
can but gather this from observation—that
abortion is practised by the poorer and pre-
vention amongst the richer people. Is it
not far more necessary that the former class
should be taught prevention than that they
should have recourse to the horrible thing?
As for the religious viewpoint—yes, I
know the Bible says “Be ye fruitful, multi-
ply and replenish the earth” ; but that com-
mand was issued to a handful of nomads in
a sparsely-populated corner of the earth.
How does that command stand when the
earth has been replenished? It is equally
absurd to rave and rant about “interference
with Nature.” The whole of our civilisa-
tion is an interference with Nature and an
adjustment of ourselves to our environment
and conditions.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Ail Attack on White Australia.
An International Labor Conference opened
in London on June 22, and it was empha-
sised that it was the first of the kind to
consider a single subject—migration. The
United States Laborites sent no representa-
tives, thereby intimating that the republic's
exclusion or restriction policy was not the
business of any outsider. Australian Labor
sent Evatt (N.S.W.) and Ivitson (West-
ralia ). Thereby showing much poorer appre-
ciation of the position, though probably a
much greater thirst for limelight. Britain,
iCanada, Maoriland and South Africa
were also present, but of the English-
speaking crowd Australia was the only
one with a climate which attracts colored
men, and at the same time has a
record empty space which abuts on the
world’s record mass of Brown Brotherhood.
The White Australia policy having thus
been brought into the arena, Evatt and
Kitson found that the whole business of the
17 European and Asiatic delegations was to
assert, as a Labor policy, that i body should
be shutout of anywhere merely “on the grounds
of race and color.” The Asiatics wanted
to get into Australia, and the Europeans
were willing to exhibit large-hearted gener-
osity by living away what doesn’t belong to
them. In fact, the proposers of the anti-
White Australia resolution were British
Laborites. The Australians, according to
the cable, intended to fight to the last ditch,
but they had no business in that ditch. The
ditch they should be in is one dug across
Australia from south to north, with men
working overtime at laying rails in it—
4ft. 84in. apart. The discovery of how many
enemies, or how many very inferior friends,
our ideals have, should move even the torpid
Commonwealth to fierce activity in the
matter of making its great blank area White,
which it certainly isn’t now. The other day
it was announced that the Sydney-Broken
Hill line was nearly finished, to supply a
duplicate southern coastal route to Perth.
(It really is southern and coastal when
viewed on the map.) The same day the
Federal Attorney General turned the 101st
sod of a duplicate coastal railway from
Sydney to the southern city of Brisbane.
(Brisbane is comparatively southern, being
in about the latitude of Lake Eyre, in S.A.)
Persistent nottering about these old places
may be useful in a small ivay, but it doesn’t
help the one big question along.

Italy and Australia.
People who imagine that Australia is escap-
ing the notice of Europe’s land-hungry mil-
lions, to say nothing of Asia’s, might run an
eye over the following by Dr. Barzini in the
Fascist Idea Nationale :
Why should a country like Australia, which is
manifestly unequal to the task of developing its vast
vacant spaces, bar out the immigrants of a European
country who possess strong arms, resolute wills and
intelligence Y Who gave them the right? Not
Great Britain. Have they the power in themselves
to enforce it ? Is there any justice in such exclusion ?
Think of what a million Italians would have made
of the vast fertile but empty spaces of Queensland,
five times the size of Italy, which in the course of
a century British immigrants have only scratched.
Britain has spent a hundred millions sterling on
their account, but actual capital without labor is of
small use, and the debt of the Queenslanders to
Great Britain is still one hundred millions..,. The
only reason the Australians can urge for their dog-
in-the-manger policy is the geographical unity of their
country. Australia is an island. The argument is
childish.... And, in any case, what of New Guinea?
Why have we not been granted a mandate?
When a virile land like Italy starts asking
such questions—a land that has 40 millions
of industrious citizens; a land, moreover,
that increases its numbers by half a million
per annum and can send 200,000 laborers
to France annually—it is time w r e woke up
to possibilities. The increase of our num-
bers is not unsatisfactory. Since 1850 the
U.S. multiplied its population by five, Canada
by four, Australia by nearly 15. Our popu-
lation per sq. mile is as good as that
of some of Italy’s Mediterranean neighbors.
Almost the whole of our danger arises from
the fact that the greater number of our
people are crowded into one corner of the
continent, almost a third of them in a couple
of cities, and no railways are being built
to lead the population into the empty spaces.
It isn’t lack of population that threatens
Australia so much as sheer lack of states-
manship.
A Young Man from Australia.
Among the burdens of life are phrasemon-
gers and purveyors of catchwords. Sydney
University turns out a fair share of them,
it being a passing fashion at that dimin-
ished seat of learning for the professors to
be Freetraders and the students heated Bol-
sheviks. One of the .Uni. products is Dr.
Evatt, who is now in his first Parliament,
and who professes, with the help of a Laborite
from Westralia, to represent the Common-
wealth at the “Labor World Migration Con-
gress,” a black-and-white gathering in Lon-
don. This is his wisdom, forwarded by cable:
The Australian Labor party’s policy embodied two
cardinal non-European principles—a White Australia
and safeguards against uncontrolled migration. The
latter included opposition to expenditure, not only
on assisted migration but on any migration, until
the land monopoly in Australia had been broken up
and the . unemployed absorbed.
So young men who practise neither agricul-
ture nor mining, the pastoral industry nor
any other productive occupation, desire with
great intensity to break up the land mon-
opoly—-in a country where, by last avail-
able figures, 94 per cent, of the surface is
Government property, and the rest is much"
subdivided! The bright and unproductive
young men want to break up land monopoly
even in the Northern Territory, where out
of every 10,000 acres the community in gen-
eral is owner of 9986 —with results which
seem short of satisfactory. In the same
category is the ambition to stop all influx of
population till the local unemployed are
wholly absorbed. The matter has been con-
sidered for a great number of years, and at
last many people have been driven to the
opinion that there never will be a time when
the workless are all absorbed, any more than
there will be one when the dead are
all buried. It seems that there will
always be some people awaiting jobs
and burial. Perhaps it is not an un-
mixed evil, for if the unemployed were wholly
absorbed it would be no use for the Evatt
family to advertise for a cook or housemaid
or anybody else when it comes back from
England, and it would have to do all its
work itself. In this connection it looks a
wrong, or at least a suspicious, action that
Evatt himself should have burst into the
barristerial profession after finishing with
college without first making sure that no
existing barristers were on the bread-line
or worse. Probably there were legal
brethren who had never seen a brief, and
who viewed the new man’s advent with dis-
favor. Taking all things into consideration
it is futile for any political party to send
a young man with a year’s Parliamentary
experience as far as Europe to tell com-
munities which have got the habit of export-
ing population very badly that they should
learn to solve their economic problems with-
out it. This is especially so when the speaker
supplies no solution and when he represents
a recently-exported community himself.

Soldier Settlement in Tasmania.
The Tas. Government has asked the Chief
Justice and a skilled accountant to overhaul
the machinery of the Soldier Settlement
Department and ascertain whether it is
working quite efficiently and economically,
and. if not, why not. It is rumored that the
Audit Department has found difficulty in
obtaining satisfactory accounting for all live
stock, seed, etc., supplied to soldier settlers,
and has, of course, declined to certify that
everything is all right. Live stock may easily
get lost in the bush or fall into the creek and
get drowned, and possibly may be eaten,
horns, hoofs and all. bv wild animals like
frogs or tadpoles; and if a heifer or a few
sheep wander - over the range and eventually
find a new owner in the next county, who is
to say that the unfortunate soldier settler
is to blame if he fails to find his lost animals
before they have been converted into wholly
unrecognisable sausages? And would it be
a fair thing to compel a dinkum Digger so
situated to pas; heavy arrears to the depart-
ment? Of course agricultural implements '
are different from live stock; a double-furrow
plough or a set of harrow’s could not wander
across the range, except in a cart. Still, it
is reported more or less reliably that some
Tas. returned soldiers’ goods of this class
are posted missing. In some cases it is
allegeu that the soldier settler himself goes
missing fairly frequently; that is, he wan-
ders casually away from his heart-breaking
selection and forgets to return, and also
forgets to notity the department that its
inspector, if any, may find the key of the
cabin under the kerosene tin by the back
door, and the last six demands for instal-
ment arrears behind the clock on the mantel-
piece. Everything connected with the busi-
ness is more or less casual, and lately it
has been so much more than less that the
Auditor-General thinks something should
be done about it. Hence the Royal Com-
mission. Presumably the Chief Justice’s
report will be available when Parliament
meets in a month or so. Unfortunately
(or otherwise) the Assembly will have to
discuss it without’ the assistance of either
of its two soldier members. Captain Mar-
riott is on a trip to Britain, and Lieut.
Jim Hurst has just resigned his seat —says
he can’t live on the £3OO salary and has a
better billet waiting for him on the mainland.
He is a son-in-law of Lands Minister Bel-
ton, upon whose shoulders much of the
trouble is falling.

Great Estate in Melbourne.
The ridiculously overgrown cities of Aus-
tralia produce overgrown land values, and
these produce other things, including anoma-
lies, Domain orations and weird persons who
talk about planting a Million Farmers on a
Million Farms. The Commonwealth levies a
land-tax under which there is a £5OOO ex-
emption for the local owner, but none for the
absentee. This probably helps to account
for the decay of absenteeism, which hardly
exists now save in the heated imagination
of candidates who see an election ahead,
and offer to scotch the nebulous serpent
for a consideration. The Commonwealth
served notices for £29,214 on absentees in
1922-23, which showed them to own less
than 11 per cent, of the big estates in point
of value, and if the exemption had applied
equally, the non-resident individual probably
would have mod for less than 1 per cent.
The average aluernf each big taxed property
was £11,316, which is nothing very great.
When the large holdings pan out like that,
the average value of all holdings must be
moderate. The tax is graduated with a
special view to the breaking-up of bloated
freeholds, and it appears to be doing its
work. In fact, the bogey of the great pro-
spective land accumulator and monopolist,
which caused the rulers of Queensland and
the Northern Territory to entirely stop the
sale of freeholds, looks a thinner appari-
tion than it used to do, and if necessary
it could be further thinned by judicious vari-
ation of the tax system. But a curious feat-
ure of the case is that a “great estate,” which-
in theory shrieks to be broken up. is classed
according to value only. In point of size
it may approach the irreducible minimum.
Nearly half the Federal land-tax is now
collected in cities and in a very few big
towns, where vast squattages are rare, and
the remarkable position grows more remark-
able. In 1918-19 the tax yield from urban
lands was 38 per cent, of the total. In
1922-23 (the figures are not strikingly up
to date) the cities paid 46 per cent. A
tale was recently told in Melbourne about
an estate with an alleged value of £l5OO
per foot apart from improvements, for which,
with improvements, the tenant paid £4O per
week. That is to say, the tax department
charged the landlord £2l per week, the
landlord charged the tenant £4O, and the
tenant charged the customers enough to
aggravate the high cost of living. The reason
assigned for not cutting up this “big estate”
was that it measures 20ft. across, and can
hardly be divided without squashing the
tenant. In the three years before the aboli-
tion of the super-tax made comparisons diffi-
cult, the revenue extracted from nominally
big town estates increased by £190,844,
while that from really big country
estates diminished by £143,903. The
figures certainly suggest that with smaller
cities and more of them the cost of living,
as well as the number of people run oyer
by motor-cars, might; be less. A question
arises about here as to how the freehold system
might affect the Northern Territory. There
is every reason to believe that with a through
railway and some branches, and with the
freehold added, population would increase
and towns spring up. The sale of freeholds
might; help to clear the debt off the railways.
If some freeholds were made rather large
at first in order to attract men with money,
thei’e would be the satisfaction of knowing
that as-values increased the graduated land-
tax could get busy and make them smaller.
The position is that in 1923-24 South Aus-
tralia paid to the Commonwealth £162,593
in land-tax, and to its own Government
£184.226, making £346,819 in all. This
was apart, from land revenue, and was ex-
tracted from freeholders; yet S. Australia
is only about 6 per cent, freehold as yet.
The Northern Territory, which is larger
and many times more blessed in the matter
of rainfall, yielded, under the leasehold sys-
tem, £18,954 in rents and £99 in land-tax.
Apparently there is much more to be made
by taxing the freeholder than by collecting
rents from the leaseholder—the way the
Federal Government does things, anyhow.

Snowden Changes His Mind.
There was a time when Philip Snowden
was regarded as the one unchanging landmark
amid the shifting scenes of the British Labor
movement. Others might drift to the right
or to the left —to guilds and co-operation or
to syndicalism and philosophic anarchy—but
Snowden stood solid for the Socialist
Commonwealth, a sea-green incorruptible.
As time went on one after the other of the
Old Guard faltered in bis allegiance. Ber-
nard Siiaw and Wells ceased to preach the
great gospel; the Webbs sank with a
gurgling cry amid a sea of statistics; Rob-
The Challenge.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The doctrine of White Australia has been seri-
ously attacked.” — Cable.
Stand fast! The challenge of the years rings
clear!
The doubtful waver and the weak are
dumb !
The guarded gate is. closed; but loud and
near
Are shuffling steps of those who fain would
come
To share this heritage of sun and soil
We hold in trust for all the white man’s
race.
Shall what wc hold become an alien’s spoil,
And Asian hands our dream of years
deface ?
We have seen far and far through time’s
pale mist
The wonder of a thousand years to be.
A land of countless homes by sunshine kist
Within a circle of unbroken sea;
And we have dreamed that stalwart men and
true
And gracious women strong to play their
part
Would keep for ever that high faith the few
Held as the pulse-throb of a nation’s heart.
Discordant voices from the long-dead years
Shout down the clear strong tones of
Greece and Rome,
Where once the white man, brave among his
peers,
Guarded against the world his hearth and
home.
Persia was broken, Egypt fell to dust
Where Macedon’s high banners took the
sun,
Till easy days betrayed the olden trust
And mingled races left the field unwon.
Beside the blue iEgean Sappho sang
Clear, simple songs that moved the heart
of Greece
Through seven fair centuries ere Christ-
bells rang
To strange, wild discord in the name of
peace.
Where that white singer at her casement
stood
The slipshod Asiatic holds the street;
Not Christ but Allah rules, and a mixed
brood.
Unwashed, unlettered, goes with aimless
feet.
Shall wc, too, yield—cry in the name of peace
An open door for all who seek to come,
And watch the alien hordes grow and
increase,
While we stand by with idle hands and
dumb ?
No! All the past is as a beacon light
To guide the future on a surer way.
Shall we for fear be traitors to that white,
Clear ray that leads us to a larger day?
Whole in both heart and will, a white man’s
home,
The great Australia of the future calls
In grander tones than ever Greece and Rome
Heard in their first young pride of guarded
walls.
Let who will yield, our children’s children yet
Shall bless that clear, far vision that we
saw—
Australia as the white man’s bulwark set
To hold the white man’s dreams, the white
man’s law!

TheTOP-NOTCH'Scotch
ert Blatchford —at whose desertion even the
hosts of Tuscany could scarce forbear a
groan—found that Henry Ford had invented
a‘' better recipe for the Millennium than
"Nunquam’ used to prescribe with such
loud clashing of the cymbals of logic. And
now Snowden sinks his axe deep in the neck
of the carcase of the class war and says
that trade-unions must cease their policy of
antagonism to the employers. The workers
must realise that they are partners in
industry, and that they have as much interest
in improving their own efficiency as their
employer has. He added, as was only right,
that the employers mustn’t kill the goose that
laid golden eggs by wringing its neck after it
started laying; but that was something any-
one would have said, and which long-sighted
captains of industry have been saying for
years. The beginnings of the change in
Philip Snowden were made manifest about
a year ago, when he began to study the
industrial methods of Uncle Sam and found
a notion quite after his own heart in the
formation of working-class banking institu-
tions. And then, of course, there is Mrs.
Snowden, clever, attractive, ambitious
and as hard-headed as her husband. She has
seen the Sovieteer in his native lair and has
found the beast an offence against high
Heaven. That way, obviously, madness lies,
and the Snowdens have had to reconstruct
their social theories. It might be unjust
and small-minded to say that the process
has been assisted by the experience the couple
had while he was Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer. Probably the change will be politi-
cally fatal to the husband, who will share the
fate of Ramsay Macdonald, “Uncle Arthur”
Henderson and J. H. Thomas —all now
regarded by militant Laborites as either
dodderers or renegades. It’s the brisk fellows
who can go on talking about the wage-slaves
and the disinherited proletariat, and can
open up a vista of months of glorious strikes
and empty bellies, who capture the imagina-
tion of the manual worker of to-day.

“Leamington” : When the Australian Mili-
tary Forces, as from May 1.1921. adopted the
organisation of the A.1.F.. each unit was
entitled to have emblazoned on its King’s
Colors or Guidons the names of not more
than 10 of the engagements in which H.Q.
and at least 50 per cent, of the parent A.I.F.
unit participated. These battle honors are
allotted in accordance with War Office in-
structions, and little regard was paid to Aus-
tralian sentiment when the regulations were
promulgated. The Army Council instruc-
tion allows for tin l formation by each unit
of a committee of suitably informed officers
to decide which honors will be claimed, but
their choice is limited to the list of engage-
ments compiled by the Battles Nomencla-
ture Committee. From the Australian view-
point this list is totally inadequate. It ex-
cludes such Australian actions as the Chess-
board. Quinn's Post, Lone Pine, Anzac,
Fromelles. Thilloys, the first attack on Bulle-
court. Lagnieourt, Hamel, Mont St. Quentin
and Pennine: hence the Australian Com-
mittee is making strong representations to
the. War Office for their inclusion. Pro-
vision is certainly made for the submission
of special claims where the list is considered
incomplete, but the Australian authorities
rightly decided on a wholesale claim for the
engagements aforesaid. Anyhow, the nomen-
clature itself is faulty and in some cases
absurd. How ridiculous it is for the 18th
Battalion to have to submit a special claim
for the emblazonment on its colors of Hill
HO. where 99 p.c. of its personnel became
casualties. 20 p.c. being killed in action
And who in the 18th Battalion—or Australia
for that matter —recognises the tragedy of
Hill HO under the name of the Battle of
Scimitar Hill, which is the title allotted it
by the Committee?

The Maorilaud Government Statistician, who
shows an increasing disposition to prophesy
the future in the light of the past, made a
graph some time ago showing that the tremu-
lous islands would have a population of
2.400,000 whites in 1950 if all the to-morrows
were as the yesterdays of the last, 40 years.
The latest quinquennial census, however,
shows a slackening off from the rate of in-
crease maintained between 1881 and 192.1,
which averaged out at about 2.4 per cent.
Per annum. The average annual rate be-
tween 1921 and 1926 has been only 2.13 per
cent., despite assiduous and ostensibly suc-
cessful attempts to encourage migration. The
Maorilaud birth-rate, like that of most other
civilised countries, goes on decreasing. Twenty
years ago it was 27 per 1000 of population
P.a. To-day it is just a shade over 21 per
1000; and, though the infant mortality rate
has, in the meantime, been considerably de-
creased as the result of the teachings of that
remarkable man Truby King, the salvage is
not sufficient to make up the leeway. Migra-
tion is hindered by the British dole system
and natural increase is hindered by a wide-
spread application of the principles of birth
control. The general average of intelligence
among Maorilanders is high ; there is prac-
tically no illiteracy amongst citizens of nor-
mal mentality, and only the bare beginnings
of a slum population. For the last 30 years
the general condition has been one of pros-
perity, and prosperity is not the
Manchester School economists thought it was
—conducive to a high birth-rate. The only
folk in Maonland who, as a class, seem to
be carrying out heartily Dick Seddon’s ad-
vice about filling the cradles are the Maoris.
The native race, which every now and then
seems to be started on the greasy slide to
extinction, and which showed decreases in the
quinquennial periods 1891-96 and 1911-16, to
go no further back, has in the last five years
increased and multiplied to the extent of 19
per cent. —quite double the best rate shown
in the previous four quinquenniums. The
dark hand of that very influential and astute
prophet Katana seems to be discernible in
the latest figures, though part of the apparent
increase probably is due to improved census
methods.

An interesting habit among Queensland poli-
ticians is that of elevating themselves and
each other to the Bench when they weary of
the uncertainty of politics and yearn for a
long-sentence billet with good pay. Other
politicians consider the idea good, and J. E.
West, of East Sydney, lately raised the
question in the House of Reps. He pro-
posed, to begin with, that all the Arbitration
Judges save one (and he didn’t seem par-
ticular about him) should be men with an
“SWING ME JUST A LITTLE BIT HIGHER, OBADIAH, DOE
intimate knowledge of industry rather than
legal training. In other words, the great bulk
should be “sturdy toilers” —like West. The
men in Parliament, being lawmakers, how-
ever unfit for the work, have the job of con-
structing statutes which are clear and defi-
nite, and show traces of acquaintance with
industry. (Sometimes they dash together an
Act of 70 clauses like the N.S.W. Workmen’s
Compensation Act, and by smothering all
debate on 60 clauses prevent the blunders
being pointed out even by themselves, and
then the measure mas' be less perfect than
it should be.) After that the kind of Judge
required is not so much a man who knows
all about, say, silver-mining, and nothing
about any other trade, as one with intelli-
gence and education, who can accurately
define and administer what the politicians
enacted concerning silver-mining and a multi-
tude of other trades, tree-felling and seaman-
ship included. The judicial person should
be a highly capable and thoroughly snir-
minded interpreter, and technical knowledge
is of secondary importance. If a man is
wanted to translate a standard Greek treatise
on the use of elephants in agriculture, it is
much more important that he should be well
up in Greek than that he should know either
elephants or agriculture, or even a little of
both.
‘"Feng-Shui” : The conservatism of the
white man in the tropics, recently under dis-
cussion, goes further than his clothes. .It
is a native saying in the hot places that noon
is a time when only dogs and Englishmen
are abroad. The mot is just, except as re-
gards the dogs. In most British settlements
in the tropics the hours of work are from
9 to 5 in offices and 9 to 6 in shops, just
as in Puddlington-on-Ice; and 1 was sad-
dened on revisiting Java lately to find that
British competition had forced the practical
Dutchman to abandon his siesta and repair
to his kantoor in the afternoon with his
rijstafel undigested. Little work is done.
The eyes become like lead, the curry rice
appears to be surging through one’s veins,
and one kicks the punkah coolie to relieve
one’s feelings. But why should tropical
Queensland follow this idiotic precedent?
An attempt to bring in a two- or three-hour
break in the middle of the day was resented
in the North, and for good reasons; but why
shouldn’t everybody work from six in the
morning until two and have freedom for the
rest of the day?

“Dr. Nil’’ : The discussion concerning the
use of Latin figures and symbols instead of
the metric system in medical prescribing is
interesting, but somewhat beside the real
point at issue. When I was a student one
had to learn to write prescriptions in un-
abbreviated Latin, quantities being indicated
by words, not figures. We were not expected
to make use of this method in actual prac-
tice ; the idea was that the prescription
would be readable in most European coun-
tries. But the thing that was dinned into
us was that, no matter in what character
or language we wrote the formula, it must
he unmistakably leyible. There is no diffi-
culty in making certain of this, whether one
uses Roman ngures and signs or any other.
Also it is cmite easy, by slovenly writing, to
make any prescription dangerously illegible,
and to do so is a serious offence against one's
own conscience. Nor is there any excuse for
a doctor showing annoyance at a chemist for
referring to him, privately, any doubtful
point. It is the chemist's bounden duty to
do so. Incidentally, the change over to the
use of the metric system by those who have
used the old style for many years would be
by no means unattended by dangers of its
own.

At the present time there is an indirect
bounty on cane-sugar, the producers having a
monopoly of the local market at £27 per
ton while the nominal price outside is £9 10s.
The amount of the cotton guarantee or
bounty is in process of negotiation. Rice-
growers have intimated that they think they
could shove their agricultural chariot along
if granted a bounty of £4 10s. per ton.
And the other day a letter about move
assistance appeared in the S. M. Hekall>
signed “W. Digby Denham,” a name well
known in produce and political circles. The
writer alleged that N.S. VV. is now importing
maize and onions from Japan and S. Africa,
which are colored-labor countries, and oats,
potatoes, onions, hams and cheese from Can-
ada and Maoriland, which are white. Where-
fore he urged that all local growers of
maize, wheat, oats, potatoes, onions, fat
lambs, pigs and dairy produce who start
in the business after July 1 should be free
from income-tax and local rates for seven
years. Yet there are still quite a lot of
farmers who honestly think that the man on
the land neither gets nor asks much help
from Governments, and that the manufac-
turer is as bad as a bushranger when he
holds out his hand for a little assistance.

The High Court of the South-West African
Protectorate is considering an application
which may prove of considerable interest to
Australia. William Hoiienzollern, once
Emperor of Germany, is applying to restrain
the Administrator of the one-time German
possession from dealing with his (Bill's)
property in the protectorate, for which the
S’African Union holds the mandate. Wil-
liam contends that the Treaty of Versailles
does not apply to his properties in mandated
territories, and has briefed a Jo’burg lawyer
to handle his case. The Bulletin doesn’t
know if the Hoiienzollerns own any pro-
perty in Australia proper, but they certainly
held or hold some in German New Guinea,
both in their own names and as shareholders
in companies. If the ex-Kaiser regains his
holdings at Windhoek —probably diamond-
iferous concessions—he will certainly reach
out for his confiscated assets in New Guinea
and Samoa.

“Bouragi” : Like others who have objected
to my theory that the British are disinclined
to mix their blood with that of discolored
races, “Cocoanut” (B. 24/6/’26) has con-
fused particular instances with general con-
ditions. My contention was, and is, that, as
a colonising race, the British have never
followed the example of other peoples and
begotten new races of half-castes. “Cocoa-
nut” cites the prevalence of half-castes in
the Gulf of Carpentaria as proof. The total
number of half-castes in Australia on the
abo. census of 1924 is 12,302, of all ages,
and the white population may be taken as
six millions; further, a very large propor-
tion of even the handful of half-castes are
of Malay, Chinese and other non-British
parentage. So I reiterate that, though the
most widespread ,colonisers on earth, the
British have not created great new races of
hybrids as have (a)* the Spanish in the South
Americas, (b) the Portuguese in India; (cl
the Dutch in their Indies, to take three
striking instances.
. ♦
“Country Ped.” : In the United States, so
little has teaching come to be regarded as a
worth-while occupation for men, numerous
large primary schools are wholly staffed by
women; and Australia is drifting into a
similar position. It is only in the past de-
cade or so that our educationists have come
to realise that the majority of our citizens-
to-be, whose schooldays so often end at 14
years of age, need to be educated on tin*
playing fields as well as in the class-rooms,
quite as much as their more fortunate
brethren of the secondary schools. For years
past such bodies as the Vic. State Schools
Amateur Athletic Association have stressed
this side of education by encouraging sports
and athletic contests amongst the pupils of
primary schools. Now with official sanction
(in Victoria) one hour per school week is
set aside that the whole school may take
part in organised games. The Defence
Department has a number of instructors en-
gaged throughout the year in training
teachers in this, from its point of view, most
important branch of education. But if our
schools are ultimately to be staffed and
controlled by women, how are the boys of
the future going to be taught their manly
exercises, games and sports? The position
must be faced now, for already headmasters
are puzzled how to cope with this new de-
mand without the aid of young male teachers,
the natural instructors for games and
athletics.

"Light Horse”: A hoodoo seems to wait on
memorials to those who fell in Sinai and
Palestine. Australia’s equestrian group for
the Suez Canal has been delayed for years 1 ,
and was further put back by the death of
Australian sculptor Webb Gilbert, who had
it in hand. Now Allenby’s idea of a mem-
orial af Jerusalem is to be abandoned. Costs
were too great, though cash in hand, to
which all Australian units in Palestine sub-
scribed, came to £13,000. The money is to
be devoted to a memorial chapel in the Jeru-
salem War Cemetery, the Australian sub-
scribers’ reps, having consented.

POLITICAL
POINTS
State Frights Premiers and reactionaries
of various brands are overdoing the cry .that
the people are boiling with fury at Bruce’s
mild plans for.readjusting the Federal-State
financial arrangements and extending the
Commonwealth powers. The ill-assorted
band might be believed to some extent if
there was an outbreak of public meetings,
but not one has been reported. In fact, there
is no sign whatever of a rally to the State
Frights cause, although Premiers and editors
and some of the A.L.P. executives are doing
their best. It "was suggested that the Senate,
influenced by the imaginary explosion of
public feeling, might throw out the Consti-
tution Alteration Bills. In point of fact,
the essential-services measure was passed by
28 to 8; and on the third reading .of the
industry-and-commerce proposals there was
one lone non-content —Barwell, the queer
blackbird from South Aus.
Mann, M.H.R. for Perth, has given notice
of amendment to the bill abolishing the per
capita payments, his proposal being that the
Commonwealth should take over State debts
to the extent of “the capital sum interest on
which at 5 p.c. p.a. equals the amount repre-
sented by 255. p.h. of the population on June
30.” He would let the Commonwealth Trea-
surer specify the particular debts to be Fed-
eralised ; the total last year was £606,058,000
and the interest ranged from 3 p.c. to 7J
p.c. Mann’s idea is that the Commonwealth
should, (unconditionally) relieve the States
of, roughly, 25 p.c. of their liabilities. The
Commonwealth should reject the proposal
unless the States, which have already been
promised the Federal taxes on land, enter-
tainments and dead men’s property, are will-
ing to- give up taxing incomes. In that case
the National Government could afford to take
over 50 p.c. of the State debts while sim-
plifying and substantially reducing taxation.
How slovenly the new N.S.W. Workers'
Compensation measure is can be judged by
the fact that the Government’s insurance
department didn’t know whether to charge
40s. or 20s. per cent, for the sickness cover.
At first it was 405., the same as the associ-
ated offices were asking; but as the Govern-
ment had been howling at the underwriters
for their rapacity, the politician evidently
got to work and told the actuary to haul
down the rate to 20s. And the actuary
knows so little what the law means that he
complied.
On December 3 N.S.W. Premier Lang
said he would have a surplus of £14,000 at
the end of 1925-26. At the beginning of the
week the deficit was estimated at £BOO,OOO,
although £1,176,000 of 1924-25 income-tax
was carried over into 1925-26. For services
rendered to the heroes of the 1917 railway
strike Lang has been presented with an illu-
minated address and a grandfather’s clock.
It would pay N. S. Wales to give the wordy
disaster half a million conditionally on his
keeping out of politics for the rest of his
days.
Westralia was offered a new industry the
other day. The Sunshine Harvester works
in Victoria are run on piecework principles,
and wages are high and strikes very rare.
It was proposed to open a factory in West-
ralia, * which is very short in this line, and
help to remove the local grievance about
being “flooded with Eastern State products,”
but the local autocrats stood fast for their
day-labor fetich, so no business resulted.
The professional strike-maker, taking his cue
from Moscow, is utterly opposed to any plan
which would make the workers contented.
The marvel is that the workers allow them-
selves to be made fools and tools of.
Vic. Premier John Allan followed tradi-
tion by going into his own electorate to deli-
ver his pre-sessional policy speech, but he
didn’t take a retinue with him as did most
of his predecessors in office. About 100
Kyabramites heard John hold forth on
amendment of the standing orders, redistri-
bution of seats, social reforms, metropolitan
improvements, a rural bank and better pro-
tection of forests; and Kyabram was duly
impressed. Allan, by the way, went away
from Melbourne without the notes of his
speech. He entrusted them to Junwirth, his
private sec., but Junwirth missed the train
because a taxi didn’t turn up in time, and
had to race to Seymour in a car.
The clauses of the N.S.W. Workmen’s Com-
pensation Act which make the employer
liable whether the employer has control of
the workman or not are causing a lot of the
trouble with which Ma State has been seeth-
ing. A young man who chooses to scorch
to his job on a motor-bike has to be main-
tained all his life if he crashes on the way
and gets permanently disabled. A timber-
getter who undertakes to bring in logs for
Smith and Jones and half a dozen other
NOW FOR THE UPS AND DOWNS.
“The Government’s latest ideas on the Industrial Referendum issue include a provision for the
Arbitration Court to be over-ruled by Parliament on the questions of hours and wages.”
THE POLITICAL GENT .: “Push off, Grandad, and make room for your uncle. Pll show
you how to keep ’em amused.”
buyers, and who would tell the lot to go to
the Devil if they tried to interfere with his
method of working—he has to be “covered,”
too; and the cover is very expensive. If you
hire a gardener one day a week you have
to pay 10s. a year for his insurance; if
you hire him a day and a half you still pay
10s.; but if you hire him two days a week
the Government charges you £5. . Hundreds
of men have been sacked already, and hun-
dreds more will be sacked. It is a good
measure in principle hopelessly spoiled by
conceited bunglers who wouldn’t take advice.
'J'ypical of the apathy with which .Mel-
bourne nowadays regards public affairs was
the result of the poll taken in Fitzroy on
the question of amalgamating with the city.
Fitzroy has an enrolment of 7493 ratepayers
with the right to cast 11,563 votes, but only
1855 votes were recorded. There was a
majority of 593 for amalgamation, and so it
will take place.
Lobby gossip in the Queensland Parlia-
ment predicts an increase in members’
salaries from £5OO to £750, and of Minis-
ters’ salaries to £l5OO. At present Min-
isters nominally receive £lOOO (it was re-
duced while Theodore’s 5 p.c. cut was in
operation) ; but as the nine salaried Minis-
ters had to pay an honorary, their actual
income was only £9OO p.a. The honorary
(D. A. Gledson) having been raised to full
rank, there are two more Cabinet Ministers
than there were when Theodore took charge.
Premier McCormack (as Treasurer) receives
the same pay as the others; but he gets an
extra £3OO as Chief Secretary. Salaried
Ministers do not receive Parliamentary pay.
T. J. Ley, sometime N.S.W. Minister of
Justice, made a poor start in the House of
Peps, by opposing the Senate’s request for
a small increase in the duty on foreign films.
In doing so he merely echoed the whines of
the importing crowd, its press-ageuts and
’Uckerby and ’Arrop of the Theatrical Em-
ployees’ Union, Ley is a fluent talker and
a clever campaigner, but he is always itching
to impose imported fads and follies on
his native country. First it was prohibi-
tion ; then it was proportional representa-
tion ; now it is Hollywood pictures. If he
is to do any good in Australian politics
he will have to muster up some Australian
sentiment.
A recent happening in Melbourne was a
meeting of 500 'grocers to debate the sugar
shortage, and to demand that Bruce-Page
should see that the city has always eight
weeks’ supply in case of siege. There is
surplus sugar in North Queensland, but rail-
way freights for that distance are almost
prohibitive now. The N.S.W. lines’ charge
for groceries is close on £lO per ton for 500
miles, and that’s only about one-third the
distance. So trust is put in the coastal ship,
and the mostly-imported cranks and crooks
are always stopping the coastal ship. Their
success is evidenced by the monotonous re-
port that the s.s. Rabbit is doing its last
trip, having been sold to Chinese or Jap or
Chilean owners. The Melbourne grocers said
that supplies have become too precarious,
and suggested free imports, if the Bruce-Pago
has no other remedy.
“Detonator”: If Australian Governments
wish to put down vote-duplication and -mul-
tiplication (B. 3/6/’26), they should adopt
French electoral methods. Each elector is
provided with an elector’s identity card. This
must be produced before a ballot-paper is
handed over by the presiding officer, together
with the elector’s birth-certificate. The card
and certificate are kept until after the elec-
tion, when they are returned to the owner.
No person can vote unless he produces
these documents. It is certainly a longer
and more tedious business than ours, but
it makes personation practically impossible.
No person unable to read and write is
allowed to vote in France, and the anomaly
may be seen of an educated nigger voting
while .the white illiterate comes a thud.
The Lang Government evidently hates a
man to get more than the basic wage or
thereabout —unless, of course, he’s a politi-
cian. Under the new Workers’ Compensation
law the employer has to pay for a man
according to the wages or salary he gets—
twice as much for a man getting £l2 a
week as for one getting £6. But, generally,
the man who gets £l2, though twice as
much has been paid for him, will be allowed
to draw no more than the man who gets £6.
If a private insurance office proposed to pay
the same benefits whether the premium was
£lO or £2O a year, somebody would say it
was either a rogue or quite mad.
Minister Loughlin holds that five-year Par-
liaments would be better than the triennial
sort in N.S.W., his explanation being that
the three years is taken up in giving legis-
lative effect to the party programme, and
the election arrives before the beneficial con-
sequences have a chance to develop. Another
two years he holds, would give time for the
vegetable to come up. But there is no visible
reason why the statesmanlike reform enacted
in the first month of 1929 shouldn’t at least
be putting forth buds of promise by Decem-
ber, 1932.
History repeats itself —usually with a
difference. 'Langs dive into sickness-
and accident-insurance recalls what was
done by Seddon 25 years ago. The M.L.
insurance cos. were not prepared to under-
write risks arising under the new Compen-
sation Act, or wanted fantastic premiums,
so the Government stepped in. But it did
not step in as a tyro. The Government Life
Insurance Office had been going for 32
years; also liabilities were well defined and
specifically limited. Furthermore, with a
mass of statistics in the Labor Department,
there was some sort of actuarial basis to
build on. The branch now has assets
amounting to £200,000 —accumulated out of
thin air, since it had no capital to start
with. But if Lang does as well he’ll be
lucky, since whatever anybody does must
be done almost wholly in the dark —thanks
to the vagueness of the law.
When a Sydney Labor alderman tries to
break away he doesn’t get far. O’Dea of
Camperdown was staggered to find that the
estimated cost of erecting municipal cot-
tages in his crowded ward was so high that
the estimated rental was 355. per week, and
he got so far as to advocate contract work.
He was brought up short; but, that he
might retreat gracefully, guarding the
interests of his constituents to the last,
the estimated rental for each day-labor
cottage was reduced to 28s. They could
just as easily have made it Bs. even if the
reality proves to be 40s.
The Yic. Railways Magazine says the
carriage of road metal represents about 20 per
cent, of the total goods traffic of the Depart-
ment. One further learns that “the estimated
loss on metal carried at the special-shire-coun-
cil i*ate amounts to £90,000 a year. In other
words, a backstairs gift is made by the State
to the shire councils of £90,000 a year. Isn’t
it about time all these surreptitious subsidies
were abolished?
“D. Pug": Judges and magistrates are
occasionally heard telling a woman that she
must disclose her age in answer to a direct
question, but the Queensland Labor Govern-
ment is more chivalrous —or something. Be-
neath the space for “year of birth” on the
enrolment-card, one finds in brackets: “This
information is optional in the ease of
females.” Evidently the Government is fully
seized of the value of the woman’s vote.
The “art-union” craze has hit Maoriland
almost as hard has hit her big sister,
and the Dominion’s laws have been circum-
vented by taking advantage of a quaint legal
decision that a mineral specimen is a work
of art. The winner of the first prize, there-
fore, can usually have) the option of taking
a gold nugget valued at something or
other or a cheque for the same amount. The
Government hasn't worried much about it
until recently, when a proposal was made
to start a £1,000,000 raffle to build a bridge
over Auckland Harbor —a sort of counter-
blast to Sydney’s steel rainbow. The notion
was to offer £200,000 worth of prizes, use
£50,000 for promotion expenses, and build
the bridge with the remaining three-quarters
of a million. The next thing that happened
was an announcement that the Government
intended to introduce legislation to put the
lid on all art unions that don’t strictly live
up to their label.
From a New York cablegram :
The chief city magistrate, Mr. McAdoo, in a
letter speaking for the law officials throughout the.
country, asked Senators Moses and Butler to facili-
tate the passage of a bill prohibiting the sending
of pistols through the mails.... Mr. McAdoo stated
there were more people shot to death or wounded
by pistols in one year in the United States than in
all the rest of the w0r1d.... There were more young
outlaws in the United States between the ages of
16 and 26 whose aim was to get easy money
through the use of a pistol and motor-car than in
all the rest of the world.
There is generally an “evangelist” from the'
land of pistols, bootlegging, chewing-gum and
12,000 murders per annum wandering around
Australia. At present there are two, and
one of them lias been very uncivil, in a
raucous sermon, about the Australian habit
of smoking.
The question whether aldermen have any
sense of humor has been definitely settled as
far as Sydney’s City Council is concerned.
A Reformer called a Laborite a liar, arid the
latter hurled back the accusation embellished
with a bla'nky. My lord in the chair sternly
ordered the contestants, as they readied the
stage of sparring up to each other, not
to “lower the Council’s dignity.” Both sat
down, and not a smile illumined the alder-
manic ehivs.
FOG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Ideal fog-producing conditions are still at work.”
—Weather report.
Fog fills the utmost corners of the world.
All Europe walks in narrowing circles round;
And ever since the battle flags were furled
You scarce can see six yards of open ground.
France is befogged in vapors of the franc
That melts to gaseous essence out of sight;
The little nations wonder what they drank
That makes them look to left and walk to right.
The Kaiser’s millions cloud the German eyes;
And over Italy a heavy pall
That makes all shirts look black shuts out the skies
Where Mussolini still declines to fall.
America is lost beyond return
Between -strange mists of wetness law makes dry
And ruddy lights of rum that glow and burn
To guide the eager gun-man’s wandering eye;
And Britain, with the ball right at her feet,
Fumbles in strange miasmas of unrest,
Where coal unworked gives forth a burning heat
Of argument to spoil the Cricket Test.
A muddled world it is; and ships that fain
Would take a clear course listen for the bell,
Afraid to move, unable to remain
In one sure spot and know that all is well.
It may be that the sun will lift the mist
On some clear morning; but as things go now
AVho knows what fatal turn or foolish twist
May bump our stern or smash our shrouded prow ?

That record profit—£92,B74 greater than
for the previous term —at once indicates the
bank’s remarkable strength and the present
prosperity of Maoriland. Certainly there
was an extra £1,125,000 of new capital at
work for the full term, but that did not
earn more than 5£ p.c. gross—the rate at
which it has been advanced to the M.L. Gov-
ernment for a period of 10 years. As a
bonus of 1 p.c. on “B” prefs. and ordinaries
is spoken of for next term, the management
will have to find a nice wad for the new
capital additional to what it is itself bring-
ing in. It is not likely that the task will
cause anybody many sleepless nights. When
the £1,125,000 was asked for —it represented
the last of the authorised £6.154,988 —share-
holders were warned by the board to cancel
any hopes of gifts, so the prospective 1 p.c.
is one of those pleasant shocks which help
to make us feel that things might be a lot
worse. And bank bonuses have an affable
habit of becoming fixtures, too. Despite the
heavy premiums demanded on new issues in
the earlier years of the great recovery, share-
holders have had a rich time, a 50 p.c. gift
distribution in 1921 being the star item
in. a brilliant performance. Having bright-
ened the annual meeting with hopes of a
bonus, chairman George Elliott stated that
a long-term loan department was to be
created with a special capital of £1,406,250,
and with power to raise debentures to three
times that amount. Loans would be at 6
p.c., currency not more than 364 years, with
a div. on the special capital of 74 p.c. Keen
handling of that captal will be essential if
the department is to lean on itself instead
of on the general banking. As in the case
of the last move in capital this indicates the
Government influence. At least the Govern-
ment shows wisdom in placing some of its
most difficult work on the shoulders of one
of the most dependable institutions in the
Dominion. But Maorilanders wfill have to
pull up on private expenditure—much of it
extravagance—if they are to retain the
strength of recent years. Last year exports
were £6,073,571 less, yet imports increased
by £3,204,761 —a very disquieting adverse
trade balance of £4,328,269, which ought to
be corrected by Tariff adjustments. A little
attention to luxuries alone would go a good
way towards evening things up.
The Government has, of course, shared in
the bank’s opulence. Its portion of the 1921
gift scrip ran to £375,000. Of the full capi-
tal it holds £500.000 of “A” prefs. (10 p.c.
non-cum.) ; £1,375,000 of “B” prefs. (under
an arrangement based on 1920 distributions
these receive the same as the ordinaries so
long as profits keep above £356,250) ; and
£529,988 of guaranteed stock. The last is
the remnant of the two millions issued by
“King Dick” Seddon to save the bank when
things were tottering in the ’nineties. The
B.N.Z. does not function as the Common-
wealth Bank of Australia does under the
recent alterations, but it is interesting - to
note that the M.L. Government extracted
last year £212,464 in divs. and a large plate-
ful of taxes (the rates and taxes paid were
£354,882), whereas the net direct return to
the Federal Government from the Common-
wealth Bank was £125,704 to the national
debt sinking fund and nothing in taxes. True,
the Australian Note Issue Department
showed profits of £724.890, of which £598,700
went direct to the Federal Treasury; and
whereas it was hard cash that the M.L.
Government invested, the Commonwealth
subscribed no capital at all to its great in-
stitution. Talk of complete purchase of the
B.N.Z. by the Maoriland Government has
died away, and the loan of £1,125,000 (the
new capital) in 1925 to the Government for
the use of the Advances to Settlers’ Department
and the move now forecasted screw down
the lid. There never was much to commend
the scheme, for the amount involved in
recent times would have been such as to limit
the possible annual return for many years.
Gross profits disclosed last year were
greater than the bloated figures of 1921:

‘Less provision for contingencies.
Taxation was lighter, and exes., although
greater, were kept within proportion. Each
year sees extension of activities, but more
than half of last year's increase in gross in-
come would be accounted for by the earn-
ings of the new capital, which was at work
for the full period. A sum of £lOO,OOO, being
“part of provision previously made for anti-
cipated loss on transfer of surplus funds
from London and not now required,” was
written into p. and 1.; that represents profits
earned over the several years when exchange
difficulties were resulting in troublesome accu-
mulations in London. The disclosure of that
amount is significant: it is evident that the
management is thoroughly satisfied with the
existing provision for contingencies, notwith-
standing the inflated value of land and the
weakness of the freezing industry. Only
two years ago £184,465 was brought to light,
some needs or dangers having passed, and
that is an additional assurance. And there
is the forecasted increase in the div. to stress,
the fact still further.

1926.. 26,482,848 22,662,697 484,103
Exceptional strength is disclosed there. For
instance, the bank’s total visible funds at
March 31 amounted to £9,545,366, while out-
side liabilities aggregated £39,287,471. Thus
for every £1 of its own money it held only
£4 2s. 4d. of the public’s. Although deposits
were heavier, they still were more than 6|
millions less than those held in the record
year, 1920. Moreover, despite an increase of
£2,000,000-odd in advances, the proportion
of outside liabilities represented by liquids
was 67.4 p.c. The balance, £12,804,623, was
covered by advances in the books at
£22,662,697, and premises written down to
£484,103 —far below their true value. With
the exception of the freezers and the smaller
woollen industry, Maoriland is enjoying re-
markable prosperity. The trouble is that,
on this foundation, a big section of the
primary producers—and M-L. is essentially
a primary producer—are building castles.
Which means that the financial houses, and
particularly the banks, have to do double
duty in watching the future. It is unlikely
that the B.N.Z. will under-estimate the pos-
sibilities.

The reserves are described as nominal be-
cause there is £114.500 of goodwill among the
assets. On the other side there is £89,711
set aside for taxation ; and it looks as though
that includes something for contingencies.
For the past year disclosed net. profits were
£12,589 better than in 1925, which more than
paid the div. on the capital got in from the
final calls on the 154.743 new ordinaries
issued in the previous year. The profit was
so handsome that only two-thirds of it was
mopped up by the 10 p.c. handed to share-
holders. That, however, was only one facet
of the sparkling gem. Consider these figures :
1924. 1925. 1926.
Liabilities .. .. £87,507 £41,472 £46,919
Land and buildings . . 206,067 196,026 186,836

Book debts . . . . 127,901 134,113 160,743
Cash, investments, etc. 18,816 98,643 324,430
The directors don’t say how 7 much profit they
put aw 7 ay to cover depreciation, etc.; but it
may be significant that buildings appear at
no less than £14.800 under the figure of the
previous March, while machinery and plant
are £61,380 under. Naturally, in these cir-
cumstances, the liquid position has become
fat if not bloated. For instance :
1925. 1926.
Cash £3,343 £6,264
Deposits 57,902 127,647
Commonwealth Stock* . . . . 30,293 50,834
Shares and interest in other cos... 7,105 139,685
*44 p.c., 1925 ; 51 p.c., 1926.
Meantime payments on the contribs. (£75
unpaid at March 31) brought in £50,374, and
stocks decreased by £40,000; on the other
hand, book debts were £25,000 greater. It
is plain that the co. had a very rich year.
The large increase in the shareholdings re-
presents the co.’s interest in Crown Crystal
Glass, which w r as registered in N.S.W, in
January last with a capital of £200,000. Aus-
tralian Glass obtained control of Crystal and
merged it and the Crown —wdiich it owned —
into the new co. The subsidiary will bend
its efforts to increase production of flint-
w r are—including tumblers and table glass—
the improved tariff inducing the expansion.
Now that the higher duty on sheet-glass is
assured —there was some opposition in the
Senate a few 7 days ago, but the item was
passed by 22 votes to s—the5 —the way is clear
for the launching of what should prove to bo
a notable addition to Australian industry.
The capital raised from the issue of the new
ords. was for this purpose. At the time it
w r as stated that the co. was in a position
to make a prompt start; it' held the Aus ;
tralian rights of one of the latest processes
and the necessary technical experts had been
arranged for by director W. J. Smith during
his European visit. As the new tariff is to
operate immediately, it is not likely that the
co. has been idle in the matter. There was
plenty of money within easy reach at March
31 to simplify the financing of this new
department. Experiments in shorter work-
ing weeks and workers’ compensation will
not make the beginning easy, but the Tariff
Board granted a fair measure of Protection,
although it added a caution that it was
working somewhat in the dark, and would
watch the effect of its decision.
At March 31 liabilities were covered sev-
eral times over by liquids. The 175,000 9
p.c. profs, could see net tangibles amounting
to £1,301,486, equal to £7 Bs. 9d. per share.
The co. obviously is doing even better than
its accounts claim, but a concern which is
pioneering a field new to Australia does
right in building up strength to meet the con-
tingencies of keener competition from foreign
products and experimental or punitive legis-
lation from local politicians.

Unkind weather conditions interfered with
this salt farm in 1925, but shareholders w r erc
given 74 p.c. and the balance of profit was
used in writing off. Last year’s trouble, which
produced an actual loss, appears to be more
serious than the weather —vigorous competi-
tion, mainly from local concerns. The foreign
product isn’t much bother these days,
although table-salt still figures far too. largely
among our imports. During the term there
was a revival of activity amongst Australian
producers, chiefly S. Australian and Vic-
torian. and there was more than ordinary
keenness in the hunt for business. Latest
news is of a Queensland co. to exploit
the salt possibilities of the tidal flats
near Bowen. Given production at reason-
able costs such a co. will add still further to
the difficulties of existing concerns, for freight
advantages should give it a grip on a big
part of the Northern State. The best if not
only chance of improvement for Castle Balt
under normal conditions in the field seems to
be the one which the management intends to
explore: alterations and additions to plant to
reduce costs. “Better selling prices" are, bf
course, hoped for; but this is a rickety peg
unless the co. sees possibilities of an agree-
ment as to prices and markets amongst pro-
ducers. Something like that is aimed at and
talked about; but thus far the Australian is
a poor hand at this sort of thing, lie is
much better at price-cutting than price-
fixing ; and while he gets nothing out of it
himself, it is very doubtful whether the com-
munity gains anything in the long run.
The co.’s position still looks all right from
this angle:—
1923 1924. 1925. 1926.
Stocks .. . . £31,695 £26,654 £29,633 £39,220

Liabilities .. 8,011 4,493 5,444 22,185
Liquid surplus. . £28,146 £28,259 £26,756 £22,114
But everything depends on the value at which
the stocks—3o p.c. heavier than the previous
year—were taken into account. With the
market in such a condition as-to show a loss
on the year’s work, only pessimism should
have governed the pencil which compiled the
stock-sheets. Unless that was so the liquid
surplus may not turn out to be what it seems.
Total liabilities increased ; trading debts at
£1862 were £2195 lighter, but overdraft
moved from £3908 to £20,321. The co. has
mostly seen the future bathed in sunshine
and distributed profits liberally, whereas the
susceptibility of earnings to melt should have
been a warning to provide against grey days.
Actually, when a few thousands of surplus
profits were found on the premises in various
forms six years ago, they were whacked up
with unseemly haste. Yet reserves were never
more than nominal, an unspecined amount of
goodwill lurking in the fixed assets —“Free-
holds, leaseholds, plant, goodwill, livestock and
rolling stock, £52,853.” The projected econo-
mies are necessary; but with them in opera-
tion, the co. should still have a future. None
of its competitors at any rate have any over-
whelming natural advantages.

1926.. 8033 10 p.c. = 4000 4033 5,099
On the whole the Hume cos. have not come
up to the high expectations formed of them;
but this little one of the family has done
very well in its foifr years. While shareholders
have not been starved, consistent attention has
been given to the reduction of goodwill items,
which have been carved down from £19,168
to £lO,OOO. Last year less than half the
profit was distributed; earnings were excel-
lent considering the limited field of
operations. The matter of extending to other
points is still “receiving close consideration,”
but there is less definite talk on this occa-
sion. When 1925 accounts were presented
shareholders were warned that it might be
necessary to call up the remaining ss. on
the 40,000 contribs., but the directors now
think that it may be possible to hold off
until the co. steps into Java or elsewhere.
Orders in hand are sufficient to keep the
three “factories” busy to the end of Sep-
tember; further contracts are in the air, and
the co. thinks a castle or two might be built
on the Singapore naval base. At March 31
creditors totalled £7205; against that there
were cash, £6454, and book debts amounting
to £2199, with stocks, deposits on contracts,
and contracts in progress totalling £13,395.
Land, buildings, plant, etc., were in the
books at £21,220. Depreciation is not speci-
fied, but machinery, plant and buildings
appear at £2387 less than the previous year,
although “land, at cost, £3430” is a new
item. The position appears to be satisfac-
tory, but very much depends upon whether
the co. can continue to make profitable use
of its plant. That sort of asset isn’t worth
much apart from what it can earn.

It is much more difficult than it used to

GUTHRIDGE LIMITED, 10 George Street, Camperdown, Sydney.
The River Transport iCo., Ltd., is a Bris-
bane float. Nominal capital is £250,000 in ss.
shares; 500.000 offered for subscription;
40,000 paids to the vendor; 460,000 reserved.
The chief object is to establish passenger
services on various Australian waterways,
commencing with the Brisbane River. Figures
are based, so far as capital expenditure, pro-
fits, running costs and depreciation are con-
cerned, entirely on Diesel-driven boats,
although the supplementary prospectus states
that the co. will take over other launches,
“some the usual slower wooden boats.” The
vendor (M. F. Torazzi) receives his 40,000
fully-paids as consideration for a franchise
obtained from the Greater Brisbane Council,
which gives running rights for 20 years over
a northern stretch of the Brisbane River,
and for liis plans and data. The co. may
operate down-stream under license, and
almost 50 p.c. of the estimated profits come
from the southern area. The co.’s articles
mention that Mr. Torazzi is to be managing
director for five years, although his name
does not so appear in the abridged and sup-
plementary prospectuses. Brisbane's popula-
tion is scattered over a wide area, and only
thinly along the serpentine river. San
Francisco and Sydney Harbor ferry figures
are therefore no measure for fair compari-
sons, for both are thickly-populated along
and back from the waterfront, and both lack
the facilities for cheap bridging which almost
every reach of the Brisbane offers. There
may be a case for a big co. to handle ferry
business on the Brisbane “and various Aus-
tralian waterways,” but the investor who
does not kuow Brisbane will be slow to con-
sider the proposition and the local investor
will want much more than general remarks
and the good wishes of prominent citizens.

Australian Rubber Co., Ltd., has a
nominal capital of £250,000 in £1 shares;
72,000 offered for subscription, 281000 fully-
paids to vendors, 150,000 in reserve. Hold-
ers of the first issue will have rights in sub-
sequent issues. The co. is to acquire from
a syndicate certain options over a rubber-
composition applicable to road-paving blocks,
floor coverings, motor disc-wheels and cer-
tain secret processes. The composition is a
mixture of cork, sawdust or other material
with rubber, which is vulcanised. The
quality of the products is undoubted, and the
costs as shown to The Bulletin such as
to permit of business in competition with
similar products made of other materials.
The disc motor-wheel may not, however,
prove an easy proposition to market. There
appear to be possibilities in the “secret com-
position” if patents can be obtained and pro-
duction costs are within reason. Cash re-
ceived from the 72.000 shares is to be used:
Land, building and plant, £44,500; cash to
vendors, £2000: preliminary exes.. £9700;
leaving £15,500 for working capital. Esti-
mates of profits are based on the rubber-
composition goods, and the figures carry the
endorsement of accountants 11. B. Allard,
Way and Hardie. Chief point on which in-
vestors need to satisfy themselves is the co.’s
capacity to win the amount of business on
which the estimates are based.

Mararoa (W.A.) is languishing from want
of capital. Chairman Henderson told share-
holders that ore in sight was 33,000 tons
valued at 41s. 9d., and the cost of treat-
ment should not exceed 30s. —roughly
£16,000 profit. The shaft is only 200 ft. deep,
and at that depth the lode is Bft. wide. A
recent development at No. 1 level* showed
an average width of reef of Oft. 6in. worth
60s. a ton. This looks like being a good
small mine : yet the directors are driven to
seek a further Government grant to help
them erect a new plant. It show? how dis-
inclined investors are to put nioney into
Australian mines. There is, on the other
hand, any amount available for Malaya.
* * * *
Golden Horseshoe (W.A,), which recently
announced values up to 60s. a ton, and a
ago spread similar reports along with
the statement that over half a million tons
of ore was in sight, has decided to liquidate.
The State Government, which was induced to
advance the co. £50,000 until some of the
ore mentioned could be raised and treated,
now reckons that there must he something
wrong with the law that permits a mining co.
to pay away millions in. dividends without
building up a reserve fund, get assistance
from the State to “tide over an unpayable
period” and then impudently wind up. In
all probability the Government as mortgagee
will foreclose and put .Tack Sutherland, the
manager, in charge.

Perth (W.A.) was booming two gold dis-
coveries a few months ago which were said
to be in entirely new country. The Bul-
letin now has before it reports by Mines
Department officials on both. One at Mundi
Windi, on the road to Marble Bar, is de-
scribed as quite undeveloped but of good
appearance, while the other, in the s.-e.
corner of the Yalgoo goldfields, is considered
to have no prospects at all. It is thought,
however, that the surrounding country might
be worth the attention of prospectors.

Melbourne speculators, have optioned some-
thing at Ki rnalpi (W.A.), which is reported
to have a fair-sized gold deposit. Thirty
years ago Kurnalpi was one of the biggest
alluvial diggings in the West, but the reefs
were poor, and when the dryblower had fin-
ished its glory soon departed. In recent
times only fossickers have earned a pre-
carious living there.
Last stage of the Nakon flutter is that
W. T. Anderson coufirms other reports that
he lias dropped thp block which was to go
from the New Salak South to Nakon. The
cold fact is that hillsides cannot be sluiced
into rivers, and although there are 400 acres
of shallow drift, it isn’t good enough for
anyone save the Chinese. After all it looks
as if the New Salak South has a better
chance than Nakon, to which the Pratt-
Meagher party still cling.

Bux is trying hard to live. It has swung
off oil back to tin in the hope of better
luck. than it had in the bad Badak days.
Finance then was not its strong point, and
it is not certain that it has done great things
m respect to its new venture. However, it
is to have a 12 months’ spin for no cash.
The district is Trengganau, Malaya, and it
is not the first time that it has been on the
bill. J. Joice is the holder of a title there.
His demand is that if the option to his lease
be exorcised before the end of 12 months, his
party is to have 20*p.c. of any shares-in the
co. to take over the option. But that is
not everything. He is to carry out boring
at a salary of £lOOO. also exes, and 100 fully
paid £25 shares in the Bux itself directly it
agrees to start operations. If Joice has
located a good claim the terms are not
excessive. The area is eight square miles in
extent and was found by Joice, juq.
.Tclapang Tin Dredging, just added to the
official list of Sydney Exchange, has a capital
of £120,000, of which £55,000 is fully paid,
the balance contributing. The co.’s area,
which is a mile or two from Ipoli (F.M.S.),
is .330 acres, with an average depth of 38
feet. A. P. Penman estimates 20 million
vards, of which nine millions is lib. ground
and the remainder .71b. ground. The bucket
dredge should be shipped in July and reach
the. site by September; but recent experience
with bucket-dredge erection indicates it will
be about a 3 7 ear before the whistle blows.
Shares' have a very good market in the East,
and Australian holdings are gradually being
absorbed.

Burma Malay is a Sydney-subscribed pros-
pecting co., capital £30,000; Eric Mulligan
managing director. Mulligan was head of
Austral Malay's prospecting staff, and bored
Thabawleik, of which he became general man-
ager, later resigning to form a prospecting
company of his own. A lot of likely-looking
country has been turned down by Burma
Malay, but reports say that a property
adjoining the recently-prospected Austral
Malay area in Western Siam shows great pro-
mise. It is said that the East has lately been
buying at about 445.

- Kampong Ivamunting (F.M.S.), after
deducting depreciation and amortisation
dues, netted £51.721 last year, compared
with £63,454 in 1.924; but the co. distributed
its Asam Kumbang holding during the term,
and so received no revenue from that source.
Operating two dredges, the co. treated
1.899,000yd5. for 646 tons oxide, or just over
fflb. ground. The 140,000 shares got Bs. in
divs., and a balance of £2982 was carried
forward, against £7261 brought in. The co.
completed the purchase of the small Karan-,
gan property in Kedah from the Austral
Malay, and anticipates dismantling and re-
erecting No. 1 dredge there after finishing
at Ivamunting village in 1928. To keep the
div. distribution on an even keel, the co. will
set aside portion of the proceeds from rich
ground now being worked, as a fund against
the nine months or so of idleness when the
dredge is being shifted. No. 2 dredge con-
tinues on stony ground and keeps about its
lOoz. average.
» # * *
Ulu Yam (F.M.S.), working ground just
over half a pound, recovered 316 tons oxide
for 1925 from 1,344,000yd5., showing a net
return of £16,128 against £22,077 in 1924.
With £3622 brought in the co. had £19,750
at credit, of which divs. amounting to 2s. 6d.
a share absorbed £12,500, £4083 went in
writing'down development, and £3167 went
forward. The area has been to
592 acres by acquisition of 60 acres of fib.
ground. The dredge will be in better ground
during the current year, but the rate of div.
is not likely to be lifted much, if anything.
Better things are looked for 1927: but that
is a good way off where the tricky tin
market is concerned.
* * * ■*
' Thabawleik (Burma), a popular pick as
one of the promising things in the Austral
Malay stable, makes light of the capital
which has gone out during the long waif for
tin oxide. At the end of 1925 the co. had
expended £22,016 in excess of its cash re-
sources, “and this total will be further in-
creased before production begins.” Produc-
tion being now tipped for the end of August
at the earliest, the “further increase” in the
debit at p. and 1. seems certain, as the
“Wild Cat” mentioned before, to incur a
mortgage. over the first 300 tons of oxide at
least. “Once production has begun, the
directors assure holders, “it will not take
long to retire all liabilities.” Still the scrip
ife not under-valued at the ruling rate of s_s.

Holders of the 80,000 shares in Bundi
(F.M.S.) received the unwelcome news last
w r eek that the July and October divs. need
not be expected. No. 2 dredge for the
Cheneh Valley area has to be provided for,
and No. 1 has not been recovering anything
near the estimate. At 30 tons a month the
directors might have kept divs. going and
wrestled with the financing of No. 2, but No.
1 “fell short of expectations to the equiva-
lent of £9OOO” —more than the amount re-
quired for the two shilling divs. “A belt
of extremely tough, clayey and shingly
ground” is blamed for the short weight, but
the previous dredging history of the co. was
a lament about submerged timber. A. W'.
Freeman has been over, and certifies that the
property is being well managed and erection
of No. 2 dredge proceeding satisfactorily.
Everything, apparently, is O.K. except the
yields, which have never flattered the author
of the prospectus.

Having reached 1160 ft. New Guinea Oil
Co. suspends boring for a month during the
process of - reaming, setting and cementing
the casing prior to an examination of the
gas and oil struck at 1150 ft. There was a
slight burst of activity in the shares last
week, buyers offering 13s. 6d., with sellers
holding for 20s. at the close on Saturday.
On Monday the market had settled to b. 165.,
s. 17s. 6d. There was buying in Landers (Q.),
but" the price broke on selling orders. It is
fairly obvious that some of the oil cos. are
fiddling about waiting for something to turn
up and allow holders to unload. Oil may
belfound iri New Guinea —geological condi-
tions are kind—but the discovery in one spot
dqes not imply similar success everywhere.
Investors are likely to be bitten unless they
absorb that obvious fact.

Asam Kumbang (F.M.S.) found 1925 a
lean year, under lOoz. ground being operated
in taking 353 tons oxide from 1,331,000yd5.
The net profit (£20,082)- was £27,403 below
the 1924 figure, when the co. worked in a
rich gutter. With £3294 brought in, the
directors had £23,376 available, and £22,500
went in paying 4s. 6d. in divs. on the 100,000
shares. The dredge has passed out of the
low-grade ground, “and will, continue for
some years in what may be regarded as the
body of the mine.” The ground before, the
dredge is of 14|oz. average to a depth of
30ft., and the directors figure on Bs. to 10s.
in divs. for 1926. Shares keep above 60s.

Austral Malay's holdings turned in £10,653
in divs. for 1925, as against £17,302 in 1924.
The appropriation account was swelled to
£21,627 by adding the profit on sale of the.
co. s Karangan area. Holders of the 100,000
20s. shares received 2s. in divs., £1796 went
to general depreciation, and £9831 remained
to carry forward. During the year the co.
acquired 21,400 20s. shares from its Puchong
float, raising its holdings in otner cos. to a
face value’of £113,025. Reserves have risen
to £17,457. prospecting account is reduced
from £15,456 to £269, and cash balances
increased from £lB2B to £20,242 by selling
off F.M.S. war-loan stocks. The new area
at Pungkah, near Tongkah Hai’bor, Siam,
receives a favorable notice, the view being
expressed that! s "the high figure demanded for
it is warranted.

An inquiring soul has asked the British
Consul in Batavia the facts about titles of
oil lands in the Dutch East Indies. What
he says won't bring cheers from the boom-
sters who talk so much about concessions.
There never has been any Dutch opposition
to anyone having a prospecting right and
testing country, but to secure a safe title later
on is another thing. To-day the first thing
is to get on the soft side of the Governor-
General. That means a personal talk. Then
the local Parliament has to be induced to
pass a bill. If that hurdle is surmounted the
last and worst jump is to have the conces-
sion ratified by the Second Chamber in Hol-
land. That is not easy. Even then the keen
Dutch insist that the East Indies Govern-
ment shall shax;e profits. Nothing is said
about the expense of it all. Pearson, who
has planted an option with the Mararoa.
says that his vineyard has a sound title,
granted before the present arrangement was
fixed. If so he is lucky. As he is working
with E. M. di Yilla, who knows the East
like a book, his sailing in Dutch waters may
be safe.

“Gregor”: There has been revived the
story of an enormously rich. reef said to
exist somewhere in the jungle between the
Warriar and Markham Rivers. A year or
so before the war it was stated in Papua
that the Germans—then the owners of the
territory—had discovered These state-
ments were given color by the fact that for
some time prospecting had been prohibited in
the region in which the reef was believed to
be, and where German exploring parties had
been at work for several years. Also, in
the early days of the war, there was captured
at Capetown an enemy ship laden with min-
ing machinery and batteries for Rabaul. It
is probable that if there really is such a
reef a few Australians deprived their coun-
trymen of all knowledge of its location by
their destruction of maps and charts in
Rabaul, just after the military occupation.
The Germans were desperately anxious to
get hold of these documents, and some Aus-
tralian officers, who were ignorant of Ger-
man, and believed the papers to be of no
importance, had them burned. After the
peace a former official confided that amongst
them were maps showing the position of the
reef and the quickest route to it.

The star of Adams River osmiridium dig
gings (Tas.) is setting, most of the good
claims having been worked out. Production
of the white metal lias decreased by more
than one-half during the past few months,
and there are now barely 300 men on the
field. Some of the old hands set high hopes
on the big serpentine outcrop on the Jane
River, 45 mik's n.-w. of the field, and several
expeditions are being planned for that region
next summer. The Jane is inaccessible in
winter owing to snow and flooded rivers.

the dry weather, wasn’t more than a trickle.
Here the little wonder kept her charges from
catching alight by pouring water over them ;
and finally she nearly stripped herself to
cover the others. The nervous strain
on her must have been tremendous. Eight
days after the occurrence I talked with some
of the adults who went through much the
same experience, and they were then only
just pulling themselves together after the
reaction.
"Valimanbag” : The usual mysterious work-
ings of luck, good or bad, were disclosed
after the railway smash at Aberdeen.
A Sydney man had reserved a berth in the
sleeper that suffered the most damage. At
the last moment he cancelled it—the man
who took his place was killed. A man and
woman passed.from the fatal carriage to an
undamaged one two or three minutes before
the disaster. Marie Burke and Warde
Morgan, of the "Katja” company, were
among the unlucky ones. At Newcastle they
got a re-allotment of berths and changed to
a carriage which was smashed to matchwood
from one which never left the rails. Five
minutes before the disaster Warde Morgan
invited several members of the co. to his
compartment for a game of cards. Being
tired they asked to be excused. There were
some passengers who slept through the whole
occurrence. They were awakened by officials
four or five hours after the smash and told
to change trains. One bright little girl,
after crawling out of the compartment next
to the one in which her cousin was killed
and her aunt badly damaged, found herself
sitting alongside the line with several other
"rattled” passengers. She recalls now some
remarks about the .carelessness of Railway
Commissioners, and she distinctly remembers
that she .turned to the man next her and
slapped his face—she knew that somebody
was at fault, and she couldn’t think past
him. He must have been the most surprised
man in Aberdeen.

duly secured a decree. On the other side
of the ledger there is in Sydney a Digger who
is living quite happily with a woman who
used to be his mother-in-law. When her
daughter eloped with another man, she came
in to look after the children and housekeep;
and after a divorce had been secured the
Digger married his ex-wife’s mother. The
union, whether strictly legal or riot, has
been perfectly happy.

-“Si Aim" : If anything conies of the sug-
gestion of an English Parliamentarian that
elephants should be introduced into W.A.,
that rather empty countryside should become
more interesting. Jumbo is a patient and
useful beast, but he has his moods. In
Kedah, Malay States, one of the royal ele-
phants selected the highroad between Kedah
aud Siam as a
lying-in hospital,
while the bull
stood by to look
after the family’s
interests. As the
lying-in lasts about
a fortnight, and
an y interference'
with the pair pro-
bably would have
resulted in the de-
struction of the
capital, engineers
diverted the road.
A couple of months
ago in India two
huge beasts started
fighting over a
lady. The . duel
was heard afar off
in the hills', and
presently the con-
testants were seen
to be descending

nightfall they were
on the outskirts of

“The Deacon": The’number of people who
vanish unaccountably in Sydney is ha'rd to
estimate. On one recent morning a Judge
was asked to pronounce three such men to
be legally dead. Two were brothers who
had failed to return from a fishing excur-
sion, and little doubt about their fate was
possible. The other case was that of a
highly respectable citizen living in conjugal
felicity who was asked by his wife to stop
on his way to the office and send a doctor
along to see one of his family. That was
seven years ago, and no trace of him has
ever been seen by the family since. Advts.,
handbills, published photos and a reward
were all employed in vain. The Judge made
the desired order. Over 20 years ago a
King-street (Sydney) tobacconist - in a large
way of business .put on his hat one night
about seven o'clock and, telling the wife
he was merely going for a stroll round the
block, disappeared into thin air and stayed
there. Yet it isn't always safe to presume
that the vanished ones are dead. There was
the case of an engineer employed at Botany
who disappeared from the bosom of his
family and his eldest son with him. Fifteen
years later the missing pair were identified
in S’Africa.
“Kerys”: Massey, Maoriland's longtime
Premier, had a war story that concerned a
visit to the trenches. When he went with
Ward to represent the M.L. coalition in
London, part of the programme was a run
over to France, and the pair* on arrival
were handed over, with about half a dozen
other celebrities, to a young British officer
who was to personally conduct them. The
procession filed along a disused trench.
“Two hundred Germans were captured here,”
whispered the guide. Massey, next in order,
Whispered the information to Ward, and the
whisper went down the line. “This is where
00 of our boys were blown up," was the
next cheerful item, and, that too. duly went
whispering along. After half a dozen husky
announcements Massey sought a little addi-
tional information. “How far away is the
enemy now V" he murmured. “Fifteen miles”
was the reply. “Then,” shouted Massey in
his best Parliamentary manner, “what the
devil are you whispering aboutV" The young
officer looked aggrieved. “I’ve just had ton-
silitis,” he said; “that’s why I’m out oi:
the- line.”
“Roycha” : A Romeo with a suggestion of
Raffles about him has just left a N. S. Wales
South Coast town for Coulburn gaol.
Arriving allegedly from England, with tin-
usual vague stories about high and wealthy
family connections, he soon began philander-
ing with all the ardor of a Valentino, and in
a month was engaged to the prettiest girl
in the place. The girl was enraptured.
Her “intended” showered presents upon her

soon he was gbing strong - with another young
lady of infinite charm. She, too, received
bagfuls of presents and was having rosy
dreams of the future when the cold hand
of the law Hopped upon the young gent, s
shoulder. The story came out in the police-
court a week later. Romeo-Raffles had stolon
the iewels and other presents given to lus
first inamorata, and then stolen them hack
from her to give to the second.
"Hannibal Swordfish": The University
commemoration procession at Hobart was
banned by the authorities this year, so the
humor of the undergrads, had to find some
other outlet. High on a hill overlooking the
city, and visible for miles, is an advertise-
ment in huge letters formed of large whit-
ened rocks and making the words “Keen's
Curry." The day after commem., citizens, on
happening to glance aloft, rubbed their eyes
and grinned or shuddered, as the case might
be, at the discovery that the writing on the
wall had been changed to a gigantic “Hell s
Curse." The perpetrators of the profane jest
must have worked like beavers, for the altera-
tion of the letters meant shifting tons ot
boulders in the dark on a windswept hill.
“Sixcnate”: Family proneness to certain
physical disabilities is curious, but explicable
enough : liability to a special line in accident
is much less so. X. S. Wales lias one family
of which two members had been killed in rail-
way accidents when a third lost a leg in
still another railway smash. Finally the one-
legged survivor fell off a railway station in
front of a train and lost his life. I was
connected with a case arising from a brick
falling from a building and making a hope-
less paralvtic of a man who is the fourth of
his family to get in the way of falling sub-
stances. Two have been killed outright;
neither of them was engaged in building
operations. The sequence of fatalities in
some families by drowning or falls front
horseback may be explained by a family in-
clination for the sea or horses, combined
perhaps with a readiness to take risks ; and
an inherited lack of good balance may
account for slipping or falling accidents.
But it doesn't explain the full history.

The doors are locked, she’s strictly not at home.
Tn seereev she’s busy all the day
With basins, bottles, brushes and a comb:
None Knows, for none beholds the magic rite,
Kxaetly how these aids the end attain,
Put Grandma’s grizzled. locks, before the night,
Have somehow caught their youthful gold again.
Slim Grandma in a demi-semi-frock,
Nude stockings and a saucy little hat,
Gives Father Time the dickens of a knock—
Her ankles nearly send him to the mat.
He reels a little when he sees her mount
The ruddy lips and cheeks that flappers wear:
Hut poor old Time goes down and takes the count
When Grandmamma rejuvenates her hair.

“Detonator”: A Russian divvy was for
some obscure reason serving in the particular
sector of France where I was helping to win
the war. The Frogs issued them with
packets of ordinary leaf-tea, whereupon
the moujiks declared that it was not tea,
and protested against being expected to drink
tobacco. Ninety per cent, of the men had
never seen any other tea but that sold all
over Russia in small, compressed brick plugs ;
conversely, the only tobacco they’d seen was
the cut and shredded variety. Some enter-
prising Diggers grabbed the chance to sell
them plugs of tobacco for use in their cups;
but the entente cor diale got no extra cement
thereby.

“Retired Volt” : The public-spirited lessee
of a swimming-bath in Adelaide used annu-
ally to tour tlie schools, and, after painting
harrowing pictures of cases of drowning that
had occurred in the previous twelve months,
draw the moral that every child should be
taught to swim. There is a clear case for
similar propaganda to-day on the dangers
of the electric fluid. The number of the
ignorant who suffer the fate reserved in
U.S.A. for the worst criminals is increasing
as the opportunities for them to indulge
their recklessness increase. Not long ago
in Yic. a man joined the electric light
mains to his motor-car to make it spark,
with the inevitable result. A dozen workmen
were blissfully driving picks into masonry
within six inches of 20,000 volts in Mel-
bourne the o.uer day. A steamer in Sydney
hooked a power cable and brought it to the
surface. If it had been cut the entire crew
A LONG GTRETCH BACK.
"How old is she?”
“Just reached 20.”
“Lord, what an arm, she must have!”
would have gone aloft in a fine display of
pyrotechnics* The latest example comes
from Fishermen’s Bend (Yic.). A work-
man wagered he could climb to the top of
a tall standard carrying 25,000 volts across
the Yarra. He succeeded, but it was only
a charred remnant that was picked off the
wire and lowered to the ground on a rope.
* * * *
“H.J.” : You can’t persuade a Chinese sea-
man to handle the dead. I remember one
who, after a Chow passenger had died, was
invited by the doctor to lend a hand at
pickling the body (Chinese are never buried
at sea). He replied by diving for’ard in
such a hurry that he fell and nearly dis-
located his neck. The average Chinaman
believes tjrat should
lie touch a dead
man all the malig-
nant devils bottled
up in the body will
immediately jump
into him. The
superstition ex-
tends to ships. If
your junk cuts
across the stern of
another, all the
devils that have
b o e n streaming
after the latter
turn about and join
forces with your
o w n contingent,
while the other
craft, having lost
its issue, sails into
good weather and
evades pirates. This
idea is responsible
for a great many
collisions in Chi-
nese waters, every
junk manoeuvring
to head off another.
Again, when a man
is taking a walk
with the usual in-
visible company
ambling along be-
hind, and passes
under a temple
arch, he sheds his
devils instantly,
Hence you may see
many a miniature
temple in China.
The habit has
spread thence to
Western lands, and
is responsible for
the arch over the
suburban gateway
of many a smug
and orthodox suburban Christian in Aus-
tralia. although the occupant is probably
quite ignorant that he is humoring a Fagan
superstition.
* * * *
“0.J.": The idea of slogans is catching.
Melbourne’s Central Telephone Exchange is
using them to inspire Miss Number Flease
to greater effort. Monitors parade between
the switchboards and call out the day_s
pearl. “Use the nearest cord!” is a fair
sample. It seems to be a twin brother to
the one an annoyed telegraphist adopted some
years ago. Driven desperate by faulty sig-
nals Sparks called to the man at the other
end —“Try using the other foot!”
* * * *
“Splints": Rc the Sydney family of five
sisters whose limbs
are liable to break
at any moment (B.
17/6/’26). The
family (there can
hardly be two) ori-
ginally consisted of
nine sisters, three
o f wh o m died,
apparently, too
young to injure
themselves. Of the
remaining six, No.
1 broke her thigh
when she was over
00, and some time
in her seventies
she broke the other
limb. No. 2 frac-
tured her thigh at
the age of 71. No.
.Ts failed to re-
spond to treatment
when it fractured
during her eighties.
No. 4 fell a victim
to the family fail-
ing when she was
74. No. 5 broke
one thigh when she
was 76; ten years
later the other has
been fractured.
This she is nursing
in the same house
as N,o. 6. the youn-
gest of the family,
who is learning to
walk with crutches
at the age of 78
after following her sisters’ example.
* * * *
“Tarago” : Although the deposit was next
to nothing and payments light, nobody but
a land-hungry Digger would have taken
the block on. The improvements consisted
of a roofless two-roomed shack and about
10 acres of fern-grown clearing, but “Blue”
hopped into it with the enthusiasm of the
inexperienced, and managed to scratch in a
crop of oats. Then came disaster —a bush-fire
wiped out his haystack; and 1 went along to
cheer him up. He seemed in no way dashed
by the mishap. “You see,” he explained, “I
"ad th’ stack insured.” “But,” I said, “you
couldn’t insure it for its full value.”
“Well, I dunno about that,” he remarked.
SHE WASN’T VERY SPECULATIVE.
MISS BLUESTOCKING : “Does man's future ever interest you?”
MISS SILKSTOCKING : “ Not so much as his present—especially if
it’s in diamonds .”
“Y’see, I knew r nothin’ about buildin' stacks,
so I just piled the hay round th’ old shack.
The agent had a look and reckoned there was
40 ton there, and I let it go at that.”
“Yarragundry”: There were other Army
chestnuts every bit as hoary as the “Ha
ha! No shave?” yarn (B. 27/5/’6). One
which enjoyed a great vogue was the tale
of the Dig. who. pretending
to be “dopey,” kept assidu-
ously picking up scraps of
paper until handed his dis-
charge, which proved to be
the scrap he was seeking.
Both in Egypt and on Salis-
bury Plain I had the origi-
nal of the story pointed out
to me, or several of him.
Then, when convalescing in
T 7, I obtained a book from
the Red Cross Library called
“Incidents of the American
Civil .War.” The date was
ISOS, and again I came on
the serap-of-paper yarn. Even
then I suspect it had been
pirated from the time of the
Peninsular War, if, indeed,
the original paper-seeker
wasn't a Roman legionary.
* * *
“Centurion”: A 'bus was
badly missed by the officers
who attended the recent
Waterloo commemoration
dinner in Sydney. A Parra-
matta pawnbroker wrote to
the secretary that lie- had a
genuine Waterloo medal, and
would take £lO for it. The
letter was “greeted with
laughter,” and, apparently,
no business was done. Yet
the medal is one of the rarest
of English Army “souven-
eers,” for it was not issued
till over 30 years after the
battle, when most of those
entitled to it were dead. The
last one I heard of in England brought £7O
at Sotheby’s. There was another Waterloo
medal, a gold one. issued only to olficei-s of
high rank; these are well-nigh priceless.
* * * *
“Sixenate” : Pantomimes and penny comics
are largely responsible for the lack of appre-
ciation a man is supposed to feel for his
mother-in-law, but Sydney has supplied the
most implacable feudist encountered to date.
Differences arose between himself and his
wife which he attributed to the elderly
woman who had attached herself to the
household. Discovering that her dearest
sentimental wish was to be buried when she
died next to a dead daughter who had been
interred in the Manly Cemetery, he bought
up the neighboring allotment so as to prevent
its fulfilment. Nearly 20 years passed before
the old lady needed a grave. Her relatives
assumed that the old bitterness must long
have been forgotten, and laid her remains to
rest in the place of her choice. That was
live years ago. Recently the absent owner
(who has lived in Melbourne since liis sepa-
ration from his wife) made a trip to ►Sydney
and insisted upon the bones of the dead being
removed froth his property. A legal light
seemed likely, but the rights of the adamant
grave-owner were found to be unassailable.
An unattended grave plot reverts to the
cemetery trustees after 20 years, but the
burial had taken place three months before
the expiration of that period, so the musty
coffin was dragged out according to order.
* * * *
“Ellen Tommy”: A Melbourne agent for
Tatt.’s sent a book of tickets to a barber
at Lome (Vic.) one holiday season. The
barber shoved up the usual notice in his
window, where it attracted the attention of
the local parson, a worthy cleric who re-
garded gambling as one -of the deadliest or
sins. He preached a sermon in church on
the subject next Sunday, and it is at least a
tribute to his eloquence and liis influence
that the barber subsequently failed to sell
a single ticket to the outside public. Finding
himself with the book left on his hands, the
barber induced a couple of friends to share
the tickets with him. They collected £l2OO
apiece. Lome has never quite forgiven that
parson.
* * * *
“Crosshead": The story of the precious
radium that went astray at Auckland (B.
17/6/’26) recalls that some years ago a woman
attending the Adelaide hospital as an out-
patient was given a radium dressing for facial
trouble and was told to wait 20 minutes for the
element to act, the doctor attending to other
patients in the meantime. Misunderstanding
the instructions she returned to her lodgings,
and 20 minutes later there began a frantic
search for the lady and her dressing, valued
at hundreds of pounds. It took hours t<>
locate her, as she had come to Adelaide from
the country for treatment. And, incidentally,
by that time the over-exposure of the face
to the element had resulted in a severe radium
burn.
* * * *
“Huffin-Guffin”: Re the metal “tokens"
issued to supplement the scanty currency
of the early days (B. IT/<>/'26). When
our family moved into the even then
old out-station house on Fulham, near Bal-
moral (Vic.), in 1871). we boys searched
every nook and cranny of the place for
treasure-trove. Amongst odds and ends we
found several old Victorian “tokens,” some of
which 1 still have. One, dated 1858. bears
A.BUSY TIME AHOVE.
“Mummie, dear, do barbers go to Heaven?"
“I expect so, darling. [?]ut why do you ask that?"
“I expect they've bobbed all the angels and shaved the
saints by this time, then.”
the name of Hide and De Carle, “Grocers
and Wine Merchants, Elizabeth-street, Mel-
bourne/’ A figure of Justice with a pair
of scales forms the obverse. Another carries
the superscription : “J. Taylor, Red House.
Ballarat, Baker and Grocer.” On the other
side is a sheaf of wheat with “Advance Aus-
tralia, 1862,” encircling it. These tokens
are bronze and are of good workmanship.
But obviously they were not all issued be-
cause of the scarcity of copper coin : among
my collection is one stamped “Professor Hol-
loway, London, 1858,” and I don’t think
London was hard up for currency then.

very old line of Ayrshire herdsmeu. With
his brothers, William and Robert, he caine
to Australia 16 years ago, and started farm-
ing in the Kilmore district., Elected presi-
dent of the Vic. Farmers’ Union in 1922, he
entered the Reps, a year later, unseating
George Wise. He had been a starter for the
State seat of Dalhousie 12 months previ-
ously, missing by only a narrow margin. The
best-dressed man in the Hayseed party, he
occasionally emulates Bruce by wearing

From an old gallery hand:—
Thanks to the cartoonists and camera-workers,
particularly the former, Melbourne people nad no
difficulty in picking out Lang when he came south
to attend the Premiers’ conference last week. Swank
does not appear to be in his line, but it was felt
that it wouldn’t do any harm if he tried to look
and act his part a bit better. Gunn (S.A.) is a
different type—which may have been why a gallery-
man meeting him for the first time at a dinner at
Adelaide mistook him for a newspaper proprietor.
Lyons (Tas.) is almost as well known in Vic.’s metro-
polis now as Allan, its own political boss, and is
welcomed anywhere. There was hardly time to size
up Mullan, Bananaland’s Attorney-General, but gen-
erally his speech and style of address caught on better
than he did himself. A Melbourne that had accus-
tomed itself to a Ryan or a Theodore found it
difficult to take to a physique less in keeping with
the spacious northern State. On the other hand it
seemed to be a constant puzzle to the visiting
Premiers, as they studied Allan, how he got there.
Nelson Illingworth, who died suddenly last
Saturday, never reached the heights gained
by one or two Australian sculptors who both
studied and practised their difficult art
abroad, but he was a conscientious workman
and a good-hearted, genial Bohemian. His
rambling old studio at the back of a monu-
mental mason’s premises in Margaret-street
might have been the workshop of a Cellini.
Amongst its contents is a bronze bust of
Henry Lawson which should have been
acquired by one of the Australian galleries
long ago ; the Adelaide gallery was recently
considering the purchase, but Illingworth
wasn’t sanguine. Its too great fidelity to
the Lawson of the latter years w y as the
stumbling-block. After the poet’s death
Illingworth made his death-mask, and that
was to have been of assistance to him in his
work as an entrant in the. Lawson Memo-
rial competition. The sculptor, who started
life as a designer of pottery, narrowly
escaped affluence. In his youth he purchased
(on terms) a large slice of what is now
Cremorue, to oblige a friend who was selling
the land; but he found the regular payments
exacting, and let the land go for what he
had paid in. Illingworth made busts of some
of Australia’s most notable citizens. Only
63 when he died, he was so hale up to within
half an hour of the end that his death sur-
prised him as much as it did anybody.
“Seebee” : % Lowther Clarke, just dead in
England, was not the wisest archbishop
Melbourne has had. I recall a characteristic
incident. He had put his foot in it one
Sunday night at St. Paul’s (Melb.) regard-
ing the operation of Peacock’s Wages Board
system. Next day my editor sent me to ask
him to elaborate his complaint that old and
slow workers would be elbowed out. He was
very hoity-toity, and told me he stood by
what he said. I ventured to point out that
the Act provided expressly for permits being
issued to old and slow workers to enable
them to accept pay below the minimum fixed
by boards. Dr. Clarke looked uncomfottr
able, but he wouldn’t thaw. “If that’s so,’’
he remarked, “I’ve nothing more to say.”
Of course he hadn’t, but he might have
climbed down gracefully, and I might have
camouflaged his descent still more gracefully
if he had been a bit more human.
The first Salv’army meeting in Australia
took place in the Adelaide Gardens on Feb. 3,
1881, beneath a tree under which the red
guernseys still assemble on Sunday after-
noons. At this first gathering the chief
spokesman was Edward Saunders; “Adju-
tant” Gore —still living—was the seconder.
A year later “Colonel” Barker, the first
senior officer of .the Army in Australia, came
from England and planted a branch at
Collingwood (Vic.) and it took some doing.
Nicholas Cain, who heard a mill-whistle
blow for the last time the other day, made
a lot of money out of big timber. He began
life in the onee-famous Brisbane Water dis-
trict, but early cleared out for the North
Coast, where after marrying well he started
a timber mill on the Hastings. He did
his own freighting to Sydney with a small
steamer called the Trilby; then he got the
Hastings, and began a general trade, and as
he progressed secured larger steamers —Wau-
chope, Kempsey, Macquarie, Pappinbarra
and others. His head skipper throughout
was Fred Merritt, who, like his boss, began
life in Brisbane Water.
There were people who doubted wdiether
Priminister Coates of Maoriland would ever
have the heart to give up Public Works —
the job that gave him so many opportunities
of dashing up and down the country in a
spectacular manner. But with Massey’s
example before him —too many portfolios
undoubtedly hastened that stout old battler’s
end —Coates is showing discretion. The
biggest spending department goes into the
charge of Ken Williams, one of the wealthiest
sheepfarmers in the country and one of its
best-known breeders of gallopers. He owns
large chunks of the Bay of Plenty, and is so
strongly entrenched that he had a walk-
over at last general election.
Harold Hilder, now of Sydney, may have

was in Grimsby as engineer of the tug Arca-
dia when orders came for the boat to pro-
ceed to Sheerness “at the toot.” There the
men were given 22 hours’ leave, with
instructions to reassemble in the dockyard
square, where they were met by naval men
who enlisted them and a crowd of other sea-
men in the navy. Then they got back to
their vessel to find it painted a navy grey,
and fitted with a quick-firing gun. At three
o’clock in the afternoon of August 4 they
put out into the North Sea as part of the
navy, and, incidentally, had a distant view
of a German cruiser squadron. War was
declared at midnight.
When 37 years ago Duncan Livingston
decided that Queensland was the best country
for the pastoralist, he disdained using the
train to get there. With his partner, Walter
Partridge, he set
out from Mount
Gambier (S.A.) on
horseback for
Longreach, but on
the way decided to
settle at Bulwarra,
in s.-w. Queens-
land. An open-
country man, he
lived his life on
his stations; even
when he decided to
hand the manage-
ment over to his
sons, lie remained
on his Boolooroo
property at Moree
(N.S.W.), where
death found him
at 65.

Bishop Le Fapu was the star performer at
the Brisbane Anglican Synod. In wit and
wisdom he was a big show in himself. Even
dignified Arcligaiters Sharp, inspired by his
example, cracked a joke or two. Infectious
high spirits were so much in evidence that
Professor Cumbrae Stewart was moved to
solemn protest against “this sniggering and
laughter.” But the Synod found that
funny, too.
Bragg, the radium expert, for many years
Professor of Physics at Adelaide University,
has been telling some English journals just
how he got there. He was Third Wrangler
at Cambridge in 1885, put in a sporting
application for the vacant chair of mathe-
matics at Adelaide, and was at once
appointed. At that time, and for many years
after, it included physics also: —
The voyage was great fun. Of course I had to
learn some physics on the way; however much my
degree qualified me to teach mathematics, the other
was verv much air unknown world. It turned out
that there was only one elementary class, and a little
class of two who were rather more advanced; and
I managed to keep in front.
And yet, with the experience thus acquired,
he gradually dropped mathematics for phy-
sics altogether, and finally went back to
Britain as one of the world’s authorities on
radium.
Died in England, Harry (J.H.F.) Hill,
one of the most solid metallurgical chemists
the mining school of Sydney Uni. ever pro-
duced. Going to Broken Hill for his prac-
tical work after getting his degrees, he stayed
on with the Broken Hill Prop, till the war
called him away: his last job in Australia
was the recovery of by-products at the co.’s
coke works at Newcastle. He had an oner-
ous job in the munitions-making department,
and when the Armistice came the music and
art of London called, and he -settled there,
with his family, as a consulting chemist.
Just died in Wellington (M.L.) Mrs.
Fildes, one of the windy city’s pioneers,
whose mother found in Edward Gibbon
Wakefield a fairy godfather. In the ’thirties
when Wakefield’s little daughter was in Lis-
bon her bosom chum was Leocadia de Olive-
ira. On Nina Wakefield’s death, M.L.’s
coloniser adopted her little companion.
He took' the little Portuguese 'to Eng-
land and in 1839 sent her to M.L. She
married a shipmate (J. J. Taine) on arrival
in M.L. Their daughter. Mrs. Fildes, was
born in 1845, and in 1869 married a Bank
of New Zealand officer.
A. A. Davey, head of one of Brisbane’s
biggest boot factories, has been 60 years in
the trade, man and boy, and can trace a
shoemaking ancestry for 300 years. He was
a member of the abolished Leg. Council, but
his own political interest nowadays is in
pushing the tariff preference movement. At
70 he is still spry and forceful. The Govern-
ment Radio Station lately booked him for a
wireless talk on “The Story of Shoemaking.”
The ingratitude of politicians was again
exemplified in Melbourne last week by the
noor attendance at the funeral of J. A.
Finnie, librarian of Vic. Parliament. Hurt
sevei-ely in a street accident six months ago,
Finnie held on to life gamely and then had
to give up the struggle. He had been asso-
ciated with at least 150 members and ex-
members still in the flesh, yet only a poor
handful mustered around liis grave. But
for him the speeches of many of them might
have lacked whatever little sparkle they had.
He was always looking un references for
them, but the-v forgot him both in life and
death—in life because he was never
adequately paid.
W. A. N. Robertson, Chief Veterinary
Officer in the Vic. Agricultural Department,
has thrown up his job to become Director
of Veterinary Hygiene under the Common-
wealth. Robertson is something more than
a vet, and Vie. has sustained more than the
loss of a high official. He is a born organ-
iser, and get-things-done man. He stamped
out rinderpest in Westralia, and by sending
him there on loan Vie. served all Australia,
The State wanted him still, but it breaks

Adelaide has been celebrating with the
usual lunch the GOth anniversary of its
Town Ilall opening. Actually Adelaide had
the first municipality in Australia, being
properly founded in October, IS4O, with
-Hurtle Fisher as Mayor. But the corpora-
tion couldn’t pay its way, and became legally
defunct in 1843, only getting on the rails
again in 1852.

the one—Priminister Coates is magnani-
mously appointing some of the old Liberal
battlers to the Uppah Chambah. Josiah
Ilanan is the latest to be translated. Native
of Invercargill, he took to the law, gaining
fame through his defence of Minnie Dean.
He was the first Invercargill-born citizen to
become mayor of the borough. Emboldened,
he went into Parliament as a Seddonite and
represented Invercargill for a quarter of a
century. He administered Education and
Justice in the war-time, and grafted Borstal
institutions on to the Dominion’s penal sys-
tem. Though he is 58, Ilanan’s shaggy locks
show no sign of the passage of time. They
aren’t the sort of hairs that can go grey.
The election of H. I. Cohen, Iv.C., M.L.C.
and ex-Attorney-General, as chairman of
Melbourne exhibition and aquarium trustees,
recalls the jest made by the late John Gavan
Duffy, another former Law Minister, when
he was placed on the same trust. Said John:
“Nearly all my life I’ve been a man of law;
for a few years, while I was P.M.G. in Vic-
toria, I was a man of letters; now a dis-
criminating Government has made me keeper
of the great seals.”
The reappointment of Charlie Statham as
Speaker of the M.L. Parliament was gener-
ally expected. As a private member he
affected independence at a time when the
Reform Party was desperately in need of
support, and it was deemed safer to put
him up in the chair than to have him crab-
bing Massey’s pitch on the floor. Noav that
the party has an overwhelming majority his
merits as a controller of debate and master
of forms of the House have insured ’him
security of tenure. One of the handsomest
men in Parliament, in a clean-shaven austere
fashion, Statham fits into a full-bottomed
wig as if he was born in it. He has attained
EDWARD FANCOURT MITCHELL, K.G.,
of the Vic. Bar.
in his three years in the chair a combination
of nrmness, suavity and dignity that reminds
old hands of Maurice O’Rourke, the coldest
man in the chair and the most genial out
of it that ever quelled a turbulent member
or (subsequently) bought him a drink in
Bellamy’s.
IN ARUAUOY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. McGrath asked the Minister of Customs if
tiie potato-growers of Bungaree would have a chance
ol' appealing before the Tariff Board.”
1 am weary of the cities, tired of weaving dogg’rel
ditties
Or endeavoring to frame incisive prose;
Tired of packed and pulsing places with the endless
streams of faces,
Sick of billiard-rooms and races, pubs and shows.
Jerky trams I find displeasing, ferries irk me with
their wheezing;
C lose to Nature, good old Nature, I would be.
Set me—no, not east of Suez—rather, somewhere
within eoo-ees
Of the chaps who grow the spuds at Bungaree.
Granted all your haunting graces, great grey plains
and empty spaces,
I have felt your spell and listened to your call,
Hit the track through sun and shadows to putative
Eldorados
With the never lessening band of “Aren't We All?”
I have had my rush and riot, now I crave for rest
and quiet,
And there’s something speaks of Arcady to me.
Something in the very calling—and the place-name—
that’s enthralling
(Think of Rose—the Earl}’ Rose —of Bungaree!).
Oh the glories of the simple life where green-decked
ridges rimple.
Those plots, I’ll bet, of richest chocolate hue!
Oh the ecstasy alluring of the lordly bulbs maturing
For your salad or your chips or Irish stew!
Any other Inky fellow, an, he will, can have his
spell-oh
In the mountains —up the rivers—on the sea,
Take their pleasures lone or plural. Give me just
communion rural
With the chaps who coax the spuds at Bungaree.

SCIENCE HAS CONQUERED THE RABBIT PEST
with CYANOGAS (Calcium Cyanide)
Slow, costly, uncertain methods of rabbit destruction have been
superseded by fumigation with Cyanogas (Calcium Cyanide). It is
deadly to the rabbits, harmless to the operator.
Cyanogas in dust form is best applied by blowing into the burrows
with the Fumo Dust Blower. Properly used, not a rabbit can
escape,
Mr. Leslie Capel, of Spring Plain, Kelvin, Gunnedah, writes:
“I have to acknowledge receipt of your ‘Fumo’ Dust Blower (Cal-
eiurii Cyanide) purchased through your local
agents, Messrs. Nivisons, Ltd., Gunnedah.
and after a thorough and extensive trial
must express my complete satisfaction with
same. It is easy and economical to work,,
effective; and with two men operating, one
fumigating and the other filling the burrows,
a great deal of country can be got over in
one day. The results to date have far exceeded
my expectations, and I will be only too
pleased to recommend same to my friends.”

“Bunny”: I don’t agree with “The
Jumper” (B. 10/6/’26) when he says that only
through dishonest or mug receivers can faked dingo
tails be passed in. Some years ago a neighbor had
a yellow kangaroo bitch that mated with a stray
yellow half-breed cattle-dog. She gave birth to
a litter of seven pups in a hollow log some distance
from the house. One evening, two months later, she
brought the lot home at her heels. An old sundowner
killed the pups and put in their scalps and brushes
as those of dingoes. He got 10s. a head. The
man at the receiving depet was not a mug, and had
been in the habit of receiving dingo scalps for seven
or eight years. •
* * * *
“Fitz”: The black magpie is an indus-
trious tree-planter. On various parts of the Central
North Coast of N. S. Wales the white cedar grows
to perfection. In Wingham Brush it does so. There
every winter the black magpies make an appearance,
ccming in flocks. They swallow the white-cedar
berries, absorb what nourishment they can from them
and then vomit the residue. These expelled berries
can be picked up almost anywhere, and at long
distances from where the white cedar grows. Aston-
ishment is frequently expressed at finding such trees
growing in the wilds of the bush. The black
magpie is the planter. Often the trees will be
found growing near a watering-place where* the birds
go for a drink, and at the same time relieve their
craws of the berries. In due course some of them
shoot, and trees spring up. A most peculiar fact
is that while, these berries 1101301] pigs, the black
magpies thrive on them.
* * * *
“Spike”: A N. S. Wales Northern Rivers
Binglii unconsciously
confirmed my opinion
that the fire-walking
ritual practised by cer-
tain South Sea island-
ers could easily be
performed by our own
abos. without the snide
showmanship and cat-
on-hot-brick capers
which accompany the
islanders’ turn. The
other day I had taken
off the quartpot and
was getting outside a
few sandwiches when
black brother swung
along the track ac-
companied by a mangy
dog. “You gib it
work, baas?” he in-
quired, halting a yard
or two from me. To
my negative reply he
seemed downcast, but
brightened consider-
ably when I directed
him to an adjoining
station, where I as-
sured him there was
“plenty scrub-cut-
ting.” He ambled off
cheerfully, leaving me
to regard with un-
feigned amazement
the imprint of his two
naked feet in the red-
hot, smouldering ashes
of my fire. He had
stood there unmoved
for quite seven min-
utes.
“Ivriz”: The small ant-like insect with
the bite of a wasp, the speed of a cockroach and
the odor of the house bug, mentioned by “Discord”
(B. 6/5/’26), looks and smells like the Singapore
ant, very common in Broome; but w’hen he says that
“a few hours’ exposure to the strong sunlight seemed
to be fatal to the pest,” the similarity breaks off.
The strong sunlight of the nor’-west of Westralia
does not prove fatal to the Singapore curse, but
rather acts as an incubator. I have noticed that
during the sou’-east season—-April to August, which
constitutes the nor’-west “winter”—the small brown
Singapore ant is not as numerous as in other months.
These ants were first felt and smelt at Broome after
the visit of a vessel from Singapore; hence the
name.
“Broome”: A mysterious thing about Singapore
ants is that they follow carbide. I have a full
lighting plant installed, and recently they have made
a point of congregating round each burning light.
After “lights out” they apparently get in the burners,
for our abo. says: “No good that one Singapore ant;
must be every morning I eleanem lamp.”
THE QUICK THINKER.
HOUSEHOLDER: "Here, whai you doing to my fowls?”
BURGLAR: "I’m givin yer a pleasant little surprise, guv"nor: I’m trainin' ’em fer yon
fer a circus."
“Avon”: The moonshine whisky industry
flourishes in Maoriland as well as in Uncle Sam’s
domains. Down among the wilds of the Southland
back country the trade has been going on for more
than a decade. One reason is that the town of
Invercargill and some of its smaller neighbors are
dry as the result of local-option polls, though any
resident can import liquor for his own consumption.
The illegal stuff—the best of it, that is—is known
as “Hokonui” whisky—a white pot-still liquor, well
matured. It isn’t as good as the best Scotch, Irish
or rye, but is a lot cheaper. There is a local theory
that the stuff is distributed in milk-carts. But It
is procurable in Dunedin, if one knows the ropes,
and that’s beyond milk-cart radius.
* * * *
“Nick Bottom”: On the Northern Rivers
(N.S.W.) bushmen plump for the wild lime as the
best all-round timber for brush-hook, chisel, mallet
and other tool-handles, while the palm-like midginbil
is said to be the last word in maul-handles. Black
myrtle when procurable is the only whip-stick the
bulloeky will use for his ox-persuader, and when the
Kanaka was a big item in the Tweed population he
also used the flexible myrtle when making his
bows for shooting fish. On the Tweed some years
ago a one-arned bushman named Bill French made
a crust by hewing axe-handles out of river-oak and
selling them at a fair price. Despite years of abuse
one of Bill’s handles still adorns the Kelly that
provides me with morning exercise.
* * * *
“Tamornie”: Re “Borom” (B. 10/6/’26)
on the belief that a tamaranp can be responsible for
a native woman becoming a mother. I was assisting
at the taking of a census of New Ireland, in the
Bismarck Archipelago, about nine years ago, and a
woman produced two children for inspection. Inquiry
as to the whereabouts of the father brought forth the
explanation that there had been no father, but that a
tamaranp, or spirit, had waylaid her in the bush on
several occasions and the mites presented were the
result.
# * * *
“Tamornie”: “Zanthus” (B. 10/6/’26)
writes of wild raspberries in Tasmania and suggests
that they could be improved by cultivation. In
the higher ranges of New Guinea 1 have often found
vines loaded with wild raspberries. This fruit was
in every way equal to the cultivated varieties.
Strangely, the natives would not pluck the berries
and seemed to have a fear of them which they could
not, or would not, explain. In New Britain at
lower altitudes raspberries are often found, but are
not comparable to those mentioned.
* » * *
“Adelaide”: “Country Fed” (B. 3/6/26)
regards the priekly-pear as a possible menace- to
“the Victorian farmer.” Most of Vic. is further
south than Adelaide, and even as far south as Adelaide
the pear, though making a decent hedge, causes
no trouble. At suburban Stradbroke and Loekleys,
for example, hedges have flourished for half a
century without spreading out; while boxthorn and
sweetbriar, being better suited to the climate, have
infested whole paddocks. The rainfall here is, how-
ever, only 20in.; what the pear might do with twice
that amount, even in a latitude equally far south,
is another matter.
* * , * *
“A. B. See”: Can any member of the Bush
Council tell me of something that will help me to
overcome an excessive desire for smoking? In
addition to other so-called cures I have tried a gargle
of one-eighth of one per cent, solution of silver
nitrate. Though it is impossible to smoke for a
considerable time after using this, it does not lessen
the craving.
“The Itnmpus”: I can vouch that abos.
have decided views about what you might call
maternity districts. On the Ashburton River (W.A.)
a buck tool: unto himself a gin and worked for
two years at a station. One morning they appeared
before the boss with their possessions made up for
travel, and ' when he inquired the reason of their
going, he was met with the bland explanation: “.No
piccaninny come, boss.” He tried hard to change
their view of shifting on to a more fertile locality,
but failed. Ten months later a teamster brought
word from the De Grey River that the couple had
an heir to dad’s boomerang.
* * * *
“Colub” : Recent researches in the physio-
logical laboratory of the Carnegie Institute at Wash
ington (U.S.A.) have demonstrated the comparative
inefficacy of potassium permanganate as ah antidote
in snakebite cases. Pot. permang. differs from
most antidotes of the sort in being of a chemical
rather than a 1 physiological nature. Hence it must
come intimately into contact with the venom in the
blood-stream before it can convert the nuclear toxins
into harmless substances. Tlia actual process is one
of oxidation, permanganate being rich in loosely-
combined molecular oxygen, with which it easily
parts. Unfortunately for its practical value as an
antidote, it is seldom that this oxidation can be
effected. Immediately after the snake’s fangs have
injected it the poison is carried rapidly away from
the seat of the bite and soon distributed through the
whole of the circulation, or the greater part of it.
Thus by the time that the pot. permanganate is
SPEAKING OF TEMPERATURES.
DOCTOR: "Yes, sometimes it's surprising.
Non the other day I was shown a baby
who was a hundred and three.”
THE WRECK : "Wot sort uv a baby do you
call that? Why, that’s oldern I am!”
applied to the wound very little, if any, of the poison
remains there, nor is it practicable to inject into
the blood-stream sufficient of the antidote to ensure
that the whole of the poison injected is neutralised.
The best remedies for snakebite are physiological
ones, which counteract the effects of the venom
rather than the venom itself.

WHEN HADES TOOK TO TENNIS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Tennis champions, past and living, have been
invited to attend to receive the jubilee medal.”
— Cable.
The call went down to Hades
And up to Heaven’s gate;
“Ho! ye elusive ladies
And men whose skill was great,
Arise, break death's cold fetters
To take the trinket due;
And stand amid your betters,
The present matchless few.”
The sound through Heaven’s harping
Was heard upon a day
When Prester John was carping
At old St. Peter’s play.
Six champions, swiftly rising,
Laid wings and haloes by,
And with a speed surprising
Sped down the steps of sky.
But in the roaring darkness
The sound was also clear;
The devils in their starkness
Each lent a listening ear.
Four souls got off the cinders,
Their limbs still smoking brown;
They said: “If nothing hinders
We test our old renown.”.
Somewhere between Arcturus
And bright Orion’s belt.
As ancient books assure us,
There lies a shining veldt
Found by primeval Dutchmen
Who Lost their way to Hell,
And used at times by such men
As slip on asphodel.
“OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES.”
AUNTE AG. : “Well, John, and how do you like your new baby
brother?”
FOUR-YEAR-OLD JOHN : "Asleep.”
Who falls from Heaven must cross it,
That velvet stretch of plain;
Nine working angels boss it
And roll it after rain.
And there great courts are ready,
And all who will may play
Soft games serene and steady
As of an older day.
And here dark Hell’s selected
Met with the shining throng
By angel hosts protected •
With racquets tuned to song.
Forthwith, in noise like thunder,
A fiery challenge fell :
The stars stooped down in wonder,
For Heaven was playing Hell!
But Hell’s terrific service
Was past all heavenly skill—
That dodge-the-devil swerve is
A thing that counts to thrill.
Then yelled the stars in chorus—•
Triumphant seemed their tone—
“By the black night that bore us,
These Hell’s men stand alone!”
Earth heard that word come spilling
Through deeps of wireless space,
A message clear and thrilling
Whose source was bird to trace;
And one cried . “Holy poker!”
And one said “Hold me up!
These champions hold the joker
To win the Davis Cup J”
So now, the forms completed,
Luck waits to help the best;
The Heavenly host defeated,
There comes the final test.
With every tennis lover
America stands well;
The world waits to discover
If it can outplay Hell!

“Old Dan": Bees are strange creatures.
They’re sensible in some things but foolish in others.
FTinstance, look how easy it is to catcli a swarm. •
If bees were a bit shrewd they’d never be caught.
I’ve seen ’em trapped in the barmiest ways; but
Ned Holland’s, down at Horseshoe Bend, took the
biscuit. He let his ziff grow. As soon as the missus
or the nippers saw a swarm they’d give Ned the
office. He'd rush into the house, grab his accordion
nnd make for a stump in the paddock. Ferched
on this he’d play all kinds of tunes. It was the
sweet music did it. The bees’d swarm round Ned
and then calmly settle on his beard. W hen the
roll was called Ned would hit out for the house
playin’ a stirrin’ march tunc like the Marcelwave.
It was wonderful how the bees hung on ! Then Ned
would gently brush ’em off into a box before they
knew what he was doin’. He caught dozens of swarms
this way, until one day somethin’ went wrong.
THE FINER POINTS OF THE GAME.
“’Ere, wotcher mean by spittin ’ on yer 'ands Strikes
me you're a bloomin' boss’s man."
"Comrade, you misjudge me. I spits on me ’ands every
shovel full I takes—and wiv practice you can make
a spit run to harf a minute.”
They swarmed all right, but they refused to leave
their new home. Ned couldn’t make it out. He
was too wise to knock ’em about, for you’ve got
to coax bees, so he went inside to the missus tor
help. That good woman and the kids bolted for
the scrub. They liked honey, but not bees. Ned
tried to coax his cattle-dog to come nearer, fondly
hopin’ the bees would settle on him, but Blue.v
followed the family. A bloke sellin windmills
called, but one glimpse was sufficient. He left
hurriedly without an order. Ned at last had a
brain-wave. He got the scissors and carefully cut
his precious beard off. Then he made a startlin’
discovery. There was half a cake of toffee in it.
• hie of the nippers had put it there and forgot
all about it.
A NATURAL DEDUCTION.
ISAACS : “Damn the house—that’s insured! Bud my rife's inside.”
A BRAMSTEIN : “ Vot! Ain’d you got her insured ?"
“Borom”: The louse, though he is probably
responsible for trench fever, is not actually the
carrier of typhus, as stated by “K.0.H.” (B.
10/6/"26). Small as it is, the little beast possesses
a parasite of its own, a minute insect which adheres
to the lower portion of the louse’s body, and there
leads a true parasitic existence. It is this tiny
insect, discovered jointly by a Polish and an American
bacteriologist, that is responsible for typhus.
“Ouchulain” : Most of the wild pigs found
in s.-w. Queensland have sprung from tame stock,
and are quick breeders. Though there are a few-
ginger ones the majority are black, or black-and-
white spotted mongrels, with an
occasional quite dean-looking
white one. A determined effort
to get rid of them has been
going on for years, but on the
bigger runs it is a difficult prob-
lem to handle, and they are tar
from extermination. They work
great havoc with the netting
fences, but their chief offence is
the damage they do among the
-heep and the young lambs. Some
years ago their destruction was
by dogs and shooting. In 1806
3000 were killed on one station
'in this way. Snouts were col-
lected in those days, the price
ranging from 3d. to 9d. A year
after this live men had a hunt,
the game being pig-sticking. They
galloped after the pigs on horse-
back, and coming alongside stuck
the animals with shear-blades
fixed 'in stout sticks; as they
killed they rode on to the next
pig in sight. The tally for the
day’s sport touched 90, the high-
est individual count being 33.
Every winter a few “pig men”
go round, catching the porkers
with the assistance of dogs, the
latter holding the pig down by
its ears till the man runs for-
ward and ties its legs. They are
then kept in a sty till it is full,
when they are removed by dray
to a depot near the railway line,
fed up till the day the train ar-
rives, anti then shipped off to
Warwick or Toowoomba to be sold for 10s. or so a
head.
“Bill O’C.”: The discovery of foreign
bodies —chains and bullets—embedded in timber (B.
10/6/’26) reminds me of a stranger find. After
the brothers Hardsoak had drunk themselves into
bankruptcy my brother bought their northern station.
Inside the entrance gate stood an old gum-tree,
which the new owner sold to some firewood cutters.
The buyers hadn’t got any distance into the timber
before the saw began to grit and rasp ominously,
and made no headway. Examination of the “saw-
dust” showed it to be splintered glass. They tried
the other side of the tree with the same result.
Then jm old hand explained tilings. The mother
of the hard-swiping pair had insisted that they
should bring no liquor into tire house, except what
they carried inside their skins. They obeyed her to
the letter, but on their frequent return from the
local pub always took at least one bottle for the
road. They finished this off at the gate and con-
veniently got rid of the empty marine by dropping
it down a hollow spout of the old tree which pro-
jected a little about eight or nine feet up, just handy
to a man standing' in his stirrups. A few years'
steady collecting had filled the hollow from base to
plimsoll, and it was a pretty big hollow, too. The
disgusted sawyers maintained that they had bought
a blue-gum and not a bottle-tree, and that their
harvest had panned out about a ton of firewood and
five tons of broken glass; but these bush sawyers
always exaggerate.
“J.D.C.”: The Australian eagle collects a
mass of small timber when nestbuilding, and sticks
over an inch in diameter are often included in the
pile. A peculiar feature is that a stick is never
taken from the ground, but is invariably lifted from
or broken off the top of a near-by tree. Should
it slip and fall to the ground while being placed
in position, it" is allowed to remain there, and
during the first season there is nearly as much wood
under the tree as in the nest. The home may be
added to annually, but fires and decay gradually
clean up the fallen sticks, so that an old nest does
not show much “overflow.” An eagle can lift a fair-
sized lamb or rabbit with ease, but c-annot rise
straight up with his load; this seems to argue that
a stick on the ground directly beneath the nest
requires more energy to place in position than one
snapped from a treetop. I have several times
watched eagles building, and been puzzled by their
apparently foolish procedure.

ment (N.S.W.), during the first blizzard of this
winter, Jack Taylor,if

calves to a more
sheltered paddock
failed to round-up
one newly-born and
hidden frisker. Eight
bleak days later the
abandoned stray was
discovered mournfully
traversing a boundary-
fence on the wire-
netted area. The poor
little chap was piti-
ably emaciated and his
bleats were reduced to
feeble whimperings,
but he still had the
courage to struggle on,
and stood up gamely
for a long-delayed
meal when re-united
to his mother. Unpro-
tected he had with-
stood the rigors of o
highland snowstorm,
many frosty nights,
and the menace of the foxes, crows and eagles that
infest this region.
“AdeL.”: Last summer our neighbor -
hood —south of the Gulf of Carpentaria—was visited
by large flights of a masked finch flying aimlessly
through the ti-tree scrubs. They were similar in size
and appearance to P. per sonata, common about Port
Essington (N.T.), but sported an olive-green overcoat
and dusky-grey undergarment with a large black
hood over the eyes. Bushmen here call them
painted finch, but the painted finch is a different
species. Does the Council know them ? Tsvo of
the most conspicuous species of birds which annually
visit our locality are the rainbow —erroneously called
bee-eater—and the broad billed roller, better known
as dollar-bird ; both these, the most handsome repre-
sentatives of the bird world, begin to arrive late
in December and disappear early, in March. The
rollers fly from tree to ti’ee or in continuous circles,
rolling wavc-likfTall the while, flashing their glorious
dress of brown, blue and green, tirelessly working on
the destruction of the insect pests, and emitting
deep-throated shrieks as they swoop on their prey.

“Ajax”: If, as is said, smoking stunts
growth, it is remarkable that we should have such
hefty men in the country, many of whom took to
smoking almost as soon as they dropped the dummy.
1 myself smoked at 11, and now at 20 stand sft.
lHin. and tip the scales at 12st. 121 b. The first
substitute for tobacco 1 used was dry decayed wood
rolled in newspaper to make cigarettes, and my first
pipe ’was a piece of corncob gouged out to form a
bowl, fitted with a piece of passion-fruit vine as stem.
One of the best cigars I smoked in those days was
made out of the dry petals of the banana flower.

“W.J.C.” : While agreeing with “Win-
gellu” (B. 20/5/’26> that grilled brolga is excellent
and that the' stew-pot, with plenty of onions, is the
only treatment for parrot and cockatoo, I must differ
re the treatment of goanna; J prefer him (young)
toasted and served without gravy. Emu eggs may make
good custard, for there’s certainly enough body in
them; but 1 query the puddings made with peewees’
eggs. My experience is that the peewee builds its mud
nest on a thin branch at the top of ft tall tree and
its three eggs per sitting are tiny ones. But surely
the egg is too pretty and its potential bird too beauti-
ful to be sacrificed in a pudding.
* * * *
“The Rumpus.” : We were skimming nor’-
western -waters some 50 miles from Shark’s Bay
(W.A.) in search of a supposedly missing pearl lug-
ger, when Old Doggo, our black-tracker, nodded his
head towards the choppy sou’-west. “Square-fella
box bin jump about, boss,” he observed casually to
the skipper. Immediately glasses were levelled in
that direction, but not a sign or speck c-ould we pick
up. The captain gazed, too, and shook his head,
but nevertheless swung over. “Old Doggo’s eyes
are better than our glasses,” he said. The nigger
■was right. Nearly two miles on we came to
a green-painted J.D.K.Z. case, filled with straw en
velopes. Then Binghi told us a little secret. Point-
ing to -a solitary gull following eomplainingly in
our wake, he said: “That fella see box first; me
see him looking at it.”
“Delos”: It is strange that the coloring
.properties of the wild fig and black apple, which
thrive on the N.S.W. North Coast, have not been
utilised. The inedible fig is not unlike a large
black plum, whilst the black apple closely resembles
its edible namesake in shape, but is a deep purple-
black. Both fruits are full of an exceptionally good
dye. By pricking a fig with a pen a bushman wrote
all his love letters in violet ink. The same man has
now a handkerchief on which he thus wrote his
name over 25 years ago-—the lettering is still clear.
The juice from the skin of the black apple also
makes a. first-class marking ink.
ANOTHER TESTIMONIAL.
"Getting a bit thin on top, sir."
"Hooray! There 'must he something in that anti-fat remedy,
after all.”
“Up Top - ’: What is the strength of a jet
from a 2in. nozzle under 200f't. of water pressure?
At the Annan River workings (N.Q.) I saw an
embryo Hercules stand beside the nozzle, and, swing-
ing an axe with all his strength, bring it down to
cut the jet. Axe and man were hurled a distance
of 20yds. and the dangerous experiment was never
tried again.
THE LAST TEAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The teams are camping in the bend
Where soft the river sings.
They’ve reached another journey's end
And found the peace it brings.
From west of Bourke they’ve hauled the wool
Across the wide Paroo ;
Now in the dusk, all dim and cool,
They rest as teamsters do.
Sweet Night steals over everything.
The campfires larger show ;
Close in, the hobbles’ muffled ring
Is heard, as horses blow,
Rising from rolling on the grass.
Oli, starlit Darling-side,
The world is big to those who pa s
Your borders smooth and wide !
Level as ocean at their backs.
Smooth-spread before, the plains ;
The drivers on these western tracks
Live by the whip and reins.
Theirs is a world apart from curs,
Who cross old Darling’s stream.
Who would not smell the western flowers
And in the silence dream?
In with the wool and out again,
With stoves and other loads,
The hardy horses and the rnen
Die on the western roads.
Hark! in the starlight you may hear
Another team come in
With never sound of hoof or gear
Or clink of chain and pin.
The last team's camping late to-night
In the dark river flat;
Its men seek not the campfire's Tight,
To smoke and drink and chat.
The last, team hauls no earthly load,
Though it hauled wool long since.
Hark ghostly voices down the road—
“ Hey, Darkie! Come here. Prince!’’-
x.s.w.
WILL LAWSDN.

A trifle frost-bitten perhaps, but extremely
correct and decidedly stirring to even the
meek and lowly of heart, was the United
Service Ball at the Wentworth last Friday.
Why is it that crimson mess jackets always
make the Charge of the Light Brigade seem
less incredible? Is it because tlieir archi-
tecture is so amazing that in view of them
the imagination can baulk at nothing? Any-
way, there were the mess jackets, warm
under the red, white and blue illuminations:
and jostling them were the blue-aud-gold of
the Navy and the sartorial splendors of the
Flying Force —the whole served with the
sauce of decorations. Came the president of
the institution, Major-General Bruche, with
Commodore A. F. Hyde, Brig.-General Her-
ring, Colonel Cox-Taylor. Captain Robins,
and two or three hundred more tried soldiers
and sailors. Above the entrance to the ball-
room hung the white ensign, with the blue
ensign rhat once floated at the mast of
H.M.A.B. Australia—R.l.P. Under these
the G.-GT’s and the State Exes., heralded by
a fanfare of trumpets, entered; and to a
stirring roll of the drums made their way
to the dais, under the escort of the Major-
General Bruches, the Colonel Spain couple
and Australia’s new naval chief, Commodore
Hyde.
Like sands pale in the moonlight were
the silken crepe swathings of Lady
Stonehaven, and a green band and a plumey-
groen fan showed up well against the plump
upholstery of the chair she sat in. Lady de
Chair's leaf-green velvets, with their gold
oak-leaf design, have been honorably men-
tioned before. Black georgettes with exotic
silver roses enfolded Mrs. Bruche, while
Colonel Spain’s lady sought the righteous-
ness of black satin. Mrs. Robins walked
in soft sea-green splashed with a chalky foam
of beads. Wackett, of the Widgeon, brought
Mrs. Wackett. who wore velvets of many
colors weighted with Arctic fox. Sleek green
velvets clothed tall secretary Daniell’s lady.
Colonel Cox-Taylor’s- wife was softly pink
and blue. With her was Mrs. Harry Drans-
tield, in a shimmer of gold lace over leaf-
greens, in which the design of Paris was
plainly seen. Six dear little white-and-pink
debs., each like a delectable ice, bobbed their
prettiest to place and power; and among
others came Leader-of-the-Opposition Bavin
surrounded by pillars of the Constitution.
There’s nothing stand-offish in the atmo-
sphere when the Millions Club puts a Marcel
into its shingle and has a night out. Last
week the Club of 100t> yarns and so many
charmers that it has become a disturber of
the female peace, beckoned its members to
the Ambassadors. There, with the scent of
the wattle in their nostrils and the vision of
the vice-regals at their board, their smile
became as all-embracing as their creed.
Knight Albert Gould, in the absence of
Arthur Rickard, presided over the jollifica-
tion; Aubrey Ilalloran’s twinkle of wel-
come put the electrics to shame; and ship-
ping-magnate Owen Cox and Brig.-General
Herring were other notables in the fore-
front. Sir Dudley and Lady de Chair
dropped in about the, ninth hour, she in del-
phinium blue satins with a coruscating front
Panel heavily sewn with sequins. Another
frock that caused tin 1 eye to blink was worn
by Gladys Bonsor; it was the crimson-gold
of a Chinese banner and weighted by a
hem of sable.
Once a year, anyway, the learned Dr.
O Reilly has a proper setting for his hand-
some figure and impressive bearing. His
own beautiful college, St. John’s within the,
Uni., supplies the background when, on the
night of its yearly jazz and junket, Dr.
O’Reilly plays the part of the complete
host. Midway through last week the mel-
low panelling of the deep entrance hall and
stairway reflected glad lights and liigh-vol-
tagc smiles. Green and gold like a rhythm
of spring were woven into the decorations,
and the dance was even as the wedding
of the .scholarly and the beautiful. The
secretaries of this year’s flutter were J. W.
Hayes and J. Edmunds, and Father Laffau
gave willing aid in the sociabilities.
Archbishop Kelly took his ring and his
robes and his blessing out to the Palais
Royal last week, when 1500 of his flock
jazzed in the interests of Catholic chari-
ties. Fifty-three very young ladies, too,
awaited his arrival in a flutter of trepida-
tion. They wore the whitc-frockcd, tulle-
scarved debs.; and presently when his
(face hud taken his stand on the ruby carpet
the sb, each balanced by a squire, made their
way, a very demure crocodile indeed, to drop
a curtsey and kiss the episcopal ring, much
as they did on the great day of Confirmation.
Several thousand human beings and one
cat passed judgment on Percy Grainger
when he gave his first recital in the
Town Hall. The two-legged folk rhapso-
dised over everything, but the cat was more
critical. It found the Bach-Lizst fantasia
dry and walked out, vouchsafing no more
than a scornful backward glance at the virtu-
oso. But when the pianist began to play
Chopin the cat came back and attempted
to scale the platform, failing which it stole
to a point as near the Steinway as it could
get and listened entranced. And well it
might, for Grainger plays as the frail Fred-
eric might have played had he been blessed
with health and a happy heart. Grainger
bring* the great outdoors into the concert-
room, and is at his best in such music as
that of Balakireff, full of the thunder of
hoofs racing over desolate plains, or of Grieg,
who sings of the sparkle of sunlight on icy
fiords.
Backhaus, the pianist of international re-
putation, who starts at the Town Hall on
Saturday night, lias been amongst Percy
Grainger s keenest listeners during the
season. Wry unobtrusively he and Mrs.
Backhaus •■made their entry to the firs!
Grainger >;eeiial, and it was only at the end
of the I'i. rfui'inance that people round about
realised that they had been sitting almost
in the lion's jaws.
“ ‘The linehanging East’ is now about as
unchanging a,s the China Sea in a typhoon,"
says Mrs. William Macleod, just back from
a tour of Java, Japan and the port cities
of China and the Philippines. In one town
of the imperturbable Orient during their
stay all the workers in a silk-mill went out
on strike because thG management had
objected to one of the women employees
being a member of a certain political society.
The liberty of the subject couldn’t be better
defended than that in Australia ! The hotels
of Ilong Kong and Shanghai—run on a scale
of impressive grandeur—are owned by a
syndicate, of which a Castlemaine man is
managing director and the husband of an
Australian girl, handsome May Skinner
(once May McFarlano), the secretary.
Mary Laing-Meason, of Maori land, is on
the business staff of the Times, the lead-
ing paper of Shanghai; and the twin
daughters of Maud Fitz-Stubbs own a
flourishing school of dancing. The Peak,
which is to Hong Kong what Darling Point
is to Sydney, only more so, climbs up and"
up, ’ the residences grander and grander as
one ascends. Here is the mansion of Robert
110 Feng, knighted for his largesse to the
universities of "the East." Ilis wealth is
fabulous, and the sumptuousness of his
palace only a poet could set to words. Front
Kow Loon across the Bay the Peak, picked
out with silver lights against the velvet of
the night, resembles some starry field, till the
onlooker presently wonders if the cloth of
Heaven has swung low and mingled the con-
stellations with the electrics.
Now that the breakfast egg can, without
blushing, repose in the egg-cup that pro-
claims to the
world that its
contents were
laid to-day,
this is one of
the ladies to
thank. She is
Mrs. Duncan
and the secre-
tary of that
active body,
the Hous e-
wives’ Ass o-
ciation. For
the past six
months or
more she has
been sleuthing
the “new-laid”
egg to its
cold - storage
lair. It is
not, as many
seem to think,
that the
Housewives are waging war on the poultry-
farmer ; it is the much fatter middleman at
whose manipulations they have been aiming
their heaviest charges. Mrs. Duncan was
not looking at a doubtful egg when this
smiling picture was taken. She was gazing
into the camera worked by blue-eyed Judith
Fletcher.
Women writers hung up their fountain-
pens to dry the other afternoon, slipped their
cigarettes behind their ears and descended
on the Wentworth to wave the hand of
friendship at “Put” O’Connor, one of Syd-
ney’s best-known presswomen. Besides the
scribes, many of the guest’s friends in
exalted places were parked in the Palm
Court, # and after the cup had circled Mayor-
ess Cecilia Walsh and Mrs. John Barlow
wrapped a cheque in a glittersome envelope
of words and slipped £3OO into the guest’s
hand. Then Miss Marley, of the Evening
News, came on weighted down with a
luxury-exuding case of tortoise-shell crammed
with toilet accessories. This was the press-
women’s special offering, and it was accom-
panied by a bouquet of lilies-of-the-valley
specially grown for the occasion by Mrs.
Maclurcan. the high priestess of the Went-
worth. (Jeans, too. had done the handsome
thing in flowers.) “One of the nicest parties
of the week,” said everybody. And Miss
O’Connor deserved it, for she has ever been
a pillar to the beginning press-girl in the city.
Herewith Beatrice Day of the golden
laugh that helped to put “L>r. Wake’s
Patient” in a very good state of health as
far as Austra-
lian box-offices
are concerned.
Beatrice, tall,
graceful and
g r e y - clad,
talked to the
Lyceum Club
last Friday on
th e Drama,
■with which she
has been con-
nected. mostly
i n Australia,
fo r so long
that it would
hardly be
polite to rake
the memory in
search of fig-
ures. Mostly
she spoke o f
the plays of a
couple of de-
cades ago, with
their somewhat mechanically contrived situ-
ations, but stamped with the craft .of Pinero,
Henry Arthur Jones, Oscar Wilde and the
ever-young Barrie. Years they were, too.
of hard work; but surely a record was estab-
lished on a tour of South Africa, when with
her company Miss Day played 44 parts in
47 weeks. That was the period of stock
companies, when the "type” actor and act-
ress had not invaded the stage—at any rate,
not yet in numbers to be noticed.
The Yacht Club at Ivirribilli put an
extra polish on its lanthorns and crossbones
the other night in honor of visiting million-
aire mine-owner Godfrey Williams. With
his wife and daughters this American coal-
king swung across from the Surprise, his
diamond-studded, gol'd-burnished yacht in
Rose Bay, to the cheerfully modest, in com-
parison almost shabby, club. Mrs. Williams
switched on a nice design of diamond light-
ing on her black panne velvets, and wore
the yearly wage of a few hundred miners
about her throat. The daughters, too, wore
real money melted into satins and sequins
and furs without showing any fatigue in
bearing the white woman’s burden. Under a
garland of autumn leaves through which
tawny lights blinked golden eyes, Alfred
Milson cooed the word of welcome while
Don Taylor and other club celebrities smiled
their amens.
On a midwinter afternoon which laughed
gaily at the calendar and was warm as the
breath of spring, the Teachers’ College held its
fair. There was chaffering in the square,
where stalls heaped with fruit, flowers, baskets
and candied ware did a brisk trade. The State
Exes, drove out to the open-air market, which
was to profit the college building fund, and
both the Viking and his lady whispered those
words of encouragement that spur the list-
ener onward. Professor Maekie, head of
the house of learning, and Dr. Cole piloted
the vice-regals through the academic seas,
where sirens in mortar-boards lured mari-
ners with a song entitled “Mousey, Mousey!”
Alas, it had as much relation to the domestic
virtues as Circe’s invitation to Ulysses!
A cable just received tells knight Fred-
erick Waley that daughter Eileen will be
married in London on July 29. The ’groom
is her cousin, Lieutenant Ronald Herbert
Waley, who fell in love with her on first
sight when he called in at Sydney during
his world tour early in the year. The grace-
ful girl with the charming manners is marry-
ing into a regular army set. Her fatlier-iu-
law-to-be is a major in the English Army,
and her other uncle is the soldier who was
O.C. Pigeons during the Great War. His
genius in the use of the carrier-pigeon won
him both a D.S.O. and an M.C. July is
going to be Eileen’s busy month. On the
Sth she and mother and Cecile will. be
presented at Court; on the 22nd they go
to the royal garden party; on the 29th she
enters holy matrimony.
St. Mark's, at Darling Point, decked itself
in white and pink garlands for the marriage
of Bunty Senior, of Gosford, to John Tanner,
once of Bowral, now of Mosrnan. Bunty is
a pretty creature, and added still another to
the list of pleasant memories the hoary old
Marriage Market must treasure. White
chiffons and crystal were fashioned into the
bridal garment, which had a wash of chiffon
and a film of tulle veiling. Two maids in
ivory georgette blushing to rosy embroi-
defies were in attendance, and the cheerio
was at Athgrford, the Darling Point home of
old family friends, the Holroyds.
On July 14 the old boys of the King's
School will dance at the Ambassadors. Sec-
retaries J. W. Houston and R. C. Kirby warn
to ring 84824 at once, and be
not like, the unwise virgin for whom there
was left neither oil nor a bird.
D’Arcy Osborne goes by the Ulysses to
South Africa with daughter Katherine, who
on arrival will marry her young Englishman,
Aubrey (Johnny) Foa. Thereafter the two
will dwell in the lion country, several days'
journey from Jo’burg. The romance which
blossomed a year ago in London put out its
first bud long before that, at 52 Macleay-
street. With her the bride-to-be carries a
•trousseau, extensive and beautifully wrought,
almost entirely the work of her own hands.
Up near Gosford, where the earth is sweet,
there’s a group of religious women doing
the work that is surely closest to God’s own
heart —making the lives of little derelict
children happy. Here in the Kiucumber
Orphanage, in charge of the Sisters of St.
Joseph, many babies who will never know
their fathers or, worse still, their mothers
are being brought up in the health and the.
love that are the seed from which good citi-
zens spring. To carry on the work money is
needed. This year the Catholic Club is hold-
ing its annual ball at (lie Wentworth on
July 5 for the benefit of Kiucumber. Half
a guinea buys more than a ticket for the
dance ; it buys for another youngster a chance
of happiness.
It needs no sleuth to discover clues that
lead to Wales when the' bride of Arthur
Rickard, junior, signs her name. The young-
lady, christened Myfvanwy, was born Jolliffe-
Page, and she hails from Hobart. The wed-
ding took place at St. Thomas’s Church in
North Sydney, and the ’groom, who is the
eldest son of the knight, was supported by
Hamilton Merewether. The bride’s two
sisters followed her ivory moires in Huffy
tulle frocks the color of the bluebell. The
bride’s mother later did the honors at the
Hotfcl Sydney.
Miss Brisbane’s midwinter budget:—
The Repertory Society, to prove that Queensland
makes no idle boast of theatrical talent, chose
Clemenee Dane’s gloomy “Bill of* Divorcement” for
performance in the Theatre Royal. Alan Devereux,
Mary Macgregor and the Silvester maiden -were
attractive features, and George Webster (who always
looks liable to break out in a song and dance) cheered
things up as the Rev. Pumphrey. Two nights of
full-house helped this deserving association along.
Devereux, who is something of an artist as well as
actor, designed quaint programmes.
Eddie Cahill and George Brooke had the Royal for
their farewell concert on Saturday. Arrangements
for visits to lpswicli and Toowoomba fell through
owing to Cahill’s bad bout of ’flu. However he Is
now well again, as Sydney will soon see.
Mrs. Groom, mother Of the Federal Speaker, has
passed her 88th birthday. It is 09 years since she
came to the. township of bark and slab huts whiep was
then Toowoomba, and she has seen the Queen of the
Darling Downs collect 25,000 people around her.
Mrs. Groom is still very alert, mentally and
physically.
Henry Tardent celebrates his golden wedding this
week, and the home of the pair at Wynnum will
see great feasting. Tardent takes an active part
in art and literary circles in Brisbane, and has
employed a useful pen on several books and pamph-
lets, mainly on forestry.
The Women’s. Club expects Lady Stonehaven on
July 9, and is arranging a party for her; and the
wattle-trees are busy getting ready a golden show
for Wattle Day, the warm rain helping.
Toowoomba’s ball for St. Vincent’s Hospital funds
was held in the show ground’s pavilion. Palms and
evergreens lined the vestibule and tangerine streamers
■and gold-shaded lights were overhead. The ballroom
was an orange grove, and rose pink and turquoise blue
decked the supper room; early peach blossom was
a. feature* of the decorations. Mrs.. Annand, the
Mayoress, and the secretary, Miss Cronin, got
bouquets of violets lied with primrose and maitve
ribbons. Claire Ryan, in silver lace, and Moira
Donovan, in white and silver lame, were debutantes.
The Queensland Engineers Corps had their annual
dinner at the Belle Vue, with General Foott at the
head of the table, which was decorated in red and
blue, and arranged in a hollow square within which
burst a grenade of poinsettias and roses, lit up by
red and blue electric lights. Freda Bage, whose
brother was one of the Engineers killed at Gallipoli,
was a guest, and received congratulations on her
new job of delegate to the League of Nations.
The Authors and Artists’ Association disported
itself in a fancy dress dance in a setting of blue
and yellow in the Wattle Cafe; a demonstration of
the Charleston was one of the features, and a minuet,
by way of contrast.
The Rev. Flavelle-Blood tied up Marjorie Gibson,
of the Roma clan, and IV. A. Knight, of Grenfell
(N.S.W.), in All Saints’. The bride was in white
chiffon velvet; her Limerick-lace veil was lent
by Mrs. Percy Ferrier, Bellevue station (Roma).
Grizel Lockhart-Gibsou, the bride’s cousin, ’maided
in Paris-tinted lace over blue satin. The Ritz saw
the feast amidst gerberas, sweet-peas and poinsettias,
and there was a wedding-bell of white blossomry
mixed with the colors of the Royal Air Force, to
which the bridegroom belonged.

R.A.P.M. Sheets combine advantages of light construction
and rapid erection with the durability of heavy roofing.
Three protective layers on each side of the steel core make Robertson Asbestos
Protected Metal the most durable material for industrial building.
The first coat of Plastic Asphalt, then a coating of Insulating Asbetos Felt, finally
a special sealing coat —these guard the metal from the forces which so rapidly
destroy ordinary sheeting.
The Economy of R.A.P.M.
R.A.P.M. will outlast several installations of ordinary sheets without ever needing
replacement or repairs. The saving on upkeep quickly wipes off the additional
first cost. The sheets are light, strong and unbreakable—they can be erected
quickly on framework with wide purlin spacings. R.A.P.M. can be used for
replacements —the range of gauges makes it adaptable to any ordinary framework
without the use of additional purlins.

"Ph[?] Contral 1552. 1553
St Kilda pier is the gate of the city
on such occasions as that of Monday,
when the State’s new vice-regent signed on
in his new job. The skies were grey, fog
wreathed the scene, and there was a drizzle
of rain, bnt not enough to stop garlands and
flags fluttering above Young Australia, re-
presented by enormous quantities of Boy
Scouts and school-girls, who waved flags and
sang the best known of patriotic ditties. On
the ceremonial carpet Mayor Cummings gave
greeting to their Exes., and daughter Allison
passed over a boomerang and pink roses to
the lady, whose fur-collared and cuffed sap-
phire velvet coat covered a frock of fawn
and brown georgette, her felt headpiece being-
blue. The Town Clerk's wife, Mrs. Cham-
berlain, held a miniature gold cradle
containing two wee dolls. Considerable
tension w r as relieved when this became the pro-
perty of the Governor’s small daughter Eliza-
beth. His Ex., in Windsor uniform and
millinery just taken from the tissue-paper,
gave a visibly nervous reply to the address
of welcome. On the other hand, the two
aides and private-secretary Davidson made a
brave showing in scarlet coats and busbies.
But, then, they didn’t have to speak.
On the drive to Parliament House halts
were made at the Blind Institute and the
South African monument, where more child-
ren gave songful welcome, and at the Town
Hall, where an address from Mayor Brun-
ton and floral offerings from his lady were
collected.
At Parliament House, there was the usual
military pomp. Early arrivals were cheered
with the strains of a hesitation waltz by a
string orchestra. At last Deputy-Governor
Irvine vacated the vice-regal chair, Leo Cus-
sen administered the oaths, Lord Somers
kissed the Book and became a Governor.
Marshalled to the dais in the main hall the
just-auoiuted held his first reception, aided
therein by Lady Somers. There was an
accompanying tea-drinking. After looking-
in at the Malvern Town Hall later, they
were able at last to say “Home, James.”
The new Rubber Stamp is very tall, very
slim and typically English. His wife is of
the nice, fresh-looking, fair type that, seems
to be the Cold Country’s own. Noticed in
the Couucil (Chamber were the Irvine lady
and daughter Nancy, the State Premier’s
wife, Mrs. Frank Clarke in attractive bois-
de-rose covering, the Peacock dame, Arch-
gaiters Harrington Lees and Mrs. Lees, and
all the Consuls and their wives.
The committee of the Queen Victoria Hos
pital believes in making hay while the sun
shines, and there were plenty of side-lines
to the performances of Mona Mcßurney’s
opera, “The Dalmatian,” proceeds of which
went to the institution. Chicks of Mel-
bourne’s nicest peddled programmes, flowers,
chocolates and raffle tickets. The Playhouse
had as many limousines outside as if an
imported opera were being performed by
foreigners. The costuming was bright. Eliza-
beth Pinschof, as Marietta, had an old-gold
satin gown as background for an armful of
crimson roses, and later was -clad in velvet
of crimson tone prinked with gold. Black
velvet with a whisper of blue was worn by
Feme Boyle, Marietta’s nurse with ithe
charming white locks and commanding
appearance. Mrs. Alberto Zclman was re-
splendent as a Greek girl, costumed upon
harem lines. Her lover evidently made a
good thing out of the piracy business, for he
blossomed forth eventually in velvet and
satin. The chorus showed an opulent ex-
panse of cheetry-liued hose.
The Hunt Club races at Moonee Valley
did a lot to console the bookies for parting
with their just-paid license fees. Had the
average punter been superstitious enough,
or loyal enough to remember that it was
young Edward Windsor’s birthday (and he is
fond of horses too, though it s an unrecipro-
cated affection), Hector Mclsaacs might
have resolved to lead a better life: the win-
ners were Nobility, King’s Consort and The
Flag, and even Sugar King caught the
judge’s eye and was only relegated to second
place after the stewards had weighed a
protest. To keep the affair in touch with
its name, there were a couple of races for
Hunt Club members —one over the sticks —
and the followers of the hounds rolled up
en masse, bringing their sisters and their
cousins and their aunts. The weather
prophets promised nothing, so coats and
skirts, wraps and furs, with gay felt hats,
were feminine wear. Priminister Bruce’s
lady sported a grey tailor-made and a grey
hat enlivened with a dash of Wedgwood blue.
The Gordon Lyon couple, with daughter
Fail-lie, Barbara and Allison Madden, Gwen
Johnson, the Taylors of Overnewton and
Lorna Embling were in the crowd.
Garlands of pink rose's decorated St. ivilda
Town Hall when Gcnazzano’s ex-students
held their yearly re-union. The hall was
fresh from the whitewash brush, and the
walls, pure as a soul new shriven, made an
effective foil for gay frocking. Fifty-two
hostesses, carrying posies, were led by Presi-
dent Mrs. John Morgan, wearing Wedgwood
blue. Mrs. Gordon Renniek, whose lace
gown was of cosmos pink, and Rose Billion,
with silver and petunia embroidery upon
mauve georgette, wrestled with secretarial
duties successfully. Pretty Claire Lehane,
who became Mrs Gordon Forbes Maclean
the other day, had a glimmering of pink
beneath silver lace. She and her husband
bade many farewells before setting off for
Stirling, where his regiment is stationed.
The overwhelming prevalence of the shingle
caused the eye to winnow out the unshorn.
Past students of the National Gallery held
their annual frivol at St. Kilda Town Hall
last week. The setting was supposed to sug-
gest the Arabian Nights and the seductive
flavor of the Orient, but the decorations were
rather disappointing. A trio of life-sized
elephants, a few big lanterns, and a dado
round the gallery depicting domes and mina-
rets completed the scheme, with a. Cairo
street-scene on the stage. To fit the scenery
many of the dancers were attired as sheiks,
harem ladies and camel-drivers. There were
also pierrots and pierrettes, toreadors and
characters “not otherwise enumerated” as
they say in the Customs Tariff. The Charles-
ton was danced en caterpillar, and a general
air of great hilarity reigned. The Jimmy
Dyer couple, who brought along a party that
had evidently .just stepped out of the pages of
“Omar,” carried off the honors of the even-
ing. The head of the clan laid aside his
kilt to don the golden robes and turban of
the teutmaker, and the chatelaine of Kinnoul'l
was Thou in green and purple.
The Bridge Club made jazz trumps for its
first annual shivoo. The membership is now
about 250. Maud Gregory, who wore black
chenille-embossed georgette to the party, is
the strong right hand of the club, for she
initiates the novices into the mysteries.
But on the night of the dance never a pack
of cards was to be seen. After the theatre
some of “The Best People” company and a
detachment of the Barrie players joined the
frolic. Mary Hinton Pitt Rivers sported
a green tulle scarf over a lace gown
sparkling as a tropic night; Joan Rad-
ford was a sunset effect in flame
tones; and Betty Schuster had a dado of
shaded purple blossoms below the waist-
line of a pale lilac frock. Mrs. Newhouse,
wife of the club secretary, was a dainty
figure in black gleaming with silver, and
Mrs. Richard Fitcher had squirrel fur bor-
dering a flared gown of hyacinth mauve.
The lady with the friendly smile is the
wife of Richard Fitcher, whose hobby is help-
ing charity en-
tertainments—
she specialises
in sweet stalls
and in devis-
ing and con-
structing
dainty wallets
for carrying
the chocs.
This last is a
little go Id-
mine which
she pioneered;
it ensures the
ready sale of
all the sweet-
ties she cares
to offer. Just
lately a new
use for the will-
ing worker’s
artistic talents
has presented
itself, and she
is evolving a scheme of decoration for the
ball in aid of the Civil Ambulance Service.
Incidentally, she is a good patron of Aus-
tralian art, and three sons at college see
to it that mother also takes a lively interest
in who’s going to win the boat-race and such-
like momentous questions. The picture cam* 1
out of a Lafayette camera.
The Leslie Stuarts’ home at South Yarra
was the scene of a determined effort to put
something into, the coffers of the Melbourne
Hospital Auxiliary. Mrs J. Beaclmm
Kiddle seeretaried the card-playing in the
afternoon ; and Nanette Stuart, in lilac-shot
taffeta, with Joan Newbigin. a charming
contrast in soft green and silver, watched
over the dancing in the evening. The chate-
laine of Logan House, a symphony in jade;
was on hand to give first aid to the young-
hostesses, and found a harmonious back-
ground in a ballroom decorated with the
hues and blooms of marigolds and Iceland
poppies. Many unattached maidens found
partners at a premium and took refuge iu
the dressing-room. The wise virgin of these
days makes sure of not being a wallflower
by bringing a squire, even if she has to pay
for his ticket. There are any number of nice
young things in trousers who won’t give
their services otherwise.
The peep of the eultry West African coast
permitted the first-night audience at the
King’s when “White Cargo” was unloaded
caused a moment’s forgetfulness of the atmo-
sphere without. Helen Stransky, the half-
caste Tondeleyo, is a shapely damsel whose
apparel consists of a short length of gaily
stencilled cloth, with bangles and necklaces.
The garments worn by the male dwellers of
the Coast wouldn’t find sale at an Oppor-
tunity shop. There was a nice array of posies
for Miss Stransky at the curtain fall, when
Leon Gordon confessed to unnecessary
anxiety regarding the reception of the piece.
Evidently spmebody had been telling him
things about Melbourne’s Sabbath.
This thoughtfully alive headpiece belongs
to Ruth Conabere, one of Beresford Fowler s
out s tanding
mummers. She
has played
only three
parts on the
amateur
boards, but
each time as a
star —a pupil
of Duleio
Bland, she had
previously won
lots of compe-
tition laurels.
Her first
chance came
with ‘■Ruther-
ford and Son,”
put on by the
Little Art Co.
recently. A
s y m p athetic
voice, a natu-
ral manner
and great in-
tensity of feeling helped her to make the
Janet of that somewhat lugubrious drama an
extremely interesting young person. Broo-
thorn made our picture.
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer got in an early wel-
come to the Kendall string quartette. The
cars of the invited splashed up the well-kept
drive of Kinnoull in pouring rain, but within
all was warm and snug. The hostess, in
sapphire blue, enriched with gold thread
embroidery, received her guests in the dining-
room, where high tea was toward, served
amid a forest of Iceland poppies. After-
wards the four talented ladies from overseas
were handed posies from which dangled
sprigs of early wattle, and each was given
a book of Shaw Neilsou’s poems. The host-
ess gave the music-makers the greetings of
the Music Society, and first-violin
Katherine Kendall said their thanks in dulcet
tones. Australia’s composers were then
given an innings, songs by Arthur Benjamin
and Mona Mcßurney being offered by Viola
Morris, after which Claude Hall spake verses
by Will Ogilvie and Shaw Neilson.
Tlie Kirkby-Kiddle wedding was a spec-
tacular success. Christ Church, South Yarra,
was converted into a garden of nodding white
chrysanthemums. The bride was Ed 114, off-
spring of the East St. Ivilda Ivirkbys. Tall
and slim, she twinkled like an ice maiden on
a frosted Christmas card in her gown of
oyster-white satin and silver lame showered
with brilliants. The court train was of
silver brocade edged with orange blossoms.
A Russian coronet of pearls with eardrops
of blossom confined the flowing veil of tulle,
powdered with pearls and sparkling diamente,
and a shower bouquet of orchids, azaleas and
cactus-dahlias was carried. The attending
maids, Fairlie Kelly and Betty Vickery (Syd-
ney), were prettily frocked in almond-green
chiffon taffetas, made with full skirts and
pointed bodices. Bands of silver were worn
on the hair, finished with rose sprays which
matched their posies. The bridegroom was
John Lindsay Kiddle, of Malvern. After the
ceremony Mr. and Mrs. Harry Kirkby held
a reception at Chastleton, Toorak.
Lieut.-Col. Davidson, private sec. to Baron
Somers, has already got in touch with some
of his ain folk from north 0’ Tweed. The
Royal Caledonian Society had him for a
night out last week, and the gold loving-cup
presented by Lord Rosebery was passed
around without anybody coveting it too
greatly.
Last American mail brought news that
Cath, youngest sister of Enid Bennett, has
just had a part in a Norma Talmadge movie.
Marjorie, who came this way with Joseph
Coyne, still sticks to the regular stage, and at
present is in Omaha, Neb., with a company
that includes Boyd Irwin and his wife.
After their holiday tour of the Holy Land,
Enid Bennett and husband Fred Niblo are
devoting themselves to making a home at
Beverley Hills, Los Angeles.
The Rupert Kers, whose station is near
Richmond (Q.), are rejoicing in the visit of
the Stork with a daughter. The infant’s
mother is known here by her gramophone
records, for she is Phyllis Lett, one of Eng-
land’s finest contraltos. Many Diggers heard
the famous voice at first ear, as it were,
when in Blighty during the Big Upheaval.
Mrs. Ker has been in Australia about two
years, and for the past few months has been
residing at Brighton. *
Rabindranath Tagore’s poem “Chitra”
was presented to an audience at the Albert-
street Con. by four clever girls turbaned and
robed in Indian fashion. Beatrice Touzeau,
who took the name-role, included in her
apparel a garment of Parma violet satin
with a veil of dull gold fabric. Mercy Smith
was the brave Arjuna, whose vow of celibacy-
tottered when the beauteous Chitra came on
his horizon and proceeded to use her powers
of fascination. The part of Madana fell to
Florence Stack, and Rita Callow was the
affiliated deity Vasenta. Howard Edie, who
was responsible for the production, had a
few words to say upon the re-birth of India,
and Ida Walker gave souk- of Tagore’s
verses by way of prologue.
Nice big squares of cardboard decorated
with imposing-looking armorial devices are
being scattered by suburban mayors. St.
Kilda, Essendon and Coburg are going to
hold their respective annual hops next
month. Mayor and Mayoress Robinson of
Coburg, whose show is on duly 27, invite
maidens who mean to make their plunge
into society on this occasion to inform the,
town clerk; a special basketing of buds is
being arranged.
Isabel Hodgson, who gleaned first-class
honors in English when she graduated at
the ’Varsity last year, is the first to benefit
by the Imperial League’s fund for the edu-
cation of war orphans. Last week she set
out to enjoy a scholarship which will give her
two years at Oxford and on the Continent.
The talented lass, who is a daughter of Cap-
tain Hodgson, a victim of Gallipoli, was fare-
welled at Anzac House by the trustees of the
fund, who provided tea and cakes and a
light sprinkling of speeches.
The Speck lets itself go:—
Fully 3000 souls wedged themselves into the gaily
decorated Hobart City Hall for the long-talked-of
Bohemian Artists' Ball, the first of its kind ever
held in this village, and as gay as youth should be.
Costumes ranged from the-beautiful to the weird, and
from 6000 8.0. to the present day. The Salter sisters
and Trixie Mecch danced amid tumultuous applause. The
judges found the job of judging the costumes more
difficult than 'they bargained for.
R. M. Clark, of the Marcus, Clark firm, has lent
his collection of 260 oils and water-colors for exhibi-
tion here, and the oils are making a brave show
at the Art Gallery just now. Lambert, Rupert
Bunny, Tom Roberts, Lister Lister, Arthur Streeton,
Septimus Power, our old frieffd Piguenit, Maclnnes
and Penleigh Boyd are amongst the Australian artists
represented. Water-colors and pastels will be shown
later and then the show will be taken to Launceston
and perhaps even to some of the smaller towns.
The clever little wife of the Speck’s Premier had
greatness thrust upon her at the meeting of the
Federal Executive of the A.L.P. in Melbourne.
Hubby was to have helped discuss the referenda issue
but couldn’t leave the Premiers’ Conference, so his
lady spoke for him—the first time a woman has beer
given a voice in such deliberations.
Sister Adelaide’s gleanings:—
Scotch, youngest of the colleges here, staged its
third annual dance in the ballroom that saw main
such festivities in the spacious days when the Barr
Smiths owned Torrens Park and private entertaining
was still a practised art. The school colors of blue
and gold fluttered from walls and ceiling in streamers
and balloons, and scarlet poppies glowed from sober-
hued gum leaves ; supper was in the dining-room,
where there was the blue of irises and the gold ol
Iceland poppies.
Invitations were out, too, for the Girton House
Old Scholars' dance, but the death of the school'-
founder, Mrs. J. A. Smith, postponed it indefinitely.
Few women will be more missed than she.' In the
dim past a small private class in North Adelaide
expanded rapidly into a successful school that was
given up on her marriage. Then, after 17 years’
respite from teaching, she decided to begin again.
Girton House came into being and rapidly developed
into one of the best known and most popular girls
schools in the State. Illness compelled its founder’s
resignation about a year ago, but the school goes
on and the mark her personality left upon it will
endure for years. Her husband and two sons survive
her.
The latest entertainment for members of the Alli-
ance Franchise ■ was an original comedy by Hope
Crampton based on an incident in the Alliance’s
own affairs, which made it, particularly amusing to
members. The authoress played the lead, with hall
a dozen of her fellow Alliancers to help her.
The Conservatorium String Quartette, after a rocky
financial passage last year, is combining business
with art for this season and gave its first concert
with the comfortable knowledge that its list of
season-ticket holders was long enough 1o guarantee
it against loss. The Public Library Lecture Room
was packed and the quartette—Charles Sehlisky, Kath-
leen Meegan, Sylvia Whitingtou and Harold Parsons,
with Maude -Puddy at the piano—-used Mozart,
Debussy and Cesar Franck to prove itself to oc at
the top of its form.

The General Objects of the Company are, inter alia:
To acquire from Mr. A. 11. Clirystal his right, title and interest under an agreement
for tlie purchase of one or more “Baker Perkins complete automatic bread-baking; au<
wrapping plants. Tlie agreement comprises a purchasing right of further plants tor tie
State of New South Wales and the Federal Territory, subject to certain conditions set
out in the said agreement for purchase, dated Ist May. 1926.
To purchase land and premises for the purpose of installing the plant and trading
as'bakers to tlie full extent and capacity of the plant to be purchased, and also, it
thought lit, to acquire by purchase or otherwise, the business and goodwill ot one or
m ° le The k purchase price of the complete automatic plant (excluding foundations) erected
and in working order is £31.070. , . .
The Plant referred to in this Prospectus ns an Automatic Tin Bread l lant, simi-
lar to the plant installed at the Wembley Exhibition in England. .
Wrapped bread of the highest quality should be produced by this plant foi less
than it costs to manufacture unwrapped bread under the present system.
Wrapped bread hermetically sealed will be preferred by the public. It can be con-
fidently claimed that every member of the community will welcome a change which will
enable them to have bread on their table which lias practically not been previously
touched by the human hand. , , .. ~ ~
The fact of working on a scientific and regular basis would greatly facilitate manu-
facture, and save the bakers a good deal of the worry and anxiety caused through the.
actions of inefficient and careless tradesmen.
Baker Perkins Proprietary, Limited, state that a large number ot these plants have
been and are being successfully operated in England and America. A list showing tlie
names of some of these companies, and full particulars of the Plant, may be inspected at
the office of the Secretaries.
SUGGESTED POLICY.
It is proposed to purchase a well-established bakery business, and also to purchase
property suitable for the immediate installation of the plant upon arrival
Having successfully established the business with an output equal to the capacity ot
one automatic plant, the Company’s operations could be profitably expanded by the
purchase of additional plants. In this way the Company s right to purchase further
“Baker Perkins” Automatic Plants in N. S. Wales and the Federal Territory may, if
so desired, be preserved for many years.
It is confidently expected that the annual net profits on the above mentioned turn-
over should be £12,000, which represents 15 per cent, of a paid-up capital of £BO,OOO.
As additional plants are established and the Company developed on the lines ot
solely manufacturing the return on capital should he even greater.
The Directors will proceed to allotment when 30,000 Contributing Shares have
been applied for. This amount will enable the Company to pay the preliminary de-
posits on the purchase of the first unit, and also pay for some well-established business.
Those to whom the first issue of 70,000 contributing shares are allotted will receive
option certificates giving them the right for five years from the registration of the
Company to apply for and pay for in cash an equal number of shares at par in any issue
of shares made from the present unissued capital of the Company, comprising 371,500
shares. The Vendor and his nominees will receive similar option certificates giving the
Vendor and his nominees the right for the like period to apply for and pay for in cash
50,000 shares at par in any such issue of shares. In the event of such applications
exceeding the number of shares offered in any such further issue the allotment to be
made to the holders of option certificates in respect of the said 70,000 contributing shares
and the Vendor and his nominees in the proportion of 7 to 5.
BROKERAGE.
The usual brokerage will be paid on, the disposition of shares to Brokers for all
applications lodged by them. Applications may be made through any member of the
Stock Exchange.
PRELIMINARY EXPENSES.
All preliminary and flotation expenses, including Stamp Duty, Legal Costs, etc.,
will be borne by the Company when floated.
CONTRACTS.
The following are believed to be the only material Contracts:—
Agreement dated Ist May, 1926, made between Baker Perkins Proprietary, Limited,
of the one part and' Alexander Raymond Chrystal of the other part for the sale
of one Automatic Tin Bread Plant on terms and conditions contained therein.
Agreement dated Bth June, 1926, made between Alexander Raymond Chrystal of the
one part and Thomas Alan Billerwell as Trustee for and on behalf of the Company
of the other part. , .
Agreement dated Bth June, 1926, made between Alexander Raymond Chrystal of the
one part and James Frederick Elliott, Francis Egerton Bryant, Harold Thomas
Morgan, Henry Ricketson Burton; Arthur Leamington Green, Peter Louis do

NOTIONS
J'he Governor, despite his Sydney failure,
was a 3-to-l favorite for the Post Phillip Hurdle,
two miles, at Williainstowu (Vie.) on Saturday. As
iu Sydney, he toppled over, and Palbi’s brother,
Joulni (10 to l), who had alwavs been prominent,
won comfortably by 21 lengths from Jleke (7 to 2),
with Sconrie (10 to 1) a length away. Little Mer-
vie, a well-backed S. Aus. candidate, fell and was
killed. Joulni, who is trained by Ron. Cameron ior
A. Crozier, carried 9st. 91b. (he has 4lb. less in the
National), and ran the distance in 3min. 46jsoc.
Deai on (4 to 1), who had run third in the Toolam-
bool Hurdle at Caulfield the previous Saturday, made
the opposition look cheap in the Maiden Hurdle,
winning by three lengths from Bridgehead (14 lo 1)
and the favorite, Royal Buzz. With 9st. 4lb. in the
National—lolb. less than on Saturday—he must have
a chance, as he obviously stays well. Only four of
the eight starters in the Williainstowu Steeple
stood up. One of them was Reparation (3 to 1), who
cut down the leader, Strath Bligli ((> to 1), in the
straight and beat him home by a length or so,
with King Higli (4 to 1) two lengths away third.
Reparation (Charlemagne II —Grafton Lassie) is
trained by F. Robinson for B. Poulsoh. He is in
the Steeple at Flcmuigton with 9st. 81b., 61b. less
than on Saturday, and is sure to have a fair
following. E.- H. Clyde landed a double with the two-
year-old Lanson (5 to 1) and the Sir Dighto.n mare
Elluline (5 to 1), who just beat Cecil Godby’s
importation, New Hope (7 to 2), in the Point Cook
. Handicap, 10 furlongs. So far Godby has found
New Hope an unlucky speculation, though -he did
down a poor field at Rosehill.
If the going is as heavy at Flemington next Satur-
day as it was at Williamstown, Pildin (list. 71b.)
and Piratic (list. 41b.) will be greatly disadvantaged.
Still, both are exceptionally good hurdlers, and Pildin
has done a great preparation, while Piratic has
evidently retained the condition lie showed at Rand-
wick. Among the lightweights, Olbrook, Gunnedah
(both 9st. 41b.) and Deacon read well. This page
selects Pildin to win his second G‘. N. Hurdle, with
Piratic and Olbrook in the picture,
* * a x-
Beauliaiiia, a smart three-year-old gelding
by- Featherstitch—Josephine, was the most conspicu-
ous performer at Canterbury Park (N.S.W.) on
Saturday. Backed down to 9 to 2 for the Flying
Handicap, lie beat a fair held of sprinters decisively;
Rostrum’s half-sister Tullulah and the Metropolitan
winner Polycletan were among the unplaced division,
the mare being favorite. Lady Lizzie (6 to 1), who
had run badly at Randwick and Rosehill, showed
very different form in the Canterbury Handicap, 11
furlongs, having the race at her mercy a long, way
from home. Ayrwynne (St. Alwyne—Ayrshire Maid)
and the unlucky Luddenliam dead-heated for second
place; the latter was badly served at the start.
Though only tw o absolute favorites got home (there
were 10 races), most of the winners were well
supported, so the bag didn’t bulge as much as
usual when MeShortodds hoarded his car. Still, the
gentleman bets so carefully at these suburban meet-
ings that he never loses much, if at all.
* * * #
The V.A.T.C. and VMM.', handicappers-
have not crushed the topweights out of the two
Cups. Heroic, who was a close fourth in the Sydney
Cup with 9st. 71b., and who beat Windbag at w.f.a.
two days later, lias 9st. 111 b. in the Caulfield Cup.
Windbag, who wasn’t among the Caulfield nomina-
tions, has lOst. in the two-miler—the burden with
which Poitrel won in 1920 and Eurythmic looked like
winning in 1921 till another horse got in the way
of the Westralian chestnut’s swinging leg. Heroic
gets 41b. from Windbag, Manfred 91b., Spearfelt,
Pantheon and the Maorilander, Count Cavour 111 b.
Heroic and Windbag is already a popular double;
indeed, all going well with Heroic, he is pretty
sure to start favorite for the first leg, although Mau-
fred (9st. 61b.), Tookarby (Bst. 121 b.), Spearer (Bst.
71b.), Valamita (Bst. Clb.) and Naos (7st.) will
not lack support. The last-named is in the Mel-
bourne Cup with the same weight. He showed good
staying power in the Sydney Cup, and is likely to
improve, so the bookmakers will keep him on the
safe side. Other attractive candidates for the
Melbourne Cup are Belgamba (Bst. 91b.), Spearer
(Bst. Clb.), Piastoon (Bst. 41b.), Night Heron (7st.
91b.) and the Derby colt, Rampion (7st. 9lb.) —
he has lib. more in the Caulfield Cup, but, in view
of his Sydney engagements, is an unlikely starter.
Fujisan heads the Epsom Handicap list with 9st.
91b.—by no means a prohibitive weight if the big
Valais horse can reproduce his recent Queensland
form. Boaster (Bst. 131 b.) and Amounis (Bst.
111 b.) are an attractive pair, nor does Valiant read
badly with Bst. 91b. Hemisphere (Bst. 31b.),
Wedding Eve (Bst.), Sir Alick (Bst.), Aorangi (7st.
121 b.), Quan Tart (7st. 101 b.) and Bunting Wallace
(7st. 91b.) are other good horses with nice weights.
Windbag and Heroic are bracketed with 9st. 131 b.
for the Metropolitan, but neither may start. Pan-
theon, a good weight-carrier, gets 9st. Clb., and
Polycletan, who won in 1924, has the 9st. with
which lie ran third last year —he is certainly to
lie labelled dangerous. Dainty Davie, Resource and
Johnnie Jones, a very warm trio, have Bst. 31b., and
the handicapper has not been hard on either Night
Heron (7st. 101 b.) or Donald (7st. 71b.), of New-
castle Cup celebrity'. If this page went in for'
backing doubles it would take Heroic and Naos for
the two Cups, and Boaster and Night Heron for
the Epsom and Metrop., in preference to any other
combination. But backing doubles is a fool’s game
except, perhaps, on the tote, and Australia hasn’t
got a double-event tote.

“S.G.” : -V horse called Kedgeree, who had
shown uncommonly good form at suburban meetings,
was impounded by the A.J.O. stipendiary stewards
at the beginning of May on suspicion of being a
“ringtail.” While the case was being considered by
the A.J.C. committee, a report spread that the
animal was none other than Purser, the too-famous
Caulfield Cup winner, which, of course, is absurd—
as absurd as the old story that Parthenopaeus, who
RE-UNITED.
RINOSIUER ( bitterhy) : "Blime if they ain’t the long-lorst brothers!”
was wiped out for life in 1897 together -with certain
turf celebrities of the day, was rung in as a Caulfield
Cup favorite the following year. However, the
committee is not satisfied that Kedgeree is by Rice,
sire of hurdlers, out of Fancy Vest, as described in
the nomination papers, so it has disqualified the
’orse, though not the owner, who is also the trainer.
Before it arrived at this decision, it waded through
masses of evidence as to Kedgeree’s marks, “brands
or lack thereof” (the horse is unbranded, the com-
mittee says; although a brand was mentioned in the
receipt given by the breeder to the owner) and age;
on the latter very important point representative vets,
disagreed. It is doubtful whether the disqualification
of the horse, without that of the man, would be sus-
tained if it were legally tested, but the owner dis-
gustedly says lie is not going to test it —he will quit
the game instead.
* * * *
“Hasen”: The punter has been rated by
a Victorian Judge for his ignorance, in that most
of him, his Honor says, cannot even pronounce the
names of the prads he backs. It’s a true bill as
regards Lycurgides, who has been running promi-
nently in Melbourne with frightful consequences to
sticklers for orthoepy—“Lickerjides” and “Likea-
geegees” are two of the tongue-twistings I have
heard. But the brightest example of recent date
I struck at Epsom; the horse was the Western
District hurdler, Sparkling Mozelle, who was well
backed in the Brush Steeple. On the first wave
of the first rush for it one hard-bitten sport paused
long enough to confide to a friend, “They sav it’s
a cert. Yes, Number 2 —Sparkling Molasses!’’ The
books had no trouble with this name —naturally
enough !
“Ascot" : Two Tatt.’s sweeps on the Rock-
hampton (Q.) Cup caused a record field of 20 to
turn out, and Gheveley, the English polo pony who
recently won the Toowoomba Cup, added another
bauble to his owner’s sideboard. The stake- was
worth £7OO besides the “considerations.” Cheveley
started favorite at 4 to 1, and McShortodds howled
when his number went up. The tote laid 4.3 to 1
( £2 13s. for 10s.), threw in two other dividends
for good measure, and made no complaints.
vfc #
“Bris.”: That lessee-rider of a Brisbane
trotter who was warned off unregistered courses
for 12 mouths for giving his mare to a bookmaker
to “go on with” (B. 24/6/’26) will not have to
serve his sentence. The appeal board promptly com-
muted it to a fine of £25, which, like the £lO
penalty imposed on the bookie, went to charity.
Honor is now satisfied, and the Red Hots go on as
before.
*
“The. Deacon” : Mention of Rangi Thomp-
son, the Maori jockey (B. 17/6/’26), reminds me
of what wonderful riders some of the native young-
sters I have seen in the North Island are. Maori
horses are only weeds, but to see those bare heels
and brown hands lifting them along in a finish would
be an education to some of the languorous saddle
sitters who inflict themselves on racing stables in
Australian capitals. However, the Maori grows out
of a jockey’s weight at an early age, and is apt to
be infernally indolent. That is why there are so few
Rangi Thompsons.
* * * *
“J.C.A.”: When I was in India, Calcutta
Sweep tickets on the Epsom Derby (B. IQ/6/’26)
were procurable only through members of the Bengal
Club, a select domicile of ancient civil army
officers, medicoes and merchants. About 1890, some
of these old fogies objected to tickets being sold to
all and sundry. Thereupon, John Apcar, the Armenian
merchant prince and purchaser of Melbourne Cup
horses to win the Viceroy’s Cup, said: “If that is'
the only objection, I’ll take all the tickets and issue
them in my own name.” This he did; he bought up
the lot, and got one of his office babus to rubber-
' stamp them “John Apcar,” the names of the final
purchasers being entered on the butts, which were kept
in Apcar’s office. The Calcutta Turf Club, like the
A.J.C. and V.R.C., is not a social club. Its members
are scattered all over India, and meet only at Christ-
mas time for the annual races.
For the past two years coursing has been
a profitable business for the Carter brothers. Last
season their dog Terminus carried everything before
him at Rooty Hill (N.S.W.), while liis little sister
Ezic attended to the rich Vic. Waterloo, landing a
stake of ,£lOOO and a parcel of bets which dwarfed
even that prize-money. In the puppy stake at
Liverpool last week, the Carters had Miss Terminus
in, and about her chance took £l5O to £l5, £l5O
to £3O, £BO to £2O, £l5 to £5 and £2OO to
£lOO. The lady did the right thing, though the
final was hotly contested; it was not till the indus-
trious hare had nearly been reached that Miss Ter-
minus snatched the lead from Robin Hood, and the
stake. Owing to scarcity of hares, clubs take special
pains training them —all but one out of 62 coursed
struggled into port.
“A.J.S.” : Re the late Frank Hewitt’s 100-
vards “record’’ (B.
17/'6/’26). Hewitt,
Bird and Topley, the
walker, with Sedger,
their trainer, arrived in
Melbourne on December
17, 1869, Hewitt and
John Gregory Harris,
the Australian cham-
pion of the period, were
matched over 100, 150,
300, 300 and 440 yards,
and the 150, 200 and
300 were run off on the
Melbourne Cricket
Ground on Saturday,
March 5, 1870. Harris
won the first two
events, and broke even
with Hewitt in the 300.
On the Monday, Hewitt
won the 100yds., the
440 (in 514 sec.), the
SCO run-off and the
match. The official
timekeeper certified
that the hundred had
been done in 9:; see.
But another watch-
holder made it lOsec.
dead and a third
10Jsec. So there was
always grave doubt
about that “record.”
Though Harry Collins is still a youngster
1)2 shaped like a back-number against “Sunny” Jim
Williams, colored American second-rater, at the
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night. To get the
match, “Sunny” had to bind himself Jiot to exceed
list. 21b., which, seeing that they are both middle-
weights and that list. Clb. is the limit, was as absurd
as it was arbitrary. As it turned out, both made
lOst. 13Jlb. Collins is a bad beginner, and when
“Sunny” started stormily, the Australian was like
a man caught out in a downpour without his umbrella.
He bad nowhere to look for shelter from a hail of
swings, drives, jabs and crosses. He weathered the
first two rounds somehow, and from the third onward
fought hard, but never hopefully, his heaviest hook
and uppercut merely checking the coon’s attack. In
the eighth round Harry was battered to the canvas
bv a hurricane of heavy blows, the shift-and-swing
being conspicuous. He was up when the count
reached three, but Williams rushed him to the ropes,
and there the paleface was so obviously done that
Wallis stopped it. Exit Collins !
* * *
Mike Yokel (12st. 121 b.) and Martin
Ludec-ke (I2st. 91b.) can both wrestle and act, and
they put on a pretty show at Melbourne Stadium.
1’ oxy Mike had apparently kept much up his sleeve
in his previous matches, but he opened his whole
box of tricks for Ludeckc's benefit. At times, rules
as well as limbs were stretched, but the referee
never had cause for stopping the excellent display.
The best hold of the night was a perfect short-arm
scissors in which Yokel found himself in round 6 ; the
V. ank, however, is a stoic under punishment, real
or apparent, and stuck it until the bell. The decision
-—a draw—was popular.
* * * *
After beating Lancashire by an innings
and 77 runs, the Australians obtained some batting
practice for the second Test in a two-days’ fixture
with Derbyshire. Judged by - subsequent events, it
benefited Bardsley (127) more than anyone else;
Collins got 93, Richardson 58 and Woodfull 53 n.o.
With 5 wickets down for 373, Collins declared, and
the county was rattled out for 146, mostly by
Grimmett and Mailey. In its second innings Derby-
shire had lost 2 wickets for 55 at the call of time.
There was no small advantage in winning the toss
with the Lords wicket in perfect condition—Tate
said it was the best he had seen since lie bowled at
Sydney—and every prospect of three fine days for
the big game. Nevertheless, our men failed tc
make the fullest use of their luck, and but for
Bardsley, who justified the selectors, after his many
failures, by one really magnificent achievement, it
might have gone very ill with them indeed. Cer-
tainly the total (383) looked at first as if it might
be a match-winning score, but when the Englishmen
went to the creases it soon became apparent that it
was little more than a solid-looking bulwark against
defeat in a match limited to three days. However,
this was no fault of Bardsley, who shone the brighter
because so few of his colleagues glimmered at all.
His remarkable performance of carrying his bat
through the innings for 193 —a shade over half the
total—will live in cricket history as something as
good as, if not better than, anything he ever did.
Seventeen years ago Bardsley scored two single
centuries at the Oval in a Test. Now in his 42nd
year he only just falls short of a double contury at
Lords. In his long career he has given London
quite as much occasion to remember him as Sydney.
Collins fell cheaply to Root, but Macartney (39)
helped the left-hander to add 73 for the second
■wicket. After that, although Bardsley continued to
score steadily in a style that reminded the critics of his
best days, Woodfull, Taylor, Gregory and Andrews all
came and went, barely averaging double figures apiece.
With 6 wickets down for 208, spite of Bardsley, there
was the same urgent need as has been seen so often
before on the present tour for the tail to wag. It
rose to the occasion, while enabling Bardsley to rise
still higher. Richardson (35) and Ryder (28) —how
invaluable the former has proved in big games
and small ’—helped Bardsley to pull the game through
the danger zone; 338 for 8 wickets found Australia
feeling pretty good at breakfast on Sunday. Old-
field helped with 19 on Monday and the total reached
383, Bardsley still undefeated. Four bowlers shared
the wickets, Carr ringing the changes on thpm
throughout. Tate, from whom England has been
hoping so much, bowled the most and with the least
success (2 for 105). Root and Larwood took two
■wickets apiece; Kilner’s bag of four included Old-
field and Mailey; Woolley was only given a couple
of overs. The fielding is described as good, though
Bardsley gave some hard chances, with Carr and
Hendren outstanding for proficiency; Carr’s leader-
ship is universally praised by an English press that
is getting, naturally enough, to be on the captious
side about captains.
The English team had weakened its batting strength
a trifle since the first Test by substituting Larwood
for Hearne, but Hobbs and Sutcliffe got to work at
noon on Monday as imperturbably and briskly as if
they were continuing * their not-out innings at
Trent Bridge. If England cannot field an inter-
national team nowadays without a few “rabbits” at
the batting end, there is some set-off in having an
opening pair like the Ilobbs-Sutcliffe duo, for the
bowling is quite liable to look frayed by the time
they have finished with it, and with one or two free
hitters to follow the tail-enders’ deficiencies become
immaterial. Hobbs and Sutcliffe added another to
their memorable first-wicket partnerships by putting
182 on the board before being separated. Richardson
brought about the separation by clean-bowling the
Yorkshireinan (82) and a little later the same player
caught Hobbs (119) off' Macartney. After that
Woolley (50 n. 0.) and Hendren (42 n. 0.) raised the
total to 297 when stumps were drawn on Monday.
Five bowlers were tried ; both Mailey and Richardson
respectively kept down the scoring and the batsmen
on the defensive, but Gregory’s punch seems to have
gone.

British golfers got a dreadful doing in the
contest for their open championship at the Lytharn
and St. Annes course, Lancashire. Americans filled
eight of the first 12 places, Bobby Jones winning with
a score of 291. Watrous (293) was second, Hagen
(295) third and Mitchell, the Briton, fourth; our own
Tommy Howard (316) was 22nd and Kirkwood (310 v
was 17th. Kirkwood, who is qualifying for American
citizenship, is willing to revisit, his native country,
and bring Hagen with him, for a consideration —
£4OOO for two months in Australia has been men-
tioned. The young man was always shrinkingly
modest.

Sydney Rugby League enthusiasts rolled
up 30,000" strong at the Cricket Ground to see the
meeting of South Sydney and University. South won
all the way by 20 points to 5 ; its forwards concen-
trated on breaking up the Uni. inside backs, who
went to bits under the vigorous hammering, though
Lane, at half-back, fought hard. Finch, on the left
wing, and Carr, in the forwards, were in great form
for the premiers. Though it got liftle of the ball
from the scrum, Glebe beat Newtown, 21 to 5. the
Newtown back division proving hopelessly ineffective.
Western Suburbs spanked North Sydney by 29 to 6,
while St. George astonished itself by licking Balmain,
12 to 10, after ’Main had led nearly all the way.
In the Rugby Union’s trial matches, the First XV
was overcome by the Second, though only by 19
points to 18. The Seconds had a rare forward side,
and kept the ball consistently away from the tine
opposition back division.- Soccer players began the
second round of their premiership competition, and
on a good day for Sydney teams, Gladesville beat
the leaders, Balgownie, by 2 goals to 1. Under
Australian Rules, Western Suburbs again tasted defeat,
Eastern Suburbs winning by 74 points to 47.
Lawton and Wallace, the former, Oxford stars, have
been included in the N.S.W. side to meet the All
Blacks on July 10, as also has Ross, the Uni. full-
back. A surprise is the dropping of that great
scoring winger, Grossman, whose lack of weight prob-
ably told against him. Mingay’s claim for the half-
back position was also passed over, perhaps for the
same reason. The side is very solid; the fair-
weather player is conspicuous by his absence. It
may not beat the All Blacks, but it should give a
good account of itself.
* * * *
Despite a drizzling rain, which made con-
ditions beastly for botli players and lookers-on,
about 30,000 of the latter dug up £.950 to view
the collision of Carlton and Oollingwood on the
former’s ground. The man who could keep his fiet
and got first to the ball did most of the damage.
Carlton had the better pace, and its marking—when
it did mark —was superior, so the Magpies went
down for the second time this season, being now
second to Geelong: Carlton, 70 points; ’Wood, 49.
Fitzroy crashed before Geelong, who scored 84 points
to 69 ; and St. Hilda and North Melbourne slithered
about in a Scotch mist for two hours, at the end of
which Saints had collected 47 points while North
was gathering 33. Richmond moved as sprightly
as the ground would allow and notched 67 points
to Footscray’s 56. Essendon, smarting under three
successive defeats, visited South Melbourne, and
returned with more smart, the Red-and-whites having
the bigger say throughout the argument: South, 69;
’Hon, 57. Also Melbourne discourteously raked in
154 points to Hawthorn’s 1.3, but nobody seems
certain whether this was a League match or •*«
abstruse joke.

THE INKY WAY.
Brisbane Courier was 80 on June 20.
But it didn't always carry its present name
—it was the Morkton Bay Coukier in its
earlier years. It is the one Australian daily
whose principal shareholders live in England.
But that doesn’t make much difference, since
whatever managing-director J. J. Knight says
goes. He almost grew up on the paper.
“Hugh Stone”: Gone to join the heavenly
press, Martin Robertson, who was connected
with the South Coast Times, Wollongong
(N.S.W.), for four decades. He was a
genial soul who, coming to Australia from
Scotland as a youth, developed a genuine'
love for Australian literature and sought to
pass the love on to others. He was 71 at
the finish. His thin, small body will be
missed from Wollongong streets and the
local kirk.
Queensland has established a State Re-
porting Bureau, absorbing Hansard staff,
court shorthand-writers and the clerks and
stenographers at Parliament House. The
object of the bureau, which started opera-
tions on July 1. is to provide an efficient
staff for Parliament, the law courts, Board
of Trade, Royal Commissions, etc., and to
provide- stenographic assistance to members
of Parliament. James Brennan, principal
Hansard reporter, is head of the new
bureau.
“Bulimba”: Queensland journalists are
perturbed at the invasion of their calling
by public servants, club secretaries and others
who add to their incomes by doing work
upon which the journalist depends for liis
living. The reporting of sporting events,
other than horseracing, is practically mono-
polised by outsiders, whose chief recom-
mendation is that they do the work very
cheaply. The A.J.A. is raising the slogan
“Journalism for Journalists." and is calling
a special meeting to deal with the matter.
•‘O. McKay M.” : Melbourne is witnessing
a drift ‘from the 'Varsity to the newspapers.
S. C. Lazarus, doctor of philosophy at 25,
Vic. Rhodes Scholar, who went to the
Herald from his philosophy lectureship, lias
forsaken the Inky Way after a short experi-
ence, but the drift the other way continues.
Joan Finlasos, formerly the Herald’s
"Varsity correspondent and ex-editress or
the students’ weekly Farrago, has just
made her debut in the Syme establishment,
where she is looking after the women's and
children's pages. K. R. Mackenzie, a young
man who lately acquired a first-class degree
in languages, is serving the Herald until
he leaves for Europe, and the same paper
has acquired Donald Thomson. B.Sc.
“Wynkyn de Wowse” : I should be an
ass not to acknowledge the. tremendous suc-
cess of the stunt from a circulation point ot
view; yet, at the* risk of being thought
squeamish, I can’t help thinking that the
Sydney Guardian’s female beauty competi-
tion has had some very objectionable sur-
roundings. One of them was the laying of
• odds against the chane'es of the remaining
contestants at a Sydney pony meeting last
week, coupled with' a public exhibition or
their photographs before the usual "pony
crowd. Presumably the young women who
are ready to publicly advertise their charms
have a proper contempt for false modesty,
but if they had heart! the. comment on their
points, as viewed by the eyes of racecourse
“heads,” they might have thought the price
too heavy for this sort of celebrity.
Brisbane Courier held a review of its
veterans on its 80th birthday, and awarded
the long-service medal to Chas. Melton, ot
the Queenslander, who lias completed 68
years with the paper. Among other old-
timers are 11. C. C. Woodhouse (publisher),
51 years; three others in the publishing de-
partment, 45 years each ; W. J. Dwyer, 49
years; Major-General Spencer Browne and
F. Garland (day overseer), 44 years; C. H.
Briggs (general manager) and W. J. Buza-
cott (editor of Queenslander), 43 years:
J. J. Knight (chairman of directors) and
R. Dunn (head reader), 42 years. R. San-
derson Taylor (editor of Courier) is just
getting used to the olfice after 38 years’ ser-
vice ; and C. R. J. Dahl (chief of staff)
heads a big field of-also-rans on the 25 to
35 years’ mark.
“N.P.”: A bill has lately been intro-
duced in the House of Commons defining the
obligations and liabilities of writers who
use the names of living persons for charac-
tors in fiction. The burden of proof that
damage has been sustained is laid upon the
owner of the name, who must also show
intention or negligence on the part of the
author. This seems fair enough ; if I write
a story, long or short, and call some
character in it Henry Jones, it is unreason-
able for the Mr. H. Jones who lives in my
suburb to suppose that he is being carica-
tured or held up to public derision. On the
other hand, only at very absent-minded
author indeed could be. justified in calling a
character Stanley Bruoe and expecting people
to think he meant nothing by it. By way
of carrying the war into the enemies’ coun-
try, one of the Sitwells prefaced a recent
book by the challenge: “Any living person
imagining that anything in this book refers
to him will be prosecuted” !
T. E. Rofe’s quarrel with the Sydney
Guardian threatens to be the most expen-
sive little bit of trouble of the kind that
any Australian paper ever fell into. After
Joynton Smith had won a sort of victory
in Australia Itofe decided to go to the Privy
Council; and it was as the newspapei s
adviser that Dr. Evatt-rsince a figure at the
Labor Migration Conference—went off to
Europe. Before the Privy Council a very
strong and expensive Bar was engaged (Hol-
man, K.C., was Rofe’s junior). The Couit
said rather tartly, and after a very brief
hearing, that in some respects it was a tool
of a verdict that had been given m Australia,
and ordered a new trial “with costs. It is
the “with costs” that is causing the present
trouble. Nobody knows what the ordei
means, and the cables have been buzzing m
the effort to find out. The Rofe party ot
course says it means that they get their costs
Horn the start of the proceedings-a matter
of £lO,OOO. The Guardian s hope is that
it means only that the costs of the Privy
Council proceedings have been awarded Rote.
and that those of the, N.S.W. proceedings
will hang upon the verdict in t-h • new tuai.


Vincent Lopez
"My toes just can’t keep still
when Lopez plays a fox-trot.”
The Giant, of Jazz [
WHEN Jazz first burst on an astonished world it was crude, rough,
disordered Its producers did not understand it ; nor did the
players, nor did the public.
But a decade of development has made Jazz "something else again.’* It fills its own
appointed place in the musical scheme of things. Now, there are many fine exponents
of Jazz, on the piano And the greatest of them all is Lopez.
When this harlequin of the keyboard plays for the Ampico, his performance is caught
exactly, unerringly The re-enactment through Beale-Ampico is the real Lopez. Ask
him for an encore, when you will. He’ll give it again and again. Not a bar, not a
note, not a shading ever different from the original
Great to listen to, greater still to dance to—jazz is a tonic and an exhilaration. Not till
you hear Lopez do you know it at its best. And he plays it only for the Ampico.
As fine a master in his own sphere as the leading exponents of the orthodox, Lopez is a
possession always within your reach. Use him, when and how you will. He’ll beat a
rhythm into your blood that will set your feet a-cruise on a blue sea of delight. He’ll
make you tingle with the joy of living
BEALE-AMPICO
brings this priceless service to devotees of the dance, home-makers and others. It offers
all the latest dance music played by the ablest exponents of rhythm, including (in ad-
dition to Lopez) Ferdie Grofe, Adam Carroll, J. Milton Delcamp, Ralph Reichentha and
others who record their playing exclusively for the Ampico.
NOT ONLY DANCE MUSIC
Of course dance music is not the only thing that
the Beale-Ampico provides it brings also the
playing of the greatest pianists in the world,
Godowsky, Rachmaninoff, Levitzki, Ornstein,
Schnitzer and hosts of others.
INVITATION TO HEAR IT
It is impossible to describe the Beale-Ampico —
you must hear it to appreciate how marvellous it is
—come at your convenience and spend a pleasant
half hour listening to a programme of your own
choosing, in the Beale Salon or at any of our
Branch Addresses.
Exchange your piano for a Bcalc-Anipico
The Beale-Ampico may be yours to-day. A moderate initial payment, and the
value of your present instrument deducted from the price, and the balance

Last Thursday at Sydney Town Hall
Percy Grainger, playing at being a typhoon
of the piano, whipped up heavy seas of
sound; then lie rustled over the sunlit shal-
lows of the Bach-Liszt Fantasia and Fugue
for organ in G Minor. Having brilliantly
interpreted Bach in a manner highly pleas-
ing to the shade of that often-misunderstood
composer, the player rippled into the Chopin
Sonata in B Minor. Melody, vivacity, sus-
tained sweetness and a highly-charged finale,
with all the little wayside graces in which
Chopin excels, were revealed by the facile
fingers ; and followed as an encore Chopin’s
brilliant Polonaise in A. Of the set of
modern works on this first musical menu,
Fannie Dillon's “Birds at Dawn” had a
slightly moulting sound, while R. Nathaniel
Dett’s “Juba” didn’t matter one way or
the other. Grainger’s own “Colonial Song”
lias none of that up-and-doing atmosphere
that must necessarily be tlie pioneer spirit,
but his “Country Gardens” (a Morris
dance) is a frolicsome measure full of un-
reasoning joy and tossing breezes, and de-
served the loud hand that was its reward.
The sensuous Liszt “Liebestraum” and the
reusing “Islamey,” by Balakireff, the Russ.,
ended the comprehensive programme.
* * * *
Delicacy, lightness, dignity and a mag-
nolia-like smoothness —they were all in the
Partita in B Flat Major of Bach with which
the pianist opened on Saturday. Before the
fluent fingers the difficulties of the Schumann
Symphonic Studies (Op. 13) melted as mist
before the sun. Debussy, Albeniz, Balfour
Gardiner and Grainger himself were other
writers whose music was given with the
freshness .of outlook and lucidity which in-
duces in his listeners a complacent feeling
that the great composers are not only easy
to play, but easy also to understand.
“H.M.S. PINAFORE,” AT MELBOURNE
MAJESTY'S.
Bernard Manning as Dick Deadeye.
Sunday, brought up with a rough idea of
justice and right by the four rugged but
honest miner-mates of her dead father, is
prepared t<> scotch the serpent when she
finds out that the intentions of the waster
Arthur Brinthorpe are strictly dishonorable.
.Tacky, one of the matca however, saves her
the trouble, and puts a bullet into the ne’er-
do-well. The shooting complicates matters
when Sunday, having passed from a convent
school, goes on ,to the care of an aunt in
England, and meets Colonel Henry Brin-
thorpe, the waster’s brother. The love be-
tween the decent Binthorpe and the girl is
sincere, but she feels that she can’t marry
him 'without confessing her knowledge of his
brother’s death, and she can’t confess that
without betraying .Tacky; wherefore she bolts
.for the wild woods and her old guardians
again. Naturally neither Brinthorpe nor the
author is willing to let the story die there,
and the death of a man who was only a
nuisance to everybody proves a very small
obstacle for the good horse Happiness to
leap. The robust, wholesome drama, staged
too long ago to be familiar to the present
generation, was a favorite of the Tittell
Brune period; and the audience at Sydney
Palace gave a good welcome to a good revival
by the Nellie Bramley co.
* * * *
Nellie Bramley made the camp-bred girl
adored by her guardians quite believable:
and the other parts were reasonably well
done. Rutland Beckett was better suited
than usual as Towser, one of the miners,
and Jack McGowan was amusing as the half-
witted but useful Lively. George Cross,
however, was not inspiring as the middle-
aged lover, Colonel Henry Brinthorpe; and
Nellie Ferguson, whose clear enunciation is
always a joy, gave Sister Agatha a smile
which was rather that of an agreeable matron
than a benignant saint.
❖ * ❖ *
“The Silver King” also had its revival
on Saturday: it gives Frank IJarvey his fare-
well appearances in Sydney at the Royal.
The useful actor would have ranged himself
with the best-remembered in the part if he
had lived up to his Wilfred Denver of the
introduction. Harvey was excellent in the
scene in which the ordinarily decent young
fellow, thrown off his balance by booze and
betting, recklessly plunges himself into diffi-
culty; but as the greying-haired Silver King
returned with a fortune he lapsed at times
into a staginess which spoilt the balance of
his work. Remy Carpen gave a few indi-
cations of the difficulty the modern actress
has of treating the parts written for another
era, but supplied valuable assistance. J. B.
Atholwood was the faithful Jaikes who
shares the starvation; Hei-bert Leigh, the
slimy old scoundrel Coombes ; Mayne Lynton,
the Spider; Arthur Greenaway, Geoffrey
Ware; and G. Kay Souper, Detective Baxter.
They were good; John Fernside, as the Cock-
ney, Henery Corkett, was doughy.
❖ * 5k *
On Saturday night Sydney will be able
to give Dot Brunton a welcome in drama.
G. B. Post’s return to the Palace with
“The Climax” affords the opportunity.
❖ ❖ ❖ ❖
“The Last of Mrs. Cheyney” wears its
necklace of verbal brilliants at; the Criterion
Theatre; warm applause for “Rose Marie”
takes the chill off the winter evenings at Her
Majesty’s; "No, No, Nanette,” applies the
double-barelled denial to any thought of an
imminent cessation at St. James’s; and “Our
Liz,” distributing plain, honest humor at the
Grand Opera House, is laughing its way
into the hearts of a larger public.
sk 5k >k 5k
A number of Sydney Tivoli changes leave
Frankie Heath the brightest thing in the
heavens, _ although the well-trained dogs,
“Gautier's Bricklayers,” always score large
applause. No doubt because Gautier has
keen stung by recent assertions that cruelty
is necessarily associated with the training of
animals for the stage, the regular perform-
ances is interrupted every now and then to
show how fond these pets are of their owner.
David Mansfield, who sang in the Sydney
streets until he was discovered by a broad-
casting company, was billed foi- Monday,
but failed to puffin an appearance; and
Rupert Hazel provided some informal merri-
ment instead. George Lee, branded as a
comedian, is very nearly funny at times; and
Maxim Brodi, with Gil Dech at: the piano,
provides concert items of a popular variety.
Fuller s Theatre audiences are a friendly
crowd, and don’t care how much they show
it; and Claude Dampior got the welcome of
an old pal when he made his Sydney re-
appearance on Saturday. With that to help,
the comedian, who can assume a look of
inanity which- makes even the inanity funny,
could hardly go wrong; and he didn’t.

A feeling that the Sydney Hippodrome
show is a vital factor in the lives of the
kiddies has caused the management to plunge
into twice-a-day performances during the
school holidays. So young Tom and Betty,
whose bedtime now may be 7 or 8, will have
a chance to sec Chefalo's magic and the
miniature vaudeville of the Midgets without
losing any sleep.

Etchers and colorists: —
The Australian Painter-Etchers’ Society has staged
an impressive Sydney show, running to 160 offerings,
at the Education Gallery,' strengthening it with a dis-
play of work loaned from the collections of the Chief
Justice, Dr. Andrew Davidson and Watt, K.C.—the,
last-named such an enthusiastic collector that he goes
on buying long after his house overflowed. These
extras include some quaint studies by Livingston
Hopkins. Of the exhibition proper some strong work
comes from honorary members of the Society in Eng-
land, the most notable being Percival Haskell, R.E.,
whose feeling for distance and the drama of atmo-
sphere is admirable. The Trustees of the National
Gallery have purchased his “Lonely Tower” and Sir
Frank Short’s “Yorkshire Dell,” good selections both;
and from the local artists they have taken Syd Long’s
“The an excellently-composed work carried
out with strong decorative effect, and the “Ambleside
Farmyard” of Sydney Ure Smith, a picture with a
nice balance of light and shade not evident in all of
Smith’s exhibits. The most prolific contributor is
Herbert Gallop, in whose score of exhibits a nice feel-
ing for foliage and some dreadful cows are shown; an
uncatalogued exhibit of T. Friedensen, a strongly-done
picture of a. church building with massive walls in
Harfleur, is his most attractive contribution, although
‘lhe Road to Fairy Bower” has alluring qualities.
Will Ashton has three well-done European studies;
Jessie Traill shows her usual virile engineering work
(what a curious lady this is, with her love of look-
ing out upon cranes and dynamos!) ; Henry Fullwood,
"ROSE MARIE,”

George Bryant as Black Eagle, and James
Hughes as Sergeant Malone.
whose work is disappointing, shows best in “Wiseman's
Ferry,” John Shu-low, with only two exhibits, ex-
presses a great deal of delicacy .in “The Bank Door’’ ;
the “Australian Sunrise” of Bruce Henderson is firm,
breezy work; and Janies Crisp (mainly bird studies),
Helen Farmer, E. Warner (whose composition shows
weakness), Erie Scott, E. Sydney Walker (prone to
heavy contrasts’ of shadows and light) and W. G. Reid
are amongst the other contributors.
In his show at the Macquarie Gallery, Norman
Lloyd drenches his pictures with crude colors, giving
results sometimes effective, sometimes garish; but
the devotion he formerly gave to ships is now
transferred to Sydney Harbor foreshores, mainly
about Cremorne and Mosman. The one ship picture
is “From Iquique,” an ambitious canvas, which,
however, leaves the feeling that it is merely waiting
for the words of the advertisement- to be painted
across the sky. The ambition to be original and
striking is in most of the canvases; in “Silvery
Light,” an effect of flooded moonlight on cloud and
night-shadowed landscape, he succeeds delightfully.
For this and several more, including “A Tranquil
Morning” (No. 29) and “The Sky Over the City”
(No. 5), in which the sunlight on the higher terra-
cotta roofs and also the distant mists are well pro-
duced, he can be forgiven others.

The only important thing Mona Mcßurney
forgot when she wrote her grand opera.
“The Dalmatian,” which was performed at
the Melbourne Playhouse on Friday, was
to make the story cohere. Founded on a
Marion Crawford novel, the melodious de-
bate opens with Marietta (Elizabeth Pin-
schof) being pledged, in a Venetian garden
planted with Australian bluegums, to marry
into the noble house of Contarini. Zorzi.
her glassmaking father's Workman, conceal-
ing his passion for the lady, sets out to con-
vey her promise and falls into a nest of
aristocratic plotters instead. Having decided
that: the play is now going to revolve round
political intrigue, the spectator is next intro-
duced to Arisa, a Greek slave, and Aristarchi,
a pirate, who proceed tunefully to conspire
to burgle Marietta’s dowry. Whether they
succeed in their enterprise is not divulged,
since the next act, in its excitement over the
preparation of Marietta's trousseau, forgets
all about them. The glassmaker entrusts
the secret of his craft to Zorzi, and Zorzi is
wrongfully arrested for stealing the secret.
In an eniloaue the matter is more or less
cleared up and Marietta marries Zorzi.
* * * *
It is a pitv Miss Mcßurney essayed the
almost impossible task of setting the ramb-
ling Marion Crawford to music instead of
finding some simpler theme on which to
string the pearls of her undoubtedly dis-
tinguished harmonies. Owing to the indis-
position of Alberto Zelman, who w r as to have
led his symphony orchestra, the said har-
monies started on Friday under serious
disadvantages; it says much for the
quality of the composer’s music that
a solitary piano (ably manipulated by Mrs.
Alexander Raff) was able to see the evening
through. Several seductive lyrics, some fine
-declamatory passages and a number of robust
choruses adorned the tale. Elizabeth Pin-
sell qf, lacking the vocal inches of a prima
donna, was nevertheless a highly artistic
Marietta, and Raymond Carey adored her
with a rich voice and in a pretty manner.
Alexander Raff, in a buffo part, aired a pair
of shy legs and a sympathetic voice about
Marietta’s garden. Feme Boyle was a pleas-
antly melodious nurse and Arnold Bartolini
a perfectly incomprehensible pirate. The
young ladies of the Albert-street Conserva-
torium provided some comic relief as ’prentice
boys in costumes presumably of the period,
and they and their male helpers rendered the
choruses in a manner that earned the loud
hooray.
v *l* - ‘l'
On Saturday the curtain rose at the
King’s, Melbourne, on “White Cargo” and
the west coast of Africa —the most dubious-
looking rubber-land this investor has ever
seen. The attached bungalow is a slummy
sort of and the rubber-planters
and their friends are a slummy-looking lot.
There are four of them. One is the man-
ager, who has been out seven years and has
become a dilapidated cynic; another is a
famous London surgeon who left Harley-
street after operating with unfortunate re-
sults while drunk; the third is a missionary
who shows traces of the prevailing damp-rot,
and the fourth is an assistant in an advanced
state of decomposition. The only savory
member of the community is Tondeleyo, a
half-caste native beauty. Into this cheerless
community is injected the new assistant. The
chocolate lady promptly proceeds to vamp
him; and the play closes with the climate
still in possession and prepared with un-
abated vigor to set about the disintegration
of its latest victim.
* * * *
Leon Gordon, who is sometimes said to
have written the play, also takes the leading
role of cynical chorus to his unkempt collec-
tion. He reveals himself as a very unequal
genius. He is one moment a quiet, efficient
manipulator of his audience, and the next
u merely average strutting barnstormer. His
play is by turns an absorbing drama of the
psychologies and a piece of tawdry stage
romanticising. Of the others the doctor, por-
trayed with much emotion by Wallis Clark, is
a monument of pathos in the Bland Holt
manner; and Tondeleyo (made suitably
salacious by Helen Stransky) is a heroine
out of the Thousand and One Nights.

At Hoyt’s Melbourne house this week
Thomas Meighan, in “Irish Luck.” is a
Bowery cop who wins a popularity competi-
tion and is rewarded with a free passage
to the Isle. Good scenery and comedy make
the picture acceptable. The Majestic combines
Irene Rich as “A Lost Lady,” and Eleanor
Boardman in “An Exchange of Lives,” and
—in the flesh—Amy Rochelle is providing
entertainment between the celluloid explo-
sions.

The public realise, from practical experience, that if a car is to carry fi we passengers
over every kind of road, to climb hills, to go from one end of the country to the
other, without strain and undue wear and tear, it must have ample power.
Power is a vital factor in the performance and life of any car. The Crossley I 5/30
Top-Gear Car has more than sufficient for Interstate Touring, yet at the same time
is phenomenally economical to run, and the maintenance costs are practically nil.

Melbourne’s Little Art Co., in its latest
season, provided, amongst other things, an
interesting rendering of Ibsen’s “Hedda Gab-
ler.” The well-knit story of the woman who
is condemned to watch the man she loves,
with the assistance of another lady, bringing
into the world the child of his mind, a book,
while she must wait the statutory period to
present her own hated lord with a mortal
pledge of her disaffection, was told with
considerable intelligence, especially by the
femLiine portion of the congregation. Beres-
fo'rd Fowler’s necktie —he was the literary
Don Juan —registered more emotion than
liis manner; and Claude Thomas, as Hedda’s
husband, was imbued overmuch with the
importance of being earnest. Bnt when Ruby
May, as his wife; Mrs. Fannie Fowler, very
delightfully his aunt; and Gwen Apted, a
genuinely troubled Mrs. Elvsted, were in sole
possession of the theme, the ribald critic
was forced to forget that the Queen’s Hall
is about the size of a suburban parlor, that
the proscenium x-esembles a Punch and Judy
stand nopulated by a race of giants, and that
the bell used to scare the faded curtain out
of the way humorously x-ecalls a boarding-
house summons to bi-eakfast. The women
were outstanding. If Ruby May, in particu-
lar, would cancel some gestures she has
copied from the legitimate stage, she would
become a very fine ai’tist of the emotions.

Not since the Verbrugghen Qxxartette
showed Melbourne audiences the possibilities
of chamber music has this city heard such
liarmonioxxs strains from a combination of
strings as were produced by the ladies of
the Kendall Quartette. Several years of
study together have produced a perfect unison
of thought and techniqxxe. Leader Katherine
Kendall, who gathered her little party to-
gether about five years ago, adds interest to
the numbers given by a preliminary word
or two regarding their construction. Com-
mencing with Beethoven and Dvorak, the
programme climbed down the ages to such
moderns as Joseph Speaight and J. C. Mc-
Ewen. Speaight’s Shakspearean pieces,.
“The Lonely Shepherd” and a sparkling
melody which irresistibly suggested “Puck”
were much liked; and McEwen’s sinister
descriptive sketches, “The Dhu Lock” and
“Red Murdoch,” earned a recall, responded
to by a piece with a rustic flavor by Julius
Harrison.

Vaudeville patrons who like their music
to .stand on its head and wiggle its toes are
being well catered for at Melbourne Tivoli.
Niobe. who retires under water to sing,
arrived on Monday; Brian LawrencC is a
frail-looking lad who produces from a meagre
torso a surprisingly grown-up voice; Jones
and Raine are extracting more or less melo-
dious noises from a weakened supply of
beer; and Coram, ventriloquist , is singing
by proxy. Eddie and Decima Maclean are
not Novikoff and Pavlova, but they are clever
f»ervislies. And a bandy-legged pair calling
themselves the Ghezzis become, when twisted
up together, miracles of grace and athletic
ingenuity.

According to Ermyntrude Avery the lives
of the gi'eat musicians were as sweet and
untroubled as a Marcus Stone picture. If
they ever threw the rice-pudding at the cook
or cast a questing eye on the landlady’s
daughter, the matter isn’t recorded in their
compositions. Provided these axioms are
accepted, Miss Avery’s pianoforte recitals,
with spoken nai-rative, at Melbourne Assem-
bly Hall, will give genuine delight. The
lady has a curious trick of lighting up an
inanimate pose with the fire of an inward
enthusiasm, although her melodious illustra-
tions are not as interesting as her talk. The
series had already been rapturously receiyed
by juveniles in the subui’bs. Its extension
to Mum and Dad should do them good.

Another Melbourne picture show:—
AV. M. Whitney, of Sydney, who was a confrere of
Hilder, is displaying landscapes at the Atlieimmi.
His muse, one feels, is too gentle a creature for this
rough world. “Farmlands, Bathurst,” and “Tall
Timber, Huon,” however, are delightful little lyrics:
and the white bridge and visionary gums of STo. 3
strike a pleasant harmony.

Adelaide Royal is just taking the long step
from the gloomy and frank-spoken “White
Cargo” to the gentle humor and sentiment of
Barrie; and Clem Dawe, one of the briskest
lmmorists this city has seen, is moving on
from the Majestic, where lxe has had a long
season. In pictures “The White Sistei\_”
at Wondergrapli, is doing remarkable busi-
ness, showing that the taste for sob-stuff is
as strong as ever. By way of variety the
York has Norma Talmadge in “Graustark,”
the American idea of a Ruritanian kingdom,
West’s gives a-fire-alarm picture with real
thrills, and the Pav. shows Tom Mix com-
plete with horse.
Poverty
Point
“Nero”: Frank Harvey lias played lead
longer than any other actor who has visited
these shores —in my time at all events —nor
has anyone nlayed “opposite” a greater
number of leading ladies. Kicking oft' in
1915 as lead in “The Man Who Stayed at
Home,” he had Violet Paget (Mrs. Hugh
Buckler) for leading lady. Followed “Kick
In” and “Under Fire,” with Charlotte Ives
and (for part of the rm> of t lifi latter
Lizette Parkes; “On Trial,” “Romance” and
ALWAYS TAKE MOTHER'S ADVICE.
“I owe my success as a motion-picture actor to my matah,
don’tchcrknow.'
“Ah, yes, I know —told you to be seen and not heard. Mine
does, too.”
“The Land of Promise,” with Madge Fabian ;
“The House of Glass,” with Florence Rock-
well ; “Good Gracious, Annabelle” and “Mrs.
Dot,” with Marie Tempest; and “The Bird of
Paradise,” with Muriel Starr. Then came a
brief engagement with Hugh D. Mclntosh,
w r hen Harvey impersonated the Devil, with
Vera Pearce, in “My Lady Frayle.” Lent to
the Firm, he appeared w T ith Marie Ney in
“The Luck of the Navy,” and after a further
tour with Marie Tempest he was with Maude
Mannaford in “Scandal.” After that he
figured in “My Lady’s Dress,” “The Lie,”
“The Flaw” and “French Leave,” all with
Emelie Polini. “The Garden of Allah” and
“East of Suez” saw him again with Muriel
•Starr; and in “Bpaucaire” and “The Peli-
can” he assisted at the professional d6but
of Mrs. Pitt Rivers. The notable list con-
cludes with “Seventh Heaven” and “The Sil-
ver King,” with Remy Carpen as his hero-
ine. I think his best work was done in
“My Lady’s Dress”; his Italian, Cockney
and Dutch fop were wonderful character
studies.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Sir Barry Jackson’s
daring experiment of producing “Hamlet”
in modern dress has led to a new train of
thought and stage adventure. Many con-
noisseurs condemned the innovation; others,
a very few admittedly, upheld it and con-
tended that they had been able to under-
stand much that was vague before, and to
discover new beauties. This minority is
growing. The scheme has been tried on the
Continent with success. The Birmingham
Grand Opera Society interested an enthush
astic audience with a production of “Faust’
in which the artists wore the clothes of
to-day. The British Empire Shakspeare
Society followed suit at the Haymarket when
Edith Craig—daughter of Ellen Terry—
produced an abridged version of “The Mer-
chant of A r enice” with most impressive
effect. Writing of this last venture Hubert
Hughes said: “The acting of Shakspeare as
though his plays were modern, and as though
his people were actual people, seems to me
incomparably the best way. Where it fails
is where Shakspeare himself fails.”
Recently New York had the interesting ex-
perience of two simultaneous productions of
“Hamlet” —at the National Theatre in mod-
ern dress, and at Hampden’s Theatre, higher
up Broadway, in classic raiment.
“Hamfat”: H. W. Varna, instructor and
organiser of an amateur co. which gives per-
formances about Sydney, supplied one of
Australia’s early experiences of the “per-
doocer,” who has pushed the one-time
supreme stage-manager from old glory
into a position of mere utility. Varna came
to Australia to produce “The Darling of the
Gods” for J. C. Williamson: lie had been
associated with the London version. He was
subseauently s.-m. for Julius Knight, and,
while that star was ill, played parts, notably
Nero in “The Sign of the Cross” —irrever-
ently referred to by mummers as “The Sign,”
just as if it was a pub. He is a competent
theatrical drill-sergeant, and has run some
professional touring shows of his own.
“Hamfat”: There was some real drama at-
one Sydney performance of “The Misleading-
Lady.” After the fall of the curtain on the
knock-out scene, Nellie Bramley’s voice,
high-pitched and tragical, pierced the cloth
with "Oh, but I’m
sure I’ve hurt him!
He's bleeding!” In
swinging her table-
telephone weapon
at Rutland Bec-
kett, Nellie had
caught him on the
“point.” Although
he made light of
the mishap,. there
was genuine gore
in the actor’s make-
up when he went
on again.
“Curtain-raiser”:
Those of . us who
took a sporting or
intellectual interest
in Allan Wilkie’s
attempt to create
a world’s record
for Australia by
producing all the
39 plays of Shaks-
peare were grieved
to hear of his
ro 11 e n luck in
losing all his pro-
perties in a fire at
the Mechanics’ In-
stitute, Geelong.
The stuff had only
been moved in the
night before, and
“Hamlet” was to
soliloquise next
evening. Wilkie’s,
unfortunately, is a
dead loss- —he had
never made enough
to afford insurance.
Watt, M.H.R., is
heading a move-
ment to equip the
co. (now tempo-
rarily disbanded) with a new lot of props, by
public subscription.
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) : The Paris
stage, in a sudden and almost mysterious
manner, has been vitalised, and to-day that city
is once more the theatrical capital of Europe.
The conventions which had a rigid rule for
every shade of playwriting, acting and pro-
ducing—and excellent rules they were within
limits—have almost all been swept aside.
Plays of all periods, by Russian, English,
Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Scandinavian
writers, are being regularly performed; even
the Com€die Francaise and the Od6on make
gestures of generous capitulation to' the de-
mands of the new spirit. During the past
two years there have been considerably more
Shakspearean revivals in Paris than in
London ; incidentally, the Parisian season of
Ruggero Ruggeri—of which “Hamlet” was
the high light—was far more successful than
that in London. Indeed, with all the sup-
port of a generous press and a popular and
enterprising management, the London visit
of the illustrious Italian actor was a com-
plete failure, and could not be spun out even
for three weeks. In Paris not only is any
work of merit sure of a hearing, but it is
also sure of a staging in which originality,
audacity, subtlety and imagination are given
rein. Synopses are printed on all pro-
grammes, so that the interest of the audience,
instead of being centred on the plot, is trans-
ferred to the consideration of a definite
problem or situation.
“C.Q.”: The shadow-show is steadily
approaching the time when it will be a more
or less perfect reproduction of the legitimate
stage. Last year Sydney listened to a pri-
vate screaming of the phonofilm device, where-
by the speech of a movie actor is photo-
graphed on to the same strip as his bodily
contortions and is reproduced with perfect
synchronism by means of an ordinary radio
valve set. The thing was crude, and the
spoken words in Sydney were complicated
by a strong American accent, but it
has possibilities. The next step is to pro-
duce the appearance of roundness. This has
been done by screening two pictures taken
from the viewpoint of each eye and inviting;
the audience to look through stereoscopes
at them. Unfortunately the audience devel-
oped a habit of pocketing the stereoscopes,
and the innovation split on the rock of
finance. The latest advance is the notion of
a Roumanian, whereby the right picture is
highly and the left dimly illuminated, the
resultant single picture being stereoscopic.
Perfect color will be the next step. And
after that ?
“S.G.”: The Commonwealth censors say
they delete the following subjects from the
pitchers:—
Assaults on women, indecent and vulgar attitudes,
Hrst-night-of-marriage scenes, prostitution, drug-
taking, excessive brutality in any form-, executions,
murders if depicted in revolting detail, travesties of
religion, the advocacy of free love, scenes of child-
birth, excessive shooting, and scenes in brothels.
But "assaults on women" are repeatedly sug-
gested all the same. Though details are cut
out the beginnings of the business and the
rescue of the reeling female are shown : a
film called “Siberia,” in which the heroine’s
hair is shingled long before the war, offers
a case in point. I suppose this morbid addic-
tion to the rape theme is one more sign that
Sambo is avenging himself on Sam. It is !
only a step from nigger music and nigger
dances to nigger ideas of sex. In my opin-
ion the wrong side won the Civil War.
“Whiteway” (N’York) : Many in Aus-
tralia will remember with joy the fine work
they saw Margaret Wycherly do a few years
ago. In a production here of the Dutch
masterpiece, "The Devil to Pay,” by Her-
man Heijermaus, the part of a vicious old
hag whose distorted ideas of righteousness
poison the lives of' all around her is superbly
played by her.
“E.C.”: Flicker flappers will soon be able
to revel' in a re-creation' of an old flame,
for Valentino’s latest effort is entitled “The
Sons of the Sheik.” To gather the neces-
sary atmosphere the company, a hundred
strong, pitched tents in Arizona; a chef or
two made the sojourn bearable. Alec Bennett,
brother of Enkl (Mrs. N,iblo), is assistant
producer.
“Blum”: Ever since there was such an
instrument as the pianoforte there has been
almost a consensus of opinion among its
masters that a deaf, untidy, pathetic old
man who lived at Bonn many years ago
wrote the stuff that was best worth hearing
from it. Liszt’s playing of the Moonlight
Sonata and Rubinstein’s version of the Apas-
siondta are matters of high tradition in
European conservatories. All the great
modern players—Paderewski, Carreno, De
Pachmann, Borwick, Backhaus, Rachmaninoff
—and such promising youngsters as Moisei-
witsch and Levitzky, give poor old Ludwig a
good representation in their programmes.
There’s only one front-rank pianist who has
barred Beethoven, and that is Percy Grain-
ger. It’s his own affair, of course, but it
would be interesting to hear why such an
avid lover of Bach boycotts Bach's most
gifted compatriot.
Listeners-in had a chance of seeing as
well as hearing some of the most popular of
3LO artists when a concert programme was
broadcasted from the Auditorium (Mel-
bourne) on Saturday night. The entertain-
ment, of the nature of the “popular” con-
cert —a form of enjoyment, etc., almost
extinct —was of infinite variety: there were
band selections, capital part-songs by the
Orphean Choristers, solos and recitations.
But the most thrilling feature of all was
the view in the flesh of such favorites as
Mary Gumleaf and Little Miss Kookaburra.
From an Adelaide critic: —
Follen Bishop, the English painter, who with his
wife, Florence Fitzgerald, spent several Real’s in
Adelaide, is back from Europe, and showing at the
Society of Arts- some of his work and hers. Their
water-colors are the most satisfying. Freed froth
plucky but never quite effective attempts to catch
the Australian, atmosphere, they—and especially the
male partner—show the infinite greenness and charm
of flower-studded English lanes, quiet streams
flowing bank-high through meadows, and moss-cov-
ered cottages that are islands in a sea of blossom.
Prices are tall, but this does not deter buyers.
Adelaide Art Gallery, which already has one striking
Follen Bishop, has selected another.

The New Method of Shaving
NO BRUSH. NO SOAP.
sdsdfghkl;'
Is it not strange that for hundreds of years man has
been scrubbing his face with soaps full of Soda find
has never reasoned that under such treatment the skin
must suffer> Nothing is more ugly than a face that
looks raw. Shaving soaps are always the same old method
of shaving. They are made with Soda.
But now we have discovered the natural method where
no bush,and soaps full of soda are needed. Shavex is a
skin food. One can shave in half the time, and you
wifi get a smoother and closer shave than you have ever
had, and shaving will become a pleasure instead of a tor-
ture. Your skin will look and feel like satin, and y°u f
face under this treatment will look twice as young. INo
after lotions are required when using

paration ever invented for shaving.”

Sigma: So roughly clone we wore out
two perfectly good pairs of boots in tramping through
it... .Marian: Yes,""but what did that English sample
fetch? F.X.M.: A poor bit of carpentering
William L.: Not up. .. .W.E.8.: The verse falls a long
way short.... S.W.J.: A bit too slight and loosely
constructed. Only in exceptional circumstances is it
permissible to leave lines unrhymed... .M.M.K.: The
“Kathleen” verses have feeling, hut the ideas are a
little thin; and the same is true of the “Ridel”. . . .
I’M.: The lady can take care of herself. .. .F.W.S.
That ground has been worked so often... .W.1.M.:
You left it too late. .. .R.S.: Gone down in the rush
to get in on that subject.... Peter Q.: AVell, you’re
a girl and you ought to know, but we don’t believe
you’d even think of going all that way round....
Lennox K.: On the edge; but it didn’t quite make
us believe it could be true. .. .N.D.R.: Space isn’t
available. .. .W.G.'B.: What Bedford wrote, it seems,
was “peg merchants,” not “pig merchants.” But “pig
merchants” is a very good term for people who take
up a mining block merely to send it to market.
.... .V.J.M.: Send it to the paper in which the note
appeared. .. .W.S.: Information and figures were given
some time ago.. l .C.A.H.: The convict can’t curse
here unless he does it a lot more effectively....
L.W. (Roseville): Doesn’t get to anything....
W.H.L.: The first and main excuse for any verse
is that it attempts to say something. Yours hasn’t
that excuse.... Emel: Xot enough in it.. ..K.M.:
Crude. Look up the meaning of “unchartered,” for
example.... .E.M.E.: Margaret is too slight and
commonplace. .. .Bill M.: Xot up to the knocker. .. .
Edward D.: Won’t do for this sixpenn’orth. .. .Win.
S.: The sea-serpent stuff is tedious... .E.F. (Bal-
larat) : That yarn with variations has been worked
a thousand times... .1.M.M.: Don’t care for it....
John C.: The tale doesn’t strike us... .W.M.F.: The
whole thing is weak, and the ending is out of
harmony with the rest....W.B, (Croydon): Good
idea, badly presented; boxing verse has to be counted
out. .. .W.H.L.: Neither suits... .J.I. (Ballarat):
Put some poetic corsets on your Muse; she flops all
over the place. .'. .A.C.E. :■ Not bad of its sort, but
it’s the vaudeville sort... .G.McI.: The most promis-
ing of the three lost itself in the big drought. And
the beginning was pretty dry, t 00.... Mrs. M. S.:
Humor of “Doors” rather forced. F.J.L.: Too
rough.... A.L. (Vic.): “The Wanderer” returns....
J.A.H.: The madness 'of the thing is rather too
obvious from the start. .. .P.L.C.: The story sets off
all right, but goes nowhere. .. .M.J.D.: Pleasing, but
■weak Jas. A.: Very wild and rugged... .T.J.C.:
Thanks, but it might have been more pleasantly said
without the attempt to rhynie it... .Mower Blade: You
don’t make the best of what there is of it,...
G.8.W.: A rambling yarn of little interest which
plays round a very small point.;. .R.S.A.: Nothing
in it... .N.S.M.: The horror is the exact pattern of
dozens of others; in fact, monster crabs work over-
time in the magazines... .W.A.H.: Can’t get excited
over any of them... .Ratroclus: You make no sort of
story of it.... J.S.L.: “Nym” is not for us. .. .G.H.T,:
Not much real resemblance to verse... .W.E.8.: The
suspicion yarn is not improved.... J.S.L.: All fairly
well done, but none quite up.... Chas H: The ear
that can rhyme “draw” with “before” is in need
of tuning. .. .H.E.M.: All weak, thin and imitative.
... .W.S.W.: We’ll put on our goloshes .and chance
this much of it:—
The blood did gush upon the floor.
Aghast at that that lie did done.
The murder stared until the gore
Upon l. s feet and hands did run.
Blood! Blood! Blood! Blood ! A deep remorse
With better feelings made him bleed.
“Alas!” he wept in accents hoarse,
“It is a bloody deed, indeed.”
It certainly is a bit mushy... .P.T.G.: If, at 18, you
can look back with bitter remorse on the girl you
betrayed—“in the years long past”—we’re afraid
you’re going to have a very dull future... .Gord: What
led you to the conclusion that “umbrella” is a rhyme
for “help her”?. .. .R.G.P.: Your “Clarion Call”
sounds more like the ice-cream man’s btigle. ...
R.A.W.: Not badly constructed, but not nearly
enough in it.:..G.M. (Levin): You have courage
when you try to rhyme “shore” with “Aotearoa”. ...
W. j.W.: Hacks out old commonplaces in a rough
way... .X.Y.Z.: Rather too small a point... .Annie
S'.: Too feeble to flutter to the printer, who’s up
another two flights. .. .E.M.E.: The comparison of
Napoleon to the sun drags rather heavily.... J.I.
(Ballarat) : The verse limps painfully and doesn’t
say much.... Brother Richard: You had a subject,
but you didn’t make the best of it... .N.R.A.: The
matter is very slight. And do you rhyme “water”
and “harbor” because both are wet? We’ve tried
it on “beer” and “sarsaparilla” without success....
D.R.G.: “For filthy dross I do not ask.” And you
won’t get any either, unless you do a lot better
Sandy: “Serpent” fails to bite... .Tallylio’: The verse
you ride in “The Hunt” resembles a pensioned cabhorse.
....Sol: One William Shakspeare holds the copyright
for the woman who had several husbands and was
overdone by the last:.. .R.8.G.: Just as they were to
be married she discovert that he was a murderer.
Then she discovered that he was not, and the wedding
came off. Why thrill us like that?.,. .Ola: “Wan-
dering Steed” sent to the pound... .S.Y. (Bris.):
From what quarry did you dig “Jewels of Song” ?
... .C.H. (Yass) : We’re afraid you’re too easily
annoyed. .. . A.S. (Tamworth) : “Woe-low, slave-
grave, thief-grief, tomb-gloom, dead-lead”—your
rhymes are tombstones .in a cemetery of sorrow....
Marni. S.: “Avaunt, thou trull, 1 loved thee once,
in sooth, but other lips now lure my eager youth.”
Saucy varlet! 0.5. P.: All very well to ask us
to “Send her the message of my heart,” but, beyond
saying vaguely that she’s gone above, you supply
no address.... Chick: Sorry, we can’t adopt y0u....
0.T.: “Siren” doesn’t tempt us.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
W.A.H.: Joke has sore shoulders from overwork. ~ .
T.W.W.: Send it to the paper that ran the com-
petition. .. ,M. 8.: We guessed you were only 13....
H.8.L.: King Billy will be pleased to learn that
even the crescent moon took its shape from the
boomerang. ... Your queer designs may carry
a message to numismatists; us they merely give a
headache.... K:W.C.: One is an old Cockney joke
and Hie Charleston idea is tame A.0.G.: For the
man whose wife cats biscuits under the blankets
twin beds are recommended Weary: The mala
propism in which maternity takes the place of eter-
nity has had its day .., . T.H.: Over use of an eraser
and Chinese white has given it a patched appearance.
... . C.F.: Admire your industry in cultivating the
gentlemen's poses; but there is more than noses in
art.

“Ivlaney”: Re promotion by seniority re-
gardless of fitness in Government departments
(B. 3/6/’26). On the re-classification of
the Postal Department recently a number of
expert telegraphists were promoted to the
position of postmaster. Not one had ever
worked outside an operating-room.
* * * *
“Bris.”: Brisbane whisky-drinkers have a
wide choice of brands, but in some pubs, at
least, it is all the same whisky, tyi a recent
case the licensee of a city hotel admitted that
11 bottles bearing different labels had been
filled from one cask. It wasn't bad whisky,
but the monotonous landlady was fined £l5
all the same.
* * * *
“C.”: Unlike the Black Horse at Rich-
mond and the Bush Inn at New Norfolk (B,
27/5/’26), the Red Gow at Abbotsford
(N.S.W.) has lost its original name and
raison d’etre. Its license dated from 1825, .
when it was built by James Bibb, for the
convenience of travellers along the Great
North-road. It is now the headquarters of
the Sydney Rowing .Club, and has been since
1872. Many of the old rooms remain in their
original state.
* * * *
“Bris.”: Brisbane is mildly interested in
the American claimant to the Byrne estate,
alleged to be worth 69,000,000 dollars, and
to comprise “a cash interest of 1,500,000
dollars in the Bank of Australia, Brisbane,
and real estate at Sandgate, Mackay, Korum-
burra (Vic.). Melbourne and elsewhere.”
There is no Bank of Australia in Brisbane,
and nothing is known of the alleged real-
estate holdings; so doubts are entertained
about the Byrne millions.
* * * *
“Tarago”: The new pipe-line, just com-
pleted, connecting Frankston and the West-
ern Port Naval Base (Vic.) with the Bun-
yip River, provides the second inducement
for manufacturing firms to invade Gippsland.
Already the cables of the' Morwell electric
scheme are completed, and run almost side
by side with the water-line for miles. These
two great essentials to industrial develop-
ment, coupled with the fact that there are
thousands of acres of cheap land within a
few hours of Melbourne, should help a little
towards decentralisation.
* * * #
“Nitclievo”: A car-wrecking co. has reached
Melbourne to conduct a business similar to
that of the man who buys worn-out horses
and converts them into glue, oil, leather,
bristles and catgut for fiddles. These new
chiffoniers bny an old motor-car for a song
and take it to pieces. From the body they
strip cushions, leather, windscreens, lamps,
horns, hoods, all readily saleable at motor-
repairing shops. The chassis yields up the
radiator, the engine, all the connections and
every bit of tin, lead, copper, iron and wood
that has any commercial value. About the
only thing not i-ecoverable is the paint.
* * # *
“‘Centurion”: The Australian, often con-
tent to let other people do and make things for
him that he can do and make much better
himself, is nevertheless the most resourceful
of blokes or coves. The rice-planters on the
Murrumbidgee irrigation area have struck
a specially wet season. Wet doesn’t affect
the crop, but it has made the harvesting a
problem. The difficulty has been overcome
by dispensing with the horses and tacking
on a small internal combustion engine to
supply the power. Cutting has been done
successfully in several inches of water and
the dodge is being tried on strippers. Inci-
dentally. the rice is larger in grain than any
imported, and of very fine quality.
* * * *
“Cartot”: Although the Sydney postal
authorities neglect few opportunities of
begging the public to address its cor-
respondence, whenever possible, to post-
office boxes, an application for a box
at the G.P.O. is invariably met with
the information that the applicant must
put his name down on the waiting-list.
In any case, he will be lucky if he gets a
box in six months, when one is given up by
somebody else. Practically no provision has
been made to meet the enormous increase in
the demand for these facilities. If every
city firm or business house desiring a box
could obtain one immediately, a tremendous
saving, both in time and money, could be
effected in the handling of the mails.

“Jcobb” : The motor-car, truck and lorry
have arrived in the Northern Territory, with
the result that trips which once took weeks
are now being done in days, mostly with the
lighter class of vehicle. Freight charges have
come down with a run, and with the early
establishment of a bulk-fuel supply in
Darwin further reductions are expected. The
fly in the ointment is the excessive charge
for transporting the vehicles from southern
distributing centres. To land a Ford truck
from Brisbane freight and other charges
amount to £42, with proportional increases
for the larger vehicle. This plus the same
heavy charges on tyres and other renewals is
a load that should be reduced in justice to
the small holder and settler in the Terri-
tory. The Westralian State steamship ser-
vice does things much more reasonably.
* * * *
"Borom" : The system of paying bonuses
for pests is one that needs overhauling,
especially in N. S. Wales. Payment for
scalps is now left to the local bodies and
there is not a standard rate for the whole
State. The bonuses vary widely. The re-
sult is that those who have scalps take
them to where the highest rate is offering,
and one shire may thus find itself buying not
only its own share but that of a neighbor-
ing shire whose rates are lower. There
have even been cases of landowners failing
to destroy pests or to check breeding in antici-
pation of a bigger rate elsewhere at a later
date. Another outcome is that no shire
wants to be the first to offer a bonus in the
event of a sudden increase in some pest, as
scalps from miles around will be brought to
it, whilst other shires delay offering, the
bonus themselves.


The Great Pine-Air Cure for
Coughs, colds
& BRONCHITIS
There is no better medicine for Throat, Chest and Lungs than
the rich balsamic air of the pine forests. Through the skill of the
pharmaceutical chemist the potent healing virtue of this balsamic
pine-air is now captured and condensed along with
other volatile medicaments into those wonderful
breathable tablets known as Peps.
To take the Peps treatment you simply peel off the
silver wrapper and allow the tablet to slowly dissolve
in the mouth. The powerful chest-strengthening
medicine liberated in the form of fumes is breathed
deeply and naturally straight into the lungs quite
contrary to the effect of drug-laden mixtures and liquid "cough-cures'
which can only act through the blood. As the Peps medicine passes through
the throat and air-tubes it finds out and exterminates dangerous germs:
removes soreness and weakness of chest, strengthens and heals tender,
inflamed bronchial tubes, and quickly cures the worst cough, cold 01-
chest trouble.

chitis, cold on the chest, early-morning cough,
malarial colds, laryngitis and innumerable other
throat, chest and lung dangers threatening young
and old in our trying climate.
Peps are never sold loose,
but in handv-size boxes at 1/6

everywhere. Every tablet
stamped with the name-*—
“Peps.” Beware of worthless
substitutes or cheap lozenges,

THE OLDEST JEWELLERY HOUSE IN SYDNEY.
TD
25&Z5 Hunter Street Sydney
“J.c.” : A Perth dentist tells me that most
of the humor he meets in his calling comes
from tlie cockies. One, he said, after being
fitted for a plate, begged him “to make era
pretty solid, Doctor —a man might get
kicked in the face by a ’orse any day!”
“Quiz” : Coated with rust inches deep, the
hull of the old turret ironclad Cerberus will
find a last resting-place on the back beach
at Williamstown (Vic.) as a breakwater for
sheltering fishing craft. A man who was
present at her official trials before she left
England in 1870, and who afterwards served
on her as a seaman, is living within half a
mile of the piet beside which she now lies.
“Sierra”: Two old pubs in Castlereagh-
street, Sydney, have dropped their homely
names and adopted titles more in keeping
with the dignity of the city that houses the
Millions Club. The Yorkshire Stingo lias be-
come the City Railway Hotel, and the Barley
Mow stares coldly through its many glitter-
ing windows as the Hotel V indsor. The
striking novelty of the new names may help
to refute the recent charge of a Yankee scribe
that Australians have no originality.
“C.S.”: An interesting point was raised
the other day when an individual was
charged with taking certain jewellery from a
Melbourne hotel, which was theft, and with
afterwards breaking out of the premises,
which made it burglary. There was no
evidence that he broke iu, for someone ap-
parently left a window open: but the dam-
aged state of a door showed that in his haste
he made a violent exit, and the law' doesn’t
mind whether it has him coming or going.
Dr. Vera Scantlebur.v is to be Director of
Vic. baby-welfare centres. She is an M.D.
of Melbourne, and the daughter of a me'd.
For nearly six months she and Dr. Henri-
ette Main conducted an inquiry in Maori-
land and Vic. regarding infant care, and the
joint report, comprehensive and common-
sense in tone and suggestion, will be a sort
of text-book for years. Dr. Scantlebury
cannot be accused of engineering a billet for
herself, as Dr. Argyle, Minister for Health,
announced before the investigation that he
intended to appoint a director.
“Clerk” : Following on the official christen-
ing of the “Geelong Flier,” Railway Com-
missioner Clapp has now started in earnest
to label his more important passenger trains.
The 5 p.m. Sydney express becomes the “Syd-
ney Limited,” and the 4.80 p.m. Adelaide “The
Overland.” The imposing title “Great
Northern Limited” has been bestowed on
the early-morning train to Bendigo, and
the comparatively nondescript "Bendigo Ex-
press” on the. afternoon vehicle. Clapp’s idea
is that a name gives a train a personality,
appeals to the public imagination, and fos-
ters a spirit of pride amongst railwaymen
in the performances of the train.
“Der Jong” : The cabled description of the
line-up for the rush to the new diamond
field at Elandsplat. in the Transvaal, makes
quaint reading. Some 15,000 people toed
the mark to race in and peg out when the
official “go” was given, and all sorts of pre-
parations were made for the sprint, includ-
ing the donning of spiked shoes and running
shorts by the more thorough-going. The new
field is in the n.-w. Transvaal, between the
wnstern end of the Witwatersrand and
Lichtenburg. It is open veldt country, not
well watered, and was well trekked over by
Australian regiments in the Boer War. Like
other finds of the sort, it will become a De
Beer’s “interest” if it turns out any good.
The Vic. Ministry has wakened to the
fact that the living conditions _of its em-
ployees at Yallourn, described in a recent
Bulletin, are a disgrace. Attorney-General
Eggleston told a deputation that plans bad
been prepared for remodelling the “Hill
camp,” wiping out the deplorable barracks
■ and putting in new dwellings. Btreets are
to be regraded to permit of household drain-
age being carried off, and drying and chang-
ing rooms provided for workers, who hitherto
have had to live in a state of perpetual damp-
ness. Electric current is to be provided. Jt
is a comic commentary on the business that
a concern which supplies electric light to
a million people scores of miles away didn't
think first of supplying the commodity to its
servants on the spot.
“T. 0.1.” : A mild argument is being waged
in the S. M. Herald about the naming of
Mount Victoria. One writer says that Gov-
ernor Macquarie, on his first trip across
the Blue Mountains, named it Mount Vit-
toria. But AntilFs journal records that the
Governor named it Cox’s Pass, in honor of
the man who superintended the making of the
primitive road. Another controversialist has
it that Major Mitchell, Surveyor-General,
named the hill Victoria, after the youthful
British princess and queen-to-be. As a
matter of fact, the surveyor of the Moun-
tains, William Romaine Govett, after whom
the Leap is named, conferred the name Vit-
toria in compliment to his chief, Major
Mitchell, who was in the storming of Vit-
toria. Govett wrote 20 articles on his sur-
vey, which he published on his return to Eng-
land, 1833-34, and in the opening article he
names the summit Vittoria.
“Dick H.”: Was the first ship built in
Australasian waters constructed in Australia
or in Maoriland '! The Francis, 41 tons, was
certainly completed in Sydney in 1792, but
she had been brought from England in frame,
to be completed of Australian timber. This
little ship was sent to Dusky Bay (M.L.) to
investigate “possibilities of trade” with N.
S. Wales. Ten months previously Raven,
who was in command, had visited the sound,
and left there a sealing party. “What ex-
cited my admiration,” lie says in his journal,
“w-as the progress they had made in construc-
ting a vessel of 40ft. in length.” When the
Francis sailed for Norfolk Island the un-
finished craft was abandoned. Later, in
October, 1795, the East Indiaman En-
deavour put into Dusky Bay in a sinking
condition. The sealers’ first experiment in
shipbuilding was found to be in a bad state
and the gear was removed, but a 70-ton ship,
still on the stocks, offered possibilities; she
was repaired, launched, rigged as a schooner,
put into commission to carry 90 persons, and
named the Providence. She sailed for Nor-
folk Island on January 7, 1790. The tim-
bers of the Endeavour still lie in Dusky
Sound, an object of interest to the tourist,
hundreds of whom treasure a block of her
teak, under the delusion that it is a souvenir
of Captain Cook’s famous vessel.

The Fruit of Day.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IVy IGIIT is the fruit of clay—a shining
fruit
* Or a dark apple of the moonless
hours
Sprung from the mists of earth, a tree whose
root,
Packed with the perfumes of a million
flowers,
Drinks at the well-spring of our secret
thought
Till sap and stem the final aim have wrought.
Where the l blue bough of Heaven earthward
dips
Dawn was the rosy pricking of the bud.
The paling stars were saved for silver pips ;
But when the warm noon came to mellow
flood
It shaped the petals of the finished flower
Till thrifty twilight, in her moth-grey bower,
Moulds with mysterious fingers night’s full
globe
Of blossom-trembling hedges by the rill.
There unseen hands have caught the stealthy
robe
That rustles, to hushed laughters, up the
hill—-
Fate, plucking from Life’s tree a varied loot,
Will drop into our laps our cherished fruit!
-V child at play beside the long lagoon
Finds night come down a sun-kist apricot,
(irass-yellow as a lifting harvest moon,
All firm and wholesome flesh, no creeping
rot
Making the roughened stone a tomb to hide
The myriad writhing worms that lurk inside.
To one shall come the Apple of Desire,
Red-stained upon the ambers of its globe,
Keeping within its core a smouldering fire
To scorch the snout that nuzzles Circe’s
robe.
A fatal circle is its thin-sliced rind
Where the dark seeds of lusts their fruits
shall find.
To one may fall an orange of the south,
Glistening mosaics packed within its
sphere,
The scarlet passion of a yielding mouth
Or quivering rainbows fashioned on a tear
Because he cannot hope to build again
The castle towers that seemed so true —-in
Spain !
A purple plum night flings the sailor man.
It cast white petals once in Tpkio—
Emblem of purity in Old Japan—
And wanderers reap the seed that others
sow.
Too ripe for him to-day the earth-fruits come.
Dreaming across the memory of a plum!
The scientist, as sere as dust by day,
One might suspect of desiccated fruits,
But he is luring back an English May,
A stretch of dappled grass and primrose
roots.
Night brings no husks to him who grasps at
truth;
Ilis threaded cherries have the taste of
youth!
Night is the fruit of day. So empty are
The days of some, night brings them only
sleep—
TJntrimmed the lamp that might have been
a star,
Unborn the fruits and buried dry and deep
The shoot of promise ; or they wake alone
To barren acres where no seed Was sown.
I often wonder what night brings to you
i With your still pools of thought where
lilies gleam.
Even at dawn your scattered blossoms blew
Your bannered boughs on every wild wind
stream.
Surely you pluck from day’s prolific trees
The golden apples of ITesperides!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
The Battle of the North.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Minister for Defence hastily left
his office in Sydney. There was an
unusual flush on his naturally pale
cheeks; and his steps, as he crossed Pitt-
street, seemed hesitating and uncertain. The
events of the last twelve hours might have
shaken stronger nerves than his. After the
strain of distant war, in which his energies
had been taxed to the utmost in raising con-
tingents and sending them to the front, he
had expected a period of calm. The British
authorities had been convinced of the safety
of Australia from attack; and the ships of
the fleet were, with a single exception, in the
Atlantic or the North Sea. Now, with an
almost stunning suddenness, had come the
news of an enemy landing in force at the
head of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The Wel-
lesley Islands had been secretly used for
months as a base; and already 70,000 men
had been landed east of Normanton.
Owing to the strict press censorship, the
newspapers had not yet published the facts,
but there were disquieting rumors afloat. It
was quite clear that full information must be
given to-morrow; and in the meantime every
possible step had been taken to divert troop's
intended for Europe towards the northern
point of danger.
It was just when the certainty that the
lanffing had actually taken place had pro-
duced in the Minister for Defence a feeling
akin to despair that .Tack Holt's note had
arrived. Jack was Professor of Tropical
Diseases'as well as a distinguished physicist,
but. his message seemed a little too definite
and assured not to suggest a touch of in-
sanity.
“Stop further enlistments,” it ran. “I have
a means of destroying any enemy, near or
at a distance. See me at my laboratory at
8.30 p.m.”
The Minister knew Professor Holt well,
had known him, in fact, from schoolboy days.
He could not believe that succor so strong
and ready wms at hand, but whatever it was
that Jack had to tell him he must discuss it.
“Looks as if the old cliap has gone mad,
he said as he crossed Martin-place, “but Ive
enough to make me mad also. It doesn t
follow that two madnesses make sanity. Still,
we’ll see.”
Holding this partially open mind, the
Minister reached the place where Holt con-
ducted his researches. He entered the small
private office and sank into a comfortable
chair.
“Well, now, what's it all about. Jack:
.“I want you to commandeer the w T hole
electric plant of the city—railways, tram-
ways, light—everything w T e can lay our
hands on.” .
“The deuce you do! Any other little
thing?”
The Professor smiled.
“It’s the biggest thing yet; but I’ll pull
it off.”
“Now, .Tack, suppose you start at the _ be-
ginning and tell me what it's all about.”
The Professor ran his fingers through his
voluminous hail'.
“That’s impossible. I could never make
you understand the details. Am I correct
in saying that a big enemy landing has taken
place in the north?
The Minister nodded.
“I don't know liow T you knew, but the
information is only too damnably correct.
“Right-oh! That little affair need not
last more than a day or two.”
“Hold on,” said the Minister. “If you
can’t explain w r hat you mean, at least give
me a rough outline of the insanity. Remem-
ber that I have no time to waste.” _
The Professor fell into the opposite chair,
lit a cigarette and began.
“You know I *have been studying the ways
of tropical insects and at the same time fol-
lowing some modern experiments with regard
to light and electric force.”
The Minister nodded.
“Very well, then. It will be less surpris-
ing that I have discovered that the vast
mosquito-swarms—many of them disease-
carriers—which breed in our tropical swamps
ar.e under electric control. I found that out
in Papua, where I noticed a distinct connec-
tion between the daily thunderstorms in cer-
tain districts and the mosquito flight. I can
now say definitely that I have such flights
under wireless control.”
“But w T hat the deuce—Oh, I see! Sool
the mosquito on to the enemy! Look, Jack,
I think I’m*wasting my time.”
“Sit still. I am going to show you. Throw
this affair over you, and see that it covers
your hands as well as your face.”
He completely enveloped the Minister in
a close net, drooping from a kind of wire
cap which held the fabric away from the
flesh. Arming himself in a similar manner,
he approached a small instrument in the
corner of the office.
“Now,” he said, “I am going to call up
the mosquito army from the swamps near
Botany Bay and from all the intermediate
districts. Keep cool. The results will prob-
ably startle you. You notice that all the
windows of the laboratory are open as well
as the one in this room.”
“Go ahead,” said the Minister, “but hurry
up the experiment.” ,
There was a low buzzing sound and a crackle
of sparks from the instrument; then the mos-
quito army began to arrive. The sharp,
long-drawn-out ping of individual insects
gave place to a dull drone. This in turn
changed to a pulsing roar, and the room was
full of wings. The dark suspended cloud in-
creased in darkness; the weight of the fly-
ing things became palpable.
The Minister rose with a hoarse shout,
beating the air with his hands.
“Here, Jack, I'm smothering. Call off
these devils of yours.”
Slowly the weight lifted; the cloud of
venomous insects dispersed and left the air
clear.
“Oh, my hands ! This is maddening. I’ve
got a thousand bites on every finger.”
“I told you to keep your hands well
covered,” said the Professor quietly. “Here !
Plunge your fists into this basin.”
The Minister’s * face gradually lost * its
look of agony.
“That’s grateful, and comforting.” he said.
It takes the sting away by magic. Can you
let that horror loose on the enemy?”
“ Yes, if I can connect with sufficient elec-
tric power.”
“You’ll have all the power I can com-
mandeer ; but tell me a little more about it.”
“Well, you’ve had a practical demonstra-
tion of what can be done in one district
alone. I estimate that there are on average
about twenty-five tons of mild mosquito in
and about Sydney. In the northern tropical
areas the quantity varies from a few pounds
to several hundredweights per acre real
vicious birds, mind you, not gentle little
things like those you’ve seen. Now, I ask
you. how long will any invading army endure
a concerted attack?”
The Minister threw down the towel with
which he had wiped his hands.
“Carry on. Jack,” he said. “Sane or in-
sane, I’m with you to the last sting.”
* *- * »
The Red army .of occupation under General
Kopoutsky had established itself without
opposition in a narrow tract of compara-
tively open country, flanked by dense forest
and guarded by two considerable water-
courses. General Quagmire, the second in
command, had undertaken extensive, work of
a non-military character; and everywhere
was to be seen a curious mixture of warlike
preparation and peaceful enterprise. The
red flag was much in evidence, and clearing
operations on a large scale were in progress ;
but practicable and evil-looking batteries had
been planted in strong positions, trenches
defended all likely points of attack, and every
effort had been made to render the whole
occupied area impregnable. The special busi-
ness of Quagmire—who was reputed to he a
German scientist of some standing wearing
an assumed name—was to produce with the
greatest possible speed food reserves which
would render the army of occupation inde-
pendent of outside supplies.
The object of the great Asian Soviet was
to place a quarter of a million communists
on Australian soil, to cultivate land, estab-
lish industries and, when the European war
ended in the expected stalemate, to maintain
the right to possession of a slice of territory
on the ground of effective occupation. It
was not expected that any Australian force
would be able to make a serious attempt to
dislodge the invaders; but some desperate

cloud darkened the east. The next moment
General Kopoutsky clapped his hand to his
eyelid. A large grey mosquito, leader of
that army of the night, died for Australia
in the forefront of the battle.
Then the attack developed in all its fury.
Wild clamor of voices gave place to screams
of agony. A thousand stabs to every square
inch of exposed man was the prelude to
that smothering and terrible wrestle with
the winged death. A huge Pathan, crushing
hundredweights of quivering fury, raised him-
self for a moment on a hilltop, but fell head-
long into the cushions of restless wings.
Everywhere the victory was complete. In
less than an hour every human movement
had ceased; and the black clouds above the
battlefield were gently breaking in the silvery
moonlight.
At half-past ten Sydney, which had been
silent and dark since the failure of the elec-
tric power, suddenly awoke to new life.
People stood about in groups and asked vvlial
it meant: but none guessed that the weary
battlers for Australia were winging their
flight back to their native swamps and gul-
lies. some hungry and angry still, some
gorged to repletion with the blood of the foe.
“What happened to Sennacherib’s army at
Jerusalem V" said Professor Holt the next
day. when the northern wireless had told its
amazing tale of the destruction of the foe.
“I wonder," the Minister for Defence re-
plied. "is it real or did we dream it; all?"
“General Kopoutsky knew.” said the Pro-
fessor. “Now the question is whether we
can find enough power to help matters on
in Europe."
“You don't mean to say we could send a
mosquito army from Australia to sting in
Europe?”
“I'm not sure. In any case it wouldn't
be fair to send our good defenders on such
a journey; but Southern Europe has supplies
of strong malarial stock that we could order
if we were sure of enough power."
As he spoke a secretary approached the
Minister with a cable.
“It’s all right. .Tack." he said when be
had read the message. “You can leash up
your hounds of war for another occasion.
This is Armistice Day. Moscow has thrown
in.the towel !"
And a sudden beating of kerosene-tins in
the street without proclaimed that an empire

Back from the Grave.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OTTR route wriggled perilously through
abandoned gold diggings where the
road had degenerated into mere hush
tracks; yet my responsibilities as chauffeur
were not ousting spectres of the past that
stalked through my brain. My passengers
were the Premier of the State and the
society beauty who had bewitched him when.
Australia at large was lauding a very prince
of strategists—when, indeed, a wedding-ring
was her passport to a title. Now, her Lady-
ship was obviously anxious about the re-
ception which would be afforded by the con-
stituents whom Sir Richard was journeying
to address.
We had just passed a weather-beaten ruin
which seemed to be mourning for the spark-
ling days when the Premier had used the
head of a beer-barrel as a stepping-stone
towards leadership. Memories were vision-
ing to me the place as it was of old. More-
over, I knew instinctively that the boss’s
mind was back in the past with those same
scenes, and that his memory was paying
homage to the same dead woman.
A few stark posts and tumbling slabs
now marked the spot where that jewel of
womankind had stood beside the beer-barrel
to encourage her husband in his first bid for
Parliamentary honors. My eyes still saw the
glory of her countenance when the storm of
approval—“Go it, Dick! Well done, Stone-
wall !"—-proclaimed that, at last, the diggers
had discovered among themselves the cham-
pion for whom they so long had sighed.
The grand dame who now sat beside the
boss was as unlike her predecessor as the
immaculate Minister was unlike Stonewall
Dick in his mud-caked moleskins. Iler Lady-
ship had sought a statesman wearing a halo
of renown : the other woman had been wooed
by a rollicking, squandering digger, but had
steadied him, and then quietly lured ami
pushed him upwards to the political zenith.
Then, having seen her victory, she died hap-
pily in his arms.
As we approached the site of Stone-
wall’s old humpy, some unaccountable
impulse caused me to slow down to
a standstill on nearing • a clump of
saplings. Thence we could discern some
bleached poles which even yet precari-
ously restrained a few sheets of bark from
sprawling to the grass. As if the halt were
an objective of our programme, the Minister
descended, and without a word brushed
through the leafage out of my sight.
A while later her Ladyship fretted: “Sir
Richard will miss the meeting. Go and
see if he requires assistance.”
Grudgingly I obeyed, and almost as I
had expected found Sir Richard spreading
fingers to a blaze of sticks sheltered by such
of the adobe fireplace as rains had not yet
demolished.
My lips moved, but a flicker in the eyes
of the boss bade silence. Although lie was
looking straight at me I knew that he was
not seeing me. At once I realised that
again he was at the hearth of the old bark
hut, communing with the wife whose worship
and optimism had lifted him from the handle
of a windlass to the helm of the State.
Feeling myself upon holy ground, I retreated
toward the car. There I glibly lied: "He
is composing his speech.”
When the boss returned to her Ladyship
I let the car out. Yet. concentrated as were
my faculties upon the road, my ears were
open to catch his voice. But he did not
speak. He had still* thought for his com-
panion, the noble woman whose presence
had sanctified that mud-built fireplace.
Oppressive silence was upon the three of
us until we sighted a gathering which to
all appearances was more than ready to
turn and smash a former idol.
I managed to steal an apprehensive glance
at the bereaved lover of half an hour agone.
Assuredly I had wasted my concern. It was
not the Honorable Sir Richard who lolled
upon the cushions: it was Stonewall Dick,
who had somehow shed his stained digger’s
shirt and pants for the perfections of sar-
torial art.
After hurriedly parking the car I ran
to catch every word of the speech. It
was well worth the hurry. I had listened
to him in the most lustrous hours of his
ascendancy, but never before had my heart
so responded ; never before had I known an
audience so swept off its feet by impassioned
fervor. Meanwhile my mental sight was
pee ring at the woman who once stood beside
the beer-barrel. She was still at the orator’s
elbow, occasionally whispering a word; and
her roaming eyes danced with .joy at every
sign of approval amongst the audience.
Suddenly I was starting aghast at the
platform. Stonewall Dick was suddenly
transformed into a scared alien who stut-
tered. bewildered, having lost the thread of
his talk. His eyes ranged round apprehen-
sively. There struck in upon me a shivering
dread that all was lost. In the excitement
of the moment there burst from my throat
a roar: “Go it. Dick! Well. done. Stone-
wall !’’
So instantaneously that I question if half
a dozen of the audience had noticed the fal-
tering. the old-time digger was himself again.
Once more the persuasive rhetoric of a man
sympathetic with toilers, a toiler himself,
juggled with men’s emotion as if Stone-
wall were pulling the strings of dancing-
dolls. After his fervid peroration, a fren-
zied crowd mounted the benches, and waved
hats to the deafening applause which quickly
flowed into ringing chorus : “F.or He’s a Jolly
Good Fellow.”
The soul of a dead heroine had remained
Dick’s guiding star, and the wreck of a mud
fireplace had been an altar.

I love the taste of old and mellow wine.
Rich with the sunshine of Provencal days;
I love dim halls where flickering candles
shine
And throw their shadows in a thousand
ways.
1 love old towns and walls of storeyed stone —-
Brave ramparts of a world long passed
away.
I love a road that winds to the Unknown
And poets who can sing of Yesterday!

“ATCO”
ALL-BRITISH PETROL MOTOR-MOWER.
Atccr
The “ATOO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the necessity
of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, etc.
It is fitted with a 2f-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “ATCO„” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
Sold in two sizes—l6-inch cutters, £7l; 22-inch cutters, £lO5 complete.
Printed matter supplied, with pleasure on application.
