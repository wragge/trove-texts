The Australian Play
Australia is perhaps the only country in
the world that has no drama. In every
other form of art something has been
achieved. Conder and Bunny have pictures
in the Luxembourg, Lawson has been trans-
lated into French as a classic ; but in drama
we are as we were at the beginning.
Drama is the most popular of the arts,
and Australians are a theatre-going people.
But Australia has not yet taken the theatre
seriously. At the time of writing all Mel-
bourne flocks to see two melodramas, a
comic opera, a farce, and a variety show. On
an average, about three interesting plays are
produced in a year. No city in the world of
the same size is so easily pleased, no city—
except Sydney. It is a debatable point
whether the managers are to blame for the
bad taste of the public, or the public to
blame for the bad taste of the managers.
One thing is certain; bad taste dominates
the theatre.
Eleonora Duse, the greatest of all actresses,
has said : “To save the theatre, the theatre
must be destroyed, the actors and actresses
must all die of the plague. They poison the
air ; they make art impossible. It is not
drama that they play, but pieces for the
theatre. We should return to the Greeks,
play in the open air ; the drama dies of stalls
and boxes and evening dress, and people
who come to digest their dinner.”
The Australian play has not yet been
written or at least produced, and until it
stands the test of production it has no real
existence. A play upon paper, says Goethe,
is nought. Though no notable play has yet
been produced, we know that certain writers
have displayed sufficient dramatic capacity
to earn a hearing. Bedford, for example,
put good material into a melodrama, and
BILL MOORE.
spoilt the melo-
drama. Given an
opportunity, I feel
sure he could write
a play that would
be as good as ‘ ‘ The
Squaw Man ” or
“ In Mizzouri.”
Bert Bailey and
Edmund Duggan,
by making a popu-
lar success of their
local melodrama,
“ The Squatter’s
Daughter,” proved
that the public had
no a, priori objec-
tion to Australian
work. (The pub-
lic has no objec-
tion to anything,
the public is ever
patient.) And if
an Australian
melodrama can
Succeed, there is
nothing to pre-
vent the success
of an Australian
farce or an Aus-
tralian tragedy.
Certain experiments have been made that
show what way the wind is blowing. In
Adelaide Mr. Treharne has founded an ad-
mirable institution which gives nine per-
formances a year of modern European
masterpieces. It is doubtful if any theatre
in London has a more interesting repertoire.
Mr. Treharne has produced Shaw; Gals-
worthy, Barker, Masefield, Yeats, Synge,
Lady Gregory, Maeterlinck, a number of
German, French and Scandinavian plays,
and two Australian plays by Arthur Adams,
Interest in serious drama is keener in Ade-
laide than elsewhere, and Mr. Treharne’s
society should form a model for societies in
the other Australian cities. In Sydney, the
Stage Society, a more aristocratic body, has
produced other plays by Arthur Adams ; but
I am not acquainted with its aims or prin-
ciples.
In Melbourne we have done very little.
For some years we have talked volubly, read
plays, started societies that came to nothing,
and wasted energy in futile criticism instead
of making an effort to write or produce plays.
Melbourne is cursed by the academic spirit.
Our leading literary authorities are mostly
people who have never written anything.
Our earnest students of the drama have
seldom been in a theatre. Our critics have
culture without energy, and their thoughts
are sterile. They have no interest in build-
ing up a national drama, or anything else
that is new, and doubtless deprecate any
such ambition as provincial.
William Moore was the first to experiment
with the local play. Last year he was his
own entrepreneur, author, leading actor and;
stage manager, and attracted a crowd before
which any writer might be proud to present
his work. On October 5, this year of grace,
he repeated the experiment. Three short
plays were given, for one of which I was
responsible ; the rest is a matter of history.*
Two points seem to me worth noting : the
audience is tolerant, perhaps too tolerant;
and the acting is decidedly good. On the
whole, I think the acting, by amateurs too,
was better than the plays. At any rate, any
failure was due not to the acting or the audi-
ence, but solely to the writer. When the
real play comes to be written there is little
danger of it being spoilt, by a bad inter-
pretation. Moore had the courage to blaze
the track, and in the future something should
be achieved in drama.
Personally, I can see little prospect for
any play, far less for the foundation of a
national drama, that is not modern. His-
torical convention and cloak-and-dagger
romance will lead us nowhere. A dramatist
must know intimately the characters and
situations he writes about.. Drama cannot
be made at second hand. It has always been
closely associated with the life of the people.
And, as Havelock Ellis observed, it is only
by being national that one becomes inter-
national. '
We want a ' good bush play, something
large and primitive—a play that will be as
vital and original as a ballad by Brady or a
story by Lawson. W e have the audience ;
we have the actors. We have the raw
material, man and nature. All we lack is
the play.
LOUIS ESSON.
Moore’s Drama Night No. 2.
Oh Wednesday, October 5, there occurred
at the Turn Yerein Hall, Melbourne, the
second of Mr. William Moore’s drama nights.
The place was crowded to the doors with a
brilliant horde, which mostly paid. The
night was eminently enjoyable—everything
was interesting in its way, though the coffee
was a trifle cold—but let that pass.
Miss Pritchard’s play was hardly a brilliant
success because the handsome burglar seemed
rather sparing of his melodious voice, yet the
play had an idea in it; but the man next to
me would not keep his feet still—so I missed
it. William’s “ Tea Room Girl ” was clever
on rather usual lines, and the author misap-
plied the art of the dramatist when he manu-
factured the slang term of “ Domer ” (a
suburban who meets his girl under dome,
Central Station), but the gentleman who
undertook the part of the “ Homer ” was the
brilliant spot in the Moore department. At
the end of his performance Mr. Moore was
presented with his head, done in marble by
Mr. Web Gilbert. It looked very nice, but
seemed to be supported on a rather thin
stick.
The thing that jumped up and com-
pelled attention irom the scoffer, and will
hang in memory as a truly perfect work
both in its literary finish and in the per-
formances of the players, was Louis Esson’s
“ Woman - Tamer.”
Every word bit. It
was written to bite
and acted to bite.
Esson deserves all
credit for his por-
tion, but surely the
cast must have fallen
from Heaven into
his fervent lap. The
thing was tight,
well in hand, and
yet full of a sort
of artistic richness
and exuberance—a
perfectly finished
work of art. The
slum characters were
the real thing, in-
tensified for the
dramatic require-
ment. They stood
confidently on the
thin'ridge of natural-
ness that divides ex-
LOUIS ESSON.
travagant caricature from mere dulness.
The scheme of the play is slight enough.
Katie (Miss Maisie Maxwell) has become
tired of her fat gentleman friend, bight
Chopsey, who sings outside pubs. Chopsey
is full of good intentions, but sutlers from a
tired feeling. Katie dismisses Chopsey, and
he is replaced by a gentleman with the de-
licious name of Bongo, who “ is coinin’ out
to-day.”
Apart from its powerful use of an ex-
pressive and dangerous vernacular, the play
has a climax that seems like a stroke of
genius. Bongo arrives while poor Chopsey
is being slabbed over with the muddiest of
mud. He attempts to assist Katie in the
ejection of his undesirable precursor by
gently (very gently, mind you, for an audi-
ence would ruin the whole thing by laughing
if Bongo showed boisterous tight) shaping up
to the crushed pubsinger: but Katie toils
him not to dirty his ’ands on Chopsey, who
climbs to his exit in great sorrow. Then
Katie gets metaphorically all over Bongo
with heY caressing voice and manner. She
helps him to “a bit o’ cray,” and says in a
hundred ways how fine it is to have him
back. All this time Bongo utters not one
solitary word, but attacks the beer put
before him and grins with genuine pleasure.
At last he grabs the girl, pulls her on to his
knee, and, as he holds the delighted woman
the curtain comes suddenly down on his
silence. The thing could not have been done
better, and was as fine a piece of dramatic
work as the present writer has ever kicked
his toe against.

William Moore’s Tea-Room Girl, the first
of a series of “Plays with Local Back-
ground,” is published by T. G. Lothian, of
Melb., at Is. It does not enter into the
select circle of plays which can be read as
well as acted.
Spain
The members of the Civil Guard commanded
his respect. - ,
I have met these men m all sorts of places and
never had cause to do less than admire them.
The only thing one might possibly object to is the
cut of their trousers; these are poems m wrinkles
and crinkles like concertina bellows, and every
cut is so much at random that they fit nowhere,
except where they are strapped in at the W!l ist.
The Guardia Civiles are said to be splendid
marksmen, but they sometimes miss the floor and
spit on one’s boots.
* ■* * *
After the quiet tone and appreciative
attitude of Luifman, Rafael Shaw s Spam
from, Within conies as a revelation of slum-
bering forces beneath the surface. Luftmann
looks upon the poverty of the Spaniards as
inevitable, and the prospect of reform from
within as exceedingly remote. Shaw, who
claims to have watched the people closely
for years, says that Spain is seething with
discontent.
Taxation is heavy, and acts as a bar to
enterprise. Every tradesman has to pay a
license fee. Even the account books used
in business are taxed. Emigration is steadily
increasing. The administration is corrupt,
and voting is only nominally free. The
patient submission of the peasantry is not
due to animal stupidity and indifference.
They refrain from open complaint because
they are afraid of . being - black-listed and
losing their work—afraid of starving. There
is little organisation amongst them, and they
are dreadfully ignorant.
Next to bread, the chief desire of the Spaniard
is education for his children. He is thoroughly
conscious of the disadvantages of his own ignor-
ance,, which he bitterly resents,-and the blame for
which he lays at the door of the Church.
The rich look after their own dependents,
but are. indifferent to thd general welfare of
the people. They do not, however, excite
the same animosity as the religious orders.
Shaw maintains that the Spanish working-
men are not anarchists nor atheists. They
are loyal to Alphonso, and appreciate a
settled dynasty. They are deeply religious;
but, rightly or wrongly, they are bitterly
hostile to the priesthood, and blame them
for their ignorance and present ills.
The larger part of Shaw’s book is devoted
to an indictment of the religious orders.
Since the rising in Cataluna last year, they
are afraid of the people ; but Shaw saw little
hope of reform in Spain until there is a com-
plete change. If this observer is to be be-
lieved, the social fabric is rotten at the top
and-badly needs repair. The recent disturb-
ance in Portugal may frighten the authorities
into making radical improvements, or may
encourage a similar explosion.
An essay by Maeterlinck on “ The In-
sects’ Homer ” appears in The Forum for
September. It is an account of the 50
years’ work of Fabre, an entomologist, who
observed many curious details in the lives of
beetles, scorpions, etc. The result of it
all was that Fabre became more profoundly
convinced than ever that the whole creatio i
is incomprehensible.
Scientifically, Nature is a riddle without a
definite solution to satisfy the curiosity of men.
Hypothesis is succeeded by hypothesis, the theo-
retical rubbish heaps up and the truth ever
escapes us.
'Maeterlinck’s business has been the darting
of chain-lightning into the incomprehensible.
His essays are fired with imagination which
illumines the blackness for a moment and
leaves it blacker than ever. Still, the dis-
play is delightful for its own sake, while it
lasts.
—: i
Randolph Bedford is preparing for a descent
upon Maoriland in the disguise of a lecturer.
One can imagine MiL. sitting up and asking what
struck it after Randolph the Reckless has passed
through. As an entertainer, he should prove to
be a whole circus and the dog under the waggon
in one suit of clothes. . . . Louis Beeke is in
Sydney writing his thirty-ninth novel, arid articles
for London papers. . . . E. J. Brady lias been
held up in Adelaide by rheumatism. The pain
has been moderated by the knowledge that no less
than three publishing firms are preparing to
spread the name of Brady over many waters.
Bushlrmd Ballads' is due shortly; River Rovers,
another book of verse and a story for boys are to
appear in 1911; and there are two other books
asking to be printed in London. . . , A daughter
of the veteran “Rolf Boldrewood” has had a
novel accepted in London.
The business-like ejectment of Manuel from
Portugal has turned the limelight on to Spain,
and one looks at the cables in the morning
paper prepared for any news from that quar-
ter. The average newspaper reader does not
bother about distant countries except on the
happening of earthquakes or other disturb-
ances there, and Spain dropped out of notice
after the war with America until the execu-
tion of Ferrer gave her a lift up last year.
It happens that there are two hooks handy
which give a good deal of information about
Spain, Of course, there are many others,
for Spain has provided material for some of
the best travel books in English, su'ch as
Richard Ford’s Handbook and George Bor-
row’s delightful account of his adventures as
agent for the Bible Society, both printed in
the middle of last century.
These can be read witli advantage for the
sake of their literary charm, and Havelock
Ellis’s The Soul of Spain , which appeared
two years ago, points out that Spam to-
day is much the same as in their time ; in
fact, the people have changed little since
the days of Cervantes. Their character
is fixed ; thehrpride and their stoicism, their
child-like vanity and impetuosity have not
altered, and the majority of the people are
as poor and lazy as when Dob Quixote set
forth, upon his memorable journey.
The two books referred to are the j ust-
published—Quiet Days in Spain, by C.
Bogue Luftmann (Murray), and Spain from
Within, by Rafael Shaw (Angus and
Robertson). They are entirely different in
aim and style. Both help to an understand-
ing of Spanish character and the present
position in Spain.
Luftmann, who spent some years in Aus-
tralia, is an incurable vagabond. “I used
to be impatient of the slow coach,” he says,
“now 1 am impatient of those who are
rushing to get ahead. . . . Nothing scares me
like the thought of having to do something
‘regularly.’ Ugh!” Spain is the ideal
country for such a man. He wandered from
place to place, travelling over more than
seven thousand miles of land, and taking
pot-luck with all sorts of people, and he
gives many glimpses of their every-day
life, their humor and boastfulness and their
poverty.
Poverty is the most painful and haunting fact
of Spain. Millions of tier people go .hungry
thoughout their lives. Gaudy pomp, religious
ceremony, debasing superstition, tiie brags of life
and hopeless, comfortless poverty are almost
everywhere jumbled.
The Spaniard is lazy, but not so blackly idle
as he has been painted. The trouble with
him is that he lacks initiative and admini-
strative ability. “He is the child of Europe,
an ignorant, but astute, greedy and incur-
ably vain child.”
His poverty has made him afraid, and a number
of traits, racial or acquired, leave him incapable
of looking on life.and its concerns from the stand-
point of other European peoples. Nevertheless,
he preserves a fine soul. The Spanish country-
man is a splendid fellow, as eager, industrious,
clean,-living,and contented as any man on earth
when he is given a chance to live decently.
Apparently lie does not got many such chances,
for most of the peasants to whom Luftinann
introduces us are tattered and dirty, their
homes hovels, and all are shockingly under-
fed. “ The most conspicuous want in Spain
is domestic comfort.”
One cheerful saying of Sancho Panza’s was
“There is still sun on the wall.” Sancho
still represents the southern Spaniard, in
whom there is a stronger infusion of Moorish
blood than in the Castilian or Aragonese' of
the. North. But all the peasantry are alike
in their fatalism* their ability to‘extract a
grain of comfort from the stoniest circum-
stances, and their love of the sun. Luft-
mann appreciates their chronic thieving of
time.
t grow to like the Spaniard for saying “To-
morrow will be soon enough. ’ To-day he would
live. Every day he “takes the sun.”
Language ijs not necessary to the Spaniard,
as both male, and female can communicate
most eloquently by gesture. When lan-
guage is required there is plenty of it, violent
in epithet and musical in sound. The boor-
ish peasant often has a ready wit:
He .never-states, the simple fact, since he is
always equal to a fine figure of speech. Even his
boasting is splendid. Always a simple soul, he
has high courage, and is, I verily believe, the
peasant gentleman of Europe.
You may follow Luftmann from one dis-
trict to another, watch the handling of mus-
catels at Cabello, the fair at Seville, a church
festival or a burial ; learn how the women
do their hair, what the cooking is like, and
much other interesting information without
being bored for a moment. Perhaps the
best part of his book is in the life-like
sketches of “characters” whom he met,
most of -them working men or woitien.

A Clergyman’s Testimony to Clements Tonic .
REV. R. HEFFERNAN, V.D.
The opinions of Ministers of the
Church must be treated with re-
spect. In this instance this testi-
mony is given as an act of charity
for the good that it may do the suf-
ferTng pub lie, by the Rev. Richard
Heffernan, V. D., of St. Paul’s
Rectory, Canterbury, one of the
best-known churchmen of N.S.
Wales, and for 20 years Chaplain
to the military forces. The poor
in health should read each word.
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“ St. Paul’s Rectory,
‘Canterbury, Sydney, 22/8/’ 10.
“ From the personal experience of those who have used
your tonic, and from my own experience of same, I can say
that it has very special qualifications as a nerve and brain
medicine for anyone requiring it, especially in cases of
Nervous Breakdown, Brain-fag or Insomnia. It is also
beneficial in creating a good appetite and aiding the digestive
organs. It seems to me what it is claimed to be, ‘ a nerve and
brain tonic,’ from the testimony of those who have used it.
“ Faithfully yours, RICHARD HEFFERNAN, V.D.”
♦
Those who suffer from Anaemia or Poor Blood, Lassitude or. Weakness, Poor Digestion
and Appetite, Biliousness, Sick Headache. Low Spirits, Broken Rest, or Bad Kidneys should
use it. They will find it pri ves renewed strength and health. It proves its worth by the tes-
timonies accorded it. ALL CHEMISTS AND STORES SELL IT EVERYWHERE.


A Tonic Free from
Alcohol
Are you pale, weak, easily tired,
and do you lack nerve power?
Ask your doctor if Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla would not be good for
you. He knows, and will ad-
vise you wisely. Not a drop of
alcohol in this medicine, ft
puts red corpuscles into the
blood, gives steady, even power
to the nerves; and all without
simulation. Make no mistake.
Take only those medicines the
best doctors endorse. Ask your
own doctor

Grown-up.
Farewell, Bohemian Sydney ! Thou
Whom privileged children—neglected now —
Played icith and loved in the dreamy days
Ere they grew tired of child-like ways . . .
Grown-up, thy part is a woman's part,
Giving to strangers proud lips, warm heart !
Sweet were the indolent years ! I ween
Lovelier maiden was never seen ;
Now is she flattered and famous, now
Hath she forgotten her girlhood’s vow.
Child-like and simple was she we knew,
Mother and sister and comrade too.
Prodigal always, of joy we sung,
Holiday-dreaming ; unwisely flung
Wisdom away—who would ever guess
Time, Master Tyrant, so fast could press?
While we were quaffing the loving-cup
Sydney, fair Sydney, was growing up.
Scarcely a fragment of youth remains . . .
Gone are old taverns, cobble-stones, lanes;
Gone, yet remembered as trusted friends
Stored with heart’s lumber of odds and ends.
Vain ’tis to seek them in broadways strange,
Branded with hall-marks of Time and Change.
Dead are the silences sylvan . . . fled
Bush-birds whose message of mercy led
Fugitive sorrow to grief’s surcease
Over the foothills of dream and peace,
Down to enchantment of harbor bays—
All now unveiled and well-beaten ways.
Faster, still faster the tall trees fall,
Trees that for ages held festival
When the gay summer-birds chanted there
Nesting, and wild-flowers ’censed the air—
Steadily on the grim builder goes.
Smiting old friends as they were new foes.
Picturesque, simple and beautiful,
Only waifs of the older school—
Foster-child truly as native-born—
We, with our passion for beauty, mourn
Vanished, familiar shapes and sounds ;
Change is a spirit of leaps and bounds.
Woman-like, she with a woman’s art
Luring the stranger to her warm heart,
And as old playthings old playmates mourn
Fashioned new gauds for her youngest born,
Strangers, the children that loved her meet
Features that mock them in every street!
Beautiful Sydney, thy day-dream past.
Clothed in fine raiment thou'rt queen at last.
Rival of Athens and Rome, maybe
Richer and wiser, yet strange to me —
Strange, for I loved thy simplicity best;
Strange, for thy glory is heart's unrest.

The Lost Back Yard.
The modern city child has lost his most precious birth-
right, the back yard. —American Paper.
Reeking court and alley, narrow city slum,
Life, beneath its burden, hopeless, crushed and
dumb,
Little children playing in the foetid yard
Never plucked a daisy from the grassy sward ;
That is how it once was, now the case is worse.
O’er that joyless playground spreads the brick-
built curse.
Loom, more room for business! Room for toil
and trade!
Places where the sunlight lingered, half afraid,
Yield to the grim darkness, pent and walled
about,
All the bricks of progress drive the children out,
Every gathered million in the city’s purse
Draws the city’s children deeper ’neath the curse.
Hearken, O Australia, e en such things are known
In your sun-warm cities, pent and overgrown.
Bricks are more than children, trade is more than
life,
Woes of older peoples in your streets are rife;
Stay the hand and ponder e’er the growing curse
To your narrow gateways draws the white man’s
hearse.
Narrow are your gateways, but the seas are wide ;
Many ports unpeopled front the ocean tide.
From the dwarfing bondage of your blindness
wake.
Use your larger sea-board for the children’s sake,
ror the white man’s honor that is yours to nurse
Burst the chains that bind you, spurn the city’s
curse !

Owed (and Paid) to a Bottle.
I’ve sung of the wattle
Since long, long ago ;
But an ode to the bottle
Is the ode that I owe—
An ode to the bottle.
And I ought to know.
I’ve carried it home
On nights dark and wild,
Well hugged to my bosom,
Like a mother her child.
I’ve fought for it raging
And fought for it mild.
I’ve stuck to it emptj%
When friends were in vain,
Till I had the trav bit
To fill it again.
And it stuck to me
Both in sunshine and rain.
I’ve sung of the wattle
Since long, long ago ;
But a song to the bottle
Is the song that I owe •
An ode to a bottle.
And I ought to know.

The best friend of the gas consumer
Maybe you are grudgingly paying every month a gas bill much
larger than it should be.
Maybe you have experimented with some “ cheap ” gas mantle, and
after a few hours discarded it with disgust.
Maybe you have complained of
the poorness of the light, despite the
heavy cost. The user of Welsbach
Mantles has none of these troubles.

In a Welsbach Mantle you have
a good friend. You can always
rely on it giving perfect 1 ght,
burning brilliantly for at least 1000
hours, and withstanding shocks and draughts which would at once cause the
downfall of the average mantle. It is the Welsbach- fluid with which the
mantle is treated that gives to it its phenomenal strength and illuminating power.
INSTALL WELSBACH MANTLES, and you soon notice a big
difference in your gas bill. With the reduction in cost of maintenance comes an improvement in light.
Ask your gasfitter or plumber for Welsbach Mantles.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tim Bulletin ivould oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad vertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for "copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to •persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

AN ENLARGED IMMIGRATION POLICY.
The fact that Labor is beginning to definitely
arrive, not only in Federal but in State politics,
must soon create a necessity for a more definite
immigration policy. Hitherto the party has not
been very well furnished in this respect—not nearly
so well furnished as its opponents. No one can
deny that the Fat party has been strong on im-
migration. Its idea has been to keep the big
estates locked up against settlement in the old,
old way ; to import plentifully, and to manufac-
ture as little as possible; to provide neither
factories for artisans nor land for small settlers;
and then to shovel new people into the country
In droves—helping to pay their passages,
if necessary, with loan money, and leaving the
bill to Posterity. On those principles Fat
reckoned that he saw a good time coming, when
the price of skilled labor would be 255. or 30s. a
week, and tbe hat-brim of unskilled labor would
be worn out, through the owner touching it as
he offered to work almost any hours for almost
anything. Naturally, all sane democrats objected
to this notable Vision of Fat. Their attitude was
that when sufficient land was made available for
our own settlers, and enough factory jobs had been
found for our own artisans, then they would
look kindly upon the idea of a systematic
immigration policy; but, until these things
happened, they preferred to remain in a
state of suspended animation. So far as the
supply of land for small settlers was concerned,
the Labor party, until quite recently, could do
little or nothing, for Fat was in power. And, as
regards the other half of the problem, a large sec-
tion of the Labor party, especially in N.S.W.,
has always been against finding work for either
the local or the imported artisan, and has clung
pathetically to the tail of the rich Tory importer
and the caudal appendage of the rich Tory im-
porting paper. So, one way and antoher, very
little systematic immigration work has been done
in recent years, and even that little has been none
too satisfactory.
■* * * *
Now the situation is changed. The Labor
party has got control of the tariff machinery, and,
if Australia isn’t presently clamoring for thousands
of new artisans, it and no one else will be re-
sponsible. In two States it is in possession of the
Lands Department and the Lands policy, and in
a Federal sense it has power to compel the break-
ing up of big holdings in all six States. Also, it
has the Northern Territory at its command.
Therefore, if there is not presently enough land
available for our own would-be small settlers and
a vast surplus for small settlers from oversea, the
Labor party will again be responsible. No man
can profess to believe that, when a whole continent,
and a fairly fertile one at that, has a population
of about three persons to two square miles, any-
thing but shameful mismanagement can prevent
there being room for immigrants—millions of im-
migrants. The gross incapacity of the aggregate
Tory, evidenced in his importing policy, his land-
monopoly policy, his rotten finance and his
borrowing madness, has often in past years made
Australia seem like a land which had already
more people than it could support; but that is not
evidence. Tory mismanagement is capable of
making a failure of everything—even of Paradise.
* * * *
The reasons why Australia urgently requires
desirable white immigrants are so obvious that it
seems almost superfluous to recapitulate them.
Provided there is plenty of work for him to do,
the new arrival who comes here with, say, a wife
and three children at once proceeds to shoulder
about £3OO of the lamentable public debt. It
only requires a sufficiency of him and his kind to
reduce the debt burden by half, or even more. He
also proceeds to help the revenue along, directly
and indirectly, to the extent of about £5O a year
(£lO per head) without any necessary correspond-
ing increase of expenditure ; for 10,000 people on a
given area don’t require 10 times as much govern-
ing as 1000 people do, and there is economy in num-
bers. The immigrant, if there is enough of him and
lie is the right kind, will turn hopelessly unpayable
railways into sources of revenue, will shove up the
value of Government land to the great profit of the
State, and, above all things, each one of him will
be an item in the great question of defence. It
may depend on him in the end whether this coun-
try is white or black, whether it is Christian or
Buddhist, whether it is Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-
Monkey, and whether the Parliamentary Labor
party is or is not hanged uncomfortably on a high
tree by scoffing Asiatics. Other things being
equal, the big battalions settle these matters, and
Australia may not have time to grow the requisite
battalions. A certain lamentable class of people
urges us to depend on British assistance in time of
trouble—the assistance which may or may not be
given ; in other words, on the importation at the
critical moment of British soldiers and sailors,
sent here by Bull as an act of charity, and pos-
sibly on financial aid lent by Bull as another act
of charity. But it is cheaper and more reliable to
import these same soldiers and sailors in peace
time, and then this country will have them for
certain without depending on anybody’s charity.
Also, they will be paying taxes here instead of in
the Bull country ; so Australia will have money
for defence without any need to appeal to the kind
consideration of Bull.
* * * *
The enlarged immigration movement should
be started early. It is a business that can’t be
rushed, for supply of desirable folk—not
Russian Jews, Sal’ Army fanatics, submerged
tenth, allegedly reformed criminals, semi-savages
from Southern Europe, and weird movable sects
like the Doukhobors or “the Holy Ghost and
Us”—isn’t si very great. And while a steady
stream of new settlers is easily absorbed, a vast
sudden rush of them may badly disorganise even
a very prosperous labor market. But, under
proper renditions, immigration should make
Australia very much richer, instead of poorer.
Except in a country which suffers badly from the
land monopoly disease and the importing and
Freetrade disease, or which is actually crowded
beyond its feeding capacity, the desirable immi-
grant pays his own way and something more. At
present there are supposed to be in the Common-
wealth about 4i millions of consumers to find em-
ployment for 4£ millions of producers and possible
producers. They manage to live in reasonable
comfort and to show a surplus, represented by the
savings of the people, despite the fact that when
million people have to pay the cost of govern-
ing a continent they have a heavy burden to carry.
If there were in Australia 14 or 40 million
consumers to find work for 14 or 40 million pos-
sible producers, the balance would be preserved
just as accurately as it is now; the country
wouldn’t, unless it was shamefully misman-
aged, have begun to experience the poverty
which arises through overcrowding; and the
surplus wealth should be greater, because the cost
per head of government would be less. In a
country which manufactures for itself under sane
conditions, and abjures the importing crank, and
swears off the land-monopoly curse, there is as
much room for 10 men as for one; and there is
more wealth per head for 10 men than for one.
And when 10 guns go off instead of one it is
much more discouraging to the invader. There-
fore, it will be well for Australia to make a
vigorous immigration policy part of its Labor
programme. If the rest of the programme.is
right, there will be room in this empty land, and
within 12 months from now, for the beginning of
a much larger influx of new settlers than Aus-
tralia has had for many years past. And if there
isn’t room, then the rest of the programme calls
for inspection and repair, especially in the direc-
tions of the progressive land-tax and the tariff
and the railway construction policy ; for the signs
will be that there are white ants in the posts
which prop up the Commonwealth.
THE STATE’S OLD MAN OF THE SEA.
From a man who has struggled with about the
biggest back-country enterprise in Australia :
The cause of the N.S.W. Labor victory is not far to
seek, if one has a knowledge of the State as a whole.
Like the fly on the wheel, Sydney considers itself the
main cause of prosperity in the State—next, of course,
to the Liberal Government. In a country like this, with
practically no decent rivers, and with no mountains
worth speaking of (and what there are of them
badly placed, from a geographical point of view), pros-
perity depends on a good rainfall. Given that rainfall,
which we have had for seven years, the worst of Govern-
ments could not stop the progress of the country. The
Liberal Government has claimed this prosperity. May
Heaven forgive it!
* * •* *
Instead of the increased credit balances of the years of
plenty having been returned to the country in the shape
of water conservation and new railways, to meet the de-
mand for them, the State has done practically nothing in
that way for nearly 20 years. The bulk of the spendable
income of the State has gone in increasing the luxuries
and comforts of the city residents, who are ever howling
for still more comforts. Cheap trams and many of them,
cheaper train fares and still cheaper, are, in the eyes of
the city residents, their right; the country resident
may go to the Devil, or far as tne city politician cares.
And the awfulness of it is, the Government has acted as
the city man thinks. There is no gainsaying it, Sydney
can and does get whatever it asks for. Wnereyer the
suburbanites are gathered together, there will the
electric trams be built that is, if the yells
of the residents resound in the ears of an M.P. The
country, on the other hand, is a series of small villages
in a large district, and it is, of course, impossible to build
a separate railway to each small centre. The smallness
of the voice of one settlement of 250 people does not
worry a member who has 60 such places in his elec-
torate. Each set of election speeches has, how-
ever, failed to convince some district of the
soundness of Liberal members’ arguments; and al-
though no organisation has been attempted by the
country as against the city, slowly but surely an uncon-
scious bond has been created among the residents of the
Outback. They have seen (Queensland, with two-fifths
the population of N.S.W., owning 50 per cent, more rail-
way mileage. They have listened for 20 years to large
promises of this and that quasi-Liberal Government, and
have seen no attempt made to fulfil the promises. Rail-
way proposals of national importance have been inquired
into, passed and dropped. Is it any wonder the country
electorates have been steadily voting in increasing num-
bers for a Labor Government which promises them some
relief from the present state of things?
* * * *
Each city idiot who calmly states that, were it not for
the suburban traffic, the railways would work at a loss,
only deepens the feeling of irritation. The city does not
realise that the only excuse for its existence is the
country, where the raw products come from. The manu-
factures of the State would not exist if they had to im-
port the raw material. Without the country there
would be no Suburbia, and if the traffic is a profitable
one, then it is due absolutely to the country which
called it into being. While the country was being
opened up, Sydney lived and mouldered on the
Government money spent in maintaining a convict
settlement. The tapping of the wealth of the land
first put the blood of healthy youth into the city ;
but of late years it has grown into a vampire that wants
all the blood of the State. That this unnatural of
affairs will demand a punishment is sure. The first
drought (and there is nothing more sure in the Australian
climate) will expose the weakness of this overgorged city.
When the drought destroys or checks the wealth of the
country for the time being, and the State income falls by
millions, and those same millions are not available to
spend on more big city schemes, thousands of families
will be out of employment, and we shall see it in a
shrunken skin, howling at everybody and everything
instead of at its own insatiate greed. Had some of the
millions been spent in the country, the latter would
have been provided with better means of com-
munication, and with water conservation schemes ;
and by means of these two necessary things there
would have been satisfactorily settled on the
land the stragglers that now fall into the maw of the
already bloated city. With a carefully-fostered country
behind it, Sydney might grow with a healthy growth;
but, fattened up as it is, its prosperity is frightfully like
a soap bubble, waiting for the first rude puff to burst it.
The last drought lost the State millions of sheep, mostly
because cross-country lines and enough of them were not
in existence to offer quick transport to more favored sec-
tions of the State ; for, bad as any drought is, it never
affects all the country—some spots still have grass going
to waste which, if it were get-at-able quickly and cheaply,
would save millions to the State. There is not even the
excuse that this want has not been realised.
* * * *
We see the country burdened with differential railway
freight as against the city; we see the country paying
up to 12 times as much in passenger rates, and moved
about the country in ancient dog-boxes, at rates of speed
not much swifter than those of the old coaching days.
The city man gets excursion trips at cheap rates over all
the lines every week, whilst the residents in the country
towns, which the city excursionists are able to cheaply
visit, are refused the same opportunities to go to the city,
except at dearer fares. When you get to the Outback the
resident is lucky to get the opportunity of a cheap trip
once in three or four months. Then when the cheap-fare
time comes, how is the Outback resident treated? The
excursion trains are run on goods-train schedules; that
is, for a distance of 400 to 500 miles they average about
15 miles an hour. They are summarily shunted into
sidings where they may be side-tracked for hours. They
usually consist of old, worn-out relics of carriages, having
no lavatory conveniences, with no drinking water sup-
plied, with not an arm-rest in the compartment; and
into a carriage that will hold seven with comfort and
eight on a pinch, you may see 12 to 16 people
packed. The poor devils go through Hell on a trip like
this; and what the children suffer is too painful for
words. And the city Government —it was never a State
Governmeht —thinks this good enough for the country
residents, and is surprised at tne result of the recent
election 1 Ask why these things are allowed to exist, and
no one can give a reason. What sensible reason is there
for the differential freights ? One city man explained to
me that there must be a reason, or the practice would not
exist. That was all he could say. If you go up higher
and ask the State officials, no one can tell you why ; and
I have no hesitation in saying that the Chief Commis-
sioner is not able to give a sound reason for it. If he can
I challenge him it, for I have asked for years
and have not been satisfactorily answered. The success
of the Labor party at the elections is due purely
to the country voter who, having tired of the
waste promises of the Liberals, can see no harm in try-
ing a fresh party (its title is of no importance to him),
with fresh promises. But let that party—at present the
Labor party—be warned that neither it nor any other
breed of politician will be allowed to rule if the majority
of the residents are ignored as they have been in the
past.
* * * *
For the real progress of N. S. Wales a liberal policy of
new railway lines and water conservation is an absolute
necessity. To a land subject to periodical drought,
water is life. Nature provides enough if the man has the
sense to store it; and until millions are spent in doing
this to irrigate the dormant and wonderfully fertile land
of the West, it is pure rot to talk of the State’s great-
ness, or to hope for a population that wjll ever be worthy
of dignifying with the ncpne of nation. What is required
is a fair distribution of the country’s income in city and
country alike. In short, the people demand the decen-
tralisation of the favors now enjoyed almost wholly by
the city residents.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The New Cornstalk Finance.
New Socth Wales has to-day the nearest approach
to a pledged non-borrowing State Government
that it has achieved for haif a century or more.
The avowed policy of the McGowen Ministry is
to charge to loans only those public works which
will pay full interest and 1 per cent, sinking fund,
and to pay for necessary but non-remunerative
works out of revenue. It is a pity that the policy
doesn’t go even a little further; still it is a
remarkable improvement on the methods that
have gone before. The history of “Liberal”
finance has been a dreary business. Up till
the time of Geokge Reid there was a
loose understanding that only “reproduc-
tive” works should be charged to loan funds.
A reproductive work, unfortunately, was almost
anything that the boss politician of the moment
chose to think was reproductive; still, the theory
was fairly well observed. Then came Reid, with
his pose as the marvellous economist who “ light-
ened the people’s burdens,” and trouble began.
Reid sacked civil servants in order to make ends
meet, and charged much of the compensation
money due them to the Civil Service Superannua-
tion Fund, thereby saving his financial counte-
nance by the destruction of a fund built up by the
public servants' own contributions purely as a
provision for old age. The act might have been
called robbery or it might not. He struck the
great idea of making a surplus by not debiting
himself, during the first year of his “cash basis,”
with several hundred thousands of pounds of the
interest on the public debt; and he invented the
disgraceful idea of temporary loans (loans with 30
years’ currency) in aid of revenue, and paid on*
of this loan fund for such ephemeral breakables
as new cups and saucers for the Government
accommodation house at Jenolan. And because
Reid was always willing to injure or depress
an Australian industry in the interests of a
shamelessly unpatriotic gang of importers, the
Freetrade papers cordially approved of his
borrowings and all his financial doings. The
“ Liberals,” after a period of eclipse, came back
to power with the fall of Waddell. This time,
under Carruthers, they repudiated the whole
Reid financial policy. They screamed bitterly for
honesty, for meeting the cost of unproductive
public works out of revenue, for paying a largo
proportion of the cost of productive works out of
revenue—in fact, Carruthers promised to either
abolish borrowing, or at least to reduce it to
£1,000,000 a year; and, on the whole, he leaned
towards abolition. The same Freetrade papers
applauded wildly, and said that this was the
genuine article at last. In the course of a very
few years the next “Liberal” leader (Wade) had
(1) reduced taxation ; (2) ran the borrowings up to
nearly £3,000,000 per annum, apparently to make
up for the loss of tax-money; (3) declared that he
had a gigantic and regular series of surpluses,
though the bigger his surplus the more, appar-
ently, he had to borrow ; (4) taken the allegedly in-
capable spendthrift, Waddell, into his Ministry
as Treasurer. The Freetrade press applauded all
these doings—in fact, whether it was Reid shame-
lessly charging all public works and many small
everyday repairs to loans, or Carruthers
promising to abolish loans, or Wade rushing the
loans up again to the figure of the mad old days,
the Freetrade papers declared that it was Heaven-
born finance and the one thing that the country
required. Finally, the Laborites undertook to
charge all public works to revenue except such as
would pay full interest and 1 per cent, sinking
fund, which really only differed from the attitude
of the Heaven-born Carruthers, six years ago,
in the respect that it was a definite promise,
firmly embedded in the party’s platform, instead
of a hazy undertaking given by one man. And
the Laborites pointed to the alleged great sur-
pluses of the inspired Wade as proof that
the thing could be done. Then the atti-
tude of the Freetrade press was (1) that
an anti-borrowing policy was sheer mad-
ness; (2) that there was no Wade surplus, or
reserve power of taxation, or any other fund from
which it was possible to build even a mile of rail-
way ; (3) that N.S.W. could never pay off any of
its public debt (as it couldn’t pay for a mile of new
railway out of revenue, it obviously couldn’t pay
off the debt on a mile of old railway); (4) that it
was a beggared, hopeless place which could do
nothing without loans; and (5) that its wealth
and prosperity under the “ Liberal ” Government
had been amazing, and that Federation and Pro-
tection had nothing to do with the case. That is
how things stand to-day ; but as parties are very
evenly balanced, there may soon be a new election.
And then the Freetrade papers will either de-
nounce the Labor Government for borrowing too
much or too little, according to Wade’s attitude
at the moment, for Freetrade and “Liberal”
finance is any old thing that suits the moment.
♦
The Noble Art of Coherent Unreliability.
To be a liar is easy, but to be a plausible and
convincing liar is a great deal more difficult than
to tell the truth. Crude lying is the kind that
calls up disembodied spirits. It is used by the
excited little female when she lets her hair down,
and ties herself with a bit of string to the bed-
post, and says that the deed was done by two men,
one 9ft. high and carrying a blood-stained axe, and
the other 6ft. broad and gnashing his teeth. Also,
it leads the faded landlady of the lodging-house to
say that the missing boarder’s jewellery was eaten
by the cat. A lack of finish in its inaccuracy re-
cently led the S. M. Herald to declare that the
Wade Government was allowing the wealth
created by the Barren Jack enterprise to be
annexed by private landowners, and then to
forget that it had made the statement and to
declare that “ the slander is characteristic of the
policy of the Labor party. . . There can be no
excuse for those who make use of it.” But the
same paper made, if possible, a worse break
(20/10/T0) when it shrieked a fearsome shriek in
its leading columns re the Port Darwin railway :
The agreement as embodied in the Bill carries with it a
railway provision—a provision which obliges the Com-
monwealth to connect the Port Darwin section in the
north with the Adelaide to Oodnadatta line in the south.
Such a line would traverse some good country in
the northern portion of the Territory, but it would also
run through some hundreds of miles of desert in the
heart of Australia. It would join Adelaide and Port
Darwin, BUT IT WOULD COME INTO TOUCH WITH
THE RAILWAY SYSTEMS OP NO STATE OTHER THAN
SOUTH AUSTRALIA. .. . Rather than leave room for
misunderstanding as to the Commonwealth’s right to, if
necessary, build that line east so that it may link up the
western terminals of the eastern systems, the Bill had
better be put beneath the table. To anyone who has given
anything like fair attention to the question of a north-south
continental line, it is simply amazing that the South Aus-
tralian proposal could receive an hour’s consideration in
a House with any Federal spirit or business sense. As
has been pointed out before, a detour to the east, if
wisely made, would enable every capital city on the Aus-
tralian mainland, except Perth (AND EVEN PERTH
WHEN THE EAST-WEST CONTINENTAL IS BUILT),
and also every important town on the eastern seaboard,
to be brought into railway communication with Port
Darwin.
That is the lumbering or elephantine or schoolboy
variety of unreliability. In its wild haste to
make a case for bringing the transcontinental line
round, by a great costly deviation, to the neighbor-
hood of its own front door, the paper is prepared
to assert that, if the Port Darwin railway reaches
Adelaide via N.S.W., it will connect at Adelaide
with the proposed Adelaide-Perth line; while, if it
reaches Adelaide without doing this absurd cir-
cumlocution, it can’t connect with the Adelaide-
Perth line there or anywhere else. Which is the
same as saying that, if a man goes from Sydney
railway station via Bondi to the corner of
Pitt and Hunter streets, he will find the
S. M. Herald office there; whereas, if he
comes direct, he won’t find it, for in that
case the Herald Office won’t be there, having, in
fact, fled in disgust to Summer Hill, via Liver-
pool Plains, Bourke and Tenterfield. And appa-
rently the Herald is also prepared to swear in
its haste that there is no railway from Melbourne
to Adelaide ; for it solemnly attests that, if the line
comes due south from Port Darwin to Adelaide, it
will “come into touch with the railway systems
of no State other than S. Australia.” Therefore,
evidently, there can’t be any railway continua-
tion to Melbourne, and the alleged Melbourne-
Adelaide express is only a hoax—the Herald is
plainly prepared to swear to that. Yet, despite
all this trash; it is a simple matter of
a few measurements with a bit of string
upon a reliable map to show that the
straight line south from Port Darwin is the
shortest road from the north to Perth, Adelaide,
Melbourne and Hobart—four capital cities out of
six. The fact that it isn’t quite the shortest line
to the S.M. Herald office is its misfortune ; but
it isn’t possible for every road to lead straight to
the S. M. Herald office, and that building isn’t
quite all Australia.

The Spreading Fame of the N.S.W. Railways.
The thinly-peopled land of Australia wants to
advertise itself in England with a view to attract-
mg the desirable settler with money, and some
parts of it are getting advertisement sure enough.
Unhappily, the ad. is hardly of the right kind.
It is the wildly ridiculous that catches the eye of
the pressman and supplies him with the best
material, so instead of writing about N.S.W.’s
wheatfields and flocks and herds the London
liMEa has lately been studying its amazing rail-
way policy and throwing the olod of wrath
thereat. A few extracts from a recent article
follow :
Besides the illicit influence of the roads and bridges
member there is another influence, more powerful and
quite as evil, that has for a long time prevented the State
railways from doing their proper developmental work.
It is the veto of Sydney on all lines that might take away
traffic. It is possible that in the early days New South
'Vales had not enough produce for export to warrant the
construction of more than one shipping centre. But the,
perhaps then inevitable, concentration on Sydney itself
aggrandised the evil: many districts were hindered in
their natural development, some probably stunted alto-
gether, by the fact that all their produce must travel so
tar to market; and, when railways began to spread into
the northern and southern lands, Sydney influence woke
up to active interference with the natural course
of traffic. The Riverina railways were deliberately
left unconnected with the Murray and the one little
private line that jutted up from it into New South Wales ;
differential rates were arranged to divert consignments
from the river route to South Australia, and the 200-mile
or less railway-route to Melbourne, over the weary four
or five hundred miles to Sydney—unprofitable' for the
railway accounts, but greatly to the profit of Sydney
agents and merchants. The debates of the many Federa-
tion conferences are full of this differential rates question,
and even long after the Commonwealth had come into
existence complaints about them were rife between
States (for Sydney, of course, was not the only offender ;
each State capital snatched at traffic for itself, irrespec-
tive of the welfare of the country folk). And, though
differential rates are supposed to be a thing of the past,
deliberate disconnections are very much alive. The late
Premier told the people of Murwilluinbah (over 600 miles
from Sydney by road and less than 100 from Brisbane)
that they should get 20 miles of railway bridging the gap
to the Queensland border after the 450 miles of gap towards
Sydney had been bridged. And a recent request for a 12-
mile junction in Riverina between Finley and Toeumwal
which would give the wheat-growers of Southern Riverina
a 150-mile route to the sea instead of a 450-mile one—was
met with flat refusal by the present Minister for Works,
on the ground that “ this link would enable the traffic to
go away from lines that were constructed to enable the
producers to reach the Sydney market.” The Herald
summed up the Minister’s speech thus :
“ He reiterated that he was going to do his best to
maintain Sydney’s grip on the Riverina trade.”
It is this determination to maintain Sydney’s grip that
has for so many years blocked the opening of coastal
ports ; it was at the bottom—and often on the surface,
too—of Sydney’s bitter antagonism to Dalgety as the
Federal capital, since that involved the opening of Two-
fold Bay as the port for the south-eastern districts. . . .
The traffic has got out of hand. The farmer, to quote
one of them, finds that “ the struggle up to the point of
railway contact has been successful, but we are badly
beaten at the station.” And it all happens because the
produce of 300,000 square miles of country has to be
dragged to Sydney, and, arriving there, has to be dealt
with in one little patch of foreshore. Even Newcastle,
which has a railroad to it, and past which all the wheat
of the splendid Namoi valley is hauled, has no room or
appliances for shipping that wheat direct. . . .
The wheat-sellers reckon that at least £250,000 has
been lost this season by exposure of wheat in transit to
the weather—mainly, to quote the Telegraph, “ by ex-
posure to what may be termed normal weather at un-
protected sidings, in insufficiently protected sheds, or in
trucks not properly covered.” But the sheds would not
be needed, and the term of exposure would be much
shortened, if the trains could travel faster; and the
trains could travel much faster if they had double lines,
shorter journeys and different termini.. ..
Consider the case of a squatter near Condoliolin, who
in time of drought wants to transfer his sheep to well-
watered paddocks near Gunnedah—a perfectly possible
case. At present empty trucks must be sent to him from
Homebush, close to Sydney—327 miles; loaded, they
must go back that same 327 miles, and then be hauled
another 287 miles and more northwards. And in the end
his sheep will be less than 250 miles away.
It all tends, of course, to make N.S.W. known
in England; but it is just possible that it would
pay the State better not to be known than to be
known in that fashion.

Brahma, McGowen and the Young Lady of
Niger.
Liberalism, we feel sure, will not be lacking in gene-
rosity if Mr. McGowen for his part is not lacking in
discretion, and just now discretion is a great deal the
better part of valor. —S. M. Herald.
India possesses an institution called Brahmanism
that has the absorbent qualities of a sponge. It is
a gorgeous affair, with priests and temples, and
traditions, and vestments, and cash, and naked
worshippers, and miracles, and cant, and dirt,
and flowers, and sacred books, and holy
cows, and saints, and incantations, and mys-
tery and mummery. At various times re-
form associations have been started for the
purpose of heaving bricks at it. These opposition
shows flourished for a while, but Brahmanism
gathered them all in. It didn’t matter what they
taught. It didn’t matter how much road-metal
they had been chucking at Brahm. BRAHMsaid they
were all part of IT, and with a big gulp swallowed
them down—road-metal and all. Now', that is
just what the S. M. Herald thinks Liberalism
ought to do. Liberalism is really Toryism, which
swallowed Liberalism some time ago; and the
Herald invites Labor to walk into the same
capacious jaws. “Don’t be nasty, McGowen;
come and take an inside seat, and we’ll do all in
our power to make you comfortable ! Don’t stand
■out in the rain longer than you can help. Oh,
yes; bring the Trades Hall and the caucus with
you too ! ” Thus the Brahman Herald pleads
with McGowen to be nice and give himself as a
meal for the famished tiger—the same tiger,
McGowen may remember, that flirted with the
Nigerian young lady.
Concerning an Old. Lunatic.
Dear Bulletin, —If you happen to see the Law
doddering round your way, I wish you would
grasp him by the horse-hair and pour this letter
down his ear-trumpet. He is a terrible old ass, and
anybody seems to be able to take him down these
days. Does he announce that the importer and
the retail trader are selling 14oz. of goods in a tin
and calling it lib. ; or f of a pint in a bottle, and
charging for an entire pint; or serving beer in
pint mugs that are only about half-pint mugs;
or guaranteeing in a flourish of false label that
this, that and the other brands of food are of the
highest possible standard—what happens? No-
thing ; except that the importer and the retailer
are put to a little expense to have strips of paper
printed, upon which information is provided, to
this effect: —
This tin contains only 14oz. of jam.
This bottle is guaranteed to hold about three-quarters
of a pint.
These mugs do not contain as much as they ought to.
This food is not guaranteed under the Act, and is
probably poisonous.
Then, as far as I can see, the Law says, “Well,
what more can I do ? ’’ and takes the count-out.
Or else it rushes home, and makes some new legal
furniture, say for the safety of the lives, comfort
and prosperity of those who travel by sea. Which
in turn is met by the shipping cos. printing on
the backs of their tickets and bills of lading words
to this effect: —
Nothing herein contained, and no arrangemen or
agreement, or suggested or implied arrangemen
agreement, shall be binding on this company The
ticket is issued only on the condition that Ntorni, ,
religion, drunkenness, accident, hard luck, forgetfulness,
wilful neglect, act, occurrence, or anything else is trie
entire and sole fault of the passenger or shipper, ah
outside that shall be debited as an act of God, and the
passengers or shippers can do what they like about it.
Not long ago the old mule went out of its way to
bring pubkeepers up with a round turn that had
been long overdue in N.S.W. And, just as might
Vie expected, it got left high and dry once more.
I took a room at one of Sydney’s leading hostels the
other day, and this is what I received with the
number and key of my room :
No Person shall be accepted as an occupier of any room
in this Establishment except upon the conditions that
the Company is not liable for the loss or injury to any
article or articles of property, of any kind whatsoever,
whether money or otherwise, belonging to such person,
and whether under the Value of Twenty Pounds or other-
wise, in or about any part of the Company’s premises,
anything contained in the “Innkeepers Act 1902,” or
any other Act to the contrary notwithstanding.
Anything contained in the Innkeepers Act 1902,
or any other Act notwithstanding, Now, suppos-
ing I hang out my sign thus :
Gideon, garrotter and sandbagger. Notwithstanding
anything in the criminal code, I shall not be respon-
sible for the murder or mutilation of any citizen at any
time, and no sheriff or police officer shall, under warrant
of the law—which I hereby publicly repudiate—interfere
with me in any way whatsoever. God Save the King !
That is quite as reasonable as the other dodges
above quoted ; and I give notice that on next sit-
ting day I will move that the House do now con-
sider the ad visabilitv of passing an Act to prevent
the Law being a darned lunatic. —Yours franti-
cally, Gideon.

The fact that the N.S.W. Upper House must go
is now too obvious for debate. If that crowd of
rather elderly nominees votes according to its
political conscience, it will Vie necessary for the
Government to appoint about 50 or 60 new mem-
bers in order to get its measures through. And
if the “Liberals” get in again next election,
which is quite possible, they will have to send
up another crowd in order to get their mea-
sures through. And if there is for a few elections
a sea-saw of parties, which is quite possible when
the numbers are so even, there will be a steady
series of appointments until the Upper House
will consist of about 500 members. In short, if
the Upper House votes according to its principles
it is going to be a bloated and elephantine
nuisance, and if it doesn’t vote according to its
principles it will be a depraved ruffian. Just
consider what the situation would be in the
Lower House if the defeated members never went
out after an election, and the newly-elected
members simply crowded in on top of them, and
politicians who had lost every contest for 40
years were still sitting. Also, if defeated Gov-
ernments didn’t go out though new ones came in,
so that the last surviving Minister of the tenth
Cabinet before last was still struggling with his
nine successors for possession of the office chair.
That is likely to Vie the Upper House situation un-
less that aged and infirm body is chased off the
premises. Upper Houses of life nominees answer
fairly well if one party is going to remain in office
for ever, or if parties are so much alike that the
difference doesn’t signify. But in live politics
that kind of body is either a snag or an echo,
and neither of these is worth the gas-bill.

Victoria’s Weary Government recently sent
irrigation expert Elwood Mead and Minister of
Lands McKenzie to Europe in quest of immi-
grants. The following is from a pamphlet
published by them, and entitled, “ Victoria, Aus-
tralia’s Irrigation State ” :
The Government is prepared to erect houses and effect
other necessary improvements in advance of settlement,
so that it can with truth be said that a settler who begins
with dairying may receive a cheque for his dairy produce
within a fortnight of the commencement of his work.
If that means anything at all it means that
Victoria invites settlers on the understanding
that their blocks will Vie fenced, houses, sheds,
etc., erected, crops and lucerne be ready to
cut on their arrival, and all they have to
do will be to acquire their cows and start
extracting milk. Twenty of these MEAD-captured
settlers are due to reach Melbourne this month,
and 250, with their families, are expected before
the end of the year. Until a month ago the
Weary Cabinet had done absolutely nothing to
prepare for them. Then it got a crawl on.
To-day it has 40 blocks at Cohuna, 25 at
Swan Hill, and 54 at Cornelia Creek sur-
veyed—and that is all. Not one block has been
fenced,' nor a single house erected. No grading
or levelling—a first necessity for irrigating forage
crops—has been done; not an acre of lucerne or
other fodder has been planted. But the tired
crowd at this end has done something to keep the
promises made through the energetic missionary
at the other end—it has let one contract for a
subsidiary distributing channel! Remembering
that the crops must be sown in Victoria Viet ween
March and June, the immigrants who accepted
the promises made in the pamphlet must
necessarily wait nearly 12 months before
their first “ fortnightly cheque ” comes
in, even supposing the Government bogs in
something extra in the meantime, and grades and
levels their blocks and constructs channels. They
encountered Mead, and were apparently satis-
fied ; now they are going to become acquainted
with Weary, and they have a considerable ex-
perience before them. The worst of the trouble,
as far as concerns Australia, is that, when they
find how they have been fooled, they will publish
the facts where they will do most harm ; and all
Mead’s eloquence and Yes-No’s after-dinner
rhetoric won t avail against their bald narratives.

Some years ago, certain Lilydale and Warburton
landowners asked the Victorian Government for
a railway. The Government told them the line
wouldn’t pay at once, but it would build one if
they would agree to make good the loss for
a specified number of years. They were to form
a trust, which was to levy the necessary rate
(whatever it might be) on all lands benefited by
the line. It was a fair offer, and the landowners
enthusiastically accepted it—and ever since have
been trying to crawl out of their liability. Last
week a deputation was advancing some curious
reasons why this swindle should be perm i tted, when
John Weary got tired, and said he “ didn’t know
what was coming over the people. When they
make a bargain with a private person they never
dream of breaking it, but when they make a bar-
gain with the State they seem to have no com-
punction in trying to repudiate it by any means
possible. . . . The trust seemed to have struck
some of the hungriest, meanest skunks of land-
owners he ever remembered.” Then, having
delivered himself of more observations to similar
effect, the rev. gentleman remarked that, if they
were relieved of some of their obligations, they
would have more money to spend on development,
wherefore he would be pleased to do what he could
for them—and the deputation departed, smiling all
over. Which explains, of course, just what John
Weary said he couldn’t understand. As a moral
reformer John knows that there are some ladies
who have a good name and a few who have the
other sort; and the lady who owns the good name
owns it because, if she was ever “approached”
once, she didn’t make it worth anybody’s while to
repeat the experiment.

“0.K.”: Prendergast, who leads the futile
Opposition in the Vic. Assembly, was asked re-
cently to present a petition against Premier
Murray’s Bill for suppressing Sunday gate-money
entertainments. Whereupon he announced that
he was in sympathy with Murray’s Bill, on the
ground that “any interference with the ‘Day of
Rest’ ought to be deprecated by friends of the
working-man.” Which strikes me as even more
offensively hypocritical than the Sabbatarian cant
that is talked by true-blue wowsers. Would
Prendergast be prepared, if given the oppor-
tunity, to put an end to all railway, tramway and
excursion steamer service, and again shut up
Melbourne National Gallery on the Sabbath ?
Going a step further, would he shut up the
churches where parsons perform services and de-
liver lectures, and organistsand choristers do musi-
cal work, and vergers earn their wages ? Probably
not; and yet these things march logically with
his doctrine that, on the “ Day of Rest,” none
shall labor, no matter how they may want to nor
how inconvenient it may be to the remainder of the
community if they stay idle. If a certain fixed
Day of Rest were conserved to all workers, there
could be no church trains, no excursion trips by
rail or boat, no doctoring, no gas or electric light-
ing, no sort whatever of public recreation for the
people. And the State would be plain Sheol.
“Six days shalt thou labor, and on the seventh
thy world shall be compulsorily dull, undoctored
and dreary ” is Prendeiigast’s idea, seem-
ingly, of a fitting commandment for the
Labor party. The straight-out wowsers’ posi-
tion in regard to Sabbatarianism is under-
standable. Not so that of the Labor mem-
ber who argues for a Day of Rest, pure and
undefiled, “in the interests of the workers,”
though he well knows that the workers are going
to be horribly inconvenienced by it. Come to
think of it, most of the supporters of Murray’s
Bill are either straight wowsers or crooked
sophists. Labor parties—Federal or provincial —
include a proportion of crooked sophists.

If some of the “great Australian dailies” would
only appoint a commission of one, with himself in
the chair, to decide where they really stand, it
would be a relief to a bewildered public. As a
case in point, this appeared in the S. M. Herald: —
Australia .. . has borrowed, not for war or largely for
defence, but for tangible assets, such as railways, train-
ways, waterworks and harbors—all of which were neces-
sary to the development of a new country bigger than
the United States and more than one-fourth the area of
the whole British Empire. Its development has been
unique, and its debt is unique. It is time it was con-
solidated, for there are signs it will not be allowed to
grow at the same rate as it has grown in the past. In
FUTURE, MONEY FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES WILL BE RAISED
BY TAXATION, AND NOT BY LOAN. THEREFORE, IT IS WELL
THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONTROL THE PUBLIC
DEBT.
These are exactly the sort of statements that The
Bulletin has been making for 20 years past,
and this paper applauds them warmly. But a
few days ago there was a certain “ Liberal ” party
raging in N.S.W. and declaring that it was quite
impossible to build even a mile of railway without
loans. It heaped ridicule and scorn on the very
mild proposal of the Laborites that the State
should only borrow for such works as would pay
full interest on their cost and 1 per cent, sinking
fund, and should charge any other works to reve-
nue, and it declared that it was quite impractic-
able to charge any works to revenue. And the
S. M. Herald, which cordially supported that
party, now says that it wants to charge all works
to revenue. It declares itself an anti-borrowing
paper, which cordially supports a whole-hog
borrowing party as against a half-hog, non-
borrowing party. Also, the Herald is presum-
ably in favor of more taxation ; with the falling
off in the returns from the Commonwealth it will
not be easy to construct large public works out of
revenue otherwise. Yet the Herald boomed
Wade because he promised not to levy extra
taxes, and it denounced the Labor party on the
plea that it meant to do so. A paper like that
ought to start a bloodhound after itself to find out
where it is located.

“ Liberal” appeals to our reason :
Last month London Evening News printed the life-
storv of an admirable man. I quote this from it :
“ Sixty-five years in the service of one family ! This is
the record of John Durham, whom I found weighing
peas on a farm near here (Selby, Yorks, England). When
I asked him how long he had been employed by the
Jacques family he said :, ‘ I started for the present mas-
ter’s father on Good Friday in 1845. In those days we
worked from 4 o’clock in the morning until dark in the
summer, and in winter from 5 o’clock until bedtime.
My wages when I started were 6d. per week and food,
afterwards rising, when I was in my teens, to 50s. a year.
The only holidays we had were Feast Monday, Good
Friday and Christmas Day. When I was 23 years I got
married; my wages then were 12s. per week, and we had
to pay our rent out of that. Finally, I got up to lGs. per
week.”
He was the respected father of 20 children, and is now
put outside the possibility of want by being rewarded
with “ relief from the parish.” It is when one considers
the record of Britishers like John Durham that
the ingratitude and foolishness of the Australian
working-man, with his ceaseless struggles to grab
more and more wages at less and less expenditure
of honest toil, become apparent. But for crude
experimental laws, the inspiration of uneducated Social-
istic dreamers—Factory Acts, Early Closing Acts, Arbi-
tration Acts, and the like—the laborer would still be
content to go on doing honest toil 16 hours a day for a
shilling or two a week, till he died or “ went on the
parish.” An era of wild-cat labor legislation has, how-
ever, set in. Private Enterprise is checked when it
attempts to employ persons like honest John Durham.
Economic doctrines are flouted ; the law of supply and
demand is interfered with, and, as a result, it is now
practically impossible to hire married men at 12s. a week
anywhere outside a few half-savage countries. Socialism,
that Menace which George Reid set out to fight four
years ago, and which Joseph Cook, and Mr. Wade are
still valiantly combating, has done its destructive work
so well that to-day you might search the Commonwealth
and not find a John Durham.
And the end is not yet. The sturdy breed of late-and-
early toilers at 12s. per week is extinct. It has been
succeeded by earners of £l, 30s.—aye, as much as £2 per
week. And even these show unrest and dissatisfaction
at times. They clamor for higher pay, shorter shifts,
closed tram-fronts, better-ventilated mines and a hun-
dred more unreasonable things. Is it any wonder that
capital leaves the country, while Liberal employers are
forced to band together and spend thousands on leaflets,
free teas, electioneering placards, hoarding cartoons and
other anti-Labor propaganda ?
-
“Locust”: That matter of the Wade Govern-
ment’s pamphlet, bearing the imprint, “ William
Applegate Gullick, Government Printer,” has
been mentioned in The Bulletin ;, but it deserves
some further attention. There is too much dis-
position to allow election scandals to be forgotten
when polling day has passed. Two questions
arise: (1) Did the Wade high priests of
Private Enterprise get their election pamphlet
printed at the expense of the general taxpayer
in the Socialistic Government Printing Office,
free of charge to them ? or (2) are they paying a
Socialistic Government service to do work which
ought to have been subjected to the benign influ-
ences of competition and private enterprise? If
they are sponging on the taxpayer, then some
sort of punishment should be inflicted, in the in-
terests of honesty and fair dealing, over and
above the rendering of a bill for the printing at
market rates. If they are paying William
Applegate Gullick for doing their printing,
then I wonder whether W. A.G. (Govt. Printer,
1910) can do my printing, or yours, or whether he
is allowed to take the bread out of the mouths of
the various taxpaying printers of Sydney,
who almost to a man, object to Socialism,
and yet support the Government of Wade.
If a political party may use the Government
Printing Office in this State, I should not be sur-
prised next to hear that its members have their
clothes made in the State clothing factory ; their
gardens looked after by men from the Socialistic
Botanic Gardens, their motor rides in State
motors driven by Socialistic chauffeurs ; and their
delinquencies, when they come before the beaks,
for review (there was one such instance, when a.
Cabinet Minister exceeded the speed limit with
his own or a State motor-car), defended by limbs,
of the law from the Socialistic Crown Law De-
partment. Perhaps the new Government will!
have information supplied, in order that it may be'
available when Mr. Wade next denounces national!
or municipal coal, gas, ferries, and other enter-
prises, and prates of the lily-wliiteness and con-
sistency of his own Government’s administration.
The Sydney dailies printed two views anentja
vital subject on the 19th inst. At North Sydney,
Garland, M.L.C., said
Of all its measures, the Government was most proud of
its Industrial Disputes Act, which, he claimed, was the
greatest boon conferred on the working classes of the
whole State. He hoped the Act would be one of the first
the Labor Government would endeavor to repeal.
About the same time. Judge Heydon was saying
this, in the Industrial Court :
It seems to me that this Wages Board system will break
down. It used not to be so under the old Act; but,
under the new Act, we have industries subdivided and
again re-subdivided so that each union may have a Board
to itself, or the employers may have as many or as few as
they think fit.
The public is thus offered its. pick between the
opinion of Garland, special pleader for Wade-
isra and all its works, and that of Judge Heydon
—who is special pleader for no party platform,
and who speaks from an experience gained while
administering the Industrial Disputes Act since
its first introduction by the Wade Government.
Also, if Judge Heydon is right as to the hopeless-
ness and futility of the Act of which he has such,
a special and intimate knowledge, and if this Act;
is the one that occasions the leaders of the-
“ Liberal ” cause most pride, what in the name of'
Horror is the calibre of the legislation about which'
Garland and the rest feel they are not entitled to<
boast ?

The Commonwealth Parliament is being aslcedl
to consider the case of a person named Orme.
OrmE, who is an ex-Victorian engine-man, drove
trains for J. Bull during the Boer War. At this
job he suffered an accident which damaged him
permanently, and, apparently as compensation
for his injuries, he was appointed manager of the
Military Club at Waterval Boven, S’Africa, (in
November 24, 1901, while in that service, he was
arrested by the military authorities, and, being
brought before a court-martial, was fined £25 on
these principal charges:—
In that he, at Waterval Boven, on or about the 21st
November, 1901, had in bis possession cigars and
cigarettes without the authorised Custom duty bands.
In that he, at Waterval Boven, on or about the 21st
October, 1901, was in possession of, and sold whisky to
employees of the Imperial Military Railway without
having first obtained a license to sell liquors.
Later, the Judge Advocate-General refused to
confirm these and a minor conviction recorded
against him, whereupon Orme was released from
the custody in which he had been illegally de-
tained since the court-martial had delivered its
judgments. Almost immediately, however, he
was re-arrested and expelled into Portuguese ter-
ritory, where he had to wait several weeks till he
could get a passport to leave the country. That
is substantially the story of John Orme’s suffer-
ings, and, as an Australian, he is now appealing
through the Australian Parliament for justice and
reparation. There appears to be little doubt that
he has a substantial case against J. Bull. In
the first place, he was never legally tried,,
since a military tribunal had not the power
to consider his alleged offences. Secondly, the*
court-martial was probably illegally constituted,
since it included two officers who were directly-
interested in the result of the inquiry. Orme:
alleges that from these two court-martiallers he-
had actually bought portion of the “ smokes ” and
all of the whisky mentioned in the charges. More-
over, these two persons were members of the club
committee which either instructed or authorised
him to sell liquors and tobacco upon the club pre-
mises. This allegation, moreover, explains why a
court-martial was quietly arranged to try Orme,
instead of allowing him to be passed on to a public
civil court. The fact was that the canteen was
illegal; the authorities had got to hear of
it, and somebody had to be the scapegoat.
Their first plan failed when the Judge-Advocate
refused to confirm the sentence. Things were
then getting dangerous; the officers’ complicity
in the sale of the uncustomed goods was in danger
of transpiring, so Orme had to be hustled out of
the country. And hustled he was. Surely, if we
have not lost our capacity for solemn wonder, we
must feel awed at that example of British Army

In searching round for points wherewith to
embarass the N.S.W. Labor Government,
Sydney Telegraph hit first on the plan of
urging it to “ make good its pledge to in-
stantly destroy the Wages Boards.” As a fact,
the Government never promised to destroy the
Wages Boards. The Industrial Disputes Actis pre-
cisely the same in principle as that which Labor
initiated and which “Liberals” then damned.
Labor has, therefore, no objection to the principle
of the Industrial Disputes Act, hut only to its
cumbrous machinery. Nor has it ever lacked
convincing evidence in suport of that objection.
Only last week Judge Hey DON, who should know,
said
It seems to me that this Wages Board system will
breakdown. VVehave industriesdivided and subdivided
and again re-subdivided, or the employers may have as
many or as few as they think fit.
And the Telegraph, on the day this paper went
to press, printed the following :
For the first time the Industrial Court of N. S. Wales
lias decided to sit outside of Sydney. About 90 cases
have piled up in the Northern Rivers district, and the
Court proceeds there next week. It opens at Lismore on
November 2, where cases will be heard from Murwil-
luinbah, Ballina, Bangalow, Casino and Lismore. On
November 7 the Court is due to sit at Grafton. The
unions concerned are the United Furniture Trades, the
Sawmill Employees, the Tailors, and Coach and Car
Builders.
This indicates the whole trouble with the Wages
Board system. Twenty-one Wages Boards have
already sat in connection with the business con-
trolled by one man— John Brown of Newcastle.
In any ordinary coal-mine there may be a dozen
industries to be adjudicated on. Each must
have its own Wages Board, its own highly-
salaried President and its own set of wit-
nesses. What is expected of the McGowen
Administration at this stage is, not that it shall
butt in wildly and uproot the Industrial Court,
but that it shall rationalise the institution. What
would probably meet the case would be the insti-
tution of one or more tribunals with the power to
group together eo-related industries, and consider
them in the mass. Thus it would be feasible for
one Court to handle all the industries connected
—say —with the business of coal-mining, just as,
under the old Act, one Court successfully handled
all the industries connected with silver-mining.

From the S. M. Herald two days before the
N.S.W. election :
Though there is a Socialist Ministry ruling France,
Ministers have made very plain their intention of stand-
ing up strongly against any act which will imperil the
safety of the State. Men, no matter of what political
belief, when they attain Ministerial office find that they
must drive the machine of State, that the machine must
not drive them, and that if any part of the machine does
not work well, and cannot be repaired, it must be dis-
carded and a new part put in its place. In the postal
strike in France, M. Clemknceau, the then Premier,
showed that tie would rule, that he was in the position
of power, and Socialist or Radical though the striker
may be, the interests of the State came first, and must be
served.
This amounted to a casting of dead cats at one of
the oldest-established of Anti-Sosh arguments—
a contention that dates from the G. Reid period,
when it was laid down that wherever a Socialist
Government gets on top, the interests of the
State are immediately subordinated to those of
a few hoggishly-seltisb and ignorant revolu-
tionaries, as a result of which Capital
flees a ruined country in a state of panic.
Still later, one of the main standbys of WADE-ism
was the blandly impudent claim that,.since it
stood for the grand old - cause of “Liberalism,” it
alone was competent to govern the State in an
equitable and satisfactory fashion. The Herald’s
sudden admission that “Socialism” can accom-
plish this job equally well was an accidental body-
blow that knocked its own party breathless.
“ H.H.” writes
The fiendish row that is now in progress re the Oohuna
(Vic.) land resumptions’ is a whole essay on the merits
of an efficient progressive land tax. YVhether Cohuna
was a gigantic fraud or only a silly blunder, the fact re-
mains that the Government fell in badly. Years ago
Victoria realised that, unless it was to sink to third or
fourth place among the States, it must break up its huge
properties and make room for small setttlers. A pro-
gressive land tax, if big enough, would have broken
up the bloated holdings, and kept them broken ;
but Victoria’s House of Landlords declared that
such a thing would be a shocking interference with
private property'. So the Government proceeded to
buy properties on the voluntary principle. The owners
of good land didn’t particularly want to sell ; it suited
their dignity to be srreat territorial magnates, and,
besides, they had created such an artificial land famine
that they could let their land at almost incredible rents
if they felt so inclined. Still, provided they were offered
a preposterous figure, some of them were disposed to
part. A Closer Settlement Board, which was ordered to
buy land, and which would lose its job if it didn’t buy
land, met these men who didn’t particularly want to sell
land, and fell in. It didn’t mind that, for it was
there for the purpose. But when it began to suspect
that one or more public servants had been buy-
ing land and re-selling it to the Board at a
huge advance, and that it bad, in the inno-
cence of its soul, once hired the real owner of the
land to valueit for purchase, it feltfoolish and hot behind
the ears. So an investigation is being carried on, and
the number of things that are not being discovered is
wonderful. The affair seems hardly worth the trouble
and fuss. The whole repurchase business is a fraud. The
Board was there to be swindled, and if one person swindled
it instead of another it didn’t matter so very much. Its
business was to pay absurd prices for rocks, and amid the
whole wretched scandal it was much the same if it boug-iit
a public official’s rocks or a private speculator’s. Even if
the members had sold themselves their own rocks, it
couldn’t have made things much worse. Nothing could
make that sort of position much worse.
The futile “Liberals” of N.S.W. con-
stituted the small-borrowing or no-borrowing
party at the beginning of the Carruthers Ministry
six years ago. That was when they drove the
wretched Waddell from office because he spent
£2,288,742 of loan money in his final year. Now,
because the Labor party has also become a small-
borrowing or no-borrowing crowd, the shiftless
hand-to-mouth “Liberals” have become a big-
loan crowd. This is Sydney Telegraph’s latest
attitude (24/10/T0): —
New South Wales has a debt of £92,500,000, which has
been increased by £27,200,000 during the past 10 years.
. . . The adequate development of the country calls for a
considerably larger outlay of borrowed capital during the
next 10 years than during the decade which has just
passed, and no party could possibly face the country for
long without doing its best to satisfy the needs, of the
people. There must of necessity be upwards of £20,000,000
expended upon the State railways prior to 1920, and if the
other works foreshadowed are to be provided, another
£10,000,000 at least will be called for, and we have cer-
tainly to look forward to a debt, of £125,000,000, or more,
10 years hence. Probably it will be more.
So the newest “Liberal” idea is to fix the loan
expenditure at an average of £3,250,000 a year.
In fact, it holds that its own crowd was abso-
lutely reprehensible for not borrowing enough.

The advent of a Labor Government has
not operated to'the detriment of “Paid in Full.”
the Sydney Royal show. There was a pretty
general impression in “Liberal” circles that, if the
Wade Government was defeated, J. C. W. and Co.
would immediately disband their theatrical com-
panies, pawn or sell most of their props, and re-
move the entire capital of the concern to China,
Russia or some other country unafflicted with the
Labor Menace. But the prudent scheme hangs
fire. The only effect of the tragedy of the 14th,
so far as “Paid in Full” is concerned, is that
houses are more plethoric than ever. Possibly
“Liberalism” is cramming in all the theatre-
going that is possible, before the inevitable period
of Ruin dawns. Anyhow, for the present, busi-
ness at the Royal is as good as though the Sosh
Tiger had never been whelped.
** * *
The duty of re-stating the obvious once
more devolves on this paper. Wherefore: Miss
Gibbs is still at Her Majesty’s (Sydney); so is
Hughie; also, Timothy Gibbs; likewise the
chorus. The crowds that flock to see these
attractive folks show no diminution. All is well.

To-morrow evening will see the last of
“ The Night of the Party ”at the Criterion. The
foodless revel will be succeeded by “Mr. Preedy
and the Countess,” the work of Carton, the man
who perpetrated “ Lady Huntworth’s Experi-
ment.” People who remember that joyous pro-
duction, in which Mrs. Brough was the cook-
peeress, and was haunted by a beery and stone-
broke peer-husband who fell into the kitchen
sink, will view the new show in a hopeful
spirit. By way of an omen, Miss Mab Paul, the
massive and handsome leading lady, was bailed
up by a solicitor of the highway one recent night,
and smote him in her anger, so that he flew back-
wards into last week and disappeared with a
shocking crash amid the years that the locust hath
eaten. This evidently signifies a capacity to
triumph over all obstacles, and promises well for
the new production.

The two Gilberts, whose business is
dancing, represent the one new turn of the week
at Sydney Tivoli. Some turns are merely turns
for the worse; but the Gilberts are a revolution
in the other direction. The members of the
whirling Kremo Family are the 10 main-
stays or king-poles of the show; their
season, however, concludes on Saturday night.
Graeie Grahame has another 10 evenings in
which to prove she is the keg of mischief
the advertisement says she is. Woods and Fraser,
Brown and Robinson, and the Quealys have
changed their programmes, and the show, so far
as they are concerned, does not bear such a strik-
ing resemblance to previous ones. Tom Dawson
and Olga Grey are still to be seen and heard, and
there is no mention of iast nights—which is a cir-
cumstance to be grateful for. The new beer-
garden first part is only a week old, and still
retains the delicious fragrance of a clean pub full
of good brands plucked from the wowsing.

At Spencer’s Theatrescope the gliding re-
production of the Arnst-Barry race on the Zam-
besi is in its last nights ; so the sport who has been
waiting for the crowded houses to thin down had
better hie him, to the booking-office and reserve
his seat. C. B. Fry, training the boy of the bull-
dog breed on board the Mercury, ■ is in-
teresting hunk of solid information 475 ft.
long, which shows where at least some of the
men who will fight the foreign Dreadnoughts
in the next great war will come from. “The
House with the Closed Shutters ” is one of those
dramatic and picturesque mysteries to which the
cinematograph lends itself so admirably. The
pathetic note is struck with “By the Faith of a
Child,” and the scenic department reels through
Athens, the town where Mr. Pericles used to boss
things. Foolshead continues his escapades, and
is, for the nonce, on the side of law’n’order.

One of the glories of the Sydney Glaci-
arium is the picture of the new home for this old
and reliable show, now in process of construction,
at a cost of £50,000. The pictures shown on the
screen are a cinematograph snapshot of the archi-
tect’s plans—an interesting film. The film of the
week is “The House with the Closed Shutters.”
The story is that of Charles Randolph, his
mother and sister, survivors of a fine old fighting
family in the Confederate States. Charles is
placed on General Lee’s staff, but he has a weak-
ness. Love of anything on which a man can get
tight is a religion with him. Sent on a dangerous
mission, he takes a few to keep his spirits up,
and as his spirits rise his intelligence goes
down. He gets home, howling drunk, and his
sister dons his uniform, fulfils his mission,
and is shot down on her return through foolishly
rushing into battle. The world is informed that
Charles Randolph has died a hero’s death. His
mother, grim old patriot, says : “ Close the shut-
ters that none may know my daughter has died
to shield a coward and a drunkard. Henceforth,
you stay inside.” And stay inside he does, till
he goes to Hades.
V: * * *
“ Medico ” :
The S. M. Herald’s criticism of “Paid in Full” con-
tained the following : “ It is necessary to warn the main
body of playgoers that ‘ Paid in Full ’ is quite unfitted
for the youthful, and that in its sexual aspect it is un-
mistakably outspoken." The smug comment is interest-
ing as showing the seemingly incurable tendency of
highly-moral papers to confuse what is merely ugly with
what is demoralising. Clement Scott, who found
nothing to rail at in the attractive pornographies of the
Gaiety shows of his day, damned highly-moral plays like
“Ghosts’’and “Mrs. Warren’s Profession ” as deliberate
assaults on British purity. Generali}' speaking, the
middle-classes (in the sense of the semi-educated classes)
of the Anglo-speaking races have always shown this
insensate tendency to be shocked at books and plays
which picture vice and the results thereof in a revolting
light, and to greet with applause works wherein vipe is
subtly made to appear alluring. A deplorable instance
of muddy-mindedness.
There are two sexual episodes in “Paid in Full,” one
where the husband urges his wife to offer herself to
Williams, his villainous old employer ; the ottier where
Williams babbles with the revolting frankness of the
Truly Bad concerning his youthful amours. Certainly
the language is fairly plain, as stage talk goes ; but there
is nothing in either of the episodes to harm the morals
of the most prurient adolescent that ever patronised
the drama. A potential love affair which circles round
a horror of the type of Captain Williams is about as
stimulating, on the erotic side, as a cask of ruined beer,
or a very old paving-stone. Indeed, the strangest feature
of “ Paid in Full ” is its quaintly Arcadian outlook. There
is a thoroughly worthy little wife, and a good, strong
man-friend into whose honest heart no evil thought ever
enters; but, all through the piece, Passion is presented
as a peculiarly sordid and unpleasant thing.
Compare the case (say) of “ The Waltz Dream,” against
which no protests were raised on behalf of the innocent
youth of the community. Here, a charming girl was
lepresented as seeing an agreeable young man and con-
ceiving a frankly animal passion for him on the spot.
The two made love with astonishing fervor, and after a
kiss, whose duration and intensity earned it a cosmo-
politan fame, retired and locked themselves in a summer-
house, leaving the spectators with the best of excuses for
imagining the worst. And any theatre-goer can cite a
dozen other recent plays in which the same sort of sug-
gestiveness has gone unchided.
The ethical attitude of the unthinking middle-class
man appears to be that a play or a book may hint like
blazes so long as it doesn’t speak right out; it may use
• synonyms, but it must dodge the unforgivable word ; it
may suggest with such violence as to drive the youthful
mind in quest of information to all sorts of undesirable
places, but it mustn’t teach. The master-idea at the
back of it all is that “the youthful” must be kept
ignorant as long as possible of the physiological facts of
life j and that anything which tends to dispel that
ignorance is “immoral.”
It is this insane old fetich—one that intelligent
folk have been combating since the Early Victorian
period—which I yearn to smite. Sixteen years ago the
New Review took a census as to the wisdom of being en-
tirely outspoken with the youthful regarding sexual
matters, and teaching ydung people everything it was
possible for them to know on this topic at the earliest
opportunity. Amongst the vast majority who warmly
approved were Thomas Hardy, Walter Besant, Bjornson,
Max Nordau, Lady Henry Somerset and Miss Willard.
Since then, psychologists like Marro, Kaan and Beddoes
(in “Hygeia”); women doctors and teachers like Mrs,
Mary Allen and Mrs. Ennis Richmond ; specially-qualified
laymen such as J. Hudrey-Menos and Canon Lyttleton,
and an army of others, have agreed that in sexual matters
it is never “outspokenness” that does the damage, but
mystery- and arrested knowledge. It is this continual
uninstructed snuffling on the part of Australia’s “great
dailies ” at the impropriety of plain stage statements of
plain life facts (things that can’t do the least harm to the
youngest or oldest of us) that serves to ban some of the
best dramatic work that is being done’ nowadays from our
stage, and make the local theatres the prosperous hunting-
grounds of banal musical indecencies that they are. The
journal that classes “ Paid in Full ” as a work that is un-
fit for the youthful, and has no moral reproaches to level
at “The Merry Widow,” is capable of locking up the uld
Testament and putting Elinor Glynn’s “Three Weeks”
where the Aged Book used to repose.

“ By Wireless Telegraphy,” the new topi-
cal melodrama at the King’s (Melb.), is a long-
winded perversion of the current G'rippen case,
aggravated by comic relief. Crippen, in this
case, is disguised as Doctor I awley Hippon, an
inane disciple of Svengali, ana his lady-in-waiting
is one Ethel Lenore, who becomes hypnotised
whenever he looks at her, but is a rather quick
and lively Ethel when his baleful back is turned.
During these lucid intervals she reciprocates the
affection of a , music-hall “expert in wireless
telegraphy,” but every time they get engaged
to be married Hippon intervenes and biots
out her will-power. The colossal absurdity of
these three persons is outri vailed by a gloomy de-
tective, whose glaring eye is always searching for
clues. In the first place, the policeman rightly
suspects Hippon, the hypnotist, of intercepting
wireless messages re horse-racing, and converting
the precious information to his own base uses.
Apparently Hippon backs horses on the wire-
less tips, and lets a boozy young barrister
into the know, with the result that they
both go stony broke, whereupon Hippon has to
murder his wife —a music-hall lady in the
serio-chronic line—for her cash and jewellery.
From which time out he is a hunted Hippon, trying
to escape from the preposterous policeman and
the other expert in wireless. He takes the dreamy
Ethel around with him, and if he notices sparks
in the air he brings down the curtain on a futile
attempt to cut off the wireless at the meter.
Finally, Hippon and the young woman are tried
for murder at a melodrama criminal court, where
the feeling of the public is expressed by eight or
10 girls who stand in a pew and murmur
like sad sea waves on account of poor
Ethel. She manages to escape without a
stain on her character. Hippon, having
removed his hypnotic influence, gives her per-
mission to reveal her innocence, after which the
boozy barrister hands him a revolver as an “ex-
hibit,” and he shoots himself dead. The learned
Judge had previously lodged a protest against the
revolver, but his objection came too late. Any
way, Hippon knew enough about wireless teleg-
raphy to have committed ether suicide, if neoes-
sary, by clutching an electric wave and giving
himself a fatal shock. The moral of this modern
melodrama is : Never tamper with Marconi’s in-
vention for the purpose of backing gee-gees.
“By Wireless Telegraphy” might be a
productive atrocity if Bert Bailey and Temple
Harrison (whose individual and collective attempts
at comic-Jew impersonation are unspeakably
crude) were cut down to 50 lines apiece, and the
initial music-hall scene were supplied with four
good turns. Redgrave, Max Clifton, Beckett,
Miss Wilton, Miss Bryer and Miss Erris do very
well in their parts, whilst Geo. Cross, as the
criminal investigator, endeavors to present an
ominous appearance. There is variety in the
staging, and the action might be fairly rapid
throughout if the two misplaced funny men were
almost entirely withdrawn from the proceedings.

This is the fourth week of “ Tom Jones ”
at the Royal, and Melbourne has quite recovered
from its previous suspicions concerning the plot
of that clean and wholesome comedy opera. In
fact, the all-round respectability of the libretto
has been complained of by some people ; whose
recollections of Fielding’s novel are confined to
the spicy bits. Even Lady Bellaston has to be
strictly proper in the opera. Her intent ons may
be otherwise, but the rigid virtue of Jones refuses
to unbend, and her parting laugh is merely a
snort set to merriment.

At the Princess’s three creditable per-
formances of “Dorothy,” by the Arion Society
of Amateurs, have come and gone ; and just now
the theatre is closed. On Saturday a J. C.
Williamson combination, new to Melbourne, will
sound the loud timbrel of sheer frivolity in “A
Knight for a Day.” The advt. describes the
coming entertainment as “ farce extravaganza
with music” and “ the end-all of uproariousness.”
It seems to invite the impoverished victims of
Derby Day to roll up and drown their sorrow in a
rippling stream of inconsequentiality.
** * *
“The Whip,” at Her Majesty’s (Mel-
bourne), distils the spirit of these Cup Carni-
val times from every pore of its horsey
narrative. Now is the fifth week of the
drama’s spectacular career, and the hero who
narks Joe Kelly into laying him 20 to 1
in thousands—three times—about the dark horse
that won its trial by 20 lengths is a hero indeed.
The dead bird doesn’t win the race by 20 inches,
as it happens, but the victory is enough to swear
by, and the bookmaker, when last seen, appears
to be swearing horribly.

Les Marbas, who came into the Opera
House on Saturday, danced with much
agility and eccentric business, and appeared in
costumes that are certainly smart. The lady’s
frock is particularly chic, and suggests that she
doesn’t put all of her earnings on her back. As
regards other Rickardian performers, Judge
Kelly is still delivering his impartial judgments,
and Mrs. Yeamans-Titus is imitating people as
before. She would be better assisted, by the
way, if her husband had a grander piano to
finger. The one he uses at present might be sent
to a tinsmith for repairs.

Wirth’s Circus is now spreading a vast new
tent in Melbourne. The programme, supported
by the Frantz Family at one end and Raymond,
the gaol-breaker, at the other, has a tendency to sag
at its intermediate section. Its weakest spot is tlie
prolonged discourse of a clown. Its other weak-
nesses include somersaulting and hat-throwing
acts that were probably passi when Time wa«
beginning to teethe. However, the turn of
Miss Millie Daginar, who introduces a team if
trained dogs, is an antidote to dull care ; and
the agility of the Frantz Troupe compensates for
the weariness of a serpentine dance. Other
attractions include the Juggling Testros ; Marco,
the animal-tamer ; Miss May Martin, the trapezi-
enne; and Miss D. Cooke, the slack-wire per-
former ; but all these pale into insignificance
beside Lizzie, the hippopotamus. The multitude
that rushed the tent on Saturday night found a
Bullfinch mine of amazement in this star animal.
Lizzie, who is demure enough to be called Pris-
cilla, runs to short legs and extravagant mouth
development. Writer lias never seen the interior
of Lizzie’s mouth ; but, from all accounts, it is a
fearful sort of place by moonlight. On Cup night
the usual Wirthian custom of presenting a gold-
mounted whip to the winning jockey will be
observed with due solemnity.

Take four cyclones, a handful of fatuity,
and stir in a pound of dynamite, and you have
something resembling the spirit of “ Foolshead in
a Lion’s Cage,” which appeared on Saturday at
the Melbourne Glaciarium. As a comedian
Foolshead is far too demonstrative ; but, as com-
pared with Tweedledum in certain aeronautical
adventures, he is a prince of humor. “Pic-
turesque Subiaco” (Italy) can be righteously
praised as a beautiful picture beautifully tinted ;
but the story of “Her Father’s Pride,” a film
that deals with the influence of a dull hymn tune.

Saturday’s programme at Melbourne
Olympia contained “A Darling Confusion,”
which told the violent story of a lady carried
away by the force of her jealous passion. The
film is very neat and compact as comedy pictures
go, and is preferable to the yarn of “ A Family
l eud,’ whose plot would have been hoary to pre-
historic man. “Lieut. Rose and the Stolen Sub-
marine” is dramatic in a large, magnificent way ;
whilst “ The Italian Flying Artillery,” showing
the soldier men hauling guns up precipitous
slopes, is an education in the horsemanship and
mobility of the Dago army.

The widespread distraction of Melbourne
shows is to be distended on Saturday by a Maori
Village at the Exhibition Building, and the Besses
o’ the Barn Band at the M.C.C. Ground. Also,
an enormously Fat Gentleman, and a monkey who
professes to be almost human, are on view in the
city. What the monkey lacks in humanity is
more than counterbalanced by the surplus tonnage
of the Fat Man.

Carl Howard and Lily Foy, making their
first appearance at Adelaide Tivoli, are an un-
usual pair of fun-providers. Doubtless Howard
could mystify his audiences in the ordinary way,
but he finds it more profitable to make them
lswigh. So his tricks are either obviously absurd
“fakes,” or, just as one is getting really mysti-
fied, the machinery is turned inside out for public
inspection. Other more ambitious magicians
might find it profitable to form a Society for the
Abolition of Howard. The Gold Diggers Quartette
is at the Tivoli too, with Morris Cronin and his
übiquitous “party,” who multiply themselves in-
definitely and catch whirling clubs in their sleep.
At the Royal, “A Knight for a Day” has run a
short course successfully. The Williamson Co. has
all kinds of reserve strength. Miss Toby Claude,
the tiny American humorist, comes in for the
merely Mary Ann part, with W. S. Percy for a
neat match to her; and Miss Dorothy Bi unton
springs right to the front as a principal girl. The
picture shows are specialising a little, the Lyceum
having Arnst v. Barry, and West’s a film of the
A.J.C. Derby. Side-shows include an all-week
gathering of a “ Liberal ” ladies’ convention from
all Australia; a really fine repetition—for a
charity—of “The Golden Legend,” by the Uni-
versity choral class and Conservatorium orchestra;
and a commercial travellers’ wild and immensely
popular charity frivol at the Jubilee Oval.
The first shilling has arrived for the Wade
testimonial, and has been acknowledged at some
length in the Tory papers. The writer alleged
that she was a Scotch female body, aged 80 ; that
she had nine children ; and that Wade’s was the
best Government N.S.W. had ever possessed. A
shilling, by the way, was the exact amount which
another wild admirer once sent to the Sydney
Watchman as a contribution to a fund for the
destruction of the city of Rome, said to be in
process of collection by two great European lite-
rary men whose names, being translated, were
Yellowpup and Monkeyshave. A “ bob ” seems
to be regarded as a boundless guarantee of good
faith.
The gaol doors have opened, and P.
Bowling has emerged like the sun from behind a
cloud. His release was the first official act of the
McGowen Ministry. He is reported as saying
that he will now take up his work where he left
it off some nine months ago, though the exact
meaning of that statement, if Bowling really
made it, is not too easy to describe. He left off
in the middle of a strike, a fierce battle with the
Tory Government and a bitter protest against
the infamous Coercion Act. Now there is no
str.ke, no Tory Government and no prospect of a
continuance of the Coercion Act; so it will be
difficult to resume where he left off. And the
public will be very sorry if he does. It has hopes
that decent democratic legislation will make that
sort of resumption unnecessary.
The Perth (W.A.) police have dug nearly
a fathom down in the backyard of Alfred W.
Smart, and haven’t found Ethel Harris, though
they have discovered such a collection of woman’s
clothes that they reckon Ethel, if she left Perth
alive, must have started east with very little
on. Now the ground is getting rather hard,
and the ventilation in the mine is none
100 good, and the lode seems to have run
out; so the force has left to dig elsewhere,
and has found a bag of old fish and a cow’s
bones. It still sticks to the belief that Miss Harris
is dead ; if she isn’t, she is one of the most silent
young women on record. The official theory is that
Smart married (1) a girl in Victoria, suspected to
be still alive, but no details given ; (2) Ethel
Harris, who mysteriously vanished last March,
and who is supposed to be the owner of the Sun-
day hat and garments which were interred in the
back yard ; (3) Mary Pemberthy. As it is im-
possible to charge him with the brutal murder of
Ethel Harris’s Sunday hat, or the waylaying and
massacre of her corset, he is being held on spec
upon a charge of bigamy. Even supposing Ethel is
dead and buried, the prospects of the police look
only moderate. They can’t dig up the universe.
There are square miles of waste land around
Perth, and one mile looks much the same as
another. And it is seven months since the dis-
appearance, so the ground will have had time to
settle down and to grow a fair and gracious over-
coat of vegetables. Some day, perhaps, the
corpse-finder will become an institution like the
water-tinder—the person whose infallible hazel
twig insists on pointing at the alleged whisky
bottle on the shelf of the bush pub—and then
many mysteries will be cleared up, and many un-
claimed bank deposits will be collected by the
glad relatives.
GREY HAIR MAKES YOUR FACE
LOOK OLD.
A young face looks old if it is surrounded with
grey, faded or dead-looking hair. Allen’s
Mexican Walnut Stain will make from 10 to 20
years difference in your appearance if you are
grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly harm-
less, and easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth or younger
years.
Allen’s Mexican Walnut Stain is not to be
confounded with the common or garden “hair
restorers,” which deceive nobody but the deluded
users. This unique preparation is offered as a
superior stain, and its composition has been
arrived at only after a long series of experiments.
No injurious effect will be produced, provided the
simple directions are followed out —it is quite free
from Lead, Mercury or Sulphur. It is equally
suitable for ladies’ hair or hair of the beard or
moustache, aqd will not wash off or stain the linen.

“0.K.”: The dariseuse engaged by Clarke and Meynell
in place of Essie Perrin has a name which suggests a dis-
tinctly un-English art of movement. For which novelty
many thanks ! The dancers that we hav e admired of
late—Fanny Dango, light and dainty in her English style ;
Essie Perrin, heavier, but equally elegant in hers, and
various Australian girls of the Williamsonian school—
were none of them remarkable adepts in the airs and
graces of “foreign” artists. If the new lady, Chiestie
Molniah, is as foreign as her name, her methods may be
expected to prove valuable object-lessons to Australian
talent.
Amalfy, who appears in the second act of “Our Miss
Gibbs,” is, of course, Imre Kiralfy, probably the greatest
producer of shows on amammoth scale since Nero and the
palmy days of the Roman Coliseum. Kiralfy is a Hun-
garian and is 65 years of age. He started life as a dancer,
and is said to have been helped in his earlier years by the
Emperor Maximilian. When he was 23 he entered on the
spectacular show business in Brussels with a pageant that
employed over 4000 soldiers. Later he went to America, and
during the 25 years he putin there showed the inhabitants
some impressive spectacles. His “ Fall of Babylon ” and
“ Nero” are circumstances to lock away in the lavender of
one’s memory. He and Barnum for a time ran shows at the
Olympia, London. This place, Earl’s Court and Shep-
herd’s Bush have been the scenes of Kiralfy’s London
triumphs, which date from the year ’95.
“ Hen ” : If the Perth (W. A.) mystery had happened in
England 40 years ago it would have been a godsend to
the music-halls. In those days gruesome current epi-
sodes were treated lightly and airily by the variety per-
son ; as, for instance, when the British hangman died
suddenly, and his alleged spectre immediately started to
appear in nigger minstrelsy with a song and dance, the
former beginning :
I am the ghost of John James Christopher .Benjamin
Bin i is,
I was cut off right in the midst of my sins.
Probably the song about Miss Harris and the disturbed
backyard at Perth would havecommenced something like
this :
They are digging in the yard in search of Ethel.
She doesn’t sing these days in Little Bethel.
“ Bethel” is one of the very few words which rhyme with
“ Ethel,” and it would have been rung in even if there
wasn’t the slightest evidence that the lady could sing
or had ever attended Bethel in her life.
“ 10-2-4 ” : I see Miss Mab Paul, the strong woman of
the Criterion, knocked out a suspected footpad the
other night. The enemy fell upon her from the shadows
and gripped her arm, whereat she passed him the slum-
ber stroke. In my view, the betting- is even money’ that
her victim was an inoffensive homing drunk, who tripped
over his own beer-entangled feet, and grabbed her under
the delusion that she was a passing lamp post.
I remember a large and powerful naval lad, who sat in a
Macquarie-street club one da.v listening to the recital of a
fearsome affair that had occurred in the Appian
Way a few nights previously’. “The scoundrel
slunk up to me,” said the narrator, “and asked
the time. I was ass enough to produce my watch.
When I came to, the watch was gone; so was
he, and all I got in exchangee was an injured jaw, a
slight concussion of the brain and a fresh instalment of
experience.” The naval man, being of a taciturn dis-
position, only sat and brooded. Time passed and there
came a night when he too was in the Appian Way at a
late hour. The expected happened. Suddenly out of
the darkness loomed a stranger. In the deceptively mild
tone of the typical skulking desperado the' apparition
said: “Could you oblige me with a match, sir?”
The mariner answered not, but swung a swift right
and a terrific left, and the malefactor lay torpid
on the roadway. With a grateful sensation warm-
ing his heart that England, that night, had done
the right thing, the honest salt went to his float-
ing home and a well-earned night’s rest. Next day he
learned that his victim was one of the most innocuous
medical men in College-street.

“Shifter”: The gentleman who aviates as “Mr.
Jones” and acts as Robert Loraine, and who is to wed
the Australian-born Marie Lohr, took to the stage in
1889. His father, Henry Loraine, was a fairly well-
known mime in his time. Robert himself has played at
Drury Lane, and under Alexander at the St. James’s. He
dropped the hare’s-foot for the sword in 1899, and went to
the Boer war as a volunteer ; but bloodshed palled, or
grease-paint called, or something, and he started in 1901
on a successful theatrical season in the U. States. His
roles include Henry V., D’Artagnan, The Idler, and
Garrick in “Pretty Peggy,” the last an “18th century
costume ” piece that Nellie Stewart did at the defunct
Lyceum some years ago.
The elocution contests at the recent annual outbreak
in Ballarat were judged by C. H. Baeyertz, editor of the
M.L. Triad. About 1000 spouters came along for judg-
ment during the three weeks, and Baeyertz, who is a
most entertaining raconteur and versatile mimic, had to
tick off their pretensions. The irony of his position must
have entered into the very soul of Judge Baeyertz. It
was he who should have been on the platform, whilst the
1000 reciters were getting ideas from the entertainment.
The anniversary of “The Whip” at Drury Lane,
London, last month, was to have been signalised by the
appearance of several real jockeys in the race scene ; but
they all got stage fright at the last moment. “The
Whip ” had not really run for a year, as it was taken off
for a while to make room for pantomime. The only other
plays in London surviving from 1909 were “ The Bad Girl
of the Family,” “ The Importance of Being Earnest ”
(which was revived in September a year ago, and has
made a quite unexpected success), and three musical
comedies, “The Dollar Princess,” “The Arcadians,” and
“ Our Miss Gibbs,” all of which are far into their second
year, and show no sign of stopping.

The “Australia at Work” cinematograph show is
travelling around Victoria, educating the little towns up
to a knowledge of the importance of Australian manu-
facturing industries. The amount of labor employed in
a large biscuit or lolly factory is a revelation even to
the average metropolitan citizen. To the bucolic folk
the pictures on the screen give an entirely new idea of
what a Labor movement in politics really means.
Workers at work make an impressive show, but the audi-
ence’s “ O-o-h ” of wonderment is loudest when the fac-
tories disgorge their human contents at 5 o’clock.
The outrush of hundreds of employees almost per-
suades a hoary hayseed Tory that Protection makes
for progress. Previously, when he came to Melbourne
for the Agricultural Show or Cup, he looked at the
crowds and wondered how all these people lived. “Aus-
tralia at Work ” films teach him how a lot of people live,
and how a lot more are going to do likewise.
“Harrison O.” : More classes of humans —“ Bloggs ”
(l/9/’10) notwithstanding—yearn to be known by abbrevi-
ated forms of their first names than Australian black-and-
white artists, British Labor members and low comedians.
F’rinstance, bookmakers (Sol Green, Joe Thompson, Sol
Joel) and pugilists (Bill Lang, Jack Johnson, Bill Squires,
Tommy Burns, and about 29 or 278,635 others). Also,
hair carpenters and the proprietors of drink foundries
often pi ice a pet name over the door and invite the
public to know them by it. The method of abbreviating
the first name of a person so as to win for him the public
affection has long been practised by bellowdramatists.
Thus the characters whom we are supposed to respect
and love are familiarly labelled Jack Bathurst or Tom
Brandon, or something of the sort; while those whom
the dramatist desires us to dislike are given their full
names, so that when the heroine wishes to spurn the base
proposals of the villain, she cries : “ Leave this room, Sir
Francis Studleigh ! ” or “ No, Captain Guy Levisou—do
your worst!” So there is a certain amount of method
in the apparent lunacy.
“ Back Pew” : Calvb’s collapse on the stage at Welling-
ton (M.L.) Opera House was more serious than the audi-
ence knew, and she took big risks in going on with the
programme. Before the concert she had complained of
feeling unwell ; but when she went on she appeared
to be right enough, though more reserved than usual.
After the first few notes of her opening solo, “ The
Mysoli,” she reeled and caught a chair to prevent herself
falling. Amongst the guests at the back of the stage was
a nurse, and in front was the ship’s doctor of the Tonga-
riro. Both hurried from their places, and when Calvb
was laid out on a couch in the wings, they massaged
her and administered restoratives. They warned and
argued ; but nothing would induce Calvb to retire from
the programme—the public first, herself second, she
said. So she went on and sang each number, while the
doctor and the nurse waited in the wings like seconds at
a fight, and considered the advisability of calling up the
police to arrest her for assault on her physical powers.
“0.K.”: An Irish Pipers’ Band is the latest of Vic-
torian musical products, and if it has no other result
than to expose the hollowness of Scottish pipers’ pre-
tensions, the new band will deserve toleration. An Irish
reed-wind instrument, properly played, yields melody
which the blithering old Macphairson bagpipe is
utterly incapable of. Some years ago Rickards im-
ported a breezy Irish comedian whose speciality was
piping. His performance was weirdly charming—in
moderation. No Hielander was ever fit to blow his
unmanageable national instrument on the same plat-
form with the Celt whom Rickards introduced. If
there are many like him in the Melbourne band of 20
Micks, they will get all the Australian forbearance which
hitherto has been foolishly extended to the swaggering
fiends in tartan.
Before the elections (October 6) :
Mr. McGowen ... by his openly-avowed sympathy with
defiant, contemptuous law-breakers, is undermining 1 that
respect for law and order which is absolutely necessary
to the continuance of a democracy, and asserting the
pernicious doctrine that a member of Parliament, sworn
to uphold the law, is entitled to become a partisan of
faction and lawless violence.
And after (October 22): —
Mr. McGowen’s straightforwardness and honesty of
purpose is unquestioned.
Both are from the Sydney Daily Telegraph—
the paper which filled the air with its agonised
screams about the Labor party’s “Campaign of
Calumny ” regarding dear Mr. Wade.

The Glebe, in lifting Keegan to the top,
Has spurned our slickest cueist, weight for age.

And yet the victor’s bays are not for him !

But that Glebe’s bitter loss may be the gain

Vic. Artists’ Society’s Exhibition.
Held for the first time at the Athenaeum, instead
of at the Gallery on Eastern Hill, the meeting of
pictures by the V.A.S. is comparatively free
from rubbish. The hall is not very large, and
one end of it is devoted to a shipment of pictures
by Australian artists abroad; consequently a
number of arrant impostors and feeble per-
formers were refused admission for want
of space. About 140 works are hanging
around, the conspicuously absent exhibitors
being Bernard Hall and Blamire Young,
who lately ran their own shows. Seeing that
Bernard Hall is an instructor of National Gallery
students, he should have had at least one picture
in this fairly representative gathering. One of
his characteristic back-view studies of female
beauty unadorned is badly needed here, for the
women in this collection are mostly studies of pose
in clothes, and the scarcity of convincing flesh
tints would have given to one of Hall’s complete
nudes an air of natural distinction.
Ered McCubbin, to be sure, has some small
modern nymphs in his “Summer Idyll,” but they
are mere items of active humanity amidst peace-
ful sylvan surroundings. Beneath the arching
boughs of glorified ti-trees some of the diminutive
young women are seated on the verdure whilst
others dance ring-a-rosy. The composition sug-
gests the Land of Watteau rather than the Land
of the Wattle. Of the pictures McCubbin has
made since he broke away from his original Aus-
tralian style, this is the best, perhaps. An ambi-
tious attempt by Norah Gurdon is “Heirlooms”
(23), worth mentioning because it is one of those
“parlor-comedy” pictures in which the actors
have no facial expression to speak of. There is some
promising effort in “Heirlooms.” The stage
management is good, yet the picture as a whole is
worthless because the work has ceased where the
most difficult part should have commenced. The
biggest and best examples of abbreviated art in
figure-painting are by young Charles Wheeler.
His draughtmanship is strong and versatile
(though the meagre arms of the one girl in “The
Butterfly ’’ seem stiff and flat), his sense of
color is liberal, and he composes his pictures
gracefully. But in both of them—the larger is
“ A Boem,” with three women in it—he dodges
the difficulty of putting realism into the faces.
He has one gigantic picture containing nothing
that couldn’t have been more charmingly ex-
pressed on an eighth of the canvas. And
Wheeler prices it at £250 on the strength of its
dimensions ! He is a gifted artist, and will grow
out of his prematurely large opinion of himself.
Hans Heysen’s landscapes—notably “In Sunset
Haze ” (water-color) —are a pleasure to the eye ; as
likewise is Ford Paterson’s “ AGippslaud Lake,”
in which the veteran artist is quite himself again.
Ambrose Patterson is represented by his con-
vincing full-length portrait of his father
(51) —done in a way that is partly impres-
sionistic yet wholly satisfactory—and by a bright
ill-drawn view of a Brussels boulevard, which
is a much more effective achievement than
Hal Waugh’s “A Wet Day in Flinders Street”
(92). Waugli can treat such scenes artistically ;
but in this case the color scheme is at fault, and
though he may be said to have caught the tramear,
he certainly has missed the’bus. Walter Withers
and Mather show saleable little landscapes in
water-color ; Christina Baker has two meritorious
portraits (one in pastels); and Leslie Wilkie’s
studies of human nature are passable only in com-
parison with some that are worse. Among the
larger landscapes a bad one by Nicholls Anderson
is specially remarkable for the price—£l2o—
he puts on it. (The price is even more
appalling than the perspective of “ The Road
to Killara,” for there are other pictures with
perspectives almost as bad.) In a class by itself is
George Dancy’s “Summer Roses” (31), some-
what saccharinely poetical, but good m drawing
and harmoniously decorative in treatment. The
highly ornate frame fits the pictorial design.
The framing is a special addition to the pictures
sent by Australians abroad. The up-to-date en-
vironment of a modern picture is seemingly as
old and elaboiately trimmed and dingily gilt as
the artist can get it. Thirty years ago Art
mocked at these old-fashioned frames. They
were said to kill the picture ; they were bourgeois
atrocities; they were relics of an age when Art
was asleep, and so forth. The hardened Philis-
tine of to-day smiles at this revival of bygone
barbarism, and wonders how Art can possibly
reconcile its new craze with its old doctrine.
Fullwood’s “ London from Hampstead Heath ”
is so low-toned that it might as well be a wash-
drawing in grey and white. Tom Roberts’s “ April
Girl,” thinly painted in oils, has a water-color
effect. The lady’s eyes are beautiful. Long-
si affs portrait of a brown-haired charmer is rather
indecisive about the head, and decidedly careless
in the;. figure. “Motherhood,” by Phillips
Fox (80), is an outdoor portrait group of
a graceful, undistinguished-looking mother in
white, nursing a baby, also in white, whilst a
growing girleen says “Goo-goo” to the infant.
The artist’s pet device of sun spots on the light
fabrics and ground is again introduced. Baby has
a doll-like patch of red on the cheek, and the
girleen’s face is merely an apology. It is a pretty,
glaring picture of somewhat unreal creatures in a
pea-green world. Max Meldrum has a dark brown
study of a rugged old man, Re mbrandtesque in de-
sign, but hardly Rembrandtian in result, Streeton
has sent a small, festive sea-coast scene. George
Lambert’s hard, odd picture, “The Shop,” is not
nearly as interesting as his “old-masterly” por-
traits lately exhibited in Melbourne; and Rupert
Bunny’s “Burial of St. Catherine” is disap-
pointing. It is a decorative work in misty grey
and pink tones, hardly more striking than an old
tapestry story, but calculated to improve on
acquaintance. Which is more than can be said for
Fred Leist’s clever freak picture, “Early Edition.”
The girl’s brief dress is real satin, but the Early
Victorian fashion of her outfit is ugly; nor is she
herself anything of a peach. Very sweet and
breezy, in an orthodox colored-supplement man-
ner, is James Quinn’s “ The Squire’s Daughter ”
—as though there were any “ squires ” nowadays,
outside of melodrama !
Take them altogether, the imported pictures are
not a truly delightful collection, but they are
good stuff, and they should remind the public
that the experienced absentee painters were, with
one or two exceptions, greatly underrated in their
young Australian time.
Already the Only True Laborite has begun
to write to the Tory press complaining because
the N.S.W. Labor Ministry isn’t composed
wholly of manual toilers, and declaring that the
party is betrayed, and that a great split is
imminent. Everybody knows that Only Genuine
Laborite. The occasion when he was fined £lO
for furious driving of his motor-car is still fresh
in the public memory.

THE SODDEN ONE: “I knew (hie) those shossiges
weren't dead—I can hear the (hie) brutes
barking.”
At the inquest on two men killed by the
collapse of a crane at Pyrmont (Sydney) last
week it was shown that the whole weight of the
crane rested on one bolt. It was an old crane,
and apparently the bolt was old too ; and when it
gave way, the whole affair fell. According to the
dailies, the coroner said, “It seemed strange to
him that the whole safety of the crane should
depend upon one bolt.” And he was right. In
fact, it is more than strange. It is diabolical,
and should be rewarded with something cold and
hard. But though the coroner thought the single
bolt idea was “strange,” he found a verdict of
accidental death ! If other things were con-
structed on the same crack-brained principle,
what a holocaust there would be ! Imagine a
tramcar in which the snapping of one bolt or bar
meant death to everyone on board. How long
would that car be allowed to run once the fact was
known ? And if it is not good for a crowd, it is
not good for one or two men who have to work
the thing.
“Itan”: Austra-
lia is gradually being
discovered, and,
although quite a
number of people
have been at the
business for cen-
turies, there is still
room for the ven-
turesome. In Cook’s
time, the country
was discovered to
be sterile, unproduc-
tive, and fit only for
a penal settlement.
Later on, Fat col-
lected great areas,
and discovered that
they were no good
for anything but
sheep and cattle.
Still later, the not-
so-Fat began making
investigations, with
numerous surprising
results. Victoria has
found that theMallee
is a rich grain-
grower ; South Aus.
is doing the same at
Pinnaroo; and N.S.
Wales unearthed the
Pilliga. Until a few
years ago all these
millions of acres
were said by Fat to
be valueless for sup-
porting white Aus-
tralians all they
would grow was
sheep, and only one
of them to several
square miles. Fat
talked through his
pocket, as usual.
Another recent dis-
covery is the great
rich Barkly Table-
land iii the Northern Territory ; another, that
the spinifex tracts of Westraiia are very pro-
mising wheat and fruit producers. Then there
are the discoveries made in Artesia, and many
others. It wouldn’t he surprising to hear before
long of the discovery that there is no desert at all
in Australia, and that what looked like wilderness
was only rich land crying to be handled some
other way.

The next important experiment in connec-
tion with Maoriland’s liquor traffic will probably
be in the direction of State control. A significant
hint is given in the Lyttelton Times (G/10/’lo)— a
paper which has for years stood valorously by No
License. Discussing the periodical shindy on the
question of how to be sober although residing in
a No License district, the Times says :
Even our prohibition friends do not need to be re-
minded that these evils [as detailed by police inspectors
recently] and other evils that accompany the liquor
traffic might be eliminated by the adoption of State
control. If the element of private profit were removed
from the traffic, almost every abuse to which the inspec-
tors drew attention would disappear, and theprohibition-
ists and the moderates would be able to turn from their
eternal squabbles over the licensing question, and unite
with a common goodwill in promoting the best political
interests of the country.
All of which is possible if the great army of
moderate drinkers would take a more active and
intelligent part in the proceedings. Sitting on the
chest of the grog merchant whilean opponent pulls
his house down is all right as a warning, but it is
a mistake as a habit. In time the entire supply
of house will give out, and the last pewter will be
melted down for Band of Hope medals. Then
the moderate drinker will suddenly ask for a long
sleever. and will be given a gingerheer, and the
Man Who Didn’t Hear the Alarm Bell will kick
himself dejectedly.

The long-winded legal indictment received
another fusillade of contumely at Hobart a few
days ago. One Higgins was charged with per-
jury, although, when the indictment had been
read, the charge might have been one of tarring
and feathering the criminal code for all the jury
could make out. -‘I Suppose,” said the. Chief
Justice to counsel for the defence, “your client
understands all that?’’ “Yes, your Honor,”
was the answ’er. For a moment it appeared as if
the Judge would, in his admiration for so much
intelligence, step down and shake hands with the
accused. But he didn’t. Perhaps he thought
better of it; perhaps he was paralysed. He con-
tented himself with making remarks about the
indictment calculated to make the animal go and
get its hair cut.

sion to Te Aroha. A special train will leave 'Kai angahake
at 9 a.m., returning from Te Aroha at 6.30 p.m. Excur-
sion rates. Carriages reserved for ladies and children ox
return journey. Town band in attendance.
Apparently, on the way home, the drunks are
heaved into cattle trucks or tied on behind.
THE INEXPLICABLE.
HE (after making a hash of it): “ N-no! Let
me explain myself !”
SHE: “Oh , that's impossible!”
“D.”: A parson told the Congregational
Union last week that he was standing on the
back of a tram when a man shouted out “ Hullo,
wowser!” “It seems to me,” said the nar-
rator, “that there is a tremendous outbreak
of irreverence in these days. I don’t know
how much there is behind it, but there is
the irreverence that we have to contend with.”
What a priceless example it is of the cleric’s
stupendous vanity ! The writer, in common
with most other citizens, has endured the indig-
nity of being “chyacked” on trams and
elsewhere. He is not a preacher or Social
Evil remover or anti-beer expert;
withal he considers his method
of beltin'? out a living as honorable
as that of Judkins, Dill Macky or
any other strife-creator. And yet
he would not accuse the wayside
drunk or larrikin of “irreverence”
because the latter found him
strange-looking and jeered as he
passed by. Nor, I warrant, would
the newspapers ascribe the occur-
rence to irreligion if they got
wind of it. In my view, whole
hordes of indigenous parsons are
suffering acutely from swelled
head. They are so used to being
grovelled to by Sewing Bees,
Wirnmen’s Leagues, Dorcas So-
cieties and Guilds for the Preven-
tion of Unclothedness in Central
Africa that an occasional bump
against one of Life’s cold, crude
Facts leaves them frantic with
annoyance, and under a firm
conviction that in their person
the Deity has been flouted.
Charity begins at home,
and ends at the golf links. Any-
how, that is how the tearful and
indignant young lady put it to
the Sydney pressman. “ You
know,” she explained, “I thought I
was going to have the record box
collection of Charity Saturday when
they included the Royal Golf Links
in my round, and instead of that I
just wasted my time going there. Two
of us were selected, because we had
done well in the morning, and because—
oh, because we are nice, I suppose. And
—and—oh, I could have sat down and
howled ! We trudged all round and round
and begged, and they either merely looked
us up arid down, or said ‘’Pon honor, I
haven’t any change.’ Only one of all those
wealthy people gave me a subscription. And
what do you think it was? A penny! One
solitary, niingy penny!” The pressman" opined
that it was enough to bring on a revolu-
tion. “ Revolution ! ” exclaimed the disap-
pointed one. “I could have boxed their
ears ! ”
The Church is doubtless sincere, but sin-
ful people often wish it would sell some of its
sincerity and buy grammar and accuracy with the
money. Witness, for instance, this motion sub-
mitted by Parson Buchan to the Congregational
Union (Sydney) last week :
That this Assembly very deeply regrets the result of the
vote for No License, feels assured that the community
had not fully realised its responsibility and opportunity,
but that with further education and longer time the de-
cision will be completely reversed, enters its serious pro-
test against the continuance of the conditions under
which elections are conducted, seeing that while hotels
are closed other places are arranged for, where people are
treated with free drinks all day, and vehicles of all de-
scription are used to an extent that is greatly to be
deplored, and resolves to do all in its power to have con-
ditions amended at the earliest date, and to take all
lawful means to secure the vote of the people on the side
of No License.
One hundred and twenty-six words all in one sen-
tence ! And in that single remark Parson Buchan
compresses two amazing statements : (1) That
there were free drinks to be had all through
polling day if only the dry, perishing drunks who
were barking in stray corners had known it; and
(2) that “ vehicles of all descriptions” (including,
doubtless, sampans, chariots, pantechnicons, trac-
tion engines, jaunting cars, house-boats, rickshaws,
sledges, aeroplanes, balloons and sedan-chairs)
were rushing about in a deplorable fashion. Were
they real, or were they only wheeled fantods
caused by the free drinks ?

Tasmania’s Attorney-General, Solomon,
head of the Crown Law Department, which sud-
denly dropped the prosecution against the keeper
of a notorious Launceston Flossie house and sly-
groggery, despite the prima facie evidence of the
police, took the chair at Bro. Judkins’s morality
rally at the same village recently. The Hobart
Daily Post, dealing with the case of Flo,
remarked :
In order that the public should remain in ignorance as
to the character of a certain witness the Attorney-
General stopped the prosecution, and with frigid effron-
tery explained that ‘‘ The verdict in the Langmaid case
was the subject of a lot of anonymous correspondence,”
and if the brothel case were gone on with “ it would only
have the effect of stirring up more correspondence on the
same matter.
And while Jud. was cracking the welkin concern-
ing the evil of illicit liquor and the awful sin of
vending the charms of Flossie, Solomon sat with
the air of one who had never heard of the lady.
He didn’t even put his tongue in his cheek—pos-
sibly for fear of damaging his tongue.
A wife-beating case, heard in Melbourne
the other day, produced some quaint evidence.
The battered lady, with one eye in a bundle, her
ear threaded on, and an arm in a sling, described the
“whipping” she had received. Asked howshecame
to marry the brute, complainant explained: “I was
a nurse. He had a fever. I nursed him back to
life, and he was so grateful that he married me.”
Accused had the bad luck not to meet the usual
Bench of honorariums, and received five weeks for
overdoing his marks of gratitude.
THE SIMPLE FAITH HE WAS PROUD OF.
H ER: “ You ought to be ashamed to be always
in debt.”
HIM: “I would be if I weren't so proud that 1
can always get credit.”
THE INFERIOR HALO..
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Saint came back from the Halls of Grace
One midnight dark when the winds were still ;
Larsre tear-drops lay on his furrowed face ;
Unkempt looked he, and extremely ill.
He knocked but once on the Vicar’s door ;
The thing swung back from his ghostly hand ;
And, home from the grave, he paced once more
The hall where tottered the old hall-stand.
Into the library strode the Shade ;
The Vicar rose from his open book.
(Though ghosts were part of his holy trade.
There in his slippers he stood and shod;.)
“ Why have you risen from out the grave?”
The living moaned to the tearful dead ;
“ It isn’t a nice way to behave !
We put no stone on your reverend head !”
“ Well pleased am I with my earthen bed '
The Ghost replied, with a gusty sigh.
“I would I could slumber there instead
Of harping up in the draughty sky !
“ I pluck and I strum while Peter frowns,
And growls of ‘cheap, inferior kits’;
My halo should be of good half-crowns—.
'Tis made, alas ! of threepenny bits ! ”
The Vicar shrieked in a frightful way,
And, fainting, fell in his great armchair ;
“ Large silver /” was all that he could say
When the Curate found him crouching there.
And that is why all the parsons groan,
And shovers of plates give looks of hate,
When from your pocket you fork a lone
Threepence and plank it upon the plate.
Pity the clergyman’s ups and downs !
Even in Heaven it gets him fits,
When halos should be of good half-crowns,
To wear one made of threepenny-bits.

This Guinea Two=Piece
Crash Suit for Coolness !
IN spite of its moderate cost, we know of no suit that will
give more Summer satisfaction to one who spends much
time out of doors than this Guinea Crash Suit. The
material has a buff ground—a color that will not soil with the
first speck of dust—relieved by either faint blue, green or white
stripes. The material is shrunken before being made up ; first-
class workmanship being used in the coat and trousers. Hence
the suit will retain its good shape for longer than low-priced,
hot-day suits, that have not workmanship built into them.
In ordering this suit from the country, just give us your
waist and chest measurement and length inside leg—we'll be
able to exactly fit you. Add Is. extra to co.ver postage.
Please state stripe required.

“ The Religious Editor ” : I noticed some
striking headlines in my morning paper yester-
day. They were: “Visiting Prelates —The
Devil Not a Bad Fellow.” Glowing with enthu-
siasm at having at last discovered a generous
bishop who was willing to give the Devil his due,
I read the paragraph, and found that the Bishop
of Wangaratta had merely warned a congrega-
tion that the Devil never went out hunting now
in the old roaring-lion fashion, but disguised him-
self in modern garments, rammed his hoofs into
patent-leather boots and shouted for all hands.
It was an indirect way of saying that the Devil
doesn’t play the game. These parsons will never
give the opposition firm credit for anything ; and
yet the alleged existence of Nicholas and Co. is
the only excuse the Church has for continuing to
knock people over with its collection-plate, and
bother them with its endless rows about vest-
ments and candles. Imagine the consternation
there would be amongst the saints if the evening
papers rushed out with the shocking intelligence
that the Devil was dead, and that Sheol was to
be converted into a theatre for moving pictures,
with a band-stand in front and an American bar
right opposite the Gates ! I hope the Church
has insured the Devil’s life for a large sum ; if it
hasn’t taken that ordinary precaution against
disaster, it is a remarkably short-sighted institu-
tion, and its views on the next world are not
worth the usual thrippence.
N.S.W. Labor-leader McGowen will never
know how close a call he had at the election in
Redfern the other day. The Syrian has come
down on McGowen’s fold like the animal the poet
mentioned ; and ope of the tribe pours out his
soul in a letter to the local paper :
For how I disappoint for the election to be humble
servant for the Redfern when I took my nomination there,
the returning officer said too late. Surely he ought to
have given me few minutes’ grace. I faithfully pro-
mised the public six months ago I would be coming out
for the Redfern to be humble servant to do my duty for
the public. I had an idea and opinion for the Mother
Country what no other member ever suggested. I myself
am a Britisher. I am 33 years in the country. I call
myself a three-quarter native of it when I am taking in-
terest for the Mother Country in all Australasia. I be
fbur-quarter native and never call myself a foreigner.
My nomination was never granted and is a great loss to
me and my word never became faithful to the public of
Redfern. Thank God, I have the knowledge and experi-
ence to speak on any platform with regard to politics and
be afraid of no man.
(Signed) Humble Labour servant for Redfern,
S. AMIEN disgusted.
Heaven only knows what McGowen would be
doing now for a living if it hadn’t been for Asia’s
habit of being a few minutes late for the ’bus. In
fact. Heaven only knows what a lot of us would
be doing but for that habit of Asia’s.
“W.C.M.” expects something to happen :
Recently I travelled with some fat sheep to Sydney
from Hay, and, during the 40-odd hours I spent in the
guard’s van, I had time to notice a few' points about the
way Johnson’s Department runs the goods trains. On a
great number of the trucks there were only the old chain
couplings, instead of the later screw couplings, in spite
of the steep grades that have to be negotiated. At Junee
Junction it is the rule to make the train a double-header,
putting on an engine behind to help shove the vehicles
up to Bethungra ; and it is also the custom to make pas-
sengers by the goods trains—stockmen and others—
sign the “death warrant,” a paper relieving the Govern,
ment from liability in case the engine pushes through
the matchboard hack of the van. The train was some
300 tons as far as Goulburn, and there it was made up to
540 tons, and drawn by one engine. Some night this
500 odd tons, thundering down from Moss Vale, will
spread some rails, and then it won’t be healthy to be in
the mail train that follows. In Victoria the struggle for
cheapness is the main curse ; in N.S.W. it is the fool
policy of dragging everything to Sydney and through
the bottle neck at Redfern. And that is the cause, too,
of the infernal slowness of stock and goods trains. Here
are some of the times Left Hay, 9 a.m., Tuesday ; Nar-
randera (150 odd miles), 4.40 p.m. ; Junee, 9.10 p.m. ;
Cootamundra (60 miles further), 12.20 p.m. ; Harden,
4 a.m., Wednesday ; Yass, 9.15a.m. ; Goulburn, 1.30p.m. ;
Moss Vale, 6 p.m. ; Flemington (87 miles), 2.30 a.m.,
Thursday. That was 41J hours to do a total of 460 miles.
The duplication of the line may make things a trifle
better; but there will never be full relief until the insane
policy of dragging everything to Sydney is abolished.
NO PLACE FOB THE DOCTOR.
THE MAID: "Madam, the doctor."
THE LADY (whose gentleman friend is already waiting in the parlor): "Oh, Jane, its im-
possible to see him now. Say I'm ill."
Bananaland heaved a great sigh of relief
when the Prosbyterian Assembly of Australia,
sitting in Sydney, discovered that the northern
State is no more immoral than Victoria or South
Aus. The palm for defective morals was awarded
to Tasmania, where the big, idle landlord and the
sweater reign ; the reports concerning that State
were so bad that the official reading thereof had
to be postponed “ to allow an opportunity to hear
them read in private.” These divines always re-
serve the titbits for their private delectation.
“JUMP IN, MADAM!”
“ K.”: Shouldn’t there be a fresh election
for the Riverina seat ? How about this barefaced
sort of business? I quote from the Age of
October 8:
Tocumwal, Friday.—Mr. Peters, the Labor candidate
for Riverina, addressed a well-filled, representative audi-
ence last night. ... A vote of confidence in the candi-
date was passed.
I should think so.
Hori and Timi and Pin have been the
backbone of the shearing sheds in Poverty Bay
district (M.L.) of late years. They are cheap,
and that suits the wool-growers like fish suits a
cat. The work only lasts two or three months,
and that is kapai for the Maori, who can get
back “on the mat” and boast of his tallies to ad-
miring wahines. There is no award in the dis-
trict, but the union sec. has had a korero with the
brown men, and this season they are refusing to
touch the sheep’s clothing under £1 a hundred
and found. And the sheep’s proprietors lift their
hands to Heaven, and wonder what the world is
coming to.

“ Poneke Maoriland is just now overrun
by sky-pilots worse than ever. Dr. Henry and his
friend Potts are winding up a long season,
the London Missionary Society has
two “stars ” roaming the Dominion,
and canons and prebendaries and
small fry are bombarding the
country disguised as a “Mission
of Help’’—which I think is a
misprint for “Yelp.” Some
of the people in that strange
ricketty land got the idea
recently that they were
abnormally wicked, and
imported missioners from
far and near. The Mis-
sioned of Yelp have
been giving dinner-time
sermons to business men
in Wellington. The first
one was on the subject of
Pharaoh’s Dream. There
was no observable improve-
ment in the quality of the
sugar next day, and the
same old 15oz. went to the lb.
Dr. Henry, the Yankee pilot, is
thoroughly impressed with the ini-
quity of the Dominion. He told the
Waihi people they had not the courage of
a Chinaman —were, in fact, “spiritual skunks.”
He would not change places with them for the
Waihi mine itself. In fact, when he thought
about them his brain was in a whirl. Maoriland
is at present making a law to prohibit beer. A
clause to also prohibit missioners whose brains are
in a whirl is to be proposed when the Bill gets
into Committee.
The hobble skirt hasn’t yet appeared as
Exhibit A in a morgue case ; but that’s pure luck.
It only just missed the other afternoon. The
wearer got one foot on the pontoon when the boat
gave a wriggle and backed out. And there she
was, as unable to render first aid to herself as the
most securely trussed mummy in Egypt. Of
course she fell —she couldn’t do anything else.
But a wliarf-hand, apparently of the coal-lumping
profession, got to work and hoisted her out.
Then, as she panted and dripped, Coaly looked at
her and congratulated her thuswise: “ Marm,
you thank Gawd fur two things. First, you ain’t
crushed ’tween the boat an’ the piles. Second,
that you ain’t my missus.”
One A. W. Schapira broke into a news-
paper correspondence last week with a story that
amounted to a melodrama in itself. He wrote
under an intolerable sense of wrong. Twenty-
seven years ago a Jerusalem bookseller named
Shapira learned to imitate the handwriting of
Moses, and forged the original MSS. of the Book
of Deuteronomy. He priced the volume at a
million sterling, and gave it a prominent place in
his shop window. Within a year, and before a
sale had been effected, an officious handwriting
expert chanced along, detected discrepancies and
denounced Shapira’s property as bogus. The
value of the book slumped ; and “in the humilia-
tion of his pride,” as Schapira hath it, Shapira
committed suicide. Schapira’s trouble is that, by
the erudite inhabitants of Longueville (N.S.W.),
where he pursues his calling of ordained minister
of the Church of England, lie is constantly being
taken for Shapira. Saith he :
It is true that I was at that time residing in Palestine ;
but if those who are so ready and willing to believe evil
reports had taken the trouble to make inquiries as to the
truth of it as far as I was concerned, they would have
learnt not only that I had no connection with that
Shapira, but that he was dead, and that I was engaged
in missionary and philanthropic work in Gaza amidst a
population of 30,000, most fanatical Mohammedans, whose
hatred towards Christians was so great that, for a long
time I was obliged with my family to live in an old ruin,
because they would not let me have a proper house.
The Rev. Schapira has done more than live in a
ruin. Hear him :
I am not boasting, sir, when I say that on the *Vest
Coast of Africa I assisted in training the natives for the
ministry, the present black Bishop Olliwolli was one of
my pupils. I have left marks of my work in Sierra Leone,
in the interior of Africa, and in Palestine.
Also; . . .
Bishop Billing became a personal friend of mine, anrt
had it not been for the roving blood in me, which induced
me to accept the offer of work in Tasmania, I might still
have been at work there.
A man who has known bishops with names like
Olliwolli and Billing, who has lived in Central
Africa, Palestine and an old ruin in Gaza, and
who has been there or thereabouts when a serious
attempt was made to forge the handwriting of
Moses, is wasted as niissioner in a dead-and-alive
suburb like Longueville. In fact, he is wasted as
missioner anywhere. He should be raising Sheol
in the capacity of “ Liberal ’’ organiser, or punch-
ing out hair-raising daily-paper serials.

“ Singemoine ” : With the bitterness of
'defeat still rankling in its whiskers, Sydney
Telegraph printed a “special,” by a member of
the Public Service, entitled “The Labor Party
and the Public Service.” The grammar was poor
and many of the sentences read as though they
had been constructed with a blunt axe. But the
effort was worth while for one golden quality—its
gorgeous and radiant snobbishness. It fairly
reeked with references to “King Pick and
Shovel ” ; the vulgarity of the .Trades Hall ; the
likelihood of the Upper House being cleared awny
“ to get more salubrious quarters for the Labor
Council ” and the rest of the jargon of cheap
Suburbia. And it ended as follows
In asking for the Public Service vote the Labor member
with his tongue in his cheek might (if he had ever read
such an author) have quoted Rudyard Kipling.
It is one of the axioms of the typical Public Service
clerk—the tradeless, professionless and utterly
futile little man who is well satisfied with his life
of chronic indigence, (1) because it is safe, (2)
because it is genteel, and (3) because it involves a
minimum of hard work—that Labor members are
grossly illiterate. The public servant and his
family, whose staple mental fare consists of Home
Chat, ’Tit Bits, Answers, and the World’s
News, regard men like W. M. Hughes,
Hugh Mahon, Crawford, Griffith, Beeby. Hol-
man, Anstey, and the rest, as, intellec-
tually speaking, beneath them. Many of
them, I am sure, believe firmly that the
rank 'and file of Laborites can’t read, or. if they
can, are insufficiently advanced in the art to spell
out the minor poetry that is stolen from overseas
by the World’s News brand of publication. A
diverting figure is the anti-Labor Public Servant,
and never more so than when he seizes a pen and
essays to state the views his favorite daily has
dowered him with in the sparse vocabulary that
does service in the home circle.

The hardest blow that Fate can deal
Seems not so bad to him who lies
Prone in the dust, till this drear squeal

May hope to rise and smite anon
Until some “ friend ” makes this remark :

Who hears afar the parrot cries :

THE MISSING ORGAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
It is the opinion of medical men who have investigated
the case of the Victorian girl, Crellin, that her amazing
obesity is due to the absence of the thyroid gland, the
organ responsible for regulating the accumulation of fat.
Tlie child, though only five years old, weighs eight stone .
Nevus item.
When little miss at five years old
Accumulates a back immense,
And grows so wide that nought will hold
Her wonderful circumference,
The case the doctors understand—
She hasn’t got a thyroid gland.
But in the more notorious case
Of Patman— I whom our artists “ dinge
With pendant jowl, and glowing face,
And mighty, overflowing binge,
It’s different—each swelling part
Denotes he hasn’t got a heart!

■“ Gil Gunnia ” : Q. —Where does the wild
fowl of N.S.W. most congregate? A.—ln the
pine-scrub lying between the Bogan and Mac-
quarie Rivers. In those lone parts you will
identify the tall and semi-naked emu, likewise
the warmly clothed but insignificant diamond
sparrow. In between come the native com-
panion, ibis, shag, crane, curlew, plover, wild
■duck and numerous species of water fowl. The
parrot tribe is represented by cockatoos, galahs
(millions of ’em), king parrots, quarrions and
rosellas. Also, there are carnivorous hawks,
crows andi butcher birds, while magpies (black, as
well as the ordinary garden variety) laughing
jackasses, pee-wees, apostles, wonga pigeon,
leather-heads and swallows are plentiful. In fact,
almost the only species that you don’t find there
are the dead birds the daily paper tipsters talked
a lot about before the last Sydney races and the
last N.S.W. elections.
NOT TO BE IMPOSED UPON.
ENGLISH VISITOR: “ What! That a stockman!
Oh, come now, deah boy! Where are his
riding boots, and sombrero, and stockwhip,
and lasso, and revolvahs, and bowie knife?
Ha, ha, you see, I read a book or two before
I travelled !”
“ Dandalup ” : I disagree to the extent of
15 adjectives with “Gilrooney” (B. 29/2/TO)
when he brands the Australian prospector as an
out-and-out pessimist. I have prospected some
■myself, and from what I know and have seen I
asseverate that the chaser of the elusive reef or
lode or gutter is an optimist of the first button.
If he w asn’t he would probably make back to the
•cities by the first balloon and become one of the
great army of never-sweats. As a matter of fact,
in the lonely gully and forlorn Outback he has
hope for a mate and a cheerful heart for his next
of kin. “ Gilrooney’s ” Broken Hill pal, who re-
marked thatthe prospector, good or bad, eventually
lands in Hell, must have been grazing upon the
beer when it was flat. The prospector’s ultimate
-destination, I picture, is one packed with merry,
light-hearted, sun-browned Outback Australians,
where the clouds, woven in gold and lined with
-silver, float gracefully over an eternal river of
malt, and the screech of the wild cat is for ever
■silent.
HIS SUBURBAN HAIR.
CITY TONSORIAL ARTIST : “ City or country cut, sir!”
COUNTRY COUSIN : “ Oh, gimme one about six miles out."
“Vigilans,”concerning No-man’s Coast :
Though it is so long since his visit, “ Gentleman
James ” (B. 22/9/TO) hits off the uninhabited North Coast
well. Ten years after “ James’s” visit, namely, in 1906-
’O7, I did a bit of coasting from Port Darwin, calling at
Port Essington, Malay Bay and Blue Mud Bay. Judging
by the color of the natives on these shores, Malays have
been visiting them for centuries. Some of the bingbies
are copper-colored, others yellow ; others almost white.
They are a fine, strapping race. The males at
Malay Bay are nearly all over 6ft. ; the females
sft. 6in. and over. They are all right to look at, too ; the
nose is aquiline, the smile pleasant, the teeth perfect.
And the figure would shame the hobbled girls on the
Australian promenades. But they fade early. Many of
these people never leave the coast; others take a walk
to the small mining settlements a hundred miles or so
away. They nearly all speak a pidgin Malay-cttm-
English jargon. Horrible to relate, leprosy is prevalent.
Some authorities say this is caused by a too-frequent fish
diet; others, that itis inherited from the Malays. Another
contagious disease that is prevalent is never mentioned
in polite society. In my time a Customs lugger cruised
about the coast with one Australian officer and a num-
ber of black boys, and a Chow cook. He collected duty on
the tucker which the Malays brought with them for their
six months’ sojourn. E. 6. ltobinson, now of Melbourne
and Melville Island, was for many years stationed there;
his successor was one of the numerous Broun family of
the Territory. The duties did not pay the officers’ screw,
so the patrol was knocked off, and the Malays and natives
now have the coast to themselves. When the proas arrive
there is a “ beano,” and no mistake. Hundreds of
hybrids assemble, and squareface, opium and a Malay
spirit is given in exchange for the girls. The same thing
obtains at Beagle Bay(VV.A.) when the pearling luggers
call there. The coast is rich in turtle, trepang and fish ;
and crocodiles abound. I can heartily recommend a trip
there to a party of sportsmen., It will pay,’ too ; buffalo
and Urahmin cartle are in the vicinity, and wildfowl are
in millions. Luggers are cheap in Port Darwin, and a
camera would pay its own passage.

“Kava Kava”: “Wal’s” Papuan tree
alligator (B. 9/6/TO) boils down in real life to just
plain gohanna or young croc, taking a sun bath on
some tree overhanging a creek or stream. Have
managed to shoot one or two, but they are too
slick into the water at the slightest sound to give
a man much chance of a shot.

“ Yarrum” : Said Judkins ruminatively :
“It was in Sowth Aus., and I wuz mashing a
piece there whose dad had a bit of a vineyard—
no, they weren’t Germans, not by a long way.
Well, one night (after midnight it was) I was in
theboodwah with this piece. She wasan only child,
and had a sort of private sweet. There was a big
sittin’-room between her and where the old people
dossed. We were havin’ a quiet cup of tea, some
choice grapes and a hit of rainbow-cake she’d
manufactured herself that afternoon. The cake
was mighty heavy stuff, but it wasn’t for me to
say so. Just then somebody walked in at the
back door of the big sittin’-room, and we twigged
the gleam of a lantern on the opposite wall. ’ I
was in one of my tight corners all right—fair up
against it. Dad had come out to see the time o’
night, and thought he’d find how Matilda was doin’
at the same time. He came as far as the door of the
boodvvah, but didn’t look behind it, which was
lucky for him, as I was behind that door with my
cup-o’-tea. I’d taken the precaution to remove
that from off the gipsy-table, which was also a bit
of luck. I might mention that the old man hated
me more than Wade does the thought of them leg-
irons ; and I couldn’t have him see, and reco'nise
me at any price. Well, after he’d gone, Tasked
Tilda how she had been feelin’, and she said she’d
■been prayin’ for me all the time. Then she asked
what I’d have done had I been discovered. I told
her that if the old blighter had put his nose round
the door I’d have given him a woodener, and then
raced for safety over his corpse. She laughed fit
to burst her wrapper. With that I drank up my
tea, and left the trollop. I’ve no time for a girl
as hasn’t some little respect for her aged parents.”
Westralia, like Maoriland, has a mania for
importing outlandish beasts and other animals to
combat various pests that have settled in the
country. Recently, about 1,000,000 fish were cap-
tured in the Barbadoes on the strength of their
alleged weakness for mosquitoes. About 999,950
of the tittlebats died on the voyage, but 50 arrived
sound in wind and limb, and are now being sooled
on to-the local skeeter. After settling that trou-
ble, the tittlebat might be induced to visit Queens-
land, and have a few rounds with the prickly-pear.
“ Mundowie ” : He “Larrakeyah” (B.
6/10/T0) and “Vigilans” (B. 21/7/T0) about the
sale of aboriginal and half-caste children to Chows
and bad whites in the Northern Territory. I
knew a prospector, a white man, to sell to a mate
a young half-caste lubra for a 501 b. bag of flour,
worth about 12s. 6d. As for selling them to the
Chows, it is quite a recognised thing among the
blacks to dispose of them that way. To switch off
on to another subject. “ Vigilans” is right when
he says that cotton grows wild on the shores of
Port Darwin and along the rivers. I have my-
self seen it growing 200 miles from the sea. The
N.T. is a grand country, and, when the line is
built from Oodnadatta, it will he the best of Aus-
tralia. I have been all through the sugar country
in North Queensland, and am satisfied that there
is just as good, if not better, in the N.T. I have
crossed on foot from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta,
so I think I am entitled to have a word on the
subject of the Territory. And that brings me up
against the subject-of bush hospitality. It is a
real thing, all right. I. have never wanted for a
feed in the bush, and I’m not a Fat man.
* * * *
“J.G.” : lie “E.S.S.” and wet sheep
(B. 29/9/TO). “ E.S.S.’s ” yarn would have been
more convincing if he had mentioned
the shed or sheds where (1) the classer
put out a piece of dry wool and a piece
of wet, and the rep. chose the dry
wool and said it was the wet; (2)
where damp sheep were shorn without
protest, and dry ones were not shorn
because the shearers said they were
wet. I would be loth to say that
“E.S.S.” is as unreliable as Wade and
his cobbers; but still I would like to get
further evidence of his wet-sheep state-
ment. If “E.S.S.” is anything of a
shearer, he will know that a man has
not to shear many damp sheep before
he gets wet through, from his waist to
his toes, and from his elbows to his
finger-tips. And it is quite a different
dampness from the natural oily damp-
ness of the yolk. The average shearer
these times is out to make the biggest
cheque he can m the shortest possible
time ; there are not many who want to
knock off and loaf about the huts, and
pay for their tucker and do nothing.
They want to be at it and cut out as
early as possible, so as to get another
few sheds before the shearing finishes ;
so jumbueks have to be wet before a
board wants to knock off. Perhaps,
though, “E.S.S.” is not referring to
present-day shearers, but to those of
the stormy strike times in the early
days of the A.W.U. —the “squatters’
darlings,” who were quite capable of
not knowing when a sheep was wet
or dry. In those times, I’ll admit, men were
put on shearing who didn’t know a sheep from a
native eat.
* * * *
“ Kava Kava ” : Sorry to throw doubts
on “ Wal’s” yarn (B. 9/6/TO) re Rossel Islanders,
but there is a good deal of uncertainty as to its
truth. The St. Paul was certainly wrecked on
Adele Island, but the 300 odd of the Yellow
Agony made rafts and got away to the north-
ward. For one thing, the Rossel natives have
yet to be proved cannibals, and, anyhow, 300
Chows would be a match for the whole of the
population put together and then doubled, even
supposing they had no better arms than sticks
and stones. The population of Rossel cannot
exceed a couple of thousand at the outside, and
they are a singularly utiwarlike folk. I doubt
whether the natives of those days had the White
Australia policy sufficiently at heart to pass the
yellow men into the cooking pots.
“ Caber ”; In the early days of Stanthorpe
(Queensland border), when tin was to he had tor
the paddocking ” and was worth selling, the
Chows flocked there in droves. One day, Joe
Pillar’s paper, the Border Post, reported a
death in Asia’s camp, and, as some of us had
never seen a dead Chinky, we decided to go
along. We found the corpse in sole possession of
the back part of a two-roomed humpy, and
the jabbering from the front room made it
clear that a fan-tan school was in opera-
tion. I don’t know which of us gave birth
to the inspiration, but it was a flash of genius.
Lifting Pong, deceased, we quietly went out as
we had walked in, by the back door, carried him
round the shanty, and propped him, face inward
and with a forward cant, against the frontdoor.
Then we adjourned across the road and hurled a
lump of granite at the roof. Next instant an
infuriated Chow yanked the door open, and was
immediately pounced on by the cadaver. The
succession of shrieks from under the body
of the departed was like a mad-house
being fried in its own fat. The lan-
tan players, thinking their mate was being
murdered by an army of “lallikins,” sprang
out to save him, but when they saw who hail him
they broke through the bark walls of the humpy,
and tore howling down Quart Pot Creek'. By this
time the pigtail who had been pinned down by the
“stiff” had broken away, but he was too terror-
stricken to stand, and was going for the scrub
frog-fashion. Before the police could arrive to
inquire who had pulled the cork out of Tophet,
we slipped across the road and raided the joint.
There was 375. 6d. on the table, and with this we
scooted to Austin Carrigg’s pub, where we drank
long life to the corpse.

“A.8.M.”: The truthful narrative of
Harry the Fisherman :
Talkin’ about falls from aloft. We was runnin’ out of
Newcastle for the West Coast onthe Garisbrooke Castle,
pne of the tallest ships that ever took the water. I was
aloft on the liiain-topgallant yard, shakin’ out the sail,
hot hangin’ on in particler, when all of a sudden, me not
expectin’it, we got the first roller on the bar and she
jjfave a hell of a heave. I went, but not far. Hi&ht under
me, on the upper-topsail yard, was a German chap we
called Carl, a darned good-natured feller. I fell fair on
him, and he went. I just managed to save nieself and
hold, but Carl took up the runnin’ for me oh the way
down. I didn’t look, mind ye’. I was all out.
I just hung on and froze to that yard. After a bit 1
looked down and couldn’t see nothin’ of Carl on the
deck, but I see someone mountin’ the shrouds,
and, when he got up a bit, bless me if it wasn’t the Gei-
man. Just then he must have been red-hot. Ye know
how a spider shakes his web with rage when a fly gits
away from him. Well, that was the way them shrouds
was shakin’. He come up, and just as he was climbin’
over the cross-trees on one side of the yard I slides round
the mast and down the other side. You bet I made a
smart passage to the deck, and as soon as I touched it i
stieaked for the fo’castle, just for the sake of company.
Presently Carl come along, all smilin’(l think I told ye he
was a good-tempered chap), and he says : “ P.v turider, it’s
agoot yob I don’t catch you just now ven I vos angry, or
I smack you ofer de moud, for dot. Yes.” Be cripes he
was a decent chap, and no mistake.
How did he come out of it alive ? Well, it seems when
befell, the ship bein’on the heave, ye see, lie plunked
on to the main-topmast-stay, slid on his hack half-way
down that, and then fell on to the main-stay, slippin’
down it till he struck the mast, when it was only a soft
drop to the deck-house. Then he started after me.
While we was talkin’ about the matter there the first mate
come forrard and says : “ Aloft there, blast ye, and shake
out that fore-sail. If there’s any more of this skylarkin’
I’ll find a way of dealin’ with you blokes."
THE FLY IN THE OINTMENT.
S MACKER: "How's things?"
KNOCKER: “ Alright. Still workin ’, though!”
“ Griffi ” : He’s dead now, is Micky
Moran, but lie lived long enough to get even with
old Skint, his boss. Micky was doing some
fencing for Skint, and, having received his
cheque, got “paralytic” on the strength of it.
Next morning he appeared before the Jay Pees,
Skint being chairman on the Bench. They fined
Micky 10s. without the option, and Micky had to
pay. But Micky had some more work to do for
Skint, and having finished it lie wrote out a list
of the completed jobs.as required by the boss, got
his cheque, and departed. That evening, when
Skint looked through the account, he read with
much indignation : ■“ Friday, March 6 ; to attend-
ing Ruperville Court, 10s.”
ANOTHER SONG OF SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Varlet, my lute ! The Spring is here, and with it comes
a taste fpr beer,
For sunny days, for open air and stripey suits for summer
wear.
Hooray ! The Spring is here !
(Yes, please,
A beer!)
The buds are bursting on the trees.
Gimme me lyre, lad ! Let me sing
My joyous, foaming Song of Spring !
The wattle—blow the- wattle! Spring is here, at any
rate ; so fling
A-ide your load of winter care, and put some beer-blooms
in your hair !
Beer-time is on the wing.
There is
No sting
In beer in Spring, when life’s a-fizz
And swarms of poets rise to sing
Another lovely Song of Spring.
The thrush is heard in—Well, one more ! A beer?- Yes,
beer. Why, yes, I swore
Off winter beer some time ago ; but Spring is here at last,
and so—
Oh, beer in Spring is joy, .
01’ chap !
Dear boy,
Spring holds new pleasures in her lap I
And now’s the time for carolling
New songs of bliss and beer and Spring.
The sun shines warm ; the birds are gay all through the
kind, delightful day ;
It’s great to be alive, and know a place to which dry souls
may go
And watch the beer-pumps piny
By night
Or day,
Careless of time and lucre’s flight,
And sit there manufacturing
Another splendid Song of Spring.
VICTORIA.

F. 0. Robinson, Proprietor
“ Sinbad Smith”: I would like to ask
Curator A. S. Le Souef (B. 29/9/'10) where he is
going to get his 7s. 6d. each, or £4 10s. per dozen,
for ’possum skins. I sold over 50 doz. during the
past winter, and none of them averaged more
than 30s. per dozen. These were New England
(N.S.W.) skins, which are considered a good class.
The highest price I got was 58s. per doz. for a few
in a bundle of about 25 doz. Locally, they have
been bought for the last 12 months at from 15s. to
355. per doz., according to fluctuations of Sydney
market. Le Souef does not appear to make any
allowance for rumpers, or skins damaged in snar-
ing, and counts all at the exceptional price of
7s. 6d., which price a person might get for (say)
10 in 1000. He also says opossums do not travel.
He is mistaken. Also, that they breed once a
year. I think they breed twice at least. I have
got them with young all the year round. He says
the man whogot £5OO for the right (?) to snare about
3000 opossums was foolish. I consider the other
fellow was the fool to give him over 3G.s. per dozen
for skins, and take all the trouble. Anyhow, if
his 3000 opossums were in our district the cyanide
fiend would have had them for nix, unless he was
prepared to distribute traps as numerously as you
see them at a Wadeite election meeting.
The Hangman removed his pipe, and spat
reflectively :
Yes ; it’s just prejudice. I’ve met plenty chaps who
reckoned I was good enough to knock round and have a
drink with until they found out I was the hangman—
then they used to dodge me. Seemed scared of me. I
remember one who grew' suspicious one night in a bar,
and I told him straight out who I was. “ But,” I says to
him, “that oughtn’t to make any difference.” With
which I raised my glass to clink against his. I’ve seen a
lot of men go white sudden-like, but none like that cove.
His glass fell crash on the floor, and he stepped back-
wards to the door with his eyes glarin’ at my hands.
When he reached the entrance I saw his white face flash
round to the street, and then 1 heard his footsteps run-
ning into the night. .. . Other hangmen ? Yes. . . . The
cove that turned off the Mount Rennie boys was a police-
nian with 15 years’ service when he resigned to take
charge of the rope. Three quid a week was the pay, and
lie thought to do a bit of carpentering in betw'een whiles.
They blocked him, though. He used to make coffins for
a Sydney undertaker—sort of all-round man. . . . Most of
them go on a jag just before a job. Tom Long, in Maori-
land, was generally arrested and locked up some days
before the date. Gately and Banford, of Melbourne, used
to brace up beforehand. .. . Nosey Bob made a
vow never to drink in a pub, and he kept it
as far as I know'. He used to go in and order his liquor,
and then drink it outside —sometimes in the back yard,
sometimes on the front steps. You could smell Nosey
coming. Remember one job he had which impresses the
smell. When the job reached the scaffold, Nosey bore
alongside and the job shrank away. “ It’s all right, old
man,” sax s Nosey ; “ it’ll soon be over.” “It ain’t that,”
said the patient, “it’s the hum that hurts.” He
was a queer bloke, Nosey. Time of the Burton-street
(Sydney) tragedy, when a girl was outraged and then
murdered, Nosey was speaking- to a detective about the
case alongside the Darlinghurst Gaol before an arrest
had been made. The demon says: “This is a
terrible thing. Bob.” Nosey raises his hat as reverently
as a bishop, and says, “As big an old sinner ns I am, I’d
hang that for the love of it.” He ’ung him, sure
enough.... B'djobs? Yes; but they ain’t pretty to
talk about. There was one old bloke who was very
light, and he didn’t take the jerk. Twenty minutes he
was. . . . Swinging on a bloke’s feet when he’s like that?
I 've heard of it bein’ done, hut I never see it ... . There
was another bloke w-hose arm caught in the rope, and
there was a bloke whose head came—what? Oh, all
right; brandy and soda.. . . Well, here’s long life.

“ Leo Lear ” : “ Itan ” asks (B. 29/9/TO)
which Australian tree produees the coolest shade.
His Moreton Bay fig is good, and so are many
others of the clan ficus, notably the beautiful
weeping fig of tropical Bananaland, and the Port
Jackson ditto. But they are all overshadowed by
the Moreton Bay chestnut. If the most heated
“ Abo.” controversy were put under one of these
trees, it would solidify in two paragraphs. Does
“ Itan ” know which native tree gives the least
shade? I enter mallee. Anyone who seeks
shade under mallee would use six-inch mesh wire
netting as a mosquito net.
“ Leo Lear ” describes an aboriginal :
The ceratodus (local name, Burnett salmon) that
various “Abo.” writers are discussing, is the most
famous fish that Australia has pushed under the spec •
tacles of the scientific world, ranking in imporiance with
the platypus and echidna. It has disappeared from all
rivers, bar the Burnett and Mary. In appearance a full-
grown ceratodus is a long, black fish with a light-colored
belly, and his top coat consists of extra large scales. He
has a tail like an eel’s, and two fins on either side of the
body. His favorite residence is a deep pool containing
large boulders. An odd one is occasionally hooked ; but
as they run up to nearly 4ft. in length, netting is the
surer way of landing the lung fish. During the big
drought, when the Burnett creekswere reduced to a few
holes, dozens were caught in last remaining patches of
liquid. The fish will live for hours out of water, and if
wrapped in a wet sack can be kept alive for days. They
are not considered of much account as a table delicacy
unless smoked and dried. For years scientists were unable
to learn much concerning ceratodi, as no ova could he,
found. It was not till about 1890 that a Cambridge gradu-
ate, named Caldwell, was fortunate enough to seeuie
a few eggs surrounded by a gelatinous substance, for
which he paid £lO to the finder. In 1892 Prof. Semon,
of Jena University, came to the Burnett to study Aus-
tralia’s specialty in salmon. He engaged a number of
black brothers, and they collected quantities of ova,
which were hatched in Germany. In 1898, Mr. O’Connor,
of Brisbane, succeeded in taking the first live ceratodi to
Europe. He shipped four from the Mary River, sold two
for £45 to the Zoological Society in England (when last
heard from they were alive and well), and the other two
he sold in Paris.
“Edyson”: The most diverting inter-
family feud I have ever heard of is the one exist-
ing between the Smiths and the Smythes, in a
stylish suburb of Melbourne. The Smiths and
the Smythes are not “common” people either
(they swagger a great deal, and their adjoining
residences would be called palatial by almost any
reporter who knows his business); but the Smiths
have had the Smythes to court five times, and the
Smythes have had the Smiths to court five times
—in every instance for defamatory language
poured over the dividing fence. The Smiths were
the first to introduce a bird into the argument.
He was a large, bedraggled cockatoo, who had
kept evil company in his youth, and his fowl
language was particularly gamey. Set on a
high perch, he was employed to express
the Smiths’ opinion of the Smythes from
two to four duly, Sundays and holidays
not excepted. Of course, it was not
publicly advertised that what the
specimen of mediaeval poultry was
saying was deliberately applied to
the Smythes, but the Smythes under-
stood, and retaliated with a flaring
South American parrot, who had been
for years in the society of the skipper
of a Yankee tramp steamer. The
Smith cockatoo was no match for the
Smvfhe parrot, so the Smiths bought
an Indian minah with a hotel educa-
tion, and put it up to support the
cockatoo. The Smythes secured rein-
forcements in the shape of a magpie,
schooled by a railway ganger, and
vocal war is still raging over the back
fence, with increasing volume and a
vigor that is renewed weekly. ■lt has
got about that the Smiths and the
Smythes will buy any old bird pos-
sessed of a debased vocabulary, with
the result that the swelling clamor of
language is bringing down rents in
the neighborhood. The local council
and Willie Judkins’s Moral Reform
Bureau have been implored to interfere in the
interests of public decency, but meanwhile the
rival aviaries are in active 'eruption, and the
Smiths and the Smythes have the callous air of
people to whom abuse is second nature.

“Silas S.”: Cadwallader’s “boiling-down”
was at once the bane and blessing of Sheepfold.
It worked pretty well all the year round, and Cad-
wallader’s output of tallow and bones and side-
products provided a substantial part of Sheep-
fold’s net income. But the industry spread a rich,
juicy, nut-brown smell all over Sheepfold and the
surrounding district; and eventually it got about
that Sheepfold’s chance of becoming a fashionable
rural resort for holiday-makers was being wrecked
by the everlasting flavor of boiled sheep that
welled from Cad’s establishment. The shire
council was therefore called upon to consider
the inadvisability of keeping the township
continually in bad odor. It looked as if
Cadwallader’s “boiling-down” was about to
be outed, till Cr. Davy arose. Cr. Davy owned
and ran the Drovers’ Arms, and he protested
against the removal of the “ boiling-down ” with
such eloquence and force that the proposal to
shift the scent-mill was lost on the voices. Next
evening Cr. Davy explained over the bar : “Move
th’ boiling-down ? Not on your life ! Why, on
dark nights, there’s many a chap from Windmill
and Snowtop, and Kooreebuckup and Mill Wheel
couldn’t find their way into Sheepfold with their
bits of cheques if it wasn’t for the boilin’-down.
Damitall, I’d ha’ been lost in the Worry Scrub
meself one Sunday, but, thank Heaven for its
mercies, th’ boilin’-down started on Monday, and
I smelled me way out! ”
“ C.K.Y.” forwards a case of curses from
the bush :
(1) First house eaten down by white ants. (2) Second
house ditto. (3) Third house now being built—their
dessert. (4) All the first fence posts also devoured. (5>
Second lot now being masticated. (6) Pest poison merely
used as chewing gum. (7) Rats and mice in hundreds
chew’ or destroy two seasons’ hay. (8) More ants —meat-
ants, sugar-ants, black-and-tan ants, bulldog ants,,
soldier-ants and pigeon-toed ants. (9) Wire-netted
orchard ; netting seems to keep hares and rabbits in
instead of out. (10) Scores of expensive and carefully-
tended trees ruined by them. (11) Four different visits-
from wild cats to the poultry-yard. (12) Gohannas
steal the eggs. (13) Foxes collected new detach-
ment of poultry. (14) Orchard trees got black and
red scale, foot-rot, white lice, fruit fly, wax scale, sun-
scald, wire worms, crickets, borers, bark-eaters, and 78
different species of beeiles. (15) Mosquitoes turn the
wheel of Purgatory during the night, while the flies that
have been at it all day have a rest. (16) Wild dogs chase
your milkers till they drop dead. (17) Fruit inspectors,
statistical police, Afghan hawkers, sewing-machine
pushers. (18) A neighbor to borrow' the horse you can’t
spare from your own Work. (19) Bush fire next day.
(20) Hawks and snakes sample the chickens. (21) Ticks
killing the,'dogs. (22) Moth destroying the bees. (23)’
Silver fish ruining my Sunday pants. (24) Lumpy jaw-
massacred three cows. (25) Fistula settled the mare.
Talk about life in the bush ! You can’t kill it with,
dynamite.

“Wang’s” evening entertainment :
The jumping-picture people missed a great chance last
w r eek in Melbourne. A middle-aged female, with a bull-
dog attached, entered a chemist’s shop opposite my
house, and, in order that she might have her hands free
to talk, she tied John Bull’s thong to a chair. John
dumped his butt-end on the floor, and sat scowling to-
wards the open dooway. Presently several small
boys came down the street, and, chancing to
look into the shop, saw John’s forbidding coun-
tenance. Their admiration rapidly turned to ridicule,,
and finally, a well-aimed piece of orange-peel collided
with John’s eye. Instantly the animal aeroplaned
through the doorway with the chair in tow. A stand of
scent-bottles, bicycle pumps and other medical comforts
was overturned ; and an agitated female, followed by a.
more agitated chemist, rushed after ihe careering ’plane
just in time to see him sprinting up the street w'ith a.
chair bumping in his wake. An agitated old gentleman,,
who endeavored to get out of the way of the
flying boys, was overturned by the swinging chair ;
and the bulldog bit him on the leg en route
for his prey. The smallest boy, who was at the rear of
the procession, stopped J. Bull’s progress for a moment
by clouting him on the nose with a heavily-laden school-
bag; whereupon the air was full of profane yelps and
broken chair. As a last resource, the small boy dived
into a shop, followed by the enraged pursuer. What,
transpired in that shop I . could only guess from the-
shrieks of boy and the wreckage of furniture. The last
I saw of the performance was a vast policeman standing
on the pavement with his feet on the bull-dog’s neck,,
taking the names of 27 differentpeople.
“ Ossy ” : The indifference of the average-
cow-cocky to everything outside the absorbing
subject of extracting juice from the lady ox is
appalling, and his ignorance of current events
colossal. Talking with One of them recently, the
conversation turned to railway matters, and I
happened to mention the Richmond smash-.
Cocky hadn’t heard of it. Said he “didn’t read
the papers.” The feverish pursuit of Mrs. Bull
left him no available time. He wasn’t acquainted
with the Sunshine horror either. Refrained
from inquiring his opinion on the Federal Note
Bill, or. the compulsory training scheme; but I
did ask him if he thought Wade would keep his
job after the 14th. “ Wade? ”he said. “What
Wade?” “Charlie Wade—you know Charlie,”
I answered. “No,” he said; “what’s he do?”
“Well, now you ask me,” I told him, “he does
nothing of much value.” “Ho!” says cocky;
“then he oughter be passed out on his ear. '
After that we parted the best of friends.

AN AUSTRALIAN MENU-A LA DEAKIN.
Melbourne, Wednesday.—The debate on the second reading of the Bill to grant the Commonwealth greater legislative powers was continued in the House of Representatives.
Mr. Deakin said the system of hurrying through legislation, inyplving important principles, and extensive Constitutional alterations, was dangerous. It was a form of quick
lunch legislation, which must bring about the effects that the quick lunch device had ultimately upon the human frame. (Hear, hear.)

A SIMPLE PRESCRIPTION.
Said to Cure Rheumatism, Kidney Trouble and
Bladder Troubles.
We know that the readers of this paner appre-
ciate good advice, and we are glad, therefore, to
be able to publish the following from a prominent
physician.
It is astonishing to know the prevalence of
kidney trouble and other diseases, such as rheu-
matism, bladder and liver troubles, which are
almost invariably caused by weak kidneys. It is
said on good authority that fully one-third of the
people in Australia who have reached the age of
maturity are more or less afflicted with kidney
trouble in some form. The most dangerous feature
of this disease is the fact that many people have it
without their knowledge, and consequently neglect
it until it has reached a dangerous stage.
The least symptom of kidney trouble, such as
backache, must be given prompt attention, and a
good reliable treatment should be taken, until
every trace of the disease has been eliminated.
We are glad to be able to give our readers a
prescription which we have seldom known to fail
in any case. It contains no harmful ingredients,
is pleasant to take, not expensive, and can be
supplied by any good chemist. It is as follows:
Tincture Gentian Compound, one ounce; Syrup
Rhubarb, one ounce ; Liquid Barkola Compound,
one ounce ; Syrup of Ginger, five ounces.
Take a teaspoonful after each meal, and one at
bedtime.
We are glad to publish this prescription, as we
know it will help our afflicted readers who give it
a' fhir ’trial. 1 If taken cohtinously for a few
weeks, it will be found to be an almost absolutely
certain cure for rheumatism! kidney and bladder
trouble, backache and all allied complaints.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
N.S.W. Premier McGowen, though a
boilermaker by trade, used to be a pretty fair
sliortbander, and over 30 years ago taught a Pit-
man class at Bathurst.
Died last week in Victoria, Mrs. Ann
Smith, formerly Mrs. Ann Jones. Mrs. Smith
(then Jones) had one crowded day in her career.
Thirty years ago she and her children and Mr.
Jones were among the inmates of the Glenrowan
Hotel when the Kelly bushrangers did their last
flutter, and she was left a widow amid the
scrimmage.
There are three whirlwinds in McGowen’s
Ministry. Unlike the Premier, Holman is notably
clear and concise ; but, when he is in a hurry (and
lie’ll be in several hurries before long) the pencils
following him perspire at every pore and whistle
for brakes. Some shorthanders say that Holman
is faster than Deakin when he is in a hurry, and
the man who - is faster than Deakin ought toj have
a Westinghouse attached to his oratory. Nielsen,
of the Lands, is also in the whirlwind class when
lie is excited or annoyed. Trefle, the third of the
bunch, is a long-distance talker, and fast, too ; but
as honorary Minister he will be cut down solidly.
A feature of the fight for the Newcastle
(N.S.W.) Assembly seat was that it was between
two ex-State-school teachers. Arthur Gardiner,
who won, is a comparative youngster of 33.
His father was a farmer in the Hawkesbury dis-
trict, and young Arthur helped to milk the cows
till he won a “full’’ scholarship to the Sydney
Training College. After that he pedagogiied in
metropolitan schools till 1903, when he was shifted
to Newcastle. There he became secretary of the
Wickham P.L.L., and helped Grahame win the
local seat from Fegan. When the Newcastle
P.L.L. set about getting a candidate for the last
election, Gardiner easily defeated L. P. Vial, who
failed to win the seat from Owen Gilbert in 1907,
and, on present appearances, he ought to be able
to keep it.
Died, in a Sydney suburb last week,
Elizabeth Wellbank, relict of Sydney’s old-time
nautical printer and stationer, whose “Well-
bank’s Nautical Almanac” was famous half a
century ago. He carried on business in those
days in partnership with James Reading, whose
name is preserved in “Mr. James,” of the
S. M. Herald. Mrs. Wellbank was supposed to
have missed the century by only one year.
The fact that J. It. Dacey, the old-
established member for Botany, was not included
in the N.S.W. Labor Ministry, even as an
honorary person, was a surprise to many people.
Probably Dacey “did his dash ” on that insane
spring evening when he declared that he would
rather see N.S.W. ruled by the local Upper House
of Tory life nominees than by a Federal Parlia-
ment elected by adult suffrage. There are
lamentable streaks of parisb-inindedness about
the State Labor party ; but it has to draw the
line somewhere, and the line has been drawn at
J. R. Dacey.
F. B. Clapp did the official talking for the
Melbourne Train Co. when Murray’s select com-
mittee called to find out why there shouldn’t be
sectional fares and other improvements. A
pathetic figure is Clapp nowadays. He is 70, and
looks 80; he is very feeble and quite blind, and
has to rely on his daughters and his private secre-
tary for almost everything. Yet he is keen to
work—and just as keen to be left alone. “The
Act never contemplated sectional fares,” lie
pleaded. “The company began on uniform fares
and the system worked well for all. It has satis-
fied the municipalities ; it has satisfied the com-
pany [modest company !], and it has distributed
the public to their homes.” Still, when one
comes to think of it, how could Clapp be ex-
pected to speak for anybody but the company ?
What the badly-paid and overworked employees
and the badly-handled and overcharged cus-
tomers think about the system is for other folks
to say.
The Westralian Assembly never knew
what a poor opinion it had of itself till the other
day. Wilson, the new Premier, has a majority
of only one or two at most (especially since
ex-Attorney-General Keenan went over to
Labor), wherefore, when it wanted a Chair-
man of Committees, it fished and caught
“ Mulga ” Taylor. Now “Mulga” is one of
the old stalwarts of the Labor party, and the
Labor party saw in the nomination a plot to
weaken its vote while preserving Wilson's un-
impaired. So it decided that really Taylor wasn’t
the man for the job, and nominated Foulkes.
But Foulkes was too busy or bashful; so George
was nominated. George blushed and said it was
too much honor, and he wouldn’t dream of stand-
ing while “Mulga” was in the field. Then
Jacoby was told what a splendid Chairman he
used to be ; which made it Jacoby’s turn to blush
and mumble that he was too busy also. The
silent Moore was next urged to come to his
country’s call; and the mere suggestion took his
breath away. About this stage a couple of Labor
men collapsed, and threw their votes in with the
Government’s, and “ Mulga ” was elected.
CLATTER! CHINK!! CIRIAISIHIII
A November Nightmare.
Frank- Stuart, who has just died in the
Red ;Sea on board the incoming Otranto, was
about equally loaded with public spirit and brains.
He was a refined character of aesthetic tastes, and
took a genuine interest in sport, besides attending
to his softgoods business and serving some
spells of Parliamentary life. He represented
East Melbourne in 1889, and had a seat in
the Mnnro Cabinet. About that time he took a
lot of interest in a sizeable inter-State A.N.Ai
conference held in Melbourne, presided over by
ex-Premier Johnny Bray, of Adelaide, at which a
considerable boost was given to the Federal move-
ment. Subsequently he got into the House of
Fat, sitting on behalf of Melbourne North from
1904 to 1907. In business he had been managing
partner of Lincoln, Stuart and Co. since about
1886, and, prior to that, served a long and arduous
experience in the softgoods trade. Stuart, who
was born at Penrith (N.S.W.) in 1844, had made
Melbourne his home for 44 years.
E. A. Rennie, the unswerving old gentle-
man who. as N.S.W. Auditor-General, told the
truth and shamed the Devil for 20 years, cele-
brated his 90th birthday one day last week.
Away in the early ’forties Mr. Rennie was assis-
tant teacher to his father, who kept the College
High School, in Castlereagh-street, Sydney.
But a few years of pedagoguing sufficed ; he then
joined thepublic service, and was something better
than an ornament to it for 57 years.
Captain George Douglas Hamilton has
been stirring up the M.L. Parliament again
concerning his old grievance against the
Bank of New Zealand. Away back in
1857 Hamilton secured 30,000 odd acres
,f land from the natives, and ob-
tained advances from the bank
that at last reached £(!8,000.
Then the bank closed on him,
and putting the property up
to auction bought it in at
£5OOO, which, of course,
really meant £73,000, see-
ing that it had already
paid out £OB,OOO. Hamil-
ton, who is now an old
man of 75, has for years
sought compensation from
the Government, which
bought about half the land
a few years after the bank
sale for £90,000; but the
bank strenuously denies
that it exercised any sharp
practice, and, so far, the
Government has said no-
thing, which is probably
all it will say. Hamilton
is one of the Ahercorn
Hamiltons ; another of
them was Regent of Scot-
land in the long ago. Dur-
ing the Maori war this
M.L. sprig of the family
was appointed captain to a
special service of scouts,
and he finished up with the
Maoriland war medal on
his chest.
A send-off to a parson
who didn’t keep his eye on
the front pews :
A. C. Sutherland, M. A., 8.D., for 14 years minister of
the Port Adelaide Presbyterian Church, has gone where,
according to all accounts, his old curse of asthma won’t
i rouble him any more. Like many another old army
chaplain (he served at Malta and Gibraltar), he was a
Radical in politics, who advocated a White Australia,
public ownership of trams, etc., and taxation of land
values, and didn’t hide his Bullktin when he saw a
parishioner coming. He was strongly anti-Jingo. During
the height of the war frenzy he advocated the Boer
cause, and hacked Butler’s judgment on the S’African
situation as against Milner’s. In consequence he was for
a time the best hated man in- Port Adelaide ; but when
he left he was the best respected. In a personal way he
was charming—all the more so because he was full of
reminiscences of Gladstone, Bright and Palmerston, as
well as of Professors Blackie and Drummond and other
big men.
“ Ami ” : Mayor Davey, Melbourne’s new
one, was hoisted into the position by his wife.
She is the daughter of Attorney Harry
Westley, who lias been Mayor of Haw-
Hawthorn. Another of the Westley brothers
married Alice Wiseman, one of a trio of
somewhat eminent little actresses —the others
being Fanny (Mrs. Monty South) and Emily
(Mrs. .T. L. Hall). Mrs. Davey is one of
the tributes to improved female education;
she also has the advantages of being fashion-
aide and beautiful—middle-size blonde, of a
rather aquiline type, well-rounded. It is
only a few years since the marriage. She
will impel Davey to strike out. Burston,
the last Mayor, spoke bravely, but didn’t
claim enough authority. Melbourne falls
between three stools : So many things there
are as to which it is not known whether the
Chief Secretary, the Police Commissioner or
the Mayor ought to take an initiative.
The last mail brings news of the death
of Fremiet, sculptor of the Joan of Arc at
the Melbourne Public Library. There is a
replica in the Place des Pyramides, Paris.
A rival statue is Foyatier’s, in Orleans;
but Foyatier’s Joan is ideal and ethereal,
and furnished with a thoroughbred-looking
horse. Fremiet was recognised as the next-
best animal sculptor to Barye, whom he suc-
ceeded as lecturer in the principal art school
of that line. He began as a lithographer,
then passed to painting, but took to sculping
in 1843, and kept at it. He executed 200
fine works, including the horrible gorilla
carrying off the woman, somewhere hidden in
the Melbourne Public Library.
Janies 11. Elliott, one of the Elliotts of
the great chemical works at Balmain (Sydney),
had a funeral last week. He was a son of the late
James Elliott, solicitor of Lincoln’s Inn, who
came out to Australia in the early ’4o’s, on the
advice of Bishop Broughton and Sir George
Gipps, schoolmates of his. The son just dead was
the last survivor of the family of boys. The other
sons were General Elliott, who died during the
Abyssinian War; Dr. G. R. Elliott and Fred
Elliott, who were the founders of the Elliott
Brothers’firm ; and another Elliott who lived in
Queensland. James R. was squatting for a while
before he went into the chemical-manufacturing
business; and he helped to propel the latter in-
dustry for 32 years.
The folk of the U.S. live mostly by
making teeth and pills for each other, and they
have a curious habit of using ordinary surnames
as Christian names. Therefore, when we hear of
a weird American outrage we cheerfully assume
that the offender was a dentist and that later ad-
vices will show his complete name to be Johnson
Jones Jobson, or words to that effect. Crippen,
sentenced to death in London for the obliteration
and dissection of his wife, answers to the usual
description. His front names are Hawley
Harvey. He took a degree in 1884 at a squalid
little college of homoeopathy in a small back
town of tJncle Sam’s country. He practised
here and there and off and on for 10 years, and
apparently got no further ahead of the game.
Then he moved to London as manager of a
patent medicine concern at £3 a week, and left
it for an ‘‘institute,” which sold pills, rubbed
weak backs, advised upon corns and the like.
The institute burst, and Crippen was employed
by the Gold ‘ Tooth Filling Co., which also went
under. So did his next employers, the Sovereign
Remedy Co. In fact, Ethel le Neve’s hero was a
shabby, anxious, scrubby, shambling little many
extracting a precarious living from the public’s
hollow tooth, and with the best part of his life and
prospects behind him. He hadn’t even the
ingenuity to call himself anything brighter than
Robinson when he flell from his old haunts ; yet
he should have known that no person called
Robinson is ever taken seriously.
James Allan Thomson, one of the geolo-
gists who will accompany Scott on his expedition
to that Far South portion of the globe, whose
chief resources are newspaper “copy,” and the
article that makes whisky palatable in the sum-
time time, is a Maorilander. He was born in
Dunedin, was Maoriland’s tirst Rhodes scholar ;
was appointed to a college lectureship in geology
at Oxford in 1907 ; and subsequently was elected
a Fellow of the Geological Society.
IN THIS AGE OF HUSTLE.
THE SON: “ Pa , there arc two million bacilli to
the cubic inch in milk."
THE FATHER: “Not at all, surprised , my boy.
Everything is dreadfully overcrowded nowa-
days."
Parisine ” mentions a resurrection :
M. Lolifee, essayist and critic, gives two pages of a re-
cently-published book to the Countess Chabrillan, who
made a Melbourne sensation in the generation before
last. She was formerly La Mogador, the Can-can dancer
of the Jardin Mabille. Chabrillan was on the staff of the
French Embassy in Vienna when he met her. His mar-
riage cost him his job, which was a tragedy, as he had no
private means. After a while Napoleon HI. appointed
him first Consul in Melbourne, and the Countess came to
Australia with him. But her Mogador reputation fol-
lowed her, horrifying the wowsers of the period, and the
couple had to clear. She wrote a scandalous autobio-
graphy, which shocked even Paris. Yet it is said that
she could not read or write when she was married. She
was, nevertheless, a superior woman of her class ; Dumas
Fils only condescended to speak to three of them, and
she was one, and from her he got some valuable informa-
tion at times.
“ Pressman,” on behalf of the craft
McGowen will no longer be able to complain of getting
too little newspaper space. He will get enough ; but the
Lord help those who have to “ take ” him, and preserve
them from charges of misreporting. For McGowen
is the most slovenly public speaker in the world ; if he is
not, I’d like to shoot the other. Half his sentences are
never finished, and his remarks trail round and round
his subject like a snake in a hen-coop looking for the
exit. His constantly-repeated “gag” is: “The point I
want to make, Mr. Speaker, is this.” Then he suddenly
discovers that he has mislaid the point, or left it at
home, or in the tram or somewhere, and, while
he is trying to recollect what he did with
it, he fills in time by rounding off a flock of
sentences which he left unfinished earlier in the evening.
Apart from that, there is one tip I can give McGowen
that will win him something : Do not bark and bite at
pressmen for policies over which they have no control;
and remember that they are not in the business for fun
or personal spite. That is where Wade made a fatal mis-
take, the full effect of which he will never learn. He
was quite inconsiderate, possibly through thoughtless-
ness, and often he seemed obsessed with the idea that
newspaper reporters who were waiting upon him were
flunkeys. Unfortunately, Labor generally looks upon
the working pressmen of the Tory dailies as spies and
“scabs,” and if McGowen allows that feeling to creep
into his relations with the press gang, with which he will
now be so closely associated, he’ll be the loser. I’d
sooner have the Devil for an enemy than a good press-
man. The Devil is problematical, but the pressman is
dead sure.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Deakin yesterday stated the case fully and freely
against the Referendum Bills. It was done in a very
broad, comprehensive and voluminous speech. ... It
was an occasion when an orator could enjov himself in
an intellectual ramble. And really Mr. Deakin took
occasion by the hand, and gambolied over the widest
area, uncontrolled by any cramping sense of relevancy.—

Yer reely can’t ’elp likin’ Alf—’e’s smart, there’s no

S.iy what yer mean and get t’ work. We’ll give yer half-

Talk plain and let the d—d speech slide—there isn’t

That can’t be said in ’arf-a-mo ; so stop your jawbones

But, lumme, poor old Alf would die if you talked that

A bank’s balance-sheet, like most other balance-sheets, is

and there is no finality about it. Sometimes the manage-
ment is quite wrong, as most of them were, for instance,
in 1892. Practically no bank shows what it thinks were
the actual profits for the term ; it equalises things by
working on an internal or hidden reserve. It is an old
question whether a bank ought to do this or not. In
theory a lot can be said against it; in practice, however,
it vyorks out fairly well. The trouble is that, if a bank
which has been doing well suddenly showed a great slump
in profits, through one or two big losses which were
really made perhaps years before, quite unneces-
sary alarm might easily be created, and great
damage be thereby done. What the honest Board
is bound to do in its published statements is to give a
faithful indication of the general trend of things. And
there is no doubt that in the Colonial’s case the general
trend indicated is upward.
The Colonial Bank had its serious troubles,
which handicapped it heavily for many years. And the
bank that isn’t doing well and making a brave show
receives little mercy. The public, unfortunately,
looks chiefly to see what dividend a bank is
paying ; most people, it seems, would really prefer to
do business, either as borrowers or lenders, with
a bank which is paying a big dividend rather than
with one which is paying a small dividend, but is putting
by a vastly greater sum rban the other. Now you can’t
have your profit and eat it too ; and in paying a big
dividend in proportion to its profits, the Colonial rather
starved its visible reserves, so that even now they
amount to only about one-third of the capital. That
puts a big dividend out of the question now and for many
years to come. A bank whose reserves are as big as
its capital need only make 6 per cent, all round to pay a
12 per cent. div. A bank like this, whose reserves are
only a third as big as its capital, would have to make 9
per cent, all round to pay a 12 per cent. div.
Still the bank no doubt attracted business, and
especially deposits, by putting up its dividend fate
higher than was otherwise justified. Ten years ago
its deposits totalled £2,113,528; they now amount to
£3,493,696, an increase of about 66 per cent. In that
same period the liquid assets have moved up from £701,614
to £1,392,434, an increase of nearly 86 per cent. The
bank has, therefore, certainly strengthened its position.
It is not extraordinarily strong even now ; but it has 36
per cent, of its liabilities represented by liquid assets,
and that is not a record to make any complaint about.
Its last 12 months’ record is unusually good

It has thus got in £466,735 more of the public’s money,
and it has £351,854 of it in cash or public securities and
the like. That means a larger capacity for resisting sudden
shock ; but it also explains the shrinkage in profits cal-
culated on combined capital and reserves :

Sept., 1908.. 719 3 ~ Sept., 1910.. 8 0 9,,
The drop 12 months ago was due to defalcations, by
which the 00. lost £3600 ; and the fact that the co.
showed just about that much shrinkage might be taken
as a hint that the bank hasn’t got anything much in the
way of an internal reserve to come and go on. If it
hasn’t it ought to be some years before it puts its
dividend any higher. Its own capital in the business is
equal to only £1 for every £6 12s. of the public’s; and
that is a pretty large risk, especially as 64 per cent, of all
the money is in securities that are liable to shrinkage.
A steady and substantial growth of reserves is, therefore,
very desirable.

This bank isn’t doing any sky-rocket business. It did
some of that 20 years ago, and the stick hurt when it
came down. The management probably didn’t think the
wound was as bad as it really was; anyhow-, the
co. didn’t write off enough, and for a good many years
afterwards the securities were over-valued, and the
alleged capital didn’t exist. The management, however,
instead of writing-down both sides of the balance-sheet
further, went in for a course of nursing; and 10 years
ago, and for a good period thereabouts, the dividend was
only 2£ per cent. Even now the £6 10s. shares are
quoted at only £5 55., which is the market’s way of saying
that, not only are there no reserves, but the bank
has still about £87,500 of lost capital to make up some-
how. Still the market isn’t allowed behind the counter
to see what the assets really are worth; all
it can go on is the dividend paid and (to
some extent) the profit disclosed. It is quite
possible, though, that the dividend paid by this bank
doesn’t do it full justice. As before remarked, the Royal
of Queensland had a bad time once, and it doesn’t want
the same thing twice ; wherefore it is obviously going for
safety nowadays. Thus it has 45 per cent, of its liabili-
ties in cash or liquid assets : it owes altogether £1,440,242,
and it holds £645,783 in coin, etc. Further, its own
capital and reserves represent £1 for every £2 Bs. of
the public’s money in the business ; that is to say, in
proportion to its own funds, it has the use of
less than one-half as much public money as Aus-
tralian banks have on the average. True, the capital
and reserves may not be wholly intact. But if the ad-
vances and premises are worth only Xls. in the £ of their
book value, they, with the coin, etc., in hand, could pay
the whole of the debt to the public. The position is ex-
traordinarily strong. The foundation seems good enough
to carry another million of deposits and another three-
quarters of a million of advances without calling for any
hostile remark. Probably the bank could get the deposits.
The trouble is that it can’t get the money out on securities
that seem good enough. People in Queensland simply
don’t want the money; and, apart from the London
office, this bank has no branches outside Queens-
land. Under the circumstances the question arises
whether money in Australia will not have to get
cheaper. If banks can’t let it out at current rates, then
they may have to try whether they can’t do it at some-
what lower rates ; and that will mean something less for
deposits. If this coming harvest pans out well, it seems
almost certain that that reduction will arrive. Mean-
time, as indicated above, the Royal of Queensland has the
financial foundations on which a much larger business
may be done, when the conditions are favorable.

up in the safe ; wherefore the interest return for the
past half-year shows a bit better than for the corres-
ponding half of 1909. In the next list profits are calcu-

This was one of those Melbourne breweries which found
out that the competitive system isn’t all it is cracked up
to be—that competition may be the soul of trade, but
if the competition isn’t checked, the soul is in great
danger of getting lost and going to perdition. Conse-
quently tile cos. decided to use a little common-sense
and leave off clawing at one another’s eyes. The com-
bine was the result. It played ducks and drakes with
the look of this co.’s figures for a start. Thus the co.’s
beer-factory wasn’t wanted; so the co. grabbed oppor-
tunity by the hair, and wrote £29,029 off that and other
property items. Then, as it already had a bit of a deficit,
it decided to straighten things up by writing down its
shares from 255. to 17s. 6d. (£46,875). There was other
writing-down ; and in place of the values thus reduced,
£76,875 was dropped in among the assets to represent
the value of the co.’s holding in the combine. Nominally
this co.’s holding in that concern is worth £102,500 ; but
£25,625 was written off, or set aside for possible depreci-
ation. This shows the movements better:—

Breweries, etc., stock and plant were in 1907 valued at

stock, plant, etc., has been sold ; but most of the old
value has just been written off, and the before-mentioned
£76,875, representing the co.’s interest in the combine
has been put in its place.
The combine is more than a bundle of cos. which
have arrived at an honorable understanding. It is a
co. which has actually acquired those breweries that
were judged to be most suited to the job of keeping Mel-
bourne moist. It took over the plant, etc., which it
wanted, besides certain rights to purchase hotels owned
by the. various cos. It is open to competition, of course ;
in fact, a co-operative brewery has had a beer-mill going
for three or four years. But there is no visible danger of
a burst-up, such as may easily happen where there is only
a vend or an’oriible understanding. In the combine’s
first year it paid 6 per cent. In the second it paid only
3 per cent, (it passed a div. in the second half of the year
on account of costly factory improvements). For the
past year it appears to have paid something over 8 per
cent.

Besides the income from the combine, the Oastlemaine
Go. last year received £5687 from rents; and that paid
all interest (including interest on debentures) and up-
keep. The debentures are secured by a mortgage over
the assets and the uncalled capital (ss. per share) ; and
to put the co. in a position of greater safety, a deben-
ture sinking fund is now being built up. In the table on
top of these remarks this fund (now £10,610) is included
with the reserves. The paid share capital is £78,125 ;so
each 1 per cent, extra paid by the combine is worth just
over 1J per cent, to this co.

Originally there was a Newcastle Permanent Investment
and Building Society ; but, like a good many other things
that are supposed to be permanent, it didn’t live up to
the label on the bottle. In 1896 it found that its building
society business had just about petered out, and that its
assets consisted almost entirely of properties which
had been thrown on its hands. A reconstruction was,
therefore, decided upon ; a new co. was formed, and a
big slice of the capital of the old one was turned over to
a contingency fund. This latter fact accounts for the
size of the reserves of the present co.; for of the £51,892
no less than £39,980 is to the credit of this inherited
fund. As properties are sold and prices under book
values are realised, the losses are deducted from
this contingency fund ; and the size of it after
15 years suggests that things haven’t turned out
so badly as they were expected to. Still, the co. has
some distance to go yet; it has, even now, £61,685 of
properties (book value) in possession. In 1900 the total
was £101,243, and the contingency fund was £45,365. As
the total is now' £61,685 and the contingency fund is
£39,980, it seems that, in realising £39,558 of property,
plus whatever may have fallen into the co.’s hands
meantime, a net loss of £5385 has been made and charged
to the fund. In the same proportion the loss on the re-
maining £61,685 would be about £B3OO. But the rule
of three isn’t infallible in a case of this kind. Ten years’
history can be further followed from this: —

The co. is pushing its advance business ahead, and as it
doesn’t appear to be doing much lately in the way
of sales, it has to borrow the money that it is
lending. To pay for the extra risk the co.
ought to show bigger profits ; if it can only
show the old profits, then, in view of the extra risks,
the position isn’t as good as it was. The rent re-
turn is pretty small—scarcely more than 5 per cent.—
and that explains why so little is put by after paying a
moderate dividend, and in spite of the big reserves which,
of course, ought to help the co. towards big dividends.
The low return hints that either the book values of the
properties are a good deal beyond market values or there
is a good deal of unproductive land among the assets ;
and the law doesn’t tend to make things any easier for
the holder of land that is simply lying idle, waiting for
the community to do something to give it a bigger value.

This used to be the Federal Building, Land and Invest-
ment Society, Ltd., and it was something' extra in the
way of disaster. Its capital used to be £148,398, in £1
shares; but 7s. fid. was written off, and in the struggle
to get in calls about 60,000 shares were forfeited.
In 1908 the improvement in Queensland’s outlook,
the gradual getting-in of capital, and a long
course of no-dividends and hard economy succeeded be-
tween them in hatching out the idea that the co. might
now do better if it swept up the signs of the old trouble
and threw them overboard. At this time the capital
that remained alive was £44,589. The shareholders de-
cided to take half of this in shares and half in deferred
debentures, the latter ranking after the share capital as
well as after the liabilities to the public. The present
capital is, therefore, £22,294 in 44,589 shares of 15s. paid
to 10s.; but the debentures have been reduced to
£16,798, the balance having been swapped for land. The
properties remaining on hand tiow are valued at
only £17,476, exclusive of the Queen-street premises
(£6000). The balance of the capital and the deposits and
other liabilities are chiefly represented by loans and other
advances (£52,964) and balances owing on purchases
(£11,885). The liabilities are still heavy. They total
£54,796, besides the debentures (£16,789). As mentioned
above, the capital is £22,294, with a few pounds more
paid in advance of calls. This means pretty large risks for
the share capital, which, of course, has to protect all the
borrowed capital, and stand the whole racket of slumps in
the value of all assets. The directors ought to aim at a
substantial reserve fund, therefore; in fact, if they are
looking forward to a bigger advance business, and pro-
pose to accept more deposits to do it with, the sooner
some of the uncalled capital is got in the better. No
doubt the creditors are protected by the debentures as
well as by the capital. But the debentures have been re-
duced, and the directors will no doubt go on reducing
them when they can And holders who will take unpro-
ductive properties in exchange for the paper.

So the profit for the half-year was £ll2B, notwithstand-
ing that the co. was laid up by a little strike during the
last two months. Nothing, it is true, has been written
off against depreciation or wear and tear; but £1307
spent on the main tunnel has been charged to working
account, and not to development or capital account. The
co. has had a heap of bad luck, and has put out about
£175,000 worth of coal without making a penny of profit
for the shareholders. True, some interest has been paid
on debentures and overdrafts ; but that hasn’t buttered
the shareholders’ parsnips. Also, so far as the ordinary
shareholders are concerned, they have had to allow
£20,844 of pref. capital to come in ahead of them. There
is, nevertheless, a gleam of light for the co.; for the seam
has been behaving rather better lately. The debentures
now outstanding total £2500 ; and there are other debts
amounting to £4272.

There was an unusual growth of advances in 1908-9, and
that no doubt accounts for the extra profits. Twelve
months ago the contributing capital was £13,439 ; the
bulk of these shares have now paid themselves right up,
and the present capital is—contributing, £2649 ; paid,
£31,800. The liabilities amount to only £5311 —deposit
money. Naturally under the circumstances the
profits are not large. Still the risks are not large either ;
if the society doesn’t make any profit out of handling
other people’s money, it at least doesn’t risk making any
losses by putting it into rotten securities—which is a
negative sort of virtue for a financial co. to own. Besides
the £32,858 of advances on building-society terms, the
society has t'7559 of other loans outstanding. These
entries in the balance-sheet are followed by a note: “The
foregoing are the amounts at which the securities
stand in the society’s books,” and that smells like
foreclosures, and probably explains the steady little loss
on sales. Altogether there is nothing exciting about the
society, and on present appearances there isn’t likely
to be.

Nicholson and Co., Ltd., music-sellers, etc. (Syd-
ney), have issued an interim balance-sheet as at Sept. 30,
along- wit h a circular to shareholders. The present co. was
formed about three years ago, but the shares only got on
the market about IS! months later. In the year to March,
1910, a profit of £6087 was made, of which £3446 was
divided (10 per cent.) and £2Ol written off. For the past
half-year a profit of £4310 is shown, of which £147 is written
off. The directors’ “circular’’does not state what dividend
is proposed ; but the meeting decided on 10 per cent.
The paid capital is £50,000, so the six months’ net profit
is at the rate of £l6 13s. percent, per annum. Ten per
cent., assuming that the £50,000 carried the full six
months’ div., would leave £1663 to add to reserves,
bringing them up to £10,450—a very excellent result
seeing that during the greater part of the co.’s
brief life the capital was only about £30,000.
The business has increased faster than the capital,
and on September 30 there was an overdraft
of £15,779, besides sundry debts totalling £10,400. This
money and the shareholders’ funds are represented by
hire agreements, £53,173 ; stock, £27,470 ; ordinary book
debts, £5807; and a few sundries. The business is
chiefly, or, at any rate, very largely, time-payment ; but
there is probably less risk in it than there seems to be on
a surface view'. The worst that is liable to happen is a
slump in payments and a wholesale return of instruments
and that wouldn’t be all disaster, especially if numer-
ous instalments had been paid. The co. started on a
good footing ; the business was old-established, yet there
is no goodwill item in the accounts. Probably, though
old, to make it a success the business wanted good
financial handling ; and, in that case, it seems to have
found what it wanted.

Mention was made lately of the proposed issue
of unallotted shares in the Metropolitan Accident, Fire
and General Insurance Co. (Sydney). The weak point
disclosed then was the existence of 15,000 paid £1 shares,
which had been passed over to the Australian Metro-
politan Life Assurance Co. for the goodwill of the busi-
ness—and it was a very small business too. This trouble
has been got over to some extent; for the co. has agreed
that for 10 years the rate of div. on these shares shall not
exceed 3£ per cent. ; moreover, this dividend is neither
preferential nor cumulative. In return for these shares
the life co. allows the fire and general co. the use of its
staff and organisation. The idea is to encourage the in-
dustrial and other life canvassers to pick up fire and
general lines as they go along, and there ought to he
something substantial in that scheme.

Twelve thousand reserved Dunlop Tyre cumu-
lative preference shares were sold by auction in Melbourne
the other day. E. L. and C. Baillieu snapped up 4500 ;
J. Goodall and Son got 3500 ; Knox, ex-M.H.R., bought
3000 ; and the other 1000 passed in equal portions to
W. L. Baillieu and Tolhurst, Keats and Gumming. The
sale, which realised £23,162, at prices ranging from 38s.
to 38s. 10Jd., was considered to be about the smartest
on record. It only lasted 13 minutes, and the shares
almost took fire from the speed with which they changed
their owners.

The sharebroking fraternity is chuckling again.
The prospectus of the North Sydney Brick and Tile Co.,
capital £85,000, was issued a fortnight ago. Applications
for shares were to he forwarded “to the managing
directors at the offices of the co.” One can guess what
happened—or, rather, what didn’t happen—from the
fact that a few days ago the prospectus was withdrawn.
The broker is a middleman, of course, and a person
who in theory produces nothing and ought to get work ;
but in practice the broker who is worth his salt
is available as a financial adviser to his clients as well as
a broker. The promoter who asks for applications direct
may save a commission ; but a good many investors,
rightly or wrongly, take it as a hint that the promoters
are not too keen on the proposition having the scrutiny
of people who are at least supposed to be more or less
experts at finding out what prospectuses are stuffed with.

At a meeting the other day proud reference
was made to the ancient charter of incorporation granted
to the Bank of N.S.VV. by Governor Macquarie in 1817.
There is a misconception about that historic document.
It is true that Macquarie granted a charter, and that the
charter was renewed by Governor Brisbane ; but neither
Governor had any authority to do what he did, and the
document was as valueless as if it had been granted bv
Che man in the street. The bank went on blindly for
about 10 years, and when its rieketty foundation - was
pointed out, depositors began to inquire. The Lank
appealed to Lord Bathurst at the Colonial Office; In-
in due time let it know that its charter wiß
waste paper, and advised the directors to get into a legal
position promptly. But by this time the bank had grown
afraid of a rush of depositors, and it applied to Darling,
who was then Governor, for a loan of £20,000 in specie.
Darling sent Government officials to examine the bank’s
books, and, finding the assets satisfactory, though coin
to meet a sudden inflow of notes was deficient, he ad-
vanced the £20,000, and thus staved off a catastrophe.
After that the shareholders were formed into a joint
stock co., and a Court of Proprietors was convened. But
during the first 10 years of its life the Bank of N.S.W.
lived and worked on two pieces of waste paper, and
would probably have gone under had not Governor Dar-
ling come to its assistance.

The chief concern of Southern Cross (W.A.) is
to cater for the stream of visitors going to look at the-
Bullfinch country, or the New Golden Mile, as the Cross
calls it. The Bullfinch itself looks all over a winner, but
so far nothing of any real value has been reported from out-
side it. The owners of leases mostly employ' their time
on top, spying for likely buyers. The boom is, however,
causing prospectors to push further afield, and already
small rushes have occurred at various points, so Southern
Cross is having the time of its life.
The Bullfinch itself is about 23 miles north-west
of Southern Cross, and is easily reached. In the neigh-
borhood, there is plenty of timber but little water, though
the Government is now sinking dams. The aspect of the
country is not too encouraging for gold, and it was the
lucky sighting of some loose outcrop or shed specimens that
attracted notice. When the earthy covering is cleared
the country is found to be mainly greenstone schists,
greatly faulted by intrusions of granite. It is these in-
trusions which have led to the secondary enrichment of
an old ore channel ; and outside the faulted zone
it is not likely that much, if any, of the rich ore will
be found. The earlier or unenriched body, where
seen, is poor. The faulted zone is estimated
to go for about a mile and a half, running a few
degrees west of north. The ore is nearly 60 per
cent, iron oxide, and carries a little sulphur. It is proving
a somewhat refractory roasting proposition, and may
turn out to need smelting, though ordinary analysis
gives no indication of any lurking metallurgical diffi-
culty. Anyway, Doolette and party have got enough in
sight to cause them pleasant visions, whatever "may
happen to the shows immediately outside the large block
held by them.
Government Geologist Maitland has visited the
show, and the Minister of Mines has sent an official mes-
sage to the London newspapers on the strength of the
report. Mr. Maitland states, in effect: No. 1 shaft: No.
1 bulk assay, 100 ft. level, 10ft. to 12ft. of ore, 21oz. 3dwt. of
gold per ton; No. 2 sample, from wall at 100 ft., 2oz.
4dwt. 6gr. per ton. No. 2 shaft (140 ft. from No. 1 shaft):
From 50ft. level, over 16ft. of ore, 33£0z., 4oz. 13dwt. 3gr.
and 151 oz. sdwt. 12gr. respectively. On this statement
of the case the Minister of Mines wired to London
through Reuter’s: “ The Mines Department reports the
Government Geologist has just returned from a visit to
the Bullfinch leases, situated about 20 miles N.W.
of Southern Cross, on the Yilgarn goldfield. So
far as he could judge from the limited amount
of work done and the short time available for
inspection, the prospects of the mine are bright. A
bulk sample taken by him from No. 1 shaft, 100 ft. deep,
gave a return on assay of over 21oz. per ton, the forma-
tion being apparently about 24ft. wide. Another sample
taken from the wall of the same shaft gave a return of
2oz. 6dwt. per ton. From No. 2 shaft, 50ft. deep, three

The Bigelow Patent Rock Breaker commends
itself to mine managers who welcome an effective
machine which is cheaper to maintain and repair than
Gyratory and other crushers. This machine is of the
well-known Blake type, but has some additional improve-
ments which have justified in practice all the claims
advanced by the patentee. The work of crushing is done
on the down-stroke of the pitman instead of the up-
stroke ; there is no strain on the pitman cap ; two large
side rods resist the thrust of the toggles, and enable the
jaws to be regulated within a large range ; the back
toggle is so made as to resist all legitimate strains of
crushing, but will shear under exceptional conditions
and save the machine. The shaft and eccentric bearings
are self-lubricating ; the jaws are convex and concave,
and with the cheek plates are made of steel and are
reversible. The Austral Otis Engineering Company, of
South Melbourne, have installed a great number of these
machines, and hold the sole manufacturing rights for the
Commonwealth.* [3

Mine managers when requiring air compressors
either belt, steam, or electrically driven, should not fail
to inspect the Reavell Air Compressor, when they will be
impressed by its simplicity, compactness and portability.
Owing to the working parts being entirely enclosed it can
be placed to work on any part of the mine, either on the
surface or underground. The number of repeat orders
which Messrs. Reavell have received from the mining
community proves how greatly their compressor is
appreciated. The representatives for Australia are

Mainly on the strength of Maitland’s report,
Adelaide has taken on a new fancy ; and, despite local
appeals to the ’tothersiders to refrain from buying claims
without titles or a hand’s turn done on them, the flotation
business proceeds merrily, not to say recklessly. Taken
altogether, the country is a treacherous gamble. The
shafts may or may not strike the faulted zone, the
chances being against cutting into a secondary enrich-
ment.

A month ago shares in (Vic.) were at
a third of their to-day’s market value. The manager’s
half-yearly report is held to supply the reason ; but, no
matter what the market says, The Bulletin can’t find
justification therein for to-day’s prices. Bryant admits
to 1650 fathoms, equal to three months’ work, in sight;
and he admits that the dirt at. Nos. 9, 10 and 11 rises is
almost worked out. Then he says that there is a large
area opened up in the west end, “provided the tvash
keeps payable, as the ground there is practically all dry.”
Next, in summing up the general merits of the’property,
he toots : “ I have no hesitation in saying your property
is still a valuable one, and with the east and west ends
you have practically a mile of the lead undeveloped." The
balance-sheet shows that £14,618 has been furnished as
capital by shareholders, and £91,208 has come from gold, or
a total of £1u0,826. Against this the dividends amount to
£19,781, all of which have come since the inauguration of
tne Dodd-Bryant rbgime. Shares stood at 18s. the other
day, giving a value to the mine of (say) £45,000. It then
bad 1650 fathoms proved, with the possibilities indicated
by the mine manager of a mile of lead “undeveloped.”
Seeing that the mine since its inception has yielded
under £20,000 profits from £91,000 of gold (and this fails
to take in a reconstruction), it can be affirmed that the
prospects of anyone getting 18s. per share back in profits
are about as remote as the North Pole. The Oathcart lead
has been shown to be a narrow run of wash, rich through
slugs of gold, and costly to work. More than that, the
co. must have a new shaft ahead of it down the lead, and
it has no real guarantee that the wash is payable up the
lead. It is’a fair mining hypothesis to assume that it
should be ; but still that has to be proved.

According to a report from Kalgoorlie, Doolette,
by far the biggest holder in the Bullfinch, has refused an
offer of £200,000 for the property; Lionel Robinson, of
London, was the man who held out the tempting bait.
Shalloross, the well-known mining man, used to have an
interest in the show, but sold out. Later on he bought
hack J-16th for £lO,OOO. The fever has, however, got
worse since then.

The I van hoe (W.A.) ore reserves as at June 30
showed a drop in grade, the management estimating the
value at 44/10, while the consulting engineers put it at
45/8 per short ton, compared with 45/8 and 45/10 respec-
tively in December last. Here is a comparison of the last
w half-yearly estimates: —
Tons (short). Value. Grade.
June, 19QS .. 914,470 £2,325,955 60/10
Dec., 1908 .. 934,089 2,321,066 49/8
June, 1909 .. 963,797 2,327,348 48/3
Dec., 1909 .. 1,007,798 2,303,108 45/8
June, 1910 .. 1,024,670 2,296,933 44/10
It is curious that the consulting engineers’check figures,
which in earlier years were below the mine manage-
ment’s estimate, are now getting above it.
An analysis of'the figures of the various lodes
shows that the big falling off has come in the east lode,
the richest shoot along the belt. The figures run :
Tonnage. Grade. Value.
June, 1908 .. 546,805 60/2 £1,371,821
Dec., 1908 .. 593,446 49/3 1,463,438
June, 1909 636,398 46/9 1,488,067
Dec., 1909 .. 701,544 44/6 1,561,141

The new lode and the Boulder lode keep about the same
grade, but the middle lode, which gives some big supplies
to the mill, has dropped from 61s. 9d. per ton in 1908 to
475. 2d. per ton this half-year. With this there are also
signs of the mill overtaking the ore supplies, as there is a
slight falling off in tonnage. There is one consolation—
the estimates of Ivanhoe reserves, so far as quantities go,
have proved reliable. The increase in tonnage and the
reduction of grade will have their influence on costs, and
l he old rate of dividends will be in the balance this com-
ing year.
* * # *
The Kalgurli (W.A.) reports that it has in sight
an approximate 400,000 tons, worth 555. 3d., as against
575. 2d. at the last statement. The manager says that,
roughly speaking, he has developed as piuch ore as has
been crushed since last report; but there is a deficiency
of 30,000 tons not accounted for. Still, as he leaves out
all the ore developed below 1550 ft.—they are now work-
ing at the 1800 ft. level—and also the ore found in the
prospecting work at the 100 ft. level going south, there is ,
nothing to be anxious about. The drop in grade is the
chief feature ; but the ore is still well above the payable
limit.
* •* * *
The 1900 ft. level of the'Lake View (W.A.)
-eems likely to provide some surprises. Ever since it
was started there have been pickings of rich ore, and, the
last week or so, something more than a patch has been
opened on in a winze below the level. A value of 565.
over 90 inches at- 88ft. deep looks well, while at 54ft. a
crosscut shows 85s. per ton for 6ft. arid 265..6d. per ton
for the next 9ft. Boreholes at 76ft. give 255. over 6ft.,
and a borehole at 83ft. showed 365. for 6ft. The find
looks more substantial than any reported for some time.
* * * *
Perseverance (W.A.) did better with its new
mill during September, and showed a service of 18,952
tons for £23,435, or 245. Bd. per ton. It is reckoned on
the mine that the mill can do better still, and costs may
come down. Costs show up—Mining, 6s. lid. per ton,
against 7s. 6d. last September; treatment, 10s. lsd.,
against 10s. 6d. ; general exes., Is. 6d., against 9d. per ton
with the old mill. The most noticeable feature is the
difference in the grade. The old mill left off with 295. lOd.
a ton. The new one sets out on ore worth 245. Bd., and
it is more likely to keep at the latter figure than to creep,
up to the first-named. The policy will be to keep the
grade low and go for tonnage with small profit, trusting
to fortune to give a few rich shoots occasionally as a
bonus for shareholders.

The Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) is to be inspected
shortly by one Russ, a French examiner of mines, who
lias been commissioned by French shareholders to tell
them in their own language what is the matter with the
mine. During September the mill treated 23,414 tons
for £33,743—an average of a fraction over 6dwt. This is
still a long way from the average stated in the last esti-
mate of reserves. The latest excuse for the returns is
that “slide zones” have interfered more than ever was

Since the in vestigation into the causes of miners
complaint, there has been far less eagerness to get on to
the machines in the Golden Mile mines. The result is a
likely shortage of drillmen,’while shaft men are already
at a premium. # *
The Westralian dividend duties case, in which
most of the Golden Mile cos are interested m o be
taken to the Privy Council ; which, incidentally, will pro-
vide a tour for Keenan, M.L.A., member for Kalgoorhe
and solicitor to the Chamber of Mines. The
contends that when a co. distributes a dividend and does
not deduct income tax from the amount paid to each
shareholder, it is giving the shareholders an illegal
benefit. The cos. say that, if they pay the tax in a bulk
sum out of profits, they are doing their duty by the law and
robbing nobody, and so the case rests. The Government
has so far won' all along the line ; but, as there is a great
amount of money at stake, and both sides have a full till,
the Privv Council is to say a word on the matter. If tms
is against the cos. there will be an agitation to change
the law, and there is a pretty strong feeling that there is
horse-sense this time in the Fat people’s contention,
whatever the law may be.

Kyloe (N.S.W.) has got the lode at the No. 5
level. Its width is 27in., and its value estimated at 11
per cent. The width may be disappointing ; but Kyloe
lode—especially the rich portion—is very erratic. Within
a few feet of the shaft at No. 4 level it varied from 24in.
to 60in. The value is, however, all right.

In a run of 185 hours Main Ridge Deep Lead,
’ Rockley (N.S.W.), treated 152 loads of wnshdirt for 70oz.
gold This is approximately 365. per load, which should
pav well. The co. has adopted the Victorian system of
reporting the quantity of washdirt in square fathoms.
This lot of dirt came from the eastern section of the
workings, which has been of fair quality. According to
the report furniched by consulting engineer Blakemore,
the co. will have to speed up with development to keep
the mill going. But shareholders will probably not
relish spending £4OOO on dead work. The best course
might be to let the mine on tribute to a party of miners.
Things have been brisk at Newcastle since the
labor trouble ended early in the year. All stocks had
been used up, and, besides supplying current wants,
these reserves had to be replenished ; further, many
users (the railways, for instance) decided to get in larger
reserves than they used to keep. This extra rush has
now eased off, and there are Northern mines which are
working only two or three days a fortnight. The
McGoWen Government is going to have a tough proposi-
tion to handle at Newcastle.

Adelaide, which went cold on its tin-prospecting
ventures in N.S.W., has been warmed up by the Bull-
finch excitement; and it has decided to keep going at
some of them for a while longer. Bullfinch will liven
things up all round. Already Sydney is being invited to
put some money into Dick’s Reward, the claim next door
to the old Mitchell’s Creek (N.S.W.), on the strength of
reports by Savage and Ashcroft and T. VV. Horton.

Hail John Cock, of the Chiltern Valley (Vic.),
and one of the best deep-lead miners in the Common-
wealth ! Hail (again) for having pulled the Chiltern
Valley out of the mud on to the smooth path that should
lead to dividends I What this youngster of 70 years can
do is proved by his making lldwt. dirt carry him through
three months of stress without loss, while a bit of an im-
provement down the lead put him into credit again. The
mine has paid £125,000 in dividends and produced
£650,000 of gold ; and yet all it has is a paltry balance of
£4500 of assets over liabilities, which speaks of poor
policy on the part of the directors. For the past 18
months the lead has been a barren thing. Now it is
established that a length of rapids is being passed where
the gutter is parrow and the dip fast. Beyond this
declivity the lead should resume its normal incline, and
as the old Lock Out tributary should junction at about
the same point, there should be an enrichment of wash.
All of which is wished for John Cock’s sake, so that bis
path may be easy when he enters upon the autumn of his
life—say, 20 or 30 years hence.

Long Thought Of, Rokewood (Vic.), has had a
special spree. True to its title, the claim has been in
the way to make up a reputation for itself for a genera-
tion past. Things move more swiftly in these days of
motor-cars and aeroplanes, and the Long Thought Of is,
therefore, to materialise into a 6dwt. to lOdwt. show. This
looks cheerful, for 6dwt. to lOdwt. dirt spells dividends in a
smiling country-side like Rokewood. When, yearssince,
the boom was’on in Long Thought Of shares, it was
horseback or four-wheelers that brought the shareholders
to feast their eyes on the samples. But with that patch
beaten out, Long Thought Of became a dream, till re-
vived by the toot of the motor-car. In the old days loz.
stone was reckoned on. Now it’s lOdwt. dirt. With
canny North of Ireland men to watch affairs, the
Long Thought Of may, upon its reincarnation, prove to
be better than the wretched mining duffers that blotch
the landscape round Rokewood. But its strength has
still to be developed at the expense of the callpayer.

Star of the East, Sebastopol Plateau, Ballarat,
was sold up the other day for £3OOO. This is the last of a
mine that out of half a million tons of quartz won 250,0000 z.
gold, and paid nearly £1 per oz. in divs. South Star
went the way of all flesh long before ; but the Central
Plateau—the last of the trio—is to be resuscitated.
London capitalists, so it is whispered, intend to try their
luck on the Albion lode. So the sound of stamps may
be heard again on the Plateau. To the shareholder their
beat has for eight years past been as fatal as the wail of
the banshee. One after the other the old hands have
dropped out, leaving only “ Sonny ” Edwards and perhaps
two besides to recall the times when divs. were free,
board fees good, and the special votes to the chairman
more substantial than a memory. Edwards used to run
the Star as a tributing show ; but his successors, the
Sewell-Flowerday combination, went on other lines. The
Bank of Victoria was the Star’s biggest creditor to the
end. But manager Law must have written off the debt
years since, though he clung to his lien over the plant to
the last.

East Mexican, Charters Towers, feels better,
because the end of No. 5 level is showing a brighter pros-
pect. An idea is also growing that, n,ow that No. 5 level has
got past the 400 ft. mark east of the boundary, it will
meet with the reef which branched into the hanging wall,
forming a loop in the Freehold’s levels, in No. 2 (old
No. 7) the loop branched off about 500 ft. from the boun-
dary, and carried good stone until it functioned with the
main level. The Mexican has now proved 100 ft. of pay-
able reef in No. 5 level, and the rise is also reported to be
looking better. Still, values are very inconsistent, as is
shown by the last crushing of 293 tons for an average of
£5 17s. 5d., which is a big drop from the previous £8 per
ton. Nevertheless, as some of the knowing ones ex-
pected a much poorer result, there was a sudden recovery
in the market. Every month’s sinking brings the shaft
50ft. nearer No. 5 level, and the rise is also helping to
bridge the gap. # * *
The Bluff colliery people (Q.) had their 11th
half-yearly meeting the other day. Though not “going
strong,” the co. keeps a pretty bright countenance. The
• total of coal for the half-year ran up to 8301 tons, which
ie 159 tons better than its previous best. The co. sLill
wails for more capital, and in the same breath talks
in millions of tons about its coal deposits. It tacks
its faith to four possibilities—the Bluff itself ; the coke
works there, which, according to the latest accounts,
have at last hatched a small profit ; the Blair Athol pro-
perty, near Clermont, which is alleged to hide a 43ft.
seam ; and, lastiv, the Mammoth seam. It was from the -
Mammoth that the co. sent 55 tons for the Admiralty test,
and got a report that gladdened its heart. A hundred
tons were ordered, but when 55 tons had been raised,
floods came and smothered things, including the
shaft. A new shaft is now asked for by the directors .
to supply the Admiralty’s latest request for 200 tons for a
sea-going trial. It is, the manager says, regrettable
“ that a new and profitable industry should be crushed
for want of capital and, since the Government stands
Sphinx-like in the presence of all requests for dollars, the
directors beg for suggestions as to how to raise the neces-
sary. Meantime, the coke ovens are spelling, and the
wail for more capital echoes dismally among the bricks. .
Oaks Bush (North Queensland) has attracted .
buyers because of the return of 7380 z. from 352 tons.
But the mine has only been prospected in th. shallow
ground above 100 ft., so the reserves are not bulky.
During its short life of between three and four years the
Oaks field has produced 26,0U00z. of alluvial and 62270 z.
of reef gold—the latter from 3736 tons.
* * * *
Kulamadau, Woodlark Island (Papua), has had
a crushing of 730 tons for £2500. This is an improvement
on the previous 1914 tons for £4452 ; and, as there is a
good balance in hand, there should be a Christmas
dividend.
* * * *
Blythe River Iron Mines, Ltd., continues to do
notiiing with tremendous energy. The co. owns certain
very fine iron deposits in Tasmania, and the tew it took
of the value of the property can be judged by the fact
that it has a capital of £500,000, £499,993 of which
(in paper) was issued in exchange for the deposits. The
idea was to erect, or get somebody to erect, works near
Sydney or elsewhere ; but either the time has never been
ripe, or the directors don’t know when time is ripe. Any-
way, nothing has been done—the co. is just waiting, and
using up about £250 a year in exes. But there is still
about £5OOO in hand, and the interest on that amount
pays some of the bill.
* * * *
From Maoriland : The Waihi Co.’s return for
September was published on October 15. A warning bad
been issued by the office, so there was no surprise that
the value was down to £68,744 from 34,951 tons. Total esti-
mate for the year to date is £704,000, Or £17,000 odd less
than for the same period of last year. Driving for the
Empire reef at the 1150 ft. level has been commenced ; it
should be met about 700 ft. from the shaft. Komata
Reef, about 6 miles from Paeroa, issues its return for
September—£2l6B from 800 tons, an improvement of
£489 on the previous month. Waihi Grand Junction has
had £ll,OOO from 7418 tons, being less by £1515 than for
the previous period. Crown, Karangahake, got £2171
from 1719 tons. This is the third return since
operations were re-started in May, and the last
two have each shown a falling-off from the first.
The mine has produced over £750,000 to date.
New Sylvia, Thames, has had 240 tons treated in N. S.
Wales for £1353. It is proposed to have a total of 520
tons treated, and a second parcel of 140 tons was for-
warded on Oct. 3. The Paeroa-Waihi Extraction Co.,
formed to deal with tailings from the Ohinemuri River,
has its works well in hand. The co. had bad luck during
the big flood in the river some months ago, and had to
shift its plant to Paeroa. The value of the tailings is not
high, but it is claimed that re-cyaniding will show a
good profit. Tube mills also will be used.

“The Melbourne committee of the Property
Owners’ Association regards the Land Tax Bill as the
most fatal blow ever given to Australian credit in
London,” says the daily paper. Apparently, to prove it,
the daily paper publishes a few scattered items : —(l)
“ London, Tuesday.—The Australian Pastoral Co. pro-
poses to issue an additional £300,000 stock, ranking
with the existing consolidated ordinary stock, for the
purpose of acquiring 66,000 acres from the Queensland
Estates Co., which will enable the Australian Pastoral
Co. to use southern stations for fattening depdts,
while the stock will be bred further north. The
Financial Times commends the scheme.” (2) “ Bank
of Australasia shares, sold at £ll2 in July,
were in strong demand yesterday at £ll7. Bank of N. S.
Wales have put on £l, and other Australian bank shares
in request.” For a credit that has received a “most
fatal ” blow, this one seems to be doing pretty well.
* * * *
Alfred Gilbert, who for many years managed
things for the old M.L.A., first in Maoriland and then in
England, has formed the London Agency, Ltd., with him-
self as managing director. The idea in general is to push
Australasian business on the other side, and in particular
to represent anybody who wants business representation.
The new co. has a strong Board of Reference, and a large
stock of valuable knowledge of both ends of the earth.

“ Puffing Billy ” attacks some popular ideas
touching the displacement of railways and the consequent
knocking-out of railway securities ‘ Leo Lear’ (B.
8/9/TO) talks much nonsense about monorails ; but
as so many others gabble the same thing, it is
worth while putting the stuff under the acid.
The first cranky notion is that monorail vehicles
will be able to whiz over the tops of mountains,
round surprising curves, across ravines and rivers on a
wire rope, and so forth. There is no particular reason
why an ordinary locomotive should not climb steep
grades, except that it does not pay to do it. The object
of a railway is to shift goods and passengers from place
to place iri safety and at the least possible expense.
There is a one-in-15 grade on a railway here in M.L. (the
Rimutaka incline). It takes three or four fairly powerful
engines to haul a very ordinary train over this grade, and
they take some time to do it. It may he accepted as an
axiom that about the same power will be required to
haul a given load over a given grade, whether it runs
on one rail or on two. ‘Leo Lear’ is up against the
law' of gravity. The advantage, if any, is with the
two-rail outfit,' because each monorail vehicle must have
a set of gyroscopes (to keep it upright), with some kind
of a motor to drive them; and as these things are
weighty, and occupy some space, the load which can be
carried will be proportionately less, and the earnings of
the train ditto.
“As to cost of construction : The grades
would be about the same as on present railways, or
flatter, for the reason given above. The monorail is said
to be able to take sharper curves than a double railway.
But will it pay to have them ? A few of the objections to
sharp curves on an ordinary railway are the w'ear and tear
of rails and rolling stock, the extra power required, and
the liability to derailment owing to the pull being across
the curve while the train has to travel around it. In the
absence of definite data, based upon a long period of
actual experience, it is fair to assume that these
objections would apply with equal force in the case of
the monorail. The monorail would have one rail instead
of two ; but, as it has to carry the weight which is home
by the two rails, it must be twice as strong. The function
of the sleepers is to distribute the weight over a sufficient
area. Their length would therefore be the same in either
case ; but, whereas the two-rail load is supported in two
places, a load carried on one rail would be supported in
one only (the centre), and the sleepers would have
to be made heavier to carry it that way. The width
of cuttings and embankments is governed by the length
of the sleepers chiefly, and would be about the
same in either case. Tunnels are made big enough to
admit the roijing-stoek. They would be about the same.
Wire ropes in place of bridges are out of the question for
many reasons. For instance, it would be impossible to
get, them tight enough. Even properly-constructed sus-
pension bridges are seldom or never used in railway con-
struction.
“ Thus a monorail would be no cheaper to con-
struct than an ordinary railway. The rolling-stock
would cost more. It could carry less with a given ex-
penditure of power. It would hardly be as safe, because
the vehicles would depend for their stability upon the
proper working of the gyroscopes and their motors.
From all of which (and much more) it can be safelv laid
down that the monorail will not immediately necessitate
the scrapping of all existing railways. It may eventually
replace them gradually, but even that is doubtful.”

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney. October 25, 1910.
My Dear Artnt,—
There never was such an opulent prosperous-
looking audience at the Town Hall as that which
crammed it for the concert in aid of the Children’s
Hospital. It was dicolleti down to the anti-organ
door, and to the farthest, draughtiest corner
it had things m its hair—ornaments, I mean.
Diamond combs and posies and remnants
of silk ribbon. You simply don’t know
what a Town Hall audience can look like
until you've seen one decoyed into the net by two
large goldfish of the society pool. Of this pair
one sang and the other played. (My fish sing
and play if it suits me, so no sneers, please,
about confusion of metaphors.) Mrs. Alex.
Gordon was the singer, and Mrs. Ewan Frazer the
piano-player, and the result of their joint work
was £4OO. Nice girls sold programmes at the
doors, and one of the most kindly men in Sydney,
when asked for sixpence for liis, handed over
seven sovereigns. The girl nearly died of a rush
■if triumph to the brain.
Compliments come over the cable. Miss Lily
Drayton has laid on the flattery (and some of it is
doubtful) far more thickly than she put on her
stage make-up. “Australian women are splen-
did, and among the most beautiful in the world,
and their taste in frocking is equal to that of the
Gallic woman.” By these signs ye may know
that we will be asked to consider the Lily once
more. If her second season is as huge a success
as her first, then will the Australian woman be
still more beautiful than she was two years previ-
ously. The Asches have threat* to return in
that time.
A commonplace and sterec -ompliment
about beauty and suitable clu„.. ‘cems to be
expected from noted strangers by the two young
nations, America and Australia. Anyhow, the
bald-with-age assertion is never for long off the
Australian-American cables. It is extracted from
the stranger under pressure of the interviewer, and
the objects of it know that the interviewed
wouldn’t make any other reply even if she, or he,
thought we all resembled and were furred like the
ladies who swung about in trees in the “Before
Adam” yarn.
Of course, Australian women are amongst the
finest in the world. Soare the English, American,
Italian, Spanish, French and Austrian—all the
women of the Caucasian races are amongst the
ifinest in the world. Go to! The first part
■of the compliment sprawls. It applies to
‘too many nations and does no credit to Miss
ißrayton’s insight or originality. The second
part—the individuality in dress—is not true. The
Australian girl frocks and hats herself as fashion-
ably as she may, and looks attractive enough in
her foreign-set fashions ; but her chief concern is
“ What are they wearing? ” not “ Will it suit me
individually ? ”
I had almost forgotten ! The Brayton compli-
ment has four legs to stand on. The Australian
girl cares nothing for convention, and shares her
brother’s pride of his country. As I don’t know
what Miss Brayton means by her use of “conven-
tion,” I won’t take the word on the mat and
worry it. She may mean that Miss Australia
uses the wrong forks at dinner, flouts Mrs.
Grundy, or throws pebbles at the decalogue.
Most of the persons one meets who care nothing
for convention are most undesirable acquaint-
ances. As for the Australian girl’s pride of her
country, probably that is true; but your Akenehi
has met so many Australian women, especially
the travelled ones, who fairly mew with joy if
they are mistaken for Englishwomen that she is
of the Thomas-the-disciple turn of mind with
regard to the pride-of-country question.
Good looks, good dressing and patriotism !
Miss Brayton is strictly conventional in her use
of ingredients. Not a word about the Austra-
lian woman’s appreciation of Shakspeare. As our
women helped to crowd the Brayton houses, they
might be credited with some brains, even if their
culture is not pronounced culchaw.
Socially, N.S.W.’s new Labor Government
should be more acceptable than the outgoing one.
The McGowen Ministry contains quite a number
of pleasing husbands and charming wives. Mr.
Holman, the new Attorney-General, suggests, as
to voice, appearance and manner, the beauty-
actor of the matinee girl’s dream far more
than the prosperity-ruining desperado he is
pictured for electioneering purposes. And
his wife is a bright and alluring person. Mr.
Griffith is a scion of an Irish political family—his
grandfather sat for the city of Dublin in the
British House of Commons—and a University
graduate. He married a hospital nurse possessed
of brains and good looks. And Messrs. Beeby,
Trefle and others, with their wives, should do
Labor proud in the halls of the mighty.
I passed Cranbrook the other day, and, viewing
the mighty pile of stonework that is going up on
the terrace opposite the drawing-room, it struck
me that “Liberalism” had left Labor with, at
any rate, one costly legacy of foolishness. lam
no financier, but the idea of spending £lO,OOO on
Cranbrook appeals to me as ill-advised. It is un-
likely that we shall have our State Governors
with us much longer. We are a utilitarian
people, and the illogicality of paying out a
large sum per annum for services that might
be rendered with equal skill and grace
by the merest mayor is bound to strike the intel-
ligence of a carefully State-educated people
before long. And there is the further considera-
tion that, anyhow, the modern State Governor
does not come here to fling his money about.
Downing-street is taking, latterly, to appoint-
ing State Governors who haven’t any surplus cash
to distribute, even if they are disposed to do so.
Sir Harry Rawson, the most successful, because
the least pretentious and interfering, Governor
that N.S.W. has known in recent years, lived
within the £5OOO a year the State paid him ; and the
Macgregor, of Queensland, is understood to be
making good on the same lines. This regime pre-
cludes the giving of balls to Sydney’s old nobility.
A garden party —a mere tea-and-cake affair—
constitutes no undue drain on the donor’s bank
account. But a big dance is different. At a
moderate estimate, each guest may be expected
to get away with half a bottle of champagne. The
appreciative manner in which Sydney society
punishes champagne, when the same is free, is a
matter of notoriety. An ornate supper must
accompany the outpouring of the juice of the
alleged French grape. Also, hordes of waiters
have to be hired to hand the liquid stimulant
round, and they have dry throats too.
In a word, balls are expensive affairs. Lord
Chelmsford may give a few during his remaining
term of office here; but it is safe to predict that
his successor, if there is a successor, won’t. In
which case this State will have squandered 10,000
hard-borrowed sovereigns, to no more purpose
than the gratifying for a few hours of a couple of
hundred social lights, who are mostly rich enough
to do without State-aided entertainments. To my
mind, the inauguration of a costly new ballroom at
Cranbrook is all the evidence that the non-
political woman needs as to “Liberalism’s” in-
sanelv-squanderous habits. It is as though
King Manoel went out and deliberately sunk his
half-year’s savings in a new Royal Palace at Lis-
bon, even as the Revolutionaries thundered at the
back gate, instead of prudently remitting the bulk
of the cash to the Credit Lyonnais, in Paris, as of
yore.
I note that there’s some suggestion or scheme
afoot for the resurrection of the Bush Nursing
Scheme. Now that we have learnt, on the word of a
visiting tenor, that Lady Dudley’s voice is “some
tiling exquisite,” most of us would pay at least 60
tram fares to hear it. If the lady would give a
dozen recitals in the Town Hall she could fill
that building, not with her voice, perhaps,
but certainly with her lieges. They would come
from—why, goodness gracious me, they’d come
from Jindabyne to hear her ! Scores would pay
five guineas for seats. Supposing she charged a
uniform price of ss. (or 60 tram fares), the Town
Hall holds 4000 (squeezed), and that would mean
£lOOO. Twelve recitals would bring £12,000, and
the Bush Cursing scheme would be well started
in life. Besides, there would be a certain satis-
faction in making Melba and Crossley blind with
jealousy.
If this, lifted from the fashionable annex of a
foreign magazine, be correct, Maoriland has some-
one worth the staring that a Governor’s wife
receives:—
This season London was regretting one of its best
known hostesses, through the appointment of Sir John
Dickson-Poynder, now Lord Islington, to be Gov-
ernor of Maoriland. Lady Islington is one of
the loveliest women in England, in the classic
style, but with more sensitiveness in her face than
always goes with that type. She dresses in exquisitely soft
shimmering things, and uses jewels with great art. Her
dark hair is wavy, and her coloring is very delicate. Her
little daughter Joan was, a couple of years ago, the most
sought after of the bridesmaids in London, on account of
her great beauty. She has wide, grey eyes and curling
hair, a little lighter than her mother’s. Lady Islington
always dresses her very simply, and also brought her up
to great charm of manner, and, which is more important,
to charming manners.
We’ll all be so glad when business or pleasure
brings Lady Islington to Sydney. “ One of the
loveliest women in England” is a large order.
On Saturday, the Dr. Ewan Frazer pair, with
their four children, left by theMalwa. The school-
age infants will be domiciled at Dresden. That fair
china city was Mrs. Frazer’s study-ground when she
was Miss Jessie Middleton, and there she will
chiefly make her home, for some years to come.
She departed behind a barricade of flowers, and
her cabin was so full of them there was no
room for her in it. Mrs. T. H. Kelly, who left
for Bombay and a visit to the Hore Ruthvens,
was also farewelled with flowers—so many of them
that, like the picture puzzle, it was a case of
“ find the lady.”
Mr. Edward Lamb, whose tall, spare figure
was well known about the streets of Sydney,
died last week, aged 83. He was a brother
of Mrs. H. C. Dangar, and father of Mrs.
R. J. Browning and of Mrs. Walter Allen, who
is now in England. His father. Captain John
Lamb, R.N., was one of this State’s first M’sL. A.,
and for half a century or more various members
of the family have been prominent in public life.
Some lady with the attractive name of Ida
Withers, who was hon. sec. of the Bush Book
Club Pastoral, of which Lady Poore was inspira-
tional shepherdess, announces that £3OO was
secured by the Fete. “Good business,” as the
stage-managers say.
Most Sydney women are sorry that Minis-
ter S. W. Moore was amongst the losers. He
lost Bingara by forty votes. The regretful
ones mostly don’t know S.W.M., but they are
acquainted with his wife, who is one of the best-
liked women anywhere, and with his bunch of
uncommonly pretty daughters. One of the
bunch —she still looks quite a girl—is the wife of
Dr. Busby, of Bathurst, and the mother of five
tiny girls. What a fine contingent of sons-in-law
she’ll have in 20 years’ time !
Mr. Percy Spence’s exhibition—a fine and fairly
numerous collection of his pictures—was open for
a few days at his studio in the Equitable Build-
ings lately. His place in the Art world as a
black-and-white man, like good wine, needs no
bush. A number of pictures were sold, and doubt-
less more would have been disposed of had the
exhibition been open longer and its whereabouts
better known.
Writing from London, an Australian girl tells
me that the audience at the first night of “The
Man from Mexico” found the play boresome.
“It did not appeal to the English at all,” she
writes, “although the actors and actresses were,
on the whole, fine. Stanley Cooke is a noted
comedian... You remember how delighted we
were with Hugh Ward’s production of the same
farce? The only times the English laughed were
when Miss Ola Humphrey and Miss Jean Harkness
tried to run. There is a great deal of hurried
exit and entrance in the piece. Its ‘go’ depends
so much on swift side-stepping. Well, Miss
Humphrey and Miss Harkness were fashionably
frocked—that means they had martingales and
hobbles—and the audience rolled in its collective
seat every time the two women tried to hurry. It
is so horrid to be laughed at, so pleasant "to be
laughed with.”
In the music of “ The Chocolate Soldier,” to be
produced in Australia by Meynell and Clarke,
there is a waltz that has put “The Merry Widow”
dance air amongst the cobwebs of forgetfulness.
“Come, come my Life,” is it called. It would
seem that someone of the name of Strauss must
always be king of waltz music-makers.
Nellie Stewart will take but one play—“ Sweet
Nell’’—along with her when she sets out on her
small-town tour in February. Starting from Tas-
mania, she will wind up the reel of the orange
dog-and-king play in the winter in Queensland.
Recent news of Marie Narelle tells of her as
singing at the Eucharistic Conference at Montreal,
and making pots of money through warbling into
gramophones.
Mrs. George Willoughby did not come back to
Australia with her massive consort, and the “Night
of the Party” revellers. Her health was not as
good as it should be, but as the lady is booked to
return here in February, she has plenty of time to
get well enough to look as she used to in the
fashion-plate frocks that Sydney liked to stare
upon. Mrs. Willoughby was a Bathurst girl—
one of the well-known Kennas. If its members
don’t actually go mumming, they marry mimes.
Brown’s the only shade going. Miss Blanche
Browne is still staying at Redleaf—the Lasset-
ters’ place. Mrs. Forbes Angus is doing the
chaperon turn at Redleaf, biding the time Mrs.
L. senior will be here. And the time is nearly
here already.
Westralians who remember the “ Tom Brown
of Australia ” family, mentioned by me a letter or
two ago, will be interested to hear that Miss
Queenie Brown was married quite recently in
Scotland to Mr. Gordon Browne, a Scottish land-
owner with all sorts of rent rolls, at whose house
the girl and her mother had been staying and
golfing. The Browne into whose russet the bride
merged her Brown was not related to the Aus-
tralians. She, by the way, with her mother and
sister, Mrs. Darlot (of W.A.), was on the
Pericles when that vessel foundered some eight
months ago. Of all the crowd in the boat on
which they escaped only the two girls
could handle the oars. Stewards and a few
other males of the party had never touched such
things before. But they took their first lesson,
severe for amateurs, and all met safely on that
beauty-ful shore, as the yim has it, eight miles or
so distant.
The man Miss Ella Caspers is to marry is a
consulting engineer of some note and considerable
scholarship. He was in Brazil when last mail
left. The young singer met him soon after her
arrival in London.
Mr. Dion Boucicault mentions in a note,
phrased as if written with sparkling hock, that
a son has been born to him “the sweetest babe
that ever was.” They have called his name Peter.
Young Boucicault (not the baby) is with Lewis
Waller, and doing well. He hopes to be back in
Australia in a year or so.
Rev. David Arthur, father of Dr. Richard
Arthur, died on Sunday at his Mosman house.
His only daughter is married to an officer in the
Indian military service.
Mrs. Edwin Geach has returned from Maori-
land, whither she had gone on account of her
father’s illness and subsequent death. •
Change and change, meaning, let us hope, pro-
gression. That branch of the A.B.C. foodery
next the Civil Service stores in Pitt-street was
found by its clients on Monday a dismal mass of
bricks, dust and horny-handed toilers. The
Civil Service has acquired it with a view to more
feeding, and the former occupants are to go
higher up Pitt-street.
“ Knowledge by suffering entereth,” says Mrs.
Browning. Well, not necessarily. You get
Farmer’s “Fashion and Facts,” the spring and
summer numbers, and see if you won’t accumulate
a great deal of knowledge with pleasure, not
suffering. And the knowledge purveyed from Vic-
toria House is of the most versatile character. The
Toilet Talks are charming, and there are Travel
Notes, and Musical Memoranda and a guinea-
prize short story. All these make good reading for
a train or ferry journey. But the bulk of the
book is an exposition of current fashion. High-
class fashions in frocks, hats and gift-goods are
illustrated beautifully, and priced so that you may
know at once what the object of your admiration,
whether blouse or sunshade, house or lingerie
frock, will cost. Farmer’s cater for men as
fully as for women. . Possibly not quite as fully,
for man does not wear “willow” ostrich feathers
or long satin scarves ; but, at any rate, the house
has stocked everything a well-dressed man can
want.
“ Miss Mcßae, late of the Grand Hotel, Mel-
bourne. intimates, that she has taken over the
management of the Oriental Hotel, in Collins-
street, and that it is the intention of the directors
that the Oriental shall become the leading hotel
in Australasia in point of comfort for guests.”
Miss Mcßae is hereby wished “good luck. The
Warrigal, best-managed and most satisfactorily-
fooded men’s club in Sydney, is run by a woman.
All parts of the United Kingdom are hurrying
to get “jov-wheels,” and thereby practise “saucer-
slipping.” The first jov-wheel appeared at the
Brussels Exhibition ; nowit has become a craze—
what roller skating and shooting the shoot once
were :
A sort of circus with a padded barrier and tiers of seats
rising all round outside it, has in the centre an inverted
“saucer”of polished wood about four yards in diameter,
the edge raised a foot above the polished floor, which ex-
tends to the barrier.
The joy of the game consists in slipping off the
“saucer.”
In the middle of the “ saucer ” is a small, flat space,
from which to the edge of the circle the curve is very
gentle.
The wheel revolves and the slipping begins.
Slippers get no end of thrills, and the spectators
laugh so much that they grow fat, while they
wait.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.
They don’t believe in “ hasty legislation ”
in Freetrade England. One of the industries
pursued by women in that beautiful land is chain-
making, at which gentle occupation thousands of
women and girls toil naked to the waist, and by
waving heavy hammers for about 10 hours per day
make as much as ss. a week. The Trade Board
recently gave notice that it was proposed to have
a minimum of 2£d. per hour (2s. Id. for a half-
naked woman after she has swung a hammer for
10 hours). But it was provided that the old rate
should last for six months, and after that for
another six months, provided the employers could
get their employees to signify in writing their will-
ingness to accept it. In Cradley Heath alone 500
women were recently locked out and starving be-
cause they wouldn’t “ signify their willingness.”
It is a pitiable case; but, anyhow, “ hasty legis-
lation ” has been averted.
The Man behind the Bank-book is taking
Labor’s successes at the polls badly. Thus a
country exchange:—
At a meeting of the committee of the Ararat Hospital,
held on Tuesday evening, Mr. T. Millear, of Edgarley,
Willaura, forwarded a letter enclosing donations from his
men, and seating that he would not be on the list of
donors. Mr. Millear, who is a life governor of the insti-
tution, gave as his reasons an article in the Labor Call
and the present actions of the Commonwealth Labor
Government.
According to “Liberalism’s” official press, the sup-
porters of “Liberalism ” in N.S.W. buttoned up
their pockets against the Charity Saturday col-
lectors on the day after the downfall—solely as a
protest against “Labor domination.’’ And The
Bulletin now hears of a citizen who intends to
cease contributing to the support of his stone-
broke and bedridden grandmother as a means of
giving a lesson to Mr. McGowen.
On certain occasions the Victorian State
railways make a distinction between footballers
and naval or military travellers—to the advan-
tage of the footballers, of course. Also, they dis-
criminate as regards school boys between the
ages of 14 and 19, vide this table of fares to Gee-
long :
School pupils travelling to take part in athletic
contests .. .. .. .. .. ..2s. lOd.
Cadets .. .. .. .. .. .. ..3s. 7Jd.
The explanation probably is that for the Defence
forces (including cadets) the Commonwealth pays ;
and the Commonwealth is a lamb that ought to be
fleeced whenever the chance offers. Besides, as
everybody knows, football is much more im-
portant from the national point of view than the
mere training of people to defend the country.

“The Heart of The Bush,”
By BRODA REYNOLDS.
Illustrated by H. CARTER.
Price l/» ; Postage 3d.
“ The Heartof the Bush ’’ shows conclusively
that the people of the cities hold no monopoly
of the human passions, for the story teems with
incidents in which love and hate, jealousy and
revenge, weave in and out of the web of
Destiny in such a way as to enthrall the reader
from cover to cover. That this gifted author
has an intimate knowledge of the affairs of the
Bush as well as the affairs of the heart must
be apparent to the most casual observer, and
those of 11s who have either memories of Bush-
land or “just that touch of Nature that makes
the whole world kin,” will revel in the absorb-
ing atmosphere that pervades these pages.
The episodes that culminate in the duel in
Dead Man’s Gully are depicted in language
that leaves no doubt.
"The Lost Echo,'
By JAMES GREEN.
(Author of “The Selector,'’ etc.)
With Four Illustrations by H.J. Carter.
Paper Cover, Price l/=; Postage 3d.
Mainly, this is the authenticated story of
The Richmond written by one who has made
pioneering a close study for many years, and
who brings to his work the charm and glamor
of the born storyteller. Incidentally, we are
treated to some very amusing episodes, and
many gallant tights, both against the fierce
black tribes whose strongholds were being
invaded, and against the mighty forces of
primeval Nature.
Running parallel to these exciting events is
the evergreen romance that gilds the stern
lives of the pioneers as surely as it kindles th,e
hearts of kings, An altogether refreshing
book, true to nature and racy of the soil.

“The Mystery of the Boxing Contest,”
By BERT JAMES. With Four Illustrations by F. J. Scott.
Paper Cover, 1/- ; Postage 3d.
One of the spectators of a boxing contest is mysteriously
murdered as he is leaving the hall, and the unravelling of the
mystery makes one of the best detective stories that has appeared
for many years. As often happens, suspicion falls on an innocent
man who barely escapes the hangman’s rope after his life and repu-
tation have hung suspended by circumstances as slender as a cobweb;
The amateur detective efforts of the middleweight champion to
save his friend are ultimately crovyned with success, and the reader
heaves a sigh of relief when the real culprit is eventually run to
earth. Clever, mysterious, exciting and captivating are adjectives
that but faintly feature this story.

Is this the Piano
for which you have
been waiting ?
WE have been asked many times why, in view of the enormous success of the Upright
Piano containing the Pianola, we did not carry the idea to its highest possible point
of development by incorporating the Pianola in the Grand Piano, tor over six
years we have been laboring on this very problem.
Now that we have the solution in a perfectly natural, simple and artistic form, many more
persons will wonder why such an instrument should not have been produced years ago.
The Steck Grand Pianola Piano, now on exhibition at Pianola Hall, is at once an achieve-
ment and a revelation. One of Australia’s most prominent musicians, who examined this
instrument in detail, exclaimed :
“To say that lam amazed is to put it mildly. I never expected to live to see the day
when you would combine Grand Piano and Pianola so that the result would be entirely
satisfying to both eye and ear.
“ But this is exactly what you have done, and the idea has been carried to a point of
perfection that I had never dreamed possible. It is beyond question the greatest accomplish-
ment the piano world has yet witnessed.”
THE Pianola Company nas always led the way in Piano-player construction.
To-day there are over ninety different imitations of the Pianola, but we are the
first to present a Grand Piano in this form to the Australian Public.
Imitations will now follow, just as they followed the Pianola ; but imitations are
necessarily years behind in principle, and are always inferior in construction.
INFORMAL DEMONSTRATIONS.
To appreciate just how great are the achievements of this new' instrument, you must
see, hear and play it for yourself. The Steck Grand Pianola Piano is continuously on
exhibition at Pianola Hall for the interested as well as the merely curious.
If you are unable to call, we will send you free a catalogue describing this new instrument
more fully. Be sure and ask for Catalogue “ C.”

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 24, 1910.
Air Dear Y.arrie,—
Henley! One thing about it hits harder every
year—the fact that this unique Yarra Day should
be weighted down with a foreign name. Yet
Henley-on-the-Yarra is a characteristic affair, in
spite of its beginnings, and in spite of the invited
comparison that is hurled at a youngster apeingan
elder. The Yarra Henley is eight years old, and
already it marks October as distinctly as the Cup
does November. Faraway in the outer suburbs, on
Henley morning, I saw a big cart-horse with a
dappled grey coat like satin wearing a collar of
pink roses. It was decorated for Henley Day.
People who do not build house-boats or pay for
reserve banks, go to the north bank of the river
and make a day of it—take their lunch, and peg out
theirclaim, and keepjust sitting-room. Everybody,
from house-boat to North Bank, makes appoint-
ments and plans for the evening. At 6 the whole
place is cleared of these thousands; but they flock
back to the fireworks and lights of the evening
in blissful continuance of the carnival. It is pure
holiday spirit all through.
At night the Tait station, dotted over with
lights, proved itself useful for once; it formed a
striking scenic background. The south bank of the
river was gay with house-boats and cool frocks,
crowding slowly below the chains of electric light.
Beyond, the bridge and the striking reflections
of the lamps on the river. And looming up be-
hind, the mass of building—made majestic in the
night. A Londoner said the view of that gloomy
pile across the river beat the boasted view of Par-
liament Houses across the Thames—which was a
far stretch of tongue for a Londoner.
In the day-time the house-boats were prettier
than ever. The Australian Club held to its pale
blue. There was a Governor’s boat, and the Car-
michaels were there for a while; but the G.-G.
Dudleys only arrived in Melbourne by that day’s
express ; so the At Home flag waved gaily from
the tower over the river. Mrs. Lachie McKinnon
and Mrs. George Fairbairn made their usual duet,
hostessing a dainty house-boat crib of their own.
The Athenaeum Club scored for solid and comfort-
able hospitality. It was the biggest and surest
craft on the bank, and motor launches were in
gondola-like attendance at cute little water steps,
to take restless guests a-roving. With gum-leaves
waving at the prow, and pretty Chicago girls in
the bows, and two snug upper decks for tete-k-
-tSt-ing, and tea and strawberry food, the Athe-
nseum gay dogs did themselves and their guests
well indeed.
On the river the craft made procession like a
Christmas pantomime. A White Australia had
half an acre of sails fashioned of white flowers, a
silver Australia at the masthead, and an all-
white crew on deck. Madam Butterfly sailed
along superbly. A blue and white boat had
choristers aboard in charge of Dave Dunlop, a
singing brother of the tennis champion. In the
evening the Athenaeum let loose a masked and
domino-shrouded crew armed with good voices
and a miniature orchestra. Several other boats
broke out into guitar and mandoline. The
artistic Running Water toned down all the
sounds to a fine harmony.
Of course, it is ridiculously old-fashioned to
watch the races ; but a tragic stroke just before
a beautiful “finish ” almost made me weep. The
course was kept well cleared all day at racing
time ; but at this race some excited creatures in a
heavy craft pushed their nose over bounds,
and smash went the boat of the Uni-
versity’s senior eight when almost in goal.
The hearts of the Eight broke with the bows of
their beauty, and they pulled slowly out. The
race will be “run off” later. But that won't
mend the broken craft. The Tasmanians scored
points in the racing. In the midst of frivol and
small talk, their colors made themselves noticed
by repeated wins.
Sfconington gave two garden parties last week,
one on Wednesday and the other on Thursday,
which is pretty solid going for our State Govern-
ment House. The invitations for Wednesday
were purely feminine and political. The Victoria
League of Women first had a meeting and then
frivolled decorously. The day opened hot ;
but the rain came down on the parasols and
politics, so the tents were filled with the polite
arguments and the frocks. The House was not
opened to the Leaguers ; but the marquees pro-
vided shelter enough for them whilst the skies
were doing the gardener’s job for him.
The second party was a joyous thing held in
sunshine with pink roses blowing against a back-
ground of grey terrace wall. Pierrettes and
pierrots carolled under an awning alongside the
blowing roses ; and a band nearly burst in its
efforts to outdo them from the lawn below.
The visitors were so eager for the frivol
that they arrived before schedule time
(3.30). Motors and carriages were politely
dissuaded from entering the gates, while
Aides peeped unhappily round the pillars of the
verandah and sent agonised messages upstairs ;
but the Carmichaels were getting into party
duds as fast as they could—they had been open-
ing the motor drive out to Toorak at 2.30, and
the lady’s return home and quick change into a
dream of a lilac gown had all to be compressed
into the one brief hour. When at last the pair
came out, the dress—a trailing circumstance of
nonchalant coolness—was received with murmurs
of admiration. Someone has been re-drawing the
lines of the Carmichael lady’s figure ; it has the
new slenderness necessary for the new dressing.
The two Carmichael nieces were allowed half
the party to themselves. Members and their
wives were invited to bring their progeny at the
hair-bows stage; all these found a garden para-
dise flowing with pierrots and ice-cream. Premier
Murray brought his girls, whilst Mrs. Murray,
indisposed, stayed at home.
Mrs. Continental-Tyre Edwards is back in
Melbourne after a few months’ rush into Europe
with her husband. The Continental firm was the
first to manufacture the rubberised film used in
the building of air craft; and the Australian
manager and his wife have been in the very heart
of the aviation zone. The lady spent some time
at Greisheim, the starting place and goal of racing
aeroplanes. There is a vast tract of country there,
and within an enclosure the air craft are stalled.
You pay a guinea to go in and inspect the
machines as closely as you dare ; for a furious pro-
peller, whirring viciously, is no respecterof persons.
Up goes a little red balloon when there is prospect
of an aircraft getting a move on. Sometimes
several beautiful creatures are preparing at the
same time. They seem more than machine—each
has an individuality. When they are being wound
up to go, the noise is as of a hundred motors gurr-r-
-gurring frantically. Each has a note of its own,
too. And they fly, or don’t fly, in all shapes.
There are dragon flies, spiders and all sorts of
curious birds.
“The wonderful fascination grips one”; says
Mrs. Edwards. “To see an air craft approaching
arouses wildly-primitive emotions. People laugh
and weep—openly, without restraint. Emotional
people go into hysterics or faint; the most
phlegmatic of mortals jump and laugh and wave
their arms.” Mrs. Edwards saw the end of a
run from Maintz. The Emperor was to witness
the finish at the military barracks, but the race
was put off—the climatic conditions were un-
favorable. The race was flown later, with all the
pomp of the royal reception. But on this par-
ticular day of bad conditions one man refused to be
stopped. Mrs. Edwards saw this flight. First just
a tomtit on the distant horizon. The tomtit grew,
and came nearer—nearer and larger. Then a
faint, whirring, whispering in the air ; then the
great thing overhead, with a noise as of a mil lion big
birds coming down and down and down in majestic
curves, sweeping round and round toward the
earth, giving the small humans below a feeling of
terrified excitement. Its last curves brought it
gently to the ground, touching lightly as feathers.
“ He just got under cover in time,” added Mrs.
Edwards. “ Wasn’t he lucky ? For a great storm
of rain came the moment he was sheltered.” “It
would have injured the machine? ” I questioned,
sympathetically, feeling as if someone had got
home just in time with her best six-guinea hat.
“He wohld have been killed," said the eye-
witness with the calm emphasis of finality. The
chances these pioneers take !
Amidst the wild splashing of an all-day and
all-night water carnival, Carrefio’s Saturday
night recital at the Town Hall was a blissful
island of peace and restfulness. She played some
Chopin till it flowed round the hall like molten
silver. Then she distilled the quaint melody in
Macdowell’s Keltic Sonata. Manager Seherek,
like a quiet little white mouse, accompanied her
in the tempestuous Hungarian Fantasia by Liszt.
Carreno was beautifully gowned in a black and
white lacy thing, with shades of rose color flitting
out of the scheme here and there. The artist has
taken all her family with her to South Africa.
The Arion Society played “Dorothy ” for three
nights at the Princess’s. On Saturday, in spite
of Carreno and Henley, it drew a brimming
house. A quite new idea was to have the pro-
ceeds disposed of by vote. Every ticket carried
a coupon whereon one inscribed the charity he
or she most favored, and the three placed chari-
ties are to divide the spoils.
A fine orchestra of about 40 performers, practi-
cally all amateurs, supplied the wine of melody'
that went with the banquet of song. Conductor
Leon Lambert—he is a young French-Australiam
—worked like four galley slaves, 10 Trojans and
one stage-director. His wife, a very pretty fair
girl, played Dorothy, and sang in a sweet little
voice into the heights reserved for the soprano-
heroine. The chorus, with a mixture of German
and French, was rich and full. The music was-
artistic but a bit thin. The tenor managed to
get out some beautiful notes, though the demon
of Nervousness had him by the throat.
Ruby Grey, a pretty but rather thin girl, with
a dramatic but rather thin voice, gave a concert
last week, with a Governor and his Lady a-listen-
ing and Sassiety attending. Miss Grey is a Con-
servatorium girl who has studied industriously—a
most artistic student who is trying for higher
things than amatooah work. She is a daughter of
Dr. Grey, whose plate sparkled of yore in Collins-
street. All the daughters are beautiful as bits of
brunette Dresden china, and whatever their
hands have found to do they have done it artistic-
ally. Two of the daughters glorify the hat.
One of the Berrybank girls—Joseph Mack’s
fourth daughter—has murmured “ Yes ” to one of
the junior Carrs, of Geelong. In Geelong, Carr,
senior, is a name to wake people up with, and the'
Macks, of Berrybank, have been Western District-
folk since the Early Days. Another engagement
is that of Amy Young, the last of Tom Yqung’s
pretty daughters. They have been carried off one
by one as fast as they have grown into long
frocks. Amy, who is the eldest of the lot, has-
left her flitting till the last, and is now
making a race-time sensation with her frocks.
Doctor Brett is the happy man. He hails from
the seaside town of Mornington, and has a prac-
tice in Hawthorn. Another “engaged ” healer is
Dr. Gardiner, of Ballarat, whose lucky capture is-
nurse Nellie Wilson. When she had got through,
her Alfred Hospital training she and Doctor Gar-
diner worked together on her first private case.
It was fatal to both of them, though I believe'
the patient recovered. Miss Wilson is a sister
of Mrs. Wallach, one of the beauty matrons of
Toorak, and a niece of Tom Young of Horsham.
Seems as if Tom Young is being rushed for his
nieces now, since he has no more daughters to give-
away.
That lyrebird in Mrs. Donald Mackinnon’s
headgear on Caulfield Guineas Day worried me
for Mrs. Mac is a good Australian and a noted
lover of animal life. The mystery of the wear is-
exjjlained now : it wasn’t the real thing—it was a
tricky imitation, constructed of peacock feathers-
and beads. Wherefore, the lady is found Not-
Guilty, and lifted back to her pedestal in
“Johanna’s ” high esteem.
Frank Duffy, the fashionable barrister-at-law,,
sailed for England the other day with his wife and
one ewe daughter, leaving his large stock of grow-
ing boys to get along for a while without parental
care. The Duffys, after looking around, are to be'
in London for the Coronation, it is understood.
The call of the Coronation will be pretty strong,
according to all accounts. “ I wouldn’t dream of
missing it,” says one of the most gadding dames;.
“ I was there when King Edward was crowned—
aftey the appendicitis fiasco, you know.”
Talking of the law, Jim Purves, who dropped
out of the wig and gown competition when he
married Sadie Green, is now studying hard, and
expects to get his barristerial degree shortly.
Which explains his frequent absence from social
gatherings. James is just up to his shirt collar
in law-books.
A nice fat cheque for £3OOO odd has been handed
to the committee of the Foundling Hospital as
a result of the bazaar; and some oddments have
still to be gathered in.
M.L.A. Jack Thomson’s handsome wife, who
was a Robertson of The Grange, bought two
tickets in the raffle for the bejewelled bracelet of
the Foundlings, and handed one of them over to
her sister. The sister’s ticket took the trick.
The sad news trickled through from London
last week that George R. Higinbotham, eldest son
of the late Chief Justice, had died of blackwater
fever on August 28, on the deadly Gold Coast of
West Africa. “Young George” was a clever
metallurgist, who was beguiled to play for keeps
with the climate by the high stakes offering.
And the climate won.
Quamby Club, Melbourne’s new rest-house for
famished, tired or dishevelled females, was duly
opened to members on the 19th inst. It is located
at Allan’s Chambers, Collins-street, and is a
dream of comfort and artistic beauty. Mrs.
Rennie, its high-priestess, delivered an oration to
the members assembled, after which Mrs. Spencer
was elected president, and the company pro-
ceeded to “wet it” with tea. The club will pro-
bably be made a residential one later on.
The very Ouida-esque Englishman—handsome,
immaculately groomed and limited in repartee—
whom one sees always at the Savoy or in a box at
the Royal, is the Hon. John Jacob Astley, brother
of Lord Hastings, if you please, and sometime of
the 16th Lancers. The family title is 615 years
old.
Some women have such a taking way that it
practically amounts to piracy. Those in charge of
cloak rooms are well aware of the fact, and keep
a look-out sharper than that of a Customs
detective. A new and more brazen brand of
buccaneer than the cloak room looter appeared at
a recent Government House function. As the
guests were leaving a band of her swooped down
on the floral decorations of the afternoon tea
tables and marched off cheerfully, loaded with
fragrant spoil.
That playlet of Moore’s, “ The Tea-room Girl,”
could scarcely have been more local. The tea-
room girl exists in full vigor in Melbourne—
scarcely anywhere more so. The local color was
heightened by the scene being obviously laid in the
“ Block’s ” most prominent bun-house. A press-
man returns to his native home with loads of coin.
He hunts round the city for the tea-room girl
he loved and left behind. He sups in a Collins-
street bunshop, but sees only waiters. A quarrel
happens between the wealthy journalist and a
spiteful waster, a former pal. They jump to
fisticuffs. A waitress from upstairs comes in,
recognises her lost love, faints all over the
place, and is hugged by the angry fighter. The
surroundingmummersdisappear. Anangry waiter
demands the truant girl: “The Lord Mayor’s
party is waiting to be served ! ” There is a touch
of pathos here; you think at once of the Lord
Mayor and his Corporation starving upstairs.
The wealthy journalist’s reply is to buy the whole
room at a pound a minute. He pulls out a cable ;
his play is accepted, and this is a draft for £lOOO.
“ I’m yours,” sobs the tea-room girl hysterically,
gazing at the cable. Curtain. Happiness—
except for the Lord Mayor. He, poor fellow,
apparently goes on starving.
Glad news is to hand. This year the corset
may not press the heart. Last year the straight
jacket form would not even allow us to sit down.
Fashion now seems to have relented, for the

An equestrienne, who looks very like the
heroine in “The Whip,” has been lately ob-
served in suburban streets. She is an accurate
imitation of Lady Di. in the Williamsonian hip-
podrama, and sports the same chic habit and the
same smart boots with the siren shine. She is
always uncavaliered, and excites attention by
riding her big, bay nag astride. The other day
she took her mount into a South Yarra street,
where her divided-skirt and glittering boots were
viewed with the usual brutal results; - and a
policeman woke up from violent indignation.

Still I wonder what they’ll do about it. From
the apolicants which the Age advt. produces will
they pick the most beautiful, so as not to offend
the artistic eye of the hippopotamus, or will
they choose the ugliest, so as not to make the
orang-outang feel miserable with himself ?
From “ Rosna,” of Adelaide :
The Dutch fleet is tethered to the Outer Harbor, and
the week promises to be a wild one. The revels begin
with a gala night at “The King of Cadonia,” and end
with a ball in the North Adelaide Institute, hosted by
-South Australia’s one notable Dutch family, the Del-
prats, of Broken Hill and Brighton.
The marriage-market is brisk. On October 20 the
John Milnes’s son Roy took home Miss Craig, daugh-
ter of the late engineer of our Outer Harbor.
The night before, at St. Paul’s, Port Adelaide, Mr.
Montagu White, of Queensland, took pretty Florence
Jiirs to wife. The bride is a musical and popular local
damsel, and was handed to her benedict in cream lace
and satin, with the connivance of two pink-silk sisters.
At the self-same edifice, some days before, the Semaphore
Saunders’s cleric son Elliot was knotted to Miss Le Leu.
The newly-weds will settle down in Victoria.
The Liberal Union Conference is roaming' the landscape
in battalions. Miss Grace Watson, of Victoria, is here
with no less than 50 delegates trailing in her
wake. On Monday night, the Town Hall, aesthetically
arrayed in lilies and-greenery, opened its doors and broke
into music and supper for the delectation of the visitors.
There were quite three men present, and two of them had
been borrowed for speech-making purposes. And another
day there was a tea in the Gardens, just to prove what a
very liberal Union it is! Mrs. Harrison has been over
here to tell the Sydney Morning Herald all the deeds the
conference is planning, and Miss Grant Bruce has been
performing a like office for Melbourne Leader. Tiie
twain and Miss Grace Watson were captured on Saturday
morning by some of Adelaide’s she-scribes for tea, talk
and view at the river kiosk.
Mrs. Powis Stuart’s little Shakspeare Theatre, de-
signed for the “authentic and artistic production of
Shakspeare’s works, with correct scenery, costume,
music, dance and song,” has finally been opened, after
sundry and assorted delays. The theatre occupies a large
studio on the Payneham-road, and has built unto itself a
fine little stage, with most artistic accoutrements.
Here, on Thursday evening, “The Sylvanites,” as the
devotees dub themselves,ambled through slices of “The
Midsummer Night’s Dream,” with the correct accessories,
as mentioned above. Lady Bosanquet and the twin
damsels were there to see it done, with St. Peter’s Mayo*
Cruickshank to aid in their entertaining. Also, there
were sisters, cousins and aunts to the last square inch ot
room. The only fly in the ointment was the lighting ap-
paratus, which failed badly every now and then. The
conduct of the giddy stage moon was particularly repre-
hensible. The frocking of the play was really beautiful
for an amateur revel, and the acting, music, dancing and
song were laudable. A small Inman boy as Puck, and
Lysander Cocking and Hermia Lucas gathered most
laurels.
An impressive-looking circular regarding the Shak-
speare Theatre is abroad. It sets forth, among other
things, that five acres of beautiful hill-top country,
overlooking the Gulf, have been placed at the disposal of
those members who prefer to study in the open air, and
as a railway platform will shortly be erected a few yards
away, sylvan scenes from Shakspeare’s plays will be
placed before the public at an early date. The key of
“ The Cote ” will be given to members on application to
Mrs. Powis Stuart. How about Arcadian Adelaide?
Miss Rose Maepherson has been made chairwoman of the
Selection and Hanging- Committee for the forthcoming
Federal Art Show here.
Carrefto goes to make heavenly noises for South Africa
by the Wilcannia this week, but we are grabbing the lady
for one lone farewell concert as she goes.
Gwen Pelly, back in Adelaide after goodness knows
how much fiddle-culture in the cold Old Country, is
booked to give a concert in the Town Hall on November
3. The damsel carried the Elder Scholarship to Britain
a while back, and proposes returning there later at her
own expense.
Sincerely yours.

SUFFERERS FROM OYER-STOUTNESS.
How They May Cure Themselves.
In the first place it must not be lost sight of that
food is the very fuel of vitality. So many people •
who are alarmed by the first symptoms of an obese
tendency are prone to sacrifice themselves to a
sparing and innutritious dietary, and to exercise
themselves out of all reason. There is no
cure for obesity in such physical abuses.
The human organism requires gentler treat-
ment. Here is offered to stout readers a
splendid recipe which they can make up them-
selves (or get their chemist to do so), and by
means of which they may cure themselves, with-
out the least physical discomfort, of obesity in any
of its stages. The prescription is : One half-ounce
of Marmola, one ounce of fluid Extract of Glycyrr-
hiza 8.P., one ounce of pure Glycerineß.P., with
peppermint water to make six ounces in all. Dose:
Two teaspoonfuls after each meal. This simple
and harmless home treatment entails nothing re-
strictive—no fasting, no exhausting exercises.
Hence, while the superfluous fatty matter is being
rapidly removed, the subject as rapidly regains
strength and stamina through properly digested
food in rational qualities, the whole alimentary
system being toned up and re-fortified. It is a
beautiful and most efficacious method of self-cure
which no over-stout person should neglect.*


SUMMER TROUBLES of the COMPLEXION.
HOW TO AVOID THEM.
Suggestions from Mile. Helena Rubinstein.
THAT the sun plays havoc with the complexion has been an accepted fact from
earliest days, but the why and wherefore Science has only recently succeeded
in discovering. To Doctor Finsen, the famous Danish physician and
scientist, the palm must be awarded for any knowledge that we now possess ot the
true effect of the sun’s rays on the human skin.
Dr. Finsen discovered that it was not the heat rays of the sun, led, orange an
yellow in color, but the light rays—blue and violet —that cause discoloration, freckles,
tan and sunblister. The fact that severest sunburn occurs in mid-wintei, on
the snow-clad Alps, where the heat is naturally out of the question,
was unanswerable evidence.
When these curious things had been proved, half the battle
was won, and it .only remained to discover means of counter
acting the influence of these blue and violet rays, and so not
only banish but prevent freckles, sunburn, tan and sallowness
Ceaseless laboratory work of Continental Scientists has
solved the problem, and Mile. Rubinstein, the noted i
Viennese authority on Beauty-Cult, has been given sole
control of these astonishing sun-expelling discoveries.
The first preparation, before which freckles, tan and
sunburn completely retreat, is Yalaze. Distilled from a
beautiful flower herb, which grows on the wild slopes of
the Carpathian Mountains, its skin-clearing properties
are marvellous.
If beauty is at all worth while, then Valaze is the
trusted tool by which it is attained. For true beauty, I
maintain, is not merely conformity to an admired type or
regularity of features. It is a blend of many things, but there
is one essential. There must be a good complexion. And
this Valaze creates, making it outlast happiest anticipations,
and with a charm of skin that many never realise they could
possess.
Valaze charms every particle of impurity out of the skin, and makes it pure
and radiant within from a fortnight to a month from its first application. Valaze is
supplied in porcelain jars at 3s. 6d. and 6s. 6d. ; 6d. postage.
The other discovery is Novena Sunproof Creme ; and the timely use of this
speciality, coupled with Valaze, destroys the tanning and freckling effects of the sun’s
rays, and renders the skin immune from discoloration. 2s. and 3s. 6d.
Mile. Rubinstein is emphatic in the assertion that Valaze is not a cure-all, and
she supplies the following exclusive preparations, which are as invaluable in their
particular sphere of usefulness as Valaze is in its own : —

depilatories. 6s. 6d.; 6d. postage.

ACUTE NEURALGIA
This Woman's Life a Misery
until she found a cure*
+
“The pain was enough to drive me crazy.”
That is the way Miss A. G. Holland, 47 Tower
Street, Leederville, Perth, speaks of the severe
attacks of neuralgia in both sides of her face to
which she used to be subject. She gives the
following account of her suffering and cure :
“Last year, towards the close, I was suffering
greatly from neuralgia, and was generally run
down ; the pain in the whole of my face was
acute and hard to bear. The attacks would come
on practically without warning. I might wake
up free from pain, and as soon as I went outside
the house a puff of wind would bring on an
attack. I would have to press each temple hard
to get a little relief for a few moments. My head
would throb violently. I would have the neuralgia
stabbing each side of my face, as if needles were
being plunged in. I used to rub my cheeks with
eucalyptus, but the attacks only yielded for a
while. I did not leave my work, but I would
often have to take a spell and sit down for a few
moments. The pain was enough to drive me
crazy. Every tooth in my head seemed to ache,
and the gums were as tender as possible.
Some nights I could not close my eyes for hours
with the pain. I could not enjoy‘a meal. I would
be afraid to .eat for.fear an attack would come on,
'and I began to feel very pulled down in every
way. I happened, however, one day to come
across a pamphlet left under the door, so I
resolved to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and two
boxes toned my nerves up completely. The
attacks became less severe and wouldn’t last
nearly so long, and before the second box was
empty the neuralgia had vanished. I felt ever
so much brighter and stronger, too, in every way,
and have kept so ever since.”
Don’t let any dealer talk you into taking some-
thing which he says is “just as good.’’ If you
are pestered to take a substitute, send 2s. 9d. for
one box, or 15s. 3d. for six boxes, to the Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Co. of Australasia, Ltd.,

POLITICAL
POINTS
The way these great landlords are being
driven to economise is heartrending. The other
day several of them in the rich Western District
of Victoria curtly declined to subscribe their cus-
tomary guinea to Casterton Charity Sports Car-
nival “.owing to the Labor Government having
singled them out for crushing taxation.” Still,
the Caulfield Cup attendance was a record, and
quite a number of these same western men have
been waiting-over in Melbourne for the Cup—
camping m the parks, no doubt, and eating
broken victuals.
Victoria is now the only State that hasn’t
had a Labor Government.
Alfred Deakin, these days, reminds this
paper of the old nigger minstrel who said that a
certain road was so crooked that he was always
meeting himself coming back.
The Federal land tax is described by
Senator Cameron (Tas.) as “plunder, pure and
simple,” and “a parody on public decency, jus-
tice and the honor of the Commonwealth.” Of
course, of course ! How much better to Jet the
Cimerons go on owning their £140,000 or so of
soil, and employing their 30 or so of hands! It
may be rough on Tasmania—but, why drag in
Tasmania ?
There was an extra-strenuous attempt to
squeeze Holman out of his Cootamundra (N.S.W.)
seat —especially at Junee. Every motah-cah was
whipped up in Ryrie’s interest. One of the
vehicles was sent out about 20 miles for an old
lady who was so ill that nurses had to go with the
car ; but they got the ancient victim out, and
dressed her, and honked her into the booth. Then
the old lady went home and promptly died. And
liyrie was beaten, after all.
From the Federal gallery :
Attorney-General Hughes has made a sudden jump in
political reputation. His handling of the Land Tax Bill
was a clever piece of work ; but the biggest performance
was the speech with which he moved for an increase of
national powers in the Commonwealth Parliament.
The little man is working tigerishlv hard. Any
labor that Prime Minister Fisher had to undertake
over the Finance Hills was trivial in comparison
with what Hughes has already performed during the
session ; and now, while the placid Andrew is about to
give vent to harmless oratory in S’Africa, the Attorney-
General is steering through Parliament the biggest mea-
sure that the Commonwealth has ever faced.
Upper Houses are not Houses of Review
or Chambers of Culm Consideration and Second
Thoughts ; they are rather Homes of Hysterics.
The most frantically ill-considered things on
record are done by Upper Houses. Last week
the S. A. Leg. Council galloped through at one
sitting a measure to withdraw the offer of the
Northern Territory to the Commonwealth. The
two State Houses of S. ... accepted the Deakin-
Price agreement re ♦he territory some years ago.
The Bill has got thr mgh one Federal House, and
it was halfway through the other, when the Fossils
at Adelaide suddenly leaped 10ft. perpendicularly
in the air and roared. Then Attorney-General
Denny said things about the dreary body that
nearly blew its belltopper over into Westralia.
The haste of the Fisher Government to do
things lately moved Alfred Deakin to describe its
proceedings as “quick lunch legislation.” Poor
old Alfred’s variety was “fasting man ” or “dry
crust” legislation. You sat down at the table
and looked at Alfred’s political bill of fare. In
about three years a dead waiter came and you
ordered chops. The waiter departed slowly in a
state of decay and fell into dust before he reached
the door. Then you stayed around through geo-
logical periods till Judgment Day, and looking
down from the battlements of Heaven you saw
Alfred’s cook still chasing the sheep through per-
dition. Truly there was no quick lunch about
the Deakin methods. In his restaurant the
dropped soup took six months to reach the floor,
and as likely as not you saw Alexander the Great
at the next table, for time didn’t matter there.
YASSBERRA.
The Wade Government, which strongly supported Yass-
berra, has shared the fate of the Fusion Government,
which was also a sufferer from the Yassberra infirmity.—
Notorious Fact.
AUSTRALIA: “Now, constable, how much deader
has the corpse to be before you hare it re-
moved and permanently buried?"
There was a certain amount of upheaval
last week at the gathering of the N.S.W. Congre-
gational Union, when a fine, crusted Tory parson
called Cunliffe-,Tones raged about the causes ■
Wade’s downfall:—
Mr. Wade had against him, first, the Labor party, which,
of course, had a right to its opinion ; then the publican,
sinner and gambler, the sweater, and generally the un-
clean forces of the city, which had been dealt with by the
Government during the past four years.
Three questions seem to arise just here : (1) What
use are the alleged stupendous doings of Wade in
putting down the forces of evil if, after all, the
forces of evil are so strong as to sway an election ?
In other words, what kind of an incapable is
Wade? (2) What is the good of the community
being burdened with the keep of Congregational
ministers if they can show' no better results than
these ? (3) What kind of awful company dpes
Ctinliffe-Jones affect that he gets to know these
things ?
One of the factors in Wade’s
wallop in tlie country was the fear that the
N.S.W. Government was mixed up in a State
Insects’ conspiracy to try and bring trouble on the
Australian Government by the spiteful use of a
heavy State land tax, in addition to the Federal
tax. The fact that during October two “Liberal”
Governments —those of Victoria and Tasmania
proposed a State land tax in their respective
budgets gave color to this; and the thoughtful
man on the land wasn’t happy until he saw the
Wade flag flying at half-mast.
A HOPEFUL RESERVATION.
It was the greatest mistake to say that England was
decadent, hut she would be better with a bit of
compulsory military service. —A Reid-dinner cable.
FAMOUS EQUIVOCATOR: “No, no, Father Bull!
Nothing wrong at all with you. You'll be as
young as ever y’ was—with a bit of strenuous
exercise, physical culture an’ such!"
The N.S.W. Assembly will fall-in without
a knight.or any other individual owning a British
pump-handle prefix. “Jimmy ” Graham was the
last to go ; and his fall before H. C. Hoyle in
Surry Hills was mighty—37ll to 2399.
One section of wowserdom begins to suspect
that, as an aid to No License electioneering, the
motor-car is a mistake. The swift, luxurious
vehicle is suspected of causing a sinful, devil-may-
care and generally demoralised condition of mind,
which, by the time the booth is reached, prompts
the most staid to vote for any old sin—the worse
the better.
“The citizens of the Commonwealth are
the citizens of the States —what, then, have the
Federal electors to fear?” asked Deakiu, doing
his bit of special pleading against the Common-
wealth Government’s proposal to extend the
Federal powers. But why not upend it: The
citizens of the States are the citizens of the
Commonwealth —what, then, have the State elec-
tors to fear?
A genius signing himself “ A. McNaughfc ”
lately (17/10/’IU) expounded a scheme to “pre-
serve State Bights,” which lie reckons are going
to be damaged by the Federal land-tax. Under
the Constitution the Commonwealth can’t tax
State property, so the Mc() proposes that owners
should hand over their land to the States and get
it back under a system of leasehold. Then the
O’Zero considers the beastly Commonwealth
would be euchred, and the State Houses of Fat
could see that democratic State Governments
didn’t unduly interfere with the “rights of pro-
perty.” It’s about the biggest thing in land
nationalisation schemes up to date, and the rush of
the landlords to deposit their freehold title deeds
on the doormats of Labor Premiers McGowen
and Verran is expected to be tremendous.
Labor in N.S.W. needs an executive and
a secretary that are not in the firing line, contest-
ing seats for themselves. In the Federal cam-
paign the organisation was first-rate, because there
were the State workers to do the drudging. Butin
the State election almost all the campaigners had
their own troubles ; practically the whole execu-
tive, general secretary and all, was thus scattered
over the country ; while little Minahan, the pre-
sident, who should have been busy making bullets
for the other men to shoot, was fighting English
in Belmore, and feeling anything but sure of the
result. So there was practically no organisation,
in spite of the oceans of “Liberal” guff to the
contrary. Another thing, the Labor candidates
for the Liberal seats should be picked long before
they 7 are. They ought to be chosen 12 or 18
months before the polling, and thus given a
chance to nurse their intended electorates instead
of being thrown at them, unknown men, to wrest
the perch from members who have been dandling
the district’s babies for years.
A. C. Cocks, who won St. Leonards
(Sydney) for the Wade party on Friday, after a
second ballot, seems easily satisfied. In return-
ing thanks he declared :
lie was proud of their leader (Wade) in the fight just
closed, proud to be under the Liberal banner, and proud
to think that in a short time the party would be in power
again working for the advancement of the community.
. . . The campaign had been fought in a thoroughly
clean way.
If Cocks suspected that the closing of the ballot
at G o’clock m the evening was a mean attempt
to prevent workers getting to the poll, no doubt
Cocks would admit that the campaign had not
been fought in a thoroughly clean way, or
even a quarter-clean way. Also, if some-
body assured Cocks that between 8 a.m.
and 8.30 a.m., when the bulk of the
voters might reasonably be assumed to be Labor,
such careful examination of the right to vote was
frequently made that many men had to rush
for their work without being able to vote at all,
then Cocks would no doubt cast his Parlia-
mentary job into a ditch. And Heaven knows
what Cocks would do if it should strike him that
there was an ulterior motive for taking the second
ballot on Friday—the late-shopping night, when
shoals of workers were stranded on their em-
ployers’ premises until 9 p.m. or 10 p.in. Pro-
bably, in that case, he would precipitately flee
from the “Liberal ” gang, and refuse to be found
dead with it.
One Holyman, master mariner, got a close
view of State Frights the other day, and, inci-
dentally, was fined £lO for bringing a leaky
steamer into the dubious Yarra. It appears that
the Tasmanian authorities had considered the
ark fit to cross Bass Strait, but the Victorian
authorities didn’t consider it safe enough even to
be lying in port. Which seems to suggest that it
is about time the business was taken in hand by
the Federal authority, so that at any rate a ship
won’t be declared safe and unsafe at the same
time.
The other day the Beechworth shire (Vic.)
was told that the council’s overdraft amounted to
£2753. And the secretary re-
marked that it was estimated
that for the coming year the
expenditure would exceed the
income by £2566. Whereupon
the president said it was evi-
dent that a rate of Is. in the £
was not sufficient, and he gave
notice that he would move that
the general rate be increased
to Is. 6d. and the health rate
to 6d. Whereat Bedlam broke
loose, and the councillors repre-
senting the indigenous cookies
and squatters (whose land is
mostly valued at about £3 per
acre, though you can’t buy it
for double the money) got up
with fire in their eyes and the
time-worn and disreputable old
proposal that State Treasurer
Watt should be pressed to foot
the bill. To stop the chief ex-
cuse for this cadge—that the
shires are already heavily taxed
—it is time somebody picked
up the Shire Valuation Bill,
which Bent made a great show
of passing a few years ago, but which he promptly
threw under the table when some of the country
M’s.L.A. frowned.
“ Floater,” from the gallery :
On the Federal Referendum Bills, Dealdn had the irid-
escence of a bubble and the evasiveness of smoke. Mere
logic he ignored in weaving tapestries out of nothing.
Consistency he forgot in the inebriation of his own
rhetoric. Once he said that he had “a mind open to all
the proposals in the Bills,”'quite forgetting that he had
just condemned the proposals as “drastic remedies.”
Again, he cried about amending "this Constitu-
tion in a radical fashion,” when he had himself
proposed a radical amendment, of the same Constitu-
tion on the familiar subject of New Protection. But if
Alfred was shadowy and inconclusive, he still remained
a State Frights pleader all the time. In solemn tones he
pictured the gradual mutilation of the States; the
demolition of their powers, and the uprising of the tiger
of Unification. Incidentally, though, he brought no-
thing that was substantial against the Bills, lie did
suggest that both went too far, and did remark that one
should have been split into four different Bills. On
this subject he argued that constitutional amendments
referring to corporations, industrial disputes, trade and
customs, and trusts and combinations, are four distinc-
tive questions on which the people should have four
separate votes. In urging this he disregarded the fact
that the four questions are really sections of a proposal
to enlarge Federal powers in affairs of industry, wages,
commerce, etc. Why, therefore, the people should be
asked to vote on separate phases of a comprehensive pro-
posal will baffle anyone less ingenious in pleading or
dexterous in reasoning than Australia’s own, wonderful
Alfred Deakin.

K. Gregory :
The presage of large triumph fills my soul !
Gordon hath smitten Labor. All the field

Hath gotten him to horse. The day is ours!
First Courtier :
My Lord, the victory is thine alone ;
The kingly strength of thy triumphant tongue
Hath smitten dark McGo aen from the field ;
Thy repartee hath hanged upon the nose
All thine opponents, and the briny wash
Of thy most potent tears hath swept away
The fords by which the people sought to pass
To place and office.
Second Courtier : All the praise be thine !
Proud victory sics upon our waistcoat curves.
Omnks: Proud victory sits upon our waistcoat curves!
K. Gregory:
Thanks friends. Your praise doth honor to yourselves.
The fight is fought; the triumph is assured.
Fat hatli his victories no Jess renowned

Proud emblem of our local sovereignty,
And death to all Australia?
Omnes : Hail the pump,

K. Gregory: Who comes here?
Thy breath is scant, and both thy cheeks are pale.
Which suits not with this hour.
Messenger : Gracious, my Lord.
K. Gregory : Well, say, sir.

K. Gregory (overcome with grief) :
Why, so, so, so, so, so. My crown is gone.

The “ Liberal March ”is over. lam sick.
Give me a little space in which to die.

And break it to our hope? O Fat, Fat, Fat!
Had I but served the people now and then
As diligently as I worshipped thee
They had not bumped me out with such a bump.
O Justice ! O Chief Justiceship forsworn !
I think that we shall never make again
At any future time vague threats against

Beneath the parish pump of m.v desire,
And never let men murmur o’er my head
Of Federal triumphs. None shall snatch my crown,
’Tis mine alone for all the days to be.
I shall remain when others are forgot,
And men shall point the tomb that still enshrines
The smallest man of all a little crowd
The smallest, least, and meanest of them all.
Dies to slow music.
The Herald, Telegraph and News descend from a
cloud and cover him with newspapers.

NOTIONS
Willie Judkins says the Church can be nothing
but an out-an-out enemy of the Melbourne Cup :
The enmity of pot and pan—
Proverbial with common man
Is nothing to the awful hate
Existing- ’tween the Cup and Plate.
Blairgour and Balgowan, the two sons of Wake-
ful, are scratched for Melbourne Cup, and punters have
ceased to worry over the question whether they ever
were much better than their public form, or always much
worse than was supposed. Blairgour, the Derby and Cup
colt that might have been, is probably a much superior
animal to his four-year-old brother Balgowan when
there’s nothing mysterious the matter with him ; but Bal-
gowan is probably a rank duffer, anyhow. Owner Leslie
Macdonald seems to have over-rated the pair of them
because their mother was a wonderful mare. In their
different ways they are equally dissimilar in appearance
from their parents. Being by Wallace from Wakeful, they
are somewhat in-bred, for sire and dam had the same
grandfather—Musket.

Re Comedy King for Melbourne Cup, there is
the significant announcement that McLachlan’s en-
gagement to ride the English horse is a provisional
contract. If Comedy King is not “ all right ”on the day,
Mac is to be at liberty to take another mount. The bear-
ing of which much-published statement lies in the appli-
cation of it, as Captain Cuttle would have said. No pains
are being spared in the promulgation of alarming refer-
ences to Comedy King’s alleged rheumatic eccentricities.
Melbourne bad it by wire from Sydney that the gee-gee’s
sudden rheumatism would probably prevent his running
in the Spring Stakes at Randwick four weeks ago ;
nevertheless, Comedy King started —and won. His sub-
sequent defeat in the Craven Plate was ascribed to
rheumatism, and now the animal’s reputation for fitful
pains in the joints is fairly established. The newspapers
take care that the public shan’t forget it. Sol Green, the
owner of Comedy King, has a big bookmaking interest in
keeping his horse’s uncertain infirmity well before the
public gaze for the present. Sol doesn’t lay against his
own horse. Very properly he is making his book for it.
Therefore, he desires the market prices of other horses
to remain shorter than they would be if Comedy
King’s prospects for the Cup were unclouded by
public misgivings re the rheumatism that comes like a
thief in the night to steal away his fleetness. The
shorter the price laid by other books against Comedy
King, the longer the odds which Sol must lay against
other favorites if he wants to do business. This para-
graph doesn’t suggest that Comedy King never suffers
from lumbago, but his backers may be reasonably ad-
vised to hope for the best. The Melbourne weather is
likely to be warmed up by Cup Day, and rheumatism is
rarely troublesome in a high temperature. The chances
are that McLachlan will consent to ride Sol Green’s horse
next Tuesday-.
* * * *
Nothing seems more likely to happen in this
year’s Melbourne Cup race than the victory of a short-
priced favorite. It happened last year when the Derby
winner came first, and the winner and runner-up in the
Melbourne Stakes finished second and fourth for the Cup.
It happened in Apologue’s year and Poseidon’s year.
And this year it seems that nearly everything with a
good Cup chance is pretty' certain to be given a public
trial of its form on Derby Day. Of the three-year-olds
that look dangerous for the w.f.a. race, Tanami, at time
of writing, is a hot favorite, and Bobadea, Danaiis, Desert
Rose, Cadonia, Beverage and Golden Point are expected to
run. The Derby winner is not likely to be actual first favor-
ite for the Cup at the start, but if Tanami does the trick,
as he did at Randwick, he is bound to be much fancied
by the public. He stays well, and is pretty certain to
shape well in the two-mile race. All the same, he
doesn’t look to be more than one of the best of a poor lot
of three-vear-olds. The same was said of Prince Foote
last year; but, then, Prince Foote was more decidedly
boss than Tanami appears to be. Perhaps he isn’t the
very best over the Derby distance. This writer fancies
that Bobadea will beat Tanami and Beverage next Satur-
day.
In the Melbourne Stakes, the winner of the
forthcoming Cup will probably run and get a place.
Comedy King, Alawa, Trafalgar, Pendil, Maltine, Fla-
vinius, Britain and Parsee are all in it at time of writing.
There are others—Son of the Marsh and Gold Lace—
capable of pacing with the best of them, but two of the
lot mentioned should finish first and second. Needless to
say- that, if Trafalgar were to win the Stakes (which is un-
likely), he would start a warm favorite for the Cup,
seeing that his stamina is an established fact. Comedy
King in like case will be a red-hot Cup favorite,
for he is credited with 2-mile powers, and his weight
(7st. 111 b.) is a winning one, whereas Parsee, Maltine or
Flavinius may capture the Stakes without persuading
the susceptible public that the Cup is “ all over bar the
shouting.” And so with Alawa, who is not considered
wound up for a long-distance struggle, no matter what
may- be the state of his leg or his temper on the coming
Tuesday. The writer expects Parsee to win the Stakes
without bringing disgrace on Trafalgar, Comedy King
and Flavinius. The son of Metal is a flier, when
quite ripe, over any distance up to 1J miles. His trainer
thinks he can stay the Cup course also, but the wisest
trainers deceive themselves re the measure of a fast
horse’s stamina. Granted that Parsee, after being blocked
in the recent Metropolitan, finished fourth, close to
Flavinius, and will meet the said Flavinius on much
better terms at Flemington. He may- defeat the Caulfield
Cup winner over the two miles —why shouldn’t he, seeing
that his lj-mile credentials are as good. But he has so
often failed to run like areal stayer that unprejudiced
opinion is now dead against his Melbourne Cup chance.
One reckons that Trafalgar, though not a great horse, can
give 71b. to Parsee over two miles. Which reckoning
applies to the case of Flavinius, who is also said to
be a stayer because he won the Caulfield Cup brilliantly-.
The extra half-mile makes a lot of difference, and Trafal-
gar, of all the heavyweights, is the only- one that has
humped a big burden with impressive effect in a two-
mile handicap.
Pendil, another proved stayer, has not done a
big thing under a big weight. He has failed like Lord
Nolan, another good little one who, by the way-, is more
leniently handicapped this time. Last year Trafalgar
(list., lib.) was fairly outstay-ed by Alawa (9st. Sib.)
in the race where Prince Foote smothered ihetn
both at the finish. But the Wallace horse was
then overdone. He was the tiredest animal in the
field before the start. This year his trainer has presum-
ably profited by experience, and Trafalgar, all going
well, should be in great heart on the day. Comedy King
is a very vexed question. His form looks good enough
to win the Cup if he can stay, allowing even that his de-
feat of Prince Foote at Randwick has been dis-
counted by the subsequent failure of both of them.
On the other hand, Comedy King is under sus-
picion of having suffered considerably from a cold,
or something that caused him to lose flesh. Yet
his owner seems truly confident that the English
horse is a real good thing. The writer prefers him to
Matouree (6st. 71b.), on the ground that the lightweight
is a commoner in the best company ; and to Apple Pie
and Britain, for the reason that the one is very small and
the other is by Grafton, whose stock have never yet
shown great stamina. Britain can stay a lf-mile race
.better than Apple Pie perhaps, but the extra |-mile may
find out the weak spot. Of the lot not mentioned in
the foregoing guesswork, this scribe would as soon back
Artillerie, Mutilator or Olivaster as Matouree, Britain,
Apple Pie or even Flavinius, and the tip is boiled
down to: —
Trafalgar 1
Comely King 2
Bobadea and Tanami afterwards.
In the Hotham Handicap on Saturday two or
three of the Cup horses may run, and if Matouree is to
carry overweight for a jockey’s sake in the Cup, he might
as well try to earn the penalty, which will make no dif-
ference to him. Moreover, he should win if he is any
“ class ”to speak of. For the Steeplechase on Cup Day
nothing looks so promising as Obelisk, and for any race
not exceeding a mile Gold Lace is worth considering.
She is said to be the most slippery mare that ever came
to Australia from Maoriland.

N.S.W.’s anti-gambling laws prohibit the pub-
lication of betting odds prior to a race, but some news-
papers have developed the way of sailing close to the
wind. One rubbed shoulders with the law last week, by
putting the betting odds on the Cup down thuswise :
“ Betting : Trafalgar and Comedy King are favorites at
a point more than the fingers for one hand. Flavinius is
three more, Britain two more, Tanami and Matouree two
more. ”
If the law can be beaten as easily as that, it is a more
montrous ass than suspected.

The first attempt to cross the Atlantic in a
dirigible was expected to end in a splendid disaster ; and
a mere failure, in which every member of the crew, in-
cluding the cat, was saved is disappointing. The fact that
the sky-sailors took a cat with them sterns to have been a
tacit admission of the general charge that they were
ratty. Wellman found five others reckless enough to
share the risk; one of them, the aerographer, was an
Australian named Irwin. As the crew was cosmopolitan,
the fact that one Australian found a place therein is a
feather in the national sunshade. The trouble seems to
have been that the balloon, instead of carrying its
extra gasolene on board, trailed it on the water at
the end of a rope, and this weight acted like an anchor,
and prevented any speed being made. Exactly what
happened to the dirigible has not been made plain. All
we know is that it was “ wrecked” 480 miles east of Cape
Hatteras, half way to Bermuda, and was abandoned bv
the crew, who cut the boat-car loose f om the gas-bag, and
were afloat till picked up by the steamship Trent. When
cut loose the dirigible vanished, and is believed to have
sunk owing to the weight of the machinery on board.
Wellman, although he had one hand injured in the rescue,
is already planning to make another flight in 1911, and
an interested millionaire has announced that he shall
have everything he requires regardless of cost. It was a
daring effort, and has ended much better than most
people expected.
. * * * *
All over the white man’s world, barring Britain
and her dependencies, the craze of the hour is aeronau-
tics. Wellman,, the Yankee, has set the fashion, in
transatlantic flights, or attempts thereat, and already
two imitators are announced, and Wellman is also going
to have a second shot. Last week saw 10 balloons, repre-
senting America, France, Germany and Switzerland, start
from St. Louis (U.S.A.) to race for the Gordon Bennett
Cup and £4OO, the balloon that made the longest flight
to take the cup and the boodle. Britain was not repre-
sented, neither was any British State or colony; but
Canada afforded a solid alighting place for the com-
petitors. At least three came down in water, and
a German one plunged into Lake Nipissing. The
splash seems to have been a record; the scared
Indians who heard it concluded that the moon
had fallen into the lake. They are brave men,
those Indians, or else their curiosity is of a rare and
wonderful order; for they pulled out in their canoes to
see this moon at close quarters, and found clinging to it
white men whose speech they did not understand, and
with whom, for a time, they refused to have anything; to
do. So the wrecked aeronauts swam to an island and
shivered, till one Indian, bolder than the rest, came to
their succor. The other balloons fled on, and came down
all over eastern Canada ; one, the Germania, alighting
in Quebec province, after traversing 1195 miles of
sky and cloud. This is believed to be a world’s
record. At time of writing, nine of the jlO
were accounted for, and the missing one, the
America 11., was said to be in Lake Huron and its passen-
gers safe on an island. This ballooning is a fool of a busi-
ness, anyhow; and comparable to launching a crowd of
boats on a stream, the one that floats longest and drifts
farthest to take the bun.

Either the aeroplane is an incentive to straight
shooting or they have some dandy shots in the Yankee
army, small as it is. At Boston lately Lieutenant Fickle
went up'lOOft. in a Curtiss biplane, and, travelling at 30
miles an hour, fired six shots at targets on the ground.
Only one missed. Perhaps it’s a Yankee lie, as the Yanks
are the worst sports in the world ; but, if it is correct, a
small body of picked shots let loose on armored aero-
planes could practically wipe out an army. But the
trouble is to get an armored aeroplane. Beyond scout-
ing, the aeroplane doesn’t strike one as a formidable
weapon for fighting purposes. It cannot be very heavily
protected, if protected at all. The real smash of the near
future will be when some lumbering old-fashioned army
is attacked by a squadron of armored motor-cars which
will dash in close, and from comparative safety pour out
waves of bullets from machine guns in every direction.
*** * *
Graharne White, the English aviator who has
been shaking up the Yanks at Boston, recently took the
mayor of that cultured city of boiled beans three times
round the course at the height of 100 ft. He also offered to
take President Taft; but Taft, being a blunt man, said he
would see him in Heaven first. Taft weighs 20st., so,
naturally, he cannot put too fine a point on things.

On Saturday last, Birtles arrived at the Post
Office at Perth, having circumwheeled the continent, a
distance of 9200 miles, in 357 days—eight less than a year.
The latter part of his cruise was adventurous, the cyclist
striking trouble with both natives and fever. Exactly
what Birtles sets out of it all it is hard to say. Last time
he went a-journeving, he wrote a book ; but as he is nei-
ther a trained writer nor a born one, it was not a success,
though it contained some excellent material. Even a hair-
raisino- adventure becomes a dull affair if dully told, and
Birtles had no desperate adventures worth speaking of.
It was a case for gossipy writing, and Birtles could ride
round five continents more easily than he could write one
page of gossipy copy. * Certainly, he has established the
reputation of the Australian-made bike and the Austra-
lian-made tyre in a way that is hard to beat. But it is
not certain that it is the first time that has been done.
In spite of all, the fact that sticks out is that it is a
mighty performance done by a very little chap; for
Birtles, brave as he is, would be small beside even the
late Napoleon the One. * *
The N.S.W. cricket selection committee has
chosen 25 players to practise for the match against
Queensland next month. A little new blood has been
dropped in ; hut the new men will need to battle to get a
final place. Many promising players were omitted ; and,
just to heap bricks on the head of the committee, those
left out have wallowed in all the limelight in the grade
matches since the practice team was chosen. There
isn’t much giorv in being on the selection committee in
N.S.W., where the cricketers of promise are like flies in
a hash-house.
A wet Friday and a cold, bleak week-end, with
an icy wind that cut to the bone, made Saturday in
Sydney an ideal day for a good book, a first-class smoke
and a bottle of something extra special. Such a horrible
day was it that at the University Oval the bails had to be
glued on. * Result was that wickets fell like skittles.
Docker, of Burwood, took six for 17 and three for nine, a
total of nine for 26—a fearsome record. Sydney, against
which he bowled, was all out in the first innings for 37,
and in the second innings lost four wickets for 20
runs. In neither innings did a batsman reach double
figures, and the highest score was nine, made by Asher
in the first innings, when he carried his bat. Macartney,
of Gordon, had a happy time against Waverley, raking
in seven for 29. Cody, of Sydney, gave Burwood some
change for Docker’s deadly trundling by smashing up five
Burwood wickets for 18. 'Asher took one wicket for one
run in the same innings. Unsworth, of Petersham,
knocked down six North Sydney wickets for 27 ; Proctor,
of North Sydney, replied with five Petersham’s sticks for
23. Smith, of Burwood, also waddled into notice with
four Sydney wickets for 20.
Naturally, the batting results looked very sick.
The highest score was C. McCarthy’s 88, made for Glebe
against Balmain. P. Johnston-, of Gordon, carried his
timber for 67 against Waverley’s deadly bowling, F. Gow
smacked up 60 for Paddington against Middle Harbor ;
and his clubmate, S. Small, made 59. The great and
glorious Victor Trumper banged a modest 58 for Gordon,
after that they tailed off rapidly.
The rosiest exploit in Melbourne Pennant
cricket last Saturday was P’ran’s 243 for eight wickets
against Richmond. ’ East Melbourne, which generally
bats in a hefty style, made only a moderate 246 against
University ; and South Melbourne lost nine for 204
against Carlton. Melbourne’s 104 for one wicket seems
an unnecessarily vigorous response to Collingwood’s total
of 124 ; and Essendon’s two for 49100 ks like the beginning
of a determined reply to North Melbourne’s score of 108.
The match between St. Kilda (all out for 84) and North-
cote (two for 54) was so thrilling that several thousand
spectators nearly died from shock.
J Victoria Cricket Association’s sole selector,
Hugh Trumble, didn’t consider it worth the trouble to
extend a chance to young blood for the first inter-State
match against South Aus., which begins at Adelaide on
Friday. The team is certainly good on paper ; but, in
the State’s interest, places should have been found for
promising juniors. The batting is sound; but the
bowling doesn’t impress as being formidable in the ab-
sence of a fast bowler to vary the attack. *
Sydney Royal Yacht Squadron opened its
season on Saturday, and caught squalls. It w'as a
beastly day, and the harbor was dotted over with cap-
sizes which were far from being fun. The wind was icy,
and the water was as near that way as it could get. In
fact, so rough was it that even the Royals gave up the
run across the Heads to Manly, and laid a fair-weather
course round the Pile Light and the Lightship. The only
yacht that scorned to bow to the gale was White
Wings ; it proudly flew the ordinary spread of can-
vas. The start of the race was all right; it was
after rounding the Lightship the fun commenced, when
the wind blew right in the teeth of the squadron, tossing
the smaller boats like walnut shells. Oulwulla 111. came
racing through it, and close alongside the little Petrel
rode the gale like the bird it is named after. Then
Oulwulla fell back—it seemed incapable of making
headway—and at Shark Island White Wings dashed
to the front, followed by the plucky little Petrel,
with Oulwulla third. Magic and Sunbeam dropped
out* at the end of the first run. On the second
trip down the harbor Petrel carried away something, but
the damage was repaired in great style. Oulwulla
carried away some of the gear and had to drop right out,
and only Petrel, White Wings and Yeulba remained in.
White \Vings was in the front, and Petrel and Yeulba
continued to exchange places ; but it was Petrel’s turn
to be the front one of the two when crossing the line.
White Wings finished in the lead, and Petrel and Yeulba
in that order. But the Royals are apparently a Scriptural
crowd, for when the handicaps were adjusted it was
found the last was first and the first last. So the actual
finish in the handicap was Yeulba, Petrel and White
Wings.
The star items of the day were the turn-out of
the Port Jackson Skiff Club arid the Flying Squadron.
The way the skiffs bounded from ridge to ridge when
running before the wind was marvellous. Most of the
time three-parts of the hulls seemed to be out of water
as they jumped from crest to crest or the water fell
from under them. The Flying Squadron had a wild and
woolly time of it. Of the 14 entrants five dropped out,
and the papers with one accord arose and yelled “ fair-
weather sailors.” Most of the people responsible for the
remarks would not have ventured on the water t hat day
in anything smaller than a ferry steamer. If a man
knows he has little more than Buckley’s chance
of keeping afloat and no chance of winning
the race at all, then he is a fool to start, as
by capsizing he might bring disaster on one or
more innocent crews, and generally spoil what might
otherwise be a good race. This writer rises to drink to
the men who have the pluck to stand out when it is
wiser to do so. However, to come back to the contest.
The nine that remained in certainly made good sailing ;
but what escapes! The finest edges that have been
paired off bad smashes must have been scattered round
on Saturday. The trouble started with the crowding on
of spinnakers. For awhile all went well, and then off
Bradley’s Head Donnelly bolted, charged through, and
interfered with Nimrod. The Acme was swept out of
her course by a churning steamer. Out of the first heat
Nimrod, Donnelly,Violet and Keriki emerged in that order.
The second heatj a tame affair, was won by Livonia, Zena,
Advance and Sunny South, in that order. When the
final was called, five more skippers drew out, and left the
final to he battled for by Donnelly, Nimrod and Sunny
South. With a mighty spinnaker booming out, Nimrod
tore through the water on the run, but, nearing Taylor
Bay, Sunny South was in front, and Donnelly closing up
fast. Immediately the wind was hauled, Donnelly began
to assert superiority. Nimrod was staggering, and
Sunny South could make no headway at all, while
Donnelly plunged through it and came up smiling every
time, to eventually win with a margin of 2£ minutes.
Sunny South was third.

William Henry, founder of the Royal (Eng.)
Life Saving Society and true humanitarian, is sojourning
with the Sydney swimming authorities. Henry has held
out a friendly hand to Australian swimmers who have in-
vaded Europe, and Healy, Kieran and Beaurepaire owe
him much. The gist of the visit will be divulged in a
series of lectures on life-saving, and Australians will be
true to themselves if they are richer in the true elements
of swimming ere the visitor throws his kit bag' on the
foreign-going steamer. #
“ Bill” Murray, of Melb., who recently won
the second Victorian Marathon race, engineered by the
East Melb. Harriers, in a record 2hr. 58min. 48sec.,has
come rapidly to the front. About 12 months ago, he was
of the rank and file ; since then he has collared a 10-mile
cross-country race in Tasmania in the alleged record
time of 55min. 55sec., a three-mile championship at the
same meeting, a 10-mile walk (lhr. 25min. 40sec.) at
Melbourne in March, besides a string of handicap events.
His ambition now is to cross the border to beat Andy
Siuie, the N.S.W. crack and present recognised champion
Marathon runner of Australasia. If the finances will
stand it, Australasia could not be represented by three
better men than Andy Sime (N.S.W.), Will Murray (Vic.)
and “ Mack ” Connor (Geelong, Vic.) at the next Olympic
Games, to be held in Stockholm in 1912.

The Victorian amateur athletes have recom-
menced their record-smashing crusade. At Wesley
College sports last week L. H. Kelly cleared 6ft. in the
running high ; the previous best was sft. lOgin., by Eric
Russell, though the latter’s Australasian record, estab-
lished at the Tasmanian championships last February,
was also 6ft. The world’s record (6ft. sfin.) was put up
by M. F. Sweeney at N’Yark on Sept. 21, 1805. M. A.
Conroy, a professional, leaped over 6ft. sin. at the Ware-
housemen’s Cricket Ground (Vic.)on Dec. 26, 1891.
The “club championship of Australia’ has
become a fixed event now'—Australian rules, of course.
The boss club of Victoria goes across each year and takes
on the premiers of S. A., generally with the ill-luck that
mostly attends travelling teams. This year it was Coll-
ingwood that made the journey, and not quite at full
strength. The result was a shock. Up to half-time
there was only one point between the scores ; after that
Port Adelaide went mad and ’Wood went dead. It was
like Johnson toying with Burns. Port’s score in points
soared into the hundreds, and for a time could not be
hoisted, as no one had dreamed that a third peg could
be required ! The aw ful record was : Port Adelaide, 15
goals 20 behinds; Oollingwood, 7 goals 9 behinds. Pre-
sumably it was a question of better training—the day
was 80° in the shade.

Though the flocking of women to Henltw-on-
the-Yarra and of men to Moonee Valley told that summer
had arrived, the Vic. Junior footbrawlers persisted in
deciding their “grand final” on Saturday, when Port
Juniors and Yarraville bogged in for their third consecu-
tive “ final,” at Croxton Park. Mostly the same crowd
that had watched the previous collisions lined up; also
the same amount of Law looked on —and it was as
well it did, for the encounter would otherwise have
developed into a free fight. As it was, the said
Law', after a few cautions, took several of the
brawlers’ names. Even then the hasty fist was still
noticed, and three boggers-in were knocked out for the
rest of the day at various stages of the function. When
Port Juniors allowed the previous game to go to Yarra-
ville by 60 points to four, they evidently knew something,
and oil Saturday the same 18 played a different game
altogether, “lining” their opponents at all points, and
ultimately collaring the Junior Premiership by 33 to
ei £ ht ' „ , „
* * * *
During the week, the Ass. published the in
formation that its takings for the two semi-finals and
two finals amounted to £487, of which it annexed a tenth,
handed £47 to charltv, and passed £39 12s. 3d. to each
of the 10 clubs. Also, it informed the lamentable Preston
club that next season would see its last chance.
* t * * *
The League’s net receipts from the four “final”
matches were £4360, of which the Australasian Football
Council took £459, the League £BlO (of this the Sydney
school-boj’s mopped up £110), and the Metropolitan Ass.
£3O ; while £348 was voted to charity, and the 10 clubs
raked in from £250 to £3OO a-piece.
* * . * *
The racing at Henley-on-the-Yarra last Satur-
day was remarkable for the successes of the Banks Club,
of Melbourne. In the Maiden Eights, Junior Fours and
Junior Eights, Banks paddled to the front with anything
from half a boat to two full lengths to spare. Tas-
manian crews were also guilty of two achievements.
The Sandy Bav team won the Maiden Fours by a
length, and the North Esk boat from Launceston secured
the Senior Fours by half a length. Scotch College
(Melb.) just managed to grab the Ladies’ Challenge Cup
(Public Schools crews); but the struggle for the Grand
Challenge Cup (Senior Eights) will have to be further
discussed. On Saturday one of the motor boats that,
infested the course intruded into the final heat, smashed
the University craft, and suspended the race until further
notice.
* * * *
Hugbie Mehegan put it all over Douglas at
Sydney Stadium last week. The first round seemed to
teach Mehegan something ; anyhow, at the beginning of
the next, he emerged from his corner like a well-oiled
bullet, leapt in an umvontedly reckless fashion at his
friend from Africa, and crossed and uppercut him with
infinite fervor and abandon. Africa’s response was gal-
lant but ineffective. In the third round it was apparent
to the meanest intellect and the shortest-sighted eye
that the Dark Continent was doomed. The Melbourne
lad was fresh and strong, while his opponent spat blood,
sagged at the knees and generally presented the
appearance of a Human Ruin. Mehegan, as usual,
either couldn’t or wouldn’t put bis wilting adversary out,
and towards the close of the fourth round “Snowy”
Baker stopped the butchery and bestowed the victor’s
bays—and, incidentally, the Lightweight Championship
of Australia—where they belonged. It was suggested
while the gore was being mopped up that Douglas had
over-trained, and certainly he looked fine-drawn. But it
hardly explained things to the satisfaction of those who
had seen his previous contests with Mehegan, and the
capable scrap he put up against Summers. Mayhap
Douglas is a “ Liberal,” and recent events have preyed on
his health ; it requires some bold theory of the sort to
account for his amazing reversal of form.
BE YOUR OWN DOCTOR.
Prescribe Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills,
and Keep a Bottle in the House.
The doctor is a luxury that thousands and
thousands of people can ill afford. The necessity
of calling one in is considered a calamity in a
family where they find it hard so secure the
common necessities of life and to make ends
meet. Doctors’ fees and chemists’ charges keep
a poor man poor, and discourage the young
married man in his efforts to save and acquire
independence. Sickness is no respecter of persons.
Rich and poor alike are subject to all the common
ailments —disorders of the stomach, liver, kidneys
and blood. In thousands of homes throughout
Australia and New Zealand—in the mansion, the
villa, the cottage, the camp, the homestead, in
the settler’s home and the bushman’s hut—Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills are the household
remedy. They purify the blood, correct the
liver, stimulate the kidneys, and tone up the
stomach and the whole system.

hen B. B. Wise recently gave Wade
the lacing he had been calling tenders for,
he (Wise) said he knew the Bathurst cor-
respondent of the Sydney press would tele-
graph his remarks to the city, but he was
not sure that the Sydney press would publish
them. This made Editor Ward’s whiskers stand
on their hind legs and foam at the mouth. In a
footnote to the message the Telegraph said :
Nobody in New South Wales knows better than Mr.
Wise does that this insulting 1 insinuation about the Sydney
press is absolutely unfouhded. His own experience of
the Sydney press should have held even his reckless
tongue.—Ed. D.T.
And in the very same issue the publication’s lead-
ing article proved Wise’s right to hurl “ insulting
insinuations” and even high-keyed fish at it.
Look at this
All incentive to enterprise and effort would vanish
before the system which infers that all men are equal,
and, therefore, that none can rise above the others.
Already the process of dragooning all down to one dead
level is seen at work in trades unionism, the compelling
force of Labor Socialism.
And smell this
A man may disagree with the finding in this or that
respect; but he must support it with both vote and
money. And in doing this lie is contributing toward his
further downfall as an individual, because the objective of
the. party is to destroy personal property.
The Telegraph is notorious; but it probably
never before went quite so far as it did during
this last State election. It was the desperate,
reckless fight of the long-defeated. But it got its
reward ; on Friday night it had to be the hang-
man of its own cause on the King-street scaffold.
When the Victorian railways began to
supply a daily accident, the Commissioners
rushed in to affirm that it couldn’t possibly be
the permanent way, as that was in a most excel-
lent condition. This was enough to make people
who know the ways of the Department suspect
that the ballasting was not all it should be, and
that the sleepers were too far apart. One corres-
pondent wrote to the Age and told how he had
strolled along the line for 20 chains and found
eight sleepers with broken ends, which were
tilted up anything from 6in. to Sin. This was
near Murtoa, on the line which carries the
Adelaide express. Getting curious, he inspected
another 2200yd5., and found 40 sleepers in
a similar condition. Ballast is not expen-
sive, but, to keep a line in good condi-
tion. so much of it is required that the
bill for getting, carrying and distributing is quite
a large item in the annual working expenses
account. Also, it is a section of the accounts in
which a cheese-paring management is liable to go
to an extreme, as, until an accident takes place, the
public is not likely to be aware of the “economy”;
and accidents can be stalled off for a while by re-
ducing speed. But there comes a time when the
safety-line has been crossed and further progress
that way means a smash. Victoria has apparently
arrived at that time.
A chastened Sydney Telegraph is pre-
pared to take comfort from almost anything just
now. For instance: —
The splendid victory for the Liberal candidate in the ,
second ballot at St. Leonards is a reminder to the
Government that the cause represented by the Opposi-
tion has not yet lost all power of appeal. On a substan-
tially larger poll Mr. Cocks secured almost the same
majority as was accorded hint on the first ballot.
At the first ballot the figures were :
Cl/ARK (Liberal) 1735
Cocks (Liberal) 3382
Down (Labor) 2232
At the second :
Cocks (Liberal) .. .. .. 4443
Down (Labor) .. .. .. .. 3317
In other words, on the second ballot Labor scored
every vote it did on the first, and more than 1000
“Liberal” votes besides. The “Liberal” vote
dropped by 674 and the Labor one rose by
1085, in this one-time Tory electorate where,
three years ago, the entire Labor vote was
only 600. The person who can regard this
sort of thing as “splendid,” is capable of,
giving three hearty cheers because he only
dropped £lOOO over one of the safest investments
in the country, instead of going stone, motherless
broke, as he might have done if things had been,
worse.

Weakness after
illness can be cured
by SCOTT’S
Emulsion
Weakness, acute or chronic, is
permanently cured by taking
Scott’s Emulsion. This
statement is made with con-
fidence, because hundreds of
people have written to say
that they or theirs were cured
of weakness, following upon
one or another illness, by
Scott’s Emulsion. For ex-
ample, Mrs. E. Smith wrote,
30th June, 1909, from 74,
Dowling Street, Paddington,
Sydney, N.S.W.:
“My daughter, aged 12% years, after scar-
let fever, suffered from extreme weakness
and emaciation. I decided on a course of
gh
Scott’s Emulsion and soon
saw a wonderful improvement.
She rapidly ,grew stronger,
and increased in weight, and
noiv, thanks to Scott’s,
she is thoroughly built up
and in splendid health. This
trademark teas on the emul-
sion I bought. ”
If you wish to get rid of weak-
ness and decide to buy
Scott’s Emulsion, decide
also to GET SCOTT’S
EMULSION. You may be
asked to buy another emul-
sion and told it is “just as
good as Sco 11 ’ s.” Substitute
emulsions can only be sold
on the reputation of Scott’s
Emulsion.
Scott’s Emulsion cures the disease-
no matter the age of the patient—and'
will be approved by your Doctor for
Weakness if you ask him.

Mr. R. J. Hinton, Jerrara Creek, Marulan,
N.S.W., writes: —
“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I '
have been completely cured of the Tobacco
Habit by your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after
using tobacco heavily for seven years, sometimes
Boz. to lOoz. in the week. It is now 12 months
since I last used tobacco, and, although I am con-
tinually in the company of smokers, I do not have
the least desire to smoke, therefore I consider
the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my
former complaints, such as irregular Heart
Action, Dizziness, Nervousness and Stomach
Trouble, which I have every reason to believe
were caused through the use of tobacco, have en-
tirely disappeared, and are only remembered as a
hideous nightmare. I eat and sleep well, and feel
tit to face the world again. It will give me great
pleasure to recommend your remedy to others.”

In Every Home
constipation is a recurring complaint that comes sooner or
later, and visits more or less often. It is simple, yet
dangerous if allowed to continue, or the habit be permitted,
for most irregularities have their origin in constipation—
and many diseases too.
California Syrup of Figs is the natural remedy, and one.
that should find a permanent place in every home —ready at
the right moment to help in the right way.
It is suited to all the family, children as well as adults.
The former like it because of its pleasing taste. It is not
a purgative that weakens, but a laxative that cleanses,
soothes, strengthens, and leaves the organs in a fit condition
to perform their necessary functions well. It has already
found a place in millions of homes throughout the world, and
has been endorsed and approved by the medical profession.
No home should be without it.
CALIFORNIA
SYRUP of FIGS
“ NATURE’S PLEASANT LAXATIVE”
You must ask for California Syrup of Figs and look for the
trade mark in blue, also name of the California Fig Syrup Co.,
which appears on every package of the original and genuine.

Business, Robbery, etc.
In England, three years or so ago, they got tired
of the blessings of Freetride as applied to patented
goods, and decided that a patentee shouldn’t be free to
manufacture where he pleased. The Act of 1907 laid it
down that the holder of a British patent must take effec-
tive steps to manufacture in Britain. Since then the
unfortunate British workman has been confronted with
increasing quantities of the work that the foreigner used
to struggle with. Among other goods, all asbestos tiles
were formerly made in France, Germany, or some other
place that wasn’t England ; now the Hatschek patentees
have been glad to make an arrangement with Bell’s
United Asbestos Oo. —a big English concern—and for the
first time these fibrous goods are now made in Britain.

Talk about the craft of the Heathen Chinee !
It is a mere faint circumstance to that of the heathen
Hindu. Out here on the Bellinger, Butter Singh owed
Ram Jam coin and Jam couldn’t get it. ■ Suddenly Butter
left the district, and Ram learned that he was polluting
Armidale. Ram straightway rained a short-notice sum-
mons on Butter, only to discover that the latter had
sailed for India. After a short spell devoted to curses,
blasphemies and loud objurgations, Ram pulled himself
together and sent a cousin of his up to Armidale. This
cousin proceeded to posture publicly as Butter Singh.
“ Ha ! ” said the local policeman, “here’s a bit of blue for
you,” as he served the summons on the false Butter. The
case came before the Court, and verdict was given in
favor of Jam. Butter didn’t appear. The genuine Butter
had a rich uncle in India, and Ram opined that, when
the official proofs of Butter’s debt were sent to this uncle,
somebody would pay up. And thus the artful Ram had
set to work to get the proofs he coveted. Tb put a
finishing touch on the dark deed, Ram became elated
with his success and told the magistrate all about it. The
magistrate hasn’t got over the shock yet.

It looks as though Westralia will have trouble
before long in finding a tree big enough to hang itself
on. Between them, timber and firewood form 54 per
cent, of all the traffic On the State’s railways ; and fire-
wood alone bulks larger than all the coal, coke, ore,
wool, wheat, hay, chaff and dairy and garden produce
put together. The big gold mines are mainly responsible
for the slaughter—the big mines whose mostly-foreign
owners are quite annoyed if they are asked to pay tup-
pence in taxation, and who inquire in surprise whether it
isn’t enough that they “put their capital into the
country.” Which, by the way, they mostly don’t; in 99
cases out of 100 they simply put it into the pocket of
some other foreigner.
* * * *
Melbourne boot-manufacturers are full of bad
language about the continued failure of the police to
capture the leather thieves who have in the last few
years made regular hauls, valued altogether at some
£3OOO. One curious feature of the business is that the
manufacturers feel sure the receiver of the stolen hides
is one of themselves, and most of them say they could put
their hands on the man, but they can’t prove anything.
They don’t complain so much of his thefts as of his unfair
competition. Which recalls the case of that other ex-
ponent of Private Enterprise who complained to a fellow-
manufacturer that a certain competitor was cutting him
out of his business. “ I’m sure the fellow steals his raw
material,” said he. “That doesn’t matter,” replied his
friend. “I steal my goods ready-made, and even then I
can’t beat him.”
* * *
“ Wat-oh!” This notice I met in a boot-shop
window in Thirsty Island:—“Ladies’ shoes will he Re-
paired here if the ladie that is the wearer of the Shoes
brings them to me and intimates if I will repair her Shoes
I will tell her when her Shoes will be Repaired and that
will be the Onely Ladie that will get the shoes when Re-
paired. Ladies’ shoes won’t be Repaired here if they send
them to me by their Acquaintances or Servants. There
are so Many Ladies wish to buy their Shoes elsewhere but
they like to get their shoes repaired here when they get
someone more Forward than themselves to come in here.
All of this class of Ladies are requested to keep their Shoes
out of my Shop.” It is all beautifully characteristic of
the tropical North —the place where the white man has
the habit of saying just what he wants to say and blither
the consequences.
“De Yid”: Queer things women, and the
working of their minds is past all comprehension. Evil-
eyed, and still more evil-minded, Syrians, Chows and
Indians knock at their doors, and they buy their most
blush-producing underwear. John in particular is famed
for these articles, and he carries a frilled and comprehen-
sive assortment. But the averagedamsel who walks into
a small shop in search of lingerie will, nine times out of
10, purchase a totally unnecessary packet of pins, instead
of the goods she really wants, if a man happens to be in
charge. In a large store she makes for the most fatherly,
looking shopwalker and murmurs “ Underclothing” be-
neath her breath, or inquires for the “Lady manager.”
But she tells John or Yusouf or Chunder her wants quite
unconcernedly, and overhauls the garments if she feels so
inclined. Even the old pattern of ferocious respectability
who wears grey flannels and would still buy linsey-
woolsey if she could, is catered for. John is such a
gentleman. So is Yusouf. And, for that matter,
i Chunder too!
SQUANDERING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I love, when the end of the month comes round,
To jingle my coins. What a joyful sound
They make.
I shake
My purse and gloat in miserly glee,
For the sound of my riches is sweet to me,
Although
By the end of the month I will stony be,
I know’.
To spend without stopping to count the cost,
To lose and not care what the devil you’ve lost,
Is great.
I’d hate
To measure in pence every pleasure I’ve bought,
Or squander my substance on things that I ought
To buy.
To get all from my pittance that can be got
I try.
One month on receiving my monthly pay
I stinted and struggled and put away
A quid.
I did
Have plenty of things that I wanted to buy,
But turning my back on temptation I
Abstained.
Though several penniless pals, who were dry,
Were pained.
But never again will I save a bean,
For my pocket was picked by some thief unseen.
I scorn
To mourn
For milk that is spilt, but it makes me sad
To think of the things that I might have had
That day.
And that I may never go miserly mad
I pray.
Now croakers remind me I’ll be some da
Too old to work and withered and gray,
No doubt;
, Without
A penny piece or a stick of my own,
Friendless, poverty-stricken, alone,
And while
They weep for me and mournfully moan,
I smile.
I live in the present. The past is dead :
The future conveniently far ahead.
All day
I stay
Indoors and slave for a miserly fee,
And what if I squander it recklessly ;
’Tis plain
At the end of the month I will wealthy be
Again.

Pianos.
TO INTENDING PIANO BUYERS
Having discovered a piano with the essential qualifications of pure tone and durability
of construction, and with the added advantage of a practical scientific tuning system, you
naturally begin to consider the question of the appearance of the instrument.
You want one that gives some outside indication of its value. There are plenty of
showy pianos to be had, but in our whole range of twenty-four designs we have nothing of
the kind. We have aimed at a high standard of excellence in case designing, and our
models are absolutely correct in detail, whatever the style, whether Renaissance, Rococo,
Empire, or other period. The Beale pianos are art productions' as well as first-class
musical instruments. They were awarded a Gold Medal at the Franco-British
Exhibition by the first furniture experts of Europe for the excellence of the cabinet-work,
and the high quality of workmanship whiih it showed. A Gold Medal was also
awarded for the factory organisation under which such work was produced. With the
exceptional distinction of the Grand Prix (fcjr tonal qualities), and the next highest award,
Diploma of Honor (for patent frame and : tuning system), these coveted prizes are a
greater number of awards than were ever made to one piano manufacturer at any exhibition.

50 years ago the name of Alcocfc was practically unknown —to-day
it is synonymous with billiards. "Why ?
They have always maintained that high standard of excellence,
so scientifically and accurately constructed their tables, cues, etc., that
it is no wonder that the popularity of Alcock T ables has grown so
much.
Gray, who made his wonderful break of 836 —831 coming off the
red —and other prominent players, are prompt to proclaim these tables
as perfect in every respect.

A TIP FOR
THE CUP.
A
TAKE the November number of The Lone
Hand with you ; and even if you lose you’ll
find ample compensation in your sixpen’orth.
F’rinstance, “The First Melbourne Cup,” by
H. C. Coghlan, tells you all about the quaint
beginnings of the big race. The names men-
tioned in this article will interest you, too. It
shows that some of the men interested then are
still prominent in racing nowadays. And “An
’Orsetralian Alphabet,” by Will H. O gilvie,
illustrated by Douglas Fry, is quaintly humorous.
The other articles make this number the best
all-round issue to date. The celebrated scien-
tific writer, Joseph McCabe, whose lectures
throughout Australia aroused unprecedented
interest and some controversy, writes for
The Lone Hand a brilliant scientific, yet
popularly written, article, entitled “Australia —a
Museum of Living An-
tiquities." This article
explains why Australian
trees have their
characteristic foliage, and
why our animals represent
ancient types. A special
art section is devoted to
George W. Lambert, the
Australian artist who is
known here as the painter
of “Across the Black
Soil Plains," but to the
world as a painter of
modern masterpieces. A JAVANESE DANSEUSE ‘
This fully-illustrated appreciation is written by
W. Hardy Wilson. “His Majesty the Nail"
is the title of an account, by S. H. Prior, of the
quaintest potentate in the world, the nominal
ruler of 32,000,000 Javanese. “My Own Boss,
Limited," is the title of the third of the series,
“The Land as a Career," and shows how the
Westralian Government helped a penniless youth
to success. A nature study that is especially
interesting deals with “The Aeronautic Spider" —
the insect that, without wings, learnt to fly. The
“Good Australians," selected for notice this
month, are Alfred Deakin and Miss Rose Scott.
And there are two other articles. The fiction
ranges from a Melbourne detective story
to sentiment and riotous sea-humor.
P.S.—DON’T take it to the Cup: you might miss seeing some
m
ğh
of the races.

A Lady Will Give You Her Secret Free.
For j’ears I have searched for a simple and satis-
factory way to remove superfluous hair from the
skitf, so that it would not return. Experiments
proved to me that the various pastes, powders,
depilatories, electrical appliances, etc., now on the
market were often injurious, and not lasting in
their effects. At last I discovered a plan which suc-
ceeded in producing marvellous, permanent results
where all others failed. A fashionable Parisian
lady who followed my advice says: “My face is
now soft and smooth, and no one would ever think
it had been disfigured by a growth of superfluous
hair.” Others write : “It seems too good to be
true.” Well, the test will tell. No matter bow
much or how little superfluous hair ison yourface,
neck, arms or body, I am confident that you can
now remove it, permanently, and with perfect
safety. I will send full information regarding the
secret of my discovery absolutely free to every
woman who writes at once, but this offer is limited
to a short time only, so do not delay if you wish
to benefit FREE. Address KATHRYN B.
FIRMIN (Dept. 631 A), 85 Great Portland
Street, London, W., England, and you will
receive full particulars by return post in a plain
sealed envelope.

A GENUINE. Rupture Cure !
DON’T WEAR A TRUSS ANY LONGER,
After 30 years’ experience, I have produced an applia.nce ’
Women and Children, that ACTUALLY CURES RUPTURE.
BEWARE OF
IMITATIONS
Certain crude appliances
have been placed on the
Australian Market roughly
modelled after my speciali-
ties, and my very advertise-
ments and literature have
been copied.
If you have been misled
by these, come to me. Where
imitators have failed, theri
I have my greatest success.
WRITE TO ME

Let me send you my Illus-
trated Book, free, showing

“ Dear Sir,—After a year’s
wearing of your famous Rup-
ture Appliance, I can find no
words to express my admira-
tion of such an excellent in-
vention, and the benefit I
have derived from its use.
All that you claim for it
in your book, and all that
your clients have said in its
favor in their printed testi-
monials I can fully bear out
and confirm from person 1
experience. lam sure that
hundreds of your Appliances
would be instantly ordered if
the unfortunate sufferers
only knew of its existence.
For my part, I feel that you
deserve the universal grati-
tude of mankind for invent-
ing such a cheap and in-
fallible remedy for so wide-
spread a complaint, and you
are perfectly free to make
what use you please of what
I say in this letter.
“ Yours faithfully,
“ P. O'CONNOR (Rev.).”
The Brooks’ Appliance is a new scientific discovery, with automatic air cushions, that
draws the broken parts together, and binds them as you would bind a broken limb.
It absolutely holds firmlv and comfortably, and never slips. Always lurht and cool,
and conforms to every movement of the body without chafinjr or hurtinjr. I make it
to your measure, and send it to vou on a strict guarantee of satisfaction or money
refunded, and I have put my price so low that anybody, rich or poor, can buy it.

“ Dear Sir, —Having worn your Appli-
ance from the time it arrived, I think it
my duty to acknowledge that your
Appliance saved my life. Bv wearing a
common steel truss I fell back under 10
stone in weight, and since wearing your
Appliance for the past two months, I
have increased to the weight of 13 stone,
lean now do my heavy work with ease,
and must thank vnu for your kindness
and the straightforward manner you
dealt with me. I shall do all in my
power to recommend your Appliance to
friends around who suffer from this
terrible complaint. You can make what
use you like of this letter, and I will an-
swer with pleasure any letters from those
who would like to know about the
Appliance. Yours truly, S. J, KING.”

You’ve heard men who have a weedy, downy moustache described
with contempt in those words.
A good moustache is the brand of manhood—and CAP ILLARINE

It excites the hair follicles under the skin to activity, and will grow
the slightest “ down ” into strong, vigorous hair.

The N.S.W. Labor majority, numerically
considered, is not stupendous. But the weakest
of majorities may be welded into a tower of
strength by reinforcing its wisdom with the wise
counsels of IXC.L. whisky. When victory hangs
in the balance, triumph may be best secured by a
final rally invigorated by D.C.L. inspiration.*
According to Mr. Low in October Lone Hano,
Ausiralians are not unwilling to be convinced that they
are equal to any human goods produced in any other
country. Also, they are rapidly learning that goods made
in the Commonwealth by Australians, such as the under-
wear of the Australian Knitting Mills, are also worthy of
the highest appreciation. This same excellent under-
wear, it is worthy of note, is made by the mills aforesaid
entirely from wool grown and spun in this festive Aus-
tralia of ours.*
There are only two classes of men in the com-
munity who can afford to despise dress—the genius and
the millionaire. As both species are extremely rare, it
follows that the rest of us should be well dressed. There
was a time when to be well dressed meant being extra-
vagant, and addicted to scat.ter-cash habits. That day
has passed. It really costs no more to be well dressed
than to be garbed in slovenly fashion. The question is to
know how to do it. And that is a matter on which the
average man is totally ignorant, just as he is upon
law, medicine and a thousand other things. But
when a man requires law he goes to an expert,
and, if he is wise, gets the best. So it is in
the matter of dress. And on this subject no
man can do better than go to Farmer’s, of Pitt,
George and Market Streets, Sydney. There he will find
five experienced and highly-qualified cutters, assisted by
a trained' staff, who will dress him as he should be
dressed. And when a man has three or four good suits
adapted for all the occasions of life, they last him as long,
and even longer, than one or two suits worn on every T
possible occasion, and, moreover, save him from many
acts of bad taste. Farmer’s do their work thoroughly,
and their great output enables them to do it at the
lowest prices possible, consistent with the maintenance
of high quality. Further, the customer at Farmer’s has
the rare boon of being able to choose his materials bv
direct daylight, an advantage that is as rare as it is
satisfactory.*
IN BANANA LAND
Sample of notice which nowadays fre-
quently drops in on the sugar-farmer:—
Victoria Mills. —Messrs. So-and-So. Owing to the
large stock of cane at the mills, I would ask you to stop
cutting on Saturday. I regret being unable to send you
the trucks ordered this week. iN'ext week, however the
position may be better.
the fact tiiat the mills can’t keep pace with him
shows, of course, that the white man can’t work
in the Northern canetields.
“ Maginnis Magee ” : That recent ride of
the Kidman girls across country with dad is a big
enough thing in its way, but the record isn't
beaten yet. Somewhere about 1892 Mrs. Knox,
ot Charters Towers—formerly Miss Fitzgerald, of
Winton—hearing of her mother’s dangerous ill-
ness, left the Towers for Hughenden, and on
reaching the latter town borrowed a horse and
started to ride the other 155 miles to Winton.
She didn’t change horses during the trip, stopped
only twice on the road for refreshment, and fin-
ished the job in 24 hours.
“S.R.”: The mention by “Mario”
(29/9/TO) of the rumored discovery of goid at
Brisbane, on the site of the new Government
House, recalls the rush to Victoria Park.
At that time, Brisbane was not as big as
it is now, and ■ what is Victoria Park was
then Government Reserve. Someone picked
up a piece of gold m a hole in the reserve,
and immediately pegged out a claim. Presently
the news was tearing round the town that a
new Bendigo had opened business within
a mile of the G.P.0., and in the scram-
ble for miners’ rights several people were
nearly trampled to death. Within 24 hours
every inch of the reserve was pegged out, and
within 21 days the prospects had petered out. I
think that loz. 17dwt. was the gross amount of
gold that was discovered, and how it came there"
it couldn’t explain. It certainly didn’t grow
there, because a careful and laborious search was
made for its roots. • The holes of investigation are
visible yet.
“ Ossian,” about a bad old practice :
“ Where fees are paid to counsel it is usual to include
therein certain fees to which his cieik is entitled, and
which can be recovered from counsel by the clerk for
money had and received.” So writes Halsbury in his
“Laws of England.” In Queensland the scale is pre-
scribed by Rule of Court. Counsel here has sufficient
leisure to do his own clerical work, or he passes if. over to
his “devil” ; hence, as the clerk is a fictilious personage
in these parts, the “gratuity ” does not get beyond his
master's clutches. It is a fairly handsome sum, running
up to 2£ percent, of the fee on brief. It is also paid on
consultations and conferences, as well as on common and
general retainers. In the latter case the clerk’s fee is
10s. fid. Where the fee is accepted by Counsel who has
no clerk, it looks so much like obtaining money by false
pretences that the difference doesn’t matter. And the
offence is frequent. I have not yet seen a Counsel’s
clerk in any of the chambers in Brisbane ; the most I
have seen is a sort of errand boy, who fills in spare
time in such clerical work as noting up statutes,
reports, etc., and I’ve never heard of him, getting r.he
clerk’s fee. Various horse-haired gentlemen say plainly
that the whole practice should be abolished ; and, though
Costs is certain to dissent, it’s about up to the learned
brethren on the Bench to run a rake through the Rules
of Court which sanction the piracy.
Yachtsman Tom Welsby, of Brisbane,
who h is made Moreton Bay his hobby, has re-
called Dr. L ing’s explanation of how St. Helena
—Brisbane’s prison island—got its name. It
seems that there was a notorious local Binghi
nicknlined Napoleon; and for some offence he
was put off on to this sandpatch. Hence St.
Helena. Later, a prison was built there; but
Webby wants to get it shifted so that the place
may be turned into a national park.
Brisbane Water and Sewerage Board is
being cursed from Beersheba to Dan by the legions
of idle Fat, on account of a recent decision to
charge water rates on unimproved land value.
Hitherto the rates have been levied on floorage,
and the owners of thousands of vacant lots, -whose
value has been immensely appreciated by the
extension of water mains, have entirely escaped
taxation. Under the new system they will pay—
hence the howl!
’Possum-poisoning is such a good business
in p ir.ts of Queensland that there has been a
shortage of labor for the maize harvesting.
Thereupon one cheerful individual writes
the Courier, suggesting that the Govern-
ment should rigidly preserve the ’possum
—out of regard, not for the ’possum, but
for cocky. The time will yet come when the
same person will call on the Government to put
down Judkins, not because the person believes in
pubs, but because he is short of a hand to feed his
poddy calves.
THE FOUNT OF LEARNING.
“ Well, Johnny, and what did you learn at Sunday-
school to-day ?”
" Oh, that last niyht’s ’ERALD made a bloomer, ’cos Smithers only kicked one goal and not Jour.”
The “ news ” which the Sydney Telegraph
recently dug out of the mould of the last Imperial
Conference, that “ the base of the Imperial navy
m Australasia is to be removed from Sydney to
A uckland in 1912,” and the comment of the paper
that “Sydney may be able tosecure the presence of
a Commonwealth destroyer, and possibly a cruiser,
but the amount of money spent here will be insig-
nificant compared with that which would be spent
by the Royal Navy,” receives the retort disastrous
from the Wellington (M.L.) Dominion. Says that
journal:—
To the Telegraph, apparently, it is madness to provide
one’s own defence because of the loss of profit from sell-
ing vegetables to the hired man.
The Telegraph did not mention that, under the
new defence arrangements in the Pacific, “the
base of the Imperial navy in Australasia” will
consist of not more than two Second-Class erasers
of the Bristol type (about 5000 tons) and five of
the mackerel vessels of the China squadron, to be
stationed at Auckland in time of peace. In time
of war there is no arrangement that anything at
all will be stationed there—unless it is a squadron
of the enemy.
The Backward Road.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
~V7S"T~ILL no one find me the Backward
- ,yy Road—
The Road that runs into Yesterday ?
It winds along with a hedge of green,
Its vistas dip in a golden sheen.
It curves away in the morning fair,
And yet its fields have an olden air—
And creeping down to the distant sky,
In wondrous glamor it wanders by—
The Road that runs into Yesterday !
I dreamt I went by the Backward Road
And dipped a-down into Yesterday ;
I heard the song that the fairies sing,
I saw the elves in a grassy ring ;
I saw, as if in an elfin glass,
Titania’s court and her much-loved ass ;
I found the cave of the lurking gnome,
I caught the dwarf in his mountain home—
The Road it ran into Yesterday !
And as I followed the Backward Road,
The Road that ran into Yesterday,
I caught a glimpse of a goat-foot man,
I heard the sound of the pipes of Pan,
I saw the nymph in the woodland stream,
I caught the flash of a wondrous dream,
And glen and forest arid mountain glade
Were gay with frolic of youth and maid—
The Road, it ran into Yesterday !
If I could pick up the Olden Road,
The Road that runs into Yesterday,
I’d soon be friends with the wights of old,
With Joan the Good and with Charles the Bold,
With the Long-legged King and the Virgin
Quepn,
With Robin and John and their archers green
But I seek and seek it in vain alway,
For no one knows where it winds, they say—
Tne Road that runs into Yesterday.
Perhaps I’d drift with the Backward Road,
8o far, at least, into Yesterday,
That Days of Youth for an hour were mine,
The golden dusk and the dawn divine,
The morning hug and the bedside kiss,
The sweet caress of maternal bliss,
The gentle joy and the soft repose—
But, alas and alas ! not a mortal knows
Tne Road that runs into Yesterday.
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 22, 1910.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
At the risk of becoming tedious, I must repeat
that the local clerk of the weather is no gentle-
man. His latest effort was to do his best to spoil
a river trip given to the Scotch Commission by
Wee Macgregor ; but General Jollity came to the
rescue and foiled him. The party was to have
had a moonlight run up the wonderful St. Lucia
and upper reaches, but the gathering clouds and
electricity in the wrong place turned it into a
lightning display, and as such it was a top-side
success. On board the Boko the Haggis broke
loose, and, running amok, finished up in the
engine-room, where it was finally beaten off with
a spanner.
Don’t, for all the gold in the Federal Treasury,
divulge the secret; but our Town Hall is, accord-
ing to the most reliable authority, to be finally
put through on the last day of this month. Plans
and specifications will, it seems, slip through the
City Council like oiled lightning, and then heigh-
ho for the stone of much contention, which will,
after all, be decorated with the name of tactful
Hetherington.
The first sod of the Rosewood-Marburg rail-
way, the line that saved Dinny Keogh’s
vote to the Government a while ago, will not,
it seems, he turned without the presence of a
crumpled roseleaf or so. In the first place,
Paget, M.P., who for the time being administers
Agriculture and Railways, was asked to do the
deed. Then the chief clansman, who has a real
sympathy with the man on the land, remarked
that he would like to be there; and Keogh,
grasping the opportunity, invited him to come
along and do a little pick-and-snovel work. Sub-
sequently, it was explained that arrangements
had been made with Paget ; whereupon, not to
cause unpleasantness, the Governor decided to
deny himself the pleasure. So the Minister will
be able to dig in peace, with all the limelight
streaming upon him.
The wedding of a pretty girleen, Evelyn de
Winton, is imminent. The lady is the grand-
daughter of the late Robert Little, a pioneer
lawyer of this State ; and Canon Jones, who tied
up the bride’s mother, is expected to do the same
for the daughter.
I see that the balance of the Ella Caspers fund,
some £7O, ts going a-begging because of the shaft
of Cupid ; and I wonder whether the committee
would like to help little Vera Parker to some
further culture of that wonderful contralto of
hers. She’s a Sydney native, with some notes
that would return a wonderful dividend in hard
cash and national credit. Brisbane would assist.
Mrs. Nall, an amiable lady with a doctor hus-
band, is shortly quitting these parts; wherefore
she was tea-d by half a hundred neighbors on
Friday afternoon. Incidentally, the guest acquired
a duck of a necklace, in which opals and soft green
tourmalines and pearls—all Queensland stones,
you understand—played a part. The recipient
was fittingly overcome.
Fierce waxes the controversy over the merits of
the Butterfly of Bel Sorel and Amy. Amy is too
—well, “ blousey ” —and did ever a Jap wear her
hair in frayed sausages! Otherwise she is an
excellent Insect. The shape of Blarney is also
against him, and he wants more hair-cut and less
belladonna in his eye. Otherwise well and very
well. Roberts, as Pinkerton, is a decidedly more
likely officer, and his voice has seemingly been
renovated inside and out. Ze little Buckman, as
Bel calls her, charms everyone; and Arthur
Crane’s silent sympathy is herewith patted on the
back.
Beatrice Grimshaw has dropped in from good-
ness knows where, after dallying for a year or
more in Papua, writing and getting ready to
write. She looks strong and well, and has
nothing but good to say of what used to be con-
sidered a fever-stricken island.
Another home-comer is Mrs. Abraham Hertz-
berg, after doing a time of times in Europe.
Brisbane has no tears to shed over the decline
and fall of the Church Fete. Five of them took
place last Saturday, and only one could be called
successful. Now for some new horror !
There are interesting details in the report of
Dr. Health Commissioner Elkington, who tells us
that over 146 tons of foodstuff had been destroyed
in the State during the year as “quite unfit.”
And that Brisbane paid about £2500 for water
retailed at 4d. a quart, under the shallow disguise
of milk.
Premier Kidston is holding out a hand to the
committee of the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Fund,
and it seems likely that at last Brisbane will rear
some monument to the Queensland boys whose
lives were sacrificed in the S’African shame. The
latest idea is a sort of Triumph Gate for the
Botanical Gardens. Our Brisbane boy, Harold
Barker, will probably have his sculptor’s hand in
rhe business. And, while upon the subject of
statues, it occurs to me what a very excellent like-
ness is the bust, by Watts, of the late C. E.
Bernays, for 50 years the Clerk of Parliament,
which has been placed recently at the entrance to
the visitors’ gallery.
Brisbane’s Mr. John Forrest is not, it seems, on
the point of booking for the Old World. He had
already bespoken passages, but business said,
“Not yet.”
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
About three years ago Gibson Bros., of
Bingera plantation, near Bundaberg (Q.), acting
on the advice of Dr. Gibson, one of the family,
and now Superintendent of Queensland Sugar
Experiment Stations, got fowls to help them fight
the destructive cane beetle. The experiment has
been a great success. The ebooks are put to work
scratching for a living in newly-ploughed ground,
and are taken from place to place in fowlhouses
on wheels. At present there are about 300 of
them on the job, and, besides getting rid of the
grubs, they earn enough at egg-laying in their
spare time to pay the wages of the nurses who
wheel their perambulators.
The Chief Protector of Queensland abo-
rigines pays the following tribute to the Northern
Chows:—
Natives are freely used by Chinese in farming opera-
r.ioris, and payment is made in rice and opium. More-
over, the Chinese use the native women for immoral pur-
poses, and altogether a most undesirable state of things
exists. The natives on C dar Creek are a fine stamp of
people, strong, healthy and intelligent. At present the
p >sition is that the Chinese are gradually killing off the
natives with opium and disease.
And the wicked Labor party wants to keep these
hard-working, honest, desirable people from
coming to the country !
The Dalby-Catfele Creek railway —a guaran-
teed line which refuses to pay expenses—is a
source of trouble to Bananaland railway people.
Under the Act, the people in the benefited area
must make good the losses, and the guarantee
railway (which is a fine thing so long as it pays)
has run on to the corns of the landowners there-
about. The shire councils refused to appoint a
valuator; so Commissioner Thallon appointed
one for them. By grim persistence and a lot of
“final demands,” the railway boss has raised
£785, leaving £llBl still owing. While the
wrangling has gone on, and bits of paper have
flitted about the country, a fresh year with a
fresh deficit has arrived ; and the fresh deficit
means the old troubles all over again.

In purchasing a Motor Car, Motor Cycle or Cycle, the part most frequently overlooked is the tyres.
The wise buyer, however, always makes a close examination of the tyres. If it is a Motor Car he is buying he makes quite sure, not
only that the tyres are large enough to carry the car without frequent troubles, but that they are reliable in quality, dependable
in wearing powers and of sound construction.
If he has had close experience with the tyre question, he says “ CONTINENTALS,” and no amount of persuasion will change
his decision. m() /MODEL DE COURSE SQUARE TREADS.
Motorists should make a point of inspecting the new Model de Course Continental Square Tread lyre (the nearest approach to
tyre perfection yet attempted), with its reinforced b=ads and walls and vastly improved casings.

Suffered Intense Pain for 3 Years—
Skin Inflamed and Covered with
Scales—Limb Badly Swollen,
with Terrible Itching and Burning.
CURED BY CUTICURA WHEN
ALL ELSE HAD FAILED
"Previous to using Cuticura I suf-
fered intense pain for three years from
eczema on my leg, from
the knee down. It be-
gan from a small spot
the size of a penny
piece and broke in a
watery way oyer the
ankles. It spread
rapidly to the knee. It
looked like an erup-
tion. the skin red and
inflamed and covered
with a coating of scales.
The leg became very
swollen, with a terrible itching and
burning sensation. In this way I suf-
fered for the three years. I assure you
I have tried all kinds of remedies and
consulted several medical men. In
fact I tried almost every kind of treat-
ment one could mention, but all to no
avail. My disease was as bad or worse
than ever until I tried Cuticura. After
a few applications I felt relief and I
continued until cured. Now thanks to
Cuticura, I can walk about with ease
and comfort, the itching is gone and
my leg is its normal size.
“I recommended the Cuticura Rem-
edies to a friend who had suffered from
eczema twenty-seven years. He has
commenced the use of Cuticura and is
rapidly getting cured. Richard Barrett,

Two Remarkable Cases
OF STOMACH AND LIVER DISORDER
CURED BY
Mother Seigel’s Syrup
Throughout Australia, indeed the whole of the British Empire, it
would be difficult to find a village, or even a street of over twenty
houses, in wdiich there do not reside persons who frankly state that
they owe their present good health to the old and w^orld-famous remedy,
Mother Seigel’s Syrup. The extent to which this well-known remedy
is used as a regular family medicine, for all those troublesome ailments
which arise from stomach or liver disorders, w 7 ould be surprising w r ere
it not for the fact that this root and herb extract has established itself
as a popular favourite, by reason of the remarkable cures it has effected
all over the w T orld. Here are two cases in point :
A world-famous trainer of Gym-
nasts and Athletes, Mr. James De
Grasse, of 82, Herbert Street, Spring
Hill, Brisbane, writing to the pro-
prietors of Mother Seigel’s Syrup,
on Feb. 10, 1910, says:—
“ Shortly after my arrival in Australia
in 1885, I began to suffer terribly from
that scourge of humanity—lndigestion.
It was caused, I think, by the strain of
constant travelling, badly-cooked meals
at hotels, and the after-effects of hard
training. At first, I only had a vague
uneasiness—a slight feeling of distress
after eating. Gradually, the symptoms
became more numerous and, at length,
I began to suffer so severely after meals,
that I had to give up meat, vegetables,
sweets, etc., and take to a diet of milk,
eggs, and stale bread.
“ But even this frugal fare did not save
me from attacks of the most painful kind.
I was often seized with sharp, stabbing
pains around my heart that almost took
my breath away. At other times, I felt
as though something was pressing on my
heart, preventing its free action. I also
had violent palpitation. I feared I had
some form of heart disease.
“ I tried many medicines, but got no
benefit from any of them; and my attacks
became so bad that once I almost fainted
in the sti'eet. I staggered into a
herbalist’s shop and had a draught,
the herbalist telling me that I had
severe Indigestion.
“Later on, a valued friend of mine,
after hearing details of my illness, said
4 You try Mother Seigel’s Syrup. I am
certain it will cure you, as it has cured
me.’ I laughed at first, but he gave me
a bottle containing a few doses and made
me promise to take them. Just to keep
my word, I took the Syrup, and to my
surprise, after the fourth dose, I felt a
decided improvement. Thus encouraged,
I used bottle after bottle, until I had
taken about seven bottles of Mother
Seigel’s Syrup in all.
“ By that time, I had regained all the
weight I had lost during my illness
and' was ’permanently cured of those
distressing pains at my heart and all
my other symptoms of Indigestion .”
OI equal importance is the case
of a well-known nurse. In a letter
dated Dec. 12,1909, Nurse Ashby, 80,
Carrington St., Adelaide, writes:—
“ Some two years back, i:i consequence
of over-work, my h alth began to fail. I
was completely ‘run-down’ and fit for
nothing. My liver got out of order and
became very sluggisti. I was bilious,
unable to eat, and so dizzy and nervous
that I was afraid to venture out of doors
alone. My eyes became dull, and my
complexion quite sallow. I felt I didn’t
care what happened to me. Medical
trie ds said an operation would probably
be nece sary.
“Then an old school-friend siid :
‘ Why not try Mother Seigel’s Syrup ! 1
I did so, and in a couple of weeks I was a
well woman once more. Another friend
actually said to me, ‘Why, Nurse! you
look ten years younger than you did a
fortnight ago,’ and I replied ‘Mother
Seigel’s Syrup h as m tde all the difference. ’
“ I most heartily recommend Mother
Seigel’s Syrup to help women and to pre-
vent their suffering at the change of life,
and also as a good, reliable family remedy
for all everyday complaints. A bottle of
Mother Seigel’s Syrup should be at hand
in every home in case it is wanted.”
Such letters as these are received, almost daily, by the Proprietors ol
Mother Seigel’s Syrup, not only from Australia, but from all over the
world, and they atford conclusive proof that Mother Seigel’s Syrup is a
sure cure for stomach and liver troubles. The fact that Mother Seigel’s
Syrup, for forty years, has cured men and women of these ailments, even
after all ordinary medicine has failed, should convince you that this
herbal remedy possesses curative properties not found in any other
medicine. Indeed, the extracts of roots, barks and leaves of which Mother
Seigel's Syrup is made possess, in combination, the power of toning up
and strengthening the organs of digestion as nothing else does. Test it
yourself l Take the Syrup daily, after meals.
ANTINEURASTHIN
is a nerve food. It cures by feeding and strengthening
the nerves, and not—as in the case of drugs—by stimu-
lating or deadening, bet this point be clearly under-
stood. Antineurasthin is a food—not a drug. The
sufferer from hysteria, from languor, headache, melan-
cholia, insomnia, nervous dyspepsia, neuralgia, or any of
the troubles coming under the head of Neurasthenia,
are each and every one suffering from a lack of the
material of which the brain and nerve system are
nourished and built up, and that material is Lecithin
which alone can supply the nerves with their indispen-
sable nourishment.
Antineurasthin feeds the brain and brain centres with
Lecithin in an active organic state, and is the only means
known to science of doing this.
A sample of Antineurasthin and treatise on nerve
troubles will be posted to any address in Australia or
New Zealand on receipt of one shilling in postal note or

Demi-r. . The Lament of the Wowser” is a drv and
ragged rhyme. You owe us a bottle of whisky for'read-

narrative, and one of the.jokes is so ancient that it casts
the shadow of suspicion over the others Zero:
That’s about it! ...LeoE.: Church-bell clatter muffled
in the basket... C.V.E. : Shearing rhyme too rough....

There is no law in N.S.W. by which a man may secure
the books of a bankrupt for the purposes you mention.

bought the same before it burst. If he only decided on
securing the business after it burst, the books go to the

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use ; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache —a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.

Noted Cyclists Recommend Dr.
Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment.
Mr W Arnst the famous winner of the great Road Race, Timaru to Christchurch, and
Mr A B L Smith who in the same race was the “ fastest time” hero (doing the journey
from Timaru to Christchurch in shr. 30min. 27 4-ssec thereby lowering the record by nearly
47 minutes and gaining the coveted Blue Ribbon of New Zealand), are certainly two of the
most promising tncyoleriders of the day, and New Zealand justly feels proud of them. These
two gentlemen are now contesting the honors for supremacy in Australia, and their words of
b advice and recommendation, as given in
the two following letters, will be as
interesting to the general public as to
other cyclists and athletes generally.
Their letters are as follow
“ During my training I have been using a
considerable amount of Dr. Sheldon’s Mag-
netic Liniment, and am writing to tell you
what a wonderful embrocation I have found
it to be. For making the muscles pliable, it
is excellent, and for taking out the stiffness
resulting from over-exertion it is wonder-
ful. . . 1 have recommended it to many
other cyclists, for I consider that it is a
remedy which should be used by every
athlete.
“W. ARNST.”
“ I have been a user of Dr. Sheldon’s
Magnetic Liniment for some time, and it
has been of the greatest assistance to me
in my training. I have used it as an em-
brocation with wonderful results, and it
has been of the greatest help In getting
me into good condition. . . For removing
any soreness after long, sustained riding
it is invaluable, and I can heartily recom-
mend it to all athletes.
“A. B. L. SMITH.”

A. B. L. SMITH.
Cvclists and other athletes will find Dr. Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment of the greatest use
in room. As a rub-down for strains, soreness and tired muscles, it is unsurpassed,
nuickly removing all stiffness resulting from over-exertion. Dr. Sheldon s Magnetic Liniment
is totally different from any other Liniment on the market, and contains rare products not
ore vioSy employed in like preparations. It will penetrate to your very bones soothe soften
and subdue alfaches and pains. It is an antiseptic and germicide of the highest order. It
is obtainable from all Chemists and Stores at Is. 6d. and 3s or will be sent free 'ipon receipt
of the price by the Sheldon Drug Co., Ltd., 15 O’Connell Street, Sydney, N.S.W.

Here
is the Hub
of Many Merits,
so called because it embodies in one shell
a high gear for the level, a low gear for the
hill, a free wheel on both gears, and a brake of
absolute efficiency. It was the first hub to demonstrate
the practicability of such a combination, and is to-day the
only one that has successfully and consistently accom-
plished all that has been claimed for it. It is known all over the
world as the
Eadie Two-speed Coaster
and is now manufactured at the famous B.S.A. Works. You know what that
means, you know the world-wide reputation of B.S.A. Goods. If you are an expert
cyclist you are pretty sure to be riding a B.S.A. Bicycle yourself and know the
value of the B.S.A. Trade Mark.
Any dealer can fit the Eadie Two-speed Coaster to your bicycle. If you have any
difficult? or would like particulars of these and other B.S.A. goods, write for the
latest B.S.A. Handbook (just out) to

The Last of the Glyptodons.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HEAVY with years was the glyptodon, and
huge was the hulk he had built
-By good fat fare in the marish grass and
the weeds of the river-silt;
His back like a weathered boulder, armored,
rounded and grey ;
Immune was he from a thousand ills, and the
creatures that slay and prey.
In the bulb of the spinal ganglia that served the
beast for a brain
Had flickered a kind of reason, nebulous, vague
and vain;
The ghosts of the generations whence he was the
final link ;
A shadowy phase of the senses forecasting the
brains that think.
On his sinuous neck protruding his head from his
carapace,
His eyes, age-bleared and yellowed, gazed
vacantly into space ;
Earth was a riot of verdure, and strange growths
clawed the trees;
But the beast was weary of all things. It had
drunk its life to the lees.
The beast was weary of all things—the sun and
the wind and the rain.
Its armor had held it scathless, and little it knew
of pain ;
It was sick of the night and morning, it was tired
of earth and sky,
ft had grown to a useless hugeness, and now it
was fain to die.
Then this was the misty musing that surged in
its ancient head—
The residue of the ages, of the long, slow lines of
its dead,
Collected and stored in the nerve-cells, and passing
from life to life—
Ere it sank in the stagnant peat-bed, and out of
the coil and strife.
“A long, long time to grow old in. Length of
years on the earth.
The building up of a body from the small begin-
nings of birth.
To satisfy old desires ; to eat and drink, and to
die,
That the knitted cells shall be broken, and the
useless mass laid by.
“ Not only the huge red mammoth, but all of the
lesser things—
The worm in the oily ooze-bed, the moth with the
painted wings,
The howling shapes in the jungle, the snakes that
coil in the sun—
Are all of them made to be unmade, each of them,
every one.
“ One takes long years in the making, and slow is
his bulk’s decay ;
And one is born with the sunrise, and dies with
the death of day.
Life, and the brunt of action, the movement of

And death and disintegration are ever the sum

‘I, the last armored monster of an old titanic
type,
Cumbrous with age and hugeness, like a fruit that
is over-ripe,
Go down to rot in the mudbanks, hidden with
drift and slime,
My vast shell empty hereafter, and void till the
end of time.
“A pigmy species may flourish in the ferments of
earth anew,
When the glyptodon knows no longer the chaos of
green and blue ;
But fin and feather and fur, and the gnats like
motes in the sun,
They all are made to be unmade, each of them,
every one ! ”
The great folk, wearied of greatness, and all of the
lesser things,
There is no truce to their making, and each to his
structure dings ;
But time, and the coil is over, and the dance of
existence done —
They all are made to be unmade, each of them
every one.

’Possums.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ONE of the main night diversions of the
bush is ’possum shooting, especially on
selections. Many a mile I have tramped
on moonlight nights, when a boy, carrying the
ammunition-bag and sometimes a gun of iny own,
wading ltnee-deep through dew-wet grass, over
gullies and along thickly-timbered ridges, occa-
sionally treading on a snake while sidling blindly
round a tree, mooning the branches. There were
more ’possums than habitable trees, and we often
found a homeless one in the daytime squeezed
under a sheet of loose bark, coiled in a leafy bush,
or in a corner of the house ; and one morning we
found one asleep on top of the bed-curtain. Aunt
Becky hoisted him with the broom-handle, and
he fell on the cosmetics, and broke the looking-
glass jumping at his own reflection. Finally, he
disappeared through the chimney with soot in his
eyes and pomatum on his whiskers. We found
them, too, under the rafters in the barn ; and now
and again we came across one that had been keep-
ing bad hours, treading dejectedly home through
the wet grass, and another blinking drowsily
in the sunlight, having had a hard fight with a
gohanna and been forcibly ejected from his hollow.
He is lucky to be only ejected ; when the long,
striped invader looks in at his door, his chance of
being at to-night’s concert is pretty small. The
agonised shrieks that break out suddenly in gum
forests tell of tragedies enacted in hollow spouts.
When the nearest neighbor lives miles away,
and the town lights are further still, and a be-
lated paper comes along once a week, the even-
ings are tiresomely long, and so a ramble in the
moonlight with the dogs is pleasant pastime. The
dogs like it. They rush off with their noses to
the ground until they strike the scent, or put up
a ’possum that has been honeymooning between
trees Under the purring animal they squat and
E at intervals, until the shooters come on
the scene. It is more comfortable and satis-
factory to wander slowly and aimlessly along
till the dogs bark than to do ones own
hunting for much mooning tells severely on
the neck You want to know your dog, however.
There is the dog that barks at owis and at any-
thing in hollow logs or in burrows ; the dog that
barks only once at a tree, and if not found 1
few minutes will leave it to hunt for another , the
specialising dog, whose bark indicates the nature
of his quarry ; the brute that becomes frantically
excited whenever he finds anything, if it is only a
jew lizard or a flying mouse, and w > ll yelp con-
tinuously till morning, if need be ; and *he fool
mongrel that goes two miles off, then sits barking
under a tree that has nothing in it, and, as soon
as vou come up to him, trots off wagging his tail
as "though he enjoyed the joke. And, besides
having faith in your dog, it is necessary for the
dog to have faith in you. If you cant see the
’possum that he has discovered, and pass on. or
can’t shoot it when you do see it, the dog becomes
a disgusted animal.
Arrived at the tree, you get it between you and
the moon, and, searching first the lower Inn os,
graduallv work up to the higher branches, until
the game is discovered. Possy usually sits very
still, mostly in a fork, during this operation;
though sometimes he remains boldly exposed,
purring defiantly at dog and man. The pointed
ears and frosted-like outline of the furry body
show clearly against the face of the moon, and
make a good target. The animal is easily shot;
and a dog kills him with a few shakes. Yet he
fights valiantly with tooth and claw while he can
—tights and squeals till the life is worried out of
him ; and, when the dog lets go to shake the fur
from his mouth and get a fresh grip, the wounded
victim sits back, sparring with his hands and
hissing, his little pink nose quivering, his large
luminous eyes staring and terror-stricken. He is
a pretty little animal, and to kill him for mere
sport is brutal. In captivity he is gentle and
amusing, and, but for his nocturnal habits, would
be a universal favorite.
Hundreds of thousands were shot on the north-
eastern rivers by the early settlers, merely for
sport, the animals being left to rot under the trees
where they fell, or to be eaten by crows and eagle-
hawks next day. But the ’possum is a good doer
while he has plenty of trees, and hundreds of men,
women and children engage yearly in trapping for
market in this same quarter. One man on the
Richmond River in 1902 accounted for 250 a week,
his record being 63 in one night; and, in the
Manilla district, two men snared 3560 in two
months. Some boil the carcases and feed them to
pigs and fowls. Many white men eat them, roast-
ing them in their skins on the coals ; and during
protracted droughts, when cattle and sheep are
hard to get, they figure on many a backblock table.
In such instances, they are plucked, stuffed and
roasted like sucking pigs. They are palatable,
the euealyptie odor being the only objection. To
the aborigines they were a national asset, pro-
viding a leading article of diet and beautiful
rugs. It has often occurred to me that it
would be profitable to domesticate and improve
the animal, and shear him at the end of winter
when the fur is long. Thousands of pounds are
paid for rabbit fur for making felt hats, and one
’possum is equal to several rabbits. With light
machines, the shearing would be a simple matter.
The difficulty would be to muster them.
The farmer’s pet aversion is the black ’possum ;
that of the professional shooter, the ringtail,
which can’t be depended on to fall, even when
killed outright. I saw nine shots fired into one
that hung by the tail under a limb ; and it hung
there for two days afterwards. I have also known
the common or brown ’possum to hang a con-
siderable time when wounded. Some people aver
that it will feign death, by hanging thus, when
practically unhurt; but this is only one of the
many fairy tales with which old hands were wont
to entertain the gullible newehum. The ’possum
has no cunning. If it escapes severe injury when
fired at, it will scamper up to a higher branch,
or spring into an adjacent tree. I have seen
an odd one get into his hole in record time, when
he happened to be in his home tree; but even
that common-sensible idea is not characteristic of
him.
The best time for shooting or trapping for skins
is winter, and to those who follow the pursuit for
a living, tramping from tree to tree in the cold,
freezing hours of early morn, it is anything but
sport. On the Upper Clarence, in the winter of
1902, a man named Barton had both feet frost-
bitten, and had to crawl several miles for assist-
ance. He was found in a starving condition, and
subsequently had his feet amputated.
The usual ’possum trap is a simple device —
a pole set at an angle against frequented trees,
and having attached a copper wire with a running
noose. Some use ordinary fencing-wire, curved
to carry a noose of strong cord. The animal
prefers the slope of the pole to the perpendicular
tree-trunk, with the result that he puts his head
confidingly into the noose. When caught the
jerk throws him off the pole, and he is thus duly
scragged. A stranger riding through a trapping
area in the morning, and observing the animals
hanging by their necks all around him, might
well stare and wonder.
The ’possum is not very widely distributed
through Australia, being found mainly along the
east coast, and not very far inland. A couple of
species, however, are found in W.A.; while the
black ’possum (Phalangista vulpina), which has a
fine glossy fur and bushy tail, belongs to Tas-
mania. North Queensland has many pretty
species, including the striped ’possum (Dactylop-
sila trivirgata), which extends to Papua. The
Herbert River country has two dark species in
the sombre ’possum (Pseudochirus lemuroides) and
the Herbert River ’possum (P. herbertensis), both
differing much from the common species. I have
also caught some black specimens of the ring-
tailed ’possum on the Richmond River.
The favorite trees of the ’possum seem to be the
gum, apple ( Angophora subvelutina), ironbark
and box. They are not, however, strictly vege-
tarian. While travelling in different parts of
Queensland, and camping out at night, I often
had my tucker bag dragged away from my head
and rifled by ’possums. They would gnaw or tear
a hole through it, and sample everything it con-
tained. So inquisitive are they in this respect
that I have seen them lapping cold tea out of the
billycan. They are gluttons for sugar, and have
also a decided penchant for damper and cooked
corned beef. They are likewise fond of grain,
lucerne, nuts and fruit. At many bush camps it
is necessary to hang all tucker to wires run
through inverted jam tins to escape these noc-
turnal marauders.
While making some watering places for cattle
on Serpentine Lagoon, near Casino, we were
nightly pestered by ’possums gambolling over our
bark gunyah. When all was quiet and we would
be dozing off to sleep, half a dozen would drop
lightlv on to the roof, and, after purring defiance
at us for awhile, would slide down the sides for
mere devilment, it seemed, and then race full
( Continued on next vage.)


ZAM-BUK heals
all superficial injuries-
CLEAN cuts that smart and sting 1 , ragged
tears that get inflamed, or punctured
wounds that weaken a whole limb, are all
common in the every-day life of home and work-
shop. The housewife’s table-knife slips while
she is cutting bread ; the husband has a similar
mishap with saw or machine, and the young
hopeful, who will “play with edged tools,” gets
the inevitable cut to-day or to-morrow.
The family pot of Zam-Buk should always
be on a handy shelf, where even the child-
ren can get at it if mother isn’t around
to bind up the bleeding finger or scarred
knee. Clean lint will also prove useful.
Zam-Buk is very soothing, and prevents tenderness
and inflammation by keeping the wound free from
poison and germs. Then it helps the severed
tissues to knit together by
taking actual part in Nature’s
work of growing new skin,
and thus the healing of
Zam-Buk is literally perfect.
Zam-Buk is a re-
liable healing; balm,
well known for its
great cures, and is
invaluable -for ec-
zema, spreading
skin disease, erup-
tions; sores, ring-
worm, ulcers, blood-
poison, festering
sores, old wounds,
bad legs, diseased
ankles, sore feet,
piles (blind, bleed-
ing; and itching),
chapped hands,
cold sores, wind-
chafed skins, itch,
cuts, burns, bruises,
scalds, etc.
FESTERING CUTS HEALED.
“I am licensed under the
Water and Sew'erage Board
as a drainer,” says Mr.
Hughes, of Alma Avenue,
Marrickville, Sydney, “and
am constantly cutting my
hands, which fester and in-
flame. I find that Zam-Buk
quickly allays inflammation,
draw's out the festering and
heals the sores.”
A MOTHER’S PRAISE.
Mrs. G. Poynter, of 68
Richmond St., Petone, Wel-
lington, N.Z., writes “For
cuts, burns, bruises, sores,
tender skin, chafed hands,
etc., I know of nothing to
equal Zam-Buk, and no
household should be with-
out a pot. I have no hesi-
tation in advising mothers
of families, and others, to
always keep it on hand.”

speed to the top again. Presently Long Bill
would steal out with a pair of boots in each hand,
and as these clattered on the roof, and ’possums
leaped right and left, and hurried for the nearest
trees, the neighboring hills would echo his bois-
terous laughter. I lost a good pair of boots that
way. Bill threw them right over the humpy
in his excitement, and they disappeared in the
lagoon.
Besides’possums, the hunter in his night ram-
bles encounters the flying squirrel, tiger cat,
native cat, koala, brush-tailed pouch mouse, and
several smaller animals. The dasyure and brush-
tailed mouse (Phascologale penicillata), commonly
known as the bushy-tailed rat, are hard to sight,
being small, and they both crouch flat on a limb.
Very often only the tail of the latter is visible.
.They are despised by bushmen, and would be
little shot but for the raids they make on the fowl
roosts. The spotted cuscus of Northern Queens-
land is better game. Though larger than a
possum, it is not as easily sighted, being almost
earless. It has a long, prehensile tail, the latter
half of which is hairless, and is altogether a
peculiar-looking animal.
Some of the flying squirrels are pretty little
creatures, particularly those of Queensland, but
most of them are hard to shoot. As often as not
the squirrel will greet the discharge of your gun
with its characteristic squeal, and, spreading its
parachute, float majestically away to another tree.
It can go only a short distance through the air,
and its flight is always downwards. It alights
low down on the tree trunk, and climbs up. . I
have seen many a one followed and caught by
dogs before it could climb out of reach ; but where
the trees are not too widely separated the dog has
no chance. Shooters, who mostly pass it by, can
distinguish it at night from the ’possum by its
much longer tail.
Ihe koala is encased in a tough skin that fre-
quently defies ordinary shot. One of the most
pathetic scenes I ever witnessed was the, shooting
of a koala one afternoon on the Richmond River.
Unlike the other animals mentioned above, the
koala does not usually seek the seclusion of a
hollow by day, but sleeps on a limb, or squatted
in the fork of a tree. The female, with its young
one perched on its back, thus forms a conspicuous
object. The old buck I have found wandering
about on the ground. A light kick on the rump
would provoke a murderous look and a grunt
from him, but he wouldn’t hurryif you tor-
mented him he would partly sit up, striking a de-
fensive attitude, with one hand out.
The one referred to was perched on a bare limb
of a big red gum, and seven shots were fired at it
without shifting it from its position. Beyond
slightly flinching and emitting an occasional
snort, it took little heed of the first four shots,
but at each subsequent discharge it raised its arm
slowly, crying piteously, and pawed at the.air. It
seemed to me that the poor brute was dumbly en-
treating its persecutor to cease, as a wounded man
might motion with his hand. Even the callous
heart of its would-be slayer was touched at last,
and he desisted.
Even when killed, the koala frequently cheats
its slayer by hanging with its powerful claws to a
limb. It is tardy in its'movements, and when it
tries to make haste underpressure, the result is
mirth-provoking. Its face has been described as
expressionless, butits very solemnity is humorous.
It shows at times a placid indifference toman;
but it will defend itself fiercely with teeth and
claws. It makes a tremendous row when fight-
.ing; and when the combat commences in the tree
tops it mostly ends in a thumping fall to the
ground. With a parting snort or two, and the
little eyes blinking savagely, it climbs slowlv and
tediously back into the tree.
The koala always descends backwards, while
’possums and dasyures descend head first. The
tailless one is often the sport of kingfishers and
peewits, and one hears the strong teeth strike
hard together as the old booraby makes an occa-
sional snap at his tormentors. He has the cham-
pion strong jaw. of Australia. Dogs treat him
with respect, and he treats Muck-i, the gohanna,
with contempt.
Most ’possums are fair swimmers, and spring
readily into water when pursued ; that is, of
course, if a tree is not handy. I have never yet
seen a koala in water, except a dead one, though
I once saw one floating down the Orara on a log,
and, judging by the keen interest it showed in
overhanging trees, it did not appreciate its
position.
Like the ’possum, it was once very nun? n>us on
the eastern rivers. Its donkey-like often
greeted us at the hut on Myrtle Cree ,:, and we
saw many a solemn face looking down at us while
ringbarking. The koala’s countenance would
add extra depression to a funeral.

In the North-West.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALL day long the coach, with its three
leaders abreast and its two polers, has
been toiling through the dreary depress-
ing landscape., The horses sink to, the fetlocks
in reddish sand. The coach wheels skid and
crunch and tear their way through. A dead solii
drag all the time. The long-haired, ill-bred
brutes strain and tug with drooping heads.
Where the traces rub along their sides there is a
white lather of foaming sweat. On their backs
are the marks of the whip. An aureole of sandy
dust encircles the lumbering vehicle.
There is not a cloud anywhere in the sky. A
savage and pitiless sun hangs low over the tops
of the trees. It shimmers along the vistas of the
sandy track and darts down through the shadeless
branches till the eye hungers for the green of cool
grass or for the sweep of refreshing waters.
Not a drop of moisture anywhere. Barren
gullies, with swaying cattle-tracks winding along
their beds. Milesuponmilesofstunted ti-tree, with
dry, dirty, yellow-papery stems and hard, arti-
ficial-looking waxy leaves ; sapless, stunted, she-
oaks; grass-tree flats; a coarse, wiry herbage,
sallow green.
No life except a hawk floating high up in the
sky, a flock of panting crows resting from the
intense heat, or an iguana darting for shelter be-
hind the trunk of a neighboring tree.
The only vestige of civilisation is an empty
beer bottle here and there beside the track, or a
discarded cigarette packet.
There is very little to distinguish one part of
the journey from another. An interminable
sameness, a dreadful hostile intolerant environ-
ment, in which the brute life in front of the
coach, and the tvyo belated human beings inside,
are an impertinence.
The coach-driver conforms to the general
character of the landscape—a dry, stunted, wiry,
wizened man, with small, peering eyes, that
range always from the ears of the leaders to the
farthest limits of the radiating perspective ahead.
In silence he drives, with his foot on the brake,
and his back arched. At times he says “Git-
turp,” mechanically.
No wind—only now and again puffs of hot air
dri ye vaguely past. No sound save the shrill
whistling of locusts and the crunching of the
wheels.
Late in the afternoon, a turn in the road brings
into view in the distance a galvanised iron roof,
looming up beside the ribbon of dust. It is the
Half-Way House. The passenger wakens from
his torpor; the coachman straightens his back a
little; the worn-out horses lift their heads and
quicken their pace of their own accord.
A low, rough building, of galvanised iron.
On the verandah, two chairs, with sacks for can-
vas ; a rough, bush stretcher, with a drunken man
lying prone upon it; some harness and pack
saddles. Close by, a stockyard with a windlass
and long poles for lifting slaughtered beasts.
Over in the paddock at the edge of the clearing a
pile of white bones. On the neighboring trees a
nock of crows. All around the house, goats—billy
and otherwise.
Ihe landlord, when he sees the coach coming,
gets in behind the bar and begins wiping the
glasses. Some black bottles are on the shelves,
and some of a light color. The black bottles
are low and squat in stature, and contain
dubious whisky. The lighter bottles envelop
“lemon squash.” Whisky and “squash ” are the
only two drinks sold.
The bedrooms have earthen floors, with bare
galvanised iron walls that reek heat. There
are antimacassars in the sitting-room ; a lump of
coral and some shells on a shelf in the corner; on
the walls, crude olios, picturing impossible horses
leaping improbable fences, in pursuit of prepos-
terous foxes.
No bath. Water is scarce. There has been no
rain for eight months. The nearest pool is four
miles away.
A teamster and his offsider sit out on the edge
of the verandah, staring at the desolation absent-
mindedly, vacantly and in silence. The dry rot
of the wilderness is in their blood. Their eyes
have the dull, hopeless look of men doomed to the
leaden fate of pushing dull, dispirited brutes
through the everlasting monotony. “ You didn’t
happen to see a bay horse, with a bell on him,
making back along the road ? ” Nothing more.
Every now and again the landlord comes out on
the verandah, from force of habit, looks up and
down the road, then goes back again and begins
industriously wiping the glasses.
The coachman sets free his dejected beasts, and
takes his place on the verandah edge in silence.
The man on the stretcher sleeps the sleep of the
drugged.
The brazen, defiant sun sinks down and digs its
own grave somewhere in the interminable soli-
tude, and the tortured earth, grateful for a little
respite, lies pallid and exhausted. The stars come
out in the steely sky.
“ Tea’s ready,” says the heart-broken-looking
woman with the weary eyes. The landlord sits at
the head of the table with his Crimean shir.t open
at the neck. He has a brown, hairy chest. His
moleskin trousers are earth-stained. He wears
blucher boots—no laces—no socks. “Mutton or
salt beef ? ” he says, with his eye on the passenger.
The “ mutton ” is goat.
After tea, the edge of the verandah again, and
the stolid, silent stare out into the darkening
immensity.
Out of the inferno, at dusk, a figure emerges—
a swagman with threadbare blankets and patched
boots. The white dust of the long road lies
heavily upon him. All day, and for many days,
he has wrestled with the desolation out there.
He swings his swag down on the verandah
wearily, takes his seat at the table, and eats
ravenously. Afterwards, he comes outside and
sits and stares into vacancy with tired eyes.
The landlord goes into the bar and begins
wiping the glasses. It seems an incurable habit.
A deadly stillness lies everywhere, broken only
at times by the despairing cries of distant curlews,
or the moaning of prowling dingoes. The kindly
night lies heavily on the intolerable desolation.
The dreadful, meaningless wilderness, that God
created for some inscrutable purpose, looms hos-
tile even in its sleep.

The Cyclone.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OUR house was always nice and neat—
The tidiest in all our street —
At least, until the other day
A cyclone came—and came to stay—
It turned us topsy-turvy
And left me rather nervy.
* And though our peace with noise is rent,
My wife seems perfectly content;
She likes the cyclone’s visit
(I’ve even seen her kiss it!)
When I come home I note with gloom
A sock or two in every room ;
And en. although the case is rare,
jSS an empty chair,
y-pin I hit on.
; not safe to sit on !)
And on ti c floor I always find
The serviettes they sed to bind
(I think it is) his tummy.
(You’d better ask his mummy !)
Our dinner used to be each night
An undisturbed and cosy rite ;
But now we dine and take our tea
To an orchestral symphony :
As long as he is able
He likes to whack the table.
When he obliges with a tune
His baton is a tablespoon.
(He says by joyful hiccups
He gets most sound from tea-cups.)
He’s really very fond of toys,
But only those that make a noise.
I took his drum away last week,
And gave a doll that could not speak ;
But still he makes a clamor :
(He thinks it is a hammer.)
The only things he really cares
To pull are my remaining hairs :
(I know why men who’re wedded
Get suddenly bald-headed !)'
In my spare hours—and they are few—
I used to write a verse or two;
But he my inspiration kills
When over him the ink he spills;
Although you mightn’t think it,
He rather likes to drink it.
When I was thinking out a rime
(You want to watch ’em all the time,
You never really know ’em),
He ate my latest poem ! !
