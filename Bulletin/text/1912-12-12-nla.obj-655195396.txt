CAUTION. —The large sale for
“Eumenthol JUJUBES” has led to a
number of imitations being manufac-
tured under the name of menthol and
other jujubes. It is important, there-
fore, when buying to be sure and get
HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes. You
may be asked to buy other jujubes,
and be told they are “just as good” as
Hudson’s Eumenthol Jujubes. This
proves that these imitations and sub-
stitutes have no reputation of their
own, and can only be sold on the good
repute and high character of Hud-
son’s Eumenthol Jujubes.

Adam Lindsay Gordon
There are poets and horse-poets. Adam
Lindsay 'Gordon, despite the halo that the
years have woven about his unheeding head,
belongs to the four-legged school. Practi-
cally he founded that school, and he re-
mains yet the most equine, if not the most
poetical, of the four-hoofed sub-species of
bards. There is no reason why a bloke
should not write verses about the moke. If
a poet likes, he can indite his poems exclu-
sively to dogs, or laud the high combative
qualities of goats, or depend solely for his
inspiration on wombats or bull-ants. But
his poetry is not necessarily improved by
this specialisation; and any such limitation
of his subject is surely a limitation of his
genius. For even at his worst a bloke is
better worth writing about than a moke, and
while there is a whole world of blokedom
from which to draw inspiration, a poet who
confines himself to mokedom admits that he
is not capable of writing about higher sub-
jects. This is doubly unfortunate, for the
number of blokes who like reading about
mokes is but a small minority of humanity,
and the number of mokes who can read is
limited to a few performing ponies—and it is
doubtful whether these really appreciate
poetry.
And the horse-poet is already rapidly be-
coming out of date, for the horse is dis-
appearing so swiftly that now in London he
is hardly to be seen. Except for the valu-
able purpose of cavalry mounts, and the
lessening use that the small farmer finds
for him, the horse is reserved for the archaic
purposes of polo-playing, royal pageants and
Light-Hours Day processions. In these
days a poet who devoted himself solely to
motor-cars or aeroplanes would occupy the
position that was once held by Adam Lindsay
Gordon.
j*
Gordon is already an Australian classic—
that is to say. he. like) Sbakspeare,, is to be
found in every home—with the leaves uncut.
He is taken, for granted, like the Bible; he
is sometimes recited and seldom read. Ex-
cept for a few things like “How We Beat the
Favorite,” Gordon is quite unknown to the
Australian public. Now that the copyright
of his book has expired, several new editions
of his work are .being published, of which
the first—and, let u's hope, the worst—is
edited by that industrious parasite upon
Australian literature, Douglas Sladen. This,
therefore, seems a good time to re-estimate
the claims of this horse-poet to Australia’s
consideration. With the poet’s life we have
nothing to do. Upon his poems he must be
judged, and, if possible, acquitted. But it
must be premised that this poet, born in the
Azores, and educated in England, shows all
through his work influences that were not
Australian, and writes from the not very
noble standpoint of the English huntsman.
His muse is a retrospective muse; he was
always a stranger in a strange land, an exile
brooding on memories of his old home. His
education he brought with him, and his
philosophy owed nothing to his new environ-
ment. He saw Australia as a melancholy
continent, because he saw it through the
dark-tinted spectacles of his pessimism. Per-
haps it is impossible for an alien to find
beauty in a strange environment. The first
attempts by alien artists to depict the cha-
racteristic foliage of Australia succeeded
only in giving imitations of the fat English
trees that they had all their previous life
been drawing. It was quite late in our his-
tory before an artist discovered the eucalyp-
tus, and, later still, before our poets discov-
ered that it was beautiful. And Gordon, as
a fact, hardly saw Australia at all. Cer-
tainly, except for a few casual references, he
did not put the rbal Australia into his
verses. Australia was to him but the vague
canvas upon which his memory painted vivid
pictures of his beloved England. As a
recent critic has pointed out, he hears whis-
perings in wattle-boughs, but they are the
whisperings of old friends and buried loves
in a far-off land. And even his most famous
poem does not describe an Australian horse-
race. ,It is “A Lay of the Loamshire Hunt
Cup,” and it has a “squire” in the first line.
Gordon was no new voice in poetry. The
accident which brought him to Australia —
an accident that has had an important, and
temporally a vital, influence on the develop-
ment of Australian verse, from which only
the poetry of the last decade has succeeded
in shaking itself free —has given him-a fac-
titious value. He was essentially derivative
—no Whitman; he bettered the teaching, it
is true, of the Whyte-Melville horse-school,
but he did not better the masters, Swin-
burne and Browning, that he consciously
or unconsciously imitated.
It is upon his four-hoofed poems that
Gordon’s fame rests in Australasia: outside
Australasia he occupies small place in the
history of literature. These are usually-
spirited, though frequently rambling, bal-
lads, of the George R. Sims quality, with
little thought in them, save the neat ex-
pression of some commonplace apothegm:—
So the coward will dare on the gallant horse
What he never would dare alone,
Because he exults in a borrowed force,
And a hardihood not his 0wn ....
Life is mostly froth and bubble,
Two things stand like stone,
Kindness in another's trouble,
Courage in your 0wn...,
And the song that the poet fashions,
And the love-bird's musical strain.
Are tumbles of animal passions,
Refined by animal pain ....
n , earth there's little worth a sigh.
And nothing worth a tear. ...
And his fatal facility leads too often to a
laxity of expression ; his quest for the new
rime frequently achieves bathos. He is cap-
able, too, of rimes like: Ghastly— mast lie,
roam, in — gloaming, siveet sure—teacher, sea
sure pleasure, finger — singer, archangel—
strangle, Aristophanes—off her knees. In-
deed, Gordon was ever the slave of his rime.
His metre, too, is commonplace, and in his
Ashtaroth” sets the action to the tune
played by a train on the rails.
As Iraneis Adams long ago pointed out.
Gordon wrote only in regular and rimed
rhythms, and had no conception of the
subtle music of irregular rhythm or of the
noble pageant of blank verse. He is “terri-
bly lacking in variety,” and horribly repeats
himself. Agreement must also be made with
that critic’s assertions that Gordon had no
capacity for sustained effort, that all his
good poetry is “done with a rush.” None of
his poems has the artistic completeness that
makes a poem a whole: careless Gordon
could not lop of excrescences. And the music
lie made is drawn from two thin sources, his
worship of the four-hoofed animal and his
imported and rather vague philosophy of
pessimism, the latter lit, it is true, by a
fine, manly, courageous endurance. He is
too digressive, too fond of his rather cheap
moralising.
Before examining his horse-poems it may be
elucidative to indicate what Gordon thought
of his chosen muse, the moke. He has
poems, certainly, dealing with station life,
but they tell mostly of races; and for the
rest, the horse, to him, is not the patient
drudge of the farm, whose quiet endur-
ance has, perhaps, a certain heroism, nor
the wild stallion, a spirited subject for
verse, but the specialised beast that runs
races round a Course, It is true, he lauds
chiefly the steeplechase—but horse, for him,
is merely the racehorse.
Yet if once we efface the joys of the chase
Jtrom. the land, and out-root the Stud.
Good-bye to the Anglo-Saxon bace !
Fabewell to the Nobman blood !
There you see his pathetic belief in the
racehorse. The proposition that the stud is
necessary to the preservation of our alleged
Norman blood, and that the horse race is
the foundation of our race, cannot but evoke
a smile.
Yet if man, of all the Creator planned,
His noblest work is reckoned.
°f the works of His hand, by sea or by land,
Ihe horse may at least rank second.
Again a proposition open to argument.
The dog surely must take the second place
among the animals, though both horse
and dog, as creations, are far inferior in
brain to the ant. But Gordon lived and
died in his worship, of the racehorse; his
heaven would be an Elysian racecourse. This
attitude, sincerely enough held, vitiates his
whole work as a poet claiming a general
suffrage..
His most famous poem, “How We Beat
the Favorite,” was evidently written in a
day when every horse was ridden to win.
Nowadays the favorite is beaten before the
race starts, with the whispered instructions
from the owner. But the poem itself is
merely a ballad of a race, rather stir-
ringly written, but lacking verisimilitude by
the. patent necessity of the obvious rimes.
It is suitable for recitation—in a bar-room,
or for illustration to a clothing advertise-
ment during Cup week, but as poetry it is
quite negligible. Stanzas akin to this, mak-
ing use of horses’ names for the purposes of
his rime, Gordon has resource to through-
out his poems:—
“Keep back in the yellow! Come up on
Othello!
Hold hard on the chestnut! Turn round
on The Drag!
Keep back there on Spartan! Back you, sir,
in tartan!
So steady there, easy,” and down went the
flag.
JZ
The narrative poem holds an inferior place
in the poetic hierarchy; and' Gordon is at his
best in the narrative. His method is simply
to begin.at the beginning and end anywhere,
often tritely, with no exercise of selection.
And none of these horse poems succeed in
giving the impression of speed Browning
gave in “How We Brought the Good News.”
For Gordon tells, Browning suggests. Gor-
don rode, Browning saw. Yet there are here
and there fine passages of description:—
'Twas merry in the glowing morn, amid the
gleaming grass,
To wander as we've wandered many a mile,
And blow the cool tobacco cloud, and watch
the white wreaths nass,
Sitting loosely in the saddle all the while.
’Twas merry ’mid the blackwoods, when we
spied the station roofs,
To wheel the wild scrub cattle at the yard.
With a runnifig fire of stockwhips and a fiery
run of hoofs;
Oh! the hardest day teas never then too
hard !. „■.,
Woods to the east and wolds to the north
In the sundown sullenly bloomed;
Dead black on a curtain of crimson cloth
Large peaks to the westward loomed. ...
Though the hawk with wings extended
Loises overhead ,,
Motionless as though suspended
By a viewless thread ....
When the gnarled, knotted trunks Euca-
lyptian
Seem carved, like weird columns Egyptian,
With curious device —quaint inscription,
And hieroglyph strange.. ..
I would that with sleepy, soft embraces
The sea would fold me—would find me rest
In luminous shades of her secret places,
In depths where her marvels are manifest.
Apt expression, the vivid lightning-flash
of observation, these qualities Gordon un-
doubtedly had : without them he would have
no claim to be counted even a four-hoofed
poet. But, .in his own line, Ogilvie is
better; and in the wider realm of poetry he
must take a minor place beneath Lawson,
O'Dowd. McCrae—to name but three. Credit
must be given for Gordon’s unfavorable
environment; allowance will always be made
to Gordon as a pioneer in a difficult coun-
try; but he should have no honor for the
accident of time that has placed him at the
top of Australian poets, and, by the mere
accretion of tradition, contrives still to keep
him there.
J*
In his horse poems, “The Sick Stock-
rider” has a sympathetic appeal; “From the
Wreck” is merely the chronicle of a ride
through the bush ; “Wolf and Hound” a bit
of melodrama; “How We Beat the Favorite”
a recitation; “In Utrumque Paratus” a col-
lection of apothegms, expressed with de-
lightful humor; “Visions in the Smoke” mere
random racing recollections; “The Fields of
Coleraine” a rimed racing tip, now out of
date; “Credat Judmus Apella” a chronicle of
horses’ names; “Britomarte” a too-long
narrative in verse. Of his other verses, “The
Song of the Surf” and “The Swimmer” are
mere Swinburne imitations; “Whisperings
in Wattle-Boughs” negligible like the rest of
his autobiographical poems. His ballads are
also worth nothing, and his plays incredi-
bly dull, lit by no suggestion of poetry or
of drama.
For a few poems, such as “Laudamus,”
the unfinished poem beginning:—
All night I've, heard the marsh-frog’s croak,
“Gone,” “A Dedication,” “Doubtful Dreams,”
perhaps “Podus Okus,” despite its damna-
ble iteration of jingling rimes, “From Light-
ning and Tempest”—for verses such as these
he will be remembered. And his common-
place manly philosophy of courage and en-
durance gives to his work a claim to our
remembrance. Despite his many weaknesses
as an artist Gordon had an unforgettable
personality; and it is this strange, virile?
personality that, at this date, we still see
looking valiantly from his verse, endearing
his work to manly men, even though their
judgment of what constitutes poetry is
essentially, and perhaps necessarily, uncri-
tical. Yet even the critic can feel the
humanity behind these halting poems. That
is Gordon’s chief claim to our affection, and
perhaps that will give a faint immortality
to his work.
*
But these collected editions of Gordon’s
poems are the greatest injury to his fame.
Every poet writds too much; nearly every
poet publishes too much. And when a poet
dies the makers of collections gather all the
discarded scraps of his scribblings and give
them to the world. Gordon wrote carelessly,
wrote too much, wrote no single poem that
is perfect. In a judicious Selection he would
make an appeal that is dissipated by the
inclusion in these “complete” editions of
such puerile things as “Ashtaroth,” his auto-
biographical scribblings and his lesser horse-
poems.
But the final judgment on Gordon remains
that of Marcus Clarke: “The student
will find in them something very like the
beginnings of a national school of Aus-
tralian poetry” ; or of Gordon himself: —
Yet not as a seer of visions,
Nor yet as a dreamer of dreams,
I sent you these partial decisions
On hackneyed, impoverished themes;
But with song out of tune, sung to pass
time,
Flung heedless to friends or to foes,
Where the false notes that ring for the last
time
May blend with some real ones, who
knows ?
And:
They are rimes rudely strung, with intent
less
Of sound than of words.
The Australian National Anthem
As an exiled Australian—there are many
of us here not altogether of our own choos-
ing—I ask you that you will publish in full
the Australian National Anthem. I confess
I don’t know it. At school we sang ‘Hail
Australia’; but that’s not the Anthem. What
is it? Let us have it in the ‘Bully.’”
Thus one of several correspondents of late.
At schools now we believe “Advance Aus-
tralia Fair” is taught; “but that’s not the
Anthem”—to Australians, though on the few
occasions when there is a yearning tb pro-
duce an anthem for the delectation of for-
eign persons, the Australian bands burst in
nny u mUS * tllat lla * somehow go
attached to the tail of this doggerel. Th
a -A-ustralian National Anthem wa
written by “Den” (C. J. Dennis) in r
sponse to a demand from this L page for a
Australaise. Characteristically enough i
its complete form it is unprintable; but her
goes tor a YV owdlerised version :
Fell ns of Australier,
Blokes an’ coves an’ coots ,
Shift yer carcases,
Move yer, - boots.
Gird yer loins up,
Get yer - gun,
Set the enemy
An' watch the run.
Chorus:
Git a move on,
Have some sense.
Learn the art of
Self de- • -fence.
Have some brains be
Neath yer lids.
An sioing a sabre
Fer the missus an’ the kids.
Ghuclc supportin’ posts
An’ strikin’ lights,
Support a fam'ly an’
Strike fer yer rights.
W’en the bugle
Sounds “Ad- -vance ’’
Don’t be like a flock er sheep
In a trance.
Biff the —- foeman
Where it don’t agree.
Spifler cate him
To Eternity.
Fellers of Australier,
Cobbers, chaps an’ mates,
Hear the enermy
Kickin’ at the gates!
Blow the bugle,
Beat the drum,
XJpper-cut and out the cow
To Kingdom come!
Chorus: ,
Git a move on,
Have some • sense.
Learn the art of
Se lf-de - -fence!
It ought to be “up to” some of our com-
posers to set this anthem to a good march-
ing rhythm. We shall be glad to hand the
best settings received on to a music pub-
lisher, though we refuse to guarantee the
re- suits. ,
“A minor novelist,” writing in a recent
National Review, once again punctures the
hopes of the literary aspirant. For his
first novel he received £45, but had first to
pay an agent £5 ss. for keeping the MS. for
10 months and returning it. looking like a
doormat, with the statement that 12 firms
had refused it. The author then offered it
to six other firms before he got it accepted.
His opinion is that a literary agent is use-
less, unless an author is in such a strong
position that he can sell his work without
the help of anybody else. Then an agent
will get him better prices. The author em-
ployed three agents. The first charged him
five guineas, and failed to sell three books
which the author himself sold for £lOO. The
second charged him one guinea, and did no-
thing. The third charged nothing, and did
nothing. On two occasions the author had
novels accepted by a firm that had previouslv
rejected them. His summing up is: 13
years hard labor, 14 novels published, three
novels unpublished, and £646. Average
about £4O per volume, less cost of typing and
postage.. But these returns include serial
lights. ithout them his average is just
under £37 per book. “This,” he concludes
is why I am going to abandon novel-writing
and start driving a taxi-cab. It is less riskv
and more remunerative.” A plain tale and
obviously a truthful one. Yet his books sold
fairly well, and several were reissued in
cheaper form. But in several cases he had
parted with the copyright. Still, as he says,
it a publisher will buy only a copyright it
is useless attempting to sell him anything
else But no author should sell his' copv-
hini to n ° r e^er c^ass of firms ask

Our Greatest Need s Populations.
0 the new arrival possessed of thrift, grit, and persever-
ance, Queensland offers opportunities to acquire wealth
and fame second to no other country in the world. With
an area of territory aggregating 670,500 square miles, or, in
other words, 429,120,000 acres, and a population of only
626,900, she has room for millions of people in every walk
of industrial and commercial life, more particularly the agri-
culturist. The vastness of her resources, the
fertility of her soil, the singularly varied
character of the crops raised, the
regularity of her rainfall, the'
genial and invigorating nature
of her climate, and the un-
paralleled prosperity she
is at present enjoying
places- her ahead of all
the other States of the
Commonwealth of Aus-
tralia. Queensland
holds out a welcoming
hand to all new arri-
vals, and invites them
to settle within her bor-
ders and participate in the
good things which Nature
has so bountifully bestowed
upon her. To-day is the time
to make a home in this State,
when conditions are so favorable ;
work of all kinds is plentiful, wages
are the highest, and all sections of the com-
munity are happy and contented.
Our Most Valuable Asset s The Soil.
The conditions under which land may be taken up in
Queensland are the most liberal of any agricultural country in
the world. Despite the fertility of the scrub and river flats
land, and their close proximity to railway and shipping com-
munication in many instances, the State offers them to in-

tion under the various modes, all of which are admirably
adapted for the cultivation of all kinds of crops, and for the
successful carrying on of dairying and pastoral pursuits.
Agricultural farms may be taken up in areas aggregating
2560 acres, and the payments therefor extend over a period
of 20 years. The purchasing price ranges from 10s. per acre
upwards ; the annual rent is one-fortieth of the
purchasing price, and is credited as part
payment thereof. Grazing selections
may be obtained in blocks up
to 60,000 acres on lease for
14, 21, or 28 years, at an aver-
age rental of per acre.
There are great possibilities
for dairying in Queensland,
and at the present time mar-
vellous expansion is taking
place.

tion in regard to Rents,
Prices, etc., of Crown Rands
available for selection may be
obtained on personal or written
application to the OFPICER-IN-
CHARGE, RAND SETTREMENT IN-

so far as mileage of lines open for traffic is concerned, in the
Commonwealth. There are, to-day, 4317 miles of Govern-
ment Railways open for traffic, exclusive of 358 miles of line
owned by public bodies and private companies. The total
railway communication is, therefore, 4675 miles.
There are 1560 miles of railway under construc-
tion, and the building of a further 618 miles of
line has been approved of by Parliament.
The railways under construction include
two very extensive schemes —the Great
Western railway and the North Coast line.
The former involves the building of 1282
miles of line, and includes the linking
up of all existing Western lines.
When completed, through communica-
tion from Brisbane to Camooweal, on
the border of the Northern Territory
(a total distance of 1335 miles) will
be established. The Great North
Coast Railway will, when open for
traffic, give a continuous line from
Brisbane to Cairns, and the present
gaps, totalling 454 miles, will then
be -linked up. The total length of
this line will be 1040 miles.
The total cost of the lines under
construction, and approved, will
amount to about
The sum of about is
also being spent on the reorganisation of
traffic and accommodation scheme at Roma

A VICTORIAN CLOSER SETTLEMENT HOMESTEAD
The Closer Settlement Acts
of Victoria
Provide Long and Easy Terms
of Payment for
Farm Allotments up to £2500 in value.
Agricultural Laborers’ Allotments up
to £2OO in value.
Workmen’s Home Sites up to £lOO
in value.
FARMS and HOMES for the PEOPLE
UNDER the provisions of the Closer Settlement Acts the Victorian
Government has power to purchase privately-owned Estates in the
country districts for subdivision into Farm and Agricultural
Laborers’ Allotments, and near the cities and large centres of population
into Residence Sites for working men. No unsatisfactory ballot is held; the
applicants are called before a Local Land Board, and after a judicial hear-
ing, the Land is allotted to those who it is considered will make the best use
of it. The areas are not arbitrarily fixed at so many acres, but are based on
a maximum value, so that every applicant may be sure of getting an allot-
ment of a reasonable extent, whatever the class of land may be.
This Act also provides for assistance to Settlers in the form of advances
of money to enable them to carry out the improvement conditions. Resi-
dence on the allotments held by a lessee is compulsory, both before and after
the issue of the Crown grant.
The land is sold under Conditional Purchase Lease, extending over a
period of 31-J years; the payments are therefore low, being equal to only six
per cent, per annum on the value of the land, and are made in two half-
yearly instalments of three per cent. These payments, spread over the term
of the lease, repay the whole of the principal, and .also interest at the rate of
four and a half per cent, per annum.
ASSISTANCE TO SETTLERS.
Advances up to 60 per cent, of the value of the permanent improve-
ments effected by them may be granted to lessees, whether farmers, agricul-
tural laborers or workmen, to assist in the development and working of the
land. These advances are repayable over a period not exceeding 15 years,
and bear 5 per cent, interest.
IRRIGABLE FARMS.
Large areas have been acquired in the Irrigation Districts of the State,
and are made available for application, from time to time. These lands are
more or less improved, are of good quality, respond freely to cultivation,
and provide an immediate return for the capital and labor expended. The
allotments will be sold under Closer Settlement conditions.
PAYMENTS IN AD-
VANCE may be made
at any time, and a pro-
portionate amount of in-
terest saved thereby.
INTEREST IS
ONLY CHARGED on
the actual amount owing
from time to time.
EVERY INDUCE-
MENT IS HELD OUT
by the Government to
those who wish to become
settlers, and assistance by
experts of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture is
available in any branch of
agricultural industry.
For Particulars of Closer
Settlement Land available,

A VICTORIAN ORCHARD.
VICTORIA IS THE IRRIGATION STATE
VICTORIA
is the second smallest State in the Commonwealth,
but it is really the Granary of the Continent. No
country in the world offers better advantages to
wheat growers, dairy farmers, wool growers, cattle
raisers, orchardists, or for the raising of lambs for
export.
THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT
owns all the railways in the State. They spread
like a network over the whole of the country, and
comprise over one-fourth of the railways in Aus-
tralia.
MELBOURNE,
the capital of Victoria, with its population of
over 600,000 people, is the leading commercial,
manufacturing and distributing centre of the Com-
monwealth.
VICTORIA’S PRODUCTION

Thus the total per head is £34 12 0
VICTORIA
has resumed over 500,000 acres of valuable land for
settlement as farm and other allotments under the
Closer Settlement Acts.
VICTORIA
is the land of rapid growth and unlimited possibili-
ties. Good Soil, splendid climate, ample rainfall,
free education, light taxation, and general pros-
perity.
VICTORIA’S
climate is the most suited of any in Australia to
the constitution of the British race.
IN VICTORIA
all crops which may be grown in England flourish.
Fruits of all kinds attain perfection. In the
northern districts are to be found thousands of
acres of orange and lemon groves, and vineyards of
currants, raisins, sultana, wine and table grapes.
VICTORIA
has the most liberal land laws of the world.
Advances are made on easy terms to aid settlers
in the erection of the necessary improvements. It
grants cheap passages to settlers from abroad.
Generous railway concessions are granted. Govern-
ment experts assist home-seekers with advice free
of charge.
RAILWAY CONCESSIONS TO SETTLERS.
Bona-fide applicants may obtain a certificate
authorising the issue by the Railway Department
of Return Tickets, at half ordinary fares, to enable
them to inspect the available areas and to attend
Land Boards. Reduced rates are also allowed for
removal of a Settler with his family and belongings
to the Land he has been granted.
FREEHOLD FARMS BRANCH
OF THE LANDS DEPARTMENT.
A register of suitable private farms for sale is kept
in this Branch of the Lands Department. The
list is varied and embraces the whole of the State.
The areas are classified according to value and
utility, and intending Land Settlers may inspect
with confidence any of the properties submitted.

ONLY TWO WEEKS TO CHRISTMAS!
Two weeks to Christmas,
Two weeks to go,
To the happy holidays
Men and maidens know.
Waiting for the season,
Waiting for the day,
But doing now the shopping
That spins the time away.
Two Weeks to Christmas,
Two weeks to run,
Till the Christmas bells proclaim
Another year is done.
Out upon the harbor,
Down along the street.
Now they talk of Christmas Day,
Due on flying feet.
Two weeks to Christmas,
Two weeks to fly,
Till Christmas Day is on us
With all its revelry.
Think about your present,
Think about your dress,
Think about your Christmas fete
And its happiness.
Two weeks to Christmas,
Two weeks to cease,
Then the day is with us all
That means goodwill and peace.
Children now are counting
Suns that have to set,
Till the golden season
Men will ne’er forget.
Two weeks to Christmas,
Two weeks to mirth,
When the day of all days
Dawns upon the earth.
Hey, for Christmas leisure,
For industrious men;
Happiness and holiday
Wait upon them then.
Two weeks to Christmas.
Only two, I vow;
Two weeks will quickly pass,
Give your orders now.
YES, it’s only two weeks to Christmas. We are already very busy on Christmas orders, although we keep twelve cutters
constantly going. You should get your Christmas suit in hand at once, and you can rely on our guarantee to give you
the utmost satisfaction in finish, wear, quality and comfort. We have the most complete range of all kinds of summer-
time suitings, specialising in Australian, as instanced by the well-known Vicars’ “All Wool” Marrickville Tweeds.

HILL-CLIMBING
is only one Fine Feature of Dalgety Cars
In the Austrian Alpine Contest, the Press Car was a 38-h.p. DAIMLER (one of the Dalgety
Agencies), and the Special Correspondent writes, in the Autocar, as follows:
‘‘We had to cross the two steepest passes in the Alps, viz., Tauern and Katschberg. The Tauern is
nearly oOOOft. high, and the Katschberg well over 5000 ft., but it was the gradients rather than the altitude
that jve found to be the major obstacles.
. , Our. oS-h.p. DAIMLER made light of its task, and ascended with ease, but chiefly on the bottom speed,
mull • A ts . elf the severity of the ascent. Some 30 miles from the start, we struck the Loibl Pass,
ihe height is well under 5000 ft., but as an ascent it is as stiff a proposition as could be conceived. In the
nrst place, the gradients themselves are probably from one in five to one in six. My fellow-passengers,
indeed, averred that the rise was worse than that of the Ivatschberg. In the second place, hairpin bends
were numerous and all extremely rough, whilst, in the third, the road abounded in humps and gullies. The
climb was.extended over 5i kilometres, and of this distance the major portion was appallingly steep. After
TVXTT C i e rAT? ern and the Katschberg, however, we had no fears whatever for our SILENT
JPIJaI IGJbdL JL DAIJVxJLUjIv.
As regards steepness, however, thousrh the Loibl may not be in actual figures quite as high as our friend
the Katschberg— l cannot pledge myself that it is not—it is certainly not child’s play, and I should be sorry
to tackle it with any car in which I had not the completest confidence. This we fortunately possessed, and
were amply justified. The car sailed by in triumph, passing every other that was within measureable
distance, and we reached the summit without a falter. We turned to the descent with the certainty of
having something equally steep in the way of gradient, as the valley lay visibly below us at an enormous
depth. Ihe road Droved just as rough and badly graded as on the ascent, and both by reason of the
camveaux and the steepness of the valley, we went down against compression with one or two others, and
the lower gears engaged and the clutch in. The DAIMLER SILENT KNIGHT engine, by the way, confers
exceptional advantages m this respect.”

A CHRISTMAS SERMON.
This is the season of the year when the
Church takes stock of its progress and its
prospects, and decides that the millennium
the ultimate triumph of Christianity is
12 months nearer. It makes this remark
with annual regularity, but it doesn t make
it so convincingly as it once did. There is
even a suspicion that the sects —except per-
haps the crudest and least educated of them
have lost heart and become perfunctory. It
is suspected that the sacerdotal institution
has, to a great extent, mislaid its punch.
The crusading spirit is very dead these days.
The spirit of persecution —the idea which
filled a man with such frenzied belief in his
own church, that every other church ap-
peared to him as a crime—oniy lingers in
mental and spiritual backblocks like Belfast
or Bulgaria, and it is now more political
than spiritual. The Inquisition no longer
finds it worth while to be inquisitive. Ihe
voice crying in the wilderness has. become a
much less aggressive voice, crying in a much
smaller wilderness. People begin to realise
that the Christian faith really covers a very,
very small section of the world s history.
It has dawned on the human race that the
globe is much older than was commonly sup-
posed. Genesis, if it is to be regarded as the
Genesis of the Hebrew chronology, happened
yesterday morning, or thereabouts. The
beginning of our religion, in a manner of
speaking, took place yesterday evening, about
tea-time. This morning the community has
grown rather lax and weary, and is more
inclined to trust for its betterment to poli-
tics than to pious influences. It has even
come to regard the average cleric as some-
thing of a drag on the wheels of progress.
Nobody has any clear idea of the world’s
spiritual state about lunch-hour the week
before yesterday, which was the day
that was a million years before the
Biblical Genesis. And very few people have
any solid convictions about what the world s
spiritual outlook is likely to be at breakfast
next week, which is one million years or so
after this present Christmas.
w * * *
Nineteen centuries ago—the odd years
don’t signify—there was born into this
world a creed which took itself seriously.
At that time creeds which took themselves
seriously were rare. The Hebrews were in
deadly earnest over their gloomy dogmas,
and their sacrifices, and their Pharisees, and
their temple, and their squalid city of Jerusa-
lem. But the Roman looked on his elegant
polytheism as something of a jest; and the
light-hearted Greek regarded his polytheism
more as a matter of poetry than, anything
else. The Egyptian and the Parthian and
the miscellaneous barbarian had views and
catechisms which seemed to cause a lot of
annoyance in this world, and hold out very
little promise in any world to come, I here
were heavens, like Valhalla, for kings and
heroes —-noisy and drinky heavens, with
abundant beef and unlimited revelry. And
there was, here and there, a hell like
Niflheim for cowards. But there was a
great lack of any definite promise for the
plodder, the slave, the ordinary person, and
the man with the hoe. The grocer was un-
provided for, so was the cheesemonger. Yet
the plodder was the person most easily
reached, if a reformer cared to approach him,
by reason of his ignorance, his credulity, his
miserable lot here, his extra-special need
for a better lot somewhere else, and his
wonderful numerousness. In the Roman
Empire of 1900 years ago, or thereabouts,
the drudge was plainly the man to
appeal to if a great, new, widespread faith
was to be established. He had no prospects,
no clothes of his own, no friends outside his
own order, and no money in the savings
bank, and he wanted something badly. No-
body wanted it worse.
* * * *
The appeal was made in a lavish fashion.
The new faith, which was quite unlike any
previous faith within our knowledge, de-
clared that the first should be last and the
last first, so that for all the illimitable eter-
nities the slave who believed should be
greater than the Caesar who disbelieved —
greater even than the who believed.
It declared that the meek should inherit the
earth, and that was the first chance of in-
heriting anything that the meek had heard
about. The slave was poor, and the Gospel
offered him a habitation where wealth was
so abundant that even the streets were of gold.
He was ragged, and it promised him robes
of splendor. He was fettered, and of no
account, and it promised him freedom and
glory, and social consideration in a future
state. He was miserable, and it offered him
eternal happiness, including the blessed satis-
faction of revenge on his tyrants, for
Lazarus was to be in- heaven, while Dives,
who apparently supplied Lazarus with
broken victuals, and was guilty of nothing
worse than pride and casualness, was to be
in a place too horrible for description. And
if Dives was in an ordinary sort of hell,
the inference was that Nero would be naked
and ashamed and fried in a seventh hell,
while the most downtrodden of his servants,
decked in better clothes, and topped off with
a better crown than ever came in Nero s
way, would look down on him from the
battlements of a grander palace than all
Nero’s money could buy—always provided
that the servant believed. There was really
no reason why the multitudinous servant
shouldn’t believe. The new revelation was
the only thing worth believing, that had ever
happened to him. Even if it only repre-
sented, in his mind, the thousandth part of
a chance, it was worth grasping at with
both hands, very wisely the new doctrine
was put forward as a doctrine of peace (the
slave had to be at peace) ; of non-resistance
(the slave was crushed and unarmed and
hopeless and leaderless, and he couldn’t re-
sist) ; of humility before Caesar (the slave
couldn’t be otherwise than humble before
CAESAR, and before many smaller Caesars,
because his humble attitude was hereditary
and almost incurable). Also, the slave, who
represented the great majority of the
population of the empire wherein our
religion had its beginnings, was bid-
den to suffer patiently, if necessary, in
the hope of a great reward. That was cus-
tomary for him. It had been his lot to suffer
patiently, with no hope of reward whatso-
ever The new creed was a wonderful ex-
pression of sympathy for the oppressed, and
they were unused to sympathy. It was the
only anti-Property or pure Labor faith on
record—the only one which had the courage
to damn Dives for a less offence than being
a big shareholder in the Sydney Gas Go.,
or. James McGowen for owning house prop-
ei'ty—the only one which professed to regard
wealth as a curse, and rags as something m
the way of a passport to Paradise. And at
the same time it was a most politic appeal
to the one class which was so numerous that
it might serve as the foundation for a world-
wide Church, and so hopeless that it could
afford to sacrifice everything (having no-
thing) for the sake of the new Church.
Christianity stood, after a manner, for the
General Strike.
* * * *
Old Rome acquired a worried feeling, in
face of this unprecedented development. Its
ideas in these days were: (1) That every-
body should stick to the religion of his fore-
fathers; (2) that nobody should interfere
with anybody else’s religion; (3) that every
religion (unless its rites made a bad smell, or
otherwise became a public annoyance) was
the same as any other religion ; and (4) that
no religion mattered much. The Hebrew
was regarded as something of a nuisance,
because of his bigotry and intolerance; still,
he only turned up his nose afar oft at other
faiths, and didn’t seek to make converts, so
he was allowed to pass. But the new faith
was a disturbance and a revelation. it
broke up the peaceful, dilatory order of
things. It wasn’t content to travel along in
its own groove, but it denounced the old gods,
and the old altars, and the old temples, and
the old priests, with their easy jobs and
their pleasant salaries, and called them ut
terly accursed. It tore up peace by the
roots. It invented hell, which was quite
new, and even the consul, and the pro-consul,
and the quaestor, and the sedile, and the
praetor, and the tribune became uneasy when
they heard of the horrors ahead of them, and
heard of them from people whose faith was
so profound that they were ready to die in
defence of these horrors. The men of the
new revelation declined to be daunted by
martyrdom. It wasn’t much worse than
what many of them had been accustomed to
in the ordinary way of business, and they
explained that, at the worst, they might be
boiled for a few minutes, whereas Cassar
and his minions would be boiled for ever.
This glorious and reckless assurance couldn t
fail to make an impression on CAesar and
his minions, who had no concrete faith ot
their own to hold on to. In many cases the
new men refused to do military service,
which was bad for the fading empire. And
their explanation, that the empire didn t
matter, and the whole world didn’t matter,
because a new order of things was coming, in
which the emperor would be the least of the
elect —a mere hod-carrier among the hea-
venly mansions—was so confident that even
the Government staggered in its palace. An
idea which could make the sheep scoff at his
butchers couldn’t but strike the easy-going,
faithless, immoral, casual old community as
something beyond the ordinary.
So in the end the Roman Empire be-
came Christian, under conditions, and the
conditions spread far and wide, and
they remain to this day. It struck a
compromise. It bought the heads of the
Church with the people’s money, and made
terms for itself with heaven, and patched up
matters with hell. It was decided to drop
the doctrine of non-resistance, because, if
that doctrine was maintained, no State could
last. A Christian slave might be non-re-
sistant, but a Christian emperor couldn’t if
he wanted to keep his empire, and a non-
resistant general would be useless. The
idea about the meek inheriting the earth was
abandoned, and the same old lot kept the
earth. The supreme blessedness of poverty
and the proposition about the damnation of
Dives were set on one side, and it was con-
cluded that the sovereign and the noble and
the squire and the archbishop might keep
their wealth on easy conditions, and without
being damned. The embarrassing view that
the first should be last and the last first was
quietly obliterated, and the Church allowed
Cassar a good front seat in Elysium, pro-
vided that he was anything like a decent
sort of Gesar, and even if he wasn‘t a
decent sort of Caesar the Church strained
a point and gave him absolution at no very
high price. The slave was left where he
was, and the slave-owner was left where he
was. The new God of Peace was turned
into a God of Battles. The old Roman world
exchanged Jupiter for Christ, but other-
wise it went on in much the same old way—
robbing and oppressing; buying and selling
and flogging its fellow-Christian just as it
used to buy and sell and flog its fellow-
pagan ; and otherwise going the ancient
road. Any impression that the Bible was
the secret of political greatness was given up
of necessity, for the logic of events was
against it. The States that were sinking
in the latter days of Paganism went on sink-
ing through the early days of Christianity,
and found in the faith no revivifying politi-
cal influence. The idolator who was rising
in the political scale kept on rising even
though he remained an idolator. The new
ideas of heaven and hell were accepted be-
cause the people of that time couldn’t shake
them off. But the original path to heaven
—by poverty, humility and submission —
being hard and unattractive, a new path was
invented, by forms and religious obser-
vances, and the building of churches, and
the depositing of gauds on the tombs of
saints; and with these doings were com-
bined pride, wealth, monopoly, tyranny and
corruption, just as in Jupiter’s time. It
was the most wonderful compromise in all
known history, and the compromise is al-
most as old as Christianity itself.
* * * *
Since the early years of the so-called
Christian Church the struggle for liberty and
progress and enlightenment ha= been mostly
a struggle against the Church. Perhaps
the explanation is that there was never,
since Christianity became successful and
respectable, any Christian Church. A cer-
tain philanthropic materialism has fought
hard with the old clerical bigotry for the
improvement of mankind, and wherever, in
so-called Christendom, the clerical outfit has
been least successful, the improvement of
mankind has been most conspicuous. Whether
the kindly materialism which has done so
much in the way of improving the human
lot has drawn its secret inspiration from
the Gospel or not, it is impossible to tell.
Perhaps it happened without religious in-
spiration, just as did railways and steam-
boats and telephones; and was simply a de-
velopment of the age and a result of scientific
discovery. / The Church did a great deal in
the way of supplying tortures, superstitions
and persecutions : how far it is responsible
for efficient schools, colleges, hospitals and
asylums is a moot point. The effort to
take a bird’s-eye view of the progress of
Christianity on its 1900th (or thereabouts)
anniversary is a very large problem. It is
certain that there is no Christian com-
munity nowadays. It is equally certain that
there never was one, for, by the time the
business was completed and rounded off by
the conversion of the early-dhy monarch and
noble, and brigand, and condottiere, and
slave-owner, and official torturer, and usurer,
and witch-finder, and such-like folk, Chris-
tianity had become a jest. It isn’t certain
that there ever could have been a really
Christian community, for a nation which
believed in peace and forgiveness wouldn’t
have lasted long, and if the meek had in-
herited the earth, they wouldn’t (except bv
a miracle) have kept it for two days. Even
the arrogant find it hard enough to hold the
earth for two weeks, though they defend it
with an axe. So the religious aspect of the
world remains a conundrum. The old globe
stumbles along somehow in its orbit among
the stars. It improves in some respects—
mostly in scientific respects —and in other
ways its movements are uncertain. Its
locomotives grow stronger, and its
belief in a material hell grows weaker.
Its mines grow deeper and its faith
shallower. Its bishops become some-
thing of a jest, and its medical men
become more akin to gods. Possibly it is
drifting back, in a religious sense, to the
old, perfunctory latter days of the wor-
ship of Jupitek, and is waiting for a new
inspiration.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Tale from the Territory.
“G.D.M.”: Thought of humping Matilda
and emigrating, owing to the cost of living, the
growth of Wowserism and the influence of
the women’s vote. It w r as a toss up be-
tween going to the Cold Country and
settling in the Northern Territory, which
Sidney Kidman says is not known to the
paper blokes who write about it. Well I’ve
dug up some alarming facts about the
United Kingdom, which doesn’t look to be
nearly as good a place to live in as the Nor-
thern Territory. In the first place it is not
big enough. The N.T. is more than four
times as large, although the U.K. holds
14,000 times as many people. Then the death
rate of the U.K. is higher, being 15.1 per
1000 compared with 10.43. The British birth
rate and the marriage rate are both lower,
and there are over a million times more
paupers in the U.K. than in the N.T. Net
imports per head prove the N.T. to be richer
than the U.K., being £l6 as against
£l2 12s. 9d.; while as to exports the N.T.
simply runs rings round the U.K., its net
exports being £B3 per head as against
£9 9s. sd. The U.K. leads the world in ship-
ing entered and cleared, yet the N.T. shows
84 tons per head of population and the
U.K. only li tons per head. The revenue
and expenditure of Hisex Gilrutii’s sat-
rapy work out at £lOO a head, while the Cold
Country figure is £4. When you come to
consider the public debt of the two coun-
tries the N.T. leaves the U.K. out of sight
with £1126 of debt per head alongside £l6.
And in every other test the N.T. looks a
much more desirable place of residence.
They’ve got eight horses, 158 cattle and 17
sheep apiece, and the inhabitants of the
U.K. can only boast one horse for every 30
people, one cow or bullock for every seven,
and one sheep for every li persons in the
community. The climate of Darwin is in-
finitely superior to that of London, for
there is less rain, dust, mud, smoke, wind,
sleet, snow and ice. There are fewer
murders, burglaries, tram, train and
motor accidents, fewer policemen, parsons,
beggars, insurance canvassers,. sewing
machine agents, dukes, lords, knights and
politicians. Also, there’s more sunshine,
better food and more of it, no distilleries or
breweries to wreck the moral tone of the
people, and there are no expensive shops in
Darwin to waste money in, such as are to
be found in plenty in Bond and Regent
streets and Piccadilly. So I’ve decided to
go and open an art studio in Darwin for the
sale of fine art engravings, black and white
work, pastel drawings, water-colors and oil
portraits. My missus can do manicuring,
pedicuring and face enamelling; so we ought
to knock out a fair living if we can only
secure the patronage of Government House.
“Montere” : The merit or remaining a
Scotchman, or an Irishman, or merely an
Englishman, when you aren’t one, would
seem to be about on a par with that of the
splendid person in frock-coat and belltopper,
who should fiercely declare himself an an-
thropoid ape, or a missing link, or some-
thing, and climb a tree by the aid of an
imaginary tail in proof of his assertion, lo
remain the same, without progression, im-
provement or development does not look
like a matter for applause or congratula-
tion. All the same, there are, in
Australia and Maoriland, scores of
people who never saw the northern
Foglands, vet disclaim their own coun-
try for one that their fathers or grand-
fathers were particularly glad to get out of.
Maoriland furnishes a specially flagrant case
in the Waipu district, where a lot of people
(settled since 1854) still claim to be Scot-
tish highlanders, and refuse to speak any-
thing but Gaelic, or marry anybody who isn’t
equally bragful of descent from the folk who
put up the poor little half-hearted scrap for
Prince Charlie in 1745. The Waipu per-
sons didn’t even come from Scotland to
Maoriland, but, on their own admission, got
away from Nova Scotia to get warm. Pre-
viously they had left the barren home of
their forefathers because of tlm prevalence, of
hunger, rheumatism, frost-bite, Scottish
traditions and similar matters, and, finding
the top end of North America very little
better, they at last reached sunshine, food
and comparative comfort at Waipu. And
these caterans have, for 68 years, been show-
ing their gratitude to the only land that
gave them anything like a welcome, by reso-
lutely refusing to identify themselves with
it, and by claiming, to the strident .music
of barbaric bagpipes, that they are still the
same poor shivering wretches who once eked
out a miserable existence in the Scottish
mountains, oppressed by their braggart
chiefs and despised by their lowland coun-
trymen.
“Croson” : I pause to admire the splendid
presence of mind of a casual Melbourne
crowd. I happened along a suburban mam
street the other Saturday when it was
crowded. Into it, but not out of it, run
several steep side streets, and down one of
these a runaway bike bore a damsel at a
smart pace. She was, in fact, going so fast
that all she could do was to hold on, keep
the machine straight, and pray she might
bump into a fat man or something soft. The
crowd saw her coming, and, without any
noise or fuss, formed a tidy lane, along
which she flew, straight into the plate-glass
window of a furniture emporium. She didn’t
get quite through, so most of the spectators
stepped smartly inside and assisted her on
to a nice, clean, new, double-bed, exposed for
sale in the window. Then someone bought
her lollies, another brandy—neither of which
she seemed to want —while a third rang up
the ambulance and a fourth the fire brigade
(they always ring up the fire brigade when
anything happens in Melbourne). Presently
she arose, adiusted her hat and other ac-
coutrements, and, without thanking the shop-
keeper for the use of his couch, stepped out-
side to get her bike. Presence of mind had,
however, removed that, so she walked home.
Then the furniture man swept the glass off
the footpath and put up his shutters. Every-
thing seemed so correct and methodical that
it looked as though rehearsed. But I fancy
it was genuine.

“Snell”: To Bulletin readers—be not
too precipitate in gallantry. I was sitting
in a compartment of a Tait carriage on the
Port Melbourne line. Opposite me was a
florid, curly gentleman of 30, dressed ex-
tremely. He had blue eyes and a proud
mouth. Tait carriages are separated into
several sections accessible from within. We
were winging our way to Montague, when
a piercing feminine scream sounded from
the adjoining segment of our car. In-
stantly the hero opposite was on his feet,
his eyes flashing fire., his nostrils dilated like
those of the highly inflammable desert steed
mentioned by the bard. I followed his
rush. We found a lady in an advanced
stage of decomposition, sitting in a coiner.
Over her stood a burly ruffian. Anyhow,
the fellow was burly, and his ruffianism was
taken for granted. Without a word my
blonde hero strode forward smote him
heavily on the chin. “Take that, you cur!”
he said, said he. The burly one sank back
on his seat, his limbs rigid, his eyes almost
inverted. For a few moments he remained
so, then slowly his stunned perceptions em-
braced the situation. Meanwhile the female
in distress continued to scream. “Compose
yourself, lady,” said the - gallant Saxon.
“No one shall harm you now.” The lady
emitted a more poignant shriek, and her de-
liverer fell down, and hit the basement with
his frontal development. The ruffian had
responded in kind. Eric Brighteyes arose,
his nostrils fairly pulsating with pride and
defiance, and I took up a position of safety
while he and the Big Coward hurled each
other over the footlights, and banged and
kicked all the way to Montague. There
official interference ended the strife. And
after all, the lady only had a spider down
her back, and her fellow passenger was
trying to retrieve it.
Melbourne has established an office where
the consumptive may put his head in at a
sort of pigeon-hole, and breathe on the clerk,
and ask to be admitted to the State sana-
torium. And the clerk said it was over the
when, among the people who breathed
on him in the first three weeks, eight were
freshly-arrived immigrants.
“Fontaine”: Re the discussion on the
value of cold steel in warfare. T. Kamo-
zawa, a captain of the Jap. army, has just
had published a prize essay on scientific
modern stoush in the Officers’ Club
Magazine of Nippon. In the course of his
article he lays stress upon the point that
shells, bullets and other affairs thrown from
a distance are only to be regarded as a
means by which the attacker can get to close,
quarters. He shows that many important
arguments in the recent war with Russia
were concluded in this way, and considers
that it is absolutely necessary that officers
and men should be inspired with the prin-
ciple of the arme blanche, which principle
he affirms engenders confidence, bravery and
the other qualities covered by the term
morale. He says: “The spirit which
prompts one to engage in a hand-to-hand
fight with cold steel is the most potent fac-
tor of victory; possessing it, we carry out
our duties . on the battlefield calmly and
without agitation. Victory and defeat are
independent of the relative strengths of the
forces engaged—they depend solely on the
A LOVING COUPLE.
“ Where Jacky now , Mary?”
“ Oh , Mister Sergeant him very fond of Jacky;
him bin take him up tonga gaol again cut

possession or not of that fierce spirit of
attack which demands the destruction of the
enemy with cold steel.” And Senator Pearce
has decided that the Commonwealth doesn’t
need to understand the use of cutting im-
plements ! The decision must make a strong
appeal to the expert of Nippon who has
enough imagination to foresee the day, at
Daly Waters or Powell’s Creek, when the
ammunition runs short and the fate of a
continent and a white ideal turns upon the
respective merits of badly-aimed blue-metal
and well-handled bayonets.
Bull is driven to do many curious things
in order to bridge the financial chasm which
Freetrade makes in his affairs. The other
day, the cable told the pathetic story of
how a titled lady had sent her tenants her
photograph, and a sad letter. The letter
(not the photograph) explained that, owing
to the heavy death duties, she was forced to
let the estate she had just inherited from
her father. It is expensive to live in the
grand old home of Freetrade, and it is very
expensive to die. The tax-gatherer is only
allowed one bite at the corpse, but he makes
it a good one. A couple of weeks after the
death duty item, the submarine liar had an
affecting yarn about two English servants
who inherited £40,000 from a Maoriland re-
lative who had died at cheap rates in the
Protectionist country, and, therefore, had a
decent amount to leave. The devoted ser-
vitors, however, had declared their intention
of remaining in service—and possibly bol-
stering up a tax-haunted squire by lending
him the Maoriland inheritance at low in-
terest. Mary Ann going round the Grange
or Hall with a feather-duster in one hand
and a mortgage in the other is a joyous but
not impossible spectacle. And, to balance
the picture, the loan-rescued squire might
be imagined in his partially-busted library,
writing out a cheque for the Freetraders’
campaign against the accursed Tariff Re-
formers. The average Englishman has an
idea that Freetrade was invented by Provi-
dence ; so even the silent corpse has to help
to keep it going, and the corpse’s daughter
goes into cheap lodgings while the rented
estate slowly pays the price of its last
owner’s long rest.

“Chudah”: The American Hebrew’
newspaper, just to hand, attempts, with
some plausibility, to rope many remarkable
men into the Jewish fold. Disraeli had a
weakness this way. Thackeray satirised it
in “Codlingsby,” winding up with “The
Pope is One of Us.” It is comparatively
easy to prove that every German is a
Jew. Shakspeare has been claimed.
Roosevelt is alleged to be Rosenfeld.
A Spanish writer, Del Olmet, claims that
Columbus was a Jew, and so the race is
credited with the whole ,hog of Chicago.
Del Olmet traces the navigator to a Jewish
family named Colon. He has found a docu-
ment dated about eight years before Colum-
bus’s birth. It relates to a debt due to two
undoubted Yids, named Domingo Colon and
Benjamin Fonteressa. Now the name of
Columbus’s father was Domenico, and his
mother was Susanna Fonteressa. There-
fore the Domingo was the father, the Fon-
teressa was the mother’s brother. Hyland
C. Kirk follows up Del Olmet with an elab-
orate pamphlet on “The Secret of Colum-
bus,” published in Washington. There are
four statues of Columbus in different local-
ities near Genoa, each claiming to be his
birthplace. In Spain he signed “Cristoval
Colon.” Undoubtedly a Spanish Jewish
name. It is also claimed that the face of
Columbus was Jewish. Coming to more
modern personages, the enthusiasts of course
find there can be no question about “Gen-
eral” Booth being a Jew. Further alleged
that Napoleon 111. was a Jew, illegitimate
son of Admiral Verlmele, who belonged to
that stock. Three Popes, Calixtus 111.,
Alexander VI. and Paul V., are alleged to
have been Jews.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The charge against Andrew Fisher, the apostle of
Labor and high wages and short hours and White
Australia, is that under his rule, this/ country has
become, more than ever before, the employer of the
slave, the sweated workman, the low-wage workman,
the long-hour workman, the nigger, the Chinaman,
the non-unionist —in fact, the employer of everybody
who is repugnant to good Labor principles.

I SAW tall Capital with golden wings.
Marked £ s. d.,
I watched him gather up his traps and tilings,
And soaring free
Take flight across the vague imaginings
Of some wide sea.
I said: “The time has come to say my
prayers,
And seek for grace,
To some Chapzandeb angel on the stairs
Of Time and Space,
Lest haply there be lack of ferry fares
In this sad place.
“Lest haply there be such a drought of gold.
Silver and beer,
That every wight shall feel his heart grow
cold , '
With sudden fear,
As if young Gladness suddenly lost hold
Of old Joy’s ear.”
I could not see a thing to do but pray
With might and main.
That cash before it reached the Milky Way
Might turn again,
And drive adown some kindly stellar ray
Its aeroplane.
Then I observed that rushing swiftly in
Through our wide gate,
Imported rags came pouring like cheap sin
Early and late,
The while cold tariff-sinkers sought to win
A trick from Fate.
I saw that by the door where cash went out
Arrived these wares,
Work of the sweated nigger bold to flout
Our customs snares,
And all my soul was kicked by some large
Doubt
Down Reason’s stairs.
My mental forces rose again with speed,
I climbed once more,
Bent on the perpetration of some deed
To shut that door,
Or wake some strong official folk to heed
My fierce uproar.
And then I saw who held the thing ajar!
Despite his hat,
I recognised his person from afar,
Prone on the mat —
Tall Labor in the coat and pants that are
The badge of Fat.
Filled with the tariff vintage he had sunk
To make him gay,
Itierht in the middle pathway, very drunk,
His big form lay,
And none could close the door for that vast
trunk
Which blocked the way.

“Mallarapoonie”: Cape York, where
“McNorth” (ip 8/8/’l2) writes from, and which is
Australia’s most northern bit of land, and one of the
principal headlands of the continent, isn’t a very im-
posing uprising, insurrection or geological revolt.
A low, conical hill, clothed from the sea-marge to its
summit with dense, stunted scrub; with the green,
coral-grown waters of Torres Strait washing its base;
and connected with the mainland by an insignificant
line of sand-hummocks, it isn’t the sort of proud
headland that one would expect to be the Land’s End
of a continent. As a matter of fact, the extreme
North of Australia is a rather disappointing sort of
place. When I was a kid at school in Victoria I
lived within sight of the blue precipitances, and used
to take delight in imagining that the huge chain of

the peaks of sunken mountains. Alas! that dream
is more or less blown out; for there isn’t a more
dreary waste of low-lying sand-tracts and stunted
scrub than is to be found on that dagger-point which
is the north end of the map of Australia. From
Shelburne Bay northward to the Cape any hill higher
than the one Sydney’s crazy railway-station is built
on is something to telegraph home about. Between
ant-beds, and gnarled scrub, and cutting-grass, and
bad language, the Northern Peninsula is a region
calculated to give one the pip; likewise the hump;
to say nothing of the spike, and the nark, and the
blue horrors. Still, patches of it are fair grazing
areas for cattle; and Jardine, of Somerset, has effected
beef near the Cape for many years.

“Tiaki”: If the Maoriland gum-digging
argument is not quite worn to rags, permit me to
mention another method which the “dentist” (a
gum-digger once described himself as a dentist, and
the name sticks) employs in order to secure the
coveted “kapia.” Climbing in the kauri bush is a
method which has produced a lot of gum for the
varnish' makers and quite a number of corpses for
the undertaker. The monkey-men generally work in
pairs. One climbs and the other picks up the gum
as it is chipped off with a tomahawk. The ascent
is accomplished by the aid of one long rope (and,
occasionally, a shorter rope), a fishing-line and a
“bob,” which is usually made of wood, and is at-
tached to the end of the line after the fashion of a
“sinker.” The “bob,” whirled round and round,
is cast over the first limb, which is hardly ever less
than 30ft. from the ground, and brings the line
down on the other side of the limb. Then the
climbing-rope is tacked on and hauled over the
branch. The “monkey” thus has to climb a double
rope, the advantage being that his mate can haul the
rope down when he (the “monkey”) has reached the
branches. If the gum-chipper wishes to explore the
higher branches, he brings the shorter rope into
play, and mounts or lowers himself at will. It is
very dangerous work, and experts very often rub
shoulders with the old gent, who carries the out-of-
date reaping implement. They will work from tree
to tree without coming to the ground, and, in some
cases, even lunch under the same conditions which
were in vogue before the habit of walking upright
became fashionable. Some men will dare Providence
by dropping from one branch to another. When
they miss, or their feet slip ! Knew a forest
ranger who once found the body (not the legs) of a
“monkey” who had fallen 40ft. into a heap of
pukahu (forest peat). He was planted as firmly as
the national debt.

“Wal” : Do crocodiles climb hills'? Lately
I was seeking the elusive pennyweight ’way up the
Tiveri River, a tributary of the Lakekamu River
(Papua), and climbing down to the river, late one
evening, to make camp for the night, my carriers
suddenly dropped their loads and vanished into the
dense bush. I stood where I was, thinking they had
dropped across some of the wicked larima people
(ignorant people call them Kukukuku), and reached
for my .303 in case of accidents. There was great
excitement in amongst the vines and bamboos, and a
gun was fired. After which the boys commenced
their hunting song. It turned out that all the fuss
was over a specimen of Crocodilus porosis. The
leading boy had spotted it amongst the trees, and
had made chase, followed by his mates. Further
search was rewarded by the discovery, in a clump of
palms, of a nest containing about 80 eggs, which
were gobbled by my stipendiary ruffians just as soon
as the tents were rigged and fire built. To get to
where we found him, Mr. Porosis (or was it Mrs. ?)
had to climb up a hill with about as much slope as
the roof of a house, the distance to the water being
fully half a mile.
“Tiaki”: “Tamumu,” of Maoriland (B.
12/9/’l2) wants a little more information. He can-
not understand why the 21-carat herbage lies buried
underneath and the Brummagem stuff grows strong on
top. Well, here’s the solution of the mystery. In
the vicinity of Auckland is a heap of dirt, known to
Henare, the Maori, as Maunga Whau. Further north,
at Whangarei and other
places, are similar heaps;
also, there are numerous
holes from which warm
soda-water is for ever
sighing. Every two or
three eternities these
heaps of dirt have a real
blow out —sort of get on
the bust. They usually
distribute a few billions
of tons of hot pumice
over the adjacent scenery.
This, not being conducive
to the longevity of any re-
spectable forest, accounts
for “Tamumu’s” buried
timber. At Kamo, near
Whangarei, the landscape
is strewn with scoria
rocks,' and the Kamo lake
is seething with warm
soda springs. I swam
across it once, and I
know. After a liberal
baptism of hot pumice,
and while Maunga Whan
and Co. are sleeping off
the effects of their jam-
boree, the farmer’s curse
(manuka), mentioned by
“Tamumu,” brings its
family along and settles
bn the alleged soil. This
goes- on for a while (say,
two millions years or so),
and the accumulated hu-
mus gradually induces an-
other kauri forest to take
nn its residence. Then M.
AVhau and his friends
again start in to smash up
the furniture and commit
breaches of the peace. If
“Tamumu” is not too im-
patient, and if he returns
in (say) a gross of cen-
turies, he will probably
find plenty of timber for
his farm-yard fence. He-
nare Anthropophagi had many a rare banquet round
Maunga Whan before the white man christened it
Mount Eden., Maorilanders persuade themselves that
Whau signed the pledge some time before Moses re-
ceived the consolidated statutes at Sinai, but the
weather is very uncertain here, and I would advise
“Tamumu” to procure a strong brolly and a life
policy. Showers of hot pumice may be expected at
any odd moment.
“Wandi”: Wagga and thereabouts used
to he the home of the Murrumbidgee whalers. Some-
times they formed little communities, hut each with
his own camping- and fishing-ground. It was not
gentlemanly to jump any of the claims when the
nominal owner was absent, even though he were ab-
sent for months. It was the custom with many to
bury useful trifles and camp articles before going on
a circuit up and down the rivers, such things being
dug up again on the owner’s return Some cut their
names or initials on a tree, and here and there one
of a humorous turn of mind carved the name of his
estate, which might be Sundown Park or Bookookoo-
boorara. It was also unneighborly for one to fish the
holes in front of another’s camp, unless invited. One
with good fishing on his estate never lacked for com-
pany when he wanted it. Usually their love of
yarning brought three or four together. When thus
grouped they tied their lines to their legs, or to
horse bells dangling from stout stakes, and played
cards between “bites.” One old fellow, who was a
retired shearers’ cook, used to tie the end of his
line to his big toe, which protruded from a gap in
his boot. Of course, the inconsiderate .codfish would
bite just at an interesting stage of the game, and
there would be a sudden downing and scattering of
cards to pull it in. The excitement over, and the
line cast out again, the lucky one would return to
his place, with the remark, “What was trumps?” or
“Whose deal was it?” They seldom played for
stakes, unless it was “to see who would go and get
some bait.” But when one was well provided with
fish and another had none, the person who was hard-
up borrowed a cod from his opulent neighbor to
go on with. The “Nark” was an unfortunate who
was pretty well always in debt. He owed so much
fish up and down the rivers that he was just about
insolvent. He was a person who got very grumpy
if he did not win as many games at cards as the
other men. and he couldn’t hear to see others catch-
ing fish when he wasn’t getting a bite. Whilst the
lucky ones smiled and winked at one another in
secret enjoyment, he would gradually become sulkier
and more exasperated. Finally he would haul in his
lines and go away somewhere and fish by himself. In
the end he had to go altogether, surrendering his
estate —including a bark humpy in good repair —to
pay for the fish he owed.

Is a jewel, till you learn to do without it.
So I shake the dusty street
From my unresponsive feet, -
As I shake that callow fancy from my
bosom ;
And I launch my bark amain,
Just remarking once again
That the use of dust and fancy is to lose ’em.
I will dump my little pile
On a God-forgotten isle,
In a classic part I choose to call Ignotus,
Where, enough for me to know
That the orange blossoms blow
For my bridal with the lemon and the lotus.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE first that I noticed of it was on the
forenoon of the Wednesday (March
28). While sitting reading on the
balcony I seemed to feel all at once that a
state of stagnation had come over every-
thing, a stiffness and deadness of the kind
often noticed in the summer, but much in-
tensified. When I got up to stretch myself
and take a turn round the garden, a slight
dizziness became noticeable. I was not sure,
but something seemed wrong with terra
firma —something unstable and unusual, not
so much about me as about the surround-
ings. Of course it might be incipient in-
fluenza. But others in the house were sing-
ing out about the same thing. They came
and asked me if I had felt the “earthquake”!
They said that things inside had rattled.
Had I not noticed, too, a slight rumble?
Then a group out in the street attracted
our attention. A man was in the middle of
the road excitedly pointing to the sun. “It’s
been in the same spot for two hours!” he
said. They were all a bit shaky on their
pins the same as we were, and they put their
hands to their heads now and then.
I looked up at the sun and then at my
watch. It was 20 to 12, and as I really was
under the impression that it was more like
10 o’clock, the man’s statements certainly
did seem to tally with my own impressions.
The sun ought to be much higher. I went
up the road to see what I could find out
about it. I discovered that in walking I had
a tendency to go to the left —to fall or sag
away eastward. Everyone had a list
to the east. I ran right into the
arms of a young lady just outside
the gate. We had to hug each other
to keep from falling down. She was a
blooming creature, with cheeks of the peachy
sort, I remember; but I did not think any-
thing about that at the time, being nearly as
much annoyed as she was. Only nearly, for
she had probably been in difficulties all down
the street, and the novelty had worn off.
A man gave a passing grin at us as we ex-
tricated ourselves. He was also sagging
away to the left, but when he sagged away
too far he made a short run to the right, and
clutched the fence. The feeling to be over-
come was that there was something missing.
Some normal condition of the earth that we
were used to, and had always unconsciously
allowed for, seemed gone, or going. But the
feeling lost some of its effects as you got
used to it.
I met a person who was partially drunk,
and gathered from him that the earth had
run down, that it was the beginning of the
end, but that the trams were still running
and public credit was fairly good as yet.
He said that Baracchi, our Government
astronomer, knew all about it, and that there
were crowds round the news offices reading
the telegrams. By this time the streets were
getting lively; everybody was going town-
wards, and soon special editions were being
cried.
I bought one. It was substantially the
drunks’ yarn in big type, embracing a few
cables from different parts of the world, and
an explanation from Baracchi. It was no
earthquake. The earth was actually slow-
ing down! It had started to do so during
the previous night. It would stop altogether
at a quarter to four that afternoon (3.47
and some seconds, to be exact). Another
edition with fuller accounts and explana-
tions would come out at two o’clock.
I made all haste home again. It was
curious how everyone did the same, after get-
ting the news. There was little or no dis-
cussion. The thing was too astounding—
perhaps, notwithstanding all the show qf
evidence, too absurd for argument. People
just glanced more or less blankly at each
other, and then took themselves off to their
folks at home. I thought this very touching,
and tried to realise the situation as I went
along—that the old earth had run down,
that its spin was at an end. But I couldn’t
get within miles of it.
In an hour or two the news had generally
settled down everywhere, and in the remark-
able reaction that followed, all the people
were out of doors as if it were Mafeking
day. All the churches were open, but the
majority of the folk kept holiday, and the
pubs did a roaring trade.
Then came two o’clock with the anxiously-
waited-for papers again. All the astronomers
had known for some time that an extraor-
dinary movement was imminent, such as
had not taken place within history, and that
it might happen in March. “The Automatic
Correction of the Accumulated Magnetic
Errors in the Perihelion of Mars,” they
called it —or something like that.
As far as I have ever been able to under-
THE WOWSER.
stand the matter, Mars, owing to its irregu-
larities of motion, of which there are some
50, should have been nearly one-third further
on its orbit than it really was. It had
become the late train on the celestial rail-
way system, and had got out of step, so to
speak, and dropped out of the ranks. Things
had grown so bad that Mars was obstruct-
ing the heavenly traffic. Now, in the natural
course of things, conditions of momentum
and reaction had arrived that forced a
mechanical correction of this lagging pro-
cess. The unpunctual planet was going to
put on a spurt and run for its life. Speaking
colloquially, Mars would dash across part
of its orbit to save time. It would leave its
beaten track and take a short cut across a
paddock—the paddock in which old Earth
was grazing. The reaction following on the
extra solar force used for this momentum
was the reason for our temporary stoppage,
and by this stoppage of ours collision would
be just averted. Failing that, Mars would
have struck us on the outside, and the
banked track of the heavens would have seen
a fearsome smash. As there are no straight
lines in orbit, or anywhere in Nature, it
must not be supposed that this cutting of
the corner would be in an absolute straight
line, but it would be a curvilinear approxi-
mation to one.
The rarity and importance of the opera-
tion (which is a first-class one) may be
judged by the fact that it is calculated that
a similar occurrence cannot have taken place
during the last 4,600,000 years.
As before said, all the astronomers had
known of the impending movement for some
time. Mr. Baracchi had not thought it
worth while to mention the matter before.
It would serve no public end to be premature
on such maters, and hasty action might
play into the hands of alarmists and re-
ligious fanatics. Being asked by the re-
porters whether he would have made public
any intimation that the Judgment Day was
at hand if he had an inkling of such a
thing either from personal knowledge or by
cablegram, he said he might. It would all
depend. They had their transits to watch
and the tables of the moon to perfect. If
Judgment Day were a Thursday he would
probably have said nothing. The Observa-
tory was always busy on Thursday.
I and all the family were in Brook’s pad-
dock at the supreme moment. Half of
Toorak was there, waiting, watch in hand.
Everyone everywhere, all over the world I
expect, was out in the open somewhere, for
it was generally apprehended there might be
some sort of a jolt at the last, and not one
stone left upon another. But nothing of the
sort happened. The old globe slowed down
with marvellous graduation at the finish, yet
the actual moment of dead stoppage was
generally detected. In the very middle of
that 47th minute past three there was a cer-
tain feeling, such as no one living had ever
felt before, and for a moment or two there
was complete stillness.
We were to stop for 10 hours and then go
on again, and allowing for the time lost in
slowing down, the day would be 35 hours
old before we saw night—“if we ever saw
it,” said some. For religious stock began to go
up, and evangelists appeared at corners warn-
ing the multitude of the wrath to come, and
collections were being taken up. But for the
most part the assurances of the scientists
sufficed, and the time was given up to high
carnival and excursions to points of vantage
to behold the Coming of Mars! For it was
to approach us, in its progress, only about
120,000 miles off, and on the side of our
Southern Hemisphere! We were glad it
was passing on our side; we had the pull of
Britain this time! Everyone took a day off
except the post-office men—they couldn t
get away.
Mars came round the corner about five,
and once in sight rapidly enlarged. By six
o’clock it looked like a big balloon about
7000 ft. high, its markings plainly visible as
it whirled round. Two hours later the place
was quite shadowed by it. We had been
warned that, notwithstanding its real dis-
tance, it would seem so close as to produce
terror by its vastness, and by the appear-
ance that it was rushing straight at us; but
not a soul in the world could have been pre-
pared for the actuality. It was so close that
through a 3in. telescope it suggested views
of our own scenery taken from up in a bal-
loon. Canals! That question was settled
now for ever !—-beautiful canals, flowing with
milk and honey, and
habitations plain as
pikestaffs, with roofs
sloped like ours —the
Martians know that
water runs down hill!
The great Melbourne
reflector was turned
on to it, and took
those wonderful pho-
tographs in which you
can distinguish the
people plainly—
clothed, too. These
negatives were a
splendid achievement, as the
whole thing was swirling
round like a panorama, to
the eastward, all the time.
Some lost all faith in the
Observatory when only a
stone’s-throw of a few miles
as it were, seemed to separ-
ate the two worlds, and.
appalled by what appeared
inevitable collision, fell back
on what was left of their
theology. For them it was
the Scroll of the Apoca-
lypse, and they were to he
caught up in it.
The fowls also cackled
tremendously, thinking it
was a new kind of hawk.
At last, a united shout,
spontaneous and overwhelm-
ing, went up from a whole
hemisphere, as the over-
shadowing bulk was seen to
begin the “edging off” pro-
cess. It was a shout of
relief.
We loved those Martians
as we had never loved them
before, but we were genu-
inely glad, for their sakes
and ours, that they were
coming no closer. And the
shout was a greeting, too.
and a farewell, for we would
never meet again.
And some hours after, Mars being then
a hurried, receding blot in the distance, the
old Earth was felt to give its first, little,
almost imperceptible throb. The engine was
working again, and once more the sun began
to travel slowly west. But it was well on
in the next day before normal conditions re-
turned, and we knew she was going strong
once more.
The feeling of utter deadness and want of
interest in mundane matters did not set in
immediately, but, whem it did, it lasted, if
indeed we will ever get over it. We yearn
now for bigger things than international
compliments and political developments.
As Robertson says, the excitement of it
will tinge the centuries.
Its literature will have no end, and its
comedies are innumerable.
Some of these were local. Bent, of
course, was interviewed about it, and broke
out in his bluff way, and expressed his dis-
approval of the entire business. But he
said it was quite a mistake to say that
nothing of the kind ever hanpened before.
When he was a boy at Brighton it occurred
frequently.

Bill Sunset’s Great Discovery.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“T T E’S a sorter double-ended elephant
I I —that’s about the only way yer
can describe him.” Bill leant for-
ward in the leather armchair of the hotel
lounge and tapped me impressively on the
knee with his immense sunburned paw. “I
reckon he’s one of them Stone Age things;
there’s nothin’ like him in any of the animal
books, only the elephant; but he looks older
than the oldest elephant I ever seen. You
know that kind, sorrowful look an old ele-
phant has? Well, Mick —that’s what I call
him —Mick has just the same 100k —only
worse. Sometimes when I was bringin’ him
across in the old Zulu, I uster go down an’
talk to him about Pharaoh and Pontius
Pilate and all the old Bible crowd; and, by
Jingo, the old feller uster prick up his ears
and make noises inside him and cry —yes, he
uster cry till the blessed decks was wet and
the scuppers tricklin’. I’ll take me oath that
Mick was knockin’ round when all the old
crowd was on deck! I reckon the poor old
josser is full to the neck with history if you
could only dig it out of him. You know
yourself that an animal that’s been trampin’
round f’r thousands an’ thousands of years
is a bit more than four legs and a few tons
of meat. It’s just possible that one of these
’ere scientific blokes might get somethin’ out
of him. Supposin’ we got one of them Uni-
versity perfessors to come along and sling
him a bit of Greek, or get the boss of the
Synagogue to try him with a chunk of old
Hebrew? You know, Jack, English is too
new for Mick; it isn’t a fair deal to the
old boy to ask him to try and understand it.
Now a bit of Greek or Hebrew might just
hit him in a sentimental spot—make him
think of old times when he _ was a young
whatever-lie-is »nd had all his friends and
relations round him. That’s the way you
want to come at him —stir up his dusty old
memory and touch his few hundredweight of
heart with a junk of Egyptian or something
—the oldest brand of yabber we’ve got on
the premises.”
“But tell me this, Bill. Where did you
catch him, and what are you suing to do
with him now that you’ve got him safely to
Sydney?”
Bill spends four-fifths of his time amongst
jungle savages in the dark corners of the
earth, doing extraordinary, unheard-of things
and fighting for his life at least once a week.
If he talked much of the life he knows,
people would call him a liar; so he has got
out of the habit. He tells you things with
reluctance if he has no substantial evidence
—such as a mammoth, for instance —where-
with to crush you in the event of your dis-
believing him.
“In Papua,” he remarked briefly. ‘He
stepped out of the bush one night and picked
up a boy in each of his trunks. The others
Started to yell and throw things at him; but
I saw that the beggar was just curious, and
booted them round till they stopped worry-
ing him. Then I coaxed the beggar up to
my tent with lumps of sugar. He’s a gentle

old sausage—gentle as the oldest and kind-
est man you ever knew multiplied a. thou-
sand times and put inside a skin as big as a
church. He followed me like a dog to the
coast with the whole camp outfit roped on
his back, aDd he came aboard at Port
Moresby as easy as an old commercial going
aboard a liner. That’s how I got him. I
reckon to sell him to the Zoo when I’ve
finished studyin’ him.”


“Where is he stabled?”
“In an old hall out Gletown way. I took
him out there last night as soon as we tied
up to the wharf.”
“Aren’t you afraid of him breaking loose
or doing something rough?”
“No, I’m not! He’s the gentlest beast I
ever struck. He never breaks anything or
tries to get out of wherever you put him.
You could tie him up with a bit of cotton
and he wouldn’t break it. The only fault
he has is that he’s curious and very short-
sighted, and is always pickin’ things up with
his trunk or his tail and holdin’ them close
to his dim old eyes. But he never hurts
anything; and if he happens to spill or up-
set a few trifles out of your pocket, he picks
them or the bits up again and puts things
right as gentle as an old maid. Why, lie’s
picked me up scores of times, had a good
look at me, and put me down again without
as much as creasin’ me coat! I tell you
lie’s the most interestin’ old devil I ever
struck. When can you come out to see
him ?”
“Let’s go now,” I cried impulsively.
“Right you are!” answered Bill, draining
his glass. “Let’s find a cab though; I can't
stand the racket of these darned trams.”
A hansom was whistled for us, and within
20 minutes we were standing before the tern-
porary residence of the Great Discovery.
“Quiet as a lamb,” said Bill as he fumbled

Then 'he opened the door and showed me
Mick, the friend of Pharaoh and Pontius
Pilate. He was like a tuskless elephant,
only that he had two trunks instead of one,
and wore a sort of coarse red thatch on the
top of his back. He possessed a long tail
about as thick and twice as long as an
ordinary elephant’s trunk. With this he
could pick up anyone standing within 15ft.
behind him and pass him round to the front
for inspection. From what Bill told me, I
gathered that the tail was a sort of express
delivery company for the front department,
His ears were similar to an elephant’s, but
his eyes were much larger. His hind-legs
were longer than the forelegs, and when you
viewed him from the rear, he appeared to be
merely two hind-legs like twin cathedral
pillars and a tail like the largest sort of
hempen hawser. It gave him an exclusive
look from that direction. His mouth was,
for his size, absurdly small, and he ate only
at rare intervals when something dainty
tempted him. Apparently he had learnt the
art of keeping alive without stuffing himself
regularly three or four times* a day. That
interested me immensely, and I determined
to try and find out if possible how he man-
aged it.
“Hallo. Mick, old boy,” remarked Bill in
a friendly tone.
The big ears twitched slightly, and the
tail like the ship’s cable started to swing
happily to and fro.
“ He’s goin’ to pass me round to the front
entrance,” whispered Bill confidentially,
“You watch him!”
The big tail swung to and fro another
couple of times; then stretched swiftly out
like a wide-awake boa-constrictor, and
caught Bill round the waist as gently as a
dancing young man clasps a pretty girl
partner in a ballroom.
“Here we go!” cried Bill jubilantly as
the .Tail Transport Company lifted him off

his feet and swept him carefully round to
the front. It reminded me strongly of the
man with the whistle who travels round on
the blocks of stone when a big building is in
course of erection.
As soon as the tail delivered him at the
mammoth’s left eye, Bill patted him gently
on his roof-garden and murmured soothing
words. As he cooed, one of the disengaged
trunks came up. lifted off his liat and held
it in front of the other eye.
“See that!” cried Bill excitedly. “That
hat’s new—he’s never seen it before!”
Then the second disengaged trunk curled
up and went snuffing into his coat pocket.
It emerged with a penny bun, which it
waved once gracefully in the air, and then
passed without haste to the mouth under-
neath.
“Gentle as a cat!” remarked Bill from
mid-air, beaming and patting the roof-
garden approvingly. “Good old Mick! Yer
a credit to me !” The trunk with the hat,
at this stage v came back and replaced the
headgear firmly but sideways on Bill’s head.
Then the tail swept him gently back, and,
alter replacing him by my side, resumed its
normal position.
Hill took off his crumpled hat, smoothed
it, and put it on correctly. ' isn t lie a
beauty?” he demanded, flushed with pride.
"Isn’t he a homert”
"He seems, to be terribly short-sigh tea,
though, Bill.”
'Yes, he is, poor old beggar! He has to
put everything up to his eye before he can
see what it is. I suppose his eyesight is
the weak part of liis get-up, and is feelin’
the strain of old age. I’ll get an oculist to
have a look at lnm next week, and see if
anythin’ can be done for him.”
“Not spectacles!” I yelled,
Bill grinned sheepishly. ‘‘No; not exactly
spectacles. I might be able to get some
lotion, though, and put it in with a garden
hose—that is, if it’s not too dear. By the
way, Jack, .I’m goin’ to gee them University

circus people are due to have a look at him.

Cn approaching Mick s residence, I ob-
served that Bill had put up a flagpole and
! a string of flags flying. Bill himself,
in a new £ re .y suit, was talking excitedly to
a group ot stout, important-looking men sev-
eral whom wore the top-hat and frock-
coa-t ,°f state, and appeared to be very ill at
oase in them. Ihe circusmen, the Rabbi, the
Dago and the University professors were all
in attendance, and we waited only the arn-
val .the Mayor. lieis comm in all his
war-paint, whispered Bill in a hoarse aside,
“Dne of the councillors just told me that he s
naw to the job, and puts on all the flummery
wherever he goes. A man like that oughter
stick feathers in his hair, and sharks
teeth in his whiskers, and get into the bush
amongst the niggers, where that sorter thing
goes down. Here he comes the old
rooster.”
The Mayor, in his hired brougham, came
rolling down the street, attended by a fur-
tive-looking man who might have been the
Town Clerk or the Rate Collector. The
councillors surged forward to greet him, and
help him to alight safely without tripping
over his official bath-robe, while the rest of
the little group looked on with contempt.
When Bill had received the great man, he
introduced us all in turn, then led the way
to the mammoth’s house and unlocked the
door. We straggled into the commodious,
earthen-floored building, and grouped our-
selves round Mick at a respectful distance.
Then Bill took the floor and save a concise
account of the capture of Mick, and ex-
plained his theory re the ancient language
test which lie proposed to try.
There was no necessity for the Mayor to
make a speech at all, but, the instant Bill
had concluded, he cleared his throat and
maundered ungrammatically about “this ’ere
beast,” until Bill cheerily cut him short with,
“ That’s all right, boss. We’re all friends
here, I reckon, and there’s no need to work
yourself into a sweat about it. Anyhow,
least said’s soonest mended, and it’s too
blanky hot to hold a corroboree to-day.
Thanks all ihe same!”
The fat Mayor reeled in his tracks and
tried to burst —at least, the way he kept
swallowing the atmosphere suggested that
(hat was his deadly object. However, he
didn’t succeed in accomplishing it. His
chain of office, or (he hath robe or something,
held him together, and he was intact when
Bill invited the Rabbi to try some Hebrew
on the sublimely placid Mick.
The Rabbi was a fragile, nervous man
with gold-rimmed glasses, and lie didn't like
to approach the mammoth too closely. He
just put his hands to his mouth where he
stood, and shouted something that sounded
like a phonograph record going backward at
full speed. The effect of it on Mick was re-
markable. First of all lie reared up on Its
hind legs and blew screams of joy through
both trunks alternately; then he spun round
three times, and finally came to earth again
with his back towards us, his big tail making
hungry swipes at the empty air, and his ears
flapping. . 0-11
”By hohey, that got him!” hissed Bill.
“Try some more, Mister!”
The Rabbi, who had faded into the far
corner of the edifice along with the rest of
the visitors at the commencement of Mick s
exercises, came forward once more, and,
after thinking for a moment, fired another
Hebraic broadside into the friend of P.
PllcltG.
This time Mick wasted no time in ecstatic
cavortings, but came at us at a run, deter-
mined to find out which animal of our crowd
was 2000 years old and willing to swap
reminiscences with him. We scattered
in all directions from the short-sighted
old beggar, and did our frenzied best
to avoid his blundering legs: but, _in
spite of all our running and dodging
and yelling, he bumped into some-
one every second or so, and in a flash the
tail or one of the trunks would be round the
bumped one, and hoisting him to one or other
of tiie big, flapping ears as a child lifts a
shell. When he found that his captive was
either .doing plain howling, or swearing in
modern English, he would put him rapidly
back on the ground and rush round until he
caught another. At one crowded period he
had three men going aloft at the same
instant. We might have been able to calm
him down, only the Mayor’s infernally
clumsy bed-gown kept tripping him up
and throwing him in Mick’s path again
and again, and every time Mick picked him
up and held him to his ear, the chain of office
tickled his roof-garden and made him mad.
The poor Rabbi,
who was a speedy
cleric and an excel-
lent dodger, kept
shouting old Hebrew
endearments as he
ran; but they merely
had the effect of goad-
ing Mick to frantic
efforts to find out
from which of us they
emanated. At last
Bill made a dash for
a wooden ladder that
ran up one wall, and
clambered up it to a
rough loft or plat-
form above the raf-
ters. One by one, as
opportunity offered, we jumped for the nar-
row way of escape and climbed madly to
the dusty grandstand, until only the Mayor
and one alderman were left in the arena.
The well-meaning but foolish Rabbi, from
our elevated roosting-place, continued to
shriek Hebrew to Mick; and Mick responded
by stoking up his ancient furnaces and going
after the remaining competitors at forced
draught. The exhausted Mayor was pres-
ently caught again, and the alderman seized
the chance to make his escape. He fell down
gasping beside us, just as Mick put down the
Mayor for the fifteenth time and chased off
after nothing.
An animal less short-sighted and excited
than he was might easily have made the
mistake of supposing the place to be as full
as ever, for we were all howling advice to
the Mayor, as barrackers howl it at foot-
ballers, although they know the players are
too infernally hard-pressed to even listen.
Our yelling was just as futile as barracking.
It kept Mick excited and did no earthly good
to the Mayor, whose situation now seemed to
be getting dangerous; for, being the only
one left in the game, he was being captured
every minute or so, and his dangling chain
of office kept Mick’s thatch in a continual
state of irritation. The diabolical frequency
or numerousness of the Mayor at last broke
down Mick’s extraordinary patience, and the
forty-fifth time he drew him-fin the sweep of
his tail he didn’t relinquish him as politely
as hi herto. Instead, he waddled to the
dustiest corner of the building, and, using
one trunk as a suction pipe, curved the other
one over his captive’s head like a street
hydrant, and hosed the wretched man with a
continuous stream of floor-dust and small
refuse, at a pressure that made the Univer-
sity professors gasp in wonder and admira-
tion.
“My Gord!” shouted Bill, “he’s worse than
a fire-ingin’! Stop it, Mick, you fool!”
Mick didn’t stop it. He kept right on for
a good three minutes, until the Mayor was
coal-black and half-smothered. Then he
put the dazed man down and scooted off
again in pursuit of the Rabbi’s Hebrew.
There was only one thing to catch, and
within a minute he had it again. As the
chain of office tickled his ear for the forty-
sixth time, he emitted a scream of rage.
This time the Mayor got a full five minutes
deluge of dust and rubbish. By the time
Mick was through with him, he looked fit for
one of his own tips. Immediately the tail
swung him aside and uncurled itself from his
waist, he staggered in’o a corner and col-
lapsed there in a heap, while Mick con-
tinued his mad course after the phantom
scraps of dead language.
Round and round went the poor old brute,
screaming and sobbing through his trunks
and reaping the whirlwind with his
convenient and obliging tail. Presently
he began to stagger and snort, and we rea-
lised that his strength was rapidly ebbing.
But he continued to struggle bravely on until
his cathedral pillar legs gave way under him.
Then he tumbled over on his side and lay
lil-o a capsized ship without a move.
Bill was first the ladder. He rushed
to Mick’s side, danced a brief gavotte of
grmf and uncertainty, then caught up the
end of the nearest trunk and, exerting all
his strength, put it to his ear as though it
were a telephone receiver.
“He’s breathing!” he cried joyfully. 1
can hear it! It sounds like the surf at
ALanly when there is a heavy sea running.”
But it didn’t last long. Poor old Mick was
breathing his last, and, in a little while, the
surf-sounds in his trunk ceased for ever.
Bill couldn’t believe that his pet was really
dead, and he continued to listen at the
trunk and to peer at Mick’s glazed left eye
until one of the circus men touched him on
the arm, and, in subdued, undertakerish
tones made him a really handsome offer for
the skin.
Then the grief of Bill burst forth in a
funeral oration that knocked the stuffing out
of Mark Antony’s few remarks over dead
Csesar, and made Hamlet’s Soliloquy seem a
mere comic song. He waved his arms and
said that Mick had been acquainted with
Pharaoh and Pontius Pilate, and had known
every stone of Jerusalem. He proclaimed
passionately that Mick was older than His-
tory—that he had been rambling about and
behaving himself like a gentleman before
Cain finished Abel. He wouldn’t mind bet-
ting a tenner that Adam had used him to
hose the Garden of Eden. When Adam had
gone and Eve had gone—when everybody had
gone —the old boy was still walking round
and taking, an interest in things. He had
kept going while empires had grown up, and
blossomed, and died like violets. He had

mooned round all through the Middle Ages
and the Dark Ages, dodging the knights when
he could, because he did not want to hurc a
soul. When people like Roosevelt had shot
at him, he had picked their lances and brad-
awls and things out of his hide with that
marvellous old tail and kept the peace. He
had hung on while England had changed
from Protection to Freetrade, and won Tra-
falgar and Waterloo, and grown_ worried
about Germany and fed George Reid. Time
and worry, war, pestilence, famine, flood and
earthquake had been nothing—absolutely
nothing—to old Mick. He had waved his
tail at all the weapons in Death’s armory
until he had encountered, in a time of ex-
citement, a one-garbage-cart, twentieth-cen-
tury suburban mayor in all his blanky re-
galia. That had finished the heir of all the
blanky ages. That had slain the intimate
friend of Pharaoh and Pontius Pilate, and
put the absolute blanky kybosh on the kind-
est, the most enduring, the noblest of all
created beasts. “Take yer mayor away,” he
groaned ; “take him away and wash him, and
he’s as good a mayor as ever he was. But
he’s done the work of his life to-day! Make
a note of it and put it on his tombstone that
he did what all the rest of creation couldn't
do—he knocked out Mick the Immortal with
his blanky bed-gown and his blankv chain of
office. Take away yer mayor and leave me!”
Then he sat down on Mick’s immense hind-
lev and put his hands over his eyes.
The aldermen hastily gathered up the
fihhy Mayor and staggered out with him like
dustmen bearing forth a particularly shame-
ful burden. The rest of us tip-toed after
them, and I shut the door reverently on a
broken-hearted man and about eight tons of
dead History.

Sleep.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A SOFT haze swims before my eyes,
Like golden snn on autumn willows.
The candle sinks and spits and dies, ’
My head sinks down on sleep-strewed
pillows.
My thoughts, from cold restraint now freed,
One moment toy with visions rosy,
The next regret the day’s misdeed,
While my cold bed grows warm and cosy.
The Day is done, and I have won
What I deserved of joy and sorrow;
And now I creep to Lethe sleep,
Nor care a whit what comes to-morrow.
Now Life, like last night’s candle, dies,
And men my other bed are making.
The veil is lifted from my eyes.
I know how sweet what I’m forsaking,
Yet well content. When I have lain,
One fleeting year, in bed below,
New life will come. I’ll live again
In flowers that from my heart shall grow.
The Day is done, and I have won
What I deserved of joy and sorrow.
And now I creep to Lethe sleep.
Nor care a whit what comes to-morrow.

Brahm.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A SPECTRAL film that came and went,
In its illusive way gave vent
In some unreal words which
meant:
“I think,’therefore I am.”
That phantasm only thought it thought;
A vain conception, crudely wrought:
An egotistic sham.
Which brings us up against the fact -
By Chunder’s attestation back’d —
I here is no Substance, Thought, nor Act;
Nothing assists hut BRAHM.
This quaint contraption here below
Is not a magic shadow-show,
Where phantom figures come and go,
As held by old Khayyam.
A show has time and place enough,
But here we only have such stuff
As dreams are made on —mental fluff,
And visionary flam.
Throughout the universal scheme,
Be sure “things are not what they seem
(To quote a well-known psalm) :
They’re only whimsies of a dream,
A transient dream of BRAHM.
All through the cycles of the Past —
At which Notation stands aghast —
He has subsisted, first and last,
Lone, functionless and calm.
Nothing extraneous can obtrude
Upon his Sabbath quietude,
Or discompose his tranquil mood,
For nothing is but BRAHM.
“The Past and Present here unite
Beneath Time’s flowing tide” (to cite
A bard of Uncle Sam) ;
For Time, stretch’d out in aeons dim
To Apprehension’s very rim,
Is insignificant to him,
A bagatelle to BRAHM.
For once, in his negation deep,
He somehow chanced to drop asleep;
And through that forty-winks there ran
A flitting dream. So Time began.
He dream’d this stellar lens of ours,
Which mocks at telescopic powers—
Innumerable suns sublime,
At furious speed, yet keeping time ;
And so remote that, to the eye,
They look like fixtures in the sky.
But that’s a trifle. Round about,
A million light-years further out,
The wisps of nebula portend
Sidereal schemes without an end.
And this is no poetic flight,
Nor idiotic blatherskite,
Nor what is termed a cram —
However vast these plans may seem,
They’re only figments of a dream,
A. trifling dream of BRAHM.
He dream’d our System’s fiery gas
Condensing into solid mass ;
And during several billion years,
Evolving planetary spheres.
But take this globe, alone, to prove
How things have moved- —or seemed to move.
He dream’d some pulpy form of life;
Mutation slow; and savage strife ;
With Nature’s forces all in play,
And Darwin’s system under way ;
While bits of hide and tufts of hair
For countless centuries fill’d the air ;
And only those were left alive
Whose fitness caused them to survive—
Monsters that lived in gulfs of slime,
With names which balk and baffle rhyme ;
Prodigious sloths, whose daily food
Was half a ton of leaves and wood ;
Grim saurians of terrific strength,
A quarter of a mile in length ;
Unsightly bats, with twelve-foot wings,
And endless tribes of fearsome things—
Cull’d down, in point of fact, so fit
That they would thrive in Sheol’s pit,
And breathe its exhalations thick,
Holding their own with Ancient Nick.
And so, while ocean bottoms rose,
To stand awhile as high plateaux,
And mountains sank beneath the main,
To rise time after time again;
And rocks were formed, and strata rent,
And Polar ice-caps came and went;
And geologic ages pass’d,
Each an improvement on the last;
And on the wrinkled crust of earth
More decent forms of life had birth :
Man was evolved —a product queer;
A breed that it would pay to shear ;
And which, it might be safe to say,
Has reach’d a higher stage to-day ;
Since restless generations gone
Have passed a few ideas on.
But, bear in mind, this human race,
Diverse in color, smell and face;
These offshoots from the simian stem,
The sons of Japhetli and of Shem,
The progeny of Ham,
With mongrel races that infest
The isles and mainlands, east and west,
From Chili to Siam,
Are less than ripples on a stream;
They’re only ripples on a dream,
Namely, the dream of BRAHM.
Even that race, divinely nursed,
Which for its virtues has been cursed
And booted unto seven times seven
By every nation under Heaven—
The seed of Abraham ;
And those brave lions in their den,
Each one a match for aliens ten,
With fist or rifle, bat or pen—
I mean God’s modest Englishmen,
Whose very fog is balm;
These are less tangible withal
Than shadowy rabbits-on-the-wall.
Nothing exists but BRAHM.
Our swarming brethren of the North —
Whatever you may judge them worth—
Sling Muck and Soojee Ram,
Are fantods like yourself and me,
Though differing somewhat fn degree
Nothing exists but BRAHM.
The Fatman, dining at his club
On costly wet and sumptuous grub;
The pilgrim in the roadside pub ;
The washerwoman at her tub;
And Jacky in his native scrub,
On bandicoot and yam,
Are momentary sports of thought,
That flicker out and come to nought,
In this brief dream of BRAHM.
Illusion in the very air
(If such an envelope were there) ;
And things that seem to claim your care—
Your Wife, with her untidy hair;
And Grandma, in her easy chair;
And Baby in the pram—
Are all a visionary crew;
Which fact need never worry you,
For you’re an apparition, too.
Nothing exists but BRAHM.
But flies are in the ointment sweet,
And jumpers in the cheese we eat,
And maggots in the treacherous meat,
And mildew on the jam.
That is to say, we might complain
Of many a kink in things mundane ;
Of barbarisms that still remain—_
For instance, “sport” imposing pain ;
Monarchial “loyalty” inane;
The gnats at which the Wowsers strain;
The camels that they entertain;
Sectarian bigotry insane ;
The ruthless quest of sordid gain—
A sad, perennial stream of bane,
Which only in a sense profane
We’re competent to dam.
The feckless poet’s cult of grog;
The idle bummer’s cadge for prog;
The stern official’s odious “dog” ;
The flunkey’s meek salaam —
Such provocations, daily met,
And grounds of meddlesome regret,
Shall find their panacea yet,
With rattling promptitude, you bet,
In this same dream of BRAHM.
Unquestionably, no one knows
The likely period of his doze;
But this we know —that when he wakes
We vanish in a brace of shakes,
Without dismay or qualm.
The earth, the sun and every star
Shall vanish like the freaks they are;
The corn and oil, the flowers and grass,
The fig and vine, shall simply pass ;
The eucalypt and palm:
The microbe small, the ponderous whale ;
The greyhound swift, the tardy snail;
The lion and the lamb;
The sand and granite, quartz and schist,
Shall vanish like a so-called mist
Which the fictitious sun has kiss’d.
(Of course, they never did exist.)
NOTHING EXISTS BUT BRAHM.

Deduction.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE man who provided plots for picture
plays found his friend, Ernest Day-
bill, the touring manager, distraught.
Ernest Daybill said that the world had de-
signs on him, and everybody in the world
was carrying those designs out. In the
dramatic business he had done no good
recently. Picture shows with little Willie
dying on a rainy film, and Lady Isabel flick-
ering with Levison for half an hour, infested
all the country towns he had visited with
his four-act drama, “The Dip in the Dark,”
which included the great bedroom scene,
sheep shearing, a real waterfall, the crossing
of a chasm on a fallen tree, a wicked squat-
ter, a betrayed lady, a comedian who sat on
a bull-ants’ nest as an example of tree
humor, and a starving woman waiting her
no-better-than-she-ought-to-be-daughter in a
garret with Corinthian pillars in green and
gold marble, and the size of Parliament
House. Further, he said that actors were
had lots. They expected to be paid, and
the less they could act the more frequently
thev expected pnvment. The profession
was demoralised by Trades Unionism.
There was already a union for stage hands,
and the man who was most expert at driv-
ing nails crooked was made president; the
property man who forgot important proper-
ties oftenest was also high in the union;
even the dashed flymen got more money
than the manager; and the super who cheers
in the wrong place and spoils the scene
AFTER THE CELESTIAL SCHOOL PICNIC.
PETEK: “Hullo! What’s the matter with you?”
SMALL BOY ANGRL IN SISTRESS: “BOO hoo! Billy Gabriel threw a dipperful of Milky
Way all over me”
where the misleading lady, who has been
turned from her home, and is forced to eat
snow for sustenance, he was —well, he was
damnably greedy and unjust.
He went on to say that limelight men
had bowels of brass, and that the orchestra
had forgotten the little it had ever known
of music in the work of composing demands
in G sharp for higher salaries. The front-
of-the-bouse siaff had also put up wages,
which was equivalent to a brigand asking a
premium over and above the legitimate re-
ward of highway robbery.
“And now the Actors’ Union.” he said.
“Suppose—l only say suppose—that by mere
accident a real actor blows into a theatre
and gets himself engaged. If he can really
LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.
HUSBAND: “’Pon me soul, me dear, your nursegirl's very—er — shapely!”
WIFE: “Ah, then she gets notice to-day!”
act he won’t join the union. It’s the most
conceited class on earth, but it’s a very indi-
vidual class, too, and the best actor is the
most individual. Up rise all these cup-and-
saucer actors and hip-and-elbow artists, and
refuse to play with a non-unionist. The
mechanist union stops driving nails in the
wrong place. The property man ceases to
lose the revolver that’s wanted in the third
act and is never there. The flyman tries
to leave the theatre in such a hurry that
he falls off the gridiron. The scoundrel
who beats the drum in the orchestra goes
home with his instrument of torture at half-
past seven. The lighting staff won’t pull
down a switch, and the checktakers stop
robbing the management. Then the authors
will strike at wriiing plays, though that
won’t matter, because the actors can write
them with scissors and two copies of ‘After
Dark’ and ‘Uuele Tom’s Cabin,’ or for an-
other sort of play you tear out alternative
pages of ‘The Prisoner of Zenda,’ and then
copy the speeches backwards.”
He paused for breath, and the picture
plotter concluded for him: —
“The horse reporter stops criticising the
Grand Opera under instructions from his
union, and the treasurer stops faking the
first return.”
“Nonsense,” said the touring manager
very sharply. “It’s never done, William.”
“You mean it never stops?”
“William Davis, you are dilly. I mean
that the practice does not exist.”
“I thought—but never mind. Well, if
they all strike, the manager will strike pay-
ing salaries, although by that time, with
an alleged artistic profession turned end for
end. by a minimum wage for stupidity, the
audience will strike and take its amusement
at the Zoo.”
“But what’s to become of us, William
Davis? Answer me that!”
“You’re all right, Ernest. You’re out of
the drama for keeps, aren’t you? Haven’t
you opened a side show with a dwarf or a
human-voiced snake, or something?”
“Human-voiced snake be hanged! It
was a giant—the prettiest, sweetest little
gi a nt you ever saw.”
“Was? Why, is it dead?”
“It’s lost.”
“Nonsense—what size was it?”
“It was eight feet six, and proportionally
thick.”
William Davis knew that Ernest Daybill
meant “proportionately,” but he waived the
point and said :
“Well, you can’t lose a giant that size any
more than you can lose a locomotive. Al-
though I once knew a locomotive that was
lost for six months, but then a loeomotive
doesn’t eat and drink, and it can’t talk nor
walk about by itself, nor tell the police that
it has lost its father —but a giant can.
Don’t tell me you’ve lost a giant. You may
have mislaid it, but you’ll find it again.”
“I tell you it is lost. Will you believe
documents ?”
“Did the giant sign a paper saying it was
lost?”
“Oh! Don’t be a fool! It’s from the
man who owns the giant.”
“A slave!”
“No —he has a mortgage on him. The
giant owes him £97 3s. 6d. —advances and so
on —and the man who owns it lent it the
money and runs the show, and I’m the man-
ager.”
“I see! Trot out the documentary evi-
dence.”
“Here’s my first telegram—to him.”
“To the giant?”
“Oh, dammit! No. To him —the man
who owns the show.”
“I see! Well?”
“First I wire to him: ‘Giant lost.’ ”
“And did he reply?”
“Of course—here it is : ‘Giant owes £97
odd. Make it pay.”
“And did you?”
“How could I? I wired this: ‘How can
make giant pay when giant lost?’ ”
“That’s to the point, anyhow.”
“Then he wires: ‘Arrest giant immedi-
ately.’ ”
“What were you to arrest it for?”
“William Davis, we’ve been friends for a
long time, but the candor of a literary edu-
cation compels me to tell you that you have
no brains. What for? For owing my boss
money ?”
“But you can’t do that.”
“I couldn’t do it, anyhow, because I
couldn’t find it. Then I wired: ‘How can
arrest giant when giant lost?”
“That’s a business proposition, all right.”
“Then what do you think the foffl has
wired me now? ‘Giant owes £97 odd. Make
it pay with costs. If lost, arrest giant im-
mediately.’ Now, what can you do with a
man like that? You tell him the giant is
lost, and that it can’t be found, and that
you can’t arrest anything until you find it,
and he keeps on prattling along the wires
about his £97 odd, and tells you to arrest
the giant and make it pay costs. Why,
William Davis, he might as well tell me to
arrest the week before last, and collect
costs off last season’s rainbow.”
“A giant ought to be easy to find and diffi-
cult to hide. Neither of us takes cocaine
or morphia, but we can act as badly on
whisky as any Sherlock Holmes I ever saw
on any stage. Suppose we bring our colossal
intellects to bear on the problem?”
“William Davis, what are you talking
about?”
“Let’s go and find the giant. Let’s rake
the city with a fine toothcomb. There’s a
population of about 600.000 here. All
we’ve got to do is to eliminate 599,999 of
them and the giant is ours.”
Ernest Daybill was silent. Davis thought
that the largeness of the figures had fright-
ened him.
“And a giant, too,” Davis continued. “I
tell you you can’t lose a giant if he is big
enough, any more than you can lose a dwarf
if he is small enough. The only people who
can hide themselves successfully are busi-
ness men, policemen, sharebrokers and
bad actors. That’s deduction, and deduc-
tion is my strong suit.”
“But why, William Davis, why?”
“Because they’re like every other member
of their class, and their class is their hiding-
place. Come along; but give me a descrip-
tion of it before we start.”
The business manager took from his
pocket a bill with a photograph reproduc-
tion of a colossal man standing by a tram-
car, and the giant seemed to dwarf the
tram-car. The bill also contained much
information as to the height, bulk, girth
and weight of the giant, and when Davis
asked if it were all true, Ernest Daybill
looked queer and said “Yes.”
"H’m!” said Davis. “I’ll have a drink,


and then I’ll take this home and study it,
and I’ll meet you to-morrow.”-
Ernest Daybill agreed. They had a
whisky, which tasted a lit Lie like cocaine,
and made Davis more hopeful of success,
as he felt that he was following on Sherlock
Holmes’s lines by drugging himself before
proceeding to deduce anything.
At home Davis set the photo, down in a
strong light and studied it with a very
powerful magnifying glass. Why he did
t his he did not know, but he jumped at the
results.
That which all the human eye could not see
was shown by the exaggeration of the gla=s.
The man had been photographed separately,
the photograph had been enlarged, imposed
against the photograph of the tramear, and
rephotographed. Even the print from the
zinc etching could not disguise the fact; it
was so patent in its magnified form that he
ran his fingers over the print to feel the
joined edges of the super imposed photo-
graph, and then laughed at himself for do-
ing it.
Then, atom by atom, he studied the photo-
graph and began to believe that the enlarge-
inent of the man had not been so propor-
tionately great after all. Why?
He knew that the beginning and end of
the showman’s business is exaggeration of
effect. Vice has to be impossibly vicious;
virtue impossibly virtuous; and the come-
dian impossibly stupid, to fit a gallery of
mostly uneducatable people, many of whom
are drugged with beer, football and peanuts.
Giants have to be, on the bills, colossi, sug-
gesting that Anak was a mere forked radish,
and a dwarf must be inordinately wee.
He held the glass over the tremendous
vegetable in the giant’s coat—to the naked
eye only a rose, but under the glass a
colossal bloom like a Victoria Regia water-
lily. _ And then he began to suspect the
giant’s nose, and the glass swelled it until
it looked like a shin of beef. The gloves
became digitated portmanteaus; the skirt
of the giant’s frock-coat a great Axminster
carpet; the trousers a pair of chimneys in
colored sail cloth.
Stay! The trouser legs. He looked
again, and was satisfied. The giant was
an ordinarily tall man on stilts.
But
The trousers were not full, but of the
fairly close fashionable cut! If a man were
on stilts, then his feet must hold the trousers
out a foot or more from the ground, and
there was no trace of such a thing.
But the photograph on this re-examina-
SYMPATHETIC.
HE( irately ): “He called me a brainless idiot, and said I was the silliest fool he had
ever met.”
SHE ( sweetly ): “Oh, well, I think he exaggerated.”
tion did not look usual; for the camera
sees below the clothing, and by the folds
and figurements and the manner of their
“hanging” and accommodation of themselves
to the figure, the seeing eye may divine the
shape of the body under its covering. A
bad portrait does not so reveal the person-
ality. If it is very bad it shows a face
and boots and a mere clothes horse between,
so keeping up the English hypocrisy that, in
art at least, a woman has no legs, and an
earl walks on two empty tubes made of
sepia, cross-hatched with Indian ink.
The camera showed William Davis a body
that did not seem real under its clothes, anil
Davis said: “Padded!” He studied the
figure from the knees to the boots. The
knees were real, and, half the calves were
real. He brought the glass downward and
—then he saw the joint 2ft. at least above
the boots.
Then he set forth on a wilder attempt at
deduction than any ever entered upon by
that genius who was drugged with morphia,
black tobacco and Dr. Watson. He began
his attempt at the elimination of all but
one of a city of 600.000 people.
The giant would not be found near
theatres nor shows of any sort—unless, in-
deed, some jealous and rival showman had
kidnapped it. Yet that theory did not seem
worth while following. Even in the face of
the stage-managed photograph, the kidnap-
ping of a giant seemed too much like em-
bezzling an elephant.
Feeling at a dead end, Davis bought a
newspaper, that he might soothe himself
with murders, misreported politicians and
the divorce court, and he saw that the Lost
Giant had already got into print. There
was a column about the losing of the mon-
ster, and speculations as to the reason for
his disappearance. The immense one, ac-
cording to the newspaper, was a Russian
archduke, exiled owing to an unpopularity
that expressed itself with dynamite. His
archdukedom made him exceeding valu-
able in the public eye—more valuable at
least than any ordinary untitled hill of meat
could ever be.
Davis felt tremendously responsible on
reading it. The creature had become as
important as a football premiership. If
he, William Davis, picture play plotter,
could but find the missing article fame
would be his —for three days at least, and
three of immortality are enough for
any but a glutton. He determined to have
a whisky, and deduce.
He entered a bar room which was almost
directly opposite one theatre and opened its
back door on to the stage door of another
theatre.
“I’ll have whisky, please,” he said.
“Will y’ave me bulk?” demanded the bar-
man—a fairly thick Irishman, and more
than fairly tall.
“Thanks,” said Davis, and helped him-
self.
He believed he was about to drink, but he
sipped the whisky instead and began to
“deduce” before he was xeady, and against
his will.
The Irishman shambled behind the bar
like a bear that had lost all its toes. He
wiped dregs from the counter, threw a cork
at a derelict who had quivered with joy
when he saw the counter lunch, and put the
curse o’ Crummle on the said derelict as
he retreated.
William Davis set down his glass, careless
of the fact that there was still whisky in
it. Luck had come to him at the first
turn. He examined the photograph again
to make certain. Yes ! There could be no
mistake. But the height? Here was a
fatal objection. And if the giant had been
merely a tall man on stilts why did not the
feet force the trousers outwards below the
knees ?
Something in the gait of the shambling
Irishman impelled Davis to look over the
counter! Then the mystery solved itself.
The Irishman had club feet!
So full of the discovery was he, that Davis
could not finish the whisky. He had found
the lost wonder! Ernest Daybill must
know at once for Rrnest Daybill’s sake.
Then, for William Davis’s sake, the
papers and all the world must know too.
As lie made for the door Ernest Daybill
entered the bar. He was accompanied by
two gentlemen of the press, and Davis was
awed into silence for the time, for he knew
the newspapers so little that he respected
them and all that therein was.
Ernest Daybill did not appear very
pleased at the presence of his dear friend,
William Davis, but he made necessity an
hypocrisy and introduced him to the two
reporters.
They drank, and the more genial of the
two reporters lifted his glass to Ernest Day-
bill and said gravely: “Good health, and
may you find the giant soon.” The plotter
of pictures looked at the Irish barman, and
the Irish barman grinned.
“I hope we will,” said Ernest Daybill.
so piously that he looked like a reformed
rake, at a confirmation service. “I hope
so, indeed. The management has lost a
great deal by his disappearance—a great
deal. We hope to find him in time for our
grand re-opening next week.”
“And you don’t suspect foul play, Mr.
Davbill ?”
"No —though the other management would
like to have him, I know. You know he’s
a great actor, and a beautiful voice. He
sang in grand opera at the private Royal
Theatre—Potsdam, was it? No, Buda-
Pestli. No.”
William Davis
suggested “Dusthof,”
and Ernest Daybill
thought he had said
“Dustheap,” and
told him not to be
funny.
“Well, he was
singing th e r e —a
Russian Archduke
he is; perhaps on
the wrong side of the
blanket, but an
archduke all the
same —and two of
the big operatic im-
presarios were smug-
gled in as servants,
and tried to steal
him next day. They
would have suc-
ceeded only for his
tremendous strength.
He’d have made
Samson look like a
featherweight. And
Beecham and Ham-
merstein may be try-
ing it here. No-!
I don’t suspect the
Combine, although
I know they have
been struck for a
leading man lately.”
“It is causing a
big sensation,” said
the more melancholy
reporter. “This
morning we got let-
ters by the bushel
from people who had
seen the giant escap-
ing, or had theories
as to his kidnapping
and desertion.”
“Yes. We inter-
viewed three of
them,” said the more
human reporter.
“One woman re-
ported that she had
seen a giant wheel-
ing a perambulator
in a right-of-way off
Simpson’s-road, but
when we ran it to
earth we found the
perambulator had been wheeled by an im-
becile boy with a glass eye.”
“And then the old woman told us she had
seen ‘something,’ anyhow. We might have
known it was a lie by the detail of the
perambulator. If she had seen the giant
pushing a train I might have believed it.
“And another woman,” supplemented the
more human reporter, “said she knew the
giant was imprisoned in a room at Hotham
Hill because she heard it crying. We went
there, and found that a young married
couple had bought a puppy in the whining
stage, and the woman who had given infor-
mation didn’t like the young couple.”
“So damned silly,” said the melancholy
reporter. “Why should a yovmg married
couple steal a giant? Well! It’s becoming
a great sensation, and if ever yni do find
him you’ll have an immense boom.”
The deducer could bear it no longer. He
couldn’t permit these couriers of fame to
go without the knowledge of his triumph
of logic and elimination. He half turned
to Ernest Daybill and said to the wliole
world :
“My dear friend, yoUr troubles are over.
I have found the giant.”
“You!” shouted Ernest Daybill, looking
at him as if he were not a dear friend, but
a particularly interfering fool.
“Yes, I! Gentlemen! I have found the
giant. There he stands!” He pointed
dramatically at the Irish barman, and that
grinning gentleman became serious, and
bobbed behind the bar.
“Nonsense,” said the gloomy reporter.
“That chap’s about six feet two or three,
but he’s no giant.”
“Look at this photo. It’s a fake. Use
the magnifying glass. It’s an ordinary
big man on stilts.”
“Looks like it,” said the gloomy one.
“But where could he hide his feet?”
“Look over the counter, and you’ll see he
has club feet.” They did so, though the
barman becatne as shrinking as a violet, and
they saw.
Then the reporters laughed, aud said it
was a good fake, and would make a column,
and they went away at once. As they went,
William Davis looked triumphantly at
Ernest Daybill, and Ernest Daybill re-
turned the look with a glare of hatred.
“Why, what have I done now?” asked
Davis turning from the touring manager
to the giant by courtesy, and back again.
They answered him together, their rage
bubbling with the words.
“You’ve spoiled the biggest boom ever in
a side show, you interfering idiot.”
“An’ ye’d talk of me infirmity wit’ your
dirty magn’fyin’ glass, an’ yure club fate —
I’d give ye a lick over the taty trap. Wi’
yure findin’ the gynte. You’ll find a lump
on yure nose the size of a bottle, me lad —
interferin’ wit’ yure betliers.”
"But I”
“Oh, but you—you —you!”
“I’m sorry if I’ve disarranged the
plans,” faltered the deductionist. “Wasn’t
the giant lost at all?”
“Yes, at the beginning. We wanted to
get it back for the £97 3s. 6d.”
“An’ whin I saw in the evenin’ paper yis-
therday they was troublin’ about me,” said
the barman. “I wrote to Misther Daybill
tellin’ um I was here havin’ a holid’y
wipin’ glasses be reason of gettin’ drunk
and in dit.”
“And then,” continued Daybill, “I
thought what a boom! The lost giant!
Got the papers right-—working up every-
thing for a Mammoth Grand Colossal and
Magnificently Massive and Brilliantly Cor-
uscating Re-Opening next week, and you —
you—came along and give me a wav while
I’m giving more facts to the alliterative
men; and, damn you—you tell them about
your idiotic deductions about club feet and
magnifying glasses. You’re a magnifying
id.iit ”
“But you told me you wanted the giant
found,” objected the picture plotter. “So I
found it.”
“Oh, you found IT, did you?” said the
barman. “I’m IT, am I —a damn gynte
and no man? Well! I’ve- a club fist to fit
me club fate. Take that !”
Then William Davis saw a rainy film as
FROM DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW.
“It is just Purgatory living with, a jealous
husband.”
“It is Heaven compared to living with one
who isn't jealous.”
the hand that rocked the beer pump ruled
his nose.
Ide stood dazed at the blow, and at that
Ernest Daybill allowed liis hatred and dis-
gust to overcome the physical prudence
which was his law of existence. He bravely
punched the picture plotter on the nose im-
mediately in that place which the ex-gia.ht
had visited a moment before. Then quite
as courageously he ran away.
And then the picture plotter saw rainy
films for 15min.
Deductions are most safely exercised in
the absence of the subject.

MY Lady’s room! What wonders be-
hind its portals lie !
Attar and myrrh and roses, powder
and paint and dye!
Reds for her lips of ruby; snow for her
bosom white,
And blacks for her drooping lashes —ever as
black as night.
Mirrors and combs and brushes, frizzling
tongs and such—
Each in itself a trifle, but, wholly, mattering
miich.
Pads to be safely hidden under her wealth of
hair;
Plaits, to expectance bidden, dangling over a
chair.
Stockings of countless colors —articulate
blue and brown;
Patterns that shriek in circles, north-east-
erly, up and down.
Stockings that furnish glimpses of ankles
white and neat,
When those shapely understandings go pat-
tering down the street.
Garters and pink suspenders (pinker far
than my blush) ;
Ribbons and frills and laces, velvet and satin
and plush—-
Scattered in sweet confusion, under and over
her bed—
But wait till they make collusion —and
there is The Woman We Wed!
Blouses and skirts and mantles and billows
of lingerie—
Wonders woven —and wasted ! —for never a

Hats that are comic and tragic; gossamers

Letters on scented paper, a ring and a faded
rose;
A scrap of verse —on the margin a salty
teardrop shows.
What is it makes me sour now? What is
the secret here?
Tell me, oh faded flower now, and whisper
it, fallen tear.
Longings all unconceded, and griefs too great
to bear,
Possibly lie unheeded where Mabel keeps her
hair;
Thoughts that dampen her lashes; dreams
that have crossed the bar ;
Hopes that have turned to ashes, where
Mabel’s beauties are?
Legerdemain and loadstar—and two bright
stars that shine;
Mother and Maid of Magic, whose dextei’ous

The ribbons and shining tresses- -the shim-

A MATTER OF RED TAPE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the S.M. at Pomahaka re-
ceived word that Mr. Jones had
been borrowed from Romahapa
section, to relieve him on the morn-
ing of the 13th, he became quite
flustered, and so far forgot himself
as to wire the manager that, if there
was any difficulty about relieving him, he
was in no particular hurry for his annual
leave. It could stand over for a month if
that would suit the traffic office.
Traffic-manager Garth read this astound-
ing telegram several times, and then, look*
ing at his traffic clerk, muttered something
about funk.
“Curious,” he continued, ‘‘l happen to
know it is particularly important to him to
get away just now, so I asked Mackenzie, of
Romahapa, to lend me Jones, or someone
else, and although Mack did it, he did it with
very bad grace. Now he is in no huiry.
Wish I’d known before I asked Mackenzie.”
Forty miles away* in the little wind-swept
station of Pomalmka, Mr. Shepherd piled
coal into the Yankee stove which
battled with the freezing draughts as
they raged through his creaky office,
and cursed himself. This man Jones
would be sure to go quizzirg through
his books. Not that there was anything he
need be frightened of, hut Mr. Shepherd
reckoned it was impossible to enjoy a holi-
day knowing that, back at the office, he
was being stalked like a thief or a wild
beast. He’d tell Jones what he thought of
him when the brute arrived.
Just then the door blew in, and a great
blast of wind scurried round the office; but,
as everything was securely weighted
down, it did no damage. Mr. Shep-
herd rose hastily to close the door,
but met a tall, burly young man in
a Norfolk coat, with his waistband
hanging loose, his knickerbockers somewhat
damaged, and one stocking right down over
his boot, revealing a hairy leg that would
have done credit to a Clydesdale thorough-
bred.
The stranger hauled his woollen cap off,
drew his hand across liis mouth, and then let
loose a flood of oaths. He cursed the Poma-
haka County Council, he blasted the Road
Board for the same district, he threw dirt
on the inhabitants for being such a set of
crawling insects as to put up with such a
County Council and Road Board. And
finally he delivered a beautifully round-d
peroration at the heads of the people who
kept the pubs along the road. Having ap-
parently relieved his feelings, he chucked
his bike into a corner of the office and sank
dejectedly into Mr. Shepherd’s cushioned
chair.
“HoW the blazes do yob manage to exist
ill such bn adjective hole, old mart?” he iii-
tjhired ih a ( friendly toiie;
Firmly convinced that a stray lunatic had
struck the township, Mi-. Shepherd was diffi-
dent. He would do nothing to rohse homi-
cidal instincts; tie explained that some-
times it was a nice place, that the ducks
wete plentiful, the trout in excellent condi-
tion, and, when it whs hot blowing, the
climate was very bracing:
“Hooray! I’m glad to heat- it doesn’t
always blow. Well, look here, old man.
What about a mint julep to pull Us togethei
and keep hs up how it is blowing?’
“A what?” inquired Mr. Shepherd, who
was hot an fait with the refinements of dis-
sipation.
“A wet, a pick-me-up, a tiddly, or, in plain
English, a blanky drink. I’m perishing.
This cursed wind caught me dead in the face
half-way from Popatunoa. Then it chopped'

round to the side and blew me over once. A
dog capsized me a second time. And down
here, right in the middle of a terribly stony
patch, a cursed billygoat butted in and broke
me right up. But, by G—. you should have
seen that goat when I’d finished with lum.
I lis own mother won’t know him if he’s got
out of the river.” .
“Surely you didn’t drive the animal into
the river?” gasped Mr. Shepherd.
“Drive him in! Not much! I slung the
cow in; and if I could have found the owner
I’d have slung him in too. By the way, lie
isn’t yours, is he?”
“Good Lord, no! What would I keep a
William goat for?”
“God knows! What does any other ass
keep a William goat for? What were the
brutes created for? Say, what about that
drink?”
“Er —I’m afraid you’ll have to excuse me.
The rules of the Department forbid any
drinking while on duty, you know.
“Oh, be blowcd! Why, we keep grog in

lost if I take over till we’ve had a liquor to-
gether. Besides, I want you to introduce me
to this pub johnny. He mightn’t like the
look of me unless you vouch for me.”
Shepherd gasped. Was it possible that
this was the haughty and affluent Jones.
Why on earth did he come like this, lie was
a disgrace to the Department.
“Do I understand that you are the reliev-
ing officer from Itomahapa to take over this
station, sir?”
“That’s me, sonny. I m Jones, at your
service Hallo, there’s that flaming goat
back again, looking a bit cleaner but none
the worse for all the doing I gave him. 11l
have another go at him.” TT , ,
Mr. Shepherd’s fears vanished. lie had
nothing but contempt for this larrikin. It
this was the man Romahapa section was
frightened of—well, he hadn’t much of an
opinion of Romahapa section. He stood on
his dignity. - . , . , , r
“Don’t ask me to go to that hotel, Mr-
.Tones. I never firiitient it, anti I think you
are much more likely to make a Rood im-
pression oh the landlord without me than 1
1 were in your company. ’
“Right! I’ll go over and get a bottle and
see about some grub.” The weird ol^ ec l
banged oUt of the door, and When Shepherd
looked out of the window 10 minutes later
he was horrified to see Jones With an un-
wrapped bottle in his fist, careering down
the road in full pursuit of the goat which
had wrought him woe. The goat seemed to
realise that the situation was serious, and
that the man behind him could travel, for he
was going for dear life. However, when
opposite the door of the station, Jones pulled
up and puffed into the office. _
Mr. Shepherd had difficulty in concealing
his contempt, but he managed to do it till
Jones set to work on the transfer balance-
sheet. The way the larrikin ripped through
that convinced him that he had ability, any-
llo“Now, have another whisky and get to
blazes out of this by the very next train.
I’m sure your wife ’ll be glad to get away
if you’re not!” said Jones disgustedly.
“She will, indeed !” said Shepherd, who

"'“What do you do at nights?” inquired
.Tones, apprehensively. .. ,
“Read, play draughts with the wife, and,
occasionally, go fishing on the Pomahaka.
“What a life! By thunder, 111 tell Garth
this place is worth double salary, first time
I see him. Hanged if I don t.
That settled the question. He was evi-
dently a very influential larrikin But the
whistle of the incoming train broke up the
(rain of thought. He hurried out from
sheer force of habit. Jones _ hoisted his
fallen stocking and followed him. ,
“Pomahaka ! Pomahaka ! Pomahaka ! he
bellowed into the faces of the passengers
pressed against the glass as each carriage
went by. Then he turned to the guard.
“Got my bags on board, Tom i ,
“No Mr. Jones, never heard nothin or
’em." Was they coming from Popatunoa,
Mr ,Joiigs ? ,J
“You flaming idiot—where the blazes
would they be coming from. Look inside,
and make sure they haven’t been slung on
board without a blanky invoice. By Heavens,
have I to sleep in my pelt in tins cursed
refrigerating hole to-night? If I survive
I’ll shake some one up over it.
Then Tom went inside, and found tne
missing bags, which he bundled out. 1 e
passed out a diminutive mailbag and a
couple of parcels, and inquired in a crest-
fallen voice if Mr. Jones were “Right away.
Jones was. Tom extended one arm and
placed his whistle between his teeth.
Then Mr. Jones carted his bags inside,
went across to the hotel for dinner, and put
in a strenuous afternoon helping to load
grain, much to the horror of Mr. Shepherd,
who had always dodged that part of the
work on the ground that it was calculated
to cause loss of prestige.
Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd left by the express
for Romahapa that afternoon, and Jones
found himself alone at Pomahaka with only
the lanky cadet for company. The last train
left at 8.30 p.m., and Jones locked up the
cash, and went to enjoy life in the nub.
There he immediatelv found himself holding
a set of utter rags in a six-handed game at
Is. per corner. His partners were a local
nondescript and a stockbuyer, and the way
they went down regularly was a sight to
ipske the angels weep. By midnight Jones
had lost all his ready cash, and given Ins
watch and chain as security against an ad-
vance by Bung, and when they talked of clos-
ing up for the night, Jones went alone, bet
£5 on the result, and went down.
“I’ll square you up in the morning, gentle-
men,” he said quietly, and went upstairs feel-
ing he had been something of a fool.
“I’ve an idea,” said the stockbuyer when
they were upstairs, “that our mutual friend
with the red hair and soupy eyes was stand-
ing in with our opponents.”
“I'm certain of it —a case of raking in
foreign capital. Wait till I bowl him out.
I’m here for a month ; and some night 111
catch him, and then we’ll have some fun.
hissed Jones fiercely. * #
Next morning Jones walked to the office
and wrote cheques for his losses and what he
owed the landlord on his watch and chain.
After breakfast, lie tendered the paper. Ihe
landlord demurred :
“No offence, Mister,” he said. But 1
don’t care about cheques. You see, I don t
know you from a crow. Can’t you cash it
at the office, and give me the gonce. I
would like it better.”
“I see ! All right.”
He crossed over to his other creditors at
the fireplace.
“Your cheques, gentlemen. Ive added
exchange, as they are on a Romaliapa bank.’
The two men looked at the cheques and
sneered.
“Romaliapa is 60 miles away, Mr. Jones;
and we put up hard cash, not paper, you
know.” , , .
“Well, if you doubt the value ot the
cheques, you can wire to the manager of the
bank in Romaliapa, and I’ll pay for it. I m
sorry I cannot give you cash, as I haven t.
it.”
“Then I guess you shouldn’t play, sir.
Very well, as you haven’t the cash, I sup-
pose we must take your paper. Well ” l>
wider awake next time, I’ll swear.”
Jones shook with suppressed rage. It was
against the rules of the Department for
officers to cash their own cheques, but Jones
didn’t hesitate. Snatching the paper from
the man’s fingers, he invited him to walk
across to'the office, where he paid him out
of the till and put in his own cheque for the
amount. The man seemed surprised and
uneasy, and hesitated as though he wished
to say something. But suddenly the officer
uttered an oath, and went off at a bound,
banging the door behind him, and the aston-
ished gambler saw him bounding down the
road in pursuit of a goat that was making
° l “Mad’ < as a hatter!” he exclaimed. “Well,
d — n i l im r I’m not supposed to know he took
the office cash to pay me.” .
Then Jones, returned from chasing the
goat, made up his bank cash, entered the
whole amount as notes and silver, and
enclosed a cheque for the total to the banker
asking him to cash it and pay in as stated.
Even then he found that he had only 6s. Jd.
of office change left, and he paid in another
cheque for 335. 3d. to make that right, and
commenced the day’s proceedings in an irri-
tated frame of mind.
That night his troubles commenced. The
banker he expected to receive the cash was
away on leave, and it was a stranger who
returned the cheque with the curt intimation
that he could not be party to such a proceed-
ing. Jones’s position was difficult, for by
this time he had paid the hotelkeeper with
money from the day’s takings, and his supply
of his own cheques now amounted to quite a
respectable sum. lie was. puzzled for. a
moment, and then a brilliant insp.ration
struck him. He wrote an urgent telegram
to his banker in Romaliapa asking him to
wire him £2O, and paid for the wire out ot
the railway cash. But when he called Roma-
hapa he found the office was closed for the
night. , , . , ,
Next morning he got his wire away about
10 a.m. after a more or less strenuous
struggle, and went out to meet the train
from Popatunoa. The first person who
stepped off was the Raven, the demon audi-
tor. He was surprised to see Jones, and
Jones was disgusted to see him.
“By Jove, Raven,” he said, Ive been
wondering where you were. _ Chuck work
for to-day, old man, and let’s have a few
hours among the ducks.”
“I’d like to. Jones; but I think Id better
run through first.”
“As you please; but its the first day I ve
been here that it hasn’t been blowing great
guns. And I can’t get away to-morrow. To-
day’s a slack mid-week day. Think you d
better come right away. Got your gun with
you?”
“Yes, got everything. And. by Jove, it is
a ripping day. All right. I know I’m doing
wrong; but here goes.”
And the auditor went. * #
Jones popped into the office to say a few 7
words to the cadet.
“Jack, there’ll be a money-order telegram
for me for £2O. I’ll sign for it now, and
w r hen it cones, fix up the railway cash out
of the post office money, and my receipt for
the money order will make the post office
right. Twig!”
The cadet grinned. And while he was
grinning, Jones slipped out and headed the
auditor off up river. Once he got into the
watery thickets where the ducks were in
thousands he forgot everything. till it was
late afternoon. Jones had hurried back to
see the expresses through, and, incidentally 7,
discover if the money-order wire had arrived.
So the auditor, who had stayed to gather up
the bag, followed him leisurely. It was 4
p.m. when he commenced his audit, and by
9 p.m. it was finished. He grabbed the
book and made the usual entry.
“That’s the first time I’ve ever gone pleas-
uring without first auditing the station ;
and, hang me, if I feel easy in my conscience
about it. I don’t think I’ll ever do it again.”
“I don’t think it will ever be necessary
again, old man,” laughed Jones. “Lord, if
you’d onlv known what a scare I got!
The auditor gazed at him dazedly.
“What was the joke?” he inquired at last
in a hollow voice.
Jones explained.
The auditor gasped :—-
' “You swindling brute! O Lord, what a
bag I missed !” he said sadly.
“Well, you’ve signed, and can t get out
of it,” scoffed Jones,

Of all the swarming hive —•

Are pulsing and alive.
But they are not the land we love ;

The Girl in the Bathing Suit.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE girl in the Canadian bathing suit
on that little lonely beach was cer-
tainly beckoning to him.
Harry Truscott, skimming along the
shores of Middle Harbor in his speed launch,
the “X,” was surprised but not annoyed.'
Adventures had been lacking of late. And
what is the use of possessing the swiftest
motor launch in Sydney Harbor if you don’t
have adventures—feminine sex preferred?
He swung the “X” round in a graceful
curve, leaving the clear-cut spiral of Ids
white wake on the still water, and ap-
proached the lonely bather on the lonely
beach. The adventure looked promising;
but how often, like the woman’s face in the
depths of the bucket hat, had promises been
talsified! He decided to investigate.
She was certainly young; and as for her
hgure—the choice of the dark green, close-
fitting. Canadian bathing costume was an in-
spiration. The adventure was accepted on
sight. He stopped the engine.
To his surprise, he still heard the light
thud of the propeller. He looked astern,
and then he smiled. It was the thud of his
heart —and that heart was 39 years old.
The way on the launch brought the slim
bow, in one soft kiss, exquisitely on to the
waiting sand. The girl came eagerly for-
ward, clad in that neck-to-knee costume —
but what a neck, and what a knee!
( 'I knew you would come,” she explained.
But,” with a pout, "I’ve been waiting
hours.”
“Eor me?” Henry asked incredulously,
ihis adventure was so easy that he was
afraid. Afraid it wouldn’t go on.
“But I don’t recollect your name. Stupid
ot me to forget” He ran over in his
mind the names of the girls whom he had
kissed. It was a long list, but none of
them seemed to fit that dark green bathing
suit. b
“I’m afraid I don’t know you,” he ad-
mitted gloomily.
“You do now.”
Harry accepted the introduction. “What’s
the tiouble? he asked. “Can I be of anv
service?”
“Of course. That’s why I waved to you.
I want to be rescued.”
“But how?”
“Take me away in your launch !”
Certainly,” said Harry. “But—er
hadn’t you better dress first?” The costume
however exquisitely it became her, was
hardly the sort of attire for a lady pas-
senger in a launch on Sydney Harbor.
.Oh. I’ve lost my other clothes.” she ex-
plained with indifference. “This is all I’ve
got.” A suspicion frowned on her piquant
face. ‘ Aren't they. . . .proper?”
“Perfect,” Harry eagerly explained. “If
you get into the cabin nobody will notice.”
“That’s just what I want. I’m escaping.”
“Escaping from what?”
“I’ll tell you afterwards. They might
catch me here if we wait a minute longer.”
Harry leaped on to the dry sand, and,
seeing that she was dressed for bathing,
quite unnecessarily lifted her in his arms
and carried her into the launch. She did
not get a dainty toe wet—her bathing suit
he found was quite dry; and though Harry’s
shoes and socks got soaked, she did not
notice them.
As he gently put down his beautiful
burden he found himself bitterly regretting
that the launch had not broken adrift, neces-
sitating a long swim, with her clasping him.
But these things never happen when you
want them. He made a note that the next
time he had to rescue a pretty girl in a
bathing suit, they should happen.
_ “Here,” he said, removing his coat, and
giving her his cap, “put these on; and if
anybody notices you, they’ll think you’re a
man.”
“Thanks,” she said, as he thus partially
clothed her.
Harry knew now wliat she was escaping
from. Clothes! Women have become so
accustomed to the gyves of fashionable
attire—the torture of corsets and the tight-
ness of shoes, the horror of hair-pads and the
hobble of skirts, the pains of high heels and
the penalties of hips—that by now she is
an unconscious serf to dress. But some-
where, some time, an original woman will
rise up, and, smashing her bracelets and her
hobbles, will revert to the simplicity and the
comfort of aboriginal attire. And in the
Canadian bathing suit modern modes have
given her all the comfort and the charm of
Eve without even the clumsy necessity of
fig-leaves. (Which must have been as un-
comfortable as the modern hobble skirt, and
dreadfully worrying on a windy day.) In
his mind, Harry hailed this unknown girl as
the first sensible being of her race. She was
escaping from Clothes.
Of course, he was wrong. No woman
would ever be senseless enough to adopt sen-
sible attire.
“And now,” said the escapee, sinking back
comfortably on the cushioned seat, “what
do we do next?”
“That depends on what you want me to
do?
“I’ d be t ter tell you all about it,” she said,
vi v ot I .^ ere ’” , said Harry. “Anybody on
that cliff would spot you. We’d better
clear out. I’ll go slowly along and keep out
of people s way.”
He backed off the sand, and the “X” nosed
slowly about the deserted reaches of Middle
Harbor.
“You see, I’ve run away,” the girl ex-
plained.
“From clothes? I knew it.”
“No; from school!”
A CRITICAL MOMENT IN THE STATE OF DENMARK
HAMLET: “Alas, poor Ghost!”
GHOST (the General Utility Man has had to “take it on” owing to sudden illness of the regu-
lar Ghost): “I'm doin' my best considerin' the short notice I 'ad. And, if you ask
me, I don't think much o' your 'Amlet, though it is your regular job.”
Harry looked again. A schoolgirl? He
now saw the necessity for clothes. In that
bathing suit he had taken her for a woman
°t 24, , The auburn hair that hung loose
about her shoulders had made him uncon-
sciously put half a dozen years on her age.
All women take down their age by five years
when they take down their hair. We may
.vet see fashion dictating the wearing of
flowing hair for forlorn spinsters.
A schoolgirl? Probably 17, yet with a
ngure that —no use; better get on with the
story.
Harry had never been interested in 17:
but then he had not hitherto been introduced
10,17 in bathing attire.
bi m Tell me about it,” he urged; and she told
Her name was Jean Percival. Harry
supplied his. She considered “Harry” satis-
factory ; but “Truscott” —she had to pause
over Truscott. “You see,” she explained,
“a man’s surname means so much to a
girl.”
Harry didn’t see; and she went on with
her story.
She had been born and brought up on her
father’s little station in the Backblocks —
an only child whose mother had died before
she could remember. On that Outback pro-
perty she had been brought up almost as a
hoy. Men, save her father and a few sun-
downers, she had seldom seen.
“You’re the first young man I’ve ever had
a serious talk with,” she added.
Under the tones of that confiding voice
20 of Harry’s 39 years vanished.
She rode and worked in men’s clothes,
till at last her father, having, with a succes-
sion of good seasons, made what he consid-
ered a fortune, it occurred to him that it
was time that Jean got an education. So
he had sent her down to a boarding-school on
the cliffs of Middle Harbor.
“But I didn’t like it,” she explained.
“There were too many rules —too many
things you mustn’t do. I didn’t know how
hard it was to be a lady. So, one night, I
ran away. But they caught me and brought
me back. I told them that I would run away
again. So every night they took away my
clothes, and kept them till the morning. They
thought I wouldn’t run away in my nightie.
It was so very open-work, you see. But
they’d forgotten my bathing suit. So last
night I got into this, and climbed out of the
window and over the wall. It was dead
easy. And I’ve been hiding in the nush all
day, till I saw your launch come along. I
knew you would resuce me.”
“But how did you know I would do it?”
he_ asked amusedly, while he swung the
“X” out of range of a boat ahead.
“A young man like you would always help
a Indy in distress,” was her confident answer.
“But you might have been seen by any-
body ?”
“Oh, I took care about that. Before you
came there were two men fishing in a boat;
but they both had whiskers. And there was
a picnic party—a boatful of men and girls :
hut all the men’s arms were round the girls’
waists; and, besides, there wasn’t room for
me in the boat. Then you came.”
She looked up at Harry standing beside
the wheel —a long, scrutinising gaze from
eyes that were either green or brown—
Harry could not, from that distance, deter-
mine which.
“Have you got to hold on to that sillv
little thing all day?” she asked. “Couldn't
you tie it up, or let it whiz round by itself,
and come and sit by me?”
Harry gave the question anxious consider-
ation. They might be brown, but he rather
hoped they were green. He had never
kissed a girl with green eyes. He stopped
the engine, let the wheel go and the launch
drift, and sank on the cushioned seat beside
her.
“And how did you know I would?” Harry
asked, gazing into the brown —or were they
green ?—eyes.
“Oh, in every novel I’ve read —and I’ve
read heaps—the hero always rescues the
heroine.’ She said it with the serene confi-
dence of 17. And with an equal serenity,
she went on: “But he always claims his
reward.”
She looked up sideways at him, hopefully.
They were green. That settled it. Harry
kissed her. It was a schoolgirl kiss—the
sort of kiss girls have to spare for their
brothers-in-law.
“That makes it all right,” she sighed, sink-

She nodded seriously. “It seemed such an
easy way out of my difficulties.”
“Well, what I’m going to do is to send
you straight back to the boarding-school.”
‘No, no!” As he expected, in her fear
she clung to him. Harry found it, tempor-
arily at least, more interesting than over-
hauling his motor. He decided to prolong
the sensation.
“Then I’ll pack you off back to your
father.”
She did prolong it, deliciously.
‘You wouldn’t?” she appealed, the cling
being now a clutch.
“Well, as I’m certainly not going to
marry you—at any rate, not immediately—-
what will you do?”
The girl honestly didn’t know. Evidently
the possibility of a scarcity of heroes in her
world had never occurred to her. She let
go.

sighed.
But my mother is in England. And it
would require too many explanations to ask

new admiration. “That makes you so in-

“Perhaps; but it doesn’t help us out. I

anxiously.
"Among friends.”
It was in a quiet little sand-edged bay that
Harry slowed down and made fast' to a
ricketty little jetty. A big log fire was burn-
ing in the bush beyond the beach ; and Jean
glimpsed the white of tents and the lit
window of a big hut.
A solitary figure in trousers and shirt
came rapidly down the spindly jetty. Harrv
leapt from the _ boat and stayed ‘him lialf-

said a bearded young man with longish hair
(She noticed that they all had longish hair
She wondered, with a delightful thrill
whether she had fallen into the hands of
Pirates or of poets. Either contingency was
sufficiently exciting.) “Dinner will be
served at once.” He raised his voice
Cook-ee, lie yelled.
The cook entered. Jean thought that
desp.te his rough clothes, she hid never
seen so nice-looking a cook. He brought in
leg of mutton, and then a large dish of


vegetables, and then —to Jean’s astonish-
ment —took the vacant place beside her.
Harry, from the other side, introduced him
to her as “The Cook.” . .
During the dinner they all talked about
pictures. She found out that they were all
painters, except Harry, and lived in this
camp all the summer. Also, they were ail
hard up. She wondered how they coma
afford to keep such a good cook. She talked
with him most of the time —not about Art,
though their conversation suffered continual
interruptions, as lie had to clear away the
dishes and fetch in the rest of the meal.
“Ever posed?” asked the bearded man,
looking at her through narrowed professional
eyes.
“Oh, no,” she hurriedly said. “I’ve heard
there are girls who do —for the —the lot,
you know.” . ,
“There aren’t any of ’em with a decent
figure,” gloomed the bearded man. ‘I was
wondering if you”
“Me?” Jean blushed. “Oh, I couldn t
think of such a thing, liuw dare you ask
me?”
She turned in anger to Harry, for protec-
tion.
He explained that they were all artists,
and that artists saw no shame in the nude.
“Well, I do,” she said. “I think it’s
awful the way a girl will let a man see her
figure.” Then, with a glance round. “I
think it’s so hot I’ll take this heavy coat
off.”
Harry removed the coat. Nobody noticed
the change.
After dinner, when the nice cook was
washing up, they discussed their annual
exhibition. Jean gleaned from the talk that
each of the artists had painted a master-
piece for that show. Each was quite posi-
tive about it. But she also learned, to her
surprise and delight, that the cook had
produced, by general admission, the most
masterly of all the masterpieces.
“It’s no use,” said the bearded man gloom-
ily ; “we’re all students compared with
Dick.”
(Dick was the cook.)
Jean expressed the opinion that_ so good a
cook could be depended upon to paint beauti-
fully. Being a woman, she did not give her
main reason. Her artistic judgment was
based on the color of his eyes —the sort of
eyes a girl must gaze into —and his dark
silky hair —the sort of hair no self-respect-
ing girl could refrain very long from run-
ning her fingers through.
She was quite sorry when she found, by
stifling a yawn, that it was time for bed.
Harry led her to her bedroom —one of the
tents set back in the bush. She felt so
grateful for her rescue that she kissed Harry
good-night. In fact, she felt like kissing
them all good-night, including the cook. But
they didn’t know.
After her disappearance, there was a
solemn meeting of the men in the hut.
(Everybody was under orders to wait inside
till her light went out. Lights in tents throw
shadows on the canvas.) Harry took the
chair.
“Now, chaps,” he began, “thanks for the
way you’ve behaved. The girl’s run away
from her boarding-school, and won’t go back
to her people. They’re cockies wayback.
She’s hardly seen a man before; and she’s
got the idea, from novels, that there is
always a nice young man waiting to rescue
her and marry her.”
“Don’t wonder,” muttered Dick.
“She picked me for the job.”
“Lucky dog!” from the other men.
“Well,” Harry hurried on, “I’m not built
for that part. She’s only a child.”
“What a child!” said the cook.
“What we’ve got to do is to hide her here
—I knew you chaps wouldn’t object—till we
can think out some way of providing for her
future. It would break her heart to send her
back up-country; and if we returned her to
the boarding-school, she’d only escape again,
probably in her nightie, and wait for some
other fellow to do the rescuing bridegroom
act. And the water police will be looking for
her dead body by to-morrow. So she’ll have
lo be kept concealed in camp ; and perhaps
you can each take it in turn to stay in camp
for a day and look after her.”
It appeared that they would all be at
home next day. It was decided to draw
lots. The first day fell to the cook.
“The next thing, though it seems a pity,
is to provide her with women’s clothes. Any
of you fellows got sisters?”
None of them had. Artists can’t afford
sisters.
“Then we’ll have to buy the things.”
“Who’s going to?” asked the bearded man
blankly.
“I think she looks stunning as she is,”
said Dick. “I’m going to paint her as a
modern mermaid to-morrow 7 .”
“With the water police looking for the
dead body?” said Harry. “Not much. Who’s
going to buy the girl’s clothes and. things?”
There were no. offers.
“We’ll all have to do it,” the bearded
man suggested. “Let’s make up a list of
things a woman must have, and then we’ll
draw lots for the different —er —garments,
and each chap must buy his lot.”
They set to w 7 ork with enthusiasm to make
the list. It was surprising how many things
these bachelors thought of. When it was
complete, Harry read out the list.
“Seems enough here for a dozen trous-
seaux,” said Harry.
“She may want a trousseau—-very soon,”
the cook rejoined, darkly.
They drew lots. The cook, who had drawn
the booby prize, objected. He couldn’t go
into town the next day ; he was on duty at
the camp. So his list—a most embarrassing
one —was divided, again by lot, among the
others. .
When, early next morning, Jean peeped out
from the flap of her tent, she saw, neatly
folded, a heap of garments. With a gurgle
of delight she grabbed them and disappeared
into the tent, closing the flap. Six men, hid-
den in the scrub, heard the gurgle, and cau-
tiously skulked round to the hut.
At the breakfast call a boy, dressed in a
pair of white flannel trousers, a soft shirt,
puce striped socks, canvas shoes three sizes
too large, a coat that hung on the slim shoul-
ders very losely, a brilliant tie and a soft,
felt hat, strode unabashed towards the hut.
None of the men noticed the change. Jean
made a charming boy, with her glorious hair
well packed away in the depths of the felt
hat. The cook promptly changed his mind.
He would paint her as an Australian Apollo.
As, after breakfast. Harry was getting his
launch ready for the run up to the city with
his band of bargain hunters of feminine
Jean, who was washing up with the
cook, came running down the jetty. She
gave Harry a sheet torn from an artist’s
sketch-book, with a lovely Venus sketched on
it by the cook. Over this was a pencil
scribble in a girl’s handwriting.
“It’s a telegram,” she explained, that I
want sent to my dad. He might be getting
anxious, and think I’m drowned.”
Harry promised, and the launch departed,
leaving Jean making her way back to the
breakfast dishes.
At the telegraph office he deciphered the
girl’s scrawl. It read :
“I’m not drowned. Ran away from board-
ing school in bathing suit, rescued by a nice
young man who is going to marry me.
Jean.”
He sent the wire unaltered, and set out to
purchase the articles on his little list.
That day the shop-girls in the biggest shop
in Sydney were annoyed by the number of
young men, each with a little list, who bought
the most expensive articles of women’s cloth-
ing and accessories with brazen coolness and
painful care.
Next morning Harry ran down in his
launch for breakfast. A beautiful girl,
dressed in clothes that advertised all the
fashions prevalent during the past decade, of
colors that clashed almost audibly, met him
as he stepped ashore.
“Could you,” she said breathlessly, hand-
ing him another page from the cook’s sketch-
book, “could you please go back and send
this telegram at once? It’s important.”
Harry read it.
“Rescued from my rescuer bv another nice
young man. Going to marrv him. He’s a
cook, but paints. I’ve got the loveliest
trousseau. His picture is bought by the
Trustees for the National Art Gallery, and
we’re going to Paris for our honeymoon.”

Schedule X.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YAU shall walk the earth from east to
west, and from north to south, but,
under Heaven I submit, you will
never, never find any more monumental thing
than the impertinence of the life-assurance
canvasser. I will give you the advertising
expert, the sewing-machine drummer, and
the racecourse balancer, and yet my man
shall win by a neck —and a hide. Only once
have I heard of a good deed done by one of
this breed, and then, of course, he did it for
his own ends. The back and front of the
creature’s mind homes, like the compass-
needle, upon its north —commission.
This man, who inadvertently became a
benefactor, is now old and bald, and will
shortly die, doubtless weighed down by his
gross departure from traditional usage. Then
the craft will have reverted to its primordial
state, which is the state of Gomorrah, in
which, to a second visitation of angels, you
would be put to it to name one just map.
After this brief contemplation of assur-
ance canvassers, let us turn to a tender and
diametrically opposed theme, the bashfulness
of first love. Harry Darentli was badly in
love —so badly that his friends noticed it,
and that is not good for one’s temper. These
friends Daren’t, and it was very
just and appropriate. For he wanted to tell
the girl—her name was Milly—but he was
afraid. Many better men have had the same
trouble. Most of them have lived it down.
Darenth wondered w 7 hetlier Milly knew.
He need not have wondered. Milly always
does. Sometimes he thought he detected en-
couragement in her manner. He was right
—all her girl friends remarked upon it.
Sometimes he thought that she snubbed him.
There again he was right. She did that
when some friend’s comment reached her ear.
or when she gave up hone of ever hearing
Henry talk business. And then came the
assurance agent, just when Milly had almost
decided to accept the fourteenth proposal
from young Holroy. Holroy had been as
bashful as Henry at one period of his exist-
ence, but that had worn off long before lie
SLUM REPARTEE.

youse do ter us, wee’d corl twice a day.”
met Hilly. Experience had taught this young
man that no woman counts a proposal of
marriage exactly as an insult.
Now this is the manner of the advent of the
assurance agent, whose name does not mat-
ter. Henry Darenth sat in his office in the
twilight, composing a sonnet to Hilly. He
had composed a vast number, any one of
which, if sent to her, would have been effec-
tive. for women are not to be frightened off
when they have made up their minds. But
Henry did not send them. Instead, he locked
them in bis desk, and used to wonder how she
would feel if he died and the outpourings of
his heart were to reach sonnets and
seven odes. To such drivelling folly may a
grey eye reduce the best of the sons of men.
And, as I say, while he was at work upon
the fifteenth line of the forty-second sonnet
(his sonnets were of that brand) the assur-
ance agent blew through the open door, and,
spitting into the waste-paper basket, asked
Henry if he were insured.
Henry said he was not. He said it very
coldly, for the coarse action of the assur-

ask you moshe impor'ant queshtion....How

ance agent jarred upon his mood. He waited
for the intruder to leave.
The assurance agent fell into a chair and
put his feet on Henry’s sonnet. “My dear
friend,” he said, “have you never thought of
what it means —assurance? Have you never
reflected that when you die your wife and
children will be left to struggle with the
world alone—the great, cruel, unheeding-
world ?’”
Henry said shortly that he was not mar-
ried. He blushed as he spoke the word,
thanking the kindly dusk which hid his face
from the stranger.
“Not married!” The assurance agent
wagged an admonitory finger. “You ought
to be. Perhaps, though, it’s just as well.
Gives you a chance to get your assurance
fixed up before you light the Binomial torch.”
“Hymeneal,” corrected Henry.
“Thank you—the very word. I insured
the evening I became engaged. Yes, sir!”
Henry was interested. “You’re married,
then?” he asked.
“Sure ! Het my wife on a Bondi tram —
smoodged up a bit. Took her for a walk
amongst the smell of dead shark on the
beach —saw her home —put it to her then
and there. I’ve never regretted it. But
about your insurance, I’ve”
“Hold on! You met a perfect stranger
and engaged yourself to her after a couple of
hours’ acquaintance!” cried Henry. “Ah,
but then you’ve got the hide of a bull rhi-
noceros.” r .
“So I’ve been told—frequently. Manly
confidence, I prefer to call it. I never waste
time beating about the bush. If I see a
thing I want I ask for it. But now. let me
show you schedule X. It’s just the thing for
young men about to”
Henry sighed. “I wish,” he said, “that I
had just one-liundredth part of your beauti-
ful. invincible, enviable cheek.”
The assurance agent was mildly surprised.
Host men abused his chief stock-in-trade.
Here was one, young, good-looking and un-
married, that envied him. Henry’s trouble
began to dawn on him. Deliberately he took
his feet off the fortv-second sonnet, picked it
up, and read it. Henry looked on, too as-
founded to protest. Then the assurance
agent replaced the sonnet on the table, his
feet on the sonnet, and spoke.
“I see-ee,” he said.
Henry was dumb.
“ That's it, eh?” pursued the assurance
agent. “ ’Fraid to ask her —well, well!
Buck up and try—she’ll take you, brother,
sure. Especially if you’re insured in our
company. Now, just cock your eye over

tages offered over the other companies.

way, is she on the ’phone? Why not ring
her up now and get both jobs over?”
“She is on the ’phone,” said Henry very
curtly, “but”
“Well, just ring her up and fix things.
Don’t lose this chance of insuring with our
company. I’ll find her number for you—
what name?”
“Seven-O-five Abbotsford’s the number,”
said Henry, “but look here! Oh,—damn
it!”
“Leave this to me,” said the assurance
agent. He twirled the telephone handle.
“Hullo —seven-O-five Abbotsford.”
“I say!” said Henry feebly.
“Her name’s Hilly, ain’t it?”
said the assurance agent, cover-
ing the receiver with his hand.
“I saw it on the paper there.
But perhaps she isn’t the same
one —ye-es, Milly there? —Yes. Say,
what’s your name?”
“Good Lord!” gasped Henry,
“you’re not”
“Hurry up, before Milly comes —-
you don’t want to make a fool of the
girl, do you?”
“Darenth —but”
“No, no —Christian name—quick—
I hear her step.”
“Henry—but you”
“Ah! that you, Milly?. .. .Yes, of
course —Harry... .When is it to be,
dear?....Oh, you know; what d’you
think I’ve been wearing out the chairs
in your parlor for lately?”
Henry, partially recovering from
his stupor, rose to tear the receiver
from the assurance agent. That
gentleman waved his hand warningly,
and Henry subsided, as one hypno-
tised. The mischief, he felt, had been
done now.
“Aha!” said the Colossal Impudence at
the telephone. “You wouldn’t believe me if
I told y0u....We11, then, darling, I was
afraid — thought I was, eh?....Just as soon
as a tram’ll fetch me. Little bit of busi-
ness first.... Insurance—can’t leave my wife
unprovided for, eh?....Say, I’ll bring round
a piece of poetry when I come.... Yes,
what?” The assurance agent held out the
other receiver to Henry, who took it as one
in a dream.
“Wait a minute, till father gets upstairs,”
came the voice through the telephone.
Father presumably removed himself from ear-
shot. Then—“ Yes, darling,” concluded the
voice, very faintly, and the ring-off nearly
tore the drum out of Henry’s ear.
“Now,” said the god from the machine, “all
you have to do is to go round and kiss her
good and hard.”
Henry grabbed his hat.
“Hold on,” said the assurance agent.
“Business first. Just run over Schedule X.”
He proceeded to drag many papers from his
pocket.
“Damn Schedule X!” replied Henry.
“Bring it round to-morrow and I’ll take five
hundred pounds’ worth of it.”
“No time like the present, brother. You
might die to-night.” The assurance agent
placed a long, white form before Henry, and
held out a fountain pen. “Make it six
hundred,” he said, “and sign your name
here.”
Henry signed.
“Now, all you’ve got to do is to drop round
and see the doctor in the morning. I con-
gratulate you upon your good sense in tak-
ing out this policy. I don’t think you’ll
ever regret the day you insured with us.
Twenty per cent, bonus, and”
Henry shook his hand warmly. He felt
he could have embraced him. “I don’t think
I ever will,” he said.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT’S a highly extravagant age :
We’ve arrived, it appears, at a stage
When we most of us itch
To keep pace with the rich
While receiving a minimum wage.
It’s an age of vain pomp and display,
And of idols with feet made of clay,
While, without any gammon,
The worship of Mammon
Prevails more and more every day.
There’s a turbulent wave of unrest —
It bears us like corks on its crest —
And the idle and wealthy,
Whose tastes ain’t too healthy,
Are setting the pace for the best.
It’s a time of deceit and pretence,
And the efforts we make are immense
.Tust to give people grounds
For believing we’ve pounds
While our pockets hold nothing but pence.
It’s an era that’s bogus and sham ;
One may frequently meet, in a tram.
With a sweet ingenue
Of about forty-two—-
She is sheep masquerading as lamb.
It’s a gay and a frivolous time;
And—ignoring the truly sublime —
Society stifles
Its conscience with trifles
Alike without reason or rhyme.
Then, our wives and our daughters will
swear
That they haven’t got clothes fit to wear,
Yet these poor little martyrs
Wear gems on their garters—
So some well-informed persons declare.
At our theatres, yes, and “the halls,”
To the nude we are certainly thralls;
’Tis an era of lust —
Too much shoulder and bust
Are on view in the circle and stalls.
Once in Rome, many centuries back,
A great civilisation went crack
’Cause the bond-thralls of fashion,
And folly, and passion,
Couldn’t keep the State coach on the track.
And to-day it’s quite easy to see
That a similar slump there will be,
For our system must smash
With a similar crash
Which will bury us all in ddbris.

A Ballad of Boots.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THIS is the Ballad of Boots,
Boots!
Wellingtons, bluchers, jacks and brogues,
The Boots of fools and the Boots of rogues;
Boots of the squatter and Boots of the squire,
Boots of the ploughman bespattered with
mire ;
Boots of the man that crosses his crops
With firm and masterful strides,
Boots with mirror-like burnished tops,
Boots with elastic sides.
Boots!
Treading a way through this world of woe,
Climbing the steps of the ladder of Fame,
Echoing down through the arches of Shame
On the various paths that our Boots may go !
Boots,
Blandly pursuing their different routes
In a 1 grim processional row!
Boots that hurry for doctor’s aid
When a little life in the world is laid ;
Brand-new Boots that raise a smile
When the bridegroom creaks along the isle;
Sorrowful Boots that drag in the road
When the hearse goes by with its solemn
load.
Boots!
Boots ! Boots ! Boots !
If you keep us behind the angels
You keep us ahead of the brutes!
To your steady tramp on road and street
Our human hearts through life shall beat,
And, if one sound the Silence braves,
’Tis the sound of Boots that shall pierce our
graves.
Boots!

Conyers and His Girl.
[FOR THE BULLEIIN.]
CONYERS had got a temporary job
with a surveyor, who lived two
miles out of Sleepy Hollow. He
had not been there many days when Murty
Brown and Jim Webb called on him with a
view to enlisting his company on a trip
north. At first Mat agreed heartily to his
old mate’s proposals. He was tired of drag-
ging the link chain over hills and through
swamps and scrubs, and acting as general
rouseabout on the estate when the surveyor
was out of employment himself. But it was
unluckily mentioned that two young lady
friends of his, Fiona Martell and Selina
Saddler, had lately added to the attractive-
ness of Dozy Hollow by their beauteous
presence. The former was barmaid at the
Boomerang Hotel, while the latter offici-
ated in a manifold capacity at the Wes-
leyan Parsonage. Mat wasn’t anxious to
see Fiona, owing to previous complications ;
but he got quite excited at the thought of
meeting Selina again. She had smiled on
him once or twice in former times, and he
recalled some little acts and looks and man-
nerisms which betokened a favorable impres-
sion that might easily be cultivated to ad-
vantage. He decided to cultivate it, and
therefore the proposed trip was postponed
indefinitely.
Mat recognised the difficulties of courting
at the parsonage. He began by going to
church. It wasn’t his church, but he didn’t
let a little thing like that stand in the way.
He arrived early at the sacred building, and
at once a couple of aged brethren, having
nothing else to do, buttoned on to him, and
talked about Wesley and his tenets, and
asked. a lot of unpleasant questions regard-
ing his soul. .At the end of 10 minutes they
viewed him with suspicion.
He saw Selina enter with the Rev.
Dominic Rumsey and his wife —a tall, thin
lady in black, whose expression was a com-
bination of acid and melancholy. Mat
snrank from her at first glance, and hoped
fervently that Selina would soon get an-
other place. When the service began he
crept in with the tail-end of the congrega-
tion, and ensconced himself among the crowd
that is always at the back of a church. He
noted well where Selina was sitting, and as
the light of evening faded a little he tip-
toed up the aisle, and, getting a seat behind
her, tried in the lowest of whispers to make
an appointment.
Mrs. Rumsey, however, had a good long-
distance ear. She heard the remark dis-
tinctly, and, rising, she fled softly down the
aisle like a black ghost. When she came
back she was accompanied by two black,
bony, silent deacons. They beckoned Con-
yers out, and having got him beyond the
doorway of the sacred edifice, they told.him
simply and plainly of the everlasting hor-
rors that awaited him. Then they saw him
past the gate and a little way down the
road, after which they cast him off as an
abomination.
He didn’t go to church any more, though
he haunted the precincts of that edifice,
mingling with a lot of young men who
attended regularly outside for the purpose
or escorting. various little charmers home.
He saw Selina arrive regularly, and saw
her safely home— at a respectful distance,
lhe chaperonage of that awful woman was
a bar to further progress. He visited town
every night, and smoked dozens of cigarettes
m the neighborhood, of the parsonage. Now
then he noted his angel passing between
, use „ anc * kitchen, and threw kisses
after her from his dark seclusion. He learnt
to know her room, and when the light ap-
peared in the window he would whisper

ihere wasn t much satisfaction in a court-
ship of this kind; still it was consoling to
know that no one else was enjoying her
society in the meantime—barring the par-

so he looked forward to it as the chance of
i , He w , as road-surveying that dav,
and didn t get home till late. Worse still
lie got home tired—too tired to walk. There
was only one horse kept in, the surveyor’s
town hack, which he allowed nobody else to
ride. He objected, in fact, to any of his
horses being used on private business, espe-
cially at night. Mat, however, had never
seen him outside his own garden after dark •
so he decided for once to steal a ride, there-
by saving a valuable half-hour and his legs
at the same time.
There were two gates into the lane, but
to reach either he had to pass close by the
house. He led the horse along quietly, hold-
the bit-ring, and avoiding bare spots where
the hoofs would sound. All went well till
he got to the woodlieap opposite the kitchen.
Then, without warning, the horse shook
himself, and the sound of the agitated
saddle-flaps and stirrup-leathers was like a
thunderclap. Conyers swore jerked the
bridle, which made the horse snort and
prance about, and kick up quite a disturb-
ance. This, coupled with the perfume of
cigar smoke that came from the garden, in-
duced Conyers to rush the intervening space
as fast as the horse would lead.
There was a tennis lawn in the house-plot
behind the kitchen. The surveyor, with a
tasselled cap on his head, happened to be
smoking a cigar there, and hearing the un-
wonted clatter, he climbed over the paling
fence into the lane, and met the disgusted
Conyers just as he had mounted at the gate.
“Is that you, Conyers?”
“I’m goin’ in to see the doctor, Mr. Bar-
den,” said Conyers in a painfully strained
voice. “I felt bad, an’ gettin’ worse, so I
took the colt.”
“Oh, that’s all right, Conyers,” said Bar-
den. “What’s the matter with you?”
“I think it’s ptomaine poisoning. I
brought some sandwiches home from a party
last night, an’ eat ’em cornin’ along this
evenin’.”
“Have you contracting pains in the abdo-
men?” asked Barden.
“Yes —regular twitches me up.”
“And a feeling of nausea?”
“Yes,” said Conyers again. “Feel’s if I’m
goin’ to be seasick.”
“That’s ptomaine poisoning all right.”
Barden declared. “I’ll go in with you in case
you get worse on the road. Give me hold of
the stirrup, and we’ll get along.”
Mat’s cheek went pale, and his heart
seemed to freeze, while his tongue thanked
the surveyor. Half-way in he said he felt
better, was improving rapidly, in fact; so
there was no necessity to trouble and incon-
venience Mr. Barden with a long walk. He
must be tired after working all day.
“No, I don’t feel a bit tired,” Barden re-
plied. “I had a shower before tea. That
freshened me up.”
. “You’ll be tired going back,” Conyers con-
tinued. “It’s a long way.”
Barden laughed, and said a step like that
was nothing to him. He used to go in for
gymnastics one time.
“Kr —won’t Mrs. Barden be wondering
where you are?” Conyers suggested. “Might
be anxious.”
“Oh, she knows I went for a walk. I
was just meditating a ramble when I heard
you,” Barden answered. “I’ll see you to the
doctor’s now, then I can stroll leisurely
back.”
There was a glimmer of hope in this
arrangement. He must square the doctor,
that was all. Then he could hurry to the
Oddfellows’ Hall.
The hope was short-lived. Barden, being
an intimate friend of the doctor’s, accom-
CHOP OGIC.
MA : “ J ohnnie, you MUST chew your food. What are your teeth for?”
JOHNNIE: “Ma, whales have teeth , haven't they?”
MA : “Yes.”
JOHNNIE : “Well, if whales chewed their food , what ‘ud a become of Jonah?”
panied them into the surgery. He explained
what had happened to Conyers, and Conyers
had to describe the symptoms he hadn’t got,
though he hastened to add that he had
almost completely recovered now. r
“You’re far from recovered yet,” the doc-
tor told him. “Too pale; and your nerves
are all unstrung. I’ll give you an emetic.”
Conyers shuddered. “Is —is it necessary?”
he asked.
doctor looked at him with a frown.
If it wasn’t I wouldn’t give it to you,” he
said sharply.
T .Thenceforth Conyers submitted in silence,
it he had no contracting pains and no feel-
mg of nausea when he started, he soon
acquired them after swallowing that emetic.
What little color he had come in with van-
ished, and his nerves went to ruin. He was
kept under observation for two hours, while
Barden and the doctor picked a team of
tennis experts to play Tatham. The very
name of tennis was hateful to Conyers after
that night.
“I think you’ll do now,” the doctor said
at last, handing Mat a bottle of stuff, to be
taken every two hours —after shaking the
bottle —and a powder to be assimilated on
going to bed.
“What’s the damage?” asked Mat.
“Twelve-and-six. ’ ’
He paid it sulkily, and departed without
saying good-night.
“How do you feel now, Mat?” Barden
asked on reaching the horse.
“Oh, as right as rain,” Mat answered.
He wanted to get rid of Barden.
“Feel strong?”
“Strong as a horse.”
“Well,” said Barden, in a dry, drawling
voice, “I’ll ride the colt, and you can take
the stirrup-leather and jog alongside.”
Mat jogged alongside with the spirit of
an anarchist. When they reached home
Barden saw him to bed, gave him the pow-
der like a good nurse, and blew the light out
for him.
As soon as his boss was gone, Mat got
out of bed again, dressed in the dark, to the
accompaniment of much violent language
expressed in under-tones, hurled the bottle
at the calf-pen, and then dragged his weary
legs back to town. It was close on mid-
night when he got there. Murty Brown,
who was looking in at the door and ob-
structing the traffic, volunteered the infor-
mation that lie had just missed seeing the
belle of the ball.
“Who?” asked Mat.
“S’lina.”
“Gone ?”
“Ten minutes. Goin’ in?”
“Too late now. Jes’ toddlin’ home from a
birthday shivoo Good-night!”
Conyers went off whistling, and trying co
walk as though he was in good trim; but he
slept on a vacant allotment, among the
lucerne, that night.
For the next three weeks he was camped
in the bush, surveying State lands for selec-
tion. It was an awful time for Conyers,
during which he wondered who was talking
to Selina, who w T as presuming or conspiring
to take her out. When he saw anyone from
Dozy Hollow, he would lead the talk round
to girls, remarking finally in a casual sort
of way: “There used to be a nice little
piece at Rumsey’s when I was in town. I
can’t think of her name now?” The visitors
couldn’t either; neither could they tell if
she was still there. In the light of subse-
quent happenings, this was an unpardonable
sin of omission on their part.
The surveyors returned on a Friday, and
Mat, receiving a holiday till Monday, drew
his cheque and shifted his quarters into
town. That night he planted himself
against Rumsey’s garden wall, watching the
gate. Soon another man planted himself
against the same wall, on the opposite side
of the gate. Mat ground his teeth and edged
closer so as to have the advantage if Selina
should come out. The other man also
edged closer. They edged and edged, till
finally they met and stood up at the gate.
The other man was a slim painter, whom
Conyers knew slightly.
“You !” he said disdainfully.
“You!” echoed the painter, with equal
disdain.
There was a moment’s silence. Then
Conyers said frigidly: “If you want to see
Mr. Rumsey, you’ll find him on th’ veran-
dah.”
“Don’t want to see him.”
“Waitin’ for Mrs. Rumsey, perhaps?”
“I ain’t.”
His answers were rudely abrupt. Still
Conyers maintained his equanimity. He
fried another tack. “Know the girl here?”
“I ought to.”
“Why?”
to marr y her next month.”
Marry Selina?”
“Aye.”
Conyers regarded this as a bit of bluff •
but he felt as though he had bumped an ice-
berg, all the same.

more contemptuous. “I don’ believe she’d
<<m? n , m a foi 'ty-acre paddock with you ”
, ttatsa dirty insult!” cried the painter
hotly. Put em up !”
Mat had to put them up smartly to de-
fend himself. He couldn’t fight much, and
the painter could fight less. Still they man-
aged to accomplish a lot of damage in little
time. They smashed the gate in the first
round, and, falling inside, tore down the
nastui tmms and rolled on the bouvardias
Hurried footsteps were heard through the
house as they separated from the wreckage’
Ihey decamped with celerity, resuming hos-
tilities a few seconds later on the bank of
the river.
The bank sloped like the roof of a house
Wlt i, a r J en ' f ? ot drop at the bottom like a
wall. Ihey fought three furious, whirlwind
rounds. Then the painter, lialf-blinded and
groggy, clutched Conyers in his long arms
and fell with him. They rolled down the
steep slope, bumping and pommelling, and
dropped over the broken bank on to a police-
man, who had been crouched underneath
watching two men who were suspected of
dynamiting fish. The fall separated the
combatants, but Conyers and Constable
Murphy were knocked into the river. The
painter escaped before they got out. Con-
yers was arrested and locked up. Next
morning he was fined £5 or 14 days for
riotous behavior, interfering with Con-
stable Murphy while in the execution of his
duty, and damaging his uniform.
Conyers blamed the painter for it all, and
vowed vengeance. Half a dozen whiskies
before lunch put him in a good frame of
mind for an interview, and a couple more
after lunch set him going determinedly to-
wards the paint shop. He found the artist
breaking down white lead in an oil-drum.
“Put ’em up, yer cur!” he said, shaping
up. The painter, who had a black eye and
numerous abrasions, didn’t want any more.
He dodged behind the bench of paint-pots.
Conyers threw a lump of putty at him, and
called him vile names. That proving in-
effective, he snatched up a pot of red paint
and threw it at the tall person. That
roused the cowering tiger in him, and jump-
ing on the bench, he first blinded Conyers
with a handful of whiting, then poured a
gallon of black paint over him. When he
had wiped some of it away with a bag and
got his eyes open again, the artist had van-
ished.
A passing drayman took Conyers to his
hotel under a tarpaulin, picking up Jim and
Murty, who were looking for him, on the
way. They smuggled him to the bathroom,
and helped him to undress. Then Jim stood
back and looked him over carefully.
“I hope you left that decorator person
enough material to go on with,” he re-
marked.
“D the decorator!” snapped Conyers,
disentangling an eyelash. “What’s a good
thing to take off paint?” ,
“Boilin’ water,” Murty answered promptly.
“Oh, talk sense!” said Conyers, irritably.
“There’s another way,” Murty went on.
“I’ve seen painters burn it off o’ doors, an’
scrape th’ charcoal off with knives.”
Conyers turned on him fiercely. “Am I
a door?” he demanded, bending forward and
clenching his hands.
Murty, his chin gripped between thumb
and forefinger, studied him seriously for a
moment. “Y’ ain’t a door,” he replied with
decision. “Seems to me you wur intended
for a painter’s signboard.”
Conyers answered him with a snort of
disgust. He stepped into the bath, and
soaped himself till he was white with lather;
but it had no apparent effect on the paint—
except that it gave Murty a new idea.
“Y’ have the wrong soap, Mat,” he in-
formed him. “What th’ cook uses for clean-
in’ tli’ stove, which is every bit as black as
you are, is Monkey Soap”
Conyers heaved a wet sponge at him.
Then he looked at Jim with the mute appeal
of a bogged sheep in his eyes. ‘
“Among the cognoscenti,” Jim responded
impressively, “the usual remedy adopted for
the removal of tar is fat, applied externally;
so, I presume, the same prescription will
answer for the present disorder. Get you
to the chemist. Brown, and order a hogs-
head, to be delivered immediately and with
promptitude.”
“Chemist be hanged!” growled Conyers.
“Go down to the cook.”
Murty departed, and in a few minutes re-
turned with a bucket of tallow. Rolling
their sleeves up they rubbed at Conyers till
they were tired. Then they soaped him and
showered him, and soaped him again, till
they got the fat off. But the paint re-
mained.
Conyers turned from the looking-glass in
disgust, and threw the tallow bucket out of
the window.
“Go down to Radicliffe’s coach factory,
Brown, an’ ask them for something to take
off paint. Be quick !”
Murty bustled out, while Conyers sat
down on the edge of the bath tub, 'and Jim
squatted in the corner and commented.
. Murty returned with a quart of turpen-
tine as. the. tea-bell rang. They wrapped
the patient in a blanket, sent his tea up to
him, and later on resumed the process of
making him white. In the course of the
night they accomplished the task, with the
exception of some body streaks, and some
spots in the angles of his ears and the cor-
ners of his eyes.
He kept to his bed all Sunday, taking the
rest cure; but after tea he went down to
the church to watch for the painter. He
saw him come from the rectory with a big
fat girl on his arm.
"Who’s that?” lie asked a bystander.
“Selina Jackson—girl at Rumsey’s,” was
the answer.
Mat leaped. “Why,” he said. “I thought
a girl named Saddler was there?”
“She was there for ' three weeks. Left
quite a while ago.”
Mat.went away into the darkness to kick
himself.

A Romance of Moonshine and Bones.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE moon was shining up above,
And also down below ;
It was a perfect night for love,
As nights in Sydney go;
For when the moon is very clear
My Nancy’s lips are warm and dear.
I do not mean that they are cheap
When storm-clouds wrap the sky,
And heavy rain-drops try to keep
The world from getting dry ;
But when the night is all a-shine
They press more clingingly to mine.
The moon is not supposed to care
For lovers such as we,
But I have found her very fair
If treated decently.
She never says or does a thing
To shame our young imagining.
On this white night of which I tell.
The airs were warm and free.
Rocked on a mild and gentle swell
One moon sat in the sea,
The other floated through the night
To see that everything was right.
We were as happy as two birds
Close-roosting on one twig.
We did not put our thoughts in words
Because they were too big;
I found it good to sit and sigh
And watch the moon in Nancy’s eye.
When, suddenly, my soul was ’ware
Of something standing near —
A person of affrighted hair
And visage pale and clear —
A spirit-person thin and blue,
Whose breast the silver moon shone through.
I rose and stood before the shade —
It took away my breath
To see the way the high lights played
Upon the ribs of death.
But Nancy very sweetly said :
“See, George, the gentleman is dead.”
Her courage drove away my fear,
My heart grew strong and stout:
“Kind sir,” I said, “what make you here?
Therg are no graves about.”
He answered in a hollow tone,
“There are ■ you’re sitting on my own.”
He stroked his spirit whiskers down
With bony fingers thin;
His features made a pleasant frown,
His cold eyes shone like tin:
“How do you think I can keep dead
With you two spooning o’er my head?”
“I had been sleeping sound and well
A century or two;
I liked the pleasant earthy smell
As decent corpses do;
But your infernal kiss would spoil
The best six feet of virgin soil.”
“Good sir,” I said, “we will away ;
We really did not know
That it was your desire to stay
Down peacefully below,
You took us somewhat by surprise,
But humbly we apologise.”
He laughed a laugh of merry scorn,
Of merry scorn or sin:
“I was a pirate bred and born,
And maids are good to win;
For one warm kiss of those red lips
I’d sell my soul and burn my ships.”
He looked at Nancy, and my breast
Was filled with jealous rage.
“My friend,” I said, “you’d better rest.
Considering your age,
I do not think your soul would sell
Just now particularly well.”
He laughed again—a horrid laugh:
“Perhaps you speak the truth.
The years have only left me half
A somewhat yellow tooth ;
And I have slept for such a while
I find it difficult to smile.”
The gentleman who had been dead
A century or two.
Then said “Good-night,” and went to bed
As other corpses do;
And we that haunted place forsook
Without a single backward look.
But when three days were past and gone,
I went in daylight brave
With curious eyes to look upon
The place he called his grave,
And there I saw a new wreath laid
Just where his ghost began to fade.
I stooped and turned the blossoms o’er,
Surprise about me crept
To think that someone knew before
Where this old pirate slept;
Then something hit me straight and hard,
For Nancy’s name was on the card.

THE cold American man with the lizard’s
eye and the moustache so black that it
seemed to belong to Manchuria, waved
his cigar in the air to show the large black
pearl lie wore as a finger ring, and then
touched its fellow —the large black pearl
he wore as a scarf-pin. He was cold —
snakily, Orientally cold. Yet for all his
coldness lie had humor, sardonic though it
was, and for all his disbelief in others he
believed in his own purity of motive—an
astonishing thing. He told of mining crooks
with a suggested shudder at their perfidy,
and he poured forth a tale of a Ballarat
man who took him down, and he was deeply
shocked in every case.

sell, an’ he won’t lease, an’ he won t take
royalties nor nothin’. An’, if he was to die,
we could get hold of his land an’ sink a noo
shaf 400 ft., an’ pick up the Lady Amy reef.
“Well, I was always a hoping man, an’
it never struck me that he wanted a job
and a interest for nothing. So I says, ‘Well,
one of these days when the ole man witli
the billygoat beard sittin’ on the three-legged
stool reading the noospaper dies, just you
send to me, an’ I might have a flutter at it.’
“About three years after, he come into
my orfus in Sydney. I’d sure forgot him,
but sudden a man comes in, an’ sits down
very solemn, an’ puts his hat under the
chair, an’ then he says like an Italian con-
spirator : ‘He’s dead.’
“ ‘Go on,’ I says. ‘I hope he made a nice
corpus an’ went to his funeral like a gentle-
man?’ ‘Y’ don’t know,’ he says. ‘He’s
dead ! Knutsford’s dead. Don’t you remem-
ber the Lady Amy reef at Ballarat? Ole
man with the billygoat beard sittin’ on a
three-legged stool outside a bark hut near a
ruined shaf readin’ a noospaper?’
“‘I remember you now!’ I says. ‘Well?’
“‘Well,’ he says, T got ole Billygoafs
land from his executioners, an’ if you’ll give
me a bit of a interest, I’ll turn it over to
you, an’ you sink the shaf’ an’ I’ll manage
her.’ Well, I agreed, and he told me she’d
be dry, and the 400 ft. of sinking wouldn’t
cost much. An’ he told me that we’d have
to crosscut 100 ft. at the 400 ft. level, an’
we’d cut the Lady Amy lode —4ft. of 2oz.
stone. I know more about poker than
minin’, but I put up the money, an’ let him
dive with it.
“Well, lie dove. He dove 250 ft., an’
found water. We put in a 6in. pump, an’
he got to 300 ft., an’ at 300 ft. he was pumpin’
the Yarra River. We put in more pumps,
an’ at the 400 ft. he was pumpin’ the Pacific
Ocean. He got down to 420 ft., an’ he cross-
cutted at 400 ft., and the River Thames and
the Mississippi was cornin’ in in the cross-
cut, one each side. He got along 200 ft. with
that crosscut, an’ the water would have
swamped Noah. We pumpefl three shifts
THE HOSTAGE.
TRAVELLER : "Will there be time to get a drink, guard?"
GUARD: “ Yes, sir; plenty o' time, sir."
TRAVELLER : “What guarantee have I that the train wont go without me?”
GUAED (generously) : “Well, sir, I'll go an' have one with you.”
and crosscut one shift. The only other
tragedy that was happenin’ was the pay-
sheet, arrivin’ every two weeks with the
regularity of a funeral from a’ ’orspital.
Then I said: ‘This has cost enough to square
the Legislature of Noo York State, an’ I’m
goin’ to squeal.’ He says: ‘For John the
Baptist’s sake,’ he says, ‘don’t squeal yet.
Gimme another pay.’ An’ I says: ‘Yes, two
more weeks, an’ if you ain’t on that reef
then, I’ll send the whole pratphrsition to
the electric chair.’
“About two weeks after that I am in
Bri sbdne, an’ I gets a wire: ‘Struck Lady
SO NEAR. AND YET SO EAR.—
THE IMPOSSIBLE SEEKS THE
UNATTAINABLE.
Amy reef.’ I couldn’t get to Ballarat quick
enough. I took a minin’ man from town,
an’ he went below an’ inspected Niagara
Falls. We had struck the Lady Amy. reef
sure, an’ the Lady Amy reef was 3in. wide,
an’ worth 2dwt. Then I squealed so you
could hear me in Texas. An’ he says: ‘For
Heaven’s sake,’ he says, ‘let me sink on her.'
An’ I says, ‘For the sake of your father,
Judas Iscariot, I’ll give you another two
weeks.’ So he rose on her, an’ he winzed
on her, an’ she remained the same constant
Lady Amy—3in. of eight shillin’ dirt.
Nothin’ fickle about Lady Amy—there
wasn’t. So we drew the pumps, an’ let
Lady Amy. have a good drink, an’ she filled
herself up to the sill. There was £15,000
of my money in her.
“But I hadn’t got the end of that guy—
no, sir. He had cold storage enough to
come to me three years after and want me
to go into something else. I knoo him this
time, but 1 didn’t say nothin’, but I went
on writih’ an’ he stands there in my oi'fus
turnin’ his hat round an’ round as if he
thought it was a split ring, an’ he was
lookin’ for the split.
“Bimeby he sez : ‘Y’ don’t
seem too glad to see me,
Mr. Fooljam?’
“ ‘Well,’ I sez, ‘I ain’t ex-
actly concussin’ myself into
fragments with joy.’ An’ I
said nothin’ after that, but
I kept on writin’.
“Bimeby. he ses again:
‘What was you tliinkin"
about the Lady Amy, Mr.
Fooljam ?’
“ ‘I ain’t tliinkin’,’ I sez.
‘l’m only wishin’.’
“ ‘What might y’ be wish-
in’, Mr. Fooljam?’
“ ‘Wal,’ I sez, ‘if you
want to know, I was wish-
in’ your name was Knuts-
ford, an’ that the poor in-o-
l'ensive old man with the
billygoat beard was sittin'
in front of his ole bark hut
on a three-legged stool near
a ruined poppet head read-
in’ his noospaper for ever
and ever.’ So after that he
got out.”
“Well, lie got at you,” I
said. “He must have felt
like a fly biting an anvil.”
“Oh, don’t you call any-
body on that. The wiser
the guy the easier he gets
stung —as long as it’s out-
side his own game. Only
knew one man who couldn’t
be stung, an’ he stung him-
self.”
“How?”
“Made two million, an’
then sooicided, so he should-
n’t die in poverty. But he
was a Bad Man.”
I waited to hear what Mr.
Fooljam’s idea of Real Bad-
ness was, and lie went on :
“He would float a company for a piece of
ground with nothing on it.”
We all laughed at that, and one man said
he had heard of it being done —in Iceland
or Patagonia, or somewhere.
“Oh, but not the way Barney did it. He
would form a company of, say, 150,000
shares. He would put up, or guarantee to
put up, £25,000 workin’ capital, an’ take all
the starck. Then he would put a premium
of £3 on 150,000 shares, an’ say to a few
brokers: ‘l’m goin’ to put these to £6. You
make your clients wise, an’ they can have
the starck, for 10s. a share up, and the bal-
ance standing at 8 per cent. Gimme 5 per
cent., and you keep three.’ So he’d be gettin’
5 per cent, on more than half a million that
never was on land or sea. He’d put the
starck to £6 all right, but nobody could sell
because he had all the shares. Then, after
a year, he would say, ‘l’ll eat ’em up.’ He
would bring the starck down till it was
£3 10s., an’ then the guys what had bought
the rubbish would pay 10s. a share cover.
A few months after he would say: ‘I guess
I’ll put ’em up another 10s.; an’ so he would
go on eatin’ ’em up so nice an’ slow an’ kind
that they must have felt sorry when the
operation was over.
“An’ that was Barney Dross. S’pose he
was on Charin’ Cross railway station, an’
he saw a poor little governess from Devon-
shire, an’ she had a 50-darler bill, an’ no
ticket home, an’ no small change to buy a
bun or- a railway sandwich. He would say :
‘Gimme that 50-darler bill, my dear, an’ to-
morrer I’ll give you 100 darlers for it.’
An’ then lie would take that poor little
governess’s 50 darlers, an’ go round the
corner an’ laf.
“He put up his starck by havin’ dorgs—
what you’d call touts. He had a toobs dorg,
a man who knoo all the big investors in
London toob railways; an’ a big shipbuildin’
dorg, a man who knoo men like Sir William
Pearse an’ Christopher Furness; an’ a
electric dorg, a man who knoo all big people
in electric light an’ power schemes. An’ he
had a sassiety dorg named Lord Reginald de
Puffpuff or sumpin’; an’ Lord Reg., he had
ruined about two carloads of Duchesses an’
about 60 head of Countesses through givin’
’em Barney’s tips. Barney paid all his dorgs
commission, an’ told ’em never to get in his
way in the market, or he’d hurt ’em. One
day he ses to me: ‘Fooljam,’ he ses, ‘m.v
dorgs are sellin’ me—’speshly Lord Reginald
de Puffpuff, me Park Lane dorg. They’re
sellin’ me, an’ now,’ he ses, ‘l’m going to eat
’em ud.’
“‘How do you do it?’ I asks him.
“‘I give ’em a tip,’ he ses, an’ larfs. ‘I
give ’em a tip.’
“About two weeks after that I am in
Parrus, an’ at the Grand Hotel I sees Bar-
ney, an’ he ses, ‘I was near been mistaken
for the Czar of Russia and a-sassinated. Me
Park Lane dorg, Lord Puffpuff, come in here
just now with a gun. He ses the tip I gave
him ruined him, an’ I told him that’s what
it was for. Ses he borreyed some of his
mother’s money without asskin’ her, an’ he
ses, ‘Gimme £6OOO to save me honor.’ ‘Your
honor,’ I ses. ‘Your trousers. You been one
of my dorgs for a year an’ a haf, an’ you
talk about honor.’
“Then' he ses he’ll kill himself, an’ I ses:
‘That’s a good scheme! Put me down for a
few shares. But don’t do it here. That
there carpet’s worth money, an’ I pay five
hundred francs a day for this soot of rooms.’
“Then he ses he’ll shoot me, an’ Mamie,
here, she hangs on to his gun arm, didn’t y’
Mamie? An’ he bursts into tears, an’ I
give him a cigar what was too strong for
me, an’ a glass of sweet champagne that
wes sent to me by a man who knows I can’t
drink it. An’ then he gives Mamie his gun,
an’ snoops a bit more, an’ then he ses he ain’t
got enough money to make another start
for a dishonest livin’ in London, so I gives
him a thousand francs, an’ I ses: ‘Puffpuff,
this forty pound would give a good start to
a man with brains. I hope you’ve got
brains, Puffpuff! If you have you come
back to me when you’ve made money, an’
I’ll eat you up again.’
“Well, Hope’s a funny thing. D’ye know
that guy, Lord Reginald Wasshisname —he
went away an’ got some more money from
his aunt, an’ back he come to the Thieves’
Kitchen, hopin’ he could beat Barney in a
hot market, an’ Barney et him up again.”
Hope! the bread to be baked from the
wheat that has never been sown—in a field
that never knew the plough!

The Cab Explorers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JONES was a city man who drove
In cabs the whole year through—
A long, lean, dissipated cove
Who drank till ail was blue.
He scorned the fleeting midnight train,
And laughed when it drew out;
Then sought the late bars once again.
He knew his way about.
The loud and mournful midnight chimes,
The darkened, clean-swept street,
The shouts and shrieks of foolish crimes,
The strange, hot things to eat —
All these he loved. He used to say
The place was not itself
When serious creatures of the day
Were chasing round for pelf.
Smug men with bags he looked upon
As strange time-table grubs;
When all last trains and boats had gone,
He swore at them in pubs.
Jones drove and drank for many a year;
The brave words “rush” and “Puli’
Illuminated his career
And kept him very full.
Then one night in a pub he met'
A lean man from Outback,
Who’d come to town his throat to wet
By many a drinkless track.
And he and Jones chummed up and drank
And got on very well;
Each held as much as any tank.
And had good yarns to tell.
The lean man talked of plain and bush
And desert sunsets hot,
Till Jones, wlm knew but “Pull” and “Push,”
Put down his foaming pot.
“Esstrordin’ry,” he thickly said ;
“Nothin’ f’r miles—but Space!....
Loo’ here! Before we gorrer bed,
We’ll drive roun’ to that place!”
They found a cabman and a cab;
A horse stood underneath —
A narrow, wall-eyed equine slab
With hungry yellow teeth.
They argued with the cabman there—
They almost burst their throats;
Loud curses split the midnight air ;
The cab-horse chewed its oats.
And then at last red gold was shown !
The abject cabman said:
“Orright, gents! If I’d only known!
Yes, I’ll go straight a’ead !”
Jones stopped the cab and bought a crav
Ere town was left behind ;
And then the pair went on their way,
The boundless plains to find.
Cold dawn discovered them asleep
Upon a dewy hill;
The cab-horse in a harnessed heap
Was lying very still.
Near by a cheerful magpie called ;
It woke Jones from his rest.
“Come on!” He stirred the cabman bald —
‘Don’ give the d n thing best!”
The cursing cabman woke the steed,
And roused it to its feet;
Then horse and cab did slowly lead
Towards a village street.
Two hours they lingered at the pub
i That kept the town alive;
Then Jones laid in some drink and grub,
And bade the cabman drive.
The peaceful, sunlit countryside
Affected midnight Jones;
He spoke about his past, and cried ;
He also uttered groans.
He said he’d wasted all his days,
t And now he wished to lie
Upon his back, and smoke, and laze,
And watch the cloud-flecked sky.
“An’ when I die, ol’ man,” he said,
“You bury my remains,
An’ put a nice stone at my head
Out on these splend’d plains !”
The choking bushman said he would
Perform that office grim,
But stipulated that Jones should
Do likewise unto him.
Jones waved the corkscrew: “Cert’n’ly,
I’ll fix you up! O’ corse!”
The cabman cried : “An’ wot o’ me
An’ that there blanky ’ orse ?”
Jones quickly soothed him with a drink
Capped with entrancing foam ;
Then urged him to take pen and ink
And write a letter home.
This job the anxious cabman did
Before the night came down.
Begging of Jones another quid
To send his wife in town.
Long after dark the weary band
Came to a hamlet dim;
Jones looked at it by matchlight, and
Said it was strange to him.
Cows moaned at. them, and worried dogs
Rose up and jangled chains;
The cab fell into fourteen bogs,
And suffered grievous strains.
But after hours they found the pub,
And brought the landlord down;
Then ordered drink, and beds, and grub,
And cursed his one-horse town.
Next day they started off again
Upon their quest intent;
Dry bottles on the grassless plain
Still mark the way they went.
Did they come hack? No human knows;
But in a devils’ land,
Where the North Wind for ever blows
Some gruesome relics stand.
There is a roofless cab wherein
Two fleshless humans ride;
The driver with a bony grin
Sleeps on his perch outside.
A bony horse, whereof some bits
Have fallen on the track,
Droops ’twixt the shafts. A large crow sits
Cawing upon its back.
And when the daylight hordes in town
driving slavish nibs,
The North Wind takes the sand light brown,
And blows it through their ribs.
And when at night loud shrieks are heard,
And coppers run to see,
And Life is joyous and absurd,
Poor Jones, ah! where is he?

KODAK.
The Only Jim-Jam in Captivity.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE 4ft. “tiger” crawled lazily through
one of the many rotten patches
of Cafferty’s old paling fence, and,
stretching itself luxuriantly to full
length on the soft wind-blown grass
that littered the pathway, opened its
jaws and darted its thread of a tongue at
the tiny ins cts that foolishly ventured with-
in range. The day was comfortably warm,
and insect life was abundant and sufficiently
reckless. Lazy with good living, the snake
basked contentedly, looking for all the world
like a lost walking-stick.
And when, an hour later, “Bung” Bisker
pursued his tortuous way, under the influence
of much of that which cheers and likewise
inebriates, along that same footway, his
glazed eyes lit on the snake, and he thought
it was a stick. He lurched up to it and,
clutching a portion of Cafferty’s fence with
his left hand, stooped with great difficulty
and grabbed the tiger firmly by the neck
with his right. Then, regaining his usual
variation of the perpendicular, he looked
beerily at his prize.
For a second the snake, gorged and aston-
ished, made no movement. But as its captor
held it up for further examination to see if
its owner’s name was engraved anywhere
on it it became suddenly alive, and, extend-
ing its wide jaws savagely, threw its suDple
length around Bung’s arm, and tried to draw
its head through his hand. But Bung’s shock
of surprise was only momentary. His grasp
tightened on the reptile’s neck, and a glare
of delight shone from his eyes. He drew his
disengaged left hand along the wriggling
form, and, drawing it out straight, let go
suddenly, and chuckled with glee as the
strong folds re-encircled his arm like a sud-
denly released strip of rubber. He liked this
part of the performance, and repeated it sev-
eral times. Also, he talked to the snake and
stroked it on the head with a thick and
shaky finger.
“Mos’ wonderful stroker luck,” he mur-
mured. “I’ve sheen millions of ’em before, an’
I couldn’ catch ’em. Crawl all over y’, and
w’en y ’ £ et ’ old of ’ em , they ain,t there - F , irsh

ner they didn’ — hie —’obble y’. Shpoilt ’im,

ol’ shap?”
For answer the tiger unravelled itself and
thrashed wildly about, catching Bung a
whack across the eyes with its tail.
half 7 threatened Te“njurThiske? U a S y ’fhe
tears rolled down his florid cheeks. “Thatsh
hittin’ a man b’low belt. Thatsh dirt. Go
in there, y’ roun’ ole strap.”
Miraculously evading the snake s open
mouth, seeing that he took no pains whatever
in regard to that matter, Bung stuffed the
unwilling reptile into his right lower coat
pocket, tail first, and jammed the hand that
held its neck firmly on top, thus closing the
mouth of the pocket against escape, Stag-
gering into the middle of the path he con-
tinued his slow progress in the direction of
the Cowstealers’ Arms. Half-way there he
met Dasher Moore, who thought he. saw the
chance of a drink, and greeted him effus-
ively. . , . ...
“Hullo, old Soss!” he cried ingratiatingly.
“Where y’ makin’?” .
Bung halted and regarded him conde-
scendingly. A few minutes previously he
would have greeted Dasher with aromatic
gladness; but now he was grave with the
importance of his new and scientific posses-
sion. Only last evening had Dasher ridi-
culed Bung’s assertion that there were
snakes all over the blessed place, and he had
told Bung that he (Bung) was drunk and
had the jumps. The aspersion rankled.
Bisker took a step forward and suddenly held
the tiger up for the startled Dasher’s inspec-
tion, its flickering tongue scarcely a.n inch
from the latter’s nose. Dasher emitted a
yell of horror and sprang into the centre of
the road. There he objurgated freely, and
requested the unperturbed Bung to “bash its
’ead agin th’ post, y’ fool.” Bung waxed
indignant.
“Fool y’slielf,” he shouted, stuffing the
unfortunate tiger back into its retreat. “I
tol’ y’ las’ night place w’s ov’run with ’em,
an’ —an’ —an’ —an’ y’ shaid ’twash imag’a-
sion. An’ I CAUGHT one, shee, an’ —an’ —
an’ shony real live zhim-zham ’n captiv’ty.
You” and pointing his left forefinger at
Dasher he spoke with great impressiveness—
“ You c’n go t’ hlazes —d’y’ ’ear?” And turn-
ing on his heel he continued his voyage.
A few minutes later he fled under a press
of beer canvas into the bar, and, leaning
heavily against the counter, invited all and
sundry to have a drink. He called for a
long one for himself. Taking the sleever in
his left hand he tilted it thirstily, and the
liquor fell down his throat with a sound
like that of a tank falling overboard. He
placed the glass with elaborate care on the
counter, wiped the back of his hand along
liis mouth, and dredged in his left trousers
pocket for coin. The pocket yielded no
wealth, and he recollected that his money
was in the other pocket. This, of course,
suggested complications, seeing that to get
it out he would have to use his right hand,
and that was already engaged to its fullest
capacity.
“’Ere, Scobie,” he said to a reliable
friend ; shove y’ ’and inter m’ pocket an’—
an —an’ get out couple o’ bob.”
“Why don’t yer get it out yerself?” asked
the puzzled Scobie. “Are yer too drunk or
too lazy—which?”
“I can't get it out, y’ fool,” exclaimed
Bung in righteous indignation. “I don’
wanter let ’im go.”
“Don’t wanter let who go?”
“01’ Zhim, ’coursh,” explained Bisker,
passionately. Then, remembering that his
friends were not aware of his acquisition, he
proceeded to enlighten them.
“On’y one ’n captiv’ty,” he whispered
mysteriously. “Caught’m m’shelf. I’v been
tryin’ t’ catch ’m f’ yearsh, an’ —an’—an’ —
an’ thish ’sh firsht one ever b’n caught.”
“What in thunder is it?” demanded the
impatient Scobie. “Jim-jam, or what?”
Bung smiled approvingly into his face and
breathed heavily, and Scobie hastily side-
stepped.
“Yesh.”
“Oh, it’s a jim-jam, is it?” The audi-
ence roared. “Show us it, Bung.” They
pressed around gleefully, and Bisker, smiling
and important, jerked “Jim” from his pocket
and whirled it all over the place for inspec-
tion.
There was a shout of rage and terror and
a stampede for points of vantage that offered
safety, accompanied by the crash of falling
glass-ware, as the landlord (who had leaned
far over the bar counter and, as he after-
wards alleged, “dashed near got bit”) re-
coiled with. great force- against the bottle
shelves behind. From the tops of barrels,
chairs, counter and table rang loudly-voiced
entreaty to the astonished showman to “put
his heel on it.” This advice he indignantly
repulsed, as he endeavored to show the
tractable nature of his captive by walking
around the room and holding the yawning
head out all and sundry to be patted. The
invitation invariably induced the recipient
to leap with a wild howl from his particular
place of vantage and seek another.
“For God’s sake, Bisker, take the thing
outside,” bawled Scobie, as the staggering
Bung approached him with the request that
he should stroke Jim. Scobie was on a keg
in the corner, and couldn't get past. Bisker
pushed the tiger at him till its head touched
liis coat, and in mortal terror Scobie let fly
with his foot, and, catching Bung full on the
chest, sent him staggering backwards to the
door, to fall over the mat and sprawl in the
dust outside. Someone rushed to the door
and locked it, and the head of the infuriated
Bung appeared at the window. That aper-
ture was immediately closed, and the back
door also locked. Then the mob, breathing
freely once more, breasted the bar and called
for stiffeners, what time the raucous howls
of Bung split the outside air.
Marvellously enough Bisker had held on to
the snake during his upset. Convinced at
last of the uselessness of endeavoring to again
enter the desired rum-haven, he turned his
back on the place and continued his pil-
grimage along the street. There wasn’t
much doing in the dreary little one-horse
town, and Bung aroused no attention as he
staggered along the path with the quivering
reptile coiled around his arm. From time
to time he paused to admire and examine his
charge, pressing its head behind the jaws
between finger and thumb to make it open
its mouth, or again and again pulling it out
to its full length to see its coils fly to his arm
again on liberation. It was a great posses-
sion, and Bung was very fond and proud of
it. He patted the evil head, stroked the
length of it once or twice, and then, stuffing
it away in his pocket again, pushed on till
he came to the store. Here he aroused Bed-
lam by withdrawing his exhibit when no one
was looking, and placing it to be admired on
the counter. It promptly knocked over and
smashed some crockery. The proprietress
inserted herself into violent hysterics, and
several other women who were there dis-
cusing the women who weren’t there went
into paroxysms of shrieks and yells. The
clamor scared Bung and caused him to beat
a hasty retreat.
From there he went to the Clarion office,
intending, with true public spirit, to lay the
particulars of his scientific discovery before
the editor. His intentions were good, but
his manner of carrying them out was too
crude to be appreciated. He entered the
office with Jim stowed well out of sight,
because he was aware of the fact that edi-
tors are experts in the matter of jim-jams,
and have a lot to do with them, and he
wanted to give this one a pleasant surprise.
And he did give him a surprise l-ight enough.
There were four men in the office, and they
were sitting around a deal table that hail
two legs at one end and a kerosene case
instead of legs at the other. The men were
playing cards, and it was a very interesting
game—so interesting that they took no notice
of the scientist’s entrance. The latter stood
for a moment to consider what shape his
surprise should take. The editor was one
of the four at the card table, and, as the
players took up their cards, Bung deoiled
amusedly on his course of action. Lurching
forward he breathed mightily over the four.
It had the desired effect. They looked up.
They also swore and fanned the air with
their cards. And, as they looked, Bisker
pointed mysteriously at a knot-hole in the
centre of the table. The eyes searched the
knot-hole, the four heads very close together:
and then Bung softly lifted the tiger from
his den and dropped him down on the knot
and among the four heads.
As an effect it was good. It left posi-
tively nothing to be desired. Crude it
might have been, but it was undoubtedly of
that crudeness which is the foundation of
all great art. The movement was slow and
deliberate, yet from it sprang such terrific
acceleration that even Bung was astounded.
Everything seemed to be endued with life in
its most active form within the fraction of
a second. Articles that had remained sta-
tionary for years flew around everywhere.
Staid and highly respectable pieces of furni-
ture rushed here and there in a manner mar-
vellous in anything so ancient. Yells of all
kinds of purport brought the whitewash from
the bag ceiling. It so happened that the
lock on the Clarion door was one of the
kind that are always hard to manipulate, and
have to be humored, and the scared tiger
was everywhere at once, and no one could
remain at the lock long enough to get it to
work. The population of that office was of
the shifting variety. And in the midst of
the uproar and general confusion could be
distinguished the loud and bitter lamenta-
tion of Bisker as he strove manfully to
catch his exhibit, whilst the others fled madly
before it. But the end came before the
scientist could reach his pet. One of the fugi-
tives flung a case of type at the swiftly-
gliding form of the tiger, and the corner of
it got him on the head and flattened it, and
the battle was over.
With a howl of grief the stricken Bung
rushed to the box and cast it clean out of
the country, and, picking up the wriggling
framework of his departed pet, wept hot.
wild tears thereon. They heaved him and
his dead out into the dust, but his grief con-
tinued unabated. His beloved jim-jam—the
only real, live one in captivity—had been
foully done to death, and all that noon he
mourned. Even hours later he might have
been seen silhouetted blacklv against the
setting sun. rolling in deep depression along
the hot, red road, and carrying a long, dead
snake by the middle.

BROTHER TOBIAS
F OR THE BULLETIN
Brother Tobias is down on
his knees,
Saving: his soul while I’m shelling the peas;
Down on his marrowbones there in his cell
Brother Tobias is nailing down Hell;
Paters and Aves he mumbles all day—
Brother Tobias does nothing but pray;
While his petitions go up to the sky,
Here in the scullery, “D—n him!” say I.
Brother Tobias is all very well,
With crucifix, candles, beads, prayer-book
and bell;
Through fasting and praying he always
feels faint,
In fact, he’s a sort of twopenny saint;
And Brother Tobias keeps dodging away,
To do a small penance, or steal a small
pray-;
But down in the kitchen I grill and I fry,
My prayer is a short one, “Oh, d—n him!”
say I.
Brother Tobias liis duties
would shirk,
To sneak up to Heaven,
where saints never
work;
The good Abbot’s dinner he will
not prepare,
But leaves to another his sanctified share.
He orders his halo while down on his
knees,
And hobbles about with his shoes full of
peas.
And though lie’s no angel, he’ll very soon
fly,
Tor I’ve told the Abbot! “He’ll d—n him!”
say I.

TEMPTATION
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ri HE hot day winked his weary eye,
1 At Sunset-by-the-Sea ;
And a tall, red devil came to try
The inmost soul of me;
And it really seemed, unless I dreamed,
I was Saint Anthony.
The sea was very soft and blue,
The sand was wet and brown ;
With evening lustre smitten through,
Her hair had tumbled down;
And the warm, warm air was ours to share
Some distance from the town.
The devil pulled me by the hand,
His breath was on my hair,
And loth was I to understand
Ihe thing he told me there;
His words were shame, and harm, and blame,
And very hard to bear.
Her eyes were like two stars that shine
In waters still and deep,
And they were both so close to mine
All other stars seemed cheap—
Spent lustres, made to wane and fade,
That should be put to sleep.
The devil plucked me by the sleeve,
An angry fiend was he,
With snort and hiss he seemed to grieve
The inmost soul of me,
He seemed to swell with purpose fell
At Sunset-by-the-Sea.
Her lips were like a scarlet flame,
Her laughter soft and low,
Her waist a thing that seemed to blame
An arm that was too slow;
The sands were bare, we stayed to share
The sun’s warm afterglow.
The devil pranced upon the sand,
His breath was very blue;
He did not seem to understand
Exactly what to do;
But as he swore upon the shore
I seemed to think I knew.
Her ear was like a little shell,
Bose pink, and sweet, and warm;
She leaned to me that I might tell
Soft words that meant no harm;
It seemed I knew just what to do
That moment with my arm.
The red day shut his weary eye,
The devil seemed to find
That though his breath was hot and dry,
I really did not mind.
I rose and said: “O Devil—red,
Tall Devil—get behind !”
The night was colored like a plum,
The airs were briny sweet.
The little wavelets made a hum
In whiteness at our feet ;
A lonely pair, we sat to share
That sandy dark retreat.
I saw that weary devil go,
In wrath I saw him' float,
And as he went be seemed to grow,
And rage, and swell, and bloat;
As down the track he turned his back /
, I saw his Wowser coat.
And there in gladness did we stay
Beneath the starry dome,
With joy-shocked devils far away
We heard the whispering foam ;
The night was warm, we took no harm,
And caught the last tram home.
And now when evening winks her eye
At Sunset-by-the-Sea,
No Wowser devil comes to try
The inmost soul of me;
For well I wot that I am not
The slow Saint Anthony!

“That has nothing to do with it.

grocer. “If I had a decent suit ot clothes 1

understand!” , ~ • ,
“Won’t I! I’h understand it quick
enough if there’s any sense in it!”
“Enough,” said the commander haughtily.
“Get on with your complaint.”
“When I left home,” said the fat man,
bitterly, “I thought this was going to be a
sort of excursion into the hills, aud that l
would be home for tea every night, hve
been tramping about this district now tor
over 10 days, dressed up like a fool and hang-
ing round towns until it’s darK enough to

for you three —none of you are married, and
you’ve all been on the stage, and can wear
any rotten rags. But I’m different; I hate
all this rot. The only reason I m here is
that I’m being paid. What d’ye want me
for, anyhow? Aren’t three of you enough/
“You,” said the leader to the dissatisfied
fat member, “are necessary to complete the
cast. Someone had to take the part ot bir
Roger. I looked round and found you. lou

to wear the costume provided. It is all very
simple.” , . . ,
“But what are you driving at/ wailed
the fat man. “What is the meaning of it /
“What say you, brothers?’’ asked the
leader, turning towards the faithful two.
“As you will!” they replied in unison. (It
was the formal reply set down in the ritual.
No. 23. Q. “What say you, brothers? A.
“As you will.”) , , ,
“There you go again! moaned the tat
man distractedly. “Every time I try to get
some sense out of you, you start your d—a
acting! Now look here.- You tell me what
it all means, or I’ll go to the police and tell
them you’re all mad!”
“Very well,” replied the commander, I
agree to recount the circumstances on one
condition. It is this: When I have finished
my explanation, and answered whatever
questions you may have to ask, I shall ex-
pect you to act your part with better spirit
and endeavor to sustain the character of bir
Roger as I have written it. The way you
have been going on this last day or so clogs
the action of the piece. You know you
haven’t said a word of your part for over
two days. Isn’t that so, my friend?
The fat man grunted.
“I am an actor!” cried the leader, rap-
turously, gazinv skywards. “I thank
Heaven I am an actor !” ■„
It was very affecting. He was silent tor
a little while, even after his gaze had re-
turned to earth. . .
“You,” he cried, suddenly pointing at the
stout member. “ You are a grocer!”
“Yes, I’m a grocer all right!”
“Trying to be an actor!” persisted the
leader, scornfully. _ , ,
“But I don’t want to'!” retorted the fat
man, defiantly. ‘‘lt wasn’t my choice !”
“Enough! It was mine. Now hark ye
to the story !” „
The grocer knew from bitter experience
that it was no use trying to hurry the pro-
ceedings or make any common-sense short
cuts through the wilderness of words; so he
sat hunched up with his arms clasped round
his knees, and listened wearily to the end. He
knew it all by heart. The leader had written
a play with all the scenes laid in the open
air. and the great inspiration had struck him
of acting it in a sort of real-life fashion. A
month was supposed to elapse between the
beginning of Act I. and the end of Act > . It
was the wildly fantastic idea of a deranged
THE mountain lay like a sleeping giant
in the breathless noontide heat, a
hawk floated lazily in the infinite blue,
and in the depths of the valley a toy spire
like an inverted tack pointed spitefully at
the heavens. .
The four men- who had just gamed the
summit after a laborious climb of two hours
halted and looked back.
“Behold!” said the leader, drawing Ins
sword especially for the purpose, and point-
ing with it at the valley below. “Look your
last on it, comrades. ’Twill be long ere ye
SOO it ag&in! 5
The tat man plumped down on a stone
and mopped his brow savagely with a large
red handkerchief witli a white cross m the
centre. He didn’t seem anxious to behold
anything. The two other subordinates stood
on either side of the leader even as he de-
sired, and gazed mournfully at the land-
scape spread out below them.
The leader, observing the fat man s inat-
tention, clasped both nands on his sword-
hilt, and, frowning darkly upon him, said:
“Be of good cheer, comrade ; all is not lost.
“I lcnoiv it isn’t!” retorted the fat man,
puffing out his cheeks and fanning lnmselt
with his extraordinary handkerchief.
“Then why do you despair:” demanded
the leader. “Are you afraid?”
The fat man took off his plumed hat, and,
holding it before him, examined it critically.
“No,” he answered, “I’m not afraid.”
“Well, what is the reason of these hang-
dog looks? Come, out with it!”
The fat man jammed the plumed hat on
the back of his head and burst into passion-
ate speech. “It’s the clothes,” lie shouted ;
“the d—d mad clothes! I’m a grocer—a
respectable grocer; and here I am gmng
about in broad daylight dressed up as it I
was at a fancy-dress ball. You and the
other two are actors, and are used to dress-
ing up. You aren’t ashamed of yourselves.
I am!”
“So, Sir Roger, you have failed me
again!” . ~
“Call me by my right name! said the
grocer, wildly. . . Cl . _
"Your name m this piece is Sir Roger!
• “I don’t care what it is in your rotten
play ! My right name is George Smith, and,
what’s more, I’m going to clear out, and
whatever wages you owe me you can keep.
If things hadn’t been so bad in the grocery-
business I never would have joined your
blooming Outdoor Drama Company. I won’t
go round the country any longer dressed up
like a lunatic, even if I have to go insolvent
the minute I get back !”
“What say you, brothers?” asked the
leader, turning to the two loyal adherents.
“Shall we let him go?”
For answer they drew their swords aDd
clashed them together in the air. “Onward !”
they shouted. “Onward !”
Then the leader ranged himself in line
with the other two, and they each made him
a sweeping bow. “Farewell!” they said,
and, without further ceremony, moved off in
single file, and, threading their way through
the boulders that strewed the summit, were
lost to sight. .
The ex-member sat for a little while with
his chin in his hand staring vacantly at the
ground. Then he took off his plumed hat
and examined it attentively from all points.
“Idiot!” he hissed slamming it back on his
head, and straightway relapsing into his
former abstracted state, he sat for an hour
or more without further movement.
Suddenly a thought seemed to strike him.
With a cry of despair, he caught up his
sword and ran clumsily in pursuit of his
former companions.
The mountain went on sleeping.
“Silence!” commanded the leader, as the
mysterious three sat round the evening camp-
fire. “I hear something!”
Somewhere in the bush there was a crash-
ing of undergrowth as if a confused rhino-
ceros were making its way towards them.
“Don Carlos Footlite!” cried a distressed
voice.
The leader rose. “It is Sir Roger, he
muttered. “He has come back to us. Be
prepared, comrades!” He drew his sword
and advanced to the edge of the clearing,
the two adherents following at a respectful
“Advance, Sir Roger!” commanded the
chief.
The crashing of bushes re-commenced, and,
after an interval, something in human shape
came out of the darkness, one leg at a time,
and stood before the party of three.
“So, Sir Roger, you have come back to
us!”
“Yes, I’ve come back.”
“Why?”
The fat man waved the remnants of his
plumed hat in the moonlight. “Because I
haven’t got the courage to go back alone in
these confounded clothes. That's why.”
“Are you willing to take the oath of alle-
giance once more, Sir Roger?”
“I wish you wouldn’t call me that!”
“Wilt thou take the oath, Sir Roger?”
“All right then. I’ll take it!”
“Swear him, comrades,” directed the chief,
drawing a little apart.
The fat man was duly sworn, kneeling on
the grass before the two faithful members.
It was a long ousiness, and he sneezed twice
before it came to the end, and he was allowed
to stand up.
“Was it well and truly done, think you?
asked the commander.
“It was well and truly done,” responded
the faithful two.
“Then will we sup,” and he led the way
back to the fire, followed closely by the two,
and with the fat man stumbling along at the
rear of the procession, sneezing and swear-
ing under his breath.
When they had eaten the evening meal,
the leader stood up and made a short speech.
“Comrades, the one hour of the 24, during
which, to oblige our friend Sir Roger, we
throw aside romance and hold discourse of
sordid things, is at hand. I call, on Sir
Roger.” Then he sat down, and Sir Roger
commenced. . ,
“I’m sick of this tomfoolery—sick to
death of it; and, what’s more, I don’t know
why I ever came. Good Lord ! .Fancy me
■ —a respectable grocer —doing this sort of
thing!” He shook his pudgy fist at the
leader. “This comes from listening to you!
Going to revive the days of Romance, are
you ! What sort of all idiot do you think
Thespian who had come into a legacy. He
(the grocer) had been precipitated ridicu-
lously Ynto the harmless bit of lunacy by pov-
erty chance—the chance that shop
was located near a certain cheap theatre,
and the actor had bought onions and sun-
dries from him. He was tired of wondering
why and how his series of misfortunes had
been capped by this final degradation. ...
He woke from a gloomy reverie. T e
leader’s voice had gone up one octave. Me
was being talked at.
“Yes. comrades, one may do much wit 1
money in this strange world ot ours. Une
may, for instance, hire grocers. / Hired a
grocer. Behold him!” ~
“Well, that’s enough about grocers,
snapped the fat man savagely. ‘ You haven t
told me yet what all this rot means, or how
much longer you are going to go on.
“It means that Romance is not dead, and
it will go on for at least two weeks more .
The tradesman rose unsteadily to his feet.
“Do you mean to tell me that we won t get
home for two weeks! Dammit, you cant
mean it! TWO WEEKS!”
The leader answered him coldly. I nave
done, Sir Roger,” he said. t<T
“But look here,” pleaded the fat man, I
can’t stay away another fortnight ! I gotter
get home before the end of this week.
Surely” , „
But the commander took a roll ot manu-
script from his pocket and read out: -Yet

As he spoke, he ‘feat down on a log, and tell

The First Officer, without any further
delay, turned to the grocer, and remarked:
“Here, comrade, we are safe from pursuit.
I would fain hear the rest of thy warlike
and bloody history. Wilt tell me? But
even as the grocer was struggling with ms
wrath, a swinging light emerged from the
scrub to the right, and advanced steadily in
the direction of the company.
“Hold!” muttered the stage-manager, 1
hear voices.” , T • 1 a
There were two voices —both Irish —ana
they belonged to the invisible spirits that
carried the lamp. The fat man sighed with
thankfulness, and waited silently to see what
the strangers wanted. In another minute or
so, two shadows, with a hurricane-lamp,
tramped up out of the gloom, and, while °he
held the fight aloft, the other demanded, in
a stern, official tone: “Are you min th
thravellin’ circus that wint through Jam-
beroo this mornin’?” .
“Who goes there?” cried the leader drama-
tically, springing to his feet and laying his
hand on the hilt of his sword. .
“Th’ sergeant av polis from that same
town, and th’ owner av certain ducks that
has mystairously disappeared. We thought
maybe you fellies might know somethin
about thim.”
“Ods blood, fellow,” shouted the infuriated
commander, “I will make you eat youi
words ! 5 *
“That’ll do yez!” yelled the Sergeant.
“Give over yer play-actin’ and answer civilly
or it’ll go harrd with yez! Do ye know
anythin’ about th’ missin’ property ?
The leader turned to his two loyal sup-
porters. “Brothers, I think I _ will answei
the fool according to his folly.”
“Give over!” commanded the Sergeant,
sharply. “Quit that tomfoolery and answer
th’ queschin!” , _ „ . „ . f ~
“Gently, I pray you ! Tell me, first of all,
what ducks you seek?”
“They was my ducks, said the lantern-
holder, bitterly. “Five pair av prize Ayles-
burys, and you know it, ye thievin hound!
I-le'turned to the Sergeant. Divil a fowl
can I kape at all at all since these idle
gypsies started wanderin’ round th country-
side There’s not one iv them that isn t a
thafe, and as for gettin’ one av thim t do
a day’s work, why, they laugh m yer face.
I offered these loafers a job at diggm spuds
only yesterday mornin’, and they as good as
towld me t’ go and be hanged—at laste
that’s what I gathered from their nonsen-
sical way av talkin’. Th’ ony wan av thim
that acted dacint was the stout chap over
there. He seemed inclined to take it, but that
impudent loafer over there towld him t’ re-
mimber his oath and that he wasn t th head
of the band.”
“Are ye sure lie used thim words, Mr.
Casey?” inquired the Sergeant, eagerly.
“As sure as I’m standin’ here. The wife
and Norah will bear out what I say, for
they was standin’ by at the time.”
“That settles it,” said the Sergeant, de-
cisively. “Come on, you chaps, and don’t try
any funny business. We’ll continue this dis-
cussion at the station. Get up, all of yoz!”
The leader rose with an assumption of
jauntiness, and his two faithful followers
took his lead. It was all in the play: Fate
had given the policeman and the desolate
duck-owner a part apiece, and it was plain
that the next scene was to be laid in the
police station. If you looked at it in that
light, it was almost enioyable.
But the anguished grocer couldn’t resign
himself to the situation. He was a plain,
matter-of-fact person, and police to him
simply meant disgrace. It was the pride of
his life that he had never been mixed up in
anything. He scrambled to his feet, and,
jamming his plumed hat over his ears, ad-
dressed himself to the Sergeant: “It’s quite
true what the gentleman says, sir. I wanted
to take the job, but these others wouldn’t let
me.”
“What d’ye mean be that? Why have ye
got to do what they tell ye?”
“Because they employ me.”
“What do ye mean by employ ye? Do yez
belong to th’ troupe?”
“Yes, I do belong to it, but I hate it." I
didn’t always do this. I’ve only been at it
lately. I’m a grocer by trade.”
The Sergeant was plainly shocked at the
admission. “What in Hivin’s name made
ye take up with these sort av people? Are
things so bad in your line that ye’ve got to
go round th’ country dressed like a clown?
Is wearin’ thim clothes part av -th’ con-
tract?”
The grocer glanced disgustedly at his
remarkable raiment, and admitted that it
was.
“But,” pursued the Sergeant, “what sort
av performance is it that ye give—tumblin’
or sword-swallowin’, I suppose?”
“Fool!” shouted the leader. “Fool! it is
neither!”
“Silence, you!” roared the Sergeant. “If
you spake like that agin I’ll charge you with
insultin’ language.”
The leader sneered and relapsed into
silence.
“It’s acting,” hissed the grocer. We act
all the time.” .
“Where do ye give your performances?”
The grocer waved his arms helplessly.
“We don’t give regular performances. It’s
a sort of all-day and all-night business. We
act everywhere.”
“Well, who pays t’ see ye act?’
“No one pays—at least, I never saw any-
one pay. I don’t think anyone is expected
to pay.’ It isn’t worth anything, anyhow.”
“How do ye get along? Do ye take up
collections?”
“No, we don’t take up collections. ’
The Sergeant took a deep breath.
“Well then, tell me this —who pays th’
travellin’ expenses and your wages?”
The grocer, by this time bereft of all
speech, pointed mutely at the leader.
“Where do you get the money for this
perambulatin’ waxworks?” demanded the
Sergeant, fiercely. ,
“That is mine own affair, replied the
leader, coldly. T . „
“The sort av fool answer I expected, re-
torted the Sergeant. “Well, for th’ time
bein’, it is also my affair: so you and your
friends will walk in front while me and Mr.
Casey get some more particulars from this
honist man ye’ve led astray and dressed up
like a pantaloon. Step lively now, and don t
trouble to give any more lip till I ask ye
for it!” . ' ' ,
The cavalcade then started for the road—
the leader and the two loyal members in
front, and close behind Casey with the lan-
tern, supported on one side by the Sergeant
and on the other by the fantastic and
wretched grocer. It was a wildly incon-
gruous group, and, as if to make it look even
more absurd, the white-faced moon rose in
astonishment over the hills, and, flooding the
whole land with misty light, made the sway-
ing lighted lantern appear a mere mad
superfluity. It only needed an audience to
make it a shrieking comedy; but the solemn,
shadowy countryside was fathoms deep m
sleep, and the baying of dogs on distant
farms was the only sound other than the
steady shuffle of feet on the road, the stern
questions of the Sergeant and the answers
of the unhappy tradesman.
For three-quarters of an hour they
tramped steadily along, and all the time the
grocer gesticulated and explained, until the
Sergeant fairly grasped what it all meant.
Then there was the sound of a big man s
laughter, to which was presently added the
thin cackle of the duck-owner. The grocer
would have made it a trio had he been dif-
ferently garbed. The best he could manage
under his plumed hat was a sort of death’s-
head grin.
The laughter was overheard _by the three
actors in front, and they realised that the
Philistines had come to some sort of under-
standing. ~ ,
“Our comrade has betrayed us! grumbled
the leader as they tramped.
The others murmured a suitable assent
—out of the ritual.
And far in the rear, the Sergeant, now
quite free and easy, hastened to reassure the
grocer. “’Twill be all right. If it is. as ye
say—and I have no doubt you’re tellin’ th’
truth —there won’t be any trouble at all, at
all. I’ll send these loonies off about their
business, and you can stay with us th’ night
and go down by the mornin’ train.”
“But,” interjected ■ the tradesman, ‘ what
about clothes? I haven’t got a thing but
these.”
“Now, don’t worry about that. Sure, I
can fix ye up with a suit that me eldest boy
Dan lift behind when he went off shearin’ a
fortnight ago.” .
“Thanks, Sergeant. But I hope he isn t
as big a man as his father.” The small,
round grocer measured the -Miceman with
his eye, and glanced disconsolately at his
own legs.
The Sergeant wrinkled his brows and
sized up his absent son in his mind.
“Yes, I think Danny is a bit smaller. He’s
a fair-sized felly, but I think I can give him
an inch or so in height.”
The grocer sighed. “I daresay I will be
able to fill the coat and vest well enough.
But I’m very doubtful about the trousers!
I’m really afraid about the trousers!”
Then the moon retired hastily behind a
cloud, and all was darkness save the dancing
glow of the lantern.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A POOR, unfortunate Pagan dwelt in a
beautiful isle beyond the sea;
Though all he wore was a beaded
belt, yet he was as happy as
he could be;
He lay in the shade of a fruited palm,
By a reef-locked lake which was always
calm,
While the ocean thundered an endless psalm
to that poor, unfortunate Pagan !
That poor, unfortunate Pagan led what
some consider the worst of lives,
For he was maintained in board and bed by
a couple of dozen of buxom wives !
He hadn’t to work for a single day,
And he hadn’t a penny of rent to pay —-
Oh, Life was easy, and glad, and gay for
that poor, unfortunate Pagan !
That poor, unfortunate Pagan fished when
Fancy willed him to throw a line ;
He also bathed whenever he wished to cool
his skin in the crystal brine —
He ran, and wrestled, and hurled his
spear;
His flesh was firm, and his eye was clear,
Though lie feasted royally round the year—
that poor, unfortunate -Pagan !
That poor, unfortunate Pagan breathed a
tropic air that was sweet as wine ;
He looked like a god when a young wife
wreathed a garland of flowers in his
hair to twine,
And he felt like a god—for he knew no
sin—
He d no cross to bear and no crown to
win,
And whenever he slept he was well tucked-in
was that poor, unfortunate Pagan!
lhat poor, unfortunate Pagan’s mind was
wholly simple and quite unvext;
To him, this Life seemed pleasant and kind
—he never troubled about a Next!
His theological light was dim,
feo, anything that was strange or grim
He labelled the great god JAM, or JIM —

A highly-sanctified Christian dwelt in a far-
off, busy and dismal town,

old;
And he was a Shepherd, and that was liis

That highly-sanctified Christian learned that,
over the sea in a sunny isle,
A poor, unfortunate Pagan yearned to mend
his ways—which were simply vile; ’
That the Pagan pined for true Christian
views,
And the history of the Ancient Jews;
Then he burned to carry the Joyful News,
did that highly-sanctified Christian!
That highly-sanctified Christian —filled with
noble zeal to uplift mankind,
And having an adequate Fear instilled in the
congregation he left behind —
Took ship forthwith to that Island fair—
That Lost, but beautiful, Island —where
The Pagan waited in meek despair for that
highly-sanctified Christian !
That poor, unfortunate Pagan gazed with
joy and wonder upon his face;
Said he: “/ fear you will be amazed , and
shocked, and grieved at this heathen
place;
It certainly is a charming spot;
l like it myself —though you may not,
For it isn’t your style—hut it’s all we’ve
got!” said that poor, unfortunate
Pagan.
The highly-sanctified Christian sniffed:
“My friend,” he said, "we will alter
that!
First, each of your -wires must wear a shift,
while you, yourself, will assume a
mat!
I leant a house and a church built here;
And a lot of your folks to dig and clear —
And just stop brewing that filthy beer!” .said
the highly-sanctified Christian.
That poor, unfortunate Pagan stared; he
wanted to swim in his crystal pool!
But, just to show that he really cared, he
built a house and a church and
school;
He dug and cleared for about a mile,
And sowed and reaped in an earnest style,
While the Christian smiled with a kindly
smile on that poor, unfortunate
Pagan!
The highly-sanctified Christian then re-
marked that he would require a store ;
A long canoe with a dozen men; a wharf
and a shed with a massive door;
And serving-girls and carriers stout,
To carry his merchandise about—
And that Pagan promptly trotted ’em out
for the highly-sanctified Christian!
The poor, unfortunate Pagan asked what
else there might be that lie could do ;
For a year he had neither fished nor basked,
and there were corns on his fingers,
too!
He longed for a dip in the clear lagoon,
And a glorious, dozy afternoon,
While to doff his clothes would have been a
boon to that poor, unfortunate Pagan !
The highly-sanctified Christian frowned
when the Pagan proffered his mild
request
To be permitted to just loaf round in his old,
traditional Sunday best.
“I think not, Brother,” the Good Man
said ;
“If the work is finished, we’ll pray instead.
And, after prayer, you can — er —go to bed!”
said the highly-sanctified Christian.
The poor, unfortunate Pagan winced; still,
out of politeness, he had to go—
But little gratitude he evinced for his beati-
tude here below!
The great god JAM, and the great god
JIM,
Had, heretofore, been enough for him—
But he humored the kindly Christian’s whim,
did that poor, unfortunate Pagan.
The highly-sanctified Christian preached an
eloquent sermon, there and then!
His pulpit manner and learning reached the
stubborn hearts of those heathen men ;
For ever since then they’ve tilled the
ground.
And praised the Lord with a joyful sound :
And The Plate goes round, and round, and
round, to that poor, unfortunate
Pagan !
The highly-sanctified Christian still is run-
ning the show on that lovely isle;
While the Pagan hustles and sweats for nib
he smiles on him with a glad kind
smile;
And lie writes to the distant and dismal
town,
Where the billows of smoke go rolling
down,
That he lives in hope of winning the crown
of the highly-sanctified Christian!
That poor, unfortunate Pagan still is spend-
mi , mg Ilis time ’ twixt Work and Prayer,
1 hough, now and then, he bolts to a hill knd
broods on things in dark despair;
His theological light is dim,
For Work and Prayer appear to him
Far worse than the great gods JAM and
JIM of the poor, unfortunate Pagan !

Tapu.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OLD SAM, the trader, had been inter-
rupted twice in his tales of the
Islands, and was growing angry. And
when a high-heeled cove of strife, fresh from
the city, said there was no such thin" as
tapu, Samuel boiled over from head to foot:
Lapu ! W hat does a parcel of greenies
like you know about it? Nothin’ in it! My
bloomin’ oath! I bin tapu myself, and I
ought to know.”
Someone told the high-heeled cove of strife
that if he spoke again he would get his head

sister. What an
ugly walker she is!"
FRIEND OF THE FAMOLY:
“ Yes, but she's a lovely

and feet torn off, and be thrown over 10
precipices. The track being thus cleared,
so to speak, Samuel was invited to supply
details of the heathen mystery.
“I was keeping a store among a tribe of
Maoris in the Ws,” he said. “There was
about 500 in the village, an' I was doin’
fine in the matter o’ shekels. There was
a 200-acre clearin’ round the settlement on
the bank o’ the river, an’ all the rest o’ the
country was a bellowin’ wilderness o’ thick,
thick bush an' nightmares.
“Rum an’ tobacco I sold to the old bucks.
An’ I did a roarin’ trade in print stuff an’
lollies among the wahines. Gum I took iu
exchange. The old shandrydran of a steamer
from Auckland came up river once in two
months with the trade-stuff an’ took away
me gum.
“There was a scaly old buck with an
extra-carved pliysiog., lived iii the village.
They called him Awa Paki, or some gibber-
ish to that effect. Bone-scraper to the tribe,
he was, it bein’ his duty to dig up the year-
old corpses, scrape an’ polish the bones, an’
prepare ’em for the second burial, when
they held another tangi on ’em an’ put ’em
away in a hollow tree dr a bird’s-nest or
some such place. Every .time he did the
ghoul business, he was tapu for six weeks.
Nobody mustn’t go near him or the tapu
would get them, too. They’d put him bv
bisself in a little whare that stood back
from the village an’ chuck his food to him,
same as a dorg. An’ he was a dorg, too,
only worse, as I presently found out. The
tapu was most virulent on his hands, which
had handled the dead ’un, an’ he mustn’t lift
his victuals for fear o’ pisenin’ liisself. He’d
go down on all-fours an’ get his teeth into
’em that way.
“Quarantined he was up to the hilt, an’
if he touched you it was sudden death an’
a million blue devils. If you saw him cornin’
in the bone-scraping season you dropped all
other engagements and ran for it*
“The last two summers whs sickly ones,
an’ corpse-raisin’ was busy. Figure it up
for yourselves—six weeks’ tapu an’ seven
or eight bone-scrapings in a year. Awa was
a man to keep clear of most o’ the week. It
might be his clean day when you met him,
or it might be his corpse day. llow could
you tell? I was new to the hang o’ things
then, an’ didn’t understand all their darned
hanky-panky. And, by bad luck, Awa got
Ins knife into me for stopping his credit.
I was bagging gum, in the open, one
mornin when the resurrectionist walked up
holding out a shilling and clamoring for
tobacco. As it was a cash transaction, I
was glad to see he’d got over his doldrums,
so I. passes him the time o’ day, an’ shakes
his insanitary flipper before I goes to prize
him out a fig o’ Venus from the keg. He
went away quite friendly an’ grinnin’ like
a terrace of devils.
“ Twas settling day, an’ I looked for the
crowd to come along from the village with
gum to cover their tick. The steamer was
nearly due, an I wanted it bagged and
ready No, you fool, I didn’t want to bag
the steamer; I wanted to bag the gum, But

about it, when up stalks old Hona, the
Ciller, an half a dozen headmen. A mission
nigger was Hona, an’ could patter English
above a bit.
“ ‘Seen Awa ?’ he says.

bit ago.

tenance set like a thunderbolt o’ mahogany.

goods.’
‘“What yer givin’ us?’ I says, an’ a lot
more besides. Mind you, I kep’ my end
up. But there I was, a lone white man
among 500 browns, an’ I didn’t know what
bag o’ tricks they might spring on me.
"It was no good. ’Pears old Awa had
laid for me for some time, and I was fool
enough to jump straight into his trap.
There’d bin a bone-scrapin’ the day before,
and the skunk had come over a-purpose,
with all his deadness fresh upon him, to
shake the hand that stopped his credit.
“ ‘Tapu!’ says Ilona. An’ ‘tapu,’ says
the other six, nodding their heads like owls.
‘ln three days you'll go mad. On the fourth
you’ll die!’
“I tried to stick out my chest, confident-
like, but I saw what was afoot, an’ all hands
kep’ a-starin’ at me with their eyes till it
went to me head. What ’ud you a done?
Think a bit. I could feel the tapu cornin’
on there and then. It began with a sort of
sinkin’ in the pit o’ the stummick, an’ on
top of that was a shaltin’ jim-jam, an’ on
top o’ that a nightmare, an’ above all there
was a cold fear and an icy perspiration.
I hat made a four-storey tapu, and, by way
of attic, I felt a craving to howl like a dog.
‘Do you know, they stared me clean out
of that store, and stared me backwards up
the hillside, though they never laid a finger
on me. An’ then they stared me into a new
wooden shanty they had built that morning.
It was fresh and clean an’ werry com-
fortable to die in, as Hona pointed out. They
put in three bottles o’ rum to help me to
glory, an two fat men wi’ 10ft. spears
mounted guard outside the door. An’ there
they left me with the sinkin’ at the pit of
the stummick for furniture, an’ the jim-jam
ter my only cooking utensil, an’ the night-
mare fer a bunk. An’ if I wanted a window
curtain, I could use the cold perspiration.
In about two hours I started to do a dog-
howl. In four hours the hut was so full of
blue devils that I had to keep throwin’ ’em
out three at a time to avoid suffocation. I
used to. take a devil by the feet, whirl it
three times round my head, and shoot it
downhill.
“Billy Armstrong, the skipper, came along
just six hours after the first devil. He
heard me barkin’ up the hillside, an’ he an’
the engineer came up with a spanner, an’ an
axe an a coal shovel. After they had
stunned the two warriors they dug through
a solid bank of magic and fantods an’ got
me out. They hustled me aboard the
steamer an dropped down stream before the
crowd could get over from the village. I

The Coming of Pan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“op HE great god, Pan, is dead!”
That low voice that despairing cried,
A Among the reeds complaining, lied.
Not Pan, his worshippers had died;
And he in horror fled
The silence grim that seemed to hold
The dedicated forests old,
Glades nymph-deserted, altars cold.
Pan fled; and blatant Home
Met him with formal eulogies,
Stout senators, intent to please,
Embalmed* him in their bald decrees,
Gaunt temples for his home.
But when the Goth contemptuous came,
And flung this ruined world to flame,
He found Pan not, nor knew his name.
Pan waited till there broke
A sudden Spring renascent, proud:
For Italy had cast her shroud
And blazed in splendor: trumpets loud
His sullen silence woke.
He leapt to keep with Youth his tryst.
But found cathedrals tall sufficed;
And he was crowded out by Christ.
Then sombrely he went
World-wandering, an outcast lone.
The Gothic fane had overgrown
The woodland temple he had known:
Life’s joy was drained and spent.
For to this world of wan and thin
Hypocrisy had entered in
A cowled and monk-like thing called Sin.
And now his world grew small:
Where once shy, rustic joy had birth
Grey cities festered on the earth;
The only temples in that dearth
Were factory chimneys tall;
No echoes in drab suburbs woke;
There were no dryads to evoke;
The world was clogged with drifted smoke.
He hungered for release,
And south and south and south he went,
Till suddenly he'laughed content,
Reaching the last, lone continent.
A larger, sun-laved Greece —
Steep gullies snowed with wattle-gold,
Vast, bronzen eucalypti old,
White beaches where white breakers rolled!
Triumphantly he trod;
To sunny glades he shouting skipped,
A*nd out from their grey eucalypt
The joyous, wakened dryads slipped
To frolic with their god.
He blew his pipes along the sand,
And to him rippled sea-nymphs, tanned
With sunshine —surely this his land !
And sacred was each stream :
He found his altars in the shade—
White tents set up in every glade—
And many a wistful, mortal maid
In thrall of some old dream:
Along the beaches white he found
His throngs oi devotees, the browned
Sun-worshippers—’twas holy ground !
And loud his pipes he blew,
And crowding to his gladness came
The Austral poets to proclaim
Their new god’s ever-swelling fame,
And lead his retinue.
These people were a people freed,
From narrow church and coffined creed,
And Pan’s old gospel their new need.
Had he no heralds? Nay,
In Araluen Kendall set
His lone Greek shrine —’tis standing yet —
And Daley’s fane none may forget;
And Morton and McCrae
Lead in the god’s glad throng the van.
Brave music fluting. . . .If I can,
Let me, too, breathe thy pipes, God Pan!

Fatal to Women
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE bar was deserted, excepting for a
solemn-eyed man with a fat face.
The barman sat reading a weekly
paper. A stranger came in and called for a
beer, and when the beer was served, sat
sipjfing it not far from the solemn-eyed
man, who watched him with a fixed, hyp-
notic gaze. Still the young man went on
sipping his beer, seemingly quite unconscious
of the other man’s scrutiny.
“Yon will excuse me a-starin’ at you,
mate,” said the solemn-eyed man at last.
“But I was just a-studyin’ of yer physi-
ognomy.”
“Well,” said the stranger, pleasantly, “I
hope the prospect is agreeable.”
“Don’t know ennythin’ about yer pros-
pects, me young friend,” said the solemn-
eyed man. “I’m not a fortin-teller. I’m
on’y a physiognomist—a bloke wot kin read
faces. Would I be takin’ too much of a
liberty to say J bat I can see be your face
that you are a man of many sorrers, like
meself ?”
“You are in error.”
“No error erbout it. Excuse me”—draw-
ing his chair up close. “Might I be per-
mitted to look at yer ’and?”
The young man offered his palm.
“Ah!” said the man of many sorrows.
“Just as I thought. Crossed all over. I
see be this ’and that you’ve ’ad a ard past,
probably through wmmn, ,,
“Wrong. Let me tell you that I am a
happy married man.”
“Then I’m sorry I spoke,” said the solemn-
eyed man with dignity. “I beg your pardon.
It’s my mistake.” .
He pushed his chair back a few inches
and ruminated in seeming bitterness for a
few moments.
“Why is it that I have to meet men in
my path of life who are ’appily married?
he asked, fiercely. “When I meets a man
who boasts of bein’ ’appily married, I just
feels as if I could biff ’im.”
“Don’t you believe in marriage?” asked
the stranger.
“It’s because I do believe in marriage
that I wants to biff ’im.”
“I don’t understand you.”
“It’s envy. I wants to biff ’im because
he is ’appily married, when, all the time, I
knows there is no marriage for me. Because
I knows I am a blight, a curse, shut out
from the bonds of matrimony.”
“Go on! I’m sure there are plenty of fane
girls who would be glad to marry you if
you only asked them.”
“It’s not the girls’ fault that I can t
marry.” said the solemn-eyed man. “Listen,
en I’ll tell you four little tales, all of ’em out
of me own life, and then ask me why I don’t
marry.” , , ~
He thought for a minute, and then said:
“I —I —l” — each “I” being accompanied
by a gulp of the throat as if his emotion had
overcome him. Then he gave up trying to
speak, and let his chin drop on his chest.
The stranger called the barman over, and
then the solemn-eyed man gained his voice.
“A drop of my particular, EYed,” he said,
rather queerly, and still with emotion. It
was not till he had swallowed the liquor
that he could speak again.
“We was brought up together, he said.
“Who?” asked the stranger, looking at
the liquor first and then at the barman.
“Not ’im.” said the man of many sorrows.
“I mean the girl I was first engaged to. She
was a fair shiner. I won’t say enny more,
because you might not believe me. \Ve was
to be married next day, and I went out and
bought a revolver to protect the weddin
presents. We was both foolin’ about with
the wepping, it bein’ in my ’ands, when it
went off. Me girl fell back. She never spoke
nc more.”
“Good heavens! You shot her?
“I” —gulp, “I”—gulp, and then his head
fell forward on to his chest again, and he
could not speak.
“Poor fellow!” said the stranger, looking
sympathetically at him. '
“But the next one was worse,” spoke the
man of sorrow, quite broken up.
“Next what?”
“Next girl,” he said. “You know what
Shakspeare says: ‘Scratch us, and you’ll
find that all of us is only skin deep. I’m
only an humble workin’ man, but I ’ave me
feelin’s same as others _’ave. It is true I
made a vow over Nellie’s grave that I’d
never look at another woman, but I- was
only sldn deep, after all, same as other
blokes.
“It was like this. Six monce after I was
stayin’ at a boardin’-’ouse where there was
a daughter, the nattiest thing in muslin yer
ever saw. I won’t say enny more, because
you mightn’t believe me. A lot of countei-
jumpers and clerks stayed there, blokes who
look like toffs, but isn’t. They was all shook
on Lizzie. At first, I didn t take notice of
’er, but seein’ how she useter stall em on, i
thought I’d chip in just to show em that all
isn’t beer because it has a froth on it. Well,
it went further than I intended, and 1 tound
meself engaged to her, en just as balmy ovei
’er as the rest of the blokes. t
“Wednesday week was to be the weddin
day, en I had to go away for a week to do
some business. I got back on the Tuesday,
and when her mother saw me, she said:
‘Lizzie is in the front sittin’ room. You inay
speak to her, but you must not touch her.
I thought it was funny, but when I saw
Lizzie, she said as soon as I went in: Jim,
she says, ‘you may say good-bye to me, but
you must not come near me.’ En then she
told me all about it.”
The solemn-eyed man again broke down.
It was painful to see his shoulder shake.
The stranger called the barman, and as soon
as the dispenser of refreshments came up
the solemn-eyed man said: “Same as usual,
Fred,” with a little difficulty. When lie had
swallowed it he managed to speak again.
“Two men came from the next room and
took her away, and I’ve never seen ’er since.
She ’ad asked ’em to let ’er say good-bye
t 0 me ” • u 1 A
“To gaol?” asked the stranger in a hushed
whisper.
“No; leprosy, through gettin’ her clothes
washed be the Chows.”
“How awful!” exclaimed the stranger,
with horror in his eyes.
“It were bad. But the one after her was
worse,” said the solemn-eyed man.
“Impossible!” , , _
“You just listen, and you’ll see. It was
nearly a year after when I met a little
diner workin’ in a tea-room. Her name was
Rosie, the nicest little tart you ever set
eyes on. They useter dress ’em in white,
with white caps, at that tea-room. My oath,
she was a daisy, ’specially when she was at
her work. It was next to impossible not to
get shook on her Do you believe in love
at first sight? Well, it was like that with
us. She was a little toff, and I treated her
as a toff. I spent a lot of money on her at
times —sometimes half a crown at a pop.
One day I said: ‘Rosie, will you give me
your ’and?’ She offered it; and I said:
‘Not like that. I means in marriage.’ And
she said, ‘All right.’ ”
Again the sobs started to convulse him,
and he could not go on with his story till he
had managed to gasp: “Drop of the real
Mackay, Fred,” at the stranger’s invitation,
and, after drinking it, he said :
“En I got ’er ’and, and that was all I
did get.” „ , „„
“Did she leave you after the ceremony !
asked the stranger. . -
“It was like this. We useter go in tor
mixed bathing, and Rosie and me useter go
into the surf ’and in ’and. One day some
extry big rollers came in and tumbled us
over, but we didn’t let go. After they passed
I thought her ’and felt light, but I could
not look for a minute because of the salt
water and sand in me eyes. When I did
look I found she was gone. All I ’ad in me
’and was ’er ’and. Nothing more.”
“Why, wherever did she go?”
“Shark,” said the solemn-eyed man.
“Heaven save us !” cried the stranger. “I
never heard of anything like it. Most dread-
ful thing I ever heard of!”
“Better to be taken be a shark than what
’appened to the next one,” said the solemn-
eyed man.
“I don’t believe it!”
“You just listen for a minit. and you’ll
see that wot I say is true. When I came
to meself with the ’orrer of her ’and still in
mine, I said: ‘This is the limit. No more
askin’ girls to marry for me,’ I says.
“But you know what weak mortals we
are. It all came of being in a frame of
mind to ‘boast and vainglory,’ as Bobby
Burns has it. I was passin’ a selection in
the bush, and was tellin’ ’em how I could
ride an ’orse, and they put me up on an
outlaw. I ’adn’t a hope. Two bucks and I
was sent up like a catapult. And that’s all
I knowed. They carried me gently inside,
and when I opened me eyes I knew it was
all U P with me.”
“You thought you were going to die?”
“No, it was the cocky’s daughter who was
bathin’ me forehead with vinegar. By U P
I means I ’ad fallen in love again. You can’t
beat the cockies’ daughters; they makes the
finest wives in the world. You can’t wipe
’em out, you can’t. I 'ung round, and at
last I asked her to marry me, and she said
she had made a vow that she would never
marry a man who couldn’t pervide her with
an home with a drorin’-room suite in it, so’s
she could sit down and entertain ’er friends.
I saw that there was nothin’ more for me
to do than get work. I was so far gone
on her, I meant to ’ave her even at that.
“I got a job at the nearest town, 60 miles
away, and I toiled till I ’ad £6O. _ I useter
go and see her on Sundays, the train ruunin’
close to the farm. After a time I found she
couldn’t abear snakes. I don’t know why.
Maybe it was born in her. But she couldn t
abear snakes at any price. To cure her of
bein’ so silly, ’er brother and me joined to-
gether to cure her be puttin’ the first snake
we killed on her bed. George killed the first
snake, and he oid what we made up to do.
Next thing I knew was a telegram to ‘Come
at once, girl dying.”’
The solemn-eyed man began to shake all
over again, and the stranger watched him in
sympathetic silence, but at length he asked,
“The fright killed her?”
Still the solemn-eyed man wept. The
stranger looked at the barman as if hesitat-
ing about spending another shilling. At
length he called the officer over, and
motioned him to get the man of sorrows
another drink. Circumstances seemed to
warrant the expenditure.
“You know what I always drink, bred,
said the non-paying customer.
After that he seemed somewhat better.
“I just missed the train, and there wasn’t
one till the next day. I called to the sta-
tion-master: ‘Bring me a special.’ He said,
•It will be £6o.’ It was all the money I
had in the world, and I spent it. When I
reached her she was dead.”
“The snake was alive?”
“No, it was dead all right. George took
care of that before he put it on the bed.”
“Then the mate of the dead snake came
into the room?”
“Yes, and a bit over,” said the bereaved
man. “It brought its friends and relatives,
and their friends and relatives, for a hundred
miles round. The room was full of snakes.
The snake George killed must ’ave been a
king of the snakes, and all the others came
to revenge his death, or to attend the
funeral.”
“You never proposed any more? asked
the stranger, seeing that the solemn man
seemed finished.
“On’y three,” said the man. One went
into a decline, and died the day we should
’ave been married. The next one was run
over be a motor-car ’urryin’ to the church
after stayin’ too long tittivatin’ herself up
for the ceremony, and the last one ’ad a
brick fall on her ’ead from a six-storey
building going up.”
“The girl was going up?”
“No, she was waitin’ on the footpath
underneath. I’d made an appointment to
buy the weddin’ ring, and she was a bit
early.”
“I’d go on trying if I were you,” said the
stranger.
“I dursent,” said the solemn-eyed man in
a hoarse whisper. “It’s not meself I’m
thinkin’ of, but it’s some poor innocent girl
who never did me enny ’arm. Soon as I
smile on a girl she’ll get a ’eadache, or a
pain in the stummick, or something. I’m
fatal to wimmin, I am.”
“Nonsense!”
“Fact. I wouldn’t tell you a lie. Did
yer ever hear of a bloke they calls the
Wanderin’ Jew. Alius has to keep walkin’,
and never rests?”
The stranger nodded his head.
“Well, I’m like him, on’y I’m the Un-
willin’ Bachelor. I’m doomed to live with-
out marryin’.” .
At that moment a big, capable-looking
woman, in a rusty little black bonnet, opened
the door and said “Jim” with an authori-
tative jerk of her head, and then went out
again.
“A neighbor of mine,” said the Unwilling
Bachelor, after a pause. And then, after a
little more thought, he said: “I sp’ose shes
come to tell me there’s a job.”
He rose leisurely to his feet, and took a
short-stemmed briar pipe from his pocket
and started to fill it. Then he struck a
match on the seat of his trousers.
“Ah, work,” he said, waving his pipe in
one hand and the lighted match in the other.
“Work,” he repeated. “Every night when I
goes to bed and says me prayers, I alius
thank ’Eaven that there’s such a thing as
work in the world, and plenty of it. Young
feller, it saves a lot of us from goin’ mad/
Then he threw away the lighted match,
which had burnt his fingers, and struck an-
other, and proceeded to Jigh his pipe.
A boy of fifteen put his head through the
door. ,
“Dad,” he said, mother says to urry.
She can’t be waitin’ all day.”

r l ; HE lies T told my lady
/ Beneath the apple tree,
£ When summer dusks were shady
In young, green Arcady —
The lies I told my lady
Were melody to me.
The harping wings a-flutter
JEolian music prest
From shining leaves in utter,
False harmonies of rest —
Wind-fingers set a-flutter
The warm blood in her breast.
And when the white moon, trying
To climb above the hill,
Lit happy lamps of lying
The truth’s last shades to hill,
My tender soul was trying
To fib more sweetly still.
My falsehoods were in keeping
With all the breezes knew —
The tarradiddles weeping
Wet star tales in the dew —
My falsehoods were in keeping
With life, and time, and you.
The lies 1 told my lady
Beside the false, blue sea,
Beneath her hat-brim shady
In wild, sweet Arcady —
The lies I told my lady
Were melody to me.

MY MAN-EATING WOWSER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Yesterday morning when rose the sun
1 dressed in a hurry and seized my gun;
Then off on a mission of joy 1 set,
A fuii-grown Wowser—
A typical Wowser—
A man-eating Wowser determined to get.
“A long, tfill* beast, in a long, black skin, /§
Armed with a gimlet and wearing a grin; B
Has a very flat hat and a very fat brolly;
Supposed to hate everything pretty or jolly;
Wears spectacles sometimes, and said to frequent /
High cliffs and broad beaches on spying intent”— #
These notes I had made, for I did not at least
Want to end up by shooting the wrong sort of beast.
At the'top of a mountain l paused and pulled.
And wondered if Wowsers were skinned or stuffed;
And 1 thought at last, if I scored that day.
I would have my specimen stuffed with hay;
Or if 1 was lucky anil got a pair.
The skin of one would look well on a chair.
Then 1 searched with my glasses to left and right,
But not one Wowser was there iu sight.

Then li seemed »« me. as I watched the crowd.
That the men were vicious*—the women lout!,
And the bathing dresses a lot too short,
And Huriing. together improper sport;
Then J bitterly wondered how men could bear
To see coarse straifgers at nice girls stare.
These thoughts I harbored in C.oil’s bright sun.
Till 1 heard men shouting, “Look out! THERE'S ONE!”
Without knowing whither. I rose and ran, '
And straight across country th’fe' chase began;
Their cries came down to me on the wind,
And one uu uy heels hung close behind;
He brandished a gamp, as along he flew. .
\nd sooth fairly murmured, Ah-h, I’M with you!’’
“I’m (I—<! if 1 know you!*' The rude words gushed
From my drying threat, as we wildly rushed.
“Don’t KNOW' me; dear brother!’’ exclaimed that elf,
>*Tut. tut, dear friend! W HY, I’M BART OF YOUBSKhF!”
Tlien the Beast drew level as we careered;
He’d a small. Hat hut and a monkey heard,
And I recognised, with a choking groan.
That iiis leering face was my own— : M¥ OWX!
Vestei day even, A% set of- sun, 4 ,

But Something kept pace with me. behind for bound!

A TALE OF WOWSERS.


STRAY RHYMES
A Wider Way.
TALE odors from the byways bring
Their memories unclean
J Of Night’s debaucheries. They
cling—•
(Like driven outcasts, mean —
About the ordered plots, where sing
-Mid pot plants, sooty green,
<Caged minstels of the Town. The Streets
As hungry dragons roar
'Their loud behests. Yet faster beats,
Within its selfish core,
'The Iron Heart that yet depletes
The starved Veins more and more.
'The gongs of greed in mocking, sly,
Insistent echoes call
'To eat their Bread of Toil —or die
Unfilled without his hall
'Of effort, where stark Failures lie—
The weary helots all.
Their strength is rendered for a dole
Of Life and low delights.
Mind-empty, small, and starved of soul,
They blink the larger lights,
While dewless Mornings by them roll,
And o’er them starless Nights.
With cheap Ideals are they fed,
Cheap fare and cheaper dress;
By cheat and charlatan misled ;
And e’er their footsteps press
The beaten paths wherein are wed
111-taste and modern ugliness.
In hollow eyes fierce bale fires glow
Of Hate and Haste. The Fear
Of fangs—that each worn wight doth
know
Lurk near and ever near —
Is with them always as they go
Their weary work-ways year on year.
Frail human flotsam, onward rolled
By surging Destinies,
What bud of Hope in fertile fold
Of Chance shall germ for These?
What full-grown Rose of Love unfold
Its crimson mysteries?
The strong Cave-dweller, by the might
Of muscled arms might feed ;
Win Fire and Shelter from the Night
And all his primal need.
No Child of Progress holds the right
To thus secure his meed.
No narrow-chested heir of all
Man’s long inheritance,
Who doth not to occasion call
The god of Pounds and Pence,
Is more than pauper in the thrall
Of hourly Circumstance.
What endless effort that machines
Like Molochs may be fed!
What abnegation, that the means
Of Waste or War be sped!
What madness with the wide demesnes
Of . God’s good things outspread !
While dappled sky and mottled mead
And radiant birds a-wing,
And Nature’s thousand voices lead
The heart a’wandering ;
While there be deathless words to read
And dauntless songs to sing !
In mockery the constant vaunts
Of Human Progress fall.
Gold still his vulgar presence flaunts
In new-built mansions tall;
The ghost of Better Impulse haunts
A ruined manor-hall.
A drunkenness far worse than Wine,
A Thing of Evil Dreams.
A poet, singing unto Swine,
His highest choric themes,
A Devil on a throne divine
To me more seemly seems,
Than Art a hireling unto Wealth,
Or Science prostitute
To Gold. . .God speed this Commonwealth,
With young steps resolute,
Where Genius will not live by stealth
And Worth be absolute.
God aid this golden land to leave
The narrow paths that stray
To barren realms of Power, where weave
The spinners of a day !
And by that Star’s white light to cleave
A grander, wider way !
VICTORIA.

Bacchanalia.
THE lusty cave-men hold their revels
deep,
Drinking from carven cups of mam-
moth bone,
Where rotted apples a red fever keep,
Brimming in blackened vats of hollow
stone.
The bear-fat lamps stream with a smoky
flare,
And in the flickering shadows far apart,
The red maid, wonderful amid her hair,
Grapples the dragon-slayer to her heart.
The ponderous silent feet upon the floor
Tread a mad measure to a beaten skin;
Red. like the wolf-eyes at the cavern door,
Hag-glances pierce the heavy dark within.
The dancers, fierce with thirst, their limbs
unloose,
And clutching dripping cups of mammoth
bone,
Drain the red fever of the apple juice,
Rotted in blackened vats of hollow stone.

Ballad of Content.
THREE cheers for the chair we sit on,
Three cheers for the joys in reach !
Hurrah for the joke we hit on,
In Joe Cook’s brilliant speech!
The pessimist cries for changes,
For things weird and afar,
Whatever remote and strange is—-
My praise to the Things That Are.
Good luck to our legislation,
And the Will Watt Cabinet!
Give thanks to the British Nation,
Huzza for the National Debt!
Banzai for the cash we borrow,
In the good old Tory way,
I never find cause for sorrow,
For our splendid loans, hooray !
I love the Canberra mountains,
The lakes and the rivers fleet,
The architect’s fancy fountains,
I laugh at the Price of Meat.
Hurrah for our empty spaces,
God-speed to our pioneers!
And for friendly colored races,
Boys, three good British cheers!
Thank God for our homely dwelling,
And a calm, suburban life :
Hurrah for buying and selling,
Three cheers for our lawful wife !
Hip-hip for our motors thrilling,
Good beer, and the Picture Show!
A salute to Boy Scouts drilling,
A cheer for our Stat Quo!
The pessimist’s will so strange is,
1 smile at his foolish plot,
To hurry us on to Changes
Progress, Improvement, Rot!
The kids can battle To-morrow,
To pay our bills of To-day ;
I never find cause for sorrow,
And this is my cheerful lay.
All praise to the Wowser’s queries,
Hats off to the Cocky’s cow !
Hurrah for the Ultra Vires,
Cheer everything here and now!
My heart is filled with elation,
Flow perfect our little star —
Content with the whole creation,
Three cheers for the Things That Are!

The Bard on Critics.
I KNOW a Bard who has the true,
Keen, lyric cry divine;
He thinks I am a Genius, too —
But in another line.
We met upon a recent night,
And we held converse high—•_
The Baird, when he is fit and right,
Talks quite as well as I.
He spoke on many things and much —
He is a brilliant elf,
And has a light, amusing touch,
I have the same myself.
“The Critic, now” —I said, _ and leaned,
Far back: he rose, and hissed
“Don’t name that fossil-hearted fiend—
That Vivisectionist!
“I know the animal too well,
And I have rent the air,
Full often, with the bitter yell—
'Where are his bowels? Where?
“When Genius bares its heart that burns
With noble thoughts and high,
Upon that sight august he turns
A cuttlefish-like eye.
“And when I write a Mccnad March,
In fiery verse and fit,
As stiff and cold as frozen starch
He sits, and judges it.
“What knows he of the lonely heights
Whereon the I’oet’s soul
Communes on still, white, solemn nights
With all the stars that roll?
“What knows he of my contract tough
The very Fates to flout,
And take Creation by the scruff
And shake its music out?
“Oh! I have swept from dawn till dark
The harp Australian,
And this has been his best remark —
‘Well done, my little man.
“It’s up the floor, and down the floor,
The Bard must nimbly tread,
And chase the rat-like metaphor
To earn his board and bed.
“I thought, when I fell out of work,
And took to poetry,
Hard Graft I was about to shirk
And live in luxury.
“But, Lord ! If I could once more choose
I’d sooner carry bricks,
Than woo that Cuttysark, the Muse,
Who is so full of tricks.
“You think you have her caught and bound,
And swear she shall not go—
When, rip ! She leaves you, with a sound
Of tearing calico.
“Oh ! I have suffered much for verse,
And, once upon a time.
I was run over by a hearse
While hunting for a rhyme.”
The Bard he sobbed a hard, dry sob,
That in his throat did break.
Then said—“ Ere I conclude this job
I’ve one remark to make:
“Which is: The Critic, mad or sage,
In vain doth cheer, or rail:
The Bard must lash himself to rage
With his own weary tail.”
So spake the Bard. I shook his hand
With sympathy intense,
Although I could not understand
His jagged virulence.
I have had critics in my day
Who didn’t treat me well:
I bear no grudge—but hope that they
May cinders chew in Hell.
CREEVE ROE.
Little Things.
/N this world that hites and kisses
Rebels, laundresses and kings,
World of countless hits and misses,
ISuch a lot of little things!
Hosts of little things that matter
Crave attention every day —
Raindrops that insistent patter
When one should be making hay ;
Little raxicous strident voices
Crying shame on mirth and joy ;
Little pleasant sins (the choice is
Small), hot little lusts that cloy.
Little women so confiding,
Armed with sheaves of little bills;
Little unsuspected hiding-
Places of life’s little ills;
Little grisly ghosts that taunt us
With the chances we have missed ;
Little perished dreams that haunt us,
Little girls we might have kissed.
Little loves and little sorrows,
Little hopes and little fears,
Little schemes for little morrows, .
Little luck through futile years;
Little hands that tend our guttering,
Little candles flick’ring out,
Little fierce, sad goblins muttering,
Little twinges of the gout.
Little gods and little heavens,
Little faiths that somehow seem
All at sixes and at sevens;
Little hells that glare in dream;
Little sweethearts that deceive us
Faithless minxes, smooth and gay—
Jades that somehow, ere they leave us,
Damn our little souls for aye.
Little lies and little vices,
Little hours of costly sport,
Little toys (at frightful prices),
Little raptures running short:
Little curses flung at random
In the faces of the gods....
Lean black horses stalking tandem,
Little bones ’neath little sods.
In this queer old world that totters
To decay with bawds and kings,
Full of martyrs, fools and i)lotters,
Sots and saints and scamps and rotters,
Crushed by that grim thumb (the Potters),
Ah, the crowd of little things!
MAORILAND.
FRANK MORTON.
To be Perfectly Frank.
YOU ask me why 1 love you?
I really cannot say.
I do not think you faultless
In any sort of way.
I call you “saint” and “angel,”
Well knowing that I lie ;
Of course you’re no more sainted,
In point of fact, than I.
Your figure is not perfect; *
I see its grave defects;
Your nose is short and formless;
Yet neither, dear, affects
The ludicrous devotion
I entertain for you ;
It clings to me regardless
Of what you say or do.
In all our days together
I never heard you speak
One brand-new thought. Your humor
Is lamentably weak.
Yet would I rather listen
To your mild quips and skits
Than to the scintillations
Of regiments of wits.
Your temper is atrocious,
And when it has you down,
You look as unalluring
As any girl in town.
I watch the outburst riven
’Twixt cold dislike and pain ;
It passes. In a moment
I worship you again.
Why do I love you, sweetheart?
I’m hanged if I can tell.
For ev’ry hour of Heaven
You give me two in Hell.
I’d drop you with contumely
Had I the strength of will;
Meanwhile I love and loathe you
And truckle to you still.

Lines on a Difficult Morning.
DREAR as the plaint of some sad dun,
I heard the wind arise,
Cold rain had drowned the faded sun
Out of the wintry skies,
The cobwebs of despair were spun
Across all enterprise,
I did not want to stand, or walk,
To smoke or eat or sleep,
To sit or read or drink or talk,
Or smile or think or weep—-
Life tasted like a piece of chalk
When eaten by a sheep.
Such was the sinful state of things
That dark and sober morn,
Time rolled along on broken springs,
Youth’s feet were all a-corn ;
I was as one who madly flings
Stale beer at dying scorn.
I had a grudge against the moon
For losing hold of night,
The day had wakened up too soon
To work its paltry 'spite;
The pen seemed like a tablespoon
When I sat down to write.
I tried to think of morns of old
When all was warm and fair,
When sunshine filtered tender gold
Down all the Summer air,
And when a spirit blithe and bold
Took pleasure by the hair.
I wished I had that spirit here
To kick about the room,
To hold him by the shining ear
And rub him with a broom,
Or make him eat the souvenir
Of something in a tomb.
I tried to set my thoughts on Hell,
To brood on coals and grid,
To make my fancy dance and yell
On Tophet’s red-hot lid,
To fill my nostrils with the smell
Of devil-basted Yid.
’Twas vain; the flames my fancy saw
Were only painted things,
Each devil had an actor’s jaw,
And flimsy paper wings,
And all the tortured souls were raw,
And dull as soap and strings.
And then you came ; and all the place
Awoke to life anew,
The morn was full of pearly grace,
A sweet light swelled and grew;
For looking on your stolid face
Nothing was dull hut you.

Winter Lights.
WESTWARD are the white snow
mountains;
North and South the wind-swept
plain,
Mistily, the hills to eastward
Loom beyond a veil of rain—
Swaying trees, and wet, wild grasses,
Coldly running, muddy streams.
O’er the shoulder of the mountains
One last flare of sunlight gleams,
Making light a desolation —
So the picture seems to me.
God! I used to love the winter —-
Winter lights upon the sea.
When the pale, great, crested breakers
Thundered in from far beyond,
Where the sullen sea and skylines
Met and made a sullen bond —
Clouds that flew from gales pursuing,
Seas that leaped and foamed and rolled,
Still the winter lights at sunset
Made them living seas of gold—
Golden, green, and jewelled, splendid,
Filled with reckless mystery—
How 1 loved the ruthless winter,
And its lights upon the sea.
See, a steamer takes the challenge,
Pushing out beyond the bar ;
Out to sea when day is fading,
With one pale, lone, masthead star,
Now the sunset, lingering, touching,
Burns on metal, gleams on glass,
Making her a phantom vessel,
Shadowed by the dark smoke-mass;
Night falls soon upon the water,
Rolling darkly, dour and dree,
And the man-lit lamps go swaying,
Dipping, lifting on the sea.
There is gold on snow-clad mountains,
Grey and slow, the clouds of rain
Move from misty hills, half hidden,
Out across the green, wet plain—
Drifting trees and splashing water,
Rippling, draining, busy streams,
Wondrous-colored in the shadows.
Falling from a sky of dreams.
Beauty? Aye. of desolation,
And of death it seems to me —
Yet I loved to watch the winter.
Winter lights upon the sea. '

The Cheap Butcher.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
EARLY closing day at The Merry Widow
Butchery is as the testing in the
crucible.
The hot air, the spirit of haste, the
anxiety lest we miss the “good cuts’’!
• The nearness of “bodies,” “sides,” pyra-
mids of kidneys—the shelf replete with crys-
tallised “corned”! The pressure of hurried
humanity all waiting for meat!
The proprietor is fat, like his own best-
quality joints. He has a treble chin and
legs like a ballet dancer. His shaven lip
grimaces horribly at the meat as he bends it
to his will. His address is a mixture of
familiarity and humility, and even had he
acquired an Australian twang, his manner,
rich in “Thenks!” and “Yuss, mum,” would
proclaim him an importation. Cockneydom
is his birthplace, and his name is Tonks.
Meat, meat —on all sides, meat! Meat
with a natural garniture of flies, for the
establishment has never risen to fly-proof
doors.
Pressed forward by the carnivora round me,
my nose is forced into the frescoed interior
of a “mutton.” I back ou to someone’s
toes, and an elbow, sharp as a poniard, stabs
me in the ribs. Writhing agonisedly away
from this vengeance, I crunch something
under my feet —child or dog, I know not.
All I do know is that for a paltry pound of
“shorts” I have been pommelled about and
mauled for the best part of an hour. The
morning is still young. Two hours yet ere
Mr. Tonks places his shutters between us
and his stock. Yet, till he does so. will
this scarifying pressure continue. Mean-
while, the butchers saw and chop in a frenzy
of business. One, heavy of jowl, swings a
cleaver, and a meek-faced lamb is knocked in
twain. Another dismembers pork like an
assassin.
“ ’Ow much d’ you say?” asks the boss
meat-man of a customer well in the van-
guard.
“Four’n’arf pounse o’ roas,’ ” she cries
shrilly over the sub-current of din. (“Chop,
chop,” interrupts the butcher’s axe, guillo-
tining another mutton.) “Cut lean,” con-
tinues the customer. “He don’ like” (“chop,
chop”) “it fat” (“chop, chop”), “an’ it
goes to waste” (“Put that dog out, Charlie,”
interrupts Mr. Tonks) —“on me,” she fin-
ishes in triumph.
I try in vain to catch the eye of Mr.
Tonks, but ever he glances elsewhere. Things
seem to me chaotic, and the butchers are
blind instruments of chance. Yet there is
some method. Some people are heard ; some
are served, as witness their struggles to the
counter, and the subsequent collection of
their meat from the red-haired belle behind
it.
“ ’Ow much this lot, Charlie?” the charmer
screams amid the conflicting noises, the
sotto voces, and the cries of “Fatty’s
cornin’!”
“Fatty,” a greasy collector of offal, ar-
rives in an evil-smelling vehicle, like a war-
chariot carrying a dead and decomposed
Ahab.
“Two—four—narf,” answers Charlie.
“Two six—change a bob —no sonny, got
other work to do !”
“Sossages?” clamors Mr. Tonks, fever-
ishly. “Yuss, miss—thick er thin?”
“I don’ know—er —perhaps thick ones
would be”
“Yuss, miss!”
“No-ho, after all, I think thin”—she is a
hesitating person. “What would you ad-
vise?”
“Take ’em mixed, Miss, an’ you’ll please
all stummicks,” advises Mr. Tonks, alive to
the value of time. And the damsel, with-
out further option, “takes ’em mixed.”
She has half a mind now to decide for all
thick, but a timid glance at the butcher con-
vinces her that he has w'ashed his hands of
her—cut her off with a sausage. She forces
her dissatisfied way to the open.
My turn. But now that opportunity
knocks at my door, my heart thumns. and my
tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth, so
it is another for whom blood is shed on the
altar of the block, as if Charles I. were
being beheaded afresh. The serving of the
fittest is the laiv here. I am steadily losing
ground—forced back and back until I stare
lethargically into the sly smile of a pig’s
cheek. In the subtle joke which was con-
vulsing the porker when he was stuck I
become a participator. Together we snig-
ger there, in the midst of “Chop, chop ! ’Ow
much, Charlie?”—“Yuss —all fuss-clawss
meat —Tender?”—(he is hurt at the sug-
gestion). “Tender’s chicken, ma’am”—
“Chop, chop !”—“Three, nine, narf !”
A deep bass voice booms in: “Make way
fer ‘Fatty,’ please, ladies!”
The bawling of “Fatty” quite spoils, for
the moment, the even tenor of my jest with
the pig’s cheek. Indeed, the collector of fat
almost annihilates me with a most offensive
bag he carries. It is a bran sack, stiff with
grease, and with cascades of summer-softened
fat bubbling from its gauing mouth.
In giving “Fatty” the freedom of . the city
we suffer. He presses us close, grinning like
a gargoyle, and grunting like a pig as he
goes.
It appears he is a welcome and beloved
visitor to the staff. Even the whiz of the
saw, the chop of the axe, slacken for a mo-
ment as he passes, and the houri behind the
counter affects to covet his filthy, long-
skirted tunic of blue for a surf-bathing out-
fit.
Before he removes his bright presence
from our midst he is presented by the firm
with half a hundredweight of sausages.
With these all escaping from an inadequate
newspaper wrapping he departs, like a Mav
queen wreathed about with daisy chains, and
a palpable gloom falls over the premises.
“I don’ want scraggy meat.” pipes Young
Australia, near the block. “Me old battle-
axe says she wants”
“Yuss, an’ who is yer old battle-axe, me
Billy the blob?” inquires Mr. Tonks, play-
fully.
“Me mother—me ole woman, o’ course.
Don’t yer know English?”
“I knows cheek when I ’ears it. Yu«s. an’
you’re IT. Jus’ sproutin’, you are, like all
the Orstralians —no better, no wuss.”
He looks gloomy, but remembers the good
of the business in time, and is humble and
facetious in the twinkling of an eye.
“Ha, ha!” he chuckles, leering at his
customers; “you can’t lick Orstralians fer
pluck an’ grit—Yuss, yuss. Grit all the
way through—‘me battleaxe!’ firs’ clawss,
that is—good enough for a variety show, ha,
ba! Wot’s fer you, ma’am—sossages?—
Yuss —no, no tripe ; sold out —’ave some
more ’n Monday. Wotto !”
He makes playful sallies with his steel.
“Too late” (“chop, chop!”). “Well, wot
about a tender bit o’ blade now —elf —good
fer old teeth —ha, ha! Yuss, wimmen an’
’osses, all’ys tell ’em by their teeth! Any-
thing helse?”
“’Ow much?”
“Four narf, fer th’ lady”

pagne? Ver' well! I docka da price, nine-
pence, offa your waga.”
Just here I see my cobber, the pig’s cheek,
borne away to execution. Through his
fringed eyelids he gives me a last gleam of
gaiety as he swings in the scales. Then his
snout is severed with the axe, and I see him
no more.
There is nothing left to hobnob with now
but a sheep’s head. I look into its hollow
eyes. A w T ise old face and gentle—surmount-
ing a pyramid of his relation’s craniums he
mutely preaches on the vanity of living.
Varied are the expressions of his descend-
ants. Among them is the gay young mutton,
once a sheep of brilliant narts, but saddish
now, alas, and with but a poor opinion of
the situation. The wiseacre sheep is there,
and the fool sheep, and the - black sheep,
and the 99th sheep that was lost in the
wilderness and lacked the sense to stay there.
Also, I think I recognise the scapegoat,
and the camel that couldn’t go through the
needle’s eye.
While herding patiently with these a blast
and a scrunch announce a motor. The
motorist springs out and into the shop.
Measles has broken out among the human
wilderness of the butcher’s twins, and this is
the doctor.
With considerable authority he forces a
way through the serried ranks of US. He
sniffs the air in a technical way, looks fret-
fully at the flies, and demands Hygiene.
“Goo’ day, sir,” chirrups Tonks cheer-
fully, as one who grovels to his betters,
“Goo’ day !”
“Day!”
“Fine day, sir. Yuss, sir. ’Arriet” —he
calls to his wife through an open door, and
the door is presently tilled by Mr. Tonks’s
counterpart in petticoats—a dame of ISst.
or so. Over her arm hangs a Tonks junior.
“ ’Arriet, the doctor’s here. Don’ kip ’im
waitin’. ’ls time is waluable.”
’Arriet makes way. The medico picks his
road infand circumspectly. He has a con-
stitutional horror of meat in the raw. Per-
haps this is why Fate decrees that he shall
get a spattering of gore from Charley’s
cleaver is he passes. Shuddering testily, he
plunges in to where the twins are.
An ancient fisherman, encrusted with
scales and shining like Lohengrin, comes in
among us. He smells so badly of stale
oysters as to get instant attention from the
staff. The cash girl of the red locks advises
him to take a bath, giving him at the same
time the address of her scent merchant.
“You can’t come surfing with me, Bob,
unless you’re sweeter smellin’,” she says
coyly. “All the boys at Coogee would give
me the cut —they would for a cert. They’re
all select. Look out, you old goat, don’t
come too near! ’Ere’s your meat. Git!”
He “gits,” leaving a whiff of old ocean
behind.
Hardly has he gone when a boy tumbles
in, holding out the fisherman’s purchase.
“That ole Dutch clock wot got these chops
—yes, ’im that sells fish,” he explains to
Tonks; “ole Barracouta Bob —-’e says these
chops is food fer dogs. ’E won’t have ’em
at no price. Give ’im back his gilt, ’e says,
an’ kip ther meat for sossages”
“Yuss, a likely yarn! Tell Barracouta
Bob that these chops is jest as fresh as ’is
iysters, an’ a deal fresher than be smells.
An’ get oudt”
“ ’Ow much, Charlie?” (“Chop, chop!”)
“ ’lnd, did you say, madam? No ’inds
left —all gorne. A leg of ’am now?”
He sniffs and makes grimaces at his stock
of loins.
“Plow’d a forketter do? Look out with
that chopper, Charlie! ’Ere’s the doctor
cornin’ hout.” He fawns. “Well, sir,
how’s the twins, sir?” Bit spotty, I
should think —eh —ha, ha —like the leo-pard
—ha, ha, ha! But you can change their
spots—-the animile’s cahnt. A good joke,
sir, ain’t it. Yuss, thenks—never better”
(in reference to his business). “Anything
helse? Goo’ day, sir! Thenk you, sir.”
“Day!”
The doctor steps out, and feels vaguely
in his pockets as though in search of a disin-
fectant. He contents himself bv brushing
his clothing with his handkerchief, and
brushing away the butcher’s jokes and his
sawdust simultaneously. Then, “Burr-r-r-
-choot-choot-chut.” Petrol, dust and the man
of medicine is gone.
“An’ now, Miss, wot can I get fer you?”
Can it be me who is addressed? Gasping
I rise to the honor.
“A pound of veal cutlets,” I say.
“Sold out o’ weal, Miss! No, no rump
neither. Now wot’s the use o’ askin’ for
trine at this hower?—you should a-come
earlier. It’s only the early wumman ketches
the lamb cutlets in this shop, Miss. Charlie,
any sweetbreads? No, miss, you re too late.
You’ve missed the B-U-S. How d a couple
o’ poun’ o’ rib chops do now ?—-yuss—-jus as
good as lamb or any o’ these fancy things .
“’Ow much. Charlie?”
“Take ninepence fer the lady, Mr. Tonks.
And I depart with plain mutton —the last
wreck of the day’s business.

Echoes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BROTHERS!.... .
(That is to say, those of you that
are.
For, even in the most altruistic mood, there
are some I bar.)
Brothers!
Workers, shirkers, writers, skiters, philo-
sophers and others,
Attend. I address myself only to those
Of the class that habitually looketh even
beyond its nose.
To him I speak who shrewdly seeketh for
the milk in the cocoanut, while his
fellows are repeating the bald assertion
that “The fruit is not yet ripe!”
Him I address who knoweth the sheep from
the goats, the chaff from the oats, the
half-quid from the gilded sixpence, and
the common sense from common tripe.
To the “Man in the fetreet” I speak not, nor
to the “Right-thinking Person,” nor
“Constant Subscriber,” nor “Vox Popu-
li,” nor “The Bloke on the Train,” nor
any of their band.
For of the things I write they wot not,
neither may they hope to understand.
But ye whom I, even I, presume to address
as brothers: —-
Journalists, politicians, burglars, company
promoters, miners, millers, navvies,
shearers, confidence-men, piano-tuners,
paling-splitters, bookmakers, process-
workers, judges, brass-finishers, police-
men and others,
Attend. Him who looketh for the hall-mark
on every link, and taketh not the say-so
of the label, nor the sworn affidavit of
th. pill who hath it
in him to discern the fair thing from
that which is over the odds, and shaketh
the new-laid egg that he may know what
is within it —
Him I address. For 10, my brothers, maybe
there is one of us born once a week or
thereabouts, but we know it is written
that one of the others is born every
minute.
Wherefore attend.
And lend
An ear; for I have planned for you a pleas-
ing diversion.
Come with me, my brothers, and let us make
a little excursion
Out over the land, through the cities and the
country places, even to the farthest
limit of Back-o’-beyond. Hearken bro-
thers ! What are these sounds we hear?
Say, what is all this babbling and gabbling,
this howling and growling, this mut-
tering and spluttering, that smites the
ear?
Listen again. Do you hear them, brothers?
Lo, they are the Echoes calling.
They are the multitudinous echoes that
sound up and down the land; crying
and sighing, squalling and bawling.
In all places they sound ; in the city and in
the country; upon the high mountains
and along the plains, wherever man
hideth : and at all times, for the night
is loud with the sound of them even as
is the day.
Listen again, brothers! What is it that
they say?
Lo, this one shouteth, “ The Time is Not Yet
Ripe!" And another bawleth, “ Capital
is fleeing the Land!” And yet another
howleth, “It is Inimical to Private En-
terprise and Thrift!” And yet another
screameth, “It will Bust up the Home
and Ruin the Marriage Tie!”
Why do they howl these things, my bro-
thers? I,ask ye, why?
For 10, even as they shout, still other Echoes
take up the cry till it is increased and
multiplied even unto 70,000 times
seven ;
And a howl, as of 1400 she-elephants simul-
THE COMMON FATE.
FIRST OLD MAID: “Did you hear Ethel was
married?"
SECOND DO. (sighing) : “Oh, well, I s'pose it's
what we'll all have to come to."
taneously robbed of their young, assail-
eth Heaven.
What say ye, brothers? What is the inner
significance of these Echoes, and why do
they make these divers sounds? What
say ye, brothers; is it because they
think?
Aha! I apprehend ye! I saw ye—nay,
verily, I heard ye wink,
For the noise of the falling—of the flapping
of your collective eyelid was even as
the banging of the bar door what time
the clock telleth of eleven thirty p.m.,
and the voice of Hebe murmureth
through the night, “Good-lye, duchy."
. . . .But I digress.
Which is a characteristic failing I must
confess;
But, nevertheless,
It hath its compensations, as is plain to any
noodle,
When matter is paid for at space rates, for
it pileth up the b00d1e....
However, to resume. Let us isolate a case,
my brothers. Let us sample an Echo.
Take Brown.
We all are well acquainted with Brown.
Mayhap his name is Smith or Timmins,
but no matter. He is the Man in the
Street. He hath a domicile in the
suburbs and an occupation in town.
This Brown riseth in the morning and don-
neth the garments of civilisation. In
hot socks he garbeth his feet, and upon
his back he putteth a coat which hath a
little snlit in the tail for no sane or ac-
countable reason,
Except that it is an echo of the first and
original split that set the fashion for
the season.
Then he proceedeth to feed,
And simultaneously to read
His solemn, though occasionally hysterical,
morning sheet, which he proppetli
against the cruet,
Remarking to his spouse, inter alia, “I wish
to goodness, Mirabel, you wouldn’t cook
these things with so much suet!”
(Which rhyme, though labored, is remark-
ably ingenious and very rare. For you
will find, if you try to get a rhyme for
cruet But let that pass. This is
more digression.
Time is money; but the space writer must
contrive to sneak it with discretion.)
Lo! as Brown peruseth his paper a lugu-
brious voice speaketh to him from out
the type,
Saying: “ Despite the howls of demagogues
and the ranting of pseudo-reformers, it
is patent to any close student of politi-
cal economy — nay, it is obvious even to
the Man in the Street that the Time
is Not Yet Ripe”
And Brown, with solemn gravity,
Having mainly a cavity
In that part of him where good grey matter
should abide,
Pusheth the sheet aside,
And sayeth to the wife of his bosom across
the breakfast dish of stewed tripe:
“ Verily, this paper speaketh fair. The time
is not yet ripe!"
Now, mark ye, brothers, it is the nature of
a cavity to give back that which is
spoken into it. This doth it repeat.
Wherefore Brown, with rising heat,
Sayeth again: “ Dammit, woman, this Labor
Party will ruin the blanky country. Of
course, the time is not yet ripe!
Where’s my pipe?
And my umbrella and my goloshes? I’ll
miss that train again as sure as eggs!”
Then on nimble legs
He hasteth to the train,
And here again
He meeteth other Echoes surnamed White
or Green or Black,
Each with a coat upon his back
Which hath an absurd and altogether un-
necessary little split in its tail.
Brothers, do not let the moral fail.
For it is written:
If the tail of the coat of Brown be absurdly
split,
So, also, shall the tails of the coats of White
also Green and Black be likewise split-
ten ;
And if the mind of Brown with a shibboleth
be smit,
So, also, shall the alleged minds of White
and Green and Black be smitten.
For, 10, they use but as hat-racks those
knobs or protuberances which Nature
has given unto them to think with;
and, even as 10,000 others of their
type,
They echo again, as the train speedeth on-
ward, the same weird cry: Lo, the Cost
of Living is becoming a Fair Cow!
These Trusts will have to be Outed.
Biot, as the paper says, the Referendum
is a dangerous mistake. The Time is
Not Yet Ripe !!”
And here and there, and elsewhere, and in
divers places, not mentioned in the
specifications, the foolish Echo echoeth
. and re-echoeth and echoeth even yet
again, till it soundeth far and near and
in the middle distance from Dan to
Beersheba. Ay, even from Yarra Bend
to Kow Plains ;
In hundreds of trams and boats and trains;
In motor-cars and .linkers and spring-carts
and perambulators and hearses and
Black Marias; in shops and pubs
and offices and cow-yards and gaols
and drawing-rooms and paddocks
and street corners ; and across coun-
ters and slip-rails and three-wire
fences, and streets and lanes and
back fences ; and through telephones
and speaking-tubes and pipestems
and weird whiskers of every shade
and color; up and down the land,
and across it; from the mouths of men
of every shape and size and kind and
type,
The Echo soundeth and resoundeth : “The
TIME IS NOT YET RIPE —RIPE — ripe —
ripe ”....
And now the Voice —the original, anonymous
voice that caused these divers Echoes —
smileth to Itself and saith: “ Verily ,
that was a good gag. It should help to
hump ’em next elections. This unpre-
cedented growth of Public Opinion is
prime. ...
Snaggers, see if vou can get a column inter-
view with Sir Ponsonby Stodge on the
Obvious Unripeness of Time.
We must follow this un while we’re in Inch.”
And the voice of the Chief Reporter answer-
ing, saith : “ Ribuck.”
Brothers, ye have heard the Echoes. In a
. multitude of words have I spoken of
them to ye. Have I not planned for ye
a pleasing diversion? Lo! then, when
the little Blue Devil sitteth upon the
right shoulder and whisnereth info the
ear that the World is a Dead Nark;
when the Spice of Life tasteth in the
mouth even as the stale beer of yester's
revel; when the Soul wilteth for lack
of congenial employment;
Go ye forth and give ear unto the Echoes,
and thus shall the Snirit be unlifted and
cheered by the faDieadedness of your
fellows, and ye shall reap profitable and
unending enjoyment.
I say this unto ye, even I, and my word has
never been broken
More often than has been absolutely neces-
sary or ovnedient considering the dread-
ful Socialistic trend of Legislation in
this Country. Lo! I have spoken.
VICTORIA.

Dropped.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
After further discussion the matter was allowed
to drop.— Daily paper.
Bang :
Wallop!!
Thud ! !!
Did you hear it strike the mud?
'Twas the matter, falling flatter—hear the
monstrous biff and clatter as it trundles
down the stairs;
Hear the rumble, crash and tumble —’tis the
heavy hoof of Bumble falling over our
affairs!
He’s a miracle, this party—
He is very stout and hearty—
With the habit, sir, of dropping—
Hear th.e weighty questions flopping—
With the Pose Procraslinative
Lo, our Bumble Legislative
Drops such ouestions and affairs!
Biff!
Clatter! !
Bash !! !
Did you hear the dreadful crash?
That was Bumble —-Oh, be humble, for it is
not wise to grumble, and bad tactics to
complain ;
To Perdition Inanition sends each question
—ils position Bumble mentions with dis-
dain !
He’s a wonder, that’s admitted,
And is quite entirely fitted
For the pleasant task of dropping
Things that you and I want stopping—
Oh ! our Bumble, State and local,
Doth indeed impress the yokel
With his gesture of disdain.
Crash!
Wallop !!
Biff!!!
Sounded like a falling cliff!
’Twas some question or suggestion giving
Bumble indigestion, so he dropped it
then and there;
If his brain, sir, stood the strain, sir, it
would be a cause of pain, sir, to his
Majesty the Mayor!
He’s a genius, no one it—
Yes, the welkin simply shouts it,
And I’ll tell you, confidential,
That he KNOWS he is essential
But his brains, alas, are weary,
So address no awkward query
To his Bumbleship the Mayor.
Bash!
Clatter! !
Whiz ! ! !
Thus our Bumble settles Biz!
Hear his blather —you may gather, ’tis the
learned City Father dropping things
with childish glee.
Does he reason? Hist! That’s treason —-for
our lordly Mayor is wheezin’ on behalf
of You and Me!
He’s our Dropper—aye, our jewel
Who sustains our pride with fuel;
All the world seems bright and sunny
As we watch him wasting money—
Yea, our earnest mien relaxes
When wastes the rates and taxes
Which are paid by You and Me!
Thud!
Wallop ! !
Bang!! !
There’s a glad and careless gang!
So each Matter falleth flatter, and we give
them gold to scatter as they bargain and
co-opt;
Hail to Bumble! Oh, be humble—on your
knees I pray you tumble, let your hat be
swiftly dropped !
Tie’s a wonder, is this party,
Co I say with language hearty
That the habit, sir , of Dropping
Calls with emphasis for stopping.
And I beg to move that Bumble
Re allowed HIMRELF to tumble —
For it’s time that he was DROPPED !

AN AMATEUR IN PHILANTHROPY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was an off hour in Mackaboy’s bar. A
droning fly was persistently cracking his
unwise head against the imitation oak
ceiling. The wool-buyer, on a canted chair,
his back to the wall, his heels on a small,
marble-topped table, and a cocktail between
them for justification, was purring tenderly
in his sleep. Long, down on his elbows, his
hands raking his hair, yawned cavernously
over a half-pint of shandy. The barman,
quite depressed, practised sleight-of-hand
tricks with a stale biscuit.
A sallow street cripple of 10, his face
dappled with freckles, butted between the
folding doors, and emitted a life-like imita-
tion of the bleating of a calf. The party
woke up. The boy supplied some further
barnyard imitations, and gave a realistic
counterfeit of a dog fight.
“Gimme a tanner, ’n’ I’ll do the hoppies’
’ornpipe,” said he. He began to dance on
his crutch.
Long threw the cripple a penny. “Get
•out,” he said; “you’re keeping the barman
up.”
The wool-buyer tossed another copper, and
the artist retired.
“Nothing I detest more than ostentatious
charity,” mused the barman.
“You go smother yourself in your own bad
beer,” Long retorted with pointed bitterness.
“Dunno that I don’t regard charity of any
sort, open air or sub-rosa, as a dangerous in-
dulgence.”
“Listen to him, Winterton. and every lug-
biter in the country nibbles his ear. There
isn’t a beat or a beer-sparrer for miles
■around who doesn’t know that Mackaboy is
good for contributions, cash or kind, when
■everything else fails.”
Patrick Mackaboy continued his gentle
moralising. , “And I dunno that it isn’t more
cursed to give than to receive. There was
Catanach. You don’t know Catanach, He
served his purpose on earth by illustrating
the fact that a man, in indulging his sym-
pathies, may be putting a match to a little
hell of his own.
“Catanach was cultivating his undoubted
talents when events began to happen.
Prompted by sundry tine ideas, he was bent
upon doing something worthy of himself.
Hitherto he had been a desultory sort of
young blackguard, taking on what was easiest
and handiest, wasting a decent education, an
able head and a cunning hand on vagabond-
crafts, acting as racecourse amanuensis to a
bull-throated Jew, Johnnie All-sorts with a
brigand band of theatricals, head accountant
and floor-walker in a billiard saloon, and
generally consorting with prodigals.
“Now he was determinedly and persistently
different, had a steady billet of a reputable
sort, was poking his nose into decent homes,
and cultivating one particular talent with
the intention of satisfying a certain person
that confidence reposed in him was not mis-
placed. He had a vainglorious desire to get
up top somewhere, and with it all went a
great glow of goodwill to men.
“This Catanach had a room up a straight,
stiff stair in an old building in a city side
street, where he did himself proud with a
kerosene stove, a collapsible, chain-mail bed,
and a library of 14 volumes in a sawed-off
gin case. Several others lived in that old
stone home, all persons of furtive habits,
who never opened their doors very wide, and
shut them immediately on entering. One was
a black-and-white artist. Another was a
great minor poet. The rest were impover-
ished also, with an exception perhaps. The
exception was 24, thin, tallish, dark and
THE DRAMA.
The ruthless villain, Sir Rupert Vavasour, now thoroughly unmasked, throws all conceal-
ment to the winds, and, drawing a knife, plunges it to the hilt in Johann’s hack.
Then, springing like a bloodhound on the defenceless Lady Florizel, he seizes
her by the throat, at the same moment felling Algernon, Herbert, Clarence and
her uncle Benjamin in four fell blows. For the moment all seems indeed lost,

colorless immediately after washing. She
had an infrequent Bd. to spare for ginger ale.
Samuel heard it popping.
“Occasionally S. Catanach met the excep-
tion on the stairs, when she assumed a speak-
to-me-at-your-peril expression, and hastened
her steps, with the exaggerated alarm of a
maiden lady whose reputation was at stake.
But Samuel had been observing things, and
drawing conclusions in spare moments. He
was not deceived. The lady’s business hours
were from 8 p.m. onward, her boots were
always jaded, and she had something of the
air of a waiter, something of the manner of
the man who lounges on corners, wanting to
sell a cage of pups.
“Catanach was sorry for the girl. He
had a great capacity for compassion just
then. He could grieve over sore dogs, and be
sympathetic towards the old tramp with the
sacking overalls and feet like puff-balls, who
collected cigar butts and orange peel in the
streets, and was dead and didn’t know it.
He had it in his mind to speak to her, offer-
ing advice and consolation. She looked as if
she needed both, but obviouslv she was hav-
ing none of his. She ducked and side-stepped
when he drew near, half terrified, half resent-
ful.
“One night Sammy was pushing a large
umbrella through the city drizzle, when a
tallish, slim, damp female stepped from a
warehouse doorway, and embraced his arm.
“ ‘How do, Willie?’ she said. ‘Be a sport.’
“Sammy lowered his gamp and the girl
retreated into the doorway with a cry. but
Catanach had seen her face. He retained his
grip.
“ ‘I say, old girl.’ he said, ‘this is a rotten
night for a sick woman to be gadding.’
The ring of commiseration in Catanach’s
voice did the mischief. Lulu simply col-
lapsed. She went down on the steps in a
limp heap, her forehead on her knees, her
hands lying beside her, and, ‘Oh! oh! oh!’
said she.
“It was worse than crying. It meant
utter exhaustion of body and spirit after a
long hard fight and misery past tears.
“Sam whistled up a hansom, helped the
girl in, and nothing was said during the
drive. Pie hoisted her up the stairs and into
her room, placed her on the bed, removed the
jaded boots, the depressed hat, and a damp
macintosh, and then, diagosipg the case as
influenza, aggravated by impecuniosity and
general depression, cooked some liberal
treatment with the aid of methylated spirits
and her own stove.
“ ‘What’s your name?’ he said.
“ ‘Lulu—Lulu Belleuse.’
“ ‘No nom de guerre. This is not a pro-
fessional call. Reckon we’ve had a neigh-
borly, over-the-fence acquaintance these three
months.’
“ 'Elizabeth Smith.’
“‘Ha! That’s nearer home. Can you
drink hot milk, Lizzie?’
“tie gave her the hot milk. Next morning
he looked in early, with a bowl of soup.
“ ‘I was once an in-patient in a gaol hospi-
tal, and this is what they give you when they
get you down. It’s cruelty to animals, but
have a go at it.’
“She had spoken just four words to him
since he carried her home, and now she
turned to the wall and cried. Sam sat on
the bed edge, and pulled her face to him. It
was white and thin, and sodden with tears.
It had never been pretty, but Sam didn’t
dislike it.
“ ‘Come, come,’ he said in a motherly way.
‘it’s going to be all right. There’s no call
for fireworks and general rejoicing, I know,
but don’t let go. Is there anyone I can call
up?’
“ ‘No one.’
“‘No sister, or chum?’
“ ‘No one,’ she repeated almost fiercely—
‘no one anywhere. You mustn’t think of
it.’
“ ‘Oh, very well. We’ll manage. Give
this whitewash a fair trial. It’s my first
offence.’
“It was Sunday, and he returned to her an
hour later. She was dry-eyed and brighter.
“ ‘Hello, hello!’ he cried. He sat by her
side, and laughed jubilantly. ‘You begin to
think life’s worth living.’ He was really
enthusiastic. He had the rapture that comes
of beneficence. Not the beneficence of the
pocket but of the heart.
“ ‘You’re a damned good fellow!’ she said.
“ ‘Well, I began to suspect myself. I
never had the symptoms before, but there’s
a sort of holy seepage at work within.’
“ "You’re one of the best. G— —’ (She
stumbled at the word). ‘God bless you!’
“ ‘How would I go in a Wowser outfit of
Sabbatical black, with a bloated umbrella,
and an affecting habit of praying in my
hat?’
“She didn’t smile. ‘I knew you were
clean and decent,’ she said. ‘That’s why I
turned you off. I —l wanted you to think
me square.’
“ ‘Elizabeth Smith,’ said Catanach,
severely, ‘you’re out of your class. Lulu
Belleuse is an error of judgment. You’re
not built for it. The game, like most other
games, needs a special gift. You mistook
your call—-that’s all. You haven’t the pecu-
liar talent. Lots of girls make the same
mistake, only to find they haven’t a taste
for primroses, or any real Bohemian in-
stincts. Well, get out.’
“ ‘That’s easily said. You’re right, though.
Lulu Belleuse is a frost. I haven’t the
natural aptitude.’
“ ‘Then pass Lulu —a valedictory for Bel-
leuse. Lizzie Smith redivivus! See here, I
know a neat little convalescents’ home by
the gum trees and the sea where for four
quid you could have a fortnight’s complete
rest, with repairs thrown in. It’ll set vou
up. Jump in.’
T , “ ‘F°V r . quid ! 1 haven’t four shillings.
I m broke.
“ ‘lt’s my shout.’
‘‘‘And when I come out?’
I can t say its a dead cert, but I know
where there’s a billet for a decent girl of
about your height and complexion, in cir-
cumstances that would make the simple life
not altogether intolerable.’
, . “The girl sat up, and gripped his elbows.
And why, why? Why should you do this
tor me. I lnlanthropy isn’t your business,
is it?’
“ ‘Well, no, I’m not working at it. I’m
n .°t , a - ® o( hal Purity Brigade, ido this for
the kid s reason—because.’
‘‘ ‘You would be called a fool.’
.“.‘Of course, but I’m not courting public
criticism. However, there is a sort of
reason, old girl. I’ve got a gift of gladness.
i world s suddenly turned kind. Fate
and b ortune have adopted me, and I feel so
u a mned good I could hug a post.’
Elizabeth Smith went to the convales-
cents home. She came out looking like the
n f w season’s goods, fresh and well, and Sam
placed her with a friend who was a dentist,
and who paid £1 2s. fid. a week for a lady-
like person to open liis door, change the
flowers in his vases, and hold down such of
his victims as showed a disposition to
scratch and gouge in holts. She wore a
prim, blue uniform, with white cap and
apron, and looked quite aggressively respect-
able. Elizabeth bucked up amazingly. She
dropped ten years in about as many days.
She had a bright eye, a spring bloom, and
within two weeks of her return to the
straight and narrow way Sam heard her
trilling samples of comic opera in her room,
ihe room put on airs, too. It was as trim
and cool as an enamelled ice-cream van. It
had pictures on the walls, and a smart bed-
cover overgrown with blue roses. Eliza-
aetfl’._with the aid of a chafing dish
and 4o square inches of rump steak, proved
to Catanach’s _ complete satisfaction that
the age of miracles had not
passed. Society wa« opening
its arms to Miss Smith. The
consumptive typewriter girl in
the dingy room under the
stair permitted her to be kind.
The reformation was a com-
plete success. Now and then
Sammy sort of spread it out
in his room, and looked at it
with the rapture of a young
artist contemplating his mas-
terpiece.
“One night, returning home
so full of pure bliss that the
bubbling process was simply
ungovernable, Catanach looked
in, and bubbled to Elizabeth,
who was busy putting some
1902 touches on a hat of the
vintage of 1900.
“ ‘Don’t encourage me,’ he
said. ‘lf you do, look out for
the deluge. I’m like a bottle
of champagne pushing its
cork.’
“She smiled at him like an
indulgent aunt. ‘Well, what
is it this time?’
‘ “That glad glow of mine.
It’s up at lOOdeg. in the shade.
The fact is, Liz’beth, I’m to
be married in Parson Cam-
eron’s church at three o’clock
on Tuesday fortnight, in de-
fiance of wind, weather and all
the slings of outrageous for-
tune. Nothing can stop me—
nothing, nothing! I am
going to marry the sun,
and the moon, and the
song of birds, laughter, and
music, and gentleness, and joy.
Eliz’beth, I’m the happiest
fool among all the happy fools
who have tasted of the waters
of life and found them to be
wine.’
“She held the hat in her two hands
straight before her, turned it from side to
side, looking at it critically.
“ ‘I offer you my warmest congratulations,’
she said.
“When he left she was still holding the
hat, turning it from side to side. After he
had gone she continued to hold the hat, but
presently her white hands tightened on it,
twisted it, tore it to fragments. She went
to work and tore the pictures from her walls,
quietly, in a sort of frenzy of silence. She
tore the bed-cover, she broke anything that
could be broken without noise. And then
she stole down the stairs, and into the
street. After midnight Lulu Belleuse was
arrested for drunkenness and disorderly con-
duct.
“Catanach saw no more of Elizabeth
Smith for several days. His joy on his wed-
ding day was tempered with apprehension
concerning her. He stood with the smiling
girl who was to be his wife, he held her
hand, and the clergyman gabbled the service.
“ ‘Take this woman’
“It went no further. A shriek from the
back of the church stopped the proceedings.
The people ran to one of the pews, and then
a sickening sort of awe fell upon the place.
A woman had taken poison in the holy pre-
mises. She was dying.
“Catanach pushed through the people and
saw her lying in the aisle —Elizabeth Smith,
alias Lulu Belleuse. She had taken a
copious draught of cyanide of potassium, a
drug that then enjoyed a large vogue. Site
died. The wedding was postponed. At the
inquest Catanach told the truth, so far as
he knew it, and afterwards the girl he loved
said .there was to be no wedding. She said
he had killed Lulu Belleuse. Like most
others, she believed he had been the lover of
the dead girl.
“ ‘You have ruined one woman; be con-
tent,’ he was told when he attempted to ex-
plain.
“Samuel Catanach took his good resolu-
tions out into the street, and kicked them.
He kicked them through the town. Before
midnight he had kicked them into many
strange places. The anti-climax was ss. for
drunkenness, 21s. for disorderly conduct,
40s. for mischief done to the uniform of the
arresting constable.”
There was a pause. Long, leaning on the
counter, looked the barman in the eye. “And
so you never married, Mackaboy?”
Patrick Mackaboy coldly returned Long’s
gaze. “Mister Long, you can go to Hell!”
he said.

My Ship of Dreams.
WHEN little breezes shiver
And eve is red with flame,
I’ll find the magic river,
The stream without a name,
And we two in my elfin boat
Into the sunset’s heart will float.
We’ll take a fine full lading
Of pleasant cakes and ale,
Lest, when the light is fading,
Your manly heart should fail;
For truest poets all have said
That six-foot lovers must be fed.
Then while our sail is filling
With wind-blown, amber light,
And trees and rocks are spilling
Red fire to left and right,
To Mrs. Grundy shall we blow
A farewell kiss before w'e go.
We’ll need no light to guide us
Except your big cigar.
The growing night will hide us
From all but eve’s lone star;
And she, as all men are aware,
Is kind to lovers everywhere.
But you must keep us steady
As penguins on the ice,
Because the boat is ready
To drown us in a trice;
If you should dare to move about,
My fairy craft would tip you out.
The corks would draw as lightly
As Wowsers draw a tear,
To mark the swift and sprightly
Brown influence of beer;
I know the vessel will not sink
Merely because you have a drink.
Then you may sit before me
And tell me all your heart —
A tale that need not bore me
If told with skill and art;
And I shall steer our ship of dream
Adown the ripples of the stream.
Your eloquence enthralling
Shall hold me for a while.
What time the dews are falling
Upon my maiden smile;
And when your raptures pass away
I shall have something left to say.
For I shall tell you simply
A lot of useful things,
The while the stream with dimply
Long wavelets round us sings,
And you must try to keep awake
The whole night long, for love’s sweet sake.
Then while in deep conjecture
You listen to my tale,
I shall conclude my lecture
With looks distraught and pale,
And gazing wetly in your eye,
Ask you in warm, sweet sorrow —-“Why?”
And we shall catch the flowing
Of the strong seaward tide,
And find it easy going
Against the dawn to glide
Right to the place where gladness tells
Someone to jangle wedding-bells.
You shall not keep me waiting,
For I have waited long.
The time of merry mating
And kind, domestic song
Is scheduled when my ship of dream
Floats to the church-door down the stream.
When little breezes shiver.
And dawn has flushed the sky,
We’ll leave the magic river
And bid our dreams good-bye,
And in some nice, suburban street
You’ll learn to sleep, and smoke, and eat.

Weeds.
THE Fairies are out in the fields to-day—
Afar by the weed-grown wold,
Oh! they reel and toss in a drunken
.way,
A-swinging their caps of gold.
For they’ve drunk full deep of the sunlight’s
wine—
To the lilt of a lark’s sweet pain;
And they’ve folded the frills on their little
green frocks,
And washed in the Moon’s white rain.
The thistle bends in his tattered green
By the bracken’s waving stems,
And the ripples over the water pools
Have stolen the Sun King’s gems.
Curtain and curtain of beaded gold,
White butterfly wings emboss.
The fairies are Aiming their caps about,
Where the dandelions toss.
Oh! the fairies are here in the fields to-day—
And out to the Earth’s wide ri™
Thev are singing yet, but we turn awav
Till the sound of their song grows dim.
And grovel and grope for Life, for Love,
In fens that the Darkness breeds.
While the calm lamps shine of the Light
Divine
To the lilt of the wind blown weeds.
VICTORIA.

BEG pardon? Yes, dear, very nice;
But not real walnut, only stained —
Though good enough a suite! The
price?
Oh, I forget now! What’s it matter?
.... And ever through the young wife's
chatter
A memory sweeter, stronger pained
My heart, and made me madder-brained
With thought of her —her pleading eyes
And lips delicious full and red
That I had tasted. . . .
... .Yes, the bed
Will come to-morrow !. ...
.. . .And her head
Leaned proudly on my shoulder there,
My arm beneath her neck, and all her hair
Strewing the pillow with its glossy black.
While errant wisps played tickling on my
face,
With idle, soft persistence. . ..
.... Will I tack
The carpet where the door swings? This
the place?
Right! Pass the hammer !.. .. See, that’s
better now.
The door swings clear !... .
.. . .And on her brow
So happy, white, unruffled.. .how my lips
Strayed to it, pressing fondly kiss on kiss,
And made a smile of full, contented bliss
Ripple the corners of her mouth. The lids
Closed in their blue-veined beauty o'er the
eyes
That yearned and burned beneath them ....
What, the flies
Will speck the new wallpapers! Never mind,
The summer’s nearly over. Until then
Some Tanglefoot we’ll find.
Keep them in check! Yes, dear; of course,
the kids
Must eat their pieces in the kitchen! When
Will Spring be here again? New curtains!
Well, we’ll see—
But Spring, I think, has passed for you and
me!
I’m silly! P’r’aps I am, dear; p’r’ans I am !
But never mind—l’ll polish up these pic-
tures for y0u....
DAME!!!
. . . .0 nothing, dear —a little worried, may-
be! Office? Yes!
And as she lies beside me, how I feel
Her heart beat as my idle hands caress
The hair that clouds her rounded loveliness.
Then sighs perplex our sweetness, and she
slips
Her little hand in mine, lifts up her lips
That I may press upon them the hot seal —
Love's fondly foolish token
....What’s that, dear?
I’m dreaming? Dreaming, was I? I declare
I really was—"-how stupid of me! Come
then, dear, .
I’ll fix the room up for you. Give a hand
To hang the pictures, do just as you will—
I’ve office worries you don’t understand !
No, only trifles —all will come quite right.
What! You won’t kiss me! Ah, that’s
better! Right!
Now for the ladder—yes, a chair will do—•
See how I’ll fix your little home for you !

Night in the Inkerinkerstrom.
THE mawbocks spreel throughout the
neevrious night,
The shadows darken in the pladious
pools,
The willock, soaring at some hirkling height
Fills earth and heaven with his eerie crools.
The shrimbling snow upon the fir-tree tons
Shimmers like slarth beneath the malpy
moon.
And Silence over all her mantle drops,
Stretching it far beyond the artholoon.
But yet, not all is silence ; for anon
The dreadful doodwunk in his forest lair
Emits a howl —immense, concord'on —
That frinks and frabbles on the dinkl.v air.
The sneaking waive that ambles through the
wold
Stands starped with terror at the voltish
sound :
Then, slinking starkly through the carpy
cold,
lie seeks a place where willowshees abound.
’Way north, where lonely stretch the blardic
bmnes.
A million lights are skinmpling in the sky,
Shooting to earth, eotangling in the dunes,
Filling the voorlt with wondrous majesty.
The lapal lights return from whence they
come,
And nought is here save firs and strabbl.v
snow:
Gaunt darkness shrouds the Inkerinker-
prtim.
And Night reigns all around, above, below!

“Joolery.”
OLD brass and bits o’ glass,
And ha’pennies that will not
pass ;
Drop ’em in the crucible,
Weave enchantments into ’em,
All such stuff’s reducible
Into gewgaws Beauty loves.
In each finger-ring a gem—
Beauty never fancies gloves.
Old brass and bits o’ glass,
And ha’pennies that will not pass;
“Ain’t it luvly joolery?”
When the alchemist has done.
“Chuck it, stop yer foolery !”
“ ’Ow’d ye like them sparklers, too?”
False the “dimon’s” ev’ry one,
But her sparkling eyes shine true!
Old brass and bits o’ glass,
And ha’pennies that will not pass;
Beauty knows a thing or two!
Bangles dangle from her wrist,
Fingers sport a ring or two,
And her cobber always wears
Knuckle-duster on his fist....
When he swings it, say your prayers!
Old brass and bits o’ glass,
And ha’pennies that will not pass;
Beauty must have “joolery.”
“’Ow’d yer like them dimonds, Lil?”
“Ain’t no time fer joolery !”
“Don’t they sparkle! Like yer eyes !
Love yer all me life I will!”
“Chuck it, don’t yer tell no lies !”
Old brass and bits o’ glass,
And ha’pennies that will not pass—
Roll ’em out dnd burnish ’em ;
Twist ’em into quaint designs,
Call ’em gold, and furnish ’em
With delusive paste for gems....
Beauty loves a brooch that shines,
Beauty loves her diadems.

The Birthstain.
IF only my great-grandsire had been sent
Out of his country for his country’s
good,
To help to people some new continent —
If thus I traced my lineage, I would
Face all the world with gallant hardihood,
For in my pedigree would be an entry
Like that of the nobility or gentry.
Suppose you sprang from Henry Morgan’s
line,
Or any other blood-stained buccaneer,
Would you go round with pallid face, and
sign
Your name as H. de Mugginson, for fear
The canting shop-bred folk would gibe and
jeer?
Not you: I wager you would make the most
of
Your ancestry, as something you could boast
of.
So I’d be glad if a pickpocket smart
Had captured grandma with his loving
smiles ;
I wouldn’t go around with careful art
Expunging records in the public files
(Criminal records of the British Isles) ;
But I would glory in their demonstration
Of genius in a previous generation.
I would be proud of some forefather who
Rode boldly on the highway for his gain,
Would brag of that rare cut-throat, if he
slew.
These being things of an heroic strain; _
Nor would I view his memory with pain
If he were dauntless in the inveterate habit
Of snaring in the dark the landlord’s rabbit.
Better than some prosaic, dull descent
It is to have a forebear who at least
In some way well above the average went:
Got by his loins my worth would be in-
creased
For history shows (and history has not
ceased)
How richly the new generation fallows
Whose procreator barely missed the gallows.
Thus I would thank my sires because they
gave
To me the faculty of thinking free,
Would bless their memory even in the grave
For lending me the rebel’s ecstasy,
Making me scorn the futile Powers that
Be;
But most for that fine talent they trans-
mitted
Of beating fellow-creatures less quick-witted.
Sometimes I dream myself of th t good
strain
Wherein there is no vile suburban smudge,
See my great grand-dad in the dock again,
Taking his gruel from the thin-lipped
Judge; , _
Thus having dreamed, to work I gaily
trudge
Rich in the ancestry which surely traces
My breed above the breed of commonplaces.
Alas! it is a fond and idle thought:
Mv veins contain no fluid so sublime.
Mv family alwavs did the things they ought.
Sold socks, mixed drugs, preached sermons
all the time.
And never rose to one courageous crime:
But oh. if only happy fate could fall so.
I wish I had a birth-stain! Don’t you also?

My Troubles.
THERE’S a time for mourning and an
hour for sin ;
There’s a day for whipping the old
cat’s skin;
There’s an early door when troubles begin;
But I don’t want to know it.
There’s a life of toiling until you die
In return for a good time by-and-bye,
With maybe a mansion beyond the sky;
But I don’t want to know it.
I just want to loaf on the fresh green
ground,
With the clouds above and the flowers-
around,
And the world asleep ’neatli the hills sun-
crowned.
For the rest —well, blow it!

Getting Home from the Function.
THE southern cross is all askew,
’Tis humpy-backed and bumble-footed-
Its upper pointers split in two;
Its near hind leg is spurred and booted-
This hut as well is all aglee,
Its western gable fronts the ranges,
And I am blest if I can see
The cause of all these sudden changes.
I haven’t had a drink since—well,
Since I fell in the excavation ;
And that’s some time, as I can tell
By astronomic computation.
’Twas twelve feet deep ; and ne’er before-
Had I explored the earth’s formation.
When I recovered, stiff and sore,
I had one glorious consolation ;
I thought at first I might be dead,
I knew I had a limekiln throttle;
In agony I raised my head,
And found I had not wrecked the bottle.
The Devil’s bairns their daddy’s luck
Inherit still in full and plenty,
And as my darling foe I suck
I find the fraud is whole —but empty.
It's nearly time I went to sleep—
Sweet solace for demented creatures
It’s better far to laugli than weep,
Could I control my outraged features..
I wonder can I find the bunk!
I’ve neither got a match nor taper.
The boss would swear that I was drunk
If he were here and saw me caper.
I trip and tumble o’er the broom,
And see stars blue and pink, in plenty.
I’m bushed and stranded in a room
That only measures ten by twenty.
I’ll just lie here till break o’ day.
I think I saw a horse and carriage,
But I’ll be hanged if I can say
If ’twas a funeral or a marriage.

KELPIE.
’Tis Drink that Makes the World
Go Round.
TIS Drink that makes the world go round,.
Whatever poets say,
To Drink, where countless woes lie-
drowned,
I therefore, tune this lay.
Its theme, of course, is very old,
But, also, ever new;
For Man, until his tale is told.
His liquor will pursue.
Love's giddiness may make you whirl
Around a time or two;
But when you’re wearied of the girl.
Or she has tired of you,
You find that sure nepenthe lies
In Bacchic groves alone,
And there’s surcease from “Stai’ry Eyes”'
When stars illume your own.
I never met the lady yet.
However kind and fair.
Whose graces I could not forget
With vine-leaves in the hair.
I never felt a pain whose bite
Or burn I could not pass
Away into the Ewigkeit
With bottle and with glass.
’Tis drink that cools us when we’re hot,
And warms us when we’re cold :
And Drink’s the only drug we’ve got
To make the timid bold.
Endowing with its fervent zest
The feeble as the fit,
It bids ns laugh at Life’s prim jest
And make the best of it.
To Drink, that makes the World go round,.
I dedicate this lay ;
To Drink, that, when a man is downed,
Can soothe his shame away;
To Drink, that, maybe, bucks him up
Fresh chances’ spoils to reap,
Or yields the clement Stirrup-Cup
That speeds him to his Sleep.

“The Butterfly Man,”
and ‘The Alternative.”
By GEORGE BARR McCUTCHEON. Price 1/-, Post Free 1/1.
Here we have two books for the price of one, and both are equally
good. “The Butterfly Man,” indeed, ranks amongst one of the cleverest
things of its kind, and enhanced this author’s reputation materially.
Essentially a hook for young men, sisters, and mothers, this work
draws such a pen picture of a selfish society butterfly that most people will
at once exclaim, “Just like young So-and-so.” . . .
The young man’s awakening is swift, severe and uncompromising; his
downfall complete, and the conclusion of the story is just as everyone hoped
f ° r ' “The Alternative” is a delightful story in McCutcheon’s best style, and
must be read to be appreciated.
“What's-His-Name?”
By GEORGE BARR McCUTCHEON.
Price I/-, Post Free 1/1.
By arrangement with the American publishers, Dodd, Mead & Co., of
New York, the N.S.W. Bookstall Co., Ltd., are able to put this famous
author’s expensive book on the Australian market at the low price of one
shilling, and those who are not conversant with the great American s work
should lose no time in reading “What’s-His-Name ?”
This is a charming story of a man who was always known as
“What’s-His-Name? You know. Nellie Duluth’s husband.”
Nellie was a favorite actress, whose profession permitted her no time
to attend to her home, with the results related in the book. An excep-
tionally interesting story, with a surprising finish of great power.

WE sit together on the cold, damp
strand ;
While Gertie babbles on. It wor-
ries me
To watch the moon, who, with a lavish
hand,
Is show’ring heaps of silver on the sea.
A shim’ring goddess robed in virgin light,
She, leaning forward from her argent
throne.
Takes from the sable apron of the Night
Handfuls of coins, which on the bay are
thrown.
I marvel at your prodigality,
O fair Selene, smiling up above;
And wish that you would lend your aid to
me
In coping with my Most Expensive Love!
Your silver dust, afloat beyond my reach,
For coffee, sweets and railway fares would
pay! •
If you'd but scatter some along the beach 1
Why waste your riches on the dreaming
bay?
I feel depressed and disinclined to spoon.
While in my pocket I’ve but shillings
three,
As from a cornucopia the moon
Is pouring silver down upon the sea!

Darling Sir : SYD.
It have long been my desireousness to in-
dicate an eepistol for your offalicial pur-
sueal: but between I and the accomplish-
ment have been always the expensiveness of
one d'eed stamp. Consequent I send this
C.0.D., same meaning, “Cough-up on Door-
step.” The noteable paper I abstract (in
moment of abstraction) from Hotel Meta-
poll.
On my voyage to this land of lords it be
not my intention to dwell—the Missmate he
make discovery of me three days out from
Addleaide, and I still carry symptoms of
what 1 1 is impolite boot say to me every time
I sit down, thank you—so much.
When first I make apparition in Lung-
done, I have pretence to be lion, member of
Ilorsetralia’s wicked Eleven, my nom dee
bat being Macarthorse (who is respectable
appearance I do much resemble) which same
supperfuge do give me much enjoyous at-
tentions, and the loves of many maidens —-
afterwards I confess myself as but the locoed
corespondent of S.vd. Bullock Team.
It be in that incapacity I interview Hon.
Prime Assquiff.
“What be your intention with regard to
Horsetralia V” I note of interrogation.
“We will protect you as we always have
do,” he splutter, “with our grate and gloriass
fleet.”
“Ho!” I ejaculate. “Which fleet be
where?”
“Horsetralia be in
no danger from
Japan,” he soot h e
me, “as long North
Sea full of English
ship which Dread-
nothing.”
“I suppose Zea-
land’s ship who
Dread-nothing will
protect Zealand by
swimming in North
Sea?” I flatter him.
“Exact,” he acs-
queeze. “When you
think Horsetralia
will do likewise
patri-rot action ?”
“When Syd. Bul-
lock Team come out
in orange cover, or-
nament by drawing
of yellow pups” I
slap back —and then
leave him to that
riddleness.
Lungdone be Num-
ber One nice plaice
just now; in East,
owing to dock struck,
all the peoples be
deading of starva-
tion, while at Wind-
sor just now, hon.
King ask ten thou-
sand peoples to have
feed on his lawn. Of
course I instant think
how kind and good
he be, then I make
discovery he ask no
mans from East who
be starving, but in-
vite all from West
who be nearly dead-
ing of overeat and
dispepper. Lungdone, I make repetition, be
a nice plaice.
Other day Bullman make me a joke, I re-
peat to show his foolishness: “Two men
went into Pub to get a drink, one was a
Scotchman, while the tother had not got any
money either.”
Of this I see no point.
Expecting you to do the same,
I am.

THE SPIDER and the Duke were slowly
padding along the dusty road. The
Spider, of course, was not a spider,
any more than the Duke was a duke; but
one was supposed to be a wrecked book-
maker, and legend had it that the other was
the last ruin or derelict of a noble family.
Both stories were wholly false.
They were not particular as to how they
earned their daily bread, so long as it was
not by the sweat of their brows, but they
had lately been on a streak of bad luck, and
the bread had been scarce in consequence.
Just at present they were humping bluey
and living on what Fortune sent. Also, they
were working out a scheme to be tried in the
little township ahead. It was based on
something the Duke had read the day before
in a fragment of stray newspaper.
In pursuance of the scheme the Spider
walked alone into the bar of the only pub.
He bore a demeanor of such assurance, and
his cheery “Hornin’ ” was so careless that
the publican decided that, despite appear-
ances, he had money wherewith to buy a
drink. Spider dropped his swag and leaned
on the bar. “Pretty hot walkin’,” he re-
marked affably, wiping his forehead with his
coat sleeve. The publican agreed, and waited
for the order. “I haven’t got the brass fer
a drink, boss,” said Spider frankly, “but I
know you ain’t the sort to” The publi-
can interrupted him. “No free drinks
here,” he said shortly. He was so very short
that his visitor drew himself up and looked
surprised. “Righto,” he said at last; “but
I suppose a bit er tucker” “This ain’t
a station where we gives rations to every
sundowner,” said the publican coldly. “Well,
look ’ere,” said Spider in tones of despair;
“what d’yer want a bloke ter do. I know
yer a good sort ter us chaps on the road —-
leastways yer was ter th’ las’ one as was in
’ere. D’yer want any wood split?” “No, I
don’t, an’ I dunno what you mean about
being good to the last swaggie was in. If I
was he paid for wot ’e ’ad.” “No, ’e didn’t
neither,” said the Spider with mild persist-
ence. “Well, who was ’e, and wot did I do?”
asked the landlord. “I carn’t tell yer that,”
said the Spider. “I haven’t see’d ’im.”
“How d’yer i;now about it then?” asked the
publican curiously. “That’s er secret,”
Spider said. “Only, look ’ere, I’m damn ’ard
up, an’ if yer’ll stan’ a drink an’ some
tucker I’ll put yer up ter the dodge.” He
looked hard at the man of beer, and the man
of beer looked hard at him in return, and
smiled the smile of contempt. Also, he
shook his untidy head.
“Let’s ’ear the dodge,” he said, “an’ if it’s
worth it you’ll get the drink an’ the tucker.
I don’t buy no pig in a sack.” “That’s good
enuff, boss,” said Spider, “I’d trust yer fer a
white man, an’ I’ll si >w yer. Come outside
’ere.”
When they got to th door Spider pointed
out a little pencil-marki ' circle with a stroke
drawn through it. ‘ Some swaggie thet
passed lately put that there,” he said, “and
the one that passed last let it stay there. It
means that, the bloke inside is a decent sorter
bloke, an’ is good fer a bit er tucker an’ a
drink. That’s why I thought I was all
right. ’Course we has different signs mean-
in’ different things. Like ‘No* good tryin’
’ere,’ or Aou can get tucker, but they’ll

make yer work fer it,’ an’ things like that.
All ther reg’lar swaggies knows the lurk, an’
can read the ‘Sundowner-sign’ as we calls
it.” The publican looked thoughtful. “An’
if I rubs this out,” he said. “Then you’ll be
all right.” said the Spider cheerfully, “an’
yer won’t be so likely ter be bothered.”
“Come inside.” said the publican, and th“
Spider followed him in and watched with
glistening eyes while he filled a medium beer.
“Wait an’ I’ll get yer some tucker,” and pre-
sently set half a loaf and some cold meat on
a table. Then he fell into deep thought and
watched his visitor eat ravenously for a
time.
“Funny I never heard o’ this sundowner-
sign business,” he said at last thoughtfully.
“ You’d, never ’ear much of it,” said the guest
through a mouthful of bread and beef. “You
see, it wouldn’t be much use if we told
everybody erbout it.” “Is ther any sign

alive hadn’t better come in,” asked the land-
lord. “Yes, there is something like that.”
“Well, s’posin’ you puts that sign on my
door” “No, boss, I c’u’dn’t do that. It
would be sorter mean to ther boys. An’ if
they ever found me out I’d have a helluva
time on the road,” said Spider as he emptied
the last of his glass with the air of a hero.
The publican slowly took down a long
beer glass, and filled it to the brim. Spider
wiped his mouth with the back of his hand
and waited expectantly. “Well, if you
won’t,” said the landlord, and he lifted the
glass and drank half of it off. Spider shook
his head regretfully. “I could ’ardly do it,” 1
he murmured, and lifted his empty glass and
tried to drain the last drops out. When he
put it down the publican picked it up and
held it a moment. Spider’s hopes rose, only
to be dashed as he saw the glass plunged in
a basin of water, rinsed out, and placed up-
side down on the bar. “That’s good beer
yer keep,” he said insinuatingly. “Yes,”
said the other absently ; “hope you’ll recom-
mend it to yer friends.” Spider laughed
uproariously at this, till he caught the look
of cold disfavor in the other’s eye. “What’s
the joke?” said the publican. “Can’t yer
recommend it?” “Yes, yes,” said Spider
hastily, cutting off the laugh. “Of course I
can. I was only thinkin’ my friends wouldn’t
be much good t’ yer.” And there was a long
pause.
When he finished his meal the Spider re-
marked, “That was a dash good feed. Wish
I was as sure the nex’d be as good.” “I might
give yer a bit o’ tucker fer th’ road,” said
the publican, “but if it got about that I was
rationin’ swaggies.” “D’yer think I’d go
givin’ it erway like that arter yer treatin’
me white like y’ve done?” asked Spider
indignantly. “Spare me days! Any cove
as I meets I’ll put right off this place.”
“Well, why not put that sign on th’ door-
post?” asked the publican. “Since yer puts
it like that,” said the Spider thoughtfully,
“it does seem ther same thing. I might put
suthin’ ”. . . .The publican filled a long beer
and put it on the bar. The sight of the tall,
brown, foaming liquor ended all hesitation.
The swagman was tempted and he fell.
He borrowed a pencil and proceeded to
scrawl on the door-post, explaining as he
went along: “That sorter V with the knob
on ther end means an arm an’ fist, showin’
yer a bit o’ a bruiser. Puttin’ a nose up agin
ther fist means nacherally a cove’s apt ter
git a punch. That’s a leg an’ foot.” (“I’d
never’ve guessed it,” said the landlord.)
“That means a chap’ll git booted out. An
O means ‘tucker ’ere,’ an’ the stroke means
beer. But I blacks in the O an’ it means
‘no tucker,’ and I makes the stroke thick,
and it ses ‘no beer.’ Then that swag,”
drawing a thing like a sausage with a string
to it, “that means ‘ ’ump yer bluey an’ git
out.’ ”
Next day the publican was explaining to
two customers —the local butcher and the
storekeeper—how he had provided against
future annoyance from swaggies, and in his
joy and confidence he took them to the door
to point out the meanings of the sundowner
sign. And just then the Duke hove in
sight.
“Here’s a swaggio now,” said the butcher.
“Let’s get inside an’ watch ’im through the
window.” “You’ll see ’im shy off when he
sees that, like a butcher shies off sausages,”
chuckled the publican.
The three watched the Duke approach.
They saw him sight the pub and steer
for it. By craning into the corner
°f the window they could see him stop and
study the sundowner sign, and the landlord
tittered and nudged the others with expecta-
tion. Then, to his surprise, he saw a pleased
smile light up the Duke’s face, and next
instant the door swung open and the aristo-
cratic wreck entered.
“Wot th’ ’ell d’ye want?” the publican de-
manded fiercely, as the giggles of his cus-
tomers reached his ears. The nobleman of
the road drew himself up as if surprised.
“I want to see the landlord,” he said, staring
hard. “Well, you’ve got wot you want.
I’m ’im—so now git out,” was the ungraci-
ous reply. “Pardon me,” said the Duke,*
with every appearance of being puzzled, “I
don’t wish to intrude, but I’d like to ’ave
a word with you. I’ve recently encountered
extraneous ’ard luck.” “You’ll encounter
worse’n that if y’ don’t clear out,” said the
publican. “Idold on,” said the butcher.
“Let’s find out about that business. You
leave ’im t’me. ’Ere, mate. You c’d do a
drink, I s’pose?” “Try me,” responded the
Duke gratefully.
When a long beer was provided the
butcher said, “Can you read sundowner-
sign V” The Duke looked at him over the
edge of his tumbler till the rising bottom
obscured his eyes. “I fails to preconceive
your meanin’ exackly,” he said slowly.
“That’ll do you,” said the butcher impati-
ently. “We saw y’ look at it ’fore y’ came
in. We knows it, but we’ve got a little dis-
pute about th’ exac’ meanin’, so we wants
y’ to explain it.” “Why, then,” said the
Duke joyfully, “if you understands it, you
muster bin on the road yourself one time.
You know wot it is, an’ you won’t be ’ard.”
“That’s a’right,” said the butcher. “Tell us
this, and then come alonger me an’ I’ll givyer
a bit o’ steak.” “But wot about this gent?”
said the Duke, looking at the landlord. “If
I explains to him, he’ll rub that sign off
quick—mighty quick,” and he grinned. The
landlord pondered. “I’ll rub it orf any’ow,”
he said, brightening. The Duke only laughed.
“An’ supposing someone came along after
dark,” he said, “and put up another one,
where you wouldn’t know where to look for
it, but every swaggie would. I don’t say as
I’d do it, but—an’ it might be signs that’d
bring every swaggie for miles round along
to you.” “I’ll give yer a feed an’ another
drink,” the landlord capitulated quickly,
“provided you don’t do it, an’ you tell me
what this sign means. An’ if you hurry up
I’ll give you a bit o’ tea and sugar,” put in
the storekeeper.
So the bargain was struck, and the Duke
led the way to the door without more ado.
“See that V and the mark against a chap’s
nose —that means ‘vei’y soft mark to bleed.’
S and a mark would be ‘soft mark.’ V’s
‘very soft.’ ” The landlord gasped. Then
the foot and leg means ‘pull his leg!’ Of
course you know the signs for tucker and
beer?” the Duke went on, turning to the
butcher. “Yes, yes, but tell them,” said
the butcher, in whose breast the publican’s
remark about sausages still rankled. “Well,
the tucker sign is a O,” went on the Duke,
“an’ the beer sign is a stroke.” “But when
they’re filled up?” asked the publican, anxi-
ously hoping against hope that he had not
been altogether fooled. “Filled up is right,”
said Duke. “That means the chap that put
this here was filled up with both.” “Damn
’im,” said the publican fervently, “’e was.”
“An’ that swag.” continued the Duke,
“means he got tucker for the road.” “Damn
’ im ,” said the publican still more fervently:
“’E did!”
After the Duke had collected his rewards,
he offered for a little extra remuneration to
ornament his benefactors’ door-posts with
a sign that would scare every swagman into
the next county. They all declined, and the
publican turned the conversation by asking
the butcher how much he wanted for that
bull-terrier pup. An hour _ later he tacked
up a fresh sundowner sign in neat lettering.

Gas Roses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE roses on the bedroom wall
Bloom on from year to year;
They never fade, they never fall.
( Tis paste that holds those blooms in
thrall:
To plaster they adhere.)
Gas-brackets like dead branches hang
From those pink vines of bliss.
Sometimes I light them with a bang
To gild the converse of the gang,
But mostly they just hiss.
Those thin and hollow reeds of lead
That twine about the rooms,
Give off a smell of carrion dead,
And need to be with matches fed,
Ere putting forth their blooms.
They hiss like serpents ere a bud
Of pallid flame is seen ;
It makes the darkness like thin mud,
Till gradually a ghostly flood
Shows ev’ry face pale green.
The crouching meter, inch by inch,
Keeps count by night and day ;
Before its bills the boldest flinch,
So ev’ry tap we screw and pinch,
And stumble on our way.
But raw and reckless Mary Ann
Beneath each pan and pot
Turns on a dear and flaming fan ;
Since dishes, gas and time began
She has not cared a jot.
We dare not blight her grove of gas,
Or nip the fiow’rs that blow.
Her gardening she does, alas!
Nor cares how many A’apors pass
To make her flaming show.
rile hot, white roses spurt and blow
Where’er the house-boss turns;
And though he softly turns them low
And creeps away so none may know,
Still money—money burns !
The crouching meter lies in wait
Beyond the radiance dim ;
It b'dos its time like Death and Fate
That mechanism made of hate,
And charges up each glim.
The shrinking house-boss his dim way
Pursues unto the end,
Among the costly blooms and gay,
Until he has to help to pay
The usual dividend.
A mere fifteen per cent, or so
Is modest, you’ll allow, (
To see the rare gas roses blow.
And the white hand of some gas co.
Upon the leaden bough.

FINAL NOTICE.
Doolan, the Dentist.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE individual sitting at the fire emitted
a squeal of anguish, like unto that of
the stricken pig. Ilis recumbent mate
raised himself upon one horny elbow.
“Gripes !! !” he announced, with emphasis.
The enthusiastic squealer sputtered forth
a torrent of highly decorative eloquence,
while the emphatic one studied him with in-
terest.
THE ORIGIN OF HOME TAILORINGS.
Eve cuts down Adam's second-best figleaf for little Cainy.
“What did y’ dof” he queried at length.
The complainant paused to explain.
‘Tli’ damn thing kep’ achin’ worse "n’
worse,” lie spluttered, “ ’n’ I thought I’d try
that dodge the woman told me, about stickin’
a hot hairpin in it. Not bein’ in th’ habit o’
wearin’ hairpins I got a bit o’ number ten
wire an’ made it red-hot; V just as I wuz
stickin’ it in th’ holler, me blessed tongue
touched tli’ blarsted wire. Holy Flyback!!”
he added with conviction, “that blamed wire
was HOT.”
His mate nodded sympathetically. “I
thought it wuz somethink,” he said mus-
ingly.
“ Somethinlc!” the wire-manipulator snort-
ed indignantly. “D’ye think I’d screech like
that fer notliink? I wouldn’t ’a’ cared,” he
went on, “on’y me tooth’s achin’ a dashed
sight worse than ever now.”
The recumbent one slowly upended him-
self.
“I wuz thinkin’,” he ruminated, “that cove
that’s camped round th’ bend there (Dool-
an’s ’e’s name. I knoo ’im in Queensland
wonst). Well, ’e’s a bit uv a amachure
quack, but I d’no can e drore teeth. I see
’im set a cove’s leg wonst where there wuz
no docter ’andy. ’E made a clinkin’ good
job uv ut, too, uz fur uz tli’ settin’ part went,
but th’ cove died, after all ’is trouble. They
took ’im in ter tli’ doctor about a Aveek after
it ’appened, an’ tli’ doctor said ’e’d gorn
green in th’ leg. Be all accounts ’e ’ad, too.
But that wuzn’t Doolan’s fault. Wuz it?”
Seeing that the afflicted one had too much
hand in his mouth to reply at once, he pro-
ceeded with his testimony.
“Another time I see ’im out near Clon-
curry doctorin’ up a big buck nigger—I think
it wuz the distemper Doolan said ’e ’ad-
Any’ow, Doolan had a box o’ these ’ere blue
and Avhite powders—settlin’ powders, ’e
called ’em- —’n’ ’e gives th’ nigger a blue wan
fust, ’n’ a white wun after, ’n’— Gripes —y’
ort t’ seen that nigger pig-jump! Dargan’s
grey was notliink to ’im. Settlin’ powders.”
He smiled reminiscently. “They darned
near settled that nigger, anyway.”
He paused for a moment, then resumed:
“My oath, Doolan’s a good amachure right
enough; but I d’no ’ow ’e goes on stump
jerkin’. ’E’ll ’ave a cut at it, though. ’E’s
one o’ these ’ere coves ’e’d ’ave a fly at any-
tliink.”
The suffering one seemed unimpressed. As
most of his attention was devoted to his
tooth, while his blistered tongue also de-
manded a share, his mate’s recital had been,
to some extent, wasted on the desert air.
Still, he gathered vaguely that there was
someone about who could draw teeth.
“Where is he?” he demanded.
Doolan’s disciple was obviously elated.
“Who? Doolan? Oh, that’s ’im camped
just round th’ bend. Come on, an’ we’ll
see what ’e thinks about it.”
Doolan turned out to be a nuggetty Irish
person, with a humorous grin and the eye of
an experimentalist. The joyous counten-
ance smiled a welcome. The experimenting
eye roved over the prospective patient with
a hopeful gleam. Despite the disastrous re-
sults that had attended most of his efforts
in the healing art, his enthusiasm was still
strong.
“Will, Ted, ye divil,” he began, cheer-
fully, "phwat brings ye along here now?
Wantin’ me t’ play docther agin, ar’re you?
Well! Well! Look at that, now.”
Ted nodded an affirmative.
“I just brung Bill along. ’E’s got an
’oiler tooth troublin’ ’im,.’n' I thort y’ might
yank it out f’r ’im, if y’ ’ad a pair o’ pliers
in y’r swag.”
Doolan considered deeply. His ignorance
of dentistry was, if possible, more profound
than his incapacity as a surgeon. Still, he
had his reputation to consider. In any
case, he reflected, he had no dental instru-
ments, and it was unlikely that there were
any at the pub half a mile away. There
was no other place within 20 miles where
such things might be procured. It seemed
safe to be a dentist under the circum-
stances. Doolan decided to chance it.
and the lower portion of William’s face un-
folded to an alarming extent. Doolan gazed
into the fissure unappalled.
“Which wan?” he asked in his best pro-
fessional tone. A stubbly finger indicated
the offender.
“Oi see.” He glared fixedly at the grind-
ing apparatus, and racked his brain for an
effective diagnosis.
“Th’ sooper’rfishal incroostashin,” he an-
nounced at length, with- becoming Gravity,
“hov become daycompoased thro’ tli’ ripiti-
shin av th’ proaciss av masticayshin.”
BEFORE THE LOAN.
DUNDONALD : “I say, old fellow; do you
believe in the proverb , ‘A friend in need is
a friend indeed’?”
OLDFELLOW (suspiciously): “It all depends
How mmh are you in need of?”
The proprietor of the tooth was much
impressed. “I know the blessed thing
aches,” he asseverated-
Ted brightened up at the prospect of see-
ing his “amachure quack” practising.
Doolan, he considered, was a person who
should be encouraged to practise—on anyone
but him.
"Can y’ yank it out f’r ’m, Doolan?” he
inquired, eagerly.
Doolan temporised.
“Will Oi c'u’d , me bye,” he said regret-
fully, "but ut hoppens Oi lift iv’ry wan o’
me for’rce-ups in tli’ township beyant.”
He waved his hand gracefully in the direc-
tion of nowhere in particular. Then, as the
inspiration came to him: “The loacal din-
tist,” he added gravely, “borried th’ lot.”
Ted was not to be denied.
“Tell y’ wot,” he suggested cheerfully,
“we’ll all go up t’ tli’ pub. I heard Smith
talkin’ yesterd'y about some cove that
pegged out there larst week; V ’e’s things is
there yet. I b’leeve Smith said ’e wnz a
stump igstracter.”
The idea impressed Bill favorably, but
Doolan raised objections. He could not, he
explained, think of using the instruments of
a departed brother specialist. Professional
etiquette forbade such conduct. The consent
of the deceased’s executors must be obtained.
Bill turned on him savagely.
“Perfesh’nal ettykit be blowed,” he
snorted. “I d’no wot ettykit ’ll do t’ y’ if
y’ do pull it, but I’m goin’ t’ erfeck’shuly
stoush y’ if y’ don’t.”
Doolan elected to ignore ettykit. They
broached the matter to Smith while he was
getting the drinks. Smith was delighted.
For the past week life at Skeleton Creek
had been flat, stale and desperately unprofit-
able. Save the burial of the dentist, who
had got off the passing coach and died before
he could spend any money in drink, there
had been nothing of a cheerful nature. Three
travellers and a tooth-pulling looked encour-
aging.
“Why not?” he demanded of an imaginary
obstructionist. “Th’ poor feller left an ele-
gant little box full uv knives an’ pincher’rs
an’ gimlits, an’ th’ devil knows what, an’
they lyin’ ther’re eatin’ their’r heads aff f’r
th’ want uv work. Ov course I’ll lend them
t’ ye.”
He produced the box with manifest pride.
Doolan opened it gingerly, as though it were
an infernal machine, and scanned the instru-
ments in a state of indecision.
To retreat was impossible.
To fail was undesirable.
He strove vainly to remember which
weapon the dentist had used when last he
had been the victim, and in desperation he
chose the strongest. If anything broke it
might be Bill, but it wouldn’t be the forceps.
So he grasued the instrument and bore down
upon his prev. Bill eyed the weapon and
wavered visibly.
“I’m blowed if I know,” he ventured, hesi-
tatingly. “It don’t seem t’ be achin’ like it
wuz a while back. How’d it be t’ wait ’n’
see if it stops?”
Doolan looked relieved, but there was no
wavering on the part of Ted —nor of Smith.
“Gam!” Ted’s contempt was withering.
“Wot’s th’ good o’ crawfishin’ now? It’ll
be worse agin y’ git back t’ th’ camp. Don’t
be a kid.”
Smith was equally brave. lie urged in-
stant action. Some men have an absolute
contempt for pain. So Bill and Doolan re
signed themselves to the inevitable
Doolan seated the patient on the strongest
available chair, and besought him to grasp
the sides of the furniture with great firm-
ness. Then lie implored Ted and Hogan to
grasp William with intense firmness. Doolan
was taking no chances. After that he par-
took of an exceedingly stiff whisky, and ap-
proached his victim with the air of an exe-
cutioner.
“Lay ’oor head
back an’ orpen
oor’ mout’ woide,”
h e commanded.
Bill’s head became
a J enolan cave.
Doolan ner-
vously thrust in
the forceps, took
a tremendous
grip, braced his
foot against the
nearest wall, and
PULLED!
When he gath-
ered himself out
of the fireplace, he
observed that
there was a tooth
in the business
end of the stump
extractor. He no-
ticed, also, that
William had ar-
isen from his chair
and was making
frantic attempts
to approach him.
It was likewise
apparent that
Smith and Ted
were grasping
William with un-
diminished firm-
ness. Evidently,
they were congra-
tulating him. Doo-
lan a d v a n ced,
waving the trophy
aloft.
“Ut’s arl roight,
me bye,” he shout-
ed cheerily. “Oi
hov th’ slipalpeei;.
He'll niver throu-
ble y’ agin.”
He gazed on the
molar with pro-
fessional pride,
and Bill fought
desperately with
h i s custodians.
Bill seemed great-
ly excited. Doubt-
less he was elated
at the success of
the operation.
Doolan became sympathetic.
“No wondher ut hur’rted ye,” he said.
“ ’Tis th’ ahfull, turrible obsciss wuz at th’
roots iv ut. Oi niver remember’r th’ loikes
iv ut in arl me per’rfish’nul igspeer’nce.”
He smiled benignly.
Bill broke from the restraining hands and
smote his benefactor with vigor and pre-
cision. There was a chair behind Doolan.
He performed an involuntary acrobatic feat
and resumed his position in the fireplace.
The grateful patient followed up.
THE MATTERHORN MEETS WITH
AN ACCIDENT.
“Abscess be damned!” he snarled vindic-
tively. “Y’ flamin’ coot! You’ve yanked
out th’ on’y sound tooth I ’ad. Fer two Dins
I’d”
Smith caught his arm.
“That’ll do,” he said sympathetically.
“Let it go at that, an’ we’ll all have a drink
on th’ strength if it.” Bill became mutin-
ous.
“An’ wot about me tooth?” he shouted
bitterly. Smith regarded him with amaze-
ment.
“To tli’ devil with y’r tooth,” said he.
“Beltin’ Doolan won’t put it back, will it?”
Bill cooled down a trifle, and Ted chipped
in.
“Wot’s th’ odds? Anyway,” he remarked,
“Y’d ’ave t’ git it out some day; an’ th’
longer y’ ’ad it, th’ more y’d miss it.”
The irate one relented some more, and
Doolan joined in.
“Maybe,” he ventured, “ ’twould hov
ached something terrible wan o’ those days;
an’, when it does, ye’ll be thankin' me thot
it isn’t there.”
He paused dramaticallv, then: “Come
ahn, mahn,” he added persuasively, “an’ we’ll
hov’ thim dhrinks.”
Bill surrendered unconditionally.
“Right-oh,” he said. “Come on. Wot’s
it goin’ t’ be?”
And Doolan, with honors and ashes thick
upon him, foretold that his would be rum

A Game of Cards.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AFTER his first anger had gone from
him, Painter’s voice grew cool. He
picked up his cigar and puffed it into
new life.
“You’ve got to go after him, Johnny,” he
said. “Got to get on the move right away.”
Johnny wiped his forehead. The night
was cold, but still he perspired.
“Why me?”
“Because,” said Painter quietly, “it was
your blundering that put us in this mess.”
Johnny’s jaw fell.
“How was I to know?” he whined, “that
you’d marked the cards?”
Painter laughed.
“You might have known that when I let
you win.”
Johnny gnawed his forefinger, but said
nothing. It was a cold night with a biting
westerly wind, and a drive of five miles,
with trouble at the end of it, did not appeal
to him.
“When you get to his house, you know
what to say?” queried the other.
“No,” said Johnny, “you’re the artist in
talk. Hadn’t you better go? I might fail.”
Painter knocked the ash from his cigar.
“I won’t go,” he said ; “and you mustn’t
fail.”
“But if I do?”
“Then, to-morrow, we shall be in gaol.
You’ll be there for a certainty.”
Johnny wiped the wet from his forehead
again.
“Let me tell you the story he will tell,”
said Painter. “He will go to the police and
show them the cards. He will say, ‘I played
till 12 o’clock last night with two men. I
thought them gentlemen. One, at least,
seemed so. That impression led me to be
foolish, and, although I never played for
money before, I lost £5OO to them —to one
of them, at least, a fellow named James.’
Then the police will inquire what style of
man you are, and he’ll describe you and
they’ll know you at once. Are you listening,
Johnny?”
James glared a reply. “And what about
you, eh?”
“I’m coming to that. They’ll ask particu-
lars, then, as to how the card party came
to be arranged, and they’ll find it was just
a casual affair —too casual, in fact. My
name will be drawn into it, and they will
remember that you and I have been through
many a little thing together before this. He

will tell them how I sought him out to
dine with me; how I won his confidence
with good wine and better stories. Then
to-night’s highly accidental meeting with you
will be described. He will mention your sug-
gestion that we should have a game to while
the time away, and dilate on my unwilling-
Bmf that waited only on his willingness.
The last touch will be added when he
describes how, in utter kindness of heart, I
unbent and consented to take a hand.”
“It won’t be a good story for either of
us,” said Johnny.
“It won't, indeed, and how the old Super-
intendent, who knows you so well, will laugh
when Mason comes to tell how he got the
cards from you ! He will picture the easy
way in which I drew a cheque for my los-
ings and passed it over to you. Then how
I looked at my watch, ejaculated as to the
lateness of the hour, and hurried off to my
honest couch, like a little bird to its nest.
He will say : ‘I followed my generous and
intellectual friend’s lead in the matter of
handing over a cheque, but just as I rose
to go something in James’s eye —something
that was not quite honest —attracted me,
and I felt that I had been swindled. Then
lie will tell how he got the cards from you
under the pretext of preserving them as an
endearing memento of the occasion.”
Painter paused : “It teas as a memento —-
he sought them?”
“No, it was not,” growled Johnny. “It
was as a warning to him never to plav for
money again.”
"Just so —as a moral reminder. It means
the same thing, Johnny; and he holds the
joker.”
“Well, what more does it mean?”
“The loss of my reputation, seemingly,
and of your liberty—certainly.”
James turned pale.
“It looks like it,” he assented.
“Unless, of course, yon can get the cards
before morning.”
Johnny rose, took a brandy, drew on his
coat, and walked to the door.
“Here, take his cheque,” said Painter.
“Five hundred sweet pounds. You may need
it —or. rather, he may.”
It was a cold and dark and cheerless
drive to the suburban residence of Mr.
Mason, and Johnny was not sorry when he
stood at its door. He knocked very gently,
so as to raise no unnecessary ire within,
and with a lifted hat and a troubled face
stood facing the master of the house when
the door was opened.
“You !” said Mason in surprise. But he
collected himself a moment later, and con-
tinued : “Step inside, and warm yourself.”
Johnny’s heart thawed. Here was a hos-
pitable beginning, at any rate.
“I suppose,” he began, but Mason inter-
rupted him.
“Have some brandy,” he said. “You are
shivering.”
Johnny felt better after the brandy, and
cast a careless glance at the table. A lamp
with a green shade stood there. Johnny was
grateful for the shade. Notepaper and en-
velopes were strewn about, but these things
did not interest him. The thing that did
interest Johnny was not on the table.
Johnny looked from the table to Mason.
Mason’s face was in shadow, too. How
Johnny would have liked the lamp-shade to
have been tilted a little so that he might see
Mason’s eyes.”
“I suppose you think my visit a bit outer
the way?” began Johnny.
“Somewhat.”
Johnny heaved his chest to simulate a
sigh, and was silent for a little.
“AVell,” he said, “did you ever know any
one to be took with it?”
“With what?”
“With religion. Took with it from ’ead
to ’eels. Took with it right up ’n’ down the
spine before ’e knew where ’e was. Took
with it suddenly.”
Mason was silent. In the silence Johnny
could feel that he was being summed up soul
and body. Presently Mason said, “I only
knew one man and he was an arrant scoun-
drel.”
“Great Scott,” ejaculated Johnny, “the
swine!”
“Yes,” said Mason, “it was thirty years

liowl about the Narrow Way. lie won my
confidence, but, while I was away from the
station, he played the villain. He paid for
it afterwards.’
“How?”
Mason threw the stump of his cigar into
the fire.
“He had a fortnight’s start of me, but my
blood was up, and I went after him. I went
up the Darling—up the Warrego into
Queensland, and two weeks after crossing
the border I got him.”
“And gave him up to the police/”
“No.”
Johnny’s hair trembled.
“Brought him back with you?” _
“No,” said Mason grimly, “I sent him
where conversions, sudden or otherwise, don’t
count.” _
Johnny’s impulse was to rise and leave
suddenly. He had not met this type of man
before.
“It’s all U.P.,” thought he, but even a rat
makes a fight. ,
“Well, I don’t know much about him,
Mister Mason,” he _ said, solemnly, “but I
was took regler, serious bad to-night. I re-
membered me mother, an’ the Bible, and the
parson, an’ things like that.”
Mason did a laugh.
“When was this?” he asked.
“When you said, ‘These cards will be a
warning to me to gamble no more.”
“Indeed!”
“Yes, I sat for a half hour, an thought,
an’ thought._ And then I said: ‘ hs right,
It’s the Devil’s game. Win or lose, its the
Devil’s game.’ I said, I’ll stick to re-
ligion, an’ I came ’ere quick. I wanted to
change slap-bang. ’
Mason pondered as to wuetner or not the
man had suddenly become a lunatic. His
silence made Johnny impetuous.
“The _ wages of sin is death, but card-
money is damnation, said Johnny.
It s a Pity, said Mason, that you didn t
think so before we played to-night.

RODERIC QUINN.
Maggs.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SAID the suave sub-editor: “Would you
mind going out to Mr. Maggs’s. His
copy has not come to light, and I
can’t keep the machines waiting. I’ll eet
Mr. Dicks to do the Fellmongers for you.”
The Fellmongers’, dry, long-winded, big-
bellied and platitudinous, is a meeting I ab-
hor. Maggs lived two miles distant. I had
a bike. It meant a night off. Cloaking an
immensity of joy beneath an aggrieved ex-
pression, I dejectedly left the room.
Not till the office was far astern did I give
play to my feelings, and then I suddenly re-
membered that Maggs owns a dog. It is not
an ordinary dog, either in size, temperament
or anything else. Maggs says it is a deer-
hound. Other people call it a catastrophe.
Because it never attacks him, Maggs chooses
to consider it harmless, although he knows
perfectly well that only the other day it
dragged down a dray horse, and killed it,
and ate most of it.
The closer I got to Maggs’s the more un-
comfortable I felt. When I dismounted
opposite it seemed absurd to go all the way
up the path to the front door, when I could
easily call Maggs from the road. I called
thrice, and woke the dog, which straightway
began to bark in a deep, gnashing, blood-
curdling bass. As the beast seemed about to
break its chain, my voice became rather
mild —quite apologetic, in fact. I picked up a
stone and threw it, hoping to hit Maggs’s
window. I prayed it might accidentally
break the glass. I should have been over-
joyed had it happened to hit Maggs on the
ear. But it must have found the dog in-
stead, for judging from the rumpus Wolf
seemed to have gone mad. I had not de-
cided whether the row most resembled a bull
in convulsions or an elephant trying to hang
itself with a chain cable, when a snap and
the ring of links on brickwork told me the
dog had broken loose.
“Thank the Lord,” I exclaimed fervently,
looking gleefully at the shut gate, “the tor-
nado can’t get out.” At that instant, the
brute fired itself through a hole in the hedge
and came for me. Instinctively I skipped
to the other side of my bicycle, and the deer-
hound hit the pedal with his eye. This did
not improve his temper much, and he made
a frenzied effort to annihilate me through
the spokes, and smashed three of them.
There was still a light in Maggs’s window.
He was, doubtless, within; presumably
drinking beer. Just as if a man lias a right
to sit at home swilling while his darned dog
is around slaying the populace.
Then the animal essayed a turning move-
ment, and tried to run round on me, but
giving the handle bars a providential twist,
I smote him violently on the nose with the
rim of the front wheel, damaging his smeller
severely. He then took to running rings,
rushing in at intervals to bite, while I
knocked corners off myself trying to keep the
bike between us. By this time the neighbor-
hood was aroused —all except Maggs. Folks
in white apparel appeared at bedroom win-
dows. They mistook me for a burglar bailed
up by an intelligent quadruped, and rejoiced
collectively. One old lady chirruped for the
police, what time the heap of hair and fury
had got himself sprawled up on to the saddle
(as though he was going to ride the dashed
machine) and was reaching vigorously for
my windpipe. Then he fell over backwards,
and, mounting in haste, I pedalled for town.
I rode like Gehenna with the broken spokes
tinkling merrily, and a cyclone of dog rag-
ing in the vicinity of the back tyre.
Wolf gave up after a block or so. and in
need of stimulants I fell into the office and
said things.
I had to take the blame because Maggs’s
stuff did not appear in next morning’s paper.
When I upbraided Maggs for his ungentle-
manly conduct, he had the cheek to hint that
I must have been drinking.
I should have come in. The pup was quite
docile, he said.
Now the accountant has queried an item in
my expense account, “Repairs to bicycle,
12s. 6d.” This, he; argues, cannot be an
office matter.
The suave sub-editor says nothing.
The Fellmongers’ meeting lapsed for want
of a quorum.
People like Maggs make me tired.

Before talking of the Sea and the advantages of a Sea-Life in the
Royal Australian Navy, it is just as well to create the right sort
of atmosphere.
“Of the complexity of the Sea, and of how it is manifold, and of
how it mixes np with a man, and may Broaden or Perfect him.”
—Thus Hilaire Belloc in one of his delightful Sea Essays.
May Broaden or Perfect him! That’s one of the Sea’s Mysteries.
Again listen to the same writer in praise of waves: “The long-haired
wave, the graceful wave, the wave that breaks on an Island a
long way off, the sandy wave, the wave before, the wave that
brings good tidings.”
And so on.
Now Jack, Will and Tom Cornstalk, whodiave those waves stirring
in your young blood, do you realise that the establishment of
the Royal Australian Navy Means Opportunity?
Opportunity to follow the sort of life you long for.
Do you realise you are First-Comers ? And, naturally, the First- j
Comers will have the best chances of scaling the ladder of pro- ;
motion in the World’s Youngest Navy.
Sydney Boys don’t need to be told where the Boys’ Training Ship
“Tingira” is moored ; but, for the information of boys in the
Backblocks it may be said that the “Tingira” is moored in
Rose Bay, Port Jackson.
Aboard the “Tingira” Jack, Will and Tom Cornstalk are made into
Sailors, and taught to be “Handy-Men.” In fine, shaped into
the.makings of good all-round men, capable of holding their
own on Sea or Land.
Discipline builds up in them habits of Promptitude and Exactness,
and so enhances Jack, Will and Tom’s Value as units in this
virile young Commonwealth.
Early next } r ear, the arrival of the “Australia,” “Sydney” and “Mel-

Split-Lip. Hump & Co.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You of the sea-side cities,
You where the rivers flow,
What do you know of the camels,
And what of the roads they go?
THUS sings “Gilrooney,” Australia’s
one camel poet, and to his query I
merely add, with some emphasis:
“Aye, what DO you know of the camels;
and what of the roads they go?”
Only they who have seen him at his
best —seen him at home on his beloved
wastes; seen him trudging the long, lone
pathway that mostly leads right down a
street of golden light into the eye of the
setting sun ; seen him humping his burdens
under blazing skies, across shoreless seas of
sand; seen him amid the wastes of
rock and spinifex that lie beyond Olon-
curry, or among the treeless sand-
dunes that lie beyond Eyre; seen him
far out upon the hopeless tracts
ot sun-smitten clay-plain and dazzling
salt-pan country that lie beyond Ivalgoorlie;
living and earning his scanty mulga-bush in
regions where scarce another of God’s crea-
tures can find subsistence—have any idea
what the camel has done for Australia,
or what a debt Australians owe the lean,
grey beast that is a slave and an alien in this
Land.
Lhe first camels to take part in the de-
velopment of. Australia were those which
carried and laid out the wire and galvanised
iron poles for the transcontinental telegraph
m places where no other means of transport
could be used. This was in the 60’s of last
century. Since then, incidentally and be-
tween whiles, the greyish beast has still been
connected with the line, humping wool in
from, and merchandise out to, the border-
stations ; keping rations in the stomachs and
hope m the hearts of the men who operate
the long, thin wire that goes out God knows
how many miles north from Hergott.
Since the completion of the O. T. line
camels have had a hump in all the big
things that ever took place in the interior of
the continent; and they have been in almost
every hole and corner of it. They laid the
telegraph round the Australian Bight to
Es per a nee—gazing calm-eyed superciliousness
from the cliff-brows west of Eucla, where sea
and sand-plain meet, upon the vast expanse
of restless water that stretches toward Tas-
mania and the South Pole. Tliev just took
the roof of the Southern Ocean for the limit-
less grey desert it seemed to be, and regaided
it in the light of an old friend. They knelt for
loading in Southern Cross, and dry-nursed
Coolgardie in its youngest days ; and there
wasn’t a man living who knew that road and
the horrors of it in the days before the rail-
way who hadn’t a good word and a warm
spot in his heart for the luckless “oonfc.” He
opened up Tarcoola, and in Arltunga he wit-
nessed the white man’s greed for gold. Law-
lers has seen him. Day Dawn, Nullagine
and Cobar know him well. And in the days
when Broken Hill was young the shadow of
his hump was large across the Barrier. He
worked on more telegraph lines in Westralia,
swaying north with material as far as
Broome. He humped wool from Tibooburra
to Bourke, and from Tilpa to Menindie; and
for back-loading took artesian boring plants,
pianos, flour and sundries for stations beyond
the Cooper. To him most far-out holdings
simply owed existence. Times without num-
ber he has stood between pioneers and the
starkness of thirst and hunger. He has
humped “the Last Chance”—men, sick unto
death of fever —from many a mining camp
to the nearest railhead, even as he humped
in the long past other dying men—Burke
and Grey, and Wills ; and as he bore my old
friend, Frank George, from the Petermann
Ranges, 400 miles, to his grave at Alice
Springs. lie lifted silver ore at Tarra-
wnigee; copper matte at old Cloncurry; and
at O.lv. he carted coke, and copper ore, and
ilux, and other material that was hard ana
heavy, until traction engines came and re-
lieved him of his job ; and a job that a trac-
tion engine has to relieve one of isn’t usually
a very easy one. Mount Garnet saw him in
its prime, when he worked on charcoal and
flux and copper ore; and Laverton, and
Burketown, and Lake Way, and Birdsville
all know him well. And they never knew
him without a burden on his back and an
expression in his whole attitude that de-
noted strict attention to business. Then
when business got slack, and when he wasn’t
sure how liis spare time could be best em-
nloyed, he went out and built the Border
Fence.
Now, anyone who does not know the Bor-
der Fence has no conception of the magni-
tude of the work. Next, after the laying and
building of the two transcontinental tele-
graph lines, the transcontinental fence was
the biggest job that Split-Lip, Hump and Co.
took part in. Beginning on the Murray,
wire, posts and coils of netting were laid in
the straight line north for 350 miles, mostly
through No Man’s Land, to the nor’-west
corner of N.S.W., thence still north for 200
miles more to the corner known as Haddon.
There the fence went westward for 200 miles
to the angle which is west of Birdsville —in
a region where no man liveth, and where the
sun rises out of desolation and illimitable
leagues of sand, and sets amid more sand and
a despondency almost greater than a human
heart can bear. From that point the fence
goes north again, 400 miles to Camooweal
and beyond. And camels not only helped to
build this great barrier but are being used to-
day in the maintenance of it. Finally came
the copper boom and the concentration of
camels upon Cloncurry, and it was there the
writer learned to know the big grey meat-
shadows best.
Of all possible kinds of loading copper-ore
is the best. Its great weight, its compact-
ness, and its immunity from damage in tran-
sit make it in high demand among packers
and carriers. Thus, with the unusual out-
put of ore consequent upon the high price of
the metal in 1906-7, and with the railhead
still 200 miles away across a sea of Mitchell

it GOOD of me? ”
grass, those years saw an influx of beasts to
that field which was unprecedented in the
camel-history of this continent. To the
feast, like vultures from the blue, long trains
of camels seemed fairly to drop from the
monstrous arc of the sky.
They came from far-off Port Augusta by
the southern sea, more than 1000 miles away.
They blew up with the cool south breeze
from Bourke and Milparinka and Wilcannia
and Ilergott Springs (which is the home of
camels), tramping the long, long road that
lies by Boulia. Even from remote Ivalgoor-
lie and the mining fields round Norseman
long trains swung out with drifting gait, a
rythmic creaking of empty saddles, and a
soft “kush-kush” of cushioned feet on sand—
serenely entering on a journey that lay mid-
way across a continent to join the throng
that was converging on Cloncurry, for the
hawk-nosed Afghan had smelt the copper-
harvest from afar.
At Cloncurry the camel found a new and
quite strange home, and the humphy toiler
piled up another score. Heretofore we had
seen him working only on the level lands; or
the flat-horizoned seas of sand that lie along
the Border Fence; on the dreary' mulga
wastes that in Westralia seem to have no
end; amid the sandhills back o’ Bourke;
and on the treeless limestone plains that lie
beyond the Cooper. Now we see him in an-
other phase, toiling through rocky defiles
where all the earth is torn in ragged hills.
We see him in trains, like great, grey snakes,
winding down steep, stony valleys; lifting
burdens of copper ore from claims among the
mountains, where waggon wheels would
never dare to go. We meet him under all con-
ditions, and in all kinds of unlikely places—•
in the bend of a pad where a siding is cut
across the shoulder of a range, where only
spinifex and gnarled turpentine-bushes find
root among the rocks, and where the view-
looks out on' a wilderness of hills; or in
the water-worn gut of a ravine. He is found
shuffling down a stony creek-bed which lies
almost in perpetual shade because of a preci-
pice that overhangs it; grumbling lowly to
himself because the load is heavy, and the
way is rough and hard, and his feet are sore
—cursing, doubtless, in camel language the
greed of man which drives him on ; or apos-
trophising,_ maybe, the rubbly stones that roll
beneath his pads. And, anon, he may be
seen from afar off, like a great grey ant
against the skyline of a range.
. Stone-bruised and saddle-sore, hundreds of
him are lifting ore to-day from the mountains
along the watershed; from Will’s Creek;
from the Upper Corella, where the bald
schist hills, serrated like the teeth of a
cross-cut saw, have defied anything that
went on wheels; from trap-rock fastnesses
of UK.Upper Dugald; from Vwctora;
from the Dobbin; and from far-out Oxide,
And it was from Mount Oxide that the
camels of Cloncurry did their heaviest work ;
for in its opening years this great mine was
the biggest pack-transport proposition that
Australia ever saw. And anyone who
knows that country—who knows the hopeless
inaccessibility of the Upper Leichhardt, or
of Charley’s Creek, or of the Corella, or of
the hills behind Mount Cuthbert, and who
has seen and understood what the great un-
gainly beast has done for Australia s new-est
mining field, won’t hesitate to lift his hat
to a big, grey camel.
SYDNEY E. PEARSON.
The Transmogrification.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE broke the seal of the big, 16-ton-
capacity “V” van, and slid the
door open on its bars with a rush.
Bill Hopley coughed. Crawley bent himself
up in torture, and I emptied my body of the
last breath it had taken in.
“Holy Fly!” ejaculated Hopley, with
vehement faintness.
“What’s the matter?” anxiously asked the
little white-faced, sanctimonious tallv-clerk,
hurrying up with his paraphernalia. He
stuck his nose into the awful smell, which
was an invisible solid, and went whiter than
ever. Then yellow came into his face.
Chinaman stuff,” he said, backing away
from that world-beating smell. “Keep the
brands together on the floor as best you
can. I’m not very good on Chinee marks;
111 slip along to the office for information.”
-the tally-clerk was delivering himself
ot false views. He was well versed in all
the hieroglyphics of transport identification,
but the smell of the goods had got him down.
Bill Hopley was “breaker-out” of the
gang, and it was his duty to enter the truck
and load our
barrows. It
was some time
before he could
persuade him-
self to go even
to the outer
edge of the
smell-zone. At
last, after in-
dulging in lan-
guage which
my machine
refuses to
type, he sud-
denly attacked
the contents of
the van. He
had an accident
with the first
article. One of
those stone
jars, lopsided,
and half-encased
in a cane bas-
ket, missed his
grip, and
bumped on the
floor. A little
triangu-
lar piece flew
out of the jar,
and a thick,
dark liquid
welled up.
We lugged the vessel out on the floor,
and held an inquiry. Curiosity overcame
us, else the subtle influence of Cathay was
already at work. I tasted the stuff' with
my finger, and said it was like burnt sugar.
Crawley followed by example. “Tastes like
chin potatoes,” he said.
“Tastes like the devil,” said Bill Hopley,
with his usual violence. Then he looked at
the ooze critically; dipped his finger in and
sucked it thoughtfully. A strange silence
and suavity came upon him.
Crawley had recovered the little three-
sided chip, and was about to replace it,
when Hopley stopped him. “Wait a second,”
he said, and ran for his billy. He filled it
with the Chinese liquid and sipped a little.
We looked at him distrustfully, and gave
vent to a few sarcastic remarks. Bill only
smiled oddly, and went back to the truck,
which he entered without even cursing the
stench. Later, we saw him diving into
various baskets of Chinese vile goods, saw
him chewing yam-like vegetables and long,
curvy scales that looked like Chinese finger-
nails. Bill seemed to be blandly enjoying
himself on the ullaged property.
“The dirty scoundrel!” observed Crawley,
forcibly.
Then a climax came. Outside the Goods
Shed door a filthy Chinaman drove by in a
ricketty spring-cart. “I think I know that
fellow,” cried Bill. “I’ll have a look.” He
deserted his work, grabbed his hat, coat and
billy, and ran after the Chow in the ancient
vehicle. Amazed, we watched him catch un
and stop the cart. Next minute he had
climbed in, and the pair drove away like
the happy brothers the parsons tell us we
ought to be. The rest of us almost perished
with amazement. Never before did we
know Bill to have Chinese acquaintances.
“The cow that associates with a pigtail,”
Crawley ripped out disgustedly, “is no
friend of mine.” But he didn’t say it with
the old energy, and his words lacked some-
thing of conviction.
Of course, we could not ignore a certain
claim Bill Hopley had on our friendship.
When the white-livered tally-clerk came back
the truck was empty, and the smell thinned
out. We told him that Bill had been over-
come with the Celestial fumes, and had gone
home ill. The lie strained our tongues, but
Bill had been a good pal.
* * * *
Hopley didn’t turn up the next day, nor
the next, and on the third evening we called
round after tea to remonstrate with him.
We were met at the door by Bill’s wife.
There was fury and anxiety shining out of
both her eyes at once.
“What’s wrong with Bill?” she demanded
before we could speak. “Where is he?”
“Ain’t he home?” asked Crawley.
“Home! No, he ain’t. He came home
Monday afternoon with a billyful of dirty
treacle-stuff, an’ a parcel. He drank some
of the dirty stuff for his tea, an’ what d’you
think he had in the parcel? A suit of sloppy
silk Chinese pyjama-things. I told him I
wouldn’t stay in the house if he wore them.
Fancy him wearin’ them beastly thimrs an’
so down on Chows ! Why, hewouldn't
f a m a u Ca^^age once bought off a John an’

Bill and I had seen Mrs. Hoplev ao into
a Chow shop one Saturday night, and buv a
hetaste'd if at S? d aftei ™ds that when
ne mated it at the Sunday dinner, he spat it
out and said it was Ghinaman-cabbage Mrs
Sid- e “T>nnVi rf- 11 ’ 1 ’ a £? Bm bad sternly
said. Don t tell lies. D yer think T don’t-
davor of Chinaman-cabbage’”
And where is Bill now?” I asked re-
U “TPh? to the inatter of immediate interest.

his silk pyjamas! No, I don’t know where

cleared 0 ’ 1 ’ 11 ' SaVed up thirty -three quid and
This was Bill Ilopley in a new light The
case was now serious. We promised Mrs.
Hopley to look up all the old haunts, and see
it we could lay hands on the defaulting hus-
band. But Bill s old haunts were all cheap
there wasn t one of them in which a sane
man could possibly require £33 and a
Chinese dressing-gown. Could it be that
William was mad or a secret opium-eater’
Crawley and I planned our search system-
iiticaHy. Each took a different street every
night for a week, and poked an inquiring
nose into every conceivable hole and corner
At the end of the seven days we had beaten
up every pub and back lane we could find
and looked in at every window which we
could reach. And nothing had come of it all
But the following night a surprise turned
up. Crawley rushed up to me and dragged
me away by the arm.
( ‘‘l’U swear it’s -Bill,” he cried excitedly.
i was just peeping in out of curiosity when
1 spotted him. I run for you.”
Almost out of breath, he dragged me away
down some dark streets into one gloomv lane
that reeked of Chows. In front of an in-
fernal den that was meant for a shop he
came to a standstill, and told me to look
in.
I came prepared for a shock, but never will
1 forget the cold shiver that ran down my
back Behind the murky counter stood Bill
I lopley.. At that moment I was prepared to
swear it was Bill Hopley, but—it was a
Chinaman.
We stopped opposite the person behind the
counter. The Chinaman looked up at us
and smiled. It was Bill for certain —his
?? e Ar. his nos e—bis chin—-but.. .A CHINA-
MAN !
“Alesame buy?” he asked, cozening one
yellow paw on the other. “Buy gleen tea?
Two shillun one pong gleen tea. Welly ni’
gleen tea.”
The White Australia in my blood couldn’t
stand the strain. “Come out of here,” I
said fiercely to Crawley, “else I’ll pull the
dirty swine’s head off.”
“There’s only one judge of this,” I said
outside. “We’ll fetch his missus.
“And bring that favorite meershaum pipe
°f.ms,” suggested Crawley. “He’ll put him-
self away when he sees it.”
Mrs. Hopley threw on a shawl and hat
and came readily. She didn’t hesitate, but
strode boldly in. Mrs. Hoplev wasn’t given
to timidiiess. She didn’t faint. She just
stood stock-still, and stared.
“You buy, missy?” The bewildering object
behind the counter put on its blandest smile,
and produced a gaudy feather-duster. “Welly
ni fealler-dust. allesame clean house; make
welly tidv house.”
Mrs. Hopley glared dangerously. She
came a step nearer and hissed: “You come
home, you rotter, an’ I’ll make you tidy.”
There was a perplexed look on the yellow
heathen face.
“You come home, you pig!”
“Whaffor? Me home, missy.”
Mrs. Hopley advanced and placed Bill’s
favorite pipe on the counter. “There’s yer
best pipe that I planted for spittin’ on me
floor. Now you come quietly home. Bill.”
“Me home, missy,” repeated the Chinaman,
without the least sign of recognising the
pipe. Suddenly he jabbered out something
m a foreign tongue, and a grunt came from
behind a filthy curtain. Then from the direc-
tion of the grunt, an old, wizened Chow
appeared, blinking.
“My welly fine farler!”
His father!' Mrs. Hoplev stood thunder-
struck. I slipped up and led her out in a
dazed fashion.
“I’m sorry,” I said. “We’ve made a hor-
rible bloomer.”
Outside, she stopped, and although I urged
her to go home, she wouldn’t budge. “There’s
something wrong,” she said. “Let me think.”
Presently she wrenched herself free. “It
is him!” she hissed. “Look at that sign-
board !” And before we could interfere, she
had dashed into the shop again.
With one accord, we turned our attention
upward. Looking down at us like a night-
mare was the legend :
HOP LEE & SON,
GROCERS.
Frightful cries and frenzied “Whaffors”
came from within. Then a jumbled heap of
protesting Chow w T as precipitated upon the
pavement. The heap was snatched up and
set. on its feet by an infuriated female, and
whirled out. of sight down the gloomy lane.
The last thing that came to our ears was:
“I’ll give you a clean house an’ feather
dusters, you rotter!”
* * * *
Bill Hopley turned up to work about a
week later, clothed and in his right dunga-
rees. There were no longer any traces of the
Chinaman about him, and he reported to the
boss that he had been laid up with fever.
Crawley and I sneaked round to Mrs. Hop-
ley at the first favorable opportunity, to ask
how Bill had explained his lapse into China-
dom, and how he had gradually developed
back into his old self. And to our wild as-
tonishment Mrs. Hopley refused to discuss
the matter.
This was too much. We went straight to
the shop where we had discovered Bill, re-
solved to shake that bogus parent, Hop Lee,
until he revealed the true inwardness of this
witchcraft. But old Hop Lee was gone.
More wonderful still, the shop was gone also,
or it had become indistinguishable and estab-
lished an alibi by hiding itself among the
other shops and looking exactly like them.
I firmly believe old Hop had taken the
premises under his arm and started back to
China.
At long last Crawley screwed up his cour-
age and asked Bill for particulars. Bill
flatlv denied having ever been absent from
work, and he smote Crawley with a batten.

A faulty memory means loss of money and the power it brings, loss of
position, loss of prestige and standing. It means inability to take advan-
tage of your experiences; it means FAILURE in everything you undertake.
Success is the result of hard work and careful consideration of the little
things. You may have the capacity for hard work, but unless your
memory will AT ONCE recall everything, no matter how trivial, pertaining
to the matter in hand, your hard work will go for nought, and the other
man will beat you.
NATURAL MEMORY: And yet your natural memory, if subjected to proper training
for a very short period, would serve you so well that you would get the full benefit from your
past experiences and work, and your mind would be alert and resourceful. The Pelman System
of Memory Training is the natural system.. Because it is based on the natural laws of the mind
it is easily understood and acquired. The pupil experiences benefit during the first lesson, and
before the Course is completed his mind works subconsciously on the right lines, and he recalls
facts, figures, ideas, dates, conversations, etc., spontaneously and without effort.
INDIVIDUAL TUITION: Whilst the Pelman System of Memory Training is exceedingly
beneficial in itself, the special needs and requirements of each pupil are carefully considered
and provided for. This individual tuition is a very important factor in the training.
CONCENTRATION: The Pelman Course of Training develops the power of concentration
to a remarkable degree, and entirely removes mind wandering, with its attendant ineffectiveness
and waste of effort. Where necessary, special exercises are set.
TAUGHT BY POST: .The Pelman System of Memory Training is exceedingly interesting
and very simple. It is taught by post in five lessons. Distance is no hindrance whatever to
success. Half an hour’s spare time daily for six weeks completes the Course, although pupils may
take longer if they wish.
For twenty years the Pelman System has been helping thoughtful and ambitious people of all
classes, trades and professions, on the road to success. Write NOW, for free booklet, giving full
particulars of the Pelman System, with Australian and N.Z. opinions, to the Secretary, IHL

Throughout the long year
Martell’s plays its useful and
pleasant part. When the need
arises for a powerful, medicinal spirit
—the wise use Martell’s. When friend
meets friend, and Custom and Amity
are honored —the warm-hearted use
m
Martell’s.
When, at the close of
the happy, convivial
meal, the liqueur is
sipped—the refined use
Martell’s. When Christ-
mas throws its mantle
of festival over all, this
generous, time-honored
spirit is particularly ap-
propriate.

ARE
YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery* or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them —the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle "could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
IQ
ftP
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t deiay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

Two Machines for Raising
SAW MILL EFFICIENCY
If you are not making enough profit you ought to determine
why. Mostly it’s inefficient or obsolete plant that’s the reason.
If your manufacturing expenses are too high, get acquainted
with what a “Waterous” band mill will do to give you increased
production at the same rate of “overhead” expense now ruling.
A Planer by S. A. Woods is a wonderful production unit, too.
This machine can cut up to 300 feet a day—with one man
feeding. There’s not a lost moment to pay for.
Write and let our Mill-efficiency expert send you further infor-
mation. He’s had 30 years studying the problem of produc-
tion.
