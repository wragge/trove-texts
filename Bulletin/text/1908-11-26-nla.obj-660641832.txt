AN AUSTRALAISE.
Train ye your pop-guns, brothers, now,
Upon the swart in vader’s brow !
Arise ! Hup, there ! And when the morn
Of battle dawhs, though we are shorn
Of armored strength, we’ll hope to score
Against the'pest that nears our shore.
Hooroar /
Tread on ’em, now, Austrailyer !
Do ’em or die, Austrailyer mine !
Now shall thb flare of glory shine
Upon our men of gory craft!
Each grand, old, buzzing battle-raft
Must ncnv pursue her dreadful way
To welt the foe in Hobson’s Bay !
Hooray /
Tread on ’em now, Austrailyer !
Bring up the guns—the good old guns
With which poor gran’pa taught his sons
The art of blood ! When war-steeds prance
Let Blossom and old Jane advance,
And when the foeman’s bugles blow
See us to crimson carnage go !
What ho!
Shove out the guns, Austrailyer !
The scarlet on our leader’s chest
Glows warm above his woollen vest,
And splendid young lieutenants blaze
Within the flame-stabbed battle-haze ...
TFe’ll wallop ’em all right, to-day
Somehow —or so the papers say—
HooRAY !
Hoo-blanky-rny ! Austrailyer !

Syme.
IT is probably yet too early to estimate
the place that David Syme, who was
The Age, occupies in the develop-
ment of Australia; but Ambrose Pratt
has attempted the task with considerable
success. The name of the biographer,
with characteristic modesty, does not ap-
pear on the paper cover that for sale
purposes enshrouds the volume ; it is
omitted to give prominence to the intro-
duction by Alfred Deakin. Deakin
admits not having read the whole of the
book, and is affably non-committal as to
its contents. To Syme this great tribute
is paid by Deakin :
The reputation of his paper was dearer to
him than wealth, and perhaps dearer than
life. Because he was a man of this type, he
takes his place among the greatest person-
alities who have made the Australia of 1908
and in a large measure continue to shape its
coming destinies. For my own part, I re-
member among the a no more masterful, no
more influential figure.
David Syme was a piece of quartz,
with veins of gold beneath. His life
from infancy made him hard, yet it did
not prevent him from being human.
His boyhood in Scotland certainly shaped
the man. His father, a poor school-
master, was a dour, harsh Scot, who
never smiled on his son. David Syme
has no recollection of ever having ad-
dressed him directly in his life, even to
the extent of asking him a question. If
the idea of ever doing so entered his
head, the boy never had the courage to
carry it out. He had to do what he was
told, and ask no questions. And the boy
did not remember a single complimentary
remark ever addressed to him by his sire.
He and his brothers were allowed no
time for play. They had no holidays,
no sports. They began their studies at
seven and continued them till eight
at night. But the Sundays were the
worst. They had to attend all the
church-services available, and spent the
Sabbath evening reading devotional
books, such as The Life of the Lev. John
Netvton (whoever he was) or Jonathan
Edwards upon The Will. David, left at
home when his brothers went to the uni-
versity, secretly taught himself naviga-
tion, with the idea of running off to sea.
Then, on his father’s death, David stud-
i«d theology and languages, his ambition
at that time being to become an Oriental
linguist. He studied theology at Heidel-
berg, but the more he studied it the less
he believed in it, and, returning to Glas-
gow, tooka job as “reader” on a newspaper.
But David could see no future for himself
in journalism in Glasgow, and lit out for
the Californian goldfields. Here he had
little luck, and moved on to Australia
as a miner, landing in Melbourne
with hardly any cash in his pocket.
He made a little money at mining, but
bis claim was unjustly jumped, and, after
waiting patiently for redress from the
Government, Syme sold the claim and
left. Had he kept alive his claim against
the Government he and his partners
would have been able to demand some-
thing like a million sterling compensa-
tion ; for that claim, afterwards known as
the Great Mount Egerton mine, has up
to the present turned out, in profits and
dividends, more than But
nothing would have stopped David Syme
from getting rich—somehow. The peculi-
arity in his case was that he became rich
honestly.
Syme’s brother, Ebenezer, was at that
time the editor of The Age. The Age was
a financial failure, but it threw all its
lack of influence on the side of the miners
at the Eureka Stockade fight. Its first
proprietors withdrew from the paper, and
the editorial staff continued it for eighteen
months; then The Age was sold, and the
two brothers bought it for £2OOO. 'David
went into this speculation without en-
thusiasm, and solely on his brother’s
advice. After a trial, the brothers found
that the paper would not support both of
them, and David withdrew. He started con-
tracting, but met trouble from the estab-
lished tirmsand theGovernmentengineers.
David was just beginning to see his way
to success when Ebenezer died. Again,
against his will, he was forced into
journalism. The Age was unsaleable, but
he had certain views which he believed
it to be his duty to force upon the public.
So, practically without means, he set to
work to manage and edit his paper. For
ten years lie worked fifteen hours a day.
As to his'Protectionist views, Syme says:
Not only did The Age at that period stand
alone as an advocate of Protection, but I
recollect the time when I myself stood alone
as a Protectionist. I knew of no one in
Australia who believed in Protection except
myself. Others may have held the same
views, but they were unknown to me. Pro-
tection, therefore, was not adopted by The
Age because it was popular, or because it
was profitable, for it was neither. I had to
fight for it inch by inch from the start, and
against immense odds, as the whole com-
munity, myself included, had been reared
on Freetrade pabulum, and thoroughly be-
lieved in the cult.
And what a glorious victory that man
has won ! Among those who were con-
verted to Protectionist views by The Age
were James McCulloch, George Higin-
botham, Prof. Pearson, and Richard
Seddon.
v)/
Pratt details the series of struggles the
paper had on the land question, the con-
stitutional issue, railway extravagance,
democratic legislation, and federation.
Again and again the fat men determined
to destroy David Syme. The large
stomach chiefly used the boycott. The
mercantile, financial and pastoral fat men
simultaneously withdrew all their adver-
tisements. In a single day the journal
shrank to half its size, and had to depend
solely upon its circulation. Syme reduced
its price from sixpence to threepence, and
by rigid economy managed to exist,
strenuously fighting against the land
monopoly and Freetrade. The Govern-
ment also refused its advertisements to
the journal. Syme reduced the price of
his paper to twopence and fought the
harder, his back to the wall. After four
years of struggle Syme saw, at the
general election of 1864, the return of a
large majority of members pledged to
secure Protection to Australian indust-
ries.
v!/
Pratt furnishes an interesting and con-
vincing series of statistics to prove, by
comparison with partially Freetrade
N.S.W., the prosperity that Protection
ensured to Victoria. ‘‘The greatest libel
action of modern times, 5 ’ Speight v. Syme,
is summed up by Pratt in these terms :
The country was saved an expenditure of
more than £41,000,000 on useless railways,
not one of which has since been constructed ;
economies were instituted in railway man-
agement amounting to several hundreds of
thousands per annum; and David Syme
[the victor] lost £50,000 [in law costs].
And The Age had won its way to
financial success.
One of the most interesting chapters is
devoted to Newspaper Government, and
the remarkable autocracy exercised by
The Age. But for the general reader the
personal aspect of Syme will prove more
attractive. The stern, straight character
of Syme is seen in the following anecdote :
He once declared war against a popular
politician. An unexpiated, unrepented act
of meanness was the cause of strife. Pre-
sently there came to Syme a person whom
this man had injured, with authentic proofs
of a shameful private transaction the publi-
cation of which would have brought about
instant ruin. Syme bought the papers and
posted them to his enemy the day following
a rabid attack upon him by the politician
under cloak of Parliamentary privilege. This
act of generosity brought the politician to
The Age office, with protestations of grati-
tude and offers of reconciliation. Syme
refused to receive him, and never rested
until he had driven the man out of political
life.
As an employer, Syme’s consideration
was shown when he decided to install
linotypes in his machine-rooms. His
decision displaced more than a hundred
compositors, but, though it took him
two years, he provided for every one of
them. He pensioned a number, and
found employment for the rest. He set
several up in independent businesses, and
helped many to settle on the land. He
had an agricultural expert travelling
about the country for three months
to find suitable farms for those
who wished to go on the,land. His
unobtrusiveness is illustrated by the
incident on a holiday during which the
office was closed, when Syme was turned
back from the editor’s room by the office
watchman. Rather than reveal his
identity to his own servant, he turned
and left the building.
The biography is necessarily enthusi-
astic, the harsher side of Syme’s character
being little in evidence ; but it furnishes
a valuable account of the life-work of a
remarkable personality, a stern, honest,
patriotic Australian.
Conrad.
Conrad is clouding over. The dreadful
suspicion of dulness is creeping over him.
He is prosperous and accepted and settled
for life. As has been hinted before, he has
married his art, and his art is taking to
coming down to breakfast in a dressing-
jacket and with her front hair barricaded with
Hindes. Even the title of his new collec-
tion of contes betrays the weariness of the
much-married. A Set of Six (Methuen) does
not stir the soul as Tales of Unrest or
Typhoon stirred it a decade ago. And of the
six long short-stories, two are dismally dull;
one (“The Duel”) is dull in patches, but
ends with a duel of intense interest- —a flash
of the old Conrad manner ; one is a return
to the South America that he knows so
intimately; and one (“ II Conde ”) is mere
weariness, the Conrad subtlety and precision
without the Conrad inspiration. “The
Duel ’’ has a big theme, admirably developed,
but spun out to a length altpgether excessive.
It is only in “ The Brute,” a tale of the sea,
that Conrad returns to his own province with
his old strength. The Brute is a ship that
is mad. . •
“Why not? Why couldn’t there be
something in her build, in her lines cor-
responding to —‘What’s madness ? Only
something just a tiny bit wrong in the make
of your brain. Why shouldn’t there be a
mad ship—l mean mad in a ship-like way,
so that under no circumstances could you be
sure she would do what any other sensible
ship would naturally do for you. There are
ships that steer wildly, and ships that can’t
be quite trusted always to stay. . . But
then you expect her to be always so. You
take it as part of her character,, as a ship,
just as you take account of a man s peculiari-
ties of temper when you deal with him. But
with her you couldn’t. She was unaccount-
able. If she wasn’t mad, then she was the
most evil-minded, underhand, savage brute
that ever went afloat. I’ve seen her run in
a heavy gale beautifully for two days, and
on the third broach-to twice in the same
afternoon. The first time she flung the
helmsman clean over the wheel, but as she
didn’t quite manage to kill him she, had
another try about three hours afterwards. . .
When we mustered the crew there was one
man missing. . . Somehow, when I think
of her I can’t help remembering what we
hear of incurable lunatics breaking loose
now and then.”
This ship acquires the habit of killing a
man every trip, and caps her reputation by
killing a girl in a very dreadful manner, de-
scribed with Conrad’s marvellous visualising
power. For Conrad writes with his eyes.
Every scene he sets before you he patiently
and precisely describes, viewing it, as it
were, by a mental'limelight of extraordinary
brilliancy. The climax of the story of “The
Brute ” comes with the death of the captain’s
niece.
\l>
“My heart flew up right into my throat,
but not before I had time to yell out; ‘ Jump
clear of that anchor ! ’
‘‘ I don’t suppose she heard me at all. The
first touch of the hawser against the fluke
threw her down ; she was up on her feet
again quick as lightning, but she was up on
the wrong side. I heard a horrid, scraping
sound, and then that anchor, tipping over,
rose up like something alive; its great, rough
iron arm caught Maggie round the waist,
seemed to clasp her close with a dreadful hug,
and flung itself with her over and down in a
terrific clang of iron, followed by heavy
ringing blows that shook the ship from stem
to fTtern—because the ring stopper held ! ”
This is the old Conrad ; but there is too
little of that retired sailorman in this insipid
collection of sketches. Nothing further
of real importance is now to be expected of
Joseph Conrad. He will go on writing, of
course, and maybe he will have another
“Youth” or “Typhoon” for us, but they
will be but flashes in a pan of conscientious
dreariness.
—— «
Had P. Stewart not put up prominently a
notice-board warning off trespassers, we
should have felt inclined to criticise his
Australian Tales and Verses (a new edition,
with additional poems, Lothian, Melb.,
2s. 6d.). Happily for his own peace of
mind, his notice to trespassers is plain to
read :
Not for to-day
In Nature’s way
I write upon the scroll of Time,
’Tis for the morn,
And those unborn.
Who best shall judge my gentle rhyme.
Rather than make it clubs, we leave it to
you, posterity.
Stokers and verse-lovers will be pleased to
learn that Will Lawson has in the press
(Gordon and Gotch) a new volume of his
always interesting verse, entitled Stokin and
Other Verses. The contents will include
selections from his two published books of
verse, as well as pieces not yet seen in book-
form.
James Sillars, with his Musings in Maori-
land (Wairarapa Daily Times , M.L.), has
stolen his title from Thomas Bracken.
Sillars announces that he has written eleven
volumes of prose, His serious verse is inept,
as witness his pathos on his dead parents :
Four stone pillars, at the corners,
Bearing each a double chain ;
Stand, like ever present mourners,
Guarding long where they have lain.
And a tall obelisk of granite
Marks the spot where still they lie,
Pointing upward from this planet,
To’the ever changing sky.
And a scroll of gilded marble,
Tells life's story bald and brief,
Ornate with no needless garble,
If not love then not of grief.
Yet in humorous verse he has a light facility
in telling hallowed jokes with neatness and
despatch. It is fair to Sillars’ portrait to
state that the author does not value his
work very highly.
“Gum-Tree,” the author of one of the
Australaises to which a prize was awarded,
is Howell O'Reilly, Sydney Grammar School.
“ Alpar” writes : There is no doubt things in
Australia are taking a change for the better.
When I went to a Public School near Sydney, a
year or two ago, we used to sing “ the Men o
Harlech ” (made in Germany) every day ot our
lives, until we were black in the face, ine oici
Skulldriver was a man from Frankfort, and he
used to give us to understand that Kaiser Bill was
the greatest man on earth. A few of us actually
began to believe that William was something to
rave about. One day Schooley asked us all to
take off our hats to. a picture of Wilhelm he slung
over the playground fence ; and a pal ot mine,
whom I have since learned to respect, took eignt
savage cuts, like a good Australian, for refusing.
Just lately, our teachers have been instructed by
their inspectors to take up Australian poetry ana
song in the schools; and they have started on
such songs as “ Advance Australia 1' air, which is
no good to Australia, and “ Australia I air, which
is a lot better. Also, they have taken on Aus-
tralia Hail,” about which there is neither slime nor
froth. We want to take off our hats to Australia
every time, and make fat foreigners, living m it,
go and do likewise. Let us be Australians .

DEBILITATION,
NERVOUSNESS.
HOW HEALTH WAS RESTORED.
“ When I first made the acquaintance of
Clements Tonic, some twelve years since, I was
living in Croydon,” said Mrs. Edith Browne, of 63
Mount Vernon Street, Forest Lodge, “and my
memory is so clear concerning the details of my
illness that it seems only yesterday that I threw
all my infirmities away.”
“If you don’t mind, I’d like you to give me an
outline of your sufferings,” remarked the writer.
“ How long were you ailing? ”
“Quite eighteen months, and during that time
I was treated by several doctors, besides being an
indoor patient of a hospital for six weeks, from
which institution 1 returned home as bad as ever,
and it really seemed to me that I was never going
to get well again. For a mother with a young
family to be in such a plight as I was in is enough
to break one’s heart to contemplate, and my prin-
cipal reason for giving my experiences for public
circulation is that I hope to assist other women in
throwing off their ailments, as I did. My nerves
were in a shockingly bad state —fairly jangling
together.”
“ Did the doctors say what was wrong with
you, Mrs. Browne?”
“ They said I was dyspeptic, and greatly debili-
tated, and well I know it. I might say I was
so feaxsome that even my own shadow frightened
me. Oh !it was a wretched condition to be in,
with nothing but worry and trouble, and suffering
for my daily companions. But I believe nervous-
ness to have been the most awful bane of my life.
You’ve no idea how I was. The imaginations
that filled my brain were simply hideous. They
actually made me shudder. If I slept at all, whieh
was very seldom, I would wake up from dreams
that were ugly in the extreme—always fraught
with circumstances and happenings of a dreadful
nature, and I’d find myself shaking from head to
foot. I’d be afraid of falling asleep again, because
those dreams were too terrible to bear repetition.
During both day and night I always had an idea
that somebody was standing at the back of me,
with some evil object, of course ; and to tell you
the truth, my life was unbearable. For six
months I could take only the lightest of food, and ;
very little of that, so you may conjecture that I
diminished in weight a good deal.” v
“Do you require to exercise discretion over
your food now ? ”
“No, indeed ; not sines Clements Tonic cured
me years ago, have I had to bother about what I
ate, or what I left alone, for it made my digestion
so sound that it doesn’t matter what I take, as I
can digest all foods readily, and that means every-
thing to a person’s health. If you can eat well, and
digest your food, there is nothing wrong. That is
my experience, at any rate, and so long as I can
do that I shall continue to be the healthy and
contented woman that Clements Tonic has made
me. Up to the time of starting w'ith that remedy,
I suffered from sharp pains, which ran from my
chest right through to my back. I was never
without them ; also headaches and giddiness, and
I don’t suppose a woman ever lived who was more
fretful than I used to be. Often, without any
cause, I would go and shut myself in .my room, and
cry for hours. And I was given to fainting houts
as well. All of a sudden a quivering sensation
would pass through me, and off Pd go. Oh ! often
I wished myself dead, and away from my afflic-
tions ; but now, thank God, I want to live as long
ss I can, to enjoy the many charms in this world
that are visible only to those in good health. My
gratitude to Clements Tonic for raising me up
when nothing else could, will last as long as there
is breath in my body, and so till then shall I
always advise other sufferers to use the same
remedy, for I am firmly convinced there is no-
thing to approach Clements Tonic for curing the
ills I have mentioned. To me it was perfection.
It drove away those headaches, it completely
abolished the pains from the various parts of my
body, the fits of giddiness and faintness have died
years ago, my nights became restful, and—yes,
happiest achievement of all, my nervousness was
entirely banished. So publish these facts in any
way you prefer.”

A gentleman residing at Dunedin,
N.Z., writes under date Jan. 7,1907:
“It is with gratitude I write you that I
have now a splendid head of hair, both thick
and very soft, all owing to my having used
your wonderful Hair V igor. I was almost
bald headed before I used the Hair Vigor. I
still use it once a day, rubbing it well into the
roots of the hair. I used to wear a skull-cap,
and I am very grateful to Ayer’s Hair Vigor
for the improvement it has made in my looks.”
Be warned in time. Use Ayer’s

had to undergo a very seri-

her weak and ill. The re-
sults of SCOTT’S Emul-

pectations, for my daughter

owes her good

ABOVE IS THE PROOF IN THE FACTS.
HERE IS PROOF IN THE REASON WHY :
SCOTT’S Emulsion easily demonstrates
its superiority over all competitive emul-
sions when put to the test of actual trial.
The test is in the cure—the hard work is
in the laboratory. The materials selec-
ted are always the very best, and the
SCOTT process is the result of long and
painstaking experiment; it has never
been rivalled. This is why SCOTT’S
has an unchallenged record of cures.
Therefore, when purchasing, don’t ask
for “ Emulsion; ” ask for and get

cure for you !

VAROIUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An Old Tune.
When I hear the Old Tune sound,
So sweet, yet void of art,
As a grass-blade through the ground.
It pierces through my heart.
0, it pierces through my heart,
The tune without a name,
Like a magic elfin dart,
An arrow of green flame.
And once more, with spirit-glance,
I behold the boys so gay,
And the dark-eyed colleens, danco
Upon the moonlit way.
And I hear the piper play
That sweet old Irish tune,
That can thrill my heart to-day,
Beneath the Irish moon.
O, if I were young and free,
With wealth at my command,
I would give it all to be
Once more in Ireland.
V. J. DALEY.
The Challenge of the Sea.
Forever, and ever, and ever.
The call of the windy seas
Comes up from the lonely forelands,
A ghost-voice on the breeze.
The blood in our veins grows restless.
And quickens its crimson speed,
The salt in our blood makes answer,
And we hearken the call and heed.
0, not as a stranger calling,
And not as an alien thing,
Is the voice of the great grey waters,
Or the song that the salt tides sing.
Of old in our father’s islands,
Though bitter the wind or fair,
Or east or west or southward
Or north, the call was there.
They could not sleep who heard it—
The white cry of the North ;
They quitted couch and fireside
And home, and hurried forth.
They could not rest who heard it—
The south wind on the bay ;
They farewelled wife and lover,
And laughing went their way.
The west and east wind called them
To foam-ways white as snow ;
The wizard waters wooed them ;
They could not choose but go.
They slept o’ nights with wonder,
And fared with old romance,
And saw the stars of midnight
In mirrored legions dance.
And we who are their children,
Though born afar we be,
Start up at night to hearken
The challenge of the sea.

The Lost Friend.
We were mothered by the forest and the sky, you
and I—
(Oh, the rock-pent, roaring river ! oh, the cow-
bells and the corn !).
Do you love them still, I wonder —would you like
to be up yonder.
Where the grey bluff stares for ever, sphinx-like,
eastward to the morn ?
For our year began with blossoms, frail and small,
first of all ;
(Oh, the dust and dodder-tangles down a briery-
berry lane !).
Man-of-earth and morning-glory, ringed moons
and dewfall hoary,
Then the first frost on the fodder, and the chest-
nuts ripe again.
Let us eat our bread in sweat of honest toil by the
soil—
In the light of sunsets golden let us learn the
living truth.
Out to meet the wind and weather ! Oh, with
naked hearts together,
In the folk-speech quaint and olden, but to speak
as in our youth !
Come you back, then, unto freedom, oh, my
brother, brave and true,
Back unto the silent mountains, and the life that
once we knew.

Stocking Dreams.
Ah me, the thoughts that memory brings
When days are long and lonely !
And through my aimless wanderings
I’m thinking of you only.
I met you in the cheerless street
One day in rainy weather—
A Pagan and a maiden sweet;
Yet strangers there together !
You held your flounces loftily
To save them from the splashes;
And oh ! the thoughts that came to me
Are Dead Sea fruit and ashes !
Yet when I dream (as good saints do)
A vision sweet and shocking
Comes ceaselessly, my dove, of you—
And two dear feet of stocking !

AN ADDRESS ON THE ADVANTAGES
OF BOGGING IN.
The new Australian Government has been a very
few days in office, and already the Tory press
begins to state, with an air of confidence which may
be pure bluff, or which, again, may be the result
of inside knowledge, that its policy will be largely
a policy of caution or harmless drift. There is
talk of an attempt to pass a very few measures
this session, of an early closing up and a long spell
of rest, and a re-assembling of Parliament about
May or June next year. If that advice—the
prophecies are really meant for advice —is taken,
the party might almost as well commit suicide —
temporary suicide, so to speak. The suggested
policy might answer in the case of a Tory or semi-
Tory leader; it might serve for Reid or Bent or
Joe Cook or Peacock or Iceberg Irvine or
Philp; but the Labor men are differently
situated. They are pledged to go ' alone.
They may support another party in a casual
way, as they supported the Deakin Government,
but they can coalesce with no other party. Labor
wants office badly—at least, The Bulletin hopes
it does, for every party which knows that it has
ideas whereby it can do great good to the country
should have a ravening hunger for office and for a
chance of putting its ideas into practice. And it has
only one way of keeping office when it gets office.
If J oiin Forrest thought he had any lofty ideas he
could get his chance to carry them into effect by
coalescing with Reid or Deakin or almost any-
body—there is nothing in Forrest’s principles to
prevent him joining almost anybody. If Wad-
dell or Peacock or Philp happened to be
afflicted with great political inspirations which he
felt he must carry into effect he could buy a
majority by combining with Wade or Bent or
Kidston. Alfred Deakin is above the average
as a political leader, yet he has coalesced twice,
and may do it a third time. In fact, the casual
leader can connect with a majority by a process
of sale or barter at almost any moment. But the
Labor party doesn’t sell, neither does it barter.
Therefore its only chance of securing a permanent
majority is by making converts, and converts are
not made by a process of somnolence and drift—
commonly called a policy of moderation.
* * * *
The two steady-going lies of the Tory press are
to the effect that Labor is a party of wild fads and
frantic visions, and that it is* also a party which is
incompetent in administration and paralytic in
detail. Therefore, if the Labor Government does
little this session and closes early, and goes
into a long recess, it will give its enemies two
special opportunities. First, the lie about the
party’s frenzied projects and insensate, devices
will be blared all over the country for five or six
months. It will be stated that the Fisher
Government hasn’t committed itself definitely
on many large matters because (a) its projects
are so revolutionary that it hesitates about
putting them before the country, and (b) because
it wants a spell, during which it can devise new
and more desperate assaults on capital and pro-
perty and the marriage-tie and so forth. The two
statements may be contradictory, but a small
thing like that doesn’t trouble the Tory news-
paper. Then, in the second place, it will be
alleged that the new Government has fled into
recess in order that its wretched, incapable and
paralytic administration of the Departments may
be free from Parliamentary criticism. That nar-
rative may not hang together any too well with
the tale that it has gone into recess to prepare
bombs and violent revolutions for next session,
but Tory journalism is superior to small dis-
crepancies of the sort. Obviously, therefore,
the Fisher Government should put all its
goods in the shop window. The only way
in which it can demolish the lie about its
frenzy and incompetence is by showing that, as
regards every important subject now before the
country, it has a vigorous, sane and practicable
policy. If it fails to do this, three-fourths of the
papers of Australia will spend the interval
between sessions in furnishing it with a bogus
policy, and the lie will have a very long start
before the Houses meet again. It isn’t sufficient
for Fisher and his colleagues to stump the coun-
try explaining the party’s intentions ; the inten-
tions that are explained on the stump so often
fail to materialise in Parliament that they count
for little. The great essential is to have a sane,
wise, strong, democratic policy that covers all the
essential matters now before the people—
naval and military defence, compulsory mili-
tary training, graduated land-tax, the find-
ing of money for old age pensions, the taking
over of the Northern Territory, the two
transcontinental railways, the maintenance of
the Monaro capital with a port and 5000 square
miles of Federal country attached, Federal control
of industrial legislation, and the like. It might
seem absurd to put all these items into a pro-
gramme for the fag-end of a short session, but
there is no real reason why a new precedent
shouldn’t be established and the programme for
two sessions be issued simultaneously. By com-
mitting the party up to the neck on all the more
urgent questions of the day, and doing it in a
bold, statesmanlike fashion, the prop would be, to
a great extent, knocked from under two serviceable
Tory lies : Lie No. 1, that the Labor Government
intends mere ignorant insensate revolution ; men-
dacity No. 2, that it has no purpose or capacity at
all save that of securing fid. increase in the wages
of an alleged clod named Bill who is understood
to loaf with a shovel in his hand and consume
much beer.
Nothing that the Fisher Government can do
will win it the support of the Reid and Forrest
followings in the Representatives, though it may
easily secure isolated patches of support from
isolated members of those communities. But with
a strong, comprehensive democratic programme it
might force the unsteady Deakin party to sup-
port it ; for very shame that body could hardly
turn dog on a Government which differed from it
mostly in its resolve to really do the things that
Deakin lingered over or merely viewed with
theoretical approval. But if the men in office
loaf or go slow or let things slide, the enthusiasm
will evaporate ; the unstable Deakin crowd will
have an excuse to fall away on the ground
that affairs are not moving; and the coun-
try, which would turn on them and rend
them for destroying a Ministry that was
doing great things, wouldn’t rend them worth
a cent for destroying a Ministry that merely pro-
posed to do great things. There have been so
many Ministries of that sort that people are
accustomed to them, and they can be upset with
impunity. The Labor Government needs advt.
Therefore, it needs to put all its stock in the
window, and show clearly what the stock is.
Therefore, also, it needs to Bog In and show what
it can do with the stock. For these reasons the
hints about an early closure and a long recess
read like the hints that Hushai gave to Absalom,
wherefore Ahithophel went home in disgust and
hanged himself. On the face of things it seems as
if the recess should be of the shortest, and the
new session should begin almost as soon as the
old one is finished. The recess is the time when
there is no advt. to be gathered, when enthusiasm
cools down, when the Ministry which has to make
its name by doing things can’t Do Things, and
when the Cabinet which requires to create a
reputation by bogging in hasn’t a chance to Bog
In. It is a time when the cold wind of doubt
blows on the shifting soul of the affable Deakin,
and when Bruce Smith breathes unhindered into
the ear of Irvine. In short, it is a good enough
time for the Ministry that has made its name and
secured its majority, but it is a very bad time for
the one with its name and its majority to make.
On 17th August, 1904, the first Labor Ministry,
that of J. C. Watson, went out quietly. Pos-
sibly, considering how much weaker the party
was then than it is now, and how much more
solid were its opponents, it did well to go out
quietly—it is difficult to say. But the position
has changed since 1904. If Labor is defeated now
it should demand a dissolution with a truculent
energy that will upset all precedent, and if it has
to go out without a dissolution it should wreck
most of the furniture in its resistance, and take
the doorpost and as much as it can of the door
with it. In other words, it should go out fight-
ing. Of all the parties in Federal politics it is
the one which has most to hope and least to fear
from a dissolution. It was the only one which
materially gained in strength, so far as concerned
the House of Representatives, at last Federal
election, and with good management it would
almost certainly gain much more extensively at a
new election. The old Freetrade party is so dead
as to be hardly worth considering. The new poli-
tical Horrors-of-Rome party is only in process of
formation. If the Labor Government demon-
strates, by a clear statement of its intentions, that
it has a sane, wise, comprehensive states-
manlike programme, the anti-Socialist crowd
will be laboring heavily over a dead horse.
But all these prospects are dependent on
the adoption of a vigorous policy of Bogging In.
If a drift commences, and the Government does
little this session, and shuts up early, and meets
Parliament again about May and then goes out
quietly when the inevitable defeat comes along,
the situation will be wholly different. Then Labor
will go to the country in 1910 with no special re-
cord and amid no special enthusiasm. It will
have no laurel wreath—only a dead vegetable.
Having missed the chance to impress its policy
upon the people, its policy, so far as a large section of
the community is concerned, will be any old thing
that the anti-Sosh papers care to invent. Labor
will probably gain a seat or two, but its immedi-
ate hope of sweeping the country will have van-
ished. Therefore does The Bulletin repeat the
advice it has already tendered once or twice in
the course of this article, and it implores Labor to
Bog In.
AN AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY.
Australia at present sends abroad about
£2,000,000 annually to pay for petroleum and its
by-products. Of this sum 90 per cent, goes to the
United States. Even the most rabid Freetrader
is bound to admit that there is little profit for Aus-
tralia in trade with the United States, for the
States chiefly send goods and take in return
chiefly gold. If Australia had no petroleum de-
posits of its own this oii business would be bad
enough ; but the bitterest part of the business is
that in N.S.W. are some of the largest and richest
deposits of oil shale in the world. Queensland
has also enormous deposits, though they are deeper,
and Tasmania has similar wealth. At present
this wealth is lying idle, and the people who own
it are spending, in round figures, £2,000,000 witli
people oversea while they have these splendid
stores under their own feet. N. IS. Wales has
already made gallant attempts to create an oil
industry, having started as far back as 1853 ; and
the result has been a long record of failure. Of
late years the industry has steadily declined, and
the recent suicidal policy of placing kerosene on
the free list was the last straw. In 1890 the value
of the N.S.W. oil output was £104,103. In ’92 it
was £136,079. The following year it dropped to
£101,220, and it has been declining ever since.
In 1902 it had got down to £59,717; in ’O3 to
£28,617; and in ’O4, the last year for which the
figures are available, to £26,771.
This record of slump and failure should convince
Australians that some sort of fostering is abso-
lutely essential. Our oil is of a higher grade than
the Yankee article, and is richer in by-products of
value. And yet, owing to the difficulties of start-
ing a new industry and to the Napoleonic (or
Vandal) methods of the Yankee Oil Trust, it is
impossible for Australians to get their industry
going. To preserve that market of nearly
£2,000,000 per annum the Standard Oil Trust
is prepared to flood Australia with low-priced oil
for a number of years. The history of this criminal
combination proves conclusively that it stops at
nothing. It has been charged with forgery,
murder, secret and illegal rebates, piracy, and
almost every crime in the calendar except suicide,
and never once has it gone for the people who
swore the affidavits, and proceeded against them
for libel or perjury. In 1905 the local representa-
tives of Standard Oil attempted to institute
throughout Australia the system by which large re-
tailers who sold only Standard Oil and rigorously
boycotted all others were to receive a rebate of id.
per gallon on oil purchased. To secure the rebate
there had to be signed a declaration worded thus :
I (or we) hereby declare that I (or we) have neither
bought nor sold any other than American SNOWFLAKE
or WHITE ROSE kerosene during the six monthsending
——, my (orour) purchases being —— cases, made on the
following dates : SIGNED ADDRESS
It is understood that in deference to the Com-
merce Act this rebate system was discarded ; but
the rebate is not the only weapon in the hands of
the Standard Oil vultures. The incident is men-
tioned merely to show the Australian people that
the great Yankee octopus is prepared to use the
same methods, as far as it can safely do so, to
crush the Australian industry that it used to
destroy rival refiners in the United States—
methods that were only too successful.
* * * *
The trouble about starting an oil industry is
that the refining of the shale necessitates the
establishment of a huge and costly plant. After
all, we are only a little people, and a plant that
runs to hundreds of thousands of pounds is
beyond the average Australian investor. One big
refinery can keep a hundred crude oil works and
shale mines going, but till the Commonwealth Oil
Corporation finishes the great concern at YVolgan
Vale (N.S.W.) there is no refinery of any capacity
in Australia. Another thing that handicaps the
Australian oil industry is that the shale lies in
the wildest and most rugged portions of the Blue
Mountains, where transport is impossible till roads
are made and railways laid down. The Common-
wealth Oil Corporation has attempted to meet this
difficulty by building a railway which runs
throughrich shalecountry where hundreds of mines
and crude oil works could be established. And so,
for the first time in its history, N.S.W. has a
chance of getting its oil industry established on a
workable basis. And just when this new develop-
ment had opened up a prospect of a great and
thriving industry, the House of Representatives,
in a moment of sheer insanity, and dazed by the
shou ts of Cook and Reid and therestof theallegedly
Freetrade delegation from N.S.W., placed
kerosene on the free list, and gave the stan-
dard Oil Trust a free hand to crush the
struggling industry. Of course, when the fight
commences in real earnest, the Australian con-
sumer will get cheap oil for a while; but when
the local industry has been killed, the price will
go up, and the consumer will not only be made to
make up the loss incurred in the cheap-oil period,
but be compelled to pay compound interest on it.
And in the end he will be much worse off, even as
far as the price paid for oil is concerned, while
the benefit of having several thousand men em-
ployed in a thriving industry will have been lost
for ever. For no matter how the oil industry
may boom at some future time, that present loss
can never be made good. A loss of that kind
bears compound interest for ever.
* * * •*
Public meetings have recently been held in the
affected districts, and addressed by men who under-
stand the situation from A to Z or even more, and
the general idea is that a bounty of 3d. per gallon
on crude oil would set the industry on its feet.
But the great essential is to convince the foreign
dumper and wrecker that Australia is determined
to foster its oil industry, and the only thing that
can produce that effect is the levying of a pro-
hibitive duty on foreign oil. Lord Curzon,
while Viceroy of India, went for the Standard Oil
Trust with an axe in each hand. He not only
fostered the local oil industry with kindly
administration, which enabled it to undersell the
Yankee dumper, but he ukased that no American,
and no American’s agent, could own or hold an
interest in any oil-bearing country within the
Indian Empire. Lord Curzon is a Freetrader in
theory, just as he believes theoretically in Jonah
and the Whale; but he is no Freetrader in
practice, and he saw that the criminal nature of
Yankee opposition could be met only by drastic
measures, so he cut at the root. Now, it stands
to reason that if the Indian oil industry, which
has the advantage of almost the cheapest labor on
earth, and also the benefit of cheap water carriage
and a local market of nearly 300,000,000 people,
could not stand up against the Yankee Trust
without such drastic support as was given by this
theoretically Freetrade Viceroy, an Australian
shale oil industry, which has to pay white men’s
wages, and which has to construct its own rail-
ways and has no cheap water carriage, is in a
hopeless plight. The Bulletin hopes the Aus-
tralian Parliament will go carefully into this mat-
ter and, by imposing a prohibitive duty on Yankee
oil, give this struggling, and otherwise fore-
doomed oil industry a chance to grow great and
to bring much jiopulation and wealth into the
country.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Wanted, a Federal Capital Referendum.
Now that the Deakin part}' is out of office the Defence
policy is left an open question, and inquiry as to what is
to be done about it becomes pertinent. The Conscription
Bill which the Government brought in may evidently be
regarded as done with, owing to the change of Govern-
ment. It is well known that the Labor party is divided
on the principle of compulsory service, especially in the
left-handed, un thought-out, and absurdly discriminating
form in which it has been proposed. Whether the party
will feel any obligation to go on with a re-arrangement on
the conscription basis is, indeed, very questionable, in
spite of the report that one of the new Ministers is to take
the subject up and bring forward a scheme of his own.
THAT THE PUBLIC HAS NEVER BEEN CONSULTED
ON THE MATTER OUGHT TO BE A DETERRING
ARGUMENT TO A PARTY WHICH PROFESSES
NOTHING IF NOT TO BE DEMOCRATIC.— Sydney
Telegraph last Friday.
The above remarks reminded The Bulletin of
something—the people of Australia have not been
consulted about the proposed Yassberra capital.
This is a stupendous oversight, and ought to be
remedied. The case is one in which the need for
a referendum of the people of all Australia, both
as to the location of the capital and the size
of the Federal territory, is wanted so badly
that nothing could be wanted much worse.
About the proposed universal military training
the people were consulted—so far as they can be
consulted about anything without a referendum
and merely by the shiftless methods of a general
election ; the subject was mooted before the pre-
sent Australian Parliament was chosen in 1906,
and as the Deakin Government came back alive
from the political battle its project was to some
extent endorsed. Certainly it wasn’t endorsed as
it would have been at a successful referendum,
but it was as much endorsed as Carruthers or
Wade or Bent or Philp ever were. In like
manner the Federal capital at Dalgety was en-
dorsed ; it was under the Watson Government
that Dalgety was selected, and the people
applauded to the extent of returning the W atson
party (now the Fisher party) in greater
strength than before, and in keeping the
Deakin Government, which was also for Dalgety,
in office. That also was less satisfactory
than a referendum would have been, yet
it was something. But Yass-Canberra hasn’t
been endorsed by the people either at a
referendum, or a general election, or a by-
election, or any other old thing. Yassberra wasn’t
even mentioned in the House until a few weeks
ago, let alone being mentioned to the electors.
The people haven’t been consulted about the pro-
posal to have a sort of Federal port at Jervis Bay,
where, the place being inside the 100-miles radius
of Sydney, the capital may be robbed of its port
any day by a decision of the High Court. The
proposal to put the Federal city on the edge of
Barren Jack reservoir—a place that is liable to be
completely drained for irrigation purposes by the
State authorities in drought seasons, and turned
into the supreme mudhole of Australia—is a
matter that the people have never been consulted
about. There has been no referendum on the
impudent claim of State Premier Wade to dictate
the area of the Federal territory (144 square miles
is talked of at present.) The neglect to consult the
people directly—though they have been consulted
indirectly—about compulsory military trainingmay
be lamentable, as the Sydney Telegraph asserts;
but it isn’t one-tenth so infamous as the failure to
consult the people, either directly or indirectly,
or in any way at all, about the proposed Yass-
berra metropolis. Yassberra wasn’t even men-
tioned at the election of 1906. It was suddenly
nominated and balloted for in October, 1908.
Now the Telegraph and Herald and Evening
News and other papers of their kind are clamoring
to have a Bill passed fixing the capital at Yass-
berra before the session closes in December, 1908.
When Yassberra got a small majority at the
ballot there was immediate talk about having the
Parliament located there in about a couple of
years, which would necessarily involve com-
mitting the country to Yassberra by a
large expenditure of public money before
the people have a chance —the elections being
still more than a year ahead—to express
even an indirect opinion upon the swindle.
Plainly the Federal capital matter is one which
shouts at the top of its voice for a referendum of
the people of all Australia, especially when, in the
Telegraph’s own language, the party in power is
one “ which professes nothing if not to be demo-
cratic.” For such a party to allow a Yassberra
capital to be rushed through without consultation
with the people would be an outrage, and would
justify the community in throwing it out at
the first opportunity.


Wade’s Tactics and a Capital and Certain
Mudholes.
This rather jerky letter comes from a man living
near Cooma
Re the Moonbah River. It is handy to Dalgety, but it
is no more a necessity to'Dalgety than, say, the Cooma
Wade cited it as “the river’’—the sole source of the
Monaro capital’s water supply—letting the lie loose at
the very last moment of time, and putting the Moonbah
alongside the Cotter.
Well, for some facts.
For January the Cotter was a chain of stagnant water-
holes, and the Moonbah was a clear, runningstream. W ade,
when he published the alleged water supplies of the Cotter
and the Moonbah for the year so far as it had gone, stated
that for the period between Sept. 1 and 15, he hadn’t
the returns to hand for Moonbah. He had. The returns
were sent in as usual. Rut at that time the Moonbah
was in flood, carrying an extra 6ft. of water. The full
returns would have shown . that the Moonbah (though
about the smallest of the four rivers on which the Dal-
gety capital would rely) was better than the Cotter, the
sole supply of Canberra. The full returns were not pub-
lished.
The Sydney D.T. some time ago published a beautiful
picture of Lake George with fine mountains in the back-
ground—a vast sheet of water (the lake '27 miles by six)
entitled “ Between Yass-Canberra and Jervis Bay.”
Well, I was at the alleged lake several months ago.
Not a spoonful of water to be seen. Grass growing and
cattle grazing, and actual fencing going on in the lake
bed. Another lying argument 1
The papers represent Dalgety as perched on the tops of
the mountains, and speak of its severe climate, and so on.
Well, what is the height of Dalgety itself ? The pro-
tecting mountain range off at the distance rises 5000 ft.
above the Dalgety site. And what is the height of the
selected Yassberra, and what about its severe climate?
For the past 20 years the temperature of Dalgety was
never lower than 34°. What of the Yassberra site ? I
think 29° was given.
At the recent Cooma show the judge (I believe he was
from Yass) said that the Dalgety vegetable exhibit would
beat anything in the State.
Last week I chanced on a bag of Dalgety-grown pota-
toes, and 401 potatoes weighed 2121 b. Weston’s grapes
last year went on an average nearly 31b. to the bunch.
And in this cold climate too !
Last June was the coldest month of the year for
Sydney. During that month Dalgety held the record
school attendance for the State. Some of the kiddies
have to walk, too, anything from three to six miles. The
schoolmaster told me that there hasn’t been a fall of snow
at Dalgety in the last two years. Can same be said of
Goulburn, Moss Vale, Yass-Canberra, Yass? Canberra
anyhow, gets snow.
All the rivers are beautiful just now and full, even the
Murrumbidgee. I bet had the Yassberra Senators to
drink a glass of Murrumbidgee water before voting they
wouldn’t be so fond of it. It is right enough at present
and we might call it the Murrumbidgee, but several
months of the year the Murrumbidgee might be called
purely and simply the Hydatids River. It is a dirty,
winding, slow, undrinkable stream hereabouts, the color
of gutter water. Put that alongside the pure, swiftly-
flowing Snowy.
Wade certainly made a good move. It was a trump
card that euchred Australia and took in the two fool
Victorian Senators. He would, he said, deal liberally in
the matter of a grant of land at Yassberra and of a sea
access at Jervis Bay. Of course, Jervis Bay is inside the
100-miles limit, and is liable to be ruled out by the High
Court. And Oarruthers says cheerfully that, owing to
the stupendous gorge of the Clyde River, a railway from
Yassberra to Jervis Bay is impossible.
Then Colonel Ryrie said in an interview recently that
the State could be generous in that region,as the country
was so poor that it" didn’t matter how much of that land
the State gives. Ryrie lives there and ought to know.
When talk comes of a railway, then the beggarly poverty
of that country will be used as an argument against going
on with the line. And it will be indefinitely postponed.
Deakin sold his country and his followers shamefully
and disgracefully over this matter. He knew what was
the right thing to do, but he would neither rally up his
party and stake his Ministerial existence on the doing of
it nor even make a serious effort to refute Wade’s misrep-
resentations on the other side. He would only pose in
the limelight as the man with the beautiful conscience.
Let us all hope that this political waster and political she-
man never again attains office in Australia !
♦
Dragging Everything to Sydney—or
Melbourne.
While pushing through the Cooma-Bornbala
Railway Bill, N.S.W. Minister Lee took the
opportunity to work off an old dead stock of noble
sentiments about the necessity for considering the
interests of the State generally, and not those of
Sydney alone. The sentiments were excellent,
and it was doubtless advisable to get off the rem-
nants of last season’s platitudes when there was a
chance, and make room for the new summer
goods that are coming in. Yet the platitudes
were unfortunately quite out of place, and they
were very dusty and frayed goods to boot. The
Bombala railway, as things are apparently going
to be managed, will only be another instance of
the resolve to drag everything to Sydney, regard-
less of the loss to the person at the other end of
the line. The existing Cooma railway brings the
exports of Northern Monaro 266 miles to Sydney,
though in order to do so they pass by the allegedly
splendid harbor of Jervis Bay. The Bombala
extension means that the goods of Southern
Monaro will be dragged 318 miles to Sydney,
though in doing so they are simply being dragged
away from the excellent port of Twofold Bay,
which is right there. When theliue goes on to Dele-
gate and the Victorian border, the goods of ex-
treme Southern Monaro will be dragged 340 miles
to Sydney, passing Twofold Bay on the road.
Somebody has to pay for all this needless draggage
of goods—either the people of Cooma and Bom-
bala and thereabouts, or those of the State at
large. Minister Lee made a great song about the
liberal-minded attitude which made N.S.W. not
care a straw even if the completion of a railway
through Monaro in N.S.W., and East Gippsland
in Victoria, supplied an alternative route to Mel-
bourne, and allowed Monaro to trade with that
port instead of with Sydney if it felt so inclined.
It was the cheapest kind of liberalism that could
well be imagined. In the first place, the Bombala
railway will stop short about 23 miles from the
Victorian border, and even if the Victorian
Government builds the East Gippsland line to the
border, N.S.W., if it keeps on having Govern-
mentslike the onesit has had, will probably refuse
to connect. It has steadily refused to fill in the little
gap between Finley (N.S.W.) and the border at
Tocumwal, and compulsorily drags the traffic of that
part of Riverina 454 miles to Sydney when, with
the building of a few miles of cheap line over a
dead level plain, the people might get a far cheaper
outlet at Melbourne about 200 miles away. It
preserves a gap in its Lismore-Tweed railway to
prevent the North Coast people getting a handy
outlet at Brisbane, which is only one-fifth as far
away from them as Sydney is. It refused Broken
Hill a State railway to the S.A. border, and
forced it to fall back on Private Enterprise ;
rather than be associated with any scheme that
would carry N.S.W. trade to Adelaide it threw
away the profits of the most lucrative little line
in all Australasia. While the Sydney Govern-
ment pursues this short-sighted, grudging policy
of sacrificing the interests of all the outlying
parts of N.S.W. to Sydney, it is a mere joke for
]y£ij}i§ter Lee to babble about liberalism and
such-like frills. But even if the Cooma-Bornbala
line is completed to the Victorian border, and
joined to an East Gippsland line connecting with
Melbourne, Monaro will be no better off. Vic-
toria has the narrow, mean, grudging craze to drag
everything to Melbourne just as badly as Is.S.W .
has the Sydney-dragging craze. That completed
railway would give the people of the richest part
of Southern Monaro the alternative of sending
their goods about 320 miles to Sydney via Goul-
burn, which is bad, or about 330 miles to Mel-
bourne via Bairnsdale, with a break of gauge at
the border, which is worse. Meanwhile the fine
N.S.W. port of Twofold Bay will be lying empty
at the Monaro people’s very doors, and not only
they but the Victorian people of East Gippsland
will be denied the use of it because everything
must be dragged to Sydney—if it isn’t dragged to
Melbourne. A railway down to sea-level at
Twofold Bay is no more difficult an
undertaking than a railway, starting from the
same elevation, down to sea-level at Bairnsdale or
Sydney. N.S.W. finds no serious trouble about a
railway that drops 3600 ft. in 52 miles between
Clarence and Emu Plains, and the talk of insuper-
able difficulties in a drop of 2750 ft. from Dalgety
to the coast is sheer absurdity. Yet the proposal
of the Australian Government to build a railway
(three-fifths of the money being put up by Queens-
land, Victoria, Tasmania, S.A. and Westralia),
and so open up a port which would save the
people of southern N.S.W. an immensity of use-
less and costly railway haulage, has been treated
with curses for four years past as a shameful insult
toN.S.W. The present N.S.W. Government is as
bad as the worst of its predecessors in its craving
to drag everything to Sydney, even if the people
of the outlying parts of N.S.W. are beggared in
the process—just as mean and as sordid and as
unpatriotic. And the drivel of Solemn Lee about
the large-minded readiness of his Government to
see Monaro connected with Melbourne, and to
give the bulk of its population the alternative of
trading with the bloated city over 300 miles away,
or the more bloated city also over 300 miles away,
is insult added to hypocrisy while Solemn Lee
belongs to a Government which deliberately
keeps Monaro’s own port cut off from all com-
munication.
The Friendship of Neild and Gray.
At the re-union of N.S.W. manufacturers held in
Sydney Exhibition Building last week, Senator
Neild, Freetrader, had the gall to turn up and
say how deeply interested he was and always had
been in the development of N.S.W. manufactures,
and to congratulate the State on “the great
strides that are being made ” in its industries
under the tariff which Neild fought to the bitter
end, and which he still denounces with all the fury
that is in him. And Senator “Soapy” Gray,
also a Freetrader, had the front to lift up his
presence and explain how pleased he was at “the
development that had taken place in the manu-
factures of N.S.W. since Federation” —and also
under the tariff which Soapy Gray fought all he
knew, and which he denounces to this day, and
which the fool people of N.S.W. elect him to
oppose and, if possible, to get repealed. Both
these awful persons spread themselves on the
assurance that Freetraders were most anxious
to see the expansion of local manufactures,
and that any idea of hostility on the part of that
political faction was quite a delusion.
To these remarks the only possible
reply is that they are flatly, glar-
ingly, obviously untrue. In N.S. W.
the Freetrade party has, in a. multi-
tude of cases, deliberately laid itself
out to destroy Australian manufac-
tures, and to destroy the Australian
capital invested in them, and to beg-
gar the men who invested that capi-
tal, and to starve the workmen en-
gaged in the industry and their
wives and their children. They have
done it coldly and brutally and cal-
lously. The N.S.W. Freetrade party
was always dominated by that rich,
useless, arrogant middleman, the
Sydney importer, and his hatred of
Australian manufactures was, and
is, based on the fact that it only
requires a sufficient extension of the
manufacturing business, and his lazy,
useless middleman’s job will be
gone. The importer is a man
who makes a living—and a very
good one, too—by interposing be-
tween the foreign manufacturer and the local
retailer, because the latter isn t rich enough to
send a traveller all the way to England or Ger-
many or America to overhaul the foreign manu-
facturer’s stock and select the goods he wants.
But when the manufacturer is right here he has a
beastly habit of dealing direct with the retailer
and ignoring the importer altogether. If Smith,
the retailer of Waverley, wants £lOO worth of the
goods that are manufactured at Jones’s factory at
Paddington, he and Jones have a lamentable
habit of dealing direct, instead of Jones
selling the £lOO worth of goods to Bloggs,
the middleman in York-street, and deliver-
ing them at his warehouse, and letting him
cart them back to Smith at Waverley and
charge him £125 for them. Therefore the im-
porter loathes all local manufactures that inter-
fere with his business; and both he and the
Freetrade party which does his dirty work
have always fought against them by every dis-
reputable method they could devise. Now, how-
ever, they begin to find the battle going
against them, and, thanks to Federation
and the Federal tariff, the patriotic cause shows
signs of winning. Therefore it is up to those
Freetrade and anti-Australian Senators, whom
N.S. W. is so foolish as to send to Parliament that
they may try to bring about its ruin, to crawl
soft-footedly round to manufacturers’ exhibitions
and such-like, and try to make friends with the
men whom their party has labored to rum and
destroy. It may be good business policy, but it
would be much more decent and in much better
taste if such men as Neild and Gray cultivated a
judicious absence on such occasions.

Borrowing, and Two Sacred Compacts.
The side of the House of Heps, which George
Reid and Joe Cook decorate has been the
Foreign-trade party and then the Anti-Socialist
party, and now it appears that it is going to be
the Borrowing party. The two Sydney papers
which represent the Foreign-trade interest have
become, within the last few weeks, perfect whales
for Federal borrowing. Said the S. M. Herald
last Friday in a leader on “ Federal Finance :
It is necessary to keep this side of the question upper-
most because the logical development of the Labor policy
is to appropriate in 1911 the moneys which are essential
to the solvency of the various States. The adjustment of
Commonwealth and State finance must come before the
Braddox clause expires, or there will be a very serious posi-
tion to face. The Labor ideal is unification, and it is pro-
posed to force something- of the sort by refusing- to help
the States with an agreement which will give them a
measure of freedom by a fair apportionment of the
revenue from Customs and Excise. Let the prin-
ciple be enforced that all public works must
be constructed out of revenue, and one of two
things will happen. Either every department connected
with" the Commonwealth will become a byword and a
reproach, since it will not have funds to meet urgent
needs, or the States will be driven into insolvency. If
the Commonwealth in two or three years’ time is to have
millions of money to play with, it can only be at the ex-
pense of the States ; and that way lies risk for union
itself. It will be temptation without any restraint from
responsibility. Millions will be required, no doubt, but
no Government and no party will live in Australia that
sacrifices principle and fair dealing—and the States into
the bargain—to serve a stupid prejudice against borrow-
ng-
This weepful allusion to the fact that in 1911 and
afterwards the Commonwealth can retain all the
Customs and Excise revenue, recalls once more the
memory of the Herald’s tin-god Reid and his
doings. The original Constitution left the loca-
tion of the Federal capital an open question, and
it provided that for all time, or until the Consti-
tution was altered by the consent of a majority of
the voters, three fourths of the Customs and
Excise revenue should belong to the State
Governments. Reid, in his insane craving to
show his importance by altering the Constitution
off his qwn silly and ignorant bat, fought against
that agreement in wild-cat fashion, and, though
the people of N.S.W. accepted it, the treachery
of Reid’s Parliament annulled their acceptance.
Then Reid went proudly forth and got the Con-
stitution altered to fix the capital in N.S.W. and
to provide that, after 1910, the Commonwealth
need not return the State Governments one solitary
copper. If that financial arrangement is so awful as
the Herald alleges, then the Herald should long
ago have given up supporting George Reid, the
man who turned Australia upside down to bring
it about, and should denounce him as the poison-
ous ass that, on the Herald’s own showing, he
must be. Federation was nearly lost, just that
Reid, with his loony craving to be top-dog, might
get things so fixed that after 1910 the Common-
wealth may keep all the money. And
Herald holds forth, as it has done fully 17,529
times, about the sacred compact which fixed the
capital in N.S.W., it might remember in common
fairness that there were two equally sacred com-
pacts, and the two went together ; and the second
one was that the Commonwealth can stop paying
money to the States after 1910. If the Australian
Parliament two years hence cuts off every penny
of subsidy to the States, and also establishes a
Federal capital on Monaro and takes 5000 square
miles of N.S.W. for a Federal territory, it
will be living up to the exact letter of the
arrangements which the meddlesome Reid got in-
serted in the Constitution. Seeing that tlie money
which was forced on the Australian Parliament
by the meddlesomeness of Reid will become avail-
able in 1911, why should the Commonwealth
borrow —especially at the bidding of papers which
hold up Reid to admiration as a statesman of the
highest order-—instead of taking advantage of
Reid’s wonderful arrangement? The Tory and
REiD-ite papers have impressed so strongly on the
Federal members the “sacred nature of the
compact ’’which fixes the capital in N.S.W. that
it is impossible for these same members to avoid
noticing the equally sacred nature of the other
compact, made at the same time, at the instance
of the same man, and accepted by the people on
the same day —tlie other compact which authorises
the Commonwealth, after another couple of years,
to hang on to all the money, and use it for build-

Wanted—A Mine of Revelations.
A letter from Melbourne :
The re-election of Premier Bent’s three new Ministers,
Hunt Bowser and Downward —all of whom ought
to bear the third name—may be regarded as the last nail
in the coffin of what was once a living form of newspaper
•mvernment in Victoria. The Age had done its best, to
bring Bent personally into public contempt, and to oust
his deplorable Government from office. Weakened by a
series of reconstructions, effected under circumstances
either discreditable to the Premier or scandalous to the
retiring member, Bent’s Cabinetw f as a ridiculous work of
jobbery when its three latest pieces— Hunt, Bowser and
Downward— asked their constituents for re-election.
The Age exhorted those constituents to “ rise to a sense
of national duty,” etc., and practically destroy Bent’s
shameful Cabinet by throwing its last three pieces out of
Parliament., Time was when the Age’s addresses to the
iury would have sealed the doom of those three unworthy
parliamentarians, but the result of its speeches in this
case amounted to a triumph for the accused. They
were re-elected with substantial majorities. The Cabinet
of Bent, wherein a mass of disreputableness lies con-
cealed (save for as much as can be seen through the
cracks)—the ugly, fractured, mis-shapen, worm-eaten
Cabinet of Bent— has received another lick of varnish and
a promise of further respite from destruction. The spec-
tacle of Thomas Adolphus Bent knocking his Cabinet to-
gether with the same hammer that drove a final
nail into the coffin of the dead-and-gone Age Government
is a somewhat saddening sight. The newspaper which
David and Ebenezer Syme created was not always an
honestly directed power for good, but it was never a per-
sistent, unprincipled force for political evil, like the
graceless, disreputable political jobber who now exults
over it Victoria owes to the politics of the Age most of
the advanced fiscal and social legislation which Bent and
his Parliamentary kind opposed in days of yore.
And though the Age to-day is but a half-hearted
advocate of a thorough policy of land settlement, its
influence in the country should be a wholesome corrective
of BENT-ism. Moreover, it has deserved well of Victoria
for speaking ill of Bi nt himself as a Premier and a person.
Which remark bring'S one to the fact that the Age has
really worked its own humiliation by 7 not speaking all the
ill it knew of. Circumstances required a full exposure of
Bent’s awfulness, a searching and costly inquiry into his
manifold sins and trickinesses—a revelation, in short,
that would have made the continuance of his wretched,
unwholesome Government absolutely 7 impossible. The
Age has concealed its actual knowledge under a thick
veil of insinuation, whilst refraining from explorations in
the Darkest Africa of Bent’s wide political sphere.
What it said was of no avail, because it
didn’t say more. Victoria in general is still
profoundly ignorant of Bent’s true character, ine
things actually known against him are a disgrace to
the House that accepts his leadership in consideration of
the favors he distributes. The things that could be proved
against his Government are the outcome of tus l° n g
immunity from exposure. Where Bent has been king for
years political jobbery naturally reigns. If the Govern-
ment offices could be suddenly seized by a respecteble
committee of inquiry, and the secret history of the Bent
Period were written up by an eloquent accountant, even
the untaxed landowners would sicken of the old man and
veteran schemer who has converted the Government of
Victoria into a personal enterprise, and taken a majority
of the House into partnership. The scandal of Govern-
ment by Bent is now so involved that the best
informed critics —of which the Age is the 5 10S ’'
powerful—are loth to make the worst of it-
in the prime of its political strength, the Age could
not have knocked Bent from his present position
with a few body blows. Only by the explosion of a mine
of revelations under his feet can the attacking newspaper
shift Thomas Adolphus. He stands now like a dummy
figure, with a stronsr wire framework deep rooted in de-
ception. Or—to vary the simile without changing its
sense—he hangs on to office like a punching-ball so®'
pended from a beam. When tlie Age struck at him, the
other day, he rebounded and gave it a most humiliating
facer. More’s the pity !
The Demoralisation of the I 0 U.
G. T. Allen, Secretary to the Australjan
Treasury, was up before the Postal Commission
a few days ago, giving it some good ad vice. Put
to it by some of the members who too clearly
want to introduce a borrow-anej-bporn policy,
Allen admitted that the principal difficulty ex-
perienced in financing the Postal Department
arose in consequence of the decision of Parliament
to pay out of revenue for works which the States
used to pay for out of loans. Even George
Turner saw that so many things wanted doing
that he proposed to borrow about £700,000 for
Postal works ; but the House wouldn’t stand the
borrowing, so i< the only course left to the Postal
Department was to proceed with new works
and buildings as fast as the money granted
by the Treasurer would allow.” Unfortunately
the Treasurer didn’t allow enough, being
too anxious to return unnecessarily large
balances to the States; and, instead of thanking
him, they mostly snarled and cursed, and said it
ought to be more. Consequently, things which
the Postal Department ought to have done it
hasn’t been able to do, and the public has suffered.
This ought to be enough to suggest to the public
that there are not tw 7 o publics in Australia, but
only one; consequently, when the Common-
wealth is starved to feed the States, it is the
people who suffer—they and nobody else. N. S.
Wales, in particular, has got into the habit of
regarding the Commonwealth as something which
represents somebody in 1’ iji, or lvamschatka, or
some other remote places; here, however, is
proof that it is they—the people of N. S. Wales—
who, in common with the rest of Australia, have
had to suffer through the starvation of the Commo-
nwealth Treasury; and it must be j ust the same in the
future—the State Treasuries can’t be glorified at
rhe expense of the Commonwealth without the
people of N. S. Wales and other parts of Australia
having to pay the bill in the shape of discomforts
and annoyances and lack of services. Meantime,
however, the question is whether the best use is
being made of the Department, or whether the
Department is what it ought to be. In the old
State days of borrowing nothing mattered very
much at the Post Office. If revenue didn’t equal
expenditure, then it simply meant a bit of
borrowing. The policy was absolutely demoralis-
ing ; it was the old business of the boss being able
to drop an I O U into the till at any time, and
subsequently treat it with blank indifference. A
profit and loss account under such circumstances
would have been a farce, as it always is a farce when
money is borrowed to pay for things that ought
to be paid for out of revenue. Apparently the
Post Office therefore got out of the habit of mak-
ing up a profit and loss account and a balance-sheet;
anyway, what figures have been published have
always been put forward doubtfully. Also the
Secretary to the Treasury says that he thinks
“ there ought to be annual statements of accounts
and a balance-sheet of the Postal Department,”
from which it is a fair thing to assume that those
things haven’t existed so far. And it is doubtful
whether they can be made to exist under present
conditions. In the Sydney office alone, according
to a reply made by the Postmaster-General the
other day, nearly 19,000 hours of overtime have
been worked, apparently during this financial
The Deluge.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This is a Bible story for pious folks to read,
A parable of warning that whiskered saints should
heed —
An awful old example for men of Austral blood,
How ancient Noah bleated about a coming flood.
He bleated in the city, he bleated in the wild ;
The fat importers mocked him, the thin church-
wardens smiled ;
Lads of two hundred summers at primal cricket
played,
Or wooed Cain’s blushful daughters and heard
him undismayed.
A century of talking made Noah lean and hoarse,
The patriarchal bookies roared loud on every
course,
To back the racing mammoth the whiskered thou-
sands flew,
And jests of coming liquid more stale and fiequent
grew.
Then, as you know, a deluge, remarkable and
large ’ x, TVT
Drowned everyone who wasn’t afloat on Noah S
barge;
It happened rather quickly, if old accounts are
right,
And all the world’s engagements were cancelled
in a night.
Now, please observe, this legend is written for
your good—
To read, and mark, and study when in a pious
mood;
Because Australian Noahs are shouting all they
can :
Build arks of steel, ye dreamers ! Arise and play
the man ! ”
Not water, clean and wholesome, shall drown you
if you fail,
But through some night of horror shall spread the
stricken wail,
When the brown human deluge breaks on your
fenceless shore,
And Noah’s voice of warning is still for evermore.
MAORILAND.

Before succumbing to the wiles of the

should remember that D.C.L. is known as the

year, by the clerical staff; and the business
of the Department has obviously outgrown
its methods of accountancy. Those methods,
as said just now, grew up under the old State bor-
rowing regime, and they are not suitable to the
new conditions. The whole thing wants modern-
ising : the Post Office is a vast business concern,
run now for the first time as a business must be
(for the ordinary business hasn’t got an uncle to
fall back on all the time), and it is highly probable
that conditions will not be satisfactory until the
financial end of the Department has been over-
hauled by men who have had some experience of
business organisation and methods. If that is not
done, and if things are allowed to drift and the
consequent waste continues, it will be harder work
for the Government to resist the invitation to
drop into the easy but suicidal bog of borrowing ;
and that is a bog that must be fenced off at
almost any cost.
Thus N.S.W. Works Minister Dee, arguing for
the Cooma-Bombala Railway Bill in the As-
sembly :
One powerful motive which led to the rejection of the
Bill in the Legislative Council last year was the fear that
if the line were sanctioned it would mean the locating of
the Federal capital at Dalgety. The capital question,
however, was now practically settled, and he believed
that the present Government would go ahead in bringing
it to a final issue at a much faster rate than any of its
predecessors.
Of course, it’s no news that the N.S.W. Legisla-
tive Council butchered last year’s Bill because if
the line to Bombala were constructed it would be
useful to the Federal capital at Dalgety. It
can’t be repeated too often that the in-
terests of the splendidly fertile Monaro district
were sacrificed to assist the scheme of the Sydney
capitalists to make the Australian capital a mere
Sydney suburb. The fact that the fossil Chamber
could use its power as a branch of the Legislature
in the furtherance of such a scheme is another-
good reason why the Fossil Chamber should be
deemed unfit to exist, and why it should be
obliterated from the earth. Lee did this country
a real service in recalling the infamy. But Lee
got off the track in the next stride—the capital
question isn't practically settled, not by a long
way. By law the capital is still at Dalgety, and
many things may happen before the law is altered.

The somewhat condensed remarks of architect
Cyril Blacket, who has been studying the Aus-
tralian timber business, back and front, these
many years past:
After many months of inquiry, the report of the
N.S.W. Forestry Commission is to hand. Probably no
one will be satisfied with it, and it is doubtful whether
any result of practical effect will be the outcome of the
many miles of travel or the volumes of evidence which
the report signifies.
The report states that only about 23,000 million feet of
hardwood, equal to 36 years’ supply at current rates of
usage, is now available, of which about half is on the
North Coast, and the balance spread over the rest of the
State.
To improve the position, it is proposed, among other
things, to increase the royalty on hardwoods other than
ironbark, tallow-wood and red gum, from sd. to 6d. per
100 ft. super.
What good can the penny increase do? The price in
Sydney in the log is 6s. 6d. per 100, and the selling price
from 16s. to 205., undressed. What does a penny extra
mean, then ?
This increase to 6d. royalty means ss. for a tree of
average size containing 1000 ft. in the trunk, against
which must be set the cost of burning off the head and
debris and ringing the stump. This will cost more than
55.; so it pays better to kill the tree and let it stand, thus
wasting all the timber.
If, however, the royalty is raised to a substantial
amount the following results come about: —
(1) The settler obtains a price which makes it worth
while to sell instead of wasting the timber.
(2) The settler is so much better off.
(3) As the tree thus acquires a value, other parts
besides the trunk will be used, for ships’ timbers, felloes,
spokes, boats’ knees, etc. These things may be obtained
from the branches.
(4) The State will obtain a revenue by which an
effective Forestry Act may be administered.
If there is only half-a-grain of truth in the sub-
stance of a recent question in N.S.W. Assembly,
then Wade’s “Liberal” Government has about
struck the bedrock of meanness. Holman asked
if it were true that certain old-age pensioners,
who, 19 years ago, got advances of State seed-
wheat, and had been unable to pay up, were
having part of their pensions stopped to make
good the deficiency ? The Minister for Agri-
culture’s reply was beautifully ingenuous -
The Department had been shaken up by the Auditor-
General, with the result that an effort was being made to
get in arrears of seed- wheat advances. Possibly there
were two or three cases of old-age pensioners being called
upon to pay.
How nice!—“ Possibly there were two or three
cases of old-age pensioners being called upon
to pay.” Wade’s Cow Minister wasn’t a bit
shocked to hear that his Department was trying to
gather in some 19-year-old debts by snavelling
part of the paltry few shillings the famished old-
age pensioner depends upon to keep the ancient
ghost and the meat together. He wasn’t even
surprised. He thought it just the sort of mean
thing one of Wade’s Departments would do. And
the thing—assuming it to be true —may be even
meaner than it looks. It may be that the De-
partment is misusing its power to collect debts
which it couldn’t collect in a law court. The
Statute of Limitations gets to work in a much
shorter .period than 19 years, but perhaps the
luckless old-age pensioner does not know that;
and, anyhow, the capitalist of 10s. a week isn’t
likely to bother fighting a Government which, on
its record, would gleefully spend its last deener in
the noble combat.
Sydney Daily Telegraph had an unusual
burst of frankness the other day. Its South
Australian correspondent was reporting the pro-
gress made by Labor Premier Price’s Bill author-
ising the purchase of a State coal mine at Cess-
nock (N.S.W.). Then, having remarked that the
debate was adjourned, the D.T. added :
It is very likely that the Coal Bill will pass in the
Assembly, but may not get through the Council, as
several members there are interested in coal companies.
Still, without a doubt, the Telegraph will con-
tinue to barrack for the maintenance of a House
of Fat as “the guardian of the sacred Consti-
tution.”

One of the conventional lies of our civilisa-
tion is that every citizen in these educated
days knows all about his Shakspeare. There were
few, doubtless, at Sydney Royal last Monday
night, when the writer attended there, that would
have owned to scant previous acquaintance with
“ The Taming of the Shrew.” Withal 90 per cent,
of them would herein have been suppressers of
the truth. And for obvious reasons. This play
possesses neither the charming fantasy of “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream,” nor the divine
poetry of “Romeo and Juliet,” nor the incident
of “ The Tempest,” and so it does not
read well. It goes with much snap when
interpreted by intelligent actors. But that
happens so rarely as to be hardly worth
discussing. It takes considerable hardihood to
offer the general public a r6sum,6 of a Shakspeare
play. Yet is the writer convinced that something
of the sort is needed. He does the deed furtively,
as it were, by means of a parable.

There was a State in a family of States
that was chronically disgruntled. Nothing satis-
fied it. On the least provocation it burst into
tears and raged and carried on like a perfect little
demon. It suffered from a permanent hump. It
felt that its sister States were conspiring behind
its back to “put upon” it ; and that the head of
the family was a malignant, unnatural being
who loathed it, and hankered to destroy
its liberty and prosperity and every other thing
it held dear. So if the head of the family spoke
it kindly it turned on the unhappy creature like a
spitfire, and if its sisters tried to be civil, it railed
at them so that they went away and hid their
heads and murmured the feminine equivalent of
“ D n.” Things were fast reaching a hopeless
pass, and the family had already begun to brood
miserably on asylums and the intricacies of the
“signing up” process, when there happened
along a Man, alike strong and knowledgable. He
took the Aggrieved State in hand. He showed it
what it was to have a genuine grievance. For a
term the State was stunned and incapable of
believing its own senses. But the Man per-
severed most callously. Gradually the in-
furiated State began to see things in their
proper light. The futility and injustice of
the unceasing complaints by which it had
rendered the lives of those around it miser-
able in the past were brought home to it. It
grew more and more amenable. The glad day.
dawned at length, when it stepped forward of its
own accord and voiced an eloquent appeal on be-
half of reasonableness and a total stoppage of un-
necessary nagging. And thereafter it set up the
Man as its idol, and cleaved to him till death or a
general election or something did them part.
There is the plot of the play now running at
Sydney Royal, so adumbrated as not to injure
the feelings of the touchiest.
* * ■* *
The writer went prepared to rave about
the acting in “ The Taming of the Shrew.” He
knew Henry Kolker as a fine artist and Margaret’
Anglin as a comedy actress with more than a
touch of genius. It is a wrench, then, to own
that the performance of the principals in the new
production left him cold. The work of a player,
even as the construction of a play, calls for
criticism in its relation to life. There never was
a Petruehio, outside the Stone Age, with quite
the “manner” of Kolker. Moreover, the actor’s
temperament militates against him in this role.
The strength of Petruehio underlay a whimsical,
fantastic soul, and these qualities seem alien to
the Kolker personality. Assuredly, the real
Petruehio killed the shrewishness of the
thing he loved rather with the “ word,” so
to speak, than with the “sword.” This Gentle-
man of Verona was, for all his quaint ways,
a dignified Italian of rank, living in a period
when deportment was highly esteemed. Kolker
introduces to the part a “ loudness ” and modern
dash that trench betimes on blatancy and appear
curiously out of place in that courteous, mediaeval
atmosphere. Miss Anglin’s beautiful voice, finished
method and sense of rhythm stand to her in
Katharine’s softer moods. For those moments
alone the show is worth a score of visits. But as
a, virago of rank she fails to convince. A civi-
lised gentlewoman is the same in the essentials
in every epoch the civilised world over. One
of the things she imbibes at her mother’s knee is
the art of being objectionable restraiuedly when
in public. Margaret Anglin’s Katharine screams,
chokes, gurgles in her frenzy. She commits all
the social laches that the real Katharine’s un-
tutored tiring-woman would in like circumstances.
Cyril Mackay makes a gallant Lucentio, and
Myles Clifton is a diverting Grumio. The mount-
ing and staging of the play are exquisite.

“ The Merry Widow ” and its ditto dit-
To songs and ditto ditto ditto wit,
Its ditto chorus and its ditto girls,
Its ditto music and its ditto whirls,
Still in the ninth week all the ditto fill,
And ditto ditto yet no change of bill.
Though Carrie Moore is ditto shooting game,
The ditto rage continues ditto same ;
Miss Bertha Ohls will see the season through,
And ditto ditto ditto ditto do.
“ The Prince Chap ” will reside at Sydney
Palace up to and including Friday night (27th).
On that evening Claudia will grow up in three
acts for the last time, and Phoebe Puckers will
fall down stairs with a final thud and a loud con-
cluding shriek. On Saturday (28th) “ A Message
from Mars ” is to be staged, with H. R. Roberts
as Horace Parker, the young man who is so un-
mercifully bullied by the brown messenger.

The National Opera Company was ’way
below previous form in “ The Lily of Killarney,”
which replaced “Les Cloches de Corneville ” at
Sydney Criterion on Saturday night. At that
date (however things may be now) the principals
were uncertain in spots, and the performance of
the chorus—usually beyond cavil—suggested the
urgent need of a day-break “call” on Monday
morning. Miss Aileen Hodgson plays Eily
O’Connor. She has a fine voice and an attractive
stage manner. Also, she is a winsome little lady
otherwise. But nervousness, and, possibly, lack
, of that constant rehearsal which Benedict’s music
demands, handicap her in her more complicated
numbers. Rosina Buckmann (Anne Chute) and
Wilson Pembroke (a stiff and plethoric Hardress
Cregan) have all too little opportunity to display
their fine voices. Edward Wynn is a sufficiently
dashing Myles na Coppaleen. His falsetto note
at the end of the “Sleep Gently ” song wins him
rapturous applause from a section of the audience.
Jay Ryan, a baritone with an upper register of
considerable beauty and power, makes his first
appearance in Sydney as Danny Mann. He is an
actor of merit, and proves one of the redeeming
features of a rather dull and inartistic show.

When The Bulletin sees the Town Hall
only three parts full for an amateur orchestral
concert it will conclude, as the miner does
in “ The Girl of the Golden West,” that
“culture is a dead dog” in Sydney. (The
miner said “California,” and he wasn’t think-
ing of Mozart’s Symphony in G Minor,
but of ability to read simple prose and to recite
“The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck.”) The
Mozartian Symphony, in spite of sparkling pas-
sages and shafts of lightning melody, weighed like
a cargo of marble tombstones on all but the ex-
tremely music-mad. But the feature of the
programme—a feature marked as a cliff at South
Head was the playing of Miss Katharine
Goodson. Her ability to interpret a Slav com-
poser’s joy and sorrow, the landscape coloring, and
the sound of the wind rushing over trees and seas
is so magical as to appeal even to those terrible
persons who can listen to cakewalk music without
experiencing homicidal mania.

Mr. Clarence Lee put a modest estimate
on his four-act play, “ Wrexham’s Duty,” when he
labelled it a melodrama. It is something better,
and if the playwright would go over his work
again and throw half the 30-odd characters into
the dust-box, and lop some of the dialogue, and
put a little more dynamite into the dialogue that
isn’t lopped, he would stand a good chance of
getting an Australian impresario to stage the
experiment. With good professional acting it
ought to be a success. Miss Ida Nicholson as
Millie Vandeleur, and Miss L. Broad as Beatrice
the Frisker, quite won the leathern heart of this
witness. “ Wrexham’s Duty ” was played by the
Playgoers’ Club, in aid of the Veterans’ Fund, for
three nights last week, at the Standard (Sydney),
and it drew good audiences.

The sporty flavor that pervades the atmo-
sphere was noticeable in the pictures which J. T.
West unrolled at Sydney Glaciarium on Saturday
night. They will hold the fitful screen for another
week. The wild and woolly doings of the
Red Girl in western U.S.A. seem to indi-
cate that most of the troubles that afflicted
that lawless land were due to the sport-
ing instinct having gone quite mad. Another
neat gamble was the struggle between an all-fired
cute gang of Yankee coiners and the invincible
Yankee detective. Greek meeting Greek isn’t a
circumstance beside Yank coiner meeting Yank
detective. The culmination of the show was a
phantasmagoria of vast, sweeping things de-
scribed as the Gordon Bennett Balloon Race. A
balloon race is a fearful proceeding.

At Sydney Lyceum, Spencer serves up a
mixture of picture sensations that is more varied
than ever. The people who hanker for the
dramatic have their cravings supplied by the story
of Ingomar making an old fool of himself for the
sake of the Greek Parthenia. The sports are
roused to enthusiasm by the sight of Barry and
Towns training for the Sportsman Cup race, and
later on by Barry walking away from Towns in
the final struggle with the world’s. broken
record trailing behind him. And for the
rest, the children who love the colored
fairy story, the people who like the weep-
ful tragedy and groan delightedly as “ the Shriek
in the Wash Basin ” pervades the palace halls ;
and the others who gloat in ecstasy over the spec-
tacle of Jones coming home drunk and falling
down street precipices, and tumbling into bed
with the horse in the stable, and drinking from
the bucket instead of the seltzogene—they all
have their particular turns, and are sent home
satisfied.

Sydney Tivoli these times is never without
its comedy team. Hodgson and Lowther are
about the fourth successive firm of entertainers
whose business is the farce that knows not Rhyme
and hasn’t even a nodding acquaintance with
Reason. Their turn is sufficiently funny, and
“Barmaids” —the hilarious title the programme
attaches to their impossibility—threatens to be-
come popular. Guest and Newlyn, the other
newcomers, indulge in patter, but their dancing is
their strongest claim to immortal fame. Tom
Dawson, the weird, has come back ; Burt Shepard
is on the point of departure ; and the musical
Latonas, comedian J. W. Rickaby, and the Three
McGregors remain as they were. Duncan’s
collies are doing a fire rescue act instead of their
former motor tragedy, and the Palace of Cards
is still intact.

“Miss Hook of Holland,” at Adelaide
Royal, is tuneful and danceful, but the humor of
it is thin. The character of Hook senior shows
clear evidence of “working up” by G. P. Huntley
in London. It is not a “Johnny” part such as
he generally takes ; still, when a man picks up a
vegetable-marrow —apropos of nothing whatever
—and remarks, “ Oh, look at that one ! Doesn’t
it look a treacherous little thing ? ” then it is clear,
dear brethren, that the spirit of the departed
Huntley is present with us this evening. Miss
Essie Perrin is a pleasing exception to the modern
rule that a leading dancer must not be handsome
of feature. The piece has entered on the second
week, which in Adelaide spells Success.

One of the most interesting of Adelaide’s
recent concerts has been that devoted entirely to
local composers. They made an unexpectedly good
showing. Ada Crossley has moved out of the
Town Hall, and Mark Hambourg has moved in.
And the Boxing Kangaroo has faded off the
Tivoli horizon, much regretted. He put up a
willing go when in good health, but that was all
too seldom. It is not in the least likely that St.
Paul had any marsupial in view when he wrote of
the spirit being willing and the flesh weak ; but
that expresses to a nicety the position of this par-
ticular “ amoosin’ little cuss.”

In the sacred cause of charity (i.e., the
Isolation Ward of the Foundling Hospital) a
number of Melbourne amateur actors strutted
their little 2£ hours on the stage at Melbourne
Princess’s last Saturday afternoon. They played
“The Liars,” and as members of the ppliter
social circles they were at least in sympathy with
the sentiment of H. A. Jones’s comedy of fibs.
The same thing has been better done by other
local amateurs, as regards the leading lady charac-
ter, her male partner in indiscretion, and her angry
husband and his gloomy brother. But taken
altogether the performance was an interesting
display both of amateur mumming and its limita-
tions, and of physical inability to present even a
semblance of the author’s ideal. For instance, the
intensely romantic hero and fervid lovemaker of
the story had a suitably impressive voice and a pair
of stout low-comedy legs. He straddled the part.
He simply couldn’t walk through it effectively ; he
might almost as well have been pulled through it
in an invalid’s chair. On the other hand, the
worldly-wise bachelor and principal speechmaker
of the piece (0. Vallange) was equipped with all
the essentials save a reasonable amount of flesh.
The character, as he portrayed it, was slim and
gentlemanly to a fault. It was cut down to the
bone. It lacked the meat of human kindness,
but was anatomically pleasing. Another success
among the men was the harmless, incidental
“cipher” husband (Tom H. Cochran), who hap-
pened, however, to be rather tall and thin instead
of puny. The dialogue libelled him. The angry
husband amounted to a moderate failure, and his
gloomy brother, a young man with obtrusively
red and cuffless hands, made one wish he were a
foundling who had died in infancy. Not that he
acted unintelligently, but because his amateurish-
ness was so ill-dressed.

The six ladies of the company had good
looks, good clothes, and, in some cases, a graceful
deportment to recommend them. Leaving the
demure menial maid-in-blaclc out of consideration,
there are three women conspirators who revel in
untruthfulness, one soft-spoken human cat, and
one gentle widow with “a beautiful nature,” which
appears to have been amply provided for by her
late husband. Mrs. Alfred Cornish as the well-
bred feline was a more competent actress than
Miss Nan O’Hara as the widow, but the latter
looked as naturally beautiful and sweet as a
widow in easy circumstances ought to be.
Miss Athol Levey was a bright, chirpy Dolly
Coke, the liar ever ready to swear anything to
serve a female relative in distress. Miss Marjorie
Levey trifled flippantly and unfeelingly with the
problematical giddiness of the heroine, and Mrs.
Vallange gave full expression, here and there, to
the character of the other assistant schemer, who
is naturally plump and amiable because she has
everything her own way in her frivolous world.
Bits of her performance were charmingly un-
affected. Next to the vegetable tributes that
concluded the entertainment, Mrs. Vallange was
its brightest feature.

That old and powerful attraction, “The
Private Secretary,” accomplished another remark-
able feat of strength last Saturday in drawing a
vast audience up the steep steps which lead to
Melbourne Bijou. If a farcical comedy can live
a quarter-of-a-century—and “The Secretary”
is nearly 25 years ancient in Melbourne—it
arrives, seemingly, at a renewal of its youth. The
roar of the multitude on Saturday night was punc-
tuated with screams of surprise at the novel
absurdity of Rev. Robert Spalding. He was a com-
plete stranger to most of those present, except by
reputation, and they called him a “sketch ” and
a “trick,” and other terms of appreciation that
were not in vogue when his Bath bun
was fresh baked. Spalding, of course, is as
true to-day as when he was translated
from the German original by Charles Hawtrey,
and first performed by Penley, from whom Frank
Thornton took the conception. He is less numer-
ous than of yore, but he still exists in the wildly
farcical state, and even in his more manly develop-
ments he shows many points of resemblance to the
go-loshed curate. Thornton, in the name part, is
the whole strength of this revival of “The Private
Secretary.” Formerly he was supported, in a
way of speaking, by some of the men who threw
him about, but the surrounding characters are
now out of date, and the present exponents have
not brought any striking individuality into the
business. All the same, they are a sufficiently
capable company, and the maiden aunt, who takes
the Rev. Robert seriously, is an improvement on
the orthodox eccentric spinster of farcical comedy.

At Her Majesty’s, the Pimpernel of Scarlet
hue will be embroidered on the undergarments of
Britain’s proudest daughters for one more week,
after which the Frenchmen who speak English
irreproachably and the Frenchwomen who don’t
will be removed to Germany, where the kraut
comes from. “ The Prisoner of Zenda ”is in re-
hearsal, and will follow “The Scarlet Pimpernel ”
in due course. Both plays are stage adaptations
of romantic novels, and “Zenda” is the better
adaptation of the better novel. Therefore Provi-
dence, as represented by the Williamson firm, will
temper the wind to the shorn lambs when they
lose their Julius Knight in his Scarlet Pimpernel
capacity and get him again as the Red Elphburg.
Meanwhile the lambs are unshorn, and the per-
fume of the Pimpernel is rife in the land.

At Melbourne Princess’s the final week of
“ The Prince of Pilsen ” differs from previous
weeks, insofar that Parkes has stepped into the
boots of Myles Clifton, who is just now helping to
tame a Shrew in Sydney. The difference weakens
the performance in a small degree—so small
that it practically makes no difference.
On Saturday, for one week only, “The Belle of
New York ” will return to favor, and the elder
Bronson—a practical moralist for whom The
Bulletin has a strong, irreverent liking—will
express his paternal interest in his prodigal son
by absorbing most of the giddy female temptations
that beset the young man’s career.
Last Saturday night the Welsh Male Choir
commenced a series of five concerts at Melbourne
Grlaciarium, the building being transformed into a
temporary concert hall by filling in the skating
space with timber leavings, seats, and a flag-
draped platform. The effect wasn’t very beauti-
ful—it looked rather cheap and circus-like—but
the Welshmen justified the reckless expenditure
in flags and chopped forest. They attracted a
surprisingly big audience—either for national or
educational reasons—and warbled with the tender
richness of a distant band.

At Melbourne King’s, the unaudacious
“ Female Swindler ” is nightly embraced by her
purity-haunted ’tec., and becomes perfectly honor-
able ever after. Thus, should she develop into a
flat-buzzumed Salvationist, with leanings to the
blue garb and similarly-tinted testimonies of the
cult, this paper wouldn’t be astounded. She
shows traces of religious hysteria in her molten
outpourings, and has a solid second in the ’tec.,
whose Band of Hope training gives him the con-
spicuousness of a person suffering from a super-
fluity of warts. “The Night Birds of London”
will fly in next Saturday and leave a mixed heap
of bodies, maledictions, and last night’s corks all
over the crimson premises.

The crowd that is gripped by picture craze
saw the solar system frivolling at Melbourne
Olympia on Saturday night. The planets and
sundries were represented by gentlemen in
character and by ladies in little more, and shot
past on the cambric, seated upon highly-colored
asteroids and other old things. Also the history
of Wilbur Wright’s experiments with his aeroplane
was faithfully and sometimes flickerlessly set
forth upon the West screen.

Wirth’s Circus has at length departed
from Wirth’s Park, that used to be Princes Court,
but fresh features to allure the retiring multitude
have been already announced. Phil Wirth is
providing an exhibition of breaking and training
horses; Carl Willheim is showing how wild
beasts are subjugated ; while Guillaume and
Josephi, eccentric comedians, Peter Tourcher,
elephant instructor, plus a number of other
attractions, appear to be substantial reasons why
35., 2s. and Is. should be asked for the privilege
of looking on. With the sideshows of the old
original Court offering themselves gratis to all
who enter at the outer gates, the park of Wirth
Bros, promises to achieve popularity as a Mel-
bourne summer resort.

Nothing very new and exhilarating hap-
pened at Melbourne Opera House on Saturday.
True, Ted Kalman came in with some passable
patter and one passable song, but he spoke mostly
about beer, which is an old, brown subject at best.
Osborn and Brooks shot in for a brief season with
a rather ragged sketch, and the Marionettes
changed their venue from a boarding-house bed-
room to a sylvan dell, wherein capered two cullud
coons, one delirio-chronic female, and some odd
sundries. However, the present firmament of
Rickards makes one eye-weary. It looks second-
hand and is minus phenomena. But certain stage
comets are to spread their fiery tails across the
heavens on Saturday next.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Whoever is responsible for the details of “ The Taming
of the Shrew ” has made a large geographical “ bloomer.’’
Shakspeare places the scene “sometimes at Padua,
and sometimes at Petruchio’s house in the country.”
Padua is an inland town, yet in the Sydney Royal version
of the comedy we are shown “ Padua, before Baptista’s
House ”as a garden on the seashore of the Adriatic. One
might as well expect to enjoy surf-bathing at Parra-
matta. Probably the responsible person would retaliate
that the Bard himself was very groggy on geography,
and in “ A Winter’s Tale ” makes Bohemia a
coastal country. This difficulty was surmounted
by Charles Kean in his revivals at London Princess’s in
the ’fifties by turning Bohemia into Bithynia, an old
time sea-coast Roman province in Asia Minor. In order
to justify the introduction of Shakspeare’s bear in this
scene, Keane quoted freely from the Bible to show there
were bears in Bithynia. But Bohemia was once a far
greater country than it is now, and it had a coastline at
a certain stage of its history, so the Bard might
have been allowed to stand. Last year’s revival
of “Romeo and Juliet” at the London Lyceum made
Verona (another Italian inland town) a bustling seaport,
with galleons, ships, etc. Perhaps it is the fashion now
to improve on the geography of the Bard. Even Old
Granny Herald, who ought to know better, enthused
over Baptista’s “ lovely Italian garden on the seashore.”
“ Vulcan ” : Ellen Terry, in her memoirs, explains that
allegedly very violent sundering—the break-up of the
famous and lengthy Irving-Terry combination: “ Henry
Irving did not treat me badly. I did not treat him
badly. He revived ‘Faust’ and produced ‘Dante.’ I
would have liked to stay with him to the end of the
chapter, but I could not act in either of these plays. But
we never quarrelled. Our long partnership dissolved
naturally. It was all very sad, but it could not be
helped.” ’Tis this same just “ could not be helped ” that
seems to have pursued Ellen through life. Everything
that happened just happened inevitably, and she was
mere fluff in the wind. Yet, spite of the variety and
close-packedness of this “everything,” to know Ellen
Terry was to love her and value her friendship to the end.
Irving was no exception to this influence, and even the
affronted artist Watts held to the last a warm heart-
corner for his one-time girl-wife.
Gertrude Elliott, Agnes Thomas, and Edward Sass, all
of good (though not recent) repute in Australia, and
Alice Crawford, the young Victorian from Bendigo, have
good parts in Jerome’s new play, “The Passing of the
Third Floor Back.” Forbes Robertson, Miss Elliott’s
husband, plays, without any make-up, a mysterious
visitor who can be taken as the founder of the Christian
religion! Barrie’s fairly serious play, “What Every
Woman Knows,” includes Edmund Gwenn aud Lillah
McCarthy. Marie Lohr is the heroine in “ Faust,” which,
as re-arranged by Beerbohm Tree, is the spectacular
success of the moment in London, and Edyth Latimer is
“the other woman” in W. J. Locke’s “Idols.” “The
King of Cadonia,” a musical comedy, is the only present
London novelty with a cast in which Australians find no
familiar names.
“ Sr.” : Have you remarked the “ Salome dance,” now
the rage of London, Paris and Vienna ? If it ever strikes
Australia there will be some shocked and hysterical yelps
from “Pro Bono Publico,” “Paterfamilias,” and “A
Mother of Many.” I saw a photo of an exponent of the
new whirl in a production which issues under the name
of the Bystander. It was bewildering. Tinselled
rosettes over her breasts, a pair of glorified swimming
trunks, some odd diamonds and jewels, an unlimited
quantity of delicious well-developed woman, with the
end of her draped in a gauzy material more trans-
parent than the glass in which the prophet saw
things darkly—these made up the costume. No shoes,
nothing else. I don’t know what the Salome dance is
like, and I don’t care. If it is up to the dancer things
will hum.
“ Hiphen”: The latest musical-comedy atrocity, “The
Prince of Pilsen,” has one redeeming feature. It is
honest. There is nothing hypocritical about it. It
doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn’t. It doesn’t
worry about a plot. It doesn’t profess to have any con-
secutive story, or any thing at all —except girl. It has girl
in large quantities. It is openly an admixture of panto-
mime and variety show, with the usual thin, watery love-
interest like a piece of frayed twine holding the whole
rickety conglomeration together. Nor does it take itself
seriously. For instance, a girl, apropos of nothing, sud-
denly goes to the wings, picks up a couple of large oyster-
shells, shows them to her boy and then, putting them
down, starts singing a song, the words of which seem to
be mostly “Ah-h-h-h!” and “ Oh—-Ho-o-o ! ” or some-
thing to that effect. Presumably she is singing about
oyster-shells. Voltaire said that anything too foolish to
be said could be sung. The fiend who was responsible for
“ The Prince of Pilsen ” evidently believed in Voltaire.
“Adelaide”: The statement (B. 19/11/’08) that the
late F. H. Pollock, of Adelaide Royal, “knew more about
theatre-managingin Australia thananyother man around
these parts,” is likely to give annoyance in several
quarters ; and F.H.P. himself would have been the last to
make such a claim. Surely “in Asia” was meant? [lt
was.] Pollock theatre-managed up there for years before
coming to Australia. Titheradge was under his manage-
ment when commissioned by the Viceroy to read aloud
the proclamation that Victoria Regina was henceforth
going to call herself Empress of India. Pollock and
Titheradge came to Australia in the same ship.
“0.K.”: Some Bulletin remarks on the moth-eaten
humor of “She Stoops to Conquer,” with an incidental
question as to whether Australian audiences ought to be
blamed for thinking the old comedy “ dead slow,” have
provoked a fervent protest from “ L.E.,” who, by the
way, admits that he didn’t see the production which
called forth the remarks he protests against. Did he ever
see any performance of “ She Stoops to Conquer ”? And
does he regard Goldsmith’s “ sweetness and graciousness
and charm of style ” as the whole art of playwriting and
the essential oil of humor? “L.E.’s” knowledge of
classic works of English fiction is probably not greater
than that of the other Bulletin writer who, judging
Goldsmith’s comedy from a dramatic critic’s point of
view, fails to see any sweetness, graciousness or charm in
a broadly farcical scene between Tony Lumpkin and his
mother. Had Goldsmith not been the author of “ The
Vicar of Wakefield,” “ The Deserted Village,” and “ The
Citizen of the World,” his comedy might not have lived
many years on the stage. Within my recollection Australia
has proved indifferent to three revivals of “ She Stoops.”
The Brough-Boucicault co. had no great success with it.
Mrs. Potter and Kyrle Bellew tried it in vain. The recent
performance at Melbourne Royal was respectfully received
for a fortnight on the strength of its author’s literary
reputation. It is an old-fashioned farcical comedy peopled
by characters that are now out of type in human nature ;
therefore the situations, which were strained to the limit
of possibility 150 3' ears ago, are now impossible. That’s
all. “ L.E.” betrays his ignorance of dramatic literature
when he says, “There are already more spots on
‘ Camille,’ and ‘ The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,’ two
vaunted modern productions, than in ‘ She Stoops to
Conquer.’ ... What could be staler, more out of date
than the latest London success?” “Camille,” which
lives only as a medium for the display of emotional act-
ing by actresses who challenge comparison with their
contemporaries in the name part, is a melodrama, just
sixty years old. “Mrs. Tanqueray” is a play of pecu-
liarly painful interest, too painfully convincingin its chief
episodes and its denouement to be acceptable to pleasure-
seekers. It is about 17 years old, and the moth of time
has not yet touched it. Where are the spots that “L.E.”
speaks of ? As for the latest London success, which is
“stale and out of date,” he doesn’t put a name to it. If he
means “ The Scarlet Pimpernel,” he is sneering at a lively
melodrama, dressed in the costumes of 1796. Nobody
calls it a good piny. But to the majority of people it is
more interesting than Goldsmith’s “ dead slow ” comedy.
“ Cockaigne ”: “ The Private Secretary ”is only called
a farce, and it gets outrageously farcical. The original is
“The Bibliothekar,” or Librarian, a German comedy
written by Moser. Of course, there is no curate in the
original ; the hero is a bookworm. The piece having
great vogue in Germany, Hawtrey took it up. He saw
no leading part for himself, but he hastily staged
it on the off-chance, lest some other manager
might get hold of it. Himself in the background,
he thought the best part might prove to be either the
tailor, entrusted to Anson, or Cattermole, acted by the
big fat gentleman known as Primrose Hill. As for the
Curate, acted by Beerbohm-Tree, nobody had an idea
that he would shine out. Well, the piece failed. Anson
could make nothing of the supposed capital vulgar tailor,
willing to give credit to get into Society. Hill was all
right as Cattermole, but the piece wouldn’t revolve round
him. Tree then started to work up the Curate, like
Sothern with Dundreary. The outcome was triumph.
Tree handed the character to the equally good but
strangely different tiny Penley. Hawtrey made £BO,OOO.
Thornton rushed off to New York with the piece, and did
200 nights at the little Madison Square playhouse.
“ 10-2-4 ” : There are more anachronisms, solecisms and
the like in “The Lily of Killarney'” than in any half-
dozen shows I have sat through in recent years. The
action of the opera occurs, by the costuming of it, some-
where about the middle of the 18th century. Yet in
Act 11. the na Ooppaleen person is discovered striking wax
matches on the side of his pipe. Matches didn’t appear
till well on in the 19th century. In the Castle scene the
male chorus repeatedly announces its intention of attend-
ing a steeplechase. The first steeplechase (it occurred
as a result of a freakish bet made by some officers
in a hussar regiment stationed at Colchester, England,
that they would ride in a dead-straight line from the out-
skirts of the town to a hamlet five miles away, using
the steeple of the village church as a mark) took place
less than 70 .years ago. The Danny Mann of Sydney
Cri. wears a sou’wester hat. The 18th century salt knew
no such luxury. The alleged hunting-men in the “ Kil-
larney ” show affect low-necked costumes. No sportsman
of the period would have dared to sally forth aboard a
horse on a “ hunting morn ” without a stock that reached
to his ears. The peasants at the Criterion talk the
purest variety of stage-English. In is only in compara-
tively recent years that the average Irish peasant has
dropped the Gaelic and taken to the tongue of the hated
Sassenach. John Wren needs a working antiquary these
days.
A CONVULSION OF NATURE.
[For The Bulletin.]
Ola Jane Humphrey and Julius Knight have not been
such a deliriously happy family that they are not prepared
to part for a space. Beatrice Day will lead with Julius in
place of the fair Ola, as soon as the term of the latter’s
engagement is up.— News item.
Of late there has been trouble midst the stars
That twinkle in the firmament of Knight,
Worry with leading female planets mars
The Julius smile, which is the girls’ delight.
All well, however, now, since people say
That for the future Knight will turn to Day.

“ Sceneshifter ”:“ Is ‘ The Merry Widow ’as young as
She says?” is the heading of a long article in New York
Theatre. The answer is “ No,” and the writer argues,
very convincingly too, that “ The Widow” is a crib as
regards plot from Meilhac’s “ L’ Attache D’ Ambassade,”
produced at the Paris Vaudeville in 1861. A German
version is known as “ The Embassy Attache.” A com-
parison of the printed French play with the libretto of
“The Merry Widow ” undoubtedly reveals a remarkable
similarity in plot and dialogue. The characters and
situations are astonishingly alike. The writer also argues
that the music is old, and refers the sceptic to the music
of the waltz of the opera “ Le Paradis De Mahomet,”
composed by Robert Planquette, of “Les Cloches de
Corneville” celebrity. The waltzes, it is claimed, are
similar in melody, harmony and rhythm. It is alsq
claimed that the chorus bf the Maxim song is almost
identical in theme, rhythm and harmony with an old folk
song, “Chanson Provencale,” composed years before the
play. All these statements came out in court before
Judge Ward, of the U.S. Bench, when Henry Savage
lately tried to stop a vaudeville performer, Gertie Hoff-
man, from doing “The Merry Widow.” The Judge
questioned the complainant’s title, and declined to
suppress Gertie, as requested.
“Vulcan”: A Cold Country writer has been working
out the average sumptuous screw of the British mummer,
and the result begets the lurking suspicion that histrionic
talent is developed on a rice diet. An appended balance-
sheet discloses that the average provincial Hamlet earns
a lordly 455. weekly. Even this wouldn’t be so bad were
the employment fairly constant, but, owing to the intru-
sion of Christmas panto, at one end, and the midsummer
“off-season” at the other, the alleged wealth is prac-
tically limited to 30 weeks per annum. Thus the embryo
Keene and Siddons allegedly live, clothe, and arrogantly
strut on a munificent £67 10s. per year! How it’s done
the writer doesn’t profess to know ; but he says there are
depths of pay far lower than even this, and he advocates
‘ ‘ an agitation to secure a minimum wage." But the person
whom an annual £67 10s. hasn’t goaded into something
desperate seems pretty helpless for agitating purposes.
“ Melb.” : I can never sufficiently admire the business-
like fashion in which the orchestra people in Melbourne
run their little trade-union. It is indeed a cold day now
when the music-makers get left. They must be paid
absolutely first, else the band is up and away. Then’not
one man is to be got. The last stuck-up manager here
had to go in the street and fetch in pavement-players—
hurdy-gurdy men, whistle-tooters, and the cat-chorus
tribe. The orchestras of the Princess’s, Her Majesty’s,
the Royal, Opera House, King’s, and Bijou form one
solid combination, besides all the players at other func-
tions. The office is in Russell-street. It is wonderful
what power the association has exercised when big
orchestras came to be formed, such as the Opera, Mar-
shall-Hall’s, Beard’s, etc. The bootmakers are not more
compact. Our Australian actors and actresses ought
also to be able to combine, and make the imported mum-
mer join the union before his first appearance. As for
the vaudeville folk, there is such a long and tattered tail
at the end of them that a union of the song-and-dance
people would seem impossible except perhaps on the
policy of requiring proof of an appearance at a first-rate
Sydney or Melbourne house as a qualification.
The Oscar Asche co.'s visit to Australia, under Meynell
and Gunn management, is a very expensive venture.
There are to be 12 imported members of the co. apart
from Asche and his clever wife, Lily Bray ton. Also the
sta£e fixings for at least six plays will be shipped with the
co * sometime about the middle of next year.
People who ask questions sometimes get
answers they don’t want, and that seems to he
the accident that happened to Sydney Tele-
graph. Its London correspondent wrote to it,
under date Oct. 1, giving the opinion of “a very
high authority” on the possibility of building
small war-vessels in Australia, and this is what
the authority said :
I say without hesitation that within three months all
the plant necessary for building the proposed submarines
and torpedo-boats could be got together in England and
shipped to Australia. Arrived in Australia, it could be
established in a few weeks. The cost of establishing the
necessary yard would be small. I think lam well within
the mark if I say it would not cost more than £25,000.
The “authority” pours deserved contempt on
those people who have answered similar inquiries
with the statement that the one shipbuilding
place in the world is Britain. It is added that,
whether Australia builds the boats or not, it will
have to establish a repairing yard. Boats of light
material, built for speed, have constantly to go
into a yard for repair, and it would be impossible
to send the cripples to a yard on the other side of
the world.
The Labor Government came in with an
ex-miner as Treasurer and an ex-hatter as Minister
of Customs, and readers of Sydney daily papers
missed an old friend—there wasn’t any snort of
indignation concerning the Labor fellows’ “utter
ignorance of finance.” The fact was that the
Labor fellows had arrived at a most awkward
time, when William McMillan, the arch-represent-
ative of the “ experienced financier,” the man to
whom the daily papers always pointed as the sort
of person who ought to be at the Treasury, was very
busy over a bankruptcy matter. He happened to
have been chairman and practically manager of a
big concern, the Farmers and Settlers’ Society,
Ltd., which has come to awful smash ; and there
are circumstances which some of the creditors
think want a whole lot of explanation. So with
their little tin financial god in that box, the daily
papers carefully and silently dropped the old gag
down a hole somewhere.
Wonderful how philosophically the old
Tory papers can sometimes regard the ravening
tiger Socialism. The S. M. Herald, for instance,
said on the penny-a-word cable proposal:—
The percentage earnings of the private cable companies
are not so very great after all ; but if the price of the
services which they render can be materially reduced by
public ownership, then the case is made out for
public ownership. We doubt, however, whether such
proof will be forthcoming. If it is, however, we shall
accept the position. The benefits of cheap cable com-
munication are sufficiently great and sufficiently obvious
to be worth substantial subsidies from the Common-
wealth.
It is quite prepared to let the tiger in, just to see
if he will bite ; and if, instead of biting, he gives
the S. M. Herald very cheap cables, “we shall
accept the position.” Our colonial oath—we just
shall !
It is in the country districts that the
Labor party is made to suffer worst for the appal-
ling foolishness of the Tom Manns and their loose-
tongued dupes. At the three by-elections in Vic-
toria Labor polled fairly well against Downward
in Mornington and Bowser in Wangaratta ; but
in the Upper Goulburn the result was galling.
The electors were asked to choose between Hunt,
the wearisome nonentity who has vegetated in'the
Assembly for two decades to no purpose, and is
now tethered to Bent; McKenzie, the man who
was practically drummed out of the Irvine Minis-
try ; and Norman McLeod, the brainy, young
exponent of the democratic platform, pledged
beyond all chance of treachery, and belonging to
a party entirely free from all suspicion of jobbery
and bribery. Biit that party has to carry the
extravagances of the Tom Manns on its shoulders ;
and so McLeod got only 197 votes to Hunt’s 1142
and McKenzie’s 914.
Adolphus Bent’s latest policy speech was
as barren as his previous one was prolific—in pro-
mises. Practically his only proposals are the
more liberal treatment of settlers, the limitation
of large estates, the extension of the Wages Board
system to miners, a (snuffle here) Scripture
Referendum Bill, and the pushing of the Adult
Suffrage Bill through the House of Fat. Skimpy
and meagre as the programme is, Adolphus has
already started to hack away a slice of it by
stating that the Limitation of Estates Bill (£50,000
worth of land to be the limit and 20 years’ time to
get rid of the surplus) will be postponed till next
session.
Arthur Renwick, M.L.C., knight and
medico, died last Monday, aged 72. He was a
manitif standing in the medical world, and took a
vigorous interest in many philanthropic move-
ments. As a politician he belonged to the heavy-
going, unprogressive Parkes school. He got his
knighthood with difficulty, and valued it greatly.
He put in about seven years in the N.S. W. Assem-
bly and 21 in the Council, and by strange luck he
was a Minister during almost the whole of his
career as M.L.A. Hoskins, Windeyer, Robert
Wisdom, John Lackey, and Stephen Brown were
some of the other component parts of the first
Cabinet in which Dr. Renwick labored.
AT “THE TAMING OF THE SHREW.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was magnificently done, and the great audience in-
stantaneously acclaimed its approval by thunderous and
sustained applause. ... The gifted actress simply carried
the vast audience by storm. ... It was strongly, splen-
didly done. The great audience just shrieked and
gasped, and shrieked again. —Sydney Star Critique,
ssmros.
I never heard that uproar. No. And yet
I sat there in a stall, my ears attuned
To ev’ry sound around me. Coughs I heard
And whisperings what time Lucentio
Wooed his Bianca by the marble seat
In old Baptista’s garden. Whiles I caught
A shrewdly critic word or two anent
The morals and coiffures of certain dames,
Who glittered on my right and dexter hands,
And once, as on a summer breeze, was borne
Unto mine ears the burning words, “ Old man,
What say you to a drink ? ” This last occurred
Even as Kolker “ strongly, splendidly,
Carried away his bride.” The speaker wore
(Methought) a strangely dullard look. I’ faith,
Had one not known the thing incredible,
One had condemned him straight as mumchance knave
Who found himself a-weary with the Bard.
No one in my vicinity shrieked out;
The raptured yell that aye greets “ Charley’s Aunt,”
The wild convulsive snorts of joy were not.
Around me all was spectacles and gloom
And drear3 r quidnuncs prating of the past,
Where it was not irrelevant guffaws
And prayings for a speedy terminance,
And chat concerning golf and cards and such.
Certes, the critic’s ear’s beyond compare ;
It hears what is, and eke what isn’t there.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
. Those who are in the habit of attending vice-regal
xunctions are concerned to know whether or not it is
etiquette to curtsey to Governors and their wives. It
maj'be stated authoritatively that it is proper to curtsey
to the Govern.or-General or the State Governor, as their
Itxcelleneies are the direct representatives of his Majesty
the King. — Melbourne Punch.
Shall she grovel—
May she grovel
At his beautiful balmorals as he treads the holy floor
Where the scent of sacred hair-oil greets the stranger at
the door?
O, she wants to spread her splendors in a curtsey soft and
low! J
(But the awful, inward woe
When the silken stitches go
As the haughty, humble female crawls before her
Governor!)
“ Please permit me,
Sir, to sit me:
Very gently, Sir, and meekly on my leal and loyal heel,
In a curtsey gladly grov’ling with a hungry-eyed appeal
To your good and gracious lordship for your royal, cold
regard!
O, the casual bow is barred—
We must curtsey, good and hard !
When the Gov’nor comes in, godlike, why, I feel I want to
kneel! ’’)

SOCIETY
PENFOLD'S
WINES
Warrnamhool (Vic.) Council, which was
recently found guilty of leaving the Pure Foods
Act entirely unmolested, has had its neglect
punched home in a memorable fashion. A day or
two ago an inspector from the Board of Health
moved through the stagnant village, and then
fired in a heap of summonses. The charges were :
butcher, selling sausages without wrapper stating
how much preservatives they contained ; another
butcher, ditto, and also selling the same mysteries
with an excess of preservatives ; storekeeper, sel-
ling vinegar not up to standard : baker, selling
light-weight bread ; baker, leaving bread unpro-
tected from flies and dust; two milkmen, selling
milk not up to standard. Out of those eight
charges the inspector secured five convictions,
which isn’t by any means a bad beginning for a
small place like Warrnambooi.
NOT LOST—BUT GONE OVER.
GWENDOLINE: “ Where has Maudie got to?”
ETHEL: “We don’t know! We're looking for her.”
Through the energy and. perseverance of
D rs. Norris and Wood, the Municipal Councils of
Melbourne are at last doing something practical
in connection with the supply of pure milk to the
infants of poor parents. It is proposed that
between the months of December and April
specially supervised pure milk shall be distri-
buted bv a qualified and expert children’s nurse
to the mothers in Fitzroy, Collingwood, and
Richmond. Milk will be delivered sealed, and
with means for storing same so as to keep the cow
juice pure and fresh for 24 hours. Dr. Wood
explains that the impure supply of milk is respon-
sible for the departure to the Never-Never
country of thousands of Australian youngsters,
and that if the supply were properly supervised a
grand work could be done. Two of the councils
named have offered to financially support the
movement, which is called the Lady Talbot Milk
Institute. It is a good start, but it is only a short-
distance animal at the best, and doesn’t cover
the complete course by many furlongs.
The rare, occasional girl who disguises her-
self as a man might be fittingly employed in
throwing things at the males who masquerade as
girls. Three of these abnormal creatures have
been boldly advertising themselves in Melbourne
of late. One night they went to a theatre in full
feminine rig, and from the theatre passed to a
Collins-street cafe, where their antics invited
attention. In the street outside the cafe the trio
flaunted their flounces until they were chivvied
away. Melbourne, if it isn’t careful, will get
to be notorious for sex-lunacy ; and a man soon
won’t give up his seat to “ oblige a lady ” until he
has looked twice to make sure that Birdie isn’t
Bertie in disguise.
* * * *
The present N.S.W. State Government
seems to have a mania for legal process, and the
Costs it has piled up must be something mar-
vellous. In the single matter of a packet of
cigarettes it has run up a fine bill. One Hart,
lessee of the alleged central railway station re-
freshment rooms at Sydney, sold threepence worth
of cigarettes on a Sunday. The police prosecuted
him as a Sunday trader, and lost on the ground
that, as a lessee of the Commissioners, Hart was a
servant of the King, and as the King can do no
wrong, he can, through his agent, sell cigarettes on
theSabbathasoftenashelikes. Also, said themagis-
trate, the Railway Commissioners could stop any
Sunday selling on the part of their lessee if they
wanted to. The Crown appealed and the Judge
dismissed the appeal, with Costs against the
Crown, and also remarked that if the Crown
objected to cigarettes being sold on a Sunday, it
could, in its capacity as a Railway Commissioner,
tell Hart so. The Crown then appealed to the
Full Court as to whether its servant Hart or its
menial, the constable (one Kelly), was right. The
Court said Kelly’s conception of the law was
wrong (Costs against the Crown), and that if the
Commissioners wished Hart not to sell cigarettes
on Sunday there was no need for all this law and
Costs—they could simply speak to Hart. Justice
Simpson dissented here. He reckoned the case
should go against Hart (with Costs against the
Crown), as his lease only gave the lessee the right
to sell to (1) a railway traveller or (2) a friend
seeing him off or on. How the cigarette girl was
to tell a bona-fide railway traveller from a down-
right liar, who said he was going to Cobar when
in fact he was going to Surry Hills, Simpson
didn’t say. Wade, having had enough High
Court decisions on his silly points of law, has
appealed to the Privy Council. Now the case
will proceed to decide whether Hart should be
stopped selling cigarettes by fining him in the police
court or by inserting a prohibitive clause in his
lease. In any case there will be Costs against the
Crown.
An unusual case strayed into the limelight
recently. A short while back two Sydney
“ladies” were dancing on the footpath when a
bobbv-person tried to run them in. A Jack Tar
hastened to assist beauty in distress; another
bobby interfered ; more Jack interfered ; and
presently there were shovelsful of tars and bobbies
all interfering. In the middle of the disturbance
a policeman was smitten on the head with a
bottle of soda water, which hurtled from a
handy pub. He rushed in and captured a
Jack Tar from the Cambrian, and got
him a month’s gaol. Time rolled on,
and then a barmaid from the pub
called on the gold-laced captain
of the war-ship to say that it
was she who had thrown the
soda-water bottle, and, like
the lady that she was,
she had come to say so.
The publican, another
lady, also called to say
that when the row was
on, the arrested sailor
was sitting inside her
pub reading an article
on the Bulgarian situation
or something, and had no
idea of throwing soda-water
bottles at anybody. The first
lady added that she aimed the
bottle at a Jack Tar who was in
the middle of the serum, and really
wanted to help the police, and it was by
sheer bad luck that she had hit the wrong
hobby and got the wrong Jack Tar into gaol.
But by this time the sailor has finished his sen-
tence, and there seems very little use pursuing
the matter further.
Consider the backbone of the country and
the wages he pays ! In the Brisbane Supreme
Court, the other day, Alfred Ironmonger sued
his father, Francis Ironmonger, farmer, of Pine
Mountain. In 1892 Alfred, who is now 37 years
old, reckoned he had been working long enough
for tucker and clothes and a little pocket-money,
and asked dad for wages. Dad agreed to pay him
for his toil, and, provided he consented not to
draw any of the pay due to him till the mortgage
was paid off, promised to form the concern into a
co-operative co. and give him a share in it.
Should Alf prefer to draw his wages, he was to be
permitted to do so, but in that case he wasn’t to
get a share in the co. An agreement to this effect
was drawn up and duly signed. That was 16
years ago, but although the mortgage has been
paid off, sonny hasn’t been getting anything for
his work beyond the tucker and clothes and a few
pence to buy crackers with ; so the other day he
asked Justice Real to make dad keep the agree-
AFTER THE SEANCE.

ment, and give him one-third of the farm, or £lOOO
damages, or wages at the rate of £1 per week since
the signing of the agreement. Justice Real rec-
koned the pocket money up as well as he could,
and then gave a verdict for £135 and Costs, which
doesn’t seem much in the way of savings after 10
years’ steady toil for 13 hours or so a day.
“ Mallim ” : Allow me to second “Mate’s ”
suggestion (B. 22/10/’08) that you print a list of
vessels able to communicate by means of
Morse code (lamp) and semaphore (hand
flags). The ships would preferably be
Australian. However, such regular
traders to the Commonwealth as the E.
and A. Co., China Navigation Co.,
the P. and 0., Orient, and Liverpool
and Aberdeen White Star lines (all of
which are supplied with signalling ap-
paratus) might well be included. Entries
would follow in quick order. In my
opinion it should be compulsory for
Morse signalling lamps to be fitted on
all steamers other than mere “60-
milers,” and also supplied to the signal-
stations and lighthouses along our coast.
Such a system would be of immense
value in time of war. I have had a yarn,
by means of Morse lamp, with Wilson’s
Promontory lighthouse, but was unaware
that Rottnest Island, Green Cape and
Cape Cleveland were “ waggers.” Good
luck to them ! Herewith I add a few
names to “Mate’s” list of ships:—
Changsha, Taiyuan, Empire, Air-lie,
Guthrie and Aparima, all using the
Torres Strait route to the North, which
the daily press still calls “ the East.”
Maryborough, the little Victorian town-
ship that has hitherto been noted chiefly for
possessing about the most gorgeous railway station
on earth for a speck of its size, has now got a
mausoleum to match. At least, it will be one
when the occupant consents to go and camp there.
At present he pervades Warragul (Gippsland) in
the best of health, considering he has put 86 years
behind him. The tombstone, or whatever it is.
consists of a granite house, 14ft. square
and 10ft. high, on which stand four
square pillars supporting a granite dome.
On the dome are six round polished granite
pillars carrying a granite canopy, the top of
which rises 42ft. towards Heaven. The boss
occupant, who will lie 10ft. underground when he
gets there, will be W. G. McCullough, of Warra-
gul, an old Maryborough pioneer, and various
deceased relatives have already been placed on
their shelves to get the house warm for him, in a
manner of speaking. Also other relatives, not
yet deceased, may occupy niches when their time
arrives, should they feel like joining the family
party. The cenotaph isn’t quite as artistic as Dr.
Springthorpe’s memorial to his wife in Kew
Cemetery, which Bertram Mackennal sculpt, but
it would kill a bigger megatherium if it were
thrown at one, and Maryborough is proud of it.

ART, AS THE TAILOR
WOULD HAVE IT.
The Tailor and Cutter art critic paid his annual visit
to the Royal Academy exhibition (London), and regis-
tered his protest. “At last there is something new in
trousers,” says the keenly sarcastic critic, “portrayed on
no less a personage than the Right Hon. A. J. Balfour,
M.P. This consists of scolloped bottoms, with the effect
that a decided point appears at the bottom of the leg-
seam, which would, of course, be repeated at the side-
seam. A careful study of this picture shows that both
topsides and undersides are hollowed, with the result
that where the top and underside may be imagined to
join there is a point. We say ‘ imagined,’ for there is no
other evidence of a seam.” Nor is Mr. Balfour’s coat
more calculated to inspire confidence. “ Here is a states-
man,” says the indignant critic, “portrayed in black
somethings, which, by the general outline, we imagine is
intended to be a black frock coat suit. There is not a
button on it; it is innocent of button-holes, and, as for
seams, lapels, and such-like trifles, the artist will have
none of them.”
The streets of Adelaide are in a most
awful mess. The tramcars from the north get no
further into the city than North Terrace, and all
those from the east stop at the York. King
William-street is a wreck from the Victoria

had been bombarded by devils; but as it is gener-

Carpentaria Downs hadn’t a ruffle on its
placid cattle-raising’ existence for just about a
third of a century ; and then excitement came to
it all of a heap. The tourist doesn’t often drop
in on Carpentaria Downs-—only the lean bushmen
of the Gulf country know it, and an occasional
very venturesome prospector, and a few
blacks who have drifted down that way
from the fringe of the Gulf. (Up on the
top of Australia there is only one Gulf
—Carpentaria.) Hawkins, one of the occasional
very venturesome prospectors, supplied it with its
first excitement. A quiet man is Hawkins, now
of Charters Towers, and when he dropped
upon a patch of gold at the Oaks, which is
an out-station of Carpentaria Downs, he just
went on picking up gold—went on picking
up gold for close upon 18 months, in fact. Whom
could he trust? Well, there was “old Wilson,”
of Carpentaria ; so Hawkins took his gold into
Carpentaria, and “old Wilson,” the cattle man —
he has a big interest in the Ross River meat-
works too —put it in a safe place, and Hawkins
got his rations, and went back and picked up more
gold. He had got close on to 2000 oz. when the
accident happened, and a mate, wandering into
Georgetown, and fed up on North Queensland
rum, opened his mouth. Within a week there
were about 1000 men on the rush ; and Carpen-
taria Downs never had such a shaking-up in all
its dull old days. And now, just when the excite-
ment of that had cooled down (for, as Hawkins
knew, the Oaks was only a patch), there is a
murder in the house, Miss Duffy, the “lady’s
companion,” is found in bed with her throat cut,
and after'some delay Mrs. Wilson, wife of “the
boss” of Carpentaria, is arrested and charged
with the murder. It is the biggest sensation the
wire-and-whipcord Gulf country has ever had to
yarn about. So far it is all a horribly mixed busi-
ness ; but Billy, the black, swears in as positive a
way as unreliable Black Brother ever swears to
anything that he helped Mrs. Wilson to do it,
and he gives the Court a graphic pantomime of
the whole tragic business, and goes into detail
about how he held the dead woman’s wrists while
“the knife was being put in.” And now Billy,
having been a hero for a while, probably wonders
why they have arrested him too.

N.S.W. Justice Simpson lately refused
divorce to a lady on the ground that her hus-
band’s habit of regularly coming home drunk
between 1 and 2 a.m., and swearing at the wife of
his bosom, wasn’t cruelty within the meaning of
the Act; so the lady appealed. The Full Court
was sorry, but told the lady that, unless she could
show that her health actually suffered from these
little incidents, it would have to uphold Simpson
J.; so it returned the lady to her midnight
reveller till further notice. Besides, she had
only specified eight or nine acts of cruelty, the
Court remarked, including the regular late-hour
drunks aforesaid, threats of violence, slapping her,
spitting in her face, and other trifles, and the
Court could do nothing until the regular per-
sistence of these delicate attentions resulted in
the lady coming into court on a shutter, or some-
thing like that, when (the Court hopefully pro-
mised) the matter would be reconsidered. So, as
the law stands, you may brutally sear a woman,
mind and soul, and it doesn’t matter to the
Divorce Court —it only begins to matter when
some ill effect is produced on her body.
What becomes of all the old ships ? The
ancient horse is mercifully led out to the slaughter;
the worn-out machine is rifled of good parts
and then piled up on the scrap heap. But
what becomesof theoldships? Occasionally—
as with the Brightside in Sydney the other
day—-one hears of an ancient being con-
demned to be broken up; but not often.
Lloyd’s Register of Shipping, probably the
most perfect bit of statistics in the world, lets
some light into the mystery. In 1907, it
shows, the mercantile marine of the world
lost 356 steamers and 512 sailing vessels
(Lloyd’s can’t see anything smaller than 100-
ton craft). This meant 176 out of every 10,000
steamers and 544 out of every 30,000 sailing
vessels. So far, however, as Lloyd’s Register
is concerned, a vessel is lost when it dis-
appears from the list; so for general pur-
poses it has to further cut up the losses, and
that’s where light begins to come in on the
mystery of what becomes of the old ships.
For out of the subsequent statistics you can
dig the fact that only 236 per 1000 of all the
steamers that ceased to exist were con-
demned and broken up, and only 340 per
1000 of the sailing vessels. Thus for every
old steamer that was broken up peacefully,
more than three were wrecked, or stranded,
or just sank down and buried their tired
old bones in the sea; and compared with
those sailing vessels that were condemned,
twice as many were kept at work until
they couldn’t work any longer, and so
settled themselves down comfortably in
Davy Jones’ locker, and probably took their
crews with them. It looks a shuddersome
proportion.
The tale of a lawyer :
In Queensland Quok Yen lately fell among lawyers, and
probably Quok will never know exactly what happened
to him. He will never know, for instance, that he was
robbpd of his individuality as a human or meat Chinkey,
and transmogrified into a Legal Precedent, and that in
future he will be referred to darkly by men in horsehair
helmets as Rex v. Quok Yen, Q.L.R., vol. 3001, p. 9069, or
something. Quok’s misfortunes took root 25 years ago,
when he began to smoke opium, and they blossomed forth
luxuriantly the other day, when he bumped against the
Queensland Anti-Opium Act. To begin with, the Act cut
off Quok’s drug supply. Then Quok got ill as a result of
the shortage. Then Quok “saw a doctor,” and the
medico prescribed opium medicinally. And finally the
Law fell upon Quok for illegally possessing opium. Quok
was charged under the section which reads :
“It shall not be lawful for any person, not being a
legally-qualified medical practitioner, or a pharmaceuti-
cal chemist, or a wholesale dealer in drugs to .. ( have
or keep in his possession any opium for any purpose
whatever.”
The section is a luminous bit of draughtsmanship, and
to the ordinary lay brand of intellect seems to insinuate
that doctors and chemists may keep opium to play with,
if they like, or they may sell opium, if they please, but
they mustn’t sell it to anyone, because the purchaser
would immediately become liable for possessing the drug
illegally. Quok’s only visible defence appeared to be a
plea that he didn’t have the opium “for any purpose
whatever,” and there seemed a dreadful possibility that
“What is a purpose?” would become in Queensland
the same sort __ of daymare that “ What is a
place?” is in N.S.W. The Court perspired long
and learnedly over Quok and his opium, and
then said that it was blowed if it knew what the section
meant, but it didn’t mean that anyway, and it shoo-ed
the human or flesh}'Quok hurriedly off the premises. The
astral or legal Quok (or whatever he is) was drafted into
the court library and stacked among- the other prece-
dents : and at intervals in the coming centuries Quok will
arise and stalk forth cheerfully, and many Costs will
dance around Quok.
The prohibited degree of affinity as re-
gards marriage came up twice last week in
Sydney. In the first case a man desired to marry
his deceased wife’s sister’s daughter. The Angli-
can Archbishop refused permission on the ground
that the Deceased Wife’s Sister Act doesn’t include
the deceased wife’s sister’s daughter, and an uncle
and niece (by marriage) are on the Church’s list of
prohibited degrees. The Registrar-General re-
fused a civil marriage on the ground that the
D.YV.S. Act doesn’t alter the law as far as
a man and his widow’s niece are concerned.
In South Australia this obvious point was
thought of, and S.A. is the only State
that did think of it. Further, a marriage
in S.A., if legal there, is legal in N.S.W. So the
man who can’t marry his wife’s niece in N.S.W.
can marry her in S.A.. and then he can return
to his old home in Sydney as a lawful husband.
The second case was a suit for nullity of marriage
against a woman who had wedded her deceased
husband’s brother. The D.H.B. was the
petitioner, and he moved for a rule absolute.
In annulling the marriage, the Divorce Judge
made some severe remarks about the D. H. 8.,
but, owing to the state of the law, the remarks
were all that he could throw at the mean brother.

Bitter language from a lawyer :
Payten, a Sydney magistrate sitting at Redfern on
November 19, had before him a lady publican accused of
Sunday-trading. A policeman saw a man pass a bag
through a window of the lady’s pub. Later on he saw
the bag handed out to the same mart through another
window. The bag contained full bottles of beer. The
policeman took the man to the pub and demanded infor-
mation. On the counter he found a funnel, wet with fresh
beer, also wet marks into which he fitted the bottles out
of the bag. The case looked bad for Mrs. Publichouse,
until her lawyer got to work. There was, he held, no
proof that the man had not, just for amusement, handed
in the bag full of beer through one window, and received
it, full of the same beer, out of the other, the pub people
having carried the beer from one window to another for
exercise. Instead of committing the lawyer for con-
tempt of court, Payten enthusiastically embraced the
idea that a strange man would probably spend the Sab-
bath passing bags of beer in at the window of a hotel, and
that the inmates vvould pass the Sabbath handing them
out again. So Payten dismissed the case. It was a
lamentable essay on the credulity of the law.
THE GILDED BEER-ENGINEER’S STORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A curious and amusing partial strike of barmaids
occurred in Nelson hotels yesterday, owing to a manifesto
by three local brewers promising to prohibit the employ-
ment of barmaids in their tied houses as a condition of
future leases.
The girls were very indignant, and did their best to
dissuade people from drinking local beer ; consequently,
less local beer was consumed in a day than for many
years past.
In one free house the landlady cut off the pipes from
the casks containing local beer, cancelle'd orders for
aerated waters and cordials from local brewers, and drew
only southern ale.
The position is less acute to-day, but the semi-boycott
of local beer continues in a mild for w.—Maoriland news
item.
Will I tell you the story ? Why, yes, sir.
(Kid, let my hand go ! Don’t you dare !)
I’d been working twelve months and no less, sir
(Wait a jiff while I tidy my hair !),
And I’d taken some trade with me there, sir,
And a good class of trade it was, too ;
For you must know I never did care, sir,
For the general fast-living crew.
(Yes, I will smack your face if you do.)
I was careful to keep my bar nice, sir.
(No, I won’t smile again 1 Let me go !)
And no customer had to ask twice, sir,
For I never was stupid or slow.
And if anyone swore and went on, sir—
Well, I soon cleared him out of the place,
And I said to the boss when they’d gone, sir,
That I’d let no man swear to my face.
(Yes, you are ! You’re a perfect disgrace.)
Tho’ I say it myself, I worked well, sir
(Now I told you before to stop that!).
And I never heard anyone tell, sir,
That they’d waited while I had a chat
With a very particular friend, sir,
For I don’t hold with that sort of game.
(What is yours, please ? A drop of the blend, sir ?
And yours, too, please ? Will you have the same ?
Beg your pardon ? ... It has a good name.)
There ! They’re gone now, and I can go on, sir
(Oh !do stop it! You are such an ass !).
My old Boss said the sun never shone, sir,
On a smarter, more wide-awake lass ;
But the house, by bad luck it was tied, sir,
And one morning the Boss told me how —
And I tell you straight out that I cried, sir—
When he said : “ Florrie ! Don’t make a row !
I am forced to get rid of you now 1 ”
Well, he tried to explain it to me, sir,
How it was that the thing came about.
For the life of me I couldn’t see, sir,
Why the brewery should throw me out.
For I’d always worked hard as I could, sir,
So I told the Boss straight, “I won’t go ;
I ivon’t go 1 I don’t see why I should, sir !
And I’ll strike ! It’s no use saying ‘No ! ’
And, look here ! Don’t you dare call me ‘ Flo !’ ”
And I was just as good as my word, sir,
For I drew not a pint of their beer ;
And the boys all agreed ’twas absurd, sir,
So they found me this billet in here ;
And the work isn’t near half as hard, sir,
Tho’ the Boss growls a bit when he’s tight.
(Yes, the bar door is bolted and barred, sir 1)
Oh ! I’m sure that I must look a sight!
Now you’ll have to clear out, Kid ! Good-night.

THE RESIGNED REID.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Reid onfy resigned the position when it became
plain to all that the position was resigning Mr. Reid. —A
Melbourne enemy.
The leader stood upon a hill,
Proud, eminent, alone ;
Adown the slope with eager will
His followers had flown.
The last of them was still in sight,
But speeding- off with all his might.
The leader looked to right and left.
The land was grim and rude.
Of even ancient foes bereft,
He stood in solitude.
The hot tears from his ey r elids leapt,
He bowed his splendid head and wept.
“ Now have I through this bitter land
In loneliness to jog,
Forsaken by my trusty band—
Aye, even by my dog.
Revenge is mine! ” He smote his hip,
“ I will resign my leadership !”

1908.. 172,560 63,882 11,000 188,565 90,897
These figures are as disgraceful as usual, and expose, or
partly expose, a confidence-trick which is being played on
J. Bull, money-lender. When Bigjohn Forrest agreed to
carry out this great undertaking for the supply of water
to the goldfields, he most properly decided upon a 3 per
cent, sinking fund. He knew that the best gold-mines
in the world are comparatively short-lived, especially in
these days when engineers hold that the right thing is to
rip the gold out quickly, and not leave it in the mines,
where it can’t earn interest; so he provided that the
mines should pay the capital cost or a good part of it
back during their lifetime. On that understanding J.
Bull lent him the money. Yet, as a matter of solemn
fact, the deficit exceeds the sinking fund : that is to say,
so far from providing a sinking fund, the scheme did not
actually last year pay even its own interest.
The Goldfields Water Scheme is controlled by a
Board ; hut the liability for what is known as the main
capital—the loans raised by the State —has not been
transferred to the Board. These loans total £2,874,500.
In addition, £352,000 of what is known as supplementary
capital has been raised by the Board itself on the security
of debentures, and spent on works. Thus, though about
£3,225,000 altogether has been spent on the under-
taking, the Board’s balance-sheet shows total figures
of only £421,365. It is an absurd arrangement.
Still the present accounts, forwarded by the Board,
are a great improvement on those hitherto avail-
able, and published partly in the Board’s annual report
and partly in the Auditor-General’s annual report. For
some of the earlier years it has been impossible, in fact,
to complete the figures.
In the past five years, as the table shows, there
has been a total deficit of £436,021. This, of course, is
after charging up interest and the statutory sinking fund.
The next table separates the interest and the sinking
fund :
Sinking
June, Interest. Fund. Total.
1904 .. £83,952 £71,959 £155,911
1905 .. 94,792 84,240 179,032
1906 .. 96,565 85,152 181,717
1907 .. 100,272 86,517 186,789
1908 .. 102,123 86,442 188,565
The sinking fund required in the five years was thus
£414,310 ; and as the total deficit has been £436,021, it
follows that in this period the scheme has paid no sinking
fund whatever, and has also loafed on the general tax-
payer to the extent of £21,711 for interest. That is to
say, the mostly-absentee mining cos., which have averaged
about £2,000,000 a year in dividends, have done the loafing.
Sympathy poured out on the general taxpayer
of Westralia would, however, be wasted, because, as a
matter of fact, he also has been loafing on somebody
else. This shows the State’s revenue and expenditure for
the same five years:—
Revenue. Expenditure. Deficit.
1904 .. £3,550,016 £3,698,312 £148,296
1905 .. 3,615,340 3,745,224 129,884

1908 .. 3,376,641 3,379,006 2,365
The total State deficit for the five years has thus been
£442,752. Thus not only has the State loafed on the
next generation (the generation that won’t have the rich
mines of Kalgoorlie, etc., to tap) for the whole of the
Goldfields Water Supply sinking fund, and £21,711 of the
interest, but for £6731 besides. These deficits have, of
course, had to be made up by borrowings ; so that Wes-
tralia, which promised J. Bull to provide a 3 per cent,
sinking fund, has actually borrowed from J. Bull, or
someone else, the whole of that sinking fund, and
£28,442 of the interest besides. It is an utterly scan-
dalous state of affairs.

This bank in 1892 had a paid capital of £900,000 in 45,000
shares of £2O each. The next year the then common
trouble happened, and the reserves (£310,000) and £lO
per share of the capital were written off. Another £l2
10s. was called up, and another £lO was written off.
To-day, therefore, the shares are paid to £l2 10s., and
they carry a liability for a further £l2 10s. ; but through
forfeitures the 45,000 shares have been reduced to 43,155.
When the trouble occurred the worst was not realised,
and another reconstruction had to follow in 1896. Since
that date the old liability has been got rid of to this
extent: —

No. 1 carries 4 per cent., and is repayable at the bank’s
option at 5 per cent, premium. The terminable receipts
carried 4 per cent. ; they have all gone. No. 3 carries
3 per cent. ; No. 4 carries 3 per cent., which may be in-
creased to 4J per cent., and the larger amount has been
paid since 1900. Net profits are divided this way : first,
£15,000 a year to reserves, which may be drawn on to
assure payment of the 3 per cent, interest on the preferred
stock (No. 3) ; next, to pay the extra 1£ per cent, on the
deferred stock (No. 4); finally, one-third of whatever
amount is paid as dividend is to be used to buy and re-
deem deferred stock. This stock has been bought, so far,
at a small discount; £8991 in the past year bought £9590
(face value) of stock. During the past three years the
old debts have not been reduced except by these small
repurchases ; the bank’s history in that respect since 1900
has been as follows : ,

As the stock is cancelled, the premises account is written
down to the same extent; and for the past year another
£lO,OOO of the profits is used for the same purpose. The
practical effect of this is to build up an internal cash re-
serve, or to replace capital, etc., which has been lost
through the depreciation of assets. In either case, although
the figures disappear from the balance-sheet, the cash
position is none the less strengthened.
Other recent movements of this bank have been
like this :

Its own capital and reserves total £741,427, so it has the
use of a few pence over £9 of the public’s money for every
£1 of its own. That, of course, ought to mean big profits
for shareholders under favorable circumstances; 1 per
cent, earned as an average by that money would pay a
12£ per cent. div. on the bank’s capital. On the other
hand, a J per cent, movement in the average earnings of
this borrowed money will mean a difference of £16,791 in
the profits; wherefore violent fluctuations may reason-
ably be expected. Also the reserves and capital have to
safeguard unusually heavy investments ; the advances
alone are 6J times greater than the capital and reserves
combined—and all the liabilities are preferential so far as
capital is concerned. Taking the year’s profit at £61,784,
that shows £8 10s. 3d. per cent, on capital and reserves—a
very substantial figure. But for the reason mentioned
above the return is liable to be irregular, though pro-
bably the bank has done something in the good years to
equalise things in the poor ones that are bound to come.

For several years before the foregoing list opens the co.
had paid 15 per cent, dividend ; then, getting one taste
of the bad luck which comes to every fire insurance co.
sooner or later, it promptly dropped its dividend to 124
per cent., and kept it at that until it had added another
£53,187 to its reserves, or equal to more than half oj the
total capital. It has been the consistent policy of the co.
to build up strong reserves —very wise policy, too, seeing
that, with 10s. paid on the shares, there is an outstanding
liability of £9 10s. on them. The reserves have now
reached a point at which the whole of the 15 per cent,
dividend is paid out of interest earnings, leaving all the
underwriting profit to further swell the fund for the pro-
tection of policy-holders. Adding capital and reserves to-
gether we get £364,930 ; premiums last year were £113,171,
so there is £322 of capital and reserves for every £lOO of
premiums. This is a larger protection afforded to policy-
holders than almost any British office gives. The 55 tariff
and non-tariff fire-offices of Great Britain show capital
and reserves at the average rate of 151 per cent, of
premiums, or less than one-half of the provision made by
the National.
A further comparison of this co’s recent experi-
ences gives these results :

The co. does an extensive marine business; but the
figures for the two branches are not separated. No doubt
the uniformly high loss rate, coupled with a moderate
expense rate, is due largely to the marine branch. Also
that may account for the improvement in the year’s
profit; for, while there has been very little profit
in Australian fire business during the past 12 months,
marine business, though nothing out of the way,
has at any rate been better than it was in 1906-7, when
the experience of nearly all offices was wretched. The
weak point in the National’s balance is the large propor-
tion of the funds invested in mortgages ; the total is
£226,853, or £232,117 including accrued interest, etc.
Presumably the bulk of this is in Maoriland ; and, owing
to the possibility, if not the certainty, of a large slump in
values, which have been inflated by excessive borrowing,
mortgages there carry a large risk. No doubt they are
highly profitable while they keep their legs ; risky securi-
ties generally are. On the average of the co.’s invest-
ments, including debentures (£81,060) and deposits
(£40,400), the return last year was £4 13s. 9d. per cent.
If the co. can get through without losses on account of
the depreciation of securities, that is a very fine return
indeed ; but for the present one is bound to have a certain
amount of suspicion that some of that fine profit may
have to be written off by and bye.

This co. had a capital of £37,500 paid up by shareholders ;
but, as shown above, £62,500 has been transferred from
reserves, or undivided profits, so that the capital is now
£lOO,OOO. This makes the issued shares fully paid to £1 ;
so there is no further liability upon them. There are,
however, a further 150,000 shares authorised and avail-
able for future issue. While, therefore, the dividend paid
for the past three years has been 20J per cent, per annum
on the capital, including transfers from reserves, on the
actually paid £37,500 it amounts to 54| per cent, per
annum. This remarkable result was achieved by some-
thing striking in the way of self-denial a few years ago.
Moreover, the late W. L. Jack, the general manager, was
a man who very early saw the possibilities of big
profits in accident insurance, and he pushed that
branch of the business hard ; and in other ways also
the affairs of the co. were run with an energy
which amounted in some cases to daring. The capi-
tal of the co. had been very small ; consequently
the dividend absorbed no great amount. The shareholders
at that time took a large risk; and the policy-holders
evidently didn’t inquire very deeply into the matter,
or consider what their own risks were. Ten 3'ears ago,
for instance, the combined capital and reserves amounted
to £52,141 ; and the net premiums for that year (1898)
were £78,733. That is, there were only £66 of funds
(including reserve to cover unexpired premiums) for every
£lOO of annual premiums—a most dangerous proportion.
However, the co. had either remarkably good luck or
remarkably good management, and pulled through all
right. The co. took very big risks and it made very big
profits ; and, having added the bulk of the profits to the
reserves, it is in a very different position to-day. With
capital and reserves of £236,567, it had last year £156,769
of net premiums ; so the proportion of funds to premiums
is now 151 per cent.—not by any means the best showing
among Australasian cos., but still a great improvement
on the highly venturesome 66 per cent, of 10 years back.
The history of the Colonial Mutual is further

The premiums are not increasing like they did : there is
much keener competition now for accident business.
The year has also in general been one of unusually keen
competition for fire business, which probably accounts
for the rather higher expense rate —though, considering
what is understood to be the character of this co.’s busi-
ness (largely fire and accident), the expenses are unusu-
ally moderate. The assets are, on the whole, a commend-
able lot ; the co. has £165,000 in public securities and
fixed deposits, and, though this means a rather low
return, it puts the co. in a position to meet a sudden
calamitous demand without the sacrifice that is almost
inevitable where the securities are largely mortgages.

This old and energetic concern, whose shares are mostly
held in England, has had a long record of great pros-
perity and fat dividends—far longer and fatter than the
table on top of this suggests. Twenty years ago it was
paying 20 per cent., and it had done that for many years ;
but in the early ’nineties rabbits, drought, boomsters,
and other nuisances began to pare away the profits, and
dividends were steadily reduced, until for two years the
co. paid nothing at all. Then, in 1904, it got back to 2£
per cent., from which it has moved up to the present 12£
per cent. ; and the directors never meet the spoiled share-
holders these times without being asked why it isn’t
more. Some of those shareholders must be simply
gluttons; for even in 1904, after the worst had
been passed, the £3 shares were at £1 12s. 6d. ;
and that investment is giving a 23 per cent, return now
even with the 12£ per cent, dividend, which the holders
say isn’t enough. The capital is £520,000 ; and that isn’t
written-down capital either, for, though some of its re-
serves have had to go at times, the co. has had the rare
experience of coming through all the droughts without
having to touch capital. And that was all the more
astonishing because the co. has always had a very large
amount of borrowed money at risk, including £1,900,000
of 4 per cent, and £lOO,OOO of 3 per cent, debenture stock.
These two items have remained unaltered for some years.
Other liabilities, chiefly “ sundry creditors and customers’
balances,” total £403,371. On the other side :

In 1906 “advances and properties” were down to
£1,993,560 ; for Jumbuck had been having a magnificent
time between high prices for wool and mutton and good
clips, and his mortgage had been cut down by thick slices.
But things haven’t gone quite so well since then, and the
mortgage is getting back to something like its old size ;
also there is quite a crop of new mortgages, sown by men
who have gone into the Jimmy Tyson business
at the recent top of the market—which, by the
way, wasn’t exactly where Tyson started. The way
in which this co.’s figures jump up and down ought
to make some people think (though the thinking will
come a bit late for some of them). This co. has a big
commission business, quite apart from its squattages,
to help it through bad times; yet it shows a profit of
£61,586 in 1900, a loss of £78,963 in 1902, and a profit of
£157,490 in 1907. It is obviously a business which is
something extra in the way of a gamble ; for if the mort-
gagee’s accounts show these jumps, what will the mort-
gagor’s be like? And what are the prospects ahead of
the men who plunk into the business on the basis of the
values ruling in the £157,490 year?

The amount shown as written-off is exclusive of what is
charged direct to profit and loss to cover depreciation of
brewery plant, hotel furniture, etc. The total of this for
the past six months was £2226 ; for the previous six
months £2262. Nothing whatever is written off hotel
properties, which constitute by far the biggest item in
the balance-sheet. Only leaseholds, plant and furniture
are written down ; the other assets, w'hich are in at cost,
have moved this way:—

Brewery (land, buildings) £49,740 £74,392 £74,812
Hotel properties .. .. 49,045 176,293 176,883
So, in 6£ vears, £127,838 has been put into hotel proper-
ties. During that period £118,067 has been added to
reserves. Of this, £20,374 has been premiums on new
share issues, £1350 represents written-up values, and the
balance ( £96,343) has been undivided profit—a remarkable
record for 6J years’ work, and all the more remarkable
when it is remembered that the total paid capital is only
£101,450. The whole of the undivided profit and the
premiums have been put into hotel properties ; and the
profit which has been written off to cover depreciation of
plant has gone partly in the same direction, partly in
new plant. That is to say, more profit has been written
off to cover depreciation of plant than has gone into new
plant; so that whereas buildings, machinery, plant, etc.,
stood at £123,309 six and a half years ago, they stand now
at only £113,896, in spite of the purchase meantime of
freehold brew'erv property at a cost of £25,072. All the
time a dividend averaging nearly 30 per cent,
has been paid. Altogether it has been a phe-
nomenal record of profit-making; and so much of
the profit has been put aside that, even if the
reserves earned only 5 per cent., it would be enough to
pay a 9 per cent. div. on the capital, apart from whatever
the capital itself might earn. On the other hand there
are risks —there is the general brewery risk, due to the
growth and activity of the anti-liquor party ; and there
is the special Westralian risk of a heavy depreciation in
property values when the gold output slumps, as it is
bound to do before very many years. As to the former
risk, the anti-liquor party hasn’t made much progress yet
in Westralia ; but already there is a local option law fore-
shadowed by the Government, and that is a beginning,
and means a new expenditure on the part of the brewing
and hotel business for defence purposes.

The amounts shown in the foregoing as written off are the
total debits in profit and loss account. The item is, how-
ever, a composite affair —“ amounts written off for depre-
ciation, buildings, plant, bad and doubtful debts, etc.”
It isn’t satisfactory to lump sums marked off for depreci-
ation and bad debts into one item in this way. Ap-
parently, judging by an entry in the balance-sheet, the
item can be split up like this :
Bad Debts, etc. Depreciation. Total.
1904 .. £1572 £1153 £2725
1905 .. 1675 1612 3287
1906 .. 1034 789 1823
1907 .. 992 434 1426
1908 .. 939 254 1193
After that there is more lumping, and no guess even can
be made as to what the various parts of the next compo-
site item amount to—“ Stocks, wines, spirits, teas,
furniture, goodwill, rolling stock, etc.” Evidently part of
this —goodwill—is paper ; and to that extent the reserves
are nominal. It is not clear whether anything at all is
being written off goodwill ; in fact, not a great deal is
being written off anything. Stocks, etc., and breweries
and stores stand in the books at £44,257 ; so the aver-
age of the past three years’ provision for depreciation
(including rolling stock, it is to be observed) is only 1 per
cent. Certainly the co. may be adding to the rolling
stock, etc., and paying for it out of revenue, which would
have the same effect as writing the item down ; but there
is not the smallest indication of it. If in order to run
the concern the assets are worn out or depreciated at a
greater rate than 1 per cent, per annum, then some of the
dividend is being paid out of capital, and on a revaluation
at some time or other capital will probably have to be
written off. In July, 1904, the paid capital was £29,558,
in 36,061 shares, paid to various amounts. Subsequently
the Mareeba brewery in the north was picked up for a
trifle, and other purchases were made ; to help pay for
these things a further 5000 shares were issued, and the
paid capital is now £36,891. Other items :
1904. 1908.
Liabilities .. £5733 £16,841
Liquid assets (book debts, cash, etc.) 7135 10,778
Surplus in 1904 £1402
Deficiency in 1908 £6,063
The surplus in 1904, the extra capital, and the increased
amount of the public’s money in the business have gone
into larger stocks, more rolling stock, more premises, etc.;
and yet, as shown above, the amount written off for de-
preciation has become steadily less. There is a good deal
that is not satisfactory about the figures.

This business, established in 1883, was turned over to a
limited liability co. in 1902 ; but no sheets are available
for the earlier years—it is only in the last three years
that the public has come into the concern to any great
extent. Originally the goodwill item was £72,377 ; but
this is being steadily written off. That is to say, this
intangible paper asset is being replaced by money out of the
profits. By 1906 it had been worked down to £62,000, and
with the present appropriation it will amount to £55,000.
That is so far as the co.’s books show ; in the foregoing
table the item has not been reckoned as an asset at all.
On the face of it, very good progress indeed has been
made, seeing that, after writing leaseholds, etc., down as
shown above, the whole of the paper asset of £72,377 has
been wiped out except £10,158; in other words, in six
years the net profits have exceeded the dividends and the
amounts written off leaseholds, etc., by £62,219. The
capital is in 10,000 cumulative pref. shares (6 per cent.) of
£lO each and 150,000 £1 shares. The debts to the public
are considerable:—
1906. 1907. 1908.
Mortgages £40,800 £40,800 £38,000
Overdrafts, trade debts, etc... 65,262 82,745 109,501
Total £106,062 £123,545 £147,501
This means, of course, that there are two lots of cumula-
tive preference creditors to be satisfied before the ordinary
shareholders get a bite—(l) the cumulative pref. share-
holders and (2) the mortgagees and bank. While things
are prosperous, ordinary shareholders, who benefit by the
excess earnings on this borrowed and preference capital,
are on a good wicket; but in bad times the burden
falls on them. The assets are as follows :

There is no way at all of checking the bulky items here. Ob-
viously, almost everything depends upon the stock-taking
and the adequate provision for bad debts. The disclosed
profits can be made to appear too great or too little
according as the stock and the debts are over-valued or
under-valued ; and that is the crux of the whole matter.
In plant, etc., there is an entry “patent rights.” Though
patents are a wasting asset, there is no sign that any-
thing is written off. The item is, however, a small
one. Ten per cent, or thereabouts is apparently writ-
ten off furniture and fittings ; and leaseholds are
also well written down. Freeholds are not touched ;
it is probably claimed that they are increasing in value.
The accounts are very well presented, and though, of
course, nothing can be said regarding stock or book debts,
the balance-sheets leave a very favorable impression.

Realising that only the most modern form of
power can fill present day requirements, the Austral
Brick Co., which is starting extensive u ~rks at St. Peters,
Sydney, has placed an order with Gibson, Battle and Co
Ltd., 7 Bent Street, Sydney, and 128 William Street,
Melbourne, for a 200-h.p. Korting Suction Gas Engine.
This is the only gas engine in which an impulse is given
with every stroke as in the steam engine ; and in Europe
and America, where it is very largely used, it has won a
great name for its certain starting, close governing and
even turning, which are the main factors of success for
electrical and mill driving. Gibson, Battle will send

All philosophic works, and Holy Writ itself,
teem with warning of the uncertainty of'life. Deaths by
natural causes have been pushed far down the years of
civilised life, but with the increase of that very civilisa-
tion the liability to accident has enormously increased.
Ihe railway, the ferry, the tram, and the murderous
motor car inevitably cause thousands of people to place
their lives and limbs i,i the hands of entire strangers of
whose ability they can have absolutely no knowledge. It
would seem, therefore, to be only common-sense to guard
against the financial consequences of misadventure by
taking out an acciib nt and sickness policy with the South

After conducting exhaustive tests in the con-
cent ration of the ores at the Broken Hill South mine, the
manager, Mr. Wainwright, has finally decided to instal
the Wilflev type of table, modified in the direction best
adapted to his particular local requirements. The great
advantage with this type of table is that it admits of so
many slight variations which adapt it to meet all classes
of pulverised ores. Provided the pulp for treatment is
graded it can be used to treat all varieties of ore from
slimes up to coarse grades. When treating slimes and
lightly mineralised ores, care must be taken to have the
slope of the table accurate, and a fine, smooth dressing
surface beyond the feather edged diagonal termination of
the riffles. When treating coarsely ground ores or ores
heavily charged with mineral, as at the Broken Hill South,
the riffles or grooves can be carried further along the table
and in some instances right up to the concentrates dis-
charge end. Mr. Wainwright ordered six tables as an
experiment, with fewer riffles or grooves than customary,
and with some of them—the lower ones—carried to the
extreme end of the table. So successful has this type of
tVilfley table proved that he has ordered 50 more from
the Austral Otis Engineering Company. This same firm
has been placing several of the patent' Callow Screens at
Broken Hill and elsewhere. This ingenious and- simple
mechanism has solved the problem of grading prior to
concentration.* rg

few other co-operative concerns, is finding that
some shareholders loaf on it, keeping’ in debt to
the extent of their capital. The committee trounces these
loafers—“ It is of no assistance to the society to put in
share capital and then allow the accounts to run up to the
ai n?unt of the capital. The capital is used to buy goods ;
and if the amount owing by shareholders is equal to their
capital, then the capital ceases to be of any benefit to the
society.’’ So the society now says, “ Cash while you’re
at work.” Apparently the bonus is paid on cash and
booked business alike ; if it is, the system needs changing.
Ihe society’s rules provide that 5 per cent, of the net
profits shall go to the reserve fund ; obviously, however,
it is mere pretence to add 5 per cent, to the reserves and
then reduce them by 6 per cent, in order to pay the
bonus ; and that is what has been done in the past term —
e first one in the society’s history in which the
nn « n< * s focuses have exceeded the net profits.
Ihe financial position is, nevertheless, healthy. Debts of
all sorts amount to £3938, while liquid assets, before paying
dividend and bonus, amouted to £4534. This, of course,
is exclusive of stock, premises, etc. The capital (includ-
ing shareholders’ loans) totals only £5309 ; so that share-
holders draw in divs. and bonus at the rate of 49 per cent,
per annum on the amount of the capital they put into
the business. No wonder they want to extend co-opera-
tive marketing to other things!

This co. can do nothing with its sulphides except in a
stiong metal market; at even normal prices it can make
no profit out of them, and again and again it has had to
shut up shop. When the last boom broke, the market
lia.dn t got down far before Block 14 stopped the sulphide
mill ; for the sad truth is that the mine has so little
known sulphides left that it can’t afford to waste any of
them. No doubt there may be undiscovered ore bodies
in the mine ; but in prospecting in the lower levels the
co. lias drawn blanks nearly everywhere, and the re-
oon V n™ “ above the 600 ft. level” are set down at
220,000 tons, which amounts to about 24 years’
suPP‘y f° r the co.’s mill. However, while the sul-
phide null is shut down, the co. is poking about
among the pockets of rich carbonate ore that have been
hitherto overlooked, and the profits of the past two half-
years have come from this precarious source—except as
to £3412 received during the last six months on account
of zinc-bearing tailings. Fortunately during the lead
boom the co. hung on to most of its big profit, so on Sep-
tember 30 it had a surplus of over £55,000 in cash, de-
posits, etc. ; and this, with care, will see the co. through
until the lead market improves enough to allow the sul-
phide mill to start again. Twice previously the co. wasn’t
so well situated; the last time it almost had to buy
money it was driven to issue pref. shares in order to
raise capital ; it had to offer 10 per cent, as interest, and
on top of that these shares, paid to 65., draw exactly the
same dlividend (Is. per share, or whatever it may be) as
the ordinaries. And even then the whole issue wasn’t
subscribed by a long’ way. The co. isn’t likely to get into
that hole this time ; but the incident suggests that much
worse things are liable to happen to the metal markets
and Broken Hill shares than have happened lately.

„.£• D- Del prat, general manager of the Broken
Hill Prop., is a genial Dutchman, who smiles and smiles,
and is suspected of never even smiling withouta purpose.’
Probably he doesn’t deserve his reputation ; vet he has it
so when it was announced that the conference of Broken
Hill directors over the wages question had burst up in
Melbourne, the Broken Hill Prop, having withdrawn it
was at once concluded that there was some dark plot in
it all. The miners’ officers admitted they were
nonplussed, and were clearly a bit uneasy. The
most cheerful feature about the situation is that
at least two Broken Hill Prop, directors announce that
they don t aim at a reduction of wages, in spite of what
chairman Darling said a few weeks ago. The truth of
the whole business probably is that the Broken Hill Prop,
loves to be top dog—in fact, it loves to be the only dog
that counts. There was friction over that matter two
years ago when the present industrial agreement was
fixed up. At that, time boss-manager Delprat simply
took matters into his own hands, and carried the thing
through ; one or two of the other managements kicliecf,
but it was no good. A conference where one man counts
for as much as another isn’t therefore the sort
of place where the B. H. Prop, can feel comfortable. The
co. will probably try to fix up an agreement on its own
account; 8., M. and Co. will do ditto so far as the South
Blocks are concerned, and the Sulphide Corporation may
possibly join them (anyway, the Sulphide Corporation
would doubtless be prepared to make some sacrifices in
order to keep the wheels going); and the others, several
of them in a very much worse situation, will be left to
scramble through as best they can.

There isn’t the expected improvement in width
of lode at the bottom level of the Broken Hill South
Blocks, but still over a very serviceable Bft. 6in. the stuff
goes 164 per cent, lead, 340 z. silver, and 104 per cent,
zinc. It is good milling ore, as far as they have probed
it ; and they are wasting no time about that, having
already started drives both north and south.
* * * *
For a long time past Bewick, Moreing and Co.
have thrown approving glances towards the Junction
North, Broken Hill, where a compact and continuous ore
body offers splendid opportunities for economical man-
agement. Next to the South Blocks the Junction North
ore body should be the easiest on the field to work. It
was not for nothing that Messrs. Loring and Mitchell, of
8., M. and Co., made such an exhaustive examination of
the mine and mill at the Junction North, when last they
visited Broken Hill; and in spite of the fact that some
people connected with the co. don’t like the idea of 8.,
M. and Co. management, something may yet be done in
that way.
* * * *
The attempt to gauge the size and trend of the
lode accidentally discovered at theBooft. level of the British
Broken Hill mine by rising from the end of a crosscut put
into the ore body on the west side, has been a disappoint-
ment. After going up a little way on what was supposed
to be the footwall side, the rise got into mixed sandstone
and quartz, both very hard, and the streak of ore at last
petered out. When that part of the mine is properly
opened up, it will probably be found that this 800 ft. body
is another of those fish-shaped “ wallows” of ore which
have occurred in the upper levels of the main workings,
and which conform to no established rules as to direction
depth or continuity.

The Port Kembla works, owned by the new
Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Co. of Australasia,
will be in blast by the end of the year. The co. announces
that it will be ready to receive copper ores and mattes,
etc., during December. Those behind the concern have
evidently wasted no time in construction. The plant
comprises furnaces for smelting ores, converters for
blowing up matte to blister .copper, and a fine refinery,
which will extract electrolytically the gold and silver,
and at the same time produce electrolytic copper. The
works will also treat gold concentrates and all products
or material containing gold, silver and copper. Frank
Hambridge, who has for some years been Queensland re-
presentative of F. H. Snow, the Australian agent for the
principal copper-buyers of the world, will business-
manage the co.’s affairs in Sydney, where central offices
have been established in Bridge-street.

Last clean-up from Mount David (N.S. W.) was
an improvement. The mill return was 440 tons for
2384 oz. ! 350 tons of tailings cyanided for 590 z. ; and the
Huntingdon mill returned 25Joz. What tonnage is put
through the Huntingdon mill is never mentioned. The
total return was 3230 z., but as working costs are not
disclosed, shareholders are as much in the dark as ever.
Development work has been fairly successful at the 220 ft.
level, but there is nothing big enough to make up for the
drain on ore reserves.

A small Cobar show that may have a future is
the Oobar Gladstone ; 10 tons sent to the Great Cobar
went 37 per cent, copper. But until they get their
second shaft down, foul air will prevent them doing
much. They struck the ore at 186 ft.

Maryborough (Vic.) is hugging itself. The
district has got a mine on to the div. list. With the
Duke United shut down, and the Main Leads North
worked out, the end of the famous group of producers on
the Duke and the Main Leads seemed to have come. But
Duke and Main Leads Consols, working on the junction of
the two gutters, now swims out from the call-making
deeps to the land of sweet Profit. Having got there, the
sensuous air has taken the backbone out of the Board ;
so, instead of building up a reserve, bang goes the first
saxpence as a dividend. The sorry story- of the Duke
United and the depressing tale of the Burnt Creek might
. have warned directors that a few thousands safe in hand
smooth away troubles, especially when a patchy gutter
has to be handled.
* * * *
The lesson of the need of a reserve in alluvial
mining is smacked home by Chalk’s No. 3, Carisbroolt
(Vic.). The Government lent £5OOO, and the mine got on to
a patch of payable dirt. Debt was wiped out, and £2500
paid in divs. To day’s balance-sheet shows that the 00.
is already £1052 in debt. During the half-year 5879
fathoms returned 30570 z., or just enough to pay working
expenses and the last thou, of the Government loan. All
the good ground at No. 3 rise has gone. As to No. 4 rise,
the best that can be said is that the wash driven into so
far gives “ varied results.” At No. 5 rise prospects are a
bit better, but the dirt is as wet as a tropical shower.
Had the co. kept its £2500, put the under level 1000 ft.
ahead of the blocking- line, and got its wash drained, it
would have made profits even with the medium dirt
handled.

Catherine Reef, Bendigo, has decent-looking
stone on the west side of the lava in No. 3 winze north,
at 2200 ft. Some buyers slipped in for scrip, though the
situation is not sufficiently unrolled for anyone to go nap
on the shares. To get good gold on the lava may mean
that the more distant quartz won’t pay. This is what
happened when the big boom was on, so the weather eye
has to be kept on Bendigo.

Currie having got to England, the swell Board
of the Briseis (Tas.) sends out a pretty pink circular to
announce his advent. No one wants to hear again that
the Bingarooma race is a fine asset, or that the Board has
decided to wash down the overburden on the Bingarooma
lease, or that J. A. Wallace’s dredging- ground is being
tested. This is stale tripe. Shareholders long for a word
as to how the tests at Wallace’s are going, how much of
the overburden has been melted off at the Bingarooma,
and when drift will be attacked. Above all, they would
like to know what it cost to send Currie out to do what
Lindesay Clark could do as well, if not much better. But
these currants don’t appear in the cake, so it is tasteless
stuff to the Australian palate.
* * * *
With the market for Mount Lyell shares at
385., the co.’s scrip has a value of over £2,200,000. Profits
for the last half-year were, say, £156,000; this means that
the market sees seven years at that same rate in sight.
Out of this the investor has to get his money back, and
interest as well. This is with copper at £5B 12s. per
ton, and the superphosphate business thrown in. North
Lyell ore reserves are given at 710,000 tons. As 130,000
tons are used per annum, this means five years’ ore in
sight. On this basis, the share market has got ahead of
the mine. Certainly copper has been taken at a low price,
though it has gone much lower. What a saver North Lyell
has been to Bowes Kelly, Jamieson, Knox, and Joe Syme !
Level after level has added to reserves. Now at 1000 ft. the
co. can look overhead and reckon up 710,000 tons of 5} per
cent, material to mix up with its o'6o per cent. “ Blow ”
ore. In the North Lyell the ore is pretty well depleted
down to 500 ft., and a big slice has been cut out between
that and the 700 ft. level. The 850 ft. formations have
made into such size that Sticht says they have only just
been broached. This level is the pium in the pudding for
wealth and extent of ore. It is too soon to talk about the
1000 ft. level. Sticht does not let light into this dark
place, save over the new development ore bodv, which
promises well as to extent and quality. The least the
Board could do is to issue plans with the report, and to
state the reserves at the different levels. Without plans
the reports are a jumble, with their No. 12, No. 23, No. 64,
No. 81, No. 93 stopes and sub-stopes. With plans work
could be followed.

The proposed sale of the New Anniversary pro-
perty at Kerberton (Q.) to the Queensland Copper Co.
(Mt. Perry) is likely to come off. A new co. of 50,000
shares of £1 will be formed, of which 25,000 fully-paid
shares will be retained by the purchaser ; 10,000 are to
be underwritten by the Q. C. Co. as working capital. Of
the remaining 15,000 the New Anniversary syndicate gets
10,000, together with £1250 cash ; and the adjoining pro-
perties on the same line of lode are to be taken over for
5000 shares and_£l2so cash. The Mt. Perry Co., in this its
initial venture in North Queensland, has picked up a good
thing, unless appearances are shamefully deceptive.
Ravenswood (Q.) for October returned gold
worth £5617 from mills, £4026 from ore and concentrates
sold to metallurgical works, and £660 from cyanide and
alluvial. The big co., the New Bavenswood, Ltd., from
its various mines got £7083 ; the best individual producer
was the Sunset, with £5600. At this co.’s works the oil
system of concentration, which is very pretty in theory
is proving full of difficulties in practice, and is going to
be costly.

New Brilliant Freehold, Charters Towers, con-
tinues to stope the hanging wall reef, and expects to
keep 10 head of stamps going. Separate reefs are beiw
worked on each side of the Day Dawn formation, and in
both instances No. 6 level has proved excep-
tionally rich and better than other levels be-
yond Mills’ United boundary-. No. 6, on the foot-
wall side, belongs to the East Mexican, and is
skirting the boundary, and trending almost due east;
No. 6, on the hanging wall side of the formation, is in the
N.B. Freehold, and is said to be trending a little to the
north of east. In that case it will be bearing away from
the E. Mexican boundary, although not so rapidlv
as to spoil the E. Mexican’s chance, if the reef
extends far upwards. Taking the cost of driving on
No. 6 hanging-wall reef at about £5 a foot, and allowing
something for crushing and other expenses, a return of
£2680 from 110 ft. of driving pans out at an average profit
of about £lB per foot. This rich miners! stone may- be con-
sidered as a sweetener for a lot of poor ground. No. 7on
the footwall reef has split, and leaders have gone into the
hanging-wall, leaving about Ift. of stone on the footwall
side. No. 7is the longest level out from Mills’ United
boundary', and for quite a distance after passing the 400 ft
mark it has proved patchy and erratic.
* * * *
The Tyrconnel, on the Hodgkinson (N. Queens-
land), has enlivened that patchy locality by becoming
productive again. The new find is knowm as Keating’s
reef, after the man who stuck so long to the show and
has now discovered what looks like a fine big reef sft.
wide, outside the old workings. A paddock of 2oz. stone
has been raised. The Tyrconnel was a famous mine in
the early days, and the prospectors, Bedmond and
M Veigh, made a good rise out of it. Tyrconnel gold
helped M’Veigh into the House of Commons, where he
still sits—a Home Buler and a splendid type of patriotic
Irishman. The memory of another fine old North Queens-
land pioneer, “Paddy” MacFadden, clings round the
Tyrconnel; but “Paddy” passed in his number at St
Vincent’s Hospital a while back.

“X.P.D.”: For shareholders and intending
shareholders in Chillagoe (Q.) the one big question is—
u it good enou gh ? ” I have been there and there-
abouts for a couple of years, and have seen both what was
meant for me to see and what the big men don’t show to
visitors. The co.’s main want is a really decent mine to
draw supplies from. Lady Jane and Girofla are big only
in comparison with the pot-hole show* round Shout,
/.i 11 man toil, because of the rotten country it is in, re-
quires a most expensive style of timbering. Also when
they are not fighting a burst of water there (with the
miners knocked off and the boilers fairly eating firewood
while two big “Cousin Jack” pumps are struggling
with a subterranean lake), the shifts are pegging*
away on ore worth about 9 per cent. The stuff sent to
the smelter is certainly thicker than what goes through
1 ~ P u mps ; otherwise, the two substances are prettv
well identical—it has been said that there is more copper
in the creek than in the mine, though no serious attempt
to recover it by deposition has been made. At Ruddigore
(the co. s property, two miles out, not Torpy’s Chillagoe-
JKuddigore show) the ore is broken cheaply enough, but
two dilhculues that can’t be circumnavigated there are
the low percentages and the necessity for picking every
„ °A ore ‘ Also, the water for concentrating plant and
ail other purposes has to be pumped at Chillagoe and
earned along by pipe-line. To stand these extrataxesand
still pay usually requires a decent mine—and a quarry of
- P er cent, stuff mixed with road-metal is scarcely that.

“Phoenix”: In reply to “Gympie” (B. 6/11/’08),
a patriotic desire to advance the interests of a locality
one resides in is to be commended, but to attempt to
k°°m the place is another matter, and deserves attention,
that the thin surface seams and wedges of slate at the
two Mile and the underlying strata might at some re-
mote period have been connected with the more settled
country about the Phoenix is quite possible ; a commotion
must have occurred in the bowels of the earth to “heave ”
the country such a distance. This theory may account
tor the settled condition of the slate beds south
from Gyrnpie, and the continuity of the payable
reefs there, whilst the crumpled and jumbled-up
country, with its isolated patches of payable
quartz at the Two Mile, would indicate the severe
convulsion it suffered when the dislocation happened. I
have no desire to depreciate the value of the shares held
by those at present testing the deep ground at the Two
Mde. -Nor am I such an ass as to attempt to predict that
payable gold will not be discovered. But, after nearly
40 years experience by those who have, at different times,
unsuccessfully endeavored to find anything - payable at a
depth, the prospect, I hold, is not too bright. Many
shafts were sunk, from 100 ft. to 200 ft., in the old days.
The Chatsworth party got 500 oz. of pure gold in the red
clay, near the surface, and used nearly all of it in deep
sinking*. Many others, who got patches of gold near the
surface, did the same. The shareholders in No. 1 North i
Phrenix, all practical men, with plenty of money at their
back, essayed the task, and sank a shaft 450 ft., and then
had to abandon the undertaking - . However, let us hope
that patience and perseverance will reward the efforts of
those now working there.
* * * #
Sandstone Development (W.A.) shows a profit
of £666 on working account for the half-year to the end
of July ; but £2480 written off to cover depreciation puts
the balance £lBl4 on the other side. Development (main
shaft, etc.) is not charged to working expenses ; but £1986
of the cost is included in the present allowance for de-
preciation. Development now stands as an asset for
£10,741, which amount will have to be written off out of
future revenue. On July 31 the co. owed £2999 plus
£4OO due to vendors; but in Sept, a fine crushing was
put through, and at the end of that month the liabilities
exceeded the cash balance by only £2OO, and there were
300 tons of ounce stone ready for treatment. The co. is
now crosscutting - for the reef from the Juno No. 1 shaft,
further back from the Oroya-Black Range boundary ; and
that work will go a long way towards showing whether it
is a big permanent mine or not. In any case, however,
there is enough stone showing and assured to justify
the erection of a 10-head mill; and the funds for that
and other plant will be provided by the issue of 33,020
shares in reserve. It was proposed to put these off in
London ; but the directors prefer an Australian issue,
which, it is understood, will be announced very shortly.
* * * *
More glowing references to the Augusta, at
Laverton (W.A.), are now being made by the papers over
that side. Years ago an English co. worked this pro-
perty, but, as gold got scarce in depth, J. Bull packed up
his traps and left. Later on a local syndicate of 14 came
along, and since then £52,000 has been taken out of the
mine and £18,200 distributed in dividends. Now, on top
of a report that 26ft. of 23dwt. ore has been exposed in
the bottom workings at 400 ft., conies the news that the
owners have formed a co., and are anxious to sell the
public some shares. It is wonderful how anxious some
unselfish people are to let the public in as soon as ever
they strike a gold mine.
* * * ir
There was a good deal of discussion at the Gwalia
Consolidated meeting - when the question of issuing the
new shares came on for argument. Finally it was decided
that they should be first offered to shareholders at 3s. 3d.,
and, as it was announced that the whole issue had been
guaranteed by Lionel Robinson and party, free of com-
mission and brokerage, there was quite a rush to get in.
A Perth paper takes umbrage at. the stand-
offishness of the Menzies Consolidated management, and
w'arits to know why it is not more communicative. This
co. has been producing gold on and off for the past 10 or
12 years, but it has never paid a dividend and probablv
never will. No information beyond the bald monthly
return is given out in Australia, and very little is
obtainable from the annual report. The directors and
officials seem to live well, but, as no crumbs fall from
their table, shareholders have a hungry look.

“Melilla” : The sooner a Royal, Republican,
or other sort of commission is appointed to inquire into
the administration of the Mining Act in North Queens-
land the better the prospectors and miners will be pleased.
It seems some people can hold leases for years without
paying up the rent ; but payment is quicklv made when
some prospecting party clears off the kangaroos and
opens up the long silent show. Then their reward is a
notice to quit. Grim stories are told of a certain wolfram
mine which was years in arrears of rent, and aban-
doned to all appearance. Some miners decided to
give it a try, and made application for a lease. But
another person had a lease of it, which, they believe,
should have been cancelled years back for non-payment
of rent (leave alone non-working). He evidently got infor-
mation, paid up the arrears, and the miners were ordered
off. Still another case occurred in a tin show, which was
in arrears too, until some poor devil of a tributor got
good tin in it. Then the arrears were quietly paid.
There’s something rotten in the state of things. One
party in particular holds leases by the dozen, and only a
trifling percentage are ever worked, while rents appear
to be paid anyhow.

“ Myrtle ” : Some Bulletin writers have
been talking of the points of the prickly pear.
It has another. On many struggling selections,
the careful wife, anxious to keep the month’s exes
inside what she gets for the butter, makes prickly
pear jam (mixed with melon or lemon it is
delicious); also she produces jelly and pies, and
finally uses pear juice as a coloring instead of
cochineal. An old drover I know uses a medicine
made from the leaf of the cactus as a cold cure,
and it’s good, too. By-the-bye, what’s wrong
with utilising the pear as a nursery for the
cochineal insect? Or has the chemist knocked
cochineal out ?
“ Edyson ” tells a tale of sin and sausages:
It was late. I was hurrying from the theatre. Mel-
bourne was thronged with spring visitors. He was a few
yards in front of me. He was canted sharply to the right
from the hips up, and had a forward lurch. Under his
left arm, hugged tight, was a newspaper parcel, from
which trickled' three fat, pale sausages. Crossing
Collins-street his cargo shifted, and he made a little
drunken run to catch up his equilibrium. I was just in
time to snatch him from under the wheel of a hansom
cab. He fell back on me, embracing me with one arm,
and flattening a pale sausage against my new mauve vest,
the pride of my life. “Brave f’l’r!” he said. “Shaved
my life?” He felt solemnly for my hand, and shook it
for perhaps a minute. “Shaved my life,” he said. I
pointed him on his way, and he lurched again, and did
another little run. Now there were four blonde sausages
dribbling from his parcel.
Presently he pulled up, turned sharply, and dived at
me. He hit me in the middle region with his head, and
bis free arm embraced me again. “ Shaved my life !” he
said. “ Gorblesher ! ” People surveyed the scene with
emotion. I struggled to preserve my natural coolness. I
felt that my aplomb was deserting me and mv insouciance
was becoming frayed at the edges. I assured him it was
all right, poised him carefully, and fled.
Thirty yards further on somebody clasped me from
behind. A boa of pale sausages fell about my neck. A
thick voice said : “Shaved my life ! Gorblesher! Gor-
blesher ! Shaved my life ! ” The drunk ciung to me.
He said I was his preserver. “ Come home with me,” he
said. “Introdusber my wife. Shaved my life. Intro-
dusher my wife. My wife never forget yeh.” He backed
me against a shop-front. The crowd gathered. Three
little boys began to yell. “ Goo'woman, my wife,” said
the drunk, “ but ’er mothersh a beasht. Worry o’ my
life.” He began to cry, and I leaned him on a window,
threw off the hateful tentacles of sausage, and fled again,
blasted with the laughter of the vulgar.
I reached the station gates. Deliverance was at hand.
A stout woman blocked me, and he came again. He was
dragging a line of trodden and disreputable sausages.
He had lost his hat. He clutched me. “ Shaved my
life!” he said. He turned to his delighted following,
holding me up to public admiration as a hero. “Shaved
my life ! ” he said. “ Gorbleshim ! I was shust goin’
down third ’n’lasht time, ’n’ he plunged in ’n’ shaved my
life.” I tried to break away, but he held on. He started
crying again. He cried quite pitifully. “ Shaved my
life ! ” he said. He raised his voice, and blubbered it
aloud : “ Shaved my life ! ” The crowd cheered. “ But
I’m gra’ful,” whimpered the drunk. “ Nob’dy can say
I ain’t gra’ful t’man shaved my life. Here!” He thrust
his battered and abominable bunch of sausages upon me,
“There!” He stepped back with a grand gesture.
“Thash for shavin’ my life.”
I dashed the sausages on the ground, fled through the
gate aiid escaped, with the cheers of the multitude ring-
ing in my ears.

“Fitzwilliam ” : Is there anything in the
theory that a shark will not touch a blackfellow ?
I have often heard the question discussed, but the
discussion net er settled anything. I remember
one time, in North Queensland, we had been fish-
ing, and found the kellick fouled, as kellieks
sometimes are, and the owner sent a blackfellow
down to release it. I was interested because the
place was swarming with sharks, and I had never
seen a blackfellow eaten. But he came up all
right, and it was explained to me then that he
was in no danger, because sharks don’t like the
flavor, or the smell, or something. I don’t think
there is much in either of these explanations,
because the shark wouldn’t know what the flavor
was until he had tried, and it is fatal to a black-
fellow to be tasted by a shark. And you can’t
smell anything under water, even a blackfellow.
But I must say that I have never heard of a black-
fellow being taken by a shark. While on this
subject. I saw one time a Chinaman crossing a
river, wading up to his waist, when suddenly he
was pulled down by a crocodile. lam satisfied
that the croc, ate him, because he (the croc.) was
shot near the same place a day or two afterwards,
and there were partially digested fragments of
Chinaman in his interior. But this case does not
throw much light on the question as to whether a
shark will eat a blackfellow. I would suggest that
when Dr. Arthur’s Commission goes to the
Northern Territory, it should try the following
experiments: Throw (a) a blackfellow, (b) a
Chinaman, into (1) shark-infested water, (2) croc-
infested water, and note the results. The experi-
ments should, of course, be repeated a sufficient
number of times to eliminate any possible chance
of error, and to make sure of arriving at a fair
average. For instance, with 50 Chinamen and 50
sharks you would get definite results or evidence
such as you could never obtain from one Chinaman
and one shark.
A man who uses a scrap of Latin for a pen-
name writes from Colombo, in Ceylon’s spicy isle :
Have just come from nor’-west Westralia. Had about
12 months there, but have been on the more southern
goldfields for the best part of 15 years. Noticed in your
paper a letter glorifying the IS or’-West. Such letters
do much harm. Compared with other fields, the
Nor’-West is no good for gold. Everything is in
“ squibs.” I guarantee that not three men ever yet made
£lO,OOO out of any claim in the Nor’-West in all the 20
years since its discovery. People overlook the fact that
in every new country where certain rocks are exposed a
variety of minerals is pretty certain to be scattered around
on the surface. If no good permanent veins follow, the
country gradually dies out as a mineral country, and this
is what the Nor’-West is doing. Most of it is dying a
natural death, from a mineral point of view, and it would
have died sooner had its distance away not lent it a value
that it never possessed. Witness parts of Tasmania,
Maoriland, and other countries, where infinitely richer
things were found than in the Nor’-West. It never at
any time could be called rich. Talk about the Klondyke
and Station Peak! What were they ? Gross amount of
gold out of one about £40,000, and the other £50,000.
Gregory and Montgomery (State mining engineer) went up
there last year. At Moolyella, certain persons had a lot of
wages men on temporarily working a large, barren tract
of ground for the purpose of giving an appearance of
prosperity to the place. Montgomery made the absurd
statement (it appeared in print) that because some 70,000
tons of ore had been got at Pilbarra, worth 2oz. to 30z.,
there would almost certainly be a vastly larger quantity
of low-grade ore. His previous experience in Tasmania
and Maoriland should have taught him otherwise. More
gold came out of the Shotover and Caledonian in twelve
months than the whole Nor’-West yielded in 20 years ; and
yet where are the bodies of low-grade ore there or around
the Lefroy in Tasmania? The reckless statements of
Gregory and Montgomery lured many there to their bitter
experience. The victims are too worn out or broken
down, if they ever succeed in getting away, to publish
their experiences and let a little truth out. The country
is run for the storekeepers. If a tin miner employs a gin to
“ yandy ” some tin for him, he is run in at once and fined
heavily ; but the storekeepers employ gins regularly and
the police never interfere. Certain storekeepers also
regularly supply blacks with liquor for skins, etc., and do
it with impunity, but when an ordinary man does so
retribution is sure and swift. Most of the working men
are enslaved to the storekeepers, who charge them ex-
orbitant rates for everything. With certain minor excep-
tions, my opinion of the Nor’-West generally from a
mining point of view is that it is a stupendous fraud.
IMPOSSIBLE
PORTER: "Tuin's gone, sir!"
BILL BLUEGUM: "Bu-bu-but it can't-I've got me ticket!"
“Pick”: “There’s the spot, boys,” said
Dan the Teamster, after his seventeenth drink,
pointing with his pipestem towards where stood
the ruins of the old Travellers’ Rest. “That’s
where the Clarkes shot old Moloney, the shanty-
keeper, and in those days whips of fellers got into
their last bog down there with the delirious trim-
mings. Old Moloney’s ghost hunts about there
yet, looking for the bottle of yellow boys he had
planted when the Clarkes got to him, though he
hasn’t got a tombstone to jingle his brass on if he
found it; and I’ll bet you a gallon of beer that at
this moment the others are a-wrangling and hust-
ling there over the old whisky bottles, though not
a one of ’em has a stomach left to hold whisky in.
I don’t brag, but I do say I’m the only feller on
the line that ever faced that rum lot of bone-
shakers when they were out on the razzle ; and a
feller wants some nerve among a crowd of ghosts
holding of a temperance meeting, let alone when
they’re keeping up the other end of the liquor traffic
platform. Last winter some of my mates and me
were just a-going to camp there one snowy night,
when out of that’ere old shanty comes sailing a
dozen or two of them skeletons, and blow me if
ahead of them wasn’t Moloney himself a-riding on
my old poler Rattler wot starved himself there on
the old whisky corks eight years ago last wool
season—this ’ere whip’s made of his hide. Well,
my mates bolted, screaming like mad black gins
with old Nick after them, but I just laughed till
my ribs cracked to see Moloney a-bashing into
that there old Rattler wot always was a lazy,
crawling old cow. Hey? What? I saw Mrs.
Donnelly’s geese a-coming out of there? Geese
be hanged! Well, good-night chaps.”

“ Won Hi” : I write in support of “Itan’s”
recent plea for the proper classification of our
native fauna. Was traversing the country
with a friend on a recent Sabbath after-
noon, when we encountered some sft. 9in.
of indigenous fauna slumbering on a flat
rock. We slew the sleeping creature, and
dragged it in soiiie triumph to Benalla
(Vic.), where we abide. The Benallese
abo.-ites diagnosed deceased variously, as
“black,” “brown,” “ carpet,” and “blanky
tiger.” One expert, on being led into the
presence of the corpse, quaked violently,
heaved a flask of snake-j uice, which he was
carrying, through an adjacent window, and
classified our victim as an “Oh —’ell!”
Mrs. Murphy, a prominent local landlady,
on having the unknown cadaver placed
at her feet, called it “My Gawd!” and
prostrated herself in a deadly swoon on top
of it. Don’t know much about these
things personally, but have stated the
above facts to show that the chaos “ Itan ”
depicts is not only real but dangerous.
Maoriland is digging up its dead and
ferocious past at considerable speed these days,
and things which had much better have been
buried in oblivion are being dragged to light in a
burst of swelled head. The latest of these relics
is the armor of Hongi, the most bloodstained
character in Maoriland history, and a chief whose
shade occupies a front seat Below —or ought to.
This ancient ruffian made a trip to England,
where King George IV. presented him with a suit
of armor. When the ruffian returned to Maori-
land he armed his men with muskets, and swept
through the North Island, killing and eating men,
women and children. Fortunately his armor was
heavy and hampered his movements, so he mostly
went into battle without it, and one afternoon he
stopped something which ended his career 48
hours later. After his death the scaly mail dis-
appeared, but Dr. Pomare recently interested
himself in the recovery of it and traced it to a
pah opposite Jerusalem, on the Wanganui River.
It was known to be buried somewhere about the
old pah, but the quick growth of ti-tree had
obliterated all landmarks, and it was only after
considerable digging that the doctor managed to
locate the trophy. It was of steel inlaid with
brass, and made to cover the back and the chest,
and there were gauntlets for the hands. Hongi’s
legs appear to have been left quite defenceless.
The helmet is said to have been buried in a separ-
ate place, and Dr. Pomare is now in hot pursuit
of that curio also.
“ Eggspurt ” : I am fain to agree with
“C.K.Y.” (B. 15/10/’08) as to the banality of hen-
ranching. Being smitten recently with the
insane idea of increasing the henfruit output for
purposes of profit, I set 14 eggs at 7s. 6d. the
batch. The result was nine roosters and one
pullet that swiftly died. Another setting at 7s.
6d. eventuated. The hen in charge went off duty
the day the eggs arrived. So I walked over and
borrowed an allegedly broody bird from a neigh-
bor eight miles off. The bird for some obscure
cause refused to brood. I rang up her owner and
complained. He said, “ Swing her round till she
is giddy, then tuck her head under her wing, and she
will brood to distraction.” I obeyed him. Result:
The hen became dizzy and reeled —so much so that
she broke six of the 14 eggs at her disposal. Also
she refused absolutely to brood. Instead she leant
against the side of her box looking angry. I rang
up another fowl-minded person. He said, “Give
her two teaspoons of whisky, and she will brood
with enthusiasm.” I gave the hen two teaspoon-
fuls of 30 0.p., and at first thought she had thrown
the seven. When she rallied somewhat, she broke
four more eggs. She also declined heatedly to
brood under any circumstances whatever. I con-
sulted “The Expert” of my native village. He
said, “Shut her in a dark box where she can’t see
any daylight at all, and she will brood a hurri-
cane.” I did so. Later on, I removed a board.
She was sitting. Twice more I looked and found
things satisfactory. A day or two after, I looked
more closely. The hen was couched on a gol-
gotha of egg-shells. She had eaten the balance of
the setting. At that very moment the house-
keeper came in to say a snake had bit the yaller
hen and she had just slung her hook, leaving four
hens to carry on the stud. I swore 14 times—•
once for each ruined egg—and retired from fowl
cultivating for life.

A man without humanity is a woman.— Sadi.
The existence of the Lady, that monster of European

“ Kill not, for Pity’s sake, lest ye be slaying
The meanest thing, its upward flight essaying ” ;
So pled the Buddha, and our Bible still
Commands decisively “ Thou shalt not kill !”
And though our race, from its first cradles straying,
Must slay to live, in this way' disobeying
The mandate’s strict interpretation, yet
There might be limits to destruction’s net.
For man kills, too, that woman may look pleasant
And boast “ My new hat, with its golden pheasant
Nestling in ruching in the cutest way,
Was much the smartest one in Church to-day.”
And woman’s attitude is most unsparing
When she goes forth a-spoiling for her wearing.
“ Man is the most ferocious thing with life,”

“ What can we do, my dearest ? ” Hear her purring
To some companion cat, cognate, concurring !

But they must suffer for our beauty’s sake.
To let them live their span would be delightful,
But one’s appearance would be simply frightful
Garnished no longer with the tails and wings,
Coats, heads or bodies of the dear dead things.”
And so, for her, or through her lavish buying,
Bright-plumaged birds, sweet songsters, are a-dying ;
The beaver bleeds, the callous clubbers peel
Its pelt from the still-palpitating seal!
For her the pale, consumptive sempstress, stooping,
Slaves for a starveling’s pittance, daily drooping ;
And strong men wither in the sordid quest
For drossy ornaments, at her behest.
Yet, when we see her—fair, resplendent, thrilling,
All furs and feathers, with rare perfumes filling
The air she agitates—we quite forget
The blood and brimstone, drudgery and sweat,
The terror and the agony and wailing
Attendant on this vivid vision sailing,
So sweetly, so serenely satisfied,
And looking fitted for a monarch’s bride.

“ The Bushranger ” : Struck rather acute
idea in a backblocks pub kitchen the other day. It
was the property of the hired food-ruiner —and a
fine, upstanding, healthy specimen of Australian
girl she was. In place of the ordinary print dress
affected by her kind this damsel wore a white
mantle, or overall, made in one piece. It had big
flapped pockets all over it. On the flaps were
printed in large black letters such words as “Salt,”
“Pepper,” “Curry,” “Flour,” “Sugar,”
“Spice,” “Soda,” “ Ginger,” etc. When the
compartments were full she had the appearance
of a camel, or packhorse, about to start on an ex-
ploring expedition. As a time-saver her device
was an easy winner. She hadn’t to move a yard
from the stove for her ingredients. This scheme
of a professional or trade uniform deserves to be-
come popular. The editor of Melbourne Life,
for example, or of one of the weekly offshoots of
our great and informative dailies, would find a
gabardine smock, with pockets labelled “ Paste,”
“Imported Matter,” “ Scissors,” “Challenges,”
“ Bonuses for persons obtaining new subscribers,”
very handy, and he would look well in it too. I,
myself, am thinking of attaching a bag to my
dungarees labelled “ Revenue derived from litera-
ture.”
BRANDING MICKIES.
STINGY SMITH: "Look sharp, Billy, with that
brand. I ain’t going to stand here all the
morning.”
“ John Patrick ” : A vegetable whose
principles are strictly anti-vegetarian grows in
profusion about the Bluff (M.L.). It displays
long, tempting-looking leaves before the eyes of
wearied flies. When the fly sits down on one of
these it immediately becomes a fixture by reason
of a glutinous substance thereon. After a while
the leaf rolls itself up, discharges upon its captive
a secretion resembling animal saliva, and in a
very short time the fly is assimilated. The leaf
then unrolls to await another victim, and all that
remains of the unfortunate flv is its wings. This
plant can be fed with pieces of beef or mutton,
both of which it will accept eagerly; but it refuses
to be tempted by any hard substance such as a
piece of wood or a stone. Another strange plant
fairly common in some parts of Maoriland has
small holes round its root, into which insects creep
for shelter. Each of these holes is a trap, by
means of which the hungry treelet catches its
victim, asphyxiates, and then slowly digests him.
DUE ENCOURAGEMENT.
POMPOUS (to Fatter, who has given a penny to the pavement artist): "I never give money to
these loafers.”
FATTER: “ You’re wrong, John, you’re wrong. I believe in encouraging art.”
“ Meisje ” (from Port Darwin) : The abo-
riginal may own a declining birth-rate, but the
already born section of him takes some declining.
The other day seven of the breed, male and
female, ranging between six and 60 years of age,
together with the usual cloud of dogs, started to
cross the harbor here in an old dinghy. A squall
happened along and upset them. It was dusk.
They couldn’t right their crazy vessel. The tide
had just started to ebb (which it does in a hurry
hereabouts, there being about a 22ft. rise and
fall), so they could do nothing but hang on and let
themselves drift to sea as cheerily as might be.
Next morning, the incoming tide hrought them
back to the harbor, and near enough to land for
them to swim for it. They arrived, dogs and all,
none the worse for their night’s outing. Their
main worry was that they had to abandon the
boat, which was worth at least ninepence.
One divorce case at this month’s Mel-
bourne sittings was notable because the petition-
ing husband asked for £IOOO damages from the
co-re. and was given £9OO. He and his wife had
dwelt together placidly for 24 years, when, during
his temporary absence in ’Frisco, she calmly took
her six daughters and went and kept house for
the co-re. Possibly the damages wouldn’t have
been so weighty had the sinful pair appeared
and explained things from their point of
view ; but the only evidence the jury
had that the tertium quid took
any live interest in the epi-
sode was the production of a
letter in which he assured
the hubby that he (the quid)
“ would treat and keep the
wife better than ever he
(the husband) had done,”
which was a sort of unneces-
sary “I’ve got her and be
hanged to you !” remark which
doesn’t seem to have gained him
much friendship in the jury box.-
Whatever the subsequent years may
yield, the first year’s maintenance of
the lady will be a costly matter anyhow.
The lady’s name, by the way. is Nettle. It is
alleged that when the Nettle is grasped boldly
it doesn’t sting ; but it appears that its husband
stings like Old Boots.
“ Myrtle” : Recently, at Clifton (S.Q.), a
religious maniac ran amok in a harmless way in
the bush. His chief crime was talking wildly to
himself and to a few jackasses and a leatherhead
or two. The constable coaxed him to the town-
ship’s cells by singing hymns, in which the lunatic
joined. The picture of a stout cop leading the
way singing, “ There is a happy land,” followed
by a blaring idiot, is worthy of a picture. The
only sad thing is that the elusive “happy land”
was the woodheap at the lockup.
“G.S.K.”: Be native names, it is note-
worthy that the aboriginal generally selected
some title suggestive of the peculiarities of the
christened neighborhood. For instance, “Poola-
maeca” (which is a creek West o’ Darling) means
“ Mother of Trees.” This particular creek has
extra large gum trees growing in its bed. Take
again the words “ Stockinbingal ” and “ Gundi-
bingal.” The second part of the words, “bingal”
signifies “belly,” whilst “Stockin’’ denotes
“plenty possum,” and “Gundi” signifies “no
possum.” Black brudder here denotes that at the
former there are (or were) “plenty possum for
belly,” whilst the latter conveyed the idea that
“ no possum for belly ” was the state of affairs.
“C.K.Y.” : Be the request addressed to
me through The Bulletin Correspondence
Column to cite authorities for my statement that
fowl-fostering does not pay on its own, herewith
a few. (1) Bradshaw, the expert of N.S.W. Agri-
cultural Department. Those interested may tap
his information well in this regard per post or
telephone. (2) The results of the recent Hawkes-
bury College laying competitions. Practical
writers discussed these competitions recently in
the Farmer and Settler (Sydney), and decided
against the hen as anything but a by-product. (3)
Any prominent storekeeper of the Riverstone
district where I abide, and where poultry farms
exist in hundreds. (4) Myself, who have kept
chooks for 20 years, and send 40 dozen eggs to
Sydney weekly. I don’t know of a single case,
when the food is bought in the usual way and eggs
and birds sold for table, where returns wouid be
called a profitable business. Asa general thing,
the hen that has to carry a rent charge and the
household expenses of a family on her own
proves a bird of ill-omen with a beak that points
ever towards the top-end of King-street.
A QUALIFIED ENGINEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Shire of Maldon (Vic.) recently offered £325 a
year for a qualified engineer willing to undertake thirteen
positions and find his own assistant.
When he isn’t engineering, and has finished all his plans,
When he’s totted up the votes,
And exterminated goats,
He can make a brief inspection of the sanitary pans,
Taking very careful notes,
Very, very careful notes ;
When the slaughter-yard he’s visited and registered the
kine,
When he’s fixed a careful eye upon the habits of the
swine,
He can make the valuations, get the rent-book writ ten
too— ,
For down in sunny Maldon there are lots of work to do —
Lots of work to do !
Lots of work to do !
• There —are —lots—of—work —to —do !
When he’s stamped the weights and measures and the
thistles have heen cut
(For this gay official needs
To attend to noxious weeds) ;
When he’s seen a name and collar put on Farmer
Sorg'hu m’s slut,
Whilst upon his calves it feeds —
Very furiously feeds—
He can answer correspondence and by searching make
quite sure
He’s performed the simple duties of his cosy sinecure.
Oh ! the pleasurable duties he’s performing for the State,
They’re too numerous to mention or to recapitulate
Recapitulate !
Recapitulate !
Or—to—re—cap— it—u—late !
Oh ! the councillors of Maldon, if it’s ever up to them —
Which it will (for who remains
With his subsidies and drains?) —
To qualify as councillors of New Jerusalem,
With gold halos, harps and trains—
Bewitching harps and trains,
As they go to pass the wicket where St. Peter has the key,
He will ask them very sternly, “ What municipality?”
And when they answer “ Maldon,” he will tell them
coldly, “No!
You were sweaters down in Maldon ; you can go and
sweat below !
Go and sweat below !
Go and sweat below !
You—can—go—and—sweat—below ! ”

W.H.T.
IN THE TALL TIMBER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Good sounds—of scented, clashing chips that in the
silence fall,
Of depths where unseen water slips, of birds that chase
and call;
The cheerful noise of chiming- steel, of crosscuts tearing
through
Red hearts of dumb bush-gods that kneel beneath the
heartless blue ;
High leaves that stir in the summer breeze in a drowsy
monotone—
These are the sounds of men and trees, of plain things
seen and known.
But, when, across the thundering deeps of timber conies
the wind,
A A'oice that wakes the road-lust leaps uproarious
behind !
The splendid, sighing chords that come from creek and
crashing tree ;
The noise of things that drone and hum and murmur
melody
And chatter in the broken lights among the moving
green—
Broad beams that warm white boughs and heights of pil-
lared whiteness seen
Through tangled screens of leafage—all these sounds of
summer days
Are naught when sunset breezes call from distant, dusty
ways.
Then, at bush-altars virginal, the angry prayer o’ me :
“ Give me a road and a horse and a pal whatever the luck
may be ! ”
Give me a horse and let me go, with good dog Cash at
heel,
To see the world wag, and to know red life once more
and feel . ’
The forest’s grim, mysterious spell swept off my troubled
soul;
To go once more where I can smell salt sprav, where
breakers roll ;
To see bush homes, and paddocks where the sun-burned
stookers stride
Behind the harvester ; to share the luck where life is
wide—
Give me a horse and a tucker-stake, whatever the luck
may be—
A horse and an old-time pal to take the road again with
me !
vie.

The following piece of scientific informa-
tion, from a recent number of London Health,
should be of considerable use to some of the
swaggies and hatters and backblokes who wend
their weary way in the wilds of the West :
A simple method of testing suspected water is to place
five ounces in a perfectly' clean ground glass-stoppered
bottle, and add ten grains of pure granulated white
sugar. This should be set in a well-lighted window, but
not exposed to the direct rays of the sun, the tempera-
ture being kept as near 70° F. as possible. Organic matter
is detected within 48 hours by the appearance on the
surface of many white specks, these varying in number
according to the amount of organic matter. An odor of
rancid butter appears within a week or ten days if the
water be very impure. Such water should not be used
for drinking purposes.
If “Jimmie Pannikin” and “Dandalup” and
Mr. Sorenson and the rest drink bad water after
that, their blood will be on their own summit.

The cough that is contracted in the winter,
and which continues through the spring and sum-
mer, nearly always indicates some throat or lung
trouble, and should not be neglected. The ordi-
nary cough medicine may soothe the throat, but it
has not the power to heal. Recovery is not com-
plete, and a second attack is more liable to follow.
You cannot get a better medicine for coughs of this
description than Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is an excellent
medicine for all throat and lung trouble, for it not
only soothes the irritation, but it heals the affected
parts, and leaves them in such a healthy con-
dition that the danger of a second attack is
removed.*

Fwedewick Augustus Cooper, who died, a
very old man, in Melbourne lately, was a magnifi-
cent member of the Queensland Assembly for a
spell, and would have stuck there but for an acci-
dent —the 200 and odd votes recorded for him at
California Gully proved to be nearly all given by
very dead voters, and the 18 votes which the Elec-
tions and Qualifications Committee finally allowed
were not enough to put him ahead of Tom Camp-
bell. In the way of “ stuffed ” ballot boxes, that
California Gully experience was probably an Aus-
tralian record.

Apropos Tom Kite and the Dun Cow pub (B. 19/11/’O3).
It was in 1833 (not ’88) that a list of old colonists was pub-
lished with their estimated wealth, and in it Mr. Kite
was set down at £25,000. Mr. Kite went over the Moun-
tains about the same time as Mr. William Lee—in the
’twenties. When Tom Kite retired from the Dun Cow,
he purchased Dockairne, originally the property of A.
Kenneth Mackenzie, at what is now called Raglan ; also
he bought Woolstone, at Kelso. A daughter married
George Lee, M.L.C., of Leeholme, and but recently died.
Anotl?ar daughter married Mr. Richard Cousins, an old
colonist, who died in Bathurst about 20 years ago ; he was
one of the founders of the Bathurst Hospital. William
Kite, Tom’s second son, was born at Bathurst in 1836. He
formed a station on the Bogan in 1860, and in later years,
at Kelso, he was a noted breeder of Clydesdale and blood
horses. On one of his visits to England he purchased
some of the best mares and stallions procurable. An
open-handed, generous man was William Kite, and to his
love of sport and open-handedness and, perhaps, the
entail, may be attributed his limited means at death. It
would seem as if the fourth generation released the tied-
up estate or a part of it. Apropos (more or less), John
Tait, of great racing fame, in the ’forties kept the Black
Bull Inn, Bathurst, where Mrs. Tait’s cookery always
took first prize.
It appears that a Chow emperor assumes a
stage name, the same as a Pope, when he clam-
bers on the throne. The new one has taken a
name which means Promulgating Universally.
How can anyone take seriously a country that
calls its emperor Promulgating Universally ?
From “ Oby ” ;
Stewart Majoribanks Mowle, who has passed out at the
age of 86, spent 22 years as Usher of the Black Rod in
N.S. W. Parliament, and by reason of his profound con-
ception of the importance of that office provoked much of
the public desire to abolish it. Mowle came to Australia
young, but carried with him an intense veneration for
forms and ceremonies, and when he took over the Black
Rod billet he soaked his mind in British literature dealing
with that mystic stick. In his operatic garb, and with the
stick of office held in front of him, he became a Mowle
transfigured. On a couple of occasions he happened to
he accosted on his way to “knock at the door” and the
impression he created was that he was in a trance. He
neither saw nor heard, and looked straight ahead with
the glassy eye of one who walks in his sleep. An ancient
prophet about to foretell the slump of Babylon must have
looked like Mowle, barring the clothes—l fancy the
ancient prophets took off their clothes when about to
whoop. Apart from his pomp and his raiment Mowle was
an interesting personality.
A wonderful old scholar was that Dr. Eitel
whose death in Adelaide The Bulletin reported
last week. He used to go on learning things just
for the sake of learning them. He was one of the
world’s great Sanskrit authorities, and knew
Chinese well enough to write the standard
English-Chinese dictionary (Cantonese dialect).
Then he studied Buddhism and wrote books on
the subject—in Chinese. Then he decided to
drop China, after about 35 years of it—nearly half
of it as editor of the China Beview—so he came
on to South Australia, joined the big German
community there, became pastor of a little
Lutheran church, and then lecturer on German
language and literature at the Adelaide Uni-
versity. It took him a little over 70 years to doit
all; but he didn’t waste any time.
The Bulletin’s “ Oldest Inhabitant ”
writes :
Mr. S. M. Mowle was an Australian pioneer who, on
setting out in life, had no idea of winding up at 86 as a
Civil Service pensioner. Theancientgentleinan, whodied
at Woollahra (Sydney) on Saturday, was son of Richard
Mowle, of the Revenue Department, and was born in
Deal in 1821. At 16 years of age he came to Sydney.
He was schooled at Sydney College, where Mr. Cape was
headmaster. Among his surviving schoolfellows was
T. A. Browne (“ Rolf Boldrewood ”). Seventy years ago
young Mowle went with Terence Aubrey Murray for a
holiday, and reaching Yarrowlumla, near Queanbeyan,
he decided to go in for sheep-farming. They (Murray
and himself) subsequently settled at Canberra,
where Wade says there is plenty of water for a
Federal capital, but drought smothered their hopes,
and in the early ’fifties Mr. Mowle gave up all thought of
being a sheep king. In 1852 he became snb-eollector of
Customs and Water Police Magistrate at Eden ; in 1855 he
joined the Customs in Sydney ; in 1862 he exchanged
positions with Mr. McDermott, a clerk in the Legislative
Council. In 1883 he became “ Usher of the Black Rod,”
which foolish job he held until 1905, when at the age of
84 he retired. He was for many years secretary of tiie
Civil Service Club (long dead) and of the Civil Service
Musical Society, and was one of the first directors of the
C. S. Co-operative Society.
Mr. Robert Moodie (“Bob”), who died
on Sunday at North Sydney, aged 57 years, was
an old identity along the wharves and about the
Customs House. He was a son of the old-time
skipper and marine superintendent of the old
A. S. N. Co., Captain B. T. Moodie who sailed
the City of Sydney and other of the company’s
vessels half a century ago, when James Paterson
was manager and James Monro superintendent.
Thirty years ago, “Bob” Moodie and W. J.
Monro, son of James, entered into partnership
as Customs and shipping agents, but the prestige
of the old men didn’t follow the sons. Bob was
an alderman at North Shore and held other
public positions. They left him in St. Thomas’
Cemetery on Monday.
About a famous family :
A drunk ( cetat 50) was carried off to do 24 hours’ im-
prisonment in the Ballarat gaol, last Friday, protesting
with his last breath, as it were, that he was “ a younger
brother of the late Lord Chief Justice Coleridge of Eng-
land.” The reveller’s libations had got him mixed up, in
all likelihood, in the foliage of his family tree, as the
handbooks which are the recognised authorities in these
matters make no mention of anyone corresponding
to him. Yet has he chosen his titled family
more wisely, for deception purposes, than does
the average inebriate with a fixed idea anent the
prescriptive right of the British nobility to get drunk and
disorderly in foreign parts on the cheap. A Coleridge is
capable of almost anything, from enduring martyrdom by
fire in the cause of passive resistance to bearing the flam-
ing torch of a pro-drink jehad into the milk-bun-and-
prayer hall of a Y.M.C.A. The family has ever been as
eccentric as a leader of suffragettes. The old baron was in
his day the greatest “ ladies’ man ” in the United Kingdom.
After a long life spent basking in the approving smiles of
the sex, he did not hesitate to plunge into the
matrimonial flood while Chief Justice of England,
and a very old man indeed. His sons are barristers
and S.P.C.A. cranks. In their leisure moments they
speechify bitterly against the infamies of vivisection.
They were mainly responsible for the notorious Brown Dog
of Battersea monument (which, to the bitter annoyance of
the medical profession at large, depicts in realistic
fashion a hound of miserable aspect dying that fledgling
doctors may enjoy an afternoon sport with the scalpel),
and in other respects they keep up the reputation of
their house. It is said that a Coleridge who isn’t a tee-
totaller is invariably a dipsomaniac.
No end of bad luck seems to be flowing
the way of Freeman and Wallace, the “medical
institute” people who used to fill the papers with
whole pages of advts. Freeman, whose name is
Bosenberg, was the financial end of the firm;
Wallace, who was the medical end, says Freeman
was likewise the beginning and the middle of it.
Bight down to about three years ago he looked
like a man who was making a fortune; then the
whole house of cards tumbled in at once, and,
after an adverse verdict, he was made bankrupt.
In spite of the sort of business he carried on,
Freeman (whose name was Bosenberg) had a
really fine reputation in the city as a straight
business man ; but when things went against him
the Begistrar in Bankruptcy evidently reckoned
that he wriggled, wherefore lie was sent up to
Darlinghurst for a week, the other day, for “eva-
sion and prevarication.” - Meantime, Wallace,
said to be an old army doctor who (on his own
confession) flies to the whisky bottle for comfort,
has been struggling with a little money-lending
business for the better part of a year, and
reports that he had his pocket picked of
£lOO on Eight Hours Day. While- he was
supposed to be curing the suffering young
man in his “ laboratories ” in one part of Sydney,
he was really trying to lend the young man £1 on
personal security in a frowsy little office in another
part of it. It is all a sordid business, and shows
that you can’t always tell the “medical institute”
by its advt.
Poor 'old Mrs. China, senior, who died
lately at Pekin, has been pictured by a number
of the daily papers. A strangely various person
seems old Mrs. China, and most of the pictures
were calculated to make her shift round in her
grave. Some of them suggested a performing dog
with a skewer behind its ear rather than a human
NOTHING FOR US THIS TIME.
The caucus will in future have to crook the humble knee
and say, “ Yes, Mr. Deskill ! Argus.
ARGUS (consoling-like): “ Arfter all, when all’s
said an’ done, George, it’s a degrading posi-
tion to be in.”
GEORGE (doubtfully): “ Yerrs — I — s’pose — so, but
hoo!” (with a sudden explosion of his inner
feelings) “ wouldn’t I just like to crick the
humble back on the same terms!” (Breaks
down utterly.)
A Port Fairy (Vic.) auctioneer’s report,
the other day, ran like this :
Lot 1,9 a. lr. 35p., sold on behalf of T. Bent, £24 10s.

lot 4, allotment at Rosebrook, £94 ; lot 5, ditto ditto, £64;
lots 6 and 7, ditto, £46 ; lot 8, the rifle club paddock,
passed in at £44 per acre.
“ T. Bent,” “ T. Bent”— The Bulletin fancies it
has heard that name somewhere in connection with
a land-tax scheme that was dropped, or something
of that sort.
John Melville, who oversees the Toowong
Cemetery at Brisbane, and puts the ghosts to bed
at night, and tucks in the uneasy spirits, is the
sole survivor of A. C. Gregory’s expedition to
the Northern Territory in 1855-6. He is the
owner of Gregory’s diary, which was handed to
him by the author before his death. They were
great friends all through life. Melville is now 74
years old. The Queensland Government, some
day when it isn’t coalescing or State Frighting,
should secure that diary as an interesting his-
torical record.

Jake Garrard observed at Sydney
Water and Sewerage Board that Charles
Withers, the man who caused all the recent
trouble among the rockchoppers, “ deserves a
statue for his attitude.” The fox that lost his
tail and incited his kith and kin to get rid of
their tails also, was a genius just like Jake.
Garrard once figured as head and front of
N.S.W. Labor progressives. He was finan-
cially helped in Parliament, before payment of
members, by workers’ contributions. But the
Government laid traps, and one day he was
caught, and Parkes cut his tail off and hung the
brush over a despatch box on the Assembly table.
Archdeacon Giinther has doffed the hood
of authority in N.S.W. in favor of the returned
Bob-Cab Smith. It was in some respects a
troubled vice-reign. Deadbeat curates and rectors
had to be dodged. The Primate’s method used to
be the despatch of a letter informing applicant
“ Your communication has been received and will
be attended to.” That was generally all. The ap-
plicant, after waiting a long, long time, died or went
elsewhere. Or perhaps he wrote again, when he
once more received the response, “Your com-
munication has been received and will be attended
to.” But the Bev. Gunther carries a large heart,
and the miseries of the belated curate made it feel
sore.
Dr. Chewings, optimist and geologist, is
heading for the back parts of the Northern
Territory again, to try and solve some mineral
problems. He will start out from Victoria Bayer,
accompanied by two prospectors and 13 camels-

Government.
Ex-Chief Justice Alexander Campbell
Onslow, of Westralia, has died in England.
All his life he was pushed up-hill by family in-
fluence, but when he was pushed up one
> furlong he had a habit of slipping back
three. During his 17 years on the
W. A. Bench, there were m-
numorable “frictions. ’ Go-
vernor Broome suspended
him ; the Executive Council
suspended him ; the Colonial
Office remonstrated with
him ; and Lord Knutsford
censured him. Later the
W. A. Legislative Council
begged the Colonial Office to
transfer him to some other
dependency. H was Attorney-
General at Honduras before
arriving in Australia, and his
first billet in the West was
again that of A.-G. He died at 66, having cooled
down on his pension of £lOOO a year in the Isle of
Wight. His brother sat in N.S.W. Assembly, and
his grandfather on the mother’s side, Alexander
Macleay, was Speaker of N.S.W. Legislative
Council close on 70 years ago.
The voice of “Bloggs ” : —-
In re N.S.W.’s next Chief Justice, there is a possibility
that neither “1-3-6” nor “ 10-2-4 ” has considered. The
name of the said possibility is G. B. Simpson. He is the
senior puisne Judge. He is by universal consent the best
lawyer on the Bench. He possesses the requisite “pre-
sence,” has been in politics (a distinct advantage), and is
otherwise fitted for the job. In about 15 months he will
be entitled to retire on pension. When C.J. Darley took
a year’s holiday abroad a while back, Mathew Henry
Stephen was offered the post of acting-Chief Justice on
condition that he retired from the Bench when Darley
returned. It is not unlikely that the same procedure
will be followed in the c,se of G.B. When G.B.
qualifies for his pension, any one of the following three
things may occur : (1) Wade'may seize the C.J.-ship him-
self. That will shock the community in general and the
Bar in particular. (2) Pilcher may be appointed. The
Bar would be fairly satisfied if this occurred (it likes “ old
Pil ” personally, passing well); and the public would con-
sider it a fair thing and a fitting wind-up to a long and
bright career. (3) Adrian Knox may be the man. This
development would please the Bar vastly, but would
leave the outside public—which hardly knows its Knox—
cold and disinterested.
A NEW PHASE.
Much has been heard at various times about the pre-
valence of the mysterious disease “dry bible” in South
Australia, and the urgent need of a specific cure, so much
so that the Government of that State deputed Mr. Des-
mond to make a thorough investigation of the disease.—
Sydney D.T.
In the early days it ivas mostly “ wet bible ” that
the Government had to contend against.
About a family which runs to old age and
the Church
Mrs. Tristram Dunstan, who has died at Sackville
Reach, Hawkesbury River (N.S.W.), aged 87 years, was a
native of Wilberforce. The husband still lives, aged 92
last month. He has two brothers living—Benjamin Dun-
stan, of Wilberforce, aged 86 last January, and James
Dunstan, of Pitt Town, the youngest, aged 82 last month.
Mr. Dunstan’s sisters were Mrs. Everingham, who died
last December, aged 83 years, and Mrs. Fleming, who
died in June this year at the age of 89 years. Four sons
of Mr. and Mrs. Tristram Dunstan are clergymen of the
Anglican Church. One is Archdeacon of Mudgee.
Another is sin-shifting at Christ Church, Enmore. A third
gives the Devil a bad time at Warracknabeal (Vic.); and
the fourth treads on the tail of Beelzebub at Forbes. A
daughter is the wife of Archdeacon Howell, of Blayney,
and there are four other daughters. Like his wife, Mr.
Tristram Dunstan is a Hawkesbury native, and the couple
had lived on their farm at Upper Sackville for 40 years.

Mrs. Garrett Anderson, M.D., has been elected Mayor of
Aldsburgh. She is the first lady Mayor to be elected in
England.— Cable.
The chain of office on her bosom flashes,
Directoire robes her gracious curves display ;
And councillors make municipal hashes
Of eloquence when underneath her lashes
She looks at them —this way !
Dull talk of drains and sanitary matters
Are quite tabooed ; a sullen air of gloom
Distinguishes the man who only chatters
Of gutters, smells, and the bubonic ratters
When She has left the room.
Where once the ag6d howl of fury sounded
And heavy fists upon the table crashed,
Behold Her Worship gallantly surrounded,
And the same men that erstwhile leaped and bounded
Now Worshipfully mashed.

When to Use
Dr. Williams’
PINK PILLS
These Pills were origan-
ally a prescription used in
the doctor’s private practice
and their benefit to mankind
has been increased many
thousandfold by their being
placed on general sale with
the doctor’s own directions
for use. They are entirely
safe and contain no opiates
or other habit - forming
drugs.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
are the remedy to use when
the blood is thin as in
anaemia; or impure, as in
rheumatism ; or when the
nerves are weak, as in neu-
ralgia , or lifeless, as in par-
tial paralysis ; or when the
body as a whole is ill nou-
rished, as in general debil-
ity. They build up the blood,
strengthen the nerves and
have cured troubles of
women and growing girls
and many forms of weak-
ness. That hundreds of
people have tried the treat-
ment with good results is
shown by the increasing
number of cures reported.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are sold by
all chemists and storekeepers or will be
sent, postpaid, on receipt of price, 2/9
per box; six boxes 15/3, by the Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Co. of Australasia,
Ltd., Sydney.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Premier Kidston, of Queensland, has al-
ready had to speak severely to his motley follow-
ing, and he threatened to resign unless the Tory
crowd which he has taken into his party ceases to
plot against him. By speaking in a loud voice
and sticking his chest out as far as it would go he
restored some kind of order; but there are
abundant signs that Kidston will have to take the
carving-knife to bed with him for fear of political
assassination in the dead of night.
The Victorian House of Rich Landlords
has passed the Woman’s Suffrage Bill after reject-
ing it about 17 times. That is what Upper Houses
are for—to make the Lower House do one piece of
work 18 times over when, if there were no Upper
House, once would be enough. The Upper House
always gives in at the end, but its dunderheaded-
ness and obstinacy cause a fearful amount of delay,
worry and expense.
It is a lamentable thing when any Parlia-
ment gets into the habit of allowing important
matters to become chronic. The Australian
capital has become chronic, and how long it will
remain chronic Heaven only knows. A tendency
to let the Northern Territory become chronic
now begins to appear on the horizon, and it can’t
be suppressed too promptly. Australia doesn’t
want its Parliament to become a Home for In-
curable Problems.
ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY.
The political situation had been to some extent re-
lieved by the resignation of Mr. Reid as leader of the
Opposition. It would now be quite possible to reorganise
and consolidate the forces in the House opposed to
Socialism and Labor domination. —A significant Tory ad-
mission.
Nov, did he jump, or was he pushed?
(And, in any case, is he dead?)
The Peel River (N.S. W.) land resumptions
hang fire. Justice Sly and two assessors have
been appointed to decide on the value of the land.
The Court held its first meeting last week, and
did some preliminaries. But the assessor for the
land monopolists can’t sit in January, and the
Judge wants his holidays, and the various horse-
hairs don’t want to toil during the long vacation.
So the Board has decided to meet again on Febru-
ary 1 and see what’s doing. This probably means
that the 1909 season will be lost, all on account of
the dilatoriness of those who wear the tail of the
gallant steed upon their heads and put on a petti-
coat when they are going to address his ’Onah.
It is noted up North that Judas Kidston
keeps his line of retreat open—to the Agent-
General’s office. A probable early readjustment
of portfolios was reckoned upon ; hence Butter-
man Denham’s appointment to the Lands Office,
while Joey Bell goes to the Home Department, the
latter being an easier stepping-stone to the
Premiership. But Kidston has become a State
Frighter ; and a State Brighter as Agent-General
would be almost, if not quite, as disastrous as a
State Frighter at the Premier’s quarters.
The other afternoon, in the S. Aus. Assem-
bly, Architect Smeaton, of the Labor party, got
something-like a gentle hint. When the House
had knocked off talk the previous sitting, Smeaton
had been speaking for 3J hours on the Licensing
question and still wasn’t through. By way of a
hint that things had gone nearly far enough,
Ponder pasted the proofs of Sineaton’s few un-
finished remarks end on and trailed them into the
House after him. The streamer was 15ft. long.
It had the desired effect —Smeaton only talked
4ft. more.
If the new Australian Government pro-
poses to give itself a fair chance it ought to get to
work early on a Second Ballot Bill in order to
abolish minority representation. At last election
the minority representatives who got into Parlia-
ment were John Thomson (N.S.W.), Agar
Wynne (Vic.), J. G. Wilson (Vic.), J. T. Brown
(Vic.), C. 0. Salmon (Vic.), John Mathews (Vic.),
Robert Harper (Vic.), and L. Atkinson (Tas.).
All that crowd might have been thrown out on a
second ballot, and if the Labor party thinks care-
fully over those eight men it will find that they
are mostly persons whom it could do without.
By “ Galleryite ” :
There was an unrehearsed effect wnen Arthur Griffith
took his seat in the Assembly after the return of the writ
from the uncontested Sturt election the other day. Pro-
ceedings in committee were interrupted immediately
after the tea adjournment to enable him to be introduced
and sworn in. This was by arrangement between the
Premier and the leader of the Opposition. Also by arrange-
ment, the introduction was to be done by McGowen,
but the call boy was negligent, and when the time
came for the dramatic re-entry of the recent member
he was not to be found. The Speaker took the chair and
looked inquiringly at the House ; Labor members cleared
their throats preparatory to cheering their colleague ;
Wade tried to look unconcerned ; and McGowen looked
for Griffith. But Griffith was late. McGowen hurried
hither and thither—he looked behind the Speaker’s chair,
under the chair, in the library, in the lobbies—but no
Griffith could be found. Hollis joined in the search, and
two or three messengers hurried themselves in a stately,
professional sort of way. At last they dug Griffith out
from the front of a looking-glass, where he was glancing
over the arrangement of his n6glig6 shirt and’tie and
generally overhauling himself. McGowen collared him
with the grip of a policeman, hauled him into the cham-
ber, and dragged him up alongside the Speaker’s chair.
And, with much dignity, the Speaker proceeded to
administer the oath of allegiance, only he got hold of the
affirmation instead of the oath, and after the first few
words there was more confusion until the ever-watchful
Arnold came to the rescue and put things right. Then
Griffith swore as prescribed in the Constitution, and took
his seat.
Great and wonderful is the slump in
British trade. During the first ten months of
1908 Bull’s commerce was £99,517,306 less than in
the first ten months of 1907. For the month of
October alone the fall amounted to over
£12,000,000, as compared with October, 1907.
There is a rapidity about this downvvardness
which is calculated to shake the public faith in
almost anything—even the Freetrade disease.
Yet with all the awful poverty that this
decline involves, the difficulty about getting
voluntary soldiers of the requisite height and
stomach measurement to serve in the British
army—the best-paid army in Europe—increases.
Counting regulars, volunteers, militia, and re-
serves, the British army of Ed. VII. is 74,000 men
smaller now than it was three years ago. The
trouble isn’t the want of men ; it lies in the fact
that poverty and under-feeding have so reduced
the height and tummy-circumference of the men
offering that the proportion of rejections is out of
all reason. The British unemployed and their
families, by the way, were lately reckoned at
7,500,000 people, and the Treasury deficit at the
end of the financial year is expected to be between
£15,000.000 and £22,000,000.
“ Green Tape ” writes :
Another illustration of the vagaries of N.S.W. land laws
Ever since the days of Cook a small piece of land has been
peacefully lying about near Cooma. Last year someone
in authority conceived a bright idea, and wrote out a few
remarks in the Government Gazette stating that the land
was “available” within the meaning of the Act. The
whole district applied for it, and, also within the meaning
of the Act, it all applied “ simultaneous!v.” The Land
Board by a majority decided that the whole lot deserved
the land. One Wilmott, it was held, deserved it most, and
one Kaufline deserved it least; the others came in be-
tween. All the crowd took the decision lying down,
except Kaufline, who was said to have deserved the land
least. He appealed and sent a money order for £5 as de-
posit. Wilmott thereupon lodged an objection against the
appeal on the ground that the money order wasn’t legal
tender, and, therefore, not a legal deposit. The money
order was issued in the name of the Commonwealth, and
a long course of Carruthers and Wade and their anti-
Federal talk was too much for Wilmott. Both
the Land Appeal Court and the Supreme Court have de-
cided that Australia is good for £5, and has accepted the
money order at its face value. Wilmott isn’t legally dead,
however, and has fired one or two more objections. These
will be heard by the Full Court, then probably bv the
High Court. If Kaufline wins these, his appeal will have
to be heard on its merits, by about four tribunals. Mean-
while, the land is still peacefully tying around down
Cooma way.
Now it is Kirton, M.L.A. (of Victoria),
who is finding out that it is hard to be a friend of
Bent’s and escape suspicion. Bent made Kirton
Chairman of the Ballarat Water Commission,
whereupon he resigned from the House, and re-
entered it at last election. While he was a pri-
vate citizen Kirton acted as agent over the
purchase of a block of 14 acres for workmen’s
houses, and naturally drew commission—£sB of
it. There wasn’t anything illegal in that, but it
is being remarked that the price the Government
paid for the land, £lOO per acre, is a trifle steep,
seeing that the same land is said to have been
sold for £65 per acre only two months previously ;
also it is remarked that, though this transaction
happened four years ago, the land has not been
cut up or sold to this day. Further, it seems
that Kirton was paid 4 per cent, commission,
while the usual charge for such work is 2J per
cent., and even the 2J per cent, isn’t usually paid
by the purchaser. Bent, of course, has explained
how it all happened; but Bent’s explanations
don’t generally put things any forrarder.
PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS COMPANY.
I notice in a paper which devotes much attention to
me that I am referred to as a person who has an insati-
able greed for office. On that I should only like to make
one remark—that office in such circumstances as those
which have prevailed during the continuance of the
Deakin Ministry would be a degradation which I should
be slow indeed to face.—REID in Federal Parliament.
THE POLITICAL WRECK: “ I’d he ashamed to he
seen in the company that Deakin keeps.”
The “ Old Soldier ” on the Federal capital
area :
The State capitals have grown by a natural process,
having unlimited room to expand, which the Federal
capital cannot have unless the space is given to it. Now
here’s a consideration that has apparently occurred to no-
body so far. If the Commonwealth wants —or needs, let
us say—to fortify its capital, what area will it require for
the city? There will, of course, be the city with its
surrounding rampart, then there will be the circle
of detached forts to keep besiegers at such a dis-
tance that the capital itself can’t be bombarded. Here
are some European examples. The Germans, since they
have possessed Strasburg, have surrounded it with a
circle of detached forts 17 miles in diameter. Add to
that a further space of three miles wide all round cor-
responding to the range of the guns of the fOrts, and
you have a necessary area of 530 square miles. The circle
of forts round Paris has a mean diameter of 20 miles ;
add the “ rayon,” as the engineers call it, of three miles,
and the area required (minimum area, mind) is nearly 700
square miles, which the Commonwealth is entitled to
claim, so that, in ease of need, of which it is the sole
judge, it may fortify its capital. That is leaving water
supply, drainage outlet and other questions wholly out of
consideration.
Up to October Australia’s policy of en-
couraging certain industries by bounties hadn’t
led to any very large shovelling out of money.
The total amount paid away was £lO6l, of which
Tasmania secured £932 and Westralia £B9. The
other States had £4O among them.
FORCE OF HABIT.
Mr. G. H. Reid, M.H.R., replying to an enthusiastic
welcome given him at Yass, said that the capital selec-
tion met with the approval of the whole of the people
of Australia.
PROMINENT CITIZEN OF YASS : “ But I say , Mr.
Reid, are you quite sure that the selection is
final ?”
GEORGE : “ Urn, ah! Well, you see, if the capital
isn't here it'll he somewhere else, so it’s all
the same.”
The Sydney Telegraph is busy fixing the
position of the Australian capital all on its own.
It seems it is to be at Dog-Trap, between Yass and
Canberra — the ’Graph published a photo of the
place on November 18. The name, at least, is
appropriate. Certain people turned dog and
Australia fell into a trap. The photo. shows no
particular points about the place ; but anyhow it
has the ad vantage of being Dog-Trap.
The anti-Australian or Free-
trader, who holds that his country
can’t make anythin", blushes right
down to his boots these days when-
ever he bumps into a N.S.W. railway
engineman. Awhile back Wade’s
Anti-Sosh Government, goaded by
the pertinacity of certain opponents,
determined to prove that locomotives
could not be profitably and capably
manufactured by the State, and to
that end ukased that the Eveleigh
(Sydney) workshop people should
try their hands on 10 of the puffing
Williams. So far, three of the
Statemade machines are running on
the lines, and the drivers who get
the chance to climb their foot-
plates reckon that their luck’s in.
“They’re just the thing,” say the
men; “it’s a treat to drive them
after bullocking on some of the
cranky, imported rattletraps.” Also
it is calculated that the reasonable
cost (although the cost includes the
price of plant, which won’t apply
to the next batch of engines) of
the initial 10, when it is finally
figured out, will shock those good
Anti-Sosh people, who reckoned
and hoped that the experiment would
prove the State-manufacture of loco-
motives to be a financial impossibility.
“Australia should spend £6,000,000
a year on land and sea defence,” says
Queensland exMinister Peter Airey. And
Peter Airey is right. In a wicked world of
robbery and brigandage, a handful of cadets
and a theory about the -loveliness of peace are
very poor weapons.
Bent is indeed a master of courtesy.
Criticised by Prendergast, the Labor leader, on
some matter or other in the Vic. Assembly the
other day, he uttered no coarse rebuke such as
might be found in the mouths of his inferior sup-
porters. He merely said : “ You are sorry because
you didn’t get that billet, because I didn’t offer
it to you.” It was a dignified utterance, a
pleasant reminder of his shameless political in-
decencies. He reproves his critics, not with violent
revilings nor with cynical sneers, but with the
politest mud. It is possible to feel admiration for
such an artist. In politics he has the tastes of a
scavenger and the diplomatic methods of a mad-
dened pachyderm.
AN EMBARRASSING DECLARATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are those who still believe that Protection is an
economic error of the most fundamental kind —S. M.
Herald, Sl/101’08.
They are about ! You find them here and there,
Scattered around—a dull and dismal band
Of human ostriches who, tails in air,
Bury their heads deep in the drifted sand.
They still exist, though patient Reason stays
Its progress for a space to give them light,
And with its gamp their buried heads to raise ;
(Whene’er it does, the addled things show fight!)
You can’t prevent it! Hit them hard with facts,
The plumage of Rank Ignorance alway
Preserves their pelts, while, ’mid their barren tracts
They burrow deeper from the. light of day.
“ There are those who ” —Yes, yes, we must admit
There are, but why parade the shameful fact ?
If in the house some lacking are in wits,
To tell the world argues a want of tact.

BUCHANAN WHISKY—
“BLACK & WHITE.”
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, November 24, 1908.
My Dear Arini, —
Dear old sailor-man Rawson’s term as Governor
of N.S.W. is running out, and feelers are stirring
with regard to a memorial. The Sailors’ Home,
the old man-o’-war’s special hobby, is badly in
need of funds—it is miserably housed—but that is
not regarded by some people as personal enough
in the way of a memorial. The statue to Gover-
nor Bourke at the Domain gates was the work of
public subscription; and Governor Young was
presented with £5OO and a service of plate by pub-
lic subscription. These are the two cases that the
movers of the feelers before-mentioned keep
most in mind.
I grow slightly bored with the excursions and
alarums anent the long-bruited Elkins-Abruzzi
marriage that occur week by week in the place
the Reuter’s cables come from. The thing that
outstands most palpably is that the female
relatives of both the principals are bitterly
opposed to the match. This is not sur-
prising. About 200 American girls have mar-
ried titled foreigners in the last decade.
The ones that haven’t been either divorced,
separated, deserted, or walloped may almost be
numbered on the thumb of one hand. The
Duke is an attractive and extremely able
man. But he is no eremite. And —as is
the royal fashion in Europe—he has never
made the slightest pretence at hiding the cheerful
aspect of his character. It is a trait in the ducal
character that is not calculated to appeal to the
middle-class mind of the upper-class American
female. That Queen Margharita, the Duchess of
Aosta, and other relatives of the Abruzzi Duke
should be opposed to Miss Elkins as a bride is also
understandable. Senator Elkins—that proud old
Republican—insisted clamantly that his daughter
should be made a royal princess if she married
the Duke. The precedent would be unspeakably
disastrous from the point of view of royal matrons
with more or less unalluring princesses to get
off their hands. If the daughter of an American
Senator, why not the poor but honest child
of a British Inspector of Nuisances? If a
non-working maiden from the U.S.A., why
not some strenuous leaper in the ranks of an
Empire (London) ballet? The law that stamps
as morganatic the marriage of a royal person with
a commoner is the royal female’s matrimonial
s:ilvation. To ask her to acquiesce calmly in the
discrediting of it is tantamount to asking an edu-
cated modern nation which has known Protection
to revert to Freetrade—a self-evident absurdity.
The she-royalty cherishes the morganatic marriage
business even as the Prohibition enthusiast in a
‘ ‘ gone dry ” Maoriland electorate does the whisky-
keg in his cellar. L’egoisme (which is a stronger
consideration even than noblesse) oblige.
Mrs. Allen Taylor, after eight months’ wander-
ings through the United Kingdom, with excursions
to the capitals of France and Germany, gives
the soothing assurance that we are just as well-
dressed as the women in the fashion-creating
centres. She saw nothing of the huge hats and
startling sheath skirts—save on the stage of a
theatre or two, where they were worn as a “skit”
on the reigning fashion. Ten thousand miles was
whatthe Taylors’ motor-car registered after the trio
had “done ” the English and Irish Lakes districts
and sundry other jobs in the beauty-spotting line.
This fortunate family brought back three motor
cars. That’s one each—papa, mamma and sonny
Forster. The joy of possessing a herd of motor
cars must transcend that of going into Nirvana,
or any other big thing in the joyous line. If I
had them I’d drive one and tow the other two,
and be a procession of riches. Like a good Aus-
tralian, Mrs. Taylor didn’t bother about bringing
a swag of curios back with her to litter up the
house. Everything that any normal person wants
may be got in Australia. Even if a tiger is wanted
Mr. Reid has a disused animal for sale. Which
reminds me that Mrs. Taylor has the most gorgeous
tiger that ever burned in the forests of the night,
as the poet has it. He is dead, of course, and
mounted as a rug. The lady is justly incensed at
the “tipping” pest in English hotels, and
would have the employees get a living wage, even
if the guests’ charges have to be increased. House-
maids and waiters at the frilly hotel at which the
Taylors dwelt for three months in London got but
7s. 6d. a week, so no wonder their tongues were
always hanging out for more coin.
The Colin Stephens have just returned from
foreign parts on the Ophir. The lady was one of
the Knox girls—a sister of the K.C. whose name
is being mentioned very persistently in connection
with the N.S.W. Chief Justiceship. Her husband
is a lawyer of some tonnage, one of the best
amateur riders in this State, and the owner (under
the nom de horse of “ C. Barlow ”) of some smart
racehorses, with one of which he scored a profit-
able win at last Melbourne Cup meeting.
The marriage of Mr. R. A. Olive and Miss
Elenore Maher, which takes place at Collaroy
station within the next few days, is of more than
Ma State interest. The groom, who has been
jackerooing these half-dozen years on Collaroy—
famed for the amazingly high quality of its stud
sheep—is a son of General Clive, and the General
is a direct descendant of the Clive who made the
gentle Indian nigger to sit up so violently. Mr.
R. A. Clive is the only member of his family who
is actively engaged in the pastorgl business, his
brothers being Guardsmen and such-like in the
Cold Land. General Clive and a brother own
Collaroy between them, and the father of Miss
Maher (he is a brother of Sydney’s Dr. Odillo
Maher) manages it for them.
Christmas, the time of pies, presents, holidays
and good times generally, will soon be here. As
there is a minority—let us hope it is a minority—
to which not only pies and presents but good
health and sufficiency of bread and milk are
strangers, it would be; a gentle deed for you to cut a
corner off your Christmas abundance and give
it to the less fortunate. The Child Study
Association desires to give its poor little patients
a special Christmas treat, and is appealing for
subscriptions in money, toys, refreshments, cloth-
ing, etc. As Christmas falls on a Friday, it has
been decided to hold the proposed treat on
December 18 at “Hollywood,” Botany-street,
Waverley, from 3.30 p.m. onwards. Gifts will be
suspended from trees, and refreshments, such as
milk, fruit, nuts, raisins, figs, etc., will be served.
Donations maybe sent to Mrs. Izett, “Holly-
wood,” Waverley; or they will be received by
Miss Hackett at the Australian Chambers, 289
Pitt-street, Sydney.
The Goulds—the fresh paint of knighthood still
damp on them—have promised the loan of their
grounds at ‘ ‘ Eynesburv ” for the production of
“As You Like It ” on December 1, in aid of the
Rawson Memorial Fund.
Cards are out from Ward’s Own Land for
December 15 to celebrate the silver wedding of
the Joseph Ward brace. On the same day and
date will be celebrated the marriage of their son
Cyril to Miss Davidson.
A section of Sydney society seems delighted at
the return of Mrs. de la Salle, who was Miss
Ethel Stephen, daughter of late S. A. Stephen,
and niece of Mrs. Monty Severn. The newly-
returned is a pretty little party. She married in
the Bull Country some 10 years ago, and hubby
owns one of the stately homes of England—in
Hampshire.
Another returned is one of Sydney’s prettiest—
Miss Nora Dangar, from India. The Abbey
Dangars are also amongst the people who have
showed taste and sense in returning to this city
by the sea.
Waverley Bowling Club grabbed at the very
slender excuse of its green being top-dressed, and
closed for six weeks, to make a festive afternoon
of its re-opening on Saturday. Mrs. Fullwood,
wife of the club’s president, rolled a bowl down
the green, and so was the sward again declared fit
for the tread of canvas-shod feet.
A fortunate young man is Dr. Watson. For
months past he has been winning every steeple-
chase of any importance with his horse Pilot,
which he picked up for an old warble the other
day. And now his wife has presented him with a
brand new daughter. Mrs. Watson was a Miss
Marks of “Elystan,” cousin of Miss Irene Marks,
and sister-in-law of the pretty Mrs. Herbert of
that ilk.
Some lines from the letter of a Sydneysider
still at large in the bull’s-eye of the Empire :
“We are staying at the Langham, and what
chiefly delights us is seen in the vestibule, which
is nearly as large as the winter garden of the Aus-
tralia. People are here from every part of the
world, and most of the women are frocked en-
trancingly. We call the vestibule Peacock Alley.
Everything here is directoire, and the corsets are
a regular harness. I saw several beautifully-
gowned women who had to have some assistance
from the men with them when they wanted to rise
from their lounges, and one lady could not sit
down properly—she kind of perched or hovered
on the edges of chairs. By these signs ye
may know the harness corset. I consider
we are most fearfully behind in Aus-
tralia. I bought the latest hats from there,
but could not wear them—they weren’t enormous
enough, so I went out and got a large black satin
hat and some ruffles and brought myself up to
date, and of course I had to repress my hips with
harness.
“ All the well-known French houses have glass
cases at the Shepherd’s Bush Exhibition, with wax
models of women frocked in empire or directoire
style, and the whole suite of clothes to wear with
them ; but only a thin, white, accord eon-pleated,
satin petticoat, and satin bloomers. They show the
most fetching garters, with engraved silver buckles
clasping them. This is the land of dogs—no
woman of any pretensions goes out without one.
So far we have not tried to rise to higher things
by associating ourselves with smart setters—
Gordon or other kind. These smart, dogs are
sometimes dressed like Missus. One we saw had
a coat of pale-ale velvet and ruffles of the same
hue. So had the lady who owned him. The
Horderns’ clothes will be a revelation to Sydney,
so beautiful are they. They and their clothes will
reach you by Christmas. The Sydney Kidmans—
of the S.A. cattle-king family—are here also, but
don’t bother themselves over smartness of any
kind—dogs, dress or people. The Tobins —
Melbourne people—are very up-to-the-minute
in their gowning.”
Browsing through one of the advance proofs of
The Lone Hand for January, “ The Science of
Singing,” by Nellie Melba, nearly drew the eyes
out of my dome as I read with various and ad-
miring emotions. In the course of a lengthy and
absorbingly interesting article, Melba discusses
the physiology or the science of song. She herself
“became at one time so completely absorbed in
the study that she could neither think nor speak
of anything else.” And she insists that “no
student should be content to proceed without
gaining a reasonable knowledge of the anatomy of
the throat and the sensitive and complicated
physical mechanism that produces the singing
voice.” She scourges incompetent teachers, and
declares that a beautiful voice is only the basis of
vocal progress, in the perfection of which correct
breathing is the greatest technical essential.
Melomaniacs will welcome the Melbian contri-
bution to the magazine.
Miss Justina Wayne, the damsel who plays
Claudia, the grown-up, in “The Prince Chap,”
has a luxuriant head of hair. The audiences have
been mistaking it for a wig, and asking “Why
did she choose such a pale shade?” Her hair,
like Beatrice’s, is the color it pleased Heaven to
make it, and Heaven made it so fair as to be a
straw tint. No man, least of all a doting foster
father like the Prince Chap, could resist that
innocent-looking hair—especially when the hairess
wears a white frock.
The baby of the Union Steamship Co.’s fleet is
the biggest of the family. It is alleged to be
bigger than the P. and O. liner China. And the
Makura, as it is named, is the best-looking,
for it has had the advantage of the latest
skill in fashioning, and its complexion is
freshly laid on. On Friday a luncheon was
given on board the new vessel to more than
200 somebody males. I have the menu smiling
before me. If any of the guests ate through it
they must feel even at this date like the python
(there’s only one python in Sydney) after he has
absorbed two goats, a chicken, ten eggs, and a
bucket of milk. Mr. G. H. Reid was one of the
speakers; Captain Napier, R.N., said “Haw”
beautifully in replying to the chairman for the toast
of the “ Navy and Army” ; and Dr. Coulter, Post-
master-General for Canada, purred statesmanlike
nothings. In the afternoon, Captain Gibb, who
commands the new craft, gave tea to a number of
the sex that screams when a storm is raging and
asks, “O, captain, will the ship founder?”
Mr. and Mrs. Tommy Burns have a cottage at
Medlow. Abiding with them are a trainer and
two maids. Tommy walks 10 miles a day, and
his missus seems full of the peace of which Holy
Writ speaks—that which the world cannot give or
take away. Mr. Johnson, who is to meet Burns
presently and “ knock his face off,” has a cottage
Botanywards, and women go down in motors
to watch him sparring with his trainer. Strange
taste ! Johnson’s wife is a pretty little party.
Lately, desiring to show portraits of her dear
undeparted to some women, she took them into
her dream-cubicle, and amongst other curios that
the dazed visitors noted were two large, real ele-
gant wall-pockets containing (1) a sweet thing in
pale-blue silk nighties, and (2) a coon variety-
artist’s suite of pyjamas with stripes that sang
loudly off the key.
“Mario” sends some notes from Brisbane :
The Government House people have put in a strenuous
week. Their toil commenced with the welcoming of
Archbishop Donaldson on Monday at 4 o’clock, and only
ended late on Saturday evening with the concert of the
Russian infants whose name somehow recalls a sneeze of
Scotch descent; so, like Bunthorne, they didn’t even get
the usual half-holiday. The Archbishop had a fearful and
wonderful welcome home—a bungle of bungles all through.
The only cheerful interlude was the tea on the lawn
opposite the grandstand at the Exhibition Grounds.
The usual gushy young things formed a halo round the
soulful, ginger-haired Selby Lownes and his rapidly
fattening head of the Church, while the plump and
smiling Archdeacon (who possesses a wife) was left quite
out in the cold. Later, at the meeting, organist George
Sampson swelled sweet sounds, and everyone talked
cathedral and felt stuck up over his or her begging mis-
sion—all except the Archbishop, who had to confess that
he hadn’t got an English brown towards the construction
of the holy edifice. This utter failure he tried to excuse
with the plea that there were about 500 other “ colonial ”
bishops at the Pan-Anglican shivoo, each and all clamor-
ing for backsheesh, and as nobody had ever heard of
Brisbane or its cathedral, the attempt at raising money
was worse than useless.
On Tuesday we put on our best clothes and opened
Parliament. There was nothing inspiring in the way of
ceremony, but the officers that followed his Ex. into the
chamber were a goodly-looking crew. Among the frockers
pride of place must certainly be given to the Anglican
Archbishop, who swept into the chamber in a perfectly,
lovely red robe, with a chest protector of what a
certain Mrs. Malaprop once called “vermin.” Wrapped
in these burdens he nearly expired from the heat
ere the long, long Speech was ended. His rotund little
Mayorship, in his black draperies and massive chains,
didn’t look nearly so not. Our GovernoresS has seldom
made such an effective entrance as she did on that occa-
sion in her hand-embroidered cream robes apd big white
hat, upon which trails of white wisteria were laid in
delicate profusion. Mrs. Kidston evidently felt her
husband’s position. Neglecting her recently-acquired
London and Paris modes and robes, she mourned the
occasion in a very so-so net and lace blouse, a skirt of
mere black, and a purple hat that had seen better days
and many of them. The new Ministers’ wives were all
fuss and feathers. Mrs. Home Secretary Joey alone
looked as if she were at home in her clothes. I noticed
the pretty bride of Assistant Usher of the Black Rod
Gregory in a dainty white gown and a simple summer
hat. The missus of the new clerk of the Assembly draped
herself in black silk and lace.
On Thursday, her frigjd Excellency thawed entirely
upon the Kangaroo Point bank of our big river as she
opened and christened the new boatshed of the Brisbane
Ladies’ Rowing Club, of which she is patroness. The
girls themselves looked as if their aquatic sport were
doing them a heap of good.
On Friday, that long-threatened reform, the infants’
ward at the Sick Children’s,Hospital, was opened at last.
It look the whole Thesiger clan to do the deed, to say
nothing of the Archbishop and about 800 other folks.
The ward is a true open-air structure. Only half of the
space boasts of walls, and these are mostly windows.
The front half has only enough glass screen to avert
damage by storm. On the same occasion the operating
theatre built out of the income of the Moffatt legacy
was thrown ope'n. Several of these ladies assured me that
the diphtheria ward would be begun right away. Ex-
matron Best, now Mrs. Alex. Stewart, presented the 20
or so cots.
Mrs. Gertie Gerald Hanbury is back again from Fog-
town on the Thames. She came, so the captain informed
me, by the Ophir, but has been invisible so far. I hear,
however, that she is a slim and elegant returnee.
Lady Chelmsford has once more arisen, and has in
stern tones announced her determination of founding a
Pure Milk Depot, where reformed cows will give reformed
milk at a cost of something like Is. a gallon. She has
issued an invitation for all persons prepared to assist in
securing reformed bovines to meet at the vice-regal lodge
next week and talk the matter over. A nurse and doc-
tors will then be installed to deal out seven bottles of
suitable fluid weekly per infant.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
“D.” speaks a piece :
Sydney Evening News devoted a sub-leader, the other
afternoon, to a weird improbability anent Hock Keys, ex-
champion lightweight of Australia. Keys while training
“up Beveridge way” was alleged to have gone out
rabbit-shooting - . He was approached by “a keeper”
who instructed him to desist from further slaughter. An
argument followed, in the course of which Keys, accord-
ing to the News, “ took off his coat, and administered ‘ a
mild tap ’ between the eyes of Mr. Keeper that caused
him to see something like one hundred thousand con-
stellations in the course of five seconds. When he re-
covered himself it entered the head of Mr. Keeper to ask,
‘Who the are you?’ ‘Well,’ was the reply, ‘I am
known in the boxing world as Hock Keys.’ The story
concludes with the immediate departure of Mr. Keeper.”
It is a tale that will cause anyone who has encountered
Hock to smile uproariously. The “ I am known in the
boxing world ” gag is painfully unlike this unrhetorieal
citizen ; but infinitely more so is the keeper-smiting
feat. Keys is noted for being as harmless in private life
as a prize bulldog. He would flee ten miles to escape
trouble, verbal or physical.
And apropos, here is another yarn of a mild pug who
was most dangerous in the ring, but not out of it. He
told it to me himself.
“Yer see that bloke?”—pointing to a small, furtive-
looking wayfarer on the other side of the street. “He
done me a crool injury onct. The day wuz steamin’ ’ot,
un I wuz walkin’ along dreamin’ o’cold beers, un not
’avin’a bean t’buy one wiv—it bein’ one o’the periods
durin’ which I wuz up agin ded ’ard moz-w’en up ’is
nibs comes, and sezzee: ‘ Sam, comeanavadrink ! ’ I
follered. Inside the pub ’e struck two cobbers. ‘ Wot’ll yer
’ave?’ ’e sez ter ther blokes, ignorin’ me abserlootly.
‘ Beer,’ they sez. ‘ I’ll ’ave a drop o’ beer, too,’ sez I ter the
barman. Brought ther beer wuz, and I wuz just reachin’
out fer mine when I noticed the other blokes all ’ad their
backs turned to me. ‘ Gen’l’man with you?’ sez the bar-
man ter the feller wot’d arsked me in. ‘No !’ sez the
bloke. I seen it all. ’E’d bin pullin’ me leg. Wot with
longin’ fer the beer, which I ’adn’t ther brass ter pay fer,
andFilin’ anger agin the feller that ’ad made a show uv
me, I wuz well-nigh frantic. I explained me position ter
the’barman und pushed the beer back, feelin’ fair sick.
Suddent, a thort struck me. ’ Put it under the counter,’
I sez, ‘ and wait. I’ll show ’im ’e can’t play fast-und-loose
with yer ’umble. ’ Straight as a die I went ter the Monty
Peet and pawned me weskit. I come back ter the pub.
The blokes wuz still there—larfin’ at me I don’t doubt.
‘ ’And over the beer,’ I sez ter ther barman, plankin’ down
ther needful. ’E done so. Yer should ’ave seen that
bloke’s face. ’Owever, I said nothin’ —I’d ’a’ considered it
beneath me to talk ter such a nark. ’Avin’ drunk up, I
walked calmly out, givin’ me beauty as I parst one look
o’ witherin’ contempt. My grashus ! it wuz a fine revenge.”
That pug is dead now - , but he wasn’t an absolutely
unique specimen.
Premier Joe Ward, of Maoriland, wasn't
in Ballance’s original team, and only got office
when Patrick A. Buckley found he couldn’t con-
veniently double the parts of Attorney-General
and Postmaster-General; but, even if he didn’t
start off scratch, he has managed to be a few
things—Postmaster-General, Treasurer, Commis-
sioner of Customs, Minister of Marine, Electric
Telegraph Commissioner, Minister of Industries
and Commerce, Minister for Railways, Minister
of Public Health, Colonial Secretary, Minister of
Finance, Minister of Defence, and Prime Minister
(good old John Ballance was quite satisfied to be
plain Premier and Treasurer instead of Prime
Minister and Minister of Finance). And finally
Joseph created the office of Minister of Tourist
and Health Resorts, and put that extra bit of frill
on to himself.
Last week it was mentioned that the com-
mittee of the National party in Sydney had
received £4B ss. 3d. in support of the Unification
and Reconstruction Campaign. This, of course,
was the amount received since the last overhaul
of the accounts, referred to in The Bulletin at
the time it took place.
About Wood:—
N.S.W. Chief-Secretary Wood’s totally unnecessary
scream at Clontarf the other day was characteristic of the
man. Wood had nothing to gain by attending the Yellow
Pup jamboree, and, anyhow, he only nagged at and ex-
asperated the pups when he got there. The fact is he
went after stoush, and scrap, and uproar and verbal
insult—an environment that is the breath of life to Wood.
There are people who argue that Wood in raising fights is
laying to his book. But it is not so. Those who know
the thin man with the hat that resembles a dinted salmon
tin on a pole are well aware that it is his nature to
wrangle where an Irish terrier would yap with good
humor. Wood is capable of raising howls of dissent at a
marriage, or at the deathbed of a nun, or at an inquest. If
everybody else was dead he would take on an all-night
sitting with himself before a mirror, and end up by break-
ing the glass and spitting through the hole. He would
tongue-fight a female conferencer, or a pickle bottle, or a
volcano, or the German Kaiser, or the Last Trump or a
full hand of trumps. There are those who say that Wood
will one day be Premier. God forfend ! Wade, in com-
parison with Wood, is a merry, sunqy-natured optimist.
Were Wood Premier he would take a point of order on
himself when he opened the session, rule himself out of
order, bash the Speaker with 48 copies of Hansard, foam
at the mouth, adjourn the session for six years, and set
fire to the Constitution in front of the Telegraph office.
Wood can’t help himself. He is a human dog-fight.

THE MOST
WELCOME
PRESENT
OF ALL.
For a wedding: present no more magnificent or distinctive Gift could
be imagined than a STECK PIANOLA PIANO. When other gifts are
forgotten, or have become commonplace, it continues to give daily pleasure.
In many a home to-day it is the chief centre of entertainment and
recreation. Not only as a present to the bride, but as a wedding
anniversary gift from husband to wife, the PIANOLA PIANO is
deservedly a favorite.
The STECK PIANOLA PIANO is an upright piano of the
highest grade, and, in addition, contains within its case a complete
Themodist and Metrostyle Pianola, the only piano-playing device
endorsed by the greatest living musicians.
It can be played by the fingers on the keyboard in the usual way.
It can be played by means of a Pianola action within its case.
There is nothing to move up in front of the keyboard. To
change from hand-playing to Pianola-playing it is only necessary to
slide back a panel in the front of the case, and insert a perforated roll
of music.
We will take your old piano in part payment and allow you full
value for it.
A cordial invitation to call is extended to everyone who may be
interested in hearing the PIANOLA PIANO, irrespective of any
intention of purchase.
If unable to call, you should write for a catalogue. Simply write

The Tyre of
Never-Failing Excellence.
MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, November 23, 1908.
The tennis tournament trouble has Melbourne
in its grip—a sudden and unexpectedly severe
grip, like the hug of the bear which arrives when
no one dreams that he is about. Tennisites knew
that interest would be warm when the Davis Cup
was challenged here, and the club-in-chief at the
Warehousemen’s Grounds set to work to build a
grandstand of importance (the builders are still
tap-tapping away at it). But the tennisites see
in despair that it is about equal to holding the
average morning attendance that happens along
now, instead of giving room for the vast crowd
that will come for the international finals. Even
for the preliminaries and Inter-State Cross-Singles
and Something-or-other Doubles, the mighty and
big-hatted society crowd has rolled up in bat-
talions. Amphitheatre galleries of a sort have
been knocked up, but the grandstand cannot be
enlarged. The managers have built the new
court right in the corner of the grounds, and the
stand can only go back one way, as the club
house is on one side and the road fences in the
other. Yes, this meeting is a big thing, and it
will make the next year’s gathering bigger.
Tennis will absorb the glory that once came yearly
to the Austral Wheel Carnival.
The Dudleys and Carmichaels have added their
gubernatorial applause to that of the Cream.
The Dudleys go alone in a happy-family sort of
way. The girlish olive branches are dressed in
simple white frocks, without a semblance of differ-
ence in any detail of their plain gear, and they wear
big white hats of the school-girl type. Young hope-
ful, who is the image of his male progenitor, got a
good hard smack from the paternal hand last
week. The child, in wild excitement, picked up
a ball and returned it with vigor into the court.
At which disconcerting move champion Brookes
tried to grin happily, since the missile was
launched by the paw of so exalted an imp. For
even champion tennis players can be humbugs in
the bad old cause of social distinction. The
Countess goes along in her pretty white muslin
frocks, and peeps at the game from under a para-
sol, and the successful players bask in her con-
gratulations when they’re “out.”
The Carmichael refuses to maintain any guber-
natorial pomp, but wanders about in saggy,
loose ease, and picks up the stray balls for the
girl champions. Tennis is, a fine, brisk game to
watch, and it is no wonder that interest is reviv-
ing. It is so crisp and neat when first-class players
are on the job.
Beales Wright, one of the visiting Americans,
is a big, serious, solid athlete. Besides being a
tennisite, he is one of the best amateur pluggers
in America. He used to train with O’Brien. The
other Wooden Hamland man, Alexander, is small
and neat, with a thin face and a parrot chin and
nose that try to meet. He has the most telling
smile out of comic opera, and the biggest mouth
on record. When he sees a good hit that mouth
opens to smile, and then it becomes a firth or
estuary or a Hudson’s Bay.
The serious and sedate Honorable Kathleen,
sister and companion of the Maoriland Plunket
Governor, has bestowed the promise of her fair
hand upon Gentleman Help Lyon, who has fol-
lowed the fates of the House of Plunket for some
considerable time.
Since Fall-Off Brassey, Northcote was the first
Governor to show an intelligent interest in yacht-
ing ; but now the yachting crowd has a Governor
made to order. Dudley is a keen yachtsman and
has 23 first-prizes all in a row somewhere in the
land of Fog and Glory. The Yacht-clubbists at
St. Kilda opened the season on Saturday.
They gave Dudley a yachting cap with the
club colors, and let him be flag-captain on
Commodore Robb’s boat, the Savonara. Dudley
was having such a dandy time manoeuvring and
evoluting that it was all they could do to drag him
in for the speech-making and toasting. All the
clubs were out, fluttering about like so many
butterflies. The “ boys ” meanwhile had asked all
the Pretty Girl they knew and her Mama to watch
from the pier and have tea at the Club House.
At about five o’clock they all tumbled back,
sunburned and jolly, and made an enthusiastic
guard of honor to the advancing Sayonara party.
The little Countess went out with her captain-
husband, and turned up to tea in white serge,
with her hat at a highly unconventional angle,
her hair tossed, a blazing color in her cheeks,
and her cool, trim sedateness melted into the
breezy joyousness that is inevitable if one
fraternises with seafaring folk. The Dudley lady
won a race quite on her own in England. Her
Lord had entered for the race, but was away in
Sweden on the date. The Countess begged the
right to take the tiller, since the yacht was half
her own—and she won.
Dudley intends to build some sort of craft for
himself. His preference (so he speeched) was for
a one-design boat, as it made the sport keener and
eliminated the inevitable handicap that attaches
to the racing of boats of varied build. Since they
do not go in for one-design boats here in the clubs,
Dudley intends to have some old thing to trundle
along with.
The Club House had all its feathers preened for
the day. Bunting hung over the grey stone of the
balconies and verandahs, and an orchestra tooted
in the shrubbery. The ballroom had alluring
rows of cold bottles, and the space beyond was
marqueed in for tea and the fat strawberry that is
like unto the bibulist’s nose. Mrs. Bryant acted
as hostess-in-chief at the Club House, and
Commander Willie Robb, of the blue eyes, played
host on the bay.
Charlie Wallace evidently kept his Bona yacht
at home, for he haunted the pier and house all
day. Mrs. Beauchamp and daughter-in-law Mrs.
Charlie, in navy blue and a wild-rose hat, stayed
at the hostess post. The pretty Caulfield girls
were there with their vivid auburn hair. Madge
Mclntosh wore a wonderful lingerie gown
—the mummer lady has a mania for dress,
and never appears twice (off the stage) in the
same toggery. She and Miss Gunn have planted
themselves in a matchbox of a bijou villa in St.
Kilda; the dresses occupy five rooms and the
human occupants are allowed a couple of shelves
and the kitchen all to themselves. Mrs. Gaston
Mervale came also. She is a very pretty woman,
and she wore some sort of draperies and a blazing
ruby snake.
“ The Liars,” put on by amateurs at the Prin-
cess’s on Saturday afternoon, brought in a good
swag of the much-sought root for the Foundlings’
Hospital in East Melbourne. Not that anyone
ever said that money is the root of all evil, but
most people read the Bible’s ancient contributor
that way. The foundlings were pleased, and the
players were pleased, and the folk who packed the
house were pleased at the charitable glow they
felt all the time they watched their “naice”
friends pose so amiably stageward. There is no
place that suits a society woman like the amateur
stage for posing and frocking.
In “The Liars” O’Haras and Maddens pre-
dominated. Pretty little Nan O’Hara showed some
snap, and Mrs. Madden-Vallange was thoroughly
natural and convincing. Poor, long, lean hubby
Vallange missed his line at the beginning, and
nearly ran the flabbergasted show off its track—
but with his recovered balance, he gained a pass-
able pose.
Maddens, boxed in silk and feathery flutter,
and Mrs. Mummer Vallange’s two small boys
watched with bright eyes. Saturday was a day
of many outings, so the Governors and their ladies
were not enough to go round, but Lord Dicky
came and installed Mrs. Haw-Ruthven in a box,
with some pals. Then he scooted off to tennis or
somewhere.
The Dudleys were putting all their energies
into porting a hel-lum, or yelling nautical phrases
out on our Bay, where they were “opening the
season.” (Heaven only knows what would happen
to the season if it weren’t opened.) Mrs. Motor
Kelly queened it in cool white linen and an ivory-
tinted face. Mrs. L. L. Smith, with her £ £
Doctor, blazed in jewels and waving feathers. It
was a crushed house—a house in the very latest
toggery, with its hair done by a maid. Pretty
girls sold programmes and sweets. The last idea
of a charity matinee is to sell you your tickets for
afternoon tea in the auditorium, so that there is
no escape for the escort Man in an after rush and
crush.
The public, that strange and vacillating quan-
tity, rushed the usually despised Bijou on Satur-
day night for their old favorite, Thornton, in “The
Private Secretary.” The Bijou has lost its hold for
many a day—in spite of its new dress of blue
and mirror and marble. But Saturday brought
the bare shoulders and tasselled hair of
Sassiety, with its lawful wedded biled shirt-
front as escort, and Johnnydom hung over
the back of the circle and gaped in a hawty
manner at the surprising lack of room.
The boxes dazzled with pretty women, and the
Hearty Laugh got going among much sedateness.
Thornton is as telling as ever, but is unfortunate
in the Cattermole Uncle he at present possesses.
The Cattermole person is inclined to much overdo
his bluster.
Jack Murray’s eldest daughter, Doris, is taking
up chemistry as her hobby, and is to be appren-
ticed at the Queen Victoria Hospital for Women.
There she will have genial laboratory companions
in lawyer Sam Leon’s daughter and Miss Hope,
sister of Rita, the new pianist.
Dr. Walter Summons, who has just put up his
plate in Collins-street after doing a term at the
Austin Hospital, Heidelberg, is about to take the
matrimonial rails with the loveliest of she saw-
boneses. The beautiful bride-elect is Dr. Viva
Sproule, resident at the Queen Victoria Hospital.
She is tall and dark, with a glory of
beautiful hair and a complexion. The wedding
bells chime out before Christmas. Viva’s dad
comes of the squatting world, but drought fol-
lowed good clips, and then came the crash. Any-
how his bad luck gave the ’Varsity two brilliant
graduates, for another sister distinguished herself
in the science school, and has since married barris-
ter Derham, son of the Hon. Fred of that ilk.
Ercildoune homestead, near Ballarat, which
was leased last year to Melba, is again to
open up its doors, and dust itself, and be
gay. For the Wilsons, who own it, but
who domicile mostly in the Cold Country,
are due shortly on one of their usual
flying visits. These sturdy patriots approach
their native land and the family estate but once
every three years. On these occasions they im-
port with them a vast quantity of baggage,
furniture, and British serving man and
Continental serving maid. The estate which
provides the cash to pay the wages of the
above extends over 45.000 acres, though 10,000
acres of it were subdivided and sold lately.
It is not expected by those in the know that times
will be as merry with the Wilsons in residence as
they were when Mrs. Melba ran Ercildoune. Then
things fairly hummed. Boating, fishing, shooting
and motoring raged unceasingly. There was
enough fizzy wine permanently on tap to keep a
bookmakers’ club going for a week. The home-
stead rose garden, which is exquisite, was rifled
of its produce, and the house blazed with floral
color from scullery to bathroom. The head-
gardener has not got over the black horror of it all
yet. The Wilsons do things more quietly. They
are soldiers, by the way, and one of them married
Lady Sarah Churchill, a relation of Winston of
that ilk.
The Toorak Kirkby lady gave one of her de-
lightful entertainments to the flutterers last week.
She took over Princes Court bodily for an hour-
reserved it for her guests, who squealed on the
toboggans and splashed down the chute in wild
abandon until they were drafted off and driven
per infuriated motor to Ellesmere, the Kirkby
humpy. There the ballroom was in decorated
glory, with a band in possession, and the frivol
resolved itself into a jolly dance, with supper and
the garden as attendant joys. The youth of
Toorak and thereabouts are still talking of the
razzle.
Miss Rita Hope, a most charming little girl
who got into her first long frock to bow to a Mel-
bourne audience, gave a piano recital in the Town
Hall on Monday evening. The small lady has
been abroad studying under that great pianist
whose name is like a dog sneezing in the distance,
and has returned with a polish some thousand
candle-power brighter than that of the average
clever amateur. She is quite free from mannerisms,
and has warmth of temperament and feeling
beneath her very fine technique, though even now
she is only at the beginning of things. She looks
so young that the soft silk dress she wore had a
Dolly Varden plaving-at-being-grown-up sort of
look.
Miss Hope drew a bigger house than any of the
imported pianists have been favored with of late,
and the sounds of appreciation echoed strenuously
right back through the Town Hall. That
musical enthusiast. Dr. Eccles, was there
with his quiver-full of pretty girls, and the
magnificent Hogan dame, also hubby and
a big party. She was decked in the cloak that
was stolen from the Chinese Emperor—an emperor
who has been a longer time dead than the last
secretly guarded gentleman. The Pinschof ladies
were present, and a good deal of society south of
the Yarra seemed to have turned up in a motor
load of enthusiasm. Mama Hope sat anxiously
in the left balcony above her nervous child.
The concert was daintily and pleasantly
arranged. Hattenbach tremolo-ed on his ’cello in
accompaniment and in solo, and Miss Somerset
sang pleasingly. Mrs. Brookes, a Maorilander,
was a distinct surprise. One rarely gets such fine
voice production and vim in an amateur. A tall,
handsome Woman, she gave her platform manner
the ease and grace of one singing in her own
drawing-room. The lady studied for years under
Marchesi, with resultant culture and finish. One
of her encores was a Maoriland song written by
Maorilander Raven Hill. Kennerley Rumford
sang it in Melbourne with much snap on his return
from those islands. Mrs. Brookes interpreted it
quite differently, with due regard to the swinging
of that blob at the end of a string which keeps
time to the poi dance. Hers is a purely French
way of rendering it, and the effect, in a smaller
way, is as bright as anything that Blanche Arral
did.
The annual disporting of the infantile toe
trained in its pointing heavenward by Mrs. Green
and daughter Florrie, is to happen on Mon-
day, December 7, in Melbourne Town Hall.
Talking of Mrs. Green’s yearly ballet, it does
good work beyond teaching young muscles
how to twirl, for the gate money (a big sum) goes
to sundry charities, and the Infant Asylum gets
its share—its “whack,” in the language of the
back streets.
The girls of the coming Williamsonian panto,
are having much excitement. One of the big
scenes demands that the chorus shall con-
duct itself as vertically as possible on
skates. So far only about 2-| girls can manage to
leave the supporting rails Without strong male
assistance. The rest of that plump panto, does a
mild sort of cakewalk, and finally bumps pretty
solidly, even before the attendants have launched
them off the beach, as it were. Already one
charming demoiselle has had to retreat into
sanctuary on account of severe nether trouble.
“No waste, no want,” is the maxim of the day
at the Dudley residences. The household is to Vie
conducted on old English principles, and the chief
lady will check any discrepancies and count the
spoons, it is said. To be sure, this is a world
where a lot of discrepancies do want checking.
From “Rosna,” of Adelaide: —
Ada Orossley wasn’t allowed any breathing time in the
week we had her. Yet as we dragged her hither and
thither, she managed to show us some ravishing gowns.
All her concert frocks were of a directoire cut. One was
emerald green chiffon over silk, with silver passementerie
panelled down it; another was palest primrose satin, with
more silver. But the matinde frock was best of all—cream
wondrously embroidered with pink roses and jewelled
leaves. Lady Le Hunte and Miss Clowes were first-
nighters, and went behind afterwards to say that they
couldn’t have done it half as well themselves. The charming
songstress has a big asset in her remarkable memory; not
one of the hundreds of folk who met her casually five
years ago seems to have been forgotten. She sailed for
Westralia by the mailboat on Thursday with a big crowd
to throw sweet-scented vegetation at her ; and there’s
just a hope we shall capture her again on her way back.
The Lyric Club had an “original composition ” evening,
the other night, when all the noise was of South Australian
manufacture—any foreign noise was barred out, even
if it came in its best clothes and a “Merry Widow” hat.
There were five composers represented by 14 songs and
four piano soli, and the chief laurels were taken home in
a gradual tram by Dr. Harold Davies. Miss Angelita
Davies (who isn’t any relation of the other Orpheus) ran
a good second ; and other starters were Mrs. Whitcombe,
Messrs. Keg Bevan and Arthur Otto. Another young
local composer of considerable promise is Arthur Wil-
liamson ; but he’s a modest youth, who successfully
conceals his compositions under one of the forbidden
wheat bags, a bushel being insufficient for the purpose.
Next year, the Lyric committee intends to add original
drama evenings to the confusion.
The Robert Kyffin Thomases had an At Home in their
garden the other Saturday for the members of “ The
Observer Bookshelf,” a club which, under the leadership
of journalist Winifred Scott, guides the young idea in the
way it should read. Besides the members there came a
number of folk more or less interested. Miss Eileen
Anglin attended with the Evan Kyffin Thomases. The
Talbot Smiths were there; and a graceful Finlayson
maiden, and Misses Elsie Hamilton and Ethel Cooper
assisted the pretty Thomas daughters in distributing
ices and other literacy matter.
The “ Serena ” Trust, which same is manipulating the
career of Clara Kleinschmidt, invited the peerage to hear
the maiden’s wonderful voice at the Colton Hall the other
afternoon. There was a brief recital of simple English
songs, just to show those people who might be inclined
to “bear” shares in the Trust, the variety of gold-mine
that they will have to work against. Apart from her
wonder-notes, the maiden is tall and fair, and otherwise
well equipped to capture large audiences. Major Bass 6
made the traditional few remarks, and read part of a
letter from Ada Orossley, who advised that the young
singer should study for the concert platform, at the same
time making grand opera her goal.
Manager Portus, lion-tamer-in-chief to J. and N. Tait,
passed Westralia-wards last week, staying just long
enough to warn us that the Hambourg lion will roar in
three farewell performances shortly.
Norman Jolly, our first Rhodes scholar, has come
marching home again, with honors and degrees trailing
after him. For a year he has been in the Indian Forestry
Department; but he began to get anxious lest Australia
should cut down all its trees without his knowledge, so,
like a good Australian, he has brought his brains home to
offer them for use on behalf of his own country. He in-
tends to go to Victoria and N.S.W., look into forestry
matters, and perhaps settle in one or t’other of those
fortunate States.
We have our meetings in all sorts of quaint places.
Parliament and its wife and child were invited to go to
the Zoo, the other afternoon, “to meet his Excellency
the Governor.” Immediately afterwards, his Ex. set sail
up the Gulf bv way of retaliation.
Lord Dicky "Nevill dropped in here last week to see if we
could spare a shakedown in our hills during the summer
for the Governor-General. Lord Richard didn’t stay many
hours, but found time to fly up to the State-owned Marble
Hill, and view the flora and the drawing-room curtains
and the hat-stand and the umbrella-rack. Then he fled
back to report to his Ex. ; and Adelaide is breathlessly
awaiting developments.
The members of the Field Naturalists’ Society, who
are specially permitted to call all flora by its Latin name,
even if they haven’t been introduced, had a reception in
the Royal Society’s rooms, to celebrate the society’s 25th
birthdaj T . The Selways (he being chairman) hosted the
spree, and some time was occupied in appropriate
rhetoric. Then a new beast, called the episcope, was put
through its paces. It hurls phantom insects and vegeta-
tion about promiscuously, and can t»Qe a photograph of
you through 16 stone walls and an iron roof, and I’m not
sure it won’t turn into a camp oven, or a stretcher bed,
if there’s an extra rush of guests. Anyway, it’s very use-
ful. A festive little supper provided a cheerful interrup-
tion, and the rest of the evening was spent meandering
among High Art in the Federal Exhibition.
Talking of that Exhibition reminds me that another of
Lionel Lindsay’s little etchings has been purchased by a
damsel of taste, pianist Ethel Cooper. Her chum, fiddler
Nora Kyffin Thomas, bought one also.
Yours affectionately,
J OHANNA.
The present Freetrade British Govern-
ment recently put a highly-protective Patents
Act on the Statute Book. The accursed Protec-
tionism is already roosting on the fence in the
most baneful fashion. This is from London
Times (28/8/08)
The operation of the new Patents Act is mainly, if not
wholly, responsible for the arrangements which are now
in progress at certain premises at Brimsdown, a village
just north of Ponder’s-end, on the borders of Middlesex
and Essex, known as the Imperial Works.
A German firm has just acquired the land and buildings,
which have a total area of approximately four acres, on
lease with option to purchase, and it is expending a sum of
about £3OOO on structural work necessary to adapt the
place to its requirements as a manufactory of the Tung-
sten filament incandescent electric lamps associated with
the names of Messrs. Julius Pintsch and Dr. Kuzel. These
works will be utilised for supplying the United Kingdom
and the colonies, factories for the supply of Germany,
Austria, Sweden, and Prance already existing in those
countries.
The firm intends to employ 400 or 500 hands, mostly
girls. With the exception of the chemist in charge, ail
the persons employed will be drawn from the district.
The girls’ wages will average from 10s. to £1 per week,
according to experience, and the men will be paid 9d.
per hour.
The trouble is that a mere Patents Act only pro-
tects a handful of industries, but, all the same, it
is a beginning.

A cry of distress from San Francisco :
Listen to this wail of woe, about dragging “ our great
natural resources ”to the other end of nowhere. A fine
vessel, Australian owned or chartered, took a cargo of
3000 tons coal to San Francisco at 5 dollars per ton freight.
The Murikan boom burst, the consignees were not to be
found, and the United States marshal ordered the cargo
to be sold by public auction for freight. Then tfie
gentle methods of the Yankee Goal Trust and its agents
heo’an. They don’t admit they are a Trust; nevertheless,
with coal selling at from 10 to 16 dollars per ton, all
the marshal got was s2‘Bsc. The Australian shippers,
I’ve heard, are insolvent. The Australian owner lost his.
ship, since, as he got little or no freight, he couldn’t meet
his debts. And the Australian skipper and his crew
(which, strange to relate, consists nearly all of young
white Australians) are fighting’ like all to get theii
wa°-es. And. all to benefit the Yankee sharks.

The sky-high price to which township lands
have been boomed in view of the North Coast (N.S.VV.)
railway construction recalls the tremendous splash that
was made when the line was being built to Newcastle.
At that time several sales took place of town lots, and the
towns are still unborn. The plans were adorned
with water frontages, with jetties reaching to deep
water, poppet-heads going skywards to indicate
the coal development, and big business places which
would have done credit to Newcastle itself. To-day,
groping through the scrub, you can still stub your toe
against the pegs of the towns that never existed except
on the wily subdivisionists’ plans. *
A Melbourne man lately struck what looked
like a new swindle. He sent his youngster to the
butcher’s for a piece of pickled pork, and the infant
brought back something that weighed 2:jib. The some-
thing was placed in a dish to be cooked next day, but
when the housewife started operations she found l s lb. of
pickled pig and a quantity of brine. As the citizen had
paid Bd. a pound for this brine he was much annoyed,
and interviewed the butcher, who, after much argument,
returned the lOd. represented by the brine. This caper
being brought under the notice of the-Victorian meat ex-
pert Dr. Brown, he explained that the up-to-date butcher
didn’t “ corn ” his beef, pork, etc., in the old-fashioned
style, but pumped brine into it with a force-pump. The
chief advantage of this plan was that it enabled the
butcher to supply any quantity of corned beef at a few
minutes’ notice ; the fact that the force-pump expanded
31b. of meat into about 51b. was a mere detail and a by-
product of the butchering business, so to speak. Of
course the brine drains out of the meat after a time, but
the trouble is that the butcher won’t give it time—not if
he knows it.

A TJ.S. scientist, who enjoys remarkably good
health, attributes it to the free use of pineapple juice.
He says he considers pineapple juice “ the grandest tome
that Nature has yet offered to man, and even better as a
weapon against old age and decrepitude than the soui
milk diet that has made the Bulgarian peasants the
lon<>’est-lived people on the face of the earth.” The
Bulletin regards life with a certain amount of affection,
but it refuses to absorb sour milk for weary, bitter years,
in the hope of living to a curdled old age. Bulgaria is the
home of the massacre and the atrocity, and this paper is
now firmly convinced that it is the sour milk that is
responsible. *
“ Nationalist ” : Apparently Victoria hasn’t got
a Truck Act; anyway, 1 find that in Gippsland numerous
sawmills run their own “general stores ” for the con-
venience ” of the timber-cutters. What the prices are
like can be judged by the fact that people who are not on
the mills’ pay-sheets can get goods from the stores at
much less than the mill employees have to pay for tnem.
Of course, the men—married preferred ; they want more
stores—can go elsewhere for their jam and slop-clothes.
Bub if they do—well, what do you* think ? *
Practically all the arrowroot swallowed in Aus-
tralia comes from a dozen or so farms in the Logan and
Albert, districts (Q.), which yield about 270 tons a year.
The average price on the spot is about £l5 per ton, thougn
lately, owing to a demand for arrowroot as a substitute
for starch in some kinds of laundry-work, the price went
up to £2O. Queensland arrowroot comes from the bulb
of Carina edulis , and is known as purple arrowroot,
while Bermuda and Mauritius arrowroots—the kinds
John Bull chiefly uses —are the products of Maranta
arundinacea, and are called white arrowroot. Chemical
analysis shows very little difference between the two.
What difference does exist is in the fibre, and here the
advantage is with the purple variety. The bulbs are sown
in showery weather towards the end of the year, and
reach maturity in from six to eight months, blight
withering of the foliage by frost is beneficial, as it drives
the starch into the bulb. The tops are then cut off, and
the bulbs, which resemble potatoes but are slightly
larger, are dug up. The process of manufacture occupies
only 24 hours. Immense quantities of water are used in
the operation, a ton of arrowroot requiring about 50,0 W
gallons. Nothing goes to waste, as the refuse, fibre and
pulp are taken back to the fields, and manure the land lor
the next crop of baby-food.
THE HAPPY DAYS OF YORE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
But if Australia to-day be compared with Australia ten
or twenty years ago, it will be found that there h
been retrogression, Whereas, then, there was a distinct
temptation for investors to place their 'oOT'ey
cause by so doing they got a considerably higher rate of
'interest than it las possible for them to secure in older
countries, now the rate obtainable in Australia is no
better than that in England, and much less than that 1
the United States or Germany. The result is tbat mie /
our great advantages has been taken away from us, , and
we have now to compete with other countries on more
even terms. — S. M. Ilerald.
Twenty years ago
■ Things were not so slow —
Not so miserably mean—
Cohen had a show ;
The Herald tells us so.
And granny ought to know ;
We used to pay more interest
Twenty years ago !
Oli, those happy years !
(Fled, as it appears)
When all foreign capital
Was received with cheers —
Promptly “ blewed ” in beers —
A railway line or so,
“ Perks’’and “reproductive works,”
Twenty years ago !
A million pounds or two
Borrowed from the Jew
Filled with pride the countryside
When they rushed it through ;
Now the loan is due
And our funds are low,
The dear old game don’t look the same
As twenty years ago ;
In those blessed days
Money they could raise
(Yea, and did !) from Moses Yid—
Now Pilgarlie pays !
They were quite content
To part up five per cent.
(I should reckon so !)
Why ? The blessed loan was spent
Twenty years ago!
Now the Herald moans
We pay less for loans —
Don’t enthuse on I 0 U’s
Given by Brown or Jones,
Now in Heaven (we hope),
So our record’s low,
We’ve lost the great advantages—
The monumental privileges—
Of twenty years ago !

m erit alone gained for the Beale Australian Pianos the highest prizes
awarded at the Franco-British Exhibition. It is the practice of foreign
piano-makers, when showing at an exhibition, to prepare highly ornate, specially-
designed instruments; but when we decided to send a few Beale A ustralian
Pianos to the Branco-British Exhibition we had no time specially to prepare any
instruments, even if we had wanted to do so. So we just took ten of our
ordinary models out of stock, packed them with the care with which we always
pack our pianos when sending them out, and sent them to London. IVe had never
before publicly shown our instruments in Europe, and the judges had never hitherto
met with them. Yet our Pianos secured the Grand Prix (the highest possible
award) “for tonal qualities and general excellencej gold medal “for perfection
of woodworkj and gold medal for inventions. The jury consisted of three French
and two British experts, and their judgment was unanimous. This triumph for
Australian industry zvas preceded by another striking evidence of the high quality
of the Beale Pianos. Messrs. Lyons & Co., proprietors of the Strand Palace
Hotel, now being erected on the site of the old Exeter Hall, London, after careful
examination and testing of our instruments at the Exhibition, ordered no less
than twenty.
In view of these facts, if you intend purchasing a piano, it would be to your
interest to call at our Showrooms and inspect the Beale Australian Pianos .
Over eleven thousand have been sold in every part of Australia, and in New
Zealand\ Fiji, Samoa, New Caledonia, Mauritius, India and Norfolk Island.
We have hundreds of testimonials from buyers in all walks of life. Our
catalogue and copies of testimonials will be sent free on request.

KIDNEY AND BLADDER TROUBLES.
Mr. Duncan McKellar, of 91 Princes Street,
Sydney, who contracted a cold in the kidneys,
tells in the following letter how he suffered with
aching back and bladder troubles from which he
could gain but little relief until he commenced
taking Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. As a veri-
fication of his statement he sends his photograph
for publication.
Mr. Duncan McKellar-
(From a photo.)
“I have much pleasure,”
he writes, ‘ ‘ in testifying to
the worth of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills. Some
months ago I contracted a
cold in the kidneys, and
bladder trouble followed.
For some weeks I suffered
agony at times, piercing
pains in the back and burn-
ing sensations at the base
of the abdomen, which only
hot fomentations relieved.
I was under various treat-
ments, but nothing gave me
so much ease as Dr. Morse s
Indian Root Pills, which I
took regularly for some
weeks, until all symptoms seemed to have disap-
peared. I have since continued their use, taking
three pills occasionally, and I can assure you that
I am almost free from my complaint. At the
first indication of any return I take a dose imme-
diately, and it is thus warded off. Undoubtedly
your pills are an excellent medicineboth for children
and adults, being mild in their action and effectual
as a corrective of all common family ailments.
My wife and children take them occasionally, and
we always keep a bottle in the house, and recom-
mend them to everyone.”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a perfect
blood purifier, and a positive remedy for bilious-
ness, indigestion, constipation, headaches, sallow
complexion, liver and kidney troubles, piles,
pimples and blotches, and for female ailments.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The verdict of the Whelch-Thoroughgood con-
test is that the good little man is not in the same street
as the good big man—in a sculling match. Thoroughgood
went to the front at the first and stayed there right
through. Whelch pulled a game race and made desperate
efforts, but he had never a chance, and was beaten com-
fortably bv three lengths. The only man who had any
praise for Whelch was his opponent, who declared him to
be the best man he (the champion) had ever rowed. The
sustained spurt with which Whelch finished was a sur-
prise to most of the people who watched the race, hut it
is said by experts on the spot that at no time had Whelch
any chance. Thoroughgood held him every inch of the
way. The race was for the championship of Australia and
a stake of £2OO, of which Whelch receives £5O for ex-
penses. Owing to the folly which fixed the scene on the
Hunger River, the gate amounted to only a beggarly £75.
Altogether the match was a dreary business.
The day was unfortunate, for rain came down
heavily. According to some accounts the race was pulled
in the teeth of a flood tide, while others say it was
practically dead water between the tides. Anyhow,
something got in the road, as the winner’s time
(20min. 35sec.) was the slowest for years. It was 2min.
15sec. worse than the time in Fogwell’s deplorable effort,
so apparently the champion was never really extended,
and his remarks about being nearly done, and all out and
so forth are generally regarded as merely a generous
eulogy of his rival's efforts. Now that Whelch has
vanished, and there are no more local men to conquer,
Thoroughgood begins to cast a hungry eye in the direc-
tion of Wanganui River, in Maoriland, and to think of
things—big things.
* * * *
Webb’s ill-advised conduct in fooling round
with rockets on King’s Birthday has interfered with his
training. All the flesh between two of his right hand
fingers was burned or blown away, and the nerves were
somewhat injured. .Under these circumstances rowing
exercise, in the real sense of the term, is impossible. So
the champion is making up by taking unusually long
walks and runs. His rambles were very extended before.
Heaven only knows what they are now.
* * * *
As far as can be judged there is mighty little
difference between Arnst and Webb. The former has the
advantage of considerably deeper chest development, and
therefore has probably the greater lung' power. Webb
counters this by developing and exercising his bellows on
scientific principles. Just now columns are being written
about both men, but when the matter is boiled down, the
race on December 15 is going to be a case of the survival
of the more durable. Come to think of it most races are !
* * » *
“ Wonder of wonders ! ” said the sailors, as the
Eileen, skippered by W. Read, went dancing home first
in the Sydney Flying Squadron’s Inter-State test race for
the 18ft. championship. That the mighty Chris. Webb
and the wonderful Australian should be beaten at all in
a championship struggle took away the breath of the
multitude ; but when the skiff Oweenee, a mere speck in
comparison, cut the Australian down for second place,
the multitude wondered if anything had gone wrong with
its eyesight. Each man turned, looked at his neighbor
and asked furtively, “Did you see anything unusual?”
But it was a fact—the Australian was third in the cham-
pionship race, and skipper Read, back from a long illness,
had signalised his return with the victory of his life.

The fact that the Yankees have held the British
International Cup for two years is beginning to get on
the nerves of English motor boatmen, and a determined
effort is to be made to recover the thing next season.
Lord Howard de Walden, now that he has finished fight-
ing Australian claimants for his heritage, will take a
hand, and so will the Duke of Westminster, while
S. F. Edge, the ex-Sydney man who now runs the far-
famed Napier Co., has announced that his co. will build a
special boat for the job. The Yankees are said to be
seriously alarmed.

The young men and maidens —also the old—
who understand the whole art and mystery of the game
of “smash,” “half-volley,” “vantage,” “ deuce,” and so
forth have been working themselves into a great state of
excitement in Melbourne these latter days during the
preliminaries for the single, double, and mixed lawn
tennis championships. Saturday enticed a 2000 crowd
out to view a practical rehearsal of the Davis Cup con-
test—the meeting of Brookes and Wilding and Wright
and Alexander in the Men’s Doubles final. The little
Warehousemen’s Cricket Ground on the St. Kilda-road,
having been acquired by the M.0.C., and leased or handed
over or something to the L. T. Association, has been laid
out in one “special international” court and 15 other
courts, eight of which are in use at present, though,
like Bent’s policy, they have been published before they
are ready, and some.have had to be withdrawn. Still,
the aggregate grounds, club house, stands, etc., will
make a gorgeous outfit when completed ; whether they
will pav is quite another story. Certainly the “ special ”
court won’t provide the accommodation that will be
needed for the Davis Cup—even at 7s. 6d., 55., and
2s. 6d. per head—but then a Davis Cup doesn’t
occur every day. Saturday’s collision . between the
American and Australasian champions was a joyous cir-
cumstance, and though the average tennis game is a
weariful episode this match held the spectators spell-
bound. The 90 minutes’ play seemed all too short.
Brookes and Wilding were, of course, old friends;
Alexander is a lean, hawk-like youth, while his mate,
Wright, inclines to a Jewish cast of countenance and is
slightly remindful of Tommy Burns, though a trifle taller.
If Saturday’s play be a criterion, the Davis Cup will stay
in Australia ; for though the games were closely contested,
the Australians more than held their own. Especially
were they superior in serving, Brookes frequently sending
in a bali that just escaped being a “fault’’and barely
rose a foot from the ground. Also their tactics showed
more thought, the Americans often using a straight-down
“ smash ” when a long, low drive would have paid better.
B. and W. won the first two sets by 6-3 and 6-2 ; then the
Americans woke up and scored with 6-4 ; but it was only a
flutter, the Australasians winning the next set by 6-2, and
with it the rubber and the Doubles Championship.
After this champagne, the lemonade of the
Ladies’ Single Championship, between Misses Addison and
Gyton, seemed insipid. There was practically no volley-
ing, little “smashing,” and the placing seemed mostly
accidental. Yet the contestants were so evenly matched
that the first set ran up to “ nine all ” before Miss Addison
collared the necessary two games. She won the
next set, and with 'it the championship, more
easily, by 6-4. Miss Gyton had all the sympathy
of the crowd, being a cheerful little mite, with
a passionate squeal, that broke out whenever
a ball went where she didn’t intend it. The
average tennis girl is a serious-minded damsel of a ruddy
countenance; also she doesn’t run to flesh, like the
surfing girl, wherefore the pleasing rotundity of little
Miss Gyton and her joyous squeak served to lighten the
prevailing gloom. Earlier in the afternoon Miss Addison
had helped Doust (N.S.W.) to collar the Mixed Doubles
Championship for the second year in succession, by win-
ning two sets from Miss Baker and Parker (N.S.W.) —4-6,
6-4, 6-2.
* * * *
Horace Rice, who captained N.S.W. v. Victoria
at inter-State law'n tennis last week, has a record which
will stand a deal of rubbing out. Rice has played in 21
matches out of 42 against Victoria ; and on this season’s
form is good enough for a good many games yet. It was
bad luck for him that an injured ankle put him out of the
tourney and denied him a whack at the Americans.
* * * *
Saturday in Sydney was an unpleasant day for
cricket, the weather being showery. On Sydney Cricket
Ground play was suspended several times, but on other
grounds the players did not stand so much upon the order
of their plugging, but just plugged through regardless of
falling rain. Two centuries were scored, Hopkins, of
North Shore, carrying his bat for 113, and Barnes, of Red-
fern, making 107 before being caught by Bowden off his
own ball. Syd Gregory, of Waverley, had a streak of
bad luck in being bowled at 95. Austin Diamond, of Bur-
wood, accounted for 76, and E. Bull, of Middle Harbor,
for 75. In spite of the greasiness of the ball some of the
bowlers had a pleasant time. Willoeks, of University,
took six Middle Harbor wickets for 14 runs ; Whitting, of
Balmain, got four Sydney sticks for 21; Gee, of Middle
Harbour, blew’ out the candle of five University men for
56 runs ; and Whiddon, of the same club, took the other
five Uni. sticks for 76. After that the record tapered off
to Cotter’s two for 73 and Noble’s none for 61.
Of all the disgraceful dog-wallopings ever
sustained by a first-grade team, that of Paddington by
North Sydney takes the edible substance. The previous
Saturday saw Paddington dismissed for 150, of which
Noble made none and Trumper 45. North Sydney then
got to work and piled up 130 for the loss of two wickets.
On Saturday last it increased the runs to 208 without
losing an} 7 more wickets, and thus w’on by eight
wickets and 58 runs on the first innings. Most of the
afternoon v'as spent in the pavilion, watching the occa-
sional raindrops. Both teams are understood to be very
susceptible, to cold, neuritis, muscular rheumatism, and
other disorders easily affected by wet weather. Gordon’s
attack on Burwood was successful by 84 runs in the first
innings ; and Waverley squelched the baby club of Peter-
sham in a brutal manner, the figures being four wickets
and 51 runs on the first innings. Glebe, although top
dog, only beat. Redfern by 35 on the first innings. Rain
stopped the play between Middle Harbor and University,
and the unfinished thing was in favor of Middle
Harbor, by 58 runs on the first innings. The Balmain
smashing of Sydney was a glorious business—but for the
fact that the smashee was Sydney, which practically de-
prived the w'in of all its glory. Balmain declared with
five wickets down for 325 runs, and Sydney heaped up
153 in the first pitiable effort to get level. Following on,
the metropolis made 39 for no wickets, so the game ended
in a w'in for Balmain by 172 on the first innings. The
result of the upheaval is to leave Glebe still at
the head of affairs with 10 competition points. Far
behind—hull down on the horizon, in fact—Central
Cumberland has five competition points, Waverley four,
University, North Sydney, Balmain and Middle Harbor
two each.' After that Petersham, Redfern and Gordon
are two less than nothing; Noble’s motley crowd, Pad-
dington, is three below zero ; Burw’ood, once mighty, but
now dead meat, is four below the sign of the fowl; and
Sydney is at the unutterable depth of six less than nil.

Rain on the Friday made last Saturday a bow-
ler’s day in Melbourne pennant cricket, though East
Melbourne certainly finished up with 128 for two
wickets against St. Hilda’s 141. Other performances with
the timber were dismal. Melbourne, which made the
bloomer of sending North in on a going-to-the-devil
wicket, could only respond with 60 for nine against
North’s 102, so it seems likely to lose on the first innings.
Carlton sent its opponents (P’ran) in, and had prac-
tically a similar experience; the P’ranites walloped
up 157 for eight wickets (declared closed), and rocked
down five of Carlton’s for 43 by the time
the clock clanged six. Fitzroy’s 128 against
South was an elephantine effort considering the condi-
tions, and the Skinnerites have so far licked up some of
the deficit with five for 64. Richmond, with six for 81
against Collingwood’s 102, is within reach of victory on
the first hits. Northcote won right out by making 110,
and by dismissing the enemy (Essendon) for 65. Chief
bowling performers for the day were Laver (eight for 53
for East Melbourne), Hart (six for 25 for North), and
Vernon and O’Leary (each six for 32 for South and North-
cote respectively).

Victoria is believed to have another Blackham
coming along in the tall, thin form of young Albert
Lampard, who has made his mark with Richmond this
season. Lampard is a good, improving bat, and more
than a merely good wicketkeeper. , Playing for Hawthorn
(2nd grade) two seasons ago, he had a batting average of
22 and a record of 35 stumped arid 17 caught behind the
sticks. Last season, when Hawthorn won the Pennant,
their young hopeful stumped and caught 27 of the enemy,
and averaged 31 with the bat. Some of Lampard’s work
has been enthused over by veterans who remember Black-
ham at his best. If he is not selected for Victoria in the
next inter-State match the omission will be something of
a surprise.

Finding that no better terms could be extracted
from the Sydney Cricket Ground Trustees, the N.S.W.
Cricket Association last week accepted the cheque for
£5OO and a reduction of the ground charges from 15 per
cent, to 10 per cent, during the coming season. The
N.S.W. Cricket Association is so ill off financially that
there was no alternative; and the C.A. pockets, for a
little while longer, its challenge to test the trustees’
right to grab nearly all the proceeds of the pastime, while
it has to accept the crumbs that drop from the table by
accident.
* * * *
N.S.W. schoolboy E. P. Barbour continues on
his merry way in the cricket field. On Saturday, against
St. Tgnatius in the Great Public Schools championship,
Barbour scored 132, and also took five wickets for 42
runs.

The latest victim of the relay ride disease is the
Dunlop Rubber 00.. which threatens to organise a bike
relay ride from Adelaide to Sydney. Whatever the
Dunlop Co. does it does in a big way, and its relay ride
will be on the usual scale. The sections will be 20 or 25
miles in length, and each negotiated by two wheelers.
The principal difficulty is to arrange relays across the
Ninety-Mile desert on the South Australian section, but
no doubt the strenuous co. will find a way out. If the
ride is held, it will probably eventuate about next Easter,
when the weather is cool and the moon full. The latter
is necessary for obvious reasons! The total distance is
1122 miles, and to carry out such a huge undertaking the
assistance of cycle riders and traders along the whole
route will be necessary. And, as a rule, cycle traders are
not very enterprising.
* ♦ * *
Major Taylor’s demand for £l5OO appearance
money for all Australia knocked endways the Sydney
syndicate which contemplated a track cycling revival,
and it went to the trouble and expense of cabling a firm
refusal. But it seems that there is a Melbourne syndicate
which is determined to have Taylor at all costs ; it means
to bring about a track bike revival during 1909, and
Tavlor is its reviver. If Taylor comes to Melbourne he
wiil probably find himself sublet to the Sydney syndicate,
or the Melbourne crowd may undertake the task of a
double revival. In which case, the Lord have mercy on
the Melbourne syndicate.
Cyclist F. S. Hagney will now apply for per-
mission to include Jonah among his front names. Three
times within the month has he broken his collarbone, and
on the last occasion there wasn’t a bike in sight. He was
proceeding along the footpath in the usual way, tripped,
fell, and when he got up, the sting of pain told him that
he had got the old complaint. Hagney is now the holder
of a world’s record that is not likely to be challenged.

Ivy Evans, the Australian lady champion
athlete, continues to unfold shapely limbs to interested
sportsmen. At Perth (W.A.) the championess defeated
Ethel Page rather easily over a 50yds. course in 6 4-ssec.
—which is alleged to be the world’s record for a lady at
the distance. The defeated sprinteress was adorned in a
short skirt, but I. Evans sped along in the orthodox
knickers, and thereby reaped a big advantage.

A couple of schoolboys were responsible for
commendable athletic deeds at Ballarat (Vic.) school
championships. J. Blake (brother to “Jim” Blake,
possibly the finest amateur athlete ever seen in Victoria)
bounded over sft. 2in. in a high jump, 21ft. 3in. in a long
jump, and heaved the shot 29ft. SJin. ; while L. D.
Meyer gathered in the 100yds. (llsec.) and 440yds.
(53 l-ssec.), and cleared 19ft. 6in. in the broad jump.
These boys are more than likely to do something before
very long. # #
J. J. Giltinan, manager of the “Kangaroo”
team of footballers in England, is blowing a long trumpet
in his wanderings. In a recent interview, Giltinan
alleged that in three years the only Rugby game in Aus-
tralia and Maoriland would be the Northern Union
variety. No doubt Giltinan is a prophet; but unless
there is more public interest in the Northern Union game
in N.S.W. than hung around it last season, appearances
indicate that the N.U. will need to visit the undertaker.
At any rate, there is nothing to indicate the demise of
the Rugby Union—despite what Mr. Giltinan may allege
to the contrary.

The bowling fraternity in Sydney is in a state
of dazed wonderment, for the N.S.W. Association has at
last won a game, downing the Northern Association by
151 to 133. The amazing event took place on the North
Sydney Club’s green, where the metropolitan crowd won
four out of six rinks. Play was much interfered with by
the continual showers, and the risks of catching cold and
rheumatism taken by the desperate players were shudder-
some. But when victory smiled on them the city men
felt that they had not risked their lives in vain.

A weird figure, clad in a loin cloth and one or
two other garments of like size, suddenly appeared in
Melbourne’s highway on a recent Monday afternoon. As
he fled along the tram track in perspiring haste a vague
feeling of anxiety pervaded the collective breast of the
crowd in the street. There was something that might
have been a bomb gleaming in his right hand, and be was
making straight for the Town Hall with a desperate light
in his eyes. Two troopers whom he had evidently routed
in single combat, were galloping in front at a feverish
bat, ever and anon casting apprehensive glances over
their shoulders as the wild bathing-costume man gained
perceptibly on them. What was to be done? There was
terror on every countenance, and nobody breathed for
10 minutes. Then the tension broke as it became known
that the apparition was quite harmless. Anon it was
learned that he was the last member of the Relay Race,
which brought the good news from Geelong to Melbourne
that the Mayor of one place had sent his compliments to
the Mayor of the other. The announcement of this
doughty deed caused a mighty cheer to rend its way from
every throat. At least, if it didn’t it should have. Then
excitement died down, and the running bather retired
somewhere to put on his clothes.

The “Marathon” race (Windsor to the
Stadium, London) was run again by 89 professionals last
month. They had better weather than Dorando had in
July, and the first seven all improved on his time. An
Irishman and a Londoner raced each other for the first
20 miles ; then Siret, a Frenchman, came out compara-
tively fresh, and won by nearly half-a-mile. Time,
2hr. 37min. 23sec. (Dorando’s time was 2hr. 54min.
48 and two-fifths seconds.)

lolaire, the most popular performer on the Vic.
turf, has been bought for India. To be a good, trust-
worthy racehorse in Australia is to be doomed to exile,
seeminglv. lolaire, the big son of Scotch Mary, is one of
the best. He isn’t as good a stayer as his larruping half-
brother, Great Scot, who went to India five years ago,
but in gameness he’s the better of the two. Out of 44
races, lolaire scored 20 firsts or seconds, and was un-
placed only 18 times. This season he ran third for the
Epsom at Randwick, and for the Eclipse Stakes and Oup
at Caulfield. At the recent V.R.C. meeting he won two
handicaps carrying top weight, and ran second to Pink
’Un for the Linlithgow Stakes. After which he won the
Williamstown Cupi In most of his races he took the lead
at the outset and kept it nearly all the way, as at Caul-
field recently, when only a slight want of condition pre-
vented him from running away with the Cup. lolaire
was not always handy at the finish, like Poseidon and
Mooltan, but he always gave his backers a more or less
exciting run for their money. His reward will be a hor-
ribly unpleasant sea voyage and a d d uncomfortable
climate at the end of it.

Queensland Turf Club at its three days’
November meeting paid away £3695 in prize money; and
34 owners got a cut. H. V. Hewitt took the biggest
piece, £762. No other owner got as much as £5OO. The
best nag at the meeting was the three-year-old Flaxen,
owned by Hewitt aforesaid, who won the Derby and
King’s Cup (w.f.a.)and ran second in the Queensland
Cup. In the Derby he clipped 2sec. off the previous best
time (2min. 39sec.) for that race. The best two-year-old
was Mischief, who, although beaten at even weights by
Mcllwraith—what a name for a horse !—in the Hopeful
Stakes through the over-confidence of his jockey, won the
Nursery Handicap and the Two-Year-Old Handicap with
ridiculous ease, giving Mcllwraith 51b. and a beating of
many lengths in the latter race. The most successful
riders were M. J. Hayes, D. Callinan and A. Wood, with
three wins each.

Boobing of seats for the Burns-Johnson dis-
agreement opened on Monday last at Mick Simmons’
depSt, King-street, Sydney, and by 2 p.m. £1074 worth
of sitting room had been sold. So far, the bulk of
Sydney’s demand has been for the lower-priced seats,
but the £4OO from Melbourne mostly represented £1
and £2 allotments. To guard against forgeries, tickets
will be issued only at 119 King-street, and any tickets
offered elsewhere can be rejected with kicks. At the
Burns-Squires tussle the management recognised some
of the tickets as forgeries, but allowed the bearers to
enter rather than provoke a riot around the gates.
But on the Burns-Johnson occasion any unauthorised
tickets will be treated with scorn at the portal, so in-
tending patrons are warned against dealing with
unauthorised vendors.
On the latest inspection, Mr. Johnson, cancn-
date for the heavyweight bruising championship of the
world, was discovered perspiring profusely and beam-
ing brilliantly after a series of three-round bouts witn
his trainers and the best the local field could produce.
He seems to like visitors, and, with a proper apprecia-
tion of his important position, always makes a P Ol " 1 ?*
issuing a bulletin to the press of the world and his
friends in Amurka. This is his latest, and foreign
papers, especially the Amurkan ones, will please copy:
“ You may sav to the press an’ me friends in Amurka
that I will enter the ring on the 26th of December
feeling ready to undertake the contest of my life. 1
have had ample facilities for training, and the best of
treatment accorded to me by Mr. Mclntosh, the
promoter for the syndicate. I don’t wish to
boast” (modesty of a kind is Johnsons strong
point), “but if my present feelings are any in-
dication, I think you can announce to James J.
Jeffries that he better get ready to come out of retire-
ment. Mrs. Johnson is enjoying the best of health an l
am learning to hit like the native kangaroo kicks ! It is
this entire absence of the Yankee proclivity to nute
that makes Mr. Johnson so deservedly popular. But in
spite of the heaps of modest information that the dark
man discharges at the press and public he finds time to
do some tremendously long walks. He is training at
Botanv, and his jaunts include runs through National
Park, which make his average daily itinerary something
like 20 miles, besides the usual sparring and other ex-
ercises. The result is that he is only about four pounds
above his fighting weight at the present time, and the
immediate future will see an easing off of the strenuous
training work.
• • * •
Burns, Esq., is still at Medlow Hydromajestic,
among the Blue Mountains, and has astonished the visi-
tors to that luxurious resort, where more people are
killed through over-feeding than are cured by other
means, by training largely on an empty bingy. He
doesn’t take such lengthy excursions as Johnson, but the
country he takes them over is something fearful to even
look at, and the effect is to so accustom him to the dread-
ful that even should Johnson make faces at him during
the scrap it will have no effect on him. A curious thing
is that the Mclntosh has been overwhelmed by abusive
letters from both sexes for having sent Burns so far away
to train. The writers want to look at him, and they
demand that something be done. So, to save his head,
the Mclntosh has decided that in future, on Wednes-
day and Saturday afternoons, Burns shall be on
view at the Stadium, Sydney. In any case, Burns will do
bis last fortnight's training in the city, so that the change
of atmosphere shall not have a deleterious effect on him
during the disturbance on the morning of Boxing Day.

Jim Griffin, the list. 9-pounder, showed more
pluck than discretion in hurling himself at Bill Lang in
Melbourne Cvclorama the other Monday. The battle was
for £250 and the Australian championship, the latter
retainable till Squires renews his claim. Lang was some-
thing over 13st., and the first two rounds were suggestive
of the rash efforts of a fox terrier to devour a mastiff.
During those rounds Griffin’s vim and the ardor of his
punch enabled him to give Bill a disagreeable appear-
ance, but William was never seriously disordered. He
watched for openings while Griffin whirled, and when Bill
found his opening Jim sat down hard. In the last two
rounds Griffin was so distressed that he couldn’t keep his
legs, but it didn’t dawn on him that it wasn't worth
while to continue getting up merely to have a large,
angry man knock him down again, so a superior police-
men in a gilt cap stilled the contending elements. Lang
was the winner in five rounds. ,

Some time ago the automobilist was charged
with slowly destroying the orchards, hedges, shrubs and
other beauties along the roads of England. Also it was
said that, owing to “motor-stink,” houses near roads
much frequented by automobilists were practically un-
lettable. The smell was bad, but the -Just was death and
eternal destruction ; and there was talk of leagues of
property-owners to shoot motorists at sisrht. The otnei
dav it was discovered that since automobiles have become
so popular in London the death-rate has declined 1 *
and the motorist calmly stepped in and claimed the
credit. “ Motor-stink,” he said, was the finest disinfectant
in existence, and slaughtered the destructive germs of a
great city by thousands of billions or trillions. The rest
of the community is at present too staggered to make any
suitable reply.

HONOUR WHERE HONOUR IS DUE.
Whatever promotes the well-being: of humanity in an eminent degree is sure of recognition. That is why such
honour is paid to Odol, the World’s Dentifrice, the preserver of dental beauty, and preventive of dental decay.
The Tragedy of London Streets.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are men we meet every day who take such sar-
torial liberties as almost to drive one to despair. We
have to tolerate such monstrous combinations as brown
boots and frock-coats, silk hats and lounge suits, and
frock-coats and bowlers. —London Outfitter, 8/10/’OB.
Hard, bitter hard’s the man-of-fashion’s fate.
Faultlessly dressed he takes the outer air,
Only to have his gaze polluted, late
And early, by the horrid visions there.
In the West End no gentleman’s immune
From hungry beggars, wild with want and cold.
Eke there’s a type that does not importune,
A horrid youth, whose trousers show no fold ;
W ho wears a yachting cap in rakish wise.
And boots that never knew a valet’s care—
The third-rate dude. He makes the gorge to rise
Of him whose peace no pauper can impair.
The sandwich men—the shudd’ring anguished
band
That trails amid the slush—do not annoy
Your man of birth ; the sight he cannot stand
Is the warm-clad but vulgar draper’s boy.
He who, with self-complaisance in his eye,
Blazons in manner affable and free
A tall silk hat, tan shoes, and colored tie
Belonging to the Zingari C.C.
The sort who, when the shades of evening fall,
Climbs into hired evening clothes with zest,
And casts a rain-proof ulster over all,
And thrusts a blood-red ’kerchief in his vest.
There’s something picturesque about the sight
(Common enough) of twenty thousand men
In rags, publicly howling for the right
To work, and thereby clothe themselves ; but
when
The spectacle occurs of trading dolts
Striving to ape their betters, one grows sad ;
It is a trend at which the soul revolts
Of him who is not crazed, nor wholly bad.
Envoy.
Hard, bitter hard’s the man-of-fashion’s fate.

The Remarkable Finances of N.S.W.
A circumstance which may yet make the State
of New South Wales sit up in astonishment is
the marvellous increase of expenditure under the
Wade regime. Expenditure, in fact, seems to
have run wild, or gone mad, or something of the
sort. During the first four months (July to Octo-
ber, both inclusive) of the present financial year
the State got through £170,855 more than it did
during the corresponding period of the previous
year. An increase of over £117,000 a month, or
at the rate of over £1,400,000 a year, is something
considerable. And in addition to that, the loan
expenditure for the four months was £219,668
greater than in the corresponding period of last
year, and when loan expenditure grows at the
rate of about £660,000 a year that is also a cir-
cumstance which calls for notice. One of the most
surprising features of the case was the railways—
Johnson’s railways. These are the exact figures:
Julv-Oct., July-Oct.,
1907. 1908.
Revenue £1,646,448 £1,661,206
Working expenses . .. 860,767 1,091,014
Available for interest on cost
of construction .. ■.. £785,681 £570,192
And the tramways, which belong to the same
department, were only a shade less remarkable :
July-Oct., July-Oct.,
1907. 1908.
Revenue £312,553 £338,678
Working expenses .. .. 178,652 235,753
Available for interest on cost
of construction .. .. £133,901 £102,925
So it must be remembered that all the gorgeous ex-
pansion of outlay is done on a declining revenue,
though even in its decline it is such a gorgeous
revenue as no N.S.W. Premier before Wade ever
had the pleasure of handling. The income for
the four months dropped by £140,947 as compared
with the corresponding months of 1907. Here is
the exact situation :
July-October, July-October,
1907. 1908.
Revenue .. ... £4,551,524 £4,331,820
Expenditure .. 4,395,833 4,866,658
Surplus .. £155,691 Deficit .. £534,868
When these figures, showing that the N.S.W.
Treasury is £690,559 worse off as the result of
four months’ work than it was at this time last
year, are read in conjunction with an increase
(during four months only) of £219,668 in the loan
expenditure, they are somewhat startling. The
Wade Government seems to have gone mad, or
partially mad, in its finance. There was a
time in N.S.W. when the Treasurer was the
most important member of the Ministry,
and when Governments fell more often by
reason of financial incapacity than from any
other cause. In N.S.W. to-day the finances
seem a mere side-issue: Any left-off politician or
discredited opponent who has turned his coat
is good enough for a Treasurer, and any
kind of financial management does to go
on with. Carruthers lived politically, not
on his careful management of the public moneys,
but on the reputation he acquired for brutal and
unreasoning incivility to the Australian Govern-
ment. Wade lives on his reputation for incivility
to the Australian Government, on the honor he
acquires by being uncivil to the Opposition, and
on the dignity he accumulates by making’a
violent row over the Federal capital! Amid the
rush of all these urgent matters, the finances of
the State seem to be looking after themselves just
at present —doing the runaway locomotive act in
short.
The Bottle on the Mantelpiece.
The Cold Tea party scored another depressing
win or two at the Maoriland elections, and the
cursed Derrink is to be officially banned in Wel-
lington South, Wellington Suburbs, Wanganui,
and a few other districts ; while even in Auckland
city No License was only beaten by about 800 votes.
Yet, as the S. M. Herald’s correspondent wired
in anger in reply to a contributor to that paper,
Maoriland’s output of beer steadily rises, so “if
there is a smaller consumption in No-License dis-
tricts, which is certainly open to doubt, then the
increase in other parts of the country is truly
appalling.’’ That is the tall, hard fact that takes
a lot of climbing over; the more victorious
the Prohibitionists are, the bigger Maoriland’s
drink bdl gets —■ and what’s the good of
victories of that sort ? Maoriland, where the Pro-
hibitionist rages, is, in fact, the one section of
Australasia where the drink bill does get bigger—
barring little Tasmania, whose figures don’t move
much either way. In 1902 the Australian bill
was £3 14s. 6d. ; in 1906 it was £3 6s. Id. (These
are the figures of Victorian Government Statist
Drake, who has made something of a specialty of
this branch of statistical inquiry. His 1907
figures are not available yet.) But while there
was a shrinkage of Bs. sd. in the Australian bill,
the Maoriland figures in the same period moved
up from £2 13s. 2d. to £2 16s. Id. per head. The
extra 2s. lid. per head apparently represents the
extra consumption through Maoriland being com-
pelled to keep its comfort on the mantelpiece,
where it can put its lips to it when it feels
so disposed. But no less striking than the
figures in Maoriland, where the Prohibition party
is most militant, are those of Queensland, which
has had the least Cold Tea legislation of all the
States. For while the bill in Maoriland goes up,
that for Queensland falls more rapidly than it
does in any other State—falls, in fact, in this
remarkable way:—
1903 £3 16 3 per head
1904 3 13 4
1905 3 2 8
1906 2 19 9
And this, moreover, was in a period of unusual
prosperity, when under ordinary circumstances
the population might be expected to filleinup-
again oftenest. Next to Maoriland, South
Australia no doubt owns the most militant
no-license party; there the W.C.T.U. rages
furiously, and the pub is supposed to be such
a doomed institution that it is mostly
permitted to fall into decay—outside the
city, at any rate. Yet, cutting Westralia out
of the comparison, because of that State’s dispro-
portion of adult males, there was not a section of
the Commonwealth which got away with so much
liquor as S. Australia did in 1906, or in the past
three years. However beautiful its theories may
be, these figures must be hard chewing for Cold
Tea. Where that party is most active, the real
figures—the figures that matter, the figures that
show the liquor-consumption—are the least satis-
factory; and the one and only conclusion possible
is that, driven out of the pub. the population
drinks more at home; and the home-drinker
seems to be a heavier drinker than the pub-
drinker.
A Deplorable Possibility.
Already the hideous thing is being bruited about.
Said “ a prominent member of the Federal Oppo-
sition party,” among a heap of other foolishness,
to one of the country (N.S.W.) newspapers last
week
What should now be done is to appoint Mr. Reid as
High Commissioner.
There are many reasons why this dreadful propo-
sition appeals to the average Opposition member
in the Australian Parliament. The Opposition
hankers to get Reid right out of the way. He is
the only member of the party with any person-
ality worth mentioning. Whoever the nominal
Opposition leader may be, the actual leader
(when he can spare the time from his own
business in Sydney to attend to the business of
his country in the Australian Parliament) must,
for a long time to come, be Reid. Him the
Willy Kelly and Bill Wilks element of the
party have been trained for years past to regard
with the worshipping, hypnotised glare of the
domestic pup in the presence of its owner. They
cannot shake off the habit. They never will. It
would not matter so much from the Opposition
standpoint if Reid were (1) more self-effacing, or
(2) less maladroit. However, it is the fixed cus-
tom of Reid to make known his infrequent arrivals
at the seat of Government by bursts of oratorical
sound ; and, as Sydney Telegraph noted in effect
(18/11/08), the Reid of the Federal arena is a
chronic blunderer. He was well enough in State
politics; in the Australian Parliament he has
been consistently out of sympathy with the feeling
of the Commonwealth. He has come to be uni-
versally recognised as the advocate of causes that
are dead (such as Freetrade), or of causes (such as
Anti-Sosh) that, owing to their inherent idiocy,
have never really lived. And he persists in
rattling the bones of his corpses in the Repre-
sentatives at inopportune times, to the anguish
of the tacticians of his party. Reid will go down
in East Sydney at next Federal elections, provided
a reasonably strong Labor man opposes him. The
Opposition knows it, and chalks the fact up as an-
other reason to welcome with joy the shelving of its
discredited champion in an overseas billet.
Nor are all the Laborites and Leakin'- it,es as
resolute against the appointment as might be
wished. Reid has fought them hard. That fact,
far from prejudicing him in their eyes, tells in his
favor. There is a chivalrous desire to do a good
turn for an oid foe who has been worsted in the
fray. ' The sentiment is admirable in a sense, but
THE LOCAL ARTICLE.
The State Governor at the Manufacturers’ Exhibition
referred to the great increase in the factories of the
State, and said Australian people would be able to supply
everything for their own use. —Sydney TELEGRAPH.
N.S.W. : "Well, now you’ve mentioned it, Harry,
if those togs have to be worn when you’re done
with them, don’t you think I could supply
something to fill them myself!”
it is as poor an argument, withal, on behalf of the
disposal of a job of national importance as is the
sentiment of the Opposition on the same subjeet.
JR, KID possesses all the qualities that unfit a
man for the High Cornmissionership in the
present year of grace. At a time when the
United Kingdom is moving fast towards protec-
tion he remains a bigoted inhabitant of the lonely
little Cobden cave. The anomalous spectacle
would be offered, if the High Cornmissionership
went Reid’s way, of one'who loathes Protection
arriving from Australia, which jettisoned Free-
trade a decade ago, to represent Australia in
England, which promises to jettison Ereetrade
within the next few years. At a time when the
trend the world over is towards the nationalisa-
tion and municipalisation of big industries, Reid
stands out as a leader of political thought who
denounces such things as anarchy. He is a
hidebound Tory in a nation which is the
most democratic on earth. He is an exploiter
for party purposes of a sectarian feud that
should have been dead two centuries ago,
in a country wlrtch knows no distinction be-
tween its religious bodies. He is distrusted by
the importing classes of Australia, who were once
118 fiends, banned by the manufacturers, and re-
garded as a portentous joke by the workers.
Assuredly the Administration that was responsible
tor handing the High (Jornmissionership to such a
person would deserve all that came to it when
the constituencies got a chance to register their
opinion of the appointment.
The Victorian Law Department is up against
trouble. Nearly a year ago Bent passed an Inde,-
terminate Sentences Act, under which certain
classes of hopeful prisoners may be sent in-
definitely to reformatories, there to be put to
useful work, and, if possible, transformed into
desirable citizens. Having passed the Act, Bent
breathed heavily, and then let things slide. He
didn’t even trouble to provide reformatories; and
though the Act came into operation in July, and
many persons have been sentenced under it, no-
thing has been done beyond the appointment of a
Board to consider the cases. Hitherto these per-
sons have been seasoned offenders, with a set term
to serve first; but the other day, at Benalla,
Judge Moule sent two comparative novices to a
reformatory indefinitely, and, as there is no re-
formatory ready, the police kept them in the
Benalla lockup pending developments, or instruc-
tions, or something. Now, neither Victorian
lockups nor prisons are reformatories, wherefore
the two culprits threaten actions for damages,
and all sorts of trouble. And Bent and Chief Sec.
Mackey are wishing that Acts would administer
themselves.
+.
The Hugh Lennon Plow and Machine Co. made
an unmitigated ass of itself in connection with the
request of the House of Representatives Special
Committee on Stripper Harvesters and Drills.
Asked to give evidence before the committee the
co. declined, but instead offered to sell the
business, “lock, stock and barrel,” to the
Commonwealth on easy terms if the cash were not
available. Purchase money to be paid, free of
exchange, at some place outside of the Common-
wealth. This may be wit, but it is darned bad
taste. The Hugh Lennon Co. doesn’t mind
Commonwealth interference to protect it from the
cut-throat competionof the Standard Oil Trust pup,
—the one that makes and sells harvesters —but
when the same power proposes to interfere on
behalf of the co.’s employees and customers,- the co.
replies with insulting letters. The House of
Representatives is merely inquiring into the state
of the industry with a view to making things
better all round—for the manufacturer, the buyer
and the employee—and the fool Lennon Co.
snarls in effect that it only wants interference to
boost up its own selfish interests. And having
made this sort of exhibition of itself it wonders
why certain of the Labor and Farmers’ represent-
atives don’t vote for High Protection. Concerns
like the Lennon P. and M. Co. are the best friends
the Standard Oil Trust dumpers have in this
country.
o
Those friends of the undiscoverable Mrs. Smith,
who are always babbling about Socialism wanting
to fracture the marriage tie and bust up the ’appy
’ome, might consider the case of Norm an Leslie
Brooke, who lately asked a Victorian Judge for a
decree nisi. Seven years ago Norman, then 23,
and earning £75 a year as a clerk, got mar-
ried. To-day, after 14 years’ clerking for one big
Melbourne firm—his salary having gradually
risen to £lOO a year—he wants his marriage tie
fractured because his bride, having wearied of the
struggle to make ends meet (of “ expecting,” as
she put it, “ two adults and two children to live
on a boy’s wages”) has gone back to her parents
and declines to return. It is up to Anti-Sosh to
explain what it proposes to do about Brooke. He
is 30, has kept his job for 14 years (which sounds
as though he were a competent clerk), and helias got
a divorce from his wife because his one pound
eighteen and something a weekisn’t enough to keep
them both. Does Anti-Sosh expect the unmarried
Brookes to remain single the rest of their days?
Or should they go in for polyandry and share a
wife? Or are they expected to steal from their
employers? Or what ? It is all very fine to gas
about “breaking up the home,” but will Anti-
Sosh kindly get down to business and explain
exactly how a home is to be kept together on £lOO
a year ?

Some Woman Buys
for every home
and rightly so, as she goes more thoroughly into the matter than a man. The latter,
especially if he is a busy man, is inclined to take very little trouble, but the woman is
different she wants to know the why and wherefore of everything; so that it is good policy
for the woman to do the buying. A glance at our daily batch of country letters, or a glance
into our establishment, amply proves this, and at the same time proves that Stewart
Dawson’s has the confidence of a big percentage of the womenfolk of New South Wales.
We attend to their wants by mail or in person promptly and carefully, and deliver all their
orders free of charge. We will be glad to post our Christmas Budget of Gifts on receipt
of a post-card.

HE history of Wes-
tralia reads like that
of other Australian
States. It began
somewhat dismally
with tentative colo-
nisation, stagnated for years,
and then unexpectedly, almost
miraculously* burst into a blaze and
became a world’s news item. They had
found gold there in undrea’mt-of abundance, and
the cables sang with the fame of the discovery.
Thenceforth its life took on an astonishing virility;
the port of Fremantle swarmed with strangers,
brought from the East by the steamers of the
Five Companies—it was at last alive ! It pro-
gressed in jumps after years of comparative
dulness and nothingness. What an eternity
it was between the eighteen-twenties and
the eighteen-nineties—practically nothing doing,
and not overmuch done. Certainly they
had found gold, and were digging out gold
before Bailey revealed the riches of Coolgardie
in 1892 ; but those discoveries never caused
the extraordinary upheaval, the feverish impetus
in the population that Coolgardie did. And,
strange to say, Britain is declared not to have
desired Westralia as an appanage of the British
Crown —or at least was diffident of acquiring it.
France wanted it, it was said, wanted it badly in
those days, when international grab was an inter-
national fad. Now, the passion is not nearly so
fashionable. There is less for the Powers to grab
—unless they grab each other. However, Britain
forestalled France by settling at King George’s
Sound, where Albany now stands ; and that might
be said to have been the beginning of Westralia.
But it was not until 1829 that Britain seri-
ously plunged into the idea of colonisation.
In that year Captain Stirling arrived with
the first batch of immigrants. They had
complete equipment, obtained all the
land they wanted and more—but, of
course, no labor to assist in the
cultivation of their selections.
Apparently, they all wanted
to be landed proprietors—
people with a stake in the
country —for there was a
greater desire to lock up
the land in big estates
rather than to work it.
Such difficulties, combined with serious troubles
with the local aboriginals, almost decided
them to abandon the settlement altogether.
However, they didn’t, and where they
didn’t is somewhere about the spot where
Perth now stands. Perth has a fine situation
overlooking Perth Water —the name given to a
wide stretch of the Swan River —and has, more-
over, a climate equal to, if not superior to, that of
any capital in the Commonwealth. In the win-
ter, the alleged wet season, which lasts from about
April to October, Perth is about the most sup-
portable town on the continent; while in the
summer, although the temp'erature in the day may
be high, and often is high, its effects are never
felt, as almost invariably a cool sea-breeze sets in
towards evening. Indeed, the visitor will find
the climate of Perth more often than not
ideal, and, if he has never been there
before, has no chance of expiring from sheer
dulness. Amusements there are in plenty,
things to inspect in plenty, resorts to visit in
plenty —and never a day unswamped with in-
terest. The city is well laid out, but not too well
laid out. Inferior to Adelaide, perhaps, in orderly
arrangement or surroundings, it is still a good
example of Australian cities. Its St. George’s Ter-
race, the chief commercial thoroughfare, is indeed
imposing for a comparatively small city of 53,000
inhabitants. The buildings in it are mostly all
modern and stridently new, their architecture
undoubtedly excellent, and their sizes more
pleasing than ponderous. They do not hit. the
stranger in the eye, or stun him with an immen-
sity, like some of the buildings in Sydney
or Melbourne. Nor do they invite con-
tempt by a littleness, or cause smiles by
mean proportions. Perhaps it is that which gives
the Terrace its dignity without pompousness, for
it is like some parts of Collins Street, Melbourne
—wonderfully dignified in appearance, though it
has, of course, not nearly the bustle of the Vic-
torian thoroughfare.
(S3?
Despite its small size to the Easterner, the
Westralian capital has a number of public build-
ings which will appeal to the most critical con-
noisseur of architectural values. The Town Hall,
a building capable of holding 2000 people, strikes
the sight in Barrack Street by its very imposing-
ness. Next door is the Chamber in which
the Legislative Assembly meets, a build-
ing that is certainly not the most attract-
ive in the city, though it amply fulfils all
the requirements of the Government. It must be
remembered that, up to 1890, Westralia was a
Crown Colony, for it was only in that year that a
Constitution was first granted to it, with Sir John
Forrest, now Federal member for Swan, as the
first Premier. So that, in a manner of speaking,
the State has not had time to enter into any
ambitious schemes for the housing of its legis-
lators, though it has already done something in
that direction. One edifice in Perth that is bound
to get more than a glance even from the casual
sightseer is the G.P.O., built in the style of the
French Renaissance, its material brick, and its
ornaments finished off in cement. Another is the
Mint, interesting in that it is built of a freestone
that came from no further away than Cottesloe ;
while its dressing is of none other than Rottnest-
stone, particularly valuable for its strength and
durability. The earnest inquirer—and every
traveller is more or less an earnest inquirer—will
surely go to the Victoria Public Library, erected in
commemoration of the late Queen Victoria’s Jubi-
lee; or he will pounce in upon the Museum. The
Museum is an excellent one in its way. It con-
tains, among other things, specimens of Westra-
lian ornithology, the Tennant collection of fossils
and mollusca, besides relics from the wrecks of the
old Dutch ships Batavia and Zeewyk.
In and around Perth there are some very pretty
gardens, and some very pretty drives. There is,
for instance, the King’s Park, containing 1000
acres, and reached by a drive along a broad road
lined with Cape lilac and with mulberry trees.
There are Hyde Park, Queen’s Gardens, and the
Point Walter Picnic Reserve, half-way between
Perth and Fremantle, not to mention the Wel-
lington Recreation and King’s Esplanade Re-
serves. Those gardens, seen in bright moonlight,
are delights to the eye, and the surest cures for
melancholia. And, before concluding, it would
be as well to give the intending traveller a hint to
take a drive from South
Perth to the City, via the
Causeway, over the
Swan River, and to
come up from Fre-
mantle by the smart
little steamer Zephyr,
which puffs up to
the capital through
some of the most
fetching river
scenery in Austral-
asia.


Arms were Perfectly Raw—Desper-
ate with Terrible Irritation and
Almost Crazed by Lack of Sleep-
All Efforts at Cure Failed Until
MATRON OF HOSPITAL
RECOMMENDED CUTICURA
“Four years ago eczema broke out
on my hands and arms and I became so
)
bad that I was un-
able even to dress my-
self and I dared not put
my hands in water. Of
course I went to see a
doctor, but he held out
very slight hope of re-
covery. I persevered
with the treatment he
recommended, but
without any good re-
suit. At last I called on another doc-
tor, but he failed also to bring me any
benefit. I was suffering terribly then,
and I thought I should go out of my
mind, as I could neither sleep nor rest,
night or day. The skin was all hanging
in ribbons, and the arms looked just
like raw beefsteak, while the irritation
was so terrible that I got desperate
sometimes and felt I would like to
scratch my arms to pieces. I went to
three other doctors, and then I attended
the Hospital, but no one seemed
to be able to conquer the disease, and
I was on the very brink of despair when
I was advised by the matron of another
hospital to give Cuticura Remedies a
trial. I put some Cuticura Ointment
on the sores, and then I had the best
night’s rest I had had for many a long
day. I continued the applications and
also used Cuticura Soap and Cuticura
Resolvent Pills. I seemed to improve
all the time, and before I had used up
one box of Cuticura Ointment I could
do things in the house which I had not
been able to do for four years. By the
time two boxes of Cuticura Ointment
had been used I was completely cured
and my arms and hands, which had
been all laceration and blood, were cov-
ered by a beautiful new skin. Now
they are in as sound condition as ever.
I have paid pounds upon pounds for doc-
toring all for nothing, and now I can say
the Cuticura Remedies are worth their
weight in gold. Mrs. Jane Lee, Roma
Villa, Blackpool, Eng., Oct. 31, 1907.”

jjteinuiag pianoforte
is an instrument worthy in
every way. It has fully justified
its world-wide reputation for
excellent singing and playing
qualities, and is capable of
enduring the severest trials, at
the same time embodying an
ideal beauty of tone and even-
ness in its elasticity of touch
which strongly appeals to all
musicians requiring the very
finest results in interpreting the
works of the Great Masters.
The greatest critics are
unanimous in their opinion of
the STEINWAY PIANO-

that may be sung to with perfect
confidence. We will be glad
to demonstrate its good qualities
at our showrooms at any time.

abolishing the terrors of sea trips.
Most of the sickness suffered by people, and principally
ladies during sea trips arises from the smell of bilge
water’or oil or other unpleasant odors found on even the
best kept steamers. And it is this fear of sea-sickness
that loses our coasting steamers thousands of passengers
everv year. A good preventive of this main cause of
sea-sickness is now to be found in the new, cheap and
simple self-contained electrical appliance for the purpose
of distributing perfumes throughout steamers’ saloons,
cabins etc. It is a wonderful appliance, about the size of
a small mantelpiece clock, and is instantly put in motion
bv touching a little handle. It may be seen at Washing-
ton H Soul’s (Pattinson and Co.), Civil Service Co-op.,

BLACK DESPAIR
RIDES AWAY
before Mother Seigel’s Syrup. You
know that despair—the depression
and despondency which come from
constant headache, pain after eat-
ing, sickness, nausea, sleeplessness
and dizziness. Such constant
troubles make life almost a curse to
sufferers. But Black Despair rides
away, and the shadow on your life
is lifted, by Mother Seigel’s Syrup.
It is a purely vegetable remedy
which acts directly on the stomach
and liver, and thus removes the
cause of all these troubles Indiges-
tion —a disease which takes many
distressing forms, and is responsible
for nine-tenths of human misery.
It cured Mr. Driscoll (who now lives at
42, Mount Street, Pyrmont, N.S.W.) of
acute indigestion many years ago. Writing
on March 18th, 1908, he says : I remain
absolutely free of my old troubles and can
eat, work, and sleep as well as any man. I
cannot be sufficiently grateiul to Mother
Seigel’s Syrup for having restored to me
my lost heal tm”

The immense number of orders for
Frootoids, sent by post direct to the Pro-
prietor, is convincing proof that the
Public appreciate their splendid curing
power over the above-named complaints.
Frootoids are elegant in appearance and
pleasant to take; they are immensely
more valuable than an ordinary aperient;
they remove from the blood, tissues, and
internal organs, waste poisonous matter
that is clogging them and choking the
channels that lead to and from them.
The beneficial effects of Frootoids are
evident by the disappearance of headache,
a bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient medi-
cine to take when any Congestion or
Blood Poison is present, or when Conges-
tion of the Brain or Appoplexy is present
or threatening. They have been tested,
and have been proved to afford quick
relief in such cases when other aperients
have not done any good at all.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver;
a dose taken at bed-time, once a week, is
highly beneficial.
A constipated habit of body will be
completely cured if the patient will on
each occasion, when suffering, take a dose
of Frootoids, instead of an ordinary
aperient. The patient thus gradually
becomes independent of Aperient Medi-
cines.

“ Wang ” : A little Melbourne weekly was annoyed the
other day because a “ globe-trotting lady of literary pro-
pensities” was being subsidised by the Commonwealth
Government to write something about Papua. “Now,”
said the Melbourne paper, “there are at least a score of
brainy Australians who have seen Papua, explored it, ex-
perienced its heat and fevers, and wrought hard on its
pioneer goldfields and plantations. These men can write
from practical experience ; they can write from the Aus-
tralian point of view in expressive Australian phraseology.
Why has local talent been ignored?” Certainly! Hear
hear ! Encore ! We’ve been asking that very question
about that Melbourne paper for a long time. It prints a
short story every week, but when did it buj r one from a
“brainy Australian”? It finds stolen stuff a heap
cheaper, apparently.
* * * *
A well-deserved appreciation :
R. S. Ross, one of the “ revolutionists ” who got tired of
waiting for the Parliamentary Labor party, and recently
made things hot at Broken Hill, leaves that grimy place
to edit the new combined Melbourne and Sydney Socialist
Review, to be published in Melbourne. Ross, a Queens-
lander, went to Broken Hill to edit the Labor Troth, but
got to loggerheads with the crowd because it wouldn’t
travel fast enough ; so he started the Flame in the
interests of the revolutionary Socialists. Out of their very
slender means his little “ group ” bought a queer anti-
quated printing plant, which had long ago done duty and
afterwards rusted in a petered-out Never-Never mining
town. As Ross was the only printer in the organisation,
he had to be compositor, machinist, editor, proof-reader
and publisher all in one. It was a strenuous experience,
and the wonder was not that the Flame was passably
printed, but that it was ever printed at all. If that
quaint-looking old machine could talk it could tell inter-
esting stories of a few dust-begrimed men coming off
“ shift” in the dreary hours of the night and sweating at
the little press until daylight, grinding out copies of “The
Tongue of the Revolution.” Whatever else Ross and his
little band of “comrades” lacked, it certainly wasn’t
enthusiasm and a fine capacity for hard, unremitting
graft.

Compared with those of N.S.W., what vigorous sheets
the provincial papers of Queensland are ! And they grow
in strength and influence. The Queensland Times
(Ipswich), one of the oldest papers in the State, has been
content to hitherto talk three times a week ; now it
becomes a daily. This brings up the list of Queensland
dailies to 20—Brisbane, two morning, two evening ; Bun-
daberg, two ; Cairns, two; Charters Towers, two;
Ipswich, one ; Mackay, two ; Maryborough, one ; Rock-
hampton, two ; Toowoomba, two ; Townsville, two.
Twenty dailies, about 50 tri-weeklies, and a myriad
weeklies and monthlies are a fair supply for a total popu-
lation of little over half a million.
ACCORDING TO THE “DAILY TELEGRAPH.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Not only has the Railway Department, in compiling its
new time-table, failed to make any provision for bringing
the people of the country districts into closer touch with
the metropolis in the matter of the circulation of the morn-
ing newspapers, but it has taken at least two positively
retrograde steps. . . . There is a studied refusal on the
part of the Railway Department to provide any train at
all which will servp for the early carriage of newspapers.
It would be interesting to know why ! — 799th wail or moan
from the Sydney D.T. since Protection of Sydney dailies
was abolished by the Railway Department.
The great heart of the country is beating with fierce
throbs
(According to the Daily Telegraph),
And the country folk are comfortless and throwing up
their jobs
(According to the Daily Telegraph),
And rage and gloom and horrid threats fill all the land-
scape fair,
And blaze like violet lightnings through the circumam-
bient air,
And everything is chaos where it isn’t dark despair
(According to the Daily Telegraph).
And why? The question’s foolish, ill-considered and
absurd !
(According to the Daily Telegraph.)
The People’s heart is bursting at the woe that has
occurred
(According to the Daily Telegraph).
You have but to read the papers with a calm and open
mind
And instantly the Horror—on the cable-page—you’ll
find—
The journal reaches farmer Jones an hour or two behind !
(This desolates the Daily Telegraph.)
You see the country people cannot live without the news
(As tinctured by the Daily Telegraph).
They spend their nights in weeping if they cannot read
the views
So cherished by the Daily Telegraph ;
A fierce, consuming sorrow which will never, never rest
Holds every mind in thrall and burns like fire in every
breast
When the miserable people of the North and South and
West
Fail to obtain the Daily Telegraph !
The greybeards of the township feel the burden of the
years
(According to the Daily Telegraph)
In doubly-poignant measure, and take refuge in salt tears
(According to the Daily Telegraph).
The middle-aged refuse their food —the young folk tipple
deep ;
The boys and girls avoid the schools ; the babies will not
sleep ;
The cows will not let down their milk, the goats forget
to leap
(According to the Daily Telegraph).
A stricken nation perisheth, its people pale and pine
(According to the Daily Telegraph)
Because it cannot promptly read the latest gibe at Lvne
(According to the Daily Telegraph)—
Because it is deprived a day or so of all the sneers
The paper prints about the Commonwealth—the flouts
and jeers
It aims at Alfred Daakin, or at Fisher’s hopes and fears
(They do not suit the Daily Telegraph).
The land abounds with papers, but of course they do not
count
(According to the Daily Telegraph).
The People will have Sydney ink —and want it from the
fount
(According to the Daily Telegraph).
They take their thoughts and views from it, that black
and bubbling well !
Their politics, and art, and law, and how to speak and
spell—
Their transcendental Heaven and their most material
Hell
(According to the Daily Telegraph).
Come, weep with me, my brethren, for this bitter wrong
and grief
Inflicted on the Daily Telegraph ;
The soullessness of Johnson has outdistanced all belief
In his treatment of the Daily Telegraph !
Let every paper outside Sydney be at once suppressed !
Run hourly “ specials ” (papers free) to North and South
and West,
And give the suffering patriarchs and babes and goats
some rest
By sending them the Daily Telegraph !

RUPTURE
CURED BY ELECTRICITY.

is a positive cure for all forms of
Rupture. Write for full particulars and copies of testimonials.
Weakness Cannot Win
in the battle of life. Life’s battle is a hard one, and you must have steady nerve, a clear brain, and muscles like
bands of steel. The weak man or woman must give way to the strong, the robust and the vigorous. Your health and
physical vitality should be guarded as the miser guards his gold. Dr. McLaughlin, the electrical authority, has discov-

ered the true method of applying Electricity for the perfect cure of the ills and ailments
of mankind. Electricity is Nature’s Remedy. There is not a weak person in
this whole world to-day who cannot become strong, healthy and vigorous again if they
will only apply the right current of Electricity. We have a method of applying Electricity
for the cure of the various weaknesses of men and women which will cure in every case.
Our method of applying Electricity is fast supplanting the use of drugs all over the world.
DRUGS ARE USELESS!
Drugs cannot and will not cure the Nervous Ailments and Weaknesses of Men and
Women, such as Loss of Vigor and Vitality, Rheumatism, Kid-
ney, Liver and Bladder Troubles, Constipation, Stomach
Disorders, etc., etc. Nature never intended a man’s stomach to be the
receptacle for strong drugs, and if you persist in their use it will not be long until
you will be beyond curing ; your stomach will be totally destroyed. Electricity,
when applied by Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt, gives to every part
of the body—as it travels over the nerves—strength and vitality, and quickly
drives out disease, no matter where it is located. When you are weak there is
simply a lack of Electricity in the system—not enough electricity to keep up your
nerve force —and before you can again be restored to vitality and vigor electricity
must be supplied. Weakness defeats the aim or ambition of man. The weak
man must be made strong before he has the necessary energy and brain power to
succeed. Electricity builds up the shattered nervous system, restores strength and
vitality, makes rich, red blood ; it is the bulwark against which disease must fall. It brings
the sunbeams of happiness and health into a life which has been darkened by weakness. We have thousands of
testimonials to prove all our assertions. Our belt is simple, easy to use and is guaranteed to give a strong current.
It has special attachments fop men and women. They are within the reach of all; price £1 and up.
Beware of cheap imitations.

Under the Charter of Justice granted to
N.S.W. in 1814 there was created in Sydney a
Court bearing a close family resemblance to that
of Judge Heydon under the Industrial Disputes
Act. The merchants and traders of the day, who
had previously had no standing and were not even
allowed to hold a public meeting, were permitted
as a matter of grace to petition for a Court, and
in answer received what was called a Supreme
Court of Civil Judicature. The Bench of this
court consisted of a barrister (sent from England)
and two laymen as assessors. The barrister was
not supposed to understand commerce, and he
didn’t; the assessors were not supposed to under-
stand law, and they didn’t. Also they were too
stupid to teach one another anything, and the
Court soon became a byword for eccentricities.
“ 10-2-4 ” in response :
Permit me one last word with “ 1-3-6” —tipster in con-
nection with the forthcoming N.S.W. Chief Justice event.
He brushes aside the winning chances of Adrian Knox
and Alexander Gordon because “ no Equity man has the
faintest idea of evidence or of the strength or credibility
of witnesses.” This I take leave to denounce as rot,
abject and demonstrable. A big proportion of the work
done by both Knox and Gordon is nisi prius. They are
held by leading Gentlemen One to be surpassingly good
hands with all classes of witnesses, and the Gentlemen
One, in earnest of their opinion, give the twain all
the witness cases they can handle. Knox is
charged bv “ 1-3-6" with being (1) “mentally dapper ” ;
(2) “curatical.” Which seems to me a contradiction
in terms. I turn up “dapper” in someone else’s
Webster, and find it signifies “ trim, smart, lively.” The
lexicographer wots not the term “curatical,” but I take
it to mean “ curate-like which adjective doesn’t fit
Knox, racehorse owner and A.J.C. committeeman.
“1-3-6” piles his savings on Shand for the C.J. contest,
with a saver on Cullen. Like all tipsters, he is a gambler
--a backer of 33 to 1 chances. A possible development in
this struggle is that C. G. Wade will persuade Pilcher to
keep the appointment warm for him for three years. It
is likely that Wade will be as sick of politics by then as
Pilcher will be of the Chief Justiceship. However,
Pilcher, who likes his ease, mayn’t be taking any.
Again, there is the likelihood of R. E. O’Connor
being sounded in the matter; and the still greater
likelihood of his refusing. Remain Knox and
Gordon and no others. Gordon is understood to
prefer that Knox should be Chief Justice, and indeed,
taking into consideration Knox’s wide knowledge of every
section of the community, his high personal character,
his ability as a lawyer, and his reputation for unbiassed
fairness of mind, it is hard to conceive a better. My
money is on Knox, nor shall I place, bet or hedge one
farthing of it for all the “ 1-3-6’s ” that ever went Chief
Justice picking.

“ Hamer ” : In a Sydney suburb are two
onetime friends, between whom the malevolent
influence of threepence has thrown bitterness,
hatred and the shadow of Cain. In the legendary
past, when relations were strained by the heat of
a municipal by-election, Smith’s little girl took a
Coin into the shop of Jones, which coin Smith de-
clared was sixpence* while Jones swore it was only
threepence. Smith said that a paltry three cop-
pers was nothing to him, but he objected to being
had ; and Jones remarked, with bitterness, that he
would have gladly given £3 to keep the old friend-
ship intact, but he objected to being “ shown
points.” Thereafter neither Could forget that
threepence. Smith at first displayed a mere cold
contempt towards a mart who could make such
a fuss over a paltry sum of money;
but his views of Jones’ villainy gradually ex-
panded, until from regarding Jones as an untrust-
worthy individual, he began to look upon him as
a shameless scoundrel; and finally he confided to
his friends that Jones was “ the biggest bla’guard
God ever created.” It was only natural that
Jones’ feelings should also develop ; and his final
vjew of Smith was a shade worse than Smith’s
view of Jones. The atmosphere of their neigh-
borhood was thick with mutual revilings, and local
residents made the vicinity a place of meeting in
tneir spare moments in the hope of being present
at the inevitable explosion. It came at length,
when the exasperated Jones visited Smith’s shop,
and explained his opinion of Smith. Smith added
to his opinion of Jones a libellous history of that
gentleman’s birth and ancestry. Other compli-
ments passed, chairs passed, blows passed
in fact, everything passed except the gene-
ral public .in the street, and the memory
of the threepence. Then the Law intervened.
Both Jones and Smith suffered fines and Costs,
and the harrowing thought of threepence rankles
with an augmented intensity, and any day Smith
may set a light, to .Tones’ house, or Jones may
kill, bm th’s dog, and drop the remains down
Smith s chimney into the fire, where its hair will
flare up like a rocket.

One Hundred and Three.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WITH the frame of a man, and the face of
a boy, and a manner strangely wild,
And the great, wide, wondering, inno-
cent eyes of a silent suffering child ;
With his hideous dress and his heavy boots, he
drags to Eternity—
And the Warder says, in a softened tone : “ Keep
step, One Hundred and Three.”
’Tis a ghastly travesty of drill—or a ghastly farce
of work —
But One Hundred and Three, he catches step
with a start, a shuffle and jerk.
’Tis slow starvation in separate cells, and a
widow’s son is he,
And the widow, she drank before he was bom—
(Keep step, One Hundred and Three !)
They shut a man in the four-by-eight, with a four-
inch slit for air,
Twenty-three hours of the twenty-four, to brood
on his virtues there.
And the dead stone walls and the iron door close
in as an iron band
On eyes that followed the distant haze far out on
the level land.
Bread and water and hominy, and a scrag of meat
and a spud'—
A Bible and thin flat book of rules, to cool a
strong man’s blood—
They take the spoon from the cell at night—and
a stranger might think it odd ;
But a man might sharpen it on the floor, and go
to his own Great God.
One Hundred and Three, it is hard to believe
that you saddled your horse at dawn ;
There were girls that rode through the bush at
eve, and girls who lolled on the lawn.
There were picnic parties in sunny bays, and
ships on the shining sea ;
There were foreign ports in the glorious days—
(Hold up, One Hundred and Three !)
A man came out at “ exercise” time from one of
“ the cells,” to-day :
’Twas the ghastly spectre of one I knew, and I
thought he was far away ;
We dared not speak, but he signed “ Farewell —-
fare—well,” and I knew by this
And the number stamped on his clothes (not
sewn ) that a heavy sentence was his.
Where five men do the work of a boy, with
warders not to see,
It is sad and bad and uselessly mad, it is uglv as
it can be,
From the flower-beds laid to fit the gaol, in circle
and line absurd,
To the gilded weathercock on the church, agape
like a strangled bird.
Agape like a strangled bird in the sun, and I
wonder what he could see ?
The Fleet come in, and the Fleet go out ? (Hold
up, One Hundred and Three !)
The glorious sea, and the bays and Bush, and
the distant mountains blue
(Keep step, keep step, One Hundred and Three,
for my lines are halting too).
The great, round church with its volume of sound,
where we dare not turn our eyes—
They take us there from our separate hells to
sing of Paradise.
In all the creeds there is hope and doubt, but of
this there is no doubt :
That starving prisoners faint in church, and the
warders carry them out.
They double-lock at four o’clock and the warders
leave their keys,
And the Governor strolls with a friend at eve
through his stone conservatories ;
Their window slits are like idiot mouths with
square stone chins adrop,
And the weather-stains for the dribble, and the
dead flat foreheads atop.
No light save the lights in the yard beneath the
clustering lights of the Lord—
And the lights turned in to the window slits of
the Observation Ward.
(They eat their meat with their fingers there in a
madness starved and dull—
Oh ! the padded cells and the 0.8.5. are nearly
always full.)
Rules, regulations—red-tape and rules ; all and
alike they bind :
Under “ separate treatment ” place the deaf ; in
the dark cell shut the blind !
And somewhere down in his sandstone tomb,
with never a word to save,
One Hundred and Three is keeping step, as he’ll
keep it to his grave.
The press is printing its smug, smug lies, and pay-
ing its shameful debt—
It speaks of the comforts that prisoners have, and
“ holidays ” prisoners get.
The visitors come with their smug, smug smiles
through the gaol on a working day,
And the public hears with its large, large ears
what authorities have to say.
They lay their fingers on well-hosed walls, and
they tread on the polished floor ;
They peep in the generous shining cans with their
ration Number Four.
And the visitors go with their smug, smug smiles ;
the reporters’ work is done ;
Stand up ! my men, who have done your time on
ration Number One !
Speak up, my men ! I was never the man to
keep my own bed warm,
I have jogged with you round in the Fools’
Parade, and I’ve worn your uniform ;
I’ve seen you live, and I’ve seen you die, and
I’ve seen your reason fail—
I’ve smuggled tobacco and loosened my tongue—
and I’ve been punished in gaol.
Ay! clang the spoon on the iron floor, and shove
in the bread with your toe,
And shut with a bang the iron door, and clank the
bolt—just so,
With an ignorant oath for a last good-night—or
the voice of a filthy thought.
By the Gipsy Blood you have caught a man
} T ou 11 be sorry that ever you caught.
Without meat he shall be buried alive, for a dav
and a night unheard
If be speak to a fellow prisoner, though he die for
want of a word.
He shall be punished, and he shall be starved, he
shall in darkness rot,
He shall be murdered body and soul—and God
said, “ Thou shalt not! ”
I’ve seen the remand-yard men go out, by the
subway out of the yard—
And I’ve seen them come in with a foolish grin
and a sentence of Three Years Hard.
They send a half-starved man to the court, where
the hearts of men they carve—
Then feed him up in the hospital to give him the
strength to starve.
You get the gaol-dust in your throat, in your skin
the dead gaol-white ;
You get the gaol-whine in your voice and in every
letter you write.
And in your eyes comes the bright gaol-light—not
the glare of the world’s distraught,
Not the hunted look, nor the guilty look, but the
awful look of the Caught.
There was one I met —’twas a mate of mine—in
a gaol that is known to us ;
He died—and they said it was “ heart disease,”
but he died for want of a truss.
I knelt at the head of the pallid dead, where the
living dead were we,
And I closed the yielding lids with my thumbs—
(Keep step, One Hundred and Three !)
A criminal face is rare in gaol, where all things
else are ripe^—
It is higher up in the social scale that you’ll find
the criminal type.
But the kindness of man to man is great when
penned in a sandstone pen—
The public call us the “criminal class,” but the
warders call us “ the men.”
The brute is a brute, and a kind man kind, and
the strong heart does not fail —
A crawler’s a crawler everywhere, but a man is
a man in gaol !
For forced “desertion” or drunkenness, or a
law’s illegal debt,
While never a man who was a man was “ re-
formed ” by punishment yet.
The champagne lady comes home from the course
in charge of the criminal swell
They carry her in from the motor car to the lift in
the Grand Hotel—
But armed with the savage Habituals Act they are
waiting for you and me,
And the drums they are beating loud and neai.
(Keep step, One Hundred and Three !)
The clever scoundrels are all outside, and the
moneyless mugs in gaol—
Men do twelve months for a mad wife’s lies or
life for a strumpet’s tale.
If the people knew what the warders know, and
felt as the prisoners feel—
If the people knew they would storm their gaols
as they stormed the old Bastille.
And the cackling, screaming half-human hens who
were never mothers nor wives
Would send their sisters to such a hell for the
term of their natural lives,
Where laws are made in a Female Flit in the
Land of the Crazy Fad,
And drunkards in judgment on drunkards sit and
the mad condemn the mad.
The High Church service swells and swells where
the tinted Christs look down—
It is easy to see who is weary and faint and
weareth the thorny crown.
There are swift-made signs that are not to God,
and they march us Hellward then.
It is hard to believe that we knelt as boys to
“for ever and ever, Amen.”
Warders and prisoners all alike in a dead rot dry
and slow—
The author must not write for his own, and the
tailor must not sew.
The billet-bound officers dare not speak and dis-
charged men dare not tell
Though many and many an innocent man must
brood in this barren hell.
We are most of us criminal, most of us mad, and
we do what we can do.
(Remember the Observation Ward and Number
F'orty-Two.)
There are eyes that see through stone and iron,
though the rest of the world be blind—
We are prisoners all in God’s Great Gaol, but the
Governor, He is kind.
They crave for sunlight, they crave for meat, they
crave for the might have been,
But the cruellest tiling in the prison walls is the
craving for Nicotine.
But the spirit of Christ is everywhere where the
heart of a man can dwell,
It comes like tobacco in prison—or like news
to the separate cell.
* * * *
They have smuggled him out to the Hospital with
no one to tell the tale,
But it's little the doctor and nurse can do for the
patient from Starvinghurst Gaol.
He cannot swallow the food they bring, for a
gaol-starved man is he,
And the blanket and screen are ready to draw—
(Keep step, One Hundred and Three !)
“ What were you doing, One Hundred and
Three?” and the answer is “ Three years
hard,
And a month to go ” —and the whisper is low :
‘ ‘ There’s the moonlight—out in the yard. ”
The drums, they are beating far and low,'and the
footstep’s light and free,
And the angels are whispering over his bed ;
“ Keep step, One Hundred and Three ! ”

have Zam=Buk handy for the safe and speedy healing of every
kind of superficial injury. Zam=Buk makes new,
healthy skin grow over a wound. Directly it is
applied, a process of healing is set up which
resembles a builder putting up
row after row of new houses. An
injury smeared over with the
Balm loses its fire, and does not
have the chance to fester. Both
as an antiseptic and healer Zam-
Buk is totally different from, and
superior to, all ordinary oint-
ments, salves and embrocations.
Every home needs its pot of
Zam-Buk.
Mr. R. H. S. Thompson, Head Goods-
shed Porter at Wagga Wagga, N.S.W.,
says:—“l have derived much benefit from the
use of Zam-Buk Balm. During my occupation I
am constantly getting my hands knocked and cut
about, and I assure you Zam-Buk comes.in very
handy. It seems to act like magic on cuts and
bruises, and quickly heals them up. I find Zam-
Buk very beneficial for chilblains also. My
children suffered very much with them last
mn
m
n
winter, and, although f tried several remedies, 1 found nothing to compare with Zam-
Buk. This Balm applied properly very soon takes away the burning and irritation. I
recommend Zam-Buk strongly, and no home should be without it.”
Zam-Buk Balm is a Speedy Cure for Piles, Eczema, Boils, Running Sores, Sore Legs,
Ringworm, Barcoo, etc. As an Embrocation for Strained Muscles and Tendons, Zam-Buk,
rubbed well into the parts affected, is Unequalled. As a Household Balm for Cuts, Burns,
Bruises, Sores, Blackheads, Pimples, etc., Zam-Buk is Invaluable. Obtainable from all
Stores and Medicine Vendors at 1/6, or 3/6 Larp-e Family Pot (containing nearly four
times the 1/6), or direct from the Zam-Buk Co., 39 Pitt Street, Sydney.

been proved to possess a speed up to 27J knots.— Cable.
MINE is the strength and the speed,
The oceans are wholly mine ;
I fly like a-stag at need
Or fight in the plunging line ;
My voice is the scream of Death
From blackened and hateful lips,
As the red flame runs from the lunatic guns
That rave at the sinking ships.
Crouched in their, turrets grey
My wide-mouthed arbiters stare,
Ever by night and day
To the far horizon where
The smoke of the foemen streams
Like a banner across the sea ;
“You may fight or run,” 1 says the 12-inch gun,
“ It is all the same to me ! ”
The battleships surge along,
Like bullies that lurch and reel;
And the lean destroyers throng,
Like a pack of hounds at heel ;
I fret and fume in my place
As the flutt’ring signals talk
From the flagship’s bridge to'giant and midge
When across the deep we walk.
I am the King of the Fleet,
But my ocean reign is short;
For I hear the ceaseless beat
Of hammers within the port;
My rivals are on the slips,
And my kingship’s nearly done ;
“ A merry, short life and war to the knife 1 ”
Growls the brooding 12-inch gun.

The Pacific Gull.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY aunt, with whom I live, is a Sweden-
borgian one week, a Theosophist the
next, and a Neo-Buddhist the next,
changing her religion each time she reads the pro-
spectus of a new faith. But, deep in her heart,
the good soul is a Pythagorean, with one un-
changing passion. She has always surrounded
herself with animals—of which 1 am the least
considered —and birds. Birds are her pet creations.
She had, until quite lately, a collection of the
most barren hens in Australia. “Poor old
things,” she would say, when I suggested obse-
quies; “it woulu he most ungrateful of me,
Hassan. Simply because they haven’t laid for
nine years. When I remember how they did
lay ! How would you like to be killed when you
stopped lay—l mean, when you got too old to
work ?” This argument was quite unanswerable,
and the liens went on eating me out of house and
home.
Open slaughter being out of the question I re-
sorted to strategy. I introduced my neighbor’s
young and ardent fox-terrier into the fowl-run
one night. But m the morning the dog had all
his teeth blunted and Ins jaw crippled, and only
one hen was slightly dented. This experiment
tends to throw out m bold relief the monumental
digestion of the monster which shortly appeared
upon the scene.
Besides these antiquities my aunt had four more
or less profane parrots —I myself had seen to their
profanity —an obese Maltese poodle, a tom-cat, 17
canaries, and about 30 seagulls. These last ran
about on the front lawn, and looked very pretty,
and squawked all night, and fought like devils
over their food all day. When one was handled
he would disgorge his breakfast. This pleasing
ceremony is quite a habit amongst sea-birds, says
my aunt, and she ought to know, having had a
lover drowned at sea. Often I wish he had
lived.
One morning my friend Eccleston asked me
whether I thought my aif.it would care for a
Pacific Gull. I replied that she would he
pleased to have any extremely useless thing
in feathers. Had it any parlor-tricks? He
said that it had one—the one mentioned
above as common to all sea-birds. He would
bring it round next morning. I told him not
to hurry, hut he said that, since he felt he
must part with it, he had better get the leave-
taking over as soon as possible. And, sure
enough, he turned up at half past four next morn-
ing with a sack, and tumbled a large grey bird
out on the lawn. It was about the size of a large
goose, with a very fat back and a calculating eye.
Its beak was a forbidding-looking affair about
seven inches long, hooked at the end. And the
smell! —the breath of an iguana was frangipanni
to it. I was not enthusiastic, hut my aunt was
quite delighted. She asked whether it was good-
tempered, and whether it would be shy if it were
let run amongst the gulls. Eccleston opened his
mouth, shut it again hurriedly, and mumbled that
shyness was not one of its failings. Then he
went off, leaving the sack, which I carried per the
tongs to the kitchen lire.
So the Pacific Gull came to stay with us. The
seagulls hated it like poison, and sent it to
Coventry, but it didn’t seem to care, standing upon
one leg all day in a corner of the lawn with one
eye open—the eye that was nearest the seagulls.
And by-and-bye I noticed that the number of
these latter had diminished. I put it down at
first to the butcher’s boy, who invariably left the
gate open when he called. I locked the garden
gate and he had to go round the other way, but
still the birds disappeared. I thought then that
they must be growing their cut pinion feathers
and flying away, so I overhauled those birds that
remained and bought others. Even this did not
stop the disappearance ; they went quicker than I
could renew them at 2s. a time. My aunt sus-
pected a marauding cat. I suspected the boy next
door. But one morning, getting up early, I
looked out upon the lawn, and saw the Pacific
Gull scientifically rounding up the mob and
reaching out for the fattest. I ran out and
grabbed him by the wing, and he hissed at me
and disgorged a defunct gull upon my foot. A
happy thought struck me. I cuffed his head and
carried him, snapping viciously, to the fowl-run.
When he saw the fowls his eye lighted up. He
ceased snapping, and gurgled with delight.
I had solved the fowl difficulty. The whole
13 went in 13 days. My poor old aunt was quite
prostrated with grief, but never imagined that
one stout bird, the size of a goose, could eat a fowl
every day for a couple of weeks. Indeed, she
thought that the Pacific Gull was quite sorry for
them. “He looks such a kind old thing,” she
said, gazing at the monster, who stood on one leg,
peering anxiously into the empty fowl-house.
Then, to crown the old lady’s mystification and
anguish, two days after the disappearance of the
last hen, the tom-cat became a memory, and the
profanest parrot was not. The Pacific Gull had
broken out of the fowl-pen and waddled round to
the front verandah.
But the next morning the murder was out, for
my aunt rescued the Maltese poodle in extremis ,
and revived him before the kitchen fire with sat
volatile. Promptly, after the hysterics ceased, I
was blamed for the whole thing.
When I saw Eccleston I spoke severely to him.
Why had he given me the bird ? Because, if you
please, it had eaten his hoy’s pet guinea-pigs, the
servant’s best hat (which had three stuffed owls
in it), two cats, and the next-door neighbor’s Irish
terrier, and had been caught dragging the baby
from the ; perambulator. I was really annoyed
with Eccleston—his frankness had come too late
to be considered a virtue. But then I remem-
bered the departed hens, and forgave him.
However, my mind was made up. I would not
keep the bird any longer. As I went home I de-
bated in mv mind the “deep damnation of his
taking off.” It was really a shame to kill a
creature who enjoyed life like this one. And, as
I reached the,gate, I thought of Cadge. Cadge
had always wanted it; he never ceased in his en-
thusiasm for the bird. Well, he should have it.
Cadge was not exactly an enemy of mine, hut lie
was a bore, which was infinitely worse. He de-
served all that Providence, in the shape of a fat
grey bird, might inflict upon him.
Cadge called a couple of days later and admired
the gull again with obvious intent and covetous-
ness shining in his eye. “Well,” I said, “ take
him, old chap. But, whatever you do, give him
company—plenty of cheerful company ; lie’s a
sociable beast, and can t live without it.”
“ Does he take to fowls?” asked my victim,
who kept prize Langshans.
“ He is very fond of them,” I replied, going in-
doors for a pillow-slip.
So the Pacific Gull went into a new home, and
35 prize Langshans were as if they iiad never
been. His host thereupon gave him to another
man whose neighbor’s fowls used toffy over his
fence and take dust-baths in his garden. This
man valued the bird above rubies until, the
neighbor’s fowls having taken their last dust-bath,
it coaxed his cockatoo (who had been thoroughly
educated by a whole ship’s company) to the side
of the cage, one day, by scratching its head with
its beak, and then dragged it through. That same
day it tried to devour the baker’s hoy and the
policeman who came to look for illegal dogs.
Wherefore it went to the Zoo, and is there to
this day. It lives very sadly, shut in a barred
enclosure, fed with hut 31b. of horseflesh a day,
and casting ravenous eyes upon the elephant as
she swings ponderously past in her appointed
orbit, with her load of children upon her back.
Some day, I feel sure, the bird will escape, and
there will he no more Zoo.

DEAD?” said the fruit-lady, putting
another apricot into the bag and letting
her hand rest carelessly on the scale.
“Dead? Yes, ’e’sdead— died on We’n’sday, an
left all ’is clo’es to Halbert ! ’N’ twenty pound.
Halbert? W'y, young Halbert ’Art, ’on's goiu’
to marry my Hann. Halbert’s got a soft thing on
now, with the two old ladies to groom, an’ no old
boss to curse ’im out ! Halbert was in, \\ e ii'-Miay
night, fer a supprise, to take Hann to th’ th aytt .•
on th’ strength of it, but she didn’t know in time,
an’ th’ fire’d gone out, an’ there was no ’ot water
ready, an’ she ’adn’t washed for a low neck, ’n’ so
she couldn’t go with ’im, bein’ in ’is evenin’clo’es
just left ’im as I tol’ y\ She was disjointed ! ”
A young man hounded in over the step.
“Even’, Muzher,” he murmured, and the air
was filled with the odor of freshly-pulled deer.
“Evenin’, Halbert!” said Mother. “Ann’s
inside in th’ parlor, Halbert —walk in.”
The young man hounded on. in three or four
peculiar, long bounds, and disappeared inside.
Mother went on talking, and in a few moments
Halbert came back into the shop and sat down.
“ Ain’t she ready, Halbert?’’ asked Mother.
“Noshet,” said Albert. “I’ll shay ’ere—’n’
wait! Do’ min’ me ! ”
Mother went oil talking to me in a low voice,
low enough, anyhow, not to he heard in the street,
and Albert began singing softly to himself—a
hymn, with odd pauses for breath in unexpected
places.
After a little Ann entered, in a blaze of wild
coloring and a swish of frills She wore a
“cloud,” beneath which her shoulders showed
above a low-cut frock —a stout little animal,
pleasing enough when regarded from a distance
of a few feet.
“Well, Mr. Hart.” she shrilled, flippantly,
“’re y’ quite ready?”
Albert attempted to rise, hut sat down again,
and seemed to sit further down than ever.
A fruity odor filled the shop, distinctive from
all the other odors.
Albert made another attempt to rise—and re : ".
slowly, and walked towards Ann. The fr .op’
odor increased, and Ann approached the ch.iir
upon which Albert had been sitting. Then she
turned Albert to the light, and burst into tears.
“O Alberti " 1 she moaned, in hitter woe, “’N’
it’s the second disappointment I’ve ad this week.”
Mother, mystified, came over to exhort her
offspring.
“W’y,” she demanded, “wot is the matter?
Wot’s ’e done ? Wot’s ’appened ?”
The sobs scarcely lessened in volume and wet
ness.
Albert stood swaying on his pins, and looked
stupidly down at his sorrowful fair.
“’Sorright!” he said, with slow indignation.
“’Sorright ! Wosser matt’? Gorrer tickets!
Gorrer dreshoot on ! Gorrer shamfare ! Woh
woh—woh— more jewant ? ’Sorright! ”
Ann looked wildly up at him.
“O, it’s not orright ! ” she broke out pas-
sionately. “ Mother ! ” she wailed, and again
turned Albert to the light.
“ Well, wot is it ? ” demanded Mother. “ Wot’s
’appened ? ”
“Apricots!” shrieked Ann, and sobbed some
more. “ ’E’s been sittin’ in Mis’ White’s basket
of apricots ever since ’e came in ! ”
Albert’s dull eyes goggled, and his mouth
opened. He seemed to find a difficulty in speech.
Contorting, he looked down at himself, and then
stared horribly at the others as the fulness of the
calamity dawned on his beery intelligence.
“Thought—though—thought it was cushion!”
he groaned, dismally, and looked wildly about
him. The street door stood ajar. It was still day
outside ; but within the glare of the women’s eyes
was brighter than a searchlight. Albert hesitated
a moment, turned for the door, and bounded
thither in two long bounds, groaning, and plunged
into the street. Ann fell upon her mother’s neck,
and wept there continually. . . .
The door stood wide open. Unnoticed, I seized
my bag and stole out into the cool, fruitless air.

There is a closer relationship between Health
and Disposition than many people would
imagine. a man is in the enjoyment of
perfect health—when his face glows and his
eyes sparkle with life and vigour—when his
step is elastic and his whole demeanour and
attitude are at once courteous and gracious
then you may reasonably hxpect that man to be
of an agreeable disposition. The regular use of

man is too frequently misjudged. He is often
thought to be ilhnatured when he is simply
suffering from a disordered Stomach or Liver.

“ The Minister for Lands stated in the Legislative
Assembly last evening that experiments for the
eradication of prickly pear had been recently carried
out on the Scene temporary common under the
supervision of the Government Botanist. The ex-
periments included spraying by means of a Tyree
machine with arsenical solution of varying strengths
on different plots of land in the same locality. The
solutions were also injected into the top parts of the
plants and into the. bulbs below ground. Where the
bulbs were treated it was found that the plants died.”
