HIS BOOKS
If Hitlerism Came to Sydney
Colonel Campbell, of the New Guard,
hinted in a recent speech that something
analogous to Hitlerism might appear in
N. S. Wales. Professor Roberts, who
spoke at about the same time, paid
Australians the compliment of thinking
they were too enlightened for it.
Fascism is an isolated movement for people
vyho will not use the spirit of democracy. It
is simply an admission of retrogression, that
people who have been given democratic forms
of government cannot use them.
There is significance in the fact that
the European nations which have sub-
mitted to dictatorships have never learned
to laugh at their rulers. It is easy for
people to take Hitler seriously who didn’t
see anything comic in the Kaiser. Before
an Australian Hitler is able to establish
himself he will have to eliminate a pheno-
menon which has kept our local Stalins'
and Lenins relatively mute and inglori-
ous for the past 15 years—the barracker,
the Man on the Hill. Another essen-
tial is a grievance. Not the ill-feeling
caused by sectional squabbles but rage
on the national scale, inspired by bitter
injustice and the dread of worse to come,
as when the Russian masses rebelled
against Czarism and the Italian middle-
classes rebelled against Bolshevism.
Intolerable Wrongs
W. H. Dawson, author of Germany
Under the Treaty (Allen and Unwin;
10s. 6d.), is probably the greatest autho-
rity on Germany now writing in Eng-
lish ; certainly he is the best-informed
of Germany’s sympathisers. The con-
fessed object of his book is to show that
the Germans were justified, after the
Treaty of Versailles, in turning to revolu-
tion, to debt-repudiation, and finally to
Hitlerism in their desperation.
The annexations were permitted on the
assumption that Germany was alone to
blame for the war. Mr. Dawson devotes
a sober, closely-reasoned chapter to the
Polish Corridor (“There,” said Marshal
Foch, “lies the root of the next war”),
and another to the ruin of Danzig. In
Upper Silesia, which has gone to the
Pdles, in Hultschin (to Czecho-Slo-
vakia), in Memel (to Lithuania), and
elsewhere, millions of Germans are under
the rule of their cultural inferiors ; they
know it and their rulers know it. The
Germans got no chance to state their
case against these partitions in 1918, and
now longi temporis possessio has entered
into the matter, and the justice or other-
wise of their case has become irrelevant.
Hence Hitler.
Genesis of Hitler
Joseph King’s The German Revolu-
tion: Its Meaning and Menace (Williams
and Norgate ; 3s. 6d.) is largely a study
of Hitler. Like all dictators, he supplied
a demand. He is insignificant, almost
absurd, in appearance, he has a
provincial accent and his speeches are
“of little intellectual or political con-
tents, mostly a simple theme with end-
less variations.” But he is a master of
denunciation, and denunciation is what
Germany wants just now. His favorite
subjects are the Versailles Treaty and
Jews. His anti-Semitism is sincere.
When in 1906 he .went to Vienna, he was
disgusted and indignant with the gay dissipation
and strange Jewish element in the luxurious
cosmopolitan city. He accepted the socialistic
aims and the anti-Semite bitterness of the
Christian-Socialist Party.
Anti-Semitism has been steadily increas-
ing in Germany since the Armistice.
Every kind of charge has been made
against the Jews, and mainly of profiteer-
ing and of pacifist and Soviet sympathies.
Prominent Jewish financiers were in-
volved in the scandals of the inflation
period, and Germany acquired a num-
ber of refugee Russian and Polish Jews
during the war and after it—a type of
immigrant that has never been welcomed
by any country.
The first requirement of every poli-
tical adventurer is some institution, class,
religion or race
whom he can exe-
crate as a public
menace. If his
hearers are suffi-
ciently emotional
and gullible they
will often sign away their liberties under
the spell of his ravings, A study of
almost any of Hitler’s reported speeches,
or of one of the propaganda pamphlets
issued by the Goebbels Publicity Depart-
ment, discloses that his dictatorship is
based on the theory that Jews
how responsible for the Versailles Treaty,
and that but for them it might be re-
vised.
Back to the Dark Ages
W. P. Goodwin has written a pamphlet
The Jews and Germany (Stead’s Review ;
Is.) which is interesting both as an
interpretation of Hitlerism and as an
exposition of the Australian attitude to-
wards dictatorships. Briefly his point is
that the Germans, for all their intelli-
gence and high culture, are still medie-
valists at heart. At the time of the
Crusaders Christianity was a patriotism,
and orthodox Jews were ipso facto what
modern Empire men would call dis-
loyalists. The Reformation promised
much but performed little.
Even Luther, who had begun by defending
the Jews, ended by completely changing his
front. “If the Jews refuse to be converted,’’
he wrote, “we ought not to suffer them or
bear with them any longer.”
Not till after the French Revolution,
which destroyed feudalism and the tem-
poral power of the Church in France,
and gave the old order in every country
to understand that its end was near, did
the Jews come into their own. The mech-
anical age and the development of credit
filled the world with Jewish millionaires ;
and in some countries, such as England,
distinguished Jews were taken to the
people’s hearts.
It is odd that insular Britain should
always have been the international among
the nations. The English have their
weaknesses, but, take them for all in
'all,' they are the most civilised people
in the world to-day. The Germans, de-
spite their many splendid moral and in-
tellectual qualities, are always liable to
“relapse into the intolerance and super-
stition of the Middle Ages.”
This was only too well demonstrated by their
submission to the domination of an imperial
family, steeped in mediaeval theories, long after
their neighbors had embraced political freedom
and democratic ideals.
Mr. Goodwin wrote his pamphlet be-
fore some of the more fantastic methods
of Jew-baiting had been devised. They
confirm his view that in many respects
Germany has gone back centuries for
its ideas. 1 The lugubrious humor of pri-
mitive minds is evident in all kinds of
clownish punishments—forcing heretics to
shake hands with pigs, for example. The
revival of the headsman’s block is in
itself a reversion to barbarism. The only
people who can be got to take such
archaisms seriously are those who have
no trouble in keeping straight faces while
spellbinders like Hitler and Mussolini
are functioning. In this country Europe’s
Men of Destiny often cause sniggers
when they appear on movie screens. In
the flesh they would be a riot. u

A Voice from the Past
“Cauboy” writes (R.P. 9/8/’33) that
he is “inclined to agree with Will Dyson,”
who once remarked to him that “the
cinema was really a folk-theatre.”
Charlie Chaplin is the one artist who has
thoroughly understood the cinema medium.
The only emotion he portrays is the simple
self-pitying little man, the child-like adult.
The screen can never “give a colorable
illusion of real life.”
I have heard Will Dyson make some
obvious remarks in my time (who isn’t
guilty of them now and then?), but never
anything so in&ne in its bogus profundity
as the one attributed to him by “Cau-
boy.” Of course the cinema is a folk-
theatre—as much so as “The Bohemi-
ans’ ” tent-dramas were 30 years ago.
When Dyson was last in Melbourne
sound films hadn’t arrived, yet 24 million

DOUBLE EDGED
MADE IN ENGLAND
folk in Australia alone were buying
cinema seats every year.
There are few simple peasants left to
indulge in the old folk-songs and folk-
dances. The modern peasant is the
product of a newspaper-reading, radio-
owning age ; he jazzes, hums something
catchy like “O Sole Mio,” and attends the
movies. National folk-theatres are
almost extinct. I heard the Sicilian
Players in London some years ago, but
in Palermo I found the inhabitants
crowding to the cinema. It has become
the folk-theatre of the world.
There is no esoteric significance in
Charlie Chaplin’s fidelity to wistful clown
parts. He sticks to his formula —the Pag-
iiacci formula —because it is the only one
that suits him. He derives from London
masters of futility —Dan Leno, in such
songs as “The Shopwalker”; Penley
(“The Private Secretary”); Weedon Gros-
smith (“A Dress Rehearsal”) and half a
dozen more who will occur to anyone
with knowledge of the English stage.
Chaplin isn’t “by common consent the
one artist who has thoroughly understood
the cinema medium.” That is what mem-
bers of the Chelsea Arts Club were
saying about him 20 years ago. Others
have appeared since then with a full
understanding of the cinema medium.
Valentino, for example. He proved it,
and also the capacity even of the silent
film to convey a poignant illusion of life
by leaving mourning females all over
the world when he died. Hollywood
hasn’t a monopoly of movie know-
ledge. Eisenstein, Lubitsch, Rene Clair,
Mamoulian, a Russian, a German, a
Frenchman and an Armenian, know
more about the cinema than Chaplin
ever did. Chaplin knows so little of
the modern cinema idiom that he hasn’t
risked his reputation with the old-timers
by making or directing a single picture
in it.
The movies happened to arrive when
the stage was moribund as a theatre for
the masses. It was only being kept alive,
outside a few great cities, by musical
comedy and revue. Its chief defect was
that it didn’t “give a colorable illusion of
real life.” Who that lived in the
Edwardian age, or earlier, can forget the
war dramas, with their dozen or twenty
redcoats, representing the embattled
might of Empire, marching in and out of
a fort whose walls shook at their tread,
and slaughtering Christy Minstrel niggers
while the hero delivered orations of in-
tolerable length which were given rounds
of applause at the end—tributes to the
actor’s powers of memory rather than to
his usually rotten acting? It was nothing
like life, and a time arrived when situa-
tions that had moved a less sophisticated
generation to tears began to cause snig-
gers.
The cinema gives a startling illusion of
life. War films, for example, show those
who have seen active service what they
saw and heard in the line—a thing no
stage battle has ever done —and they
have brought home to millions who never
saw a battle what war is like.
Two characteristics —apart from real-
ism and superb acting—account for the
popularity of the cinema. It is as vul-
garly, earthily, alive and of its period as
the Restoration theatre was, and it has
widened horizons. As fast as anything
dramatic happens—a dirigible crash at
the Pole, a campaign against gangsters,
a financial crisis, a European movement
in favor of republicanism or monarch-
ism—the cinema dramatises it, At this
moment Russian films are dramatising
the Five-year Plan, and German films
are dramatising Hitlerism. The films
have substituted the common or folk
touch for the Mayfair-Faubourg-Saint-
Germain touch which still characterises
four stage plays out of five.
Stage plays may survive, but it can
only be as morality plays and four-in-
hand coaches have survived. The masses
will never crowd to them again.
J.D.
Refrigerated History
The M.L. volume of The Cambridge
History of the British Empire, Volume
VII, Part 2 (Cambridge University Press ;
155.), is the work of 13 authors, each of
whom is an expert in his department.
Four editors, including a Maoriland
advisor—Hight, Rector of Canterbury
College—have collated the sections and
chased the wasted word, the split infini-
tive and the elusive touch of humor
through the pages. The result is a per-
fect series of encyclopaedia articles, but
the method seems to have robbed the
story of much of its natural greatness
and the characters of some of their
human charm.
Two hundred and fifty-six pages of
almost unadulterated and, unadorned
active voice is a performance rare since
the days of Shakspieare; but it is a fear-
some one, too, and the reader is a little
glad when it terminates in a forest of
italicised bibliography, a course which
has not been smirched by a single color-
ful adjective or touch of levity.
Yet the early days of Maoriland were
inspiring and turbulent days, full of head-
lopping barbarians, wicked whalers and
amazing adventurer-missionaries, while
the transition periods which followed,
before and after the Maori wars, were
peopled by a generation of pioneers as
hardy and daring intellectually as their
forerunners had been physically. It seems
to have been the happy fate of the “new
England of the South” to have had sons
who cut themselves adrift from precedent
when they left the shores of Europe and
applied great abilities to new problems
in the most original ways:
The early colonists were selected men, some
of their leaders already coming into notice at
home, highly educated, of ripe experience in
affairs yet intensely idealistic. The debates of
the first decades of the Parliament are unique
amongst colonial debates for their eloquence,
breadth of view, political knowledge and in-
sight, loftiness of aim and dialectic power.
The Wakefields and the Greys gave place
to a succession of solid but pawky ideal-
ists. Now and then a Vogel drifts by
looking a little like a peacock in a kirk ;
but you feel as you read that neither he
nor the Bayards of the petty wars of
the ’sixties are the stuff of which farther
antipodean history is made. The genius
which assimilated the wild Maori into
an Aryan polity and transformed him
from a bloody raider into a muddy All
Black or mild K.B.E. was Commonsense.
So the authors of the Cambridge His-
tory are able to delight in characters
like John Mackenzie, “in appearance and
outlook a typical Highland crofter,”
whose policy as Minister for Lands was
dominated for seven years by a passion-
ate love of the small-farmer interest and
a hatred of the big landowner. Of W.
Pember Reeves they say:
It is in some ways unfortunate for his own
reputation as a statesman that his modesty, no
less than his capacity as an author, should have
veiled to a great extent the importance of his
share in the legislation he describes so well.
This is the legislation which became
the Magna Charta of the wage-earner in
the Southern Hemisphere, and the seed
of nearly all the best of our conciliation
and basic-wage systems.
The book is a fine plot for the student
to dig. It should be a boon to the his-
torical novelist, and to the social analyst
who likes his events and personalities
isolated and stripped of the offal of
opinion so that he may judge them in
the raw.

Burkmanism
Burkmanism (R.P. 19/4/’33) has many
friends as well as critics. A. J. Russell,
literary editor of a leading London daily,
recounts some amazing experiences in
“For Sinners Only.” He scouts the idea
that the Group Movement is made up of
emotional or frustrated people; the
Group members meet to discuss their
experiences with a view to helping one
another. This is but a return to a prac-
tice common in the first century of the
Christian religion, and one which, I ven-
ture a guess, has never been wholly
absent since. Probably the Wesleys fol-
lowed the same line in the Holy Club
at Oxford —certainly it was strongly
established in the church they founded.
“C.Q.” is wrong in stating that the
cult concentrates on sexual matters. It
would be strange if there were not some
mention of sex in their discussions. But Mr.
Russell remarks : “Though I have attended
hundreds of meetings, I do not remember
hearing anything in bad taste.” He credits
the Group Movement with translating
the theories of religion into practice, and
speaks of them at Oxford and elsewhere
(for the Movement is not confined to
Oxford) as the “most extraordinary asso-
ciation of Christian adventurers since the
first century.”
Such is the verdict of a man of the
world who was drawn into investigation
for the purpose of assessing the news
value to his paper of what was going on.
After all, it is surely as sensible for
people experimenting with life and living
to discuss their problems and experiences
as for a company of doctors or scientists
to confer.

An Australian Wife
The heroine of She Dresses for Dinner
(Skeffington; 7s. 6d.), Georgia Rivers’s
latest novel, is a Melbourne girl who de-
cides on her wedding eve to make an art
of marriage. Her husband is a returned
soldier whose lungs have suffered in the
trenches.
Val becomes a wife that any man
ought to be satisfied with, but 14 months
after the honeymoon her husband con-
fesses that he has been unfaithful.
She rallies and resumes her self-
appointed job of matrimonial artist.
She herself, however, now 'falls in love
with her husband’s employer, who, hav-
ing revealed his passion, nobly drives out
of the story. In the succeeding years
Val goes on with her uncompleted pic-
ture of the perfect marriage, but her
brush is hampered with a bad conscience.
A catastrophic event solves her problem.
Her husband takes a drink which goes
down the wrong way and brings about a
fit of coughing. Val thinks his lung
trouble has returned —result, reconcilia-
tion and a reversion to the ecstatic rela-
tions of the honeymoon.
The story is told in the nervous style
which distinguished Miss Rivers’s earlier
books, and has all her talent for sensitive
description. It is a pity that all this
charm and skill are expended in the
demonstration of an erroneous notion of
sexual psychology. Long-married people
don’t revive their initial ardors in the
manner Miss Rivers imagines, except in
the realm of romantic fiction. Miss
Rivers has the technical equipment for
doing something more realistic.

A Satchel of Books
Guide to Sydney (N.S.W. Bookstall
Co., Ltd., Sydney ; Is. 6d.) is a pocket-
size reference work which will be useful
to those who want: to find their way
around the Empire’s third largest city.
The maps are excellent.
Mr. Neverlost, by A. Turnbull, and
The Exploits of the Chalet Girls, by
Elinor Brent Dyer (a further examina-
tion of the doings of these adventurous
English maidens), are the latest Chambers
publications for children. They cost 3s.
6d. each, are illustrated and have plenty
of laughs.
Heinemann has republished Norman
Angell’s “The Great Illusion” in a revised
form at 6s. as The Great Illusion, 1933.
A popular illusion concerning the origi-
nal pamphlet is that it was written to
prove that war had become impossible.
The author rebuts this idea with con-
siderable vigor. He is striving for peace,
as he was quarter of a century ago,
because he believes that war is always
imminent.
Man’s Understanding (Ward Lock; 7s.
6d.) consists of 16 excellent yarns by
C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne. Several of the best
are about the sea, which is the author’s
native element in a literary sense. Others
are about foreign parts ; and few write
better about the world s out-of-the-way
corners than the cieator of Captain
Kettle.” Great value for the money.
The Dog: Its Ailments and Diseases,
by B. A. McMichan (Angus and Robert-
son ; 4s. 6d.), contains practically every-
thing that a N. S. Wales owner should
know in order to keep his dog in health,
and save him when ill-health arrives,
There are an admirable chapter on the
nursing of a sick dog, some first-rate
photographs and—most useful of all per-
haps to residents in many parts of Aus-
tralia—a section on tick paralysis by Dr.
Stewart McKay, who has made a life-
study of the subject,
Hyde Side Up, by Ben Travers
Head; 7s. 6d.), is “Plunder” in novel-
form. Mr. Travers is like P. G. Wode-
house, yet he is himself, a separate en-
tity and an original. In this amusing
b oo k his monocled moron-hero, wise
httle heroine and criminal old public-
school boy behave and talk like Wode-
house characters, but they are presented
differently. The fact is Mr. Wode-
house has what moralists call “a nice
mind” and Mr. Travers hasn’t. He never
misses a chance to set the smoking-room
j n a roar. The jewel robbery and murder
don’t go with such light-hearted verve
in the book as they did in the play and
film; but the closing pages, in which
poetic justice is done, provide an ending
which is almost plausible.
Pilgrim College, by Cecil Roberts
(Hodder and Stoughton; Dymock ; 7s.
gd.), has two contrasting themes. The
fi rs (- j s {fi e old-world loveliness and peace
Q f some parts of England. Pilgrim Cot-
tage, which Mrs. Cressington, of the
U.S.A., buys and gives to the hero and
heroine on condition that they desist
from living in sin and settle in it as a
married couple, is lovely in the picture-
postcard manner. The second half of
the book concerns Soviet Russia and its
horrors. The writer is no crude anti-
Bolshevik propagandist, and he obviously
writes from first-hand experience. He
shows a society of idealists which is
going bourgeois from the top. Several
of the people whom Ann, the heroine,
meets when she goes to Moscow to help
train Imogen Barrett’s ballet are obvi-
ously drawn from life. Imogen herself,
for example. A notable novel in spite
of its lack of unity and the sentimen-
tality of its happy ending.

FIFTY PER CENT. OFF.
Ernest Field, of the N. S. Wales
Farmers and Settlers, was severely
banged by Sydney’s “Morning Herald” for
some of the remarks he made in his
presidential address at their annual con-
ference. Fie defended himself with vigor,
but certain of his observations needed
no defence. He said that Australia
would have to adjust itself to a period
of world prices far below those to which
it grew accustomed in the nineteen-
twenties, and that the men on the land
were prepared to do their part. But they
would not be content to go on listening
to political platitudes ; the rulers of the
country would have to come out with
“a definite programme of action,” de-
signed to “stabilise employment and in-
dustry,” instead of shutting their eyes
to unpleasant facts.
“For four years now,” the F. and S. A.
man said, “the Commonwealth and State
Governments have been pursuing a wait-
ing policy” ; and so they have. They
have been waiting for prices to go back
to 1928 levels, and meanwhile taxing
everyone and everything in sight. The
Scullin Government did not begin to
reduce the cost of the bloated Common-
wealth establishment until Robert Gib-
son bluntly told it that it would
have to choose between that and
payment of salaries and pensions at
the rate of 12s. in the £. Before
the administrative cuts were forced
on it, it had subjected the community to
taxes which, along with those of the State
Governments, outdid anything of the
kind which any other country has had
to bear, even a country invaded by an
enemy. In the main, its successors have
continued this extortion, and State taxes
have gone up everywhere.
In the first year of the war the British
income tax was Is. Bd. in the £ ; in the
second year it was increased to 3s. The
present Commonwealth income tax rises
to 9s. 6d. in the £ on property income
in excess of £3700, and on personal in-
come in excess of £6900. N. S. Wales
State income tax goes up to ss. in the
£ less 5 per cent., which rate is charged
on personal income in excess of £7OOO
and property income in excess of £5500.
N. S. Wales unemployed-relief tax is Is.
in the £ on gross income from employ-
ment, and the same on “net assessable
income” from other sources ; it is levied
on income derived by residents from
other States, although that income is sub-
ject to Commonwealth income tax and
State income and unemployed-relief
taxes there. Queensland State income
and unemployed-relief taxes soar to 6s.
in the £, plus a super tax of 20 p.c.
Then there are a Commonwealth sales
tax of 6 per cent.; and a Commonwealth
land tax, which went to 9d. in the £ of
“taxable value” till a 10 per cent, reduc-
tion was allowed, then one of 33 1-3 per
cent.; and State land taxes in Victoria,
Queensland, South Aus., Westralia, Tas-
mania and the western division of N. S.
Wales. And there is in N. S. Wales a
family-endowment tax of sd. in the £
“on all salaries, wages, etc.,” the idea
being that the more persons a man em-
ploys and the more he pays them, the
more he should be punished.
These crude and savage taxes are
plainly retarding the recovery of the
nation. They are preventing the reduc-
tion of interest rates, preventing the
payment of dividends, preventing the
expansion of businesses which should
normally be expanding with the popu-
lation. They are stifling enterprise by
producing the feeling that it is little
use sowing when seven greedy Govern-
ments, represented by an army of tax-
gatherers, will grab so much of the har-
vest. They are inflating the cost of living,
and hence wages and salaries, without
benefit to those who receive the wages
and salaries, and with palpable injury
to those who have to pay the wages and
salaries and the charges based on them.
Above all, this tremendous taxation
stands in the way of re-employing the
vast majority of Australians who are out
of work, and many of whom have been
out of work for three years or more, save
for a few days or weeks of shovelling
sand, chipping weeds off footpaths or
cutting down trees for some stupid Gov-
ernment.
Nothing would put greater heart into
the nation than a sweeping reduction of
taxes ; and it is a policy which will have
to be adopted or things may get worse
instead of better, especially if drought
arrives. The Commonwealth Govern-
ment confessed that it was overtaxing
the people by withholding a large pro-
portion of its income-tax assessments
until the financial year had expired ;
even then it wound up the year with a
surplus of £3,545,000. It is now toying
with proposals for taking something off
this impost and something off that; but
a great deal more is required. Nothing
less will suffice than a 50 per cent, reduc-
tion of taxes for at least two years. Fifty
per cent, off all the taxes, Commonwealth
and State, that are burdening industry—
revenue duties of customs and excise,
income, land, sales taxes, unemployed-
relief taxes and the N. S. Wales family-
endowment tax —though it would be
better to abolish that work-reducing im-
post, and with it the Federal land tax,
which has been known to amount to
fourpence a pound on wool sold at less
than the cost of production. It might
be made a statutory condition—in the
Income Tax Acts, at all events —that em-
ployment should be provided to the ex-
tent of the tax-relief vouchsafed, even if
it were only enough for the building of
a fowlhouse. But better results might
flow from a national work-giving cam-
paign without compulsion—the one
feature of the American experiment that
appeals.
Our politicians being what they are,
it would be necessary to borrow for the
purpose, and take the risk of portion of
the loan being misapplied. The money
could be raised by the sale of £5 pre-
mium bonds at a nominal rate of 3j per
cent. —l| per cent, for interest, payable
annually, and 2 j per cent, for redemp-
tion of bonds, with and without prizes, at
monthly drawings. These would com-
bine the lure of the lotteries which are
now infesting the country with an attrac-
tion which none of them can ever offer.
Unless the country went bung, no sub-
scriber would lose a penny, and even
1 per cent, on, say, £25.000,000 would
a magnificent prize fund.
Repudiation has been tried and found
wanting in some distressed countries, and
inflation of the currency in others. Bleed-
ing the taxpayers white has been tried,
with lamentable results, in Australia. Let
us try taking 50 per cent, off the taxes
for two years.
MERCHANTS OF HATE.
C. M. McDonald, of the N. S. Wales
Employers’ Federation, tried to start a
get-together movement of employers and
employees the other day, and the organ
of the Lang party lost no time in throw-
ing spanners into the machinery of
goodwill. The paper argued that it was
useless for employers to talk about
friendliness to the workers unless they
were prepared to advocate a Roosevelt
dictatorship for Australia.
The Australian Constitution was de-
vised, among other things, to make dic-
tatorships on the national scale impos-
sible. Roosevelt’s policy may be right
or wrong, but in any case Australia
can’t experiment with it unless it has a
revolution. In this matter, as in so many
others, Lang Labor imitates the tactics
of the Soviet Government, which offered
some years ago to abolish all armies,
navies and air forces if the rest of the
world would do the same. The proposal
was safe, since no European Power can
afford to disarm completely, and when it
was duly turned down the Soviet rulers
were able to inflame the Russian masses
with sensational speeches and newspaper
articles about the bloodthirsty intentions
of their alleged enemies.
The first rule of the hate-merchant is
to put the other side in the wrong, how-
ever right its intentions may be, and to
use the new situation to excite more pre-
judice. When the masses have been stirred
up to the requisite degree of fury, strikes,
riots, wars, revolutions follow, to the ruin
of almost everybody, and particularly to
the ruin of the masses. A few adven-
turers are able to make and (more rarely)
keep something out of these upheavals,
but the rule is that after hundreds or
thousands or millions of dupes, as the
case may be, have been killed, starved,
wounded, gaoled, or merely put, with
their families, on the bread-line the old
order returns.
It is 15 years since the World War
ended, and no one can say definitely
who is to blame for it, or why it was
begun. The only certainties are that,
owing to the hatred campaigns carried
on in every European country, a stage
was reached at which war became
inevitable, and that no belligerent nation
made anything out of it. France hasn’t
even got security, and America hasn’t
even got cash. Nearly nine million men,
the cream of their generation, were killed,
nearly 21 million were wounded, an in-
calculable amount of money went up in
smoke —more than is represented by all
the visible gold on earth —and the only
effect has been to present the hate-
mongers with even more promising
material to start another world war with
than they possessed in 1914.
Humanity’s one hope of being saved
from further horrors, and possible self-
destruction, is that those at the head of
affairs in every great country —not ex-
cepting remote and heavily-armed Japan
—now know enough about war on the
world scale to be terrified of it.
Vet the preaching of internal class
hatreds is commoner than ever. In
Italy and Germany it has led to
Fascist tyrannies and appalling injustices
to Liberals, Socialists, Jews and others.
In England and Australia the leaders of
Minority Movements, Inner Groups and
the like are behaving as European poli-
ticians did before the war, and as agi-
tators did in Italy and Germany before
the dictators took charge. Irreconcila-
bility is their slogan; they refuse to
consider getting together with the so-
called .enemies of their class, and they
can’t stay together among themselves for
long.
These wild men live politically on
promises that if one half of the nation
will only learn to hate the other half
with sufficient intensity capitalism will
be overthrown, and all kinds of benefits
will accrue to the poor. Their promises
are self-evident lies. If a miracle hap-
pened and the socialisers subdued their
propertied opponents and started a
Soviet system here, they would be think-
ing of ways and means to turn it into
a capitalistic system before the blood
was dry. It happened in Russia, and it
has happened in every other country that
has tried their nostrum. The only change
would be a change of hatreds —hatred
of the outside world and its customs and
religions as a substitute for hatred of
a section of their fellow-citizens.
The traffic in hatred sometimes pays
the vendors, but the deluded purchasers
never get anything but misery from it
in the long run.
THE RIVERINA AND AFTER.
If Mr. Stevens believes that he can shelve
the New State movement by merely
appointing another legal commissioner to
inquire about it, he will be disillusioned.
It will take more than horsehair and
sympathy to satisfy the Riverina, which
is preparing to demand, through Mr.
Stevens’s emissary from Sydney, local self-
governing rights over a territory 81,210
square miles in extent —6000 square miles
less in size than Victoria. The area has
the Murray for one boundary; it ex-
tends to a line, drawn raggedly along
natural features, from just north of Wol-
longong on the coast to just north of
Hillston; thence it reaches the S.A.
border. It holds more than 250,000
people. It embraces more than 50 p.c. of
the cultivated land in N. S. Wales, the
most valuable rivers, the most popular
holiday resorts outside the Blue Moun-
tains and the beaches, and the pick of
the stud sheep and dairy cattle, as well
as two of the best undeveloped harbors
on the continent.
The loss of such a taxation field is
something which no accountant Premier
could contemplate without a shiver; and
that is not all. Fourteen solid U.A.P.
and U.C.P. members represent it. For
Stevens to part with their constituencies
would be equivalent to his Government
committing political hara-kiri and hand-
ing over the territory north of the Mur-
rumbidgee boundary-line to Garden and
his friends. Then, of course, northern
districts would not be long in getting
out, and N. S. Wales would become a
sandwich —Lang caviare in the centre,
smelling strongly of Russia, and two
outer layers of self-governing graziers,
dairy-farmers and wheat men holding
their affronted noses.
Nevertheless, if Stevens looks forward
with misgiving to such possibilities, Lang
equally fears the creation of States with
power to manage their own concerns, and
with electors who regard Langism as a
bad smell and socialisation as a sort
of civic strychnine. Scullin on this point
is at one with Lang. The Scullin and
Lang groups believe that their immedi-
ate goal of socialisation can be attained
only when they achieve Commonwealth
power and have their talons on the Com-
monwealth Bank. They have lost faith
in the future of the States. They see
them merely as impediments in the way
of a dictatorship of the proletariat.
A year ago Lang was the arch-advo-
cate of State rights. But he wrote early
in 1933 that he and his friends “must
obtain control of both Houses of the
Federal Parliament,” and “must go about
developing the six Australian States into
one Australian nation, with unified con-
trol and unified authority.”
Federal Labor has been unificationist
since the Perth A.L.P. Conference of
June, 1918. Then T. J. Ryan, who
during the conscription business had
posed as a last-ditch defender of “the
sovereign powers of his Majesty’s sove-
reign State of Queensland,” joined with
Scullin, Theodore and Frank Tudor in
advocacy of an alteration of the Common-
wealth Constitution to provide for 31 pro-
vinces and a one-House Federal Legisla-
ture of 100 members. It was designed to
give Labor permanent control of all key-
industry districts. To this plan the group
is still pledged.
Nothing can be done by supporters or
opponents of subdivision without the
consent of the electors, who are always
cautious when it comes to vital Constitu-
tional changes. But the time has gone
by when subdivision of unwieldy States
could be treated as something remote,
like Gabriel’s trump. It is coming, and
no man can stop it. The prestige of
existing States has sunk lower and lower.
It is the duty of the Governments in
power to face the issue and try to corf-
trive an enduring national adjustment, one
that will give to dissatisfied communi-
ties the right of local self-government
and promote closer union in national
matters, together with the complete separ-
ation of the powers of the Common-
wealth and the States. It is better that
the job should be tackled now than that
any shilly-shallying should leave it for
Scullin, with Lang hanging on his arm,
to do the planning if opportunity offers
later on.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Defence in Homoeopathic Doses.
Despite an almost continual series of
disarmament palavers since 1919 the
world is spending at least twice as much
on warlike preparations as it spent in
1914. The forces available are, it is true,
smaller in numbers, less in bulk —but they
are immeasurably more lethal. Europe
to-day looks more like a powder-maga-
zine than it did at the beginning of 1914.
Recently, and very belatedly, thoughts
of home defence have flitted across the
minds of the rulers of the Common-
wealth. W. M. Hughes, who delivered
the first blow at the R.A.N. and helped
to bring in the Government that abol-
ished compulsory military training, has
discovered that Australia can. no longer
thank God it has a navy, nor can it de-
pend upon a predominant British Navy.
The R.A.N. and the C.M.F. are pale
shadows of what they were; the
R.A.A.F. is pottering about with obsolete
’planes.
So it has been decided to do something
about it. The something is preluded by
the revelation that our coast-defence bat-
teries, old-fashioned 9.2 guns, have a
range of only 9000 yards. It is pro-
posed to replace these relics with guns of
the same calibre, but more than three
times the range, in modern mountings, at
a cost of £200,000. This, it is stated, will
provide artillery defence for Sydney,
Newcastle and Fremantle.
Only one other country discusses in pub-
lic the details of its coast defences, and
that’s the U.S.A. The republic breaks the
customary reticence on such matters in
respect to its Panama Canal defences,
which consist of very extensive batteries
of the latest 16-inch battleship guns—•
the very biggest, longest-ranged and most
efficient that American arsenals can sup-
ply. Why the defence of Australia’s
greatest port and of its western door
should be considered amply provided for
by installing small-bore cruiser guns is
not explained.
Also there is a mild little proposal to
give members of our tiny “cadre” of
officers a bit of training in India. The
programme is rounded off with a sort
of promise that one or two anti-aircraft
guns may be obtained.
This is only playing at national defence.
What Australia needs is the restoration
of the R.A.N. to the 1914 standard of
personnel, armament and efficiency; the
reconstruction of the C.M.F. on the basis
of compulsory training, extended to
country districts; the extension and re-
equipment of the Air Force, and the
secret installation of adequate coastal
defences in the neighborhood of vulner-
able ports.


Minister Marr Economises.
Queensland’s branch of the B.M.A. is
in holds with Canberra. The Common-
wealth Government has closed the
Institute of Tropical Diseases at Towns-
ville ; it has wiped out the Division of
Tropical Hygiene, abandoned the hook-
worm and minor tropical campaigns.
Occupation of North Australia by whites
is largely a medical problem, the B.M.A.
branch declares, and it sees in these
measures a virtual withdrawal from the
North.
As usual in such matters, Canberra
finds it difficult to reply. The Director-
General of Health says he has no com-
ment to offer because such matters come
under the Prime Minister’s Department.
The Minister of Health apologises in the
name of economy for the “abolition of
the Division of Tropical Hygiene as an
administrative unit,” but says the work
is being carried out by the Government;
in fact, “the school of public health
and tropical medicine which the Federal
Government maintains at Sydney Univer-
sity is claimed to be one of the world’s
foremost institutions dealing with tropical
research.” Further, the medical service
in New Guinea, now strengthened by
native medical assistants, is regarded “as
in the front rank”; the League of
Nations —whose relevant committee on
the, subject is made up of the Liberian
or Guatemalan delegates and other local
prototypes of Marr—has “made favor-
able comments on it.”
Hanlon, the Queensland Home Secre-
tary, has come into the fray to support
the 8.M.A., and there is no doubt that
he and the association are right. While
Marr and his friends are devoting them-
selves to turning almost illiterate New
Guinea natives into lik lik doctors by
sending them to Sydney University to
study something which they are not in
the least likely to understand, and which
could be done 50 times as well by a
ninth of the number of fully-trained
young Australian medicoes, tropical re-
search is languishing. One good case of
hookworm or malaria brought well home
to Forrest or Ainslie and it would lan-
guish no longer.

The Christina Fraser.
“Nobby’s” writes from Newcastle:
Had seventeen lives been lost in a train or
mine accident or a harbor collision N. S. Wales
would have been plunged in mourning. There
would have been public memorial services, sub-
scription lists and newspaper demands for a
searching inquiry into the cause, particularly if
there were reason to believe that if a simple
and comparatively inexpensive protective device
had been installed the victims might have been
saved.
Seventeen lives were lost in the Christina
Fraser; but I have seen none of the signs of
agitation mentioned. The public has turned to
other topics, and the seventeen men have already
been forgotten, except by their families, and a
few others. There has been precious little news-
paper comment on the finding, which was, in
effect, that nobody was at fault —“no blame
attachable to anyone,” as the coroners’ juries
say. Yet the fact was established that the little
collier carried no wireless; and it is on record
that another lost collier flying the same house-
flag, with which six men went to the bottom,
was without wireless. It is exceedingly strange.
Why was no attempt made to get evidence
from Newcastle? The Christina Fraser had
traded to that port ever since 1925; she
used to average four trips a week. Surely New-
castle navigation inspectors and stevedores would
have been able to submit testimony of value to
the Court.
And why was no inspection made of small
craft carrying coal? The Christina Fraser was
of 717 tons gross; the Bealiba is of 512 tons
gross. One would think that the question of
whether such vessels are suitable for trading
between States would engage the attention of a
Commonwealth Marine Court. The Christina
Fraser was actually on an inter-State voyage
when she was lost. As far as my knowledge
goes the two smallest colliers running in the
inter-State trade are the Oorama, 1051 tons gross,
and Noora, 1072 tons gross. They are owned
by the Adelaide Steamship Co. and both are
fitted with wireless.
Furthermore, no recommendation was made
by the Court as to the use of oil at sea. Yet,
according to the log of Captain Evans, the Blue
Funnel freighter Phemius, caught in a hurricane
in Windward Passage, between Cuba and Haiti,
in November, was saved by crude oil, poured on
the raging waters from five-gallon drums carried
into the forward latrines. “The effect of the oil,”
the skipper wrote, “was almost beyond belief.
Towering seas tearing along direct for our ex-
posed side crumpled up within ten feet.
Although we could not escape them, they landed
on board in heavy volumes of dead water. The
ship would have foundered had the pouring of
oil not been carried on continuously.”
I trust it will be made compulsory, not only
for wireless to be installed in all Australian sea-
going craft, but for a supply of oil to be car-
ried —and bilge oil would do.

Land Values at Canberra.
Nobody in authority is likely to take any
notice of the plaintive voice of Shake-
speare, which was raised at Canberra
to point out that the value of un-
alienated Crown land in the Federal
Territory is assessed at double its true
figure.
Most of the windy place was bought
for £3 10s. per acre. By dint of cutting
it into circles, ovals, parades and high-
ways, stuffing the intervals with trees and
erecting a few forlorn pubs and a Parlia-
ment House that looks like the father of
all cenotaphs, the Government turned it
into a city, to which a population was
dragged, most of the men and some of
the women being Commonwealth em-
ployees.
Then the Government sold a little
land to speculators—a very little indeed,
so that its corner in property would not
be materially affected. Naturally, the
speculators paid tidy sums for the limited
plots offered to them. Thereupon the
Government took its slide rule and cal-
culated that the land which it bought
for £3 10s. per acre was now very largely
worth £BOO per acre. This enabled it to
show in its fashion what a profitable
deal Canberra had been for the nation ;
and there were mugs who believed it.
On portion of the land the Government
built houses for civil servants. These
people have been set down in graded
loneliness: the goats of the lower-paid
sections in the hollows, far from the
temptations of Manuka and even farther
from the pubs ; the merinos on the ex-
clusive highlands; the Prime Minister
(and watchdog) in splendid isolation
above the unemployed camp, en route to
the even more splendid isolation of Yar-
ralumla, where the G.-G. dwells.
Each civil servant has his rent assessed
(and automatically collected) by the Gov-
ernment with due regard to increment in
values. For a cottage that looks like an
Annandale electric sub-station set on half
an acre of unbarbered clay the rent is
20 p.c. to 30 p.c. more than a similar
dwelling costs in Sydney. There are no
bad debts, because the Government is
its own rent-collector ; no complaints, bc-
cause nobody under the rank of Under-
secretary cares to complain unless he is
a private citizen. And when the bath-
room tap falls off, it stays off until form
X 238 /j 17 has been filled in.
Who in Molonglo cares whether a
nationalised tap on land which is £3 10s.
purchase price, plus £796 10s. increment,
is mended or not?

“Beautifying” Yarra’s Banks.
“Lord Luvus” : Melbourne has just
awakened to the fact that the Yarra, its
one natural asset which is comparable
to Sydney Harbor, is in process of being
ruined by what the Board of Works
euphemistically calls its beautification
scheme, namely, removing the forest
cover on the banks, though the danger
was pointed out in The Bulletin long
ago.
The scheme, it was claimed, would
mitigate floods, which it hasn’t done, and
would open the river to navigation as far
as Warrandyte —for a handful of launches
and canoes. Despite the opposition of
farmers, gangs of men proceeded to de-
stroy hundreds of lofty trees. These,
it was contended, would eventually fall
into the stream anyhow. Pollarding
would have prevented it, and the
banks would have been saved. Now,
instead of trees falling into the river,
banks are.
One farmer reports a loss of quarter
of an acre, in places the river is
making new channels for itself, and
even the board’s sister organisation, the
Electricity Department, is a sufferer
through the loss of poles. When a Gov-
ernment -department gets bitten by the
aesthetic bug and starts talking about pre-
serving beauty, disaster is well in sight.
An Ancient Swindle.
When Pompey, Lucullus and others
were robbing the outer barbarians and
handing part of the proceeds to the
Roman electors, a political ramp was in-
stituted which caused popular indigna-
tion even in that corrupt age. Gibbon
has referred in blistering terms to the
intrigues that went on for legation's
liberce —the right granted to Senators by
the Senate of travelling in the pro-
vinces with their secretaries and families
at the taxpayers’ expense.
Democratic politicians always get up
to tricks of the sort. The prin-
ciple of free and luxurious transport for
the breed was long ago adopted in this
country. Restricted at first to the Govern-
ment railways of one colony, it was ex-
tended to the Government railways ot
all the States and the Commonwealth, to
Government tramways, to Government
motor-cars, in some cases to Govern-
ment steamers.
When the war money was rolling in
no one minded much. There was occa-
sional grumbling from overtaxed citi-
zens, but on the whole the regal pageantry
of a Hughes progress round the Com-
monwealth, of a Pearce jaunt to Wash-
ington, or of a Stanley Bruce tour of
the earth was viewed with approval.
Extravagance was fashionable.
Things have changed in the last three
years. No one is well off, a large propor-
tion of the people is unemployed and
taxation is the highest in the world. The
new spirit was indicated at the confer-
ence of the N.S.W. Farmers and Settlers
when a resolution in favor of free passes
being provided for men going to work in
country districts was heavily defeated.
The delegates sympathised with men on
the dole who were anxious to get to jobs
and lacked the money, but they did not
see why the taxpayers, as a body, should
be called on to pay the fares of any one
section.
It is time the politicians of Australia
arrived at the same self-respecting con-
clusion. Mr. Lang’s paper has been
sneering at Premier Stevens’s official rail
car (“railway employees call it ‘Luxury
on Wheels,’ and it costs 2s. a mile to
haul”), and there is a lot in its sneers.
There is no reason, except ancient and
rotten political tradition, why a State
Premier shouldn’t travel in an ordinary
railway carriage. The size of the Minis-
terial car fleet and the manner in which
cars had been used have been a public
scandal for years. One N. S. Wales Pre-
mier’s wife did her shopping and paid
her social calls in a Ministerial sedan.
Mr. Stevens and his Ministers have a
splendid opportunity to practise in this
connection the economy they are always
preaching. If they cut down their col-
lective automobile bill by half, put an em-
bargo on superfluous jaunts to the coun-
try and started a practice of travelling
in reserved compartments instead of
special cars they would save the tax-
payers considerable sums. More im-
portant still, they would establish a pre-
cedent that would save taxpayers money
all over Australia. The moral effect
would be great.

A Word for Democracy.
“Hyram”: Let me speak a few words
over the litter whereon lies poor
Democracy. I come to praise him, not
to bury him, knowing from long experi-
ence that he’s immortal. Whence come
the title-deeds of authority? Either from
a deity (an origin so arguable that in a
world with unpleasant memories of
Stuarts and Borgias it is no longer
argued) or from possession of force
powerful enough to establish and main-
tain sovereignty.
It is quite on the cards in these days
of scientific marvels that some individual
holds a recipe for poisoning the entire
terrestrial atmosphere. If he were inclined
to assume the job of governing the world
he could have it any time he wanted it.
He’d only need to make his threat good
once, after which he and his adherents,
equipped with the right sort of gas-
masks, would be the only denizens of
the planet.
Yet force, while a good practical basis
of government, hasn’t demonstrably
any more to do with good government
than haddocks have to do with the man
in the moon. Reflections such as these
have passed over the minds of men when-
ever they were oppressed by a thumping
bad Government, and such phrases as
“government by consent of the governed”
and “government of the people, by the
people, for the people” have suggested
themselves as formulae for a more intel-
ligent ordering of the affairs of human
society.
But —and here I am very heartily on
the side of The Bulletin’s consistent
attitude on this subject—it was not in
the mind of any of the great rebels
against a physical tyranny that the right
of choosing rulers should be conferred
upon the mentally incompetent; up<
outlanders hostile to the State in which
they lived, or upon those known to be
anxious to corrupt the constitutional
forms of civil government with the object
of imposing an undemocratic tyranny. I
am afraid that the fault of us Austra-
lians as a nation is not that we are too
democratic, but that we are too lazy,
politically, to rebuke little Caesars who
have no love for democracy. Impose
an intelligence test and a loyalty test
on electors and notice who squeals. There
stand the enemies of democracy!

Disorderly Marketing.
Some may regret the impending demise
of the Empire Marketing Board, which
is departing this life next month because
it has shown the British Government no
adequate return for the £500,000 a year
it has cost. No Australian taxpayer would
mourn if the many official marketing
authorities which are “helping” the Aus-
tralian producer disappeared with it.
The Commonwealth Government
spends just on £300,000 a year on its
Markets Department (a percentage goes
on grading of produce), besides keeping
up Australia House. All the States sup-
port Agents-General (certainly there are
vacancies in a couple of offices), though
borrowing, which used to be their prin-
cipal function, is now a Commonwealth
matter. What does Australia get for all
this expenditure?
The official propagandists certainly do
nothing for the butter trade; the Aus-
tralian co-operative concerns look after
that. They mean nothing to the wool
trade. And every statistical line of fruit-
trade records condemns them.
Foreign countries in 1932 supplied more
than half the apples imported into the
U.K. Though the exchange was adverse
the U.S.A. sent nearly twice the quantity
which came from Australia. South
Africa has a British market for 21 vari-
eties of deciduous fruits, most of which
grow in profusion in Australia and are
quite exportable. What do we send ex-
cept apples and pears? There is a market
in Britain for 781,000 cwt. of grapefruit;
Australia does not fill an ounce of it.
There is a lemon market which foreign
countries monopolise to the extent of
1,430,000 cwt. out of 1,447,000 cwt. And
Britain gets most of its oranges from
Jaffa, though we can grow a better fruit
and export it in at least equal condition.
And what’s wrong with our pineapples
that, while South Africa can compete in
Britain with foreigners and sell
7,900,000 cwt., we didn’t supply a single
one out of the total import of
67,752,000 cwt.? Why is it that Holland
sells to our Old Man just over 100 times
as much unsugared preserved fruit as
we do? What help has Australia got
from its army of marketing officials in
any of these directions?
Marketing Boards and Government
propagandists market only one com-
modity successfully—themselves. They
are wonders at getting jobs, but dead
failures at extending trade. They could
well be dispensed with, the job being left
to private enterprise and to the ports.
Glasgow pays a trade-development man-
ager a couple of thousand a year to
attract business. London, Manchester,
Liverpool, Bristol, Hull are all compet-
ing for trade. There is not one of them
that would not jump at a chance to heln
the marketing i of Australian produce if
the cloud of: Australian officials got out
of each other’s way and out of theirs.
OUT OF THE NORTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Out of the North a cloud,
Blotting the light of day;.
Out of the cloud a wind,
Whirling sweet Peace away.
Out of the wind a voice—
And hear it all men must,
For clarion-clear it peals:
“Be strong —or pass to dust.”
As winter on summer treads
And night succeeds to dawn,
So sure is the law that gifts
Neglected are withdrawn. -
To sc,off at Duty’s call
None may unpunished choosfc.
It is decreed that man
Must manhood use —or lose.
Out of the North in arms
Our ancestors of yore
Sighted the Viking ships,
As Counts of the Saxon Shore.
Back to the North they hurled
The Berserkers at speed:
Runs Wessex blood no more
In the veins of the doughty breed?
:jc s*€ :!?
Glad welcome ’neath its spangled sky
The blue Pacific smiled,
As marching hosts long since drew nigh
Of migrant tribesmen wild.
On Asia’s coast leaped out the glow
Of many a beacon-flame,
When, twenty thousand years ago,
The Old Stone Age men came.
N.S.W.
Like ships that run before a gale
Millenniums disappear;
The New Stone Age men seek the trail:
Each grips his polished spear.
There dawns a day of doom and dread
Across the heaving flood;
The green of those far isles is red
With Old Stone Age men’s blood.
And since those ancient, murderous raids
Upon the tranquil shore,
Obsidian, bronze and iron blades
Have drunk their fill of gore,
As each succeeding warrior-flood
Burst upon sand and stone
To inundate the groves with blood
Of men unwarlike grown.
That name, Pacific, is a jest;
The ocean’s story, writ
In blood, is found a palimpsest
When men decipher it;
A scroll inscribed with chapters wild
Whose records shall not fade:
Invasion on invasion piled,
And ruthless raid on raid.
Heed now the warning, you who jeer
At war and war’s alarms;
Who buy and sell, and make good cheer,
And bask in beauty’s charms.
Prepare, prepare! Yon sound is plain—
Fate’s footfall, heard once more!
The Future is the Past again,
Met through another door.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Sartor”: A fashion event that won’!
appear in the social columns occurred
on a day on which the winter sun,
for an hour or so, developed sub-
tropic warmth. I was waiting for
a friend on the corner of one of the
streets that debouch on Circular Quay.
The feminine characters in the human
comedy (a very dull one) that paraded
“Don’t girls appeal to you, Bill?”
“By cripes, they don’t! I do all the appealing.”
itself before me were all overcoated and
furred. Then came a short, plump figure
arrayed in a frock which, patterned in
awning stripes, went back, for scanty cut,
to 1929. Over her head she held a bright
green parasol. Three times she went
back and forth across the Quay; each
time she paused and regarded with deep
satisfaction the perspiring damsels who
struggled along in less seasonable attire.
She looked suspiciously like a lady who
presides over a hot-pie counter in that
vicinity, and I’m sure she wasn’t one of
the Younger Set. But she had the guts
of the fashion racket, which is to be in
first.

"Phyl”: “Soso" (B. 2/8/’33) makes a
slip when he suggests that a husband
who is £1374 in arrears with money due
for his wife’s support might be sentenced
to 19 years’ imprisonment. While the
penalty for disobedience is one day for
every four shillings or part of it, it is
provided that no offender shall be de-
tained for longer than 12 months.

“Artifex”: Your true virtuoso is
always interesting, if occasionally boring.
One such who gave evidence in a Sydney
court recently told how he had
been making artificial limbs
for 35 years. He mentioned
that the ordinary wooden leg of
the sort that served Long John
Silver was known in the pro-
fession as “a pauper s leg."
Once upon a time these were
made for 12s. 6d. ; they now
cost £5, while fancy articles of
duralumin and kindred mat-
erials run up into the £5O class.
One disclosure will come as a
shock to most of us. There is
no such thing as a cork leg.
nor has there ever been. The
name is derived from the
city of Cork, once a thriving seat of the
artificial-peg industry.

"Ziphion”: I don't know if Pshaw’s
secretary (B. 9/8/’33) is the same as 20
years since, when, as an autograph-
hunter, I used to bombard the Great
Man with postal applications. The secre-
tarial reply was generally couched in
somewhat bitter invective, along with the
stereotyped “Mr. Shaw’s reply is always
the same, M never forge my own name.’ ”
However, Pshaw unbent at last. When
my book boasted of several royal sig-
natures and a Pope’s he decided to
change his mind, and weighed in with
“Mais que diable vais-je faire d cette
galere?” In those days the secretary was
a woman.

“Belcher”: Readers of “Pickwick” will
recall the elder Weller’s reference to
“moral pocket
‘andkerchers.” I
saw their descen-
dants last week in
a smart Sydney
haberdashery win-
dow. These are of
silk ; on one of
them was printed
a portrait of Hy-
perion, winner of
this year’s Derby,
and about the
border were medal-
lions containing the
names of other
winners of the clas-
sic race. Others de-
pic t e d hunting
scenes of the old-
fashioned sort, the
riders in lurid
“pink” and the
horses in impos-
sible attitudes fly-
in g unbelievable
fences. Such sport-
ing adornments —
other means were
always substituted
for their intended
use —were popular
in the Lancashire
of the late last cen-
tury. They bore
presentments of
famous Soccer
footballers, wrest-
lers and bull-ter-
riers, but I can’t
recall any hunting
or racing scenes.

“Hyr a m ” :
“Hamer’s” pub
that advertised an
“exclusive counter-
iunch” (B. 9/8/’33)
isn’t the only Sydney one that has
found it necessary to gild its attrac-
tions. In George-street, within coo-ee
of the Town Hall, there’s a hostelry
that proclaims to the world “Beautiful
Ladies Lounge Upstairs.”

“Strict Veg.”: A Melbourne medico
with literary interests was torn out of his
bed by the furious clamor of his doorbell.
On the mat he found a playwright and a
pressman. “Don’t ask for explanations,”
yelled the paper man. “Get your things
and come hotfoot!” Five minutes iater
the trio were climbing the stairs of a
frowsy tenement in Footscray. In the
garret the medico was introduced to a
half-naked girl lying on a stretcher. Her
face was green, her teeth were clenched,
her pulse weak and her heart-beats
almost imperceptible. The doctor applied
restorative measures, and meanwhile got
the story. “It’s this way,” said the jour-
nalist. “Euripides here is writing a play
for the centenary, and you know he’s a
realist, or he thinks he is. Well, there’s
“Pa thinks your young man looks weak about the mouth."
“Rot! He ought to try being kissed by him.”
a drug addict in it, and she dies. Well,
he wanted to be quite sure of his detail,
so he picked a girl up in Little Lon
and offered her two quid to act as model,
so to speak. Well, the chemist must have
given him the wrong instructions, be-
cause, after swallowing the dose, she
blew out and stayed like you see her ;
and that’s two hours ago.” At this
moment the girl came to. She sat up,
and her eyes wandered round the room
till they fell on the playwright. “You
gorilla!” she said, and spat viciously in
his face.
* * * *
“White Otter”: Touching authors’
errors and slips of the pen—the more dis-
tinguished the author, the less mercy he
gets —a writer in a Sydney daily rehashes
Kipling’s bloomer of making the Mari-
byrnong Plate a steeplechase in “Plain
Tales from the Hills.” Curiously enough,
he misses the one thing in the 40-years-
pilloried mix-up which Kipling did think
worth correction. Brunt, the jockey, was
described in the story as being “a native
of Perth, a God-forsaken place in West
Australia.” The unkind reflection on
the Swan-side city was excised after the
early editions of the book, although it is
not on record that racing men, whose
teeth were so set on edge by a five-fur-
long dash being confused with a steeple-
chase, ever took any objection to that
description of Perth in the ’eighties.
* * * *
“Sedgemoor”: The Prussian conten-
tion that use of the axe for execution
purposes has “never given rise to objec-
tions” surely needs qualifying, even
from the point of view of the be-
headed (B. 9/8/’33). Take the Duke
of Monmouth. When the executioner,
despite having been handsomely tipped
for his prospective services, “foozled his
approach” (as golfers might phrase it)
in the Duke’s case, history records that
the unhappy nobleman half-raised him-
self from the block for a reproachful
look at the bungler, which only made
matters worse. The guillotine and the
rope may not be perfect lethal instru-
ments, but it may be doubted if either
ever gave scope for a reproachful look
by the victim at the operator after the
grim business was started.
* * * *
“H. 8.”: In mornings such as we have
been experiencing lately, any Sydney man
on the North Shore line or in the West-
ern Suburbs may wake to find his lawn
white with hoar-frost, and yet in his
newspaper the official temperature will be
given as several degrees above freezing
point. The fact is that the city itself
rarely experiences a frost owing to the
protection and warmth afforded by its
buildings, and the Meteorological Office
is in probably the warmest part. Bordered
on three sides by the waters of the harbor
and in a sheltered position in the Rocks
area, the temperature readings recorded
are misleading. More accurate results
would be obtained if the instruments
were set up in some cleared area, as in
French’s Forest, at least two miles from
the waters of ocean or harbor.
* * * *
“Heraut”: The shirt as an emblem of
a cause is much older than Garibaldi
(B. 9/8/’33). In the Middle Ages it was
customary for a knight who wished to
make an unusual demonstration of his
love for a lady—not infrequently some-
one else’s lawful wife —to doff his armor
and, clad in nothing but a shirt, take part
in the melee which always ended off a
knightly tournament. Sometimes he wore
a shift presented for the purpose by his
adored one, and etiquette demanded that
the lady should later don the hacked
and bemired garment. Sometimes, if the
gallant had been killed in the fuss, she
would wear it without changing for
the rest of her life. The modern young
woman, for all the criticism that is heaved
at her, is not like that. If she does
exhibit vast expanses of flesh, it is always
well washed.
* * * *
“Chev.”: There is a man in Melbourne
who visits the Antarctic every morning
—the pilot who ascends from Point Cook
and takes observations that will enable the
official meteorologists to tell the State
what weather to expect. While Melbourne
was complaining of a temperature of
42 degrees Fahrenheit, he was enjoy-
ing one of minus 15.7, which is 47 de-
grees of frost —the coldest since the
flying service Was started a couple of
years ago. If the snow he encounters
in the higher altitudes reached Mel-
bourne it would bury the city to a depth
of 15 inches, but the warmer atmos-
pheres below have turned it into rain
before it arrives in Collins-street.
* ❖ *
“Barsed”: The 144th anniversary of the
Fall of the Bastille was celebrated
in various places last month. It re-
calls the service which the demolition of
that historic clink did for Tommy
Walker, the Westralian ex-Speaker, now
deceased. Tommy was a prolific lec-
turer on all kinds of subjects, but the
Bastille was his trump card. When he
arrived in the West, considerably down
on his luck after having served a couple
of terms in the N.S.W. Assembly, he
hung up his shingle as a teacher of elo-
cution in goldfields towns and did a
trifle of journalism as a sideline. This
routine he would vary with an occa-
sional public lecture, mostly delivered
to help some deserving purpose or to
oblige some mutual-improvement society.
To hear Tommy spreading himself over
the Bastille business with flashing eyes
and a voice torn with generous emotion
was more thrilling than most repertoire
one-acters and vaudeville turns, and
when genuine dramatic entertainment
was scarce people began to look for-
ward to it. It won the declaimer the
publicity he craved, too, and in the end
it helped him to a Labor nomination and
enabled him to climb far higher up the
political ladder than he had ever done
in N. S. Wales. Nor was Tommy un-
grateful, either. Almost to the end of
his life he was always ready to lecture
on the Fall of the Bastille.
THE LATEST NOVELTY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Two male mannequins, both seasoned athletes ami
one with a military record, appeared at a Sydney
fashion show to advertise golf and tennis costumes,
dress- and dinner-suits, and were credited with
doing their job excellently.”
Well, and why not? If sylphs and slender
Graces
May preen and pose as cynosures to stress,
On dainty figures and ’neath winsome faces,
The ravishing appeal of woman’s dress.
Putting, as ’twere, pyjamas through their paces
And making skirts and blouses prepossess,
Why shouldn’t man into his war-paint slip
To boost the finished products of the snip?
You use your neck and arms to make beholders,
Betty, on gauzy wraps and mantles dote;
You wake to llame the bargain-fire that
smoulders
In every heart as o’er the door you float;
Why shouldn’t Bill employ his muscled shoulders
To sell a swallowtail or dinner-coat,
Inspiring sanguine buyers with a dim
Hope that in either they’ll resemble him?
Those well-knit limbs (who knows?) may lend
a glamor
To rigs most outre and to maddest rags.
Such as wherein the portly golfers hammer
And slice their way through obstacles and
snags,
Those pullovers that scream, those socks that
clamor,
And those intolerably shapeless bags
(And can he elegance in those display
1 solemnly affirm he’ll earn his pay).
There’s some may view the innovation glumiy,
But if a personable female can
Proclaim sartorial excellences dumbly,
Say, why the blinking blazes shouldn’t a man?
She’s no monopoly of being comely
Or ever had, since this old world began.
And Eve and Adam had to use the brooks
For aids to ornament and guides to looks.
If women on each other’s curves and hollows
The charms of haberdashery best discern,
From fellow-mentors I submit it follows
That man has twenty times as much to learn.
Forward, Discoboli! Step up, Apollos,
And give the clothes-horse business a turn!
There’s scope for more than girlish graces in
The avocation of the mannequin.

“Hory”: I wrote “Je aime” on the

one young hopeful was too quick for me.
“Please, sir,” he said in a kindly, infor-
mative tone, “the ‘e’ is elided there.” The
form sniggered, for he was an ac-
knowledged baiter of the newcomer.
“Boy,” I said, “do you think 1 have been
teaching French for 28 years and am
not yet fully cognisant of my subject?
Do you?” and I advanced threateningly.
“No, sir,” he said, seemingly a trifle
awed, and I went on to explain the eli-
sion. About a week later there was a
cricket match, and I strolled towards the
scoring board, where a little crowd was
gathered. A small boy came panting up.
“Hey, Pig,” he shouted, “you’ve got
McLeod 28 instead of 29. Change ’em.”
“Boy,” said Pig, leaning down impres-
sively, “do you think I’ve been scoring
at cricket for 28 years and am not yet
cognisant of my subject? Do you?”
There was a red-faced and spluttering
silence around me. Pig turned with a
dazzling smile. “Good match, sir,” he
said in a tone of genial cheer. “Good
match,” I agreed.
“Our visitors don’t look like turning up.”
“Well, what’ll we do, quarrel or read?”
“General Prac.”: I note that the
science of chiropractic has led to one of
its professors being fined in Sydney for
assault. The learned man, it appears,
called at a suburban cottage on some
other business. He saw a nurse in uni-
form, learned that a lady within was
under treatment for a pain in the neck,
and announced that he could cure it.
Then followed (1) a good twisting of the
patient’s neck, (2) loud screams from the
sufferer and (3) police-court proceedings.
The chiropractor’s theory is that all
human ills are caused by the pressure of
misplaced vertebrae on the nerves run-
ning out from the spinal cord ; push or
punch the dislocated bones back into
place, and health is restored. Nobody
has yet stated how the offending bones,
once pushed back, are kept in place. But
this quackery flourishes all over the
U.S.A., where special “colleges” teach it
for a fee, their students including taxi-
drivers, negro railway porters and beauty
specialists. Also, chiropractic has been
found a very lucrative sideline to the
gentler professions of blacksmithing,
piano-moving and pugilism.

“Bumpk.”: A fisherman and a farmer
who set out from Apollo Bay (Vic.) in
a 24ft. launch for a day’s fishing had
an experience they are not likely to for-
get. A rope fouled their propeller, and
they drifted 23 miles towards the Ant
arctic. All shipping had been advised
of their plight, and during 36 hours they
saw craft after craft approach and steam
away. At midnight they saw a vessel's
lights. There was a cupful of petrol in
the tank and a solitary match. They
struck it with frozen fingers and anxious
hearts, and a flare went up. Very soon
they were under the glare of the Nar-
kunda’s searchlight, and half an hour
later they were snugged down in one of
the vessel’s staterooms with their launch
on deck.

-“1700/49th”: I am not at all convinced
that the 4th Division’s complaint’ about
the American troops at Hamel being “too
rough” was meant to refer entirely to
their lack of military training. It was
because the Americans were the rawest
troops (in a military sense) on the West-
ern Front that they were also the most
credulous. Atrocity stories had been
poured into them, and when put into
action they naturally thought they had to
avenge everything, from Nurse Cavell to
the Lusitania. Mopping up dug-outs was
a stern necessity, but to bayonet men who
mostly “kameraded” on sight in partially
wrecked trenches was a different matter.
The Digger (particularly at this stage)
had no real hate for Fritz, but the Ameri-
cans, fine fellows as they were, had come
into the war to earn a reputation for
roughness in more senses than one.
“Jakay”: The Melbourne
Public Lending Library re-
ceives some strange requests. •
The latest came from a
country borrower who asked
for a book containing in-
structions on how to make
catgut. It was not until an
expert on the premises was
approached that the right
book was discovered. The
fact that it was the right
one was placed beyond
doubt when, a week or two
later, the volume was re-
turned tied up with catgut.
“Sixenate”: The limitation of the pur-
poses for which land purchased in the
cutting-up of estates may be used is
hardly “a new kind of snobbery” (B.
2/8/’33); the practice is as old as the
hills. Nearly all the residential town-
ships on the North Shore (Sydney) line
were protected in this way originally :
but if the demand comes the protection
will probably go, as it has gone in Glebe
(a vast portion of which was covered by
such covenants), Enmore and even Potts
and Darling Points. The Courts make
little of lifting embargoes of the dead
hand when just cause is shown. One of
the massive hotels Sydney will have in
the near future is to include in its site
a block which a long-dead Rechabite
owner covenanted was never to be em-
“If a cow has a son, is it a cow-boy?”
ployed for the manufacture or sale of
intoxicating liquors. Thirty years ago
I assisted in the preparation of transfers
of title of lands in Macleay-street on
which, it was stipulated, shops were not
to be erected. Nobody visioned shops
in Macleay-street then ; it is now dotted
with them, one at least being on the land
where they were expressly barred.

“El V.”: The winter memories of an-
cients which fill the papers when Parlia-
ment is not sitting emphasise what re-
markable fellows the bushrangers were.
Last month 1 read of no fewer than
II octogenarians, nonagenarians and cen-
tenarians who knew Thunderbolt, Moon-
light and others of the fraternity ; and
reviewing the reminiscent statistics of the
past three years I have come to the con-
clusion that if all the more famous
marauders held up all the coaches which
they are credited with holding up, the
interior transport of N. S. Wales must
have been completely at a standstill be-
tween 1860 and 1880. Ben Hall, Moon-
light and Morgan, too, must have owned
private ovals or heaths, or whatever a
bushranger uses, on which to stage their
deeds of daring and last stands, judging
from the number of people who claim
to have been present.

“Pat Bushie”: The other day a Texas
(Q.) auctioneer ’phoned to Central Police
Court, Sydney, to ask under what con-
ditions he could conduct a sale over
the border in N.S.W. He was informed
that he must first obtain a license at the
nearest court in the Ma State. Some 20
years ago a Broken Hill auctioneer found
another way out of the difficulty. He
was arranging to put up some houses, a
blacksmith’s shop and a quantity of tools
at Cockburn, just over the border in S.
Aus., when he found that he could not
legally sell in the neighboring State.
Accordingly, on sale day, he took the
prospective buyers on a tour of inspec-
tion, numbered each building, had the
tools lined up just inside the border fence
on the S. Aus. side, climbed through the
fence into N.S.W. with his customers and
knocked down everything, the buildings
by numbers, the tools by indicating them.
Two Cockburn constables looked on from
their own territory, powerless to interfere.

“Kerys”: There are still parents
who are unmoved by the attention of
the press when their youngsters get into
the limelight. The youngest Mac-
Taggart fell over a 90ft. cliff near Dun-
edin (M.L.) and was rescued with ropes
from the ledge where he had miracu-
lously arrived unhurt. A couple of re-
porters arrived at the MacTaggart resi-
dence to get first-hand impressions. “And
what did you do, sir,” inquired one,
“when you had your son safe once
more?” “Weel,” said the grateful father,
“Ah takit the laddie hame and Ah takit
him to his mither” “And then?”
asked the reporter, breathlessly preparing
to note the MacTaggart emotions. “Weel,
then, Ah takit doon the strap frae over
the door and Ah gied him sic a skelping
he’ll no soon fergit it.” The paper recorded
next day that MacTaggart’s attitude to
his son’s escapade was one of “true Scot-
tish calm.”
“Inaudi”: “X.S.” (B. 9/8/33), who pre-
sents as a miracle of memory a blind
man’s delivery of an address of 10,000
words composed by himself, compares
the feat with that of a detective who gave
a 10,500-word account of facts observed
by him, including “conversations.” There’s
really no comparison. A detective, like
a newspaper reporter, concentrates on
essential facts ; a reciter devotes himself
to a repetition of words—or notes. Back-
haus can play from memory all Bee-
thoven’s sonatas ; all the great works of
Chopin, Brahms and Bach, and almost
any Schumann or Schubert number he
may be called upon to play. And perhaps
there are pianists who can beat Backhaus’s
record for note-memory which runs
well up into the millions. Even little
Philip Hargraves has about four millions
to his credit. Alexander Watson, the
elocutionist, has a repertoire equivalent
to four Bibles. As to memories of
essential facts —the reporter’s memory
as contrasted with the reciter’s memory
—there isn’t one of the trained pro-
fessions that doesn’t involve on its prac-
titioners the carrying of a memory-load
comparable to Backhaus’s or Watson’s.
* * *
“Lao-dah”: Whatever the rulings of
the various authorities, Melbourne’s cen-
tenary will be a “cen-TEN-ary.” That is how
nine citizens out of ten pronounce it, in
my experience. Moreover, their choice
is endorsed by no less a person than
Brigadier-General Jess, boss of the en-
tire proceedings.
❖ i|: sj:
“Grosvenor”: One George J. Hall, of
Marlborough—an Englishman who has
spent 11 years in Australia—concluded
a letter to the “New Statesman and
Nation” (1/7/33):
So long as Englishmen take to Australia that
public-school manner which has rightly earned
reprobation in other countries the present hos-
tility will remain.
Englishmen who were never at a public
school often have it. Two of the most
industrious exploiters I ever knew were
a P. and O. officer who was uncertain
of his aspirates and a Regent-street shop-
assistant. It was often remarked when
the Prince was here that neither he nor
his cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, had
a trace of it, whereas several of the Re-
nown officers were sad cases. This ille-
gitimate brother of Dignity is a heavy
liability these democratic days. The
objection is that the user is suspected of
trying to “come it” over strangers. The
suspicion is often justified, but in some
cases what looks like superciliousness is
merely self-consciousness. The proof is
that many a travelling Briton begins an
acquaintanceship with an exaggeratedly
affected manner, and becomes completely
natural when friendship supervenes. It
is safe to say, by the way, that you never
find this manner in one who is both
well-bred and sure of himself.
BALLADE OF A BURDENSOME NAME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A rose by any other name would smell
As sweet” —so Shakspeare voiced a truth
profound.
Still, there are weeds, it’s undeniable,
Might have a slightly less displeasing sound;
Some title new, round Stinking Roger wound,
For instance, would alleviate the jar.
So, on this quite intelligible ground,
They’d have Long Bay rechristened Malabar.
It isn’t those within the citadel
Who such suggestion for a change propound;
Their troubles what it’s called, who’re doing a
spell
For deeds whereon the puissant Law has
frowned.
But those who dwell about it and around
Find in the name a blemish and a scar;
They fain would see the sticky stigma downed.
They want Long Bay relabelled Malabar.
What’s in a name? Nathless you’ll hear
folks tell
“Wolf” as a prefix helps to damn a hound.
While “shepherd dog” ’s a shield reliable
Malevolent detractors to confound.
111-omened Tyburn, Newgate ill-renowned,
You’d find as permanent addresses far
From happy —also Pentridge, I’ll be bound....
They’d have Long Bay rechristened Malabar.
Prince, never reckon it a bagatelle.
Life’s little pin-pricks peace of mind may mar.
A simple pen-stroke will their woes dispel
Who want Long Bay relabelled Malabar.

POLITICAL POINTS
Extension of the life of the South Aus.
Parliament is not going to be as easy as
Butler bargained for. Bagot, secretary
of the Citizens’ League, objects to it —
so vigorously that the Premier was pro-
voked into saying that Bagot’s views did
not matter. They mattered a lot to
Butler at the general election, but some
politicians have short memories as well
as thin skins.
Recent developments in long-distance
aviation haven’t been lost on Nippon.
An aerial attack on Tokio was part of
the annual manoeuvres. Tokio is 4768
miles from ‘Frisco, the nearest point
whence air attacks might be expected,
if Vladivostok is excluded.
Vic. Labor Assemblymen Barry and
Holland have pegged out the old Carlton
Cricket Ground as a mining lease to
prevent the legalised theft of one more
playground. It is proposed to pinch the
land for a hostel for women uni-
versity students, although the University
has 110 acres of its own. Melbourne,
like other big cities, should be adding
to its playgrounds rather than taking
away from them. They are the best safe-
guards against Bolshevism which can be
devised.
There is one thing about Lyons—no-
body could accuse him of not being a
whole-hearted Protectionist. But he has
none of the skill which Bruce showed in
dealing with the Country party and with
deputations. In Sydney the other day
he was asked by representatives of the
Joint Committee for Tariff Revision to
withhold further action on present cus-
toms schedules and to reintroduce and
consider the further easing of the 1921-
30 tariff. He cried “It is the most in-
decent request made to me since I have
been Prime Minister ; I regard it as an
insult.” Bruce might have felt like that,
but he would have said something which
committed him to nothing and offended
nobody.
The Sydney people who saw the Pri-
minister about tariff reduction were all
supporters of his party at the general
election. Mindful of this, Minister White
spoke in a milder strain than his chief,
making a point of the fact that “more
than half the tariff is revenue-producing.”
That’s just the trouble. The tariff is
largely a tariff for revenue, and Protec-
tion gets all the blame.
The measure proposed by Martin, the
N.S.W. Minister of Justice, for the pro-
tection of the public against defaulting
solicitors follows the lines of one that
has been on the Maoriland Statute Book
for four years. Each M.L. solicitor pays
a special annual sub. of between £5 and
£lO to the Law Society, which can levy
on him for an extra £lO a year if there
isn’t enough in the fund to repay clients
whose money has been stolen. It has
power to investigate solicitors’ accounts.
There have been no large drains on the
funds since its inception.
Littleton Groom is rejoining the Nats.,
now called the U.A.P., and the history of
the Nat. dissensions of 1929, which
handed Australia over to the Scullidores,
closes. Maxwell and Hughes came back
meekly to sit behind Latham in 1931.
Wally Marks and Mann have lost their
seats. Groom lost his in 1929, when
Arthur Morgan, a member of a Darling
Downs political family as old as his own,
beat him. But Parliament did not look
like Parliament without Groom, so last
time the Downs reverted to the rebel
(the mildest that ever helped to scuttle
a political ship) who had been their
member since 1901.
No burst of cheering greeted the pro-
posal to increase the Sydney City Coun-
cil membership by one alderman from
each ward so that more committee mem-
bers might be available. At present the
officers do the work; the committees,
nicely-balanced coteries of Lib. and Lab.,
do the wrangling. When there were no
committees, the show being run by a
commission, there were less cackle and
better balance-sheets.
Opposition-leader .Keenan pointed out
that when Westralian Labor came in
it announced that the unemployment
question was so pressing that one Min-
ister, Kenneally, must give his whole time
to it, whereupon it let Kenneally go to
Sydney for three weeks to preside at the
Labor “unity” conference. Stumped for
a reply, Collier took refuge in the asser-
tion that one of Mitchell’s Ministers, un-
named, had gone to Adelaide to see a
Test match, and billed the State for his
expenses ; Keenan, he added, had made
no row about that. “How could I,” the
other aptly asked, “seeing that this is the
first I’ve heard of it?” Keenan left the
Ministry before the Test-match period.
“Second dinner bugle, gents.”
“What about it, Dave? Another feed won't hurt us.”
If the Murray Bridge branch of the
party organisation has its way, South
Aus. Labor, when it regains office, “will
appoint a commission vested with plen-
ary and punitive powers to examine the
banking accounts of all members who
have broken away from the movement
since 1914.” But that alone won’t satisfy
Murray Bridge: “An inventory shall be
taken of all property of candidates be-
fore they enter Parliament” ; “a commis-
sion shall inquire into their financial posi-
tion every year,” and “any property for
which they cannot satisfactorily account
shall be confiscated.” It is not expected
by tin-hare and fruit-machine experts
that these proposals will be copied in
N. S. Wales.
How it wakes these politicians and
public bodies up when somebody asks
for something and looks like getting it!
As soon as the Riverina began to talk
of separation, gatherings of Sydney in-
terests asked the Government to make
transport from Sydney to the south as
cheap as transport from Melbourne.
Stevens himself set off for the field of
battle in a 44-ton rail car (said to cost
a couple of shillings a mile to run) to
open a reservoir and deliver a policy
speech and generally to prove to the
Riverina people how much Macquarie-
street loves them —and their 14 U.A.P.
and U.C.P. seats.
Angus, of Gunbower, made a fuss in
Vic. Assembly because the rate-reduc-
tion demands of irrigators and other
customers of the Water Commission have
gone unheeded. Argyle protested that
the State had really been over-generous.
Of annual interest, plus exchange, total-
ling £1,201,331, the Water Commission
contributes £368,756, 1.475 per cent. ;
the general taxpayers are levied upon to
provide the balance, 3.325 per cent. Still,
the Argyle Government, like the others,
is holding out its hands for loan money
to provide more of these “reproductive
works.”
As a result of its experience with the
person who professed to have a cancer
cure in his pocket, Queensland Labor is
considering an Act to deal with quackery.
But the thing, it seems, “is designed
rather against those who make preten-
tious claims to cure than against herbal-
ists.” If an individual with a stuffed
lizard and a few bunches of dried vege-
tation in his dirty window is not one
“making pretentious claims to cure,”
what on earth is he?
Some of Stevens’s supporters are poor
attenders of divisions. There may be
excuses for Weaver, who turned up only
9 times out of 33 during last session,
and for Stevens himself (12) and Brux-
ner (6), his deputy ; but what justifica-
tion can Lloyd, of Mosman, give for his
11 appearances, or F. W. Foster for his
12? There is no slackness of the sort
on the Labor side. The bulk of Lang’s
members have full tallies ; but only four
newcomers and two old hands —one was
Alphabetical Reid from Manly —got full
marks among the U.A.P. and C.P. mem-
bers. Everybody rolled up for his gold
pass and salary on the due dates.
To assist electoral officers in wrestling
with the intricacies of the Leg. Council
ballot, mock elections have been held
at Sydney Parliament House. They do
not help much, because many of the can-
didates are concealing their intentions as
darkly as if they intended to blow
up the Government. In the moribund
House there are 58 Ministerialists, 44
Langsters, 12 Federal A.L.P. men and
four Independents; but there will be
many non-starters. On paper 36 Minis-
terialists and 24 Oppositionists should
survive ; but anything may happen.
Victorians on relief works in the
country are to be allowed tp earn
2s. 6d. to 6s. per day more than at
present. Where they are employed
on railway work and cannot return to
their homes each night, they are to
have a 44-hour week instead of a
40-hour week, with the result that they
will now be able to earn a maximum of
£2 19s. a week, instead of £2 13s. Men
who return to their homes will get an
increase from £2 ss. 4d. to £2 Bs. It is
a sorry business though. The gods must
think a nation mad which taxes men out
of work and then uses the taxes to put
them in again.
Affairs in the Free State are getting
no better fast. De Valera has been
howled down in the Dail by deputies
whose farmer-constituents are facing ruin
because of the tragic trade war with
Britain. An organisation called the Blue
Shirts has shot up, headed by a General
O’Duffy, who claims to have 40,000 fol-
lowers, and, “including associate mem-
bers, 200,000” —presumably 40,000 gentle-
men in blue shirts and 160,000 ladies in
blue skirts —and proposes to “lead them
to victory for an independent Ireland,
free from sea to sea.” Mr. O’Duffy in-
vited friends and admirers to a parade in
uniform at Dublin on Sunday. The Re-
publican Government “proclaimed” it in
the old Castle fashion, and has set up a
tribunal of army officers, under Cos-
grave’s Public Safety Act, to “try offen-
ders.” Australians can sympathise with
the people of the Free State. They know
what it is to suffer from an excess of
politics.
“Mameluke”: That reference to the
Queensland civil service “janizaries” (B.
9/8/’33) reminds me that discussion of the
union’s annual report produced further
evidence of the sense of its own power
felt by the organisation. One motion ex-
pressed “the hope” that the Government
would see its way to pay salary increases
at once. Mr. Herlihy objected. Amend-
ment that the word “request” be substi-
tuted for “hope.” Carried ; and the meet-
ing adjourned, astonished at its own
moderation in not insisting on “demand.”
“E.A.8.”: McPhee’s retention of his
Premiership right through the depres-
sion (B. 26/7/’33) is due to no particu-
lar merit on Mac’s part. He owes his
tenure of office to Opposition-leader
Ogilvie. Tasmania won’t have Ogilvie
at any price. The biggest men in the
Speck (the biggest of all was Henry
Jones) don’t enter Parliament but call
the tune to which Governments dance.
McPhee is content with this arrange-
ment, and will be safe as long as he goes
on dancing.

Bulletin writer G. M. Turnbull, of
Papua, has had his second Bulletin
serial, “Paradise Plumes,” accepted for
book publication. Stanley Paul, of Lon-
don, will put it between boards, and it
will be on the stalls within a few months.
This follows “Alien Corn,” published by
the same house last October under the
title “Disenchantment.”
The passing of W. C. Cormack, senior
partner in Troup, Harwood and Co.,
chartered accountants in Sydney, Mel-
bourne and Brisbane, who died sud-
denly of heart attack on August 11,
will shock a host of friends all round
Australia. A bachelor, the little man
made the whole world his family, and his
kind deeds were only limited by his leis-
ure and the depth of his pocket. He was
a vice-president of the Sydney Employers’
Federation, and had all his mature life
been an ardent golfer. At one time he
was treasurer of Brisbane’s single ex-
clusive club at Yeerongpilly, but latterly
played with the Australian Club in
Sydney.
Westralia has lost its oldest ex-Premier,
whose term of office (a bare five weeks)
dated back to 1901, by the death of A. E.
Morgans in Perth at a ripe 83. Morgans
was a Welshman and a shrewd one;
after some mining experiences in Central
America, he turned up at Coolgardie. He
was already accounted a wealthy man
when the “Old Camp” sent him to the
Assembly in 1897 —one of his opponents
was “Smiler” Hales. In the whirligig of
post-Federation and post-Forrest politics
Morgans found himself commissioned to
form a Ministry when George Leake had
A. E. MORGANS, an old-time W.A.
Premier, just passed over, as Low
saw him in 1914.
met with a temporary reverse. He never
met Parliament, though. When his Cabi-
net submitted itself for re-election, the
Opposition and the then infant Labor
party combined to euchre it; two brand-
new Ministers were rejected and Morgans
threw up the sponge. He retired from
Parliament in 1904 and took no further
part in public life.
Norman Bourke, the new president of
the United Graziers of Queensland, bulks
big in the State’s pastoral industry, in
which he has been engaged all his life,
his experience ranging into all parts of
Queensland. He is managing director of
Kamilaroi Pastoral Co. and a director of
the Sesbania P.C., while he is also on
the board of Moreheads, Ltd. For some
time past he has been chairman of the
cattle committee of the U.G.Q.
J. T. Scrymgeour, who won both male
and female beef Shorthorn champion-
ships at the Brisbane Show, is a fine ex-
ample of “Australia for pluck.” He had
just begun his show-ring career when war
broke out. He went; he returned

blinded. Nothing daunted, he continued
his study of the Shorthorn, by hand.
To-day there is scarcely a better judge of
a beast in Australia —or a more cheerful
personality, for that matter.
Australia has lost one of its leading
ornithologists in David Gaukrodger, just
dead in Brisbane. Youthful managerships
on Terrick Terrick and Saltern Creek,
15 years at Alice Downs and then a
domain of his own at Lancevale and
Westhill gave him ample opportunity to
study feathers. He was a skilled photo-
grapher, and his writings and pictures
added a good deal to natural-history
knowledge of Central Queensland.
J. S. Vagg, a native product of the
Riverina and shed-manager for the Grif-
fith Producers’ Co-op. Co., which is said
to have the most modern citrus-packing
plant outside America, goes to England
to represent the Commonwealth and Aus-
tralian citrus-growers. He has already
studied the American fruit situation on
the spot, and his report on British market-
ing will probably tell us why Jerusalem
can sell oranges to Glasgae and we can’t.
A. J. S. Harris, Melbourne field sec-
retary of the Salvation Army, is about
to retire after 46 years behind the tam-
bourine. He is one of the best known
S. Army men in the Commonwealth and
has held down big jobs in nearly every
capital city. His friendly exterior cloaks
a strong personality. He holds the rank
of colonel, has been a divisional com-
mander and had a fine record in training
men at the Victoria-parade centre before
he was appointed to his present position.
Joseph Verco, dead in Adelaide at
82, was a South Aus. product, with
a London medical training, 1870 to
1878. From then till 1919, when he re-
tired, he was Adelaide’s great physician.
His list of honors, titles and medals was
big, and he worked untiringly for hos-
pitals and the university; also for his
church and for the Royal Society, being
an authority on shells in particular.
Mention of Sir Thomas Dunhill, hon.
surgeon to the King, draws attention to
the number -of Australian doctors who
have established themselves in London.
The following may be mentioned:
Norman Haire (Ha rley-street specialist
and author of the sensational “Hymen”);
Arthur Lynch (all-round professional
man and veteran of two wars); James
Kemble (of Harley-street, author of the
recent book “Idols and Invalids”) ; Cyril
P. Bryan (author of “The Papyrus
Ebers” and “Round About Harley
Street”); H. W. B. Cairns (the noted
brain specialist, credited with a “surgical
miracle” recently); Lieut.-Col. Ernest
Herga, formerly a well-known London
University footballer; Victor Stone
(senior surgeon of St. Nicholas Hospital,
London); Dennis Browne (noted child-
ren’s specialist, husband of Australian
novelist Helen Simpson, and relative of
Rolf Boldrewood); Len Bown (Austra-
lian Rhodes scholar and English inter-
national Rugby player); and Mack, J. E.
Wrigley, Kevin O’Day, D. I. Fitzpatrick
and M. H. B. Robinson. Most of these
medicoes, all of them very successful,
are Victorians or Queenslanders. Bryan
is a Westralian who qualified as a Digger
student.
Albert English, who celebrated his
70th birthday in Papua recently, must
be one of the last of the old brigade
there. English-born, he came young to
Australia in 1881, and after a couple of
years’ collecting in this country for the
Australian Museum, went to what was
then literally a No-man’s Land. Later
he was present at the annexation
by Britain, and under Sir William (then
Dr.) MacGregor was appointed the first
Government Agent, as he was the last.
For many years English lived at Rigo,
near Moresby, where he founded one of
the first plantations in British New
Guinea. A noted naturalist and collec-
tor, he did much early exploratory work
with MacGregor, while world-famous an-
thropologists like Haddon and Seligman
drew much from his store of knowledge
of Papuan peoples and fauna. He is
writing a book of his adventures.
N. S. Wales Government Statistician
Thomas Waites is a man very much in
the public eye at present. His exhaustive
report on the Douglas Social Credit
scheme is this year’s best-seller among
Government Printing Office publications,
but he is not the sort of man to give
himself airs about it. Yorkshire-born,
Waites came to Australia when two
years old (he is 49 now) in the
Aberdeen White Star iron clipper
Samuel Plimsoll, which, incidentally,
is now a coal hulk at Fremantle.
T. WAITES, N.S.W. Statistician, who is
no believer in the Douglas plan.
Grounded at Darling-road (Balmain) pub-
lic school, he later entered Sydney High
School on a scholarship. He was among
the earliest to obtain the Sydney Univer-
sity’s Diploma in Economics. In 1890
he joined the Education Department, and
seven years later was transferred to the
Bureau of Statistics. There he learned
his job under T. A. Coghlan. The war
took him abroad from April, 1916, to
Nov., 1917 ; he served in the 13th Engi-
neers, and was wounded at Flers.
Frank Nelson Young, who has seen
the Commonwealth Wool and Produce
Co., the pioneer co-operative wool-sell-
ing company, grow from small beginnings
to its present important position since
he became its general manager, just
prior to the war, comes of a well-known
Adelaide family, his brother being knight
Walter Young, who got Premier Hill into
trouble at the Trades Hall for giving
him a title. F.N. is an outstanding per-
FRANK YOUNG, the South Australian-
horn head of the Commonwealth
Wool and Produce Co.
sonality in the Australian wool trade.
He was vice-president of the State Wool
Committee during the war-time days of
the Imperial purchase scheme. He lives
at Campbelltown, where he breeds high-
class stock, including Clydesdales, and
has a small stud of Southdown sheep.
The farm now provides most of his
amusement and exercise. In his younger
days he was a prominent footballer and
rower in Adelaide.
The sudden eruption into the limelight
of Samuel Mauger, who is 76, must
make a lot of Victorians think they are
seeing ghosts. The founder of the Anti-
Sweating League, the father of wages
boards and the Vic. Fire Brigades Act,
of early closing and the Saturday half-
holiday, he is one of the last men alive
who was associated with David Syme
in the initiation of the Australian Pro-
tection movement. The first meeting of
the Protection Association was held in
his office at 66 Bourke-street, with Syme,
Deakin, Beazley, Ben Hoare and other
stalwarts present. He and W F. Schey,
of N.S.W., were named hon. secretaries.
“I have learned with astonishment,” wrote
Edward Braddon, one of his most vigor-
ous opponents, “that Mr.' Mauger has no
financial interest whatever in a single
Australian manufacturing industry and
that his work... .is purely in the interests
of his native land.” Mauger sat in the
Vic. Leg. Assembly for a time and for
Melbourne Ports and Maribyrnong in the
Reps, for several years. He was P.M.G.
in the second Deakin Admistration.
“X”: Marconi, among other records,
holds one of pleasant memory connected
with Australia. A few minutes before
he was to attempt a broadcast to the
Sydney Town Hall in 1930 we were
holding a conversation, he from his yacht
in Genoa Harbor, I from the Sydney
Town Hall platform. I asked him to re-
main at the instrument rill the signal
came through for him to speak. “That’s
a long time,” he said. “What shall I do
with it—whistle?” “Yes, whistle. There
are six Australian girls hanging on to
a panel here, so you’ve got an audience.”
There was a mischievous chuckle at the
other end, 11,000 miles away, and a
moment later six thrilled young Austra-
lians were listening to “La Donna e
Mobile” coming over the ether in full
blast. It was the first whistling concert
transmitted across the world.

*Prefs. have had 4 p.c. ( £84,694) each year.
Though it has branches in every State
and Maoriland, the C.B.A.’s most exten-
sive connections are in Victoria, and Vic.
has not been so depressed lately as some
of her sister States. The bank last year
worked its fixed deposits down by
£278,000, gathered an extra £924,000 on
current account, and with its own interest
bill thus lightened became more disposed
to lend money. Advances mounted
£BBB,OOO, but the margin of interest is
not so big as it was a couple of years
ago, and the 4 p.c. pref. capital is little
help these days.
Bank clearances haven’t picked up to
any great extent yet, though the London
exchange, generally speaking, was a trifle
more profitable last year owing to heavier
imports. After making an unspecified
transfer to contingency reserve (out of
which provision has been made for bad
and doubtful debts), and providing for
fluctuations in investments and taxation,
gross earnings showed a drop of £12,715
last term:

•Less taxes and provision for contingencies.
Thus the recovery of £13,964 in net
profit was all due to a cut of £26,679
in administration exes. After allowing
for pref. div. requirements (£84,694)
enough was left to show 6.4 p.c. on ord.
capital, compared with 5.7 p.c. in the
preceding year. Rather than increase the
div. a point the board struck £20,000
(up £10,000) off premises, and £8940 was
carried to reserves, now £79,252 in excess
of ord. capital.
Since 1920 shareholders have sub-
scribed £3,808,682, one half capital and
the other half premiums. Ord. div.,
therefore, is worth only half the declared
rate on most of the capital, and earning-
power is not all it looks either. In addi-
tion to the share premiums and undis-
tributed earnings shown in the introduc-
tory table, profit-making is assisted by
£250,000 in exchange adjustment re-
serve ; this provision was made in 1932
to guard against possible fluctuations in
the London rate.
The banking position is strong:

Helped by its Government contract,
which has been extended to October,
1934, and bigger orders from outside
sources, this N.S.W. cement co. has had
a good year. After provision of the usual
£25,000 for depreciation, net profits re-
covered £20,553 to £42,810 nearly
double the previous year’s. The show-
ing was equal to 8.5 p.c. on capital, com-
pared with 4.4, 7.9, 9.5 and 9.4 p.c. back
to 1929 ; so an extra 2 p.c. was handed
to shareholders, making 6 p.c. for the
term, and £12,855 was carried to reserves
(£68,851). J „
Seven years ago the co. started ott
with a Government contract and a
100,000-ton-p.a. , plant near Kandos
(N.S.W.). With one large customer
assured the co. has thus been able to go
on earning profits and paying divs. in
spite of the collapse in demand and the
heavily overcapitalised position of the
industry generally. Last term, notwith-
standing that Government orders for
cement materially increased, they did not
absorb the 65,000 tons p.a. required by
the co.’s contract, which was to expire in
September next. Hence the twelve-
months’ extension. The possibility of loss
of Government custom and the conse-
quent effect on profits are factors which
kept the scrip low on the market —it was
down around 7s. at one stage. Investors
have shown more confidence lately, the
£1 ords. being priced at 16s. 9d. last week-
end, at which figure the return is 7.2
p.c. on the past year’s div. basis. The
backing is 235. 7d. in net tangibles,
largely plant, worth what it can earn.
Finances have shown encouraging im-
provement :

Net profit, written after visibly sending
£8854 to depreciation reserve (£57,311),
was £4595 better at £6818.. The result
was achieved in spite of no improvement
in conditions, the board says ; but fin-
ances are comfortable nowadays, and
trade has picked up since the accounts
closed, so all but £Bl5 of the claimed
earnings was handed out in a 3 1-3 p.c.
div. Shareholders had gone hungry in
the two preceding years.
The co. began manufacturing Peters’
ice cream in Brisbane in Nov., 1928 ;
£20,000 was paid for the Queensland
trade-marks of Peters, and £BOOO for the
goodwill of the Arctic Co. The co. later
sold its N.Q. rights to another subsidiary
for £5OOO in shares; this amount was
struck off the Brisbane co.’s intangibles,
reducing them to £23,000.
Last year’s profit was equal to 3.8 p.c.
on capital, compared with 1.2, 3.3, 10.6
and 14.8 p.c. in the four preceding years.
Considering the semi-luxury nature of
the product, last year’s showing, written
after allowing what appears to be ample
depreciation, is encouraging. Finances
are improving, too:

A further £14,335 was worked off the

little movement, plant has been “kept

repair.” Investments represent £12,576
shares in subsidiary cos., £16,034 loans
to ditto, and £6393 outside investments.
Though the Townsville co. is paying a
3 p.c. div. in respect of its last year,
aggregate result of the pups was a loss.
There are 82,586 fully-paid £1 shares
and 130,000 paid to 15s. The contribs.
are at 135., thus returning 3.8 p.c. The
Sydney parent co.’s holding represents

Less super, was used in S.A. last term,
and the co.’s turnover dropped slightly.
Disclosed net profits, however, were only
£72 lower, and the 4 p.c. div. was again
paid, with £582 to spare. Gross earn-
ings (£30,793) were actually £3OBO higher,
but exes. (£16,735) absorbed all the in-
crease and £72 besides. The profit was
written after taking fixed assets into
account at £13,914 less than at the pre-
vious balance, and after valuing stock at
£6974 lower.
Wheat prices being barely remunera-
tive, farmers have been forced to econo-
mise in the use of artificial manures.
Recently prices have been showing more
life ; “but it would be foolish to hazard
an opinion as to the outcome of the
negotiations between the four chief pro-
ducing countries,” the board says. How-
ever, there is certainly more hope in this
year’s outlook.
Finances have shown consistent im-
provement in late years:

The Wallaroo and Birkenhead freeholds
and plant, and all other fixed assets,
figure at £233,120, £32,549 less than the
book value of three years ago. The cash
holding is equal to more than ss. a share.
More or less liquid surplus (£213,622)
strengthened £16,495 last term.
Much depends upon the prices of agri-
cultural and pastoral products, and on
how far it will pay farmers to stimulate
yields with fertilisers. A great deal will
also depend upon the efficiency and earn-
ing power of the co.’s plant. The Diesel-
driven generating equipment installed in
1928 has helped to keep operating costs
down, and depreciation does not appear
to have been neglected.
The shares, backed by 255. sd. in net
tangibles (book value), can be picked
up at 20s. 6d. They show 3.9 p.c. on
last year’s div. basis.

Pref. shareholders have had no cause
to regret the association with the “Craven
A” interests, which acquired 75,098 un-
issued Is. ords. in 1930, paying 10s. a
share, the premium going to reserves.
Originally Sniders and Abrahams, the co.
reconstructed under the name of G.
G. Goode in 1923, and there was a
further clean-up three years later; it
meant that, altogether, 9s. per 10s. ord.
share had vanished. The prefs., whose
div. rate was lifted from 8 p.c. to
10 p.c. meanwhile, received their div.
with little to spare during the four years
to the linking-up with Carreras, Ltd.,
of London, when the present title was
adopted by the Australian co.
Since manufacture under the British
trade-marks commenced there has been
a big jump in output, and gross profits
(£98,889, up £19,316 last term) have more
than doubled. Establishment and other
exes, have absorbed most of the increase ;
but last term there was a distinct strength-
ening in the net figure (£11,273), which
was £2981 higher. Allowing for the
prefs., it was equal to 54.7 p.c. on the
£lO,OOO of ord. capital, and a 25 p.c. div.
was paid. It called for only £2500, how-
ever, and £2973 was carried to reserves,
now £40,215 in excess of goodwill
(£6204).
When the English interests came in the
co. bought itself a home:

That, modernisation of plant and the
building-up of stocks have been mainly
responsible for the growth in the debt
(£147,856, up £39,926). Last term the
co. acquired all the shares in Morris and
Johnston, Ltd., distributors of its pro-
ducts in N.S.W., in exchange for 20,000
10 p.c. prefs. Stocks were £41,030
heavier at the close of accounts, and
debtors mounted £13,582. More or less
liquids then exceeded the debt by
£33,299 ; in addition, there is the backing
of the English co.
Last sales of the prefs. were at 335.
6d. ; that price shows 6 p.c. Net tan-
gible backing amounts to £1 14s. lOd.
per pref. share on book values.

There has been a spasm of activity in
this co.’s ord. shares on ’Change, mainly
on the strength of a rumored new agency
to be acquired. The “Wild Cat” is un-
able to substantiate. But with its pre-
sent well-known lines and Common-
wealth-wide engineering connections the
co. has had a better year ; the disclosed
loss (£10,424, down £5693) was written
after taking stock at £12,898 lower, and
reducing the book value of plant by
£6325. Shareholders, both pref. and ord.,
missed again, and the deficit mounted to
£20,192. Also, the prefs. have a claim
for £3752 div. arrears.
The co.’s trade, never the easiest, has
been severely hit by the slump in con-
struction activity. J3ut if Broken Hill
Prop.’s figures are any guide, turnover
should now be improving. Debtors
(£66,205, up £4176) suggest that it is:
1927 1930. 1932. 1933.

Much depends upon the basis on which
debtors and stocks have been taken into
account. In addition to putting the axe
into exes., one of the board’s big prob-
lems has been to work down the debt.
It has been successful, too ; after a cut
of £105,999 during the two years to 1932,
another £2917 was worked off last term.

The reduction has been made possible by
the liquidation of stocks and book debts ,
part of the losses over the past three
years is probably due to the same cause.
A great deal rests upon how soon
the asset wastage of the past three years
can be stopped. Last term the more or
less liquid surplus (£68,679) slipped only
£4lOO, as against £12,640 in the previous
term. The exchange is giving a little help
on the manufacturing side, but it ad-
versely affects imported lines, and labor
conditions have always been a handicap.
Covered by net tangibles with a book
value of 14s. 2d., mostly freeholds, the
16s. ords. are priced at 4s. on the market.
Francis Birtles’s N.T. show, Arnhem
Land Gold Development (N.L.), which
Jack Bailey helped to finance, has re-
ceived its first assays from the Darwin
Mines Department. No. 1 shaft goes
lOoz. 7dwt., No. 2 soz. 3dwt., and No. 3
3oz. ldwt. A two-ton bulk sample is
being shipped to Port Kembla by the
Marella, Jack Bailey accompanying.
First reports on the mine announced
“good free gold in hard, grey schist,” the
reef varying from 7ft. wide in No. 1
shaft to 4ft. 6in. in No. 2. It is difficult
to get a reliable assay of “free” gold ;
the bulk sample should give a more
representative idea of values.

Sulphide Gold (Junction Reefs), Ltd.,
which has a show about seven miles from
Mandurama (N.S.W.), was formed in
June, 1932, and took up properties
totalling 50 acres. The mine is a de-
veloped one, formerly owned by the
Lyndhurst Railway Co. Two shifts are
now being worked in tunnelling on the
four main reefs ; average values go about
10 or 11 ’weights, and the plant is mak-
ing over 90 p.c. extraction. Paid capital
is £25,000.

On the Golden Gate (Nundle, N.S.W.),
No. 1 shaft has been sunk 13ft. to a total
depth of 46ft. The lode here is 6ft. wide.
At 39ft. a sample gave 2oz. 16dwt. ; ore
mined from this section during the latest
fortnight’s working is estimated by the
manager to go 25 ’weights. Altogether
there is 159 tons ore of varying value
at grass.

Bulolo Gold Dredging’s gross produc-
tion for July was 82300 z. fine from

is put at £48,877, taking gold in at £7

Subject to sanction by shareholders,
Wiluna Gold Corporation proposes to
offer 250,000 new £1 shares to those on
the register at September 4, in the propor-
tion of one for five, at a price of £2 a
share. Convertible-note holders will also
be asked to turn their holdings into scrip.
Liability under notes now figures at
£290,150, and the board intends to pay
off those noteholders who fail to convert
—which should mean a rush to turn notes
into shares. Out of the proceeds of the
share issue it is proposed to discharge
the £225,000 Government-guaranteed debt
of Wiluna Gold Mines, the Australian
operating co. Interest saving on discharge
of the two lots of debt is put at £50,000
p.a. Development of the northern portion
of Wiluna will be carried on. The plant
now having a capacity of 40,000 tons a
month, expenditure under that head is
practically finished, and future profits of
the working co. will be earmarked for
distribution to the parent, the board says.
Hi * * *
Chairman Algy Moreing had a cheer-
ful tale to tell at the Sons of Gwalia
meeting. He claimed that the mine was
rapidly recovering from the arrears of
development which had seriously affected
it in the past few years. Results in the
bottom indicated that the main shoot
would live and remain payable down to
a very much greater depth. Mining in
deeper ground might cause a rise in
costs, but it was anticipated that any
rise would be offset by improvement in
grade, indicated by ore exposures in the
present bottom levels. Intentions are
to place the property in a position to earn
good profits even if the price of gold
comes back to 85s.
* Hi * *
Diamond-drilling has resuscitated the
Sons of Gwalia and the Boulder Belt
mines, and the process may be expected
to improve general prospecting results
when appropriately applied to the job.
So far as W.A. is concerned, the new
finds have not been a fair return for the
energy expended by prospectors operat-
ing under the old methods. Small plants
capable of drilling to a depth of 100 ft. or
so are worth a trial.
* H= * *
North Kalgurli’s latest estimate of ore
reserves affords a pleasing calculation for
shareholders. Reserves are set down at
.325,000 tons of lOdwt. ore, plus 25,000
tons of Bdwt. Taking gold at 7s. 6d.
per dwt., Australian currency, a figure
pleasing to the bulls results. A vigorous
development policy is being continued.
* * * *
In sampling and crushing trial parcels
from its Wiluna show, Granites Develop-
ment Co is dissecting no wild cat. The
mine is in the big Wiluna ore channel,
which, together with the favorable
appearance of its ore exposures, justifies
the present investigation.
* * * *
Golden Horseshoe (New), Ltd., which
is re-treating the Golden Horseshoe dump,
has practically dealt with half of the 2\
million short tons which the dump is
estimated to contain. Values have been
about 7s. per ton, but from now on
they will probably decrease. A pump
has been installed to carry tailings from
the south dump, which is now being
treated in conjunction with the main
dump. The enterprise has attracted
attention to many other tailing dumps
in the State. Great Boulder Pty.’s heap
contains about the same tonnage and
about £1,750,000-worth of gold. This
will probably be tackled in the near
future by the owners.

Great Boulder Prop, has always had
a penchant for taking options, but, so
far, has been out of luck in this depart-
ment. Its latest venture at Grant’s Patch
looks well on the surface, where
ore is exposed, but the vendors have re-
served mining rights to a depth of 100 ft.
A dual occupancy such as this is full of
possibilities. The Boulder Prop, is sink-
ing three shafts to a depth of 150 ft., and,
should the good surface showing con-
tinue to that point, the co.’s luck in the
option line can be regarded as changed.

South Kalgurli Consolidated reports
further promising developments on the
1200 ft. level of the Croesus Proprietary,
at the northern end of the Golden Mile,
in the formerly-despised calc schist coun-
try. Over width of 9ft. in the north drive
14dwt. values were secured.

H. Mandelstamm has applied for
further exemptions on the Tindals leases
at Coolgardie. These have been privi-
leged for three years, and local prospec-
tors have opposed further exemptions.
The exemption question is agitating pros-
pectors in W.A. since it was announced
that 1,153,000 acres are under reserva-
tion. Some exemptions are justified;
others are not.

The main shaft on the lease optioned
by the Ora Banda Co. is down 105 ft.,
while a second shaft is being sunk by
contractors. About 300: tons from the
property will be crushed shortly and a re-
turn of £3OOO is expected, which, with
the £6OOO previously secured, would pay
for the mine. It is practically certain
that the company will exercise its option.

Metals Investigation Pty., of Mel-
bourne, which is developing several leases
optioned from the Imperial Mining Co.,
as well as the Lake View South, ajl at
the southern end of the Golden Mile,
has now taken an option on the Croesus
South, known as the Paringa Extended,
which adjoins the North Kalgurli Central
lease at the northern end of the Mile.
At the southern end of the field con-
tinuous assays are revealing some high-

Adelaide-controlled Dundas Co. has
resumed operations on the Westralian
gold-mining venture over which it has an
option, and Which it tried to sell to
another concern. A Kalgoorlie metal-
lurgist has advised the board to go in
for selective mining, purchase a small
mill, and from the proceeds of crush-
ings pay for the mine. What then?
Silence is observed regarding permanency
of values at depth.

Reported that a prominent company
promoter, representing English capital,
has taken an option over the old Bulletin
group of leases, six miles west of Broad
Arrow (W.A.). Indications from leaders
on the surface are that valuable lodes
exist at depth. Several areas in the
vicinity have been taken up.

Princess Royal, Westonia (W.A.),
crushed 554 tons in July for 380 fine
ounces. On the No. 5 level, 110 ft. east

Westralian State batteries, so helpful
to small mineowners outback, now handle
about 10 p.c. of the gold ore treated in
the State, and their output is increasing.
In the six months ended June 30 they
crushed 44,000 tons, and the cyanide
plants leached 42,000 tons of residues, for
a total yield of 30,4250 z., worth over
£220,000. Owing to the small tonnages
treated operations showed a substantial
loss over many years; now that gold-
mining has revived, good profits are
being earned.
* * * *
The Reddie brothers, who have taken
over the old Sardine Tin mine, on the
Kangaroo Hills field (N.Q.), expect to
recoup themselves from treating the stulls,
etc., and hope to locate fresh ore. To
date the Sardine has yielded 1443 tons
of black tin, valued at £174,381, from
10,186 tons of ore. In dividends £62,000
was distributed. Some rich ore is being
discovered at Spring Creek, where crush-
ings are returning up to £3l per ton.

There have been some lode-mining and
production of quicksilver at the Kilkivan
(Q.) mines, and retorts are treating the
ore locally. Queensland Quicksilver, Ltd.,
has erected a sluicing plant, and as soon
as the water can be turned on arrange-
ments will be made to treat a large body
of cinnabar-bearing dirt.
$ * * *
Some of the old mines reopened in
the Eidsvold (Q.) district are attracting
attention. The Lady Augusta, a profitable
producer 20 years ago, has been taken
by a local syndicate, and a recent crush-
ings of 21 tons yielded 270 z. gold. The
reef averages sin. in width. Lady Rose,
Hollow Tooth, and Eye-Opener, all good
producers in the early days, also appear
to have good prospects, while at the Lady
Hilda a new reef, averaging lOin. in
width, has been struck at 45ft. Assays
have shown ounce stone. A Brisbane
syndicate is testing a dredging claim at
St. John’s Creek ; samples have given up
to 6gr. per cubic yard. Gold was first
discovered in the district in 1888 ; to date
over 100,000 oz. has been won.
* * *• *
An interesting new show in Queens-
land’s North Coast district is the Golden
Valley, 13 miles from Kilcoy, where
four new reefs, each a foot wide and
composed of quartz and iron gossan car-
rying bismuth and pyrites, have been
located. Two shafts have been sunk, and
a recent crushing of 15 tons yielded
1540 z. gold, valued at £5B. A three-head
stamper battery has been erected, and a
cyanide plant is being installed. The dis-
covery is on a spur running east from
Mount Somerset.
* * * *
The syndicate developing the Crescent
lease at May Downs, 30 miles from
Mount Isa (N.Q.), is highly pleased with
its trial crushing of 12 tons of bulk ore,
which returned (with the sands) £6 ss.
per ton. The shaft, now down 73ft., is
being sunk to 100 ft., when a crosscut
will be put through to pick up the big
reef exposed at the 45ft. level. Some
30 other claims are being worked in the
vicinity, but outside the Crescent area
there is nothing encouraging. The water
problem has been overcome ; the Gov-
ernment is supplying each man with 50
gallons per week from May Downs
station until a bore is put down on the
field.
* :|s *
At the Waverley mine, Woods Point
(Vic.), Tingha Tin, which formerly had
interests in Malaya, has driven 360 ft.
along the bottom level, and four floors
carrying payable ore have been met with.
A 10-head battery is now being erected.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
L.S.E.: Boulder Perseverance, and probably
Granite Development... .G.R.S.: No regular
market. Write to cos.’ secretaries, and ask for
them to be sold on a commission basis....
W.H.H.: (1) Cannot say. When bondholders
were circularised it was stipulated that those
who did not record a vote would be deemed
to have voted for the resolution. Whether such
methods would be upheld in a court of law is
another matter. (2) There might be; hang on
to them. (3) Cannot say.... August: Our
information is to the effect that it is one of the
few mines with prospects left; but, of course,
every mine is a gamble. Worth holding only
as a spec F.W.S.: (1) Hold on to the scrip;
there might be a few leavings for shareholders.
(2) Myers, Adelaide Cement, Swan Brewery.
. ...J.C.W.: (1) Hang on for a while. They
should recover more. (2) Can’t say A.M.S.:
Just a spec H.H.H.: They are still listed
on the Stock Exchange, but there have been
no recent dealings. Have no balance sheets.
Afraid they aren’t doing much.... Alexis: In-
tercolonial Investment and Land is one; can-
not speak in general terms for the others....
G. 8.: (1) You can take the paid-up policy, but
there are better offices than the other. (2)
Think all assets were absorbed in paying credi-
tors... .E.C.P.: Leave the proposition alone.
The method of finance is dangerous... .F.E.M.:
Not listed on Sydney ’Change... .F.E.G.: A
fair spec..... Queensland: Not an investment
at all—a spec. References to co. have all been
of a topical nature. But accounts are due
shortly, and may be reviewed.... Sucker: Leave
them alone.


SHADOW SHOWS.
“The Kiss Before the Mirror,” at the
Regent, is a queer blend of modern real-
ism and old-time artificiality. An
Edwardian theatre audience would have
been shocked by the story, and it would
have applauded the acting, for the story
is rather like life, and much of the act-
ing isn’t.
Paul Lukas is the adoring husband of
Gloria Stewart. He is watching her get-
ting ready to go out when it suddenly
dawns on him that she is making all these
elaborate preparations for the benefit of
a lover. He follows her, finds he was
right, and shoots her. Frank Morgan,
his best friend, undertakes his defence,
listens to his story, and for the first
time conceives a hideous suspicion. He
goes home to find his own wife (Nancy
Carroll) getting ready to go out. She sits
before her mirror, makes herself up, is
resentful when he kisses her, flits away
joyfully—all as described by his friend.
He follows and sees her with her lover.
The drama derives from his emotions
while defending one for whom he now
has a poignant fellow-feeling, and from
his wife’s growing terror as she realises
that he knows all, and means to kill
her if there is an acquittal.
Paul Lukas overacts ridiculously as the
accused. In real life murderers maintain
an appearance of stony indifference. The
director of “Manslaughter” invented an
effective device which enabled him to get
away from the stage tradition of an
accused person blubbering and gesticulat-
ing throughout a trial, while indicating
the horrors of the dock ; Claudette Col-
bert sat wooden-faced, as men and
women in her position may be seen doing
in courts all over the world, and her
anguished thoughts were revealed in the
background. Since then, unfortunately,
directors have reverted to the tradition
which shows homicides tearing their hair
and behaving in other respects as Lukas
does in this show: The emotionalism of
Frank Morgan as the defending counsel
is equally unreal.
The melodramatic behavior- of the
men appears more marked by reason of
the sophisticated naturalism of the
women. Nancy Carroll portrays to the
life one of those butterfly wives who take
lovers because it is the fashion in their
set, from a desire for excitement, be-
cause their minds are unoccupied by
children or domestic worries—in short,
for almost any reason but love. Being
a wife of the sort, she is more than ready
to be reconciled to her husband when
he decides to see her point of view and
make it up; and the fade-out leaves her
a reformed character —till the next good-
looking young man comes along. No-
thing unpleasant happens to either of the
lovers.
“From Arizona to Broadway” is a
farce in which James Dunn plays a con-
fidence man who sets out to swindle
Joan Bennett with the assistance of Her-
bert Mundin and a couple of half-witted
colleagues. In the course of their wan-
derings they collide with a rival gang of
crooks, but Mr. Dunn gets away with the
money and is inspired by love to hand
it to the rightful owner. Herbert Mun-
din is disappointing despite his five-gallon
hat and the fact that he is virtually the
star. If this is the best America can
do with him it seems a pity he left Eng-
land. The humor is of the catastrophic
type—characters being chased with
hatchets, bombarded with bricks, frozen
stiff in a refrigerator and so on.

Edw. G. Robinson holds the centre
of the stage for about three-quarters of
“Silver Dollar.” With his wife and infant
son he joins the gold rush to Colorado
in the ’seventies. Acting on her advice
he sets up a store, “grubstakes” the
miners, and when silver is found becomes
rich and a successful politician. At this
stage he deserts his wife for the inevit-
able blonde, and in the face of strong
opposition is appointed to the Senate.
Only the Presidentship remains when
silver, the basis of his fortune, is de-
monetised.
Aline MacMahon, as the wife, and
Bebe Daniels, as the blonde, provide
an effective background to his mono-
logues. It’s a better picture than the
Haymarket has had for months, and
Robinson is chiefly responsible.
“Ebb Tide” is a Surreyside bellow-
drama in movie form. Most of the char-
acters are East-Enders, and George Bar-
raud is a sailor. While his sweetheart is
in gaol he marries an orphan girl. Things
look bad when the other lady finds out,
but in these cases lawless passion always
gives way to innocence, so poor Cassie
duly leaves the scene showering bless-
ings on all and sundry.
FLASHES FROM THE FLICKERS.
(1) Jack Holt in “The Woman I Stole”
at Sydney Capitol. (2) Cicely Court-
neidge and (3) her mother (also her-
self) at Sydney Plaza in “Soldiers
of the King” with (4 and 5) Edward
Everett Horton. (6) From “Lucky
Number” on the same bill. (7) Paul
Lukas in “The Kiss Before the
Mirror” at Sydney Regent.
Cicely Courtneidge is the vitalising ele-
ment in “Soldiers of the King” at the
Plaza. She doubles the parts of Maisie
Marvello, “queen” of a troupe of music-
hall artistes, and Jenny Marvello, Maisie’s
mother, the ex-“queen.” An adagio
dancer (Dorothy Hyson) joins up, and in
defiance of discipline and custom falls
in love with a guardsman (Anthony
Bushell). The rest of the troupe, especi-
ally old Jenny, are unkind, but the
“queen” stands by her. Eventually she
gets her guardsman, and the “queen”
realises the worth of Sebastian (Edward
Everett Horton), her stage manager,
who has been proposing for 15 years.
Cicely Courtneidge is always to the
fore —in male impersonations, a bur-
lesque of an adagio dance, vocal numbers
and straight-out clowning—but there are
others. Eddie Horton is brilliant as
usual, and Herschel Henlere, Bransby
Williams and Olive Sloane do good work.
“The Lucky Number” introduces Clif-
ford Mollison as an impulsive foot-
baller who is ordered off for attacking
a spectator. Down on his luck, he trades
a French lottery ticket for drinks and
then learns that it is the first-prize
winner. The best part of the film is
taken up with his efforts to recover it.
Having done so, he finds that the lottery
promoter has absconded, so he returns
to football. The humor is wearisome on
the whole. Gordon Harker, as a publi-
can, is one of the redeeming features.
** { *
In “Best of Enemies,” at the Capitol,
a gallant attempt is made to construct
a romance on the theme of the legal re-
turn to America of very small beer. The
action takes place in and around a Ger-
man conservatorium, local color for
which seems to have been exclusively
gleaned from “Old Heidelberg” and “The
Student Prince.” Buddy Rogers is a
bright, young German-American, and his
dad is Frank Morgan. He loves Marian
Nixon, whose German-American papa is
Joseph Cawthorn. Much of the technique
is so raw as to suggest a throw-back to
the silents of 1910. A jazz composition
supplies the musical flavor of Leipzig, or
wherever in Germany the absurdities are
supposed to happen. The effect on the
average film fan is to engender a wish
that Hollywood had stuck to its good old
bootlegger.
There is better stuff, but, alas! without
a trace of a new idea, in “The Woman
I Stole.” Jack Holt, who every day and
in every way becomes more reminiscent
of Benito Mussolini, Eric Campbell and
Adolf Hitler, goes through his paces in
his timeworn role of the mine-manager
in tropic parts who foils the wicked
machinations of Edwin Maxwell. Noah
Beery is General Rayon, a half-caste
bandit, and Fay Wray provides the sex-
interest. It isn’t surprising to learn, in
the denouement, that all the gentlemen
concerned find they can live without her.
The brightest ray in the subsidiary pro-
gramme is a speech by Federal Minister
White, in which he congratulates an Aus-
tralian movie magnate on his enterprise
and remarks, “I saw the squatter’s daugh-
ter partially shot.”
Sundry Shows
“Private Lives” was short-lived at
Melb. King’s. Noel Coward’s comedy
ends to-night (16th) and Peter Dawson
begins on Saturday. “The Quaker Girl”
will also be turned out shortly from the
Royal to face the most rigorous winter
in local theatrical memory. On Satur-
day “Tout Paris” fades from the Prin-
cess, and the only moderately cheering
news for Poverty-Pointers is that Theo
Shall, having rallied his shattered forces,
has reappeared on the Palace front with
Maria von Dyl, Margot Rys, Norman
Shepherd, William Ralston and other
local reinforcements. “Fair Exchange,”
by Bruno Frank, will be the subject of
his first offensive; zero hour, 8 p.m.
Saturday.

What looks like a belated locking of
the stable-door after Pegasus has de-
parted is the formation in Melbourne of
the Australian Drama League, to which
all other similar societies are invited to
connect themselves. The aims of the
league are the usual ones, plus a grandi-
ose-looking scheme for the erection of a
national theatre. The theatrical prole-
tariat, it is admitted even by amateur
theatricians, left for the movie houses
long ago; what doesn’t seem to be
realised is that the bulk of the intelli-
gentsia have followed them. Amongst
the last-named are numbers of people
who thirst, as they did at the legitimate
theatre fount, for the pure water of Heli-
con, and they don’t get it. If the A.D.L.
tried in a modest way the experiment
of a film repertory theatre it would be
doing these people a service.

Something exotic will be on the bill of
fare of Marshall Sumner, the Australian
pianist who returned from U.S.A. the
other day and will pound the piano at
the Central Hall, Melbourne, three nights
this week, commencing Thursday. It is a
“Sona'tina Transatlantique” by Tansman,
and its movements are marked “Foxtrot,”
“Spiritual and Blues” and “Charleston.”

Mayne Linton, who declaimed Mase-
field’s “Everlasting Mercy” at St. James’s
Hall, Sydney, the other night, while
Nancye Stewart did a sotto voce
storm with Liszt’s B Minor Sonata, man-
aged to convince his audience that there
was some affinity in the musical and
literary fare provided. The gentleman
has a nice voice and a sense of drama,
and Liszt was kept so much in Mase-
field’s background that he didn’t matter
much anyway. As a curtain-raiser some
of Mr. Linton’s pupils in the art of
drama presented Suderman’s one-acter
“The Faraway Princess” with fair success.

The Cesar Franck quartette, played
publicly for the first time in Sydney, has
all the richness of harmony that could be
expected from a composer who spent
so much of his life on ah organ stool,
and its reminiscent quality, conveyed by
a judicious use of motifs that pervade
the whole panorama, is restful rather
than stimulating. Sydney Con. quartet-
tists played it as if they found its restful-
ness a bit overpowering. The Delius work
that figured on the same programme is
a horse of a more skittish breed, but it
was made to caracole with a docility
that suggested too heavy a hand on the
rein. A bright relief was the singing by
Madame Goossens-Viceroy of a group
of French songs, accompanied by Mar-
jorie Hesse.
# * *
The Perth Repertory Club opened its
new and comfy private theatre with a
three-nights’ season of one-act plays and
with speeches by Lieut.-Gov. Mitchell,
Dr. Battye and its first president, Arthur
Male. Enthusiastic cries of “Author!”
greeted Albert Kornweibel’s “Enter Mel-
pomene,” which opened the programme.
Back-pats for the evening went to Olive
Dean’s production of Wallace, Bell’s
“Symphony in Illusion,” Dorothy
Powell’s Mad Girl in the same show, and
Percy Cannot’s Max in Schnitzler’s “A
Farewell Supper.”
The Palette.
Maude Sherwood, a Maorilander who
has a show of water-colors at Macquarie
Galleries (Sydney), is the equivalent in
art of what is meant when it is said of
a writer that he’s an “authors’ author.”
She has no tricks of technique—tricksters
of technique are futile —but a faculty of
making every line, every shade of color
tell a straightforward story. With a few
brush-strokes she conveys the crunchiness
of snow; the oleaginous reflections of
tidal water ; such difficult complexities as
the suggesting of distance and altitude
in a shore scene, looking out to sea. Her
treatment of color is the sort of thing
before which mere words curl up into
their shells. There isn’t a synonym in
the whole of Roget’s “Thesaurus” that
exactly gets it. “Gorgeous” and “strik-
ing” won’t fit, and “appropriate” is too
drab. The nearest approach to an expres-
sion is conveyed in the analogy of the
old Indian colonel who said, “Give me
a soldier correctly dressed and looking
like a soldier, and dammit ! I could look
at him for half a day without getting
bored! ” Mrs. Sherwood has been com-
pared, by way of compliment, with many
of the gods of “modern” art. The char-
acteristic that distinguishes her from these
deities is that she can draw.
The exhibition of the Contemporary
Group at the Fine Arts, Melbourne, is
a fresh outburst of modernism, this time
by the masters instead of the pupils.
George Bell serves Arnold Shore badly
scrambled. Frater and Shore in their
landscapes approach closest to the variety
and freedom of Nature when they don’t
allow their enthusiasm for seeing pat-
terns in her to get the better of them.
Most of the work, however, is only mildly
eruptive, like measles. Still, the Contem-
poraries’ little jokes are more amusing
than the photographic realism of William
Rowell at the Athenaeum.
Strength and virility are the main
features of Horace Trenerry’s show at
the Argonaut Gallery in Adelaide. This
critic, jammed against what looked like
a solid anthill in flames, was relieved, on
getting away to visibility-point, to find it
a perfectly good wheatsheaf, in shadow,
with the ears of corn catching the sun-
light. Trenerry’s work is like that. He
chucks it at you—but he gets the effect.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Cairo”: Paddy O’Callaghan, although
a bad farmer, was a good salesman. I
saw him selling a cow one day. “Will
she give two gallons?” asked the buyer.
She would. “Will she give six gallons
then?” She would. “Well, will she
give 16 gallons?” “Sure now,” said
Paddy, “she is a nice little cow, and she’ll
give it if she has it.”
* * * *
“O W. Waireki”: At docking time,
Henare got work with sheep-farmer
Mac Skinflint. A week later I noticed
the native back at the pah. “I get sick
an’ tired of Mac’s two-up,” he explained
when he saw me. “Nothing but two-up
every night.” “You used to be very fond
of the game,” I remarked. “Game?” he
echoed. “It not a game at Mac’s —it a
mean man’s stew: two fish heads an’
two lambs’ tails.”

“Dr. Nil”: I have often wondered
which is the stupidest thing possessing a
central nervous system —a sheep, a hen
or the average man. I’m now prepared to
put my money on the hen. While I
was sitting on a back verandah a little
white leghorn came wandering by, look-
ing for the way to the henroost. There
were three ways, all close together:
through a wicket gate with palings eight
inches apart; along the verandah and
down the main steps; over a two-foot
trellis topped by wire-netting. The fowl
chose the last. Mounting the taffrail of the
trellis, so to speak, it tried to push itself
through the two-inch meshes; not to fly
PEDESTRIAN: “Sorry, Dig.! ”
over the netting, as it had been well able
to do. Failing to accomplish this after
many trials, it dismounted and passaged
up and down before the wicket gate,
looking through the eight-inch spaces
but never attempting to enter. It then
walked half-way to the steps and turned
back and mounted the trellis again, nearly
tumbling over the top of the wicket in
doing so, and resumed the effort of
squeezing through the netting. With
slight variations in the order of proceed-
ings that chook continued going its
idiotic rounds for about 20 minutes be-
fore I got up and shooed it along the
verandah to the main steps, which it then
marched solemnly down, looking as
proud as Christopher Columbus.
* * * *
“Beefo”: Overlanding from the N.T. to
Queensland, we had a mob of bullocks
that, once clear of Binghi’s domain and
free from small spearing raids, grew quite
peaceful at nights. Then the horse-tailer
pulled out, and an abo. was given the
job. Those bullocks must have remem-
bered the smell or the sight of the black
spear-throwers. Our abo. had been on
watch barely ten minutes when the mob
went; we got the lead three days later
40 miles away.
*■ * * #
“Eirwal”: I have proved to my own
satisfaction that crows can count —up to
three, at any rate. A
dead sheep was skinned
and the carcass left
in a paddock at
a convenient rifle-
shot distance from
a shed. Some crows
were soon attracted,
and one of my friends
went into the shed with
a rifle. The crows saw
him and decided to
postpone their visit. So
another friend went
into the shed and the
first one came out. The
cunning crows stayed
out of rifle shot. Then
three went into the
shed and two came out,
but still the crows kept
out of range. Then
four of us went in and
three left. At this stage
the crows’ adding
mechanism refused to
function further.
Thinking there was no
one left in the shed they dived on to the
meat, getting a terrible fright when one
of their number dropped dead.

“The Breaker”: “The only animals
I cares a cuss fer,” said Delaney, “is a
fat bullick, a good sheep dawg an’ a good
horse on a draftin’ camp. See that ole
chestnut horse there? That fellow’s the
daddy of ’em all. An orphan, he is,
weaned on the bottle at Mulga Downs,
an’ I broke him in meself. I’ll tell yer
what brains that ole horse has. We was
cuttin’ out fats ter send away, an’ though
I tried ter get a big roan bullick out
half a dozen times, that ole horse
wouldn’t try a yard. Then all of a sud-
den I tumbled. That roan bullick was
a milker’s calf; him an’ me horse had
been brought up together on the same
cow’s milk. They was foster-brothers!”
“E.S.”: Daddy Fawcett, a pioneer
squatter of the Richmond River (N.S.W.),
was always willing to give a hand to any-
body he found in difficulties. While rid-
ing along a timber track he came upon
a strenuously-exhorting teamster whose
log-laden truck was bogged to its axles.
“That language, Joe, is only insulting the
poor beasts,” Daddy remarked reprov-
ingly. Joe scratched his head in despair.
“What’s a man to do?” he asked. Daddy
went along the string from leaders to
polers, patting each bullock and speak-
ing softly to it. Then he raised the whip
and delivered a fluent oration that Joe
couldn’t understand, but to his surprise
the bullocks bent to the yokes and drew
the load on to firm ground. Joe stood
with his mouth open till the team was
halted. “Well, boss,” he said then, “your
language beats mine. Never heard the
like of it.” “That’s Latin,” Fawcett ex-
plained, and went on his way congratu-
lating himself on the advantages of a
classical education.
* * * *
“Sylvia”: A party from Sydney
camped at Mt. Victoria, Blue Mountains,
laid a ghost that has scared others in the
same vicinity. They had been told of
strange screams and groans heard at the
camping-place, but reckoned that owls or
’possums were responsible. They dropped
that notion abruptly when they were
wakened about 1 a.m. by a weird, shud-
dering shriek, which rose in a crescendo,
“Where’s yer ’usband?”
“S-s-stop a moment and I’ll call him. He’s under the bedclothes .”
only to be followed by deep sobs. That
noise certainly wasn’t caused by any liv-
ing bush thing. While whispered conjec-
tures were being bandied, one of the lads
of the party commenced to chuckle.
“There’s your ghost!” he cried, pointing
to two tall gums, plainly outlined in the
moonlight. As they watched, the great
bough of one touched a bough of the
other, swayed by the light night wind.
As pressure increased a whistling screech
arose, and as it was relaxed the boughs
“chattered” gently together, producing
the sobbing sound.
* * * *
“Erua”: Is the ordinary domestic fowl
impervious to poison? Dad, returning
from laying strychnine baits, was hailed
by the family and invited to bowl at the
local Bradman. He put the tin of strych-
nine and jam on the grass and took the
ball. Two hens immediately rushed up
and began a hearty meal on the mixture.
They were caught and locked up, and
their early demise was looked for. A
month later both were still in the best of
health. In another case a bottle of an
arsenic compound used for spraying was
dropped in a drain, where fowls arrived
and ate lumps of the poison before it
could be removed. They also suffered
no ill effects. If strychnine and arsenic
won’t kill a chook, what will?
“Cuchulain”: “Elaps” (B. 2/8/’33) is
too positive in his assertion that reptiles
can’t bite themselves to death. Here are
my two experiences of snake
suicide, which satisfied me as
to their venom. Both cases
were in s.-w. Queensland. A
small grey night snake with a
black head was found in a
posthole while a yard was
being put up. It was in no
mood for the teasing sticks
which were dropped in, and
suddenly bit itself above the
tail and was dead in a few
minutes. It measured about a
foot long. The second suicide
was that of a death adder.
Someone threw a tent peg at
it. The missile only just touched the
adder’s back, and quick as lightning the
snake reared over, bit its own back and
was dead in a few seconds.
# * * *
“Craquer”: To catch fish with spare
lines and hooks enough attached to stock
a tackle shop is a commonplace, but a
Macleay River (N.S.W.) fisherman struck
something new recently. When he hauled
in he found he had hooked a large eel
with a short length of line adhering to
it. To this was fastened an empty
corked bottle which, by the look of it,
had been towed about in the water for
a long time, though the eel was fat and
hearty. Setting “trimmers” with empty
bottles for floats used to be a favorite
method of fishing for Murray cod, the
bottles with line and bait being thrown in
overnight, to be picked up in the morn-
ing from a boat. With a short line there
was no fear of snagging, and the bottle
float soon tired the fish and prevented
him wandering.
* * * *
“Groper”: Reference in a recent Bul-
letin to dressmaking for the gins on a
Fitzroy River (W.A.) station recalls
W.A.’s first attempt to clothe her dusky
daughters. Governor John Hutt, of the
’forties, was a bachelor, and it shocked
his sensibilities to encounter aboriginal
ladies strolling around Perth minus even
the traditional fig-leaf. So, requisitioning
a bolt of print from the Government
stores, he called a sewing bee of civil
servants’ wives, etc., and requested the
construction of a few dozen Mother
Hubbards. This done, all the gins in the
place were summoned to the Govern-
ment church, from which they emerged
clothed and presumably happy. All were
then marshalled to Government House,
where, in the presence of the sewing bee,
his Ex. inspected them approvingly.
He was impressing on his subjects
the necessity of keeping themselves pro-
perly clothed when, from the near-by Mt.
Eliza, came wild calls which signified
that the bucks of the tribe had returned
to camp and were demanding the missus.
Instantly the gins started to sprint for
home. But a few strides convinced them
that there was no speed in clothes, and
like one woman they peeled off, leaving
his Ex. breathing hard amidst a score
of ladies, married and single, who were
not sure whether to laugh or blush. But
worse was to follow. Within a few days
all the bucks were wearing the dresses.
* * * *
“Pick”: About the fighting weight of
a flock pigeon, speckled brown and grey,
with long green legs and a long curved
beak, sea curlews are the most elusive
of wild game birds. They are migratory
and only found rarely in twos or threes
on the N.S.W. coast, but their numerous
overhead cries by night indicate that at
times large mobs of them are passing
northward. The wariest of birds, they
fly extremely high—far out of gunshot
reach —and they alight only at the end
of a far-projecting sandspit, where a
hunter cannot approach unseen. The
chance of potting one comes only to
the chap who can faithfully mimic the
birds’ wild whistling call. The migrants
wheel back and swoop when they hear
that distressful wail below.
* * * *
“Larrapinta”: Any textbook upon eth-
nology, could have told “Wainui” (B.
2/8/’33) why the Maoris and other native
races put three fingers instead of five on
their carvings of the human figure. All
held a belief of this sort: “This is a repre-
sentation of a man such as I; if I make a
perfect copy it will have a spirit which
will haunt me, or my spirit may pass
into it if it is too like me. So I shall make
it imperfect.”
* * * *
“Roo”: An unusual bridge is being
constructed at Indooroopilly (Q.). Sink-
ing for an anchorage for the suspension
cables workmen found stone showing
free gold, which assayed well. The
builder’s main concern, however, is to
complete his contract, and as the stone
is very suitable for concrete he is using
it in the foundations. He has taken a
lease of eight acres, which should cover
any lode in the vicinity, and when the
bridge is complete he will turn his atten-
tion to mining.
THE TRACKS TO FURTHER OUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Beside the dumps of Long Ago again the camp-
fires burn;
Along the tracks to Further Out again the
glad wheels turn.
The same old call is heard once more as when,
with hearts aglow,
We took the tracks to Further Out in days of
Long Ago.
But nowadays each look ahead and every
glance behind
Would waken some old memory to wreck our
peace of mind.
Unheeded goes the call, in vain the siren song
is sung,
For those who went to Further Out when all
the world was young.
And yet, when all is said and done, and said
and done again,
There might be something worth the cost along
those tracks of pain.
For it might be that we would find, to end our
fear and doubt,
The strength, the hope, the pride, the faith we
left at Further Out.

“Rotom”: If Alsatian dogs are to be
banned because they may mate with
dingoes, the net should include other
breeds of sporting dogs. At Kybean cattle
station in the Jingera country (N.S.W.),
a valued staghound, inveigled by a lady
dingo, adopted jungle life for good and
all. He became chief marauder of the
station runs, and for many years an
almost nightly killer of sheep and calves.
His many descendants still roam the Jin-
geras—a tribe noted for speed, cunning
and ferocity—but as yet there has been
no outcry against staghounds.
* * * *
“Plankton”: Ever hear of an insect-
catching grass? A not uncommon species
named Cenchrus australis reaches a
height of about 2ft., the stem terminat-
ing in a seed-stalk 6in. long. Distributed
along the stalk are some 80 seed-burrs,
each surrounded by hundreds of prickly
hairs armed with numerous sharp back-
ward-directed spines. Even large insects
such as powerful beetles are perfectly
helpless when entangled, as the barbed
hooks never let go. The luckless victims
are of no possible benefit to the grass,
as it is not carnivorous like the sticky
sundews, the prickly teasel and similar
types of insect traps. This grass is found
along the coastal belt from northern
N.S.W. to North Queensland.

“C. Coral”: “Yes,” remarked Jimmy
Susu, “that chensus paper he proper big

fore. But me, I got plenty yarn for

chensus man he been ask me. I been
forgot tell him about piccaninny what
them ’nother man take from me [adop-
tion], and I lose married paper, too. My
word, that chensus man he laugh too
much, make me blanky fool, when I tell
him age belong me more than 20 I tink,
and he say ‘Where this son belong you
come from what you been tell me he
18 year old?’ ’Nother ting, he want know
how much room my house got, and how
much people he sleep along that baranda.
My house he got altogether one room
and one baranda —that baranda he no
finish yet, I got make floor. Which way
I going count people what sleep along
that baranda?”

“Raeakiaki”: Kite-flying contests were
as common in pre-pakeha Maoriland as
raiding expeditions, and the kites flown
were huge affairs capable of climbing to
a great height. A bird-like one with a
wing spread of from 12ft. to 15ft. ranked
as first favorite. It consisted of a frame-
work of manuka, covered first with the
long-bladed toi-toi (Mariscus ustulatus )
and then with gaily colored feathers, a
human-like head, hollow and containing
shells (to set up a rattle) and short legs.
Next in point of popularity came the
large triangular kite, made of raupo
leaves secured to a light frame of rods;
it was flown sometimes with the apex
uppermost. Smaller, and mainly for the
use of kids, were oval-, lozenge- and
cruciform-shaped kites. The Maori ex-
pert rarely attached a long tail to his kite,
using instead bunches of feathers and
small projecting rods. When a kite
mounted steadily skywards it was a good
omen; when it didn’t, disaster threatened.

“Soso”: “Peter Quince” says (B.
26/7/’33), “I suppose a plantain tastes
much the same as a banana,” and lets it
go at that. The plantain is a banana, but
a special sort of one, and in the northern
State is very popular. At present it fetches
26/- per case wholesale. Roasted in its
skin, baked as a vegetable, or fried in
batter as a fritter, it is very palatable,
and it lacks the strong smell and mushi-
ness of the ordinary bananas. The flesh
is not so closely packed, having a kind
of “bloom” in it. Cut into small cubes,
the plantain makes as good a base for
fruit-salad as does the pawpaw.
* * * *
“Nakhoda”: The activities of the Mel-
bourne Animal Welfare League, which
was Mrs. Lort Smith’s baby, have grown
so extensively in the past three years that
it now has a salaried secretary, P. R.
Wingrove. The clinic for crippled dogs,
diseased horses and other unfortunate
fauna is as busy as the clinic for humans
DAD: “The sun doesn’t give us a fair go in the winter."
CHUM: “Naw; it be here to-day and gone to-morrow.”
at Melb. Hospital. Voluntary workers in
fur coats rush about and veterinary sur-
geons give their services free, like their
medical brothers. Over 24,000 animals
have been treated since 1930, and there
is now a day and night ambulance ser-
vice with an expert aboard and means
of putting incurable cases out of their
sufferings painlessly. A residential hos-
pital is contemplated; there is already
a city office. The service is supposed to
be for the needy, but that doesn’t prevent
well-lined people rolling up in limousines,
which are parked out of sight, and pre-
senting their pets for treatment.
“T.P.”: Why not leeches (B. 26/7/’33)?
Yesterday I tried three chemists’ shops,
to be met with pitying grins and patron-
ising remarks anent “relics of dark
ages.” Fifty years ago I was deaf after
continuous earache. Aubrey Bowen, of
Collins-street, then a leading aurist and
oculist, glanced into my ears, gasped
“Oh!” and packed me off to a chemist,
who ladled out a dozen leeches. In ten
minutes the wrigglers were pumping out
treacly stuff, as black as the boxer hat
of those days, from behind my ears.
“Had that blood congealed,” Bowen said,
“an operation would have been neces-
sary, and only one in 200 is successful.”
I have had a good time for the half-
century, thanks to my squirming saviours.

“Homfrey Beale”: A legend round
Alice Springs and some other parts of
Centralia is that of the “barking spider.”
It is said to live in colonies in shallow
burrows, and to bay long and rau-
cously, solo, duet and. community.
Baldwin Spencer investigated these stories
in 1901, and reached the conclusion that
the noise (which he heard, and which he
says was more of a “booming” than a
“barking”) was made by a bird; prob-
ably some sort of quail. He went on to
say, however, that on the flat where the
sounds occurred there were numerous
burrows from which he dug spiders of
unusual size. Some he kept, and on
teasing one with a piece of straw it
emitted a “slight but distinctly audible
whistling sound.” He found it had a
series of spines on the mandible that
could be rubbed across a row of keys on
the palp, making a stridulating noise.
* * * *
“Hermon”: I disagree with “M.G.”
(B. 19/7/’33) in his criticism of the trans-
fer of Capt. Cook’s house from York-
shire to Australia. On purely artistic
grounds such transfer would have been
indefensible. On sentimental grounds —
as the place was for sale and probable
demolition —Australia has a right to
it, for to this cottage Cook went
on his return to England after the
Endeavour voyage. For Australians
visiting England there are still buildings
associated with Cook’s childhood and
youth in Yorkshire: the church in
Marton, where he was baptised; the
school he attended in Great Ay ton; the
house in Grape-lane, Whitby, where he
lived ashore during his apprenticeship
to the Quaker Walker brothers.
* * * *
Plankton”: If bees could talk, one
might surmise that the approach of even-
ing would elicit the inquiry “Where are
you hanging out to-night?” Some species
of our solitary bees (particularly Halic-
tus and Andrenus ) actually hang them-
selves up for the night. Their idea of
preparing for a comfortable night’s rest
is to take a firm grip with their jaws on
a leaf or light twig, test it for a moment,
withdraw their legs, and swing by their
heads until morning. They can’t talk in
their sleep. Only the males have this
queer habit. The females repose sensibly
at the entrances of their burrows, with
their heads blocking the openings.
* * * ■ *
“Dai R.”: One of the most persistent
spooks of the bush is that of a Chinaman
supposed to haunt the now-almost-
deserted diggings of Pine Creek. He is
after the scalp of the last of the
Wai-Willum tribe. When a young man in
China he lost all his people by plague,
taking over from the last-surviving one
a debt of gratitude to be paid to another
family, the penalty of non-payment being
eternal unrest for the debtors. The legatee
renounced his lady-love and other bright
prospects and came to Australia in search
of the needed amount He had accumu-
lated it at Pine Creek, and was preparing
to return and discharge the debt, when
he was murdered and eaten by some
of the Wai-Willums. A few half-castes
of the tribe that still remain go in terror
of what they call “yeller feller ghost.”

“Cuchulain”: “Du Barrier” (B.
26/7/’33) must possess the claws of a
harpy or fall on his pigs with his teeth.
I’ve never seen the hand that could hold a
pig by the ears. “Piggie” Cook, who used
to catch hundreds in the Goondiwindi
(Q.) district, needed a dog on each ear of
his quarry before he tied it up. He used
to rail them to Toowoomba or Warwick
for bacon, and they fetched up to 10s.
apiece. Another chap laid them out with
a stout myall waddy, but one day an old
boar chewed most of his hand off. In
’97, when a 2s. 6d. bonus was offered on
snouts in the same district, five of us
killed 90 in an afternoon, mounted on
horses and armed with shear-blades
secured to good sticks.
* * * *
“Si Anu”: Kuala Lumpur (F.M.S.) has
the queerest traffic enactment in exist-
ence. Bothered by having to chase in-
numerable cases of theft, the police
ordained that no pushbike might be left
unattended, and prosecuted numerous
offenders. Syces are comparatively cheap
in Malaya, but owners of cycles are won-
dering how they can carry round a six-
foot bearded Sikh as watchman when
they want to leave their machines on the
sidewalk.
* * * sfc
“Kolmac”: “Mudlark” (B. 5/7/’33)
tells some artistic lies about the divining-
rod business. I advance my contribution
to the discussion as a chunk of solid fact.
There is a man here (Calliope, Q.) who,
when I found a reef, offered to trace
it, thus saving me a considerable amount
of dead work. He got to work with
his wire contraption and said, “You have
two reefs here, merging into one at about
30ft.” I was sceptical, but I put in a
long cut and found two reefs where he
said they were. Of the second there was
no surface indication. After rain I tried
the gully further down to see if there
was a shed of alluvial, and bottomed at
five feet and no wash. The diviner said
I was about six feet off the deep ground.
I sank exactly where he said and went
nine feet to bottom. That’ll do me.
* * * *
“A.M.R.” (New Hebrides): In June,
at White Sands, Tanna, a perfectly sea-
worthy ship’s dinghy, in good order,
safely navigated the coral reef and landed
on the only safe bit of beach for miles,
either way. Painted black and lined
throughout, this 15ft.-by-6ft. unnamed
stranger is very strongly built. From the
look of her she had been adrift for some
time. She was half-full of water in
which swam fish of a deep-water variety
not known to Tommy Tanna. It took
eight boys to shift her up the beach.
Where she came from, and how, is being
inquired into through the usual channels,
and if no owners turn up the usual pro-
cedure will be followed. Local legal
opinion (beach) is that salvage cannot be
claimed by the finder, owing to life
aboard when found.
* * * *
“Trevdee”: Vests, caps and shoes
made from calfskin are not entirely
novel, but a Melbourne slaughterman
recently surprised his mates by coming
to work in a full rigout of the hairy
material. Everything, excepting his cap
(which was from a black-and-white
Friesian), was made from the skins pre-
viously worn by some spotted Ayrshire
cross yearlings, and his get-up, however
startling, was certainly in entire confor-
mity with his calling.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: Visitors to Torres Strait
were always introduced to two in-
teresting characters —Passi, the mamoose
(chief) of Murray Island, and Maino,
mamoose of Yam, who served as orderly
to William MacGregor in Papua, and
proudly displays a row of medals. Old
Maino is now the last of the Island
chiefs. Passi, about 80, was gathered
to his fathers a few weeks ago, and
now sleeps in the cemetery by the beach
alongside John Bruce, the white official
who administered the law at Murray
for upwards of 40 years. In his earlier
days Passi had been initiated into the
mysterious cults of the Torres Strait
islanders, and could speak at first hand
on such subjects as the flavor of human
flesh and head-collecting. He remembered
raids made on his islands in the merry
days when ships had the run of the
Strait; it is on Murray, by the way,
that one of the villages, in native ter-
minology “Ulag,” commemorates by its
name the atrocities of the Woodlark in
the ’sixties. One of Passi’s sons, the
Rev. Poey Passi, is priest of the Anglican
mission in Torres Strait.
THE MADAMOZELLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The best little brig out of Falmouth Bay*
From her spanker boom to her tore-top-stay,
With lines as trim as a Portsmouth bel e;
And we used to call her the Madamozelle.
“Grumbling Jack” was her skipper’s name,
But a damned fine sailor-man, all the same.
The Madamozelle was his only joy;
And I was the poor damned loblolly-boy.
Five hundred ton was the Madamozelle,
And she’d weather a gale from Hull to Heh •
When the Old Man cracked on every stitch
She could sail close-hauled like a water-witch.
She’d linen cloths and manilla rope,
And bright-work polished with sand and soap;
Spars of Poon-tree, from Sarawak;
Decks milk-white and hull jet black.
And many a bale, and many a ton
That paid no duty, we used to run,
And revenue men fair piped their eye
When the Madamozelle went tearing by.
When the gale was aft, and the combers curled,
With only the roy’ls and t’gan’s’ls furled,
And the sea was white and the sky was black,
Ah! That was the weather for Grumbling Jack!
We’d roll and lurch and plunge and reel
With two men lashed to the wrenching wheel,
And the damned old skipper would shout with
glee
But it wasn’t much fun for the likes of me!
No watch below when the winds blew free,
And the Old Man yelled for his “Boston Tea”!
No bunk for me, with a blanket soft,
When the bos’n piped “All hands aloft!”
Well —now I’m old, and grim and grey,
And I’ve stood my trick and I’ve had my day,
Yet I reckon I still could do a spell
As loblolly-boy on the Madamozelle.
But she’s ashore, and so am I,
And her Old Man, too, all high-and-dry.
With broken masts and rigging rotten,
There she lies on the mud —forgotten!
And she looks a different kind of witch,
Water-logged in a mangrove ditch;
She —that was once her captain’s joy.
And me that was once her loblolly-boy.

Information Sought
(1) Dates upon which the Commonwealth
Bank made reductions in overdraft rates and
the extent of the reductions ? (2) How much
has the rate charged by the Commonwealth
Bank to the Governments for discounting of
Treasury Bills been reduced since 1929; also
the reduction in the rate paid by the Common-
wealth Savings Bank on deposits during the
same period ?—7356.
(1) General bank, rate at July 1, 1929, 6£
p.c.; rate altered on July 1, 1931, to 5£ p.c.;
on July 1, 1932, and on Jan. 1, 1933, 4| p.c.

We are three partners in a furniture-making
business, and wish to take out articles of part-
nership. We are informed that the necessary
documents cover eight sheets of foolscap and
the cost is £3. Would it not be just as binding
if we signed a simple document before a J.P.
stating that we agree to take one-third share
each of profits and liabilities? —7311.
No. Your “simple document” would not
contain many of the essential ingredients of a
legal partnership. Neither party would know
his exact relation to the other nor What responsi-
bility he carried.
Are boxing contests at Sydney Stadium or
elsewhere in N.S.W. governed by specified
rules ? —7362.
Boxing contests all over Australia are gov-
erned by Marquis of Queensberry rules. In
1913 “Snowy” Baker (then manager of the Syd-
ney Stadium) and others interested in the sport
drew up a set of regulations Which were called
“The Australian Boxing Rules,” which were
accepted here and there for a few years. They
were then discarded.
(1) / am a returned soldier with defective
sight, but otherwise fit. Would I conform to the
standard of physical fitness required by the
Commonwealth Public Service Board for
appointees ? (2) Is the medical examination
conducted by a doctor appointed by the board
or by the candidate’s own medical adviser ?
7052.
(1) When, in the opinion of the medical
officer, defective sight can be remedied by the
use of glasses, an appointee Would be per-
mitted to take up duty. (2) Generally, medical
examinations are conducted by the Common-
wealth Medical Officer for the district; other-
wise by a practitioner approved by the Public
Service Board.
Was there ever a pony express in connection
with the post office in Australia ?— 7402.
Yes. Before the completion (1871) of the
overland telegraph fine the gap between the
northern and southern sections was bridged by
pony express. Cable messages were sent to
Port Darwin, then by telegraph to Daly Waters.
Thence postal or telegraph messengers, mounted
on. relays of ponies, galloped to Tennant’s Creek,
whence the messages were wired to Adelaide.
(1) Did the Dutch ever attempt to colonise
Australia ? (2) With what result ? (3) Where
did the name Australia come from ?— 7408.
(1) and (2) Yes. In 1628 the Dutch Govern-
ment fitted out 10 ships and dispatched them
to form a settlement on the western shore of
Australia. Off the Cape of Good Hope gales
scattered the fleet and sank some of the vessels,
but the man-o’-war acting as convoy con-
tinued the voyage until she was wrecked 30
miles off the Australian coast. That ended
Dutch attempts at colonisation. (3) The name
was adopted from Tierra Australia del Espiritu
Santo, which is Spanish for the Southern Land
of the Holy Spirit, a name given by Quiros to
the island of Espiritu Santo, which he mistook
for the great continent.
How to brighten a fence with climbing plants
(flowers or vegetables ) which can be made pro-
fitable, and the names and varieties ? —7387.
Stay the fence with strands of galvanised-iron
fencing wire and fix wire-netting on it to which
the plants can be tied. Flowers suitable are
climbing roses, antignon, wistarias and sweet-
peas (all suitable for cut-flower trade); climb-
ing beans and chokos (vegetables); and grapes
and passionfruit.
(1) Was the first Sydney G.P.O. in Bent-
street ? (2) What sum was paid for the present
site ?— 7423.
(1) No. The first site was where the fire
brigade station stands at the corner of Circu-
lar Quay and George-street, A storekeeper
named Isaac Nicholls looked after the mails.
The next site was the present one, for a time.
Later the P.O. was in Bent-street, and, later
still, in Wynyard-square, while the present
structure was building. (2) The Government
bought it for £3O and a hogshead of brandy.
(1) In what manner do a pair of 2000-ohm
wireless headphones differ from a 4000-ohm
pair ? (2) Which are the more sensitive ? (3)
Any difference which way they are connected
in the case of a crystal set ? (4) What factors
determine their sensitivity ? —7339.
(1) By the number of turns of wire on the
magnets; the 4000-ohm headphones have more
turns of wire than the 2000-ohm' ’phones. (2)
The 4000-ohm pair. (3) Immaterial in the case
of a crystal set. (4) Number of turns of wire
wound on the magnets; distance between dia-
phragm and armature and dimensions of
diaphragm.
(1) Who founded Melbourne ? (2) In what
circumstances was the site chosen ? —7416.
(1) John Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner.
Batman, in May, 1835, selected the present site
of Melbourne as “the place for a village.”
Fawkner is looked upon as the actual founder-.
His expedition landed at Port Phillip on August
15, 1835, and the claim of members of the ex-
pedition that they had a right to settle
on Batman’s “treaty” land was recognised by
the British Government.
My roses last year were badly affected with
mildew. I have pruned them this year; is
there anything l can do to minimise the trouble ?
—7393.
Spray with lime-and-sulphur (trade strength),
especially on the limbs which are nearest the
ground. Dig around the base of the roses and
add wood ashes to the soil. Further sprayings
can be given when the buds appear, and again
early next year when humid weather arrives.
If the remedies are unsuccessful replace the
roses with mildew-proof kinds, of which there
are plenty on the market.
A corner of my garden is wet, very low-lying
and unsightly. What can I grow in it to
improve it ? —7399.
First put a drainage trench through it to
carry off surplus water: this will sweeten the
soil. Then build on it a rockery, which, when
filled with light loam, will grow any of the
beautiful flowering annuals. If a rockery is un-
suitable, plant arum files, pussy willow and
hibiscus shrubs, cannas, geraniums and pelar-
goniums. Vegetables suitable for the position
are rhubarb, celery and beetroot.
I am a nurse, attending patients in their own
homes. In what circumstances am I (a)
responsible to make an income-tax return, (b)
liable to be assessed for State or Federal
income tax ? In the case of the N.S.W. unem-
ployment tax, should my successive employers
deduct this when paying me, or should I be
assessed on the basis of an income-tax return ?
—7186.
Your various employers should deduct unem-
ployment-relief tax, plus alllowance for board
and lodging (£1 per week). A return is
required for income-tax purposes when the
total income from personal exertion exceeds
£250, or exceeds £2OO from personal exertion
and property, or property only.
What is Beam wireless ? —7284.
A system of directional transmission wherein
the waves are directed from the transmitter to
the distant receiver in the form of a narrow
beam of electro-magnetic energy somewhat
similar to the visual beam from a searchlight.
Receivers located in the path of this beam will
receive the signals with good strength, but
those placed outside of this narrow area will
hear the signals very weakly or not at all. Its
chief applications he in the exchange of mes-
sages between far-distant countries and in radio-
beacons used for guiding ships and aircraft.
What is the Pasteur treatment for procuring
immunity against anthrax, hydrophobia and.
other virulent diseases? —7477.
It consists in the injection of a preparation
containing organisms of the sort that caused
the disease which have had their virulence re-
duced by growth under unfavorable conditions.
These stimulate the blood to produce anti-
toxins.
Addresses of post-primary school-teachers’
organisations in N.S.W., Vic., S. Ails, and
Queensland ? —7250.
Secretaries’ addresses are: N.S.W., F. C.
Wootten, Fort-street Boys’ High School, Syd-
ney; Vic., Mrs. M. Donald, V.C.A. Building,
Collins-place, Melbourne; Q., W. Geraghty,
Box 1146 P, G.P.0., Brisbane; S. A., F. R.
Forgan, Rechabite Chambers, Victoria-square,
Adelaide.
(1) Advantages of the new radio-frequency
“Pentode” Valves over the screen-grid types ?
(2) Can an ordinary screen-grid . valve be re-
placed by a R.F. Pentode in an A.C. receiver ?
(3) Are they suitable for use with an auto-
matic volume control ? —7460.
(1) It provides greater selectivity, more stable
operation over a wide range of plate and
screen-grid voltages; it also provides greater
uniformity of screen-grid current, which makes
it possible to use a series resistor from the high
voltage tap on the power supply for obtaining
the required screen-grid voltage. A larger aerial
may be used, if desired, owing to the elimina-
tion of cross-talk. (2) Yes, subject to minor
circuit alterations. (3) Yes.
What are the Nobel Prizes ? —7469.
There are five of them, founded by the will
of Dr. Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896. They
are each worth about £BOOO and are awarded
each yeas for the most important discovery or
improvement in (1) physics, (2) chemistry, (3)
physiology or medicine, (4) the most distin-
guished literary work of an ideal tendency, and
(5) the best effort towards the promotion of
peace.
(1) Number of unemployed in N.S.W. ? (2)
In what year did unemployment in the State
reach the highest level ? (3) Number in that
year ? —7313.
(1) Can’t say. Such information is collected
only at a census and the details relating to the
census taken in June last are not yet available.
(2) and (3) The Commonwealth Statistician col-
lects returns at quarterly intervals showing the
proportion of unemployed members of trade
unions, for which returns are supplied. The
proportion was at the highest level in June
quarter, 1932, 33.2 p.c.; in June quarter, 1933,
it was 29.6 p.c. These returns, however, cover
only a comparatively small proportion of the
workers of N.S.W.'
(1) Death duties State and Federal on an
estate of £lO,OOO ( land and stock ) in Queens-
land (taxpayer domiciled in Queensland ) ? (2)
How is the value of an estate for probate
arrived at ? (3) Do the beneficiaries (wife and
children of taxpayer ) have to pay full income
tax on the amount they receive ? —7332.
(1) Federal: rate per cent., £1 up to £2OOO and
thereafter an additional percentage of one-fifth
of a pound for every £lOOO or part thereof in ex-
cess of £2OOO. A rebate of one-third is allowed
where the estate passes to a widow, children or
grandchildren. Queensland succession duties on
£lO,OOO, when husband is beneficiary, 7 p.c.,
other relatives 10} p.c., strangers in blood 14
p.c. (2) On official or sworn valuations of the
assets in the estate. (3) Income tax is paid only
on any interest or profits derived from the pro-
perty received.
What is the effect of the following explosives
as compared to gunpowder, picric acid, gun-

(1) What is the “cannon-ball service” in
tennis as used by Vines ? (2) How is it done ?
—7395.
(1) It is a straight very fast service carrying
no spin. The term is a newspaper coinage
(2) The ball is hit with the full face of the
racquet, and naturally must be thrown high
into the air. Tilden worked it out and found
that a service of this kind hit by a 6ft. man,
3ft. above his head, has only 6in. of court for
placement; the net covers the balance.
Have any improvements been made in the
piano, the violin and the ’cello in the last 50
years ? —7289.
As regards the violin, none. Piano methods
of construction have been improved as experi-
ence accumulated, and American-made grands
now possess a third pedal, placed between the
usual two, the effect of Which is to sustain the
tone on all notes that were struck just as the
central pedal was depressed; it permits of
independent action of the dampers on notes
subsequently struck. The Moor “coupled-
octave” feature has been embodied by some
noted pianoforte-manufacturers—notably Bech-
stein —in special models, but is not in much
demand. As to the ’cello, Prof. Karapateff, a
Russo-American dilettante, experimented with
some success with the addition of a fifth (treble
E) string, which vastly increased the available
repertoire of the instrument. As in the case of
the Moor addition to the pianoforte, the fact
that there are no scores available that directly
indicate the use of this resource has been a
handicap upon its general adoption.
How to solder aluminium? —7317.
An alloy containing 60 p.c. tin and 40 p.c.
zinc is most satisfactory for the solder. No
flux is used. Rubbing the surfaces of the alu-
minium under the melted solder with a wire
brush or an old file will clean the surface so
that the solder will take. A method easier for
amateurs is to use aluminium paint as a com-
bined flux and solder.
(1) What are “planetoids”? (2) Diameter in
miles of the Earth, Mercury, Jupiter and Nep-
tune ? —7325.
(1) A numerous group of very small planets
which, with one exception, travel in orbits
lying between those of Mars and Jupiter. The
planetoid Ceres, which is the largest, was dis-
covered in 1801 by Piazzi. Its diameter is
480 miles. (2) 7918, 2770, 86,500 and 34,000
miles respectively.
Surely music has some meaning, despite the
controversialists in The Bulletin a few weeks
ago. What about “Robin Adair” ? Wouldn't
the music suggest the spirit of the words, even
if the words were lost ? —7400.
Scarcely. The melody is of Irish origin; the
familiar Verses were written by Lady Caroline
Keppel, when separated from her lover, Dr.
Robin Adair, of Dublin, whom she subsequently
married. She records that the air to which she
fitted the words was known as “Eileen Aroon.”
Robert Burns, who believed it to be of
Scottish origin, wrote lines for it, and three
or four other poets before him. None of these
efforts conveys the same sentimental meaning as
Lady Caroline’s. Before her time the words
most persistently linked to the air were those
by St. Leger, who conceived the lyric as a
drinking song.
(1) Who were the great Florentine painters,
and who were the Venetians ? (2) What are
the outstanding differences between them ?
7329.
(1) Florentines: Verocchio, Donateilo,
Masaccio, Michelangelo, Paolo Uccello, Andrea
del Castagno, Antonio Pollaiuolo, Botticelli,
Leonardo da Vinci and Simone Martini. Vene-
tians: Giovanni Bellini, Tintoretto, Giorgione,
Titian, Jacopo Bassano, Canaletto and Guardi.
(2) The color of the Florentines was much
gayer than that of the Venetians, but not so
considered and harmonious. Venetian paint-
ing had a great deal more atmosphere. The
Florentines had painted only religious and
mythological subjects when the Venetians
started to paint the everyday lives of the people
of their times and to introduce their domestic
pets. Landscape is practically unknown among
painters of the Florentine school save as a
slight background to their magnificent figures.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
BETTER BEEF BULLS.
“El V.”: The rise in wool prices is
certain to hearten the ram market and
send the bigger buyers scrambling for
the old Riverina bloods within the next
few months, but the sheepmen have no-
thing like the chances of the cattlemen
to improve their stock at a reasonable
price. Some of the choicest beef blood
in the world has been imported in the
last few years, including chunky strains
from popular Scottish-Argentine fami-
lies. Anthony Hordern’s famous Missie
bull, Masterkey, cost 4000 guineas;
Basildon Rosicrucian, the English cham-
pion brought into the country last year,
cost 3000 guineas. Balcairn Count, Col-
lynie King Edward and some other
Shorthorns were secured for over 2000
guineas each, not to mention Herefords
of the Eyton Meddler (English reserve
champion) type which have come into the
country. Their progeny over the last two
or three years has been purchasable for
a song compared with the British prices
of their congeners, even allowing for the
fact that the depression has hit the other
side of the world as well as Australia.
Overseas opinion leans to the belief
that beef prices are coming back with a
bump—hence the new interest in the N.T.
development—and there is an ideal
opportunity for the various State Gov-
ernments interested in improving the beef
trade to help the poor shattered graziers
to improve their herds with some of the
magnificent progeny of the best blood
in the world which can be got cheaply
to-day.
It has always been the same in Aus-
tralia. When the Mortons sold Mt. Der-
rimut in 1867 they had great difficulty
in getting £92 for their star cow, Roan
Summerton, let alone for some of the rest
of the herd. Within five years after-
wards no granddaughter of the old lady
could be bought under 700 guineas and
five sold at auction at an average of over
1500 guineas each. In the ’nineties, again,
“beef cattle were done,” but by the out-
break of the Great War the auction rings
resounded with thousand-guinea bids for
stock whose ancestors a decade and a half
before couldn’t command offers of £25.
It’s no wonder our herds aren’t improved
on an even scale. Neither financial
houses, Governments nor taxation de-
partments seem to recognise the value
of good bulls and females in creating
future income for languishing cattle
properties. And nobody thinks of buy-
ing first-class cattle unless the prices are
in the sky. Hence thousands of scrub
and medium-class sires exist on grazing
farms, on which a little encouragement
and help would place some of the best
meat-producing blood in the world.
DRAUGHTS AND COWS.
“Benign”: “Breaker” (B. 5/7/’33)
advocates the breeding of draught horses.
Encouraged by the high prices of last
year scores of graziers in Queens-
land have purchased draught mares and
stallions, all to compete in this “under-
supplied sideline.” In three years’ time
the demand will have to be very great
indeed to come anywhere near the in-
creased supply. Most farmers will by
then have all the horse-power they need.
“Breaker” also states that horses take
very little looking after. Three years ago
I bought an entire and 12 mares. Of the
latter, to-day I have only seven left,
the other five having died through foaling
too fat.
A few cows will prove a better propo-
sition. They are easier to look after, re-
quire less outlay, give quicker profits
and show fewer losses. Say 10 cows
costing £4O have eight calves a year, which,
when fattened and trucked to Homebush,
net £4 per head (this is being conserva-
tive). At the end of three years the cows
will have netted £96, or 90 per cent, per
annum on your outlay.
Then take 10 mares. If decent at all
they will cost you £lOO at the least, and
you are indeed lucky if they rear seven
foals a year, which you must keep until
three years old. These will net you about
£25 a head at the very most; so at the
end of three years your return will be
£l75 —or 56 per cent, on outlay. When
you send in your next lot of youngsters
to be sold you will probably find a
lighter demand for a heavier supply.
PIG-SELLING COSTS.
“Porcus”: Just another sample of
what the man on the land is up against
Here are the detailed account sales
which I have received from a reputable
agency firm in Melbourne covering the
sale of 22 pigs:
By 2 pigs .. .. ..£0 17 0
9 „ 610 G
1 1 11 0
1 „ 110 0

Yard dues, 4d. per hd... 7 4
Droving and cartage .. 7 4
Feed 7 4
£3 7 0
Net proceeds .. .. .. . £lO G 0
You will notice that the charges
amount to about 25 per cent, of the
gross amount realised at the market.
These were really good pigs, York-Berk
X, in fine condition; they ranged from
prime suckers eight weeks old (6s. 6d.)
to bacon sizes and were fed on apples,
milk and grain. They were bred on the
place and that alone saved them from
being a liability instead of an asset. As
it is they do not nearly pay for the cost
of breeding and feeding, let alone the
value of the feed consumed. The agent’s
charges are the same as when pigs were
booming. The charge for feeding (7s.
4d.) —a normal agent’s charge —is an
outrage.
These particular pigs arrived in the
market about midnight on Tuesday and
were sold at ten o’clock on Wednesday.
The amount charged for feed equals
the price of a bag of pollard (six
bushels = 12d. lb.). As there had been
three consecutive weekly rises in the pig
market reported in the press —before this
lot were consigned—l reckon we were
lucky to get anything for them. Yet if
you want to buy a piece of pork the re-
tailer will ask lOd. a pound or more for
it.
Needless to say pig-breeding cannot
progress under those conditions and my
operations in the future will be limited
to what can be consumed on the farm.
BREEDING CORRIEDALES.
“Marsh”: Corriedales must be care-
fully culled at all stages of breeding.
Once having been bred, they will stand
true to type.
By mating a Lincoln ram whose wool
is of a 40’s spinning quality with a
merino ewe of a 60’s count, the progeny
will result in a half-bred or a first cross
with wool of a 50’s count. Select the
best of these half-bred ewes (50’s) and
mate them with merino rams (60’s). The
result will be a quarter-bred (54-56’s
quality). To these quarter-bred ewes join
merino rams (60’s). The comeback (56’s)
will result. For the final cross mate come-
back ewes (56’s) with merino rams (60’s),
thus bringing about the Corriedale, whose
wool will be of a 58’s quality.
In cold climates the wool of a Corrie-
dale is apt to grow stronger in quality.
In extreme heat it will become finer.
There are some districts in N. S. Wales
and Queensland where Corriedales would
prove a better proposition than merinos.
COUNTING SHEEP.
“Jumbuck”: I don’t want to try “Ven-
ture’s” sheep-counting method again (B.
19/7/’33). 1 tried it years ago. 1 suggest
he should count in “threes.” I have
counted through some big mobs in my
time, one in particular of 22,000 lively
wethers. They were counted in threes,
with the odd one for the hundred. I
won’t have “Venture’s” checking of the
tallyman’s score of the hundreds, by
means of the finger. Pay attention to
counting and, if the tallyman can’t keep
those hundreds without making a mis-
take, sack him.
CROSSBRED EWES.
“Granova”: When wool prices first
dropped many N.S.W. wheat-belt graziers
changed over from merinos to crossbred
ewes. Drought arrived, and the cross-
bred ewes came out on top. Recently.
I saw a flock of 1000 merino ewes with
only two lambs left. They had been
hand-fed on chaff and molasses, but
dried up completely, leaving the lambs to
die a miserable death. There are dozens
of cases in Reefton (N.S.W.) district of
merino ewes losing from 50 to 90 per
cent, of their lambs. The crossbred ewes
have proved much better mothers, and
are able to produce milk under drought
conditions. Losses of their lambs have
been slight and most owners will be able
to get a percentage away as fat suckers.
THE COMPOST HEAP.
“Bismark”: The compost heap or pit
is of value to the farm, as it utilises
all sorts of easy-rotting refuse and is
rich in organic matter. Whether you
decide on a heap or pit, the bottom
should be cemented or drained so that
the liquid escaping from the mass can
be returned to the heap. Alternate layers
of earth, refuse and lime are made until
the heap is about 4ft. high. The heap
should be kept moist —make a hole into
the interior and pour the water in. Slops
from the kitchen will be found best.
Have the top layer of earth. The heap
will take a few months to mature. It
should then be well forked and another
layer of lime and, finally, earth should
be added. In another month it will be
fit for use.
FLOOD DANGER.
“Noah”: Changing water channels
have subjected much of my land to flood-
ing, banks being needed to save crops.
The best way, I find, is to erect a bank
of tin or old railway sleepers to the
height required and build up against it,
throwing back about five or six feet. I
leave this till the whole bank settles down
after rain or flood and then take the
framework away and build up the other
side with the sloped approach. The
eased-up bank stands better than the up-
right one, and does not tend to form
currents or scour out. Much of the work
can be done with the plough and scoop,
and the after-care is merely shovel work.
Patch any breaks immediately and get
a grass coating as early as possible. Pro-
tective methods of this kind have turned
otherwise lost lands to good purpose.
ORANGE AND MANDARIN PRICES.
“Johnno”: Queensland citrus-fruit
growers are wondering if the bottom
has fallen out of the industry, or if re-
munerative prices of a few years ago will
return. Those of long experience are
optimistic, as depression is invariably
followed by a corresponding period of
prosperity. Orange- and mandarin-
growers have been hit through over-pro-
duction. The average net returns per
bushel-case of a Queensland grower for
seven years were:
Oranges. Mandarins.
1926 .... 7s. 7d. 12s. sd.
1927 .... 9s. l|d. 14s. ljd.
1928 .... 3s. 3 3-16 d. 9s. Oid.
1929 .... 6s. lid. 13s. 3id.
1930 .... 4s. 3Jd. ss. 3Jd.
1931 .... 3s. sid. 4s. B*d.
1932 .... 2s. sd. 2s. B*d.
To obtain the above averages during
the last three years the grower had
to sacrifice about half his crop, which
fell to the ground to rot. Had labor
been employed and the entire crop
marketed, as in good years, there would
have been no profit, and perhaps debt
at the end of the season. Owing to a
smaller Queensland crop this year,
growers will probably show a higher
average return per case than last year,
although there may not be much differ-
ence in the net earnings.
TURKEYS ARE PROFITABLE.
“Jack Point”: Turkey-hatching should
be done so that the birds will mature when
the demand is good enough to ensure a
fair return. Young turkeys are the big-
gest eaters alive, with the possible excep-
tion of ducklings, so food must be plenti-
ful.
A good commercial chick mixture
mixed to a crumbly consistency with sour
milk is recommended for a start, with
lettuce, if possible, as green feed, and
shell-grit after the second week. Sour
milk and water should always be avail-
able, and the receptacles used for feed :
ing cleaned often. No special housing
is necessary after the first few weeks, but
a clean range and isolation from fowls
are absolutely essential.
Make perches in steps. If all are on
the same level the birds wilt fight. Grain,
either oats or wheat, should be given
after eight weeks, the change-over to
maize being made gradually a couple of
months before marketing. The birds are
great foragers, and will garner enough
insects and grubs to keep them if they
are given a little sour milk and grain.
Turkeys can be raised in confine-
ment, but will then need more feed,
particularly of a protein-rich nature.
Boiled bunny is a decidedly helpful ad-
junct. Lucerne is a useful constituent in
their diet. The droppings are rich fer-
tiliser, and will keep the lucerne patch
growing.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
I mixed molasses with salt to give to
sheep—two gallons molasses and two of
water to a bag of salt. Is molasses mixed
with water and put in salt harmful to
stock? —7144.
Salt should not be given to stock in a
saline solution —that is to say, dissolved
in water. There is always a great danger
that salt poisoning may occur, particu-
larly if fresh water is not supplied in
abundance. Molasses may be given
mixed in water, but is only of use as an
appetiser and mild digestive stimulant
when coarse, dry fodders and grasses are
being fed. Molasses mixed with salt as
a lick serves no useful purpose, and it
would be far preferable to provide salt
in a separate container and to supply the
molasses along with the foodstuffs if it
is so desired. To provide salt as a solu-
tion with molasses and water is not
advised. Bonemeal could be given with
advantage in a separate trough or con-
tainer, mixed with a little salt.

drafting-yards and their arrangement with
shearing-shed and dip may be had from
the department for 2s. 6d.
My sin-year-old horse has a gall (which
seems to be getting harder) on the inside
of the hock of each hind leg, and a girth
gall as large as a pigeon’s egg (also hard).
Method of treatment ? —7 111.
Long-standing hard growths need
surgical cutting out, whereas others yield
to treatment with hot-water bathing and
the application of copper sulphate or
bluestone crystals. If the growths are
hard and painless and do not contain pus
it is advisable, not to try to remove them,
but to protect the surrounding parts by
relieving any pressure due to a bad-fitting
saddle, etc. If, again, the hock galls are
due to hoof-striking, it might be found
advisable to bandage the affected areas.
Growths that contain pus should be
treated with hot foments, and offending
material squeezed out when softening of
the parts has occurred. Tincture of
iodine should be applied when the pus
has been removed and the wound cleaned
thoroughly.
Is feeding milk to cows and pigs advis-
able ?— 6797.
It is not recommended that whole milk
be fed either to adult cows or adult pigs.
It is both uneconomical and unsound.
Milk, however, is a unique nutritive food,
and, in so far as the animal given milk is
well nourished, it aids milk production.
Where can I obtain a small machine
for threshing lucerne, and price? —7l67.
From T. Robinson and Co., Burwood,
Sydney; price £139. For lucerne and
other small seeds a special screen costing
£4 ss. is necessary.
(1) Can oranges be successfully grown
in the far north of M.L. ? (2) Price of
land per acre in suitable district ? (3)
Is there much demand for property in the
citrus districts ? (4) How do living costs
compare with those in N.S.W. ? (5) What
is the total M.L. taxation on an invest-
ment income of £295 ?—6764.
(1) It is claimed they can be success-
fully grown in the North Auckland and
Bay of Plenty districts. They have not
been planted extensively in the past, as
good supplies of Cook Island oranges
are available, but there is a demand for
good-keeping late fruit, and an increased
acreage is being planted. (2) Most of
the country is cleared. An approximate
price is £3O per acre for suitable land,
with higher values near the larger towns.
(3) Fair demand. (4) Food is rather
cheaper, but clothing and house rent are
a little dearer. (5) There is no taxation
on an investment income of £295 per
annum from such a property if the un-
improved value of the land is under
£3OOO. If it is over that value the tax
for a married man, without family, re-
siding on and working the property,
would be £1 14s. lOd. The tax in the
case of an absentee who signed the
cheques, etc., would be £ll 3s. Bd., or, in
the case of a speculative investment,
£l4 18s. 2d.
I wish to give bananas and cotton a
trial on a small scale at Elmore (Vic.).
Can you furnish particulars as to plant-
ing and cultivation ? —-7012.
Better not try either. Banana plants
require hot and humid conditions
with a rainfall of some 70 to 80 inches,
or even higher, and a deep, well-drained
soil containing an abundance of humus ;
such conditions exist in some parts of
the North Coast area of N. S. Wales—
Tweed Heads, for instance —and parts of
the Queensland coast. Conditions for
cotton-growing are also unsuitable at
Elmore. Suggest that you write to the
Department of Agriculture, Brisbane,
for pamphlets dealing with these two sub-
jects.
What climatic and soil conditions are
required to grow Brazil, Barcelona, fil-
bert, cob and hazel nuts, and the vari-
ous Chinese nuts? Are any of these
grown in N.S.W. at present? —7104.
The Barcelona nut is a tropical fruit
and it is not considered that it would be
satisfactory in N.S.W. For the Brazil, a
light loam with a dry subsoil is suitable.
It grows under a far range of temperate
climate. This nut it not grown to any
extent in N. S. Wales. The same re-
marks apply to filbert, cob and hazel
nuts. Chinese nuts are not grown com-
mercially in N. S. Wales.
(1) What prospects are there for a
youth of 20 with an agricultural degree
who wants a job? (2) Is it compul-
sory for a prospective student to have 12
months’ practical experience before
entering the University ? If so, would
the Hawkesbury Agricultural College
take him for this period? —7o74.
(1) It is difficult at present to get
one in his profession. Men with de-
grees in agricultural science are princi-
pally employed by the Government, but
appointments are rarely made. A few
obtain positions with private firms.
(2) Information obtainable from the
Registrar of the Sydney University. (3)
Only courses available at Hawkesbury
are the Diploma in Agriculture, covering
a period of three years, and the Diploma
in Dairying, covering a period of two
years.
Information regarding the growing,
drying and marketing in Sydney of herbs,
i.e., sage and thyme ? —7427.
Wholesale grocers give little encour-
agement. They trade with overseas
firms and are diffident about buy-
ing locally for fear the quality would
not be uniform. Imports into N. S.
Wales for 1931-32 amounted 51,4611 b. of
all varieties of herbs (not medicinal), the
value being £653. When divided amongst
all the wholesale grocers the amount of
any particular variety would not be very
large. Leaflet on cultivation of herbs
has been forwarded.
(1) Any way of treating rabbit so as to
make the bone edible in the same way as
canned fish? (2) What equipment would
be required for canning rabbits ? (3)
What regulations would have to be com-
plied with if run by two private persons
and their sons in Vic.? —6B72.
(1) There is no known method by
which the bones of rabbits, during pro-
cessing, may be softened as in the case
of fish. (2) With canning conducted on
a small scale the equipment, which would
include boning tables, pickling tubs (if
rabbits are to be lightly salted), scalds,
can-filling machinery, vacuum-closer, can-
washing appliances, retorts, provision
for steam and power, etc., would cost at
least £lOOO. (3) The secretary of the
shire or municipality in which you re-
side can give you full information. And
consult Vic. Dept, of Agriculture on the
general subject of rabbit-canning.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Westerner”: Swarming in millions, the
red mite, a curse to W.A. growers, sucks
the sap from seedlings and destroys 25
per cent, or sometimes all of a planting.
The best remedy is to sprinkle the fallow
liberally with half-slaked lime. This
burns up the eggs, which lie on or just
under the surface.
“Sheep o”: Tell “Granova” (B.
19/7/’33) it’s a risky business feeding
wheat to sheep, unless there’s an addi-
tional fodder available as ballast. Sheep
will digest dry wheat, but it should be fed
to them in country where edible scrub
can be found. Impaction follows with
a wheat ration only; deaths come soon
afterwards.
“Mulgo”: To make a good footbridge
across a creek with No. 8 fencing-wire,
twist three strands together for strength
and run three of the twisted wires from
bank to bank. Strain to the bottoms of
strong posts. Then lay boards across for
decking, fastening the ends with No. 10
wire through bored holes. Run a couple
of single wires across on each side from
the top and middle of posts, for guards.
This bridge lasts for many years.
“Jumbuck”: In small sheds extra-good
fleeces are sometimes put aside and then
placed in the press so that they will be
on top of the bale when it is opened up.
Buyers learnt this dodge years ago and
it merely injures the grower who prac-
tises it. The top portions of all bales are
not opened up and shown; some are
shown bottoms up. It’s better to keep
out the small percentage of extra-good
fleeces even if the line is a star lot.
“Gumblegubbin”: The giant sunflower
seed, which grows anywhere, is good food
for poultry. It need not be shelled. The
fowls will pick off the seed themselves.
“Yarri”: Half of a small hollow log,
with the top covered, and slots cut along
the sides, makes a good fowl feeder. It
prevents mash or other soft foods from
being trampled.
“Chooky”: Chicks sweated from over-
heating are prone to disease, so as night
comes on, say at 4 p.m., turn the brooder
lamps high. Ease them off at dusk.
Later the lamps can go very low, as the
chicks generate a great deal of their own
heat. Raise the flame in the morning, as
the air is cooler and the chicks run in
and out, easing off the heat under the
covers.
“Billy See”: You can bore a hole
through metal easily with a carpenter’s
brace, a drill, a plank and four three-
inch nails. Get alongside a weather-
board wall where the lap of the boards
will give just the height at which the
plank needs to be adjusted. Get back
a foot or two from one end of the plank,
mark out the cap of the brace and drive
in the nails so that they will enclose the
cap and keep it from wobbling and wan-
dering. Drill on a firm foundation ; take
a purchase with the heel of the plank
under a weatherboard, slip brace and drill
into position and apply pressure. It takes
two to do the job, the driller and another
to manipulate the plank. With a nice
even pressure, given by the plank, a hole
can be quickly pushed through the most
stubborn metal

Wool Prospects
One remarkable feature of the depres-
sion is that it has not left the world with
a wool surplus. Low prices have helped
disposal. They have come down to a
level which allows wool competition with
artificial silk. So last year’s exports from
Australia were 280,771 bales better than
the year before, and the carry-over at
the end of the 1932-33 season was
110,000 bales less than the previous year
—a mere 35,428 bales total, which
would astonish pre-war and pool-year
buyers by its smallness. At present, with
the new season beginning, there is no
wool except skin wool to be had in Aus-
tralia, and all over the world consump-
tion seems to have caught right up to
supply, despite decline in French needs.
Still, even French tops stocks are said to
be much lower than they were at the
end of 1931-32.
* * * *
At the end of July, 90,131 bales of the
1933-34 crop were in store in Australia.
London sales, pending the opening of
the Australian season on August 28,
seem to indicate what may be expected
on a market with better-class lines re-
stricted because of the drought, and with
a large proportion of fleeces so unduly
light as to make it certain (remember-
ing the narrowed carry-over) that 15 per
cent, less wool in quantity than last year
will be available at auction. On the find-
ings of the recent conference of growers
and brokers, it seems certain that the
total restriction will approach half a mil-
lion bales.
* * * *
Merino wools, of course, will be
most affected. Fleeces are lighter and
much of the wool is dry, carries dust and
shows hunger fineness. The recent solid
rise was largely due to U.S.A. specu-
lators who were laying in commodity
stocks against the threatened revaluation
of the dollar. Goldsbrough Mort place
the U.S.A. price improvement from
March to May at 40 per cent, to 70 per
cent. So soon as that speculation sub-
sided, the market quietened. At the
same time, it seems inevitable that
soon American buying must become
a stronger influence in the higher-class
markets. Last year Sydney sent only
13,084 bales across the Pacific against
the pre-depression export minimum of
24,000 bales. The prime factor, how-
ever, in view of the nature of this year’s
wool, will be the Continental and Japan-
ese markets. The percentages which vari-
ous important buying centres took in the
last three seasons were as follows:
1930-31. 1931-32. 1932-33.
United Kingdom .; 27 p.c. 32 p.c. 27 p.e.
Japan 18 „ 20 „ 18 „
France.. . . . . 18 „ 14 „ 15
Germany and Austria 15 „ 10 ~ 14 „
Rest of Europe .. 13 „ 14 „ 16 „
U.S.A. .. 3 ~ 1 ~ 1 „
Local 6 „ 9 „ 9 „
100 p.c. 100 p.c. 100 p.c.
With the decreased output this season
the proportion which the Continent and
Japan may be expected to take will be
larger than last year, there being no
indication that their buying will fall off,
while since the market supply will run
more largely than usual to fine wools,
competition for the residue should be
stimulated by supply restriction. The
statistical position is very strong, as most
brokers emphasise in their current re-
ports, in view particularly of a certain
seasonal world shortage.
* * * *
Since the July London sale there has
been a weakening of the oversea markets,
and the market has settled down to
quietness and caution while the buyers
gird on their armor for the outburst of
buying which will take place when the
new season’s wool comes on sale at the
end of this month. Only in crossbreds
is there any activity. Machinery at Brad-
ford is busy, but the tops market now has
a weaker tendency, though it shows a
distinct improvement over the London
sale period prices and a big rise averag-
ing more than 33i per cent, over the
prices at the end of June 1932:
BRADFORD TOPS.

Fine 70s .. 194 d. 31d. 32d.
Fine 64’ s .. 204 d. 29*d. 293 d.

Medium 50’s. . lOd. 15d. 14gd.
All 46’s and 40’s are Id. down against the previous
week.
The general per bale average at the
end of 1932-33 in Australia, moreover,
was much better than the year’s aver-
age of £ll 9s. Id., which in turn was a
distinct improvement on £lO 18s. 3d. for
1931-32 and £ll 2s. Bd. for the year be-
fore that. Therefore, it does not seem an
idle hope that another 15 per cent, to
20 per cent, will be added to prices
at the new series of Australian sales
—wool has been shorn so early and
deliveries are so far forward already that
full seasonal catalogues should be avail-
able when the first auction of 99,064
bales takes place on August 28. That
sale and the quick succession opening
sales in other States —Adelaide, Sept. 8 ;
Brisbane, Sept. 11 ; Melbourne and Perth,
Sept. 18, with Sydney reopening on the
same day with double the previous cata-
logue —will be of crucial importance to
graziers. 582,000 bales are scheduled for
sale in Sydney before the new year and
504,500 afterwards, exclusive of the June
clearing sale; and in Brisbane 190,000
bales are to be offered before January 1
and 180,000 afterwards. The bulk of the
decline in supply has been in the two
north-eastern States.
Make Wool-growing Payable
The intriguing query in the situation
now is not whether wool prices are going
to rise, which they are, but whether they
are going to rise to a level which will make
the business payable. The report of the
Queensland Land Board states that in
the best Central Queensland leases “with
wool at Is. per pound, it takes 4000
sheep to pay expenses.” It will therefore
take an average rise of 3.14 d. per pound
over last season’s prices to put the 4000-
sheep-and-under men on a bare solvency
basis. About 77 per cent, of Queensland
sheepowners have 5000 sheep or less.
For the freehold men in the more highly
taxed State of N. S. Wales the position
must be worse. The situation seems to
call on all Governments to make a
special effort to relieve the burdens of
the men whose commodity is our staple
in times of stress.
* * * *
Furthermore, organisation might en-
courage and help them to improve their
flocks while rams are cheap—the N. S.
Wales ram sale scheme is only fiddling
with the business. Any aid which Gov-
ernments can give in the next year or
two to increase the production of sound
wool and to reduce the financial burdens
of the harassed graziers will repay itself
in increased taxation later on.
Those Bale Weights
“Sheepo”: “Murrawong” refuses to
accept my statement (B. 12/7/’33) that
the weights marked on the bales are of
assistance to buyers in estimating yields.
I still remember the words used by my
boss (a buyer from Bradford) years
ago, when I was an apprentice at the
wool business. “Remember, the heavier
the condition of the wool, the lighter
the yield ; heavy bales of fleece are heavy
in condition.” He always looked at the
bale weights, and in cases where a bale
happened to be a bit heavier than its
mates in the same lot, there’d be a little
bit of extra rooting down into the wool
of that bale to find out why.
* * * *
There certainly is a limit to the
amount of fleece wool that can be put
into a bale, but as should be obvious to
“Murrawong” and anyone else, 40 fleeces
of light-conditioned wool will weigh less
than 40 of heavy condition, thus making
it apparent that a bale containing the
latter must yield less clean scoured wool
than one containing the former. You
cannot get the same number of light-
conditioned fleeces into a bale as you
can of those heavy in condition.
Meat Export and the Quota
If Australia does not look to her
laurels, she will again lose her chance
in the world’s meat markets when oppor-
tunities are brightest. Between 1922 and
1924 the Commonwealth Government
and three of the States passed legislation,
modelled on the plans of the Indian and
Ceylon teagrowers, which provided for
statutory self-control of export by the
industry, with official grading assistance,
and the establishment of a marketing
organisation in London financed by a
levy on beef and mutton producers. The
projected control body was named the
Australian Meat Council. The scheme
was subject to the endorsement of inter-
ested growers through a referendum. It
faced opposition in Victoria from pro-
ducers’ bodies and everywhere from
meatworks owners, and was defeated.
* * * *
The Commonwealth Meat Council
now in process of formation has several
main features of the old A.M.C., and it
is meeting with the same brands of oppo-
sition—the grower who will not learn
his lesson from the dairymen and the
fruit men. The Exporters’ Association
has strongly urged the Commonwealth
Government to convene a conference to
discuss measures to enforce grading
standards, to regulate meat shipment,
to supervise and lay down regulations
for meat marketing and generally to do
everything needful to build up and ex-
pand the meat-export trade.
* * * *
Why this should be necessary before
the formation of the council is not clear.
The most urgent • thing is to get the
national plan working and steps taken
towards standardising meat to London
requirements before general prosperity
sets in again and the price of stud stock
rises to normal levels. Every stud bull
put into use which is calculated to im-
prove Australian meat towards the world
standard of early maturity and Smithfield
prime quality is a step towards placing
the Australian meat industry where it
should be—in the forefront of our staple
earning sources.
i'R * *
In Maoriland the Meat Producers’
Board has been operating since 1922 —
it was formed at the time when the Aus-
tralian Meat Council was first mooted.
It consists of five farmer members, two
Government nominees and a stock-and-
station agent. It grades all meat,
arranges all freight contracts, does all
advertising in the U.K. It keeps up a
liaison with railways and shipping cos.
in regard to handling. London charges,
port charges and Smithfield sales are
arranged through it. It regulates ship-
ment quotas. according to the market
and maintains a uniform grade rigidly,
thus making purchases on grade samples
reliable.
* * * *
The Commonwealth adopted the quota
system in April, 1933, and arranged to
work under Argentine conditions on a
weight instead of a carcass basis. It has
agreed to the principle of producer con-
trol, roughly along lines similar to those
in vogue in M.L., while making it clear
that the ultimate decision to form such
an organisation should be left to the
graziers themselves.
* * * *
As the producer is the real meait manu-
facturer and world requirements can only
be satisfied by bringing him into direct
contact with his market, nothing must be
done which will prevent his having his
fate in his own hands. Meat exporters
have had their try at the job. The results,
so far, have not been spectacular. The re-
sponsibility should now be thrown on
the grower of seeing that the
166,588,5001 b. of mutton and the
140,960,4921 b. of frozen beef and veal
which are fixed as Australia’s proportion
of London supply are of a quality
and in such condition as will stand up
to Argentine and M.L. competition.
The Coming Wheat Season
Australia has more interest in wheat
export than any country with an equal
size of crop because her domestic con-
sumption is relatively small. Therefore,
it is good news that there will be much
less wheat from America than for some
years if estimates are accurate. The
carry-over on August lof U.S.A. stocks
is placed at 350,000,000 bushels; but
spring and winter wheat together will
total only 500,000,000 bushels, which is
abnormally small, and by August 1 next
year the surplus hold-over should be cut
down to 200,000,000 bushels. In Canada
operators are estimating the Dominion
crop down to 300,000,000 bushels
(against last year’s 420,000,000 bushels)
and even good rains would not bring the
crop to normal average level:
* * * *
All this is to Australia’s benefit, more
especially as high internal prices are at
present and will for some time militate
against American export. European
crops, including Russian, are said to be
excellent. Outside the U.S.S.R., on the
Western Continent 193,000,000 quarters
should be harvested. In Australia, where
local shippers have been paying the
equivalent of 3s. 6d. f.o.b. per bushel
through July and early August, the sea-
sonal exports of wheat and flour together
from December 1 to August 3 have
totalled 124,859,989 bushels in wheat
terms, of which more than half has gone
from N. S. Wales and W.A. Half of
the total went to the Orient. In eleva-
tors in N. S. Wales on August 10 were
18,109,000 bushels, as compared with
8,492,000 bushels 12 months ago. With
a restricted acreage and smaller crops
due to dry weather, Australia should
have a better time than last season in
the world’s wheat markets in 1933-34.
* * * *
The problems of wheat-growers at pre-
sent are mainly those of procedure. In
every State affected the question of pool
marketing is being discussed, and while
admiration has been expressed in Vic-
torian conferences lately for the N. S.
Wales method of handling the crop, the
Farmers and Settlers’ Association in N.
S. Wales has plumped for a Federal com-
pulsory pool—though the association
does not necessarily represent the con-
certed opinion of the whole of the wheat-
growers of the State. The pool policy
was not established, however, without
some misgiving. Some debaters talked
of socialisation and others harked an
ear back to the surplus-creating habits
of older wool and wheat pools ; but A.
K. Trethowan turned the scale with his
advocacy of the new plan when he said
that if it had not been for the Canadian
pool (which did not hold a bushel of
wheat that it could sell) prices would
have fallen much lower than they actu-
ally had fallen. Bussau, M.L.A., of Vic-
toria, also had a word to say and only
eight hands went up against the scheme.
Denmark v. Australia
“Marin”: Queensland has definitely
set its face against a proposal to limit
the exports of butter and meat, which,
the Queensland Government suggests, has
been under discussion between the Im-
perial authorities and the Commonwealth,
though both Lyons and the British
authorities have denied it. But what I
want to know is: What is our 10 per
cent. Ottawa preference worth to us?
The justification for it was that little
Denmark used to sell Britain half her
dairy and pig products in terms of
money. In 1930 we got £6,000,000 for
our butter sent to London, and Denmark
got £17,000,000 for hers, while other
foreign countries (including Russia,
which had a clear £1,000,000 for its pro-
duct) split up over seven millions. In
the same year our cheese offering sold in
the Old Dart for £174,000, other countries
dividing the rest of £12,500,000 with M.L.
Now, despite Ottawa, 1 see that the latest
weekly figures, which are typical of
many weeks, show Australia’s butter
landing in the Thames at 722 tons, M.L.’s
at 2075 tons and foreign imports at 4000
tons ; and the doubly-galling part of it
is that in spite of the kangaroos we paint
on boxes and the continual boosting
which goes on from Australia House,
the maximum price of our choicest line
is quoted as Is. below that for M.L. and
Argentine butter and 14s. below the
Danish price. It’s no use making ex-
cuses about a situation like that. Ten
per cent, doesn’t help it very much.
“XT”: Wanganella (Austin) has ob-
tained some ram prices which would be
hard to beat. It holds a world’s record
for its sale of the five-year-old “9.1”
to Roy McCaughey for 5000 guineas.
His 30 sons were disposed of for a total
of £lB,OO0 —the best of them for 3050
guineas. They have sold one other sire for
3000 guineas, one for 2900 guineas and 13
between 1000 guineas and 1600 guineas
each, 17 head averaging £1865 ss. lOd.
Even these days, with wool down as it
is, the co. recently refused 2500 guineas
for a six-year-old son of their record-
breaker. No wonder that the stud —
which was founded in 1861 —uses the
letters PEP as a brand!


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The task of winning the Grand
National and the Australian Steeplechase
in the same year has been accomplished
by Redditch, as it was in other years by
Game, Redleap, Daimio, Beilis and
Grafnax. Though handicapper Griffiths
had lifted the Red Dennis gelding 101 b.
to 12st. 1'31b., the field at Caulfield was
so lamentably weak that punters eagerly
accepted the 10 to 9 which McShortodds.
in a moment of recklessness, offered
against Fred Hoysted’s candidate. The
ss. tote div. was at the rate of 10 to 9 on,
but Redditch paid nearly as much as
Mosstrooper for a place, return for each
ss. being 7s. 6d.
Redditch could have equalled (he
achievement of Grafnax in leading all
the way. Bob Inkson rode a waiting race
until the last circuit of the course was
entered upon, when he allowed the hard-
pulling favorite to go to the front. Hynes,
the Sydney jockey, handled Mosstrooper
splendidly, but the veteran ’chaser was
outclassed. Redditch jumped out at the
second-last fence, and this enabled Moss-
trooper to get within a length of him ;
but as soon as Redditch was straightened
he assumed a commanding lead, and
simply romped home. The miles was
covered in 6inin. 54fsec., which is 4{sec.
faster than the previous record, estab-
lished by Bang Bang 12 months ago.
Supremacy of Victorian jumpers was
never more apparent than at present.
Lady Doris had only 9st. 7Tb. in the
Bert'. "Putting, anything on this

Arkaringa Hurdle, but could not gain a
place. Pispoia King, who captured the
Great Eastern Steeplechase last Easter,
was weighted at 9st. 81b. in the Knows-
ley Steeplechase, and fell. So did Prince
Flaviol, whose rider Stubbs died that
night in the Alfred Hospital.
From a galloping point of view the
outstanding feature at Caulfield was the
success of Wheriko in the second divi-
sion of the Chatsworth Plate for three-
year-olds. This beautifully-modelled
brown colt was bought as a yearling in
M.L. by Telford for 450gns.; Telford
passed the youngster on to E. A. Con-
nolly. Wheriko is by the sire of Phar
Lap and is closely related to Blixten. The
colt has had only three public outings.
Backed from 10 to 1 down to 5 to 1, he
led all the way, and, though by no means
wound up, never looked like being beaten.
Wheriko is in the A.J.C. Derby and the
Victoria Derby, but the only spring han-
dicap for which he was entered is the
Melbourne Cup ; J. H. Davis took no
risks and allotted him 7st. He is a cham-
pion in the making.
Waltzing Lily was withdrawn from the
Balaclava Stakes, and Spearman was
made a pronounced favorite. He was
never dangerous. High Brae (10 to 1),
from Holt’s stable’, won rather unexpect-
edly. Apprentice Heather claimed 71b.
allowance, and with this advantage Mrs.
L. R. Buxton’s neddy managed to defeat
the fast-finishing Heroic Prince by half
a length, with game little Segati a similar
distance off third. Holt and his fol-
lowers went nap on Gallantic in the St.
Aubin Welter, but she let them down
again. The winner, Astronomy, is a
four-year-old son of Windbag, and may
have to be reckoned with in the Cups.
* * - * *
Balgay has only 6st. 71b. in the Metrop.
and if he can retain his present condition
he will take no end of beating. The half-
brother to Lilypond and Tangible made
hacks of the opposition in the Rosehill
Handicap on Saturday. He went to the
front seven furlongs from home, and was
doing his best work at the finish of the
10 furlongs. Pastoralist J. J. Leahy was
able to get 9 to 2 at flag-fall, due to the
heavy support for Cherbourg. The latter
met with interference in the early stages
and returned to the weighing yard rather
dicky in the forelegs. But with the best
of runs he could not have beaten Balgay.
J. T. Jamieson is having a fine run of
success with Persian and Koda Pen. The
latter did not fulfil his engagement at
Rosehill, but his, stablemate (9 to 4) made
no mistake in the Parramatta Mile ; he
practically led all the way, and the result
was not in doubt from the half-mile. He
carried 9st. lib., but drops to 7st. 71b. in
the Epsom. Milantheon, reckoned the
good thing of the day, had every chance
and failed where he was expected to
shine. However, staying is his forte, and
he cannot be discarded for the Metrop.
until he lets his party down over a bit
of a journey.
The boom has gone off Sir Duninald.
His two recent defeats have caused him
to ease considerably in the quotes for the
Epsom, in which race he has been
coupled with most of the fancied candi-
dates in the Metrop. At Rosehill the
washy chestnut had every chance in the
Dundas Handicap, but the best he could
do was to run fifth to Orpah, who started
at tens. Sir Duninald can perhaps be
improved. He is rather low-set and thick,
and has an enormous barrel, which makes
him look above himself.
“Joseph Harlow,” who is well known
in the boot trade, won a double with
Orpah and Havilah Belle (7 to 1). Both
are trained by ex-jockey C. Ryan, who
was recently granted a license to prepare
his team at Randwick. Orpah was
opposed to a strong lot of sprinters in the
Dundas Handicap. Bartle was very
patient with her at the barrier, giving
her a long rein, and wisely keeping her
facing the machine. She got away well
from near the rails and beat the pace-
makers, Erbie and King Pin, in good
style. But Havilah Belle was rather lucky
to win, as Moallin’s stablemate, Silver
Song, was left at the barrier and was last
for the first five furlongs.
The conditions of the Rosehill Went-
worthville Stakps gave the Victorian-
owned and -trained Multudo an advan-
tage. However, he found the Queens-
lander Polly Speck (6 to 1) too good, and
despite Jim Pike’s energy in the last two
furlongs Multudo was beaten by half a
length. Pennyhunter, who has been
spoken of as an Epsom fancy, was a poor
third, tiring badly in the last furlong. Polly
Speck is in the Epsom with 7st. 101 b.
Junee sportsman J. S. Taylor has been
trying to win a race with Grecian Knight
for the past two years. The son of Crow-
dennis just struggled home in the first
division of the Rosehill Maiden after
starting at fives. The runner-up, Lana-
cian, met with bad luck in running, and
should soon enter the winning list. He
is raced by Frank Spurway, who once
had that good galloper Soorak.

The annual report of the A.J.C. shows
an improvement on last year, a deficit of
£6347 having been converted into a sur-
plus of £1931. There was a further reduc-
tion in stakes, prize-money from all
sources # being £87,574 against £108,079
in 1931-32. Increases have been made
for the principal events at the spring
meeting, however, amounting in all to
£3700. The tote turnover also showed a
falling off. At Randwick £580,316 went
through and at Warwick Farm £62,115,
or £642,432 for 20 days at Randwick
and nine at Warwick Farm. The year
before the total was £824,123 for 30 days’
racing at the two courses. Government’s
cut of the tote revenue was £57,819. It
might have got more had it been less
greedy.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Ambrose Palmer, who has been play-
ing football for Footscray in Melbourne
this season, returned to his trade when
Brisbane came to light with offers of
good money for two fights, both of
which he won —he stopped Ron Richards
in eight rounds. Bill Lang combined
football with boxing in Westralia when
he fought in the novice class, but soon
abandoned inflated leather for the padded
sort. He found he could not mix them
without getting muscle-bound.

People who walked to Leichhardt
Stadium on Saturday night—and they
mostly did—were greeted with the news
that Lurich’s “luxurious car” had stalled,
and that he could not get back from Bris-
bane in time to meet Muir. Penchiff took
his place, and for once more wrestling than
buffoonery was seen. Muir (14st. 4|lb.)
was a pound heavier than Penchiff, and
there did not seem 16 ounces of differ-
ence in their skill before Penchiff
pinned his opponent with a short-arm
scissors hold in the fourth. Muir wrestled
like a champion in the fifth, but did not
break even till the sixth, when his stand-
ing over-arm headlocks and press put
Penchiff out of commission. Penchiff
could not carry on, but that was held
not to matter. Another draw.
Footbrawl
The Australian football carnival, which
wound up at Sydney Cricket Ground on
Saturday, proved a financial failure, the
debit on the 10 days’ gathering being
£lOOO. However, many of the Sydney
public received an education in the in-
tricacies of an excellent game and, even
in cases where they came to scoff, re-
mained to admire.
The midweek matches provided some
sterling football, that between Westralia
and South Australia ending in a win for
the latter by 13-18 (96) to 12-11 (83) after
a neck-and-neck struggle. On the same
day, Victoria (20-12) had an easy win
from Tasmania (8-13). N.S.W. then
proceeded to acquire the minor premier-
ship of the meeting by beating Tasmania
20-12 to 15-17. Queensland wished the
wooden spoon on to Canberra, winning
20-16 to 14-10.
Victoria, opposing South Australia in
the final on Saturday, bolted in the first
quarter, piling on 8 goals 7 behinds to
nil. The next turn was South Australia’s
and at half-time the Wheatfielders had
put on 7 goals 6 behinds to 2 behinds
by the opposition. Victoria again went
ahead in the third quarter and had up
12 goals 15 behinds to South Australia’s
8-6. In spite of strenuous endeavor by
the Croweaters, the dogged Victorians
forged still further ahead in the final
splash, and ran out carnival premiers by
15- (106) to 9-8 (62). N.S.W. and West-
ralia met in an earlier match, the home
side making a much better showing than
was expected. Westralia won 17-22 to
16-
* * * *
The Wallabies were beaten in the third
Test against .South Africa at Johannes-
burg, final scores being 12-3, or two tries,
one converted, and a dropped goal to a
try. South Africa had brought new blood
into the forwards and this proved effec-
tive, the weight of the newcomers telling
in the second half, after the half-time
whistle had gone with no score to either
side. In the opening stages of the second
half the South African attack battered
through for two tries. The Australians
rallied and the remainder of the game
saw them attacking strongly. Only one
try resulted from many opportunities,
Cowper scoring from a cross kick by
McLean, after Osier had snapped a field
goal. Billmann had several chances from
penalties but did no good. There was
a crowd of 30,000, a record for South
Africa. The fourth Test will be played
at Port Elizabeth, at sea level, on August
26. If the Wallabies win, the final at
Bloemfontein on September 2 should
draw all South Africa.
* * * *
The first meeting in Sydney this season
of the N.S.W. and Queensland Rugby
Union sides at North Sydney Oval was
something of a disappointment. In the
Brisbane matches N.S.W. had got home
by a bare margin in each game. On
Saturday it won by 34-14, or 6 tries to 4.
with Barnes converting 5 tries for N.S.W.
and adding 2 penalty goals, while Queens-
land improved only one try. In the
second hall the visitors wilted and for a
time, with fulbback Hayes off the field,
the opposition ran riot, adding 13 points.
The Maroons rallied towards the finish
and died game at least. The chief factor
in their defeat was the execrable packing
of their scrum. In lineouts Dore did
well. Lee, a diminutive Chinese from
Queensland Uni., proved a find as a
scrum-half. The star of the home side
was Barnes, at five-eighth. In the early
game Western Districts made an excel-
lent showing against a strong Metropoli-
tan side, going down 11-10.
* * * *
Sydney’s Rugby League grade fixtures
on Saturday saw the rise of Newtown
continue. The old club beat St. George
well by 13-2, and now heads the grade
table by a point. Only one try was scored
in the match, Mork crossing for New-
town. Righton converted this, and kicked
a penalty, while Gilmore and Ellis each
added another. Robinson landed a p.g.
for the Saints. Balmain drew with North
Sydney at Chatswood 12-12. South Syd-
ney, a fading ember these days, could
only draw 20-20 with University at Mar-
rickville. At Pratten Park Eastern Sub-
urbs beat Western 15-10.

The untimely death in a Malta hospi-
tal of Ray Morris last week came as
a shock to all followers of Australian
football of whatever code. On his.way
to England with the Australian League
side he developed ear trouble, and after
an apparent recovery suffered a relapse.
He was landed at Malta, and an opera-
tion failed to save his life. A fine type
of Australian athlete, the N.S.W. Western
Suburbs and University centre-three-
quarter was only 25.

“Rover”: The annual meeting of the
Australian Rules Football Council, to
which all the States send delegates, was
naturally held in Sydney, and two or three
important alterations in the rules and pro-
cedure resulted. Most important was a
new method of voting for alteration of
the constitution. The States have been
divided into major and minor groups, and
alterations may now be made on the
affirmative votes of three major and one
minor, or of two major and two minor,
instead of the three-fourths’ majority pre-
viously required. The major States are
Victoria, South Australia and Westralia;
the minor, N.S.W., Queensland and Tas-
mania. Canberra will not have a vote.
The flick pass, by which the ball may
be passed by a pat or scoop with the
open hand instead of by a blow with
the clenched fist, has been restored to the
rules. South’s desire to reintroduce the
former throw-in rule was defeated, and
the present out-of-bounds rule stands.
* * * *
The Wallabies met the Transvaal at
Jo’burg the week before the third Test,
and, though they were beaten 9-11, made
a very satisfactory showing. Each side
scored two tries and a penalty goal, but
Transvaal converted one try and won the
match in the last couple of minutes with
its penalty, which was for offside. Trans-
vaal has not been beaten on its own
ground by a touring side for donkey’s
years, both Britain and the All Blacks
having taken the knock there.
* * * *
“Der Jong”: South African exchanges
show that the Wallabies are drawing
money that even the big Victorian clubs
would like to pouch, though the prices
charged, ranging as they do from a pound
down for the big games, would cause a
football revolution in Australia. The
first four matches at Durban, Potchef-
stroom, Jo’burg and Pretoria drew £7323.
The Jo’burg gate was £3200, Pretoria
£1750, Durban £1660 and Potchefstroom
£750, though the last is in the dorp
class and smaller than many N.S.W.
country centres.
* * * *
“Hooker”: Jan McShane, the N.S.W.
Rugby Union scrum-half and captain,
put in a strenuous week end. On Satur-
day and Monday he led his State’s side
against Queensland; on Tuesday he
hopped aboard the lugger on his way to
England and Oxford, where he will do
time as a Rhodes scholar. One of the
best scrum-halves Sydney Uni. has turned
out, it is fairly certain that Jan will
get his Rugby Blue at Oxford like his
fellow-Uni. player, “Butts” Lamport, also
a scrum-half, and last year captain of the
Oxford XV.
* * * :’=
“Old Q.”: Time brings its revenges.
The other day in Sydney, H. Flegg,
president of the N.S.W. Rugby League,
protested vehemently at the project to
form a new code of football from the
League and Australian Rules and de-
clared those fathering the idea to be
guilty of disloyalty to the League. Some
27 years ago, certain Sydney Union foot-
ballers, dissatisfied with the amateurism
of the Rugby Union and seeing good
pickings in the professional League, in-
troduced the Northern Union or League
code from the North of England. The
breakaway was greatly helped by the
purchase for the new game of a number
of the Union Wallabies who had just re-
turned from a triumphal tour of Brit-
ain. There was no talk then or since by
Mr. Flegg—himself a N.S.W. Union rep-
resentative —or any of his fellows of “dis-
loyalty” to the Rugby Union. Circum-
stances certainly alter cases.
* * *
“Combo”: A pleasing interlude in the
Rugby League programme in Queensland
was the staging in Brisbane of a match
for the Abo. League championship be-
tween Woorabinda and Cherbourg teams.
The star of the tussle was one Richards,
a flourbag abo. whose age was given at
57. The old gentleman worked the scrum
for Woorabinda and gave a display which
suggested that his age was nearer 17 than
that officially published.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Divot Digger”: Golfing crows are not
heard of in Britain, but occasionally one
hears of the fowls of the air interfering
with the serious business of golf. One
such was reported recently when a
player followed his ball into the rough to
find it balanced on top of three eggs in
a yellowhammer’s nest. When found the
eggs were uninjured, but what happened
then is unknown. One would like to say
the player picked his ball off the eggs with
a niblick, as Joe Kirkwood used to play
one off a watch-glass, without breaking
anything, but that would be intruding on
the realms of fiction. Under Rule 12,
loose impediments not in a hazard may
be removed without penalty. Here there
were three loose impediments.
* * * *
“Colonel D.”: I. notice that all the
players in a women’s golf game in Vic-
toria were disqualified under the rules,
with one exception, for stopping play
during a thunderstorm. I am prepared
to wager that the player who persevered
was not carrying the looking-glass which
women cart round in the ball pocket of
their golf-bags. If there is one article of
faith more firmly planted in femininity
than another it is that a mirror attracts
lightning. That is, in my, opinion, the
reason why all the other playerettes were
content to incur disqualification rather
than abandon their customary outfit of
lipstick, powder-puff and mirror during
the game.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The Victorian golfers are
certain that the offer of £5OOO in prize-
MANAGER OF INJURED WRESTLER: “Is it a serious case, doctor?"

money for a big professional golf tour-
ney during the centenary jubilations next
year will bi'ing a big contingent of the
world’s best pros, to Yarra banks. If
they do come, it will simply be a case of
how the visitors will cut up the money.
Neither in the professional nor amateur
ranks are our players equal to Ameri-
cans or British. They are too far from
big golf and never get the experience
or the practice in first-class company.
* * * *
“Sandringham”: This year’s Australian
golf championship meeting, which opens
on the Royal Melbourne’s links at Chel-
tenham on September 14, has drawn a
strong entry from N.S.W. and South
Australia. The Ma State will be minus
the services of Bettington, last year's
amateur champion, but Hattersley, Far-
rier, Eric Apperly, R. K. Brown and
others of light and leading in the game
are packing their kit to invade the Cab-
bage Garden. The professional army,
headed by C. Gray, Tom Howard, Frank
Eyre and W. Bolger, will also be a for-
midable array in the open.
Car and Cycle
“Formula”: The Australian speed
motorist John Cobb (B. 12/7/’33) tried
out the new car designed for him by Her-
bert Railton at Brooklands. Cobb won
the 64-mile handicap at an average of
122.33 m.p.h. The Napier-engined car
has been produced to lower some of Uie
Continental records, notably Marchand’s
2723 miles in 24 hours. Whether Cobb
can keep up his Brooklands speed at
Montlhery for the long run remains to
be seen.
♦ * * *
“Boneyard”: Yankeeland being partial
to doing things on a large scale, it is not
surprising to hear that last year the New
York Sanitation Department spent £25,000
just in removing from the streets close on
11,000 motor-cars abandoned in them.
In addition to these some thousands of
cars abandoned on waste ground were
left there, none of the city departments
admitting responsibility. The woodwork
and upholstery of the gathered-in cars
were destroyed by burning, metal parts
being cut up with acetylene torches fox-
scrap.
* * * *
“Kick-Starter”: The increasing use of
the motor-cycle in the British army gave
the puffing-billy riders a chance to show
their paces at the recent Royal Military
Tournament in London. Teams from the
Signals Corps put up some wonderful
stunts in competition with horses. Jumps
of over 40ft. were made on the cycles, the
machines rising 6ft. into the air ; and they
took part against horses in jumping races
and other events with remarkable results.
roller” : Hubert Opperman, who
holds most of the Australian road
records, has been riding in Westralia for
some months. He is shortly to attempt
a new set of figures for the Kalgoorlie-
Perth run of 371 miles, starting on Sep-
tember 8. The present best is 53 hours,
and the Victorian considers he can cut
this to 29 without undue exertion. He
has already done 416 miles unpaced in
24 hours in Victoria.
Racquet and Bawl
“Milton”: Queensland’s woman tennis
players astonished the visiting N.S.W.
team by winning every rubber in the
inter-State match. The big surprise was
the defeat of Joan Hartigan by Mrs.
Westmacott (Miss Hood of other days)
and Mrs. Molesworth. The Queensland
pair also walked off with the doubles
from Misses Hartigan and Hall, and will
be a tough proposition in all events at
the Australian championships this com-
ing season.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: There is every
chance that this tennis tour abroad will
show a profit. Estimated receipts up to
the time the team left for America were
£2315, with expenses totalling £1386. On
top of that is the American offer, which
should work out at considerably over the
cost of the short tour in the States. The
cutting out of the Californian games will
now enable Crawford and co. to sail
from 'Frisco on October 9 instead of a
fortnight later.
* * * *
“Kooyong”: The coming of an Eng-
lish tennis team next season is practically
arranged. The Australian authorities have
offered a £2OOO guarantee, or 33 1-3 p.c.
of the gates, for five Tests, one in each
of the five mainland States. Tasmania will
see the visitors in exhibition matches
only. There is some uncertainty as to
whether England’s best team will be able
to come. Failing that the offer may fall
through.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro”: Australian tennis
addicts got a shock when a cable stated
that Vines, Cochet, Crawford and Perry
might join up with Tilden and exploit pro-
fessional tennis, inaugurating, perhaps, a
professional tourney in opposition to the
Davis Cup events. Crawford, for his
part, has denied the report. The men
cannot be blamed if they go over, since
none of them is wealthy and there is big
money in American professional tennis.
Miscellaneous
“Slip”: Surrey County Club, which con-
trols Kennington Oval, is already selling
seats for the fifth Test match next year.
Prices range from 3s. to 125., and pur-
chasers are warned that they buy at their
own risk ; money will not be returned.
This suggests that our old friend Jardine
is now treasurer as well as captain of the
Surrey club.
* * * *
The annual report of the N.S.W.
Cricket Association shows a surplus for
the year of £5052, as against a debit of
£lOll for the previous balance. The
good result was due chiefly to the
Jardine visitation, net proceeds of which
came to £11,677, a trifle better than the
collections for Chapman’s tour. Takings
at inter-State matches improved. Though
the Sydney match with Queensland saw a
£lOO loss, there were decent profits from
the Victorian and South Australian
games in Sydney. Good progress has
been made with the Association’s big
ground at North Brighton, where five
playing areas have been levelled and
wickets made.
$ * $ . *
“Newtown”: Sydney University
athletes of all kinds and both sexes will
sadly miss A. A. Chislett (“Chis”), who
called it a day recently at 76, after 54
years of zealous service as caretaker of
University oval. He came from Sydney
Cricket Ground in 1879 to take charge of
what was then an unfenced paddock and
converted it into one of Sydney’s best
sporting arenas. Many lads passed under
“Chis’s” eye who became notable in law,
medicine and other professions, as well
as in sport, and he had a keen memory
for their youthful peculiarities. He lived
on the ground, which was his whole exist-
ence, and at his special request his funeral
moved from the old cottage he had occu-
pied for so long.

AMONG THE NEW ROSES.
Mrs. Lydia Limelight. —This heavily-
scented hybrid perpetual is a hardy
climber. Becomes more vigorous with
age, though the bloom fades quickly.
Sometimes inclined to mildew, but re-
sponds to treatment with soft soap.
Withers if put in the
shade, but revels in strong
“Sun”-light. Even ex-
tremely cold conditions
cannot knock it back.
Thrives in districts like
Rose Bay.
Prosperity. —Of weak,
spindly and slow growth,
this dwarf is claimed to be
delightful in bloom. Sub-
ject, however, to “die-
back.” Though not yet
fulfilling its early promise,
great hopes are held out
for it by the raisers. Not
so robust as the parent,
“1928.” Seems to do best
around a corner.
The Colonel. —A tee-
rose which has achieved
great popularity through-
out the suburbs. In its
early stages the heads have
a tendency to snap off.
Beginners should refrain
from turning earth over
too much. A sport from
“St. Andrews.”
Souvenir de Taxation.
—A rambler of truly re-
markable growth. If
allowed to run unchecked
will choke everything
within reach, and therefore should be
heavily pruned. When in full bloom is
very appealing. Growers will need to be
careful of the slugs. A very thorny one.
Comrade Jock. —A Scottish importa-
tion which has done astonishingly well
under Australian conditions. Color vivid
red fading to pale pink. Very hard
to beat in a group.

victuallers. Yet I often think we were
“Stage door? We haven’t got one; this is a picture-
show.”
"Well, what’s the girl in the bathroom scene doing
to-night?”

got a job, bought things from butchers,

fair cows who recite and silly asses who
are tigers for kids’ games. Then you have
the would-be lions of the evening, and
the old goats who horn in on the amuse-
ments of the young bucks and monkey
about generally. Anyhow a baby hippo,
would make as good a dancing partner
as some of the flappers who go to

Ever to the fore in divining present-

ence Schools, Ltd., have pleasure in
announcing a new course which should
gain instant popularity.
The mere technique of your particular
sport we leave to the professional tutor.
But do you know enough of the cultural
side of it? Are you, for instance, miser-
ably tongue-tied, aware of your painful
paucity of words, as you irascibly survey
your wrecked mid-iron?
You, too, if you go the right way about
it, will be able to reel off a brilliant
array of full-blooded ex-
pletives that will be the
envy of your fellow-
golfers. This class is un-
der the expert guidance of
an ex-M.L.A., who has as
assistant a bullock-drover
of over 30 years’ experi-
ence.
Don’t let your partner
beat you at what, after all,
is one of the chief points
of the game. A victory
over an opponent by 5 up
and 4 is hollow—robbed
of its greatest sweets —if
he has outsworn you by
45 oaths to 6.
Few “Hill” barrackers
can produce the brilliant
witticisms which convulse
Test crowds. Our splen-
did course will teach you
the snappiest sarcasms of
the hour. Join now and
prepare for the English-
men’s next tour. There
may be money in it.
Remember Yabba and his “Sun” con-
tract. You couldn’t be in better hands

Too Old At
Vitality comes this
simple way
TIRED-OUT with constant pain ! Back
breaking, limbs like pieces of lead, head-
ache, tragic daily torture making you look
so old—wouldn’t it be glorious to end this
misery and throw away the age-giving
mask of pain ?
The cause of your trouble is told in two words—
Kidney Trouble. The kidneys are failing to purify
the blood. Poisons are accumulating which cause
dreadful pain and suffering.
You will never regain health, youthful vigour
and vitality until you have prompted the kidneys to
healthy action. The best and quickest means to this
end is a short course with De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills. They make you feel so gloriously fit,
feeling, looking years younger.
RELIEF IN 24 HOURS
Take two at night, then one before meals. In
24 hours you will see they are doing you good.
Persevere and your troubles will end. Invaluable in
all cases of Rheumatism, Joint Pains, Chronic Back-
ache, Urinary Trouble, Sciatica, Kidney and Uric Acid Troubles. They can be
taken by the very young, the weakest, the oldest and women at all times, with
confidence. No dangerous drugs or purgatives, but a scientific preparation that will
do you good from the very first dose.
It is no use doping the system with drugs, pick-me-ups or purgatives in the
hope of getting back new vigour, when the trouble lies within the system, through
faulty kidney action.
It is the testimony of not one but thousands of one-time sufferers which enables
us to state that if you will commence a course with this simple, straight-forward
remedy, De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, your pain and weakness will be
ended for good.
It does not matter how long you have suffered or what disappointments you
may have had in the past—get a supply of this tried and trusted, 45-year-old
remedy to-day and start strengthening the kidneys, toning up your nervous system
and building once again the real foundations of health.
Why wait to get too-old looking?—why wait for total health breakdown?—
when De Witt’s Pills can so surely and certainly banish the poisons, such as uric
acid, in your system, which are the cause of your pain. You cannot have De Witt’s
Pills and illness—which will you have?
Years Roll Back
THIS REMEDY CAN, WILL
AND MUST BRING HEALTH
AND HAPPINESS!
We wish we could show you the thousands of
letters from grateful sufferers that tell you how
simple, inexpensive and how sure are the results
achieved by De Witt’s Pills. Many bed-ridden,
thousands suffering “untold agonies,” have enjoyed
a new lease of life and happiness, thanks to this
remedy.
If you persevere with this tried and trusted
remedy, you will find your old, tired, “worn-out”
feeling replaced by new vigour and vitality. Your
day’s work will be a pleasure and your spare-time
pleasures doubled. No more sallow, spotty com-
plexion, no more sleepless nights, no more stabs in
the back, no more rheumatic pains, bad back,
bladder troubles.
Remember the name. See it printed on each
package. With complete confidence we state there
is no remedy that will so quickly, so surely rebuild
your health and strength. Surely you do not want
to stay in pain and weakness when there are thou-
sands of now happy men and women to tell you how
splendidly De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills have
given them new vitality, new health, new hope of
happiness. Make up your mind now. Say “ I will
get back my youthful strength and vigour. I will banish the pain that cripples me,
making my life a constant misery.” Do it now. Go to your chemist right away.
He knows all about this remedy and can tell you how good it really is.
See that you get the genuine De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills in the special
white, blue and gold box. Beware of imitations. Most certainly there is nothing
just as good.

Business, Robbery, Etc.
“Strict Veg.”: Melbourne “souvenir”-
hunters don’t restrict their activities to
charity balls on mail steamers (B.
9/8/’33). They made off with £5OO
worth of silver and glass during the last
12 months from the stock of a single firm
of caterers.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: There is a veneer fac-
tory at Kyogle (N.S.W.) which can use
all the suitable burls sent in. It special-
ises in choice panels for wireless and
other cabinets, trays and tabletops. The
factory, which employs girls to do the
matching, covers about two acres, and is
a great help to the town.
* * * *
“Spelter”: In buying factory-made
goods, Westralia’s Collier Government
gives a first preference to Westralian-
made, a second to Australian-made and
a third to British-made. So, at least, it
is asserted ; but in the latest list of regis-
trations I read that the Premier’s Depart-
ment has bought an American car.
* * * *
“P.T.0.”: The General Motors-Holden
body-building factory at Woodville (S.A.)
is employing 1500 hands, as against 450
a year ago, and doing four times the
business. It has contracts with five Eng-
lish and five American makers of cars,
and has started to export bodies to Java
and Singapore, hitherto a U.S.A. pre-
serve.
* * * *
“Eureka”: Australian equivalents of
the five- and ten-cent stores are spread-
ing to suburbs and country towns, and
forcing the small trader out of business.
When they begin to sell cakes, small-
goods and meat, the cake-shopman, the
smallgoodsman and the butcher can’t
compete with them. If this goes on you
will yet see suburbs with one big store
and rows of empty shops, the former
tenants being on the dole.
* * *
“Kariah”: A small fortune awaits the
inventor of a device by means of which
oysters may be shipped to market with
a minimum of loss through damage by
slings and the like. In N. S. Wales
oysters are consigned in three-bushel
bags, and as buyers insist on having them
“tight,” growers have to bang and force
a few extra dozen in to keep the bag
stretched.
* * * *
“L.A.S.”: I wrote to a Queensland
State electoral registrar for a claim card.
It came by penny-packet post in a big
envelope with my name and address on
the back, the front being left for the
return-journey address. “A neat device,”
I thought—“one envelope instead of
two” ; and then I noted a shy little notice
in a corner: “Affix stamp.” Return post-
age for a thing that always went free! !
won’t “affix stamp.” I’ll take the card
round to the registrar and give him a
nasty look.
* * * :Jc
“H.N.J.”: Vic. Forests Commission
runs —at a loss, of course —a timber-
seasoning and -planing mill at Newport.
Private sawmillers are feeling the effects
of competition with this plant. They
have up-to-date seasoning and milling
plants, but they get no orders from the
railways or other departments, as Govern-
ment architects, when calling tenders for
a job, invariably specify that timber from
the Government plant must be used. Yet
these sawmillers provide the commission
with practically all its revenue.
# * * *
“L. R. Russ”: Reported that com-
plaints have been made regarding the
quality of Australian-made galvanised-
iron. Here’s my experience. Three years
ago I had two tanks erected. While
having some alterations made I noticed
that one was badly riddled. The local
supplier told me that the concern from
which he had obtained the iron was now
guaranteeing its product, and might re-
place the tank. Correspondence passed,
and the firm replied that the iron sup-
plied to me had been imported, and that
the guarantee applied only to its own
manufacture. It finally made me an
allowance.
* * * *
“Aub-aub Bird”: It is plain that there
is a large illegal export of N.S.W. ’pos-
sum skins ; but the authorities have only
themselves to blame. When they declare
an open season the local constable issues
certificates to trappers as their legal
authority for holding skins. It is easy
for unscrupulous traders to store up cer-
tificates to cover illegal purchases. In
Westralia ’possum skins go through the
hands of Government officials. Every
skin is stamped, and the Government col-
lects revenue. This is a local safeguard
which should be generally adopted. And
I am sure our Governments could come
to some arrangement whereby British
and American authorities would not
allow skins on their markets without a
Government stamp.
Answers to Correspondents
No notice (except of a hostile character) will
be taken of communications insufficiently
stamped. Name and address must appear on
the MS. No liability is undertaken re con-
tributions voluntarily submitted; and no MS.
will be returned unless stamps accompany.
B.O.: Contains some good lines, marred by
sudden declensions into the sadly prosaic and
the near-bathetic. If you can weed out these
blemishes, there is good hope for y0u....

lacks the charm of the unknown bard who

The sun shines bright on Garden Isle, where lies our

foe c6uld beat;

drill,
But can they a continent defend, with ever so good

the defect is that they convey so little. There
isn’t a line that stirs or sticks... .H.W.8.:
“To dispel possible doubt I will men-
tion that the verses are original.” Unnecessary.

bees,” “basking lizards,” “hopping wagtails”--

Lord help you! J.C.G.: Could hardly be
more unsuitable... . K.R.: Admirable philosophy
in execrable lines... .1.C.: You seem to have a
distinct turn for light verse. Now find some-
thing nearer home than Bernard Shaw and
London’s West End to hang it on J. 8.:
Too long; and don’t write in pencil... .T.A.W.:

“Urger”: Even if they are not a suc-
cess as beef cattle, the zebus (B. 9/8/’33)
might afford another sport to Australians,
always on the hunt for a new way of los-
ing their money. In central and southern
India there is a special zebu used for
transport in light carts, and a pair of
these little chaps on the trot can make
a good Waler step it. Native potentates
employ them for trotting races, and this
is where they might come in here. “The
dogs” seem to be up to putty now and
these little bullocks might prove a valu-
able reinforcement to the “Red Hots.”
If the wowsers made any objection to the
new sport we could always spring the
joke that it was improving the breed of
cattle. Apart from which the zebu has
a hallowed place in British military his-
tory. Wellington won his Indian wars
with him, and ever afterwards thought
of campaigns largely in terms of bul-
locks.
* :|: * *
“Bribie”: There is a lot of Moreton
Island, which shuts in the great bay into
which the Brisbane River runs, but it
has an unpleasant habit of returning to
the sea in considerable sections for no
apparent reason. The other day a chunk
of the foreshore 250 yards long and 100
yards deep departed in the night. It
Chow Teu and Co.
“Kaloa”: The Bulletin (2/8/’33) was
right in what it said about the foreign
element in the Mandated Territory.
Reading the “Handbook of New Guinea,”
I find that the list of commercial distri-
butors for the Territory starts off with
B.P. and Carpenters and E. Paatsch,
who is the German Consul and an expro-
priated planter, followed by Alois
Akun. Thereafter it plunges into a sea
of Cantonese and Japanese in which an
occasional O’Connor rides like a lonely
coral islet.
Kwong Hung Hing, Tsurushima,
Wankong, Wing Wah Chong, Hop
Wo Chong, Shui Loon —it goes on like
that through inches of print. Something,
however, can be said for the Oriental
nomenclature of commerce —it is more
succinctly appropriate to trade than the
Australian brand. Chui Gum, for in-
stance, is not so bad an effort for a
general store —the gent, operates at Kae-
vieng ; Ah Khum has an inviting sound.;
Chow Teu is self-evident, as also is Lin
Fat. See Ho He is his own slogan, but
Shun Chong sounds more like the advice
of a rival than advertising.
European customers of these people,
however, would get painful shocks if they
could understand a little Cantonese. In
one Queensland town the window bears
the sign “Duck Shun —We are cheapest
in town.” Duck Shun means “quick
profit”!
“Arunta”: I was not wrong (“Cossy,”
B. 9/8/’33) when I said that it was un-
likely that Leichhardt ever got to the
N.T. on his last trip. I have been over
virtually the whole of his first-expedition
route. Gregory’s private opinion—l heard
him express it myself—was that he did
not get to the Elsey on his second trip.
He could easily have disappeared in any
big western flood without ever having
been found again. As for the waggon
and the bullock horns—well, dozens and
dozens of waggons went across from
Western Australia in the gold days, and
I have no doubt that some of them took
the wrong turning. That grand old
pioneer Mrs. Gordon, of the Victoria
Hotel in Darwin, who made the journey
successfully, might tell “Cossy” some-
thing about that exodus.
H* ❖ »i»
“Tintinchilla”: So they are shearing
260,000 on Kooba in the Riverina this
season, and it is “thought to be a record
for Australia and perhaps for the world.”
It is not. Milo (Q.), at one time, long be-
fore closer settlement, didn’t reckon it
had a season at all unless it saw 200,000
stripped, and 250,000 to 280,000 was a
fairly regular thing. The office ringer
says that in his memory Bowen Downs,
which carried a million woollies, de-
coated as many as 400,000 one glorious
spring. There must be others just as big.

“Cutter”: Queensland, which has a
long experience of plant pests, is view-
ing with disgust the establishment of a
newcomer —the galvanised burr, which is
spreading fast in the central and south-
western parts. The plant carries a
heavy spine in addition to the burry seed-
pods, so stock will not eat it. It mats
so thickly that it kills grass. No one
seems to know whence it came, though it
made its first appearance at Alpha and
soon spread. The local authorities’ con-
ference in Brisbane has admitted that it
is beyond the power of the grazier and
the local authorities to cope with the
burr, and the usual appeal is being made
to the Government to take measures to
prevent its extension to clean areas and
to get the C.S.I.R. to hunt up a method
of eradication.
* * =!= *
“Hermitage”: The boom in tobacco-
growing in Queensland extends. A con-
cern which has established the largest
plantation in Victoria on the Buffalo
River has taken up 2000 acres in the
Bundaberg district, and is setting about
preparing it for planting. Managing-
director A. V. Renowden considers
Queensland can produce ten times more
bright leaf-tobacco than all the other
States put together, geographical and
climatic conditions being ideal in many
districts. Southern tobacco is essentially
a blending variety, the Queensland article
being what is known in the trade as a
neutral leaf to which the leaf of the
other States is added as a blend.
NEIGHBOR: “Did yer take the missus to Brisbane with yer for the Show?"
D AD: “No chance! Someone’s got to stay behind to mind me watch and chain."
made no fuss about it either, for the first
the lightkeeper at Comboyuro Point
knew about it was when he rose in the
morning to put the light out and saw
water where previously there had been
land. The slip brought the light 120
yards closer to the water than it had been
before, and it will probably have to be
shifted to safer ground, as has happened
in the past. The island is almost en-
tirely sand, but v/hat it loses in slips is
made up in other parts by the action of
sea and wind. The curious part of these
slides is their noiselessness.

“Macti”: “Yes! Every country he got
different kind animal,” said Jimmy Susu,
contemplating a recently-acquired cocka-
too. “That cocky, I been get him ’long
mainland, and now he talk proper good.
He clever like ’ell, that cocky. But he
no all same monkey. Before, I been
go ’long Thursday Island, and look ’long
auction sale. They sell one monkey,
small one —he been come along some
boat, I t’ink, belong India or some
’nother place. I pay that monkey, give
five bob, and everybody he make laugh,
and say ‘Two one kind now!’ I take
him ’long boat and bring him to island
belong me. That monkey he make
everybody fright! Along boat, he pick
up my pillow and blanket and hat, and
chuck overboard. I make him fast ’long
rope then, and he kai-kai one man along
leg. When we come home now, I make
small room belong him, and give him
blanket from flour-bag. Everybody
come for look at that monkey. When
he go for sleep, he lie down and cover
up his head along blanket, all same we.
I put kai-kai on plate for him, and give
him pannikin water; he eat that kai-kai
and water all same you and me, then
he capsize water along plate and wash
hand, and drink that water, all same
man. Only one t’ing, he no talk.
S’pose I can learn him talk proper
English all same this cocky, I t’ink that
monkey he number one. But I been lose
him ’long time now. One man he gam-
mon fight him, and he bite him ’long
leg, and that man he get gun and shoot
him. That man he been die, finish, him-
self next week, though—might that mon-

“Selma”: We went along the other
evening to our suburban picture show
and saw a Hollywood production in
which the beautiful heroine severs by law
her tie with the usual worthless husband.
In the next scene she is discovered living
alone in a flat, her clothes being of super-
latively decorative variety. Just as she
was posing in a wonderful lace-and-fur
creation a small voice arose out of the
darkness. “Gee, mum,” it said, “she must
git her allermony reg’ler.”

“Wai-hoi”: Baron von Mueller, men-
tioned by “Pit Sawyer” (B. 2/8/’33),
though he did a lot for Australian botany
was about the world’s worst bushman.
In 1855 he went with A. C. Gregory’s
expedition to North Australia as natural-
ist. Whenever he left camp on a botan-
ising jaunt it was always a toss-up
whether he would return safe or have
to be searched for by the party. He
got astray near a huge, reedy swamp back
from the Victoria, and had a pretty close go
for it. On many other occasions, having
become intensely interested in his plant-
collecting, he was found completely ex-
hausted miles from where he thought he
was. But he lived to be nearly 80.
Gals* Gossip from Brisbane
Crowded streets, trams, shops, theatres
and smiling faces —that’s what we’re ex-
periencing up here. We’re liking it, and
the Show’s not over yet. Things began
to be really gay at Lennon’s on Anzac
Ball night, when many dined and wined
before taxi-ing to the City Hall for the
Military Ball. It was good to see the
dance such a success. A handsome
cheque will be handed over to the
Diggers.
A roll of drums ushered in the
vice-regal party. Lady Wilson, in flash-
ing gold satin, was attractive; Marjorie
wore misty blue, and her friend Dinah
Hordern, who has been seen in some
lovely creations, wore a dullish bronze
frock. The Glasgow lady, one of the hard-
working committee women, was in a soft
violet shade, and the Cameron lady, petite
and dainty, wore pale rose. Bridge was
arranged on the platform. Mrs. Tyr-
whitt and Mrs. C. Jameson (wife of our
ex-Judge) were among those who tried
to concentrate on a little game. There
were four debs, presented to our Exes.
Marjorie Wilson showed her sympathy
for the District Nursing Association by
being president for a ball in the Troc. Sir
Leslie and Lady Wilson took Dinah
Hordern and Amy Smith. Margaret Wil-
son and Nora Halford met them at the
door and gave them pretty bouquets.
Lady Wilson seems to favor “a wearing
of the green,” as that was the color she
chose the first day of the Government
House garden party. At the dance she
wore green again. Marjorie wore butter-
cup yellow; Amy Smith was in robin
red, and Dinah Hordern chose grey.
Betty Price and Molly. Mills were the
debs., and both looked deb.-like in long
white frocks and carried orthodox posies.
The same night at the Masonic Ball
at City Hall ten debs, danced to the
strains of “The Merry Widow” waltz after
they had been presented to knight James
Blair and his lady. He whispered some-
thing nice to each one as he received
them, and she thanked the committee for
the lovely autumn bouquet.
In brilliant sunshine the usual ticket-
holders assembled on the lawns at Gov-
ernment House for their annual inspec-
tion of the garden, which was massed
with marigolds, stocks and Iceland pop-
pies. For two days our Exes, received the
throng. Premier Forgan Smith arrived,
but without his wife ; she was recovering
from a cold. William Cullen brought
Ailsa. The Mayoral Greenes were there,
too. On both days Girl Guides and
Boy Scouts made themselves useful.
Once a year Brisbane gets a little
bit of fleet, and when the Canberra was
opened for inspection 20,000 planked the
gangway. Many youngsters from out
west, under Y.A.L. care, had a great day
on the Largs Bay. Most of them were
seeing a ship for the first time, and plied
the captain with questions. He had an-
swers for all, and now shares their affec-
tions with Laurel and Hardy.
A courageous and cheerful soul passed
away when Mrs. Bertha Banfield, widow
of E. J. Banfield, “The Beachcomber,” died
at Wynnum at 76. For many years she
and her husband lived on Dunk Island,
between Townsville and Cairns. It was
there ten years ago that Mrs. Banfield
was left alone with her dead husband’s
body for some days until she succeeded
in signalling a passing steamer.
Although there had been some pre-
liminary parties—and good ones, too —
the United Service Ball was the first held
at which the Fleet was present. For
this dance 28 debs, had saved themselves
to be presented to his Ex. Lady Wilson
was not present, but Sir Leslie brought
Marjorie, in soft rose pink, and Amy
Smith and Dinah Hordern. The Blair
lady wore a midnight-blue lace affair.
Mrs. Marshall A’Deane, accompanied
by gold-braided husband, introduced a
bit of white organdie on her black satin
gown. Captain F. C. Bradley, from
H.M.A.S. Canberra, brought Mrs. Brad-
ley, whose lipstick-red frock was studded
with diamente. Mrs. K. A. Willis did
the presenting of debs., and her bright-
blue frock was relieved with velvet frills.
Ailsa Cullen wore Nile-green lace, and
green was also chosen by Prof. Richards’s
wife, who was busy looking after her
debutante daughter Peggy.
In a ballroom transformed into a
sunlit garden, ablaze with nasturtiums,
sunflowers and golden chrysanthemums,
the gay things danced the next night in
the South Brisbane Technical College at
the Girl Guide Ball. This is always one
of the swagger balls of the week, and
the frocking indicated its importance.
Knight Macartney’s lady, State president,
met the vice-regals, who beamed at the
36 neat little Guides forming a guard
of honor. Lady Wilson’s satin frock was
of buttercup yellow; Marjorie, herself a
Guide lieutenant, wore the same tonings
for her frock.
At the City Hall P.M. Lyons, who
had only a few hours before arrived by
train, attended the Nudgee College Old
Boys’ dance. He did not look a bit
travel-tired as he was greeted by presi-
dent Neal Macrossan and Mrs. Macros-
san, in apple-green with sequined cape.
Her father, T. C. Beirne, had his dance
programme full. Archbishop Duhig was
present, and our CJ. and his lady and
the Mayoral Greenes helped to make the
party.
Long before the first race at the
B.T.C.’s mid-week Exhibition meeting,
the tickets were being punched at the
turnstile. Our weather continued kind,
but the crowd was almost too large for
the women scribes to see the tuckings
on the frocks. However, it was noticed
that millinery was frequently trimmed
with organdie.
In a room in Shell House, the Girl
Guides put on an exhibition of then-
own handicrafts. From the practical dis-
play of home sewing and home cooking
and that of making furniture from manu-
facture boxes, one turned to a very clever
model of our Anzac Square, with the
Eternal Flame lit by oil and backed by
groups of sailors, soldiers and nurses
complete with poppy wreaths. A lighter
side of the exhibits was the miniature
zoo, housed with elephants, native bears
and monkeys, guarded by a miniature
Brownie.

LIFE —A BUSINESS
It is a paradox, perhaps, that while Home Life is a refuge from
business, it is itself a business.
Money enters so largely into everything that it must be planned
for in every phase of life.
It is in business that money is earned, in the Home, chiefly, that it
is spent, and there is no sound reason why the spending should not be
regarded as being just as important as earning. In fact, it is far more
important, for earning is difficult, and must employ wisdom, forethought
and energy, while spending is easy, so easy that there is temptation to
spend unwisely.
Every Home, then, is a business, and needs an economic system, of
which the Savings Bank Pass Book can be the valuable basis.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Highbrow Sydney trooped to the
Savoy during the S.U.D.S.’s three-night
season of “L’Aiglon,” for not only was
that famed play of Rostand’s in aid of
the ’Varsity Settlement Fund but profes-
sorial and professional offspring blos-
somed among the 60-odd characters.
Young Peter Osborn (who made a strik-
ing first appearance earlier in the year
with the Independents in “Caprice”) took
the part of the ill-fated Eaglet; there was
a young Mungo MacCallum on the
boards, and such names as Pilcher,
Windeyer, Ash, Weigall, Mackie, Halse
Rogers, Maxwell and the like occurred
among the courtiers, emperors, soldiers
and beautiful ladies. Mrs. Halse Rogers,
president of the committee, and Mungo
MacCallum’s lady, president of the
Settlement, held quite a reception on the
opening night, when the Consuls for Italy,
France, Belgium and The Netherlands
and their ladies were the guests of honor.
Their Exes., who were to have been there,
were speeding northwards, but they had
cheered the players by visiting the dress
rehearsal the previous night.
The music circle of the Lyceum Club
started the eatinary of Music Week with
a lunch, to which it bade Roland Foster,
the organiser of the Week, the George
Nassoors and Mrs. Walter Swinson.
Elizabeth Plummer presided over the long
table decked with violets, primroses and
hyacinths, wearing a frock that was cor-
nelian-red in shade and a modern ver-
sion of the pelisse in design. Miss Fair-
fax, Maoriland soprano Winnie Fraser
(with whose black suit went a smart grey
hat of spring vintage), and the wife of
America’s Consul-General Caldwell were
others to right and left of the president.
There will be lots of dough in this
tonic sol-fa week ; Roland Foster com-
putes that at a modest estimate the 68
choirs which are journeying to Sydney
for the Eisteddfod will alone spend
no less than £5OOO. All told, there are
over 5400 competitors, and seven of the
city’s halls will be busy as beehives from
the 19th to the 25th while the singers
and the instrumentalists from every cor-
ner of the continent demonstrate what
can be done to the scale without break-
ing the law. Incidentally, both Peter
Dawson and John Brownlee were Eis-
teddfod discoveries.
Carrie Lanceley’s glittering gold lame
coat and turban and Mrs. Norman Lowe’s
portrait were the two most colorful inci-
dents of the Royal Art Society’s party
last week. This was held in the Educa-
tion Gallery, and exhibitors brought their
wives and friends to behold once more
their efforts in color, to drink coffee and
to enjoy F. A. Butler’s lightning sketches
and Muriel Cohen’s sparkling music. J.
J. Hilder’s widow, who was there with
her artist son, Mrs. Harry Julius and
Erik Langker’s blue-eyed little wife were
an attractive trio ; Mary Edwards aired
a handsome white scarf; Arthur Grimm
and Tommy Spencer reminisced on the
creation of such Australian classics as
“How Macdougall Topped the Score,”
for which the latter’s father was respon-
sible ; Alfred Coffey and Gayfield Shaw
worked overtime handing around the
sandwich of sociability, and P. S. Gar-
ling’s big moment came when he had to
announce that the Wynne prize for 1932
had been won by Hans Heysen for his
“Brachina Gorge.” Just within the first
room is a small' picture draped in black
that was never without an old friend
before it paying tribute. It is a painting
by. the recently-dead D. G. Reid, one
of the society’s oldest friends and exhibi-
tors. Already the sales have topped the
three - hundred - guinea mark ; perhaps
Alan Baker’s painting of the Lottery
Office is bringing the luck with it.
Mrs. Rodney Dangar, wearing a blouse
colored like a pale-pink rose with her
navy suit, the outfit served handsomely
with silver fox, opened artist Maud Sher-
wood’s show in the Macquarie Galleries
last Thursday. Architect B. J. Water-
house introduced the lady, who, though
obviously nervous, got through her little
speech with flying colors, after which
the small but very social and artistic
company made slow and discerning pil-
grimage around the walls. The show is
full of color and fine drawing, several
of the garden scenes being glimpses of
the surroundings of Jhe home at Capri
shared by Mrs. .Sherwood and a friend.
Not very far away from them the cele-
brated Axel Munthe, author of “San
Michele,” had his villa. Director of the
National Gallery Jimmy Macdonald
loitered before the joyousness of “The
Yellow and Blue Sail,” which was exhi-
bited at the last Paris Salon, while Flor-
ence Blake and Maude Russell were
absorbed by the vivacity of “The Boot
Market.” The John D. Moores, Julian
Ashton, pretty Margaret Coen and
Edmund Harvey, Dr. Oscar Paul and
Mrs. William Moore were others who
visited the exhibition. Rodney Dangar
arrived late just as the artist was about
to take her trig black-clad figure off
home.
Married at Manly on Thursday last,
Birrell Brewer, son of Harry Brewer, of
singing fame. Birrell comes of a family
of folk addicted to music, though they
haven’t relied on it for their bread and
butter. Brewer, senior, in the spare
moments salvaged from his job at the
Treasury, conducted the choir of the
local R.C. church for many years, and
is one of the highlights and longest-term
members of the Apollo Club. Birrell
has a musical turn himself, though his
main preoccupation is with electricity.
His mother is one of the best-known of
Manly’s organisers in the charity world.
The bride was Gladys Lillis, resident in
Manly, whose people hail from down
Wagga way.
If ever a history of the progress of
Wagner in Australia is written a special
page must be siven to the subject of this
Monte Luke picture. She is Lute Drum-
mond, and her lecture recitals on Wagner
and his works are as illuminating and in-
teresting as enthusiasm and deep know-
ledge can make them. Already Lute has
given “Tristan and Isolde” at the
Teachers’ College, the English-Speaking
Union and at other city clubs ; now she
and soprano-sister Jean and contralto
Alice Prowse are busy rehearsing “Rhine-
gold.” For six years the two Drum-
mond sisters studied opera in Germany,
paying a guinea a lesson to be trained
in the Wagner tradition by Muller, who
for 13 years was in charge of the opera
at Bayreuth.
Melech Ravitch, the striking-looking
Polish poet and playwright with whom
literary Sydney has been getting
acquainted, will be one of the guests
at the P.E.N. Club dinner to-morrow
night, when the new president, knight
Robert Garran, presides for the first
time. The visitor, who has a merry eye
and a lively tongue in spite of his slow
and careful English, is secretary for the
Yiddish P.E.N. Club, and is a front-
ranker among the makers of modern
Yiddish literature. He has published
seven plays, and in all of them tragedy
lurks; in his latest book, “Wife and
Man,” he treats of the striving for domi-
nance by the female.
After making such jokes against the
sex as “The sun shines and man could
be happy—but Hitler and the women
won’t let him! ” and “When 1 go back
to Europe l shall send one hundred mil-
lion people to fill the empty spaces of
Australia —all women!” he smilingly in-
forms you he is a married man.
Sadie Cambridge, the girl in this pic-
ture, and her husband, Albert Enders,
are at the Glaciarium, where they demon-
strate how beautiful a thing ice-skating
can be. The pair won the world’s skating
championship twice in succession in
London ; they also hold championships
for two-stepping and tangoing on the
ice. And Sadie is no cold-climate native.
She’s a Sydney girl, and in her school-
days went to Fort-street Girls’ High. The
Enders couple were instructors at Lon-
don’s most exclusive private rink —the
Grosvenor House Club. Among their
pupils was the Prince of Wales. Photo,
from May Moore.
Arts and Crafters turned up in force
at the Horseshoe to drain a cup of wel-
come to Mrs. E. M. Spring, one of the
earliest members of the society, who has
just returned to Sydney after some years
in London. Mrs. Spring made a success
of her leather work in England, sold
her wares to Royalty, and is proud that
she used only Australian leather and
designs. A posy of the bush flowers
she has so often embossed and tooled
on her work was given to her by
Florence Sulman, who presided over
a group that included silver-worker Mil-
dred Creed, artists in china and glazes
Ada Newman and Mrs. Vi Eyre, Miss
Fairfax, Ethel Stephens, Constance Moser
and the hand-weaving Joan Mackenzie.
The committees and organising staffs
of the Community and St. Margaret’s
hospitals and Dalwood Homes gathered
at the Oriental to welcome George Fitz-
Patrick, returned from Maoriland. The
Brig.-General Lloyds were there, and he
made a speech when George Fitz Patrick
was handed a writing-set of polished
mulga. Walter Kingsmill and his lady,
Mrs. George Fitz Patrick, Sister Kerven,
of the serene eyes, and Mrs. John Eales
were gathered about the festive cake on
the top table. Mrs. Frank Louat was
gaily ruffed in white organdie, Mrs. E.
Baume was smoothly plumaged in off-
white crepe, Mrs. Langton wore pale and
Mrs. J. Coen rose-pink chiffons.
Nancy Rogerson, of Pikedale, Stan-
thorpe, had the prettiest of springtide set-
tings for her exchange of vows with John
Bryant, of Sydney. Spreading branches
of pink peach blossom lavishly adorned
the aisle and chancel of St. Mark’s at
Darling Point, the three ’maids who fol-
lowed the sweeping train of her magnolia-
satin raiment had their arms filled with
the same radiant blossom, and the draw-
ing-room at the Australia, where bride’s
father and mother did the handsome
thing by 100 guests, was like some flower-
ing grove of old Japan.
Sancta Sophia, the sister college to St.
John’s within the Uni., threw its hand-
some doors wide to a stream of joy-
seekers on the night of its yearly dance.
The big reception-room downstairs, giddy
with butterfly bows of red and gold, its
fireplace banked with red and pink sweet-
peas made radiant by a background of
electric bulbs, was used as the ballroom.
If there had been a Jacob present he
could easily have imagined himself hav-
ing his old dream, for between each
dance the stairway was ascended and de-
scended by girls in trailing garments
whose faces, if not exactly angelic, were
beatific with health and happiness. Up-
stairs between dances each student enter-
tained in her room, spacious and made
cosy with gay hangings and the glow of
radiators. Mark Sheldon’s lady, in moon-
light blue crepes, received the guests,
assisted by the college’s senior student,
Sheila Drescher, and dance secretaries
Paddy Kirk ton and Lucy Spruson. Italy’s
Consul-General and his Marchesa were
among the dancers, as was Professor
Fawsitt, and everybody enjoyed the
extras played in dashing style by Nevyl
McColm, whose sister Cyris, in a rustle
of forget-me-not-blue organdie, was one
of the belles of the ball.
Ailsa Sutherland, who went off to Bris-
bane last night for a two-months’ holi-
day, mixed a parting cocktail for her
friends on Saturday. The big reception-
rooms of the Sutherland home at Point
Piper were crowded with young artists,
writers and actors —the last mostly Inde-
pendents, to which group Ailsa belongs.
The hostess, suggesting Tennyson’s Mari-
ana of the Moated Grange in her sweep-
ing black velvet dress with its mediaeval
bodice, wore a wreath of field flowers in
her hair. Cousin Flora Sutherland,
brother Jim and sister Heather helped
mix the cocktails and the guests.
Letters from Marjorie Hambridge tell
of a meeting with Una Bourne, who was
in Sydney some years ago when she was
touring the world as Melba’s pianist.
Nowadays Una is busy making gramo-
phone records. When the North Shore
line girl met her, Una and Miss Hayward
were playing the Brahms A Major Sonata
at the ’Cello Club’s monthly meeting.
Marjorie, who is a violin student of Miss
Hayward at the Royal Academy, goes
to the Continent at the end of the year
for further study. Mother and brother
Rhodes, who is entered for Cambridge,
have just arrived in England.
Director of the Independents Doris
Fitton, having seen the present Savoy
attraction, “Once in a Lifetime.” success-
fully launched, retired to Denholme pri-
vate hospital and produced a beautiful
blonde baby—life-title, Malcolm. The
two are back at home now in Roslyndale-
avenue snowed under with floral votive
offerings.
The Largs Bay is bearing away about
a dozen students and research workers,
among them three old boys of The
King’s School, T. P. Willsallen, N.
Pilcher and J. S. Lewes. Jan McShane,
N.S.W. Rhodes scholar, and Queens-
land Rhodes scholar Coutice are also
aboard. So are Germaine Jopelin, cura-
tor of the Geological Museum at Sydney
Uni., who goes to Cambridge on an in-
ternational fellowship ; pianist Daphne
Cockburn, violinist Joyce Frew and pian-
ist Daphne Harpur.

The Truth
About Catarrh
ft
Remedies Galore
You have, no doubt, tried dozens of
remedies, but you are still looking for the
one that will give you happy relief. The
one remedy you have not tried is waiting
for you—a preparation containing vola-
tile oils known as Catarrh-Clysmac. This
new volatile oil treatment has proved a
boon to thousands of sufferers through-
out Australia. They have found its value
for chronic cold in the head as well as
for Catarrh in its more serious stages.
It has been so thoroughly tested and
proved so consistently true that the
money paid for the first package will be
refunded if it does not do what is
claimed. Catarrh-Clysmac can be bought
from any chemist for 1/9 or nearly three
times the quantity for 4/6.
Melbourne
Chatter
Dressing at Caulfield on Saturday was
wintry, as befits our climate, which is
still in treacherous mood. A dash of
color was introduced here and there in
jabots, collars, cuffs and capes. There
were bows and ties of white organdie,
pique, and spotted and striped silks.
Posies of daphne, orchids and spring
flowers nestled among furs or brightened
coat-lapels, and there was a great out-
break of knitted woollen caps. In the
ladies’ box were Mrs. Ben Chaffey, Mrs.
R. G. Casey and Mrs. Lauchlan Mackin-
non. Mrs. A. Dye’s smart chocolate-
colored coat with its large squirrel collar
was topped by a matching felt hat with
coque feathers. Monica Starke’s costume
of French grey cloth was worn with a
matching felt hat. Mary Baillieu was
wrapped in a brown cloth coat that had
a deep yoke and sleeves of lamb’s-wool.
Valerie Purves came in black cloth topped
with fox furs. The Lud Mayor accom-
panied Cynthia Brookes, who wore a cos-
tume and swathed toque of Lido blue.
Mr. and Mrs. James Purves, Mrs. Herbert
Byrne, Mrs. T. J. Ryan and Jill, Colonel
and Mrs. Erica Harrison and Joan Syme
were amongst those who watched the
racing.
A pouring wet night did not damp the
enthusiasm of members of the R.V.1.8.
auxiliaries, for nearly 500 attended the
institute’s dance at Ormond Hall. A
basket of flowers was presented to the
president of the Council of Combined
Auxiliaries, Mrs. J. Frost. Her gown
of angel-skin of petunia-mauve tint had
a cape of purple velvet. W. H. Richard-
son was hon. ticket sec., and among the
guests was S. W. Hedger, superintendent
of the institute, and his wife, she in a
blue taffeta frock traced with a flowered
design.
Proceeds of a hop at St. Kilda Palais
went to the District Nursing Society.
Mrs. Harold Shackell, who danced in
draperies of vivid green lace, led the
organising committee, vice-presidents of
which were Mrs. E. Drake-Brockman
and Mrs. A. M. Treacy. The hon. secs,
were Ainslie Williams, in black velvet;
Joan Mitchell, in white ninon scattered
with pink flowers, and Nancy Nicholas,
whose gown was of crepe of pale amber
hue.
A dance at the Wattle Path, St. Kilda,
in aid of the Lud Mayor’s Fund, was
organised' by the tenants of the block
of buildings that includes Howey Court,
Capitol House and other offices on the
Howey estate. Lud Mayor Smith, his
fiancee Cynthia Brookes, Mrs. Harry
Emmerton and Mr. and Mrs. Raynes
Dickson were among the special guests.
Former students of the Methodist Ladies’
College assembled at the Wattle for their
17th annual dinner. Nora Collisson, sec-
retary of the Bureau of Social and Inter-
national Affairs, was guest of honor, and
gave an address. Olive Dodd, president
of the Old Collegians’ Club, in gown
of deep-blue lace and velvet jacket, spoke
the welcoming word. The principal of
the college, Rev. J. W. Grove, and Mrs.
Grove were there, also Mrs. R. Landen,
the headmistress, and Edith Barker, the
hon. sec. of the club. The Lowana quar-
tette exercised nicely-blended feminine
voices in numbers by composers past and
present.
On Friday night the Uni. Agricultural
Society had a dance at Admiralty House.
Members of the Architecture Atelier and
the Architectural Students’ Society had
their hop at the Palms, on Henley lawns,
and at Ormond Hall the Engineering
School staged a jollo.
The bunch of girl charity-workers that
styles itself the Ten Fives Club com-
menced its activities with a dance at
Tudor Court, Caulfield, in the interests
of the ward maintained by the Lord
Somers Commemoration League in the
orthopaedic hospital for children at
Frankston. The committee was led by
the president, Mary James, and Mary
Chalmers, hon. sec.
The Findon Hunt Club had disagree-
able weather for its race meeting at
Moonee Valley. Furs and wraps covered
the tailored suits of the fair patrons, and
the attendance was smaller than is usual
at such affairs. The Master of the club,
J. L. Byrne, was there, also the hon. sec.,
R. M. Cuthbertson, the Claude Grices
and representatives of the State’s four
hunt clubs.
Two ’maids in grey velvet trailing
gowns, with matching caps and posies
of pink flowers, formed the retinue of
Lorna, only daughter of Mrs. W. N.
Sommers, of Rotherwood, Wooden, when
she married John, son of the A. E. Cas-
leys, of Ballarat, at Queen’s College
chapel. The bride was arrayed in ivory
velvet, with tulle and orange buds.
The wedding of Elizabeth, younger
daughter of the W. M. Bells, of Meekri
station, Camperdown, and John Taylor
Thornton, of Mt. Myrtoon’s broad acres,
took place at St. Paul’s, Camperdown.
The bride, who had no ’maids, wore a
French blue Angora cloth suit with a
beret toque of grey. Only a few rela-
tives were gathered at luncheon after-
wards. The bridegroom is eldest son of
the late J. H. Thornton and of Mrs.
Thornton, of Mt. Myrtoon and Toorak.
The engagement is announced of Eliza-
beth (otherwise Betty), second daughter
of the Leslie M. Macphersons, Toorak,
and Reginald, only son of the late Lieu-
tenant-Colonel and Mrs. Reginald Clarke
and a grandson of baronet William
Clajke, of Rupertswood. The prospec-
tive bridegroom is squire of Koraleigh
station, Tongala.
Peggy King (now Mrs. Harry Oli-
phant) was guest of honor at a series of
tea-drinkings on the eve of her marriage.
Phyllis Mein, who was one of the atten-,
dant ’maids, put on a party at which
gifts for the kitchen were showered on
the soon-to-be-wed.
After nine years in Melbourne, Prof.
F. C. Wilkinson, Dean of the Faculty
of Dental Science at the Uni., and his
wife are returning to England. Good-bye
was said to Mrs. Wilkinson at a private
dinner at the Lyceum Club by the
womenfolk of the prof.’s colleagues. Mrs.
W. E. Agar came to the function in a
gown of filmy black lace ; Mrs. Wilkin-
son chose sunset-pink lace draperies. A
picture by a local artist was a parting gift
to the prof, from the guests.
There was a pyjama tea-party at the
home of Mrs. J. G. Latham, Malvern,
the other day in the interests of St.
George’s Hospital. Materials of all
natures had been made into sleeping-
suits, to be sold for the cause, and these
were displayed by amateur mannequins.
The 200 guests bought the whole stock,
which included some beach wear. Mrs.
Latham is president of a committee
which is staging a fete for the needy insti-
tution in a couple of months’ time.
Here is a Lafayette picture of Etta
Bernard, a Melbourne girl whose expres-
sive contralto voice is often heard on the
concert platform and in oratorio. En-
couraged by praise from critics and from
listeners-in, the lass has decided to go
to Europe for further training and ex-
perience early next year. She,has won
championship honors at South-street, and
is an L.A.B. Recently she was the bene-
ficiary of a complimentary concert at
Essendon.
Many former students of the P.L.C.
assembled at the Old Collegians’ Club
to pay a tribute to Emily Virtue, who
has retired after long association with the
school. Miss Virtue has for the last few
weeks been on a visit to friends in West-
ralia, so a welcome back to Melbourne
was attached to the party in her honor.
The president of the Old Collegians’
Association, Kathleen Stobie, made a
speech and presented Miss Virtue with
a pair of silver entree dishes, the gift of
old pupils and other friends.
The sudden death of the wife of knight
George Tallis brought back memories of
the days when she and her sister,
Florence Young, were favorites of musi-
cal comedy. The Tallis lady was a great
charity worker and had an exceptionally
wide circle of friends. Some time ago
the Tallis family transferred their home
from Grosvenor, Toorak, now a rendez-
vous for smart weddings and social func-
tions, to their property at Mornington,
next door to Frankston. At present
knight George and his son John are in
London on theatrical business. There
are two other sons and slim, dark-haired,
dark-eyed daughter Biddy.
Mrs. Victor Wischer, wife of one of
the city’s legal lights and an enthusiastic
worker for musical organisations, has
now been pressed into the service of the
District Nursing Society and the Free
Kindergarten Union. The lady, whose
picture by Broothorn is presented here,
was leader of a pioneer chamber-music
quartette of her sex in this city. She
has long been connected with the Lady
Northcote Trust of the Uni. Symphony
Orchestra —now incorporated in the Mel-
bourne Symphony Orchestra —and is a
pillar of the British Music Society. Also,
she is convener of the Lyceum Club’s
music circle. Mrs. Wischer’s sister, Dora
Meeson-Coates, has made a niche for
herself in London as a painter.
The billy was boiled at the Toorak
home of Mrs. E. Talbot Hamilton to
give greeting to Alice Creswick and
Hazel Martin on their return from a holi-
day spent in China and Japan.
Dr. Edward L. Gault has received word
that his daughter, Dr. Adelaide Gault,
who is specialising in diseases of the eye.
has qualified in London for the Diploma
of Opthalmology. The young lady, who
is a graduate of Melbourne Uni., had
five years’ service with a medical mission
in India.
Perth’s social whirl: —
R. Mattiske, J. M. Sutcliffe and B. R. Fitz-
hardinge engineered the Bankers’ Ball. Manager
Wreford and liis wife were there, and Mr. and
Mrs. Anthony Robertson, she with a lame cloak
over her black Chantilly laces. Alice Biggs
matched her eyes with nut-brown taffetas;
Lily Stoneman’s gold lace harmonised with her
hair; pink-sprigged black taffetas became Jean
Lang’s lissome lines; Marjorie Butler’s glit-
tering gold sequins took the eye; Sylvia Cox
was set about with eau-de-nil lace; Mrs. Love’s
white velvet cape surmounted a black gown;
Sheila McClemens made a happy choice in
almond-blossom chiffons, and Miss Fitzhardinge
in mermaid-green lace.
The English Public Schools Association gave
its badge—the Cross of St. George and a lion
—the place of honor on the wall of the Savoy
ballroom when it held its dance. Chairman
Norbert Keenan, with Mrs. Hubert Parker, a
graceful figure in beach-sand chiffons, did the
welcoming amidst gum-leaves and flags. Mrs.
Frank Leake trod a measure in grass-green
satin; Mrs. de Witt’s drapings were black lace
and georgette; Mrs. H. J. Minors smiled in
parrot-blue crinkly crepe; Mabel Balding’s
dashing silver lame was slashed with black
velvet; regal white satin looked well on Mrs. L.
F. O’Connor; Molly Taylor’s moss-green
taffetas were bebowed, and Vans Anderson’s
marocains were red-and-white striped. The
three Padbury sisters, Marion, Mary and Dickie,
were there, and Dr. Quinlan and his bride.
For the Hunt Club week-end at Moora, hotels
and homes were overflowing with visitors, and
the showgrounds stabled scores of horses and
beagles sent up from Perth. At the dinner
J. J. Poynton and his spouse were hosts, with
assistance from the J. P. Duracks; and there
was a cinema show and dancing. Premier
Phil Collier and his son went along, and so did
George Gwynne, Tom Draper, Stan O’Brien,
Sheila Hayes and the Smily sisters. The clans
Lee Steere and Lefroy and Dr. and Mrs. Miles
were among the local representatives.
Cynthia Dunman trailed ivory satin and a
Limerick lace veil as she paced the aisle of St.
George’s Cathedral to exchange vows with Dr.
Tim Godlee, son of the Theodore Godlees, of
Adelaide. Archdeacon Riley tied the knot and
the Bishop of the North-West gave the blessing.
Sister Maud Dunman, in maize georgette, with
tulle headpiece to match, and Dr. Muecke
signed the register. After-rejoicings were at the
Palace Hotel, where Mr. and Mrs. Dunman,
she in black lace with feathered velvet coatee,
greeted the guests.
Mrs. Sarah Elizabeth McCarthy is no more.
In spite of her 80 years and silver hair, until
a short time before her death Mrs. McCarthy
was a familiar figure at all charitable balls, and
was among the dancers.
After a fleeting visit to her home town, Bun-
bury, to play first ’maid at the Nash-Verscheur
wedding, Maxine Joel flew back to Melbourne
to prepare for her own nuptials with Rupert
Levi.
Back from a year’s trip to Singapore, China,
Japan and M.L. are those inveterate travellers
Mrs. Richard Hardy and daughter Gretchen.
A voyage to England is now in prospect.
Adelaide doings:
At Myer’s Ball in the Palais Royal in aid
of the Children’s Hospital, there were over 900
present. A huge Spanish galleon sailed on to
the centre of the ballroom, when a ballet of 50
girls, garbed as pirates and armed with cut-
lasses, descended to the floor and danced. Mr.
and Mrs. Norman Myer entertained a party of
friends in their box. Mrs. Myer wore a modish
frock of taffeta, an autumnal tartan on a
cream ground.
The Women’s Hockey Association enter-
tained visiting teams at the South Australian.
The guests were received by Dorothy Somer-
ville and Mis. A. H. Cashmore. Before leav-
ing Adelaide the visitors clubbed together and
sent a beautiful luminous clock to Mrs. A. H.
Gault, president of the association, who is ill
in hospital. A clock was also presented to Miss
N. Magarcy, the secretary.
Mrs. Arthur Rymill gave a party at (he
Queen Adelaide Club in honor of her daughter.
Mrs. Tom Giblin, of Hobart.
Tire Norman Myers have purchased The
Myrtles, at Medindie, latterly the home of Mr.
and Mrs. F. Verco. It was built by the
Hawkers in the old days, and its rooms are
spacious and its grounds extensive.
Dr. and Mrs. T. Knowles, of England, after
a visit to relatives in Adelaide, left with Dr. and
Mrs. C. H. Nicol, of Waikerie (S.A.), on a
motor tour which will take them through Mel-
bourne, Canberra and Sydney to Queensland.
The Speck welcomes its new Governor
and his wife:
They arrived in bright sunshine. A big crowd
gathered on the wharf, and there was a guard
of honor. The levee which followed was well
attended. Sir Ernest Clark made a good im-
pression by his speech in answer to this wel-
come, and his lady, with her pleasant face and
manner and quiet dressing, is just the figure to
fit the “Victorian boudoir” which has kept its
character in the old v.-r. home.
The Uni. Ball at the Continental was a jolly
affair. The committee, comprising Brenda Old-
meadow, Judith Gould, Norman Westbrook
and R. Clive, with Donald Webster as hon.
sec., knew its job and did it well. The official
party included Chancellor Stops and his wife,
the Vice-Chancellor and Mrs. Morris Miller,
Prof, and Mrs. Alan Burn, Prof, and Mrs.
Pitman, Dr. A. L. McAulay, Mr. and Mrs.
K. Dallas, Mr. and Mrs. H. S. Baker, the
Registrar and Mrs. Preshaw, Mr. and Mrs.
Field, Mrs. Tom Murdoch and Miss Lowen-
stern. Decorations of japonica made the
supper-tables gay and the mirth of most of
the dancers was a decoration in itself.
Queen Alexandra Hospital committee ran
two big bridge parties in the afternoon and
evening of the same day, and netted a consid-
erable sum. Mrs. D. C. McLaren was organiser.
The rooms, warmed by big wood-fires, were
decked with spring blossoms.
Scotch College Ball (Launceston) v/as opened
appropriately by the Pipers’ Band in full blast,
marching at the head of the grand parade down
the Albert Hall, which was titivated with St.
Andrew’s crosses and the Scottish lion. The
guests represented three generations.
The Philharmonic Society gave a concert in
the Town Hall, with Brahms’s “Star of Des-
tiny” and a first performance in Tas. of
Mozart’s Symphony in C Major as the main
items. The Phil, is a progressive little organi-
sation, , and Mrs. Alan Mclntyre, its president,
keeps it very much alive.

"Now we both

“First down to the garage drives the

now that we own a “ Vauxhall” with
Synchro-Mesh easy gear change, it’s a
genuine pleasure to drive, even in the
thickest traffic or on the worst roads. 1
never was a master at the old-fashioned
double declutching, but now that does not
matter —Synchro-Mesh has made me as
good at gear-changing as the most expert
driver. It just means slipping the gear
lever from silent second gear to top or
back again at any speed, and there’s
no trouble and no noise. Vauxhall’s
Synchro-Mesh is certainly the most
valuable advancement. I have experi-
enced in motor cars for years.”
The magic of Vauxhall’s Synchro-Mesh, the
easy gear change, has enthused men and women
everywhere. With it even the veriest amateur
can change gears without clashing.
Other features which prove the worth of
Vauxhall’s popularity are the economical, yet
powerful engine, the finger-tip steering, the
smooth, positive brakes, the roomy and delight-
fully appointed interior and the distinctive
Vauxhall coachwork which reflects the tradi-
tional breeding of this fine English car. You
cannot experience the acme in motor car
comfort and performance until you drive a

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
“Mosaique”: The current craze for
jigsaw puzzles leads one to wonder why
the educational authorities do not turn
it to advantage. In the epidemic of the
early ’eighties writer had a puzzle made
from a map of England and Wales. To
this day he can recall the position of every
county in the kingdom and principality,
and draw the shape of each from mem-
ory, if necessary.

“Erua”: After a Maoriland Govern-
ment had suffered from a riot of unkind
criticism over one particular penny
stamp, it received unexpected solace.
The head of King George was the point
of the argument, and roundly Dominion
art experts condemned it. Then the phila-
telic magazines of England came to hand,
full of praise for that stamp. It silenced
local argument entirely, particularly as
one publication hailed it as the best re-
presentation of tfc,e sovereign ever printed _
on a stamp, and called on all the other :
dominions, colonies and so forth to note
and follow M.L.’s example.

“Cash Amateur”: Any hope that may
have been entertained of bringing Helen
Wills-Moody and Suzanne Lenglen to-
gether has been dashed by Helen her-
self. It was put to the American that
if she would forfeit her status to meet
the Frenchwoman a series of matches
with big money attaching would be put
up for the pair. Helen replied that, un-
like her famous countryman who charged
five dollars for a sandwich, she didn’t
need the money, and that in any case she
did not desire to play with professionals.

“Blue Chalk”: As most expected, the
English Billiards Control Board has de-
cided that the 200 points baulkline rule
which was experimented with in the big
matches last season shall become a regu-
lar feature of competition billiards from
September 1. It will apply to profes-
sionals only, of course, for the spectacle of
the average amateur having to break off
a run of 200 in order to take play over
the baulkline is as rare as truth in a
politician. Melbourne Inman, now
showing in Maoriland, and Horace Lin-
drum, who trips to Britain with him, will
just be home in time to welcome in
the new rule.

“Third Base”: Australian baseballers
are reviving the idea of a visit from a
team of American professionals which
has been raised and laid to sleep on
several occasions, expense being the
hurdle. The last pros, to come here were
the New York Giants and the Chicago
White Socks. That was in 1914, when
the teams were doing an exhibition tour
of the world. Since then, we have enter-
tained an amateur side from Leland-
Stanford University, which proved far
too good for anything in this country.
It is hoped that the Philadelphia Players
will make the trip in September, when,
with football finished and cricket not
into its stride, there will be a chance of
getting grounds and gates.
“Tiki”: The M.L. Dept, of Agricul-
ture has recently been bombarded with
queries as to the possibilities of citrus-
fruit-growing. Whether it is likely to be
profitable on a large scale hasn’t been
tested, but there is no doubt about the
ability of the orange-tree to acclimatise
itself in the far-northern end of the
Dominion. On August 10, 1818, an
orange-tree was planted by Mrs. James
Kemp, a member of Samuel Marsden s
mission, at Keri Keri, North Auckland.
It has been bearing goodly crops of fruit
for over a century, and gave a goodly
return this year. In July it was uprooted
by a gale, but it has been replanted, and
seems to be likely to strike root again.
The tree is in the garden of the home
of the Misses Kemp, descendants of the
original planter, and their house is the
oldest wooden dwelling in the Dominion.
In the garden is a pear-tree, brought from
Sydney as a sapling 110 years ago. It
is now 60ft. high with a very wide spread.

“Bloggs”: Germany’s proposal to
sterilise “persons hereditarily tainted or
suffering from transmissible diseases or
chronic alcoholism” reads like one of
those sure-fire quack remedies that first
buck the patient up and then make him
feel worse than ever. In “Degeneration”
Max Nordau proved that a large pro-
portion of great men were physical or
moral degenerates. The second Pitt
was an alcoholic, Byron was mal-
formed, Keats, Chopin and others were
consumptive, Mahomet and many more
great leaders were epileptics. Are such
men to be debarred from transmitting
their good qualities to posterity because
they have some bad ones? Degenera-
tion, further, is strictly relative, By the
time a generation or so of t.b. subjects,
syphilitics and epileptics have been
weeded out, the physical (not the mental)
standard of the community should be
improving fast. But a vested interest in
the business of sterilisation will have
long since come into being; sufferers
from incurable nasal catarrh or chronic
tanninism will be smelt out by the steril-
isers and compulsorily treated. The end
of the chapter is likely to be the crea-
tion of a small race of beautiful, brain-
less creatures who will be either wiped
out or reduced to subjection by a teem-
ing nation of reckless, resourceful ad-
venturers who have assimilated every
known disease into their systems, as our
ancestors did the Black Death,

“Der Jong”: That African honey-
guide fowl isn’t all he is cracked up to
be (B. 9/8/’33). I was transport riding
once with a Scotchman on the Crocodile
River in the Bushveld who was a perfect
nuisance by reason of his thirst for
honey, which he converted into a para-
lysing form of dop. One evening when
it was his turn to see to the boys making
a scherm round the waggon he suddenly
rushed olf after a honey-finder which was
hanging round. Ten minutes later he
came back at a gallop, clothes scratched
off by the wacht-ein-bitje, dripping with
water, and with his head swollen to the
size of a warthog’s. The bird had led
him to a tree hive, but only when he
had knocked it down did he find it was
full of the big two-inch black swarteufel
hornets of those parts. He had chanced
the crocodiles and gone into the river
to get rid of them. It didn’t ease his
feelings either when 1 told him that, it
there was one thing a honey-finder liked
better than honey, it was nice, fat wasp
grubs.

“General Prac.”: Hitler’s habit of per-
secuting Jewish professional men (doc-
tors amongst others) is already having its
repercussions in he Llttle Entente_coun
tries. In Transylvania and
where medical culture has always been
of German origin, there is a ™n-si Z e d
boycott of German drugs textbooks
In Roumama there is less need to boycott
them, for Roumanian doctors already
read French medical literature and pie-
scribe French medicines.
south-eastern Europe is flooded with leaf-
lets detailing suitable substitutes for Ger-
man preparations. For instance, neosal-
varsan (German), the great remedy for
syphilis, has given way to novarsenobu-
lon (French); antipyrine, used lor reduc-
ing fever and relieving neuralgia, has
vanished before cryogenin, equally eflec-
five, and made near Pans; uminal, a
German powder which controls epileptic
fits, has disappeared, and the brench
drug alepsol has taken its place. I could
quote a dozen more such examples. I’ll
bet there are sore heads in such fine
firms as Mercks, of Darmstadt, and
'Scherings, near Berlin.


When Other Lips . . .
BY WALTER E. WYNNE.
TEN per cent, of men experience love ;
85 per cent, experience marriage ;
95 per cent., at least once in a life-
time, endure the ordeal of getting the
sack. In its inevitableness it is second
only to death.
We heard one morning that a derrick
had broken on the Lotus South, and
that a suspended boiler had crashed to
earth, killing a rigger. They rushed me
out to cover it. On arrival I found that
a derrick had indeed broken and dropped
a hoisted boiler. More, a rigger had
been standing within ten feet of the spot
15 minutes before the descent. But the
incident hadn’t affected the Lotus South
to any marked extent, though something
had. Everyone seemed preoccupied and
nervous. Men were working with un-
usual speed.
I browsed around to seek the cause
of this activity. There might be a par.
in it. Near the scene of the narrowly-
averted disaster I captured a greaser, fear-
fully busy with grease-cans and cotton-
waste.
“What’s the trouble?” I inquired.
“Everybody has his nose down to it and
looks as skittish as a rabbit by moon-
light. Why all the fuss?”
He glanced quickly about before an-
swering me. “Chap’s just got the sack
round here,” he replied, speaking through
a corner of his mouth like a convict on
parade.
“Discharged?”
“Yairs, sacked on the spot. General
manja came along and found him a bit
dizzy-like, with his head in his hands, and
fired him for sleeping on the job. Sleep-
ing! Most likely he just felt faint, same
as you get on any job, and went out to
it for a minute. And the mong fired
him!”
Poignantly the recollection came to me
of many such dizzy turns when in front
of my work. Perhaps it was this that
raised ,my interest from the merely
casual. It was easy to visualise the scene.
A poor toiler grown faint with long
hours and hope deferred swooning
momentarily over his work. Advent of
general manager—how clearly I pictured
him —a bully, without a particle of
humane feeling ; the coarse, overbearing
voice of authority dismissing the humble
wage-slave.
From contemplation of this age-old
drama I turned for further details to the
greaser. But he was far away, intent on
his work. Nevertheless, I did not de-
spair of being able to gather data. Just
as women in their idleness discuss births
and deaths, so do workers in their in-
dustry wrangle on hiring and firing.
My next witness was a typical Bill
Bowyangs, patched dungarees and worn
shovel complete, scraping energetically
at a pile of rubble.
“They tell me that poor old what’s-
his-name has been sacked,” I said to him
with a world of indignation in my voice.
He straightened up with a furtive look
round, and rested his shovel against a
wall.
“Bunny sacked?” he snorted. “It’s a
lie! He chucked the job up. Squatted
down to tie his boot or something, and
just as he was doing it the manja came
along and says, ‘We like to see our men
standing up to their work here, son.’
What could Bunny say? He says, ‘Well,
you can go to hell, you half-caste nigger
overseer, and take the lousy job with
you. Gimme me time!’
“Then the manja wanted to reneg. He
says, ‘Not so fast, old chap ; I didn’t
mean’ But Bunny shouts him down.
‘Don’t try any of your rotten palaver
with me,’ Bunny says; ‘l’m through. I
wouldn’t work under a lizard like you
for another minute for anything on
earth! Gimme me time.’ And he walks
off the job, leaving the manja dazed.”
“And didn’t the manager say any-
thing?” I asked in surprise.
“Say anything— -to Bunny? He hadn’t
the nerve! Bunny would ’a’ wiped the
lease with him. I thought he was going
to pass the manja one, but he didn’t. A
genelman, Bunny is—a reel genelman.”
With greater clarity I was informed
of the salient points of the manager’s
character. As is so often the case,
he had been pitchforked into the posi-
tion, a skunk without sufficient strength
of character to rule the men under him,
without a semblance of tact to smooth
over the grievances that result sometimes
in mild disputes, sometimes in strikes.
“These brass-hats are all the same,”
continued my informant, preparing to
roll a cigarette. “Stand up to them and
call their bluff, and they’re done. I re-
member when he first came he tried to
fire me. Me, mindja! I faces him and
says sarcastic”——
In one convulsive leap he retrieved his
shovel and filled the air with small stones
by the violence of his exertion. Out of
the dust came his voice, “Look out, cob-
ber, he’s coming! Better mizzle! That s
his car up the road there.”
Some quarter-mile away a shiny car
was approaching. Thoughtfully I moved
on. A carter was trying to elicit signs
of life from a huge dray-horse. The
animal stood on rigid outspread legs and
stolidly eyed the ground between its fore-
feet. With infinite patience the carter
jerked the bridle, smote the rump and
whipped its ribs. Then in a voice devoid
of malice he ejaculated “Oh, you”
and hacked it hard on the shin. Un-
moved, the horse continued its inspection
of the ground.
“You ought to sack him,” I said viva-
ciously. “Send him up to the office to
get his time.”
“It would pay them a sight better to
sack these horses than to sack their con-
shenshus workers,” he answered with
bitterness ; and I exulted. For of all the
democrats to be found on a mine the
carter working on contract is indepen-
dent and supreme. Comprising in one
unit all the finest qualities of bullockies,
drovers, stockmen and teamsters, he is
immeasurably above the general man-
ager, hopelessly below the assay-office
brat. Nobody can claim his favor or
his allegiance.
“I suppose you saw poor old Bunny
getting sacked,” I prompted.
“Wasn’t much to see,” he grunted.
“But there was plenty to hear. They
could talk all right, those two. I’ll tell
you about it.”
“Manja came up and saw Bunny leaning
against a post and said [unhappily the
following is an abridged version], ‘Slip
into your —— work, and don’t bear
against that so-and-so post, you natural
child.’ Bunny said, ‘Who the name do
you think you’re talking to, you such-
and-such noun?’ Manja said, ‘Why, you
unmentionable, do you imagine you can
thus-and-thus talk to me like that-and-
that, and adjectivally get away with it?
You’re fired, by name, name, name. Get
off the highly picturesque lease, verb
you!’ And Bunny said, ‘l’m going, curse
you, and glad to get away from this de-
scriptive mine.’ Then Bunny put on his
coat and walked off, and when he got a
bit away he remembered and yelled back
to the manja, ‘You’ ”
The hitherto immovable horse had
backed its dray into a motor-truck, and
over the interlocked wheels there arose
a passionate rhetoric from carter and
driver that was horrible to hear. Sadly
I departed, reflecting that, after all, these
were members of the exploited class.
They had had no college education
to enlighten and refine them. But
to think of a man in an exalted adminis-
trative position like the general manager
stooping to exchange such profanity with
his employees and discharging one!
Close by was a sort of sentry-box
arrangement, which proved to be a fore-
man’s office. From this quarter I ex-
pected a thoroughly trustworthy account.
Suspended as he is somewhere between
staff eminence and minimum basic-wage
obscurity, the foreman usually gets a
broader view of what is going on. As
go-between he has cautiously to sub-edit
commands from above and complaints
from below.
I found him scribbling violently
amongst a mess of files and forms and
tickets. My apologetic cough caused the
fever to abate largely, and he looked up
with his face relaxing from its official
rigidity. It looked to me, too, as though
he sighed with relief.
“So poor old Bunny’s gone?” I re-
marked as a safe opening.
“Yes, the fool!” he said. “He’s been
warned again and again about loafing
on the job, and it’s come at last.”
“Was there much fuss about it?”
“Oh no. The manja just sacked him.
He was working right across there —see
that chap now?” I saw Bunny’s succes-
sor making the fur fly on Bunny’s vacated
job. “The manja came up and found
him sitting back half-asleep, and said
‘Go to the office and get your time.’
Bunny said, ‘But I’ The manja
said loud, ‘Go on!’ and Bunny went.
Oh, no fuss at all. The manja is a
gentleman, and he’d warned Bunny often
enough. I saw Bunny crawling down to
the change-room.’ ”
It was patent now that only two per-
sons were in possession of the actual
facts of the case. Bunny, having been
sacked, might take some finding; but
Bunny could wait. The general manager
was about the mine. Him I would see.
After many directions and redirections
I found the g.m. He was scraping a
splash of black grease from his white
duck sleeve with a sharp stick.
“I suppose,” I said, “that with so many
men under your control it’s neither here
nor there when you have to discharge
on ® ? ’’ J . 4(Ti ,

“Bunny? Bunny?” said the puzzled
manager, absently wiping the sharp stick
on a spotless expanse of white duck.
“There’s a rabbit-faced young fellow they
call ‘Bunny,’ and I had to warn him only
this morning about sleeping on the job.”
“He wasn’t sacked, you say?”
“Good heavens, no! I took him from
that quiet job, which is apt to send a
chap like him to sleep, down to the
crushers, where the Seven Sleepers
couldn’t get a wink for the row. He’ll
have to keep his wits about him down
there.”
“But I heard he’d been sacked.”
a ghastly thought appeared to upset
him.
“Impossible,” he mused. “I say, if

The Deserter.
BY J. H. M. ABBOTT.
THE corporal of the guard at the bar-
rack gates in George-street returned
(o the guard-room dripping wet,
- , . , T
altei marching the rebels through torren-
tial rains that had been pouring down
into the soaked highways and byways of
Sydney ever since First Post had sounded
at nine o’clock.
It was midnight now, and the beat and
hiss of the pounding waters on the
shingles overhead, and against the small-
parted windows of the one-storey build-
ing, had for three hours maintained a
steady tattoo that could hardly be com-
pared to anything else than the long-
maintained roll of kettledrums. As he
peeled off his wet overcoat, Corporal
Target spat disgustedly in the smoking
fire, half-smothered m the iron grate by
the drip that came down the chimney.
“Gawd! ’ he said. I never knoo sich
a night not in all me born days. W ere s
th sergeant, Jimmy Smale at s be-
come o’ Stnpey? As e looked hout an
bin drownded ?
The old soldier crouching on a three-
legged stool beside the fireplace took his
black clay pipe from between his broken
teeth, and gaped up at the corporal with
a cunning leer in his twisted countenance.
His shoulders shook as with suppressed
merriment, and presently his battered
features resolved themselves into an un-
mistakable grin as he favored the non-
commissioned officer with a cunning
“Corpril,” he replied wheezily, “if ye
were to ask me anythink abart it, I’d
give it as me opinion as ’ow Sergeant
Merriman as cut % lucky.”
•■•Ow d’ye mean, cut ’is lucky? 'E
ain’t supposed to leave th’ strokin' guard-
room. 'As ’e been gorn long?”
“Any o’ these fellies,” replied Jimmy,
indicating with a wave of his arm the re-
cumbent huddled figures of the nine men
lying on the raised plank staging of the
guard-bed in the discomfort of ful equ p-
merit—“all these ’ere coveys, they’d tell
ye th’ same, Corpril. The sergeant’s
’ooked it, ’E’s gorn.”
“You mean ’e’s desarted?” said the
corporal, with something of fearfulness
in his voice.
“Ah.”
“Well, good luck to ’im,” growled Mr.
Target. “ ’Tis a proper night for to do
it. Soldierin’ a night like this—enough
to mike th’ ’ole reg’ment desart. A
dawg’s life, that’s wot it is. Gimme some
o’ that fire, Jimmy—l’m fair soaked.”
In the meantime, Sergeant Tobias Mer-
riman, of H.M. 4th Regiment of Foot
(The King’s Own), was groping his dark
and uncomfortable way along Kent-street.
The bellowing wet wind whipped up a
muddy spray from the river-bed the high-
way had become into his face. Once or
twice he halted and peered into the black-
ness before him, his bent right forearm
touching the peak of his shako. “The
blasted trull,” he said, gasping for breath
—“she’s not worth it! But I’ll kill her!”
Towards the southern end of the street,
which lost itself in a scrubby no-man’s-
land lying between the Brickfields and the
head of Cockle Bay (Darling Harbor), he
came to a standstill at a small cottage
standing behind its garden in a paling-
fenced allotment Only a little runlet —
now a rushing torrent-—tearing down on
its further side had indicated to him, in
the black opacity of the wild night the
position of the house. He stared at a
dimly-lighted window before demanding
admission, muttering savagely to himself,
After gazing at the yellow glow for a few
moments from the side of the muddy
highway, he passed through the gate into
the garden, squelched up the central path-
way, and hammered on the door,
jj e strained his ears for sounds of
moV ement inside, but the roar of the
pe ]ting rain drowned all the other noises
j n anc i on ]y could he depend
on b i s e y es Presently they informed
b i m tbat tbe jjg bt j n tbe room —his s e( j.
room — was being moved, and in a
rnoment or two the yellow oblong of
window became part of the black-
ness. A perpendicular slit of light sud-
jenly appeared by his left shoulder as
t he door was opened slightly. He threw
his weight against it, and fell into the
house.
j n t h e middle Q f the room, as
he hoisted himself on to his k and
then stood erect he saw his wife in her
ni ht dress, holding a candle above the
of her llo * h air. with startled ,

Tie her shoulder, and put his
hand under his dripping cloak, producing
a crumpled and soiled twist of paper,
which he carefully unfolded. “I got this
to-night. ’Twas throwed on the verandah
of the guard-room, and is addressed to
me. Nice sort o’ thing for a man to get,
ain’t it? Take it and read it.”
With trembling hands, she held the
damp piece of paper close to the candle-
light and read:
“There is no fool like a blind fool.
Leave your duty to-night, and go home,
no matter what happens, and you will be
wett rewarded. So will Major Trehearne.

The angry man wheeled about, and,
despite everything, came to attention and
saluted the tall and saturnine man who
grinned abominably in the doorway of
the other room. A century ago, the
discipline of a British regiment of the
line was still as overpowering as the
Iron Duke had made it.
The second-in-command of The King’s
Own had a face that was the double of
that of King Charles the Frivolous —
even to the little absurd moustache. All
that took away from the perfection of
the likeness was the absence of the great
curled periwig and the close-cropped
black hair surmounting the swarthy head-
piece. There was humor in the face —
and something else that checked the out-
raged man, standing stiffly in the com-
pelling presence of its owner.
“You are on duty, Sergeant Merri-
man?” said the officer. “You are in
charge of the guard at the barrack gates,
1 think?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Then why are you here?”
The cool impudence was too much for
the sergeant. He slackened his pose of
bolt-upright rigidity, and stood bending
forward with clenched fists, glaring at
the other, who returned his stare with
a little mocking smile playing about his
sensual mouth.
“By God!” the sergeant cried. “You
dare to stand there, half-dressed, in my
house, and ask me why I’m here! You
do that, you d d villain!”
Instantly the major’s smile vanished
and the purr in his voice gave place to
the harsh croak of the parade-ground
martinet.
“ Attention!” he cried. “Sergeant Mer-
riman, you forget yourself. Stand to
attention when you address an officer.”
Against his will, the sergeant again
saluted, and brought his athletic body
once more into stiff formality.
“Yes, sir,” he said, with a catch in his
voice.
For a few moments Major Trehearne
eyed him sternly. Then he relaxed again,
and the cruel smile came back.
“You are aware, of course, Sergeant,”
■ he said, “of the serious nature of your
dereliction of duty. Reduction to the
ranks would be the very least you
could look for at the hands of the
colonel, were your lapse to be made
known to him. Probably it would be
more than that. But though I really can
have no sympathy with a non-commis-
sioned officer who has committed such
a fault as yours, I will admit that the
letter you received gives you some
measure of excuse —entirely inadmissible
in your defence, of course. That is to
say, your defence before a court-martial.
With me it is different. As a man”
“As a man !” exclaimed Sergeant Mer-
riman bitterly. “I’m no man to be
a-standin’ here as I am. If I was to”
“Silence!” barked the other. “You
forget yourself, Sergeant. Listen to me.
As I was passing out of the barrack
gates, two hours ago, you were ordered
by me to wait in the gateway for the
colonel, and to send a messenger im-
mediately to my quarters to acquaint
me with his arrival after an absence all
day at Parramatta. You understand?
You will return with me now to the bar-
racks and take up your position there.
The colonel will not return until two
o’clock. Just wait a moment, until I am
dressed. Remain at attention, and do
not interfere with this lady. You under-
stand?”
“yes, sir.”
The major withdrew, and .Sergeant
Merriman remained rooted to the floor,
facing the bedroom door. In the back-
ground, his wife crouched down on a
stool, her splendid golden hair falling
loose about her shoulders, and her face
hidden in her hands. Tn less than a
minute, booted and cloaked, Major Tre-
hearne reappeared in the doorway. The
rain roared dully down on the shingled
roof of the little house.
“Come!” said the major, pointing to
the front door with the riding-crop he
carried in his right hand. The sergeant
stepped forward, and opened it. A tear-
ing gust of wind blew out the candle.
As they went out into the raging tem-
pest the woman wailed, and they could
hear the soft thud of her body as she
fell in a heap, fainting, on the boards.
The major pulled the door to.
“To the barracks!” he shouted above
the bellowing of the e^ments.
* * * *
For many years the south-east corner
of Kent and King streets was known in
Sydney as “Murderer’s Corner.”
There it was that Major Trehearne’s
body was found by a constable in the wet
dawn of the following morning.
Beside him lay a big military clasp-
knife, of the sort they issue to soldiers
to cut their rations.
But Sergeant Merriman was never
found.
His name was posted in the orderly
room, the name of a deserter.
In Hobart Town.
W. N. Graham writes:
’For many years I have read and enjoyed
J. H. M. Abbott’s stories in The Bulletin,
being specially interested in tales of The
System. In “Badajoz” (B. 12/7/’33) there is a
point—of no great importance to the narra-
tive —that I do not think can be historically
correct: the reference to Solomon Blay, the
hangman. Cadwallader, relating what happened
at Badajoz and after, says he threw up his
job of Under-Sheriff at Hobart Town m
1846; years previous to that “Solomon Blay, the
regular hangman, had drunk himself into
D.T.’s,” and to hang one of the ruffians of
Badajoz “it was necessary to secure a substi-
tute.”
Now, I was born at Hobart Town in 1867,
and grew up amid the legends and traditions
of The System. My father, born of free
settlers in the Spring Bay district, was a
general dealer, and when I was big enough to
accompany him he took me along with him
to the sales always—there was no compulsory
schooling in those days. G. S. Crouch had an
auction-room in Liverpool-street; next to it was
an unpretentious little pub kept by a Mrs.
Hearst. After the sale was over my dad and
a few choice spirits would foregather there,
and make merry over bread and cheese and
foaming Cascade beer, drunk out of pewter pots.
Solomon Blay was a frequent visitor to that
pub, and I knew him well. He was a tall,
gaunt fellow, with grizzled hair and beard; a
silent, morose man, even in liquor. Still he
took in good part any reference made to his
profession by boon companions. Now, that
was in 1876-77; so I question whether Sol
held the hangman’s job in ’46.
Martin Cash, the ex-bushranger, was often
one of the company. He was then a snowy-
haired genial old man who lived out Glen-
orchy way, and brought fowls and eggs to
market occasionally. Many a tale of old
Vandemonia I heard in that back parlor; tales
told by men who were at Port Arthur and
Maria Island; tales of the horrors they and
others had undergone at the hands of flagel-
lators. In after years, they said, some of those
flagellators had been tracked down, tied to
trees, stripped and given a liberal dose of the
lash they had so often inflicted on others.
Rough and coarse the ex-convicts of the
company were, but be it said they never pol-
luted a boy’s ear with smut. Only once m
my presence did I ever know an old lag to
blaspheme; and possibly he did not notice a
lad among the company. It was one afternoon
in the late ’seventies. I was then a sort ot
office boy for Harry Lord and R. P. Whit-
worth, a freelance journalist of the period.
Lord gave me a note for R.P.W. After looking
into some of their usual haunts I found Bob,
well oiled, at a place in Murray-street known
as The Hole in the Wall, a great resort of press-
men, lawyers and other kindred spirits. Balfe,
editor of the “Tribune” (there were two dailies
in Hobart Town then), was _ holding forth
against the Government—the big jovial fellow
was always agin the Government. A wonder-
ful speaker was Balfe.
Among the assembly were two English gentle-
men, newcomers visiting Tasmania. A hawker
came in: an old Port Arthur man, a lifer.
Balfe presented him to the visitors. One of the
Englishmen remarked that too much had been
made of the brutalities of The System, and
that it was incredible that men should
have been flogged to death, and all that sort of
thing.
“Then you don’t believe about how the
brutes flogged us,” said Jack Reville, the
hawker. “Look at this.” He pulled off h’s
clothes and stood bared to the waist.
He was a short, thick-set, powerful man. His
broad back was seamed and ridged with great
welts, crossed and recrossed. The flesh seemed
to be all the colors of the rainbow; not an
inch of white was visible. A sickening sight.
Then the old man cursed John Price and h.s
seed to the tenth generation.
When I was a boy Hobart Town was full
of quaint old pubs, with all sorts of fancy
names —and reputations. Jolly old taprooms
many of them were, with sawdust on the floor
and red curtains at the windows; and the fre-
quenters were just such people as Dickens used
to describe. Old fogeys dressed in long tight-
fitting frockcoats, high stocks and belltoppers,
grey and black, with snuff-boxes at the ready
when they stopped to speak to a crony; game-
keepers in velveteen coats, calfskin waistcoats
and gaiters; and now and then a person like
Bill Sikes. I used to wander about the water-
front where the old windjammers berthed and
the whalers came in. When the Commodore
and the fleet arrived, the port was full of man-
o’-war boats, and the pubs were full of tars
and marines in their red coats. Then the ola
town woke up.
It has been a wet afternoon in these South
Gippsland hills. There is a log-fire in tne
room, and I have been dreaming—dreaming
that I was a boy again, standing on the old dock
in Hobart Town, watching the mosquito fleet
come up the Derwent in the light of the setting
sun.
Ah well, time passes, and we its servants
; pass with it.

Peter Bordington, M.B. (Adel., 1923),
F.R.C.S. (Eng., 1928), reached out an
absent hand for the tin of cigarettes
lying on the American-leather-covered
table and sighed heavily. Damn the
creditors! Damn the debts! Haunting
him like leering ghosts of the past, ghosts
of the good old days. Haunting him
angrily until, with a small cheque here
and a small one there, he managed to
send therri back again to their restless
sleep for another month or two. Even
the whacking great feed of interest that he
periodically laid before them seemed to
provide very little solace for their woes.
A restless hand passed its spread
fingers through the brown hair, in which
a gentle powdering of silver told the tale
of anxiety long-continued, of an exacting
life lived at a little beyond the income.
The broad shoulders under the white
coat slumped dejectedly.
Seen against the sunset glow of the
window behind it, the face was one of a
not unpleasing ugliness, stamped with the
sign of a clear brain, of resolute charac-
ter. But it was aged beyond its three-
and-thirty years by the battle against
depression and despair waged by his
fatigued nervous system.
He crushed his cigarette in an ashtray
and cast the butt into a corner of the fire-
place. There it joined a dilapidated group
of its fellows, whose number indicated
the deplorable extent to which Peter
sought relief from his troubles in this
commonest of all the exhaustion-
neuroses. Reaching across to a pigeon-
hole of the shelf before him he took
down a long, grey folio. The frowning
features relaxed for a moment as he
turned the pages until he came to one
covered with a long series of names, and
opposite each name a figure in pounds,
shillings and pence. Neat system of book-
keeping he had evolved, he thought idly.
Simplicity itself, and foolproof.
What a mess his books had got into
six years ago on his first essay at private
practice! How many pounds he had
lost sight of in those two years! His
makeshift audit had shown £2OO on the
wrong side of the ledger. That was one
of the bad features of the medical cur-
riculum —the lack of any ordinary busi-
ness training. They taught you all about
treating disease and observing the ethics
and traditions, but they didn’t teach you
that G.P. was a business, and that your
bread and butter was going to depend
on the pounds and pence you got, not on
the racked bodies you calmed and made
whole again. Nor did they teach you
how to manage that business so that your
bread and butter would come fairly auto-
matically and leave your faculties un-
fettered for the task of doing your best
for your patients.
But he must pacify these creditors —
a feat which could only be performed by
the extraction of some return for ser-
vices rendered from the formidable list
of his debtors. It lay before him with the
ominous heading “Bad and Doubtful
Debts.” He smiled wryly as the thought
crossed his mind that these books of his
would hardly pass muster as “proper
books of account” in the eyes of a Judge
in bankruptcy. However....
He switched on the reading-lamp.
“Bad Debts”—yes, he supposed they
were; certainly he could see no way of
collecting them. Poor devils. It was like
kicking a sick dog to ask a man of
limited means to pay for the treatment
of an illness that had kept him without
wages for weeks. But needs must when
the financial devil drives ; and his own
wife and kids had to be fed and shel-
tered ; and he had to pay quickly enough
for the drugs and petrol he used, for his
car repairs and for misgovernment.
There was no benevolent Governmen-
tal protection for the P.8.G.P., he re-
flected a little bitterly. Not enough votes
in it.
Eight hundred, nine hundred, nearly
a thousand earned and not received, all in
the last three years. Gosh, what he could
do with that money if all the poor sud-
denly became affluent, and all the dis-
honest Were suddenly converted!
He could pay those debts and give his
wife that trip to Sydney and the Blue
Mountains which they had planned since
the days before the honeymoon. Start
the boy off in a decent school, instead
of sending him to the local place with
all the grubby-tongued township urchins
who, while annoying him intensely in
their healthy moments by their sheer un-
tamed animal ishness, became such lovable
little drains on his sympathetic vitality in
their hours of sickness. Get down to the
city and have a few weeks of really kindred
society. Take in the post-graduate course
as a stimulant to his rusty wits, dulled
by the lack of frequent and controversial
professional contact.
Jove, how he’d gather the boys around
and talk shop for hours on end! Give
them a dinner at the South and they
could all get a bit lit and have a merry
party, as in the good old student days.
Be a boy again for a while and get away
from this sickening burden of other
people’s cares and worries that he always
seemed to be carrying.
No wonder the profession as a class
suffered from blood-pressure. Anyway,
that was a decent way to die, as old Dad
Johnstone died last year—say good-
night to the wife after a rich evening
with friends, fall gently asleep, and pass
on into the great unknown without fore-
knowledge or pain.
However, there was little prospect of
the miracle of conversion or affluence
happening, and he still had to perform
one of his own ; and, though he knew the
list before him just about by heart, a
further study of it might supply some
inspiration.
Old George Lawson, eh? George had
made a big splash in the good days. A
cheque for £57 10s. would have been a
bagatelle to him before the slump came
in 1930. Since then two kids had had
their tonsils out, and one boy had got
tight and fallen off the motor-bike and
smashed up his leg. A nasty Pott’s frac-
ture it had been, and Peter had been
very bucked about the form and function
of the result. And then Mrs. George
had had periodical gallstone attacks,
always refusing to be operated on —said
it would be too expensive. Until she
did have her gall-bladder out she’d go
on costing Peter a deuce of a lot more
tearing to her rescue at break-spring
speed over those twenty miles of lime-
stone outcrop.
Now George was under the Relief Act.
He kept his big car working hard while
the boys rode about on motor-bikes
attending every party and turnout for
miles round. Hardly a fair thing, to say
the least of it. But, of course, there
were ways of dodging the inspectors, and
the Government didn’t get all the wheat.
A personal appeal might bring a few
quid. Same with a few others. But once
in his student days he'd heard some poor
devil of a G.P. labelled “The Begging
Doctor,” and to get that sobriquet applied
to him would be just about the end of
his self-respect. Even though there was
a depression a fellow had to keep intact
what shreds of pride were left to
him after six years of rural practice. In
the eyes of these country people a broke
doctor was a few degrees worse than a
drunk doctor.
Old Joe Higgins? Little hope in
that quarter. Joe had an irremov-
able but convenient delusion—the only
abiding relic of the cardiac dementia
that had given Peter so much worry
and so many disturbed nights—the
delusion that everyone was after his
money and he’d soon have none left.
Peter had Joe’s confidence now, but if
he mentioned his bill that confidence
would be gone, and with it probably the
old man’s frail hold on such sanity as
his depleted cerebral oxygen supply per-
mitted him. In the meantime £27 14s. 6d.
was held up until Joe died and the law-
yers had had their pickings from his
estate, after which time it (or such as was
left of it) could be thrown into the maw
of the hungry creditors. And it was Peter’s
duty to stave off the hand of Death
from that laboring myocardium; so
that for a couple of years more
Joe would periodically wake gasping for
breath, and, seizing any available article,
hurl it vigorously across the room at the
burglar or firebug of his disordered
imagination.
What a life that poor wife of Joe’s
must lead o’ nights! Some night he
would try to strangle her at his side. She
would take no warning, but continued
placidly at what she considered the point

“The
Intestinal
Tract
is the
most prolific
source of disease”
. . . states Famous German Doctor
Professor L. SCHMEIDLER
Coloseptic —the way to
keep internally clean.
The modern foods we eat, the stress of present-
day life combine to produce self-poisoning
(autoxima), the result of hidden and unsus-
pected constipation from which nine out of ten
suffer. Particles of food waste not properly
evacuated become encrusted in the intestine,
much as a water pipe becomes coated with
rust. This waste decays, harboring disease-
breeding germs and poisons. These are
absorbed into the system, thus polluting the
blood stream, undermining your health and
bringing on all manner of aches, pains and
sicknesses.
Simple Way to Health
Modern medicine has at its disposal a prepara-
tion with extraordinary health properties ....
COLOSEPTIC. It is a natural, simple way to
flush the poisons right out of the system. It is
unexcelled for combating chronic constipation.
HEADACHES, NERVES.
“Stanley St., Burwood, N.S.W.
“1 must say that since I have been using Coloseptic I
have never had any return of Headaches or Nerves, and
I have enjoyed the best of life, and I will always be only
too pleased to recommend it to others.

It invigorates the intestinal muscles. ... It
stimulates the flow of gastric juices and heightens
the appetite. . . . COLOSEPTIC completely
loosens off the waste and passes it smoothly out
of the body. It rids the blood of all impurities
through Nature’s other outlets—the kidneys—
the pores of the skin—and the respiratory
organs.
Drink Coloseptic
Are you suffering from constipation, headaches, weak-
ness, indigestion, gas in the stomach and bowels,
catarrh, backache, rheumatism, neuritis, eczema,
pimples? Drink COLOSEPTIC in hot water every
morning. Try it for at least seven days. It will “tone
up” your sluggish intestines. . . .soften accumulated
wastes. . . .keep your body internally active and
CLEAN. And when ■ the poisons no longer circulate
throughout your body, how much better you feel!

of greatest duty and of direst need. A
plain and very ordinary old woman —in
fact, rather unpleasant—but doing the
heroic thing and-thinking nothing of it.
Or was it that she was too darned obsti-
nate to break the habits of a lifetime?
And that other poor devil Dave
Hudson. Seven kids to look after and
Mrs. Hudson, worn out with too rapid
child-bearing, subject to desperate attacks
of tachycardia and syncope. Rush calls
at all hours in all kinds of weather.
Well he remembered that foggy night,
after heavy rain, when his car slid
all over a three-chain road and he
could only keep his direction by recog-
nising the trees he ran into. It took hi m
an hour to go seven miles. And then 112
found the woman perfectly well agai 1
and happy when he got there. Forty-
three, thirteen Hudson owed him. Allowed
to slide first year because times were
bad. Now sliding probably into per-
petuity because the promising crop had
been stricken with rust and had yielded
a bag of shrivelled wheat to the acre.
He’d had some exciting experiences in
fogs. There was that night when he had
run into a mob of horses. Luckily his
brakes had acted well and the tyres held
the dirt, but they kicked in a lamp
and a wing, and the door along-
side him had been stove in. Another
free job, too. That mad hound of a
Jackson, who had pickled himself on
White Lady and scared blazes out of
of his unfortunate wife —a debt not pro-
mising enough to stay even on the Bad
Debtors’ list for more than one year.
Then there was that night when he
looked across the broad fog-filled valley
under the light of the moon. The valley
was a vast lake, with little black islets
where occasional trees broke through the
surface, and far away at the further ridge
a black coastline. He drove slowly down
into that placid sea, and in the weird
submarine light, not four feet away, a
fox stood and watched him pass. The
moon was blue and green and yellow by
turns and surrounded, like Saturn, by
rings of all colors and sizes—purples
and blues and greens and browns, ex-
panding and contracting, changing in
color and iridescence as the car rose and
fell over the undulations of the valley
floor. Wonderful drive that. One of the
treasured memories of his rural experi-
ence.
John Rainbird, twenty guineas. Well,
he had taken the risk there with his eyes
open and lost on the gamble. John had
a pain in his side and went on cracking
stones for a few days on a diet of dysen-
tery drops. One stormy night the pain
suddenly took him like a knife-stab,
spread all over his abdomen and sent
his wife flying desperately round to the
surgery bell. They found him lying
in agony, with his stomach taut and
hard as a flooring-board ; a touch
sent him into a groan of anguish. Every
minute of delay meant danger, and to
transport him thirty miles to the nearest
Government hospital probably meant the
extinction of the faint spark of hope for
recovery that remained,
A quick decision, urgent telephonings,
a hurrying and scurrying at the little
private hospital, and at five a.m. John is
back between the sheets with three tubes
in his belly and a slender chance of con-
tinued existence. Then follows a week of
anxious fighting, of innumerable minute
observations of pulse and temperature,
leucocyte count, bacteriological smears,
careful studies of dressings, of the abdo-
minal battlefield, of the poisoned heart
and of the brown crusted tongue. A
week of delicate balancings of treat-
ment. Will this drug prove too much for
him? Will that?
Tubes and irrigations, hypodermics
and intramusculars, sera and a culture
for vaccines. At the end of a week im-
mediate danger is past, but at the end
of ten days the temperature starts to rise
again; in four more days a lump like
a cricket ball is felt. John’s appendix,
subsiding after its perforation and not
removed at his first operation on account
of the danger of disturbing Nature’s deli-
cate defensive processes and spreading
the peritonitis, has mortified, and John
has a residual abscess that must be
drained.
Once more the anaesthetist is called
twenty miles. Once more the operating-
theatre, the tubes ; this time John goes
along nicely, and, but for a mild bout
of pneumonia, is soon convalescent.
Meanwhile John’s wife is suffering in a
private and particular hell of her own ;
the anxiety for a loved one and thq
necessity of showing him a bright and
cheerful countenance in the face of his
sufferings drain her weak vital force, and
she comes to depend more and more
upon the doctor. He must bank down
the fires of her heTl with repeated encour-
agement and words of hope in the face
of his own conviction of disaster; he
must carry half of her burden, and her
anguished face haunts his restless dreams
and becomes a nightmare to him.
John came out of his illness with a
hospital bill for £25 and a new hold on
forty years of life. Peter came out ot
it £2O the poorer for anaesthetist’s tees,
bacteriologists’s fees, sera, medicines,
and with a further debit in the
account book of his nervous reserve.
John is unemployed, but happy and
well. Peter had had a gamble, a
choice of gambles: to gamble with
his money and treat John himself, or
to gamble with John’s life by sending
him on the rough and dangerous trip to
the Government hospital. To the detn-
ment of his creditors, his wife and kids,
Peter had chosen the honorable course,
Anyway, John had paid his hospital bill,
With a gesture of impatience, Peter
cast his cigarette into the fireplace. What
was the use? Not a hope of collecting a
shilling among the lot of them! Better
write to the creditors and tell them to
wait till harvest or go their hardest,
With something like a shiver, Dr. Peter
Bordington, M. 8., F.R.C.S., reached out
again for the cigarettes.
Railway Yards at Night.
Beneath me spread the webs of lines, the rows
Of carriages and trucks and shunting trains;
And darkly crimson glows the light that
stains
The moonless dark, and from the yards there
blows
A smell of smoke and soot. An engine sows
The dark with glowing sparks like carmine
rains:
Voices and whistles, shouts, the clank of
chains
Rise in a wave of sound that comes and
goes....
Fresh from a month of silent bush and hill,
The spaciousness of undulating plain,
I stand above the railway yards until
The city's sounds soak into me like rain- -
Voices and whistles, shouts, in accents shrill
Welcome a city-dweller home again.

Memories.
The moon, full-rounded, shining bright
(My room in darkness, save
For one pale patch upon the floor),
What holds my mood in thrall to-night
That sleep I do not crave ?
As, soft and low, a midnight wind
Comes telling of lone seas
To palm and pine on slope and peak,
All sweetly haunted is my mind
By hallowed memories.
While, far and nigh, a radiance cold
Wraps all, and no birds sing
Amongst the dew-wet leaves and fronds,
Reinless my fancy, uncontrolled,
Goes strangely wandering.
All willingly with her I go
Through spaces., deep and wide,
To meet once more the loved and lost,
Who dwell where neither ebb nor flow
Is there of time or tide.
Thus while the moon pours down her light,
And, telling of lone seas,
A late wind visits palm and pine,
I, sleepless,-dedicate the night
To hallowed memories.

Embrace.
A bee zooms, deep among the warm young
grasses.
Startled, the rose
Laughs, and sways backward from the wind,
her, lover:
“Fool! He will see!”
But that brown thief, grown bolder,
Unclasps the brooch of dew upon her shoulder
And draws her very close
That he may see the white breast rise and
fa 11....
Now, she cares not what passes,
Shadow, or leaf, or bee,
She does not care at all.
A white star gleams, a branch of almond
glistens.
They hear, they see!
Loosen your arms about me, in this quiet of
dusk, this lonely room,
Where scent of amber roses haunts the gloom!
You do not heed —and a slow moment passes,
Hushed as the wind among the blue-black
grasses,
Deep as an indrawn breath.
Ah, so your love stay nigh me
I care not what goes by me,
Splendor , or youth, or death....
I care not what star listens,
What silvered almond tree.

Summer Afternoon.
Beloved, come away!
The hawk wheels dizzily above the hills,
The black-winged hawk who goeth where he
wills.
Beloved, close your eyes!
Unhurried wings float darkly in the blue.
But I and you
Will listen to the streamlet’s lullabies
And press our faces to the drowsy clay.
Beloved, do not look!
The hawk is hovering above the sun.
Let us be one
With stable earth and amicable brook
And grass that we can hold the livelong day.
Beloved, come away!
The hawk sweeps dizzily across the sky,
The black-winged hawk we cannot long deny.
VICTORIA.

Simonizing, the world-famous method to restore used cars to their original show-
room beauty, will easily and quickly convert your car to a gleaming beauty that
will last for thousands of miles. Best of all is the satisfaction you feel after
Simonizing your own car at home. It looks better than new and you
have saved pounds you would have spent for repainting or a new car.
Just apply Simoniz Kleener in the green can to remove all dulness and stains and to restore the finish to the original
color the car was painted. Kleener is so soft in texture that it only removes the powdered, dull, oxidised lacquer,
and has no action on the good, clean lacquer on your car. No other cleaning agent is so wonderful in operation and
so harmless to the good finish. Next apply Simoniz ft-om the yellow tin to preserve the wonderful new finish you
have obtained with the Kleener. Simoniz provides a lustrous, transparent film of protection which, with just one
application, keeps the lacquer new for months of exposure and thousands of miles of travel. Sun, rain, dust, mud,
salt air or traffic fumes cannot mar a Simonized car. Be sure you ask for and get genuine Simoniz and Kleener.

Beware of polishes which are abrasive cleaners
only, rapidly wearing away the lacquer and leaving
no film of protection. Good painters know
Simoniz protects the finish
and Benzol easily removes it
for spraying.

save the life of the
Willard Battery!
INSULATION! . ... that’s the job of the Willard Patented Threaded
Rubber Insulator. It must separate each positive plate of the battery
from the negative. The better it does this, the longer the battery lives!
That’s why Willard uses rubber as insulation!
When you buy a Willard Thread Rubber Battery you get this Patented
Threaded Rubber Insulator, which has an insulating quality higher
than any other insulator used! This Willard Insulator is so strong
that it actually outlives the plates! Yet is thoroughly porous, allowing
the battery acids to Bow freely at all times- —which means that the
maximum power supply is always ready.*
A Willard Thread Rubber Battery will give you real economy. You’ll
get quicker starts and better service under all conditions longer
battery life —and your upkeep will be less! Ask your dealer about
the Willard Thread Rubber Battery!
This illustration
explains the Porosity
of the Willard Thread
Rubber Insulator.
Porosity simply means free flow of the bat-
tery acids through the insulator between each
positive and negative plate. The illustration
above shows clearly the tiny threads or wicks
which carry the acid through. There are
5,000 of these wicks to the square inch in the
Willard Threaded Rubber Insulator. This
means easier and quicker starting for you
under all conditions! Practically 85% of all
battery faults are due to the premature
failure of conventional insulators. Buy a
Thread Rubber Battery.
