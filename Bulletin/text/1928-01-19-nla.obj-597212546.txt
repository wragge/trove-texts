Mother India
We all know the returned-empty from
India who, when the natives are mentioned
as human entities, looks down his nose
and mutters “Kick ’em on sight. Sure to
deserve it. Only thing to do.” And we all
know that glow of contemptuous pity that
rises in our minds, not for the native but
for the martinet, the stupid insular man
who can’t or won’t grasp the message of
Kipling and the other good empire-publicity
men who have shown us so clearly the real
nature of the Indian. No wonder there is
always trouble in India, with men like this
weary wreck to misunderstand and mis-
govern, we remind ourselves, turning away
from the baffled wooden hatred in the fool’s
tired eyes.
But our Kipling-fed omniscience suffers
the defects of its qualities, as Katherine
Mayo in Mother India (Cape; Angus and
Robertson) tells us with her unfaltering
pitiless pen.
....In early October, 1925, I went to London,
called at India Office, and, a complete stranger, stated
my plan.
“AVhat would you like us to do for you?” asked
the gentleman who received me.
“Nothing,” I answered, “except to believe what 1
say.... I am neither an idle busybody nor a political
agent, but merely an ordinary American citizen seek-
ing test facts to lay before my own people.”
She safeguarded herself against inter-
ference, you see—made herself unofficially
official, so to say—and at the same time
kept her hands and pen free for the vast
job she had tackled.
One more quote will give the kernel of
the book:—
Take a girl child of 12 years old, a pitiful physical
specimen in bone and Dlood, illiterate, ignorant,
without any sort of training in habits of health.
Force motherhood upon her at the earliest possible
moment. Rear her weakling son in intensive vicious
practices that drain his small vitality day by day.
Give him no outlet in sports. Give him habits that
make him, by the time he is 30 years of age, a
decrepit and querulous old wreck —and will you ask
what has sipped the energy of his manhood?
The population of India is approximately
300,000,000; of the infants born alive about
2,000,000 die each year within the first
month after birth. Within the last decade
an epidemic of malaria slew more than
12,000,000, and destroyed the stamina of
many millions more. Bubonic plague is a
static, 11,000,000 deaths being its r’ecord to
date. T.B. accounts for about a million a
year; V.D. for God knows how many mil-
lions. Other horrifying figures are evidence
of a national vitality so low in its resistant
power that one wonders that there is any
native left for a poor old I.C.S. to kick.
The spring of all this, Miss Mayo assures
us, is the Indian sex-life inherent in Indian
religion. Procreation, child-bearing, abuses
which the other seven-eighths of the human
race despise and forbid—these are Hindu
articles of faith from the moment of their
possibility. The phallic Hindu doctrines
make sex in all its manifestations the one
great preoccupation and duty. The statues
and public ceremonies, the detailed amours
of gods and the religious sex-symbolism
proclaim this as searchingly as the Indian
home, its lullabies and love-songs, its
earliest childhood activities, proves it.
From_ the spring we go down into the
suffocating depths of the dreadful river
itself. The records of the purdah (women’s)
hospitals are a tale of maddened, torn and
ruined children unhappily not dead—brides
of a terrible dawn. While the children lie
staring at this vestige of life, their impatient
V.D.’d husbands call at the hospital to dis-
cover when they will be ready for service
again.
Behind the veil of the purdah, the harem
barrier that is 50 centuries old, Macbeth’s
witches would pause and turn back with
relief to the ordinary traffic of Hell. Old
mumbo-jumbos, old magics that the' Dark
Ages laughed to scorn, are here the ritual
of childbirth, the professional expert con-
duct of Mother India’s apotheosis, the head
of the household being perhaps a university
graduate. The filth and horror cannot be
set down again here. The barren wife and
the sqnless widow, “unclean” by caste; the
worship of the cow and the incredible dung-
hill of its ceremonial; the rotting pest-
house of the Holy City, the Benares to
whose far beauty this eighth of our race
looks for salvation and immortality
But what is the good of going on?
Deeper than knowledge, far stronger than
death, this dreary faith is the blood of the
Indian heart. These ashes of self-murder
are destiny, are Mother India.
HILARY LOFTING.
The Cloven Hoof
Somewhere in one of his works H. G.
Wells likens horned cattle to perambulating
vials of vim, implying that they are merely
so many refills of energy to assist mankind
on the road to Utopia. Taking the Scheme
of Things by and large, this may be true
enough—as true, at any rate, as Mr. Roger
Pocock’s assumption that the horse was
given to man to promote him from the
status of hunter to that of herdsman, thus
giving more time for the cultivation of the
arts, i.e., for the sharpening of his spear and
the overrunning of his neighbors’ hunting
grounds and pastures. And doubtless it is
true that without the horse and the steer
the human race would never have bred an
H. G. Wells.
Nevertheless, to the present-day herds-
man, both horse and bullock are something
more intimately interesting than a mere
tool and a potential bottle of bovril. Of
the horse there is no need to speak here,
others, and not the least among them Mr.
Pocock, having already covered the ground
from almost every point. But of cattle I
beg leave to say a few words.
In the first case, when observed at close
range, they show character. Each beast
has eccentricities which distinguish it from
its neighbor quite as much as the coloration
of its hide. In the same herd some are
nervous, some phlegmatic, some pioneers,
some laggards, some quick to get the hang
of new conditions, others hopelessly dull.
The struggle that an orphan calf will make
for existence, sometimes though rarely with
success, is an object lesson in persistence.
I call to mind one that hung around the
troughs where I was watering some 300 head
and who doggedly tackled each cow as she
came in. After many rebuffs he managed to
discover one or two from whom he could
pirate a little milk while their attention
was fixed on drinking. He kept this game
up for two weeks, but at last grew so feeble
that I had to kill him.
A modem poet speaks of the bull as the
symbol of Life’s sombre phallic will, with
the accent on the “sombre,” since the
“phallic” epithet is almost as applicable to
all that live and procreate. Indeed, there
is something weirdly sinister about the
behavior of cattle, not only in the cannibal
craving for bones and hides (“cows’ lollies,”
as some stockmen call them) which they
exhibit, but more especially in the corro-
borees they hold over their dead and dying
and even over the places where bodies have
lain months before. Stockmen attribute
this unholy excitement to the smell of
blood, but I have seen cattle bellowing and
pawing the tawny dust into blood-hued
clouds around dying cows who certainly
had no wounds and whose only indications
of approaching death were that they were
too weak to stand. There could have been
no smell of blood in that case, and there-
fore it almost seems that cattle are conscious
of and fear the approach of death, and that,
like certain savage tribes, they try to hide
this fear and to reassure themselves by
making a hullaballoo to drive the bogey
away. I don’t mean, of course, that they
have any conscious ideas on the matter,
but I think that their instincts prompt them
to relieve their extreme fear and uneasi-
ness in this way. A survival of this in-
stinct is noticeable even amongst civilised
men in the inclination felt by children and
nervous adults to shout and raise a racket
when left alone in the dark.
Another trait in cattle is their suscepti-
bility to the soothing effect of the human
voice. One does not need to be an Orpheus
when on night-watch. Any old chanty will
do so long as it is not too riotously rendered.
The great thing is neither to whoop and
bawl nor to creep around like a thief in
the night; for cattle, especially if over-
driven and worried, are just as liable to
rush at the sound of a snapped stick or
the sight of a suddenly cast shadow in the
firelight or moonlight as at a clap of thunder
or the sudden appearance of wild horses in
their midst—or even at the newly-arisen
moon, huge, flushed and golden, suddenly
swimming from behind some hill or low-
lying cloud where it has been delayed.
PETER HOPEGOOD.
Saul of Tarsus
Donn Byrne deserts the secular arm for
the sacred in Brother Saul (Sampson Low).
The apostle Paul does not appear to have
hitherto been a magnet for the story-
writer, yet without him Christianity in all
probability would never have been more
than a sect of Judaism. Donn Byrne’s work
is certain to provoke polemical emulation,
as with the great romances around Jesus—
from Eugene Sue to Lew Wallace and George
Moore. The last is first with the magical
“The Book Kerith”; his fellow Irishman
in “Brother Saul” does not quite achieve
Moore’s greatness.
In its deft and striking characterisation,
“Brother Saul” is controversial in almost
every touch, thrilling as are the brilliant
studies of Scriptural giants: the challenges
in rejoinder and rebuttal will doubtless be
wild and whirling. Of the apostle Peter,
for instance, it is chronicled as Paul’s
thought: “Peter had assumed a proconsu-
lar attitude. His gestures w T ere wide and
ample, and with him he had his boasting,
vulgar wife.” “Here was Peter, with his
curly head of a provincial dandy, his Jew-
ish side locks, and his wife who should still
have been gutting fish in Capernaum, over-
dressed, with her horrible Galilean accent.”
There is plenty of this sort of savagery
amid the opulence: it reveals so much left
out of the Bible. As supplementary to the
Pauline, epistles, “Brother Saul” clothes
words with flesh ■ and personages with pas-
sion. This “inside” story should be posi-
tively enthralling to people who in Vic-
torian times knew the Scriptures as they
are not known generally to-day.
The graceful glimpses into domestic vir-
tues are like strawberries in the mouth. As
a free-born Roman and a Greek of Tarsus,
Saul is sternly for law and order, Jew-born
as he is. He held that “the God of Israel
(Continued on page 5.)

a Pretty Rexona Girl.
Rexona Girls are world-famous for
their beautiful skin and hair. To be a
Rexona Girl is to use only Rexona Soap
and enjoy that natural beauty of skin and
hair which cannot be imitated, but can bs
obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this
influence. Many of them contain free
alkali, which tends to dry the skin and
destroy its delicate texture. Even the best
of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot
heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same sooth-
ing, healing, antiseptic balsams as Rexona,
the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the
treatment of skin affections is known
throughout the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial
Soap regularly once or twice a day and see
if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse
the pores, lessen the tendency to pimples
and leave the complexion clear, fresh and
velvety.
1. “Rexona Soap is the best soap I have ever come
across for keeping the complexion and hair in
perfect condition in all climates.”
—Miss ELLEN POLLOCK.
2. “I always use Rexona Soap. It is undoubtedly
the best soap for the skin and hair.”
—Miss BERTHA RICCARDO.
3. “My motto is Rexona.”
—Miss DOROTHY BRUNTON.
4. “I think there is nothing like Rexona Soap for
beautifying the skin and hair.”

A HOLIDAY IN CEYLON
CEYLON is at its best during the Australian
Summer. In the compass of an after-
noon’s motor drive one passes from the
warmth of Colombo to the crisp, sunny days
and cool nights at Nuwara Eliya. The buried
city of Anuradhapura and the Buddhist Temple
of the Tooth will interest the traveller. The
scenery is as varied as it is beautiful, and the
trees and flowers are a delight to the eye.
There are golf, tennis, fishing and shooting in
abundance. Roads and hotels are»*good and
cars are easily obtainable.
The Orient Line Excursion Fare to Colombo
from Brisbane is only £67 return, from Sydney
£65, Melbourne £63, Adelaide £6l, and
Fremantle £59.

is eternal,” but, consciously or uncon-
sciously, conceived Csesarism in the same
terms. Throughout he is the essential
Roman—never the rebel. He somehow
suggests Cecil Rhodes. He was the born
organiser, superb and supreme. “Old
Leather Lungs!” they shouted at him; these
knew not that the Word was God.
As the record progresses it seems to
shape as a Titanic battle of Paul with
Saul, and of both with the brethren. Color
is generously afforded by the temptations
to which the great ascetic, the born ancho-
rite, is subjected by alluring womanhood.
Of principal compelling attractiveness, how-
ever, is the conflict between Saul and Peter
and the factions of each. Byrne sets this
warfare of zealotry high on the hill for all
to see and study. Passage after passage is
rich with portrayal and pathos.
He was ever hot in the chase of Christian
“loose-livers in even loose-living Rome.”
He is worried over a Church professing
peace, yet invaded by revolutionary hot-
heads. “No man, no Caesar’s self, could
plot against Rome and live” —there, in one
stark sentence, stands Saul. He, a typical
Imperialist, was for the Empire against
sedition. He says for himself that “he had
robbed ' Judaism of half a million possible
converts, and so half a million possible
rebels against Rome, when the Day should
dawn.” He glories in this achievement. He
rages at “a mob of Christian communists”
who had seized provisions coming down the
Alban hills —“Saul could hardly believe it.
Everywhere he spoke of the duty of the
slave toward his master, of the citizen to-
ward the Empire; and no word was spoken
against him.” Ironically insinuating self-
righteousness or worse on Saul’s part, hear
Jude: “Saul wept, saying, ‘I have preached,
cast out demons, raised the dead—and they
have not crucified me.’ ”
Byrne’s scholarly fictional biography will
grip the attention of students of apostolic
or Mosaic doctrines because the argument
is correct to the times and both subtle and
shrewd. Charming poetry of prose is here
matched by retrospective yet creative in-
sight.
R.S. ROSS.
Film Stories
For an allegedly moribund industry the
movie business supplied the Film Commis-
sion with a surprising number of producers.
Though some are dead, many remain quick.
Those defunct include the Carroll concern,
whose principal is reported to have told the
Commission that its demise was partly due
to lack of Australian stories suitable for
dramatisation. A Miss Meredyth brought
by the firm to Sydney as scenario-writer
could find no national subject for movie-
making except horse racing.
My experience of movie producers in Aus-
tralia is interesting, and recently became
useful for comparative purposes. For in-
stance, while the Carroll interests were
active in movie production an inquiry if
they would consider Australian and other
stories brought the answer “No.” What, any-
how, is there of a national character in “The
Ten Commandments,” “Ben Hur” and
“Don Juan” which Australian writers could
not construct, and which, given the capital,
any producer in any country could not pro-
duce?
A few months ago I called on most of the
large producers in Hollywood, Culver City,
Melrose and Burbank. These accorded me
immediate and courteous attention, and I
discussed with story editors the subjects
required as movie material, and the time and
season when stories are purchased. Some of
the great producers do not consider outside
submissions; one concern has two-score
writers on its list, but persons who “have
the goods” are not debarred entry. Another
very large firm does not consider unsolicited
scenarios; but, under arrangement made
with the story-editor (who, by the way, is
Australian born), material was mailed from
Los Angeles prior to my departure for
Chicago. The Dead Letter Office sent the
matter after me to New York. Across the
original envelope is stamped: “The enclosed
is returned unopened because— Productions
Corporation does not read or accept unsoli-
cited manuscripts.” Because of accidental
omission to instruct the receiving depart-
ment to the contrary, the story hadn’t even
been brought under the editor’s notice. 1
saw producers of “quite some calibre,”
whose productions are regular features in
Australian cinemas, who never purchase
scenarios. All scenes; are concocted on the
premises. Judging "by the wildly chaotic
stories, such mirth-coinpellers could not well
be constructed by others than the per-
formers. Considering how easily a story
\an be applied to film use or several stories
combined into one film and the authors be
little the wiser, the* wonder is that any
producer bothers to pay for any novel or
story unless the names of an author and his
book are desired.
Nevertheless certain big producers are
agreeable to consider material. A producer
in a large way of specialty movies re-
quested, me to write specific kinds of stories
of special length. For one of these sub-
jects the action had to be laid in Western
Canada, but not in the winter.
In England the mcrvie industry was stag-
nant. In conversation the managing-director
of a large London concern said that Island
stories are barred because' big money had
been lost over a New Guinea production;
Australian subject for reason of distance
and consequent high cost of filming also are
taboo; a sea-story would be considered, but
without enthusiasm. Thus the scope was
narrowed down to the usual everyday and
society stuff. Movie producers, like others,
have their troubles and disappointments.
I perused various film-story contracts. The
sums involved were not so fabulous as
writers of scenarios in Australia imagine,
but even the lowest was large enough to
be tempting.
Another factor which impresses one
abroad—and especially in America —is the
competition in production of films and con-
sequent over-supply. Almost every studio
is well supplied with film stories; many
have commitments for more' than a year
ahead. Contracts signed long ago still
await production. Still from New York
movie material continues to pass on to
“the Coast.” Most of it goes back, but
some is sold.
In discussion as to points on which movie
stories are accepted by producers, a New
Yorker who has sold many, sometimes after
the story had travelled from New York to
“the Coast” and back several times, told me
he didn’t know, and concurred in a sug-
gestion that impulse evidently often decides
the choice.
ERNEST JOSBORNE.
Uncle Tom Pudd
I set that down—the title of the latest
book Cape’s have issued over the name of
Laurence Housman—with respect and sol-
emnity and envy. This last emotion is
stirred by the fact that in his 62nd year
Housman has achieved a piece of writing
that is alive with youth. It sparkles with
freshness; it bounds along with the energy
of nymphs heading for the baths; its humor
is clean as sunshine on ripe wheat. Every
page up to the last few chapters is the work
of an alert youthful mind; even the still
pathos that enters then comes from a
heart that has had its experiences in the
world only to feel the more fully the
warmth and worth of what is beautiful. I
begin to think that youth starts in the
62nd year.
My other feelings for the book are stirred
by those things and some others. I respect
it most because its humor is clean. I like
my humor that way. I cannot think there
is anything very funny in filth. The humor
of what is called “the suggestive,” too,
chiefly embarrasses. The laughter that
Stiffy and Mo and folk of their kidney raise
makes me feel sorry for something I cannot
quite track down. But a man who bribes
tramps with shillings to go and murder his
wife, and gives each of them a wrong
address out of sheer fascination for achiev-
ing the impossible—l can laugh at him.
Moreover, I can respect both him and his
creator, whereas I cannot assert similar feel-
ings about the delvers in the dunghills. I
can laugh, too, at a rector who establishes
a corner in threepennybits, because he
knows good old English tradition will pre-
vent his parishioners from putting pennies
in the plate, and then, when the churchgoers
send deputations to him to complain of
the comer, offers to sell the coins back at
fourpence-ha’penny each. I like the ridicu-
lous. One of the most racking laughs I
ever had was at a short, veiy dumpy, very
fat, very ponderous little woman who,
decked out in fluffy white crepe paper, with
a long white tail of it trailing behind,
pranced seriously across the judging-stand
in an advertising pageant and announced
in a very loud, very proud voice that she
represented Tooth’s White Horse....and
collected the third prize—an open order on
a cordial factory.
But I digress; also, I exaggerate—there
was no third prize. That, however, might
be excused of anyone who has read “Uncle
Tom Pudd.” The old chap is a king of
liars; in his lies rests his charm. They
are all so obviously damn lies. But even
such an old one as that of the gentleman
who in the train discovers ants in his
trousers, and, shaking the trousers out of
the window, loses them, becomes new at
his telling. I do not know Low old this
usually feeble yarn is, but I do know that
it has a curious fascination for Australian
women; as a reader of paragraph manu-
script on the Mirkor I received it from hun-
dreds of them in a couple of years—always,
of course, as an original and authentic hap-
pening. Mostly, however, “a veil is drawn
over what happened when the train got to
the station.” But Uncle Tom Pudd is a
better liar than that. His imagination fol-
lows the trousers through the window of a
passing express and into the lap of a
maiden lady who, travelling alone, is so
startled by the intrusion that she pulls
the communication-cord. In the meantime
Uncle Tom Pudd—the beautiful old liar—
has sold his trousers for £3 to the chap who
lost his, and, getting the others returned,
makes that much clear profit on the day.
I respect the ridiculousness in that, as I
do the same element in the separating of
Uncle Tom Pudd and Aunty Judith before
their honeymoon because Aunty Judith
(whose father was a Hogg and whose
mother was a Tape) insists that they shall
revert to the old family name of Pudbury.
His subsequent return to her, her nursing
of him that was “so obviously a revenge”
and his cry to the niece who visits him:
“Only five more years to live, my dear!
Don’t go!” also tickle my fancy. And then,
his tramp friends having failed, his own
splendid effort—how, glancing through a
window just as coffee has been served, he
sees his wife putting a white powder into
his cup, and manages to exchange the cup 3
because he believes the powder to be rat
poison. She drinks it.
Then she gave a start, and hung her nose over the
cup, smelling it suspiciously. “There’s something
very queer about this coffee,” she remarked.
“Yes,” I said, quite naturally giving it her in
the neck—“rat poison!”
The stuff was actually a sleeping dose, put
there that Aunty Judith might go through
his pockets undisturbed.
The other of the feelings with which I
set up the heading above —solemnity—is
stirred by the last chapter or two. I have
come to be sentimentally fond of the old
chap* his death is queerly touching. I can-
not help but feel solemn about his last
wish that the niece who has sheltered him
from Aunty Judith shall think of him when-
ever she feeds robins. A page or two back
the niece had taken him to task for carry-
ing an open jar of treacle up their village
street, and he had answered that a jar was
really the best thing in which to carry
treacle, a substance that does not parcel
very well.
Here I turn back and re-read the intro-
duction (it is the niece—who tells the story
—talking) :
“It is one of the advantages of cremation,” she
went on, “that you can do what you like with the
ashes —put them anywhere. His wife tried to get
hold of them ; so I gave her the casket, into which I
transferred some burned bones —cow and horse, prob-
ably-—anyway they satisfied her; and wearing the
regulation weeds, she had the Church of England
service read over them.”
That casting of the shadow before is an
old trick of the “Shropshire Lad’s” brother;
he used it with great effect in his “English-
woman’s Love Letters,” which created a
literary sensation in 1900, when he had
turned from illustrating the books of Mere-
dith and others to writing a few of his own.
CECIL MANN.
A Satchel of Books
Told Again, by Walter De La Mare (Basil
Blackwell). The traditional tales for chil-
dren rendered in the language of an acknow-
ledged master of letters.
Strange Disappearances, Elliott O’Don-
nell (John Lane). The cases described are
mostly historical and do not come further
down than the latter half of last century.
The B.H.P. Recreation Review (pub-
lished by the B.H.P. Recreation Club).
Another illustration of the wonderful growth
of Australia’s greatest industrial concern.
There is a fascinating story of the opera-
tions at Whyalla and Iron Knob, and the
infant days of the Prop, are recalled in the
biography of John .Tobson, now metallurgist
at the Steel Works, Newcastle.
The Army and Sea-power, by R. B. Par-
giter and H. G. Eady (Benn). The object
of this work is avowed by its authors to
be the presentment of a somewhat neglected
aspect of the work of the British Army, by
recounting the contribution of that body to
sea-power from early days to the present.
The book includes accounts of numerous
combined operations.
The Bush Boy’s Booh, by Donald Mac-
donald (Cornstalk Co.). The author’s many
years’ association with the men, women and
children of the bush and farm is a guarantee
that all the hints, the general information
and the lore contained within this handy
little book may be accepted with full con-
fidence. A revised and enlarged edition with
many illustrations.
The Wind That Wouldn’t Blow, by Arthur
Bowie Chrisman (Dent). Two years ago
the American Library Association awarded
its medal to the author for a distinguished
contribution to children’s literature, Shen
of the Sea.” That success is followed by
the present volume of “topsy-turvy Chinese
tales.” A quite exceptional book of its kind,
amply illustrated with silhouette decorations.
Brother John, by Vida D. Scudder (Dent).
A tale of the first Franciscans addressed to
“all who would fain learn what Saint
Francis li..s to teach the modern world.
Round the person of the young English friar
Brother John, is woven a story constructed
out of material provided in ancient records
telling of the agitations and ecstasies that
shook the disciples of Francis after his death.
The League of Missing Men, by J. M.
Walsh (Cornstalk Co.). In the history of
Lucas Viglon and his almost perfect crime
this Australian author shows no decline in
vigor, but an increasingly strong hold on the
technique of this branch of the novelist s
art. Even the experts in detective analysis
will find more than passing difficulty in fore-
telling the secret underlying the activities of
the league. . ,
The Australian and New Zealand Writers
and Artists’ Year Booh, 1928. A direc-
tory for writers, artists and photographers.
The freelance has labored under the serious
disadvantage of having to obtain by per-
sonal experience and with waste of time
information that if in a collated form
would have been invaluable to him. 11ns
directory aims at supplying that informa-
tion. It is edited by C. V. Ringstad and
W. E. Fitz Henry, who have laid the founda-
tion of a work of reference and direction
that will become increasingly indispensable
with its periodical revisions and additions.
Well compiled, lucidly written and of dis-
tinct service to all associated with imagina-
tive literature, journalism and illustrative
art, it should receive an encouraging wel-
come.
The Earlier Inhabitants of London , by F.
G. Parsons (Cecil Palmer). For 30 years
Professor Phrsons has been engaged in
probing into the physical anthropology of
the inhabitants of the British Isles, and
more especially of those grouped m London,
up to the date of the Norman Conquest. At
the time of Harold’s defeat, seven-eighths of
the inhabitants of the capital city were of
Nordic blood. The Mediterranean race
formed but a small percentage of its residents,
and the Alpine element a still smaller. ‘ The
modern Londoner,” says the author, "no
doubt has received a great deal of both
Alpine and Mediterranean blood since the
Norman Conquest; and the Alpine type
especially seems to be increasing at the pre-
sent time. The research, however, which I
have been able to make among the hospital
patients and medical students of London
makes me sure that the modern Londoner is
still three-quarters Nordic in his character-
istics, though I am conscious that a new
type of head form is gradually being evolved;
a type for which neither Mendelism nor
reversion will account."

the ankle. The lacing is arched
to prevent strain over the instep.
A wide welt smartly finishes
the sole, which is of even thick-
ness from toe to heel. The toe-

Cranberg’s Course.
I’m chums with Herman Ivrymbourg
And he is chums with me,
And when we do not quarrel
The best of friends we be.
Herman loves the Gippsland shore,
I love the Gippsland sea.
You’ve noticed, like the most of us,
That your appointed lurk,
The job that brings your daily bread,
You always want to shirk.
You’d rather be, in fancy, on
Some other daily work.
I'd love to be a seaman with
The wheel unto my hand,
And take my chances as they came
Of reef and cliff and sand.
He'd love to be a penman, and
Attempt a bit of land.
This makes for war. When Herman’s ship,
The Topsy, beats her way
From Cunningham and dumps our stores
In Mallacoota Bay,
I'll mooch along to have a word,
Or some concession pray.
Red-eyed for want of sleep he rears
His features from below :
That he will curse the Seven Seas
And all the ships that go
Around the world and down the world
Till seven bells I know.
I know he’ll swear by awful gods
This stunt will be the last
Of all sea-going stunts for him
As to the Topsy’s mast
He rigs unloading tackle
And makes his shore-lines fast.
From Cranberg (so the locals call
This Scandinavian bird)
The same decision fifty times
The last ten years I’ve heard;
And if we last for fifty more
I know he’ll eat the word.
If Cranberg’s tongue must sometimes ease
The wrath of Krymbourg’s mind,
’Tis not for us who never race
Before a sudden wind,
'Tis not for us who live ashore
Like our shore-staying kind,
And never steer on Cranberg’s course,
A critic word to say!
We do not freight the Topsy’s fish
From Mallacoota Bay;
We do not fight a norther on
Our slow returning way.
If, east-nor’--east from Cunningham,
We had to work with care,
And then to dodge the greedy reefs
That wait around Beware,
Perhaps we’d grow more tolerant
And maybe learn to swear.
Two points nor’-east would bring us up,
With luck, to Little Ram ;
But by that time (a sneering scribe
Perhaps, my dear, I am),
I’m sure a deacon would have learned
At least to whisper “damn.”
And when, by steering north and east
Before a making gale,
We saw the Bastion looming up
All in the morning pale,
And knew our cake was blinkin’ dough
And at the bar we’d fail;
With nothing l-eft but Twofold Bay,
And that a doubtful dope,
I fear our deacon would be heard
To curse the Kbman Pope,
King William and the box o’ tricks—
Faith, Charity and Hope !
I’m chums with Herman Cranberg;
Ourselves we understand.
I love the ever-r-estless sea,
He loves the restful land.
I’m pals with Herman Cranberg;
Ourselves we understand.

Sleep.
Where do I journey when I sleep?
What tryst there far-off do I keep
When from these prison-walls of flesh
I am unloosed, and free and fresh
To speed my spirit’s tireless flight
Through untrod spaces of the night?
The veiled, slow memories that seem
To glide by shadowed doors of dream
Into this dark confining room
Of waking flesh speak, through the gloom,
Of some strange distafit lovely Place
Where I have seen a wondrous Face.
When from my slumbers I arise,
The glory of its burning eyes
Still glimmers palely in my brain,
Transmuting all the darkening pain
Of day’s old dullness into fire
Of Power, and joy-winged Desire.
Where do I journey when I sleep?
When 1 have sailed the unseen deep
Of consciousness, and somewhere found
Another Shore, where Love unbound
Can every gulf of distance leap,
What tryst there far-off do I keep?

A King Goes Past.
“Ho !’’ said the child, “how the proud horses
go
With feathered step along the road so slow!
Who rides abroad with all this majesty—
Is it some prince who seeks the world to
see?”
And as I looked I saw a coffin lay
Half-hid in flowers as they went their way—
►So small, a woman might have held it pressed
Light as a jewelled casket to- her breast.
“Ho!” said the child, “how the proud horses
shake
Their silvery harness till they music make!
Who rides abroad with all this pomp and
show —
Is it some king who seeks the world to
know?”
And as I looked above her head once more
I saw within the windowed carriage door
A woman’s face, whose mother eyes ablaze
Seized on a child with fierce and famished
gaze.
“Death drives,” I said, and drew her in
alarm
Within the trembling shelter of my arm,
As in my heart cried out a thousand
fears....
A king goes past! She wondered at my tears.

The Drowned Butterfly.
Look! Here upon the sand a lovely thing,
Lying among the sea-shells, foam-enlaced —
A drenched white butterfly,
Each silken wing,
Once iridescent, ebon-chased,
Broken and brushed
With the wild sea,
Its little feathered body crushed
Piteously !
0 lovely thing ! Poor fragile butterfly !
How came it so to die,
This shining jewel of a summer’s day?
Perhaps it saw the low-hung, quivering
spray,
White as old almond-bloom
Above the sea;
And winged far out, its flight a rhapsody,
Unto the swift, sharp doom
Of the tide’s swirling race,
Looking to find some strange, new garden
there,
Pale-blossomed, fair,
With perfumed flowers
Above the towers
Of crystal and of chrysoprase!
And now where all the shells are spread
Like petal-drifts—look ! it lies dead !
I cannot bear to think, this hot sweet day,
Of that short life, shorter than hours of
spring.
Here for one shining flash, then swept away—
j O beautiful, poor thing!....
Yet what of me!
j Am I not as some restless butterfly,
Questing the joys of life on radiant wing,
j Knowing the while (O rebel I!)
That even as I soar, unbounded, high,
Just out beyond there sounds forebodingly,
The murmur of death’s dark relentless sea?

The Old Roads.
Beyond the surfaced city streets,
Beyond the ordered ways,
My roving spirit gaily greets
The roads of other days.
The rough roads,
The gruff roads
That wound among the trees;
The red roads,
The dead roads
That slept in careless ease!
Beneath the rugged, smiling hill
A farmhouse stood, serene,
And soft-eyed cattle lazed at will
Upon the luscious green.
And true gums,
Tall blue-gums,
Stretched out their eager arms—
To gay skies
And grey skies
They vaunted wooded charms.
Above, the rich-toned magpie sang,
The locusts loudly chirrdd ;
About the pool bush-voices rang,
And tiny bush-things stirred.
O marching roads,
O parching roads
That stung the aching throat!
O smiling roads,
Beguiling roads
Where sorrows were remote!
There, by the sheltered billabong,
Where mirrored Nature gleamed,
Soft-lulled by happy morning-song
I lay and dreamed, and dreamed....
O rough roads,
And gruff roads,
Despite your dusty pail,
Your
Are high-roads
To those who hear your call!

COMPOSITION
CONTAINERS
The material used for Exide - Monobloc
Containers is the result of the most careful
selection and trial over many years. It
is superior to the ordinary compositions
used for battery containers in that it is
mechanically stronger, will stand higher
temperatures, is electrically a better insulator,
and chemically inert. The finish is every-
thing that can be desired for running-board
mounting, and enables the expense of an
outer polished wood box to be dispensed
with. Exide Monobloc Batteries entirely
eliminate all troubles due to the use of wood
trays, and are particularly recommended for
use in tropical climates.

WHAT MUST WE DO TO BE SAVED?
There are signs of a financial landslide on
a large scale, but there is still time to
avert it. The date of the last one may be
approximately fixed by the fall in State
revenues, which was visible as regards Vic-
toria in 1890, and as regards N.S.W., Queens-
land and South Australia in 1893. It was a
mild smash so far as the amount of real
money was concerned, but the effects were
so far-reaching that the public income of
Victoria did not attain the old figure till 1911.
The banks had taken large amounts of
short-dated deposits in England and Scot-
land, and planted the money in indefinitely
long investments here. When, owing to a
financial crisis in the Cold Country, the
short-dated deposits mostly failed to be re-
newed there, attempts were made to realise
on the indefinite investments here, the result
being to produce very little cash and to
greatly depreciate the securities, or insecuri-
ties. That landslide can’t be exactly dupli-
cated because the banks have got rid of
the craze for collecting deposits in Britain.
Their liabilities are mostly payable here, in
Commonwealth paper money, and it is
assumed that in the event of a local crisis
the Commonwealth would print sufficient
paper to meet it. This might cause some
depreciation and raise prices, but there
would be no repetition of ’93.
❖ ❖ *
The present position is that the States
want their loans renewed as badly as the
banks wanted their deposits renewed 35
years ago, and so far they have always
secured a renewal, which the banks didn’t.
But they are not only compelled to say, as
the banks did in years gone by,' that they
are quite unable to meet the bill on the
due date; they also explain that it is abso-
lutely necessary to get additional loans, and
the banks never insisted on additional
deposits. Certainly, nowadays there is a
Central Government to lend assistance,
which wasn’t the case in the years around
’93; but it is a question whether the Central
Government has any superfluous assistance
left—unless it takes strenuous measures to
suppress the importing craze and put right
the balance of trade. It lately eked out a
local renewal loan of its own by printing
a few extra notes.
$ * * *
In and about the date of the Previous
Landslide it was not uncommon, despite
spells of extravagance, for the surplus of
exports to fully cover a State’s external
liabilities. Thus between 1892 and 1897
Victoria added only £155,186, or about
£31,000 per annum, to its public liabilities.
In 1921 and 1922, when its railway pro-
gramme and other works should have been
getting on towards completion, it spent
borrowed funds at the rate of over £32,000
per day, so much had the popular view-
point shifted, and there has been no great
improvement since. It was possible in the
not-very-remote days of the Previous Land-
slide for the six States to show in the
aggregate a surplus of revenue over ex-
penditure in eight years out of ten. Now
a dozen large consecutive deficits, some of
them running to millions, are on record.
The financial shortage shown by the rail-
ways has become chronic and enormous.
Some 35 years have been available for re-
organisation since the Previous Landslide,
but little use has been made of them. No
new States, and consequently no new State
capitals, have been established. No new
city has been created with the possible ex-
ception of Canberra, and it isn’t a city yet.
No new ports have been developed, and the
diverse railway gauges, which hamper trade
in a costly fashion are 13,000 miles worse
than in 1893, and do more damage to trade
because there is more to be damaged.
Though State capitals have bloated
beyond recognition, a number of promising
towns have fallen into decay, or at least
into stagnation, since 1893; and a solid area
of 523,620 sq. miles, the Northern Territory,
has fewer inhabitants than it had then,
though it didn’t reach the 5000 mark even
in those mildly roaring days.
# t- *
The only way to avert trouble is by
emphatic restriction of imports. If it
is allowed to come on the community
unprepared, the difference will be that be-
tween a ship being stopped just in time
to keep off a rocky shore and the same
vessel stopping itself by collision with the
rocks; In the latter case it is likely to be
an immeasurably bigger and more protracted
event than the Previous Landslide. There
will be less credit with which to meet it
because credit is more extensively used up,
and fewer reserves of taxation because they
are so extensively used up likewise. A new
feature will be the existence now of a large
Red body (at least it looks large, and acts
as if it were, and it is certainly Red) which
desires a new and gigantic disaster, in the
hope that it will open the way for a large
and gory revolution. This element may
meet with a temporary success and do an
immensity of damage, as their kind did at
Canton, even though their ultimate col-
lapse is assured.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Tasman Fliers.
Not since the epic story of the fate of
Scott and his companions in the Antarctic
was flashed around the world has the inter-
est of the people of Australia and Maori-
land been so strongly aroused as by the
ill-starred attempt of Moncrieff and Hood
to fly the Tasman. At the time of writing
the fate of the aviators is still in doubt.
It has been demonstrated by experts that
the adventure was an ill-considered one;
that the ’plane chosen for the flight was
not ideally suitable for its task; that the
airmen were insufficiently acquainted with
its peculiarities, and that they chose an
unfavorable season for their flight. On
both sides of the dark blue gulf they
attempted to span the opinion has been ex-
pressed that the adventurers risked their
lives for nothing—that even if they suc-
ceeded they could prove nothing that was
not already known.
Very sensible and reasonable criticism;
but there is not a good sport in Australasia,
or anywhere in Anglo-Saxondom, who would
let it stand as an epitaph. The feat
attempted is big enough to command re-
spect, and it stands in a category a little
higher in the utilitarian scale than Polar
explorations. Nobody who knows anything
of the progress and possibilities of aviation
doubts that eventually the mail and pas-
senger traffic across the Tasman will be
air-borne. The inexplicable thing is that it
should be left to a little handful of en-
thusiasts in the smallest Dominion to find
the money and provide the men for the
pioneer attempt.
Undertaken as an official venture, in a
British sea-plane or amphibian of approved
t3 r pe, with the course navally patrolled—
as the Yankees did in their first trans-
Atlantic and round-the-world flights—and
with an aerial convoy to conduct the flyers
to their landing place, the feat might have
been robbed of every foreseeable risk. In-
stead it has been left to a Scot and a one-
legged Maorilander to take all the hazards.
They were foolhardy, of course, but the
Empire was made by just such men, and
every international highway in the world
has the bones of reckless pioneers sunk
deep in its paving. Sheer pluck and grit
are never wasted, though they lead to dis-
aster. When the British commence to
shirk great adventures because they are
dangerous it will be time for some foreign
annotator to write “Finis” to the history
of the race.

Cows and Dr. Haden Guest.
Haden Guest, ex T M.P. for a Cockney con-
stituency, is roaming Australia, and advises
this country to “concentrate more on pri-
mary production,” which probably means
that it should buy its manufactured goods
from Britain. In the interests of the com-
munity at large the situation should be
stated more clearly than it generally is.
The following figures are dug out of the
most recent Federal publications:—
Gross
Persons Output per
Employed. Gross Output. Employee.
Pastoral .. 87,902 £113,327,000 £1290
Agricultural . . 204,662 89,267,000 436
Dairying .. 139,570 47,161,000 339
Mining . . 54,999 24,646,000 448
Factory .. 450,920 400,342,000 872
A number of considerations wander into
the argument, and make a closely reasoned
conclusion impossible. The farming man
has to find his own land, tools, animals,
fences, seed, bags, fertiliser and sundries.
The pastoralist has to find land and stock
and spend a lot in other ways. The miner
or the factory hand, as a rule, only supplies
himself, though the boss in either line has
to furnish a multitude of things. But the
net output of factories (the difference
between the cost of fuel and raw material
on one hand and the value of the finished
output on the other) is stated at £143,256.000
(another table gives it as £155,424,000), so
net factory yield is now greater than the
gross jdeld of the best of the raw material
industries, and the gross value of factory
output is more than equal to the gross
output of the four great primary businesses
put together.
As a provider of employment, manufac-
ture promises ere long to amount to more
than pasture, agriculture, mining and cow in
combination, for it is the only line in
which the number of workers has so far
contrived to show steady expansion. The
others find work for less than they did. And
in addition to all else, the import figures
show that there is room even with the
existing population for many more factories
to supply local requirements. On the other
hand the putting of small men on the soil
to grow wheat is an effort at further com-
petition for the trade of distant markets.

“The Bulletin” in 1928.
Twelve months ago The Bulletin set
out to make itself indispensable to another
body of readers, and, along with a large
increase in size, introduced the Service
Department, the Farmers’ Section and
“Smoke-oh.” All three have proved more
popular than it had been sanguine enough
to even hope for.
Thus encouraged, The Bulletin is about
to do more things of equal or greater im-
portance. In the first place, the paper
will be published on Wednesdays instead
of Thursdays. The change will be made as
from January 25. This will give agents
an extra sales-day in the week, and allow
the all-Australian paper to reach almost all
Australia by the week-end.
Next, the section given to short stories
and special articles will be greatly extended.
This year 200 stories will be printed. There
never was a time, as the Christmas Bul-
letin showed, when so many good short
stories were being written in Australia; and
the 50 already purchased are astonishingly
good.
Incidentally, the drawings in 1928 will be
found to reach a higher general level than
at any previous time in The Bulletin’s
history. The paper asks its readers to
consider the illustrations in this issue—which
have not been specially selected—and, re-
membering also Jardine’s contributions,
decide whether this claim is not a
thoroughly good one.
The large improvements made in the
paper during last year gave such results in
the matter of circulation—which is the best
test of public approval—that the further
improvements are launched with bright
hopes. It is the fashion to say that this
generation is interested only in jazz and
garters—that it is the da) r of “stunt”
journalism. The Bulletin declines to be-
lieve anything of the sort about its Aus-
tralia and will at any rate continue to pin
its faith to service. And it thinks it knows
its own country well enough to be quite
confident of the result.
Cornstalk Railways.
The report of the N.S.W. Railway Com-
missioners for the year to June 30, 1927,
isn t a dazzlingly cheerful document, but
much dazzle wasn’t expected. Fifty-two
lines or sections (3473 miles out of a total
of 5750) failed to pay working expenses and
interest on the eternal loan, as compared
with 51 (3500 miles) the previous year.
Thirty-two of them paid no interest at all
and couldn’t even cover working expenses,
as compared with 23 a year previously. The
railway deficit, as apart from the tramways,
was £451,618, which was better than the
previous year’s effort, the shortage then
being £830,671. The cheerful distribution
of “awards” by legal gentlemen of no prac-
tical experience who sit on benches and
throw hours and wages about with a firm
h.and added £638,818 to working expenses,
but charges were increased, and it is men-
tioned that they may be increased again.
Possibly they may be increased many times
again.
Freights are practically all higher than
they were 20 years ago, 75 per cent, higher
in some cases. But 20 years ago the Ma
State paid £3 12s. Id. per cent, interest on
its whole debt, and now, owing to years of
razzle, it pays over £5 per cent., which is one
of the matters that make a difference. A
peculiar feature is that there were only
miles more line operating than at June,
1926, but there was £7,551,481 more bor-
rowed money operating, which is a good
deal when it operates at over 5 per cent,
per annum. One of the additional scraps
is the city line from the Central station to
St. James, and it cost £1,696,122 per mile.
It might possibly have been better to spend
the money on the beginnings of a new
seaport city, and relieve the traffic con-
gestion that way.
A matter which sticks out further than
the under-jaw of ex-Premier Lang concerns
the freights on some “primary” products.
Average charges were 12s. 6d. per ton per
100 miles, and apparently the work cost
more, hence the deficit. But manures were
carried at 3s. 6d., grain, flour, etc., at ss. 5d.,
and hay, straw and chaff at 6s. 4d. per ton
per 100 miles. It would thus appear that
agriculture needs _ a very big indirect sub-
sidy to keep it going. The explanation may
be that the average distance which grain
and flour are humped on the N.S.W. lines
is now 246 miles, while for hay, straw and
chaff the distance is 291 miles. It is a great
deal of humpage to pay for at full rates,
especially if the goods are struggling along
to the only permissible port as the first
instalment of a journey half round the
world. If wheat-growing for foreign mar-
kets spreads out to the long-distance regions
that some enthusiasts dream of, the policy
of carriage-below-cost may land the rail-
way system in a financial hole of unexpected
depth; and the fact that a mile-and-a-
fraction of city railway is trying to earn
working expenses and £105.000 per annum
for interest is a considerable hole already.
Why Only Wheat?
Premier Collier, of Westralia, who is an
improvement on many of his predecessors,
has his eagle eye fixed on wheat. This is
an Australian characteristic. He hopes for
a 50 or 60 million bushel crop for 1929, and
it is a laudable ambition. If tl e result is
achieved Westralia will be approximately
level in the matter of production with the
United Kingdom and Poland, though far
behind Rumania and Spain. It will lick
Bulgaria. The area under crop is less than
one per cent, of Australia, and of this cul-
tivated area 60f per cent, is wheat; in
Westralia it is 72 per cent.
The desire to grow a great surplus of
this vegetable for export, whatever else
goes short, has taken deep root. Westralia
buys, from outside its own huge and thinly-
peopled territory, butter, butter substi-
tutes, cheese, eggs, fish, honey, bacon,
hams, poultry, milk and cream, arrowroot,
raisins and other dried fruits, beans, peas,
barley, rice, hops, jams, jellies, onions,
potatoes, etc. In this respect the big State
isn’t quite alone. It is common for the
Commonwealth as a whole to be short of
beans, peas, oats, maize, potatoes and
onions, while of 23 less familiar vegetables
the shortage is chronic and importation is
a matter of course. So long as there is a
handsome surplus of wheat for export, how-
ever, a general feeling prevails that “pri-
mary production” is getting along. But if
the price of wheat gets low the outlook
will be blue, and if the price of the vic-
tuals which Australia buys abroad doesn’t
go down to correspond the outlook may be
grey or even striped.
If Westralia (or any other State) con-
trived to grow or make (say) three mil-
lions worth per annum more of the goods
that are used locally, even if it exported
three millions’ worth less of wheat as an
indirect consequence, it would save freight
on six millions worth of articles, which is
always a consideration. And if, in supply-
ing the home market, the price goes up, the
local producer gets more; if it goes down
the local consumer pays less. But if the
value of wheat abroad goes down to the
figure of 1894, it will be a purely one-sided
transaction, and wholly disastrous.
A
Australia’s Worst Habit.
Dear Bulletin,— -Customs Minister Prat-
ten gave himself and Australia a
Christmas box by relating the establishment
in Australia of industries from oversea dur-
ing 1928 —MoRLEY,of Nottingham, at Ballarat,
and Lewis and Co., of Nottingham, at Mel-


bourne; a Swiss firm at Bendigo, and a
new American hosiery concern also;
Stewart and Lloyd, at Newcastle and
Michael Nairn and Co., linoleum manu-
facturers, at Auburn; the American firm of
Dupont and Nemours to manufacture arti-
ficial leather and a British concern to make
electrical equipment.
The new hosiery duties bring the Morley
and Lewis concerns to Australia; but
what’s the matter with Bonds? And Nairn
and Co. are to make linoleum, but why did
Australia’s only carpet factory, established
with Charleville and other West Queens-
land money, collapse at Botany? What’s
the matter with the Australian? Is he such
a slave to the oversea tradition that he must
spend his money with an importer rather
than a manufacturer? Apparently it is so.
Bonds’ cotton turkish towels made of Aus-
tralian cotton are better than the English
towel at a higher price; yet the English
towel is still imported. The Foy and
Gibson socks I wear have better and more
material in them than the imported sock
at twice the price. Some of these “Target”
brand socks which I bought in 1921 were
thrown away in 1925, not because they were
worn out but because constant washing
and sun-exposure had turned the black dye
to a green. These socks retail at 30s. a
dozen, yet there is a great market for
imported socks, not as good nor as generous
in the leg portion of the material, at double
the prices. The steel business of Australia
also gets a black eye by reason of Sydney
Ferries’ bad habit of building its ferry
boats in Scotland. All this argues that the
average Australian, and especially the
average Australian woman, is a foolish
snob who despises the home commodity and
buys the high-priced imported commodity
because to him (or her —principally her)
price is the only standard of value.
Meantime Australia builds its national
debt higher by flooding itself with cheap-
labor manufactures of Czecho-Slovakia and
the German. Apparently the war was
fought partly to make this democracy safe
for the importer.—Yours, Randolph Bed-
ford.

The Tahiti’s Speed.
“X.N.0.”: Mr. Justice Campbell has pro-
bably created both a record and a prece-
dent in his finding, re the Tahiti and the
Greycliffe, that the speed of the former was
the sole cause of the disaster. I will not
be positive but, barring fog—and I cannot
recall a fog case either —I do not think
that ever before has the whole blame been
laid at the door of excessive speed.
If this accident had occurred in mid-
ocean and the overtaking vessel had been
found at fault, she would have been blamed
for not altering course. Her speed would
never have been mentioned. And if, as
Mr. Evans for the pilot remarked, the
Tahiti had been a Manly ferry permitted
to go at any speed, the verdict would have
been that the accident was due to her fail-
ure to alter her course, not her speed.
A couple of spokes to starboard would
have done the trick in open sea, but in
enclosed waters and in a comparatively
narrow channel, where there Was an obliga-
tion on the Tahiti to keep to starboard,
or in this case to southward, in order
to give sea-room to incoming craft,
course alterations are restricted. She could
not, however, keep more to starboard than
she did because the Greycliffe, whose
master admits he did not know the Tahiti
was there, gave her no room. There was
an identical obligation on the Greycliffe
also to keep to starboard both to clear
incoming traffic and to give any overtak-
ing vessel —a Manly ferry, for example—
room to pass without being unduly bored
over to port, or in this case towards Brad-
ley’s Head. This aspect of the question
seems to have received no consideration
from the Court.
Admittedly the Tahiti’s speed of 12
knots made her an overtaking vessel; but
seamen will, in spite of Mr. Justice Camp-
bell, retain their own ooinion as to the
immediate cause of the accident. It cer-
tainly was not the Tahiti’s speed alone
irrespective of her course and the course of
the Greycliffe.

Tram Stops and Street Traffic.
If Melbourne does decide to run trams
down Collins-street, the “safety zones”
which are a feature of the wider of Sydney’s
streets will no doubt be introduced. These
are small areas along the lines at tram
stops, marked off by posts. But Melbourne
will guess wrong if it thinks they solve the
problem. They serve a good purpose, it is
true, for once inside the area the pedestrian
waiting for a tram is safe from passing
motor-cars. But he still has to run the
gauntlet to get from the footpath to the
area.
Slackening of speed when coming abreast
of a stationary tram used to be the pedes-
trian’s best chance; now the car drivers
don’t worry, as the prospective tram pas-
senger is safely fenced off inside the posts
on the tramline. But the person on the
footpath who wants to get out to the
safety area is forced to take his life in his
hands whenever the streets are crowded
with traffic.
The trolley ’bus may help to solve the
problem. Hundreds of accidents to pedes-
trians are caused while they are alighting
from or boarding a tram. If you remove
the tram you do away with the pedes-
trian’s reason for being afoot on the street,
and automatically you keep him on the
footpath, where a motor or trolley ’bus
can pick him up in safety.

Easy Divorce and Soluble Matrimony.
In the U.S.A., where a single Prohibition
drink-seller is said to have made 14 million
dollars out of the business, and where it
is hoped that divorces will one day out-
number weddings, the idea of “companion-
ate” or trial marriages is growing in popu-
larity. Among its advocates are mentioned
Judges, professors, parsons and leading
atheists.
Practically all U.S. marriages are “trial’
nowadays; yet the divorce mill, grind it
never so hard, doesn’t grind hard enough.
Hence a marriage which will automatically
end itself at a fixed date, like a lease, would
have advantages. A recently quoted
authority is a Californian Supreme Court
Judge, who is reported to have said that in
about 80 per cent, of the cases where
separation is granted on account of mis-
conduct. the misconduct is purely imagin-
ary, being a libellous and perjured state-
ment agreed upon by the parties and winked
at by the Law’s other eye. Therefore his
Honor is said to advocate the system fol-
lowed in Soviet Russia, where the parties,
or either party separately, may drop into
the proper establishment and buy a divorce
at the bargain counter when he, or she, or
they can force a way through the crowd.
Whether it is possible for a larcenous per-
son to shoplift a divorce is a matter with
a haze around it.
There is room for wide speculation as to
the results to be expected after 20 or 30
or 40 years of very easy divorce and fre-
quent remarriage. There will almost cer-
tainly be a tendency on the part of the
man to seek a new mate who is younger
than the previous one, and unless the
mature and shaken-off lady has money,
like Victoria Hohenzoli-ern, who lately
purchased in holy matrimony a male of
half her years, she will probably have to
do without a new partner. This may be
the case even if she is willing to put up
with a succession of inferior specimens,
each a worse wife-beater than the last. In
Russia no woman has money, and the
Yankee lady, even if she was affluent to
begin with, might soon lose her all in the
matrimonial market or by other bad invest-
ments. (In this connection Princess Vic-
toria’s venture will probably turn out ill,
both financially and otherwise, especially
if her husband becomes intoxicated with
the knowledge that he is the only ex-ship’s
cook in the world who is in a position to
cane an ex-emperor’s sister.)
The prospect for the future is a land of
early marriages, arising through elderly and
much-divorced men wudding young girls,
and also a land with a repulsive abundance
of middle-aged shop-worn women, un-
attached, and with the poorest possible
chance of becoming attached any more. A
policy of strictly limited divorce, which
makes marriage something resembling a life
contract, may lead to a lot of hardship; but
perfectly soluble matrimony seems capable
of leading to much hardship also —perhaps
to more than the other thing. It is the
unlucky and disappointing way with many
devices for the production of unlimited
happiness.
Putting Bumble Back.
Though usually on the side of the angels,
Dickens made a subtle attack on the most
highly cherished of his country’s institutions
when he drew his caricature of Bumble.
Luckily for the Old Dart, the shaft missed
its mark, and the parishes, boroughs and
counties retain their ancient rights and
powers. The United States, building their
fabric of government on the English pat-
tern, leave at least half the sphere to local
authorities. Only in Australia have the
powers of local government been whittled
away until they are so small that it is a
wonder self-respecting citizens take the
trouble to administer them.
The adoption by the Bavinshaws of the
principal recommendations of the New
States Commission gives the senior State
an opportunity to regain the road from
which it strayed 70 years ago. Like other
States, N.S.W. ran away from Bumble, but
didn’t succeed in eluding him. The process
of centralisation merely shifted' him from
the parish to Parliament, where the worst
features of his Bumbledom found a wide
and varied field for expression. The result
was only what might have been expected.
In communities organised on the British
plan, most politicians serve their apprentice-
ship on local bodies. The more powerful
and responsible the local bodies the better
is the training they afford in the business
of government, and the larger is the field
from which men can be selected for the
control of national affairs. The Bavin-
shaws aim to hand over to the munici-
palities most of the responsibilities such
bodies enjoy in older lands. The new
District Councils will have to administer
at least part of the laws relating to health,
education, police protection and justice.
They will carry out a variety of public
works at present entrusted to the State
Government.
To a certain extent —certainly to a far
greater extent than is possible under exist-
ing conditions —these activities will be taken
out of the sphere of party politics. They
will be watched critically by people on the
spot, who will resent waste and ineptitude
because it will directly affect their own
pockets. A central government is a vague
aloof collection of high-salaried strangers,
responsible to nobody but party bosses. A
local government has to live on its job;
and it gets kicked with enthusiasm by the
populace whenever it makes a blunder.
Larger powers of local government ought to
give Australians more respect for the law
and more concern for efficiency in the con-
duct of public affairs.

The Meat Trade.
Dear Bulletin, —The 1914 Royal Commis-
sion on the Queensland Meat Industry (B.
15/12/’27) was not appointed to inquire
into American or other oversea influence on
the Australian meat trade. The managing
director of Swifts’ works, then being erected
-on Brisbane River, gave evidence before
the Commission and quite frankly stated by
whom the Australian works were being built
and controlled, remarking that Americans
were investing their money here but were
registered as a Queensland company and
were amenable to the laws of the country.
The report of the Commission, subsequently
issued, dealing generally with questions of
adverse control of the meat trade, stated
that there was ample opportunity for ex-
ploitation of the Queensland trade, inimical
to the interests of the State, should any
person or combination take advantage of
it, and recommended the erection of public
abattoirs at all suitable Queensland ports
to ensure adequate prevention of undue
control. The Government of the day
adopted the recommendations, and had
plans prepared and sites gazetted for the
construction of the works; then the Euro-
pean War happened, and all surplus Aus-
tralian meat was commandeered for the
British Government and attention was
naturally diverted to winning the war.
The Bulletin’s contention as to the
futility of Commissions is, however, exempli-
fied, as nothing has since been done
to carry the recommendations of the Meat
Commission of 1914 into effect. There are
not any public abattoirs throughout Queens-
land, and its meat trade stagnates. Another
Commission has recently been appointed to
go over the same ground. The Common-
wealth and also all the southern States
have recently appointed Commissions or
committees to report on the same subject.
Their combined efforts should bring forth a
mountain; but, after all, it may be only
a mouse. Yours, etc., — Geo. E. Bunning.

The Half-Caste.
It has taken the- Royal Colonial Institute
a long time to realise that the world has
seen a great change, but if oas made the
plunge at last and will be known in future
as the Royal Empire Society. The old
title prevented lots of people from becoming
members, not only in Australia, but in
parts of the Empire which are still actually
“colonies,” though many of them are be-
ginning to feel their muscles and talk about
self-government. Such a one is the Straits
Settlements, which now has an advisory
council sitting at Singapore with members
representing the Indian, Chinese and even
Eurasian communities.
That the lastnamed should have their
rights recognised shows how much the war
has shaken things up. The average English-
man can have a fellow-feeling, more or less,
for a full-blooded Tamil, but hitherto he
has been unable to regard the half-caste
as really human. When he advertises for
a clerk he carefulty differentiates between
the wages to be paid to a white man and a
Eurasian, and you could not insult him
worse than by inviting him to sit down to
dinner with even a cultured shandygaff.
Yet half-castes enlisted from all parts of
the Empire for the Great War and no
stories of running away circulated round
them as they did round Indian mercen-
aries.
Although everything is done to disguise
it, the mixed bloods are multiplying in all
those parts of the Empire which are rightly
described as “colonies.” In most outports
they outnumber the whites and, as in ancient
Asiatic Portugal and in Java to-day, the
half-white will eventually carry the white
man’s burden—if he doesn’t decide to drop it.

Women and the Newspapers.
“Country Pel” : Studying reading habits
I found that girls begin to take an interest
in the daily newspaper at a much later age
than boys. In his twelfth year the normal
boy becomes interested in the news of the
world as read at the breakfast table; and
his first concern is with the daily record of
fatalities and accidents. Of course this is
merely another example of the savage lurk-
ing in us all, but more on the surface in
pre-adolescent years.
On the other hand, girls of the same age
never look at the newspaper, although they
read more books than the boys. It is not
until a girl is about 15 that she begins to
examine newspapers, and then she com-
mences by reading the births, deaths and
marriages advertisements. And this trait
persists right through life. The average
woman in her regard for the newspaper does
not go much higher than these and similar
records. The cablegrams, special articles,
political columns and the leaders have no
interest for women. Reports of a famous
murder trial or a startling divorce case will
enthral them; otherwise they devote them-
selves to accounts of weddings, dress reports
of fashionable race meetings or Government
House receptions and so-called society
gossip, plus the puff pars, from the theatrical
and movie publicity agents and the dis-
play advts. of the shopping emporiums and
the beauty specialists.
Can women boast of their freedom from
the thraldom of the centuries—their wider
outlook on life—when the very newspapers
that cater for their d&ily reading thrive on
such sorry records?

Mush.
So much is heard of the mealy-mouthed
methods of American justice that it comes
as a pleasant surprise to hear that at least
one American official has refused a hystero-
humanitarian appeal to pardon two par-
ticularly villainous murderers. The official
was Governor Al. Smith of New York, a
probable candidate for the Presidency, a
fact that makes his attitude all the more
remarkable. The convicted persons were
a lady and a tertium quid, who had par-
taken in the cold-blooded butchery of the
lady’s husband. Smith’s attitude is a pleas-
ing set-off to the pseudo-humanity which
nowadays seems to be afflicting most civi-
lised peoples. There is quite a lot of it
in Australia, where Judges inflict ridiculous
sentences on persons convicted of the most
brutal crimes on old men and women, and
where Labor Governments consistently
refuse to carry out the law. Sydney has
been terrorised for some months by a
number of morons who slash the faces and
bodies of their victims with razors, the
attack being launched without warning, and
usually from behind. The feat calls for
little display of action and no sound, so the
criminal is out of sight before the onlooker,
or even the victim, realises what has hap-
pened. Difficulty of securing arrest and
conviction in these cases has been great,
and this has been increased by the terrorism
exercised by the razor-wielders over their
contemporaries and associates, kept quiet
themselves by fear of disfigurement.
The first thing to be done is to make it
an offence punishable with 12 months’ gaol
to be found in possession of such a weapon.
For a second offence the birch should be
used. The remedy of a flogging is notori-
ously a queller of crimes of this type; but,
as usual, the mere suggestion has brought
the humbugs out in full cry. The callous
inhumanity of the remedy has shocked
people who do not stop to consider the
amount of inhumanity involved in dis-
figuring people for life, many of them girls
and women. There can be no logical objec-
tion to scarifying the back of a young gentle-
man who has scarified the countenance of
another person, and that without taking the
precaution of having a doctor and several
officials present. Much use has been made
of the old argument that flogging never
does any good; but there is many a mother
who knows better. What good is the
habitual razor-slasher before he is flogged,
anyway?
♦
A Tooth for a Tooth.
A passion for artificial dentures appears
to be sweeping over the community. Is it
that the offending molars are no longer
amenable to conservative treatment; or
are hygienic and preventive measures
honored nowadays more in the breach than
the observance? If it be a iact that all
the faulty teeth of to-day are fit only to
be cast into outer darkness, should not
some earnest effort be made to discover the
basic cause of this premature decay?
True it may be that many a man digs
his grave with his teeth. Equally true is
it that his grave will be less dishonorable
if it be dug with his natural upper and
lower sets. For the premature decay of
any organ bespeaks either carelessness or
ignorance. It is only a generation or
so since the musketeer had perforce to
bite on the cartridge before inserting it
into the primitive breech. Accordingly the
recruit had to be almost dentally perfect
to be accepted for service. To-day his
descendants have too often to content
themselves with masticating at a pressure
of 14-171 b. to the square inch in lieu of a
natural 60-701 b. What deleterious effect, if
any, may there be on the bodily health of
those who labor under the grinding burden
of false teeth?
While absorption from infected teeth, and
their sockets has been rated a menace to
well-being, the question has still to be
answered what the effect may be of an
imperfectly masticated diet.
While the lay and medical public are
intrigued with the minatory prevalence of
cancer to-day, speculating, theorising, ex-
perimenting, searching every nook and
cranny for the cause, so as to find the cure,
a sub-committee might well be formed to
try to discover why we are called upon to
sacrifice more teeth and more prematurely
than our ancestors did.

“Blue Water”: Randolph Bedford (B.
5/l/’2B) wanted to know what the “inter-
national prestige” was that England pos-
sessed but America didn’t. Mr. Curtis D.
Wilbur, U.S. Navy Secretary, both answers
Mr. Bedford and tells us why Uncle Sam’s
new navy is to be built. Wilbur says:
“Smart-looking modem cruisers create a
prestige that aids merchants and manu-
facturers building up trade abroad, and a
measure of commercial success is influenced
in no small degree by the prestige which
up-to-date smart-looking cruisers create and
foster.” A frank statement that America
is going after foreign trade with, a navy in
support! This is, of course, putting the
cart before the horse if British Empire
history means anything. England had the
trade first and evolved a protecting navy
second. America proposes to reverse the
process. Thanks to Mr. Wilbur, we now
know exactly where we are.

POLITICAL
POINTS
In 1925-26 Australia, with its six million
population, was Uncle Sam’s eighth best
customer, but it ranked only 21st on the
list of 33 countries from which Uncle
bought things. This exceedingly one-sided
trade is Australia’s own fault, and Aus-
tralia should repair the fault, as it is quite
unable to afford one of such dimensions.
Uncle’s own Fordney Tariff shows how the
thing could be done.
If a Nationalist Ministry were in power
in Vic., railway freight rates would certainly
have been increased from about October last
to meet the big deficit that is threatened. But
Opposition-leader Hogan, speaking at Ballan
nearly 11 months ago, when the chances of
his becoming head of a Government were
slender, declared against higher rail charges,
and Premier Hogan is hobbled by that
stupid, vote-hunting pledge.
Though the Tas. Parliament two months
ago gave Premier Lyons authority to trip
to London, there are indications that the
jaunt will not be undertaken until after
the general election, some months ahead.
And, of course, if the Government fails to
hold its slender majority (16 to 14), the
trip will be declared off altogether. Many
predict that the election will result in a
dead-lieat. If that happens, and if neither
party is willing to supply a Speaker, Hobart,
and not London, will become the most excit-
ing spot in the Empire for Lyons.
It is a time of small, hard economies, and
the S. Australian Railway Commissioner
has decided on spasmodic suspensions of
work at the Islington workshops in order to
save enough wages to pay the increases which
Arbitration Judge Quick ordered so gaily.
Something of the kind was inevitable, for the
Treasurer said that revenue was falling and
he could find no more money. The Judge
is about as popular at Islington now as a
crocodile would be.
Whoever named the Government auxiliary
ketch which potters round the Northern
Territory was a wag. She is known as
Maskee, which, in the jargon of the China
coast, means “Why worry?” or “It doesn’t
matter.” “Maskee” should be printed on
the N.T.’s coat-of-arms.
The Baldwin Government’s reverse in
Northampton, once represented by Bradlaugh
and Labouchere, ought to make it think more
kindly of preferential voting, to which it
has hitherto been opposed. Its nominee got
14.616 votes, an independent Baldwinite
scored 1093, a Laborite collected 15,173 and
a Liberal’s total was 9584. The Labor man
was elected. Under the system in force at
Commonwealth elections he would have had
to poll a clear majority, and it would have
been long odds against his securing the
5000-odd Liberal preferences required.
Vic. Parliament costs £93,000 a year,
including £12,000 for printing. The Assem-
blymen demand an increase in salary,
and if only £125 extra apiece is given,
Ministers in both Houses sharing, the outlay
will reach £lOl,OOO. It is a lot of money for
a country which was promised a substantial
reduction in State Parliamentary expendi-
ture as a result of Federation.
The State statisticians, talking over things,
find that Australia is going into pawn faster
even than the figures suggest. Steadily our
imports exceed our exports, though our ex-
ports ought to be millions more, seeing that
they have also to pay the interest bill; but
now, it seems, our export total, though hor-
ribly insufficient, is bloated by inclusion of
exports at the home price and not the often
much-lower sale price abroad.
At the recent conference of the Federated
State Teachers’ Unions held in Perth, the
teaching of sex hygiene was discussed, and,
as always, the proposed recommendation was
killed. The usual asinine argument was
that such teaching could not be well carried
out in mixed classes. No one who has given
thought to the subject would suggest such a
thing. The other argument was that this
training was best left to the parents. The
trouble is that parents don’t, and won’t, and
often can’t. So we condemn our childreu
to receive their knowledge of sex in the
present degenerate fashion —whispered from
behind the hand among themselves, and
worse.
The Bavin Government will put on the
neglected garment of its N.S.W. predecessor
as soon as Parliament meets, and install,
through the Savings Bank, a system of advan-
ces for the building of homes up to 90 p.c.
of cost. If it can
be done on a very
large scale it
should blow out
the second mort-
gage at 10 p.c. and
the financiers who
buy second mort-
gages at a big dis-
count. -The pre-
sent system,
largely a product
of the Fair Rents
law, is for the
man with £lOO
and a craving for
a £lOOO house to
give a mortgage
for £6OO at 7 p.c.,
and a second one
for £4OO at 9 or
10 p.c. to the
builder, which
document the
builder trades off
at £3OO. Thus the
buyer’s £lOO van-
ishes to begin
with. The new
idea is philan-
thropic, and if the
shacks are sound
an d not greatly
overvalued, and a
slump doesn’t
come too soon or
too hard, the
losses may not be
large.
Australia has
been supplied with
its trade figures
for five months to
Nov. 30, and the
results are as
usual. Reckoning
the surplus of
imports (nearly
11 millions) which
the exports didn’t
pay for, and the
interest, etc.,
which they didn’t
pay for either, the
country went
about another
£26,000,000 into
debt, and unless
there is a com-
plete reversal of
form there is no
visible end to the
silly, helpless pro-
cess till the bailiff
is put in. The
trade and loan situation calls urgently for
one of Prime Minister Bruce’s Royal Com-
missions, but he seems to have one to spare
for every subject except this.
The usual unemployed deputation waited
on Buttenshaw, of the N.S.W. Ministry,
and asked that he should start work or
resume work on
The Wvangala water scheme, the Grafton-Kyogle
railway, the Casino-Bonalbo railway, the Tempe-East
Hills railway, the St. Leonards-Eastwood railway,
and roads or bridges or something at Tom Ugly’s
Point, Razorback, Pieton, Wiseman’s Ferry, Parra-
matta, Hawkesbury River, Cook’s River, etc.
It would be infinitely more to the point if
unemployed deputations were to pound de-
moniacally on the doors of Bruce and Page,
and bid them put an embargo on a lot of
imports, as has been done with sugar, and
create productive work that way. The
prohibition of sugar imports has furnished
a heap of employment.
The marine stoppage which was on is off,
or mostly off, again. Walsh and Johanson
(both imported) now love each other much
as Stalin and Trotsky do. Walsh told the
Australian seamen to end the quarrel, while
Johanson told them to keep it going. There
was very little to quarrel about, and the
owners, when held up, now exhibit a fatal-
istic readiness to put their ships into cold
storage and stop paying wages, which
creates a difficult situation, so Walsh’s
advice was taken. The struggle to live up
to the Navigation Act, which involves pay-
ing the highest wages, and carrying the
biggest crews, and furnishing them with the
best accommodation, and observing about
100 awards, and coping with the perennial
stoppages, makes it a matter of diminishing
importance what happens to the ships.
Considering all the loan money that has
been spent somehow, N. S. Wales is singu-
larly deficient in Government school and
hospital accommodation and the like. Dis-
closures about a death in the Lidcombe State
Hospital prompted two of Bavin’s Ministers
to visit the institution, and these were among
the things they found: —
In the epileptic ward ICI patients were crowded
together in a section with accommodation for 92.
In the main portion of the ward with accommodation
for 40 men there were 35 others. Many of the
patients were helpless, and were lying on mattresses
placed on the floor between the beds. The hospital
was seriously understaffed. Many of the buildings
were in a dilapidated condition and unsuitable.
This abode of preventable misery is in the
ALL SET.
“With the general election in prospect, the Bruce-Pages publicly announce
the renewal of the pact.”
THE STARS: "Up with the curtain—we are ready now!"
State electorate represented by ex-Premier
Lang. Before the reversion to single seats,
Bruntnell, the present Col. Sec., was one of
the district members.
The Deputy-Governor of the Common-
wealth Bank returned recently from New
York with an assurance that Uncle Sam
is willing to lend us money at 44 per cent.,
and added:—
There seems to exist a sentimental objection against
our borrowing from America, on the theory that
money borrowed from America means spending it
there.. That, however, is quite a fallacy, because no
such condition is attached to the loans. Banking
conditions exist which would enable the whole pro-
ceeds of a loan to be transferred to London within
24 hours.
Nobody whose opinion is worth having
thought it was a condition of U.S. loans that
the proceeds should be spent in the U.S.
What matters is that great loans are raised
in London or New York, and are spent in
one or other of these places, to meet interest
on old loans and to pay for imports which
are not covered by sufficient exports. It
isn’t the duty of a Commonwealth Bank
official to put a good face on this lOU boom
and tell people that it may not be so bad as
they think.
Tasmanians are wondering how Atkinson,
M.11.R. for Wilmot, will fare under the
Bruce-Page election agreement, the first
clause of which reads:—
That a seat held by a member who is a Govern-
ment supporter should be contested by a candidate
representing the party now holding the seat, and
that the other party should assist his candidature.
Atkinson sat in four Parliaments as a
Liberal, became a Nationalist in 1917, and
joined the Country party just before the
1922 election. Rewarded with a post in the
Ministry, he was re-elected as a Cocky in
1925, but was dropped from the Ministry
in June, 1926, and was back in the National-
ist party-room a few months later. If Tas.
Cockyism still exists there will be a glorious
wrangle as to which is “the party now hold-
ing the seat.”
In its efforts at economy the Vic. Gov-
ernment has made a grab at the Railways
Institute. The long building in Flinders-
street, Melbourne, is not only a club, which,
incidentally, produces several new Austra-
lian plays every year; it is a preparatory
school for railmen, where last year 3415
pupils were trained at the moderate cost of
£3522. Its library of technical literature
is better patronised than the Public
Library. But it is apt to teach content-
ment, as well as efficiency, to unionists, so
union bosses of the “take and hold” de-
scription loathe it.
A cabled story of the invention, by a Rus-
sian in England, of a process for treating coal
had tacked on to it some remarks about the
inventor:—
Before the war he was a consultant oil expert
with the Shell and Anglo-Persian companies. He
made a fortune of £BO,OOO, which he invested in
Russian oilfields.... Bolshevik revolutionaries con-
fiscated his property and sent him to gaol. He was
three times sentenced to death, but each time
reprieved at the last moment. Ultimately the Bol-
sheviks employed him to perfect a carbonisation
process in the Moscow gasworks. He escaped to
England penniless in 1921, through the aid of the
British Foreign Office.
Australia would be like that if the Red ele-
ment could get, and keep, control. The un-
reasoning hatred towards the Men Who
Know How, on the theory that they repre-
sent the “bourgeoisie” or the “capitalists,”
amounts to a mania, and the scientist who
lingers with them at the gasworks is lost.
After a visit to the Titles Office, which
Slater controls, Vic. Works Minister Jones
spoke indignantly about the way in which
officers, particularly the skirted clerks, were
accommodated. On the following day a man
in his own department lured him to an
upstairs room where the thermometer, in
spite of electric-fans, was registering 100° in
the shade. Jones gave the victims permis-
sion to go home for the rest of the after-
noon.
The working of short-time at the Isling-
ton railway workshops recalls a time when
South Aus. had to look round for even
smaller economies than that. Robert Hom-
burg, afterwards Judge, when he became a
Minister for the first time made a stir by
writing a memo, to the effect that magnum-
bonum pens were far too expensive to use in
the public offices, and that cheaper nibs must
be substituted. We'll have to get back to
that point before we’re out of the wood.
The rural dominies of N.S.W. are to
meet the Minister in conference. They
might well talk about the subject of re-
movals. These cost annually a very large
sum. When a vacancy occurs, especially in
the higher branches, a chain of removals
takes place, so that a man finds himself
promoted to a distant centre after, say, 12
months in charge of a school. This is
absurd. If a man receives promotion he
ought to justify himself before he gets
another. An alternative method for cutting
down removal expenses might be for the
department to consider the question of fur-
nishing teachers’ residences.
Snowball, Speaker of Vic. Assembly, is
keen on reading the Lord’s prayer at the
beginning of every sitting, like the Chamber
over the way. He broached the subject before
the House went into recess, but Chief Sec.
Prendergast successfully objected to leave
being given for a motion without notice. The
records show that five attempts have been
made since 1856 to have prayer as a pro-
logue to each sitting, but Snowball is not dis-
couraged.
The U. S. Congress lately opened a new
session, and 6000 bills were introduced. One
of them provided that the law should fall
with a thud on persons who disturbed the
peace by using “loud and unusual tones”
while conversing in Washington city. If it
passes, the Court will doubtless have gramo-
phone samples of customary American toues
for purposes of comparison. Cabinet Minis-
the United States aren’t members of
either House, so they can’t tell the local
Badly or Horsington what they think of him.

“C.Q.”: F. Chapman, the Commonwealth
palaeontologist, put a dish out when the red
rain fell in Melbourne, and figured that
the dust amounted to 351 tons to the square
mile. An industrious newspaper correspond-
dent thereupon went further and, estimating
that the area covered was in round figures
25,000 square miles, found that the total
amount of Central Australia transported to
Victoria fell little short of 600,000 tons.
Under ordinary human conditions this would
require 1500 trains of 20 trucks each, each
carrying 20 tons, and the trains would have
to travel well over 1000 miles a trip. One
could not have a more vivid example of what
natural forces can do in their gradual way.
The deposit was only a thin film, but it was

“Kerys”: It was in a crowded Marrick-
ville (Sydney) tram that I saw chivalry crop
up in a very modern form. An old lady in
boarding the vehicle slipped on the high step
and stumbled heavily into the compartment,
whereat two overdressed young women
laughed callously. While the other passen-
gers expressed their opinion of the giggling
by silent resentment, a youth of about 19,
who had given the old lady his seat and
escorted her to the pavement when she
alighted, evidently felt that the situation
warranted something more drastic. Chasing
the moving tram he hopped on to the step,
dealt each offending young woman a stinging
slap in the face, and remarked as he swung
off, “You take that! I've got an old mother

“X.D.”: The sudden-temptation plea will

therein 70 pairs of stockings, 60 boxes of face
powder and 30 frocks.

“Sea Speck”: “Tasmaniac’s” white man
who lived with the blacks (B. 22/12/’27)
was a grandson of Admiral John Jervis, who
walloped the Spaniards off Cape St. Vincent
in 1797 and was made Earl St. Vincent
therefor. The grandson, a lad
of 17, deserted from the ship
Flying Fox —there was a tradi-
tion that an avaricious relative
had shipped him off from Eng-
land to get him out of the way
and that the lad had reason to
believe his life was in danger if
lie stayed on the ship. Any-
how. he lived with a tribe of
blacks for 10 years, and ab-
sorbed most of their bushcraft.
A settler in the north of the
island named Cox ultimately
induced him to leave his dusky
friends, and from that time for-
ward the wanderer was. known
as Sammy Cox. He gained his
livelihood by hunting kangaroo
and selling the meat to the
settlers. In later years he took
to doing up gardens and other
odd jobs. He never married
or was heard to express any
desire to return to England.
When he was quite an old man
he worked for me as gardener
and yardman, and I still have
in my possession his old spade
and rake and the canvas bag in
which he kept his vegetable seeds. He left
me to end his days in the Launceston Invalid
Depot, where he died in 1891 at the reputed
age of 117 years.

managed to get a berth on the same boat, and
when the bridegroom was promenading the
deck with his bride the second day out he
was horrified to find the jilted lady con-
fronting him. She passed him with a few
remarks sufficiently pertinent and audible to
awaken the interest of the near-by passen-
gers. Thereafter the voyage became a sort
of purgatory for the married couple, as the
vengeful one recited her w r oes to sympa-
thetic hearers at great length. When the
unhappy bridegroom caught the flash of a
piece of paper he didn’t need to be told
that it was one of his letters under criti-
cism ; when he saw a group of women
intrigued with feminine garments he realised
than an unused trousseau was being handed
round for sympathetic inspection. By the
time Australia was reached the ■ bride was a
nervous wreck, and upon hearing that the
jilted lady intended to cap her persecution
with a breach-of-promise case she insisted
on a private settlement. The girl collected
the solatium and immediately married a well-
to-do Australian farmer who had been a
fellow-passenger.

“M.G.S.”: “Dr. Nil” (B. 12/l/’2B) for-
gets that, although it is true no single bird
can harmonise, a number should be able to
do so, if they are the “feathered choristers”
of the poets’ sloppy phrase. “Scot Kay’s”
statement that Henry Tate’s “Dawn” con-
sists of nothing but bird noises leaves me
wondering whether he would find nothing
but the sounds of cartwheels and thunder-
storms in Beethoven’s Sixth or of osculations
in his Fourth.

“8.-Gar” : It was when the 2nd Light
Horse Brigade band were giving a concert
in the village of Wadi-Hanien, Palestine, that
Bluey, the headquarters cook, tendered an
item that wasn’t on the programme. He
made a dramatic entry, full of cognac and
riding a commandeered ass, and, pulling his
steed on to its haunches, bawled out, “Is this
Wirths’ Circus, ’cause if it is I’ll show you
the bounding jockey from —-—.” He got
no further, two kindly “Jacks” escorting the
would-be performer and his mount to the
guard-tent. Bluey’s offsider cooked the
breakfast for a week.

“Spinner”: I don’t know why “Simon’s”
old woman who stole stockings to keep her
shrunk legs warm (B. 29/12/’2T) didn’t get a
spinning wheel and a pair of hand “cards,”
together with a few handfuls of wool,
spin the wool into yarn, and knit herself
something better than she could buy in any
store. It is an easy process enough; after
about 20 minutes’ instruction, I, a common
old bush cocky, went home, made a wheel,
bought a pair of cards, and in a short time
my wife and I had socks, stockings, under-
shirts, shawls and, finally, blankets all of
our own manufacture. We breed the sheep,
shear the wool, spin it into thread, and
knit it up. With all the wool and women
in Australia, spinning-wheels ought to be as
plentiful as blackberries.

“Black Tracker” : An Adelaide man who
recently returned from the W.A. goldfields
with a tidy wad did most of his prospecting
in disused houses and decaying settlements.
He began his curious but highly remunerative
quest in Coolgardie, locating various tumble-
down shacks that had been used as sly grog
shops and houses of ill fame in the roaring
’nineties. Often he struck a dud, but in
other cases he made some fine hauls. In a
partition wall he found five Bank of England
£lO notes, probably hidden for safety; in
another habitation of dubious antecedents he
happened on a lolly-tin containing nuggets
which brought £lBO. He also bought the
framework of several long-abandoned hotels,
but they did not yield anything out of the
common. Later he prospected Kalgoorlie
with satisfactory results; in one old house
he found a cellar where much gold must have
been illicitly dealt with and that so care-
lessly that a clean-up resulted in a tidy
parcel being gathered.

“Iverys” : It isn’t only in the “dry” areas
of Maoriland that the hardened toper will
find a substitute for spirituous liquors. One
old busliman of my acquaintance used to
brew himself a beverage consisting mainly o ;
vinegar and cayenne pepper, while _ another
patronised Worcester sauce mixed with pain-
killer. In some parts the übiquitous pain-
killer used to be known as “bushman’s
whisky.” On one large station where I
once earned a crust was a youthful jackeroo
who had been packed away to the country
to wean him from whisky. The missus
spent a whole morning searching for a large
bottle of eau-de-Cologne valued at a couple
of guineas. Its fate was only elucidated
when young Bibo was found in a peaceful
slumber with the empty bottle of perfume
beside him.

T. THE R.


“Frank Jay”: The wandering
Australian bumps up against
Australiana in the most unex-
pected places. During the last
international yacht race off New
York, in 1920, when the Ameri-
can Resolute downed Tommy
Dipton’s Shamrock, I “did” the
race from the air for the Inter-
national News Service. For
five days from the vicinity of
Sandy Hook we spat a running
news story all over the conti-
nent. On one of those days
engine trouble compelled our
pilot to descend at the mouth
of the Shrewsbury River in New
Jersey. A strong tide was run-
ning out, so we taxied up to a
houseboat and made fast. The
craft to my surprise carried the
name “Bungaree” on her stern.
“Where did you get that name?”
I shouted to the occupant of the
craft. “Where I got the boat,
from my uncle,” he shouted
back. Then he dropped into his
dinghy and came alongside our
seaplane for a yarn. He told
me that his uncle, long since
dead, had made a fortune on the
Australian gold-diggings and
had fought in a battle called
“The Euraka.” Later his rela-
tive settled in New Jersey,
bought a farm and built a couple
of boats. The other was the
“Burrumbeet,” which was
parked four miles up the river.
He also showed me a heavy gold
ring made of Ballarat metal,
and added that his uncle’s name
was Barrett. The name touched
some chord in my memory, and
I found myself recalling that
when I was a kid in South Aus-
tralia my father, who was also
in the Eureka scrap, used to
show me an old faded picture
taken at Melbourne in the
’fifties of himself and a gold-
fields mate named Tom Barrett.
After three-quarters of a cen-
tury there is no means of check-
ing up, but I have a hunch that
the man who built those boats
on the Shrewsbury was dad’s
old mate.

“Toonooba”: “Bouragi” ex-
aggerates when he throws open
a fairway 100 miles wide be-
tween Australia and New
Guinea (B. 5,/l/’2S). The
point-to-point distance, mea-
sured on the Admiralty Chart,
is 81 miles. But the northern
waters of Torres Strait, for
more than 60 miles, are so en-
cumbered by an intricate series
of coral reefs, charted and un-
charted, that the suggested pos-
sibility of a passage by the
(Wolf, to say nothing of a squad-
ron, is far-fetched. Even in
negotiating the surveyed channels in these
waters the navigator’s watchwords are log,
lead and lookout; any attempt to navigate
the northern maze would be far more perilous.
Even if the fort at T.I. were only 150 feet
above sea level, the sensible horizon would
be distant 14.1 miles; this would be ample
to bring under surveillance vessels negotiating
the recognised route through the strait.
* * * *
“Momokeni”: The coral-built church at
Fyfe Bay, Papua, is another that contains
some grim relics of the bad old days of
rapine and cannibalism. Pulpit, lectern and
penitents’ bench are all constructed of the
timbers of the last war canoe used by the
Fyfe Bay natives. This quaint gift to the
mission was made by the natives themselves.
To sit alongside hoary-headed old natives
who will sometimes hint at the times when
that same timber was soaked in human blood,
and when they, as youngsters, savored the
taste of human flesh, and watch the mis-
sion cinematograph flash movies on {the
screen to the accompaniment of a gramo-
phone record, makes one realise that Civilisa-
tion has arrived in Papua on seven-league
boots.

“Kerys” Truly there is often more profit
in being mistaken for a shoplifter than in
shoplifting. About a year ago three Sydney
flappers invested in a string of beads apiece
at a well-known emporium, and discarding
the wrappers put the necklaces on and
headed for the nearest picture-show. An
alert house-detective who had seen them
decorating themselves gave chase, with the
result that three protesting damsels saw no
pictures that night, but spent the evening
assuring police and relatives that they had
come by the goods honestly. Nevertheless
the case against them looked rather black
till one, after searching her handbag unsuc-
cessfully a dozen times, turned up the
crumpled scrap of paper that proved their
innocence. Before that happened the girls
had been charged with theft; something
over £4OO was the firm’s final bill of costs
and damages. The necklaces were 9d. each.

“Awani”: Talking of house-to-house ped-
lars (B. 12/1/’2S), the most resourceful I
have met is one of the feminine species. She
closely follows up notices of engagements in
the press and takes a note of the addresses
of newly-affianced young ladies in the
suburbs where she operates. Upon these
households _ she descends at the earliest
moment with her stock of lavender and
frangipanni sachets. She does good business,
too.

“F.J.H.”: Bussy-les-Daours was a pretty
French village near Yillers-Bretonneux,
not quite deserted by the civil population
when we were quartered there, in spite of
intermittent shell-fire from the heavy Ger-
man guns. Walking down the main street
I happened upon two tiny French girls
taking their dolls for an airing in a
dilapidated little pram. The dolls on which
they were lavishing so much attention were
just two bundles of rag. Each was legless
and armless but possessed something that
might have passed for a featureless head.

I enriched their puppets with blue eyes and

more enraptured with the finest doll out of

I met them again next day and each of the
doll-owners very shyly and timidly presented
me with a bunch of flowers.

“Jim Domino”: My record trainload was
not in weight. Coming down with 250-head
of mares and foals from Bourke to agistment
country in the 1920 drought, I received the
shock of my. life at Harden (N.S.W.) when
making an inspection of the train. Quite
half of the foals were minus hair on their
tails, the same having obviously been chewed
right to the butt by their starving com-
panions.
* * * *
“H.F.”: There is no earthly reason why
Australians should drink tea in preference
to coffee, except that the former was more
easily obtainable in the early days. In our
climate tea is a refreshing drink, but unless
you are doing active work, the later effect
of the almost universal tea is depressing
and that in a marked degree. Substitute
fresh roasted coffee berries, grind them just
before making the beverage, and you have
a drink that cheers and keeps you invigorated.
Ground coffee in tins will not do. Try
this: at your lunch drink one day two cups
of strong, tea; note how you feel at three
or tour o clock; repeat the experiment next
day with coffee made as directed and the
difference will amaze you. No country or
individual can go Bolshevik or I.W.W. on
coffee ; that horror is reserved for tea-drinking
melancholy Russians.
* * * *
Cartot : When Old Masters are under
suspicion there is a better way of determin-
ing their age than the test by X- and ultra-
violet rays (B. 12/l/’2B). This consists of
submitting to chemical analysis a morsel of
paint scraped off the canvas. In the
periods when most of the great painters
flourished the pigments which they used
were mostly made from formulae whose con-
stituents and proportions are known.
Thoroughgoing fakers might, of course, try
to imitate the old paint as well as the old
picture, but many of the materials which
were used as pigments three or four hundred
years ago are to-day unprocurable. Doubts
concerning the ages of pictures have in
several recent cases been cleared up by the
chemist, and some of the leading art
societies of London and Paris have honorary
analysts in their membership.
* * * *
“Hayband”: When I started shaving a
bushman showed me the proper way to hone
a razor. “Lay it flat,” said he, “and hone
the back; the edge will hone itself. And
strop it the same way.” I followed his
advice, and from that day to this my razors
have been sharp enough to cut a crocodile’s
throat. Still, I never had an easier shave
than I experienced recently with a home-
made razor that had once been a German
bayonet. Its owner, a returned man minus
a leg, earns his livelihood travelling about
the country razor-honing and scissors-sharp-
emng. First with a file and later with
fane emery he had put an edge on the enemy
weapon that made its touch like the caress
of a butterfly’s wing.

“Arradni”: The steamer Ivoombana was
fitted with wireless about October, 1911, and
carried the installation on her last voyage a
few months later (B. 15/12/’27). It is <mn-
erally assumed that no signals of distress
were sent out, as Cocos Island radio station
was then in commission. It was well within
range, too, and maintaining a continuous
watch. Perth radio would be badly screened
from any vessel m the vicinity of Port Hed-
land.. ihe chances are that the Koombana
ran into a cyclone and foundered before any
call could be made. The first ship to be fitted
; out with wireless in Australian waters was
; the Levuka in 1911. Practically all the
coastal liners were equipped by the end of
that year or early in 1912.

“Chev.”: The people behind the Safety
First campaign in Melbourne have put a lot
of vigor into making the motorist realise
the necessity of periodically attending to his
brakes, but there is one young man they
didn’t reach, apparently. He was discovered
to be driving a motor-cycle without any
brakes at all!
* * * *
“Ledrew” : At Evans Head (N.S.W.) during
the holidays the surf club roped off a section
of the beach for their sports with the inten-
tion of charging a shilling for admission.
They were a bit late, however, in posting
the tollmen, with the result that the area was
sooii packed with non-paying guests. There-
upon the astute officials despatched a member
of the surf club to the mouth of the river
to stage a little diverson. When the alarm
was raised, the life-savers rushed the reel
to the danger zone and the rescue was car-
ried out in stirring style. The deadheads
hurriedly evacuated the roped-in area to see
the rescue, and when they returned found
the officials waiting to receive their shillings.
“Served the mean cows right,” was the
general verdict.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: Civilisation nowhere betrays its
feet of clay so much as in the way it con-
ducts its postal business. Among the trophies
retrieved from letter-boxes in Melbourne dur-
ing the Christmas rush were handbags,
gloves, spectacles and even a set of false
teeth. All had presumably been popped into
the slot by tlieir owners in mis-
take for postal packages.
* * *
“Chevroford”: Melbourne
has a right to be proud of its
holiday crowds. The city’s sea-
side playground consists of a
narrow strip of sand edged with
a narrower fringe of stunted
shrubs and ti-tree. On New
Year’s Day this attenuated plea-
sauuce was packed for 20 miles
with men, women and kids. If
the dressing-sheds provided by
the somnolent beach councils
had been multiplied 20 times
they couldn’t have accommo-
dated half of them. Yet Mr.,
Mrs. and Miss Demos were
as scrupulous in their behavior
under their overwhelming diffi-
culties as so many archbishops.
The flappers took turns in clam-
bering into prickly bushes to get
into their bathing togs, while
tneir young men held up coats
or blankets to shield them from
the prying eyes of any social
reformer who might be passing.
Three men performed miracles
of jugglery with a motor rug
in preserving their modesty in
the middle of a picnic-party.
And at the moment the town is
placarded with the posters of a
certain weekly, “Nearly Nude
Bathing Party.” One can
always see what one goes out
to see.
* * *
“G.8.L.”: The 29th Inter-
national Eucharistic Congress
to be held in Sydney in Septem-
ber is responsible for the re-
printing in Sydney Freeman’s
Journal of a passage from Car-
dinal Moran’s “History of the
Catholic Church in Australia.”
In this bulky volume, under the
heading of “First Eucharistic
Procession in Australia,” it is
stated that on May 21, 1606, a
great religious ceremony was
organised on Australian soil by
the priests who accompanied the
Spanish navigator De Quiros.
Cardinal Moran, when he wrote
his book in 1876, believed that
the religious ceremonies referred
to had been performed at Port
Curtis, in Queensland. All sub-
sequent researches, however, go
to prove that Quiros never
actually landed on the mainland
of Australia. George Colling-
ridge’s book “The First Dis-
covery of Australia” establishes
conclusively that it was one of
the New Hebrides islands that
formed the site of the religious
festivals of Quiros’s expedition.
This island was named by the
navigator Tierra Australia del
Espiritu Santo (the Land of the
Holy Ghost).
SMOKE FROM THE GALLEY FLUE.

1 ou’ve read of the joys of a sailor’s life
In the clipper days long dead,
YY hen lie cut a quid with his old sheath
knife,
As he yelled farewell to his latest w’ife
From the rail of the fo’c’sle head.
You’ve read how he bent o'er a capstan bar
And heaved with a wild “Yo-ho !”
How the Old Man captured his whisky jar
When the ship was headed for shores afar
Where the .Cape Horn blizzards blow.
When th-e look-out man on a home-bound
craft
Roared “Land on the starboard bow,”
He’d haul on the brace like a man gone daft
And yell with delight, as the wind crept aft,
“There are girls on our tow-rope now.”
Our bards still sing of his life of ease
When the trade winds filled his sails,
How he’d nought to do in those sunlit seas
But sit on the hatch and enjoy the breeze
And whistle to passing whales.
But oft in the shadow of old Cape Stiff
Came the keenest joy he knew—
When, standing the morning watch, he’d
sniff
At the freezing gale till he caught a whiff
Of a smell like boiling glue.
For after a week of uncooked grub,
When the galley stood like a closed-up pub
That mocks at a thirsty crew,
Jack’s greatest thrill was to see, once more,
The old black cook at his galley door,
And smoke from the galley flue.

“Lomkey Ree” : Mount Gambier people do
not worry greatly about the disappearance
of drainage falling into the mysterious hole
at the back of the Town Hall (B.
29/12/’27) ; the whole south-east of S.A. is
on the same wicket, so to speak. The sur-
plus of Lake Cadnite (Frances) goes into a

“Fetching girl — eh? Most engaging eyes I
ever met.”
“M’yes. I noticed they’d got rings round
them.”
runaway hole connected with the lake by a
creek. Similarly all the flood-waters of Tati-
ara Creek (Bordertown) disappear into Poo-
cha hole when the latter is in working order.
What does worry some Mt. Gambier folk is
that the level of the underground water stays
a little higher after every fall. The shaft
sunk beside the Blue Lake from which the
town’s water supply is pumped shows the
rises and falls clearly, and by latest measure-
ments the water in it is 10 feet higher than
when the shaft was sunk 50 years ago. The
apparent geologic explanation is that the
local surface (Mt. Gambier town is, accord-
ing to geologists, built over a great cave
roofed with limestone) is sinking at the rate
of about 20 feet in a century. As the under-
ground water is only about 50 below the sur-
face at present, real-estate agents do not
stress the theory of subsidence.
* * * *
“Mako” : Add Maoriland’s Rotorua to the
places where delving is attended with
peculiar risks. Not long ago a gardening
citizen plunged his spade with great energy
into a trench lie was digging—and paused
in horror as the implement slid from his
grasp into the earth’s interior. There was
a lengthy pause before a faint, distant ring
told that the spade had hit bottom and
decided the gardener to do no more digging
that day. Additional excitement is given
to gardening operations in the thermal town-
ship by the ever-present possibility of
tapping a dormant geyser and receiving a
boiling shower-bath. Another spot full of
unexpected chasms and treacherous under-
ground passages is the Mt. Eden-Mt. Albert
suburban district near Auckland. Under this
land are enormous caves, used once as Maori
burying-places, and underground water de-
posits that rise with mysterious suddenness
and flood the low-lying land. Over all this
honeycombed country the noise of a horse
galloping or a tram approaching at night
can be heard with deceptive plainness miles
away.

“Blue Nose”: A feature of the recent
Annual Cookery Exhibition in London was a
special department purporting to illustrate
the cuisine of the merchant service. The
Duchess of York was reported to be deeply
interested in the duff, the bubble-and-squeak,
bowline hash, cracker soup, and sea-pie. A
good many old salts would be interested, too,
since they would never have heard of some
of these delicacies. And what sort of a
fo'c’s’le menu is it that makes no mention
of hashmagandy or slumgullion?

“Gregor”: The gipsies from the Levant
who hang around the suburbs of Sydney
telling fortunes and purloining anything
portable are in the main greasy nuisances
who should never have been allowed into the
country, and yet
they have a certain
interest as a link
between the mod-
ern world and the
remote beginnings
of civilisation.
Much of the seem-

Galen’s days, often
in a singularly un-
garbled form; it

period when Greek
and Roman phy-
sicians were begin-
ning to lay the
foundations of
modern medical
science. Not long
ago I heard from
an aged gipsy on
the South Coast of New South Wales a cure
for epilepsy in practically the words in which
it was given by Pliny in the first cen-
tury after Christ. Pliny himself probably
had it from an Egyptian source.

“Selma”: The other day a 14-year-old girl,
bathing in shallow water at Stanley Bay, an
Auckland beach, trod on what she thought
was the branch of a tree. When the
“branch” rose and curled itself round her
legs and began to draw her into deep water
she realised she was in the grip of an octo-
~ pus. She screamed for help, and an older
brother rushed to her assistance, to find that
the girl had disappeared, while the water was
discolored with a black fluid. Then a ten-
tacle lashed out and gripped his thigh, but
he managed to tear it off and, seizing his

“FY7”: That N.-W. Queensland story of
the stolen motor-car which was pursued by
an aeroplane over the N.T. border, the car
being recovered and the thieves left to die

ot thirst or return to the waiting arms of the
law in Queensland (B. 12/l/’2B), recalls a
happening in the Bananaland of long ago
which had a very similar ending, though the
conditions of pursuit were widely different.
A small mob of valuable horses was stolen
from a station on the head of the Dawson,
and tracks suggested they had been headed
n.-w. for the Upper Barcoo, some 200 miles
away. A relative of the writer’s, with a black-
boy, went in pursuit of the depredators, three
in number, and after four days ran them
down where they had camped on the out-
skirts of Lansdowne station. Safe, as they
thought, from pursuit, the fugitives turned in
after nightfall, merely hobbling their saddle-
horses, while the pursuers watched from
cover. When the three were asleep the puni-
tive party walked into the camp and soon
had the slumberers overpowered and tied up.
Arms, saddlery and rations were piled on the
fire and burned and, the horses having been
mustered, the disconsolate thieves were left
to begin life again from the bottom of the
ladder.

“Vera K.”: Let me assure “X.N.0.” (B.
29/12/’27) there is nothing wrong with the
P.O. code for transmitting telegrams by
’phone; the one he mentions has been in
use since 1921. I have sent over a good
many, and while our line can be as bad as
the worst, and the operators at the other
end ditto, I have never had the “A” for
Albert mistaken for “Egbert” or “Bob” for
“Lob.” There are nine words in the naval
men’s code identical with the P.M.G.’s, but
the former’s “D” for “Dough” could sound
umpteen different words over the ’phone, and
there are several others equally unreliable.

“Coot” : The dredge Thomas Bent, operat-
ing at Geelong, recently encountered obstruc-
tions. Investigation presently showed that
she was busy with the remains of the famous
clipper Lightning, which was burned off the
pier at Geelong in 1869.- The Lightning was
built in 1853; her first skipper was “Hell
or Melbourne” Bully Forbes, and the almost-
as-famous Bully Bragg was mate. In 1854
she returned to England from her first trip
to Australia in 64 days, a record at that
date. In 1857 she carried troops to India
during the Mutiny, whilst in 1862 she made
a special trip to Port Chalmers (M.L.),
taking diggers to the gold rush at Gabriel’s
Gully. Seven years later she was leading
wool at Geelong and had 4000 bales on board
when fire broke out. An attempt was made
to scuttle the doomed vessel by a bombard-
ment from two 32-pounders. The gunners,
although only 300 yards away, made a poor
job of it, but the clipper sank at sundown.

THE IDEAL TOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Every competitor in the Ideal Town competition
so far has boasted some superlative quality or civic
enterprise, but that of Euroa is different from all the
others. ‘We have the most homely, hospitable, kindly
and amicable folk in Victoria,’ they say. ‘There
hasn’t been a row in the town for years.’ ”—Mel-
bourne Sun.
Let others of scenery sing,
Of climate or social genteelness ;
We count on a weightier thing
To warrant our township’s idealness.
Scan history, sirs, as you will,
t ’Way back, if you wish it, to Noah;
You’ll read there of many a mill—
But never a row in Euroa.
Some prate of municipal halls
And towns that are models of mapping,
But what of municipal brawls
And citizens privately scrapping?
The virtue whereon we rely
Elsewhere is extinct as the moa;
Our censors we roundly defy
To point to a row in Euroa.
They tell of a bit of a scene—
’Twas ’way back in seventy-seven—
When hot-tempered Bridget McLean
Was short with old Mrs. Treleven.
’Twas nothing, thank God, but a scare,
They kissed and made up ; but you’ll show a
Nice tact by forgetting that there
Was nearly a row in Euroa.
But, hush! In my breast there’s a plan
I’ve long and most ardently cherished
To dodge the oblivion man
Is fated to once he has perished.
Some citizen’s snout I will tap,
And fame everlasting shall throw a
Bright light upon me —as the chap
Who started a row in Euroa.

*Net funds apart from capital.
The table shows the position after making
various adjustments outside the revenue ac-
count. Last year, for instance, £18,500 was ap-
propriated to establishment; but since it was
all spent in salaries, etc. (£12,500 Ordinary,
£6OOO Industrial), the intangibles remained
the same. Hence the “Wild Cat” has charged
up this expenditure with exes., from which
an arbitrary deduction has been made on
account of £1657 slipped into the deprecia-
tion reserve. The year’s net result was a
surplus of £46,570 compared with a surplus
of £47,681 in the previous term; but a loss
of £SI44 on Industrial business reduced the
amount added to funds to £38,426, making
them £158,258 net. The table needs to be
considered in relation to these figures:—
1924. 1926. 1927.
Ordinary:—
Policies issued. . 3,130 2,800 2,969
Assuring .. £1,679,669 £1,272,277 £1,506,5170
Renewal premiums 80,673 117,330 122,270
First premiums.. 43,850 31,010 36,913
Interest and rent 3,265 7,268 8,809
The contraction in new business written
since 1924 is partly the result of a change
in the method of accounting. A distinctly
pleasing feature is the large proportion of
renewals, the average to date being well
above 80 p.c.; and of the £5,551,771 of busi-
ness, excluding bonuses, in force at Aug. 31,
1926, only about 20 p.c, was endowment.
The average per policy last year was £507
compared with £454, £453, nd £536 in the
three preceding terms. A long run of com-
paratively good seasons and the co.’s associa-
tion with the farmers’ co-operative concerns
have helped it considerably in writing those
satisfactory figures.
When the actuary was called in at the
end of the first quinquennium he measured
up liabilities under Ordinary policies at
£141,291, and under Industrial policies at
£1942. That was at Aug. 31, 1925. A month
earlier the assurance fund stood in the books
at £88,207. To make it cover the liabilities
£55,026 was added to establishment account,
raising it to £72,925, at which figure it still
stands. In. addition a city freehold which
had just been purchased was written up
£34,609, giving it a book value of £90,000,
and the increase was added to the assurance
funds, thus providing a margin against future
increase in policy liabilities. Incidentally the
board has been offered £85,000 for the
property, but says it is worth at least £15,000
more. Assuming that the net surpluses earned
since valuation are equal to the increase in
policy liabilities—and that is by no means
certain —Then, of the £256.527 at which the
assurance fund stood in the books at Aug.
31 last, £34,609 belongs to shareholders, who
could thus see net tangibles with a book
value of Bs. 7d. for every £1 of capital paid
up. That is excluding £15,000 advanced
to the Industrial Department. Here is the
position in detail: —

♦Apart from premiums paid in advance.
The growth of mortgages has been, assisted
by the general tightness of money and the
co.’s property purchase assurance scheme.
New head-office premises are to be built
and the ground floor let as shops. The cost
will be small and the income substantial, the
chairman says.
The co. is one of the most promising of the
young offices, and, provided it can cut costs
back and does not hamstring itself by an
extension of benefits too early, its prospects
are excellent. Following the actuary’s inves-
tigation the board handed out bonuses to
policy-holders, £2 p.c. on whole life and
£1 10s. p.c. on endowment. These were not
earned. The deficiency between policy lia-
bilities and the life fund was £55,026, as
stated above. Nevertheless dividends to share-
holders have been mentioned as a likely event
after the next valuation. What are the pros-
pects? To begin with, there is £86,926 of
goodwill and establishment asking for reduc-
tion before shareholders should come into the
picture, and the £15,000 advanced .to the
Industrial Department should be wiped off
as soon as possible. The office bases its
actuarial calculations on a future net return
of 4 p.c.; last year interest and rents brought
in £BBO9, equal to 3.6 p.c. on the mean funds
apart from capital. As to costs, on the
assumption that the handling of old business
consumes 7-£ p.c. of the renewal premiums,
and charging the balance of the expenses
against new business, the latter cost 240 p.c.
last year, and better than that will have to
bo done. A year ago the co. took over control
of its own affairs in all States ; previously
management was largely in the hands of the
various farmers’ co-op. associations.
The co. gives a good deal of attention to
Industrial business, which has moved in
this way:—
Income. Claims. Exes. Loss.
1923 .. £4,822 £3 £13,070 £8,251
1924 .. 9,884 104 22,666 12,886
1925 ... 12,300 408 24,239 12,347

1927 .. 18,759 1695 25,208 8,144
The income is growing nicely, but exes,
ate 134 p.c. of last year’s premiums com-
pared with 124 p.c. and 197 p.c. in the two
preceding terms. But it is claimed that in
N. S. Wales and Westralia the business is
now’ showing a surplus.

The fire in the co.'s mine is mainly respon-
sible for the drop of £11,205 in the net earn-
ings. The total output (418,152 tons) was
24,676 tons below the previous effort, and
gross profit trom mining (£48.540) was
£15,091 lighter. Costs, of course, tend to
grow as the distance between working faces
and bins lengthens; new regulations added
£2OOO to the year’s overhead, and the general
condition of trade in the Dominion, although
brightening, did not give much help. How-
ever, the steamer, hulks, coke-ovens and the
sawmill brought in £24,774, only £325 less
than in the previous year, and management
and office charges (£39,220) were cut back
£2806. That left net profit at £34,094, just
a little more than enough to pay a 71 p.c.
div. But there is an insurance fund
(£138,579), created to carry risks which the
co. cannot insure outside, which benefits by
the interest earned on investments —the latter
stand in the books at £298,727 —and to which
£21,368 was added before the year’s p. and 1.
figures were written into the sheet, so the
addition is included with profits in the table.
The £55,462 thus netted was 12.3 p.c. on
capital compared with 14.8, 15.1, 10.7 and
13.5 p.c. back to 1923. But with the fire,
which has cost about £16,000 to date, still
on its hands, the board lopped 2J p.c. off the
recent rate of distribution, and the £10,462
that remained made formal reserves £141,079.
The real position is much better than that,
though, as this comparison suggests:—
1924. 1926. 1927.
More or less liquid assets £551,876 £581,773 £558,166
Liabilities . . . . 233,588 258,380 242,293
Surplus £318,288 £323,393 £315,873
Property .. .. 273,824 291,974 297,706
Liquids include a sinking fund of £128,750,
held by trustees. A memo attached to the
accounts says interest paid and accrued
amounts to £72,380, thus making the total
fund £201,130. What the co. does with the
interest is not visible in the figures, but the
principal, at least, is apparently included on
the other side of the sheet amongst sundry
liabilities: the extraordinary size of the cre-
ditor item (£242,293) certainly arouses that
suspicion. If that supposition is correct
shareholders have for every pound of paid
capital over 20s. in more or less liquid form.
In addition there is the property item
(£297,706), equal to 13s. sd. per share, and
the board says that its liberal policy of de-
preciation has not been departed from. Share-
holders are thus in a very comfortable posi-
tion. The management is confident of being
able to cope with the fire problem; at any
rate, there is the new coal property bought in
1926, but beyond preliminary prospecting
nothing has been done there so far.
The market’s opinion is that the £1 shares
are worth 31s. 9d. The return at that price
is 6.3 p.c. while the div. remains at 10 p.c.,
or 7.8 p.c. on a p.c. basis, and appear-
ances are that there is no insuperable diffi-
culty in the way of the latter.

In the March half the Swan swallowed the
business of the Castlemaine of Fremantle,
and paid £72,845 for the meal —£29,090 cash
and the balance in fully-paid shares. At
December, 1925, the assets had been priced
in the vendor’s books at £157,206 net, in-
cluding an unspecified amount of goodwill.
However, the Swan’s visible reserves bene-
fited by only £65,846 ; and to make sure that
the big co.’s chief assets —brewery, plant,
etc. —were not handicapped, they were
promptly written down £22,614, leaving them
in the books at £750,423. That was before
net profit was written into the table, so the
result for the March half was much better
than it looks in comparison with that for the
last half.
A marked expansion of profits has followed
closely on the heels of the deal. The year's
net earnings sprang £24,355, mounting to
£98,861; and after deducting pref. require-
ments (£3OOO p.a.), the balance was 28 p.c.
on the average ordinary capital compared
with 23.2, 21.1, 23.9 and 26.2 p.c. back to
1923. One noticeable result of the absorp-
tion has been a proportionate reduction in
overhead. Exes. (£104,980, up £14,973) took
only 44.8 p.c. of the year’s gross profit
(£234,005, up £58,254) compared with 51.2
p.c. in the previous 12 months. Since Sept.,
1926, the cost of hotel freeholds taken over
was £129,789; that, of course, must mean
bigger turnover. At Sept. 30 last hotel pro-
perties stood in the books at £556,699 less
£65,943 written off to date. A curious
feature of the accounts is that the amount
“written off to date” has decreased £6557
during the year, while on the other side of
the sheet “Accounts in credit, including
goodwills accruing” (£115,368, up. £54,097),
has stepped forward briskly. It is possible
that adjustments may have been made be-
tween these two accounts, and that the latter
is not wholly in the nature of outside debt,
but is in part a reserve.

Including mortgages and stocks the more or

Stocks (£75,112) increased only £13,314,
while book debts (£84,650) grew £24,209.
Since the books were ruled off the co.
bought the Emu Brewery, Perth, for £39,550
in fully-paid 255. ord. shares, equal to
approximately £lOO,OOO at the market price
of the scrip when the offer was made.
At March 31 the vendor’s books showed net
tangibles amounting to £113,955 —capital
£79,100, reserves £34,855. The brewery,
plant and freeholds were in at £118,467,
against which £25,500 had been set aside
for depreciation. Shareholders in the Emu
co. get two Swan ords. for every five of
their pound shares, and they received 15 p.c.
last year. That is to say, 16 p.c. on the
new scrip will be worth no more than 8 p.c.
on the face value of their old holdings, but
the security is better and their prospects
brighter. This purchase gives the Swan co.
practically a monopoly of the trade in West-
ralia, and the present prosperity there,
due to a succession of good seasons and the
rapid development of the pastoral and agri-
cultural industries, makes the co.’s outlook
a very cheerful one indeed.
The market, impressed by the co.’s strong
trade position and its fine pile of reserves,
offers 695. for the 255. ords. At that price
the immediate return is 5.8 p.c. on a 16 p.c.
div. basis, and the backing amounts to 545.
in net tangibles. For the strongly protected
£1 6 p.c. cum. prefs. 19s. is paid, thus
returning the investor 6.3 p.c.

Tlie declared profit was £6llO poorer than
the 1026 figure; and the £40,897 netted was
only 6.1 p.c. on average funds compared with
7.1, 7.8 and 9.7 p.c. back to 1924. To meet
the pref. requirements and hand 10 p.c. to
the ords., capital and reserves as at last
balance have to earn 5.4 p.c. But because
the board was never over-liberal with divi-
dends it has been able to keep the rate steady
and pile up handsome reserves (£256,918).
In view of the poor earning power of funds
in recent years the accumulation has come
in very handy. The margin between earn-
ings and distributions, however, is beginning
to wear an uncomfortably thin look. The
co. publishes a bare sheet, so how gross
profits and exes, are moving it is not possible
to say. But the general trend of profits
exhibited in the table is a common experience
amongst wholesale houses in Australia of
recent years. That is partly because the
big retailer has become his own importer,
and partly because of the growth of the
specialty house and the rise of Australian
factories which deal direct with many re-
tailers. Also the fact that the big whole-
saler is compelled to carry large stocks and
order long distances ahead makes his profits
more sensitive to price fluctuations ianc 1
fashion changes than is the case with the
retailer, who can unload quickly and cut
his loss. Nevertheless, this old-established
softgoods house has some advantages. It
has gone into the manufacturing side of the
business itself, and owns the Torrenside
Woollen Mills, and that should be a help;
also its board consists of men who have
grown up in the business.
The co. is rebuilding part of its Perth
warehouse, and although the work had been
going on for nearly a year only £4502 was
added to the book value of freeholds
(£131,644) ; and the amount coming to
creditors (£361,884) was reduced by £29,734.
That and other movements are visible in this

The more or less liquid surplus (£698,741),
excluding from the liabilities the. 61 p.c.
notes which were issued at £95 with a 20
years’ currency in 1922, dropped £17,629
during the year. Stocks (£695,363), 67 p.c.
greater than the capital, were reduced a
further £44,756, making a total of £122,283
over the last two years; and book debts
(£307,836) expanded only £16,339 in the
past 12 months.
The prefs., which have priority as to
capital and carry a cumulative 7 p.c., are
covered by £4 Is. 7d. in net tangibles, and
last year’s profit was 31 times their annual
requirements. The market, however, is not
impressed with developments in the trade,
and buyers offer only 19s. for the scrip with-
out attracting sellers. The return at that
price is 7.3 p.c. The ords., which are held
mostly in London and by men in the busi-
ness, could see 40s. sd. in net tangibles after
allowing for the prefs.

margins between earnings and present dis-
tributions are narrow. Last year tlie co.
netted 13.7 p.c. on its capital compared with
14 5 11.4, 11 and 10.1 p.c. back to 1920, and
for the past 10 years shareholders have
had not less than 10 p.c., with a little extra
in the fat years. The 1920 capitalisation
was in part a restoration of a writing-off IS
years earlier ] and that was due to the pecu-
lations of employees—which suggests one of
the risks of this business, especially when it
is scattered over many branches.
This comparison shows how the business
is growing and the method by which it is
financed: —

increased the amount of outside money at
risk in the business to 20s. Bd. for every
£1 owned by shareholders. The explanation
of the comparatively heavy debt lies in the
property item, which represents over SO p.c.
of shareholders’ funds. While property
values are on the increase the board's policy
is profitable, as illustrated by the surplus
on the 1924 property sale; but it may mean
a struggle to keep the div. steady should the

So whatever the profit is it will be saved up

The position of copper is a good deal
stronger than it has been for a long while,
and zinc is also looking up. In its end-of-
the-year review of economic conditions, the
great National City Bank of N. York wrote:
Non-ferrous metals are showing a decidedly stronger
tone. Copper in particular has been in active
demand [in the closing months of the year]. Further
increase is talked of as a possibility after the
first of the year.
Higher prices for copper reflect both an increased
demand, particularly from foreign sources, and a
strong statistical position. Domestic consumption,
though off from the record level of 1926, has been
up from that of 1925. Stocks, invisible and visible,
both here and abroad, are low compared with re-
quirements. With no apparent, intention on the part
of producers to increase production, the copper
market appears to be in the best shape for a major
advance in a long period.
Improvement is shared by other non-ferrous metals.
Zinc is up from 5.95 cents to 6.20 cents per lb. on
good demand for first quarter 1928 delivery. Lead,
though still pegged at 61 cents, has been more active,
and tin has advanced from 56.00 cents to 58.374
cents. Steadiness in steel is helping sentiment in
non-ferrous metals, which are expected to benefit
also from resumption of activity in the automobile
industry.

Cyril Emery, who lias charge of the
North’s operations and is almost always tlie
spokesman for the Broken Hill managers,
had another few worrying hours last week
when the top gear of the British was ablaze.
The danger in such a case is. that the fire
will damage a horribly expensive shaft; but
nothing like that happened in this ease, and
a few thousands will cover the cost.
* * * #
Three prospectors recently reported a
silver-lead seam in an did shaft near Con-
dobolin (N.S.W.). A private assay is said
to have shown 60.5 p.c. lead, nearly 3oz.
gold and over 250 z. silver to the ton. The
mine has been christened the Mascot. That
recalls an effort by local promoters to open
up a mine of the same name in the same
district over 20 years ago. Sydney men
found the money, and a few truckloads of
carbonate ore, which hardly paid exes., were
treated at Cockle Creek; then it was decided
that richer stuff was to be had at depth, so
more money was found and the shaft went
down. The next truckload despatched was
of picked sulphides estimated to return £5O
net. The cheque received was for Is. Bd.
Those who then put up the cash got only
experience from their investment. Investiga-
tions subsequently disclosed that the shaft
they had been trying to develop was first
sunk in ISSS. and had been long since
abandoned. Tlie Wild Cat hopes the pre-
sent prospectors will have better luck; but
it also hopes they won’t spend any more
money on the strength of a single assay—or
a dozen assays of picked stone, for that
matter. If high assay returns for silver and
lead .meant wealth, you could pick up a
fortune any day in tlie Day
Dream, Purnamoota and . Apollyon Valley
country outside Broken Hill-
Chairman Leslie Urquhart, of Russo-
Asiatic Consolidated, Ltd., which now holds
a controlling interest in Mt. Isa (Q.), is on
his way to the latter Held, with W. H. Cor-
bonld and technical-adviser D. P. Mitchell.
“The value of the mine is undoubted; there
is no question on the metallurgical or finan-
cial side,” says Mr. Urquhart. “Indications
are tint for every 100 ft. vertical depth of
mine there are 1,300,000 tons of medium-
grade ore.” The problem will be one of costs.
Isa is over 600 miles from port, but the
freight question was apparently settled in
London with Premier McCormack some
months ago. What remains unsettled are
industrial conditions. Under pressure of
buying orders from London bears on the Aus-
tralian market recently found themselves in
an uncomfortable position. After sales at
235. 3d. a little over a month ago the price
rose to 295., but has lately eased to 275. 3d.

Monte Carlo, an Adelaide co. nominally in
possession of the Glenelg Queen leases
(W.A.), is in a position disturbing to the
minds of shareholders. Mine and plant are
mortgaged to two men who advanced the
necessary cash to complete the purchase of
the property, and one of the mortgagees is
managing director of the show. Calls are
being made to pay wages and other costs
incidental to developing the mine, and share-
holders are not satisfied. The remedy may
be painful, but it is apparent. Directors
should make the call necessary to pay oil
the mortgagees and regain control of opera-
tions. True, the future of the mine is by
no means certain. On the one hand the
shoots are short and the ground at 140 feet
is extremely hard; but the stone is rich, and
developments justify an alteration of the
present methods.
sH * * *
New Mararoa, Norseman (W.A.), has
milled 242 tons for 103 oz„ which will hardly
give wages to its three enterprising owners.
The mine had been previously tested, btiL
with indifferent success. Both the New
Mararoa and its neighbor on the north—
the Mararoa—have been subjects recently of
attempted revivals. The Mararoa had a
long div.-paying career, but the New
Mararoa has proved always not quite good
enough. Few could have given the shows
a more thorough trial than their present
owners, but, so" far, little success has been
achieved. Success rarely does come to min-
ing leases as a result of a second trial.
This is not surprising, as the second comers
have a lot against them —unsafe workings,
worked-to-a-finisli plants, rising costs and
what not. If an attempt is really made to
put the Golden Horseshoe in order for a
second run, the man who has the job will
know all about this sort of thing.
* * * *
It will be interesting to note where the
imported geophysical prospecting experts com-
mence operations in W.A. Geologist Arthur
Wade who reported on the prospects ot
striking oil in Nor’-Westralia for the Federa
Government, and State Geologists Blatcliford
and Talbot, all consider there is a reason-
able chance of striking oil in that locality;
and it is generally admitted there is a lair
prospect of a new goldfield being unmasked
by testing the untried auriferous areas. Lut
there are no voters in the Nor-West , so
if the matter is left to the politicians it is
pretty certain that nothing will be done
there. They are far more likely to potter
around old fields.
* * * *
“Prospector”: Now that the rich placer
claims on Edie Creek (N.G.) are showing
signs of being worked out, some of the more
venturesome spirits are going farther afield
and deeper in the mountain ranges; more
especially in the Waria system, inland from
Morobe. The middle waters of this river run
through the Wakai-ia Plains, an extensile
bed of alluvium 2000 ft. above sea-level, part
of which formed the Kempf concession turned
down by Barton a couple of years ago.
Notwithstanding the result of that expert s
examination many local prospectors still
believe in the truth of the original report
made by the German geologist Schultz, and
as the result of it and of recent prospects a
great deal of the lapsed concession has now
been re-pegged by practical men. Antici-
pating mining activity in this area, the
Administration sent Chinnery (Government
anthropologist) to get in touch with the
natives of the watershed not yet under con-
trol. He succeeded in establishing friendly
relations with the mountain tribes of the
Bubu, Ono, Upper Waria, Wa-de and Biaru
or Williams, and returned to the coast by
way of Bulolo and the Gough, Lam-
bert and other prospectors who _ followed
shortly after found friendly natives and
were able to buy native food and engage
guides and carriers. The Wa-de, with its
tributary the Kuberlae, runs past Mount
Lawson, where it becomes the Williams, a
branch of the Lakehamu, well known to
Papuan miners. It was on the Lakekamu
some years ago a valuable field was dis-
covered and a rush took place which could
not be controlled, till a severe outbreak of
dysentery caused the abandonment of the
field, and the whole district was deserted.
The Williams, together with other tributaries
of the Lakekamu, are bound to receive atten-
tion within the next few months; they flow
from the western end of the mountain ranges
whose eastern shed forms the Watut (Edie
Creek) system. Now that the aeroplane ser-
vice is functioning satisfactorily, enabling a
store to be established on the Wau, further
prospecting has been made possible in the
region of the Ivratke mountains, and it is
confidently expected that other fields will be
located.
* * * *
Guinea Gold activities seem to be increas-
ing. The latest report from the Bulolo show
is that the approval of the adminstration
has been given to the granting of additional
ground on the outside boundaries of the
leases held by Guinea Gold South. This is
the first of the block of leases on the Bulolo
River itself, a short distance n.-w. of the
co.’s claims oil Ivoranga Creek and the junc-
tion of the Edie with the Bulolo, and in-
cludes the areas which were recently tested
by T. Horton, in which Territory Invest-
ments are interested. Guinea Gold’s field
superintendent, E. B. Jensen, is due in Adel-
aide this month for a conference with the
directors, when the co.’s programme for 192 S
is to be discussed.

The Bakes Entrance Co. (Vic.) is having
trouble in clearing the water out of its
No. 2 borehole in order to give the gas and
oil freer play. Bailing was started on Jan.
2; the bailers brought from the bottom what
the report calls “nice” oil. The report says
the oil is inclined to collect more freely in the
bore’ and more gas is showing and “seems to
be acting on the oil in a more decided
manner,” whatever that may mean. Three
shifts are working to keep the water down
with the object of further swabbing the hole
for oil. Capital is to be increased from
£40,000 to £OO,OOO in £1 shares, the addi-
tional 20.000 being offered to present share-
holders. The South Aus. Oil Wells Co. has
purchased a lease-application to the north-
west of the borehole, which has been drilled
nearly on the exact spot indicated by H. S.
Byne, the Australian geologist, before he
left for Venezuela three years ago.
# * * *
Taranaki Oil Co.’s luck has changed
slightly after a long run with the wheel
against it. Gisborne borehole No. 2 was
down to 2140 ft. on Jan. 4. Between 2000 ft.
and 2050 ft. samples of the sand gave traces
of oil by the chloroform test. Gas was show-
ing a little lower down in the hole, which
is about to be spudded in. The co.’s pros-
pects on the east coast do not look so much
better than they are on the west coast, north-
east of New Plymouth. There has been no
news of late from Coal Oil (N.Z.), Ctd.,
whose land near Dannevirke, in the extreme
s.-e. of the North Island, is being geophy-
sically surveyed by the Elbof group from
Germany, under Dr. Krahmann.

The Oriomo Co. is searching for oil in the
western division of Papua. The Common-
wealth Government has asked Dr. Richard-
son to make a geological survey of the field,
and the survey is being undertaken by the
Anglo-Persian co. as agents for the Govern-
ment. Dr. Richardson should reach Port
Moresby towards the end of the month, and
if the survey is favorable the co. will be
aided by a subsidy from the Government,
which has undertaken the cost of taking
core samples from the field for examination.
One bore has been sunk 730 feet and another
714 feet. A late report said that a smell
of crude oil is noticed. This suggests a
new idea in geological survey. The time
may yet come when the prospecting co. will
advertise for professional smellers. Or maybe
they will call themselves sniffers.

Malayan tin-dredging returns for the first
fortnight of the New Year are, as usual,
headed by the Alluvial Tin-Pratten groups,
who make a commendable practice of going
to press early, so to speak. Rawaiig, which
averaged .601 b. to the yard for the last three
months of 1927, returned 17 tons from
59,000 yards from the bucket dredge, the
sluicing plant being still unheard of; it has
had a spell since October. The average for
the first half of January is .691 b., a pleasant
lift to record. Malim Nawar, recovering 11
tons from 59,000 yards, averaged close on
.451 b. for the fortnight, the last quarter’s
figure being .471 b. Malim Nawar South,
with 15 tons from 65,000 yards, went ,551 b.,
a drop on the .591 b. average for the previous
quarter. Kundang improved, taking 13 tons
from 50,000 yards, and bettering the last
quarter’s average of .601 b by two points.
Kuala Kampar improved on the December
average with 10 tons from 60,000 yards, an
average of .401 b., as against .321 b. for
December, but drops below the quarterly
figures of ,451 b. Tanjong Tualong continues
to improve, with 20 tons from 70,000 yards,
averaging .681 b., as against .541 b. for
December and .531 b. for the last three
months. Jelapang slipped, with only 10 tons
from 54,000 yards, or an average of only
.441b. This is a sad drop from the quarter s
.631b. The Larut amalgamation was in
much better case, the dredges turning over
156 yards for 46 tons of tin, a handsome
start for the New Year. The average was
.701b., as against .511b. for the quarter, the
last three and a half months showing a
steady increase in average values and output.

Burma Malay, a prospecting and holding
co., was registered in the F.M.S. in 302o,
with an authorised capital of 50,000 £1
shares, of which 30,000 were issued f.p.
15,000 to the promoters —and 20,000 were
held in reserve. Reconstruction has been
found necessary, and a meeting has been
held at Kuala Lumpur (F.M.S.) with that
in view. Capital is to be increased and
further consideration was given to the matter
of the issue of free shares. New articles of
association have been drafted, and these will
be completed as soon as possible, in order
to have the co. listed on the Sydney btock
Exchange. The co. has two subsidiaries, iho
first, launched in November, 1926, is Katu,
formed to work an area near Tongkah Har-
bor, in Western Siam. Katu’s authorised
capital is £160,000 in £1 shares, Burma
Malay receiving 30,000 f.-p. shares and
£40,000 in cash. Of the shares issued 120,000
were offered for public subscription, and
10,000 were held in reserve. Katu’s area is a
trifle over 400 acres, containing 21,300,000
yards, averaging ,871b. of t.o., and with an
average depth of 33ft. It was bored by E. N.
Mulligan, chairman of Burma Malay and a
director of Katu. The dredge, which is ex-
pected to start digging next July, is of
125,000 yards per month capacity, and will
be Diesel-electric in operation. The second
pup, Renong Consolidated, has an authorised
capital of £200.000 in £1 shares. The parent
co. took 35,000 f.p.’s and £30,000 cash for
the property. This consists of some 6o i
acres in the Renong district,, on the west
coast of Siam, and has been estimated to con-
tain 30,600,000 yards, averaging ,721b. of
t.o. per yard. The dredge will be. similar
to that ordered for Katu, and delivery is
expected to begin in February. It is hoped to
start digging by the end of this year.

Australia’s old friend Lord Leverhulme,
the soap Croesus, went to his rest leaving
some strange devices behind him. A sum of
Sydney City Commissioner MORTON, ex-
city-engineer of Melbourne.
£1,200,000 is to .be stowed away in trust to
accumulate for as long as the law allows,
which is one lifetime and 21 years more. The
life selected is that of baby Lascelles, the
late Victoria’s great-great-grandson, who
comes of a long-lived family. When the
trust falls in 90 per cent, is to be distributed
in various ways, a good deal going to the
firm’s employees if the firm is still alive,
and 10 per cent, to the Leverhulme of the
period if there is one. This gives the race
an interest in the early death of baby Las-
celles. It seems a rather crazy will, but no
worse than some of the advice which the old
soapist gave us about how to manage Aus-
tralia.
Among the fair batch of Diggers who
have vanished since the war without leaving
any tracks is W. J. (“Snowy”) Evans, one
of the two Australian machine-gunners who
brought down the Fritz ace Richthofen.
Belated claims for the distinction have
recently been lodged on behalf of a Canadian
airman and others, but Australian medico
Barber, the only doctor who examined the
dead flier, was positive at the time that his
issue had been sent up from the ground,
Evans, who disappeared four years ago, had
a weakness for ’plane-shooting. He was at
it behind the line one day when a boiling
Scotch major broke through the near-by
hedge. “Desist, desist,” he bellowed. “Mon,
can’t y’ see you’re shootin’ at one o’ oor own
’planes?” “Sorright, Major,” drawled a
voice from the small bunch of spectators, “he
can’t hit it.”
In these days of wholesale criticism of
the flapper, Edna Redward, aged 19 years,
ought to be remembered. Three years ago
she acquired infantile paralysis of a parti-
cularly virulent brand and recovered. For
five years after recovery from this terrible
complaint the sufferer’s blood is of inestim-
able value as an anti-toxin for injection
into others. The fluid is usually extracted
under an anesthetic, and on three past
occasions Miss Redward has volunteered for
the unpleasant but charitable service. When
her father learnt the other day that the
Melbourne Hospital doctors feared the
disease was once more developing the
dimensions of an epidemic he wired to Edna
in Adelaide, and she promptly responded.
A queer-looking character who has lately
been having a turn round Australia is R.
Ponsonby Fane, an Englishman whose years
of residence in Japan have made him discard
tweeds and don the Nikko national apparel.
Fane has been secretary to various British
governors in different parts of the world,
including Natal and Hong Kong with Sir
Matthew Nathan. He believes it will be an
age or two before the Jap accepts stiff col-
lars and boiled shirts; those who do wear
Western raiment, he says, do so strictly for
business reasons.
Dr. F. C. Shaw, Government medical
officer at Wyalong (N.S.W.), has been
elected Mayor of that town for the twenty-
first consecutive term. A record for the
State is claimed.
Bored stiff after 27 years of it, T. H.
Payne intends to get out of the Vic. Upper
Chamber in June, when his term ends. Had
he taken a keener interest in politics he
might have had any job but the Premiership,
or had he asserted himself in 1923, when he
was acting-President, he would have got the
chair instead of Frank Clarke, and, of
course, bagged the knighthood.
Bananaland lost one of its “gun” shearers
when George Daniels accidentally collected
a charge of shot on a duck-sliooting venture
at Quilpie recently. He had been ringer in
most sheds in the West, wdiere for years he
did a solid business as a shearing and
general contractor.
A good many of the few hundred Diggers
who are making various-sized crusts out of
chicken-runs in N.S.W. have a “hear-hear”
for E. Hadlington’s appointment as State
poultry expert. As inspector with the
Returned Soldiers’ Settlement Dept., Had-
lington fixed up most of the poultry-farms
in the State, and did the job well. He has
been judging birds at the Sydney show for
10 years, and succeeds his dad in the present
job.
Instead of there being three governors for
the Pentridge, Metropolitan and Women's
prisons at Coburg (Vic.), the jobs have been
combined, and Michael Stapleton has been
made first boss, with J. B. Bowen as offsider.
Stapleton draws the poor screw of £516 a
year and quarters for running the triple
show.
The State made a neat profit out of Rich-
mond Carter’s bid for the Gippsland South
seat in the Vic. Assembly. Carter, who was
an inspector under the Rabbit Destruction
Act, forwarded his resignation before he
nominated, but the department considerately
held it from the Executive Council. He is
now back at his old job, but will not be
paid for the time he was off campaigning,
and, in addition, the State has the £5O
deposit he lost.
Deane P. Mitchell, who has come to Aus-
tralia with L. Urquhart and W. H. Corbould,
directors of Mount Isa mine, to examine that
Bananaland property for the Russo-Asiatic
Consolidated Co., of London, has many
friends in the Commonwealth. He was Her-
bert Hoover’s right-hand man when they were
both engineers connected with Bewick, More-
ing and Co. in Westralia.
About the time this appears, T. J. Henry,
doctor and dad of swimmers Ernest and
Goya, will roll his swag in New Orleans,
Tokio, Port Said, or some other part of the
globe, and take the sea tracks for some other
port. Since he pulled down his plate in
Grafton (N.S.W.) six years ago, he has
visited almost every country on earth that
can be got at in a ship. The doc. has an
extraordinary memory ; without notes he can
lecture for hours on Shakspeare and other
scribes. Once he wound up a lecture he’d
been commissioned to deliver on Egypt by
reciting “Ginger Mick” —the book—without
reference to it.
ALEX. ALAM, M.L.C., Sydney, talking—
probably about Alex. Alam.
The baronet Daniel Cooper, who must be
Australia’s costliest absentee, is giving the
place from which he draws his wealth a look-
over, along with another grandson of the
original Daniel. The present baronet was a
captain in the A.S.C. during the war; he
came to the title, etc., through his father, a
younger son of the original Daniel, the elder
one having died without heir. The Cooper
estate at one time rivalled W. C. Went-
worth’s ; between the two a large part of
the southern shores of Sydney harbor from
Darlinghurst outward was cut up. Daniel,
besides, bought city blocks very extensively.
The Ragless family, better known as the
South Australian 11, tally up to a total age
of 813. They descend from John Ragless,
who married at Adelaide in 1844. Of the
eight sons and three daughters the eldest
lad, William, is 83, and the youngest, Henry,
62. The family average is about 74.
Parsons aren’t usually supposed to be
experts in such unspiritual matters as motor
headlights, but the Rev. A. P. J. Atkinson,
of Ascot Yale (Vic.), has fathered a new
device which looks so promising that a co.
is being formed to exploit it. The scheme is
to attach the lamps by means of joints to
the track rod, so that when the car turns
a corner the beam from one lamp is swivelled
with it, while the other continues to light
the road ahead. And everybody wonders why
he didn’t think of such a simple thing him-
self.
For weeks Joe Sternberg, “father” of the
Vie. Leg. Council, had been clinging to life
by a thread, and there was no surprise when
the thread frayed and snapped the other day.
During his 37 years’ membership of the
Chamber his most meritorious work was done
on the board which exposed sweating in
industry 35 years ago. Cohen, K.C., the un-
official leader of the Leg. Council, is now
the sole representative of the Chosen in
either House.
The passing out of William O’Brien, one-
time deputy chief officer of Melbourne’s Fire
Brigade, recalls a rescue that thrilled the
city in 1895. The ship Hilaria caught fire
alongside the wharf at Port Melbourne, and
in leading his men Superintendent Gee fell
down a hold on to the burning cargo.
O’Brien was lowered, and, although his air-
pipe fouled, succeeded in getting a rope round
his chief. Both were hauled to the surface,
Gee to die and O’Brien to see a row of
Humane Society medals on his chest.
Died in London recently, A. M. (Alec)
Stewart, one of the drygoods firm of Alex-
ander Stewart and Sons, which was bound
up with the beginnings of Queensland com-
mercial life and has now wound up its affairs.
An old Brisbane Grammar boy, he joined the
big firm when he left school, and after a few
years in Brisbane went to the London office,
then in charge of his brother .C.T. Later
he took over the command there, and held it
till ill-health retired him in 1926. Though
never a prominent athlete himself, he took
the keenest interest in his earlier days in the
Past Grammars, the famous Queensland
Rugby Union Club which was an offshoot of
the big school. Incidentally, the clnb’s first
secretary was also an Alec Stewart, member
of another of the Scottish families that have
bulked big in Queensland’s story.
Bertram Mackennal is doing two busts of
the George Turner who was twice Premier of
Vic. and twice Commonwealth Treasurer.
One is to be presented to the State for the
Parliamentary library, Melb., and the other
is to go to Parliament House, Canberra.
Turner’s two daughters, who gave the sculp-
tor the order, have gone to the Cold Country
to have a look before the finishing touches
are put on.
A solid trier among the New Guinea gold
seekers is N. P. H. Neale, who has emptied
enough enthusiasm into various ventures to
have made him a Henry Ford if they’d
panned out all right. A telegraph key-tapper
when war broke out, he lent a hand at cen-
soring till the First Div. sailed. He saw
the war through, collected a commission and
a chestful of medals, and returned to try to
assure an unresponsive public that flying
was safe, enjoyable and worth a pound or so
per trip. When that scheme crashed he
tried to bore oil out of the Sepik River
jungle, but gave this up to pitch a tent at
Edie Creek. He was one of the million and
a quarter editors of Digger magazines.
John Blair Mason, who died at Auckland
the other day aged 69, was commissioned by
the Vic. Government in the late ’eighties to
make marine surveys and supervise defence
and public works. He reported on all the
Victorian harbors in 1887 and directed their
resurvey, and in 1890 was appointed marine
engineer and surveyor in the Ports and
Harbor Department. Returned to M.L. in
1901 lie joined the Otago Harbor Board as
engineer, secretary and treasurer. In 1919
he moved to Auckland, where .he practised
his profession privately till the end.
Alf Billson,- who cantered past his 70th
milestone at Toorak the other day, was in
the ATc. Assembly for 25 years. His con-
stituency was wiped out by the seats redis-
tribution scheme, which he helped carry
through by pairing with McLachlan, one of
its opponents. He might have got in again,
but he thought a quarter of a century a fair
score.
A. J. Derrick, great friend of Melbourne’s
down-and-outs, is giving up his official
association with the Methodist City Mission.
Thirty-five years ago he turned in architec-
ture to take on the Mission secretaryship,
and ever since has been helping up the city’s
waifs and strays and collecting confidences
and stamps. He has written scores of papers
about the stamps of the Oceanic Islands, on
which he is the recognised expert. _ For many
years he has been unofficial adviser to the
Commonwealth postal and stamp-printing
authorities.
Beckett, the Minister who unsuccessfully
tried to get the Tote Bill through ATc.’s
Legislative Council, admitted to fellow-
members that gambling for gain was a mug’s
game. Having tried all or most forms of it
from two-up to draw poker, and having
risked pounds when it would have been
more prudent to have chanced pence, he had
given it best. For eight years he had not had
a ha’penny on a horse although he had gone
to many race-meetings. It was cynical and
breezy, but not at all the speech to win
over doubtful members.
GEORGE LAM BERT, winner of this year’s
Archibald Prize.

Townsville. William Brown (83), W. A.
Ackers (80), Henry Abbott (82), John
Hearne (84), McQueen (86), Tom Ganett

son (83) have all been living there for 50
years or more.

lie pulls out a fancy kind of case and hands
me a fat cigar,
And he seemed to be saying, “Look, here I
am —and there’s where you darned well
are.”
"An old acquaintance of mine,” he says, and
his wife through her glasses glared.
“An old acquaintance !” Well, spare me days !
—still, it isn’t as if I cared.
Him and me we were cobbers once, till one
got ahead of the game,
And I happened to sight him in town to-day
—an’ that was the thud I came.
I’ve known things happen like that before, so
I ought to have been prepared.
But him and me we were cobbers once —still,
it isn’t as if I cared.
It wasn’t long till I toddles off; I might
have found lots to say
To the cobber I used to know, but not to the
bloke that I met to-day.
I couldn’t talk of the times we’d had, or the
crook spins that we’d shared,
With me “old acquaintance.” Well, strike a
light!—still, it isn’t as if I cared.
I could have brought things to his memory,
but I didn’t, I just sat pat;
I could have said “Do you mind the time—?
but what was the use of that?
I could have opened the old girl’s eyes, and
I’ll bet that she would have stared.
Oh ! I could have told him a thing or two —
still, it isn’t as if I cared.
Well, well, it’s over an’ done with now, and
I’m feeling no bitterness.
What does it matter? And anyway what’s
an old mate more or less?
There’s neither, maybe, will have too much
left when the last accounts are squared.
But it’s hard to think we were cobbers once

“AdeL.” : Dying out with the older natives
of the Gulf of Carpentaria is the art of
making dilly-bags such as have been used
by many generations of abos. To-day but
few old gins can fashion these artistic gems
of knitting, the materials for which arc
obtained from the inner bark of kurrajong
and from the fibres of various palms, and the
dyes are extracted from certain vegetables
and minerals. The secret of these dyes will
go with the old girls to their graves. Another
art which will pass with these old ladies is
the weaving of fishing-nets, in which they use

materials similar to those in the dillies.
The younger gins about the stations now
make dillies that are poor imitations of
their white sisters’ handbags, knitting them
with brightly-colored sports wool.
* * * *
“Sea Nomad” : Wackett’s ’planes have been
responsible for some severe frights. Flying
low over the Home island group, one swooped
just above a trochus-shelling cutter. The
whole crew dived overboard, one lad hopping
off from the masthead. Another ’plane
caused consternation when cruising above the
waterway separating Moa and Badu islands.
The approaching noise puzzled the villagers,
as “thunder longa Nor’-West season never
come up that fella way before.” A boatman
fishing off shore was the first to spot the
“great pelican” and shout the tidings. As the
“pelican” roared nearer he made a beeline
for the shore and ended by sweeping his boat
up on the sands. The women of Poid
village took to the bush, leaving their squal-
ling piccaninnies kicking beneath the coco-
palms. The men ran, too, and even the fowls
raced for the shelter of the houses. One girl
alone stood her ground and jeered at the
flying villagers. She was the school-teacher's
assistant and had seen the picture of a
’plane in the teacher’s mail. A woman wash-
ing among the rocks hid her baby under her
clothes, then knelt down and prayed. These
Torres Strait natives are civilised, but if
Wackett flew over the Tugeri country in
New Guinea he’d be responsible for many
heart failures amongst those unsophisticated
head-hunters.
H*
“Scribo”: Apropos of “Tesp’s” inquiry
(B. 22/12/’27) about the crystal-like sub-
stances found in the heads of whiting, two
apparently similar substances are found
behind the eyes of all catfish caught in the
Burnett River (Q.). Before the war Ger-
man buyers used to pay as much as 7s. 6d.
per pair for them, to be used in jewellery.
“Aalia”: The crystalline substances re-
ferred to by “Tesp” are also found in jewfish.
They are unattached and vary in size propor-
tionately to the size of-the fish. Some I have
taken from jewfish caught in the Ilawkes-
bury River were about half the size of a man’s
thumb-nail.
* * * *
“Max” : It is not the usurping sparrow of
“Carty Mac” (B. 15/12/’27) but the de-
struction of native trees that is driving away
bur indigenous birds. They cannot live with-
out the bush, though a few varieties of the
smaller kinds earn a living in orchards and
gardens. If “Carty Mac” desires to keep
native birds within sight and sound let him
plant gum-trees, turpentines and the like.
Besides the attraction of the honey-laden
flowers, the bush birds will find sustenance
in the insect- and scale-pests which attack
the trees. A turpentine in full flower in
November, alive with scarlet honey-eaters, is
a sight worth seeing. It is wonderful how
lhe birds arrive from apparently nowhere if
there is a flowering eucalypt about.

“Pick” : Recent repairs to a culvert on the
road from Cooma to Bombala (N.S.W.)
cleared up an old-time mystery. Many moons
ago Bob and Scotchy, two dogs of Kimo farm,
on the Bibbenluke closer-settlement area, dis-
appeared. They had been seen enjoying a
rabbit-chivvy on the road; then they had
vanished, and all efforts to trace them had
failed. Removal of the culvert decking
brought to view their two skeletons.
Scotchy had wormed his way into a rabbit-
burrow under the lowrnr side log of the
bridge head. Bob, in attempting to follow,
had blocked the entrance; a downward spike
in the log had hooked his collar. Thus
imprisoned the poor devils had starved to
death within half a mile of their home.

“A.W.L.” : Tell “Toonooba” (B. 22/12/’27)
I have seen several specimens of the giant
clam that exceeded 2ft. 6in. in length. I
have a photograph of one 4ft. long with a
pearl-sheller’s two little girls sitting in it.
The shell closes slowly, not with a snap.
When the clam is disturbed the fringe, which
waves about in the water like a great sea-
anemone, is suddenly withdrawn, thus dis-
closing the ugly three-toothed white edges.
Then the shell starts to close gradually. I
inserted a piece of coral in one on Chap-
man Reef, Torres Strait, but the clam imme-
diately ejected it, throwing up a tiny column
of water to a height of 10 feet. There is
a story of a native who took his unfaithful
wife out on the reef at low water and thrust
her arms between the lips of a gigantic clam,
leaving her there to undergo the slow torture
of death by the rising tide.
* * * *
“Pfella” : There’s a vast difference in the
feet of an abo. and
a Malay, although
both possess a simi-
lar flatness. Black
brother places as
much value on his
toes as on his fin-
gers, having special
regard for the big-
one ; he can have a
sore on any other
part of his body
without caring, but
the moment his big-
toe is in trouble lie
is down on his
hams nursing it.
When he climbs the
limbless portions of
tree-boles this toe
sustains his whole
weight while fresh
niches are hacked
out above. A Malay
couldn’t do that;
indeed, nine out of
10 Malays couldn’t
shin up a tree at
all. But put them
a hundred feet up
and they can walk
along limbs slant-
ing either up or
down, a trick few
abos. can perform.
On a pearling
schooner we had
two abos. among a
crew of Straits
islanders. Eve r y
time, they attempted
to walk the ship-
rail they fell over-
board if no rigging
was near enough to grab. But the Malays
couldn’t be prized off with a crowbar.
* * * *!■
“Lagani-Namo”: I nominate the bronze-
skinned Gaili (Papuan) girls as the neatest
and most symmetrically tattooed natives in
any part of the Pacific. The ink used is
made of the soot collected on their earthen
cooking-pots or from indigenous guhis. The
designs are first printed on the skin_ then
tapped in by a thorn attached about half an
inch from the end of a light six-inch stick.
Another light wand is used as a tapper by
the woman officiating. Formerly a special
significance pertained to each design, but
nowadays the artists work on whichever is
desired. Ordinarily the tattooing is begun
in early childhood on the fingers and fore-
arms, and it is proceeded with from time to
time until the marriageable “kikeni” assumes
full responsibility for the guardianship of
her decorated body. Though other native
damsels are all tattooed from forehead to
foot without a blank square inch, none show
such artistry as the shapely, Grecian-fea-
tured girleens of Gaili.
* * * *
“Gouger” : Nashu, of Darnley Island, was
fishing. So was Nokoli the eagle. Nokoli, his
eyes like diamond beads, saw the fish first and
flashed down, the whirr of the feathered meteor
startling Nashu a second before the spray
whipped his eyes. Then the sea
boiled from thrashing wings and
the whirlpool churned by a mad-
dened fish. For Nokoli had bit-
ten off more than he could chew.
The talons of the white-necked
sea-eagle strike deep. And the
struggles of the powerful blue
fish, clenching its flesh around
the piercing talons, dragged
Nokoli down, down, until the
water billowed above his thrash-
ing -wings.
“Sadwun” : I once met a swaggie with a
strange hobby (B. lb/12/'27). The old
fellow carried a fair-sized tin, in which he
had a collection of bits of stick culled from
almost every species of shrub in Australia,
together with pebbles and scraps of stone.
They were mementoes of the many places
he had visited; he could tell you his life’s
journeys by referring to them. One stick
was from Bourke, another from Nevertire,
and so on while the tobacco lasted.
:Jc He *
“Up North” : Crayfish the size of lobsters,
their shells studded with spikes, play hide-
and-seek among the crannies of the coral
reefs. When one is killed, sharks scent the
news from a great distance; for this reason
native divers never kill “crays” close to
grounds over which they are working for
shell or beelie-de-mer. Torres islanders,
when crayfishing always keep a specially
alert lookout for sharks. At low water over
the coral-grown reefs the men dive and peer for
the long feelers. The crayfish backs into the
corals as the native jabs at it. There is a
knack in catching a wounded crayfish. If
the uninitiated grabs one the “cray” back-
pedals and its spikes tear skin from the
ravaging hand. The “boys” prefer a long
splinter of iron with wdiich to spear the
HIS HANDICAP.
“Why are you so untidy? I suppose you've got a wife?”
“No, lady. I ’as ter earn me own livin’.”
thing; the iron sinks and is easy to handle,
whereas a bamboo-hafted spear requires sus-
tained effort to keep it under water. The
tips of the “cray’s” antennai are more sensi-
tive than wireless instruments. From a
study of these interesting Crustacea I am
cohvinced that they communicate intelli-
gently by means of these feelers and 1 by
vibrations sent out by the tail.
* * * *
“J.H.S.” : There is no need to visit Siam
to see communal ants’ dwellings built by
folding leaves into a large oval or circular
chamber (B. l/12/’27). On the Banana-
land coast there is a species of the pismire
family that constructs just such a domicile,
the overlapping leaves of which appear to
be webbed together. Nothing could be
drier and more cosy than these arboreal
dwellings, the doorway to which is under-
neath. The builder is a glossy-black,
rather robust pineher of moderate length,
and a favorite building site is the dense
foliage of an orange tre,e. At harvesting
time the glossy-black chaps waltz out in
dozens when their homes are roughly
handled, and swarm up the orange-gatherers’
hands and arms. Polyrachis rastellata has
no sting, but can give an irritating little
pinch.
* * * *
“H.V.E.”: I recently experienced the
effects of the bite of a yellow-and-brown-
striped spider common under pieces of bark
and other debris, especially in damp places.
The part bitten swelled greatly, but was
quickly relieved bv the application of strong
carbolic ointment. Next day a fresh lump
rose, but similar treatment finally scotched
it. The yellow stripe is undoubtedly toxic,
for on one occasion I collected a small army
of heterogeneous spiders in a pickle bottle,
including a sample of this particular
crawler, and h e strolled around biting the
others. Each spider, as soon as bitten,
curled up and died.
* * * *
“ Sniper” : The spider’s web which pulled
“Sucre’s”, hat off (B. 15/12/’27) could have
been spun by at least two of the species
known to me. A rather plump joker I’ve
met in South-east Queensland has the knack
of twisting threads together till they form a
cable strong enough to carry the heaviest
hat. He is grey in color, with a body about
IJin. long by ifm. wide.

He was sitting ’neatli a blackwood, and his
face was burned and red,
And a stream of perspiration was trickling
from his head.
“It’s ’ot enough fer anyone, but I’ve known
worse,” he said.
“Now, this ’ere is the kind o’ ’eat that

An’ yer can breathe jest natcheral; yer

In pools o’ sweat that choke a cove, an’

There ain’t no shade but stunted scrub —

“Yer raise a thirst that’s worth a mine,
an’ all that yer can get
Is a glimpse o’ empty bottles an’ mud that’s
’nrdly wet;
An’ the skeeters sing o’ whisky when the

“But ’ere,” he said, “it’s different.” He
pulled a bottle out.
“It’s ’eat that any cove can bear—what kills

It ain’t too far between the pubs that's open

Is the First Cost the Last Cost?
Just for the saving of perhaps a few shillings men are idle, service is disrupted,
inconvenience, loss of profit—all topped off with the outlook of a heavy repair bill.
It is not so much the first cost that should interest the purchaser, when long life
and freedom from annoying and costly trouble is taken into consideration.
His decision invariably favors the product with a world-wide record of depend-
able performance.

WHAT, AGAIN?
Armed Constable (for the third time): “Aw, Taubada, more
better you putim boot on.”
BON VIVEUR: “Hey? What —another boot! D’ya take me for
a blanky centipede?”
“Cactus”: When we heard that carpet-
snake skins were of commei’cial value a mate
and I decided that we would give the game a
trial. Within a few miles of us were several
old battlers earning a crust by chasing
the reptiles. I met one who cut a ring
around the snake’s neck and pulled the skin
off as if it were a sock. The skin, thus
turned inside out, was filled with fine sand
without moisture and hung up to dry. This
took about two days. The expert then made
a cut down the centre of the belly with
scissors. The skin treated in this fashion
was of a nice even shape and color. But the
experience was wasted on us, as my mare
soon tired of the business.
* * * *
“Toonooba”: Shoals of the many-hued
parrot fish make a picturesque sight when
feeding along the reefed surf lines of the
Great Barrier. A ruffling of the marginal
waters on a calm day marks the
approach of a school. Suddenly,
as if at word of command, heads
go down to the coral bottom
and the brightly colored caudal
tins, as the fish manoeuvre about,
are waved aloft like countless
miniature flags breaking the sur-
face of the sea. if the school is
disturbed, down go the tails and
away flash the fish. Though
armed with tough beaks adapted
to score coral, whether these
fish feed upon the living tissues
of the coral colonies is question-
able. Blocks of coral evidencing
attack by marine life are com-
paratively rare on reefs. Cer-
tain varieties, such as the mas-
sive Milleporae, ai’e capable of
inflicting severe stings. Since
a considerable quantity of coral-
sand is found in the fish's
stomach, the dead coral, with
its sheath of algae, etc., is pro-
bably the attraction.
* * *
“T.P.11.”: On December 30
a cow strange to the district
dropped her thix’d calf in Swan
Hill (Vic.). The owner sent
her 22 miles into N.S.W. to a
secure paddock, intending to
take the calf out next day. The
following morning the cow was
back in Swan Hill. To do the
return trip she had to swim
the Murray and get through
numerous fences. And the calf
had been shifted a mile during
her absence. Notwithstanding this, Straw-
berry was found with her infant next
morning.
>IC * * *
“Kooragai”: The wedgetailed eagle, over
which there has been so much argument, is
an interesting fowl when collecting material
for its big stick
nest. On account of
its short legs (only
Sin.) and its great
spread of wings
(over 7ft.), it rises
slowly and with
difficulty from level
ground. The heavier
timber on which
the bottom of the
nest is composed is
raised from a flat
surface by the bird
swooping across it
and clutching it
smartly in its
talons. Some pieces
ai’e obtained from
standing trees, and
there the birds
show both skill and
sagacity. The male
and female often
act in concert, the
former breaking off
a dead limb by
striking it force-
fully with its feet,
and the other dart-
ing down and catch-
ing it as it falls.
Many of the sticks
are awkward to
place in position in
the nesting tree,
and consequently
there is generally a
litter of dropped
pieces on the
ground beneath.
Only when the tree
stands in the open,
with clear level
ground around the
butt, can a dropped
stick be recovered.
Usually a lofty ele-
vation is chosen,
and the same nest
may be used for
several years, the huge platform being re-
topped each breeding season, and employed
between times as a dining table.
* * * *
“Up Top”: The Torres Islanders have
evolved a strict code of land laws, especially
on the fertile islands where cultivation means
such a lot. The land on Darnley, Murray
and other islands is marked out in plots
which are known even to the youngsters.
Trees, piles of stones and shells are the
recognised boundary-marks. The land is
handed down from father to son; should a
man die without sons, there is generally a
row when the relatives swoop down on the
cstat e. Almost as valuable as the land is
the great reef which surrounds so many of
tbe islmrds, for the islanders depend on
fishing when the seasons and gardens are
p oor- The foreshores are all owned in
u tt i e p i ots , and the rights in most cases
PX tend straight out over the water across
A GOOD YEAR’S WORK.
OFFICE, SICK VISITOR: “During the year I have paid one ’underd an’ fifty-nine sick
visits, an’ I’m pleased to repoort that none av ’em proved fatal.”
the reef. All fish, turtle and dugong within any
given man’s area belong to him exclusively.
Should a pirate encroach on the right he is
liable to be knocked on the head. Where
two islands lie almost together there is an
imaginary boundary-line drawn across the
water between them. To trespass on the
opposite island’s fishing rights means wax 1 .
On a like principle the various island groups
have distinctive fishing rights over lonely
sandspits and reefs miles out in the open
sea. Although the Islanders have no writ-
ten records, they know the rights, chiefly
hereditary, of every man, woman and child.

“Lucifer”: Goanna oil (B. 8/12/’27)
can't penetrate glass. I put some into a
glass-stoppered bottle which I sealed with
paraffin, marking the level of the oil with
a steel scriber. Lack of results became
monotonous, and at the end of a year I used
the oil as embi-ocation.
* * * *
“Veronal” : One device whereby the festive
Papuan head-hunter snared his victim took
the shape of a circlet of twisted cane, to
which a long light stick of tough wood was
attached. In the middle of the circlet oppo-
site the operator a cruel spike was fixed. The
hunter chased his quarry, and when near
enough slipped the circlet over his head,
then jerked the stick backwards, driving the
spike into the back of his victim's neck and
rendering the completion of the transaction
easy.
* * * *
“Sea Nomad”: It takes many thousand
beche-de-mer to make a ton. Some species,
though 3ft. long, boil and dry down to lOin.
To avoid the deadly slow and hard work of
swimming after the fish in deep water the
men straighten out large fishing-hooks and
plug a pound weight of lead at one end, to
which is attached a line. In clear water the
big slugs can often be seen on the sandy
bottom. As the dinghy di-ifts, the driver
lowers his plumb-bob, hovers it just above
the fish, then lets the weight drop and the
quarry is harpooned. It is hauled to the
surface very quickly, otherwise it bloats and
balloons and slips off the barb. Escaped and
on the bottom again, it blows itself into a
ball: no amount of jabbing will then
fix it, as the barb seems to slip through and
out of the fish' as though the skin were of
the finest silk. There is a knack in this
harpooning. The slugs may lie nine fathoms
deep and objects on the sea bottom are very
deceptive, especially through many feet of
water. Then the tide may be running; this
will carry the lead w'eiglit many feet beyond
: the marksman’s aim. which means that the
dinghy has to be pulled back to get another
shot. But the “boys become wonderfully
expert; they can allow for distance, decep-
tion and current with . uncanny precision.
The harpooning method in clear, deep water
saves a great amount of time and physical
exertion.
* *
“Silentio” : Can any others beat the grape-
vines planted over 100 years ago in Pen-
fold’s vineyard at Branxton (N.S.W.) ? They
are carrying crops big enough to satisfy any
vigneron, and look as if they will do duty
for a few years yet. Another grand old
specimen can be seen growing at a bank in
Parramatta. It has a butt big enough for
a tree and climbs right up to the balcony,
where it produces wonderful bunches well
out of harm’s way.
* * * *
“Wang” : Jobson, who runs a dairy farm
out Dandenong way, has had an experience
as disappointing as that of Dad Wilkins
(B. 22/12/’27). “I thought I’d struck a
reg’lar jewel of a bloke,” he confided to me.
“The first mornin’ I went t’ call him t’ get
up fer the milkin’ I finds him movin’ about,
lie tells me he’s been up since three o’clock
—it was four then. When I congratcherlate
him on bein’ an early riser lie gives me a
sour look an’ says it’s a case of have ter.
I didn’t say nothin’ more, thinkin’ he’d got
the toothache or somethin’, an’ goes an’
rounds up th’ cows, tellin’ him that’s t’ be
his job each mornin’. I noticed he didn’t
seem t’ be overpleased about it. Nex’ mornin’
I’m up at three meself, an’ there he is, standin’
at the door of his hut lookin’ down over the
hill t’ the south through a telescope. I goes
up an’ says there’s no need t’ look through
the telescope for the cows, as they always
camp at night on the side of the hill, an’ all lie’s
gotter do is ter send Rover t’ bring ’em in.
He gives me a hard look. ‘Damn the dog an’
the cows,’ he says, ‘l'm lookin’ fer the new
comet. They say it’s t’ be seen in the south
’bout three in the mornin’.’ Wot d’ yer think
o’ that? And since the comet’s gorn I carn’t
get the blighter out till five.”
* * * #
“Yero”: The wliite-striped lizard usually
homes under pieces of bark, logs and stones,
but I recently came across a large one which
had taken lodgings in a rabbit-burrow, as
that unpleasant boarder the black snake
occasionally does. The white-stripe has the
power of instantaneously changing his com-
plexion from light to dark and vice versa
according as he lies in bright sunlight or in
shadow. This gentle little saurian may be
picked up and handled; he rarely attempts
to bite.
* * * *
“Nikko” : Something unique in the way of
an eating-bowl has arrived at Auckland. It
is a wooden trough nin.3 feet long and over two
feet wide, along which on a banquet night
the warriors lined up to celebrate. Nobody
in the Solomons, where it was found by a
missionary, knew anything of the history of
the relic or when it was last used.
THE NAMOI!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I know a river in the hills,
My Namoi!
Where the ci’ystal mountain rills
Tumble o’er the pine-clad steep
And the flashing waters leap,
Out where play the sunlit fountains,
Deep set in the lonely mountains,
My Namoi!
Down the valley to the plain
Glides Namoi!
Swirling in and out again ;
Over many a rocky bar,
Where the foaming shallows are,
There the storm-fed torrent gushes
Past the sedge and waving rushes,
My Namoi!
In the sunshine and the rain
Flows Namoi!
Through the valley to the plain ;
Where the black swan, flighting low,
And the ibis westward go,
Swollen by New England snows
Broad and deep the river flows,
My Namoi!
On and on the river goes,
My Namoi!
Past Manilla Town it flows
To the Barwon, to the sea,
Through far realms of mystery,
Where the curlew’s mournful wail
Echoes down the Sunset Trail
By Namoi!
River, running strong and free,
O Namoi!
Laughing, leaping, full of glee,
Where the purple ranges rise
Tier on tier xxnto the skies,
My Namoi!
When I hear the north wind sighing,
Then my soul for thee is crying,
Calling for the reeds that quiver,
Longing for the Western river,
My N ainoi!
Foaming o’er thy granite bars,
’Neath the light of Western stars,
Oh, Namoi, my lover be,
On thy bosom, rolling free,
Bear me to the Tideless Sea!

SUPER. DOUBLES YIELDS.
“Azac”: The value of varying amounts
of superphosphate on the yield of wheat was
determined by experiment last season in the
Trangie (N.S.W.) district, and it was found
that 1091 b. of superphosphate per acre gave a
yield of 18$ bushels per acre as against 9$
bushels from an unmanured area, care being
taken to see that all varying factors were
eliminated, thus making it possible to claim
that the increased yield was entirely due to
the superphosphate. Where 30, 50 and 78 lb.
superphosphate were used on other plots the
yields were 13, 14 and 17i bushels respect-
ively. Taking the current price of wheat,
and reckoning the superphosphate as costing
6s. Id. per cwt., the increased profit due to
the fertiliser amounted to from about fl in
tha case of the smaller amounts of super, to
£2 4s. per acre where 1091 b. of the fertiliser
was used.
The increase in favor of the fertilised areas
would have been greater only for timely
rains in the, spring, which bucked up to a
remarkable degree unmanured areas that
prior to the rains were looking very down
and out. On the other hand, the plots on
which super, had been used, particularly the
heavily-fertilised sections, looked as if they
could have gone without rain—it had been
a very dry winter —until harvesting, which
took place only a few weeks back.
Incidentally the results of these experi-
ments knocked fiat the widely-held opinion
amongst Western N.S.W. wheat-growers that
superphosphate is certain to burn a crop in a
dry year. Last year was beyond doubt a dry
one, not only around Trangie but through-
out the whole State, and yet the above
results were obtained. In defence of super,
it is pointed out that it has the effect of
enlarging the root system of plants, which
enables them to forage over a greater area
of soil, thus making them the better able to
withstand droughty conditions. Of course
these experiments were carried out on ■ land
that had been fallowed the previous year, but
that should be the practice of every wheat-
farmer, particularly in dry districts like
Trangie.
PICKLING WHEAT.
“John Ploughman”: Dry pickling with
copper carbonate dust is superior to the wet
method, though many farmers pin their faith
to the latter. In an official experi-
ment dry-treated seed germinated at the rate
of 94 per cent., wdiile wet-treated seed gave
only 77 per cent. The dry seed also ger-
minated four days earlier than the wet seed.
Either formalin or bluestone is used to
make a wet pickle. Where smutty seed is
to be treated it is advisable to use blue-
stone. It is very important that the correct
standard of strength should be maintained.
With seed that is clean lslb. bluestone to
10 gal. water is the correct strength, but for
smutty seed another slb. bluestone should be
used. With formalin it is customary to
use lib. to 50 gal. water. This is very
convenient to use, but if the pickled seed
is not sown within a fortnight the skin
toughens and faulty germination results.
The seed should be immersed for four or five
minutes in the solution.
The objection raised to the dry-dusting
method by some farmers is that bunt balls
cannot be removed by skimming as in the
wet method. But provided the seed is
thoroughly dusted all bunt spores are killed
directly the sown seed comes in contact with
soil moisture. Experiments show that
copper carbonate dust stimulates germina-
tion and increases yields. Two oz. will
treat a bushel of seed, and machines for
dusting are sold at reasonable prices. The
carbonate can be applied by spreading the
seed on a clean floor, dusting the powder
over it and thoroughly mixing, so that every
grain is coated. Sometimes during harvest-
ing operations the coat of seed wheat is
slightly cracked, and though the cracks may
not be visible to the eye they permit the
entrance of a wet pickle, and germination
is affected. Copper carbonate dust is not
injurious to the grain at any time.
It is advisable when sowing dry-pickled
wheat to set the drill to sow 5 to 101 b.
more per acre than is required. The powder
tends to accumulate on the sowing cups and
the seed runs slower than is desired. Grease
the front of the revolving cups daily with
a mixture of kerosene and oil.
OAT VARIETIES IN VICTORIA.
“Digger” : Ninety per cent, of tlie oats
sown in Victoria for the present harvest
are Algerian. The next favored variety is
Mortgage lifter, to which 6 per cent, of
the area is sown. The balance is split up
among Lachlan, Burt’s Early, Sunrise, Cal-
cutta, Palestine, Mulga and Tartarian in
the order shown. Of the newer varieties
Palestine stands out prominently. This is
the earliest variety grown, ripening in some
districts fourteen days before Algerian. A
short-strawed variety, it carries an attractive
head of plump grain. It is an ideal variety
for the Mallee, where its earliness enables
the oat harvest to be completed before, the
early wheat is ready. For green feed it is
invaluable. On account of its early growth
green feed is available when it is most
needed. Tested throughout Victoria it has
everywhere given higher yields than any of
the other varieties.
BUILDING A HAYSTACK.
“Pick”: To build a haystack with binder-
cut: hay, estimate the amount to be stacked
by counting a ton of hay for every three
pounds of twine used in binding. Plot the
stack base by allowing two feet of diameter
for every ton. Mark the ground plan with
a circumference of pegs. Begin building in
the centre by laying a ring of sheaves closely
butt to butt and overlap them with a second
ring placed also with the heads outward.
Continue this process till the circumference
has been approached near enough to lay
the outer ring. Then reverse the sheaves so
that their butts will appear on the outside
of the stack. Each ring should have at least
a half lap over the ring preceding. Go
ahead, repeating the process tier by tier,
meanwhile kneeing each sheaf tightly into
place. There should be a constant gentle
downwards slope from the centre outwards,
but if at any stage this should disappear
heap up with loose hay or extra sheaves.
When the stack has grown to about 9 or
10 feet in height, there should still be three
waggon loads to be drawn from the paddock.
Then commence topping off by lessening
the circumference of the succeeding tiers.
Bring the top to a sharp peak, and surmount
with a hat-sheaf spread dish-wise at the butt
and twisted into a knot at the head. A
stack so built will turn off any rain and,
except perhaps a few sheaves at the summit,
will be good hay when required. And even
these few sheaves may be preserved by cover-
ing with a stack cloth or a rug of old corn
bags.
MORE ABOUT EASTERN DORRIGO.
“W.S.F.”: I can’t agree with “Yufu’s”
idea (P>. l/12/’27) of the suitability of the
Eastern Dorrigo for dairying. The soil
generally is clay, with small areas of red or
chocolate loam. The average rainfall is about
65 inches a year. The country generally
is hilly to steep with small pockets of undu-
lating country along the rivers. About 50 p.c.
of the cleared land carries paspalum, and the
remainder carries bracken and other rub-
bish. The climatic conditions do not favor
dairying—five solid months of winter, with
numerous frosts and westerly winds. The
average dairyman’s cheque per month aver-
ages about 30s. per cow for four months
of the year, and for the remaining months
very much less.
The general opinion of the local folk is
that the Government made a big mistake
when it threw open the district for settle-
ment purposes, as th.e timber growing
thereon would have been of much more value
than the present alienated land. There are
more abandoned farms on the Eastern Dor-
rigo than any other part of the North
Coast.
In conclusion, I would like to say that
Top Dorrigo is far superior to Eastern Dor-
rigo in many ways, and I would recommend
it to any intending selector; but all the
good land has been taken up.
THE PREDATORY GOAT.
“S. Aus.”: “Azae” (B. 22/12/’27) is far
too kind to the goat, even regarded as a
weed-killer. My experience is that, with the
exception of prickly-pear, lantana and a few 7
other pests, he kills everything he touches,
and spreads pests rather than eradicates
them. I would be keenly interested to know
what brand of “temporary” fence w r as used
to prevent the goats getting out of the pad-
dock in the experiment “Azac” describes.
Bitter experience in my youth taught me
that no kind of temporary fence was of the
slightest use, and convinced me that if
ever I had to keep goats again I’d select
two islands somewhere in the Pacific —one
for myself, horses, cows and other useful
animals and cultivation paddocks, and the
other for the goats, with a good stretch of
sea between us.
TEN COWS AN HOUR.
“Eureka” : “Wob” (B. 22/12/’27) says that
six cows milked in an hour is good going. On
the South Coast of N.S.W. even the new
Pommy would be expected to milk more than
that. In dairies of 100 to 120 cows in the Bega
district there are usually four or five milkers.
The cows are yarded at 4 p.m., milked, the
milk separated, washing-up done, pigs and
poddies fed, and everyone is ready for tea
a few minutes after six. A man who cannot
milk at least 10 cows per hour need not look
for a job on the South Coast.
BUYING DAIRY STOCK.
“St. Rawberry”: “Yufu’s" advice to the
new-chum dairyman (B. 22/12/’27) is all
right so far as the selection of cows is con-
cerned. But let me advise the newcomer to
avoid, if possible, the purchase of beasts on
any but their first calves —-heifers. No estab-
lished dairyman will sell his best cows, nor
yet his next best. If lie has too full a yard
he will sell the culls. Only by paying
high prices at a clearance sale can the new
man secure good cows at their top-production
period, generally taken to be from the third
to sixth calf inclusive.
“Yufu’s” points apply equally well to
heifers, but unless the budding cocky be ex-
ceptionally lucky he will not secure above
50 per cent, of his herd to show even ten of
“Yufu’s” l(i points.
Eschew the over-large framed cow, except
she have fine points: thin muzzle, small
horns according to breed, small feet, thin
whippy tail, tapering neck, and no loose fat.
Many shorthorns (Illawarras or dairy I dir-
hams 1 throw back to beefy types, and these
will be found good for the butcher only.
It is not easy to establish the Shorthorn-
Jersey cross. Given three to four years and
some few spare acres of grass, the dairyman
may have his own-bred heifers of this most
desirable cross. Use a good Jersey bull on
Shorthorn or Ayrshire heifers, and breed
these back to another Jersey bull.
Be careful of introducing disease. There
is a preventive for mammitis; have your herd
inoculated. There is no known cure for con-
tagious abortion. Other diseases, including
tuberculosis, are more or less confined to
localities.
Never forget that even with “Yufu’s” par.
in your hand, and several text-books to back
it, you cannot be sure of buying sound cows
unless you pay full value —in these times
from £l6 to £2O per head. Heifers are diffi-
cult of selection, but you will get your pick
till, say, May next for £8 to £l2, and the
latter will produce within £5 per annum of
the matured cow’s earnings.
BETTER CHEESE WANTED.
“Eureka”: While every precaution is
taken to see that the dairy-farmer supplies
his cream to the butter factory in first-class
condition the same cannot be said of the
cheese factories. . Butter factories grade
their cream, and the clean, careful supplier
gets a higher price as his reward.
The cheese factory pays a set price
for milk regardless of quality or condition,
with the result that the suppliers get care-
less and a poorer class of milk is supplied
all round. This affects the quality of the
cheese, and whereas N.S.W. butter compares
favorably with the world’s best, only in rare
instances can this be said of the cheese.
An exception must be made in favor of
Ivameruka. In that case the cleanliness of
the factories and up-to-date methods are
reflected in cheese of uniformly good quality.
PIG FEEDING.
“Porky”: Pigs fed on maize or millet
alone produce a soft, oily bacon. Peas alone
give a poor-quality bacon. Barley, wheat,
oats and pollard, combined with milk, give
a first-quality bacon. A soapy bacon is
produced by feeding mainly on green lucerne
up to time of killing. This can be remedied
by feeding solely on grain for the last three
or four weeks. The grain should be gristed,
as pigs are liable to bolt the whole grain and
pass a percentage undigested. If potatoes
are fed they should be boiled and the water
thrown away. Good results will be obtained
by mixing potatoes, grain and skim milk in
the proportion of grain lib., milk 1 gal.,
potatoes 4lb.
The most economical method of feeding is
that in which the pigs have the run of good
pasture where self-feeders containing differ-
ent varieties of gristed grain are installed.
It is estimated that a pig on pasture will
consume lib. of grain daily for each month
of its age. If the pasture is of good quality
pigs fatten rapidly under this method. On
a good stand of rye grass, clover or lucerne
12 to 15 pigs will fatten on half an acre.
REARING A MOTHERLESS FOAL.
"Villers-Brett” : If the foal is an orphan
from birth the first feed should consist of
one pint new milk, into which is mixed a
heaped dessertspoonful of sugar dissolved in
water, and three tablespoonfuls of lime-water.
Bring the mixture to blood heat and let the
foal suck slowly from a bottle fitted with a
nipple. Rich milk should not be used —
about 3 p.c. butter-fat test is what is re-
quired, as a mare’s milk contains more sugar
and less .fat than a cow’s milk. Should
scouring, which is a sure sign of indigestion,
appear, give 2oz. castor oil, and give the
sugar and lime-water in plain water instead
of in milk while the condition persists. For
a few days give feeds hourly. The quantity
of milk may be increased and the number of
feeds decreased according to the progress
made. In about three weeks the foal should
be drinking out of the bucket. The sugar
can then be cut out, but the lime-water must
be continued. When a month old give the
foal a little oatmeal to nibble at, and allow
him to have the run of a small paddock with
a poddy calf for company. At two months
sweet skim milk can take the place of new
milk.
HANDLING LUCERNE-lIAY.
“Digger” : The feeding value of lucerne-liay
is determined by the care that is taken in
handling it in the field. From 40 p.c. to
00 p.c. of the crop consists of stems, while
the balance, consisting of leaves, is the most
nutritive part of the crop. As the leaves
contain the greater part of the flesh-formers
of the crop the importance of careful hand-
ling during haymaking will be realised. On
hot days the operations of mowing, raking
and cocking should follow one another.
Otherwise it is just as well to let it cure in
the windrows for three or four hours before
putting into cocks. As a rule the hay will be
ready for stacking in two or three days.
It is a good plan when cocking to make the
cocks of such a size as will enable them to
be loaded as one forkful. When unloading
do not tread on the load if it can be avoided.
When the hay feels crisp and yet pliable it
is in good condition for stacking.
A COTTON-GROWER’S EXPERIENCE.
“N.lv.”: In .1923 a new crusade was
preached throughout Queensland. The Gov-
ernment emissaries, also those employed by
the 8.A.C.A.L., toured the country and
urged farmers to grow cotton. We were
told that the land from Gladstone to Roma,
from Tweed Heads to York Peninsula, was
all eminently suitable for the production of
the vegetable. In common with many others
I determined to do my part in assisting to
clothe humanity.
By means of a tractor and the consump-
tion of large quantities of American kerosene
I ploughed and cultivated 50 acres of good
rich soil and planted cotton. It started
beautifully. Government experts, sometimes
three at once, would come and view the crop
and sit between the rows hnd marvel at
their straightness, the freedom from weeds
and the high standard of cultivation, and
speculate on the large profits I would make.
The cotton grew and grew and grew, four,
five and six feet high, and for six solid
months every night and morning the paddock
was a mass of flowers. But the bolls did not
form. It was not attacked by the boll-
weevil or even by the pink boll-worm, but
grubs and bugs of every sort, shape, size
and color made it their home. One bug
was especially prominent. He was large
and gaudy with the odor of a bed bug.
Experts called him the “stainer.” The gross
return from this crop was 50s. per acre,
and my ardor as a cotton-grower was
damped. Next year I grew a small area
with little better result, and the third year
an early frost put the finish on my crop and
I concluded that cotton-growing was not for
me. Cows and pigs now feed where once
the cotton bushes grew.
ELECTROCULTURE FOR TOMATOES.
“G.H.” : I have experimented with electro-
culture and can vouch for its value, especi-
ally with tomatoes. Last season I planted a
bed 18ft. x 30ft. and used a home-made
induction-coil, taking current from two dry
cells housed in a weather-proof box and
connected to two strips of hoop-iron buried
about sin. deep at each end of the bed. The
result was amazing. The plants bore an
enormous quantity of fruit much earlier
than usual, and were absolutely free from
wilt, although in previous seasons my toma-
toes were never free of this disease. I
found that switching on the current for an
hour each day was quite sufficient. This
was done just after watering, as dry earth
is not a good conductor of electricity.

DEVIL’S CLAW.
“Frederick” : Few station-owners have yet
realised the damage that can be caused by
the seedpods of the devil’s claw plant that
is spreading at an alarming rate over the
west and nor’-western portions of New South
Wales. The plant, which was introduced
to the State by flood-waters a couple of
years back, is somewhat similar to a vege-
table-marrow vine, and the pods when green
are like a small cucumber. As these pods
ripen they open up in the form of a huge
claw, which, when quite dry, is almost as
hard’ as steel. As the sheep are feeding
these claws close over the nose and mouth
of the animal, and if it doesn’t get human aid
the jumbuck must perish from suffocation or
starvation. I have seen seven fat ewes dead
in a corner of one paddock, with no other
sign but the death-grip of the claw. The
plant thrives in the poorest soil, but will
generally be found in creek-beds or on sandy
patches of ground. Although it has been
declared a noxious weed by most P. I*.
Boards, not nearly enough attention is given
the plant, which should be hoed and burned
before the pods have formed. Otherwise tlm
menace must spread, as every pod that dries
will either form a plant where it has dropped
or be carried by flood-waters, etc., on to —in
its case —virgin country.
LOGANBERRIES.
“M.C.” : To get the best value from this
vine it is necessary to prune very carefully.
Cut back the old canes after the fruiting
is over and then tie the new ones in posi-
tion for next year. As with grapes, the
loganberry takes up strength during the non-
fruiting period, and therefore the application
of rotted stable manure and decayed leaves
is decidedly helpful. While the vine will
grow in any position, tests have proved that
the easterly position always brings the
heaviest crop. Rich loamy soil suits logan-
berries, and before planting in sandy soil
a dressing of heavy clayey soil should be
dug in. Trellis-work is essential, and since
the loganberries are very thorny it is a wise
precaution to supply the trellis before setting
the vines.
AGAINST CARPET GRASS.
“W.H.H.”: I don’t agree with those who
recommend carpet grass as a pasture. If
it is a question of bracken or carpet grass,
by all means plant it; but in good country
no. It is a drought-resister all right—it
will resist anything—and it will grow on
the poorest of land where nothing else will,
but there are farmers who regard it as a pest.
WINTER EGG PRODUCTION.
“Jack Point”: “Max” (B. 22/12/’27)
accuses me of being off the target in attribut-
ing the falling-off in fowls’ laying in winter
largely to the shorter working day. “Max”
reckons it isn’t natural for hens to lay in
winter, but it isn’t natural for hens to lay
sequences of a hundred or so eggs without
going broody, nor for them to produce a
flock average of about 200 eggs per annum
whilst confined in an average floor space of
about five square feet, nor for them to com-
mence laying at five months old, nor for them
to lay a whole lifetime without male com-
pany, nor to do many other things which
are commonplaces of modern poultry-farming.
Practical poultry-farmers will bear me out
in my contention that the shorter working
day is a very large factor in reducing the
winter egg supply.
Certainly, as “Max” says, the moult has
to be fec'koned with, but it is not at all
uncommon for good hens to lay well into
their moult and to re-commence laying long
before the winter is over. Incidentally, the
use of lights to give a longer working day,
combined with judicious feeding, will help to
get the moult through quickly.
__ I have not overlooked the cost of current
to provide the light. A house to hold 500
layers would be lit by 12 40-watt lamps,
which would consume about threepenn’orth
of current per hour, calculating cost at 6d.
per unit. Suppose an average of 25 hours
of artificial light per week is supplied, that
means 12s. 6d. per week per 1000 birds. Five
per cent, increased yield would pay for that.
I don’t want to hold the Yankee poultry-
farmers up as models for us to follow slav-
ishly. But I’m sorry to infoi-m “Max” that
our utility Black Orps. are not held in rever-
ence by the Yanks. In fact, thousands of
Yankee poultry-farmers don’t know a thing
about them. Lights are used throughout the
U.S., and not only in those States where the
winter is more severe than ours. Let me
assure “Max” that the 400-egg-a-year hen
will come, but unless we go in for lighting
the Yanks are going to beat us to it. We
have got as far as 354 eggs, and the next
few years will probably see the 365 score
reached, but it’s going to be hard to get
beyond that without extending the working
day a bit.
DISHONEST WOOL-PACKING.
“Gamma”; Having bought and repacked
a quantity of wool at the preliminary Tas-
manian sales, I seriously question whether
honesty is the best policy for the small sheep-
farmer under the present seling- conditions,
or whether it pays him to skirt his fleeces.
The larger clips are, of course, well got up
and efficiently classed, but. the average
cocky’s clip is a marvel of cunningly-rolled
fleeces with the belly wool and stains con-
cealed, and black wool, rams’ wool and double
fleeces are worked in with an artistry worthy
of a better cause. Of course, the buyer is at
liberty to make a thorough examination, but
he could not possibly find time to value a
catalogue and exhaustively overhaul every
bag and bale of wool.
This is not a cry over spilt milk. One
knows what to expect in Tasmania, and
the result is that the honest fai-mer is penal-
ised to the profit of the dishonest, since one
simply lowers one’s buying limits a fraction
on the principle that losses on the swings
will balance profits on the roundabouts.
In the interests of commercial morality
brokers should be charged with the marking
of each brand on their catalogue as “skirted.”
“unskirted” or “bellies in.” For deliberate
and obvious false packing there already
exist ample remedies, but the inclusion of
black wool and overgrown fleeces, which by a
curious coincidence are always in the back
and near the bottom of the bale, is too small
a thing to take action upon. Yet in the
aggregate the practice seriously affects costs.
It is a difficult matter to handle, and prob-
ably will have to be tolerated until some
such reform as the bulk reclassing of all
star lots and bags is accomplished.
STUD SHEEP EXPORT.
“Tops”: One of the defenders of the popu-
lar Australian pastime of exporting prime
stud merinos to enable South Africans and
others to build up competition against us
has brought forward an ingenious defence.
He quotes the export from Britain, France
and Germany of machinery which is used
to manufacture articles that compete with
those turned out by the original machine-
makers, and argues that if the export of
machinery from these countries were pro-
hibited the trade in the raw materials which
the machines deal with would be curtailed.
The argument is unconvincing. Any nation
that wants to start manufacturing can in-
vent machines for itself or buy blue prints.

TIPS ON HANDLING WOOL.
“Mallee Stump”; “B-Gar” (B. 22/12/’27)
is quite wrong in liis directions for picking
up and throwing out a fleece of wool. This
is the proper way: Grasp the wool by the
hind legs and breech in each hand while
standing at the neck end. Then gather the
fleece from breech to neck, pinching to keep
it in a firm bundle. Throw from the pinch,
retaining hold of the hind legs till the fleece
falls on the table flesh side down.
Sweep all locks, pieces, etc., and any wet
dung from the floor so that the next fleece
shall not be stained or broken by sticking
to the floor. Skirt the fleece by removing
all stained or wet wool from the breech and
keep separate from clean wool. In small
lots, throw it under the table. Remove
kempy wool from the hind legs and proceed
round to the flank, taking off all sweaty
wool.
If the belly has been properly thrown out
by the shearer the sides will need no altera-
tion till the shoulder is reached. Remove
only what is strictly necessary here, as the
shoulder is the most valuable wool. Remove
the head piece and cheeks if adhering, as
this wool is usually kempy. Feel the neck
for sticks and thorns, and remove any that
are found.
If the wool is burry more skirting may be
necessary. To roll, fold both sides to the
centre, throw the neck back to form a
square; fold again side to side and roll
lightly from breech to neck. Do not tie the
fleece, as it has to be unrblled again on the
manufacturer’s sorting-table.
For flocks up to 250 sheep class in one
average lot and one “cast” lot. Throw all
heavy, yolky, discolored, sandy, burry, broken
or coarse fleeces to the cast lot and the
remainder will be a nice even average, suit-
ing some manufacturer’s requirements.
Baling and branding should receive care
and attention, as the packing is an index to
the contents. TJse stencil-plates and brand
with ink and brush. Brand the top and
front side of the bale with number, brand
and description. The result may be awaited
with every confidence.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“H.J.”: Waterglass or sodium silicate is
an excellent help at pruning-time. Mix it
in the proportion of three parts waterglass
to one of water and paint it on the tree
pruned. Waterglass is not injurious to
trees and excludes the air as soon as it is
applied. It also prevents sap exuding and
is a protection against fungus. A second
application is necessary in cases where the
sap flows freely.
“R. J.M.”: For worms in fowls give 4
drops of turpentine mixed with 8 drops of
sweet oil to each bird every three days. The
addition of loz. of Epsom salts to a gallon
of water in the drinking fountain will clean
the birds out after the treatment.
“Mayo”: For white scale on trees spray
with 1 gill of red oil to 6 quarts water, well
mixed. For bugs of various kinds use a
cup of kerosene to 10 quarts water. Badly-
affected leaves should be gathered, pests and
all, and burnt.
“Sylvester”: The haricot bean is a good
cropper and, like the lima bean mentioned
by “Silentio” (B. 22/12/’27), does well in
S.E. Queensland. An easy method of grow-
ing this bean is to sow thinly with maize,
say, one or two stalks to each hole. When
the maize is about a foot above ground sow
a bean close enough to each stool for it to
reach the plant. I have seen the dead stalks
loaded with beans after the maize was
pulled.
“Dingo”: A bran mash should be made
by putting 31b. bran and loz. salt into a
scalded bucket and pouring on 2| pints of
boiling water. Stir thoroughly and cover
with a bag for half an hour. If a bran and
linseed mash is wanted, boil lib. linseed with
sufficient water to leave two quarts of thick
gruel after three hours’ cooking. Immedi-
ately stir in 21b. bran and loz. salt, cover
and allow to cool. Strict cleanliness is
essential. Both varieties should be fed as
soon as prepared, for many serious gastric
and intestinal troubles can be traced to stale
or sour mashes.
“Nota Bene”; To make lime whitewash
take a clean watertight cask and put into
it half a kerosene-tinful of lime. Slake it
by pouring boiling water over it in sufficient
quantity to cover it five inches deep, stirring
it briskly until thoroughly slaked. When
slaked add 21b. sulphate of zinc and lib.
common salt, dissolved in water.
“M.W.H.”: A little-known fact about that
useful fodder tree, the myall, is that for the
first two or three years it doesn’t look a bit
like a myall. It’s a running vine with a
wattle-like leaf that curls up when you touch
it. When well-rooted it develops into the
well-known myall form.

A shy little girl was she.

She cuddled right up on his knee.

“Yes, you may, my daughter.

TROY.
THE TERRER OF THE SEAS.
A party of poor, down-cast school boys
marched despirittedly along the sea road
wile the crule school-master, Mr. Wackitt,
walked behind them, gloting at their Misery.
Well In- knew that they Deserved not this
AN EASY ONE.
VISITOR: “Can’t I do something for you, my poor
fellow?”
CONVICT: “Course you can, Lady. You can do my
twelve years.”
Tretment. For to-day was a Ilolladay, but
Walter Wackitt was by Nacher crule, and
he loved to keep Boys in for punishment,
and take them out on long walks for
Exercise. He kept a School, not because he
wanted to Teach, but on Purpose to Indulge
his Crule Despossition.
As the boys in their Innercent way
Cursed the master under their Breth, for
they knew they were in the holler of his
Hands, and that Resistance was Useless,
they little Knew that Delivverence was at
Hand. On, on they trudged, towards the
Frowning rocks at the Other End of the
Bay.
“Surrender, or you die!”
The boys Fell Back as a crowd of rugli-
looking Saillcrs, all with Skulls and Cross
Bones on their Caps and Jerseys, confronted
them. At their head was a Nobble-looking
man, little more than a Youth who had
given the Order. At sight of him Mi-.
Wackett turned Pail!
And well he might!
“Bernard Bravely!” he gasped.
“Yes, it is I,” said our Hero, with a
touch of Biterness in his voice. “Little did
you think ever to see me again, after that
night when your crule punishment Drove me
from School. Dettermind Never to be
Retaken, I took a boat and Cast Myself
adriffed in the Lonely Ocean. But the
kindly Hand of Fate decreed that I would
be picked up by Pierates, who I found to
be kinder than Schoolmasters, The Pierate
captain made me his Leftenant and Air, after
we had our fight with the Chinese Merchant-
man, in which I Signally Distinguished
myself. In the next fight he died, and I
became Captain.”
“The best Captain we ever had !” cried the
pierates.
Our Hero smiled at their Enthoosyasin.
“But—but” stammered the trembling.
Cravven Wackitt, “w-what are you doing
here?”
“I have made my fortune, and intend to
Retire from Business,” said our Hero, “but
first one Act of Justice has to be done —one
riscreant must be made to Suffer for his
Misdeed ! That Riscreant is You !”
It was in Vain for the unhappy Retch to
scream for pardon from the Youth who lie
had at one time Unmercerfully flogged. In
spite of his struggles he was carried to the
boat hidden in the Rocks, before the eyes of
the schoolboys, who Cheered wildly when they
realised what was Happening and knew they
were Free.
For over a week the miserable Wackitt
lay chained in his Cabin, deadly sea-sick,
but iller to think what the Pierates would
do to him. But at length he was Bought
op 1 )cck, to fall Griveliing at the feet of
On/ Hero.
"Mercy!” he cried.
“What mercy did you show to the Un-
fornitchit boys placed in your charge ? What
Mercy did you show to me?” demanded our
Hero.
“Let me off this once, and I promise never
to do it again. 1 will even give up being a
Schoolmaster!” implored the wretched
Craven.
“Death!” cried the pierates. “Let him walk
the plank!”
"Not so fast!” commanded our Hero,
giving a motion that waved them back as
they were about to seize their victim. “The
Terrer of the Seas has never yet had mur-
der on his hands in cold blood. No; we
will find another punishment.”
And at that moment something occurred
to distrack their attention. A man-of-war
came dashing over the Horison, and com-
menced to fire shots.
In an instant the guns were manned, and
flu: fire of the Enemy was returned. The
British man-of-war fought gallantly, but it
hadn’t the experiens of the Pierate, which
was always fighting; and, hit below the
water-line, it Struck its flag.
The warship was fast sinking, and Our
Hero humanly sent off his boats to bring
its crew to safety. The first to arrive was
the Captain with a man in Servilian clothes
with him.
“I am sorry,” said our Hero. Courteously,
“that I sank your boat. I do not like to
fight the English Flag, but 1 had to fight you
to save myself.”
“But we didn’t mean to sink you,” said
the captain. “This,” he said Indicating the
Servilian, “is the Judge—he will tell you
all."
“My noble boy,” said the Judge, “my son
was a pupil at Mr. Wackitt’s school, and
when he told me all about it and how you
had saved the boys from Unthinkable Tir-
rany, I moved the Admerality to send the
warship to you with a free pardon for you
and all your crew for being Pierates. That
is, of course, if you will give it up.”
“We were just about to retire from busi-
ness.” said Our Hero.
“That's splendid!” exclaimed the Judge.
“Everybody knows that you were good pier-
ate,s instead of being evil ones; so if you
hand over this ship, which was a sister ship
of the warship, to the navy, nobody need
know that you sank our vessel.”
Our Hero put the Propossition to the Crew
and their cheers showed their approval.
“They are all good fellows,” said our Hero,
addresing the Judge, “who deserve to be
pardoned. They were all foreetl to run
away from school as boys by crule School-
masters, and that is why they became
pierates; and we have only robbed Chinese
steamers and ships run by companies owned
by Wealthy Schoolmasters.”
The Judge shook his hand.
“I know all that, my boy,” he said,
heartily. “But. by the bye, where is
Wackitt? I will have him brought before
me for trial and give him the sentence he
deseryes.”
Our Hero’s arm pointed to the Coral Attoll
in the Offing.
“I would not have his Blood on my hands,”
he said, “so during the fight I had him put
ashore to Expirate his Sins in Solitude.”
PERFECTLY NOISELESS.
“Are you sure this room is quiet?”
“Quiet? Why, it never makes a sound.”
“It was a Noble Act to Spare him!”
exclaimed the Judge.
But Fate had designed that Justice would
not be cheated. That very night a great
storm arose, acompanied by a Submarine
Volcano; and the Coral Attoll disappeared
misteriously with its Lonely Occupant. Lost
in the Maw of the Deep.

ACCESSIBILITY~ANOTHER FEATURE OF THE IMPROVED FIVE-THREE
Accessibility is a vital point in Player-Piano construction. The Improved'Five-
Three ’ Beale has the simplest, most accessible action of any Player made.
NE of the most important feat-
w ures of the Improved 'Five-Three’
Beale Player-Piano, is that it has been
built upon the unit system. Each part
of the mechanism is a complete unit
in itself Each unit has one function to
perform—one only.
For instance, the whole
of the Beale player-ac-
tion itself mav be re-
J
moved entirely by
looseningiessthanhalf-
a dozen screws. The
valve units may be re-
moved two at a time
by unscrewing merely
one nut. Each valve
unit is complete in it-
self, and six extra valve
units are supplied with
each instrument in case a valve should
get damaged. If this does occur, it is
only necessary to take one of the spare
units and replace the damaged one.
The repair can be effected by anyone,
and in five minutes the instrument is
again ready for playing—such is Beale
accessibility. It is true that valves are
not likely to give trouble in an instru-
ment properly looked after. But even a
Rolls Royce carries a spare tyre —some-
times two! Other unique Beale features
are the new indestruct-
ible lacquer, not the
old-time French polish;
flush-type doors; in-
verted valves, giving
immediate power and
response; crash valve,
which means instant
pedal control; moth-
proof felt, including
hammers; and tonal
beauty surpassingly
rich and resonant.
A Beale instrument,
fully dismantled, is now on view at our
showrooms. Call and see it if you pos-
sibly can. Above all, ask to see the hot-
water test —no greater evidence of confi-
dence could be given. Full descriptive
matter post free. Terms, easiest possible.
In comparing other
instruments with
the Improved ‘Five-
Three 9 Beale, ONLY
COMPARE INSTRU-
MENTS IN THE HIGH>
EST-PRICEP CLASS.
The ‘Five-Three’ was
designed to compete
with this class, and
this only, notwith'
standing the low
price £or which it is
sold.
Th e Improved
‘Five-Three’ Beale
Player at the old price :
£ 205
shows a saving of any-
thing up to £7O.
The Beale is also available in
combination with the Ampico
—the world’s most wonderful
reproducing medium. Ask to
hear the superb Beale-Ampico.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Mr. Bartholomew Bakington
came to live in Sydney in 1816,
there can be little doubt but that
be fslt at first rather acutely the lack of
congenial society. It is not, in the natural
order of things, to be supposed that a dis-
tinguished scholar of the University of Cam-
bridge, a senior wrangler, a philosopher,
one who was something of a poet, a botanist
of reputation, a geologist, and an author of
abstruse little masterpieces of metaphysics
could have looked forward Avitli any confi-
dence to meeting in New South Wales with
men of his own sort. And it is quite certain
that Mr. Bakington did not do so. He came
here Avitli Ins eyes open. He Avas a person
who made a habit of keeping his eyes open,
and what they telegraphed to his brain was
ahvays'very thoroughly and sanely digested
by that remarkable mass of cerebral tissue.
There were, indeed, amongst the convicts
not a few people whose mentality and
accomplishments were on much the same
plane as Mr. Bakington’s. Consider, for
instance, Dr. Redferu and Mr. Francis
Howard Greemvay, the architect, avlio has
left so many noble memorials to himself and
Governor Macquarie throughout the old
County of Cumberland. They were both
men of more than considerable culture, but
the circumstance of their having been trans-
ported to these shores rendered Mr. Baking-
ton’s chances of getting to know them inti-
mately extremely remote. Dr. Redfern had
been a surgeon on a man-o’-war during the
mutiny at the Nore, and had been classed as
a mutineer, in all probability with the
utmost injustice. For concealing his effects
in bankruptcy, Greenway was invited to
visit Australia for a term of fourteen years.
If Mr. Bakington had cultivated the
acquaintance of either of them too con-
spicuously, he would have been invited to
keep away from the Mess of the 46th
Regiment. And he set such great store by
that pleasant resort that he was practically
debarred from the society of two of the
really best people in Sydney. And there
were others.
But there was another circumstance that
made Mr. Bakington’s life a peculiarly lonely
one. He was well off, had come to settle
in Australia, as the Blaxlands did, with the
best of introductions, was a generous and
high-minded man by nature, and enjoyed
every advantage that might be expected to
turn a settler into a good colonist. Yet
people instinctively shunned him. His
appearance was altogether against him.
He had an ungainly body—corpulent and
bandy-legged—and his face in profile was
most curiously and disastrously like that
of a pig. In spite of the fact that the
brain behind it was one of the highest
quality, his frontal bone sloped backwards
in a most absurd way. Although determina-
tion and courage were two of his strongest
characteristics, he had very little chin. His
nose was longi and his lips protruded. Mrs.
Macquarie, one of the kindest and gentlest
and most sympathetic of her sex, remarked
to her husband subsequent to his dining
at Government House soon after his arrival:
“My dear Lachlan—a charming man; a
delightful man. But, positively, I shudder
when I look at him!”
So in New South Wales, from his arrival
until 1846 when he died at Bathurst, Mr.
Bartholomew Bakington was ever alluded to
—behind his back—as “The Educated Pig.”
As he brought a good deal of capital into
the country, and was enthusiastic as to the
development of New South Wales in a
fashion that was after the Governor’s own
heart, Macquarie granted him 500 acres near
Mulgoa and 2000 on Bathurst Plains,
together with the labor of sufficient convicts
to work the two estates to the best advant-
age. His own shrewd commonsense and
inherent ability ensured that, from the very
beginning, he was a successful pioneer.
Without the characteristic selfishness of
John Macartliur, he had all John Mac-
arthur’s knowledge of how to get on in
Australia. Nothing that he undertook
failed of success. And whoever of intelli-
gence and discernment got to know the real
man that was behind the unkind mask that
Nature had inflicted upon him learned to
respect and admire him.
Unlike his friend Ensign Calder, Mr.
Wicks was not a young man who was abnor-
mally susceptible to the charms and lures
of womankind. “Oh, yes,” he would say
Avhen Mr. Calder’s latest passion was
under discussion, “the long-haired ones are
all right unless you take ’em at their own
value. A mistake to do that. Let a woman
suppose you’d die for her —and, damme, you
might just as well do so. And then you’re
done for. By Gad, I’d sooner be at sea all
the year round than go through what Patsy
does twice a month!”
Nevertheless it was to be showm that Lieu-
tenant Gregory Wicks, R.N., could fall very
violently and insanely in love Avhen fit occa-
sion presented itself. He would even outdo
Mr. Oalder when it came to the worst.
Captain William Blake, the Adjutant of
the 46th, suddenly interested Sydney society
by importing from Devonshire an extremely
pretty sister. He made the announcement
of her forthcoming arrival one evening to
Messrs. Pilkington, Wicks and Calder in Mr.
Calder’s quarters at the barracks, as the
four of them sat round a bowl of punch in
the enjoyment of tobacco, the interchange of
experiences and reminiscences and a discus-
sion of some of the minor problems of exist-
ence in New South Wales. It came out as
a sequel to an envious remark of Mr. Cal-
der’s concerning the great comfort, not to
say luxury, in which Mr. Pilkington lived
in his pretty cottage on the Rocks.
“You know,” he said, “Brummell here’s
a lucky dog to have such a jolly little place
to hang out in. This sort of thing”—he
waved his pipestem round the big bare room
—“is not much use to man or beast. A
fellow really needs an establishment. Don’t
you agree with me, sir?” he appealed to
Captain Blake.
“Oh yes, Calder—l do. Completely. One
gets most infernally tired of living in quar-
ters. After all, barrack life’s only a species
of privileged imprisonment. The convicts in
the gaol-gang are but a little worse off than
wo are. One becomes most intolerably tired
of living by bugle-call. Damnably so. My
idea of Heaven’s a place where you never
hear a bugle, a fife or a drum, and where
nobody ever returns a salute.”
“Oh well,” growled Mr. Wicks, “you’re
better off than we are on shipboard. Com-
pare the dog-hole in which I live on the Emu
with this apartment of Patsy’s.”
“Yes. That’s true enough,” rejoined the
Adjutant; “but then, my dear Wicks, you
are able to move your quarters about the
world, and to obtain some variety of out-
look. We can’t. Our lives are more or less
fenced in by the barrack walls. But if a
man lives in a place of his own, outside
’em, lie’s got a sort of city of refuge
where he can go and forget all
about soldiering for hours at a
time. I’m thinking of setting
up such a place myself.”
Mr. rilkington regarded
him solemnly, as he laid
his pipe upon the tabic
and ladled himself an-
other glass of punch.
“My dear Bill Blake,”
he drawled. “Don’t,
pleathe, inform nth
that you contemplate
matwimony!”
Captain Blake
laughed. “Well, why
not, my dear Arthur
—why not? Don’t
you think I could
persuade any woman
to put up wiih
A SPEED HOG ALL RIGHT.
“The only time you ever kiss me, dear, is when you want money.”
“Gracious! Don’t I ask often enough!”
me? As a matter of fact, however, I don’t
propose to become a benedict —not for a
while, at any rate. But my sister Honor’s
on her way out —she should be here in a
month or so. Then I’m going to set up
house somewhere, with her as housekeeper.
I trust I’ll often have the pleasure of enter-
taining you fellows. Pilkington, I look to
you to assist me in securing a residence.
Something big enough for the two of us—
but not too big.”
“I am entirely at your dithpothal, my dear
Blake,” responded Mr. Pilkington politely.
When the General Abercrombie dropped
anchor in Sydney Cove it so happened that
both Mr. Calder and Mr. Pilkington were
absent from Sydney on duty—the soldier at
Parramatta and the Actins-Deputy-Assistant-
Commissary-General at the new settlement
on George’s River, which his Excellency had
named Liverpool. Only Mr. Wicks remained
to represent the trio in extending a welcome
to Bill Blake’s sister.
They had each of them taken the liveliest
interest in the business of choosing a resi-
dence in which to instal the lady, and her
brother found the matter almost taken out
of his hands. Mr. Calder thought that a
suite of rooms above a saddler’s shop in
George-street, opposite the main gates ot
the Barracks, would be just the thing. Mr,
Pilkington favored the Rocks, because of the
freshness of the air in that desirable locality.
And Mr. Wicks considered that somewhere
on the shores of Sydney Cove was as good a
spot to live in as anywhere. Finally, a roomy
cottage with a wide verandah and a garden
in front of it was secured in King-street,
about half-way up the hill on the south side,
between Pitt- and Castlereagh-streets. And
then Captain Blake had the invaluable assist-
ance of Mr. Pilkington—whose discerning
elegance of taste in such matters was a
byword in Sydney —in furnishing the estab-
lishment.
When the General Abercrombie was sig-
nalled off the Heads one sunny spring morn-
ing Mr. Wicks obtained a day’s leave from
liis captain, borrowed that gentleman’s gig
and had himself rowed to the King’s Wharf,
whence he made his way as speedily as pos-
sible to Captain Blake’s new quarters.
Arrived there, he very generously proffered
the use of Captain Fletcher’s gig in bringing
Miss Blake and her belongings ashore —an
offer of service of which the Adjutant was
very glad to avail himself. They went off
together to the ship, where Captain Blake
walked into the cabin in quest of his sister,
leaving Mr. Wicks to await them on tho
quarter-deck.
It would possibly be an exaggeration to
suggest that Mr. Wicks knew his fate to be
sealed the moment that he beheld Honor
Blake, but it is none at all to say that
before the day was over he was head over
heels in love with the beautiful girl. No
one could look at Honor Blake without
experiencing something of the sort. Her
complexion was the best that' Devonshire
knows so well how to produce. Her hair
was a glorious auburn, and her laughing eyes
were as blue as the sky, or the waters that
reflected it in the Cove. Her figure was
perfect. And her manner was charming.
Mr. Wicks was not by any means a woman-
hater, in spite of the opinion which he is
quoted above as having expressed concerning
the opposite sex. He was a healthy and
handsome and gallant young seaman, and in
the course of three days he was in a state
and condition of infatuation with Miss Blake
such as Patrick Calder had never exceeded
in the most fervid of his adventures.
*}» ij®
“Brummell,” said Mr. Calder to Mr. Pil-
kington on his return from Parramatta, three
weeks later, as they listened to the band of
the 46th playing in Hyde Park towards the
close of the afternoon, “where the devil’s
Pansy? I haven’t seen anything of him
since I came back. Doesn’t he ever come
ashore these days. What’s the matter with
him ?”
Mr. Pilkington took a pinch of snuff with
great elegance, put his monocle into his left
eye-socket and surveyed his friend porten-
tously.
“The unfortunate Panthy, my dear Pat-
wick, ith, I wegwet to tliay, totally lotht to
uth. Bill Blake’th thithter !”
He took a scrap of paper from his waist-
coat pocket, unfolded it, and handed it to
Mr. Calder. This is what that gentleman
read with much disgust:—
Oh fairer than the stars that shine at night;
Most beautiful and rare, I look to thee
To lead me, falt’ring to the Realm of Light,
Where I may strive one fleeting gleam to see
Of that sweet happiness
“O my God!” groaned Mr. Calder, crump-
ling the paper up and throwing it sway.
“Damme, I'd never have thought it of him !
Where is he now, Brummell? Have you any
idea?”
Mr. Pilkington smiled. “Any idea, Pat-thy?
I thould watlier think I have. We will go
theek the poet. ’Twill .edify you gweatly
to behold our Panthy in hith pwethent
beatific thtatc.”
“Where is he?”
“Where thould he be but in the bower of
Venuth, tranthfickth through his bleeding
heart by one of Cupidtli darth. Thighing,
vowing and pwotethting tlientimenth of
undying devotion to the object of hith adora-
tion. I have not the leatht doubt but that
if we walk down to Bill Blake’th houthe
Wig’ll find the lovelorn thwain at the feet of
hith Ilonowia. Come, let uth go theek the
thlave of Love.”
They passed by the new courthouse with
its half-completed walls fenced in with tall
scaffolding, and turned into King-street. As
they came round the corner they were hailed
from the opposite side of the street. It
was the voice of Mr. Wicks. He came across
the roadway and joined them.
“Where are you two off to?” he growled.
“Hullo, Pansy, why so overcast with
gloom?” Mr. Calder greeted his friend.
“Aren’t ye going to say ‘how-de-do’ to a
fellow after all these weeks? I hear you’ve
been cultivating the muse. Brummell
here”
“Oh, shut up. Where are you going?”
“I am taking Patwick,” interposed Mr.
Pilkington, “to call upon Mith Blake. He
hath not yet paid hith wethpecth to her.”
“Oh, be d —d,” grunted Mr. Wicks—-“l’m
going there myself. You two’d better stay
away. I don’t want you.”
“Panthy, my dear Panthy,” protested Mr.
Pilkington. “Don’t be abthurd. Of courtin',
Patwick hath to make hith bow to Mith
Blake. ’Twould be motht impolite of him
not to take the firtht opportunity of doing
tho. Not only a thlight to the lady, but
altho to our vewy good fwiend her bwother.
Come, leth all go to Myrtle Cottage. And
do twy to look ath if you w.eren’t going to
be hanged, Panthy, my buck.”
The First Lieutenant of the Emu fell in
beside them, and they walked down the hill
to Captain Blake’s garden gate. As they
advanced up the narrow pathway in single
file, Mr. Wicks in the lead, they heard voices
through the open window of the front room.
Mr. Wicks checked for a moment and grew
very red in the face. Then he marched
up to the door, and rattled the knocker.
In a few seconds the door was opened, and
in the doorway stood that grotesque carica-
ture of humanity Mr. Bartholomew Baking-
ton. Behind him the pretty face and
glorious auburn hair of Miss Honor Blake
became visible. She smiled sweetly at them,
Avhilst Mr. Bakington extended his hand,
and grasped that of Mr. Wicks, which was a
little limp.
“Dear me, we’re delighted to see you—
aren’t we, dear?”
. Mr. Wicks started and stiffened.
Mr. Bakington made way for Miss Blake,
who stepped out on to the verandah, where
Mr. Pilkington presented the admiring Mr.
Calder. And then Mr. Wicks’s world ex-
ploded into fragments about his ears.
“Barty, dear,” she said, “I think we might
tell them, don’t you?”
“Certainly, Honor—why not? Such dear
friends of your brother’s. Do. Or shall I?”
“You tell them,” said the lady a little
shyly, looking down and blushing in a pretty
confusion.
Mr. Bakington cleared his throat. “Well
—-er —gentlemen—the fact is, we’re delighted
that you should be the first to hear of our
engagement. We are—Miss con-
sented to make me the happiest mortal in
existence. Pray congratulate me. I—why,
what’s the matter, Wicks?”
“Pray excuse me, I am unwell,” gasped
Mr. Wicks. He turned about, and literally
bolted down the garden path and through
the gateway into King-street.
Half an hour afterwards • Mr. Pilkington
and Mr. Calder took their departure. As
they walked down to Pitt-street Mr. Calder
exploded into mirth.
“My holy aunt! Poor old Pansy! To be
cut out by the Educated Pig! Oh, by the
Lord!”
But Mr. Pilkington was serious. “Don’t
laugh, Patwick. Let uth go and thee if
we can find Panthy’th body.”

How can we make cement bricks? Fro-
portions of sand and cement to be used? Is
clean sharp sand needed? What is the most
approved size of such bricks f—2B6o.
The Truline Co., Commercial Bank Cham-
bers, George-street, Sydney, has a portable
machine that makes a brick same size as
the ordinary clay brick. McKay Construe-
tions, Ltd., 5 Hamilton-street, Sydney, has
a portable mould which makes a block 18 x
6 and either 3,4 or 6in. thick. The Truline
Co. does building on contract; the McKay
Constructions will either work on contract
or rent the mould. The usual mixture is
one part of cement to two of sand and four
parts of crushed stone, pebbles, coke breeze
or clinkers. The size of the coarse aggregate
depends on the thickness of the block, a good
general rule being the diameter of the aggre-
gate to be not more than 1-5 (one-fifth) of
the thickness of the block. The amount of
water is important, as both these machines
require a semi-dry mixture. The proper
consistency is that which when some of
the mixture is squeezed tight in the hand
it retains its shape, like damp sand. A
booklet called * “The Making of Good Con-
crete” has been posted. A trade opinion is
that the larger-size block will be less ex-
pensive to place in the wall than the small
brick, but the appearance is not so good,
except for large buildings.

At present there is no clause of this nature
in the Wireless Act, and any person experi-

My tomato plants turn yellow at the bot-

If specimens of the tomato plants are for-
warded to the N.S.W. Agriculture Depart-
meat a determination of the cause of the
trouble might be made . T he plants may be
affec ted with fusarium wilt, caused by a para-
sitic fungus which is able to “live over” in
the soil. Control measures include the re-
moval and destruction of diseased plants and
crop rotations. Wilt-resistant varieties may
be grown on badly infested soil, but as a
rule are not good croppers. Better results
arc obtained by growing commercial varieties
on so il s not infested with the disease. A
leaflet on “Wilts and Root Rot” has been
posted.

What are the chances, prospects and
opportunities for a man of forty, with a fair
education and a strong inclination for reading
laws and statutes, of becoming a barrister?
And how would he proceed? —2672.
Not encouraging, unless, perhaps, with fair
education is a body of exceptional knowledge
in some branch of mercantile life or in tech-
nical or industrial matters that would en-
able the barrister to specialise. The exams.
to be passed would be (1) a preliminary or
law matric., the subjects in which are Latin,
geometry, algebra, history and either Greek
or French or logic and psychology (a leav-
ing certificate covering these subjects is
equivalent) ; (2) an intermediate or law
history exam.; and (3) a final divided into
two sections and covering generally the body
of Common and Statute law and Equity.
The address of the secretary to the Board
of Examiners is the Supreme Court, Sydney.
(1) What are the usual terms on which
English publishers accept novels? (2) How
does one go about the business? (3) Must
it be typed? —3oll.
(1) The most common agreement is for
payment on a royalty basis. The author
receives from 10 to 15 per cent, on the net
price of each copy sold. If the author is
fairly well known he receives a sum down
on account of royalties. On a 7s. 6d. novel
15 per cent, on 100 copies means £56 55.;
10 per cent, means £37 10s. Generally
there is an advance in the royalty paid after
three or four thousand copies are sold, but
novels by unknown writers seldom go beyond
1000. If the subject does not look attrac-
tive the publisher will probably ask for a
guarantee against loss. Stanley Unwin’s
“The Truth About Publishing” and Michael
Joseph’s “The Commercial Side of Litera-
ture” are illuminating works to read on the
subject. (2) May be best to send to a
literary agent. (3) Most publishers prefer
novels typed.
I would like to get some information with
reference to fish which fell in a shower of
rain, I think at Glengallen Station ( Q .),
some tiventy-five years ago. Have there been
falls of fish in other places? —2766.
No record is available concerning the
phenomenon at Glengallen Station. Such
cases, however, have been reported from
several sources. A reliable case of a shower
of fish occurred at Carrigabolt Castle, County
Clare, Ireland, on June 15, 1895, when some
small fish from 11 to 2 inches long fell with
a short shower. See also Argus (Melb.),
19/11/’2O and 20/10/'2O.
(1) Is there any insurance co. in Austra-
lia doing cyclone or flood insurance? (2)
If not in Australia, where? (3) Who would,
be the best person to get in touch with in
reference to this class of business? —29o3.
This Department got in touch with al! the
leading accident offices, including Lloyds, but
none handle cyclone or flood insurance. Some
reader may know more than we have been
able to find out.
(1) Is there a market for snake-skins, as
used for shoe leather, in Australia? (2)
Are the skins of tiger, black, carpet and whip
snakes suitable? (3) Is the skin or hide of
the goanna suitable? (4) Hoic would you
treat skins for tanning or curing? —29o4.
(1) There has been a very keen demand,
but at present reptile shoes are very hard
to sell, and it look,s as though the fashion
has gone for the time being. Wilcox, Mofflin,
Ltd., 247 George-street, Sydney, will pro-
bably sell for you. (2) Carpet-snakes are
the most favored. The size in width is very
important; Sin. wide for the greater part of
the skin is essential. Dark skins are not
liked. (3) No; too coarse and scaly, and
not sufficient cutting for bag work. (4) Alum
and salt curing is now the general practice,
a recipe for which was printed in the Ser-
vice Page l/12/’27 (clipping posted).

(1) Was Sarajevo, where the heir to the
Austrian throne teas murdered in July, 1914.
in Austrian or Serbian territory? (2) What
were the conditions demanded by Austria in
the Note sent to Serbia? (3) llow did the
Serbian Government reply? —2969.
(1) At the time it was the capital of Bos-
nia and Herzegovina, then provinces of
Austria-Hungary. (2) The Austrian Note
required that Serbia should first publish an
official condemnation of Serbian propaganda
against Austria-Hungary, regret for the part
taken by Serbians in this propaganda and a
promise of amendment; suppression of news-
papers which incited to hatred and contempt
of the monarchy; elimination from public
instruction in Serbia (including the teaching
body) of anything that served as propaganda
against Austria-Hungary; removal from
army and administration of officials guilty
of such propaganda whose names might he
communicated by the Austro-Hungarian
Government; collaboration in Serbia of Aus-
tro-Hungarian representatives for the sup-
pression of such propaganda. (3) Every
demand was granted except two: the dis-
missal of unspecified officials and officers and

2807. —To preserve loganberries. It can
be done in either plain water or syrup. Heat
liquid t,o about 140 deg. P. Heat screw-topped
jars in oven. Remove and pack fr.uit into
them as tightly as possible. A little practice
at this will enable you to pack a much larger
quantity than at a cursory glance seems pos-
sible. The tighter the better. After tilling,
pour heated liquid into jars to about a
quarter of an inch from the top ; then screw
lids on just loose. Take a laundry tub and
roughly cover bottom with boards ; place jars
therein, upright, and pack straw or rags
around so that no two jars are touching.
Pour in sufficient warm water (about ITOdeg.
F. ) to reach just below caps. Allow to sim-
mer very gently for about 20 minutes. At the
end of 10 minutes remove each jar and screw-
down as tightly as possible. This will ensure
a vacuum in jars after cooling. This method
is the most satisfactory for all fruits. Pre-
serving without sugar is quite good enough
for fruits required for pies, etc., sugar to be
added when finally cooking. For dessert
fruits, lib. of sugar to each gallon of water
is the correct quantity. Do not remove from
tub when cooked until the whole is thoroughly
cooled. Store in a dark cupboard in coolest
place available. —“Eromeno.”

a great new Companion Invention
to the Super-Six Principle
HUDSON excels
HUDSON itself

Under this combination n) resources, American and
Australian industry has achieved manufacturing
economies that no other builder for the Australian
market shares.

Prices at some points slightly higher.
This new companion invention adds a further step in efficiency
by actually converting hitherto wasted heat into useful power.
With the Super-Six Principle, which converts to useful power
energy that in other types is lost in vibration, the new Hudson
invention combines the highest efficiency in power, smoothness
and long motor life ever achieved within our knowledge.
Added Fuel Economy —Greater Power
Steam Engine Smoothness
In all previous types of car
motors a High percentage of
the power of the fuels is lost
in heat thrown away in the
exhaust and cooling waters.
The new Hudson motor gives
the snap and performance of
the high compression type
without sacrifice of flexibility
and smoothness.
Spark knock is positively pre-
vented. Regular petrol gives
the performance sought, in
other types, through the use of
special and costly fuels. The
cold motor starts with the
same snap you get from other
types in midsummer. You
don’t have to wait for or nurse
your motor while it warms up.
Oil dilution is prevented.
Greater power, speed and fuel
economy are obtained. Every
phase of performance is brilli-
antly better. These two Hud-
son inventions give a perform-
ance and reliability supremacy
that are immediately and con-
tinuously apparent whether
you drive your Hudson a city
block or a hundred thousand
miles. You need but a single
demonstration to give you
such a conviction of superi-
ority as you never experienced
in any motor-car.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
At the yearling sales in 1926, F. Gahan,
a Sydney bookmaker, gave 500 guineas for a
natty brown gelding by Greenstead —Lile-
acre. It was the top price for a Greenstead,
although The Welkin’s brilliant son had
begun to make a name for himself as a sire;
and the youngster, now named Bawn-a-glas,
has turned out a cheap horse. At Moore-
iield on Saturday he won a mile handicap
for three- and four-year-olds in taking style,
after having been backed from sevens and
sixes to 9 to 2. Jazz Baby, the favorite,
was beaten into fourth place; Desdemona
(7 to 1) was second and Ariedon (5 to 1)
third, but neither gave backers of Bawn-a-
glas, who carried 41b. over-weight, cause
for a moment’s anxiety.
Cave Dweller (evens), a good horse at
Moorefield, where he is trained, made every
post a winner in the 10-furlong handicap.
He was stopping at the finish, and his party
had reason to be thankful to Pike, who. gave
an excellent exhibition of the art of riding
a waiting race in front. Blather (15 to 1)>
the runner-up, is a young Magpie gelding
who is on the improve. Young Lillyman was
also seen to advantage on Greenie (5 to 2)
in the first division of the Flying Handicap;
his skilful handling of the Greenstead mare,
who is very fast for five furlongs and then
begins to tire, was largely responsible for
her narrow defeat of Bavermaine (9 to 2),
a very unlucky mare. The second division of
this race was won, and won well, by Justify
(3 to 1), a candidate for the Adrian Knox
Stakes. By Archery (imp.)—Taringamatu,
she is owned by J. J. Leahy and trained by
D. Lewis, the same as Genuine.
H. J. Carew, one of the N.S.W. trainers
who have migrated to Melbourne, made a
brief return recently with a chestnut called
Murrumboo, and started him in a division
of the Maiden Handicap. Portion of the
substantial commission was placed at 7 to 1,
and the closing price was 7 to 4. With
Cracknell and 51b. extra aboard, Murrumboo
deprived Vanished of the lead at three
longs, and was four lengths ahead of Dick
Wootton’s squibby mare at the end of six
furlongs—he could have made it 10 lengths
with little difficulty. He has an unfashion-
able pedigree, being by Crusoe, a son of
Maltster, out of a mare called Gamaches,
but he is pretty good all the same.
* * * *
The withdrawal of Lesboo from the Chal-
lenge Stakes, to be run at Randwick on
Saturday, suggests that his party intends
keeping him for the Doncaster at Easter,
and perhaps his party is wise. The Chal-
lenge looks an open race. Wliitta (Bst. 51b.),
Chrystal (Bst. 31b.) and Royal Tune (7st.
sib.) have strong claims, and Greenline
(Bst. 121 b.) may do better than in the Car-
rington Stakes; the handicapper obviously
has a respect for this Greenstead gelding.
Tote possibilities for Saturday, and an early
Anniversary Handicap selection :
Three-year-old Handicap: Sion; next,
Rozener.
Challenge Stakes: Greenline; next,
Whitta.
January Handicap: Don Panther; next,
Ulah or Night Heron.
Welter: Ulah or Irish Prince; next, Gold-
beater.
Anniversary Handicap: Honan; next,
Amusement.
* * * ❖
Spearset, who set up such a long lead in
the Bagot Handicap at Flemington on New
Year’s Day, only to be beaten in the last
few yards by Textile, looked a pretty good
bet for the 10-furlongs handicap at Aspen-
dale Park on Saturday. David Garrick, how-
ever, was favorite at 3 to 1, Spearset being
at 7 to 2 ; others backed were Lady Hooka
and Chickling (5 to 1) and Tullius (7 to
1). Flemington form proved trustworthy,
for Spearset won a. good race by a head from
the fast-finishing Chickling, who was three-
quarters of a length in front of Tullius.
Spearset is a brother to Spearer, and is
improving with age. He is owned by H. A.
Underwood and F. P. Smith and trained by
R. Sinclair, and was ridden on this occasion
by little Downey.
There was a great finish in the two-year-
old race, heads separating Mathew (8 to 1),
Anax and Unique. The winner belongs to
Otway Falkiner, and is by Grey Monk out
of Don Moon’s dam; Cecil Godby trains
him. That sweet little galloper Lady Yar-
borough (7 to 2) made one act of the Plate,
in which Fortafest (15 to 1) and Triilo
A BIT BOTH WAYS..
Friend: “You’ve got a chance of winning five thousand with that ticket."
Scot: “An’ if I don’t win it, wull they gi’e me back my ft’ bob?"
(10 to 1) followed her home at a respectful
distance. Parsee (9 to 2), an imported four-
year-old, had almost as easy a time in a
division of the Trial Welter. He is by
King Sol—Pusing Lama, and should suc-
ceed in much stronger company than he met
on Saturday.
* * * *
“Tuart”: Zora Cross was among the
winners at the W.A. Turf Club’s meeting
in Perth on Saturday, and the dividends
amply rewarded the patrons of literature
who supported her —they were £2l 12s. for
10s. on the straightout tote and £4 7s.
(also for 10s.) on the place machine. Zora
is by Poetical out of Ffeerique, which is
French for “fairy” used as an adjective, or
“enchanting.” Admirers of The Bulletin’s
Zora Cross will agree that the mare is well
named. Apropos, a horse called Red Page
has won a few races in Victoria. He is
by Duke of Melton —Inky Way.
* * * *
“Ula”: Earle Sande. most famous of U.S.
jockeys, has lost his license, which means, I
suppose, that his career in the saddle has
finished, as that of Tod Sloan did in similar
circumstances. Tim Simmons became ac-
quainted with Sande when the Melbourne
jockey rode in the U.S., and describes him as
a really great horseman. In 10 years the
American had 3425 mounts for 921 winners;
one was Zev when that horse defeated Papy-
rus, the English Derby winner. At the
moment Duncan is Australia’s most success-
ful jockey. His record falls short of Sanders,
however; in 12 years he has had 3554
mounts, of which 591 have been winners.
* * * *
“Ike Mcßagg” : A sad case of official per-
secution came to light in Brisbane recently,
when a venerable sportsman of 79 was fined
75 of the best for running a betting joint, it
being his fourth conviction in two years.
In vain did the old gentleman plead that he
laid the odds not . because he liked doing it
but because of harsh necessity. What else,
he asked the beak, was he to do? Go to the
Old Men’s Home at Dunwich, and there
become a burden on the country? Perish
the thought! That is the true spirit. Better
for a man to wear himself out in the service
of the people than to billet himself on the
State. If this doyen of the profession grew
weary of well-doing, who would be left in
his neighborhood—his business was largely
domestic in character —to enable thrifty
housewives to invest the money that would
otherwise be wasted on grasping- butchers
and bakers, or to provide little Johnny with
a healthier means of spending his penny than
the purchase of an “all-day sucker” or some
aniline-tinted atrocity of a similar nature?
“Invest” I say advisedly—it is the verb
invariably used by democratic politicians
when extending the facilities for indulging in
little flutters.
* * * *
“Thormanby”: In spite of modern inno-
vations the Gaming Act still stands good in
Britain. A firm of bookmakers went to the
County Court in the hope of establishing the
principle that under the new taxation law
backers could no longer plead the Gaming
Act to avoid payment of lost wagers. The
firm had paid the tax on the particular bet
instanced, and claimed that it was therefore
entitled to recover. Defendant admitted the
debt, said he couldn’t pay, and refused to
consent to judgment for the amount. The
Judge declared that he could not make any
order unless the defendant agreed to it,
and that as far as the bookies were con-
cerned the taxation law made them liable
for tax on a wager which they had been
unable to collect. The case is full of interest
for the fraternity which lays ’em and takes
’em on the nod in this country. The ruling
is in advance of anything yet laid down here.
Bagmen are taxed in Australia, and in the
light of the English decision if they can get
the man who takes the knock to consent to
judgment they can recover, if there is any-
thing to recover on. All the same, betting
on the nod is due for abolition either by
agreement among the Tommies or by Govern-
ment enactment. One of the advantages of
the tote is that it doesn’t accept bets on
the nod.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Ted Monson (list. 31b.), who is claimed
by Westralia and South Aus., furnished a
surprise by whipping Gordon Kiely (list.
4Mb.) at the Leichhardt Stadium on Friday
night. The Victorian had been beating a
succession of good men, while Monson was
supposed to be past his prime. It was Mon-
son’s fight all the way, and the referee inter-
vened in the tenth round. Gordon had been
floored for nine seconds in the previous
round, and was falling out of the ring when
the official stopped the trouble.
* * * *
Johnnie Sullivan (list. Bilb. at 2 p.m.)
made his debut at the Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night opposed to Bruno Frattini
(list. 51b., same time) and pleased every-
one but the Frattini party with his fast
hitting and clever evasion of the heavy
swings fired in his direction. Frattini is a
second Joe Grim for toughness and is splen-
didly game. He took a fierce hiding without
being able to do much damage in return,
though he split an Irish eyebrow in round
nine. His own brows needed stitching after
the turmoil. Sullivan’s work was vastly
interesting, and his lightning jabs and clean
right-hand punching would have probably
settled a less-tough opponent before the end
of the 15th round. There was a large attend-
ance, as these things go nowanights, and the
verdict for the Irishman was highly popular.
* * * *
Improving greatly on his first showing
in Sydney, Aides, the Filipino lightweight,
outpointed Norman Gillespie at Melbourne
Stadium on Saturday. With a swift and
accurate left and a skip out of range he had
the paleface puzzled in the early rounds, and
a long right spread' Gillespie on the canvas
for a short count in the fifth round. From
the ninth round onwards the pair made it
very willing, and the small crowd urged
them on to still greater efforts. In the
eleventh Aldes’s chin collected the best punch
of the fight—a perfectly Aimed right that
made the brown boy roll his eyes; but before
Gillespie could press his advantage the bell
called a halt. Norman made up a lot of
leeway in the later rounds, but the decision
in favor of the visitor was well received.
Aides came in at 9st. 61b.; Gillespie, who
was a 5-to-2-on favorite, scaled 9st. O^lb.

Tom Ileeney fought a draw with Jack
Sharkey at New York last week. Sharkev
was the better boxer, but the Maorilander
landed hard and often, and took all that
came his way unflinchingly. Many thought
he should have got the decision, and that is
evidently promoter Rickard’s opinion, for he
has announced that Heeney will figure in
another “elimination bout” on March 20.
This is contrary to his original idea of cut-
ting out both Pleeney and Sharkey as claim-
ants to a match for the championship in case
of a draw. There were 17,000 at the fight
in Madison-square Garden.
“Mitt Shover” : To the experts on this side
who could see no good in Heeney two or three
years ago, his steady rise to his present
eminence in his noble profession must seem
in the worst of taste. But some people
have absolutely no consideration for the
feelings and reputations of others.
* * * *
Billy Grime, of whom little has been heard
for months, has fought a six-round draw in
New York with one Bobby Nelson, described
as “negro junior lightweight champion,”
whatever that may be. Grime’s elusive
methods had the coon missing frequently, but
the darky’s punch was much the more con-
vincing when it did land, and the judges
agreed that one offset the other. Boxing a
few rounds every four or five months, as he
has been doing, Grime can’t be expected to
beat" front-rank Americans who fight every
week or so and are younger than the River-
ina pug, as a rule. Constant fighting is the
secret of Tom Heeney’s success.
* * * *
“Broken Nose”: A young boxer died after
a bout at Bathurst the other Saturday night.
A week later the same thing happened at
Dubbo, the victim in this case being a lad of
18. If boxers were protected under the
Workers’ Compensation Act, promoters
would be more careful about matching them
and seeing that they were in proper con-
dition and were not subjected to brutal pun-
ishment -when they were past defending them-
selves. But in the interests of the promot-
ing gentry, the late unlamented Labor Gov-
ernment carefully excluded boxers from the
much-advertised benefits of the Act. There
was a time when everyone present at a
boxing fatality was liable to a charge of man-
slaughter. Perhaps that view of the situa-
tion ought to be revived.

“An easy ’orse ’e is to ride;
Don’t bustle ’im,” was wliat ’e said.
“Just let ’ im get into ’is stride
And, turned for ’ome, give ’im ’is ’ead,
And shake the whip at ’im a bit;
Y’ll ’ardly need to use the ’ooks.
E’ knows the way, and you can sit
And watch ’im tickle up the books.”
That’s while ’e’s fiddlin’ with the lead —
“An easy ’orse to ride,” ’e said.
“The way some ’andle ’im’s a crime,
They ride ’im right into the ground.
Don’t bustle ’im—just give ’im time
To get ’is balance, son, and round
The turn is plenty soon enough
To think of sendin’ ’im along.
And then ’e don’t want treatin’ rough ;
Y’ needn’t fret —’e’ll come ’ome strong.”
’ls face was angry-like and red;
“The way some ’andle ’im!” ’e said.
“Don’t bustle ’im ; ’e’s got the guts
To finish like a blazin’ streak,
While some of these four-legged mutts
Are down the straight about a week.”
’E’s talkin’ still and talkin’ loud
As ever when ’e ’ands me up,
And all around the nosey crowd
Just laps it like a thirsty pup.
Ah, ’strutli! The guyver that ’e shed!
I knew the flamin’ ’orse was dead —

The Ins and Outs
Queensland made a bad first-innings start
in the Sheffield Shield match in Brisbane, the
side collapsing for 144, after winning the
toss and going in. R. Oxenham (-6) ai d
skipper O Connor (46) were the only bats-
men to put up a showing till Beeston (1* )
and Amos (20) made a plucky stand tor tne
last wicket. Suott, \\ all and Grimmett
caused the trouble. Scott took tor <,
Wall 4 for 43, and Grimmett 4 tor
62. South Aus. had lost Vic Richardson
(0) and Harris (61) for 126 when stumps
were drawn, so only 270 runs were put on in
the whole of the first day. At the end
of the second day S.A., thanks chiefly to
Schneider (114), Hack (77), Alexander
(62) and Sangster (62), had a lead of 2Jo
with four wickets in hand.
* * * *
“Mid-Channel”: Concerning Hornibrook
(B. 12/l/’2B). Before the last Australian
eleven was selected I asked a famous
cricketer (name given, but not for publica-
tion, of course) what chance Hornibrook
had. He said “None,” and gave as a reason
that the Queenslander bowled round the
wicket, instead of over it. It was a fatal
defect, ho added, since English umpires would
not give an l.b.w. decision in favor of that
class of bowler.
* * * *
“McGoogle”: Arthur Mailey has “a good
press.” He seldom comes off nowadays, but
never an inter-State match goes by without
one or other of the loyal Sydney dailies
asserting that “Mailey bowled splendidly.”
In Sheffield Shield matches last season the
slow bowler took 12 wickets at 54.08 ; this
season he has taken 14 at 53.57. He expressed
his intention of retiring after the last Eng-
lish tour, and in a sense it is a pity that
lie stayed on, for he has done some great
things for Australian cricket when there
was a good fast bowler at the other end.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: Though Victoria has yet
to face N.S.W. and Queensland on their
own grounds, where it was defeated last
year, the abiding-place of the Sheffield
Shield is settled as far as the next season
is concerned. Up to the finish of the
N.S.W.-Q. match in Sydney, the southern-
ers had 16 points, N.S.W. and South
Aus. 8 each and Queensland 4. There is a
doleful contrast between the batting aver-
ages and those of most of the bowlers.
Ponsford has the astonishing figures o<f
229.2, and Woodfull is also over the 100
mark—ll7.s. Blackie heads the bowling
averages with 23 wickets at 17.78, though
the highest total of wickets stands to the
credit of Grimmett —29 at 25.7. Among
the fast bowlers, Morton leads with 22
wickets for 21.81 each. In his single
Sheffield Shield essay, the young ’Awkes-
bury giant Nicholls took 9 at 22.11.
* * * *
“Ikey G. Grace”: The three _ Sheffield
Shield games played in Victoria this season
brought in £7596 6s. 9d. —one result of the
time-limit which has made matches more
interesting in every respect. The V.,C,A. has
resolved to engage a first-class professional
coach for next season, and has,set aside £5OO
for distressed cricketers. Also, a team is to
be sent to Westralia in February, and the
association is considering the granting of an
extra 15s. per day to the State cricketers
included in the Australian team to tour
Maoriland, a parsimonious Board of Control
having fixed their remuneration at a paltry
15 bob. Further, some recognition of Pons-
ford’s scores has been decided upon. Whether
it will take the form of a statue or a rule
providing for enlarging the wickets while
he is batting is not yet known.
* * * *
“A.H.S.”: Tell “W.1.U.” (B. 29/12/’27)
that a matting-covered mud wicket plays
much more truly than the usual matting-
covered concrete wicket, which is too lively
altogether. The mud wicket is the nearest
approach to turf plumbness that you can
get.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The good feeling that has
always existed between N.S.W. and Victorian
cricket-writers has not been lessened by the
number of l.b.w. decisions given against
N.S.W. in the Sheffield Shield match between
the two States in Melbourne. Commenting
on the N.S.W.-Queensland match in Syd-
ney one of the experts remarked on the irri-
tating business of appealing for l.b.w. on the
slightest pretext. “One does not know,” he
went on, “whether the habit has been copied
from the Victorian fieldsmen.” Yah !
$ He $ $
“Status”: Canberra, which demanded re-
presentation on the Board of Control as a
sovereign State, or something of the sort, and
was told to go away and grow up, has
decided to sink its status for the time being
and apply for affiliation with the N.S.W.
C.A. The incident shows how the charac-
teristic spirit of a bureaucracy has caught
hold of even cricket in Canberra. For,
though they don’t seem to be aware of it,
the Canberries were admitted to the N.S.W.
C.A. some months ago with the status of
a country association, as reference to the
N.S.W. C.A.'s annual report will show.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cut Shot”: The Davis Cup selectors
recommended G. L. Patterson (Vic.), J.
Crawford (N.S.W.), H. Hopman (N.S.W.),
J. B. Hawkes (Vic.) and E. F. Moon (Q.)
in that order, leaving it to the A.L.T.A.
Council to decide whether three, four or five
should be sent. The council approved of the
selection as regards the first three, and
deferred the question of appointing a fourth
man until after the Australian champion-
ships. Patterson was appointed captain, as
well as manager, of the team. His idea at
present is to play in the doubles with Hop-
man, and nominate that young man and
Crawford to tackle the singles. Such self-
abnegation is rare in the lawn-tennis world.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro.” : As expected, the Council
of the A.L.T.A. turned down J. O. Anderson’s
request for reinstatement as an amateur.
No other decision was possible, for the
applicant insisted on being permitted to
retain a salary paid him by a sporting-goods
firm for the use of his name on one of their
racquets. This has been specifically de-
clared an act of professionalism by the Inter-
national Federation. However, Anderson
was given to understand that, if he ceased
to godfather the racquet and promised to
observe all the other rules of amateurism,
a probationary period might be fixed if he
renewed his application.
* * * *
The country tennis matches which have
been raging at Rushcutter Bay, Sydney, con-
cluded on Saturday. The teams champion-
ship was won by the Williams brothers, of
Barraba, after a great battle with Gossage
and Kennedy, the hurricane hitters from
Mudgee. F. Kalms recaptured the country
singles championship, beating W. F. Med-
ealf, who had disposed of Guy Williams in
the final; and with J. O’Ryan Kalms won
the doubles from the Williams brothers.
Partnered by Miss Cox, he was also success-
ful in the mixed doubles. The ex-Davis Cup
TO ONE THING CONSTANT EVER.
BILLEE: “Have you ever seen Doris with another boy?”
OBBEE: “Never! She’s the sort of girl that would insist on being rescued by the same
life-saver every time.”
player has never been seen to better advan-
tage. W. B. Walker again won the country
junior singles, heating N. Ridley, the Can-
berra crack; both are promising youngsters,
the Windsor lad especially. Miss Cox was
foremost among the ladies, with Miss Luckie
next.
* * * *
“Pothunter”: The French Lawn Tennis
Federation announces that it has received
21 entries for the Davis Cup, 18 in the
European zone. The South Africans, like
the Australians, will play in Europe. A
new challenger in the American section is
China. If there are players as good as Lum
in the Flowery Land they won’t be disgraced.
* * * *
“Centurion”: There is a lot of interest in
Jean Borotra’s admission to an American
interviewer that he laid the foundations of
his tennis on pclota. Borotra is a Basque,
and pelota is the national game of that
curious people. It is played by two or four
players —the latter in pairs—on a long open-
air court, across one end of which is a high
wall. Against this the hard and heavy ball
is played with the “pelota,” a curious sickle-
shaped cylinder of basketwork and leather,
open at. the end and the upper side and
fastened to the player’s hand and forearm.
The ball is caught off the wall and hurled
back again with tremendous force, the fore-
court being subdivided for scoring purposes
as in tennis. Matches are usually played
for side-wagers; in fact, the gambling is hot
and heavy.
* * * *
“The Deuce”: Carrying Freetrade prin-
ciples to extraordinary the Wimble-
don authorities have engaged Karel Kozeluh
to coach the English Davis Cup team.
Kozeluh turned pro. with Suzanne Lenglen,
and toured England with the volcanic dam-
sel last year. Since then lie has done well
as a professional, being champion of France.
He was engaged by the Berlin club as coach
at a salary of £5O per week, and lias been
released for the English engagement, which
is to last six weeks from April 2. Apart
from the preference to the imported article,
the departure is a staggering one for such
a conservative organisation as Wimbledon
has proved itself to be.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The Victorian tennis authori-
ties have published a ranking list of the
first 10 Vic. players, based on performances
during the last 12 months. It runs: Pat-
terson, O’Hara Wood, Hawkes, Haege, Mc-
Innes, Fitchett, Clemenger, Dickinson, Wer-
theim and Teague. Miss Boyd, Mrs. Harper
and Mrs. O’Hara Wood are the first three
in the women’s list. Hacge’s prominence has
surprised some people, but it should not be
forgotten that this youngster was reckoned
superior to Crawford and Hopman a couple
of seasons ago. He is going to try his luck
at Wimbledon this year.
* * * *
“Hush-Hush”: The English tennis world
is all of a flutter since the secret is out that
Betty Nuthall has been developing an over-
head service. The thing is not to be exhi-
bited in public till the Riviera tournaments,
Helen Wills being, presumably, the victim
on which it is to be sprung. It is said that
the new equipment is fast and accurate, but
some of the prophets are averring that Betty
will regret abandoning her underhand
service, which puzzled the best of them, pro-
bably by reason of its infernal simplicity,
just as the worst ball of a cricket match
sometimes gets rid of the best batsman.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Q.N.” : The Yarra Yarra (Vic.) club has
a new rule which provides that “until Feb-
ruary 29, 1928, members playing in a com-
petition may, after completing either the
10th or the 18th hole, discontinue play with-
out penalty for the purpose of obtaining
liquid refreshment.” Is it necessary to men-
tion that Yarra Yarra has a license?
* * * *
“P.0.H.”: As a counterblast to the asser-
tion of H. O. Allan, Vic. Under Sec. for
Lands, that golf is not a game but a Cere-
mony or an Institution (B. 12/l/’2B), Pri-
minister Bruce has declared that it is the
world’s best and only game. He spoke in
recess, of course, aqd the occasion on which
he let himself go was ceremonial, if not insti-
tutional. The scene was Cowes, Phillip
Island—-not far from where Earl Strad-
broke’s gent, help struck him in the eye witli
a tennis ball.
* * * *
“Iconoclast”: According to an English
authority who has been visiting America,
if British golfers are to regain their old
supremacy they must think of golf as the
Americans think of it, “in terms of "pars,'
‘birdies’ and ‘eagles’,” and act accordingly.
A “par,” it seems, is the perfect score for
a hole; a “birdie” is one stroke under
“par”; an “eagle” is one stroke under the
“birdie.” What fowl is invoked as a god-
father for anything better than the “eagle’
is not stated, though the whole thing brings
the laughing-jackass irresistibly to mind.
* * * *
“Brassey” : Writing of Rufus Stewart, an
English expert ventures the opinion that, on
his form in Australia, the S. Aus. pro., who is
the Commonwealth’s open champion, would
be a dangerous opponent for any golfer
breathing, Bobby Jones alone excepted. “If
he is as good a professional as Len Nettle-
fold is an amateur, lie’ll do” is the final con-
clusion. It may he merely complimentary,
but it shows that players from this end of the
earth are welcome at the other end. It re-
mains for Australian golfers to reciprocate
the good feeling by helping a party to go over
for the great British tournament.
* * * *
“The Mcllaggis” : For the information of
the 11011-elect, let me summarise the Royal
and Ancient’s ruling on the amateur status
(B. 5/l/'2B), as recently promulgated. An
amateur golfer is one who, after attaining
the age of 16 years, has not carried a club
for hire; has not received any consideration,
direct or indirect, for playing or teaching the
game or for playing a match or tournament;
has not, because of his skill as a golfer, re-
ceived a salary or remuneration, direct or
indirect, from any firm dealing in goods asso-
ciated with the game, and has not played for
a money prize in any competition. Further
the acceptance of golf- clubs, balls or “golf
merchandise” —which would seem to include
plus-fours and cubist sweaters —renders a
player ineligible to compete in the amateur
championship. The British
championship, of course the
standards are not so exacting-
in other- countries.
* * *
“Crowball” : The Queensland
custom which obliges club mem-
bers to save labor and other
expenses by personally helping
with the laying-out and improve-
ment of their courses continues
to flourish to the benefit of
everyone and everything con-
cerned. Members get a change
of exercise, and find that the
swinging of a pick improves the
wooden shots, while spade work
in a bunker is fine training for artistry
with the niblick. The Indooroopilly club,
which recently extended its course from nine
to 18 holes, now insists on members working
from 9 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. at the week-end bee.
The present job is planting couch grass on
the new fairwmys, and the bending necessary
is already showing its benefits in the reduced
waist-measurement of the older members.
* * * *
“The Mcllaggis”: The eternal argument
as to the comparative merits of the old and
the new has extended to golf. British and
American writers of all ages and degrees pf
untruthfulness have been comparing the
deeds of “Young” Tom Morris, Harry Var-
don (still with us) and Bobby Jones. Morris
was 17 when he won his first open champion-
ship in 1868; the rubber-core ball, with
highly specialised clubs and billiard-table
greens, had not then entered into the scheme
of things. With the old gutty ball he went
round at St. Andrews in 77, a record which
stood till 1900, when J. H. Taylor, with a
rubber-core, cut it down to 75. Morris won
four open championships, three of them run-
ning, and was in a class of his own during
his gareer, which was ended by death when
he was only 24. Vardon was indisputably
the greatest player in the world during the
decade from 1896 to 1906. He won the
British open on six occasions, three times
with the gutty and three times with the rub-
ber-core ball. He had a picturesque person-
ality, and his unconventional methods
shocked the golf purists of his time, but his
famous overlapping grip is now almost uni-
versally used. Jones has won the American
and British open championships twice. For
deadly accuracy under all conditions he has
not been surpassed by any of the older men,
but it has been said of him that his golf
is rather the product of the machine than of
genius.
* * * *
“Jobber”: Night golf (B. 15/12/’27) is no
novelty at Leura (N.S.W.). When the
moon is at the full in a cloudless sky, the
heads often go round, a hurricane lamp being
used on the tee but nowhere else. Bogey was
36 in my time, and on several occasions
the Colonel has been squared by moonlight.

“Trevdee”: The sport who is gloomily
suspicious when his fancy comes a cropper
is not peculiar to horse-racing. I was at the
Melbourne Motordrome the night cyclists
Opperman and Marronier had their great
tussle over 15 miles with motor pacing—the
most thrilling affair of the kind I have seen.
With a few laps to go Opperman had set up
a lead of 50 yards, when the machine of his
pacemaker (Bob Finlay) suddenly toppled
over at 55 m.p.h. While the ambulances were
rushing across the gentleman on my right
volunteered his opinion. “A man’s a mug
ter come ’ere,” lie growled. “Ennybody cud
see ’e did that on purpose ter let the Froggy
win, so’s t' ’ave another race nex’ week!”
* * * *
“Buzz”: What’s wrong with the fun at
the Brisbane Speedway (B. 5/l/’2B) ? At
last week’s show there were thrills in plenty.
As one paper says, the night was brimming
over with sensations, and the safety-fence
did wonderful work in protecting “not only
the riders but the public”—the blinkin’
public, mind you ! For example: “But for
the elastic wire cushion, Pritchard, who was
thrown against the fence by a runaway
machine, would probably be nursing broken
limbs instead of a few bruises, while the
spectators who were seated in the vicinity
of the spot where Worden’s machine struck
the fence were completely protected by the
springy fence, which stopped the runaway
machine and threw it back on the track.”
There mayn’t be as much swank about the
arrangements up here in Brisbane as there
is in Sydney and Melbourne, but we give
the public its money’s worth, even if we
have to keep the jiggers off it with spring
mattresses.
* * * *
“Bump” : A motor road-race which ought
to be popular with the dental fraternity,
since it is calculated to shake the molars out
of a hippopotamus, is the annual six-hours’
event over the pave roads round Lille, in
France —the Diggers’ old friend “Lil.”
“Pave” is the French name for the road-
paving of round cobblestones about the size
and appearance of petrified coconuts with
which members of the A.I.F. made a long
and blasphemous acquaintance in the past.
The latest (went was contested by 29 cars
and was won by one Rost, driving a 2000 c.c.
Georges Irat, 306.8 miles having been
covered in the time. An Aries, driven by
Laly, won in the 3000 c.c. class with 290
miles, while Dore, in a 1500 c.c. La Licorns,
covered 304 miles; he was awarded the for-
mula prize, the Franchomme Cup. How
many loose nuts and similar gadgets were
picked up after the race is not stated. There
were no Fords in the field.
•-1: * * *
“Trembler”: The motor-racing champion-
ship of the world is settled by the results
of the several Grand Prix races annually
held in Europe and the one at Indianapolis,
TI.S.A. Robert Benoist, who drives for
the Delage proprietary, won all the European
events in 1927; he did not compete in the
American contest. Benoist began with the
French Grand Prix in July, covering 373
miles at Montlilery in 4hr. 45min. 41 l-ssec
(77.24 m.p.h.) ; then he won the Spanish
Grand Prix, 430 miles, in 51ir. 20min. 45see.
(80.5 m.p.h.). Next came his success in the
Monza event in Italy, 315 miles, at 90 m.p.h.;
and he finally carried off the British event
at Brooklands, 325 miles, in 3hr. 49min.
14 3-ssec. (85.59 m.p.h.). Certainly a won-
derful year for the Frenchman and his make
of car.
'Ai * * *
“Bouragi” : The Olympic cycling tests car-
ried out in Sydney in conjunction with the
Australian amateur championships revealed
,T. Standen as the outstanding track rider,
with D. Gray, also a N.S.W. man, a good
second. Their names have been forwarded to
the Olympic selection committee. Standen
won two of the Olympic trials; the third
test, over 100 kilometres, had to be aban-
doned because of rain when half finished.
In addition, he finished first in the half-mile,
one-mile, five- and ten-miles championships of
Australia, though he was disqualified for
“wobbling” in the mile, and the race given to
Gray. The meeting was run in very so-so
fashion, and there were “regrettable inci-
dents,” such as the stoushing of one rider
by another. But there is something radically
wrong with the direction of amateur cycling,
as the refusal of the central body to endorse
the candidature of R. W. Lamb for a place
in the Olympic team shows. Lamb won the
Olympic test race last November on awful
N.S.W. country roads, and finished so far
ahead that he loafed home the last 10 miles.
His time was 6hr. Bmin. 14sec. Blanclion-
net, who won at Paris in 1924, took 6hr.
20min. 4Ssec. to cover the same distance
(188 kilometres) on the perfect French
roads. Yet we are now told that Lamb is
“not good enough.”
Miscellaneous
There was rejoicing in Gaul last week
when the South-West of France beat the
Waratahs by 19 to 10 at Toulouse. The
Frenchmen led 11-5 at half-time; their back
play is described as about the best encoun-
tered on the tour. This is the first time a
Dominion team has been defeated in France,
if one excepts the Maoris.
* * , * *
“Amateur Pro.”: As was expected, the
English Rugby League tried to purchase the
services of some of the Waratahs at the con-
clusion. of their British tour. Greatorex,
who is a member of Sydney Telegraph
staff, was offered £5OO down and a job on a
North Country sporting paper. Fifteen hun-
dred and a “big” salary was the bid for
Jack Ford, considered the best forward seen
over that way for many a year. And Breck-
enridge, whose breakaway play has won him
thousands of admirers, was tempted with
£lOOO and a “good” salary. But the three
young players and others who were ap-
proached declined the proposals without
thanks, remembering, doubtless, that most of
the one-time Australian and Maoriland Rugby
stars who left home to follow the lure of
professional football in the Lancashire and
Yorkshire clubs have lived to regret it. The
English scouts were equally unlucky with
the last All Blacks. The only player who
lent an ear to their blandishments was full-
back Nepia. a Maori of the naivest type.
Asked at last to name his own price, Nepia
said it was £20,000. The Englishmen are
wondering yet if the young man was in
earnest or pulling their legs. A lot of
Maorilanders have no doubt at all about it.
:j> * J|s *
“Six Beat”: Westralia’s “Brusher” Jones
distinguished himself in the swimming sec-
tion of the Australian Games at Manly
baths. He won both his races, the 400 and
200 metres, cutting out the 200 metres, when
a strong gale had made the water most diffi-
cult, in the good time of 2min. 35 2-ssec.
The 16-year-old Manly boy Noel Ryan was
second to .Tones in the 400 metres, and in
the 1500 metres he beat Moss Christie by
30 yards, in 22min. 30sec. —very good time
considering the conditions. Edna Davey and
Bonnie Mealing did best among the girls;
Edna won the 400 and 100 metres.
* * * *
“Splash”: Not since Hinemoa did her
famous swim in the Maoriland lake have such
paeans of joy gone up from the sensational
press as when “little Betty Taw,” aged 13,
swam second in the Olympic 400 metres race
at Manly baths to Edna Davey, who beat
the Infant Phenomenon by 8 yards in 6min.
13sec. It is a pity to see followers of athletic
sport so lost to all sense of proportion as to
encourage the robbing of kindergartens to
make an Olympic holiday. Apart from the
truly ridiculous aspect of the situation—does
anyone seriously consider the sending of this
babe to compete at Amsterdam?—there are
obvious dangers in pitting a half-grown child
against splendid specimens of womanhood m
such a stiff trial as the 400 metres. Swim-
ming over a distance with the pace on is a
L.C. PARKER, the Queensland sprinter,
who has nominated for a professional
handicap in Melbourne.
most exhausting form of athletics. Poor
little Betty is only one of several infants
who are being sooled on to attempt feats
hazardous to their health and strength. If
the swimming authorities won’t interfere
higher authority should.

“Spike” : The ranks of amateur athletics
got a mild shock when L. C. Parker, win-
ner of the Australasian 100-yards champion-
ship in 1926, and holder of the Australasian
record for the distance (9 4-ssec.), decided
to turn professional. The Queenslander has
evidently been attracted by the big money
prizes offered for the Melbourne Thousand
and the alleged world’s sprint championship
at Melbourne Motordrome. The Thousand
is to be a Sheffield Handicap, and £5OO goes
to the winner. Parker has been handicapped
at 14 yards, Tim Banner being on scratch.

“Backwoodsman”: James Wall, one of the
grand old men of N.S.W. bowls, has been
chosen by the Australian Bowling Council
to confer with the International Bowling
Council in London in regard to a regular
interchange of visits between Australian
and British teams and the securing of
uniform rules: he will leave for England
in March. For years Jim Wall has been a
leading official in N.S.W. bowling. He
was vice-president of the association and
GUY WILLIAMS, of Barraba, who has been
playing excellent tennis at Rushcutter
Bay, though beaten in the contest for
the N.S.W. country championship,
which he held last year.
succeeded John Spence as president; now
he is v.-p. again, John Scott, of the North
Sydney club, being president. Like many
N.S.W. bowlers, the ambassador to Britain
is a builder when not seriously occupied on
the green.
“Bumpkin” : Much misplaced ingenuity is
being expended in Victoria in getting round
the Act forbidding betting on tin-hares.
One proposal was to substitute a stuffed
bunny for the mechanical animal, but this
was dropped when it was pointed out that
there would still be a “quarry” within the
meaning of the Act. Thereupon it was
thought to eliminate the “mechanical”
element by attaching the stuffed object to
the tail-end of a pony. But the brightest
discovery made to date is that the dogs
don’t need a quarry at all. After a few
nights of chasing the mechanical beast with
its buzzing and clattering accompaniment,
they will pursue the noise alone. Anybody
who has watched whippet-racing could have
told the deep thinkers this at the jump.
* * * *
“ ’Gabba” : “Lievre” was speaking out of
his turn when he said (B. 12/l/’2B) that
the tin-hare had been chased off the Brisbane
Cricket Ground. There has been a recon-
struction of the old co. under the auspices of
one of the Sydney concerns, and “a grand
re-opening” is to be staged. “A feature of
the new administration,” according to an
esteemed newspaper, “and one which must
appeal to all,” is free admission of school
children during the vacation period. The
little pets will have to get a pass, but these
are obtainable at several places in Brisbane,
besides the office of the new co. It used
to be an axiom in regard to horses that
the younger you broke ’em the worse they
were when they were wanted for solid work.
I can’t shake off the feeling that the useful
old adage applies with even greater force
in this particular instance.
# * * ’.I:
“Shell”: For some years past people
interested in professional sculling have
been trying to form a Board of Control
to take over the conduct of world’s cham-
pionship matches. Such a board might do
much to rehabilitate the sport by putting
an end to the hole-and-corner manner in
which contests have been arranged, and sub-
stituting definite rules for conditions which
change with the moods of the champion or
his backers. An attempt of the kind was
originated in Sydney a couple of years ago,
but nothing came of it. The new proposal
comes from London, and it is suggested that
Steve Fairbairn, the famous Victorian-
Cambridge University oarsman and coach,
should be the Australian representative.

woods. The co.’s policy is to buy suit-

able varieties and apply an afforestation

“Chevroford”: The time-payment system
has been an amazing fertiliser to the motor
industry in Vic. In the past 11 years
drivers’ licenses have increased from 15,594
to 143,453, and registrations of cars from
7654 to 96,182. The revenue from fees in
1915 was £32,209. Last year it was £716,359.
Next year it is expected to touch the million.
Motorists who use the roads, in some of the
urban areas especially, wonder where all the
money goes.
* * * *
“Hermes” : During the Christmas rush at
Sydney G.P.0., which started with the
arrival of a big English mail on Decem-
ber 18, many men worked for eight
days in succession with little time off except
for sleeping. For five days the hours were
from 9 to 6; on three days they came on
duty at 8 and knocked off at 10. I often try
to imagine the sort of shock the public would
get and what proportion of Christmas pre-
sents would go undelivered were the postal
expert sorters ever to hold stop-work meet-
ings or go out on strike. As it is, most of
them appreciate the opportunity of earning
good overtime pay.
* . * * *
“Max” : Crystallised fruit might doubtless
be made in Australia (B. 22/12/’27), but
there is little or no demand for it in a
country where consumers have an abund-
ance of fresh fruit all the year round. This
form of sweetmeat is popular in cold north-
ern climes, especially at Christmas time, but
it has no such appeal here. The process of
crystallising is very simple, and the cost of
the plant is small. Time and patience are
required, and a knack for attractive boxing
and packing, but the accessible market is
so small that many who have enquired into
it have found the prospective returns dis-
couraging. A reliable work on the subject
is “The Art of Canning and Preserving as
an Industry,” by Dr. Jean Pacrette; the
French have always excelled at this work.
* * * *
“Logwood”: English papers complain
that the poorer quarters of London are
being flooded with a cheap red “wine” cost-
ing about 2d. a glass, and carrying a kick
that would shake the nerve of a land sales-
man. The stuff seems to be alarmingly like
Australia’s old friend “Pinkie,” which has
'helped to fill many a reception house in this
country, but it is more probably some of the
crude Spanish product that was being im-
ported to England as “port” before the
British duties were raised. If it does come
from Australia, the people who are handling
it, as well as those on this side who have
permitted its export, should be compelled to
drink a two-gallon jar of it apiece. The
export of crude, low-grade wines from this
country once set the industry back for a
generation, and it would be calamitous if
the sorry story was repeated, now that the
trade is going so well in Britain.
* * * *
“Yolk”: Senator Guthrie, who specialises
in wool as well as the fillums, gave a Vic-
torian audience some interesting reminders
the other day that all the big wool prices
don’t belong to modern days. In a lecture
to the Victorian Historical Society lie dug
up the fact that John Macarthur, the first
merino-fancier in Australia, got 16s. 4d. a
lb. for a single bale, though the weight was
not mentioned. Later he realised up to 10s.
6d. a lb. for a consignment of 26 lots, a fair-
sized shipment, as things went then. The
nearest moderns have got to that is the
9s. Id. per lb. paid for Western Victorian
greasy in 1920; the same year a scoured
consignment from the same district brought
11s. 4d. in London.
* * # *
“Uramao”: Some forestry companies of
Maoriland came in for some pungent criti-
cism at the Dunedin Stock Exchange annual
meeting the other day. “The Government
must know that something in the nature of
a swindle is being worked, but neither it
nor the papers will assist us,” said one
prominent member. It was further alleged
that two millions of money have been raised
by the companies and that it is very diffi-
cult to get any information about its expen-
diture. One company manager retorted that
the trouble was that the two millions had been
raised without the Stock Exchange members
getting a “cut” by way of brokerage. He
added that 50 per cent, more bonds were
taken up in Australia than in Maoriland. Per-
haps the influx of Australian money into the
Dominion causes the Government to put the
telescope to its blind eye and the extensive
advertising in the newspapers makes them
disinclined to be critical.

AWOMAN'S
LETTER
This year the Tirranna meeting was more
picnicky than its habit had been of late.
The horses, too, were more in the picnic
class. The historic meeting has seen the
dCbut of gallopers that have subsequently
secured some of the highest honors of the
racing world. But there were no potential
Melbourne Cup winners at the 75th anni-
versary of the social event founded by the
Gibson family, and consequently thefe were
none of those “Where are the rest of ’ern? ’
finishes. The racing on both days was far
more interesting than it was last year, and
a much larger crowd witnessed it. Mr.
Campbell Gibson, grandson of the founder,
was absent on account of illness in the
family, but most of the old district identities
were present. There was great entertain-
ment of visitors from all parts of the Com-
monwealth, and the fusillade of popping corks
inside the gum-leaf gunyahs indicated that
the district folk were doing it in the spirit
that prompted the first gathering of the
clans in 1855.
A popular event was the victory that fell
to the colors of Dr. N. W. Kater, worn by
Jack Melville. These colors were last flown
at Tirranna 35 years ago by A. E. Cordeaux,
the present handicapper. The ladies were
very successful. The coveted Bachelor’s Bag
event was won by Rosemary Osborne’s Two
Diamonds, so there is still a chance for some
lucky bachelor to pluck victory from defeat
by winning both prize and prizetaker. The
same nag ran a good third in the Cup. Mrs.
C. W. H. Binney collected most of the
coveted ironmongery won by the lady owners
with her black beauty Daayah, who took
two firsts and a second. Helen Blomfield,
of Moss Vale, helped to create a record for
the course with The Mace, which dead-heated
with Stan O’Keefe’s handsome mare Snaffle,
and in the run-off again managed to push
his nose level with the mare at the finish.
Mr. O’Keefe, who hails from Narrandera
and was making his first appearance at Tir-
ranna, was very proud of the fact that he
bred and trained both the mare and her
rider.
Rain threatened early on the second day,
and during the luncheon hour a smart shower
fell; whereupon gallant men climbed on to
the roofs of leafy gunyahs wfith car covers
and spread them, amid earnest requests not
to drop through on to the refreshments. At
the conclusion of the programme the prizes
were handed over by Mrs. Lucian Faithfull
and the recipients as usual turned deaf ears
to persistent demands for speech. Some day
an embittered humorist may be goaded into
slaying this craving for oratory by making a
speech that will leave his tormentors no time
to dress for the ball.
The usual flock of Sydney’s bright wings
fluttered up to the gathering, and for many
of these the local gentry provided house
room. From Moss Vale, from Cooma, from
Canberra and even from Melbourne the
visitors swarmed, and the drowsy old course
waked to life, vivid and polychrome. Mrs.
Lucian Faithfull, wife of the popular presi-
dent, was smart in navy blue marocains
studded with steel nailheads. Jean Ander-
son and Cecile Belbridge were two who
attracted the eye, the first in misty blues,
the second in beige pinks shaded by a wide
hat of black crin. and lace. Mrs. Geoff
Faithfull, in smart grass-green worn with a
white felt hat, was another of clothes
interest; and the same coloring was favored
by Mrs. Bill Litchfield. The W. D. Gordons,
of Manar, were well represented, and so
were the Osbornes. Ryries and Blomfields,
Mackellars and Allens occurred at irregular
intervals; Cripps Clark seniors were in com-
pany with Cripps Clark juniors; and W.
N. Gunn, the club’s secretary for 35 years,
again proved himself a hardy annual.
For the ball which finishes off each day’s
sport, the Show-ground Pavilion had been
turned, for some inscrutable reason, into an
Italian Court. The most discussed effect
was obtained by a scene that took in the
whole of the Grand Canal and most of the
Doges’ marble palaces—a low stone wall at
the foot of the painting was presumably a
mooring place for gondolas, as it couldn’t
have been a parking place for cars. Guard-
ing the supper were two great leather steel-
bossed doors of the Middle Ages. Evidently
the gentry then, as now, knew the necessity
of shielding the chicken what-nots from the
infuriated onrush of their guests. Great
Bangalow palms and hanging baskets, of gold
and crimson roses helped in creating the
Venetian atmosphere, and the southern end of
the supper-room melted suddenly aw 7 ay to the
hills behind Fiesole, or Dolce far Niente,
this Letter forgets which.
George Lambert has carried off the Archi-
bald prize, this year worth a comfortable
£560, for his portrait of Mrs. Murdoch, of
Melbourne, mother of Keith, the young
Northcl,iffe of the Herald publications. In
this portrait, the head and shoulders of an
elderly lady, Lambert has done some of his
finest work. There is a look of something
prisoned behind the sympathetic eyes—some-
thing that makes the thoughtful onlooker
wonder if speech, after all, can lift man or
woman out of the dumb creation. How' can
one human being reveal itself to another —
words are such dull coin into which to
transmute the quicksilver of emotion, the
fairy gold of imaginings! The same feeling
of the Great Unexpressed has been caught
by Melbourne artist Buckmaster in his
“Portrait of My Mother.” There is a com-
pelling force about this picture, a clever
handling of flesh tones that draws the gaze
over and over again. Marie Burke, as
Wildflower, very expressionless, and Irene
Vanbrugh hang side by side. In the latter
Mclnnes might be said to have done justice
untempered by mercy. Mary Edwards is
represented by a chromatic outburst in
greens and mauves of which Mrs. Dorothy
Murray is the centre. There are 56 entries
in all. Several come from Maoriland; one
of them, a picture of Knight Charles Sta-
tliam, represents him as very upstanding,
though the wig and gown seem to submerge
the good looks and charm for which the
family is famous in the Southland.
May Moore here presents the sensitive face
of Marie E. J. Pitt, one of the most poignant
and spiritual
of Australia's
poets. She
was born at
Bulu mwaai,
in Victoria’s
forest wilds,
and still counts
her red-letter
day that on
which she re-
ceived word
that a poem of
hers had been
accepted for
Th e Bulle-
tin. So fa r
only one col-
lected book of
her verse en-
riches the Aus-
tralian shelf.
This was pub-
lished in Mel-
bourne in 1925. To that city Marie really
belongs nowadays, but this Letter snared her
by stealth last week, when she made one of
her rare visits to Sydney, to shine in its
pages.
Something like a hallelujah went up from
Sydney’s presswomen the other day when
the Town Hall sent out chits for a reception
by the newly-appointed Chief Commissioner’s
lady. For the city is socially in the doldrums.
There’s not even a committee meeting to
furnish half a column for the hungry she-
scribs. So every presswoman turned up at
the Town Hall at the appointed hour. Some
arrived early to get a glimpse of the accept-
ances. When they reached the outer entrance
no string of cars filled their eyes. The cor-
ridors echoed loudly to the sound of their
own footfalls. Could there have been some
mistake in the date? But no, there on the
upper corridor glowed a ruby carpet, and
a uniformed attendant passed swiftly with
a silver salver. Yet the doors of the recep-
. tion-rooms were shut tight! the
’ Peerage and the Beerage were not arriving
till later. The alert press girl got out her
pencil and her notebook, prepared to leap
upon the first arrivals. Steps on the stairs!
Aha! A Judge’s lady maybe, dragged from
some mountain fastness. The steps mounted,
a smart hat was tilted up, a hand waved.
Another sister of the pen! (That sounds
unkindly pig-like, but really isn’t.) Came
another and another and yet another. The
doors were swung open. At an angle of
45 degrees between the mantelpiece and the
portals were grouped Mrs. Fleming, Mrs. Gar-
lick and Mrs. Layton. Mr. Horsefield hovered
between them and the doorstep. The recep-
tion was on! Mr. Horsefield murmured the
introductions, with a little playful explana-
tion that this was exclusively a party for
the Press. (How different that is from a
pressing party!) The already-arriveds swal-
lowed hard and then watched the ghastly
truth being broken to every other harried
social gossiper who entered the room filled
with the hope of a real live party to write
about. After that it was a case of the
guests dissembling their emotions, toying with
a savory or a fois gras sandwich, while they
gaped into each other’s mouths, so to speak,
saying “Curse you, at least say something
that I can steal!”
Mrs. Fleming and Mrs. Garlick left all
the talking to their lords who, together with
Mr. Morton, arrived after the clock struck
four. Mr. Fleming and Mr. Morton have
thick thatches of iron-grey hair, but Mr.
Garlick’s shingle is a little threadbare.
Morton is a big chap—great in shoulders and
girth—a man after Chesterton's heart. He
rumbles when he talks. Mr. Fleming is a
quick, nervous talker, a great lover of his
home. And a very fair man. He is not
depriving the Town Hall staff of its morning
and afternoon tea.
As for the rumor that the girls on the
civic pay-roll had to produce their birth
certificates, there’s no idea of having the
staff’s horoscopes cast. But there’s to be a
retiring age of 65, and it’s to be a case of
down-tools the second the 65tli year is accom-
plished. But as no woman yet born would
want to totter up and down the Town Hall
steps till the age of 65, the Civic Commis-
sioners have gallantly consented to take the
girls’ word for the number of summers they
have seen.
In Sydney there’s a curious fashion of
regarding presswomcn as a race apart. Per-
haps it is an unconscious following of Miss
Preston Stanley’s advice about segregating the
feeble-minded. When a new restaurant opens,
the women of the newspapers are bidden,
not as ordinary guests, though the publicity
they give the affair would be worth pounds
in advertising space alone, but to be clumped
all together at one table. The same process
is gone through at charity dances, which only
for the efforts of the presswomen would often
draw a blank. Then after a specially success-
ful charity function a generous committee
woman feels she owes a courtesy to the
various press-writers. What does she do?
Immediately issues cards for a party where
again the poor scribes are herded together
without a leavening of any members of any
other section of society. It is like being of a
race apart—like the poor Jews who of old were
locked in the Ghetto and not allowed to mix
with their fellow citizens. Well, when this
pengirl has enough of her earnings invested
in Government bonds to buy a house at Dar-
ling Point, she’ll have separate parties for
her butcher friends, for the “descendants of
convicts,” for the wives of rag merchants, for
the wives of Sussex-street. The crafts will be
as severely segregated by her as the whole
community seems bent now on segregating
her and her fellows.
From the aristocrats, including a smoky-
grey phantom Rolls-Royce and a maroon Sun-
beam, proud in red morocco upholstery and red
lacquer, the cars at the Motor Show range
down through the classes to the masses. Pack-
ards, Vauxhalls, Chryslers, Dodges, “Studies”
and Hudsons, each as gleaming as some
chariot of the sun, glow amicably at one
another in.two big pavilions ; and the proudest
of them are not too proud to have their points
extolled for the benefit of the visiting thou-
sands, many of whom will never approach
closer to the ownership of a car than buying
a tin of Duco finish to freshen up a time-
worn chair. From the £2900 Rolls, which
is the unquestioned Queen of the Show, the
note in upholstery and decorations is one of
restraint. Mouse-grey, the grey-green of moss
and the red that is known as dregs-of-wine
are the colorings most in favor, though occa-
sionally a bright buff or cream caters for
the exuberant fancy. There was a time
when the interiors threatened to be boudoir-
like ; the threat has passed, and a car re-
mains a car, something to eat up the miles
between resting-place and resting-place.
Nor are horny hands ignored in this dis-
play. Motor-trucks and delivery-waggons in
buff and red and mustard-yellows meet the
gaze—lovely things with red wheels for the
greengrocer (but not at all green where
prices are concerned) to carry the water-
cress and the salad greens to your suburban
gate. In little carpeted recesses between
one make of car and another, gentlemen
suave and honeyed of tongue, and upholstered
to match the company they keep, sit at
polished tables, just waiting to take your
order for a cool thousand pounds’ worth. Nor
is their faith in mankind unjustified. Many
walk unresisting as the fly of old into the
web; but this is a web woven of long,
stretching roads and green paddocks, of sunny
days and shining sea-washed sands.
Many who long for the web, but have
to enter it by strategy, as it were, walk over
to the harbor where the used cars ride at
anchorage. Here, looking an invitation to go
gypsying, is an outstanding jolly caravan
cruiser fitted up for four travellers. Its floor
is oilclothed. It boasts ice-chest, cupboards,
wash-basins and even a water-tank. And,
of course, there are cars whose seats can be
miraculously stretched into beds. And by
night films in which motor-cars take the
place of the sheik and the heroine of the con-
ventional fillum.
Last week Mrs. Muscio, the new president
of the National Council of Women, received
the accolade from the Country Women’s
Association which is affiliated with the N.C.
The initiation was a tea party in the heights
of Pitt, Son and Badgery’s offices. Other
guests were Mrs. Coleman, of Norfolk
(Eng.), and Miss Weeks (Honolulu), who
spoke on the aim of the Pacific Conference
that is dated for next year. The gathering
was alert and bright in the way a fox-
terrier is alert and bright, rather than in
the way of the Persian kitten’s gambols.
Surf sirens were interested in wedding
veils at least one day last week, when well-
known swimming girl Vera Viner, of Manly,
took a leading part at the Mary Immaculate
Church. The usual sheen of silk and shim-
mer of silver lace wrapped this bride, whose
proudest accessory was a hand-made lace veil
of great fineness; and in her train stepped
one fully-grown bridesmaid and two train-
bearers in melting pinks and blues. After
Vera had murmured the promises that made
her Mrs. Edward Livingstone, her mother
and father refreshed the principals and
guests at the Hotel Manly. The bride last
year was the Village’s favorite choice for the
Sun’s surf-queen competition.
Here is possibly the only Maorilander in
the group of girls chosen by Hislop and
Dame Nellie to sing with the coming Wil-
liamson Grand
Opera Com-
pany. The girl
with the pretty
golden - brown
hair is Mary
Mac Cormack,
whose luscious
notes con-
stantly charm
list eners-in,
and who is
known in the
flesh to the
audiences o f
every musical
society’s con-
certs in Syd-
ney. Mary
has studied
singing for
over five years
at the Conser-
vatorium, and,
though anxious
to spend last Christmas with her family in
Auckland (she’s a daughter of the Judge
Mac Cormack house), something impelled her
to remain in Sydney. If she had gone there’d
have been no test before Dame Nellie, and
therefore no grand-opera job.
In the cool of the evening, after a fervid
January day, Myra Wilson came from Bondi
to St. Andrew’s on matrimony intent.
Brother Reginald escorted her in her froth
of white georgette and lace as soft as the
edge of the surf breaking on Bondi’s beach,
and found a waiting groom —W. H. Mc-
Keown, of Neutral Bay. Bride’s sisters
Olive and Valerie ’maided in georgettes that
were a rhythm of blue and gold. Later on
Mrs. Wilson hostessed at the Australia in
filmy black.
The Mary Immaculate Church at Waver-
ley is proving a popular smithy for the
welding of the (more or less) unbreakable
link. A recent bride was Freda Pryke, once
of Goulburn, who presented herself at its
altar in a flutter of ivory georgette and
Chantilly lace with intent to marry James
Ready, of Ashfield. The knot was sur-
rounded by the ritual of a Nuptial Mass,
and a notable feature of the bride’s outfit
was an ivory-bound prayer-book sent to her
by her old teachers, the Sisters of Mercy at
Goulburn.
If there’s anything in a name, even
though it does lack one crooked s, then the
world-famed Wedding March should have
pealed and surged with a special glory about
the steps of Dr. Harry Mendelsohn and his
bride as they passed from the Great Syna-
gogue last week. The bride, Edith Abbott,
was glitteringly enwrapped in -liamente,
pearls and silver on a background of white
chiffon. The two ’maids and the two small
flower-girls sparkled in white and gold, and
gold sequins were thickly sown over the
black georgettes in which the bride’s mother
received at the Ambassadors.
Scintillating in bridal raimant that em-
bodied ivory satin heavy with rhinestones
and a silver tissue train lined with pale
pink chiffon, Leila Bridge, a Rose Bay bud,
married Colin Baker, of Gunnedah, one
night last week. The wedding was staged
at St. Philip’s, and A. W. Bridge armed his
daughter up the aisle, while the groom s
sister Clarice followed the trail of the
bride’s pink orchids in coral-pink sprayed
with silver. The Wentworth was the centre
of congratulations ; there the bride’s mother
did the honors, her handsome black and gold
frocking enriched by a cloak of gold lame.
A honeymoon in Maoriland is the luck of

Have you ever watched those dashing
speed-boats churn up the blue crystal of
Port Jackson without longing for yours to
be the hand that spun the wheel? Well, fair
woman showed that the water speedway held
no more terror for woman than for man last
Saturday when nine girls handled nine of the
swiftest craft of the Royal Motor Yacht Club
in a hell-for-leather race with its base in
Rose Bay. Miss Weymouth was the first
to bring her champing charge home. Of
the group the youngest was Joyce Barker,
a ’teen-old fledgling.

Chatter
The unheralded and unexpected three
days’ polo at Moonee Valley last week was
accompanied by a heat-wave that limited
interest in the play to relatives and friends
of the contestants for the Somers Junior
Cup. The State Governor captained a team
of competitors for his own trophy; the other
wearers of his colors, green, white and
black, being Colonel Davidson, Major Nimmo
and Major Drake-Brockman. The opening
matches were played with the thermometer
bubbling up to 104 in the shade, and there
wasn’t any shade for the players. A gallery
of motor-car spectators waited at the outside
line with cold liquids and sliced oranges to
buck up the combatants between each chukka.
The more experienced riders emptied a quart
or two of cold water over the base of their
skulls during these intervals. The ponies
seemed to feel the heat, and when relieved of
their burdens panted pathetically. Fair
watchers wore smoked glasses and did their
best to beat off a plague of sticky flies.
Among the onlookers was Lady Somers, cool-
looking in cream skirt with green-and-white-
striped jumper, tapped by a green hat. Lady
Caroline Agar was with her. The v.-r. team,
though beaten, was well led by his Ex., who
scored all the goals. In the excitement of
the play the great Australian, adjective was
freely used and there were a good many
“damns”; but the powdered sex is as well
used to such naughty words nowadays as it
was in the times of good Queen Bess. Lord
Stonehaven was there on the second day,
when the attendance included Mrs. Davidson,
in fawn and a navy-blue spotted silk, with
a black hat; Mrs. Nimmo, in gown and
millinery of roseate and ivory tones; Mrs.
Archibald Currie, the T. C. Manifolds, Mrs.
Beau Fairbairn, Alister Clark, several
Winter Irvings, Mrs. H. Creswick, and other
well-known sports from Camperdown, Seven
Creeks, the liiverina and Caramut.
There was cooler weather for the final
day’s play when the Moonee Valley team
won the Cup and the Caramut quartette the
consolation prizes before the eyes of a goodly
crowd of onlookers. Lady Somers, in blue
jumper suit and stitched silk hat, laurelled
the victors. She was accompanied by his
Ex., the Davidsons and Lady Caroline Agar,
the lastnamed in a biscuit shade frock en-
livened with touches of flame hue. The
Governor-General had Bishop Crick of
Ballarat as a companion. Irene Vanbrugh
with a wine-colored hat topping black and
white figured ninon, and her niece, Prudence
Vanbrugh, whose musliroom-pink apparel
was allied to a fawn-colored hat, were in
evidence. Most women aimed at the cool
and comfortable in attire, and there was a
great display of Ballibuntal and Bangkok
millinery. The owners of broad acres were
represented by the F airbairns, Staugh-
tons, Manifolds, Winter Irvings and Army-
tages; and Mrs. Geoffrey Gibbs, Mrs. Eric
Harrison, Mrs. Alister Clark and lots of
daintily-clad maidens were in the throng.
St. Hilda’s seafront on the worst night
of our hot spell was an extraordinary sight,
beach and sea being packed with scantily-
clad humanity of both sexes and all ages.
Private cars, taxis and ’buses came to the
beach in shoals, and the trams made new
records for over-crowding. When Melbourne
has a heat-wave St. Hilda gets very near
to nature in the matter of attire, and bath-
ing-suits were to be seen even on thorough-
fares remote from the sea-front.
Croquet isn’t the most reckless pastime
known to the world of sport, but it has its
moments. The close finish of the third inter-
national match on Saturday afternoon for
the Macßobertson Shield caused a flutter of
excitement and a rush of spectators to the
Melbourne club’s ground. The battle be-
tween the English and the Australian teams
resulted in the latter winning the laurels by
one game, and Sir Francis Wemyss, captain
of the English team, passed over the shield
to C. J. Miller, who skippered the victors.
The English croquet team, having survived
our heat wave, sat down to a farewell dinner
at Menzies’ on Saturday night on the eve
of their trek to Sydney and Maoriland. The
visiting players made many friends in this
city. Mrs. Du Pre, whose colonel was one
of the contestants, got into touch with the
leaders of feminist movements, and her
daughter Betty was shown around by some
of our best people. The home of the Du
Pres is at Wilton Park, Buckinghamshire.
Miss Stell, -whose hobby outside croquet is
bell-ringing, was invited one Sunday to help
summon the congregation to St. Paul’s
Cathedral, and handled her rope like a pro-
fessional.
The guests bidden by the Fred W. Dennetts
to their pretty home at Brighton listened to
a programme of music on two pianos, a
medium for which, though few pianists are
aware of it, there is quite an extensive
literature. The hostess, Elsie Buck that
was, clothed her sylph-like figure in floral
georgette which toned with the decorations.
Paddy Ewan brought a nice sister. Peggy
Ward was attired like a red, red rose, and
her husband, Ronald Ward, was one of the
evening’s music makers. Margery Playfair
framed her dainty form in a frilly cloud of
silky muslin.
There was a fire in the portion of the
Treasury Gardens known as the Japanese
Garden • the other day. (Certainly it is a
very pretty section, but whether it is true
to name is another matter.) Fortunately
the damage done by the ignition of a cane
plant was insignificant. When the Japanese
training warships were here some time ago
two of the officers were being shown the
spot. One of the pair asked with a charm-
ing smile, “But why do you call it a
Japanese garden?” A ready-witted depart-
mental head assisting to do the honors re-
plied, “As a compliment to visitors from
your distinguished country.” The officer,
recognising that he had been well-countered,
bowed profoundly and said that he was
“touched beyond expression,” which was pro-
bably the literal truth.
Helen Rennie, whose tea-room, the Mia
Mia, was for many years a favorite rendez-
vous for the smart set, has had to close the
doors of her famous Dutch kitchen and
Georgian dining-room, losses occasioned
through a change of premises that involved a
lengthy interruption of business being mainly
responsible. Mrs. Arthur Streetou lent a hand
with the designing of the tea-resort, and
everyone who knew the place regrets the
failure of the venture. Helen Rennie and
her sister Gertrude have been moving spirits
in many feminine, activities in this city, and
the well-appointed Quamby Club owes them
a lot of its success. Gertrude Rennie, who
for a time was a social writer in Sydney
and Melbourne, is now managing Ranelagh,
the golf house at Frankston.
Rita, daughter of the William J. Taylor
couple of Canterbury, and one of the
fledgling songbirds of the Albert-street Con.,
made a matrimonial pact with Harry
Uxbridge Best, son of the John T. Bests, of
this city, one night last week. The bride’s
posy of cream- and golden-hued water-lilies
blended with a dress of deep ivory lace, a
train of cream-and-gold brocade and ’a lengthy
veil of more, lace of extra-special quality.
A trio of ’maids, two of whom sported blends
of pink and the other ciel blue, were in
attendance, their millinery matching their
apparel. The Oriental housed rejoicings.

Lace frocks will be worn at all the smart
dances this coming winter. They will be
flounced and sashed with soft satin, and
probably flash a diamond buckle near the
waistline. Sprays of flowers will be worn
again, hut they are to be made of paste,
and they will be fastened below the shoulder,
instead of perched upon it. Wine, tones and
beige are the evening shades thus far favored,
following the inclinations of Paris. White
dresses with narrow jewelled belts worn
with satin shoes with one diamond strap and
accompanied by a flat envelope bag glitter-
ing with sequins or paste are among the
p.easing fashions tipped for the nights to
corr, e.
Two society recruits to Stageland who took
part in a performance of “The Ghost Train”
in a remote suburb had an adventurous
experience with a real train the other night.
At the final curtain the pair clutched their
belongings, and just caught what they fondly
believed was the city-bound 11.10. One read
and the other slept, but it seemed an extra-
ordinarily long journey and at last a peep
out of the window revealed hills instead of
chimney tops. They got out at the next
station to discover that there was no train
to town till 4 a.m. A young railway officer
took pity on them and regaled them with
tea, buns and chatter at his bachelor shanty
during the hours of waiting. Of course
he didn’t know what extremely tony angels
he was entertaining unawares.
This is Richard Linton, founder of the
Big Brother movement and M.L.A. for Boo-
roondarra, which includes Malvern and Cam-
berwell. This
week, in Syd-
ney, tennis en-
thusiasts will
witness the
play for the
Linton Cup, a
trophy he
donated to the
L.T.A. in 1922
to encourage
young players.
The competi-
tors are nomi-
nated by their
State associa-
tio n s, and
though the
com petition
has been in
existence for
only five years,
two out of
three members
of the Aus-
tralian Davis Cup teams in the period have
been Linton Cup players. Hopman and
Crawford are the latest to get into the inter-
national limelight by this means. Mr. Lin-
ton will watch the play in Sydney, and, with
his family, proposes to witness the 1928
Davis Cup matches in Paris. A Maorilander
by birth, he first handled a racquet in Bris-
bane, where he was a member of the Wan-
derers’ Club.
Richard Linton can regard with gratifica-
tion the achievement of the Big Brother
movement, of which he is the founder, in
bringing to Australia since December, 1925,
1281 lads from oversea. The lads are
scattered over three States, 642 in Victoria,
489 in N.S.W. and 100 in S. Aus. Each
boy has a Big Brother pledged to watch
over his welfare.
Leaving Rabaul to enjoy cool breezes, Mrs.
Sydney Wanliss plunged into the heart of
our hot spell. On the way here she stayed
at Albury for a chat with her sister Mrs.
Sydney Sides, of Tividale squattage; and is
now finding temporary shelter in a South
Yarra guest-house.
Here’s a true story of newly-knighted John
Longstaff that will delight the Melbourne
friends of the suave, debonair, middle-aged
artist they know. When John was very
young he was in dad’s produce store at
Shepparton during the day while he pursued
Art by night. Rivalry sprang up between
John and a youth of John’s age who served
Mammon in the local bank. A challenge
was flung down by the embryo banker and
taken up by John, who, according to weight-
for-age, looked like being the champion
heavyweight of the world. The night
arrived, and all the lads of the village
sneaked along to the paddock where the
gory encounter was to take place. The boy
from the bank was first on the scene, and he
was in full-ring costume —shoes and shorts
and all. John, looking like the young bull of
Bashan, came straight up from the store.
He looked at his rival, peeled off his coat,
and without any other preliminaries sailed
in. There was only one round. Then John,
unaided, got back into his coat, and the
other poor kid was helped into his.
Margaret McLean is planning out the
year’s art shows, many of which will be
under her management. Among the first
exhibitors will be Miss E. Syme and Ethel
Spowers, in conjunction, and Hilda Rix
Nicholas has an early place in the list.
Dr. Douglas Stewart’s wife has packed up
her much-admired chiffons and sports-suits
and taken herself and her golf-clubs to
Devonport (Tas.) for her annual holiday.
Little Winifred Morrison, who has pirouet-
ted on toes as light as thistledown at several
charitable entertainments of late, is reckoned
by Thurza Rogers to be the finest child
exponent of classical dancing she has ever
met. The talented Maorilander has advised
little Miss Morrison to work hard and make
a career for herself, and Eunice Weston,
late of the Espinosa Academy of operatic
dancing in London, who has just hung out
her brass plate here, has taken the girl in
hand.
Melbourne’s new r est hostelry, the Alex-
ander, which towers over Spencer-street
station and is to be opened at the end of
the month, is arranged on American lines.
There are bathrooms and telephones to all
bedrooms, central heating, and a posting-
shoot on every floor. Particular attention
has been paid to furnishings, which are most
artistic. An electrically-equipped kitchen is
a feature. The new pub is one of the chain
controlled by Richardson, of wholesale liquor
fame, and will be under the management of
the Bert Jones couple, from Maoriland,
lately in receipt of custom at the Windsor.
A mild flutter amongst the teacups has
been caused by the advent of Mrs. Georges,
who is voyaging round the world, calling on
relatives and friends. The visitor, a sister
of Sir George Milne, chief of the British
General Staff, has a cousin, Mrs. Reg Cross-
man, in this city, and the David Massons
are old friends. The latter, though on the
eve of leaving for the Hobart Science Con-
gress, entertained the visitor at a tea-drink-
ing in the Botanic Gardens. The Alexandra
Club is finding houseroom for Mrs. Georges
during her stay.
Encouraged by the success of a previous
venture, Gerald Hayle is engaged on the pro-
duction of a second picture, “Sanctuary,” the
scenario of which is from his own pen.
Beth Darvall, a Bananaland girl, will take
the principal role, supported by 20 local
players. The camera work will commence
shortly.
Mary Lush, whose knowledge of kinder-
garten methods has enabled her to publish
a book on the subject, returned to her post
in this city the other day after a year in
Europe. During her absence she renewed
her health and gained knowledge of much
value.
Two young Maoriland dancers who are
digging themselves into London’s favor are
Joan Beere and John Morris, now starring
at the New Princes, in Piccadilly. They
are both from Wellington, and both are the
results of the training of Joan’s aunt,
Estelle Beere. It was in this lady’s studio
in Hill-street that pretty Thurza Rogers
spent eight years of her young life. Before
going to the New Princes, Desiree and
Doret, as the two are known, staged their
act at the Devonshire. Briefly, Desiree is a
silver fish of a dancer caught in a scarlet net
by her partner, a Spanish fisherman. Later,
freed from the spell, she comes to life a
beauteous fairy-tale princess. One London
paper describes the turn as “an exquisite
scene of lacquer red and silver.”
Here are two Christmas turnstile stories.
One of our best-dressed women, attired
for a lunch party, her black velvet model
with its touches of ermine at neck and wrists
worn with a regal air, sought the rest-room
of a city store. She took off her hat, and
vims powdering her nose, when in burst a
worried-looking woman with two small
kiddies. The newcomer made a rush for the
elegant lady, and extending a threepenny
bit demanded “Three pennies, please!” The
lady in ermine turned her head; and,
instead of offering the disdainful rebuff the
onlooker expected, she said to the motherly
one: “Well, I’m just off duty, but the
afternoon attendant is over there!” Then
she placed a nine-guinea pull-on snug to her
shingle, and made for her Rolls-Royce.
The keeper of one of the city’s busiest
turnstiles was taking a spell-oh, and the
keeper of a similar establishment had wan-
dered in for a word about Christmas. Said
the visitor: “We’re going to have supper
in the dining-room, and the tree in the
drawing-room.” “Don’t call it drawing-room,
Bella,” urged No. 1; “call it the music-
room—all the best people do.”
The Harry Davidsons are arranging to
start a tour of the Orient in March accom-
panied by daughter Molly. Another daughter,
the lately-wed Mrs. Enright, has regretfully
relinquished her intention of being one of
the party, as her husband cannot get leave.
When Hislop, the Scottish tenor, was in
Sydney 200 Australian voices poured out
their melody before him, hoping to win the
preliminary “Pass, friend” that would
qualify them to be heard in the final tests
for the Firm’s grand-opera season. Out
of these 16 were marked for further
approval; and last week, on the stage of
Her Majesty’s, before a jury that included
Melba, Fritz Hart, E. J. Tait, Andrew Mac-
Cunn, George Westmacott, John I, emm one
and Claude Kingston, the 16 were taken
oyer all the musical hurdles a grand piano
and the ingenuity of Melba could suggest.
Nine survived. And then they were given
their parts. Gundry, Gilda, Mimi? Hardly!
They are to be allowed to sing in the chorus,
that being, of course, the proper place
for the home-grown singer. If they prove
very, very good they may be tried in small
parts. But if this Letter knows anything
of the temperament of Latin grand-opera
cos., then nothing longer than a line will be
sung by the Australians, or the Firm’s
theatre will be wrecked by a cause other
than the act of God.

The
Battery you cast
rely on—always
Fit a P. & R. Accumulator to your
car and you won’t find it lacking when
most you need it. The right P. &R.
will turn an engine over against the
stickiest oil or the highest compression.
The reason is simple. The P. &R.
is built to give a powerful *and healthy
rush of current to the starter. It is
built with the knowledge that when
the starter button is first depressed the
battery is delivering current through an
almost complete short-circuit.
That is why inter-cell connectors on
the P. &R. are copper-cored. And
that, in turn, is one of the reasons
why the P. & R. lasts in service.

Wedding bells have been ringing frequently
of late. At St. Mary’s, Kangaroo Point,
Barbara McLennan and Herbert Burton
were the principals. Shasta daisies formed
the setting for the bride, who matched her
pink evening frock with a tulle bandeau.
Ruth McLennan, the bride’s sister, in blue
mariette, lent support, both bride and brides-
maid favoring vanity-bags finished with
flowers in place of posies.
The same picturesque old church was
chosen for the giving in marriage of Eliza-
beth Emily Lewis, who said “I will” to
Vaughan Cole, of Suva, wearing white and
silver draperies with a mist of old Limerick
lace.
Phyllis Mary Aronsten, in white mariette
and Honiton lace, promised to love and honor
John Elwin Collins at St. Stephen’s.
A Western wedding linked pretty little
“Bobs,” daughter of the late Colonel Reade,
and Ernest Hodgson. The bride’s gown of
lace and georgette had a finish of orange-
blossom.
The Whittingham widow, accompanied by
Molly Brenan, is home again after spending
Christmas with the E. J. Watts at their
Harbor City home.
Parts of Barambah, which is owned by
that popular racing couple the Isaac Moores,
figure in the screen version of Steele Rudd’s
“Romance of Runnibede,” showing here now
at the Winter Garden with Eva Novak in
the lead. The Hollywood lady, who is still
in our midst, was the guest of honor at a
tea at Lennon’s, when pink and crimson roses
formed an attractive setting.
This is Mrs. J. H. Goldsmith, the new pre-
sident of the
Queens land
Women’s Elec-
toral League,
who will be on
her mettle at
the coming
municipal elec-
tions. Capable
and clear-
headed, the
lady has had
lengthy experi-
ence of politi-
cal matters,
and she was a
valiant War-
worker. Eliza-
beth of Bel-
gium decorated
Mrs. Goldsmith
with the
Queen’s own
particular
medal for her
efforts on behalf of destitute Belgians.
Fit as a fiddle seems pianist Mabel Zill-
man after her trip abroad. Steady work in
London, the kindly friendship of the Back-
haus pair and festivals and opera on the
European Continent filled in a happy year.
While thunder pealed the executive of the
Queensland Women’s Electoral League fare-
welled its late president Mrs. Dan Wienholt
among palms and roses at the Garden Kiosk.
League colors and electric radiance lent a
glow to the proceedings. The petite blue-
eyed lady, who is a cousin of Arnold Wien-
holt of lion-hunting fame, becomes a matron
in charge of girl migrants. A travelling
cushion, fountain-pen and diary backed up
shoals of good wishes.
The Webster warehouse went up in smoke
the other evening, though an opportune
thunderstorm aided the fire-fighters. The
erstwhile family domicile at Whinstanes, re-
cently purchased by the Roman Catholic
church, was the scene of a dance hon-
ored by Edward P.
“The Ringer” had an enthusiastic recep-
tion at His Majesty’s. Sharing the plaudits
on the opening night with Moscovitch and
Eileen Sparkes was Brisbane’s own little
Mary Macgregor, who received many vivid
and glowing blossoms as a welcome to her
home city.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
The Australian Teachers’ Federation held
its conference for the first time in Perth. His
Ex. opened the affair and welcomed the
delegates at the Perth Technical School,
and there was a civic reception in the Town
Hall, where Dr. Battye and others made
speeches. One of the outstanding delegates
was Margaret Swan, a N.S.W. delegate, who
is interested in the training of mentally-
deficient children.
Songbird Veronica Mansfield has promised
her hand, heart and vocal cords to Basil
Carson, grandson of a once-upon-a-time
Lord Mayor of London, Sir Alfred Newton,
and son of a wealthy English merchant.
Nancy Munro, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
J. Munro, formerly of this State, now of
Pulbprough, Sussex, is to marry Mr. R. A. L.
Pears in Khartoum on January 17.
Major Ken Nicholl, A.D.C., is leaving
the retinue of Sir William Campion for that
of the G.-G.
The State Children’s Department has
dropped its harsh-sounding name, and be-
comes, in accordance with the Act passed
last session, the Child Welfare League. The
youngsters under its care are to be known
in future as wards.
Nell Anketell and her brother Terry will
start house-hunting at the same time. Miss
Anketell, who returned from Fogland a few
weeks back, has engaged herself to A. J.
Stubbs, whose parents reside in Buenos
Aires. Her brother has slipped a trinket on
the finger of Jean, only daughter of Janies
Mitchell and his lady.
Pith helmets are plentiful as mushrooms
here these days, hut our men who follow the
fashions —when there are any to follow-
have already learned to cast a weather eye
to the heavens before sallying; out thus
thatched. Under a shower of rain this sort
of headgear is liable to become a mere
squelchy ball, oozing green trickles.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
Socially speaking, Adelaide is out of town.
Race meetings are the only form of enter-
tainment billed at present; certainly the only
chance for wearing pretty frocks. A large
crowd attended the second S.A.J.C. meeting,
for which the weather was fine. _ Mayoress
Bonython watched the horses in biscuit chif-
fon, tucked, with a Russian bqdice effect,
and a large wide-brimmed hat of the same
shade. Mrs. AVhitmore Carr, club’s hos-
tess, donned navy silk, appliqued in fawn
and a beige hat. Judge Napier brought his
handsome wife, who enjoys a flutter on the
tote. Mrs. F. A. Tennant, whose game little
Flashing Star just failed to score in the
Cowandilla Handicap, wore a smart shrimp-
pink triple georgette, with hat and sunshade
to match. The club, determined to make
members retain their seats in the stand
during the races, brought a megaphone into
action. Offenders, in turn, were admonished
as “the lady in blue” or “the man in a
helmet.” Failing obedience to the order, a
policeman took the name and address. As
a result the last two races were run without
a movement on the part of the crowd in the
stand.
Christmas generally brings engagements
with its mistletoe, and congratulations
are now being showered upon Beryl, the
pretty dark-eyed daughter of Mrs. Ritchie,
of Lothian, East-terrace, and Tom, the
elder son of Mr. and Mrs. C. L. Moorhouse,
of Glen Osmond.
Mrs. Sholto Bowman, who as Leslie Mur-
doch held a similar post before her marriage,
has been re-appointed to the staff of Weber,
Shorthose and Rice’s physical-culture school.
She and her husband went to Melbourne 16
months ago, where she took up the same
work, and advanced her knowledge of stage
dancing under Thurza Rogers, late of Pav-
lova’s company.
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Murray and family,
Mrs. S. J. Jacobs and Dr. P. Chappie were
among Adelaide folk who boarded the Orama
for England.
From Wallaroo come echoes of a furious
controversy over Sunday golf. The town
council’s by-laws don’t allow it and the local
club wants the ordinance altered. Deputa-
tions of golfers and counter-deputations of
parsons and local preachers have left the
council undecided.
At the end of last week over 300 Y.A.L.
boys, who have just finished a visit to W.A.,
descended upon us. They are camped at the
Jubilee Oval and seem a cheerful crowd—
as, of course, they ought to be.
Real Persian rugs don’t often find their
way this far south, but some beauties have
recently been imported by a local firm, and
many an envious eye has been cast upon
their fine texture and rich coloring. Prices
are stiff, but there are many stout purses
in this city.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
The Norman Walkers celebrated their
eldest son’s coming-of-age by two gay par-
ties, at which originality was shown in the
decorations and manner of entertainment.
The weather, on which everything depended,
was in holiday mood, and for both dances,
the first held at the Walkers’ flat in Hole-
brook-place, the second on board the steamer
Togo, the moon shone, and the sea-breeze
forgot to cast its chilling breath upon the
proceedings. The garden of the flat was
illuminated by electric lamps of colors, and
supper was an al fresco affair. The Togo
cruised about the harbor while the dance
went on. Doreen and Ida Blaxland, of
Sydney, made two of the six debs, at the
first party, and Margaret O’Grady, in shell-
pink georgette and crystal, was a guest.
His Ex. and daughter Margaret were at
the lecture given by their guest Padre
Leonard, of Toe H, at the Town Hall. The
O’Grady was in the chair and made a fine
speech.
At the first 1928 luncheon of the Remem-
brance Club, presided over by its originator,
General Gellibrand. Major Jarvie (N.S.W.)
paid a tribute to the war work of his Tas-
manian wife. Mrs. Jarvie was a member of
the Y.M.C.A. voluntary staff in Paris for
three and a half years, after which she went
to America, and helped to collect two mil-
lion dollars for the relief of destitute French
children.
This little lady looks demure, but she is
a formidable critic of incompetence in civic
administration. She is Mrs. Edith Water-
worth, a great
worker in the
cause of child
welfare. She
holds strong
views on the
subject of
domestic econ-
omy, and reck-
ons that the
reason why so
many homes
are ruined
and infant
lives sacrificed
is that the
young wife
and mother
doesn’t know
her job. And as
censor of nine
years’ stand-
ing she has a
very poor opin-
ion of the
films showm in Australia.
The Repertory crowd coaxed Frank Clew-
low, Allan Wilkie’s stage director, to give
a lecture at the Town Hall on theatrical
affairs. The lecturer was for a long time
connected with the repertory movement in
Birmingham, and his audience gleaned many
practical hints.

Mr. J. Ken Wood finds a new use for a
Stock Whip:—
“We were mustering sheep in the Temora Road
frontage paddock and started up a full-grown fox.
I galloped up alongside him and got one good fall on
him across the back. He fell as dead as a door nail.
Whether the stroke of the whip affected the heart or
what, I don’t know, but gee, it was a beauty. The
whip must have fallen like a bar of iron, as there
was a bruise the size of a man’s hand, and the in-
side skin was cut. I have frequently killed
rabbits and snakes, but feel that in despatching this
lamb-murderer and poultry thief, which was a full-
grown dog fox, I have created quite a new field of
usefulness for a stock whip.” The above is taken
from a letter written to Messrs. Walther & Steven-
son, Ltd., the makers of “K’burra” all-Kangaroo
Stock Whips. He further stated that the whip he
purchased certainly fulfilled all expectations as to a
“life-like fall,” and hopes they will crack all over
Australia, as they are an acquisition to any man on
the land.

A Policeman on he’s beat
Found him soundly sleeping
Upon the pathway of a street.
He endeavored to arouse him,
But he’s efforts were in vain;
He was hushed in silent slumber
To never awake again.
Dead! the Policeman muttered.
As he raised he’s lantern light.
A victim for the city Morgue—
A nasty job at night.

Premier Butler’s bachelor and spinster
tax is evidently responsible for the follow-
ing advertisement in S.A. Advertiser:—
Man seeking exemption unjust tax would marry
lady, same reason; sign bond never meet again.
“Reciprocal,” this office.
“2LO : The “spiff” (B. 5/l/’2B) is now
an almost extinct form of remuneration for
shop-assistants in Victoria. One comxtany,
however, still adheres to it, and this is a
firm which has a shop in almost every town
of importance in the State. Only girls are
employed at the counters, and each gets a
commission on the sales she effects, the com-
mission often exceeding the fixed wage. One
manageress informed me that she had earned
a sum amounting to £9 per week during the
previous year on these commissions.
Viscount Burnham, who lately sold the
London Daily Telegraph, is a grandson of
Joseph Moses Levy, who, buying the paper
three months after Colonel Sleigh founded
it, made it the first penny sheet. It was a
power in the agitation leading to the 1858
Act enabling Jews to take seats in Parlia-
ment (a religious objection to the form ol
oath had been a barrier). Levy’s son changed
the family name to Lawson and became
Baron Burnham in 1904. The present Vis-
count bears the plain name of Harry Lawson.
He lias been a big figure in empire
journalism.
“Bumpkin” : Last year 85,000 new motor-
drivers were let loose upon the Victorian
pedestrian. The test remains a mere matter
of getting a bored policeman round a block
without damaging his nerve to such an extent
that he cannot sign the form. There is no
inquiry as to an aspirant’s eyesight, hearing,
moral or mental qualifications. A stone-blind
man hasn’t been found in charge of a car
yet, but a stone-deaf man was the other
day. And confirmed drunks turn up in the
courts every week.
“Hinemoa” : Prom a M.L. daily:—
Wanted, a Little Slight Woman as Housekeeper
to Bachelor in the country ; ideal little home.
I am still speculating whether he thinks she
will eat less, or be easier to manageV
“Adapter”: “Harold Hardupp” objects (B.
24/11/’27) to people getting paid on a copy-
right basis for their arrangements and adap-
tations of music by Beethoven, Mozart and
others. The piano is a much more grown-
up instrument now than it was in Beet-
hoven’s time. His instrument was a crude
affair of six or seven octaves; the modem
Steinway has eight and a quarter. All the
music of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach and many
another has in these days of entirely dif-
ferent instruments and a completely new
technique to be re-arranged and elaborated,
and among the men who have done this in
all reverence for the music’s creators are
Liszt, Busoni, Backhaus, Godowsky. Fried-
man and others like them. Kreisler has
rescued many a melody from oblivion by con-
verting it into exquisite violin music; why
shouldn’t he figure on. the pay-sheet for his
work ?
Nelson P. Whitelocke, who -went over the
hill a few days ago, was one of the first
men in Sydney to illustrate his own news-
paper reports. Thirty-odd years ago the
camera was hardly known in newspaper
offices, and Whitelocke used his pencil
instead. He had his best chance when he
was appointed editor of the Barrier Miner
in the silver-field’s early days; but he never
quite got the measure of Broken Hill. Law-
son, one of the explorers of the Blue Moun-
tains, was his grandfather.
“East Mexican” : That once roaring gold-
field, Charters Towers, has sunk very low
in the world these days ; it almost seems as
if the old goldfield's population cannot find it
in its heart to learn new tricks, as that now
prosperous dairying and farming centre,
Gympie, has done. The Towers has a splen-
did water supply from the Burdekin, is
within easy reach of a good port, and has a
rich country behind it. Yet the butter
factory established some years ago was a
failure. Then a big and up-to-date woollen
mill with £lOO,OOO capital, was erected,
and a fine modern plant installed. Over
£50,000 was spent in equipment, but the
balance of the capital now consists of unpaid
calls, and the factory is not operating, though
a bit of scouring for others is being done.
Primarily designed for top-making, the mill
lies close to some of Queensland’s finest wool-
growing country, with which it is connected
by rail, and is the only thing of its kind in
the North. Possibly the very bad seasons in
the N.W. during the past two or three years
have handicapped the enterprise, but the
frost was in evidence before that trouble
set in.
“Murkali”: The Sydney Gazette was
Australia’s first Sunday paper. The first
Sunday edition appeared on April 2, 1803.
the idea being to give a complete summary
of the previous week’s news, which largely
consisted of the arrival of ships. Previously
the paper appeared on Saturday, but so
many vessels had insisted on making port
late that day that the change was instituted.
The Gazette remained a Sunday paper for
seven years.
“Momokeni”: The establishment of a
garden in Papua on the lines of the famous
Peradineya and Hakgala Gardens of Cey-
lon has lately been discussed. There are
economic possibilities in New Guinea’s native
vegetation. In the jungles there are apples
with a true apple bouquet; luscious-looking
purple, blue and red plums with an acrid
juice wilich sets the teeth on edge for wpeks;
seedless lemons, mangosteens and countless
varieties of figs, nutmegs and other spices.
There is a fruit with the seeds of a quince
and the flavor of an apricot, and a seedless
orange with a flinty skin. The Ichichi nut is
very rich in oil, whilst the Catappa and Tal-
tal w’ould make connoisseurs rave. King of
the lot is the Okari nut (Terminalia olcari) :
it is two inches long and, raw, roasted or pre-
served in sugarcane juice, it is a delicacy
to dream of. All these nuts are produced
on the trees in prodigious quantities. There
is the cinnamon tree; a tree the bark of
which when cut scents the air for a hundred
yards round with aniseed ; and native rubber-
trees (Ficus rifjo ) which give out latex
equal to imported varieties. Just as Papuan
sugarcane has provided stocks for Fiji and
North Queensland, so the fruits, nuts and
other vegetable products might become a
source of prosperity long after goldfields
have become deserted dumps.

“The Girl Friend” continues to captivate
visitors to Her Majesty’s in Sydney. Muriel
Starr, now in her fourth week of popular
approval at the Palace in “Cornered,” will
switch over to a three-decker called “The
Eternal Magdalene” at the same house on
Saturday week. “Cradle Snatchers” of both
sexes will cease from inveigling the immature
into their toils at Theatre Royal after to-
morrow night. On Saturday the Vanbrugh-
Boucicault pair will breeze into this house
with Somerset Maugham’s “The Letter,”
which gets into its stride at once, with a
murder in the first act. “A Cuckoo in the
Nest” is still twittering bravely at the Cri-
terion. “Archie” is in its eleventh lap at the
St. James; “Mercenary Mary” is due for an
early brief revival by the same company.
“Mother Goose,” the panto, at the Grand
Opera House, is still laying golden eggs for
the Fullers and giving good value to the
audience. Van Lowe, “The Film Girl’s”
juvenile lead, is the magnet that draws the
flappers to the Empire.

Sydney’s million-pound motor show :
There are 200,000 motor vehicles in N.S.W., and
most of these appear, just at present, to have
taken up their abode in that town within a town,
the Sydney Royal Agricultural Ground. Two big
pavilions are stuffed full of new cars, motor-cycles
and accessories, and “used cars” —it isn’t fashionable
to call ’em secondhand now —are parked in the Wine
Kiosk. Proof that the Harbor City is at least sus-
pected of harboring millionaires is the presence of an
Isotta-Franschini tourer, a long, massive, wine-colored
brute with enough engine under its bonnet to make
100 miles an hour easy sailing. An English Daimler
limousine, with silver trimmings, modestly priced
at £1650, claims to be the most luxurious ’bus in
the place, but there are Rolls-Royces, Packards, Sun-
beams, Cadillacs and Crossleys that look, in their
way, equally as opulent. The trend towards the
small chubby car—the Austin “Tiger” was a notable
pioneer—has now spread from America to the
European Continent, and a Fiat “berbina” looks as
if it were made for a doll’s house. Color effects
are more daring than ever before, and a sweet
roadster in purplish-pink with scarlet, yellow and
blue trimmings is waiting to give the horses a
shock when it takes to the road. Not too good for
business is the used-car show, for the gallant old
chariots have been plated and enamelled till they
outshine the new stock. A statement affixed to
each of these exhibits, to the effect that it represents
the usual condition in which used cars are submitted
for sale on the shores of Port Jackson, takes a bit
of believing—but motor traders are honorable men.
As for the motor-cycles, they get smaller, more
efficient and more beautifully-finished each year. This
year’s crop, both English and American, look as if
they ought to have plush cases. As for accessories,
it would take about a year to inspect every exhibit,
and the show lasts only eight days, closing on Satur-
day.
* * * *
Ths only alterations in the current Sydney
Tivoli bill are in the half devoted to vaude-
ville, the Di Gatanos’ revue, “Dancing
Times,” remaining as it was last week. The
Cavanaghs are a stockwhip-cracking and
rope-spinning outfit consisting of a man, a
woman and a dog. Bromley Garter tells in
song the story of a day in a goose’s life,
each few lines being set to some popular air ;
after which he dons clerical garb and tears
a page out of Rupert Hazell’s copybook.
Armstrong and Phelps inject plenty of pep
and ginger into their turn, but a couple of
the rhymes that are accompanied by ukulele
strumming would be better overboard. The
entente cordiale that exists between the
audience and Millie Doris, as well as the
dancing trio, Clifford, Shand and Laurel
Streeter, remains unbroken.
Jim Gerald remains a delightfully irre-
pressible Dame in “Pantomime Revels” at
Sydney Fuller’s ; his clowning at the wash
tub is one of the brightest patches in a
thoroughly humorous show. Jim’s collabora-
tors include Phyllis du Barry, a principal
boy with little of the juvenile male’s robust-
ness, yet entertaining enough to satisfy the
most exacting.
* * * *
Although she is in love with an upright
young medico, the heroine of “A Million
Bid” at Sydney Lyceum is unkindly frog-
marched off to church by a money-hunting
mother to marry a wealthy waster. The lady
deserts the latter at the altar rails, but he
has the execrable manners to again intrude
between the heroine and her doctor-lover a
little later. Arriving as a chloroformed
patient on an operating-table with the doctor-
rival as the surgeon he seems to be badly
handicapped, and Heaven only knows what
mightn’t have happened to him in a Grand
Guignol play, but this being merely a movie he
returns to consciousness miraculously healed
by the man who should have been his most im-
placable enemy. “The American Beauty,” at
the same house and at the Empress, reveals a
millionaire in the act of being roped in by
a female “food-checker” in a hotel kitchen,
♦which impels the thought that the feminine
portion of American society must be a slow
lot to allow all their prospective husbands to
be lassoed by shopgirls and factory-hands.
“Running Wild” at the Haymarket is W. C.
Fields, a new screen comedian who, as a
henpecked hubby and bullied employee who
turns against his persecutors, infuses a lot of
originality into an old theme. “College,”
under the same roof, portrays the escapades
of a soft-headed young student; there is
some capital satire beneath the surface.
“Spring Fever,” raging at Hoyt’s, is a pic-
ture that will interest golfers; a partner
film features the stirring adventures of Buck
Jones. “The Night Bride” is entertaining
Lyric patrons by her wily advances to a
misogynist; the parson pockets the usual fees
at the final fade out. “The Circus of Life,”
another Lyric feature, gives a glimpse of
Russia when the Bolshie was only a small,
dark cloud on the horizon. “Resurrection,”
“What Price Glory,” “Ben Ilur” and “F'alse
Shame” are still holding their own at the
Crystal Palace. Prince Edward, Piccadilly
and Adyar Hall.

Among the Archibald exhibits:—
There were 66 entries for the Archibald Prize
this year—the plum is now worth £s6o—and it
would be interesting to have the opinion of The
Bulletin’s old chief as to how many of the
artists’ subjects had won that distinction, in art,
literature or anything else, which he regarded as
desirable if not essential. Certainly the small boy
and the pinkly-pleated flapper submitted by Mclnnes
could lay no claim to eminence in any of the walks
of life suggested. Nor, for that matter, can the
original of the winning portrait by George Lam-
bert, excepting perhaps by proxy, the lady being
the mother of Keith Murdoch, of the Melbourne
Herald. Lambert’s fine piece of work, a study in re-
strained coloring, represents an elderly lady with
iron-grey hair; about her shoulders she wears a
silver-grey fox fur. The front of a wine-colored
frock, against which an amethystine necklet gleams,
and two rows of pearls about the throat furnish the
clothes detail of which Lambert is so fond. Near
by Mary Edwards has plunged into a riot of color,
scarlet and green and blue. This portrait of Mrs.
Dorothy Murray is so badly hung that it is hard to
measure its color values, but it is boldly executed. Of
E. Buckmaster’s offerings the most notable is that
styled “My Mother,” a striking and appealing bit
of realism. The quick and the still are combined
in the best of the five Mclnnes works. This depicts
the painter just about to make an epic onslaught
on a canvas, while at his side a jug, a bowl and a
lemon suggest the imminence of a pleasing inter-
lude for refreshment. Maoriland artist Bowling is
to be commended for his vivid representation of
Arundel Orchard. Lawson Balfour and Norman
Carter, J. S. Watkins, Lyall Trindall and Jerrold
Nathan are others whose work shows quality.

The Australian Commonwealth Band’s
invasion of Melbourne Capitol—the movie
theatre whose interior looks like a gigantic
advt. for perfect teeth —is in its second week
and shows no signs of being less popular with
the multitude. The much-travelled melo-
dists claim to have played 100,000 miles
around the world. This Page last listened
to them in the middle of a heatwave on
the Exhibition Oval when their notes had
to be put on ice before they could be heard,
but at the Capitol they are housed in the
sort of ornate surroundings only lavished
nowadays, as a rule, on American films.
Their admirable playing of the “William
Tell” overture was a sufficient explanation
of their successful tour. It scarcely needed
the assistance of the stage meteorologist who
switched the lights off and on in the part
about the tempest. Under Conductor Baile’s
mild ministrations the band has learnt to pull
together, and the balance of its parts is
remarkably good. Incidentally, “Seventh
Heaven,” the pictured story of the Paris
sewer-worker who could not be kept down,

“All the King’s Horses” and all Bouci-
cault’s men ceased trying to put Humpty
McKinnel together again last night at Mel-
bourne King’s, and that theatre will present
a shuttered but loquacious front to the
passerby until Saturday week (28th),
when Leon Gordon will reburst upon the
town in something rich and strange in
mystery plays. For the mellerdramatic
needs of “The Trial of Mary Dugan” the
audience will be empanelled as the jury, it
is said. One timid old lady has been in-
quiring of the management whether, in the
event of the house not coming to a unani-
mous decision, she will be locked up all
night.
There is extraordinary energy about Ann
Suter, the Girl from Dixie, now shaking
snorts, grunts and other marks of high
approval out of Melbourne Tivoli patrons.
Ann’s face is as elastic as the principles of
a politician, her joints are all built on the
universal system, and her legs are respon-
sive to every change of feeling in the owner.
Ann is not burdened with any false modesty
about her bust. The only thing she doesn’t
do with that part of her anatomical suite
is to take it off and heave it at the audience.
When she sings a meaningful jazz ditty and
simultaneously brings all the various sep-
arate portions of herself into violent action
the effect is overwhelming. Coming after
Ann, the more sober items on the programme
seem to be standing still.

An unusual exhibit in the dumb drama
section this week in Melbourne is “Barbed
Wire,” which is the Paramount Theatre’s
effort to win the Nobel prize for peace. In
“Barbed Wire” Pola Negri, who is a Pole,
abandons her usual occupation of chasing q
human lover and seeks to portray the affec-
tion which should exist between nations, but
doesn’t. In a series of impressive, scenes an
internment camp is shown in which misery
makes all men brothers. There is some
remarkably quiet and effective acting.
* * * *
At Melbourne Princess “Robinson Crusoe”
still clings to his raft and 12 performances
a week, though attendances scarcely warrant
the heavy burden put upon the cast in a
month of recurrent heat waves. The
Athenaeum continues to set “The Alarm
Clock” for 8.15, and 2.30 Wed. and Sat.
* * * *
“The Student Prince” is in the eleventh
week of his term at His Majesty’s, Mel-
bourne, and the warbling of the Forty Sing-
ing Schoolboys is as glorious as ever. Beppie
de Yries is growing out of some vaudevillean
habits, such as wffiooping on top notes, and
visits she has paid to the Albert-street Con.
may have something to do with it.
Melbourne’s pantos, continue to put up
endurance records with 12 performances per
theatre a week, but if the damsels who shake
limber legs about the island of “Robinson
Crusoe” at the Princess, and the crowd who
throng the pen of “Mother Goose” at the
Playhouse, are feeling the strain, their audi-
ences aren’t allowed to know it.
❖ * * *
Josephine Head is one of the main attrac-
tions of “Queen High” at Melbourne Royal.
The usually staid stage notes of J. C.
Williamson, Ltd., state that she is the
possessor of the finest pair of legs in Europe.
Not having examined all the others, The
Bulletin is not in a position to deny it,
but is ready to admit that the lady dances
delightfully.

The movies at Melbourne Hoyt’s this week
savor of the seasons, with William Haines
starring in “Spring Fever” and Madge Bel-
lamy as the joyous lead of “Summer Bache-
lors.” An extra bright bit of film', “Sky-high
Saunders,” is an additional attraction for
afternoon sessions. Thrill and near-tragedy are
the spice of “A Million Bid” that features
Dolores Costello at the Majestic this week,
Betty Blythe and Warner Oland helping
to keep the tambourine a-rolling. “The
Red Raiders” are naturally Injuns, and
Ken Maynard is the leading light in a First
National story of ’Murza’s Civil War. On
Saturday Irene Rich makes reappearance in
“Dearie,” an eye-opener upon the thorny
path of the cabaret performer.

At the Adelaide Theatre Royal Nellie
Bramley.’s appearance in “Camille,” in
modern dress and setting, made one wonder
how “The Three Musketeers” would look
in Oxford bags and Norfolk jackets. Such
an old-time love story might be held to
require the atmosphere of the period, but
Nellie draws tears from hundreds of eyes
when she finally dies of T.B. on a winter’s
night in a decollete nightdress and trans-
parent net wrapper. Kyle McAllister gives
good support as Armand, and Ethel Bash-
ford provides comedy as Madame Prudence.
At the Majestic Theatre George Storey is
an entertaining porter in a revue labelled
“Find the Lady,” and Arthur Aldridge’s
vocal numbers meet with appreciation. Pat
Hanna’s Diggers continue to hand out some
original humor at the Garden Theatre, with
Louise Meadows and Ernest Kopke as
popular vocalists. West’s Pictures are
strong on the sawdust. In “The Unknown”
Alonzo the Armless is the butt, and later
a stage performance is given by Abdy’s
Circus. The Wondergraph is screening
“Around Mount Gambier,” a Commonwealth
Government film, in addition to some of the
usual fare. The York Theatre provides
plenty of thrills in “Fighting Love,” where
the scene shifts from Italy to the Sahara.
At the' Grand “Good as Gold” gives Buck
Jones a chance to score as a gunman, • a
couple of train robberies being thrown in
for good measure.
“Lud”: In the name part of Barrie’s
“Peter Pan,” which is having its 24tli annual
production in London, is Jean Forbes Robert-
son, who as Miss McEwan drew attention
to herself by her engaging performances of
ingenue parts when touring Australia with
her mother, Lady Forbes Robertson. _ The
original Smee (George Shelton) is still in
the bill. Shelton, now over 70, toured Aus-
tralia with J. L. Toole over a quarter of
a century ago.
“L.H.P.”: Apolloni’s “The Jew,” listed in
the Fuller opera scheme, was first done here
by the Lyster and Cagli co. in the ’seventies.
The opera was originally produced in 1855,
and went the round of all the theatres in
Italy. It is founded on a melodrama of a
rough and ready description, and the scene
is laid in Granada during the Moorish
occupation of Spain. During 1873-75 Lyster
and Cagli gave Australia as novelties “The
Jew,” “Moses in Egypt,” “Dinorah,” “John
of Preston,” “The Jewess,” “Louisa Miller,”
“Polinto” and “I Lombardi.” They had
pluck and enterprise in those days.
“Betise”: A London journal has been
running a symposium on cinema “howlers.”
One is the flying of the Union Jack at a
time when that banner did not exist —that
was in “Captain Blood.” In the “Sea
Hawk” the heroine is escorted by a Borzoi
wolfhound. The Russian tyke was not known
in the West till centuries later. In “The
Sea Beast” Barrymore gives his sweetheart
a puppy. Long after, when he returns as
an old man, the Metlmsalhound is on deck
to welcome him home. An Australian example
is the appearance of Maurice Frere in “The
Term of His Natural Life” wearing the
mess dress of a British officer, a rig that
was not sanctioned by “Dress Regs” until
long after the passing of the “system.” Less
excusable is the saluting of the Admiral on
his quarter deck in “The Flag Lieutenant"
by the capless lieutenant-hero. And many
naval officers and men took part in the
screening of this film, including this par-
ticular scene!

HARDY’S WINES OF TINTARA
CAPT JOHN MACARTHUR was one of the earliest pioneers of the Colony of New South Wales, and during the regime of Governor
Phillip established a small flock of merino sheep at Parramatta.
From this small beginning the production of wool has reached its present amazing proportions, and at the present time it is clearly
proved to be the strongest asset Australia possesses. .
The establishment of Hardy’s vineyards in 1853 places them among the earliest, and Champion Reserve Pore is the quintessence ol
quality resulting from these years of experience and maturity.

Poverty
Point
“Cauboy”: Why do producers insist on
stags characters shutting the door after
them? It would not be done in real life,
except perhaps in midwinter. As a result
of the ridiculous convention, the interior
play becomes a maddening tournament of
door-slamming, which keeps the wall and the
painted bookcase in a continual amusing
wobble. Boucicault is credited with being
a sound stage architect, but his “All the
King’s Horses” in Melbourne was a particu-
larly terrible example of the habit. On
the opening night one door kept swinging
open after it had been banged, so Dion placed
a hand on duty behind it. Every time a
character made an exit a glimpse of fleeing
pants’ ends preceded him and some of the
public concluded that this was part of the
plot. Then Norman McKinnel closed the
door and suddenly re-opened it, revealing to a
guffawing house the dismayed property-man
on his knees. It wouldn’t have affected the
play in the slightest if the door had been
left open.
“Gabbett”: The protest of a finicking
purist in the British Commons because the
Home Secretary refused to stop a theatrical
reproduction of an execution recalls the old
thriller “The Man They Could Not Hang,”
founded on the actual experience of a West
of England murderer who was reprieved
after the drop had thrice refused to act.
Additional thrill was added to the piece one
night when the supposedly immovable drop
gave way under the hero, breaking up the
show and some of the actor’s ribs. The
writer once saw a version of “Robert
Emmet,” which included the execution as
a grand finale, played by a bunch of Western
Queensland strollers in a shearing shed.
Somehow The Patriot got his foot caught
in the rope as he went through the trap
(it was beautifully worked with the wool-
press as gallows). His language as he
hung head downwards was equal to any
ever used in that shed.
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) : Australian-born
Cicely Courtneidge has blossomed into one
of the best character actresses in England.
Years of hard work have developed latent
talent, and in “Clowns in Clover” at the
Adelplii she and her husband, Jack Hulbert,
have caught the fancy of the town. The
piece is all British, written by three English-
men, and the fees are said to be small com-
pared with payments made for overseas
pieces. And even them American produc-
tions have nearly always to be written afresh
before being staged here, though the local
scribes draw very small percentages.
“Cauboy”: In giving Maorilander Molly
Raynor the star part in “The Alarm Clock,”
Melbourne Athenaeum has once more had
better luck or shown more judgment in the
local field than the Firm. The Athenaeum’s
good picks also include Dulcie Bland, who
was a dramatic success in “The Last Warn-
ing,” and Iverrie Kelly, another ex-Reper-
torian, who is shortly off to London.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : The most unusual
announcement I’ve heard made in a theatre
marks Robert Loraine’s management of the
Apollo, where he is playing “Cyrano de
Bergerac.” * The gallery is always filled
witli lovers of the romantic drama, scores
of them young girls, and the janitor cheerily
announces in a voice to be heard all over
the theatre: “You may smoke, ladies!” And
they do.
“L. de Rideau”: Owen Nares, a J.C.W.
attraction of 1928, has starred in almost
everything, from Shakspeare to musi-
comedy, but the part most cherished by his
romantic admirers is his Mark Sabre in that
odd fish of drama, “If Winter Comes.” He
is less renowned, however, for the quality of
EXPERIENCED.
CLAUDE: “You can always tell a revue actress
MAUDE: “Yes, but you can’t tell her much.”
his acting than for the beauty of his personal
appearance. Never since Superbus Knight’s
calves shrank has such a matinee idol been
flung to the gods.
“J.L.W.”: I disagree with Keith Barry’s
statement that Ethel Osborn was “praised
by critics before ever she went to the State
Conservatorium” (B. 8/12/’27). Miss
Osborn came from Brisbane, where she was
just a local singer, and commenced study
under Roland Foster in 1920. She appeared
later at minor concerts and students’ recitals
without attracting special attention, and it
was not until 1923 that she came into pro-
minence at a Town Hall concert given by
the Welsh Choral Society. In 1921 Clara
Butt heard, among others, both her and Elsie
Ackland, but picked neither. Four years
later, however, Miss Osborn had so improved
that Dame Clara was anxious to introduce
her at the Albert Hall.
“C. Ockney”: An incurably optimistic
entrepreneur named Sacks continues to pro-
vide London with various entertaining ex-
periments in theatrical production. Since,
with a beginner’s luck, he made a lot of
money out of “The Lilac Domino” at the
now-defunct Empire, Sacks has, through the
failure of ambitious stage ventures, twice
gone through the Bankruptcy Court. When
he took the Gaiety recently and staged his
latest musical comedy, “The Girl from Cook's,”
he boldly announced that as only about
three song-and-dance leading ladies were
worth their high salaries he had engaged
an untried prima donna to whom he would
pay only £3O weekly, instead of the £3OO
demanded by Evelyn Laye, to whom he made
the first offer. The piece lasted five weeks.
“Mid-channel”: I’m greatly mistaken if it
was not in “The Prisoner of Zenda” that
Gaston Mervale made his first bow to Aus-
tralian audiences (“H.P.,” B. 5/l/’2B).
Also, though I have known this artist per-
sonally for over 20 years, I cannot remember
his ever having played Scarpia. It was as
a producer that Mervale really displayed
talent. Apart from Boucicault and Asclie,
I doubt whether he had an equal.
“G.A.P.”: The use of foreign-sounding
names by English tenors (“A.G.M.,” B.
5/l/’2B) applies also to Australians, though
with them it gets a slightly different twist.
If they adopt some handle like “Austral”
or “Melba,” which acknowledges country or
native town, all is forgiven, but if Mabel
Lcggins becomes Olga Leginskaja or John
Collins calls himself Signor Giovanni Collini
the cries of “Shame!” are loud and bitter.
Two who recently accepted the alien names
a London manager gave them, when the
alternative was no contract, have disgusted
their friends on this side, and a young singer
from the same town whom the citizens re-
cently sent to Europe had to sign an agree-
ment that she would never change her name.
That promise will probably prove fatal to
the clever and enthusiastic young lady when
she asks for engagements in Europe.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : The sudden collapse
of “The Girl from Cook’s” at the Gaiety
has sharply revealed some hardships of the
minor folk who strut in the brilliant back-
ground, smiling to song-time, yet wondering
how they are to pay their rent. Ugly
stories got into the papers about the chords
threatening to take their properties to Bow-
street, being searched at the stage door
and locked in the theatre, and getting home
at 2 a.m. The piece cost a fortune to pro-
duce and ran only five weeks, which seems
to prove something more is wanted than a
trial spin in the provinces. That famous
septuagenarian William Farren has written
to the press with a suggestion that an in-
stitution like the Actors’ Equity of America
night help the English stage.
“St. John’s Wood” (Lond.) ; Beecham’s
scheme for a national opera is not going
well. Only £lO,OOO has been subscribed to-
wards the fund of £200,000, and if the rest
is not in by February 1 the scheme falls
through .
“Bardie”: In the cast of “The Seventh
Heaven,” the movie that is pulling ’em into
the Capitol, Melbourne, is old friend Albert
Gran. I had not heard of him since he
appeared here in the first production of
“Sweet Nell of Old Drury.” That outbreak
occurred at the Melbourne Princess on Feb-
ruary 15, 1902. Nellie Stewart was Nell
Gwynne, Harcourt Beatty was King Charles,
and Gran was a sinister Lord Jeffreys.
Sydney Stirling, Harry Hill and Claude
Flemming were also in the bill.
“Ca'.sar’s Ghost”: Edgar Wallace gets a
whacking cheque for royalties following
Moscovitch’s long Sydney season with “The
Terror” and “The Ringer.” In various parts
of the world, including Germany, at least
10 companies are earning royalties for the
man who started life as the adopted son of
a fish-porter and spent several years as
Tommy. Wallace, whose books are best-
sellers, ’ too, struck his first success with a
verse on the sinking of 11.M.5. Victoria,
which Arthur Roberts sang for years.
“C. 8.”: London newspapers strongly cen-
sured the flower-distribution which followed
the last curtain of “The Wrecker’s” first
night, and it was probably Australian entre-
preneur E. J. Carroll who was to blame.
That enthusiastic theatrician would send up
floral emblems to Gabriel and every member
of the celestial choir if the playing of the
Last Trump pleased him. After all, it is a
harmless folly, like the sprig of parsley on a
cutlet, and nobody is deceived by it. Bouci-
cault is credited with an austere devotion to
art because he makes the vegetation-donors
go round to the tradesmen’s entrance, so to
speak, yet he isn’t above practising other in-
nocuous monkeyshines of the producer, such
as reading telegrams to his audiences and
picking actresses more for their aristocratic
birth than their histrionic qualifications.
“Goldilocks” : Theatrical management looks
the easiest thing in the word, but amateurs
who blissfully butt in mostly get nothing out
of it except scorched fingers. The partners
of a city printing firm and. a Sydney boys’
schoolmaster who backed the Grand Guignol
venture at the St. James are the latest to
put their fingers in bandages. Like the
shows arranged last year by Concert Tours,
Ltd., it deserved success, and, also like them,
it failed through lack of knowledge in the
steering of theatrical craft. The classic Aus-
tralian example of amateur failure was the
crash of Stephenson, who organised a first-
rate musical comedy co. that lasted only six
months. In learning that theatrical manage-
ment isn’t easy he spent £30,000.
“Hamfat”: The Melvilles, whose juicy
bellowdramas are still being aired by tour-
ing theatrical companies in Australia, have
hereditary instinct for what the public wants
and how to give it. A distant progenitor
was one Robbins, who took the name of
Charles Melville and married an actress, and
all his descendants have been concerned with
the stage and married on it. The father of
the present crowd was Andrew Melville,
theatrical manager, whose six children all
took to grease-paint; one son, Andrew Emm,
also wrote a drama or so. The other two,
Walter and Frederick, made coin with titles
full of “girl.” Walter’s efforts, besides
“The Worst Woman in London,” have in-
cluded the girls who would Cross Roads,
Who Lost Her Character, Who Took the
Wrong Turning, Who Wrecked His Home,
and who is described as “Shopsoiled.”
Frederick produced “The Bad Girl of the
Family” and some assorted characters like
“The Ugliest Woman on Earth.” Now, in
their early fifties, the brothers run both the
Lyceum and Prince’s.
“Adam Ant” : No one was more thorough
in selecting artists and putting on grand
opera than George Musgrove. His first Aus-
tralian season was in 1901, when he imported
to these shores Cecile Lorraine, Lilian Coom-
ber, Agnes Jansen, Louis Ahrens, Umberto
Salvi, Charles Tilbury and Max Eugene.
Gustav Slapoffski made his first bow here
with that galaxy. The opening explosion
was “II Trovatore,” and the repertoire in-
cluded “Lohengrin,” “Tannhauser,” “The
Flying Dutchman,” “Faust,” “Carmen,”
“Maritana” and “Bohemian Girl.” “Lohen-
grin” was a great success and “Tannhauser”
was played 11 times in three weeks to full
houses. In 1902 Musgrove brought Melba
back to her homeland for a concert
tour —her first appearance here as a world
figure—and she also appeared in selections
from “Faust,” “La Traviata” and “Rigo-
letto,” assisted by Madame Slapoffski, Louis
Ahrens, Lempriere Pringle and De Bensuade.
Three years later Musgrove brought in the
German opera co., but the strife and jeal-
ousy of the performers wrecked that great
artistic venture. Musgrove, a big man in
everything, never quite recovered from that
blow.
UNBLENDABLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A London manager finds the reason for some
recent disturbances at first nights in the fact that the
cultured people in the stalls and the movie addicts
in the gallery look at new plays from quite differ-
ent angles.”
The stallite brings a palate trained, as all
must be aware,
A cultivated taste to sample new dramatic
fare;
From Shakespeare down to Shaw he’s wise
to all the Thespian clan,
But no traditions such as these enslave the
movie fan.
No play of wit, no subtleties or nuances for
him
Who’s filled with hooch of Hollywood his
tankard to the brim.
He craves his drama hot and strong, and
hurls a noisy ban
At aught that smacks of highbrow stuff, the
forthright movie man.
He likes his heroes gun-begirt, he-men from
head to heel;
His happy heroines must have slie-women’s
sex appeal.
What charm in strawberries for the beast
that craves a mash of bran,
Or fain would prickly thistles munch? —so
with the movie fan.
On sock-and-buskin some were raised, but
more upon the flicks ;
Some keep Melpomene in mind while others
swear by Mix.
Some memories recall the days when Irving’s
sway began,
But Chaplin marks the start of things for
your true movie fan.
Above, the gods ; below, the intellectual elite ;
Each finding poison in whate’er the other
warrants meat.
Your modern playwright needs must be a
wonder if he can
Win, while the critics purr applause, cheers
from the movie fan.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHILE, flock following snowy flock,
Gulls to their rest are winging,
Sunset out of the lustrous west
Purple and rose is flinging.
Still and breezeless the Harbor lies,
Bordered by glowing highlands.
No wave breaks on its gleaming rocks;
None on its gem-like islands.
Ships a-many, like fabled ships—
Ships of the Realm of Story—•
Lie at anchor with mast and hull
Steeped in the purple glory.
Smoke, slow rising from ship and shore,
Touched by the magic splendor,
Makes a veil that the moon peers through,
Crescent and pale and tender.
Over it, lit and lovely clouds
Rent by a wind asunder,
Domed and distant the city lies
Wrapped in a robe of wonder.
While, flock following snowy flock,
Gulls to their nest are flying,
Fades the purple and rose to grey—
All in a moment dying.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JOHN CHESTER forced his stunned
mentality to recapture the little black
words dancing crazily across the thick
notepaper in his hand. For the third time
he. read them, and still their hideous pur-
port remained unchanged.
Son and Agnes were married. There it
was in Agnes’s own handwriting on the
thick, pale, lavender paper she always used.
He could even smell the fresh, sweet lavender
in which she stored it. Lavender ? Lavender ?
Yes, he remembered now. He had planted
bush on bush of it, in readiness for the
coming of his lavender lady. And now she
was never coming—had married Sonnie this
morning!
A light glimmered, and with an involun-
tary shiver he stood up. Since reading the
letter he had sat on dumbly while Night
laid her blurring fingers on the landscape.
That sturdy square of darkness against the
pale horizon was the home on Son’s selection.
Cashes lived there, helping in the work on
both selections, while he and Son had always
resided at Farview, on his —John’s —place.
Now Cashes would go, and Sonnie and Agnes
live at Plainways. Soon, very soon, it would
be Agnes who would set that yellow flame
out there against the night.
A voice called him to tea, a brisk, cheer-
ful voice, that immediately swept into the
notes of an old song, as the owner bustled
about the table laid for the evening meal.
Mrs. Granger smiled genially on him as he
came in. As a young woman she had entered
the Chester home, and when the boys had
been robbed of both parents by a tragic
accident she and her husband had devoted
themselves to the welfare of the two boys
and their affairs. To John she was much
attached, but Son was the idol of her heart,
as was only natural, for when the flood-
waters closed over the heads of Jean and
John Chester he was a mere baby of five,
while John, jun., was already a youth
of seventeen. The tragedy had seemed to
crush most of the youthfulness out of a
character always inclined to seriousness,
and from that moment life had meant for
John Chester only work, and car-3 of the
baby brother that death had thrown into
his strong arms.
“Tea’s just ready,” she said, cheerfully,
stopping in her soft song, “and Bob is wash-
ing. He won’t be a minute. Was there a
letter fi’om Son?” she added. The house
was inexpressibly lonely without Son. She
missed his laughing nonsense at every turn.
She would be glad when his holiday was over.
“Not from Son—from Agnes,” John said,
slowly, and wondered if it was possible she
did not detect the strangeness of his voice.
The old lady sugared the teacups, a beam-
ing smile on her sweet old face. “They’ll
be enjoying themselves, that pair,” she said,
indulgently. “It was nice for Sonnie to get
away—and they do enjoy each other’s com-
pany so.”
John Chester laughed. “Yes,” he said.
“Oh, yes.”
There w T as all at once the very deuce of a
pulse throbbing in his head. It hammered
away like mad. Queer that they didn’t hear
it.
Bob had come in, and was standing in the
doorway, pulling on a coat. John laughed
again. “So nice that they’ve decided to—to”
His dry throat refused to go on.
Mrs. Granger stood up in alarm. “My
dear boy, whatever is the matter?”
John turned to Bob as he sauntered in,
and laughed again. “I’m just telling Aunty
B. that Son and Agnes were married this
morning. She hardly seems to credit the
good news.” He looked from one to the
other with burning eyes, a dull red creeping
into his ashen face. His numbed brain was
only just beginning to grasp the bitter depths
of his betrayal, the enormity of the humilia-
tion they had put upon him.
The two old people stared at him, silently.
He was frightening with that strange red
fury in his eyes.
“John, dear, there’s some dreadful mistake.
Agnes and Sonnie could not do this —this”
—she broke off. for John was not listening.
“They’ll be back after the honeymoon to
take up their residence at Plainways—son
added a little note to Agnes’s to tender that
information.” He looked straightly at ths
old woman. “I suppose I can leave it in
your hands, Aunty 8., to see that everything
belonging to—to George is removed to his
future home. Everything, mind. It will be
safer—l mean he will be wiser if he never
sets foot in my house again.”
Mrs. Granger nodded dumbly. She wanted
to say a thousand things to this man with
the tortured eyes, but they did not come
easily before that terrible look.
John stood up, suddenly. “Excuse me, I
I don’t want any tea, after all. I think 1 a
go for a stroll.” He felt he must walk and
walk till the cool night air soothed his
hammering brain.
To the east the river timber seemed to
open shadowy arms to him, and thither his
footsteps carried him. The thought came
that, though he walked till he stepped over
the edge of the world, Agnes was still lost
to him. Not only Agnes, but Son, too.
By their treachery he had lost them both,
the only two lie had cared for in the world.
In God’s name why hadn’t they told him?
Why hadn’t Agnes asked for her release?
Surely they could have saved him humilia-
tion —need not have added that to his be-
trayal? Over and over in his brain the
same bitter round of questions ran, till he
swung his hands above his head and cursed
them both. In a month Agnes was to have
married him—Agues, with the steadiest
grey eyes in the world, and the sweetest
mouth. And now Son had stolen her. God!
God! Cod!
Ilis brain was going like the very
hammers of Hell again; he beat on his
temple with a clenched hand till he staggered
and clutched a tree for support. Above him
an owl voiced his harsh philosophy. John
laughed hoarsely, but the sound steadied him
oddly. “Ay, lost soul, lost soul!” he agreed,
with a burst of sardonic amusement, and
turned to retrace his footsteps, slowly.
Love had come late to John Chester —
had come to him at thirty-eight, when he
had first seen Agnes Fortune. She was a
shy, gentle girl, with a delicate oval of
face lft with steady grey eyes and a smile
of rare sweetness, and the passion of this
lover, almost twice her age, had swept her
off her feet. She had fallen in love with
love, and within three months of knowing
her John had slipped a diamond circlet on
her finger.
Son, dallying on a protracted holiday, up
in the North, on an uncle’s station, had not
seen the girl till after she became engaged
to John. John marked their instant gay
approval of each other with satisfied eyes.
It was the one thing needed to perfect his
happiness. He enjoyed the merry badinage
indulged in by them almost as much as
they did themselves. That kind of thing was
beyond him, did not fit in with his quieter
temperament; but he loved to see it in Sou
and Agnes. To be jealous never entered his
mind. Son was his brother; and his honor
had always been a crystal-clear thing. Agnes
—why, Agnes was the girl who had promised
him her love, with her honest, candid soul
shining in her grey eyes.
* * * *
Two letters came to Farview in Son’s firm
handwriting during the following fortnight,
and Mrs. Granger’s heart contracted as she
saw John thrust each one carelessly into
the heart of the fire, unread. She touched
his shoulder gently, as she saw the second
one flame brightly a second, then become
a distorted black shadow.
“Are you wise, John?” The old eyes
behind their spectacles were brimming with
tears.
Chester looked down at her. He was un-
shaven, his eyes bloodshot, for he had been
drinking heavily since the advent of the
lavender letter, and it was taking heavy toll
of a system entirely unused to such ex-
cesses.
“Mine eyes have been opened to the light
—I am wise, indeed, Aunty 8.,” he said,
with a sharp, curt laugh.
The old lady hurried away to her room
to cry silently and beg for guidance, for
she belonged to an old school. The under-
current of derisive mockery in laughter that
had always been so tender was a sword
atwist in the old woman’s breast.
The culprits came home, with what trepi-
dation and lagging footsteps perhaps only
Mrs. Granger guessed. She knew Son must
be suffering an agony of remorse. She
thought, with a twisted mouth, that it must
have been a strange honeymoon, for each
was built of too fine a fibre not to ceaselessly
regret the impulse of passion that had led
them along the Judas-patli.
They were sitting at the evening meal
when Son stepped into the doorway, where
the light fell strongly on him.
Mrs. Granger, with a little inarticulate
cry, ran to him, and put her arms about
her laddie, heedless or defiant of the antago-
nistic silence shadowing the room.
With an effort Son smiled, and kissed her,
then put her aside. He looked at his
brother, quietly spreading his bread with
butter. Surely—surely this was not im-
placable hatred? His dry throat moved and
made no sound; then “Dono” he choked. Th'
word was his baby effort at “John,” ana
still came in moments of emotion.
John looked squarely at the old woman.
“I think everything belonging to George has
been removed,” he said levelly, and as she
nodded dumbly, “Thanks, that’s right”; then
“Pass me the butter, please, Bob.” But he
let Bob Granger reach across the table and
place it close, not offering to take it, lest
he disclose the trembling of his hands.
Son winced back a step, and the dull color
ran into his face. Without a word he turned
and went out into the darkness, across to
Agnes, waiting tremblingly at the gate.
She sensed his despair, in the touch of
his arms; for the dusk made of his features
only a white blur.
“My dear,” she said with a little sob,
when Son told her the result of the brief
interview. “Oh, Son, he will never forgive
us—never! Ah, if I hadn’t been such a
cowardly fool —if I had let you go to him
first. I know now that’s what I should
have done. He is big enough, fine enough
to have forgiven us. But I was such a
fool. Oh, Son, such a cowardly fool!”
She began to sob in earnest, and the
young husband held her close. “Belovedest,
don’t cry,” he begged. “Don’t cry so. He
will forgive us soon. He must, dear, because
he has been brother and father and mother
to me all ray life. We couldn’t live in the
same world ignoring each other; the thing’s
not possible.”
Back at Farview two men were getting it
hot and strong from an indignant lady.
“You might have given him your hand. Bob
Granger,” she ended her tirade, hotly. “Pray
who set you up to be judge? ‘Dono,’” she
repeatedly chokingly, looking at John —“if
he had spoken so to me I’d have walked

barqjiooted across a continent to go to him.”
John thrust back his chair and went out,
leaving the bread he had buttered with such
elaborate care quite untouched.
The lamp was lit in a Plainways window,
and he winced from it like a physical hurt,
going to sit in his own dark room and
nurse his hurt in the silence, like a suffering
animal. But when he drew up his blind to
thrust up the window and let the cool night
air penetrate the close, suffocating atmo-
sphere of the shut ropm the light gleaned
friendJOy across the dark at him.
His brooding eyes fixed on it, he sat there
thinking thoughts that were like rough fin-
gers on a new wound.
Did they sit beside their window, with the
lamp making a halo around Agnes’s gold
head, a little bowed to-night, because of him?
Or was it perhaps their bedroom—Agnes
with braided hair, and tiny white feet,
beneath a long gown! Agnes, Son’s wife?
He jerked the blind down with sudden
savageness: That light—curse it! It was
mocking him, mocking him with the very
friendliness of its twinkling. It was like
Agnes’s eyes, Son’s hand stretched out to
him in a beseeching silence.
He undressed in the dark, flung himself
into bed and swore that he would never light
a lamp in his window to carry a message
to the Judas pair at Plainways." Son might
look sometimes at the house bulking black
against the horizon, but he should never be
able to say, “There is the light in John’s
room.” The thought gave him an odd, warped
satisfaction, warming to his bitterness. It
was as though the lamp in the window were
an actual message, and he had ignored it
as stonily as he had ignored Son himself.
Son made one more overture. He met
John coming out of the village pub just at
dusk, and the sight of his unshaven face
and unkempt appearance cut him to the
quick—John who had always been the soul
of fastidiousness. The older brother looked
up with a sound approaching a snarl when
he saw who it was that barred his path.
“John —old man,” faltered Son, half under
his breath, and then recoiled involuntarily
before the hatred in a pair of blazing, blood-
shot eyes.
“Out of my way—Judas!” and the voice,
too, was surcharged with hate.
Son did not go in for a drink. He waited
a moment till John had ridden away, and
then launched himself into the saddle and
rode home. Had he gone on into the hotel
be would have found sundry of the bar in-
habitants applying restoratives to a fool
who had tried to express a bibulous sym-
pathy over John’s perfidious brother and
one-tame promised wife.
From that night Son lost heart. Up till
then he had nursed the idea that time would
soften John’s attitude; but that look, that
voice! It began to seem that John’s hate
was a tangible thing, shadowing the Plain-
ways homestead. Something evil that stifled
laughter and peace and well-being. Agnes
watched the growing moodiness and depres-
sion of her young husband with frightened
grey eyes. He who had captured her heart
by the very goldenness of his laughter had
forgotten the way to laugh.
When Agnes knew a baby was coming the
fear deepened in the girl’s grey eyes. What
home was this to bring a tiny mortal to,
this home they had dreamed of making
elorious, and across which now lay only
the sinister shadow'- of a brother’s hatred!
Hundred of years before, a slender, grey-
eyed girl of the Fortunes, with a pale oval
of face had lifted serene eyes upwards, even
as the faggots about her had began to
crackle. Since then there had been “fey”
women, running like a weird singing thread
through all the breed. And one evening Son
had found Agnes crying and shuddering in
the garden. “John has cursed us,” she said,
wildly. “There will be no happiness for
us, Son.” She thrust at the air as though
to push some tangible thing away. “Don't
you feel it? Heavy. .. .heavy... .the black,
black curse!”
The young husband carried her inside, and
put her on the bed, where she lay like some-
thing all the life has gone out of; a white
rose, drooping where someone has carelessly
broken the stem.
Mrs. Granger tried to reassure the boy,
when he came to her with the tale. “Tut,
laddie, only fancies,” she said, kindly. “They
all get them at this time. Keep her bright
and cheerful. That’s all she wants. Don’t
let her brood—or see you brood,” she added
shrewdly, for she fancied there were lines
on (( the boyish face never made by laughter.
“I’ve been selfish,” he said, curtly. “I
have been brooding, Auntie.” His mouth
quivered. “It has been a big blow, John’s
•attitude. Not that I haven’t deserved it, but
- And Agnes has watched it all, ’ and
she s got the idea that the fault is all hers.”
He flushed. “I’ve been a cur,” he added
lamely.
“Then go home, and be a very good bov
to her, ’ said his old friend.
That night, with her heart aching alike for
betrayer and betrayed, she faced John deter-
minedly.
“John,” she said, quietly; “do you knoiv
Agnes is going to have a baby?”
A quiver ran through John’s frame;
otherwise he did not move. “Well, I think,
Auntie, even you will concede it is no con-
cern of mine.”
“John,” she went on with a kind of
tense earnestness that carried more con-
viction than anything else could have done
—“John, I beg of you to think wdiat you
are doing. Son and Agnes sinned against
you, but Love has sinned before to-day.
They are only human. And, my dear—oh,
my dear—they are both too fine, and both
are loving you too well, to accept the hap-
piness they snatched at without suffering
poignantly. Their happiness depended on
you, and John, my dear, you are deliberately
wrecking it.”
The knuckles of John’s hands were like
polished ivory, but lie had no word at all
to answer her with.
She went on very deliberately. “Agnes
is making herself ill over it. Just now when
she needs to be at her brightest, not only
for her own sake but for the baby’s She is
fretting, growing morbid, blaming herself
alone for the breach between you and Son.
She says your love for each other was a
beautiful thing till she murdered it; that
you have cursed them, and they will have to
pay heavily for their sin. I’m telling you
all this, John, so that you may ask yourself
dare you carry on your campaign of hate.’’
“My God!” said John, in a rush of pas
sionate words. “Have you forgotten that
only a few months ago I dreamed of caring
for her, cherishing her, dreamed of children
coming to her—and me? It was going to be
my privilege to surround her with this lov-
ing care, and n0w....n0w” His face
worked, and his trembling lips refused fur-
ther speech.
Mrs. Granger laid her work-roughened
hand very gently on his head. “God help a
poor hurt laddie,” she whispered. And for
the first time she felt a faint gleam of
hope enter her saddened old heart. Here
was only a deep hurt; for the moment the
bitterness and the hatred had slipped out of
sight, and when that happened—why, she
knew that it was John’s dear, fine self com-
ing to life again.
With this hope new-arisen it was with
great reluctance that a few days later she,
accompanied by her husband, was forced to
take a journey up north to see a sister who
had been, they feared, fatally injured in an
accident. She watched John from the car-
riage window speeding their departure,
watched him with a wistfulness she could
not conceal. Her heart felt torn in the
struggle between the calling of two dear
ones. Thpre was, of course, no question but
that she should go to Anna, but she whis-
pered a plea that, if John should want help,
it would not be till she was back again, to
stand by him with her wealth of under-
standing love.
Almost a feeling of relief came to the man
at the old couple’s departure. He could
drink or brood as the mood took him with-
out encountering the wistful, gentle accusa-
tion of Aunty B.’s glance.
But lie got less and less pleasure from his
bouts of drinking. It did not, as before,
barb each thought with a point of hate.
There was always stirring a vague unrest
that nothing quite stilled.
One night lie woke, dazedly, dimly con-
scious of a voice calling.
“Eh?” he said, struggling to make his
brandy-dulled wits respond.
“John !”
That voice stripped him of befuddled
sleep instantly.
“Agnes!” he cried, flinging his door wide.
Agues dropped the little yellow-flamed
lantern to the floor. She began to speak
with a quick breathlessness that slid her
words one into the other in a childish way.
“Oh, John, I had to come! I was sleep-
ing and something awoke me—a Voice, so
clear, so insistent, that I had to come
for our forgiveness. The Voice used some-
times to speak to Granny, John, and oh, it
always spoke true, so—so I had to come,
John, dear.” She came close, with a gesture
of pleading. “If you can never forgive me,
forgive Son. Lay the blame of it all on me,
only forgive Son. He is away to-night, sit-
ting with old Ben Good, whom they think
will surely die before morning. John, dear,
you would forgive him if you only knew his
unhappiness.”
Scarcely a word penetrated the brain of
the man, afire with the nearness of her. Her
face was like a sleep-rosy child’s between the
two thick braids of her gold hair, beneath
her coat the hem of a pale-pink gown fell,
and her feet had been thrust bare into tiny
pink slippers.
Oh, God in Heaven, but this girl was de-
sirable, who had come to him in the dead
of night!
John put two hands heavily on her shoul-
ders. Only a few months ago he had con-
sidered it his right to draw this slender
figure to him, to crush that red mouth be-
neath the passion of his kisses. And now
his breath was coming quickly, his eyes were
glittering with suddenly-unleashed desire.
“Agnes,” lie said again.
But Agnes met that red look with a quiet,
steadfast one, full of sweet, certain courage.
John was John, and however they might
fail him, she knew John could never quite
fail them.
“You—you stir the child beneath my
heart, dear John,” she said, with a quiver
of her mouth.
The man’s hands dropped from her shoul-
ders. His face flushed a dull red, and all
the passion died out of his eyes
“Go home, Agnes,” he said harshly, swing-
ing away from her in the swift revulsion of
feeling that engulfed him. A very nausea of
Ins action, of the evil that had mastered
him for those few moments left him cold
and shivering.
Son’s wife! He would not look at her
again.
The starred window across at Plainways
caught liis eye.
“Go home, Agnes,” he said. “You have
left a light burning.”
Agnes was at his elbow, her faith in the
calling Voice still unshaken. “That is not
a lamp, John. That is the Star of Love.
Sonnie sets it there—for you. He said when
lie was a little boy he used to put a lamp
in the window for you when you were late
coming home. And oh, John, dear,” chok-
ingly, “he says this is the latest you’ve ever
been. He lit it the other night and stood
looking across at your home, John, and—
when he turned I —l saw tears on his face.
John, forgive him.”
The Star of Love!
All at once a cool, white wave of peace
stole through the wracked frame of John
Chester. It was as actual as the exquisite
relief afforded a tortured body by the injec-
tion of morphia.
Son had lit it all these nights. The
little chap he had nursed a thousand times
who had lisped baby prayers at his knees!
He knew now what was the spirit of un-
ceasing unrest in him. He was unutterably
lonely, longing for the sound of his brother's
voice, the touch of his hand.
The sombre shadow of months was lifted
from his face as he turned to the girl.
“Go home, little girl,” he said gently,
“and tell Son I have read the message of
the Star at last.”
