The New Immortality
Alas, beloved, would that now at was
As when young Milton tuned for Lycidas
His plaintive reed,
Yet knew his friend flown to the serene skies
With solemn troops and sweet societies;
He had no need
To ask, as now I ask, with wistful cheer,
Where art thou gone ? for I indeed
Have a specific thing to ask thee, dear,
And pine, unanswered ;
But I, on this extremest verge of time,
Know by the light of Myers and of Lodge
That thou art gone to no angelic clime,
But somewhere in the world dost creep and dodge
And hover like a homeless bird upon
The confines of our life in vain,
And seek’st with endless pain
To speak to me through some poor Yankee Jane
or John
Or Jeffreson G-. Gulp of Hartford (Conn.).
Would it were even, O my heart’s desire,
As when bright Shelley struck the innnortal lyre
Bor Keats deceased so young ;
For it is sung
That into Nature’s bosom he departed
And was a portion of that loveliness
Which once he made more lovely. Broken-
hearted
No longer should I be
If this were true of thee,
So that I need no longer pine and guess
Where in the world thou lingerest, sadly groping
Along blank, doorless walls, for ever hoping
Soon to find one ajar
Through which.thou may’st address me, tho’ afar,
And answer all my question and assuage
My poor heart’s rage.
But when I know thou art no part of Nature
But a, mere bodiless creature
Waiting for me, I needs must hanker
To know where finally thou choose to anchor :
Whether in Mister or in Miss
Or Mrs. Pegram of Milwaukee (Wis. j,
We lived and loved, and thou hast died, too late.
’Tis not so long, beloved, since the gate
Of Heaven was closed, and Nature ceased to be
The grand recipient and repository
Of suchi as Keats and thee.
The ’thirties, nay, the ’forties, yet had hope ;
For Hallam doors flew ope :
The poet saw him ranging with his peers,
No eavesdropping and whining spirit-tramp,
Ragged and damp,
Homeless and pinched, and fumbling at the gates
Of all. the mediutns of the United States.
Bdt he who now aspires
(So sayeth Myers)
To hold communion with the august dead
Must peep and dodge
(So saitli the unimaginable Lodge)
About the frowzy bed
Of Some neurotic and cacophohous ass—
Say Thumpacat P. Belch of Boston (Mass).
Thank goodness, found at last, my dear old pal
Through Mrs. Josh. G. Bunch of Stockton (Oal.)!
Where is it, blast you, now I have you fast—
The cellar key ? You know you had it last.

ARNOLD WALL.
A Remarkable Anthology
IT falls to the fortune of this reviewer
to bring to the notice of his readers
one of the most remarkable antholo-
gies of verse and prose ever issued. The
work seems to be a series of selections from
the writings of some bygone and fiercer
age. The romances are full of fighting
and vengeance and tribal gods, and the
poetry is vivid and passionately realistic
or dignified with the highest philosophic
thought. And the translations are ex-
cellently done.
The anthology is entitled The Literary
Man’s Bible, and the editor is W. L.
Courtney (Chapman & Hall).
The book from which these selections
are taken is, fortunately, easily obtain-
able ; but a glance at it confirms the
necessity for this selection. For the
Bible, read as history, is unpardonably
scrappy. Whole periods are missed out,
and without explanation ; and it would
be difficult for the general reader to
gather exactly the course of events with-
out extensive study. In his introductory
essay, Courtney explains exactly what
the Old Testament is.
We shall find that the two Books of
Chronicles constitute a literary forgery. We
shall find that the Book of Esther is an
almost shocking example of Jewish intoler-
ance and spite. We shall discover that the
Jews derived their ideas of cosmogony
mainly from. Babylonia, and that the laws of
Moses were largely indebted to the code of
Hammurabi. We shall become aware that
a great deal was put under the names of
David and Isaiah which neither of these two
eminent men could possibly have written,
and that, indeed, all the early documents of
the Hebrews were subjected to a series of
revisions which in many cases conceal and
distort their original meaning.
What'happened was this. The Old Test-
ament is largely the manufacture of
priestly writers during and after the
Babylonian exile. And in this revised
edition earlier elements were incorpor-
ated by the priestly editors. For the He-
brews in the course of their career had
four different phases of religion, or, more
probably, four different religions.
«
The origin of the race is to be found
in Northern Arabia, where the earliest
faith was clearly a nomad religion, and
the name of their god was Jahveh. These
nomads, on entering the Land of Canaan,
incorporated into their religion alien
elements from the Canaanite peoples.
Jahveh is still their tribal god, but Baal
and Ishtar (Astarte), and others are
admitted as rival deities. The third
stage is the religion of the Prophets.'
This in one sense was a return to the nomad
faith ; in another sense it was the most
idealistic religion that had hitherto been
conceived. J ahveh is no longer the tribal
god: he is the god of the whole earth,
and all his supposed rivals are either
devils or non-existent. But this was too
rarefied an atmosphere for the priestly
class to breathe; and the next stage is
a priestly religion, engineered by men like
Ezra, who believed that the Sabbath was
a prime article of their faith. “ The Sab-
bath, of course, was either originally a
new moon festival or borrowed from
Babylon, and it had nothing whatsoever
to do with the so-called Day of Rest,
carefully written into the earliest chap-
ters of Genesis by the priestly revisers.”
Those early editors knew their business,
v)/
Indeed, the Bible has been compiled from
many strata of narrative, forcibly welded
together by its successive editors. There
is in it a difference of style, some-
times a difference in language. And
the presence of different hands is shown
in the numerous repetitions, and, for ex-
ample, in the two somewhat contradic-
tory versions of the Creation. There are
also in places distinctly different points
of view. And the faiths of Israel were
continually developing, and what was con-
sistent with one phase was not necessarily
consistent with |he next. So it was con-
tinually necessary to keep the book
up to date. It was a kind of Year-Book,
a history of the world re-written from
century to century, and always kept
up to date. There were four chief strata.
The first, the Jahvistic writer, has a
picturesque style. In Courtney’s opinion
he is, above all, the literary artist. The
next editor, the Elohistic journalist, has
not such a fine literary style, and is also
biassed in favor of the Ephraimites and
the Northern kingdom. His successor,
the priestly editor, is quite stereotyped
in expression, with a constant pre-
occupation for the ordinances of the
Law. The Story of Joseph, as it stands
in the Bible, is a compilation by a late
editor of two accounts, written respect-
ively by the Jahvist and the Eloist
journalists. The latest editor compiled
his yarn by taking passages alternately
from the first two journalists, and har-
monising them as best he could.
W
And even then, the contents of this
book are not always original. They are
frequently borrowed from Babylon. Thus
the story of Moses in the bulrushes—
quite a romantic story—is the story of a
Babylonian king ; while, as Courtney
tells us,
The Hebrew story of the Creation in the
first chapter of Genesis is derived from a
Babylonian creation epic, written upon seven
tablets and discovered in 1872 by G. Smith,
in the library of Assurbanipal at Nineveh,
the exploits of Marduk, the supreme god of
Babylon, being transferred to the God of
Israel.
The sensational novel of Noah’s flopd
was also found written on tablets in the
same library. The story was transplanted
to Palestine, but unfortunately it was
forgotten that the local conditions in
Babylonia and in Canaan were quite
different, so that the account given in
Genesis is now declared to be scientifi-
cally impossible. Of course, the Assyrian
civilisation was immensely older than
the Jewish.
In The Rise of the Greek Epic,
that intensely interesting book by our
brilliant Australian, Gilbert Murray,
of Oxford, now recognised by the world
as one of the foremost of Greek scholars,
and the author of the best modem trans-
lations of the Greek tragedies, this mat-
ter is treated with illuminating detail.
The Old Testament, as we have it, was
revised and revised until, about 400 8.C.,
it was brought, roughly speaking, into its
present shape. Murray remarks ;
In an average chapter of Genesis we may
read a verse written in the ninth century
B.C. followed by one written in the fifth, a
gap of four hundred years. And sometimes
the gap will occur in the middle of a verse.
And Murray also points out that these
earlier books were not written out of
nothing. The Biblical editors sometimes
admit their sources by name. For in
stance, there is the Book of the Wars of
the Lord, and the Book of Jasher.
Somehow, we yearn for that lost Book
of Jasher. But, more often, following
the example of the disreputable press,
the source of the information is not
disclosed. Is it to be wondered at that
the book is full of inconsistencies and
contradictions 1 A special example is
the case of the Twelve Tribes of Israel,
which are mentioned again and again as
twelve, yet always add up as thirteen,
vt/
As for the anthology, the curious
reader can find here idyllic and pictur-
esque stories like The Wooing of RebekaJ, :
poetry like The Song of Deborah ; popular
fables like The Parable of the Trees; pas-
toral idylls like liuth; picturesque
episodes like Davicl and Jonathan, fierce
little songs of vengeance, such as Lamech’s
Song, dating from the time when the
Jews were nothing more than Arabian Be-
douins ; acrostics—chapters the verses
of which begin with the letters of the
Hebrew alphabet; pessimistic philo-
sophy, with a touch of Omar Khayyam,
or Euripides, as in Ecclesiastes, which was
included in the Canon, only because it
was wrongly attributed to Solomon; a
great example of wisdom-literature, Job
(recently commended in this page);
and that remarkable erotic song, The
Song of Solomon, which was not written
by Solomon, But which may possibly- be
an epithalamium, or the fragments of a
drama, awkwardly patched together by a
late editor. This, alone, is worth the
price of the book.
The Australian View.
In From the Old Log (being the letters
on politics of the Hon. —, ex-Prime
Minister, to his nephew—2s. fid., T. C.
Lothian, Melb.) Frank Fox talks straight
Australian upon Australian subjects. The
letters are not brilliant, nor are they dull ;
but for a careful summing up of the Austra-
lian point of view they are of historical and
national value. Fox treats such subjects as
The “ Good ” Man in Politics, Titles, Econo-
my, The Australian Type, A White Austra-
lia, Flag Flapping, Food Fads, Socialism,
The Woman Question, The Fiscal Issue,
Defence, and other Australian subjects from
a common-sense standpoint, and his conclu-
sions, Bulletin-esque and speckled with split
infinitives, are those with which his country-
men will be in complete accordance. The
book is printed on Australian-made paper,
though—not yet, alack ! from; Australian-
made type. As a summing up of the
national view it deserves a wide public.
Especially to be praised is Fox’s delightful
essay upon the Australian Type.
In his treatment of ‘ ‘ Being Local and
Narrow,” the author overstates his case;
and his special pleading does not convince.
He dismisses the advantages of foreign
travel with the phrases that ‘ ■ The travelled
Australian may gain some polish. It is in-
evitable that in many cases he will lose some
sturdiness.” On the contrary, there are
innumerable instances to prove that if a
man is a good Australian, his visit abroad
will bring him back a better Australian.
Travel means education, a broader view, a
basis for his opinions. Australian artists
and pressmen, for instance, living in Lon-
don are more sturdy Australians because of
their exile. And the returned Australian is
a finer Australian, worth more to his coun-
try by his wider view. The Australian
who is seduced from Australianism by
his visit to London does not return;
and the loss of de-Australianised Australians
is a gain to us who are left. In England,
one has only to compare the travelled
Englishman with the untravelled Little
Englander to appreciate the value of travel.
An Australian can talk to a travelled Eng-
lander ; both have a basis for argument; the
untravelled Englander and the untravelled
Australian have none. There are plenty of
returned Oxford graduates in Australia who
are more sturdy Australians than when they
left. They have seen England.
A few of the author’s opinions :
“ Politics is gallantry played on a bigger
scale.
“The Englishman boasts that he does not
know when he is beaten ; and very often he
does not know when to come in out of the
wet.
“ The spirit of cheerfulness and holiday-
making is a more sound and wholesome basis
for a great nation than any other. England
was greatest, intellectually and otherwise,
when England was merriest, and the
standard of its power drooped with the
advent of sordid commercialism and gloomy
Calvinism. All the great enduring work of
the world has been done with an air of
gaiety ; there has never been a gloomy
BenaisSance. . . . Life is, to some large
extent, an end, and not merely an instru-
ment to be worn out in accomplishing a
sordid purpose. . . . Purityranny in Aus-
tralia fights against the forces of Nature,
against the almost perpetual cheerfulness of
the Australian sunlight.
‘ ‘ Democracy is a purely Caucasian pro-
duct; other branches of the human race
have at times developed theocracies, social-
isms,, and communisms among their despot-
isms, but never aAemocracy. . . . Democracy,
without understanding quite why, is im-
pelled by its instinct of self-preservation to
antagonism towards peoples who have, as far
as the memory of man stretches back, been
ever servile in spirit.”
'■'"fib < ' ——-„
Winifred James’ Bachelor Betty is to have
the hall-mark of success. Constable’s is
issuing; the Australian girl’s book in six-
penny form. But what does the publishing
firm mean when it states that “Miss Wini-
fred James has once for all removed the
charge of literary barrenness so far as Aus-
tralia is concerned
“Why don’t our earnest Protectionists
get a move on in affording some revenue-
producing protection to native verse ? ” asks
• “-D.M.-W.” “ I don’t say shut out the
English or American product, but let all the
Australasian magazines and jqurnals that 1
love to fill a jingling corner with pirated
rime pay for the privilege. I suggest, for a
start, a tax of two-and-sixpence a word on all
foreign-grown verse less than fifty years old
printed in any publication in the Common-
wealth or Maoriland. On older verse the
tax would be sixpence a line, while Shake-
speare might be admitted free if guaranteed
unadulterated and free from printers’ errors.
The first result of the protection would be a
reduction in tlie consumption of verse, but
very soon the public would miss the accus-
tomed jingles, and a strong demand would
set jn for the local article. Fraudulent imi-
tations should be punished with imprison-
ment, and the making of false labels and
trade-marks should be a capital offence. At
last a time might arrive when the poet
would have at least as good a chance of
making a livelihood out of his work as an
artist or a washerwoman. Is there any
reason why soap should have more protection
than soul, or candles than the lightning flash
of inspiration ? ”
[Why confine the new protection to verse ?
Maoriland is speckled all over with the
cheap-labor, syndicated serial and the stolen
rime ; and Australia is also badly infected
with the disease.]

1111 Longevity —l9Ol
Famous Centenarians.
Length of years is commoner than of old —centenarians are
on the increase. This is partly due to greater enlightenment in
matters of hygiene, but not a little to those famous centenarians,
Cockle’s Antibilious Pills, which have been regularly prescribed
by the medical profession since the year 1801. Truly a glorious
record! They are simply unrivalled as a remedy for all dis-
orders of the liver, stomach and bowels.

“My little son, Norman, aged
eight months, was very ill with
a cold on the lungs, and the
doctor advised
me to use
SCOTT’S
Emulsion,
saying that
if SCOTT’S
did not do
him good,
nothing
would. Less
than half a
bottle cured
him and he
is now a
fine healthy
boy.”

h
NORMAN BOUGHKN
(Mrs.) ]. Boughen.
Rosewood, via Ipswich, Queensland. 21/5/07.
Above is the Proof in the Facts.
Here is Proof in the Reason Why:
The doctor ordered SCOTT’S because
SCOTT’S is the standard cod liver oil
emulsion. SCOTT’S is also the original
emulsion which has been widely recom-
mended by doctors for 32 years past. In
addition to this, every season brings a
great budget of letters quite as enthusias-
tic as the one printed above. There is a
reason for this, and it is that no pains are
ever spared to procure the finest possible
materials for manufacture by the original
perfected SCOTT process, which has never
yet been equalled. Therefore, when pur-
chasing, don’t ask for “ Emulsion; ” ask for
and get SCOTT’S Emulsion—the differ-
ence between them means a cure for you!

Darncin’.
This darncin’s gittin’ on my nerves. You see
Johanner,
That woman m the pink, with elbow gloves ?
The little wretch, she’s clutchin’ that goanner
As if he was the bloke as wot she loves.
She’s nestled up so snug—jes’ see her smilin’
Like bloomin’ sunrise, list’nin’ to his rot;
And me a-nussin’ Em’ly—ain’t it rilin’ ?
And she a-wantin’ drink as like as not.
I never darnces —see that bloomin’ draper
A-goin’ over whisp’rin’ in her yere !
Engagin’ for the next —I know his caper.
“Johanner, hurry up, I’m waitin’ here !”
It’s'mighty queer—l’d like to see that joker
Come down and hug my missus at the ’ouse !
I’d spread him quick ’n’ lively with the poker.
But —here I sits and sees it, like a mouse.
I’ll waltz her round—you, Em’ly, stop yer
squealin’;
I’ll squeeze yer waist, Johanner, more sincere.
I’ll teach you who’s yer ’usband when yer swingin
Across them hills a-goin’ ’ome, my dear !

THE PROOSHAN.
Attic Land.
Up in Attic Land the roar
Of the street disturbs no more.
Not an under-dweller knows
Half the joy of true repose.
’Tis a land of mystery.
Myriad.roof-tops dazzle me;
In the maze of human hives
Shelter tired and broken lives.
Opposite, a wistful-eyed
Parlor-maid contrives to hide
From distracting kitchen sounds
And rough hawkers on their rounds.
Oft she sits in her chemise,
Knowing no street-dweller sees ;
Only I and star-gods glimpse
Flowing hair and girlish limbs.
Waitress at a boarding-house,—
O, you harried little mouse,
How sublime a rest would be !
Better come and starve with me.
I am neither rich nor proud,
But I hate the curious crowd ;
I can only offer you
Bread and cheese and kisses true.
You will darn my hopeless socks,
I will buy you cotton frocks;
Lest you pine for silk and gems,
Love shall weave you diadems.
You, perhaps, earn better fare,
Gayer garments over there,
But your beating heart is maimed
And your woman’s pride is shamed.
You shall lie a-bed, my sweet,
Soothe your tired little feet,
Sleep or wake till longings seem
Woven with the gems of dream.
Lie beside the bit of blue,
Curtamless, three feet by two,
Hear the birds and watch the sun
And the stars pass, one by one.
You are weary of the earth,
I will nurse you back to mirth ;
Every morn when you awake,
Now it seems your heart must break 1
You will love to flaunt the hours’
Busy chimes from city-towers ;
Never more shall screaming bell
Gall you down into that hell.
Heaven never meant you slave
For a shrewish lodging-knave;
Little mouse, an’ you’d be free,
Come across and starve with me !
N.S.W.
W. M. WHITNEY.
A Leap Year Leap.
They occupied Gumm’s boarding house,
And she was tall, and thin, and grim,
But he was timid as a mouse.
The maid a dead-set made at him.
She tracked him down what fearful way
The hungry lion tracks his prey,
With little fuss—
Insidious !
He stole about in secret nooks,
In corners dark he hid by night.
He seemed to live on tenter-hooks,
And daily grew more sad and white.
He could not run—he owed, ’tis said,
For washing, mending, board and bed
A goodly sum
To Mrs. Gumm.
One day the maiden tracked him where
A beetling cliff o’erhung the sea.
“ You know,” she said, “it is Leap year.”
“ Leap year !” he gasped. Intently he
Looked in her hungry eye, arose,
And cried : “ Leap year it is. Here goes ! ”
One tear he wept,
And then he leapt !

Eight Million F eet of
Lumber Used for Pack-

MORE than eight million feet of lumber were
required last year to make boxes for
shipping Sherwin-Williams Paint and
Varnish Products into all parts of the civilised world. As boxes are used only
for small packages this does not represent the large amount of goods put up in barrels, half-
barrels, kegs, etc.. This enormous demand for Sherwin-Williams Products is the result of
their exceptional quality. No other paint and varnish products are made that
are the equal of Sherwin-Williams. Each product in the line is the very best
for its purpose that human ingenuity can produce. That is why they always
give such good satisfaction and have such a great demand.
When you have need for Paint or Varnish in your
Home, Shop or Factory, or anything in them, ask
your dealer for Sherwin-Williams.

THE WILDERNESS AND THE GREAT
LANDLORD.
There have recently appeared in Victoria, which
among the mainland States is the horrible example
of the evil of big landlordism, some curious
figures re the growth of population on those pre-
mises. At last census (taken in 1901) Victoria
had 1,201,341 people; at the end of 1907 it was
estimated to have 1,258,140. That represented
an increase of 56,799, which couldn’t be called
much of an increase—it meant that the birth-rate
was only moderate; that the net immigration was
nil ; and that the net emigration was considerable,
not to say awful. And when account is taken
of the distribution of the 56,799 souls who formed
the poor little increase above referred to, the
reason why they were so very few becomes glaringly
evident. This is the condensed record of 6f
years, if the estimates are anywhere near correct:
Increase of
Population.
Melbourne .. . •• 41,921
Bendigo, Geelong, Castlemaine, Warr-
nambool, and Maryborough .. .. 5,85 b
All the rest of Victoria 9 ' u -^
56,799
The figures are sufficiently remarkable to indict
the Rich Landlord before the court of the nation
as a public enemy—a worse enemy than any that
Australia has, or is ever likely to have, outside ;
and to condemn him to be hanged by the neck to
anything that is high enough to keep his feet off
the ground, and left there until he ceases to be of
any importance.
Plainly, Protection is doing what it can for Vic-
toria. It is helping the manufacturing city of Mel-
bourne to keep its head above water; if
it were not for the growth of Melbourne
there would be practically no increase of popula-
tion in Victoria at all. But the smaller towns,
which depend to a great extent on the busi-
ness of supplying the adjacent population
with food, drink, clothes and miscellaneous
stores, progress very slowly because in so many
cases there is practically no adjacent population ;
and the rural districts are dead. They have Pro-
tection certainly. Also, in many cases, they have
railways that are quite unprofitable because they
run through wastes and wildernesses where a
human being is almost as rare as a revolution, and
the city workers pay to make up the loss on these
railways. Also they have amazingly cheap
freights. They are almost free of local rates;
that is to say, they pay Is. in the £ on a valuation
that is 50 or 75 per cent, below the real one, which
makes the alleged Is. really 6d. or 3d. in the £,
while the city dweller pays as much as 2s. Gd. in
the £. They have grants from the general
treasury for roads, bridges and sundries, and
their irrigation works have, by a vast pro-
cess of fraud and swindle, been supplied
mostly at the city dweller’s expense. They
are supplied with cheap money by the State
Land Bank ; and they are allowed to employ cheap
labor or unpaid child labor to a degree unheard of in
the city. But all these advantages fail to create a
rural population of any importance, for all these
things are brought to naught by the g> eat landlord,
who in some cases will neither sell nor let the soil,
while in others he will sell at about five times the
fair value of the land, or let at about five times
the fair rental. The big landlord has been al-
lowed to capitalise all the privileges above
enumerated —the grants from the Treasury, the
value of the railways and the cheap freights, the
infinitesimal local rates, the gratis irrigation
works, the benefits of the State Land Bank, and
all the rest—and to add them on to the valuation
of the land. These privileges, instead of helping
the genuine settler, have made land absurdly
dear ; and the landlords’ tacit conspiracy against
the sale of land has added another 100 per cent, or
more to the paper value of the soil by the mere
creation of artificial scarcity. There is more hope
for the future and more profit for the present in
taking a job in a boot factory in Collingwood than
in making an attempt to start farming under exist-
ing conditions. Therefore, those young men who
can get a job in a Collingwood boot factory take
it, and the others clear out of the State to look
for some place where the future isn’t entirely a
blank.
* * * *
The increase of 9022 people, which has taken
place in Victoria —outside Melbourne and the
other five towns enumerated —in 6£ years, isn’t
even as good as it seems. It doesn’t represent in-
crease in the agricultural population at all. There
are in Victoria about 30 towns of fair importance in
addition to the comparatively big centres already
mentioned, and it is quite probable that their in-
crease accounts for the whole of the 9022 people.
In that case the bucolic population has been
either stationary or actually diminishing; the
chances are that it has been diminishing.
Yet during the last few years the Govern-
ment has made tremendous efforts to create
new agricultural population by every de-
vice except that of clearing out the one
stupendous evil, the great landlord. It has
built 160 miles of new railway to carry people to
the land they can’t get, and to fetch away the
non-existent produce of the farmers who aren’t
there. It has shoved settlers out in an earnest
fashion on the few little bits of State land that
remain—the dry wastes of the Mallee and the
rocky, sodden mountain tops of Gippsland. It
has (nominally) settled quite a horde of people in
these places. It has also spent a heap of money
on the purchase (at exorbitant prices) of a few
estates, on which, by reason of the exorbitant
prices, settlement has proved almost impossible. '
Adolphus Bent has almost died in his motor-car
of heat, worry and old age while rushing around
looking for land. And as his land policy has cer-
tainly settled some few people in Gippsland and
in the Mallee, the only possible inference is that
in the great, rich Western District, the garden of
Victoria, where the big landlord is supreme, the
human race is dying out. The awful net result is
that, after Bent has run and roared himself almost
to death in pursuit of settlement, Victoria had, in
1907, about 86,000 acres less under cultivation than
in 1904. That sort of thing isn’t settlement.
* * * *
It is good sometimes to have a helot—a drunken
helot —on the premises as a warning, but it isn’t
good to have the helot on the premises too long,
or to have him too drunk ; and there is always a
chance that the helot, instead of serving as a
warning, may lead the rest of the community into
dissipated habits. Victoria and Tasmania have
their uses in the Federal scheme of things ; they
are shocking examples of the evils of great estates,
and of the brutish selfishness of the landlord class,
and they point the way in which the rest of Aus-
tralia ought not to go. It is to its great landlords
that Victoria owes its comparatively unimportant
position in the Commonwealth; because they
won’t allow population to grow in the country
districts, the State represents a steadily de-
creasing proportion of Australia s population
and is a decreasing influence in Australian
politics. The defencelessness of Australia is
to them so far as their influence reaches ;
and, °so far as their influence extends, they are
also’responsible for the comparative defenceless-
ness of the Empire. They are the enemies of
marriage and the marriage-tie, for their greed
drives the young men out of the State to look for
new homes, and the departure of the young men
leaves the Victorian girls behind to be lingering
remnants and old maids. Consequently it isn t
surprising to find that, at last census, Victoria,
despite its smaller population, had thousands
more unmarried women of marriageable age than
N.S.W. possessed. The great landlord is the
enemy of the birth-rate, because his policy pre-
vents marriage, and he is thereby the slayer of
unborn children ; and if that doesn t classify him
as the enemy of God, then there is something
amiss with theology. After all, Herod s massacre
of the children at Bethlehem was not a
more disreputable act than the murder of the un-
born which is committed daily by these earth-
monopolists who, out of their own sordid greed,
make marriage impossible. The Victorian land-
owners by prohibiting settlement, have already
obliterated a fair-sized nation that might
have been, and that is a record in its
way. Judging by the population figures
of “the last six years, it seems a fair estimate
that they have destroyed more population
(or possible population) than did the 1 ranco-
German war j and that they have been ten times
more destructive (and consequently more wicked)
than the massacre of Saint Bartholomew ; and
that in the way of making an empty wilderness
where there was (or might have been) population,
the Turk in Macedonia is a small circumstance
compared with the big land-grabber in Victoria.
And the land-grabber has been an active as well
as a passive curse. Every miserable, enslaved
kiddy who spends his miserable childhood in pur-
suit of the muddy deity Cow, because the
exactions of the landlord make the hiring of adult
labor almost impossible, is another anathema on
the landlord’s head. And every unhappy infant
that dies in the breathless slums of Collingwood,
because the locking up of the county lands has
driven his parents to the city is another corpse on
the big landlord’s doorstep. It may be a very
small corpse, but when the baby corpses are
heaped up they make a very awkward pile to
climb over on the road to Heaven. But perhaps
the average great landlord has given up all idea of
getting to Heaven. He certainly ought to.
„ * * *
The Bulletin holds up the case of Victoria
(and incidentally that of Tasmania), not because
Victoria or Tasmania matters a cent more than
any other State, but as a warning. Victoria has
fourteen people to the square mile ; Tasmania has
seven. They have both got to that point at
which, by reason of the curse of the great land-
grabber, there is no room for increase of popula-
tion except in the towns and cities. Unless the
public enemy is wiped out, these States can
grow nothing now save streets and slums.
Allowing for the fact that a lot of N.S.W.
is drought country, that State, unless it
deals drastically with the great landlord curse,
will probably reach the same condition of paralysis
when its population attains to about 2,000,000.
Queensland will strike the limit of utter hopeless-
ness a little later. South Australia, being largely
desert, seems to have almost reached its limit
already. The entire future of Australia depends
on the destruction of the great land monopolist
who prohibits population—the kind of person who
causes inhabited dwellings on fertile Monaro to be
20 or 25 miles apart, and who reckons that it is a
fair thing for one man to own 300,000 acres outside
Bibbenluke, and to keep that splendid principality
for the grazing of a few sheep. The Australian
Parliament is the only power that can adequately
deal with this evil, and it should make the gradu-
ated land-tax for the breaking up of big estates a
front-row item of its programme. Even such a
matter as the defence of Australia is no more
important than this, for unless the great estates
are broken up there will be no Australia worth
speaking of to defend and very few folk to defend
it, The big landlord blots out armies faster and
more completely than they are wiped out in a lost
campaign. On Monaro in N.S.W. and in the
Western District of Victoria, both of which are
now practically empty, there might have been to-
day the material for a fighting force of 300,000
men, save for the landlord, who has, out of
wickedness, avarice, vanity and malice afore-
thought, made these places a howling emptiness.
That loss equals the cost in men of both parties in
the Eranco-German war, and there isn’t even a
streak of questionable glory to show for it.
PLAIN ENGLISH-
The Compound Interest Joke.
Maoriland is the dreadful example, so far as
Australasia is concerned, in the borrowing in-
dustry these days. Its debt liability, according
to some recent calculations, exceeds tlie estimated
value of all the assets owned by the Government,
which is a condition of things that even the
wildest State this side of the Tasman Sea hasn’t
quite arrived at. And whereas nowadays the
Australian public borrower is ashamed and surrep-
titious, and pleads necessity, and professes to be
going to swear off as soon as possible, the Maoriland
loan-monger still seems to regard debt as almost
a virtue. The massive interest bill of Joseph
Ward’s State is now up to £2,593,557 per annum;
so even when the country raises £2,000,000 from
Burl in a single year, it has to leave all the money
in London to pay interest with, and send away
nearly £600,000 more to make up the rest of the
interest. The glory of the loan policy has
departed when things come to this point, and
only the bones and the misery and the repentance
remain, but Maoriland apparently doesn’t begin
to see the point even now. When a country sets
out to borrow a steady average of (say) £2,000,000 a
year at (say) 3| per cent., its record goes some-
thing like this: —
Available
Received Paid in for Public
in Loans. Interest. Drunk.
Ist year .. £2,000,000 £70,000 £1,930,000
10th .. 2,000,000 700,000 1,300,000
20th ” .. 2,000,000 1,400,000 600,000
” (Drunk ended)
Dead loss.
30th „ .. 2,000,000 2,100,000 100,000
40th „ .. 2,000,000 2,800,000 800,000
So by that time the country owes £80,000,000, and
it is getting £2,000,000 a year further into debt;
and not only do its new borrowings give it not a
copper to spend, but it has to feel in its pocket for
£BOO,OOO of its own earnings this year, and
£870,000 next year, and £940,000 the year after,
and £1,010,000 the year after that to satisfy the
cormorant to which it has sold itself. The loan
policy means about 10 years of razzle, and 10
more of modified razzle, and after that 9J years
of hardly any razzle at all, and then a dead
brokeness, which increases and grows deader
and more broke every year, till the end is smash.
To explain more clearly how the drunk fades, let
the state of the country which borrows an average
of £2,000,000 a year a,t 3| per cent, be considered
again in ten-year periods : Balance
Received Paid in Available for
in Loans. Interest. Public Drunk.
Ist ten years .. £20,000,000 £3,850,000 £16,150,000
2nd . 20,000,000 10,850,000 9,150,000
3rd .. 20,000,000 17,850,000 2,150,000
(Nothing Avail-
able for
Public Drunk.)
Dead Loss.
4th „ .. 20,000,000 24,850,000 4,850,000
That is really putting far too good an appearance
on the case, for it takes no account of dis-
counts and expenses in the raising of loans,
charges on remittance of principal and interest,
and other sundries. These would probably come
to another £5,000,000. But apart from these
items the situation is that in 40 years the
country has raised £80,000,000 in loans and has
received, nominally, a balance of £22,600,000
—that is to say, it has had £22,600,000 net to
spend on works as a reward for incurring
a liability of £80,000,000. Probably, when
all the discounts and expenses are allowed
for, the real result of 40 years’ borrowing is
that the country has accumulated a debt or
£BO 000,000, and has had only £18,000,000 to spend
on works. Of course, things get worsejas the process
continues—if the borrowing craze went on tor bU
years on the same scale, the country, at the end or
that time, would have incurred a debt of
£120,000,000, and out of it would have received
(net) not a single copper—in fact, it would have
received £8,000,000 less than nothing, or, if dis-
counts and expenses are allowed for, it would
probably have received £15,000,000 less than
nothing. That is to say, it would have paid
£135,000,000 for the joy and privilege of owing
£120,000,000, and, after paying the £135,000,000,
it would still owe the £120,000,000. Compound
interest is a really humorous animal when care-
fully considered. Even the maddest monkey that
ever gambolled in a treetop is a serious creature
by comparison.

The Sydney tramway strike is now a thing of the
past. The overworked cab-horse has got back to
his regular hours ; the old musty Noah’s-Arkibus,
which had been dug out of its ancient retirement
and set to earning fares again, has gone back to
its dusty house of dreams ; and the indignant Eat
Man has calmed down. It was a drawn battle
after all, and the daily paper’s whoop of victory
was to a great extent unjustified and uncalled for.
So far as The Bulletin can see, the men would
have lost if the struggle had gone on ; but it didn’t
go on. Tram-driving is not highly-skilled labor,
and tram-conducting is almost wholly unskilled
labor, and there are only three ways in which a
strike of unskilled labor can hope to win. It must
be a strike of practically all the unskilled labor of
the community, and it must be able, by sheer force
of numbers, to make successful blacklegging im-
possible ; or it must be backed by a strike of
skilled labor ; or it must be run on the principles
of an old-time South American revolution, and
the strikers must scare intending applicants for
their billets off with guns. In the absence of all
these elements the Sydney tramway strike had no
real show. But, all the same, it ended in a
friendly compromise instead of unconditional
surrender. Railway Commisioner Johnson held
out the olive branch (large size). In fact, he held
out the whole tree. He promised to endeavor to
find a less offensive substitute for the present spy
system—the system about which the trouble
centred. He promised that the men would be
immediately reinstated, so far as possible, and he
clearly implied that it would be possible in the
great majority of cases. As regards the ring-
leaders, who were supposed to be beyond pardon,
he promised, with the olive-branch sticking con-
spicuously out of his mouth, that he would per-
sonally consider their cases—in other words, that
the matter would not be left to the man who in-
vented the private detective system. The bottom
fell out of the strike right there, and the hatchet
was buried, but it was Johnson who dug the hole.
And it was a decent act on the part of Johnson.
“ Please, Mr. Nivison.”
At the moment the Sydney Stock Exchange was
voting 100 guineas to reward certain men who
hadn’t been “loyal ” to other men in the same line
of business, S. Aus. was finding out what a
Buckley’s chance there is of getting the London
stockbrokers to be disloyal to their own
crowd. In the hope of saving a bit in under-
writing commission and brokerage, S. Aus., having
an I O IT falling due, fixed up things with Elder,
Smith and 00., of Adelaide, to get £2,000,000
from Lloyd’s Bank, in London —a vast concern
with a paid capital of nearly £4,000,000 and re-
serves of £3,000,000. But somebody talked too soon,
and then the London brokers—led by Nivison’s,
the firm that practically bosses Australian and
S’African loan issues—went on strike. Evidently
it intimated to Lloyd’s that if the latter took up
the loan it would be left on the bank’s hands—
the brokers wouldn’t touch it. Lloyd’s offered
to let Nivison’s stand in; but Nivison’s wasn’t
taking any standing in. The bank looked
round, evidently saw that the situation was hope-
less, and the whole business fell through. Now,
therefore, since the State simply must raise the
money—it hasn’t any alternative, because
the old I O U is at the door of the
fowlshed, and will come in to roost in
a few weeks —it will have to go to Nivison’s.
Theoretically, of course, it can go to any other
broker; but the London broking business is special-
ised, and for all practical purposes a “colonial
loan that needs underwriting must be taken toNivi-
son’s. And Nivison’s, now that it has crushed
out all possible opposition, isn’t likely to make
things nice and pleasant for either S. Australia or
any other Commonwealth State; wherefore, the
chances are that the strike of London brokers will
cost Australia a good many tens of thousands
more than the strike of Sydney tram-drivers
cost N. S. Wales. As something of aside-issue,
S. Australia’s Agent-General Jenkins resigned
while the trouble was on the boil. What caused
Jenkins to throw up his steady job at £l2OO
a year isn’t clear, so far. On the face of it it looks
as though Jenkins didn’t approve of the Govern-
ment’s idea for doing without Nivison, or didn’t
hustle for Lloyd’s 1 signature as hard as he used to
hustle for signatures in his book-canvassing days.
Anyhow, Jenkins did resign, and left office so
promptly that the chief clerk is now holding up
a. Australia’s burden in the land where Australia
can’t apparently borrow money without saying
“ Please, Mr. Nivison.”
Private Enterprise and a Cup of Water,
“ Victorian influence ” is one of the nightmares
of the little State-frighters of Sydney ; but the
same little State-frighters don’t seem to mind it a
bit as long as its object isn’t to advance the Com-
monwealth. So long as “ Victorian influence ” is
used to advance the interests of Victorian syndi-
cate sharks and Private Enterprise cormorants,
for instance, the Sydney State-frighters—includ-
ing Wade and his Government—appear to be
quite willing to oblige. There is only one con-
siderable town in N. S. Wales which depends for
its water supply upon Private Enterprise; and
that town is Broken Hill, which wants more
water than most places, partly because-it is in a
dry and dustv wilderness, and partly because its
one industry depends upon a water suppjy. But
Broken Hill happens to be hundreds of miles from
Sydney, and within 30 miles of the S. Australian
border ; that is to say, Sydney, the home of the
State-frighter, is on one edge of Is.b.W., and
Broken Hill is on the opposite edge, and there is
no direct rail connection between them. Conse-
auently when, years ago, Broken Hill cried for a
water-supply for its 30,000 or 40,000 people and
its great industry, Sydney took no notice what-
ever Then the Victorian syndicate pushed its
claws in, and, coming to Sydney, got Parliament
to give it the right to supply this patch of N. S.
Wales with water for 28 years At the end of
that time the State was to have the works free of
cost The syndicate knew what it was about. It
knew that the reservoir would be very largely
silted up at the end of 28 years, and would be by
then a shallow lagoon, and therefore practically
: useless in a region where the evaporation runs to
about 10ft. in the year. Yet, on th* strength


of having only a 28-years’ life, the co. was
empowered to charge (and has charged) such an
exorbitant price that Broken Hill has been forced
into the habit of washing itself in a pint of water.
Gradually, the reservoir has silted up—as all dams
do in that sandy, dusty wilderness—wherefore
Broken Hill lives now on the verge of a water-
famine, and once, at least, during the last few years
the famine actually arrived. When that happened
the mines had to shut down, the mining industry
was stopped, and life was only kept in the people
because water was carted up by train from S.
Aus., a couple of hundred miles. As Broken Hill
and its industry—an industry that means about
£3,000,000 a year to Australia—were seriously im-
perilled, the Government was appealed to. It
would do nothing. Then a Trust was formed by
a combination of town and mine interests. A
supplementary water supply would cost about
£200,000 or £250,000. The parties hoped to put
up that money ; but metals slumped, and the
mining cos.’ finances were for the moment dis-
organised. They, however, undertook to put up
half the money, and they begged the Wade
Government to find, say £lOO,OOO. Then Wade’s
own Works Minister, Lee, visited the site, and
approved of it, and said that the town and the
industry “ without a permanent water supply
would be paralysed.” Meantime, however, the
Victorian syndicate had been at work pulling the
strings. (Swinburne, the Victorian gasman, who
Was one of the Victorian spokesmen at the
State Premiers’ Conference, and gave Wade
so much support in the anti-Australian in-
terest, is the chairman of the Victorian syndi-
cate which makes hog-fat dividends by supplying
Broken Hill with a drink.) And, after the strings
had been pulled in the interests of the Victorian
syndicate, which has Swinburne for a chairman,
Wade announced that the State wouldn’t put up
any money. A town and an industry worth
£3,000,000 a year to Australia might be, as Lee
said, “paralysed,” but Wade wasn’t going to do
anything which might cut into the profits of
Swinburne and the other Victorian dividend-
grabbers. It is not even faintly suggested that
further works are unnecessary ; all that is sug-
gested is that Swinburne’s crowd should be
allowed to extend its works, and that, by way of
repayment, it should be given the right to squeeze
Broken Hill through its water supply for an addi-
tional 14 years or thereabouts. If Wade finally
agrees to that pretty scheme it will be a sight for
the gods— Wade, the leader of the crowd which
shrieks about “Victorian influence,” handing
over to a Victorian syndicate a section of the
people of N. S. Wales with the full knowledge
that, when these people want a drink of water, they
will only be able to get it by first paying toll to
the syndicate.

An Advertisement for Australia.
Thus the Sydney Evening News (26/7/’08) on the
inevitable local youths who, as youths do in most
other'parts of the world, tend to become mildly
exuberant in public on one small lager and a cigar-
ette whenever a row or a celebration is in pro-
gress :
They are absolutely devoid of all sense of decency, or
of respect of man, woman or child. They are young
Australians of a most degenerate and degraded type. . . .
They are an abiding menace to this city and to its repu-
tation. . . . We do not think that the Inspector-General
of Police quite realises to its full extent the threatening
possibilities for trouble of this factor in the social economy
of the city for the maintenance of whose peace he is
responsible. Otherwise, he would have issued instructions
to his men to deal with these “ brigades ” in a very dif-
ferent style than the one that is customary—an arrest
here and there at random, and the subsequent trifling
fine. When the yelling hordes sweep through the city,
as is their custom in any time of public stress or excite-
ment, all that the police can do is to look on helplessly.
In New York they promptly and mercilessly club them.
In London and Paris they round them up in shoals and
drive them to the station cells.
It is pertinent to ask, in the first place, what
crimes or serious damage these “brigades” have
lately been responsible for ? In the recent strike
a few—a very few—misdemeanors were com-
mitted. One or two of the larrikin class threw
eggs. There was a vague rumor that someone
had actually projected a piece of blue-metal.
Several strikers, greatly daring, remarked “black-
leg ” or “scab” to the men who were filling
their places. In each and every case the offender
was run in without hesitation or mercy, and
thereafter fined or imprisoned. The police-court
proceedings revealed that these peace-disturbers
were, almost to a man, personally interested in
the strike. The police didn’t arrest any of the
non-striking young men that the News classes as
“degenerates,” for the simple reason that none of
them, so far as the force knew, had done anything
illegal. It is not a crime for a man to “sweep
through a city,” provided he does no injury to
his fellow-man or to his fellow-man’s property
while sweeping ; it is not a crime to laugh pub-
licly; it is not even a crime to cheer in modera-
tion. The News, which always creates the im-
pression that it has a very limited range of travel,
is grotesquely in error as to the way other
countries treat their exuberant young men. On
each succeeding “boat-race night” in London,
scenes of revelry occur about Leicester Square,
Regent-street and Piccadilly which cause any-
thing of the sort that Australia provides to look
as tame as a mothers’ meeting. A proportion of
the Oxford and Cambridge undergraduates and
their friends, and a following of shop-boys, etc.,
swarm out of the music-halls about 11 p.m. on the
night following the day the inter-University race
has been rowed, and “take charge” of part of
the West End. A good many of them —unlike
the Sydney lads, who are an almost priggishly
temperate lot—are drunk. The London bobby
doesn’t dream, however, of “rounding them up in
shoals.” Where he meets a youth who is so
drunk as to be a menace to himself or to
those in the neighborhood he quietly leads
him to the nearest lockup, and next morning
the erring one sustains a genial magisterial
rebuke and a nominal fine. But such cases are
rare. And so in Paris. The art students maffick
annually about Christmas time on Montmartre.
They “ sweep the streets” of their quarter from
midnight till daybreak. But no sane Paris
constable takes any notice so long as they only
“sweep”; no sane citizen regards their
hilarity as “degeneracy”; the paper that sug-
gested “driving them in shoals to the station
cells” would be laughed to death by all Parisians
with a sense of proportion. The idea of the News
that local lads who go in for this sort of mild
frivolling should be “clubbed mercilessly” would
read like an unpleasant joke did it appear in
any less portentously solemn paper. London
Daily Mail starred an extract from the News,
dealing with the recent New Year’s celebrations,
under the scare-heading, “ Anarchy in Australia.”
As presented, it gave the British burgess, who
had never met the horrible Australian Tory
Stinking Fish organ, and so didn’t know its men-
dacious habits, the impression that at stated
intervals limb and life are in deadly peril in the
Commonwealth. The Daily Mail, and other
papers of its type, will undoubtedly feature the
News’ latest disgraceful slander upon this coun-
try. The fact that the thing is a palpable and
gross misrepresentation won’t worry the Daily
Mail any more than it worries the News. It is
an unfortunate circumstance that Australia’s suc-
cessful business men are generally the first to de-
nounce social conditions here when they go
abroad. That its daily papers, whose statements
are eagerly quoted by widely-circulating British
journals, should do the same is calamitous.
Japan's Attitude towards China.
From a correspondent in the Far North :
For a considerable time relations between Japan and
China have not been of the most congenial nature ; and
as events develop the strain is intensified. The animosity
began when China was excluded from the Portsmouth
Peace Conference, as she was the party most seriously
affected by the conditions of the new treaty under
negotiation between Japan and Russia ; and the Chinese
suspicions of Japan thereby aroused were confirmed by
Japan’s impetuous anxiety to succeed to all the rights
and privileges formerly enjoyed by Russia in Manchuria.
The ink upon the Treaty of Portsmouth was hardly
dry when Japan seized the valuable Fushun coal mines,
and attempted to justify her expropriation of them as
being the property of the South Manchuria Railway.
China protested that the regulation under which Japan
claimed the mines applied only to the main line of the
railway, from which the Fushun mines were distant over
30 miles. Japan treated the protest with disrespect, andi
retained the property, which is still being exploited by
the Japanese. From this time the Chinese officials
became aware of the real attitude of Japan, and began to
realise the difficulties of dealing with the intruder. The
seizure of the Fushun mines was quickly followed by that
of the rich Yalu timber limits ; and during the whole
course of the dispute that arose between China and
Japan over this action, the latter has been exploiting
these Chinese forests. Then came Japan’s occupation of
Chientao, an island that had always been regarded as
Chinese territory and is so designated on all foreign
charts. Not only did the Japanese ignore China’s pro-
test, but they established a form of government right
under the eyes of the Chinese officials in local control,
and the Tokyo Diet, at its last session, actually appro-
priated 80,000 yen for the exploitation and control of
Chientao. With most nations this would have been the
straw to break the camel’s back ; but China’s back is
vast and takes a long time to break.
The last phase of Japan’s attitude towards China is
that evidenced by the Tatsu Maru affair. This Japanese
steamer had been for months engaged in supplying arms
and ammunition to the revolutionists of South China,
and with the connivance of the Japanese authorities.
For some time the Chinese officials had been watching
for an opportunity of seizing the ship, which they finally
succeeded in doing. Japan’s attitude in peremptorily
demanding the release of this purveyor of contraband
and her cargo, and China’s enforced acquiescence in this
demand, are yet fresh in the world’s mind. In the
Chinese mind it rankles as does nothing that has hap-
pened by way of insult in recent years, and it led to the
Chinese boycott of Japanese goods. Japan has protested
to the Pekin Government against this boycott; but as
the Chinese, like other people, have a right to buy where
and what they please, the Chinese Government can do
little. Imperial proclamations have been posted against
it, but it goes on with fervor.
China regards Japan as entirely the aggressor; and
most foreigners in the “ Far East ” concur in the Chinese
opinion. Consequently, the onus of promoting a better
feeling with China rests mostly on Japan. The question
whether this can be hoped for is an important one. Every
resident knows that the average citizen of Nippon holds
China and all things Chinese in contempt; and Japan
displays little of either respect or consideration for any-
thing politically weaker than herself. The story of her
rule in Formosa and Korea will go down in history as a
record of brute force, un tempered by the faintest degree
of mercy, triumphing over weakness and ignorance. The
Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs recently warned
China to take account of Korea’s fate. In fact, it is the
prevailing impression here that only the restrictionary
influence of the great Powers saves China from the des-
tiny of Korea.

The Misfortunes of Ma.
Above all others, the Commercial Bank of Sydney
is the bank of N. S. Wales. The great Bank of
N. S. Wales, though it has its head office in
Sydney and branches in nearly every town of the
State, has establishments also in every other
State and in Maoriland ; but, except for about a
score in Queensland and the London office, the
Commercial of Sydney has no branches outside
N. S. Wales. It hasn’t even an office in Mel-
bourne. Therefore the tribulations that have
come to the Ma State as the result of Federation,
with its “Victorian tyranny” and all the rest of it,
must naturally have been felt more keenly by
this unfortunate bank than by any other. Doing
business only in the two States that have been
robbed and exploited, naturally it must show all
the signs of the robbery and the exploitation.
Banks are financial barometers, and if the other
States have battened on N. S. Wales particularly,
and on Queensland considerably, as the State
Frighters of N.S.W. allege, then the Commercial
of Sydney couldn’t possibly help being by now a
poor, stricken, wasted thing, living only on the
glories of the past, and seeing nothing in the
future but gloom and more decay. That is the
only picture that it is possible to paint with the
pigments of the State Frighters. And yet—well,
here are the half-yearly profits for seven and a
half years past, the years of robbery and exploita-
tion and battening:—
June, 1901.. ..£51,509 June, 1905 .. ..£65,204
Dec., 1901 .. .. 51,228 Dec., 1905 .. .. 65,263
June, 1902.. .. 51,249 June, 1906 .. .. 66,022
Dec., 1902.. .. 51,254 Dec., 1906.. .. 67,982
June, 1903.. .. 51,455 June, 1907 .. .. 71,500
Dec., 1903.. .. 58,768 Dec., 1907.. .. 83,005
June, 1904.. .. 64,649 June, 1908.. .. 90,973
Dec., 1904 .. .. 65,555
In 110 half-years of fatness and freedom —110 half-
years in which there was no Federal tyranny, no
Commonwealth oppression, no Victorian con-
spiracy—this bank had built up a business
which provided the shareholders, nearly all
Ma Staters, with a profit of £51,509. Then fol-
lowed 15 half-years of tyranny, conspiracy, etc.,
and the profits amounted to £90,973 ; so that the
15 half-years of oppression added almost as much
to the profits as the 110 half-years of glorious
freedom and fatness and alleged Freetrade had
brought. Nor is that all. Two years ago the
State was bounding ahead so fast under the in-,
vigorating influences of tyranny and oppression
and a devastating Protectionist tariff that the
directors of the Gommercial Banking Co. in-
vited the shareholders to put up more
capital. If the Ma State Frighters really believed
one word of all the wild screeches about robbery
and spoliation, of course they wouldn’t have put
up the money. But they did put it up; and no
sooner had they put it up than, for a share for
which they had paid £l5, they demanded £27 ;
and they got it—got it in many cases from men
who paid the money with their hands while they
cried “Woe!” with their mouths. That was 18
months ago. And now listen once more to the
chairman of this necessarily harassed and dis-
tressed bank :
Owing to the great advance in the business of the
bank, the Board thinks that the time has arrived when
the capital should be further increased. It is, therefore,
proposed that the bank’s capital be augmented by the
issue of 20,000 new shares of £l2 10s. each, making the
paid-up capital £1,500,000, the shares to be allotted at
par in the proportion of one new share for every five old
ones. Any shareholder electing to pay all the instal-
ments in full may have the privilege of doing so, receiv-
ing full dividends from the dates of payment. I have only
to remind you of the great expansion in the business of
the State, as shown lately in the published figures of the
Federal Treasurer for the financial year ending June 30th,
the total revenue collected through the Customs, Post
Office and Telephone services amounting to the large sum
of £5,821,000, being 43 per cent, larger than the amount
collected in Victoria. The increase in this State' alone
was £1,039,000 for the year, being almost half that of the
other five States of the Commonwealth. You are, of
course, aware of the larger revenue from our railways,
and the great extensions to the various outlying places.
This has urged us to be in readiness to cope with the
progressive business we see ahead.
This bank pays a 10 per cent, dividend (in the 10
years before Federation devastated the land
wherein it dwells it only paid, from 5 to 9 per
cent.); and, after seven and a half years of suffer-
ing, it finds that it can not only pay TO per cent,
on new capital, but it can do it so comfortably
that, if shareholders like to pay up all the money
for the shares in a lump, it will pay the full divi-
dend on the full amount forthwith. Moreover, as
the result of their experiences, gained during
these seven and a half years of woe (and 10 per
cent.), the directors announce that they want to
“ be in readiness to cope with the progressive busi-
ness we see ahead.” Here, then, we have a concrete
example for the benefit of State Frighters. Stinking
Fishermen, and general howlers about Victorian
robbery, Federal outrages, and the miseries of
Protection. They have all used a vast quantity
of whirling words, vague and inconsequential.
Here are some hard, definite figures ; and if you
can’t measure robbery by hard, definite figures,
then you can’t measure it at all. It is an amazing
sort of robbery that leaves a man 80 per cent.
better off than he was before the disaster hap-
pened to him, and even then holds out promises
of still larger and better things in store.
A Snuffler in Japan.
That nice moralist, Dr. Awdry, Anglican Bishop
of South Tokio, was lately reported by cable as
saying that Australia’s dread of invasion by the
Japs is inspired by “ the uneasy consciences of
those who are keeping lands they cannot use them-
selves.” He adds, however, that Japan will cer-
tainly kick against the immorality of the idea that
whites may penetrate Japan while the Japanese
are excluded from Australia, the country that is
so utterly lost to a sense of decency and fair deal-
ing as to want to reserve thousands and thousands
of acres for which it has no immediate use. This
fine, philanthropic sentiment has been uttered by
many stray parsons and godly politicians, and in
reply a whole lot of people would like to know why
it is so hideous a sin for a country to want
to save up land for its old age, while
thrift in coin, and food, and houses, and other
valuables is so splendid a virtue that the holy and
the high-placed are never weary of exalting it.
Why do bishops who are stout and frantic up-
holders of the rights and privileges of property in
other directions, assume towards Australia the
shockingly Socialistic attitude of the low man
possessed of a devil, who contends that no person,
however sacred, has a right to more goods than he
can conveniently use at the moment? If Australia
has no moral right to the land it isn’t using in the
immediate present, has the Bishop of Tokio any
right he can defend before Heaven to the pair of
boots he won't need this winter, or the summer
pants at present out of active service ? Further-
more, what about the spare rooms in his palace ?
If it is Australia’s duty to give away its
spare province to Asiatics, it must be
equally his duty to give away his spare
accommodation to the white or brown or yellow
folk who need elbow-room for eating and living
and sleeping. The Jap farm is certainly small,
but so is the Jap house, and supposing the small-
ness of the Jap farm gives the Jap a right to our
vacant acres, then the smallness of the Jap house
gives him an equally good claim to the bishop’s
vacant bedroom and unused drawing-rqom. Also
the smallness of his purse gives him a good claim to
the bishop’s spare or unused coin. ,In fact, his
claim on the bishop is far better than his claim on
us, for the holy man says he has a claim and we
don’t; also the holy man snuffles piously on the
subject while we abstain from pious snuffle. And
snuffle is a dreadful and loathly thing.

Bricks and Mortar v. Human Life—Again.
As was expected, the conference of Melbourne
municipal incompetents called to discuss ways and
means of combating the Great White Blague
adjourned to “a date to be fixed” without doing
anything definite. The day previous the Board
of Health had compulsorily removed a far-gone
consumptive from the Fitzrov hovel where he
dwelt, and placed him in the Melbourne Hospital.
It Was significant that it was the Board of Health
that took this action, not the Fitzroy Council;
yet the council’s officers must have known of the
case, and that body should have acted long ago.
The man was one of a dozen persons occupying a
small cottage. He appeared to be cook for the
crowd, and accommodation was so scarce that he
had been in the habit of sleeping in the kitchen.
The hospital authorities received him, though
they pointed out that he could be less expensively
maintained in a Consumptive Home, and would
occupy space in their establishment that would
accommodate three or four ordinary patients..
At the above-mentioned conference it was
authoritatively stated that “the immediate
result of treatment at the Green Yale Sanatorium
(on the dry hillside beyond Broadmeadows) was
most encouraging, but a great number of the
patients relapsed when they went back to their old
conditions of living.” So we get round and back
again to the same old folly and hypocrisy. The
insanitary dwelling on the diminutive piece of
land causes, aggravates and spreads consumption.
The victim may be sent by the State to a hospital
to die, or to a sanatorium to recover ; if the latter
good fortune betides him, he mostly gravitates
back to the same old hovel as before, and the per-
formance is repeated till he reaches the grave.
And on the road thither he assists dozens to the
same destination. Every council in the State
could put an end to this infamy in a few years by
steadily and ruthlessly condemning all insanitary
dwellings, and seeing that they were demolished.
Yet not one council has attempted to do its duty.
Apparently the only hope of getting it done is to
hand over to the Board of Health the complete
care of the public's health, and give it jurisdic-
tion over everything connected therewith, from
the private nurse or foundling hospital to the
crematorium or the public undertaker.

Strikes, Arbitration, and an Old Lie.
There were some very angry men among the
Sydney tram conductors and drivers on Wednes-
day night last week. By a large majority that
afternoon the men had decided to continue their
strike; yet an hour or two later the executive
declared the struggle off. The truth is that,
though a big body of strikers may have mass meet-
ings every other hour, there are many things that,
the men who manage the business dare not men-
tion, unless they are prepared to show their whole!
hand to the other side. In this case the executive,
no doubt, knew quite well that the tramway men
could not win “on their own,” and it didn’t expect
that they would have to make the attempt. On
all sides it heard words of sympathy ; there pro-
bably wasn’t a union in N. S. Wales that
did not agree in condemning that spy system of
which conductor Croucher had been a victim.
But the Tramway-men’s executive reckoned with-
out the Industrial Disputes Act. The unions
might sympathise, but when it came to showing
their sympathy by either a strike or a money gift,
the law stood in the way. They might refuse to
register themselves under the law, but that didn’t
get rid of the law, or protect them from the
punishments which the law provides. The stodgy
daily papers, simply because they yapped at the
strikers, wave their umbrellas and declare that
the collapse of the trouble was due to “public
opinion ’’—they, of course, being public opinion.
So far as the Industrial Disputes Act represents
public opinion the fiasco was a victpry for publie
opinion; but all that the daily papers had to say
during the strike was quite harmless. It was not
because they believed in the spy system, it was
not because they believed that Croucher was a
thief, it was not because they believed that
Johnson was a Heaven-sent railway and tramway
boss, that the unions withheld the support which
was indispensable; it was simply because the law
forbade them to give this support—the definite
law, and not the vague thing called public opinion.
In fact, what happened is precisely what these
papers have alleged a thousand times couldn’t
happen. All the years they were throwing mud
at the Arbitration Act they said that Arbitration
didn’t and couldn’t prevent strikes. The Bul--

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Young childhood’s sweet dependence
Is manhood’s infamy;
It stains Australian honor,
Such helplessness should be.
We reap the bounteous harvest
By strenuous fathers sown,
We hide behind a Trident
Of fashion not our own.
Look to the fleets of England,
And seek our own in vain
From Sydney Harbor Eastward
To Sydney East again.
Oh, look on Torres Vedras !
Oh, think on Trafalgar !
The glories of our fathers,
The vikings from afar !
Their might on storied battlefields
Has shaken tyrant thrones,
The waterways of nations
Are charted by their bones.
We have their roll of glory,
Fair Justice, equal laws—
The booty of the Lion
Without the Lion’s claws !
Our gallant sires bequeathed us
A splendid trust to hold,
A name of lusty valor
And riches manifold.
Their rest is won, their warfare done,
Our own the watch to-day ;
Yet all unmanned the ramparts stand,
The garrison at play.
The glorious flood of patriot blood
Keeps honor stainless bright;
But black disgrace shall brand the race
Which will not learn to fight.
Eight thousand miles of coastline
Our flaunting standards claim,
From sunrise—Thursday Island—
To sunset—Broome aflame.
No fleet patrols the waters.
No fortress guards the strand ;
The only sword for alien horde
A distant Motherland.
We may not claim dominion
And not make good the claim,
Or take for lasting safeguard
The echo of a name.
On goodly sites for cities
Is heard the dingo’s howl ;
The Roper and the Daly
Are haunts of waterfowl.
The field is still unfurrowed,
The metals still unwon—
The mine wealth dwarfs Pactolus,
The timbers, Lebanon.
A virgin soil awaiting
The coming of her lord ;
And come he must with ploughshare
Or with a reeking sword.
Vast tracks stretch out inviting
To famished Asia’s eyes—
The Warrior’s land of promise,
The Statesman’s longed-for prize.
The fields to feed a nation
Are virgin soil to-day,
And shall a parchment title
The march of myriads stay ?
Earth for him who can win it,
Prize for them who can hold,
Loot of the meanest robber,
An undefended fold 1
Blood is the toll of Kingship,
Peace—and a ready sword,
Arms and the price of safety
Unsleeping watch and ward.
The nation slumbers dreamless
While strong sons vigil keep,
The spoiler’s prey a people
Whose manhood is asleep.
How shall we call Jehovah
In hour of utmost heed
To lead Australia’s armies
Who have no troops to lead ?
With every man a soldier,
A people trained to war,
Small lure for the Invader
Our dear Australian shore.
As surges strike the Leeuvvin
To break again to spray,
Before our patriot levies
His might shall melt away,
And the prowess of our people
The surest guarantee
From stormy Raoul to Vulcan Shoal
Of lasting peace shall be.

Rabbit Destruction : The Newspaper Theory
Exploded On Saturday last the representative of the
Tyree Rabbit Destroyer, when returning from Peak Hill
Show, called on Mr. Hull, a farmer near town, who had
been trying the idea of killing bunny by putting old
newspapers in the burrows, and, after seeing the Auto-
matic Destroyer, asked for a trial, and then took the
machine to one of the burrows, so treated, where rabbits
were seen going in. After putting in a small charge the
burrow was exploded, with the result that the burrow
was practically destroyed and the newspapers sent flying
high in the air—thus exploding the newspaper theory.*

LETIN pointed out again and again that, if Arbi-
tration couldn’t prevent exasperated men occa-
sionally throwing down their tools, it could
anyhow prevent the continuance of strikes, be-
cause it cut off the indispensable supplies to the
strikers. This latest experience amply proves
that. Here was a highly probable ease of injustice
and a system which was liable to result in many
monstrous cases of injustice ; a case in which the
men had practically the universal sympathy of
unionists, and of tens of thousands who are not
unionists (Julian Salomons, K.C., ex-Chief
Justice of N. S. Wales, and for years the leader
of the N.S.W. bar, having personally inquired
into the Croucher matter, actually proffered to
represent the man, without fee, if a Board of
Inquiry were appointed, or if other proceedings
were taken). And yet they were debarred from
either striking in sympathy or voting their funds ;
and so the strike necessarily collapsed. If ever
proof were needed that Arbitration can do what
for years the daily papers persistently alleged
that it couldn’t do, this ease provides gallons of it.
Yet it certainly lands most of the unions of N. S.-
Wales in a very awkward position ; for, though
they can’t effectively strike (unless, of course, they
like to go in for open rebellion), they have banged
the door on the present Act and declared that
they will have nothing to do with it. The Bul-
letin, though it has no love for Wade’s Act, has
already expressed the opinion that the bang was a
mistake, and that the unions can’t too soon feel
for the handle and open the door again. Since
the effective strike has been made impossible, the
only course open is to make the best possible use
of the Act, and trust to the people to be sick of
Wade by next election.

The Demand for Class Legislation.
The “Farmers’ Parliament,” as the daily papers
love to call it—otherwise the delegates of the
N.S.W. Farmers and Settlers’ Association —has
been sitting in Sydney and drafting great schemes
of legislation. Two qualities stand out conspicu-
ously in the record which the delegates put up—
they never once proposed doing anything for them-
selves, but clamored vociferously all the time that
the Government should do everything ; and they
shouted for Glass Legislation with an earnestness
that would have awakened a stone god from his
sleep and made him sit up and say “ Whatfor ?”
Looking down the list of their proposals, there is
hardly one which even pretends to be, directly or
indirectly, for the benefit of anybody but the
farmers. Apparently to the farmers the rest of
the community is non-existent, or rather it exists
merely for the farmers’ benefit. Compared with
the kind of resolutions that a Labor Conference
passes—resolutions which aim at the benefit and
advancement of the whole community—the work
of the recent conference of farmers shows up
the cow-hunting person as a shameless and
glaringly-selfish grabber and spoiler, and his
stupendous insolence is quite as remarkable as his
stupendous selfishness. For days the farmers sat,
steadily passing resolutions for getting something
for themselves at somebody’s or anybody’s
expense. They resolved that the Lands Depart-
ment should regard settlement more than
revenue, which presumably meant that it should
give away the public lands at an even cheaper
rate than heretofore. They resolved that the
Railway Commissioners should supply a whole
truck to. the man with 5| tons of chaff to send,
instead of requiring him, as at present, to produce
six tons before he could be allowed to monopolise
the vehicle; also, that the stock rate should be
reduced, and the stock trains should run faster,
and manure should be carried at half the present
rates, and that special excursion trains
should be run after harvest “ for the
benefit of farmers.” Somewhere about a
dozen resolutions tending to get at the Trea-
sury in small ways for the profit of the
man on the land were pushed through with en-
thusiasm. But the really great effort of the
conference was its decision that the railways
ought not to be expected to pay interest on their
cost; that interest ought to be paid out of taxa-
tion, and fares and freights should be cut down to
a point at which railway revenue would only
cover working expenses and repairs. The
wildly humorous part of the case is that, so
far as the farmer is concerned, rates have
already been cut down to that point or even
lower ; when the State humps a huge bag of wheat
368 miles for eighteenpence there isn’t much
more than axle-grease money in the busi-
ness. There are many people who have
a right to complain about railway charges,
but the farmer isn’t one of them—in fact,
the people who have a just complaint to make
mostly grumble because they pay exorbitant rates
to make up for the huge concessions given to their
bucolic brother. And this favored individual
calmly asks for a concession worth about £2,000,000
a year—one which an income-tax of 4s. in the £
would hardly make good. Still even the grasping
instincts of the Conference might have been over-
looked if it had shown any sign of a tendency to
recognise that there are other people in the com-
munity besides the agricultural person, and that
these other people have some claim to considera-
tion. The blank inability of the farmer person,
when he meets and confers, to understand that
the universe doesn’t revolve around him and his
cow is partly ridiculous and partly pathetic. He
is mostly an Anti-Socialist in theory. He is in
practice the loudest and bitterest howler for State
Socialism that the country can show, but he wants
all the State Socialism for himself. And in his
demands for Class Legislation he is a daisy—not
to say a whale.

The Dirty Meat Supply.
Sydney City Council proposes to make another
attempt to grapple with the horrors of the retail
meat trade in Sydney. A previous well-meaning
effort was vetoed by the Government as being
“too extreme.” But it is difficult to imagine
anything too extreme for the existing evils of the
Sydney meat trade. As things are, cattle and
sheep are landed at the slaughter yards after a
feverish journey from inland without feed and
without water. These slaughter yards are
on a dirty peninsula in the middle of
the industrial area of the city, watered by a
filthy, foul-smelling, semi-stagnant reach of the
harbor. Having achieved death under these de-
pressing circumstances, the meat is carted out for
consumption along filthy, dusty roads, sometimes
in open carts, practically never in vehicles which
are quite dust- and dirt-proof. Arrived at the
retail shops, the meat is wrestled out of the carts
by men who are often dirty, and hung up in shops
that are often dirty, fully open to all the dust and
dirt of the streets. Then it is admired and
sampled by the flies, sniffed at by dogs and
boarding-house-keepers who (in the latter
case only) poke dirty, cotton-gloved fingers
into its crevices to see if it is ten-
der. It has some self-respect maintained in it,
has this poor mortal remains of ox or sheep, by
the fact that usually it is kept in company with
some of yesterday’s meat, and last week’s meat,
perhaps some of last month’s sausages ; so it isn’t
the worst thing in the shop by any means. Finally
it is sold. At that crisis of its career it is severely
man-handled by a usually dirty butcher on a
usually dirty chopping biock, wrapped up in
usually dirty paper, and passed out for consump-
tion ; and the Lord usually has mercy on the
consumer, or we’d all be dead meat ourselves —the
citizens of Sydney and its horde of suburbs.

Among the shipping incidents recorded in the last
week of July, was the arrival of the Inga, which
had an exciting time coming across the Tasman
Sea. Apart from its troubles, the whyness and
the whenceness of the Inga are of interest. It is
a Norwegian steamer, flying the Norse flag, with
a Norse skipper and crew. For months past it
has been a regular trader from Sydney to Mary-
borough, and thence to Maoriland ports, and back
to Sydney, and apparently the law in three States
can’t (or doesn’t) interfere. But that the Nor-
wegian steamer unwarrantably interferes with
the Australian trade there is no doubt. The
timber trade between Maoriland and Australia
should be purely our own trade. If we are so
open-minded as to allow foreign ships to compete
with Australians for trade on the Australian
coast, the foreigners should at least compete on
equal conditions. But in the Inga case, and all
similar cases, the restrictions imposed on Aus-
tralian ships are absent. The sailors, instead of
being paid Australian rates, are paid at cheap
foreign rates. The rules relating to Plimsoll
marks, survey and inspection do not apply to the
Inga, though its competitors (our own ships) are
bound to obey them. According to a recent legal
decision, an Australian who ships on board the
Inga for a passage across the Tasman Sea would,
when once outside the three-mile limit, be
outside the pale of British law, and can
be murdered with impunity so far as
British law is concerned. If the master
of the Inga announced his intention of running
his ship regularly from New York to Boston he
would be clapped into durance vile as a hopeless
lunatic. Similarly, in most other countries—
Australia is almost the only marine lunatic left
nowadays. The Federal Navigation Act, which
seems to have fallen down a crevasse somewhere,
should settle this sort of thing.

The Commission which is struggling over the
improvement of Sydney got down the other day
to the question of the city railway, and found it a
matter of some difficulty. The city railway can
hardly be a simple continuation of the present
line, for the amazing Redfern terminus is piled
high upon top of a sort of camel’s hump, and if
the front of the station was knocked out and the
line extended straight ahead, the train would
immediately fall down a precipice. It is an
artificial precipice, and cost an awful lot of
money, and it makes any straight-ahead
progress almost impossible. So it is proposed
that the city railway should branch off from the
existing line near the old Eveleigh station, and go
under Owe’Sullivan’s terminus, having a way-
side station of its own in the basement,
and go into the city with stations at Goul-
burn-street, Park-street, Martin-place and
Circular Quay. There are to be lifts to con-
vey passengers from the present terminus down to,
or up from, a station on the new city line right be-
low. All this suggests a curious situation. The city
railway, it is said, must be a four-line track, just
like the one from tiydn'ey to Parramatta, so it will
be fit to carry all the suburban traffic. If the
suburban trains all take that city line then it will
be really, to all intents and purposes, the main
line, and the line leading into the present ter-
minus will be a stumpy branch track about half-a-
mile long, ending in an almost deserted mountain
of masonry. And if some of the suburban
trains are run into the present terminus just
to give the premises some work to do, the
passengers will probably object. The present
terminus may still be used for the despatch
and arrival of long-distance trains. But it will
look rather a lonesome place with so little work
on hand, and even the long-distance passenger
will grumble as he bobs down a hole into the
basement with his eight carpet bags in order to
catch the city train, and he will want his train to
go into the city also. Somehow, every scheme
for railway extension into Sydney city begins by
leaving the present terminus practically a stranded
waste of building material by the wayside. It is
unfortunate, but it seems to be inevitable.

An item from the Watchman, the Sydney paper
which sees popes in its sleep :
Mr. Wheeler has thrown down the challenge. He has
repudiated all parties. Henceforth he is going to ask
the Orangemen of New South Wales to take a lone hand
in politics, and fly the flag which stands for “ a Protestant
religion, a Protestant party, fair politics, equal rights,”
plus the Golden Rule. Then politicians will have a
chance of learning our strength.
It is very good of Mr. Wheeler to repudiate all
parties. But when the next list of “selected
Protestant candidates ” comes out in N.S.W. the
chances are, all the same, that they will be just
the old crowd—Freetraders ; people who are
bitterly opposed to the Australian industries
which einploy the mostly Protestant Australian
artisan, and find food and clothes and lodging
for his Protestant wife and his Protestant infant;
and people who yelp continuously for the free
admission of the goods of the Belgian, French,
Austrian, Italian, Bavarian, Spanish, Portuguese
and other foreign Roman Catholics. The Australian
is more strictly Protestant than theaverage of white
races, hut the Orange push in N.S.W. seems to
regard him as a sort of leper who should only get
a chance of a job after every Papist on earth has
been satisfied. Probably the most Protestant
class in Australia is the artisan class, which suffers
most from the insane importing craze of the
Importing Lodge (the name fits far better than
“ Orange Lodge ”), and a strongly R.O. section is
the wharf-laboring crowd which makes a profit
out of the importing foolishness. The impression
that the Orange push in N.S.W. is the disguised
minion of Rome grows stronger every time it
issues its list of candidates.
State Premier Wade told N.S.W. Assembly the
other evening that The Bulletin was a wicked
paper which wanted to blot out State boundaries.
Wherein, as usual, Wade told only half the truth.
The Bulletin certainly does want to blot out
existing State boundaries, because the present
divisions are unscientific and absurd. At the very
moment when Wade was frothing about The
Bulletin’s wickedness, Broken Hill, on the oppo-
site rim of N. S. Wales, was holding a big meet-
ing, and declaring that, as it could get absolutely
no attention from Sydney—which knew nothing
about it, and cared less—there was no alternative
but separation. And a few days before that
Wade himself had announced that, though the
Riverina was nearer Melbourne than Sydney, its
business had no right to go to Victoria, wherefore
the railways which carried the Riverina produce
to the nearest port were “ diverting trade.” After
that it is about time to blot out existing boun-
daries, and lay down some others that will have a
little regard for geography. A system under which
an outlying district is tacked on to a State which
knows practically nothing about it and is not
connected with it by rail, while it is connected
with another State by rail, is too ridiculous to
have the support of anybody but a politician of
Wade’s calibre. If State politicians of the Wade
calibre didn’t climb up to the Premiership, redis-
tribution wouldn’t be such an urgent matter ; but
when they do climb up, and say that trade is
“diverted” because it flows to its natural ports
instead of being dragged unnecessary hundreds of
miles at vast expense in order to fatten the
capital where Premiers like Wade hang out, then
redistribution simply shrieks for immediate
attention.

Once when Miss Margaret Anglin was
playing “ Zira ” a new piece arrived. She read
it, and accepted it, and put it on all inside seven
days. The incident is quoted to show what a de-
cisive young woman Miss Anglin is ; on the other
hand, it might also be quoted as a sample of the
speed with which she was prepared to rush
“Zira” off when something else offered. Even
putting it that way, though, it would be an illus-
tration of the lady’s good judgment. Still it is a
consolation that a better play hasn’t been wasted
on Sydney’s recent sodden weather; for even a
good play wouldn’t have had much chance against
13in. of moisture in a week. The last drama of
the present Anglin season, “The Truth,” will be
put on for the first time hereabouts at Her Majesty’s
on Saturday night. There will be fewer blood-
stains about this piece, and, thank Heaven (if it
isn’t washed away), Miss Anglin will have a
chance, to smile.

The Bulletin swam to Sydney Town
Hall, the other evening, to hear Kubelik, and
found little islands of humanity dotted about in a
sea of hard Vienna chairs. During the softer
passages, when the great man’s violin was singing
under its breath and Mr. de Beaupuis was caress-
ing the ivories like the master he is, the wind could
be heard shaking the building with its teeth, or
rushing round the corner, like a herd of drenched
ghosts intent on blowing somebody’s hat off.
Enormous draughts, like the damp sighs of
bereaved whales, swept up and down the corri-
dors, and the rain rattled on the roof like showers
of arrows. It was a night when even a sea-ser-
pent would have hooted dismally for its umbrella
and goloshes. However, the people who had
braved the disorganised weather had brought
sufficient enthusiasm with them for a full house,
and every item was awarded numerous encores.
The great man will have packed away his fiddle
by the time this sees print, and this scribe—after
a look at the sky—ventures the opinion that our
usually hospitable climate will rain furiously on
his back hair to the very last.

A luminous hole was bored in the rainy
dusk by “The Scarlet Troubadours,” who re-
appeared in Sydney at the Y.M.C.A. hall on
Saturday. When the troupe was here some
months ago, Sydney was not fully seized of the
fact that the combination was one of fine and
finely cultivated voices, male and female. On
Saturday night as much of Sydney as the hall
would hold packed the building until the walls
heaved out and the premises seemed to breathe
heavily. The work the artists do is strikingly
original, in which respect it is like their clothes.
They are clad in black and scarlet; the long
black cloaks of the men are lined with the color
that Holy Writ says is the hue of sin. The girls
are short skirted in the same sanguine tone, and
wear black velvet corset bodices over white
blouses. But in an ethical sense the stage pro-
ceedings of the versatile bunch are as pure as snow
—without its colorlessness. Part-singing, solo-
warbling, and “sketching” may be best
described by those valuable though rather worn-
out expressions, “finished” and “convincing.”
Misses Glenn, Fane and Mosely, and Messrs.
Mannering Cunningham, Waltham Warwick and
Griffiths were responsible for Saturday night’s
programme. The one mistake the Red and Black
visitors make is in asking thruppence for its pro-
grammes. The programme is a humorous piece
of literature, but the audience doesn’t go to the
Variegated Troubadours to buy something where-
with to try its eyes on its homeward-flying tram.

Mark Hambourg closed his season—he will

Great, Hairy Violinist, Kubelik.

Having had as much rain in a week as falls
in damp old London in four months, Sydney has
now-a-nights something of the look of Holland
with the dykes down ; and that gives fresh local
color to “The Red Mill,” the Dutch-American
musical comedy at Sydney Royal. The Mill con-
tinues to grist well for the management.

“ Miss Hook of Holland” continues to
dance, sing and make merry at Sydney Criterion.
Herein she is aided and abetted by bevies of her
countrywomen and men. Anyone who wants to
hear dainty music, well rendered, and get, withal,
a very fair idea of what the people of the Nether-
lands aren’t like, should leave a paste-board (they
are supplied at the various booking offices at
the usual prices) on this fascinating little lady and
her companions without delay.

the indigenous youth, wall foot it the more

According to the managerial advertise-
ment, Sydney Tivoli has at present “the most
perfect combination of artists ” ever brought
together by Mr. Rickards. The statement is
made on the authority of some weighty work of
reference called “The Annals of Vaudeville.”
The Bulletin has not yet seen a copy of this
work, but it is now engaged polishing its spectacles
in boiling water in anticipation of some good
reading. Miss Mignonette Kokin, the Miles-
Stavordale Quintette, Regan and Ryan, Tod
Lowen, Fred Bluett and Baby Watson are the
18-earat twinklers of the present setting of stars ;
Galetti’s dogs and baboons combine instruction
with amusement by representing how thirsty
people drive up to closed hotels in hansoms and
clamor for drink ; and one or two performers are
reluctantly forgiven. Charity—which is not a
very elastic substance —begins at home and ends
with a snap at the variety show.

“ The Mummy and the Humming-Bird,”
at Adelaide Royal, is a good play spoiled. If it
ended briskly at the 3rd act, with wife and hus-
band reconciled, and the villain sent out into the
cold world with five minutes’ start of an avenging
Dago, all would be well. But it drags out through
a long, unnecessary 4th act, in which husband and
villain, although at deadly enmity, actually
exchange “ chaff,” and score small verbal triumphs
at each other’s expense. At this point it becomes
evident that the author is an American; it is
evident all through that he ' has studied
in a French school —the ingenious school
of Scribe and Sardou, where a half-crown and a
broken plate are played with near the start, and
come in neatly with an important and quite
different significance near the finish. The play
suffers through coming right on top of “John
Glayde’s Honor.” Adelaide, which has not had
a “society scandal” worth calling such for 20
years, is wondering whether it is really true that
a woman with a good but rather neglectful hus-
band must always turn for consolation to the
most worthless male person in sight. Ladies

gasped at the sudden close of “John Glayde”
because it had not a “happy ending.” They
would have blinked the wife’s lurid record and
her Judas-kiss, and welcomed a patched-up recon-
ciliation ! Flemming, through sudden illness,
left the end of the Mummy’s short run to Winter
Hall, who scored heavily. With “The Morals of
Marcus,” Homewood and Miss Guilford-Quin
come into the limelight. Miss Beatrice Day scores
heavily all the time. The play of “ Marcus ”
follows the book pretty closely, except that the
runaway heroine comes back as spotless as she
left. Why does a drama have to be so much
more conventional than a novel ?

Revived at Melbourne King’s last Satur-
day night, “The Squatter’s Daughter” has
apparently not lost its hold on such as prefer their
drama scenic and sudden. On the present occa-
sion this appalling success has the benefit of an
extensive stage allotment, which permits it to
caper much more cheerfully than it did at the
Bijou. Indeed, the piece has the same effective-
ness in representation as in the first days of its
youthful extravagance at the Royal, although the
body of it lost a little of its fascination on the first
night by the failure of a couple of new attractions.

vival, unfortunately wouldn’t box, but retired in
shy confusion—evidently moved to protest by the
passionate energy of the orchestra, which, at the
time, was capable of moving an elephant. Also,
the gorge, in which G. Cross is tied up in an atti-
tude of frozen and funny doom, wouldn’t dawn
satisfactorily. The foreground would persist in
remaining in the cold grey prose of about 7 a.m.,
when the horizon was bursting in the rich red
poetry of an Andersonian sunrise. Otherwise
the play gambolled with the frisky incoherence of
yore. Miss Eugenie Duggan is, of course, Violet
Enderby, and, as of old, reveals a wardrobe
with a range of four octaves. George Cross
is still the Quixotic protagonist of shame-
less virtue, and Laurence Dunbar the cronk
son of a cronkeyi parent. Laurence is a little
more lugubrious now, and seems o’ercast with the
burden of his futile malignancy; while his pa
(Harry Douglas) aids his conspicuous appearance
with a glibness that defies criticism. For the
rest, McPhairson babbles inadvertently through
the popular pink countenance of Bert Bailey ;
and Miss Spriggins (Miss Georgie Leighford) has
become a Dampish female of reduced stridency.
Ned Duggan continues to bushrange inside the
bashed hat and frowsy garb of Ben Hall, and all
the insane circumstances of former occasions
happen amidst roars of approval.

“ Two Little Sailor Boys ” at Melbourne
Royal is, in its central aspect, the oft-told tale of
the Bad, Bad Woman who has committed bigamy
with a mild old gentleman, after waltzing round
the world in search of human prey. The elderly
victim of this bigamy is an Admiral of surpassing
credulousness, and he has a grown-up daughter.
One of the suitors for her hand—the villain one—
is a naval official with whom the Bad Woman
formerly “kept house,” even as Paula Tan-
queray had foregathered with Captain Ardaile.
Also, a hard - countenanced burglar, who
breaks into the Admiral’s domicile with the
aid of an unwilling boy, turns out to be
another former paramour of the Bad Woman,
whilst the boy is incidentally revealed as her for-
saken offspring. Therefore, when the gallant
hero of the drama—the chosen suitor of the
Admiral's daughter—happens on the scene after
the burglar and the boy have departed, the Bad
Woman lays charges against him and virtue
starts to suffer. Matters are so mixed for luckless
Jezebel that she is bound to persecute the gallant
hero in order to cause uproars in her unlawful
husband’s family.
* * * *
Thenceforth she becomes worse than ever.
The boy she gave birth to in her earlier evil days
pursues her with filial affection. His one idea is
to meet her by stealth and call her by the sacred
name of “Mother,” and beg for kisses. So she
gets little Tom on a rustic bridge in the pale
moonlight, and kisses him, and topples him into
the water, from which he is rescued by little Cyril
—her stepson. Those boys, who ultimately join the
Navy, have learned to love one another like Two
Little Vagabonds, although the stepson, as his name
implies, was a young gentleman from the outset.
In spite of Mother’s inhumanity, the faithful Tom
continues to crave her kisses. When she pre-
sently murders the burglar, her offspring accuses
himself of the crime, just to save Mother.
Had she also slain the tony villain, her child
would doubtless have accused himself some more,
but he is saved from further perjury by the re-
appearance of his father from S’Africa." Father
comes back from Ladysmith in spotless kharkee,
and the boy, having now acquired one decent
parent, permits his disrespectable other one to be
led off to execution.
* * * *
The drama otherwise is a tissue of comic
relief and virtue in distress, composed by the
author of “The Midnight Wedding,” etc. The
relief is so crudely frivolous that Miss Maud
Chetwvnd, as a musical comedy soubrette,
seems almost suitable to the proceedings.
Some of the legitimately distressful charac-
ters get better treatment than they de-
serve. Wilson Forbes, more vigorous and
upstanding than of old, is the gullible admiral;
James Lindsay burgles impressively enough ; and
the hero has a genial, foggy voice that reminds
one of the late Dan Barry. Of the tony villain it
can only be said that he is a fitting companion in
plumpness to Miss Lilian Meyers, a merely pass-
able actress who offers very little suggestion of
conflicting emotions, but possesses a certain
heavy voluminousness of style which counts for
something in melodrama. The step-daughter
lady, on the other hand, is weak in all respects,
especially in voice. In the name parts
Miss Louise Carbasse and Maisie Maxwell
present pleasing she-boy appearances. The
former is mostly restricted to pert and pretty
business, whilst Miss Maxwell has to endure
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
She shows a lot of natural force at the outset,
and, except for a slight superabundance of pose
and gesture, her first appeals to Mother are
artistic acting. Later on, the character of boy
Tom grows wearisome, and the impersonation takes
a sickly turn. Its prolonged devotion to an awful
Mother had worn it out. Bright staging will
assist towards keeping “ Two Little Sailor Boys”
in position for two or three weeks. Ere the end
of the month, George Musgrove’s new opera co.
will open at the Royal. The coming event has
been foreshadowed by an impressive advt. for
chorus ladies, which exhorts them—in the un-
paralleled language of John Wren—to abstain
from bringing outside influence to bear upon the
management. No bribery or corruption will be
permitted at the election of chorus ladies in the
kingdom of Wren.

There was a crowded house at Her Ma-
if sty’s (Melbourne) on Saturday for a revival of
“The Dairymaids” (the final production of the
season), and the bulging assemblage gave a glad
hearing to that serviceable piece of extravagance.
The cast differs in sundry places from what it was
aforetime. Carrie Moore has succeeded Fanny
Dango, and the atmosphere of Lady Brudenell’s
Model Dairy and Miss Pyechase’s Academy
seems all the brighter for the change. Carrie has
a soubrettish personality and a distinctive alert-
ness. The one thing that was the matter with her
on Saturday night was the tragedy glare in her
eye when she sang the song of the Sandow Girl —
a glare which she had unconsciously, perhaps,
carried over from her “Merry Widow” perform-
ance. Andrew Higginson frivols in the part that
Fred Leslie filled last year, and one’s previous
good opinion of that new and adored young man
from the Cold Country is confirmed by his
frivol. He may be inclined to play the giddy
goat in his gayest mood, but his manner of doing
it is always natural. If Higginson were to die of
adoration to-morrow, the word “ mummer ”
couldn't fairly be carved on his marble slab.
W. S. Percy is a cheerful little Joe Mivins, and
Miss Opie is a commanding high priestess of the
butter factory. Among the people who have re-
sumed their former duties, Miss Milne is awarded
honorable mention for improvement. Also the
pretty girls in the very minor parts—the visions
who get three lines to speak and 30 choruses to
sing—can consider themselves favorably noticed.
May Heaven preserve them until the co. returns
to Melbourne.
On Saturday the charming story of ‘ ‘ Peter
Pan ” will be told again at Her Majesty’s, with
Miss Tittell Brune and everybody else as before.
The dainty show is for a fortnight only.
** * *
Also “Mrs. Wiggs” is leaving for elsewhere
this week. On Saturday comes “ The Prince
Chap ” to the Princess’s, with 11. R. Roberts in the
name part, likewise a number of strange faces from
abroad in his company. Roberts, as appears
from the advt., has been 10 years absent from
his native land, and “The Prince Chap” is a
comedy-cum-drama (written for him by an
American author) wherein he played a long
innings at a London theatre. Several' other
particulars of the impending novelty are adduced
as reasons why H. R. Roberts aforesaid should get
a prosperous time in Melbourne, under the direc-
tion of Harold Ashton and Allan Hamilton.
** * *
A change of programme happened to the
Maskelyne and Devant show at the Bijou last
Saturday. Also the films at Olympia were changed
as usual, and West’s series of Shaksperian tabloid
plays was inaugurated (on the silent screen) with
an amusing version of “ Macbeth.” At the Town
Hall the musician of the moment is Mark Ham-
bourg, due to give his first recital on Tuesday of
this week.
** * *
At the Opera House the reddened nose of
Austin Rudd will glow no more after this week,
neither will the Meymotts remain much longer
on the job. But the Arabs of Abdullah will
whirl until further notice, and where the Arabs
are there will the public be gathered together. A
question of sex having arisen in the case of the
long-haired young Arab who whirls the fastest of
them all, this paper is authorised to mention that
the alleged young woman is only a boy who
doesn’t get his hair cut. Arabs, as a rule, are
demons for getting their hair cut.
AT POVERTY POINT.
There died, recently, at Port Fairy (Vic.), an old stage
identity who dated back to the late ’fifties. She was Miss
Maggie Liddle (Mrs. Hilton), who for many years took
part in opera and concerts. In the ’sixties, Torn Rainford
(baritone and publican) and J. H. Melvyn, having seceded
from the Christy Minstrels, formed a concert company with
Miss Maggie Liddle as their leading lady. Later she took
to opera and played the Duchess de la Valta in “ Tambour
Major,” opening on Boxing Night, 1880, at Melbotrrne
Opera House, under George Musgrove’s management.
The piece ran (and the ghost walked) for 101 nights, after
which Musgrove took it to all the chief Australian towns.
“ W.F.M.” : It was 53 years ago last month since the
Theatre Royal, Melbourne, was opened. So an old pro-
gramme in my scrap-book reminds me. John Black was
manager, and W. M. Akhurst wrote an inaugural
address, which was spoken by Mrs. Charles Poole. “The
School for Scandal ” occupied first place ; G. H. Rogers
was Sir Peter Teazle, C. Walsh was Sir Oliver Surface,
and Mrs. Poole Lady Teazle. Then followed a national
Spanish dance by Mrs. Strelinger and Mr. Carandine ; a
farce, “The Actress of All,” bringing the entertainment
to a close. Charles Poole was stage-manager, Thom con-
ductor, Strelinger leader of the orchestra, and Horne
scenic artist. The prices of admission were : dress-circle,
12s. 6d. ; stalls, 10s. 6d. ; upper circle, 7s. 6d. ; pit, ss. ;
gallery, 2s 6d. For 17 years plays were produced there ;
then the flames came along, and the Theatre Royal was
no more. In November, 1872, the place was rebuilt, and
the lessees w'ere Messrs. Harwood, Hennings, Stewart and
Coppin. The opening address was penned this time by
Dr. Neild, and Miss Docy Stewart was entrusted with the
reading of it. The comedy, “To Oblige Benson,” was
staged, Miss Docy Stewart and Messrs. G. W. Collier, G.
Coppin and John Munro appearing in the caste ; also
“ Milky White,” with Geo. Coppin in the name part, Dick
Stewart as Dick Duggs, Nellie Stewart as the Rude Boy,
Mrs. Crosbie as Mrs. Sadrip, and Miss Maggie Stewart as
Annie White. Prices had by that time dropped to 55.,
35., 2s. and.ls. .
One of the most impressive things at Sydney Tivoli just
now is the severe deportment of John Higgins, billed as
the champion jumper of the world. Higgins does his re-
markable bounding with the aid of a pair of dumb-bells, and
the instant he lands on his feet, after clearing 49 chairs, he
drops the dumb-bells as if he w’ere finished w'ith them for
ever. He isn’t, though, for, while one stage-hand rushes
about rearranging the 49 chairs for another series of
leaps, a second footlights rouseabout dashes at the two
rolling ironmongeries like a shark after a surf bather,
and, after picking them up, pursues the haughty per-
former and places them reverently in his hands. It is
all very magnificent, and lends an air of distinction and
solemnity to what would otherwise be a rather frivolous
act.
Actor Jimmy Atholwood has been released before his
six months for bigamy were up. It was a wise move. If
an actor of Atholwood’s calibre must ’ o six months
the event should be postponed till he is ( 5 so, and has
seen his best stage days. To shove him imogaol in his
prime is an injury to the public and a national calamity.
A comedian, at present mumming in Melbourne,
journeyed out from the Cold Country by the same vessel
that brought the new Admiral’s lady, and with her
became slightly acquainted. “ Where will you be stay-
ing in Sydney?” inquired the actor. “At Admiralty
House,” replied the naval lady. “Oh,” said the mum-
mer, “ I might put up there too. I suppose their terms
are reasonable ? ”
“S.S.”: Apparently the Shepherd’s Bush exhibition
has been a Godsend to a lot of Australians who went to
London to make their fortunes. Quite a number of
dabblers in the various arts, who rushed to the Big- Smell
(motor cars have converted the Big Smoke into the Big
Smell) with the intention of sounding Fame’s loud tim-
brel in the ears of the millions, are grateful for 30s. a
week as ushers and official spruichers about the courts.
The Tait brethren hope to scoop another pool with a
vocal counterpart of the Besses o’ th’ Barn Band. The
Besses were mill hands, or factory blokes, before they
started to earn better wages through the instrumentality
of brass music. And the Royal Welsh Male Choristers,
whom the Taits have engaged for an Australasian tour,
were miners—some of them —ere they abandoned hard
graft and took to singing in a professional way. Their first
venture abroad was a tour through America, where their
voices and their Welshness got a great reception. They
come from Treorchy, but, if occasion requires any
stronger “ Taffy ” recommendation, the Taits will prob-
ably bill them as the original men of Harlech.
After much litigation, which climbed at last to the
High Court, Doodeward, the showman, has recovered his
unwholesome two-headed baby, with Costs. The police
seized the dreadful thing. Doodeward asked, in the
N.S.W. District Court, for his freak and £4OO damages,
and his case was rejected. He appealed to the Supreme
Court and was thrown out. Now the High Court has
reversed these decisions, so far as concerns the freak, and
Doodeward will again be able to make a lazy living by the
exhibition of the dreadful little scrap of unburied human-
ity. It may be law, but it isn’t pleasant. Two-headed
babies should be discouraged.
The father of the Australian stage is Mr. W. H. Ford,
of Malvern-road, South Yarra (Victoria). He was born in
Bermondsey (London), on Nov. 5, 1830. Before his birth
his mother capered in the front row of the ballet, at
Astley’s, and his grandmother leaped with the celebrated
Ducrow, at Astley’s, years before that. Young Ford
went on the stage at the mature age of six years, dividing
his time between Ducrow’s and the Surrey and Victoria
theatres. In 1848 he came to Sydney and applied for an
engagement at the Victoria Theatre in Pitt-street, then
open only three nights a week. (Joe Wyatt, the builder,
was also proprietor.) There was no show of an engage-
ment, so Ford got work on a station on the Clarence
River, and later on he moved north to a station near
Ipswich. Here he rigged up a theatre for the
amusement of the hands engaged on the run,
and any neighbors or visitors who cared to drop in. There
was no charge for admission, and mostly there was
standing-room only. In 1856, Ford built the first theatre
at Brisbane, and he was the first to introduce the drama
to Ipswich, a large store being converted into a theatre.
In 1858, he opened the first theatre at Parramatta, in the
long room—-detached —of the old Red Cow Inn. He was
likewise the pioneer of the drama at Forbes, Grenfell,
and other golden rushes. He had the post of wardrobe-
keeper and general utility under Barry Sullivan’s
management at Melbourne Royal in the first half of the
’sixties. The old man’s savings nearly all went in the
burst of the early ’nineties, but he still keeps chirpy
notwithstanding his losses and his 77f years. The family
name has been on the stage for a century, and Mr. Ford
has children and possibly grandchildren in the profesh.
“ Harry D.”: In a recent “ Poverty Point ” par. some-
one said that the late Dan Barry wrote all his plays. This
is a mistake. He didn’t write them—he made them up
as the play went on. For instance, a member of the co.
would enter his dressing-room (where Dan always had a
bottle of beer planted in the washstand jug-) and say,
“What are we going to do in my scene in the 3rd act,
Mr. Barry ? I then have possession of the twenty thousand
pounds.” “ I’ll knock you down and find the money and
the missing will in the desk,” Barry would say. “ But I
carry the twenty thousand pounds in my inside breast
pocket,” the other might object, “ and there’s no will in
the piece.” “ H’m ! Well, tell the stage-manager to
arrange a desk to-night, and I’ll break it open—there’s
more action in that; then I’ll wave the money and the
will around (it’ll go better with a will—we’ll ring it in
somewhere)—speech, and exit. Then you come to, and
so on.” Dan Barry’s acting consisted of chopping his
lines into little bits and firing them out, rolling
his eyes until they looked like revolving saucers,
raising his eyebrows until his eyeballs threatened
to fall out on his cheeks, and wrestling with his
hat. The only lines he was perfect in were
those of his ’tween-the-acts speech. On the street he
attracted attention. He, as a rule, wore no collar, unless
it was part of the shirt. The shirt itself was pale blue, to
match the color of his eyes, and his eyes were made up
by darkening around them with ashes of burnt paper.
In one of his “ spectacular pieces” he said to his stage
manager : “ I’ve no lines for you in this piece, but vou
are billed as ‘ William, a rouseabout.’ Just follow the
piece, and gag.” This was enough for any member of his
co. to go on with ; and this actor made up as a drunken,
loony rouseabout, appeared in every act and every scene,
and made the hit of the piece. No One can take Dan
Barry’s place on the Australian stage. As a humorist of
the unconscious order he was simply great. He had no
understudy, and he leaves no successor.
While Greespaint and Limes were carrying their cele-
brated English and American Comedy and Dramatic
Company through the Vic. provinces in a van, it occurred
to the ingenious Greespaint to see how a system of family
tickets would take. So family tickets were advertised at
Lone Star at 10s. 6d. apiece, and the public of the town-
ship and district availed themselves of the innovation.
The co. carried the idea on to Lalor. To the delight of
the gifted management, a splendid crowd assembled in
the street, pressing at the door of the Mechanics’ Hall
quite half-an-hour before the opening time. When at
length the doors were opened, a very feeble patriarch
with a mosaic beard that almost dangled to the floor was
pushed to the front. He presented a half-guinea family
ticket. “Right-o,” said Greespaint, who was assisting
the doorkeeper. “Which is your family?” “The
McLarens and Browns,” answered the patriarch.
“ Eighty-seven of ’em.” The unlimited family pass system
broke down right there.
“ Z.”: I shall never forget Stormer. He used to talk in a
rich, fruity voice, and his bar manner was a spectacle for
the gods. He had a reverence for the stage that was only a
trifle less than the reverence he had for himself, and
beside that adoration idolatry was a small, pale, insig-
nificant circumstance. Whenever Stormer spoke of his
own acting he lowered his voice—you felt on those occa-
sions that slow music was the only thing wanting to make
Stormer complete. A man like that should no more have
gone out without a band of musicians behind him than
an ordinary man should go without his boots. Stormer
had a regal air, for he was a king—one of the real tragedy
kings you read about. He always commenced stories
about himself or his parts, with an exclamation. For
instance : “ Ah! my boy, when I played the Village
Priest,” or “By George! the night I did Cassius,” or
“Great Heaven ! How I thrilled them when I showed
them how to do Scarpia ! ” But he was greatest when
he spoke of his Hamlet. Then his voice sank to a pas-
sionate whisper, and it was “My God! When I played
Hamlet!. .. My God ! Shall I ever forget it ! ” (Pause).
I have seen seasoned barmaids recoil at the sight of
Stormer’s face when he was speaking of his Hamlet.
They used to think he was dying. Some of them were
sorry he wasn’t.
OUR CIRCUS!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the bull-frogs blow their bugles, an’ the bitterns
boom their drums,
And bill-sticker Sunset’s posters are illumined o’er the
sky,
f’rom the lone by-ways of Nature, with the dusk, our
circus comes—
And the crickets’ crazy fiddles tell the world the show
is nigh !
The first item on the programme shows the Ibis troupe at
play ;
Marshalled on the dimming skyline in manoeuvres swift
they swoop
With a boomerang’s precision to where gibbering ghosts
of day
Quiver, while the deft-winged artists loop the lofty
eerie loop.
Then, wearied, the swamp rovers helter-skelter to their
lair,
To lagoons of reedy tangles where coy preening lovers
croon ;
While, within their leafy parlors. Possum couples shy
prepare
For some giddy high trapezin’ to the limelight of the
moon.
The Bat Brothers, ’midst the shadows, in a crazy zig-zag
flight,
Twist an’ turn in frantic fashion till the Mopoke and
his wife
Stop their blinking and get ready—quite averse to face
the light—
Ere they send the flying beetles on their lightning slide
for life.
To the swamp-choir’s intermezzos Kangaroo an’ family
Take the carpet ’neath the big gums in an acrobatic
prance,
Where the crops are green an’ tender —to the plover’s
melody,
In pink tights the Brolga ballet charms the bald gods
with a dance !
The weird Wombat troupe lures laughter as it romps the
ring around,
And the nimble Paddymelons frolic madly o’er the
green ;
Slim the Snake, with sleight of tail, performs quaint
tricks upon the ground,
When frogs disappear in dozens and they- never more are
seen.
The merry moon’s our mechanist, an’ sky-imps trim the
lights
That leak thro’ every crevice where the hosts of Heaven
peep.
On the bushland circus feasting free of charge they spend
their nights,
When the weather is propitious, ere the world is lulled
to sleep.
When the moonbeams mount the shadows, scared buck,
jumpers by the score
Strive to throw their phantom riders at an eerie frantic
pace,
Till the ripples of the river are a-shine with glints galore
As each rider makes his exit badly beaten in the race.
There are devious acts aquatic when the Platypus doth
play;
His deep diving in the eddies s a wondrous sight to
see ;
When the water-rats elude him in an artful sort o’ way
There are peals of dreaming laughter from the Jackass
family.
Jake an’ I dote on the programme—in a leafy nook we sit
Hand in hand, an’ smoodge in whispers with our throb-
bing hearts elate;
There we link our lives, quite heedless how the spangled
hours may flit
Though Time twirls to our undoing the kaleidoscope of
Fate
Ah ! I love to roam the bushland when our giddy circus
comes,
With Jake to hear my secrets, and old Love as funny
clown.
What care we, if all Life’s play through, glum bitterns
boom woe’s drums
If Love only keeps us laughing till Death rings the
curtain down !

A Picture Show.
“ Ckitic ” writes
Hans Heysen, who opens, on the Bth, the last picture
show to be held at the Melbourne Guild Hall, is the finest
draughtsman of landscape Australia has yet produced.
Heysen’s beginnings as an artist are like an old-world
anecdote. His artistic instinct was awakened by a fear-
some copy of “ Swans and bulrushes,” made by a'brother
toiler in the ironmonger’s shop in which he worked. His
pocket-money then amounted to but 3d. a week. First
week he purchased a tube of flake-white, second
week a tube of chrome yellow, third week a
tube of Prussian blue, fourth week a brush. Then he
commenced a masterpiece that must have screamed like a
wounded parrot. Thenceforward all his spare time was
devoted to landscape. A dealer bought some of his works
at evilly small prices, and made 500 per cent, on the deal.
Subsequently he employed Heysen at 555. a week to pot-
boil—six water colors or three oils a week representing
the pound of flesh. At auction those early works averaged
At the end of five months of this over-production four
Adelaide gentlemen interested themselves in the rising
young artist, and eventually sent him to Europe for
four years’ study. He went to Paris, London, Berlin and
Venice, and worked hard, pre-occupied by the study of
light and color. He understands the art of Turner as
much as that of Claude Monet, and to his sterling
draughtsmanship unites a profound yet subtle power of
observation. To-day Heysen is the strongest and most
promising landscape painter in Australia.
Of the 120 works he is exhibiting, the largest are two
fine oils, “ Timber Getting” and “ Giant Gums,” in which
for the first time the great eucalypt is painted as it de-
serves.
For his water-colors, we have had nothing else so good
in Australia before. In these a largeness of vision, a
splendid appreciation of the opposition of color, and a
capability of rendering atmospheric mystery, are three
conspicuous virtues.
Hans Heysen is a genuine artist. He loves Australia,
and wishes for nothing better than to individualise its
beauty. Melbourne, which has shown half-a-dozen Aus-
tralian artists an Athenian appreciation, cannot but be
pleased with the fine show' Heysen offers to its discrimi
nating public.

Ifc is reported that the mails between
Sutton Grange and Elphinstone (Yie.) are carried
by a woman who is nearly 80 years of age. Some
days ago her horse, which is also past its first youth,
dropped from exhaustion, and next day she
trotted along on foot with the mail bag a distance
of nine miles. The attention of the Postal
Department has been drawn to the matter, and
“inquiries are being made.” If that means that
the department can see its w r ay to raise the old
dame’s pay a little and buy her a new horse and a
bag of oats, or to pension her off, the news is
good ; but if the inquiries only result in her being
sacked in the name of humanity, the thing were
better left alone.

To realise how deep-set is the S.A. habit
of doing things soberly and without a row, read
the official report of Sheriff Scliomburgk on
an “offence of a serious nature” in the (so-
called) Stockade prison. A Legislative
Councillor said some unkind things
about habitual criminals during a de-
bate, and somehow this became known
in the prison. On a later Sunday he
went out, as a member of the Prisoners’
Aid Association, to a service in the
Stockade chapel. Did the convicts
mutiny? Did they throw rocks at
him ? Did they hiss and hoot ? Not
at all. When he appeared, 15 of
the hardened ruffians “deliberately
walked out of church.” A ladies’
school could have done no less; any
public meeting or football crowd
would have done much more. But
church is a serious thing in Adelaide,
and in due time a visiting justice sat
on the 15, and gave them 30 days’
extra gaol each. It was called the
forfeiture of so many “credit marks,”
but 30 days is how it works out.
The English woman suffragist who has
been run in gets every opportunity of being a
martyr. She does 22£ hours’ solitary confinement
out of every 24, and has nothing to read but a
goody-goody tract, and has no toothbrush. Also
when she arrives first at the gaol she is bathed in
cold water, and searched for concealed weapons,
and is expected after that to stand about with
only one clo’ on while she answers the questions
of the female boss warder, and has all the parti-
culars concerning her taken down in a book. You
can’t be a militant suffragette on easy terms in
England.
Suggested text for next Sunday’s sermons
apropos the tram-strike :
Judas had the bag.— St. John, xiii, 29.
And in a week or two, when “ the splendid stamp
of men ” put on as conductors during the strike
[vide Sydney Telegraph) have been sacked for
utter hopelessness and incapacity, after having
received the Employers’ Federation’s reward for
loyalty, their reverences might follow that sermon
up with another, relating to the same person :
He then, having received the sop, went immediately
out; and it was night.— St. John, xiii, 30.

Sydney Watchman has been at it again.
It was so pleased with the “Warning from the
Old Land ” it published on July 23 that it broke
out with another Warning (by “ Stand East”) from
the same asylum last week. Some of it: —
“ Manchester Protestant” opened a subject that badly
needs ventilation here, and one that is creating
interest among thinking Protestants of Continental
Europe—viz., the scheme for the obliteration of
Rome by resumption on equitable terms at the
hands of the enlightened peoples of the world. . . .
It has been left for a comparatively small French paper,
the Dijon L’Eclair, to give publicity to a movement
which is growing with incredible speed throughout the
central and western provinces of the French Republic, in
the Protestant States of Germany, in parts of Switzerland
and of Italy. To give an idea of the strength of the
movement it may be remarked that 37,500 francs (£l5OO
English money) was collected in the little canton of
Bale alone during the last two months by the local Pro-
testant organ, and forwarded to the L’Eclair to add to
its fund.
Hitherto the British press has maintained a conspiracy
of silence in this regard, taking its cue from most of the
Romanist papers of Europe with the exception of La
Croix, and the purblind Papal sheet, El Carajo. These,
till lately, .have affected to laugh the scheme down
the wind. But a man of the type of Maraud-
Safran does not talk or write except of what he knows.
The fact is admitted by the rabid little Romanist rag, the
Era, published from Oscott College, that in the last nine
months four French papers and two Swiss ones have alone
collected £400,000. ... I feel confident that if you started
in The Watchman (say) a shilling subscription, the pro-
ceeds to be ultimately forwarded to L’Eclair’s fund (the
editor-proprietor is Henri Singemoine, and to him all
communications should be addressed), you would receive
an astonishing response. I open the ball with three
shillings (self, Enid M., and “Loyalist”).
“Stand Fast,” like “Manchester Protestant,”
knows “ Maraud-Safran ” —who, being translated,
signifies “ Yellow-Pup’’—and he supplies in addi-
tion a few authorities and facts andnt Rome-
resuming that “Manchester Protestant” never
thought of. The assertion that Emanuel of Italy
is hankering to see the capital city of his kingdom
razed to the ground is absorbing; likewise the state-
ment that £400,000 has been collected for the
destruction of Rome without anyone in the Eng-
lish-speaking countries getting wind of it. How-
ever, there are flaws in the yarn. A few here-
with :
(1) There is no such paper as L’Eclair, “comparatively
obscure,” or otherwise, in Dijon ; there is a Paris daily
of that name, but it is not running a fund to buy Rome
just now.
(2) The purblind Papal sheet, El Carajo, is a phantasy
or figment of the imagination. It does not exist. And
“Carajo” is a Spanish curse of great tonnage that no
respectable paper should print. There is nothing like it
even in “Kim.”
(3) The Era is not a “ rabid little Romanist rag” ; it is
the peaceful organ of the London vaudeville performer—
the sort of harmless sheet wherein Ermyntrude Few-
clothes notifies the profesh that she is “resting,” and
Snitch, the 14-toed marvel, begs for a “shop” at a fair
drinking wage.
(4) Oscott College has been shut for 15 years.
(5) “ Henri Singemoine,” editor-proprietor of L’Eclair,
isahumanPetrianaor myth. “Singe” means “monkey,”
“moine” means “shave.” A French editor-proprietor
hight “ Monkey-shave ” is more incredible than G. Reid.
(6) The three bob forwarded by “ Stand Fast” wouldn’t
go far towards the destruction of Rome, anyhow, and
that’s all the Rome-destruction fund there is.
POOR BILL.

yours got ? ”

UNSUBSTANTIAL DIET.
BENEVOLENT OLD PARTY : “ And have you had nothing to eat this morning?"

The young man who allowed himself to be
locked up in a strong-room at Albany (W.A.). with
the idea of lighting out with the firm’s cash-box,
seems to have made several bad miscalculations.
A strong-room, even with the door wide open, is a
horribly stuffy place. The air is dead and warm,
and if a playful clerk in passing shuts the door on
you for a minute —well, when you get out the
drab office atmosphere tastes like champagne.
The young man at Albany reckoned to last out a
good many hours sealed up in the tomb of Com-
merce, unbolting and drilling through the chilled
steel door, with a hurricane lamp and candle
burning up what little bits of faded oxygen
the place contained. But for the fact
that a countrv branch had been burnt on
the Saturday night, and the firm went down on
Sunday to have a look at the insurances, the
strong-room wouldn’t have been opened till Mon-
day, and then it would probably have contained a
dead typist as well as the cash-box. When the
door was thrown open, an unconscious burglar fell
limply on the office floor, and behind him -as the
result of his hours of frantic toil lay the inner
fire-proof lining of the tomb entrance, with its
forty massive bolts. As well as being out of air,
he was out of light, and his chances of disposing
in pitch darkness of the other 3in. of chilled steel,
and the patent locks would have been about as
good as Buckley’s. A handy text-book on “ How
to Burgle ” is badly wanted.
“Viator,” who seems to be in the beef
line :
Interesting to Australian and Maoriland refrigerating
cos. and to all is the victualling of the U.S. Pacific fleet,
which comes to visit us. During the cruise round the
Born the sailors fared better than they would ashore,
while officers had every rational luxury. All hands
enjoyed fresh meat, butter and vegetables all the time.
Junk was unknown. The provisioning ships were affec-
tionately known as the Beef and Pork, Dairy, Green-
grocery, and so forth. Of course, there was no
room on the warships for refrigeration. A big
steamer named the Culgoa was the principal meat
store. When the fleet reached the west coast of South
America the residents expected to do great business, and
thousands of cattle and sheep were driven to the ports
of Chili and elsewhere. However, this enterprise was
disappointing. It was different in the Russo-Jap war,
with nearly 2,000,000 soldiers and camp-followers in
Manchuria. People asked, “ How on earth are those
masses fed?” knowing t lie slight railroad accommoda-
tion. Both Russians and Japs had an abundance of meat
and bread, apart from what they transported. They were
in an agricultural region, and both armies paid liberally.
The only question with sellers was which they should go to.
Cattle and wheat were brought from tremendous dis-
tances in Asia, as soon as speculators got wind of the
gathering of the armies. Now Australia is preparing for
the feeding of an additional 12,000 population in Sydney
and Melbourne. It is understood that the men will come
ashore in batches of 1500 a day. Then there are the
ships to be provisioned. Stores of meat, fowls, vege-
tables, fruit, eggs, etc., will soon agglomerate. Meat will
go up as the Yanks put it down, or store it for the
Jap. voyage, for they won’t be able to get
much siain cow in Japan. The only thing
that bothers a refrigerator to keep fresh for a long voyage
is potatoes. The U.S. fleet could only keep them what
you would call fresh from the U.S. down to Rio. How-
ever, there is a process called hydrating which keeps a
spud agreeable to eat for a long time, and, using this, the
fleet never ran short of murphies. Coal was an anxiety
to the Admirals. The Government provided its colliers,
but there were some miscalculations. Only experience
can tell what sort of a coal-eater a steamer is. One of the
U.S. fleet consumed 20 per cent, more than another ves-
sel of 2000 tons more. Speculation, was on the job again,
and tramp colliers kept the fleet going all right.

DUNEDIN BY THE SEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh ! have you seen Dunedin,
Dunedin by the sea ?
The pride of bay and ocean,
The poor man’s legacy.
Her gowns are deftly woven—
They change consistently—
And she has many lovers
Who woo persistently.
Have you seen Dunedin, when the quaint musicians play,
When the laughing elves of Flora steal glints from dew
and ray ?
Long years ago, one August, whilst musing by the strand,
A jocund wizard kissed her—she woke to fairyland !
Have you seen Dunedin, the proud 10.-e of a king?
A band of loyal courtiers his golden tributes bring ;
Her smile is slow but kindly, and strength of youth is
hers —
The north wind of the morning bears witness’mid the firs.
Have you seen Dunedin in plaintive anguish torn,
Her quivering breast pulsating to vandal’s voice of scorn
“ No need to deck with diamonds where diamonds only
mar ” ?
And pensively she watches each falling, hrown-leaf’d
star!
Have you seen Dunedin ’mid battlements of snow,
A thousand mimic henchmen in long-drawn rank below,
And outposts firm and splendid that scan the distant
main ?
A fierce and jealous warrior wrought these with tears of
pain !
Oh ! come and see Dunedin
(Seek not for loves anew);
The pride of bay and ocean,
The home of shade and dew.
Boast not of scenes romantic,
Speak not of queens to me ;
You have not seen Dunedin,
The Bride-Queen by the Sea !
MAORILAND.

The case of Farmer Pook, of Kyneton
(Vic.), should be pasted in the public or national
or aggregate hat as a warning. Pook came into
«v fortune of, it is said, £30,000, and in the exuber-
ance of his soul, or for some other reason, he put a
cheque for £5OO in the cathedral plate. Then
Pook, who seems to have had loose ideas about
how far money would go, left for London to
devote part of his wealth to “religious and chari-
table purposes.” Plainly, Pook didn’t know
London. London fell on him and snowed him
up. His fame got there ahead of him, and he
found an avalanche of begging letters awaiting
him. The letters made demands that ran to
millions, and they were followed by personal
and written demands for more millions, Pook
realised that he and his bit of money weren’t
a circumstance in this rush. He relieved
the hungry millions of England with about
£250, even as one might throw a penn’orth of
cat’s meat to a pack of wolves, and then
fled back to Victoria, and went out of
the philanthropy business. Next he demanded
his £5OO back from the flabbergasted Cathedral,
speaking of it as money he had “banked
with the Church.” He had, it seems, only
left the coin so that the Church might “mind
it for him” while he had a fly round. And when
the Church looked seriously at the matter, it
found, to its surprise, that Pook had a case.
There was nothing to siiow that the money was a
gift. The church had simply found the cheque in
the plate, and had kept it without inquiry merely
because it was in the habit of keeping things it
found in the plate. In the end, Pook got back
his £5OO, with interest, which sets up quite a new
precedent. Now it will be necessary to paint on
the plate the legend, “ No money returned.”
“ Hamer ” sends his certificate with this
domestic story:—
Some meii find it hard to live, but still harder to die.
One of them lives in a Sydney suburb. Six months ago
he had been in hospital for the previous six months,
under the daily expectation of death. His wife was so
certain about her approaching widowhood that she
assuaged her grief by building her mourning clothes.
Apparently she neglected her other clothes in doing so,
for when an urgent message reached her to go in haste to
the hospital, she hoped for the best and wore her black
garments. At the hospital she found that her husband
had taken a turn for the better—was, in fact, better than
he had been for years.. In <* , oing’ away, she dropped down
in a fit, and was dead in a few hours. Three weeks later,
the widower was sufficiently recovered to leave the hos-
pital, but he seems to have been coldly treated by his
family, and the other day he cut his throat. He didn’t
die, however, and his throat is nearly better : and it
really looks as if he won’t be able to die.

There is one thing the U.S. sailor-man
may be trusted to regard with deep interest in
this country, and that is the dispensing of liquor
by handsome girls. It is difficult for Australians
to realise that there is no Barmaid Problem on the
other side of the Pacific, simply because nobody
dreams there of employing a woman in the beer
capacity. The person engaged is a (usually hard-
faced) man—a “ bar-tender.” (It is a standing
Western joke for any travelling British baronet,
who makes play with the “ Bart.”
after his name, to be asked if it is
short for the other word.) How
completely foreign the barmaid
i -lea is to the Yank mind may
bo gathered from a recent cartoon
in N.Y. Puck. It was directed
against the modern woman who
smokes, and it asks why she doesn’t
also drink, gamble, and go the
Total Hog. It pictures a big down-
town saloon filled with female
sports, and it introduces, as a set-
off, women behind the bar, evi-
regarding them as the last
straw in the way of impossibility.
When Jonathan finds the woman
behind the bar regarded as a
matter of course, he will drop his jaw and his
cocktail in simultaneous horror.

Some of the ill-regulated public hospitals
° f X ic^ oria have latel y been getting a bad raking.
A Melbourne man, who attended the Alfred Hos-
pital with a lacerated finger, was allowed to sit
nuismg his injury in the casualty room for over an
hour, and had finally to depart without seeing a
doctor, after his wound had been dressed by the
hall-porter. Maldon’s hospital has been con-
demned holus-bolus by the Health Department
but still jogs along in the old shiftless fashion. It
suffers from insufficient ventilation, deficiency
of lighting, overcrowding, bad drainage, and an
unwholesome condition generally”; but still no-
thing is done. The Daylesford institution also
has been under consideration. A South Melbourne
visitor wrote to the local paper describing Dayles-
ford’s invalids as “wrecks of humanity in cold,
damp cells, with insufficient food and utter lack of
attention.” The committee boiled overat that, and
sued the lady for slander. According to the
evidence, she seemed to have been misled, and
Judge Eagleson gave the committee a verdict for
the ; but there was talk of an appeal
to the Supieme Court, and the committee com-
promised on a verdict of Is., each side to pay its
own Costs. But, m spite of the committee’s
nominal victory, sworn evidence was given of
bad and insufficient food; of paralysed patients
being left without attention and having to be
taken away by their friends; of a convalescent
patient being given a bit of dry bread for supper
after a day’s washing ; of a blind Chinese having
to lie for days m a “ cell ” with a bare, brick floor,
damp and mildewed ; and of another, suffering
from cancer, whose only attendant was a patient.
One of the hospital committee’s witnesses was
ingenuous, if callous ; lie said he “ would not care
to lie in such a place if he had means to get a
better, but it was right enough for that class of
persons.” After which it will probably be admitted
that the hospital is quite as good as one could
expect it to be, judging by the sort of people the
committeemen rely upon when they need de-
fending.

“Maitai”: Maoriland’s brown man has
just concluded, at Wellington (M.L.), a week’s
conference, run on mixed white and brown prin-
ciples. Its purpose was to herd the various tribes
(many of them are not on speaking terms) into a
huge, saddle-colored brotherhood, and to wrestle
with schemes for the general betterment and up-
lifting of the Maori. Over 200 delegates attended.
Ihe results of the great “korero” are figured out
as satisfactory. Mrs. Stout, wife of Maoriland’s
Chief Justice, looked for a little prominence at
the congress. She wrote to the brown man
assembled about a scheme whereby the domestic
help trouble was to be solved by running the
Maori maiden into the kitchen and back-yard
environment. But the tattooed father replied
briefly that the shapely-limbed maiden was busy
at present looking after his comfort, and he didn’t
want to do his own house-work, and the girl had
plenty of work without boiling the kettle of the
pa e oppressor. After all, the only solution of
the servant-girl difficulty seems to be polygamy.

In the N.S.W. Assembly the other even-
ing Carmichael made Treasurer Waddell angry
by asking whether, as the fund for the reward of
the loyal’ tram-drivers didn’t seem to be mount-
ing up very fast, the Government would strike a
medal as a badge and a reward for the “loyalists.”
But Carmichael was wrong. There are only
about 400 “loyalists” to be rewarded. The Em-
ployers’ Federation gave £5OO, and Sydney Stock
Exchange 100 guineas ; and that makes up the
necessary thirty pieces of silver for each of the
400.

“ Harrison O.” writes from Geelong, in
Victoria (this thing appears just as he wrote it):—
Nobody who is not a resident of Geelong can realize
what a Great Awakening has happened in that sonambu-
listic hamlet since The Unspeakable Tiling' which haunts
Mr. Gnash (late shepherd of the Christ Church, Geelong,
flock) first made its appearance there. All the Geelong
sheep have become absurdly agitated, and mild old
gentlemen whom nobody ever suspected could do any-
thing except snore and read the newspapers, have sud-
denly become furious like a woman scorned or some such
thing, and have taken to making lurid speeches of the
Sprucei Mythian type. And the collective Lady of the con-
gregation sometimes heaves a heavy sigh but more often
she hops around the place with a sterotyped grin and a col-
lection box soliciting contributions to the “ Nash Defence
Fund.’’ Furious meetings are held and bloodthirsty
orations are delivered to the accompaniment of much
frantic gesticulation and everyone abuses Gaiters Clarke
and blesses “ ower-r dear-r bruther-r” (meaning Gnash)
and then they offer up 1 or 2 prayers and sing “ Onward
Christian Soldiers” or some such song and after the Chair-
man has announced that they will meet to-morrow night
and have a whole lot more “ Christian Soldiers ” and pass
fresh terrible resolutions, they wend their way homeward
and after a glass of milk and a piece of cheese, go to bed.
Then during the next day they learn some brand-new
adjectives and at night they meet and do it all over
again—Only more so. One action upon the part of Gnash’s
Geelong friends struck me however as being distinctly
neat; the Christ Church people have repeatedly nomi-
nated Gnash for the job of parson of the church, which
billet he held before The Unspeakable Thing made its
appearance upon the scene, the nomination has been
vetoed by Clarke and his underlings with monotonous
regularity, so the other night the Chief Blitherers or
whatever they call themselves, of the church met and
reduced the parson’s screw from £350 to £lOO per annum.
Up to now the vacancy created by retirement of Mr.
Nash, has not been filled, and of course no bloke is
likely to take on the job of Soul Saver (especially as the
souls concerned are haughty Anglican ones) at a paltry
two quid a week, only a very inferior make of soul could
be saved at such a price and the congregation of Christ
Church, Geelong, is made up of “ The Very Best People,”
but the Grand Bosses of the tabernacle refuse to offer a
larger screw to anybody except their own beloved Mr.
Gnash. In fact things at present are in a state of con-
tinual eruption which is very humorous to an impartial
observer, but an indignation meeting held at the Christ
Church school hall is certainly worth attending. I have
been there and it is far more exciting than a baby show—
or even a baby when it happens at the next door

A GOOD AUSTRALIAN.
“ Why didn't you put your penny in the plate
this morning!”
“ Because it was a foreign mission, and dada
says it’s not right to send capital out of the
country.”
Deadwood Dick produced three more
aspirants for glory at Werribee (Vic.) just lately.
The trio of desperadoes took to the road with two
revolvers, two masks, and some rounds of ammu-
nition. Thereupon the die was cast, and a life of
fearsome danger was entered upon. They held
up a horse and pony in broad daylight, and were
riding off, fierce and debonair, when they were
pursued by an enraged farm-hand from whom
they had cadged a feed. Then they realised that
they had to make their last stand against over-
whelming odds, and dared their dastardly pursuer
to come on. He did, in face of their weapons—
and argued the point; while a casual stranger,
who was similarly threatened, bolted for his'life.
After a desperate engagement, the brigands
yielded up the vehicle and live stock—by which
time they began to see the dead tameness of a
bushranger’s life. So when a bobby-person
with unpoetical feet took them into custody, they
reckoned that their career had proved a failure.
The Bench, in telling them to be very good and
not do it again, said much to the same effect.
Deadivood Dick literature is specially misleading
in that it makes no provision for such common-
place contingencies as the policeman and the
“ beak.”
REVENGE IS SWEET.
“ Should have thought you'd had enough of Bridge
by this time.”
"But we had to have our revenge."
“Oh, you toon, then?”
“No, ice didn't. They did. We dropped another
fifty.”
The trouble that comes of divided muni-
cipal control over one thoroughfare— i.e., the evil
of fixing a borough boundary line in the middle
of a road—is now being bitterly remarked by a
large majority of ratepayers in St. Kilda and
Prahran (Melbourne). The private house resi-
dents of both “cities ” are petitioning their re-
spective councillors to combine in supplying a
tramway service for the spacious district of
Dandenong-road. Also, most of the shopkeepers
in Prahran (whose name is legion)
are favorable to the project,
whereas the comparatively few
traders in St. Kilda object to
their council providing the local
nobility and gentry with a new
facility for “ going shopping ”
in the rival city. Again, there
is the question of another tram
line to be laid along High-street,
Prahran, and the local council
would rather safeguard the
financial interests of its own
particular line, running into the
heart of its city, than combine
with the rival council in con-
structing a tramway for the
dividing road. So the ratepayers
in general cttn only curse the conflict of interests,
and pray at intervals.

The cumbersome and almost-moribund
Melbourne Board of Shirks lately voted itself
£6O to be spent on gold badges for its several and
separate bingies, so that all the world might know
incompetence by this mark. The members have
not yet voted themselves a motor car apiece ; but
why not? They have just as much right to spend
£3OO of public money on each other as they have
to spend £3.

lb is good to read that the Clerks’ Union
of N.S.W. held its meeting the other even-
ing at the Trades Hall, Sydney, and communi-
cated with the Parliamentary Labor Party
on certain matters, and expressed its sym-
pathy with the Tramway Union in its recent
troubles, and drew up a log of wages and
working conditions. That sort of thing signi-
fies that clerkdom is finding its feet, and is
learning that it is a worker and needn’t be
ashamed to combine with other workers for mutual
protection and assistance. When it has fully
iearned its lesson clerkdom will be a power. For
a long time its contempt for its fellow-toiler who
airily flourished a pick and shovel kept it isolated
and helpless, and its boss took full advantage of
its isolation, and told it to come back after tea
and work like Sheol till 10 p.m. without overtime
pay. But the time is in sight when that kind of
employer will be surprised to find the clerical
sheep turn round on him and bite him ; and then
he will say sorrowfully that things are not what
they were, which will be a true statement, seeing
that they never are, and it is a mighty good thing
for the world that they are not.
The lafce C. C. King-
ston’s Jaw office naturally
didn’t have a very large or
profitable “ commercial ” con-
nection—the principal’s poli-
tics barred that—but there
was one business that stayed
in his hands from the time
his father died until his own
death ; and now it has been
passed on to H. A. Parsons,
the son of an old political
opponent of his. There is a
romance about the whole
business. At school in Eng-
land “ Paddy ” Kingston had
two chums, named Thorn-
gate, who afterwards kept a
grocer’s shop near Ports-
mouth. When Kingston left
for S. Australia with the
pioneers—he was a surveyor
at that time —the two broth-
ers gave him £5OO to invrst
for them in land; and
Kingston, who had the job
of surveying the town site
of Adelaide, got for his old
schoolmates a couple of acres
in Rundle-street, about 130
acres of suburban land, and
some country blocks. Rundle-
street later on became the
principal business thorough-
fare. The brothers never
married, but before they died
they fixed up a trust (the
trustees were the local town
clerk and their storeman),
and arranged that the pro-
ceeds from the estate they
had never seen should be
used for various charitable
purposes—not in S. Aus., un-
fortunately, but mostly in
their own neighborhood.
Surveyor Kingston repre-
sented them in Australia while he lived; and
then C.C. succeeded him. The annual revenue
is supposed to be somewhere in the neigh-
borhood of £20,000; but as there were also
English properties, the maintenance of the Thorn-
gate charities doesn’t call for anything like that
amount, and the balance goes to the trustees and
their families. The Thorngate brothers were
well-meaning grocers, no doubt; but they would
have been fairer grocers if they had sent the un-
earned increment back whence it came. As a
matter of fact, it seems that all S. Aus. gets of
the revenue is a poor little £lOO a year, which is
paid to the Bishop of Adelaide.
“ Shark ” writes :
The crimson thread of empire is a very attenuated liga-
ture compared with the hawser of clannishness (or free-
masonry) which binds the sea captain to his fellow-shell-
back when his fellow-shellback’s ticket is in danger.
About the only oath that has never been taken in col-
lision cases is one to the effect that neither of the
colliding vessels was on the spot at the time. Scores
of coasting skippers can ttll (anywhere outside the court)
of a coasting steamer, then about two years old, which
was coming down the shoal waters of a coast (not speci-
fied herein for obvious reasons). She was a bit deep aft
and the order was given to fill the for’ard tanks to trim
ship. So the donkey-engine was set going at the rate of
about 40 tons per hour, and it was forgotten and left
going until the skipper saw water spurting out of the
ship s side. Nothing was said ; the ship was repaired at
Mort’s Dock, and the accident went into the list of the
mysteries of the sea. Of course, there was an inquiry
but the lack of evidence was something incredible!
Skippers tell this yarn even unto the. present day, but
not at the court.
THE DISADVANTAGE OF BEING A SAINT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Elder William Mackie, pastor of the Latter Day Saints,
who mysteriously disappeared from the midst of his flock
in Melbourne on June 18, was discovered in a barber’s
shop at Balmain yesterday by Detectives Darlington,
Vincent, Murdoch, and Buzzacott, and arrested on a pro-
visional warrant for wife desertion. Thq elder had under-
gone a considerable change in appearance since his depart-
ure from Melbourne, but he was recognised despite the
absence of beard and the presence of a hair-trimmer’s
garb.— Sydney D. Telegraph, SIJ7I’OB.
An Elder who goes forth upon a burst,
Labors beneath a crushing handicap;
He is, as ’twere, by his own virture cursed ;
His very godliness ensures mishap.
It is of absolutely no avail
For him to lay bis saintly clothes aside,
And put on others. All such schemes must fail—
No cloth can hide the angel wings inside.
What though he reap his white chin-whiskering
(Insignium of purity) ? Woe’s me !
The odor of the shaving-soap won’t cling:
’Tis straightway drowned by that of sanctity.
Let him put on what mask he likes, to go
To bars and other spots where people sin ;
He may not mask the bright and soulful glow
That issues from the Holy Light within.
A beacon he ! Even the big John Dunn
In his case finds it hard the case to mull ;
The sleuths arrest him e’er his sport’s begun—
They spot him by the halo o’er his skull.

The money required to finance this State Land Bank —
officially known as the] Government Advances to Settlers
Office —has been provided by floating loans at 3 per cent.,
redeemable in 1945. In order to get the advantage of
this very low rate of interest, the loans had to be
accepted at the heavy discounts shown above. At April 1,
1898, when the foregoing- table opens, the total indebted-
ness, or paper assets, of this sort, amounted to £105,897,
and there was also a profit and loss debit of £5276 ; total,
£111,173. Since then other loans have been floated on
terms by w'hich the office undertook to repay £102,569
more than it actually received. Now, all those discounts
have been wiped out. Ten years’ operations have given
this result

It will be observed that there has been a long jump in the
matter of expenses during the past year. For this the
items “clerical assistance” and “Valuation Depart-
ment” are mainly responsible. Something over 12
months ago the bank undertook to prepare and complete
mortgages at a total cost of ss. each ; and, though it is
said that much labor and expense will be saved to the
department by this plan, it seems more probable that
that saving hasn’t shown up yet. No doubt, however,
the main cause of the increase in management costs has
been the unusually large number of new loan transac-
tions. Advances granted totalled 2371, as against 1929
in 1907 and 1707 in 1906.
The bank now owes £4,110,000 of principal.
Against that it has, as shown above, only £81,097 of
reserves. In ordinary banking practice it is judged im-
prudent if the depositors and other creditors are not
safeguarded to the extent of £1 of the bank’s own
funds to £7 of the public’s. As all this bank’s
funds are in mortgages, w'hich are liable to severe
fluctuations in value, that proportion is certainly
not excessive for such an institution as this. That being
so, the bank should not rest until it has reserves of well
over £500,000, even presuming that the advances do not
mount any higher. At the present time its own funds do
not represent quite 2 per cent, of its risks. That is to
say, if the Maoriland land values slumped more than
2 per cent, below the amounts which the bank has
advanced, the bank would show a loss of capital which
the State would have to make up. There is no reason
why, with the low rate of interest paid for its working
capital, reserves should not now be rapidly accumulated ;
and until they are accumulated any further substantial
concessions to borrowers should be resolutely refused.
The future of Maoriland land values is very uncertain.
The chances are that, when the inflow of loan money
stops—or, father, when the Dominion is obliged
to pay the interest on past loans out of current produc-
tion instead of out of new loans —there will be a painful
awakening. Artificial conditions have been created by
the insane policy of excessive borrowing, and when some
accident pricks the bladder there very likely will be
serious trouble. And every Maoriland concern that deals
in mortgages and wants to escape disaster will make
steady provision against the time when the highly
probable accident will happen to the bladder.
In 1900 anew branch of the M.L. State Land
Bank was created by the Advances to Workers Act, the
object being to assist city workers to become their own
landlords. To March, 1907, there was a loss of £434 ; for
the past year a further loss of £228. Practically, how-
ever, these losses are preliminary expenses: more than
the total is represented by interest on loans raised by the
bank to provide for the advances applied or to be applied
for. At March 31, 1907, the advances completed were
£5490 ; they have now reached £203,143. In all 1179
advances have been authorised, on the same liberal terms
regarding interest and repayment as apply to the advances
to settlers. The interest is 5 per cent., reducible to 4£ per
cent.

This co. reconstructed in 1884, and then began to boom
ahead Starting with a capital of £125,000, it had run
the total up to £250,000 by 1890-an easy enough job,
because divs. had been also run up from 8 to 12 per cent.,
and everything in the garden was lovel} r . As for local
deposits, it scarcely wanted them ; instead, it sought
money on debentures in London and Scotland, and got,
approximately, £900,000. The debenture borrowings
■were limited to the amount of uncalled capital; and
when it wanted more debentures, to raise money for
loans on Melbourne boom-valued properties, it issued
more shares, paying up £1 and making shareholders
liable for another £4. Then the trouble happened. The
struggle to get the calls in was almost pathetic. To-day,
of the 250,000 shares only 146,215 are left ; even last half-
year, lifter all these years of call-paying, 407 were for-
feited. The shares have been written down nominally to
£2 10s., and only £1 10s. remains uncalled on them.
There are heavy arrears of calls still on the books, and
more forfeitures are therefore probable.
In the cleaning up a year or so ago a contin-
gency account of £29,901 was left —at least, that was
shown in the balance sheet as at December 31, 1907.
That account now stands at £31,800.; so it has been
assumed in the foregoing table that the difference is the
profit or surplus which the realised properties ha,ve
realised over and above written-down values. On ordin-
ary trading a profit of £1118 was shown, after allowing
for £570 discount on calls paid in advance. Apparently
the realisation has been proceeding fairly well. Take
some comparisons :—

Cash, etc. .. 43,010 128,188 38,798 70,629
Another little lot of debentures will be shortly retired
with the money in hand. The half-year’s gross income
was £11,490. That means an average of £4 19s. per cent,
on the total assets —which isn’t high enough to suggest
that there has been much under-valuation, at any rate.
Still, of the £112,551 of properties, a quantity may be unpro-
ductive vacant lands. Everything, of course, depends upon
the valuations. If they are all right, then the remaining
capital is all right. Advances and properties, lumped
together, now stand in the books at £392,323 ; the other
assets are liquid. If the re-valued assets only realise two-
thirds of the valuation, they would still (with the liquid
assets) produce more than the entire debt; and it would
be a shocking over-valuation if the realisation panned out
as bad as that. The debenture debt has been renewed
from time to time: 12 months ago it was renewed for
five years, on condition that 10s. was called up: 5s.
of that has already been called, but £28,643 was still un-
paid on June 30. The debentures (which are due five
years hence) carry only 31 per cent, interest, and that
fact has to be remembered in considering the recent
trading profits and the co.’s possibilities as to profit in
the future.

The old co. was in 60,000 shares. When the present co.
was formed, in 1899, each old £1 share was exchanged for
two new £1 shares. That made 120,000, half of which
were “ water.” Then 20,000 more were issued at par.
Next 20,000 were issued as bonus shares. And finally, 12
months ago, 40,000 were issued, 10s. being called up.
One lot of Sydney investors rushed these new shares to
49s., fully expecting that the co. would pay up the other
10s. out of profits. But they made a mistake—the
directors “ have decided to call up the balance of un-
called capital (10s. per share) on the 40,000 new shares,
which will be made payable on Oct. 1, and will carry
dividend from that date.” At the present 42s. for these
shares, the return when the other 10s. is paid will be
slightly under £3 17s. per cent. Either investors don’t go
into figures or they believe that there are still new issues
of shares or increased dividends ahead. The authorised
capital of t he co. is, however, only £200,000, and the present
call will make up that amount. Still that isn t an in-
superable obstacle. The co. got over the difficulty once
before by turning itself into a new concern, and that way
is still open. The situation at present is that the man
who held 60 shares in the old co. at £1 each (par) now
holds 200 shares, which will have cost him £120 when the
forthcoming 10s. is paid ; and the 10 per cent, will really
mean in his case 16§ per cent. Even assuming that there
was no “ water” at all in the old co., that 16§ per cent, is
what the present div. really amounts to.
A comparison of some Sydney Ferries’ balance-
sheet items follows

During the past six months the ship-property’s book
value has moved up £1034. But meantime the co. has
bought the Kailoa—the steamer that runs round to the
Spit. Except for £1034, then, the co. has paid for that
steamer out of the past half-year’s takings. In other
words, the amount written off profits ostensibly to cover
depreciation has paid for all repairs and renewals, and,
except for £1034, has bought a new steamer as well.
And, in addition to that, over £1000 has been written off
wharves and waiting rooms, and some further profit-
earning conveniences of the same sort have been provided.
Under those circumstances, the directors will hardly be
accused of over-stating their profits ; and their eagerness
to get in money on which they will no doubt pay 10 per
cent, at once is quite understandable.

This co., whose business is expressed by its title, is now
over 30 years old. Balance-sheets for earlier years are
not available ; but it can be said generally that the
period covered by the table printed on top of this has
been about the most profitable the co. has had. Ten
years ago the dividend was 5 per cent. ; in 1902, 6 per
bent ' and from that point it has steadily climbed up
to9s! perannum on the70s. share(the 12Jpercent, printed
in the table is the nearest handy fraction). Included in the
profits shown above are theadditions to the insurance fund.
That fund stands now at £7148. It is not the best sort
of reserve, being the accumulation of premiums to meet
risks which the co. is still presumably taking upon its
own shoulders. The co. show's no depreciation reserve,
but instead w'rites its property down out of profit. Two
years ago 12 steam tugs and launches, and 19 hulks and
barges were valued in the books at £51,994. The same
navy is now valued at £47,334, so that £4660, plus any-
thing that may have been spent in repairs and additions
during the tw’o years, has been charged direct to profit
and loss. This depreciation charge is represented by
cash or securities, and is available for replacing Or renew-
ing worn-out equipment without reducing the reserves
shown above. Two years ago the cash and other liquid
assets (not including stores) were £7283 in excess of lia-
bilities ; and the £7283 has now grown to £19,255. It is
not certain how the new Outer Harbor at Pt. Adelaide
will affect the co. ; so far, it hasn’t mattered much one
way or the other. But if all the big ocean-going vessels
get into the habit of hitching up to the wharf instead of
lying out from Largs Bay, it looks as though one source
of this co.’s profits will be cut into.

This co. was given a 28 years’ life, after which it has, ac-
cording to law, to hand over its undertaking to the State
free of cost; and 18 years of the 28 have passed. The co. is,
however, manoeuvring to secure a further lease of life, on
condition that it extends its works in some way ; and the
N.S.W. Government is understood to be as favorable to
the idea as Broken Hill is furious about it. The co.
originally had a capital of £200,000 ; but £25,194 of that
was represented by “paper”—it was the price the co.
had to pay various people (that being before the dayslof
payment of members) to get the Bill through and other
rights fixed up. That paper asset has now been wiped
out, and the reserves shown above have been established.
One-fourth of the capital has been paid back : to square
the balance-sheet, the co. has written the assets down.
The past half-year was not so fat as some previous ones,
owing to the slackening off of work at Broken Hill; but
the return on the written-down capital was still at the
rate of £36 12s. per cent, per annum. In the past 2J
years—3o months —the co.’s profits have amounted to
£146,576, or only £3424 less than the total amount of the
capital of the co. That profit is made out of supplying
people with water to drink and for use in their work ! It
is a monstrous scandal, and yet it is alleged that Premier
Wade is being sounded about giving this co. an exten-
sion of time for the further exploitation of the people.
The reserves of the co. are practically all in public securi-
ties and bank deposits ; and all of them are liquid. The
co. has nearly ten years more of life even without any
extension ; and, invested at 4 per cent., the reserves have
now got to the point where they could repay the whole
of the capital at the end of the co.’s 28 years. In other
words, if the reserves are allowed to accumulate, all the
profit from the works for the next ten years is actual
profit. In the past half-year that working profit was
£26,292 ; the balance was drawn from interest.

Profits have thus fallen off a bit, chiefly because, owing to
the slump in wool prices, and the belief that it was only
temporary, many growers decided not to realise at once,
but either to store in Australia, or fill in time by
shipping the clip for sale later on in Europe. Unfortu-
nately, as things have turned out, they haven’t gained
much by that, as the recovery in prices has been very
small, and even then has not been general—a result which
bears out a recent Bulletin forecast that industrial con-
ditions had not improved sufficiently in Europe and
America to make much difference in the wool market.
Anyway, this co.’s profits are less, and the bonus, given
by wav of returned commission, has had to come down
from 30 per cent, to 20 percent. Still the 30 per cent, paid
in 1907 was quite exceptional ; in 1906 the bonus was 25 per
cent, and in 1905 20 per cent. Also it is explained that a
deduction has been made from reserves “ as a contin-
gency for probable depreciation of securities arising from
an unfavorable season.” These securities are probably
those described in a lump as “ sundry debtors ” in the
published balance-sheet. Twelve months ago they stood
at £3l 405 ; now, £25,874. “Advances and charges
against wool shipped to London account” are now', how-
ever, shown separately ; the item stands at £B6ll. Pio-
babl’y there may have been some loss here too. The
other chief asset is warehouse and store property,
£4O 539. It is doubtful whether anything has been
written off this for depreciation ; the total depreciation
charge (furniture and plant included) for the year is £123.
The debts 12 months ago were £24,996 ; they now amount
to £28,763, mostly overdraft. Profit and loss account
affords this comparison :

It is obviously an erratic business; but the co., having
adopted a very careful policy in the matter of dividends
and other disbursements in the rich years, is in an
unusually good position to meet a few poor ones. The
one item in the published accounts which might very well
be made clearer is that lumped “Sundry debtors” already
mentioned. On the face of it it didn’t look an item where
one might expect a heavy shrinkage in value owing to an
only very moderately unfavorable season ; and the fact
that about 10 per cent, of it has been written off causes
an uncomfortable feeling. The nature of this asset
ou«-ht therefore to be more clearly specified.

For five years before the foregoing table opens the co.
paid no dividends, and during that time a large number
of shares W’ere forfeited. Fortunately, when the trouble
happened the co. had a pretty good depreciation re-
serve ; and this has been gradually drawn upon, until in
June, 1907, it was down to £2195. During the past year
there was a change in the wind, and prosperity blew
back a trifle of £ll2 on to this reserve, which, therefore,
now amounts to £2307. Still, though the year’s realisa-
tions apparently resulted in a profit, the hook value of
the whole seems to be in excess of real values; for the net
return is only just 34 per cent., and from that a propor-
tion of the general management expenses has to be
deducted. This comparison shows some of the move-

The new business is profitable ; it yields gross an average
of a shade under 74 per cent., from which it seems fair to
judge that the advances are a sound and live lot. Deposits
show a large increase in the past 10 years ; but they still
don’t amount to one-half the paid capital, irrespective of
the reserves (which are no doubt to some extent nominal
reserves only). Therefore the security of the depositors
is very substantial indeed, and the other liabilities don t
amount to much. In the balance-sheet freehold and lease-
hold properties are lumped together (£15,418). Leaseholds
are a wasting asset, and there is nothing to show that
they are being written down, as they obviously should
be since a lease with five years to run isn’t worth what
it was when it had 25 years ahead of it. The co. may
write its leaseholds down, or the leaseholds may be trifling
in any case, but there is no evidence one way or the
other.

Besides the reserves shown above the co. has £232,227 of
premium capital and a reserve of £19,510 for the replace-
ment of meters. The latter fund has been augmented by
£9672 during the past six months. The co. gives no hint
as to the amount of revenue written off to cover depreci-
ation. If insufficient is written off, then the profits as
shown above are overstated ; on the other hand, it is
possible that more than a fair thing may be written
off—in other words, under cover of a depreciation
charge, the co. may be stuffing undisclosed profits away,
so as to strengthen its position later on when probably
the municipal electric-lighting enterprise will be a more
formidable competitor. The fixed investment (land,
buildings, mains, plant, etc.) stood in the books at
£1,245,330 on December 31 last. Six months previously it
stood at £1,255,262. Provided no land, mains, etc.,
were sold meantime, the co. thus provided out of
revenue, not only for renewals, but also for all extensions
carried out during the six months, and, besides, put away
£9932 to pay for future renewals. The average of the
book value of the “fixed investment” for the past 12
months was £1,254,727. The gross earnings were
£502,663. Thus the gross earnings were £4O Is. 3d. per
cent, of the book value of the plant, mains, etc. For the
12 months to the end of June, 1901, the “ fixed invest-
ment ” averaged £1,092,076, and the total gross revenue
was £354,363, or an average of £32 Bs. lOd. per cent.
From the fact that in seven years the gross earnings of
the plant, mains, and other fixed property have increased
from £32 Bs. lOd. to £4O Is. 3d. per cent., it looks fairly
clear that these properties have been severely written
down ; or, put in another way, it looks fairly clear that a
large sum has been spent out of revenue, and not shown
as profit, to extend the mains and other works. The
stuffing away of profits must, however, stop at some time
or other ; the point must be reached when either divi-
dends must be increased or the price of gas reduced. As
it seems hardly likely that a co. such as this will venture
upon a dividend exceeding 15 per cent., the chances are
that a reduction in the price of gas will come before very

In the past six years the co. has thus paid 57J per cent, in
dividends, or an average of over 9J per cent, per annum ;
it has paid for £142,169 worth of extensions and improve-
ments out of revenue ; and it has, in addition, paid for
repairs, maintenance, and renewals (charged direct to
working expenses). To do all this it has cut into the re-
serves to the extent of only £6371. The result of this
large addition to profit-earning works, paid for out of
profits and not out of capital, has been to
largely increase the earnings, calculated on capital
outlay. In the period July 1, 1900, to June 30,
1901 the mean amount spent on works, and paid
for out of capital was £2,136,033. The gross revenue m
that twelve months was £337,835, or at the rate of .£ls
16s 3d. per cent, on the total outlay charged to capital.
The outlav charged to capital during the past year has
remained unchanged at £2,149,842. The gross revenue
has been £452,453, or at the rate of £2l os. lid.
ner cent, on the capital outlay. Put in another
wav though the shareholders’ funds have only
been drawn upon in the past seven years to
the extent of £13,809, the gross revenue has increased by
£ll4 618. No doubt some of this remarkable growth has
been’due to better times, but a great deal of it has been
due to the large amount of extensions which have been
carried out with money provided by the public—the gas
and coke consuming public. It is a very fine wicket
these gas cos. are playing on.
Going back to 1900. here is another little com-
parison for the Jan.-June terms. The increases shown in
the last column represent the growth between 1900 and
the present: —

Twelve months ago, when a similar comparison was made
for the first time, attention was drawn to the fact that
the cost of purifying the gas—a point upon which Aus-
tralian gas cos. have been very slack—had increased onlj
10'9 per cent., though the gas sales bad increased 30 p.c.
Things are improving in that respect, but there is
still room for improvement. Another striking feature
is the slow growth of wages in the manu-
facturing department. The co.’s share capital is
£857,210 in 171,442 £5 shares. On debentures it owes
£798*000. For some time past the total stood at £848,000 ;
but £IOO,OOO 5 per cents, lately fell due. Half were al-
ready in the co.’s hands ; the other £50,000 was provided
for by the issue of 4 per cents, at par—a saving of £SOO a
year. A further £460,000 of 5 per cents, will fall due
i9lO-’l2, and from all appearances the co. will make
another saving on the renewal of that debt.

been actually spent. Presumably, however, the renewal
fund is a provision for future renewals. Even so it is not
the best sort of a reserve, and it may be only a set-off
against the general decay which is already in progress.
Some revenue may, however, be written off to cover
that general decay; for, though it isn t mentioned
in the accounts, the directors’ report says pro-
vision is made for depreciation, among other things.
Also, “ Works, and apparatus, and landed property,”
which stood at £78,713 six months ago, stand now at only
£78,632 ; but that reduction may possibly be due to sales,
though it isn’t probable. All that. can be said for
certain is that the co. appears to be of the provident sort,
and it doesn’t look at all like a co. that overstates its net
profits. For many years the paid capital stood at about
£25,000. Then, early in the ’nineties, the balance was
called up, and the capital is £45,000 —all that was
authorised. For 10 years 15 per cent, dividends have
been paid ; for many years before that, 12J per cent. It is
a very fine and large return ; but part of the explanation
is that the co. began with a very small capital, and made
the surplus profits provide a large proportion of the
works. Of the reserves over £33,000 is represented by
mains, etc. ; and, besides, there is £24,303 of liquid assets
(not counting stores) in excess of the liabilities to the
public. It is a very solid position indeed.
The first report and accounts of Great Cobar,
Ltd., are in some respect the most extraordinary ever
sent out by J. Bull with regard to an Australian mining
property. Open the balance-sheet and these amazing
“assets” strike you promptly in the eye —“Pre-
liminary expenses, £22,596”; “ underwriting commission,
£144,072”; total £166,669. Even the auditors (and most
London auditors are very tame) couldn’t swallow that
without a little squeal—“ Nothing has been set aside out
of profits to provide for depreciation, preliminary ex-
penses, and underwriting commission.” It means this :
the mine has to struggle to pay dividends on £166,669
which isn’t represented by any assets whatever. The
capital is £750,000 and the debenture debt is £550,000 ; so
every £IOO cost the co. £l3 to raise. And, though last
year was a year of phenomenal metal prices, not a
farthing of this £l3 was written off.
Nor is this Great Cobar’s only offence against
prudent and rational finance. As the auditors’ remark,
nothing has been written off for depreciation. The
directors try to wriggle out of that. They say that the
co., out of the net profits for the financial year 1908 and
for each succeeding year, must put by £IOO,OOO (or as
much of it as the net profits run to) to provide for the
redemption of debentures, and they proceed—“ These
sums, in the opinion of your directors, will provide a full
allowance for depreciation of every description.”
Possibly. But that doesn’t apply to 1907. The fact that
plant is being discarded wholesale proves that there was
heavy depreciation last year; and the balance sheet that
didn’t provide for it is an inflated and unreliable docu-
ment. There was no earthly justification for postponing
the writing-off till 1908 ; the only result was to make the
profit appear a great deal larger than the true profit was.
Again, to further inflate the profit (which for
15 months’ operations is stated at £238,431), development
has been all charged up to capital account. Says consult-
ing engineer Kendall: “Cobar mine.—The principal
work done here was stoping. . . . Chesney mine.—Here,
too, the principal work was stoping.” What development
was done was not charged to working expenses (which
would have had the effect of reducing the profits by the
amount of the outlay), but to capital. No less than
£26,751 was thus added to the capital account during the
period for this work alone. In other words, the co. pro-
ceeded to exhaust its existing reserves without providing,
out of the proceeds, for the opening up of further re-
serves. What can the object of all this be? Whatever
the object, the result is certain enough. An entirely
false idea will be got of the results of the year’s opera-
tions, and no doubt also an entirely fictitious value will
be put upon shares. And, sooner or later, it is pretty
certain that the Australian workmen will have to pay
for it.

The “passing” of a Broken Hill Prop, dividend
didn’t surprise the market, thoug'h two years ago if you
hinted at the possibility of such a thing you were asked
who was crying Stinking Fish now. The half-yearly re-
port isn’t issued .yet, but, by way of preparing the shorn
lamb for the cold blast, it is mentioned in advance that
the half-year’s profit (to the end of May) was £22,750, as
agAinst £308,238 for the corresponding half of 1906-7.
The profit looks smaller than it ought to be. In 1904 the
highest point touched for lead was £l3 2s. 6d., and for
some time the market was a good deal nearer the
minimum of £11; yet the profits (before mak-
ing depreciation charges) for the two 1904 terms
were £126,874 and £158,274. Lead is at present
worth about £l3, and has been more often above than
below that in the six months. If the accounts for the
past term show only £22,750 they will call for some deep
investigation. The prospects of the Broken Hill Prop,
are not very brilliant; that is admitted. But in con-
sidering Broken Hill figures just now it is just as well
to remember that the cos. will shortly begin arguing the
question of wages with their miners and others. The
miners are busy scraping up evidence to show that they
deserve more than they get; quite possibly the cos.—the
big cos. especially—are preparing to show that even
current rates mean bankruptcy.

The lode at the bottom level of the B. H. Pro-
prietary has of late been having a game of hide-and-seek
with the management. After becoming very pbor and
narrow, the ore pinched right out, and the news was not
calculated to steady the nerves of the directors at a
time when they were trying to write in a nice, bold
hand—“ No dividend this quarter.” For a few days
there was a flutter on the mine, but the diamond drill
was called in, and a search made for the missing lode.
After boring a short distance east, the ore was picked up
again ; and on the look of the core it is fairly good stuff, too.
The pinching-out of the ore was a bad sign, and, taken in
conjunction with the experience of Block 10 at its 1465 ft.
level, it seems to point to the likelihood of the Broken
Hill ore bodies proving irregular in the deep levels yet to
be opened up.
• » * *
For some weeks past Block 14 has been doing a
little exploratory work at the south end of the 200 ft. level
with the object of getting a peep at some old carbonate
workings which have been bosomed in silence for some
years. The old south drive has been broken into and
found in good repair, which was a godsend to the manage-
ment, and will save the co. a big sum in connection with
the opening up of this deserted end of the mine. It is not
only the leavings of the earlier-day miners that are being
sought. Reliable evidence is forthcoming that a good
body of carbonates is pitching in from Block 13, where it
was worked out by the B. H. Prop, up to the boundary.
This is an independent body, and, so far as is known, has
not yet been worked by Block 14. The mine is having
better luck with its carbonate than with its sulphide
developments.
* * * *
Broken Hill Block 10 ore body at the 1465 ft.
level has widened from 9ft. to 14ft. in a length of 26ft.
driven, and the assay values have jumped from 12 per-
cent. lead to 26J per cent. The zinc, which right through
Block 10 has been heavy, has dropped to almost nothing,
while the lead value has gone up in proportion. If that
state of things is maintained there will be nothing but
the fineness of grain to complain about, for it is better to ,
have lead than zinc any day ; but up to date the lode has
shown a tendency to bulge and pinch, which, taken in
conjunction with the absence of a defined hanging wall,
points to future difficulties in the mining of the ore.

After spending a considerable sum in erecting
machinery, the Hebrew syndicate which controls the
Barrier, in addition to other properties at Wyalong
(N.S.W.), is meeting with opposition from original
owners, who hold scrip in the new co. This pull-Devil-
pull-baker system is causing trouble, and the syndicate
has already bought out one of the original men. Mean-
while, a reconstruction is mooted, and, with this end in
view, six months’ suspension of labor conditions is to be
requested for the Barrier.
* * * *
Mines Under-Sec. Pittman has been up looking
at the Grafton copper mine, Cangai (N.S. W.). “ The sul-
phide zone, where penetrated, is in lenses of fat ore,
which are very free from bands of silicious material. . . .
In the deepest level, the sulphide ore body at the time of
my visit was being exposed; and the face showed 15ft.,
whicn has since, I understand, been extended to 18ft.,
with no walls showing. This points to the probability of
very large lenses of sulphide ore.” There you have it in
one word—lenses. The ore at Cangai is contained in
irregular, sausage-shaped bodies, lying, it would seem,
horizontally. The co., when it gets ore at 50ft. deep, has
no assurance that it will get it at 100 ft. The correct
estimation of ore reserves is therefore impossible. For a
mine of this character an 18ft. lens is, of course, nothing
exceptional. It doesn’t mean an iSft. lode; it only
means an 18ft. pocket.

Premier Moore (W.A.), in his policy speech at
Bunbury : “ The weight of the gold output to date is
587£ tons, and the total value of the mineral yield is
£84,061,946. The total number of men engaged in mining
during 1907 was 19,113, and the value of the gold won per
man employed was £438 6s. sd. These men are working
on 2508 mining leases, of an area of 61,685 acres, and using
mining machinery valued at £4,000,000. . . . The State
owns and runs 32 batteries and gold-reducing plants, as
well as two tin-dressing plants, of the value of £237,927.
These plants have produced gold to the value of £2,415,672
and 582 tons of black tin up to April 30th last. The divi-
dends paid by gold-mining cos. in 1890 amounted to
£1250, and in 1907 to £1,738,163, whilst the total dividends
to June 30th amounted to £18,199,685. Since the Perth
branch of the Royal Mint was opened in 1899 it has
coined nearly 40 million sovereigns from Westralian gold.”
All .of which is very interesting. But the story ought to
be continued. Notwithstanding all this extraction of
gold (which can’t be extracted twice), and notwithstand-
ing all this vast export of dividends, Westralia has so
utterly failed to gather in a fair amount of taxation that
for each of the past five years it has had a deficit, and the
five deficits amount to £442,747. Meantime, having
allowed the tens of millions to be carted out of the coun-
try, the Government has steadily borrowed some of it
back, and in the past 10 years has given the country’s
I O U for £10,287,784 ; and Premier Moore proposes to
go on giving the country’s I O U as fast as he can get
anyone to cash it.
It was stated (in B. 4/6/’08) that this year may
show a further drop in the Great Fingall output, and the
reduction is coming sooner than was expected. An official
circular issued in London on June 26 says that the present
monthly output of £35,000 is to be pared down on the
advice of the general managers, but how much paring is
to be done is not stated. There are some pillars of high-
grade ore blocked out in the upper workings; and the
impossibility of hacking them out as rapidly as had been
anticipated is the reason given for the reduction. “ In-
ability to maintain the present grade any longer” would
have better expressed the situation. After payment of divi-
dend No. 27 of 2s. 6d. on the 10th inst., the co.’s cash
resources will amount to £IIO,OOO. This includes the
bullion in transit. But as the profits for the next three
months are likely to fall short of the amount required to
pay the next quarterly dividend of 2s. 6d., the co. may
have to dip into this reserve to make up the balance.
In a special report j ust to hand the Hainault
management (W. A.) estimates that there are now 100,000
tons of ore in sight, from which it is reckoned 235. 6d. per
ton should be extracted, exclusive of any values recover-
able in the slimes. Nothing below the 850 ft. level is in-
cluded in this estimate, although it is expected that a
good tonnage of ore will be taken out between that point
and 950 ft. Manager Hay and Hamilton, of the Boulder,
are now putting their heads together to hit on the best
method of dealing with the accumulated slimes, which
are said in the report to amount to 19,000 tons, assaying
9s. 3d. per ton. Twelve months ago this property was
said to have 240,000 tons worth 275. per ton in sight; and,
as the management was positive that expenditure would
not exceed 17s. per ton, shareholders figured on a clear
profit of 10s. per ton. But as the profit earned since then
has been insignificant, and as, despite development work,
the reserves have shrunk nearly two-thirds, faith in ore
estimates isn’t quite so active as it was.
* * tr *
Westralia Mt. Morgans (W.A.) sinks deeper
into the mire. Last year the profit and loss account was
£39,882 to the bad, and now it is £105,821. The balance
sheet shows that there is still £4862 owed by A. E. Morgans
on preference share account; but when other transactions
are taken into account, he actually stands a creditor for
£1067. The Board estimates that from January to June
last the expenditure has exceeded receipts by about
£4OOO. This mine may continue to produce gold for some
time, but it is not likely to earn any more money for
shareholders.

Not content with picking up 2000 acres at
Wangaratta, P. W. Tewksbury has pegged Out 4000
acres in the Ovens Valley (Vic.). This is one “on
the point” for'the Goulbiirn and Ovens Valley farmer.
Tewksbury knows he will have,double-barrelled opposition
to face, so he has started to come-hither before the
chap with the gun pulls the trigger. He wants 250 acres,
first of all, to experiment with, so that he may see
whether he can plant the top loam back on the gravel
after the gravel has been dredged. Fifty acres ought to
show that ; but let that pass. Tewksbury thinks there
is gold worth a million-and-a-quarter hidden in the 4000
acres. His trump card with the farmer is to offer com-
pensation, and to suggest co-operation. Putting working
expenses at two-thirds of the gold, the estimate would
give the clever, self-taught engineer £400,000 to cut up
with his cocky friends. It reads well; but —“ First catch
your bird.”
Pauli,- sitting in judgment on Calder, his suc-
cessor at the South German, Maldon (Vic.), has stirred
up a lot of half-forgotten nastiness. The directors in-
tend to throw another 10-head of stamps into action.
Pauli wants to utilise the money in hand, and; the power
that would be used for crushing, for deep prospecting.
He is right. Nearly every inch of the upper levels of the
mine has been picked over. Sinking is the game, and
capital ought to be put up for it instead of placing re-
liance on the 17,000 tons of stone that are scattered
about in different corners. Calder lets out that the mine
is assayed once a fortnight; yet this is the first hint the
shareholders have had of it, and it is not flattering to the
Board that such a piece of news has reposed up the
official sleeve.

The Caledonia, Warrandyte (Vie.), of which
money-bags Seppy Miller is the chairman, dies far harder
than did the boom of which it was the forerunner. The
country carries small reefs with faults, tight rock inter-
vening. Work has settled the point that the gold peters
as followed down ; so the policy is to poke about in the
upper ground on the chance of hitting a payable shoot.
The £I2OO in hand may see the co. on to a bit of Fatman’s
luck; nevertheless, the public would do better to back
one of Miller’s steeplechasers. The Bulletin sized up
Warrandyte at the start of the rush as a small-party
ground. It sticks to that view.

Rose of Denmark is a lady that bloomed in the
dim past up Gaffney’s Creek way (Vic.), and she has been
shepherded off and on since then. Now some bold Mel-
bourne speculators have the lady under their protection,
believing there is no reason why she should not turn
out to be as kindly in disposition as the newer Dempsey
or some other of the shows at Gaffney’s. All the mines
there are on the dyke and carry floors of quartz, some of
which have rarely been equalled for pocket richness.
Rose of Denmark was once “ bonser” ; and that capital
should be forthcoming to give her another trial is justi-
fied by the history of the mine and the formation to be
dealt with.
* * * *
Glenfine South, Pitfield (Vie.), talks of having a
long shot for State assistance. This is the mine in which
a huge make of quartz was hit while going for the deep
lead, and £IBO,OOO of gold was got from it. In
addition, about £40,000 has come from alluvial. Out
of the lot £68,000 has gone back as dividends. As
about £45,000 has been called up or received in share
premiums, holders have not, however, made much out
of the mine. Asa dividend was paid only 18 months
back, as calls have not been heavy, and as there are men
of the fattest financial type on the Board, the co. can
well hustle on its own, for a while longer, at any rate.
* * * *
The old Lord Nelson, St. Arnaud (Vic.), was a
sad disappointment to many of its over-sanguine backers
last year ; but things have since been on the mend to some
small extent, and mostly the Lord Nelson crowd is one
that can afford to wait. As Chairman Lort Smith told
shareholders, for the first time for a long while the. co.
has a credit balance. The debit on June 30, 1907, was
£4284 ; Dee. 31, 1907, £1643 ; credit on June 30, 1908,
£260. But, though the co. has now crossed the line,
last half-year didn’t have so very much to do
with it; the profit was only £1632, against £3424 in the
previous half, and that isn’t allowing for depreciation
either. In the past half-year only 13,661 tons were
milled, as against 15,177 tons previously ; yet
mine and mill wages ran to £9946, as against
£9938. Shareholders try to keep up their courage
by assuring one another that, though the 1810 ft.
level has been a disappointment, things will be better at
1930 ft. Two winzes are going down to that level : one
has practically arrived, and has carried “payable’’all
the way ; the other, further south, has started in the
same vague sort of stone. To be payable “on its own”
it will have to be better than the 1810 ft. average. The
cyanide plant brought in £2378 over and above wages
and expenses in the past six months, and £2399 in the
previous term ; and deducting those profits from the
total, there isn’t enough left to swear by. And the
cyanide profits are not all profits either, because from its
very nature the cost of this plant ought to be written
down steadily ; and no writing down has been done.
* * * *
The Porepunkah, one of the younger Bright
(Vic.) dredges—the co. is now 18 months old—made a
profit of £IOO6 last six months, and has got its liabilities
down to £5918 ; or, deducting cash balances, £4842. Of
the debts £3592 is a contingent liability, £IOOO a year
being payable out of gold proceeds to the landowners.
Some of the co.’s ground is too clayey for good work, but
prospects are fair, and a tight rein is kept on expenses.

The directors of Crown Lyell (Tas.) stalk out
the statement that they were invited by Mount Lyell Cos.
to offer their mine for purchase. However, the big co.
has turned the option down; and at latest some
Johnnie in London was trying to pull the chestnuts
out of the fire there. Now the market is saying plainly
also that Mount Lyell won’t take up the Tasman and
Crown option at ss. 2d. a share.

Another Tasmanian tin co. to pop out a dividend
now and then is New Ruby Flat, near Branxholme. Dry
weather occasionally stops work, though it doesn’t stop
Board fees and other little etceteras. As it is a teetotal
Scotch Board, very few bawbees flow to waste, nor are
many suffered to lie in the till. Therefore the co. ended
the half-year with only £92 cash in hand, though it
had also some tin in stock. This gave £724 alto-
gether to play with, which, being augmented by the tin
since won, lately led to another div. being declared. The
margin is very narrow, and as ground runs about l£lb.,
the Scotchmen on the Board might well hold off divs. for
a while until a bit of a reserve is made up to guard against
a streak of poor wash.

The Bonanza Prop, is a little 2200 share co.
which a while ago set out after the Tasmania Co.’s rich
lode at Beaconsfield, hoping to get it at about 1000 ft. or
thereabouts ; and the chances are so good that £1 shares
have sold up to £l2 10s. Lately a lode formation was cut
off the chamber at 1000 ft., but this is not supposed to be
the real Maclcay. The underlay of the Tasmania lode is
irregular; but, as at 715 ft. (equal to 867 ft. in the
Bonanza) the Tasmania worked the lode up to within
10ft. of the Bonanza boundary, it will be wretched luck if
the little co. doesn’t get what it is after. Still, when it
does get it, the troubles won’t be over ; for with the lode
the co. is bound to strike a flood of water, and, having no
pumping appliances of its own, it will have to part up
something substantial towards the Tasmania’s costs.

Dealing with minerals other than gold, the
half-yearly return to June 30 shows how hard the indus-
try has been hit in Queensland by the slump in metals —
• or, to be more accurate, what a dazzling time the fields
had in the boom. Here are some six-month figures :
Jan.-June, 1907. Jan.-June, 1908.
Copper, tons.. 5,821 =£597,569 6,7401 = £394,401
Silver, oz. ..365,294 „ 46,136 469,234 „ 51,547
Tin, tons .. 2,757£ „ 294,608 2,742 „ 194,640
Lead, tons .. 1,860| ~ 34,663 3,002| „ 40,940
Wolfram, tons 318 „ 50,536 123 f „ 10,594
Antimony, tons 351 J ~ 6,551 7 ~ 156
Silver-lead ores alone have increased in both quantity and
value. Although the copper produced for the half-year
has increased by nearly 1000 tons, a drop of £4O in the
market value has made a difference of £200,000 in the
total value of that metal. About three-fourths of the
copper comes from Mount Morgan, Chillagoe, and O.K. ;
and all three have increased their production. On the
other hand, a host of smaller mines have given it best.
Tin shows practically no difference in tonnage, but a
falling-off of £IOO,OOO in value. Wolfram and anti-
mony mining have been neglected by small parties,
former having gone back in price rapidly, though there
has lately been a small recovery. In the aggregate, the
value of the base metal output is £318,346 less than for
the first half of 1907 ; and, during the same period, the
gold output also fell away to the tune of 12,2160 z. fine.
■*•***
Charters Towers is in better heart than for a
long time past. The development in the Brilliant
Extended underlie at about 2700 ft. is a good sign, and now
Pfeiffers, which has the western section of the Day Dawn,
has struck a good reef at the bottom of the underlie
shaft, at 2500 ft. vertical. This make of mineral stone
is 2ft. thick, and carries free gold, and it came into the
shaft on the footwall side. No big increase in
the gold output or dividends can be expected
until these deep levels are available for stoping;
but such good stone underfoot is encouraging.
If Pfeiffers continues to develop well, the en-
richment on the western side of the Day Dawn may
prove just as important as the sensational happenings of
the eastern extension. That such developments should
occur nearly at the same time may seem extraordinary,
particularly when the Brilliant deep levels are also in
form. The excitement about Bonnie Dundee was over-
done, because the main level at 1420 ft. does not
appear as yet to have got payable stone. No. 2 east,
below the Queen Central boundary, is something to goon
with and pay for prospecting. Another level, about 80ft.
below No. 2, is being driven.
* * * *
Mills’ United has more cash than other Char-
ters Towers mining cos.; and shareholders have been
getting dividends at the rate of £70,000 a year, which is
a very bjg share in the total for the field. Crushings
have improved lately ; the last fortnightly return was
1720 tons for £6946. In the face of the cash reserve and
the returns, there must be something the matter with ore
reserves.to account for a sluggish market. No. 13, the
deepest level, ha's a big block of untried ground above it and
in towards theN. B. Freehold boundary ; but the workings
above No. 10 seem to indicate that practically anew shoot
will have to be found if No. 13 is to be much good.
The shallow levels, No. 5 and No. 6, are of interest
to the E. Mexican, and some arrangement will probably
be come to between the two cos. The E. Mexican is as
yet an unproved proposition, and the failure to find pay-
able stone on towards the Mexican boundary was a great
slip-up to the market. But at that time" the idea of
another shoot was not entertained; and since then one
has been proved for about 300 ft. in length and only 90ft.
below the Mexican’s northern boundary. In theory, the
E. Mexican should get the shoot under the allotments it
bought, which partly justifies the run on shares.

Miner: But, then, you see he said he didn’t
want any information ; so the bottom falls out of the
argument F.M.L. : The chances are that Sydney bank
will have to stand the loss, in which case increased divs.
for some time are out of the question Roeburn : Don’t
touch it Metal: According to last “Official Year
Book ” (1907), the total mineral output was—Victoria,
£279,024,207 ; N.S.W., £170,808,155.
Leaving Cairns (Q.), the other day, the Wodonga
took 198 tons silver-lead ore, 17 tons copper ore, 20
tons ingot tin, 6 tons wolfram, 3cwt. bismuth ore, and
178 tons blister copper—and these are bad times in the
North ! All the same, it is a pity to see the raw ore
going away from the district; No dotibt the Molloy
smelter will do the long-expected some day, and will
absorb most of the raw material which the Chillagoe Cos.
doesn’t catch higher up the line.

“ Groper ” : The toughest thing in horse-
flesh is the Westralian brumby. You can’t knock
him out. He’ll go all day and all night, and be
round next morning looking for work. Many
farmers use him for ploughing, and seem to get
on as quickly as anyone else. Have two that in a
case of necessity put up something of a record.
Ran them in off the grass and went 40 miles to
town ; back next day with a passenger ; next two
days the brumbies were ridden all day ; fifth day
they went back to town; sixth day they came
home again. Not bad for a couple of runts about
13 hands high. The home of the brumby is in the
Western districts, chiefly along the Blackwood
river. They are sprung from thoroughbred
stock, but have inbred to such a degree that they
have deteriorated greatly in size, though they
still retain the spirit of their forebears. Breeders
run them down at the end of the summer —not a
very difficult job, for brum has been topping up
on poison plant, owing to scarcity of grass, and
with that vegetable in him, he only runs about a
couple of miles. Brumby’s selling value (un-
broken) is anything from 30s. to £5, but I have
seen a pair, after breaking, fetch £22. The only
thing that can beat them for hardness is the heart
of an Anti-Sosh cocky.
SILVER THREADS AMONG THE GOLD.
ANCIENT PICK PUSHER : “ Any charnce up at the
mine, boss?"
YOUTHFUL MANAGER: “ No, we ain’t running an
old men’s dep6t.”
A.P.P.: “ Oh, it ain’t that. I thought yer might
want a nussmaid while yer mother’s away.”
“Harry Stockdale” : To assist “Mopane”
in boosting up the reputation of the Australian
gee-gee among the burning sands of Africa, I am
anxious that you should place on record the follow-
ing performances—authentic performances—of
Australian horses. They may not be the best,
but they are vouched for by men of integrity and
sobriety, and will certainly take a lot of rubbing
out. Alexander Tolmer, a spare-built man who
occupied the honorable position of Commissioner
of Police in Adelaide, rode his favorite horse,
Bucksfoot, from the police camp on the Coorong
to Campbell House, a distance of 10 miles; thence,
after saying “Good-day,” to Wellington (45
miles), where he remarked that they were having
splendid weather; and after that he trotted along to
Adelaide, a distance of (55 miles, or a total dis-
tance of 120 miles in one day. Bucksfoot was
nearly, if not quite, thoroughbred. In or about
the year 1853 “Cockatoo Jack.” then a mere lad
but now a grey-beard, was sent from Rosebrook
(N.S.W.) on a horse named Sailor, a nag
of high degree and spotless descent, to
Cooma to bring the doctor. The doctor
was out, and “Cockatoo Jack” rode right
on to Queanbeyan, a .distance of 79 miles
from Rosebrook. He might have gone by a
shorter route, but he called at several places on
the way in the vain hope of running a saw-
bones to earth. Eventually he arrived at
Queanbeyan. The doctor and Jack immediately
started for Rosebrook, but five miles out the
doctor’s horse knocked up. He immediately
mounted Sailor, and finished the journey on him.'
This was a full stretch of 158 miles right off the
reel, and the,time was between 26 and 28 hours—
a wonderful trip, considering that Sailor was
grass-fed. Mr. R. Ridge, a squatter of the
N.S.W. Western District, vouches for a perform-
ance by a varminty little nag—-a mere pony in
point of size—which did a run of 110 miles to
Dubbo, was turned out for the night, and was
next day ridden the same distance home. This
performance can be verified by Mr. Bert Pottie,
of the well-known firm of Pottie and Sons, of
Sydney. Mr. Bowden, more vulgarly known
as “Paunchy,” owing to the area of it,
used to ride a big thoroughbred from his
home at Penola (S.A.), a distance of 80 miles,
one day, and home the next, without either man
or horse being knocked up; which was all the
more remarkable as the rider and his saddle
weighed over 21st. on an average. About 1872
I myself possessed a Reubens horse, some 16 years
old, which had been discarded from the Police
Department as worn out. He showed no signs of
being so when I rode him from Maude, on the
Murrumbidgee (N.S. W.), to Hay and back again in
10 hours, with medicine for a sick child. The dis-
tance was 80 miles, and when turned out he
showed no particular signs of distress, save a little
stiffness of action. I was, I admit, the more dis-
tressed of the two, as he was a hard puller. These
are facts, but “ Mopane ” is at liberty to hold the
magnifying glass of patriotism over them for the
purpose of astonishing the natives of Bulawayo.

“ Harry ” : Finnigan kept a shanty on the
main road to Hell. Whenever Mooney, the old,
rum-preserved “character” (or any of the others
who were on the slate), put up a drink, Finnigan
would drop a piece of
raw potato into an old
cigar box. (He couldn’t
read nor write, you see.)
On the shelf he kept a
spud, ready to be cut up
for the purpose ; and
when he’d nicked out 40
bits and dropped them
into the box, or when
he’d got 40 pieces of raw
potato in the box, he’d
take them out and put in
a whole spud. That
meant a pound—it was
east of the Sixpenny
Line. But one drowsy
day, when no thirsty soul
was inside the plain’s
horizon, Finnigan’s pet
pig shadowed into the
bar, gruntless and unbe-
knownst. He got up on
some cases—to look for
a nip. perhaps—knocked
the cigar boxes down,
and made very short and
incidental work of the contents.
“Lulc at thot now ! ’’ said Finni-
gan, when he came in. “The
divvle av a pig has ate me daybook
and lidger.” And he reached for
the bar knife and a large spud
. And a little later the illi-
terate Finnigan might have been seen
(though he took good care that he wasn’t) care-
fully spreading out about a pint of raw potato
chips in a sunny (yet, in a sense, shady) spot, to
fade, for the sake of appearances. The moral
seems to be: Keep up appearances.

“The Prooshan ” : Bush postmasters
have my sympathy. They are expected to know so
many things. J. Brown calls on Monday at the
office and says: “Send my letters up to White
Dog Creek till Fridee; the papers can go down
home for the Missus. I’m ’specting a parcel a
Wensdee; you can send that up to Hogan’s with
their mail. I’ll be over there Wensdee night for
me beef, see?” Miss Shiftabout calls later in the
day and says : “ Mother wants you to keep father’s
letters here on Friday, don’t send ’em up, he’ll
be in; an’ if there’s a parcel from Ragseller and
Co. for Amy, you’ll know it by the tag; and she
wants you to give it to Miss Robins, so’s she can
alter the blouse in it for the darnce.” Next day a
man named Barnett calls. “You sent a letter ’er
mine down t’ Fred Barnett’s last week, and it was
addressed F. Barnett plain as anythin’; that was
for me, Frank Barnett; can’t y’ read English?
An’ if those kids er Gibson’s are goin’ to school up
at the Upper Boga school nex’ week don’t send
none er my letters care of Grady, cuz Gibsons get
Grady’s mail, an’ mother Gibson ain’t goin’ to
’andle my letters.” If a hitch occurs in the carry-
ing-out of all or any of these instructions the local
anti-Federalist hears of it over his beer, and
straightway reels home and grinds out a lachry-
mose epistle anent Federal postal muddlement
for insertion in the press organ of the district.
A RIDICULOUS QUESTION.
DANIEL: “’Are yer gut. the price of a drink on per, Rill, old friend?"
BULL (ferooiously): "Would I be standin' out 'ere if I 'ad?"
“IdaF. D.”: East of the rabbit-proof
fence which runs parallel with the railway line
from Perth to Albany (W.A.), I have often found
“namma” holes referred to by various Abo.-ites.
They are little round holes in the rocks, filled with
water which never sinks and never overflows.
You can bail away all day long with a jam-tim
(which is just about the size of the “nammas ”)
and not lower the level. As to “night-wells,” I
know one on the Ravensthorpe-road, sixty miles
east of Broome Hill. It is in the bed of a salt-
water river. You can get fresh water from it at
anytime. There is another on the rabbit-proof
fence east of Wagin. The strange thing about
these “night wells” is that the water rises every
night to the surface, and sinks about a foot during
the day, The country round is sand-plain, with
gindet-wood scrubs and salmon-gum flats.

“ Itan ” : Bowen (N.Q.), whose progress
has long been cobwebbed by political spiders,
looks like making a move through the sheer force
of its natural ad vantages. Its land-locked
harbor should have been the gateway of
the north - west, including Charters
Towers; but rival influence was too great,
so money was found to wall in part of a
big open bay at 'Townsville, where a few
boats can now berth. Years ago a railway
was started out from Bowen, but for fear
that it might eventually junction with the
north-western system, the work was
stopped short in a thicket, and the ter-
minus remains hidden there. So unprofit-
able was the line in this unfinished state
that it is years since a train did the full
journey. But the help given to the sugar
industry by the Australian Government
is developing large areas near Bowen, and
a very short railway or two will attract
the trade to the right centre. About
BoWen itself fruit and vegetables thrive,
and from there Sydney and Melbourne
draw cucumbers and tomatoes months
before the southern crops are gathered.
Bowen, too, produces tobacco of excellent
flavor, and it is leading North Queens-
land with its cigar leaf industry.
“ Nym ” : Be keeping cod. On the Big
Trickle fish boxes are reckoned the most humane
means of keeping fish alive for market; but it is
a well-known axiom amongst cod-haulers that either
tethering or boxing cod is a risky proceeding from
the fish-eater’s point of view. Fish—especially
cod—pine when detained in any way, and the old
man cod often runs amok when tethered, and his
flesh deteriorates accordingly. Whether it is
pain or fright that drives the old man (or woman)
cod into the lunatic asylum is not certain ; but
several serious cases of illness have been traced to
the eating of mad or deranged or imbecile fish,
though the creature was quite fresh. Perch
(golden and silver) and bream are not so easily
affected, and seem to take their confinement more
philosophically than cod. Alleged records of old
men cod being tethered for weeks at a time are all
beer and moonshine. Cod will live tethered, but
when thus cruelly treated they consume their sur-
plus fat, even when they don’t go crazy. Some
day cod-tetherers and pigeon and starling shooters
will get the same short shrift that is meted out to
those who torture horses, cats, dogs, etc. For a
few pence outlay a wire-netting box, with hoops
at each end to preserve its symmetry,, can be
made, sufficiently large to hold in comfort all the
cod one can catch in a week’s haul.
Language from “ W.H.M.”
Allow me to deal, collectively, with the crowd of know-
alls who assailed my observations on the codfish, with
statements fanciful as a State grievance.
To the aged “ J. Pannikin,” who now contends that
codfish will eat almost anything when tethered, I would
point out that “ W.J.A.,” pleasing liar though he is,
admitted (B. 9/7/’08) that it was necessary to ram the
nutriment down the throat of his now famous Warrego
cod.
“F.S.P.” (B. 23/7/’CB) says that Murray and Darling
fishermen tether fish for weeks pending their dispatch to
Adelaide, where they realise 9d. per lb. To which I
reply : (1) That it is not the practice among fishermen to
tether ordinary-sized fish at all, as it is much more pro-
fitable a,nd convenient to confine them in boxes con-
structed for the purpose ; (2) it is only large occasional
fish that are tethered ; (B) this sort are never worth any-
thing like 9d. a lb.
Among “G. Hard’s ” fishy facts I find (B. 16/7/’OS) that
the cod is not a fighter. Let me inform “G. Hard ” that
among the community of fishermen at Moira Lakes, on
the Big Trickle, it is firmly believed that every deep hole
in the river shelters denizens that it is impossible to land
with hook and line. These monsters often carry away
cross lines as thick as clothes ropes, and snap or straighten
steel hooks that would hold a fair-sized shark.
Really those gentry who go forth with a sixpenny line
and a pot of worms to capture and study Murray cod
make me tired.
KINDRED SPIRITS.
Mr. Price grave an interesting account of his experiences
at a Labor Party dinner he attended in London.
There he met a lady, and in conversation with her he
expressed the opinion that the betterment of the people
would come from the people themselves, and not from
the rich. The lady looked astonished, added the Premier,
and when he came to ask about her, “ Lord, what do you
think I had struck—a Countess.”
“Then I met a fellow with long 1 hair, resembling a
singer, and I found out they did not want him in Russia,
so he is getting a living by honest labor in London. He
was one of those whom Nicholas and his ‘ push ’ told to
get out because he asked for conditions of life not half so
good as you and I enjoy, and because he asked the right
to have a vote to express his opinions on the Government.
And so I went through, meeting all sorts and conditions
of people, and I felt I was bringing kindred spirits
together.” —Daily Paper.

Maoriland Railways.—Prom May 25th, 1908, the

Southland Times.
Loved Maoriland, I scarce can keep from swearing-1
What blatant vandals are in charge of you?
Must change be ever active and unsparing,
Rasing your people, and their language too?
The record rankles like a poisoned stab :
“ Wailcaka station will be called McNab ! ”
What is the matter with Waikaka ? Surely
It is but fitting that a native name
Still should betoken what was Maori purely
Ere white men from their distant North lands came.
Or, if we must re-name the spots we grab,
Does not fair euphony debar McNab?
Born a McNab, it may be deemed a duty
To bear a burden that the spirit rues ;
But, in the blessed cause of grace and beauty,
Is it a title one should lightly choose?
Have you a liking for the dour and drab
That soft Waikaka yields to harsh McNab?
Station McNab ! —where once was “Parrot’sßiver,”
Or something like that, in the Maori sense—
May your obtuse imaginer yet shiver
In Obloquy for his most rank offence !
And be this traced on his sepulchral slab :
“ He sleiv Waikaka to create McNab ! ”

“ John D.” goes fishing : —•
The “H.G.” person who writes (B. 23/7/’08) in denun-
ciation of our local trout, and heatedly classes the “ dis-
reputable character who first placed trout in Australian
streams” with the “rabbit idiot,” the introducer of the
fox, and such like undesirables, appeals to me. I should
admire to know him. He is the class of enthusiast I
revere —one who jettisons scientific fact, reason, veracity,
andall else in the cause of uninformed prejudice. Per-
pend while he discourses :
‘v The trout works off his fightability bv killing other
fish, and he has so far succeeded in this that it takes very
few months to clear the streams he occupies of all the
native fish. The result is that in streams wherein there
were formerly tons of big-, fine-flavored Australian fish
which might to-day have provided hundreds of men with
a living, and added materially to the food supply of the
State, "there are only a few pounds of trout, and these are
looked after at State expense.”
It makes one think that the only trout “H.G.” ever
knew were the sort the metropolitan restaurateur serves
up periodically to unsuspecting townies shortly after the
Dago fishermen have landed a haul of sand mullet down
the coast. Trout only thrive in cold, swift-running
streams of the Snowy River type, or in deep, icy lakes, of a
sort the Commonwealth does not possess, except in Tas-
mania. Australia’s edible fresh-water fish (the Murray
and Macquarie cod, etc.) affect slow-moving, warm rivers.
They spend the perilous days of their infancy in an environ-
ment that would render a trout, if by some accident he
swam into it, too deadly sick to assail a sandfly. Before
trout were introduced there was but one sort of high-class
fish that was ever taken from Monaro and Western Dis-
trict rivers—the fresh-water bream. The latter’s well-
being is not affected by the trout; I caught a number
of bream myself last year, near Oberon (N.S.W.), on the
Duckmaloi—which is an excellent trout stream.
Sometimes (as in parts of the Macquarie) the tempera-
ture, etc., of the water is such that both cod and trout
may live in it. In that case one catches both species of
fish out of the same waterhole, where they flourish and
grow fat in entire amity. I will direct “H.G.,” if he
likes, to a spot within a dozen tfiiles of Bathurst (N.S.W.)
where, at the right season of the year, he may I*and a
rainbow trout (salmo iridens) on a “coachman ” or other
whitish fly towards dusk, and a cod (with a yabbie fora
lure) an hour later. All fish consume fry to a
certain extent, but the trout probably offends
less in this regard than any other eatable denizen
of Australian waters, fresh or salt. His normal diet
consists of flies, grasshoppers, small beetles, and the tiny
cobs of the ti-tree bushes which line most of the rivers
he frequents. When his watery home is “in spate,” he
swallows the worms and grubs that are dislodged from
the river-bank and swept down to him. I have caught
and opened a good many hundred Australian trout in my
time, and never once found traces of fry inside them,
and I make bold to say 99 anglers out of every 100 in this
State have had the same experience. The average repu-
table reference-book will be found to agree with the
“Encyclopaedia Britannica ” (Vol. xxi., ninth edition)
regarding the feeding habits of those of the Salmonidce
which don’t migrate periodically to the sea, viz., that
even in the Cold Country, where insect, etc., life is much
less prolific than in Australia, they live, not on other fish,
but “on insects and their larvae, crustaceans and small
molluscs.”
The fact that our up-country parts'teem with visitors
each succeeding season, in quest of “ the few pounds of
trout ” that have ousted (allegedly) “the tons” of in-
digenous fish that were there before them, is surely the
thinnest argument extant against the: introduction to
these parts of the finest fresh-water fish that swims.

Queensland rum, which has been the basis
of many a Bulletin yarn (and, the wicked
allege, one or two Bulletin “ Aboriginalities”),
isn’t altogether a myth even now. The sugar
mills up north sent 520,000 gallons of molasses to
the distilleries last year, and 223,573 gallons of
rum resulted. Not, of course, that bush rum
necessarily has any connection with molasses.
THE WRONG FACE.
OLD WOMAN : “ Haven’t you slept that

OLD MAN: “All right, old girl! Don’t (hie)

“Henry Phelthatt ” : Young William
Bailup had a home ready, likewise a small herd of
milkers. Old Sorghum’s girl had told him the
old, old lie. Love bourgeoned in his heart, and
besought his male parent’s benison. “Me an’
Liz is thinkin’ er gettin’ leg-roped nex’ church
Sund’y, father,” he said. Bailup, senior, pon-
dered. “You an’ Liz, ay ? ” “ Yairs,” answered
William ; “ s’pose yer don’ mind, do yer ? ” “Oh,
no; I don’ know as I minds. Liz is a strong,
healthy girl, an’ she’s a decent girl, an’, wot’s
more, she’s a great milkin’ girl. No, there ain’t
much wrong with Liz. But wot’s yer hurry, Bill?
They ain’t givin’ much now ; yer don’ want t’ go
t’ th’ expense of a extry hand yet. Let her wait
till the milkin’s heavy, an’ it takes two of yer.
Put her off till the spring.”

BURGLAR (to his son, on visiting day): "No, Jimmy, don't strive for greatness, or fame, or
glory! It's all a delusion. I sometimes wish now I'd never cracked a hank."
“Edyson”: The quaintest pair of brothers
I ever knew were Dan and Dave Hadden, who
held a selection at Ruby Creek, Gippsland (names
and locality are spurious). The two were twins
and very much alike, excepting that Dave was a
harmless idiot while Dan was an ordinarily shrewd,
calm, contained bushman. Dave wore all Dan’s
cast-off clothes, and the neighbors would have
found it difficult to identify the brothers if
it were not for the iunatic’s cheerful loquacity.
Dan worked like a nigger. Dave loafed about
the bush, imitating the birds and beasts.
or sprawled in the shade, and watched
brother Dan puffing and sweating in his
effort to tear a living out of the soil.
Then, if anyone happened to be by,
Dave would remark : “ Ain’t he a blinded
lunertic ? Pore ole Dan, he’s mad. Look
at ’im.” And Dave would go off into
convulsions of laughter. He found
endless amusement in the sight of
Dan toiling over post-holes, tugging
at scrub, or whirling an axe in
conflict with a huge gum. “The
pore beggar,” he said, “he’s
cracked orright.” Then be-
hind his hand he’d whisper :
“ Yeh know, he fills all
them ’oles up agin.” Or:
“ He cuts down them trees,
but the bush is full of ’em
again next day,” Eventu-
ally Dan married, how-
ever, and Mrs. Dan’s in-
fluence served to break up
the happy fraternal partner-
ship. Dave was put into an
asylum. Goschen, a neigh-
bor, went to see him a year
later. Dave greeted his visi-
tor mysteriously. “Hush,”
he said, “don’t call me Dave.
They think I’m Dan here,
poor ole mad Dan, ’n’ they
mustn’t know I’m Dave, or
they’d let me go ’n’ catch Dan,
’n’ it ud break Dan’s heart,
coz he must have trees t’ chop
down, ’n’ there ain’t none here.
I dig holes, ’n’ fill ’em up
again, so ez they’ll think I’m
Dan—pore ole mad Dan. It was
him gettin’ married brought me
here. ’ ’ He looked about anxiously
and added in a whisper : “ They
think it was me!” “But the
pore old fellow hadn’t a laugh left in him,”
said Goschen. “Damned if he don’t think he’s a
martyr, and he’s bearin’ it like one.”

About six months ago a 150-ton whale,
that had a grudge against God’s Own Country,
swam ashore at Okarito (M.L.), and gave up its
87-foot ghost on the beach. The ghost has been
growing every minute since the malignant beast
closed its eyes and folded its tail in its last long
sleep; and now, when the wind blows in from the
sea, it makes a purple smudge in the air that
extends right across the island and far out to sea
on the other side, so that the admiral of the
ketch is struck by it, and staggers on his stout
ship’s quarterdeck. But the skeleton of the evil
monster is valuable from a museum point
of view, and a Wellington man has bought
the stranded disaster, and has started off
in company with three other brave spirits, laden
with gorse knives and powerful disinfectants, to
patiently disinter the enormous bones from the
boggy awfulness that once was blubber. This
scribe wouldn’t so much as prod that whale with
a spear—not even if the whole scientific world
went down on its knees and begged and prayed
him to. Imagine the helpless rage of a ghost
whose tomb is-described in cheap guide-books as
“ the only sepulchre in the world which is haunted
by a whale.”

THE ARRIVAL OF A VICTORIAN STATE GOVERNOR.


London. Wednesday afternoon.—
Responding to the wish of immense
crowds outside the Vildiz Palace,
the Sultan appeared at a window
and addressed the throng. He pro-
mised to ever work for the happi-
ness and security of the people,
and proclaimed a general amnesty
for political offenders.
Verily the world moves I The above
reads like part of the electioneering
speech of an Australian politician.
If Abdul-Hamid would “ say it on
the ’ustins.” he ought to top the
poll.

Tasmanian Parliament proposes that no '
new barmaids be allowed to enter the
business after Ist September. There-
after the bar-girl will become older and
more scarce and more valuable, till, in
30 years time, the last barmaid (aged
56) will attract such a rush of business
that the landlord will be fined for over-
crowding the bar.

infants are now recognised as “property In the* eye of the

Died last week at Toorak (Vic.) A.
McDonald Cooper, who left some hoof-prints
on the surface of finance. Deceased was 65 .years
of age, and, a long while back, was manager of the
Bank of Australasia at Brisbane. Coming to
Melbourne in search of further landscape on
which to implant his boots, he found a congenial
job with Goldsbrough, Mort and Co. as
general manager. Later, in ’9O, he joined the
Melbourne Stock Exchange, but, after a few
years, gave up the pursuit of wild and other cats
to become inspector of the clearing house of the
Melbourne banks. There wasn’t much romance
about his life, but there was money in it.
By the Oldest Inhabitant :
Apropos! Warburton and copper tokens (B. 23/7/’OS).
One of the first tokens issued bore the inscription:
“ Robert Hyde and Co., General Marine, Store, Shippers
of rags, glass and metals, Melbourne.” On the reverse
were the words “ Peace and Plenty,” with a kangaroo and
an emu. In the ’fifties the gullies in and about Mel-
bourne contained a fortune for the industrious picker-up
of trifles. Overloaded amateur diggers started out for
Bendigo or Forest Creek tottering under half-a-ton of
goods and chattels, and threw away a quarter of a ton
before they were fairly clear of the city. The land-
scape was just littered with assets —clothes, boots,
bottles, bedding, etc. Hyde conceived the idea of a
marine store, and at his incitement the first bottle-oh
went forth and gathered up goods and sold them to him.
It proved a profitable industry, and Hyde became an
institution.
"ULYSSES" PRICE.
Premier Price (at Adelaide): On behalf of his wife
and himself he sincerely thanked them. His wife had
stuck to him closer than a limpet all through. She was
with him in London, and went with him to Paris, and kept
him on the right lines. (Laughter.) She was always with
him, and always gave him good advice.
FRENCH SYREN: “’Ow sad! ’M’sicur ’as forget

MR. PRICE (making a dash for wife): “ Mam’zelle
is mistaken. I have never met her before.”

Consider two S. M. Herald cables fx ; v '
‘‘ London,) July! 30th. ■
“There is great anxiety respeeting the-safety of-Sir
William Macgregor, Governor of JftayMuii(llatid, who is
cruising off the Labrador coast, and fjis*_npt (been -heard
of since a great storm three days ago.” ?
“ London,-July 31st.
“Sir William Macgregor is safe.”
The Herald ptiblished both these cables in the same
issue (l/8/’08), which was just about as foolishas the case
of the man who wrote : “ Please return the umbrella I
lent you,” and then added a postscript, “You needn’t
return the umbrella I lent you. I have found it in the
hall. I only thought I lent you the umbrella.” If an
elderly gentleman at the other end of the world goes out
fora blowin his. yacht, and gets home a trifle late for
tea, is there really any-need to pay a cable fiend, 16,000
miles away, to mention the fact? It isn’t an extra-
ordinary thing for an elderly gentleman to get home a
trifle late for tea ; lots of elderly gentlemen get home a
trifle late for tea. In fact, this writer (who is an elderly
gentleman himself) has once or twice got home a trifle
late for breakfast next morning. Why, then, all this
fuss about the Newfoundland elderly gentleman and his
deferred meal ? Blow the elderly gentleman.
Some of old-time gambler Bill Nash’s
money has reached a fund to reward the Sydney
police for their devotion during the recent tram
strike. Old Bill, in the Camperdown Cemetery,
will surely turn in his coffin.
Dr. T. E. F. Seabrook, one of the founders
of the Adelaide University’s Medical School, and
one of its lecturers before it got to the dignity of
imported Professors, died last Saturday. Though
he dearly loved a fight he was a kindly old gentle-
man, who didn’t have the smallest regard for his
fees, and he wouldn’t have made a commereially-
successful practitioner in a thousand years. At
65 or thereabouts he wanted to know a bit more
about leprosy and tropical diseases, so he got
himself appointed Government medical officer at
Port Darwin —which was characteristic of his
thirst for more knowledge.
“ 10-2-4 ” tells a tale of mirth :—-
A quaint citizen, bight R. Mack, seized the opportunity
of the tramway strike to project himself into the public
eye via Sydney Star (26/7/’08). He wrote explaining (1)
that he went on the previous Sunday to the Domain, a
thing he had never done before; (2) that he was fool enough
to go with his new Sunday clothes on and carrying a walk-
ing-stick with a silver top ; (3) someone, while addressing
the crowd, shouted: “Who is this Ivneeshaw?” anil
“Who is this Johnson?” (4) at the first opening Mack
saw he hid his silver-topped walking-stick, and got to the
edge of the crowd and so home. That was Mack’s Sunday
adventure in its entirety. He sallied forth from the arms
of his family brave in his new Sunday clothes
and gloriously clad in a walking-stick with a
silver top ; he got back to tea with the clothes
unsmirched and the silver-topped wand unburgled.
No one attempted to undress him,, covetous of his
gorgeous suiting; no one so lusted for the precious
ore on the end of his bludgeon as to knock Mack down
and seize the bauble. No one even kicked him. Simply,
Mack walked into the crowd and, after a while, walked
out again. It is a trifling incident on which to build a
quarter of a column of marrow-freezing agony anent the
menace of Labor. It would be absorbing to see how Mack
would handle the experience of being run over by a
perambulator propelled by union labor, while wearing
his brand-new sandshoes and his second-best medley of
bogus grinders. In such a case, Mack would bourgeon
forth, one is convinced, as a very horrific and sensational
Mack indeed.

One man who will make a point of seeing
the American fleet is David Thomson, of Fern
Tree Gully, Victoria. David left Glasgow for. the
States in ’55, and, after trimming sails on sundry
windjammers around the Atlantic coast, joined
the Federal Navy in ’6l, and stayed there through
the four years’ unpleasantness. What time the
Monitor was arguing points with the Merrimac,
Thomson was in the frigate Minnesota, Admiral
Groldsburgh’s flagship, a
Wooden, ship-rigged affair
of 3000 tons, with auxili-
ary steam power. She
carried two llin. Dahl-
gren guns, and 50 9in.
smooth-bore muzzle-load-
ers. ran gin g u p to 1500 yd s.,
with solid shot of 1001 b.
weight. Thomson saw
stirring days then, but
a comparatively recent
South Sea experience
aged him more. He was
one of the four saved
from the wreck of the
Corypheus, in the Mar-
shall group the four
who, in a boat 18ft. long,
made the awful voyage of
3000 miles in 47 days.
Thomson gets his grate-
ful country’s pension of
15 dollars a month, and
proposes to interview Admiral Sperry over a little
matter of some prize money he says is still due to
him. But what a gap between the old wooden
Minnesota and the 16,000-ton ironclad of the same
name now on her way here !
The lady who wrote to the Sydney
papers expressing willingness to become a
tram conductor during the strike recalls
the encounter of Dr. Fitzgerald, lately de-
ceased, with an old and garrulous female
in Melbourne. She had an idea that the doctor
had “influence ” which might get her long slab of
a son into the railway service, and taking the slab
and a letter of introduction with her, she called
and held forth vaguely and at great length about
the advantages of being a railway porter. The
doctor cut her short: “ All right, all right, if you
want to be a railway porter, strip and let me
examine you. Here, young fellow, you get out-
side till your turn comes. Strip, madam, strip—
or clear out ! ”
It may be said of most of the recent ap-
pointments to the N.S.W. Upper House that
“there’s no d—d nonsense of merit about them.”
One man. city Mayor Hughes, has, however, done
things. When he got into the Sydney Municipal
Council, 10 years ago, he probed the financial
mysteries and stirred up ugly ghosts which had
apparently been laid for years. His financial-
inquiry committee exposed the writing-off of
rates by influential aldermen and mayors and rich
men’s cliques; and the same committee let in light
on the hushed-up illegal alteration of a District
Court Judge’s final assessment by a Mayor of
Sydney in a back office to oblige an influential
brother alderman and his family. Hughes was
also largely instrumental in getting on the statute
book the present generous franchise, which has
given an impetus to civic life, and has opened up
new fields for democracy; and- he put into being
big services. which were talked about for years
but never accomplished, such as municipal electric
supply. And just at present he has his hands full
with the biggest job Sydney has ever tackled,
viz., the improvement of its worn-out and un-
suitable physical,plan, including the straightening
of some of its crooked streets.
THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEW VICTORIAN GOVERNOR.
“ Come down out of that, y’ drunken foot, or I'll soon fetch yer!"
"Yer can’t! I’m one of the decorations!”
The “well-known Darling Point resident”
who was observed, according to the Sydney
evening papers, collecting tram fares during the
strike on the Ocean-street route (he told the
reporters that “ he might be in his yacht or in his
motor-car, but preferred to do this out of a sense
of public duty”), turns out to be a mere oil-
stained chauffeur. The young man’s master is
away in foreign parts. The surprise of the
haughty residents of Ocean-street and environs on
observing the apparition was not at the Darling
Pointer’s heroism in taking the tram job so much
as at his infernal hide in leaving his employer’s
engines and carburetters and tyres and things (for
attending to which he is paid good money) to
gratify his penchant for playing the Merry
Andrew in public on a street ear.
Whare Paku, a fragile wisp of a Maori,
who weighed anything from 34 to 36 stone, re-
cently petered out at Mahia (M.L.). Whare
was one of a well-known local family of
heavyweights, some of his brothers being also
men of colossal bulk. Rumor has it that
he disorganised the internal economy of
numerous weighing machines, and that he
was far and away the heaviest man in the
Dominion. As no footgear was large enough
to accommodate bis standing apparatus,
Whare went barefooted,’ and it was this
practice which was responsible for his death.
While out- riding his foot was badly chafed
by the stirrup-iron and blood poisoning en-
sued. His coffin was 6ft. long, about 4ft.
wide and 4ft. deep.
Arthur Lucas Harrold has died in London.
Australia had begun to forget him ; yet there was
a time, and that less than 20 years ago, when
Harrold Bros., of which he was head, was a firm-
name w'ell known all over the continent. The
chief was a man of large capacity and larger ideas ;
but he would push into business that he didn’t
know anything at all about—like William
McMillan in grain-dealing. The smash that
followed lifted A. L. Harrold out of Parliament
and into prison. The Law said that his large
ideas were reckless. After that he found life a
hard skirmish ; but his large ideas never left him,
and for three years past he has been battling
(mostly in England) on behalf of a hopeless scheme
to build the Transcontinental (Adelaide-Port
Darwin) railway on land-grant and syndicate
principles.
At a dinner given to Tom Bent by the
Moorabin Shire Council, of which he has been a
member for 40 years, the new knight said that he
was a member of the old Naval Brigade, that he
was the best funner of his day, that he was 'once
Chief Ranger of the Order of Foresters, and that
he didn’t like whisky. These items bring the
reminiscences of Adolphus up to date.

An old Australian miner went under-
ground at Ipoh (Straits Settlements), recently.
He was Captain John Addis, who came to Bal-
larat (Vic.) in 1851, and spent several years root-
ing out the innards of that locality. Later, he did
some more rooting in Tasmania. In the ’Bo’s he
went to the Federated Malay States, and was the
first to introduce puddling machines and other
modern appliances there. He was managing
director of the Sungei Rai Tin Co. at Ipoh, when
the Innumerable Caravan called for him.
A VALETS SPHERE OF USEFULNESS.
Mr. O’Sullivan gave notice that he would move that, in
the opinion of the House, as Dalgely did not seem to be
acceptable to the people of New South Wales as a site for
the Federal Capital, and there was no prospect of a satis-
factory settlement of the question, it was desirable that
-the king should be invited to give a definite decision on
the matter.
“ Bill!”
“ Yes, yer Majesty.”
“ Have you put away my blue alpaca pants?”
“ Yes, yer Majesty.”
“Arid my hat with the three feathers in it?”
“ Yes, yer Majesty.”
“ Well, when you’ve sorted my collars from York’s,
and tidied up the dressing-table, you might
get out my map of Australia, select a capital
for their Commonwealth, and have it sent
immediately to the Colonial Secretary.”
Justice Hodges (Vic.) made record time at
Castlernaine one day last week. The Circuit
Court had one case (embezzlement), and the
accused had pleaded guilty. The Judge left Mel-
bourne in the 12.15 train, and arrived at Castle-
maine at 3.50. He drove straight to the court-
house, and was on the Bench, without wig or
gown, at 3.55. He said the sentence would be two
months, and was off the court premises at 4.6. He
was back at the station by 4.10, and at 4.11 he
caught the return train to Melbourne.
TWO OPTIMISTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Andy Carnegie, multi-millionaire, has been having a
cheerful chat with an interviewer. “ I believe I am the
greatest optimist alive,” says the gilded Scoteh-Ameri-
can. “ I find that every year I take a higher view of
things. I think more and more about humanity, and
have brighter visions of the future. Were I to choose a
motto, it would be, ‘ All is well, since all grows better.’ ”
“ I am a splendid optimist,”
The rich man said ; “ and ever I,
With passioned eloquence, insist
All’s well. Our God is in His sky.
And here is joy. ’Tis sin to mourn,
The sun shines on the golden corn.
“ In dark nights to my faith I cling.
Believing in the coming light.
To nobler heights our world shall swing.
Man grows in beauty, wisdom, might,
And I believe a perfect race
A Paradise on earth will grace.”
The beggar raised his weary head,
Corroding care sat on his brow.
“ Oh, man of millions, I,” he said,
“ Am greater optimist than thou ;
For I’m believing, come what may,
That I shall have a meal to-day ! ”

THE GREAT VICTORIAN ORATOR.

I dreamed. (It was a wild, weird eldritch dream ;
Such as a vengeful sucking-pig might scheme
On one, who, having - feasted far too well,
Blames the poor pig and wishes him at H—11!)
Methought I saw, up-ended on his legs,
Love’s counterpart; whose eyes like frenzied eggs
Boiled, to his boiling brain, above his cheeks . . .
“ Silence,” my neighbor said, “ Sir Thomas Speaks.”
He spoke .. . Such Art! Such splendid pranks of
grace ! . . .
The virile glory of his hirsute face
Shone like a god’s from some high pediment;
And when the people cheered, Sir Thomas Bent.
Anon came one who couched a plumy quill,
Dyed at the point with ink (a full half-gill) ;
Straight for the spouter in his speech immersed
He pushed . . . and with a BANG Sir Thomas Burst! ! !

“From the Old Dog” (Being the
Letters on Politics of the Hon. , ex-Prime
Minister, to his nephew), by Frank Fox, is a book
on polities ; but not a dull book. Quite the
contrary; it is full of wit and humor and apt
illustration. Still, it isn’t merely a funny book.
It deals with the big serious issues as well as the
humorously small issues of politics. It has enough
solid instruction to make it a text-book on Aus-
tralian Radicalism, for on such issues as
“Democracy,” “Titles,” “The Woman Question,”
“White Australia,” “The Asiatic Menace,” it
digs right down to the roots. Within its pages
you’ll get many hours of amusement, of stimulus,
of instruction. If you are interested in Australia,
its racial type, its politics, its social philosophy,
you must read “Fkom The Old Dog.” T. 0.

is 2s. 6d., and you may get it from most book-
sellers, or direct from The Bulletin Office, 214

TO BANISH INDIGESTION.
Sydney Woman Cubed by Dk. Williams’
Pink Pills.
They Make the Stomach Strong Enough to
do its own Work. They Cured a
Sydney Woman who Hadn’t a bit of
Comfort, after eating, for 18 months.
There’s a new way to cure indigestion : a very
common-sense way. Indigestion occurs when the
stomach can’t digest food. That’s because the
stomach is too weak. The simple common-sense.
plan is to tone the stomach, make it strong
enough to do the work that Nature intended it
to do.
The old way to treat indigestion was to give the
patient an aperient or some medicine to help
digest the food. But that was merely relief and
next time required a bigger The stomach
doesn’t get any stronger when anything else is
doing its work.
Now, Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People
are a tonic, a pill that helps to make rich red
blood. Its mission is to so strengthen the system
so that it can depend on itself. Because they
strengthen the stomach they cure indigestion.
When they cure, it’s in earnest. You don’t have
to go on taking them.
A stronger stomach means so much to dyspep-
tics too. Eirst of all, happiness. To the person
with indigestion meal time is simply hateful.
The very smell of food sickens. What little is
eaten doesn’t nourish. It doesn’t even digest.
It seems to lie on the chest like a leaden weight.
It sets up a dull, boring pain between the
shoulders; feeling of oppression; belchings of
wind ; restless nights ; throbbing headaches and
violent heart palpitation.
A weak stomach leaves the face pale and sallow,
It causes the patient to lose flesh until he or she
is little better than a walking ghost. The strength
dwindles away until even light work becomes a
task. All this will disappear when Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills tone the stomach. They have cured
cases of stomach trouble that doctors and specialists
have given up as hopeless. They did this for
Mrs. W. House, 22 Barden Street, Tempe, Sydney.
There’s no reason why they shouldn’t do as much
for any other sufferer. Mrs House writes :
“I used to suffer terribly from indigestion. I
had no pleasure in my meals. I suffered
such pain after eating that I was afraid to
let anything pass my lips. I left off tea and
potatoes, but I got worse every day in spite of all
I did. As sure as I ate a morsel it would lie on
my chest for hours like a stone, and I’d be quite
distended with wind. I’d get such dizzy, sick
headaches that I could hardly see out of my eyes.
I’d think my head was splitting open. I was
very low-spirited. I always thought some trouble
was hanging over me. I lost all my energy.
Very often I’d go and lie down during the day
and leave off any work that I was doing. My
heart would thump so much if I went up stairs or
took a walk that I was fairly convinced that I
had heart disease. I used to feel as if I were
suffocating. I was very sallow. I’d toss about
for hours at night, and when I did drop off I’d
have the most frightful dreams and wake up fit
for nothing. Often in the day I’d get a sick
turn, and the room would seem to spin round and
everything would go dark and I’d have to sit
down at once. I was ailing about 18 months
when I read of patients being cured by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills. Their symptoms were so
exactly like mine that I used to say ‘ Surely if
they were cured I can be.’ Actually the first box
did me a little good. After the second box my
food began to agree with me, and before the
third box was finished I could eat a good meal.
I began to fill out again, and lose that pasty,
sallow look. I felt brighter and more energetic.
I began to sleep well and get up feeling hearty
and clear headed. I was quite changed when I
had finished the fifth box. I could get about my
household duties. I took another box and that
fully completed my cure.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
A MIXED STOCK.
The S. Aus. Labor party has had to make
a change in its leadership. Archibald, who fol-
lowed Price, who followed the much-lamented
McPherson, began to think that he was being re-
garded as a chair-warmer for Price, who
would want his old place back again when the
Premiership turned dog on him; and so he de-
clined to hold the job any longer. But John
Verran, of Moonta, was willing to oblige. There
is a strong bond between Price and Verran ; both
have been enthusiastic cold-tea advocates and
Methody local-preachers for 25 years past.
The N.S.W. land syndicates are pepper-
ing the papers with letters pointing out how much
better it would be to let the syndicates do the
land subdivision. They are tremendously con-
cerned about the frightful debt that the State
will have to incur if it takes on the job. The
purchase of 100,000 acres of Peel River alone, they
say, will cost about half-a-million ; and all the
time the owners are willing to subdivide and sell
—at auction, “ which is a much more satisfactory
method than balloting.” It is—for the moderately
Fat person who wants to grab a few more hundred
or thousand acres. The Peel River 00. adopted
the auction plan hitherto, and about the only
people who had a chance to buy were a handful
of landowners, who in many cases don’t even live
on the land. The ballot may be an unsatisfactory
scheme; but, anyhow, it gets new and landless
settlers on the soil, which the land syndicates’
pretty little auction plan doesn’t.
The same old trouble. The other day the
N.S.W. Government had three bits of land to
dispose of at Moree, and it was struck on the head
with 822 applications, and knocked backward into
the middle of next week. Also one miserable
little block of 75 acres at Byron fetched a rush of
72 applicants. And yet the Sydney Sunday
Times speaks wildly about the necessity for pro-
moting agricultural immigration.
Melbourne Age publishes the astonishing
statement that when the Victorian Water Supply
Department lately called for tenders for a pumping
plant, it accepted an offer of an imported engine at
£13,217, though a locally-made one could have
been procured for £8000; and so many drunk-
looking or incredible-looking or shady-looking
things have been reported of late about Victorian
Government Departments that the statement
seems quite reasonable. In fact, there is a feeling
abroad that Bent’s Government has an ambition
to be as incredible as it knows how, and would
sooner be amazing than respectable any day.
It transpires that Cotter Creek, which is
proposed as the water supply of the suggested W ade-
Carruthers Federal capital at Canberra (N.S.W.),
has its hands full just now. It is flowing into
Barren Jack reservoir, as are also the Good radighee,
Umerallo, Bredbo, Queanbeyan, Molonglo, Yass
and other streams, and it is complained that
Barren Jack isn’t filling as was expected, even
with all these rivers and alleged l'ivers pouring
into it. That makes a cheerful lookout for the
proposed Carruthers-Wade city of Canberra,
which would only have one streak of water to fill
its reservoir while Barren Jack has 10 of them to
make a bit of moisture on its floor. Is there any
water in the famous Cotter Creek, or is it only a
bad joke ?
“D.M.W.,” from Maoriland :
Minister Millar has been telling Maoriland some ex-
citing things about population, and Premier Joe Ward,
confident that the world is going to buy more of our
wool, goes gaily to Cohen with another littie lOD. The
outlook is grim enough. The Dominion is dependent for
continued prosperity on its ability to increase its popula-
tion by large importations from abroad. Fresh people
must be constantly induced to select for a home one of
the most heavily-burdened States in the world, in order
to prevent the debt per head becoming too terrible for
words. Of course if we could borrow £100,000,000 or so
straight away and go on an extended national spree,
it might be all right. Cohen would then be bound
to use his money-bags to defend his own property,
and we—well, we could live on spuds or fern-
root. But, as things are going, we are just
drifting aimlessly into deeper and deeper debt, seeing
darned little for our money, and keeping our, eyes on
Kugby football, cold tea, and roads and bridges. When
a day of reckoning arrives we’ll dance a hdjca, and our
million-booted hoof will be raised to kick Joe Ward into
that outer darkness where Vogel gnashed his teeth and
Stout yammered “Let mein.” But a far wiser policy
would be to begin at once earnestly, reverently, and as
becomes a God-fearing people with a sense of humor, to
kick ourselves.
“D.A.T.” (M.L.) : The thing that
indicates Conservatism’s bankruptcy in
M.L. more than anything else is the
fact that, although a number of old
battlers for Toryism are retiring at the
next election, no young men are coming
forward to fill their places. When its
present supporters pass away Conser-
vatism will pass away too. Candidates
realise they haven’t a hope of getting
in under the reactionary banner nowa-
days. Even Massey and his crowd are
trying to disguise themselves as demo-
crats. The political position is very
similar to what it was 18 years ago,
after the maritime strike, when men
with an income of £lO,OOO a year were
beaten out of sight by workers earning
30s. a week. Meanwhile not the
least diverting feature of M.L. life
these days is the spectacle of the
aged anti-Laborites, who still have
the Parliamentary habit too strong
upon them for retirement, smother-
ing their inner convictions for votes,
and posing as the “red Radical per-
sons” they spurned in their early
days.
» Still another matter has turned
up to show the need for the exten-
sion of the Federal authority. The Nestle’s con-
densed milk people have decided, as
a result of the Australian tariff, to put
up big factories here, and employ
Australian labor at Australian wages.
But the co. is justifiably angry to find
that it must register separately in each
State where it proposes to tin the
finished effort of the bull’s sister, and
that, while the cost of registration will
be £5 in N.S.W. and about £6 in Vic-
toria, it will run to £BOO in Queens-
land ; also, that there are six different
sets of laws re a foreign company
which wishes to acquire land, and
quite a variety of laws as regards
wages and other matters. Naturally,
these misguided foreigners wonder what
we federated for, if this confusion is
to continue, and quite a lot of Aus-
tralians wonder also.
Willie Kelly, M.H.K., tipped
himself light end up, at Kensington
(Sydney), the other night, and spoke a little piece
about the tram strike :
He had heard it said that if the Federal Labor party
had been in power the police would not have been used
in this way to maintain law and order. These were con-
siderations of the gravest moment. It was for them to
think what they would have to expect from a Ministry
holding these views.
Likely enough Willie did hear it said that “ if the
Federal Labor party had been in power,” etc.
Likely enough Willie heard some of his Tory
pals say it; it’s just the sort of fool thing one
would expect from anyone who would take the
trouble to say anything to Willie. But it’s safe
to bet that Willie didn’t hear a Labor man say it,
for the plain reason that the average Labor man
has some sense and education, and knows that
the N.S.W. police are a State-controlled body, and
that a Federal Labor Ministry would have no more
power over one solitary bobby of them all than has
Julius Caesar, who never heard of N.S.W., and is,
moreover, dead. Perhaps Willie didn’t know
that ; also perhaps Willie did know that. In
either case, what does Willie think of himself?
PURE SELFISHNESS.
A deputation from the New South Wales Dental
Association waited upon the Minister for Public Instruc-
tion yesterday, and urged the appointment of paid
dental inspectors to the State public schools.
MINISTER : “I feel very much in favor of grant-
ing your request, more especially on account
of your humane concern as regards the poor
school children .”
HEAD TOOTH-PULLER : “ School children, he
derned! It was the poor dentist we were
thinking of.”
Consider the sort of men the little local
Parliaments get as Ministers. The other day,
farmer and ex-butcher Cameron, Victorian Health
and Public Works chief, told a deputation, which
objected to a neighboring shire establishing
abattoirs on its border, that the Yarra could not
be more polluted than it is at present, and there-
fore it wouldn’t much matter if abattoirs were
put up on the banks of one of its tributaries.
Apparently, if Cameron found his house-drainage
running into his drinking-water supply he would
run the stable-drainage into it too, instead of
trying to keep out the house-drainage.
Bent’s flaxen-haired female —the Victorian
Closer Settlement lady—is making a brief re-
appearance for a few nights only. It was only
recently that Adolphus announced her farewell,
prior to her departure for limbo or Gehenna, and
now here she is back again with the full blaze of
the sun on her freshly-peroxided tresses. To drop
metaphor, Bent has given the Closer Settlement
Board authority to purchase an estate of 4000
acres for a certain price; and the reason given for
this peculiar proceeding is that it is “ a special
case.” That’s all—no names, no particulars,
nuffin ! And why no names, no particulars,
nuffin ?
“Jules Innison ” : One of the jokes of
the present N.S.W. session is the spectacle of
Wade, Wood, and other members of the Tinpot
Party accusing McGowen of being an Australian
Federalist, and the said James McGowen indig-
nantly denying the charge. There is no surer
method of deeply insulting the N.S.W. Labor
leader and his deputy Holman, than to charge
them with being Big—for they are pathetically
jealous in regard to their Littleness, and,
presumably, they lose much precious sleep
watching Wade, lest he should grab their In-
significance when they aren’t looking. But what
a chance McGowen had—and missed—that first
night of the session, to accept Wade’s challenge
and come out as a Big Man prodigiously opposed
to the State Frights crowd. The Labor leader,
however, crumpled up and faded away, and as-
sured everybody that he was still a whole-hog
provincialist, and wouldn’t think of betraying
N.S.W. to the Australian enemy. And Wade
generously forgave him—on the understanding
that he wouldn’t attempt to be Big any more.
Holman then bore testimony to the same effect,
and as I left the House it was still furiously mak-
ing up its mind as to who was the Real Undiluted
18-carat State-Frighter—James McGowen or
Gregory Wade. I haven’t heard the result; but
probably the dishonors are even.
THE THREE.
If the new Board of Trade, proposed by Mr. Deakin,
consisted of three archangels, something might be
achieved, but that commodity was not to be obtained in
Australia. —IRVINE.
And yet even in Australia we COULD fancy a
Board of Trade—as near to archangels as makes
no odds.
“ Quite possibly,” said Sydney Tele-
graph lately in its financial column, “ the year
1912 will see the N.S.W. debt over £100,000,000.”
Evidently the financial editor has no delusions
about the economy of the State’s Deform'Govern-
menl).
The municipal taxation of
unimproved land values in N.S.
Wales lias given a push to the
slumbering movement in S.
Aus. Twenty years ago bril-
liant Paris Nesbit, K.C., who
had the job of drafting the S.
Australian Municipal Corpora-
tions Act, and who inserted a
provision (afterw'ards thrown
out) for that sort of taxation,
was in the front row of the
pushers, and he is there still.
The S. Aus. House of Land-
lords has always been “the
lion in the path”; but, for
the encouragement of the
pushers, Nesbit asks them to
drag up the whole of that
quotation, or none of it at all—
“ The slothful man says there
is a lion in the path.”
Sydney City Council may not be entitled
to a civic Hansard, but there is every reason why
there should be a Municipal Gazette (which
could also be some sort of Hansard) for the
Greater Sydney Council when that body arrives.
Municipalisation on a large scale touches on a
multitude of interests to which the ordinary
privately-owned newspapers will never be friendly,
and in its own defence the Council must issue its
own organ. Financially, it should succeed from
the start. Greater Sydney will have houses and
shops to let, lands to acquire and sell, innumerable
contracts and tenders to call for, and hosts 1 of
jotices to make public, all of which it must pay
for in private journals unless it has a paper of its
own.
THE UNFORTUNATE MA STATE’S WEDDING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Senator Neild, dealing- with the question of Federation,
said that he had warned the people of New South Wales
against hastily entering into an ill-conceived union, but,
he added, the marriage was accomplished, and it re-
mained for them to be loyal to the compact.— Daily
Paper,
Cheer f’r th’ Ma State’s weddin’!
Give ’em a cheer ! ’Ooray I
Look at th’ bride ! she’s blushin’l
Neild, ’e give ’er away ;
’E done ’is jooty by ’er,

No, ’e ain’t got no money—
But ’e ’as got six wives !
Um... Yairs, they may be ’appy,
But th’ rest’s only slives.
Neild, ’e don’t like th’ marriage,

Now, then, they’re in th’ carriage !

There now ! Didn’t I tell yer 1
You remember, o’ corse !
Neild ’e keeps on a-sayin’,
“ There carn’t be no divorce !

Them are the words ’e said.
If that brute was my husband,
My Gawd! I’d kill him dead!
Ain’t it a warnin’ to yer
Never t’ trust a man ?
Lord ! but they’re all crool wretches 1

An’ get yer young ’art broke—

THIRTY-FIFTH REPORT of THE DIRECTORS of

"yOUR DIRECTORS present herewith the duly audited Balance iSheet and Profit and Loss Account for the year
ended 30th June.
The Balance shown after paying- £72,000 in Dividends for the year, making the necessary reserves,
and including £25,991 10s. 2d. brought forward from last year, is £51,507 15 5

The Traffic Receipts are very satisfactory, representing the carrying of five millions more passengers than in the
previous year, and showing an increase of £38,889 12s. sd. During the year the men’s hours of work were under con-
sideration, and the Directors saw their way to reduce them from 60 to 54 per week from Ist January without lessen-
ing their pay. This and the additional traffic have considerably increased the item of wages. Your Directors think
the result of the year’s operations warrants them in giving- a bonus of 10 per cent, on the amount of their salaries to
the Management and Office Staff, as they did not share in the advantages given to the men. Under Clause 65 of the
Articles of Association, two directors, the Hon. ffm. McCulloch, C.M.G., and the Hon. J. M. Pratt, J.P., retire from
office, and offer themselves for re-election. The retiring auditors, Messrs. I. C. Poden and John Bishop, have given
notice that they seek re-election.

I’m the Robur Tea Girl.
You don’t need to be very
particular what sort of a
teapot you use to make your
tea in so long as it isn’t a tin
one—an ordinary common
glazed earthenware teapot like
this is about as good as you
can get, because its thick and
holds the heat and is easily
cleaned—but the tea you put
into the teapot, and the care
you exercise in the brewing of
it, is what makes all the
difference between a good and
a poor cup of tea—if you put in
Robur No. 1 Grade—warm
the teapot first—see that the
water is fresh and just boiling—
let it draw for about 5 minutes
—and then pour it out—you’ll
have a cup of tea that
you’ll smack your lips over,
I’ll warrant —for it really is
delicious tea —good enough tor
the Queen to drink.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, August 4, 1908.
My Dear Arini,—
Miss Rose Scott’s letter to the Herald is the
sanest one in a bunch rushed in by women during
the short, exciting strike. She has only once, in
a long experience of tram-travelling, found a con-
ductor uncivil. Some of the other women’s letters
to the editor argued that all conductors were
porcine persons. Miss Scott says that the un-
happy and ill-advised strike “has been chiefly
brought about by the public themselves, inasmuch
as they do not destroy their tickets (as re-
quested) on leaving the trams.” The public
would do this only on condition of getting
its fare refunded. In contrast to the civility of
the tram men, Miss Scott very often finds mem-
bers of the public unthinking, ill-conditioned and
rude. They don’t make room, or open the doors,
and often they evade payment of their fares.
As for the instance mentioned by Mr. Johnson
about the damosel whom he overheard telling a
friend that “ she never paid fares on this car ; she
just smded at the conductor”—well, the number
of women who believe in the power of the smile—
their own smile—to make men abject must be
pretty considerable. As a matter of fact, a smile
that charms —that lights up and softens the face
—is one of the rarest of possessions in woman
or man. And who cares for a distension of your
catchment area if you can’t thereby exhibit
good teeth ? Not more than one adult person in a
thousand has teeth of his or her own fit for pub-
lication. And, with few exceptions, the acquired
article is like a set of tombstones, such as you see
when the keeper of the sepulchre department has
left the gate open. Some years ago a friend of
mine (she’s got a daisy quilt on her now, so it’s
no hurt to mention this) had to give evidence in
some civil case or other. “What I had to say
was very inconclusive,” she remarked later, “so I
smiled at the Judge, and he gave the decision for
our side.” Perhaps he was dazzled. It was all
gold stuffing that glittered— not her own ivory.
A lot of rain and no trams somewhat diminished
the success of the Centuries Ball in aid of the
Crown-street Women’s Hospital. The Ninth
Century trailed up to make its bow to the
Rawsons, with King Alfred’s wife Elswitha at its
head. Elswitha’s reincarnation was in the person
of Miss J. Marks, a brunette, with jet-black
plaits of hair hanging either side of a face of gem-
like pallor. King Alfred himself and his half
cremated cakes, carried by a buxom lady disguised
as a “neatherd’s wife,” were also amongst those
present. The cakes looked their part very well.
It must have taken the committee some delving
to find how naval architects dressed when the
c dees were burned and Alfred built the first fleet.
There were two of the architectural trade in the
procession and one (Mr. Walter Reeks) on the
floor of the hall. Perhaps he sooled the commit-
tee into having those two petticoated galley
builders in the pageant. Mr. T. H. Kelly, as
Richard 1., of the alleged Lion Heart, was arrayed
in the garb in which Richard Yea-and-Nay went
forth to give Saladin (by the way, why didn’t
someone do Saladin ?) all that was coming
to him. A neck to toe suit of chain-mail,
a smock-frock arrangement of linen over it,
a small shield and a sword comprised the
outfit. The Crusader’s chain-armor was made
at a city shop, and as it weighed 361 b.
“Bertie” couldn’t have had a thistledown time of
it. However, as he saluted the vice-regal pair in the
manner that obtains at Victoria Barracks—that
is, by suddenly raising his sword to the vertical
and scratching his nose with the hilt, then drop-
ping it a steep angle—we were educated (late in
life) up to the fact that Captain Kelly salutes as
did King Richard I.
Some onlookers asserted that Captain Kelly did
a little waggle with his weapon previous to touch-
it against his Stone Age face—made the Sign of
the Cross, in fact; but that couldn’t be, for
Wilson Barrett was not in existence in Richard’s
dav.
The only applause that came from the gallery
was for the Roundhead men and the Puritan
maidens who accompanied them. The audience
evidently liked Fight-the-good-fight-of-Faith
Smith and his daughter Charity. This lot
didn’t look so job as the others. It was sane
and wholesome-looking. When a man has to
make up as a cavalier, for instance, he usually
puts his wig on back to front and raddles his face
like an old ballet-dancer’s countenance, which is
something akin to the back-cloth that the travel-
ling company takes round when it plays “The
Haunted Tea-Caddy.”
Mrs. John Sandes, as Queen Elizabeth, was the
most eye-arresting figure in the Sixteenth Century
gathering, although her attempt at reddening
herself and her hair didn’t make good for the real
Bess. She was escorted by a rather reach-
me-down Shakspeare. And in line was Mrs.
Willy Kelly as Mary Queen of Scots, and
a man named Anzino, who has infested the
Australia for the past three or four years, as Rizzio.
The fascination of Mary Stuart for the fancy dress
frisker is as keen as her charm for the student.
Look up Swinburne’s “ Adieux it Marie Stuart” :
“Love hangs like light about your name As
music round the shell: No heart can take of you
A tame Farewell.” The poet thought her “face
was worth all that a man may think to give on
earth.” In black velvet and pearls and the
coronet-like cap of the Marie Stuart portraits
Mrs. Kelly was justifiable enough in the charac-
ter of the lady with the “sword bright eyes,”
although her coloring was not the red gold of the
Stuart dame. Her sister-in-law, Mrs. T. H.
Kelly, put on the guise of Katherine of Aragon,
the first wife of the greatest English widower on
record.
Wyatt Rawson, the State Governor’s youngest,
did John of Gaunt in black and silver and
turned-up shoe-toes. The youth looks a typical
footballer of the “buck centre” type. Mrs.
George Sly and M!rs. Layton, in the Fifteenth
Century tribe, exploited the dress of the period as it
was in England and France; and the two Hay girls,
ISona and Daisy, looked bewilderingly pretty as
Court ladies, or some such freaks. If a ballot for
the most-admired set had been taken, I believe
the Tenth Century would have won. The Vikings
and the female of their species looked well, and
didn t fall over their feet when bowing or curt-
seying.
J’he N. S. Wales Board of judges (Dr. Nash,
M.L.C., Messrs. W. Macleod, J. Petersen, physi-
cal-culture expert, the editor of Thk Lone Hand,
and your “ Akenehi ”) in The Lone Hand
Beauty Quest, met on Thursday last, and, after
mature consideration, reduced the number of
“possibles” in N. S. Wales to eleven, ten of
whom live in or around Sydney, and one at
Wollongong. The next meeting will be held on
Tuesday, August 18, at Jean’s tea-rooms, George-
street, Sydney. The ladies who are judged to
have the best chance will be asked to attend then
with chaperones, and take afternoon tea, and
abide the final decision. When all the State
winners have been decided a Board will be consti-
tuted for Australasia to make the final judgment.
Tetrazzinis may sing as tunefully as the sera-
phim, but the British Royalties stand to their
Melba still. At her recent appearance in “La
Traviata, ” Edward VII. personally fled to the
coulisses both at the interval and before her great
effort of the evening and hissed in her ear the
kingly equivalent for “Buck up.” This is no
mean feat of friendship in an old gentleman of
Edward’s age and tonnage. One of the “floral
tribute” donors especially mentioned in all the
London papers was Lord “Dick ” Nevill. Melba
has been credited time and oft with a distinct ten-
derness for the amiable Lord “Dick.” Duringber
visit to the Commonwealth in the Tennyson regime
the lengthy social expert did all that aide-de-camp
might to make her comfortable. “ His Majesty,”
he explained, “ had written saying it was the
royal wish that her path should be strewn with
roses.” Lord “Dick” put such vim into therose-
scatteration business that many a local gossip in-
sisted his labors were not wholly altruistic, and
that in certain circumstances he might be inclined
to range himself in matrimony. Melba’s
threatened tour of Australia, in conjunction with
Lord Dick’s appointment at Federal Government
House, will doubtless re-start the old rumors going
at full steam pressure.
The engagement of Lord Villiers and Lady
Cynthia Needham, which was announced last
month, is of interest to various Commonwealth
residents. The lady is a daughter of the Ear] of
Kilmorey, a sprightly Irish; peer who was in these
parts a decade ago. There was no silly pride
about the Earl—especially where the pretty local
girl was concerned. Her he treated, both singly
and in the aggregate, in the most friendly pos-
sible fashion. There are said to be more photo-
graphs of the Earl of Kilmorey scattered about
Sydney drawing-rooms, parlors and so forth, than
of any other human being in all Debrett. Lord
Villiers is the eldest son (and hence the heir) of
N.S.W.’s really truly Jersey. The young man
has shot game—both big and little—in large
quantities, but is otherwise undistinguished.
Some gossip from London :
Here, in “ the height of the season,” London is full of
gaiety and movement. But, just fresh from Torquay, on
the Devonshire coast, I feel a touch of nostalgia as I think
of dear old Sydney. The vegetation around Torquay
irresistibly suggested Sydney.
“ The Merry Widow ” still'holds the centre of the stage
here, theatrically. But a very successful new cornedv is
“ Lady Frederick,” in which Ethel Irving plays lead.
Talking of theatricals, I saw at Ascot (in the royal en-
closure too !) two Australian girls, Miss Ruby* Lane-
Browne and Miss Ida Bernard, cutting considerable
dash.
Some Australians I saw at the Savoy the other day were
Mrs. Jim McEvo.v (she has grown very stout) and Mrs.
George Gaden, with her father. This place seems to be
infested with Australians. In Bond-street in one after-
noon I ran into Mr. and Mrs. F. Bacon and their daughter,
the last looking rather miserable, and Mr. and Mrs.
Walter Marks (who are living in Manchester-square).
All the Australians seem to hold their own.
Another line from a Sydneyside brunette now
in London:
A lot of Australians were at Ascot, looking very Arka-
dian. (I invented that word. It’s the synonym for
frumpish.) The most beautiful woman present was, I
thought, one of “The Merry Widow-” co., a girl named
Elizabeth Firth. She wore a white satin Directoire frock
with an umbrella-like black hat. On the river, Sunday
after Ascot, I saw Rose Musgrove, -looking very much up
to the minute. Marie Lloyd was in a launch with a
crowd—-all the women wearing early Victorian bonnets.
One sees these cute sweet bonnets on the Very Best
Class, and on the No Class at all. Many of the men
showed a good deal of sock, and in several instances'
the sock matched the hose worn by the girls of the party.
One Reggie had Rose du Barry hose. So had the Beatrice
Mauds in Reggie’s launch. Swell fashions here may be
summed up: clinging gow-ns, ruffles and umbrella hats.
As for the pretty little beauty-culturist hailing from
Australia —well, I saw a cheque (from a well-known
woman) for a hundred guineas. So the guinea-fowl must
have been satisfied with the result of the culturist’s treat-
men t.
Talking of clothes for the Society-whirl: A
Sydneysider writes from Paris of the rage
for hand-made frocks. Even the little French
work-girls wear beautifully-made frocks that they
construct themselves without the aid of a machine.
This “hand-made” craze does not touch cloth
frocks. “The favorite colors of Paris from now
to the winter will be cinnamon, prunella (which is
a very dull purple), and all blues, especially
canard or duck, and old blue. Beehive hats rage
here. ‘ Beehive ’ indeed ! They remind mein
size of the huge ants’nests I used to,‘see in the River-
ina. They (the hats—not the ants’ nests) are diffi-
cult to keep ‘ right there.’ Some are made with a
little pad or pincushion inside the centre of the
crown, and through this the hatpins are jabbed right
and left. The more hair of your own you have the
more likely the hat is to remain tethered. Jewel-
lers are working feverishly to supply thedemand for
fourteen-inch hat pins. The latest is the double
headed pin. The second or other end head un-
screws. Charlotte Cordays or beehives—they are
all high, top-heavy-looking things with lace
pleated under the brim.” Sydney milliners will
show such hats here presently. They are already
on the Commonwealth premises.
The new Tivoli dancer. Miss Kokin, pervades this
dripping-wet city lookingamostattractivebrownie.
She is quite young, and she frocks in brown
velvet and has a cascade of emu feathers in her big
brown hat. With her fair hair, faintly flushed little
face, and all her brown finish of Jfurs and tur-
quoises, she looks like the autumn girl they put
on the “art” almanacs. (You pick out the date
when your gas bill falls due, but the charm of the
brown beauty holding her brown muff against her
flushed cheek mitigates your frenzy at having to
pay the bill or have the smelly and combustible
vapor cut off.) On the stage Miss Kokin is an
eccentric dancer, and her first appearance is as a
ravishing “kiltie” speaking in the accents of
bonnie Scotland. Then she dances a Scotch reel,
and she is as light on her feet as a cork tossing
in the harbor. She is as American as the coming
Fleet; her husband (I forget his frantic name :it
sounds like the cry of a curlew —Curlew McHaggis,
or something like that) directs a troupe of missing
links, as a Tivoli turn. One of his baboons does
burlesquely human antics on finding the side door
of a hotel available after closing hours.
Talking of dancers : A returned Australian,
speaking of Maud Allan, the light fantastic toeist,
oyer whom London (including the old King and
his amazing young Queen) has gone off its head,
says that the excitement about her is due to her lack
of clothes whilst doing the airy toe play. “ Abso-
lute lack of clothes” was the Sydneysider’s phrase.
Challenged on this point by a listener who remarked,
“Whatever the old King might think of the
Dancing Nude, the Queen would scarcely encour-
age it by having Miss Allan dance before her,” the
Australian substituted “partial” for absolute.
The dancer’s feet are bare, and her longish robe
is a very gauzy garment indeed, made chiefly of
persiflage or epigram or some such light substance.
An almost fatal accident might have befallen
Mark Hambourg last week—if only a barber had
been quicker and asked no questions. The Master
Ivory-Puncher went into the barber’s parlor at
the Australia, and sate himself in a chair. “ Hair
cut, sir?” asked the operator, taking up the
shears. Mark clutched his head with both hands,
beads of cold Russian perspiration burst upon his
Beethovenish forehead, and into his Rubensteinish
eyes came the look of one who has had a provi-
dential escape from something worse than death.
“No, no, no !” he shouted ; “no hair cut ! Wash
my head ! ”
Miss Helen Mosely, a daughter of Captain'
Mosely, of Neutral Bay, and a pupil of Mrs. Fitz-
gerald, has joined “The Scarlet Troubadours,”
and made a fetching and successful first appear-
ance on Saturday night to a crowded house. She
is a bright, pretty little brunette of barely 18, with
an uncommonly good soprano voice, but is only
using the mezzo in active service just yet.
Last week was a week of postponements. Tram
strike and rain caused the putting off of the
Hospice Ball to the 13th of this month, and Lady
Northcote’s entertainment to Free Kindergarten
children was shunted into the indefinite future.
Mrs. Josephine Deakin (Mrs. J. E. Scantle-
bury), who has lately come back from foreign
parts and further study under some of the fore-
most voice- culturists, gave an invitation song-
recital at Paling’s, last week. Some 150 persons
were present, and so insistent in admiration that
they would have compelled the soprano to warble
150 gems if darkness, or tea, or time-tables or
something intrusive hadn’t saved her and her
charming voice from being sweated.
A quaint case has just concluded in London
before the Lord Chief .Justice. Mrs. Frankau,
who is “Frank Dauby,” the writer of “Pigs in
Clover ” and other novels scarifying the “Smart
Set” of Fogtown, sued the proprietors of Almack’s
Club for expelling her therefrom. Sir Hugh
Stewart, Bart., the secretary, and Mrs. Cald well,
the hon. secretary, were made defendants. Their
reasons for expelling Mrs. Frankau were vague,
diverse, and unsatisfactory. Mrs. Caldwell first
elected to rely on the charge that Mrs. Frankau
had “looked at her in a peculiar way as if she
(Mrs. Frankau) didn’t like her (Mrs. Caldwell).”
The Lord Chief Justice didn’t think much of that
as a reason for firing anyone out of a club, so Mrs.
Caldwell shifted her ground and explained that
“the Frankau woman had deliberately asked
people to dine with her in her own home and play
cards on the club Bridge nights”—thus lessening
the attendances in the card room of Almack’s.
Likewise Mrs. Frankau used to “throw off” at
her in the club. While playing cards Mrs.
Frankau would say in a nasty sarcastic voice, “Is
that an insult?” or “I shall have to report it to
the committee,” and immediately all those round
about would become convulsed with laughter.
Winding in and out of the case were weird allega-
tions that someone had slandered someone else’s
sister, that Mrs. Frankau wanted to bet too high,
that Lady Angela Forbes wouldn’t have Miss
Thomas sitting watching her play “because Miss
Thomas notoriously didn’t want her (Lady
Angela) to win,” and so on. In the end, the
proprietors of Almack’s were mulcted in £5O
damages for expelling Mrs.--Frankau, and were
ordered to reinstate her, and so the position of
at least one high-class London club remains “as
it was.”
“ Mario ” writes from Brisbane, away up the
river :
Already we see the first symptom of Carni val week. It
commences in a descending shower of hayseeds, on
August 10, and besides the show and races, there will be
the Kubelik concerts, the opening of the British pictures,
and an “ evening ” to view the same given by John
Forrest, at which evening Government House will come
along and shed an amiable lustre on the proceedings.
The pictures, hung under the personal supervision of
Allan Tunbridge, in the old Lands Office, look fine, and
the hair of the childish Lady Godiva, the fire of the
dragon’s mouth in Leighton’s “ Perseus and Andromeda,”
and the disagreeable face of the good angel in “The
Cloister or the World ” fill me with an unholy joy.
His Ex., burned brown as a coffee bean, came home
from the nor’-west on Tuesday. On Thursday evening he
got himself into the many glories that belong to him as
the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Free and
Accepted Masons, and putin an appearance at the Grand
Lodge ball. It was a joysome function, including a huge
scrimmage between various Masonic mat rons and the com-
mittee, a powder-and-patches gavotte, and no end of credit-
balance. Her Ladyship, in despair, I take it, of outshin-
ing her lord on this occasion (he being hung with gold and
precious stones, and looking like the Babylonian treasury),
robed her slender proportions in a clinging crfipe thecoior
of stewed prunes. Of the row—it was, of course, over who
should and who should not be in the set—there is a dark
tale which says that two irate dames (originally left out)
forced their usually placid husbands into holding a pistol
to the head of the lodge seeretarj-, who, in turn, pre-
sented a blunderbuss to the ear of the committee secre-
tary, and, behold, the thing was done.
Half our population will leave for your glittering city
immediately after Show week. Handsome Leslie Harris
goes on Friday. Misses O’Reilly, Forrest (along with Pa),
the passive Celia, and the Chief Justice, follow ;‘and so do
a heap of others. Meanwhile we have a lot of southerners
here. Admiral and Miss Bridges are at the Bellevue, also
Mrs. George Casey. A tall maiden named Thompson is
with shipping friends. The Wilsons still linger. We are
also enjoying the presence of Major Dangar, and the
Postal commission is bickering in our midst. Mrs. Talbot
has gone to Cairns, which is busy receiving the Com-
mander and the Brisbane fleet.
Two of our prettiest girls are off on a jaunt to India
—Kitty Morehead and Marian Darvall. They sail on Sep-
tember 29 for the land of black labor and enlarged liver.
There was laid to rest on Saturday one of the best
loved women in Brisbane, the wife of Dr. F. C. Marks,
M.L.C. Kindly, gentle, generous Mrs. Marks, with her
soft white hair, leaves a desolate house of three sons and
one little daughter still in her teens. Her fourth son,
Stodart, slipped over into the never-never land a few
years ago.
There was another ball this week, an infants’ matin6e
affair, which for rows licked one’s most exalted ideas
of the city of peace and rest (where 20,000 angels blow tin
trumpets without ceasing). First there was a fight over
the vice-regal bouquet, and another touching the
matter of whether the Mayoress should have a bouquet
also. The committee said “No” with one exception,
which resulted in the one exception going out and buying
a bouquet for the Mayoress on her own, and a much
more gorgeous one than the posy of the Governor’s lady.
This naturally vexed the economical-minded ones. Then
someone forgot to order a piano, and only for the good
nature of a lady who rushed to the rescue, the kids would
have been reduced to dancing to the strains of a concer-
tina. The infants looked fine. Among them I discovered
a Miss Essie Jenyns, a niece of the divine Essie, who used
to play Juliet and Parthenia of old. She has a real
Trilbyish “ wide smile,” and should be a good successor
to her illustrious aunt.
Kubelik’s advance man, Talbot by name, a shadowy
brown definition of a tram pole, has been winning him-
self laurels all along the line here. The great Jan
will be met on arrival by a slap-up motor-car and an
assorted choir, and there will be a mayoral reception to
follow.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.

“The Tike” (on “Westralia of all places”) :
“ Deeby,” for his statement “ that, generally speaking,
where the land of Westralia was not gravel it was white
sand, that failed to hold moisture ” (11. 11/6/’08), deserves
to be fried. He states that he was a newchuni, and
“tramped” with two othtr newohunis in search of a
section of the Westralian earth. That was foolish of
him. Like “Deeby,” I landed a newchuni in W.A., but
I didn’t “tramp.” I got a pass and the Guide from
the W.A. Lands Department took me around free in a
well-horsed buggy, for whose hire the State paid. To
get the sort of land I wanted I went 20 miles from a
railway. I there secured excellent chocolate soil without
difficulty. Out of my six neighbors, five are Victorians,
which either speaks well for W.A. or badly for Vic., with
its big holdings. I ask “ Deeby ” if he considers a State
where land brings up to or over £lOO an acre (see LI.
11/6/’OS), and where “ each block open for selection has
anything from 50 to 500 applicants” after it, is better for
a man with a “little capital” than a State such as W.A.,
that shows good average yields, and where a man can
mark out his own holding and get the land he likes at
10s. an acre. The best possible ad. for Westralia is that
each year sees dozens of new clearings being- made along-
side every road the State possesses, showing that those
who have tried “ Deeby’s ” “ white sand ” and “sand of a
slightly darker color ” are not complaining of it to their
friends or to the press overmuch.

To the query “Why is the American
Fleet?” may be made the reply that he is
mentally speedy because his climate stimulates to
high-geared mental action. But the Australian
needs to quicken his wheels of thought with well-
regulated oi lings of D.C.L., the Whisky of Wise
progress, if he rushes to hasten the advent of an
Australian Fleet in Being.*

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 3, 1908.
My Dear Yarrik,—
While the departed Talbottle rests his long and
weary limbs in a deck chair, the new State Figure-
head does his marionette dance. The Gioson-
" Carmichaels advance to the skirl of bagpipes. The
Carmichael is a braw Caledonian, with a rough
moustache and shaggy eyebrows, and a canny
droop of the eyelid that veils the shrewd
glint of Scotch-blue eyes. Not too spruce
in his dress (that wad be but vanity, ye
ken), but with a general slackness that drifts
out finally in the exaggerated length of his
Excellency’s pants. The vice-regal “continua-
tions ” or tubes or perpendicular tunnels encroach
quite a few unnecessary inches on the vice-regal
boots. His Lady is a buxom young dame, with a
fine complexion and a wide smiling mouth, very
full of very white teeth. She’s sonsie, which
means that, without being either pretty or smart,
she looks lovable. The two made their first
public appearance (after the swearing-in cere-
mony) at a reception stage-managed by the
acting-gaud-Mayor and his Mayoress. The
Town Hall wore its usual official dress of shiny
red-and-gold trimmings and scarlet carpet. At
half-past eight guests of the ordinary kind were
received within a narrow roped-in space, like the
gangway up which sheep rush when they go on
board ship, and all the Corporation and its respec-
tive gorgeously-gowned wife hurried through the
paw-shake to get the best points of vantage for
a glassy stare at the new Governoress and
her trappings, when she arrived fashionably at
nine o’clock. Mrs. Davey, the acting councillor-
in-chief, received suavely, looking like a German
post-card angel with blue eyes and blonde locks.
Her expansive charms rose out of the white hang-
ings of an Empire gown, even as somebody,
whose name I have mislaid, rose out of the sea.
The Carmichaels were led into action by a pro-
cession of pomposity, of mayoral furs and chains,
and much black, tight-cased corporation, and
lustre of silk-clad leg and glittering buckle; but
the acting-gaud-Mayor case off his fur entrench-
ments for the better display of a youthfully slim
figure. In special attendance on the vice-regals
were our old friend, Mr. Victor Hood (who will
be a real aide over the hurdles), and a brand new
gentleman-help, Captain Horace Hope, gorgeous
in scarlet and very close-fitting tartan whirly
things. Mrs. Carmichael draped herself in
adorable black Chantilly—a most appealing
piece of lace. She mounted it on green
—the dull green of a cypress—and added a
funereal note in a huge black aigrette (“regret”
Mrs. Wiggs would call it) in her hair. But,
of course, the lady’s diamonds blazed with bigger
blaze because of the background, and the enviable
lace looked the more costly for a buckle of
emeralds and turquoise, which clasped at where
the modish waist is supposed to be. Folks in
general were allowed to kow-towfrom afar, whilst
a pushing minority came to close quarters, and
chatted about their aunt in London or their grand-
father who was Scotch. Mrs. Kobert Harper
brought her richest “parritch” accent, and bobbed
in fringes of purple. Mrs. Justice a Beckett drew
attention to a marvellous pinky brocade with a
bright flame-colored scarf. Mrs. Edward Miller
did credit to her city. Mrs. Edward, of the
Miller clan, is indeed a superbly superior dame,
and her dresses take up all the picture
at the moment. Mrs. Kailway Tait shone
in the glamor of dull gold. Mrs. Iceberg
Irvine was quite blue—sky blue—and Miss
Byron Moore trailed yards of soft blue crepe-
de-chine. Mrs. Isaacs walked in a dazzle of
amethyst light; amethyst jewels and pale purple
asters on- a mauve gown. Mrs. Moss-of-much-
money, tad sister Mrs. Softgoods Butler, shone
in twin splendor of black and white—you couldn’t
tell t’other from which. The Turner lady fussed
in white, overshadowed by some huge Unknown
in blazing flame-color. A soft, sulphur-color
crepe dress talked most of the time to Mrs.
Harper’s purple, whilst little Mrs Bailleau aired
the new shade, “pale-ale.” Thus far nobody has
thought of introducing a new shade of browny-
black under the name of “bottled stout.” So
many women could suitably appear in “bottled
stout” —with a head on it.
Passengers on the sacred barge that brought
the new Governor folk speak of the two as most
homely folk. Mrs. Carmichael was much addicted
to “ wool-work,” and worked slippers and book-
marks with thfe modest and ancient cross-stitch
wherewith grahdmama did her “sampler.”
A shrieking, delighted house said good-bye to
“The Merry Widow” on Friday—just as big a
house as that which greeted the twenty-million-
airess six weeks ago. On Saturday night a still
bigger house, if possible, filled Her Majesty’s to
applaud “The Dairymaids.” Peggy-Carrie-
Moore threw some dashing high-lights on the cow-
maiden’s part. Baritone Higginson, society’s tin
god, entered for his first act in such ravishing
riding-gear that his adorers almost wept for joy.
The Lady Vice-Mayoress made an imposing prow-
head in black, glittering garb alongside her hus-
band’s slim figure and handsome silver head.
They boxed with Mrs. Manager Tallis, who was
fitted into a mermaid-y silver sheath half hidden
under Melba roses. In the opposite box was a
row of small coal-black heads—Carrie Moore’s
sisters—and sets of the Carrie-brand of shiny eyes
were fixed on every stage move.
The whole gaze of the House was concentrated
on the new Governor’s box during the entre acte
of “The Merry Widow.” It was his first visit to
the theatre—quite an official debut. The ex-
deputy-Excellency Maddens and the gaud
Mayors, and various other big guns, were in the
dress circle, but they gazed from afar ; it was
left to quite a small pistol to make
the one and only visit to the sacred box, and
brave the blaze of questioning eyes which said,
“Who on earth can she be ? ” But the lady of the
triumphal entry was merely the quiet little wife
of a local inkseller. The merchant, returning
from a business jaunt on the same deck as the
Governor-man, bad lent him a match and kept
the breeze off with his hat while the Excellency
lighted up, and thus a friendship had arisen and
blossomed like the green umbrella tree.
J. C. Williamson came over to courteously see
his Widow off the premises. With much scarlet
carpet and attendant gold lace the new
Carmichael Governor (Governors need branding
nowadays, there are so many of them floating
round) and his dame made their bow to the Aus-
tralian Widow and Her Majesty’s. The lady had
garbed herself in a powdery blue frock, which
showed out effectively when she slid out of
a gorgeously-padded cloak of scarlet and
blue. The Carmichael lady has beautiful
clothes wedded to an unfortunate lack of
the smart frocker’s instinct. As Mrs. Hawksbee
remarked of the other women in the “Plain Tales,”
she probably stands by and lets her husband throw
them at her with a pitchfork. The Lady’s soft,
dusky-black hair has a dowdy look—the look that
belongs to the women who make boast: “Once a
day is often enough to bother with any hair ; I
do mine in the morning, and it stays done.” But
Australia has spruced up Governors’ ladies
before now ; the youthful, trimly frocked and
coiffured Talbot lady, just departed, looks like
a younger up-to-date sister of the tired, bored,
droopy dame in a nondescript hat, who stood be-
side the Tall Excellency during his swearing-in
ceremony. The House assaulted itself with its
hands in welcome. The Governor bowed and had
to nudge Missus Carmichael to do likewise ; she
looked modestly and genuinely amazed that the
applause was for them. Captain Horace Hope, Mr.
Victor Hood, Major Watson in fussy frill, and a
half hidden ghost in khaki formed the bodyguard
and background. Two nieces, very young ladies,
have not been publicly shown so far. The nursery
(a domain known only at night to the Australian
female child after she has learned to walk)
probably clutches the Carmichael maidens of nine
and 1G years. Girls of the flapper stage are look-
ing forward to a time of high jinks—what with
two Carmichael nieces and a brace of Dudley
daughters.
The Governoress had. more frocky women to
gaze at from her box. The beauty of the Madden
maidens dazzled in white and blue and silver;
she came along with Vallange the Lean and his
roly-poly white-sheathed wife. They gazed from
afar at the Vice-Royalty, cogitating upon the
psychology of “ex” and the frail thread of
acting deputy-kings. Mrs. Fred Tasmanian
Forrest, gowned in lace and flame silk, flared
beside Dorothy Vane Menzies, who frocked in her
favorite faded-rose color and blazed behind a
diamond bird—a life-size swallow chooky that was
diamond to its wing-tips. Mr. Motor-Stephens
brought his new wife, all in white with a British
scarlet cloth coat, and her inseparable pal, Nell
Mackenzie, who japanned red iris on her pink
wrapping gear. The flame-color craze has
cropped up to shriek down the just-past purple
epidemic. One fair girl in the stalls swathed her
head in scarlet ribbon like a turban ; probably a
beacon to Higginson the Adored, as her gaze
followed the about-to-depart mummer like that of a
hypnotised kerosene drinker. Stalls and dress
circle were booked back to pit and gallery, so
most of Melbourne society dazzled.
Governor Gibson-Carmichael, not being a
military expert like Sydenbam Clarke nor an
authenticated descendant of Norman barons like
the Talbot, must do the best he can with his'
small reputation for entomology. Already he has
paid several visits to the Museum, where he
astonishes the staff with his knowledge of Victorian
spiders. Wily women are already deferentially
consulting his Excellency re the venomousness or
otherwise of daddy longlegs, while elocution
teachers are coaching their pupils in that sweet,
little Nature-study, “ The Spider and the Fly.”
The boom in Australian art, which originated
with Arthur Streeton’s exhibition, still continues
mildly in Melbourne. At the Victorian Artists’
Show already £l5O worth of paint and canvas has
found favor with the local Medici, among whom
the most distinguished patrons are Prof. Baldwin
Spencer and Mr. L. Abrahams. Other exhibi-
tions are threatened in the near future ; and there
is some possibility of knights errant of the
brush, like Longstaff and Tom Roberts, return-
ing homewards for a spell. In Melbourne the
artist is becoming such a recognised institution
that in time, as in Paris, even the dogs won’t baric
at him, and the rabbit-oh will cease to urge him
to get his hair amputated.
Ethel Carrick (Mrs. Fox) opened a glad little
picture show in Bernard’s Gallery on Monday.
The collection is full of color, and there is much
merit in it. “Le Marche,” shown in the
Salon (1907), is a fine effect of sunlight flecking
through trees on a moving crowd beneath. The
sense of movement is a reality. The lady gets
the effect by instinct, for her drawing is often
inaccurate. “ Washing Place at Chartres” has
excellent color and impressionistic effect, yet the
windows) though natural enough in impression,
are as wildly unsteady as a homeward drunk.
There are some beautiful color-touches of scenes
in Venice and Paris. Some pretty little sketches
about Sydney show a Streeton-like appreciation of
the blues of the Harbor. By the way, why is it
that nearly every artist here paints boats on the
water —never in the water ? A corner of Paddy’s
Market, near Sydney station, is an excellent
effect of color and movement. Apart from her
bigger, more serious works, there is a jolly little
collection of the popular pot-boiler that should
find ready buyers.
Poor old Helen Hart, who died lately at South
Yarra, felt extra bitter these last few years. The
gaunt woman, who might have been chopped out
of a piece of hardwood, battled long for “women’s
rights” and such things; and when some of “such
things” arrived, and were as usual petted by the
fashionable dames who in old times had scorned
them, Helen felt herself crowded out. And the
more she demanded recognition for what she had
done, the more amused the fashionable dames
were, and the more bitter grew Helen. Hers was a
gloomy life. She didn’t frivol herself, and she hated
frivol in others—hated it to the extent, on one
memorable occasion, of taking a horsewhip into a
newspaper office which had guffawed over-loudly
at her quaintness. Her lectures once afforded
her a kind of a living, but latterly she collected a
little scarce cash for herself, from politicians and
such, on the strength of her old-time services to
‘‘the cause.” Her alleged poems, at Is. a
time, also helped a little; but still the struggle
to keep the landlady at bay was a
bitter one. Yet Helen was a fighter to the last;
when the wolf became too obstreperous at the
door, she boiled the animal and ate iti In fact, it
was what she mostly lived on in her later days.
As a trance medium she was at a discount ever
since a mine was baled out at great expense, by
her direction, to find the dead body of Policeman
Ryan, who was not found, and is still missing; but
as she never made much as a medium the loss
wasn’t serious. Miss Hart left behind her her
sixpenny hat, her blue veil, her famous grey
ulster, her worn black bag, and a photograph of a
huge umbrella with a placard on it, “Vote for
Bent.” And she left very little besides.
Kubelik had the Marshall-Hall orchestra behind
him last Thursday, but the worshipped M.-H.
and his minions shrivelled into a pigmy back-
ground when the little elf-man got going
on concertos. On the ground floor of a
good, frocky house (which, however, had
no Governors or Exes or Mayoral people
to lend official frill to the proceedings)
I saw Dr. Stawell with his newly-engaged Sister
Connolly. It’s a most romantic romance and it
arose from indigestion. Sister Connolly, who is
matron of the Foundlings’ Home, fell ill of that
morbid complaint, and the doctor rescued her;
whereupon he desired her to entrust her restored
animation to his keeping. The lady has been
pelted with gifts since the announcement of
her departure from the Home. Mrs. Madden
presented her with muph silver- and brush-ware,
and the hairpin box has not been wanting, neither
has the scent-bottle failed in the land.
The Pianola Co.’s removal has developed into
an event. All the week privileged personages
have been admitted to the new sanctuary, on The
Block, to see the wonderful decorations and hear
how much they cost. The six or seven storey
building, which used to be sacred to unimportant
law offices, and to the premises of Mr. Dragger,
the dentist, and his rival, Dr. Hawler, is now a
burst of peacock plush glories, and painted frescos,
and embroidered silks, punctuated by scores of
mechanical devices for playing Chopin and other
marriage-inducing music. Some of the seven
storeys are to be occupied by teachers ; others are
to be “demonstrating boudoirs,” where the
HMian will persuade the timid would-be pur-
chaser to hesitate no longer.
The matinee in aid of the Distressed Actors was
rather a frost this year. There were more pro-
gramme-sellers and sweet vendors than audience, I
estimate. The show wasn’t wonderful. Walter
Baker recited some Tennyson superbly, and his
voice was a cadenced joy. Seclusion suits the bulky
ex-hero’s art. One of Mrs. Green’s pupils danced
sweetly, and some “ Fatal Wedding” and “Merry
Widow” made up the sum of solid attractions.
Conductor Howard Carr (.atoned one of his own
compositions—a “Pastoral Overture,” which was
dainty and quaint like the reliefs upon a Grecian
base, and marred only by a conventionality or so.
The profession was in evidence. Mistress Dorothy
Vane Menzies, in a grandmotherly brown-velvet
garment and a hat like a marquee, had a little
party, and several Mrs. Taits spread their frills in
the circle. Mrs. Stuart Murray, in sombre rai-
ment, sat at the end of a solid row of free and
enlightened constituents. Daisy Belmore (Mrs.
Waxman), in a swishing swathe of black silk, sold
programmes on the strength of her smile, which
is the color of the Peruvian banner. Miss Bruton
shook a curly head under a ducky blue hat,
banded with silver. And the Cabbage-patchers
came in force, and got stared at. The Loyey
Mary lass is the most pinchable lassie of them all.
And the youths look ’cute, and certainly sound it.
Otherwise there was a record small attendance.
The Harvey Patterson-Peel Sharp amalgama-
tion of interests in life came as a surprise. We
guessed it would happen, and didn’t know when,
and expected a flourish of trumpets in any case.
However, Miss Athelstane who was, came quietly
back from Sydney a fully-fledged matron for the
second time, and took possession of the Patterson’s
gorgeous flat in William-street. All the fencing-
pupils of yester-year are jubilant. They see the
lady with a long memory and postbags full of
invitations for them to more or less magnificent
festivities. But, so far, the bride has not bur-
geoned forth as a hostess. Instead, she demurely
goes a-shopping with a suave step-daughter, and
says nuffin.
Melbourne University Literature Society holds
its fourth monthly meeting on August 10, when
Professor Henry Jones, from Glasgow, will lecture
on “Metaphors that Mislead.” The subject
sounds a suitable continuation of the discourse on
Bernard Shaw, which the Rev. F. Sinclair, M.A.,
gave to the M.U.L.S. members last month.
Bernard Pshaw has been described as the greatest
of modern artists in metaphor that misleads.
This is the week when doggy people are at their
happiest, and chicken fanciers cluck joyfully to-
gether. The Victorian Poultry and Kennel Club
holds its annual show at the Exhibition Building,
commencing on the sth and concluding with a
grand chorus of rowdy exhibits on the Bth.
A play by a Melbourne girl—who is, pre-
sumably, Australia’s pioneeress in serious stage
work—has gone into rehearsal, and will transpire
at Her Majesty’s, on Saturday, September 26, in
aid of the City Newsboys’ Society, Premier
Adolphus Bent having promised £5OO, with the
proviso that another £5OO must ensue. To that
end Mrs. Donald McKinnon has arranged for a
meeting at the Town Hall on August 21, and the
Deputy gaud-Mayor takes the chair. The play,
which is from the sprightly J nib of Miss Sumner
Locke, is a comedy-drama in four acts, entitled
“The Vicissitudes of Vivienne.” Harry Hill,
who has the stage management in hand,
thinks highly of the damsel’s ambitious effort,
as regards both the dialogue and the con-
struction. Two of the scenes introduce a lot
of “ walking ” characters in smart frocks. These
will provide opportunity for a strong infusion of
Toorak’s Very Best People and the patronage
appertaining thereto. All things considered,
“The Vicissitudes of Vivienne” promises to
amount to an Event.
A man up in one of our wool stores is a person
whom any wise girl should be glad to call mother.
A while ago, as he was being transferred to a
better berth, his subordinates resolved to give him
a souvenir of the occasion. When they’d concen-
trated sufficient half-crowns to buy him a ripping
gun, or golf-kit, he was asked to confess his pre-
ference. Said the high panjandrum : “I’d like a
silver kettle for mv glory-box. I might get mar-
ried some day, so I aq> collecting nice little things
for the house. . , . Oh, no; I haven t decided
which lady I will ask yet ! ” Now that man will
probably die a spinster. He’s of .the kind that
often does. Men like him will be refused by girls
who live even in the dreadful house that is Queen
Anne in front and Sarah Jane behind—refused
in favor of the boy who leaves the meat.
Women do so dislike a man who has
the tender forethought to buy a bargain line
of drawn-thread d’oyleys at a clearing sale, or
who takes an afternoon tea-set instead of a
tantalus when he’s offered something. Which is
foolish of women—and yet I can sympathise.
“Rosna ” sends some news from Adelaidet—
Our Excellencies hurried up into the untidy and neg-
lected interior to meet the Governor-General, as he came
loafing down the Murray. They brought him to Adelaide
in triumph, and also in the Psyche. On arrival, he was
subjected to a set of levies, luncheons, dinners and
health-drinkings by all the local celebrities who could
find the necessary tailcoat for the occasion. Also, quite
a large crowd accompanied him to the train to weep the
wet globule of farewell on the vice-regal shirt-front. The
departure of our own State Excellencies is fixed for the
tail-end of this year or the beginning of next. They will
be regretted, for they are pleasant folk, who have made
many friends and have buried no enemies secretly in the
backyard.
Our returned Premier and Premieress got through
another batch of welcomes last week, and they are still
being dragged hither and thither to have speeches shot
at them by a populace that seems determined to give
them no rest. A fine motor is one of the items they have
brought back from the City of Brown Fogs, and it hae
earned its bread-and-butter since it landed on these
shores. The mayoral Cruickshanks, of St. Peters, got the
local Tow'n Hall into its best floral garniture of wel-
come on the 24th, and scoured the country for mewsical
talent, and invited a large concourse. There Premier
Price was much and deservedly shaken by the hand,
and Mrs. Premier, in a beauteous blue frock, had a
bouquet of violets pushed at her, and accepted it with a
heavenly smile. There was a festive supper afterwards,
with a string band attached. Unley also burst into a
welcome ceremony, and the Norwood Prossers begged the
travellers to come and be guests of honor at their ball.
Norwood is such a thriving city that it has to split its
mayoral ball up into two nights, and as w r e can’t con-
veniently split up the only Premier we have, he went along
and got his welcome at the first fragment of the pleasant
function. Mrs. Price wore her beauteous presentation
gown of chiffon marvellously embroidered in gold. The
Court train (which doesn’t appear in public, of course) is
deep cream satin, lined with palest blue glacd, and be-
sprinkled with glorious purple orchids. At the shoulder
it is caught with cream tasselled cords. Mrs. Price is a
graceful and stately dame, and adorns the lovely gar-
ment.
This city has discovered a promising voice, and flatters
itself that it may rival in quality and volume that of the
great, not to say tremendous, Clara Butt. The owner is
a girlie named Clara Kleinschmidt. She has been un-
earthed from some place in the hills, and sent to study
the warbling art under Miss Hack at the Conservatoire.
She made her ddbut at the Orchestral Concert last week,
and created something of a furore, though her training
is scarce as yet. She has temperament, a fine range, and
splendid physique, and is moreover still quite a youthful
and pig-tailed maiden with all the world before her.
The Hunt Club had a spell of fine weather for its Point-
to-Point steeplechase t’other Saturday, and for once the
hurried, worried, sudden, red-coated throng did not
plunge through vast rivers of mud with an icy blast blow-
ing down its neck. And that was so rare an event that the
club fell down dead several times with surprise. The event
was held at Seaton, a salubrious spot near the brine.
Seaton boasts of golf links and other dignities. A large
quantity of that which would like to be called quality got
its enthusiasm out of its glass-case and sped forth to the
fray, which was quite as thrilling to the participants and
almost as chilling to the lookers-on as usual.
The Hunt Club Ball had red horse-shoes on a leafy
background for its decorative scheme, and pale-blue vege-
tation climbed like the Alpine Club up the staircase.
There was the usual hunting set, with powdered-haired,
Gainsborough-hatted dames dancing in it, and tne
supper-room wore hunting pictures round its walls.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

HAPPY, HEALTHY CHILDREN
fill the home with sunshine. When they become fretful
and out of sorts, it is generally because a mild laxative
is required —not a purgative, mind ! Nothing is so truly
beneficial in such cases as a dose of California Syrup of
Figs, which the little ones accept eagerly for its delicious
flavour: and it causes no discomfort: just relieves and
corrects gently, naturally, comfortingly, overcoming the
tendency to constipation. For its perfect purity and
harmlessness, as well as for its truly beneficial effects,
it is cordially endorsed by the medical profession.

Portions of the Ma State’s western district have
been suffering from a band of confidence men. Their
methods show a spice of originality. They drive up in
the guise of pedlars, and their stock-in-trade consists of a
sample tarpaulin and horse rug—the former being worth
about £4 and the latter about £1 Is. Orders are booked
for these at £1 and 7s. respe'ctively, and the country
dweller furtively shakes hands w'ith himself and congra-
tulates himself under breath on having made a unique
bargain. Then, in a casual sort of way, the pedlars pro-
duce a bundle with pieces of cloth in it. They explain to
the bucolics that their cutter and fitter will be along
in a day or so, and that for a paltry £5 ss. they
will dispose of the cloth, instruct their cutter to
call on and measure the buyer, and have a suit fixed
up at a first-class city tailory. The outside value of the
cloth is about £l. Of course the ordered stuff (which is
the bait used to snare the unw'ary rustic) never turns up,
neither does the cutter and fitter ; all the Wayhacker
scores is a few lengths of shoddy and a fathom or two of
experience. As in all other confidence cases, he falls in
through his willingness to—as he thinks—get the better
of the other fellow.
* * * *
The time-payment piano industry has had a
good deal of light thrown upon it in recent years, chiefly
per medium of the small debts court; but still few people
realise that its present-day expansion is due to the
immensity of human gullibility. The writer know's a firm
dealing in new and second-hand furniture. That firm
does an extensive and highly lucrative business on time-
payment ; and it is really astonishing the amount of
candle box and picture wire that can be foisted upon a
credulous public in the guise of a piano. Certainly the
firm’s customers are not in a position to detect little
defects in an instrument, nor do thej' possess ears
trained to perceive obscure falsities of tone. They are
usually the hardworking- and poorer residents of the
suburbs—people to whom a piano, on seemingly easy
terms, is a boon, and, moreover, evidence of their
increased social standing. Lured by the gaudy, attract-
ive ads. of the firm, which offers an alleged £6O instru-
ment for os. a week, or thereabouts, they go in, inspect a
magnificent upright grand, and finally agree to buy it on
t.p. A day or two later the piano is delivered ; but it
isn’t always the same piano. Many times it is a decayed
secondhand instrument, with nothing new about it except
the varnish. Still it has sufficient resemblance to the one
chosen to easily deceive the buyer, who seldom troubles
to take minute mental notes of its appearance. However,
one prospective buyer, who was forewarned, did
take particular notice of the instrument he pro-
posed to buy, and went so far as to mark it
secretly. When he received the wrong one that he had
not ordered, he went round, showed the marked piano, and
threatened prosecution for fraud if it was not delivered
instanter. It was delivered. Of course, the firm has to
get rid of its cast-off instruments somehow. When a
client is unable, through adverse circumstances, to pay
the weekly or monthly instalment, the piano is seized
and sold to somebody else. That is the virtue of the
whole business —selling the same piano to as many people
as possible, until its antiquity becomes too blatant for
successful trade. But buyers are warier than they used
to be, so the firm is now feeling for the country trade
with little ads. like these :
Piano, superior upright grand, iron frame, check
action, full compass, brilliant tone ; cost £6O ;
going away, sell £2O or best offer. 2417 Blank-
street, Blankville.
Piano, beautiful upright grand, by Boggabri, practi-
cally new. Stool and quantity of sheet music ;
selllot £25 ; one of finest instruments in State.
Mr. Tompkins, 2415 Blank-street, Blankville.
Pianoforte, latest improvements, two months in use ;
experts say it’s a most superior instrument;
touch and quality of tone magnificent; cost £7O,
sell £3O. Mr. Harris, 2413 Blank-street, Blank-
ville.
Those ads. all refer to the same piano, or any old piano
which happens to be in stock ; but no casual reader would
suspect that. As to the address, the firm’s large plate-
glass emporium at 2413-5-7-9-11-13 Blank-street, allows it
some latitude in that respect.
“Eric” : The “cut line” is a thing of horror
always; when it is an imported “cut line,” it is not
horrible merely but lethal. A distilling firm in the Cold
Country is offering to sell to Australian warehousemen a
concoction, which it has the colossal bluff to style
whisky, at 2s. per gallon f.o.b. at Glasgow', casks in-
cluded ! Picture, if you can, the effects of a jamboree on
this liquid Sheol, and, when you have recovered presence
of mind enough, try to figure out how Australian dis-
tillers, w'ho are compelled to make honest whisky, and to
mature it in wood for two years, can buck up against
such competition. The Scotch wash referred to is quoted
at 8 overproof, and it is blatantly asserted by the con-
coctors that it is guaranteed to have reposed for two
years in wood. It thus becomes obvious: (a) That the
Glasgow exporters have stumbled on the art of convert-
ing the Firth of Clyde into whisky ; or (b) they are attempt
ing a terrific undercut at the Australian distiller; (c)
that the Australian who planks down his tanner for a
nobbier of the stuff is an entrant for the Silent Tomb
Stakes, and is likewise indictable under the Noxious
Gargle Act. , * *
English papers which have inquired into the
question say that the betting on football in the Midlands
or North is enormous, It mostly takes the roundabout
form of “ skill competitions,” in which you buy 12 coupons
for 6d., and have 12 shots at guessing the result of each
Saturday’s League matches. There are 20 to choose
from ; £7O is given for getting 10 results right (and none
wrong), £llO for 11, and a maximum of £320 for 12. It
must be remembered that in the small-scoring Soccer
code a draw is almost as likely as any other result, yet
a draw is very difficult to forecast in any given instance.
Allowing win, lose, or draw' to be equally likely, it appears
to the writer that the chance against getting 12 results
right is something over the sporting odds of half a
million to one. On the other hand, some half-dozen
matches each week are practical certainties in advance,
so that the big prizes may sometimes be claimed. In that
case the turnover in coupons must be enormous to make
the thing pay at all. There is a standing offer of £lOO
for forecasting four correct goal-scores, which is a much
harder matter.

With loud ptomaine remarks upon your parting Tory

T° DA TE fen thousand six hundred and twenty -Jive Beale Pianos have
been sold in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, Norfolk Island\
India , China, Ceylon, Mauritius , South Africa, and, judging by the
warm letters of approval daily received by us, they are giving universal
satisfaction . reason for this is that every detail in the manufacture of
our pianos is carried out with the most painstaking care , instruments
embody many unique features which increase the excellence of the musical
qualities as well as the durability of the instrument. Our factories at
A nnandale include thirty different departments in which we carry on more of
the actual processes of piano manufacture than any other piano-makers in the
world. By making all details in our own factories we obtain full control of the
quality throughout; by seasoning the timber in a tropical climate it is better fitted
to withstand the ravages of a hot and variable atmosphere; by building the
cabinet-work on our patented system of cross-plied stock the danger of warping
and cracking is obviated; by our secret process for fortifying the sounding-board
that part of the instrument is rendered secure against climatic influence ; by the
use of a metal instead of a wooden wrest-plank what has hitherto been the
weakest part of all pianos is now (in the Beale Pianos) the strongest and most
durable part.
As to the tonal qualities of the Beale A ustralian Pianos, perhaps the most
striking evidence is that of people who have bought from us and who have
written us to say that other Beale Pianos have been sold merely through
passers by m the street and visitors at their homes having heard their pianos
played. We can show the originals of such letters to anyone desirous of seeing
them. Below we reproduce one in full as a sample:
The Beale Patent Piano supplied to me is undoubtedly one of the best that I have listened
to. Not only is its tone rich and full, but for general quality and appearance it could not be
surpassed. Your Wallsend agent has sold a couple of the same instruments since I got mine
merely through its being heard from the street. I will have much pleasure in always recom-
mending them to anyone I know who is likely to require one.

COSTIVENESS.
The Cause of Much Suffeeing.
To maintain a healthy system the bowels should
operate at least once every 24 hours. This is one
of Nature’s provisions which is too often ignored,
and the result is untold suffering. Women are
the greatest offenders, but sooner or later they
must pay the penalty. Many women’s ailments
are due to the straining and purging, following
upon habitual constipation, and in many cases
displacement of the pelvic organs may be attributed
to the same cause.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Although a tram strike and a week of continuous
downpour had for a time obliterated all mention of the
Arnst-Pearce sculling match, something like 15,000 people
were ashore and afloat to watch the .struggle and find out
what the winner of the Sydney Thousand could do with
his arms. His legs they’ knew all about; his arms were
an unknown quantity. And the interest in them was
sufficient to cause £137 12s. worth of tickets to be pur-
chased by enthusiasts, who stood out in the rain the long
journey up the river rather than lose the chance of getting
good positions for following the race. The rain had
beaten the water flat, and had the steamers arrived at
Ryde to time the race would have been rowed under ideal
conditions. But they were 20 minutes late, and it was
nearly half-past four when the scullers got way, and felt
in their teeth the first gusts of a head wind that steadily
increased in force. The popular expectation that Pearce
would shoot away and lead Arnst a heart-breaking race
for two miles was not fulfilled. It was Arnst who shotaway.
Pearce responded gamely, and at the end of a quarter-
of-a-mile had drawn level. They streaked along together
at a terrific pace in spite of the rising wind, till, at the
half-mile, Pearce momentarily went to the front, leading
by a length. The big Maorilander just bent down and
lifted. His boat shot alongside,. and forged slightly
ahead. At three-quarters of a mile Arnst began to put
more strength into it, and it became apparent that he
had so far been keeping a lot in reserve. At Kissing
Point he went to the front, and thence to the finish it
was a case of Arnst rowing away, and Pearce making
frantic spurts, drawing up, almost closing on his rival,
and being left again with monotonous regularity. It was
at Abbotsford, with the winning post just round the
corner, that Pearce pulled himself together for his last
great effort. It was a very fine effort, but he had no hope
against the 100-h.p. sculler in the other boat. Arnst left
him when he pleased, and finally paddled home an easy
winner by 2J lengths in 20min. 50see.
It was a splendid race. There was never a
suspicion of a foul, of boring, or of anything that could
detract from the symmetry of it all. The unknown man
stood suddenly revealed as a mighty sculler, one on whom
the championship of the world will almost certainly
fall. Beauty of style, grace of poise, he had none. He
was a great, grim, black rowing-machine, made for
utility only. He didn’t even sit straight, but bent over
all on one side, like a crab with rheumatism in his hind-
quarters. But he drove his boat as fast as it was neces-
sary, and could have driven it faster had he desired,
and after that long struggle over three miles and
330yds. he was as fresh as any morning daisy,
while his opponent was all but dead to the world.
Pearce was a beaten man at Kissing Point, but he
struggled gamely to the finish and gave his backers as
good a race as they will ever get for their money.
Although the time was not particularly fast, compared
with some that have been made over the same course, it
was good in the face of the wind ; and when Webb meets
Arnst on the Wanganui he will have to row a much
harder race than the day he pricked the bubble champion-
ship of Charles Towns. It will be an interesting and
exciting race, and worth going to Wanganui to see.
How Arnst’s backers appreciated Pearce’s
effort in a hdpeless cause is shown by the fact that
some of them have offered to back him for a race
with big Ben Thoroughgood. At time of going to press
it was not known if Thoroughgood was willing, but the
chances are he will be only too delighted.

On Saturday last the British motor boat Wolse-
ley-Siddeley met—or should have met—the Yankee cham-
pions in a race for the British International Cup, oyer the
Huntington course. But, strange to say, at time of
writing, no cable had announced how the race went, nor
even mentioned whether there was any race at all.
Curious how the cablegrammer sticks to English news.

J. B. Holdsworth found that his private busi-
ness would prevent him taking a second term as secretary
of the N.S.VV. Motor Boat Club. That body was fortu-
nate in securing as his successor the trusty yachtsman
and all-round aquatic sportsman, C. M. Barker, long and
honorably known as the owner and commander of the
yacht Bui Bui. The trouble with the N.S.W. M.B.C. is
plain apathy on the part of the members, and C. M.
Barker is about the best antidote for apathy the club
could have got hold of. He has just built himself a new
boat, with which he reckons he will be able to work up
some enthusiasm.
The Anglo-Welsh footballers arrived in Sydney
from Maoriland on Friday last, looking as though they
had returned from the storming of a fortress. In the
evening Captain Harding, with his liver in a sling as the
result of a kick from an All-Black (one might as well be
kicked by a devil), led his men down to the Town Hall,
where refreshments and eloquence were turned With
the wrecks of his butchered team around him the English
captain spoke admiringly of the Maoriland Rugbians, and
confined his objections to a mild attack on the wing
forward system. As a beautiful and glorious example of
heaping coals of fire on the heads of those who injure
you, Harding’s address was one to make bishops weep
with envy. v *
Sydney Metropolitan Rugby Union’s Eirst
Grade Competition ended with a sudden rush. On
Saturday, on a slushy field, Newtown tramped clean
through South Sydney by 14 to nil. Hardly had the
teams left the mixture of muck and tan than Glebe and
University filed on, and excitement ran high: Most people
guessed that Newtown would crumple up the Sandpipers,
blit the meeting of the red rocks and the blue-and-gold
storin was a much more doubtful event. And at half-
time it was equally doubtful, the score being five all; but
in the second spell the University forwards got all over
the Glebe men, and the game ended in a win for them by
16 points to eight. It was a totally unexpected margin.
All Saturday night the rain fell in torrents. On Sunday
morning it made an effort to clear up, but by the
afternoon the rain was lurking round again, and by
evening it waspouringas heavily as ever. All night and
Monday morning it continued to fall, and when the two
remaining teams, Newtown and University, arrived at
Sydney Cricket Ground to play the final, most of the field
was under water, and what wasn’t slush was bog. After
a screamingly funny game of mud polo Newtown crawled
out in an unrecognisable state champion team for 1908,
having crushed University by 17 points to nil. This is the
first time Newtown has carried off the premiership.
Twice running (1906 and ’O7) Glebe held the position, and
in 1901 Glebe and University shared it, as George Reid
and Allan McLean did the Premiership. In 1904 Uni-
versity managed to get the dignity all to itself, only to
lose it to South Sydney in 1905.
* * * *
Now that the competition is over, the Rugby
Union will fill in the rest of the season with matches
against the Anglo-Welsh team. These will last till the
beginning of September, when the spring will be in the
land and the footballer will retire within his shell and
cease from troubling
* * *
While J. J. Giltinan was dreaming great
dreams of amalgamating the Northern Union and Aus-
tralian games, he wandered into a mudhole in the shape
of a revolt of the Maori team that was playing under the
League’s management. A gentleman named Jack had
got an injunction restraining the League from paying
over to the Maoris any of their share of the proceeds of
the tour till the Supreme Court decided how much Mr.
Jack was entitled to. A Maori hates law —when it stops
his supply of cash —and the dark players began to
chafe. They were apparently under the impres-
sion that the League was withholding more money
than the injunction called for, and on Saturday
morning they notified the League that they would
play no more matches under its auspices. They
were cleaned out financially, notwithstanding that
they had received since they landed £lO4O ss. 5d., and
some of them had to cable to Maoriland for the where-
withal to continue the enjoyment of life in the Babylonish
city. The result of the upheaval was that the League
had no matches in Sydney on either Saturday or Monday.
Naturally, the League feels very sore about it. Probably
Mr. Jack is feeling ruffled too, as the total amount to the
credit of the Maoris is said by the League officials to be
only £129 9s. 2d. It’s a weird jumble, and the League is
now probably feeling sorry it didn’t stick to Pakeha football,
for—regardless of the rights or wrongs of the business —
it will do the League harm just at a time when it wants
all the limelight and kudos it can get.
* * * *
Of Vic. League games the always-uproarious
collision of South and Carlton, aided by glorious weather,
drew the largest crowd —some 25,000 —most of whom de-
parted in a state of disgust. The first quarter was good
football, but thereafter South’s fierce efforts to make up
its leeway and the incompetence of the umpire turned
the encounter into an ill-considered bogging-in of angry
heaps of meat. The red-and-white heavy-weights made
the mistake of trying to run with the ball, and when,
towards the end, they found themselves getting
further and further in the rear, they threw' their
little science to the winds and resorted to main
force. Carlton followed suit, and the closing epi-
sodes were little more than an unmannerly scramble.
South could soothe itself with the reflection that of the
luck of the game Carlton got 90 per cent. ; even the wind
changed in the last quarter to suit the Northerners.
Scores, 67 to 41. The concussion of the democratic
neighbors, Richmond and ’Wood, also drew a packed
house. Richmond had just been beaten by the lament-
able Geelong team, wherefore ’Wood, fresh from its vic-
tory over the mighty Essendon, anticipated a soft thing
—and fell in. The Yellow-and-Blacks were on their own
ground, with their best team playing, and they leaped at
things to such purpose that at half-time they had put up
32 points to the Magpies’ 13. Then the latter settled
to business and piled on goal after goal. But three
of their best men were away, and they found as the after-
noon waned they had lit their opponents get too long a
lead, and when the bell rang they were still five points in
default—69 to Richmond’s 74. The meeting of ’Varsity
and Melbourne, though neither club boasts many regular
followers, promised such a strenuous exhibition of good
football that the rush was quite considerable. In effect,
the teams gave the best match of the day. Good
umpiring kept the play open and fast, and,
though the students led by 22 points to one at the first
change, their opponents steadily pulled up thereafter
till, at three-quarter time, they had got 45 points on the
board to ’Varsity’s 41. The last quarter was crowded
with excitement as first one, then the other, scored a
sixer or a single, but the students kicked the straighter,
and a clever goal just on time gave them the victory—sB
points to 54. Fitzroy met Essendon, but the latter is a
certainty for the finals, and ’Roy’s name is Mud now ;
wherefore the collision interested nobody but the respec-
tive partisans. Essendon notched 8 goals 13 behinds to
’Roy’s 7 goals 8 behinds. Saints w'ere at home to Geelong,
and emphasised their superiority by potting 17 goals
5 behinds to the sleepy citizens’ 5 goals 8 behinds.
A w'eariful and saddening episode at the tail end
of each season is the bogging-in of teams that
have fooled aw'av their early chances and must
necessarily play three or four matches to no earthly
purpose. The result of Saturday’s games is that Carlton
and Essendon maintain their superiority and St. Kilda
looks more probable than before for the finals. For the
fourth place, ’Wood, South and Melbourne are still equal;
but University has now come up to their level, and if the
students can but down Carlton in the last game before
the finals —they should easily beat ’Rov and Geelong in
the interim—then, all South’s struggles and ’Wood’s
system and Melbourne’s upheaval will avail them no-
thing ; the Students will arrive. But this paper wouldn’t
advise anyone to bet more than sixpence on the chance.

The Association position is just as exciting. Of
four clubs that are fighting for the second, third, and
fourth places, ’Town has 11 wins to its credit and a
probable win and a defeat in front of it ; Essendon has
10J wins with two more in prospect ; Brunswick has 10
wins, and two hard battles before it; and P’ran has 9£
wins, with a similar prospect to Brunswick’s. Both these
latter prospects include games against Brighton, which
is only a step lower than P’ran , so, though the seaside
club has no “semi-final” hope itself, it can make things
decidedly awkward for otherparties. On Saturday’Scray,
’Town and Brunswick all had comparatively soft things
in Northcote, North and Preston respectively, the chief
object of each being to pile up goals and behinds,
so that if their wins were equal that day fortnight
they might crawl into the finals on points scored. The
boards showed’Scray 68, ’Cote 40 ; ’Town 121, North 40 ;
Brunswick 82, Preston 44. The collision of the day
occurred at Essendon, whither P’ran journeyed with two
train loads of barrackers in a state of great excitement.
The teams had each nine wins and five losses to brag of,
and their previous engagement had ended in a draw ;
and Brunswick was but half-a-game behind and was
certain to beat Preston. Consequently the anxiety of
the players extended even to the barrackers, and a
singularly silent but st renuous game ensued. Essendon’s
superiority was manifest, especially in the second half of
the encounter, but the aforementioned anxiety caused
both sides to play so erratically and kick so wildly that
disaster might have occurred to either at any moment.
Two straight shots between the sticks would have turned
the day at any stage. The scores were 21 all at three-
quarter time, but though the ball was booted over the
line eight times in the last quarter, only one of those eight
shots was a goal—Essendon’s. Scores: ’Don, 3 goals 13
behinds ; P’ran, 2 goals 12 behinds. P’ran is nowpraying
to its gods that Brighton will be kind enough to beat
Brunswick ; but the lesson that applies to the League
clubs—and to Australia in general—applies equally here,
viz., an ounce of strenuous preparation in one’s youth is
worth a ton of prayer in one’s old age.

“Homo”: Someone once wrote that rough
football is pure football, and in the light of
that contention it can only be said that Melbourne
football is getting too pure altogether. The Port
Melbourne-Brighton match began viciously and ended
disgracefully. The Brighton rover was uppercut and
laid out in a rush, and a big 14-stoner in the
ruck was half strangled from behind, kicked in the
back, and jumped on. When he got up to inquire what
was broken he stopped a few more. The barrackers
swarmed on to the ground, and took a prominent part
in the proceedings, one of them taking off every-
thing but his 'boots and pants and offering to
fight any one or all of the Brighton team together. A
solitary mounted constable charged the riot, and, mar-
vellous to relate, dispersed it, and the game resumed and
finished without any further San Francisco trimmings.
Afterwards the referee went round taking the names of
offenders. In an unguarded moment he went to the Port
Melbourne dressing-room to get some names, and as he
put his head through the door it met a fist. It was a
knock-out, and the referee was carried off in an uncon-
scious condition, having sustained concussion of the
brain. Now there’s going to be trouble.

The Soccer authorities of England, Scotland,
Ireland and Wales have just decided that a uniform fee
ought to be paid to all professional footballers playing in
an international match. That point being settled, the
size of the fee was considered, and a three-fourths
majority fixed it at the not-extravagant sum of £4.

The £l2OO Hurdle journey at Caulfield—re-
styled the Australian Hurdle'Race—resulted in another
triumph for the loud-tongued brethren who lay the odds.
Dao-oba, a 20 to 1 chance, crawled home first, three
lengths ahead of Charlemagne, a still ranker outsider, who
was rapidlv overhauling him. But for a blunder at the
second last hurdle, Ataahua, the real good thing from the
Manifold stable, would have won in the proverbial
“walk.” Bight from the start up to the moment when
he lost his rider, Ataahua was leading as he liked,
and the mishap that put him out of it, after his
“ form ” had been so fully declared, was an exasperating
stroke of luck; for the people who had piled the coin on
the nag from Maoriland. The heavy-weights, as was the
case at Flemington last month, had no chance. Ataahua,
the runaway, carried lOst. lib., Dagoba was on the 9st.
111 b. mark' and Charlemagne had only nine stone to
hump. Yet the public, ignoring the teachings of prece-
dent, took short prices about four whose average weight
was list. 61b. Favorites for the big hurdle races are
usually selected from the wrong end of the handicap.
“Billy T.” : Friends of young Beaurepaire, the
16-year-o'ld Vie. crack sprint swimmer, are crying out for
funds to keep the champion afloat in London while
he wins some more cups and cracks up a few more re-
cords. Canada voted £3OOO to see its athletes through
during the Olympic carnival in England. Victoria sent a
bunch of good men, with scarcely money enough for
bread and cheese, and it is pretty certain that the failure
of the long-distance runners, Blake and Aitken, is due to
the fact that they couldn’t stand the racket in the mat-
ter of training. They tried to get jobs at the Exhibition
through the “Bent Three,” but Weedon, Boyd and
Davies groaned dismally and said they could do nothing
for them, not even get them into the Olympic show on the
nod. In point of fact, Les Miserables could do nothing
for themselves, and are simply lost in the shuffle. “ They
haven’t influence sufficient to take a cat in,” writes one
disgusted athlete.
The Motor Championship of Australasia will
be decided at Victoria Park racecourse, Sydney, on
September 30, and the outward and permanent sign of
victory will be a trophy, for which Mr. Joynton Smith,
the proprietor of the Victoria Park course, is donating
100 guineas. Mr. Smith will leave the Automobile Club
of Australia to manage the meeting and to purchase the
trophy ; all he stipulates is that the event shall be
restricted to 12 cars. So the apportioning of the prize
will ensure at least four good races. As the new grass
track will be opened before September 30, the cinder
track will no longer be required for horse-racing, and
Mr. Smith has arranged that the cinders shall be rolled
thoroughly into the clay below, and he guarantees that,
through frantic rolling and other precautions, the track
will be in first-class order for motor-racing by the date of
the meeting. In fact, Victoria Park course threatens to
become the motor track of Sydney—unless Providence
intervenes.

Hackenschmidt has been telling Londoners of
the dog-tricks of Yankee wrestler Frank Gotch. Not only
did he dig his thumb in the Bussian’s eye, try to burst
hib nostrils, and scratch his face like a fishwife or a cat,
but he introduced a totally hew form of wrestling. Grab-
bing the Bussian’s foot, he tried to break the bone of the
big toe, and when he was unable to attack the toe he
clawed for the eyes again. Hackenschmidt was kept so
busy protecting himself from these new methods
that he had little time to think of anything
else. He concluded a graphic description with—
“lt was not a wrestling but a butchery match.” U.S.
papers are very wild over the exposure, and describe it as
“ the veriest rot,” and allege'that Gotch is such a dude
that he wouldn’t risk damaging his beautiful finger-nails
on the Bussian’s hard optics. A jagged or untrimmed
finger-nail is his pet horror, and he wouldn’t be seen any-
where with one. In response to a general demand Gotch
has gone to England, to wrestle Hack under referees who
will not countenance wild-cat tactics. *
Yankee strong man Warren Travis struck a
peculiar brand of trouble recently. Exercising at the
Brooklyn Athletic Club, he was accustomed to lift 20
members each evening. One hot night they didn’t come,
so Travis got a platform supported on two trestles and
piled it with 30001 b. of dumb-bells and other loose iron-
mongery. Then he got underneath, straightened himself
out, and up went the platform. When he lowered it the
trestles collapsed and things fell in, and it rained dumb-
bells on Travis. A dozen members of the club struggled
with the weights and got the strong man out, unconscious.
That is the sort of person who could have earned nearly
10s. per day in Victoria loading wheat in the big bag

The Australian Cricket Board of Control scored
heavily over the Marylebone Club in the triangular con-
test business. Thanks to Jackson and others, the counties
were roused to take action, and completely upset the
machinations of the ring that was anxious to get an Aus-
tralian team to England for the mere purpose of
making money for the county clubs. So now’ the Maryle-
bone Club has cancelled the cancellation of its invitation
for 1909, turned itself inside out, and walked backwards
upside down.
Australian cricket captain M. A. Noble is a
battler' for the old brigade. Last week he told the
N.S.W. Cricket Association that there were too many
teams in the Sydney first-grade premiership competition.
The point is that the multiplicity of clubs gives more
openings for colts to achieve intbr-State and international
status, as we saw last season, when a crowd of youngjones
were given opportunities and proved themselves much
better than the old brigade. Naturally, Noble, the
champion of the old brigade, wags his ancient head
dubiously, and says things were different when he was
young. The Cricket Association does not seem impressed.
The athletes in short pants who pursue wind
and paper cross country, contested the five-miles cham-
pionship of Victoria at Ballarat last Saturday, under
circumstances that proved favorable to all concerned.
The field left the barrier at the Miners’ racecourse, and
bolted for the adjacent country, and found its way back
again in mostly Chinese file. Charlie Suffren, the local
boss ped, arrived home first, after negotiating a quantity
of barbed wire and other fences in 29rnin. 43sec. A slim
McMicken came next. Mac is just a youngster who finds
no difficulty in padding mile after mile. Of the
others, Aleck Stillwell, holder of many championships,
finished fourth, after displaying less than his
accustomed judgment. Ten teams toed the line,
and of these Essendon gained an easy victory,
placing McMicken, Stillwell, Long, and Hollow’,
amongst the first ten runners. Ballarat A team was
second, while several succumbed to the tired feeling or
got lost. Suffren, Bichardson, Crooke, McMillan, Byan,
Abbott, and Smith will probably take a hand along with
the Essendon team in the N.S.W. cross-country cham-
pionships, which occurs shortly. And, provided they
don’t run short of wind in the meantime, the Essendon
harriers should find no difficulty in annexing the Sydney
race.

When the Mclntosh, who is the head, front and
brain box of Sports and Amusements Ltd., came to look
round Sydney for a place where Tommy Burns and
Boshter Bill could decide who is best man, he could find
nowhere to match his pugs. But the Mclntosh is a man
of action, and as there w’as no convenient place he
promptly decided to build one. So, where once a Chinese
garden bloomed dow’n by the shores of.Bushcutters bay,
The Stadium is growing while you wait, and when the
structure is completed it will give 20,000 people an unin-
terrupted view of the biff and proceedings on the floor.
When the spectators are weary of watching biff they
can admire the Beautiful Harbor, and the tram will land
them at the gate. The disturbance to which The Stadium
ow’es its creation will take place on August 24, immedi-
ately after the march of the troops through the city has
ceased. The structure is to be a permanent one, and it
should prove a blessing to the city, which, m spite of its
splendid park accommodation, is very short of places for
athletic displays.

The amateur exponents of stoush and ’rastle
gathered at the Masonic Hall (Melbourne) for a season of
five nights that concluded on Tuesday of last week under
circumstances favorable to the business management.
This year’s competition drew a record entry, and a big
weeding-out was inevitable. The opening night was un-
lucky in that a number of selected entrants failed to draw
the correct tonnage, a calamity that could have been
averted by a cute stage management. For the rest of the
nights there was plenty of programme, and no hitches in
the performance. Of the two games, wrestling took first
place. The grapplers showed much improvemen ton former
years. Tilley, a pasty-faced feather, expounded with re-
remarkable vim and . skill; while W. D. Adams was
too clever for Dureau in the light section.
Beattie, a skilful and muscular youngster, was,
perhaps, the pick of the lightweight bunch, and
he went out more by ill luck than by' the superiority of
his opponent. Of the middles, M'Bonnell, a lump of
strength and determination, scored in his class. Hughie
Gunther, the heavy champion, started disappointingly,
but emerged victorious after cleverly upsetting the
lengthy person of Howard Weber, a brother of the
mighty Clarence. The boxing competitions produced a
couple of notable exponents in “Son” Williams, of Bal-
larat, and Phil Jones, of Walhalla, who annexed the
feather and middle-weight championships by means of
knock-outs. Jones is a natural fighter, with a panther-
like movement, and his arm play is disconcerting. Apart
from his punch, he’s docile and cheerful. Former cham-
pions, Harold Gray (bantam) and heavy-weight W. F.
Waldie, cleaned up their sections in workmanlike style,
though Waldie had nothing to beat, so to speak. His
two opponents were large samples but delicate as regards
their smites. Moore got a walk over in the welter, as
Buston, his opponent, got something broken in a semi-final
fray'. The star event occurred when young Jack Graham
met Henderson, of Ballarat. Thepairsailedinforstrenuous
keeps, and never lost a moment till the compulsory'
respite. It was the heartiest light-weight final since the
amateur association took a hand. The three rounds saw
Graham restrict his work to straight punching from short
range, while Henderson got in a series of swinging blows
—somewhat wild at times. Joseph Stokesbury decided
in favor of Graham. Wrestling referee Jim Beckett gave
an expert and conscientious opinion throughout, and
M. P. Adams held the managerial helm with gratifying
financial results.

“S. Snell ” : The recent amateur championship
boxing and wrestling competitions in Melbourne indicate
a very marked improvement among the amateur pugs
here and hereabouts. Formerly', Sydney non-professional
boxers could walk through any thing Melbourne had to
offer, but I doubt if the Ma metropolis could sort out a light-
weigbt to “ put it across ” young Jack Graham, this year's
champion in his class. He is a most workmanlike and
persistent scrapper who is always on top of his man, has
two crafty hands, a clever head, and a dazzling punch.
H. Gray, daddy' in the bantam class, and Williams, who
secured feather-weight supremacy, are both bright,
vigorous fighters, well up to professional quality, and
should strike hard for home and mother if they get a
call to Sydney. The heavier men I do not think so well
of. P. Jones, the hero of the tournament and easy
middle-weight winner, has a loose, open style, and
triumphed, it seems to me, by' establishing a bright blue
funk after demonstrating his possession of a remarkable
knock-down punch. However, he is the makings of a real
fighter, and is in good hands.

All accounts, and their name is legion now the
mail has arrived, indicate that Squires considerably'
astonished Burns in the scrap at Paris. Squires very
modestly put it that he gave the champion “a lot of
trouble.” There seem to have been several occasions
when Tommy Burns had to hang on for his life. The
various descriptions show that Burns acted up to the
teaching of his book, recently reviewed in this column,
and repeatedly stopped or weakened Squires’ fearsome
wallops by short, quick taps on the shoulder that was
delivering” the blow. Every success the American scored
was with the short, quick jolt. Considering that it was
Squires’ first meeting with Burns since the latter had
laid him out so suddenly at Colma, the Australian would
be naturally apprehensive, and could hardly be
expected to score a knock-out. Burns, apparently, 1
has wonderful capacity for punishment, and seems
to have taken quite a number of very heavy blpws;
in the neighborhood of the jaw. It was probably his
quickness of foot that saved him, by' enabling him to
escape the full force of the blows. French sy'mpathy is
said to have been all with Squires, whose name the
Parisians could not master at all, and when Bill got one
on to Thomas they yelled, “Bravo, bravo, Squeer;
bravo ! ” Squires having explored his man a little more
closely in the Parisian scrap may make a still better
showing in Sydney. But even should he manage to beat
Burns he will not hold the championship long. Sad to
say, rheumatism has got a hold of, him, and no rheumatic
subject can stick very closely to a game in which there
are jolts and jars. There are times when the falling of a
leaf racks the rheumatic man, and causes his valor to
cirri up within him. Writer has rheumatism himself.

Charlie Griffin, brother of big Jim of that ilk,
having raged through England’s top-notch fighters, is now
in the U.S.A., dragging the tail of his coat round among
the champions per riredium of Manager H. Pollock, the
man who introduced Young Corbett to the bruising
world. The last budget of New York papers tells that he
is likely to be matched against Abe Atteil and other lions
in his class. There seem to be more openings for light
than heavyweights in America just at present. They can
always get engagements, while the big fellows do well if
they can pull off about one fight in 18 months ; and then
they have to talk and skite themselves dry' over it.

N.S.W. Sports Club, the headquarters of
amateurism in the State, is beginning to boom. Last
year it made a clear profit of £5OO, and lifted its bank
surplus to £2OOO. Wade’s Betting Bill has done much to
increase the spread of amateurism by knocking out Holy
Moses as regards athletics, and the recent “ universal
definition ” of the amateur status has done the rest. Any
man who takes a pride in his legs has to be an amateur
now if he wants a fair chance to show them off.


SHARP HEARING
Deafness and Head Noises.
To be afflicted with deafness, or other ear diseases such
as head-noises, ringing in the ears, acute earache, dis-
charging ears, etc., and to find no cure for them in
medical or surgical treatments, as one expects to find, is
to be most unfortunate. In fact, instances of recovery
by these means are so few and far between (says the
British Journal of Health) that the number of cures on
record are very limited indeed. On the other hand it is
astonishing to note the large number of persons who have
entirely recovered from Ear Diseases and Chronic Deaf-
ness, by means of the application of Pure Natural Aural
Kinetics, which is not a surgical or medical treatment.
In proof of this statement it is of interest to cite the case
of Mrs. Jennie Stuart, of 62 Bondi Road, Sydney, N.S.W.,
whose hearing was completely restored in a few weeks
after fifteen years of ineffectual medical treatment.
According to our interviewer, Mrs. Stuart is a pro-
fessional nurse, and it can be readily understood that in
following this profession, which involves the principles
of universal love and kindness to the sick and suffering,
and their restoration to health and life, a nurse would
naturally be severely handicapped in her duties by im-
perfect hearing. Nurse Stuart undoubtedly found it so,
for not only was she skilled, but also conscientious, and
endeavored to do her duty to the sick at all times. In
this respect she found that there was always the grave
danger of not hearing the faint call of a patient in the
night asking for some necessary thing, or the correct
instructions of the doctor, to misunderstand which might
result in serious or perhaps fatal consequences. Being
true to the profession, she resolved to give up her practice
rather than to run, the great risk of endangering the lives
of any of her patients through some mistakes which
might occur through her imperfect hearing.
Nurse Stuart, having gone through every course of
medical and surgical education necessary for a fully-
qualified nurse, duly realised the great complexity of the
aural construction and the many ills this delicate
organism is subject to, and she was naturally very much
afraid of losing her hearing completely, which would be
to her a serious calamity. To avert this she consulted,
without loss of time, the best ear specialists, who, on
account of her association with the medical profession,
did all they could to cure her. To her distinct surprise
and sorrow, however, all their treatments failed, her
deafness grew worse, with roaring and ringing in the ears
continuously, which was in itself almost maddening. Her
hearing grew so bad that no matter how she tried she
could not hear the preacher in church, nor even her
friends speak distinctly. In vain she soughtamongst the
medical profession for relief from her sufferings, and,
even as drowning people cling to straws, Nurse Stuart
tried all the instruments and alleged cures advertised,
thinking that perhaps the unexpected might happen and
she might hear again as others hear.
And, in Nurse Stuart’s case, it really was the unex-
pected that did happen, for one day, after fifteen years of
suffering, she was told by a friend of the application
of Pure Natural Aural Kinetics, by means of the Baros-
cope, without drugs, electricity, or surgical instruments,
which, after great persuasion, she resolved to try, with-
out really expecting any benefit from it, as she had given
up all hope of ever being cured. Her surprise was un-
bounded when, after a few applications of this perfectly
simple treatment, she could plainly hear again the
sound of her own voice. It was to her a most happy task
to pronounce her name, and once again to hear it. Con-
tinuing with the treatment, she found her hearing daily
growing stronger, while the disagreeable head-noises and
ringing in the ears were gradually diminished. She sub-
mitted her sense of sound to repeated tests, even sitting
in the back pews of her church where she heard the
preacher quite plainly. And to-day Nurse Stuart can
hear as well as in the days of her youth, and naturally
life is brighter and happier in consequence.
All the doctors and ear-specialists who had attended
Nurse Stuart were quite surprised at the wonderful cure
so successfully accomplished in this case, after they had
given up all hope of the w'oman ever being cured.
Since then it has been proved that the Aural Kinetics
applied by the Earoscope has cured innumerable cases of
Deafness, Head-Noises, Ringing in the Ears, and various
Aural complications. The Earoscope seems to be entirely
different from all other treatments, inasmuch as it con-
tains no Drugs, no Chemicals, and no Electricity, but
simply Pure Natural Aural Kinetics, which all sufferers can
apply themselves, right at their own homes, quite con-
veniently, and perfectly safe, without the necessity of a
doctor, and without any interference to daily routine
work, business or social duties.
Anyone suffering from Deafness, Head-Noises, Ringing
in the Ears, or any other Aural complication, as well as
those interested in this subject, may w f rite for further
particulars to the Earoscope Institute, which will be sent
by them free of any charge on mentioning this paper.
The address of this Institution is :—The Earoscope Insti-
tute of Australasia, 90 Pitt Street, Sydney, N.S. W.
An Overtaxed System
Extreme Nervousness Completely Cured.
An epoch-making achievement is here dealt
with by Mr. Michael Somers, of 47 Camden
Street, Newtown, who speaks of final success
being inevitable in similar cases if like measures
are adopted. His narrative takes the following
form :
“ I was sitting down writing a letter one day
in Brisbane, feeling as well as a man could wish to
be, when I suddenly was seized with a dreadful
sensation, and collapsed. Previous to this I had
been leading a very strenuous life, working at top
pressure, and, presumably, I had overdone it.
The strongest systems will break down when
taxed too much, as I have learned to my cost.’’
“What happened,” asked our representative,
“ when you were thus attacked ? ”
“ The case looked to be such a serious one that
I was taken to a hospital in an ambulance, and
there I received the very best attention they
could devote to me. Medicine was ordered, and
everything done they could think of. In all my
travels, and I have journeyed about a good deal,
I have never met a similar case to my own. It
certainly puzzled the doctors at the institution,
for they could not make head nor tail of the cause
of my affliction.”
“Can you describe to me the feelings you had,
Mr. Somers ? ”
“Constantly recurring feelings of faintness were
as troublesome as anything—such horrible sensa-
tions as would make a man think he was going off
at any moment, and, besides, I was afflicted with
the most extreme nervousness it had ever been
my misfortune to come into contact with. When
everybody else was in bed, comfortably asleep,
was the time that my nerve troubles assumed the
greatest dimensions, and I would have given all I
possessed in the world to have been able to doze
off and get rid, for a while, of the harassing
thoughts that disturbed my mind. I could think
of nothing pleasant; every idea that came was
created in an atmosphere of adversity. I felt that
I was hemmed in by hardships and trials of all
kinds, and I think I was, too. Perhaps I was on
the point of falling asleep when, with a little
convulsive jump, I’d start up again. It was a
feeling as if my heart had momentarily stopped,
and there I’d be dreading the same thing
happening again, for fear of what might follow.
That’s the wretched way most nights went by, so
imagine my despondent, worn-out condition
during the day. Suffocating feelings badly affected
my chest, and with difficulty I succeeded in
getting my breath. Meanwhile, the sudde ’
jumping sensations in the heart’s region con-
tinued, accompanied with a terriblefaintness, which
made me often think that my time had come, and
that I surely was going, to die. Sometimes a
feeling came as if I were actually dead in parts—
a horrible kind of numbness, it was—in the
stomach, chin, and back of the neck, and again
and again I was seized with the terrible conviction
that I was going to drop dead. I was really
afraid to fall asleep in case one of these seizures
would come on, and I would never wake up again.
Oh ! how awful it was. The extreme weakness
and constant twitching of my nerves could not be
checked by anything the doctors prescribed for
me, and I had long since despaired of ever being
about in the world again, when I started, through
reading a testimonial in the paper, taking the
medicine called Clements Tonic.”
And can you conscientiously state that
Clements Tonic made you as sound as you are
now ? ” queried the writer, looking at Mr. Somers
in amazement.
“I can, indeed ; though it may seem incredible ;
but my wife and son here can vouch for what I
say being the gospel truth. The symptoms I have
described did not leave me for a long, long time,
and then only through the wonderful agency of
Clements Tonic. That is the truth, as God is my
judge. It seems like a dream to look back upon
—the hospital, the doctors, the numerous medicines
that did not apply tome at all beneficially, the
fainting bouts, the feelings of paralysis in parts of
my body, the unhappy frame of mind I was in,
the sleepless nights, the twitching of my every
nerve, the awful heart affections, and the intense
feebleness withal —yes, it seems like a hideous

Refreshingly frank statement by Professor
Watson, of Adelaide University, to an Adver-
tiser young man, who had asked him if he knew
anything of the whereabouts of the missing head
of a nigger who died at the hospital where Watson
works: —
Yes, I stole the head for the education of my students.
We must have specimens for the. students. How are we
going to teach them to do things if we cannot show them
the way to do them ? When I took the head I
obtained a cracked pot from the hospital and fixed
a splendid nose and forehead on it, and put it in
position in the coffin. It was covered with brown
paper, and if I had had some lamp black to color it you
would hardly have known it from a real head. I under-
stand the parson who made the report said his suspicions
were aroused by the lightness of the coffin. That is
rather a surprise to me, because I put so much coke in
with the artificial head that I was afraid the bottom of
the coffin would fall out.
The fragmentary state of the nig. in question
was first suspicioned by the city missionary, who
was smitten with doubts, while reading the burial
service, as to whether he was officiating over a
man or an air balloon. The gravedigger at the
foot of the coffin was holding his end with one
hand and the affable smile of one engaged on an
easy job, while his pal at the other end was
balancing his burden on three fingers or there-
abouts.
Sydney had one horribly bad joke played
upon it a few years ago, and it looks almost
possible that it may be the miserable victim of
another one. The city had been worried for 40 years
over the fact that its railway station was hope-
lessly out of the way, and for 40 years it had
clamored at itself in the effort to decide whether
it would build its new station in Hyde Park, or
further down towards George-street near King-
street, or on the other side of George-
street by Wynyard-square. The strong man
who could take the situation by the hair
and settle it never came along, so people
just went on clamoring ; and they were agreed on
nothing except that the old site was hopeless.
Then, when they were too hoarse and exhausted
with arguing over city sites to offer any
effectual resistance, an amazing politician
came along and built the new station practi-
cally on the old site—the one that had been
condemned by everybody. Now it looks as if the
same kind of horrid jest might be repeated else-
where. The need for the North Shore bridge has
been obvious for two generations. There have been
discussions about the height of it, the fashion of
it, the situation (whether from Dawes Point to
Milson’s Point, or in a triangular way, via Goat
Island to Balmain and Balls Head), and so on; as
to the need for the bridge no one had any doubt.
But through much talk, which led to nothing, the
very name of the bridge that the people want so
badly has become a weariness, and now there
seems just a chance that because the people are
too tired to keep a bright lookout, some one will
sell them instead a damp, muddy tunnel that they
don’t want at all. It is just possible for two saints
to become so mentally worn out discussing great
matters of theology that an astute and unscrupu-
lous sinner can take advantage of their mental
exhaustion to sell them a pack of cards and a dis-
reputable dog—things they wouldn’t have looked at
in their better moments. In was in an insane
moment that Sydney bought its costly and
absurdly useless railway-station, and it is quite
possible that in another similar moment it may
buy a dank, froggy hole in the ground in place of
the bridge it has been waiting for so long. Of
course it would wake up again after it had bought
the clammy and unwholesome orifice, and wonder
by what process of madness it came to do the deed,
but there would be little satisfaction in that.
“ Flinderino ” : The municipal authorities
of Cairns, in picturesque North Queensland, are
the proprietors of a payable railway running out
to the canefields on the Russell and Mulgrave
rivers. The travellers on this railway are a, mis-
cellaneous lot, and include Chinese, Hindus,
Malays, Japanese and other sundries. One
carriage on every train is set apart expressly for
these aliens, so that the white person may escape
the inconvenience of having to squeeze in between
two odorsome undesirables. But the Japanese
passengers invariably ignore the special car, and
push their way into the carriage where they know
their presence is least welcome. To the dis-
comfiture of the white travellers, Tokio and
Y.oko rest their feet on the opposite seat, light
their cigarettes, and spit all over the compart-
ment. They are mighty spitters before the Lord.
It is a common occurrence for a brace of drunken
Yappos to sprawl all over the .ti-ain, and make
themselves generally objectionable by using in-
sulting language and acting offensively. And
these little brown allies of Great Britain have
such a treacherous and truculent manner about
them that the disgusted white passengers usually
deem it best to suffer in silence.
A wail from Victoria :
Adolphus Bent, in welcoming Victoria’s new Unneces-
sary, the Carmichael vice-regal, last week, hurst into full
bloom, both sartorially and oratorically. Looking like a
poetical elephant in his Windsor uniform, and with his
tin-opener on the right side this time, Thomas Adolphus
was an extra piece of magnificence. When he waddled
on board to great his Needlessness, he flooded the sur-
roundings with eloquence, and murmured that “ this
bright day will be a presage of your Excellency’s exped-
ience during 3'our term amongst us.” Dolph had appar-.
entlv taken quite a fancy to “presage,” for he used it
later on when spouting at the House. On that occasion
he gave it a brilliant distinction by qualifying it with
“ placid,” and held forth about the “ placid presage of
the nice time you will have.” Lord knows where he dug
the word from—unless he came across it in a, herd of
verses by Jawbone Neild. But he was obviously in love
with it, since it so nicely matched his passionate uniform,
his brand-new gaud, and his abdominal protuberance.
He is getting quite a faddist in his elocution, and may be
expected to use “amorphous,” “eleemosynary,” and
such-like words with easy familiarity before long. It
wasn’t always thus. When he was plain Bent, it was
“ blooming ” and “ guts.”
A Yankee, Edwin Denby, whose father
was for a lengthy period Uncle Sam’s ambassador
at Pekin, and who has spent many years in Japan
and China, where he picked up both languages
and learned the Asiatic point of view, recently
uttered some words of wisdom that every opponent
of the Australian navy should paste in Ins hat.
He said :
Japan must do one of three things—disarm, repudiate,
or go to war. Concluding that dishonor and disarmament
are equally outside her thought, the only prospect
appears to be war. The national debt of Japan amounts
to about £5 per capita, the greater part of which is owed
abroad. Her debt has more than doubled since 1905.
Her resources are meagre. Fifteen per cent, only of the
superficial area of the country is under cultivation ; and
as a rule considerable quantities of food must be pur-
chased abroad. Her standing army now numbers at
least 300,000 men. Her navy has increased since the war
with Russia from six battleships of the first class to 11.
The empire is literally staggering under this heavy burden.
To meet the cost the people are being asked to endure
the most searching and all-permeating system of taxation
ever known to afflict a patriotic and loyal population.
They have to pay a land tax, an income tax, a business
tax, a liquor tax, a tax on soy, a sugar excise, a con-
sumption tax, a tax on textile fabrics, a mining tax, a
tax on bourses, a tax on the issue of bank notes, tonnage
dues, Customs duties, a travelling tax, a succession tax, a
stamp tax, etc. Added to these are the post and telegraph
monopoly, the salt monopoly, the camphor monopoly, the
tobacco monopoly, the railroads, and a variety of other
and special forms for extracting money from the people.
The annual land tax alone is 5 per cent, of the assessed
value, while the income tax runs from 10 per cent, on
incomes of £3O a year to 55 per cent, on incomes of £lO,OOO
a j'ear or aver. No less than 30 per cent, of the total
income of the Mikado’s people is paid to the Government
in taxes. This is a burden to make any nation stagger.
And just at hand, and comparatively without defence, is
China. What then ? Will the hungry eat ?
And farther south there lies the island continent
that forms the most lonely outpost of the white
man. And Britain’s good luck won’t last for ever.
Concerning a brace of aristocrats :
Alexis Roche, of the Ferrnoy family, who was a Gentle-
man at Large to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the
days of his hot youth, recently sued Timothy O’Brien,
baronet, late Captain in the Royal Irish Fusileers, for
slander. O’Brien had called him a swindler, and even a
Gentleman at Large can’t stand that. The trial ended
abruptly, as a juror complained that O’Brien, through a
third party, had attempted to influence his decision.
Chief Baron Palles granted a conditional order attaching
the Bart, for contempt. The first Baron Fermo3' was a
politician—Edmund Bourke Roche —contemporary with
John Sadlier, William Keogh, William Monsell, and many
discredited politicians of the early ’fifties. The original
Tim O’Brien was a Dublin pot-boy of Edmund Roche’s
day. He worked himself into the liquor trade, and was
Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1844, during the trial of O’Con-
nell, C. G. Dully and others. He gained O’Connell’s
friendship by his open sympathy with the accused. In
1849 he was again Lord Ma3 r or, and the late Queen Victoria
baronetted him when she visited the city that year. The
contemptuous Timothy has been hitherto best known to
fame as a cricketer ; till recently he was a mighty smiter
before the crowd at Lords (London) and elsewhere.
Among shipping casualties that call for a
loud explanation, the recent stranding .of the
A.U.S.N. boat, Mareeba, on Stockton beach
(N.S.W.), is in the front row of the chorus. The
Mareeba, a full-powered steamer, arrived off New-
castle after dark, and, instead of waiting in deep
water, decided to go on the beach, in sight of the
lights of Newcastle, and sit down. The A.U.S.N.
Co. has bad luck with its cargo boats. A couple
of years back the Albany ran on top of the best-
known reef on the N.S.W. coast—a landmark, so
to speak —at 2 p.m. on a fine Sunday afternoon.
More recently again, the Mildura tried to go at
right angles to its proper course, and hit Westralia
a frightful bump—frightful, that is, for the
Mildura.
Senator Dobson has been giving the Pan-
Anglican congress in England a fine sample of
Yan Diemen’s Land Christianity. At one
meeting
Senator Dobson passed scathing remarks on the Old-
Age Pensions Bill by a reflection from the system obtain-
ing in Australia. “It is rotten from first to last,” he said.
“ It teaches that State help is better than self-help.”
Well, old-age pensions only began in N.S.W. in
1902, and by the end of the next financial year
there were 22,182 pensioners on the list. There
were no pensions, and no prospect of pensions, in
the riotous youth of these men and women ; there
wasn’t anything then to teach them that “State
help is better than self-help”; and yet in their
old age they needed pensions. On the other
hand, in Maoriland, where pensions have been
paid for 10 years, the. proportion of pensioners to
total population is actually decreasing, which
knocks out Dobson’s humane idea that man
doesn’t care a hang about providing for the future
now that the State parts up a magnificent six or
ten shillings a week to keep him in affluence after
he is 65. Dobson probably doesn’t believe in life-
boats either, because it teaches captains to be
reckless, and not care a hang whether they bump
into one another or whether they don’t.
Something wonderful is the faith that the
mercantile person has in the all-pervading wisdom
of his class. At a recent meeting of the Sydney
Chamber of Commerce it was suggested, in dead
earnest, that the question of the future division of
the Customs and Excise revenue between the
Commonwealth and the States should be referred
to and decided by a committee of bankers. The
question of the division of the revenue is really
the question of Australia’s necessities. Australia
has to consider, first of all, what money it will
require to provide for defence, to open up and
settle the Northern Territory, to build its trans-
continental railways—in fact, to tackle all the great
national problems that have hitherto been allowed
to slide, but which can’t slide much longer. All
these things have to be reckoned up before a
settlement can be arrived at. And the Chamber
of Commerce has no doubt at all that one or two
men who have been trained to count dirty notes
in an office and to discount bills are the right sort
of men for the job. The confidence that Commerce
has in itself is something incredible. It would
put a bagman at the head of an army and not turn
a hair.

SKIN AND SCALP
Man Was Rapidly Losing Hair
Another Member of Family Suf-
fered with Eczema of the Hands
for Ten Years—Both Happy to
TESTIFY TO EFFICACY
OF CUTICURA REMEDIES
“I have great pleasure in giving
particulars of two complete cures de-
rived from the use of the Cuticura
Remedies.
“In my own case, for more than six
months I was suffering fr«m disorder on
my scalp and in consequence was fast
losing my hair. I was advised to give
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment
a trial, which I luckily did. I adopted
the treatment prescribed and at the end
of one month was completely cured.
This was at the beginning of 1905.
Since that time my head has been
restored to its normal state, and no
further outbreak has occurred, and
whenever I have had the opportunity
I always recommend the Cuticura
Remedies.
“A member of our family periodically
suffered for nearly ten years from dry
eczema on the hands. The fingers and
palms split and cracked everywhere at
the slightest movement. At such
periods they were most painful as well
as quite useless, and gloves were always
obliged to be worn. Every possible
remedy was tried, besides medical
advice, blood mixtures, ointments,
soaps, etc., some of which gave slight
relief for a time, but never perma-
nently. _ Finally, she was advised to
try Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Oint-
ment, which we are thankful to say
effected a complete cure, as she has had
no recurrence of the trouble for the last
three years. We are most happy to
testify to the efficacy of the Cuticura
Remedies in similar cases. Edward
Allen, 65, Denmark Road, South Nor-
wood, S. E., March 26, 1906.”
A SINGLE SET
Of Cuticura Remedies
Consisting of Cuticura Soap, to cleanse
the skin, Cuticura Ointment, to heal the
skin, and Cuticura Resolvent Pills, to
cool and cleanse the blood, is often suffi-
cient to cure the most torturing, disfigur-
ing skin, scalp, and blood humours, with
loss of hair, from infancy to age, when all
else fails.

OBESITY
PERMANENTLY CURED !
MANY people have said, “If a cure can be found
for Obesity, and one that will effectually
reduce fat without harm to the patient, the dis-
coverers would make a fort-
une.” We havefound the rem-
edy. Our main idea is just
now, however, to have you
use the treatment so that you
may help to start our endless
chain of patients.
“FATCURE” re-
moves excess fat and
cures Obesity and the
cure is permanent. It
takes off from five
pounds a week to over
two stone a month.
Many cases lose a pound
a day. It is not a patent medicine. It is
a scientific treatment by the use of vegetable
extracts in tablet form.
Mrs. 0. J. Murphy, of Glenmore Road, Pad-
dington, writes: “Your remedy reduced my
wight 37 lbs. and I now feel splendid.”

Others are being cured while

These Rings are scientifically made from
specially-prepared metals with four zinc
and three copper coils, forming a complete
battery, which have an affinity for drawing
the uric acids to that part of the finger
that the ring is worn on, and causes it to
leave the body, and at the same time
freeing the system from Rheumatism and
other kindred ailments.

“ Skull ” : The Melbourne weeklies are making extrava-
gant bids for grand odes to celebrate the coming of the
Americans. The prodigal editor of the Snorting and
Rheumatic News offers a grand prize of £2 2s. for the
winner of an ode competition, and, in a burst of extrava-
gance that hints at frenzied finance, adds : “ Consolation
prizes of ss. each will be awarded to the next four best
‘ Welcomes ’ sent in.” But this is not sufficient—it is a
great occasion and the thing must be done properly. So
the Editor rushes from one folly to another: “Other
verses of merit which may be published will be paid for
at contributors’ rates.” Now, if ss. is a prize, what in the
name of Ortcsus are “ contributors’ rates ” ?
* ♦ * *
Pearson of the Standard, who failed to buy
London Times from the Walters a few months ago, has
had better luck with T. P. O’Connor, M.P. ; and T.P.’s
Weekly and P.T.O. both pass to the Pearson proprietary 7.
The man that couldn’t buy one of his newspapers from
“ T.P.” hasn’t yet eventuated. “T.P.” has launched,
edited, and disposed of as many dailies and weeklies as
any man living. He made the London Star, and forth-
with sold out under a proviso that he shouldn’t associate
himself with a London evening daily for ten years.
Punctually to the minute, “T.P.” launched the Sun,
which, under his astute editorship, shone refulgently,
and brought in much money. When he sold the Sun he
started M.A.P. M.A.P. was the thing the great heart of
British villa-dom was panting for. It gave chatty, futile
information about duchesses, countesses, baronesses, and
so forth, even descending now and then to remarks a’rient
female baronets. Occasionally the husbands of these
ladies were mentioned. There is no journalist on earth
who equals T.P. as a Society Gossip ; so it was inevitable
that M.A.P. should be a colossal success. The customary
sale occurred. Later on P.T.O. happened along and duly
boomed; likewise T.P.’s Weekly. T.P. is a generous
entertainer, and he has a bustling little American wife,
with a passion for Doueet frocks and play-writing and
producing (expensive hobbies all); but he is never hard
up. The moment hard times appear on the horizon he
walks to Fleet-street, London, E.C., and starts another
paper.
***•*
“ Ejayem ” : Heard the other day that Maurice Brodzky
has been doing well since he left his beloved Table Talk
(Melb.) for other lands. That Brodzky could be a
journalistic success is somewhat remarkable. He cer-
tainly had fair literary ability, was well read and
well educated, yet when working for Melbourne
papers he never achieved the reputation of being a
first-class man, and on his own Table Talk he com-
pletely failed as an organiser. He couldn’t pick
men although he knew good work. He would
have been a good trainer for young ink-slingers on defined
lines, but Maurice’s trouble was that he couldn’t be
definite. He couldn’t blaze a track and follow it. He
strongly favored the personal paragraphic style of T. P.
O’Connor’s M.A.P., and he wanted “der brightness of der
Bulletin without its vulgarity.” On the whole, he had
clear ideas as to the stuff which would make a paper
successful, but somehow couldn’t get off the mark, and he
had the prevalent disease of wanting to get the product of
the journalistic brain for next to nothing. Brodzky also
labored under a permanent delusion that everybody
wanted to take him down, and hadn’t enough good Jewish
philosophy to take risks. One of his habits was to sud-
denly plank his hand down on the cash clerk’s desk and
ejaculate, “Edvard, der’s a shortage in der cash.”
When things were satisfactorily explained he would be
delivered of a groaning sigh, and clear off to look for blood
elsewhere. He always had dark suspicions “dat der
gombositors were stealing der type,” and while fretting
darkly over things like these his paper missed its chance.
If he is doing well now perhaps it is because his mind is
at rest; “ der gombositors ” are stealing another man’s
type these days—if any compositor desires to embezzle
the leaden substance.

There are still a few places in the wild and woolly West
where copper and bronze are scorned, and even the local
rag—a breezy, you-be-hanged rag mostly—asks sixpence
for itself. According to the last official list, Pt. Hedland,
Carnarvon, Marble Bar, Black Range and Lawlers were
still on the sixpenny mark. And generally the battler
who works the Archimedean lever in those parts deserves
his od.; for he has to be prepared on short notice to pick
up his press in one hand and his paste-pot in the other,
and streak with his customers to the next rush.
THE COUNTRY EDITOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I chronicle the bloated pig.
The fatted steer, the spud so big ;
Write up the pumpkin, large and round,
That wore a groov e along the ground
When growing on Gilhooley’s farm.
I chronicle the teacher inarm
Who spanks the kids at Keyser’s Ridge
Write up the need for road or bridge ;
I tell the public Murphy’s plough
Has got eight horses to it now ;
I chronicle the cow that stepped
Into the local church and slept ;
I chronicle the country dance,
And ne’er omit, by any chance
To say the “popular” M.C.
Dolled up the dance-hall “ tastefully” ;
And when the “ wee sma’ hours” arrived,
To “ wend their way home” all contrived.
I chronicle the big J.P.,
For few loom quite so large as he.
I tell how, when the swaggie died,
The J.P. hurried to his side.
And, when a “ fellow townsman ” leaves,
I tell how Dingo Hollow grieves.
O’er local weddings I enthuse
(For girls they are the best of news).
The presents always cost a lot
(Who buys the cheap ones, I know not)
I chronicle the.wondrous hen
That lays a great egg now and then.
Make one small par., without a blush,
Of “ Our Own Correspondent’s” slush.
I use the mystic weighty “ We,”
And boost the local industry.
I chronicle all happenings,
And, when the local Melba sings,
I say her “ pleasing ” youthful voice
Made all the audience rejoice.
I quote from Shakspeare, Byron, Scott,
Sometimes I’m right—more often not;
But hamlets such as this don’t know
Whence my great inspirations flow.
The dictionary on the shelf
Is no w a portion of my self.
To be obscure I often pounce
On words that no man can pronounce.
’Tis grand to be an editor,
And paste that word upon the door.
'Tis grand in verbiage to sink
And make the foolish public think
That fourteen men are on the staff
Of Dingq Hollow Telegraph.
I toil, and ever as I toil,
I burn the smellful midnight oil.
Each night and day I dream and think
Of nothing else but type and ink.
Oh! As 1 sagely wrote before,
It’s grand to be an editor !

“THE, CHILDREN’S FOOD.”
London Times, according to the cable,
talks of a “gratifying offer of help from Aus-
tralia” to put an end to the Bombay factory
strikes. The offer, it seems, came from a Vic-
torian regiment, whose honorary colonel is
Sydenham Clarke, once Gov. of Victoria, now of
Bombay. On receipt of that news the papers
tried to draw Alfred Deakin about the folly, and
Alfred the Affable obliged the reporters to this
extent: —
It has to be remembered that the territory lying near
to us in India is always liable to disturbance at any
monient, and there are, therefore, greater chances of
seeing active service there than in any other part of the
Empire.
Allowances must always be made forDeakin’s
anxiety to oblige ; but he surely doesn’t imagine
that standing in line with a lot of coffee-colored
Eurasian Volunteers to shoot down unarmed,
half-naked factory hands on strike in the
streets of Bombay is “active service!” It’s
worse than farm-burning. Some people seem to
be in a tremendous hurry to “save the Empire ”
when it’s in no danger.
A Bulletin representative went along one
afternoon last week to the official opening of the
Powell Wood Process Co.’s works at Berry’s Bay,
North Sydney. The co. claims that its process—
which consists, briefly, of boiling timber in a
solution of saccharine and other ingredients, and
then drying it in specially-constructed heating
chambers—not only seasons, and greatly improves
the grain of the wood within the brief space of
nine days, but also deducts from 20 to35 per cent,
from the weight and adds from 30 to 50 per cent,
to the strength—-the range of alteration in
both cases varying according to the sort of
timber treated. Also it is claimed for
the process that it renders timber impervious
to the devastating white ant and similar
brigands of the land and sea, and that it so
improves timbers which are almost useless as a
general thing as to make them suitable for pur-
poses never hitherto dreamt of. If the co.’s
optimism is justified it should reap a fine cash
harvest. It is stated that the Westralian Govern-
ment, alter subjecting the process to long and
exhaustive tests, has erected its own works, and
that they are capable of treating 40,000ft. per day
of the substance the Freetrader’s head is made of,
which fact wears a pleasant and hopeful aspect.
By spreading sweetness through the greenwood
tree (at a cost of about 4s. per 100ft,) the Powell
Process Co. proposes to increase enormously the
value of every forest in Australia, and Australia
can stand a lot of that sort of thing.

The Five Companies’ American Fleet Special Time-table.
N or about the
20th inst., Uncle
Sam’s fleet,
which is pound-
ing its way Aus-
traliawaras via
’Frisco, Hono-
lulu and Auckland, is due at
Sydney. As everybody knows, it is
coming on the invitation of the Common-
wealth Prime Minister, and, as everybody is com-
mencing to guess, it will provide the finest
spectacle that Australia has ever seen—or is likely
to see—for a very long time. On this occasion
Samuel is sending the pick of his fleet, about
twelve thousand seamen, besides all the latest
American idioms, and, to use one in summing up
the collection, “ the whole outfit will beat the
band.” Of course, Admiral Sperry and his cap-
tains, and the balance of the junior officers and
men are not going to provide the whole of the
entertainment. In fact, they are to be entertained
both at Sydney and Melbourne ; and both capitals
are thus developing much velocity in their prepara-
tions. There are to be illuminations, sports, aquatic
events, banquets, concerts, tea-parties, food, and
speeches—the last ranging from political down to
plain aldermanic. Furthermore, the bulk of the
functions will be open to the public, which, during
the fleet’s stay, will have two or three holidays
granted to it in both capitals. Briefly, both capi-
tals will be enfdte, and, it is quite certain, will be
crowded with visitors. From that it will be
gathered that the resources of passage between
Sydney and Melbourne by sea will be taxed to
the utmost. So the Five Companies have made
special arrangements to cope with the demand,
and, for about a week prior to the fleet’s arrival
in Sydney, will dispatch steamers from Melbourne
as under: —
Leaves Melbourne.
Cooma .. 12th Aug.
Arrawatta .. 15th „
Kyarra ..17th ~
Burrumbeet 18th „
Peregrine 19th „
Wyreema .. 22nd ~
Riverina .. 22nd ~
Arrives Sydney.
6 days before Fleet.
3 „
1 „ „
Same day as Fleet.
During festivities.
From that it will be seen
that no less than four steamers
undertake to land the visitor
in Sydney before the festivities
commence, while three will
arrive in time’to permit two
or three days’ stay before the
fleet departs for Melbourne. On
return, when the accommodation of the Five Com-
panies will be just as severely taxed on account of
the expected influx of Sydney folk to Melbourne,
steamers will be dispatched as under :
Bombala
Aratnac
Yongala
Cooma
Riyerina
Wyandra
Leaves Sydney'.
.. 22nd Aug'.
.. 25th „ .
.. 27th ~
.. 29th „
...29th „
Ist ~
Arrives Melbourne.
5 days before Fleet.
2 „
Same day as Fleet.
During Festivities.
It will be noticed that the time-tables, as above,
are as complete as the resources of the Five Com-
panies will allow, the prospective visitor in either
capital having the choice of six or seven steamers
from Melbourne to Sydney, and vice versa. And,
as return tickets are interchangeable without extra
charge, the visitor may, if he wishes, return by a
steamer other than that by which he arrived. For
instance, he may go to Sydney by the Arrawatta
and return by the Riverina, or leave by the
Cooma and come back by the Wyandra. But it
all depends upon the time at his disposal. More-
over, return tickets, on payment of a small extra
charge, are also interchangeable with those of
the railwavs.
It is estimated that during the celebrations the
populations of both Sydney and Melbourne will
be nearly doubled, visitors, of course, arriving
from all parts of Australia, and possibly from
further beyond. Consequently, hotel and other
accommodation, extensive though it is, will be all
used up. Indeed, most of it is already booked,
and at prices that would only look comfortable
from an airship. Some of the companies, with
commendable promptitude, are going to. provide
their passengers with a way out of the difficulty.
They intend to allow . those passengers wfio so
desire to remain on board while the steamer is in
port. This will naturally involve a moderate—
indeed, a very moderate—charge in addition to
the usual fare. But, as passengers by this means
are relieved of the trouble and discomfort of
hustling about for food and beds, they are sure to
avail themselves of this unique opportunity.
Again, -they will not be bothered with the re-
moval of their baggage and effects, as same will
be permitted to remain on board with them.
Altogether, the advantages arising from this inno-
vation are considerable. It is always most harass-
ing to the tourist that, as soon as he arrives in a
port, he has to hurry around for quite a while col-
lecting his trunks and boxes ; and, if his stay is to
be short, he naturally grudges the time. And, eve ll
when he has gathered up all his goods, he has to
prance about the city looking for a landlady or
hotelkeeper with a friendly feeling for the stranger
within their gates. And that pilgrimage is sure
to be dismal and disheartening.during fleet time,
unless, of course, the potential visitor has been
farsighted enough to have already booked with
some hotel or coffee palace. But it is safe to say
that the bulk of the people who are going round
to Sydney by the steamers mentioned above have
made no arrangements.” And thus being faced
with the shuddersome possibility of camping out
in the Sydney Domain, or “ dossing ” in a rug in
one of the other parks, they will obviously
welcome the suggestion of the Companies as
a wonderfully bright idea, and be so over-
whelmed with gratitude that they will want to
pay three or four times what is asked for their
bed and meals, etc. Such generosity, however,
the Five Companies will decline to accept. They
offer board and lodging at a fixed tariff—which is
extremely low under the circumstances—and will
strictiy adhere to it. Still, if anything else is
required to clinch the argument, it may be men-
tioned that it is rather cool camping out in
August.
As for Melbourne, in all likelihood the same
conveniences will be provided. As regards other
facilities, all of the steamers above mentioned will
land their passengers at Darling Harbor in
Sydney, and at the river wharves in Melbourne.
Both points of disembarkation are practically
right in the hearts of the cities, and enable the
traveller to reach the shop and commercial centres
in a few minutes Further information as to
fares, special tariff while in
port. etc., will be furn-
ished on application
to the offices of the
Companies, both in
Sydney and Mel-
bourne. But the in-
tending traveller is
urged to apply at
once, as the steamer
accommodation is
necessarily limited.

N.S.W. Parliament should make another
attempt, as early as the laws of the House permit,
to give working youngsters a minimum wage of
5s. a week. Government meanness spoilt the last
attempt, but the ensuing dissatisfaction has
probably cleared the minds of Wade, Wood and
co. The Wade gang should remember that Hector
favored 5s. as a minimum. He calculated that it
meant only £105 per week extra over all the fac-
tories of N.S.W., and pointed out that the aboli-
tion of stamp duty would more than cover that
outlay. Hector was throwing bait for workers’
votes at the time, but Wade, Wood, Hogue and
co. profited, and they should now redeem Hector’s
paper, if for no other reason than that Hector
issued it in the name of the firm.

“Bays water ’’remarks (B. 9/7/’0S): “Few have heard
of Morlev, the pioneer.” Well, I’ve heard and read of
pioneer Morley and his two mates until I’m about “ fed
up.” I read about them in the Herald, and after wading
through column after column detailing their clearing,
fencing, and road-building exploits, 1 was just in a
beautiful state of thrill, when the Herald, in winding up,
remarked casually that these pioneers had got no return
from their land for eight years! I give the young fellows
all credit for their strenuousness ; but consider the humor
involved in striving to make industrial martyrs of three
able-bodied young Australians, who, in addition to having
a surveyor to pick out their selection, had money or
backing to last eight long years. Eight years ! Why,
most pioneers reckon themselves lucky if they have suf-
ficient cash to render them independent of their land for
as many months.

Varicocele Can Be Cured!
THE CAUSE OF MORE WRECKS THAN ANY OTHER DISEASE.
IT CAN BE CURED BY ELECTRICITY.
Thousands of men have Varicocele and are ignorant of the harm which may result. They only know that something is
draining the vim and ambition from their bodies and brains, and know of no reason to account for it. This terrible
affliction is the most treacherous, silent and certain in its work of all known ailments. It comes on without apparent cause,
and never ceases in its destructive influence until it robs a man of all his vitality and leaves him a physical and mental wreck.

DRUGS ARE USELESS!
for the cure of Varicocele and its concurrent or attending weaknesses. Applied exter-
nally or internally drugs usually prove either ineffectual or injurious. There are many
ways of treating it, but none is so sure of success as properly-applied Electricity. We
have devoted twenty years to the study of Electricity for the cure of this and kindred
ailments, and have cured 5000 cases of Varicocele. We have cured cases of thirty years
standing, where the patients had exhausted all other known treatments without relief,
and who came to us in a state of complete debility. DR. MCLAUGHLIN’S
ELECTRIC BELT and electric suspensory —our method—has cured after the
knife, injection, ligation and every other known means had failed. We have cured
physicians, lawyers, ministers, merchants and laborers. We use a method of our
own ; one which is the result of vast experience during the past twenty years. We have
an electric body battery which can be worn comfortably while the patient sleeps at
night, and which gives a powerful yet soothing current that is always under control.
It pours its vitalizing energy into the body for six to eight hours every night in a
manner which dissolves the congestion, assists the circulation, gives contraction to
relaxed cords and restores strength. If you are tired of useless drugging and have spent
your time and money without benefits, write to-day. We have made over 50,000
people strong and vigorous, and they never tire of praising our wonderful remedy.
it is a positive cure for all Weaknesses, Nervousness, Varieoeele, Loss of Vitality, Stomach,
Kidney and Liver Troubles, Rheumatism, Sciatica and Lumbago, and when used with our
newly-patented electro-plastic truss, is a certain Cure for Rupture. . . . It is easy to use ; no Sting 1 ,
burn or shock ; put it on when you go to bed, and you get up in the morning feeling like a two-year-old
colt. They are guaranteed to give a strong current, instantly felt, and have special attachments for men.
They are within the reach of all; price £1 and up. Beware Of Cheap imitations.

“ Galleryite, ” more in misery than in
rage
Adolphus Bent’s Assembly, which has developed the
hustle of au hibernating mammal, is knocking large
sparks off the surface of sloth. It meets three days a
week now, and reckons that, by bashing the trivial to a
standstill, and by assaulting the inane when it isn’t look-
ing, it will be able to last out the session without having
ap'p'roaehed that suggestion for the suppression of dubious
substances in kapok. The other 'Thursday, finding time
sitting heavily on its aggregate stummick, and
not, knowing whether that or work was the
greater weariness, it decided to take on a little
exercise. Th reupon, Downward whistled up his Scrip-
ture R ferendirm petition, which is quite tame now ; and
Willie Watt gehtly led in a narrative of fearsome age con-
cerning a suppressed report on the Museum, or some-
where. Following, came Prendergast with that inter-
national dispute of his regarding the payment of railway
pensions. Then funny Old Tory McCutcheon must spout
some of his rich prose upon the Lara Inebriates Institute,
and Livingstone beckoned in a brutal grievance anent the
loans of books to country mechanics’ institutes. Quite a
long time was spent over fish-hatcheries, and Billy Watt,
or Watt-not, pounced in with a suggestion to teach
policemen the art of wrestling; while the exquisite
Bayles, of Toorak, was delivered of some entrancing
opinions on motah-cahs. Then the Assembly shut up at
afternoon-tea time.
One*of the most enthusiastic apologists for
the Bent regime in Victoria is at present Donald
Mackinnon, who, needless to remark, has a seat
in the Cabinet. Yet there were days—and fairly
recent days, too—when Mackinnon sat in Opposi-
tion, and was an outspoken critic of the bulky
knight. Then he had much to say upon the
appointment of Taverner as the Victorian Agent-
General in London at a salary of £1000 a year.
But those days are past. He says nothing nowa-
days that could be construed into the remotest
resemblance to censure. He has been practically
silenced by office, and, when he can find sufficient
courage to speak, blathers of “the extraordinary
manner” in which Bent “induces people, who
were hostile to him, to vote for him.” Mac-
kinnon, in effect, admits himself a victim to
Tommy’s extraordinary manner. And, Heaven
knows, Tommy’s manner is extraordinary enough.

CHITIS
CURE.
The Famous Remedy for
Coughs, Bronchitis, Pneumonia,
Pleurisy, Asthma & Consumption
BRONCHITIS and PNEUMONIA
Cured by
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE
After other Treatment had Failed.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —From a Strict 'sense
of duty I feel that I should publish the'following state-
ment, so that others may know what to do when the
awful fact is evident that a life is in danger of being
lost: —In September, 1906, my little girl, aged at that
time 3 years, contracted Measles, and in the following
October was attacked by Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and
Congestion of the Lungs. She was attended by a
legally qualified doctor of high standing, ' but his treat-
ment was not successful in arresting the progress of; the
illness. On Saturday, the 21st October, 1906, he said
that her life was in danger—that there was very little
hope for her. For eight days and nights she had been
prostrated by Cough, Pain and Fever, and was lying
like a statue, unconscious. At this stage I was per-
suaded by a friend to obtain Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure,
with its auxiliary medicine' for the Fever and Conges-
tion of the Lungs, as directed in the Catalogue of
Medicines which accompanies each bottle of the Bron-
chitis Cure. I gave the medicine as directed, and there
was an improvement from the dose of Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure. The improvement continued after
each dose of the medicine. In a week she was perfectly
free from the Pneumonia, Congestion, Cough, Pain and
Fever, and was well, except that she was still weak. In
a fortnight she was quite recovered, and is. now in
splendid health, and stronger than ever. Any person
asking for information about this grand medicine can
be supplied by me, or by any of my:neighbours who have
witnessed its wonderful effects. It absolutely snatched
my child from an early grave.—Yours gratefully,
D. GARDINER,
Police Station, Geelong East, Feb. 5, 1908.
BRONCHITIS.
A Sufferer 73 Years of Age.
Thoroughly Curec' by Two Bottles of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Immediate Relief Effect Wonderful.
Mr. Hearne. Sir, —I was very ill with Influenza
and Bronchitis. A friend of mine persuaded me to try
your Bronchitis Cure. The first dose gave me imme-
diate relief, and after' taking the second bottle I am
thoroughly cured. Its effect on me has been most
wonderful. I am 73 years of age. I trust you will
make use of this statement by publishing it for the bene-
fit of humanity generally. Yours most respectfully,
THOMAS R. TREZISE.

PNEUMONIA and PLEURISY
cured by
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE
After other Treatment had Failed.
I, Prudence M‘Kee, of Carr-street, South Geelong, in
view of the importance of a person making it. quite clear
what treatment was successful in curing a serious and
complicated case when the medicine, directions and treat-
ment of a legally qualified doctor had failed, state as
follows: (
My son, Henry M’Kee, then aged 8 years, had been
attended by a legally qualified doctor, who pronounced
him to be suffering from Pneumonia, Pleurisy and a
stoppage of the passing of Urine. Under the doctor’s
treatment the child gradually got worse, and the doctor
pronounced the case hopeless. He told me that the
child could not live. At this stage I obtained from
Mr. W. G. Hearne, Chemist, of Geelong, a bottle of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure,, and gave it to the child, ac-
cording to the directions which accompany each bottle
of it. The child improved after the second dose of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure. He continued to improve
each day from each dose of Hearne’s Medicine alone, and
within three days, he was free from the Cough, Pneu-
monia and the Pleurisy, and the Urine was passing satis-
factorily. He was out of bed at the end of a week,
completely recovered, and he is now in perfect health.
PRUDENCE M’KEE,
Carr-street, South Geelong, Feb. 6, 1908.
CONSUMPTION.
Too 111 to Leave His Bed.
A Complete Cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir, —I am writing to tell you about the wonder-
ful cure your medicine has effected in my case. About
three years ago I began to cough. At first the cough
was not severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became
very weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my
chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On several oc-
casions there was blood in the expectorated matter. I
had been treated by a doctor who pronounced my case to
be consumption, and various other treatments had been
tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage that I
heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a
course of the medicine. When it arrived. I was too ill
to leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually imnroved. lam glad to say that the two
lots of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure,
for which accept my very best thanks. —Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR,
Westminster Bridge-road, S.E., London.
BRONCHITIS and PLEURISY.
A Severe Case Cured by Two Bottles of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
After Other Treatment had Failed.
Mr. Hearne, Chemist, Geelong.
Dear Sir, —Some months ago, in Sydney, I suffered
from a severe attack of influenza, and was confined to
my room for about a week, at the end of which time,
feeling somewhat better, I got up and tried to transact
my business as usual. But I got up too soon, for the
very next day I had a relapse, and suffered tortures from
what the doctor told me was pleurisy and bronchitis.
The pain from the former in my chest and shoulders
was frightful, and for four long weeks I was confined to
my bed under the care of a well-known Sydney doctor,
and all the time his medicine gave me but temporary
relief. The landlady of the hotel (the Cleveland), where
I resided, told me of a medicine —Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure—from Victoria, which had cured her of a bad at-
tack of bronchitis and pains in the chest, and begged
of me to try it. I did so, and, in thanks and gratitude
to you, tell you that, after the second bottle, my cough
had ceased; but what is more astonishing, the pains from
pleurisy entirely left me, and in about a week I was able
to attend to my duties as usual.—Yours faithfully,
J. BRAHAM.

ASTHMA-A 17 YEARS CASE.
Previous Treatment Failed.
Cured by Three Bottles,
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, wrote:—“ After suffering from asthma for
seventeen years, and having been under a great many
different treatments without benefit, I was induced to try
Hearne’s Medicine for Asthma. After taking three
bottles of this medicine I quite got rid of the asthma,
and since then, which was the beginning of 1883 —fifteen
years ago—l have not had the slightest return of it.
The medicine quite cured me, and I have much pleasure
in recommending it.”
Speaking in February, 1908, he states: —“I am keeping
very well. Never haVe the slightest return of the asthma.”
“ Hearne’s Medicine cured me of Asthma, from which
I had been suffering for twenty-five years, during which
time I had used almost every patent medicine on the
market—including asthma inhalations—without getting a
cure. It was 8 years ago that the cure was effected
by Hearne’s Medicine, and I now feel stronger than I
have felt for years—in fact, I feel splendid.”
C. WISEMAN,
Meredith, Victoria.
Beware of Imitations ! The great success of HEARKENS Bronchitis Cure has induced a number of
unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of deceiving
the unsuspecting, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that HEARNES
BronchitiS Cure has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact, and to request you
in your own interests tc be particular to ask for HEARNE’S, ana see that you get it.

of the disease—and that is the story of the cures
effected by the use of DR. SHELDON’S NEW

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SHE was loaded gutter deep.
She was loaded fore and aft ;
She could hardly seaward creep.
And the waiting storm it laughed.
For it knew the steamer had too much to carry,
And it knew the crew would never get ashore ;
So the sailor who’d been fool.enough to marry
He would never see his darling any more—
Nevermore !
He could say “ Good-bye ” to her for evermore.
She was loaded on the surge
With the sort of stuff that pays,
And the gale it hummed a dirge
In the trembling funnel stays.
But she’d staggered home before and brought her
cargo
Like a woman who’s been shopping down the
street;
So they didn’t lay the possible embargo.
Oh ! They didn't know the gale she was to meet!
Hail and sleet !
With a maddened sea ’twould take a ship to beat.
She was loaded like a house ;
She was loaded up to die ;
And the storm held high carouse
When the bridge rang down “ Stand by !”
So she started deep and weary on her journey,
And the hungry water lapped about her hull;
For the ocean it was ready for the tourney,
And a scream of fear came from the frighted
gull—
Oh ! the gull
Winged in horror from the deep, corpse-heavy
hull.
Slow and heavy did she turn
Till she faced the crouching sea;
For she had her freight to earn
Tho’ she risked Eternity.
And the last of storms came savagely to meet her
As she reeled and staggered onward through the
night;
For the hand of God had written it should beat
her,
Just because the hand of Man had not been
light
C Was it right ?)
Overloaded, she plunged swiftly out of sight.
Oh ! the liner she can dance,
So she’s nursed with jealous care ;
But the coasters take their chance,
And the wrath of God they dare.
Unassisted by Authority’s embargo
And the laws that make for safety on the deep,
They are loaded gutter-deep with too much
cargo,
And they either sink or swim—for they are
cheap
(Very cheap !) —
Little ships and sailormen are very cheap.

The Way of the Transgressor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I AM to be married to-morrow.”
Albert whitened. May was his sweet-
heart. Was it pique? No, it couldn’t be
true. She wanted to force his hand, that was all.
They were walking along the elm avenue in the
Fitzroy Gardens, a path they had traversed many
evenings together—a young man and a girl.
The stars glittered brightly. The gardens were
heavy with rich perfumes. The air seemed
charged with lovers’ vows. It was all very seduc-
tive on a still summer’s night.
“Married !” the young man scoffed. “That’s
a poor ending, isn’t it?”
Albert was a bank teller with a romantic turn.
“I thought you loved me, as you used to—as
you do now,” he added, holding her hand and
ie iding her over the lawn to a favorite seat under
a Moreton Bay fig.
“No, Bert,” she said, “it’s all over. I’m fond
of you, but you won’t marry me.”
“It’s not possible,” he said.
“ Why, Bert? ”
Albert lit a cigarette, and watched a ’possum
swinging up a tree.
“ The bank might object. Besides”
May interrupted him.
“ I can’t be denied the pleasures other girls
enjoy. I want to see life. You have taught me
that. I can’t breathe at home.”
Albert posed as the deliverer of suburban girls
who had to be home before half-past ten.
“ Night after night I have tried to tell you, but
it was too cruel, for I love you better than any-
body else in the world. What could Ido ? ”
The young man felt the shiver of the leaves and
the tremble of her hand. He allowed May to kiss
him.
“Woman is only one creature in different
dresses,” he considered. “Woman does not
understand an ideal.”
Mayslipped an arm round his neck. “Bert,
won’t you marry me now ? It is not too late. I
love you. We’ll risk everything.”
Bert thought his suspicions were well founded.
He, a man of the world, could not be tricked by a
girl’s clumsy device.
He smiled to himself, but said, “You have
shattered my dream ; you have broken my faith.”
“G’arn, Charley, ye’re kiddin’.”
Bert started. It was a couple smoodging in the
grass. ”
* * * *
It was at a show, during the first interval.
He had seen her in the front row of the circle,
looking radiant in pale blue. Blue alwavs suited
her best. He had no eyes for the play.
This woman loved him, he was sure of that. The
conquest of a married woman would be a romance.
Danger lent a spice to the adventure.
They met in the foyer. She was with her
brother. Her husband was out of town. He
was always out of town.
Bert asked if he might call.
May would be delighted.
In the lounge they lingered over an ice The
strains of the orchestra floated into the chattering
room.
“ Come soon,” she said, smilingly, as they rose
from the table to pass through the corridor clouded
with cigarette smoke.
Their eyes met all that evening.
IS ext day he called. She had a charming little
villa at Hawthorn, with a garden running down
to the river. May brought afternoon tea. Every-
thing looked very comfortable.
lliey chatted of old times. Bert was an in-
teresting young man. He was full of fads,
or rather pretended to be, quite unlike the
husthng but dull Travis. So little put Bert out—
hurt him,” as he said. A speck of dust, a
soubrette with a loud voice, an omelette a shade
overdone, a cigarette that didn’t draw freelv, a
hat that didn’t match a particular girl’s tempera-
ment all such trifles Bert pretended to regard
as gross violations of the eternal proprieties, and
seemed greatly perturbed by them.
Bert s susceptibilities were very delicate.
He offered her a cigarette.
No, she had given up smoking since she had
married.
Bert regretted that marriage, which, after all,
was but a social convention, should so stifle one’s
individuality; for it was by minor revolts, he
contended, that one’s soul gained freedom.
May thought she would try one, for old time’s
sake.
They sat together on the sofa. Bert held her
hand.
“You can’t be happy, May. He’s very kind, I
know, very considerate ; they all are.”
“Don’t, Bert, please.”
But he has no claim on you. You are mine
by right of love. He is the usurper.”
May put down her cigarette.
“ Do you really love me so much, dear ? ”
“Better than the world,” he said, kissing her.
“O, why did you let me marry him ? ”
“Who can contend against Fate? By moral
law you are mine now.”
“I feel that, too.” May was very earnest.
“We must do something. My future depends on
you.”
The bank clerk wanted to be her lover, not
another husband.
“No,” he protested. “lean never consent to
make a pariah of you. You are not strong enough
to fight Society. With a man it’s different, but a
woman” .. . .
Albert opened his lips, from which a cloud of
smoke slowly issued. It was very expressive.
Heavy steps were heard in the passage.
Bert started, and shifted his seat.
Travis entered.
He was a big, hearty, whisky-flushed man of
40, with the cheery confidence of the commercial
traveller. He kissed his wife boisterously and
hailed Albert like an old friend.
“Been to the club,” Travis laughed; “beat
the poker machine twice. Try one of these.” He
handed over his cigar-case.
The clerk took one, though he never smoked
cigars.
The clock struck six.
“ Didn’t know it was so late,” he mumbled,
groping for his hat.
“But you told me you would stay to dinner,”
May pleaded.
“Forgot,” replied Albert; “have to go back
to the bank.”
“ What a brute !” he reflected, walking to the
station. “ Plow unfitted I am for any physical
encounter. Curse these cigarettes. I’ll have to
give them up and learn boxing. That animal’s
too gross to see the subtlety of the position. He’s
an impossible enemy. He’s too sordid.”
Whenever Albert called on May he was torn
between love and fear. His visits, though fre-
quent, were brief. Travis might break in at any
moment. As it happened he never met Travis
again, but he felt his position beset with danger.
What could he do ? May would run away with
him, but that was all. Their affection remained
Platonic. He had not the courage. He wanted
the fruit without climbing the tree. Every city
is filled with young men who would emulate Don
Juan if they had his skill and audacity. They
would play havoc with many homes but for the
husband. They would be dashing heroes if there
were no villain to encounter.
Albert found the way of the transgressor hedged
with danger.
Sandow exercise was too strenuous.
* * * *
While discussing the relative merits of Dayles-
ford and Lome as holiday resorts, Albert received
a letter from May. Travis had been transferred
to bydney, and May invited her old sweetheart
to come over.
It was the proper thing to have a liaison with a
married woman. Many of his friends boasted of
such conquests. Albert had to be in the fashion.
But May wanted all or nothing. bo far his
plans had been unfulfilled ; now he would carry
her off in triumph.
On a secluded seat upon a iNorth Shore terrace,
overlooking the moonlit waters of the Harbor, the
cliffs and coves, the lights of great ships,’ ihe
shooting ferry boats, the haze of the mysterious city
—inspired by Nature’s romance, Albert decided
that they should begin life afresh.
May drank in his words eagerly.
She had felt the situation keenly. Either, she
resolved, they must meet no more, or they must
go away somewhere together. There was no
course between. No longer must they be untrue
to themselves and to him.
Travis was away, as usual, and might not be
back for three days.
They had plenty of time. They would start
to-morrow, else—
“ Our life begins to-morrow,” saiu Albert, “be
prepared.”
Ten minutes later a young man paced up and
down the little pier, waiting for the town boat. A
big red man was watching him.
“My God ! he has discovered us.” Albert
staggered against a pole.
The man struck a match and lighted a cigar.
Travis was always lighting cigars.
“What will he do? Why doesn’t the brute
move? Why doesn’t he speak? My God ! Why
doesn’t he make the attack ? ”
The boat slipped in.
Albert waited, numb, on the pier. The man
waited, too.
The whistle blew.
Albert staggered towards the gangway. The
man followed him.
~“ W J iII h, e shoot? Will he use a knife?”
Already Albert felt the steel piercing his flesh. It
was horrible.
If he escaped—the thought flashed on him—he
vvould renounce May—there was nothing between
them and rush back to Melbourne. But he
couldn’t escape. It was too late.
The man grew nearer.
.There was the Harbor. Albert stepped to the
jrink and looked into the water. A cigar flame
flashed into his eyes. He turned with a strangled
cry, dashed past the man, and ran for his life
towards Parramatta, 20 miles away.
The way of the futile transgressor is hard
A disinterested stranger, puffing a cheap cigar
want aboard and took his place on the smoking
deck. His name was Simpson. As he sat down
he wondered a little why the young man in front
of him had turned and run away. Then he began
thinking about a horse. "

No preparation has been
so successful in the
soothing and healing of
all kinds of injuries as
Zam-Buk, the herbal
Balm that is kept handy
in nearly every home.
Zam-Buk is unequalled
for cuts, bruises, burns,
stiffness, abrasions,
chaps, chilblains, rheu-
matism, eczema, piles,
ringworm, boils, ab-
scesses, and all dis-
eased, irritated or
inflamed conditions of
the skin. 1/6 and 3/6
per pot, of all chemists
and stores.
Zam-Buk Balm Conquers
All Beep-seated Pains.
When you have any deep-seated pain in the joints,
the hack, the wrists, or elsewhere, place a supply
of Zam-Buk Balm on the fingers or palm of
the hand, and rub it in. The penetrating power
of this “ embrocation-balm ” kills pain and removes
stiffness.
Sound rubbings of the affected parts with this
wonderful balm will drive out all pain, reduce swelling,
strengthen the skin and tissues (enabling them to
resist cold and damp better during the winter
months), and restore perfect elasticity and looseness.
Zam-Buk Balm is without an equal as an embro-
cation for rheumatism, sciatica, lumbago, neuralgia,
gout, and other affections of the fibrous tissues o
the body. Keep a pot handy and rub it in.
Mr. Gr. Parkinson, of the Maylands Dyeing and gleaning
Works, North Avenue, Maylands, Perth, W.A., says:—-“I suf-
fered from rheumatics and stiff joints for a number of years,
especially in the winter time. I was hardly able to get about,
and resorted to the usual home remedies in the way of hot
baths and rubbing with sundry liniments and embrocations, but
all to no avail. Some months ago a friend, knowing how 1
1 suffered, recommended me to give Zam-Buk Balm a trial,
which I happily did. I derived great benefit from the first
three or four applications, the wonderful soothing and easing
effect being very gratifying. Persevering with Zam-Buk, lam
most glad to say the pains and stiffness disappeared.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH ! we’re nosin’ through the wet fog o’ the
Western Ocean route,
An’ our old tank’s pitcliin’ badly an’
behavin’ like a brute.
For the thrust thread valve wants seatin’, an’
we’ve not a light aglow
When a siren screams out hoarsely; then it’s
“ Hard a-starboard, oh 1 ”
As I send the wheel a-spinnin’—like a floatin’
music ’all--
A big liner clears our bow-plates ; from her bridge
there comes a call:
“ Where’s yer lights, ye sons o’ darkness? We’ll
report ye in the ‘ log.’ ”
Then our Old Man cries sarcastic, “Ye can’t
see ’em for the fog.”
. Tramp, tramp !
,Just' a battered tramp 1
Engines always goin’ wrong—
Crawlin’ till we camp
In some far, sin-stricken port,
Gawd-forgot, an’ shaped in sport,
Earnin’ owners’ dividends a-trampin’.
When ye’re standin’ at the winch-guides with the
sun at ninety-five,
Then ye swear ye’ll get a shore job if ye struggle
home alive.
There’ $ the 01,d Man drinkin* “coolers” —Lord !
how you could do a beer !
But yer thoughts are rudely shattered by the sour
Scotch engineer..
Ye,have let yer fingers wander, an’ ye’ve rasped
two pinion teeth ;
An’ he blanks yer soul to blazes as he dives away
beneath
To get up his file an’ hammer ; so ye snatch a
moment’s rest
While yer thoughts go back to Sydney an’ the gal
ye like the best.
Tramp, tramp !
Just a rusty tramp !
Deck plates sweating with the heat.
Mouldy bunks and damp.
Graft in port with blistered skin,
On the ocean shiverin’.
Shareholders buy motors through yer trampin’.
As ye’re rollin’ in the oily swell outside some
Asian port
Ye pick a “home” noospaper up, an’while ye
read ye snort.
It tells yer in the parrigraff that’s topped
, “Society,”
How Mister Owner’s entertained some Royalties
to tea,
An’ that he giv’ a thousand quid for heathen
mission work;
But lie grudges you yer wages, an’ has tastes like
any Turk.
In the swellest o’ the cafes, with some dazzlin’
Nell or Fan,
He drinks cham. upon the quiet, sweated from the
sailorman.
Tramp, tramp !
Just a poachin’ tramp !
Sneered at by the liners smart
As an ocean scamp ;
Plungin’ through the icy seas,
While the boss gives “ Garden Teas ”
To princesses through your sweat in trampin’.
Ye have “done” yer “bit” ashore, an’now, of
course, ye’re stony broke.
There’s a concert at the “mission,” so ye lounge
in for a smoke.
He’s a decent chap, the “pilot,” an’ he doesn’t
start to rant;
Wus at sea himself, an’ knows as we don’t want
to hear no cant.
Ye know to-morrow mornin’ ye’ve to join yer ship
again ;
An’ ye wonder sorter dully if the place for sailor-
men
When ye pass to Davy Jones’s (which at last gets
each sea scamp)
Will be free from shoutin’ skippers an’ the mates
Who run the tramp !
Tramp—tramp !
Just a worn-out tramp !
Glad to go to Davy Jones
In his kingdom damp.
P’r’aps there’s left a little bit
Where the sailorman can sit
Safe from owners orderin’ him a-trampin’.

JOHN MEIGHAN.
The Strike.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ £7l HE’S struck ! ” All four men said it
at once. Everyone on board said it.
Even those who had never been on a
ship before could not help knowing what that
bump meant.
“Hearts led, mind ! ’’ said the foremost of the
four as they scrambled up the companion.
There was nothing to be learned in the wild
confusion on deck.
Not that there was much noise, only dumb
horror as yet among the passengers, and a mad
scuttling up and down everywhere of the ship’s
people. They were all hurrying in different
directions, and the method of their haste was not
apparent to the layman. And they wouldn t
speak—these flying men, some of them bare-
footed and half undressed ; they wouldn’t give
out a single word even to those they were on quite
familiar terms with a minute before! They just
brushed you away, as if you were a fly, so that no
particulars were ascertainable.
“She’s struck!” That was all. White-faced
women, trying to realise it, said it, and every
plank and rope in the ship seemed to say it“l’ve
done my part, and am as good as ever, but it’s all
over now. I in not an atom of use any more -
she’s struck ! ” The electric bells, too, ringing
out all over the place in the awful stillness of the
stoppage of the screw, said \t; and more definitely
and gorgeously a hissing rocket that sped away up
into the black sky from the bridge said it.
Then, all that being over—a year compressed
into a minute, as it were—things began to be
uncomfortable on deck, and there wasn’t room to
move for the dressed and the, undressed, and
scenes ensued,! and there was a scramble for life-
belts and all that, and children howled—which
they well might, if they knew there were not
enough boats for them and the women, let alone
the men.
“She’s done! Come on! Let’s get out of
this ! Hearts led !'”
“ An’ diamonds trumps ! ”
And the four men went down to their game
again. No one had disturbed their cards, every-
body being on top. They had hardly stirred from
those four seats all the trip, and had acquired a
sort of right to them. Now, bar sundry unwonted
signs of activity overhead, and a child near the
skylight that would cry because it was its nature
to, things down there were exactly the same as at
any time during the last fortnight, and the players
were more free from disturbance than ever.
Presently a man, youngish, clerky-looking,
came in, pale and preoccupied, and went to
another table.
He was holding a bottle in one hand and a cork
in another, and he held a folded-up note between
his lips.
“Hullo, Martin, taking to drink over it?”
But he put the bottle on the table, and, rolling
the paper up small, dropped it down the neck and
put the cork in.
“ Message for the girl, eh ? Put ono in for me.”
Martin held the bottle upside down and banged
the cork of it on the table until he had driven it
home.
“ Easy ! You’ll burst it! ”
He eschewed the ribaldry, and walked out with
the bottle under his arm, and they went on with
their game. Even some of the panic-stricken
overhead took a kind of fascinated interest in
looking down at them through the open skylight.
It looked so reassuring to see those men playing
cards all the while. It was the only bit of the
world that they were so soon going to slip away
from that was looking just as it used to —before
“ she struck.”
There were other shows. On the poop people
were grouped round a man who was leading them
in prayers and hymns, and there were the boats
being launched, and the rockets to watch.
Presently the man with the bottle came ex-
citedly down into the saloon again. Going into
his cabin, he came out with a corkscrew, and
vainly tried to draw the cork he had shoved in so
tightly. He held another folded note between his
lips.
“ Nota bene ! ”
“ Postscript ! ”
One of the men of weight and substance had
the manners to hold out his hand to the straggler
in his helplessness, and with a strenuous effort
drew the cork for him.
“Have,you any idea, Martin,” said another,
“where that bottle of yours is going to before
your girl gets hold of it? First it’ll go down
past Kerguelen Island and get frozen in. Then,
when the thaw comes, it’ll run up north, about 20
miles a day, to the Crozets, and get into the equa-
torial current and sail past Rio and San Roque.
Then it’ll do the Gulf Stream and turn round by
the Bay of Biscay, arid down the Guinea current
past Cape Colony, and across the Atlantic again
to the Horn, making for Maoriland, and then
down to the South Pole and be frozen in. Then
it’ll come up here, if it has time. As sure as
you’re standing there, that is where that bottle’ll
go, and it will take 80 years to do it! That is, of
course, bar side currents—they might send 1 it
ashore anywhere. Hullo ! Nothing but trumps ?
I spoilt your march !”
“Ah! Here she comes.”
A small gutter of water made its way in from
the passage and began to spread over the floor! as
the man went out with his bottle.
Meanwhile, two of the boats were in the water
and loaded. There were only four of any account,
and all the men, bar the boats’ crews, were booked
to stay on the ship.
One of the first women in boat No. 1 was a
giantess in width and took up the room of three,
and had two lifebelts fixed round under her arm-
pits. That was all right, but when the mate came
across Hutton, a second-class passenger, walking
about the deck fully dressed and swelled out to
about double his size, he made him take off his
overcoat, and underneath he had four lifebelts
round him, and he got properly shown up. The
mate said he’d have him thrown overboard with-
out any belt at all if he caught him taking more
than his whack again. Hutton was a human pig,
and e vervone was glad—for a shipwreck—tosee him
sat on. The children were all wearing lifebelts, and
some were running round enjoying the novelty of
it and comparatively unconcerned. But one of the
youngsters with a preternatural sense of danger,
the one near the skylight, had done nothing ever
since “she struck ” but howl and howl.
You could find anything on deck—lovers clasped
in each other’s arms, men left on board saying
good-bye to their wives in the boats, women
huddled in corners praying by themselves, people
rushing backward and forward from one end of
the ship to the other looking for somebody. Gne
young sailor fellow was stalking round with a baby
in arms that the mother had managed to madly
dump on to him somehow, and he couldn’t find her
anywhere. And in all the fuss there was a crowd
two or three deep round the skylight watching
the men playing cards in the water.
One officious party was scandalised at it, and
loudly denounced it as “ suicide, ” and went and
got hold of the mate at last. He told the mate
that there were four men down below playing
euchre, and that he, the mate, should “order
them up.” But the mate said the officious party
was too funny to live, and bade him go to ——.
“Gripes! that was a lurch. Is she going to
take a header ?”
“ I don’t know, but you’ve trumped my trick !
“Of course —yours or anyone else’s,” and he
put out the joker.
The place was on the tilt now. The water had
been about six inches up the legs of some of the
seats, and they had been squatting on them Turk
fashion, but now they got on to the table and sat
on a level with the cards while the water came up
and slopped about to within an inch or two of
them on the lower side, and, everything being
on the slope, they had to look after their
equilibrium. .
During a deal, the unoccupied players had time
to notice that the audience had gone. There were
no more faces at the skylight. Those on deck
were making for the higher parts of the ship.
Then the dealer, having both hands engaged
with his cards, lost his balance and went over
backwards in a doubled-up condition, and per-
formed a sort of upside-down Belgian plunge into
three feet of water behind him, htill holding his
cards, and making a splash that washed the walls
and beams overhead.
Before he had got righted the captain himself
put his head through the skylight: “ Come on,
you fools, the tug’s alongside ! ”
The coast pilot had seen their very first rocket,
and was moored up against the steamer, and there
was a comfortable Christian gangway from one
vessel to the other. The four men waded through
the saloon, and, all soaked and dripping, came up
and followed the captain over it amid veiled and
unveiled pleasantries. One of the four turned
round to another as he went along, “ Why didn’t
vou make it hearts ? ”
