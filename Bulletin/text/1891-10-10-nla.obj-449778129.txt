DR, KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILD
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE ■ THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY PAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARE UNAWARE OF HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS:—
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH, HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC. AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY, THE VICTIM OP THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OF ALL VICKS, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND STIAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS TUB POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OP AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OF OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE,
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE FROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLAGE.
SEE HIS PALE AND SALLOW FACE, UPON WHICH
DISEASE LIAS LEFT ITS HANKS.

The Co-Operative
SYSTEM, the nearest approach to Socialism that can be achieved under the
present conditions of life, has met with phenomenal success wherever it has
been applied to any object. In England, even the Co-operative Societies
benefit some millions of persons—their membership exceeding a million and
a-half, and hold invested capital to the amount of eleven millions of money.
This success is owing to the fact that the investor sees not only a fair com-
mercial return on his investment, but a proprietary division of profits, which
he would not receive from any other organisation. It has been left to Aus-
tralia to apply this communistic principle to
Irrigation
and the CO-OPERATIVE IRRIGATION and MERCANTILE SOCIETY
of AUSTRALIA, Ltd., have already secured three irrigation colonies in
Victoria, which are partially settled and planted, and are negotiating for the
purchase of a tract of magnificent irrigation country in the West. Nego-
tiations are also pending for a Government concession of Murray land, and
there are now
Colonies
half-populated, awaiting the small Capitalist, the employed ARTISAN, or
the man whose sole CAPITAL is his LABOUR.

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1891.
"Do the Australians Hate England ?”
The more or less distinguished visitor who
drifts around for a brief period in Australia
and then bolts back to his native land, and
delivers lectures, or publishes his “impres-
sions,” is fast becoming a bye-word and a
gigantic laughing-stock. David Christie
Murray, the last addition to this great tribe,
has just gone the same way as the rest.
There is a sameness, like that of a literary
Sahara, among these travellers, who all
go back to bang discords on the one key-
note. The feeling of solemn disappointment
which pervades them is almost too deep for
words. The burden of their cry is that the
Australian is not English in his thoughts or
aspirations—that he has little respect for
British traditions or institutions— that he
has no pride in British history—that he looks
with cold, dull indifference on British ideals
in general—and that even the inestimable'
boon of Imperial Federation is, in his case,
only a pearl cast before swine. The whole
race of British travellers, right down to the
lamented barn-stormer who so recently
quitted these shores, are surprised and dis-
gusted by these things. They are utterly
unable to realise that ideals won’t bear tran
shipment, and that traditions can’t be for-
warded by cable. They have almost all
made up their minds that the Australian is
some variety of an Englishman, and starting
from this point they naturally conclude that
he is a very bad variety—which is much the
same as complaining of a horse because it is
a great failure when regarded as a cow.
Some day, possibly, a universal law Avill be
passed by which no man shall be permitted
to write a book about any country until after
ten years’ acquaintance with it, but until
some such statute is enacted, the case is evi-
dently hopeless.
# # *
Yet, strange to relate, tne majority of
“ distinguished visitors ” have returned
home to report that Australia is pro-
foundly loyal to Britain and the British
Crown. However, the last addition to
the tribe announces in the Contemporary
Review that Australia loathes Britain and
would gladly kick the British Grown, which
is a refreshing change from the old mono-
tonous war-whoop of the globe-trotters who
have gone before. But regarded as a histori-
cal statement it is almost as hopelessly and
utterly absurd as the other. Australia does
not love or adore or unanimously grovel to
Britain, nor does it hate that far-away island
which lies off the north-west coast of France,
or long to wipe it out, or desire to do any-
thing for it or against it. Its attitude is one
of cold, immoveable, cast-iron indifference.
But the very fact that any English-speaking
nation can be utterly indifferent to the exis-
tence of England is the one point that is
beyond the range of British comprehension.
Adoration and hatred are active national
emotions, and they both imply that this
country takes a deep and lasting interest in
the so-called fatherland, and as the fixed
idea of the Anglican globe - trotter is
that his fatherland is the hub of the
universe and that the whole human race
lias its eye riveted thereon, he 'can
understand either sentiment. But even if
three million tongues yell the fact into the
capacious ear of Britain that this Southern
race has no sentiments at all on the subject,
it would probably make the matter no
clearer. The English nation itself has no
animosity towards the North Pole or the
bottom of the Pacific ; it certainly doesn’t
go around cheering for them, but, despite
that fact, it has no active dislike for either
of them; and the feeling of Australia towards
its alleged parent is exactly the same. The
one fact which the ‘’distinguished visitor”
always forgets to gum into his hat, is that
Australia is just about as enthusiastic con-
cerning England as it is concerning the east
coast of Mexico, and for want of this text to
start from he inevitably goes astray.
* * #
It is part of the indictment levelled against
this new race that it has no ideals or historical
sympathies ; that it doesn’t thrill” at such
great names as those of Simon de Montfort
and a hundred other mighty patriots, or at
such great memories as those of Cressy,
Poictiers, Trafalgar and Waterloo. And the
statement is true, for the Australian doesn’t
thrill worth a cent. It is all a part of the
same, unspeakable indifference. Thrill is a
thing which can't be transplanted, and time
and distance are fatal to it. The English-
man himself, for that matter, has about
forgotten Simon de Montfort, and not one
in forty knows whether he was a patriot or
a racehorse. And with regard to the old
historic memories, the Briton doesn’t grow
excited to-day over the glorious fight
at Arbela, or the great struggle at Nico-
polis, or that last grand effort that was
made by a dying nation at Karkar,
simply because he was absent ; and he
drops all mention of the great battle of
Baylen out of his history of the Peninsular
war because he wasn’t there ; and the Aus-
tralian in like manner has no interest in
Cressy or Trafalgar because he wasn’t there
either. No nation ever did howl perman-
ently over an event in which it had no share.
The Australian when he grows a national
hero has as much capacity for frenzy as can
be expected. He has done his uttermost to
make a martial demi-god out of stout old
Peter Lalor ; he still goes looking at
intervals for Leichhardt who was lost in the
days of ancient history, and in his anxiety
to find a hero he will probably keep on look-
ing for him for another century or so ; and
he has put a halo round that unspeakable
blunderer, Robert O’Hara Burke. He has
spent so much devotion over these fifth-rate
deities that when he gets a real, first-class
divinity of his own his whoop will assuredly
shake the earth. But he doesn’t want to
borrow a hero, any more than the English-
man wants to borrow Confucius and Gari-
baldi, and keep holiday in honour of them.

When Imperial Federation fell dead some
few years ago the itinerant Briton struggled
hard to find out the reason why, that he
might go home and incorporate the fact in
his lectures or his big book. So far as Aus-
tralia was concerned he is still investigating
and getting no nearer a solution. Yet the
explanation was sufficiently obvious : Federa-
tion died from utter indifference. There was
no profit in it; so far as this continent was
concerned, in fact, it was plainly a distinct
loss. But the typical Englishman believed
—and still believes-—that Australia and the
other outlying states of the empire must
crave for a share and a place in the British
Parliament, and he was utterly unable to
realise that the British Parliament was of no
more interest to anyone outside of Britain
than the Servian Skuptschina. He believed
that the people of the Antipodes must long
to have a vested interest in the memories cf
Henry Y., of Drake, Wellington, Nelson,
Marlborough, and a hundred similar indi-
viduals, just as the inflated Copt may possibly
imagine that England is longing to federate
with him so as to be able to brag about the
Pharaohs, He had a certain article to sell
—namely, a political alliance, and he thought
fit to decorate and put frills upon the deal
by lectures on the doings of his dead and
buried ancestors. The proceeding was as
dismal in its ghastly absurdity as if, while
trading off a pound of tea, he had delivered
an impassioned address on the Battle of
Waterloo ; and he might as reasonably have
quoted Waterloo as a reason why,anybody
should buy the tea when he didn’t use that
article. Australia declined Federation sim-
ply because it didn’t use it, and the British
patriot still stands aghast with his unfinished
historical lecture in his hand, and tries un-
successfully to realise the meaning of the
situation. /
* * #
Yet Australia, as we have already pointed
out, does not hate Britain, as Mr. Christie
Murray so rashly assumes. Neither does it
collectively hate the British monarchy or the
British monarch. It regards the latter just
as the monarch herself regards Thomas
Jones, of Thursday Island; she doesn’t
cheer wildly for Jones, nor does she regard
him with an active and well-defined loathing,
fche simply doesn’t care one solitary straw
whether there is such a person or not so
long as he abstains from interfering with
her comfort, and the sentiment is mutual.
When the British illustrated paper or the
British cablegram fiend or the British lec-
turer or poet talks incessantly about
Victoria, he excites the same feeling of
temporary disgust that arises in the human
soul when the amateur reciter rises to
deliver, for the thousandth time, the dreary
story of the dreary infant who stood upon a
burning deck, and for the moment the auditor
would gladly kill Victoria and extirpate the
partially combusted infant. When neither
of them are obtrusively put forward he
utterly forgets their existence. The Aus-
tralian is a Republ'can as a matter of busi-
ness. He does not hate England any more
than he hates Panama or Timbuctoo, and
his fixed resolve to be free from outside
interference, and to have no share in
extraneous wars and extraneous politics, is a
sentiment that has no more connection with
England—so long as that country does not
resort to hostile proceedings—than it has
with Central Africa. If a respectable Briton
such as David Christie Murray declines
to share a bed in a hotel with a gentlemanly
Asiatic, it does not necessarily imply that he
abhors the Asiatic in question and is thirst-
ing for his blood ; it merely indicates that
he wants a bed of his own. And the two
cases are absolutely identical. Australia
does not desire to have any political connec-
tion with Britain for exactly the same reason
why Britain does not desire to have any
political connection with Peru. There is
nothing to be gained by it, and even if the
Peruvian threw in gratis the glorious
memories of Pizarro and Almagro it
would probably make no difference. It
makes no difference to us either.
* # *
Even the hazy dream of a great Federa-
tion of all the English-speaking races can
arouse no enthusiasm in this new continent,
and the Englishman wonders much thereat.
But then the latter individual’s enthusiasm
arises solely from his inability to realise the
situation. If the English-speakipg races are
ever united, the centre of power must go
along with the centre of population, and
then the United States will have the control-
ling influence in the new Commonwealth,
and Governor Hamilton K. Fiskb, of
Massachusetts, will be sent over to look after
the province of England, and to assent to
Bills and wear a cocked hat in London.
Britain drivels at intervals about this great
alleged Federation simply because it can’t
understand how, under any possible com-
bination of circumstances, it. can be anything
save the boss and supreme head of the
Anglo-Saxon League. When the fact pene-
trates its pachydermatous intelligence that
such a combination will reduce it to the rank
of a subordinate province it will drop the sub-
ject, for it doesn’t want Governor Hamilton
K. Fiske on any terms. He might be the
best and noblest of mankind, but England
would refuse a foreign apostle on such condi-
tions. Australia feels on the subject of
Fiske just as England does, and Kintore
or Jersey are only Fiske under another
designation—therefore it doesn’t want to
join any outside Federation whatsoever.
This is the sentiment which the British
literary globe-trotter has tried so often to
understand, and always without success,
because he never can and never will judge
any other nation by the same standard as he
judges himself. Possibly if he would picture
his own feelings on the arrival of the first
American Governor of England he might get
some glimmering of the real nature of the
situation.

Christie Murray assumes that the objec-
tions raised by Australia to promiscuous and
wholesale British immigration arise from the
Australian’s permanent and deep-rooted
hatred to England and all its works. The
conclusion is an idiotic one, and it is idioti-
cally arrived at. It might as reasonably be
assumed that if the litterateur himself objects
to a cow in his bedroom, therefore he loathes
the whole race of cows, calves, bulls, and
heifers, and hungers to reduce them all to
one ruined mass of horns and hoofs and hair
and dead meat. Australia objects to the
new and fresh Englishman chiefly because he
wants to run this country on English plans
and specifications, and for the sole honour
and glory of England. The political situa-
tion would be exactly the same if about
20,000,000 Frenchmen settled in England
and wanted to run England purely for the
glory and profit of France. Even if there
was abundant elbow-room for them all, the
patriotic Briton would doubtless object voci-
ferously ; but, unluckily, he seems utterly
unable to comprehend why anybody should
object, save himself. He argues exclusively
upon the theory that because there is an
abundance of empty space in Australia there-
fore the English immigrant must be wanted to
fill that space. But as it happens space and
emptiness are merely relative terms Aus-
tralia is empty comnared with England ;
England is also empty c< mpared with the
provinces of eastern China ; and the reason
why Australia should welcome the British
immigrant irrespective of numbers is exactly
the same reason why Britain should take in
some 20,000,000 Chinamen, and feel glad to
see them come. Yet if the Briton will look
at the matter carefully he will find that he
isn’t pining for 20,000,000 or any less
number of Chinamen, despite the com-
parative emptiness of his country, and when
he has fully analysed this emotion he may
possibly understand why the Australian
doesn’t pine after the imported English-
man, despite the emptiness - likewise
comparative —of his country ul.o The
_ -»
position in both cases is sufficiently simple
and if the globe-trotter understands the one
problem, yet can’t realise the other, it can
only be because his Creator didn’t furnish
him with comprehension, and no one else
can supply the deficiency. So far, he has
shown no signs of understanding iu the
matter When the hospitable Australian
took him in and entertained him, he set it
down to .profound and undying loyalty to
England, just as Cetbwayo, when he was
made a temporary lion in London, might
have set that down to England’s love and
abject reverence for his far-off Zululand.
And when, as iu the case of Christie
Murray, this country guyed his execrable
show, that was set down to a national hatred
that nothing could ever quench or alleviate.
And yet in reality there is neither love nor
hatred in the case —only profound indiffer-
ence.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Blessing's in Disguise.
A writer in London Referee repeats the
Bulletin’s old argument that an exceptionally
insane or blackguardly peer is a noble blessing
in disguise, and says of the impecunious young
Ailesbury :—
, I[e is probably doing more service to his country than
nine-tenths of his fellow-peers. Who knows what national
benefit may not come of his peculiar reading of the
proverb Noblesse oblige ? He is bringing into disrepute
{more disrepute—En. B.) the principle of hereditary
nobility and primogeniture, two of our national institu-
tions which, dating from the dark ages, seem destined
sooner or later, to be swept away in the tide of national
progress. . . . The evils of privilege are considerably
modified by our system of constantly refreshing the
Upper Chamber by infusions of plebeian blood (mostly
brewers, by the way), and, failing the revelation of some
glaring wrong, the English people are hard to move in
the direction of reform. But it does seem odd that, while
the Jockey Club may purify Newmarket of the Marquis
of Ailksbury’s presence, no means should exist whereby
this hereditary legislator can be warned off the benches
of the House of Lords.
The Referee man doesn’t stick to his text,
though. Theoretically, the foul-mouthed hus-
band of Dolly Tester is as well entitled to sit
on those benches as his respectable brother-
Marquis of Salisbury, the type of man who so
“ fills the position ” he was born into as to
almost hide the fact that said position is
founded on hereditary wrong and covered with
a moss of abuses. Noblesse oblige is, indeed, the
falsest of proverbs, implying that ruling fami-
lies are estimable institutions as long as they
are represented by decent individuals. Yet a
bad old Tory principle is equally bad whether
illustrated by a sober Cecil or a boozy Brude-
nell-Bruce. The one treats his subject in a
glamourous, dignified style, the other gives us
a hideous caricature, and it is the caricature
which disgusts the vulgar eye and sets the
masses thinking. People become suddenly
aware that the marquis doesn’t make the man.
A little mental effort lands them at the con-
clusion that the man doesn’t make the marquis.
He is a creature of scandalous circumstances,
for which he is no more to blame than a rabbit
is to blame for being a devouring calamity. If
any marquis desired to make over his estates
tor the benefit of mankind the law of the land
would step in and stop him with an in-
junction, even as it has recently pro-
hibited Ailesbury from yielding up his
countless acres of Savernake to Sam Lewis, the
money lender. What has Ailesbury’s indi-
vidual folly and profligacy to do with his claim
to sit in the House of Peers, where a seat was
guaranteed to the young idiot by an idiotic
constitution before he was born ? Nothing. The
British nation took its chance of Ailesbury,
just as it took its chance of Tummy, whose
“right” to the Throne is not a question of
whether he carries baccarat-counters or a Bible
in his coat-pocket. Republicanism doesn’t
object to the Monarchy or the House of Peers
on purely personal grounds, although it is neces-
sary to make the best use of personal objects of
ridicule against those institutions and their
like. The real grievance is that toilers are
taxed, directly and indirectly, anil manhood is
in a hundred ways degraded in order that social
and political supremacy may bd assured to
two classes of money-spenders, whose education
almost invariably warps their virtues, when
they have any to start with, and quite invari-
ably brings their worst vices to a full maturity.
Harper on Intelligence.
In the Victorian Assembly the other night
Harper, M.L.A., the illustrious pepper-
grinder, rose like a thick stone wall to
block Premier Munro’s “One Man One
Vote ” Bill, and rashly stated his reasons for
so doing. When the modern Conservative gives
his reasons he is generally a lost bigot, and
Harper went the way of all the rest—yet his
case was the best one that was advanced on the
Tory side all through the debate. ■“ Men should
not have equal powers at elections,” he said,
“because some are much more capable than
others.” The Bulletin cordially concurs
in this statement, but has to remark
that Harper left the observation unfinished,
and an unfinished observation is of little service
to anybody. The Bulletin, like Harper,
would willingly give two, or even twelve, votes
to the man with brains if it could define that
man, and only one vote or no vote at all
to the man without brains, if it could define
that man also ; but as both men are generally
undefinable, the scheme is impossible. And,
strangely enough, Harper offered no sug-
gestion as to how the brainy man was to
be discovered and to get his extra votes.
His own idea evidently was that he should go
round in person, and differentiate the man of
large capacity from the other man with no
capacity at all, but in that case he would
assuredly put himself at the head of the list,
which would be sufficient evidence that the
examiner of intelligence had none himself.
The simplest wav, no doubt, would be for
each voter to slate candidly whether he
was supplied with intellect or not, but
then, who could swear that the returns
were reliable, and where is the voter who would
say he hadn’t an intellect ? Another method


would be for each man to decide on the brains
of the man next door, in which case Harper
would doubtless report that the common fellow
who repaired the road in front of his mansion
had only enough capacity for one vote, and
that son of toil would quite as probably return
a verdict that Harper himself was an unspeak-
able ass who couldn’t be trusted with any vote
at all. If Ibis system would be satisfactory to
Harper he ought to have mentioned the fact,
rphere would be nothing to be gained by
measuring the head of each voter in order to
arrive at an idea of the size of his thinking
organ, for the man with the small head might
have brain inside, and the man with the large
one might have only water and a tumour ; and
it is impossible to judge anybody’s mental
capacity by his property, for he might have
got it in the same way as he got his large feet
and his short legs —by inheritance, in which case
he might as well get an extra vote for
the short legs as for the property. Moreover,
he might have stolen the property, and in that
case he would have an extra vote for his
dishonesty, which is a depressing considera-
tion, and one which might lead to garrotting
and pocket-picking. Therefore, to all appear-
ance, the project is unworkable. If it could be
managed The Bulletin would be glad, for
then George Higinbotham would have at
least 48 times as many votes as Harper, which
would be a fair and reasonable average ; but
unhappily there is no way of arriving at it, and
the only alternative is to give every man one
vote, and thus strike the best average that the
case will admit. It is better that a great and
comprehensive fool should have one vote than
twenty, anyhow.

In Bathurst (N.S.W.) the price of gas—manu-
factured in the corporation gas-works —has
just been reduced to 3s. per 1000 feet. In
Sydney, where the gas-supply is in the hands
of a big private company, the price is ss. 3d.
Yet the gas-accounts at Bathurst show a profit,
from which, we presume, that the Sydney
monopoly could supply gas at 3s. 6d. or so, if it
felt that way inclined, and show a profit also.
But it is the chief disadvantage of the average
monopoly that it never does feel that way
inclined, and it is more likely to raise the price
of its faded yellow glimmer than to reduce it.
Therefore, when gas is a dead and gone illumi-
nation, and electricity has taken its place, the
people of Sydney (who are just now being
asked to sanction a private Electric Light-
ing Bill) should make sure that the light-
ing business is retained under municipal
control then and for ever afterwards. Mel-
bourne suffers even more seriously from its gas-
syndicate, but the soulful corporation in the
Victorian capital seems to regret that it is a
monopoly, and it wants badly to sell out to the
ratepayers, and points out incessantly that the
city ought to retain the profits of the in-
dustry in its own hands. It has felt this way
ever since the electric-light began to run it out
of the field a year or two ago, and in the full-
ness of its heart it has done its utmost ever
since then to trade off its goodwill and its
ancient plant for about three times what they
were worth when new. The deal has nearly
come off more than once, but every time some-
thing prevented it, and the company’s offer has
thus been a blocked generosity. It feels badly
hurt over this, too ; there is something almost
tearful in the way it implores the city‘to come
in and share the profits, and even when the
city rejects the offer in a brutal, unfeeling
manner, it always comes back and starts the
subject over again at next municipal meeting.

Sydney D.T. is hysterical on the subject of
“Victoria, the Free Pass Happy Land.” But is
Hot New South Wales infected body and soul
with the “ deadhead ” disease? In Victoria the
evil is exposed by a Parliamentary committee,
but in New South Wales a demand for an inquiry
is bumptiously converted into a motion of cen-
sure. The “free-pass” section of the com-
munity would constitute a little army in New
South Wales. Not content with their £3OO a
year, and free carriage in the State trains,
members of Parliament ask for and receive free
passes for their wives and families and servants.
Even Ministers of the Crown arc commonly
known to take advantage of their Ministerial
positions to give a free ride to a relative or in-
fluential constituent. No traveller can be blind
to the rascally doings of certain politicians.
The usual practice is for a Minister or a
meraber-out-of-office to “engage” a car, and
take in his wife and children, with perhaps a
few friends. A Minister has been known to
put off a journey because the necessary “free
passes ” had not been forwarded for his wife,
family and servants. The “ dead-head ” system
must cost an enormous sum every year. But
no reform will ever take place while a majority
of the Assembly grovel to the Commissioners.
It pays a married politician to uphold the
“ free-pass ” institution. We have just heard of
a rich New South Wales official who, for purely
ornamental duties, is paid £BOO a year, and
whose place could be easily supplied at less
than £3OO a year—yet he is given the use of
a Government steam-launch and crew to convey
his female relations and their luggage to 1m sea-
side residence ! Free passes indeed !
A country which allows lawyers to make it®
laws is a fool of a country. In Australia the
law is mostly made by lawyers, and con-
sequently it is hardly possible to understand
any Act without hiring a solicitor to explain it,
or to do anything under the provisions of any
Act without hiring a lawyer, and getting
counsel’s opinion. Every year, too, a dozen
new laws are passed, requiring the nation to
1 .re still more lawyers, and it is hardly possible
to do anything without filing a document, or
swearing an affidavit, or lodging a caveat,
or a demurrer, or something, at great
expense. In Norway every town or village has
its board of conciliation elected by the in-
habitants. Everybody who wants to go to law
has to bring his case before this board, and the
plaintiff and the defendant are both required to
dump down the sum of for expenses. The
board isn’t absolutely ravenous about the
however; it gets it whenever it can, but if
either party hasn’t the money it is bound to go
°n with the case just the same. No lawyers
are allowed to appear before the court unless
one of the parties to the case is a foreigner
residing outside the country—an event which
hardly ever happens; the plaintiff or defendant
must turn up in person, or hy deputy, and the
deputy may he any sort of individual under the
sun, except a lawyer. If the defendant refuses
to appear, or if either party refuses to accept
the decision, then the case goes to law; the
board of conciliation has no power to enforce its
decision beyond this—the individual who de-
clines to submit his case to it, or to accept its
award, has to pay all the costs of the subsequent
proceedings whether he wins or loses. When
the board settles a case it charges the losing
party a further sum of So that the entire
cost of the biggest lawsuit is 2s. 7|d. The
boards decide 88 per cent, of the Norwegian
litigation, and the lawyers get the remaining
12 per cent. only. In almost all business con-
tracts a clause is now inserted that in case of
any dispute the decision of the board shall be
final, so that the percentage of actual litigation
is still diminishing. The courts sit once a week
in towns, and once every fortnight or every
month in country districts ; and as no case can
be adjourned more than once, nobody ever waits
more than two months at the outside for a
decision. This is the sort of law which
Australia wants badly.
The Victorian Upper House tackled the
Federation Bill, the other night, and abolished
that obnoxious and revolutionary term, the
“Commonwealth” (which is Saxon), on the
ground that it wasn’t good “English.” Then
it inserted the term “Dominion” (which is
Latin) on the ground that it teas good English !
and went on its way rejoicing. Probably the
Upper House hadn’t a dictionary Within reach,
or else it had one and looked for “ Common-
wealth ” under “ K. ” Both the terms are now
passably good English, but the former has
the additional advantage of being good Austra-
lian as well. But “Commonwealth” signifies
in the largest sense, government by the people ;
it has a smothered aspect of socialism, republi-
canism, and land nationalisation about it; while
“Dominion” is a good word to grovel about,
for it seems to imply that the country is
the personal property of a monarch, and the
average Legislative councillor loves to talk in
unctuous tones about his beloved sovereign and
her dominions. It is impossible to yell for a
beloved monarch and her commonwealth ; and
so the fatted orator at a banquet would be left.
He has a very limited repertoire, has that
maudlin fat party who rises and totters on his
fiat feet at the Queen’s Birthday feed, and if
the “dominions” were struck out he would
have no repertoire at all. No one can imagine
a huge red person hollering for a commonwealth
in any case ; somehow, it is always the thin
man with only one chin who wants a common-
wealth, and the vast individual with grease
and wine on his whiskers wants a dominion.
Nobody knows exactly why this is, but the
fact is indisputable. If you weigh twenty
typical loyalists and twenty average repub-
licans, there is at least one and a-half tons
difference in the total—sometimes more.
The organ of which Henry George lately
resigned the editorship demands to know (in
the interests of Freetrade and unlimited Free
Competition) why America does not take the
Russian Hebrew in—5,000,000 of him—and
treat him as a brother? The two following
pictures of human inhumanity are the gist of
the argument: —
A number of Hebrew immigrants from Russia arriving
in the ports of New York and Boston have been refused
permission to land because of their poverty. Was there
ever a more cruel exhibition of “ man’s inhumanity to
man ?” The whole civilised world is shocked and horrified
by the brutal banishment of these people from their
homes by Russia’s ruthless and abhorrent Czar. Nowhere
is this feeling more general than in the United States ;
but when a few of the persecuted wanderers reach our
shores we practically say to them : “ Go back to death at
the hands of the tyrant or fling yourselves into the sea,
for here, in ‘ the home of the brave and the land of the
free,’ there is no room for such as you.”
Years ago the writer saw a little boy, whose hands had
been mangled by a railway-train, run through the streets
with fingers hanging by a shred from his bleeding hands.
He undertook to enter a humble home, perhaps his own,
when a stalwart woman literally slammed the door in his
face, knocking him down, possibly to save her carpets
The writer had forgotten the incident until this parallel
act of cruelty by a great nation recalled it to his mind.
Exactly so. And now we want to know if
George’s literary successor took that boy in
and let him bleed over his carpets, or did be
leave bim out on the pavement, and go away to
make a paragraph out of the incident, and sell
the par. for cash to a newspaper. Also,
we would like to know if he has taken in even
one foul, evil-smelling, tattered Russian Hebrew
and let him roost in the Standard office, or is
he only cursing other people, in both cases, for
leaving undone what lie hasn’t done himself.
Sjuch philanthropy and such freetrade are both
exceedingly cheap. If the United States takes
in the whole gang of battered, penniless Israel-
ites there isn’t one of them who will run a news-
paper—in the English language at all events—
and thus damage George’s business, and he
nobly doesn’t care a hang though they damage
everybody else’s business. He wants the whole
5,000,000 to walk right in and make a mess on
somebody else’s carpet. And that is the I rec-
trader all over.

Sydney D.T. complains
The gratitude of Turkey is not retrospective in its view.
It lies mainly in the direction of favours to come. It is
nothing to her that England has fought her battles and
filled her empty coffers time after time at the cost of
English investors impoverished by her dishonored bonds,
and she yields but languid acquiescence to the fact that
but for the lavish expenditure of British blood and
treasure the Czar would have reigned in Constantinople
generations ago.
The amount of ignorance and astonishing
stupidity that is compressed into that one short
paragraph is amazing. What in the name of
all that is astounding does Turkey owe any
gratitude for ? In the reign of Mahmoud, Eng-
land, France and Russia swooped down on her
in a time of alleged friendship and alliance,
and without even declaring war they destroyed
her fleet at Navarino ; and then England
backed out and left her so crippled by this
disaster that she fell an easy prey to the
Czar. In 1854 England and France stood
by until Omar Pasha had utterly de-
feated the Russians by his own efforts, and
refused to move a gun or a man until the last
Muscovite had been driven headlong out of
Turkey; and then, when the victorious Moslems
had a prospect of peace and tranquillity, they
were forced by their two useless allies to waste
their men and money in the useless invasion or
the Crimea. In the next war bn gland saa cd
Constantinople, and calmly took Cyprus in
payment, and Turkey could have purchased
the support of alftiost any of the Great Powers
at the same price. She simply bought England s
assistance at a most exorbitant rate, because
the Sultan had no time to haggle over terms.
Since then, England has stolen Egypt 111
a time of profound peace, and another great
hunk of the Moslbm states has thus vanished.
In between these events, British financiers
have lent money to the Porte at nearly 40 pci
cent. interest, discount, and other steals
all included—and have thus ruined her over
again, and finally England threatens to grab
Mitylene —also in a time of peace. lurthei,
she engaged to prevent Russia building a Black
Sea fleet and broke her word; she engaged
again to keep thfe Czar’s fleet out of the Medi-
terranean and broke that treaty also, aim she
broke every other treaty she ever made at Con-
stantinople. And, therefore, Turkey longs to
meet England some day or other in perdition,
and there howl curses and heave molten fire at
her for 20,000,000 centuries for her treachery
and lying, and the Moslems are not grateful
not much.

The Canadian Premier has found himself obliged
to bring forward a measure which purports to
deal a death-blow to bribery ; but it may fairly
be maintained that any Bill making penal both
the offering and the acceptance of bribes will
defeat its own ends. The only certain means
of checking bribery would be the introduction
of a measure abolishing all penalties for offering
bribes, while providing for the condign punish-
ment of those accepting the same. It is an open
secret that in one of the Australias, a few years
since, a Minister of the Crown was guilty of
gross corruption in straining his power for the
purpose of blackmailing individuals; and the
evil result of this Minister’s conduct is still
felt in the province, although his portfolio
is now in the hands of a man of unblemished
reputation. Had the means for checking
bribery been in force there can be no doubt that
this blackmailing, which is supposed to have
aggregated at least £30,000, would have been
impossible, in addition to which the public
interests would have been far better served,
and the man on whose recommendation this
undoubtedly astute individual received his ap-
pointment would have been spared considerable
odium. In N. S. Wales the absurdity of the
law as it now stands has been shown by the
action some time back of Premier Parkes in
prosecuting an unfortunate individual who had
the impertinence to offer him a trifling sum with
a view to obtaining a small Government ap-
pointment, while it is certain that no protection
from blackmailing such as mentioned above is
provided. What both Australia and Canada
really require is such an alteration in their
statutes as will make it no longer equally neces-
sary for those offering bribes to keep silent, as
it is for those accepting the same.
Dear Bulletin —Except for the discredit of
the thing—for what professional journalist who
honoured his calling could enter into a competi-
tion on such degrading terms ? I would
contribute a yarn to the “ Christmas Story
Competition ” of a certain paper, on the
off-chance of winning, not the prize, but a
place among the number of rejected stories
worthy of publication. And what would Ido
upon the publication of my yarn ? Eire a bill
into the proprietary for payment at ordinary
rates ! The smart Editor and his smarter eo-
proprietor have been just a little too clever this
time. One of the conditions of the competitions
confers upon the Editor the right to publish
any story not taking the prize. To have
appended to this clause the words “ without
payment ” would have given the game
straight away (it is to be presumed that
the paper is playing the office’s old
game) "and, accordingly, the words were left
out. But the omission, as I am legally
advised, will not remove the obligation to
pay for all competing stories inserted. I
have withheld this bit of information till the
“competition” has virtually closed, so that no
amendment of the condition can be made ; and
I am prepared to back my solicitor s judgment
in the matter to the extent of a two-guinea
subscription to have the point tested in court,
should the paper carry out its editor s implied
threat of publishing a selection from the non-
prize-winning manuscripts. Something will
have to be done to discourage the continuance
in connection witli the Australian press of a
method of procuring original matter which
would bring a blush to the unwashed cheek of a
Seven Dials publisher. Even Jemmy Gatnach
paid for the screed he printed.—A Hireling
Scribe.
While the New South Wales Government
reforming banking legislation it will be well if
it arranges that the banks where Government
loan funds are lodged are on a thoroughly
sound basis. As things at present stand, the
bank auditors never even see the branch
accounts or securities, and even the securities
at the head-office are merely passed as stated,
and no idea of their value is ever attempted to
be obtained by auditors. The issue of notes
uncontrolled by Government is another bad
point, for supposing that the general manager
of a bank having 50 branches wishes to put a
good face on the balance sheet, he can easily
send to each branch 10,000 new, unsigned notes.
These stand in the books of the branch as cash,
but pay no duty and are not advised to head
office as issued until actually signed and paid
out. The funds in hand thus appear to be half
a million in excess of actual fact. The only
absolute remedy is to make the issue of
notes a State monopoly, but till this is
done all notes should be obtained by the
banks through Government, duly stamped with
the amount of duty for one year, which should
be paid by the banks on receipt of the notes,
and these should be liable to duty until with-
drawn from circulation when cancelled by
Government, which could then recover the amount
if any, or make a refund should they be with-
drawn before the expiry of the time on which
duty had been paid. Thus there would be
established a system of control preventing the
issue or use of notes in excess of the amount
legally authorised. And it should be made a
felony for any director or general manager to
authorise or obtain from the bank with which
he is connected any pecuniary advance what-
ever.
Baron Carington will now be able to perceive
what history will think of his connection with
the shameful Mount Rennie affair. Already
there are to be found, in a half-house, 13 mem-
bers of the N.S. Wales Legislative Assembly
who, on account of his share in that dark and
savage deed, resist the naming after him of a
city electoral division; when the generation
which licked his lordly boots shall have passed
away and lie is remembered only as the
man who sent four boys to their death
after a trial which was a farce, his name
will be execrated for all time throughout
the Australian Republic. His measure of igno-
miny is shared not only by all those who had a
direct hand in the unspeakable blasphemy
against justice and civilisation which culminated
on the 4th January, 1887, but also by the daily
press and by every citizen of Australia who,
knowing the revolting circumstances of the so-
called trial, failed to protest against this bloody
perversion of every principle of ‘ ‘ British Jus-
tice.” —
“ Whatever the facilities afforded to prisoners on their
trial may be, they can be of little avail when the sittings
of the Court are protracted from day to day to such an
extreme as to exhaust the physical and mental energies
of counsel and jurymen alike. No case has been heard
of in modern times in which English Judges have com-
pelled jurors and counsel in criminal cases involving
issues of life and death to sit all through the night in
spite of repeated protests and requests for adjourn-
ment.”
So said the cowardly S.M. Herald in a leading
article—but not until the very hour on which
the condemned stood upon the scaffold. “For
such a trial as this,” exclaimed W. B. Halley,
(vide S.M. Herald report of deputation to Gover-
nor Carington) “ one looks in vain even to the
darkest and bloodiest periods of Irish history. '
The Bulletin trusts that the Mount Rennie
affair will again come before Parliament in the
form of a motion for the release of the sur-
viving convicts. Law may keep them in gaol.
Justice cannot do so. They have never yet been
tried.
One Man, One Vote.
“The D.” writes us thus; —Dear Bulletin,—
The One-man-one-vote problem appears to be too
steep an equation for N.S.W. parliamentarians*
Simple and finite as are its terms, members will
persist in regarding it as of the indeterminate
order, only to be solved by the application of the
process of “continued fractions.” This confusion
apparently arises from the ever-changing condi-
tions of population in the various areas of a young
and progressive nation. One nostrum is the
division of the province into electorates, each
returning a single member. Tins would be seem-
ingly fair if district populations always remained
stationary. Notoriously, they do not, however,
and this circumstance would necessitate a redis-
tribution of electorates at least every three years,
if not oftener. The parliamentary manipulation
of such a periodical task would mean artful divi-
sion of the most party kind, and under which the
uppermost dog would maintain and increase pre-
sent advantages. An escape from such a tyranny
has been suggested by the appointment of a non-
political Board which shall, without reference to
Parliament or the Ministry, periodically re-divide
the country into the required number of elec-
torates. This sounds plausible enough, but when-
ever was there a Ministerially-appointed Board
that had no political bias, or that was not squeez-
able? Never. Another hon. member has—or,
rather, several hon. members have—been illogical
enough to contend that country districts require
a greater proportion of representation than do
metropolitan electorates. This proposal would
simply split into posts-and-rails the solid log of
One-man-one-vote, and it may be contemptuously
dismissed. The one scheme that presents a per-
fect theory of equal representation on the basis of
One-man-one-vote —or, as it might then be styled,
Each-man-equal-voting-power—is to convert New
South Wales into one huge single electorate, and
place within the power of every elector the right
to vote for as many candidates as there are
representatives in Parliament. The politicians,
of course, will howl down any such proposal.
Candidates would then have practically to canvass
the whole colony—if not by actually stumping it,
at least, by plenitude of advertisements and
by filling the land with printed addresses.
Minister Garruthebs, for instance, already snorts
because the area of the Sturt electorate covers
45,000 square miles, and gives a daisy job to can-
vassers. But which are the interests to be mainly
considered in an electioneering maelstrom—those
of the candidates, or those of the electors?
Undoubtedly, the latter. The Legislative
Assembly lias already lightened the woes of can-
didates by abolishing the £4O deposit hitherto
required to be put up as a preliminary guarantee
against a frivolous and unwarranted contest, and
it° might not be a hurtful precaution to hedge
against prolific would-be’s by a counter call of the
kind indicated; although it is possible, if not
probable, that the Legislative Council will
endeavour to re-impose the deposit risk. If, how-
ever, it is not considered desirable to load candi-
dates with adverse contingencies, but it is wished
to give every self-inspired aspirant a full and easy
chance of getting into the legislature, might not
the democracy go further still than the Assembly
has yet essayed ? Might not the whole cost of all
elections be saddled on the State, within
well-defined limits of allowable expenditure?
Might not the Government Gazette be
the medium through which the election addresses
of the several hundreds of candidates shall be
distributed among the electors? For, with no
deposit required, and no election expenses to pro-
vide for, there would probably be ten times as
many candidates as possible members ! Forsaking
the sarcastic mood of the last two sentences, it
may be reiterated that the One-electorate system
is the only perfect theory under which absolute
equality of manhood suffrage can ever be obtained
—a theory, too, which, if memory serves aright,
The Bulletin has favorably recommended in the
past. Whether the adoption of this system would
or would not lead to an organisation of prelimi-
nary caucus-pollings, and whether such caucus-
work would be healthy or otherwise for the body
politic, open up too many considerations for
adequate treatment here.

“Independence: A Retrospect.”*
The above is the style and designation of a
pamphlet lately published in London by one
Charles Bland, and purporting to be a
history of the sudden rise and the great
appalling fall of the Australian Republic. The
writer, like Bellamy, is looking backward—
looking with sad regret down the long avenue
of years where lie the ashes and the time-
blasted wreckage of a nation that began its
career without brains or patriotism, and ended
it after the manner of a broken-down shearers’
strike. The writer’s diction is woefully loose,
and his story is feebly strung together, but the
great axiom of his faith is at least unmistake-
able, and that axiom is that Australia is utterly
dependent on England for money, brains, and
political morality, and, therefore, with the
severing of the “silken bonds,” the new
republic slides down with a yell and a curse
into the abyss. From first to last it makes no
attempt to struggle against fate, and the one
bright spot in the story is where the miserable,
toothless commonwealth goes back—crippled,
and in a wheelbarrow—to its allegiance, and
howls outside the door of its political parent
asking to be taken in. It is taken in accordingly
—and the proceedings end with repentance,
tears, and “ God .Save the Queen.” The picture
of the prodigal commonwealth moaning at its
mother’s keyhole amid the frozen blast of a cold
winter of discontent is touchingly drawn.
# # •
Mr. Bland is not, in any sense, original, save
in his unfathomable dullness. His book is
heavier than a lead-mine filled with water,
duller than a toothless aboriginal, and less in-
telligent than a pig’s infant. Even his nomen-
clature is of the bald and hairless variety. The
people of ‘ ‘ Albert-land ” —wherever that may
be—start the great movement by refusing to
receive Sir Henry Thorndyke as- Governor—
an incident which is obviously a slavish copy of
that other famous trouble when Sir Thomas
MTl wraith put his veto upon Policeman
Blake, and abolished that incipient official in
one act. They do this for no possible reason
save larrikinism and cussedness, for all their
relations are peaceful, and the new Governor is
a noble individual—so noble that even to carry
his washing would be in itself a liberal educa-
tion. Then the Australian republic starts
business in such a way as no republic ever
started before. It has no central authority—
no capital—no Federal Parliament—and the six
individual States positively refuse to agree
about anything. Even Liberia, Peru, and the
negro commonwealth of San Domingo knew
better than this, but Australia doesn’t know
better, because the instant it loses the assist-
ance and protection of England it ceases to
know anything. How any other State, which
hasn’t the assistance of England, knows any-
thing either, isn’t explained ; in fact this parti-
cular author explains nothing at all. He men-
tions, however, that after the separation was
accomplished Greek was very little known in
Australia, and that there was no longer at
Government House any “ Lady Violet or Lady
Gwendolen for our girls to imitate in voice
and manner,” and this circumstance seems to
lie heavily on his chest. How nine-tenths of the
world gets on without any Lady Violet, or how
no country, save England, can grow the afore-
said Gwendolen, or why the local girl shouldn’t
struggle through with her own voice, are three
more of the unanswered problems of the story.
# # *
Then the new republic cruises aimlessly
around for a year or two on a sunless sea of
drivel and incapacity. Every other new state
lias grown some great man at the crisis when
its career was just beginning -even San Domingo
produced the mighty Toussatnt L’Ouverture,
and the worn and feeble nations of South
America raised a dozen doughty men, from
Bolivar to Balmaceda ; but the Australian
Commonwealth doesn't grow so much as a
decent parish beadle. When the silken bonds
are severed, the united intellect of the country
turns to road-metal. The whole nation goes
bankrupt almost on the instant, to start with,
because the supply of English loans ran out,
from which fact a great moral is to be deduced,
and that moral is that no nation can exist if
England doesn’t lend it money. How any part
of the world existed at all until some *2OO
years ago, when national debts were first
invented, or how it is that England exists,
seeing that she isn’t borrowing money,
arc two more problems which remain unan-
swered. Anyhow, Australia bursts because it
can't get into debt, and at this crisis Ecuador
rises and commits a brutal outrage on this
country, and this country can do nothing but
submit. It lias to knock under abjectly be-
cause it is no longer joined on to England, and
yet Ecuador isn’t joined on to England either,
and it doesn’t knock under, which is inexplic-
able. Why Ecuador doesn’t go and outrage all
t he other countries that don’t belong to Britain
is another unsettled consideration, and the
question why the North Pole doesn’t commit a
brutal wrong against the bottom of the Atlantic
comes into the same category. As Ecuador
just now has only an army of 1600 men, and
lias no navy at all, and as it is dead-broke, and
t he entire white population is only 100,000, in-
cluding infants and people of deficient intellect,
the natural proceeding would be to crowd the
police force and the Permanent Artillery into
t he Rotomahana, and knock the republic into
slivers, but this -would spoil the story. A
hideous outrage perpetrated by Goat Island
upon the rest of this mighty continent would
have filled the bill just as well.
< * # *
Finally, war breaks out between Britain and
France, and the Australian republic dies miser-
ably. The French cruisers capture the British
mail-boats, &c., on the coast, and this finishes
the abject and imaginary commonwealth. Of
course they would have captured these vessels
just the same if Australia had still belonged to
the Empire, and would probably have burnt
Melbourne and Sydney as well, but the writer
forgets this. In his plain and simple pig-headed-
netis even such an obvious fact as that never
dawns on him. Australia suffers no damage in
the war, but it goes bung because it can’t get
its wool exported, or its gold, or its corn, or
anything else ; ami therefore men give up
raising wool, or mining for gold, or growing
vegetables, and relapse into a state of nature.
In real life, of course, trade would go on just as
before, and American, German, Spanish,
Italian, and other vessels would take up the
business, but the writer of “Independence”
evidently doesn’t know that any country has
ships save England, Also, if Australia—a
purely neutral state—is thus ruined by a war
between two outside parties, it naturally
follows that every other neutral state must be
affected the same way, and all the world must
go to utter, unspeakable smash from exactly
the same causes, but the incredible mule
who perpetrates the book never notices this
tremendous discrepancy. It is at this stage of
the proceedings that the Commonwealth gees
round miserably on all-fours to the back-door
and implores its once-despised mother to take
it in and hide it in a safe place under the wash-
board, and it is taken in accordingly. Presum-
ably, under these circumstances, France goes
on seizing the mail-steamers as before, and,
Australia being now an enemy’s-country, bom-
bards Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and
Adelaide as well—at least, that is what would
assuredly happen in real history—but this
obvious circumstance is judiciously shirked.
The story ends with the landing of the
new Governor—in the depth of its repentance
Australia implores the people at “Home” to
send out the same individual whom it formerly
rejected—and “God Save the Queen” generally,
and the whole nation is wallowing on ail fours.
* * *
“ Independence ” is, in its way, the most hope-
lessly dull, inconsequent book that ever
appeared in print. The writer is a tenth-rate
copyist—a dreary, childish groveller without
sense, logic, or knowledge of mankind. His
republic falls owing to a series of causes which
would make any real and genuine State rise and
prosper ; in fact, he doesn’t know a cause when
he sees it, and having resolved to make the
Commonwealth die he doesn’t know how to kill
it. His diction is as solemn as the ashes of a
dead world ; he hauls his tale in clumsily by
the hair, and hauls it out again in the last
chapter the same way ; he is pompous, dicta-
torial, and hopelessly uninteresting, and he has
a dreary way of holding up his dead facts for
inspection on the end of his literary pitchfork
which is unspeakably irritating. But still his
book has one great recommendation ; as a handy
publication to buy and give to an enemy, it is
unrivalled. Unnecessary to state, it has been
largely eulogised by the Australian daily press,
the owners and conductors whereof were mostly
suckled on such unspeakable bosh in Hingland.
*“ Independence ; a Retrospect,” by Charles Ash-
wold Bland; published by Harrison and Sons, London,
More “National Association.”
Within the last few weeks N.S. Wales has started
a “National Association,” and in proof of its
strictly national character a large gang of in-
fluential capitalists have already joined, and more
are joining. Nobody, in fact, who is not a mer-
chant, or a banker, or a big landholder, or the
owner of a large amount of cash carefully in-
vested, has anything to do with the association.
There is nobody in it who wants the abolition of
plural voting, for the members all have plural
votes —whole stacks of them. There is nobody
who wants land-nationalisation, for they all own
land or have mortgages over it. The National
Association doesn’t personally care about free
education, for it is in a position to pay for
all the education it wants; nor does it
care about a system of universal State
insurance, because it has no immediate [ rospect
of being hard-up in its old age. It is for
these reasons that it is called a “National ” Asso-
ciation. The associates are mostly Foreign-
traders and believers in cheap Chinese, nigger,
and European labour, for all these tilings bring
down wages, and most of them pay wages instead
of receiving them ; and they are decidedly
“loyal,” because some of them have the run of
Government House, and the rest want to have it.
Their programme is borrowed verbatim from that
of the Victorian “National” Association, and
consists of eight articles, of which 50 per cent, are
hypocrisy, and the other 50 are liogwash. The
first of these eight purposes is “ to preserve the
national character of the Legislature, ” and to pre-
vent members being the “delegates of any section
of society,” which obviously means that the mem-
bers are to be all lawyers, merchants, and land-
lords as heretofore, and that the Association
will raise Sheol when Labour, which represents
90 per cent, of the nation, secures about 20 per
cent, of the voting power. The second is to
“oppose all unconstitutional political procedure,”
which means that the Association will declare all
procedure that it doesn’t like to be unconstitu-
tional, and then oppose it, Then follows axiom
No. 3 : “to promulgate sound views on national
subjects a simple and comprehensive idea, for
every view that' the Association will lose money
by will be unsound, and every view that pays will
be sound; and behind this comes another noble
platitude by which the alleged “Nationalists”
undertake to “prevent undue interference with
the great producing interests of the colony. ” In
other words, The Bulletin presumes that any
interfeience which will make hours shorter or
wages higher will be “undue,” and any interfer-
ence which makes wages lower and dividends
bigger will not be undue. Further, the Associa-
tion undertakes to “uphold a just balance of
electoral representation ’’—presumably so that its
own crowd may have all the representation and
nobody else have any of it; and to bear a hand “in
order that public credit may be advanced, and the
investment of moneys encouraged ” —which is a
truly “National” aspiration, seeing that 95 per
cent, of the nation has no money to invest, and
no credit either. There is nothing in the docu-
ment about helping anybody save the Association;
its distinguishing features are selfishness, hypo-
crisy, blatant Toryism, and an utter inability to
understand that there is anything worth thinking
about on earth save the fat man’s interests. Its
gall is stupendous, as its title sufficiently proves ;
its stupidity is vast and incredible, else it would
have hidden its programme in a cellar and put a
stone on top of it to keep it out of sight, instead
of publishing it in all its naked foolishness. Its
course of action is indefinite, in which respect it
is strangely suggestive of that sort of conspirator
who always begins and ends by writing out his
theories and signing them, and then taking a
huge, red oath of vengeance, and hiring a skull
and cross-bones; its subscription is moderate;
its pres.ent address isn’t known at this office, and
its secretary is named Epps. And that is about
all.

up, coining atop of Prince George’s alleged
escapades, and the Prince of Wales’ baccarat
business, is awkward for the Guelph blood.
In fear of the future power of the Labour-
party in Queensland some person, whose identity
is kept officially secret, has “objected” to over
2000 of the names that appear on the North Bris-
bane Electoral-roll, each of which names the elec-
toral registrar has marked off, on the formal
ground that he has “reason to suppose that the
person has changed his place of residence.” In
numerous instances, the persons so disqualified
are men who have been born, bred, and all their
lives resident in the electorate. The success of
the Labour-party at the N.S.W. polls has evi-
dently frightened thecapitalistic C.alition Govern-
ment of Queensland.
Apropos the verses, “ Demon Snowshoes,”
in this week’s issue of The Bulletin, we are told
that, at Kiandra (N.S.W.), the champion record
over the snowsbee course (1000 measured yards,
from the summit to the foot of Township Hill),
made five years ago, was 25 seconds—a statement
which is “ hard to swallow.” At Kiandra in the
winter months even the little children.toddle to
school on snowshoes. The shoes in use at
Kiandra are not the Canadian ones, which are for
soft snow, but are identical with the Icelandic
ski, on which a tremendous speed may be attained
over falling ground. This year at Kiandra there
was hardly enough snow for races.
Woman Privilege is coming along with a
vengeance. The wife of one of the Puisne judges
of an Australian province makes constant use of
her husband’s rooms at court, and as she doesn’t
desire to rub skirts with the common herd of law-
clerks and bailiffs who haunt the neighborhood,
she has had a barricade constructed just outside
the Judge’s door. When a limb of the law on a
recent occasion went before His Honor to swear
an affidavit, Her Honor the Judgess took up the
document and read it right through before the
Judge looked at it. It is alleged that the lady
writes out His Honor’s judgments, and thus are
they rehearsed to her before they are delivered in
court. Little surprise would be experienced by
the wigs and gowns, were she one day found in
evidence on the Bench.
The N.S.W. House of Parliament is honey-
combed in parts by the white ant. The library
adjoining the Council chamber has had to be
propped up here and there greatly to the alarm of
the aged councillors ; many of whom are restrained
from clamoring for a new Parliament Ilouse, by
the fear of a land-tax being imposed to meet the
expenditure. The building is a veritable labyrinth.
It consists of three parts, representing three
political eras. The central part was built for
legislative and executive council in the early days;
it is now occupied by the parliamentary library.
The northern wing, that is, the Assembly chamber,
was erected to house the partly elective Legislative
Council. The southern wing in which the
Legislative Council has sat under the present con-
stitution, is a galvanised iron building which was
used as a boarding-house in Victoria in the gold
digging days.
SUNDRY SHOWS.
>♦♦♦♦«♦♦♦«
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Theatre Royal “Gaiety Co.”
Garrick “ The Sunny South.”
Her Majesty's .... “ Woodbarrow Farm..”
Criterion “Sunlight and Shadow.’
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Alexandra Italian Opera Co.
Princess' “Our Flat.”
Huoo “ A Pair of Spectacles.”
Theatre Royal “Merry Wives of Windsor.”
Opera House “ The Corsair.”
They say that “The Prompter’s Story,”
by J. L. Taylor, now running at Her Majesty’s as
house-wanner to “ Woodbarrow Farm,” hasn’t
been played in Sydney before. Be that as it may,
it is original in idea and gave Albert Bernard,
Laura Villiers’ stage-manager, a chance to show
Sydney folks that he is a capable actor; of the
old-fashioned Cathcart school no doubt, but
powerful and true in emotional moments. Gwen-
doline Floyd, in this as in the piece de resistance,
evinced signs of latent ability allied to good stage
presence, a sweet voice and bright manner.
* * *
It is a great pity that the Villiers’ crowd
didn’t open in “ Woodbarrow Farm,” a pretty
little play containing several unhackneyed situa-
tions —all the more acceptable because unsupported
by stage effects. As Allen Rollit, the young
Devonian who goes to London in response to
the calls that come to him from the great world in
the silent watches of the night and at other times,
Julius Knight has most of the grease-paint, and
uses it in a manly and pathetic fashion, marred
chiefly by his dialect, never Devon, simply a cross
between Scotch and Lancashire. A very fine im-
personation of the garrulous country goody is that
of Emily Stafford, and as the double, the lost heir
and his De Castro, F. P. Stevens gives signs of
ability. Other good performances are those of
Geo. P. Carey, as the blustering, boozing adven-
turer, Colonel Dexter; Mr. Watson, in a smartly-
written sketch of a gambling German baron ; and
Clifton Alderson, in a somewhat minor part, as
the villain whose influence is more apparent than
his presence. Laura Villiers gives a carefully-
ttudied reading of the adventuress who is not all
bad, but aw’fly near it. “ Woodbarrow Farm,”
despite sundry defects, is well worth seeing. It is
well staged ; the farmhouse interior by Bruntonis
a slab out of the heart of England, whose harmony
is outraged by the introduction of a Chinese-made
seven-and-sixpenny “safe” in place of an oaken
cupboard.
** * *
Of the concluding nights of “ Led Astray,”
there is little to be said, except that
Nellie Mortyne was scarcely suitably fixed
as the Countt ss, vice Constance Deorwyn
removed to play the unmysterious “Mystery”
at the Garrick, while Arthur Lawrence,
as the ex-croupier, was even more uncertain
in his Irish than his predecessor, Edward
Sass, taken away for the uses of Melbourne Bijou.
“ Sunlight and Shadow,” by R. C. Carton, played
for the first time in Australia on Wednesday
night, is the story of the unhappy loves of a
choirmaster. It will serve to introduce Marie
Fraser to Sydney audiences. Pattie Browne and
Jenny Watt-Tanner will support her with Messrs.
Titheradge, Lyndal, Bouoicault and Lawrence.

“ Potter of Texas” is a four-act drama-
tisation of Gunther’s novel, by George Darrell,
that has not, so far as we know, been previously
played in Sydney city. Briefly, it is a tale of tlfe
rescue of a lady of fortune from the grip of two
Alexandrian Arabs, who desire to kidnap her for
the royal harem, - by an Australian admirable
Crichton. Out of gratitude the lady assists
her hero to recover from his wounds, and, also out
of gratitude, does her level best to ruin and dis-
grace him by estranging him from the girl
of his heart, and showing up his father
as a returned convict. Of course she
doesn’t succeed, for her hoary-headed scoundrel
of an aristocratic papa is ultimately dis-
covered to be guilty of the crime that sent an
innocent man abroad, &c., and the curtain falls
on a scene of peace and triumphant virtue. Of
course, George Darrell is the virtuous and manly
hero—he always is. He was constructed for the
purpose, but it isn't so evident why Christine
Darrell should be the spasmodically wicked
peeress. The comedy, of a somewhat variety
show character, is chiefly supplied by A. G.
Poulton and A. Shine ; and Arthur Greenaway.
Miss Clitheroe, Conny Deorwyn, Geo. Chalmers,
and others wedge in slices of neutral-tinted matter
w’here required. Mr. Wilson’s scenery deserves
special mention, and manager “Dick” Stewart
announces “ Sunny South ” for Saturday.
** * *
“ Cinder-Elleu, Up Too Late,” went on
at Sydney Royal on Monday night. The story
is a little more like a story and less like a
variety show than that of “ Ruy Bias,” inas-
much as the plot is in evidence, according to pro-
gramme, for fully five minutes after curtain-rise,
while the “Roue’s” plot ended with the entrance
of the conductor. Being a newer burlesque than
its predecessor, the jokes in “Cinder-Nellie ” are,
of course, infinitely older. Its music is chirpy
and commonplace ; its puns, archaic; its ballads,
feeble; and its choruses ineffective. Some of its
situations are borrowed wholesale, occasionally
from “ Dorothy ” —and as a work of art it ranks,
musically and verbally, beneath the level of
“Evangeline.” But its costumes are ravishing;
its legs, numerous ; and its dances are entrancing.
The habit dance between Sylvia Grey and
Florence Levey, with its suggestion of horses
pawing and prancing, is a poem in motion,
while that between Nellie Farren and Fred. Storey
is equally clever in the direction of grotesqueness
allied to grace. On the whole, we like Nellie best in

skirts, possibly because we've seen too much of
her otherwise. Cinder-Ellen is said to be her
first stage appearance in feminine clothes for
about half a century, more or less. Leslie
mixes himself up somewhat, by limiting his
fun in a part that must at times be taken
seriously ; his best jokes are of a mechanical
character. Grace Pedley’s first appearance as
a ] e g show is more satisfactory than any of
lier interpolated songs, but all the music sounds
like faint echoes of Offenbach, Sullivan, and
Cellier. As usual, Danby’s fun is of the boozy,
1 dropping variety. None of the scenery is up to
the standard of “ Ruy Biasstuff. The opening
scene is reminiscent of Squire Bantam’s hall in
“ Dorothy,” probably the grand hall of tire Palace,
by Phil. Goatcher, is the most gorgeous. Never-
theless, taking everything into account, Gaiety
biz. will be big during the remaining 14 nights of
the season.

Rice’s “ Corsair,” said to have been a
great success in Newcastle, was produced at
Melbourne Opera House, on Saturday. As a
work of art it runs “ Evangeline ” to a short head,
and it doesn’t come upon the audience with such
a shock. They are educated up to Fortescue, for
instance, and can now regard the circumference
of that monotonous performer without a shudder.
Also Mr. Rice’s original music falls pleasantly
enough upon ears which know exactly what to
expect, whilst the absurdity of the book doesn't
seem unprecedented. The difference between
“The Corsair” and a Gaiety burlesque is repre-
sented by the difference in the two companies.
No money has been spared upon this production.
Well-dressed girls stand around and sing in a
most lavish manner, and when not singing they
are usually dancing a hornpipe. But the job of
making “The Corsair” go is left to the princi-
pals, and the amount of talent that Virginia Earl
can bring to bear upon sucli a task will be quite
understood by all who saw her in “Evangeline.”
Virginia seems to figure as star amongst the
ladies, for Fanny Liddiard’s voice has left her in
the meantime, and George Walton tries hard to be
most funny of the men. Fortunately there is no
heifer in “The Corsair.”

“A Pair of Spectacles’ 1 evidently caught
on, at the Bijou, on Saturday, and the highly
moral tag was listened to with bated breath. A
good start should be everything in the case of
such a charming unconventional little comedy, so
that Anson’s lifelike creation of the vulgar brother
from Sheffield is likelv to become a great favourite
in Melbourne. “ A Pair of Spectacles ” is pre-
ceded by young Boucicault’s sentimental trifle,
“My Little Girl,” but a sudden attack of in-
fluenza prevents the writer from further enlarging
upon the merits of this double bill.

At the Princess’s they were to produce
“Our Elat ” on Monday, and the management
hopes that no more changes will be necessary
until Derby night, when the comic opera company
starts afresh.
* tit tit *
The tuneful Italians sang “The Barber of
Seville” in fine style on Saturday, albeit their
notion of humour didn’t always meet the require-
ments of the case. On Monday the company, who
seem, by the way, a very happy and united
family, were to give Madame Simonsen a benefit
in “Lucia.” That Madame should require a
benefit is the result of bad luck and bad judg-
ment. It was bad luck that the Cuttica s
insisted on appearing first in unsuitable charac-
ters, and bad judgment that has “mounted”
first-class artists in a fourth-rate style.
* * * *•
The cause of the Cutticas being debuted
in “Martha,” instead of “Lucia,” is explained.
A first appearance in Elotow’s opera was one of
their stipulations in the contract with Madame
Simonsen, who wouldn’t venture to try to per-
suade her prize couple out of an idea that
“Martha” displayed them at their best. Of
course it didn’t. All artists, operatic or other-
wise, are apt to misjudge their “ best, ’ and fancy
themselves in characters they are physically ill-
adapted for.

At Melbourne Royal they intend to put
the Bard away in lavender after Friday night.
Many have paid their respects to “The Merry
Wives ” in the form of hard cash, but few of them
seemed to enter into the spirit of the joke as freely
as the two matrons themselves, whose hearty
laughter began to make them look conspicuous.
In truth, the old comedy has not been assisted by
roars of merriment in front since the opening
night, and without such assistance the plot pro-
vokes comparison with modern efforts, and makes
one seriously consider whether the new kind of
amorous fat man —as usually interpreted by Anson
in this country—isn’t a lot more entertaining than
the extinct species. James Cathcart replaced
George Rignold for two or three nights last week,
but George’s knee is all right again now, praise
the saints ! So on Saturday he will suffer perse-
cution as of yore in “The Lights o’ London.” For
about five years Melbourne has lost its “ Lights,”
and the sight of George giving beans to the evil-
doer in the last act will set many a young heart
beating for the first time, besides restoring faith
in their former hero amongst such as have wept
for Master Ford’s weakness of character.
“lolanthe,” followed by “ Charity Begins
at Home,” has taken the place of “The Gon-
doliers ”at the Adelaide Royal. In “lolanthe”
the Adelaide public are introduced to several
changes in the cast, and for the most part the
alterations are a decided improvement. Flora
Graupner is the Phyllis ; Violet Varley, lolanthe;
Elsie Cameron, the Queen; Charles Ryley,
Strephon; Bracy and Syd. Deane, Tololler and
Mount Ararat respectively ; with Howard Vernon
and Tom Grundy in their old places as the Lord
Chancellor and Private Willis. As usual, Billy
Elton fairly revels as Joe in Cellier’s comedietta,
and receives excellent support all round. The
season continues with a prosperity which brings
gladness to the managerial breast, and when the
double bill shows signs of decay everythiiig is
ready for the staging of Ihe Old Guard.

Oscar Wilde’s hon mot, “An unhappy lion in a den of

“ Willy ” Walsh writes from Shanghai, where the
Willard Opera Co. had two more weeks to run ere playing
a return season of six weeks at Hong Kong, that every-
body is very well, thank you, and that Cusie Denver(Ada
Hiker) is anything but dead, and that everybody is a
favourite except the baritone, whose voice has faded as
his bank-balance increased. The Willard songsters
visit Singapore after leaving Hong Kong, en route for
India. Friends and unnecessary mourners will kindly
accept this, the only intimation.

The Sydney Banjo and Guitar Society gave their fust
concert at (lie Y.M.C.A. hall on Friday last, under the

relieved by ballad-singing, and the show was a success.
Olga Nethersole, her brother, and Charles Cartwright,
failing to complete expected arrangements with J. C.
Williamson, sailed for England in the Carthage on Mon-
day last. Cartwright has sold the Australian rights of
“The Idler,” “ The Middleman,” “The Profligate,” “The
Ambassador,” “ Village Priest,” and “Fortune of War”
to B. & B. Some of these plays have been seen in only
one Australian city, and there to short runs inadequately
cast, so there should be money in them yet. C.C. will
act as B. & B.’s London agent for the periodical supply of
new plays and fresh talent, hut hopes to return with a
new repertoire and full company in two years on his own
account.

“ Curley ’" Bellew at the unfounded rumour that he had

to be a lady- of good taste and refinement.’
Little Martin Simonsen made a reckless attempt the
other morning to save a whole shilling at one fell swoop.
He went dodging around the unfrequented places of
Melbourne until he found a shop where they sold some
mystery that looked like lime-light material at fourpence
a pound under usual price. Marlin picked up three
pounds of it, as a bargain to go on with, and then flew
back to the Alexandra on the wings of joy and gave a lad
the greatly reduced article to put into the retort.
Fortunately Reims, the mechanist, was on the spot, and
inspected the boss’s “cheap lot” in time to prevent the
laying of the Alexandra in ruins. Simonsen was going to
make his lime-light out of powdered dynamite, or per-
manganate of explosion, or something.
Adelina Patti is 48. Just about time for her to come to
Australia.
The Gaiety Co. are doing in Sydney even better business
than on their last visit. The weekly takings steadily
average £lBOO or so. It is really believed that comic-
opera, burlesque and pantomime could be run in Sydney
all the year round.
Johnel Sullivan calls his alleged drama “ Onstarts an’

The executive of the Tasmanian Exhibition will never
again ask Snazelle to help at a benefit. They were getting
up a show in aid of the “guarantee fund,” and Snazelle'
was induced to give his services for a certain percentage
on the gross takings. The executive didn’t quite under-
stand the difference between gross and net takings in the
show business, but when S. had duly hooked his share,
and the officials had to pass the hat round among them-
selves to pay up the resulting deficiency, they began to
realise the situation. Now, they want to know where the
“ benefit” comes in.

After all, the sacred lamp of Burlesque is to shine at
the Shaftesbury Theatre, London, which George Edwards
is now running. It is more than likely that “ Blue-Eyed
Susan ” will be the first piece put up there, with probably
Nellie Farren in the caste.
Mr. Lion Margrave, described as “an Australian trage-
dian”—who is he?—made his appearance at the Avenue
Theatre, London, on 26th August in “Othello,” and this
is what the critic of local Daily Telegraph says of the
performance One has to pause a while and think
before one can recall a parallel instance of extraordinary
presumption. Imagine an Othello without one spark of
freedom in his methods, who mumbles his lines yi an in-
distinct monotone. Imagine an Othello like a partially-
washed chimney sweep, whose gestures are those of a
schoolboy giving his first recitation, and whose sugges-
tions of hatred and jealousy are positively laughable in
their lameness and impotence. Imagine this, and you
will have a fair idea of Mr. Lion Margrave’s performance.”
Business-manager Twinning not only denies theßellew-
Potter marriage yarn, but says it is not true that Brown-

Letty Lind has been seriously ill again and unable to do
any dancing. What can be this strange disease that

her Silver King's monarchy, perhaps.
The London Gaiety made a loss of £3OOO on the financial
year just ended, so manager George Edwardes has under-
taken to relinquish his screw if the shareholders don’t

“ Under the Holly,” a cantata composed by the late

more be brought into notice.

Tlie £5OO lawsuit between Fred. Leslie and John

A young signor of the Simonsen Company has been
struck to the very heart, apparently, by one of the chorus
ladies—a timid, shrinking violet sort of maiden, who
considers the signor is very nice indeed. Every night,
after the operah is ovah at the Alexandria, the gentleman
escorts his little idol home, but seeing that he can’t speak
English, and she can’t whisper soft nothings in Italian,
the question of how they manage to converse is more
than the w'atchers of this romance can master. The most
likely theory is that the happy pair look at one another
and sigh in their respective languages, and finish up with
a gentle caress in Volapuk. The Volapukian kiss, for
instance, speaks for itself and can be answered
accordingly.
Artist Phil. Goatcher talks somewhat wearily of going

Bernhardt’s encounter with an iguana in the Australian
wulds. The monster offered a desperate resistance, but
the indomitable courage of the huntress gained the con-
quest. This reminds us somehow 7 of the time when w 7 e
fought 128 rounds with a worm in a dream. Also on
another occasion, when we came home from a banquet
and engaged in a deadly struggle with the doormat, and
the yells of that blood-stained monstrosity were appalling
to listen to, but our unspeakable grit knocked it out after
a two hours’ struggle, in the course of which the air was
filled with blood and fluff and dead mats and other
remains.
G. V. Brooke used to be liked, as Ford, in “Merry

“ Melbournian ” writes: “While Rignold promises us
the ‘ Midsummer Night’s Dream ’ and ‘Julius Caesar,’ we

only score of the ‘ Midsummer Night’s Dream’ is at the
Princess’s, with Jefferson as Bottom, supported by Mrs.
Heir, Rosa Dunn, Julia Mathews, Emma Neville, Heir,
Fitzgerald, Lambert, Stewart, Ireland, and Harwood.
Brooke was fond of Brutus in ‘ Julius Caesar,’ and Barry
Sullivan acted it in a sumptuous revival at Melbourne
Royal, the next being for Creswick, Bijou, and the last in
Miln’s luckless lime. The piece has not been seen in
London West since the German Meiningen Co., 10 years
ago.”
Strangely enough, Maggie Moore’s two attempts at
light comedy—“ The Schoolmistress” and “The Late
Lamented”—were made in Mrs. John Wood’s parts. It
was inevitable that Maggie Moore should fail where the
Anglo-American lady had been an enormous success.
Their styles are as wide apart as the poles. Mrs. Wood is
a fashionable humourist, a funny woman who delights in
Paris costumes, and can put on the “frills” of a real
duchess if necessary. Certainly, she used to play burlesque
parts, and sing comic songs once upon a time ; but even
then she w 7 as just the antithesis of “ Lizzie Stofel,”
naturally and artistically. Putting such different extremes
into tights wouldn’t nearly suffice to make them meet —
the extremes, not the tights.
H. A. Jones w 7 as a soft-goods traveller before he set up
for himself as a dramatic author. The best character in
“Saints and Sinners” was the religious old mercantile
humbug that Jones had met in every English town, quot-
ing Scripture as he beat the price down, and snuffling the
doctrine that a person must have “ business energy and
push ” and a black bell-topper to get into the Kingdom.
Push meaning the shoving-over of everybody who doesn’t
leave a clear path tor the good man.
“Teddy” Finn does the Christmas pantomime this year
at Melbourne Royal—that is to say, he does it up. It is
to be “ Whittington and his Cat.” You are only allowed
about three subjects for pantomime nowadays. First
they paint the scenery, pick music, make engagements,
settle business, and then call in the author. Vincent
Crummies’s affair of the Pump over again.
Bland, Cowper, Dailey, Hay, Lang, Mac-

Old Doctor Aaron, of Sydney, before h e

Somebody sends us a thrilling contribution
about the Melbourne Sparrow Club, which seems
to have been doing some tall shooting lately for a
trophy. We merely write this item to ask the
Club if it isn’t darned well ashamed of itself, and
why it doesn’t go and hit something a little nearer
its own size. A woman-walloping association
even would be about 500 degrees less mean and
stupid, for a woman can either hit back or yell for
the police, but a sparrow can’t. The individual
who kills most small birds for a trophy seems, in
our eyes, just about as distinguished as the person
who stamps on most worms for sixpence. If he
would even go about and hit cats with a fire-
shovel we would despise him a good deal less. He
travels, of course, on the plea that he wants to
improve his shooting, but he would get exactly
the same result if the members of the club shot at
each other, and then they would show that they
had at least the courage of their opinions. His
present excuse is just as lame as that of the person
who kicks a blind man from behind in order to
strengthen his legs.

A Bundaberg (Q. ) Rechabite successfully
claimed sick pay on medical certificates for a fen-
weeks. But the medical man discovered that the
joker was “shamming Abraham,” and placed his
next certificate in a sealed envelope. When the
invalid turned up at the Tent as usual with his
little demand, the secretary read out the follow-
ing :—“This is to certify that (Teeantoast)is suf-
fering from chronic laziness. (Signed),” &c.
Sick pay being refused, the malingerer had the
gall to summon the Tent Secretary for it, but the
local P.M. told him that the Friendly Societies’
Act denied him jurisdiction even though his claim
were good.
When Colonel Bob Ingersoll was in Europe
last, he visited Westminster Abbey for the first
time. As he was contemplating the tomb of
Nelson, the guide said : “ That, sir, his the tomb
of the greatest naval ’ero Europe, or the ’ole
world hever knew—Lord Nelson’s. This marble
sarcoughogus weighs forty-two tons. Hinside
that his a steel recepticle weighing twelve tons,
and hinside that is a leaden casket, ’ermetrieally
sealed, weighing over two tons. Hinside that his
a mahogany coffin holding the hashes of the great
’ero.” “Well,” said the colonel, after thinking
awhile, “I guess you’ve got him. If he ever gets
out of that, cable me at my expense.”

Barillas in existence.
Barillas has entered Guatemala in triumph.
There is no such place as Guatemala at all.
The latest version of the accident to the
German Emperor is that after a good dinner on
board the Hohenzollern the question of strength
cropped up, and the Kaiser, who is said to possess
enormous muscular power in his only available
arm, proceeded to exemplify his strength _ by
taking hold of a heavy iron bar, which he poised
aloft. At the same moment the ship gave a lurch,
and the Emperor, unable to balance himself, fell
heavily and so injured his knee. Talking of
strength, the late mad King of Bavaria was one of
the strongest men in the world. The present
Czar is probably nearly as strong, and Stuart
Cumberland shows a silver rouble which the Czar
bent double between the thumb and forefinger of
each hand. Try to bend a florin and it will be
seen what this means. “ Gussy ” Loftus—son
of the N.S.W. ex-Governor once saw the
Czar, at the request of a lady who wished to
see some of his feats of strength, take a heavy
silver salver and with the utmost ease roll it up in
the shape of a bouquet holder, which he handed to
the fair one as a souvenir.
A correspondent of the Sydney Daily
Telegraph tells over again for the hundredth
time the venerable story of the N.S.W. land
swindler and his swindle; and asks, for the
thousandth time at least, why there is no law by
which that financial carrion bird can be sent
into penal servitude for 15 years, as an exceed-
ingly moderate minimum. Somewhere about the
year 1886 this particular animal bought a few
hundred acres with borrowed money, and piled a
huge mortgage upon them. Then he published the
wonted advertisement, setting forth that this
desirable property was for sale upon easy terms,
extending over five years. The property was
located somewhere on a bright and grassy slope,
with crystal streams scattered here and there,
and the verdure was fresher and more brilliant
than that on any other allotment, and
in general the ground was emerald, and
the sky was azure, and the title was Torrens’, and
everything was gay. The lots were all promptly
sold, six of them falling to the share of a labourer
in the Far North of Queensland. This particular
purchaser toiled for years, and paid up the money
to the last cent; then he sent his wife and family
down to take possession of his farm in this time-
payment Paradise, and prepared to follow them
in person. But unluckily there was no farm, and
no Paradise at all. The vendor had burst; the
estate had been seized by the mortgagee and sold ;
there were no signs of any Torrens’ title ; and the
money was gone hopelessly and beyond all possi-
bility of redress. For, strangely enough, in the
barbarous land of N.S. Wales there is no law that
can do anything to the person who sells a square
mile of mortgaged land to the poor, and collects the
money from the purchasers, and then leaves the
mortgagee to seize the property while he deposits
the proceeds in a safe place and goes broke. The
money has undoubtedly been obtained by false
pretences ; the swindle is a thousand times more
degrading and cowardly than pocket-picking, or
garotting, or plain ordinary housebreaking; but
though there is a statute to give ten years’ im-
prisonment to the shopman who hasn’t rightly
accounted for 18s. od., this particular variety of
infamy is perfectly lawful. There is nothing in
the programme of the “National” Association
about suppressing it. The nominee Upper House
resents any interference with the “sacred rights
of property.” And the nation in general rather
appreciates the fraud than otherwise, for when a
certain politician’s tenants were ejected and ruined
a few years ago under nearly identical circum-
stances, the country left them to drift into the
Benevolent Asylum or any other convenient shel-
ter, but it raised a huge testimonial to the poll
tieian, who softly deposited the same in his hind
pocket and went on his gladsome way in peace.

Justice Webb, of Melbourne, just deceased)
was an estimable, narrow-minded man —a sort of

public got a mere wreck for its money.
Admiral Stephenson, it is said, succeeds

Jos. Symes does not believe in the news-

Sir William Robinson was once present in
his gubernatorial capacity at a gathering of S.A.
children. Somebody called for cheers for “our
Guvnah.” All cheered but one school. In-
terrogated as to why they didn’t cheer, a little
girl remarked, “Our mothers told us not to, be-
cause the Governor is a bad man.” And thereby
hangs a delightful little tale.
Mrs. Erench-Sheldon, the African ex-
plorers, in a paper on her travels, says : “There
was nothing left to me but to get an absolute
control oyer the men ; this could only be done by
the application of a raw-hide whip.” Lovely
woman ! And just notice how the adorable crea-
ture drives a horse : flick, flick, flick ! Just as
she drives a man.
When Sir James M‘Bain used to manage
in person one of his north-eastern Victorian
stations, he was asked to act as a steward and to
subscribe to a race-meeting at Oxley Plains. He
refused, on the ground of the demoralising in-
fluence of such sports, but, in order not to dis-
pirit the promoters, “he would allow not more
than four of his station hands to get drunk the
day of the races.”
N.S. W. Railway Commissioner Eddy,
whose salary is £3OOO a year and who has served
the province for just three years, has been granted
leave of absence on full pay. Mr. Justice Foster,
whose pay is £2OOO per annum, who has served
the colony tiiree years and a half, and who is
seriously ill, was at first altogether refused leave,
and has now only been allowed six months.
What does this indicate ?
The late Dr. Singleton, of Melbourne, is
said to have embraced teetotalism in a fit of
disgust with himself. On one occasion he drank
enough Irish whisky to make him sick, and he
“swore off” between the “Ohrni’s.” Such in-
stances of a strong resolution founded on a weak
stomach are by no means uncommon. The non-
smoker is usually a man who lacks the necessary
obstinacy to fight against that awful feeling of
greenness which waits upon the early whiffs.
Taking his income along with his debts
(remarks London Referee) Dolly Tester’s hus-
band, the Marquis of Ailesbury, has £50,000 a
year, or, say, £lOOO a week. A London sand-
wich-man, recently inquested, earned 7s. a week
and tried to set an example to all of us by living
within his income, his weekly expenditure being
6s. 10d., thus apportioned : Week’s food, 2s. l|d. ;
lodgings, 25.; soap, IJd. ; washing, 4d. ; medi-
um, 2d. ; shaving, Id.; boots and clothing, 2s.
President M‘Bain (Sir James) of the Vic-
torian Legislative Council, has made a heap of
presentations in his time to clergymen, “dis-
tinguished visitors,” &c. The only instance on
record where lie didn’t enjoy the process of
“ handing over ” was when Power, the bushranger,
called on him in company with Ned Kelly. The
presentation took the form of M'Bain’s fine horse
and valuable gold-watch. Mac. felt what be
termed the “ humiliation ” keenly. Not theleast
doubt of it. He’s built that way.
Mr. Charles Lett, who, though much his
junior, was a school-fellow of the late W. B.
Dailey, and one of his closest friends, is having a
Portrait of W.B.D. done by the -well-known
pastellist, Hubert Vos, from a photograph which
was specially taken for Mr. Lett when he was
leaving Australia, and of which only one copy
was printed. This new portrait of Mr. Dailey
will probably find its way to N.S.W. National
Gallery.
Sara Bernhardt was disappointed with the
obesity of the Australians who were presented to
her on her first arrival in Sydney. Her conception
of the Australian was a man long, lithe and lean :
it was quickly dispelled by the proportions of the
first score of gentlemen whose acquaintance she
made. Beginning with Harry M‘Quade, her
experience on her first day at the Australia ended
with a well conditioned ex-Minister of the Crown.
“ Are you English, sir?” she said to him. “ No,
madame.” “Ah! FAT, fat, fat.”
The recently-cabled report that William
O’Brien, M.P., would, on his release from gaol,
be “confronted by his first wife ” seems to have
been a canard— with a basis of some sort, how-
ever. O’Brien did make a youthful alliance with a
somewhat giddy person, but, as she has not been
heard of for many years, it is believed that she k
“fad. In his novel, “When We were Bovs”
O Bnen tells a story of a man’s early marriage
and the disappearance of his wife, and it is believed
that from this source, one Russell conceived the
idea of putting it about that Mrs. O’Brien No. 1
was about to appear upon the scene.
At the end of a blind lane off Forest,
street, Bendigo, lies a memento of the local
millionaire quartz-reefer, George Lansell. It jo
the huge cauldron which George used when he was
in the candle-making industry-long before he
acquired his present colossal wealth. At that
tune George used to advertise, “Lansell’s dips
are the best in the market —try them. Better
than imported. ’ At a public meeting, at which
George was present, his connection with the tallow,
tat industry was referred to, and the advertise-
ment read aloud. George smiled, and said he
well recollected the days “when he perfumed
View Point.”
Nobody ever yet found a Melican man
without an initial in the middle of his name but
the surprising thing about it is that very often it
is only an initial and nothing more. The other
day in a Sydney court, the inevitable Yankee was
being sworn, and when he gave his designation as
Hamilton B. Jenkins Fiske (it wasn’t Fiske, but
that will do), the bench wanted to know what the
B. stood for. It transpired then that it didn’t
stand for anything. It was only a lonely initial
wrecked in a howling wilderness of nomenclature
He had been christened B,in fact, just as he might
have been christened Benjamin I O U Smith X
Jones, and that was all there was of it.
Many great men have been habitues of
the celebrated Cogers’ Hall Debating Institution
Strand, London, notably John Wilkes, Philpot
Curran and Dan. O’Connell. Even N.S.W.’s own
lorn Garrett has aired his eloquence there. It
happened thus. During his last visit to London
lorn did not travel on Reohabite principles and
one evening suddenly found himself in the midst
of the Cogers who were engaged in a heated dis-
cussion of the Home Rule question. After a
while, Tom, in whom the cacoethes loquendi is
always strong when he has whisky aboard, joined
in the debate. A demand from the chairman as
to who the deuce he was, only brought forth the
response that they would soon find out. He has
tolerably strong notions on the Home Rule ques-
tion ; so, undeterred by the frowns of the presi-
dent, he plunged into the subject, and made a
speech which, for eloquence and close argument
has seldom been excelled in that hall during the
present generation. Having delivered himself of
his sentiments in vigorous language, Tom, with
the applause of the audience still ringing in his
ears, popped on his hat and plunged once more
into dark space.
We are too frequently disposed to think
of the rapid growth of Australian cities as
merely incidental to the settlement of a new
country, and to regard the European cities as
old and stationary. It is true that their nuclei
are ancient, but so far as the greater part of
their built-up area is concerned, they are
almost or quite as new as the Australian cities.
They, like our own population centres, have
grown unprecedentedly in recent decades as the
result of modern transportation and industrial
systems. Thus, London to-day is five times as
large as it was at the opening of the present
century. From 900,000 at that time, the
population of London grew to 1,500,000 in 1830;
and by 1855 it had increased to 2,500,000.
Since 1855 it has more than doubled. In large
numerically speaking, and closely crowded
cities, where the breathing space is confined,
and where the microbes and germs of disease
are inhaled by every breath drawn into the
lungs, disease gets a foothold and spreads more
rapidly than in open country places. Con-
sumption, Bright s disease, diabetes, indigestion
and liver complaints attack people though, in
all situations, and usually end fatally if
neglected. The first symptoms, as dimness of
sight, tired languid feeling, headache, neuralgia,
Ac., should be cured by regular doses of
Clements Tonic ; this is the greatest and most
successful remedy know' to science, it cures
disease when doctors and their remedies fail.
V itness the following proof :—“ Kangaroo
Valley, N.S.W., Aprils, 1889. Dear Sir,—l
have very much pleasure in bearing witness to
the great value of Clements Tonic in cases of
lassitude, nervousness, and constitutional de-
bility generally. For more than 12 months I
was a martyr to extreme lassitude, loss of ap-
petite, sleeplessness and their concomitant
train of physical troubles, so much so that I
feared I should have to abandon my profession
as a journalist, writing being particularly irk-
some and laborious to me. I tried several
advertised tonics (?) with little or no good
result, and began to think my case beyond the
power of medicine to cure. However, seeing
your tonic advertised in sonic of my exchanges,
I concluded to try it as a dernier ressort, and I
am pleased to say the result was most satis-
factory. After taking one bottle I found my
appetite much improved ; I could sleep more
soundly, and felt refreshed next morning. I
continued the medicine, taking in all six large
bottles, and gradually all my distressing
symptoms disappeared. 1 now feel myself
stronger than ever, and as near perfect health
as a man who has to bear the strain of constant
literary work can expect to be. I can con-
fidently recommend Clements Tonic to all
persons suffering from loss of nerve force
through sickness or mental overwork, and am
most happy to support my testimony with my
signature, and remain, dear sir, yours faith-
fully, P. Jefferson Wallace, editor and pro-
prietor, Kangaroo Valley Pioneer .” Send for

POLITICAL POINTS
Reibey, M.H.A. (Tas.), objected to the
Eight Hours Bill because “ time is the working-
man’s capital—that which he uses in the produc-
tion of wealth.” Bosh ! His skill, his brains, his
thews and sinews, constitute his capital,
B. D. Morebead has boasted privately
that he will drive MTlwraith out of public life.
Morebead might save his teeth from gnawing at a
file. Mac.’s physical want of condition needs a
venomous opposition as a restorative tonic.
A picnic committeeman at Bourke, N.S
Wales, the other day asked the bandmaster to
play “ God Save the Queen.” “Don’t know it,”
was the reply. “Wha-a-t!” “ And we ain’t
a-going to learn it; that’s more. It’s played out.”
Grey is “an orator, a scholar, and a
patriot,” but Parkes is only “a great figure in
colonial politics ” in Christie Murray’s judgment;
and the Australian republic is inevitable, “ owing
to the vanity and the courage of the Austra-
lians.”
The growing tendency in a Socialist
direction is, indeed, the most remarkable fact in
current Liberal politics, says the Penny Illus-
trated. All the young men nowadays call them-
selves Collectivists. Ten years ago they were all
Individualists.
It is the fun of the world to see a division
in the N.S.W. Council. The old dodderers can’t
remember one another’s names, can’t hear answers
to their queries concerning them, and don’t know
how to spell them when they painfully arrive at
the information.
Melbourne Age opposes woman suffrage
because “it might be the means of returning to
Parliament an Irish Catholic majority.” In other
words, that fine old democrat David Symc fears
“ Let Labour and Capital united be ” in
the same individual.
The electorate of Sturt, N.S.W., is only
45,000 square miles in area.
Sydney Evening News practically declare B
against Woman Suffrage.
An Eight Hours Bill was lost in the Tas-
manian Parliament by only the casting-vote of
the Speaker,
SA. Revenue, for quarter ended 30th
Sept, last, £008,372; an increase upon that of
same quarter, ’9O, of £58,000.
Mr. M’Millan, who resigned the N.S.W.
Treasurership owing to pressure of private busi-
ness, finds time to figure as President of the
Chicago Fair Commission.
Cablegrams say Hancock has ruined Vic-
torian Loan prospects. But, then, who is the
cableman ? Why, the stipendiary confederate of
Han'oock’s deadly enemies.
The Premier of N.S.W. borrowed the
titles of his two Electoral Reform Bills from his
political god, Gladstone; and, as usual, without
the slightest acknowledgment.
Munro, in Victorian Parliament: “Can
Property suffer hunger or thirst, feel cold or heat,
endure sickness, or be imprisoned?” An bon.
member : “ Yes, be locked up.”
When the ladies in the Parliamentary
gallery applauded Premier Munro during his
advocacy, of Woman Suffrage, Mr. Speaker smiled
deftly ahict winked the other eye.
S.A. Civil Service Commission died last
week, aged four years. It lived on fees and
expenses, and usually recommended just enough
savings to balance with its own expenses.
N.S.W. ex-Treasurer M‘Millan says he
would like to see more commercial men in Parlia-
ment. Premier Parkes declares that the com-
mercial men have all been political failures.
“It is not in the power of any man in the
country to prove anything against me.”—Parkes.
Yet see how meekly he bore John Davies’ his-
torical taunt on the floor of N.S.W. Assembly.
The new N.S.W. Parliamentary refresh-
ment-room committee are on the opposite tack
to their predecessors. A very prominent poli-
tician who owed £3 was refused a meal the other
day.
Socialistic literature is at the bottom o*
the British army revolts. It is not very many
years since a soldier was flogged for reading a
Radical paper. Now it is too late to mop up the
tide.
Premier Parkes has had the term “ Com-
monwealth” before Mm for some time. He headed
an article in the Centennial number of Sydney
Daily Telegraph, “ The Australian Common-
wealth.”
A certain eloquent prohibition speech,
delivered the other night in N.S.W. Assembly,
certainly does bear a Striking resemblance to an
oration we have seen attributed to Colonel Bob
Ingersoll.
A few energetic females in the strangers’
gallery of the Vic. Assembly rather gave them-
selves away the other night by hissing Gillies
when he insisted that they would make a rash use
of the suffrage.
Woolloomooloo and Potts Point constitute
the electorate of Fitzroy under Parkes’ Reform
Bill. The name is aptly chosen, as Governor
Fitzroy was a lineal descendant of Nell Gwynne
and Charles 11.
It would be interesting to know on what
principle the lads sent to England, at N.S.W.
Government expense, to learn railway and tele-
graphic work, are chosen. The names would
indicate influence.
N.S.W. Revenue, for July - September

of same quarter last year, £46,510. Year's
revenue, up to same date, £9,914,826; comparative
increase, £505,162.
The Age has taken to reporting Peacock’s
famous laugh as an item in Parliamentary debates.
It gets a line to itself, thus : “ Mr. Peacock, Ha !

Gillies’ smile in print.
Victorian Revenue, for quarter ended
September 30th, £1,907,845; in comparison with

The Tasmanian Parliament has practically
affirmed that the island shall enter any federal
union of four provinces which includes N. S.

THE DANGERS OF VERSE.

(Here she was stuck.)
“Go on,” said mamma, “go on, Pollikins.”

to enfranchise Bridget, but would not be much
averse to enfranchising her mistress.
Chanter, Dickens and Hassell, M.’s.L.A,,
desired to give a vote to N.S.W. property-holders
resident in Victoria. Someone proposed vote by
cable for English absentees, likewise the provision
of asbestos electoral rights for the use of Sheolites
who have left their property behind.
St. James Gazette is enthusiastic about
Bruce Smith, the N.S.W. Treasurer, but says that
he holds the opinions which belonged to the
philosophical English Liberal of 20 years ago.
After this, B.S. will surely consider the advisable-
ness of obtaining a set of up-to-date politics.
The Masters and Servants Act which the
N.S.W. democratic party wishes to repeal, was
carried by old Jack Robertson in the face of a
powerful squatting opposition in both houses; it
was regarded as an ultra-democratic measure in
its day. “ The clock of the world moves on.”
Dobson, who leads the Tasmanian Oppo-
sition, has recovered a farthing’s damages from a
political Scotchman for publishing an electioneer-
ing skit in which sordid avarice and unpatriotic
conduct were imputed to the legal firm of Dobson
and Co. The touchy attorney called five lawyers,
three parsons, and a moneylender to prove the
libel.
Sydney Echo says that “the modern
democrat is a man who, conscious of his mediocrity,
is anxious to drag all above him down to his own
level.” And the modern aristocrat wants to shove
everybody down below his own level, because he
lives by being on top, and he can’t climb worth a
cent.
Bananaland last year, ended JOth June,
drank 6,231,733 gallons of liquor, an increase for
the year of 340,000 gallons. Beer increased from
2,895,259 gals, to 3,204,895 gals.; of native wines
50,000 gals, were drunk, an increase of 10,000 gals.
An average of gallons to every man, woman
and child in the province.
By his strenuous and successful opposition
to the amalgamation of the National Bank of
Tasmania with the Y.D.L. Bank, Premier Fysh
has rendered himself the most unpopular man in
Tasmania. A misguided lunatic, a victim of the
smash, discovered by a policeman lying in wait for
P.0.F., has been deposited in New Norfolk
Asylum.
Of the “six points” of the famous
People’s Charter, which Sir Henry Parkes advo-
cated with all the enthusiasm of his nature in
1838, four points will soon be embodied in the
laws of N.S. Wales. “Universal Suffrage ”is
being brought within the sphere of practical poli-
tics; but on the remaining point, “Annual Par-
liaments,” the old man is silent.
If the Labour members in the N.S. W. Par-
liament want to abolish the running of parliamen-
tary trams and trains, they should table a motion
requiring the Commissioners to furnish on the
first sitting day each week a statement of the cost
of the “special ” trams and trains for the previous
week. The weekly return would soon arouse the
taxpayers from their listlessness.
The absence of a large section of the
N.S.W, Parliament at the Melbourne Carnival
may give Parkes a chance to snatch a vote on the
Commonwealth Bill. A promise should be ex-
torted from him not to raise the Federation-under-
the-Crown bogie during the Cup week. The
Federal Council Enabling Bill was defeated by a
majority of one or two only on Cup Day 1884.
St. James Gazette calmly says that the
N.S.W. Labour-party largely consists of the most
ignorant, brutal and fanatical type of Irish dema-
gogue. That the most of the Labour representa-
tives are not Irish either by birth or blood will at
once be seen from their names. However, The
Bulletin is rather glad to see such statements
printed. Appeal to religious prejudice is Toryism’s
last card.
Burgeon Creed, M.L.C. (N.S.W.), voted
against Langwell’s bill abolishing that obnoxious
labour-conspiracy law of George IY. “because
nothing was put in its place.” Asked if he
considered it necessary to put anything in the
place of the tumours he excised, he replied:
“No, but you might mistake'9, gland for a
tumour.” j.M.C. evidently considers the George
IY. Act a gland.
When the annalist of 1891 endeavours to
discover the causes of the financial panic in
Sydney, he will be egregiously in error unless he
includes in the list the Hon. William M‘Millan.
Had the N.S. W. ex-Treasurer dared to oppose the
Building Society interest in Parliament two years
ago, his bill to regulate the Societies’ procedure
would have become law, and only the shoddy
organisations would have gone bung.
The political virtues of Parkes’ pernicious
Public Works Committee are being rapidly recog-
nised by Australian politicians. It enables a
Premier to command the support of a number of
needy members; it prolongs the life of a Ministry;
it seduces the roads and bridges men from their
party allegiance ; and it demoralises the constitu-
encies and the houses of the legislature. What an
apt instrument in a Premier’s hands !
New York Standard says “ it is unwise to
prejudice the Single-tax cause by presenting the
Single-tax as gospel. Preachers can easily present
the scheme from a Bible point of view.” The
Bulletin undertakes to present any scheme under
Heaven, from pitch-and-toss to boiling your
grandmother, from “a Bible point of view.”
Eight words in the Bible have sacrificed the lives of
seven millions of people, mostly women. The
words are : “ Thou shalt not suffer a witch to
live.”
Remark by “ Sammy ” Tomkinson, of S, A.
Legislative Council: —
Land is the foundation and source of wealth. (Hear,
hear.) The earth is the mother of us all. (Hear, hear.)
Therefore, land ought not to be taxed at all. (Cheers.)
We proceed to extinguish this rash assertion in
one act. If the earth is the mother of Tomkinson,
then the earth’s name must be Tomkinson also,
for names are hereditary. And the earth’s name
isn’t Tomkinson. Therefore, the whole legend
falls through, v
The Bulletin has evidence that book-
binding work is done inside the N.S.W. gaols for
schools of arts, judges, magistrates, and lawyers,
at less than half the cost at which it would be
undertaken by the trade ; and that the vans of a
well-known “big” tradesman are to be seen
leaving Darlinghurst each week with the products
of convict labour. The mats and matting are sold
by the authorities at prices much below those for
which similar goods could be made by free-labour,
but there is no difference in the cost to the con-
sumer, the difference being pocketed by the store-
keeper.
Under Jawbone Neild’s Bill (N.S.W.) “for
the Suppression of Vice,” owners or lessors of pre-
mises converted into houses of ill-fame are liable
to a penalty of £lOO or six months’ hard. Why
not apply this principle to the rich owners of
Chinese gambling-shops? It is nonsense to say
the owners cannot be found. If they cannot, their
agents can be rendered liable, and if there should
happen to be any difficulty about identifying the
agents, then let the State collect the rents from
the Chinamen and hold them till someone comes
forward for his gruel. “Six months’hard !” How
that would make certain N.S.W. Legislative
Councillors sit up!
The junior bar have a tight grip on one
Government billet in Sydney. The leader of the
Government in the Legislative Council is allowed
a secretary, as no salary is attached to his port-
folio. The secretaryship was vacated recently,
audit has again been bestowed upon a very junior
barrister. A manly Civil Service Board, heedless
of the frowns of a Minister, would not sanction
such an improper appointment. Many an intel-
lectual man in the Civil Service would be glad to
have the soft billet, as he would then have a
chance to study law or medicine. But the post
is reserved for junior barristers, an Act of Parlia-
ment to the contrary notwithstanding.
Parkes is going to “favourably recom-
mend” an expenditure of £200,000 of loan-money
on N.S.W. roads, and after that there will only
be £700,000 left, out of the £4,500,000 just
borrowed. The people of the country districts
will feel grateful to Parkes for this, and some of
them will vote for him in consequence. In
Queensland, Victoria, and elsewhere the divi-
sional boards or shire councils look after the
roads, and consequently the people are not under
the necessity of feeling grateful to any politician
every time a rut is filled up or a culvert mended.
That is the exact reason why Parkes has hung fire
with his Local Government Bill for 25 years.
When it is passed a great hunk of patronage will
be gone, and r-oads will no longer bring votes or
gratitude either, and Parkes lives on roads to a
great extent.
In an editorial, the Sydney D.T. says :
If the Upper House is not to have the free rigfit of
reviving such a measure as the Crown Lands Act Amend-
ment Bill, a measure in which no question of taxation is
involved, it has no right to touch legislation of any kind,
and referring Bills to it is a pure waste of time
So it is, brother, a perfect d.t. This opens up the
whole question of the value or uselessness in a
democracy of a Second Chamber—a little prickly
hedge which the D.T. falls crash into, by sagging
on like this
By the deliberate voice of the people (!) however, that
right is conferred on the Council, to be used, presumably
in' s the country’s interest.
Now, when was “the deliberate voice of the
people ” asked anything at all about the Legis-
lative Council —the Hospital for Incurables among
political paralytics—its powers and its privileges?

The Judge aforesaid must be verging on
80 years, yet it is—or was, until very recently—
his custom to eat every morning for breakfast hot
bread right out of the oven, and eggs boiled until
they were as hard as the hob of Gehenna. Which

he ever gave any hotel-keeper on circuit.

A Southern magnate, who died the other
day, left the money he had intended for his son to
the divorced wife of that son. This was done at
the instigation of the latter’s mother-in-law, who,

finding herself the mother of a woman worth
£30,000, and in seeing her wicked ex-son-in-law

Dr. “Diamond” Beaney, of Melbourne,
in making his will appears to have forgotten that
he had many relatives in Canterbury, Eng., who
are in very humble circumstances. A nephew of
his, as a matter of fact, recently applied to an
Australian magnate for employment as under-
butler. It seems a mockery that the Doctor
should have wished to have his virtues recorded
on a monument in Canterbury Cathedral whilst
members of his family were on the books of the
board of guardians. “Diamonds” left £lOOO to
the Cathedral, conditionally on a £l2OO monument
to himself, for which he provided the money,
being erected in the building. The Cathedral
authorities are in a fix, for whilst they
don’t want to lose the “cool thou.” they are
still more unwilling to allow the monument
to be built. A compromise is proposed by
which a mural tablet would be placed in a very
dark corner.
Frank Barnes, of Young Australia,
announces in his paper that Lady Jersey has
offered four prizes for plain needlework, and on
looking them over we notice that two of them are
for night-dresses, and the other two are for speci-
mens of another garment which we are too bashful
to mention. Lady Martin, some time ago, gave
prizes for night-dresses and the other thing in the
same way ; and when Lady Oarington started out
to encourage plain needlework, she also offered
rewards for the same old night-dress, and the
other article which we have endeavoured to indi-
cate. And now The Bulletin would like to
know how Frank Barnes introduced the topic to
vice-regal notice, seeing that he is a bashful
and embarrassed youth, and not at all fitted to
tackle the subject in a plain, bald-headed fashion.

A rather prim Sydney man the other day
entered a toney local restaurant near lunch-time
and took a seat. Opposite him was an eminent-
clerical potentate from an adjoining province,
who was alternately biting a scone, sipping tea,
and making copious notes, probably for a sermon,
in a massive book. The rev. gentleman having
exhausted his provender and ideas took out of his
pocket a comb which he carefully ran through his
whiskers, hair, and eyebrows. Having done this
he carefully cleaned the comb with his fingers,
shook the debris into his scone-plate, and, mutter-
ing something, probably grace, left: the shop.
And so did the other man.

Ex-school-teacher Young, of Albertan (Q.),
who was recently committed for trial at Been-

recent second-marriage proceedings by asking
Parson Hausmann, the celebrant, to brace himself

a bridegroom was heavily fined for having, in the
middle of the marriage-service, helped himself to
a generous snifter from a bottle of spirits with

prosecuted him for sacrilege, or something.

of The Bulletin he brought a libel-action against
this paper and recovered the substantial sum of
£lOOO damages and costs (amounting to a good
many hundreds more, which, as the case was con-
ducted for him by his law-partner, must have
turned him in quite a handsome little lump).
There is no harm in confessing that the verdict
was a proper one, although it is quite certain that
Mr. Robertson could not have suffered a penn’orth
of damage from the allegations made, inasmuch as
they were so thickly veiled that the reference was
unrecognisable even by his own intimates until he
personally brought the article under their notice
with a view to making them witnesses. It
is easy to be charitable with other people’s
money, and when Mr, (now Chief Justice)
Darley, who was Mr. Robertson’s counsel,
said that his client, who appeared to
vindicate his character, and did not come to the
Court with an empt> <ocket and an itching palm,
would devote to charity any sum he might be
awarded by the jury, the latter rose to the occa-
sion and piled on the damages. The Bulletin
has never been able to find out, though it has
made a number of applications on the subject, to
what “charitable purposes” its little thousand
sovereigns were applied. It has heard from time
to time vague rumours that part of the charity
took the form of a very ugly daub (probably
worth, with frame, £7 10s. in a good market) said
to have been painted by a relative of deceased,
which was presented to N.S.W. National'Gallery;
also someth!ngSEbout a window presented to some
church or other, but it fails to recognise any
charity in these matters. In justice to the
memory of the deceased lawyer it would be well if
somebody let the world know how the money
really was applied.

The Baroness De la Zouche (at least she
used to be the Baroness De la Zouche before De
la Z. divorced her a year or two ago) has in Lon-
don raised the old question : “ Drunk or Sober.”
Two policemen deposed that she was fearfully and
wonderfully drunk while riding in the park and
was behaving herself in a manner dangerous to
human life. The house surgeon of the hospital to
which she was taken on arrest emphatically swore
that she was drunk when admitted, and that he
galvanised her into sobriety. On the other hand,
one or two fashionable doctors who saw her some
time afterwards said that there were no signs of
drink about her. And so the charge was dis-
missed.
• • »
A drunk when galvanised properly, at once
becomes marvellously sober, and the electrifica-
tion of boozers is the choicest variety of (German
compound) medical-student-sport. You see a
whiskyfied gentleman carried into the casualty-
ward in an utter state of drunken oblivion, so
completely obfuscated that you can open his eyes
and tickle them with a feather without the
patient objecting in the slightest. Then you take
his boots off and begin galvanic operations on his
soles. Jumping Jehosaphat, how it does make
him sit up ! The fashionable London doctors who
were called in to depose that Lady Zouche could
not have been drunk, stated that galvanism
"was not, under the circumstances, proper treat-
ment for a lady.” Anyone who has seen the
wicked medical students take off a drunken lady’s
foot-gear with a view to scientific operations, will
fully appreciate the humour of the situation.

Rev. Father Somebody, preaching in
Sydney suburbs recently, assured his hearers that
“ Divorce is a modern institution, an outcome of
the modern atheistical spirit.” The rev. gentle-
man is wrong. Divorce is about as modern nn
institution as babies, or sin, or The
earliest reported divorce, as per Mesopotamia
Times and Advertiser file at this office, was in
the days of Abraham, who filed a petition against
Hagar, the lady who started the Prohibition
Society in the wilderness. The only thing modern
about divorce is our way of doing it. Of old, a
hearty and aggressive kick was the only recog.
nised rule nisi, and if anybody objected or gave
further trouble, the rule was made absolute with
a meat-axe. Nowadays we run crowded courts
and co-respondents, and female witnesses who saw
through the keyhole, and other things which are
fearfully and wonderfully made. The enlightened
evening paper, too, reports the utterances of the
said female, and tells how she looked and what
she saw, and what she didn’t see, and why she
didn’t see it; and describes the clothes that the
petitioner had on, and the haggard grin of the co-
respondent. Nobody reported what Hagar, the
great original respondent, had on ; in those days
you simply heard a row in the next tent, and
when you looked out the divorce was finished.
But the principle itself is contemporaneous with
the primeval ape and the prehistoric saurian, and
the first divorce took place when the primitive
Aryan man came home to his tree, and found that
his wife had gone out on all-fours to wink at the
missing-link next door.

Last Friday Gov. and Lady Jersey visited
Tiger Inglis’ Sydney tea-emporium, and there
was nearly a column about it in one of Saturday’s
daily papers. Governor Jersey is nearly down to
the bottom of things at last. The lowest depth of
all is that which Carington reached when he wept
over the burnt bedding-factory, and Jersey doing
duty as a tea-advertisement isn’t far off it. By,
and-bye the Earl will begin taking maimed foot-
ballers home, and there will be items in the
papers telling how he found a cabman and his
fare swearing over a disputed shilling at midnight
and how, like Carington, he nobly got out and
made peace by paying the shilling himself. After
that he will commence to pat neglected infants on
the head, and to embrace sticky babies. The
affable Governor always goes downhill in just the
same way.

When anything “ fetching ” is on at
Sydney Centennial Hall, it is interesting to con-
trast the wild rush of the enthusing crowds for
the seats they pay for in the Hall, and the calm
indolence of eastern gallery invites as they stroll
in to get seats which they don’t pay for. The
fiction is that the gallery in question is reserved
for “distinguished visitors,” of whom 400 or 500
are supposed to be continually out of gaol and in
evidence. Even if the fiction were a fact, this
wholesale deadheading would be pretty rough on
the paying public, who own the Centennial Hall,
but the eastern gallery crowd never are to any
large extent “visitors” to Sydney, and they are
not, as a rule, “distinguished” for anything
except chilled-steel cheek and a fixed determina-
tion to get everywhere for nothing.
# # #
Sydney deadheads are the same at every
gathering. At last oratorio among the D.H.’s
a suburban bailiff was to be seen sitting near an
aspiring pork-butcher and a celebrated local
chronic insolvent, and the only one in the crowd
who ever answered the alleged description was
a gen'leman who was a “ visitor ” some years ago
under Government auspices, and was then “dis-
tinguished ”by a number. The aristocrats who
cadge invites at Government House, billets in
Macquarie-street, free-passes to theatres, and free
feeds everywhere, are equally successful at the
Centennial, and that is why the “distinguished
visitors” there assembled have such a homely
aspect. Being under municipal control, it follows
as of course that the Hall must be heavily dead-
headed ; but, as a matter of favour, we implore
Mayor Manning to try and raise the average
respectability of the city’s guests : if there must
be society loafers in the eastern gallery, let them
be clean loafers and not lewd fellows of the baser
sort. Or, if this improvement cannot be'effected,
it would be some relief if a new set of distin-
guished “visitors” were occasionally allowed to
replace the inveterates who manage to go to 300
entertainments each per year on a total expendi-
ture of Is. 3d. for tickets and tips.
The press is wonder- stricken at the finding,

sobriquet of “ The Wild Scotchman,” who used to
eat glass whenever he was on a stirring jamboree,
and, after he had tapered off horrors with plus
the d.t.—two distinct and utterly opposite stages
of alcoholism, the writer can assure you on his
experienced and professional honour—his thateli
would bristle with the jagged spines of broken
glass that jutted out all over his skull, and he
could lacerate a whole tribe of naked niggers by
charging them bull-fashion with his spikev head.
He didn’t need trephining; neither did he die of a
pane in his skull. The poor fellow who pegged out
in the Sydney Hospital, had probably been dining
on soap-boiler’s waste, seasoned with lime, and
topped off with seaweed. Going recklessly to
sleep with his heated head resting on a wet bag ot
sand some of the particles of alkaline waste, lime,
and seaweed flew to his head ; chemical action
was superinduced between the now sizzling sand
absorbed into his porous skull and these atoms,
and glass was the resultant. His alcoholic dreams
bein" naturally of the bottle, mind triumphed
ove/matter, and psychologically caused the glass
to begin to form itself into the shape of a popular
pizen-holder. Unfortunately, he awoke before
more than the neck had been manufactured—
awoke with a head and a thirst on him before he
could complete the bottle and fill it at the usual
morning pub. The skull, in reactionary disap-
pointment, decomposed, and he was compelled to
turn up his toes. Such incidents are finite common
in the sandy districts of Australia; they are
simply the natural result of a sequence of very
ordinary causes.

How they do love lords, and fleets, and
snobbery, and things in Melbourne ! The demo-
cratic spirit in Victoria appears to be sadly on the
wane, as if the Southern province had expended
itself during the Berry outburst; while in N.S.
Wales the Nationalistic cause waxes steadily.
Perhaps, however, the fervour of the Victorian
welcome to the latest accession to the British fleet
in these waters is in some measure an outcome of
the indifferent reception accorded it in rival Syd-
ney. Sydney regards Melbourne with good-
natured toleration ; Melbourne views Sydney with
sublime contempt.

The other day Pastor Grubb—a shrieking
brother just out from England—held a holiness
meeting at Geelong (Vic.), and scooped the pool in
a way that the pool was never scooped before in
Australia. He told the citizens of the black trans-
gressor who was caked with dirt by the Gaboon
and the ancient Niger; and the brown lost soul
who wallowed in the swamps of the Gambia, where
squashy insects with eight legs hang out, and fat
reptiles perspire amongst the slush, and gigantic
bugs straddle through the ooze and slime; and he
told them so many other saddening tales that the
audience was all flabbergasted and broken up. It
was so badly broken up that Grubb’s hearers rose
and heaved their watches and jewellery to the
preacher, and dashed their purses and pocket-
books on the platform, and some of them
wrote cheques for the naked heathen, and
some made their wills in favour of
that undressed savage, and some volunteered at
once to go forth and preach to him. Grubb had
to hold them with both hands at last to prevent
them giving their clothes and boots and hats to
the lost nigger right there on the spot, and
scudding home with nothing on ; and for an hour
or so these auditors wallowed in a trampled mire
of tears and mud and cash, and ran over each
other and broke each other’s backs in the mad
struggle to get at Grubb and give him the cash.
And yet, when the visible or concrete heathen—
the local beggar, or the Chinaman, or the nigger
selling brass jewellery—came round next morning
there was no enthusiasm about him, and nobody
even remembered that he was really the same in-
dividual who aroused so much enthusiasm the
previous night.

The Australian Anglican General Synod has
recorded its “firm conviction that any extension
of divorce, such as has been allowed under the
Victorian Act, is inconsistent with the Divine
law. A suggestion : Place the sole power of
divorcing (as well as of marrying) in the hands of
the clergy, with thumping fees attached, and
the “ Divine law ” will probably speedily accom-
modate itself to the vox populi.

By the rigid canons of legal etiquette, a

from officers of the Lands Department, without the
aid of any solicitor. As barristers are pretty

In a certain Sydney suburb there was a
girl dying, the other day. She had been ill for
some weeks, and the usual host of sympathetic
friends had called round in the usual silent,
muffled, soft-footed way, and inquired about her
in husky whispers at the door, and then they had
shaken their heads, and hove a long sigh apiece,
and gone away. One of these regular inquirers
Was a young woman whom the family failed to
recognise, but she seemed so sympathetic that
they set her down as a school friend of the patient.
One day, however, they told her sadly that there
was no hope, and instead of going away she
stepped softly into the hall, and wiped away a
tear, and seemed as if she was trying to
speak, but couldn’t do it owing to her
emotion being too much for her. Then she took
something out of her pocket and pressed it with a
long, lingering, affectionate pressure into the
mother’s hand. It was a card, and on it was the
legend, “ John Smith, undertaker, 948 -7 street;
funerals conducted at lowest rates.” I am so
sorry for you,” said the visitor in a sad, sym-
pathetic tone; “if you’ll give a trial I’m
sure he’ll give you every satisfaction.” And then
she breathed another long sigh and trotted away.

Sydney Quarter Sessions, here are two extra-
ordinary cases before Judge E itzhardinge.
Murray, found guilty of stealing a purse, contain-
ing a few shillings, from a lady’s pocket (first
offence), three years. Robert Mathieson, guilty
of breaking, entering, and stealing £BO worth of
jewellery (very little of which was recovered, the
prisoner refusing obstinately to assist the police to
that end), two years in an easy gaol (Dubbo).

according to the condition of the Judge’s liver or
something.—Yours, etc., H.V.A.

The other night a Melbourne youth was
going peacefully homeward along the St. Kilda-
road, when he was roused to sudden activity by
the screams of a girl some little distance ahead.
It was dark and the road was lonely, but the
young man instantly dropped his cigar and rushed
wildly to the rescue. He shot round the next
corner, and there clinging to a lamp-post was a
distracted maiden with her hat damaged, and a
cascade of glossy brown hair rolling down her
back, and a look of dreadful alarm in her large
bright eye. Behind her was an enormously fat
man with two chins, and a disorganised bell-topper,
and a bald, red head that was smoking with
excitement, and a huge red face; and he was try-
ing to climb over his white waistcoat and his
vast stomach and kiss his captive. He was just
about to succeed when a fist arrived in his eye
with a squashy sound like a dumb-bell hitting a
bad melon, and as he let go with a yell he got an
awful biff in the other eye, and one on the ear
that rolled him over. Then the victor gave him
a fearful and tremendous kick, and after that he
took the aged reprobate by the pants and the
collar, and scrubbed him up and down in the
gutter. When he had finished this exercise he
escorted the frightened girl home, and had a good
time generally. It was nearly two hours later
when he got to the paternal mansion, and the
first thing he saw on going in was his own old,
bald parent in an evil plight. He had beefsteak
on both eyes, and his head was swelled so much
that he needed a No. 18 hat, and he had both his
feet in hot water, and a cooling lotion on his
stomach. Also, he had lost two teeth, and con-
sequently was relating with considerable difficulty
how he had fought with 18 larrikins —and left
four of them insensible in the road —in defence of
a helpless girl.

To Radam’s Microbe Killer Company.
Dear Sirs, —I have been a great sufferer for over
sixteen years from pains in the legs from the hips
down to the toes, and also in great misery for
nine years from a kidney disease, during which
time I found I was losing the use of my legs,
particularly the right one, from weakness in the
joints. I tried nearly every known remedy, and
received but little relief until I commenced to use
the MICROBE KILLER.
It is now eight weeks since I commenced its
use, and having used two one-gallon jars, I find
myself an entirely different man. I believe a
little more will entirely cure my complaints, as I
can say that I have not felt so well for eight or
nine years, and can now do my work as well as
ever I could, and also enjoy my meals, which for
many years I could not. —I remain, yours thank-
fully,

VAGARIES OF MACISTRATES
hear a great deal from time to time of the
* * vagaries and eccentricities of Judges and
Magistrates, and of late the matter has been, not
infrequently, the subject of heated and acrimoni-
ous debate on the floor of the Legislative Assembly.
Chamber. Purity and sound judgment in thd
persons of those who are empowered to administer
our laws are to be desired above everything if
a country is to avoid reproach and ridicule. The
expression, “Justice’s justice,” has become a bye.
word, and conjures up many unpleasant memories.
Perhaps one of the best stories in this connection,
and one which has a humorous side to it withal,
comes from New Zealand. It is an old story, but
a true one. A certain Northern Justice of the
Peace, who resembled necessity in that he “knew
no law,” was called upon to adjudicate in a case,
preferred against a man whose “looks were agin’
him. Almost before the evidence was concluded
the sapient J.P. exclaimed, “Three months ; take,
him away; his face is enough to condemn
him. 1 Fortunately the then Provincial Council
of Auckland happened to be in Session,
and the same evening a member brought
the matter before the Council, and moved
an urgent address to the Governor to release the
man at once. The way this member carried his
point with the Council was unique. He glanced
round the chamber impressively, and said, “I
should like to know what honourable member
will be safe, if people are to be sent to gaol for
having ugly faces.” That fetched them. It was
an argumentum ad hominurn that was irrefutable.
The motion was carried unanimously, and the
man with the disfigured physiognomy released.
It seems that the unfortunate victim of the
Justice’s stupidity had acquired the peculiar
expression of countenance, which so nearly proved
faFal to him, as the result of a painful facial
affliction, from which he had suffered for years,
unconscious of the knowledge that a proper use
of St. Jacobs Oil would have relieved his suffering,
and restored to its pristine beauty the deformed
index which was the involuntary cause of his
trouble.

For the Cure of
All throat and lung diseases, Ayer’s Cherry
Pectoral Is the best known remedy. When the
bronchial tubes are sore and obstructed with
phlegm, this medicine is invaluable. It is an
anodyne expectorant, and, in cases of deep
seated consumption, it cures the coughing,
soothes and heals the lacerated tissues, and
induces refreshing sleep. A few doses are usu-
ally sufficient to afford speedy relief in cases of
Colds and Coughs
It is also as speedily efficacious, and prompt
to allay the distressing symptoms of asthma,
bronchitis, sore throat, hoarseness, croup, and
whooping cough, and. in thousands of fami-
lies, is the only cure used. It is the best emer-
gency medicine and should always be at hand.

dren, can afford to be without

SPORTING NOTIONS.
'ilie inaugurating shriek of the racing Car-
nival ” will be beard on Saturday (10th) at Caulfield, after
which day the very air of Melbourne will smell of stable,
and any creature resembling a tout will be regarded with
'silent awe as be leans against a lamp-post with a straw
protruoi ig from his facial chasm. Suurday is Guineas
jjjjy, the great annual occasion when people who “know
something” can sometimes get good odds against it, and
those who know nothing have to buy their information
as they go along. The unexpected happens with great
regularity in this annual dawning of the Carnival, and
“ form ” (the last year's) is upset as violently as the stalls
at a Beauty Show. Consequently no racing card of the
season is fuller of melancholy interest, after the event,
than that which commences with the Caulfield Stakes.
The Stakes is worth considering, inasmuch as three great
performers—Mentor, Dreadnought, and The Admiral
have won it in the last three years. Such good ones as
Bungebah, Marvel, Megaphone, Tirailleur, Cuirassier, and
Malvolio are among the present entries, and if the last-
named should make a vigorous show against one or more
of the top-sawyers be will look like a rather moribund
fowl for the Melbourne Cup right away. All the likely
V.B.C; Derby candidates are entered for the Caulfield
Guineas, too, so it is more than possible that the betting-
market, such as it is at time of writing, will be turned
inside out on Saturday, along with the pockets of a good
many punters.

Bookmaker Bill Branch, who died the other
day in Melbourne, was a most impassive gambler. It is
related that a friend of bis once noticed him camped
asleep with his pockets turned out, and awoke him with
the intelligence that lie had been “gone through,” point-
in'’’ to the inverted tell-tales. “ Oh, it’s all right,” mur-
mured Bill, “I was having a camp after losing every
blessed cent. I turned my pockets inside out to let any
passer-by see that I wasn’t worth investigating.”
# # *
Ere joining the turf the late “Bill” Branch
was usually occupie 1 in “seconding” fighters in the
prize-ring. lie seconded Joe Kitche iin his big fight with
black Harry Sallars, a fight which lasted four hours, both
me.i being blind at the finish. Sallars. unquestionably,
was the belter man of the pair, but, being a stranger,
Branch and his friends bustled him out. Sallars had a
benefit given him at the old Prince of Wales in Lonsdale-
street, on which occasion the giant Black Perry—who had
unfortunately killed a man in fair fijglit—put on the
gloves with Tom Curran, but after the first round took
them off and could not be induced to put them on again,
although he had shown to advantage.
# # *
Said Branch; “At hazard, backing the ins
wilt strip you to your shirt, and backing the outs will
strip you to your boots.”

Pugilist Fitzsimmons, writing in a ’Frisco paper,
sneers at Hall who, he says, is not eager to fight. He
despises H ill, whom he can beat as sure as the sun shines.
“ Why shouldn’t I lick him ? I licked him twice before
already. lam cleverer, bigger and more experienced
than when I beat him years ago, and there is no reason
why I should not win from him now.” Fitz. offers to
fifht Hall, betting him 6000 dollars to 5000, the battle to
take place in some secluded spot with ten witnesses on
either side, or he “ would agree to go into a room with
him for two dollars a-side without a soul but ourselves.
Any style of fighting that suits him will suit me.” Fitz-
simmons says bis heart is set on fi filling Pritchard, of
England. Corbett, on the other hand, is enthusiastic
about Hall, who, he says, is the bdst boxer he ever sparred
with, and would beat Fitzsimmons.

A new American yacht, a real flyer by all
accounts, has just demonstrated to the Yankees the fact
that deep-keeled yachts are more than a match for centre
hoard boats. This vessel, the Gloriana, a 46-footer, has
for the eightli time shown her heels to the fastest boats
of her class, including the well-known Beatrix, designed
by Burgess, of Volunteer fame.

There was quite a big Austral an show at the
recent Goring (Eng.) regatta. Sir James Garrick has a
house on that charming part of the Thames for the
season, and he had a large number cf guests. The
challenge fours fell to a crew of cornstalks, the two
Garricks, Ned Lord, and Drury, a Bananalander. In the
dongola race (a race for punts propelled by eight paddles,
two ladies and two gentlemen, each side) Bailey
Macarthur and fils sister Miss Enid Macarthur took part.
Their crew was second. The Garricks also won the pairs,
so that altogether Australia did well.

When llenuiker Heaton occupied a responsible
position in connection with Sydney Evening News and
T. and C. Journal, a very severe paragraph appeared in
the sporting portion of one of those papers reflecting in
no measured terms on the manner in which a boat,
belonging to Sydney Want, had been managed in some
race or other. Next day, Mr. Want, accompanied by a
friend, entered Henniker’s sanctum, demanding very
warmly the name of the writer of the offensive par., and
threatening no end of pain and penalties ; he wound up
by giving Heaton twenty minutes in which to make up
his mind either to give up the name of the writer or take
the consequences. As soon as he had gone Heaton put
on his hat and went off to tell the writer of the paragraph
what had happened. “By all means,” said that gentle-
man, “tell Mr. Sydney Want that I wrote what has
so offended him." Shortly after Mr. Want if
possible more irate tjian ever. “Well,” said Heaton, it
is not usual to divulge the name of the writer of anything
which appears pi ouy paper, but in this instance I nave
the writer’s permission -to do so. Mr. J. 11. Want,
barrister-at-law, wrote it." “Come along, Tom, ’ said Mr.
Sydney Want to his friend.

The Argus dished up the result of the Lan-
cashire Plate along with an extraordinary outrage by a
hand of armed men in San Antonio. The three placed
horses in the Plate figured as the name of the ringleader
in the outrage—Signorina Orme Martagon. It would
take the Argus a long while to dash off such a good joke
wilfully.

In reference to Bookie Bill Branch, a histori-
grapher recalls his old friend, Leviathan Slack, a per-
fectly ignorant man, who used to fill his betting-book with
Egyptian hieroglyphs, and translate them to little Ward,
the barber, his secretary. Slack’s wife kept a Metho-
dist Chapel going in Prahran, so that it shut up when he
had gone.

Branch figures in clever Lascelles’ well-known 50

One of Roberts, the champion billiard-player’s
daughters is quite an artist at the game, some of her
strokes being up to the old man’s form. An excited
admirer, the Other day, wanted to back her against
any player in South Australia, Miss Roberts to con-
cede 500 in 1000, spot-barred. Nothing came of it,
however.

People never before heard of in Sydney senior

more lung capacity than smokers. Hum ! So much more

maggot. Smokers can’t be scared into weed-abandon-

Larry Foley avers that it is untrue, as stated,
that he ever thought of offering a scrapping benefit to
Postmaster-General O’Connor. Also, he points out that
when he interfered in the Dora Wiley trouble, mentioned
in a recent issue of The Bulletin, he did so purely in his
capacity as lessee of Sydney Gaiety Theatre.

Some people deride the idea that Pritchard
should challenge Joe Goddard, but the latter tsuwtastilg
or strong nor one whit cleverer than the Tipton Slasher
whom Tom Sayers, no bigger than Pritchard, beat. Of
course weight counts for more in a glove than in a ring
fight, but against this we must remember that Pritcham
made short work of Jem Smith, who at one time had a
reputation second to none, and quickly settled Jack Burke.

All sorts of yarns were rife last week as to the
quantity of cleverness Jack Ashton had concealed “ up his
sleeve,” but after the American’s showing with Joe
Goddard in Melbourne on Friday night it did not appear
as if there was much truth in the rumours. Joe, as per
usual, started to plough his way clean through his man,
and it was only by ducking and clinching that Ashton
managed to survive the stipulated number of rounds.
The Yankee was seconded by John L. Sullivan, but even
that did not frighten Joseph. Ashton cut by far the
sorriest figure of all who have faced Goddard, forChoynski
and Doolev, and even little Billy M’Carthy knocked the
tornado down before their strength was worried out of
them.

Mick O’Brien, the well-known jockey, has gone
to Melbourne from Hay, much improved in health through
his trip to Riverina. O'Brien’s trouble is asthma, and if
any place on earth will relieve asthma it is Hay. A
man known to the writer had suffered from asthma from
boyhood, and at seventy years of age he visited Hay and
stayed there, for some fifteen months. He never again
was troubled with the complaint and lived till nearly
eighty.

“Sullivan is the coming champion sculler of the
world,” remarked an authority on these matters the other
evening- “ But what about Stansbury?” “ Sullivan can
beat Stansbury with ease,” was the reply, “ and if Searle
were alive and at his best I would put the pair in the hat,
and just as soon draw one as the other.”

Ohoynski, the game, gentlemanly and clever,
but scarcely heavy enough American fighter, was ban-
queted and‘benefited in Sydney ere his return to America
in the Alameda. He leaves Australia with the good will
of all.
After all, David Christie Murray had some
excuse when he said there was much bad language
used in Australia. He probably listened to the
people blaspheming on the front steps of the hall
as they came out from his lectures.
The Theatre Royal Hotel, Sydney, has
lately changed hands, and is now under entirely
new management. A splendid stock of wines,
spirits, liqueurs and cigars has been laid in, and
an altogether new feature is provided in the shape
of an American bar, where all the strange, curious
and refreshing drinks known in the United States
can be obtained. Their name is legion, but among
them may be mentioned champagne cocktails,
gin fizz, milk punch, mint julep—probably the
noblest liquor known to man—imperial punch,
Manhattan cocktails, and many others. All
mixed by American bar-keeps. James A. Walsh,

“A GOLDEN SHANTY.”
The Demon Snow-Shoes.
(A LEGEND OF KIANDRA.)
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I he snow lies deep on bill and dale,
In rooky gulch and grassy vale,
The tiny, trickling, tumbling falls
Arc frozen ’twixt their rocky walls
That grey and brown look silent down
Upon Kiandra’s shrouded town.
The Eucumbene itself lies dead.
East frozen in its narrow bed,
And distant sounds ring out quite near,
The crystal air is froze so clear,
While to and fro the people go
In silent swiftness o’er the snow.
And, like a mighty gallows-frame,
The derrick in the New Chum Claim
Hangs over, where, despite the cold,
Strong miners seek the hidden gold.
And stiff and blue, half-frozen through.
The fickle dame of fortune woo.
Ear out, along a snow-capped range
There rose a sound which echoed strange,
Where snow-emburdened branches hang,
And flashing icicles, there rang
A gay refrain, as towards the plain
Sped swiftly downward Carl the Dane.
His long, lithe snow-shoes sped along
In easy rhythm to his song ;
Now slowly circling round the hill,
Now speeding downward with a will;
The crystals crash and blaze and flash
As o’er the frozen crust they dash.
Among the hills the first he shone
Of all who buckled snow-shoe on.
For though the mountain lads were fleet,
But one bold rival dare compete,
To veer and steer devoid of fear,
Beside this strong-limbed mountaineer.
’Twas Davy Eccleston who dared
To cast the challenge, “if Carl cared
On shoes to try their mutual pace,
Then let him enter for the race,
Which might be run by anyone—
A would-be champion.” Carl said “Done.”
But not alone in point of speed
They sought to gain an equal meed,
For, in the narrow lists of love,
Dave Eccleston had cast the glove,
Though both had prayed, the blushing maid
As yet no preference betrayed,
But played them off, as women will,
One ’gainst the other one, until
A day when she was sorely pressed
To loving neither youth confessed,
But did exclaim —the wily dame,
“ Who wins this race, I’ll bear his name.’
These words were running in Carl’s head
As o’er the frozen crust he sped,
But suddenly became aware
That not alone he travelled there,
He sudden spied, with swinging stride,
A stranger speeding by his side;
The breezes o’er each shoulder toss’d
His beard, bediamonded with frost,
His eyes flashed strangely, bushy-brow'd.
His breath hung round him like a shroud.
He never spoke, nor silence broke,
But by the Dane sped stroke for stroke.
“Old man ! I neither know your name,
Nor what you are, nor whence you came;
But this, if I but had your shoes
The championship I ne’er could lose.
To call them mine, those shoes divine,
I’ll gladly pay should you incline.”
The stranger merely bowed his head—
“The shoes are yours,” he gruffly said;
“I change with you, though at a loss.
And in return I ask that cross
Which, while she sung, your mother hung
Around your neck when you were young”
Carl hesitated when he heard
The price, but not for long demurred,
And gave the cross; the shoes were laced
Upon his feet in trembling haste,
So long and light, smooth-polished, bri, lit.
His heart beat gladly at the sight.
Now, on the morning of the race,
Expectancy on every face,
They come the programme to fulfil
Upon the slope of Township hill;
With silent feet the people meet,
While youths and maidens laughing greet.
High-piled the flashing snowdrifts lie,
And laugh to scorn the sun’s dull eye,
That, glistening feebly, seems to say—
“When summer comes you’ll melt away :
When I grow strong you’ll change your song
I think so, though I may be wrong.”
The pistol flashed, and off they went
Like lightning on the steep descent.
Resistlessly down-swooping swift
O’er the smooth face of polished drift
The racers strain with might and main.
But in the lead flies Carl the Dare.
•Behind him, Davy did his best,
With hopeless eye and lip comprn sed ;
Beat by a snow-shoe length at nun t
They flash and pass the winning-post.
The maiden said “ I’ll gladly wed
The youth who in this race has led.”
But where was he ? still speeding fast,
Over the frozen stream he pass’d,
They watched his flying form until
They lost it over Sawyer’s Hill,
Nor saw it more, the people swore
The like they’d never seen before.
The way he scaled that steep ascent
Was quite against all precedent,
While others said he could but chose
To do it on those demon shoes ;
They talked in vain, for Carl the Dane
Was never seen in flesh again.
But now the lonely diggers say
That sometimes at the close of day
They see a misty wraith flash by
With the faint echo of a cry,
It may be true, perhaps they do,
I doubt it much, but what say you ?

The Second Mrs. Jowker : A Bush Sketch.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The tin-mining township of Piligi was
once a lively place, they say. This shows what
deceitful things appearances are. A visitor to
Piligi at the present time—if there happened to
be such a person, which there never does—would
come away, as speedily as possible, with an undy-
ing conviction that the place ever was, is, and
will be the abode of utter desolation, rusty fish-
cans and empty nothingness. There is a road
passing through Piligi, but it is never used except
by a stray Chinaman —who comes in to sell 6pb.
of tin to the publican—or a mob of predatory
goats out on a foraging expedition for gunny-bags
and jam t'ns. This road bisects Piligi, and just
one-half of the town used to adorn each side of it.
The pub. occupies one side of the street, and on
the other there was, until lately, a composite
structure of bark and gin-cases, which was
alleged to be a store. The stock-in-trade was
principally sardines, and a purely malignant kind
of tobacco; but sometimes there were several
bottles of salad-oil on the shelves, as well as a bag
of sugar and some kerosene and a box of candles
under the bunk in the back roqm. This was the
emporium of Mr. Thomas Jowker, who, with the
publican and his family opposite, constituted the
population of Piligi.
« « #
Jowker owned two rectangular beasts dis-
tinguished as horses, also a blue-painted wag-
gonette with four odd wheels and a stringy-bark
pole, lie used to tie his two quadrupeds to this
machine twice a week, and disappear over
the creek into the depths of the bush,
in a frantic endeavour to sell something
to the miners who were supposed to haunt
its recesses. I believe he did find a man
sometimes, at the bottom of a hole, but the per-
centage of man per hole was small, and it is a
wonder Jowker did not get discouraged when he
used to drive up to, and look down shafts all day
without finding anyone. Ahd*»vhen he did discover
an underground toiler, he almost always met with a
liscourteous reception, and was told to go to
fophet out of that with his bloomin’ old rattle-
trap. And when Jowker’s beasts wearily'hauled
the chariot homo again, Jowker would be told by
the publican that there was a regular procession
of would-be customers in bis absence, and tint
they had all gone away swearing at Jowker for
not being at home. Put when the unlucky mer-
chant did stay at home, the customers did like-
wise. • It was only on the occasions of Jowker’s
pilgrimages into the bush that people were seized
with a longing for Jowker’s merchandise,
* # # ■
Realising that his inability to remain at
Piligi and hunt up diggers at the same time, wafi s
causing him to suffer heavy cash losses and
depreciation, Jowker soliloquised. After a long
tune spent in consideration, he engaged an old
derelict fossicker of his acquaintance to mind the
shop wh le he—Jowker—was engaged elsewhere.
Harry was to receive free board and lodging and
half-a-puuud of the malignant tobacco weekly fur
ms services. Put 1 tarry proved to be a man of
deceit; for whenever he did sell any of Jo.wker’s
goods' he straightway meandered to the pub.
opposite and remained there, as long as circum-
stances— and funds —permitted. Then when
Jowker returned in the evening Harry reported
no sales.” Put Jowker missed the goods which
dis unjust steward had disposed of, and he also
detected a powerful rum-aroma mingled with
Harry’s breath, and therefore he fired Harry out.
# # *
This last disaster strengthened an impres-
sion that Jowker had had for a long, long time.
He would have to get married again. For there ■
had already been a Mrs. Jowker. She had
died partly through Jowker’s ill-treatment, and
partly through starvation—Jowker’s disposition
being very frugal. It was this element of
penuriousness in his character which had hitherto
prevented him from taking another partner—“ a
woman do eat such a of a lot,” he would say.
But he now determined to invest in a helpmate
as an economical and prudential measure. She
surely would not eat as much as that rogue Harry
used to drink.
So, one evening the blue-painted wagonette
brought a fresh inhabitant to Piligi. She was an
athletic woman, with a firm jaw and a brisk
moustache; and Jowker made it known that if
satisfaction were given during a week’s trial of
domestic virtues, he intended to bestow his hand
and heart upon this lady. This bargain had been
cheerfully agreed to by the prospective bride, who
entered upon her housewife duties at once. The
week of probation passed rapidly; . the new r
arrangement had proved highly satisfactory, and
on Jowker’s next visit to “ town ” he was accom-
panied by the muscular female, who returned
with him to Piligi as Mrs. Jowker No. 2.
# # *
For the next few weeks there was nothing
but peace, and joy, and love in the Jowker house-
hold. Mrs. Jowker cooked her husband’s meals,
she washed his clothes, and she attended to the
shop when he was away. She chopped wood,
drew water from the creek, and heaved rocks at
the goats. She reared a crop of chickens, another
of ducks, and had a few young turkeys in various
states of impaired health recuperating in the
grateful warmth of the camp-oven. She adorned
the shop window with a deftly-arrayed assortment
of mixed goods, judiciously varying salad oil and
pickle bottles with samples of soap and bacon and
copy-books. Altogether Mr. Jowker was delighted
with the result of his experiment.
But one evening when he came home, Mrs.
Jowker was not there to bid him welcome and
hobble out his horse as usual. There was a sound of
revelry in the bar of the pub. opposite, and Mr.
Jowker was not long in discovering that it was
chiefly caused by Mrs. Jowker. The one weak
point in that lady’s character was displayed at
last. Mrs. Jowker was “on the guzzle ” !
# * *
Jowker had encountered many specimens
of hard language in his time, but the hardest of
them were but mere baby-prattle to the unsancti-
fied expressions which now proceeded from Mrs.
gJowker’s mouth. She made disparaging remarks
personal appearance. She in-
sulted the"’memory of his ■. ancestors for many
generations aud briefly apriounced‘ her
intention of laying 6m ’with -ar'i"J>ottle‘'as
soon as she had time. ,Tl%ii she.uttered a long
series of demoniac shrieks, flni% a tumbler at the
publican, and |ay down on the floor to drum her
heels on the boards-aiid sing “ Willy Reilly.”
Jowker ,was almost paralysed with surprise.
- But -vvlien he entered his home lie became seriously
angry as well. The interior of the place was quite
disorganised ; kerosene and sardines and tobacco
strewed the floor which was besprinkled with
flour. Thirteen fowls with dislocated necks were
on the bed. The remains of the bedding were
smouldering at the back of the fireplace, and
Jowker’s entire stock of crockery lay in fragments
on the ash-heap. The only part of his premises
that had escaped disaster was the front shop win-
dow. Here, behind the four pane window-sash
were seven bottles of salad oil and a ham which
Mrs. Jowker had evidently overlooked.
Jowker prepared his own evening meal that
night. He had crossed the road to remonstrate
with Mrs. Jowker, but she was asleep at the
time, and when he endeavoured to arouse her she
struck him heavily with a bottle. So Jowker
returned home and decided on a “lock out.”
At 1 a.m. he was aroused by Mrs. Jowker’s
demand for admittance. Her language was unduly
coarse, and Mr. Jowker refused her request. Mrs.
Jowker increased the intensity of her talk and
subsequently went round to the front. Here she
poked out the four panes of glass with her
umbrella and raked down the seven bottles of oil
and the ham with one sweep of her nervous right
arm. The crash started .1 owker out of bed, but
he was only in time for an indistinct vision of an
active female fleeing towards the Creek with an
umbrella and a ham amid coruscation of swear
words that startled the very goats.
Jowker had hardly got to sleep again before
another explosion of language aroused him. He
sallied forth this time with a pick handle, but was
not agile enough to get within range of the des-
troyer of his rest. She fled across the creek with
the velocity of a frightened wallaby, and crashed
through the scrub on the other side with a series
of intermittent yells. Jowker stubbed his toe
badly and limped home swearing. But Mrs.
Jowker was there almost as soon, and fired stones
into the premises through the broken windows,
and the performance was continued with un-
flagging energy until morning and the opening of
the pub.
# # #
Jowker saddled up one of his steeds in
the morning and went into Bogalong for a police-
man. When the trooper arrived at Piligi, Mrs.
Jowker was engaged in bombarding the hostelry
with large rocks. She had been expelled by the
landlord because her supply of cash did not cor-
respond with her desire for liquor. She had then
broken into her late residence and carefully
gathered the remnant of Jowker’s stock in her
apron. These she threw down a shaft. Then she
had fired Jowker’s store and performed a war-
dance round the blaze. After this she had filled
in the intervals of cursing the publican by
breaking his windows.
It took the united efforts of Jowker, the publi*
can, the “trap” and a pair of handcuffs, to
coerce Mrs. Jowker into taking a seat on the blue
painted waggonette, and when it departed, bound
for Bogalong lock-up, peace once more brooded
with outspread wings over the goat-haunted
village of Piligi.
■lf
The magistrate awarded Mrs. Jowker
“two ; -months’ hard.” When the time had
expirfed, Mrs. Jowker “footed it” to Piligi, full
of repentance; ami a desire to “ make it up ” with
Jowker, and live happily ever after. But
Jowker had left for parts unknown, and had left
no address for Mrs. Jowker, and in place of her
former home there was nothing but an aching
void.
She has not yet discovered where Mr. Jowker
abides, but is still hopeful. She roams the
country with great patience, and all the treasure
of a woman’s affection will be showered on the
absent Jowker whenever he chooses to let it
shower.
But I think Jowker will maintain a strict
neutrality.

One of the few industries which have
survived and prospered in N.S. Wales, despite
Freetrade and other disadvantages, is the great
piano and sewing machine business of Messrs.
Beale and Co., of Sydney, which is travelling
ahead with surprising rapidity. At Annandale,
in the immediate vicinity of the city, Messrs.
Beale have constructed a splendid factory for
the manufacture of sewing machine frames and
cabinets, and all the other ornamental wood and
iron work connected with their business. This
valuable industry suffers under the iniquitous
disadvantage of having to pay heavy duties upon
most of the raw materials it consumes. A duty
of 201 per cent, is exacted on the spirits of wine
largely used in polishing. Goods finished by the
foreigner may be imported absolutely free of duty,
whence it follows that such an enterprise, re-
munerating local talents and labour, is heavily
fined for doing so. In face of this stupid injustice,
an immense trade is doing in the decora-
tive parts of the business. The woods employed
are almost entirely Australian, and the timber of
the Australian forests, in the hands of the skilful
workmen employed, has been proved far superior
to the vaunted productions of the South American
and other foreign woodlands. Unfortunately its
is but little used—in this matter, as in many
others, distance lends enchantment to the view,
and the far-off article is valued merely by reason
of its remoteness. Vast quantities of timber, far
more beautiful than the costly material imported
from the further side of the Atlantic, are burnt to
make a bonfire for the ignorant selector, and but
for Messrs. Beale’s untiring enterprise much
more would meet the same fate. The
quantity used in their factory is enor-
mous, and a vast array of the finest machi-
nery enables them to turn out work which would
do credit to the best workmen of London and
Paris. Several of the most valuable machines are
of Messrs. Beale and Co.’s own construction, and
being used exclusively in their factory, they place it
even ahead of its foreign competitors. The firm has
now moved into new offices, above its central show-
rooms, 484 George-street, Sydney, and as the pre-
mises are fitted-up exclusively with Australian
woods, they furnish a fair sample of the
boundless resources of the forests of this con-
tinent, and the capacity of Messrs. Beale’s work-
shops. The Australian, in some senses, is a
modest individual. He imports his bishops, his
military men, his railway commissioners, and all
his high-priced public officials ; but when he takes
to importing his timber and his ready-made
cabinet-work—so long as Beale & Co. are above
gi-ound-his sanity Iv comes doubtful, for the
advantages of efficiency and beauty are all with
the local article.

“ The use of a good soap is certainly calculated
to preserve the skin in health, to maintain its
complexion and tone, and prevent its falling into
wrinkles . , . PEARS is a name engraven on

Transparent Soap is an article of the nicest and
most careful manufacture, and one of the most
refreshing and agreeable of balms for the skin.”

CORRESPONDENCE
‘John M‘R.” (Sydney): Hardly good enough
iO print, and yet too good to make us long to attend your
funeral “W. Kiniber”: We object to railway men
having to work on Sunday unless they get a day off
during the week to make up. If they' do it is all right.
Every' man has a right under present conditions to one
day’s rest in seven, or two if he can get them—which day
doesn’t matter a straw. But if you want to stop all kinds
of Sunday work you may as well sit down with a sickening
thud and give it up at once ...“ Robert P.F.”: Your
thrilling story about a man who washed his head in the
dish another man had been cleaning fowls in, and then
went mad before a looking-glass, is hereby declined....
“Frank W.S.”; Not one shred of originality in it
‘‘Jonah ’ (Derby): You were right to send that conun-
drum by letter. If you had delivered it personally you
would have been killed.. “W.R.”:Too slim... “An
Old Subscriber for many years ”: The Bulletin declines to
prop up consultations and “ totes,” because it is now plain
that mostof them are gros s swindles. It advocates making
the business a Government monopoly, and if you are such
an old subscriber you must have come across at least one
article on the subject. AVhy it is more anxious about
them than about racecourse betting is that the latter is
the way the rich man goes broke, while the former only
breaks that more numerous class which isn’t rich....

famous “ Song of Steam ” and spoilt in the borrowing
“ J.J.J.” (Sydney'): “Wearied” is a dirge lacking in
logic. When a man says he is sick of pleasure, why
doesn’t he go ring-barking? Why do you want “a refuge
in Death ?” Death may be twenty times wearier still for
a’l you know— “ Schneider’’(Maoriland): Send that pro-
fane yarn to Jos. Symes....“ A.H.C.” (Sydney): Don’t
you think the remark in the first versa is altogether 100
unprintable? We aren’t Zola or W. T. Stead.... “ J.T.C.”

print it—not even to be made Parkes or to become Dan.
O’Connor “ 5.J.8.”: We don’t suppose that the
A.M.P. directors are the sort of people “ to repair, at
the expense of the policy-holders, the shattered fortunes
of a pack of greedy traffickers in land.” “Subscriber”:
We write Pitman, but are told that Sloan-Duployan is as
good. It is certainly easier. However, if you write
Pit man well, you can go through the world as a shorthand-
writer. Nearly all the best reporters we know use Pitman.

goes ...“Ilia”: You cannot settle such matters off-hand
by reference to Scripture. The marriage question, to b»
imrued effectuallv. must be argued on nhvsiokurical
grounds. It is, in short, one which, under existing con-

is quite another thing. The blackfellow has surely a
moral right to live in his own country—even to the pre-
judice of the white man “T.P. & Co.” : We fail to see
any joke in a letter setting forth the willingness, of a

The melancholy event in the late Judge

Any Bill to regulate the management of
Building and Investment Societies in iV.S.W. will
be a sham and a snare unless it (1) fixes (as in
Victoria) the proportion of a Socit ty’s borrowings
on deposits and debentures to its paid,up capital
in cash; (2) does not compel the discrimination in
the periodical balance-sheets between realisable
and such non-realisable assets as flotation ex-
penses, good will, office-furniture and stationery;
(3) does not likewise enforce distinction between
capital nominally paid-up and actually paid-up;
and (4) does not make it a criminal act of the
directors and managers to include as an asset an
inflated and fictitious value unless by special
resolution of shareholders in general meeting
assembled.

Luckily for the poet, who rhymes “limit” with

Let this (just as silly and just as true) drop into
the worldffe W.P.B. alongside it : —
The Roumanian Royal Family appears to
have been suddenly broken up and done for by a
sweet young brunette,’ with two violet eyes and a
most delightful dimple. -This-destructive vision,
one Mdlle. Vacarescu, was pet maid-of-honour to
the Queen when the royal eldest son and heir—
the Tummy of those parts—fell violently in love
with her. The King swore a good deal over this
impolitic attachment (very likely he himself had a
sweet tooth for the maid-of-honour), but the
Queen, who ,is a giddy, romantic old thing, per-
suaded him-to give his consent to an “engage-
ment.” Thereupon the Ministry appealed to the
country to decide whether an Heir Apparent
ought to marry out of his royal “spere,” and the
country, being idiotic, said that sijfh a thing
wasn’t to be thought of. -Then/#.e yeigilhg
family commenced to cottapsg. First of®lH the
Heir Apparent, Prince Ferdinand, went away to
Austria, or somewhere, to hide his grief. Pre-
sently the Queen grew hysterical and departed for
a distant land, taking 1 the maid-of-honour with
her, and for the last two months off and on she
hasn’t been expected to live. Sometimes she gets
a little better, and then Miss Vacarescu isn’t
expected to live, or else they both recover fora
tune so that the broken-hearted Prince Ferdinand
can take a turn at Death’s door. The King bore
up against this domestic affliction as long as pos-
sible, but'last week he was making up his mind
(so the cable stated) to abdicate the Throne, and
if he goes the country will have to pawn the Crown
and shift for itself. All things considered, the
maxd-of-honour seems to deserve well of her
country.

One of the few sound Sydney Building

One hundred and one buggies and sixty
horsemen followed the funeral of Richard Cox, of
Marrar Station, Wagga Wagga. Cox came of an
athletic, devil-may-care family. The writer has
seen one of the brothers dismount to jump a three-
railed fence, whip in hand and a heavy ulster
streaming at his heels.
It is rumoured that John Horsfall has
joined or is about to join the N.Z. Loan and
Mercantile Agency as Australian adviser. This
if true, means the taking of a very large and
influential connection to the company; it also
means big profits, provided Mr. * Horsfall can
make as good investments for the N.Z. L.M. as
he did officially for Goldsborough & Co. and for
himself in his private capacity. It will be
remembered that the celebrated Rowan pamphlet
spoke of him as the “Riverina Plunger,” the idea
conveyed thereby to outsiders being that ,T.
H. was a dangerous and reckless speculator.
It will interest many people to know that every-
one of the speculations alluded to has proved a
marvellous success.
According to Meston, Joe Fleming, who
lately died at Ipswich, Q., was one of the prin-
cipals in the capture, in N.S.W., in ’33, of the
gang of bushrangers known as “ Dick’s Mob,” or
“ Dick the Devil’s Gang,’’ consisting of seven
whites and a black gin. The gang had played out
New England and crossed over to the Namoi
country, taking refuge in a hut-on Fleming’s cattle
station. Fleming, with one Freill and a stock-
man, started for the hut, round which the bush-
rangers had dug a deep trench. Captain Dick
had his gun pointed out between the slabs, and
1 reill drew a bead on it, sending “his bullet right
down the barrel ” —Meston’s own words—“ knock-
ing Master Dick down.” Dick surrendered in
sheer funk at such tall shooting and the whole
gang was captured,
Mr. Sheldon, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), is anxious
to have marked with pegs all Crown lands open to
selection. Which recalls a story current out West
of an old-time N.S.W. Irish land agent, now
dead. On his sans the best lands were selected,
occupants ever appeared. A visit to the
offices%ot£nspect always fetched the same yam :
“ That’s Father ’s lot; this is Mr. O-—’s lot •
that s Mick L s lotand so on. But a change
came. A new officer was sent up when the Lands
Office duties were separated from those of the
C.P.S. There was quite a rush to visit the new
officer, who was rather surprised to find men
selecting where already there were selectors, but,
turning to the books, on a wrinkle given him by a
would-be selector, he found they were all blanks.

They talk about a woman's sphere
As though it had a limit !
There’s not a place in earth or heaven ;
There’s not a task to mankind given ;
There’s not a blessing, or a woe ;
There’s not a whisper “ Yes ” or “ No ”;
There’s not a life or death or birth,
That lias a feather weigjjt of worth,
Without a woman in it.
They talk about a woman’s sphere, 4
As if a man were nothing here,
And women always win it ;
There's not a nook in grim Gehenna
That hasn’t got itadeep duenna;
There’s not a whisper “ Yes,” I trow,
That can be safely sworn a “No ” ;
There’s not a mischief haps from birth
Until man’s earth returns to earth—
Without a woman in it.


MERELY
THE TRUTH.
They have merit.
The fact is indisputable.
The proof lies in the free samples.
It is not enough to say they sometimes fail.
They are of human produce, and therefore fallible*
The real facts are —
Do they cure diseases of the blood and skin in the majority of in-
stances? Undoubtedly they do. ...
Do they undo the effect of a chill or congestion, by bringing about
normal conditions of health ? Yes, they loosen and disperse the congestion.
Do they permeate the blood aseptically, so that bacilli and gcims
cannot multiply and the growth of disease is checked ? Yes, they do.
Do they confer relief, assuage pain, and benefit the general health,
even when they do not cure 1 Invariably, yes.
Do they act as a natural healthy laxative, rendering them especially
valuable to women and children, and to men of sedentary habits of life or
business ? Yes, by tonic action only. ...» .
Do they free the inner skin pores and intricacies from taint, clearing
off eruptions and improving the complexion 1 They do.
Does their palatable taste and safety render them pre-eminently a
family medicine? Yes, for neither the mind nor stomach rebels against
them, and children like them.
Are they the best of all blood purifiers and the most valuable ot all
spring cleansing medicines ? Yes, they are.

Built Up
On Free Samples
The sales of Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets
afford the most convincing proof of their
merits, taken in conjunction with the methods
by which the sale has been built up.
For nearly two years past every person
who has written or applied for free samples of
Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets has been supplied
gratis and post free. Many tens of thousands
of persons have so applied, in accordance with
our invitation.
Practically every one of our advertisements
has contained an offer to supply free samples.

merit, must be attributed the success or failure
of the sales.
Have the sales grown?
Let the facts speak for themselves—
The sale for the year ending January 9,
1890, was 81,760 packets, proved by the pur-
chase of that number of Revenue Stamps.
The sale for the year ending January 9,
1891, was 412,000 packets, proved also by the
purchase of that number of Revenue Stamps,

The Shame bf Going Bach..
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When you’ve borne to inaka a fortune and yoft
haven’t made your salt,
And the reason of your falluro isn’t anybody’s
fault—•
When you haven’t got a billet, and the times are
Very slack,
There is nothing that can spur you like the shame
of going back;
Crawling home with empty pockets,
Going back hard-up,
Oh ! it’s then you learn the meaning of “ humilia-
tion’s cup.”
When the place and you are strangers and you
struggle all alone,
And you have a mighty longing for the town where
you are known;
When your clothes are very shabby and the
future’s very black,
There is nothing that can hurt you like the shame
of going back ;
Going home with empty pockets,
Crawling back hard-up;
Oh ! it's then you know the meaning of “ humilia-
tion’s cup.”
When we’ve fought the battle bravely and are
beaten to the wall,
’Tis the sneers of men, not conscience, that make
cowards of us all;
And the while you are returning, oh, your brain is
on the rack,
And your heart is in the shadow of the shame of
going back;
Going home with empty pockets,
Going back hard-up;
Then you know the bitter meaning of “ humilia-
ton’s cup.”
When a beaten man’s discovered with a bullet in
his brain
They post-mortem him, and try him, and they say
he was insane ;
But it very often happens that he’d lately “got
the sack,”
And his onward move was owing to the shame
of going back;
Going back with empty pockets,
Going home hard-up;
Oh ! it’s then you know the meaning of “humilia-
tion’s cup.”
Ah! my friend, you call it nonsense, and your
sneering lip is curl’d,
I can see that you have never worked your passage
thro’ the world ;
But when fortune rounds upon you and the rain is
on the track,
You will learn the bitter meaning of the shame of
going back;
Crawling home with empty packets,
Going home hard-up;
Oh, you’ll taste the bitter poison in “ humiliation’s
cup. ”

Pastor Grubb, the play-acting clergyman
says that the devil dees not wear horns and a tail'
but is more frequently attired in black clothes anti
a bell-topper. The Bulletin accepts the state-
ment cheerfully, as Grubb seems to be well up i n
devils and so on, and it isn’t. Besides, Grubb
wears black clothes and so he way be the devil, by
his own shoAving, and in that case he ought to bo
an authority, and should knoAV whether he has a
tail or not. We don’t wear black togs ourselves
so we obviously are net the person alluded to, and
as to the tail we have always been so busy getting
out the paper that rve haven’t had time to look
behind and see if it’s there or not.

Dear Bulletin, —Your story in last issue
about Jack M‘Lean and the Chinaman is almost
on all-fours rvith an occurrence 14 years ago of
which T. G. G. Dangar, then member for the
Nam 01, N.S. W., Avas the hero or victim. Dangar
visited Narrabri, aass tendered a banquet, and
presented Avith a purse of SOO so vs. Instead of
passing the gold into the bank ho put it in a
leather bag, andsAvungit under the buggy when
starting for Bingera, his idea being to buy some-
thing as a memento Avith the actual sovereigns.
When near B ngera the bag looked rather “flabby ”
and inspection shoAved that there Avere only ’a
couple of doze ii “ yellow bo}cs ” left. The sorrow-
"lg b'&'slator turned his horses’ heads, and some
distance back found a string rf Clioavs running
doAAn his tracks, but, as in M‘Lean’s case, “ No
savee.” The weight of the gold had caused a
small portion of the bag’s stitching to give way,
and so the soys, had dropped one by one along the
road. Dangar did not find even one of them. ' "

SHE PUT IT IN THE CUPBOARD.
What a weary thing it is to be ill, especially for a
long time. You are tired of advice, tired of try-
mg this, that, and the other, tired of fancying you
are a trifle better, tired of taking precautions
against getting worse. You are tired of pain, and
half believe the sooner you are under the ground
the better for you, and the more agreeable to your
friends.
Here’s a little story. A woman told it lately.
She says;
[Copy. ]
“I, Mary Jones, of 3, Gal ton-street, Great
Howard-street, Liverpool, declare as follows i
“I have suffered all my life from Weakness of
the stomach and sluggish liver. I was always
tired and languid, and often troubled with bilious
headache. -My "Ppetite was poor. I never li&d
desire for food, and what I did eat did not digest
properly. I had always a bad taste in my mouth,
and a slimy scum would cover my mouth and
teeth, and so bad was this that I was obliged to
rinse it away before eating. When I was in my
teens I was very weakly and would faint after
sitting down to my meals. I bad trembling at
the healt, with a heavy weight at the chest, pain
at my side, and a strange giddy feeling would
come over me. Winn out walking in the street I
used to have to stand and rest for fear of falling,
I was also so Weak that when going about my
work I often bad to sit d wn and rest. At times
I had a bad cough and pain in my lungs. I saw
doctor after doctor, and was under medical treat-
ment for more than twelve 3’ears. One doctor
said I was suffering from an enlargement on the
liver, another said I had heart disease, a third
said my lungs were congested and that I could not
recover. 1 hinking I was now in a consumption,
I went to a consumptive hospital and was under
treatment there for some time. The doctors, after
sounding my chest, told me I was in a decline,
and that my left lung vas congested. They gave
me rod bur oil and other medicines, but I got no
better.
“In July, 18C0, after a bad fainting, I became
so bad I bad to take to mj r bed, and was attended
by three, doctors for a month. The first doctor
who saw me said I could not recover. I had
intense pains in my stomach, and could get
nothing to i ass my bowels. Various means were
tried and found useless. I could take liquid food
only, and vas fast sinking, my case being con-
sidered hopeless by both the physician and the
nurse. At tins time it was that my husband
heard through Mr. Parry, the chemist in Great
Howard-street, of a medicine called Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and wo were presented
with a book which describe d a case just like mine
having been cured by it. My husband procured
a bottle of this medicine and I began taking it.
After a few doses I passed a motion ns black as
coal and experienced great relief, and shortly after
felt as if I wanted something to eat. When the
doctor called the next day he could see a marked
change in me and said, ‘Mrs. Jones, wo have
given you the right medicine at last.’ He thought
it was his last bottle that bad worked the change,
whereas the nurse had put the medicine in the
cupboard untouched. 1 went on with Mother
Sei gel's Syrup, and to the delight of my husband,
father, and mmo I never looked behind me All
the pain at the heart and chest gradually left me,
and in a fortnight I was strong enough to bo
removed to the seaside, and have ever since been
in good health.
“I never felt so well in my life as I do now.
All my friends consider the cure as a miraculous
one, and I wish others to know by what means
my life was saved. lam willing that Messrs. A.
.1. White, Limited, shall make whatever use they
Tn „,- ci ftt of this statement, Q nd I hereby
authorise them to do so.
‘Y.i.id tins 3rd April, 1891.
“ (Signed) Mrs. Mary Jones.”
There was nothing “miraculous” about this
lady's recovery, although it may have been, and
indeed it was, remarkable. But it was all along
the straight lines of nature. She had suffered all
her life from indigestion and dyspepsia, and her
other ailments arose from that, and that alone.
She could not digest her food, and the whole sys-
tem was perishing from tho poison in the stomach
and from lack of nutrition. Mother Siegel's
Syrup did its one work : it cleansed away the cor-
rupted matter and set the digestive organs (the
liver, stomach, and bowels) in natural operation,
and immediate improvement and final recovery
followed as necessary consequences.
Especially should the reader notice the close
resemblance between the symptoms of dyspepsia
and those of consumption, through which most
unhappy mistakes are constantly made. Never
conclude you have consumption until you are sure
it isn’t dyspepsia. The chances are that the
results will be the same as in Mrs. Jones’ case.

To 11. F. Kugelmann - , Esq.
Dear Sir, —IV,is is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. / consulted
moie than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine witho it it doing me the sli htest
good, but 1 bee unc worse every day, wasting away until
f oecain3 a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up Mood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectoratingevery day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
You told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
*Ed of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
rung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
uesnonal sk'" I am as well as ever.

Art and Vice-Royalty.
Neither Governor nor Lady Jersey bought any
pictures at the recent N.S. W. Art Society’s show.
We are rather surprised at this. You might have
given the poor artists a turn, Jersey. It wouldn't
have co t much—say a fiver or so. You could
have got a nice little picture for a fiver—and what
is a fiver to you? You must have saved that
amount by walking to Randwick races and going
in on the nod, instead of paying cab-fares and
gate-money. Or Lady Jersey ought to have made
a fiver out of the S.M. Herald or Telegraph for
those vei’ses about “Who were all these people?”
And think what a lot it would have meant to the
artists. Immediately it was known that the Earl
or Countess had bought a picture, all Potts Point
and Double Bay would have galloped their
carriage- horses down to the rooms, and bought the
loudest-coloured pictures they could see. Even
if the aides-de-camp had bought one or two it
would have given the show a great lift. This is a
land of grovel, cf boot licking grovel in high
places. And the retired tallow-merchants and
whisky-dealers, who constitute the aristocracy,
are ready enough to encourage art or anything
else with their cheque-books, if they get a notion
that it will find them favour in the eyes of
Government House. So long as they can talk to
their acquaintances about the “picture I bought
at the Art Society—it’s ’anging right alongside o’
the one Jersey bought,” then they are happy. It
would have made a vast difference to the artists,
and only a fiver to you, Gov. We wonder you
didn’t do it.
* * *
From the downy and artful Carington we
wouldn't have expected it. It was more within
his province to carry the crumpled-up remains of
a footballer home in his carriage, or to weep over
aheap of damaged bedding after a d rap r’s fire.
And from his aides-de-camp we would certainly
not have hoped anything. Liquor was their
speciality. So long as anyone would find the
liquor they would always provide the thirst.
Brains they didn’t have—only throats. But these
present aides are reputed to be rather a cultivated
lot of young men, with souls to some extent above
bottles. And yet even they have turned coldly
away from the efforts of the struggling children of
art. And from Lady Jersey, the refined, poetical,
kind-hearted Lady Jersey, the painter men hoped
so much. Toiling away in their garrets, living
mostly on credit and tinned fish, they slaved at their
pictures, hoping against hope. They knew that
unless some one showed the way the Sydney
plutocrats would never dream of buying pictures.
They knew that the same men who would refuse
to sit behind a carriage-horse wo;th less than a
hundred guineas, would complacently decorate the
walls of their houses with gaudy oleographs
supplied in bulk by the furniture-dealers.
They knew that in submitting their pictures to
these people, they were literally casting pearls
before swine. But with the Jersey Regime all
this was to change, and a taste for art was to
arise. So they opened their show with high
hopes, and Jersey came and ambled round the
room and said “Nice picture, ain’t it?” before
each one. And Lady Jersey admired and went
away : and Darling Point climbed heavily into its
carriages and rumbled away behind its hundred-
guinea horses, feeling quite sure that as the
Go’vment ’Ouse party hadn’t bought any pictures
it would be a risky and bizarre thing for them to
try. And the artist men were left lamenting.
Certain captious critics in the Victorian
Assembly are finding fault with the Anglican
Church for having leased (long ago) the Collins*
street frontage of St. James’ (Melb.) to a brewery.
One member—a humourless person with no sort of
turn for finance —said “he had heard ministers
preach against drinking whisky as a most dis-
graceful thing. At the same time it appeared in
this case that the Church of England let a portion
of land for brewery purposes. The land under
review had a grand brewery frontage to Collins-
street, but people had to go around into Little
Collins-street to discover the church.” Another
member insinuated that two churches, a back and
front tabernacle, ought to be there, because the
setting apart of so much of the original site for
the worship of Bacchus left many people in that
district “unprovided for. ’ Unprovided for, when
the larger institution turns out thousands of
barrels every year ! The Bulletin doesn’t often
whoop for an Established Church, but in this
instance we feel inclined to shout hallelujah as
loud as the “ General ” himself. It is the con-
junction of Beer with the Bible that has made
England great, and where the Church goes in for
bottling by deputy, as it were, any Australian
Parliament Is justified in singing “ God Save the
Queen.” Meanwhile we will sing :

“ I never had such a jolly time in my life
after the first shock was over,” said a genial-
looking edition of Dundreary grown milclewed,
a little while ago, reciting his experiences in Dar-
linghurst Prison, after escaping a ten years’sen-
tenee by a three years’ servitude. “Why,”
continued he, “I met the banker who used to
allow me my overdrafts, and the broker with
whom I had had the last razzle-dazzle, and then I
saw coining in that old ourang-outang who
used to be the palladium of our liberty. Why! I
was in the company of the best ‘ toffs,’ and we
soon assimilated, and we made a Mafia for our-
selves, protect! ve and aggressive if need be ! An
old codger, who said he used to be private secre-
tary to a Minister in another colony, was my
washerman for a quarter of tobacco weekly, and
a clergyman used to supply me with laughter and
satire upon ‘revealed ’ religion.”
On one day in March, 1822, at Hobart
Town, Yandemonia, the Rev. Dr. Knopwood
sentenced seven men to (550 lashes .among them,
in addition to a mere trifle of other punishments
aggregating l7f years at Macquarie Harbour, On
one March day in 1891, at Liverpool, England,
Mr. Justice Day ordered 10 criminals to receive
among them 12 floggings of 20 lashes each—in
addition to sentences totalling 29 years’ imprison-
ment. Problem : Find, from the equation of the
ten Jrc j* which British justice has been

Labour Disputes and the Way out—the Co-
operative Irrigation Colonies.
At a N.S.W. Circuit Court the only orator
of the Australian bar was present while a junior
was defending. During the case, the orator,
who says that he is a great linguist, handed
the junior a paper on which was written, “ Bcgo
bstha tshurd ” or words to that effect, and ex-
plained, “That is Dutch for ‘y° u are doing most
excellently.’” The junior was ungratefully scorn
ful, but said nothing. After the address for the
defence the senior handed up another paper
inscribed, “ Caraballo spraken gibberish,” or some-
thing that looked like that, and said, “That is
Peruvian for ‘you have made.a wonderful speech. ’”
The junior scribbled the name of the orator on
another scrap of paper and handed it to him with
the remark, “That is English for blankety blank
old fool.” And since then they never have been
such friends as of yore.
W. Hutchison, M.H.R., of Maoriland, is
going to move in the Wellington Parliament that
his country should start afresh with a new name,
and forget the dismal title which it borrowed from
the frog-infested swalnps of Zeeland. Hutchison
is just a little too subsequent. The Bulletin has
already changed the name of his country, to
Maoriland (M.L. for short), and he is arguing
about an accomplished fact, and valiantly whack-
ing a corpse. Moreover, from the letter which
Hutchison writes to the Evening Post, he
evidently thinks that the original Zeeland was
part of Denmark, and he wails in an inconsequent
way about the Baltic Sea* Such ignorance is dis
gusting.
You can obtain from B. Mountcastle & Sons, of
Albert-street, Brisbane, goods of a similar class to

BEER AND SPIRIT.
Man wants but little here below,
He wants but little here
Of many other things, although
He wants a lot of beer.
And when ’tis brewed on holy ground
From simple hops and malt
(The mixture being tickled round
With little sticks of salt)
For better tipple far and wide
A man would have to searcli ;
That frothy brew seems sanctified
And issued by the Church.
As well for body as for soul
The Church must have a care,
And liquor strengthens, on the whole,
A sinner more than prayer.
The shepherd likes denouncing drink,
We’ve always understood,
But still admits, with pious wink,
A drop or two is good,
No bigot railers shall prevent
The servants of the Lord
From letting brewers pay the rent
Which bishops can’t afford.
When bishops hold two plots of sod
They dedicate, no fear,
The cheaper to Almighty God,
The better one to beer.
So, if a brewery you find
When Collins-street you search, *
Why, raise your hat, for close behind
There stands a shabby church.
Betwixt those buildings you may choose
Your flagging heart to cheer :
For one the Holy Spirit brews,
The other —Holy Beer.
