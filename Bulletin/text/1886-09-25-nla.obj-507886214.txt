Bon Voyage!
Some days ago, just before the Consul at
Sydney for the United States of America left
our shores on a visit to his native land, a num-
ber of prominent citizens assembled at a bril-
liant banquette wish him Gon-speedand desire
his quick return, bringing with him an im-
proved appetite and a higher official rank.
As a rule it is unwise to attach much sig-
nificance to speeches delivered at such
gatherings. They are mostly of the florid
type of oratory and in not a few cases break
through the thin partition dividing real feel-
ing from unreal fustian. But at the late
banquet representative men alone spoke-
men generally recognised as the exponents
of colonial thought and culture—men of light
and leading. Their opinions, calmly pon-
dered, calmly expressed, passed —or were
intended to pass—over the heads of their
audience and reached the public. Let us
hearken.
* * *
To begin with Sir James Martin :
“ I came here,” said he, “to express my sincere
and heartfelt desire for the closer union between the
British Empire and those great confederate States
of America. . . . Europe is armed to the
teeth. It is therefore of the utmost importance
that these two great communities, neither of them
desirous of conquest . . . both of them so
powerful—together irresistible—should be bound
together in the closest ties. . . The English
character of the United States still stands as good
as when they were the 13 colonies of America.
» . . There is the community of race and the
community of blood. . . . There was a time
When it was said that the high offices of the
United States did not fall to the lot of the most
eminent men. ... In the list of Presidents
there were men who could not be said to bo
eminent. . . . The time is coming when , .
a tie of steel will hind them [England and
America]. I propose ‘ The President of the United
States, who, next to the Queen of England, is
Worthy of the highest honour from the lips ol
Englishmen.’ ”
Let us try and examine these excerpta and
the lessons sought to be inculcated by them.
Let us turn on them, not the rush-light of
harrow patriotism, but the bull’s-eye of com-
mon-sense cosmopolitanism.
* * *
Over a hundred years ago, when the
Obstinacy and savagery of our present Mon-
arch’s grandfather convinced the sturdy
Tom Paine that in independence alone lay
America’s chance of happiness, the convic-
tion was accompanied with the assurance
that in the struggle for existence a mixed
breed will leave a pure one hopelessly be-
hind. So the States, when they shook them-
selves free of Guelphs, Hessians, and
Indians, opened wide their doors to the down-
trodden of all lands. Germans, vho had
Smarted under the canes of Frederick’s
Corporals; Frenchmen, who had struggled
Under Bourbon rods ; Irishmen, half-flayed
by Lake’s cat-o’-nine-tails ; Italians, Poles,
Scandinavians, all turned to the West. To
call the Americans a “ British people ” is on
a par with calling the inhabitants of the
French-speaking Swiss Cantons, “Gauls.” A
good deal of innocent enjoyment is some-
times derived from this tendency to claim as
cousins those who happen to speak our
tongue. When the Brooklyn and Bowery
legionaries executed a masterly movement
at Bull’s Run, leaving their commissariat
and cannon behind, London journals made
things pleasant by addressing them as
“ Yankee pedlars ” who would never be got
to face Southern chivalry. When Grant’s
doggedness opened the way to Richmond,
British broadsheets referred to his troops as
“Anglo-American eagles.”
When prominent men both here and at
home take credit for the non-aggressive
characteristics of our race, the Russian lady’s
delicate way of putting the case to the Eng-
lish ambassador occurs —“ for people who
have no appetite it must be confessed you
English have made a remarkably good meal.”
Considering how the British Empire has
grown and is growing, the word “aggression,”
used as a term of reproach, is one whic
English statesmen should studiously avoic
A country just capable of occupying a circ
with a 200-mile radius, which has succeedec
in securing one-sixth of the earth’s dry lan
and one-fifth of the earth’s inhabitants, mus
be allowed to have made a hearty meal. J
is not strange that with such a dinner
digest, her appetite should show signs of fai
ing. Yet some doctors would assist he
powers of assimilation by prescribing
dessert of Pacific islands. Sir James Marti
thinks that a close union between the Britis
Monarchy and the American Republic woulc
be able to impose peace on mankind. At
London entertainment the other day
ci-devant Radical, Sir Graham Berry, wen
further. According to the Victorian Ageni
General, war was to be prevented by a gooc
understanding between Britain and he
colonies. When the nations learned tha
perfect agreement existed between London
and Melbourne, the “ Marseillaise ” woult
cease, the “Rhine Watch” be heard n
more. But even if the frankest cordiality
accompanied with the firmest alliance spran
up between the Capitol and St. Stephen's
the effect upon European Cabinets would b
less than that caused by the movement of an
extra regiment of Zouaves towards th
Vosges or an additional troop of Cossack
towards the Danube. On her own grounc
America is impregnable. With this she i
content. Non-intervention in disturbance
outside her own territory is her traditiona
policy. For her to play a leading part in
European affairs would not only be opposec
alike to interest and common-sense bu
would necessitate the creation of a vas
standing army with all its attendant evils
The citizen who in Philadelphia or Washing
ton stood up to advocate such a course woulc
find himself the object not so much of sus
picion as of laughter.
* * *
Perhaps the oddest thing about this
bizarre desire for an offensive and defensive
alliance of the scattered communities speak
ing the Saxon tongue is the fact of its being
almost entirely the growth of Australiai
Conservatism. No English or Americar
public man hazards his reputation for sounc
judgment by dallying with the wild sugges-
tion. It is not practicable—it is not meet.
Even if it were both, there are circumstances
connected with the thoughts, feelings, anc
actions of the two countries which woulc
render such a union powerless for good.
Towards America, dependent or independent,
British “ society ” has always occupied the
place of a harsh step-mother. There is no
necessity to go with Sir James back to the
days of Washington or the war of 1812—to
examine again that item for ‘ ‘ scalping-
knives ” supplied by good King George to
his “loyal” Indians, or read with disgust of the
stupid Vandalism which found vent in des-
troying the Capitol—for illustrations of this
churlishness. Only the other day when
America was battling and bleeding in defence
of a great principle, derision, not sympathy,
came to her over the sea from Conservative
and Aristocratic Britain. It would not be
too much to say that, with a few honorable
exceptions here and there, passionate sup-
plications went daily up from cultivated
English homes beseeching Heaven to look
kindly on the efforts of Davis and Lee —to
assist them in driving the wedge of Secession
through the heart of the Union. From Can-
terbury’s Archbishop in his palace to the
poor curate struggling with the filth and
foulmouthedness of “Seven Dials” as-
cended prayers for the success of the worst
cause for which brave men ever laid down
their lives. The “society” that snivelled
over “Uncle Tom” sneered and shot out
the tongue on reading how the ranks of those
who had sworn to wipe out LEGREB-ism
staggered, tattered and torn, from the guns
of Stonewall Jackson.
* * *
The following is, perhaps, a fair sample of
America’s attitude on this subject of rap-
prochement ;
“You Australians are a peculiar people. You
are afraid to go alone—to even entertain the idea
of having to do it ultimately. Your highest
aspirations do not get beyond clinging to your
mother’s apron-strings or crowing with childish
glee over the pinchbeck decorations contemp-
tuously thrown you by distant officials to whom
you and your wives supply food for mirthful
bewilderment. With a land whose climate, soil,
and size point to a prosperous future, you shiver
at the word ‘ Independence ’ and tremble when a
Foreign Power seizes a few fever-stricken rocks
separated from you by 20 degrees of longitude.
And now you want us, who are at peace with all
men, to turn our country into a drill-ground, our
artisans and ploughmen into armed idlers, to
espouse your and your mother’s quarrels. Really,
gentlemen, your modesty is most attractive.”
* * *
Sir James Martin’s statement that all
the American Presidents were not eminent
men, but that many were merely “ respect-
able ”is a little carious. It is not difficult
to discover in it a mild undertone of com-
miseration—-a friendly suggestion of the in-
feriority of Republicanism, so far at least as
success in choosing a First Magistrate is
concerned. No form of Government has
ever succeeded or ever will succeed in
always choosing the worthiest man to place
at the head of affairs. Republicanism
does not pretend to invariable success in
lifting the ablest to the top. It contents
itself with saying, ‘ ‘ Follow my plan and if
you do not always get talent you will at least
get respectability.” But. there is another
method in vogue among men for obtaining
a ruler—a method which seldom succeeds in
securing either talent or repute. It is th
of heredity. Whether this absurd syste
is viewed from an a priori standpoint or
brought before the bar of universal ex
perience, the verdict is the same—most r
mischievous, always stupid. If proof wer
wanting of the slow progress of mankind i;
would be found in the prevalence of king
after a trial extending over ages. In human
annals the longest and bloodiest pages deta:
the vices of hereditary monarchs—th
dreariest their virtues. There is somethin
so exquisitely droll in a man’s governin
because his father did, that, but for it
lamentable consequences, it would provok
mirth rather than alarm. Yet, in mos;
countries, bland, high-salaried Judges, patr
cians, and priests, discover in it a marvellou
adaptation of means to ends—a nice con
sonance with the laws of Nature and o:’
God. “ Whenever,” said a late philosophe
with brusque candour, “ I hear of a
‘ eternal truth,’ I think of an ‘ infernal lie.’
This is the feeling that comes over one brec
in the creed of Democracy on reading of th
parallelism blasphemously sought to b
established between the rule of the Create
and one of His creatures. When we hear o: :
Spain’s infant King squatting on a golde
salver and being carried naked, bawling, mew
ing, and puking through a gorgeous hall tha;
white-haired statesmen and soldier’s migh;
recognise their heaven-sent master, we fee
that—it is time to return to Sir Jamb
Martin.
* * *
“ Many of the American Presidents wer
respectable, but not eminent men. ” With th
exception of the ten years from 1649 to 1659
England since the conquest has enjoycc
hereditary rulers for over eight centuries
But, omitting the present Monarch, there i
scarcely to be found one who was not a mur
derer, a blackguard, a trull, or a fool. Thi
may sound harsh, but the evidence proving
its truth cannot be gainsaid. From the
time the canaille of Europe garotted Englanc
under the First William to that when the
Fourth of the name bawled lewd stories
across his own table to the amazement of the
assembled ambassadors, the hereditary prin
ciple has given us a succession of magistrates
whose names in most cases would fitly heac
the rosters of the villainy of their time
It would be tedious and unprofitable to go
through the whole list of royal rascals, noi
would we touch the unsavoury subject at al
but for Sir James Martin’s covert condem-
nation of the system where ‘ ‘ the high offices
did not fall to the lot of the most eminent
men.” But a few examples are necessary.
Beginning, then, with the present dynasty,
George I. burnt the wills of his wife anc
father-in-law and so possessed himself of
property intended for others. He kept his
wife in prison for 32 years and was with
difficulty prevented from putting his son to
death for visiting her there. He kept a
seraglio with two eunuchs— Mustapha and
Mahomet —to mind it. His favourite mis-
tresses, Kilmansegge and Schulenberg—
the latter known as the “Giraffe,” the
former as the “ Elephant’’—were made
Countess of Darlington and Duchess of
Kendal. They were the ugliest women of
their age, but, as Chesterfield said of his
Sovereign, “no woman came amiss to him if
she were only very willing and very fat.”
George 11. destroyed his father’s will. The
morals of his court were indescribable. His
Queen filled towards him the dual offices of
wife and procuress. Says Macaulay : “ Not
one magnanimous or humane action Is re-
corded of him.” He consoled his dying wife
with ‘ 1 j’aurai des mattresses ,” when she ad-
vised him to marry again. George 111.
was unfortunately a lunatic during only part
of his reign. Had he been mad during the
whole of it, the country might have been
saved from humiliation and expense. He
spent £140,000,000 in vainly trying to
coerce America, and over £1,000,000,000
in bringing the Bourbons to Paris,
from which they were hunted 15 years
afterwards. He was a bigamist—a fact
which his promising son threatened to
make known if not supplied with money.
He applied to the Czarina of Russia for 20,000
troops to turn loose on the Americans, and,
being refused, secured as allies 17,000 Ger-
mans together with the Creek and Cherokee
Indians. During his madness, his sons
amused themselves by tying his leg to a bed-
post and playing at “bait the bear”
with the Defender of the Faith. George
IV. tried bigamy like his father, and used the
secret-service money to prove that his second
wife, Caroline of Brunswick, was an adul-
teress. As a liar and a roue he could hold his
own against all-comers, and was not above
lending himself to a racing swindle. Of Wil-
liam IV., Greville says, “ He always con-
tinued to be something of a blackguard and
something more of a buffoon.” When the
President of the Royal Academy showed
him the portrait of Admiral Napier, the
King courteously remarked:—“Captain
Napier may be damned, sir ! and you may
be damned, sir ! and if the Queen was not
here, sir, I would kick you down stairs, sir.”
How thankful we should be to live under a
system which, unlike the American, secures
the most eminent men for the highest
The Progress of New South Wales.
Ihe alarming indications of retrogressio
which the recently-pubKshed N.S.W. official st
tistics for 1885 disclose, have, as is usual in sue
cases, been studiously ignored hy the Sydney dai
press. As we regard it as the first duty of t]
Press to warn the public of dangers and expo
continuing evils, rather than to congratulate it
unreal prosperity, we will, at the risk of bein
somewhat unentertaining, notice a few facts cullec
from the statistics referred to.
* * *
The rapidly-widening difference which ha
for the last few years existed between the impor
and the exports has very nmch increased durin
1885. In 1883 it was £1,071,139, in 1884 it wa
£4,575,479, and in 1885 it amounted to nearly seve
millions (£6,923,451). This has not only been du
to an increase in the imports but also to a stead
decline in the exports. Not only have foreign gooc
been forcing N.S. W. out of hor own market to an in
creased extent, but she is gradually losing th
trade of the few outside markets to whic
she has had access, although from th
resumes of the 1885 statistics with whic
the public have been favoured it would seem tha
New South Wales continues on that uninterrupted
career of phenomenal prosperity of which we hav
heard so much. Yet, as a matter of fact, nothin
could more clearly demonstrate the fallacy of th
policy which has been pursued than d
these statistics; they prove that not eve
the promiscuous circulation of cnormou
sinus of borrowed money has been able t
check the decline of trade and prevent th
rapid retrogression to be seen in every branch o
industry. With extensive lines of railway unde
construction, which can never pay, with a loss o:
nearly a million annually on the loan interest ae
count, with a rapidly increasing deficit of nearly tw
millions, and with a land law which has had what
ever good there was in it squelched by gross mis
management, the colony is asked to look forwarc
to the cheerful prospect of inviting the world t
come, at the colonial expense, and see how success
fully we have neutralised our magnificent re
sources, and how prodigally we have expended
other people’s money and fostered the industries
of other countries.
* * *
The falling-off to which we have alludec
has been in most instances too marked and con
tinuous to admit of Mr. Colonial-Secretary Dibbs
favourite device of saddling Providence with
Ministerial improvidence. With hardly an ex
ception the export of colonial productions has
been steadily falling off for the last five years.
Most of the important trades and manufactures
have also either declined or remained practically
at a standstill. The tonnage of vessels inwards
has decreased nearly a quarter of a million, and
the tonnage outward nearly half a million ; the
number of vessels built has fallen from 101
to 65 in 12 months, and the Customs figures
have been practically stationary. Turning to the
statistics referring to mills and manufactories, we
find that the refined sugar manufactured in the
colony decreased from 514,400 cwt. in 1880 to
380,550 in 1885 ; tobacco, from 24,654 cwt. in 1871
to 21,474 in 1885 ; soap and candles show a still
larger falling off; 45 per cent, of the woollen manu-
factories at work in 1879 have been abandoned,
the production standing at 187,750yd5. in 1885 as
against 330,037yd5. in 1878. The number of
stone-dressing works, paper-mills, glass-making
and staining works, tile works, and lime-kilns was
in each case twice as great in 1876 as in 1885 ;
while, during the same period, the establishments
in other important trades —principally boot manu-
factories, jam manufactories, tanneries, ship and
boat-building yards, smelting works, and fell-
mongeries—have decreased to a greater or less
extent. This falling off has spread over 10 years,
during which time the population has increased
from 629,776 to a million, and the public debt has
quadrupled itself,
* * *
These figures, it will be seen, embrace a
period too long to admit of the customary plea of
meteorological misfortunes. They indicate very
clearly, to all who will permit themselves to be
convinced, that some radical error lies at the root
of the whole system of governmental and fiscal
policy. They ought to finally convince those
gentlemen (who, with our customary courtesy, we
will call the statesmen of the colony) who have
charge of the public concerns that the history, the
prejudices, and the mistakes of older and dif-
ferently-circumstanced lands are not necessarily
precedents which it devolves upon us to adhere to
at any cost. There is a very great opening for a
few men of independence and ability to get loose
amongst our one-horse road and bridge politicians
and rub into them the very necessary lesson that
the great nations have been those which have made
precedents instead of being governed by them. It
is not very reassuring to the people of N.S.W.
-—who must have been feeling the brunt of the
hard times and foolish policy which these returns
reveal to know that the power of remedy lay un-
fortunately in the hands of those remarkable
examples of general, all-round incapacity who
collectively form the Parliament, and who, with
characteristic imbecility, throw away every oppor-
tunity of reform and spend the time—as, indeed,
they have spent the last 12 months—in feeble
quarrels and useless blather, unrelieved by one
single useful measure, but occasionally varied
by a very poor and badly-conducted exhibition of
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Justice on the Sea.
The philosophic maxim, “Happy is the nation
which has no history,” is sadly in want of revision
in the nineteenth century. Happy rather is the
nation which writes its own history and has no
carping critics to tell how its “glory” is only
atrocious murder, and its so-called justice a
system of hideous brutality. The story of Euro-
pean justice as it is dealt out to offending islanders
in the Pacific has as yet been written only on one
side of the page. Hardly a month passes without
news of some burly ironclad having visited one or
more of the South Sea groups, and blown a dozen
defenceless villages and a few score of naked
savages into atoms, in retaliation for a reported
murder or some other piece of wickedness, but
unhappily W’e only hear the white man’s version
of these tales of blood and cruelty, and the out-
rages by which he commenced the strife are buried
in oblivion. As a rule too, the British Govern-
ment, in common with many other “civilized”
administrations, boasts complacently of what the
steel-clad destroyers have accomplished, but in
the case of H.M.S. Diamond an exception has
been made. Her record was too atrocious even
for them to publish, and in the Commons, a week
ago, the First Lord of the Admiralty positively
refused to produce the report of her cruise. The
report which the islanders could give can easily
toe imagined, but unhappily they are destitute of


all means of publishing their wrongs and suffer-
ings. In point of civilisation they are far behind
the ancient Aztecs, who used to sketch a wild-
eyed cat on the end of a brick, and could thereby
convey a whole emotion to the receiver of the
hard-baked manuscript; they are even more
ignorant than the dusky tribes of Central Africa
who can record a solemn agreement by cutting
down a tree, or by planting both feet in a tub of
flour, and who can spread valuable information
by splitting a dog down the back, and sending the
decaying dogument from village to village. But
if the tribes of the South Seas had made but one
step in the march of progress—if they knew only
the rudiments of the art of writing as they were
known in Egypt six thousand years ago, they
would probably ere this have sent to all the Aus-
tralian capitals a dead fish with a cockroach tied
to its tail or some corresponding symbol which
would have told a harrowing story of suffering
and oppression. They are startled on some sum-
mer morning by the arrival of a strange schooner,
and are presently visited by a crowd of short fat
men who smoke long pipes, and growl out “ Mein
Gott! ” as they plod heavily about the shore.
Those pilgrims are hospitably entertained, and
when they leave they carry off the wives or sisters
or sweethearts of half-a-dozen natives, and when
the latter attempt to protest they are shrivelled
up by lightning from the tubes that the visitors
carry in their hands. A few weeks later another
party arrive who seem to be the very duplicates
of the first, and the islander, little versed in
philology or oaths, fails to note that the latter say
“Goddam” in place of “Mein Gott,” and that
one crew was commanded by a murderer
with a broken nose and the other by a
ruftlan with a bruised eye. The latter ar-
rivals may not perhaps conduct themselves
as badly as their predecessors, but they seldom
fail to keep up the reputation the white man has
acquired for evil-doing, and the natives, with
their old wrongs to avenge, make a dinner off
them and get chronic indigestion as the result
of devouring wretches who are not fit either to be
oaten in this world or to be sent to the next.
Then probably 12 months elapse until a cruiser can
be spared to wipe off arrears of slaughter, and
finally the armour-plated murderer as likely as
not goes to the wrong island and blows to pieces
half of an unoffending tribe who never even
heard of the original murder. These bloodthirsty
visitations are made on the reports of white men
only. No one enquires by what vile atrocities the
complainants first roused the natives to madness,
nor even takes the trouble to ascertain whether
the seamen did not murder each other in mutiny,
or as the result of a drunken brawl, and then hide
their crimes by laying the blame on the dusky
savages of the islands, and, though in many cases
the accusers are men whose oaths would hardly be
accepted in open court, their bare assertion is re-
garded as sufficient justification for the slaughter
of a hundred natives or as many more as can be
found. British justice in the South Seas is one of
the vilest among the many vile cruelties which
stain the name of this sin-cursed Empire, and it
would be well if philanthropists and others of that
ilk, when they have finished sympathising with
the victims of other nations’ outrages in the re-
mote spots of the earth, would spare a little
attention to the sufferings of this dying race in
the Pacific. All Britain rings with the tale when
a Jew is roasted whole to make a Russian holiday
or a Bulgarian is cut in two by a Turkish scimi-
tar, or an Irishman with one sort of flag raises a
yell of indignation because he‘is not allowed to
murder another Irishman with another sort of flag,
or an obtrusive missionary is beheaded for poking
his nose into the concerns of an African king,
and perhaps on the principle that every dog
has his day a voice will yet be raised in the
British Parliament to stop this long s series of
horrors in the far Pacific.
A G-enerous Journal.
It is located at Market-street, Sydney, and the
generosity takes the form of “Encouragement to
Australian writers.” There is positively no de-
ception : specie to the amount of £75 is to be given
away in five prizes, and to avoid the suspicion of
favouritism the readers of the Journal are to be
the judges. All tales, save those which “are so
Weakly or defectively written as not to be worth
publication ” (even in the Journal !), will be
printed, and the fractions of £75 paid to the suc-
cessful competitors after balloting has taken place.
What the unsuccessful competitors will get is not
definitely, or even indefinitely, stated; we are
therefore unable to assert authoritatively whether,
to use a common phrase, the smell of the prize
Will be their share, or whether the proprietors of
the paper will pay for the published “ copy ” with
tha,t princely munificence which has ever charac-
terised our Market-street contemporary. If un-
successful competitors are to be paid, we offer
them our congratulations ; if on the contrary they
are not to receive anything, we —ah, well, we
congratulate the Town and Country Journal.
We felicitate the latter in any case ; any
effort to elevate the character of Australian
literature is worthy of all admiration, and perusal
of the News or Journal any week is sufficient to
prove what a huge task awaits the willing re-
former. Even in the announcement of the prize
competition, the sentence, “ Each tale must be
signed by a nom de plume,” occurs. We have
never seen a no.n de plume signing anything—in
fact, we have hitherto believed the virtues of a
nom deplume to be of an exclusively passive nature,
and therefore regard the quoted sentence as a
very inferior sample of Australian or any other
sort of literature. It is a useful condition of the
competition which directs that the stories shall
deal with Australian subjects ; these latter should
not be difficult to discover, and we sincerely hope
that gratitude may inspire some gifted writer to
select for his theme, “A Generous Journal—News-
paper Enterprise in Sydney,” making special men-
tion of the price per column he expects to get in
case the MS. is published but does not receive a
prize.
“An Alien and a Pauper.”
You know how many and many a one has been
buried with that epitaph, how swagmen without
end, aliens and paupers from the time they set
foot on these hospitable Australian shores, have
died and been buried, or have rotted in the thick
scrub, or dessicated on the plains. Nothing re-
markable about that. “ D him, he might
have done it in another place I” says the' super.,
when told that there is a “stiff un” in the tra-
vellers’ hut or the horse-paddock. But this was a
black and he died at Narrabri, and, says the
Sydney Morning Herald of the 17th inst., “he
was buried by the blacks in that portion
of the cemetery devoted to aliens and
paupers.” No other place for him. Natural heir,
doubtless, to a goodly tract of the fat plain land
which rolls away westward from Narrabri, but
robbed of it all, houseless, homeless, debauched,
diseased, dead in his own land, and buried in
an alien’s and pauper’s grave. So dies out that
long-drawn wail of agony whose crescendo, could
it have reached, would have shocked and thrilled
the world. How easily from the alien’s and
pauper’s grave at Narrabri can we reach back,
stage by stage, through the chapter of horrors :
see that hunt in the Gulf country when all the
stations turned out to avenge a horrid crime, and
shot and stabbed through a three weeks’ butchery
without mercy or remorse; to that “bad” New
South Wales murder, when six convicts
“supposed to have been instigated by superior
persons,” surrounded on horseback a camp of
36 blacks and took them out and butchered them
one by one ; to gins ravished and boys stolen now
within this present decade throughout the north
and west; to the tales —or rather the facts —re-
corded by so eminent an authority as Doctor
West, of the “Tasmanian War”; of the stock-
men who used to persuade gins to climb trees and
then make targets of them, betting plugs of
tobacco as to which came down first; of old
Jimmy Scott, who, having shot the black who
stole his flour, strung his bleeding head around
the gin’s neck and drove her before him as a prize ;
of Harrison, who kept 16 women in a condition
of slavery on an island in the Straits “ whom he
used to flog regularly with military severity, and
some of whom he put to death of fore-finger
joints used as “ bacca’’-stoppers ; of —shall we
turn, for relief’s sake, to the “ shocking cruelties,”
of Cortez and Pizarro, to tales of the Spanish
Main, being sickened with horror by any fair
recital of Australian truths—or bury the whole lot
in the alien’s and pauper’s grave, and try to believe
that, while there is a God who judges. Ho will
overlook our sins and enable us to forget them ?
Carington on the Stump.
He went to Albury last week, and attended only
by his aide-de-camp. It would appear also that
he had forgotten his bag, or otherwise the private
secretary had been very busy with lawn-tennis
and Mr. Dallky too sick to be bothered, for he
spoke for himself, and what did he say ? Oh,
worshippers of the golden calf and the Deputy
Crownship, take up the full and ample record sup-
plied by the daily press and tell us what you
think of it. He was going into a new country, he
halted at Wagga, the old historic town, the
cradle of some of the most thrilling tragedy
and broadest comedy of Australian life ; he
went down to Albury, old Hercules Robin-
son’s federal city, and he spoke in both
places. Nay, he did not speak at Wagga, but said
he would get a reply written to their address when
he reached Sydney. At Albury he dined and
drank and was toasted, and so perforce replied.
And what did he say ? What evidence did he give
of thought, knowledge, appreciation, perception of
his surroundings? Why, if little Tommy Tucker
had not sung better for his supper than Lord
Carington talked for his dinner at Albury, he
would certainly have gone to bed hungry. And
we pay £7OOO a year to his lordship, and we got
men like old Sir Herky and Sir John Young at
the same price and heroes like old Arthur Phillip
and John Hunter at about one-third of it. They
of course were not so nice as “ Carry.” There is a
leaven about the existing arrangement which in
certain quarters is doing good and necessary
work. The tone of Sydney society needs elevat-
ing, all the “upper classes” require toning and tun-
ing to make them accord with the “ high life ” of
“ the Empire*” And “ Carry ” does that sort of
thing admirably ; but, oh ! all you workers of the
l a nd—bricklayers sweating on the walls, farmers
toiling in the furrows, tankmakers, shearers,
tradesmen of the bush and the town—does it seem
a pleasant thing to you that £7OOO a year should
be taken from the taxes you pay to make Potts
and Darling Pointers nice ? His Excellency set-
ting himself to perform that task, however, is the
last man in the world to be envied. We don’t
envy him, but we don’t like paying him—at least
for that sort of work.
A Betrayed Religion.
“The Rev. Ward Beecher is preaching sermons at £lOO a
time. I ancy a clergyman asking that sum before consenting
to point the road to heaven, while the first ploughboy you
meet in a country lane will point the road to the nearest
church for nothing, and touch his hat into the bargain
English paper.
“‘Ah, what a horrible betrayal of Christ has
been the history of churches and of religious
sects!’ said Henry Ward Beecher the other day
in London. Churches and sects do not think so.
1 hey, or rather their ministers, are always pro-
claiming what immense good they effect, and con-
stantly cadge for funds to carry on their devout
efforts. Christ was an ideal democrat. He
dressed in mean garments, and possessed an empty
purse. How like Him are our State-paid snobs,
with their outrageous incomes and emoluments,
their luxury and idleness, and their avowed
struggle to maintain all manners of abuses in-
jurious to the people !” The above is from Rey-
nolds Newspaper, and reminds us somehow or
other, that in the S. M. Herald of Saturday last
there appeared a sub-leader earnestly contending
that as it was desirable that the vacant Anglican
Bishopric of Bathurst, New South Wales, should be
filled by a good man,” it would be well to provide
a salary in excess of that enioyed by the late
Bishop, viz., £BOO per annum and quarters. Time
was when the best Christian clergymen were
those who worked for the least money. But we
have changed that now. The ponderous Sydney
organ of latter-day Pharisaism tells us that “a
bishop is not an ordinary clergyman,” and that it
is not possible for any gaitered representative of
the le bon sans culotte— the Carpenter’s Son, the
meek and lowly Nazarene, who knew not where
to lay His head —to “take his proper place in
society ” and “ properly educate his children ” on
£BOO a year. We agree with the Herald. So
long as the average Bishop continues to show that
he has in his breast no more of the true Christian
spirit of self-sacrifice than is possessed by
the average pagan member of Parliament—so long
as the magnates of the alleged Christian clergy of
England continue to turn up their aristocratic
noses at, say, the bishopric of Melbourne because
it is only worth £36 a week in hard cash—so long
shall we concur in the opinion that £BOO a year, or
£l6 weekly, is but a poor salary to offer to a
bishop. In these days, no bishop can be so holy
on £BOO a year as on £lOOO, and as the only recom-
mendation and use of a bishop is his presumed
piety, the more he has of it the better. And the
Scripture should be altered accordingly so as to
read ; “A bishop shall be the husband of one wife
and the proprietor of, say, eight thousand a year
and perks.”
Pharisees and Larrikins.
“The Mount Rennie outrage”was the text of
several in Sydney churches on Sun-
day last. The newspapers have made much of this
subject, dilating upon the most meagre evidence
in a hyper-sensational way : it was only in accord
with usual custom that the clergy should follow in
the same line. Such hasty comment and con-
demnation was to be expected from evening news-
papers with a circulation (in Woolloomooloo and
bussex-street) ten thousand greater than any other
paper, or from the philo-Ghinese Daily Tei.e-
graph, but justice and decency would seem to re-
quire that the pulpits should have reserved judg-
ment until some real facts were established. There
were, when these sermons were delivered, only the
unsworn statements of a passing mechanic, and
that of the girl herself, as evidence of the crime.
And the latter statement was inconsistent and
contradictory to a degree ; a philanthropic young
man from Bathurst, a designing cab-driver, an
address in a questionable part of Sydney,
and a rendezvous at the rubbish-heap of
the city—these were its chief features, certainly
suggestive of immorality, but not proof enough Of
iegal crime. Whence, then, did these orators
obtain the knowledge which enabled them to call
Aor the sternest punishment of the law upon these
untried men ? The men now in custody were
marked for sentence by these fervent clerics be-
fore their defence or the charge against them was
known, and if any of their future jurors were
among the congregations they were probably in-
fluenced to the certain disadvantage of the
prisoners. Public Morality” cannot be main-
tained by such sms against justice as these. But,
taking the pulpit anathemas by themselves, it is
remarkable that one point is left untouched. It is
urged that holiness alone can remove these “ out-
rages, but no mention is made of the fact that no
effort is made by the churches to reach the lowest
classes. Churches offer no inducement to men
who do not wear good coats, and who cannot sub-
scribe to church purposes. The typical cleric when-
ever situated is bon camarade to the rich and
aristocratic, and will loftily patronise the stray
workman who may come to his church, but of
active sympathy with the degraded ones there is
none shown by himself or his chosen “ set.” If
the Church has the elevating power which is
claimed for it, why is this elevating power never
tried where it is most needed ? The answer is
that the Church has grown too aristocratic;
respectability is the curse of modern religion. In
England, says a recent number of a home journal—
t° a man, associate with such men as Lord
St. Leonards, the Duke of Marlborough, the Karl of
■Shrewsbury, the late Lords Aylesford and Lonsdale, as

Marlborough, Shrewsbury, Aylesford, and
Lonsdale (a married man who was the other day
lined for kicking an actress’ husband out of his
the Earl’s “ private sitting-room,” where his lord-
ship was in quiet confab with the lady)
these are none of them such as a man “ with
the spirit of David ” — ahem ! — would converse
with, but the bishops spend their times in salaam-
ing to these ‘ noble ” debauchees, regardless
of the spiritual destiny of the less distin-
guished and socially lower herd. As a proof that
a dilution of the same sentiment animates some
of the Australian parsons, the Rev. W. G. Taylor,
a leading Wesleyan, to whose pulpit-slush the
Herald gives over a column, in the course of his
Waterloo sermon remarks :
“ Some of the noblest men in the land—some occupying the
highest positions in social life— led lives of impurity ruining
artless young creatures around them to such an extent as to
make one wonder that the judgment of God was not at once
sent forth to put an end to lives so vile."
How noble men can lead such lives is a puzzle to
the ordinary mind, yet this man preaching on
behalf of a church which is nothing if not demo-
cratic, goes out of his way to point out the nobility
of askunk who commits crimes which it “ would be
unjust to the brute creation to call brutal.” And
the same cringing to respectability is shown by
the apostle of Wesleyanism in his statement that
“He himself dared not speak as he could speak of what he
had seen as he had walked about the streets of this city at
midnight engaged in rescue work, when he had had to gaze
around him as he turned the street corners, to see that he
was not observed speaking to the poor lost girls he was trying
to rescue and to win to morality and Godliness.”
W hat good does he expect to do by sneaking round
on his missionary work 2 No man ever did much
as a reformer who looked round the corner to see
that no one was about to view his stealthy efforts
in a good cause. Is it that it is not respectable for
a clergyman to rescue Magdalenes, or is it that
the clergy are so little honoured and esteemed that
the object of their converse with abandonnees is
certain to be misconstrued ? Either alternative
proves that the clergy have lost that force and
boldness which made converts, and led to martyr-
dom. Holiness and fashion, piety and the conven-
tional usages of the world, have eaten the heart
out of Christianity, and the studied platitudes and
strictly conventional language of a Barry, as well
as the aristocracy-worship, and genuflexion to the
idol of social .respectability of the Rev. W. G.
Taylor, all prove that it is hopeless to expect
much in the way of social reformation from the in-
vertebrate, timid, wealth-worshipping skeleton
which now aspires to hold up the banner of the
Founder of the Faith.
Every man in the community who is the owner
of an ounce of sympathy must bestow at least a
portion of it upon the Sydney Daily Telegraph.
That paper got hold of what seemed to be a real
good thing in the shape of an “ outrage ” in Sydney
Domain, and gleefully invested the skeleton nar-
rative with the vestments of a surpassing indigna-
tion, and held up the manufactured figure as a
comprehensive atonement for all the vices already
proved to be inherent in the Chinese. But the
police court proceedings ripped the editorial
adornments from this figure and discovered to
public view a very different apparition. The
“poor innocent unsuspecting girl” who had
been the subject of so brutal an “outrage” was
shown to be not so much a victim after all—in
fact, the evidence seemed to hint that the “ vic-
tim ” was even partial to such occurrences, and
was not in any sense very much better than “ the
men who,” &c., &c. It really is very unpleasant
for the D.T. to be so deceived ; this seemed to be
a first class weapon to use in defence of the much-
cherished Chinaman, but proved to be a very in-
ferior club after all. For about the thousandth
time in its history the D. T. has been badly left,
therefore anyone who has the smallest portion of
spare sympathy ought certainly to let it go to that
very much edited and exceedingly excitable
journal.
Prince Alexander of Bulgaria is a patient
and long-suffering saint. Throughout his recent
troubles he was only once heard to use cuss ex-
pressions, and that was when he got back to his
kingdom and found Victoria’s telegram lying on
his desk. It contained only sympathy, and was
marked “ collect.” There was Is. 6d. to pay,
which only left the Prince 3d. to go on with.
The Germans are a contented people and
hate innovations. The Postmaster-General sent a
letter-box to the village of Drehkan, and the
people took the excrescence up by the roots and
sent it back, saying it was “ an undesirable and
totally superfluous piece of furniture. ” If Dreb-
kan were in N.S.W. the Postmaster-General
might send an elephant there without the faintest
chance of a refusal. The gift would be accepted
without thanks, and the people would begin to
agitate and to send deputations to Sydney asking
for a whale as well.

BY FLOOD AND FIELD.
It was a very well-known Sydney book-
maker who spotted a splendid thing in Ring-
master for the Metrop., and seeing such a lovely
chance of landing a little fortune, it was only in
accordance with his business reputation that he
should go to work very quietly and back that
horse for all that there was in the market. But
the owner of Ringmaster wished to have his share
of the plunder, and when he found that this was
not obtainable he calmly scratched the horse, and
now a very clever “bookie” is sadly wondering
how he came to be “ had ” for £lOOO.

A sensational event comes off this Satur-
day night at Foley’s Hall, Sydney: Lees, of Vic-
toria, and “ Black” Jackson, of Sydney, fight for
the pugilistic championship of Australia. The
betting is pretty level, each man being thought
invincible by his friends. On paper the affair
should be a foregone conclusion in Lees’ favour,
he having twice defeated Farnan, who as often
performed a similar office for Jackson; but still
in spite of past records we pin out faith to the
“ brunette,” who is unquestionably the cleverer
man of the twain, though he needs good seconds
to steady his pace.

Mr. Ironside tells us we were wrong in
stating that the score of the Parramatta Alfred
C. C. (508 runs) in a single innings is the largest
made by any club in the colonies ; as on April
23rd, ’7B, in King’s School v. Oaklands, the former
scored 532 runs in one innings—J. Hillas made
120, W. S. Brown 114, and E. Pell 105. The
highest total ever made anywhere in a single
innings was 1238 by the Ulster Club in ’75 on the
Pigeon Ground, Pyrmont, Sydney.

Beach’s victory over Jacob Gaudaur in
their race for the world’s championship and £lOOO
is in every sense a popular one, for Beach has
always been as honest-as he- is game.—there is not
the shadow of a crooked transaction to darken his
name. While rejoicing in the victory of our man,
sportsmen of Australia pay an enthusiastic tribute
to his gallant adversary, who seems to have rowed
perhaps the most brilliant, as it was the fastest,
race ever seen on old Father Thames. Both
pulled with the same dogged determination, and
neither yielded a jot to the hitter end in a contest,
the record whereof is 17sec. less than the wonder-
ful time, heretofore the fastest on record, made in
the Beach-Teemer race. On this occasion, Wil-
liam hadn’t time to set his cap at “Australian
ladies on the banks.” The latest is that Hanlan,
who accounts for his tardiness on the plea of ill-
ness, is on his way to England, and wants Beach
to row him on the Tyne. Should the champion
beat Ross on September 25, he will be well out of
England. We hope to see him return unbeaten,
and to row but one more race in Australia —viz.,
on the Parramatta against Gaudaur, who, as he is
many years younger than the Illawarra man,
must, so far as Beach is concerned, eventually be
the champion.

The Referee, after remarking that the
recent sculling match between Perkins and the
Australian Kemp was one of the grandest strug-
gles, one of the most cruel and doggedly-con-
tested races ever seen, goes on to say that though
Perkins stood the terrible tension the longer, he
was all wrong for days after his hardly-earned
victory. Yet Kemp, instead of giving himself a
rest, set to work next morning to reduce his
weight by heavy pedestrian exercise. The Re-
feree observes that if that was a fair sample of
the intelligent Australian’s method of helping
nature to recuperate, the sooner Beach took to
himself an English trainer the better.

Mattersou’s easy defeat by Lee has cer-
tainly been a surprise to us here, and makes us
think he must have been very stale. It is poor
work finding excuses for a beaten man, but after
the men he has defeated and the game race he
pulled with Teemer, we can hardly think he went
down on his merits. Matterson has been in train-
ing for a long time, and after pulling Perkins
twice and Ross and Teemer one on top of another,
must have come to the starting-point in anything
but good condition.

George Fletcher intends to shake up the 16-footers

nelly has worked a bow the image of Mr. Hyam’s

most profitable monopoly of the boxing business
in Sydney, is now to have opposition, Dooley and

Engine-street, Haymarket Beach has offered
to row Hanlan on the Parramatta, laying £lOOO to

Sir Henry Parkes spitefully wants the
N.S.W. Speaker’s salary reduced from £l5OO to
£l2OO. This childish move of Sir Henry’s re-
minds one of the little boy who cried because he
wanted the moon.
William Matheson, a member of the
N.S.W. Soudan Contingent, was found drowned
in Wellington Harbour, N.Z., on September 6th.
He was a native of New Zealand and a well-
known athlete. He had written an account of
his experiences in the Soudan which appeared in
a Dunedin newspaper the morning of his death.
He is supposed to have fallen into the harbour
when trying to get into a boat alongside the wharf
on a dark night.
A blank statistical grain-form was sent
to an American farmer. It came back a few
days later with these words in pencil: —
“ All we’ve got in this neighbourhood is
three widders, two teachers, a patch of
wheat, the pig-scurvy, too much rain, about 50
I acres of ’taters, and an old fool who married a
cross-eyed gal because she owns 80 sheep and a
horse, which the same is me, and no more at
present.”
Mohammedanism has made a fair start in
Sydney, the festival of Eeduzzohah being cele-
brated with great pomp a few days ago. A large
number of devout Asiatics dressed themselves in
theatrical scenery and rolled up on the occasion, a
spotless bullock was killed, so were sundry goats,
I and all went off successfully. Mohammedanism
I promises to spread in N.S.W., some of the Moslem
I customs—especially that of having four wives—
being already very popular.
An : atrocious attempt to kidnap a judge
was • made in Sydney last week,, a thief being in-
tercepted just as he was making his retreat carry-
ing: His Honor tied up in a brown-paper parcel.
The package, in fact, contained the scarlet and
ermine-robes which the majesty of the law encases
himself in while on circuit, and but for the fact
that the- wig was overlooked, there would not
have- been enough judge left for an ordinary
Christian.' to swear by. Several of the N.S.W.
judges only consist of clothes.
Mr. Frank Rogers, counsel for Oarl ron
Bieren, pleaded in mitigation of sentence that his
client had a good pedigree and a bad digestion—
which so touched Judge Innes that he only seat
up the patrician dyspeptic for 31 months without
hard labour. Mr. Carl von Bieren, before his-con-
viction, belonged to that numerous class of gentle-
men who don’t know whether to throw themselves
on the mercy of the Court or enter a libel action
against the newspapers. It is no secret that he
fully intended to “go ” for several Sydney
journals had he been acquitted. Yon Bieren was
what was known as “ a good sort,.” and he has
quite a crop of friends who assort, and with some
reason, that, fraudulentinsolvency and all, his moral
turpitude is not one whit greater than that of
several most respectable- individuals who have
contributed to his ruin.
Our song of sympathy with Ballarat in its
“social purity” infliction has stirred the hearts
of many men in many places besides the mining
city. Even a Melbourne parson has lifted up his
voice against the Ballarat “Inquisition.” So
liberal are this gentleman’s sentiments that they
deserve a line. “ The time may come when wo
shall be angels and archangels, and spend the
countless ages in playing upon golden harps. We
are not angels yet, but men and women living on
the earth, with certain passions, feelings, desires,
and aspirations.” There now ! The gulf which
separates Holy Church from Messrs. Tom Walker,
JossSymes, and Co., isgraduallybecomingbridgod.
It is refreshing to And a parson admitting the
existence of those “passions, feelings, and de-
sires ” which parsons so freely indulge. We have
hopes of the orthodox, even yet.
The Corporation of London propose to<
spend £30,000 or so in raising graven images of
four tough old murderers— Richard 1., who mas-
sacred 3000 defenceless prisoners ; Edward 1., who
slaughtered the Welsh and Scotch and wanted to
have his worthless carcase boiled after death and
his bones carried at the head of his army; and
Edward 111. and Henry V., who lied and plun-
dered and murdered in vain in the attempt to steal
the French crown, and at last departed in com-
pany with a lot of other brands all tarred and
dried and kerosened for that remarkable burning
that H. A. Long takes such an interest in. There
is something really cheerful about this way of
spending money, when thousands of people in the
self-same city are dying of hunger. How is it that
every “ corporation” is so blatant and swinish —
how is it that no gentleman ever becomes an al-
derman ?
The French Club of Sydney gave an
elegant farewell banquet on Saturday night last
to Le Comte de Louvieros, who leaves for Franco
by the Oceanien. The speeches made have caused
a terrible hullabaloo among the Jingoes. The
N.S.W. Chief Justice said in effect that ho wel-
comed France as a neighbour, and didn’t grudge
her the New Hebrides; the N.S.W. Premier,
according to the reports, treasonably said that
“France was in the front of European civilisa-
tion, and we should cherish friendship with her” ;
Colonial Secretary Bibbs said that the only anti-
French agitators in N.S.W. were the ignorants
and the religious bigots; and Mr. Julian Salo-
mons, Q.C., supplied the climax of “sedition”
by talking “somewhat prematurely,” says the
D.T., about “ the Australian Republic.” Sir
Patrick Jennings, the spineless, now alleges that
he didn’t utter the words attributed to him ; but
we are glad to notice that Sir James Martin, Mr.
Bibbs, and Mr. Salomons stand by the words
ascribed to them. Sir Patrick is invertebrate and
should keep out of such bad company as that of
Sir James and the Colonial Secretary.

Speaking of the recent livening up in the

fessor of Classics on the staff of the Sydney
Nooze remarks Time was when the ultima
thule of a colonial soldier was deemed to be that
ho should ‘ cut a figure’ on parade.” Ultima thule
is good, and now we’d like to hear something
about the non compos mentis of the Professor
himself, or the ex nihilo nihil fit of the whole of
the Nooze’s brilliant Je ne sais quoi banditti.

Yen Lung has gone back to China. Yen
Lung hung himself at Ballarat in 1865, and for 21
vears he has been mouldering in the grave while
his spirit smoked a shadowy opium-pipe on the
banks of the Styx. He was dug up recently, how-
ever and put in a bag to be taken home. He had
to be hauled out of the tomb piece-meal, a Mongol
cook having attempted in vain to drag him to the
surface by his legs and only succeeded in pulling
him to fragments in the effort. When he was
safely packed up, his cousin Wee Too slung the
remains over his shoulder and wandered about for
half-an-hour breathing words of sweet affection to
the object in the bag. There is no doubt some-
thing pathetic in the idea of communion with the
dead but the pathos wears off a little when the
scene is made up of a Chinaman embracing a
dusty rib and talking of love to a spine and a
batch of miscellaneous pagan bones.

At a Hawkesbury River fishing-camp the
campists went to a farmer’s house to buy some
water-melons. One of the party put down a flsh-
ing-linc with a hook on which was some bait.
The farmer’s pig immediately incorporated this
with his anatomy, and then, after taking two or
three half-hitches of line round the legs of some
of the audience, sought refuge in the sty, whence
nothing could dislodge him. ‘ Look here, mate,
said the farmer, “ you’ve spoiled a bloomm fine
•niu with your cussed carelessness leavm yor line
nbout. That pig’s worth two notes, and you can
just hand ’em over and take the pig, and
clear out of this.” “ Well,” stammered the ap-
palled flshist, “I don’t think he’s quite worth
that, but I’ll tell you what—you gimme five bob
and keep the fishing-line.”

At Lithgow (N.S.W.), the doctrines of
neace and goodwill are being sawn asunder by
the malevolent influences of grog. In that beer-
sodden region liquors have hitherto been sold at
six-pence each, but thelocal “ Grand United Three-
nennv Drinks Association ” demand a reduction to
threepence, while on the other hand the Publi-
cans’ Protection Union ” are bent on maintaining
the ancient figure. The Grand United Drunks are
carrying on the campaign vigorously by boycotting
the local Bungs, and though they present a sinister,
drought-stricken appearance, and are footsore
through trudging over the length and breadth of
fhc land in search of cheap alcohol, they
Sow no signs of giving in. The struggle
recalls some events which happened in Far
Northern Queensland many years ago On
the Hodgkinson, in those days, a furious
competition raged between sixpenny murder at
Paledonia camp and the delirium, insanity and
snakes vended in Thornborough at a shilling. The
latter beverage found scope for slaughter chiefly
through the presence in the leading Thornborough
shanty of one Jimmy Hunter, a weazened shrunken
dwarf who in the adjacent dance-room extracted
heavenly melody from the bow and the inside of
the cat—until the stalwart Julia who ran the
most prominent Caledonia bar, resolved to kidnap
the musical atom and end the strife at one fell
blow Accordingly a band of miners raided Thorn-
borough one dark night, and the only local fiddler
found himself seized by a burly ghoul who rammed
him into a sack fitted with holes, from which his
head and arms were allowed to protrude, skmg
him over a pack-horse, and carried him off m
triumph. Which deed of abduction utterly
crushed Thornborough in one act, and soon a
Ser could drive a spike into his coffin for six-
pence in any part of the Hodgkinson.

In a weltering and sinful Queensland town
there is a man who so far perverts the custom of
the place as to get drunk occasionally and start
It praying as a steady job, and usually in the
liddle of the main street. When he relapses
ito sobriety he is every bit as sinful as the worst
f his neighbours, but with each renewal of the
um-soaking process, piety once again possesses
is soul of which it has a freehold as long as the
pree lasts. He is a perfect puzzle to the local
heologians, and they cannot determine whether
t is best that he should keep in a perpetual state
>f drunk for fche good of his soul, or be a teetotaller
md a blasphemer, with a big chance of coming to
, r ief in the hereafter. They would probably agree
’o keep him on a chronic drunk were it not that
hey would have to stand the racket, for he has
not a cent. ; and they possibly would keep him
rlways sober if it were not for his rooted aversion
to that virtuous state. Ho is a puzzle however
you look at him, and was obviously created for
the benefit of Y.M.C.A. debating societies.

The Argus has fairly grasped the difficulty
in connection with that there bishopric. It
would be a sound investment,” says the chosen
organ of property, “ on the part of the wealthier
members of the Church of England if they were
to raise the endowment to a more satisfactory
figure. Considering how much the Church may
owe [true, indeed !] to the bishop for its success,
the least thing they can do is to provide such a
sum of money that the very best men will feel
themselves amply rewarded for accepting a colo-
nial position.” Let us have a rhyme. Not a high-
class pome, but one in keeping with the subject
“ Their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and
Duchess of Connaught left England to-day on
their return to India.” —Reuter’s telegram.
A young German, named Adolph Boldt,
suicided in Melbourne last week. It was the old,
old story of love and gunpowder. Adolph came
out to Australia to build a nest for his pretty little
birdie, who had promised to fly from the Vater-
land and join him. Luck was against Adolph,
and his girl got wind of the fact that the con-
struction of her nest was proceeding but slowly.
She accordingly “broke off” with Adolph, and
that misguided young man inserted a gun-barrel
in his mouth and pulled the trigger with his big
toe :
Lines to the Fickle One.
That fatal shot has o’er the seas
Your own and Adolph’s knell borne,
For, though you live at home in ease,
Your Boldt is shot in Melbourne.

At Napier, N.Z., there is an obese elderly
party who weeps for his wife and refuses to be
comforted. A few months ago his son, aged 19,
was spooning round with his best girl when the
old man came across them and fell in love with
the lady at first sight. As the result, he straight-
way offered to bestow his horny hand where his
cowhide heart was already gone, and a marriage
was the result. But in a very short while the wife
regretted her bargain, and the son has now eloped
with his ready-made mother, and the head of
the family is plunged into gloomy despair.
Whether he will take refuge in the divorce-court
or not remains to be seen, but a case with a son as
co-respondent would possess all the charm of sub-
lime novelty.

The N.S.W. Government’s intention to
celebrate, as the “ Centenary ” of the Australian
nation, the hundredth anniversary of the day on
which the first convicts landed at Botany Bay, is
already derided by more than one Queensland
paper. Sir Patrick Jennings’ absurd proposal re-
calls a good story. When the 77th Regiment
landed in Sydney after the Crimea, an applieation
was made to the colonel for the loan of his band
for “Anniversary Day.” “Humph!” growled
the grim old officer, “Anniversary Day—the
Thieves’ Jubilee ! 1 suppose we must do it. Tell
the bandmaster to get ready the Rogues’ March
with variations.” Should the N. Govern-
ment be so pig-headed as to persist in keeping-
up ” this date of shame, what a snigger will go
round among the “ distinguished company when,
at the bogus “Centennial” banquet the chair-
man, whoever he may be, stands up to propose
“ The Day we Celebrate! ”

A Jewish literary and debating society has
just been floated in Melbourne. The worthy presi-
dent announces that the object of this society is
“to teach Jewish youth something about the
Jewish race, as well as a horse race.” ’Tis a noble
end, but it will never be arrived at. The young
Ikes, and Loos, and Moshers won’t interest them-
selves in any race unless they can open a book
on it.
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
Like a message from heaven, that is wafted
To earth in an angelic song,
To soothe the sad souls of us mortals,
So seem thy glad tidings, O ! Cheong.
By a horrible dread we’ve been haunted
For months and for weeks and for days
But now, light of heart and undaunted,
Rejoicing we go on our ways.
By the sons of that country whose monarch
Is akin to the Moon and the Sun,
This country—oh, can we believe it,
Good Chinkee ?—will not be o’errun ;
They have really no cause that is moving
To fly from the land of their birth,
And to journey afar, ever proving
The wondrous extent of their worth.
Good Cheong—gentle, yellow-cheeked charmer,
Like music thy words to our ear ;
Like the splash of the spring in the desert,
Revealing that water is near ;
And we ask thee, with proud exultation,
In speech that is pithy and plain,
To collect the stray sheep of thy nation
And lead’’em to China again.
They are useful, and patient, and smiling ;
Their morals are all that is nice ;
They haven’t a word in their language^
Which could be translated as “ vice :
They are cleanly and sweet in their quarters,
But yet do we fervently pray,
For the sake of our sisters and daughters,
That an impulse will lake ’em away.
There is a certain bishopric
Which now a-begging goes,
For when ’tis offered to a priest
That priest turns up his nose ;
It is not that the work is much,
The life too hard or rough—
One fault alone that billet has —
The screw is not enough.
Rent free and eighteen hundred pounds,
That is the yearly pay—
A paltry wage with which to cheer
A bishop on his way ;
For that he’s asked to leave his home
And pitch his tent abroad—
Scarce £4O a week to fight
The battle of the Loard !
Another thou, (or even more)
At least they ought to add,
And then the bishop’s berth would be—
Well, not so very bad ;
The lesson of the past is plain
(We learned it in a trice)—
The men who sell the Bread of Life
Are putting up their price.
A Word With Baron Reuter.
Have they laid us down a cable
Where the raging waters hiss.
That you, Baron, might he able
To send telegrams like this ?
We ask now, what the deuce is
It to us where goes Connaught ?
Ah, how base, how base the uses
To which cables may be brought!
If to puerile tastes you’d pander,
We would rather have, by far,
Some more “skite ” by Alexander,
Or some bosh about the Czar ;
Though our interest in such is
Very feeble, we confess,
In this blooming Duke and Duchess-
Well, our interest is less.
Baron, hear our prayer pathetic :
Let these greasy items slide,
For they act as an emetic
On an honest man’s inside ;
But stay ! You might (for this is
What might happen, don’t you know)
Wire if Connaught and his missus
Make a trip to Jericho.
POLITICAL
POINTS
7 Ah English Tory journal triumphantly re-
works that Imperial Federation is “ now in the
air.” That is so, and it will always stay there.
Were we Dr. Ross, M.L.A., we should he
proud of having been burnt in effigy—by the
ruilians who, while doing it, gave cheers lor
Coonan.
The French voters are now completely in
a minority in Alsace-Lorraine. At the late elec-
tions no member of the French Protest Party was
returned.
The subscription-list opened with a view
to enabling Mr. Ninian Melville to square his
creditors and retain his seat in Parliament has not
been very successful.
“Missions to the Heathen” simply mean
the opening of new markets at the point of the
bayonet. “ For every Christian wo have made m
India,” says Canon Farrar, “we have created a
hundred drunkards.”
Says the Globe of Mayor Young “ A
far more acceptable and intelligent purpose lies
behind his festivities than is usual in these
junketings, and he will not fail of public appre-
ciation accordingly.” We don’t wonder what this
means.
In the Indo-Colonial Exhibition is the
inevitable gilded pillar representing the bulk of
gold raised in Victoria to date. A London paper
suggests that at next Exhibition the colonies
should send a pillar-effigy representing in gold
their debts.
At Condobolin the other day Lawyer
Coonan, M.P., said “My mind is clear, and I
still have a higher tribunal to appear before than
the N.S.W. Supreme Court, viz., my conscience.
We are glad at least to hear that there is one
lawyer who has a conscience.
Mr. J. P. Abbott takes The Bulletin
view of the bogus Centennial. He says that he for
one is not disposed to ask the world to meet in
January 1888 for the purpose of commemorating
the shame which environs the foundation of the
convict colony of Botany Bay.
“ No longer do we bow down to Pope or
Czar—no longer do the nations recognise the
divine right of certain families to rule and rob
them,” quotes the Macleay Argus. We wot of
one nation that recognises the divine right of cer-
tain families to rule and rob it.
“ Mr. Alexander Woods has been appointed
Canadian Agent-General to Australasia. The
appointment is said to have been made for the ad-
vancement of the trade interests of the Dominion in
these colonies. The news is welcome. Sydney is
just pining for want of some more consuls, and
things.
J. B. Neild, M.P., says that if the N.S.W.
Ministry wore not 'so completely ruled by some of
their supporters, public business would be less
delayed. Similarly if Mr. Neild were to get a
Providential visitation of lockjaw, there would
be a chance for Parliament to go ahead with
public business.
Who is this Mr. Wilshire who is touring
N.S.W. to work up the centenary celebration—
and who or what pays him for his trouble ? At
Wagga he tried to convince people that they
yearned for an exhibition, but after hearing the
oratory of Messrs. Halloran and Kerr, the meet-
ing decided otherwise by 19 votes to 4.
At last we know it. The Great Jawbone
has condescended to explain that he spoke for nine
hours in the N.S,W Assembly, “ because if he had
not done so, nine other members would have
spoken for one hour each, which ‘ would have
been all the same.’” Jawbone, you are wrong!
Some of the nine might have managed to say
something.
We ask that N.S.W. constituency why it
should continue to return a gagged member.
Whenever the “honorable gentleman ” rises to
move any resolution which isn’t perfectly in accord
with the views of a certain political magnate op-
posite, the latter whispers: “If you don’t with-
draw that motion Til produce that letter. ’ It s all
about a girl.
Mr. Quin, of the Sydney Sacred Heart
Debating Club, thinks it a sorry outlook for the
colony when such men as his co-debaters, Messrs.
A. E. Wiley and Crick, aspire to wear the mantles
of Wentworth, Cowper, Donaldson, and Martin.
We are anxiously waiting to know whether Mr.
Quin is ready to immolate himself on the altar of
his country.
In the Washington House of Representa-
tives last month during debate, Member Laird
called Member Cobb a liar. Subsequently, in the
lobby, Cobb retorted with an oath that Laird was
a perjurer: thereupon Laird hit out and drew blood.
Premier Jennings should challenge Cobb and
Laird to come over and fight Clarke and Lyne on
the “ Day we were Lagged.”
N.Z. has at last got far ahead of N.S.W.
in the matter of railway muddlement. A gentle-
man bearing the Sanscrit name of Smith sent three
logs by rail a distance of 25 miles, and when he
called to pay the freight, the Pooh-Bah who
greases the engines in that region demanded £l4
carriage and £l5 demurrage. The timber was
worth about £9, so Mr. Smith let the Government
keep it, and it is rumoured they mean to saw it
up into Premiers.
Kiama Reporter asserts that one line on
the Berry estate, at Nowra, N.S.W., measures
two miles 26 chains more than the length stated
in the description of the grant. If this be true, a
whole legion of selectors may eventually succeed
in obtaining freeholds there, for areas in excess of
that for which grant has been made, since the
N.S.W. Land Act of 1884, still belong to the Crown
no matter how long they may have been in posses-
sion of grantees or their successors.
Touching that Presbyterian spec,
New Hebrides, it is gratifying to learn that “the
mission land is held with properly-certified
title deeds.” So says the irrepressible Mr. Baton,
and we accept his statement in good faith. A
legal-minded missionary engrossed the agreement
on the fly-leaf of a bible, and then a chieftain
dipped a piece of stick in the rum-bottle and
affixed his mark. But it is feared that a French
corporal has purchased the remainder of this
valuable territory for a quart of absinthe.
No Australian Contingent shall ever smoke
and lounge and curse on the walls of Khartoum.
The “ rebels ” have wiped out Gordon’s city ; the
lonely goat now stamps on the Pasha’s throne,
and the remote African cow sits in solitary state
in the halls which that hero trod before he was
prodded by treacherous spears across the shining
river (pathos). There is nothing left to fight for
on the Upper Nile, and only the shadow of past
glory, some bones, and a bell-top hat with the
crown stove in remain to unfold the tale.
Mr. Slattery’s motion, in the N.S.W.
Assembly, that N.S.W. and other colonies and de-
pendencies should subsidise England as a testi-
mony of loyalty, &c., is still unmoved, and will
probably continue to be so until the Day of Judg-
ment. It was dated first for June 8, but has been
postponed by half-a-doxen stages to October 1, on
which date it will be further postponed. The
wily Tom could not stand the ridicule involved in
proceeding with it, although it is good for a lot of
kudos from those who are “ loyal ” to the verge of
idiocy.
Mr. Ross, of Camperdown, publishes a
pamphlet to show what Freetrade has done for
Ireland. At the Union in 1801 it was agreed that
the Irish protective tariff should be abolished in
40 years. In 1821 the country had a population
of 0 800,000 ; in 1841, after 20 years of protection,
this had increased to 8,175,000 ; while 20 years of
Freetrade brought the total down to 5,798,000 in
1861, and these were starving. In the old days
Ireland had some of the finest manufactures in the
world. To-day she has nothing but potatoes,
dynamite, disaffection, misery, and ruin.
The Queanbeyan Age suggests that, should
Sir Charles Dilkc visit N.S.W., an attempt should
at once be made to induce him to settle in th 6
colony and he should be offered the Premiership.
It very justly observes that a much worse man
than he would be of incalculable benefit to this
suffering land, and his scarcity of morals cannot
do much harm to a crowd of legislators who have
none at all, so that “until ruined by association”
he would be an unmixed blessing. Moreover, he
is as good a man as ever he was; the trouble
only starts when he gets into other people’s
houses.
The “ ex-M.L.A.” who is summing up the
members of the N.S.W. Parliament in the E.
News says that Mr. F. J. Gibbes, M.L.A.,
originally owed his seat for Newtown to his dili-
gence as a municipal councillor. “He made the
municipal officials loathe the very sight of him.
He was as instant in demanding the removal of a
dead cat from a gutter as in seeing that,” &c., &o.
We don’t know whether this is true of Mr. Gibbes.
But, anyhow, it is a good figure of speech. The
average aldermanic, secret society M.P. simply
gets into the Assembly because he picks up more
dead cats than anybody else. ,
The following are samples of the ques-
tions used in the catechism published by ths
People’s League in England, a body that intends
to abolish the House of Lords “ What are men
made peers for ?—For various reasons. Name
some of them ? —For winning battles, for serving
their party in the House of Commons, for being
old and no longer of any use to it, for being
troublesome to their colleagues, for being behind
the times, and for being political nuisances that
cannot be got rid of in any other way. Are great
men of science ever made peers?—Never. How
many clergymen are appointed to their livings by
peers ? —Nearly 5000.” We needn’t ask after this,
why men are made C.M.G.’s.
What has the N. S. W. Freetrade Association
to say about the following advt. from the London
Standard :
“CHEAP LABOUR, CHEAP LABOUR.—To Manu-
facturers requiring, the advertiser can offer a
French Military Prison in the North of France, where IUU
men are employed. The remuneration to be paid as
wages is If. per man per day. Open to offers to
treat for the whole or a portion of the above for one or
more years. Various kinds of work can be undertaken,
as mat-making, basket-making, brush-making, boot-
making, helmet-making, and saddlery work. Apply by
letter to A.N., care of Messrs. Beal, Son, and Chartres,
20, Regent-street, Waterloo-place, London, S.W.”
Suppose some N.S.W. capitalist bought cn qvos
the labour of the New Caledonian convict prisons,
would Messrs. Pulsford and Co. allow the pro-
ducts to come in untaxed ?
Long years of Government extravagance
have taught the N.Z. people how to get revenue
out of most things—even other people’s misfor-
tunes. Bankruptcy is a fine art in the Britain of
the South, and, after a good many attempts, the
Government have learned how to make it pay.
Last year there were 1870 bankrupts in the
colony, and the fees paid into the Treasury under
the new Act came to £18,526. The Government
paid for managing and winding up the estates
£9917, and, of course, pocketed the odd £8609.
The sum wasn’t much, but it was on the right
side of the ledger, and it was no doubt comfort
ing. Meanwhile the creditors got on an average
three shillings and a farthing in the pound. Let
us hope they were comforted too.
When Judge Docker compared the N.S.W,
justice to a machine he came pretty near the
mark hut for the sake of accuracy he should have
explained that he is a hybrid between a harrow
and a steam-roller. One of these gentlemen with
his steam-roller side uppermost heard a case up
North a few days ago, a widow being charged
with neglecting to send her boy to school, and in
consideration of the fact that she was almost
penniless he let her off with an aggregate damage
of 16s. She had only 11s. in the world, and
begged with tears to be allowed till evening to
raise the balance, but the official beak only glared
and refused. Ultimately a gentleman in court
squared the difference, and the solemn jaw of Aus-
tralian justice relaxed once more into a smile.
This country is governed too much.
At a certain Queensland port the officials
have an ingenious way of reckoning tidewaiters
pay. These waiters are engaged at 10s. 6d. per
diem, and fees and overtime at fixed rates are
payable in addition. But the higher officials
work it thus : Suppose a man has worked 20 days,
and has earned £4 10s. overtime besides, the
latter amount is deducted from the £lO los.
otherwise earned, a voucher for days at 10s.
6d signed, and the sum, £6, paid over with the
£4 10s. payable for extras, thus making the total
equal to the amount due, less overtime and fees.
This has to be read carefully. Queensland finance
is not to be easily comprehended. If the waiters
should earn more overtime than pay, it is sup-
posed they would have to denote the i surplus “
Government. It’s nice to be a tidewaiter at that
port.
“ I wonder,” says an English writer,
“what effect the reading of paragraphs descrip-
tive of “marriages in high life” has upon th
mind of the daughters of the labouring man
They must surely conjure up strange fancies as to
the amount of money expended in the purchase of
dresses, with their gaudy accompaniments, ana in


the costly preparation for the marriage festiva
Further, they must think it a strange wor
where a farthing to millions is of as much valu
as a five-pound note to the favoured few. On
would expect that young girls, with their tende
cies towards freedom, would be red-hot Dem
crate. It is very remarkable, though, that the
political tastes in England lie almost exclusive!
Torywise. The teaching of the State-paid parson
impressing the holiness of unwavering obedienc
to a criminal social system and to our “ pastor
and masters ” accounts, in some measure, for th
state of criminal degradation.”
Sir Henry Parkes, be it said to his eterna
credit, voted the other night for the Abolition
Flogging Bill, Premier Jennings, who, on h
public utterances, is pledged to help in abolish
ing flogging, did not vote on the occasion. Her

England, the home of Free-trade and the
Bible : —“ Hundreds of men are standing abou
the streets all day long with nothing to do, yet
bravely and patiently bearing their bitter trials
Hundreds of little children, emaciated and naked
save for a few dirty rags, hang about on the door
steps with gaunt, famished faces and hungry eyes,
too weak, too starved to play. My friend, in the
course of conversation, was informed by one old
fellow that he had had no work for two years, and
was getting used to being without food aT day.
The worst time, he said, was last winter, when ho
had nothing for five days but an apple and some
chestnuts. There are in Middlesbrough at the
present time 2000 men out of work, and as there
is only one main street the sight of all this misery
congested into it is appalling. There is very little
crime, in spite of the distress. The workhouse is
full, the money in the hands of the trades’ union
nearly exhausted, and as there is little chance of
matters righting themselves in Middlesbrough,
owing to the falling oft’ in the iron trade, the out-
look for these ‘unemployed’ is not a pleasant
one.” This, in a country where the bishops have
from £3OOO to £(>0,000 a year, is to be expected.
One of these individuals lately died and left to his
family £470,000 ! wrung from the misery of thou-
sands who “have nothing for five days but an
apple and some chestnuts.”

How fleeting is fame ! Not three years
have elapsed since Rosebery was the idol of the

read that in transferring the license of the Earl of
Rosebery Hotel, Melbourne, the court granted
permission “ to change the name of the house to
Clarke’s Hotel.” Heigho! In another decade,
probably, there won’t be a single Carington Arms
left in New South Wales.

Mr. C. E. Pilcher, the well-known bar-

of this month. Mr. Pilcher is famous among the
members of the legal profession for never never hav-
ing in his life accepted a brief to which he could not
give his undivided attention. One Sydney bar-
rister has been known to hold briefs (or rather to
hold money for those briefs) in four cases proceed-
ing in four different courts on the same morning.
A tale of Kimberley. Price, Government
resident, has a Chinese cook. The other day that
dingy Asiatic was at work by the wayside on a
leg of mutton for the great man’s dinner, when a
big bearded digger, whose aspect told of Idwt, to
the square-mile, came in sight and stopped to
gaze at the frizzling hindquarter. Then he calmly
seized the meat, and turning to the astounded
Hung Fat, said, “ John, you tell your master I’ve
taken this. He can get another ; /can’t.”
The present Duke of Cambridge ought,
with good luck, to draw his £12,000 a year, as
Commander-In-Chief of the British Forces, for
another 20 years. His mother has just come up
smiling to her 89th birthday. The Duke, we
guess, will “ like a soldier fall ” on a comfortable
spring-mattress at the green old age of a hundred
or thereabouts. And, so far as the enemy’s bul-
lets are concerned, there will be nothing to pre-
vent that other royal warrior, Connaught, from
living for ever.
The Victorian Government is at last fairly
quit of the Kelly gang trouble. They have granted
£lOO compensation to Mrs. Jones for the loss of
her son and daughter in the “ siege of Glenrowan.”
The young people were held as prisoners by the
redoubtable Ned, and were unfortunate enough
to get in the way of some police bullets. Mrs.
Jones has been a long while getting her compensa-
tion. Possibly the Government held out on the off
chance that death would remove her ere a settle-
ment was arrived at.
Father Manuel de Viliga is a party who is
about to enjoy rather a lively time. Manuel lately
let Sin. of daylight into his bishop with his little
stiletto, and now he is sentenced by the Madrid
authorities to have his vestments torn from him
by two bishops and two priests. A bishop will
next scrape his shaven poll with a knife, and then
sand-paper it till it shines like a monster door-
knob. This will remove all traces of consecration.
Then they’ll strangle Manuel with a clothes-line
and he can finish his fight with the bishop in the
hereafter.
Mr. Thomas Clapp, a witness for the de-
fendant at the Von Bieren trial, deposed that Mr.
Carl Hiram Clinton Walbridge, &c., Von Bieren,
was closely related to the Von Bierens and Van
Burens, of New York, who were two branches of
one family, and held a high social position in New
York. Witness had seen prisoner’s name in the
Von Bierens’ family Bible, and often heard in-
quiries after him after he left New York.” Now
“Von Bieren ” is a German name, while the Van
Burens are a Knickerbocker family. This, how-
ever, is a queer world.
The estate of the late Mr. Thomas Walker
is given at a million and a half. The uninitiated
may, however, be surprised to learn that this
valuation is only an approximate one, arrived at
on the basis of a kind of running account kept by
the old man wherein all his property was set
forth at cost price. For instance, his Bank of
N.S.W. shares would be at £25, and his Collins-
street (Melbourne) property is down at what it
cost 16 years ago. Even the stamp-affidavit,
which usually fibs somewhat, will show a bigger
total by something like another half-million of
money.
“ Through some informality in the pur-
chase of Mr. F. Morgan, junior’s, share in the
Mount Morgan mine by Messrs. Hall and D’Arcy
some years ago, it is rumoured that those gentle-
men have had to pay the original owner £lO,OOO
to set things straight on his recent coming of age.”
Thus the Daily Northern Argus last week.
1 his little “informality,” it would appear, was
the fact that young Morgan, being a minor, was
unable to legally sign the necessary papers at the
time of selling his interest, and at his majority
put the price of a cool “ ten thou ” on his auto-
graph.
The series of death-warrants, extending
from 7th April, 1808, to Bth December, 1832, be-
longing to Sanson, the notorious headsman of the
Revolution, has just been acquired by the City of
Paris. The collection was bound up in 19 volumes,
and Sanson has prefixed to each volume a sum-
mary of the contents. During 25 years Sanson
executed 7113 capital sentences, being an average
of over 300 executions in each year. During the 25
years he only twice ascended the scaffold without a
fatal result —one of the occasions was in 1815,
when Count Lavalette escaped through the hero-
ism of his wife.
Frank Weston has been telling a melting
story of his financial misfortunes in the Melbourne
courts. But the law has a hard, hard heart, and
poor Frank has failed, up to the present, to obtain
the dispensation, or release, or something, which
would enable him to face his most truculent
creditors with serenity. “ Wizard oil,” it seems,
is almost a thing of the past. The manufacture

That wicked paper, the Pall Mall, won’t
let poor Sir Samuel Wilson alone. It keeps talk-
mg about the time when he was plain Samuel,
and when his friends hailed him as “ Sam,” or
mmifly yeUod I say, you 1 ” and it also says that
when he arrived in London he found himself an
obscurity until he procured a great personal ad-
vertisement by buying the retreat of Burke and
Beaconsfleld, and got himself Barnumised by all
the newspapers, on the strength of these ready-
made ancestors. “Ho has hoisted himself before
oaa P M b !_ C ’< but 18 stm dangling.” Then the writer
adds that he plays the host on an extensive scale
and endeavours to feed himself into vogue,” an
unworthy suggestion which would seem to imply
that he hopes to carve his baronetcy out of a
aunch ot vension or to find a peerage floating in
he soup. And after all Sir Samuel’s hospitality,
the Gazette does not even give him credit for
being sociable : it merely says, “he is as gregari-
ous as his own sheep.” Such is fame !
A certain great warrior while at Port
Moresby, New Guinea, was invited by Skipper
Mackenzie, of the Thursday Island steamer, tc
dine on board one day at 1 o’clock. The skipper,
however, went ashore and forgot all about his in-
vitation, and was discovered by the great warrior
(who had got tired of waiting on the beach for the
boat) at 1.30, putting away a square meal at
Goldie’s store. Exclaimed Mackenzie (a perfect
little bear): “Oh, by Jove, I really forgot all
about you! But, never mind, old man, come
along and feed here.” The hero then stood upon
his dignity and would not be pacified ; so at last
little Mackenzie said ; “ Look here, my son, if you
don t like it, you can go to •, and if you don’t
care to do that, you can take it out of me. I’ll fight
you with fists, swords, gatlingguns, scissors, or any-
thing you like.” “Well,” said the warrior, “I
don’t know whether you are joking or in earnest;
if you are joking, all I can say is that it’s in ex-
tremely bad taste ; but (rising slowly and frown-
ing severely) if you—are—in earnest —but, there
(sitting down again) I don’t think you are in
earnest!” And that was all!
The Referee
There is a 12-stone amateur in Goulburn
who is very anxious indeed to box Mr. George
Seale. He says he cannot see how a 10-stone man
can stand against a man two stone heavier if the
latter keeps cool and “ counters” properly. But
then he forgets that Mr. Seale’s life has been one
weary round of wiping the floor with 12-stone
amateurs who “ couldn’t see,” &c.
* * *
Referee suspects that funk is at the bottom
of the Australian Eleven’s many defeats, and re-
marks that the series of checks they have met
with will “ have the effect of preventing another
Australasian expedition to the Old Country for a
good while. Once in every two years is rather too
often.” The Referee obviously doesn’t know the
Australian Eleven. They don’t mind meeting
checks so long as they meet cheques.
* * *
We had a private conversation with the
undertaker’s horse just before he started for the
N.S.W. Derby. Said he; “I don’t like blue
ribbon ; I like crape. lam afraid my master will
never be a success on the turf. Under it —down,
down six feet —is his game.”
* * *
Mr. F. G. Moule, speaking at a meeting
of the Melbourne Cricket Club, ascribed the Aus-
tralian Eleven’s reverses to over-banqueting. The
insinuation is ungenerous and absurd. Two of
the most signal defeats sustained by the present
team were in “ All England ” matches, and it is a
dead certainty that with their personal reputation
at stake they came fit enough up to the scratch.
VVe should fancy that over-anxiety was what they
suffered from most.

Mr. Maitland, the owner of Meteor, told
“ Nemo,” of the Herald, that he “ hadn’t six-
pence on the horse.” All the while, however, the
facetious Mr. Maitland was quietly “ filling up ”

“ crowd.”
* * *
According to London gossip, the “Austra-
lian Abroad ” has been having his little flutter, on
the turf. We are told that “ a young Victorian
millionaire” landed a grand coup over the Eclipse
Stakes. He took £3OOO te £2OOO about the winner
and £l5OO to £5OO about the second horse getting
a place. The chronicler of this transaction inno-
cently assumes that “therefore the young gentle-
man went home richer by £4500 than when he
started.” It doesn’t at all follow. Possibly the
youthful “ millionaire” dropped a bit over the
other events of the day and forgot to publish the
particulars. But anyhow, taking three to two in
thousands is rather like licking honey off thorns,
and if many of our distinguished representatives
have been going for these grand coups the British
bookmaker must be waxing fat on colonial gold.
By the way, it seems that every Australian in
England (not excepting George Collins Levey and
the Vagabond) is accepted as a millionaire. In
the same confiding style, we accept on trust the
distinguished pedigrees of all new chums who wear
eye-glasses and tight pants.
* *
A Times correspondent points out that in
the Surrey v. Australia match there was a cm-io-
sity, new in first-class cricket; two of the Surrey
men beat the Australians in one innings off their
own bats by 38 runs. Australia in the first innings
scored 185 ; in the second, 107. In the one Surrey
innings, Maurice Read scored 186 ; Abel, 144.

There is very little encouragement for the
guileless stranger to dabble with coursing events
in Victoria. The Hawthorn Puppy Stakes, run at
Moonee Valley, seems to have been a masterpiece
of crookedness. Considering that this was only
an eight-dog stake, the amount of “ arrange-
ment ” it inspired was nothing less than pheno-
menal. Four dogs and four men have already
been disqualified over the job, all bets are declared
off, and more explanations are demanded by the
stewards. The canines probably sinned in ignor-
ance. They didn’t know that they were running
under assumed names, and passing themselves off
as puppies ”at a mature age. But they were

Shrewsbury’s penchant for stopping balls
with his legs, when he can do so with safety has
provoked a mild protest from a London pkper
The practice is not pretty, but it is a question
whether Shrewsbury’s stand at the wicket is not
preferable to that of W. G. Grace or Tommy
Horan neither of whom leaves anything but pads
to bowl at. Against the “champion,” in particular,
appeals for leg before” are quite as frequent as
in the case of Shrewsbury, and they are more fre-
quently allowed.

The wholesale fining and “suspending”
of jockeys, to which we have become accustomed
of late, is a turf development calling for more than
passing notice from the Press. Sixteen jockeys
rode in the Hawkesbury Handicap, and 14 of them
were fined for disobedience at the post. On paper
it would seem that the average Australian jockey
revels in insubordination and general cussedness.
But, as a matter or fact, he is better behaved and
more respectful than his upstart English brother

Apropos of this we suggest a few “safeguards” of our own —no charge.


Society
A most delightful evening was, we are told,
spent recently by the young ladies of Hurlstone
Training College, Sydney. They gave a fancy-
dress ball, at which only ladies were present. One
half of the fair creatures were attired as soldiers,
sailors, mashers, and as miscellaneous examples of
the tailor-made animal who is so very superior in
feminine eyes when he wears anything in the shape
of a uniform ; while the other half appeared in the
ordinary garb of woman. We’d much like to have
been there. And so, too, we dare say, would a
large number of the bald-headed school-inspectors.

The mock-solemnity and vulgar pomp
which are so dear to the undertaker —and to his
clients —are slowly dying. On the occasion of the
funeral of the late Mr. Shepherd Smith, general
manager of the Bank of N.S.W., the church and
altar were decorated with white flowers, and there
was no outward sign of mourning in the edifice.
The funeral was totally destitute of dismal
pageantry.
* * *
The next of kin of the late Mr. Thomas
Walker, of Concord, Sydney, are much exercised
in mind as to the matrimonial intentions of Miss
Edith Campbell Walker. Should that lady die
without leaving children the next of kin afore-
said will be entitled to £500,000.

The correspondence-column of the Sydney
D.T. now seems completely in the hands of that
milk-and-water zealot, “E. J. H. Knapp,” nervous
old maids who want to carry revolvers, and the
exponents of prigdom and slobber generally.
Amongst a number of hysterical suggestions lately
made in that “ valuable journal” is Mr. Charles
Moore’s proposal for the formation of a kind of
private vigilance committee —Mr. Moore doesn’t
say whether it is to be on the lines of the saintly
Adelaide organisation of that character —for the
purpose of “protecting women.” We have a dim
and shadowy remembrance of a Sydney police-
court case in which a Mr. Charles Moore figured
as having objected to an affectionate husband put-
ting his arm around his (the affectionate hus-
band’s) own wife’s waist while sitting on a seat in
the Botanic Gardens. There is such a thing in
this world as too much Moorality.

At a Sydney restaurant. Gentle-voiced
woman relating anecdotes of native barbarity:
“She ran away with somebody. Her husband
caught her and cut her feet so that she should not
run away again, but he did it as soon as he caught
her, and so he had to carry her back ! (Sweetly)
Wasn’t he stupid ! Of course he ought not to
have cut her feet till after he had got her home !”
Sympathising listener : “To be sure ! He should
have waited.” We commend this pleasing story
to those philanthropists who object to sundering
what God hath joined together.

The Waverley people, lacking funds to pro-
perly maintain their glorious park, have long been
compelled to let part of the ground to Chinese
gardeners, whose presence would spoil even Para-
dise itself. It has now been determined to get rid
of the unsesthetic Confucian. Funds for park-
maintenance are to be raised by a flower-fair, to
be opened as it is hoped by Lord and Lady
Carington on the 16th October. Fancy costumes
worn by the stall-holding banditti are relied upon
to add to the beauty of the scene.

A great deal of attention is now given in
Sydney to “invitation-cards.” We have not for-
gotten the huge plank issued by Mayor Young.
Not to be far behind, the return ball committee
has sent the Mayor a perfect hoarding representing
a view of his residence, the exhibition that he (?)
built, hops (a pun in colour, we fancy), and many
other fixings. The Mayor has accepted it.

man, met with a terrible accident. He was in
the maintop when the truck fell, breaking in his
forehead and almost crushing out one eye. His
life was for a time despaired of, but we are glad to
hear that he is improving. He seems fated, as some
time ago another middie shot him through the
nose “ in play.”

The following choice item comes from the
Sydney D.T. : —“At Lymdale, Potts’ Point, on
Wednesday evening, the 15th inst., Mrs. Gullett
afforded a small circle of .friends an opportunity
of hearing a recitation by Professor Parker, which
was deservedly appreciated by those who had the
privilege of being present.” Ahem! It’s so nice
to know what’s going on in the “ hupper suedes.”

bridesmaids.
* * *
We are afraid that “ Pendragon ” (Mr.
Henry Sampson) will get himself disliked in Aus-
tralian sassiety. In his latest letter to the
Referee he courteously remarks : —“ Unless my
experiences are altogether at fault, two colonial
ladies can give the proverbial pig under a gate,
for noise, several pounds and an easy beating.”
He further says—and this will particularly distress
Toorak and Darling Point :—“ These colonies
ought to be very loyal, if one is to judge by the
names given them, not at the time of their dis-
covery, but comparatively recently, and now
borne so proudly. King George’s Sound is old as
a title, but Albany is of late date, and means the
prince of the blood who died not so very long ago.
Then there are Adelaide, and Victoria, and a
whole host of big and little and middle-sized and
important and inferior and mediocre places, every
one of which is consecrated to some one member
or other of the beloved House of Brunswick.”
* * *
Touching the “baby boarding-house”ques-
tion, which is just now agitating the police mind
of Melbourne, the Age says that “ Victoria has
not yet become so over-populated that she can
afford to look with a calm eye upon the infant
destruction which is reported to be carried on.”
The morality of that sentence is worthy of the
journal in which it appears. The Age evidently
considers that babies ought to be protected up to
a certain point only. But when Victoria does be-
come over-populated it will be necessary to think
about legislating for the trouble. The Govern-
ment of the day can introduce a Baby Suppression
Act and offer a royalty on the scalps of the little
innocents.
* * *
At a certain recent New England (N.S.W.)
wedding, the bridegroom made quite a sensation
by blowing a large bugle-horn around the town-
ship for the edification of the natives. When he
had finished blowing his own trumpet he left it at
the local railway parcel-room in the care of the
clerk; but shortly afterwards, hearing its well-
known strains, he at once went for his “music,”
and, ye gods ! found a local Chinaman attached
to the mouthpiece “ giving it lip,” to the amuse-
ment of several facetious onlookers. People are
wondering whether the happy "wain will get a
new bugle.
THE “AGE OF REASON.”
“Minnie Wilkinson,” in a letter to the Sydney D.T., sug-
gests that, in view of the present prevalence of fearful outrages,
“every girl who has attained the age of reason” should carry
“either a bulldog-revolver or a pinfire-pistol.” Our artist has
here depicted the Wilkinsonially-armed female of the future.

A terrible catastrophe befell a young
couple who, the other day, had a tremendously
swell wedding. She took away with her up the
line the usual 40 trunks, and they arrived at the
honeymooning spot before it was discovered that
she had forgotten to bring the keys of the boxes.

Your writer of society pars, is expected to
have a deft and delicate hand. The subject is to
be just daintily effleurk, with a light and breezy
touch, as of a fire-fly’s wing. The Echo people
know this. That’s why their description of the
festivities on board the Nelson the other day was
such a lilac-tinted success. The duchess who
wrote it says that the light was “ modulated by
an awning.” “Modulated” is good. There was
also a “happy blending of the opposing arts and
peace and war—the formidable guns and the
various munitions of deadly carnage consenting to
lend themselves to a more merciful purpose.”
When we read that delicious bit about the for-
midable guns (howwid things !) and the various
munitions of deadly carnage, we positively thrilled
with sympathetic emotion. Had the writer been
handy we would have fallen on her neck and
caressed her —with a meat-axe.

“ Old Artilleryman ” points out in a Syd-
ney daily that a great deal of unnecessary crime
and not a few desertions are caused in the N.S.W.
Permanent Artillery force by the fact that the
non-commissioned officers and men are denied the
privilege (granted in the Victorian force) of wear-
ing civilian clothes when off duty. The writer
adds that the knowledge that he will be forced at
all times to wear the uniform is a drawhack which
prevents many a young man of the right
character and physique from joining the N.S.W.
force. “Old Artilleryman” is right. In Mel
bourne, some years since, a fine, well-set-up
young fellow, who wore a most fascinating frock-
coat and eye-glass, and heroically endured a collar
that came within a tenth of an inch of cutting his
jugular, attracted much attention in Collins-street.
Well, when this young man (who, by the way, was
an educated gentleman, and a right good sort)
wasn’t mashing ’em on the block, he was mount-
ing-guard, or something (without the eye-glass)
in the uniform of a private soldier at the local
barracks, for a net screw of say one and six a
day. By-and-bye, a handsome young widow
came along, and snapped him up ; and now, in-
stead of being a private at eighteenpenoe a day,
he is a bloated but hard-working merchant, an
officer of militia, and a distinct ornament to Vic-
torian “ sassiety.” The chances are that had
this young man been compelled to appear in uni-
form on all occasions, the widow would never have
concentrated her gaze upon him and he would
still have been mounting guard. If the men of
the New South Wales Artillery are not allowed
sometimes to wear private clothes, then their
officers also should be ever compelled to appear
in uniform. These military swells are, for various
private reasons of their own, glad to get out of
uniform sometimes, though it might be just as
well in the public interest if they applied to them-
selves the rule as to clothes that they so diligently
enforce with respect to their men, some of whom
know quite as much about soldiering as do the
gorgeous array of field-marshals, generals, and
colonels located at Paddington and the harbour
batteries. Yes, let us by all means keep our
colonels and majors eternally in uniform. Then
we’ll be able to watch them, as we watch the
poor, underpaid, and comparatively innocent red-
coated postman.

The Randwick Derby Day of 1885 will be
remembered among the most enjoyable anniver-
saries of the contest. Everything
went to contribute to the success of
the occasion. The weather, which,
after all, has more to do with
pleasure on such occasions than even
the races themselves, deserved our
warmest thanks. As usual, the dust
along the Randwick Road was all
a patriotic alderman could wish for.
Left to its own sweet impulses, and
unrestrained by the vulgar trammels
of a water-cart, it rose on the balmy
air and had a “ real good time.” It
found out the secret places in one’s
coat or dress and filled them with
lavish generosity—we mean dust.
It is scarcely to be expected that
the “ city fathers” can neglect
their little contracts and do their
duty. We never expect them to
and they never disappoint us. On the
course, matters were better ar
ranged. But we must protest against
the barbarous mode of vending
tickets. The scene at the ticket-
windows is a disgrace to civilisa-
tion ; the public suffer long, but
we fancy if they simply rushed the
gate and refused to pay, the law
would deal leniently with them.
With this exception, the manage-
ment is to be congratulated, but
a little more attention to the lawn
would prevent bald patches of sand
showing all over it. The band of
the Permanent Artillery (which, by
the bye, has greatly improved of
late) began to play at 1 p.m., and
shortly afterwards H.E. and Lady
Carington came on the ground ac-
companied by the usual “Aides”
and attendants. Our hints on dress
do not seem to have been thrown
away on some of these Government
House young men, and we are
pleased to chronicle a great improve-
ment in their attire. We do not re-
member ever having seen more
fours-in-hand at Randwick. Some
were well worth looking at and
some well worth burning ; but, on
the whole, the carriages were hand-
some and the horses well up to the
mark. The lawn was very largely
patronised by the ladies, who were
evidently anxious to show their
spring dresses. In this they suc-
ceeded. When Mr. White’s Trident
landed the Derby, the pretty colt,
with the “ blue ribbon ” round its
neck, was led up to Lady Carington
to admire, and some 2000 persons
rushed from the saddling paddock
to admire Lady Carington ; all were
satisfied. The racing was admirable
throughout. Lady Carington wore
black silk and black lace, neat and
quiet as usual, with overall of grey
Melton cloth, slashed with tartan
silk facings. All eyes were turned on
Mrs. Terry, the bride of a fortnight
ago, who appeared in brown canvas
and red merveilleux satin with hat
to correspond.
Old Sir John Robertson’s last bust is to be a marble one,
and ought to satisfy him for some time. The promoters are
heads of the N.S.W. Civil Service, who wish to show their
gratitude for the many salaries the grand old man voted
them. A strong committee is formed, including Mr. Crit-
chett Walker, Mr. John Rae, Mr. A. Oliver, and many
others. Sir John gave Signor Simonetti, the sculptor, a sit-
ting on the 13th inst. Mr. G. F. Wise is hon. treasurer.

Wild flowers are having rather a bad time of it around
Sydney just now. Kogarah has determined to hold a native-
flower show, and Government has offered to employ its forest
rangers to gather and contribute flowers from the National
Park. It seems to us that the Park is not intended to be run
in the interests of Kogarah, nor are the rangers paid by the
State for that purpose. The object of the show is wisely left
unstated, but we suppose it is the usual curate business.

Mayor Young, aware of the uncertainty of human and
Mayoral life, has arranged a Jubilee Australian Municipality
meeting ! The thing sounds formidable ! He won’t wait for
that Centenary, but is going to have this little affair on the
12th prox. On the 14th, H.E. has to feed the aldermanic
corporations, and has consequently scoured the South Seas
for turtle. Sir P. Jennings also ‘ 1 extends his hospitality,” and.
though the fact is not mentioned, the only Dailey will “orate.' 1
Prior to returning to Germany, the land of music, that
clever pianist, Herr Koehler gave a farewell concert. Lady
Carington was present, as also were the officers of the Ger-
man man-of-war. The gallery was crammed, but all the
chairs in the hall were not filled. Those near the vice-regal
party were not empty. In the jargon of the musical critic,
“ the recitals” were deeply interesting, each part of the pro-
gramme being “ superbly interpreted.” Herr Koehler was all
smiles.

On Wednesday, 15th inst., Mr. and Mrs. L. Aarons, of
O’Conuell-street, entertained a number of guests at Needs’
Rooms at a dance. Upwards of 180 persons were present,
among whom were noticed the Mayoress, Mr. and the Miss
Kiss, Mr. and Mrs. Skarratt, Mr. and Mrs. Alderson, Misses
Cohen, and Mrs. Frankel, &c. The dancing, which began at
9 p.m,, continued until the early morning. There were many
brilliant and elegant costumes, and a most enjoyable night
was spent.

At the club. They gave Brown a very bony help of fowl.
Said he to the waiter : “Take this back to the cook and say
from me that if he can't carve better he will have to be dis-

what did the cook say ?” “He told me, sir, to ask you
whether you’d like a whole fowl.”
The Princess Beatrice has quite given up tricycling, an

the redundancy with him is in "cheek.”
At Wollongong (N.S.W.) a girl aged 18 years was charged
with having made a false declaration on the occasion of her
marriage. Among the witnesses was her mother, an astro-
nomical female, who said she “had just cause to complain
of her conduct since the transit of Venus seven years ago.”
The girl was only seven years of age then but that fiendish
transit demoralised her.
Abbe Liszt’s funeral was a great success. The “Master”

Old loves came for hundreds of miles round, and were, no

The patrons of a concert in Hobart, one evening lately,
had an unexpected addition to the entertainment, A banker
and his wife were confronted on leaving the hall by an in-
furiated member of the demi-monde, who ventilated her
grievances in the crowd, disclosing some alleged facts “ not
intended for publication.” The police came to the rescue,
and the mondaine is now in gaol.
At the Beautiful hash-house village of Manly—which has
of late years become far too civilised to be pleasant—an en-
joyable promenade concert took place on 16th inst. The 2nd
Regt’s. band provided good instrumental music, and Miss
Qlendinning sang “It was a dream.” We did not think so,
we thought it was something else, but refrain from saying
what. Usual crowd—usual chairman.
At Auckland, N.Z., the performance of amateurs under the
direction of Herr Carl Schmidt, of “ Lee Cloches de Come

Grenicheux (Mr. J. Edwards) leaves for Australia shortly
with a view of adopting the lyric stage as a profession. Mr.
Du Faur, another amateur, has a splendid voice. Auckland
is just now the place for managers in search of musical
talent.
A Masonic ball held in Hobart Town Hall on 2nd inst. was
a great success. Many of the ladies’ costumes were hand-
some, and among the pretty faces honours were considerably
divided. The Misses Lewis wore pink silk and tulle: Miss
Susman, black satin and lace; Miss Marsh, pale blue and
creme; and Miss Walker (from Adelaide), in white lace,
were all admired, while the married ladies surpassed them-
selves. Mrs. E. L. Crowther wore a very pretty costume of
white satin and beads; Mrs. W. Ferguson, creme etamme;


Mrs. Walter Watchom, blue with coffee lace; and Mrs. D.
Lewis was gorgeous in creme, with red and gold striped
satin. Some exceptions to good taste were present in the
forms of a “grass widow” who appeared in a pink gown very
unbecoming to her complexion; the wearer of a black and
cardinal costume with her face rouged to match; and a
bljick costume trimmed with silver, unpleasantly suggestive
of a coffin.
At Hyde Cricket Club concert on Tuesday last one per-
former sang an adaptation of “ Other Arrangements ” which
ran;—
“ Mr. Wright, they say, is an innocent man,
But he’ll have to make other arrangements,”
and so on, ad nauseam. Considering that some of Mr
Wright's family were there, this savoured rather strongly of
an 'Arryism which called for the “oat” quite as loudly as
many other less fashionable offences.
The epidemic of giddiness in South Australia is affecting
all classes alike. The Harmy has got it very bad just now.
Not even the band is free from its ravages. A nineteen-
year-old Salvation drummer named Brown has eloped with a
fair-fat-and-forty married woman named Prior. They first
met at “ knee-drill,” and they subsequently met on the
strict Q.T. Query : How could drummer Brown love when
he had formed a Prior attachment ? '
Very recently the Footscray (Vic.) Council—perhaps in the
hope of their own individual turns coming in due time —
generously voted the Mayor an annual allowance of 2J per
cent, on the gross revenue of the borough. This arrange-
ment is full of promise for the promoters. At the present
moment a 2i percentage amounts to £250 per annum —in a
few years' time it would amount to five times as much. Out
of pure cussedness, however, 69 ratepayers signed a petition,
requesting that lucky dawg, the Mayor, to call a public
meeting to discuss his good fortune. He was amazed. He
laid the petition before his brother councillors. They were
amazed. The idea of ratepayers presuming to question the
private jobs of the mystic circle was altogether ridiculous.
Mr. Mayor was advised to treat the application of those
outside “nonentities” with silent contempt. He did, and
hence the trouble. A monster meeting of the nonentities was
held, awful resolutions were passed, and it looks as though
the 1\ per shent scheme will fall through. The eye of every
mayor in Victoria has been anxiously fixed upon Footscray,
and now those eyes are filling with bitter, bitter tears.
BRIEF MENTION.
Notice to Sydney mashers. —“ Puppies

History must be respected. The N.S.W.
“ Centennial ” drink will be rum.
That undertaker’s horse ran last for the
Derby ; he thought he was starting for a funeral.
A doctor is wanted at Nambuccra Heads
(N.S.W.) to fill along-felt want, viz., the local
cemetery,
Dibbs says he will suppress the sweeps.
We are sorry. We don’t like to see members of
Parliament go to gaol.
Burrawang (N.S.W.) is agitating for a
policeman. This, we presume, is a roundabout
way of saying that the local “ Slavics ” have gone
on strike.
The Revd. Ralph Brown is lecturing in
Victoria—subject, “My Trip round the World on
Six and Sixpence, and how I did it.” On the
cheap, evidently.
The Manning River Times reports that
a resident in that district is in a very dangerous
condition from an attack of dropsy, ‘ ‘ said to be
caused by drinking water.”
The leading toast at the so-called ‘ ‘ Aus-
tralian Centennial” will be, not “The Date we
Celebrate,” but “ the Day we Celebrate.” A dis-
tinction with a difference.
The North Queensland journalist is brief
and to the point. “We recommend the Inspector
of Nuisances,” says the Northern Miner, “to
Stand in front of Allen’s stores and sniff.”
Advt. from Sydney D.T.: —“ Lady partner
with £lOO wanted, to join another with similar
amount in purchasing an old-established lodging-
house. Eleven beds, nearly full of gentlemen.”
At Mirboo (Vic.), a J.P. has been fined
10s. for being drunk and disorderly. The pillar of
justice happened to be hard-up at the moment,
and was consequently sent to pine away in a
pestilential dungeon.
A condemned prisoner has had to be re-
moved from Portland (Vic.) because there was no
local gallows. It is hard for a N.S.W. man to
understand how any town can be run without a
complete set of hanging fixings.
An Adelaide boniface has been recovered
from the bottom of Torrens’ Lake. They say that
“ how deceased got into the lake is a mystery.”
Very likely he made a mistake and drank some of
the liquor set apart for customers.
The latest idea is to print newspapers in
luminous ink, so that they can be read at night.
•It will be a relief when we are able to speak
about “ that luminous leader in the Herald ”
without risking our immortal soul by perjury.
At Kempsey (N.S.W.) the local Charon
and the local parson have had a lawsuit arising
out of the former’s refusal to ferry the latter
gratis over the local Styx. Charon won. In the
next world the poor parson may get a cheap pull.
Religious mania at Melbourne. An Irish-
man rushed into a Salvation Army meeting with a
razor in his hand. It took three policemen to pre-
vent him from carrying out his dire purpose. He
had intended cutting the throat of the first trom-
bone.
A Melbourne paper says “ it is the criminal
ability that has made all the great judges in the
old country.” We never before saw such a state-
ment in print, but colonial experience inclines us
to accept it. Set a thief to judge a thief, doncher-
know.
“ Robt. Baine, printer, aged 20, has been
fined 10s. for walking about South Melbourne
dressed as a female with a sofa-pillow for an
improver.” The police saw through the disguise
at once. A woman would have worn at least two
sofa-pillows.
In Otago (N.Z.), a young lady chloro-
formed her father’s big dog and eloped with a
local puppy before the other animal had recovered
consciousness. It is now reported that she wishes
she had chloroformed the puppy instead and
eloped with the dog.
In writing an account of a ball at Rock-
hampton (Q.) recently, the reporter tried to say
that a lady “ looked au fait at waltzing,” but the
compositor made it appear that she “ looked all
feet.” The feet, we believe, were rather con-
spicuous, and that was why she was so angry
about it.
The Melbourne police have, it is wired,
“ drawn attention to the fact that a giddy dance
is being performed at a place of entertainment in
the city.” As the Victorian Ministry consist
chiefly of bald-headed men, we presume Police-
Commissioner Chomley has got from the Cabinet
a pinch for stale news.
A Commissioner in Lunacy was lately
visiting an English asylum. One of the patients
insisted that he was the Prince of Wales. “Oh
come,” replied the Commissioner, “ the last time
I was here you told me that you were the King of
Greece. “ Very true,” was the ready answer,
but that was by another mother.”
New Guinea correspondent of the S.M.
Herald; —“We found civilisation had made
rapid strides in our absence from Port Moresby.
A gaol was in course of erection, and the site for a
cemetery is marked out.” Which recalls what a
certain lady once said: —“ Mr. Stiggins, my
dear, is a very holy man—he believes in a material
hell, and his vestments are all that they should
be.”
That well-known individual who calls a
spade a spade is living j ust no w at Gundagai, N.S.W.
He writes in the Gundagai Times “to draw
attention to the fact that some dirty, filthy brute,
not fit to live.” &c,, and adds that “the contempt-
able skunk who has committed this gross outrage,”
&c. It seems that the bridge has been newly
upholstered and some one has been damaging the
paint.
The Melbourne papers have not yet done
gushing over Bishop Moorhouse and his remark-
able powers. To illustrate the muscular Chris-
tianity of that good and fortunate gentleman, the
Herald tells a story about him climbing Snowdon
in quicker time than a guide. The guide, it seems,
had a wooden leg. After this we are fully pre-
pared to hear that the Bishop can read small print
better than a man who squints.
“ These ‘ larrikin ’ boots,” said a Sydney
boot-factory manager when interviewed last week,
“give us more trouble than any others. You
have no idea how vain a larrikin is of his feet.
One of them with an ‘ 8 ’ foot will get into a ‘ 6 ’
boot, and the consequence is he always walks
with his toes doubled up beneath him. We make
the heels so high in these boots that none but a
practised man could stand in them, let alone walk
about.”.
On the road to Kimberley an overladen party
resolved to bury part of their stores. To mark
the spot and keep the treasure safe they put up a
tombstone bearing an unholy lie which repre-
sented the tobacco as a dead ratepayer, the
petrified delusion announcing itself as “ Sacred
to the memory of Peter —” This wickedness, how-
ever, did not prosper, for the next party who
came along dug up the grave and put the corpse in
their pipes and smoked it. The man who tells
this story also says that he killed 32 cockatoos
and 11 pigeons in three shots, so his yarn is likely
true.

Camby was proceeded against for the larceny of a
letter addressed to Mr. Whitely aforesaid and not

cently suicided in Townsville, had “knocked

nificent discovery. Interests have already changed

The latest about Spofforth is that he was at the
Canterbury (Eng.) cricket-ball “ enjoying himself

harmless in the waltz.” At Braidwood (N.S.W.)
when the news came that the town was to have a
railway, everyone “ was intoxicated with delight,
and ran about to and fro in an excited manner.”
We presume that “to and fro ” means in and out
of the local whisky-mills,,..The race-mare, Actress,

MATRIMONIAL MATTERS.
“ Reformer,” writing to the Sydney Evening
News on the Divorce Bill, says, among other
things : —“I would make it criminal for a Mian
to get married until he could prove (say to
the police magistrate of the district) that he
could properly support a wife. I would also
make it criminal for a young woman to get
married until, in like manner, she could prove
that she was tidy in her person and habits, and
possessed some knowledge of cooking.”
Oh, delicious ! We fancy we see ’em—
The man and his prospective bride—
Going up to be passed by the P.M.
Before they can have the knot tied ;
In “ our mind’s eye, Horatio,” we look on
A man who dare go into court
And unblushingly swear, the great Book on,
That he has enough to support
A colonial young damsel, whose notion
Of wedlock is wide of her vows,
Of obedience and lifelong devotion
To that humbled mammal, her spouse—
Who immediately after the marriage
Intends to play up and kick high,
And drive round with the loveliest carriage
And pair that mere bullion can buy I
Some ethereal sweet virgin with cheek as
Tne lily, and hair of old gold—
Some soft maiden as timid and meek as
A fawn, who will surely unfold
And develops a bit after wedlock,
And show who’s the “boss,” and proceed
To run Love and Bliss to a deadlock
Unless the old man planks the greed !
Who has yet passed her life ’mid the shadows,
And had till now no chance to sate
All her soul’s secret thirst for strange dados,
And hay-coloured hangings, and plate
Wrought from rare designs, ancient and costly,
And quite too unspeakably sweet;
And malachite card-tables, mostly
Borne on pearl-inlaid crocodiles’ feet!
Who designs, with a thought full of menace
To her hub’s purse, to give a grand ball
Every month, and run weekly lawn-tennis,
And have the “ best people” to call —
Think of him whom this girlish thing blesses
With her love, making ready to swear
He can keep her in diamonds and dresses,
And flowers, and old china, and hair I
Here’s a glimpse of the future. Miss Fanny
Fitz-Pottzpoynt is called on to prove
What her knowledge of cooking (if any)
Is like, at the jury-room stove,
While a bald-headed beak, who is toothless
And deaf and dyspeptic, hangs round,
And in tones that are beakish and ruthless
Finds fault where no fault can be found.
First of all he insists that her fritters
Are tasteless and burnt to a coal;
Then he further complains, and embitters
The hapless young candidate’s soul
By informing her that, for the sake of'
This life, which is sweet, he’ll not try
Her poor toad-in-the-hole, or partake of
Her pound-cake, or veal-and-ham pie !
Who, uncaring that his stern decision
May wreck the fair hope of two hearts,
Her plum pudding regards with derision,
And with open revulsion her tarts ;
Who maintains her short-bread must be shorter,
Her fish far more thoroughly fried,
Much more carefully browned her fore-quarter,
Ere she can be passed as a bride !
Whose relentless demeanour quite flurries
The maid who is trying her best
Through the medium of peppery curries
To render her lover more blest—
Whose Draconic judicial comment is
That she should not hasten to wed
A poor man whom a sea-cook’s apprentice
Would manage to keep better fed !
Who would fix a chill spectacled eye on
Her hash, and inquire if the groom
Was expected to live on, or die on
Such stuff; and, in words full of doom,
Worthy any fierce Crown Prosecutor,
Indict her endeavour at bread
As being tasteless as long-emptied pewter,
And fatal as death-dealing lead!
Who informs her, with sternness that, since pie
Is made to sustain, not to slay,
The best use she can make of her mince-pie,
Is to carefully chuck it away ;
Who exults in her woe, and, in summing
The case up, proceeds to explain
That there’s no sort of use in her coming
And wasting the Court’s time again !
Think of Love —the divine high emotion,
The magnet that draws heart to heart—
Being baulked by a magistrate’s notion
Of how you should make a jam-tart!
Think of two loving souls separated,
And left to wear life out alone,
Just because a grim P.M. has stated
That the maiden can’t “ devil ” a bone !
Think of this, O, most drastic “ Reformer ”
A youth is beloved by a maid,
With a love that is wilder and warmer
Than even poor Juliet displayed ;
He has gold in abundance—the sweet one,
In order to pass her “exam.,”
Has for twelve months read up Mrs. Beeton—
Can make all description of jam—
Can fold napkins three ways, can brew ketchup
That the P. M. himself must extol,
Can to ardour work e’en that old wretch up
By the way she turns out a rissole,
Can preserve hams, make yeast, and in hashes
Excel —can bring in a warm broil
Without any suspicion of ashes
Or cinders—can fry things in oil!
When the youth cannot win the sweet bride he
So longs for, because the cold Beak
Thinks back hair and a bustle “ untidy,”
He starts in a wild vengeance to wreak—
First, he brains the P.M. with the griddle,
Then he and the candidate oat
Two bath-buns not yet warmed to the middle.
And expire at the magistrate’s feet!
No, “ Reformer! ” There’s not any magic
In your help. Just let things abide
As they are. Life’s sufficiently tragic
At present for bridegroom and bride,
Over wedded life now there’s some shedding
Of tears —and some shedding of gore—
Only now this comes after the wedding,
While by your law ’twould happen before !
Up North, the other day, the Birksgate
(s.) saw a signal of distress. She headed for it,
tore through the water full speed for a whole
hour amid great excitement, and at last ranged
alongside a large full-rigged ship with the ominous
blue light still at the masthead. Then, in answer
to a hail, an officer solemnly inquired, “Which
side of the island ahead was reckoned the best
anchorage ? ” It was too much. With a yell of
rage the steamboat captain told the stranger to
anchor in the crowded depths of perdition, and
then he steamed away. It would have been
hardly possible to improve on the joke unless a
poker-party on board had run out of change and
the signal of distress had been hoisted with a view
to obtaining sixpen’orth of coppers.
The Bishop of Exeter has gone in for a new
line —the confirmation of idiots. The Church wants
recruits, and his reverence accordingly picked out
five promising young lunatics in the Western
Counties Idiot Asylum, and admitted them into the
communion of the English church. They were all,
of course, hopeless cases, for it would hardly do to
waste a shovel-hatted blessing on a lunatic who
might afterwards recover and explain that he
took the bishop for a circus, but the man with the
sacerdotal gaiters speaks highly of the “devout
reverence of these carefully-prepared candidates.”
And yet these youths, who are thus supposed to
understand all about the solemn mysteries of
religion, are not regarded as fit to be trusted out-
side the asylum walls ; they can hardly tell their
right hand from their left, and do not probably
know the difference between predestination and
potatoes, or between blue ruin and regeneration.
But perhaps this is just the reason why they were
regarded as such good subjects for confirmation.
The alleged victim of the hideous Mount
Rennie (Sydney) assault case tolls one of the
queerest stories ever heard of. She is 16 years
old, and was educated at Bathurst Convent. She
doesn’t know where she was born. She doesn’t
know her father ; she doesn’t know her mother.
She has no sister, but she has four brothers, three
of whom she knows nothing about, and the other
of whom she can’t find. Her uncle, a most mys-
terious person, wrote to her to come to Sydney,
but he didn’t turn up at the railway-platform
according to promise, and she could find out
nothing about him or his address. Her board and
lodging was for a week or so platonically paid for
by a benevolent young man whom she had known
at Bathurst, and after getting into and out of
various situations, each held by her for but a very
short while, she put up at the house of a woman
living in a back-lane in the Hayraarket quarter,
who obligingly charged her nothing for board.
Then one day, while walking in classic Sussex -
street near the Chinese quarter, she was hailed by
a philanthropic cabman, who, finding that she was
in search of a situation, volunteered to drive her
round, persuaded her to jump into his cab, and
finally drove her off, quite against her will, to
Moore Park, where, after escaping from the cab-
man, she fell into still worse hands.

ESTABLISHED IS*',',
WE have again much pleasure in addres: ' '
our customers and the public. The rn pi I
expansion of our business, and the repeated orc'j i
we receive from customers who dealt with us a
far back as 1882, are gratifying proofs that or -
Goods and our method of doing business give
satisfaction.
We continue the same system. We buy dir -it
from the makers in London, Paris, and New Y.i :
all such Goods, Watches, &c., as are not the pi-
duct of our Company’s own works. We ad I a
fair and reasonable profit, and SELL FOR CAP ,
thus avoiding bad debts, and steering clear of tuj
evil system of charging rates which compel pa.' i
customers to make good the default of bad ma -
HERE IS THE BASIS OF OUR SYSTEM.
The full value must accompany any order, or no atten > i
will be paid to it. Payment can be made by Postage Sta’.i .
of any Australian colony up to £1 worth, by Cheque, or ..y
P. O. 0., payable to the Oriental Gold Co.
The Goods ordered will be sent at once. If they are it
approved they may be returned per first post after del v ;
uninjured, and we will, according to the wish of the ousto . ~
either substitute another article to same value, or
WE RETURN THE MONEY IN FULL,
deducting merely the trifle of actual postal charges.
Thus: Suppose you want a Brooch —you describe, as no
as possible, the sort of pattern you prefer, or you leave i.,. -
choice entirely to us, and you remit, say 10s.
We endeavour to match your description, if sent, or in .. y
case we do our best to please and satisfy you.
On receiving the Brooch, or other article, if you don’t ent.. ' v
like the pattern or style, write by first mail explaining in w i i
respect you would like it to differ—returning the Brooch i
the same good order as you received it —thereupon we will
try again, and send a second one to same value.
Or, if you don’t like the first Brooch at all, and want j ir
money back, we will send back the full sum, less the po.. 1
outlay incurred.
We make this pledge in all seriousness, although w h
somethin? of a light heart; because, although we have fi.. ■ t
thousands of orders by post on same terms, during i’ii
four years we have been in business at our present address —
474 GEORGE ST.,
SYDNEY,
Opposite the Markets,
WE HAVE NEVER HAD ONE SINGJ.E
ARTICLE RETURNED!
Customers will save themselves a good deal of trouble wh *n
they desire to have a choice among numerous patterns, by
ordering a sample parcel and sending on the money for same
I We then send a variety, each article of which is marked wrh
its price, and the customer selects one or more articles, and
returns the rest, whereupon we send back the balance of the
money by next post.
SYDNEY AS IT IS.
AN OLD-ESTABLISHED BUSINESS.
THE REWARD OF ENTERPRISE.
That all the sights worth seeing in Sydney are
not available to the visitor who secures admission
by the payment of an entrance fee, is patent to
everyone who has by chance got off the beaten
track which connects the show places of the city.
Many, indeed, of those which would provoke the
highest interest and the most lasting satisfaction
are to be found in quarters where the sight-seeker
would be the least likely to look for them, or
expect to find them. In the great arteries of com-
mercial life, in the streets in which business reigns
supreme, there are sights to be seen of such
magnitude and importance, so much of novelty,
and such fabulous store of the world’s everyday
necessities that they come like a revelation to the
man who thinks he has “done” Sydney, and
suggests to him the possibility that he may have
commenced the wrong end.
Not that such establsshments can by any stretch
of the imagination be supposed to come under the
generic heading of “ sights” in the ordinary accep-
tation of the term, but that they are so self-consti-
tuted, in their relationship to the enormous trade
on which the wealth and prosperity of the colony
are founded. In this connection may be appro-
priately quoted the extensive wholesale iron-
mongery and hardware business of
MESSRS. T. W. EADY and SON,
centered in the handsome and commodious block
of buildings in Kent-street used as bulk stores for
the reception of imported goods, and in the actual
business premises, showrooms, and offices belong-
ing to the same firm in York-street. This well-
known business dates back to the year 1839, when
it was established by Mr. T. W. EADY as the
first tannery in the colony. As such it was suc-
cessfully worked for some years, developing
gradually by the addition of leather grindery,
shoe-findings, coach and saddlers’ ironmongery,
&0., always increasing and surely gathering the
respect of its constituents, and an ever-enlarging
circle of support from the general public. About
thirteen years ago the respected founder of the
business (Mr. T. W. Eady) retired from it in favor
of his son, Mr. R. H. Eady, who was joined by
Mr. J. J. St. Clair, since which time it has been
carried on by these gentlemen under the well-
known name of T. W. Eady and Son.
The tan yards have long since been closed, and
the specialities of the firm comprised under the
the heading “General Ironmongery” in its
relations to Builders, Furnishers, Spuatters,
Agriculturists, Coachmakers, Saddlers, Tanners,
and Curriers, &c.
The BULK STORES consist of a massive block
of buildings at the top of Kent-street, used solely
for the reception and storage of imported goods.
They are of five storeys, each of which is devoted
to a special class of merchandise. Under the
courteous guidance of Mr. R. H. Eady, a visit to
these premises revealed enormous quantities of
every description of articles suggested by the name
of the business, including Hickory Poles, Shafts,
Wheels, Spokes, Hubs, Tilt Hoops, &c., Lamps by
the thousand; all kinds of cunningly devised
vehicular springs, Tanners and Curriers requisites,
large crates of Crockery, and a generally bewilder-
ing quantity of articles, the very names of which
are a mystery to the visitor. Floor upon floor in
these warehouses, stacked with merchandise and
connected throughout with ponderous lifts, are
occupied by men packing, unpacking, classifying
or distributing the wares in each; and in the
basement are cellars of great area, containing
hundreds of tons of galvanised and bar iron,
cement, sheet and white lead, nails, and sundry
commodities known as “ builders’ hardware.” In
the oil cellar are tiers of casks of whale and cod
oils, with other varieties adapted for special con-
sumption ; the kerosene business done by this firm
being exceptionally large, and extending over a
very wide area of Australia. Amongst the brands
of kerosene is the now famous “ Snowflake,” large
quantities of which are placed in circulation by
Messrs. Eady and Son, and referred to by them
(with the encouraging admission to refiners and
agents of “Snowflake”) that the number of re-
orders of that favourite oil have marked its rapid
advance in public favour ; an advance attributable
to its purity, safety, and brilliance in combustion.
SHOW ROOMS and OFFICES.
These are situated at No. 36 York-street, and
maintain a reputation second to none in Sydney.
The building consists of five stories, each of which
is devoted to a display of samples of the goods
received from the bulk stores in Kent-street; the
first floor carrying the offices of the principals
(Messrs. R. H. Eady and J. J. St. Clair), and the
clerical staff connected with the establishment.
Each floor is connected by a lift, the motive
power for which is supplied by a neat little gas-
engine in the basement, which is also used as a
packing-room. In addition to the every-day
wants of a large population which are apparently
provided for in every direction within the limits
of this trade, there is a great deal that is interest-
ing and novel to an outsider. During the recent
visit of Mr. Eady to the United States and Europe
he appears to have been very successful in collect-
ing samples of inventive genius destined to pro-
cure for him the blessings of numerous victims.
Such, for instance, as
MUSGRAYE’S PATENT MILK TESTER,
an entirely new invention of English origin, which,
at the cost of a few shillings, enables the anxious
housekeeper at a glance to protect herself from the
machinations of the milk-adulterating fiend on the
occasion of his every visit. This necessary adjunct
to every domestic manager is in the form of a neat
crockery-ware mug, in which is confined in a metal
cage a small red object not unlike a diminutive
gourd ; if the milk poured into the mug be pure
the gourd rises with it and floats visibly on a level
with the surface. If not, it remains obstinately
at the bottom of the cage, and the prospects of the
milkman are at the mercy of his customers.
There is also a machine known as “ Evan’s
Patent Potato Washer,” a thoroughly practical
and cheap blessing, but characterised by so much
simplicity that the temptation to exclaim “ how
is it no one thought of it before ? ” is irresistible.
Many contrivances of a similar description, and
most of them designed with a view to the great
necessity of the age—saving of labour—are to be
found in this portion of the premises, and the
display of an attractive exhibition of lamp-ware,
leads to a confirmation by Mr. St. Clair of the
opinion that as a safe and excellent light, the
popularity of “Snowflake” Kerosene is assured,
no instance having come to his knowledge in
which it had failed to give every satisfaction to
their customers.
The privilege of inspecting such orderly, exten-
sive, and well-arranged premises as those known
to the commercial world by the name of T, W.
Eady and Son is impressed upon the mind of the
visitor by his introduction to a variety of subjects
of which he was previously ignorant, and by hav-
ing added considerably to his stock of knowledge
through the medium of his courteous guides and
the vast amount of descriptive information at
their command,
df
THE RULING PASSION.
AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER: “GREAT HEAVENS! THERE’S A MAN FALLING
FROM A SCAFFOLDING. IF I ONLY HAD MY INSTANTANEOUS APPARATUS
HERE, WHAT A STRIKING PICTURE I COULD MAKE OF IT?”
In Persia a bell rings for prayer five times
a day, and business men instantly rush out of their
offices and do a Mohammedan flop in the nearest
mosque, and yet nothing is stolen in their absence.
Perhaps that is because the people are heathens.
In this country, whence we send missionaries to the
heathen, if a man went out to attend prayers, he
would tie his clerk to a pump, lock up the door,
and then hire a policeman to watch the store and
a nigger to watch the policeman, and then he
would stay himself to watch the nigger until he
was too late for the service. Besides, he would
not go to prayers at all.
ECZEMA AND BAD SORES.
Your Outioxjra has done a wonderful cure for me more
than two years ago. Not a sign of its reappearance since.
It cured me of a very bad eczema which had troubled me for
more than twenty years. I shall always speak well of Cuti-
cura. I sell a great deal of it.— Frank C. Swan, Druggist,
Havenhill, Mass.
I had a dozen bad sores upon my body, and tried all reme-
dies I could hear of and at last tiied your Cutioura Reme-
dies and they have cured me.—Jno. Gaskill, Hebron,
Thayer County, Penn.
Proctor, the astronomer, in one of his
lectures, says:—“The idea of sacrifice was bor-
rowed from nations having a debased conception
of the Deity ! from men who imagined a God after
their own likeness. They gave Him all the attri-
butes of the being most powerful in their eyes —•
the Oriental despot—cruel and relentless if
offended, and ready to take offence at the least
(even accidental) fault of omission or commission.
The cruelties of the King of Dahomey scarcely
surpass those committed by Moses claiming
Divine authority for his conduct (Numbers, chap-
ter 31). The most debasing superstitions des-
cribed by African travellers are not more ghastly
than the method of divination by a medicine-test
appointed in the fifth chapter of Numbers.”
A JOKE ON THE JUDGE.
A Queensland Judge, who is the perfection of dignity on
the Bench, swore in a witness, rather frivolous-looking
female. “ What is your name?” “Happy Ann.” “Where
do you reside?" asked the Judge. The witness giggled and
replied, ‘ * What’s the use of me telling you where I live, you
wouldn't call on me anyhow—would you, Judge?” “Oh, yes,
I would, if you could offer me any inducement.” “ Oh, thank
you, Judge; indeed I can. I know your weakness.” As she
was leaving the court she tipped the wink and said, “ Will
the famous St. Louis Lager Beer be any inducement?” The
Judge adjourned the court and joined Happy Ann.
Marie Brizard ? Who is Marie Brizard ?
Sufferers from Rheumatism, Lumbago, Scia-
tica and other analogous affections should try
Freeman’s Original Chlorodyne, a medicine that
has, since its introduction in 1844, been tried on a
very large scale both by the Medical Profession and
the Public in every part of the habitable Globe,
with unvaried success. Since its introduction
into New South Wales the popularity of Freeman’s
Chlorodyne has been considerably enhanced, and
is now regarded as the most efficient and valuable
medicine that has ever been introduced into the
Colony. The Profession prescribe it; Missionaries
prefer and use Freeman’s Chlorodyne, and people
leaving Sydney for the interior invariably take a
sufficient supply to last them a twelvemonth.
Insist upon having “Freeman’s” only. Trade

Hockings, 143 Pitt-street.
The Queen’s visit to the Colonial Exhibition
had curious results. Society flocked to the show,
and the throng of beautiful women of the highest
rank was unprecedented since the earlier part of.
Her Majesty’s reign. The ladies’ dresses were an
exhibition of themselves, and the swell operators
among the London cut-purses made a field-day.
The Duchess of Westminster had a jewelled watch-
chain, worth two hundred guineas, neatly cut
away with pincers, and Lady Dudley lost a necklet
and locket, valued at three hundred and seventy-
flve guineas for the gold and gems alone. Asa
work of art and a family jewel the locket was
priceless. The Hon. Mrs. Cholmondely had a
jewelled bracelet actually stolen from her arm in
the pressure, and a most audacious attempt was
made to snatch a diamond earring from the car
of the Countess of Exeter by a person who dis-
appeared in the crowd. Not any of the st den
jewels have been recovered, despite the utmost
exertions of the police. The Marchioness of I'y
also lost a most exquisite necklet and locket, the
beauty of which had but a few minutes be "ora
been commented on by the Princess Beatrice ini
the private retiring rooms of the royal party ; ad
Lady Rosebery had a massive albert chain snipped
clean away from her watch. In these last tvo ■
instancs. however, London Society is laughing at
the expense of the thieves. It appears that a
great number of the leaders of fashion in Eng’mu’,
warned by past losses, do not wear their fa’" : 'y
jewels on public occasions, or when shop’ g.
They take the precaution to wear jewellery wlr cli
is indistinguishable from sterling gold and ”o il
gems, but which, despite its beauty and ig
quality, is comparatively costless. This is kn"wn
as Oriental Gold, which is made in all the r o:t
delicate and beautiful designs, and can there' o
be worn with impunity by the highest ladies Li
the case of Lady Rosebery and the Marchioi on
of Ely it was these goods which deceived ever, ' '.o
practised eye of the cleverest London swell nr ■-
men, and which had called forth the encomiums of
the Princess Beatrice. This curious incident has
occasioned quite a sensation in London, and b u
created an extraordinary demand for these orien' al
gold articles of jewellery. The manufactu c 3
have a branch in Sydney at 174, Georgo-stroA.
opposite the Markets, so that Sydney ladies ncol
not be out of the fashion.

ROWLANDS’ ODONTO is the best, purest
and most fragrant preparation for the teeth.
Health depends in a great measure upon the
soundness of the teeth and their freedom from
decay, and all dentists allow that neither washes
nor pastes oan possibly be as efficacious for polish-
ing the teeth and keeping them sound and white
as a pure and non-gritty tooth powder ; such
Rowlands’ Odonto has always proved itself to be.
ROWLANDS’ EUKONIA is a beautifully pure,
delicate, and fragrant toilet powder, and has
lately been much improved. Each box has inside
the lid a certificate of purity from Dr. Redwood
Ph D., F.C.S., &c. Sold in three tints; white,
rose, and cream.
ROWDANDS’ MACASSAR OIL can now be also
had in a golden colour, which is especially suited
for fair or golden-haired children and persons.
Four sizes.

Extract from Sydney Sunday News ;—
“ In our advertising eolnmns will be found the
public notices of ‘ Democrat’s ’ Consultations on
the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups for 1886, which
promise to be most popular undertakings on the
part of the spirited and enterprising promoter of
those wonderful ‘ fortune-making ’ lotteries. It is
not often that we have a good word to say of racing
consultations as a rule, but in ‘ Democrat’s ’ case
we can strongly recommend them to the public, as
we happen to know the moving spirit—one of the
right sort, and who is proverbial in racing circles
for honest and square dealing. One of the best
features of ‘ Democrat’s ’ consultations is the fact
of the drawing being conducted by a committee
of influential gentlemen, whose names are above
suspicion.”
Several other newspapers have borne similar
testimony to the genuineness of “ Democrat’s ”

SUPPLEMENT TO “THE BULLETIN."
SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1886.
NOTES ON THE RANDWICK SPRING
MEETING.
Tills week we present our sporting
readers with a sketch of the Sydney Derby
winner, Trident, whose phenomenal perform-
.ance on Saturday last stamps him as the
greatest equine wonder that has ever graced any
racecourse in the Southern hemisphere ; indeed,
we may safely assert without fear of contradiction
that his “gallop” has never been excelled in any
.part of the world. The hero in question first saw
light at the once famous Terrara breeding estab
lishment presided over by one of New Sout
Wales pillars of the turf, Mr. E. De Mestre. A
is pretty well known, Trident is by Robinso
Crusoe, a descendant of old Fisherman, from th
imported mare, Oocoanut. In colour he is a haze
■chestnut, with a small white stripe down th
forehead ; the near hind leg is also white from
just below the hock down to the hoof, and on th
near fore foot, too, a small circle of white hair i
visible. When a yearling, Trident was sold a
Newmarket, Victoria, at the October sales hel
by Messrs. W. C. Yuille and Co., the purchase
of the colt being his present owner, the Hon. Jas
White, who secured him at the extremely low
.figure of 800 guineas. His first appearance
public was at the Randwiok Summer meeting
1885, wherein he foretold his goodness by comfort
ably winning the Christmas Gift—a weight-for
.age event run over the ten-furlong course, hi
immediate followers being Kathleen, and that
.sterling good filly, Crossfire. Journeying, t
Flemington we next find him running third t
Maddelina in the Sires’ Produce Stakes, six fur
longs; and subsequently second to the sam
smart filly in the All Aged Stakes over th
mile course. The colt’s defeat twice in sue
•cession by Maddelina did not impress close ob
servers of Derby aspirants with any too much
confidence in Trident, the almost unanimou
opinion being that he could not ripen into a stayer
But in justice to him it may here be stated than
during his sojourn at Flemington he was subjected
.to rather severe treatment by the farrier
which necessitated his being confined to
his loose-box for over a week. This un
fortunate circumstance of course interfered with
his preparation, and at one time Mr. Fennelly
.despaired of getting him to the post at all; luckily
however, the colt mended rapidly, and started in the
two events quoted above, but had everything pro
grossed favourably with him we are confident ii
the assertion that his winning record as a two
year-old would have been richer than it is, by two
points. At the conclusion of the V. R. C. Autumn
Meeting, Trident, in company with the Roger and
•Champion Race winner, Matchlock, and the re-
mainder of Mr. Fennelly’s charges, returned to
Rand wick. The Autumn meeting of the Austra
lian Jockey Club served to introduce the Derby
victor to our notice again, the event being
(the rich Sires’ Produce Stakes. It is now a matter
of history how Trident, without the support of the
stable—which pinned their colours to Acme-
swooped down and defeated another loose-box
companion in Tamarisk, together with the Queens
land-bred colt My Lord, Chesham, and others.
But he failed to concede ten pounds to Blairgowrie
in the Champagne Stakes, and finished unplaced
and only managed to secure third honours to the
pony-wonder, Cerise and Blue, in the All Aged
Stakes of one mile. Thus it will be seen that he
.started six times as a two-year-old, winning twice,
once second, third twice, and was once unplaced
—a most meritorious record. Independent
of the brilliant victory achieved by Trident on
Saturday, and his prospects of further success-
reference to which is made in another column—
the result has a particular charm for those of our
sporting community who delight to linger over
pedigrees. Neither is it confined to those only,
but the old school of race-goers will par-
ticipate in the enjoyment of a chat over the
doings at Randwick of Trident’s blood relations
in the ancestral line. Briefly referring to the latter,
it may be remarked as an item worthy of notice
that Robinson Crusoe, sire of Trident, was led
back to scale a winner of this self-same event in
1876, exactly 10 years ago ; while another of the
same family, Richmond, did similar performance
a year previously ; and in 1877 Woodlanas, also a
grandson of old Fisherman, perpetuated the name
by his brilliant overthrow of the mighty Chester.
Six years after Robinson Crusoe’s victory, his
black son, Navigator, appropriated the Derby for
Mr. De Mestre ; then again, in 1884, Tamarisk’s
half-brother, Bargo, a son of Maribyrnong, carried
the Hon. James White’s colours to victory. But
perhaps the most important, and at the same time
most sensational event annexed at Randwick by
any horse claiming Fisherman blood, was in 1867
when Fishhook, a full brother to Angler, and sire
of Trident, defeated Mr. John Tait’s wonderful
black horse, The Barb, in the St. Reger Stakes.
V'e well remember the excitement that prevailed
and the wordy warfare, accompanied by torrents
of abuse and innuendos that permeated the whole
racing community for the time being ; but any
further reference to them is not required here. A
few words only will suffice to prove the excellence
of Trident’s breeding. His dam, Cocoanut, was
bred in England in 1866, so that at the time she
produced Trident, she was in her seventeenth year;
while Robinson Crusoe had reached his
tenth year. The sire of Cocoanut was Nut-
boume, who was by The Nabob out of Prin-
cess, by the Merry Monarch, out of Queen Char-
lotte, and traces back to the bluest of blue-blood
strains. If any further proof were required of the
value of Cocoanut’s strain, we may, in drawing
this brief notice to a conclusion, point out for the
benefit of breeders that Winterlake, the sire of the
South Australian-bred mare Sandal (unhappily
both are now defunct), was also by Nutbourne,
from Whitefaoe, whose dam, Nan Darrell, was a
grand-daughter of Blaoklock, while Miss Vivian,
dam of Cocoanut, was a grand-daughter of Sir
Hercules (by Whalebone) and Evasion. Nothing
need he said of the sire.
The tabulated pedigree of Trident will be
perused with interest by searchers for and admirers
of a highly-bred animal: —
The accompanying table shows the classical
events in which Trident is engaged during the
present racing season :
Favoured with “Darby Day” weather,
there was an unusually large concourse of specta-
tors within and without the Ka mi wick enclosures
on Saturday last. The whole surroundings were
seen at their best save that the lawn, although
not actually as bare as marble, did not wear that
verdant tinge we have been so accustomed to
meet with at Randwick race meetings, especially
on the opening day. We do not mind the running
track or carriage paddock; neither should we
object for one moment to walking about ankle-
deep in dust in our attempts to “take the book
makers down,” or be treated in the same gentle
operation ourselves. It is not our intention to
attempt to describe the dresses worn by the ladies.
We had made extensive and elaborate preparations
for so doing, but, in the language of heads of
racing establishments, we here exclaim : “That
we have been forestalled by the Sunday Times.”
We take the defeat, and frankly admit that the
flowery language introduced in their description
of Lady Carington’s rig-out is far beyond us, we
cannot get near it; we are distanced, we are dis-
graced, we are short-weight, we are disqualified ;
in fact, we are electrified, magnified, stupifled,
and expire gracefully.
* * *
The afternoon’s racing opened with the
time-honoured Hurdle Race, for which a
field of 15 started. We are willing to accept all
risks in stating that with the exception of one,
the actual winner, a more miserable field never
before possessed cheek enough to face the starter
and run for such a prize. Amongst the lot, too,
were the Victorian horses, Goodwood, Sultan, and
Buzza, neither of which could win a hurdle race
in their own country with as many pounds on
their backs as they were allotted stones here.
Goodwood, perhaps, is a trifle better than the rest,
for he has the redeeming feature of being able to
negotiate big timber ; that is ability enough to
win over Randwick with the fields that are met
with there as a rule. Buzza is entitled to sympa-
thy because he is a cripple, and never likely to be
anything else ; but even were he ever so sound
and well, hurdle-racing is not his game. We
were surprised to see old Belle Brandon finish so
near the front —indeed we cannot solve the con-
nundrum how she got round at all, for she stripped
a wreck only of her former self. Caloola’s vic-
tory, or rather Caloola’s trot round the course
and over the hurdles, should, at any rate, con-
vince the Messrs. Lee that they made a grave
error in not having a cut in for the Grand
National Hurdle Race at Melbourne in July. We
save always held the opinion, and still hold it,
that Caloola is the very best hurdle racehorse in
Australia at the present moment. Admirers of
The Agent are loud in their expressions of belief
as to his infallibility with anything at level
weights, but we are more than sceptical of his
ability to defeat Caloola. Probably it has never
yet struck those admirers of the handsome little
chesnut, that in all his contests he has
never yet met anything many steps above
mediocrity, with the exception of Sheet
Anchor and Gasalier. The former will not
jump hurdles, but the latter ran him to a
length in a weight for age event at Fiemington.
The Trial Stakes was so much wrecked that
out of an original entry of twenty only nine cried
content when the summons-bell to weigh out was
rung. We were very favourably impressed with
the action of the brown colt Blue Blood, who,
however, requires time to mature. The Wreck
was installed a warm favourite, and should have
won easily enough had any judgment been used
in piloting him. As it was, however, it appeared
to beatussle between the colt and thocoxswain, and
the colt prevailing when once in the straight his
chance of victory was wrecked —and so were the
backers. No doubt the colt is a very difficult one to
ride, and on this account there is some excus
for the boy. A word of praise is due youn
Huxley, brother to the deceased jockey, for his
riding of Neophyte. The stable were not at a
sweet upon their chance of winning, and allowei
the filly to go out unbacked, but the public fol
lowed the colours and landed their dollars.
* * *
Important an event as the Derby was, r;
can be described in a few words. It was simply
Trident first, the rest nowhere. Such was the
actual result, although Blairgowrie and King
fish were second and third; and should th
stable decide to stand the same colt for th
Y.R.C., Derby, and make up their minds to sup
port him for a substantial stake—which no doub
they will do —their acceptance of even money
about his winning is wholy and solely due to th
exhibition Hales made of his field at the finish
We shall not be surprised if the books asked 2 an
3 to 1 on Trident if he sees the post, and, as
matter of fact, it resolves itself into that question
it is not 7 to 6 against Trident for the V.R.C
Derby, it is simply 7 to 6 against Trident going t
the post. We feel justified in remarking tha,
Hales miscalculated the future position of the col
in the betting-market by winning so easily. Had
he been satisfied with a half-length, or even
length win, the books would have been induces
to pencil against him at something like reasonable
odds ; but now the murder is out —they are
pretty shrewd school, and nothing will convince
them that anything else has a thousand to one
show of defeating Trident. Yet we can hardly
blame Hales for erring on the right side
for the reason that his past experience has taugh ,
him that waiting for his stable-companion to come
back to him too often proves disastrous
* * »
Blairgowrie’s trainer stated publicly that
he would run the distance in 2min. 405e0., oi
under, and he was quite right, as the colt go,
home a trifle under 2min. Exception has
been taken by some people, who profess to be
judges, to Robertson’s horsemanship. They say
that Blairgowrie was pulling his head off fron
the start to the five-furlong post, and that Alec
should have indulged him a little. For our part
we think that Robertson rode him without fault
and respecting his final effort, we never saw him
to better advantage. But it is just possible tha
the pockets and not the opinions were speaking.
* * *
We are not alone in the opinion that the,
noblest looking Roman of the quintette was the
well-bred Kingfish; and if a Divine Providence
purposes upsetting the calculations of Christiai
backers, and once more asserting that the yid-
dishers are the chosen race, this is the channe
through which the said delivery must come. But
Kingfish is terribly backward in condition, anc.
requires bustling along in real earnest to be ready
for the Y.R.C. Derby. He ran an excellent race
on Saturday last, and it was condition only, pure
and simple, that enabled Blairgowrie to deprive
him of second money. Of his gameness their can
be no doubt whatever, and even at this period we
prophesy that Kingfish’s defeat of Blairgowrie in
the Y.R.C. Derby is as certain as is Trident’s
absolute victory.
* * *
The two last events on the programme cal
for no special comment beyond the fact that in the
Spring Stakes Crossfire split her hoof, and Trenton
pulled up dreadfully lame. The feature of the
Welter Handicap was the performance of Meteor,
who, with the crusher of lOst. fibs, in the saddle,
ran a great second to Industry with 7st. That
Meteor would have won had he been able to get
through his field every person present will admit,
and it must also be borne in mind that half-a-mile
from home he hurt his shoulder ; and to add still
further to his troubles the bridle came off below
the Legcr Stand. It is a thousand pities such a
really brilliant horse should meet with such an un-
fortunate accident, more especially at this time of
the year when so many rich prizes were within
his grasp. We were also anxiously looking for-
ward to his meeting Trident in the Melbourne
Cup in which the pair would have had a hard
struggle for mastery. But our hopes and our cash
are scattered to the wind.
* ’ *
After Trident’s creditable victory in the
Derby on Saturday enquires were made about him
for the more important V.R.C. event. No money
was obtainable, of course, and it would be highly
interesting to know what are the actual odds that
he does|nob repeat the Martini-Henry performance.
We have always maintained that a first-class
three-year-old has invariably the best of the
weights in the big two-mile race at Melbourne.
Last year it will be remembered that Nordenfeldt
got home for Sydney Derby with nothing in hand, and
at Melbourne he defeated First Chester by an eye-
lash. In the race for the Melbourne Cup he
finished close up fourth after being interfered
with all the way home, from the turn into the
straight running. If Nordenfeldt, who although
a consistent plodder, was not by any means a
brilliant horse, could get so near the front rank in
the fastest run two-mile Cup on record in Austra-
lia, what must Trident’s prospects of success be
worth 1 On the other hand, it will be well for
backers and layers not to allow the Bargo affair
to escape their notice.
* * *
The meeting held last week by the Austra-
lian Jockey Club to consider the question of early
two-year-old racing terminated, as we anticipated
it would, in nothing being done. With the ex-
ception of our legislators we never listened to a
worse lot of debaters, both pro. and con.
Mr. Henry Austin, the mover (as far as
the public know) in the affair, utterly failed to
prove his case. He produced nothing to show
that what he wanted done was worth doing. No
statistics, in fact, nothing at all but a conceived
notion, happily restricted to a very few, that
buyers of yearlings shall not do what they like with
their own property. Mr. Austin would have shown
to better advantage had he informed the meeting
of his intention to lay out a few thousand pounds
in yearling stock and not race them until they
were three-year-olds.
* * *
Was it bad luck, or bad judgment ? Mr.
W. Cooper was once the owner of Lord William
and sold him to William Duggan, the trainer.
Directly the colt changed hands, he won a race at
Rosehill. Mr. W. Cooper sold Cairo in Melbourne
for £75, and purchased Solo in this colony for
something like £4OO. The first time the pair met
at Randwick Cairo proved the winner. Mr. W,
Cooper gave £2325 for Trenton a month or two
ago. The first time the big gun meets the cast-of f
two-year-old the latter runs a dead-heat with
Crossfire, and Trenton hobbles in last as lame as
the proverbial cat.
* * *
We regret to learn from M. O’Brien, the
popular and accomplished professional horseman,
that he does not intend riding in any races at Du-
pre sent meeting of the A.J.C. Although looking
well he has not recovered from the effects of his
fall from Rapid recently at Randwick.
In our happy ignorance we rejoiced in the
belief that the Victorian Selling Plater, Mabel
Gray, recently purchased by Joe Thompson, be-
longed to the “ weaker ” sex. But we are wrong
if the Melbourne Sportsman (what’s in a name)
be correct. In describing a race ran at the last
Moonee Valley meeting, the beautiful Mabel is
returned as a “ b.g.,” which we take it means
bay gelding. But really that is nothing out of
the way for the Melbourne Sportsman, for it is
on record in the same journal from the pen of the
corpulent “ Vigilant ” that L. L. Smith’s horse,
“ Dougalston, was added to the list, and put to
the stud.” What a happy coincidence. Let us
suggest that the b.g., Mabel Gray, and the added
to the list, Dougalston, be mated ; the pair might
jointly assist in producing a youngster that would
astonish the universe.
Not a Metrop. crowd by any means ap-
peared at Randwick on Tuesday last to see the
big money run for. Possibly the weather was in
some degree answerable for this, as clouds ominous
of rain drifted through the sky at noon; still
weather apart, the attendance was not so great
as might reasonably have been expected. Only
one shower fell during the afternoon, and it was
not much more than sufficient to lay the
dust. The 12,000 or so who did venture out
were well repaid for their trouble, as each
of the three best finishes of the after-
noon were alone worth going out to see.
The big race plunged most of the Sydney con-
tingent into deep mourning, for Bohemian was
not much supported by sports hailing from this
side of the border. The Jewel’s backers had but
little reason to blame their judgment or to censure
the performance of their favourite, for the finish
between the Jewel and Bohemian was one of the
best this race has ever produced. Coming clear
away from their field at the distance the pair
settled down to a regular Beach-Gaudaur struggle,
and had not the Jewel changed legs in the last
few strides the verdict would probably have been
in his favour. New South Welshmen may find
some consolation for the fact that the stakes go to
Victoria in the consideration that Bohemian (who
is by Maribyrnong from Nina, by Kingston from
Ghiva, by Velocity from Atalanta) was bred by
Mr. Andrew Town, of Hobartville, near Rich-
mond, and is, therefore, a N.S.W. horse in all but
the essential point of present ownership. Another
desperate finish was the dead-heat between that
constant filly Crossfire, andtheHon. James White’s
Tamarisk, Acme the third starter, who cut out the
running in the early part of the journey, being
third, ten lengths away. Yetman only managed
to get home a neck ahead of Matador in the Rich-
mond Stakes, the favourite Sumatra, who was the
last to leave the post, running into fourth place.
Corday beat Myall King by two lengths in the
Squatters’ Handicap; My Lord, a hot favourite,

An English paper having railed at Queen
Victoria for having practically turned Presbyterian
and received the Communion from a Dissenter, a
Scotchman writes to the editor : —“ The Queen
must be a Protestant, but not by any means an
Episcopalian, hence, when here, she may—indeed,
ought to—give the Presbyterians a turn, and when
she does she is not receiving the Communion from
a Dissenter, but the Established Church. It is
vour aristocratic Anglican Church that is the
Dissenter in Scotland. Presbyterianism is not all
it should be, but I have yet to learn tha t it is in-
ferior to the Anglican Church which, in my opinion
is the most rotten institution under heaven,
Presbyterians don’t buy and sell livings like pigs
at an auction, nor do they pay Bishops £15,000 a
year for doing little, and give their hard-working
curate the pay of a journeyman blacksmith ; nor
do they accept Protestant State Pay and preach
Popery, nor are they such ignoramuses as to allow
one Clergyman to hold three livings atsay £l,OOO
each, live on the Continent, and pay three curates
£lOO a year each for doing his work, nor do we
believe in Apostolic succession ! The idea of your
coach-and-four and footmen-and-flunkey-attended
Bishops being the successors of the poor fisher-
men ! No, sir ! we may be ignoramuses in some
things, but we cannot believe that.”

WILLIAM WILKINS—A BALLAD OF LOVE
AND MONEY
William Wilkins was a merchant, one who pros-
pered very well ,
By mixing foreign matter with the goods he had to
sell: , . . „
He ran a store in Sydney, did the subject ol oui
rhyme, ~
The date’s of no importance—it was once upon
a time.”
The merchant, deep in commerce, ever piling up
the pelf, ,
Had treasured up this maxim, and applied it o
himself : , ,
“ No man should ever marry till he s getting on in
lif e •”
So, at something after fifty, William thought about
a wife.
He was earnest in this matter, as in all he under-
(For ne'er a man in Sydney better understood his
book),
Mrs. Wilkins, he determined, should be every-
thing that’s nice—
The very best obtainable in ladies at the price.
After many reconnoitres in the theatres and
arcades, „ ~
Quong Tart’s and other places where assemble
pretty maids, , . ~
Our William felt persuaded that the nicest girl he d
Was a dainty pet rejoicing in the name of Mary
Green.
Oh, the merry eye of Mary ! it was full of fun and
Her ankle, too, was all the keenest critic could
desire ;
The heart of William Wilkins very soon was m a
blaze, _ .... , ,
And he started mashing Maryjm a multitude of
ways.
Now, a wealthy single merchant, you will gener-
ally find,
Can make a deep impression on the simple spin-
ster mind ; .
So we wonder not that Mary, m a very little
while, ...
Learned to show her teeth at William in a modest
maiden smile.
He called her “popsy-wopsy,” “lovey-dovey,”
“ pretty thing,”
He always fetched her music when she sat her
down to sing, .
And when at length he ventured on a ponderous
caress
She referred him to her mother, with a hesitating
“ Yes.”
Then a happy swain was William, and a happy
girl was she
(As all engag-ed couples are —or, rather, ought to
t)G)
The hours seemed but moments as the bridal day
drew near,
When —pardon us |for pausing while wo, chase
a briny tear—
The merchant, foolish fellow ! brought his'Mary
down one day, , . .
And showed her round warehouse in a patronis-
ing way 1 - ‘ ’ &
She was looking fat the fixtures, and expressing
her surprise, _ . .
When she saw a smart assistant with a pair ot
wicked eyes.
That dashing young assistant J,’ twas’ as Mr. Noah
Jinks,
His master introduced him) gave her many loving
winks, !
And all regard forJWilli m 4 her fickle oosom
fled — „
Mary formed a sudden .fancy for, the other map
mstead.^’
Thought Mary, “What a’”pir~ that to William
I’m engaged, „
For Noah looks much nicer andjie s not so nuddle-
The very type of fe ow it'were ecstas to mash —
I’d marry him to-morrow, if it wasn’t for the
cash.’j _
The old ’un never “tumbled” what was passing
in her mind, .
For love, as poets tell us, is invariably blind ,
Her manner seemed more tender than it ever yet
had been —
Oh, an artful little fairy was this merry Mary
Green!
But, ere a week was over, she had hit upon a
scheme
By means of which she realised her sentimental
dream.
She coyly said to Wilkins—“lf your passion is
sincere.
You’ll settle on your Mary (say) a thousand pounds
a year.”
« My darling,” he responded, “it is done as soon
as said ;
I’ll bring you home the document the day before
we wed —
To let you see, my pansy, what a lot I thin of
you,
Instead of just a thousand, we will make it into
two.”
Said Mary, “ Make it over to me in my maiden
name;” .
The poor old boy consented, never dropping to
her game;
Young Noah got a billet clonx that very afternoon
Which said, “Be true. All’s well. Prepare to
have a honeymoon.”
The lawyer drew the settlement, which William
Wilkins signed,
And handed to Miss Mary, who remarked,
“You’re very kind,
To-morrow I’ll be wedded to the darling I
adore” —
William never once suspected wdiat the future
held in store.
The marriage-morn ofjMary dawned beautiful and
She putfon’ orange-blossoms 'and a bridal dress of
white; >• - ‘khm . •
Then— having told a story fetojfher mystified

LADIES OF SYDNEY.
TT behoves every thrifty housewife to
look to the future, in order if pos-
sible to
SAVE MONEY.
It is a well-known fact that a large in-
crease has occurred in the price of wool at
home, and it is only to be expected that
prices of Woollen Goods will bo higher
next winter than they are this ; so that if
any of you will be requiring
NEW BLANKETS
next winter, how much better to buy them
now, and save the inevitable increase in
price.
Those who have bought blankets from
this winter know what excellent value we
have been giving, and we feel sure that if
you do so also you will never regret it.
OUR PRICES ARE—
4s. lid., Ss. 6d., 6s. 6d., 7s. lid., Bs. 6d.,
10s. 6d., 12s. 6d., 14s. 6d., 15s. 6d.,
18s. 6d., 205., 255., 305., and
up to 50s. a pair.

Le Fellet says: — A novel invention in Corsets admirably calculated to
prevent the very disagreeable occurrence of split seams. The cut is very
good and becoming, and may be adapted to any figure with advantage.”
The Queen says: —“ These Corsets are a new departure. The material is
cut on the cross, and the component parts being also arranged diagonally,
the seams have no strain. They are admirably modelled, exquisitely neat
and strong, and the workmanship all that could be desired.” Caution. —Beware of worthless imitations.
Every genuine Y & N Corset is stamped “ Y & N Patent Diagonal Seam Corset, No. 116,” in oval.

HA'
WILL convince you ol the wonder-
ful curative properties combined in
Dr. Bell’s Bitters, if the remarkable
cures that have been effected by its use fail to impress
mind this repeatedly proven fact. Thous-
and all declare that
possessing all and
we claim for it. My
ands are using it,
it is a medicine
more than
even
friend, if you are sick, or in that condition that you
cannot call yourself either sick or well, go and get a
bottle of Dr. Bell’s Bitters, and realise yourself how
this medicine hits the
right spot, and puts all
the machinery of your
body into working order.
One of our prominent business men said to us the
other day : “ In the spring my wife got all run down
and could not eat anything ; passing a store I saw a
lot of Dr. Bell’s Bitters in the win. -low, and I got a
bottle. After she had been taking it a week she had
a rousing appetite, and it did her a world of good.
She took three bottles, and it was the best investment
ever made.”
DO YOU KNOW
That the very best Blood Purifier and Spring Medi-
cine is Dr. Bell’s Bitters.
That it cures Biliousness, Indigestion, Dyspepsia.
Headache, and Kidney and Liver Complaints.
That it is a wonderful medicine for Restoring and
sharpening the Appetite.
That it cures Scrofula, Salt Rheum, Boils, Pimples,
or other Diseases of the Blood.
If you suffer from any of these affections, try Dr.
Bell’s Bitteis at once.
Dr. Bell’s Bitters as a Blood Purifier has no equal.
It tones the system, strengthens and invigorates,
giving new life.
The highest Medical Authorities pronounce it the
only known Specific for Kidney, Liver and Urinary
Diseases; that it has no equal as a BLOOD PURIFIER,
that it is the best safeguard against Contagious
Diseases, both acute and chronic keeping the KID
NEYh and LIVE —the great organs of the body-
in healthy condition, disease then being impossible.
WILL
CONVINCE
Note. —Any poor Person, or the manager of any
Hospital, Asylum, or O d People’s Home, may obtain
the Bitters gratuitously upon written application

of the i .ospel, certifying that they are unable to pa;,
for medicine.
