THE SPIRIT OF HOSPITALITY
Hospitality provides the privilege of making others happy. It is quite an art
in itself capable of showing the very soul of man. Hospitality can ring false
or sound a note as truly genuine as the ever-welcome merits of

The Red Page
To Sappho Smith
[“Sappho Smith” was the pen-name of the little
lady who was first in charge of The Bulletin’s “A
Woman’s Letter.” “Nora McAulift'e” is the pen-
name of the lady who sits in the same chair to-day.]
LEGEND, that tells you had a ready wit,
For once speaks truth.
I leading the fading pages now I sit
And glimpse your youth.
That you were small with fascinating hands
And tiny feet,
And, in the fashion of the “cultured” lands,
Your waist was neat:
Such meagre points I love to conjure with,
And fashion you again, gay Sappho Smith
1 wonder what your dreams were in the days
When Sydney streets
Were thronged by leisured elegants at gaze
From hansom seats.
When, face alight beneath your coy “gem"
hat,
You did the Block,
Your eyes were quick to see and sadden at
Things beyond mock.
Quick laughter is the balm Fate soothes
us with,
Whom life wounds all; too deeply, Sappho
Smith!
Once on a day when all the air was soft
With recent rain,
And a tall jaearanda blazed aloft,
Through the Domain,
Did you walk moulding ’neatli the Morcton
Bays
The Fame to be?
While swift and sure the last of all your
days
Drew speedily.
And, fashioning the jest to hand you with
Across the chasm, Death came, Sappho
Smith!
Sometimes I feel you whisking up the stair
- Through the half gloom.
And see you smile and quiz my shingled
hair
As in my room,
With lifted brows, you touch my fountain-
pen
And muse its sway,
For it must write a round of things and
men
Born since your day.
But if it ran with half the wit and pith
That pointed yours, I'd shrine it, Sappho
Smith !

Collaboration
“How’s the play going?” I asked my actor-
scribble* 1 friend Royston when I met him
yesterday on the Point. He had given me
thrilling details of the scheme when lie had
just started collaborating with Carker,. the
flourishing journalist and short-story writer,
on the drama which was to be a world-
beater, bringing each a comfortable fortune,
and I was naturally interested. Australia
badly wants a native play and playwrights,
and Royston’s enthusiasm at the prospect
was infectious; calculated, I felt sure, to
win over the most sceptical of our theatrical
managers. And that is saying a great deal.
Royston surprised me by, thrusting his
underlip out—a habit of his when he feels
riled—and saying in a tragic voice, “The
play is off. laddie.”
“Off!” I echoed disappointedly. “When,
how, why?”
“Carker and I quarrelled,” said my friend
shortly.
“By .Jove, I am sorry to hear it. What
about?”
“Oh, literary collaboration is a thing that’s
not so darned simple as it looks. If both
authors can't agree over the details of their
joint work, obviously they must chuck it.”
“And you differed?”
“We agreed too well—if you can under-
stand that —but finally agreed to differ and
let 'the play slide.”
“Pity,” I murmured sympathetically.
“Yes. A sure'goldmine that play would
have been if we had written it as I wanted
it written. I’ll tell you what happened. The
story was Carker’s, I give him that credit;
but the construction of the piece was to be
left in my hands, my knowledge of the back
of the stage entitling me to have the big
say there. Well, I had it up to a certain
point. We were in the middle of the first
act and going along all right, Carker and I
working together as jolly as two sandboys.
Then one night he suddenly wanted a cer-
tain situation altered; it would give him
a chance for a particularly fine bit of writ-
ing, life said. He was always talking about
his writing, as if words alone were going ,to
make the piece.
“We started to argue it out. I had
planned that the villain was .to come into
the room just as the erring wife is being
cross-questioned by the husband, a very jeal-
ous individual. His entry is seen by the
wife, but the husband has his back turned
to the door. The villain, not knowing that
a convenient mirror has given his presence
away to the husband, hides behind a screen.
The wife, who has been on the point of con-
fessing her relations with the heavy gentle-
man, now attempts to shield him. The furi-
ous hubby, a crack shot, then whips out
a revolver and threatens that unless she
tells him all he will shoot. Not at her, but
at the screen. See the point? The woman,
at bay, attempts prevarication, and uses
every means in her power to put him off his
purpose. No good. He levels his revolver
at the screen. She frenziedly rushes to-
wards it. and by accident knocks it over.
The villain lies crumpled up on the Hour —
lie has died of fright! Great, eh? My own
original idea for the end of the act. No-
thing like it has over been seen on the Stage.
“But Carker wanted it altered. ' Said it
would be better if the wife was behind the
screen while the husband wrung the truth
from the villain. It would make the situa-
tion much stronger, he said. 1 couldn’t
agree to that—it sounded ridiculous. Fancy
killing your heroine off like that in the first
act of your play! Carker asked, why not?
‘She was a bad lot, anyhow,’ he said, and : t
was novelty he was after. All these moth-
eaten devices were nowadays taboo with the
best dramatists and we must go with the
times. The idea was to twist the old stuff
about so that it looked like new. Why.
plays were being written at the present time
without any women in them at all, he argued.
We had better kill our heroine off and con-
centrate thereafter on the male interest.
"Then, of course, we had a dust-up.
Friendly enough, though we were both a
bit hot at the finish. 1 had prided myself
on inventing a strong scene and 1 wasn't
going to have my work interfered with.
Carker said the scene would be every bit as
strong the Way he wanted it and he saw his
chance to put in some fine writing. I told
him that the scene didn’t need fine writing;
that the tense dramatic action would be suf-
ficient to carry it. Then lie said 1 had
better go home and think it over, as he
wouldn’t touch his pen again till the matter
was decided. And I told him he had better
do the same, and we parted.
"I couldn’t get flic thing out of my head.
It kept me awake best part of the night.
That Carker should presume to think he
knew more about putting a play together
than 1 did hurt me most. It was his plot,
of course, but a plot can't be shoved into
dramatic shape except by a skilled crafts-
man. Anyhow, we had agreed on the
scenario I had written. Why mess it about
and waste time?
“But a very strange thing happened. I
thought the situation over and over again—
heroine vermin villain, villain versus heroine
—before I finally dropped off. And then I
dreamed about it. And, would you believe
it? —when I woke in the morning I was con-
verted to Carker’s idea of the scene. He had
got the right notion, after all. It would un-
doubtedly be more novel to get rid of the
heroine in the way he suggested, and another
female character to take her place could be
introduced if wanted. I would agree .with
my collaborator's suggestion, and we would
get on with the job.
“Full of the theme I rushed round to
Carker’s place immediately after breakfast,
eager to tell him that he had won me over,
but wondering all the same what sort of a
reception I should get. He was all smiles
and amiability; Tioyston,’ old man, ‘he
said, ‘l’m glad you’ve come. I was just going
to give you a ring. I want to apologise for
my stupid behavior last night. 1 have been
thinking over our talk about that scene in
Act i, and I’ve come to the conclusion that
you were emphatically right and 1 was
wrong. We dare not get rid of our heroine
and we should get rid of the villain —he’d
only be an infernal nuisance. So there need
be no more said on the subject.’
“He fairly knocked me over. I ask you,
what is the good of collaborating with a man
who doesn’t know his own mind two days
together?
“'Carker,’ I said, ‘listen to me for a
moment. I have come round to say that I
have considered the matter in all its aspects
and there is now no doubt in my mind that
I was wrong and you were right. Kill the
woman, my boy! It will be newer than my
way and we can reconstruct the rest of the
piece in the manner you suggested. It will
be fascinating to me to ,work the plot out on
those fresher lines. So all we have got to
do is- to fix the situation and start afresh
from there.’
“Then Carker got mulish. ‘No.’ said he,
‘I don’t want to write the whole darned
thing again. I have put some of my best
work into it. Let us go on exactly as we
were going. I made a mistake when I sug-
gested the alteration and I’ve told you so.’
“Then I thought it time to assert myself.
‘The reconstruction necessary,’ I said, ‘will
entail more work than the actual dialogue.
But I’ll take it on cheerfully 'and I see my
way to make a good job of it. And look
here, Carker, if you don’t fall in with my
ideas I’ll retire and have no more to do with
the play.’ That threat would have ■ some
effect, I thought. It had, but not what I
anticipated.
“ 'Very well. Royston,’ said Carker, ’that
settles it. You evidently want to have it
all your own way. But I will not be a
party to spoiling the piece, so I turn the
whole thing up. I’m through, you under-
stand. I couldn't think of working any
longer with such a pigheaded collaborator.
As ii matter of fact, collaboration is not a
damned bit of good to me. I prefer to do
my work in my own way.' Before I could
stop him he took up the MS. of the play
from the table and tore it up into little
bits. I put on my hat and made a quick
exit and I haven’t seen Carker since.
"That's the end of it. Yes. it is a terrible
pity, for that piece would have been the
biggest hit ever known in Australia.”
EARDLEY TURNER.
Why God Invented Morphia
Coming in to dun me for an overdue sub-
scription, the union secretary picked up In
Our Time, the latesf of the Jonathan ('ape
story series, and read a couple of sentences.
“Great Stuff,” he commented. “Realism.”
“Have you read it?" I said, hoping he might
forget what lie came for. “No,” he admitted.
■‘Two-pounds-five. isn't it? Could you let
me have thirty boh of it?” We compromised
on five shillings. In our time union secre-
taries do that sort of thing. ... It is the sort
of thing union secretaries do in our time. . . .
When in our time union secretaries do that
sort of thing we are grateful.... We are
grateful that union secretaries do that sort
of thing in our time. ...
The morphia! Quick! Ah, that’s better!
Before I have another attack I want to
thank God for morphia, it is almost as
effective as suicide and not so risky. Now,
while I am feeling better, I turn to the pub-
lisher’s explanation of the story series: "A
series which aims at encouraging the read-
ing and writing of first-rate short stories.
By offering authors an opportunity to issue
their short stories in volume, form it is
thought that the art of short-story writing
will be encouraged.” As the term is used,
in plural and singular, three times in the
first two sentences I feel justified in believ-
ing that short stories are what the publisher
is after. At any rate no mention is made
that the series might include acrostics,
riddlc-me-rces or Euclidics. and, accordingly,
I feel that I have a case against Mr. Jona-
than Cape for false representation in rc
Ernest Hemingway versmu Anything That
Resembles a Short Story.
Your Honors, I waive my right to submit
that the performance of a Caesarian opera-
tion with a jack-knife in a bottom bunk while
the father of the child cuts his throat in the
top bunk and lets the blood drip through on
to the unconscious mother —I repeat, your
Honors, I waive my right to submit that
that is dunghill writing of the thirtieth
stratum. Nor shall I press the point that a
horse’s intestines hanging in a blue bunch
from his gored belly, no matter how much
they may delight literary blowflies, arc not
a subject for fiction photography. Nor yet
again, your Honors, shall I ask you to follow
the paroxysms of a child sitting in the sand
vomiting. These are a few of the matters
which someone with a weaker stomach than
mine might wish to plead in rc Ernest Hem-
ingway v. Decency. We are not concerned
here, I might remind your Honors, with the
dirty and sordid exposure of filth which is
coming to be a synonym for Realism.
I should like also to remind your Honors
that the case listed is not Ernest Heming-
way v. The English Language. Therefore,
this sort of thing does not affect my plea
Mrs: Elliot was quite sick. She was sick, and
when she was sick she was sick as Southern women
are sick.
However gratified your Honors may feel
that Mrs. Elliot whs sick, I am sure you
will find greater cause for gratification in
this matter of Nick and the can of apricots:
While he waited for the coffee to boil he opened
a small can of apricots. He liked to open cans.
He emptied the can of apricots out into a tin cup.
While he watched the coffee on the fire he drank
the juicy syrup of the apricots, carefully at first to
keep from spilling, then meditatively sucking' the
apricots down. They were better than fresh apricots.
It may be worth while to direct tin' atten-
tion of your Honors to the fact that they
do these things better in the . States than
we do. I mean they can apricots better.
That is, your Honors, if you open a can of
canned apricots you are almost certain to
find canned apricots inside the can to prove
Jliat it is a can of apricots.
Morphia, for the love of Heaven!
Now. your Honors, in re Ernest Heming-
way v. Anything That Resembles a Short
Story. I should like to submit this com-
plete short story from Mr. Hemingway’s
short stories in the story series. It is the
shortest of Mr. Hemingway’s stories. The
shortest of Mr. Hemingway's stories, it is
typical in plot, manner, atmosphere and con-
struction of the other stories in Mr. Heming;
way’s book of short stories in, the story
series * —
In 1919 he was travelling on the railways in
Italy, carrying a square of oilcloth from the head-
quarters of the party written in indelible pencil and
saying here was a comrade who had suffered very
much under the Whites in Budapest, and requesting
comrades to aid him in any way. He used thi-
instead of a ticket. He was very shy and quite
young, and the train men passed him on from one
crew to another. He had no money and they fed
him behind the counter in railway eating-houses.
He was delighted with Italy. It was a beautiful
country, he said. The people were all kind. He
had been in many towns, walked much, and seen
many pictures. Giotto, Masaccio and Piero della
Francesca he bought reproductions of and carried
them wrapped in a copy of Avanti. Mantegna he
did not like.
He reported at Bologna, and I took him with
me up to the Romagna, where I had to go to sec
a man. We had a good trip, together. It was
early September and the country was pleasant. He
was a Magyar, a very nice boy and very shy.
Horthy’s men had done some bad things to him.
He talked about it a little. In spite of Hungary,
he believed altogether in the world revolution.
“But how is the movement going in Italy?” he
asked.
“Very badly,” 1 said.
“But it will go better," he said. “You ha\.
everything here. It is the one country that everyone
is sure of. It will be the starting-point of every-
thing.”
1 did not say anything.
At Bologna he said good-bye to us to go on tin
train to Milano and then to Aosta to walk oyer tie
pass into Switzerland. I spoke to him about tin
Mantegnas in Milano. “No,” lie said, very shyly,
he did not like Mantegnas. I wrote out tor him
where to eat in Milano and the addresses of comrade-.
He thanked me very much, but his mind was already
looking forward to walking over the pass. He was
very eager to walk .over the pass while the weather
held good. He loved the mountains in the aUtumr.
The last I heard of him the Swiss had him in gaol
near Sion.
Your Honors, I submit that if that is ;i
short story, the King of Belgium is a banana.
But. in that it has a beginning and an end.
it is closer to being a story than most of
the other .14 fragments that lie above and
below it. In short, there isn't one short
story in Mr. Hemingway's book of short
stories in the story series. Nor is there a
long story. In “The Three-day Blow" Nick
and Bill drink all the opened whisky in tin-
house, discuss books and matrimony, gel
drunk and go out: shooting. In tin- 2000-odd
words of “Soldier's Home” Kreb’s mother
suggests that it's time ho got work; In- tells
her he doesn't love her and goes and watches
his sister play indoor baseball. In “Mr. ami
Mrs. Elliot” the pair so named want to have
a baby; Mr. Elliot writes long poetry ami
sells it; they do not have a baby. In “Big
Two-hearted River,” a six or seven-thousaml-
word “story” in two parts, Nick goes fishing,
catches a couple of trout and cleans them.
There are 10 others, mostly worse.
On the piTge following the table of contents
appears this in italics :
A (4irL in Chicago: “Tell us about the
French women, llank. What are they like!"
Bill Smith : “How old arc the French
women, Hank?' 1
I quote that particularly.' your Honors,
because I have discovered its meaning—it
means that French women are not going ro
be mentioned in any of the stories; If you
want to know what they're like, you can go
and ask Hank.
Exactly what the other ravings in italics,
which are sandwiched between the fragments
and called chapters, arc intended to mis-
represent in the story series I shall leave to
the honorary interpreter of tin- Gladesville
Asylum, who is my first witness. He also
has read Mr. Hemingway's book, btit, through
professional causes, he has not my fervent
need to thank God for morphia. I take it
that God invented morphia. Why He in-
vented morphia I do not know. I do not
know why God invented morphia.
CECIL MANN.
In the Cathedral
A DIM cathedral and a peal of bells,
And in the hush that follows, one
who tells
The guests assembled in expectant crowd
The secret of our love so high and proud.
Yet it perforce must be. Custom demands
That you should take in yours my nervous
hands.
And swear the marriage vows of sanctity
For love that is, and love that yet will be.
But, oh, how strange it seems ! What have
the tears
Of other women, or their smiles and fears,
To do with aught that touches you and mo
In this great moment of our destiny?....
I sense .our guests together whispering
Over some small, divinely foolish thing
We said or did when, chancing on my cheek
Against your shoulder, we were forced to
speak
Of that which you and I had set apart
In the. seclusion of each other's heart.
To-day we are world-sanctioned. We have
kissed
Before an altar’s- rose and amethyst;
Upon my linger shines a slim gold ring,
And, at my feet, a thousand blossoms fling
Their fragile petals down the shadowy aisle
Where, hand upon your arm, I *walk and
smile.
Though to this day were fashioned all our
dreams,
O my beloved, still lfow strange it seems!
As though our love itself had not the whole
Of marriage shining in its heart and soul!

NEW ROYAL MAIL
STEAMERS
(Fitted with Every Modern
Convenience).

and England.
*T-*HE three new Australia Mail Steamers of the Cathay
1 class — Cathay, Comorin, Oft»*roZ—have now all com
Dieted several voyages in. the service foi which
were specially designed. Although the " suceess was
never in doubt, the confidence m tlieir futuie proves to have
commissioned in Morel,, tl.e Comorin in
April ond the CKb'ol in duly. 1925. To
fortnightly service between London and Australia * ,
number of nine ships of equal speed is accessary
to the N older a and Narkunda, Moldavia and Mongolia and the
Maloja and Mooltan, the three new vessels have bi ought
P. & O. service to pre-war strength and frequency.
The Cathay, illustrated in this article, is of 15,000 tons gross .
her length, 545 feet; breadth, 70 feet; depth, 4b feet. Every
thing that can contribute to safety, comfort or convenience
been installed, including the most approved modernappaiatus
for handling boats; mechanically controlled watertight do -
and five large electric generating engines and dynamos toi tn
siinplv of current for lighting, cooking and heating A complete
automatic loud-speaking telephone system connects aj depart-
ments with the bridge and with each °. ther - J
machinery consists of quadruple-expansion balanced engines
designed to develop 13,000 i.li.p., served with steam from seven
boilers working at 2201 b. pressure, and burning oil .fuel under
forced option is prov ided on three decks for 208 first- and
108 second-saloon passengers in cabins with one, two or thre
berths, added to which there is berthing for 22 Xch cabin is
first-class bathroom suites or calnnes de luxe. Each cabin is
fitted with an electric radiator under the occupant s control.
Each passenger is provided with a wardrobe, and m the furnish
ing of the cabins generally the needs of the passenger have b _
carefully studied, even to the inclusion of an. direct
and bootrack. Every cabin is a porthole cabin, with direct
access of natural light and air. Amidships on each deck bath
rooms, on an ample scale, are installed, and the provision of a
fitted ironing-room in this ship (and others of the Company sfleet)
is a convenience likely to be much appreciated by women
travellers on long voyages.
The first-class public rooms, consisting of cardroom, lounge
and smoking-room, are placed amidships, midway m the vessel s
length, on the bridge deck. The cardroom is in the Adam style,
with panelled walls relieved by Wedgwood
able furniture, and carpets m shades of dark blue. Ihe lounge,
designed in the neo-Greek style, has Early Georgian furniture,
consisting of settees, easy chairs, writing and bridge tables
while rich rugs cover the polished parquet floor. A handsome
arched dome extends, fore and aft, over the room s entire len„t .
Perhaps the most pleasing of these rooms is the smoking-room.
Here a scheme in the Jacobean style has been carried out with
complete success. The walls are panelled all over m olive-tinted
oak, above which beams and rafters carry on the design, the
whole being set off by a broad open fireplace in brick. Adorn-
ing the walls are valuable steel engravings of portraits ot the
Jacobean period. The furniture is of the same period, and the
general result is unusually pleasing. A well-furnished veranda
cafe lies aft with direct access from the smoking-room.
On the upper deck the first dming-saloon whose roof is
supported by slender marble pillars, is simply decorated in tlie
Georgian style, enamelled all in shades of fawn, with artificially
shadowed mural dec,,ratio™ in relief. The fnrnitnre = t|
of restaurant tables for two or more passengers with anchored
Hepplewhite chairs in walnut, the latter copied from a \\anng
and Gillow design of the year 1779., This room, which is m
great size, extends through the ship s width and is natural y
lighted from each side by six curtained windows, each consisting
of large twin portholes, deeply recessed, giving a distinct >
dignified effect. On the same deck, farther aft with galleys
and service rooms between, is the second dining-saloon, furnislie
with restaurant tables of mahogany, and upholstered chairs ot
the same wood, the natural lighting arrangements being similar
to those in the first saloon.
An outstanding feature of this, as of all the new vessels,
is a novel, yet simple and thoroughly effective, system o
mechanical ventilation, ensuring a continuous supply ot tresli
air, which can be regulated at will, to all parts of the vessel.
The main promenade decks are of somewhat remarkable
extent, and the arrangement of these is likely to appeal especi-
ally to Australian travellers. A sheltered promenade, on the
deck below, encircles the second-class smoking-room (a gem ot
Jacobean reproduction) and the music-room; while there is, in
addition, a broad poop deck where, also, sports and games may
be enjoyed.
The projection and completion for the P. & 0. Mail Services
during the post-war years of upwards of 230,000. tons of the
most expensive kind of British shipping afloat has been a stu-
pendous undertaking, which has called for judgment and courage
of no mean degree. It is typical of the policy and pluck o
British shipowners. It is a challenge to fortune. But as a
making ready for any revival of the world s trade it is at t
same time a measure of the utmost prudence.
Lord Inclicape, in a message to the guests at a luncheon
on board the Cathay prior to her maiden departure, said that
passenger fares, in the face of production and operating costs
running, in some cases, to more than 100 per cent above the
pre-war level, were in the neighborhood of only 50 per cent,
above those ruling in 1914. In actual practice the passenger
was getting more for his money in the shape of increased
amenities, so that the moderate discrepancy between pre-war
and post-war passage rates was even less than mere statistics
would indicate. . , , . „ . , 01 -„
Shipowners’ policy in relation to the trade of Australia
was, he said, based on the hope that her population would, botn
bv natural increase and by healthy immigration, tend to come
abreast of her great potential resources for the production ot
food, raw material and the employment of ocean transport.
Increasing primary production meant employment and tlie
ability to travel, which must, as people acquired the means, be
reflected in the passenger traffic with Australia, and eventually
in the quantity of goods carried in both directions. On such a
prospect was founded the optimism which had determined tlie
character of the mail steamers commissioned by the r. A U.
Company since the close of the war, or shortly to be coin-
missioned, in reinforcement of the resources for transport be-
tween the Commonwealth of Australia and Great Britain.

IN the blistering glare of noon, the instinct of both humans and
animals is to seek shade. Shade has ever been associated with
protection, Nature’s protection for animals being the sheltering trees, while
the more fortunate human seeks the shade of his verandah or other part of his dwelling.
The dwelling, however, must bear the brunt of heat and glare, with the result that surfaces become
cracked and destroyed, unless adequately protected.
Adequate protection consists of the regular application of good paint. Good paint must contain good
LINSEED OIL, else there can be no protection.
MEGGITFS LINSEED OIL,
manufactured by the world’s best process, is guaranteed
to be intensely durable. It lasts! It forms an elastic,
resistant film which affords the maximum protection
against all climatic conditions.
The Criterion of Good Paint is the Presence of
MEGGITT’S LINSEED OIL, and paint manufacturers
know it.
When you are contemplating painting,
think of Meggitt’s Oil—insist upon it,
and he assured of adequate protection.

The Young Mother.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE caves are dark and the cliffs are grey,
And dim the beach in the new moon’s
light.
Young Mother, what is it that you would
say?—
I feel that you seek for a voice to-night.
Though the leisured waves all silver-fair
Come light of foot to the shining sand,
There is mute appeal in the hushed night air,
In the heaving sea and the breathing land.
I have known you long, and I love you well,
And love, like faith, makes mountains
move;
Now open yoiv soul to my soul and tell
The thing that is close to your heart, my
love.
I bend my ea.' for your whispered word,
But hear no sound save a sea-sent breeze—
A breeze that sighs and a lonely bird
That calls afar in the brooding trees.
Ah, then, that is it! With the breeze you
sighed,
And cried in the night-bird’s lonely call
For those who fought for your sake and died,
And held you fairest and best of all.
Though, strife around them, in peace they
rest,
Your heart cries out for them o’er and
o’er;
You would clasp them close to your good
brown breast
As yours, yours only, for evermore!
The lark shall sing where they take their
sleep,
The world forgotten with all its cares;
Though the old, old Mothers have cause to
weep,
Your cause, young Mother, is more than
theirs.
The old, old Mothers are used to war;
The things that are, in the past have been ;
A young, sweet Mother I think you are
Who weeps in the face of death first seen.
You drank, drank deep of the bitter cup,
And your heart’s in the grave with your
heart’s desire;
But dry your eyes, for a star comes up
With fierce effulgence of piercing fire.
The sea chants now on the dim-lit shores.
Grey grief is drowned, and another voice
Cries loud (and I know that the voice is
yours) :
“Rejoice! In the name of my dead,
rejoice!
“Rejoice for the brave, the deathless ones
Who died, but never shall die to me,
While moons of silver and golden suns
Make bright my bosom of land and sea!”
While thunder rumbles and war-smoke reeks.
And Peace shrinks back, like a muted
ghost,
’Tis thus that the sweet young Mother
speaks
At night in the dark when the soul hears
most.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
The Ghost.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IF you stand on the south side of the cen-
tury-old dam across the Parramatta
River, and look at the King’s School
to-day, you will behold a vastly changed
and altered aspect in the place to that which
you might have contemplated thirty-eight
years ago from the same position. The old
stone building that is the nucleus of the
school, with its Grecian porch and bare,
bleak aspect, remains much as it was when
completed in Governor Bourke’s time, back
in 1836, save that it has recently been turned
inside out, and the stones of the divisional
walls of its interior utilised to add another
storey to it, whilst the ground floor—Upper
and Lower Schools —has been converted into
one great assembly hall. The headmaster’s
house at the east end remains as it was when
re-modelled in 1889, but at the * western
end a huge and heterogeneous red-brick pile
has grown up over the site of the old dining-
hall —a stone-flagged, one-storeyed building
that much resembled a stable —and the whole
look of that part of the school is so changed
as to be quite unfamiliar to any who may
not have seen it between 1890 and the pre-
sent day.
Along the bank of the river huge, shady
weeping-willows now overhang the waters
wdiere formerly the bare curve of “below the
hill” was confronted by the beautiful
•wooded island destroyed in the great flood
of ’B9 when the dam itself was breached
and almost broken up. The “hard stuff”—
a bare area of trampled clay in the middle
of the playground—has been grassed over.
The “parapet,” immediately in front of the
old main building, is narrowed a little, and
is fringed with a neatly-clipped hedge. The
old gymnasium has gone, and the ancient
mulberry-trees at its outer end are long
since dead and departed. The new gym. and
the concrete swimming-baths partly occupy
its position.
Only still remain the dark, foliaged,
stunted trees whose beans were always re-
puted to be the locusts which John the
Baptist consumed with wild honey during his
period of adversity and famine before losing
his head owing to the dancing of the daugh-
ter of ILerodias. Indeed, it was said that
these curious trees, whose fruit when green
might be utilised in inscribing names and
initials upon stone walls—they came out in
dirty brown stains of much disfiguring capa-
city capable of earning “lines” and even
floggings, for the inscribers—it was said
and believed that they were descendants of
the very trees upon which the Baptist had
browsed, transported thither from the Holy
Land by some pious Old Boy pilgrim. (If
he did feed upon them, the holy man must
have had a fine digestion, and no sense of
taste.)
The -wooden armory and the box-room are
gone, and so is the galvanised-iron carpen-
ters’ shop, ■ down by the fence dividing the
lane from the playground, whose only re-
maining link with the present is personified
in the eminent builder and contractor of
Parramatta, many times mayor of the ancient
borough, who was the first instructor there
in the art of spoiling good timber and taking
the edge off expensive tools of carpentry.
Some of us were instinctive carpenters, but
most were merely wood-wasters and plane-
busters.
In the upper storey of the original build-
ing were the four Long Dormitories, lying
in pairs back and front, each pair divided
by the staircase and landing from the others.
Up at the back, in the monstrous -wooden
structure erected in the time of Old Mac
(the Rev. George Fairfowl Macarthur), were
the Tattle Dormitories —three of them —
immediately under the matron’s workroom
and the bathrooms. The curious wooden loft
has recently been removed, and all the upper
portion of the building is now classrooms.
The whole place is changed inside, but so
are we who used to know it all that long
time ago—a good deal more than the King’s
School is. The boys look more like gentle-
men than we did ; but there is little doubt
that they are just the same—no better and
no worse. They, too, might have believed
in the convict’s ghost. Though it is not
this particular spook with which this story
is concerned. He only leads up to, or intro-
duces. the disembodied spirit of Bold Jack
Donahoe.
No. 4 Dormitory in the last quarter of ’BB
—it was the one at the rear of the western
end of the original building—was where the
little boys lived at night-time, and in No.
3, in front of it, dwelt larger ones who toe-
strung us, and tossed us in blankets, and
rolled us out of bed, and generally gave us
a good deal more barbarism than we deserved
—especially on hot summer nights when
sleeping was not too easy. Discipline was
not very good just then—the headmaster was
too mild a person—and “Clobs,” the ser-
geant, had a stiff job keeping over a hun-
dred healthy bush lads in order. There were
supposed to be monitors to assist him, but
they didn’t do much. It was a different
thing next year, when Dr. Harris took
charge. There was a surprising access of
discipline then. He never neglected his pain-
ful duties —which were very often exceed-
ingly so to us—and the school got tightened
COULD EASILY OUTSHINE THAT.
“Sorry, sir—only a few orchestra stalls left. I’m afraid they’re rather near the brass.”
“Aw, no matter! Ve’re not afraid of a leetle bit of brass—are ve, girls?”
up in a fashion that has never been receded
from since.
There were four of us in No. 4 who liung
together, more or less, sharing our crimes
and our sufferings with that fine loyalty to
one another which is so marked an attribute
of boyhood between the ages of twelve and
fifteen. They were the brothers Cobb, Adam
and Rupert, from the Nepean ; Tom Harle,
from somewhere up near the Gulf of Carpen-
taria ; and myself, from the Hunter. Adam
was fourteen, and the other three of us
about fifteen months younger. But “Big
Corncob” never put on any side because of
his advanced age. He was good enough to
regard himself as being on an equality with
the rest of us—and that was pretty generous
on his part, when you come to consider what
a difference fifteen months makes in the ages
of growing boys. He was only about a year
off shaving.
On this hot night in early December we
sat in our sleeping attire —two of us wore
nightshirts—in one of the big windows,
speaking in whispers, and gazing out on to
the moonlit orchard of the priests’ garden
which lies at the back of the old building,
and up along the narrow lane that led past
the bowling-green—made in an earlier day
by “Gurry” Burkitt’s famous staff —to the
masters’ cottage. It led from the back door
between the kitchen and a square stone
building, where the matron lived, and some
of the maids. We talked with awe and
reverence below our breaths about the ghost
that was said to inhabit it.
If Rupert Cobb had not broken his neck
off a buckjumper on his father’s station on
the Lachlan soon after he left school, he
might have developed into some sort of a
poet Mr romantic writer of fiction. He was
a queer, lovable boy, full of dreams and
imaginings, and always looking for stories
in things. All we knew about the ghost
was that a convict engaged in building the
school had been shot by a sentry or a warder
or someone in authority, and that he was
alleged to “walk.” Alphonso, the ancient
“boots.” was supposed by some to have seen
him —by others it was held that Alphonso
was haunted by another brand of spirit.
None of us had ever beheld the apparition,
though we were all fearfully eager to do so.
But Rupert knew the whole story, and we
knew that he knew it because he had made
it up. But none the less we appreciated the
version he told us that night.
In the light of later knowledge, it is to
be doubted wdiether any convicts at all were
employed in building the King’s School.
The -workmen engaged on it were probably
free immigrants of the sort that the Rev.
John Dunmore Lang had been importing
from Scotland. Contractors did not easily
seeure convict labor in 1832. But we were
all quite certain that at least three chain-
gangs had had to do with this particular
job. And it was certain that this ghost,
at any rate, rattled chains when he w r as
engaged in haunting the matron’s quarters.
He was a very orthodox ghost. He even
groaned.
“Yes,” Little Corny whispered, “a terrible
sight he is. His clothes are all over broad
arrows, and his face is deathly white. There’s
a big hole in his forehead where the bullet
hit him, and blood all over his cheek. He
looks at you with blazing eyes, and you never
get ‘over it. That’s why Alphonso’s a bit
loony. And if you look back at him he just
vanishes with a groan—and you’re lucky if
you don’t faint. If I was matron I wouldn’t
live in that place. She must be terrible
brave.”
“Who was the cove, Rupert?” Yallabunda
asked. (That was the name of Tom Harle’s
father's place up in the Gulf country—so,
of course, his nickname.) They called me
Monk. Little Corncob, without any hesita-
tion, supplied full details. He was never
at a loss in matter of this sort. He revelled
in them.
“Oh, his name? John Jones was his
name, and he’d had a sorrowful past. He’d
been wrongfully accused by a villain, and
sentenced to be sent out here by a cruel
Judge, who was the villain’s uncle. He was
a good man, really—like in that book, ‘His
Natural Life.’ Great book that. I’ve read
it twice. And the man who shot him was an
officer in the army—the colonel of the regi-
ment that had to guard the convicts who
built this place. He was the villain’s brother.
He had him buried under that stone house
down there—right under matron’s sitting-
room —in his chains. He’d always kept him
in double irons, and they weighed half a
hundredweight.”
“What was he supposed to have ' done,
Corny?” I asked him.
“Taken the Crown jewels from the Tower
of London,” promptly replied Rupert. * “He
was a good and bold hero —like bold Jack
Donahoe.”
“Give us Jack Donahoe, Rupert,” whis-
pered his brother.
In a sort of whispering chant, Little
Corney gave us that version of the queer old
ballad which begins :
“In Dublin town I was brought up in that city of
great fame—
My decent friends and parents, they will tell to
you the same.
It was for the sake of five hundred pounds I was
sent across the main,
For seven long years in New South Wales to wear
a convict’s chain.”
And at the end of each maudlin verse—
though they were not maudlin then —we mut-
tered the chorus with enthusiasm: —
“Then come, my hearties, we’ll roam the mountains
high !
Together we will plunder, together we will die!
We’ll wander over mountains and we’ll gallop over
plains—
For we scorn to live in slavery, bound down in
iron chains.”
He had a wonderful repertoire of such in-
spiring epies, and when we w r ere out in the
bush round Toongabbie on Saturdays, would
sing them to their dirge-like tunes. He’d
been taught them by an old man who’d been
a convict himself in his very young days—
a sort of pensioner who lived at his father’s
place, Wadbourne, up the Nepean River
from Penrith. There were still old prisoners
alive in the ’eighties—mostly in asylums,
but sometimes, as in the case of Paddy
Rourke, comfortably maintained by the child-
ren of the men to whom they’d been assigned.
“When you fellows come to Wadbourne
for Christmas I’ll tell you what we’ll do.
We’ll go on Christmas Eve to Jack Donahoe’s
cave. It’s on our place. What do you say
to that? An’ maybe we’ll see his ghost.
Old Paddy Rourke’s seen him. He told me
so. He’s jiist as good a ghost,” said Little
Corney, “as this cove down here. And he’s
historicaller. Everyone knows about Bold
Jack Donahoe. It’s only a few of us knows
about this George Smith.”
“I thought you said his name was John
Jones,” corrected Tom Harle.
“No, I didn't —I said George Smith. If
you think”
The gas flared up at the end of the room
near the door, and the tall figure of Clobs
came striding down the aisle between the
feet of the twenty beds. We were caught.
We knew what was coming, as we scurried
for cover.
“Hah!” he said in his famous and fami-
liar accent —he was a Canadian by birth.
“You boys! Out of bed! Half-past eleven!
Get to your beds. If it wasn’t so late I'd
stand you out in the landing. One hour's
pack-drill. F'all in at 12 o’clock to-morrow.”
That meant that we’d get our rifles and
bayonets from the armory immediately on
emerging from morning school, and do sentry-
go up and down the parapet until dinner-
time at one o’clock. No exeats to go down
town.
* * * *
Wadbourne was a beautiful old house,
standing in a park-like 2000 acres of rich
land on the left bank of the Nepean, a few
miles above the bridge where me railway and
the Great Western-road cross over to Emu
Plains. It was one of those four-square,
Georgian buildings, with great stone stables
behind, built in the first quarter of the
nineteenth century, mostly by retired army
officers who had been in the garrison of New
South Wales, and had liked the country so
well that they had sold out and settled here
when their regiments went home or to India.
It had a lovely garden, and a beautiful
orchard, and there was everything there that
boys could want. Horses to ride, and guns
to go shooting with, and boats on the
Nepean, and the wild gullies and gorges of
the Blue Mountains behind, with the Warra-
gamba River running up into them, where
you could go camping. It was too far for
Tom Harle to go home, right up to the
Gulf, and I had been asked to spend the first
10 days of the holidays there, where he was
to spend the whole of them. Mr. Cobb was
very good to us, and Mrs. Cobb was an
angel, and Adam’s and Rupert’s two sisters
—though they were girls, and therefore
naturally of little account —were not such
bad sorts that we couldn’t tolerate them.
They knew their
places, and treated
us with proper re-
spect. That . was
probably because
they went to Miss
Clarke’s boarding-
school in Parra-
matta, and could
appreciate and un-
derstand what tre-
mendous fellows
King’s School boys
were. They knew
the names of all
the chaps in the
Fir s t Fifteen —
Paddy Dane, and
Jack Panton, and
Chu n k Bowman,
and Nulla Roberts
and Nabo Hall,
the captain of the
school and a very
great man indeed,
who was about to
become a doctor.
And they were
pretty girls, who
didn’t put on side,
and were good
riders. So we were
quite civil to them.
They were a little
older than we were
—but of course
they knew they
were girls, and
therefore didn’t
count for much.
They could not, for
instance, be per-
mitted to look for
Donalioe’s ghost on
Christmas Eve.
That was an heroic
undertaking from which they were debarred
by the pitiable misfortune of sex.
But the most interesting feature of the
place to all of us was old Paddy Rourke, a
little bright-eyed old Irishman who’d really
and truly been a convict —and whom I know
now to have been a wonderful and fearsome
old liar. He was 80. and had been sent out
here, so Mr. Cobb said, for having assisted in
burning out an unpopular landlord in Ire-
land—though he claimed himself to have
been a leader of some sort of political move-
ment. Sometimes he would assert that he’d
been out in the ‘Ninety-eight’ —which, of
course, was about 10 years before he was
born. Still, that didn’t matter. We believed
in Paddy, however much Mr. Cobb used to
laugh at the yarns he told us. He cer-
tainly had a wonderful memory for the early
days, and even if what he related of them,
so far as concerned himself, was mainly
boastful exaggeration, he really did know a
lot about early Australia, from Governor
Darling onward. He was, really, with regard
to those far-off times, a sort of Bill Adams
at Waterloo. None of the early Governors had
done much that was of credit to them with-
out consulting Mr. Patrick Rourke. Nothing
much had happened “before the diggin’s bruk
out” that he didn’t have a finger in.
“Mebbe ’tis thrue I was but a poor pris’-
ner, but some o’ thim fellies they knew a
good mahn whin they saw wan. Ould David
Cobb, th’ cove’s gran’fatlier, he says to me,
‘Pat. me mahn, I dunno wot the col’ny’d do
widout ye. Ye’ve bin th’ makin’ o’ me, so
ye have.’ An’ Gov’nor Gipps, he tould ould
Davie, ‘By cripes,’ he says, ‘l’ll not give that
mahn Rourke a pardon. ’Tis back to Ire-
land he’d be afther goin’—an’ we can’t
affoord for to lose him, so we can’t.”
With the greatest enthusiasm he received
our somewhat shy confidences as to how we
intended to seek an interview with the ghost
of the late bushranger Donahoe. We did
not. of course, inform Mr. Cobb, or Mrs.
Cobb, or Grace or Mary, what we were about.
We were to go camping at the mouth of the
Warragamba for a couple of days, returning
home on Christmas moraine. Christmas Eye
we would spend in the outlaw’s lair. Did
Paddy think we had any chance of seeing
the ghost? Was there a ghost? Would he
tell us all about it?


“Och, thin, av coorse there’s a ghost.
Ain’t I seen it mesilf. an’ me knowin’ Jack
Donahoe like we was brothers. Is it loikely
I’d take any ould ghost for Jack’s? Why,
damme, I won’t be sayin’ I wasn’t out wid
Jack mesilf. ’Tis an ould mahn I am, but
there’s thim that don’t know everything.
Faith, I’d like for to go wid ye mesilf. ’Tis
sartain sure he’d come thin for to say howdy-
do to his ould friend. Come now, Rupie lad,”
the old fellow broke into quavering song, and
PRETTY TOUGH.
BIBDY: “ George, dear, would you like mother for lunch to-morrow?”
GEORGE ( absent-mindedly) : “No, thanks, dear; let's wait till my indigestion is better .”
entertained us with three verses, at the end
of each of which he howled the see-saw
chorus.
“As Donahoe. was cruising, one summer’s afternoon,
Little was his notion his death was near so soon,
When a sergeant of the horse-police discharged his
car-a-bine,
And called aloud on Donahoe to fight or to resign.
Now thin —chorus, me young buckos:
‘Resign to you—you cowardly dogs! A thing I
ne’er will do,
For I’ll fight this night with all my might,’ cried
bold Jack Donahoe.
‘l’d rather roam these hills and dales, like wolf or
kangaroo,
Than work one hour for Government! ’ cried bold
Jack Donahoe.”
Half-way through the final verse tears
began to run down the old man’s furrowed
cheeks, as he sat on a stool by the stable
door —his favorite position. At the end he
wept freely. We were greatly affected.
“Och! ’Tis th’ foine lad he was. An’ if
ye see him, Rupie, boy, ye’ll give him Faddy
Rourke’s koind love.”
Just as the ranges behind us were turning
black, and night was creeping down over
Emu Plains, we reached the hole in the
sandstone which local legend had long glori-
fied as a lurking place of the villainous and
murderous young Irishman who had for four
years harried the countryside between
Windsor and Camden, before he was shot
dead in an encounter with some soldiers,
near the latter place, in 1830. I did not
know Mr. Donahoe as well then as I do
now, and instead of regarding him as a cruel
and sordid beast of prey shared the views of
my companions as to his having been a sort
of Robin Hood —a romantic figure of some-
what chivalrous lawlessness.
We were all a little scared, and, as dark-
ness settled down, huddled close together and
talked in whispers. Even young Rupert
seemed to be frightened, though he was in a
curiously excited and nervously exalted
mood. One of enthusiastic terror, so to
speak.
“It’ll be midnight when he comes,” he
whispered. “You got your watch, Adam?
How long’ve got to wait for him? Old Faddy
says lie’s sure to come, and I’m to give him
Paddy’s love. Oh, I do wish the time’d go
quicker!”
“It’s eight o’clock,” said his brother, strik-
ing a match and looking at his proudest
possession, the ownership of which gave
him about as much standing amongst us as
his advanced age. “Four hours to wait.”
Slowly the evening dragged on. “More-
porks” croaked in the thick timber below
us, and now and then a curlew would wail
down on the river fiats. All about were
the hundred and one noises of the bush at
night—little noises that seem to make its
silence more profound—and the bright stars
looked down through the boughs overhead,
whilst the faintest of gentle breezes rustled
the gum-leaves. We all smoked. It seemed
a courageous, manly thing to do. And we
were all very scared.
We made Rupert recite to us, and he went
completely through his great stock of dog-
gerel. For that is all those old bush songs
are. But he wouldn’t give us “Bold Jack
Donahoe” to-night.
“It might seem like cheek,” he said —“with
him hanging about ready to show himself
at twelve o’clock. I wouldn’t like to.”
Tom Harle fell asleep about eleven, and
snored loudly. Rupert was very indignant,
and punched him in the ribs to make him
wake up.
“Enough to keep him away, you fathead!
he expostulated. Yallabunda apologised, and
we huddled closer together, for it_ was grow-
ing cold. After a very long time, Adam
looked at his watch again.
“Ten —to —twelve !” he whispered.
Those minutes were very long and fearful
ones, and my heart was in my boots. We
strained our eyes, peering into the darkness
down the slope. Somehow, we seemed to
picture the bushranger stalking towards us
up the hill —I don’t know why we didn t
expect him to materialise right on the spot.
Suddenly young Rupert gripped my arm.
Dimly I could see that he was pointing
down the hill. “Oh look!” he whispered
hoarsely. “Down there!”
I strained my eyes, but could not see
anything. And so did the others. All of
us but Little Corny. I could hear the teeth
chattering. And then he began to pray.
He gasped out the Lord’s Prayer, in a
funny, weak moaning little voice. He’d
got as far as “Forgive us our trespasses,”
when he suddenly let out a yelp of fear and
stood up, shrieking.
“Oh, his eyes! Oh, the blood on his
shirt! Oh, his bad face! Oh, lie’s a devil —
a devil — -a devil!”
With a final gurgling scream, he tumbled
down in a sort of fit, and squirmed about
in the dust. We saw nothing. “ Dammit!
let’s get out of this,” croaked Adam.
' We picked Rupert up and blundered down
the hill through the trees and scrub to a
little creek at its foot. We bathed his head
with water, but it was long before he came
to. And the queer thing is he remembered
nothing at all about it afterwards. But
he’d never mention Bold Jack Donahoe
again.
“Be dam’!” said old Paddy when we told
him what had happened. “Be dam’! ’Tis
the little fellie’s wan that sees. Me own
soort. As for ye, ye’d not see tli’ angel
Gabreel, an him blowin’ his trumpit at
the warld’s ind, in a blaze o’ glory. Rupie’s
th’ wan ! But don’t none o’ ye iver make
fun of him.”
We never did. This is a true story. At
least

Poetic Justice
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE one man who should have known
something about handcuffs as part
of the police equipment was the
very one who remained silent during our
discussion of them in the railway carriage.
But when we got out and he and I were
strolling along the road toward our respec-
tive homes, a sudden waft of the miraculous
smell of burning eucalyptus-leaves dispersed
his reserve.
“Strange,” he declared suddenly, “when
you have anything on your mind you meet
it in some way at every damn turn. You
blighters talked handcuffs all the way from
the Point to Turramurra, and no sooner do
I get away from that than some idiot goes
burning gum-leaves. I left the Fierce to get
away from the sight of handcuffs, and I left
the bush to get away from that smell.”
Pie was a bush type rather than a city
one, and I had known that he had once been
a mounted trooper. I also knew that, fine
fellow though he was, bushman though he
had been, I had never really got next to him.
He was one of those with whom you feel
that in the mansion of the mind there is a
locked room.
“I’ve not told a soul about it so far,” he
continued. “Always funked it. But God
knows I’ve wanted to get it off my chest.
There are some things not good to keep to
oneself. Any secret is bad. It is repressive
and constricting. That is the charm of child-
hood .... a kiddie has no reservations.... it
has never used handcuffs. Once you have a
secret to nurse you become guarded, and
unspontaneous. When it is a horrible one,
like mine, it permeates and discolors the
whole personality.”
I began to realise that there was a reason
why I had never quite got next to Jeff,
though I lived next door to him. He went
on:
“No matter what line of thought or deed
or speech you follow, sooner or later it will
impinge upon the secret, and you are ever-
lastingly coming up against a blank wall
where you have to say to yourself: ‘Thus
far and no farther.’ ”
Jeff Hastings did not usually philosophise
like this.
“It was in Southern Queensland, out
west,” he explained. “I was a bank clerk,
but after the land boom the bank broke, and
I had to find something else to do. I joined
the mounted police. Not a bad job—plenty
of outdoor life and excitement. And there
was no worry. At least not till I had to
go out after Morvey, the murderer. It was
known that he was making south; and when
the description of him came through to
Sergeant Marrivay—Marrivay the martinet
we used to call him —we picked the fellow at
once. Remembered that, a couple of days be-
fore, he had arrived at Fagan’s pub, given his
name as Charlie West and stayed there the
night. There was no shadow of doubt; the
description tallied perfectly. ‘You’d remem-
ber him again, wouldn’t you?’ said the ser-
geant, and I said, ‘You bet.’ ”
Jeff Hastings paused a moment in his
narrative, as though pondering some point,
and continued:
“I set out with a
couple of horses to track
the fellow, and arrested
him just after dawn at
a lagoon a hundred-odd
miles away toward the
border. He was a decent-
looking chap for such a
bloodthirsty villain. That
made it worse made
him seem more treacher-
ous. I gave him the
slower neddy, and told
him to ride a little ahead.
Of course he persisted
that he was Charlie
West; said he’d never
heard of Morvey, and all
that. But otherwise he
was quite tractable. Made
no fuss. In fact, lie set
himself out to be agree-
able. I guessed his lurk
—throw me off my guard
and do for me. Not a
pleasant prospect!”
Hastings paused to re-
light liis cigar and then
digressed a moment:
“The Morvey affair was a savage bit of
business. It had started in a quarrel about
a boundary fence, grew bitter, and in the
end Morvey stunned the other chap—l for-
get his name —tied him hand and foot,
carried him into his hut and set fire to it.
Enough evidence left to show that the poor
devil had really been roasted alive. Horrible!”
Somehow I was reminded of the Ancient
Mariner; it was so obvious that Hastings
had to tell about the affair, and yet would
willingly have forgotten it if he could. lie
resumed at the point of digression:
“1 started back straight away with him ;
and we had breakfast at a survey party s
camp that we struck. By evening we reached
the river—waterliole here and there, you
know —and found a good spot to camp.
There was a wide bend where the stream,
when it flowed, had eaten deep, leaving high
banks and a patcli of river flat, covered by
a large clump of thick scrub and a few taller
trees. There was good water, and we were
sheltered from the wind.’’
The narration was becoming disjointed,
with silences intervening, and in places keen
attentiveness was needed to follow it.
Hastings had lighted a fire and they were
preparing camp, the trooper keeping such
an alert eye on the movements of his prisoner
that he failed to notice that the horses had
strayed to where the river bank was lower
and gave easy egress
from the basin. He
had not hobbled them
—they were reliable
animals and unlikely
to stray from, the
water and its adjacent
patch of pasturage.
But a disturbance
called his attention to
them. Something had
frightened the ani-
mals —they were gal-
loping madly away in
the direction of the
dry scrub-country.
There was no time
for formalities. Jeff
was a young trooper.
He did not wish to
lose his prisoner, and
it might be death to
lose the horses.
SUPPLYING A SHORTAGE.
“Hey, Elinor, old bean, I shall marry beauty .”
“And, Bertie, old top, I shall marry brains.”
“Ah, that's right; and then we’ll both be set.”
“Come along!” he commanded, and hustled
his man through the riverside bush to the
nearest of the trees growing among it. It
was not a large tree —about a foot through,
with the lowest branch, a wide-spreading
one, level with the top of the surrounding
bush, and the short stump of a broken branch
a trifle lower down. Ordering the prisoner to
place his arms round the tree Jeff clipped
the handcuffs on his wrists, so that he
resembled a drunk embracing a telephone-
post. It was not very comfortable, but it
was only temporary and it was effective.
It took the trooper an hour to catch the
horses and start back to the camp, the wind
meanwhile having become a gale.
When he came near the river bend he
broke into a sudden gallop. The distance
was short. It took him only a few seconds
to cover it, but he was too late. Pulling
up at the brink of the high bank he unwill-
iugly had a dress-circle view of what was
still happening.
The wind had fanned the camp-fire so
that it had spread to the bush, and the patch
of river-flat luxuriance was a raging in-
ferno ! The prisoner, held fast by the tree,
had climbed it in desperation—had climbed
as far as the lowest entire branch, where
the handcuffs prevented him from ascending
further, though he had contrived to work
them up over the obstacle formed by the
jutting end of the broken branch. Then,
either through terror or weakness, since he
could not further ascend, he had tried to
descend and had got the handcuffs caught
by the stumpy end of that broken branch.
Thus he was suspended there by the wrists,
unable to get either up or down.
Under the fury of the wind the fire was a
roaring malevolence which filled the hollow;
and through the surging waves of smoke
Trooper Hastings could see his prisoner
hanging to the tree, embracing it like an
old-time convict tied up for a bush flogging,
while the gale, like an avenging flagcllator,
wielded the thongs of flame, a fiery cat-o’-
nine-tails, about that tormented body writh-
ing spasmodically.
As Hastings stared helplessly at that
awful spectacle the smoke blew clear aside,
a great thong of flame swung high and coiled
round the body, from which there leapt one
long intolerable scream.
“My God! It was horrible!” gasped Hast-
ings. “I’ll never forget that sound. It
haunts me!”
I tried to console his conscience somewhat,
and merely made some trite remarks. “After
all, it was not your fault, Jeff! It was more
like the intrusion of a Nemesis. His death
duplicated his crime. Talk about poetic jus-
tice !”
“Poetic justice!” repeated Hastings.
“That’s what I said to myself, to quieten my
conscience. But it was no use. It was too
much my fault. I should have, hobbled the
horses. I should have thought of the fire.
I said ‘poetic justice’ and still felt troubled.
And because of that I did a silly thing,
After the fire had burned itself out I felled
the tree, undid the handcuffs, and buried the
body. When I got back I told Marrivay that
I had caught the fellow but that he had got
away from me. I had to admit having found
him because the survey party had seen us.
“Marrivay the martinet stormed high
heaven in his anger, you bet. I don’t know
what he didn’t call me. Talk about abuse!
Morvey the murderer! Promotion for us
both ! All mulled by my stupidity! And he
wound up by wanting to know in the name
of suffering idiocy why I hadn’t got wits
enough to handcuff the fellow to a tree?”
I admitted that this was just about the
stone-finish in unconscious irony.
“But that wasn’t the finish!” Hastings
corrected. “Poetic justice aside, that dying
scream haunted me —you can’t imagine a
sound like it. Anyway, a few days later I
had to go off for a couple of weeks on a
rather exciting chase of some cattle-duffers,
and when I got back Marrivay the martinet
was all cordiality. Almost fell on my neck,
so to speak. Told me what he thought was
good news, blast him! He shattered the
onlv consolation my conscience had.”
“How so?” I asked, rather needlessly.
“He told me to thank my lucky stars,”
replied Hastings. “Said that Morvey had
been caught in Sydney and had confessed.
The chap I had arrested was as innocent as
a poddy calf. And he ended up by telling
me, all the same, to be on the safe side
and always use handcuffs. D’you wonder I
left the Force?”
I did not, and he drifted into silence from
a final soliloquising sort of comment:
“As for poetic justice!”

“the PRODIGAL’S RETURN.”


Space and a Poet.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BILLY Pagan’s young wife had called
him back to have his neckscarf
untied and retied, and to pick from
his coat fluff invisible but to the eyes
of love, and to re-kiss him before permitting
him to dare the dangers of traffic in
almost deserted streets. The young love
of a woman believes that every street and
all the wheeled and hoofed traffic therein is
in a conspiracy to murder the beloved. Vain
for him to prove that before the girl ever
saw him he had come safely through such
perils as teething, measles, unripe fruit, fence-
climbing, riding on fire-engines and learning
to swim. Billy Pagan convinced Mrs. Billy
as little by his statement of victories over
childhood’s dangers as he did in explaining
his habit of splashing water on the bathroom-
floor—he told her that when a solid body
meets a mobile element displacement is inevit-
able. Mrs. Billy regarded this as clever,
but intended to deceive.
At last the scarf was re-fixed for the last
time that morning, the ultimate invisible
fluff was removed from Billy Pagan’s coat,
and for the last time he was re-kissed. He
ran across the street, turned the corner
nearest the ugly tower of a concreted town
hall —a town hall which was the youngest
of a numerous, heavy and ugly family born
in the mind of a suburban architect
and now scattered over twenty sub-
urbs, each as the head of the family
of an unnecessary municipality.
Billy Pagan’s job was that of a
journalist of the suburbs. For the
Daily News he was the scribe and
recorder of four such suburbs—of
four concrete town halls and four
abstract mayors and councils, of six
police-stations and their companies.
He supplied the Daily News with
records which the Daily News pub-
lished under such deceptive headings
as “Police Intelligence” and “Muni-
cipal Intelligence.” On rare occa-
sions of daring, the sub-editor gave
Billy’s reports such general headings
as “Crime in the Suburbs” or “Hus-
bands and Wives,” to generalise
many cases of quarrels of the mar-
ried who had so performed their
vows to cleave unto one another
until death did them part that large
policemen had been required to sepa-
rate them.
Billy’s was a life full of interest,
once he overcame his hatred of the
sordid and the mean he had to record
in crime; his municipal work was
continuously a humorous experience,
by reason of the comic dignity of
mayors and the wild pretensions of
councillors. His only bitterness was
the being paid by results —not the
results of the work he did, but of
such ‘of it as sub-editors chose to
use. To write fifteen columns a
week and be paid for the two that
found publication was a continuous
injustice. Even poets and lovers
must eat; and now that the partner-
ship stated its intention of becoming
a trinity the anxiety of the young
journalist expressed itself in the fear
that, this week or next, publication
might fall below the two columns
that had seemed the irreducible mini-
mum. So God send a good murder
in one of Billy’s four suburbs!
He reached the concrete mauso-
leum that was the town hall, turned
into the lane on its south side and
entered the police-station in the base-
ment. From the station a spiral
stair led into the floor of the court,
so that when a prisoner was
adjudged spotless he descended to
the street by a straight stairway,
and when guilty he returned spirally
to the cells.
In the outer office Billy Pagan
found two friends who were sharers
of the anxiety of “living on space”
—Albert Merry, of the Telegraph,
kindest of men, living for the mate
of the moment, rich because he had
few needs and not a vice, and faith-
ful as Tom Pinch; and Frith, whose
enthusiasm in the presence of a
crime worth a certain half-column
was ever new, so that he might be
said to be reborn every day. He
was incapable of growing up, and
had been known after putting his
copy into the office to anticipate pub-
lication by spending the probable pro-
ceeds in beer for his friends—and
himself.
He found there also Sergeant Rat-
tray, the most polite man who ever
wore a uniform; Macdew, whose suc-
cessful fight against the regulation
that said he must submit the names
of his intended wife to the Commis-
sioner for inquiry broke down a
convention necessary only for Jona-
than Wild; Constable Beeman, an
enormous soft, fat man wearing
much of his fat above his ears; and Sergeant
Stokely, a tall man in hard condition —
kindly, black-bearded, thin and tireless as
Don Quixote; a man whose seriousness
deepening to gloom contradicted his perfect
health, until one knew that his gloom was
only that of a poet.
From the nearest cell proceeded a high
energetic soprano, educated, but now sound-
ing as if frayed by gin—the voice of a lady
well known to the police as one who never
lost her cheerfulness. She sang above the
conversation of journalists and police:—
“Brightly dawns upon me, dawns upon me,
With its gla-a-dsome ray,
When returning—when returning—to the la-di-iddy-
da.”
“Annie again ?” said Billy Pagan; and
Merry answered him: “Yes, that’s all.”
“Then we starve.”
“Well,” said Rattray, running his practised
eyes down the charge-sheet, “there’s four
other drunks, one obscene language and one
found by night.”
“Not enough for canary-seed, and we
wanted corn.”
“I have two cases,” said Constable Bee-
man, the rolls of fat on his forehead shaking
as if attempted thought convulsed him.
“Straying goats, Fatty?” said Frith.
“Not all shtrayin’ goats. T’ree of thirn
is harses.”
“There’s nothin ’doin’,” said the gloomy
Stokely. “Never a thing happens. I don’t
know what the place is cornin’ to. In the
ould days there was burgelries, war wit’
the pushes, two-up, an’ a murder at Christ-
mus toime. Now ’tis Singin’ Annie drunk
ag’in, an’ petty larcency, an’ shtrayin’ goats
an’ harses”....
So Billy Pagan and Merry and Frith went
to the desperate work of writing of that old
inoffensive offender, Singing Annie, as if she
were a new atrocity, in the manner of men
paid on space.
Then Billy Pagan and Merry and Frith,
hunting, like beagles become journalists, for
something sufficiently horrible to pass the
sub-editor and produce money, made the
round of their police-stations and their
magistrates’ courts, and of the town clerks
who furnished “Municipal Intelligence.”
Their beating of coverts produced only small
game—a little housebreaking, two Peter
Ticklers (which is to say robbers of tills)
and one traffic accident whose value was
reduced because, although serious, it had
unfortunately not been fatal.
“No news is a disease,” said Frith.
“There’s no disease then,” replied. Billy
Pagan. “There is plenty of news, but it
is the wrong sort for us. If virtue were
marketable I could find six columns of it
at this moment. But if I took in a column
headed ‘Shocking Case of Honesty’ or ‘An
Orgie of Decency’ my sub. would have me
examined by two doctors.”
Billy Pagan left his home for the last
rounds of the summer night. At his most
important police-station, Billson, the watch-
housekeeper, who had relieved Rattray at
dusk, told him that Stokely had a prisoner
—a drunken ruffian with half a dozen charges
writ with Billson’s fair right hand in the
desk-register. Stokely was at home changing
his damaged uniform and the prisoner was
in No. 3 cell. Billy looked through the
trapdoor and saw in the sunlight a big
young Hercules whose head was bandaged.
He sat on the cell floor, holding his bandaged
head in his hands; groaning a little, but
otherwise showing no interest in life. On
the face of it his offence was being a
brawler while in liquor. Billy Pagan com-
pleted his rounds per telephone, and walked
home disgusted at the poor hunting of the day.
But next morning he was ready to be-
lieve that yesterday’s hunting had been good,
though well disguised; and he was as sur-
prised as a hunter who has fired in the dark
at a jackal to find at dawn that he has
shot a lion. For at the police-court was
Sergeant Stokely, his poetry forgotten, and
all Officer of the Peace, importantly giving
evidence against one James McEwan, the
Hercules of the bandaged head.
“From inf’mayshun received, your Wor-
sh’ps,” said Stokely, “I visited the home of
pris’ner’s father in Char-les-str-r-r-eet,
Abbotsforrd. Pris’ner was overcome be drink,
was vi’lent, resist’darest, ashaulted me ’n
execution jooty. kicked me shins, shtruck me
on right eyeball, an’ used obscane langwidge.
Claim dam’ges uniform twenty-three shil-
lin’s.”
“Any questions?”
Hercules had not any questions—said he
took a few beers, didn’t remember anything
till he found himself in the cell with his
head broke somethin’ crool.
The amateur judiciary frowned, consulted
the clerk of petty sessions and delivered judg-
ment, Hercules groaning at each addition to
the High Cost of Nemesis: “Ten shillings
for drunkenness, forty shillings for offensive
behavior, forty shillings for obscene langu-
age, forty shillings and twenty-three shillings
expenses for damaging police uniform, three
pounds for resisting arrest and five pounds
for assaulting the police—a cash total of
£l5 13s. or 105 days’ gaol.”
Hercules purchased his liberty with coin
of the Commonwealth, and departed groaning.
Outside the court Stokely approached Billy
Pagan with all the respect to the press of
the publicity-chaser who needs its use.
“There’s something good I give you, Mr.
Pagan.”
“Worth twenty lines. Stoke.”
“An’ tell me why ’tis worth no more?”
“Evidence formal—a mere brawl —no
picturesque trimmings.”
“There was; but service orders wouldn’t
let me tell them.”
“Come with me, then, and tell me.’
“’Twas this way. I cud tell a gintleman
of the press, an’ not a J.P. without know-
ledge or education. You wud know I have
me share of poetry. Tell that to a J.P., an’
the poor, simple-moinded thing wud stare
at you dumbfoundthered or maybe laugh at
you on the sly. But a gintleman of the press
would undershtand—is that so?”
Billy Pagan assured him that it was so.
“I knew ut. Plenty o’ min wit’ no under-
shtandin’ wud laugh, but not a gintleman.
People in the sordhid ways of life think that
a polisman’s life is sordhid. But you wud
know that a polisman wud not be thinkin’
all his toime of burgelries an’ dhrunk min,
an’ punchin’ Peter Ticklers an’ movin’ on.
Outside of his jooty a polisman thinks of
grreat thoughts an’ poethry an’ lith’ry splen-
dhor then. I mind me one night goin’ up
Victoria-parade, checkin’ the min on the
beat. ’Twas near one in the mornin’; shtar-
light was lyin’ in pools of shadow on the
ashphalt shinin’ like the sea; the threes in
the plantations just movin’ in the air that
was breathin’ softly like a pretty woman
asleep, an’ shinin’ over Foshter’s Brewery
was the moon in her full pride.”
“Did you get that out of a book, Ser-
geant ? ,J
“God forgive me if I did! Out o’ me soul
it kem that night—me soul liftin’ in glad-
ness of bein’ alive an’ alone in the quiet
shtreet. Tliinkin’ of moonlight an’ white
statues glimmerin’ among sliypress-threes, an’
beautiful women, an’ moonlight an’ grreat
an’ shplendid deeds of piracy; an’ ’twas that
moment passin’ the corner of Rokeby-shtreet
that some dhirrty dog of an inimy shtruck
me with a big shtick over the mouth in the
midsht of me shtargazin’, an’ laid me out on
the ashplialt for five-tin minyutes ; an’ never
a sight I got of ’im. Whin I got up poetry
was out of me, an’ I raged round to kill the
man that thried to murdther me; an’ all I
found was a tort’shell cat goiu’ home shame-
faced from his coortin’.”
“But the Abbotsford case last night, Ser-’
geant?”
“I’m there to ut. ’Tis in the hot dusk
last night worrd kem t’ me of a hullabaloo in
Char-les-shtreet, Abbotsforrd. I procaded t’
the address indicated, an’ there I found an’
ould woman upbraidin’ an’ ould man with
ghreat ferosliity. The ould man had a bung
eye, which he tould me was the craft and
handiwork of his son”
“Hercules who was fined £l5 to-day?”
“The same; devil doubt him ! The ould
woman said the ould man was the cause,
thryin’ to take sixty-nine pounds fifteen an’
six from liis son while the son was
quietly shleepin’ off dhrink taken in
the afternoon. ‘An’ why did yon
thry to rob him?’ I says. ‘Not
robbin’,’ says the ould man; ‘but
thryin’ to care for his money he
earned shiftin’ muck for the Gov’-
mint on the Waranga Basin Water-
works,’ he says. ‘An’ then,’ he says,
‘me own son hit me, an’ says he’ll
shlay me wit’ a pickhandle, an’ then
out lie goes for more dhrink.’ ‘ ’Tis
your fault,’ says the ould woman,
‘thryin’ to rob ’iin.’ ‘Shuhhush,
woman,’ I says, ‘ ’tis not the p’int.
Is he coinin’ back ag’in?’ ‘That is
our fear,’ the ould man says; ‘ ’twas
why they sint f’r me. 1 assured
them of the effishincy of the force,
when sudden the young man arrived.
I was about to tell him he shouldn’t
shlay his father wit’ pickhandles
when, aperiently takin’ umbrage at
my prisince, he rushed at me an’
handed me one terrible blow on
the shnout that was like the kick of
a liorrse. Wit’ that I lay into um.
He was a great, woild fighter of a
man, an’ I uslied me fishts on him
—without effect aperiently, for he
kicked mo terrible on the shins that
would have made a man with wooden
legs screech murdther. In me great
ag'ny I threw pity to the winds of
Heaven; an’ I drew me baton an’
fanned him with science an’ preci-
sion. A few clips on the slikull an’
he went down, an’ there was I with
me jumper torn off an’ me nose
an’ eyeballs in ag’ny, an’ me shins
shmartin’ like salt on a flayed man;
an’ the ould man an’ the ould
woman takin’ sides ag’in’ me, an’
tellin’ me I murdered the best son
in the worrld brought sixty-nine
pound fifteen an’ six he earned
shiftin’ muck for the Gov’mint on
the Waranga Basin Waterworks. So
maybe I’m tliinkin’ I hit him a clip
too hard whin I fanned him wit’ me
baton; an’ so I upended him ag’in
the watherpipe in the garden with
the hollyhocks there shtandin’ in the
hot dusk like tall, thin girls with
rosettes down their shkirrts; an’ the
sunflowers’ big, round, young, yellow
faces lookin’ sorrowful at the day
gone, like childer at the end of the
picnic. An’ the flowers made me
sorrowful for the poor man. An’
I says, ‘Here, me poor man! Here’s
beautiful wather,’ I says, ‘to bathe
y’r poor head,’ I says. An’ he says,
‘Sorrer to the big stiff that done me
dirt.’ An’ I says, ‘Who might it
be?’ An’ he says, ‘You, you corpus
of a black Dago!” he says—‘blast
you,’ he says, ‘you bruk me
head.’
“ ‘Quiet, quiet now,’ I says, slap-
pin’ the wather in his face with a
liankerchy.
“ ‘Quiet,’ says he, ‘you accident to
a mongrel,’ he says, risin’ an’ hittin’
me on the nose ag’in.”
“So then there was more fanning
with the baton?”
“Not in self-defince, but in defince
of the law’s majesty ag’in a brawl-
in’ man wit’ sixty-nine pound fifteen
an’ sixpence for shiftin’ muck on the
Waranga Basin Waterworks, that
would shlay his father wit’ a pick-
handle an’ beat a sargint’s nose into
a pincushion, ag’in the peace of
our Sovereign Lord the Primeer,
and to the unsafe-ety of his liege
subjects an’ the displeasure of
Almighty God. But bein’ soft-hearted to the
poor wandherin’ lad, the clip I hit him was
but to quiet him; but it shuk up his poor
addled brains, an’ with that he sat him down
in the garden among the hollyhocks, an’ burst
out into loud sobbin’.
“ ‘There, me poor man,’ I says, shwabbin’
his althered faytures wit’ me liankerchy.
‘Sore I am with the boatin’ of you,’ says
I, ‘an’ sore are my shins with kicks from
your navigator’s boots would suit a nele-
phint enthered for the Olympic games. But
come you now, my friend,’ I says, ‘from
the sunflowers and the hollyhocks gone
modesthly to sleep, not wantin’ to see your
outrageousness an’ your defeat,’ I says.
‘Come now to a cool cell an’ a quiet dungeon
under the Town Hall,’ says I. ‘May the
crows pick the eyes out uv you,’ says he,
‘after I’ve bruk both your legs an’ left you
on a bullant bed,’ says he. ’Twas no in-
vitin’ openin’ to a gintlemanly conversation,
but I put the fragments of his clothin’ decent,
an’ looped the ribbons of me destructed
jumper round me neck, an’ left the ould man
an’ the ould woman howlin’ for me blood;
an’ I histed the strong man wit’ the cracked
head to his feet an’ led him into Char-les-
shtreet, an’ tould the murmurin’ crowd to go
NOCTURNE.

home; an’ led me man nor’-east along the
basalt street to his dungeon under the Town
Hall.
“Then, Mr. Pagan, ’twas a night of beauty
for a man to come home after stress an’
vict’ry. Almost in our eye was the risin’
moon, red like a Mildura orange, copper-
red it was, an’ so full of light ye cud see
the little holes where the coppersmiths had
beat the coat on to the skin of her.”
“Repoussg work on the moon—that’s new.”
“What you say, Mr. Pagan, you say. Man,
there’s nothin’ can get me solimn an’ tinder
an’ soft-hearted like the moon. An’ this
moon last night was big wit’ heat—big an’
red an’ indivijool to every man, so that every
man that cud think would think the moon
was shinin’ for him an’ no other body. The
heat-haze quivered around the protubrous
moon in the vi’let gloamin’ ”
“You were so poetic, I suppose, the pri-
soner escaped?”
“No, he did not—not thin or any other
time. Poetry was in me, but not to the
harm of me jooty. I led along the man
who’d been destructed by earnin’ sixty-nine
pounds fifteen shillings an’ sixpence shiftin’
muck for the Gov’mint on the Waranga
Basin Waterworks; an’ me mind was in me
jooty, but me soul was wit’ the moon. Did
you ever see curtains of mist goin’ up in a
theatre, veil on veil?”
“Yes—theatre people call them gauzes.”
“That’s it, gauzes they were, thin an’
grey-blue, an’ the moon would push nigh
through them, but never break them, only
bulge the veil. An’ the ashphalt an’ the mean
gutters was beautiful, an’ out of the little
gardens of the mean streets came perfume
an’ schent of stock an’ rose, an’ magnolia,
an’ little shuburban min, tired from work
but not too tired to put on the garden hose,
an’ never mind the Water Board that tells
people to shtarve the flowers. ’Twas too
good to keep to a man’s self; the perfume
an’ the schent cornin’ out of the earth to
waft incense to the moon. An’ I says to
the pris’ner, ‘Lift up y’r eyes, me man, an’
look on beauty.’
“ ‘T’ Hell wit’ you,’ says he: ‘t’ Hell
wit’ you an’ y’r moon! Wit’ y’r flamin’
club y’ bruk me head in two.”
“ ‘Forget that,’ says I; ‘lnk at the moon.’
“ ‘Luk at the moon,’ says he, ‘wit’ me eye
gouged out wit’ your big fat Irish thumb
an’ me brains wet on me neck,’ says he.
“ ‘Me thumb’s not so fat since you chewed
it till I cracked you,’ says I, ‘an’ ’tis not
brains on your neck, but wather I put there,
soppin’ you back to rayson,’ says I. ‘Listen
to me,’ says I, ‘me bould bucko from
Waranga, an’ do’s I tell you, or the Water-
works will see you no more. Look at the
moon or I’ll fan you with my slitick ag’in.’
“ ‘Don’t do that,’ he says, ‘let me live
overnight. I’ll look at your flamin’ moon.
Where is it?’
“ ‘Right ahead of you. Do you see it?’
“‘I do,’ says he. ‘God help me, I’ll see
six moons if you don’t fan me any more.’
“ ‘Rayson,’ says I, ‘returns to her throne.
Now march you an’ listen. Look at the
moon walkin’ in the light of her own beauty.
An’ ’twas the same God that made the moon
that give you sixty-nine pound fifteen an’ six
shiftin’ muck at Waranga.’
“ ‘You’re a liar,’ he says, ‘I earned it, an’
O’Toole, the ganger, paid me.’
“ ‘Will I fan you?’
“ ‘No, no! For the love of God, don’t fan
me. I tell you I see the flamin’ moon, don’t
I?’ he says.
“ ‘Your eyesight saved your head, me lad,’
says I. ‘Listen —there’s the moon, an’ God
made it, an’ God gave you sixty-nine pound.’
“ ‘Fifteen an’ six,’ he says.
“ ‘You’re right,’ I says; ‘but don’t talk.
Listen! God gave you that money, an’ God
made a train to bring your awkward carcase
to Melbourne; an’ the Devil gave you beer.
God gave you beauty to walk in ; instead of
which,’ says I, ‘you try to shlay your father
wit’ a pickhandle, wit’ poetry walkin’ the
world in the cool of the evenin’, an’ the
moon on high floatin’ in her bath of glamor
to the music of the garden shents. God for-
give you all you’re losin’.... an’ here’s the
lockup.’ ”
“Ah, Sergeant, why didn’t you let him go?”
_ “Never neglect jooty. Sorry I was for
him, but jooty’s a jool. Six charges I had
ag’in him, an’ then we found his purse was
lost. I remember the struggle in the garden.
’Twasn’t any Pelman system I wanted, wit’
me barked shins gnawin’ at me. An’ there
I found it under a big sunflower that was
bent over wit’ the weight of the night an’ was
lookin’ down at filthy lucre wit’ contempt.
Sixty-nine pound twelve shillin’s there was
in it after his last by-drinkin’s of three an’
sixpence. Back I went to the poor man in
the cell. Groanin’ he was, an’ couldn’t
sleep, so I read him a few of me poems there
till two in the mornin’; an’ sleep he did.”
“Did he object to your poems?”
“Would he? An’ me losin’ me rest in the
good cause of charity?”
“I see; but, after that, how could you
have the heart to prosecute him all the way?”
“Jooty—an’ jooty’s not poetry. Reverse
of it, I say. But after he paid his fines an’
left the dock, he says to me, ‘Hard, crool an’
hard you were, after I told you I see your
moon.’ ”

Billy Pagan laughed all the way home
and wrote his scoop joyously. Then he filed
it with the exultation of somebody very
young who has written something very good.
The reading of it brought joy to a sub-
editor and a leader of the staff.
“Fine!” said the sub. “But, of course,
we can’t print it.”
“Pity!”
“Yes, but you know what the Old Man
did to Jowett? ‘Wha’s this, Jowett?’ he
says. ‘That, Mr. McPherson,’ says Jowett—
‘that’s a joke.’ Slash came the blue pencil.
‘A jok’,’ says old Mac —‘ye’ll no’ jok’ in this
paper; an’ I’m thinkin’ ye’ll jok’ yersel’ oot
of it.’ No, daren’t do it.”
“A pity!”
And the journalism that hurts not any adver-
tiser’s politics, sectarianism, stupidity or
prejudice recorded this of the Hercules from
Waranga to whom God gave the moon and
sixty-nine pounds fifteen an’ six:—
At the Colling-wood Court yesterday a man named
Jas. McEwan was charged with drunkenness, in-
sulting behavior, obscene language, damaging police
uniform, resisting arrest and assaulting the police
and was fined a total of £l5 13s. ; in default fifteen
weeks’ gaol.

The Vengeance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN, through the inch-wide cracks
between the slabs of the dairy, old
Klaus saw Alpin hook up his bay at
the sliprails and stride across the cropped
paspalum toward the bails, he knew some-
thing very serious was amiss. He could see,
even though a clear two-hundred yards
separated them, that the young returned
soldier’s face was set in grim lines, and also
that it was haggard.
Putting two and two together in his own
methodical way, he guessed the reason of the
visit. It was nearly twelve months since
Alpin and his fluffy-haired city wife went
out to their war-selection, two miles around
on the other side of Grey Knob. That
either of them —for Alpin was an obvious
war wreck when they came—had managed
to stick it out added weight to the grudge
he already had against them on the score
of Alpin having been a soldier. He had
CASH AND CARRY.
JACKEROO: “Gib it kiss, Mary.”
MARY : “Gib it tchillin’.”
J ACKEROO: “Oh, I bin (gib tchillin' to your man Jacky .”
MARY: “You bin (gib it tchillin' Jacky, you kiss Jacky.”
let them know his feelings early, and since
then had seen nothing of them except that
Alpin rode past from time to time.
He came out to the door of the dairy as
Alpin pushed open the small whitewashed
gate. Sight of the soldier’s tunic, frayed
and blackened from use among the fire-
scorched timber on the clearing, helped to
fan up his smouldering hate, which was not
diminished by the fact that Alpin, despite
his present haggardness, looked stronger and
healthier than the gas-marked man who had
gone out to that selection twelve months
earlier.
His small eyes glowing with a dulled
lambency, the old German settler pointed
to the gate. “Ged oud,” he said. “Ged oud
bevor I ged mine gun an’ schood you!”
“For God’s sake, listen.” Alpin held up
his right hand with the fist closed. “It’s the
wife. She’ll die if we don’t get her away.”
“Vife! Vife! Do plazes mit you vife!
Ged out uv mine blace. I am nod you vife’s
modder!”
“I tell you she’ll die. It’s a baby. She’s
going to have a baby!”
“You don’ say!” Klaus was chuckling
inwardly, but the desperate man in front of
him saw only the grim hate glowing in
the greenish-grey eyes and the square chin
and rugged mouth set like a rock. It was
a supreme moment for Klaus, one he’d have
given half his scrubber herd to own. He
did not waste it. “You midghd dake her in
do Binbobbin on der vrund uv der saddle.
Ach! Id’s only dwendy-nine mile!”
The goad stung. “You swine!” Alpin
shouted. “You know I can’t get her into
Binbobbin. A woman can die out there on
her own and you won’t lend a hand! I
wanted you to let your wife or your girl go
out whiie I rode on to Lowrie’s to ring for
the doctor.”
“Veil, id’s only anoder vordeen mile do
Lowrie. Ged oud uv mine blace an’ ride id!”
The lanky ex-soldier clutched his hands,
trying to hold back his rage, and made
a final plea. “You know I wouldn’t see you
stuck like this.” he said. “It’s terrible seri-
ous or I wouldn’t be standing here asking
you. She got bad all of a sudden. She’s
white as a ghost and can’t move. Are you
going to help?”
But he was up against something that
knew no chivalry, the dull hatred of a dull
mind, nursed and nourished for years,
against all who fought in the war that took
his only son, who happened to be in the
Fatherland when it broke out. And he was
against something even deeper than that. The
memory of it came to Klaus now. There
had been no consideration for his feelings
or for what was at stake when the police
came with the order that he had to go into
the concentration camp. They had not spared
him even though Wilhelmina, the little
golden-haired six-year-old that came to him
late in his life, was on her death-bed. They
were so officious in the grip of their feverish
spy-mania that he knew they wouldn’t have
gone without him even if they had heard her
crying from pain in the night.
His hatred blazed out now with a sudden-
ness that took Alpin by surprise. “You!
You!” he shouted. “Ach! der whole tam lod
uv you!” He stepped suddenly back into
the dairy and took the shotgun off the nail
behind the door. “Ged oud !” he reiterated.
“Ged oud uv mine blace before I schood you !”
Thought of the sick woman on the bed
of their slab hut saved Alpin’s rage from
mastering him and, perhaps, saved his life.
With strong hands clenching and opening,
he turned, went through the gate and on
toward the sliprails.
The frail little woman, brown and skinny
from years of ceaseless slavery among the
cows, came out from her hiding-place in the
bails.
“Vod are you doing mit der gun, Harz?”
she asked.
Klaus, watching Alpin mount his horse
and swing along the unmade road toward
Lowrie’s, did not answer, and Mrs. -Klaus
went on into the dairy and emptied her
bucket of milk into the separator vat. When
she came out again, as Anna, big-boned and
fresh-cheeked, came up from turning the cows
into the night paddock, Klaus, gun under
his arm, was making across the clearing
toward the heavy timber that came down
their side of Grey Mount and just now bore
the golden mantle of the setting sun high
on its leafy roof.
Klaus walked on. His wife and Anna
could do the separating. He had had a little
honey mixed with the gall of his heart and
he wanted to get, away and gloat on it.
Entering the fringe of the forest, he kept
his face turned upward, scanning among the
gums for a sign of animal or bird life. Fifty
yards in he discerned in the semi-gloom the
round, fluffy bundle of a native bear on one
of the lower limbs of a great stringybark.
He halted, lifted the gun and fired. For a
few seconds the echoes reverberated through
the trees and the blue smoke hung between
him and his prey. When the smoke cleared,
he saw the bear still on the limb, wounded,
making clumsy efforts to get higher. Pre-
sently it slipped, but it clung desperately
to the limb, and held itself in a fork against
the main trunk. There it began to claw at
its wounds and, that failing to ease them,
it began to cry.
In all his twenty years in the Bush, it
was the first wounded bear Klaus had ever
heard. He almost doubted that it was the
bear, so painfully, poignantly human was the
cry that came down to him. It was the
cry of a child, of a sick child suffering ex-
cruciating pain; a cry that no combination
of letters in any language could convey to
the ear. It kept repeating, a new cry rising
out of the stricken thing before the previous
one had died away, so that it became one
long, piteous pleading. Suddenly Klaus
knew —it was pleading to be dead. He lifted
the gun. and pulled the trigger, heard the
dead, faint click of the hammer. The other
barrel had been empty!
Lowering the gun, he stood looking at the
claw’ing, crying bundle in the fork. For the
first time since the bitterness warped his
soul he wanted to do a human act. He took
up a stone and threw it, but it landed dully
against the tree-trunk yards below the brown
creature whose cry was now rising on a
shriller, more pitifully penetrating note. As
the cry rose, keening through the trees, it
became intimate, familiar, touching remem-
brance.
He was sitting on an old kerosene-box,
holding the twitching hand of little Wil-
helmina, with the candle throwing its splut-
tering light across the bed. Her tiny gold
head moved from side to side on the pillow.
She was crying, crying from pain, like this
dying creature in its tree. The police who
came to take him away to the concentration-
camp next morning had not heard that cry-
ing. If they had, perhaps they might not
have taken him. He had never admitted
the thought before, but now, with the pitiful
crying in the tree growing fainter, it became
probable, feasible, even natural. And when
he had had word from a visitor to- the camp
that she wak dead he had not sought per-
mission to go to her. Instead he had nursed
the news away as fuel for
his hate.
He heard a swishing in
the air. caught a glimpse
of the falling thing, heard
the muffled thud where it
fell, a few yards from his
feet. * The bear lay still.
It had ceased to cry. He
knew it was dead, and did
not question why he should
feel grateful for that. He
left it there, and went back
with the empty gun.
Crossing the log over the
creek at the pigsties he
thought of the man he had
threatened to shoot not an
hour before. Then he
thought of Alpin’s wife.
Her hair was fluffy, a
golden flufliness, and Wil-
lielmina’s had been like
that. It used to fluff up
in the wind as she ran
about the paddock after
the poddies.
He bore off to the left,
toward the paddock beyond
the sorghum patch. He let
down the sliprails, drafted
the old grey mare away
from her nearly-grown foal
and the piebald, and drove
her up to the yard adjoin-
ing the bails. Then, from
the lean-to at the back of
the dairy, he brought out
the spring-cart harness.
Mrs. Klaus, putting her
shrivelled old face out the
back door, saw him back-
ing t;lie harnessed mare
into the shafts, and, though
she guessed accurately the
destination, she did not
wholly understand. She
decided to find out, and,
taking a bucket on pre-
tence of returning it to the
dairy, passed yards closer
to him than was strictly
necessary.
“I vant you der com mit
me,” Klaus said, without
looking up from the trace
he was fastening to its
hook.
“Ah, Harz,” she said, “I
vill pe pack in a momend.”
She went back to the
house hurriedly, taking the
bucket with her. When
she came out again she
threw a bundle into the
back of the cart and clam-
bered up over the front
step.
Outside the sliprails Klaus headed the old
mare toward Alpinls, and beat her up into
a lolloping trot with his long willow switch.
They bounced side by side in absolute silence
over the two miles of rugged bush road
till the light, coming thinly through the open
door of the hut, fell on the near wheel of
the cart. Then Klaus got down and began
a minute investigation of each of the old
mare’s hoofs.
“She bicked ub a sdone in von vood,” he
grumbled.
“Ah, Harz,” the woman said, lugging the
bundle with her out of the cart, “vill I go
in?”
“She bicked ub a sdone,” Klaus persisted,
and, accepting that as an affirmation, she
went in through the narrow doorway, around
the end of the half-finished partition, and
into the room where the fluffy, golden hair
adorned the pillow about the ghastly-white
face. There she put down the bundle and
spoke. But her voice had changed. It
might have been another woman’s. It had
become soft, crooning; her harsh consonants,
still apparent, were yet melting. She bent
over the sick woman.
“Prave liddle von, id is soon offer. I vill
help you. I am a nurse. I vos drain in
Chermany.”
A moan escaped the thin lips of the
sick woman, but she gripped the other’s
hand and -whispered relief and gratitude.
“Oh—the pain !” she whispered. “Than —
thanks, Mrs. Klaus. Dick said you might—
come when I was so—so bad.”
The old nurse stroked her forehead, press-
ing down the temples, comforting her. “I
haf doo hod pags here,” she said. “I vill
fill dese ven der vatter is hod. I can hear
Harz light der vire”——
When, nearly two hours later, Klaus heard
the clip-clop of a horse’s hoofs on the bush
road he went out from looking at the little
bundle of new-born humanity to which his
wife was trying to attract the mother’s
slightly dazed, bewildered thoughts. As
the jaded horse with Alpin in the saddle
drew closer he began taking up each of the
old mare’s hoofs in turn, and was scratching
with a stick at a perfectly clean frog of the
off-hind hoof when Alpin peered down to
make sure who it was.
“You’re —you’re here !” Alpin gasped. “Is
everything all right? How’s my wife?”
Without looking up, Klaus went on
scratching at the hoof. “She bicked ub a
sdone in von vood,” he grumbled.
CECIL MANN.


The Royal Morning.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I THREW my palace window wide
And gazed upon my kingdom side,
Where, fondled by the lights of dawn,
Lay leafy park and ordered lawn,
The terraced vineyard on the steep,
Long orchards green and leafy deep,
And castled heights of old grey stone
Whose casements flamed against my own.
The gilded curtains round me swayed
To the new breeze the sunrise made;
And flute and reed to sound awoke
In avenues of royal oak.
I heard the splash of fountains near,
Far voices sounded shrill and clear;
And market wheels went rattling down
The high king’s causeway to the town.
All this was mine by right of birth,
A wide domain of conquered earth.
All these were mine—the singing maid,
The man who bent above a spade,
The man who drove a gleaming share
And whistled in the morning air,
The cattle seen between the trees,
The browsing sheep, the questing bees;
And every stroke from that good axe
Was subject to my royal tax,
Where labor laid the forest low
To teach the yellow corn to grow.
I sighed across the gracious
whole
That bore the imprint of my
soul;
With benison of moving lips
I turned away to gather chips
To set my morning fire aflame.
I wore no crown, I bore no
name
That men might hold in heavy
dread;
Yet singing in my regal head
Was that refrain of empery—
“All men are kings of all they
see.”
In fretful pomp pale monarchs
wait
The bidding of their lords of
State ;
But he is set all lords above
Who holds a realm in thoughts
of love
And, kin to all things fair and
kind,
Deals justice with a kingly
mind.
Unbribed by fortune and un-
bought
By any chance the years have
brought,
He judges on a perfect plan
The simple cause of every man.
The best in each that he can see
Before his, throne is solemn plea
To that large mercy which can
give
The bread of faith by which to
live.
With joy I gathered treasure
trove
Of bark, and lit my palace
stove,
Knowing the happy smoke
would rise
As incense to the morning skies,
And that a courtly day would
shine
With gems and gold that all
were mine
And feast and music of good
words
Between white flowers and nest
ing birds.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Although the spencer
family lived peaceful,
amiable lives, below the
surface was a deep-seated little
source of dissension.
John Spencer had in the
early days of his married life
claimed the reservation of one
night a week exclusively for his own private
purposes. Where and how he spent that
had been the subject of much specu-
lation on the part of his family; and although
it had become as much an item of domestic
routine as the call of the morning milkman,
always in the background lurked a suspicion
that those hours were not spent according
to respectable family traditions.
On this night John Spencer stayed at home
and retired to his den, while the family sat
in secret conclave on the voluntary abandon-
ment of his ancient privilege. He had just
settled down to the enjoyment of an extra
cigar when his daughter Diana came to the
door.
“Can you spare me a few minutes,
Father?” she asked.
“Certainly, my dear, as many as you
want.”
She came into the room and perched herself
on the arm of his chair.
“Dad, why aren’t you and I pals?”
“Pals? Pals? Does not my parental status
—the —er —relationship of father and child
—really, my dear, what do you mean
by pals?”
“Friends, companions, sharer of each
other’s virtues —and vices.”
“Vices?”
“Yes,” she replied airily. “Haven’t you
any?”
“I suppose I have. It’s rather difficult
these days to distinguish between the off-
spring of good and evil. The vice of yester-
day is so often the virtue of to-day.”
“I have made a great discovery, Dad.
You’re something more than a father—
you’re quite human !”
“Well! Well! What a discovery!”
“And I am human, too,” said Diana.
“Pleased to meet you. Two in the same
family! What about your mother and the
others?”
“They’re only clocks, collections of wheels
and springs, always doing the same things,
with little cuckoo chimes always saying the
same things.”
“And do you—do different things?”
“That’s why I’ve invaded your sanctuary.
I have sinned, and the burden of my sinning
draws me to a Father Confessor.”
“My dear, count your sins over in the dark
hours of the night, and treasure them.
Thank the good God that you have the
courage to sin.”
“The courage to sin! Father, I’m sur-
prised !”
“Even after your amazing discovery that
I am human? Doesn’t it require courage to
step off the roadways prepared for us? To
climb over the boundary hedges?”
“We must not climb over them, only peep
through the gaps.”
“Is that the code of your Ethical Society?”
“Father” —she ignored his thrust —“I do
want to tell you something.”
“You really want to confess?”
“I do,” she said.
“All your sins to date?”
“All of them —without reservation.”
“Begin with the smallest.”
“I don’t obey the fifth Commandment.”
“Which one is that?”
THE MARTYR.
NEW PARSON : “Thirty years verger of this one church! You must have seen many
ministers in your time.”
THE VERGER : “Ten on 'em all told; good preachers an’ bad preachers—most on ’em bad.
I’ve heard ’em all: but, thank God, I’m still a Christian.”
“I don’t respect my parents properly. 1
am beginning to think mother is a little bit
of a humbug—the sweetest of”
“I made that discovery years ago, but, as
you say, a delectable humbug.”
“I deceive her outrageously,” said Diana.
“So do I.”
“Why, Dad?”
“Am I in the confessional-box?” he pro-
tested.
“Is it a sin to deceive rather than hurt?”
“It is, my dear, but such a little one that
the recording angel has no pen fine enough
to write it down.”
“This is the big one, Dad. My—my
regular Tuesday night at the Ethical Society
is a blind. I don’t go there.”
“That grieves me much. I thought the
Ethical Society had relieved me of responsi-
bility for your morals.”
“I go to dinner at doubtful cafes.”
“Dear, dear! Alone?”
“So far. always alone.”
“For what purpose?”
“To watch and listen to real sinners.”
“Applied ethics? Practical illustrations
of your lectures?”
“Yes, Dad. I learn much more there than
from books and lectures.”
“No one has interfered with you?”
“No. But I have become very interested
in an unknown man.”
"Ah ! I thought there would be a man in
the case!”
“I sit in a little alcove from which I can
watch him without being seen.”
“Reticence, Diana, is the handmaid of
wisdom.”
"He has never seen me there.”
“And you want to speak to him—the urge
towards a soul-mate?”
"No. Sympathy. He seems so lonely.”
“That is a dangerous pretext for inti-
macy.”
“He comes every Tuesday night to the
Rienzi.”
“The Rienzi? Yes. I have heard of
it—a disreputable establishment. And —er
—Tuesday nights, you say?”
“Always on Tuesday, your night off. Dad.
He sits at a little table set for two; but the
other seat is never occupied. He takes a long
time over his dinner, listens to the music,
and watches people with a quizzical smile.
And drinks something, a lot of it—out of a
teapot.”
“Tea, I suppose?”
“No. It’s darker than tea, and with each
cup you can sec the stiffness going out of
him. He —lie —mellows. I’m sure it must
be wine.”
“It may be. Since Parliaments have
decided what, when and how we shall eat
and drink, such little deceptions have been
practised.”
“I want to sit at his table some night and
see what happens.”
“Is he young?”
“Yes—and no. One of those men who will
nover be old. except in years.”
“A dangerous type, very dangerous!”
“Would it be wrong for me to sit at his
table ?”
“He might resent the intrusion.”
“Then I would never join him again.”
“He might want you to share his—tea-
pot.”
“I would take only one tiny little cupful.”
“He might unduly hasten your acquisition
of —er —ethical knowledge.”
“I would select the theme of conversation.”
“You would. Women always do!”
“If you were in my place, Dad, what would
you do ?”
“I would walk as if passing his table,
hesitate, and then say ‘Somebody has taken
my usual seat. May I?’ ”
* * * *
The following Tuesday night saw John
Spencer at his usual seat at the Rienzi. A
simply but charmingly dressed girl, walking
past his table, hesitated.
“Somebody has taken my usual seat,” she
said. “May I?”
“Charmed, Mademoiselle,” he replied, rising
and bowing gracefully.
“I thought perhaps you might have been
expecting someone.”
“Not at all. And I have no legal claim to
two seats.”
The waiter paused at their table and
proffered a menu-card to Diana, who dis-
played unexpected proficiency in selecting her
dinner.
“I can recommend the savory as an appro-
riate finale to a well-selected dinner,” said
John.
“Very well, waiter—and a savory to
finish with.”
As the waiter withdrew, Diana half turned
in her chair and studied the other diners
in the room. Her father watched her with
a new interest.
“As circumstances decree that we dine to-
gether, may I —talk?” he queried.
“It would not be improper.”
“Only if I had come to your table,” said
John.
“I have often seen you dining here alone.”
“A harmless pastime of veterans —out of
the race.”
"I came to your table deliberately.”
“Then I am not yet a veteran.”
“The vacant chair opposite you, it fasci-
nated me. I felt sure that some night it
would be occupied.”
"It always has been.”
“By ghosts?”
“By some beautiful woman—a creation of
memory and imagination.”
“Always the same woman?”
“Alas, no! Each night a fresh one!”
“I have a similar gift of imagination,” said
Diana. “I often dine with an imaginary
companion.”
“And your taste is cosmopolitan also?”
“No. Safely prosaic. Always the same
man.”
“Can you describe him to me?”
“Not to-night,”
“Have some of my—tea.”
“Just one tiny cupful.”
“There may be other nights?”
“I hope so.”
“But the other man?”
“You are so like him”
“Subtle flattery is a danger-
ous gift in one so young.”
“I like your tea.”
“It is brewed from a special
leaf grown in the Garden of
Allah.”
They both watched the
sparkling bustle of the scene as
the waiter arrived with the first
instalment of Diana’s dinner.
"Why do you come to this
caf6” she asked.
“To watch the pageant of
youth. The pulsation of pri-
mitive impulses around here
makes me warm. Warmth is
comforting to veterans. But
you, why are you here?”
“Curiosity. A desire to know
and perhaps understand those
who do not live to schedule —
those who disregard ‘Thou
slmlts’ and ‘Thou slialt nots,’
who step over the boundaries.”
“Not that you would abolish
boundaries, I venture to hope?”
lie asked with concern.
“Would that be very terrible?
I thought you said it took cour-
age to sin.”
“There must be a boundary
somewhere. A line where good
ends.”
“Can you tell me where that
line is?”
“No one can do that, dear
lady. The line is not rigid;
but there is a limit to its elas-
ticity.”
“You mean that what is evil
to one may be good to another?”
“Not exactly. I mean that
while goodness, virtue, what-
ever you call it, may be rela-
tive rather than positive, it
exists.”
“Each according to her
nature?”
“Something like that. Each
according to that intuitive whis-
per which in moments of crisis
says, ‘You’ve reached the
limit!’ ”
“Where does the whisper
come from?”
“Now we pass to metaphysics
—just as the savories and coffee
arrive.”
“The first dinner with a man
should be serious.”
“Why?”
“Because it determines
whether there are to be others.
Why, what’s the matter?”
John was gazing with frank
astonishment at the other end
of the cafd.
“By the beard of the Prophet!” he ex-
claimed.
“More ghosts?” she asked, half turning.
“Don’t look round till I tell you,” he
said. “They are being shown to a quiet
little corner at the other end.”
“Who?”
“A matronly lady, tall and fair, in a black
evening frock. She looks very charming, but
frightened.”
“Alone?”
“No —a man! By Jove, it is! Canon
Mansfield, of Trinity Church, in mufti!”
Diana looked round quickly, and then
shrank back in her chair.
“How horrible ! It’s Mother!”
“Horrible? Cannot their boundaries be
elastic?”
“You’re not shocked?” gasped Diana.
“Of course not. I’m pleased. Don’t you
see? She’s human, too!”
“But the Canon?”
“Bless her heart,” he chuckled. “I’ll go
to his church next Sunday. But I’ll take
his place at the next dinner.”
“They—they’re supposed to be at a bazaar
committee meeting!”
“That’s it. They’re holding the meet-
ing here.”
“I am shocked, if you’re not,” said Diana.
“Then your boundaries are rigid?”
“What I do and what Mother does arc
different things. Why, at her age!”
“Let us join them and make a foursome.”
“No, no! Tell me when I can slip away
without being seen.”
“Now’s your chance,” he exclaimed, smil-
ing. “Wait for me outside.”
“Funny old world, isn’t it, Fritz.” he said
as he fumbled in his pocket for change.
“It’s as one makes it, sir,” replied Fritz.

AT A WINDOW IN PARADISE.


The Great Lady.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WITHIN the mouldy castle walls
The Lady Winifred,
With silken whispers to her gown
And pearls upon her head—
A village wench of humble birth
My lord had raised, to share his worth
And name, the gossips said.
And haughty was her straight, blue look,
And lofty was her mien;
And every word she spoke was dipped
In ice. No proud, young queen
Could bear more pride within her breast,
Nor, gracious-mannered, less suggest
What she had lately been.
The knights and ladies came to sit
When the first feast was spread,
And nudged and peeked to see the girl
My lord had stooped to wed.
But “She is fit to wear his name!”
They told themselves, and turned their blame
To love and praise instead.
She took their homage as her due,
With grace that scorned all art,
Moving among the glittering throngs
As one who dwelt apart;
But, stitching at her tapestries,
She often heard the moorland breeze
Wailing around her heart.
A smile was set along her lips;
The pearls were on her head.
My lord looked down and saw the bloom
Upon her cheeks was fled.
“What ails you in this lovely place,
The light has died within your face?”
“I am not ill,” she said.
She watched the festive flowers that piled
The dusky-panelled hall,
The pillars ivied to the roof,
The lights along the wall;
And saw herself move like a ghost,
Silent among that happy host,
A stranger ’mid them all.
NO ATTRACTION FOR HIM.
OLD RESIDENT : “Hch, mister, ’ave you seen
a bawley-lookin’ mare with one eye, a
lump out of the off ear and a scraggy
tail?”
SATIATED TOURIST : “Thank you, I haven’t,
and don’t want to. I’m not a bit in-
terested in freaks.”
A maid from out the village came,
Bringing her silken thread,
To mend my lady’s torn white gown
Before the feast was spread.
And looked with awe to see her there,
Standing with marbled shoulders bare
And pearls upon her head.
She talked, with modest, downcast eyes,
Drawing her needle through,
Of tales that came from London Town,
Of things the gossips knew,
Of lads that danced at dawn of day,
Looping the ribbons into May;
Of roystering gallants, too.
Then laughed aloud with rosy lips
The Lady Winifred,
Her silken skirts above the floor,
The pearls upon her head.
Shedding their veils of misty dream,
Her eyes like stars were all a-gleam.
“Tell me what else!” she said.
How long since the white hawthorn snowed
The old coach-road to Town?
Who held the sweating horses now
Outside the George and Crown?
And, where the sun wove out and in,
Still flicked the trout a startled fin
Among the shallows brown?
The little village sewing-maid
Snapped off a slender thread.
“The frost was bitter-black this year,
The lambs lay stiff,” she said.
“Old Meg beside the turnip-ditcli
(Folks rightly said she was a witch —
God rest her soul!) is dead!”
“And do the lads and lasses go
Still down the Lovers’ Lane?
Does Pete the Piper tune his flute
Alike in sun and rain?
And Grandfer Hodges—let me see,
He must be now all ninety-three!”
My lady laughed again.
My lord climbed up the winding stair—
The merry feast was spread.
He saw her stand all rosy there,
The pearls upon her head.
She took with icy hand his flower.
“I have been happy for an hour —
One little hour!” she said.
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
Cranking Backwards.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PROFESSOR BARRINGTON exhibited
some irritation at the third interrup-
tion, but told the maid to show the
visitor up.
“He has a card from .Teplicott. I suppose
I must see him,” he said, turning again to
me and resuming the discussion. “As I was
saying, Spragg, the surest historical evidence
is always to be found in the contemporary
work which does not profess to treat of
history. It is as if Darwin, in ‘The Origin
of Species,’ had mentioned a number of
facts about current political events. We
should be tolerably certain that his state-
ments were correct, because the facts would
be known to his readers, and he could have
no possible object in falsifying them. Thus,
if we could find a Latin manuscript on the
newly-introduced art of glass-blowing in
which there was a reference to Caesar’s
death it would be infinitely more reliable
than the tale afterwards written by Plu-
tarch.”
Before I had time to point out that the
glass-blo'wer’s knowledge would probably be
as unreliable as most current gossip the door
opened and the maid announced young Ripon.
The Professor rose and offered him a
chair.
“Mr. Ripon, this is Dr. Spragg.”
“Glad to meet you,” said Ripon with a
mild blink through his spectacles.
The Professor leaned towards him, his
elbows on his knees and the tips of his
fingers pressed together.
“I’ve come to try to sell you a car, Pro-
fessor.”
Barrington looked momentarily distressed,
but, recovering himself, smiled and shook his
head.
"I am already provided with one,” he said.
“Yes, yes,” said the young man, moving
a little uneasily in his seat; “but this is
not an ordinary car. It has some unusual
features. It is entirely my own invention”—
here he mildly blushed —“and its peculi-
arity is that it is self-directed, uses time
as a motive-power and carries its occupants
accurately to any crossing-point of chron-
ology and geography which may be * indi-
cated.”
The Professor looked at me with a twisted
smile, and the young man evidently noted
his action.
“Of course you will say that is insane.
I have no wish to have you believe it with-
out a trial.”
“Chronology and geography?” said the
Professor. "I’m afraid I don’t quite under-
stand.”
“It’s quite simple, sir,” said Ripon in a
tone of utmost sincerity. “When the
geographical position and the exact date can
be fixed, two buttons are pressed and the
mechanism does the rest.”
“You mean that you can drive backward
into history.”
‘‘Exactly. I have just returned from a
short visit to the battle of Hastings; and to
Hastings I went direct from a spot chosen
at random in 1362.”
“Let me see; what happened in 3362?”
Young Ripon waved his hand.
“I believe there were some matters of
importance in connection with the inroads
of the Turks; but I did not bother to look
them up. I chose 3 p.m. on Christmas Eye,
old time, and a spot in the English Mid-
lands.”
“And -what did you find?”
The Professor seemed interested in spite
of the absurdity of the statement, and I felt
myself coming under some subtle spell which
young Ripon exerted.
“Nine fat friars singing while they plucked
geese. I believe they were singing in early
English, but I could not understand a word.
I know they laughed a good deal and the
feathers fell into wooden buckets. There was
no snow, but the ground was hard with
frost. Now will you give the car a trial?”
The Professor stood up and shook himself
till his stiff collar rattled.
“Spragg, am I insane?”
“I think so,” I said. “I know I’m feeling
a lack of mental balance. I should like to
give the machine a trial.”
Young Ripon laughed delightedly.
“You’ll find it’s all I say, Dr. Spragg.”
“Where is this —what did you call it?”
“The chronomobile. I have it at the door.”
“You drive the thing in the street?”
“Oh, yes. We must take off somewhere.
It looks very much like any other car.”
“Where shall we
go?” said the Pro-
fessor. There was
a strange, set look
in his eyes.
“Try the porch
of Pompey’s
Theatre, Rome, the
Ides of March,
44 b.c.”
“The very thing!”
cried Barrington.
“Do we need our
overcoats?”
“Hardly,” I said;
Rome is mild enough
in March. It might
be a good idea to
carry a revolver,
though.”
“Impossible, Doc-
tor !” young Rippon
spoke with great
emphasis. “T h e
revolver was not
invented then. You
would never get it
there.”
“Then I suppose
we should leave
our watches —in
fact, our boots and
trousers would be
rather an anachro-
nism in that period.”
“Oh, no! You
will find them all
safe enough when
you return; but
you may miss some
of the articles
when you are actu-
ally in Rome. If
you want weapons, better carry knives.”
After a little discussion we decided to wear
light overcoats and bathing costumes: and
the Pi-ofessor made a descent to the kitchen
and returned with two carving-knives and
a small meat-cleaver. The latter he handed
solemnly to Ripon.
“Oh, never mind me, Professor!” he said.
“I’m not afraid.”
A certain gravity had come upon the whole
party as we went down the stairs. At the
last step Barrington turned to me.
“Are w r e mad, Spragg?”
“Beyond all doubt,” I said. “Carry on !”
Young Ripon led us to the car, which,
though outwardly much like any other car,
had a complicated arrangement of screws,
buttons and numbered discs in front of the
driver’s seat. It took several minutes to
adjust things, but at last all was ready.
“Now,” said Ripon, “hang on to your
intelligence and we’ll be there inside a
minute.”
We shot down Elizabeth-street, turned
into Bathurst-street, crossed Castlereagh-

ESTELLE : “Er — yes. And a few words mumbled over your pillow and, you're divorced."
street and were descending the slope between
the Capitoline and the Palatine almost before
we realised the change in the nature of the
buildings and the contour of the ground.
Above us and close at hand towered the
temple of Jupiter; behind us the Forum
sounded like the dying roar of a thousand
bookmakers. Masts of ships rose from the
river on our left as we turned under the
shoulder of the Capitoline; and slaves ran
hither and thither —n\ost of them half-naked
-—with small bundles poised on head and
shoulder. Smells of fish —fresh and decayed
in equal proportions—fruit, sweetmeats and
oil seemed to fill the air. On the right an
unwilling and angry sacrificial bullock was
being dragged and prodded up a steep in-
cline. The higher ledges of the rocky hill
seemed to be reached by steps as steep as
ladders; and up and down these was moving
a motley array of people, all shouting, all
gesticulating and all in a hurry.
The car swung into a more open place,
and the crowd, catching one glimpse of it,
shrieked, bent before the menace of it
like trees in a gale, and ran helter-skelter
for cover. The wheels suddenly ceased to
turn at a broad-columned porch of whitish
sandstone.
“Here we are,” said young Ripon. “We’re
right on time. The murder is going on in-
side.”
Without pausing to consider anything but
the marvel of the moment, and grasping my
long Joseph Rodgers carving-knife under
my overcoat, 1 ran up the steps and found
my way between the columns. Right before
my eyes was the scene of the great tragedy
—a tangled mass of people fighting, some
in wrestling grips, some rolling and clawing
on the floor.
For a moment the entrance from the bright
A SURE SIGN.
“How did you know I wantcd soup?—I haven't given my order yet."
“No, sir; hut you’ve got a moustache.”
sunlight to the shade of the porch made
the figures dim and uncertain ; but when I
was able to see clearly, the picture that met
my eyes stirred me to sudden action. Right
in the centre of the howling group stood
Professor Barrington. There was no mis-
taking his tall figure and bald head, though
how T he had got there before me I could not
guess. Somehow in the rough-up a wreath
of green stuff had fallen sideways over his
left temple; and even as I looked it lost its
precarious hold and dangled from his ear.
Evidently he was enjoying the battle. His
fists shot right and left; and then, as a burly
ruffian pressed upon him, I saw him reach
to a pedestal behind him, pull down a bronze
bust and dash it hard at his assailant.
“Et tu, Brute!” I heard him shout as
bust and man went rolling to the stone floor.
“Hold on, Barrington,” I yelled. “I’m
coming into this.”
I waved the stainless steel of my weapon
on high and pressed forward to his side.
One glance at that Sheffield blade caused
the battle to break with a howl; but even
as I made my triumphant passage through,
a fresh mob of Dagoes seemed to gather
from every quarter.
“For heaven’s sake get out of this, Bar-
rington,” I cried. “Where’s Cfesar, anyhow,
and what’s it all about?”
I grasped his arm and pushed him back
between the columns. He went unwillingly
at first; but the howl of the mob behind us
soon rose to such volume that he took the
lead and we did a fast sprint through an
archway and down a deserted street. At
last we took shelter in a deep doorway and
paused for breath.
“Barrington,” I said, “how on earth did
you get into this?”
He looked at me strangely and answered
in an unknown tongue. Afterwards I real-
ised that he spoke Latin —spoke it with an
accent and intonation I had never expected.
My schoolboy Latin was too remote and
scattered to be mustered for such an occa-
sion.
“What’s wrong, old man?” I asked; and
as I spoke my eyes fell to his feet and I saw
that he was wearing sandals.
My own feet were bare. My overcoat had
lost its buttons, and my blue bathing-costume
showed beneath it. Barrington seemed to
be swathed in several yards of flannel that
had been torn and ripped in the recent con-
flict.
My exclamations of surprise were drowned
in the renewed uproar that broke forth from
the place we had left. Barrington seemed
greatly agitated and talked incessantly and
incomprehensibly. Fugitives began to rush
down the street. They shouted as they ran,
but did not look to the right or left. When
the first rush was over, a large person—an
Oriental of some sort—came slowly through
a doorway and began to waddle towards the
place where the noise had been loudest. He
wore a green robe and a bright blue turban.
Then Barrington did an amazing thing. I
saw him stiffen up and make a sudden cat-
like spring. His left fist shot out and took
the Asiatic accurately on the point of the
jaw ; and as the large person sprawled in the
dust he tore off turban and robe and began
feverishly to re-clothe himself in them. Even
I should have had difficulty in recognising
him when the disguise was complete.
Utterly confounded by the turn of events,
and convinced that the Professor was entirely
mad, I took him by the arm and endea-
vored to lead him in the direction opposite
to that of the late commotion ; but he refused
to be taken that way. Instead, he forced
me to retrace my steps until we reached the
archway through which we had at first
bolted. Here, turning to the left, he drew
me up a short stairway which opened upon a
long, narrow balcony. Peering over the
breast-high parapet, we looked down into the
very hall where the riot had taken place
from a height of not more than a dozen feet.
And then a mixed madness of horror and
terror possessed me as I began to realise the
thing that had really happened. On some
kind of white-draped platform immediately
below us lay my friend Professor Barrington,
cold and dead. Three or four solemn figures
were moving about the bier, adding a finish-
ing touch to the draping; and onr of these
raised his arms and seemed to swear silently.
I looked to the man at my side and again
at the cold face below me. One was in
every respect the exact counterpart of the
other. In my haste and carelessness I had
saved Julius Caesar and allowed my friend
Professor Barrington to be done to death
in his stead!
Anger surged within me. For a single
second I could have stabbed the great dic-
tator with stainless steel: but when I looked
at him again my anger died. Surely it was
Barrington! His very gesture as he raised
a hand to brush a fly from liis nose was that
of my dead friend.
I sighed and grasped his arm; and this
time he suffered himself to be led towards
the porch, where I expected to find the car.
•Armed men were guarding the space within,
but outside the streets seemed utterly de-
serted and the vehicle which had so swiftly
wheeled us back from the twentieth century
was nowhere to be seen. As I searched with
my eyes every possible corner in which it


might be standing 1 felt my sleeve touched
and turning saw young Ripon.
“They smashed it up,” he whispered.
“Smashed it!”
“Yes; after they had killed Caesar.”
“How can we get back?”
“I’ll have to build another one.”
“Do you know that this insane trip has
cost Professor Barrington his life?”
“His life? How?”
He looked curiously at my companion and
blinked smilingly behind his glasses, think-
ing it a joke.
“It’s true.” I said. “Barrington is lying
in there dead. This is Julius Caesar. They’re
as like as two peas. Caesar got off and Bar-
rington was killed.”
“But, but”
At that moment Ctesar said something in
Latin.
Ripon stared at him in amazement. Sud-
denly he pressed his hands together and
laughed softly.
“It’s all right,” lie said. “People in the
first century b.c. can’t kill a man in the
twentieth century. Why, they’d need knives
twenty-one centuries long.”
I felt my brain beginning to reel.
“Go and look at the body,” I said, “and
don’t talk nonsense.”
“No nonsense, Doctor. He’ll be right the
moment I get the car started. What an
experience lie’s had!”
But Ripon had just had a brain-wave. He
took a notebook from his pocket and began
laboriously to print something in Latin. I
don’t know how much Latin he possessed,
but what lie wrote Caesar understood.
They conversed in this laborious way for
ten minutes or more. Caesar nodded,
smiled, spread out his hands, and finally
seemed to grip the situation.
“Deus ex machina,” he said; and I im-
mediately countered that with “Pro bono

Young Ripon laughed; and Caesar spoke
again, slowly and carefully.
“Come on,” said the inventor. “We’re
going to Ostia. Caesar intends to get a
workshop and help me.”
We have been five days in this tired little
town. Ripon is having the time of his life,
bossing a crowd of slave mechanics. Caesar
has his shirt off, and is working at a lathe.
They tell me the new car will be ready in

The ruffians in Rome burned the body of
Barrington, but an expert Greek stole the

Ripon says he will be as right as rain and
feel no ill effects once the clironomobile gets
moving. He also says that when Julius
and the Professor get together in Sydney
most of the problems of antiquity will be
solved. I have already solved a good many
of them myself, and feel little anxiety to
solve more.

Fortunately I found a postage-stamp in

DAVID MCKEE WEIGHT.
The Royal Salute.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WITH her cables roaring through her
rusty hawse-pipe, the steamer Fan-
taroa came to an anchor within
bos’n hail of Cremorne Point. Her smarter
neighbors, their hulls gleaming with new
paint, their deckhouses immaculate, their
, ’ . , ’ .
brass-work glittering and house flag and
ensign chromatically fresh, served to accen-
tuate the sea-worn appearance of the new
arrival.
The cloud of impalpable red dust raised by
the cable in its noisy passage had scarcely
settled nor the yeasty effervescence of the
surrounding waters subsided before her mas-
ter, dismissing his first mate with a curt
“All right, Mr. Negus,” leaned his elbows on
the bridge railing, and regarded H.M.A.
destroyer Diamantina long and intently
through his binoculars. The binoculars, an
excellent pair by Holland’s of London pre-
sented to the captain by appreciative under-
writers, brought the face of every man on
the destroyer’s deck clearly before his eyes,
A shade of disappointment crossed the
honest, weather-beaten countenance. The
one face he sought so diligently was not
visible.
This was the first time in years that he
had entered a port in which the Diaman-
tina lay and had not been gladdened by the
sight of the trim figure on the destroyer’s
quarter-deck waving a cheery welcome. A
mutual regard, deep as the seas they both
sailed, bound these two men into an in-
dissoluble friendship.
The gregarious instinct was not normally
strong in Captain Streamlyne; but now he
felt that he missed something very acutely.
He was almost always a lonely man. And
now he was aware of it. Standing on his
bridge, from which by the traditional un-
written usage of the sea he should long since
have descended, he fixed his eyes on the Dia-
mantina and fell into a reverie. He recalled
the first time he had seen Masterman....
The mutinous crew. The sudden, murderous
assault on his mate. The rude, futile heroism
of the boatswain. Ilis own appearance
on deck, impotent from the inroads of a
raging malarial attack; the fever in his
veins every now and again driving thick
vapors across his conscious mind, obscuring
almost every inchoate thought before it could
be developed into an intelligent, rational
idea. And the timely appearance of Master-
man, who not only subdued the insurrection
but managed to turn it into a comedy.
With one more look at the Diamantina
Captain Streamlyne came out of his medi-
tation, and, bethinking himself of the affairs
that awaited his attention, descended to the
chart-room.
The next day, contrary to his expecta-
tions, there came no word or sign from
Masterman, so Captain Streamlyne called
for his gig and was rowed over to the de-
stroyer.
“Captain aboard?” lie inquired of the
quartermaster at the gangway.
The man seemed to recognise him. “Yes,
sir,” came the reply, with what appeared
to Streamlyne a certain suggestion of hesi-
tancy.
The quartermaster returned with a young,
fair-haired lieutenant whose face Streamlyne
remembered, although he could not recall
his name.
The lieutenant made no explanation ; but
Streamlyne was quick to discern the young
officer’s troubled manner. Something was
wrong.
“Ah! Captain Streamlyne. How d'ye
do? Come into the ward-room.”
Seated in the ward-room, his host took a
whisky decanter from the fiddled sideboard,
and, placing a glass before the captain and
another for himself, began to charge the
captain’s glass with an unsteady hand.
“Say when, Captain !”
Streamlyne stemmed the too-rcady flow
with an indicative forefinger.
There was a long silence.
“My name’s Traynor. Remember meet-
ing you at Samarai, Captain,” said the
lieutenant.
“Confound the young ass!” thought
Streamlyne, and before he knew he was
capable of it lie heard his own voice jerk
out huskily: “Where’s Masterman ?”
Lieutenant Tray-
nor leaned forward
until his forehead
was received into
the hollow of his
right hand. The
supporting elbow
upset his glass, lie
appeared as oblivi-
ous to this acci-
dent as he did to
Streamlyne’s ques-
tion.
There was an-
other tense silence.
And then a sepul-
chral voice came
seemingly from be-
neath the table; as
startling as the
weird tones that
emanate from the
stage box of a ven-
triloquist. “Master-
man’s been dis-
missed the Ser-
vice,” it croaked.
Deep wrinkles,
new-born to ex-
press Captain
Streamlyne’s tre-
mendous incredu-
lity, appeared upon
his face; then his
hands slid off the table and fell limply on
either side of his chair, as if his brain had
abdicated its sovereignty over muscle and
sinew. “Tell me about it, Mr. Traynor,”
Streamlyne said.
The lieutenant straightened himself, poured
out a generous whisky-soda and drank it.
His mercurial temperament asserted itself.
The heaviness fell from him. and as he
plunged further into his narrative his breezy
manner soon winnowed the melancholy tones
from his speech.
“You remember we were ordered to Singa-
pore, to manoeuvre with the East Indian
Squadron, Captain Streamlyne? Well, one
day the Admiral sent for Masterman. When
he came back from the flagship lie told us
we had to go to a place called Sangor Badok,
in the Celebes. It appeared we were on a
special sort of stunt of a quasi-diplomatic
nature.
“The stunt was a dashed peculiar one. In
fact, when Masterman told me about it at
first I thought he was pulling my leg, and I
asked him if the Admiral’s port and the
tropic sun hadn’t been too much for his
poor old nut. But no ; it was all fair and
above-board. There was a tinpot rajah
down Sangor Badok way, one Tarslute She-
noa Laut, an absolute monarch, it seemed,
and no end of a mighty shogun in his own
country—and in his own estimation. This
old ziff ruled over some half-million subjects,
and, although I don’t pretend to understand
the intricacies of the business, his country
must have been pretty rich in natural re-
sources, and Downing-street was keen after
oil or trading concessions, or both. Our
particular job was to fire a salute, and then
take old Tarslute and his retinue aboard
and carry them over to Sulie Wah, about
200 miles away, where there was some cor-
roborec about a Holy Carpet or something.
The old villain was to be ferried over there
for this show every year, at the expense
and under the protection of the British Gov-
ernment. Failing which, I suppose, no con-
cessions.
“We made Sangor Badok, or, rather, the
offing, just as the tide was going out; and
we had a perfectly hectic time trying to
find enough water to float the old Di. After
we’d been aground for the umteenth time
and we’d cursed old Tarslute and all his
works until we were out of breath, down
the river came his state barge, or prau or
whatever he called it.
MAKING IT CLEAR FOR MARY.
MINISTER: “Will you love, honor and obey?”
M ARY: “Mine tinkit yes.”
TACKY: “Baal ‘Mine tinki[?]! You ask Mary if she bin carry swag for Jacky.”
“Now, as you know, Captain, destroyers
don’t fire salutes—not having saluting bat-
teries. But we were ordered to have salutes
readied up for the old pest, and had taken
on blank rounds at Singapore for the pur-
pose. We cut loose with the rowdiest salute
I’d ever heard. Considering that the
King only gets three-pounders, it seemed
queer making all this thunder for a greasy
old savage like Tafslute. His Highness
came aboard grinning like a Cheshire cat.
The powder-burning had tickled him.
“My hat! You never saw such a mob out-
side comic opera or an Oscar Asclie show,
They were all dressed in the most fantastic
rig with great kreeses stuck through their
red sashes. They kicked up a deuce of a
racket, and there was such a fearful lot of
bowing and scraping that the c.p.o. was hard
put to it to keep straight faces on the guard
of honor. Masterman, the engineer, the sub,
the gunner and I all squeezed into one
state-room, with our dunnage, and gave the
rest of the ward-room over to the Rajah and
his discolored court. I never saw the like
the way we were packed in. Masterman
wanted to get rid of these deadheads as
soon as possible, and whipped the Hi. up to
:U><) revs.; and away the old packet went
hammer and tongs, direct—as we thought—
for Sullie Wah, logging a round 30
k 11()ts
“Now Abar, the Rajah’s Lord Chancellor,
or Grand Vizier, or wliat not, had been
monkeving about the decks, nearly driving
Morant. the gunner’s mate, mad by opening
and closing the breeches of his guns, eleva-
ting and depressing and such like monkey
tricks. Presently he came to the torpedo
tubes. He fetched liis royal master and
illustrated by pantomime the function of a
torpedo. The outcome of it was that Abar
went to Masterman and said the Sultan
would see a torpedo fired. Masterman, who
must have felt like kicking the greasy rogue
off his bridge, tried by every possible means
to get out of it. But oh no! Nothing
would do but a torpedo.
“Masterman thought they’d be good after
this, and as he could run over to Sulie Wah
in under seven hours he piped battle stations,
fired a torpedo, and seht the whaler off to
pick up the tin fish. •' Old Grone, the coxswain
of the whaler, the oldest man in the ship
and a general favorite, fairly threw his crew
into the boat, and got her smartly away,
losing his cap in the excitement. The torpedo
got into a strong southerly current and went
drifting off at about eight knots.
NATURAL HISTORY.
THE NATURALIST : “And the most wonderful thing about
Nature is that the male is always the more beautiful.”
“We soon saw something was wrong with
the whaler. It was yawing all over the
place; and suddenly old Grone, who’ll been
all this time under a blazing tropic sun
without a hat, threw a sixer under the after
thwart. Sunstroke ; and bad at that. Master-
man was raving mad over the whole
business—over the terrible waste of time,
but more than that over poor old Grone,
whom he fairly loved.
We lost three hours over this affair, be-
cause the torpedo had been carried into shoal-
water, where the current ran like a mill-race.
It was nearly sunset when we made
Sulie Wah channel, which is a tortuous
passage that ought only to be tackled in
broad daylight with two leadsmen in the
chains and every precaution against smack-
ing a reef. The glass had been steadily
dropping for an hour or so, and the wind
started to blow great guns just at nightfall,
The sea worked up nasty and confused, and
how the devil we got out of that death-trap,
in the teeth of that gale in pitch-black
darkness and the sea thick with reefs,
Heaven only knows. What I do know is
we were in a fearful pickle. A roaring
hurricane, an almost uncharted sea. and
forty-five people packed into accommodation
intended for five! For four days and nights
that storm kept us pitching about in the
most dangerous waters of the world, and it
is impossible for me to describe how sick to
death we were of those colored gentlemen.
Four sleepless days and nights, and then
at last we got into Sulie and landed the
coons in our own boats in a driving rain.
Three days later we took them on board
again and laid our course for Sangor Badok.
“Poor old Grone had died the night before,
and we stopped the ship about twenty-five
miles from Sulie Wall to send him to ‘the
locker.’ The ship’s company was standing
with heads bowed in genuine grief, and the
only sound was Masterman’s broken voice
almost tearfully reading the burial service,
when those Christy Minstrels started to kick
up the most infernal row on the fo’c’s’le-
liead. Banging cymbals, or tomtoms, or
whatever the gadgets were, and yelling like
fiends. The matlows seemed very upset about
it. The whole thing came as a hor-
rible shock. Perhaps the nigs did not know
what was going on ; or it might even have
been their way of showing respect for the
dead. Whatever it was, it was a very for-
cible reminder to all hands of the trials and
tribulations we had all been put to by this
bunch, and that poor old Grone’s death was
caused, even if indirectly, by them. Morant
-—the gunner’s mate, you know —was so wild
over losing old Grone that if one of those
coves had come near him I believe he’d have
dumped him overboard.
“We made Sangor Badok in fine weather;
Tarslute and his crowd boarded the
prau and rowed ashore, and we fired the
prescribed salute again. Morant’s gun—the
starboard twelve-pounder—was to fire the
last round. I was watching the prau nearing
the shore, and I was thinking what I sup-
pose all hands were thinking—the fearful
irony of wasting the King’s good powder and
paying this extreme respect to a ragtime
monarch who had nearly been the death of
all of us and whom we blamed for one of
our shipmates actually losing the number of
his mess.
“Suddenly the starboard twelve-pounder
fired ; and I nearly jumped out of my skin.
There was no mistaking it —a projectile
had been fired! Morant
was a wonderful gun-
layer. He had the finest
individual gunnery record
in the whole navy, Im-
perial and Australian.
There’s a big rock jut-
ting out of the water at
Sangor Badok, and the
shell burst slap bang on
it—fair and square ’twixt
wind and water. The
prau was just about fiftv
past the rock. Of
course none of them were
injured, as the explosion
was all off-shore; but it
must have scared seven
bells out of them.”
Captain Streamlyne
leaned back and regarded
the lieutenant, a puzzled
expression on his face.
“But why did they
break Masterman over
it?” he asked.
The old weariness re-
turned, and Traynor’s
shoulders slumped forward. His voice lost
its timbre. “It was the gunner’s evidence at
the court-martial that broke Masterman,”
he replied hoarsely.
Streamlyne had to lean forward to catch
the next faint words: “The gunner swore that
as he gave the order to fire he saw Morant
look up to Masterman, who was on the
bridge”
“Yes?”
“Masterman looked down at Morant.”
“Yes?”
“And winked!”

The Ballad of a Coal Lighter.

I T’S a dirty job as I’ve to do—

You fancy craft, if yer only knew!
tiling up that there coal!
No gleamin’ brass or gold-braid duds,
No telescope or a screw that thuds;
An’ me stooard lie talks in beef an spuus.
Gawd! ’Ow I ’ate coal!
Jest dirt an’ grime an’ a black-faced crew.
Flow, old Yarra, flow.
A sawn-off nose an’ the stack askew.
Murky Yarra, flow.
There’s nothin’ neat or trim or tight;
A smudgy glass on me ridin’ light,
An’ me skipper’s pipe is the one thing bright.
Go on, Yarra, flow.
No Golden Gate or the Panemar.
Work, you lumpers, work!
No China trade or a guidin’ star.
Watch them lumpers work!
It must be great in a trade-wind’s teeth,
With lines a-singin’, real sea beneath.
An’ a chance of berthin’ in Hull or Leith.
’Ow them lumpers work!
But I’m gettin’ old, me plates is thin.
Yes, we’ll give ’em coal,
It won’t be long ’fore they turn me in.
Always wantin’ coal!
I’ve fed fast yachts an’ coasters slow,
An’ battleships, if yer want ter know,
But they’ll soon burn oil, so I want ter go
Now while they’re usin’ coal.

The Lamp.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MORALISTS insist that no man is so
fallen from grace that a spark of the
Divine may not be found within him.
Such evidence of creative benevolence was
to be found in the ragged breast of Boree
Joe, though it was manifest to very few.
Among the few was McKay, of the Border
Police, whose patrol took in several hun-
dred square miles of Queensland Outback.
McKay had a secret pity for Boree Joe,
although his manner towards the sullen,
brooding horse-breaker was carefully regu-
lated by official reserve. A grave, keen
soul was McKay, whose lank body and
brown face were known and respected to
the uttermost parts of his domain. He
talked seldom, but his rare smile warmed
the hearts of not a few. If stern lie was
incomparably just. He used both his wits
and his conscience. When McKay handled
a case he did it intelligently. He went into
the psychology of the thing as nearly as he
could. He had a way of dispensing his own
justice. No man went through the courts
if Angus McKay could avoid it. And since
an out-back trooper is of necessity thrown
almost wholly upon his own resources,
McKay mostly managed to run his district
the way it suited him. It was a far cry to
headquarters, and he didn’t bother authority
without grave reason.
Boree Joe was what is termed a “char-
acter.” Of this individual there are several
species, ranging from the comparatively
harmless, nimble-tongued, work-shy waster
to the beetle-browed exponent of stark mur-
der. Boree Joe lay somewhere between the
extremes. He was a man of moods, with
a bias in favor of unprintable language
and summary violence. But he was a good
horse-breaker in a land where every man
is that way inclined by nature, and his
morose presence was tolerated accordingly.
No one inquired into Boree Joe’s past.
He broke his colt and passed on to the next
yards. If he had a friend that friend was
not apparent to the back country. He rode
alone in the eye of his fellows, a sour, surly
misanthrope that men shunned and women
were glad to see the last of. His potentiali-
ties for crime of a startling
order were recognised by most.
Yet, save that it was Boree
Joe who set the ball rolling and
provided the motif of the ensu-
ing drama, he does not enter
into this story at all. He re-
mains off-stage; yet none the
less a definitely menacing and
pathetic presence. Unseen and
unheard by the three actors in
the, piece, his hand yet lay
heavily on them all; each to a
varying degree.
The play began when Boree
Joe, having laid waste by fire
the sheds and stacks and pas-
tures of a squattage whose man-
ager had ordered him off the
property, following an assault
by fist and tongue on the part
of the breaker, vanished like
smoke into thin air. Arson
being reckoned in the calendar of
backblock crime as about equal
to murder, no effort was spared
by trooper McKay, at the head
of a hastily gathered posse, to
bring the offender to book.
For a whole fortnight the tropic sun
looked down upon as exhausting and ex-
haustive yet ineffectual man-hunt as the
heart of pessimist could desire. Failure, in-
deed, was foredoomed, for the hills were wild
and the valleys deep, and Boree Joe was a
busliman born. McKay, grave and silent as
ever, disbanded his army and retired to
think the entire situation out afresh.
Here, if ever, was food for the psychologist.
If Angus McKay were in Boree Joe’s place
what would he do? How would he get his
food? How cover the tracks of his horse,
supposing he remained in the locality? How
escape the hue and cry broadcasted from
every police post along the border?
It took McKay two days’ hard thinking,
with his chin on his chest, before he thought
he knew the answer to some, at least, of
these questions. On the morning of the
third day, with a week’s rations in his pack
and his gear in order, he rode.nort'i for 50
miles. Dusk found him making camp by
a waterhole under a spur of the foothills.
It was a region given over primarily to
mulga and mosquitoes, and McKay made
a wry face at the wall of darkness hemming
him in with tropic swiftness. A deep silence
hung over the gullies and ridges save for
the occasional harsh screams of a bedding
bird and the zip of circling bats’ wings. Not
a breath of air stirred. To all seeming the
dour trooper was as far removed from human
intercourse as though he were afloat in mid
ocean, instead of upon the misty exhalations
of a world sinking to its sleep. Night, no
less than day, yields her mirage; and Mc-
Kay, peering into the pulsing twilight, found
time to marvel at the dis-
tortions silhouetted
against a sapphire sky-
line.
His isolation, however,
was only apparent. He
knew that beyond the
shoulder of hill, not a
quarter of a mile distant,
a woman and a crippled
boy asked of the hot stars
what less life might dare
to offer. The woman was
Mary Brady, spinster in
the eyes of Church and
State. The boy was her
son—a wild thing doomed
by an outraged God of
Grundy to a cankering
hip-joint, and, by the gall
in his sire’s veins, to the
pariahship of a deserted
mother. Charity found
no kinder remission of
sin than the offer of this
pitiful existence on a
corner of a cattle-run.
Mary Brady cooked for
the mustering station -
hands twice a year. Be-
tween whiles she tended
the four mills and troughs
above the bores that
served as oases to the
thirsting stock. They and
the dwarfed bastard with
the dragging leg were her
sole excuse for exist-
ence.
Hidden by a wilderness
more pitiful than man,
their presence was sus-
pected by but few. It was
from Boree Joe that Me-
Kay had learned of Mary Brady and “the poor
little devil of a young ’un.” McKay had
been surprised to discover a streak of gruff
tenderness in the horse-breaker, who, in the
process of consigning Mary Brady’s man
to the depths of an unmentionable hell for
a cowardly adjectival cow, made no secret
of his liking for little Terry Brady. It
was clear from what he said that he visited
the woman and boy fairly often ; but beyond
this he refused to be drawn. Indeed, he
appeared almost immediately to regret even
the little he had said. Some strange chord
in the man’s warped soul had sung at this
tragic discovery, and whatever of good he
knew had gone out to the woman and boy.
The acquaintance presumably dated back
for some time; for McKay, for other reasons
checking Boree’s account with the store-
keeper, had come upon such incongruous
items as barley-sugar, cheap toys and still
cheaper scent and face-powder. On finding
the last items McKay had stared a little
hard through the open doorway at the
purple shadows of the everlasting hills.
“God! Face powder and scent... .a woman
like that in a hell of a place like that!”
For a little time the sheer pathos of the thing
had held him rigid.
In the stress of work McKay had forgotten
the whole incident. Only after his posse’s
unavailing hunt for Boree Joe did the recol-
lection of Mary Brady come. To be sure!
Where else would Boree make but to such
certain haven as the bark humpy of the
woman and boy, scarcely more miserable now
than Boree himself! There would be food
in plenty, for at that season of the year
supplies went to the out-stations in readiness
for the summer muster. The trooper slapped
DANGER SIGNALS.
MARY : “Mine tinkit I’ll have to do it, Missus.”
THE MISSUS : “Do what, Mary?”
MARY : “Git my ’air thingled, or mine lose’m Jacky.”
his thigh with an iron hand. He would go
and get Boree from the Bradys’ hut. He
knew instinctively that his man was there
or thereabouts. The end of the hunt was in
sight.
Rather more obscured, however, than
McKay would have conceded at the beginning
of his trip. On the night of his arrival in
the foothills he carefully circled the hut,
looking for tracks in the peaty soil. He
found plenty, all converging upon the hut
from a ravine to the north. The discovery
both pleased and irked McKay, for it told
him that, although the tracks were Boree’s
(of this he could be reasonably sure, at
least), the man was exhibiting unexpected
caution. Boree Joe was not to be caught
napping. Apparently he visited his friends
briefly only, put up tucker for a day or so,
and retired to his fastness, wherever it was.
He did not sleep at the hut. The number
and freshness of the tracks proved that.
McKay grinned sourly and set himself to
watch the ravine face. He was still watch-
ing when day broke. Either Boree Joe had
made the trip earlier or it was not his night
to come.
McKay returned to camp, watered his
horse and staked it in a fresh grass patch,
fed sparingly, and rolled sleepily in his one
blanket. Boree would not venture the trip
by daylight. McKay had nothing to do but
catch up with his dreams. He was particu-
larly anxious to hide his presence from Mary
Brady. If Boree Joe were warned he would
never be caught. Tracking on those hot,
stony ridges was impossible. He must be
coaxed into the net. He must not be allowed
even to suspect that McKay was waiting
for him.
COMING TO AN UNDERSTANDING.
JACK: “ You’ve got to he above suspicion—like C[?]sar’s wife.”
JILL: “I say, old thing, aren’t you putting me on rather a high pedestal?—Cassar was Cusar, you know.”
McKay came awake shortly after noon to
a curious conviction that someone or some-
thing was observing him. Boree —if it were
Boree—was capable of almost anything, and
McKay, under the subterfuge of stretching,
reached for his service revolver before sit-
ting up with an innocent yawn. At. first
nothing met his gaze but the still, wilting
wall of bush. Then he became aware of
two bright, animal eyes staring out from
a tangle of fern. McKay, still yawning, got
to his feet. Whatever this was that con-
fronted him, he meant to flush it.
But at the first forward step the ferns
shook to a startled escape. Revolver in
hand, McKay had a fleeting glimpse of a
slight form writhing and twisting itself into
obscurity a shock-haired, indescribably
tattered figure that trailed one leg with
incredible speed, to vanish with the sudden-
ness of a holing rabbit.
McKay, surprised from his usual reserve,
swore aloud. “Damnation —it’s the Brady
kid! He might be a wallaby by the pace of
him. Lucky I didn’t shoot.”
Concealment was a thing of the past.
McKay could picture the dynamic entry of
the hut that was home to this wild, crippled
image of the Infinite, conveying to a Boeotian
mother the terror of discovery; the sullen
reconnaissance from the warped slit that
did duty for a window; the mutterings and
plottings that would father denials to come.
He saw Mary Brady as a flat-bosomed, toil-
ridden slattern.
Then, oddly, he remembered the scent and
face powder, and fell to wondering as he
made ready for his next move in the game.
There was nothing for it but to see how the
land lay at the Bradys’ hut. It might be
that the sight of his service uniform would
simplify matters. Mary Brady-—— McKay’s
lips formed the name doubtfully. Somehow
the Irish lilt of it warned his preconceived
ideas. Boree Joe’s liarborer might prove
something of a surprise.
McKay was glad he had made this reser-
vation when he confronted the woman an
hour later. Mary Brady was plain to the
eye, but it was the plainness that knows a
beauty of its own. She was undersized and
pale, bearing full evidence —feature by fea-
ture —of the story that was hers. But her
neatness was undeniable, and her smile was
sheer pathos. From their framing of smooth
dark hair her faded eyes looked passively
into McKay’s own.
A little awkwardly the trooper accepted
a quiet invitation to enter. His plans for
the night were already worked out. Under
one pretext or another he meant to hold
under that roof until the next dawn the
three souls cast for the drama in which
Boree Joe played the part of lead. McKay
believed that Boree would visit the place be-
fore midnight, provided no warning reached
him. He was tolerably certain that neither
woman nor boy had so far found opportunity
to communicate with Boree. The nearest
safe cover was some miles away on a crest
of the hills. Given time his man would walk
directly into the trap. There was no escape.
As the hot daylight slowly waned McKay
read confirmation of this in Mary Brady’s
face. Their talk had been desultory and
noncommittal. McKay gave out that he
was there to meet the teams, expected the
next day or the day after that. A matter
of dog licenses. He knew that he was en-
tirely disbelieved, but that did not matter.
He had to say something, and one lie was as
good as another. Whenever he could he
avoided the growing torment in the woman’s
eyes. He felt that the situation was proving
too much for her.
And yet, in a sense, defeat seemed far
from her yet. A blankness had crept into
Mary Brady’s voice and expression. Once
or twice he caught her looking at him side-
ways, with a queer, deliberate biting of the
thin lips. She had a habit of lifting a hand
half-way. to her starved bosom, then letting
it fall again listlessly. McKay had a notion
that she was continually upon the point of
saying something—something _ vital. But
the moments passed and nothing came.
It grew dark presently, and Mary Brady
lit a large tin oil-lamp that stood on a case
by the open frame of the one window. Be-
yond it McKay had an impression of tim-
bered hill-ridges pressed flat upon a fading
horizon of turquoise and gold. The sky was
a saucer of glowing crystal inverted upon a
bowl of deep shadow. Creation was in flux.
The trooper, sitting cornerwise by the door,
silently watched the woman and boy making
their supper. He had refused to share the
meal on the plea that it was too hot to eat.
Presently, he lied, he must be making back
to his camp. But the night was young, and
he had no doubt he could tell them still more
of the outside world while waiting for the
teams, which he would not despair of for
some hours yet. McKay hated this game of
make-believe, hated the way the woman
winced each time he announced his intention
:o remain a little longer on the off-chance.
He was glad of a diversion caused by an
enormous beetle which plunged into the
chimney of the lamp with the suicidal en-
thusiasm of its kind. He fished the smoking
remains from the flaring wick and removed
the lamp to the plank mantel above the
hearth. It would be freer there from the
attentions of the insect world, he decided.
Back in the seat hidden from without by
the half-open door, McKay surprised a dull
red flush mounting the woman’s face. The
hands that disrobed the boy in readiness for
the bag-quilted bed in the opposite corner
were trembling. They were hands crabbed
and roughened with incredible toil, but of a
tenderness that was almost immaculate.
They flowed about the broken body of the
child like some soothing unguent. When they
touched the maimed hip they seemed to rest
there a moment, quivering. McKay had
an extraordinary idea that the hands were
crying.
He cleared his throat roughly and looked
at the boy, now hunched in the blankets.
The pinched face was in shadow, but a pair
of bright eyes met his unwinkingly.
“That kid ought to see a doctor,” said
McKay, voicing the thought unconsciously.
“It’s been my prayer ever since he took
ill,” said Mary Brady simply. She seemed
to contain both McKay and the child in one
slow, passionate look. “O God! If he
could have his chance!”
She turned hurriedly and, taking the tin
lamp, as though scarcely knowing what she
did, set it once more before the window.
There was nothing in the action to startle
McKay, yet somehow he was disturbed. Per-
haps it was the now jagged outline of the
range, seen anew beyond the tiny illumination
by some curious trick of atmospherics, that
stirred his caution. For the first time it
occurred to him that the light must be
visible from the hill above the ravine.
He rose deliberately and returned the lamp
to the mantel, conscious of a sudden distaste
as he heard the breath catch in Mary Brady’s
throat. For some seconds they regarded
each other. Then McKay once more dropped
into his seat and fumbled for his pipe. He
thought he knew at last; but the knowing
brought him no pleasure. There was some-
thing very like hatred in the unwavering
stare from the bed in the corner.
All at once Mary Brady did a queer
thing. She took a paper from the bosom of
her dress and thrust it into McKay’s hand.
It was a printed list of winning numbers in
a well-known “consultation.” The number
opposite the premier prize was scored faintly
in pencil.
“Well?” asked McKay, not understanding.
Mary Brady began the motion of lifting
her hand to her breast. But this time the
hand did not falter. It came flatly against
the thin dress, the fingers spatulate and
clinging. She began to speak in a high,
nervous voice.
“Yes; that’s it. Do you believe in a God?
I didn’t, until that came. At least, now I
ain’t so sure. God or the Devil, it's there
in your hand —the winning number.”
McKay’s pulse leapt.
“You don’t mean you hold the ticket m
that sweep?” . „ , r _ .
“A friend of mine’s got it.” Mary Brady
made a half movement in the direction of
the darkened window. “He don’t know it yet.
He was —I mean he ain’t home yet. It —it was
to have been —I mean for us all —a new life!”
McKay said nothing. He sat waiting.
“He ain’t a good man. you’d say,” the
shaking voice continued, after an interval of
choking silence. “The boy and me, we know
better’ll that. In a place like this I don’t
know what we’d have done without him.
All kinds of things—toys—he and the boy
fair worship each other. He was going to
fix the boy’s leg some day—give the kid a


chance to be like other boys. It was a joke
we had—and yet it wasn’t a joke, lie meant
it. He used to—to”
“Go on,” said McKay gently.
She seemed to be listening. The skin of
her face was tightened, an ivory parchment
stretched over sharp bones. When he touched
her arm she looked at him vacantly.
“What then? Did you think someone was
coming? It’s all quite quiet. This friend
of yours—l'm interested.”
“He was going to take him away to a
doctor,” she said in a dull agony. "lie—l
said we; I was willing and glad to marry
him. We’d stand to the boy together, if the
luck let us. It couldn’t ever happen, of
course; we knew that. And it has happened,
It’s there now, in your hand—the boy’s
chance.”
“Yes?” said McKay.
She burst out at him like a mad woman.
“Damn you, damn yon ! Why do you tor-
ment me? Do your dirty work !”
“Steady.” said McKay. “Steady. I’m not

“Mine’s worse. She won’t even give me credit for the clothes.”

Not yet. Go on. Is that all the story?”

him promise me, for Terry’s sake. He ain’t
never told me a lie yet. He’s got it in him to
be good. We’ve none of us had a chance.”
She broke off, her face a mask of terror,
“O God! What was that?”
McKay, biting his lips, caught the faint
echo of running hoofs. The sound played
up and down the strings of the night in a

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SANDHAM was whistling blithely an air
from a ten-year-old musical comedy as
he tossed clothing, boots and odds and
ends into a yawning swag-bag. Heigho for
Sydney and the bright lights! Six months’
leave was not hard to take! From the
office came the steady clicking of a type-
writer, and Sandham grinned as he recog-
nised the sure touch of practised fingers.
Wilson, his successor, seemed a decent sort.
A trifle too natty as to dress, perhaps, and
inclined to attach too much importance to
filing systems, correspondence records and
other non-essentials; but three years in a
Port Moresby office would upset any nan’s
sense of proportion. Fortunately, the dis-
trict was in good shape. The coastal tribes
were quiet and well-behaved; there had been
no serious crime for months. Even the
Agiagi people seemed to have abandoned their
age-old custom of taking heads when the
crops failed. He must warn Wilson to keep
a tight rein on the Agiagi people. They
were good fellows, really, once one “saveed”
their point of view, and with ex-Sergeant
Omakana as village constable, and a district
magistrate up to his job, they should
A smothered exclamation from the office
interrupted his reverie.
“I say, Sandham” —there was a note of
petulance in the speaker’s voice “your
hand must be like a bull’s foot. This
machine’s absolutely ruined!”
Sandham lashed the swag-bag expertly,
tossed it to a waiting constable and joined
the other in the office. Wilson was seated
at the table exploring the interior of a
battered typewriter. His fingers and the
cuffs of his immaculate drill coat were
stained purple, spots of oil showed on the
knees of his trousers, his hair was rumpled,
and beads of perspiration trickled down his
nose. Sandham perched himself on a corner
of the table, heedless of Wilson’s protest,
as a stack of neatly-arranged dockets fell
to the floor.
“Scrap the darned thing, Wilson,” he
suggested, “and order a new machine. The
launch will be at the landing in a few
minutes, and I’ll be off. Is there anythiug
you’re not sure about? The district gener-
ally, or the Agiagi patrol? If I can”
“Bother the Agiagi patrol! It would be
more to the point if you would explain
your filing system. Really, old chap, the
station records are in an appalling muddle.”
Sandham laughed. “Office stuff!” he
jeered airily. “All right in Moresby, where
a misplaced comma makes strong men shriek,
but—anyhow. I wish you luck, old man.
It’s a good district, and there are no ’lega-
cies’ for you to clean up. The detachment
is in good nick, and you’ll find Sergeant
Kamu a first-class non-com.”
It was obvious that Wilson was not listen-
ing very intently. His eyes wandered about
the office, taking in the shabby, deal-topped
table, the dusty pigeon-holes, and the accu-
mulation of papers littering the floor,
"Omakana, the Agiagi Y.G. [village con-
stable], is by way of being a pal of mine,”
went on Sandham, frowning slightly; “and
Kamu”
“Oh, Kamu !” interrupted Wilson. "He’s
the sergeant, is he not? Can he read and
write?”
Sandham choked. "Eh? Good God, no!
But lie’s a good bloke to lean upon when
you’re in a hole.”
lie studied the other thoughtfully, made
as if to speak again, then checked himself,
From the landing came the sputter of an
oil-launch. A uniformed native thrust his
head through the open window. “All ready,
sail,” he announced.
“Righto, Sergeant!” answered Sandhain.
“By the way, Sergeant, can you read and
write ?”
“No, sail,” answered Ivamu, blinking
stolidly. “I no savee, sail.”
“Too right, you don’t!” agreed Sandhain
fervently. “Good-bye, Wilson ! Don’t teach
the old bird any Port Moresby parlor
tricks.” And so tuey parted.
* * * *
Wilson’s heart glowed within him. In
Moresby he was a very “small fella Gava-
mani” indeed. Here the attitude of the
police was subtly flattering.' They waylaid
him in the station grounds, stiffened their
stocky bodies at his approach, and saluted
him with devastating ceremony. And Wil-
son liked it. He did not realise that the
hard-bitten, grizzled old warrior who wore
three stripes on the sleeve of his red-braided
jumper was studying him, analysing him,
and taking his measure for all time; nor that
the rank and tile were observing closely, in
a manner characteristically Papuan, how
the new magistrate reacted to their stock-in-
trade of parade-ground tricks. He threw
himself into the task of reorganising the
office with wholehearted enthusiasm.
Strange that a man of Saudham’s standing
in the service should be so ignorant of
the elementary principles of office routine!
Why, there were native clerks at head-
quarters—sleek, suave gentlemen from Ilanu-
abada who wore trousers and spoke mission-
school English who could give Sandham
points! Even the furniture was shockingly
dilapidated. The table, its legs ravaged by
termites, its top stained with ink and scored
with the initials of former district officers,
was an offence to the eye. “J.H.” stood
for Jack Hicks, who had left his bones
somewhere on the upper reaches of the Fly;
“D. 8.” was Bailey, now a person of some
tonnage in official circles at headquarters.
One and all the crudely-formed letters stood
for men who had made Papuan history, but
to Wilson they typified a spirit of vandalism
excusable perhaps in schoolboys, but hardly
befitting the dignity of senior magistrates.
He determined to include a supply of
American cloth in his next requisitions.
One day he was distributing new uniforms
to the police when he came across two or
three blue-serge sulus similar to the police
issue, save that they lacked the distinctive
red braid.
“Clothes b’long village p’licemen, tau-
bada,” explained Sergeant Kamu.
Wilson nodded. Then he had an inspira-
tion.
“Take them ’long office, Sergeant. They
make good cover for my table.”
Kamu’s eyes widened in surprise. “But,
taubada,” he remonstrated, “no more stop.
S’pose village p’licemen want new”
“Take them to the office !” snapped Wil-
son. “When I give you an order, hop to it!
Savee ?”
So Wilson acquired a cover for his table;
but there were murmurs in the barracks that
night.
Some weeks later, as Wilson was immersed
in the compilation of a card-index. Kamu
ushered in a dignified old mountain man,
wearing a tattered uniform and displaying
ostentatiously a pair of rusty handcuffs.
“This man is Omakana, taubada,” an-
nounced the sergeant.
“Omakana?” queried Wilson. “Who’s
Omakana, and what does he want?”
Omakana, though not understanding the
words, sensed the tone of indifference in the
magistrate’s voice, and his expectant grin
faded.
“He village p’liceman b’long Agiagi.” ex-
plained Kamu patiently. “He good friend
b’long Mis’ Sanidami, so he come see you.
He friend for you, too. sah.”
“Oh, all right!” grunted Wilson. “Give
him some kaikai and a smoke. I’m busy.”
The two natives exchanged bewildered
glances. Kamu gave a deferential cough.
“He want new uniform, taubada,” he said.
Wilson dropped his pen with a sigh.
“Really. Sergeant.” he grumbled, “you’re
most exasperating. You savee that we’ve
used the uniforms for —er —other purposes.
Why” His eye lighted on a bolt of blue
dungaree, sent from headquarters for the
equipment of laborers recruited for the
Moresby road gangs. lie tore off a couple
of yards and tossed the stuff' at Omakana’s
feet. “That will do you for a while,’’ he said.
“Now, clear out, and let me get on with
my work.’’
Omakana picked up the material, examined
it curiously, then, with a gesture of con-
tempt, cast it from him. He drew himself
up and saluted.
“Taubada." lie said in Motuan, “for the
span of a man’s life I have served the Gava-
mani as a ribbon-policeman [armed con-
stable!. and now, in my old age. 1 am the
village policeman at Agiagi. Why is this
shame put upon me? If I return to my
people wearing the clothes of a gau karaia
fauna | laborer j the young men will spit at
me, the women will laugh, and the children
win mock me, saying. ‘Behold! Omakana the
policeman is no longer a Gavamani man, but
is become a breaker of stones and a splitter
of eocoanuts!’ Much trouble will”
“Good Lord. Sergeant!” broke in Wilson.
“What's the old goat bleating about now?”
Kaniu shrugged his shoulders helplessly.
The situation was getting beyond him. The
new magistrate was ignorant of Motuan. and
how could a man think in English? “Tau-
bada." he said at last, groping for words,
"lie say—he say—this clothes, he no —•
good !”
Wilson flushed angrily. “You—you”
lie spluttered. “Get out. the pair of you!
Quick and lively, before I boot you out!”
Kamu’s dusky face became a mask. lie
opened his lips to speak, then clicked his
heels together and saluted, and, motioning
to Omakana, left the room in silence. Wil-
son went back to his card index.
The months passed very pleasantly for
Wilson. He filled the gaol with tax-evaders’
and other petty offenders. He planted the
station gardens with crotons and flowering
shrubs, and when the police asked for taro
he gave them rice. In the office he evolved
order out of chaos. Brand-new presses held
neatly filed and tabulated dockets, indexed
and cross-indexed so that even a man of
Sandham’s temperament could hardly go
astray. Occasionally rumors filtered through
to the coast that all was not well at Agiagi.
There were ugly tales of time-expired
laborers failing to reach their homes on the
other side of the range, and still more dis-
quieting stories of raids on neighboring vil-
lages and the taking of heads. The reports
became so persistent that Wilson felt he
could no longer afford to ignore them. He
sent in a patrol under the command of a
lviwai corporal. To Kamu’s almost tearful
request to be allowed to take charge, he re-
turned a blunt refusal. The police returned
after a week’s absence, and reported all well
at Agiagi. Wilson went back to his files.
Then the bubble burst. One morning as
Wilson was instructing a recruit in the art
of presenting arms, an orderly announced
that Sandham had returned to the station.
Wilson frowned perplexedly.
“Sandham!” he muttered. “But he isn’t
due back for months!” He was conscious
of a feeling of vague uneasiness. Such devo-
tion to duty was, to say the least, unusual.
Ho made his way rapidly to the office. After
all, lie would not be sorry to return to head-
quarters.
Sandham greeted him warmly. “Back
again, old man,” he said. “No, I didn’t go
broke,” he went on, in answer to Wilson’s un-
spoken question. “Ordered back by radio,
worse luck!”
He turned to greet Sergeant Kamu, but
his welcoming smile turned to a frown of
displeasure. “Good Lord, Sergeant!” he
exclaimed severely. “Why, man, you’re fat!*’
If Kamu could have blushed he would
have done so. He fumbled with Jiis bayonet,
wiggled his bare toes, and manifested every
symptom of acute discomfort.
“And the police!” continued Sandham.
THE EDUCATED PIG.
MADAME PIG: “That heats you, Mrs. Co[?]tontail — addition!”
MISTRESS COTTONTAIL: “ Pooh —I don’t bother with anything below multiplication!”
“My hat! They look like cook-boys!” The
men slunk back to the barracks, exchanging
meaning glances.
Sandham joined Wilson in the office.
“I suppose you wish to take over imme-
diately.” said Wilson. “So I’ll explain the
new filing system. It’s” ——
“Hold on, old man,” broke in Sandham.
“What the deuce is the trouble here?”
“Trouble? There’s no trouble here, Sand-
ham. Everything is going fine.”
Sandham’s eyes reflected his relief. “I'm
glad to hear it, Wilson,” he exclaimed.
“They seem a bit rattled at headquarters on
account of vague rumors floating around
about massacres at Agiagi.”
An expression of genuine surprise came
into Wilson’s eyes. Then he laughed—a
smooth, irritating laugh. “Oh, that!” he
said pettishly. “Nigger yarns, Sandham!
Just lying reports spread by the coastal
people "and nothing more. Now, all inward
letters”
“.Tust a shake, old man, until I get this
straight.” Sandham glanced around the
office. “There’s no doubt you’ve done won-
ders here, and all that, but what, exactly, did
you discover at Agiagi?”
Wilson made a clicking noise with his
tongue, expressive of impatience. “Nothing
at all, Sandham. I’ll send for Corporal Bogi
and he’ll give you the strength of things.”
Sandham whistled. “Then—er—you didn't
— er —make a personal investigation?”
“Certainly not! It was not convenient
for me to leave the station. Besides, I was
in the middle of my monthly reports.”
“Great Scott!” There was a moment of
tense silence. Then Sandham got to his
feet. “I’ll take charge now, Wilson,” he
said, and his voice held a quality of grimness
which to Wilson was vaguely disquieting.
“Better parade Bogi for dismissal. You’ll
find that lie never went beyond the first rest-
house. Detail Kamu and two men to round
up twenty carriers for daylight to-morrow.
And, Wilson, you may —er —return to Mores-
by in the launch.”
“But, I say, Sandham,” expostulated Wil-
son. “I assure you that”
Sandham wheeled upon him suddenly, his
eyes blazing. “Do as I say!” he snapped;
then, in an altered voice: “Don’t you under-
stand, Wilson, that you can’t run an out-
station with a blasted typewriter?”
* * * *
The following night Sandham and his de-
tachment camped under the stars, and the
next night, and the next. Then they came
to Agiagi. As they neared the village there
came to their ears a sinister, menacing
sound ; steadily, relentlessly, seeming to gain
momentum with every beat—the throb of
the tribal drums. Far off loomed the rugged
outlines of the Main Range, and from a sky
jewelled by a myriad stars the moon poured
down serenely, bathing the world in a silver
light. Sandham smiled sardonically. It was
hard to associate such a scene of infinite
peace and beauty with the primitive lusts
of men. Suddenly the drums ceased. There
arose a yell of rage from the village, and a
flight of arrows hurtled through the air.
The police lay prone, uttering little whim-
pering sounds like dogs straining at the
leash.
Sergeant Kamu rose to his feet. “O
fools!” he bellowed. “This is not the ‘small
Gavamani!’ Here is Sanidami come to
exact”
Another shower of arrows cut him short.
Sandham gave the anxiously-awaited signal.
The police carbines spoke; the outlying huts
went up in sheets of flame, and in half an
hour there was peace at Agiagi.
They entered the village in the early flush
of dawn. By twos and threes the villagers
drifted in, badly frightened but chastened,
and lounged about sullenly awaiting the
white man’s pleasure.
“Let Omakana be brought,” ordered Sand-
ham.
A spindle-shanked old man of villainous
aspect raised a thin, cackling laugh. “Oma-
kana— helie—Omakana is dead, white man,”
he jeered.
Sergeant Ivamu raised his carbine threat-
eningly, and the ancient, suddenly sobered,
shuffled forward.
“Speak, old one,” snapped Sandham.
The old man swallowed hard, casting
appealing glances at his assembled friends.
“Taubada,” he began, “when Omakana, the
policeman, came back from the saltwater with-
out his clothes, we knew that he had lost
favor with the Gavamani, and we no longer
heard his voice.” There came a murmur of
assent from the assembled villagers. “We
speared him, white man, and took his head”
—an expression of cold ferocity flickered
into his eyes, and was gone—“and the old
days came back to the mountains!”
Somebody in the crowd cast a parcel
wrapped in tapa-cloth at Sandham’s feet.
Kamu unrolled it, disclosing a length of
faded blue dungaree and a short strip of
Turkey-red twill, bought from some trader’s
store. The two materials together made a
pitiful travesty of a policeman’s uniform.
“Behold the clothes of Omakana!” said
the ancient villager.
“Good God!” said Sandham. He turned
to Sergeant Kamu, his face working
strangely. “Omakana was my friend, Ser-
geant,” he whispered.
“And mine also,” said Kamu gently.
“I feel that we’ve murdered him, Ser-
geant.”
“Not you, taubada,” replied Kamu.
Sandham turned on his heel. “The fool!”
he grated savagely in English. “The poor,
blind, pitiful, fool!”
* * * *
In a comfortable office at headquarters,
where the drone of an electric fan drowns
the hum of mosquitoes, there is a capable
filing-clerk, very natty as to dress and very
punctilious in returning the salutes of well-
fed. flat-footed orderlies. From Mamba
Beach to the Fly, wherever men give New
Guinea of their best for the joy of a job
well done, he is known as “Dungaree Wil-
son.” But Wilson is quite happy. The
gibe leaves him cold. He fancies that it is
a subtle though envious tribute to his taste
in socks and the cut of his white-drill pants.

Coolabah.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SOMEONE sent to me to-day
Faded leaves of greenish grey,
Leaves without a written word,
And my memory like a bird
Flew toward the tracks that run
Through the flats to Barringun.
Coolabah ! With scanty shade
Where the grey goannas played,
Where the frontage weaners stood
In their listless noonday mood
With the grass-seed in their eyes,
Twitching ears against the flies.
Coolabah ! And, winding through,
Patient bullocks two by two,
Lolling tongues and slavering lips,
Swaying, crouching to the whips;
Towering wool-bales and, behind,
Dust clouds rolling white and blind.
Coolabah ! Two thousand head
Down the frontage strung and spread;
Clashing horns and drumming feet,
Reds and roans that :u.x and meet ;
Lean, brown stockmen singing gaily:
“Let ’em spread! We’re on Belalie !”
Coolabah ! My thoughts go back
To your stems that line the track!
Fain I’d lie but once again
Where at noon‘l’ve often lain,
Staring at the sunbeam tliiex • s
Breaking through your pointed leaves.
Coolabah! My thanks, old friend,
For this faded gift you send!
All my flowers I’ll cast aside 1 .
These shall have the place of pride;
I shall watch tlicir wonder daily,
Riding back through old Belalie.

A Little Less than Kin.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
NOW that it had come to a matter of
clearing out finally, Harkwell began
to be troubled about Maudie. During
the whole time she had been with him (and
that was over four years) she had never
assumed in liis mind the importance of a
problem. She herself, he reflected, as he sat
on his bed in one of those pauses of tempo-
rary frustration that are part of the process
of packing up—she herself would be all
right. By that he merely meant that she
would not be seriously disturbed at losing
him. When he had told her of his intention,
she had only looked at him queerly—a little
sadly, perhaps. He had never had any
doubt but that she had been (as the phrase
goes) faithful to him; but he knew that,
when he had gone, she would take up with
George, the half-caste, who hung round her
so much. A curious momentary shade of
regret crossed his mind. This, as lie im-
mediately perceived, was colored with a
faint tint of jealousy, which was utterly
absurd, and unreasonable besides —for was
he not abandoning the girl? Certainly she
was better than most of the half-castes,
in temperament as well as in training, not
to mention looks, which were not unimport-
ant.
So his thoughts ran on ; and, having ap-
praised her, he reflected again, quite without
hypocrisy, that she would be all right. But
there was the child, when it was born—if
ever! Those words “if ever” arose as a
matter of course in an acute mind trained
by loneliness to exhaust all the possible con-
tingencies of ideas; but no sooner had they
arisen than they resolved themselves into
a sinister suggestion. This may have been
because he happened at the moment to be
staring at a holster from which, lying among
the litter at his feet, protruded the butt of
a revolver. Instantly his brain followed up
this new line of thought, concentrating upon
it with that fixity which also is a condition
of solitary living in remote places, and which
is the eventual tragedy of such exile.
Harkwell had always taken a serious view
of parentage, and what troubled him now
was the notion of a loose half-breed brat of
his running about the earth. The idea of
bringing up and educating such a child as
if it were white had never seriously occurred
to him. He had seen that tried. Here,
in the Northern Territory even, were ex-
amples of that. That simply meant develop-
ing a human being’s capacity for suffering
in circumstances of the most painful ostra-
cism. Besides, so many of them—most of
them, in fact—turned out to be an inherently
low type, and not a true type at that. He
had watched it oddly, here and there, in
Maudie. Take, for instance, that strain of
apathetic laziness in her character. She
could sit or lie about for hours doing nothing,
not like a white person, watching things, or
consciously enjoying sensations of light,
shadow, warmth, coolness or color, but quite
blankly. That could be seen, apart from
asking her questions, by the lazy stare of her
great eyes, which at such times were as
vacant as an animal’s. Lately she had
taken to loafing about on the big flat rock
on the edge of the gorge overlooking the
valley, lying there like a lizard, lie had
tried to get at her states of mind, but, gener-
ally speaking, she had none. There were
other things, too —things that were some-
times little short of revolting.
He had no difficulty in imagining what
would become of her. She would take up
with George. George went casually from
place to place as the chance of a job offered
-—droving, with mailmen, off-siding for sur-
veyors or prospectors; anything. George
would take Maudie with him; the bushmen
would get to know her, as she was already
known to some of them. George, like most
of his kind, was not particular where the
getting of money or tucker was concerned,
and Maudie would end up—how? Hark-
well had seen girls like her at the Lake
Nash lock hospital, or periodically in and out
of the clinic at the Darwin compound. And
(this was what troubled him! all the time,
everywhere, this brat, this child of his. Rob-
ert H'arkwell’s, would be with her and grow
in evil. It was useless, too, to think of pro-
viding for her —for them —and placing them
definitely. Yes. it was undoubtedly a mess,
though inevitable in the retrospect, and he
did not hold himself to blame in the least.
Still, the question was
He stooped, still sitting, and took the re-
volver from the holster. It was loaded ready,
anyhow. The idea grew.
The bed on which Harkwell sat was so
placed that when he awoke of a morning he
could look across the valley to the lagoon,
with a glimpse of the little gap where the beach
served as a landing-place. The south-easterly
winds of the dry season had commenced, but
the country was still green from the rains,
and gleamed with the hard intensity of the
morning sunlight. Those dry winds, though
autumnal here in the north, always had for
Harkwell the strange, disturbing effect of
springtime in the south. The bright colors
outside now accentuated this effect. The
sky was bright blue. The deep green of the
trees on the shady side of the winding gorge
to the left had that cool suggestion of descend-
ing deptli which belongs to riverside hills.
To the right, the ledges dropped in irregular
broad terraces, overgrown to a height of live
or six feet with thick, pale green grass, the
seeded tops of which had ripened golden-
brown like wheat. Then came the clearing,
which sloped down to the lapping ripples on
the tiny beach, while, beyond, great water-
lilies with red flowers floated at the foot
of the pandanus palms. Further away still,
past the salt, marshy flats, stretched the
distant green of the open sea. All this was
seen through a vista fringed by the frayed
leaves of banana plants and overarched by
the long branches of poincianas which Hark-
well himself had planted for the sake of this
effect. Now, dreamily gazing out, in a mood
like a reverie of springtime, lie traversed the
circumstances that had brought him to the
place.
It began with his marriage and the divorce
that followed so quickly. He, a young
engineer, scarcely out of student days, was,
as lie cynically saw it now, hypnotised by
the bobbed hair and silk stockings of a
typist in the office where he was filling his
first job. When he had successfully cited the
manager of the firm as co-respondent, the un-
employment that followed led to the offer
of a position at the meatworks at Darwin.
SHE MISJUDGED HER PASTRY.
“ I gave you a piece of pic last week, and you've been sending your friends here ever
since.”
“No, pardon, lady—my enemies.”
He snapped at the chance of a life away
from all former associations, and, besides, the
rate of pay was lavish. Amid the hubbub
and extravagance around him he lived quietly
and saved during those years. When the
works closed down the fad took him to buy up
cheaply the estate of a man whose death
disclosed the fact that there was money to
be made out of shooting buffaloes. He went
down the coast a couple of hundred miles to
look at the place and stayed there. Now he was
going away worth between five and six
thousand pounds, little enough, he reflected,
for the general run of men, but it would do
him. He had learned to live simply and rely
upon himself for everything, and in that man-
ner he had determined to end his days—but
not here. It had taken a good deal of forti-
tude to stick it so long, and nothing but the
prospect of this independence had held him
to it. His definition of independence was
not confined to the means of living. He
had been taught by those solitary years,
what few learn ever, that it is folly to as-
cribe to particular circumstances the recur-
ring dissatisfaction with life that is inherent
in the nature of life itself. Certainly, the
coming of Maudie had made things better —
had. indeed, restored in him something of
the humanity that constant introspection had
cynically overlaid and nearly destroyed
altogether.
It happened in this way. The lagoon
led at the length of about half a mile to a
sheltered bay which Harkwell used as an
anchorage for the lugger in which, two or
three times a year, he took his hides up to
Darwin for shipment south and brought back
stores and mails. There w T as no traffic
overland, except on rare occasions when, as
at the present time. George was sent with a
plant to pick up a special mail at Burrundie
on the railway line some 300 miles away.
For Harkwell’s first trip or two in the lugger,
matters of navigation had to be left recklessly
to the native whom he had acquired with
the craft when he took over the property,
but he soon picked up enough knowledge to
sail it himself. After one such trip, while a
gang of blacks were unloading the lugger as
she lay canted high and dry on the mud
during low water of the spring tides, a
commotion and a shout brought him down to
them. They were gesticulating and jabbering
and one of them was pointing seaward.
“What name 7” he called to them as he
came.
One of them came running up the beach
towards him ; then the others followed.
"Boat out there, boss,” said one. "Little
feller canoe,” said another in amplification.
Harkwell, watching where they pointed,
fancied he could see a speck bobbing about
among the waves far out. lie strode down
to the lugger for his binoculars, and, steady-
ing himself against the mast, could see, sure
enough, a small dug-out being paddled, very,
very slowly, as with the infinite weariness
of exhaustion, towards the shore, by a figure
that appeared to be a woman.
A dinghy, which had been hauled up the
foreshore, was carried down and put afloat
by the excited natives, and Harkwell stepped
in and was soon rowed out to the canoe.
The occupant was a mere girl. As the
dinghy came alongside she suddenly stopped
paddling and, leaning forward, qnictly col-
lapsed. Harkwell hauled her out and the
dinghy was rowed ashore. She lay in the
wash of the boat with her head against his
knee, her eyes closed, her features com-
posed in a perfect immobility which could
have been mistaken for death but for the
feeble lift and occasional shudder of her
bosom beneath the garment she wore, a
one-piece affair, covering her from the neck
to below the knee. This gown, made of jute,
was bordered at the neck, sleeves and hem
with colored braid —a costume that made
clear the fact that she had come across
the strait from the mission station on the
island 50 miles away.
They carried her, still unconscious, along
the track that skirted the lagoon to Hark-
wcll’s bungalow and placed her on his bed.
He got out some brandy, and, holding her
in a sitting position, forced it between her
lips. It was an obvious act which he did
in a neutral sort of way, and his mind was
detached enough to notice the curious, almost
Oriental, delicacy of her features. Clearly
she was the product of the mingling of
Asiatic blood with aboriginal, and not of
the mixture of the white and aboriginal
races, for her skin had something of the
golden smoothness of a Chinese girl’s, as dis-
tinct from the smudgy color of most Aus-
tralian half-castes.
She automatically swallowed a little of the
liquor, and then a low moan escaped her
and she shivered. Harkwell brought one
of the cheap print dresses that he kept for
the natives and put it on her in place of
the sea-soaked garment she wore, and as he
did so he noticed the developed roundness
of her limbs, different from the spindle-
shanked thinness which characterises the
aboriginal women and many of their half-
caste progeny. It may have been her plight,
or the chastity of nakedness, or both, which
caused him to remain unstirred beyond a
matter-of-fact solicitude, and even this had
something whimsical about it, as if the
affair should not be taken quite seriously.
His recognition that he had no knowledge
of what treatment her condition required was
almost comical, but, as she shivered again
at intervals, he administered more brandy
and rolled her into a bundle with the blanket
round her.
Then suddenly she struggled out of this
and sat up staring wildly. “Oh, where —-
where am I?” she said in a frightened voice.
Harkwell was astounded to hear her speak
otherwise than in pidgin English, till he
remembered she was from the mission, where
the parson in charge had a fad for teaching
the natives there to speak correctly. Before
he could reply, she fell back sobbing weakly
with her head buried in the pillow. An over-
whelming wave of pity, as if the inhibited
emotions of years had broken through the
restraint which he had habitually imposed
on them, swept him to his Knees beside the
bed, petting and comforting her. He brought
her food and drink, and she told him her story.
It was simple enough. At the mission she
had been guilty of some slight rebellion.
Reproof followed, then actual castigation, so
she put some food and water in a dug-out
that happened to be handy and cast off with-
out any clear notion of where she was going
till the tides and currents brought her in
sight of the mainland. Perhaps in her mixed
ancestry was the blood of venturesome
Malays, those vikings of Asia who, centuries
ago, came in their praus to these very shores,
leaving behind them the seed of the great
tamarind trees which successfully stand for
cenotaphs in the places where they camped.
Hartwell was for sending her back to the
mission right off, but she made it clear that
she would not go. Truth to tell, he was
not reluctant to let her remain.
So lie settled down to what, in his own
mind, he sardonically called his second mar-
riage. He had no scruples about it. The
sort of life necessarily lived in such places is
possible to no man who does not accept the
course of events. Its danger (and, after
all, this is his own affair) is that he may
cease to desire anything better. Harkweil
applied himself to liis holding, though the
natives who had attached themselves to it
under his predecessor did most of the work.'
The buffalo-shooting was for them so much
exciting fun. For the rest, he soon acquired
enough knowledge to exercise the actual
management of the place. He increased its
meagre herd of cattle, and they bred, and
he made one or two lucky deals. So, pros-
pering quietly, he saw that he could sell
out in a few years, and with that prospect
in view his life went along almost happily.
lie became quite fond of Maudie, but
he realised that it was an affection not
essentially different from that excellent feel-
ing which a man has towards his dog. What
else, indeed (he sometimes asked himself),
was possible? There was, of course, the
difference that she was a woman, but there
was no correspondence between their minds
—never could be! She was pretty, and
sometimes even charming with a sort of
crude piquancy, but she brought the weari-
ness that comes of intimacy devoid of in-
telligence. Harkweil educed his own kind
of satirical consolation from the reflection
that this was probably an ordinary element
of the marital state.
The prospect of parentage did not come
till lie had, according to plan, begun to make
arrangements to give up the holding. This
was something entirely new, and it set him
thinking. Curious feelings arose in him —
strange pangs of solicitude for Maudie and
elusive hints of the touching wiles of child-
ren. He dismissed these feelings as worse
than futile. It was the only sensible thing
to do.
Then, on this northern autumnal morning,
so like the southern springtime, turning the
whole matter over in his mind again, it
became focussed to one outcome, as his eyes,
staring at the revolver in his hand, were
focussed to the means of effecting it. Those
years spent in the tropics suddenly became a
great bitterness —a grievance and a shame to
be wiped out, and not to be perpetuated in
the sequel of a despised progeny. He closed
his eyes, thinking. The law—there was no
law here. He had seen things... only nig-
gers, anyhow, and in an extremity it was
necessary to put fear of the white man into
them as a matter of self-preservation... She
was really nothing more than a nigger, too.
He put the revolver in his pocket, got
his hat, and went out into the hot, dry sun-
shine.
He knew where she would be: she was
always lounging about there lately, on the
big flat rock on the edge of the gorge over-
looking the overland track that wound
through the valley—either on the rock in the
sun or close by in the shade of the banyan
trees which with their exposed roots clutched
the brink of the precipice like balancing
eagles. Sheer below the rock was a narrow
chasm. Nobody knew what was at the bot-
tom. A shot from cover of the adjoining
jungle would be easy, and so would the rest.
George might return any moment now, and
it must be done before he came. The niggers
didn’t matter. The disappearance of Maudie
would not seem any more unaccountable than
her coming.
Harkweil hurried on in a strange exulta-
tion, a blazing blackness of the mind, like the
momentary blindness of his eyes when he had
come suddenly out of the house into the
hard, brilliant light. He was surprised to
find himself all at once at the end of the pad
through the grass, which was as high as his
head on either side.
Treading softly forward, he heard voices.
He peered out, starting when he saw Maudie
seated in the shade, with George, the half-
caste, reclining beside her. They were near
enough for Harkweil to hear what George
was saying, though Maudie’s voice came as
a murmur only.
With the swift and sudden pain of a spear
there flew into Harkwell’s brain the know-
ledge that months ago he had been super-
seded by a mongrel of a - half-caste. He
turned softly and fled, fled back to the
bungalow as if pursued. There he sat on
the edge of the bed again.
Ignominy overcame him with an effect
like nausea. He felt positively sick. He
held up his hands and looked at them; they
were trembling beyond control. “Time I
went south for a change,” he muttered auto-
maticallv, in a kind of stupor.
He lay down for a few moments with his
eyes closed. When he got up he felt quite
steady again, and in the normal clearness
of his mind the last half-hour or so seemed
infinite and incredible.
Presently he saw through the doorway
Maudie coming toward the house. As she
came in Harkweil read into her eyes a sort
of dreamy cunning which he imagined lie had
seen in them before without defining it. She
just glanced at the still unpacked litter on
the floor and was about to pass through
to the kitchen, but she turned in the door-
way at the sound of liarkwell’s voice uttering
her name. „ . ~
“Maudie, vou little devil, he said, witn
a sort of quizzical savageness in his tone.
“If i killed you just for fun. would they
bring in a verdict of tropical homicide with
a recommendation to mercy on the grounds
of neurasthenic misogamy ?”
The girl only laughed, as she always did
when he deliberately used big words to puzzle
and tease her. , ~. , n
“No sign of George yet?” asked Harkweil.
Maudie shook her head. . “No. she said
“he’s a long time away this time.”
Harkweil took the revolver out of his
pocket and stooped to put it back in the
holster. .... , . , , ,
“Maudie.” he said, “you’re just as bad as
a white woman.”

The Singing Waters.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I LEFT my love by the singing waters of
Mabillon,
In the hush of the mellow land ;
Silent she stood in the shade of the trembling
aspen-trees,
A yellow rose in her hand.
Gold were the leaves that fell in the tran-
quil autumn tide
And dropped through the windless air,
The fitful sun-shafts stole through the lat-
ticed boughs to light
The aureole of her hair.
Far over the world by the seas and the
spacious stranger-lands
I followed my restless dreams,
With ever a thought for the deep-branched
forests of Mabillon
And the voice of a hundred streams.
1 sought my love by the singing waters of
Mabillon
Deep-held in the murmuring glade,
Far over the slopes when larks were astir
and the scented briar
Casts its long morning shade.
I followed the untrod paths in the gloom
of the Haunted Wood,
I went by the utmost hill;
The night flowed over the land, the tremu-
lous dawn-star rose,
And found me following still.
But the sigh that came in the dust from
the shadowy forest ways
Was a little wind in the dark,
And the song that floated up from the
wakening meadow-land
The exultant lute of a lark.
She comes no more by the singing waters
of Mabillon
In the peace of the autumn-tide;
Her grave is wet ivith the dews and the
misty rains that fall
Far out on the bleak hillside.
Yet, when flakes of amber fall from the
fading aspen-trees
And drift through the windless air,
She waits again where the wavering sun-
shafts softly touch
The aureole of her hair.

LILLA CORMIIUILLE MCKAY.
The Piebald s Bell.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HARGREAVES cursed the truant
horse as he strode back along the
dew-marked tracks. Dawn splashed
a granite peak with crimson bars. The
Rocky Range was still a wall of gloom. A
colony of starlings had awakened and pro-
ceeded to arouse the whole bush side. Damp
grass surrendered its scent to the air.
Hargreaves was relieved that the rogue’s
tracks proved him still hobbled. Otherwise
he’d not stop until he had reached his birth-
place, the Coen, eighty miles south. This daily
tracking was irksome.
Presently the distant bell clanged jerkily.
The piebald was plunging southwards in be-
tween bites. Five miles from camp the
horse stood quietly, gazing over its shoulder
CONTAGION.
“'Orspital says I yot nooritis. A toff’s
disease. Mow'd a bloke git that?”
“Workin' fer 'em.”
" I don’t work!”
"I see yer doin’ it—mindin' a toff’s car
yes’d’y. That's how yer got it!”
with a look that spoke of resignation—for
the time being.
Before saddling up, Hargreaves walked
along the deep gully beside which he had
camped. He fancied that gully. Its bed-
rock was of blue slate, crossed by bars; the
wash of ironstone boulders and quartz and
a hint of porphyry. It was dry except for
the rock-hole Which had given him water.
With a light prospecting pick he chipped
at a pebble-filled crevice running across a
bar. He’d try a prospect, anyway. Hand-
fuls of the gravel he threw in the dish,
scraping deep into the crack with the long
pick-point. Presently his eyes dilated and
his mouth opened. He drew a long breath,
peering into the crack which held wedged
a glistening yellow speck. No need to wash
a dish. The gully carried coarse gold!
The pick slid from Hargreaves’s hands.
He looked up at the sky and laughed with
the birds. Not at any joke, nor yet for the
joy of life, but simply because this first
realisation, following years of anticipation,
forced his nerves to do something—either
cry or laugh. He laughed because when
his mouth opened he couldn’t help it.
He hurried along the gully, chuckling
aloud. He was quite alone and had found
gold, virgin gold. Heavy payable gold. The
joy of discovery must be worked off first.
DE-CODING THE CLOCK.
SILAS: “Fanny ole clock av thine, Jan; 'e do strike any time.”
JAN: “Clock's all right when you do know tin. Now, when big [?]'s on the fower, an'
little 'and’s on the eight, an’ 'e do strike ten ’e’s quatter to nice.”
Back at the crevice he scraped it out with
shaky hands, placing each grain of sand care-
fully in the dish. Experience whispered that
the crevice was a “natural catch.” The dish
would glisten yellow when he’d panned it
off. Carefully he swirled the dish, and the
water licked the gravel away in layers.
Soon his waiting ear caught the scratch of
something solid rolling on the dish bottom.
He chuckled at the diminishing sand. The
yellow pellets began peeping up. And the
gully was his very own.
Hargreaves put the dish aside and laughed
quietly into his hands, then lit the pipe, and
clambering the steep bank strolled into the
bush —just thinking. For two miles his un-
leashed brain ran riot in gold! He
stumbled upon a wide creek with still water.
Not the graceful beauty of hanging vines,
of creeper-trailed palms and drooping orchid,
but the practical use of the water brought
him to his senses.
The very thing! Water to wash the dirt.
It could be liorsepacked here and put through.
The "boys” and their horses could camp here.
Abruptly he turned, intent on pegging a
reward claim and hurrying back to the Coen
to report.
At the gully he hesitated. His six horses
were quietly grazing; the packs lay in the
grass just as he’d unsaddled the night before.
To make certain, he’d try a few dishes all
along the gully, then start for the Coen first
thing to-morrow morning. No sense in start-
ing a local rush if the gully were not rich
enough to justify it. That evening, when too
dark to see the gold in the pannings, he boiled
the billy, ravenously hungry, but not the
least bit tired. The day had been far too
short. After tea he smoked, staring straight
into the fire, thinking clearly at last. He
had proved the gully gold-bearing for a mile.
The head was by far the richest, just where
two ravines junctioned. Each carried gold,
and the rains of centuries had concentrated
both deposits at the junction. Roughly he
estimated £6OOO of gold there alone. About
ten men’s ground. The prospector was en-
titled to five men’s ground. Ten men’s
ground! Five men’s ground! That meant
halving the gold. His share would be half!
Above and below the gully was payable,
but not nearly so rich as at the junction.
Hargreaves’s pipe cooled out. An owl
hooted from the precipitous darkness astride
the coastal range. A mate answered, melodi-
ously, from distance. The stars glinted as
a thousand specks of gold. The piebald’s bell,
night-softened, foretold that he was yet again
starting for the Coen. Hargreaves stared at
the dulling fire.
* * * *
For three weeks following Hargreaves
worked at stoning the gully, breaking rock-
bars. clearing fallen timber, loosening the
gravel bed. Another month and the wet
season would flood the gully with running
water. Then the rushing waters would carry
away the gully gravel, leaving behind the
heavier gold. He would clean up a little
fortune. Himself ! Then report to the Coen.
They could have all the rest of the gully.
One wet season would sluice away ground
that otherwise would mean twelve solid
months’ toil with pick and shovel. And he’d
clean up £6OOO, not £3OOO. He carried ample
tucker. He had the bush to himself.
He worked from streak of dawn to gloom
of night. The bush things hearkened to dull
thuds and saw the moonlight glisten on
freshly-rooted stones being thrown up from
the gully bottom.
One dawn, Hargreaves was returning with
the persevering piebald. He secretly enjoyed
each morning trip now. It gave him some-
thing to growl at. The days were far too
busy, the nights too full of golden dreams
to leave any room for grousing. Except for
the piebald, the unaccustomed luxury would
have been denied him. And then he heard
pick blows! Muffled, but distinct, regular
and systematic, from the hidden depths of
the gully. He dropped the piebald’s halter
and stood very still, quick eyed, something
clutching his heart.
The Coen boys had tracked him! They’d
rushed the gully! He peered down the steep
banks at the junction, and sighed with thank-
fulness on seeing the ground within his own
pegs lay untouched. Walking above the bank
anger gripped him, for around the first bend
worked a line of men, their backs bent, shovel-
blades flashing in the sun. Around the
following bends still, he heard the thud of
picks. Chinamen!
“Get to hell out of this, you yellow
swine!” Hargreaves roared along the bank,
shaking fists at the men, who, without
straightening their backs, gazed up impas-
sively.
“What! you won’t go! By hell!” he
jumped down the bank, his foot turned on a
loose stone and bounced him in a heap to the
bottom. Madly, he rushed the two nearest
Chinamen, who immediately loped up the
gully, gathering their comrades as they ran.
They flew around the first bend
and Hargreaves turned panting
on the men who still watched
from behind.
They fled, pursued by the
white man’s flaming words of
wrath. He turned once again,
his boots crunching heavily in
the loosened gravel. The pick
thuds still vibrated without a
pause. Around the beud and
the shovelmen scattered before
him, this time scaling the gully
walls. Hargreaves ignored them,
and with clenched hands
advanced on the pick-swingers.
One by one they dropped their
tools and walked before him.
He snatched a pick and rushed.
They ran, their bare feet pattering upon
the loose gully stones. With wind fast
failing he chased them around the further
bend. Here worked another line of patient
shovelmen. The pickmen clambered the gully
sides and disappeared. The shovelmen, one
by one, dropped their tools and walked, then
ran before him. He chased them until they,
too, clambered the steep sides and the gully
stretched empty before him. Drawing the
painful breath of exhaustion he climbed the
bank. He was near done. He’d have a billy
of tea before commencing work. He’d
cleaned them all up, anyway.
Chows! Chows rushing a new gold find !
Against the mining laws and against all
white men’s laws. How had they found
him? He’d thought he was all alone in the
great Peninsula bush.
Raking the fire together he paused, listen-
ing like an animal who has baffled the hounds
only to hear their baying again. From the
gully floated the dull, methodical blow of
picks, the muffled scraping of shovels thrust
through sand. Clenching a blazing firestick,
he rushed down amongst the Chinamen.
They scattered and hopped up both banks
like monkeys, to impassively watch the white
man race down the gully. As he disappeared
around the nearest bend, they quietly dropped
back.
A mile down the gully Hargreaves gasped
against a slate bar. He’d cleaned them up
again! This was the limit of the gold run
and there would be none of the yellow rats
down further. With head leaning gratefully
against the cool stone, he strove to ease the
fury within him. Curse it, his beating heart
was mocking him as with the distant thump
of pick blows.
With the easing of his breathing his ears
tingled. It \oas pick blows. From away up
the gully came softly, “thud-thump, thud-
thump.”
Hargreaves walked back, something very
like a sob at his throat.
The Chinamen this time scrambled partly
up the banks, waited until he passed, then
slipped to work again. He walked to the
very gully-head then, laughing queerly at the
work-sounds breaking out behind him, climbed
the bank and reached camp. Grasping
a cartridge-belt he returned. At the nearest
man below he levelled the rifle and shouted
“Go quick ! I shoot!”
All within the bend ceased working, looked
up, then quickly bent to work. Hargreaves s
finger eased on the trigger, a curiously
baffled feeling choking his rage. Along his
rifle-siglits the yellow digger swung his pick
slowly. Hargreaves just simply couldn’t be
a murderer. Almost whimpering, he fired
at a rock beside the toiling figure. The
bullet flattened and its ricochetting frag-
ments shrieked along the gully. Rapidly he
fired and the tortured lead whizzed in the
enclosed space. The Chinamen dropped tools
and fled. Smiling happily, the white man
followed along the bank, firing into the gully
where between bends toiled figures. Once
again he cleaned the gully up and laughed
triumphantly as he gazed down at the rock
on which he had leaned exhausted not an
hour before.
From away up the gully came the sound
of picks at work. Hargreaves toyed aim-
lessly with the trigger. He was beaten.
* * # *
He sat overlooking his own claim, wish-
ing for any Chinaman to put a pick within
his ground. He knew he could shoot a man
for jumping—it was the unwritten law of
gold. But the SO yellow diggers never in
any way interfered with the marked-off
ground. It was ready loosened and stoned
now, waiting only for the thunderstorms to
sweep the debris away.
The Chinamen waited for no storms. Dis-
covery for them meant finis. Forty men
picked, then shovelled off the loose wash ; the
remainder scraped the rock bottom as clean
as a housewife sweeps the floor, and in
baskets carried the dirt to Hargreaves’s
creek. He glanced towards the winding pad
already worn by the loping feet. With tire-
less energy they were working up the gully;
and when the wet did come, with the run-
ning water’s aid they would sweep the bed-
rock as clean as a new pin and disappear
as silently as they had come. And the
whites at the Coen would miss a good gully!
Hargreaves didn’t dare ride and warn them.
He guessed what would happen to his own
ricli ground with SO men working it day
and night. He was helpless. The gold held
him so.
Came the distant clang of the bell of the
piebald sneaking Coen-wards as usual. Har-
greaves stiffened. A smile stole across his
face. He strode to the camp, discarded the
rifle, and, snatching a halter, set out. He
crossed a ravine running into the big creek
and halted, for the bank was undermined.
Close by was an abandoned camp littered
with empty ginger-jars.
He understood then. A couple of Chinese
fossickers had been trying the ravine when
he had found the gully. They had simply
spied, then hurried away back to the Palmer.
Their friends had gathered like hawks to the
feast. Even through his anger Hargreaves
admired that swift bush trek with heavy
baskets of rice.
lie caught tin; piebald and, hurrying back,
picked up his own riding horse. He’d chase
the piebald a good rousing start-off, anyway.
WITH THE EXPERT’S EYE.
FIRST MOTORIST: “Aren’t they beautiful
bird[?]?”
SECOND DITTO: “No; bit too low in the gear-
box.”
Hitching both horses to a tree he slipped off
the piebald’s bell and disappeared within the
tent, where he wrote a note stating all that
was occurring at the gully. Wrapping the
note in canvas he lashed it to the tongue
of the bell. It was protected as within
a metal case. Grinning hugely, he re-
strapped the bell around the piebald’s neck.
The horse would make straight for the
Coen, be at once recognised, the dumb bell
noticed and examined. He slipped the halter
off the piebald and saddled his own horse.
His foot slipped in the stirrup-iron as
sinewy yellow hands grasped the bridle rein.
Amazed, Hargreaves started at the score of
men who had stepped from nowhere. One
tripped inside the tent and slipped away with
the rifle.
Hargreaves sprang for the saddle, but was
jerked sprawling, the frightened horse being
pulled aside and unsaddled. He roared
mockingly as the scared piebald lit out with
tail mast-high, the freed saddle-horse gallop-
ing at his heels. Hargreaves punched and
kicked and bit and scratched. Ten men
rolled atop of him. He was pommelled until
his exhausted body felt a pulp. Through
all his berserk rage he dumbly wondered that
he could not struggle up. Somehow he had
never realised that Chinamen possess pugna-
nacious strength the same as other men.
They left him there. Evidently they were
determined to work the gully out without
interference. He shaded his eyes from the
sun and laughed.
A week later, Hargreaves from the gullv
bank watched the blue ribbon of smoke that
rose straight up from his galley fire. On a
razor-back spur, clearly silhouetted, sat a
statuesque horseman. Hargreaves hurried to
the fire and stirred denser the column of
smoke. Along the spur, at a canter, wound
an increasing file of horsemen.
As if holding the joke of a century, Har-
greaves walked to the gully-bank and laughed
down at the sweating men below.

Home Coming.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SHE will be waiting for me there
Beside the gate that tops the rise,
Waiting, and watching for me, where
The lime-tree leans against the skies.
For when the sunset splendors blur
The west with wafts of tangerine,
She knows that I will come to her
My car glides on through walls of green.
Or crimson-tipped or silver-grey
The trees beside me curve and reel,
As lazy-tense I watch the way
And lightly swing the steering-wheel.
By hairpin-bend and trestle-bridge
The pulsing "six” beneath me purrs,
By sudden rise and sandy ridge,
Breathing like low wind through the firs.
And round the curves and skirting ruts
I swing to left or swing to right,
And peer where now the roadway butts
Level into the sunset light.
Yet still that picture greets my eyes:
The lime-tree there beside the gate,
And Maisie, standing on the rise,
Patient and sure and calm as fate.
A sunset-vision in my sight,
Ever recurrent, unforgot,
So vivid that the blaze of light,
Blinding the road, still dims it not.
And four miles, three miles now, to go.
The breathing engine well might be
A sentient thing. It seems to know
That even now she waits for me.
The road slides back beneath the wheels.
The long car glides through golden light,
Throbbing as though it thrills and feels
A need to race the racing night.
The last long curve, a leafy bend.
One moment more and T shall see
The homestead gate, the journey’s end,
And Maisie waiting by the tree.
There she is now, sure as the fates,
Under the shadow of the lime!....
For Maisie damwell always waits,
Mooing for me at milking time.

BARTLETT ADAMSON.
Mary’s Boys.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MHS. NOLAN had always had a hard
enough life “without this happen-
ing.” No one said just what “this”
was; yet everyone seemed to know. Just
being Martin Nolan’s wife was hard, any-
way. Not that he was a wife-beater exactly,
but there was a warped, cantankerous side
to his nature that kept him always at wav
with something. Strikes, religion, politics,
fences, stock —always he was fighting for or
with someone on principle. So strenuous
were his quarrels that the commonplace busi-
ness of providing for a large family was
overlooked.
So through long years of toil and hard-
ship it was Mrs. Nolan who battled and
raised their seven careless sons and one dear
daughter, Mary. And now Mary was in
trouble. It was cruel she should fall in love
with handsome Lou Maples, the horse-
breaker. He was as a Montague to the
Nolans' Capulet. Long before Mary had mot
him, Martin had fought him with words and
fists over matters political and, later and
unsuccessfully, in court over the ownership
or a thoroughbred colt which Lou claimed
had strayed from his mob into Martin’s pad-
dock.
Martin was a consistent hater. Lou
Maples courting his Mary—he’d shoot him
on sight first! He consoled Mary, who was
not yet twenty-one, by telling her that, baby
or no baby, she was better off with an honest
name like Noinn than that of a dirty horse-
thief like Maples.
THE SPREAD OF CHRISTIANS.
THE NEW SHEPHERD : “In Australia they give us most
hopeful statistics of the spread of Christianity in
these islands.”
THE SHEEP : “Don't you, believe it. Boiled down, the
missionaries’ figures are of no account.”
Lou meant well, but he was a busy man,
carrying on business as a horse-dealer and
-breaker and long-distance drover, and
obstacles kept . cropping up. So in the
spacious and time-careless way of the bush
things drifted till Mary's boy was a year
old almost, and their elopement still un-
fulfilled.
Then a mulga wire came through to Mary
that Lou had been smashed up and was like
to die on an out-station where he had been
breaking-in. Mary left her toddler with her
mother, saddled a good horse and made her
way across the 200-odd miles of country to
where Lou lay with some fractured ribs, a
concussion and a broken ankle. A doctor
came out and set the bones, but it was
Mary’s care and horse-sense that drew him
back to health again.
They were not unpleasant months the pair
passed in that hut on the out-station. It
was one of those exceptionally good years
when the whole bush blossoms as a garden.
Everyone on the station was anxious to make
things pleasant for the breaker’s “plucky
little wife.” Mary was a born home-maker.
The hut became a sort of salon where all
the random society of the station, dropping
in for a yarn, was entertained. It was so
comforting to Mary to be addressed as Mrs.
Maples that they decided not to spoil it by
getting a priest out to marry them and adver-
tising their singleness. They would wait till
Lou was well and then slip away to the
big city and get married. Then they would
take a house in some town on one of the
great stock routes, and Mary could live like
a lady with her boy.
When at last Lou was fit again it seemed
a pity to travel idle after making nothing for
so long; so he took a contract to deliver a
mob of fats on their way down south.
Things went smoothly enough—Mary was
always a smart little rider, and they had a
couple of blackboys to help—until their last
night out. They were to have delivered the
cattle at the railhead next day. But some-
thing roused the beasts in the night. Lou
was racing in the dark to head them when
his horse crashed through a wombat-burrow
and came down on top of him. The doctor’s
account of it was that death was instantane-
ous—his neck was broken.
Mary did not indulge in hysterics. She
delivered the cattle to the agents, collected
payment, paid off the blackboys, sold some
of the horses and saw poor Lou Miaples
decently buried in the township cemetery.
Then she lifted her square, freckled face
above the ruin and chaos of her life and set
out on the long, dreary ride home to Dingo
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.
MAISIE (who wants to chatter) : “My hubby says he can read me like a book.”
DAISIE (who wants to read) : “Yes, dear; but he can't shut you up like one!”
Flat —alone. Six months later she died in
her mother’s arms after having given birth
to Lou Maples’s second son.
Then it was that the cackle and gossip of
Dingo Flat was let loose in earnest. They
said Mrs. Nolan had no proper feeling as a
mother, the way she tock it all so calm and
soft. For Mrs. Nolan, her worn face won-
derfully like Mary’s, met the storm with her
philosophy. Lou Maples, she said, couldn’t
have been a bad man, else her Mary could
never have taken to him so. Anyway, the
best men had some women busy forgiving
them most of their lives. Goodness knows,
Martin Nolan’s wife had plenty of practice
in forgiving. But deep down in her heart
the stigma hurt her sorely. She wished,
poor soul, that she could have spoken of
‘‘My daughter Mrs. Maples’s sons,” instead
of just “Mary’s boys.”
Not that there was much time to grieve
over it. Two babies to keep
and care for, and she a
woman getting up in years,
with less vigor than a mother
should have. For she had to
earn for them as well as
tend them; out there on the
selection she was alone most
of the time milking, slaving
about with poultry and goats
and a garden, driving into
town in the old waggonette
for things. Martin came
home only once in a blue
moon—a toss-up whether
he’d be drunk or sober;
whether he had any money
or not. And always, mind
you, a welcome for him just
as though he’d been Darby
and she Joan, instead of
what they were. That’s the
sort of woman Mrs. Nolan
was.
They grew into fine boys.
As time went on it worried
Mrs. Nolan that there was
no school near. She had
taught them what she could,
but it wasn’t much as a
schoolmaster would reckon.
It was when Johnny was eight and Son
nearly ten that Martin got sent up on a
stiff sentence for horse-stealing. “Illegally
using,” his lawyer had pleaded, but it was
no good. There had been trouble enough in
the family before, but they had been free of
the gaol taint. Mrs. Nolan vowed she’d
bring Mary’s boys up so they would be a
credit to her. Vicariously those boys atoned
for old Martin’s shortcomings by the thor-
oughness with which they did their chores
and said their prayers, the frequency with
which they washed, the respectfulness of
their speech.
Mrs. Nolan had the old waggonette done
up at the blacksmith's, got a couple of decent
horses and took- the mail contract between
Dingo Flat, Waggee and Harrow. Three
days a week, by rising at unearthly hours,
she landed the boys at Waggee school by
nine, picked up the mails and on to Harrow
before noon ; waited there for the afternoon
train (with the family-sewing for pastime),
then back with the mail in time to pick up
the boys after school and home again. And
at home she had horses and other animals
to care for and supper to get. In between
mail-days there were home-lessons and house-
work and other errands. But Mrs. Nolan was
willing to make sacrifices, and she dreamed
of her grandsons living civilised lives in neat
cottages in some town instead of the bar-
baric wandering life her own sons followed.
Occasionally, at rare intervals, one of these
big, tanned uncles would ride up to Dingo
Flat, greet Mrs. Nolan with a “Well, Mum !”
—as if they’d ridden out a few hours instead
of years before —stop a few days, yarn
casually of things and places out back in a
way that held Son and Johnny breathless
and spellbound, and do a few odd jobs about
the selection. Then one day the visitor
would saddle up, mention something about
a well-sinking contract or shearing or some
vague work, give the boys a handful of loose
silver apiece, say so-long and vanish as
casually as he had come.
For four years school went on, and the
boys did well. The postmistress got one a
job on the railways. The storekeeper took
the other to help in his office. But a safe
job in a town was not for Lou Maples’s sons.
Their blood would not stand it. At sixteen
Son was an understudy on a cattle-camp in
West Queensland. At the same age Johnny
was riding and helping to train racehorses
on country tracks. Save for more regular
letters they passed from their grandmother’s
life as completely as had her own sons.
Came the Great War with its call for
volunteers. The Nolans heard that call scat-
tered in whatever far corner they were, and
it was a full family muster that answered.
Johnny had to add a few imaginary months
to his age, but he and Son enlisted together.
Even old Martin tried to enlist; and when
the sergeant turned him down he took it as
another insult to Ireland —to think that an
Irishman, however old, wasn't as good as
any Britisher and better than twice his
weight in Germans!
The war years dragged on. Son and
Johnny had arranged for the sending of a
regular allowance to their grandmother. It
kept the wolf further from the door, pro-
, bably, than Mrs. Nolan could remember.
Then Martin took ill and died. While she
was up, day and night, nursing him, Mrs.
Nolan was her old fighting self. When he
''•as gone, when for the first time in her life
lb ?re was no one to work and fight for, she
seemed to fail, as if there was nothing more
to live for. Three of her sons had been
killed, and young Johnny, too. Perhaps of
all the children she had reared it was for
young Johnny she grieved most. Even the
news that Son had won a V.C. and was com-
ing home did not rouse her. Her house was
in order, there was money in the bank to
bury her decently beside her husband —some-
thing over even for Son when he came home.
She took to her bed and never rose again.
Private Nolan, V.C., was expected home
on the day of his grandmother’s funeral.
The local Welcome Home Committee was in
a quandary. It could not forbear giving its
only V.C. a public welcome, yet it looked
unseemly to clash with the funeral. The
township finally agreed on a a compromise.
The committee, the shire councillors and the
band would meet him at the train, read the
address and march a bit down the main
street. Then they’d quietly disband, the
Shire President would motor the Y.C. out
to Dingo Flat in time for the funeral and
take him home as his guest till the youngster
had settled his affairs a bit.
Private Nolan stepped from the train half
wondering why he had come. He had no ties
here now the old lady had gone. Not such
a load of happy childhood memories even.
But he stood respectfully at attention while
flags waved and the Shire President read an
address of welcome. He had been trained
to stand respectfully at attention at parades,
and he had seen enough of war to know that
flags and speeches did not count for very
much. Remembering the intense indiffer-
ence with which Waggee had regarded his
pre-war career, he decided that in this case
they counted for very little, and he felt
rather bored and lonely. But he thanked
them, and did his best at making a speech
when they seemed to expect it. Then they
TOO RISKY.

to miss a beat.”
EDITOR : “Take it away. I don't want any-
thing that will affect the circulation.”
executed a triumphal march down the street,
and he went on in the Shire President’s car
to Dingo Flat.
The town had spread out now, so that the
Flat seemed nearer. When it came in view
it seemed as if the whole of his old life were
spread out before him. There was the pool
in the creek where he and Johnny had
learned to swim. He could pick out the
panel in the fence he had crawled under the
time tlie bull had torn his pants—he had
saved his skin —probably his life —by about
the thickness of those pants. There was
the house; everything so poor and old, yet
so neat and clean looking.
They went in. There were about a dozen
neighbors in the front room. They talked
in a strained sort of way a little while. Then
an elderly woman who seemed to be. in
charge asked if he wouldn’t like to see “her.”
He went up to the room where his grand-
mother lay on a bed with lace pillows. She
looked very peaceful; not any more old and
worn than as he remembered seeing her last.
Her withered old hands were folded on her
breast. He had never seen them so still and
idle before.
She had been mighty good to him —and
everybody, lie wished she would open her
eyes now so that he could tell her so. He
wondered why he hadn’t thought to tell her
so before. Perhaps nobody had ever told
her. She represented all In; had ever known
of home or parents—she and Johnny. And
now Johnny was lying out there on Gal-
lipoli. He thought about her battling with
the mails in all weathers on bad roads so
that he and Johnny could get a bit of school-
ing. He thought about her sitting up all
night with a gun the time a snake got under
the wall-lining, while he and Johnny slept
in her big bed with the clothes tucked well
up from the floor. He thought about her
on the shingle roof putting out sparks that
dreadful day when the bush-fires were all
around them ; of the time the cows were put
in the pound. That crowd at the station —
where were they then?
The Shire President stood awkwardly at
the door, a glass in his hand. He was won-
dering if he ought to ask Private Nolan to
drink good luck or bon voyage to the de-
ceased —or what he ought to do.
With sudden inspiration Son Nolan took
the Victoria Cross from his tunic and fast-
ened it in the lace of his grandmother’s best
nightdress.
“She earned it more than me,” he said to
the astonished President. “She put up a
brave fight all her life. It only took me a
few minutes to get that machine-gun and
use it.”
Another inspiration came to him. “And
I’d like her to have a military funeral, too,”
he added.
“A damn good idea,” said the Presi-
dent. “I’ll just slip out and see about it.”
So the President slipped out and got to-
gether again the Welcome Home Committee,
the Red Cross branch and the band and the
Patriotic League and anybody at all who
had a military uniform, and they marched
out and gave Mrs. Nolan the greatest funereal
turn-out that Waggee or Dingo Flat had
ever seen.
Father Ryan preached a sermon at the
grave—something about her worth being
above rubies and rising early and resting
late. Just like her, Son thought. He went
over and shook hands with the priest.
It seemed to set everyone remembering
good turns and kindnesses she had done;
things they had never found occasion to remem-
ber while she lived. So it seemed natural,
after the service, for band and mourners to
break out spontaneously with “For She’s a
Jolly Good Fellow.”
That moved Son most of all. The lonely
outcast feeling that had shadowed him all
his life—ever since, with child instinct, he
and Johnny had divined that in some in-
tangible way they were a disgrace to their
grandmother—slipped from him, and a
strange new contentment came.
He lifted his voice and sang with the rest,
feeling proud to be just a Nolan, proud of
his grandmother, and proud of old Dingo
Flat.

Searle's Brumbies.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE were talking "horse” and feats of
horsemanship at the station-yards
when Searle rode up. He had come
along in answer to a message sent him by
the manager that some beast carrying his
biand had been mustered with the station
lieid. If yoii can yard those brumbies
that are in my paddock,” lie grinned, “I’ll
give you the pick of a dozen of them, with a
clean receipt.” The eyes of the stockman
lit up, and looks of interrogation were flashed
to each other. “There are thirty altogether,”
he added—“or ought to be, if some haven't
broken their necks lately. Me an’ McCurdy
put them there three years ago when some
of ’em could hardly carry their hides, and
they’ve never been yarded since.”
"Right,” Burton said, speaking for the
company. Its a wager; well have ago
at them.”
‘‘Sojne Sunday V” Kouhu suggested.
Whenever you like, an’ I’ll give you a
hand myself. But you'll want the best horses
you can bring with you, and a spare one or
two it you can manage it.” Then, grinning
again, he went off to the store to see the
manager.
Searle’s paddock was in the Great Divid-
ing Range, an area of mountain spurs and
i ldges where gum and box and oak grew
m abundance. It was hacked and sliced
into, shapeless hollows and Hats, gaping
gullies and dry watercourses, paved with
stones and pebbles worn smooth and round
by the wind and rain and sun of a thousand
years. It rises in my memory as far from
any settlement, and the haunt of every-
thing that was wild and shy and strange.
Great grey peaks poked high above it. Hang-
mg over its gorges and terrible hollows was
a tableland upon which bulky hills coated
with rank feathery grass sat like huge warts.
II ad halt the stones on it been gold nuggets
it would have been an inexhaustible treasure.
Its gullies could rise into roaring flood in
twenty minutes when seasons were good,
and empty themselves in almost as many
seconds. It was a mountain hell-liole, but
little explored. It had kangaroos, wallabies,
possums, bandicoots and bears ; it had slink-
ing black goannas and snakes in plenty. To
be thrown in that paddock, or if your horse
iell with you, might mean your lobbing near
a reptile taking a sun-bath or digesting its
dinner, or a couple of them love-making.
It was an ideal environment for wild horses,
for it made them wilder. But as a place
tor yarding them, or running them out
through an opening into the boundless bush
it was sheol.
You entered it by a set of slip-panels
leading into a high sapling yard erected in
a corner. The boundary fences running
from it at right angles served as “wings.”
A cleared patch of three or four acres in
front was punctured with stump-lioles deep
enough to bury a bullock in. Save for a
number of scattered jam-tins and sardine-
Uns and a few sheets of bark propped against
each other for a humpy, to crawl into if it
rained, no other evidences of civilisation
were visible.
It was a merry group that rode into that
old yard one calm and tranquil Sunday,
greeting its shattered rails and over-growth
of weeds with lively commentary, and dis-
mounting to unsaddle and change to fresh
horses. One among the group, I remember,
was Marie Searle, a girl of eighteen. Some
of them gathered wood to light a fire and
boil the billy; others turned to and mended
the broken rails and made the enclosure
secure. No time was wasted over lunch;
for with bridle-reins hooked to our arms we
stood round the billy, with a pannikin in
one hand and some bread and beef in the
other. Beyond a few words of chaff on the
chances of “spills” and a difference of opin-
ion as to the whereabouts of the brumbies
very little was said.
“Now then, if you’re all ready”—and toss-
ing his empty pannikin into the humpy,
Searle mounted his brown colt Mountaineer.
Someone helped the girl into the saddle and
tightened the surcingle. And, now when
one thinks of it, what risks she took in that
old horned side-saddle and riding-habit! But
in any pattern of saddle, Marie Searle, with
her dancing eyes and laughing teeth, was
quite at home in the bush on the back of a
horse.
We left the yard in two divisions—one
riding to the right, the other to the left.
I went, to the right with Searle and the girl.
In a few moments we were climbing the
low point of a spur of the range known
as the Razorback. Beyond it lay a dark
gorge cut in tw r o by the boundary fence.
The girl had under her a chestnut mare that
had made a name for herself down on the
Texas side, whore brumbies were plentiful.
As she rose in the saddle to ease the mare in
the ascent, I remember how she snatched
sprays of wattle and stuck them in the
bridle, for it was the wattle season. And
what a sight in yellow and gold was the
Great Divide! The perfume drifting from
those mountain blooms for the time took our
minds off the brumbies. But on reaching
the top we were alert for a glimpse or sound
of the mob.
“Likely as not,” Searle said, “Burton and
those will drop on them beneath the narrow
gap. But if the mob is separated we might
hit some of them about here, so look out.”
On we rode in silence, scanning every
object ahead, the spur stretching wider
and wider to either side of us.
“I’ll drop over here into Dark Gorge,”
Searle said, speaking again. “You keep going
on slowly, and we’ll meet again at the spring
where the fence comes up the range. If I
eoo-ee you’ll know I’ve started them. Turn
them when they come up into Stockyard
Gorge, if you can. but don’t let them back
this way, or they’ll go down over Razorback
the wrong way and double round on us.” Then
down over the side he went —dipping, sliding,
slipping, till he disappeared from view.
The girl and I rode on over flagstones,
through clumps of rosemary, oak-trees and
pines. Our horses moved briskly, the chest-
nut mare majestic and grand. Bluebelle toss-
ing her head to snatch at the reins. They
trotted eagerly up over a stone shelf to a
box-tree flat.
Suddenly a coo-ee echoed out of Dark
Gorge. Our hearts gave a jump and so did
our horses. Then came another. The chest-
nut and Bluebelle had to be steadied. Still,
with pricked ears, they watched hard through
the timber. Something more than what the
coo-ees gave warning of was afoot. In front
of us, behind the wallaby brush, began a
commotion, a crackling of dry sticks, then
round it, full gallop, came six—eight—nine
—ten startled brumbies, right in line with
us. We knew that wild horses stick blindly
to their course, and that loitering long in
their way wasn’t healthy. A nervous shout,
perhaps, escaped us, then our hands took
short grips of the reins. Bluebelle went
up in the air, and tapped the ground play-
fully as she balanced again. They were
almost upon us, when she swung like the
handle of a windlass released, and off in
amongst them ! When I regained my breath
and knew what her game was, she was
racing close in with the leaders. Gad, the
thrill of it! In an eyeflash I saw the chest-
nut mare racing between a dull-bay and a
brown. Over the stone-shelf the whole
galloping lot of us dashed, hoofs ringing and
rattling on the loose flint stones like clashes
of steel. For the Razorback, then down to
the left and back into Dark Gorge, they
were making. It was ours to hold them and
force them down to the right. So on through
the wattles and rosemary we rattled it out
with the wind at our throats and hanging
boughs slapping our faces. No room and no
place for a whip, but we swung our hats
out at their heads. To the Razorback we
held them; they swerved to the right: then
down they went into Stockyard Gorge,
making as much noise as the thunders on
Mount Sinai when Jehovah was laying down
the law. So far we had won. We gave the
horses a blow, then with parched mouths
trotted them back to the spring.
Searle was there, off his horse, waiting.
THE LOWER MATHEMATICS.
FARMER (short of labor ) : “Look here, Jacky, you dig that crop of spuds for me, and
I give you half.”
J ACKY (after some aboriginal arithmetic): “No fear, boss. Whole plurry crop don ’
make more’n half.”
Wild bees were there, too, in plenty. Fallen
blossoms from overhanging boughs lay thick
around the spring; but the hole was dry,
and its trampled muddy bed filled us with
a sinister gloom.
“About twenty of them came up the
gorge,” Searle said, as we rode on over the
tableland. “They kept on the fence and
must have come up when you were racing
the others back, but there’s no need to
hurry.” This, because of the chestnut mare
and Bluebelle showing an eagerness to jump
off again. “Most likely Burton and those
will meet them in the Narrow Gap. If they
do there’ll be some hard riding directly.”
Hardly had he spoken when a round of
whistling snorts on the blossom-scented air
thrilled us again. On ahead in an open
patch stood the brumbies, staring as w r e
came through the broom-bush, their heads
held high in line. A bunch of wild horses on
the watch is a sight to see; it starts one’s
blood tingling. Next instant they were gone.
Wheeling as one horse, they left like a field
sent from the barrier to a perfect start.
A shake of the reins, a touch of the heels,
and Searle and the colt were in pursuit.
An experienced brumby runner he was, w r ith
a steady, crouching seat, a quick unerring
eye and light hands, and he rode a little
“long.” Something as to “wheeling them,”
and “the gorge.” and the “gap” was flung
back as the colt dashed through the under-
growth. No yelling or whooping rang out.
for Searle was a silent horseman. The man
who yells on the gallop on the mountains
is not usually “heady.” But Searle wasn’t
to have the run all to himself. Bounding at
his heels was the chestnut mare, taking
advantage of the course the brown was
smashing through the brush, and almost pull-
ing the girl over the saddle. Out wide
rattled little Bluebelle, choosing her own
course, watching her footing where the
ground was broken, her eyes fixed on the
flying mob where the going was good. Soft-
mouthed and free as the wind itself, she
was; so sensitive on the bit, in fact, that
a mistaken touch when her mind was made
up would be fatal. And she could think
and decide quicker than we could. In tight
places she only thought once. By the prick
of her ears we knew what was in her mind,
by the touch and swing of our body she
knew when we understood. To pull her
when in doubt or in a funk when shaving
the trunk of a tree would have meant eter-
nity ! As she opened out, those gums and
oaks were flung behind in rapid procession !
But fast as she paced the brown kept his
lead. Through brambles and brush the mob
held their own and held together. In the
flush of the gallop we felt plunged into the
thick of life. Yet a false stride, a hoof
planted on a rolling stone, and we would
have been in the thick of the dust.
Searle was riding to head them off Narrow
Gap, directing them over the side into Stock-
yard Gorge to join with the others. On
reaching the Gap the brumbies had set their
minds. Nothing else had they in view. Once
through and they would be lost in a hell-
hole of jungle. And Searlc’s weight was
telling on the colt. Misjudging a water-
course, he fumbled the jump and lost some
ground. Recovering his stride lie answered
the heels, and followed as game as a pebble.
Round some rocks, then over a shelf and
across a brush flat. Five chains on ahead
the mob was still showing the way, but
started to “tail.” Two more furlongs and
the leaders would fly through the gap. Searle
called on the colt, then glanced back at the
girl. The nose of the chestnut was there
at his flank, her mouth open wide, and the
girl holding tight. He knew the mare of
old.
“Let her out!” rang from him; and the
girl let her go. She passed the colt; then
after the “tail,” a dusty green grey and
a shaggy-maned black. Then Bluebelle, too,
got her head, and out from the wattles she
shot. She answered to our heels rapping
hard at her sides and * the saddle lifted to
the strength of her loins. Swinging clear
of a low mistletoe, despising the grass-trees,
rounding a leaning rock-pile, her hoofs cut-
ting deep in the damp mossy ground, shorten-
ing her course by a gully jump, she emerged
from an oak belt alongside the mare. To-
gether we passed the grey, floundering and
blowing, then past the shaggy-maned black.
Six lengths off, the leaders were bunched,
their tails out-flying, their stretch undimin-
ished. Ahead of them with a clear run
between was the gaping Gap. Every stride
took them nearer. We could see them waver-
ing, see them rocking and changing their
stride. Their ears lay back, their heads
outstretched. The girl urged the chestnut.
Now up with the leader; now nearer and
nearer the Gap! Wheel them, or through it
and into the hell-hole the lot of us must
go. A stride or two more—then suddenly
they swerved ! Gad !
We dropped from the saddles and slackened
the girths. The sweat fairly ran from those
horses on the ground. Their red, open nos-
trils steamed like engines. Their blood-
speckled hoofs tramped round and round us.
Their sides heaved and thumped as though
they never would stop. The wind started
the towering trees breathing all round.
Bright parrots from hanging branches
screamed their loudest. A rattling of hoofs
on the loose stones near by, then some voices,
and Burton and the others filed through the
narrow Gap.
“Hello!” they called —“did you strike
them?” Then looks of envy and disappoint-
ment filled their faces as they noted our
sweat-stained horses champing and stamp-
ing around.
Searle explained in few words, then briefly
outlined the next move.
“Gripes!” they said. “Let us get into the
gorge and after them.”
Searle lifted the girl into her saddle again;
then abreast we rode to the edge of the range,
all of us on the look-out for an easy way
down. Their toes rested light on the irons:
their brown, freckled hands pressed over the
pommels. There was no talking, save a few
mumbled words to encourage the horses. All
silent men for the most part they were, full
of inarticulate knowledge of the bush. Down
the side we went, some picking their own
way, others following the leaders to use the
track they were blazing. Left alone, the
horses, with lowered watchful heads, slid on
all fours, rested, zig-zagged, sidled, fox-
trotted under ledges and along edges of
cliffs, while huge creepy snakes slithered out
of the way. and the rock-wallabies peeped
curiously from their holes like humans
watching from the windows of their habita-
tions. Lifting your eyes from the horses
when their rumps were nigh knocking your
shoulders one saw nothing in view but sky
and massed treetops away below, and great
eagles with outstretched wings soaring above
them. And so the bottom was reached and
we were in Stockyard Gorge.
“Now then,” Searle directed, “you had
better spread out here, make a net of your-
selves and ride on towards the yard. A
couple of you get near the fence; some of
you keep along the foot of the range, and
the rest keep in between. If you fellows”
—those following the foot of the range—
“can block tbem from getting over at Razor-
back, and the rest of you keep on their
heels, they must face the yard and go in.”
Then we spread out. But scarcely had
we taken our allotted places when the sound
of whistling snorts rang out in the broom-
bush, and off started the brumbies in full
force. Some shouting and calls of warning,
then came a reckless crashing through timber,
cracking of brambles, and a ringing of hoofs
on flagstones and metal. Burton, on Wall
Eye, and Fitz, on Black Hippy, rode to wheel
them off Razorback. The rest of us followed.
Wallaby tracks and bi-umby pads, leading to
the water, wound through the gorge, and
vines and brush that would drag you from
the saddle if your legs got looped in them
were in plenty. But no tracks for horse-
men were cut there. Pulling and straining,
our horses shirked nothing. They hurdled
dead timber where gullies were wide, they
plunged to the beds of them and up the steep
banks with the saddles right back on their
loins. But black Hippy and Wall Eye sur-
prised and baffled and wheeled the fleeing
brumbies.
Their wild staring heads were now facing
the yard. Only the cleared patch lay
between. One rush and across it, and they’d
all be in. Our hearts were thumping. But
at the cleared patch they baulked as they
wheeled. Of unsheltered patches and
corners those brumbies were suspicious—
suspicious of everything touched by the hand
of man. They broke through the cordon
of horsemen and at every angle they pounded
back down the gorge again. Then there was
riding—spurring, ducking, twisting and turn-
ing ! There were crashes and curses, lost
hats and lost tempers, and shirt-tails flying.
There were brumbies colliding, brumbies
behind and beside us as well as in front of us.
there were shouts to the girl to go steady,
and there was Kouhn on the ground scramb-
ling out of a gully. Then back to the
cleared patch in twos and threes and fours,
puffing and floundering, they came; crossed
it, and straight for the yard they headed.
Oli, for the joy of it! But they halted and
stopped, bunched in confusion beside it. Dust
flew up and around them.
The desire was to charge in a force then.
“Keep back—give them time,” Searle ordered
breathlessly. Our hearts were thumping and
choking us then. Those brumbies were ring-
ing, crushing, shoving their heads over the
necks of each other, and under each other’s
flanks.
“Dammit, the rails are up!"
At that agonised shout the rest of us
stared and gaped, and a sick feeling seized
us. No one even had the spirit to swear.
So we sat there in our saddles in silence,
while the brumbies got their wind, knowing
that any second they’d break back again in
a blind, mad stampede.
“There’s nothing else for it,” Searle almost
wept. “Someone go over and throw the
rails down, and chance it.”
Hearne, whose horse was nearly done, rode
forward.
Ghosts and devils! No sooner did he
approach them than with snorts and whistles
and the wildest manifestations of terror, the
mob were off, scattering pell-mell and nearly
running over the lot of us! And when the
last of them had got away, two riderless
horses went trotting across the open, while
back in the gorge in the bed of a gully, with
her neck broken, lay Kouhn’s big bay marc.
With sore hearts we rode over and exam-
ined the yard. Not only were the rails up.
but they were carefully pegged, and those
opening on the bush were down!
“By the Lawd! Searle hissed, “If I get
hold of the fellow whose been here and played
this trick I’ll settle with him.”
Just then a squibby sort of whip-crack
rang out, and looking round we saw old
Maloney on his plough-horse, stock-riding a
cow and calf that had been lost to him for
six months. All of us looked at Searle.
then at each other, and laughed a sickly sort
of laugh. Approaching the yard where the
cow began to make trouble, Maloney looked
nn from under his big hat and shouted:
“Damn yez all. can’t yez get away out of
that to let th’ baist go in?”

A Song of the Old Days.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I DREAMT last night of old roads, of
1 long roads, of wide roads
That wandered through the Outback
when fences were unknown ;
I travelled out to Boulia, to Camooweal, to
Darwin
Across the shifting sandhills the westerlies
had blown.
And there I met the old men, the strong men,
the true men
Who blazed the tracks in ’eighty, and
they remembered me,
And we went round the old sheds, the big
sheds, the blade sheds,
And there we found no union, and no
macliinerv.
1 saw' the gidya forests, the mulga, the
brigalow,
And kangaroos and emus, half hidden in
the grass
That waved beside the long tracks, the red
tracks, the grey tracks
Where horse teams and bullock teams and
packhorse drovers pass.
1 saw the old bush shanties, slab shanties,
drab shanties
And heard the glasses clinking, and saw
them on the bar,
Where stood a group of shearers, of drovers,
of rousies
All weather-worn and dusty, for they had
travelled far.
There was a pile of old swags, of clean swags,
of mean swags;
Some were rolled in oilcloth and some
in calico,
And all w'ere owned by true men, by square
men, by fair men
Who knew the sheds from Burketown
down to the Warrego;
Whose only creed was work hard, was drink
hard, was die hard,
Their billycans and tucker-bags were piled
beside the door;
And while they spent their shed cheques, the
blue cheques, the red cheques,
Their lame dogs and game dogs were rest-
ing on the floor.
And on the rail were saddles, men’s saddles,
stock saddles,
And hanging by the saddles were bridles
new and old;
And then I heard the horse bells, the bronze
bells, the brass bells,
That tinkled soft as silver, and shone like
polished gold.
HE KNEW HIS LIMIT.
OUT-BACK PUB-KEEPER: “It’s forty miles to
th’ next pub.”
MATILDA’S MAN: “Well, yer better give me
two more pints. I can only go thirty
miles to the gallO."
Ere break of day came sorrow, dull sorrow,
grim sorrow.
For I had been with old friends and then
we had to part.
For I had been with my friends, my old
friends, my good friends,
And daylight came in sorrow and I was
sore at heart.

JIM GRAHAME.
The Last Hour: A One-
Act Play.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CHARACTERS:
The Condemned Man, The Clergyman,
The Gaol Governor, The Warder.
Scene : The “Condemned Cell” of a prison.
At the hack an iron door with the usual
observation grating. The only article of
furniture is a stone bench.
The Prisoner, a man of a refined type, hag-
gard of aspect, and dressed in prison clothes ,
is pacing restlessly to and fro. A bell
begins tolling very slowly. At the first sound
the Prisoner starts and listens; at the second,
recognising its import, he shudders.
The Warder enters, followed by the Gov-
ernor, the former locking the door after
them. They are the unemotional officials of
their class; formal and level of voice, but
kindly and considerate in manner. The Pri-
soner continues his walk.
Warder : Tl;e Governor to see you, Pri-
soner. (The Prisoner takes no notice for
a moment or so. ) Attention, please !
The Prisoner stops, unused to such disci-
pline, and fronts them.
Governor : Is there anything you would like,
Prisoner?
Prisoner (shortly) : No, thanks.
Governor: Any message you wish to leave?
Prisoner: No.
Governor (after a pause) : It is my duty to
remind you that the execution is timed
for nine o’clock—that will be in an hour.
Prisoner: Were you afraid I would forget
the appointment? With that bell, too!
Governor: I will have it stopped if you
would like that.
NOT ON HIS MENU.
HARASSED HOUSEWIFE: “Give you something! I will if you don’t clear out—a taste of
the dog.”
SWAGGTE : “Will you be so good as to excuse me, lady — I’m a vegetarian!”
Prisoner ( sincerely) : Thanks. You are
very kind.
Governor : I remind yon also that you are
at liberty to have a clergyman of your
own choice to attend you on the scaffold.
Prisoner ( curtly ) : Thanks now for nothing.
I don’t want one. Why persecute me with
this empty formula, this pretence of spiri-
tual consolation? Consolation! At least,
spare me that!
Governor : Then the prison chaplain is avail-
able.
Prisoner ( with increasing scorn) : The
prison chaplain! The official, paid pur-
veyor of comfort to those about to be
strangled!
Governor : Be calm, Prisoner. You will
have no one thrust on you ; but I mention
it because just now there is a clergyman
waiting at the gate who is anxious to offer
you his services.
Prisoner: What, a pure volunteer?
Governor : Yes.
Prisoner (more reasonably) : Well. I’m
obliged to him. There is no-suspicion, at
any rate, that he is an official stipendiary
agent of the Almighty. Who is he?
Governor: A Reverend Mr. Wilkins. Do
you know him?
Prisoner: No. What’s his special brand
of dogma?
Governor: I don’t know him either. He
belongs to some sort of small church —
“Christian Brethren,” or something like
that.
Prisoner : Well, it’s decent of him, and he’ll
help to annihilate a bad hour. Show him
in.
Governor (going) : And I’ll see about that
h 11. By the way, I will allow you to
blindfold yourself before coming out on
the drop, if you feel very nervous about
it. The Warder will guide you out, and
you will see nothing. He has brought the
bandage with him.
Prisoner: Many thanks for your considera-
tion.
The Governor goes out. The Warder stays.
Warper : You asked for something to read.
(ITe holds out a Bible.)
Prisoner: What is it? A Bible? I didn’t
ask for that.
Warder : No, but it’s usual. You asked for
something humorous, so I’ve also brought
you these papers.
He shows a gaudy “comic supplement ,”
such as is issued by American journals.
Prisoner (grimly) : The Bible and “Comic
Snaps”! Well you are doing your best
to infuse a little humor into your grue-
some job. Accept my thanks.
The Warder places the black bandage,
Bible and papers on the bench, then goes to
the door. The Prisoner picks up the sinis-
ter bandage gingerly and drops it with a
perceptible tremor. Then, as the Warder
makes no move, turns to him testily.
Prisoner: Well? What about that ghostly
comforter? Why don’t you bring him in
and have done with it?
Warder : I’m waiting.
The Warder looks out and signals, then
opens the door and lets in the Clergyman, a
pallid, dejected man, in the shabby clerical
dress of one of the humbler religious sects.
The bell ceases tolling.
Clergyman (to Warder) : Would you mind
leaving us together? I may, perhaps....
Warder: Very well. I’ll be within hearing
(pointing off) if I’m wanted.
The Warder retires. The Clergyman waits
a moment or two before speaking.
Clergyman : They have told me you are
willing to see me. Can I help you in any
way?
Prisoner (curt again) : Help is beyond you
and all your class. I’ve told these people
that several times. (More considerately)
I’m obliged to you, but your services are
not required. Please understand that at
once.
Clergyman : They will not be pressed upon
you.
Prisoner: Thanks. (Waving a hand to-
wards the bench) Take a chair. I’m
afraid I can’t offer you any other hospi-
tality.
Clergyman (remaining standing and never
losing his gravity) : I am familiar with
your case. I witnessed your trial.
Prisoner: Then you really know’ nothing
about it.
Clergyman : The bare facts, anyway.
Prisoner : No; the facts were never laid
bare. You mean the facts given in
evidence?
Clergyman: May I recall them? You mur-
dered your wife, were convicted of it and
sentenced.
Prisoner (mildly correcting) : I killed her.
It was justifiable homicide.
Clergyman : But that plea was never set up.
Prisoner : Of course not. I couldn’t de-
cently have done so, and, if I had, no jury
could possibly have understood it.
Clergyman : Still, if it is understandable at
all the Executive Council w’ould consider
it in your favor, even now.
Prisoner : It would be beyond their compre-
hension, too. They would regard it as
an aggravation of my offence. Listen!
I’ll tell you why I killed her, and see if
you can understand. (The Clergyman sits
on the bench while the Prisoner harangues
him.) I am not the typical murderer. I
have come to this paradoxical, melancholy
pass because my whole life has been de-
voted—sacrificed, if you like the word
better—-to the joy and good things of a
life worth living.
Clergyman : The pursuit of pleasure, you
mean ?
Prisoner ( sharply) : Ido not! You fail to
understand me already. The things you
mean by pleasure, the coarse enjoyments
of eating and drinking, horseracing, loose
women and loose companionship, never
appealed to me. The things that took me
prisoner, body
and soul, were
those that make
intellectual, artis-
tic and cheerful
life the joy it is.
Clergyman : Art,
musi c, poetry
and so forth?
Prisoner: Partly,
but that doesn’t
express what I
mean. The com-
monplace ideals
of serious life-—-
ambition the
struggle for
place and power
—were nothing
to me. Though
I had to conform
to them, it
irked me un-
speakably. But
the bright, the
clever, the beau-
tiful, and, above
all, the humor-
ous thing en-
chanted me, in
whatever form;
whether as an
ingenious argu-
ment, a clever in-
vention, an ex-
alted verse, a
thrilling song, a
lean geste, the
apt word, a sixer
at cricket, a
ludicrous situa-
tion, or, at the lowest, a practical joke.
Clergyman : Forms of pleasure, all the
same, but pleasure with thrills.
Prisoner: That’s nearer it. When others
did these things well, I was filled with
admiration. When I could do them my-
self, I was thrilled. You know what it
means to get off the apt word, or a humor-
ous turn, at the right moment?
Clergyman : Yes; also what it means to
think of it too late.
Prisoner : Even that has its compensations.
You can lead up to it at another time. I
was not without talent, but I was the
despair of those who tried to train me to
the serious use of it. I was popular, had
influence behind me and every inducement
to undertake responsible things—was
pushed into them, in fact.
Clergyman : You could not have asked for
much more.
Prisoner : I didn’t ask for it at all. I dis-
liked. nothing so much as this unasked
pushing. You know what it is to a child
to be pushed into the water against its
will !
Clergyman : Unpleasant, perhaps; but only
another form of encouragement.
Prisoner : The encouragement was theirs—
the unpleasantness mine. I had neither
the ambition nor the taste for material
success and my friends tired at last of
their fruitless pushing. “Pity!” they would
say, “he might go far.” Par! (scornfully).
Up the slippery heights of chicanery, wire-
pulling and brassy self-assurance.
Clergyman ( impatiently ) : Oh, nonsense!
You exaggerate. You can’t succeed with-
out a certain amount of
Prisoner ( calm again) : Never mind. I
didn’t want to. There was nothing selfish
about my pleasures, anyway. 1 enjoyed
most the sharing of them with congenial
souls. You must see how essential to me
was a sympathetic mate —especially a fife
partner—but I married, of all women, a
dull, conventionally-minded one without a
trace of spirit or a spark of humor in her
whole composition.
Clergyman : But you deliberately chose your
own undoing.
Prisoner: Deliberately? No; I never did
anything like that. Say the recklessness
of impressionable youth—-the impulse of
thoughtless physical passion.
Clergyman : Naturally, it’s not easy for a
stranger to understand, but
Prisoner : Then I’ll illustrate it. She was
this sort of woman: If 1 argued with her,
however gently, she followed all the side
issues, false scents and illogical methods
of which the mind of woman is capable.
If I corrected her. however considerately
and clearly, she answered, “It’s the same
thing.” My own pet jests fell flatter than
the proverbial pancake. If they trenched
on delicate ground, as most of the best
jokes do, she declared I was coarse, or
varied it occasionally to “You needn’t be
vulgar” (the terms were interchangeable
with her, as they are with most women).
If I rallied and chaffed her, she thought
I was either childish or insulting. If 1
paid her a subtle compliment, I flattered;
and if I paid the same compliment to an-
other woman, I had a base motive and she
would be stupidly jealous.
Clergyman (impatiently) : Yes, yes, but all
that petty irritation is no reason
Prisoner : Wait! You haven’t heard the
worst. To crown everything she had the
deadly misgift of discovering sarcasm
where only a pleasantry was intended (a
failing common in dull people, but none the
less exasperating). I began to realise to
the full Schiller’s despairing cry, “Mit dtr
Dummheit kriegen die Gotter selbst ver-
gebens.” Do you understand German?
It means “Against stupidity the gods
themselves fight in vain.” It’s a terrible,
uncompromising truth.
Clergyman: But the dreadful climax? Is
it fair to ask how that came about?
Prisoner : She lived, as such women do, in
a world of irritating cliches. We had a
tiff —of no importance—and had made it
up. By way of finally banishing the un-
pleasantness, I made a little joke—a quaint
conceit—in the right tone and sentiment,
thinking it might appeal to her. In dead
seriousness, and with a touch of misplaced
irony, she asked, as she had asked a

know [?]n?”
OTHER : “Merely my magistrate, my dear.”
thousand times before, “Is that supposed
to be funny?” Then, in a paroxysm of
pardonable fury, I killed her. (A pause.)
Are you shocked? ( The Clergyman
makes a slight movement of his hands
to indicate “Does it matter if I am?”) I
suppose you are.
Clergyman : No. Your sincerity is obvious.
You confessed at once, and made no pre-
tence of accident, although that defence
was obviously open to you.
Prisoner ( waving the idea aside) : It was
over so quickly that I scarcely realised
what I had done, but even now I feel no
remorse, only an abounding pity for her
and those endowed like her. Thank God
we have no children to remember their
father as a murderer or inherit their
mother’s devastating humorlessness.
Clergyman : You may get a little consola-
tion from the reflection that if you were
set free you would have to suffer social
ostracism.

Prisoner : I know, but still, in spite of this
tragedy and its consequences....
Clergyman : I can understand that in your
case.
Prisoner ( with excited interest) : Can you?
Can you imagine that I would be willing
to remain on earth a social outcast?
Clergyman : Yes, I can. I remember an-
other line of your Schiller, though I can’t
give it to you in the original. In “Don
Carlos” the bright young spirit condemned
ro death laments his fate: “And yet, to
me, ah God! my life is still so sweet.”
Prisoner: Ah, then you realise now why
I find the prospect of death—death on the
scaffold —-so appalling, and why the well-
meant ministrations of gentlemen of your
cloth and your adjurations to make my
peace with my Maker, to be contrite and
be saved, only embitter the actual, horrible
brutality.
Clergyman : Remember, I have done nothing
of the kind yet.
Prisoner: I don't think I’ve given you the
chance.
Clergyman : When you do, I will not avail
myself of it—without your invitation.
Prisoner: Thanks. I believe I could tolerate
the prospect better if you got yourself up
as a jester and made cynical jokes at my
send-off.
Clergyman {protesting): Don’t!
Prisoner: It's my fate to see humor in most
things, except in being deprived of them
all in this shocking, abrupt way. I even
see some humor in you.
Clergyman {earnestly) : Then your insight
is indeed remarkable.
Prisoner: You don’t resent any imputation
of humor to your cloth?
Clergyman : Not in the least; especially
{with studied deliberation) as I am no
more a clergyman than you are.
Prisoner {astonished) : What? You are
not what you pretend to be?
Clergyman : No.
Prisoner : You have come here under false
pretences ?
Clergyman : Yes.
Prisoner: Well, I admire your cheek, any-
how. You are either a cynically humorous
dog, or you have another motive.
Clergyman : Let me explain this outfit, and
why I have come. Your story has in-
terested me. Perhaps mine may interest
you, if only as a study in contrasts. You
have been the favorite of Fortune, the
spoilt darling of society—-don’t interrupt
—I have been its neglected, helpless
straggler. So far from offering you sym-
pathy in what awaits you, I envy you.
Prisoner (startled) : What?
Clergyman : I do, sincerely. (He motions
the Prisoner to sit while he delivers him-
self.) I am a desperate man; not with
the desperation of the criminal, but the
true and worse despair begotten of a moral,
purposeful, industrious life. Can you com-
prehend that?
Prisoner: I’ll try. Go on, please.
Clergyman : What oppresses me to the sui-
cidal stage is defeat —hopeless defeat of
all my cherished aspirations and ideals.
As a young man I was fired with ambition
to succeed in my profession and to gather
all the prizes offered in public life.
Prisoner : Ah, the enthusiasms of youth!
Flaming to-day, abandoned to-morrow.
Clergyman : Nonsense ! Mine was not en-
thusiasm, but the serious, set purpose of
my life, never wavered in until —until
(He hesitates.)
Prisoner: Well, until?
Clergyman: Until now.
Prisoner: Why now?
Clergyman : I’ll tell you presently. In those
early days I used to be fond of talking
of my aspirations and achievements
aspirations with a capital “A” ana
A BUSINESS PROPOSITION.
“Hey, Billy, you tell old Brown that you'll tale the belting for
both of ns, and I’ll give you the water-melon I ’aren’t
eaten.”
achievements with a small one. I had
the usual encouraging advisers. “Plenty
of room at the top,” they would say. but
they did nothing to help me to get there.
Prisoner: And you found lions in the path?
Clergyman: It was not sloth that dis-
covered them. I found the way infested
with the beasts that wait to devour the
unknown and the timid.
ACCUMULATED A STOCK.
“Of course I'm fed-up. Here we've been married only three weeks, and Tom has started
scolding me already.”
“Patience , darling. Think how long he has been waiting for the chance.”
Prisoner : Oh, come! I always found that
they would eat out of my hand.
Clergyman languished): That’s the in-
iquity of it—the personal equation—the
eternal patronage and advancement of the
nice-mannered and personally agreeable
and the neglect of the unattractive talented.
Well for you. but ( lie stops suddenly,
and adds with a- wan smile) but I think
I owe you an apology now.
Prisoner ( airily ) : Don’t mention it.
Clergyman : You see, I was not endowed
with the graces that sit so lightly on you.
Prisoner : Yes. that’s a little more tactful.
Clergyman : I had no influence —through
family or friends. Worse still, I was
cursed with a deferential manner and too
ready a submission to any other point of
view, if it seemed right and reasonable.
Prisoner: Frankness and honesty. Very
good qualities to have.
Clergyman ( with decision) : Very bad ones,
sir, for the ambitious man. Those things
that count so materially towards advance-
ment —assurance to the advocate —bedside
manner to the. physician—suavity and
bluff to the politician, were somehow want-
ing in me.
Prisoner: You
lacked guts.
Clergyman : Not
so much that as
other analogous
things hide,
cheek and nerve.
Society and my
own nature con-
spired to defeat
me. I found I
could be only
the clever drudge,
who devilled for
others with less
intelligence and
more effrontery.
My soul revolted
against the igno-
minious slavery.
Failure at my
profession drove
me into com-
merce, only to be
disastrously rook-
ed by the first
sharp who came
along.
Prisoner : You
were looking for
trouble.
Clergyman : Well,
it’s tbe only thing
I have been able
to find easily.
Nothing fails
like failure, and
to be branded a
Failure (with a
capital “F”) is
the most deadly
mark for a strug-
gling man to
bear. I always
had to get past
that barrier: “Are
you the man who failed in business?” or
the other “Didn’t you once practise law or
medicine?” A new teri'or was added w r hen
I found myself slipping into middle-age.
No one has any use for the middle-aged
failure. I did not fling away ambition;
it died slowly and painfully.
Prisoner : And in matters of—sentiment—
was your luck the same?
Clergyman ( nodding ) : The woman I would
like to have married married someone
else while I was giving her the considera-
tion she asked for. When she begged for
time to consider my proposal, I conceded
it. The only result of my deference to her
wdshes was that a rival with less com-
punction and more assurance carried her
off in the meantime.
Prisoner ( seeing the grim humor of it) :
Like Young Lochinvar coming out of the
west.
Clergyman : On the top of these afflictions,
I am cursed with a physical one—no need
to particularise—a disease, slow and cer-
tain. Comforting physicians assure me
that “with care” I may live many years
yet.
Prisoner: I hope you may. On physical
appearances it seems reasonable enough.
Clergyman :As though I wanted to! If I
attempt (as I have done) to court earlier
death by sheer recklessness and excess,
the whole medical faculty seems to get
to work promptly to keep me alive, by
all the palliatives and artifices known to
the pharmacopoeia. But that I lack the
courage of the felo do so, I would, long
ago, have ended this history of misery by
my own hands. But I haven’t the
strength of purpose. In this respect guts
as you tersely put it, is the great quality
I need.
Prisoner : But surely.... It’s done every
day... .the means are so easy.. ..
Clergyman : Can you picture vourself do-
ing it?
Prisoner ( shortly) : No.
Clergyman: So I thought. (Drily) We
seem to have something in common after
all.
Prisoner: By George! If we could have
had everything in common! If you and
I could somehow have combined our lives
what could we not have achieved! Your
ambition and my opportunities!
Clergyman : Your wit and charm of manner
and my industry!
Prisoner: Your serious capacity and my
social influence —we could have moved
mountains.!
Clergyman : The speculation is profitless—
that’s the irony of it.
Prisoner ( after a pause) : This seems a
strange reason for visiting a condemned
felon. Was it your idea of consolation?
Clergyman : No, but I felt curious to see
how a man with your great vitality and
abounding humor would face the tragic
issue that daunted me. I remember that
even in your address to the jury you made
a joke—an ill-timed one I thought, and it
told against you—but you couldn’t resist
it. I imagined you going forth to your
doom with a jaunty step and a jest on
your lips.
Prisoner: You were wrong, you see. They
have even studied my want of nerve by
providing that bandage for my eyes. I
am permitted to w r ear it from here to the
scaffold and until (He ends with a
gesture.)
Clergyman: I thought that if a man could
face the death of a felon, as I pictured
you doing it, what an inspiration it would
be to me! What an example to bravely
follow!
Prisoner (coldly) : I was never quoted as
an example to anyone, I’m thankful to
say. But why this get-up of yours, if
you are not a clergyman?
Clergyman : It was my only way of getting
access to you.
Prisoner : Congratulations on your success,
but I’m sorry you’re disappointed. I’m
afraid you must add this visit to your
list of defeats and failures.
Clergyman ( looking steadily at him) ; I’m
not so sure. Something has just struck
me.... There might be a fruitful result
. ... ( Very deliberately ) Have you
noticed that we bear a considerable resem-
blance to one another?
Prisoner ( the purport of it slowly dawning
on him) : Well? Well? What of it?
Clergyman : But do we? Just superficially?
Prisoner: Perhaps. I suppose so (impati-
ently). Well, what of it?
Clergyman (coming closer) : Suppose that
resemblance could deceive others, would
you be willing to change places with me—
here—now ?
Prisoner : Oh. you’re mad! It’s beyond
practical possibility.
Clergyman : I mean it in all seriousness.
If we are to agree about it there’s no
time to waste.
Prisoner : I wouldn't accept the sacrifice
in any case. That settles it.
Clergyman : I tell you there’s no sacrifice.
Haven’t I said that I envy you your
prospect? You are eager to live. I am
anxious to die.
Prisoner : The idea is—is ridiculous. How
could we possibly impose upon these gaol
people?
Clergyman : It’s worth a trial, anyhow.
Have no fear of one thing, if we can
keep up the imposture until that fatal
trap falls with me, you will be fairly safe.
No gaoler would be likely to admit a
mistake like that, any more than a surgeon
would admit having removed the wrong
organ.
Prisoner (in the torture of indecision) :
How—how would you go about it?
Clergyman : We must change clothes here—
at once. When the Warder returns, you
go out as me—your services are not
wanted. I will blindfold myself with this
(picking up the bandage) and cover my
face. You keep yours averted from the
Warder. Come! Decide quickly.
Prisoner (still wavering) : You are very
persistent.
Clergyman : It is I that am developing the
forceful side of my character. But we
are wasting precious time. Is it a bar-
gain? (The Prisoner looks at him steadily,
then takes his hand.) To work, then!
Out of those clothes and into mine.
They begin to remove their clothes. The
stage is darkened while this operation goes
on. When the lights go up again they are
seen dressed in one another’s clothing.
Clergyman (smart and businesslike) :
Now, then. I sit here as if in profound de-
jection. You call the Warder, and remem-
ber to keep your face away from his. Now
for that black bandage.
Prisoner (suddenly) : I say, hasn’t this
been done before?
Clergyman : Only by melodramatic fools
suffering from an exaggerated sense of
heroic self-sacrifice. That isn’t our case.
(Picking up the Bible and handing it to
the Prisoner.) Keep this open, as if you
had been reading it to me. Quick with
that bandage. Tie it at the back of my
head. (The Prisoner does so, and the
Clergyman pulls it partly over his face.)
Don’t talk any more than you can help,
and get away as soon as you decently can.
(Footsteps are heard in the corridor.)
Hst! Here he comes now.
They assume the appointed positions. The
Governor and Warder appear at the door
and enter.
Warder: The Governor, with a message for
you, Prisoner.
WILL-POWER.
“Well, I’m surprised at his success! I didn't
think he had any will of his own.”
“He hasn’t. Rut he had his uncle’s, and that
teas worth thirty thousand.”
The Prisoner and the Clergyman do not
rise or change their positions, hut officialdom
does not insist upon it this time.
Governor : Prisoner, I am the bearer of
good news. The Executive Council has
reconsidered your .case and granted a re-
prieve.
Prisoner (turning suddenly, forgetful of his
role) : Reprieve? What —free?
Governor : Oh. no! (Indicating the sup-
posed prisoner) He could hardly expect
that. The sentence is commuted to impri-
sonment for life.
Clergyman (tearing off the bandage and
clasping his hands in despair) : My God !
Defeated again! Cheated even of death !
Prisoner (bursting into a peal of laughter) :
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! How droll!
His merriment and the astonished looks
of the Governor and Warder are cut short
by the fall of the curtain.

Some Women and a Rotter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
doubt we could get it—and lie then went
on to say that even if I had what we
thought convincing proof he could blow our
case out like a match. Then he winked at me
-—probably the effect of my generosity in
drinks —and said. ‘Look here, Clitheroe, a
man can’t commit adultery with his wife,
can lie?’ I couldn’t for the moment make
sense of it —could you? Then he went on:
‘You have brought me here to talk about
my private affairs—even threatened divorce.
That may be a professional matter, but
I’m not your client. If I tell you the facts
-—and, in confidence, I have no objection to
do so, as it may possibly save you and my
wife some trouble —it must be on the pledge
of your honor not to use them against me
in any legal process.’ I agreed provided that
you also, under the same undertaking, could
be apprised of what he stated.”
“It won’t pass my lips, John.’’
“Now this is what he told me. In 1897.
when living in London, he married a woman
whom he referred to as Emily. They seem
to have been an unhappily mated pair. She
was handsome but passionate, self-willed and
subject to prolonged fits of moroseness.
Twice she left him, but subsequently they
were reconciled. They had no children, and
in 1900, in one of her recurrent fits, she
left him for the third time. On that occa-
sion he took no steps to bridge the gap
between them. They went separate ways.
She had from her father’s estate a small
annuity barely sufficient to maintain her,
and he was doing a bit in what he called
‘outside brokerage.’ For five years he heard
nothing of or from her, though she could
have ascertained his address.
“On a vacation trip he met Mary Stevens
—as she then was. He was apparently, in
those youthful days, a type of man attractive
to women. They were engaged, and married
a few months later. The same year they
came to Sydney, where Mary had been
born, and early in the following year she
had a daughter. They were very comfort-
ably fixed, if not wealthy, as Mrs. Barstow
had then come into her slice of the family
“ l RANG you up three times.”
“I was in court all the morning,
then lunch; but now I’ve half an
hour.”
John Clitheroe filled a pipe leisurely
before shaking himself comfortably into his
chair. His much younger brother George,
seated on the opposite side of the writing-
table, was the working-partner of the firm
of Gellatly and Clitheroe, solicitors; the
senior member had been invalided for some
years past. He was master of all the detail
of a large and long-established business.
Should any difficulty present unusual feat-
ures lie came to John for consultation, the
elder brother, after many years striving,
being established in a lucrative practice at
the Bar.
“About ten o’clock this morning,” said
George, “Mrs. Barstow called at the office.”
“Was Dorrie with her?” He used the
familiar shortened name of Dorothea Bar-
stow, his brother’s fiancee.
“Oh no. You see the trouble is about her
father. It didn’t surprise me, for I can’t
say I like the fellow.”
“BarstoW plays a good game of golf,”
interjected John. “Don’t know anything
else about him.”
“For the past two or three months lie’s
been very erratic in his movements. You
know, they don’t run too well in harness,
and lately lie’s been getting a bit over the
odds. The mater —as she will be soon —
got a bit ratty over it. Too many week-ends
fishing and motoring, with late nights at his
club —bridge, poker and the rest of it. The
usual put-up stuff. Then some old cats
threw out hints served up with the usual
sauces. Finally the two had a scene. He
denied any woman and tried to bluff it off.
The mater is shrewd enough in her way, and
got an obliging friend to do a little amateur
detective work. The upshot is that she has
enough information to satisfy her that there
is a woman in the case. She let Barstow
know and asked him to give up this woman,
if not for her sake at least for Dorrie’s, and
so avoid a scandal. Of course Dorrie knows
nothing, but her mother a
divorce if Barstow is not amenable. She
told him so.”
“Well, what did he say?”
“Oh, took it without turning a hair. Said
in effect that she could do as she bally well
pleased. So that’s how it stands.”
“Couldn’t she put the screw on? He
hasn’t a penny to his name, has he?”
“Very little of his own. The mater, who
has a better head for bridge than business,
years ago left her affairs practically in his
hands. Even authorised her bank to accept
his signature to cheques.”
“Well, she’d better cancel it; probably
her money is keeping up the second estab-
lishment.”
“You often see Barstow on the links.
Couldn’t you contrive a talk with him?—
this is the mater’s suggestion. She’s deter-
mined to have a divorce if he doesn’t cut out-
the woman at once, and she wants you, as a
friend of the family, to impress that on him
—thinks it would come with more force
if he knew you were behind her. He must
see that if she succeeds it means boot-uppers
for him; and she will only hold her hand to
save publicity and mud.”
“I’ll try. George, but it’s a dashed un-
pleasant job. Lays one open to a straight-
out snub, of course.”
A week later, George Clitheroe was called
to the ’phone by John, who fixed noon to see
him at the latter’s chambers.
“Well, I inveigled BarstoAV here after a
diplomatic luncheon at the club-rooms,” he
said, picking up the story. “Having got him
I opened out in the role of the family friend
and in vieAV of your approaching marriage to
his daughter. I asked him what he pro-
posed to do; said the publicity of divorce
proceedings would be hateful to all con-
cerned on our side, but they would have to
go on if he didn’t quit the woman at once.
The rotter was sitting opposite to me, just
as you are, a cigarette in his month and as
cool as a cucumber. He drew a long whiff
from the fag, threw it away and remarked
almost cheerfully: ‘My dear Clitheroe. you
can’t do it. Where’s your proof of adultery,
to start with?’ I told him we had ample
proof—a bit of bluff, by the way, but no

property. All went well till a few months
ago. Barstow seems to have managed his
wife’s affairs with some success —though
she never made any settlement on him.
One day he was in a tram when he noticed
a woman, seated opposite, staring at him
very intently. Her face was in some way
familiar, but he could not at the moment
place it. He left the tram. She followed
and on the footway drew abreast of him and
touching his arm, said, ‘Ned, don’t you know
me?’ Then it came to him in a flash —she
was his wife, Emily.
“They crossed the roadway into Hyde
Park and walked together. About half an
hour later they parted, to meet afterwards
and renew their broken marital life. ‘The
position, as it seems to me.’ said the Rotter,
‘is this: If my second wife —to call her so
■ —goes on with the divorce she will come up
against the bigamy. That’s Emily’s threat,
not mine. Then on conviction and sentence
Mary will be left neither wife nor widow
and Dorrie will be the child of an illegitimate
marriage. There is a name for such a child.
So Mary, if she goes on with her divorce, will
drive a knife into her own heart and into
Dome’s. You can picture for yourself the
headings in the evening newspapers and their
snapshots. Not too pleasant, is it?’ ”
“Well —I —l’m damned !” ejaculated
George, choking with indignation.
“That’s how it stands —just where he left
it. The question is, What are we going to
(Jo?”
George first broke silence. _ “The only thing
that suggests itself to me is to buy off the
woman—if she is to be bought.”
“Who's going to do it? What’s the
woman’s position ?”
"Not too well off, I should say. Came
out as a nurse to some children. Perhaps
she had information —that I don't know.
At present she seems to be kept by him.”
“Well, I must be off," said John rising
hurriedly and taking his gown from its peg.
"Think it over and let me know.”
A week later, about 4.30, as the afternoon
light of a winter day was waning, John
Clitheroe switched on the shaded lamp at
his table and started to read-up a report
he needed for reference the following
morning. Tommy, the boy in whose miscel-
laneous services he had a fifth share, inter-
rupted him to announce that a lady was
waiting to see him. She had not sent in a
card or given a name.
"What does she look like, Tommy?" The
boy had been well primed not to admit
philanthropic beggars of either sex.
“Don't look like a orspital lady—just
or’nary lady.”
“Oh, well, send her in.”
Tommy opened the door and she entered.
John rose and placed a chair. The shaded
light gave him but a blurred impression of
a face that suggested pugnacity rather than
amiability, the face of one who could hold
her own—yet with a certain pathetic wist-
fulness about it.
“Mr. Barstow has spoken to me of an
interview lie recently had with you,” she
said, taking the proffered chair.
“Oh yes, we are well acquainted—his
daughter is my brother’s fiancee.”
“So I understand; and that, I suppose,
accounts for your interest in our affairs?”
“In his, certainly.”
The situation was strained. The visitor,
however, quickly relieved it. "I wish to
speak to you in confidence, if I may?”
“Anything you wish to say will be between
ourselves—and, of course, my brother, who
is equally concerned.”
“So Mr. Barstow said. I suppose lie told
you the whole story?”
“Well, he told me what he thought lit,
whether the whole or not I can’t, of course,
say.”
To this she made no reply and a brief
silence followed; then clearly and emphati-
cally came the words: “You want to get
rid of me.”
“That’s rather an abrupt way of putting
it. But you see the position is”
“Yes, I see all that. But have you thought
of me—my position ?”
“That, too, is difficult.”
“Look, Mr. Clitheroe,” and she put her
elbow on the table, resting her cheek against
the upraised hand, her eyes staring straight
into his. “I am not a girl and am past
romance. All that ended long ago. But I
am a woman, and in my own way I want
the rights I am entitled to —what the law
gives me. I am not so old that I should be
a passionless clod, or a piece of marble,
Mr. Clitheroe. I’m—l’m just a human being,
a woman.”
John nodded his head gravely; all situa-
tions cannot be covered by words.
“We never had a child, though I dearly
wanted one. She has what should have been
given to me if —if—if God had played fair.
Now she wants him too, all to herself, though
he’s mine, not hers. Even if we didn’t always
pull together, still wrn —we belonged. You
understand ! It wasn’t so deadly lonely then
as it has been since—and I can’t stand it
for ever. One grows older, and even quarrel-
ling—well, even that’s a sort of company. It’s
better than to belong to no one, to have
no earthly soul belonging to you. I wonder
I wonder if you understand what it means
—means to a woman. Why should she
have my man —and the girl, too, that ought
to have been mine? Don’t you see how one-
sided it is, Mr Clitheroe: and she has money
too, and friends. My God, has she a right
to have everything, and me —nothing!” and
for a moment passion flared into her face.
"Yet, you don't care so long as you can save
her and her girl.”
“But you must see what will happen
if the facts come out and Barstow is con-
victed and imprisoned—what becomes of
you ?”
“What’s a year, perhaps, and it may not
be half that. I can wait; he'll still be mine.
She can’t get him ; there’s the girl—that’s
her share.”
Clitheroe stared at the printed pages
before him, searching desperately for some
solution to this problem of two women and a
rotter.
She rose. “I just thought you ought to
see the other side —my side, that’s why I
came.”
"Yes. there’s your side and hers. What
about his? Is lie man enough to stick by
you—cut his easy life and share your poverty ?
Will he leave the country if, say, some
financial arrangement can be made? Couldn’t
it be fixed up some way? What good can
it do you to ruin two absolutely innocent
lives? Then, later on, a divorce can be
arranged quietly, just as if no previous
marriage existed. You have only thought of
yourself; couldn’t you give a little thought,
a little sympathy to this young girl just
on the eve of marriage? It is no fault
of hers nor of her mother that she should
be branded as illegitimate and be the
butt of spiteful tongues. Think it over.”
He opened the door for her. “After all, it
doesn't pay really to be cruel, does it?”
She went out into the dimly-lit passage-
way. A lonely figure, it struck him. Per-
haps there was something in belonging to
someone, and someone belonging to you.
Three days later Clitheroe, turning over
his morning’s correspondence, came upon a
letter addressed to him in the angular char-
acters of a departed school, lie opened it
with a sense of curiosity and read: —
Dear Mr. Clitheroe, —You may remember what you
said when I left that afternoon. I’ve been thinking
it over, trying to put myself in the girl’s place, if
you can understand, for I don’t want to be cruel, if
1 was sure, for some girls mightn’t care. If I was
sure, it might make a difference. Couldn’t I find
out for myself what she’d really think. I don’t
know that I ought to give up everything, though it
isn’t money I’m thinking of.
It was signed “Emily Barstow” and gave
as address the G.P.O.
“One damn problem after another! mut-
tered Clitheroe. Then he lit his pipe, the con-
soler, the fount of wisdom, and with hands
clasped behind his head stared at the yellow
ceiling. In a corner a spider scuttled across
its web to seize an entangled fly. llis face
wrinkled —wasn’t life just one big cobweb?
Then his thoughts turned inward. Yes,
perhaps it could be done. lie scribbled a
note: “I shall be free to-morrow afternoon;
call here at three o’clock,” and, addressing it,
handed it to Tommy for the post.
A few minutes later he rang up George.
“Could you arrange with Dorrie to call here
at 3.30 to-morrow afternoon? I. want to see
her about the mater’s settlement on her
marriage. Oh no, I just want her to under-
stand. What? Yes, of course. Get her to
come sharp on time.”
At three o’clock the following afternoon,
Tommy again ushered in the or’nary lady.
“It’s very good of you, Mr. Clitheroe, to
bother about me. Perhaps I oughtn’t to
have worried you with my note. I suppose
you think me—funny?”
“Not at all. I don’t pretend to under-
stand ladies —lawyers never do, and I’m a
bachelor, too. Now, let’s get to business.
You want to know what Miss Dorrie thinks
about it. Perhaps we can fix that up. This
door behind my chair opens into a sort
of lumber-room where I stow old papers
It is very dusty and rather dark. I’ve
arranged for Miss Dorrie to call here in-
yes. about ten minutes. If you will sit
very quietly in that room, I’ll leave the door
a bit open so that you can hear all she says.
I’ll put her chair on this side. You can’t
see her, but when she leaves you can watch
her from my window as she goes into the
street.
She consented, and when Dorrie entered,
the chambers were apparently unoccupied
save bv Clitheroe.
“Well, Dorrie, sorry to worry you over
legal affairs, but I want to have everything
straight before your marriage—not long to
wait now, eh? Now about the mater. She
wants to settle something on you that will
give you a little independence —-that’s what
women like nowadays, isn’t it?” Then he
plunged into the middle of affairs. His sug-
gestions were brief and to the point and had
her assent. Punning his fingers through some
papers, he picked up one.
“No, that’s not it! But —why, Dorrie
you might give me a woman’s view about a
little matter involved here—l think I can
recall the facts. What do you think of this?
A woman, middle aged, but still attractive
and still loving what life can give, is. so
placed that she can, by doing a certain thing,
ensure her own ends —getting something out
of life she didn’t get in her youth, but
wanted; say some sort of companionship.
To do it she may risk the happiness of a very
much younger woman —a girl, in fact—by
casting a slur upon her name and on the
name of her mother. .Tust when life is open-
ing out to this girl. That will hit her hard.
I feel for the two of them and I don’t know
what to advise. What would you do if you
were that woman? Do you think she ought
to grasp at what she considers the little
left to her at the price of the girl's happiness?
She would be quite within her rights in
doing it.”
Dorrie’s young face grew sober. lhen
over it came a 100k —a light, a suffused radi-
ance ; a something hard to fit with words.
“I think,” she said slowly—“I think —that
if x’d lost what my own youth should have
given, I’d try—though it would be very
hard, very hard indeed —I’d try to just make
the best of what was left without hurting
the other woman—in the way you say. You
see. John, you couldn’t spoil another life like
that and really regain your happiness. It
would be always coming back like like a
sort of ghost. Now could you?” .
“Mv dear, that’s sheer sentiment, lhis
woman has rights. The law gives them to
her. and. like us. she’s human.”
“Yes. John. I know; but. being a woman
she might think other things counted more—
things like —like — TV hat s that.
“What?”
“I thought I heard a noise. It sounded
like”

“Well, what?"
“Like a sob, John, though it couldn't be.'’
“No, my dear, how could it? I suppose
it’s Tommy sniffling outside —he sniffles from
May to October. Now, my learned counsel-
lor, off you go, and —thank you for a woman’s
help.”
As Tommy closed one door, Clitheroe
opened another. He led Emily to the win-
dow\ She saw the young figure come out of
the shadow of the building into the light,
graceful, dainty, sweet as a tail-stalked flower
lifting its pure face to the sun. It was
youth.
“Mr. Clitheroe, could you arrange for my
passage to England?”
“Alone?”
"Yes.”
“Of course I could, and. more
“I want nothing more, but I can’t pay the
passage money. I haven’t got it. And soon,
please.”
She moved towards the door. As they
reached it John took her hand.
“Will you pardon me?” and he raised it to
his lips. “Just to remind me-what we for-
get these days—there is still the fire of
•sacrifice in women.” And he bent as she
passed through into the empty corridor.
T. B. CLEGG.
The Big Chance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MIND you, this is plain fact. I haven’t
the headpiece to make it up as I go.
I can just tell you what happened
and the way it happened.
Kid Slater was his name —not his real
name, of course, but the one he fought under.
I was running a bit of a stoush
emporium at that time, being out
of the game since Mat Malloy gave
me the sleeping-draught at the
Sports Club. I had a few pounds
and a cauliflower-ear to retire on.
With my few pounds I rented a
basement, and started a young
gent.’s school of physical culture.
The ear passed for a sort of deco-
ration.
The most of the boys I got were
dainty goods. They wanted _to
learn the business without getting
hurt. I had my own little way of
dealing with them. I used to give
them about a week’s gentle treat-
ment, and then a ding-dong rougli-
up to try ’em out. It wasn’t policy,
I know. It cost me pupils, but I
couldn’t help it. One of ’em says
to me one night; “Stop, stop!
Don’t hit so hard! I didn’t come
here to be disfigured.” “Well, lad,”
says I, “this ain’t a beauty-parlor.
I undertake to teach you young-
chaps how to use your natural
armaments.” “Yes,” he says, “and
to give your own a bit of easy
practice.”
The first week Kid Slater floated
in I knew I had a different quality
in hand, but it was only by an acci-
dent I really found him out. He
was a quiet, gentlemanly chap, and
was studying the law at the time.
He sparred rather neatly, and said
he’d done a bit of it with his
father. It seemed his father had
been an amateur champ, in his
day.
At the end of a week, as per, I
set out to try him. “We’ll liven
the pace a bit to-night,” I says.
“Right,” he answers.
We went about half a round, so
far as I can remember. When I
woke up I was in hospital, spitting
blood, and with a nasty pain in
my side. There were three ribs
broken and a slight concussion
where I struck the floor. That was
the accident.
He came to see me that after-
noon, and you never saw T a man so
apologetic.
“Old man,” he says, “I'm awfully
sorry. I don’t know how I came
to do it.”
“Anyway,” says I, “you done it
whether you came to do it or not.
But let me know early next time.
I'm getting a bit old, and I don’t
wake up as quick as I used to.”
“There’ll be no next time,’’says he.
“Oh, yes there will,” I says: “I’ve ,got to
square this off with you yet. But there’s no
doubt, lad, you can use ’em. It’s an instinct
with you, that’s what it is.”
I told him not to woi’ry about me, as I
was wanting a spell, anyway. But he was
too cut up about it to drop it. “Is there
anything I can do for you,” he asks. “I’ll
do anything in my power.”
It was then my great idea came—or,
rather, I should say, it was then I saw the
chance of working on it, for I'd been think-
ing it over since I woke up.
“Lad,” I says, “there is. But we won't
discuss it now. Just bring me a packet of
smokes the next time you come and that’ll
see me through for the present.”
He used to call every day while I was in
the hospital, and when I got about and went
home he dropped in pretty regular.
One night he says, “Berry, what’s that
you were going to get me to do for you?”
I takes a pull at my pipe, and looks him
over. He was a fine build of a young chap,
with a good, pointed, fighting chin.
“It’s just a plain business proposition.
Money for you and money for me,” I says.
He looks interested.
“It’s this way,” I goes on, “I’ve got (he
knowledge, you’ve got the gift. Combine
’em and we’re made.”
It had him puzzled.
“Well, to get right there.” I says, “I want
you to, go into the fight business, and I’ll
teach you and train you.”
“But Berry, old chap,” he laughs, “you’re
not serious, are you?”
“As serious as a church convention,” I
says.
“But why?”
“Well, you’re a born fighter, and it’s ehe.at-
ing nature if you don’t take it up. You’ve
sot a left and you've got a right, and I
reckon the man who invented threshing-
machines saw you sparring.”
Well, we sat and we argued. At first he
was dead against it, but I put it to him
in every light I could think of. and at
last he wavered. Then he said: “I’ll think
it over, Berry.”
A week later he was learning how to
skip, and what to do with a punch-bag, and
how to handle the bells. Very little teach-
ing he wanted. He had the instinct.
But the interesting part was the ring
work. I started him off at ABC, the same
as I would any mug. I was set on making
him a thorough artist. I showed him how
to manage his feet, and how to place a
straight left. It was what he called “elemen-
tary,” but I kept him at it. And all the
time I was building up his condition. That
was the thing I was really anxious about.
I knew he was fit to tackle most people
with his hands almost as soon as I liked
to ask him. That was his gift. But the
other, the staying-power, had to be made, and
work was the only thing to make it. This
is where most mugs go wrong. But the Kid,
once he got properly into the game, devel-
oped an enthusiasm that was lovely to see.
Very soon I had to watch that he didn’t over-
work.
I began to build castles in the air.
About a month after I took the Kid in
hand the amateur tournaments came round.
I knew it was asking a lot of him, but I
reckoned it would be good experience. I
entered him in two weights, and he didn’t
seem to mind.
I won't tell you about those amateur con-
tests. It was just light exercise for the Kid.
He romped through like a pony bucking
through a mob of sheep. On the final night
he had two men to meet. He didn’t use
more than six hits between ’em. He had a
lullaby in each hand. The house got on its
hind legs and took him to its bosom. The
A ONE-MAN JOB.
DAD: “ ’Ow many cows did they milk at the last place you teas at?”
FARM HAND: “None. They left ’em all to me, like you’re doin'!”
Kid just smiled, and I sat back, one lung
wanting to shout and the other wanting to
swear. You see, I'd reckoned I had a good
thing all to myself. Now he’d shown him-
self I knew all the heads would be buzzing
round. I wasn’t standing behind much
silver. Could I hold him?
I said nothing, but waited and watched,
not feeling too confident.
Sure enough, in the next few weeks they
started coming about. The old rooms hadn’t
seen such gilded goods for a long time. They
wanted to see the Kid spar, and watch him
at work. Then they wanted to take him
out to dinner. I could see them coming at
it, though he, being new to the game, didn’t
seem fly to it.
It was an anxious time for me. The cage
door was open, and I could see my dicky-
bird about to wing it. Every time I was
alone with the Kid I expected him to break
the news. But he never said a word. At
last it was too much for me. I put it to
him straight: “Anything doing with these
sporting gentlemen?”
“How do you mean?” he asks, as though
he hadn’t expected me to come that way.
•‘Why,” I says, a bit shy; “any, business
doing? They’re generally talking money
to someone.”
“Oh,” the Kid laughs with that good grin of
his, “they did start taking a sort of per-
sonal intei-est in me. Had some nice ideas
of making a fortune for me. Very kind-
hearted chaps.”
I didn’t know if he was keeping me in sus-
pense on purpose. I waited a while, and
then, “Are you thinking of giving their
scheme a try?” I asks, trying to say it
the same as you would “Lovely weather.”
But the Kid must have caught something
in my tone that got there without permis-
sion. He turned to me with a serious look
on his face.
"Berry, old man, I've been a hog. I
should have told you. But I didn't think
you knew what was doing. Bfeats me how
you got wind.” (Innocent as a babe as he
was.) "They did make me an offer —I sup-
pose it was a good offer. In 'fact, I'm sup-
posed to be considering it still. But I told
’em ‘Nothing doing.’ I’m not out for a
banking-account. I would never have gone
into the game only you persuaded me, Berry.
Now, I’m here, I’m here for the sport of
the thing. It’s good to feel fit and strong
and able to use your ‘natural armaments,’
as you call them. That’s all I want. Any
money that comes my way I’ll take. I’m no
philanthropist. But I’m not leaving these
rooms for the most tempting offer in the
city.”
I could have pressed him to my shirt-
front then and there. I felt ashamed of
myself for ever having doubted him. From
that day on I looked on the Kid as a father
would a son. I'd got his full strength.
I knew he was the genuine article, right
through to the backbone. I said to myself,
“You’re made. You’ve got the greatest of
God’s creatures —an honest man w 7 ho can
fight.”
The next few months were all work.
There’s nothing to tell you of. We just
plugged away on the quiet and kept building,
building. Lord, what a physique lie had!
The way he spread out iu those months
was a poem. I used to bend over
him, as he lay on the table after a couple
of hours’ steady going, like a mother bend-
ing over her babe. I used to rub and pinch
and pat those muscles like a lover caressing
his sweetheart. It sounds a bit sloppy, but
that’s the way I got to look on that Kid.
And the Kid. I could see, looked on me
as his friend. We grew confidential with one
another. I told him what was worth telling
of my fighting days, and he told me about his
people. He'd got the fighting instinct from
his father. The old man had had him and
his brother sparring when they were nippers,
until they got to like it and were always at
it. Then the father died. Later the brother
went wrong in some way and cleared. So
the Ivid and his mother were on their own,
just living quiet and comfortable. He used
to often tell me about his mother, when we
were working together. He thought the
world of his mother, which was one of the
things I liked about him —that and his fight-
ing powers. So we worked together and
got to know one another.
And then came the climax to all this work.
There was a chap expected over from the
western side who carried a rather nice repu-
tation with him, and he was looking for
victims. I buzzed round and saw some of
the club men —the club had him under con-
tract. It took a bit of working, for, you
see, except for the Kid’s amateur perform-
ances, which were pretty well forgotten by
now, he was unknown. But I stood pi'etty
good with some of the inside men. They
knew I could pick a good thing, and at last
I fixed it.
“The conditions ain’t the best ever,” I
said to the Kid, “but he’s known and you’re
not. A win means you’re well paid for your
trouble in plain cash, but it means a lot
more. It means a settled income. You 11 be
picking your teeth with gold tie-pins yet.
I got some of the boys I knew to slip in
and give him a bit of variety. Some of them
were men who knew the business from A to A,
and he put it over all of them. I began to
collect my back debts. I wanted every' cent
I could rake in. A man don t get too many
big chances in a lifetime.
As for the Kid, I watched over him night
and day like a mother. Not that I didn’t
trust him. I’d have staked my life on his
honesty. But young fellows are sometimes a
bit foolish, particularly when they're feeling
warm with success and perfect condition.
I used to watch his good, open face, for
I knew’ his expression showed the condition
of his mind, and I knew his mind would tell
a tale on his body. I set myself out to
keep him happy, and pleased and satisfied.
I noticed every bit of a change in him. Lis
soon as he came in one afternoon I could
see he’d been thinking too much. That w r as
my business—to -watch him, and nurse that
thinking works of his. So I set to work at
once to probe him.
“Well, hop have you been thoroughly en-
joying yourdelf ?” I asks.
“Just theisame,” says he.
“Not a bad business, this living,” I
chips.
“No,” says he, but a bit uncertain.
“What’s happened to your lower lip?” I
laughs. “Trying to scratch your chin with
it? Don’t get taking too many liberties
with your personal appearance.”
“I’m a bitf worried, Berry, old man,” he
says at last.
“Well, I’m your father confessor,” I
answers. I was a bit anxious, but of course
my game was to do the hale and hearty.
“Got a letter last night from that brother
of mine,” he says. “You know —the chap I
told you of. Silly beggar. Always making
a mess of it. Married now. Couple of kids.
He’s been living up to it. as he always did.
One thing abotit him, lie’s frank. Now he’s
in a corner. Seems he’s got a sure chance for
a good rise in a week or two, but he don't
know how to live till then. He didn’t tell
me much of his affairs. He just wanted
twenty to see him through for the time be-
ing. When he gets this lift lie’s reckoning
on lie promises ito straighten up and take a
pull. I wouldn’t like the mater to
know lid’s down to it like that.”
“Well” I says, “if you’ve got
twenty to spare I suppose he’s got
it by now.”
“Yes,”; says the Kid.
“Well, that ends it. don’t it?
There’s nothing more for you to
worry about. You’re too serious-
minded.”
Just sd I occupied myself in those
days watching him, and keeping his
mind freci and cheerful.
I started in early placing my
money, and it was just as well. The
night of the event the market had
tightened a lot. Some of them had
got wind of the Kid’s class. But
I'd done pretty sound business, and
I didn’t mind the prices changing. It
would help to give the Kid confi-
dence.
You’ve Seen a fight or two your-
self, so I won’t bother you with too
much description. The Kid was a
bit pale as be sat in his corner. The
other chap—it was the first view I’d
got of him—didn’t have that easy air
I’d expected in a man with his reputa-
tion. But he looked the part. He
had the trade-mark ear, the bridge
of his nose was flattened in, and a
good few teeth were missing. They
said he could take a lot of punish-
ment, and lie looked like he’d been
doing it.
I didn’t have much to say to the
Kid. I’d schooled him in all the fine
points in the last few months. To
talk too much now would just dis-
turb him.
When he stripped to rise for the
shake a bursit of applause went up
at his physique. Apollo’s twin
brother, right enough.
They stepped to the centre and
shook, and it was then a nasty feel-
ing began to creep over me. There
was something in the Kid’s eyes I'd
never seen before. If I hadn’t known
him as I did I’d have called it the
yellow streak, I told myself I w r as
over-anxious.
The other chap fixed him with his
eyes as soon as their hands met and
stared at him hard and long. It
was a trick I’d seen worked on new-
chums before.
The first round was the poorest
show I’d ever seen. The man with
the reputation was as harmless as a
child. The Kid didn’t seem to know
his way about the ring.
“Now open out a bit,” I said, as
I shook the towel. “Not too far.
Just see his style.”
The next round I could see the Kid try-
ing to do something, but he didn’t seem able.
The other man improved a little, but not
much. The house began to murmur.
The third round opened like a thunder-
clap. The Kid moved right to work,
placed a couple of lovely hooks below the
heart, and then waltzed home with a sting-
ing left. My heart swelled up within me.
He had found himself. Now look for excite-
ment !
The western man justified his reputation
for taking punishment. He just shook his
head and bored in. He brought some
weapons to bear no one would have ex-
pected he bad in his armory.
And the Kid —well, I try to forget about
it. He got lost. His lovely defence stood
to him for a while, but he didn’t seem to
know how to hit. I could feel myself going
white. As they broke from a clinch he caught
my eye, and it must have been pretty wild-
looking. A pathetic expression came over his
face—and then he dropped to a right cross.
I dressed him, and I took him home in
silence. I couldn’t speak.
At his gate he turned to me. “Berry,” he
said quietly, “will you shake?”
“Nothing more certain,” I said.
T7e shook. There was one of those nasty,
empty silences. Then the Kid spoke, and
his voice had a bit of a tremble in it.
“Do you know what happened?” he asked.
“Well,” I said, “I kind of do and I kind
of don’t.”
“Berry.” he said, “I’ll never be able to
make it up to you. I had to do it on prin-
ciple. He’s my brother. It was the chance
he was building on.”
“Shake again.” I said.
But his damned princiole had broke me.

May Night.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SO late, so black! Poor humans creep
In walls to hide themselves with sleep
From the bare beauty of the frosty skies;
But out among the brakes and fingered
branches
Are happy paws and eyes,
Strange eyes that take the starshine in
And give it back, as all night’s kin,
Making the dark a twilight faintly pearled ;
Rabbit and bear and bat and furry possum
Reign in their own dim world.
Now floating up and drifting down,
Close always to the gum-trees’ crown,
Skimming their outline in a curve of grey,
A great owl stretches wide her scimitar
pinions
And slides unheard away.
Moths find thin honey overhead:
From the high stars is eerily shed
Sharp as fine rain the plovers’ prickling
cry;
A tiny treefrog warbles like a robin,
A wombat mumbles by.
Night wins from ferny rifts unseen
A praise of incense pure and keen.
From sassafras, from feathery (logwood
spray;
The ashen underleaves of musk and hazel
Smell richer than by day.
The ebon moments cold of wing
For multitudinous blossoming
A dust of finest water-seed bestrew,
That dawn may draw from trembling buds
of crystal
Miracle flowers of dew.
So late, so black! Yet all the bush
With chirp and dart and blunt-nosed push,
With stir of busy to-and-fro is rife;
The forest folk play in a sweet absorption
The rigorous game of life.
And even as terrific day
In flames of golden disarray
Brightens to glory of a heaven-wide birth,
Tin' little pink and white soft-fisted mush-
rooms
Reach up, and break the earth!

The Interloper.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT is natural for an ordinary bread-and-
butter-making man sometimes to wish to
be alone; and, more than that, to com-
plete his emancipation, he may toss the daily
paper, unopened, to the terriers on the lawn.
'Therefore, the desire for solitude has nothing
to do with scornful aloofness; and those who
look upon it as an affectation are, generally,
themselves the least independent people in
the world.
To be quite alone is to experience the
greatest possible freedom. A bachelor-bed
upon a verandah, with the sun streaming
through the interstices of a cane blind, be-
comes an ideal place for a cigarette. _ A o
watch the smoke, combed by latticed lights,
mount the cool darkness until it suddenly
reappears within the circle of a Jack-o’-
lanthorn, caused by the reflection of a spoon
left in a glass from the night before.
Here, hidden below blankets, we enjoy the
smell of pittosporum, and the hot summer
cry of Chanticleer, like the voice of the warm

Almost every
piece of furniture
lias some associa-
tion with the past;
and, while we take
our ambulatory
breakfast from the
margin of a round
table, the orna-
ments and the pictures begin to talk.
A sparkling face, photographed long ago,
sends a spray of fire across the heart as we
remember awkward kisses, the first to be
given outside of consanguinity’s barren
bounds. That this object of our affection is
still alive, and remains still pretty, helps us
a good deal on the way towards solitary con-
tentment.
Ah! Memory of happiness! Even the
watch, reposing upon a handkerchief, close
to the mantelpiece clock, sympathetically
stretches its hands, like a young crab newly
come into warm water.
This miniature of our grandfather, in a
green uniform, wearing mutton-chop whiskers
and “macassared” hair, reveals only too
plainly the source of our own most mascu-
line charm. Although you cannot see it in
the picture, we know his right arm to have

the odor of sun-baked tweed, floats about
him, almost vis-

when poetry was to be recited (and never
learnt any better), we prepare to listen-in.
But after the interloper had reached his
eighty-seventh verse, we dashed his manu-
script on to the floor.
“We do not like poetry!” we exclaimed.
“That’s a shameful confession!” he re-
plied.
‘‘Then you may go to the Devil!” we con-
tinued, and pushed him out of the house.
“Let me in ! Let me in!” he cried, beat-
ing with both fists upon the panels of granu-
lated glass.
“Never again during the whole of our
lives!” we answered.
“In the Name of the Thrush and the
Nightingale,” he continued, “I call upon you
to let me in !”
But we, relaxing no whit, told him at a
proper length—through the keyhole—liow

again took off our trousers and relapsed into
a solitude now rendered doubly charming on
account of this moment of unexpected
jeopardy.
H[?] MCCRAE.
The Eyes of the Children.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN they brought Macalister word
that there was a lady waiting for
him in the lounge, ho put down his
cue and pulled himself together, trying to
look the solemn, serious man of fifty lie
never really felt himself to be. All the
way down on the boat he had been dreading
this moment, and rehearsing it in private.
It was necessary to tell the w r oman some-
thing about Jim, and pump up a few fare-
well messages. Not a very easy business,
since he knew practically nothing about Jim’s
relations with his wife, except that they
had been unhappy ! For the last ten years
and more Jim had been living away from
her —at Cloncurry, the Towers, and later in
Papua, and not many people knew he was
married at all.
“She’ll weep on my shoulder and tell me
all her troubles,” thought Macalister, "and
I’ll have to fake up a sentimental picture of
poor old Jim dying with her name on his
lips.”
He had expected a slim, faded woman in
black, with a touch of hysteria in her
mobile face. The short, dark girl sitting
near a branching palm in the lounge with
her feet crossed and her trim body clothed
in the self-possession that goes with a tailor-
made costume took him by surprise. Yet
she was undoubtedly waiting for him. Her
frank, direct eyes flashed when he entered,
and she half rose.
“You’re not Jim’s wife?” he said awk-
wardly.
“No, I’m his daughter,” she told him.
“That’s near enough, isn’t it? I wanted to
have a talk with you before you came out
to the house. You were coming out, weren’t
you ?”
“That’s so.” he said, looking uneasily for
a "waiter. “Let’s have some tea together.”
He felt when he turned his back that she
was sizing him up, from the bald spot on his
crown to the elastic-sided boots he had
never got out of the habit of wearing, even
when he was in town. She was very alert
and precise, with the modernity of a genera-
tion of young girls he did not know. Cock-
tails anil cigarettes, he was speculating; no,
not quite that! But there was an embarrass-
ing absence of illusions in the brown, wide-
set eyes that, in other ways, were so like
Jim’s.
While the waiter was bringing tea, he
skirted round the subject of her father, try-
ing to find out how much she knew about
him. There was satisfaction in the thought
that Jim had left her comparatively well
off. His share of the deal they had pulled
off when they bought out the best leases on
the lambada’ field from Iteay and his party
would be somewhere near ten thousand._
“I only got down a day or two ago,” he
said. “1 dropped a note to your mother
straight away. Was it you wrote back say-
ing you’d call?”
She admitted that she had.
“Didn’t you guess I wanted to see you
first?" she asked. “I thought What sort
of a story were you going to tell Mother?”
There was a naive abruptness in the
question that made him laugh uneasily.
“I don’t know. There isn’t much to tell.
You’re not afraid of me inventing something
disgraceful, are you? I was your father’s
mate.”
“That’s just it,” she said quickly. “It’s
your business to pretend—all sorts of things.
There’s no point in that. Mum’s had a
rotten life.”
Macalister felt there was need to say
something on behalf of Jim.
“You’ve only heard one side of it, most
likely,” lie said. “Anyhow, it won’t make
it so bad for your mother if she feels he
thought about her in the end.”
“It’s only humbug,” said the girl emphati-
cally.
“H’m, you’re pretty downright, aren’t
you?” returned Macalister. “But what I
say’s true, all the same. He was conscious
a little while before the end, and lip asked
me to put things straight for the pair of
you.”
“After they’d been crooked for donkey s
years,” the girl rejoined. “It seems a bit
late in the day.”
There was a truculence in her voice that
shocked Macalister, but her eyes were open
and honest.
“How well did you know your father?”
he asked.
“As well as he’d let me,” she said. “He
was home once when I was about seven, and
again when I was nearly twelve. That w T as
tiie limit of his interest in either of us. But
I haven't anything particular against him
now. It's Mum's future I'm thinking about.
I don’t want her to believe a lot of rot.’’
“Rot?” repeated Maealister.
“You weren’t going to tell her it was the
drink killed him, were you?” she said drily.
“No,” said Maealister, “because it wasn’t
true. At least He had a cough on him
for the best part of a year. Where have
you been picking up this sort of informa-
tion ?”
She did not answer directly, but rattled
along: “If Mum believes he died thinking
about her, she’ll put a halo on him and stay
single till the cows come home. That’s the
sort she is. And she’s had a rotten time all
these years. It's only fair she should get
something out of life.”
“By marrying again?” queried Maealister.
“She’s only forty,” said the girl abruptly.
Looking at her balanced face with its wide
brows, Maealister wondered where she had
gathered so much wisdom and oommonsense.
She looked a little bit of a thing in her
rounded toque and short hair, more like
a boy than a woman. He could see her
point of view now, and realised that it was
justifiable enough. There was no bitterness
in her voice when she talked about Jim, but
neither was there any particular interest.
He was .just a vague shadow that had passed.
Maealister was without vanity, yet when
he looked into her open eyes he felt that she
was really more curious about him than
about her father.
“Do you want me to come out or not?”
he asked, as she rose to go.
“Dh, yes,” she replied warmly. “I’d love
you to. Only—you won’t try to play on
the soft pedal?”
lie assured her with a smile that he could
be as dry as a bleached bone when it was
necessary.
Doing back to the billiard-room, a little
fluttered by the encounter, Maealister ran
into Crawley, a young planter who had
come down with him on the boat. It flashed
upon him that Crawley had been watching
the pair of them with an amused grin across
the lounge.
“You old Lothario, Mac.,” came the greet-
ing, “where did you happen to pick up a
pretty girl like that?”
The fellow’s tone affected Maealister un-
pleasantly ; there was a satyr-like smirk
in it.
AT AN OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE.
“ Herbert , why are yon wearing your glasses
in ' bed ?”
“Well, my dear, I’m gating so terribly short-
sighted I can't recognise the people I
dream about.”
“Don’t you worry,” ho said. “Sho’s not
your sort, Crawley. She's the daughter of
iin old mate of mine.”
“Oh, Jim's daughter!” said Crawley, with
a comprehending shrug.
It was annoying to Macalister that all
the younger generation talked about Jim in
just that way. Yet he had been a first-class
assayer in his day, and had forgotten more
about mining than most of the experts ever
knew. It was not his fault that money had
a habit of slipping through his fingers, and
that he could never stay long enough on one
job. When he went out to Bulimba to see
the family, his chief aim must be to get hold
of Jim’s daughter and persuade her what a
good fellow her father had really been. An
obscure loyalty was beginning to work m
him. . , ~ ,
“If she’d really known him she d have
stuck to him like liis skin,” h.e told himself.
“She’s that sort. And poor old Jim it
would have given him balance to know lie d
a eirl like that.”
But in her mother’s sitting-room he did
not get much opportunity of talking alone
with the girl. She seemed determined to
divert his tongue from any dangerous topic,
and asked him eager questions about Ins
trip abroad and the countries he proposed
visiting. Jim’s wife was a little, nervy
woman, as lie had anticipated, with a
strained sentimentality in the very pose ol
her body and a face that looked white and
bloodless against her loose-hanging dark hair.
The girl teased her robustly about the books
she read, her fondness for cats and a dozen
other things, but she did not really brighten
up till there came a knock at the door, and
a tall, lean man, who looked like an under-
taker, was ushered in to fill the remaining
easy chair. , ,
“Il’m,” thought Macalister, watching the
way his eyes hovered about the woman on
the* lounge, “this is where she sheds pool
old Jim's name and memory.”
He was glad of an opportunity to go.
though he wanted to see more of the girl.
She came down wfitli him to the gate, where
the frangipanni left a heavy scent on the

air, and they stood for a while looking
down at the river. .
“Why are you going away l she quizzed
him. “Why don’t you marry and settle
down?” . <<T ,
“Too late ”he told her jocularly. I m
.till young enough to travel, though, and I’ve
J thored a bit of cash together for the first
Time. Ever since 1 could walk I’ve wanted
to have a wander-year.”
In suite of her independence she seemed
anxious to hang on to him. There, was a
childishness in the way she made him pro-
mise to send her exhaustive letters.
••I'll write to you —lots,” she assured him.
“ lust see if I don’t spread myself.”
' She was as good as her word. He was
i„ California, following up some of the lost
i rails of the ’forty-niners when her first let-

L her talk. The very sight of her large,
hashing script brought a clear vision of her
sittin--- at the window overlooking the river
~nd splashing the ink about in the way .Tim
used to do when his hands were steady
enough to hold the pen.
“You won’t drop when you hear that Mum s
going to get married again,” she wrote. “She
was trembling on the brink and I helped
to push her in, though I don t paiticulaily
like the man. Alberto, I call him. He runs
•i department in a wholesale warehouse, and
is a bit flat-footed, but he’s devoted all the
same, and Mum can stand a, lot of that.
You got a glimpse of him the night you were
110 Arid a little later when he had dropped
down the coast, to Ecuador to report on some
silver-workings for an American syndicate:
“They were fixed up quietly about a fort-
night ago and Alberto’s turning out a bon-
anza I won’t deny I’m glad to be on my
own for a while. Mum always lived on the
edge of her nerves, and I found that a bit
wearing. She’s getting some of the fat now
she ought to have had years ago, and it’s
brightening her up. When are you coming
hack?” , ,
There were other letters, more concerned
with her own adventures. She had bought
a fourth share in an eighteen-footer, and went
down the bay at week-ends with three other
girls. She was taking up the violin lessons
she had dropped years ago. In the sketchy,
inconsequent way of a girl she built up the
background of her life till it became more
real to Maealister than the scenes he moved
among daily. Once he was pulled up with
a jerk by a little postscript scrawled across
the corner of a letter :
“I met a man named Crawley the other
day. He says he knows you.”
That was all, but it filled jXlacalistei s
mind with speculations when her letters
began to peter out. There was no need to
worry about the future of Jim’s daughter,
though, he told himself. She was the sort
of young woman who was born with a
shrewd judgment and no illusions. He had
a lively expectation of looking her up when
he got back again, but one little venture led
to another, and before he knew it he had
formed loose ties and associations that kept
him tethered.
It was nearly five years before he drifted
back, by way of China and the Malay States.
As he' dropped off at Samarai to have a
look at the country where his first streak
of luck had come to him, he could not be-
lieve that he had been away for so long.
Five years! He had intended to be abroad
twelve months at the most, but then he had
never been able to plan anything ahead for
more than a few weeks at a time. Sitting
on the balcony of the hotel overlooking the
water with Gregson, a Resident Magistrate,
he went over the men he had known, yet it
was only when Crawley’s name was men-
tioned that he became really alert.
“Yon must remember him,” said Gregson.
“Me came here years ago as a youngster
and made a bit of money trading up the
Fly River. Poor devil! He was killed
three months ago in a car he’d borrowed —
SHAKSPEARE IN THE COW COUNTRY.
“She is mine own,
And I as rich in haring such a jewel
As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.”

smashed up completely. The woman with
him got off with a couple of broken ribs.”
“His wife?” asked Macalister quickly.
“No, not exactly,” returned Gregson drily.
“Some woman he’d been tracking around
with while her husband was away. His wife
did come up here for a few months a couple
ol years ago, but the climate didn’t suit her
little girl, so she went back. I don’t think
Crawley persuaded her very hard to stay.
He was the sort of fellow who always had
more than one iron in the fire.”
Macalister could believe that from what
he knew of him, and he was seized by a hor-
rible .suspicion that the woman Crawley had
married was Jim's daughter. Gregson could

give him no definite corroboration of that,
though. He remembered Jim. but was un-
aware that he had a daughter. The only
thing was that the description tallied well
enough.
“You could look her up when reach
Brisbane, anyway,” he suggested. “I can
get you her address. And she’ll be glad to
see anyone who knew Crawley.”
It came to Macalister as the boat slugged
its way down through the sleepy waters of
the Barrier that, if the girl Crawley had
married really was Jim’s daughter, he was
in for the most difficult encounter of his life.
What was he to say when faced with those
eyes that had looked at him so sceptically
when he tried to talk of Jim? He remem-
bered that interview in the lounge of the
hotel and the neat little figure in tailor-
made serge, bobbed hair and pointed shoes.
He remembered the queer emotion she had
roused in him. Why had he allowed her to
get out of touch with him for so long?
The question repeated itself in his mind
when, a couple of days after his landing, lie
made his way out along the river to Hamil-
ton. lie was in no doubt about whether she
had married Crawley now, for her letter had
satisfied him on that point.
“I’m looking forward desperately to seeing
you again,” she had written, “particularly as
you knew Phil. He thought such a lot of
you.”
It was the way
she referred to the
dead man that be-
wild e r e d Mac-
alistor, for there
was no hint of the
irony he expected.
Nothing to give
him a clue! She
was waiting for
him at the gate of
a trim bungalow
with a cropped
lawn; and when
she saw 7 him climb-
ing the hilly street
she called to the
• child on the grass
and came running
down to meet him.
Macalister was con-
fused. In spite of
the maturity of her
figure and the
slight droop at the
corners of her
mouth, she looked
younger and more
naive, and she wel-
comed him as if he
were some old
uncle she had
knowm as a child.
Almost before they
had entered the
door she had begun
talking of Crawdey,
and there was a
little tremolo in
her voice that re-
minded him of her
mother.
“You heard all about it up there?” she
said, looking at him. ...
“Just a little,” he admitted, feeling his
way. “I didn’t know Crawley very well.
And of course I hadn’t heard it was you.”
“He didn’t want you to hear.” she told
him, “he thought it would be a good joke
when you came home. It was horrid that we
had to live apart so much when we were
everything to one another, but he was
frightened of Alma’s health and mine. I
oughtn’t to have let him send us away—-I
ought to have stuck to it. But every day
he expected to get a chance of selling the
place —he was taking a buyer out when it
happened.”
Her jerky, troubled voice, running on and
on, made Macalister feel he was living in a
dream. He had an impulse to put his hand
on her shoulder and say: “There, there!
Don’t let’s talk any more about the fellow.
Both of us know he wasn’t any good, and
you hate humbug as much as I do. You
showed me that years ago when I was mak-
ing ready to pitch a tale about poor old Jim.”
But looking into her absorbed eyes he saw
that her emotion was real. The room was
full of memorials of Crawley; there was the
enlarged photograph over the piano and a
little miniature on the table
near the lounge. It occurred to
him for the first time that the
fellow was good-looking, in spite
of the way his mouth fell open
in a slightly sardonic grin. And
he managed to create an illu-
sion about himself in the mind
of this clear-eyed girl who was
so damnably hard on her father!
“Come and talk to Uncle
Mac.” said Jim’s daughter,
reaching out her arms to the
child who was playing with a
brown elephant on the rug. “He
was a friend of daddy's.”
“And of your grandfather’s,”
supplemented Macalistor.
The little girl hung back. “I
don't like daddy,” she said,
frowning darkly. “He forgot
my birthday. Mummie’s too.”
Macalistor coughed. Some-
thing in the frank, sceptical
eyes reminded him vividly of
the girl who had waited for him
over five years ago in the hotel
lounge. lie had an uncanny
sense of the processes of life re-
peating themselves endlessly
and the sanctities of one genera-
tion being pierced and torn
apart by the next. To cover
her confusion the woman took
the child on her knee and began
joking about Phil’s forgetful-
ness ; and he echoed her
mechanically:
“Yes, that’s so. Popular with
everyone. Men and women.”
But the image in his mind
was that of his old mate.
An undercurrent of emotion
was carrying him along, and the Jiin he had
wanted to reveal to his daughter years ago
came back vividly. He had forgotten time
and place, and was back again in the spinifox
country, camping by a muddy pothole. Gib-
bers and mountain-gums, and a man lying on
his elbow in the fireglow. telling yarns in a
slow, humorous drawl! What a charm there
was about him. even when he was down at
heel and drinking!
Seeing the woman’s eyes upon him, Mac-
alister brought himself back with a jerk.
“Popular with everyone,” he repeated with
a sudden emphasis, “I wish you’d been able
to be more with him. He was the best mate
a man ever had.”
VANCE PALMER.
The Winning Post.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OF the riders I knew—-and I’ve been with
a lot —
There never was equal of Lanky Ilar-
nott.
On the Murray side there was no one like
■ him
Except his own brother —his twin-brother
.Tim.
When they rode through the timber o’er
log or boulder.
Bronzed were they both and broad of
shoulder,
Belted tight round a slender waist.
With eagle vision and viking-faced.
Such are the men with a perfect poise
Galloping, galloping, clink and clank,
Knee to knee and shank to shank,
Kings of the droving cattle-boys!
See them now through the blue-gums tearing.
Silent as death—not even swearing—
Mile on mile ’neath the blazing skies
Bound on some fateful enterprise.
You can guess their quest by the hoofs' dull
thunder —
Love of woman or lust for plunder?
Are they hunted? Do they pursue?
Speeding like hounds with the fox in view,
Lanky Harnott and brother Jim.
Galloping, galloping, creak-a-creak.
Hands held low at the saddle-peak.
Headed out for the wide world’s rim.
In a far-back hut, fenced round with paling.
Who knows but a young, fair wife is ailing?
Noble are those who would bring relief
To a woman’s pang or a husband’s grief!
Strange at a time of such distress
They should ride so calmly in holiday dress!
Yet, with such men, we might hold it
stranger
If one whispered “outlaw” or cried “bush-
ranger,”
If with troopers behind and a tracking
black
They were galloping, galloping, neck and
neck,
Never a stay and never a check,
Down the long line of the wallaby track!
Looking again on those faces candid.
Who would accuse them of clean-skins
branded?
Who would mark them ns cattle-duffers?
Somewhere, perhaps, a maiden suffers.
Struck by the hand of a jealous lover.
Blood on the sheets and the patchwork cover.
Strong as their thoroughbreds are and fleet,
Fainter and fainter her pulses beat—
Do her dim eyes close on her hopes and
joys?
Galloping, galloping, stride for stride.
See how bold and balanced they ride!
C'an death out-distance the cattle-boys?
Maybe a soul at the end is striving
To cling to the robe of flesh for shriving.
Bring him a priest that he may confess him.
Anoint him with oil and devoutly bless him!
Hold high the cross till his eyes discover
The one divine and compassionate lover!
Speed for the pardon the Church will take
him.
So at the last we may fitly “wake" him!
Surely there rides his urgent ghost,
Galloping, galloping, lost for speed,
Pale as his own unwearied steed,
Racing down to the winning-post!
The race with death must be nearly ended.
Two to one on the riders splendid,
And the rare bush nags with their daunt-
less mettle!
You’ll be there when the bookies settle.
Past the tall timber and down the valley,
Hear them crash through the whipping
mallee!
AFTER THE INSPECTION.
GALLANT OFFICER: “It's not. a bad life, taking things
all round.”
MISCHIEVOUS TRAVELLER : “Oh is THAT what you
call us — ‘things' ?”
Out on the plain with the Devil after —
Hear the sound of his mocking laughter.
Grim are the taunts that his tongue
employs.
Galloping, galloping, clinkum-clink,
With his cloven feet and his hide of ink.
Swift in the track of the cattle-boys!
Look at the long, lean bay extended,
Low to the ground : and the grey is splendid,
Flashing his eyes like a sunlit scarab —
Straight from Musket he claims the Arab
Stay for a week, and his mate’s the same.
Toxopholite, too, and as big and game.
Now they are riding with heels and hands;
They see through the haze where the town-
ship stands.
Lift him, Lanky! Go for the lead!
Galloping, galloping, dinkum-dink—
Lord, though the Devil is in the pink,
I’m backing the boys of the cattle breed!
A sliprail gate and up and over.
Still neck and neck, the Saint and Rover.
Are those the walls of the longed-for fane
Or the doctor’s house on the arid plain?
My eyes are dim and I cannot tell:
I only know that they ride like Hell.
Those two great men from the Murray side
For soul or mother or near-to-bride.
Dry as the dust and faint for grub,
Galloping, galloping Shingled snakes !
It’s a stone-dead heat for the Liquid Shakes;
For the winning-post is Macgoogan's pub.

A Ballad of the Barcoo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A TALE of overlanding men who bring
the Kidman “fats”
Across the Queensland border (city
readers, lift your hats!) ;
A tale of drovers staging dry to Oodnadatta
town ;
A tale of Bill and Steve and Jack and
(mostly) Andy Brown.
They hailed, the five Brown brothers, from
the back of the Barcoo,
And all could ride and drink and fight. But
Andy counts as two.
Now in a stampede Bill got tramped, a
scrubber bull gored Jack,
And Steve died in the horrors on the over-
landing track;
But Andy kept on droving all along the
Queensland route —
For the man who’s once a drover there’s no
other job will suit.
The sprees he had were many, and the fights
were many, too,
But that’s the simple way they have who
come from the Barcoo.
In course of years (it might be five, it might
be six or seven)
Big Andy overlanded —no, he upper-aired—
to Heaven.
lie didn’t know the track he took, or why,
though down in town
The papers printed columns of the hero,
Andrew Brown ;
’Twas when the Big Drought broke at last,
and someone’s kids and wife
Were drowning in the Barcoo floods —and
Andy lost his life.
When Andy (to resume the tale) shot up the
heavenly course,
He’d got his stockwhip, spurs and togs, but
didn’t own a horse ;
The track, he thought, was breezy, and the
stars as he passed through
Were different from the mulga scrub and
bluebusli of Barcoo ;
So the soul of Andrew Brown was glad when
all at once he spied
The boundary-fence of Heaven, and there
St. Peter just inside!
St. Peter waved a bunch of keys and dipped
his haloed lid.
“Come in, good Andrew Brown,” he said;
and straightway Andrew did.
“I’m glad to see you,” said St. P., and then
to Andy flings
A nightgown, harp and halo and an outsize
pair of wings.
“You can change them in the traveller’s
hut”; then added with a wink:
“And if you strike old Noah there, perhaps
you'll score a drink.”
Now Barcoo men have Barcoo ways, and
Barcoo ways are coarse,
And Andy, being a Barcoo man, said, “Quick,
get me a horse!
You can keep your fancy tackle, but a horse
I’ll have. . . .and, oh,
Where are Jack and Bill and Steve?” he
asked —“they came here years ago.”
But St. Peter, scenting trouble, murmured:
“Andy, sad to tell,
We’ve not a horse in Heaven, and all your
brothers are in Hell.”
You have heard of high Olympus, and of
Jove who lived up there;
When he spoke he roared like thunder, and
his thunder split the air.
Jove’s thunder wasn’t in it with the row
that rocked the" sky
When Andy landed left and right to Peter’s
point and eye.
The old chap took the count, of course, when
sudden down the straight
A mob of seraphs sprinted at full feather for
the gate!
NO TIME FOR PRELIMINARIES.
“Miss Flyrte, I love you.”
“But we’ve only just been introduced.”
“I know—but I have to go on duty at nine.”
And as these seraphs flew they harped, and
sang a hymn of joy
(The only hymn for Andy was “My Wild
Colonial Boy”) ;
But when they saw St. Peter prone, his eye
a purpling blue,
And Andy with his eighteen foot of green-
hide waiting too,
They seemed to all remember they had left
some gear behind,
And wheeled in mass formation—which was
not to Andy’s mind.
“You lot of ewe-necked scrubbers, you! You
pea-struck mob of screws!
I’ll show you what the likes of Andy Brown
will do to yous!”
With that he grabs his outsize wings and
claps them to his back;
Then, his stockwhip cracking volleys, he is
tailing on their track.
You may talk of yarding scrubbers and such
silly sort of rot —
Why, in a twink the Barcoo man had yarded
all the lot!
And there they stood, all crowding, like a
mob of silly sheep,
A sight to make a cattleman like Andy go
and weep!
II(> spied one taller than the rest by half a
head or so—
He’d been a linen-draper’s clerk in Mel-
bourne down below.
“Now, then, you skew-winged streak,” he
said, “you round me up a horse!”
(He said a good deal more than that, but
Barcoo men are coarse.)
“A young, unbranded colt,” he said, “that’s
never known a girth,
And soon you’ll see why Barcoo men can
beat the best on earth.”
It was lucky for that seraph and a square
foot of his pelt
That Andy kept his stockwhip hanging
loosely at his belt,
For suddenly, careering down like lightning
from the sky,
Came a thoroughbred archangel with defiance
in his eye!
THE PARTING SHOT.
MRS. SNOB : “We arc going to live in a more decent suburb .”
MRS. SNUB : “So are we.”
MRS. SNOB: “Really! Are you moving, too?”
MRS. SNUB: “No, we are staying here.”
His wings—they had a ten-foot spread—were
both of golden hue;
With the pinion feathers crimson and the
wing-tips azure blue.
He held a trumpet in his hand, and blew
it as he came,
While his halo trailed behind him like a
cloud of yellow flame.
“It’s Gabriel! Alleluia!” sang the seraphs
with delight.
“I’ll give him allelluia,” said the Barcoo
man, “all right!”
The great archangel hovered, then glided
smoothly down,
And with wings politely folded, settled close
to Andy Brown.
“Will you please explain,” he started —when
a w r hoosh, a whirl, a jump !
And Andy’s whip sliced off an inch or two
of angel’s rump;
Again the stockwhip cracked, again, again
and yet again,
Till the great and good archangel writhed
and whinnied in his pain.
He’d grit, though, had the angel; with his
halo as a rope,
He tried to lasso Andy, but he hadn’t any
hope;
His trumpet arm was broken and his ribs
were like raw meat,
For the wielding of a stockwhip to a Barcoo
man is sweet.
Andy played the tamboroora on that great
archangel’s hide,
Then he leapt and landed neatly ’twixt his
wing-butts, legs astride.
When an archangelic brumby meets a dinkum
Barcoo man,
And the fight is to the bitter— w 'l, since
ever Time began,
There was never such a eon.ba, ! Andy
ripped the rowels deep :
The other somersaulted, then he volplaned
down the steep.
He slithered, whirled and turtk d, he bumped
on moons and stars ;
He violently collided with the b.'g red planet
Mars.
On the Barcoo there’s a saying (every stock-
man knows it wclD :
“When you mount an outlaw, beat him—-or
else ride him down to Hell.”
It was rough on this archangel that he met
the Barcoo breed,
For from any other rider he’d have very
soon been freed:
But at last he knew it hopeless, it just
simply had to be.
“You’re a beaut!” said Andy proudly.
“Come on down to Hell with me.”
For the word had reached Headquarters of
the Andy Brown affair,
And the great archangel reckoned they’d be
best away from there.
With one halo loop as snaffle and the other
loop as reins,
Andy rode the angel Gabriel down the nether
deeps and plains,
Till, lo! beside a brimstone creek, beneath
a flaming gum.
Were the Devil and his brothers, playing nap
and swigging rum.
Now Barcoo men can ride and drink, and
Barcoo men can fight.
But at any sort of gamble Barcoo men are
also right.
Had the Devil cared to stake it he’d have
lost his Kingdom Come;
As it was, the Barcoo brothers had won
nearly all his rum.
So, when all things are considered, it had
happened rather well
That Gabriel and Andy winged it full-tilt
into Hell.
The Devil flicked his forky tail, the great
archangel shied,
But Bill and Steve and Jack they leapt at
once to Andy’s side.
“And how are all the Barcoo boys? We wish
that we were back
Among the overlanding mobs along the
Queensland track ;
There aren’t no horses here in Hell, and
nothing much to do
But frizzle.” “Get you back,” said Nick
“get back to your Barcoo.
“Get back, you Barcoo men, get back! In
Hell I have no room
For blokes who ride archangels’ backs and
blow the Trump of Doom;
You Barcoo men beat me at nap; you drink
me out of booze.
I’ve had enough—a bellyful—of men like you
Barcoos!”
So off the four Brown brothers flew from out
the deeps of Hell,
While the voice of the archangel trumped:
“I’m staying! Fare you well!”
And that is why at dead of night who bring
the cattle down,
Hear overhead the tramp of hooves, the voice
of Andy Brown,
The cracking of four stockwhips loud above
the dreaming trees,
And the lowing of sky-cattle borne along the
midnight breeze,
And why when distant thunder booms the
Barcoo stockmen tell
How Andy Brown’s archangel still trumps
thunderbolts in Hell.

BERNARD INGLEBY.
The School for Husbands.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HERE’S an end of Gladys, girls. He?
Oh, he’s shot up into the Backblocks,
of course, leaving the poor kid. It
was Nellie Marks told me. She’s down in
the mouth herself. Her sailor boy’s gone off;
and, even if he comes back this way, how’ll
he remember Nellie? Life’s hard on girls—
work-girls.”
The owner of the third share in this com-
munal sitting-room flung hat and bag on
the divan.
“We aren’t ordinary work-girls.” Margie
hitched forward the gas-ring with one hand,
and with the other reprovingly flicked a
novelette from the grasp of Phyllis, who
was thus solacing herself for temporary
loss of factory work.
“Oh yes, we are !” Jessie, the eldest, sat
down on a cretonne-covered grocery-box, and
pulled at an art silk stocking while looking
for its mate. We’re what work-girls really
are. and not as the storybooks make up;
and the men, too —the men we’ve got to
marry—are not patient and steady and good
to marry, but wild and undisciplined, and
having occupations that make it possible
for them to get rid of sweetheart or wife in
a moment. Why. the wicked earl isn’t in it
for danger with a bricklayer! So quit read-
ing that book”—Phyllis had picked up ihe
volume—“about Flossie, the millhand, and
the machinations of the wicked baronet. A
baronet’s the safest ‘bloke’ for a girl of our
‘clawss.’ ” with exaggerated mispronunciation.
Margie, sister of two steady hodcarriers,
flashed round. “Snobby!”
“Not! To me the working-man of my
own ‘clawss’ is far more attractive than the
white-collar gentry. Also he’s more mentally
alive. But the earl is tied to his post mostly,
and the tied-up man has to pay up; same
with the middle-classer. Remember the
junior in the manchester department who
had to marry the girl, or she’d tell? Fancy
a railway-worker, or a bricklayer, or a sea-
man being sacked because he’d betrayed fam-
ily life! Even if anyone raised a cheerful
laugh by trying it on. he’d only need to
flit to another town. They’re privileged—
all of them.”
Phyllis put down her book. She began to
wonder if this were the real reason why she
had cold-shouldered a somewhat erratic car-
penter in favor of the postman who, how-
ever, had not yet proposed.
“There ought to be training-schools for
them—schools for husbands —-where they
could stay and get disciplined a year or two.
A year or two? Twenty years would do
for some of them, the beauties!. ... Yes,
come in !”
A man stood by the gently-opened door,
but did not obey the invitation. He seemed
about thirty-seven, but, though his eyes
looked that age, his face was curiously un-
lined. Ilis suit was new, of a brown color
and ill-fitting. His hands were large and
rough. In one of them he held a dangling
circlet of cheap silk.
“I picked this up on the stairs, and fan-
cied"—
The three admired the tactful way in
which he alluded to his find.
The trio took a great fancy to Andrew
McCutclieon, who had come to occupy the
room below them. Often, later, they dwelt
on how odd it was that he should have ap-
peared just when they were discussing a
school for husbands. He made the impres-
sion of having gone to that school.
He was the quietest man-neighbor they had
ever had. And tidiness ! Each had glimpsed
his room once or twice —the quilt drawn tight
with tombstone effect, shirts folded with
more than landlady neatness, and collars in
a quoit-like pile! They heard him once put-
ting up a bookshelf; and later (when he
became a visitor) he put up a bookshelf for
them; then did some skilful mending of their
jazzy table—also some window cleaning as
“too dangerous for girls.”
These facts atoned for his neglect in
refraining from the usual little dance to get
on the outside of the pavement when he
accompanied their shopping.
Had ho been brought up in some curious
establishment, such as they had imagined?
There was nothing wrong about him, for he
was on good terms with the policeman. He
liked officials, he said. He hoped, through
them, to get work in the Backblocks if he
failed in obtaining a job in town. He did
not talk much of his previous situation ; but
the girls had an impression that he had
remained in one job for about twenty years.
But, pleasant as he was with the girls, he
would not accept their invitations to even
their simple parties.
“No, I do not like men,” he admitted,
“not since I came to the city. I like women
best.”
“Then you must take a wife back with
you!” Secure in her just-formed engage-
ment to the postman, Phyllis spoke frankly.
McCutclieon lit a pipe. He smoked some-
times, though he never drank. “I’m afraid
the other fellows would not like it.”
“Oh, I know. Same old thing—won’t take
wives to the Backblocks. But”
“I think it will end in my going back,”
wistfully, but without sadness. “They may
send for me.”
“But they can’t make you go back, Mr.
McCutclieon.” Jessie was maternally brisk.
“No, they can’t make me,” he responded
slowly; “but there was something like a
promise. And then it’s such a great busi-
ness.”
Somehow they knew they were not to ask
the reason. He had that manner sometimes,
a manner that atoned for what, even to them,
might have seemed over-meekness and defer-
ence. Some trade secret, no doubt.
The trio always declared that none of
them was in love with McCutclieon. He
seemed to them rather a symbol of the
Larger Hope, when all working-men would
be trained to be husbands and to avoid the
earl-like temptations of “getting out of it”
to which their kind are subjected.
TRAINED TO IT.
VISITOR (witnessing accident to the milk-
bucket) : “Does he always milk in that
attitude?”
FARMER: “Yairs. I got ’im from a garage .”
“I wish you’d stay with us.” He was sit-
ting with the postman’s fiancee near the
shiningly-clear window. “You’ve really no
right to waste your time in the Outback.
You’re like someone trained to be a hus-
band.”
His face had a still glow upon it.
“You have made me very happy by saying
that. Nothing could please me more —or
reassure me —than what you have said.” His
glance wandered down to the street with
its passers-by.
It was later than usual when Margie re-
turned from her work next day. She had
been buying a necktie for McCutclieon. He
was too fond of blacks and browns, she con-
sidered, and was musing over some of the
chaffing she would give him, which he was
just beginning to appreciate.
She barged into the sitting-room, where
he was to have tea.
.Jessie was weeping fiercely by the table.
Phyllis, an unopened novelette beside her.
looked awed and pale.
“My God !” Jessie raised a stormy head.
“Isn’t it just like the bally men ; isn’t it just
like them! To waste years in training as
husbands men who can’t be!”
“What in Heaven? But isn’t Mr. Mc-
Cutcheon coming up? If he doesn't like us
we mustn’t be selfish about him. I’ve got
an invite for him to the Girls’ Club.”
“Girls’ Club!” Jessie’s rendering of a
mild fit of hysterics was excellent.
Phyllis looked up. “We’re not to tell.
He went back to the monastery this after-
noon!”

“ many mince pies as you taste at
Christinas so many huopy months will
you ” Old English saying.
“Twelve Months of
Health & Happiness.'
When the Christmas spirit of goodv* ill is abroad, many sincere
wishes for happy days to come are liable to be conceived of enthus-
iasm rather than of wisdom.
The time-honoured custom of Old England, in which thetasting
of a multitude of mince pies was popularly supposed to ensure well-
being for many months, is a case in point. The wise man, trusting
to ensure that well-being by a proven recipe rather than by an
ancient myth, would rely on
“One Wolfe's Schnapps a Day
for his Health's Sake "
knowing that on health is based happiness and realising that the
Wolfe’s formula would be far more pleasing than the tasting of many
pies, and decidedly without the same element of risk.
To synchronise your daily Wolfe’s with the conclusion of the
Christmas dinner would therefore prove a sensible precaut’.on.
Not only would it signify to over enthusiastic well-wishers the in-
tention of adhering to this golden rule of health but it would
actually serve its legitimate medicinal purpose on an occasion when
it was particularly to be desired.

The Rival Navies of Lollilootoo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN spite of laws paternal framed
To give the niggers all their due,
Bud Snickysnatch, already famed
For keeping profits well in view,
From Lollilootoo quickly made
Big profits by pursuing trade.
With remnant cargoes cheaply bought,
The simple islanders he hailed.
The poor, blind heathen-men he taught
To value any junk he trailed
From Sydney to their happy isles;
They soon were clothed in more than smiles.
Because he told them they were just
The thing the Great White King possessed
They bought green parasols. On trust
They took his statements, and were dressed
In brief-bags, top-hats, beads on strings,
Bed cliest-protectors and such things.
Two rival chieftains shared the isles,
Each jealous of the other’s sway,
Their envy helped the trader’s wiles—
To Tappo he had but to say
That Gai was sporting Oxford bags
To make him buy some kindred rags.
The tribes the competition backed
With zeal that even ran to toil.
As payment for his goods, they stacked
For Bud the product of their soil.
’Twas strange to see in that soft clime
The niggers working overtime.
The more the trader took them in
The more to his advice they clung;
So Tappo with a simple grin
Upon the trader’s saying hung
When—“ King,” he gravely said, “no State
Without a navy can be great.”
Immediately did Tappo ache
To show a dinkum king was he;
And, zealous for the chieftain’s sake,
The trader found a T.B.D. —
One of a pair that he, by hap,
Had bought in Melbourne Port as scrap.
His terms were pretty stiff, but glad
Were Tappo’s niggers for their prize.
Although the craft no in’ards had,
To rile the rival tribesmen’s eyes,
Canoes were manned with many a shout
To tow their ship the isles about.
Gai’s heart grew troubled at the sight;
He sent to Bud a piteous plea.
But Bud soon made his troubles light—•
And sold his other T.8.D.!
And thus the rival factions there
Became in naval matters square.
For Bud it was a time of gold.
To uniform the niggers he
A wornout play-house wardrobe sold;
They learnt the hornpipe (at a fee)
As something (he had told them so)
That true-blue sailormen must know.
The factions took it turn about
To tow their ships from isle to isle;
With twisted chivs and tongues poked out
The folk ashore they strove to rile,
Until their feelings grew so sore
They sought arbitrament in war.
As Minister for War to both
Bud sold them blank and showed them how
The guns were fired. Then, nothing loth,
The warriors from stern to bow
Scrambled aboard —the tug-canoes
Had to crimp women for their crews.
As though twain hives of bees had swarmed
The floating naval strengths appeared;
And from each deck the loud yells stormed
Defiance, as the rivals neared;
But when the harmless cannon roared
The startled crews dived overboard.
When some regained their drifting ships—
The tow-ers, terrified, had fled—
With nervous eyes and twitching lips,
Tappo, with seaweed on his head,
Issued a challenge with a roar
To wage the naval fight on shore.
MAKING HIM SERVE A DOUBLE PURPOSE.
JULIET : “And have you arranged the menu, for the wedding break-
fast?”
ROMEO: “ Yes—the missionary who marries us will stay on.”
With glad yells to the beach they swam,
And there got to it, without nause,
Fighting with zeal no fears con' 1 dam,
Clnb, spear and meat-axe, toe Ji and clavrs,
Till Tappo, ere his last breath flew,
The last surviver chopped in two.
Two rusty masses mar the sands
Of one of Lollilootoo’s isles.
And near them oft a white man stands,
Like one who has abandoned siniDs,
Longing ’gainst hope to get away
From those who watch him day by day.
For now two thousand women claim
(They sank his launch to make him stay)
To call Bud husband. Brain aflame,
He hears those widows, day by day—
Till bees seem buzzing in his head —
Extol the virtues of the dead.

Love and Fear.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE were four Brennan boys, but
never a girl, save a slender, diminu-
tive person, with twinkling eyes,
whom they all called mother, but who
would, after all, and despite the greying
chestnut curls, never be anything but a
merry-hearted girl. Throughout the district
IN HER HANDS.
“What do you do with yourself of an evening?”
“ Nothing—the wife does it."
the name of Brennan was coupled with
horses, and any garrulous person in the dis-
trict could tell you, and would tell you, that
old John Brennan’s boys weren’t going to let
the family reputation down.
Not likely, and them with a More as their
mother. The Mores were as reckless, as
daring, as clever among horses as even the
Brennans. There was Mick —he was the
boy with the hands for a horse. Lord save
us ! Silken-steel. If you wanted to make a
real horse of a young ’un—well, hand it over
to Mick. -When that boy was a nipper of
not a day more than four he used to shin
up the foreleg of old Brennan’s big Clydes-
dale, get a grip on the mane, and one hoist
and there he’d be, astride that great, broad
horse, looking more like some new kind of
flea than anything else.
There was that Arnie now. Twenty he
was, and tall, and straight, and brown ; and
ride —gad ! It was worth seeing that boy-
sit a buck. He’d sit there while the hide
stuck and enjoy it, too. His white teeth’d
be shining, the way the boy would laugh.
Bruce was only fourteen, but ask anyone
around about Bruce and his little creamy
jumper Bob—they'd tell you. Ask anyone
that went to the shows about Bruce and
Bob—they’d tell you !
But my tale .concerns Jan, the last of the
Brennan boys—Jan who at twelve had never
ridden anything but fat, old barrel-round
Banker. Nothing they had been able to do,
neither threats nor
kindness nor open
contempt, had ever
been able to wean
Jan of an awful,
unreasoning fear of
anything approach-
ing a spirited horse;
They had prevailed
on him to learn to
ride on old Banker,
and he had come to
love the exercise,
under the feeling of
security produced
by the ancient
pony’s placid per-
for-mances. But his
riding never pro-
gressed any further.
The rest of the
family had become
accustomed to this
odd member in their
midst. Occasionally
the boys threatened
to tie him on
whichever colt or
filly happened to be
newest broken, but
Jan smiled tran-
quilly. At nine
his brothers had one day, despite tearful
protests, put him on a quiet but spirited
filly. Something had frightened her. and
she had bolted, turning a complete
somersault over the house-naddock fence in
her maddened fear. Three big Brennan boys
flew frantically over the paddock with horri-
fied eyes and white, speechless lips. Jan
had been stunned, and Mick had picked the
limp form up in liis arms and strode back
to the house with an unbearable pain at his
heart. But Jan opened his eyes, met the
tortured gaze of Mick’s blue ones, and smiled
serenely. After that Jan’s riding lessons pro-
ceeded along the lines prescribed by Bank-
er’s stately gait, and Jan was quite happy.
When the subject of her small son’s defec-
tion came up, Mrs. Brennan smiled wisely,
tenderly. She wondered. One day, or a part
of one day. flashed back out of the past, vivid,
alive to her mental sight. She saw again
the smashed buggy, the terrified browns,
plunging and snorting, and John —God ! And
John ! Then the mad barebacked ride across
country for a doctor on the faster of the
buggy pair, with a frantic hammering fear
at her heart that help for the maimed,
crushed body of her man would be useless.
The doctor had pulled him through—and
.Tan had been born that same night.
Both parents were smilingly tender over
their youngest son’s deep-rooted aversion to
horseflesh that had a tendency to spurn the
oartli in its dancing gait. She had seen
him turn white and physically sick at the
sight of Arnie belting into a bucking, squeal-
ing colt with his dilapidated old felt hat, his
face fairly glowing with enjoyment —a sight
that she herself fairly revelled in. And yet
the height of pleasure to the boy was to
spend the day riding the paddocks with his
mother. Although even she refused to ride
anything half as lifeless as the aged Banker,
of gentle consideration for the sick nervous-
ness that her keen mother’s eyes appraised
and pitied, she resolutely kept her mount at
a steady gait during the whole of tlieir rides.
The flying gallops, the mad slithering down
rocky declivities, the wild racing and chas-
ing and jumping that she, sparlding-eyed,
pink-cheeked as any girl, indulged in when
out with the elder boys or their father, were
taboo when in the company of .Tan. At
times the boys, in sudden impatience, or
openly scornful of Jan’s weakness, would
send him into a lit of shaking, absolutely
uncontrollable fear with a display of daring
jumping or a harum-scarum gallop through
the timbered paddocks. But never his mother,
never. And the boy repaid the loving ten-
derness with a love amounting almost to
adoration.
They were riding one of the back pad-
docks after a lost heifer one evening after
one of those long, happy days that Jan re-
velled in. They had eaten their dinner,
washed down with faultless billy tea, under
the shade of a shaggy, wide-limbed box,
drooping with cushiony, creamy-scented
flowers. Sandy had sat upright, and begged
beautifully till given his share of corned
mutton, at which he wagged his long, bushy
tail joyously and subsided in contentment.
Sandy was mainly bushy brush and eager
faithfulness.
Jan’s blue eyes glowed. He choked with
the ecstasy of his own thoughts—shy, boy-
ish thoughts that the mere idea of putting
into words would have rendered him panic-
stricken, scarlet-faced. But his eyes glowed.
He wished, oh, he wished he could ride
like Arnie, or Mick, or Bruce —Mum loved
it so. It must be jolly slow, jogging about
all day with him. When she went out with
the others you could hear them coming a
mile off, shouting, laughing, galloping!
“Well, Mum”- —he rose and stretched him-
self casually—“this won’t find, the red heifer,
will it?”
They packed up and rode off, her mount,
Bob, decidedly resentful that he must keep
pace with Jan’s sedate steed. Mother was
laughing, holding Bob in and trying to show
Jan a nest in the top of an immense old gum.
“To the right, Jan, of that big fork, see?”
she pointed with her whip, and laughed gaily
as Jan shook his head, calling him an “old bat.”
And then the peaceful sweetness of the
blue day was shattered with a cataclysmic,
overwhelming suddenness —complete, terrible.
Adro'ss the path, almost under Bob’s dancing
feet, flashed a shimmering slither of brown-
ness. Bob leapt frantically upright, for-
ward. sideways, and the next moment the
horrified Jan saw his little, laughing mother
crashed against a low-hanging limb. Bob
sprang forward, snorting, with an empty
saddle. For one terrible second the boy’s
world spun in a black circle....
Then he was on his knees beside her, cry-
ing, beseeching her to speak, shudderingly
endeavoring to staunch the blood that was
flowing in a horrible, horrible steady stream
from the dear head. His handkerchief was
soaked. He searched desperately for hers, his
mind groping wildly after first-aid instruc-
tions. Why hadn’t he listened, learned?
“Oh, she’s dying, she’s dying! What will
I do! Motliie, Mothie, can’t you speak?
Darling Mothie, won’t you speak?” Then
he remembered, and fought desperately to
fight down his panic: Mother had only him
to depend on now ; only him.
He flung his light tweed coat on the
ground, and tore his white slnrt over lm
head, leaving his young body bare. With
hands that shook terribly he cut and tore
both sleeves out of the shirt and rolled them
into a pad, which he held for a minute
against the dreadful wound, then pulled away
to see if the bleeding had stopped with the
pressure. A little exclamation of joy
escaped him as he saw that it had to a
considerable degree. Holding the pad in
position he tied it on with the aid of band-
ages torn from the shirt. He began to cry
again as he kissed her wildly and prepared
to go for help—five miles home and then,
after that, another seven into Warrego for
the doctor.
She might die ! Perhaps she was dying now!
Sandv, sedately holding Banker by the
rein, wagged his tail at Jan’s approach, and
whined wistfully in the direction of his
mistress.
Immediately in the heart of the boy the
great idea flashed. Not for one instant did
he hesitate. The sweat beaded his forehead,
he was shuddering uncontrollably, but no
thought of shirking the ordeal entered his
mind. He would send Sandy home and
gallop across country to Warrego for the
doctor, which would mean that by the time
Sandy reached home he would already be
clattering up the main street of Warrego.
He took his mother’s handkerchief with
its sinister staining and put it in Sandy’s
mouth. “Home, Sandy,” he said sternly.
“Home, boy!” and Sandy, with a frantic
wave of his tail, went like a shot from a gun.
Trembling with mingled terror and grief,
the youngster caught Bob and managed to
mount. One despairing glance at the still
figure beneath the box-tree, and then, bend-
ing low, he gave the creamy liis head.
“And —and please, dear God, help me to
stick on!” he breathed fervently through
ghastly lips, for there were at least two
fences that he knew of between him and the
main road to Warrego, and diverging from
the track to the gateways would mean many
extra miles and precious minutes. Bob could
do it, and so could he, he determined, as the
pony, gathering his feet under him, slid
down a rocky hillside. Jan’s eyes were
strained with fear. Just so had he seen his
brothers come down, but never had he thought
to do it himself.
At the foot of the hill a timbered flat
stretched away to the first fence. The sun
glinted on the wire redly, and Jan set his
lips. He was not trembling at all now.
His hands were steady on the reins, but he
kept saying over and over in a sobbing voice:
“For mother—for mother !”
The fence leapt at him like a live, wild
creature striking. He heard the ping of
Bob’s hoofs on the wire as he gave a mighty
bound, and went up, up, up. Every nerve
was strained to breaking-point, waiting for
a sickening crash. Then over—over like a
bird. And he was still on!
“I —I stuck on, God!” he cried wildly. “I
—I stuck on !” And, unguided, Bob for the
space of five minutes continued his wild
gallop, while the boy sobbed hysterically on
his neck.
When he raised his face it was glowing,
shining with a new strength and courage.
THE NATURAL
SEQUENCE.
“My dear, it’s not the
marriage that costs
the money — it’s all
the expenses that
come afterwards.”
“Oh, that’s all right. I have a pal a divorce
lawyer who wouldn’t think of charging
me anything.”
The spirits of all the Mores and Brennans
had triumphed at last, and there was one
more Brennan upholding the Brennan repu-
tation.
Sandy would be almost home now. Per-
haps had already delivered his terrible mes-
sage. He pictured Sandy flying up the ver-
andah steps, standing upright with his paws
on dad’s chest as he offered his sinister gift,
and daddy’s eyes—oh, it was terrible! And
Bob, whom he had steadied for a space, leapt
gallantly ahead again at the involuntary
pressure of the heels at his side. The other
fence loomed up, and beside it the broad, red
road to Warrego.
“Up, Bob, up!” he cried, and together
they cleared it and sped on again.
Old Doctor Grey, gloating in his garden
on the beauty of a new pink rose, was pre-
sently electrified at the sight of his godson,
young Jan Brennan, clad only in trousers
and boots, flying madly down the main street
on Bruce’s creamy, a pony that Dr. Grey
knew only too well in ordinary times Jan
could not even catch, let alone ride.
“What now, in God’s name?” he muttered,
and ran to the gate.
Jan poured out his tragic story, and the
doctor, giving him one long marvelling look,
threw mysterious things into his kitbag and
ran his powerful car into the street.
“You’re done up, son,” he said gently.
“Hop in and come back with me.”
But the boy was running his fingers ten-
derly through Bob’s mane.
“I’ll ride, thanks, Doctor,” he said quietly.

The White Gin.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ANDERSON rode over the crest of the
sandhill and looked out over the glit-
tering expanse of sand and salt;
brought his gaze back from the hills cook-
ing in the haze four miles away on the
opposite shore, and rested it on the object a
bare twenty yards out from the edge of the
lake. He rode down to the level, threw his
bridle and stepped gingerly along the deepen-
ing ruts in the deceptively solid-looking
ground to where a little car squatted ludi-
crously on its undersides. There was a trace
of a smile on his lean, brown face as he
looked it over.
Anderson hadn’t seen many motor-cars,
and those lie had seen only served to heighten
his contempt for them as a means of trans-
port through Central Australia. He had
earned several easy pounds towing them over
the soft, steep sandhills with a pair of
staunch draught-horses. This one didn't
promise any towage fees, however; it was
stuck too fast, and settling slowly even as
lie watched it. The running-boards were
below the level of the quicksand now, and at
the present rate the top of the radiator
would be out of sight in another three hours.
“Their funeral!’’ he said aloud, after the
manner of men who ride much alone in the
solitudes. “If they’d stuck to the road”
He pulled his feet out of the quicksand
with heavy glu;;s and went back to the edge,
where he examined the tracks. It was
several hours since the solitary motorist
had abandoned his machine. Anderson looked
at the sun. Nearly midday. The sun blazed
out of a colorless sky, and the glaring red
sand flung back its heat like the open door
of a furnace. The saddle was so hot after
the few minutes of exposure that he had to
ride in the stirrups for a while. Mechani-
cally he followed the tracks to the road, a
mere set of wheel ruts in the sand, and ran
them along. Twenty-three miles back to
water. .. . On foot, in this heat. ...
Mile after mile the tracks held surely to
the road, along the level of the scorching
plains between the long sandhills, crossing
one occasionally, and on again along the
next Hat. Ten miles, and the tracks sheered
of toward a clump of timber denoting a
waterhole a mile over to the left. Anderson
kept straight on. He smiled a little grimly
as he saw the tracks come in again about
three hundred further on. The hole had
been dry for three months. Another five miles,
and again the wavering track sheered off, to
the right this time, to inspect a sparsely-
timbered creek running parallel with the
road.
The ground was hard here —brown, sun-
baked earth, covered with round, windworn
stones; brown, withered tufts of grass cling-
ing tenaciously to their footholds between
the stones. Anderson rode straight along,
a keen eye on the side of the road. But
the tracks did not come in again. On ahead,
in the shimmering mirage, the creek turned
in towards the road. He didn’t expect to see
the track again till he reached there. In
the bed of the creek, a mere depression where
the road crossed it, he came across the falter-
ing footprints, scarcely a foot apart, and
zig-zagging from one meagre shade to the
next. Not far, now. Down the creek a
mile or so he came upon a hat. Further on a
shirt.
Rounding a bend in the deepening -channel
he saw a man sitting in the shade struggling
to take off his boots.
“Go away!” he said, thickly, hardly able
to move his blackened tongue. “I know
you’re not real, but I wish you wouldn’t
bother me.”
Anderson noticed the correctness of speech,
even in that hoarse, cracked voice.
“I’ve seen you riding out there for hours,
but I didn’t think you’d come in close. This
is bad.... Must pull ’self ’gether.... Bad
sign.... Get heavy boots off; might make
waterhole jus’ roun’ ben’ now'.... Please
go away.”
“Better hang on to the boots, mate —
rough goin’ ahead. Here, have a bit of a
drink.” Anderson pulled the lid out of his
quart strapped on the saddle, and poured a
mouthful from the collar waterbag.
“Thanks, old chap.” The cultured voice
was firmer again after the sip of cool water.
“I was getting a bit hazy, I’m afraid.
Couldn’t believe you were actual flesh and
blood.”
Different, very different, from other men
he had found, Anderson thought. They usually
fought like cats for more and more water,
swearing, pleading, crying. His feeling
warmed toward the slightly-built man who
could hold himself so well in hand. He put
on his shirt and hat again, and sat in the
scanty shade with Anderson. At intervals
he drank the sips of water proffered him,
and in half an hour, when Anderson rolled
him a cigarette, he was able to sit back and
enjoy a smoke.
“How far are we from water now?” he
asked. “I seem to have lost count of how
far I walked.”
The hard line of the bushman’s mouth
bent a little, and creased his cheek at either
side. “ ’Bout a coupla hundred mile —the
way you was makin’. Tough goin’, too—
Lake Eyre right on your track; hundred
mile o’ dry, salt bog. ’Bout eight mile, if
you’d stuck to the road.”
“I must have been in a bad way. You’re
nearly all in when you discard your clothes,
aren’t you?”
“ ’Nother hour in this ’eat an’ you’d ’ve
been diggin’ for a soak with your hand. Yes,
close go. Fit now —any good with horses?”
“Yes, I have ridden a little.”
“Better git aboard, then, and follow me.”
“But —you mean you’re goin’ to walk?”
Anderson merely nodded as lie shortened
the stirrup-leathers. The horse was quiet,
but he stood at its head while the other got
into the saddle. “On’y about six mile to
my place,” he said over his shoulder as he
struck off over the stony plain.
The sun was dipping low behind them,
and the cockatoos and galahs were returning,
screeching, in hundreds when they came to
lvanallory. Cattle were moving leisurely out
of the shade where they had camped all
through the heat of the day, some going
down to the big waterhole for a final drink
and standing lazily about, belly deep in the
water, gazing placidly across to the other
side. Cockatoos lined the water’s edge in
some places, and swarmed on the limbs of
a giant fallen gum lying far out in the hole.
On the' far bank a curl of blue smoke rose
high against the foliage of the trees from
a low, rambling building of rough-hewn slabs.
A light glowed in Anderson’s deep-set
eyes when he turned and saw the look of
open admiration of the newcomer’s face as
he sat watering his horse.
“Not bad?”
“I think this ; is wonderful —beautiful!
And I would have missed it all if everything
had run smoothly.”
Anderson pulled off saddle and bridle and
let the horse go.
“Don’t you put him in the paddock?”
Again that slight creasing of the leathery
skin about Anderson’s mouth. “Ain’t any
paddick. You’re out of the fence country now.”
A young woman met them on the veran-
dah ; tall, with black hair, and the mystery
of the open spaces in her big, expressive
eyes. When she spoke quietly, as one
accustomed to the great silence of the plains,
it was with a softening and slurring of con-
sonants as though she had formerly used one
of the Southern European tongues, yet there
was no trace of accent.
“Traveller —motor-car went bung—bogged
to the eyes back in Booroongie Lake,” Ander-
son briefly introduced his guest.
“Good evening, Mrs.”
“Anderson,” the bushman filled in.
“Shoulda told you. Bill’s my moniker.”
“I’m sure I’m glad to meet you, Mrs.
Anderson. Binns is my name.”
“You look tired, Mr. Binns. Walked a
good bit, eh?”
“Yes, quite a long way, as far as I remem-
ber. I Avas in a fairly bad way when your
husband came along.”
Anderson got ready a shower —a perforated
bucket on a pulley—and fitted his guest out
with a change of clothes.
“This is wonderful,” said Binns as he sat
and enjoyed a good meal. “You people make
me perfectly at home without any question
as to who I am, where I am going or any-
thing.”
“That’s your business.” Anderson said.
“Stay as long as you like. You need a

dry.”
“I don’t know how to thank you, Mr.
Anderson.”
“Bill, they call me. Save the thanks,
anyhow. It’s nothin’.”
“Bill. You’re a white man, at all events.
I can’t help thinking it was Providence led
me to try that racetrack-looking surface at
the lake. I was going past the people I
most want to meet —people like you and
your good wife.”
“Goin’ far?” It was the first question
Bill had asked, and he put it diffidently. It
seemed more an excuse to change the con-
versation.
“I’m going to Wanda Plains, to christen
the Willetts’ children.”
“To christen ’em? God’s truth, are you
a —parson?”
“Yes, Wilton Binns, of the Bush Brother-
hood.”
“What! Wilton Binns—the Fightin’ Par-
son ?”
“I believe they do call me that.”
“Well I’m damned ! A man shoulda picked
you, anyway. On’y a handful of you, but as
game as an ant. I’ve heard o’ you—who
hasn’t, in the bush? Never thought you’d
get this far out, though.”
“We have an idea it is up to us to go
wherever we think our services might bring
comfort. The AVilletts’ children, for instance,
nine and seven years of age—and no chance
of getting them christened for years, unless
one of us happened along.
“Perhaps I could be of some service here.
Your children now. I don’t suppose they’re
christened?”
Bill looked hard _at the parson. Mrs.
Anderson was clearing away. He nodded
toward the door, and they strolled outside
and sat on the verandah. Bill stared over
into the blackness under the trees across the
waterhole. "No, they ain’t christened,” he
said slowly.
Neither spoke for some time.
“You can’t christen kids if—-if their mother
ain’t”
The Fighting Parson gazed steadily into
the weather-beaten face. He dropped a
friendly grip on Bill’s shoulder. “But I could
remedy that.”
Bill was silent for a long while. He
rolled himself another cigarette. A flood-
bird screamed, away at the hole; a lone cur-
lew wailed.
“I don’t know’s you could. It’s —it’s
diiferent. She’s not —white.”
Wilton Binns waited, watching the play
of some strong emotion on the features
faintly illumined by the glow of the cigar-
ette. .
“A man meets no women here, gettin a
place of ’is own goin’. No time for trips
‘below’.... You can’t live like a hatter,
though. A man ain’t that way—if lie’s a
man. There’s gins come around cadgin’ a
bit o’ tucker. The blackboys I had workin’
about the place was always skitin' about a
white gin with a tribe over in the Macumba
country. They was that blasted certain about
it I took a ride over an’ tracked the tribe
down. She was there all right—a picture,
no more’n a quarter black, if she was that.
Mullyullurrun. they called her. The old gin
that ’ad ’er raised a stink. Sooled the bucks
on to me. They didn’t count for much,
though.”
Binns ran an eye along the brown arm,
crooked in the act of relighting a cigarette,
the flare of the match showing a ripple ot
whipcord muscle. No. The bucks wouldn t
count for much.
“Bill.” he said. “The faint trace of color
your wife lias should be no bar. It seems to
be entirely eliminated in the children. Ask
her if she will go through the ceremony.
Let’s go in right away.”
Mrs. Anderson had finished clearing away,
and sat knitting when they came in again.
“I say, Laura,” Bill started awkwardly as
she looked up. “What about us gettin’
married?”
Wilton Binns seemed to see her for the
first time as she looked from Bill’s face to
his and back again. A picture—Anderson
had been right; she was. That look of
innocent surprise, mutely questioning, made
him imagine her as she was when she first
looked on Bill, the first white man she had
seen, perhaps. Those big, dark eyes, baby-
ishly round, with long, curly lashes. A light
shone in them, faded, and flickered out, leav-
ing a wistful sadness.
She shook her head slowly. “No, it
wouldn’t do,” she said in a low. soft voice,
“Doesn’t Mr. Binns know I’m only a gin?”
“Yes, I told him. But he says what’s the
odds? You’re more white than black, no-
body’d know the difference, an’ you’re good
enough for me! Then there’s the kids—
nobody could call ’em bastards if we was
properly hitched, and them christened, an’
e\erythin 0 . • rflninß
Swiftly changing emotions slujwed plainly
in her beautiful face as the stditlmg pioposi
tion presented itself m varying aspects.
“But, Bill—you won t always want to be
tied to a gm. You re dom well now, an you
could build a flash house here, an get a car,
an’ have a dinkum white woman for a wife
—an’ all that. White men do have gins, but
they let ’em go—after. I can go when you
get a wife.” Her voice trailed away till it
was hardly more than a whisper.
Bill leaned over with as much of a show of
emotion as he ever allowed himself. “Look,
Laura,” he said. “It ain’t like you to talk
like that. Did I ever treat you like a gin?
Ain’t I always told you I’m stickin’ to you
for keeps?”
“Yes, Bill, you have. But still”
“Listen, Parson,” Bill interrupted. “You
get out your Bible, an’ put us through. Come
on, Laura ! We got the parson on the ground
ready to do it all for us, so’s the kids can
go into the stud-book with their pedergrees
all slap-up. Here, this ring I gev you will
do—on’y wants loanin' on the book an’
shovin’ on a different finger.”
“I'm afraid my Bible is. at the bottom of
the quicksand in Booroongie Lake,” the par-
son reminded him.
“Hell —yes!” Bill frowned. “Never mind,
I know! There’s that old one your black
granny had when you come with me—to
keep devil-devils away! It’s still aboiit some-
where —what the dryrot and the white ants
’as left of it. Does it matter if it’s a bit
hipdown-lookin’ ?”
“Not at all! I can get along without a
prayer-book—l’ve got the marriage service
well memorised.”
Bill went into one of the other rooms
and reappeared with a battered Bible. “Some-
thing the niggers got from a mission-station,
I suppose,” he half apologised, "an hawked
it around thinkin’ there was a god actually
in the thing. Will it do?”
“Oh yes. Nothing wrong with it at all,
for our purpose. You have a ring, you say?’
Laura put the hand with the ring behind
her. “No, Bill,” she said. “I can’t let you
go on. It ain’t fair. Besides you might hate
me when you find you’re tied to a—a gin. ’
Bill turned to Wilton Binns. “Look, Par-
son. Can you do anything with her? She
won’t take no notice o’ me.”
“Let me retire to my room. Perhaps, if
I had other Help”
“Yes, that’s it. You take the book, an’
see if you can get the —the Bloke to work it.”
When Binns left the room, Anderson tried
again, using all the arguments he knew. Her
resistance only made him the more deter-
mined. He loved her, and this self-effacing
attitude of hers showed plainly the depth
of the love she bore him. lie was still
pleading when Binns came back, a glow in
his eyes, and a new look of excitement,
triumph almost, on his fine features.
“My friends,” he said, quietly, “you should
have read this book before.” lie laid it
open on the table, while Laura and Bill
looked at him wondering.
“What’s in it?” said Bill.
“Bead it for yourself. It tells its own
story.”
Bill came around the table and looked.
There was some hardly discernible writing
on the fly-leaf, in pale, faded ink,
so faint that it took him minutes
to make anything of it.
“What’s the strong of it, Par-
son V” he said. “Looks like some-
thing of the kind you hear about
—people writin’ their births and
deaths in the Family Bible? Hal-
lorau the name looks like—is that
what you make it?'’
“Yes, Halloran. And that is
just what it has been used for. It,
'was used by your wife’s people!
Can’t you see it? The last entry
—“daughter Mary’’—Molly she’d
be called. Molly Halloran —‘Mul-
lyullurrun’ the blacks would call
it.”
Bill’s eyes opened wide, as a
wonderful possibility struck him.
“God’s truth!” he said. “Ilal-
1 o r a n ! Ha lloran !
There was a family of
Hallorans wiped out
be the blacks thirty
years ago at Amber
Lagoon I’ve heard
the old man talk
about it often. iCould
it be them? Would it be likely some old gin
hooked on to one o’ the kids an’ took it
away? Would it be likely she took that Bible
with her? Might lia’ been workin’ at the
house—nurse-girl, an’ kep’ it on the strength
o’ what she’d heard the missus o’ the house
say about it sometime—God, an’ all that!”
“It is wildly improbable,” said Wiltoß
Binns, “but we cannot fathom the working
of the savage mind. To me it looks the most
convincing birth-certificate for your wife!”
Bill swung towards Laura, his eyes search
ing her face with a new, wondering look. Ihe
dark, Southern beauty he had always admired
in seemed to explain itself now. Irish,
that was it. He went over and put lm
arm about her, caring nothing for the third
Party s presence. Laura, he said. Don
you get the idea? Lou re white. High
through. White as me an the parson. Is
“There is no shadow of doubt about it!'
„ Ig that truer Laura looked from qn<
man the other. Her eyes shone witl
the stirrings of pride of race. Her chin was
held a little higher, and there was a differeni

“it’s dinkum!” said Bill,
“A fact,” the parson added.
“White,” she said, her voice dropping low
“And if your car hadn’t got bogged, Mr.
Binns, we’d never ’ve known it!”
“We have to believe that all things wort
out for the best,” he said,
Two days later, with one of Anderson's
best horses under him, and a complete caml
outfit on a sturdy packhorse, Wilton Binns
rode away from Kanallory. That night as
he sat by his campfire he took out hr
fountain-pen and emptied out the waterec
ink. “I suppose everything does happen foi

OUR XMAS GREETINGS TO ALL
“At every stage of life’s high road
Good Luck and Pleasure meet you!”


If I Had a Son.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH the dawn’s a-greying up on the star-
board quarter,
It’s time to strike the bell, and for
my turn below;
The wheel she's a-kicking, there's a chop to
the water,
The north’ard looks like wind, and I think
that she’ll blow.
"And it’s home, dearie, home”.... Aye,
homing to your dearie —
That’s a song for some men, but not the
likes o’ me,
A sea-soaked sailorman that’s stiff and old
and weary,
His only home the fo'c’s’le and the wide,
salt sea.
If I had a son now, I’d say to him: “My
laddie,
Don’t you go to sea, boy, but stay you
snug ashore,
For roving round the world, lad. you’ll learn,
like your daddy,
That roving holds no joy but what the
land holds more.”
Talking to my son, I would din him one
thing only—
“ Comfort’s by the heart, with a wife to
fuss and fret;
What’s to gain,” I’d say, “where the seas
are wide and lonely
But a lone old age and a harvest of
regret?”
If T had a son now, I’d say to him: “My
Johnny,
Dance and light and sing, lad, the while
your life’s aglow;
Make love to a lass while her eyes are bright
and bonny,
And take your fill of pleasure while the
years run slow.
’Tis not what you’ve done that will trouble
you hereafter,
Not the friends that failed you, nor yet
the girls you kissed,
But the lone night-fret that will rob you of
your laughter,
Thinking what you might have done—all
the fun you’ve missed.”
I know what I know, and if I'd a son to
mind me,
“Ev’ry port’s tl c same port,” I’d say, “to
sailormen.
Here am I a shellback, with all my years
behind me,
And what have I gained now from there
and back again?”
I have no son to mind me—where’s the use
in beefing?
Ships and the lonely sea are all the kin
I’ll know- -
It’s a-blowing up to gale, and the sails want
reefing.
But the fo’c’s’le’s my home when it’s my
watch below.

DICK HAEEIS.
The Longest: Night.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SWINGING round the curves, roaring
through the cuttings, rolling up the
miles on the long straights, on rushed
the great express through the night. A
hurricane of steel to those watching it pass,
a streak of light in the darkness, something
to stir the blood or to put the fear of God
into a timid heart.
FIXED HIS LOCATION.
S T.PETEE: “What brings you here?”
NEWEST ARRIVAL :“ Struih , a cow kicked me.”
S T.PETEE : “Ah, you’re from Australia.”
J o the four men dozing in the carriage,
however, it was a dreary business enough,
this all-night journey. “Miles to go—miles
to go—miles to go—to go—to go, miles to
go,” chanted the fat commercial sleepily.
“Where d’you get that one?” asked the
young man who had been a soldier.
“That’s the song of the wheels—listened
to it for the last twenty years; don't know
where it came from; must be one of my
own.”
“Not half bad, anyway.” It was the poli-
tician who spoke this time; half-asleep
though he was, the habit of taking the centre
of the stage asserted itself. “Miles to go
to go—to go. Jolly good! Well, we’ve
a good many miles to go yet. eh? What
about a little game of bridge—keep us from
going blue-mouldy.”
The fourth man, a pitifully faded little
clergyman, had not yet spoken. Slumped
down in the fourth corner opposite the fat
commercial, he looked a pathetic figure in
his worn dusty-black.
To the bridge the others assented list-
lessly, and the politician commenced a rum-
mage through his suitcase for the cards.
“Well, I was certain —no, not there either!
Must be in the van. Have either of you
cards?”
“Not me.”
“Nor I.”
“Well, that’s that, and we’ve still about
three hours to go. Have you a pack of
cards, Padre?” he asked in desperation.
"I'm very sorry, no; I am afraid not,” in
a tired voice.
The politician sat down. Everybody was
now thoroughly awake, weary and bored.
“Miles to go—to go—to go,” clanked the
wheels.
"I seldom remember having spent a longer

“Stunning costume your husband has. But why the cow-
bell around his neck?"
"Oh, that’s my idea. I. put it there so's I can hour him
when lie’s coming.”
night.” It was the little clergyman’s first
voluntary remark. It sounded more like an
appeal for sympathy than an assertion of
fact.
“Oh, I do, Padre,” answered the politi-
cian promptly. “I remember once But
that gives me an idea, gentlemen, an idea
to while away the time. Suppose we each
put a ten-shilling note into the pool, to form
a prize which will go to the man who tells
the best story of the longest night he remem-
bers to have spent. We will draw lots for
the order of the telling. Here, now, I will
put the slips into this hat.”
He passed the hat round and each drew
a slip.
“Ah, here is No. 1,” and he held up the
slip which all the others had rejected. “Who
has No. 2?”
The young man who had been a soldier
held up his slip.
“No. 3?”
The fat commercial assented with a show
of interest.
“And you are No. 4, Padre? Padre, we
will appoint you adjudicator. Now, then,
ante up, and we can begin.”
Three ten-shilling notes fluttered on to
the seat beside the politician, who then
looked inquiringly across at the worn little
clergyman.
“I —I am frightfully sorry. I have to
admit that I haven’t ten shillings by me just
now.”
"Here —here’s the Padre’s ante.” and the
fat commercial put down another note.
* -* * *
"Now we can begin.”
“I think the very longest night that I
over remember to have spent was”
“Pardon me,” said the tired voice of the
little parson. “Would somebody mind put-
ting up that shade? That light, it hurts my
head. I am very tired—thanks so much.”
“was,” continued the politician, “the
night my eldest child was born. Picture,
gentlemen, away out in the country. The
sudden, urgent call —it came about six in
the evening. No time to get my wife to
the hospital, only time to telephone the
doctor. Then, when the doctor did arrive
with a nurse, he promptly told me to clear
out — me, who was more concerned with the
issue than anyone. ’Go for a walk,’ he said;
'you can do no good here. But don’t go too
far away.’
“That was between six and seven. I
walked away, then I walked back. Nearly
eight; no news. I heard some dreadful
sounds upstairs, and I walked away fast,
for the fear of God was upon me. Nine.
Still no news, and afraid of what I might
hear I hurried away again. Ten. Eleven.
Twelve. One. The doctor came out, on
the run; nearly knocked me down in the
passage. As I caught at him, he forgot that
he was a doctor with a bluff to keep up.
‘Get out. of this! Go to Hell! I told you
to go for a walk’—he’d forgotten that that
was seven hours ago.
“Two. Three. Four. Still no news. I
was not conscious of fatigue, though I had
been on my feet since six. If I had been
a drinking man I might have found relief
that way. I was certain she would die---
must die; and I could see the light from
her room every time I returned to the house,
and I wondered how much longer she could
stand it.
“Five ! The dawn was breaking as I re-
turned once more. The doctor met me on
the steps. lie reeked of chloroform, and
looked worn out, too.
“ ‘lt’s all right, Walker,’ he said. ‘They
will both live. Been a nasty case: better
not try to see your wife for a bit. Yes, it's
a son.’
“And that, gentlemen, was the longest
night / ever spent.”
-X- * * *
The young man who had been a soldier
cleared his throat.
“Well,” he said, “I am not much of a
talker, but I’ll try to do my bit. “It hap-
pened down on the Somme when we were
pushing Fritz back a few yards a week, at
a cost of goodness knows how many thou-
sand men a day. I was detailed to take a
raiding party across to Fritz’s trenches and
bring back prisoners. You know the sort
of thing, done preparatory to an attack—
find out the units opposed and all that. Well,
we got over No Man’s Land all right—one
had to watch out for Very lights and so on,
you know, or the party would be seen and
potted before they got there.
“It was a merry little jaunt for a while.
We bombed some of the Fritzes to Hell —
grabbed a couple alive, great, frightened,
slobbering hulks, and commenced to light
out for our lines. The game is to scatter—
fewer casualties that way—so when I went
down I was alone. It felt as if I’d been
kicked in the stern by a mule. Then I found
myself lying on my face in the muck, and
I felt all numbed.
“After a bit I commenced to work my
way towards our lines. I couldn’t use my
legs, so I’d dig my fingers into the dirt and
try to pull myself up to short arm. Some-
times I seemed to make a foot or two, but
as often as not my fingers would just slip
through the mud and my body wouldn’t slide;
besides, it used to hurt like hell, so that I
couldn’t keep it up for long at a stretch.
Every now and again a Fritz machine-gun
would clatter away behind, and I could hear
the bullets whispering and flicking all about
me.
“Funny part about it was that I didn’t
lose consciousness. I tried the whole blessed
night to make that fifty yards or so to our
lines, but I don’t suppose I crawled five all
told. And then I struck a shell-crater, and
d’you think I could get round that damned
thing?
“Suddenly, when the cold of dawn was
giving me beans, I thought I heard a voice
calling my name very softly, and I answered,
or thought I answered; but I could hear
that he was crawling away. Then I thought
of signalling, and I got my water-tin round
and tapped out SOS with my knuckles on
the empty tin.
“He heard that, and found me—plucky
beggar! It was Flynn, my batman, and he’d
been crawling about No Man’s Land for
hours trying to find me in the dark. He
got some of the A.M.C. chaps across, and
they brought me in. He didn’t get any V.C.
for it either.”
The young man who had been a soldier
ended abruptly, and for a time there was
silence, save for the wheels’ “Miles to go—to
go—to go !”
The fat commercial lit his pipe, and be-
hind clouds of smoke plunged suddenly into
his story.
“It was back in Gippsland in the old days.
I was travelling then for Toogood, Nobody
and Co., and we had to do most of our pok-
ing about on horseback, the roads were so
bad.
“There was a lonely place there known
as (Cassidy’s—just a slab hut; couple of
rooms with a bark roof. I don't know how
the old coujde lived, but the place had the
reputation of being a shanty. Anyway, on
this particular night I had had to' take
Hobson’s choice, and make for Cassidy's for
shelter. It was dark when I saw the square
of yellow light from the window. I had a
lot of money on me, too, mostly in cash, as
I had collected a good many of the firm’s
accounts that trip.
“I pulled up the nag in front of the house
and called out. I hadn’t reckoned on the
dogs, though, and before I knew what was
happening a horde of the brutes rushed out,
barking, heeling the horse and making the
Devil’s own row generally. Next, I knew
I was on the ground with the horse and
the dogs on top of me. The Cassidys came
running out, and they soon got me disen-
tangled ; but when I tried to get up I found
I couldn’t move. I reckoned that my leg
was gone. They carried me inside and laid
me on the only bed in
the place.
“It seemed a long
time afterwards that
I heard them whisper-
ing together in the
other room. I heard
the words ‘kill’ and
‘money,’ and you may
be sure that I pricked
up my ears. I had
seen the Cassidys pro-
perly only once before.
One was a big, old
woman with a brown,
tanned face that was
a mass of wrinkles.
A face that might
have been a thousand
years old, with its one
yellow tooth, and the
chin with a scatter of
long, grey hairs. Her
eyes were as sharp as
razors, that cold, clear
bine of the North. The
old man was sham-
bling and nondescript
—a loose, slovenly old
hulk, with a fringe of
grey whisker round
his jowl, and a long,
sandpapery top lip—
he shaved once a
week, I reckon.
“‘No, no, Dennis!
ye mustn’t kill 'im
now. Ye must wait
till the mornin’ when lie’ll be fast aslope.
Remimber the shindy the hist wan of them
made.’
“There was a gruff murmur in reply, arid
then silence.
“I lay and sweated. The brutes! What
was I to do? I tried to move, to roll off the
bed with the idea of hiding in the bush, but
I couldn’t move my legs. I groped round
for a possible weapon, but I encountered
only empty air or fixtures. Once the old
crone tiptoed into the room, and between
half-closed lids I saw her peering at me as
she shaded the candle. All night Jong I lay
there waiting for the morning, wondering
each time I heard the old ghouls whether
my number was up or not. Once I heard
the quick rasping of a knife on a steel, and
I could hear the old hag whisper: ‘Sure, we
will have him finished by the sunrise!’
“Well, to cut the story short, I could al
last make out that the dawn was lighting
the sky; and then suddenly I knew that
they were both standing in the doorway look-
ing at me!
“No time to feign sleep this. I stared
at them, the top half of my body tensed up.
It was to be bare hands, and God help any-
thing I got a grip of!
“The old woman tiptoed towards me, and
I_ saw with a thrill that she was carrying a
big claw-hammer half-concealed by her
skirts. She stopped a couple of yards from
the bed, and peered down at me, and in the
growing light of dawn she saw that my
eyes were wide open and staring at her.
“ ‘Sure, then, ye are awake, sorr?’
“ ‘Yes, I am awake,’ I answered grimly.
“ ‘And have ye spint a dacent night wid the
poor leg, thin?’
“I didn’t answer, I was watching that
hammer; to catch it as it came and wrench
it away was the only hope that I could see.
Rut she turned suddenly to the old man
still standing in the doorway.
“ ‘Sure, thin, Dennis, ye can be doin’ it
now, the gintilmin is awake an’ won't moind.
Me man wants to kill the pig, sorr, and
we was afeared the squeals of the baste
would disturb ye!’
“And then I think I fainted; anyway, it
was broad daylight when I saw the room
again. The old woman was kindness itself
during the time I was laid up.”
“By Jove, there is the dawn! Now,
then, Padre, your turn ; you’ve just got time
to win the pool before we get in.”
* * * *
A silence followed the laugh which greeted
the end of the fat commercial’s story.
“Miles to go—to go—to go,” sang the
wheels as the dawn crept in, filling the car-
riage with a dim light.
But still the little parson remained silent.
“Your turn, sir,” said the fat commercial,
leaning forward and tapping him upon the
knee.
Then lie started back. “Good God!” he
said. “Strike a light, somebody. That
shade—pull it back !”
The politician and the young man who
had been a soldier started forward, awe-
struck. Four ten-shilling notes fluttered to
the floor, arranging themselves round the
worn boots of a dead man.
Tim politician picked them up. “These?’
he said, waving them vaguely towards the
others.
The fat commercial took them. “They’re
Ms, I reckon. Besides, maybe there are wife
and kids,” and he thrust them into the pocket
of the dusty black coat. Then they called
the conductor.
The night express stopped slowly at the
platform. The three got out, stiff and cold,
and made their way towards the exit. Past
the giant locomotive, with the sweat trick-
ling down its black, gleaming sides.
“That’s done— done — done,” it panted.

HERE our history was made,
Here our first foundations laid,
oacred is the ground you tread,
Rut its sanctity has fled.
Sturdy, solid squatters pass
lo that sombre plot of grass
Where the jacaranda-tree
Scatters lapis lazuli.
Lords of acres from the West
Drowsing in fat armchairs rest,
Each embalmed in solemn gloom—
How a jest would shake the room!
In this sacred, drear retreat
Solemn talk of wool and wheat:
Outside furtive shadows lurk,
With a tale of out-of-work.
Mausoleums congregate
In this stolid street sedate.. .
Plutocrats with spatted shoes
Elossoms on the pavement bruise.

Ghosts.
T HE cr i°kets c hirp, the stars are lit,
1 The door is open wide,
And up the track the white ghosts flit
And sit down by my side.
I know them well; long since they played
And roamed the lanes with me—
llK! blacksmith s son, the doctor’s maid
In young simplicity.
And Tommy of the Lathkil mill,
John of the stony ford,
Sweet Mary, Lucy from the hill
And little Robin Ward.
H ow close they press, and warm, it seems
T-hem eyes are fixed on mine;
lhey whisper me, and long-past’dreams
Jjive, and are all divine.
And, oh! I see primroses blow,
And daffies in the breeze;
Their petticoats and pinners show
Beneath the apple-trees.
The penny-moons so white and tall
!_ Among the growing corn,
The stonecrop on the garden wall,
The daisies on the lawn;
; The fragrant gorse afire in spring
The cuckoo in the tree;
White mushrooms in a fairy ring
They all come back to me.
;The doctor’s daughter died, and sleeps
Beneath the churchyard sod ;
Around her headstone ivy creeps
Her soul is gone to God!
The ghosts have gone from out the room,
isnadow on shadow pressed
A f n e f g l7 moth wings from gloom
And settles on my breast.

Our Fast Old Ship.
THE sun goes down before our path
And rises red astern.
Like creeping insects, doomed to wrath,
For wings and speed we yearn ;
Yet of the speed our old earth hath
We little seek to learn.
Twelve hours at four-and-twenty knots
Is scarcely a disgrace;
A thousand miles in hundred lots,
Our flashing airmen race;
Yet faster still the old earth trots,
For ever eating space.
The blue stars shining overhead
Entice us farther out
To planets dim, alive or dead,
Adream in night’s soft net;
And while they’re dreaming earth has sped
Where never, stars have set.
Why need we flog our engine fires
Or whirl our aero-blades
When we’ve a vessel that requires
No thought or human aids?
Let’s rig our globe with steering wires
And scorch through starry glades!
Let’s heave her through the Milky Way
And hear her mountains crack.
With steady helm, oh, let her sway
Down some old comet’s track—
A breezy morning-gallop, say,
Ilound Pleiades and back.
We’re wasting time inventing wings
To win aerial pace,
YY hilc earth herself for ever swings
At breathless speed through space
Bearing the hearts and knaves and kings,
And all the human race.

My Lady Dawn.
THE loveliest thing about my lady Dawn
Is that breath-catching silence ere
there wakes
Humanity’s distressful voice, the sound
Of gritting wheels, the rattle of tin-cans
The shouts of traders, strident bottle-ohs’
And men with summer fruits, half-ripe, half-
rot.
I can believe her standing at the edge
Of Brisbane’s river dipping one white foot
In the blue water slowly blushing rose,
With its warm rapture at her questing touch.
I see the fine grey mistiness of her
Caught robes, the amber shallows of her eyes
Ihe bared young shoulder that a star last
night
Stamped with five tiny points and left in
gold—
Betraying pressures! For no noon-hour
knows
Where dawning sleeps at night. Maybe she
finds
A deep-eyed lover in the shrouded hills,
And that is why her scarf of mist is torn,
So greedy he to keep her by his side
When earth requires her, earth her overlord.
And when she comes to him she has no word'
But stands there mute among the bending
grass.
Hearing the sparrows chittering in the trees,
Ihe black disturbance of the flying-fox
That like an evil fruit, hangs from the
branch
At strife with the dominion of the rose.

Orient crowning red and noisy Day-
While she, the lovely lady of the dawn
Has never word to speak. I think her heart

And blossom secrets of the covering dark
Her silence is more magical than speech •
Even the wind will not intrude on her. ’
I lieai it fretting in the mango boughs
Ready to rush forth when she makes a sign.
And, with its columned dust, blot out her

She chuckled and kicked her heels, she did
On her milestone grey.
She cupped her chin in her hands awhile

Oh, dark her eyes on the roads the while

Afterwards.
BEFORE the rain the grass was bleached
and dead;
The shadow's swooned upon the dusty
hill,
Trees drooped, unquivering, dispirited;
The low voice of the waterfall was still;
Lean cattle gasped through long brown noons
when all
Sought wearily the warm shade, side by
side;
And perfumes that were wont to rise and fall
On every breeze with the dry flowers died.
But afterwards, when raindrops dewed the
leaves,
Like colored beads on tapestries of jade
And gemmed the grasses, as a craftsman
weaves
His different sheens into a rich brocade,
The tallest peak wound long cloud-scarves
of pink
About a brow tattooed in indigo,
Half-hid by valley mists, till one must think
Of tranced princesses of the long ago!
A rainbow crowned the near hill’s bastion,
And once again the long-dry waterfall,
Like children running, laughing, here and
gone,
Hurried far down the hollowed rocky wall.
And afterwards—the happy afterwards !
The green, the scintillating, magic hour
When dripping bank and tree and gleaming
swards
Breathe hope anew to drooping leaf and
flower!
An omen, O my soul, that from the pain
„ And sore affliction that the body knows
You, too, may find the healing gift of rain
And wake to, glow and sparkle like the
rose!

Request.
READ me some rhyme that whispers
down the years—
A lilting echo of dim distant days;
I am world-weary, and a poet cheers
Who sings of simple things in simple
ways.
Tell me some tale that outlives every age—
The legend of a love that never dies,
Or find sotne richly old romantic page
That paints a passion under Eastern
skies.
Sing me some song—a softly dreaming
strain
Will make sweet sadness as the slow notes
fall;
So dreaming I might wake to dream again,
Deep-drugged beyond recall.

CHILDREN, children on the green,
Say, how often have you seen
Little loves with lips of laughter
Dancing where the dews have been?
In a high stone house I dwell
Where no fairy revels swell;
And for all your sun and laughter
Walls of stone are round my cell.
In that house sweet fears are known,
Which, like river mists low-blown,
Shroud the stream, the gulf, the mountain,
Shroud the maize field and the stone.
These are kindly Avails that shield
Men from gentle Love revealed.
Children, children, you have followed
Butterflies along the field!
Children, children, men have wrought
. Manacles from quiet thought
In the flutter of the nestling
Visions that the Passion brought.
Though my dreams grow petulant
Where the fretted sunrays slant
Should I mar your joy with questions
And the sorrow of my want?
Children, children, spurn my rue;
Chide the deities I sue!
All the, joy of life’s most blessed,
While my sorrow’s naught to you.

Understanding.
THAT old, strange story of the dawn of
life
Tells how God saw his work that it was
good,
When in the spring-time Adam found a wife
And Eve first wore the crown of woman-
hood.
Often to Eve the prompting serpent came
Till Adam, led by her, the law defied —
And then the thunder and the fig-leafed
shame,
The angry God who walked at eventide.
It puzzled me that Adam yielded so,
For surely it was good to be God’s friend,
And wander with him in the sunset glow’,
In that sweet garden, at the long day’s
end.
It puzzled me, this story of the past,
Till I met you—and understood at last.

LIFE is a dance to the music of Fate
Love is a song that the dancer is
singing—
Bright eyes and laughter and passionate
hate,
Dreams of desire in two white arms that
wait.
Tears of regret with the long years come
winging.
Dance and forget that the music must die
Dance and forget that the years bring
their sorrow;
Love is a sweet song that ends with a
sigh,
Youth is a glad hour that Time passes by;
Death is. the grey dawn that comes with
the morrow.

WHOM have I here? This man
With strong and hasty tread,
Whose eyes, above my head,
Look on another span
Than where his life began—
Is this my son, my little one?
O Time, how you have robbed
This heart, these empty arms
That o’er his smallness throbbed,
When, sick for swift alarms,
Love’s fearful anguish sobbed
Its grief o’er him, my little son!
Now comes this man to whom
I am but one beside
The road —a hostel-room
My heart! —who once had died
To shield from evil doom
The little one who was my son!
His step outpaces mine,
Which, could I run, were still
Too slow for me to twine
My arm with his uphill;
Too slow, whate’er my will,
Though once he was all mine; my son!
This man’s thought passes me,
And ranges out, alone,
Fields where his young eyes see,
’Midst seed that I have sown,
Seed I have never known —
O little one, who was my son!
Yet whence this man? Not this
The child I bore, who, day
By day, found all his bliss
Where in my arms he lay
And only asked my kiss —
My little one, my tender one!
Then were my arms his fold!
Then was my heart his haven!
Now fears he neither cold
Nor storm, nor winds’ wild raven
Whom once these hands could hold—
My son, my son ! My little son!
H.
Not mine, grown old in tears,
Not mine to bind on him
The burden of my years,
Who, on th’ horizon's rim,
Sees clear where my eye peers!
Not mine to call to earth
This searcher of the sky,
Whose wing, to gather worth,
Full-stretched must lift and fly;
Not mine by my own dearth
To bend him to a tie!
Oh, if love could but know
It must not hold to hurt,
Must free what on would go
And its own self desert;
And. when its pulse falls slow,
Gird though it go ungirt!
Therefore, not mine to chain,
rm To wei s llt these urgent feet
That will so soon find pain
Wijere freedom seems so sweet;
\\ Inch, when he most would gain,
Must still have stress to meet!
Only I ask that he,
When he in fulness grow,
Sometimes remember me—-
Sometimes look back as though
His heart my heart would know.

The Blacksmith’s Wife.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY man has his forge near the house.
It is blacker than velvet with soot,
Except for the soft-flowing fire
Or a burning shoe on a foot.
And the talk of the roads is there,
A birth, a death, a ring.
The corners are still when I come;
When I go they murmur and sing.
My imp is the love of the forge.
They mount him high on a horse.
He’s down and under its heels,
And I am a fool, of course.
The big, dull mares are kind,
But the colts are wicked and tall—
Oh, a blacksmith’s wife should be old,
Or have no children at all!
MAORILAND.
EILEEN DUGGAN.
After Two Years.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FOR the first hour or so Mason enjoyed
his return to freedom. The color of
the sky and trees pleased him. He
smiled contentedly as he headed for the city.
But his mood changed when he became
aware of the faces of the men and women
around him.
They all seamed to know where he had
been, and what he had been doing these last
two years. The very newness of his ill-fitting
clothes betrayed the secret he had prayed to
keep. It was as hard to bear the pity he
descried in some of those eyes as the ridi-
cule and disdain he saw in others. At one
of the crossings a newsboy winked at him
knowingly; and Mason hurried on, shaken —
he who, a couple of years before, would
have walked and talked with any man in
Sydney. He suddenly found himself hating
those scornful eyes that met him at every
turn, hating them with the hate of a wolf
for the hot iron. Again, he was afraid of
them, shrinking back from their regard,
limp and trembling, mutely asking for a
chance.
If strangers were so terrifying, what
might he not expect from his old friend and
employer, the man who had told him to
call back to the office “at the first oppor-
tunity”? Suppose Paddison reproached him,
or entered into the usual harangue on
repentance and all that sort of thing? At
that moment Mason feared what he might do
to any man who asked him if he was not
sorry, or who might even be just stupidly
clumsy in his well-meant kindness. But
“Want any cash?” Paddison had inquired
crisply.
Paddison was very busy when Mason
called at the Pitt-street office that afternoon.
Probably that was why he had compressed
the interview into five minutes. He had
asked the man about his health, and gave a
rather vague undertaking to hunt up a job
for hipi. Nothing more. And then he had
brought up the subject of money.
Mason fought back the cunning that
prompted him to declare himself penniless.
He was somewhat puzzled at the manner
of Paddison’s greeting, but grateful for the
common sense and kindness displayed by
the other man.
“A little” he answered Paddison’s
question with a lift of his shoulders. “They—
the authorities give a man some clothes and
a few shillings to carry on with. It isn’t
much.”
“No harm in starting small, though—eh?”
“No, sir!” The newly-acquired habit of
promptly agreeing with his superiors was
strong with him. “I’ve got to start from
the bottom again, I suppose.”
He tried hard to make that speech
sound just as he intended it should —like
certain stage heroes he had seen, who spoke
with such a thrill of manliness under their
frank confessions of wrong-doing. But he
failed somehow, and was conscious how
stupidly he spoke. He was grateful to his old
employer for passing the matter over negli-
gently.
“Just pull yourself, Mason, that’s all.”
Paddison shifted his chair a little as
though he desired to return to his work.
“No more shiftlessness, old chap, eh? That
was your trouble —doing the foolish thing
instead of the wise one.” He hurried over
this statement as though it were an un-
pleasant duty or an empty form prescribed
by custom. “Here’s a pound-note. Tell
you what,” he added, with a smile which
told of his real delight in doing what was
whimsical just for its own sake, “see how
well you can spend this, won’t you? I’m
not afraid it will go for rum, or”
“No, sir!” came the answer, positively.
“Exactly. Drink is not your trouble,” he
laughed as he passed the note across the
table. “I’d be more afraid of it going
towards a flutter in tin scrip down at the
Exchange.” The sudden allusion burned the
other man like a caustic. That had been at
the bottom of his trouble two years before
—a call for more margin, and the desperate
need of getting money overnight. “Sliiftless-
ness! ’ Paddison added with a smile that
soothed the hurt. “Now, suppose you
account to me for every penny of this. Make
it go as far as you can, and effectively.
That’s the point for yon. Understand? Sec
me again at nine o’clock to-morrow morning,
and let me know how you’ve spent this
pound. Meanwhile I’ll see what I can do
for you. Good-bye.” He got up, shook
hands, and Mason went out, warmed by the
cordiality of the grip.
“EH show him !” he muttered as he walked
out into the street again. “Not one farthing
for anything but necessities.”
He conjured up a vision of greeting Pad-
dison next morning with a new savings-
bank book in which would be entered most
of the money now glowing so comfortingly
against his heart. He calculated swiftly as
lie went along Pitt-street. Yes, he would
bank the whole pound. Five shillings would
cover the cost of a night’s lodgings and a
couple of meals. He had a little money of
Ins own—enough to provide him with the
comfort of tobacco and tram-fares until the
tide turned. Paddison was a good sort, he
decided. Hadn’t he promised to hunt up a
job for him? Mason raised his head and
saw the sky; he called on God’s throne to
witness his intentions. Not a farthing to
be wasted! Never again the loss of a
moment’s time!
The Savings Bank was closed when he
reached it, but that didn’t disturb him
greatly. He had made his plans, and he
would adhere to them. He would call at
AREN’T MEN BRUTES!
“He says, ‘ I’m gonna kiss you,’ and I says, ‘lf you do
I’ll knock you’ — un’ then he don’t.”
"Gee! If he’d insulted me like that I’d have donged
him one.”
the bank again next day. In the meantime
he could walk about and see something of the
world that opened about him. He turned into
George-street and headed south.
Free again! The friendly roar of the
street, the sweep of the tide-like crowd, the
thrill he derived from dodging a motor-car
at one of the crossings, and the chance he
got to smile at a comical advertisement in
a chemist’s show-window—it was like wine
to him. Once more he was taking his place
among his fellow-men—better than many of
them, since he had paid his penalty. He
was free again to hurry, to linger,- to rest,
to go where he wished. Free again from the
soul-racking torment of the measured day—»
so much work, so much sleep, and so many
ounces of food, never more, never less.
Instead of the stone and steel corridor, the
long vista of the street opened out ahead of
him. The doors that lined it opened into
shops and offices, not into cells that were like
coffins. There was nobody watching him
—watching him almost every moment of the
day. Free! The word seemed ridiculously
short and slight to carry all the weight of its
meaning. But then, love and hate are short
words, too!
Hunger eventually drove him into a drab
restaurant in George-street West. He ate
greedily in the intervals of trying hard to
realise that there was no need to hurry. The
habits acquired from his two years’ incar-
ceration had taken deep root. He only just
saved himself from piling up his dishes in
the regulation manner. It took considerable
effort to leave his place at the table a little
untidy, as if that were his usual custom.
For two years he had known that to break
the rules of neatness meant punishment.
Back in the street again, a craving for
tobacco possessed him, and he looked around
for a suitable shop. Fifty yards nearer the
corner he saw the usual sign on the window
of a grimy little establishment, and walked
in. On one side were stacks of newspapers,
gaudily-covered magazines, and an inexhaus-
tible supply of those alluring detective
stories which look so interesting until one
starts reading them. Stony-looking toffee,
fly-specked stationery, and a supply of
tobacco and cheap pipes filled one of the
show-cases, the whole supervised by a
wizened little man who in better days
might have been a tenth-rate pawnbroker.
The air of the place was heavy with the
scent of unkept bird-cages. In a row of
tiny coops, canaries twittered insanely; a
crested cockatoo, hanging head downwards
from his bar, uttered profound and cynical
remarks in his weird savage tongue. On the
counter, near the show-case, a grey ’possum
with frightened eyes crouched in his cage.
"Two shillings,” announced the proprietor
when Mason had made his purchase. “Want
a match V”
The man filled his pipe very slowly. The
hot rankness of the tobacco was like new
breath in his lungs. The ’possum lay still
a moment, then crept haltingly into the far
corner of the cage. It limped a little, mov-
ing gingerly on one paw.
“Lame, eh?” Mason was smoking very
hard.
“Yes, them wires makes ’is feet a bit
sore. Still, a man can’t do nothin’ for ’im.
’Ow about a canary, Mister? They’re real
birds, all of ’em.”
“Stay in those cages always, do they?”
Mason was turning over the pages of a
detective story.
“Yes.”
“Never been used to anything else, I sup-
pose.”
“No.”
“Makes a difference, maybe, when they’ve
never known freedom.”
The ’possum lay in the musty straw that
carpeted the cage. At first glance Mason
thought the little animal was frightened. He
saw now that weariness and sickness were
its main troubles.
“Nice pet fer the kids,” began the pro-
prietor again, searching the other man’s
face for some sign of his intentions. What
he saw discouraged him. The stranger was
no purchaser, this pale-faced man who stared
so hard, yet so furtively, at the caged
possum and the birds. But habit made it
difficult for him to treat a visitor as if he
were anything but a prospective customer
He tapped the bars of the cage; and the
tiny beast lay still, its flanks heaving like
those of a miniature cavt-horse.
“’E ain’t too lively this morning,” he
remarked.
“How long has he been there?”
“I’ve ’ad ’im very near two years.”
“Good God !”
“You can ’ave ’im cheap, Mister. ’E’s a
decent sort of pet fer the kids. I’ve tamed
’im proper.” The look he recognised was
coming into the stranger’s face, he thought.
“Twenty-five shillings, eh?” he insinuated!
“ ’E’s only young, yer know. Cheap, too i
’E cost more than that, what with the cage
an’ all.” He paused to watch the effect of
liis words. The other man made no move-
ment and the proprietor grew desperate. “I’ll
take a quid fer ’im, then,” he declared
magnanimously.
Mason drew a deep breath. Very gently
he smoothed the little captive’s head with
his forefinger.
“Nearly two years, eh?”
He set his jaw hard, and stood silently for
a moment, chin on breast. The grimy hands
of the wizened shopkeeper sketched a gesture
of hopeless resignation.
“ ’E’s a good quid’s worth, ain’t ’e
Mister?” ’
“Give you fifteen shillings.” Mason’s
head came up.
“’Ow about the cage, though?” com-
plained the other.
“Half a crown for the cage, then. Seven-
teen and six for the whole turnout.”
“ ’E’s yours, Mister. But I’m losin’ money,
I give you me word.”
Mason walked on into the University
Park. It was full of loungers; and once
more they had the look of enemies. Mason
passed them by, whispering encouragingly
through the paper he had twisted around the
cage. He carried his burden carefully and
craftily so that nobody might suspect what it
was. At any moment somebody might come
upon him unawares—the law, perhaps. One
could never tell about the law. It was always
at hand —always likely to come into the pic-
ture at the most inopportune time.
In liis heart the man carried the burden
of one who, in spite of appearances, knows
that he is doing the right thing. If later
there sometimes comes a certain satisfaction,
at first the feeling is one merely of stubborn
determination tinged with hopelessness. He
walked on past the loungers, eventually halt-
ing in a pathway surrounded by tall trees.
Pausing there, lie looked about him furtively
before placing the cage on the ground and
removing some of the wrappings. Fumbling
at the door of the cage, he found that time
had rusted it in a little, but presently it gave.
“Everything’s right, son!” he whispered,
opening the little door. “Out you get, and
be quick about it.” But the tiny prisoner
hesitated, blinked, and shrank back into the
cage. The man tilted the cage, and pointed
to the trees. “Look, son,” he counselled,
patting those heaving flanks gently. “You’re
free, now. You can go home for'good.”
He dropped to his knees, watching delight-
edly, his tired eyes bright again. Across the
path went the captive, with a queer, creep-
ing gait that makes the tree-dweller seem
so awkward on the ground. A little scamper
at full speed ; a momentary halt to view the
surroundings.
“Get a move on, lad !” The man waved
his arms. “Be quick !”
A tiny grey flash disappeared behind the
nearest tree-trunk. Mason thought he saw
something high up among the rustling leaves;
he thought he heard a little chattering and
chuckling somewhere in the air above. He
stamped the. cage into a shapeless tangle. He
smiled to himself as he walked out of the
park and returned to the bustling streets.
He was still smiling when he fell asleep
that night in the cheap lodgings which,
one night at least, he could call home.
“ — — and then,” he said next morning,
looking straight into Paddison’s eyes. “I
bought a ’possum for seventeen and six.”
“Well?” Paddison’s tone was non-com-
mittal. “Not exactly a sensible purchase,
think. Mason?”
“It ,had been in that cage for nearly two
years.” The man was not apologising nor
seeking to excuse himself. Pie was speaking
quite without expression. “I let it out
amongst the trees in the park. I don’t know
why—couldn’t help myself. I suppose. I
don t see what good it’s going to do, either.
The poor little devil seemed satisfied,
though.” He rose to his feet and picked up
his liat. “That’s about all, Mr. Paddison.
I think I’ve accounted for the money you
gave me; and” He broke off and looked
steadily at the other man. “If you start
preaching to me about all this, I’ll not
answer for the consequences,” he finished
savagely.
Paddison rose from his chair. “I haven’t
managed to find you a position outside,
he. said quietly. “To be candid,
I haven’t tried. I wanted to see what sort
of a man that two years had made of you.”
pushed open the door of the inner office.
Come along in with me, and I’ll show you
where to begin.”

Rio Grande.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TO Rio Grande we’re bound away,
But we’ll come back another day;
And if I ne’er return to you,
You’ll know that I have been as true
As other lovers that you knew.
Hey, Rio ! And away, Rio !
We’re bound for the Rio Grande!
Then fare you well, my nut-brown maid,
Who never has my trust betrayed,
Because —if I must tell it true
As simple sailors sometimes do—
I never truly trusted you!
So hey, Rio ! Away, Rio !
And hurrah for the Rio Grande!
On Rio Grande the gold-dust fine
Some day, fair lady, may be mine.
Then I will go no more to sea;
And you shall dance and drink with me
The whole night long so merrily!
Oh hey, Rio, and away, Rio!
I’m off to the Rio Grande!
In Cardiff town there lived a lass
With eyes like dew upon the grass
When morning breezes softly blow,
In Cardiff town there lived, aho!
A sailor laddie long ago—
Away, you, Rio ! Hey, you Rio!
Away, you Rio Grande!
His ship went sailing o’er the bar.
When he came back from lands afar,
He found his love-light married to
A gallant youth of eighty, who
Could buy her satins, well he knew!
So ’tis hey, Rio, and away, Rio!
And we’re bound for the Rio Grande!
Though seas be cold and skies turn grey,
To Rio Grande we’re bound away.
Oh, hearts may harden, tears may flow —
To Rio Grande, come weal or woe,
To Rio Grande we’ve got to go;
So hey, Rio, and away, Rio!
We’re bound for the Rio Grande!
The gangway’s up, the anchor’s weighed.
Now fare you well, my pretty maid.
I would not ask you “makee cly,”
My Almond-Blossom ; say good-bye,
For you’ll forget—and so will I!
Hey, Rio, and away, Rio,
We’re bound for the Rio Grande!
In Cardiff town a widow young
In vain her love and riches flung
Before a simple sailor who
Had loved her once, and thought so true

Gold and Spears.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IF you w-ant to go where that gold is you
must run the risk of getting speared by
blacks. Also, you’ll have to cross desert.
I don’t mean the kind of country that grows
a bit of spinifex, but real desert —sand, all
sand, with the waves the desert wind makes
on it.
That desert wind! I have felt it come
creeping and whining out from the sou’-east
DIDN’T MAKE ONE JOB OF IT.
“I thought those two were divorced?”
“So they are, hut not from each other.”
at dawn, so cold that it set my teeth all a-
cliatter. Two hours later it was a furnace-
blast that seemed to be taking the face off
me. And then sometimes in the flat calm
of high noon a little puff would come from
nowhere and blow a handful of hot sand
into my face. After that the wind would
give a little whimpering laugh in my ear,
and the calm would close round me again
like a blanket.
Hall’s Creek is the last of civilisation so
far as post-offices, stores anS policemen mark
it. but there is a
well as far out as
Tanami, and you
can get a bit of
tucker there. Then
you have to wait
for the storms to
fill the rock holes
with rainwater be-
fore you take a
header into the
desert. If the
storms were dry
ones—all wind and
dust and thunder
—you will perish.
And, I tell you,
you may get
speared. Some
people say the
blacks won’t molest
you if you leave
their women alone.
But I have known
men who behaved
like a Sunday-
school picnic get a
shower of spears
while they camped.
Still, if you don’t
perish or get
speared, you will
get gold all right.
That is if you go
to the patch I
know of. I went
there first in 1910,
and got more than
a thousand ounces,
and swore I would
never go back. But I went in 1918, and got as
much again—and swore never to return to
the country. Yet I went back this year and
got 3000 ounces. I swear by all that’s holy,
and by much that isn’t, that I’ll never go
again. But I wonder.
You see, there are two dead men there.
One of them doesn’t matter. He wasn’t my
affair. But the other—l worry about him.
I have two real good camels. A camel
is the best watchdog a man can have. He
lets you know if as much as a lizard stirs
round the camp in the dark. Niggers can’t
get near. Many a night I’ve sat up, with
my back against a camel and a double-
barrelled gun across my knees, out there on
the edge of the desert where the blacks are
bad.
It was the beginning of December, and
well into “the w T et’’ when I left Tanami.
I knew rain had fallen out where the gold
is. I made a good trip across, 70 miles of
sand, and came among the rocks and the
foothills just before dusk on the second even-
ing. There was plenty of water in the rock
holes.
I pitched my mosquito-net and made my
fire; but soon as it was dark I got the camels
and shifted on a bit.
There was a big mob of
niggers too near. I saw
tracks everywhere. The
camels were uneasy all
night, and so was I. I
am getting nervy. Queer
how a man gets like
that.
And then just beforeddarn,w r n, when it was
black dark, with a cloudy sky and rain
sprinkling, the camels let me know that
someone was sneaking around. I got low
down so as to have a bit of a skyline, and
presently made out something moving. I
fired a shot at it.
I got a surprise with that shot, for a voice
—a white man’s voice—called out asking
what the hell I was doing.
I let him come up to the camp, and then
I set fire to a bunch of spinifex to have a
look at him. He had a little swag on his
back and a couple of empty waterbags. He
was a wild-looking chap, with a short, stubbly
beard round his face. His hair was snow-
white, in striking contrast to his skin, which
was tanned very dark; and his eyes and eye-
brows were jet-black. I thought him a bad-
looking beggar who would stick at nothing.
I guess I was right.
He was huugry. The last of his flour he
had made into a damper the night before.
He had lost his mate and his camels —all
speared by the blacks. He seemed scared,
too, and was eager for day to break. But
he had a great heart, for lie intended cross-
ing that 70 miles of desert per boot. He was
going to fill his two waterbags and set off
travelling by night.
We had breakfast. He was mighty glad,
he said, to have met me. I believed him.
He could hardly keep his eyes off my turn-
out.
And then he showed me the gold he had in
his swag. It was just as much as he could
carry. There were slugs in it of over three
ounces. I could feel my eyes bulging when
I looked at it. But back where his dead
mate and the camels lay among the rocks
he said he had planted three times as much.
He had intended to struggle through to
Tanami, procure more camels, and come
out again and fetch it. But now he said
if I would go back with him we could bring
it away and go fifty-fifty. I jumped at his
offer. I got the camels in, and packed, and
away we went. It was nearly thirty miles
to the place, but we were there long before
sunset, travelling all through the heat of the
day. We found the gold, all right. He’d
pitched me no fairy-tale.
I saw no niggers and no tracks, yet he
swore the place was swarming with them.
He said they speared his mate at eighty
yards. We divided the watch that night,
and at daylight I let the camels go to get
a bit of feed. They had been living badly
the last few days. They went some little
distance from the camp, feeding. I went out
to get them about an hour after sunrise—and
walked right on to the dead body of that
man’s mate. He was a fair-haired chap,
young—l should think under thirty. But he
was all black and swollen. He lay with the
back of his head towards me, and I walked
round to get a look at his face. And I
got a shock. There was no spear-wound on

but he would not let me put a hand on him.
W hen I insisted he grew snake-headed and
nit out at me.
Next thing he went raving mad, and swore
that I had robbed him of the gold. He
stuck the muzzle of the pistol in mv face and
told me he would blow my brains out. But
he gave me time to say my prayers. I said
them, too. It astonished me what a lot I had
to say. I could have prayed for a day and a
night. And then he pulled the trigger and
the pistol only clicked.
I grabbed, the shotgun. It wasn’t empty.
1 shot him m the chest just over the heart.
At that close range the big shot tore a hole
in him one could put a jam-tin in.
I got the camels—they had stampeded
when the scrap started, and fled away from
the place as if the Devil were after me.
I got back to Tanami all right. A good
many men were there, but I didn’t say a
word about the gold I had in mv packs. I
pushed on to Hall’s Creek and sold 50 ounces
there and kept going.
I’ve been going ever since. I’ve got to.
It’s those dead men up there beyond the
desert, among the rocks. The one who died
first doesn’t matter. He wasn’t my affair.
But the other —I see him every night. If he
had that spear in his belly I wouldn’t mind.
But he hasn’t. He shows me only that
great gaping shotgun wound I gave him over
the heart. It’s as big as a billycan.
Will the desert wind blow the sand over
them and bury them when the dry season
comes? Or will they lie there for ever with
their black, sun-shrivelled skins and their
white bones gleaming?
I got 3000 ounces of gold. I wonder if it
was worth it? I wonder?

The Skylsrk
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O loudly sings the skylark
Above the pretty wheat;
If I’d as many eggs as she
I shouldn’t want for meat!
Superbly sings the skylark
Where laughing clouds deploy;
Her heart’s as bright as eighteenpence,
She tweets for love and joy.
Now, hidden, sings the skylark;
Her song tells where she went....
Alas — alas —that I must sing
For clothes, and meals, and rent!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FRESH-SHAVEN, and with his riding-
breeches on, Neil Macdonald came
to his tea. The weather-beaten face
of his father hardened, and pale-blue eyes
glowered beneath shaggy brows. Unheeding,
Neil busied himself with, the food the cook
placed before him. But the atmosphere was
electric. Wise in his generation, George,
the cook, hastily swallowed his meal and
strolled away to his sleeping quarters.. Obvi-
ously the feud was aboult to stir up further
discord, and George was bored with the feud.
Presently lan set down his emptied tea-
cup. His son had risen, and now, with a
foot on his chair, was lacing his breeches.
“Where are you going?” asked lan.
Neil straightened his broad back, and met
his father's sombre look without hesitation.
“To Macleod’s.”
“I thought I told you to go there no more.”
“In that matter I must please myself,
Dad. I’m doing no wrong.”
“Wrong?” echoed his father bitterly. “I
tell you, Neil, once again, I forbid you to
see Maggie Macleod.”
“Forbid?” The young man’s eyes kindled.
“My God, can’t you get away from your
Scotch craziness? Let me tell you once for
all that my hope is to see Maggie at my
side till I die. I’ve spoken to her, in fact.
There you have it, plain and brief. As for
all you’ve told me of Macleod himself—why,
what has that to do with Maggie and me?”
He concluded impatiently, “But we’ve said
all this before.”
Breathing heavily, the old man rose, and
by the twitching of his lip and the fierce
fires in his eyes, Neil knew he was seething
with repressed passion.
“We have not said enough,” said lan.
“Neil, you will listen. Outside lie seven
hundred acres of red soil and three hundred
of the best black soil in the Wimmera. Stock,
plant and land are mine. If you be sensible
and obey me”
Pale-faced, Neil cut in. “Is that it? I
suspected it would come to that! Well,
then, I don't obey you !”
“I denied you nothing in your youth,”
continued his father. “I gave you to your
country, and when you came back sound
I denied you nothing again.”
Neil regained control over himself. “That’s
all right, Dad. But now you’re denying me
a greater thing than all else. Think it over.
The love of a man for his mate is not a
trifling tiling.”
“I forbid you to marry Macleod’s girl!”
Argument was waste time. Neil knew
it well. The unwavering eyes of father and
son met. “I’m going to her now,” said Neil
curtly, and turned on his heel.
He went to his room for his coat and
leggings. Having buckled the latter, he
strode out past the kitchen door. In the
dusk of the houseyard his father intercepted
him.
“Neil, bring in the brown mare with yours.
I’m going with you.”
Astonished beyond words, Neil stood
rooted to the ground, then slowly, with
knitted brows, he went after the hacks. A
climax to all the dissension was looming
ahead. This night would tell.
* * # *
The old Scot was implacable. His son
knew this implacability sprang from the
grim characteristic that the Scottish High-
lands stamp always on the strong amongst
the children born beneath their spell. Neil
found it easy to understand why warriors
of the Macdonald clan, long ago at Culloden,
had rested sullenly on their weapons deaf
to all entreaties to advance—searing their
own savage hearts because of wounded pride.
This same dreadful implacability of purpose,
in small or great matters, had always been
his father’s dominating trait. It was like
a wall in which one could open no breach.
The Macdonald-Macleod feud sprang from
the days -when Neil was a two-year-old baby,
and when farmers were “selectors.” The
whole district knew the particulars. It was
no bloodthirsty vendetta. lan Macdonald
merely ignored the existence of the Mac-
leods, and never let that name pass his lips
in public, though the bearers of the name
were neighbors. He began the reign of
silence. Willie Macleod accepted it.
Once on a time Willie was an intimate
friend of the Macdonalds, and particularly
of Evan, who was lan’s younger brother.
The two were inseparables. A steady young
fellow in the beginning, Evan at length
began to neglect his selected block, and idled
about the countryside, mostly in the com-
pany of Macleod, whose nature held a leaven
of wildness always. The culmination was a
tragedy that plunged lan and his wife into
sorrow. Evan rode alone to Stawell one
day, began a drinking bout and fell down
a mine-shaft. He lingered, unconscious, for
days and died.
His last words —indeed, the only words
he spoke l after the accident—were that lie
was better dead, as Willie Macleod knew.
When taxed by lan for an explanation,
Macleod admitted that Evan had been hope-
lessly in debt to him for gambling losses.
Evan’s moroseness of many months, enliv-
ened by periods of hard drinking, now be-
came understandable to lan. Before this
his conduct had been baffling; for whenever
lan had begged his confidence with a, view
to aid him, Evan had denied point blank
that he was in any kind of trouble.
lan went from Macleod’s presence, raging
against the false friend, and with cause.
His younger brother was dead, and his own
wife, a delicate, dark-eyed woman, had been
driven to her bed by the sudden tragedy
that had brought death to her brother-in-
law.
The years went by, and young manhood
passed, and prosperity came; and in all that
time, though their homes lay but a few
miles apart, no word was spoken between
Macdonald and Macleod. The latter mar-
ried. lan’s wife died. The face of the
country-side altered, and still the feud lived
on.
When Neil was a little boy he took it as
a matter of course that the Macleods were
to be ignored. It seemed a romantic idea-.
But in time he, together with the young
Macleods, accepted the fend as a joke. In
fact, Willie Macleod had never forbidden
his children to speak to Neil. From Neil’s
point of view the feud was an affair between
two ageing Scotsmen ; but it was only when
he commenced his frequent visits to Mac-
leod’s house that he realised how sacred his
father held the feud. Argument followed
QUITE A. DUD.
“No, darling, I’ll certainly not sit out with Harold again.”
“Why, dearest?"
“Oh, when I aslced him why he switched off the balcony light he said he. — er—wanted to
see if his pipe was still alight ?”
argument, and Neil saw that he was inflict-
ing agony on his father.
Always Neil had reasoned calmly over
the musty affair. Macleod had admittedly
been an inconsiderate friend; but it was
impossible to believe that he had acted with
intent to do wrong. As he was now an
elderly Scot with a wife and family, Neil
liked and respected him. But old lan, with
bristling moustaches and gleaming eyes, in-
variably made answer to Neil’s protesta-
tions: “Macleod was a wild but never a
weak man. Haven’t you judgment enough
to see that, even now when you disobey me
and speak to him? Had he been a weakling
I’d have held him unworthy of hate. But
he was never weak. He ruined my brother
as only he could do. For Evan was closer
bound to him than ever to me. But for him
Evan would be with us now—aye, and your
mother, too, for she lived only three years
on; and it was the shock of that day that
began her ill-health. I can’t abide the very
name of Macleod!”
After such words the Highland blood in
Neil’s veins always warmed in answer, in
spite of his candid opinion that it was all fool-
ishness. But whatever else, the affair w T as not
his concern or Maggie’s. Any enmity was
confined to the old mountain eagle with the
bright blue eyes; and, since he had known
that he loved the girl, Neil, though often
roused to anger by his father’s threats and
warnings, had never swerved from his inten-
tion to marry her, though the action left
him penniless.
Oddly enough, all the while his heart was
wrung for his father. Wliat was his own
loss of his father's possessions when cdrri-
pared with his father's pain 1 ? . Fprgiybtiess
would never be giveii. Alone in liiS lioiise,
the old man would live With iiis agony; never
softening, as Uncompromising in twenty
years’ time as he was nOw. Awed occasion-
ally, Neil wOiiid say to himself: “What a
fearful scourge is the will of a Scotsman!”
* * * *
When the dogs barked Maggie Macleod
came to the verandah. Seeing two riders
instead of one, she opened her eyes wide.
Two bridles were flung over the picket-fence,
and two men stepped on to the verandah.
Then Maggie saw whom the second visitor
was. She hesitated, dumbfounded. Un-
easily Neil scratched his head. And decidedly
there was something fantastic in Ills father’s
standing on Macleod*s verandah, The Whole
neighborhood would have gasped to witness
such a phenomenon.
Finally Neil grinned, and “Hallo,
Maggie!” he said lightly. “You see, I’ve
brought my farther with me.”
“It’s this girl I’ll speak to,” said lan
calmly. His voice froze the flurried words
on her lips.
Neil’s vague suspicions took form; his
forebodings were intensified. He looked
keenly at his father. “Aren’t you coming
inside?” he asked.
“This will do.” lan faced the girl. “Neil
tells me you’re his girl? Is that true?”
The light from a window shone on her
face and shimmered in her hair. She colored
and looked at Neil.
“Answer, Maggie,” he said. “Don’t feel
shy of him.”
She nodded. “Yes, Mr. Macdonald ”
“I forbade him to see you,” said lan.
You shouldn’t do that. It isn’t—fair,"’
she faltered.
How much do you love him, girl?”
She blushed, looked foolish, then lifted a
chin. “I just love him, that's all.”
Then if you love him,” said lan, “you
won t see him lose all I possess. For if you
wed him I give him nought.”
Neil sprang forward and flung his arms
about her. “I knew that was coming!" he
shouted. “He tried it on me! His Scotch
pig-headedness makes him capable of any-
thing. Who cares? Give him your answer
quickly and let him go!”
, Hut With wide, tragic eyes, she was star-
ing at the old mail,
Dully she spoke, “You mean—yOu’U—dis-
inherit Neil? - ’
lan’s heart. Was leaden. His card was
tabled, and already he saw that it wduld
Prove Unbeatable. Only one listener knew
what lan was suffering then, and that list-
ener was inside the house; only the High-
land Scot, born and reared in those stern
northern regions, could appreciate the nature
of his fellow Scot —a nature that will tor-
ture itself for a resolve even after it knows
the resolve is unsound. Knowing that he
had no call to dictate to two young lives,
lan sternly hugged his sworn resolve closer
still, and his eyes were as sombre as night.
“He will be no son of mine,” he said.
Then stepped out to the verandah Willis
Macleod, with puckered brown skin and
heavy beard.
“Macdonald,*’ said he, “Consider”
The two men looked at each other. These
Wel*e the first words spoken between them
for twenty-six years. To Neil, standing back
Avith his arm about the girl, it seemed almost
humorous.
“I have nought to consider, and nought
to say to you,” said lan.
“You’ve gone over far,” said Willie.
“You’ll be sorry.”
lan maintained silence.
“You’ll be wise to give way.”
No answer.
“I’m warning you.” said Willie. “You’ll
earn pain, dark and heavy for your pride.
Will you consider, yes or no?”
“Never!” said lan fiercely.
The other pocketed his hand, withdrew
it, and offered a sheet of paper. “I’ve held
this secret even from wife and kin for many
a year, lan, man. It will give you sorrow;
but you have brought it on yourself. I
must consider the young folk you would part.
Gin you like, you can burn this. But the
dead must speak to you, since the living are
ignored.” lake lan, Macleod Avas highly
dramatic at such a moment.
With trembling hand lan took the paper
to the window. One single sheet, yellowing
with age, it was, from Evan Macdonald to
Willie Macleod. Silence brooded over the
verandah.
God knows, Willie, but you’re my good angel.
The devilish thing was ; maybe, as good as done till
you made me abhor it. I’ve thought it over all
night and 1 know I can’t do it. Don’t judge me too
harshly, AVillie. If you knew what it was to eat and
sleep in the house,* seeing her day after day, and
knowing I had only to speak to have her fly with
me, you’d understand how the idea grew on me in
spite of myself. My own brother’s wife! God be
thanked, you have brought me to my senses in time,
and I am going away while still innocent. I won’t
see you again. I’m off to Stawell in the morn-
ing, and then on the train for somewhere. Say no-
thing that vou knew I was going away. I’ll write
to lan some day, and make up a story for my sud-
den disappearance, but at present I can’t think
clear. Please God we’ll meet again, for I’ll never
have another friend like you—Love from Evan.
lan looked up, but said no word. Bend-
ing his head again, he slovvly read the letter
through a second time, as though the con-
tents had not yet reached his brain. Mac-
leod’s puckered old eyes were brimming with
tears.
“You would have spared me, Willie, said
lan at length. “I see it all now. AVillie,
I have no matches. AVill you put match to
this?”
The paper flamed, fluttered to the boards
and was not.
Macleod groaned. “You brought it on
yourself, lan.”
“I did.” He looked steadily at Neil and
Maggie, both of whom were completely be-
wildered at the course of events. “I did.
But don’t take on, man. God forgive me,
but I’m glad it was this way and not the
other. The dead are dead, and it would have
fair broken my heart to have parted my son
and the girl.”
“Aye, I felt for you, lan,” said Willie.
“You’re a grand man, Willie, and I thank
you.”
“What else could I do?” said he. “But
many’s the day and year I’ve longed for
your voice and your step in my house. This
is a grand night.” And the grey-bearded
hero grunted his pleasure. “Will you come
inside, lan, man?”
“Aye, for a while, Willie.”
* * * *
Neil was deep in thought. But he was
completely baffled.
“Maggie, dear,” said he, “your father has
out-Scotched mine, somehow. I don’t think
we’ll ever know how.”

MOTOR OIL
The hot weather is here with long days of constant work
for the car. The engine, working at an incredible speed, gives
millions of revolutions, disastrous to the finest mechanical
system, unless the lubricant is right.
Without a film of oil between the moving surfaces the
engine would soon become hot, seize and work its own
destruction.
The lubricant provides millions of oil globules, minute
ball bearings, constantly rolling between all moving parts.
Low-grade oils break down rapidly. “CASTROL,” the
better oil, remains constant even under the worst conditions.
Extremes of heat, strain and load do not affect its con-
sistency. Its molecules do not break down under the terrific
heat generated by a hard-working engine in summer time.
They take the wear instead of the metal, protecting and
preserving as no other oil will do.

“Ferrodor Elastic Paint” is composed of a Natural Metallic Powder,
found in a very fine state of division, the chemical analysis of which shows it
unaffected by the air, as further oxidation is impossible. Intense heat or cold
has no effect upon it, neither has salt, soft, hard or distilled water.
“Ferrodor” is thoroughly elastic, and never forms a flinty or unyielding coat
which would crack with expansion or vibration. It will not “chalk off ” through
exposure to rain and sun and does not blister or scale, but retains its appearance
and will last longer than any paint on the market to-day. It has been used
for many years by several of the largest firms in Australia with satisfactory
results, and affords perfect protection for all iron, steel or wood structures.

The inventive genius of Senatore Marconi, G.C.V.0., LL.D., D.Sc.; and Mr. C. S. Franklin,
the master minds of the new Beam Wireless System; the advances made in scientific radio
work by Captain H. J. Round—the man who, during the war, by means of directional wire-
less, detected the movement of the German Fleet from its anchorage in the Kiel Canal, which
knowledge enabled the Admiralty to prepare for Jutland —the creative work of all these
scientists is incorporated in AWA Radiola Receivers, the design and manufacture of which
are under the personal supervision of Mr. E. T. Fisk, Fellow 1.R.E., A.M.I.E. (Aust.),
Managing Director of Amalgamated Wireless (A/asia), Ltd.
