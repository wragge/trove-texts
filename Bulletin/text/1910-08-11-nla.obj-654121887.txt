THE RED PAGE
The Woman Question.
All men have hemiopia where women are
concerned. It is. a curious thing that the
only deeds by which women become per-
manently famous are their immoralities.
“F.M.” (“ Red Page ” 28/7/’10) talks magni-
ficently of his kind of lady—who is also La
Bruy4re’s. I wonder how much of it he
means. Does he really yearn after the
woman “ who possesses a simplicity and
natural grandeur—unassuming superiority—
and many virtues ” ? If he does, the kind of
literature he affects is rather contradictory to
his tastes. He has evidently drunk deeply
of the histories of what are called “ Frgil
Women ” —women who have the courage to
be themselves, who drop suddenly from the
“ noble attitude” adopted by Shaw’s
“Raina”! Heavens! how they shock men!
What prudes men are ; in all things excepting
their own pleasures ! The fact is that the
ordinary man (and there are, oh so many
ordinary men) has a curiously god-like attitude
with regard to women. She is to be a
being, seductive and companionable, able to
minister to his needs, full of passion and
fire—at the right moment, and yet abso-
lutely impervious (o all temptation. She
has needs of affection that he better under-
stands in a dog when he pats it. “A man
lives as long as he desires, a woman as long
as she is desirable.”
Be she strong—he despises her “cold-
ness. ” Should she yield—she has his ever-
lasting suspicion ! There are more women
to-day who satisfy men as companions and
sweethearts than there are men who satisfy
women.
The real beauty that rules men “ is lodged
in the epidermis.” Most women are charm-
ing to look at. If they are not, they treat
their faces as afflictions and endeavor to
remedy them. The woman who paints, for
instance, unhygienic as she is (and un-
savory too), is really an unconscious monu-
ment of humility and modesty. But He—
no matter how ugly! (and gods ! how ugly
he often is !) —strides the stars, unashamed,
and even unconscious—expecting with his
smug complacency the adoration and respect
of this dainty, delicate thing that is Woman,
“half angel and half bird, and all a
wonder and a wild desire ” (until you
marry her!). —v
* * * *
“F.M.” descants on the lovely Recamier
and marvels at the cleverness with which
she “ mixed Love and Intellect, making it
hard to discover where brain leaves off and
passion begins.” If he only knew it, that is
the tragedy of woman. Heights and Ex-
tremes appeal to her—that is, to the only
her worth worrying about'! She loves her
man with eyes wide open. Man always
loves woman with a mist over his eyes. No
man would marry if he were a rational lover
—as Shaw puts it—just as a perfectly
rational army would run away.
If woman could only be insane at the time
of her love, and keep her eyes shut, in all
her relations with men, she would be per-
fectly irresistible.
There is a tremendous amount of pose
between men and women. Men pretend
they love the La Bruy ere women. Yet the
world has abundance of perfectly estim-
able unmarried ladies who are absolutely full
of virtue and simplicity.
Women pretend they love the dear simple
tastes of men, and as Barrie smilingly hints,
“all the remarkable women spend their
lives in pretending to be quite ordinary.”
Most of all, they pretend to believe in the
chivalry and honor and purity and fidelity of
men. Because they know that man’s ideal
is the stupid woman
“I like a clever woman; but she must
not obtrude her brains ” ; said -a man of
brilliant intellect. “Obtrude ”is the word
in which you have man’s whole attitude!
“The woman-question drags itself into art
and literature, ” protests ‘‘ F. M. ” Of course
it does ! Woman is Art. She is the most
artful and artistic thing in the world. She
alone appeals to man through all his senses.
When she is beautiful, can you imagine any-
thing more beautiful, or more completely
artistic. Men were only invented to protect
and minister to the needs of Nature’s master-
piece.
“F.M.” can endure “lawlessness but not
levity.” Recamier has his respect, although
“she was the greatest flirt in the world””
But Catherine the Great hurts him by her
absence of coquetry. She simply “beck-
oned the . better-shaped corporals into her
heart with dreadful monotony ! ” She* was
perfectly masculine in her methods. Only the
exceptional man ever beckons a woman into
his heart for any other reason. Why should
a thing which is only the ordinary habitude
of a man be so shocking in a woman ? Man
wants to eat his cake and have it. He
wants her to sit up on a chilly pedestal—but
to be quite ready to hop down when he
whistles.
* * •* *
The Marquise de Courcelles writes to her
lover of her “well-cut mouth and shapely
legs. “This is not edifying,” complains
Saint-Beuve. Yet possibly the lady (who
was not a modern poseuse) wrote to her lover
of what interested him most. She knew how
necessary it was not to bore him—so she
pretended to be silly. Doubtless her legs
interested him far more than her intellect.
They usually do. Again, one speaks of
ordinary men ! You, dear sir—and you, and
y°u are all exceptional. You all married
your wives for their brains and their sweet,
simple natures —and you apre all dreadfully
happy and contented ! Really—men would
be bearable only for their virtues !
HELEN JEROME.
Mary Gilmore
A place has been waitings on many an
Australian bookshelf for a volume which
would contain the scattered verses of Mary
Gilmore. Some of them have been fre-
quently reprinted here and abroad, and
many are treasured in scrap-book or
memory. The best are published at last in
book form (by Geo. Robertson and Co., at
3s. 6d.), and are assured of a wide welcome.
The selection is a good one, but there is no
logical order in the arrangement. The title
— Marri’d and Other Verses —is appropriate,
for “ Marri’d ” is the best of the verses in
the form she uses most effectively, and the
joys of wifehood and motherhood have in-
spired her finest work.
When writing as 4 ‘M.J.C.” for The
Bulletin and other papers before her humani-
tarian enthusiasm led her to Paraguay and
matrimony, she often assumed the attitude
of the man. Many gii-ls have done the same
in their verses, but few would have ex-
pressed a man’s idea of “the truest mate ”
as in the lines reprinted in another column.
“ Good-night ” was written in that time ;
also “A Little Ghost, ” which has a touch of
mystery not common in Mary Gilmore’s
work. Instead we have the note which
appears in “The Child” :
I saw a face to-day, dear,
A face I never knew ;
Beloved, its eyes they haunt me,
They pierce me through and through.
For they were mine, my darling,
My eyes, my sin, my shame ;
And as they flashed before me
They scorched me like a flame.
I think if you were mine, dear,
Mine though we sware no oath,
You would go out and find him,
And So redeem us both ;
You would go out and find him,
Ana, finding, bring him in,
And hide him in your bosom,
Till God forgot the sin.
Love trusts, forgives, redeems—-that is the
philosophy of Mary Gilmore. And love of
the gude man and the bairn suffices ; hence
“ I gang nae mair t’ lecture ha’.”
I gang nae mail-1’ lecture ha’;
I sit nae mair ’neath Mistress Scott;
I mak’ a denner jist f’r twa,
An’ sit beside a bairnie’s cot.
I write, nae mair, discourses grave
O’ things ’at mak gude bodies stare;
I sit me doon an’ lilt a stave
To please a bairn that asks .nae mair.
I speir nae questions, noo, o’ life—
Why that is sae, an’ that, an’ this !
I bide contentit jist a wife
Wi’ ane dear bairn t’ guide an’ kiss.
But that is not all. All roads lead to love
with her. Her own happiness makes her
grieve keenly for those who have been denied
or have lost the same opportunity, and makes
her fight with untiring pen in the war of
liberation.
The Scottish dialect comes naturally to a
daughter of Highlanders ; but Mary Gil-
more usually writes in English; often
and very effectively in the language of
plain people who are not regardful of the
niceties of speech. Something would be lost
if lines like these were put into correct
English :
•I’se weary in-’, I is
Achin’through an’through;
I’se wearyin’, I is
Wearyin’ for you.
Us is out, her ’n’ me,
Just like utter fools;
Bustin’-achin’ f’r a word,
Obstinit as mules.
What would be lost is the familiar homely
note—that which makes The Biglow Papers
stand out in American literature, and makes
“The Courtin’” one.of its brightest gems.
Some of her child songs have the same
charm as the Plantation melodies and the
dialect verse of Whitcomb Riley. They com-
municate irresistibly the singer’s delight,
and should be popular. 0 ’
There is little 'artifice in Mary Gilmore’s
verse. Her imagination does not soar
very high. Such imagery as she uses is
stereotyped—<a road, for instance, is likened
to a ribbon on two occasions. The verses
come from the heart rather than the head.
The songs seem to have fashioned them-
selves spontaneously on simple airs, and
have all the strength of sincere emotion.
Marri’d and Other Verses finds an honored
place on the shelf, beside the books of Jessie
Mackay and Henry Lawson.

Mrs. Campbell Praed has no special in-
terest for Australians now. Her early tales
of Australian life are near oblivion, and she
has been so long away that the relationship
is almost forgotten. But one who reads her
annual volume to see how she is getting on
finds occasionally that the book is worth
while for its own sake. The latest is one of
the best. It follows a current fashion in
taking a true story from literary history as a
skeleton.
The Circassian girl bought in the slave
market of Constantinople by a compassion-
ate ambassador, brought up in Paris as his
daughter, and known as Mademoiselle Ai'ssfe,
is one of those romantic figures which are
fairly numerous in French history. She had
great beauty and wit; her father by adop-
tion was wealthy; she knew most of the
famous men of the time, and she remained
pure in an atmosphere of corruption. It is
true that she gave herself to a man she
loved ; but she rejected Orleans, the Regent,
and many others Who thought an ex-slave
fair game. She became devout in middle age
and repented of her one lapse. Her letters,
written to a confidante, owe much of their
interest to her frank self-questioning on the
subject of her frailty. Gosse has written of
them in French Profiles:
If Aiss& can no more pretend to possess the
breadth of vision and rich imagination of Madame
de S4vigne than to command the incomparable
accent of passion which cries through the corre-
spondence of Mademoiselle de L’Espinasse, she
has qualities which are not unworthy to be named
with these—an exquisite sincerity, an observation-
of men and things which could hardly be more
picturesque, a note of pensive and thilling tender-
ness, and a candor which melts the very soul to
pity.
Mrs. Campbell Praed, who does not think
much of the Letters, has elaborated the
story in The Romance of Mdlle. A'isse (John
Long). She has given the facts an attractive
dress of fiction, and made the Circassian
slave girl live again.
Eusapia Paliadino
The case of Eusapia Palladino is so re-
markable that anything written about her
attracts attention. There have been other
mediums of whom astonishing things have-
been told and believed ; and Podmore, Hey-
singer and others have collected the records
of persons who were said to be temporarily
operated upon or possessed by super-normal
powers before the days of professional
mediums. Belief in these powers rests on
the authority of people who were either only
too ready to believe or did not take measures
to preclude the. possibility of fraud. There
is the famous Mrs. Piper, still living, who
convinced Francis Myers, Sir Oliver Lodge
and others. She is a trance-medium through
whom messages are supposed to come from
the dead. In her case the interest is in the
message rather than the woman. Eusapia
produces physical phenomena—shifts the
furniture, rings bells, and causes spirit bodies
to appear without personal contact. Her
case is unique in this''respect —she has been
subjected to careful investigation over a
period of 20 years in various countries and
by a great variety of people Some eminent
scientists who have watched herclosely believe
her to be genuine. Lombroso, a hard-shelled
sceptic, was completely converted, and recon-
structed his views of nature on the strength
of Eusapia’s performances. The statements
made by Lombtoso in After Death—What ?
form the greatest triumph any medium has
achieved.
Yet Eusapia has on many occasions been
bowled out as a trickster of an exceptionally
clever kind. The most recent exposure is
reported fully in Collier's Weekly (U.S.A.)
for 14th May last. Is she a fraud all through,
or has she really at odd times produced phe-
nomena which upset the recognised laws of
nature?
Hereward Carrington attempts to answer
these questions in Eusapia Palladino and
her Phenomena (Sydney Bc/ok Club). Car-
rington was an amateur conjurer who had
detected trickery in many other mediums,
and had never seen one genuine manifesta-
tion of the physical order until he met
Eusapia. He refers to the stances at Cam-
bridge in 1895, when Eusapia was found
guilty of fraud again and again—“fraud of a
kind which necessitated the supposition that
the medium had practised it long and care-
fully.” He believes that in his own
and many other investigations it was
impossible for Eusapia to humbug the
audience, though he frankly states that
she would trick her sitters whenever allowed
to do so. He gives a detailed account of
all the important seances held by Eusapia,
and his own hypothesis to account for the
“ facts ” —which is the spiritistic theory. He
regards her case as a crucial one. If Eusapia
is bogus, then there is nothing in the whole
business.
Of course it would be absurd to say
that such phenomena are impossible ; but
the phenomena are trivial, and they are pro-
duced only in the dark, and with a cabinet
at the back of the medium. Faith in the
medium depends upon the authority of
scientists, who are as gullible as other men.
As Carrington says in his preface : “We
should always have to assume that fraud was
the real explanation of the facts so long as
it was possibly operative ” —and if unques-
tionably operative in many cases, there
is the suspicion that it may have been
operative in all. That Eusapia is possessed
of abnormal psychic powers is undoubted,
and even for sleight of hand and foot work
she is extraordinarily clever ; but she is not
a sufficiently sound foundation for the whole
edifice of spiritualism.
Verses by Mary Gilmore
MARRID.
It’s singin’ in an’ out
An’ round about the place.
Here an’ there, an’ up an’ down,
An’ feelin’ full o’ grace.
It’s rollin’ up your sleeves,
An’ whit’nin’ up the hearth.
An’ scrubbin’ out the floors.
An’ sweepin’ down the path ;
It’s bakin’ tarts an’ pies,
An’ shinin’ up the knives,
An’ feelin’. ’s if some days
Was worth a thousand lives.
It’s watchin’ out the door
An’ watchin’ by the gate,
An’ watchin’ down the road—
An’ wondVn’ why he’s late.
An’ feelin’ anxious like,
For fear there’s something wrong,
An’ wond’rin’ if he’s kep’,
An’ why he takes so long.
It’s cornin’ hack inside,
An’ sittin’ down a spell,
To sorter make believe
You’re thinkin’ things is well;
It’s gettin’ up again,
An’ wand’rin’ in an’ out,
And feelin’ wistful like,
Not thinkin’ what about.
An’ flushin’ all at once,
An’ smilin’ jes’ so sweet,
An’ bein’ real proud
The house is nice an’ neat; ,;
An’ feelin’ awful glad,
Like them that watched Silo’m—
An’ everything because
A man is cornin’ Home.
THE TRUEST MATE.
I don’t know whether ’tis well to love,
Or whether ’tis well to hate,
But I know this well, that the man who has sinned
Is ever the truest mate.
For the man who has sinned his sins himself,
And learned what a n.an may learn,
Is wiser than he who has lived untried
By the fires that make, or burn.
He knows the needs of the human heart,
The want in another’s will.
And sees excuse where the untried man
Sees only the love of ill. '
He sees the good and he sees the bad,
And judges these two between,
And he knows the thing that counts for moat
- Is sekiom the thing that’s seen.
For one may know what- a man has done,
But who how a man has tried?
And who shall say if a man go straight
Fur purity’s sake, or pride?
And who shall say if a sinner sin
For love of the sin or no ;
Or whether he drift in ignorance
Of the things that a man should know ?
I don’t know whether ’tis well to love,
Or whether ’tis Well to hate,
But I know this well, that the man who has sinned
Is ever the truest mute.
TIME WAITS NOT.
Time waits not on our idle days,
The balance ever forward swings ;
Life goes, impatient, while we wait’
And takes again the hour he brings.
Love-red and quick he faces us ;
Shall we turn back and bid him go,
To wait till Time has cooled his cheek
And set his bounding pulses slow ?
Come then, Beloved, when the day
Sinks golden to the waiting west.
Time will not wait for us ; come then,
The hours shall die upon thy breast.

KEEP YOUR HEALTH.
THIS MEDICINE LENGTHENS LIFE.
A WOMAN’S LIFE-STORY
Women who suffer from the pangs of indigestion or dyspepsia should carefully read this
document, as it is true in every particular, and tells them how they can be also cured :
Clements Tonic, Ltd.
“ I think it my duty to inform you that for seven
weeks in December, 1909, and a part of January, 1910, I
was so ill that I could not take anything but biscuits and
milk-food, my appetite and digestion were so bad. I tried
several bottles of medicine from local chemists, and also
tried several standard remedies uselessly.
“ My husband, who is employed on one of the A.U.S.N.,
steamers, running to the South Sea Islands, was advised
by one of the ship’s officers to induce me to try Clements
Tonic. Acting on the advice given, I did so, and lam glad
to say that I am so thoroughly cured that I can eat any-
thing and am in splendid health. The first bottle did me
good, but the second and third (I only had need to take
three) gave me such splendid health that all the neighbors
marvelled to see me walking about a healthy woman again.
I cannot praise it too highly ; in my opinion it is a wonder-
ful medicine. I did not think it was such a good tonic,
but I am satisfied by my health to-day it is worth its
weight in gold to women who suffer from indigestion and
nervous prostration as I did.
Witness: W. BitoWN, J.P., Balmain. (Signed) U /\GNES IYIO/fLOCKm”
Mrs. Morlock lives at No. 4 Ann Street, Balmain, where she is a living testimony to
this great medicine. It is unequalled for the relief of stomach and liver troubles, and its
timely use will prevent many slight functional ailments from developing into serious
organic diseases. All chemists and stores sell Clements Tonic; send for it to-day.

BLED TO DEATH
♦
NOBODY KNEW FIRST-AID.
4
MELBOURNE, Wednesday.
In the absence of the knowledge of the prin-
ciples of first-aid by those about him, Thomas
Howland, farmer, 50 years of age, bled to death
to-day at his home, four miles from Dimboola.
Howland knocked an ulcerous sore and burst a
varicose vein near the ankle. His daughter
attempted to stanch the bleeding by applying
flour, but this had no effect, and he died within
10 minutes.
The above news item will serve to show how fallacious
is the opinion held by many sufferers from Varicose
Veins that they are “ really not dangerous.”
If you suffer from Varicose Veins, or have a relation or
friend who does, and if the veins should burst, would you
know what to do ? Let us send you an illustrated free
book describing Varicose Veins in all their forms, the
methods to adopt injsandaging, and the course to pursue
if they should burst* This book also fully describes the
Vecsey Method of treating and curing Varicose Veins
without operations.
To sufferers from Varicose Veins the Vecsey Method of
Treatment comes as a great boon. Previous to its dis-
covery no painless, permanent palliative was known.
It cures the veins absolutely, and once cured they do
not return.
Do not fail to send for our free book, which gives full
information and particulars. Post free to any address
upon receipt of 2d. stamp. Call for free advice.

The Mothers Woman.
Listen ! You’ll hear all the hearts of the women
Beating and throbbing, and loving and grieving ;
Sounding their music, so holy and human—
Children grown-up and in man still believing !
Man ! You, the strong one, whose Life has no
need of her,
If you but knew of the things she can feel !
So little she asks—and you had your full meed of
her !
Tread not the soft breast that’s under your heel!
Fluttering Life that beat under the heart of her,
Patiently borne in untellable pain ;
Grown to full manhood, and still more a part of
her,
Lightly you leave her ! Nor see her again !
Silent she yearns in that night-watch of Mothers;
Wonders—and aches for the man-child for-
getting.
Ah, for her heart! and the millions of others !
Hoping at sunrise—and silent at setting !

HELEN JEROME.
Flights of Fancy.
One flight of stairs, where everything began ;
A kiss but half-intended, an unabashed young
man;
A mumbled introduction, a confidence or two ;
A dumb interrogation: “ What sort of girl are
you ?”
What sort of girl ? I wonder how many love-
affairs
Begin with just that question at the bottom of
the stairs !
Two flights of stairs—two people at the foot
Who would not yield to Providence, and stay
where they were put;
A .dim,.deserted cloak-room ; a waiting matinee;
Intoxicating perfume ; two dewy eyes of grey :
“O, quick ! There goes the curtain”—but lips
to lips are set,
And someone rashly promises: “ I’ll make you
love me yet! ”
Three flights of stairs—l wonder if they note
The absences of someone in a veil and overcoat?
I wonder if the janitor by any chance has spied
The flap of broken plaster where a latchkey used
to hide ?
I wonder if it is “ To Let,” that office up above,
Too small for making money in, but not for
making love ?
No lease we know can bind it; no rental may
obtain
That fixity of tenure which once we hoped to
gain ;
Beyond my power to purchase, beyond your skill
to buy
The tears that tamed and taught you, the kiss
that made you cry—
But, by a dreamland doorway, stands someone who
despairs
Of hearing someone’s footfall on an empty flight
of stairs.
VICTORIA.
KETTLEDRUM.
Plaint of the (Apparently) Passion-Drowned.
The Y.M.C.A. prays in vain, and women, cold
and sainted,
Raising white, rounded arms to me implore me
to return.
But I have kissed the Siren’s lips, and I with sin
am tainted ;
Deep down beneath my fancy vest volcanic
passions burn.
Yes, I must go,
Yet dare not count the cost.
(My amiable delusion is that I am Fast and Lost.)
Shy flappers shrink before my gaze and maiden
aunts get huffy.
What matters it to me? The Past is dead
beyond a doubt;
I tried to ope my heart to one. She said the
room was stuffy,
And did not seem at ned to hear my
story out.
I had to go ;
I hate her now because
She did not give me half a chance to tell how bad
I was.

GARDEN RAKE.
Nocturne.
The moon is a silver bubble,
And the sky is a painted wall;
A dark cow chews in the stubble,
And a plough-horse stamps in his stall.
The sea is a plain unbounded,
And the moon-track a road of white;
A ship by the light surrounded
Wanders off like a sable night.
The sick man, silent and haggard,
Watches the clock’s white face,
For Time is a graceless laggard
Who moves at a funeral pace.
The candle burns to the socket.
And the shadows rise in a flood ;
The gold of an open locket
Gleams red like a saucer of blood.
He watches the flames diminish,
Till the darkness engulfs the text—
And hereabouts I must finish.
For I’m dashed if I know what’s next.

Time Has Proved
that nothing terminates life in the aged so quickly and so surely as rus .'s active —if your power and vigor are waning, if
you have no inclination for work or . pleasure, if despondent, languid or weak, Wincarnis will bring new life, create pure rich
vitalising blood, build up new tissues, new nerve force, and with these new strength of body and brain. Wincarnis starts
by checking all waste of strength and renews the lost vitality that Nature needs for perfect health, fortifying every organ of
the body to ward off ill-health and disease. Give
WINCARNIS
a trial. Its remarkable power of imparting strength and vigor is quickly apparent. In this age of rivalry and rush mankind
has very little rest, and must therefore suffer from the ill effects of overwork, both of body arid brain ; but if Wincarnis is
taken systematically these ill effects are counteracted and speedily vanish, “Swifter than blood decays,” building up with
surprising readiness the lost vitality in Nature’s delicate organism.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tun Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, tn an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
Jt is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor. Bullutin,” is the proper
superscription for “ropy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

THIJitiSDAY, AUGUST 11, 1910.
AGAIN THE GHOST OF CONGESTION.
A FEW days ago it was proposed to build a tram-
line to Little Coogee, a promising suburb outside
Sydney, and the long-enduring official worm
turned with curses in its mouth. It didn't object
on the ground that the line wasn’t wanted, nor
did it object on the ground that the line wasn’t
likely to pay. The complaint of officialdom was
that it is unsafe to build one extra yard of tram-
way track anywhere around congested Sydney,
and that it is practically impossible to put one
extra train-car' on the Sydney lines. The limit
of safety lias not only been reached ; it has
already been passed. And, in truth, the fact is so
visible to the naked eye that a lot of mere ama-
teurs noticed it a long while ago. It is only
necessary to ride along George-street any day about
noon, and the evidence is lying around in heaps.
The car, as a rule, makes three separate stoppages
at the King-street corner—or possibly five. First
it pulls up with a nerve-wracking jolt, because
there are two cars stopping in front of it. Then
the first car gets away, and the second one moves
forward to the corner, and the third one bangs
and jolts up behind. Next, the second car gets
away, and the one that was third gets in motion
and brings up with a wallop at the correct
stopping place, and by this time there are probably
two or three or five more cars taking jumping
exercise behind it. to the great detriment of their
passengers. At a busy time of day a car has to
dodge across King-street at least every eight
seconds in order to prevent a block forming. A
breakdown; that lasts only five minutes means
the accumulation of about half a mile of
cars and half a mile of curses. At the
remote, outlandish and utterly m«xo rail-
way station things are, if possible, worse.
During the busy hours of the morning, when
Commerce is struggling towards its office, it only
requires an accidental delay of a minute or two,
and this is the situation : Car I. is just getting
away with a load that ought to get the manage-
ment a £lO fine for overcrowding; car 11., look-
inglike an anthill on wheels, is panting to get
away; cars 111., IV., V. and VI., all black with
passengers, are waiting their chance to flee into the
city ; and respectable, sober, elderly gentlemen are
making a football scrum in their efforts to get
into car VII., while young men are running to
intercept car VIII. and peg out a claim early.
And at the other end of the metropolis the ferry
steamers are behaving with almost exactly the
same measure of madness and incompetence, and
getting tangled up with mail steamers to boot.
* * * *
Sydney, in truth, is “ up against it.” Its sins
of omission and commission, of selfishness and
greed and monopoly have come home to roost, and
the perch is breaking down beneath the weight of
evil fowl that try to sit on it. Sydney has no
suburban railways save at the north and south.
The great and populous eastern, south-eastern,
north-eastern and western suburbs—Paddington,
Double Bay, Woollahra, Waverley, Bondi,
Coogee, Botany, Waterloo, Glebe, Balmain,
Drummoyne, Manly, etc. —are no better provided
for, in this respect, to-day than they were in the
times of Captain Cook. Sydney has no railway
through the city on the surface level, in which
respect it is almost the most backward place of
its size on earth. It has no overhead railway, as
Glasgow and New York have, to supplement its
tramway system. It has no underground rail-
ways like those of London and Paris to relieve
the pressure on its streets. There isn’t a single
bridge across the harbor, nor is there a single tunnel
under it. The streets are narrow, which is bad ;
and insanely crooked, which is almost worse, and—
what is probably the worst of all—they have such
a weird habit of converging into each other that
there are really only two practicable and reason-
ably direct entrances into the city—one by George-
street West and one by Oxford-street. There is
no Greater Sydney Council with power to plan a
comprehensive rebuilding programme. Nothing
really comprehensive can be done without the
consent of about 40 councils and as many mayors
and about 700 aldermen. Municipal government
is so crippled by all this division and dissension,
that the tramway management has been put of
necessity in the hands of the Railway De-
partment ; water and sewerage are controlled
by boards appointed by the central authority ;
and the gas supply, hydraulic power supply and
ferry services are owned, at stupendous loss to the
community, by Private Enterprise. These are
great misfortunes to the city, which loses much
revenue in consequence ; but as two-score sets of
municipal or parish Bumbles can’t be expected to
co-operate intelligently for the management of
anything, the misfortunes are unavoidable. The
railway services are crippled by the fact that
each of the two lines brings up at a dead
en( j_one at North Shore, separated from
what should be its destination by the harbor;
and the other near Red fern, separated from
the business portion of the city by a mile of
tangled streets. Therefore, much shunting has
to be done in confined spaces which are wholly
unfitted for that kind of work, and there are
grievous muddlesanddelays in consequence. Also,
the city happens to lie on a narrow peninsula,
which is partly the work of Providence. Its
goods traffic is mostly concentrated in a narrow
space on the shores of Darling Harbor, which is
partly the work of Providence and mostly the
doing of man. And its freight and passenger
traffic is mostly shoved through the narrow and
wholly inadequate Redfern tunnel, which looks
like the work of the Devil.
* * * *
An official report, which came to hand a few
days ago, revealed the fact that there were, on
December 31, 1909, 92,209 persons employed
in N.S.W. factories, as compared with
60,779 on the same date in the year 1900.
Owing to the centralisation and congestion
policy which has always been followed in N.S.W.,
more than two-thirds of these employees are
in Sydney; and; apparently it is intended that two-
thirds, more if possible, of the inevitable
future increase shall be in Sydney. This branch
of the congestion evil is increasing. To give the
exact figures: in 1899, 61 per cent, of N.S.W.’s
factory employees were in the one big;city and 39
per cent, in the country and the smaller towns ;
while in 1909 over 68 per cent, were in Sydney
and less than 32 per cent, elsewhere. The indus-
trial workers of Sydney increased by 26,758
between 1899 and 1908; those in all the
rest of the State, their industries hampered
by specially heavy and antagonistic rail-
way rates, increased by only 6694. What
the city transit arrangements will be like
when the factory employees number 200,000 is a
matter for interesting speculation. Things won’t
be simply made twice as bad as they are, hut four
or five times as bad ; for as warehouses and fac-
tories take the place of dwelling-houses in the
city the worker is driven further and further out,
and has to depend more on tram-cars and trains,
and lesson the more or less shapeless means of
locomotion handed out to him by an all-wise
Providence. The population inside the Sydney
metropolitan area is now set down at 665,000,
and last week it was officially estimated
that by the year 1928 it will proba-
bably be 1,264,000. What the racket and
shindy at the corner of George and King
streets are likely to resemble in 1928, unless there
is a gigantic reconstruction and reorganisation in
the interval, the prophetic eye of man cannot
discern. The oversea trade of N.S.W. promises
this year to reach £50,000,000, as against a mere
£34,000,000 11 years ago. The increase has been
practically all at Sydney ; in fact, such elaborate
devices have been used to kill every other port
fitted for foreign shipping that the outports have
less trade than they had in 1899—barring only
Newcastle, which, by reason of its coal deposits,
can’t be utterly suppressed. Yet Sydney has
made no special preparation to meet this rush of
new business, nor is it making any special pre-
paration to meet the future increase.
* * * *
What the semi-paralysed Government proposes
to do in the matter, beyond keeping Peter Bowl-
ing in gaol, is not very clear. The extension of
the main line through the city, the building of
the North Sydney bridge and tunnel (possibly
two bridges and two tunnels will be neces-
sary) and th'e very essential bridge to con-
nect Sydney with Balmain, the construction
of the overhead or underground suburban
railway system—they all seem just about as
adjacent as they did 40 years ago. There is still
no Greater Sydney, no comprehensive scheme for
the reconstruction of the metropolis, no attempt
even to do such a snujll job as the removal
of the Private Enterprise gasworks from
their perch on the water side to make
room for new wharfage. Certainly there is talk of
destroying certain hideously overcrowded slums
about Surry Hills and Chippendale—places where
houses face on to alleged highways 20ft., 10ft.,
and even as little as 3ft. wide. That is a most
Commendable idea; but every time a city slum is
destroyed people (ire compelled to move further
and further out, and if these people are employed
in the city—which they presumably are, else they
wouldn’t dwell in the aforesaid slums —and can’t
get into the city, then the latter end of them may
be even worse than the first. .To reconstruct and
refit Sydney so as to make it even moderately
adapted to carry the trade that the centralisation
policy of the State is forcing into it, would pro-
bably cost £50,000,000 at the very least—possibly
£80,000,000 would be nearer the mark. It would
doubtless be money well spent so far as Syd-
ney is concerned, but the chances are that
the far northern and far southern sections
of the State would secede and set up for them-
selves—legally or illegally—rather than con-
tribute to such an outlay. To them Sydney is
merely a curse, an octopus and an oppressor. It
is for the sake of Sydney that they are not
allowed to use their own handy and convenient
ports, and that they are compelled to pay railway
freight over such vast, needless distances that
they are almost beggared by the superfluous ex-
pense. It is also for the sake of Sydney that
there is no big coastal city in the north or south
to which the adjacent people can occasionally re-
sort to rub off the raw edges of their isolation.
Their towns are little better than hamlets,
occasionally visited by a damaged picture show
or a frayed little dramatic co. playing some
tenth-rate Shock, and they are fairly well
aware that the metropolitan octopus is the cause.
If these people learned that a huge new burden
was to be laid upon them in order to repair
and enlarge the octopus, and to postpone
the day when the absolute bursting of the con-
gestion policy would compel the opening up of
their own ports, the upheaval would almost cer-
tainly be something of a kind that N.S.W. hasn’t
seen in all its history.
*■ * * »
Yet the utterly incompetent Wade Govern-
ment apparently intends to stick to the policy of
dragging everything to Sydney—or to stick as
closely to it as possible. Certainly, there is a De-
centralisation Commission out admiring thescenery
in various places, but that is mere conversation
and superfluous affability. The railway rates are
still so devised as to encourage the northern trade
to go past Newcastle and on to Sydney, though
Sydney is 100 miles further away. The plan
of the new North Coast railway still shows that
remarkable inland deviation which is to prevent
it touching the deep water harbor of Port
Stephens. The scrap of line that would connect
the northern and north-western lines with Port
Stephens isn’t mentioned in the Government pro-
gramme. The very few miles of cheap railway
which are required to connect Berrigan with
Tocumwal, and thus give Western Biverina an
outlet to its nearest port, Melbourne, are neither
built nor proposed. The only thing that is
actually doing is the laying in great haste of dupli-
catelines for thebringingof goodsto Sydney. It was
a remarkable sign of the times that a Sydney Tory
daily should have recently published a map show-
ing a number of proposed new railways, and that,
according to this map, even if the neglected out-
ports received railway connection, the lines were
to be so artistically faked as to attach to each of
them only a little patch of territory immediately
adjacent. They were beautifully circuitous and
carefully selected railways, whereby a place that
was 100 miles as the crow flies from, say, Twofold
Bay, might easily find itself 350 miles away as the
proposed iron road went. The recently-published
official estimate that the population of Sydney is
to double in the next 18 or 20 years is also plainly
based on a firm official assurance that the
congestion policy and the needless haulage have
come to stay. If the north and south are to
be allowed free and complete access to their
own good ports, and N.S.W. is to have, say, four
coastal cities instead of one, then Sydney will
still grow ; but so enormous and sudden a bloating
as is foreshadowed in these calculations is not to
be looked for. But officialdom has so little belief
in the bona-fides of the Decentralisation Commis-
sion that it is planning to tap the Warragamba river
—the last possible source of water supply—so as to
be ready in good time for the congested million
and a quarter people who are to come almost im-
mediately. There is only one possible end to this
insane policy, and that is plain, unvarnished
separation—the breakage of N.S.W. into, pro-
bably, four States. When the question of the
reconstruction of Sydney arises, the Separation
question will almost certainly rise with it. And
good authorities seem to reckon that unless John-
son can devise a flying tramcar, the reconstruction
problem can’t be kept down much longer.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The N.S.W. Superannuation Fund.
It may be taken for granted that the N.S.W.
Government’s proposed superannuation fund for
railway and tramway employees will secure a
good many votes for Gregory Wade and his
friends at the approaching election, but exactly
how much these votes will cost is another matter.
Certainly the scheme is gorgeous in its liberality,
but it is possible for a thing to be so liberal to the
people who receive the money that a sort of mad-
ness comes upon the people who have to find the
money, and as soon as they realise the true inward-
ness of the case they rise in revolt. The Go-
vernment proposes to deduct percent, from the
pay, salary, or remuneration of each railway and
tramway official. This cash is to be the founda-
tion of the fund. In return each official is to
get a pension when he retires at the age
of 60, or if he retires before that age through
disability. If he resigns his job before he
is due for his pension, he is to get back
the money he has paid, and if he dies pre-
maturely the money he has paid is to go to his
widow. For the officer who hangs out till the
age of 60 the pension arrangements are fairly
lavish. If he has been a contributor to the fund
for 20 years he is to get, every year for the rest
of his life, one-third of the average salary he
earned during; his term of contribution; after 30
years his pension is to amount to half his salary ;
after 40 years to two-thirds of his salary. Thus
if a man enters the service at the age of 20, and
starts to draw his pension at the age of 60, and
earns, on an average. £2OO a year in the nltenm,
he will pay into the fund £l2O in ali. If it is
possible for him to stare at £2OO a year,
and earn the same £2OO all the time,
then he will subscribe a steady £3 per annum, and
his contributions, with compound interest at 3£
per cent., will represent £253 13s. But as he
starts with a small salary and a very small con-
tribution, it isn’t likely that the most enthusiastic
process of compound interest will make his actual
payment to the fund worth more than £2OO.
When he retires he will proceed to draw a pension
of £133 6s. Bd, per annum. In other words, his
own contributions to the fund will provide for ms
pension for 11 years.. If he lives to the age of 80,
then for 181, years his pension is to come out of
the public revenue. Taking the average duration
of life and the average chances of the game, it is
calculated that the railway and tramway officials
are to provide one-sixth of their pension fund and
the general taxpayer is to provide the other
five-sixths. How much the general taxpayers
liability may amount to no one knows, for
on one can tell to what extent the railway
and tramway services may grow, and* how many
pensioners there may ultimately be. It_is all a
leap in the dark. Once every year the deficit in
the fund is to be estimated, and the gaping void
is to be made good out of the State revenue. If
this scheme can secure to the Government any-
thing even dimly resembling a block vote from the
railway and tramway service next October, and
if that large inert institution, the general tax-
payer, doesn’t give way to sudden anger before
October, the present Ministry will probably get
back to office. But the outlook for those who are
to benefit by the superannuation fund isn’t neces-
sarilv as good as it looks. It is all very well for
Premier Wade to offer them liberal terms at the
expense of the rest of the community, the
bill to be paid in futurity ; but a time must
come when the rest of the community will
realise that it has a very considerable burden to
carry. And then nothing can prevent the rest of
the community arising in anger and abolishing
the whole business. No Act that the Wade
Government can sho\e through Parliament to-day
will put the proposed superannuation fund on a
firm basis, if that fund depends on an excessive
looting of the taxpayer of the future. The tax-
payer of the future can always refuse to be looted.
An Explanation.
That rather surprising provision in the Austra-
lian Notes Bill whereby a bank is to be compelled
to make payments up to £25 in any kind of notes
that may be demanded, created so much fuss that
Prime Minister Fisher felt called upon to rise
hurriedly and appear for the defendant. His
statement was to the general effect that the idea
was neither new, unusual nor untried —that it
was, in fact, copied from the Canadian Banking
Act, and therefore had solid experience behind it.
The explanation might have been a good deal
more convincing without bursting its boiler
through the pressure of internal logic. In
Canada Government notes are issued for
165., Bs., 4s. and one solitary “bob” (reckon-
ing the dollar roughly at 45.), so they con-
stitute the small change of the country. Any
one who is- drawing money from a bank can
demand to be paid up to £2O in one, two or four
dollar Government notes. The Fisher Govern-
ment’s proposal is that he mav demand payment
up to £25 (not £2O) in 10s., £1 or £5 notes, or he
may call for two £lO notes, or one £2O note. The
Canadian policy allows the customer to insist on
being paid in any one of three different kinds of
Government paper, and these the small, everyday
currency that every office must keep on hand,
just as in Australia it must keep some shillings
and a few sixpences. The Fisher idea would give
him the option of demanding payment in five dif-
ferent kinds of currency, and would compel the
keeping of a dead stock of £lO and £2O notes
at obscure branches where such things are not
really wanted more than once in a blue moon. The
Canadian system requires a small banking show to
keep in stock, in addition to three different de-
nominations of notes, some gold and silver, but as
the notes to a great extent take the place of silver
no very large quantity of the white metal is neces-
sary. The proposed Australian method would
involve the keeping, in addition to five different
denominations of notes, of much more silver than
in Canada, because the 10s. and 20s. notes
wouldn’t take the place of metal to the same
extent as the 4s. and Bs. ones, it seems a clumsy
arrangement, and not calculated for the special
benefit of anybody save bush-burglars. Their
chances ought to be improved by a method which
will necessitate the keeping of so much extra cash
in the shoddy little buildings which serve for
banking premises in the backblocks. If the
Fisher Government wants to borrow ideas from
Canada it would be better advised to copy that
proviso which compels the keeping of two-fifths
of every bank’s cash reserves in Government paper.
It is plain, simple and to the point, and it gets
there every time.
The Curse of Land-hunger.
“F.C.” has lately been over the Mallee :
When, in 1895, Victoria woke to the fact that its Mallee
country was anything but the desert land it was supposed
to be, and, though troubled by occasional droughts, was
in reality fine wheat-growing soii, the State Parliament
passed some legislation specially dealing with it. In
doing so the Legislature wisely provided that the maxi-
mum selectable area should be 1920 acres for first-class
land, 3000 for second-class, 3840 for third-class, and 4800
for fourth-class ; and that no person could be the bene-
ficial holder of more than three times the maximum
selectable area. The restrictions were generous, not
to say lavish; but behind them was the inten-
tion to have the land occupied, and not locked up as
grazing paddocks. Unfortunately, having made its laws,
Parliament promptly disremembered them ; and success-
ive Lands Ministers enthusiastically followed suit. Con-
sequently the Mallee wheat-lands are being steadily
converted into sheep-runs, huge holdings are taking the
place of farms, and the State’s alleged policy of settling
the people on the land is being made a fool of. On this
subject the Melbourne Age recently spoke an interesting
piece. Last year two large Mallee estates —Swanwater
and Rich Avon—-were cut up and sold ; but in every
case the blocks were acquired by local farmers, and the
pseudo-subdivision brought not one new settler into the
district. The same process goes on around Warrackna-
beal, Nhill, Charlton and other north-western and
northern townships. Holdings now owned by one man
were formerly occupied by 10 or 12 farmers apiece.-Cope
Cope is an instance. Thirty years ago there were four
times as many farmers in the neiyhourhood as there
are to-day. The township itself boasted three
pubs, a flourmill, a bank and sundry thriving shops. To-
day only two pubs and half the shops remain ; the
owners of the others have all gone to where they could
make a living—to some place where the farmer is and
the land-grabber is not. Population has vanished to
such an extent that no less than four schools have been
closed because they had no scholars. One Cope Cope
area of 3500 acres, which formerly maintained 13 farmers
with their wives and some 50 children, is now wholly in
the hands of two brothers. They have implements and
machinery, but they don’t use them. They say : “ Sheep
pay us well, and labor is troublesome ; so we don’t culti-
vate any longer.” For relief from these woes Victoria
looks to the Fisher land-tax policy. As for effective
State action—well, here is a law that has been in force
for 14 years, specially devised to prevent the accumula-
tion of large holdings ; yet not one of the many Lands
Ministers has enforced it, and there is little likelihood of
the one now in office doing any better than the rest.

Enter the Second Ballot.
These are days of political storm and change in
N.S.W. when the baffling spectacle is offered of
an allegedly anti-Socialistic Government, basing
all its claims to public support on the Socialistic
measures it has passed or means to pass, while
self-styled anti-Socialist newspapers are obliged
to barrack for rank Socialism or drop out of the
political game altogether. And so it caused no
general surprise when the S. M. Herald and
Sydney Telegraph, which erstwhile were able to
see nothing wrong with the good old voting
methods, somersaulted neatly and started
urging Wade to legislate so as to ensure


“ a proper expression of the people’s will
at the polls.” And, of course, Wade, after a
decent period of hesitancy, has said he will.
The reason for this abrupt conversion is plain
enough. The “Liberal” army has become
afflicted with panic, and, like all armies in that
plight, it has grown mutinous. “ The Machine,”
the contraption which lives in a cellar somewhere
underneath Pitt-street, has burst, and the wreck-
age is lying about in full view of the public. The
broken instrument has ceased to inspire “Liberal-
ism ” with awe. Parliamentary candidates pursue
their way regardless of it. And so it has come
about that in many constituencies there are two
or three “Liberal” candidates doggedly resolved
to go the poll, while in some there are as many
as half a dozen more or less certain starters. Under
the grand old electoral methods of our forebears
this sort of thing is no earthly good to “Liberal-
ism.” Wherefore the Second Ballot is to be tried.
No doubt, at the present juncture, the change
will somewhat benefit the Wade party. The
Labor organisation has never been so strong as it
is now, while anti-Labor has never been so di-
vided and discredited. There are fervid anti-
Labor constituencies in which, at the time of
writing, nothing but an alteration in the voting
system is going to preserve the “ Liberal ” fort.
For example, in Waverley, R. G. Watkins, a
popular resident, was chosen overwhelmingly
by the local Deform League. But Onslow, the
sitting member, reckoned that the League should
have chosen him, or, anyhow, that it shouldn’t
have chosen Watkins, and he refused to abide by
its decision; and in that attitude he has
been upheld by the Central “Liberal”
League. And Tomato Jessep, who was
beaten for the seat by Onslow, looms darkly in
the background with a block wowser voteconcealed
about him, and nearby lurks Hukley with some
more wowser vote. If these four run, Waverley,
under the existing system, must obviously be a gift
for thesolitary Laborite, Duncan. Assuming that
Duncan got 2000 votes out of 7000 polled, and the
four “ Liberals” split the remaining 5000 among
them, they would have a majority, but it would do
them little good. But under the method
which is foreshadowed, the “ Liberal ” who scores
the majority of anti-Labor votes will fight it out
again and alone with Duncan, a later.
There is no doubt about the reasonableness of the
arrangement. Certainly it would have been more
edifying had “Liberalism” felt the crying
need of something of the sort before its
own crowd got hopelessly demoralised and
out of control. As things are, a cynical
world is bound to say that “ Liberalism ” is rushing
this reform through, not somuchtosave the country
as in a desperate effort to save “Liberalism.”
And the cynics will be right. Labor may take
heart of grace in the matter by reflecting that
what looks like “ Liberalism’s ” picnic to-day may
be Labor’s to-morrow. It is unlikely that Labor’s
present excellent organisation and discipline are
going to last for all time. And the second ballot
has at least this merit —that it supplies a chance to
do away with the squalid and unseemly intrigues
which now so often attend the selection of candi-
dates, When it doesn’t matter to “ Liberalism ”
even if Onslow, Watkins, Jessep and Hukley
all insist on carrying its banner at Waverley, in-
asmuch as, provided there is a Liberal majority,
the party will win the seat in any case, there
should be a chance that “Liberalism” will cease
to clamor like a fish-fag on the highways and that
peace will supervene.
A Scandal that Doesn’t Bear Discussion.
N.S.'yV.’s “Liberal” press is kept so busy, these
explaining away the reproaches that are
hurled at the Wade Government from all quar-
ters that: it has hardly any time to drive home the
various sensational charges which Wade, Fitz-
patrick, Henley and the rest heave ceaselessly
at Labor. If there is anything whatever to be
urged in extenuation of any of these anti-WADK
accusations the Liberal press may be relied on to
urge it, hard and often. But sometimes—as in
the McKye case—the indictment is unanswerable-
and then the faithful daily paper student quests
in vain for written justification of his party
bosses. A topic which is as tabu just now, i n
“Liberal” circles, as the McKye case, is’the
Bowling jury-panel scandal, which R. D
Meagher ventilated in the Legislative Assembly
recently. Meagher put it to Wade : (1) that the
names of the jurymen who were to try Peter
Bowling were forwarded by the Government to
the Inspector-General of Police ; (2) that the list
was then passed on to the Metropolitan Superin-
tendent of Police, who (3) caused the Divisional
Inspectors to “ make inquiries ”; (4) that the list
was returned to the Justice Department, before
HI j Y to <* e ther with the information
g* rnered by the police regarding the jury-
men concerned, and (5) that it was on that infor-
mation the Crown stood aside certain jurors.
wade made the following remarkably evasive
and unsatisfactory answer:—
summons jurors for the trial of criminal
,X s ,? nt'rely on his own responsibility and without con-
siUtation with, or the knowledge of, the Crown Law
omcials. After jurors have been summoned, the Crown
f' a 7 e th , e . ri S:ht in all cases to obtain from the police
information with regard to any juror or jurors as to their
impartiality, or as to their character, and it is the duty
or the police to furnish any such information. Such a
procedure is manifestly in the interests of the adminis-
tration of justice, but inquiries are not authorised as to
individual juror’s political beliefs. In the trial the King
against Bowling, the Crown stood aside eight jurors and
the defendants challenged 39.
.There is a certain amount of truth in Wade’s
remark that the Crown has the right to obtain
information from the police with regard to jurors.
That is to say, a Crown Prosecutor in N.S.W. is
allowed to take the advice of a local policeman
when challenging jurymen. And once in a blue
moon, when it is suspected that criminals, or
associates of criminals, have inadvertently got on
. ® j ur y panel, a Crown Prosecutor exercises that
right. But between that and the extraordinary
procedure which the Wade Government tacitlv
admits to in the Bowling case there is a sizable
difference. The Sheriff is by Act of Parliament a
Ministerial officer, whose duty is simply to
prepare the jury panel. He may not show
it to anyone—policeman or otherwise—from
the time it is drawn up till the assize
begins. The idea is that, in the matter of the
jury, the Crown and the accused shall occupy
an equal footing. On the assumption that the
Crown has no more opportunity of gauging the
attitude of the jury than the accused has, many
Judges refuse even to allow a prisoner’s solicitor
to stand by and advise as to who he shall chal-
lenge. During the trial of the strikers at Dubbo,
in 1892, Chief Justice Darlky, on a famous occa-
sion, ordered out of court a man who, having
knowledge of the district, was signalling to one of
the accused as the jury came up to be sworn. To
put it briefly. Australian justice discourages
most vehemently any suspicion of traffic be-
tween jurymen and the accused, on the
one hand, and jurymen and the Crown on
the other. Consider the bowling injustice
of the performance which the Wade Government
has inferentially owned up to. Actually while
the luckless Bowling remained in blank ignor-
ance of the personnel of the jury panel, the
police, on behalf of the Crown, were scouring the
city inquiring in the delightfully naive phrase of
Premier Wade as to the prospective jurors’
“impartiality.” When one considers that the
normal policeman’s highest word of praise is
that “So and So has nothing against him”;
that a conviction is the end of every aspiring
J. Hop’s desire, and other things of the
sort, the Dunn’s eminent suitability as a
noser-out of “impartiality” in man or beast
becomes . apparent. There aren’t adjectives
enough in the language to do justice to the
wild inequity of this strange business. Regarded
as a manoeuvre in the direction of conviction-
securing, it is quite new. It is in palpable conflict
with every tradition of British or other jus-
tice. No leader-writer in all Toryism is capable
of whitewashing it—a fact with which Toryism
(in N.S.W.) is well acquainted. And so it has
joined the McKye case as one of the WADE-ite
blunders that are too tragic to be mentioned,
and that must be trusted by the grace of Provi-
dence to die a natural death.
A New Ear Wanted for an Old Tale.
“Pressman ” speaks about bobby methods :
Another unfortunate prisoner has been fatally injured
while in the custody of police officers, this time ar,
Napier (Maoriland). He was a ship’s carpenter, and had
been arrested for drunkenness, but when being removed
to the cells from the police-station he resisted, and, as
was stated at the inquest, “there was no room in the
narrow passage for the two constables to handle him."
About the next thing the prisoner knew was being in hos-
pital, where he told an inspector of police that he remem-
bered a constable “ pressing his head forward and pressing
on it.” His spine was injured, his hands paralysed, and
he died. The John Hop who had charge of the drunk in
the station passage stated that he (the drunk) raised his
arms, apparently to catch the top of the door, and then
slipped from the top step. The jury returned a verdict
of accidental death, and held J. Hop blameless.
Accepting that as being correct, although in addition
to being drunk at the time, the ship’s carpenter is now
entirely dead, and cannot give his version of what
actually took place, the time seems opportune to point
out that too many people are being injured more or less
severely while under arrest in Australia and M L
One of the reasons for this is the comparatively recent
outbreak of ju-jitsu amongst the rank and file of the
Hops. It is humanly impossible to expect all the men
who learn the brutal Japanese falls and breaks and holds
to be particularly unwilling to practise them on an unfor-
tunate who gives, it may be, some provocation in his
drunkenness or anger. In the larger cities especially
there is an increasing amount of slam-walloping by the
police. Probably the main menace of this lies in the fact
that the majority of police magistrates utterly refuse to
investigate complaints bv arrested persons, even when
the arrested persons are injured in such a wav as to give
absolute proof of personal assault. Many.of'the magis-
trates even make the legal, and often unjust, punish-
ment more severewhen complaint is made against the
arresting constable. It is true that one magistrate in
Sydney fined a constable a few pounds the other dav on
a charge of assaulting a citizen and breaking his jaw' but
such an instance of a citizen’s word being believed against
the word of a policeman is as rare as the sentence was
ridiculous. If the John Dunn was guilty, as the magis-
trate held he was, of assaulting, while in uniform a per
son on the sidewalk, there should be only one result-
gaol. If a citizen had rushed up and broken the police
officer s jaw, the writer of these remarks is willing to
wager drinks all round that he would have been shot ud
to Darhnghurst for three months before he had time to
get a grip on the dock railings.
xr o f w ra ® ons j deraWe experience of police methods in
N.S.W. and other parts of Australia, as well as in Maori-
land, my opinion is that all charges of serious assault
made against policemen should be investigated' hv a
District Court Judge. The public stands to be bat
tered. crippled and. perhaps, killed and unavenged
as long as the police magistrates are the persons
who hear the complaints. Some magistrates hold it to
be bad policy to show the public that the word and oath
of a policeman can’t be implicitly relied upon. Others
cannot overcome the suspicion that a prisoner, in making
complaints of man-handling against an officer, is endea
voring to mitigate his original offence, or has a personal
grudge against the policeman, or assaulted the police-
man first and deserved what he subsequentlv <rot
Others, again, and they are the most to be dreaded anti
cursed, are afraid of offending the police, for various
reasons Anybody who is familiar with the minor
tribunals of the States knows how free affable
and even contemptuous the average constable’ is when
he stands giving evidence before a police magistrate It
is not an uncommon thing for a damaged man when he
quavers or blurts out a charge of cruelty against the con
stable, to hear it brushed aside bv the bobby who
leans from the witness box to smilingly say to the in avis
trate : “It’s the old tale, y’ Worship:” g S '
It is an old tale ; but age doesn’t seem to give it anv
better chance of being investigated. And that is whv I
advocate that' District Court Judges should deal with
charges of brutality laid against officers of police It
would be a cold day for a peeler who leaned over to some
of the District Court horsewigs, and breathed heavilv
upon them, and remarked that it was the old tale *
The Political Parson.
The parson has the same right to take a hand in
politics as any other citizen, but a feeling begins
to arise that, when he takes to politics, he ought
to play the game at least as decently as an
ordinary Pagan would do. And the militant
parson in politics seldom does play the game. He
has a reputation for wild inaccuracy that stink 3
in the halls of Heaven. He has a name for un-
scrupulousness that is over the odds. Anyone
who reads the papers regularly can make out
a list of reverend gentlemen who have be-
come conspicuous throughout Australia. They
preach political sermons, deliver political
lectures and addresses, and shine with a
great radiance at political deputations. They
tackle all manner of subjects, including
football and social purity; and they bristle
with statements which can’t bear inspection, and
with statistics which they have apparently manu-
factured themselves. They are great at hints and
innuendoes and veiled slanders, and none save
the most persistent opponent can pin them down
to a definite statement, if the definite statement
begins to look dangerous. When they are bowled
out in a glaring untruth, or a dozen glaring un-
truths, they show no such signs of shame as a
commercial traveller or sharebroker might do,
nor do they usually apologise, though that is ai’i
act which the deck-band of a ferry steamer is
capable of should he discover that he has done
someone an injury. The bowled-out political
preacher, as a rule, just retires with dignity
in a cloud of indefinite sanctity, and turns
up at the next opportunity with a new set of
allegations as reckless as the previous lot. His
unreliabilty is amazing, and his disregard for all
ideas of fair play is the limit. On these matters
it seems to be no use appealing to his better self,
for apparently he has none. So the idea gains
ground among lawyers and other cynics that there
are two persons who are not to be taken seriously
—a hysterical woman and a sensational reverend.
In this matter the R.C. Church has an advant-
age ; its discipline is good, and while the man at
the top may make a wild exhibition or ass of him-
self if he feels so inclined, the rest of the clergy
are required, as a rule, to stick to plain business.
But in the multitude of Protestant Churches
almost any man may be a public show or Chamber
of Horrors, if he feels so disposed. Thus the poli-
tical parson has become an institution, and a very
bad one at that. No person who studies public
matters believes his assertions, or his statistics,
or his inferences; for it is only necessary to
look up a few books of reference to find how
shamefully, in most cases, the facts have been
manipulated. A lingering respect for his “ cloth ”
prevents peoplefrom very openly callinghim aliar,
a coward and a slanderer ; but he does unutterable
damage to the Church all the same. If, when this
sort of holy character was proved to have backed
up his cause with gross misstatements, and
propped it with false evidence or bogus statistics,
his Church cast him out, then the Church would
retain public respect. As it never does so, a great
part of the community reckons that the Church is
all alike, and keeps away from the place of wor-
ship. It wants to be fairly clean, and it reckons
that the place of worship is not nearly so clean as
it might be.
A Painful Set of Circumstances.
Sydney Daily Telegraph printed this last
week :
The disgraceful attacks on the Premier over the coal
strike and the subsequent “ Coercion Act,” have abated
somewhat, although there are still .some members of the
Labor party who are content to play the contemptible
part. The case against the “ Coercion Act,” however, is
becoming increasingly hard to sustain. The simple facts
that Bowling and his associates are not serving sentences
Under the “ Coercion Act ” at all, and that their guilt
was established not by an untrammelled Judge, but by
an ordinary jury, are rather unfortunate for those who
would purchase a political advantage at any cost of truth.
It is an unusually audacious bit of quibbling.
The Telegraph takes the point that there is no
case against the Coercion Act because no one
happens at the present moment to be serving a
sentence under it. As well Say there is no case
against N.S.W.’s infamous Capital punishment
enactments because no one chances to be actually
suspended by the neck at this exact moment. It
is true no one is at present doing time as a result
of the passage of the N.S.W. Coercion Act. It
is also and equally true, though the Telegraph
omits to mention it, that Bowling and his
associates have already done time under the
Coercion Act. And some of them have done
time under that Act and no other. N.S.W is
sorry for Bowling and his friends, but it would
be crediting the people with an unnatural amount
of altruism if one were to suggest that the troubles
of these unfortunates account for anything like all
the feeling against Wade’s extraordinary legisla-
tion. London Times, which has, probably, never
heard of Bowling, was as much shocked at the
brutal injusticC'of the Act, which “Liberalism”
in N.S.W. is now attempting to justify, as any
local Laborite. The reflection which agitates the
normal unregenerate citizen in this connection is
not so much that some total strangers have been
publicly leg-ironed and gaoled, owing to WaDe’s
panic measure, as that he (the citizen) is liable
to suffer the same fate as long as the Coercion
Act stays in the btatute Book. Lovers of
justice and freedom in N.S.W. have two
cardinal grievances against the Coercion Act: (1)
That it abrogates the right of every citizen to be
tried by a jury of his peers ; (2) that it creates a
brand new crime and prescribes gaol for a deed
which no civilised country has hitherto regarded
as wrongful, and which, in England, has been
expressly legalised by Act of Parliament. These
two objections alone account for what the Tele-
graph calls “the disgraceful attacks on the
Premier over the coal strike and the subsequent
Coercion Act.” Nor ha ve they abated, as alleged.
It is hard to conceive that in a civilised, enlight-
ened country they could abate till the Act was
repealed and the author of it put where he would
be unable to achieve any more outrages of the
sort.
Dodging the Issue.
AsTRANGELYdodgy, shifty, side-stepping, evasive,
indefinable, shadowy individual is the preacher!
This, for instance, was Parson Worrall, as re-
cently reported in the daily press
The Rev. Henry Worrall said that they desired to pro-
test against the brutality that was manifesting itself in
our civilisation. Two years ago there was one of the
most alarming exhibitions of savagery that had ever been
seen in Australia. That was the contest at Rushoutter’s
Ba y, Sydney. Some time ago the Church introduced
some black missionaries from Fiji; but, before thev were
allowed to stand in a Christian pulpit to advocate the
policy of foreign a Sum of £2OO had to be found
and lodged with the Federal authorities in respect to
each, so that they would be deported from the Common-
wealth again. Jack Johnson, however, was received
with open arms.
Mr. Fisher: Do you allege that he was treated
differently?
The Rev. Mr. Worrall: I am only putting the two
cases.
Mr. Fisher : What has that to do with the question ?
The Rev. Mr. Worrall: 1 was going to say—
Mr. Fishkr (angrily): Do you allege that Johnson was
treated differently from the Fijians?
The Rev. Mr. Worrall : I am simply giving the in-
stance now, as i t touches the matter generally.
Mr. Fishkr : Is there any allegation that your mission-
aries were treated differently from Jack Johnson?
The Rev. Mr. Worrall : I am not in a position to say
what was done by the Federal Government.
Mr. Fisiikr (sharply) : Do you allege that there was a
distinction made?
The Rev. Mr. Worrall : No.
That was all that happened at the time, but there
were alarms and excursions later on. It was proved
that the statement about the Fijian missioners
having to put up £2OO was absolutely baseless,
and Parson Worrall was communicated with.
The reverend gentleman didn’t apologise. Then
there were further requests for information, and
the end of it all was this newspaper paragraph :
Further correspondence has taken place between Rev.
H. Worrall and the Department of External Affairs
relative to the former’s statement regarding the admission
of Jack Johnson, the colored pugilist. In his most recent
letter Mr. Worrall DENIES THAT IN HIS REMARKS
HE OAST ANY IMPUTATION AGAINST THE DEPART-
MENT IN THE WAY OF DISCRIMINATION IN FAVOR
OF THE PUGILIST IN COMPARISON WITH FIJI
NATIVE MISSIONARIES.
Now the question remains: If Parson Worrall
didn’t cast an imputation, then what on earth did
Parson Worrall cast ’
« —
Has Anyone Lost Any Small Boys?
“F.C.” writes :
Somebody seems very prolific in new schemes for
obtaining cheap labor. The cry for the “reliable farm
laborer ” is always with us, and only the other day sundry
retiring persons eagerly spread a demand for 1000 girls,
there being allegedly a scarcity of young citizenesses.
Now the cry is for boys. “ VVe have advertised,” the
employers say, “time after time, and we cannot get
boys.” Yet the small boy, poking his inquisitive nose
into everything, seems as frequent as ever. He pervades
football matches as numerously and noisily as of old,
while others of him fill every vacant space on Saturday
afternoons playing the game themselves. Also the
Statistician’s returns mention his continued arrival,
while his rate of departure keeps about normal. The
fact is, the small boy is as numerous as ever ;
but he, per his parents, isn’t rushing the first
billet that comes along as he used to do. Partly
through increased prosperity and partly through wiser
legislation he isn’t forced to hunt for a job at quite so
early an age as formerly. In some of the States, and, ton
considerable extent, he is taking more to the land than of
old ; but, above all, he, or rather his parent, decides
that, if he objects to “the land ” and prefers afactory, he
shall learn a trade properly, so that he shall have a decent
means of livelihood by-and-bye. There has been no moan
re scarcity of boys from those employers who apprentice
them and teach them a trade thoroughly—the trouble is
the other way about. But for the employer who wants a
youth for a few years only—to be then replaced by
another, and turned out useless—there is a scarcity. And
it is well that it should be so. From the “ blind aileys of
employment”—lift boys, message boys, odd-job boys,
pasters in jam factories, tackers in tanneries, generally
usefuls in softgoods emporiums, junior clerks and so forth
—there is a loud demand but little supply ; for which the
Lord be praised. In some of these — er—professions
a lad of 16 or 17 may earn ss. a week, in others he may
make up to 25s.—writer knows some now making the
latter sum—but whether the wages be small or large, the
workers will inevitably be passed out in a year or two, tb
become—nothing. \Vhen the exploiting employer—the
one who regards his employees just as he does his stock,
solely from the point of profit-earning capacity—takes
steps to see that his apprentices (not mere casual lads
taken on and put off at will) shall be paid fair, regular
wages, and shall be thoroughly instructed in some busi-
ness that will yield them a living, he will find the tem-
porarily vanished boy become numerous again. He will
emerge from his concealment like the sun from behind a
cloud, and harmonious relations will resume at the old
address.

“Itan”: Port Stephens is about 'the only pro-
position between Newcastle and the Queensland
border worth the serious attention of Wade's
Royal Commission on trade outlets. The bar
harbors are pretty hopeless. Byron Bay might
be made reasonably accessible, and so might
Coff’s Harbor ; but it would mean paying much
money for small results. The only thing that
could be done with the Tweed is to block up the
bar and cut a new channel through the neck of
sand which joins Point Danger to the mainland.
Then the new entrance would be in Queensland
territory. The Clarence River may be made
pretty safe by doing something of the same
kind on the south side, only that the cutting
would have to be made through rock instead of
sand. Port Stephens is a splendid sheet of water,
always safe for shipping. Why it has been passed
by all these years is past all understanding, unless
the centralisation policy of the Government is the
explanation. With cross-country lines, and the
completion of the North Coast railway, a short
link to Port Stephens would start a new centre
second only to Sydney in shipping trade.
Almost anything that can be raised in sub-
tropical Australia can be abundantly produced
within 100 miles to the west and north of this
neglected waterway and gateway. Incidentally,
the Royal Commission might ascertain how far
the schemes devised by the imported John Coodk
—he of the awful Coode Canal in Melbourne
for the improvement of bar harbors have failed,
and the amount of money which has been squan-
dered in following out the imported person’s
advice.
In 1897 a conference of Australian Chambers of
Commerce was held in Sydney to consider what
view the corner grocery ought to take of the
Federation that was hanging in the’balance ; and
Russell French, then and now general manager
of the biggest Australian bank, was asked to come
along and be the conference’s guide on banking
matters. He had some doubts whether it was
wise for him to do it; but he went and lectured
the conference, and most of the lecture was about
notes. The smashes of ’92-3 weren’t so long past
then as to have been forgotten ; and the confer-
ence’s banking authority was dead against the
existing system under which any tinpot concern
can put out as much paper as it can
wheedle the public into accepting. Even
the English system of issuing notes al-
most, entirely through the Bank of England
wasn t quite satisfactory, he advised, because
“when abnormal conditions, such as periods of
crisis, supervene, the Act of Parliament by which
the issue is authorised has to be suspended in
order to do away for'the time being with the’rigid
regulations which prevent expansion.” So the
Australian banking spokesman, speaking with
the ghost of '93 still roosting on the water-bottle,
wanted a note issue “ based on due proportions of
coin and Federal Government securities”:—
Such a note, having Federal sanction, and resting
apart from the coin basis, on the credit of the whole
Federation, would be a wholly satisfactory circulatory
medium in ordinary times and for ordinary purposes of
business, and would serve as a bulwark of no insignificant
strength to resist and overcome the results of panic....
And as a practical consideration, it can scarcely be denied
that a uniform note system common to the" federated
colonies, would conduce in some degree to the con-
venience of the public, and would be much more cheaply
administered in the matter of working expenses.
That certainly didn’t express or imply approval
of such a half-hearted scheme as Fisher has put

The Jam.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jammed in the narrow way,
Jammed where the streets are gray,
Crushed in the going,
More wheels, and more, and more,
Increasing railways pour
A continent’s rich store,
For ever growing.
Always to Sydney town
The costly bales come down,
The ways to throttle—
To push, and squeeze, and crush,
Amid the close-pent rush
In the neck none can flush
Of Redfern’s bottle.
A score of ports abused,
Free gateways long unused
Along the seaboard ;
With all the notes of trade
For ever wrought and played—
Discordant music made—
On one cracked keyboard.
Quick ! Duplicate the steel!
Let staggering waggons reel
Through Redfern tunnel;
More wheels, and more, and more,
A continent’s rich store
Increasing highways pour
Into the funnel!
Fools, end the sorry play !
Your ports stand wide to-day,
Free for the taking ;
Dare you still hesitate
To free your throttled State,
While idle waters wait
Your saner waking.

An Apology.
It is with deep regret that The Bulletin finds
that in a paragraph contributed by “ Pitman ” to
its issue of 14th nit., reflecting upon the conduct
of the proprietors of the Sydney Morning
Herald to their late manager, Mr- Samuel Cook,
it has been used by a hitherto exceptionally
trusted contributor for the purpose of unfairly,
and without the slightest shadow of foundation,
disparaging the proprietors of the Sydney
Morning Herald. The worst thing that can
happen to a newspaper is to be led into mis-
representing the actions and motives of others,
and The Bulletin is grieved to find that it has
been made to do this. The Bulletin desires it
to be fully known that it is satisfied that the
statements in the paragraph were incorrect—that
not only did the late Mr. Cook voluntarily retire
from his position on the S. M. Herald, but that
he did so under conditions highly creditable to
the Proprietary. The firm, which had treated
him with the greatest liberality during his official
life, continued to do so right up to the day of his
death.; their old manager and friend received the
full reward of good service and unswerving
loyalty.
The Bulletin now publicly tenders its sincere
and unreserved apology to Messrs. John Fairfax
and Sons, and expresses its regret for the publi-
cation of the paragraph in question, and for the
pain and annoyance it must have caused to a firm
whose reputation for rectitude stands so high
amongst journalists and in the community gener-
ally as to be beyond injury by the attack for
which The Bulletin was made the vehicle.
As the Messrs. Fairfax are aware, the delay in
making public this statement of regret has been
in no wise due to unwillingness on the part of
The Bulletin proprietary to admit the wrong
and to offer its apologies.
•Helping the Publican—with an Axe.
Finding nothing but a frozen silence greet the
old, worn-out wheeze that the Labor party is
hitched to all the worst liquor interests in a con-
spiracy to induce or drive the general public to a
drunkards’ cemetery or an inebriates’ home,
Premier Wade has recently left it hanging on the
rack with last year’s hat. Meanwhile, he has
thought out something even more remarkable. At
Gordon (Sydney), on August 8. he warned his
hearers to “ beware of an insidious move on the
pairt of the Labor party, the effect of which might
be to kill the efforts at reform on the liquor ques-
tion of the past and in the future.” Said
Gregory I.
The proposal was to wipe out local option and substi-
tute State option—to induce the people to place, as it
were, the whole of their eggs in the one basket. The
belief was that if this question were put to New South
Wales as a whole there would be a majority in favor of
continuance, and so cause the failure of temperance legis-
lation, and stay its advance for an indefinite period. He
urged them to beware of such a move, and of the party
behind it.
The infliction under which Wade suffers—the
horror of amalgamating a number of political
backyards into a national park—has got him down
again. He cannot see that the Labor party’s pro-
posal to . give the public one State option,
on a bare majority, is far more democratic
and ten times more threatening to the liquor
trade than 90 pint-pot options, at which
the Teapot party is not allowed to win
unless it can raise a three-fifths majority. The
Wade crowd’s theory is that, if the anti-Drink
gang can get at least 60 per cent, of the local
votes, it is entitled to shut the bars in the town
of Smallbeerville. The Labor idea is that, if
the anti-Drink gang can get per cent, of the
votes all round, it should be able to shut every
bar in N.S.W. That may be an attempt to favor
the publicans, but it doesn’t look it. In M.L.,
where they know all about local option, the
leaders of the teetotal movement are clamor-
ing for State option on the lines proposed by
the N. S. Wales Laborites as the true method
of reform; and if Wade was the obstacle in the
way of getting it in M.L., as he apparently pro-
poses to be in the Ma State, he would stand an
even money chance of being pushed out of businai*
suddenly.
+
“ Hurry Off,” from a shindy ”: —
It was the gyrations of the “Liberal” lights in the
Sydney North Shore seat (St. Leonards) that really gave
birth to Wade’s second-ballot scheme. The gyrations in
other electorates helped, of course ; but the row and biff
round Teddy Clark, M.L.A., put the matter beyond
doubt. There is quite'a mob of nice people in St.
Leonards who would just as soon be represented by the
Dago driver of a hurdy-gurdy as by E. M. Clark ; so the
boss Liberals decided to call for nominations for the seat.
A gushing “ invite ” was sent to Teddy also ; but
Teddy merely sniffed at the hook, and informed
the committee that, having selected himself as the
Liberal candidate, he intended to go right ahead
without assistance. The Nice Liberals then de-
cided to select a candidate from those who had been
formally nominated. These were Cocks (a wholesale
alarm clock importer and a city alderman), Bignold (a
budding, tame barrister), Carroll (a political once-upon-
a-time), Clive Teece (son of the A.M.P.), and other costly
articles too numerous to mention. And all was going
merry as a marriage bottle till Littlejohn arose. Now,
this Littlejohn is Somebody, although just what I’ve
forgotten'. Anyhow, what he says usually goes; and
what he said on this occasion was : “Don’t select any-
body I’’ Littlejack, it appeared, had discovered that
Alarm Clocks had too many wheels at work
for young Teece, and so Big.toiin side-tracked
things until an appeal was made to Wade. Which pushed
that harassed leader further into the soup tureen than
ever. He wanted Clark’s vote, and he didn’t want to
offend the local league by upholding Teddy, who had
been the cause of all the disturbance and language.
While Wade was hanging off in the hope that several
persons would suddenly die, the local “ Liberal” women
held a meeting, threw their collective gamp on the table
as a gage of battle and selected Alderman Clocks. Pre-
sently the men held a meeting, and Clocks, who had
been" raising as much noise as if his ware-
house had been wound up to strike every 20
minutes, appeared to be the only original nominee
left. All the others had been drowned, or had married,
or joined in the chase for Crippen. But just when quiet-
ness and peace seemed about to settle,- some more
Liberals — whom I don’t know from Adam— hastily nomi-
nated themselves, and the hubbub and bulloeky remarks
started all over again. Clocks whirled his hands around
about 10,005 times to the hour, and Wade kept his legis-
carpenters working back at night to fix a Second
Ballot Bill, so that Clark and Clocks and Bignold and
Teece and Carroll and the Ilth hour push would all
be able to tear into the scrum. Meanwhile the electors
have grown sick of the shindv, and have started reading
Down’s proposals. Down is the Labor candidate.

“Shellback ’ on some proposed improvements
to Sydney Harbor :
People who hadn’t dreamt that there could possibly be
anything wrong-with “our harbor,” got the jumps the
other day on being assured that the system of lighting
was no system at all, but only a jumble. In the whirl of
the discussion one fact was clear—the lack of agreement
between the Harbor Trust and the Navigation Depart-
ment. In conjunction, these two exercise authority
over the navigator once he makes his appearance
inside the Heads. But while the first authority
admits that improvements are required, the Navi-
gation Department maintains an attitude of mulish
opposition. And that forces one to say that the
Board’s officials, outside the sea-going pilots, can
scarcely be classed as up-to-date, alive, navigating ex-
perts. The majority are ex-sailing shipmasters, accus-
tomed in their day to be brought up the harbor by pilots,
and carefully berthed with the aid of one or more tugs.
From the pilots an official expression can hardly be
expected, seeing that it is their own Department that is
on trial. So we are forced back on to those most com-
petent to express an opinion—the exempt masters who
have to work the harbor at all hours and in all weathers.
And they, almost to a man, say that present conditions are
shockingly bad, and ought to be abolished in favor of a
system of leading lights and beacons such as is elsewhere
almost invariably used.
The “ sailing directions ” for Sydney Harbor also belong
to the Stone Age. The depth of water in the west chan-
nel, for example, is given as 20-24 ft. Now, a doubtful
margin of 4ft. in a narrow channel has no right to exist
in any official nautical directory. An absolute minimum
depth ought to be stated. Further, too great a use is
made of church spires as leading marks.
But, if the Board is decrepit! the Trust is negligent.
After the Wyreema-Currajong collision, off Bradley’s
Head, a vessel was placed to mark the position of the
wreck ; but, contrary to all accepted rules, it displayed
a single white light. The orthodox lighting consists of
two vertical green lights on the navigable side. Again,
the buoy off Dobroyde Point was recently removed, and
Up to date has hpt been replaced ; but no official notifica-
tion of its removal has been issued to mariners, and the
chart of Sydney Harbor still contains the information
that the buoy is in position.
Of systems of harbor lighting most calculated to worry
those in charge, commend me to the locally-favored gas
buoy. It breaks adrift at the most inconvenient seasons,
and the light, being mostly in exposed positions, re-
quires constant watching—which means expense. All
things considered, absolutely the best system of lighting,
where shore positions are easily available, as is the case
in Sydney, is one of leading lights and beacons, clearly
defining the exact position of mid-channel, and in most
eases the greatest depth of water. The adoption of this
system would, to a large extent, do away with the hard
swearing now heard at courts of marine inquiry, especi-
ally after harbor collisions.

“F.T.P.” : The new Commonwealth Arbitration
Bill has apparently driven the N.S.W. Premier
to a frenzy, from which I carve tbreepenn’orth,
thus
During the elections, the Labor party ridiculed the
warning we gave the public that one of their first steps
would be to undermine the State constitutions by endea-
voring to shear our Parliaments and tribunals of their
powers. The warning fell on deaf ears, and now we
seem destined to realise in the immediate future the un-
relenting hostility of the Commonwealth Government
towards State rights.
It is remarkable how an allegedly intelligent man
can be hobbled by a single idea. In Wade’s case
the One Idea is that the States are holy, and that
to even look sideways at their blessed privileges
is sacrilege. The mental obscuration caused by
that One Idea leads to some curious results. It
prevents Wade from seeing whence the States
acquired their Rights. Seemingly, he is convinced
that the Rights were bestowed upon the Chosen
States somewhat after the fashion in which the
Ten Commandments were bestowed upon the
Chosen People. Such a commonplace origin for
the Rights as the will of the federated people has
no chance of being discerned by the man with
the One Idea. Quite naturally, the proprietor of
the One Idea is unable to understand that
the people, in their Federal capacity, have any
right to change the incidence of, or in fact inter-
fere in any way with, the Rights they have given
themselves in their State capacity. Also, Wade
assumes—still as a result of the One Idea—that
everybody else (with the exception of the Labor
party) has the same Idea as he has. As a conse-
quence, he makes such remarks as “the warning
fell on deaf ears” ; that is to say, Wade is sure
that the people did not hear the warning, being
deaf or drunk or asleep or something. If the
people had heard the warning, Wade is sure they
would have been just as shocked as, he is.
But, as a matter of fact, the people did hear the
warning, and thought it a very foolish business.
What WaDe really told them was that they had
no right to decide how far they should govern
themselves through the Federal Parliament and
to what extent they should govern themselves
through the State Legislatures. In that matter
they were not to decide ; the dreadfully superior
autocrat Wade was to decide for them—the
dreadfully superior Wade who calls himself
“ the States.” And; to the great grief of the ,
dreadfully superior Wade, they took no notice of
Wade, but decided to govern themselves.
“ J. Caul” (from Masterton, M.L.): —
For the sake of a lot of people who appear to have a
good chance of going publess after the next elections in
N.S.W., let Bung be warned to adopt methods as unlike
as possible those of his M.L. brother prior to the last
local option poll. The pietists were not so much respon-
sible for six more electorates going “dry" as were the
meanness and ignorance of “the trade.” There were no
brains used, because, in the main, Bung has no brains
(excepting liquor-selling brains); and, incredible as it may
seem in view of the wealth of the trade and the enormous
loss it was faced with, practically none of any value were
hired. If the booze sellers had even put before the
public in a readable form that such races as the Turks
and Arabs, who are supposed to abhor Bacchus, are
amongst the lowest, meanest, dirtiest and most blood-
thirsty peoples on the planet, and a lot of simple facts of
the sort, they would have helped their cause ; but it
would have cost them a few pounds, and when you talk
in pounds to Bung (in M.L. anyhow) you need to break it
to him gently, in ease he drops dead. A free beer is
about his limit in payment, and naturally he got the free
beer kind of service.
Then, again, the owners or agents (who usually live in a
city away from the threatened No-License) have par-
ticular fool-ideas of their own. One firm of brokers
leases its up-country pubs with this clause : “ All renova-
tion and repairs shall be done by the lessee, materials to
be provided by the iessor,” and in many cases even a pane
of glass or a lock will be sent 80 or 90 miles, while the local
storekeeper is ignored. This gets more ill-will heated up.
I notice by the cables that the N.S.W. No-License
party is engaging 30 lecturers. Let the Australian Bung
watch out for them ; some of them are no slouches. I’m
not uttering this warning for Bung’s sake—he deserves
all he gets—but I’m living in a No-License town, and I’d
like to save other folk from the folly of the system.
Government pontrol of the liquor traffic is better than
No-License ; and my grievance is that we haven’t got
State control, lock, stock, barrel and brewery.

Sydney shows no tendency to weary of
the great jest of “The Brass Bottle,” and Her
Majesty’s tills nightly. There are many lessons
to be dug out of this quaint play, though there is
little coherence or sequence about them. The
high-class workmanship of the bottle suggests
that whatever is worth doing is worth doing well,
and the firm manner in which the cork was driven
in emphasises the lesson. Evidently Solomon
did things thoroughly in his occasional active
moments. The compression of so much Jinn into
so very little bottle is evidently meant to teach
abhorrence of the overcrowding habits of the
Old World. At the same time, the survival
of the Jinn for 2000 years at the bottom
of the sea shows how a careful avoidance of
alcohol tends to prolong life. There was no
public house in the bottle, and the result
is obvious. The fact that Solomon was able to
throw the Jinn overboard into deep water demon-
strates the advantages possessed by a maritime
people and the necessity of possessing a fleet of
our own. A country which depends on a hired
foreign squadron- has no reliable means of getting
rid of Jinns, and can’t guarantee that they will be
thrown overboard at the right place. Prolonged
consideration of the Jinn’s whiskers and head-
furniture inculcates a great lesson as to the ad-
visability of every citizen having his hair cut
regularly, and the complete absence of drains in
the Arabian palace which he built in a night was
evidently meant as an essay on sanitation and a
warning to clean up the slums of Chippendale
(Sydney). The case of the professor who was
turned into a mule inspires a few hurried remarks
about kindness to animals. And the stupendous
wealth which the Jinn brought to Horace Yenti-
more is, in a remote sort of way, indicative of the
collection which would be taken up at the end of
this discourse if circumstances were more favor-
able. ’

The Stage Society, Sydney, has a varied
bill of fare for its next performance on August 19
at the Standard Theatre. Three one-act plays
are to be produced. “Fritzchen,” a tragedy by
Hermann Sudermann, the most famous of modern
German - playwrights, will be in sharp Contrast
with the comedy, “In a Workhouse Ward,” a
quaint example of Irish humor. This little
comedy has been produced by the Abbey Theatre,
Dublin ; and it is regarded as one of the best ex-
amples of Lady Gregory’s work. The third play
is a fantasy by Arthur H. Adams, entitled
“Pierrot in Australia.” W. B. Beattie, who will
produce all three plays, takes the part of Pierrot
—a Pierrot with a swag. The society has done
good work in the past in presenting such dramas
as “ The Fantastic*,” “ The Doll’s House,” and
“ Hedda Gabler.”
An excellent little sundry show in Sydney
last week was Walter Bentley’s Shakspearian
recital at St. James’s Hall, on Thursday. The
affair was really a skilful mixture of lecture and
recital, with here and there a rivulet of Shak-
spearian melody to refresh the ear. The students
of the Bentley College assisted their experienced
head in several scenes, chiefest of which was the
meat item from “The Merchant of Venice” —
that wherein Shvlock bargains for the pound of
flesh. During the lecture part of the entertain-
ment, the actor-general spoke hopefully of the
establishment of State theatres, and took occa-
sion to patriotically defend the Stage against its
assailants, remarking that the fault was not of the
people who sold the goods, but of those who de-
manded them.

Leah Myers sang in Sydney last Tuesday
to a Y.M.C. A.-full of her friends; and the know-
ledge that they, had all paid must have exhilarated
the young mezzo-soprano. To receive gold for
ones notes shows great appreciation iu days when
the singer is large and numerous on the hill, and
the daily papers are speaking disrespectfully of
notes and hinting that they won’t be cashed. A
specially-acceptable item was the duet “ Maying”
with the amber-haired Maurice Chenowetb, a
tenor of increasing vogue.
* * Sir-
Smith is dipped nightly into the Arcadian
well of truth or tick-mixture at Sydney Cri.
Business is so vast that to all appearances Smith
may be worn out and the well may be worn out also
before the takings cease to make it worthwhile
to dip Smith any' longer. In fact, this writer
puts the telescope of faith to the eye of prophecy,
and, looking into the dim future, he sees the tenth
Smith being one evening dipped in the seventh
well or tank. He arrives at these figures on
a rough estimate that the average well lasts
50 per cent, longer than the average Smith.
The whereabouts of Arcadia is still un-
settled, but with the burnished optic of faith
the present scribe 1 sees it afar. It is the place
where there are no house-agents or sales of corner
allotments or land auctions, and it lies next to
Prester John’s country, and not far from El
Dorado. Its outskirts can be viewed in the
western sky when the sun is low, and the rest of
it lies at the back of the north wind, in the region
where the Devil went insolvent.

The Tivoli continues to shed its artists as
a tree casts off its foliage at the end of the warm
weather. Frank Travis is due to depart on
Tuesday, just after this Bulletin has fled to
press ; and the Charlenes follow him off the bill
on Wednesday, a few hours before it puts on its
pink cover and hurries out into the world. Olga
Grey, the smart Australian girl mimic, and Bert
Terrell, the beautiful person who yodels like a
happy Swiss milkman in the garments of Holland,
are the performers called on by the management
to fill the bill and assist Fred Keeton, De Lyle
and Brunin and Powell and Vesey—the five
remaining supporters of the second part.

Adelaide has had a week of unusually
varied shows. The most novel is that of Morris
Cronin and party, just arrived at the Tivoli from
the U.S.A. Cronin juggles brilliantly with any-
thing handy, while the “ party,” of various sizes,
strolls in and out, always arriving just in time to
gather in some flying object that seems to be going
to smash. One of it collects clubs that are thrown
his wav till he looks like a pincushion ; when he
has nothing else left to catch with he catches
with his legs. The turn is as funny as it is clever.
The Exhibition had one crowded night of
Pageant, in which 100 amateur ladies paraded in
the costumes of 1066 and onwards up to 1910, a
daughter of Governor Bosanquet being at each end
of the scale. Also, there were tableaux. There
was no marked unwillingness to appear as Joan of
Arc. or Helen of Troy, or a lady in Elizabethan
rig; but general sympathy was expressed for the
girl who had to represent the last-fashion-but-
one. At the Royal, ‘‘The Night of the Party”
has run a week. It has bright spots, as where
the masquerader protests that he has been “bluff-
ing and lying, on my honor as a gentleman,” but
generally the audience has to give its intellect a
rest, and laugh at the bustling situations. Hugh
Buckler and Willoughby divide the honors with
David James, whose quaint way of saying every-
thing as if he were gagging it made him a
favorite. The present piece is “Mr. Preedy,
etc.,” a variant of the familiar modern idea of
the big lady and the small man. This.is where
Miss Mab Paul, of the superb figure and the
Palotta-like voice, gets her chance.

At Her Majesty’s (Melb.) crowded
audiences since the first night of “ Madam
Butterfly” have consisted largely of folk who,
knowing what to expect, accepted Puccini’s music
with gratitude, and partly of the multitude that
came in ignorance and went away in doubt. As
an attraction the opera is popular ; as an enter-
tainment it commands much enthusiastic praise,
some of which runs to hysteria. Moreover, the
changes in the cast are an additional cause for
managerial content. The orchestration, of course,
is the main thing with the enlightened, and the
vocalism goes for a good deal; but the difference
between the personalities of one Cho Cho
San and Pinkerton and another pair of prin-
cipals is • also an interesting point in the
proceedings. Amy Castles, who is probably
a stronger “ draw ” than Bel Sorel, took the name
part three nights last week. When The Bulletin
heard her, she sang with rather less sweetness
and fluency—less glycerine in the voice-produc-
tion—than the French lady; nor did the rougher
warble of John Zerga improve on the musical
effect of the plump, unimpassioned tenor who
enters into bogus bonds of matrimony with Bel
Sorel. But in its dramatic aspects the opera
seemed to gain quite as much as it lost by the
changes. Amy Castles, like the more experi-
enced artist, is an unconvincing figure of a tea-
caddy charmer; but where her recitative chanting
was comparatively slow and conversational, she
made the story more intelligible. What may
have been crude in her acting was concealed by
a kimono, whilst her feeling for the charac-
ter was perceptible, and her facial expres-
sion, despite an amateurish make-up, had no
fault except- the trick of opening her
round eyes in a strikingly un-Japanese manner.
Miss Castles looked cheerfully confiding, whilst
John Zerga looked j ust the little bounder who would
capture her under false pretences if she knew no
better. Cho Cho San is astoundingly simple, all
things considered, and Melbourne, up to time of
writing, had not been deeply impressed by the
pathos of- a simplicity which seems impervious to
suspicion. This week will have brought to light
a third prima donna in Miss 'Pampari, the said-
to-be-ideal Mimi of “La Boh&me.” An ideal
Mimi should prove a sufficiently fragile Butterfly.

or, rather, the daughter of that bygone fishwife.
It is a capital old opera, and the amateurs, who
have promised to treat it kindly, will operate in
the good cause of a new surgical ward for the
Children’s Hospital. A week later (the 20th) the
Julius Knight-Katherine Grey co. starts a fare-
well season at the Princess’s in “ The Third
Degree.”

“ The Chance of a Lifetime,” being a con-
sistently horsey and ingenuous melodrama, is
going as strong as ever at the King’s. Nat
Gould, it seems, wrote a novel of the same name
(present writer once tried to read a Nat Gouldian
romance, but nearly perished in the attempt),
and many patrons of the King’s are enjoying the
drama because they had read the book, or are
reading the book because they saw the drama, and
mean to see it again when fully possessed of its
literary charm. So what with the book, and the
picture-posters, and the horse that walks up-
stairs, and the novelty of a drama with no bad
woman or superlatively good woman in it, “The
Chance of a Lifetime ” is going to last five weeks
anyhow. Probably the latter consideration sways
public opinion more than it supposes. A demand
for medium sort of girl in stage life has been
lately developing like a cabbage in the night.
Just ordinary girl, with only a fair amount of
in-no-cence.

Of all West’s Melbourne programme this
week. The Bulletin prefers “An Incident in
the Life of Marie Antoinette.” The episode is
unhistorical, but idyllic, and the pictures of Marie
would make heavenly posters for toilet soaps.
“ Over Silent Paths ” is a notable shriek of ven-
geance ; while “A Cowboy’s Devotion ” is suffici-
ently lovely to be put in a poem. “ Snow Sports
on Mount Kosciusko ” isn’t so exciting as “Seal
Hunting in Tasmania”; while “Betty and the
Fireworks ” supplies the wild “ comedy relief ”
that the flicker show, like the bellowdrama, must
apparently possess if it wants to make the box-
office happy. This mention of the West box-
office recalls that it wasn’t happy the other day
when it read its Bulletin and found that “ The
Animated Gazette ” and a few other of its Palace
triumphs had somehow slipped in to the credit of
Melbourne Olympia.

At the Opera House the activity of the
Kremo Family is unabated, and Mendel retains
his marvellous memory. But Mendel gives too
much piano. His blindness, though it makes him
wonderful, hasn’t made him a wonderfully fine
player; so one’s interest in his performance is
exhausted before he goes away. Grade Grahame
has just returned from Europe under the same old
special engagement to Mr. Rickards, which is a
matter for gladness. Gracie has decorative
frocks and pretty ways, and songs that only a
pleasing young person could sing with impunity.
In fact, the advt. hits the mark in calling her a
box of mischief. One of the ballads out of the
box is wrapped in blue tissue paper, and Gracie
handles it very daintily.
“ W.C.M.”: A “ Poverty Point” par. (B. 14/7/’10) men-
tions that one of Old Hingland’s noblemen—Viscount
Mountmorres—has been tacked on to a flickeraraph show
to announce the names of his cobbers’ carriages in the
King’s funeral procession pictures. When I last heard
of Mountmorres, he was on the staff of the. periodical
known as Answers, and as “ Mr. Answers ” performed
all sorts of desperate deeds—at a penny a line. On the
whole, knowing Answers, I should say that Mount-
morres has had a rise in the world, if the news about his
flicker-show engagement is true.
Brisbane’s new theatre is to be called the Empire.
Wonderfully original these playhouse-builders are. Some
day one of them will hit something as wildly new as (say)
the Royal or His (or Her) Majesty’s.
“ Wonga ” : As wheat growers, Australians have,
so far, been a pathetic failure, ranking amongst
the lowest averages in the world; and if the
recent conference of wheat growers, which sat in
Sydney to discuss dry farming, results in im-
proved methods of producing wheat crops, my
blessing upon it. The business of dry farming is
nothing extraordinary, Boiled down, it simply
means good farming. But it should be clearly
understood that it is not to be made another
lever to shunt the future cocky into the
forlorn back country, there to try and grow
wheat and raise Australians on an occasional
pannikin of rain. It may be quite true,
as Senator McColl came all the way from
Victoria to tell the conference, that the Yankees
are growing crops with eight inches or less of
rain. Also, it may not. But there is no occasion
to try that tough proposition while the Ma State
has millions of good wheat acres held tenaciously
by a few sheep kings who put them to amazingly
little purpose. So far, an area of about 2,000,000
acres is the most that N.S.W. has grown wheat
upon; while there are, according to experts,
about 25,000,000 acres of safe, productive country
—no eight-inch rainfall proposition—mostly mono-
polised by the very inefficient wool squatters and
similar obstacles.
’ “ The cottage was a thatched one
(Or so the poet said),
Jim’s counterpane a patched one,
And poor Jim—nearly dead.
But do you tnink he died, Sir?
(Don’t trust those writing men),
, Woods’ Peppermint Cure was tried, Sir,
And now he’s well again.*
AT POVERTY POINT.
Walter Bentley and Ancelon, of Sydney’s College of
Elocution, stage for the first time in any Australian city
theatre a romantic comedy-drama entitled “ For the
King.” It happens on Thursday and Friday nights. The
play is founded on the text: “ Greater love has no man
than this that a man lay down his life for his friend.”
The plan is at Paling’s.
“ Theorbo ” : There has not been such an operatic race
in Melbourne as that between Sorel and Castles since
Lyster produced “ L’Africaine.” On alternate nights the
principals were Lucy Escort and Squires, as against
Fanny Simonsen and Beaumont. When Barry Sullivan
challenged Booth as Hamlet, in America, the saying was:
“ Sullivan the actor. Booth the Hamlet.” Sol will sav:
“Castles the singer, Sorel the butterfly.” Yet the
warble of Sorel is good and the acting of Castles is good.
1 think Amy is better in a more ambitious role. Sorel is
exactly in the part, but lacks Amy’s organ. I would like
to see Amy in the first act and Bel in the second. Either
would suit me in the third.
“0.K.”: People who saw “The Passing of the Third
Floor Back” in London a while ago remark on the differ-
ence between the calm, impressive manner of Forbes
Robertson as the Stranger and the more pleadingly ingra-
tiative style of Matheson Lang. The former was monas-
tic, the latter is a glorified curate. One feels that he
doteson buttered toast and takes three pieces of sugar in
his tea. Matheson Lang is too pronounced in his saintli-
ness. Also the boarders whom he converts are mostly
exaggerations of their types. The Painted Lady sniggers
and sidles and flourishes her hands with absurd unna-
turalism. When she comes into the sitting-room to
sneak the candles she performs her secret thefts with
giddy antics, as though she were striking invisible
boarders with a feather. The landlady is the only person
who usually refrains from overdoing it, though her soli-
citude for the slavey’s health smacks of artificiality.
A one-act opera by George Clutsam, formerly of Mel-
bourne, was staged at Her Majesty’s, London, last week,
but seemingly it didn’t catch on. The cable said that
“the newspapers have published favorable notices of the
production,” but there is no mention of overwhelm-
ing applause from the audience. There is time for Clut-
sam to make headway, though. His little opera is titled
“ A Summer Night,” and the love scenes are said to be
rather sultry.
“Stargazer”: Why, oh, why do composers of grand
opera endeavor to supply idyllic and sylphlike heroines?
Why not content themselves with solid arid substantial
damsels, built on the very material lines of the average
soprano of 30? To be sure, the sentimental push adores
the idyllic and sylphlike; but, despite the romantic
intentions of the composers, the public never gets any-
thing more nearly approaching a sylph than can be sup-
plied by the ordinary I3st. songstress with a waist like a
keg of soda. Soprani accumulate adipose tissue. Bulki-
ness is apparently unavoidable. The exigencies of the
profession induce meat. Knowing this, the composer
who stages a heroine like ,Madame Butterfly makes
failure in one department of his great work a foregone
conclusion. Possibly there is a soprano somewhere on
earth who could realise Butterfly from the dramatic
point of view, but I have never seen her. Either of the
performers now operating in Melbourne needed a pre-
liminary three months’ training in a strict racing stable.
“Wang”: The average pleasure-surfeited city person
would be astounded at the capacity for enjoyment pos-
sessed by a bushy when he comes to town, say, at Show
time for a week’s holiday. As a rule, Bushy gets that
holiday only once per annum, and he proceeds’to pack
enough enjoyment into it to last him for the remaining
51 weeks. He has the pick of half a dozen plays, but he
manages to see most or all of them, and to wedge the
picture shows in between. If there happens to be a buck-
jumping or a woodchopping contest in the neighborhood
he feels in duty bound to go, and on his way he has a look
at the waxworks or the markets. Each day he steps out to
the Show for a few hours to see the animals and machinery,
and occasionally rides in one or other of the horse events.
As a rule, he isn't keen on parks or gardens, but if one hap-
pens to be near his place of temporary residence he finds
time to moon about its walks before breakfast. The
boxing match between the two alleged champion bruisers
must be witnessed, and the Sunflower Quadrille Assem-
bly has an even chance of remembering the bloke who
'was an orlright dancer. In the morning an hour is
filled in at the Public Library or the Art Gallery before
setting out f.or the races at Moonee Valley or Rosehill.
And, on top of it all, Bushy can get drunk every
blessed night. A lot Coster Fraser knew about the Aus-
tralian cove !
“Jack Caul ” : The motion picture showmen in Maori-
land are working under a full head of competition to
haul the public up to their pay-boxes. Thompson-Payne,
whose flicker machines are planted in about half a dozen
of the minor towns, baited his attractions with presenta-
tions of drinking utensils to local football teams and with
half-guinea weekly prizes for the best lines of doggerel
describing the various films. Then Hayward-Clark
butted in with half-guineas for essays, and medals and
free seats to hockey-players. T.-P, replied with two setsof
essays ;and H.-C. countered with a beauty competition for
children (photos, thrown on screen and £2 2s. prizie). This
was all right as far as it went, but what rankled in
H.-C.’s mind was that T.-P. held the record in Endurance
Idiots—one who had walloped the piano longer than any
other lunatic caged or at large. So H.-C. roped his
Maniac to a piano in the Masterton Town Hall and told
him to get busy. By a clause in the leasing contract the
hall had to be given up if it were wanted for other pur-
poses, and on one of the nights which was included in the
63hr. smin. record agony a shift had to be made to the
Volunteer Hall. It was the spectacle of a lifetime to see
the piano being conveyed from one building to the other,
with a Stout Person, muffled in an overcoat and hand
bandages, hanging on with his knees and. pounding out
“ Won’t you go home, Bill Bailey,” while the kids of the
town joined the procession. The last kid in the string
had his shirt hanging out, and that was my own opinion
of the Record Lunacy.
One Canon H. Burrows Southwell, an English social
purity enthusiast, smote the music-hall in a new place in
London Referee (12/6/’10). He wrote denying that he
had accused theatrical managers of “ darkening their
stages in order to hide the impurities that were allowed,”
and went on : “ What I actually did say was that by the
modern arrangement of things many of the performances
in music-halls and other similar places of amusement
were in darkened houses, and that acts of impurity were
indulged in under the cover of 4 ar kness.” Conceive the
appalling and insanitary state of a proboscis capable of
sniffing “impurity” in the temporarily-lowered lights of
a theatre. It makes one credit the bona-fides of an
amazing old social purity lady who told a Sydney paper
the other day that an erotic anecdote she had heard in
early youth “inflamed her imagination” for 15 years
afterwards. Canon H. Burrows Southwell ought to start
a crusade against railway tunnels, and insist on the loco-
motive always climbing over the top of the hill in order
to keep in the daylight. Who knows what dreadful
things may happen in tunnels ?
“Cockaigne”: H. B. Irving and Lttwrence Irving, the
brothers, were reared in boyhood by their mother, Sepa-
rated from her husband. She had been a Miss O’Oalla-
ghan, daughter of Surgeon-Major O’Callaghan,, of the
Indian army. Much annoyance was given to Irving by a
matinbe appearance of Mrs. Irving and her two sons, as
boys, at a London theatre. However, Irving took the
lads in hand later, and came to a more amicable settle-
ment with Mrs. Irving, though they never lived together
after about 1870. The sons received a first-rate educa-
tion. Lawrence, theyounger, named after John Lawrence
Toole, was pushed forward in business first. He went as
clerk, in St. Petersburg, to the branch of an English
firm. A successful performance there of John Mildmay,
in “Still Waters Run Deep,” turned him to the Stage,
and he has ever since been connected with it. He wrote
a drama called “ Peter the Great,” in which his father
acted at the London Lyceum. Henry Brodribb Irving,
the elder son, was destined by his father for the Bar, and
qualified for it in 1894, but never practised. He made
his first theatrical appearance as King John, at the Uni-
versity, with amateurs. His talent was unmistakable,
and his father appears to have reluctantly acquiesced in
his taking to the boards, but I do not think they ever
acted together. H.B. made a good foothold in London.
His father schooled him for Hamlet, and was gratified
with the excellent notices. Crichton, in Barrie’s play,
was the other most conspicuous London mark by H.B.
while his father lived. He published two able books,
“Life of Judge Jeffries” and “ Studies in Criminology.”
Married Miss Dorothea Baird, the original London Trilby
with Beerbohm Tree. A London magazine recently gave
photos., side by side, of father and son in “The Bells,”
“ Hamlet,” “ Charles 1.,” “ The Lyons Mail,” and “ Louis
XI.” From these it will be perceived that H.B.
does not slavishly copy his father even in make-up.
For instance, his Louis is older and uglier than his
father’s. In “The Bells ” the divergencies of acting are
considerable, and H.B. seems to accentuate more. In
“ The Lyons Mail ” it is said that H.B. is superior to his
father as the amiable Lesurques, but inferior in the vil-
lainous Dubose. Stripped of make-up, you ' note the
difference in the two Irvings. Take “Spy’s ” H.B. in the
World. A remarkably sprightly, frank-looking gentle-
man, with large, bright, sparkling eyes—a smiling em-
bodiment of good luck and cheeriness. Nothing of th t
triste and morne, almost sinister, look of the elder
Irving. Long years of disappointment don’t wear off a
man. He will not have the aspect of the one born with
the silver spoon in his mouth.
“ Kodak” : I always associate concerts with cold feet.
There isn’t a comfortable concert hall in Sydney or Mel-
bourne ; and as all the concerts are held during the
winter, the habitual concert-goer of these cities is a sort
of paying martyr. When, garbed in my thin evening
suit, I seat myself on a hard, Vienna chair and feel a
draught like an icy cataract pouring down my neck and
dragging at my feet, I am so amazed at my own enthusi-
asm for music that I almost cease shivering. Usually
the management supplies a large blanket-like programme
with the words of the songs, which are generally of an
ardent or burning variety. I suppose it is meant to take
the chill off ; but it doesn’t —not worth a cuss. Some-
times I get warmed up a bit with enthusiasm ; but I
have not yet heard the love-song I long for—the one
that will warm my extremities after I have been sitting
in a sea of draughts for half an hour. At times my hoofs
get so cold that I lose all interest in them, and allow
perfect strangers to tramp over them and rub the polish
off my boots. At such frozen moments I can take a calm,
dispassionate view of my own terminations, and the
stranger’s apologies or protests don’t matter. Lord only
knows how the low-necked females live through concerts.
It is the most irritating thing in the world to see a woman
who feels chilly, twitching a transparent scarf, that looks
like three-penn’orth of rarefied comet’s tail, round a pair
of heavyweight shoulders that are going blue for the
want of a good, honest blanket. The proceeding is so
futile that it fills one with a cold rage. Some of the rage
flies to the things I stand on, and helps to make
them still deader. Last concert I went to the star
sang a song which was all about feet. Someone
was passionately begging to be allowed sit at the
ends of the beloved and caress them. It reminded me
that I, too, had possessed some feet when I first arrived
at the hall.' I looked down at the bundlesof feet adjacent
and sorted out a pair that looked like the ones on which
I had walked into town. When the star had retired
amidst the inevitable storm of applause,! dragged them
out of the place and proceeded home with extreme care
and some doubt; they looked all right, but they felt so
fearfully wooden that I almost felt convinced that I had
come away with somebody else’s. When I arrived home,
I partially boiled them and found, to my great relief, that
I was legally entitled to them ; they were my feet, all
right. Isn’t it possible to have hot air as well as hot
arias?
London has had one of its frequent comic theatrical
lawsuits. A Captain Jay was thrown out, whereupon he
sued a palace of varieties for damages. Plaintiff said he
had had his face cut and his thumb dislocated, wherefore
he was now unable to write poetry. It was admitted
that he and his friends in a box gave a comedian “back
chat” ; but they said he began it. “No music-hall singer
nowadays asks the audience to interrupt him,” said the
manager solemnly ; but the Judge, not being of the
brand which affects ignorance, met him with: “Don't
talk nonsense. Mr. Wilkie Bard induced the whole audi-
ence to interrupt him at Drury Lane.” The barracked
comedian said that the box-party shouted, as soon as he
started : “ Rotten ! Get off ! ” made noises like a motor-
horn, and dropped lighted matches among the audience.
So he remarked to the gallery : “ When you see sardines
in a box they are usually well oiled.” He added in Court:
“Perhaps it was a slander on sardines. They are not
rowdy even when they are fresh.” The jury found that
it was right to eject the Captain, but wrong to throw him
out on to his ear and his thumb ; and it struck an unex-
pected note of seriousness by giving him £lOO.

Stand over.... By my halidame, at last,
From all my histrionic triumphs grand
Respite I gain to ponder o’er my past,
Upon the land.
Long years I yearned. Well, I remember how:
A cow ! A cow ! My kingdom for a cow !
And now my fondest dream is realised....
Woa! Steady, 8a1dy.... In the tinsel show
Of make believe no more I strut disguised
As So-and-so.
Nay, here I am myself without disguise....
Confound you ! Keep your tail out of my eyes!
My eyes! Ah yes, the girls at matinees
Praised well my eyes. And yet, what boots it now?
Those foolish vanities of other days. . . .
Stand over, cow !
Still, thoughts will come, here in my solitude. . . .
I wonder what’s put Darky off her food?
Yes, thoughts will come. And ah, how vividly
I still can picture each triumphant sight,
And hear the loud applause. I still can see
That great first night
When I played Hamlet in the dear old Cri. . . ,
By Jove, I hope old Spot’s not going dry !
Ah, that applause ! ’Tis unction to the soul
Of any act-or. Yet, what matter now? '
Away with such desires ! for now my goal. . . .
Stand over, cow !
That welcome sound ! Shall e’er I hear it more—
The clapping hands, the feet upon the floor?
Another finished, and three more to milk.
Heigh-ho ! This labor less keen joy affords
Than when, bewigged and clad in shining silk,
I trod the boards.
Now dungarees. .. . But stay. What folly’s this?
Yet, surely there is something that I miss?
What is it—this vague something that I crave—
This strange, insistent yearning in my blood?
My silent cows look on with faces grave,
And chew the cud.
And, a 9 I set each bucket down, I pause.
For what? . . . Gadzooks ! I’m waiting for applause !
I’m waiting for applause. Ah, woe is me !
This the unhappy act-or’s heritage!
The craving that o’ercomes a man if he
Once walks the stage.
M.y cattle gaze with apathetic eyes,
And my performance none will recognise.
Out on you ! Unappreciative beast!
Cannot my act appeal to such as you ?
Will not you stamp upon the stall, at least,
Or gently “ moo ”?
O, for the dear dead days of paint and wigs. . . .
Odds bodikins ! I didn’t feed the pigs 1

NEVER NEGLECT A COLD.
A cold should never be treated lightly, as it is
always more or less serious. Many people make
the mistake of neglecting a cold until some serious
lung trouble result. If every cold received the
attention it should have, the danger of this would
be avoided. Every cold can be cured by the use
of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. A bottle or two
of this remedy taken when the cold is first con-
tracted will promptly cure it, and not only save
.doctors’ bills, but much suffering and annoyance
■later on.*

PENFOLD'S
WINES
“Yachtsman ” : The call of duty strikes
different people different ways. The wayitstruck
one man in the Richmond (Vic.) railway smash
staggered me afterwards when I had time to
think about it. Almost as soon as the crash was
over, some of the Uninjured were hard at work
helping those who hadn’t come through so well.
The hero, however, pulled himself out of the
wreck, and amid the screams and the chaos asked
if the other lines were clear, because if they
weren’t he would be late at the office.
* * * *
The Rev. Harry Joyce, Congregational
pastor at Prahran (Vic.), points out with great
unction that if a certain parishioner of his had
not stopped to family prayers, he would have
caught the train that was wrecked at Richmond.
The Bulletin can present an equally true, though
perhaps less pious-looking, bill. A certain young
man used to have a clerical billet in Melbourne,
and travelled regularly from Brighton to the city
by the train that came to such awful grief. In
his spare time he wrote verses for The Bulletin,
and at last the paper invited him to join the staff!
He did so, and has since given up going to church
and become greatly demoralised by bad associa-
tions, though his verse is as good as ever. So he
didn’t happen to be killed at Richmond, but it
wasn’t family prayers that saved him.
* * * *
Apparently the Victorian railway regula-
tions are still the same hypocrisy they were in the
days of Sunshine. In the Richmond inquiry the
enginemen’s counsel hinted that some of the fog-
signalling posts were not filled on the morning of
the smash. Then :
The Chairman ; Is it suggested that the Department
should place certain men at certain positions?
Mr. Corr(for the enginemen): The regulations provide
that it should be done.
Mr. McArthur (for the Commissioners) : You know it
would be absurd to make it mandatory.
So this is another of the regulations provided
to smooth the track for the Department in the
event of accident, like the charming one that
instructs suburban guards not to keep their trains
longer than half a minute at stations. That also
isn’t mandatory. It is simply damnatory—of the
policy that dictated it.
* * * *
It can’t always be the fault of the signal-
man, anyhow. Within a fortnight of the Rich-
mond (Vic.) smash an engine ran off the line at
Wandin station ; three carriages were derailed at
Flinders-street; an engine broke down at Foot-
seray ; the Adelaide express just missed disaster ;
the Sydney express got its side scraped and
windows broken ; the Geelong mail train broke in
two just as it reached its destination, whereby the
whole Western service was dislocated for half a
day ; an engine ran off the rails at Stawell, a
truck at Walhalla, and another engine at Wandin.
Nobody was injured or even killed ; but the
System seems to be keeping its hand in.
* * * *
The “claitns settlement” tactics of the
Victorian Railway Department present a very
bluffsome and bounceable appearance in the case
of the twice-injured girl—Miss Reddish—who was
induced to accept £5O compensation after the
Sunshine accident. Since the Richmond
smash she has been lying at a private hospital,
where she was promptly taken from her mother’s
home on the advice of the doctor who was called
in to attend her. The doctor, seemingly,
is now acting as agent for the Railway De-
partment, and last week, after having sum-
moned a gathering of four other medical
men to a further examination of the girl’s
damaged state he told her he was authorised
to offer her £lOO to settle the case. The patient
was then in a sufficiently active frame of mind
to refuse the offer with scorn, though she
next day lapsed into semi-unconciousness. The
doctor finding the £loobait no good, suggested that
£350 might be obtained if she threatened an
action, and laid the damages at, say, £700; but
he affected to ridicule the mere idea of her getting
more than that. All of which conversation being
duly reported to the patient’s brother he wrote
to Commissioner Tait, giving notice that if
any settlement of her case be forced upon her,
whilst she is under the care of the doctor aforesaid,
he will take proceedings to have it “set aside
on the ground of fraud in which the
claims agent has participated.” It would be
an interesting event if some excuse arose for
examining one of these remarkable Melbourne
doctors on oath, and asking him how he came to
be an agent for the railway department; for
what reason he proceeded to bluff and worry his
own patient, who would probably have been much
better left to complete repose, into hastily and
without consideration accepting a mere trifle ; and,
in a general way, where he came in anyhow ?
INDISPUTABLE.

The Christian Scientist has been at it
again, and, as usual, the child is dead. It is one
of the fatalities of the Christian Science curse
that, however sudden the head of the house-
hold may be in shouting for a doctor when
he is ill himself, he generally lets his children
go without medical attendance, and gives them
the prayer treatment till they pass out.
A question arises, hereabouts, whether Christian
Science shouldn’t be made a notifiable disease,
the same as tuberculosis. At the very least,
Christion Science families should be registered,
and the Health Department should periodically
inspect. them for signs of illness, also school-
teachers, employers and policemen should be in-
structed to report any sign of sickness among
Christian Science offspring, so that they can be
promptly removed to the hospital out of the old
man’s reach. It would probably be too drastic to
suggest that unregistered Christian Scientists
should be destroyed, or taken to a depdt and sold
if not claimed, the same as dogs ; but the penalty
for non-registration should be heavy. Also,
the heads of the sect should be put on
the list of people whose letters will not be
delivered, and their telephone communications
should be cut off. These precautions might tend
to prevent the spread of a creed which is all right
in theory, but is lamentably destructive to Young
Australia in practice. As a further precaution,
Christian Scientists might be declared undesirable
immigrants, and the books of Mrs. Baker Eddy,
the founder of the cult, might be prohibited under
the Thistle Act or something of the sort. In
Victoria, at all events, almost anything may be
declared a thistle within the meaning of the Act.

“ Bloggs ” writes :
According to the Kalgoorlie Miner (4/7/T0)
“ The jury which inquired into the causes surrounding
the death of William Powell, who was killed at the Cool-
gardie racecourse on June 29, returned a verdict that
deceased ‘was killed whilst riding in a hurdle race at
Ooolgardie Racecourse on Wednesday, June 29, and the
cause of his death arose from injuries received when his
horse accidentally fell with him. The jury wish to state
that in their opinion some power should be vested in the
stewards to enable them to withdraw any horse, at any
part of a race, that they may think unsafe or Unfit to
race.’ The rider," so the Miner goes on, “ has caused
considerable comment among racing men, who consider
that it would be impossible to carry it into effect.”
In regard to the sentence in italics, I (“ Bloggs ’’ above
mentioned) arise to ask why ? The average rider weighed
in with by the average jury is lamentably impracticable
and ill-considered. Not so this one, according to my
point of view, and I have seen something of the jumping
game. It is a matter of notoriety among horsemen, not
only that the tired horse is the one which is most apt to
blunder, but that it is the tired horse that gives th,e worst
sort of fall when it does come down. The reason is pretty
obvious. The unfortunate brute, having lost all interest
in the proceedings,'owing to excessive fatigue, crashes
down in a heap and without the slightest attempt to fall
clear of its rider. The rider over fences will always be-
stride a thoroughbred if he can. The reason is that
the thoroughbred has a great heart. It does not know
when it is done, and will jump on long after
the equally well-conditioned commoner has thrown it
up, and collapsed on its pilot. Now, in racing, there is
an insane rule or custom or superstition which enjoins
that every horse must be “ persevered with ” to the last.
It is that practice which accounts for about two-thirds of
the bad falls that occur.
Any intelligent judge knows from the stand when a
steeplechaser has shot its bolt. There is no reason in
the world why stipendiary stewards shouldn’t be sta-
tioned at various points around the course, with
authority to order any rider to pull up when his
mount is in obvious difficulties. Prompt action of the
sort would be calculated not only to save the wearied
steed and its skipper from disaster, but would act as a
safeguard to the other participants in the race as well.
“ Anti-Death ” writes :
A Glebe (Sydney) grocer has been fined £7 under the
Pure Poods Act for selling a Yankee notion, labelled
“ St. Charles’ Evaporated Cream—Good for Babies." Ex-
pert analysis deposed that the decoction was concen-
trated skimmed milk, and there was grave doubt even
as to its honesty as skimmed milk. Anyhow, as food
for infants it was beyond doubt dangerous. The defence
was that the stuff was sold just as purchased 18 months
previously from “a leading wholesale house” (name of
house suppressed by the daily newspapers out of re-
spect), but as the retail price was only 4jd., while local
cream was selling at 9d. for the same quantity, the
grocer seemed called upon to make some inquiries.
Having failed to do that his case calls for little sympathy.
But the worst offender seems to be the leading
wholesale house, and by-and-bye somebody will rise and
ask in a loud voice why the Pure Food Act has got such
a derry on the small grocer and the struggling sauce
factory that it can’t find time to drop in occasionally
upon leading wholesale houses. In fact, I produce the
loud question now. When it is told where the small
offender obtains his health-destroying rubbish, why
doesn’t the Pure Pood, Act go round to the distributing
warehouse and confiscate it (the rubbish) before it can
be ipushed up country away from the Act’s beat? I’d
be grateful for the information.

A MEETING OF LIBERALS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For over an hour last night the North Sydney School of
Arts echoed a pandemonium of noise that would have
done credit to the most exciting of League football
matches. The air was literally thick with boo-hoos, cat-
calls, ludicrous shouts and other demoniacal din. Itwas
a meeting of the St. Leonards branch of the Liberal and
Reform League. . . . Before the business commenced, an
incident occurred at the door which manifested that
feeling was going to be high. A wordy conflict between
an executive officer of the league and the doorkeeper
culminated in an impromptu wrestling match. There
was some jostling, and someone in the crowd angrily
exclaimed: “Mind who you’re shoving.”— Evening

A cheap and easy method of lending a
temporary immortality to the names of the
“illustrious dead” of Victoria is proposed by
Charles Atkins, whose suggestion seemingly was
inspired by the foolishness of a movement to erect
a statue, or something, to the late L. L. Smith.
Atkins proposes that granite or marble panels be
placed outside the walls of Melbourne down
Hall, to be engraved with the names of those
“who have deserved, and are yet to deserve
honor from the people of Victoria.” City men
of the practical order, like Atkins, are sub-
ject to these absurd ideas. If tablets were
stuck on the Town Hall for the purpose of
being covered with names, every citizen who had
ever worn a belltopper would get there within
the next 20 years. Future generations would
merely throw mud at the long lists of forgotten
Smiths, Browns and Joneses who had received post
mortem mention from a chisel. As matters stand
the people are safeguarded from memorials to
their “ illustrious dead,” as Charles Atkins calls
them, by cash' considerations. The cost of a
statue, or even a drinking fountain, is more than
the friends of the recently-deceased candidate
for fame will run to. But if the Order
of the Tablet could be conferred at a cost of 10
“bob” on every late citizen whom the gaud
Mayor and Council delighted to honor, the
situation would be different. In this matter, the
R.C. Church is wise in its generation. No person,
of however good repute, is qualified to become a
saint until at least 50 years after death. If a
similar law were applied in the case of statues,
memorial tablets, and so on, it would have a
sobering effect on the monumental mason and
the man who boils metal and casts images. A
person whose case seems to call for a statue when
he has been dead half a century probably deserves
a statue.

Melbourne possesses a benevolent Judge
in Cresswell, P.M. Lately he considered a man
who stole a lump of soap from a fashionable pub.
The grease was valued at one penny, so Cresswell
had to think of a punishment to fit the crime.
After recalling the size of the soap and the size of
the pub, he held that seven days’ gaol would be
sufficient. Really, Cresswell is too lenient. He
should have ordered the felon to return the soap.

A certain wholesale order for drink which
lecturer Joseph McCabe gave in one of the
“dry” towns of Maoriland will be a landmark in
the Dominion’s history. McCabe generally con-
sumed one glass of beer after a lecture, and on
this occasion he gave the order as usual. Then
he was informed that the town was No-License ;
that it was a place where there had been a great
moral upheaval in the anti-Drink interest; and
that he could buy two gallons of beer if he liked,
hut no retail orders were accepted. Two gallons was
the bedrock minimum, but if he wanted more he
could purchase anything up to a herd of breweries.
Joseph pondered deeply over this amazing mani-
festation of the teetotal spirit, and then ordered
the two gallons. He had his usual allowance,
and distributed the rest, to the great further-
ance of temperance. Maoriland is getting
on well with its No-License policy. The
hotels in the “dry” regions are, in the main,

gloomy, slovenly and down at heel. Since
they lost the protits of the bar trade thev have
had to economise to make ends meet—to"econo-
inise in service in food in soan in lannHrv in
mise m service, in roou, in soap, in laundry, in
window-cleaning and m sundries. Meanwhile
the wholesale grog-dealers are growing rich, and
clubs thrive, and there are multitudinous sly-
drinkeries where mere youths of 16 and 17 learn
to tipple gaily. The old publican, as a rule,
didn’t serve infants like these because he feared
to lose his license, but the sly-grog man who has
risen on liis ruins can serve anybody, for he has
no license to lose. His chief disadvantage is that
If « client o-ets reallv tiedit be bn« to bo K eol„Herl
it a client gets really tight he has to be secluded
till he so far lecovers that he can go home in
safety, else he might babble to the police—that is,
of course, if it is a drinkery which hasn’t squared
the police. McCabe was moved to investigate all
these things after the amazing episode of the
teetotal town where he had to buy two gallons of
beer, and Maoriland has sent an eloquent mis-
sioner hack to England to tell of its great and
wonderful No-License joke.
The Richmond (Vic.) railway disaster
spelt bad luck for the widows of three victims of
the one at Beaufort. The department had at last
offered them compensation to the extent of three
years’ wages—three years being, presumably, the
average expectation of life among Tait’s em-
ployees. The offer was so miserly that some
M’s.L.A. were to have discussed it in the
House; but, after Richmond, it looked
too much like kicking a man when
he was down.
ONE REASONABLE EXPLANATION.
HENRY : “So you think she is marrying me for
my money?”
ALICE : “ Well, the woman must have some
reason.”
Augustus Roe, the plain-spoken magistrate
of Perth (Westralia), had a tough customer to
deal with in the police court, the other day. The
customer was a young woman of 28, an assisted
English immigrant, who had become infatuated
with an Afghan, and was living as “companion-
help ” with another Afghan’s missus. The police
had argued with her, and once or twice had per-
suaded her to quit the Afghan house ; but she
broke away every time. She took refuge in a
story that her Mahomed had promised to
marry her and take her off to India, and
then on to his parents’ home. Finally, Roe
tried his hand at arguing ; and when the
lady declared that she had written to h<\r
parents to find out what they thought
about it, he offered her the choice of a home
or gaol until an answer came. To that
suggestion she said briefly that nothing
but gaol would keep her from her Ma-
homed ; so Roe made it gaol. But accord-
ing to the lengthy reports of the case pub-
lished in Perth, nobody seems to have
inquired into a statement made by the
young woman that she was sent to the
Afghan house, at 15s. a week, from the
Immigrants’ Home—the place that the
“assisteds” camp at when they are fresh in
the country. It may have been a lie ; but
if it wasn’t, then the conduct of the Immi-
grants’ Home wants investigation, and a gun
looks a handy thing to investigate with.
The stiffest, also the most persistent, pro-
blem that faces the English Foreign-trade news-
paper nowadays is to reconcile its news items
with the arguments in its leading columns. As
an instance, Lloyd’s recently put the case against
German Protection this way
In appearance, the boulevard and the German cigar-
maker and his family denote prosperity, but it is pros-
perity at the price of legitimate comfort, nutritious food,
and the conditions of a healthy home. We are far from
assuming that by this comparison the lot of the British
worker leaves nothing to be desired ; but, as Mr. Baker,
in his own forcible way, puts it, “the problem of Eng-
land’s unemployed is a far smaller one than that of
Germany’s employed. John Bull has less polish, but
more rump steak,” and with Mr. Baker we prefer to stick
to the system that ensures for us the latter to the one
that compels many of our friends on the other side of the
North Sea to live on horse-flesh and potatoes.
On the next page appeared the following:—
Lord Robert Cecil told a pathetic story at the annual
meeting of the Maternity Charity and District Nurses’
Home, Plaistow, at the Mansion House, on Wednesday.
A man got up at three o’clock in the morning, ate a
piece of. bread, walked from West Ham to Willesden for
a day’s work, had to wait till the night, worked through-
out the night, and got ss.
Then he walked home, having had nothing to eat since
he left the previous morning. He gave the ss. to his
wife, who had to spend 4s. 6d. on rent.
It is hard to imagine a German, however pol-
ished, with less rump-steak than that Willesden
J. Bull would be able to buy with •the change
that was left him after his wife had paid the rent,
and he had consumed his first meal in 30 hours.
Apropos a recent pur. about the absurdity
of the frequent alleged centenarian, it transpires
that the Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York
once had one of the species.on its books, or firmly
believes it had. His name was Charles H. Booth
and he was insured in the Oifice for 66 years or
thereabouts. His pegging-out is recorded as
having happened at the age of 100 years, 7
months and 29 days. Out of the hundreds of
thousands of carefully-selected people whom the
Mutual Life has insured there was never another
centenarian, and only five of its policy-holders
sver drifted past the 96th mile. post. When
Charles Booth decided that it was a fair thing
and gave up the game, the co. was so
deeply interested that it m ide
inquiry among the other life
otfices of the world to see
if they could match its
curio. It heard of one
centenarian in Europe,
and that was all. Yet
so exceedingly light and
airy are some of the
people who collect cen-
tenarians, that The Bul-
letin recently received
a letter from a man who
staled quite cheerfully
that there were five of
them in his district, the
oldest being aged 107.
Also, the Melbourne Ace
(25/7/TO) remarked casu-
ally that nine centen-
arians had died in
Australia during the
first three months of
1910 (five of them in
the little State of Vic-
toria), and that the
most remarkable of
them was one hun-
dred and thirteen (113)
years old. This is at
the rate of 36 cen-
tenarians per annum.
It is time Parliament
interfered and abol-
ished centenarians.

“Lantana”: Ethel
Le Neve, the girl who
fled from London with
Hawley orip p e n,
when that personage
put up the first great
race on earth against
wireless telegraphy
and lost, is just the
same old kind of girl that hangs her faith and her
clothes to a safety-pin. The skipper of the boat
by which the pair bolted says he saw Miss Le
Neve (who was disguised as a boy) without her
coat and waistcoat, and noticed that her ill-fitting,
trousers were held at the waist with the imple-
ments already mentioned. That was enough for
the observant mariner. He’d seen them hitched
with a nail and with string and with a bootlace,
but never with a safety-pin. Strange how woman
swears by the safety-pin, despite the worry and
trouble it causes. It is the prop and mainstay
of her existence, the anchor of her clothes. Take
it from her, and her garments fall off, and she has
to flee into the bath and lather herself for conceal-
ment. If Miss Le Neve had used a belt to keep
the lower half of her surroundings in place, and
if Crippen had not shown his well-known false
teeth at the skipper’s joke, perhaps the pair
would have given the detectives the slip. But
the whole thing was a bungle. When a man is
badly wanted by the police, the best course is to
go and enlist. The British army will take
almost anybody nowadays, and all soldiers look
alike, the same as Chinamen.

The jaunty Judkins, who is Melbourne’s
most journalistic wowser, has scored again off the
local police. Ever since the days of the scandal-
ous protected tote he has scored off the police
when they took up the bowling, and his latest
boundary hit is very clean and hard. It happened
this way : The Argos, having practically accused
the police of sanctioning a big hazard school in
the city, the Age naturally denied that the
academy referred to had any existence, and
quoted statements of the police to the effect that
Judkins, who had been preaching on the Argus
text, was unable to give information of the
“school’s” whereabouts when challenged to do
so. Thereupon Jud. gave his account of wowser-
dom’s position in the matter: —
Your reporter states that I refused to give the name of
the gaming house “because I had been pledged to
secrecy.” This is quite incorrect. The detective called
at my office and began establishing his position by a
straight-out denial that there was any such place. My
facts were contradicted, my authorities scorned, and the
attitude of my visitor was one more of derision than any-
thing else. I was asked for the names of my informants,
that the detective might “cross-examine” them, and I
replied that I never gave my informants away. The
treatment members of the social reform party have re-
ceived at the hands of the police authorities has not
encouraged us to do more than point out evils that exist.
Whilst he was about it Judkins might have
touched on the fact that it was the Argus and
not he who had first talked about the gambling
school, and that is was up to Chief Commissioner
O’Callaghan to prove that the newspaper had
been “shielding law-breakers” from the sleuth-
hounds of the law.
PUSHING BUSINESS.
BODYSNATOHER: “’Ow’s the wife?”
JONES : “ Very bad.”
BODYSNATCHER : " Sorry to ’ear it. I ’opes when
the — er—worst 'appens you won’t forget me.”
“ The Old Man With Grey Hair,” who is
distributing bogus bank notes in Sydney and sub-
urbs, is still coming it strong, despite Police In-
spector-General Garvin’s infuriated chivvy ingof his
department. Recently a rumor was circulated that
the undiscovered traveller with the waste-paper
was a police officer in disguise—which is a
common rumor in N.S.W. when crimes have
defied detection for a considerable time. When
Gardiner, the bushranger, defeated repeated
attempts at capture, it was communicated to the
Government, as a dark secret, that he and Sir
Frederick Pottinger, police inspector of the
western district, were one and the same person.
Pottinger, a baronet of elongated lineage, had
buried himself out-back as a trooper, but inquiries
from England enlightened the Government as to
his social tonnage, and he was at once promoted
to an inspectorship. Jealousy may have helped
to inspire the subsequent rumor as to his duality
with the bushranger, but Pottinger pursued Gar-
diner so inefficiently and missed so many chances
that there was room for a lot of picturesque
doubt. At last the cloud of suspicion hung so
thickly over the cranium of Ferdinand the
Baronet that he was ordered to report himself at
headquarters. On his way to Sydney, however,
his revolver went off and there was no more
Pottinger. And he wasn’t Gardiner after all.

Who owns the runs afar,
Where the rotting townships
And useless railways are,
Punish not Thy servant
For his greed and vice;
Let some other traveller
Be the sacrifice.
Lord of politicians
Of an olden day,
They who built the railways
That never, never pay,
Visit not Thy vengeance
On my guiltless head ;
Let some Tory traveller
Pay the cost instead.
Lord, Who knoweth in what year
The car in which I sit
Was built, and that it runneth still
To meet the deficit,
Hold its planks together, Lord,
Stay its crazy bolts ;
Let some godless traveller
Bear the shocks and jolts.
Lord, Who knoweth who’s to blame
For the railway smash,
Thou Who marketh how they scheme
To make up squandered cash,
If Thou still ordainest
A sacrifice must be,
Hold it till a latent rain—
Mercy, Lord, on me !
Lord, Who made the Fatman
Who grabbl'd, for sake of cash,
The land that made the deficit
That made the railway smash,
Send Thou not Thy lowly folk
To be the sacrifice ■ —
They that sin the sin, 0 Lord,
Should surely pay the price.

“ Wonga ” : Owing to the fact that the
emu is suspected of spreading the prickly swear
in parts of Queensland, protection has been with-
drawn from him altogether, and the only welcom-
ing hand stretched out to him now is a gun.
While there is no doubt that the bird, which all
good Australians regard as a brother, eats the
pear fruit and, later, spreads the seed, it will be
hard luck if he is cleaned out. Sentiment has
little influence in the matter, however, where
the cactus pursues its exasperating and ruinous
way, and those who are suffering from its
perambulations find it hard to spare anything that
helps to drag the porcupine vegetable around the
country. Incidentally, it is a scandal that so
little effort is being made in N.S.W. to prevent
the spread of the prickly. It is working round
the north and north-west and west with an
energy worthy of a better curse ; and up Gilgan-
dra way, for instance, it is increasing wholesale
on Government land.
NOT THAT KIND OF THIRST.
CHRISTIAN BROTHER: “Misguided man , do you
really suppose that that pot of poison is going
to quench your thirst ?”
MISGUIDED ONE: “I ’opes not, Mister; I ’opes
not! ”
“ Caber ” : “Scapegoat” (B. 21/7/TO)
hurls a gibber at me because I asserted the utter
and irredeemable uselessness of prickly pear. In
what part of a pear-cursed State did he save
drought-stricken cattle with boiled pear chuff?
It must have been in a locality where the plaiit
doesn’t wear spines; or perhaps it was a spe-
cially prepared breed of iron cows he inflicted it
on. We chaffed, baked, fried and boiled prickly
pear for cattle feed during the 1902 drought, and
the only difference perceptible was that the cattle
fed on pear and molasses died a few weeks sooner
than those that didn’t join in the gorge. The
first attempt to put pear to a practical use as
fodder was made by a farmer near Clifton (Q.)
about 30 years ago. He boiled it and mixed it
with flour as pig-feed. The pigs died in less than
a fortnight; but, like “Scapegoat,” he stuck to
it that the vegetable porcupine wasn’t to blame
and that the flour did it. In short, the curse
may be a commercial asset in a hundred different
ways which have hitherto escaped notice ; but as
a fodder for even vegetarian devils it has been a
withering calamity.
TAKING NO RISKS.
MRS. BOSS COCKY : "Here, my pore man, is some bread an jam fer cuttin’ the wood.”
SWAGMAN : "All right, mum! Don't let wan o' them grasshoppers snavel it while I puts on
me coat.”
“ Yeria ” : “Vigilans” (B. 14/7/TO) is in
error. Melville Island is not sold to an English,
or any other, co. E. O. Robinson is still the
owner, though he has sold an option to a possible
purchaser, and he is still steadily exporting
hides. “Vigilans” is also wrong in giving the
annual rent at £3O. It is £lso—though even at
that figure it is a gift. I fail to see why cattle
and horses cannot be raised in the Territory, and
more especially on Melville Island, which has a
splendid rainfall, is well grassed, heavily tim-
bered (not scrub) and has good harborage and
rivers. During my sojourn in the Territory
many hundreds of cattle were shipped to Java
and Singapore (at a large profit), and, given
decent shipping facilities, the country is good
enough to send thousands of real good beasts
away. Ask Kidman what he thinks of the
Territory as a cattle country. Sisal hemp is an
unqualified success on Melville Island, and should
be the same on the mainland ; ditto rice, and
there’s every reason to believe that both cotton
and rubber would do well. The buffalo is a fine
animal, but the future of the Territory in general,
and Melville Island in particular, lies in the culti-
vation of the above plants and also in raising
cattle for export. There’s a market close handy for
as much rice as can be grown, and a growing de-
mand for meat all over Eastern Asia. Given a
railway and good shipping facilities the Cinder-
ella of the Commonwealth would rapidly arrive
at the Princess stage.

“Machete”: Permit me, before other
Papuan liars fall upon my neck and call me
accursed, to correct a mistake in my par re “the
Colored Dunns” (B. 23/6/TO). Therein a printer’s
error—due no doubt to my infernal handwriting
—makes the name of the Mekeo magistrate,
murdered by his policeman, appear as “Guhan-
etti,” instead of “ Giulianetti.” Giulianetti, “a
Macgregor man,” was an Italian, who came to
Papua with that stark explorer I)’Alberto, the
famous, not to say notorious, tracer of the
Fly River. Giulianetti was a man who did
much fine work for his side in the days
when an R.M.’s work in the Isle of
Unrest was a burden to stagger most men.
There was also one other, whose death may, per-
haps, be laid to the door of the A.N.C. That is
Green, the first resident magistrate of the
Northern Division, who was murdered at Tamata
with his police by the Mambare natives in 1897.
The plot whereby the apparently friendly natives
brought about his undoing was instigated by
Durnai, a bobby, constable or cop, who had been
taken by Governor Macgregor from the Mam-
bare some six months previously, and later
returned, when Green was appointed, to his own
people as trap or colored Dunn and interpreter.
It takes two years to “make” a good infantry
private in European armies. If Dumai had had
the benefit of that extra 18 months he might have
proved worthy of it and the fine force he be-
longed to.
* * * *
“Eungella”: “Sil”(B. 28/7TO) had his
leg pulled if he was told there was any explorer’s
mark on the bit of tree at Medlow (N.S.W.).
The bit there is the top half of the vegetable, and
no sane explorer would mark that end. The part
that was marked still stands at the turn-off to the
Jenolan Caves, on the Bathurst-road, and is pro-
tected. Therefore, if it amuses the guileless
bounder and his girl to decorate the Hydro bit —
why, let them. I admit that my own humble
moniker is there—written on the back of Mrs.
Snob-Smith’s card, torn from the tree. Poor
Mrs. Snob-Smith !
“Pick”: The lonesome and unburied
dead in the byways of the Australian wilds are
sometimes responsible for curious cases of mis-
taken identity. Some years ago two diggers
found a dead man in Tim’s Gully, Shoalhaven
River (N.S.W.). An old fossicker in those parts
was, at the time, missed from the locality, and it
was concluded that the corpse was his property.
A decent burial for the old fellow was decided
upon, and among those who attended
the funeral there turned up the man
whose name was on the coffin-plate.
Then again, at Bungarby (N.S.W.),
back in the ’eighties, a sheep-stealer,
for whom cookies and police had long
been on the watch, was surprised while
sampling a flock at night, and chased
over the cliffs which thereabouts wall
in the Snowy River. He escaped, but
a fortnight later a decomposing body
found under the cliffs was duly in-
quested and buried with the stigma of
thief thick upon it. The jumbuck-
lifter was subsequently met by an ac-
quaintance in Queensland. When told
that he was dead and buried, he
said that he was very glad, and flatly
refused to dig himself up. A German
and a Swede were once employed as
digger - mates, near Tumbarumba
(N.S.W.). The German disap-
peared, and because much of the pro-
perty known to be his remained in the
possession of the Swede, suspicions
were aroused. When, about two years
later, a skeleton was unearthed in the
gully where the mates had worked, the
circumstantial evidence was reckoned
good enough for police investigation,
and the unfortunate Swede was
placed under close surveillance. He
might have been placed under the
gallows later on, but an officer
with more brains than the rest went out into
the world and dredged up the German, alive
and well. As a final instance, last year a suicide’s
pathetic letter, found beside a waterhole near
Bombala, appeared to identify the writer with an
eccentric itinerant painter, who had been on the
jag in town. His sad end made good copy for
local papers, until there arrived an indignant
letter, in which the painter denied that he was
dead and disclaimed any intention of being so.

The mixture of races in the Northern Ter-
ritory is indicated in the latest report of Abo-
rigines Protector Stretton, of Port Darwin. He
says that last year aboriginal half-castes to the
number of 112 (54 boys and 58 girls) were born,
the fathers being variously European, Chinese,
Malay, Cingalese, Eilipino and French Creole.
Of 100 aboriginal women examined by the Chief
Medical Officer near the settlements only one
was free from trace of venereal disease.
“Derwent” : Be ancient Australian-built
vessels, l’he Royal William is easily first among
those that are left. Built at Hobart in 1833, for
years it carried the mails to Maoriland. It was
something in the way of being a clipper then ;
but now it is only a timber-barge, running from
the Channel to Hobart. Still the Royal Bill isn’t
finished yet, and, afler being blown on the rocks
the other day is being patched for service- again.

“ Riverina ” : Dave turned up at the
“ old people’s ” the other day—just drifted in in
his casual bushman way. He left his home near
Finley (N.S.W.) to bring in some station supplies
from Deniliquin, 30 odd miles away. Arriving in
“ Denny,” he failed to agree about the price of
carting, so instead of going back home he took a
load on to Hay. There a squatter from Wil-
oannia way bought his team and waggon, and
Dave took them out to the station. Then he
“ worked across ” into Queensland, occasionally
buying, and afterwards selling teams and wag-
gons, till at last, four years after leaving home
—lor a few days’ trip—he found himself in
North Queensland with his latest sale cheque in
his pocket. Then Dave suddenly felt like a run
home, and that’s how he came to drift in at the
old people’s place.
BOTH DUFFERS.
THE JACKEROO: “Ye know, Fm an awful duffer

about me, boss. Straight, I couldn't swear to
yer now that these cattle Eve got here is me

“Derelict”: Be “Vigilans”’ par. on
Melville Island prospects (B. 14/7/’10). Nice
chance any company has of canning buffaloes
there. The animals are scattered over 4000
square miles of country, and I’d like to seethe
shooters, who remain in the same camp for no
longer than a week at a time, attempting to cart
the carcases five or ten miles through the swamps
and scrubs to a canning shop. Only an English
company would attempt it.
DAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As I was riding from Quigley Town
One afternoon, in a study brown,
I overtook, at a watercourse,
An ancient man on an ancient horse.
The anoient man was a cheery soul,
With humor dry and with manner droll.
We talked of cattle, their brands and breed
And then the talk turned on his steed.
“ He hasn’t a first-class pedigree,
And he’s not as young as be used to be ;
But, in spite of all, this same old Dan
Has a record proud," said the ancient man.
“He looks,” I said, “ prepared to die.”
“Not he," the old man made reply.
“Old Dan won’t die ; he knows better far—
Why, he’s a prize in the Church Baz tar.
“A wreck? Not he. If he’s not quite new
Old Dan is known to be game right through ;
And though he has only half a lung,
He’s well respected by old and young.
“ Leave Dan out? No ! It would break his heart
If in the Show he should have no part.
In next Bazaar, sir, his name appears—
He hasn’t missed one for fourteen years.”
“But how,” I asked, “can this thing be?
He must sometimes be won by somebody.”
The old man patted his ancient hack—
“ The winner, sir, always gi ves him back.”
“Such service long merits rich reward.
What can the Church to Dan afford?”
The old man whispered—“ His worth is ptized.
I expect old Dan will be canonised.”
CREESE ROE.
THE RIDDLE BOVINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Do cows think ?—Daily payer.
Why should a daily paper set
Such riddles on its lofty page
While yet the print with blood is wet
That tells me how the heathen rage?
It asks—the fact I dare not blink—
If cows can think, if cows can t hink.
Speak not to me of fistic wars,
Distract me not with love or wine.
Hence, hence ye seas and suns and stars,
Avaunt, ye horses, sheep and swine ;
Before this problem all things sink,
I want to know if cows can think.
Let who will shout for Labor’s cause,
Let who will navigate the air,
Let who will win the world’s applause,
Or play with Susan’s tangled hair,
I won’t go mad, or take to drink,
Till I find out if cows can think.
I will not give the problem o’er,
I’ll hang to it like grim despair.
Though bulls of Bashan round me roar,
And milking herds about me stare,
My heavy task I will not shrink
Till I’m persuaded cows can think.
This great conundrum of our time
Is weighty as a zealot’s vow,
In haunts my soul in prose and rhyme—
Get hence ! Get hence ! O blessed cow !
Yet tell me e’er the dawn grow pink,
O cream-constructor, can you think ?

The atrocious lie of “ I. Way man ” :
It is amusing to hear the drawing-room critics, here-
abouts, decrying local football methodsasbeing “ rough,”
“ brutal,” etc. They don’t know what rough play is. In
the early 'eighties I was in Vera Cruz, Mexico, and wit-
nessed much of that class of battailous sport. They
played the game there. In big matches the selectors
had an army of emergencies, and hordes of referees
were indispensable for the completion of a game.
The visitor’s gasp of astonishment at the weighty en-
trance fee subsided when he beheld the squad of sur-
geons and half-hundred stretcher-bearers that were re-
quisitioned at each match. The referee’s first shrill blast
was the signal for hefty valor to run riotous. They played
the game in those days ! The dead were thrown clear of
the line. Emergencies took their places, and the battle pro-
ceeded. While the surgeons and attendants were sweat-
ing at high pressure the notice board bespoke such items
as these : “No. 13, general concussion No. 27, leg
torn off”; “No. 41, head missing”; “7th, or 9th, or
14th referee in command,” and so on. Mifior accidents
were not recorded.
I witnessed a splendid conflict one season between
a team of Spanish half-breeds from town and
the ranch boys. Before a draw was declared, 17
referees and 291 humans, or inhumans, were used up.
About midway in the game (that nonsensical half time
rest was unknown in those days) someone had noticed
that the ball had disappeared. “ Never mind the ball,
boys,” cried the referee (I think he was the 9th). “It is
quite unnecessary. On with the game.” These were the
last words he ever uttered. Even as he spoke he was
rent asunder. The gap he caused was speedily filled,
and the conflict surged with unabated vigor through-
out the afternoon. Towards sunset the last referee
received a mortal injury. With his dying breath
he declared the game a draw. But the sport
was too strenuous. It was not long before the
supply of scrum material failed to meet the demand.
Innumerable mansions of retired sawbones and obituary
merchants dot the countryscape, but the vali nt scrim-
mager is not. A few ancient scrum-scarred derelicts still
roam around the ranches and prate of bygone glories, but
the present generation plays croquet. Let me hear no
more of this chatter about rough play.
A TRIFLE CONTRADICTORY.
ARRESTING COP : “I found the defendant, yer
Worship, speechless drunk, usin’ obscene language.”
“ Echo ” : “ Shakebite ” says (B. 14/7/’10)
that “the Gippsland record for paling splitting,
two men, one billeting all the time, is 1200.” He
evidently never heard of the contest between
Roberts and Arthur for a wager of £2O. The
conditions were simply the greatest number of
marketable 6ft. palings in eight hours; time was
allowed off for meals and smoko. Picked billets
were provided. Roberts turned out 3363, only
five of which were rejected. Arthur, whose arm
at the finish looked as if it had had a willing go
with a coil of barbed wire gone mad, knocked up
3760, but 900 of these were declared rejects. On
another point raised by “ Snakebite ” : I know a
tree that yielded 9000 6fts. and 1100 sfts. Prices
for splitting about here (South Gippsland) run at
ss. 6d. for 6fts. and 4s. for sfts.
“Machete ” :
Anent those pig-
mies, said to have
been discovered
in Dutch Papua.
One of the oldest
and best-known
ex-black birdersin
the country told
me that once he
was handed over
a pigmy at one
of the Queens-
land ports, with
instructions to
land himonAoab,
in the New Heb-
rides. Pyg was
about 4|ft. high,
well - proportion-
ed, and a jolly,
likeable little cus-
tomer. During
his term in
Queensland he
had accumulated
a lot of chattels.
When the schoon-
er arrived at
Aoba, there were
a lot of others to
go off. These had
previously told
my informant
that Pyg was one
of a tribe of
little folk who
lived on a high
pyramidal moun-
tain, and de-
scended to rob
gardens, etc., in
the coastal vil-
lages. The pig-
mies were not
popular with the
larger dwellers on
Aoba. Many and
persistent were
the efforts to in-
duce the skipper
to land Pyg with
the others, at
various coastal
villages, and leave
him among his
enemies, and
finally an attempt
was made to buy
him. Pyg was
landed by two
boats’ crews at a
spot selected by himself, and, as the place was a
safe one, the party camped ashore. Pyg dived into
the forest—it was just sundown —and disappeared.
Before dawn he returned with a band of small
friends and relations. They gathered up Pyg’s
belongings, and, with many boxes and bundles
slung on poles, the rich man of Pygmytown and
his following headed for home.
Byron (N.S.W.) Shire Council has a sani-
tary inspector, stationed at Bangalow, and his
reports add to the gaiety of nations. The other
day he sent this along to his august bosses :
Since my last report I had a dog buried at a cost of half
a crown. He was only a pup, and not quite so dead as
the one that cost 10s. On Thursday last the fact that a
dead horse lay on the road near Mr. Wood’s residence
was reported to me. The Shire Clerk authorised me to
instruct maintenance man Clarke to attend to the
obsequies. I have ascertained that the horse was sold by
Fletcher to Graham, but not fully paid up, so there is
some doubt as to the liability. But no wise man ever
owned a dead horse.

You may sometimes snatch a spark of
humor even from the columns of a weekly de-
signed essentially for home consumption. This
appeared in the Australasian (2/7/TO)
From “Sarah Johnson” (Trafalgar).—“Dear ‘Pa-
tience’ —I must tell you about my trip to Walhalla, as
farm life is so monotonous. It is cow ! cow! cow! from
early dawn to dewy eve. Ido wish father would go to a
warm place where there are no cows.”
This craving for father to go to a warm place is
painful.
A GOOD SIGN.

“ Mularula ” : The Farmers and Settlers’
Association represents the producers. There’s
no doubt of it. I proved it myself a few weeks
back by attending a meeting of a certain north-
western (N.S.W.) branch of that body. Twelve
members were present. A large farmer was in
the chair—so large as to be almost a squatter.
However, we can let him pass. The secretary
was a local auctioneer. The treasurer was a local
produce merchant. There were also present two
publicans, one newspaper proprietor, one con-
tractor, one fruiterer, two sawmill proprietors
and TWO more farmers. The business concerned
mainly the areas of farms recently made available
for selection, and a resolution was carried that
all future selections should have an area of not
less than 2560 acres. Oh, yes ! the F. and S. A.
represents the farmers all right. My Oath !! !

In the early days of Auckland (M.L.)
some lone and brambly lunatic from the Fog
Country imported certain blackberry plants in
order to give his garden a home-like appearance.
The blackberry, finding the climate and soil
agreeable, took three gigantic bounds and was all
over Maoriland. Now it is one of the worst pests
in the rocking islands, and has overrun many thou-
sand acres of valuable land. A genius or another
madman has now arisen in Masterton to declare
that he has discovered a convolvulus vine that is
capable of killing the blackberry root and branch.
Already many wild farmers are shouting to the
Government for tons of convolvulus. That is a
beautiful way the acclimatisation people have.
They first recklessly import sparrows, and
then, when the sparrows become a curse,
they clamor for a consignment of lions
to eat the sparrows. Or else they bring in the
water-hyacinth, and when it chokes up the rivers
someone suddenly discovers that there is a special
kind of crocodile which tramples on hyacinth ;
and he and his friends won’t vote for the Govern-
ment any longer unless they get much crocodile
by return post. It is probable that there is some
point in the collection of foreign nuisances, when
there will be only one thing to be done— i,e., to
import every animal and vegetable on earth that
isn’t already imported, and leave them in a hope-
ful spirit to fight it out. Then this advertisement
will appear in all the papers of the earth :

“ Pick ” : I want to hear from the liar or
brigand or other scoundrel who can better two
instances of long distance swimming by dry land
animals that have come under my notice. During
the 1891 flood in the Murrumbidgee a bullock was
washed off Roberts Island, near Gundagai, and
was afterwards found alive and well on Burra-
bogie station—2oo miles or thereabouts further
along the trickle. When the steamboat; Bega
tipped up off Outtagee some time ago, it had a
cargo of pigs aboard. They were spilt into the
ocean at about 10 o’clock p.m. At four o’clock
the following afternoon the steamer Coomoonderry,
proceeding to Bermagui to pick up the ship-
wrecked passengers and crew, passed one of the
pigs near Montague Island, and it was still swim-
ming strongly.
ONE OF THE BOYS TELLS A GOOD YARN
LAST THING BEFORE BREAKING UP.
“ Phil Harum ” : I don’t know what truth
lay in the recent revelations made by Holman,
M.L. A., concerning the rabbit trade ; but he
could have added a final paragraph to his chapter
of horrors had he witnessed the way in which the
defunct bunny is conveyed from his native pas-
tures to the nearest railway station. Vehicles of
all kinds are pressed into the service, and rabbit
carcases are hung in every available place around,
above and below the cart or sulky or waggonette,
as the case may be. There is no protection from
the elements. In dry weather the carcase^,are
open to the flies and dust, and in wet they are
splashed with mud from every puddle on the
road. I’ve seen bunny travelling in his hearse,
and that’s where he and I part company.
THE EX-BOOZER’S LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I remember, I remember in the younger years of mine,
When the days were days of hurry, and the nights were
nights of wine,
I could stand beside the swiftest when the glasses used
to clink,
I had quite a reputation for the drinks I used to drink.
But the old man Time’s been busy ; he is straddled on my
hack,
And from being once a scorcher I am nothing but a hack ;
When the team is on the racket from the pub I have to
slink,
For my thirst goes out of action when it’s time to drink
the drink.
Oh, the thirst I fed and nourished in the olden, golden
years,
You have left me dry and lonely, you have driven me to
tears—
You were such a noble doer, such a persevering sink —
Fancy you to be a quitter when the world is full of drink !
I shall never march my thirst in—lay it proudly on the
bar,
I have done with pots and pewters—l but view them
from afar—
And my heart is cold with sorrow where I sit and think
and think,
Making out a mental tally of the drinks I’d like to drink.

A MISSING MATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jack Duggan, platelayer, last beard of 13 years ago.
Very old friend would like to hear of him. Write to
M.S., 184 York-street, Subiaco, W.A. —“ Missing Friends”
Advt. Melbourne Age.
Anyone heard of Jack Duggan, mate in the years that
are gone ;
Days of the graftin’ and sluggin’ when Groperland’s
treasures were won !
Heard of that platelaying party?—Jack that I knew in
the West ;
Cheerful and pagan and hearty, one of the whitest and
best 1
A strong man was he and a smiter, wielding the hammer
and drill;
Crossed with a streak of the fighter—“ scrapped ” with a
pile-driving will !
Never went seeking a riot, there when you needed him
bad ;
Find him, and whisper it quiet— Ask him to answer the
Ad. !
Camp-fires are scattered in ashes, years take their
hastening way ;
Memory comes with its flashes —Jack ! is he living to-day ?
Things I recall and remember, suffering arid profit and
loss;
Clare of a blinding December, punching the road to the
’Cross!
Sand and the flies and the fever, Jack nursing six in their
tents ;
Spending his uttermost stiver, master of days and events!
Raised us again to the living, buried and prayed for the
dead;
Took no account of the giving—“ Take it and d—n you ! ”
he said.
Swore like an angel from Heaven, tending and fixing the
sick ;
Sinners who parted unshriven, leaving the shovel and
piek;
Bones that are perished and nameless, taking their rest
in the sand ;
Souls that are vanished and fameless —these knew the
touch of bis hand !
Fought them in days of their vigor, helped them in times
of despair;
Nursed them in hours of Death’s rigor, muttered their
burial-prayer!
These are the tilings I remember, such are the deeds I
recall—
Days when ’mid glare of December faces were turned to
the wall!
Makers of nations and cities, builders of splendor and
pride;
Hearts where-the faith and the grit is—men who have
labored and died!
Platelayers, gangers and toilers, building the Permanent
Way; " .
Lines where the loco.’s big boilers drive their expresses
to-day !
Engines and drivers and tenders, stokers and water and
coal;
Bagmen and agents and vendors—these through the
mulga-land roll!
No one aware of the labor —slaves of the sand and the
sweat;
Sounding the Commonwealth’s tabor—sounding it royally
yet!
Anyone heard of Jack Duggan I—he's vanished and
great is our loss.
Last saw him graftin’ and pluggin', drivin’ the road to
the ’Cross 1
Pagan and cheerful and hearty, Jack that I knew in the
West;
Heard of that platelaying party I—one of the ivhitest and
best ! ,
Heard of the toilers and smiters i Heard of the stalwart
and strong ?
Poets and singers and 'writers, give them a cheer and a
■ song!
Give them a cheer for the old days—Jack ~t We are
wanting him bad ;
Knew him way back in the gold days ; ask him to answer
the ad. !
VICTORIA.

It is really remarkable
that no one seems to have been struck by the fact
that, in spite of the regular daily cleansing with
tooth-soaps and pastes, the teeth, and particularly
the back teeth, frequently become decayed and
hollow. Is not that a convincing proof that
tooth-soaps and tooth-pastes are entirely inade-
quate for the purpose? Our teeth are not so
obliging as to decay only in places where we can
conveniently reach them
with the tooth-brush.
On the contrary, it
is just in those
localities which
are difficult of
access, such as
the backs of the
molar teeth, the
interstices be-
tween the teeth,
hollows and cracks,
that the decay and
destruction of the teeth
appear most frequently, and
gh
are most likely to occur. In consequence, if
anyone wishes to preserve his teeth intact —that
is to say, to keep them healthy—this can be
effected in one way only—by daily cleansing and
rinsing the mouth and teeth with the antiseptic
dentifrice Odol. During the process of rinsing,
this preparation penetrates everywhere, reaching
alike the hollows in the teeth, the interstices
between them, and the backs of the molars. Odol
destroys the microbes and arrests all bacterial and
fermentation processes which attack the teeth.
PERSONAL
ITEMS
Said the S. M. Herald, disloyally
(30/7/T0)
At no place is the late King so much missed as at race-
meetings.
The cynical irony of it! Ed. VII., “the great-
est constitutional monarch the world has
known,” “ the peacemaker of Europe,” the sove-
reign whose death “ threw the whole earth into
mourning,” is grieved for most bitterly, not in the
great chancelleries, not amongst statesmen or
thinkers or churchmen, but in those dubious
resorts where loud-voiced aliens howl the odds,
and “ramps” are worked and favorites “stif-
fened” and punters “ welshed ” —in the haunts, in
short, which the social purists claim should be
wiped off the face of a scandalised earth.
A GREAT TEMPTATION.
FLOST : “ Yes, I’ve had this whisky for 10 years.”
GUEST: “Good Heavens, old man! You must
possess phenomenal powers of self-control.”
Hughes, the Federal Attorney-General,
did not begin to study law until after he had
entered Parliament; and neither did Denny, the
S.A. Attorney-General. Still those two were
fairly rapid. There are two others who haven’t
started to study it even yet.
Adelaide Register has just farewelled
three of its staff. W. T. Bednall, who has been
on the paper 57 years, retires to rest. E. J.
Stacy, after 22 years, is following precedent in
the office and going into the church. Adelaide
has, taking them all round, the most pious set of
pressmen to be found anywhere. The biggest
gap is made by C. J. Stevens, associate editor.
He has had 35 years of it, and retires to a
farm by medical orders. Also, D. J. Gordon,
chief of staff, went out recently to contest a seat
in the Federal Senate, and then started as an
agent in the city ; and Robert Kyffin Thomas,
business manager and one of the proprietors, has
just died. Promotion has been brisk on the
Register this year.
Rockefeller, saith the cable, is now only
kept alive by daily baths in neat whisky :
And reading’ this much not a few
Are willing to allow
That certainly they never knew
The curse of drink till now.
“ Londoner ’ : Thus one of our weeklies
recently
Since the funeral of King Edward the Royal Standard
has continued to float over Buckingham Palace —to King
George’s dismay. ... It positively distresses him to see
the Royal Standard still flying over his widowed mother’s
residence. There can be but one Sovereign of Great
Britain, and, therefore, there can only be one dwelling-
place distinguished by his personal flag-. Just now the
King’s Court is at Marlborough House. It is contrary to
the whole signifi-
cation of flags that
two Standards
sh ould be displayed
—the one at Marl-
borough House
and the other at
Buckingham Pal-
ace... Queen Alex-
andra has given defi-
nite orders that the
Royal Standard should
continue to fly over ihe
roof that sheltered her.
In vain her son repre-
sented that it was a
meaningless symbol un-
der the changed circum-
stances. And, when ar-
gument failed, equally in
vain did he use his influ-
ence. Queen Alexandra-
backed up, it is said, by
her sister, the Empress
Marie of Russia—is as adam-
ant.
In short, the widowed queen
has not only jumped her son’s palace,
so to speak, but has assumed his
flag. The trouble, according to those
who should know, arises from the
unquenchable passion for the lime-
light which obsesses ex-Queen Alex-
andra, as it does all who have ever
worn a crown. It is jealousy pure and
simple. Thus the German Emperor is
known to be jealous of the Crown Prince,
and visits his wrath on that inoffensive
young man on the lightest pretext. Under
present circumstances the German Crown Prince’s
relations with his male progenitor are just about
as strained as were those of his ancestor, Frederick
the Great, with his predecessor.
Mrs. G, A. Murray, who died at Manly
(N.S.W.) a few days ago, was the widow of a
former partner of P. N. Russell, the rich bene-
factor of Sydney University. She was a grand-
daughter of Colonel Johnstone, of the Rum-selling
Corps, who deposed Governor Bligh in 1808, and
thus raised about the biggest shindy the Ma State
has to its credit.
“ Vic.” gives an old chemist a send-off: —
Grimwade has died. Not much of a Legislative Coun-
cillor, but first-rate as a business man. He was a whole-
sale chemist, a partner of the late Felton, and in the
matter of lucre will pan out as well. As a druggy
pioneer he had a great “ slant ” in 1866, when he acquired
the business of Youngman, an enterprising fellow, who
was lost in the London. Enormous profits were raked in
at times, when certain lines were scarce and Freetrade
prevented the establishment of local factories. He was
keen, too. One of his enterprises was the getting of
leeches from Echuca-—a million at 10s. per 1000. Abo-
rigines caught them on their legs. These leeches fetched
30s. per 100 in England. The bushman’s demand for
painkiller helped on his fortune ; he used to import
£30,000 worth of it per year. But the drug biz must
have fallen off in later years, when doctors no longer give
a patient physic by the bucketful, as if he were a sick
elephant.
Prime Minister Andrew Fisher will take
part in the inauguration of the S’African Union.
S’Africa has already met a few Australian
politicians. Foremost there was Fisher’s pre-
decessor, J. C. Watson, who put in
many months in search of desirable
dredging areas, apparently with no
luck. In 1904, High Court Justice
R. E. O’Connor, railed from Dur-
ban to Capetown, via Johannes-
burg, Pretoria and Bloemfontein.
Dick Sleath was on hand during
the war, and Nick Willis sheltered
there during another disturbance.
But the Australasian who kicked
up most dust was Digger Dick Sed-
don. Kitchener found him quite as
irrepressible as the Boers. The press
censors blue-pencilled his speeches
rigorously; but his teeming cable-
grams, at the Cape Government’s ex-
pense, got through. It didn’t matter
to strategy what circulated in Maori-
land. But that cable bill amazed the
Cape Parliament, and provoked excited criticism
and violent sarcasm.
Foster Fraser’s degenerate Australian
may be glad to learn that one of him, Frank
Lush, a graduate of the Ballarat School of Mines,
has been chosen to erect tin-sluicing machinery
at New Quay Moors, Cornwall, to work a 3200-
acre property. Most of the plant is to be pro-
cured from Australia, and Australian methods of
tin-winning are to be adopted.
Died recently at Braidwood (N.S.W.),
W. E. Royds, who missed owning a Melbourne
Cup winner by £950. Bravo was the animal.
Royds bought it for £5O, and had hardly sold it
for £lOOO when the ungrateful brute won the
Cup. Later on, Royds had another chance of
winning the trophy with Cobham, but just when
it looked all over bar shouting champagne, the
beast fell, and before it could get up again the
next race was about due. Tricolor, another noble
steed from Royds’ stable, won the Sydney Cup.
but that didn’t satisfy Royds’ ambition; and
now it is unlikely that he’ll ever satisfy it. In
fact, it’s almost certain that he won’t.
Mr. William Maddock, Sydney’s most
ancient bookseller, went out of harness last week.
He it was who in the early ’6o’s established the
business which first was George Robertson’s Syd-
nej T branch, then “Maddock’s,” and finally
“Dvmock’s.” Before coming to Sydney he had
been managing George Robertson’s Melbourne
business ; so his connection with the Australian
book trade runs back for close upon 60 years.
ON THE SCENT.
FRIEND (hurriedly): “ Good
Heavens, Brown, what’s amiss
with you?”
BROWN: “ Someone's stolen my motor, and I’ve
just picked up the trail.”
There passed over at Bendigo (Vic.) lately
Thos. Arundel, aged 86, whose life history was in
many ways typical of the city itself. In the
’so’s he and four others started the Golden
Square Foundry as a co-operative concern, one of
the first employees being Abraham Harkness. By-
and-bve Harkness bought the business, while
Arundel, and afterwards his son and grandson,
became employees. There is no moral about this;
the moral lies in the fact that the very day that
Arundel died Harkness's sons closed the foundry
for good. The centralisation policy of the Vic-
torian railways had been too much for it.
Chas. Brown Kellow, the Melbourne motor-
car importer, is being harassed by the Cus-
toms Department re alleged irregularities ex-
tending over five years. “Charlie” Kellow
came into prominence in the halcyon days of the
League of Wheelmen, and was interested in the
spec, which blossomed as the Summer Nights
Amusements, Ltd. He was the most popular of
the track heroes of his day—the day of Zimmer-
man, Don Walker, and other forgotten pedallers.
But he dropped out when he saw the motor rush
coming, and, getting into the new game quickly,
built up a big business.
Now that “ Gentle Mary ” is jaunting in
foreign parts, the Melbourne clubmen chuckle
over a little story which indicates a disloyal com-
parison of notes re the absentee. It seems that
she did protest too much innocence of the
methods of private-room patrons at a certain
restaurant. When she arrived with her cavalier
at the upstairs landing and he rang the bell, she
would invariably ask, in a tone of artless wonder-
ment: “Do you have to ring a bell?” Even
though it was her second visit dn the one day,
she would be sweetly surprised when her com-
panion touched the tinkler that summoned the
discreet attendant.

Newspaper references to points of likeness
between Peter Bowling’s trial in Sydney and Dan
O’Connell’s in Dublin recall that one of the four
Judges who presided at the O’Connell trial was
uncle of Sydney’s Judge Burton, who had so much
to do with early Australia’s law and politics.
Uncle Burton was an English lawyer who had
secured a seat on the King's Bench, Dublin, and
to him fell the job of passing sentence. Though
passions were fierce in those days, Uncle’s heart
remained soft, and he had wept into several hand-
kerchiefs before he reached the end of his decree.
Nephew Burton retired from Sydney Supreme
Court in that same year, being informed that he
was likely to be appointed Chief Justice of Madras
at a salary of £6OOO a year. But the cup slipped;
and, though he stayed in India a while, he re-
turned to Sydney to die. While on the Australian
Bench he passed about twice as many death sen-
tences as any other Judge; and he didn’t weep,
either.
Some of “ W.B.M.’s ” impressions of W.
H. Kelly, M.H.R.
Willie Kelly, called “Motor-car” Kelly because be
was one of the first to petrol in Sydney, is not half
as objectionable as he appears on the surface of
the morning paper. The worst thing about him is that
he is in the Australian Parliament. But he cannot be
held entirely responsible for that. When the Political
Labor League Executive selected Arthur Vernon to
oppose him —quiet; decent, inoffensive old fellow—Willie
was as good as elected. The other day Arthur Vernon
submitted himself to the Labor League of Woollahra
State electorate (within Wentworth Federal elec-
torate), and received just one vote! In the cir-
cumstances, Willie Kelly couldn’t well help getting
back to the Federal Parliament. Still, this much may be
said in his favor : he is an Australian, who sticks to Aus-
tralia when he might take himself and his income to
London or “the Continent.” Also he fights for a Federal
Parliamentary career, which is a commendable exercise,
anyhow. It is true that he has made many bloomers,
but they have been amusing, as when he telegraphed to
Fisher to call Parliament together and present a Dread-
nought to Britain to scare off Germany. As Government
Whip he applied the gag, and, in supervising the packing
of his hosiery to catch a train, he mis.-ed an important
division. He is getting more genial, and his tact-
lessness is not so apparent. He interjects rarely now,
and is seldom on his feet. If he goes on like this, much
will be forgiven and forgotten, and members may suspect
that there is something in him that may come out. of him
in a decade or two, when his oiled hair is grey and dry.
First we read this :
London, July 22.—The Prime Minister is being ques-
tioned daily in the House of Commons regarding Field-
Marshal Lord Kitchener’s being left on the unemployed,
list.
And then we got this :
To the Editor, Tub Bulletin, Sydney.
Sir,—Will you kindly insert the following advt. in your
widely-circulated paper, and oblige,
Yours, etc., Kitchener.
SITUATION WANTED.
To Nations, J. C. Williamson and others. Reliable,
experienced man seeks position as boundary-rider or
generally useful. Mustering a specialty ; but class of
work, hours, bill of fare or climate immaterial. Would
accept engagement with theatrical company travelling
Northern Territory, having played leading parts in mili-
tary drama for many years. Best of references and press
notices. Apply “ Kitch,” this office.
“ Ceph ” : According to Modern Society,
(2/7/TO) Kaiser Bill is going mad. The London
sheet tones the unpleasant news down somewhat,
but there is no getting away from the meaning
of it. Some extracts :
Needless to say, the outside world has not been
allowed to learn anything of the real nature of the recent
ill-health of the German Emperor, and probably it never
will. For many years past the strictest secrecy has been
enjoined in Germany respecting the health of the various
members of the Royal Family, and especiallj - that of the
Kaiser. The Court physicians are changed with be-
wildering frequency, and of late the Emperor has grown
more capricious than ever in this direction There
has never been a harder worker than Wilhelm 11.., nor
one who has devoted himself more completely to the
task in front of him. He has never spared himself, any
more than he has spared those in his immediate entour-
age. And the strenuous life he has led since he succeeded
his late father is at length finding him out. - - - h The
breakdown is more complete than is officially admitted,
and both his family and his physicians are urging upon
him the imperative necessity that exists for him totnke a
long and complete rest from all State cares and worries....
His temper has been petulant and irritable for
several years past, and he has been known to turn vio-
lently upon those for whom he has expressed unalterable
affection only a few hours previously. . To-day, this
uncertainty of temper is more pronounced than formerly,
and added to it are fits of depression, some of which last
for a considerable period. When these fits are upon him
he will move about his palace moodily, and without the
least attention to what is passing around him. He will
brush past members of his own family without theslight-
est recognition : while, if he speaks at all, it is only to
reprove some fault or shortcoming—real or imagined—or
to grumble because something is not quite to his liking.
He will glance through a document of the gravest im-
portance when suffering from this depression, and then,
with an angry gesture, tear it into shreds, and bid
another document of entirely different tenor to be pre-
pared and laid before It is not too much to say
that, unless some cure for the physical and mental ills
which are affecting the Emperor just now can be speedily
devised, there will be even graver news to chronicle con-
cerning him before very many more months have passed.
MY OATH!!
THE KING READS ABOUT DILL MACKY.
G. Bernard Shaw, in an article on “ The
General Mourning,” in the New Age, describes
the popular impression of King Edward VII.—
the idea of majesty that appealed to John Bul-
lock’s heart: ‘’The jovial figure with field-glasses
on a racecourse, or with a cigar between his lips
on the deck of a yacht, a model to all stock-
brokers from Friday to Tuesday. .. . The
public liking was founded on those obvious
qualities of his which would have made him an
admirable sporting publican.”
BALLADE OF THE BUSTED UNDERTAKER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His undertaking business fell off, as the town was such
a healthy place. He only got two funerals the last six
months, instead of two a week. He was losing every week
through having to keep funeral horses. He started
undertaking five years ago, hut he could not say that the
business ever paid. There was another undertaker in the
town. He kept two large black horses.— Extract from
undertaker’s evidence in Bankruptcy Court.
The Oldest Resident totters by;
The black horse stamps in his stall all day ;
Out from the coffins there floats a sigh :
“ When is he going to pass away?
Axle-grease, blacking, chaff, oats and hay !
Ev’ryone gets in a hill on me !
Hearken, old man, to my doleful lay :
A hearse and pair to Eternity ! ”
I see no cloud in the summer sky ;
I scent no storm that will chill and slay ;
No city dangers through these streets fly ;
Unharmed and happy the children play ;
The tough old veteran just goes grey,
And slyly chuckles in senile glee,
As, under my breath, he hears me say :
“A hearse and pair to Eternity 1 ”
Why do the people refuse to die ?
Listen ! the funeral horses neigh !
The price of fodder is very high ;
The likely “ jobs ” are alive and ga.v ;
Spade, nails and hammer no longer pay
The sexton hursts ere he earns a fee
For Life puffs on at his ancient clay :
“A hearse and pair to Eternity I”
envoy.
Brothers and Sisters, if you will stay,
The lot must go to the assignee !
Die and he done with the madd’ning fray 1
A hearse and pair to Eternity !

'OME LOVERS look for something more than a certain number of rooms
and conveniences in these days —they look for the artistic attractions
interior and exterior —of the properties brought to their notice.
That word " WUNDERLICH ” in the advertisement of a house to let or
for sale quickly catches the eye of the house hunter —not merely because of
the advantages offered by WUNDERLICH Art Metal Ceilings, but because
it is known that when a builder has sufficient foresight to put
WUNDERLICH Ceilings in a house, he adds other modern improvements
and makes the property thoroughly up-to-date in every way.
The hygienic, fire-proof and germ-proof qualities of WUNDERLICH
productions are well known to house hunters to-day, and the decorative
qualities of these AUSTRALIAN MADE Ceilings appeal with ever-increasing
interest to that rapidly growing army of beautiful-home lovers.
Therefore, when you build a house, don't forget to fit it up in a way
that will enable you to put that word ** WUNDERLICH ” in the u To Let **
or u For Sale" Advertisement.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
July was the first month of the States financial
year ;so the Treasury returns don’t signify much. The
revenue figures compared with those of July, 1909, like
this: —
July, 1909. Julv, 1910.
N. S. Wales ..£963,188 £788,192 Dec. £174,996
Victoria .. 627,185 565,415 Dec. 61,770
Queensland .. 359,834 373,988 Inc. 14,154
Westralia .. 153,790 169,021 Inc. 15,231
Tasmania .. 58,389 59,719 Inc. 1,330
The trouble with N.S.W. and Victoria was that the Com-
monwealth didn’t pay over the whole three-fourths of
the net Customs and excise revenue within the month.
Through past pandering and blundering the Common-
wealth is now far more urgently in need of money than
it ought to be. Expenditure has been deferred simply
that the States might be paid millions more than
they were entitled to; and various Federal services
—the telephones, for instance—necessarily had to suffer.
Now there is a call for a large outlay in a lump ; so the
Commonwealth Treasurer was unable to immediately
hand over the entire three-fourths, though the matter
was adjusted no later than the eighth of the current
month (August). There has been the usual amount of
senseless yapping at the Commonwealth ; yet it is no
more bound to hand over the money every month than
it is to hand it over every evening.
Apart from the Commonwealth refunds the
States’ revenue figures continue to show up very well.
In N.S.W. railways earned £46,030 more than in July,
1909 ; in Victoria' £18,169 more ; in Queensland, £23,208
more. But this isn’t net gain ; working expenses have
no doubt increased and interest on new works has to
come out of the balance. On the whole, however —
though the figures for one month don’t mean much —the
aggregate expenditure figures, so far as they are avail-
able, have not jumped seriously, if at all :
July, 19C9. July, 1910.
New South Wales £1,100,935 £1,144,644 Inc. £43,709
Queensland .. 268,459 228,281 Dec. 40,178
Westralia.. .. 210,735 209,951 Dec. 784
Apparently there are a few debts that Queensland hasn’t
paid within the month either. Listening to the savage
remarks of the State-frighters because the Common-
wealth didn’t square up before the 31st, one would sup-
pose that the State Treasuries never let a bill run for
more than a month. Whereat wayback contractors in
particular will smile ; for often they are kept waiting
three and four months, and sometimes more.
Loan expenditure is only mentioned in a whis-
per, and then by but two States. The N.S.W. “ De-
form ” Government, which came in to stop the furious
borrowing of Waddell, and afterwards took Waddell into
the Ministry to show how he did it, spent £201,723 of
Cohen’s money in July ; so it is evidently aiming at
another £2,500,000 or £3,000,000 year. And Queens-
land put its handful of people into pawn for another
£115,308. The others are as silent as death on the
unpleasant subject.

That, however, calls for some explanation. One column
shows the revenue or profit put into works, etc. Hitherto
the expenditure under this head has been for “ extension
and improvement of works and plant,” and was thus
really capitalised profits. But in the account this half-year
the item reads : “ Expenditure for extension and im-
provement of works and plant, and for contingencies
(including balance of extra cost of coal during strike).”
Bow much has gone into new works and how much into
coal at famine prices there is no way of telling. For
that reason the profit alleged to have been earned was
not true profit, because the profit wasn’t profit if the ex-
penditure didn’t include the full price paid for the
coal. As a matter of fact, besides this item, the
directors in the previous half-year wrote off £9500
of alleged profit to part-cover the extra cost of
coal, and in the past half-year they also appropriate
£lO,OOO of what they call profit. In the foregoing table
these two items, being traceable, have been reckoned as
expenditure, and deducted front profit. What isn’t
traceable is how much of the £32,157 should be deducted
in the same way. There is a curious difference in the
methods of the two big Australian gas cos. That of
Sydney obviously struggles all the time to subdue its
declared profits—to make them look as modest as
possible. That of Melbourne, on the contrary, is dis-
posed to inflate its profits. There is no doubt a reason
for it all. Perhaps the Melbourne Co. remembers that
the Citv Council or “ any incorporated public body” has
the right to buy the undertaking “ upon paying to the
co. a sum equal to 18 years’purchase of its net annual
profits, estimated on the average of the three then next
preceding years.” Anyhow, something or other produces
a curious result when the alleged-profit figures of the two
cos. are compared :
Sydney. Melbourne.
June, 1909 .. £54,746 £84,831
Dec., 1909 .. 64,012 76,280
June, 1910 .. 18,081 71,955
It makes out the Sydney co. to be a shockingly bad
manager; and, whatever else it may be, it is scarcely
that.
But they have this in common : they are both
on a remarkably good wicket. Since the 10 per cent,
div. was started in 1905, no less than £182,580 has been
put by the Melbourne co. into plant and works, includ-
ing the few thousands that were used to pay for
the extra-big coal bill of last term; and, on top
of the 10 per cent. div. and this £182,580,
a fair sum has been added to reserves, and a much larger
sum has been written off stocks, etc., while repairs, re-
newals and maintenance have been charged direct to
working exes. On the matter of reserves, chairman
Grice in the course of a long address at the half-yearly
meeting, said that Melbourne Age had told a tarradiddle
when ft asserted that the co. was hiding away large
amounts of profits. All the reserve fund it had, he said,
was a poor little one of £81,382. For a speaker who was
complaining of a paper's alleged distortions and suppres-
sions, this was rather too ingenuous; for Mr. Grice no
doubt knows as well as anybody that a co. may have
huge reserves which it doesn’t show at all—reserves con-,
sisting of works paid for out of profits, and thereupon not
added to the assets shown in the accounts. Here are
some suggestive figures:—
June, 1900. June, 1910.
Book value of works, build-
ings, mains, etc £2,132,240 £2,167,127
Sales of gas, etc. .. . ■ 156,411 279,786
Sales per cent, of book value
per annum £l4 13 6 £25 16 0
All the mains extended and plant added during the past
10 years have thus been paid for by the consumers ; none
whatever has been paid for out of capital. The very
slight addition to the total figures is through land pur-
chases. And what those extensions and additions
amount to is at least suggested by the increase in the
sales of gas, etc. Such extensions and additions are as
much a reserve fund as though they appeared on the
balance-sheet.

This co. managed to get through the coal strike without
showing marks of the unpleasantness on the balance-
sheet ; but how the trick was done the modest directors
don’t say. Altogether for a Brisbane concern it has had
an amazingly good time the last 16 or 18 years. In 1894,
when Queensland was sitting in the gutter trying to
remember what it had been doing overnight, this co.
paid lOpercent.; and subsequently, notwithstanding that
most of Brisbane went to bed at eight o’clock lest some-
body should drop in and ask for the loan of sixpence, the
Gas Co. only got down as low as 9 per cent. Five years
ago, when things began to get good again in the North-
ern State, the co. made shareholders a free gift of
£20,009 worth of shares; so the present 12 per cent, is
really 14 per cent. The financial position is exceptionally
strong: —
June, ’O3. June, ’lO.
Liquid assets.. .. £35,479 £47,263
Liabilities .. .. 3,544 5,086
Surplus .. .. £31,935 £42,177
Thus £10,242 has been added to the surplus of liquid
assets in seven years. But that is not all; for £29,996
has been added to the book value of fixed assets
(plant, etc.). Of course, the new works added may
only counterbalance the value that the old works
have lost through rust and decay; but it isn’t
likely, for something unmentioned is written off profits
against depreciation. Anyway, here are the obvious
facts. In seven years the co. has regularly paid a big
dividend, has added £10,242 net to its liquid assets, and
in some way or other (by extended mains or otherwise)
has brought up the sale of gas, etc., from £19,907 as at
June, 1903, to £28,416 for the past half-year.

At December, 1900, the paid capital was £25,128; the re-
serves at that time were' £22,700. More capital was then
got in, not because it was needed, but because the pro-
fits could pay the 15 per cent. div. on more, and by 1905
the full amount of the authorised £45,000 was paid up.
Once again, however, the directors saw their way to pass
on to shareholders some more money ; wherefore a few
months ago the authorised capital was increased, and
during the past half-year £10,565 of capital and tl.e same
amount of premiums have been got in. On these last
shares the 15 per cent, therefore really means 7£ percent.
But even that isn’t to be sneezed at, considering the
security ; for after the present div. is paid the co. will
have a surplus of liquid assets of £50,297, and that is
apart altogether from the fixed assets (plant, land, build-
ings, etc.). The co.’s position is quite extraordinary. It
began on a very small capital, and was able to get coal
at a cheap rate ; on the other hand, it had to pay
out comparatively little in divs., so that most of its plant,
etc., has been provided out of profits. It may not have
the same prospects of expansion as some others ; but it
has put itself in the position of being probably the most
solid gas co. in Australia. It is in these days somewhat
worried by electrical competition ; but it is meeting that
by reducing its price, which has now got down to 3s. 9d.
per 1000 ft. to ordinary consumers.

No co. came out of the coal strike worse than this one
did. It had very little combustible substance on hand, but,
notwithstanding that, it apparently hoped to muddle
through somehow. The end was mixed streaks of dark-
ness and tallow candles at North Sydney; so the co.
doesn’t show a worse balance-sheet than it deserves. Yet
it pays its usual dividend, drawing on accumulated
profits to do so. The law in N.S.W. is so bad
that a gas co. may use its published accounts to
conceal its thoughts. In this case it isn’t possible to
find out how much is being written off to cover deprecia-
tion. It may be too much (in other words, the co. may
be stuffing away profits) or it may be too little (in which
case the co. is alleging that its profits are greater
than they really are). It doesn’t, however, look like a
•co. that is making things out to be better than they-
are. Few N.S.W. gas cos. are built that way. They
mostly creep as far into the shell as they can, lest they
should attract the eye of the monster Municipal Social-
ism. Still a co. can’t go on stuffing away profits indefi-
nitely. If, for instance, a gas co. stuffs undisclosed profits
into works, then next year those works earn more
profits; so if the profits were too big to mention
previously, they are bigger than ever now and still more
troublesome. And if the extra profits are stuffed away
likewise into works, then the hidden profit prows still
faster, and presently it is too cumbersome to hide. When
that happens, either the bull has to be taken by the
horns and the reserves have to be transferred boldly to
dividend-getting- capital, or new capital is called in, and
by paying a fat dividend upon it straight away, even
though the money may be lying idle, some of the incon-
veniently large profits are got rid of. Things haven’t
yet arrived at the most distressing stage with the North
Shore Co. ; still it has plainly done extremely well. In six
years to December last it had added over £25,000 to its
visible reserves, and it has been paying a large div., not-
withstanding that over £30,000 of the capital has been
but newly got in, and new capital can’t usually be in-
vested to earn 7J or 8 per cent, straight away.

This very successful bank has shared fully in Maoriland’s
rapid recovery from the shock of 20 years ago. It got
down at that time to a 2£ per cent, div., paid in 1891 ;
but it has gone on edging its way up ever since.
Its profits have been extraordinarily good ; wherefore
in the past 10 years it has been able to do these things :
Pay a div. of from 8 to 13 per cent, per annum ; write
£24,516 off premises account; pay for all new premises
and additions ; and add £327,801 to reserves. Of these
reserves, however, £50,000 came from premiums on new
shares issued. Ten years ago the paid capital was
only £250,000; and when another £125,000 was got in
about four years ago, in 50,000 shares of £2 10s., a pre-
mium of £1 per share was collected. Now', the formal
reserve fund having reached the paid capital, a further
£125,000 of capital is being got in, and this time the pre-
mium is £1 ss. per share. On these shares, notwith-
standing this premium, a 12 per cent. dife. will still
be equal to a return of 8 per cent. For some
years the risks in proportion to capital were heavy,
and some shareholders probably had a few un-
pleasant thoughts concerning the £5 liability; for
old and new shares carry that sting in their
tail. While nominally adding to it, the new capital will,
of course, relieve shareholders of some of their risk—for
a time at any rate—for obviously the bank could now
stand a greater slump than was possible before the extra
£187,500 was dropped into its chest.
The National of Maoriland’s business hasn’t
stopped growing yet. Almost every line showed an in-
crease last year:—
1909. 1910.
Notes in circulation .. £247,177 £268,559 Inc. £21,382
Bills in circulation .. 636,005 536,798 Inc. 793

Advances .. .. 3,736,935 3,957,100 Inc. 220,165
Premises, etc. .. .. 76,232 67,715 Dec. 8,517
There is thus 37fc per cent, of the debt to the public
represented by liquid assets. Of advances and non-
liquid assets the book-value is £4,024,815. The capital
and reserves will amount to £977,910 with the new addi-
tions. Thus very nearly one-fourth of the book-value of
the non-liquid assets could disappear, and the credi-
tors of the bank would still have 20s. in the £ waiting
for them. The creditors’ position is, therefore, very
comfortable ; and the shareholders’ £5 liability makes it
still more comfortable. As for the shareholders, they
can’t afford to forget that the assets are almost all in a
country which has been borrowing furiously and will
have todeave off the vicious habit some day ; and when
that happens there is liable to be a pretty serious slump
in values. For that reason, though the reserves are
already fairlyvstrong, the process of further strengthen-
ing them can’t'Safely be neglected. It is much better to
provide a good insurance fund out of profits than have
to pay it up in a lump at a time when payments are
likely to be most uhcomfortable.

The prospectus of a new Manly pub was issued the other
day, and incidentally it was said therein, on authority,
that this co. had carried 1,701,695 passengers in the last
12 months, exclusive of season-ticket holders ; further,
that this was an increase of 50 per cent, on the number
carried five years ago. Manly, after spurting once or
twice, had had a long drowse, until the surfer discovered
it and introduced it to people who hadn’t given it two
thoughts before. This ferry co. was just ready for the
change. There used to be opposition on the line ; but
an amalgamation had been fixed up, and the co. had the
whole trade in its hands. Further, in the days of dis-
tress, assets and capital had been kept to small figures.
Even as late as 1906, therefore, the 10 per cent, dividend
only called for £1250. The balance of the big profits was
stuck into more ferries ; and, as these earned more big
profits, stock-watering soon suggested itself. The old co.
was wiped out, and a new' one with three times the
capital was put in its place ', the ss. shares were paid up
to 15s. out of the accumulated profits. And late last
year another 23,468 shares were issued free, paid to 15s.
Thus the old capital of £29,335 has been made up to
£105,606 out of profits, and the present dividend of 10
per cent, is really a dividend of 36 per cent.
The Profit and Loss account shows “Net profits
for half-year after providing for depreciation, etc.,
£6638.” There is a lot of virtue in “etc.” To
the man behind the scenes, “fete.” covers a
multitude of grins. The table shows a profit of
£13.280; and that is made up this way:—Added
to Public Risk reserve, £lBO6 ; ditto, Renewal reserve,
£2436; Insurance reserve, £2400; P. and L. account,
£6638. Now, it is quite true that some of the amounts
added to some of the reserves are not the best sort of
profit. They may be called for later on. On the other
hand, they are not the only provisions made for wastage,
etc. Six months ago “ Steamers ” stood in the books at
£78,201; the item now is £71,095. There is evidently
some severe writing down there, quite apart from the
renewal fund. Six months ago liquid assets in excess of
liabilities totalled £36,172. Since then £lO,OOO has been
paid towards a new steamer, and still the surplus of
liquid assets is £41,415. Put it this way .' —

Added to surplus of liquid assets .. .. 5,243
Paid for new boat .. 10,000
Paid for new coaling and berthing jetty .. 803
Total £20,886
That is what the half-year produced. The net profit \vas
no doubt something less; for though repairs and mam-
tenance were charged to working expenses, there was
doubtless some general depreciation ; for though a patched
boat is worth more than one with a hole in it, it isn t
worth as much as it was before it needed patching. Cer-
tainlv, there is a caterpillar even in this beautiful-look-
in"- s'aiad, and its name is “ public risk ’’—the caterpillar
that would bite the co. if a bad accident happened
through the fault of any one of the eo.’s servants. The
directors have begun to take that risk seriously, and by
adding £lBO6 have now brought up the wretched little
reserve to £3116.

New life was put into this concern three or four years
back, and the finances began to get more attention than
they had before received. This and the rapid improve-
ment in Queensland’s mind and pocket have had their
effect, and profits have been rushing on at a speed un-
known to the traffic regulations. But still the co. seems
to have a cupboard, and a skeleton that won’t quit
until it has been fed up a bit; at any rate, every
penny of profit in excess of the dividend is
dropping into a hole somewhere. How much more filling
this hole can take isn’t to be told from the accounts ; but
it can’t be bottomless, and a great deal has been tipped
into it already. The capital used to be £75,993, partly in
£1 shares and partly in shares paid to 15s. The £1 shares
were written down to 4s. 6d. and the others to 9d., and
the other 3s. 9d. on this latter lot has gradually been got
in. Yet, though the writing down was done by the hogs-
head and not by the pint, the old brewery was still
alleged to be worth £31,000 in 1905, whereas all it brought
then was £16,250. That, of course, called for more writ-
ing down. New premises were then supplied ; and it was
to pay for these and the equipment of the extended
business that the rest of the capital was called up. The
various items have moved as follows

Assuming that enough is being written off profits before
they are disclosed to cover current bad debts and depre-
ciation, the outlook is very good ; for the skeleton in the
cupboard must be satisfied before long, and then, even if
dividends are not increased, the visible reserves will start
to jump.

This is a Melbourne-Adelaide co. with a property at Port
Pirie, where it takes a small bite out of the Broken Hill
ore and other traffic as it passes through. The profits
are large, but, like Broken Hill, they won’t last for ever,
and some of the dividends must be regarded as return of
capital only. Repairs and maintenance are charged to
profit and loss ; but £3OOO of the reserves is in a renewal
fund ; aiid that may mean that there is more or less
heavy expense ahead. If this renewal reserve is
simply a set-off against depreciation, then the addi-
tions made to it are not true profit, and the
true profit figures are less than those that occur in the
table. The directors are men with a commanding finger
in the Broken Hill pie ; so, while there is any Broken Hill
pie—and it looks safe for some years—and while the same
fingers stay in it, this co. should get custom. The wharf
property carries a mortgage of £10;000, and no effort has
so far been made to get rid of the encumbrance.

The company promoter is busy. In particular
Sydney’s pockets are bulging, and the gentleman with
the sure fortune to sell wants a little of their contents.
Three large-sized cos. were announced on Saturday, and
a fourth knocked and said it was coming on Monday.
Since the recent Henry Jones and Winchcombe-Carson
successes the profit-taker is on the scent. The Jones jam
shares (£1) were worth from 3s. 6d. to 4s. premium
before the scrip was issued ; and the Winchcombe-Carson
wool-broking shares (55.) have been run up to 9s. in six
weeks. In the latter case, however, the professional
profit-taker had a rather cold time, as the bulk of the
shares were passed on to actual or prospective wool and
produce clients, and the mere market operator pnostly
had his cheque returned.

After being talked of for years there is a definite
proposal at last to give the Ocean Beach at Manly
(N.S.W.) an up-to-date pub. The Clarendon (Kilmin-
ster’s) is to be taken over, and, while the beer-pump is
kept going below, entire reconstruction will proceed
above. The capital the new co. wants is £35,000; the
public is asked to put up £32,000 by instalments—the
other £3OOO goes in shares to the engineers of the business,
and a 6 per cent, cash underwriting commission' is also
taken by the little Sydney crowd which has formed itself
into the" Guarantee Trust, Ltd. One point that the eye
might linger on is that, while the capital is alleged to be
only £35,000, the vendor of the present pub premises and
license is to get £12,000 “in perpetual debentures bear-
ing interest at 5* per cent.” This is equivalent to. an issue
of £12,000 cumulative pref. 5* per cent, shares, with the
other shares ranking after them as to both dividend and
capital. If an investment is loaded with pref. capital it
is a good deal franker to say so.

The old proposal to make a big use of mangrove
bark for tanning is put into definite form by a Sydney-
Adelaide syndicate, which has had the matter in
hand for some months, and has now got far enough ahead
to ask the public to come in and help to put up the money
for plant. Mangrove-tanned leather has been on the
market in a small, erratic way for years; but, mostly, it
has masqueraded as something else, because the people
behind the industry were not strong enough to guarantee
regular supplies, or give the virtues of mangrove-
tanning any advt. Men in the trade have known the
worth of it, though ; and the syndicate holds a report
from Charles Vider (Winchcombe, Carson, Ltd.) to the
effect that the mangrove leather was “ always well
tanned, and invariably topped the market.” Concessions
covering some hundreds of miles of coast have been got
from the Queensland Government; so the question of
supplies won’t give the new co. any trouble, and tne cost
should be ridiculously small compared with that of
either wattle or English oak.
* * * *
The Bowron Bros.’ business, referred to in a
recent Bulletin, is now on the market. These people
have been in the Maoriland leather trade as long as the
oldest inhabitant can remember, and it seems that one
of two of the senior partners want at length to be relieved
of some of their worries. The capital of the new co. is
£175,000 in £L shares ; the vendors are to receive £15,000
in 5 per cent, non-cumulative preference shares, £35,000
in ordinary shares, and £30,000 in cash ; and the stock
up to £50,000 is to be taken at valuation. The purchase
price, apart from stock, is thus £BO,OOO ; and for this the
public gets properties and plant worth, according to
valuation, £56,790, leaving the balance of £23,210 to
represent goodwill. The net profits for two years and
two months are declared by responsible auditors to have
been £46,769; and, if that can be kept up, there is an
easy 7 or 8 per cent, dividend ahead, with ample amounts

Professor Richards, in the revised edition of his
celebrated edition of “ Ore Dressing ” 1909, devotes 14
-pages to the Wilfley concentrating table, and, among
other things remarks (p. 1465): —“The first table sold
was installed in the Puzzle Mill, at Breckenridge.
Colorado. Since then over 12,000 have been sold. This
machine has revolutionised ore dressing, and as such is a
phenomenal success. The original form, and forerunner
of all modern shaking tables with longitudinal riffles.. has
been greatly improved.” And further on (p. 1478) remarks:
“One feature of the Wilfley table to which especial
attention should be called is its ability to separate sands
from slimes while making the ordinary concentration
This separation is more complete and thorough than can
be made by any classifier, and should be taken advantage
of in designing mills.” In the extensive additions just
made to the Golden Horseshoe Mine (YV.A.) a large
number of YVilfley Concentrators have been installed

The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society, Limited, as
follows:—“To have completed £1,278,034 of new business
is a really splendid achievement for any office, but for a
comparatively young one (having been established in
1873) the figures are of intense interest, and indicate the
force of the power which the Colonial Mutual has attained
in the insurance world.”*

Re Co-operative Wool and Produce Co.
(Sydney). As mentioned in The Bulletin (14/7/ 10), the co. s
balance-sheet then showed a capital of £22,-92. Recently,
however, on account of the largely increased turnover,
another 17,708 shares were issued at par. T''® co. thus
started the current year with a capital of £40,000.

Finney, Isles and Co., Ltd., of Brisbane, put
another 15,000 shares on the market the other day, at
215., and applications rolled in nearly' two deep for each
share. As the market for the old issue stood at about
245. 6d., it was a soft thing for the underwriters. But
underwriting is the fashion just now; and in this case
certainly the co. couldn’t afford to risk failure.
A. G. Webster and Sons, one of Tasmania’s
most ancient business institutions, have passed their
affairs over to a co. in 100,000 shares, 10,000 of them
reserved. The partners, who first hung out their sign-
board in Hobart in 1831, take no cash out of the flotation.

Brigadier Neild’s old political pal, ex-Senator
Gray, finds that Freetrade and unrestricted competition
isn’t what it was cracked up to be. Having gone ipto
the parcel-carrying industry in Sydney, he has just taken
part in a deal to amalgamate half a dozen competing
concerns, which have been put upon the market with a
capital of £45,000. The disappearance of the competition,
Mr. Gray’s anti-Sosh friends will grieve to learn, is ex-
pected to result in “an infinitely better service,” while
there should be a saving of “at least £6OOO a year ” in
expenses. In fact, a firm of accountants puts the saving
at £lO,OOO. Mr. Gray endorses these sentiments by
becoming chairman of the new co., which proposes
presently to also introduce motor-traction.

Broken Hill South Blocks Co. has disappointed
its enthusiastic backers so far. When 8., M. and Co.
cook it in hand, with almost unlimited capital to draw
on, the people who had been hanging on for years said :
“Just wait till the plant is finished.” The plant was
finished about two years ago, as far as a plant ever is
finished on a complex-ore mine, and still divs. haven’t
arrived. The course of the co. in its present incarnation
has been as follows:
Written
March, Profit. ■ Divs. off. Reserves.
1907 .. £8,033 Nil £3,847 £4,546
1908 .. 29,566 Nil 29,234 4,878
1909 .. 26,031 Nil 18,900 12,0(.19
1910 .. 28,772 Nil 18,772 22,009
The total of £70’393 which has been written,off has been
spent on development and plant. On these items the
co.’s total outlay has been £117,947 ; so these assets stand
now in the books as worth £47,554. Plant alone has cost
about £BO,OOO ; therefore an amount equal to the whole
of the development has been written off out of profits, as
well as about £33,000 off the plant. It isn’t a bad record
considering the co.’s earlier handicaps as to inefficient
plant, etc., and it would mean substantial divs. presently
if the metal markets were kind. Lately, however, they
haven’t been favorable ; so the good plant has been able
to make very 7 little headway. The financial position has
changed in the 12 months as follows ;
Mar., 1909. Mar., 1910. ,
Liabilities ~ ... £2.4,700 £4,667
Liquid assets .. 33,071 26,676
Surplus .. £8,371 £22,009
Thus what ma.v be called the cash position has improved
by £13,638 during the 12 months. That was the outcome
of treating 117,17? tons of ore. Taking the fair net profit
at £12,500, it would mean 2s. Id. per ton on the out-
out ; and as the reserves are estimated at 536,458 tons,
there is approximately £55,000 of profit in sight, which
isn't overwhelming for a mine valued by the market at
£185,000.
No doubt a dozen things may be dug out to ex-
plain w'hy £55,000 doesn’t represent the value of the
mine. For instance: (1) The coal strike, which added
ito last year’s costs ; (2) there is ore in the bottom of the
unine, yet only what te above the bottom workings has
ibeen reckoned in the reserves; (3) there is ore of un-
Iknown dimensions and value in the south end ; (4) the
-zinc-bearing tailings may be worth something some day;
<5) the metal markets will perhaps improve later on.
All these things are true. The trouble is that
when the possible improvements or developments
happen, up jumps the market, although the changes
Suave been allowed for in the present quotations. In
other words, the way of the mining market is, after dis-
counting a bill and taking the cash, to present it for
payment again on the date mentioned. The man who
gets in now takes some risks ; but he very probably will
come out all right, whether he is a speculator or an in-
vestor—whether he wants to make a profit out of the
market or to reap a fair crop of dividends. It is repeated
that, even now, he takes some risks, for as shown above
he discounts an uncertain future. Nevertheless, he may
eome out all right. But the man who waits for things to
boom and then plunges in—well, only one thing can
happen to him.

The Stockton-Borehole Collieries, Ltd., arrived
a year ago to take over the Borehole (Newcastle) mine
from a co. which was formed in 1906, and apparently did
no good with its property 7. The new co. is in 60,000
shares of 10s., on 23,151 of which 4s. is uncalled. The
property was taken over from the old co. at a valuation
of £36,002 ; of the purchase consideration £15,000 was
represented by debentures, still outstanding. The pre-
sent paid capital is thus £25,370, while, including deben-
tures, the liabilities are £22,432. The output for the year
was £9023 ; and this left the co. £5479 on the wrong side.
The property is leasehold, and the royalty charge last
year was £5OO. Against the heavy loss made during the
year has to be set the fact that apparently the develop-
ment work has all been charged up to working expenses;
and the strike couldn’t have improved this co.’s figures
either.

N.S.W. had an unsatisfactory experience with
the steam shovel as an aid to sluicing at Araluen ; but
the Electro-Hydraulic Co. at Carngham (Vic.) has an idea
that it can do better. The circumstances are different,
certainly. The shovel has been called in by the Electro
people, not because the dirt is in the wrong plage, but
because the ground is too tight for the gold there is in
it. There will be a 7-ton push behind the shovel; and
■that will make something fly— either the dirt or the
anachine.

Gulf Creek Copper Mine (N.S.W.), which
lhasn’t been heard of for a while, reports a fine make of 3
per cent, pyritic ore at No. 6 level, and the winze below
the level is also showing a strong body 7 of ore. The
measurement given is 220 ft. in length by 14ft. wide,
■which indicates an extensive lens that should be easy to
smelt.
Wyalong (N.S.W.) feels a little better. At the
Welcome Stranger exceptionally rich stone is coming up
from the 240 ft. level north of the shaft., The last crush-
ing at Cockle Creek gave lOoz. 17dwt. per ton from 24
tons. On the Shamrock line of reef the Erin’s Isle is
attracting notice. Judging by looks, the stone now
being raised from the 330 ft. should give a very good
yield. . But the reef is only Bin. wide. At that one-time
bonanza, Nield’s No. 1, prospecting is still proceeding at
the 900 ft., and in the further search for the lost shoot the
drill is to be put to work.
* * * *
Tolwong (N.S.W.) has engaged H. C. Rockett,
lately metallurgist at Oonah (Tas.), to tackle its tough
ore-treating proposition.
There had been some over-selling in Main
Ridge (N.S.W.), and the buyers took the chance offered
by the first battery return to do a squeeze. There has
been a good deal of cock-a-doodling over the return ; but,
after all, the co. will have to send out a lot more gold to
make a decent show. A couple of hundred tons of 7dwt.
stuff wouldn’t go far even if it were all profit; and it is a
long way from that. The Ridge isn’t a field to pay a pre-
mium to get into just yet; and the basis of one or two
of the floats has been very unsatisfactory.

The Baillieus early in the day transferred their
favors from the Zinc Corporation to the De Bavay pro-
cess, and later on handled the Amalgamated Zinc Co. to
work the business. As part payment they got a three
years’ option on 122,500 shares at par, with the right to
call for them in blocks. They are now lifting 42,500;
and as shares are steady at about 255., there will be jam
on the Baillieus’ bread for the next few months.

Great Boulder (W. A.) is deepening its shaft to
2800 ft. as fast as it can, and has got a diamond drill at
work in the north end of the No. 19 level. Little or no
prospecting outside the main workings has been done in
this part of the mine below 1200 ft., and the off chance of
getting on to something new has induced the co. to give
it another trial. In the midst of an optimistic harangue
at the annual meeting Chairman Doolette glossed over
the want of values in the bottom workings at 2650 ft. with
the assertion that, even if the shoot had snuffed out or
had ducked into the Horseshoe, the Boulder was a mine
of such great magnitude and had such enormous possi-
bilities that the loss of the body would not cause the co.
very much anxiety. He might just as well have said that
a person without breath would not be inconvenienced.
If the chairman knew the critical state of the mine at
2650 ft. he ought to have owned up.
* * * *
Ivanhoe still leads and others follow in the
West. Winzing below 2120 ft. has practically proved the
permanenc3’ and value of the main shoot for at least
150 ft. below that point, and so well and strong has the
lode gone down to this depth that it has every chance of
doing the same thing for hundreds of feet more. The
borehole prospecting, recently started out west-in the
direction of the Ivanhoe Junction lease, has been com-
pleted. From all accounts it found nothing.
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) published its latest
estimate of reserves the other day ; and it was added
that this cable had accompanied the figures to London :
“ This confirms the estimate of tonnage and value of ore
reserves 31st December, 1909, after making reasonable
allowance for some stopes, the grade of which is not up
to my expectations, and for slide zones.” Now put the
two estimates together :
Tons. Gold, oz.
Dec., 1909 .. .. 1,071,638 593,924
June, 1910 .. .. 903,592 466,363
Reduction .. 168,046 127,561
Meantime, however, 149,003 tons have been treated for
53,2380 z. Allow ldwt. per ton for residues, and you get
a total of 60,6880 z. Deduct that from what was alleged
tobe in reserve as at Dec. 31, and you ought to have
533,2360 z. left, whereas, according to the December
return, there is only 466,3630 z. left; so that 66,8730 z.
have fallen through a hole somewhere. This may be a
“reasonable allowance,” but it means, say, £280,000;
and when £286,000 disappears in smoke or hot air it is
time to get serious.
* * * *
Marvel Loch (W. A.) cleaned up the May half-
year with 25,500 tons of 345. ore in sight and a book credit
balance of £3301. For a co. in a small way of business this
wasn’t too bad ; but then the Board spoiled things by
drawing £2488 to pay a sixpenny dividend, and thus left
itself with only a very flimsy provision for the future.
This habit so often spells ruination that the Marvel Loch
can’t plead that it didn’t know the gun was loaded.

Share and bond holders in Peak Hill Goldfield
(W.A.) held a short service of sorrow in London on
June 28. One or two doleful statements about mine
prospects were made by the chairman, and, no one wish-
ing to prolong the agony, the report was silently adopted.
Meetings were afterwards held of those stuck with prior
lien bonds and debentures, and resolutions were passed
sanctioning the postponement of the payment of principal
and interest to the middle of 1913. There was no parti-
cular reason for making it 1913; on present appearances,
it might just as well have been made 2013.

Gwalia Consolidated (W.A.) has taken 8., M.
and Co.’s tip and shut down.. “ The firm” has come at
last to the conclusion that a payable method of treating
the antimonial arsenical gold ores in the mine has yet to
be found, and it is now busy looking for the same. Mean-
time some underground work is being done ; but, as
already remarked on this page, the co. will shortly have
to raise more money and plenty of it, or else give up the
struggle.

Two of Bainbridge. Seymour and Co.’s experts
have lately been sizing up the gold prospects of Pilbarra
(W.A.), and have also been looking at a mueh-talked-
about asbestos find in the same locality. One is about to
return to London to report progress, but the other is
staying behind to consider other shows.

The Tyrconnel and Henry Grattan mines, on
the Hodgkinson (North Queensland), are to be taken on
by a Melbourne co., and Thompson and Co., Castlemaine
(Vic.), have been asked for specifications for a 20-head
battery of 12501 b. stamps, fitted with rock-breakers,
Wilfley tables, and up-to-date cyanide plant, the power
to be furnished by a suction gas-engine. Capital of at
least £30,000 is to be provided by the southern investors
who are financing the venture. Archbold, a member of
a Chewton (Vic.) firm of slag buyers, etc., who recently
went to North Queensland, has cyanide works running at
Kidston and Durham, and is also a large shareholder in
the Welcome battery at Kidston, and is about to add
another five head and double the cyanide plant’s capacity.
He likes some of the large formations in the district. It
looks as though in the near future the address of many
Victorian mining inen will be N.Q. The values obtain-
able from some of the large and locally despised forma-
tions appeal strongly to men from Victoria, where
machinery is being erected to tackle large formations
running as low as 2Jdwt. Why 4dwt. or sdwt. proposi-
tions of similar size should not pay in Bananaland is what
puzzles the Victorian, and he is daily exhibiting an in-
creased desire to go and find out.
* ■ * *
New Brilliant Freehold, Charters Towers, has
its shaft down 110 ft., so the opening of No. 4 level will
not be long delayed. Unfortunately, the shaft is in dis-
turbed dyke country, and the prospects for 221 ft. along
No. 3 are anything but good. There are, however, hopes
for an improvement, because a winze, some distance
ahead, is showing a big make of stone at 81ft. below No.
2 level. Prospecting is also being done in the hanging-
wall section, which proved highly payable in No. 6 and
No. 7 extensions from Mills’ United; and it is also intended
to push out No. 5. The successful workings are at a
vertical depth of between 1500 ft. and 1600 ft. ; but nobody
knows how far the payable stone extends upward. The
East Mexican is anxious to find that out, too ; and, pos-
sibly, the success it has had in prospecting No. 5 on the
main reef has induced the N.B.F. to drive No. 5 on the
hanging-wall reef.
* * * *
Shares in East Mexican, Charters Towers, are
in favor again because the reef in No. 5 level is showing
some good stone ; 35 tons from there gave £2OB, or
£5 18s. lOd. per ton. No. 6 stopes, rising into poorer
country, crushed 183 tons for £1556. The formation
which is being followed down by the shaft is also of
interest, because it has now reached a depth that cor-
responds with some of the old exploratory workings from
the Brilliant reef. If anything is struck in the shaft it
will probably mean a big run of stone, because No. 5
level can be driven more than 800 ft. before it reaches the
boundary. Still the something hasn’t been struck yet;
and judging by the New Brilliant Freehold workings,
anything that might be found would be erratic and
bunchy.

Day Dawn Block and Wyndhnrn (Charters
Towers) has now become the property of J. Millican. He
probaoly intends to do a bit of prospecting in search of
the Talisman reef, which was worked in the early days.
Shareholders have received £908,850 from the Day Dawn.

Mount Morgan has got on to the Many Peaks
copper-bearing flux at last. And, as anticipated, the
grade of the mine’s own ore fed into the furnaces has
simultaneously fallen from the extra-lofty figures which
have ruled during the last few months.
* * * *
For July Great Fitzroy (Queensland) smelted
6678 tons, alleged to assay 3£ per cent, copper and
3's3dwt. gold. The estimated production was 196 J tons
copper, llSloz. gold and 48980 z. silver. The average ex-
traction of gold wasB’63dwt., or exactly the same as the
assay ; so it is all the more curious to find that the aver-
age extraction of copper was only 2 - 9 per cent. The esti-
mated revenue, taking copper at £5B per ton, was
£13,319; and after deducting £12,646 for working costs,
there is a surplus of £673, or a fraction over 2s. per ton
of ore. Although the ore smelted was of slightly better
grade, high working costs make the return unprofitable,
for development is charged to capital and not to work-
ing account. And, unless the copper market helps,
there doesn’t seem much chance of an improvement until
the Great Fitzroy can produce blister copper; for it is
obviously working at a disadvantage so long as it has to
ship heavy consignments of matte.

“Bendigonia” is the latest mining fever to
seize some of the Queen-street crowd, with Rollason and
Brandon as whippers in. They have pegged out a square
mile or so atChewton, Castlemaine, and intend to punch
into the Silurian to pick up the Bendigo “horizon.”
Thus a new factor comes into Victorian mining, that of
applied geology, to the manifest perturbation of the
“ practical” miner. The latter blossomed out with new
splendor after 8., M. and Co.’s deep-lead failures; and
his contemptuous talk pf Bendigonia is punctuated with
remarks about the failure of the Francis Ormond, of
Castlemaine, to justify Lansell’s search after the same
special “horizon.” The present attempt is on more
scientific lines, however, for the first thing done is, not to
sink for the rocks, but to pick them up at their outcrop.
Geology seems to have settled that at Bendigo certain
rocks and the contained fossils are associated with gold.
Therefore, what has happened at Bendigo may be re-
peated in the same class of rock at Castlemaine. It is on
this hypothesis that Queen-street is building. Science is
to have a chance, and if Queen-street wins there is going
to be a new era for Castlemaine, and, incidentally, for
Victorian mining.

Someone has whispered that £2OOO is to be
handed out by the Victorian Mines Department for the
Berry United, Creswick. This was the last of the deep-
leadites turned down by J. Bull. When J. B. was
done with it, Alec Peacock picked it up at once, and as
quickly passed it on. It is said that by the time the
Ballarat co. was registered, a bit of “loading ” wasdone ;
and if that is so, there is all the less reason why the State
should rush so soon to the help of the youngster. Why
is this claim the favored one? Is it because it is the
lowest on the lead ? A poor reason that would be ; for a
claim higher up wouldhave a betterchance. Isitbecause
of Peacock’s laugh or other virtues ? A poorer reason still.
If out of sympathy for the district, there are dozens of
other centres that could have used the £2OOO better. If
to help the co., a look at the list of directors would show
that there are many others that want help more.

“ The matter of the opening up of the southern
end of your extensive property has been discussed by
several of your shareholders, who are of the opinion
that the time is opportune for floating a separate co.
to develop the ground.” Thus Mr. F. W. Holst, of Mel-
bourne, to Messieurs the directors of the Ajax Co., Bal-
larat. Ingenuous Mr. Holst ! Likewise ingenious.
Who are the shareholders that want this “ pup ’’flotation
carried through and a new co. created with fresh direc-
tors’ fees, another legal manager’s salary and other odd-
ments? Why do all this when the Ajax Co. can itself
drive out west from its southern workings and test the
Nuggety lode, or, for the matter of that, go in for a
second shaft ? Why also, if the time is opportune for a
second co.—why want to have it underwritten and £750
paid to a broker for shoving things along? If the time
be really opportune, the right man always appears to
take up shares without any broker’s sweet solicitation.
Why pay £750 commission also to raise £3OOO net? As
the shoots of ore are mainly to the south of the Ajax,
why not let the co. plug ahead there on its own behalf,
letting the new co. try its luck to the north? In short,
who inspired the little scheme, and was it begotten in
Ballarat or born in Collins-street ? Ballarat doesn’t
appear anxious to father the “pup,” so further par-
ticulars would be very interesting.

Mount Bischoff (Tas.) is showing some good-
looking faces of alluvial dirt in the northern section, and
some big benches of sand and porphyry help to supply
the mill with from 15,000 to 17,000 tons per month. It
doesn’t take much to be “ payable,” when costs amount
to less than 4s. 3d. per ton ; yet 10 per cent, of the stuff
carried by the aerial tramline is dumped as under the
limit. During the half-year 93,838 tons of dirt produced
530 tons of concentrates, which means practically 177
tons of dirt to one of concentrates. And still concen-
trates can be produced at a working cost of less than £4O
per ton, which explains the dividend of £3OOO (ss. per
share) per month on an output of only 90 tons of tin con-
centrates. The gross profit for the half-year (£25,760)
was only a shade over ss. per ton of dirt; and, even if
that average could be maintained, it would take 1,824,000
tons to produce gross profits equal to the present market
value of the shares (12,000 at £3B). Evidently operators
in Mount Bischoff shares are not looking for a fall in tin
just yet.

Shareholder: You have no solid grievance.
You asked depositors (whose money you had undertaken
to repay and couldn’t) to come in and take pref. shares
and save your bank from liquidation ; and now, being
out of the ditch, you have an idea that you shouldn’t
respect the agreement.

Waihi (M.L.) will pay a dividend of 4s. per
share in September. This will take £99,181, and make a
total of £3,962,322 paid to shareholders since the co. was
registered in 1887. These big divs. have created a deceptive
idea of the mine’s value. As said hitherto, profits have
been big because costs are low ; but the tendency of costs
will be upwards as the character of the stone'changes.
And it is pretty certain that, as its character changes, its
value will fall.
* * * *
During the first half of this year the Jew’bure
gold-mining cos. paid £4,300,000 in dividends. They still
have £100,000,000 worth of reserve ore to work on, and
from all accounts this stand-by is likely to be increased.
■ ihe area held under mining lease for all minerals
■ in Westralia increased during the past year from 58,140
acres to 59,245 acres. On the other hand, the prospect-
ing areas dwihdled in the same time from 37,631 acres to
25,645 acres, including 14,180 acres held for coal and oil.

“Janor”: Alluvial gold has been raked off
many queer bottoms in Australasia. There was, for one,
the payable wash imposed on a coal seam worked years
back in Maoriland. More remarkable still is a golden
patch recently unearthed in the bank of a Gippsland
creek. The metal was deposited on a matted false-
bottom of gum leaves and twigs, 12ft. from the grass and
2ft. above the main rock bottom. The gold, a coarse
sample, was confined to the decayed vegetable substance;
there was not a color in the wash and rock.

Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in trans-
mission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings
save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent, of oil, so one of
the first duties is naturally for engineers to direct their
special attention to these bearings and to car boxes for
trucks. Hyatts are in continuous use in Cement Works,
Ore Dressing Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bush-
ings of flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or
truck wheels, etc. Should engineers require further
details, they can apply to the Australian Agents, W. &
J. Lempriere, Melbourne ; or E. W. Hursthouse & Co.,
of Wellington, the Agents in New Zealand.*

When the hair falls it should have expert indi-
vidual treatment. The success of the Hygeia Individual
Treatment is quite wonderful.
A lady wrote a little while ago, saying her hair had
been falling out very badly for quite 15 years without
ceasing; she had tried many preparations, but nothing
did her any good, there was a lot. of dandruff, and the
scalp got very hot and irritable, also the hair was going
very grey, and was quite dry and brittle'.
After one month’s trial she wrote as follows:
“ Already I can see a little improvement, and my hair
has started to grow again. There is very little coming
out now, and the greyness has nearly all gone already,
and I will persevere with the treatment until it has quite
gone, which will not be very long, I am sure, judging by
the rate with which they are disappearing.—Yours
sincerely, L.M., Christchurch, N.Z.”
The President may be consulted, free of charge, any day
but Saturday, between 2.15 and 4.45, and on Wednesday
between 6 and 7. Those who cannot call may write to
the President, Dept. B, Hygeia Limited, Ocean House,
Moore Street, Sydney, enclosing 3d. stamps to cover
postage, and they will receive booklet and testimonials
without delay.*

The public like good value
for their money and you can’t
blame ’em seeing how hard most
of ’em have to work to earn it.
My customers are wonderfully
keen judges of groceries, both
as regards quality and prices,
especially tea. The best selling
line l have in the shop is
Rob u r there’s the No. 1
and the No. 2 Grades and you
can’t go wrong in selling either.
If every article in my stock turned
out as uniformly good and
regularly up to the standard as
Robur tea —I’d be saved a lot of
v/orry l can tell you.
Naturally 1 keep a good many
other brands of tea on my shelves,
but only one customer here
and there ever seems to care
to take ’em, whereas, I’ve hardly
ever heard of anyone refusing
to take “ROBUR.”
Of course I’d rather sell my
own tea, but when 1 can’t, well,
then 1 don’t mind selling Robur
—there’s not much made out
of it, but it gives satisfaction
and that’s the main thing.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, August 9, 1910.
Mi Dear Arini,—
Please, I’ve come back. Meow !
Java, the country that has returned me to
resume boring operations on you, is a permanent
setting for an equatorial Midsummer Night’s
Dream. One arrives at a hotel built in a gaiden
(the trees are older than the building). One
drives, rails or motors all day through jungle-
garden or landscape prospects. Amongst the hills
on the higher lands is the pageantry of agricul-
ture. Crescents of water like mirror-glass,
banked up, tier upon tier, to the cap of each hill,
are ready for rice-planting. Rice is ready for the
cutting, and coffee grows all over the warm
feet of the volcanoes. One pauses for tiffin
and afternoon tea at other hotels set in more
garden environment of fruit, flower and tree ;
and one sleeps in another garden-hostel, the lights
burning amongst the foliage all night, with never
a quiver in the windless calm. On our way to
the famous temple of Barabudur, in Central Java,
we motored through the green dusk of an avenue
of some 12,000 giant kenary trees. • Under Dutch
rule the habits of tree-planting and road-making
go together. And as they acquired the habits
quite 100 years ago, the result makes glad the
tourist travelling through the flaming hours.
When the Javanese woman—she is such a
slender little woman—is not carrying so many
pounds of baby, slung in a circular piece of printed
cotton on one hip and another load on her back,
the erectness and grace of her carriage are per-
fect. Any burden that may be carried on the
head is not borne anywhere else. We watched a
girl stepping proudly ahead of us, a bundle of
washing on her cranium, her arms hanging free.
Another native met her, took the bundle and
gave her a tiny piece of paper, possibly a receipt.
She walked on, but the carrying of the piece of
paper—first in one hand, then in the other—seemed
to distress her. Almost she shambled. Suddenly
stepping to the side of the road, she plucked a
thorn—long, hard and pointed as a darning-
needle—from a palm, and with it spitted the
paper on to her hair. Then she hastened along
again in joyous freedom.
COCOANUT TREE IN PAWN.
The Javanese man is wise. He makes no bag-
gage mule of himself while he has a wife or
daughter to dominate. We struck up acquaint-
ance by deputy —the interpreter was the deputy
—with a happy couple trudging towards a rice
field. She was carrying three children. She had
one on each hip and one on her back, and on
her head was a package of cooked rice wrapped in
banana leaves. He was making heavy weather
under the burden of a cigarette, thinner than a
slate-pencil. Two of the babies were aged re-
spectively one week and three weeks; they were
the children of mothers working in a rice patch.
The third, a rogue of nearly four years, was her
own son. Had he been a girl he would have
been trudging and carrying the week-old baby.
Later we saw this pretty bit of coffee color taking
nourishment from his mother. Afterwards
the adoring father let him have a good
pull at the slender cigarette. The woman
acknowledged that it was time she weaned the
youngster, but intimated that he had a say in the
matter.
A Javanese beauty girl must be thin and of a
golden yellow complexion. A white woman is
“ underdone,” a brown one “ overcooked ” ; but
the golden girl may have a choice in the selection
of her husband, and she goes not out in the heat
of the day. She marries a man who can keep her,
or she labors only at something easy, as, for
instance, the art industry (batik) of sarong-
making. Rather than forego the marriage feast
for his son’s or daughter’s wedding, a man will
often put his cocoanut palms into pawn. The
bridegroom may, later, secure quite a pleasant
divorce for Is. Bd. (a guilder) or less.
A cocoanut palm in pawn was to us one of the
newest things under the Javanese sun. Rather
than wait for the fatherly red-tapery and the
modest interest demanded by the Dutch Land
Credit Bank for an advance, the childish
native will pawn his rice crop or his cocoa-
nut trees to a Chinaman or a Hadji Arab at a ter-
rific rate of interest. He will pawn them for pos-
sibly a few shillings a tree. The pawnee takes
two or three cocoanuts a month as interest. Deep
consideration of this system seems
to throw a possible light on the
case of the American Indians.
Among them I should
fancy the Pawnees
were the money-
lenders and the
Flatheads borrowed
JAVANESE COOKERY.
the money. And the Sacs and Foxes were
tribes of solicitors who conducted the case when
the Pawnee sued the Flathead for the arrears.
On the first evening of our arrival at the Sim-
pang Hotel, in Soerabaya, one of the girls of our
party ha,d nearly finished dressing for dinner
when she was faced (or rather backed) by the
difficulty of fastening the two long vertical lines
of hooks and buttons of her frock. Her friends
were scattered garden blocks and verandah
lengths away, for the Simpang sprawls pictur-
esquely over a, large area. No women, white or
brown, are employed in the hotels. The “boys”
speak only Malay, and she couldn’t very well ask
the manager to fasten her gown, even if she knew
his Dutch whereabouts. She was standing oppo-
site her mirror searching a phrase book for the
Malay equivalent for “I want my frock hooked ”
when the door opened soundlessly, her bedroom
“ boy ” came in, whisked possible mosquitoes out
of a bed as big as a Sydney villa lawn, carefully
overlapped the nets, then slid up behind the
absorbed student, and had several hooks done
before she knew he had anticipated her need.
Then he looked complacently at his reflection
over her shoulder, settled the rabbit-ear bows of
his turban, seized the girl’s white canvas shoes, and
silently stole away. He slept every night on a
grass mat just outside her door.
Tropical beds are luxuriously simple. One fine
linen sheet stretched tightly over a perfectly even
horsehair mattress 6ft.. wide, two pillows, and the
long bolster known as a Dutch Wife, are the pro-
visions. No bedclothing is necessary (save in the
high lands), for the average temperature is 80
degrees, and it varies little. Throughout the
Javan hotels the bedroom and its furnishings
always supplied a theme of admiring comment.
At Singapore we were exchanging small chronicles
with a young Westralian, and mentioned vain-
gloriously the large, white space Java gave
each of us to sleep over. He was not impressed,
and even waxed arrogant over the size of his own
apartment and couch in some rather minor hotel
a few streets away. We did not believe him.
He was hurt, and a challenge was given and
accepted. The whole of our party and a tape-
measure set out in rickshaws for his quarters.
We measured his room. It was 19ft. by 27ft.
We measured his bed. It was nine feet wide.
The Westralian said he often went for an early
morning walk without getting out of bed. We
christened him Og, because the only other gigan-
tic bedstead >ve had heard of belonged to Og,
King of Bashan. The Scripture tells that it was
a bedstead of iron ; “nine cubits was the length
thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it.” But
for whom or for how many was the Singapore
couch built ?
Not riiany of King George’s subjects are resi-
dent in Java. About 40 English and Australians
dwell at Soerabaya, the commercial centre of
the Dutch East Indies, which has a Dutch and
native population of about 200,000. Mr. Norbert
Campbell, a young Sydney-sider, a son of Mr.
Frederick Campbell, of Waverley, seems to have
achieved much prosperity in commerce there.
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Chambers were recent and
agreeable additions to the English-speaking
colony. He is a cousin of Haddon Chambers and
of Miss Agnes Chambers, of musical and play-
producing fame in this city. Mrs. Chambers is
a pretty and clever young woman, who has
learned to speak Malay quite fluently in a few
months. It was at her adorable little Dutch villa
that we first saw the cooking arrangements that
obtain in private households in Java.
Three stoves or braziers, not larger than average
flower-pots, stood on the stone floor of the kitchen.
A handful (literally not more than a handful) of
charcoal glowed in each, under a little braising pan.
Squatting opposite them was the little senior
“ koki,” fanning the charcoal with a tiny folding
fan, which she presently thrust into the waist of
her sarong. Her daughter, the assistant “koki,”
squatted silently, like a little brown broody hen.
The husband of the elder woman squatted outside
near a washing-up stand. No one seemed to be
doing anything or to be about to do anything. It
was all suggestive of a doll’s house, and with
scarcely any evidence of the delightful dinner of
six courses that was served only half an hour
Jater.
And when we went back immediately after
dinner to have another gloat there were no signs
that there had been a dinner. The three little
stoves were on a shelf, and all the servants had
gone home. Apparently they had washed up by
magic. The servants sleep in their villages, and
come to work at 5 a.m.
At Singapore we had news of our one-time
visitor, the Sultan of Johore. He has become
greatly wealthy through rubber. The Singapore
races, usually a great event, were just over, but
out of respect for a deceased brother potentate
(Ed. VII.), Johore had withdrawn his string of
eight horses from the running. We crossed the
glistening ribbon of water that separates his
dominion from Singapore, prowled through his
huge and amazingly ugly mosque, and had tea
at his amazingly fine hotel, where we ate
the first cake—cake as we know it in our
own country—that we had seen since leaving
Australia. Within the shadow of tb«* mosque we
ran against two Westralians. Q e was Mr.
Saunders, a well-known Perth mining man ; and
the other was a young barrister of sorts—a vital
spark named Crawcour. The encounter caused
our originality to take the form of remarking
“ How small the world is.”
But it is time to give N.S.W. chronicles a
show:—
If mine were a crowned head it should not yacht
: with Thomas Lipton. Last week, with the King
of Spain, a brace of Princes and a Duke on board,
his careless vessel, Shamrock IJI., spilled what
the cable terms “half a ton of spar” on the
deck. On another memorable Occasion Edward
VII. just missed intercepting the entire top-
hamper of a Lipton vessel with his skull, as he sat
unsuspectingly below. Lipton has no luck with
his royal guests, or, rather, they have none with
him. Strictly from his viewpoint, a royal
tragedy aboard one of his vessels would be good
business. What an advt. for his teas ! Picture
the way the grocery sales would bound if Lipton
wereindicted for regicjdeor something, and obliged
to identify the bloodstain on the main halliard
or balloon jib or what not, while the daily
papers indicated, by means of the time-hallowed
cross, the exact portion of the deck from which
the monarch’s flattened remains were gathered
up. Such a priceless reclame is too overwhelming
a temptation to be safely placed within the reach
of any human business man, however loyal.
Possibly a dim realisation of this accounts for the
aversion royalties, etc., have always been under-
stood to feel, hitherto, for “persons in trade.”
Major Maxwell, V.C., arrived in Sydney last
week, for a three months’ stay. He married, four
years ago, Miss Charlotte Osborne, of N.S.W.’s
Currandooley Osborne family. He is one of
“Kitchener’s men,” which is understood to mean
that he knows the war game right through.
A wedding of the wattle-scented September
will be that of Miss Leila McPhillamy, of the
Jack McP.’s, of Bathurst, to a Mr. Maxwell, of
Tasmania.
Four kindly fellow-passengers of mine on the
Linschoten, the Dutch liner from equatorial
parts, gave me some coin for the Hospice at Dar-
linghurst. It is hereby acknowledged : Mr.
Treadway and Mr. Fitzgerald, of Melbourne, £1
each ; Mr. Lohman, late of Soerabaya, £1; and
Captain Clarke, of Rose Bay, and Mr. Baldwin,
of Port Moresby, 10s. each.
Mosman’s annual ball to help swell the funds of
the Mater Misericordise Hospital for Women and
Children (Gore Hill) occurred at the local civic
hall on Tuesday of last week. A crowded house
foregathered to make things merry, and, inci-
dentally to vote for what, in its opinion, was con-
sidered the most original fancy set. Mrs. O. S.
Wilson’s “Ebony” was an easy winner, and the
lady had some silverware shoved at her. Her
exhibit was made up of 32 local youths and maids
lamp-blacked and black-robed from head to sole.
Black has been the winning and fashionable hue
of late. It is either a delicate compliment to Mr.
Johnson or a prolongation of the Royal mourning.
The medical catch of the season, Dr. Blackburn,
was taken by Miss Vera Le Patou rel last week at
the venerable ceremony known to the literary
genius of the daily press as “a quiet but pretty
wedding.” (The “ but” suggests that other gem
of reporterese : “ His name is Smith, but it is
thought he may recover.” It implies that a thing
that is noisy, like a foundry or a railway col-
lision, or a bottle-oh, is naturally beautiful
while a quiet affair like the lakes of Killarney
only achieves beauty after an uphill fight.) The
bride’s way of wearing her veil was a “revival.”
It was done almost as you would put on a fringe
net. Miss Drexel, the American moneyed beauty,
is shown by fashion-paper portraits to have faced
the altar with her veil worn as someone’s great-
grandmother wore hers. Sweet-pea sheaves were
carried at the pretty Sydney girl’s wedding as the
Blessed Damozel holds her lilies in Rosetti’s
picture.
Young Lily Delaney, daughter of a really dis-
tinguished Australian musician, will depart for
London in a few months, after she has given a
concert in the Town Hall. A meeting at the
Australia next Monday will talk the matter over.
The Lily girl plays both piano and violin well.
Mrs. and Miss Yesey, Emily Soldene’s sister
and niece, are staying at the Wentworth. The
gentle-looking girl is doing well in a Tivoli item.
Mr. and Mrs. Wybert Preston, travelling Ameri-
cans, are other visitors. She has the choicest of
frocks and the most beautiful red hair that could
not be mistaken for other than the thatch that
Providence was pleased to give her.
Florence Young, garbed in brown and huddled
in chestnut furs, hurried through Sydney last
week on her way to Brisbane. She dropped notes
of exclamation and admiration all the way over the
memoryof Amy Castles’s performance in “Madam
Butterfly.”
Those who like the Unusual Drama will find
the goods at the next Stage Society’s show at the
Standard Theatre on August 19. Three one-act
plays are to be presented, with excellent casts.
Sudermann’s grim tragedy, “Fritzehen,” never
before given in English, is regarded as one of the
best modern one-act tragedies. “In a Work-
house Ward,” by Lady Gregory, of Abbey Theatre
fame, represents the characteristic humor of the
new Irish drama. “Pierrot in Australia,” a new
fantasy by Arthur H. Adams, sounds promisingly
Australian in conception. Pierrot plays and
Pierrot pantomimes are a commonplace on the
French stage. It will be interesting to see how
the gentleman with the white face and the choux
and the skull cap and the frivolous heart will get
on in the Australian backblocks. Though the
society has a rapidly-growing subscription list. it
is not yet quite independent of the general public.
Hence the announcement that the box plan is at
Paling’s. Yours affectionately, Akenehi.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 8, 1910.
My Dear Yakrie,—
The Arts and Crafts are having: quite a splash
in the Collins-street rooms. The Carmichael lady
prods the workers at times into fresh energy,
where laces and embroideries are concerned. She
is a keen needlewoman, and knows the awful
mysteries of “pearl two—chain—drop one.”
This show has a dash of everything. Furniture of
local design for Australian woods reveals common-
sense in its craft, as well as art in its construction.
It consists of beautiful blackwood things without
frills and corners to foster the accumulation of
dust. Someone in the near country sent a wool
mat—a glorified thing like a Persian rug. It
fetched ten guineas. Imagine a Margaret Ogilvie
or a Mrs. Hiram Greencorn getting ten guineas
for a winter evening’s work. It shows what
culchaw in design can do to glorify grandma’s wool
mat. Blamire Young carries off the prize for poster
work. A powerful, red-faced Beef-eater, with
fat rolls of flesh ridging his neck in a realistic
way, is one design. Another shows a maiden
draped in a lace mantle. Blamire Young gets
into a class all by himself when it comes to
fabrics, and his detail in a room is purely Dutch.
Moreover, he has a spreading design of gum leaves
for a screen.
Ballarat sent along some considerable work,
including very effective designs for jewellery and
book covers. Ballarat seems to have got a craze
for Kangaroo apple (Monkey apple is what school
children call the green and golden thing), and the
Ape vegetable twists in and out of a dozen
designs. A Margery Mitchell hit out a bit
strongly with the weed, and some bronze of hers
was worth while.
The gubernatorial secretary, Victor Hood, who
has become quite a naturalised Australian, colla-
borated with (miniature) Kricheldorff in photo-
prints of many far corners of Australia. There
were leather things more beautiful than the ultra-
artistic Roycroft-boomed bits ; and Jessie Simp-
son, who has a name now for her pottery, sent in
dainty cups and plates. The encouragement of
the Arts is doing good. So many people are
deft-fingered and clever of design, but all un-
tutored in the business-like use of their talents ;
and the society helps to get the work into a
marketable channel. Artists so often lack even a
ghost of a business instinct.
It will almost seem that the hospitals should
offer up prayers of thankfulness for the death of
a king, for with ordinary gaiety turned off at the
meter a tornado of social events is being perpe-
trated in the name of charity. Social people
must spend their energy somewhere, or burst from
suppression of steam. This winter affairs have
been mourned out of ordinary focus, and the
dances, bridge parties and matinees have all been
for the sake of sweet benevolence.
The Foundling Hospital has its bazaar in Octo-
ber ; but that is so far off that it stands good
for another blow-out earlier. So certain persons
have risen up in full blast to give it a masked
ball in September. The little foundlings may
just sit back and smile, for that masked ball will
be a snorter. Mrs. Tallis went and sat on Sar-
good’s damp doorstep what time that big ware-
house was overwhelmed by cataracts, and smilingly
garnered in calico in rolls and bales. The up-bi-
date lady conceived the idea of making dominoes
for the ball out of calico begged from Sargood. The
dominoes will be sold to dancers, but the hoppers
will return them later on to the committee to make
sheeting for the hospital. It was a brilliant idea,
and the calico is safe even if the domino idea is
dumped.
Mrs. Tallis is working in such a systematic way
that her husband has offered her a job in the
firm. To send a woman abroad to choose opera
stars might not fall far short of an inspiration.
To get going in definite work Mrs. Tallis gave
a tea. It was a glorified tea at the Vienna, with
violet posies at every plate and several courses of
sweets. Afternoon tea is developing these days
of No Lunch. Mrs. Surgeon O’Hara—who seems
to have a professional feeling for hospital chari-
ties —was present, with gold mercury wings in her
hat. Mrs. “ Oriental ” Tewkesbury nodded pink
roses in her discussions, and Mrs. Ted Tait was a
picture in lilac flower color. Mrs. Scott, grasping
a raffle book, wore a Parisian thing like a tube of
macaroni—so creamy-white and narrow and long
was her outer garment. Mrs. Tallis wore a parrot
in her hat—a rosella with a Pagliacci collar round
its neck—and some green about her black togs.
The whole party got excited over the stand taken
by the imposing town clerk. Town clerks are
always weighty. This one refuses to allow adver-
tisements to be hung over the balconies, and the
wailing is heathenish. “ Why, Sydney got £l5O
for its balcony advertisement alone,” they say.
“ This ball's grot to pay,” they also remark. “ The
bazaar may —but who ever knew a bazaar to
pay.” Society women who give things to stalls
buy them back if they are not sold. They might
just as well give the lump sum in the beginning
and be done with the worry.
Her Majesty’s people are thick in it for the
hospital bazaar. Mrs. Secretary Tait has a baby
doll to raffle. Mrs. Tallis has a case of whisky on
her shoulder, so to speak. Mrs. Architect Pitt is
well in the running, and Mrs. Printer Syd Day is
up to her eves in doings for the Foundling bene-
dictions. There is to be a bridge party soon—a
Camberwell bridge party. Guests pay for their
tables, and give the Cause half the winnings. An
idea evolved over the muffins and date sand-
wiches of a tea party was to have several poker
tables for the men ; charge them a. pound or two
a table (“They’ll pay it easily, my dear—for
poker! ”) and hand over half their winnings.
Yes, this bazaar or masked ball is likely to be a
live thing.
The mayoral Burston lady rushes into another
party next week. She is At Home to the Car-
michaels and dimmer luminaries in the Town
Hall for an afternoon crush.
The Billsons, who gave a ball, are having the
like done unto them. A return to their Mayoral’
Mightinesses is fixed for August 22. The same
brilliancy is guaranteed, and the same 2 a.m. car-
riage programme.
Another clan of the moneyed and motored is
added to the black list of mourning. Mr. F. S.
Grimwade, the elder brother of the big Felton,
Grimwade, chemists, died last week, and the
blinds are down over the eyes of the Caulfield
house. , ...
The upper room of the Athenaeum, which has
mostly been anathema, seems to have found its
corner in life at last. People gave health lectures
there in an atmosphere that would stifle a sala-
mander, and flower-show folk, who put their ex-
hibits on the premises, were saved the expense of
a hot-house. Now the Athenaeum men have-
realised that it is necessary to “do something.”
So the great apartment (it is about 60ft. long) has
been re-ventilated and supplied with a proper
studio roof-light, and has been hung with a buff
background to give pictures a show. The artists
rushing the dates now. Withers, who is in
the lead, gives an exhibition there on August 11,
and others follow thickly.
The principle of “every man his own shover”
doesn t always act smoothly—especially when a
young and gallant shover gets his car stuffed full
of pretty girl. Then it sometimes turns his head.
A young hero by the name of Steele had his
motor-load last week. At some railway gates he
descended to do mysterious things to the innards
of Ins car. Then the young man began to
churn the mangle handle—to wind the jigger up
to go, and idiotically left his car in gear. The
live thing rushed off, bowled him over, tore
through the railway gates, and carried a squealing
cargo of Girl—not a one of them knowledgable
enough to turn the stopping crank for a paralysed
10 minutes or so. By that time the road was
strewn with Girl (mostly St. Kilda) and hysterics.
William Anderson invited the big guns of the
Federal and State Houses, also their wives and
other people of importance within our gates, to
the King’s one recent wet afternoon. The show
was the first biograph picture of that well-known
Australian drama, “The Squatter’s Daughter.”
For typically Australian pictures, one could
scarcely go better. In staging the drama, how-
ever good the scenery, the trees can only be
painted trees and the landscape a painted effect.
In the pictures the gums wave and tremble.
They are real gums. The sunlight makes clear
shadows over the hard, dry roadways, and the
rocks and cliffs look old granite and aged
geological formations instead of unstable papier
mache. The drama is boiled down to its most
dramatic points. Authors Bert Bailey and
Duggan have toiled at the boiling process in the
intervals of their daily graft. In the pictures
the mummer gentlemen have taken things very
seriously, especially at the intense moments of
mounting and dismounting from horribly un-
familiar beasts called horses. Even if wishes
were horses, I don’t believe mummers would ride.
You can see an anxious and soundless “woa-a”
forming on the unhappy horseman’s lips every
time he drags a gee-gee near him. The film,
though it is condensed into cable code, is over
6000 ft. long. That means more than a mile of
“ Squatter’s Daughter.” Truly she is a tall girl
when she is standing up, and a long girl when she
is lying down.
Marion Alsop gave a recital last week that was
wholly Marion Alsop. There was a variety of voices
producing Marion Alsop, but the compositions
were all hers. Beauteous society damsels like
Beatrice Madden and Miss Emmerton helped pro-
fessional people in the voicing, and demonstrated
that they have been well trained. Miss Madden
has a charming voice, and it continues to improve.
There is music in the family. Cousin Doris
does extraordinary things with the piano, and
even fat Guy is known to warble passably.
Marion Alsop’s songs are making quite big rings
in the pond which means Fame. All the big stars
who Hash here for awhile have taken some of her
compositions away with them. They are purely
lyrical and are all sweet melody. The house oil
Monday was made up of fashionable folk who
didn’t mind motoring in the wet. But even the
best of songs grow monotonous when one listens
to 21 by the same composer. The Malinsons got
just as near boring with their wonderful concerts.
The audience gave just a little polite yawn of
relief at the end of the programme, though the
fare all through was exceedingly good. A baby
song, “The Rebel,” appealed especially to
womenkind ; and Miss Alsop’s lullaby songs are
quite distinctive in a gentle, purring way.
Puccini has Melbourne by the ear. Either
Melbourne is showing signs of extreme culchaw
or else the posters give the majority the impres-
sion that “Butterfly” is comic opera. Anyhow,
there are the houses—packed every night and
going one better even than the learned Shak-
spearian revival. The week nights have had
their wild crushes; but the second Satur-
day of the showing was a bedlam—a most
desirably dressed and cheerful bedlam. The
Races people poured in on top of the “regulars ”
of the music-lovers, and many went sorrowfully
away. Amy Castles has been amazing her
friends. That lazy young singer seems to have
wakened to hard work. For her first attempt at
grand opera she is doing wonderful things. Last
Saturday was her biggest triumph. She has shaken
down into harness, and puts herself right into the
part. But it is hard luck for any girl to have violent
love bestowed upon her by either of the available
tenors. One is a fat, white tenor who bays out in
uncomfortable curves. The second tenor curves
inwardly in strong contrast. Also, these tenors
(speaking from a feminine point of view, which
demands beauty of looks or clothes in the juvenile
lead) wear such ill-fitting duck suits. The fat
tenor is fitted too tightly, and the lean one is
shockingly limp about the hang of his duds—
especially for a naval footenant and a stage one at
that. It is a keen disappointment to the sweet
girls—ready to adore the hero. He is hardly the
type that charmed the flappers in Fleet Week.
Nevertheless they don’t remember that the Fleet
gentlemen could sing so sweetly. They shut one
eye on him and use the other for taking in the
prima donna’s kimonos. Bel Sorel wears beauteous
things—although she puts them on over a
Parisianlv-corseted figure. Amy Castles flashes
quite a fresh series of her own—pink and gold and
white, and wisteria tinted. Probably Pampari,
who thirds the triplet, will dazzle next week’s
houses with another half-dozen.
But the kimono of the tiny, tiny Japnevermakes
a truly graceful covering for larger-sized species
of the feminine human. Bel Sorel scores in one
setting—as a picture. The curtain rise of the
second act sees her lying prone on her cushions,
with her dainty chin on the curved ebony head-
rest, with cinnamons and browns and golds flow-
ing away from her in silky draperies. She sings
like a lark from this flattened-out pose—with
cherry-tree blooms in the doorways behind her.
Amy does not attempt it—it takes a brave woman
to sing in such flattened circumstances—but be-
stows her plumpness on the squatting cushions
near the screen. The color scheme is a satisfying
thing. It lacks somewhat in the chorus—but then
the chorus is only on for half an act.
The singers complain that Hazon treats them
in a very secondary offhand way. His whole soul
is in his “ orchest,” as he calls it. But «the opera
is purely an orchestral opera. The whole expres-
sion is woven out in orchestral themes, with the
voice as an incidental. The sadness of the music
grips one. All last week just ordinary society
folk (not merely the rabid musicians) were
dragged out three successive nights just by the
haunting of that music. They go despite their
protests that they are faithful to the earlier
Puccini “Boheme.” The musical people are
mostly up in the gods, where Goths have just
ceased whistling ‘‘ Berlin on the Spree.” Marshall
Hall sits every night in the dress-circle and says
“ Hussssh ”, to disturbers in a voice like a strong
west wind—making more noise than a dozen
ordinary rustling mice. Hazon turned round and
glared on Saturday night.
The opera looks well for a ripping, season—
which must be a weight off the management’s
chest. Who ever knows how a fickle town will
take grand'opera?
It is funny to watch an Italian tenor. True
to their “school,” they always grab the centre
of the stage. Tenor Italiano Pinkelton, supposed
to be singing soulful chum converse with his
brother American, the Consul, suddenly darts
away and makes an egg-shaped mouth at the
audience, what time he shouts his singing lines.
He returns to gaze at the answering Consul, then
makes another wild dart.
By the bye, that same Consul should keep off
the grass in the wedding scene. Perhaps, as he
does not take a turn at the official quill to sign,
he is supposed to be legally dead or absent or
drowned. But a Japanese-cwm-American marriage
before the U.S. Consul is supposed to be valid in
’Murka and other English-speaking countries.
“It’s a point to bear in mind,” as they sing in
comic opera, but it doesn’t interfere with the fas-
cinating, tremulous music. So let it rip.
To comorm with the regulation beauty man on
a United States war boat, Lieutenant fiootenant
to be strictly ’Murkan) F. B. Pinkerton should be
clean-shaven and wear his hair in an immaculate
parting ; but neither of the tenors in “ Butterfly ”
approach the lovely ideal. One wears his foliage
in a long, curly bunch parted on one side, like a
small boy of the plush-pants period. The other
droops a tangled curtain of hairy garniture over
his mouth. Approached on the matter, they both
glare wildly and threaten to smash their engage-
ment and the whole show rather than sacrifice
their darling hair. Fat Roly-poly Tenor won’t
cut his hair, and Thin Warbler refuses to shave.
Mr. Moustachios only bends to popularity by
sprinkling reddish gold dust on his black locks ;
but he sings through the mouth curtain.
From “Rosna,”of Adelaide: —
Since our Pageant of Fashion in aid of dead beasts,
last Wednesday night, we have come to the conclusion
that we are a brilliant and artistic people, and we defy
you to prove it. Also, we are financial giants. If you
don’t believe it look at the Pageant’s bank balance,
which, at latest, was climbing up to the giddy altitude
of £5OO. The Exhibition barn was packed to the last
foot of space—the entire floor at ss. a head, the lower
gods at 35., the upper at 2s. and Is. Then, if you wished
to know the name of the Trojan lady in the pink night
rail, or the Greek god in purple hose, you bought a
souvenir bookletforanotherhalf-crovvn. A resolve to dance
with the Trojan lady later on cost you 3s. extra. There
your expenditure ended for the evening ; but it would
have been worth while at six times the cash. There wasn’t
a single hitch in the revel. A 1910 vice-regal daughter
in a smart cream satin and lace array, and picture hat,
led the procession with a 1066 sister in palest green and
heliotrope, her locks concealed beneath a thick gold net,
and carrying a hawk on her arm. Behind the up-to-date
maid the fashions went gradually backwards ; behind the
remote one they advanced. Each line went round the
hall and twice up and down the centre, finishing in a
well-grouped tableau on the stage. There were brocades
and jewels, crinolines and farthingales, frocks frilled to
the waist, and parasols a foot in diameter. There were
mild, early, and stiff mid‘Victqrian ladies ; there were
gorgeous raiments that cost many guineas and gorgeous
clothes that did not. The name of the loveliest of the
crowd was Legion. (I don’t know her Christian appella-
tion—possibly Sarah.)
For artistic beauty the Tableaux ran the Pageant neck
and neck. You may remember the committee borrowed
artist Violet Teague from Melbourne, and she painted
backgrounds and designed frocks and supervised poses
for each dream of fair women. The result was very fine.
The Trojan women, with Mrs. Driscoll as Helen ; Jephtha’s
Daughter (Mrs. Gordon Ayers); and Joan of Arc, in the
person of Monica Murray, were specially deserving of the
loud timbrel. The color schemes were all exquisite, and
the pictorial effect, heightened by a stretched net and
good lighting, quite uncanny. Musical interludes from
Mrs. Georgina Delmnr and the Tramway band, and slices
of the “Dream of Fair Women,” recited by Mrs. Reeves,
adequately filled up the pauses between pictures.
Their Exes, and the whole peerage were present; but
I know two people who didn’t see either Pageant or
Tableau. They were Mrs. J. R. Anderson and Mrs. Box,
who originated the revel and did most of the work, and
took any stray blame that was going, and made tactful
remarks to 200 women all wanting to do the thing in 209
different ways. They couldn’t be spared for such mere
frivolities as looking on. Mr. Minchin, who is the kindl
uncle of all the animals in the Zoo, was secretary.
We have been living at the Exhibition barn lately, for
two Calv 6 qoncerts preceded the Pageant, and mightily
packed they were. The first night the Excellent party
was present. Calv 6, in an olive-green sequined confec-
tion and various lovely scarfs, twinkled at a dense crowd,
and the crowd opened its mouth in astonishment when
she wandered over the stage as she sang. It kept its
mouth open too, and its yells of applause were dis-
tinctly heard at Kangaroo Island. On Monday the
multitude caipe early and brought its dinner
along. The Bosapquet maidens and a girl chum, with
Mr. Baillie Hamilton as guardian angel, were there, and
so many other people that there wasn’t room even for a
ghost. The Calvd frock was a mermaidenly affair of silver
chain armor, fringed with pearls, and once more there
were scarves of various denominations, including a good,
little, religious, white scarf and a wicked, old, golden
one. Calv 6 didn’t encourage the insatiable greed of the
populace, and it ha(l to be content with 20 smiles and
one encore.
Manufactures Day, wfien every shop is encouraged to
wear goods and girls “made in our own country,” has
been fixed for September 13.
The large and top-heavy suburb of Norwood was
chopped into two last week and asked to dance before
the mayoral Prossers ip sections on the evenings of
Wednesday and Friday. Miles of saffron floricult ure and
asparagus fern coiled itself round the Town Hall; exotic
paper blooms nodded through saffron lattice-ways, and
swung on saffron hoops from the ceiling, and -affron
lights danced quadrilles among them. The hostess was
in cream satin veiled with sequined net. On Wednesday
night, she had the Ministry and its wife, and the sur-
rounding mayoralties and their nicer halves to dance an
official set with her.
On July 30 Cuthbert Wells, son of the architect of that
ilk, gave some deserving musician a job at playing “The
Voice that Breathed.” His partner in the venture w>as
Miss Pooler, daughter of a Mount Lofty medieo, and the
scene was at St. Peter’s College chapel.
We are worried ! Long ago, Adelaide took the plane
tree to its heart, and planted that herb all over the parks
and gardens, up King William-road, and everywhere a
tree would grow. Now some uncomfortable person has
announced that in the spring a plane tree’s fancy lightly
turns to thoughts of pneumonia. Dr. Holtze, of the
Botanic Gardens, when consulted, said the fact was
scarcely news, because a Greek gentleman named DiOs-
corides had discovered it in the pale-blue ages before
Julius Caesar climbed the Andes. And yet the world has
gone on recklessly planting plane trees ever since.
Mr. Bevan’s choral angels and seraphim are going to
wail Sullivan’s “Golden Legend” at the Town Hall in
October. Proceeds go to help the home for weak-minded
babes.
Douglas Mawson, of the Pole, has been further initiat-
ing us into the habits of the blizzard, w'hich roams at
large down below zero. From his description it is a very
tidy beast, and has been strictly brought up to habits of
order. Although it carried half the goods and chattels of
t
he Shackleton camp away each time it passed the back,
door, it always deposited them in exactly the same spot,
a quarter of a mile away, and in good order. Dr. Mawson
tried to capture a tame blizzard to teach us domestic
economy, but it broke i ts leg-rope and escaped in the night.
That expedition was a model of politeness. One day Pro-
fessor David slipped down a crevasse. Dr. Slawson was
busy taking photographs, and didn’t notice what had
happened. The Professor didn’t like to disturb him in
his photography, and clung on until he could cling no
longer. Then, with profuse apologies, he asked if his
colleague could spare time to help him up! No less
than 100 people have applied for inclusion in the Scott
expedition. When they bring back the Pole with them
we are going to put it in the freezing works at Port
Adelaide.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

Mr i L V W - who h . eld the very highest testimonials from some of the
best known directorates in both Western Australia and Queensland, was selected as the person
A* te * to «“P®e* md wport np<m the concessions, and the following are a few extracts
- 0 ™ yeport, dated 9th May, 1910, which is based on what he actually saw, and the informa-
obtamed from reliable sources, chiefly Government Officials, during his visit:—
Ihe inspection 1 made was by both land and water as far as practicable owing to the
density of the Mangrove trees At Cooktown I found it almost impossible to
make a proper estimate of the quantity of Black Mangrove Bark in sight, but I
should say about 8000 tons. This estimate is only naturally, approximate. Fresh
water and firewood are procurable almost anywhere throughout the concessions.
Labor is obtainable from permanent aboriginal camps at Starcke River, Princess
Charlotte Bay, and numbers of natives camped at these places can be worked on
contract, allowing so much per bag of one cwt. From Cooktown. to Starcke River
Black Mangroves are scarce. At Starcke River Black Mangroves abound, and trees
up to 9in. and 12in. in diameter are plentiful. Native labor, owing to a permanent
camp here, is also adequate for your requirements. The next patch of Black Man-
groves is at the Jeannie River, and the trees are of a fair size. From the .Teannie
River there 'are no Black Mangroves until you come to Princess Charlotte Bay where
there are eight rivers, all of which abound in Black Mangroves, some of the largest
growing here, piles being -cut 50 feet long. Here, also, the natives are camped
permanently, and can be utilised for bark getting. Evanson, a local contractor, de-
clares this to be the best place to erect works. In conclusion, I have no hesitation
in saying the quantity of Black Mangrove Bark is unlimited.”
It is greatly to be regretted that Mr. Rayfield died somewhat suddenly on the 22nd June,
1910, a few weeks after making his inspection and returning with a sample of bark which he
handed over to Mr. F. Coombs, Demonstrator on Tannery at the Technical College, in sealed
bags, for the purpose of analysis, and obtaining Mr. Coombs’ report upon it.
ANALYSIS AND REPORT ON BARK OBTAINED BY THE LATE MR. J. W. RAYFIELD,
FROM THE COMPANY’S CONCESSIONS.
Under date 25th May, 1910, Mr, F. A. Coombs, Leather Trades Chemist, Sydney Technical
College, wrote:—
“I received about Vz ton slightly mouldy. This would not do much harm as I under-
stand the bark had only been cut about 2 weeks. Bark cut at this time of the
year (winter) when the sap is down, would not show as much tannin as when cut in
season. You must understand that the bark I analysed was not picked out, and the
outer dead scales, which were all taken off: in any previous samples sent to me, were
in this case left on. Mr. Rayfield and I were of the same opinion, that in your case
when dealing with bark, this dead outer casing would have to be weighed in when
checking for general expenses per ton. In Mangrove Bark you have a tanning ma-
terial which contains 100 per cent, more tannin than those materials from which the
American,: German, and English Tanners draw their supplies as follows: —
(Bark) Hemlock 8 to 14 per cent, tannin.
Quebracho Wood about 20 per cent, tannin
Oak Bark 12 to 14 per cent, tannin.
Mimosa Bark (Wattle) and Mallet are equal to Mangrove, but their supply is limited.”

On 18th June, 1910, Mr. Coombs wrote:- —
‘‘Cannot furnish results on the experimental tanning for Some considerable time. I am
quite aware of the disadvantages when tanning with Mangrove Bark, but these are
mostly the troubles of unskilled tanners. Mangrove Bark extracts are used largely
at the present time by shrewd tanners who do not make a noise about it. All my
work goes to prove that you have a very strong tanning material which is capable of
giving an extract which is second to none in per centage of tannin.”
(Sgd.) F. COOMBS.
And on Ist August, Mr. Coombs added the following.—‘‘l have not noted any point which
would make one differ from Professor H. R. Proctor, who describes Mangrove Bark
as producing a good leather, and yielding an extract which promises well as a sub-
stitute for Cutch, to which for dyeing purposes it is nearly or quite equal. He fur-
ther states that Mangrove Bark is now largely used in combination with pine, oak, and
mimosa. The solid extract contains up to 65 per cent, of tannin. See ‘‘The Prin-
ciples of Leather Manufacture,” Page 283.

ABSTRACT FROM THE REPORT OF MR. G. HARRISON RUSSELL,
Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain, and member of the International Associa-
tion of Leather Trades, Chemists and trained in the Technology of Leather Industries at Leeds
University under Professor Proctor, and in Tanyard practice at Parker Bros., Bristol, dated Ist
December, 1909:
“Within comparatively recent years Mangrove Bark has come largely into favor as a tan-
ning agent, especially in continental Europe where the demand has grown to enormous
proportions, and it is now systematically harvested and exported, notably to Belgium
and Germany. The Bark from the different species of Mangrove varies considerably
in astringency, but the variety ‘Ceriop’ is reputed the best commercially, the Tannin
value in some cases ranging as high as 50%, and rarely falling below 30%. Phe
Bark is either exported as such or is converted into Mangrove Cutch by extraction
with water and evaporating this infusion until solid extract is obtained. The possr
bilities of creating an export trade from so large concessions are great. The cost ot
collecting and preparing the Bark for the market is comparatively small, and it is com
sidered that Queensland is in a position to compete, under favorable conditions, with
the principal sources of European supplies, e.g., the East Coast of Africa, British In-
dia, North Borneo, etc. Mangrove Cutch is largely used by dyers of woollens and
other fabrics, and it seems to have taken the place, to some extent, of the true Cutcti
produced in North East India and in Burma, from the wood of Acacia.

Mr. Leonard C. Green, of the Technical Laboratory, Brisbane, has supplied a report tnat
the Mangrove Bark contains 43.34% of tannic acid, that it is a splendid dye, and that it to
tains other marketable products. He also is of opinion that the establishment of such an in
dustry cannot fail to confer many boons upon the leather trade, and be lasting and highly p
able. He states the dye that gives the leather a reddish color can be easily extracted from t
tannic acid in the . course of extraction. . ~ . bark
Analysis of the bark shows a much higher per centage of tannic acid than any other hark
in Australia or New Zealand; in fact, the analysis proves it to give the highest P®r centage ot
any bark known in the world. This is exactly what the tanners and bark merchants want, as
the supply of wattle and other barks is yearly growing less, and prices are likely'to keep
rising. Leather tanned by Mangrove Bark, and sold by Messrs. Wmchcombe, Carson, Lt „
in Sydney, brought the highest price obtained for leather of a weight at the sales.
Mr. Charles Vider of Messrs. Winchcombe, Carson & Co., Ltd., under dates 26th and 27th
July, 1910, writes as follows, viz.— „ . . . .
“I have no hesitation in repeating that the leather was always well tanned and invariably
topped the market. With further reference to Mangrove tanned leather sold by this
Company, I wish to inform you that in a general sense the quality was of a very high
grade, and extreme market prices were always readily obtained. Manufacturers were very
sorry when the shipments ceased. With possibly one exception we have not since
received any leather equal to it. Its reddish color had long since ceased to be an

m< EXTRACTS e FROM LETTERS RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH SALE OF CUTCH.
The following are extracts from two letters, dated 30th June, 1910, received from a firm o
selling agents, which should satisfy all concerned that £2O is a fair price to quote for Cutch pei
ton.
Letter No. 1. »
“We have offered to sell your output of Mangrove Bark (Cutch), up to or over 1000 tons
per annum, for one, two, three, or five years, at £2O per ton delivered at Hamburg,
London, Liverpool, or Glasgow, provided the quality Cutch is acceptable for general
market purposes in the respective trades for which it is used.”
Letter No. 2.
“Sale of Cutch. —We will undertake to sell the 1000 tons or any larger quantity you can
produce, provided reasonable notice is given to us, and that you do not ask us to take
more than 25% above the 1000 tons in any one year, subject to the terms and con-
ditions stated in my previous letter of this date.”
ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE AND RETURNS FOR FIRST WORKING YEAR.
The most careful and extensive inquiries have been made as to the probable cost of obtain-
ing and treating, say 60 tons of Black Mangrove Bark per week, or 240 tons per month, and the
following figures have only been arrived at in accordance with the results of those inquiries, and
upon reports and estimates handed in by experts, also after making due provision for any in-
cidental expenses on a most liberal scale. Estimating that 240 tons of Bark will produce 40%
of Cutch, or say 108 tons of Cutch:—
108 tons of Cutch @ £2O per ton _ £2160
Cost of stripping and treating 240 tons of Bark to obtain 108 tons of Cutch per
month £1490
Net monthly profit £670
or £8,040 per annum, which shows over 15% on the Nominal Capital of the Company, and thus
within a reasonable time after the machinery is erected and in working order the Company
should then enter the dividend paying stage.
Mr. Harrison Russell assesses the probable per centage @ 58% ; thus it will be at once
seen in only estimating the bark to produce 45% of extract as above, a wide margin is allowed
for any variation.
PLANT. .
The Plant necessary for the Company’s business as a going concern, is estimated to cost
approximately £B,OOO when erected within the Company’s area, capable of treating upwards of
3,000 tons of bark per annum. Having a local factory, a great saving in freight will be ef-
fected, and the Bark will not be shipped until thoroughly dried, which is a most important factor.
In no instance, it is believed, has any attempt been made hitherto to manufacture the Cutch
locally. As regards the works to be erected, arrangements are being made for securing a
thoroughly up-to-date plant capable of extracting the Cutch in the most modern and economical
manner possible..

A MEDICINE OF REAL WORTH.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is intended for
acute throat and lung diseases, of which colds,
croup and whooping cough are the most common.
Those who have used it for years, and are in a
position to know its real value, assert; that it is
without an equal for the treatment of these
diseases. It not only cures colds and influenza,
but counteracts any tendency towards pneumonia.
It is in almost universal use as a preventive and
cure for croup, and has never been known to fp.il.*
ONLY REAL CURE
FOR INDIGESTION.
♦
Tonic Treatment to Strengthen
the Stomach*
This Man Found a Speedy and
Permanent Cure by this
Method.
There’s only one real cure for Indigestion. The
stomach must be made strong enough to digest
food without any trouble. Any other treatment
is mere patchwork at best. As the-processes of
digestion are controlled by the blood and the
nerves, the stomach that is too weak to properly
digest food needs a tonic to give it strength. We
have never heard of anything that has cured so
many cases of Indigestion as Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. This is because they make new blood, tone
the nerves, and so strengthen all the bodily
functions.
As proof is stronger than any argument, we
give below the particulars of the cure of Mr.
Charles H. Walton, general dealer, of Mitchell
Street, Bendigo, Vic., as taken down word for
word by a reporter :
“Some while ago I was sheep droving in
Queensland, and the rough life 1 had to lead
helped to bring on Indigestion,” said Mr. Walton.
“I suffered from belching of wind, water brash,
great fulness and pain about the heart, and great
difficulty in breathing, especially at night-time
when in bed. My tongue used to be very much
coated, and I had a horrible taste in my mouth,
I had a very poor appetite. Sometimes when I
would get out of bed I would feel so giddy I
Would have to catch hold of something to keep
myself from falling. My rest was always dis-
turbed. I could not get a night’s good sleep.
This was my state for four or five years, during
which time I tried many medicines, generally
costing seven shillings and sixpence a bottle, but
they did me no good. Then my aunt, Mrs. Clark,
of 172 Armstrong Street, Ballarat, advised me to
use Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, so I did. I did not
seem to find any benefit from the first box, I
think this was owing to taking other medicines at
the same time. I gave up the other medicines
and then found the pills doing me good. I kept
on using them until I had taken about eight boxes,
when I felt so much, improved that I felt quite a
different man.”
Bear in mind that it was Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills that cured Mr. Walton, not any of the
things said to lie just as good. They are 2s. 9d.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Evidently the Boy Scout is not a new
organisation. Ini. Kings, chapterxx., verse 27, it
is written concerning the fight with Benhadad
and bis Syrians: “And the children of Israel
pitched before them like two little flocks of
‘ kids.’ ”
On the second reading of the amending
Arbitration Bill in the House of Reps., a wild
Oppositionist squawk was raised that the pace
was being forced and debate suppressed. It was
an absurd howl. The Bill is an amending one
only, yet for its second reading it got half of
Wednesday, all of Friday, all of Tuesday, and all
of Wednesday—total, 31) days. Seven Ministeri-
alists and 16 Oppositionists talked. Now, com-
pare the second-reading debate on the principal
Act of 1904—an Act which, being new, justified
this sort of general discussion. Its record was:
March 22, Deakin’s speech ; April 13 and 14,
general debate ; total, 2£ days. Six Ministerial-
ists and seven Oppositionists spoke. When an
amending Bill gets more second-reading remarks
than the main Act itself got, any talk of “insuf-
ficient debate” is just so much loose yell—or pos-
sibly tight yell.
Again does the bottom fall out of the
Tory sensation. There was much excitement
recently over the revelation of a Tory dame, Mrs.
Barrington, to the effect that at last Federal
election a swagman in Riverina voted 20 times
(one account made it 27 times)—of course, for the
Labor candidate. The statement was made
quite positively, but it wasn’t meant to be
inquired into too closely, any more than
legal evidence was to be expected in
the matter of Jonah and the whale. But
the beastl.y Fisher Government started to
clamor at Mrs. Barrington’s door for particulars
so that it might prosecute the swagman, and then
the lady had to admit that she didn’t know the
swagman’s name, or exactly where the thing hap-
pened, or exactly how it happened. She was
simply “told of the incident by another person.”
Now the Department will presumably make fur-
ther disturbance at the Barrington door seeking
the name of “the other person.”
Certain parties who are still at large have
proposed that the question of religion should be
left out of the census return of 1911. It is diffi-
cult to imagine anything more alarming. Parsons
are, at all times, an excitable and argumentative
lot, given to vague imaginings of figures and
to a wild verdure of statistics. If there is no
census return for inquirers to fall back upon there
is no quieting influence with which to suppress
the visions of the reverend who declares that there
are now 827,000 Jesuits in the country, or the
other reverend who demands a
special grant for Salvationists
on the ground that they stand
for 4,327,193 of the population.
To leave out the religious ques-
tion would be to hand over the
community to chaos, and tumul-
tuous, bilious, unbounded curse.
An improvement might be
made, however, by altering
the form of the question. It
might, with advantage, be made
to read: “What church have
you been accustomed to attend
during the last three years?”
The reply in an immense pro-
portion of cases would be a dull
roar of “None.” Then the
people who so replied could be
put down as Practical Pagans,
and the community would get a
better view of itself in its religious
aspect. .
The Bulletin never had a very high
opinion of the “ Liberal ” party of N.S. VV., but
after reading the statements, published last week,
of certain eminent “Liberals ’’ who had failed to
get the nomination, it reckons that the Wade
crowd is much worse than anybody suspected.
By the accounts of some of its own supporters it
is capable of pretty well every political swindle
under the sun—roll-stuffing, ballot-faking, per-
sonation, forgery and all the rest. In fact, it has
just upset the selection of one of its own favorite
candidates—Watkins, of Waverley—on the ground
that the corruption was so vast as to invalidate
the entire proceedings. A party like that shouldn’t
be allowed out unless accompanied by a police-
man.
In its issue of August 5 the Sydney Tele-
graph reported two all-night sittings of Parlia-
ment —one in the Federal House and one in the
State Assembly. Regarding Wade’s case, the
paper said on its leader page :
Whatever the State Government may be charged with
by the Opposition, they will scarcely venture to accuse it
of wasting the last session of the expiring Parliament in
idle talk. The Caucus is being carried along the road of
legislative progress at a pace which seemsquite bewilder-
ing to Mr. McGowen and his colleagues.
In the next column was an agonised yell because
the Fisher Government kept the House out of
bed until 4 a.m. to pass the Amending Arbitra-
tion Bill. Said this singie-eyed publication :
The credit which was given to the Government of
retreating from the unjustifiable attempts fo force its
Bills through Parliament, without giving the Opposition
an effective opportunity of discussing them, was proved
by the proceedings on the Arbitration Bill to have been
premature. The Government, with the authority of the
Caucus —with, indeed, the command of the Caucus-
compelled the House of Representatives to sit till after
four this morning to debate the Bill on its second read-
ing. . . . The House lias not had a fair chance of ade-
quately dealing with the measure.
So that an enforced long sitting by Mr. Wade is a
sweep “ along the road of legislative progress,”
but in the case of Mr. Fisher it is “an unjustifi-
able attempt to force Bills through Parliament.”

“ Increment ” remarks
Apparentlj', by way of a pre-election dodge, and in a
desperate attempt to obtain the civil servants’ vote for
Wade( theN.S. W. Public Service Board has framed new
regulat ions concerning increments in the clerical division
of the Service. For years it has been the Board’s prin-
ciple that automatic increases shall cease at £l5O, and
Herculean and other efforts to shift the principle up a
bit have failed. Now, however, the Board has gone
of its own accord to the £lBO mark, and the in-
ference is that somebody oiled the wheels of the
machine. Anyhow, it doesn’t matter much, as the
Board intimates that all hands will now have to
stand at £l5O for two years, then go on to £165
and mark time there for two more years, and then
leap to £lBO, at which point the leaper can stand easy until
luck or another Government with a desperate desire for
his vote makes a fresh proposition. It works out that
the average public servant will start at £5O, work up to
£BO, £95, £llO, £125, £l4O, £l5O (two years), t 165 (two
years), and £lBO (at 27 years of age), which is an invita-
tion to only the mediocre. Even as it is now the position
of the average public servant of 10 years’ standing is
inferior to that of the capable bricklayer, who can
demand 14s. a day and get.it.

The Tarrant Motor Co. naturally desires to
mention that it is not one of the “certain” motor-car
importers and agemswho are said to be under inquiry
by the Minister of Customs. Here is one of the eternal
cases where a Press reference to “certain” firms in a
certain trade is very unfair to traders in the same line
who are not implicated in the mysterious business.
Robert Best, pride and joy of the political
mothers’ unions and the national association of
aunts, drifts to his suitable position as the chosen
of the Victorian Tories for the intensely conserv-
ative constituency which Knox was forced to
abandon. There was a time when the Knox fol-
lowing would not have looked at Robert, but now
they make the Best of a bad job, and the motto
in the Argus office is “He prayeth best who
loveth Best.” In this way the old Liberals ad-
vance like crabs.
A PROMISING PREMIER.
Mr. Wade has given several promises to afford a means
of redress for clerks during this session.

PRE,OER WADE: “ Just give ’em a handful of
these promises to keep 'em quiet till after the

Recently one of Tait’s Vic. trains was held
up at a wayside station because the engine was
stricken with sudden paralysis. Relief was im-
mediately summoned from the nearest town, and,
when a fresh engine arrived to continue the
journey, 84 minutes had been eaten in a tiresome
delay. Still, the train reached its destination
right on time. It had covered its journey in 84
minutes less than the period laid down in the
time-table, and thus it re-discovered the lost art of
motion on the Victorian railways.
The noise of Tory gentlemen over the pro-
posed Australian Note Issue is becoming an
offence to a rational community. A day or so.ago,
Mcßryde, chairman of the Commercial Bank,
said :
It was much to be regretted that, in face of the
disastrous experience of similar issues in other countries,
the Government should needlessly venture upon the
disastrous expedient of a State note issue.
Seemingly, Mcßryde has not heard that Queens-
land—to take only one case—has had a State note
issue for years, and has not experienced any
“disastrous” results. But perhaps Mcßryde is
not aware that there is a State called Queensland.
From London Daily Mail (25/6/’10) :
Invitations to British and Canadian firms to tender for
the new warships will be issued shortly. They will con-
tain a definite provision that the vessels must be built in
Canada. Messrs. Vickers, Sons and Maxim, who are to
establish a plant at Montreal, will probably compete.
In Australia, the suggestion that a provision be
made insisting that Australian war-vessels should
be constructed locally was howled down by the
dreadful Foreign-trade gang as (1) “disloyal,”
(2) ridiculous—the idea being that such craft
couldn’t possibly be built in these allegedly
uncivilised regions. Canada, displaying the
wisdom that Australia lacks, has not only
legislated to bring a quantity of work and
wages to its own people in connection with the
construction of its battleships, but has incidentally
attracted to its shores a branch of an immense in-
dustry which must give employment to Canadians
in countless other directions. Come to think of
it, Australia always has been behind Canada on
the naval question. Canada never paid an annual
subsidy for a squadron, admittedly useless as a
fighting force, however valuable it might be at
balls, race meetings and so forth, and it never
tried to force Dreadnoughts on people who didn’t
want them.
“ William Torpedo ’’ writes of battleships
and eggs
I see that Brazil has ordered a battleship to cost
£2.900,000, that will be able to play big brother to the
various herds of £2,000,000 Dreadnoughts and Dread-
nought cruisers built by the various PoVvers since 1905.
I also see that Great Britain, during 1909, imported
about 275,000,000 eggs from Russia, the British hen
having apparently been driven out of business by the
stress of foreign competition. To get these eggs across
unbroken to bis breakfast-table, Bull has in commission
or on order about 20 of the u'eaker £2,000,000 battleships,
as well as the tail of the Fleet which begins with the
King Edward class of ship, and dwindles with terrible
rapidity to things like pie Powerful, and worse. In
theory, at least, all these kettles of the sea will be back
numbers as soon as the Brazilian giant is afloat; and the
protection afforded the Russian egg by their 12in. guns
will be reduced to something like a grim jest by the 14in.
horrors of the new ship. This immense upward leap in the
price of battleships means more and more agony for Bull,
who has to shepherd each egg and frozen sheep and bushel
of wheat with a floating mountain of steel, and found it
the very devil of a job to do it and keep solvent even
when mountains were only £2,000,000 each. The Sydney
Telegraph arose one morning lately and crowed some-
what hoarsely in a sub-leader about “ the rising tide of
British trade.” The information about the rising tide in
the price of battleships was printed on the cable page
opposite ; but it was not referred to by the leader writer.
Seeing that British trade consists largely of doing such
absurd things as dragging fragile hen-fruit across the deep,
and that the hen-harvest has to be guarded with heavy-
weight fighting vessels, the intelligence was worth cram-
ming in somewhere. If the price of battleships keeps on
rising some desperate British taxpayer will yet be reduced
to sowing wheat on the croquet lawn, putting cattle on the
local golf links, and giving the local hen a leg-up into the
nest.
The Victorian Premier lately had a chance
to say something different from “ The time is not
ripe.” He was asked to make the franchise equal
for the two Houses, which would be a good, brisk
trot on the way to constitutional reform. But
Murray preferred to doze; and if he didn’t sav
‘ The time is not yet ripe,” he said words to the
same effect—he only promised to give the matter
attention “before Parliament ended.” Which
phrase is first cousin to “ soon,” and full brother
to “never.”
A Chow fruiterer, of Benalla (Vic.), has
been convicted of the crime of offering £5O to a
Customs officer to pass a contraband Chow
named Fo Sue. It seemed that the money came
from Fo Sue’s father, who wanted to get his
offspring into the Commonwealth, and had asked
his brother (the would-be briber) to work the
oracle. It might be well to raise a question as to
how an evidently unsophisticated Chow came to
suppose that he could pass Fo Sue through the
Customs, as though he were a parcel of opium, by
tempting one official after another with a bundle
of notes. The prisoner in this case is suffering
for his belief in the dishonesty of the Common-
wealth’s revenue protectors.
S. Aus. is singing its annual hallelujah
over its vital statistics. Last year, although it
had 40 extra deaths by reason of a wreck, its total
was 50 less than in 1908. For the last five years
its death-rate is 9‘83 per 1000, while all the other
States show between 10 and 12 per 1000. Last
year’s alone was 9'28, the lowest on record. There
were 3275 weddings; the rate was the highest
since 1884. and the total easily a record. It is
characteristic of S.A. that the Methodists had
a third of the marrying to do. Anglicans
and Romans between them did another third,
and various sects the rest. The unreligious
registrar only got a handful—l3s. The birth-rate
still stayed comparatively low —the lowest in the
Commonwealth, that of Victoria only excepted
But S.A. takes care of what young citizens it does
get. It has cut down its rate of deaths under one
year old by a half during this century, and now
declares the record rate of only 6'12 per 100.
Altogether, the excess of births over deaths was
0282, the best gain for 14 years.

A forcible speech was delivered by Mr. J. Havelock
Wilson, general secretary of the National Seamen’s
Union, at a meeting of seamen at Poplar (England) on
Sunday. The speaker said that he must tell the Govern-

Chinese in South Africa, and yet allow Chinese to he

taken in South Africa, hut Chinese colonies were being
founded in the chief ports of Great Britain.— Cable.

22 CALIBER CARTRIDGES
Different makes of cartridges look very much alike, but
you don’t buy cartridges for looks. What you want
is efficiency. That’s why you should buy Winchester
Cartridges. Winchester .22 Caliber Cartridges, Short,
Long and Long Rifle, either black or smokeless powder,
are loaded by automatic machinery, which insures their
always being sure fire and of full strength, which means
accuracy and power. The smokeless cartridges are loaded
with Winchester Greaseless bullets, which are clean to
handle and prevent loss of powder strength. It is easy to
be a penny wise and a pound foolish in buying cartridges.

Brunswick, Melbourne, states:—“As our children
had been troubled with worms for some time,
being restless and peevish, their sleep much dis-
turbed, and their appetite variable, my husband
persuaded me to procure some Comstock’s ‘Dead
Shot’ Worm Pellets. We followed the directions
and were pleased, indeed, to find that the pellets
had the desired effect, expelling a vast number of
thread worms. Both my little girl and boy were
greatly relieved, and have since shown no return
of the symptoms. We recommend Comstock's
‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets to parents whose
children are similarly affected.”

NOTIONS
(i The friends and admirers of .Dailey Messenger.
“ the Incomparable,” are anxious, as that often injured
lejr is giving the great Sydney 'bailer some trouble. He
returned last week from Brisbane to lead the local
Leaguers against the English invaders, and was unable
to play. On that day of disaster Australia missed him
badly.
For the last match against the English in Syd-
ney ended in a rout, a debacle, a blanky smash. Fresh-
ened up by a stay in Maoriland’s bracing climate, rested
with the double sea trip, the Anglo-Welshmen re-
turn«l to Sydney to find the boiler-metal team, that
had disputed things so evenly with them aforetime
away in Brisbane, knocking the stuffing out of Queens-
land. And in its absence the invaders caught NSW
even as the Danes caught Ethelred the Unready, and
x 7o r !£ rew . I . t> an(i fe]l upon iu During the first half
N.S.W., with the aid of the wind, kept its tail up fairlv
"'ell ; the whistle sounded for half-time with England in
the van, by a modest 12 to seven. But in the second
half, with the energetic breeze behind it, the English
team began to move with fearful velocity. Its
passing was magnificent, and its hand work superb
the ball being taken like lightning when travel-
ling at full speed. The English forwards pushed
the home men about as they pleased in the
scrums and beat them flat in the open. They
also harried the local backs and broke up almost every
passing charge before it could be got going. Lomas was
a juggernaut w'hen he wanted to be one, and when he
didn’t want to jugg he could be as light as a feather and
as mild as a dewdrop on a lion’s nose. His kicking was
a hideous thing for the Australians to see.
knows how many goals he landed ; to human beings thev
grew monotonous. But all things come to an end, and
even that Saturday afternoon wore out at last, leaving
N.S. W. knocked endways by 50 points to 12.
This is a record in international struggles as far
as Australia is concerned. But the visitors’ tour has
been phenomenally successful. Of 18 matches played in
Australia and Maoriland the English team lost oniy four
—two to N.S.W., one to the Kangaroos and one to Aus-
tralasia. One with Australasia was drawn. England scored
527 points, and had only 25)4 scored against it. N.S.W.
can find some slight grain of comfort as it sits among the
debris in the reflection that Maoriland had a bigger score
made against it. But, on second thoughts, that consola-
tion is snatched away by the fact that the margin
between the scores was in Maoriland’s favor. Maoriland
was beaten by 52 to 20, and the Maoris of Rotorua made
18 to the English 54. So there isn’t much joy anywhere.
While the Englishmen were stamping on N. S.
Wales at Sydney, the Ma State’s XIII. were dealing it out
to a Queensland League crowd at Woolloongabba, outside
Brisbane. Queensland forwards were fast—very fast, in-
deed ; but the invading backs were almost perfect.
Their combination was magnificent, and every man of
them was a giant in his own sphere. The Queensland
case was hopeless from the start, in spite of the
fast pack. When the N.S.W. machine got properly
going there was a magnificent struggle, and though
the Queensland pack harried them badly and broke up
their formation repeatedly, the N.S.W.‘backs managed
to get across again and again, and won out with 19 points
to three. The team that went to Brisbane should have
been kept at home to battle with the English. The
Northern campaign could easily have been' left to a
weaker force.
* * * *
In the Union competitions around Sydney
Newtown still maintains its lead with 18 points to the 14
held by University, Glebe and South Sydney. Eastern
Suburbs has 12, and below that six clubs climb
wearily on the single figure stage. It was
the misfortune of Eastern Suburbs on Saturday
to be the block on which Newtown chopped out its sur-
plus points. And it stood not on the order of its chon-
ping, but made the points fly to the tune of 21 to three.
Which is a terrible thing in a Union game. None of the
Saturday matches were interesting for the simple reason
that the draw had thrown a weak club against a strong
one in every case. One-sided conflicts do not appeal to
popular fancy. Still Western Suburbs put up an unex-
pected struggle against South Sydney, which just man-
aged to win through with 14 points against nine. St. George,
which has never been an over-bright combination, aston-
ished itself and the natives by downing Svdney by 20 to nil.
Everybody knew Sydney was more or less dead, but no
one dreamed it was so dead as this. Manly had a bad
time too, at the feet of University; the hard-kicking
Students winning by 19 points to three. Balmain jour-
neyed to North Sydney and wished it had stayed at
home, for the wild hillmen of the North came out in
their strength and kicked up 19 points to Balmain’s six.
* * * *
“ Strang! Strang ! Strang ! ” howled the Aus-
tralian Rules crowd at Erskineville Oval on Saturday
afternoon as the Paddington heathens downed the Holy
Ones of Y.M.C.A. For Strang was the life and soul of
the Paddington attack, and on the day’s performance the
old player with the almost useless leg was one of the
makers of destiny. With the five goals he kicked (one
from 68.yds.) he placed Paddington in the semi-final
tussle and heaved Newtown right out of all chance of ap-
propriating the Rawson Cup. No wonder they cheered
him—all excepting Newtown, that is, of course. In spite
of his game leg he is still the best kick in the Aus-
tralian Rules League to-day. In Melbourne in 1905
he was one of Skinner’s hirelings, and put up the
record for the year with 61 goals in 14 matches.
Rumor had it that the Holy Ones were “stiff’’for the
occasion so as to biff Newtown out of the concluding
struggle ; but there was no suggestion of the fact in their
play. But, notwithstanding, a deputation waited on the
Y.M.C.A. secretary and asked him was his club stiff. His
answer was vitriolic, and at latest reports the deputation
had made good its escape with the loss of its hat and
clothes. In the semi-finals Y.M.C.A. will now play
Sydney, and Paddington will wrestle with East Sydney,
and the victors will maul each other at a later date. The
Geelong team was to arrive in Sydney after this issue had
gone to press, and the Fitzroy team is due there to-day
(Thursday), and is to play N.S.W. oh Saturday. I n fact,
the Ma State will have two A.R. teams in the field on
Saturday, as it has to play both Geelong and Fitzroy—a
job which seems past its strength.
* * * *
In Sydney Soccer circles excitement is at fever
heat. Glebe and Rozelle are running neck and neck in
the Rawson Cup struggle with 14 competition points
each, and the Powerful crew has irrupted into a leading’
position in the Gardiner Cup, which carries the State
championship. It did this by means of a code of signals
by which the skipper controls the actions of every man in
the XI. St. George got the benefit of it on Saturday,
and went down smash, the figures being six goals to one.
The Saints put up a great game, but that concerted
effort overwhelmed them. The other branch of the
naval sports did not come off so well; up against Ultimo
the mechanics and artificers of Garden Island had practi-
cally no hope, and were crushed by four to nil. In the
Rawson Cup competition, Balmain and Rozelle played a
scoreless draw, and Glebe downed Sydney after a
rackety game by four goals to two.
Of the three League matches in Melbourne on
Saturday one didn’t count, another was a catastrophe,
and only the third, between the old rivals,- ’Wood ai d
’Roy, justified its “gate.” ’Roy has no “possible” m
the competition, but it had run Carlton to three points
the week before, and if it outed ’Wood the latter’s chance
of reaching the final four wouldn’t be worth considering.
The Maroons went off with a rush and scored two goals.
The Magpies got their machine going and passed
along time and again to the most reliable goal-getter in
the League, but somehow he couldn’t kick straight.
’Roy, with less to say in the argument and fewer
shots to its credit, was six points ahead at half-time
(37 to 31); but in the second half the Magpies arranged
that, if they could manage only occasional goals, the
others should get only behinds and few of them. When
the bell rang it was,’Roy 42, ’Wood 54. The concluding
stages were willing ; two ’Woodmen and a ’Roy had to be
carried off to the doctor. On South’s ground the locals
were fighting for “semi-final” existence against Gee-
long. Defeat meant disaster to either party, conse-
quently there was hardly tip-toe room for the
late-comers —up to half-time. By then South had
shown such superiority that ordinary spectators
faded away to find something worth looking at. Geelong
played decently earlier in the season ; but to-day it is
barely third-class. When the rout ended Skinner’s hire-
lings had 78 points, Geelong but 26. The Richmond v.
Saints episode, with no incentive to violent bogging-in,
ended in a curt remark by the scorer that the former
had scored 54 points, the latter 16. As things are. South,
’Varsity and ’Wood are still scuffling for third and fourth
places, and it doesn’t appear as though the argument
would be settled till the two latter meet on August 27.
■*•**»
Of the Melbourne Ass. disturbances only the
P’ran-’Town ruction counted, and by outing ’Town by 69
to 55 the shopkeeping suburb practically made good its
entry into the “final four.” The game was strenuous;
no points were wasted and few given away. Atlemon-time
the board remarked, “48 all”; but P’ran lasted out the
better and scored 3tol in that last spell. At 3 p.m.
’Scray possessed an outside chance in the competition,
but when Brunswick had finished with it at 5 p.m., that
chance had gone. Scores: ’Wick, 127; ’Scray, 61.
North 92 v. Brighton 36; Port 92 v. ’Cote 57; and
Essendon 137 v. Preston 21 were the results of the other
uproars, but only hopelessly obsessed barrackers troubled
to consider them.
* * * *
During the week sundry honorariums handed
out well-deserved penalties to obstreperous barrackers.
One damsel, who had rebuked a victorious bogger-in
with her umbrella, sustained a broken brolly and a 20s.
fine, while sundry male “ supporters ” were from £1 to
£5 poorer after the J.P. had put his spoke in. Also, the
N. E. Ass. handed out fines of £1 and £2 to various argu-
mentative players. The Port club decided to retire
several players in consequence of vague but extensive
doubts as to the genuineness of their doings. Also, the
League dropped on a St. Hilda player with a sentence of
disqualification for the rest of the season, and on a Carl-
ton star with one till August, 1911. This latter
penalty carries a quaint consequence, inasmuch as
the ’bailer is also Carlton’s secretary, and, by his
suspension, loses his office. Now, the Carlton
club has a rule that where the secretary Ceases to hold
office the candidate next highest at the elections shall
take the position ; and as that candidate was Johnny
Worrall, the main cause of the recent disruption of the club,
there is violent argument as to what should be done.
Nobody, however, need be alarmed, as Worrall wouldn’t
at present touch that billet with a 40ft. pole. He has a
much softer snap. The League also decided to ponder
further over the proposed “ out-of-bounds ” innovations,
but accepted the reform that in future the umpire shall
bounce the ball inside a sft.-circle instead of in the
middle of things generally. But what the umpire really
wants is to bounce the air-bag from a 50ft. iron cage.
And even then he wouldn't feel too secure.

The East Brisbane Harrier team that did so
badly in the Five Miles Cross Country Championship
returned to its regular haunts last Saturday complaining
that the Sydney men were far from affable. The Sydney
men were affable enough ; but the trouble was that the
East Brisbane team contained a sprinkling of hoodlums
who disgraced the club, and with whom local running
men declined to be seen. This hoodlum section was liable
to explode into loud howls anywhere and everywhere ;
and did it occasionally at the dining table, in the’
tram car and elsewhere. Also, it ogled women and
pavyed maids. Apparently it couldn’t carry liquor, and
used to get howling "drunk on two' cigarettes and the
odor of half a pub. The night before it left for home it
howled its wav into the boarding-house, and was only
quietened by the threat of the angry hostess to ring for
the police. It is up to East Brisbane Club to hold an
inquiry and give the decent members of the team a cer-
tificate of character, and biff the others out.
The fact that two 10-mile races are set down for
the 20th and 27th of this month makes one
ponder. It is doubtful if these long runs are beneficial
to the community; the chances are that more men are
strained and rendered permanently weak than made
strong and tough. A sport that renders its votaries old
before their time owing to excessive strain is worse than
a vice, because it is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. And that,
in the opinion of writer, is what events like five- and ten-
miles cross country races do. There is always some fool
loose who insists on making the pace swift from the
start, and if one sets the tune the others have to run to it.

Melbourne ’Varsity athlete Frank Kerr cleaned
up the five-miles cross-country championsip of Victoria
at Ballarat last Saturday afternoon. He defeated a big
field vvhich included all the top-notchers with the excep-
tion of Geo. Blake. Kerr cut out the journey in 28min.
11 l-ssec., which licks the previous best for the race com-
piled by Aleck Stillwell in 1901. That versatile ped did
the journey in 28min. 44see. However, comparisons in
the matter of clock recordings would be unfair to the
champions of former years, because the Ballarat weather
is fickle and the course is ofttimes no better than
a gluepot interspersed with barbed-wire fences.
Writer has been there on several occasions, and
knows its icy winds and heavv going onlv too well
Kerr used splendid judgment. He allowed Richardson"
the Ballarat harrier, to do the donkey work, and then at
the opportune moment came away atid won nicely from
him and Turnbull, a very promising East Melbourne pro-
duct. Victor Aitken, the 10-miles champ ; on, who goes
better when the mileage is longer, ran into fourth posi-
tion. Kerr is no surprise-packet to this scribe, because
on his training runs he looked a sure winner. The 10-
miles C.C.O. of Victoria occurs next month, and the
writer places Kerr at the top of the field, with Aitken
not far down. Kerr is an easy-moving ped., with a happy
knack of lengthening his stride at a finish.
* * * *
After all, the charge of professionalism hurled
against the N.S.W. Rugby League footballers is a verv
hollow and unconvincing thing. The terms on which the
players went to Brisbane leaked out the other day, and it
transpired that these money-grubbing “professionals”
received 10s. per day for loss of time, 7s. 6d. for pocket
money, and all board and travelling expenses paid. Of
course, compared to the Union scale it is magnificent *
but does anyone seriously suppose that ayouth with any-
thing at all in him is going to devote himself wholly
solely and exclusively to toe-balling for the sake of mak-
ing small hauls like these three or four times in a vear?
Mice ! Or, as Chief-Secretary Wood might remark, “ Pi«-s’
feet! ”
At uist! For years the English road cyclists
have been bursting their boilers to cut out the 100 un-
paced miles in five hours. Word conies that Leon Mere-
dith, the English amateur long-distance champion,
waltzed over a 50-mile stretch of the Rath-road in two
directions in 4h. 52min. 51 4-ssec. Meredith is a wonder.
For years he has been practically invincible, and holds
no less than five world’s records to his own cheek. The
news has moved the big Dunlop Rubber Co. to offer a
prize of £2O to the first Australasian rider who can better
Meredith’s time over an out-and-home course. As a 50-
mile decent course is unobtainable outside the Western
District of Victoria, Australian riders will be allowed to
use a 25-mile course.

For a fine tussle the road-cycling for the Dun-
lop Shield in the N.S.W. Inter-Club Amateur Premier-
ship would be hard to beat. The race dates back to 1902,
and the old hands say the struggle this year was the
daddy' of them all. The teams that qualified for the
final were Marrickville and Redfern, each club being
represented by five riders. Marrickville won with first,
second, sixth and seventh places against Redfern’s third,
fourth, fifth and eighth. The distance between the
riders was only a matter of a few feet when they passed
the judge. Single pace was provided by other amateur
riders, and someone made it swift, the first 10 miles being
covered in 25min. 25sec., the 20 miles were thrown be-
hind in 51min. 7sec., and the 30 miles in lhr. 17min.
22 3-ssec.

The idea of a motor cycle reliability race be-
tween Melbourne and Sydney has caught on immensely,
and 14 Sydney men and about the same number of Mel-
bourne motor-cyclists have signified their intention to
compete. The race will probably eventuate in October
and be spread over four days, and the conditions will call
for an average speed of 21 miles an hour. But of this
affair more anon.
* * *
Evidently bike road racing is booming in Vic-
toria, where the “Cycle Traders’ 100 Miles’ Race”
has drawn over 300 entries. Last year the big Dunlop
Warrnambool drew 548 entries, and this year’s rush pro-
mises to be equally' large, if not larger. Cyclists, by the
way, should remember that entries for the Warrnambool
close with the Dunlop Co. on Friday, September 2.
Away back in 1898, C. R. Donning, on a Dunlop-
shod bike, ran over the 1930 miles between Perth and
Adelaide in 28 days Bhr. 50min. Since then various
cyclists have done the trip, but none have managed to
lower Donning’s time. And every cyclist that has tra-
versed the sandy weariness has declared that no
motor-car could ever get across it. But H. Corpe, a
S. Australian motorist who mixes daredevilism
with unexpected caution, is going to make an
effort to burst through from Adelaide to Perth
via Port Augusta, Eucla, Dundas and Kalgoorlie.
The worst part of the trip is the horror known
as “Eyre’s Patch,” a nasty stretch on which it is
almost certain that twin tyres and strips of matting will
have to be used. Cope is not down-hearted at the hostile
reports, and replies to all objections that the Port
Darwin trip was said to be absolutely impossible till
Aunger and Dutton did it; after which it was declared
as easy as having a log dropped on you.
To-day (Thursday) week, Arnst and Barry will
row for the championship of the world and £5OO a-side.
Arnst, cabling to Sydney friends, declares that Barry is
not up to championship form, and that the order of the
surname initials will be that of the- race. He also adds
the information that they have signed to row
under “ World Championship Rules ” instead of
“Thames Rules,” as originally arranged. It seems
that the British South Africa Co. has also slung
a purse of £5OO on to the table to swell the
profits of the winner. So far, Arnst has received
about £3OO for expenses, although it is understood that
only £250 vvill be allowed the loser ori that score. The
river is 300yds. wide where the course is situated, and
men have been kept busy shooting off the hippo, that are
domiciled in the reach. Seems that the hippo, always
clear out when they discover that a place has become
suddenly unhealthy ; so it was reckoned that a little
judicious killing daily would cause them to abandon the
whole reach of water wanted by the Lord of Creation to
decide which of him is top dog.
The Australian Rowing Association is at pre-
sent worrying over a proposal to despatch an eight-oar
crew to South Africa in August, 1911, to boast up a pro-
jected world’s regatta on the Zambesi. The estimated
cost of the picnic is put down at ) 850 ; and, as the State
Association finds it hard to keep its financial head above
water-line, the proposal is a nightmare. Australia’s part
in the regatta, therefore, hasn’t a very promising out-
look.

The Maxfield Shield, a mid-winter bowling
trophy which keeps the Sydney old ’unsfrom dozing too
heavily, was the bone of contention on Saturday. Out
of the tangle, Parramatta(which.defeated Redfern by 70
points)climbed on top, so it will hold the “Cup” for 12
months. A sad feature of the afternoon’s bowling was
the failure of genial Bob Luck b un, of Manly, who, op-
posed to a Waverley rink, well-nigh created a record by
going down to the tune of 50 points to four. It was a
mighty rout; but Luckham smiled joyously, and was
the least concerned man about the premises.

“Charlie” Wevman is the T.M.S. of amateur
athletics. For the last four years he has filled second
place in the N.S.W. cross-country championship, and he
also ran into second place in last vear’s Queensland
cross-country event. Another record-holder in the
cross-country athletic world is Dick Coombes, who has
filled an official position in every season’s event since 1890.
Maoriland has dug out another crank who is
threatening to break new records in an old way. In the
hope of finding a cure for dyspepsia, a resident of Gore
township went on short rations for 52 days, his sole daily
nourishment being a cup of hot milk and a toothful of
essence of fruit. Out of the experiment, the fasting
man emerged somewhat improved in health, and the
foolishness is going to be repeated with an eye on records
and other things.

Many of the games in every billiard tournament
are cautions to long odds layers, but one of the heats in
the Victorian Club (Melbourne) tournament last week
was almost a record. Beauchamp, one of the very best
of the local amateurs, was on the “60 behind” mark,
whilst his opponent had a start of 120 in the game of 250
up. The “ mug” appeared to have no chance, and when
the “crack” had overhauled him ’ere he got to the
second century, there were offers of 100 to'l, 150 to 1,
and even 200 to 1 against him. But the beaten man
plodded on and the “crack” lost his confidence, and
they were stuck at “ 248 all ” when he—the “ crack ”
was reduced to the necessity of playing a safety stroke on-
his opponent’s ball. He couldn’t even attempt to score,,
but was content to leave the other fellow a bare ano
dangerous chance of getting the two points. The
attempt failed, and theb the tactician went out. Mean-
while the odds of 200 to 1 on had come down to even*
money, and this without either man having done any-
thing remarkable to account for the altered aspect of
affairs.

Arthur Tricks, who is now quite a veteran
among Melbourne cueists, won the Vic. amateur billiard
championship last week, for the third year in succession ;
wherefore Alcock’s silver cup passed into his possession
for good. Tricks has been the pluckiest and most con-
sistent of the Vic. amateurs ever since championship
tournaments were introduced by the Alcock firm. He
plays with a good style and a wise head, and this year,
being called upon as champion to beat the three survivors
of the challengers, instead of the one best as in previous
contests, he licked them all. A few breaks of over 100
were made during the struggle, and both in hazard
striking and in safety tactics the best men showed im-
provement on former exhibitions.

Gordon Inglis : Australians and Maorilanders
rolled up in force to see the boys from home —our home
—carry their tennis rackets to more victories at Wimble-
don (England) recently. Wilding, partnered by Ritchie,
had an easier time in the doubles than he experienced
against Gore in the singles. In the doubles, both Gore
and his associate, Roper Barrett, were colorless; and
Wilding and Ritchie made it a cakewalk. In the mixed
doubles, S. N. Doust and Mrs. Lambert Cham-
bers were not pressed hard. The lady is the pos-
sessor of a forehand drive that would be a big asset to
many prominent male players ; and Doust was right up
to the top rung of his form. The Sydneyite has greatly
improved his game since he left the Harbor City, and his
fleetness of foot combined with brilliant volleying, makes
him about the best “ mixed ” player in the tennis world
at the present time.
“ One Bottle Bill ” : Seldom has an athlete had
a bigger strain put on his nerves than had Maorilander
Wilding during the recent finals for the tennis champion-
ship of England (practically the world’s championship),
at Wimbledon. Prior to the deciding matches he got
mixed up in a collision with his motor cycle, and some
unpleasantness followed as to the licensing of bis machine..
As a result, a John Hop was despatched to the tennis
courts to make a mental photograph of Wilding,
and throughout the latter’s hat'd fight with Beals
Wright, the Law bored holes in him from a pro-
minent position with an outraged optic. Wilding
won, but it wasn’t the fault of the J. Dunn that the
Staring Optic didn’t throw the visitor off his game. I
kept close to the Law with a lemonade bottle, and at
the first sign of nervousness on the part of Wilding, I pro-
posed to land it on the Law’s crown in the most ap-
proved Surry Hills manner. But Wilding didn’t shake
once—not even when he was subsequently fined 12s. Bd,
by the local magistrate.

The £lOOO hurdle race at Caulfield last Satur-
day was captured by Tundulya, one of the bottom
weights, who was quoted at only 12 to 1, though there
were five better favorites. Another joyful event for the
“ books ” ! In a field of 13 Tundulya ran last for a long
way, apparently out-paced, but at the business end of
the 3 i miles journey he had more go than the rest of
them, and won by sheer stamina. Another of the 9-stone
lot finished third, and King’s Ransom, placed fourth,
carried less than 10st., so the handicapping system
looked wrong, as usual. If the top weights in big
hurdle races are never to have a chance, there is no in-
ducement to run the horses that have exposed their
“ form.” The object, seemingly, is to prevent the good
ones from profiting by their goodness after it has been
fairly proved, which, considering that there are no
w.f.a. races for jumpers, is rather destructive of public
interest in the game. The Steeplechase next Saturday
will give some of the starters their last opportunity to
get killed before the summer sets in.

Whitmore Carr (always known as “Doctor”
for some forgotten reason) has been re-elected chairman
of the Adelaide Racing Club. He was for years sporting
editor of the Rhoistkr, and has since been president of
the Adelaide Stock Exchange. At the A.R.C. annual meet-
ing he pointed out how cheap racing in S.A. is to owners.
The Adelaide Oup, or Birthday Gup, carries a stake
of £l3OO, and costs to start £lO, while the Toorak Handi-
cap at Caulfield, with a stake of £l2OO, costs £22. Other
comparisons work out the same way. This is, of course,
due to S.A.’s having the totalisator. The club’s commis-
sion out of the machine (provided and not missed by the
public) enables it to treat owners liberally.

The Dunlop Rubber Co. desires to remind gen-
tlemen intending to compete in this year’s “ Warrnam-
bool,” which is now definitely set down for October 1,
that the co.’s special nomination forms must be used.
These forms may be obtained from any Dunlop depot.
The “ Warrnambool ’’promises to be as big as ever, and
a considerable number of entries are already in hand.
The prize list totals £209.*

Seems that the South African cricketers will
not come after all. Only the Board’s guarantee of £5000"
will satisfy their hunger for a sure t hing, arid the Sydney
Sun’s lavish offer to “put up the stuff” sways them not-
at all. Evidently the gentle Boer is a bit thick in the-
top-piece. Probably he will be glad enough to conic-
later on, but this is probably the last chance he vvilli
have, for, by the look of things, cricket is a dying game.
TOO MUCH JOHNSON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jack Johnson has bought another mansion. The
house which the champion has acquired was formerly in
the occupation of Mr. Behr, the millionaire, and £20,000
is the price he is said to have paid for it. The elite on
Brooklyn Heights are not in raptures over the prospect
of Johnson’s advent among them. They are making a
great outers’. —Cable item.
Johnson on my nerves has got,
He’s an all-pervading figure,
Ev’ry day comes news red-hot,
More about the blighted nigger—
“ Johnson now,” so runs the cable,
“ Has ten motors in his stable ” !
Johnson, morning, noon and night 1
Of the world he stops the traffic 1
Taking all the darned limelight,
In despatches telegraphic—
“ Johnson has just sent another
Million dollars to his mother” l
But the late.,t wire to hand
Is enough to rouse a nation I
Near the richest of the land
He has taken up his station :
“ Johnson’s needs still show expansion—
He has bought another mansion 1 "
It’s no wonder the 61ite
(See the trade-mark on the label!)
Though they kick, confess they're beat;
Meanwhile we expect this cable :
“ Washington full of reporters.
White House Johnson's training quarters.”

The Advantages of Motor=Bicycling.
gh
There are many advantages to be derived from owning: a good motor-bicycle.
First of all, it is one of the cheapest forms of locomotion you can get.
Mr. Selby, the representative of the Dunlop Rubber 00. Ltd., Sydney, ran his
Triumph Motor for 3000 miles, and the total expense—including spirit, oil
and minor expenses—was £3 3s. net.
This is at the rate of one farthing a mile. And while you may know a friend
with a more expensive motor-bicycle to run it’s pretty sure not be a
Triumph. Ask us for catalogue of these fine machines.

Removal

Super-

Hair.
gh
A Lady Will Give You Her Secret Free.
For years I have searched for a simple and
satisfactory way to remove superfluous hair from
the skin so that it would not return. Experi-
ments proved to me that the pastes,
powders, depilatories, electrical appliances, etc.,
now on the market were often injurious, and not
lasting in their effects. At last I discovered a
plan which succeeded in producing marvellous,
permanent results where all others failed. A
fashionable Parisian lady who followed my advice
says : “My face is now soft and smooth, and no
one would ever think it had been disfigured by
a growth of superfluous hair.” Others write : “It
seems too good to be true.” Well, the test will
tell. No matter hovv much or how little super-
fluous hair is on your face, neck, arms or body, I
am confident that you can now remove it, per-
manently, and with perfect safety. I will send
full information regarding the secret of my dis-
covery absolutely free to every woman who writes
at once, but this offer is limited to a short time
only, so do not delay if you wish to benefit
FREE. Address KATHRYN B. FIRMIN

MARVEL STITCHER is a patented invention that
simplifies the setrine of leather, rubber, canvas and
similar heavy materials. The engraving shows three
ways in which it is valuable to farmers ami horse
owners. You can repair a horse collar with it better than
most saddlers. The Stitcher will new a rip tinder the hames
with heavy nine-cord waxed threat! or with wire, and make a
secure job with a perfect lock-stitch, or with a chain-stitch as
firm as rivets. You can sew on a strap, taking ihe stitches
right through the collar, and you can, in a coup e of minutes,
form a hollow to ease a sore shoulder. A patch or covet ing’
piece can he stitched on in any position ; in fact, a collar can
be completely re-covered by anyone. The operation is so
simple that FAILURE IS IMPOSSIBLE. The Stitcher is
equally useful for hoot, saddle and harness repairs. Rivets
at e good as a make-shift, but they are no use for collars, and
stitching is preferable for most mends. The Marvel makes
double-thread hand-sewing, the real tradesman’s stitch, so
easy that anyone can re-sole a welted hoot, repair a hurst
upper, or mend a rip in a saddle or harness, with light or
heavy thread, or with brass or copper wire. Full printed
directions are supplied, and each Marvel Stitcher is sent out
threaded up ready for use, with a good serviceable awl. The
price is only 1/6, including postage to any address. For co.lar
sewing a special awl is needed, that makes the price of the
complete outfit 2/6. Fine work, like boor, uppers, can be sewn
with a stout Stitcher, hut a neater job is made with a light
Stitcher. If you order both fine and stout Stitches you may
have the two for 2/6. or with the Special Collar Awl for 3/6
carriage paid. Obtainable only from

A cabled yarn of last week told how a
Roumanian captain of artillery beheaded a lawyer
in the street of a Moldavian town. The lawyer
was trying to horsewhip the captain, and the
latter, awaking from his reverie and becoming
aware of the fact, lashed out so wildly with his
sword that the lawyer fell in two pieces and
abandoned the active pursuit of his profession.
“Billem”: What happened to a Fusion
candidate:—
The electoral rolls give the names, addresses and occu-
pations of constituents. This is sufficiently precise for
the identification of the males, but it falls short of the
social dignity of some females. The occupation of nearly
every married woman is stated to be “domestic duties.”
For instance, you will read :
“ 7439—Smith John, Costs House,Sharkville, Solicitor."
“7440—Smith Sarah, Costs House, Sharkville, Domestic
Duties.”
“7441—Smith Zara, Costs House, Sharkville, Domestic
Duties.”
“6831 Robins Kate, Costs House, Sharkville, Domestic
Duties.”
“5437—Parsons Nellie, Costs House, Sharkville, Do-
mestic Duties.”
Obviously, Sarah Smith is the wife of John Smith,
solicitor, and mistress of Costs House, and Kate
Robins and Nellie Parsons are her maids. Also, there is
a reasonable supposition that Zara Smith is the daughter
of Costs House. Yet, the four feminines are similarly
described, and credited with “ domestic duties,” which
sounds and looks very much like “ Mary Ann Slavey.”
There was at least one campaign tragedy over this
matter. It happened in East Sydney, where Sammy
Ices, ex-M.L.A. and ex-Mayor, was making a difficult
effort to hold George Reid’s seat for the Fusion. Clerks
were engaged on the job of addressing circulars to con-
stituents, and, of course, took the details from the rolls.
This vvas apparently a simple matter, only requiring the
addition of “Esquire” to every male not definitely de-
nominated “Laborer.” But thousands of letters were
addressed something like this:—“Mrs. Emiline Fitz-
George, Domestic Duties, street, Darlinghurst," or
Potts Point, or Rostyn Gardens, or Rushcutter’s Bay.
And post haste the}' were dispatched before anyone
detected the blunder. Lees didn’t get in. No man who
circularised a constituent as “Mrs! Howard Fitzsmith,
Domestic Duties,” could hope to get in. He could only
hope to fall in.
“Billy B. : ” passes the saveloys :
Will somebody tell me what attraction there is in ex-
pensive food ? Why do people rush to Marseilles House
and eat 10s. or 21s. worth of tucker branded soup de
tureen, screwed mullet-bait, brisket per liver (A la carte
lilanche), roast bullky and apple vinegar, fried cold ham
(a 1 Anglaise), doughboye amende honorable, jelli dernier
ressort, cafb de Morocco, and so on ? Does anybody
1 sally enjoy it? Is it a habit, a vice, a penance, or
plain swagger? Friends of mine who occasionally come
to Sydney are never happy till they have dragged me to
Calais House, handed me the time-table, and urged me to
proceed the total swine. Then for the next two hours a long
procession of waiter moves between us and the kitchen
carrying hunks from the mountains and boilers of hot,'
cold, boiled, blubbered, skinned, unskinned, sweet, sour,
tough, sloppy foods and other things. It always reminds
me of a string of lumpers running along a gangway be-
tween a hulk and a steamer, carrying baskets of coal
and heaving them into the bunkers. And the place is
always full—full of stout men with flaps of flesh hanging
loose around their necks, and women with gold or brass
teeth that flash down towards the cabbage. And elderly
women. Elderly women should never eat except
in the privacy of their bedrooms. And young
girls seeing the possibilities of life through the
sheen of a wineglass. They never see the facts of life
through a wineglass; these are invariably seen through
tears. I revolted the other night. I refused to go to
Bordeaux House. “Not on your life,” I said to the
Reverend ; “ you come with me.” The pubs were shut,
nut I knew a handy sly-grog joint where we could get a
nite and sup—two sups if necessary. Five minutes later
we were in a half-lighted room, drinking beer out of big
i umblers and eating hot saveloys. There were half a dozen
men in the place—quiet men, who spoke in the reserved
voices of those who have learned to know life too well
to be afraid or glad of it. Out of the smoke wreaths
came clips of sentences: “. . . saw him last in Canton.”
t • yes; heard of it. Killed him, didn’t they?”
everywhere and frightened niggers.”
V „ oc * a 'l ove '' the deck and” “... . a joint in
Frisco.” “...wouldn’t know her now—opium and”
... lost everything on the red.” It was the night of
the Reverend’s life. He ate seven saveloys, and drank
the better part of three large bottles of plain beer. The •
rain had whipped the pavements clean when we came
out In the early morning. A falling star spread its white
arms across the sky. “Supper here to-morrow night?”
queried the Reverend. “ Sure,” said I.
“ Trotter” writes about a small country:—
Roosevelt’s N. Y. Outlook has a striking article on
Denmark. The country is ruled by the small farmers. A
quarter of a century ago its rural industry had the pros-
pect of being destroyed by the wheat of America,
Russia and Argentina. The agricultural policy was
turned right round. Went in for butter, egg's, bacon,
poultry and so forth. Commission sent to Ireland to
inquire how Ireland managed to export so much in
e SJf s ar *d bacon to England. Evidently found out
all about it. Consequence is that within the last few
.years there have been four Commissions from Ireland and
Scotland to inquire how 7 Denmark does it. There are
about 1250 credit societies furnishing capital to buy land.
These led the State to advance money from the Treasury.
Over 89 per cent, of the farmers own their land. There
are 250,000 farms in this small population and small
country, 10,000,000 acres being cultivated. The very
large farms, remnants of feudal estates, are only one-
tenth of the agricultural area. Average size of farms,
comprising nine-tenths of all Denmark, is 39 acres.
About 100,000 agriculturists have areas from 131
'acres to 150 acres. This is the strongest party
in Denmark, with seven-tenths of the land. Magnifi-
cent body of men, expert in scientific agriculture.
Now Denmark exports hugely to England and Germany,
also to South America and even to the Philippines. Total
annual export about £75 for each farm, though 133,000
of the 250,000 are under 13J acres. The average of these
is only a little over three acres. The farmer gets all he
produces absolutely all. A Socialist ideal is generally
attained so far as that there is no middleman, no ex-
ploiter, no capitalist except the beneficent money-lender,
State or otherwise. State owns the railways. There are
1087 co-operative dairies, with 150,000 members, and 200
other dairies of private ownership. Nearly 95 per cent, of
the farmers are members of co-operative dairies, which ship
nearly £200,000 worth of butter weeklyto England. The
Co-operative Egg Export Society has 57,000 members.
In 1908 its export mounted to £1,320,000. There are
536 co-operative savings banks. Their deposits in 1906
were £41,700,000. The depositors numbered 1,352,000-
over half the population—and the average was £3l. The
farmer buys everything through co-operation. The turn-
over of purchases by the societies in 1907 was £2,500,000.
In Sydney, nowadays, even the policemen
walk on the wrong side of the footpath.

POINTS FOR INVESTORS.
The business has been established for 30
years, and is known throughout New Zealand,
and has a large and lucrative oversea trade.
Messrs. Bowron Bros., the present owners, are
desirous of retiring from business, having made a
competence.
From the foregoing particulars and figures it
will be seen that the Colonial trade amounts to
about ,£120,000 per annum, whilst the Oversea
trade is about £"200,000 per annum, including
about £20,000 for clients.
A perusal of the above extracts from the
Balance-Sheets must convince intending investors
of the undoubtedly profitable character of the
business.
The profits shown in such Balance-Sheets are
sufficient to pay a 12 per cent, dividend on the
issued capital, and to place a substantial sum to a
Reserve Fund, after allowing for writing-off,
depreciation, etc.
The assets have been valued on a most conser-
vative basis, and are of so solid and tangible a
character and easily convertible into money, that
even the most cautious investors will be safe in
applying for shares in this Company.
The Stock also, being in marketable condition,
forms a liquid asset that can promptly be turned
into coin, and its market value is considerably
augmented on account of the increase in the price
of leather, hides, etc.
Bowron Bros. & Company, Limited, will hand
over the business and assets as a going concern to
this Company ; and the Managers- of the various
branches will be retained, as they are all experi-
ehced men who have proved their capability by
long and efficient service.
Special attention is‘ drawn to the fact that
90,000 shares have been underwritten, thus assur-
ing the immediate flotation of the Company. The
business of the Company is safe, sound and profit-
able, and greatly increased profits may be looked
for from the present branches and also from the
new ones to be opened in Sydney, Melbourne,
Brisbane and other parts’of the Commonwealth as
may seem opportune to the Directors.
The properties of the Company are admirably
situated, and efficient and frequent renewals have
eliminated all useless and obsolete parts.
The profits for the two years ending 30th Sep-
tember, 1909, amount to ,£46,769, after making
all prudent and necessary deductions.
The Shares of the Company ought to go to a
considerable premium on present earnings and
the undoubted prospects of the business.
Investors are fortunate in being offered this
opportunity of investing capital in so sound and
Stable a concern, and should avail themselves
thereof at once and forward their applications for
shares without delay.
The Company will be listed on the Stock Ex-
changes of New Zealand , Sydney r Melbourne and
Adelaide., thus giving investors a security which
can be readily converted into cash..
Cheques and applications may be sent to the
Secretary , or direct to the Company’s Bankers in
Sydney, Melbourne , Brisbane , Adelaide , Christ-
church , Wellington, Dunedin and Palmerston
North.

Business, Robbery, etc.
The Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney lately
published its 124th half-yearly report, which would make
the institution 62 years old. But there was an “old
bank" established in 1834 which was re-modelled in 1848.
It is generally said that the bank started business in the
premises now occupied by Sargents, Limited, in George-
street, near King-street; but prior to that it had offices
in Bridge-street, in a building known as the Colonnade.
It was not till January, 1835, that the chairman an-
nounced that the board had “ leased for seven years a
house in George-street, a few doors from King-street, to be
used as the head office of the bank and as a residence of
the managing-director, at the high rent of £285 per
annum. It had been arranged to purchase it for £1950.”
The building had been erected by Mr. Richard Sullivan,
a draper in Market-street.

“Jim” Clarke, Munro, and the other Queens-
land pearlers who decided to give Thursday Island a rest
a few years ago, and went up into Dutch waters at the
Aru Islands, have organised things there as the pearling
business never was organised before. They threw every-
thing into the pot, and formed the Celebes Trading Co.,
so as to put the lot under one management and abolish
competition; The unit is the lugger, from which the
actual diving is done ; and there is a schooner as a centre
or dep6t for every fleet of luggers. Communication
between the luggers and their schooner is kept up by
motor-launches, which clear the shells from the luggers
every day so that they can be opened fresh on the
schooners, where the job is done under the eye of re-
liable white men. Around Thursday Island the com-
munication was, and still is, by erratic sailing boats,
which is one reason why tile pearler frequently doesn’t
get the Thursday Island pearl—it is found and forked out
before the shell gets to the schooner. Finally, the co.
has a steamer which keeps up communication between
the schooners and the harbor depfit at Dobo. Its job is
to gather the shell and distribute stores. The rapid com-
munication means also that if part of a crew falls sick it
can be replaced, or luggers can be concentrated on to a
patch that wants to be lifted quickly. Still there are
cockroaches in even the Aru soup. The Dutchmen don’t
let) anybody lift their treasures for nothing ; and, any-
way, the Aru grounds have been worked so long—chiefly
by Arabs till the Australian crowd arrived —that it is
pretty well all very deep diving now. Wherefore Thurs-
day Island needn’t be at all surprised if it sees some more
of the Aru fleet back before long.

“W.D.Y.”: The Melbourne Argus (9/7/10) in
an article referring to the Commonwealth note-issue,
stated that Prime Minister Fisher calculates it will take
1000 days to sign 3,500,000 notes, and that “ obviously he
has not over-estimated the time, as 3500 a day would be
heavy work for those signing.” To this I say “ Rodents !”
If the two signatories are going to sign only 3500 notes a
day they will have a rosy billet ; in fact, i don’t know
how they will fill in time. I happen to be in a bank, and
having.signed thousands and thousands of notes I think
I know a little about it. I have many and many a time
signed 1000 in an hour. I used to race with the man
who did the countersigning, and unless we could do 1000
within a few minutes of the hour it was a certainty that
we had not bustled ourselves. Of course, if a man hap-
pens to be burdened with a name such as “William
Fitzmauriee Carmichael,” and insists on signing each
note in full, it will take slightly longer than an hour to
get through 1000 of them ; but any ordinary signature
can be affixed 1000 times to the hour. Anyhow, I wish
the Commonwealth would give me the job of signing 3500
notes a day and pay me at “ heavy w'ork ” rates. The
only thing I would get tired of would be the holiday
each afternoon.
“Janor ” : Can endorse “The Hack’s” appre-
ciation of Australian-tinned fish, as packed by the V. P.
Co. (B. 7/7/’10), but when he blames the “fool public”
for preferring the imported product of the sea he’s off
side. Th re are thousands of good Australians who would
consume home goods, but there is no opportunity to
buv. The average country store stocks few lines of Aus-
tralian manufacture—the wholesale houses see to that.
What the wholesaler hates above all things is the sight of
an Australian manufacturer who deals direct with the
retailer or even with the public, for if that kind
of person multiplies the importer will have to
get work. But the importing cuss is still a power
in the land, and many stores are but retail
branches of the big Sydney warehouses, and are tied as
securely as the brewer’s pub or the watchful dog that
bays the moon. Therefore, I name the importer as the
great enemy of the local product, and the fit and proper
person to be cursed by “The Hack.” When he is pul-
verised by a real tariff the public will have the oppor-
tunity to get outside all the Australian food it can buy.
* * * *
“Silas”: Every injury sustained in a railway
accident has its recognised commercial value. This fact
has been demonstrated co my entire satisfaction. I know
two young men (Richmond sufferers) who have actually
raised money on their hurts in the parlor of a humane
Hebrew who helps the afflicted on sound business lines.
We in Melbourne are given to understand that a broken
neck, the result of a' sensational railway smash, is as
negotiable as a Government debenture. A shock is a
more dubious asset, but good enough security fora couple
of tenners if accompanied by nervous derangement and
symptoms of idiocy.
* * * *
“ N.” : The Salvation Army has done better in
Melbourne than anywhere else in the world. Look at
its magnificent Bourke-street property, the gorgeous
Victoria Parade Training Home, the immense People’s
Metropole (King-street), the almost unrivalled printing
office in Albert-street, etc. All made out of men and
women abjectly cadging for pennies every night. The
trading operations in tea (the great warehouse is at the
back of Her Majesty’s Theatre), clothing, pianos, etc., are
vast. The Bourke-street property was built for the
Y.M.C.A. at a cost of £55,000, of which £29,000 was paid.
The Army got it for £19,500. Now' worth £30,000.
Who’s coming in for the boodle? Nobody knows who
owns the concern, but it is presumed to be all Booth.

“Oby ”: Hair-cutting at 3d. and 4d. is now
common in Sydney. “ How getting on ? ” I asked a Dago
fourpenn.v the other day. “Oh, vera veil,” he replied,
“vera veil.” “ But not so well as when you charged 6d.”
“ Ob betta, much betta.” “How’s that?” “Veil,” he
said, “ ven price come down me thinka vera hard and
decide to trims dogs. Sheep-dogs, Yorkshire terriers
need lot trim. See,” he continued confidentially. “Me
have list of doggie ladies. Me go round ; me say, ‘ Clip-
pem dog; shampoo.’ First time, open eyes; but ven
doggie nicely trim, shampoo, goes in. ‘ 6 my ! ’ is cry
and me gets half-crown, sometimes five bob.” “ Do you
take the dogs down here?” “No, no; dat vould give
game avay; de bathrooms in de house. Leetle dogs pay
best and not so dangerous.” “ Glad you’re doing well.”
“Oh, vera veil, tank you ; ven me adds vot I gets vor
trimmin’ dogs to vot me earns by trimmin’ mans at 4d.,
me do vera veil indeed. Den dere’s dis.” He took down
a bottle of lotion. “ Dis maka hair soft and glossy.
Spaniels, poodles take lot. Me sell case a week.” “But
that’s the stuff j'ou’ve been selling as a cure for bald-
ness.” “ Oh, yes ; just de same. All de same. Only Is.
bottle. You don’t want some? ”
“McGinty”: Did any Bulletin reader ever
browse on victuals bought with money earned by collect-
ing time-payment instalments on a commission basis?
If he can show the slightest s gns of a corporation as a
result, I unreservedly hand him the “Arnott.” Took a
job on the above line's the other day, and never knew till
then how prolific, disease-stricken and “ never at home”
Sydney wives are. Result of first day’s field work in
Western Suburbs: —
Called on 23 Mrs. B.’s. Unable to meet liabilities
owing to having one or more of the following complaints:
Tvphoid, yellow jaundice, measles, “drunken husbins,"
ringworm, “appengercitis,” asthma, rheumatism, “mov-
ing,” or “moved,” neurasthenia, croup and “infloo-
enza.”
19 Mrs. S’s. were “ not at home.”
10 Mrs. J’s. had suspended business matters owing to
being confined.
2 Mrs. R’s. ditto (triplets).
1 Mrs. K. This was the climax. Rung the bell
timidly. Terrible rustling of the Venetians and a whis-
pered “ Who is it, Pearly?” “Dunno, mum; but he
looks like a time-payment man.” And then, at the top
of a small voice,.“Shall I say yer out, mum?"

“Shutter”: There is a cheap photographer’s
place on the way to the office, and, whenever I can spare
the time, I stop and gloat over the hilarious jumble of
pictures in the show-case outside. An aged salt, with a
beard like a goat’s, occupies the central position. He
wears an intensely solemn look, and holds a fat telescope
stiffly on his knee. When ashore, I think he must be one
of the pillars of a Little Bethel; he is the severely
respectable type of seaman of which church pillars are
made. There is not the slightest hint of a joyful tilt in
the set of his gold-braided cap ; it sits as straightly on
his head as a belltopper. Next picture is that of a
retired serio-chronic in tights and top-boots. Her figure
resembles Jeffries’s before he started active training for
his disastrous collision with Johnson, and she wears a
leer which is evidently intended to be a bewitching smile.
The respectable mariner on her right hand probably
never saw such a chronic in real life ; in the show-case
she is standing shamelessly at his side. Next- to the
chronic is a well-oiled Chow in European dress, with his
pigtail neatly coiled like a hangman’s rope on the summit
of his skull. Beyond the Chow is another actress—one
of the pathetic, street-arab brand. Her male garments
have been most carefully made ragged with a pair of
scissors, and she has posed herself for the picture in the
graceful attitude invariably adopted by arabs when
about to die through starvation and being moved
on by Inspector Bucket. The look on her upturned
face is supposed to be pathetic ; it is merely villainous
and insulting. Next picture is that of a middle-aged
skating professor in tights. Like most of the people who
do trivial and absurd things for a living, he has en-
deavored to look as stern and useful as Kitchener. A
heavy black moustache gives him a certain resemblance
to the soldier, but the tights and the roller skates spoil
it. A large group photograph is the next item ;it repre-
sents a Chow and half-Chow picnic. Most of the Chows
have hidden their pigtails underneath their boxer hats.
All of them—male and female—wear European clothing.
In the midst of the slant-eyes sits a shame-faced white.
Young Chows stand behind him ; old and middle-aged
Chows sit beside him; dashing Chows sprawl gracefully
in front of him in fearful imitation of the young Euro-
pean bloods who frequent outdoor feeds and frolics.
Round this terrible scene are pinned pictures of stiff
marines, tidy sailors in tremendous trousers, a few por-
traits of the sailors and marines’ lady friends, one or
two more chronics, and another dozen or so well-oiled
Chows. Judging by the way he pervades this one place,
the Chow seems to be a pretty vain heathen ; there is
nothing on earth like his look of greasy complacency
when he has got his hangman’s rope coiled nicely out of
sight. If ever ill-luck drives me again in front of a
camera, I am going to search the photographer’s show-
case for Chows before I sit to him.

“Jimmie Pannikin ” : I knew there must come
a rebellion against the inferentially-insulting signs so
common now on city and suburban business places—■
“ Under entirely new management,” and such like. A
few days ago I saw this vigorous and refreshing an-
nouncement billed big outside a long-established business
place ;
UNDER ENTIRELY OLD MANAGEMENT.
NO ENTIRELY NF.W MISMANAGEMENT.
I went home quite pleased.
The Commonwealth’s baby dependency of Papua
has a fine chance to hatch some good business and
a large reform out of one egg. The issue of pub
licenses in the Territory is prohibited. There are
two already; but they were there when the pro-
hibition arrived. It wasn’t, of course, intended
to confer on them a monopoly of ever-increasing
value; the idea was to stop the private vending
of liquor among natives from going any further,
and to keep any extension of the dangerous, but
highly profitable, business in the hands of the
Government. So far, however, the Govern-
ment has done nothing. It hasn’t opened any
kind of liquor-store whatever; and the most
obvious effect of the prohibition is to drive trade
to the two existing pubs and to the wholesale and
“sly” dealers in liquor. Moreover, the old
licensees don’t feel too sure of their position.
They evidently realise that they are an anomaly,
and will be wiped out some day. Consequently,
though the two principal towns of Papua want
accommodation for travellers and lodgers more
than they want almost anything else on earth, the
two old pubs continue to be nothing except well-
meaning but small and primitive shanties ; where-
fore in the wild rush of population families
are living three deep in four-roomed cottages.
In fact, the potentate of a big concern
who arrived with a • valet for himself and
a lady’s maid for his wife had to push his
family into a small cottage which was already
overcrowded with two other families ; and the
valet and the lady’s maid seem to have been
driven out with the goats. Outside the two chief
townships, in smaller townships where accommo-
dation is just as badly wanted, there is as a rule
even less of it; for private persons won’t put up
accommodation houses that can’t supply liquor,
and the Government which could supply liquor
hasn’t made a move to do it. No doubt the
baby’s Government is handicapped by want of
funds: its entire revenue is a mere £50,000 or so
a year, and there’s a terrible lot of work to do
with the money. But there would be such an
amazing profit in one or two good residential pubs
that it would be very well worth while sacrificing
something to make a start. Or at the worst, in
order to set the experiment going, the mother
Commonwealth might even finance the infant to
the extent of a pub or two, a few sticks of furni-
ture, and a gallon or so of grog.
“0.K.,” from the scene of disaster :
It is stated by Melbourne Agk, with a knowledge, pre-
sumably, of how the claims for compensation are being
settled, that “ the Richmond accident threatens to
absorb fully £80,000.” In the recent smash nine persons
were killed outright; 106 or thereabouts were recorded
as “injured” more or less badly before they left the
platform, and some 350 have subsequently reported them-
selves to Tait’s department as sufferers from the effects
of the collision. The fact that everybody who was thrown
out of a seat, or suddenly alarmed in any way by the
catastrophe, was “ shocked ” thereby is undeniable. It
goes without the saying. And the fact that the
after effects of “ shock ” are almost invariably
more serious than the shocked one suspects
at the time is likewise undeniable. When a patient,
suffering from what he considers an unaccountable ner-
vous complaint, consults a physician, he is asked to
remember a “shock” that would explain the case. If
he can remember a railway accident from which he “ for-
tunately escaped without injury,” he is told that he can
attribute his creeping paralysis, or what not, to his
“ lucky escape ”of yore. Nobody who has experienced
the alarming sensation of being in a railway accident can
claim to have srot out of it unharmed. Yet it is the
selfish policy of all railway managements, and the foolish
rule with the unreflecting public, to speak of any claim for
compensation from an unbruised passenger as a “try
on.” It is clear that if 465 claims in the Richmond
case are to be settled at a total cost of £BO,OOO, a great
many of them must be practically condemned by the Vic.
Railway Commissioners as “tries on.” Hitherto, the
people have sanctioned this cheap method of disposing
of “ shock ” claims, but now they begin to perceive that
they owe it to themselves to take a just and humane
view of their duty to claimants. A maximum amount
of compensation is established by law. A dead man's
widow and children can demand no more than £2OOO from
the Department whose ill-management put the family i nto
mourning. The law preserves the Vic. railways from a loss
of more than £lB,OOO upon the nine corpses drawn from the
wreckage at Richmond. Among the 100 and odd living
persons who were mutilated and palpably invalided
by the accident were many whose damages must
result in a loss of more than £lOOO or £2OOO to their
wage-earning powers, even though they escape without
lasting injury. And of the remaining 350 who had no
corporal signs to show of their having met with a terrible
experience, how many, or how few, are to receive any
reasonable consideration for the possible, or probable,
future ills to which the “ shock ” doomed them ? If a fixed
minimum wage is a fair thing for workers, a fixed mini-
mum sum of compensation should be only a fair thing for
railway viotims. And the minimum should be not less
than £lOO.

“Fraulein” on Grant Hervey’s remark re-
garding Portland (B. 21/7/’10): “And the old
town does not grow ” :
No, and it’s not likely to. I went down to Portland
last summer by rail from Casterton. I left Casterton a
kind of Liberal, and arrived in Portland a red-hot
Socialist. On either side of the line after leaving
Casterton stretch miles and miles of fertile land, with
a bounteous rainfall and an ideal climate—land which,
nevertheless, remains uncleared, with nothing to be seen
on it but sheep and rabbits. No houses, no traces of
settlement except the buildings clustered in the little
townships along the line. All those thousands of acres
of well-watered rich soil are untouched by a plough.
Even the fencing is poor and ramshackle. Practically
nothing is taken in by the train except rabbits.
Nearing Portland the line runs through a patch of poor
country. “ This land, no doubt,” 1 said, “ will be given
over to sheep. No decent living could be got from it
any other way." No such thing, however ! As soon
as the poor land comes, people are settled on it,
trying to make a living out of a few hungry acres.
Out beyond comes the heath country, the land
that is to be reclaimed and settled. It certainly grows
root vegetables of an enormous size, but it will mop up
one fortune in draining and another in fertilisers, and
then, I believe, it will only last a year or two. It is
■ poor, wet, sour and hungry-looking, yet settlers are
coming to it whilst fat lands lie idle.
It will take more than a railway to resurrect Portland.
The people are too subdued, too docile, too fatalistic.
They have seen the summer visitors come and go too
often, and are now content to stand and wait. So the
old town does not grow.
Josiah Thomas, Federal Postmaster-General,
has been more cheerful than usual since that
hard-luck band of martyrs— Judkins, Worrall
and co.—called to see him the other morning with
the usual impracticable request—this time that
letters from, as well as to, Tatteiisall’s should
be stopped in the post. Josiah is a good church-
man himself, and frequently adorns the pulpit;
but he is also a Labor man, and a Labor man has
to be a most amazing Christian to forget and
forgive the gross misrepresentations and slanders
used against his party by people like Mud-
kins. It was this same Mudkins who,
during the Federal elections campaign, stated
that Labor was associated with, all the
drinking and gambling elements in the com-
munity. Judkins seemed embarrassed when
this circumstance was recalled by Josiah, but it
was nothing to the uncomfortable feeling created
by Josiah’s next remarks. Tasmania, he pointed
out, was the only State that made anything out
of Tatt.’s, and it might be as well for the depu-
tation to interview the local Premier, especially
as he is not a Laborite, but belongs to its own
political party. Then he went on to assert that
he was a hater of all forms of gambling, whether
in horse-races, card games, stocks, mining shares,
wheat, land or what not, and would cheerfully
place the matter before his'colleagues with a view
to drastic legislation if the churches would
promise to back him up and to supply him with a
reliable definition of “ gambling.” This knocked
the deputation clean out, and when it recovered it
could only blurt out something to the effect that
it was so used to asking for bread and getting
bricks that when it was offered a whole baker’s
shop it doubted the genuineness of the proceed-
ings, and would prefer the boon by instalments.

Loss of appetite
can be cured
by SCOTT’S
Emulsion
which is not a medicine that
merely gives temporary re-
lief, Scott’s Emulsion per-
manently restores appetite.
Hundreds of people have
written to say that appetite
has been restored by Sc o 11’s
Emulsion. For example,
Mrs. J. Mclntosh wrote, 3rd
May, 1909, from 52, Cowper
Street, Waverley, Sydney,
N.S.W.:
“My daughter, aged two years, would
barely eat enough to keep her alive. She
became almost too weak to stand, and
gh
her vitality was so low that she
wanted to do nothing but
sleep. After taking Scott’s
Emulsion for tivo days, her
appetite came back quite sud-
denly, and she is now run-
ning about with a healthy
colour in her cheeks. This
trademark was on the emul-
sion I bought. ”
If you wish to get back ap-
petite and decide to buy
Scott’s Emulsion, decide
also to GET SCOTT’S
EMULSION. You may be
asked to buy another emul-
sion and told it is “just as
good as Scott’s.” Substitute
emulsions can only be sold
on the reputation of Scott's
Emulsion.
Scott’s Emulsion cures the disease
no matter the age of the patient—and
r/ill be approved by your Doctor for
Lost Appetite if you ask him.

taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will be

(x.B. : “Idealist” has some good ideas in a
vague sort of way ; but it is too indefinite. It might
refer to Christopher Columbus or the man who devised a
new breed of fowls... .A.C.E. : “The Plainman's Song"
is presumably some relation to Plain Song, otherwise
Plain Chant or Gregorian Music. This is in no way re-
lated to Plain Bill, who was the late W. B. Dailey ; nor
has it the slightest connection with Bill Plain, who is
member for Geelong in the Vic. State Parliament.

(apart from a few gleams) in the matter-of-fact style
which characterises a catalogue. Rasmus: An un-
speakably gruesome thing. And there is neither novelty
nor interest in it—just plain burial .. J.R.K.: In the
matter of being about nothing in particular your yarn
about takes the prize, also the bun H.P.: Intentions
of “Litany" are strictly honorable, but it is a mono-
tonous piece of work A.C.: Tale of untidy scramble

ments of novelty. ..F.B.: Your shearing-shed is too much
like a hundred other sheds.... A. McN.: No, thanks....
Tenterden : “ Woman’s View ” is very true, but some-

expressions obviously dragged in for the sake of a rhyme.
“And struggle 'midst its sway” doesn’t seem to mean
anything save that “sway” rhymes with “fray.”....
H. P. : “ Litany ” rather stiff... .Scutum : The svvaggie’s
device re the shirt and the mosquitoes is less intelligi-
ble than it might be... .Jakay : The forecastle victuals
have been written up before and in much better style
Fraulein : And your “small for its age" whisky
joke isn’t a joke either. It’s a hoary chestnut
J. McM. : You want to know why the B. makes a fetich
of a gold basis for notes, and you propose that when the
State wants to build a £500,000 railway it shall simply
issue £500,000 of non-interest bearing paper. The scheme
is all right—provided you can guarantee to find people
to take the notes at face value and to go on taking

boulder. . L.M. (V.): “Love and Hate—a Tragedy of

....Madrigal (W.A.): The conclusion of the story is
excellent: “Then the black cat’s hair rose on his back,
his tail fuzzed up like a bottle brush, and with an
unearthlj' yowl, he fled spitting from the room. From
the topmost branch of a fir-tree on the lawn he saw
. . . Cecily sitting back in an armchair with the tail of
her beautiful creamy gown dabbling in the creeping
stream of blood and laughing, laughing. . . ." Unfortun-
ately the rest of it isn’t nearly so jolly and comfortable.
... .The Flapper : There are about five different samples
of metres in it. Apart from that, it is a fearfully crude
production from a grammatical point of view, and the
subject is ancient.... H. E. W. (M.L.): Very crude verse.
H. Howell: “ Evening Dawn ” appears to have been
mangled in transmission. One verse :
Golden rays pitiably dwindling
Herald a less welcome cycle
The final spread promoting warmth
Reft from the joys of all.
... .O.H.C.: The third line of the triolet might have been
better L. Bird: “ A Commonplace Affair ” is dashed
commonplace, and so dull that we are half-inclined to
believe you wrote it of m dice aforethought... .Hyacinth :
Set to music, it would make a popular pathetic ballad.
H.J. (North Fitzroy, V.): “Youth” is a howling,
brain-feverish waste of words. The letter which accom-
panied the MS. was simple and direct, and we expected
something better of you Craigie Buckler (Q.): You
lack technical skill. The verses are just the ordinary begin-
ner’s stuff. ....Languid Lou (V.): Thedogs’home verses—
written on the back of a map—are monotonous. Every
stanza begins with the same bark E.S.B.: The sailor’s
toast appears to hate been composed whilst the ship was
rolling heavily E.R. (S. A.): Too slight.... W. J.R. (V.):
Verses jolt heavily in several places Margaret F. (Gee-

Of freedom why there is no end,
And to the joke [yoke?] we’ll never bend ;
We live in a land of sunny skies
Where scarcely anyone ever dies,
Our land, Australia 1
Our death-rate is certainly low ; but, all the same, 46,426
people died in the Commonwealth in 1908. The old
settler in the reposeful country district makes the
bravest effort of all to keep going for ever; this morn-
ing’s paper reports the death of him, aged respectively
96 and 98. But even the old settler has to drop off at last.

“ Sydneyite ” : It’s cheaper to steal money
in South Africa and be bagged by the police than
to borrow it. Case in point. One Gilbert, an
accountant at the Port Elizabeth branch of the
General Assurance Comp my, who was recently
charged with embezzling £IBB, was sentenced to
pay £2O, in default four months’ imprisonment.
If he had borrowed the money from the Jews at
10 per cent, it would have cost nearly the same
amount for the first 12 months, and he would still
have owed the principal, but by lifting it from
the till he owed nothing and was £l6B to the good.
Which is good, if not sound, finance.

THE Company has been formed to acquire the freehold property situated at Manly, known as the ‘ Clarendon
Hotel, facing- the Ocean Beach, together with the furniture, license and goodwill, and to erect and carry on
a large and up-to-date Hotel. The property has a frontage of 175 ft, to the North Steyne Parade (Ocean
Beach), and 158 ft. to Raglan Street, and 112 ft, to Francis Street. , ,
Manly is regarded as one of the finest natural seaside resorts in the world, and is daily becoming more popular,
as is evidenced by the fact that in the short space of four years it mote than doubled its fixed population. ,
It is only during the last few years that the advantages of surf-bathing have become apparent to residents in
Australia, and the increasing returns from the ferry-boats plying between the city and Manly are considered tne
best guide to show the future possibilities of this seaside resort. The information officially supplied by the Manager
of the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company, Ltd., shows that between the Ist July, 1909, and oOth June,
1910, THE PASSENGERS CARRIED (EXCLUSIVE OF SEASON-TICKET HOLDERS) TOTALLED 1,i01,695,
which he states is an increase of 50 per cent, on the number carried five years ago.
It will thus be seen that no other town or pleasure resort in Australia can claim anything approaching Maniy s
record of visitors. , ~, , .
The following figures, furnished by Mr. H. Robey, the well-known land and property agent of Manly, show the
strides that have been made in the property market at Manly during the last few years :
Land known as the “ Chute Land ” in
1900 sold at
1910 offered and refused
Land known as the “Skating Rink” (Ocean Beach)in
1901 sold at
1910 resold at
Land between the Clarendon and the Steyne Hotels in
1900 sold at
1910 resold at
Land in The Corso in 1901 sold at
1908 resold at
1909 land opposite sold
1910 adjoining refused ..
Corner Block known as the “ Bank Corner ” in
1905 was sold for
1910 was resold for
In addition to the heavy increase in land values, Mr. D. Hogan, the Town Clerk of Manly, states that in the last
Seven years the number of buildings has increased over 100 per cent.
These facts further emphasise the growing prosperity of Manly.
The Sun dated 11th July, announced that a pier, 900 ft. in length, is to be erected on the Ocean Beach on a site
between the’ Corso and the Clarendon Hotel, and the preliminary work, such as taking soundings, etc., is already
in progress The area of the pier head is to be about 300 ft. long by 126 ft, wide. A handsome pavilion with a hroad
promenade balcony outside will be erected at the pier head for roller skating and other amusements. Not only will
this attraction create an additional source of revenue to the new hotel, but its patrons will also derive considerable
personal advantages therefrom.
The iSpit to Manly tramway route, approved of by the Public Works Department, is now nearing completion,
and will pass immediately alongside the present site of the Clarendon Hotel. The Clarendon will, theiefore, be
the first stopping-place on arrival at the Beach, and it is not unreasonable to expect that the majority of the pas-
sengers will alight at this point.
The Directors have carefully, considered the position of Manly from every standpoint, and are confident of its
future. They have arranged with Messrs. Robertson and Marks, Architects, to prepare the plans and specifications

The annual sum required for payment of a 10 per cent, dividend on the capital of the Company amounts to
£3500 and the amount required for interest on the Debentures is £660, or total annual sum of £4160 : therefore, it
is reasonable to expect that even after providing the £lOOO per annum for depreciation or reserve fund, a substantial
balance will be available for further dividends.
The present business will be carried on during building operations, and the Company will be receiving revenue
right from the commencement. It is not anticipated, therefore, that the whole of the capital will be called up
sooner than 12 months. _. ,
The Articles of Association provide with regard to qualification and remuneration of Directors as follows .
The qualification of a Director shall be the holding of 500 shares in the Company, and if not already qualified,
he shall obtain his qualification within two months from the date of his appointment.

Director.

IN BANANA LAND
“S.R. : No wander Queensland is grow-
wea,'y of the importing mania, when so many
of the ghosts of the wretched lunacy squat in the
public places of Brisbane and gibber unpleasantly.
One of them appeared the other day on the
Water and Sewerage Board premises, and insisted
on its history being explained to the new mem-
bers. It would be hard to find a more antiquated
water supply system in Australia than Brisbane’s,
and the recently-defunct Board decided to import
a Yankee expert to prepare a scheme for the im-
provement of the supply. So one Hazen
was brought out and handed £3OOO for his
advice. Most of the things he said had
been said before, and the fee looked so
pei pend lcular that large squads and even
battalions of citizens made odious remarks
these citizens were only temporarily quelled bv
the burned explanation of the Board that Hazen
had a fearful and unparalleled amount of work to
do, and of course, in addition to supplying every
land of information, he would provide plans
estimates, etc. A few months after the Ameri-
can had departed, however, there arrived a bill
tor £1450 for the plans that he had prepared, and
the odious remarks became more vigorous than
ever. But the most amazing thing is that
whereas Hazen estimated the Enoggera filtration
works to cost £lO,OOO (day labor), the new Board
CKonoT cont , rfl ? t for Part of the work for
£5OOO to Midson, chairman of the old Board, and
/j/yfXj tha 7 fc r the r< L St °( the work wiU cost
day labor). So that either Hazen was
paid £4450 for information and plans that were
not worth the paper used, or the new Board is
incapable of carrying out the instructions of the
expert, ihe public gets it in the neck either
way—as usual.

Electric Mary Ann.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A useful electric motor for household purposes ha
been put on the market. It weighs 171 b., is called “ The
Electric Mary Ann,” and will drive any ordinary house-
hold utensil, such as_ a knife-cleaner, coffee-grinder
mincer, potato-peeler, ice-cream freezer, einr-whlsk and
soon.— Newmtem. ’
SHE comes to cheer a drooping age,
The wrath of lordly man assuage.
To calm the angry woman’s rage,
If calm it any can ;
Not decked in silk or satin sheen,
Nor gay begirt in blue or green,
Appears our new-born Kitchen Queen-
Electric Mary Ann !
What time you hug your morning bed,
What time the morning sun is red.
You hear a buzz behind your head
Of scouring pot and pan.
You turn you round and there she is—
With many a whirr and many a whiz,
She makes the fire before your phiz—
Electric Mary Ann !
She cleans your boots and, dusts your hat,
Or sets a trap to catch the rat,
Or kicks the milk-purloining cat
Full many and many a span ;
She polishes your dirty grate,
Or scrapes the scraps from off the plate.
In all things she is sure as Fate-
Hurrah for Mary Ann !
She whirls a wild rotating brush,
Or stirs a spoon within the mush,
Or bids the baby softly “ Hush ! ”
And cools it with a fan ;
And, if you want to spank the boy,
She’ll weary not in that employ,
But belt him with a holy joy
Electric Mary Ann !
Tis hers to lay the knife and fork,
To dish the peas and carve the pork,
To bring the glass and draw the cork
That cheers a thirsty man ;
She cannot cluck—she cannot clack.
Or stretch your nerves upon the rack,
Or give her missus answers back—
This good new Mary Ann !
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER FLAM.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane. August 6, 1910.
Mt Dear Thargomindah,—
The town is thick with Show visitors. They
come, like Queens of Sheba, from the uttermost
parts of the earth ; and, as they all answer to the
naine of Bill, the place sounds like one huge debt.
Among the army is a fighting parson from the
back of Charters Towers, who, I hear, has an eye
upon the amateur boxing welter.
Great was the blare of the bagpipes at Too-
woomba this week, when the clan Macgregor
paid its official call upon the borough. There
was a stock show of mighty Clydesdales
and Suffolk Punches—tons of living beef
and walking bales of wool; and, incidentally,
there was a civic reception at which many alder-
men were on vigw, as well as their wives and
families. The Vision of the clan was the centre
of an admiring crowd. She doesn t dance, by the
way, which seems a pity, for she looks like a bit of
thistledown. I understand that the chieftain dis-
approves. The vice-regal party, therefore, played
thinking parts at the city ball; while Toowoomba's
youth and beauty trilled and hopped to its heart’s
content. Then there were the races, whereat the
favorites proved as fickle as of yore, and the luck
of Abraham was right up to high-water mark.
On Saturday the party come back to town
to receive the Chelmsford family. The Dudleys,
have, I hear, decided to withhold the light
of their faces from the carnival. Maybe the
G.-G. is thinking unkindly of the rather chilly
time he last spent in the North. Or has he grave
matters of State to attend to?
An excited story has gone round that the
Show people and the Q.T.C. had come to logger-
heads because the club ran a meeting on Show
day. It seems, however, that there was only a
little gentle expression of Opinion, and no imme-
diate danger of civil war, as it was made plain
that the country cousins could easily go a-showing
in the morning and a-nagging after lunch..
Next week we shall make records in the enter-
tainment line. There will be two circuses going,
four moving picture shows, a theatre containing
an “Orchid,” a variety palace, two professional
concert cos. and an amateur ditto, as well as a
cheerful troupe of vaudeville people, including
one Carl Schultz, who will voluntarily hang him-
self with a drop of six feet. I can’t think what
can have given him this singular taste, unless he
found out that he was born to be drowned, and
thereupon decided to turn the fact into money.
Great is the tribulation of two smart suburban
girls. They had been speeding the merry hours
and lost their last car ; and, lacking enough loose
cash between them to hire a cab, they appealed
to a stalwart member of the force to escort them
home. The force was young and a man of taste
to boot, and he rose to the occasion and proved
an ideal escort. But the cream of their joy was
skimmed when they met several young bloods
of their acquaintance; and now they are busy
explaining why they were being taken home by a
policeman.
A number of bachelors combined last week to
establish a record in dances, and they almost did it.
At least, I am told by the lucky girls who were
bidden that it was the “ very nicest thing.” A
few chaperones were there to put a muzzle on the
mouth of Mrs. Grundy; but as the chaperones
were mostly young and attractive, they didn’t
line the wall. In fact, the only things that clung
to the wall were the decorations, which were of
buttercup and azure. Programmes, music and
supper were all of a piece. And they didn’t go
home till morning.
Mrs. Herbert Perry, one of our smartest
matrons, collected her friends in Rowe’s winter
garden last Thursday and fed them on many
things. She clothed herself in a sheaf-like robe
of Nile green crdpe and much applique, topped
by one of the new high-crowned hats relieved
with gold. Lattie Cameron, the daughter-in-
law-to-be, was a vision in grey, with the trickiest
little spats ; and the rest of the folk made a brave
show of spring rags.
On the same evening numbers of people with
horrible tastes assembled in the galleries to watch
about 450 delegates to a Local Authority conference
eat much more than was good for them. The
saving grace, as far as the onlookers were con-
cerned, was the organ solos by the recentlv-re-
appointed city organist, George Sampson, sand-
wiched between selections by the Municipal
Champion band. Some persons sang, but the
audience was forgiving.
Another of the crop of farewell teas was reaped
the other afternoon by the friends of pretty Tilly
Evans, who marries JVlr. Xavier Seppelt at the
end of the month. The knot will be tied in
Sydney, and the moon, I understand, will rise in
Europe.
Yarrabah aboriginal mission station, in the wild
North, has just got a new Rev. gentleman-in-
eharge. But, even if he had been at the game
before, was there really need for one of the local
papers to tell the heathen that he was “seasoned” ?
The Tasmanian Governor, Sir Happy Barron,
managed to get as far as Toowoomba on Friday ;
but there he stayed and waited for the Macgregor
to escort him to the city next day. His visit is to
be almost as brief as the next Government House
reception.
Tender inquiries about Speaker Bell have at
last been rewarded with more cheering news.
Things are at least hopeful, though the patient is
still very weak.
Cardinal Moran will bless the new Mater
Misericordise Hospital on Sunday next. This
accomplished, Governor Macgregor will be called
upon to formally open the doors. What his feel-
ings are at being called upon to do work of this
kind in the midst of a guid Presbyterian Sabbath
doesn’t transpire. I had a private trip over the
big pile last week, and, after an hour’s hard climb,
I came to the conclusion that medals should be
struck for architect R. S. Dods, the contractor,
the clerk of wofks, and the people who contributed
the cash. There is no doubt that the enterprise
of the wonderful woman by whom the whole
scheme has been fostered has given to Brisbane a
hospital which will be one of the finest of its kind
anywhere. It stands upon about the highest
point of the city, and its outlook alone is enough to
cure most troubles. As for its operating block,
its ventilation and its domestic labor-saving ideas,
folk might well come from the four continents to
admire them.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
Daring the past six months 1488 settlers
took up 2,757,271 acres of Bananaland territory,
of which nearly 1,000,000 acres were more or less
cursed with prickly pear. A lot of : pear oblitera-
tors have been suggested, but the best and most
certain is Settler Unlimited.
Of the monthly consignments of immi-
grants which the Phidston Government is
pouring into Queensland only the veriest frac-
tion ever gets north of Capricorn. A few days
ago the Otranto shot over 200 new arrivals into
Brisbane, 13 into Rockhampton, and one into all
North Queensland. The one happened at Port
Douglas, a lonely spot, where the streets are a
bright green, and it is only by a desperate
fight that the rich, fresh grass is kept out of the
public-houses. At this rate N.Q. will muster a
fair population in something like 50,000 years.
Possibly by that time the name will be changed
to South Nippon.

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take ;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache—a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. Theyact splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of

CHAMPION'S TESTIMONY
Miniature Rifle Shooting in South Australia has been brought
almost to a fine art, and the recognised champion of that State may
reasonably be considered a proved expert and authority. Mr. Rupert
J. Copeland, who* recently won the South Australian Championship
with the aid of a
B.S.A. MARTINI RIFLE
After having had considerable experience with other English and
American rifles says: —“The B.S.A. Martini is absolutely unapproachable
fcy anything *»n our market ” And ha is quite correct.
You have probably got as far as you can with your present rifl?,
but just try one of the latest B.S.A. Martini Miniature Match Riles
with extra heavy barrel and B.S.A. Aperture Sight and you will
realise the truth of Mr. Copeland s assertion. Write for special
Martini Rifl i Booklet mentioning the name of your gun maker to

Maoriland's Most Drunken Theory.
The annual report of the M.L. Police Depart-
ment, presented to Parliament a few davs ago.
casts some more disrespect upon that Brumma-
gem temperance reform known as No-License.
Ihe statistics deal with all offences reported to the
OHN Hops for 12 months up to December last,
and show an aggregate net increase of 420 on the
gures for 1908, the increase being mostly con-
fined to the less serious brands of crime, such as
assaults, breaches of the peace, drunkenness, sly
grog-selling and vagrancy; whilst there has
been a steady decrease under the heading of
burglary (a crime which only a strictly sober man
can attempt with much hope of success), theft,
etc. In the 10 years from 1897 to 1907, the period
wlien JNo-License was rushed to the front as the
cure for drunkenness, the number of persons
charged with the offence just about doubled itself,
the figures being 5150 in 1897 and 10,288 in 1907.
And in 1909 there were 314 more persons prose-
cuted for drunkenness than in 190 S. Unfor-
tunately, the M.L. “Year Look forl9o9 ,> only
gives the figures up to 1907, but it is evident that
they are still growing. The crash of pubs
being thrown out of business resounded regularly
in 1899, 1902, 1905 and 1908, until in no less than 12
electorates the job of the licensed grog-distributer
had disappeared from the list of occupations.
Meanwhile, the perspiration and heat of putting
up hotel shutters resulted in an unprecedented
run on the liquor imported intoand manufactured
in Maoriland. Whereas in 1897 the consumption
per head of beer was 8'220 gals., of wineO'l46, and
of spirits 0‘663; in 1907 it had swelled to beer
10'150 gals., wine 0'159, and spirits 0 800. And
how much sly grog is sold nobody knows, or is
ever likely to know. A leading No-License
advocate at Wellington (M.L.) recently declared
in public that the illicit beer and the unlawful
whisky were blossoming like dandelions in Ash-
burton, and that about the only people who
couldn’t find them were the police. Anyhow, the
increase in the number of con victions for being
the illegal gardener who rears the grog-blossom
shows the spread of the noxious weed. In 1909
there were 235 prosecutions for sly-grog selling,
resulting in-154 con victions, against 158 prosecu-
tions and 127 convictions in 1908. Police
Commissioner Waldegrave, in his report to
Parliament, says: “The difficulty in obtaining evi-
dence in support of charges of sly-grog selling is
increased by the disinclination of the general public
to afford the police any assistance in this respect,
and for this reason it is found necessary to resort
to methods which are distasteful both to the
public and the police. There is, however, no
alternative, unless the law-breakers are to be
allowed to go their own way unchecked.” The
one bright virtue to be found in the whole pro-
ceedings is that the fines imposed on the sly-
groggist last year paid the cost of his capture and
trial and left a surplus of £1267 15s. 6d. But the
No-License policy is plainly a failure. What is
wanted is a No-Liquor policy.
♦
The stratagems of the rich monopolist in order to
increase his waist-measurement are many and
devious; and even the most anxious and hard-
working democratic Government can hardly keep
pace with them. A few years ago United States
farmers found that they had a good market for
their fat cattle in England. The freight across
was only some £2 per beast, and the business
began to grow. Then the Trusts took a hand in
the trade, and began to buy the farmers’ cattle
and send them to England. Some of the farmers,
however, kept on exporting their own live beef.
But one frosty morning these independent farmers
arrived at the wharf to find that all the space on
the transport vessels for the season had been “se-
cured ’’ by the Trusts. Further inquiry elicited the
fact that the independent farmers could get some
of the space—for the nominal charge of £slos. per
head. So, in one act, the independent shipment
of fat cattle to Bull’s country fell down and died.
In fact, the suddenness of its death constituted a
record. Now a loud and unpleasant rumor of
something much resembling the same animal can
be located at the principal Australian shipping
ports. Latterly, indeed, the noise has become
almost tangible enough to handle. The big men
have in many cases mopped up the storage room
for fruit, butter and meat on all the leading
liners; and the small man is lifting his voice in
indignant complaint. The complaint is one that
deserves investigation. The big men may claim,
perhaps, that they want all the space themselves ;
but it is going to be a bad thing for the Common-
wealth if the little man is smothered in the pro-
cess. O’Malley, of the Sombrero, could profit-
ably devote some of his energy to this matter, and
even if he lost his hat in the process, would be
money well spent.
♦
“ The Snake’s ” graphic account: —
Things will be very unpleasant on the Last Day—the
day on which the heavens shall pass away with a great
noise, and the elements shall melt with a fervent heat,
and all man’s works shall double up (including the Barren
Jack dam and Tait’s casual trains and Joe Ward’s collec-
tion of I O U’s and King O’Malley’s hat and even the
statue of Albert the Good). It is very difficult to get in-
formation as to what'will actually happen, but I reckon
it will work out something like this : There will be a
Sheol of an explosion ; the trams will stop, and all the
blokes at work will say “’Struth ! ” Then everything
will start to burn and crackle, and Satan will appear
on the Post Office tower and stop the clock.
All the people will be gathered together from the work-
shops and the mines and Paddy’s Market, and Fat will
dock their time. And a great fear will come upon
everybody ; and the pubs will do the business of their
lives. The girls won’t be aids to pass the bottles quick
enough ; the counter lunch will be pushed over ; and
cinnamon and odors, and wine and oil, and welsh rare-
bit and German sausage, and horned beasts, and souls of
men, and precious stones, and blue metal, and stink-
ing fish and devils will fight and curse on the floor
of the private bar. And the sea will roll the dead
up to Circular Quay, and Port Melbourne, and
Oriental Bay, and Cleveland and other popu-
lar resorts; and each deceased will come to life
and get a bend on as the spirit moves him—some for the
nearest hotel; some for the church ; some for the Regis-
trar to find out wfio their wives married. By this time
that old serpent which is the Devil will be getting his
chains bound on for 1000 years and bellowing in a great
voice for Houdini the Handcuff King to give him a lift.
(Thousands of pubs will now be blazing, and good beer
will be wasted shamefully.) The Resurrected will meet
old friends on the Block, and borrow an overcoat
or an umbrella. Some will borrow a bob. The mer-
chants of the earth will gnash their teeth, and
the Squiffy will walk with their beads held back.
(Millions of pubs will at this stage be on fire). ' Owing to
the sea‘being dried up the ferries will stop ; the distant
ships will roost on the bed of th<* ocean ; and the divers
will rush round to the second-hand shop to sell their hel-
mets and air-pumps. All bets will be declared off ; and
the wilderness will gibber at the gates of the cities. Then
will arise a great cry, “The Last Pub is on fire ; get yer
drinks quick!” And the inhabitants will fight at the
doorway, and struggle like 2,000,000 drowning devils.
Princes will offer all their wealth and their lands and their
wives for a long sleever ; the strong will upper-cut the' ;
.weak, and the weak will hamstring the strong with their
pocket-knives; the sound of corks being drawn and
casks busted will rise above the roar of flames, and Bung
will hang himself from the balcony. Black smoke will
envelope the proceedings ; the figure of the man who had
the Last Drink on Earth will be outlined for a moment
against the glare ; and death and Hell will go rocketing
to Oblivion.

“Phil Harum ” : Apropos of Wragge and
his prediction of drought (B. 21/7/TO). I met
the Inclement in the far west of Queens-
land in the early ’9o’s, and asked him how
far ahead he would care to forecast weather con"
ditions. He replied that he was not disposed,
with the data at his command, to go beyond 48
hours. A couple of years later, however, he
agreed to (and did) supply the Thunderer I was
running with a weekly forecast. When the Com-
monwealth came to pass, and Clement lost his
chance of being the first All-Australian Meteor-
ologist. the release from the bonds of official
harness sent him forecasting first into the next
year and then into the next decade. I expect to
hear of him issuing a forecast for next century
before long.
Australia may soon have cause to ponder
over the strong common-sense that Berlin has
shown. A local expert got his aeroplane going,
and flew brilliantly all over the city. He re-
ceived lots of applause, but when he came down
the city grabbed him, charged him with “im-
perilling the safety of the people,” and got him
fined £7 10s. If he had fallen, it was pointed out
to him, half-a-street-full of innocent people might
have been in the smash too ; he ought to practise
in waste places. If this theory is adopted gener-
ally, it seems to follow that' any air-craft ap-
pearing over a city will stand self-convicted of a
hostile intent, and can be shot at sight.

THE DESPAIR
OF
THE
DOCTORS
A Woman’s Six Months’ Terrible Martyrdom—
Could Not Retain Food—Lost 6 Stone in Weight—
Gradually Fading Away—Despaired of Recovery.
ER.Y typical of the hiartyrdom that many
women undergo to=day is the startling
story revealed by Mrs* Madge Usher* a
resident of 242 Palmer Street; Sydney, who says:—
“ A few years ago I was seized with a severe illness: My
stomach was itt such a weak state that everything 1 ate I
used td vomit. My health was completely shattered. 1 lost
6 Stone in Weight, and was hardly recognisable from my
former self. The inward pain I suffered from was terrible—
lio one could know what 1 went through—and I lost all
interest in everything*
** I went into the Hospital, where my case Wds the
despair of the doctors—they were completely baffled,
AlthougH they held several consultations over me, the
doctors were unable to come to an agreement on the
diagnosis Of my complaint; and to this day I do not know
the nature of the trouble 1 suffered from. Some of the
doctors said it was gastritis; others appendicitis* but they
Could not say for certain:
“ | was an inmate in the hospitals for six months, but
for all their treatment I was no better, 1 was under the care
of one of the doctors for five weeks* but his treatment*
instead of doing me good* Used to make me worse* and my
I
I
Mrs. M. Usher , who was com
plcteiy cured bij Bile Beans
husband had to take me away from the hospital* I practically gave iip all hope of recovery*
“ I had often heard of some of the miraculous cures effected by Bile Bearis* and it was
while' 1 was in the hospital that I first used them, but I had to take them secretly, so a£
not to let the authorities of the hospital know* 1 used to keep the Bile Beans tied up iii
the corner of my handkerchief. The doctors cbuld not understand why my bowels worked
so freely and regularly, and were completely puzzled, but i did not let them into the
secret that it was Bile Beans that was doing it. So on coming out of the hospital I
decided, as a last resource, to undergo a good course of Bile Beans, because, having
derived'a certain amount of benefit from them when I took them in the hospital, I felt
that they would do me more good if given a fair chance and allowed to work by them-
selves, without having other medicines to hinder them. I did not dream at that time that
I would owe my complete recovery to this great remedy—but it is so ; for with each
succeeding dose I felt a corresponding improvement in my condition. I began to mend
and pull together nicely. I felt the distressing symptoms leaving me, my weight began
to increase, my spirits revived, and after I had undergone a steady course of some six
boxes of Bile Beans I felt altogether a new woman. After my six long months of misery,
the world seemed brighter, living became a joy, and I was able to go about my duties as of
old—and it is to Bile Beans that my gratitude is due for working these incredible wonders
In me, and changing my life from that of sickness and grief to one of joy and happiness.
“ Yes, I am Indeed pleased to give you this testimonial out of gratitude for my won-
derful recovery, for it may be the means of pointing the way to others who may be the
victims of a similar serious illness to that which laid me low, to a reliable remedy. A
box of Bile Beans should be in every home.”

The Top of the Earth.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THIS is a song of the folly of man, who
gropes in the depths below,
He digs deep down as far as he can, in the
bottom-most stopes of woe.
With the pick and bar and the fuse and drill he
is gouging sadly now ;
He is chasing quartz for the hungry mill instead
of the useful plough !
With his air-compressor and timbered shaft he is
sinking down to Hell;
Oh, the ways of man, they ate sllrely daft, and as
cracked as an old tin bell 1
For the Top of the Earth hath a golden store that
awaiteth the gatherer’s hand ;
But the same old batteries clank and roar—heat
the curse of the angry Land !
They are sinking still on a hundred fields, from
the Towers unto Southern Cross;
And they seek in vain for the ancient yields and
they find but the same old loss 1
They are hoping hopes of a splendid lode, with a
yard of gold per ton,
But the Devil guffaws in his warm abode, for he
knows that the fields are done !
He can hear the picks on the roof of Hell as they
struggle with winze and stope,
And he laughs “Hal Ha!” when the flood
breaks in and drowneth the miner's hope.
For a water-jacket surrounds the Bit, and the
Devil exclaims, with mirth :
“Why don’t these sorrowful gougers quit and
inhabit the Top of the Earth ? ”
They are going down in the quest of gold, whilst
the surface waits untilled ;
So the shafts are sunk and the shots are “holed,”
and the Man with the Fuse is killed !
See the coroners sit on the mangled dead, hear the
sad shareholder’s groans—
But he thinks of the dividends that are fled, and
not of the broken bones !
For the Man with the Fuse is always cheap, and
is hired by the passing day;
And his kids may starve and his wife may weep
when he’s crushed ’neath rocks and clay.
So it seems to me that the world is mad, for the
Top of the Earth is fair ;
But they’re hewing down on a vain jehad, ’mid the
dust and the burning air.
They are sowing the seeds of dread disease, they
are dying in scores and scores ;
But they flee the sun and the crooning-trees, for
the winzes and stopes and bores.
From the springs below I hear the cry of the good
old earth and brown ;
But they slave where the useless crosscuts lie,
they are ever going down.
They are shattering quartz and bursting rocks,
and the stink of the ’fracteur fumes
Is the breath of a Devil who laughs and mocks as
he digs them their waiting tombs !
So I rather think that the world’s insane—it’s the
Top of the Earth for me.
Where the binder sings in the golden grain and
the blood runs warm with glee 1
They are stopped at last by the roaring flood that
spurts from the depths below ;
So the useless stamps must cease to thud, and the
Man with the Fuse must go !
And it’s all the same if he’s halt or lame —if he
crawls on the brink of death ;
He has drawn his pay, let him take his way—so
the law of a mad world saitli !
On the Top of the Earth there was room for him,
there was need for his strength and thew ;
And the Man with the Fuse faces hunger grim
when the Bottom of Things goes through !
The surface waits vnth its pregnant soil; but
the Devil is filled with mirth ;
In the reeking depths still the madmen toil—they
have fled from the Top of the Earth!

GRANT HERVEY.
The Yabby-Catcher.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
used to wonder why Bill was such
V t a “whale” for yabbies. Three times
a week, wet or dry, he would be down
at the dam below the, crushing shed, with
bits of string and meat-baits dangling from
the ends of the strings, and a billycan to put
the yabbies in when caught. He used to
vow that he couldn’t do without a “blow
out” -on the yellow, repulsive-looking insects at
least twice a week. When cooked, according to
Bill, they tasted like something between oyster
stew and scalloped whitebait. They certainly
ought to have had a distinctive flavor, for the dam
water was ’ used over and over again for the
crusher plates. It was pumped into the battery,
and after doing duty on the slimes during work-
ing hours ran back to the darn through a long
underground drain that started at the mouth of
the mine where, years before, the battery used to
stand.
During smoke-o one day, when the boss was
away at the assay office with the amalgam, Bill
produced a juvenile rat, and said he was going to
make a mate of it. For a lark he tied the end of
a ball of string to its tail, and put it in the drain
at the end next the mine. Then he closed that
end of the drain. Later he went down to the
dam end of the drain and recovered his pet, which
had had a wet passage. But Bill didn’t mind
that; what he did growl about, though, was the
loss of his twine, bought specially for cutting into
lengths for yabby lines. However, he never
brought the rat to work again.
Of course, there were changes in the shifts.
Men come and men go. Some go on grafting in
the same mine for ever if “ the cough ” doesn’t
take fihem. One chap who’d come on since last
pay joined our shift'to take the place of a man
who was too bad with “ the complaint ” to delve
again. He was a smart-looking, ferrety-faced
cove, and when he saw Bill marching off with his
lines and billycan to catch yabbies in the dam,
he said he also liked yabbies. In fact, where he
came from, in the city, they went every night to
the quarry-holes to catch a saucepanful for supper.
Bill didn't seem wildly enthusiastic about having
a mate at the game ; but there were more insects
than enough for two, and he couldn’t pretend that
he owned the dam. As Bill hadn’t any inorfe
string he loaned the stranger a lihe of tWo to
start With, but refused, however* to let hiin share
the billycan : ** Each hnatt has his own yabby-tin
in these parts,” said Bili, quite angry-like;
Wheh the stranger tried to set his lines off the
end of the battery drain Bill got filed, and asked
him if the damn dam wasn’t big enough Without
him trying to jump a mate’s claim.
Dynamite ohly laughed. We called the new-
comer “Dynamite” because he was so quick off
the mark. Why the manager didn’t put him on
the regular shift or on trucking puzzled us. Of
course, he hadn’t had much mining experience
Underground, though to hear him talk you’d think
he’d been at the delving game all his life. But
what riled us was the cocky way in Which he and
Bill lined Up to be searched when going off shift,
This searching business Was a new device. It
made us angry, and We Were just waiting an
opportunity to tell the manager so, as honest men,
When the dividends started to rise again, and so
many people said that it was wonderful how the
returns improved after the searching commenced
that we said nothing, For quite a while the man-
agement of the Goldeh Beetle Co, had warned us
that the shifts might be reduced any day, as the
returns were showing a shortage. Which was
queer, seeing that we were working rich stone.
In fact, in parts where Bill’s shift was working it
was like picking at a jeweller’s shop.
Bill became more engrossed in his yabbying
than ever, and his billycan was changed for one
twice the size. He had built a nice house, and
friends were coming up to a house-warming when
the verandah was painted. We all had invites to
the shivoo, except Dynamite. Bill’s friends liked
yabbies, he said, and as a host he was going to
give ’em a yabby salad such as they’d never
tackled before. So the big billycan and a dozen
lines were hard at work. Bill had to look to his
laurels, for Dynamite was becoming pretty expert
at landing the insects, and his bragging had
brought two or three other strangers, cronies
from the city, he said, to see him give Bill a run
for the best tally. One thing struck us as show-
ing that Bill didn’t take kindly to Dynamite’s
action in dipping into his yabby patch—he never
turned his billy load out to be counted, as his rival
did. One day one of the strangers lifted the lid
of Bill’s can just as he was landing a coupleof old
buck yabbies off one bait, and Bill did perform.
He gave the intruder a heap of his best language.
While he did it, another cove got nosing round
Bill’s favorite spot at the end of the box dram
through which the water trickled from the bat-
tery. Bill’s language was terrible then.
Bill always stopped till everyone had left, top-
ping up his billy with an extra dozen or so. But
this night neither Dynamite nor his friends
seemed inclined to go. Bill fished on, clinging to
his spot at the end of the drain like a king hang-
ing on to an unsafe throne, although the yabbies
were not biting at all well.
Then one man said it was time they quitted, as
it was getting late ; so Dynamite wound up his
lines with a scowl at Bill, and then got suddenly
mad and threw his kit, billy and all, into the
dam, and said he was tired of eating the blamed
insects.
Bill grinned at the prospect of having all the
yabbies to himself. Dynamite and his friends
left without saying as much as “Good night 1”
About 10 minutes later they sneaked back on
all fours, following the line of the drain. Bill
was down on his hands and knees beside the
drain, pulling up a line. It looked as though he
took a mighty long time over it. He had just
emptied his net into the billycan with a flop when
Dynamite’s paw was on his shoulder like a
“ demon’s,” and there was a new tone in his voice
as he said :
“Tip up that billycan, Stevens. Come, be
quick and lively ! ”
Bill shivered and turned green.
“ There’s only yabbies there, so help me ! ” he
stammered.
One of Dynamite’s friends tipped the can over,
and the released yabbies clambered for their
native element in dozens. Bill made no protest,
but half the contents of the can were specimen
gold. Next moment Bill was handcuffed. Then
Dynamite went down on his knees and started
feeling about in the water. After some time he
found that a long string ran right through the
drain with about 50 yards to spare, and a tin was
tied in the middle of it. Dynamite figured it out
that if a man put stolen gold into that tin at the
battery end of the drain, and shoved the tin into
the drain out of sight, he could then get searched
with a clear conscience. And if he happened,
later on, to be fishing for yabbies at the other end
of the drain, and hauled on the other end of the
string, the tin with the gold would come through
the drain nicely. The tin was nearly worn out
with being dragged back and forward through the
drain with stolen gold in it.
In the lockup Bill made a clean breast of it.
“I never ate a blessed yabby in me life,” he
told the watchhouse-keeper who took down his
statement. “It was only a blind so that I could
get the yellow stuff away in the billy. If I hadn’t
built that new caboose they’d never have smelt
even the rat I put through the drain to fix my
string ! ”
Bill got two years’ hard for gold-stealing.
Dynamite got promotion. He was one of the
smartest D.’s in the force, but he wasn’t sharp
enough. Bill’s house was searched from step to
roof without success. All they got back was the
lOoz. found in the yabby can.
* * * *
Bill lives in Europe somewhere now, and it’s
understood that he doesn’t need to work, either,
and never intends to as long as he lives. His wife
hangs out in a bark hut near the Golden Beetle
claim and takes in washing. It seems she wasn’t
really his wife. It was she who put him away ;
and she did it because, when Bill built the new
house, he wouldn’t put in the bow-window she
wanted. That made her mad. Somehow it
leaked out that she had done it, so Bill didn’t
take her with him when he retired from active
business after his term was up. He was sarcastic
about it, and gave her his old yabby can and a bit
of string to start afresh with. Then he fired her
out, sold the house, and left.

THE DANGER
of BACKACHE.
All tired out—scarcely enough
energy to get home in the
evening—no rest when you do
get home—as tired in the
morning as at night. The
back is so weak you can
scarcely bend it—aches and
throbs even when you lie still.
The kidneys are to blame.
They are not taking the
poisons out of the blood. They
need help, and need it at once.
Do not disregard the warning
message of" the back that
aches,for the ache comes from
the kidneys (which lie just
beneath the small of the <
back), and distinctly tells that
uric acid poisons and waste
matter are accumulating in
your body. These are" the
poisons that cause dropsy,

BACKACHE AND WEAK BACK CURED.
Mr. E. R. Davis, Proprietor Somerset Hotel, Station Street, Newtown,
Sydney, says “ I suffered for so long with backache and weak back that I
am pleased to tell other sufferers what will cure these distressing ailments.
My experience proves that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are the cure. My
back never ceased aching, and besides the pain and inconvenience, I was
afraid of more serious symptoms of kidney trouble developing. I tried
remedy after remedy, but it was only wasj;e of time and money, and I was
so disgusted with medicines for the kidneys that I would not have tried
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, but a friend told me they had cured him,
and urged nie to use them. lam glad I did, for two boxes cured me. This
did not happen yesterday, but four years'ago, and I am still free of the
backache. My lasting cure proves that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
permanently cure backache and weak back.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers

BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS
PILES CURED.
Mr. Edgar Wood, iron-turner, Rand-
wick Tram Line, whose private address
is 76 Cooper Street, Sydney, says :
“For seventeen years I suffered with
itching and protruding Piles. During
that time I was treated by several well-
known Sydney doctors. I also tried
chemists’ prescriptions, and used every
remedy advertised to cure this com-
plaint, but nothing gave me the
slightest relief. The irritation was so
great that it caused me annoyance and
inconvenience during the day, and kept
me awake for hours at night. I almost
despaired of ever getting anything to
relieve me, as I had experienced so
many failures. However, I saw an
article in the paper stating that Doan’s
Ointment had cured a well-known
Sydney man, who had suffered with this
complaint for twenty years. lat once
got this ointment, and am very pleased
to tell you that the first application
gave me relief. I continued using it
until I was perfectly cured. My cure
means a lot to me, and is wonderful
after suffering for seventeen years.
Since, my cure I have recommended
Doan’s Ointment to other sufferers, and
will always do so. I wish you to publish
this statement, so that people suffering
with Piles may know the value of
Doan’s Ointment.”
Mr. Wood says six years after the
above was given I am still free of
Piles. Doan’s Ointment made a perfect
cure in my cose, for I have been free of
Itching and Protruding Piles for the
past six years.”
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d per
pot, or will be posted on receipt of price by Poster McClellan Co 76 P l

The Door.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rHIS is a Ballad of Shadow. Under her
hated breath ,
A child in the dark hath questioned :
“My father, what is Death .? ”
From whence shall a man find answer? From
whom will he borrow speech,
Of a masked, dark Horseman riding the Hither-
ward way of Each ?
Who follows, and closer ever, that Never a One
may ride,
But he hears his Black Pursuer at the end gain to
his side ?
How shall a Man frame answer, who seeth his
friend cross o’er
The Bridge to the open postern, but seeth not
past the Door ?
He knoweth that all shall enter ; aye, even as He,
in turn,
Must pass with the sure black Hunter, in silence
and No-Return ?
This is the Ballad of Shadow ; nor symbol, nor
script, nor word
Shall utter its Further Secret, which none, save
the Dead, hath heard.
Not Wisdom from all her sources, nor Learning
in all her Chairs
Shall say what the Dead Man seeth who glassily
forward stares.
Ihe creeds of the world I questioned ; with ritual,
rite and sign
ilieir hierarchs loudly answered; from Egypt
and Palestine,
From Mecca and far Benares, where the creeds
hawk their brittle wares.
Each cried what the Dead Man seeth who, fixedly,
forward stares.
By each were the others scouted ; by all were the
others banned ;
dill the wrath of them fell like ashes, and the
worth of them lay like sand,
And my doubts were in no wise lessened, and
mine hunger in no wise fed
By tales of their rites and symbols, whose
Spirit had asked for Bread.
I he Books of the World I winnowed, and threshed
and winnowed again,
Till the husks rose like a whirlwind ; but little I
found of grain.
Nor prester nor poet filled me ; nor chemist, nor
sophist brought
d rom the bounds of the cosmic circle a centre to
place my Thought.
Past a thousand millions living and a million
millions dead,”
The Voice of My Reason murmured, “Is Life
like an arrow sped
I rom the bow of a Hidden Marksman, out of
the covered night ?
Into the closing Darkness, fast flieth His shaft of
Light.”
Ihen a wind from the Desert swept me. And out
of the skies a cloud
Encovered me as a cerement, that my feared Soul
groaned aloud.
By a weight of unmeasured Terrors was I heavily
pressed and worn,
That I grieved, in a sweat of anguish, the Hour in
which I was born.
I heard in the Dark their Voices: their numbers
were as the leaves,
The sands, or the stars of Heaven, the stalks of
the harvest sheaves ;
In the Night I saw their Faces—the People of
All this Earth
Since the First Man groaned in passing, till the
Last Child screamed at birth.
For the Hosts of the Dust were marshalled. Each
cried as they passed me by:
Such as I am shalt Thou be ! Such as thou
art was . . .
The knees of my courage quivered ; the bones of
me ached with dread,
Who saw in the Darkness crowding the forms of
the formless dead.
A wind from the Desert swept me, and out of the
Skies a cloud
Lay on me like a cerement, enfolded me as a
shroud.
The Sword of My Sins hung o’er me ; the Soul of
Me shrank and quailed,
The tower of my strength lay shattered, the
light of my Reason failed.
The mouth of me tasted Marah. Aye, into the
lowest dust,
Meseemed, by a Hand supernal, was I down, and
downward thrust;
Through a Night of aeons, endless. On my Body
sore afraid,
In darkness, ppaque and soundless, all deaths of
all ages laid.
So that my breath had failed me. Yea, e’en that
I stood before,
Soul willing, and yet unready, to pass through
the dreaded Door.
The end of the Passage faced me. But ever tne-
thought, I knew
On the thither side that portal a Great Light
surely grew !
A mandate of respite freed me. Back from that
Stygian stream
I walked with the feet uncertain of them who
have walked in dream.
And seeking my Vision’s meaning, fore-knowing
that nought may be
Of chance in the Plan Eternal, I saw at my feet
a key.
Lost from some hand unheeding, forgotten or
cast away,
This Key of an unknown portal in the dust
before me lay—
“A token of little moment, a trifle of gain or
loss,”
Methought, as I stooped to lift it. — And lo ! wp,s
niy Key a Cross.
Thi^2^r ot '^
Who march with the Living Legion and know in
m y heart I die,
Child, this is mine only message, uttered and
scribed apart —
Home Ke y of the Door is given to each, by his
inward Heart.

Sacrilege.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A SHOWER of white petals from the
ti-tree bloom at Sandringham. The bloom
of the wattle-gum over-arehing the track,
the leaves smothered in fluffy gold, scented, like
honey and roses mixed, and murmurous of bees.
Ihe flute of the magpie and the blackbird’s lilt.
By the sea, classic walks, as of an old wood in
ihessaly, fra jied by the beautiful forms of the
ti-tree and the gold of the bottle-brush wattle,
which is scented like roses and wine. Birds the
size of a big man’s thumb, filling the overloaded
bloom with harmony. The thorny wattle’s golden
worlds and their preponderating leaf, gold and
green on the one branch growing in amity.
All the symmetrical warped shafts of the ti-tree,
twisted by the south wind and the west wind,
breaking into bud. The delicate lettuce-green of
the new grass in the thickets. All the green of
the earth—sap, sage and magnolia. The sea
through the twisting avenues seen blue as the sky.
Where the ti-tree grows in belts a carpet as of new
spring in the old world—a spring of primrose and
nightingale, when
Amid the lush green grasses burned the red anemone.
Greens beautiful to the city-wearied eye. The
wholesome salt in the air from bared beaches
bringing back the sense of youth and the lust for
the open sea.
Distant Brighton, red and white and green at
the extremity of its sickled beach. The blues
and reds of bathing-boxes and tiled houses ; the
flat, yellow, iron rocks, and the shrieking gulls at
Picnic Point.
A little glade above Hampton Pier—a glade of
ti-tree was old before Bass and Flinders
found the Straits—beaten over and growing at
right-angles to the roots, but still tenacious of life.
The beauteous carpet starred with tiny flowers;
the prone ti-tree still blooming in the strength
won from stress, holding to life because the south
wind and the west wind have beaten life into
them so deeply.
The brown and morose trunks of ancient honey-
suckle trees, their magnolia green leaves lighted
by their golden lamps. From Picnic Point, yellow
sands and green shore swinging round to the red
and yellow cliffs of the Red Bluff and the crescent
of Half Moon Bay. And beyond Dromana, and
everywhere the spacious bay. Little plants in
the grass growing as if they would live for ever,
though they must die with the first summer heats.
A mournful she-oak sighing to the merest breath.
The sea birds slowly wheeling over the changing
shallows.
To this beauty eortles' the loud picnic of equal
numberS’Of both sexes. The nobler animals which
have drawn them hither are tied up and nose-
bagged. The picnic feeds itself to stertorousness
with ham, pigs’feet, pie and beer. When it can
eat no more the female half of it throws frag-
ments of pigs’ feet and ham at its male comple-
ment, and this being taken as an invitation to the
love-chase, there are excursions and alarums
through the glades and the avenues of bloom.
Later, the stuffed picnic prompts a miscreant
with an accordion to drown the voice of the black-
bird, and all parties concerned dance with much
noise and intendedly-humorous slappings of one
another—mostly on the back. At last the night
brings sanctity back to the trees. There is left to
mark the sacrilege only 1000 flapping newspapers
stained with ham-grease, 100 meat tins, and 500
bottles.
If it be a picnic of the righteous the bottles are
there just the same, but they are ginger ale
bottles, and the newspapers know less ham stain
and more cake crumb. The righteous picnic does
not dance, nor has it an accordion ; but it also
throws its food at its fellow when surfeited, and
disguises the love chase with a pretension of
athletics. Its amusements tend to keep the
brothers and sisters together. Kiss-in-the-ring is
made Arcadian. The intimate touches of hunt-
the-slipper are supposed to have a bearing on the
conversion of the heathen savage from darkness
to light. They are, in some sort, an attempt at
working for the missionary who endeavors to pre-
vent the heathen prancing naked on the coral
shore.
But there comes to all this beauty a worse thing
than.these. It is a revivalist picnic. A revivalist
picnic is much more venomous than the other
kind, because Revivalism, having no fixed
government like the other score or hundred of
sects, it is less respectable in its dulness and not
nearly so formal when it howls. Mystery becomes
confusion because every unit of a “revival”
works on its own. A score talk together and all
of them say “Amen ” in the wrong place.
They come by rail and road, per cab, per
bicycle and per boot. They are almost alwavs as
ugly as the Sin they condemn. The male revi-
valist is either a soured and afraid and thin old
man, or a greasy bull-necked saint who looks like
a butcher.
The day saw them coming, and all the beauty
shivered at their hideously black clothes, their
beefy legs in black tubes like sections of stove
pipe, their stub-toed, low-heeled, squeakful boots.
In that green cathedral they chatter and sing
and whimperasmonkeysmightdoif half-drunken.
Silence, except for the champing of 500 saintly
jaws, comes only when they feed. And then
“ Neow, my frien’s, we will sing a yim ! ”
The hymn is always about Blood. They sing
it wi'-h a ferocity they believe to be devotional
fervor- with the ferocity born of the great meal
°‘ pork. 'And then through all the
golden noon the sacred grove is insulted with
noise and mental besottedness, and in the end
they go away and leave more newspapers on the I
beach. The Salvation Army picnic is like this,
only that it is.noisier and eats less pork.
The winter hides all these fouling agents, and
spring breaks clean in green and gold. But the
summer will bring them again in all their horror,
to commit a new sacrilege in the sanctuary. And
I object. Let the extra righteous howl among
galvanised iron and mean streets.

PUBLIC OPINION
is generally sane anil trustworthy. It is only on really insignifi-
cant and unimportant matters that the sense of the community is
ever at fault. The sentiments and opinions of the world are more
likely to be right than those of the isolated critic. This is partic-
ularly true of such matters as must be decided by the test of expe-
rience. What the majority have proved in practice to be true
ought to weigh with us as an established fact. Now if there is one
question more than another on which public opinion is unanimous
it is that the excellence of BEECHAM’S PILLS as a family medi-
cine is unsurpassed. Their universal popularity has very suitably
been expressed in the world-famed expression
BEECHAM’S
PILLS
ARE WORTH A GUINEA A BOX.
Prepared only by THOMAS BBBCHAM, St. Helens, Lancashire.
Sold everywhere in boxes, price ///.V {56 pi'ls) & 219 (168 pills).
Is your Liver right?
It’s one thing tp feel well and bright and happy, and
another to have a sluggish liver. A sluggish liver positively
kills enjoyment. 'You cannot even rest, sleep or eat comfortably.
But you would after a Cockle’s Antibilious Pill, for Cockle’s Pills
liven the liver and give it strength to do its work. Used for over 100
years and still prescribed by physicians and preferred by the public
throughout the world.
