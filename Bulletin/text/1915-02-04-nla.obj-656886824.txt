Fiction.
In What Will People Say? (Harper, per
Dymock’s Library), a novel that rather
overpoweringly exudes the aroma of sex,
Robert Bridges opens up an interesting
question or two. His hero, returning from
the Philippines, is struck by the flaunting
challenge of New York’s society women.
“All these women are paid fot by men. For
everything that every one of these women
wears some man has paid.... The men who
pay for these things are not here: they are
m their offices or shops or at their tasks
somewhere, building, producing; or in their
graves resting from their labors, while th
spendthrift sex gads abroad squandering anc
flaunting what it has wheedled; What do
these women give in return? They musi
pay something. What do they pay?”
Forbes is a poor lieutenant in the toy
army of the U.S.A. He falls in love witi
Perns, and Persis belongs to the Smart Set
”he gallops with the rich runaways. Their
life is one long stampede.” And Persis is
always thinking of what other people woulc
think. Hughes knows his idle N’York rich
ms society” pictures are painted with
brutal realism. Persis, who loves Forbes, is
too clever to marry a poor man. She sells
herself into slavery, as a Mrs. Millionaire
with a cynical cheerfulness. Forbes gets
the answer to his question. “These women
.... paid with their bodies, their kisses, the
encircling of arms, the cooing of tender
words. In return for so much money they
granted permission to spend yet more.” And
.L ersis has an ingenious answer to Forbes’s
indignation. Men will sacrifice everything
for their career. Well, why shouldn’t women
and a woman’s career is marriage?
But Persis, having made her bargain, will
not pay. And the end is a sordid tragedy
in which Persis is murdered by her feeble
little, enormously rich husband, a weak
character capably and even sympathetically
drawn. Another exposure, if exposure is
needed, of the selfish, cold-blooded heroine
of modern U.S. fiction—and probably of
fife. What Will People Say? just misses
being a great novel: it is too seductively
luscious.
Algernon Blackwood grows a trifle tedious.
His latest collection of stories of. the spook-
world, Incredible Adventures (Macmillan)
is incredible enough, but his art is occasion-
ally ineffective. He fails quite to create his
magic: one has. an uneasy suspicion that one
is reading fiction. His ghosts are merely
spooks. Not that he is gauche enough to
deal in ordinary spooltery: his ghosts are
forces, like fire and mystical
Iheys and dead Egypt and the reincarna-
taon of forgotten ages. And when he uses
the haunted house motif he is not content
0 .... ave haunted by one ghost, but by
millions. 8ut....0ne does not quite be-
lieve —as one believed in Jimbo and The
Centaur, as he made one willing to believe
m those, triumphs of the mystic. And his
method is too discursive; there are pages
of “The Regeneration of Lord Ernie” that
grow wearisome simply because of the over-
elaboration of his description.
‘‘The Damned” is a cheerful conception.
A house is haunted by Hell. The millions
of the damned are trying to get out—evi-
dently the door is somewhere in the cellar.
There is a reason for the trouble. The house
is haunted by the thought and belief that its
former inhabitants had left behind. It is
haunted by a succession of dour intolerances.
‘The site on which this modern house now
stands was Roman, before that Early
Britain, before that again, Druid. The older
building that Franklyn altered and practi-
cally pulled down was a monastery; but
before he came here the house was occu-
pied by Manetti, a violent Catholic without
tolerance or vision; and in the interval be-
tween these two, Julius Weinbaum had it,
Hebrew of the most rigid type imaginable.
Each in turn has left his layer of con-
centrated thinking and belief behind him;
because each believed intensely, absolutely,
beyond the least weakening of any doubt —
the kind of strong belief and thinking that
is rare anywhere to-day, the kind that wills,
impregnates objects, saturates the atmo-
sphere, haunts, in a word. And each, be-
lieving he was utterly right, damned with
equally positive conviction the rest of the
world. One and all preached that implicitly
if not explicitly. It’s the root of every creed.
Last of the bigoted, grim series came Samuel
Franklyn.”
The house was haunted by generation after
generation of wowsers. The concentrated
essence of woWserism saturated the whole
place. But, as one character sisked: “Why
does nothing ever happen? A place so
thickly haunted ought to produce a crop of
no ordinary results!”
There were so many varieties of wowsers,
layer on layer, each in turn damning all the
others, that the final effect was merely to
keep -Hell in a ferment and prevent any
variety of wowserism getting a real work-
ing majority. Hence Hell could not do much
harm. “The thought and belief of each occu-
pant m turn kept all the others under. They
gave no sign. of . life at the time. But the
results of thinking never die. They crop
out again the moment there’s an ope.ning.
And with the return of Mabel in her nega-
tive state, believing nothing positive herself,
the place for the nrst time found itself free
to reproduce its buried stores. Damnation,
hell-fire and the rest —the most permanent
and vital thought of all those creeds, since
it was applied to the majority of the world
—broke loose again, for there was no re-
straint to hold it back... .The place is satur-
ated by that appalling stream of thinking—
the terror of the damned. It concentrated
upon Mabel, whose negative attitude fur-
nished the channel of deliverance. Nothing
happened, because no one layer could ever
gain the supremacy.”
However, things nearly, very nearly, hap-
pened. Mabel and her guests heard the doors
of Hell open and shut, and they heard
another awful thing: they heard “weeping
and gnashing of teeth”! Blackwood is to
be congratulated upon having made a horror
of that gnashing. Not only did they hear
it, but gentle Mabel started gnashing her-
self. “I am not sure that it was a sound I
had ever heard before, though children, I
half-remembered, made it sometimes in blind
rages when they knew not what they did.
In a grown-up person certainly I had never
known it. I associated it with animals
rather—horribly. In the history of the
world, no doubt, it has been common enough,
alas; but, fortunately, to-day there can be
few who know it, or would recognise it even
when heard.”
Only in this story does Algernon Black-
wood get his convincing shudder; and he
finishes the story, with admirable art, with
the conventional happy ending. It is a
good, satisfying gnash.
d*
. “I knew an old man in Connaught one
time, and he was a great lad for the stories.
If that man was to break off in the middle
of a tale the neople would stand up and kill
him, they would so. He would tell you a
story about nothing at all, and you’d listen
to him with your mouth open, and you
afraid he would come to the end of it soon,
and maybe it would be nothing more than
the tale of how a white hen laid a brown
egg. He would tell you a thing you knew
all your life, and you would think it was a
new thing. There was no old age in that
man’s mind, and that’s the secret of story-
telling.”
That is one secret of story-telling: the
other is to be James Stephens. His new
novel, The Demi-Gods (Macmillan), is
merely a story, but there is in it something
more than white hens and brown eggs. But
there is no need to analyse The Demi-Gods;
for James Stephens takes so huge a delight
in the telling of the wanderings in Ireland of
Patsy and Mary Mac Cann and the “three
big buck angels” and the donkey, that he
carries the reader’s critical faculties hilari-
ously away with him. If Stephens assures
you that three big buck angels did alight in
Ireland and that they had detachable wings
and haloes, you accept his statement just as
the ass did. Delightful personages these
angels, especially the one called Art, And
the donkey is just as human as the arch-
angel—but more sensible. And the story
is as extravagant as his heroes. Yet it is
no rollicking odyssey; it is full of human
tenderness and pathos, and its glittering tex-
ture is shot through and through with wis-
dom and humor. James Stephens’ novels
are like no other novels. You may think
them silly, you may know them wise; but if
you are wise you will read them.
And into this fantastic plot stray real
people with their real tragedies. There
is Eileen Ni Cooley, “a bad woman,” a mem-
ber of a very old profession, who is yet
to be pitied—-and loved. And there is that
bad man, Brien O’Brien, who got thrown
out of. Hell, together with the Seraph, owing
to their historic dispute over a stolen three-
penny bit. James has told that tremen-
dous story before: here we meet the actual
characters in it, and learn of their aston-
ising adventures after hitting the earth,
“just outside the village of Donnybrook
where the back road runs to the hills.” And
it turns out that one of the big buck angels
is Patsy Mac Cann’s Guardian Angel—and
Patsy had been making his Guardian Angel
“drunk every second night in the little
pubs!”'. However, the Guardian Angel de-
nies this. He states that it would have
taken more than Patsy to make him drunk.
And, engrossed in these miracles, the reader
never notices that, all through, Mary had
never had speech with Art, the youngest of
the. angels. But over the fire, one night, in
their eyes love is born, sex is born, and then:
“She could not think, she could not try to
think, that was her stillness ; but she could
feel and that was her movement: she was
no longer a woman but a responsiveness.”
And there is the final scene, where Art, the
youngest of the angels, renounces his celes-
tial glories—-and, incidentally, his loose'
halo and his detachable wings—for the
beauty of Mary Mac Cann.
The Glean Heart, by A. S. M. Hutchinson
(Hodder and Stoughton, per Dymock’s
Library), is a fine successor to The Happy
Warrior. It is the genuine open-air novel, as
contrasted with the popular fakes by Jeffery
Farnol.. Philip Wriford is a successful
journalist and author, who all his young life
had overworked in the ultimately successful
effort to provide for his dependents, simply
because he had not the pluck to shake him-
self free from their tyranny. And he never
took a holiday—never had the courage to.
The inevitable consequence was a nervous
breakdown. Hutchinson paints a graphic pic-
ture of Wriford. the editor sending his weekly
to press, conscientiously satisfying himself
that every line in it was just as he wanted
it, worried almost to madness, yet too weak
to delegate an atom of his own authority to
his subordinates, somehow “pulling through,”
spent, sick, nerveless, and then “beginning to
think of going home and beginning to think
of the task of taking down his coat from
behind the door and of the task of getting
into it. He began to think of the paper that
had just gone to_ press, and*began in his mind
to go slowly through it from the first page,
enumerating the title of each article and
each picture. Somewhere after half a dozen
pages he would lose the thread and find him-
self miles away occupied with some other
incident, then he would start again “A
picture that will appeal to the heart—or
whatever it is he has got—of every sub-
editor.'
So Wriford goes mad, attempts to drown
himself, and, being unwillingly rescued, flees
raving from himself—his other self. Some-
how he finds himself out in the country, and
meets Puddlebox. Puddlebox, as grotesque a
character as his name, takes kindly to the
looney; and the two start on their adven-
tures. And they are adventures! Quite
purposeless, since the only way that Wriford
can escape his other self is to dare his spook
to follow him in the maddest escapades. It
is only by. torturing his body that Wriford
can give his brain a rest: his madness com-
pels him to-incessant physical activity. But
an end comes to this phrase, marked by the
death of the grotesque Puddlebox. At times
this gentleman seems too obviously a liter-
ary creation; but the author cunningly re-
stores his caricature to humanity by the
nobility of his death. Wriford has a long
and dreary convalescence, during which he
puzzles over; the appalling fact that he has
lost the capacity for happiness.
“In the old days he had been slave of his
brain, hounded by his brain. He had cast
that away. He had escaped from it. In the
new he had turned for joy of living to his
body, and had mastered his body and all his
fears and all his thoughts. He had lived
through two lives—life that was not his own,
but given to others; life that was all his own
and to none but himself belonged. Fruitless
both. Was there some secret of happiness
that he had missed?” Yet Puddlebox had
been happy. Had Puddlebox some quality
unknown to him? You see, Wriford had
not come to a recognition of the meaning of
the fact that Puddlebox had given his life ’to
save Wriford. It was necessary for Wriford
to learn again, and more bitterly, the mean-
ing of sacrifice. So Wriford meets Essie—
one of the most delightful feminine creations
in recent literature. Essie is real, whereas
Puddlebox never quite escaped from litera-
ture into life.
The story of the new Wriford, slowly
learning the meaning of unselfishness as a
master of a boys’ school, and as slowly learn-
ing the meaning of Essie, is the most charm-
ing portion of an otherwise too hard and too
intellectually brilliant a novel. And in the
end .it is Essie’s tremendous, but hardly
credible, sacrifice for him that restores him
to himself, cured of his ingrained egoism.
Yet here, too, Hutchinson strains the credu-
lity of his sympathetic reader. Essie he left
under sentence of death, and returned to
London, to take up his work again, without
attempting to find out whether she had lived
or died. It is true that he had made a vow
to himself: he regarded this trial as an expi-
ation, £s a contract with God. But he loved
Essie, and Essie loved him. And none of
Hutchinson’s readers could have been so cal-
lous about Essie; and Hutchinson cannot
persuade us that Wriford could have been
so inhuman, even if still mad. It looks, to
the hardened fiction-reader, as if the author
had imposed this condition on Wriford
merely to achieve his tremendous climax.
And that is a sin against literature.
There is in The Glean Heart a similar
moral to that of W. B. Maxwell’s In Cotton
Wool. Both fine novels deal with an exag-
gerated egoism, and both lead to madness.
Let Wriford speak: “All my life from the
beginning has been self. Back in the London
days when I was working day and night,
when I was longing to be free, when I
thought I was giving up my life to others,
it was all self, self that was destroying me.
It was not ceaseless work that wrought upon
my peace of mind, robbed me of my youth—
it was pitying myself, thinking of myself,
contrasting my lot with that of others. It is
not work nor trouble that kills a man, robs
him of sleep, loses him his happiness—it is
turning the stress of it inwards upon himself,
never forgetting himself when occupied with
it, always keeping himself before his eyes,
watching himself, pitying himself. .. .1
thought I was sacrificing my life—l was
grudging every moment of it given away
from my own pursuits. How could I be
sacrificing when in doing so I was unhappy?
.... To give—to give time, money, life itself,
and have compassion for oneself in giving
them, that is the very pit of self, worse than
self open and wilful.”
A fine, clean book, full of life and its
iridescent humor, yet a little overlaid by
literary artifice, a little too full of affecta-
tions of style. But, in every sense, worth
while—an achievement.
•
The Australasian Photo-Review
(Kodak, C. A. 4d. monthly, edited by
Walter Burke) opens the new year with an
entirely Australasian issue, all the articles
being contributed by Australian camera-
workers. The success of the experiment,
late though it is in the history of this estab-
lished journal, should be sufficient encourage-
ment for a much more liberal Australasian
flavor in its future issues. But the usual
exception must be taken to the statement
that this is its first “colonial” number.
“S.T.S.”: “Red Page” says that Wells’s
new novel ends with Lady HaTman “slam-
ming the door of the modern Doll’s House—
marriage” (though she may surrender to
some more masculine suitor later). Can’t see
the facts that way. The delightfully Meredith-
ian scene in which she pursues the gentle
Brumley through the woodland, and ends by
kissing him, seems to me to imply
that she abandons her claim to free-
dom, and accepts him in the most
practical way. Evidently the ingenious
Wells has devised a “Lady or Tiger?” finish;
for a critic like the “Red Page” can take it
as a “Doll’s House” ending, while the vast
majority, preferring Happy endings to a
story, will certainly accept this as being one.
The Writing on the Back-yard
Fence
Like the war, it has been a long time
coming, but now that it has come it is
awful. The Paralysis of a Nation, “a Candid
Indictment of the Policy, the Methods and
the Morale of the Labor-Socialist Party of
Australia,” by. Bruce Smith (The Liberal
Association of N.S.W.), draws the serious
attention of Australians to “the origin,
growth and steady development of a political
disease that has come to Australia from the
revolutionary hotbeds of Europe, and which,
if not treated promptly and drastically, as
we treat leprosy, small-pox and other foul
diseases in the human body, will in a short
time overwhelm the body-politic of our
otherwise fair land, and end in veritable re-
volution.” There! It is not as if we had
not been warned- Bruce Smith states that
even in 1887 he saw the approach of the
Socialistic Tiger, and publicly proclaimed
the. coming present dire condition of things.
It is a terrific indictment, before which the
horrors of the war pale. It was in 1890
that “there were sown upon the fair land of
Australia the seeds of a fell disease: a verit-
able social and political malady, which has
spread from year to year like an orchard
pest, sapping the people’s traditional love of
freedom, undermining their reverence for the
high conditions of peace, order and good
government, which had grown up and pre-
vailed among their progenitors for a thou-
sand years, and striking at the root of the
mutual goodwill that had hitherto existed
between the various clases that go to make
every truly progressive community.”
By the year 1902 “the paralysing policy of
Socialism had become the (Labor) party’s
openly-accepted creed; and the party has
since spread its baneful influence over a
wider and wider field, by the gradual de-
moralisation of all those to whom they have
communicated their infectious moral
malady.” Painful, indeed; but there is
worse to follow. “To such an extent has
this reckless and selfish disregard for the
rights and liberties of civilised persons been
carried, that the children of Pacific Island
laborers—brought into the community for
its own commercial purposes—who had been
schooled amid our civilised conditions, edu-
cated -and Christianised in our public schools,
and nurtured in the manners and customs
of our British conventions, have been
ruthlessly forced to leave their homes
and the country of their birth, and
submit to tie carried, against their will,
back to the islands of their savage ancestors,
and there to be left to the brutal conditions
and surroundings of a barbarous people,
probably.to.be gradually dragged down to
the uncivilised, heathenish and immoral
level of the native islanders.” Well, Bruce'
Smith might have saved at least one of
these bright, civilised, Christianised kiddies,
by adopting it into Ms own family, and
bringing it up, nurtured in the manners and
customs of our British conventions, pro-
bably to the fulfilment of a brilliant politi-
cal career as the heir and successor of
Bruce Smith. And deeply it pains this page
to hear the champion of the mottled and
varnished races speak of them as “heathenish
and immoral.”
The outlook for Australia is hopeless.
The Labor Party will writhe helplessly be-
neath this scathing indictment. A whole
chapter is given up to his charges; no less
than 32 paragraphs begin with these words
of doom: “I charge the Labor Party with
. ...” A sample will be sufficient : “I charge
them with ingratitude to the mother country,
and with ignoring Australia’s Imperial obli-
gation, by refusing in 1903 to contribute a
miserable pittance of £200,000 a year to the
up-keep of the British Navy; and with re-
fusing to equip Australia to assist in the de-
fence of the whole Empire, upon which the
safety of Australia depends, until con-
strained to do so, later, on political grounds,
by the force of loyal public opinion.”
Amazing! Bruce Smith remains the sole
survivor of the Prehistoric Tory; he is
thoroughly consistent: he has never moved
one inch from his early convictions; and he
is. the only Tory who has stood steadfast in
his proud prejudices, rejecting, or oblivious
to, the evidences of Socialism in his own
mother-country—the dreadful Socialistic
legislation of Lloyd George.

Self-Loading Shotgun, 12 Gauge
The Winchester Model 1911 Self-Loader is a wild-fowl gun par excellence. The
recoil ejects the fired shell, feeds a loaded shell from the magazine into the
chamber, cocks the hammer and leaves the gun ready to be fired again. In wild-
fowl shooting, the game often comes fast and when least expected. Shoot a
Winchester Self-Loader and you can always be prepared for a series of shots; for
the loading and firing of this gun are controlled by the trigger finger. As the re-
coil of this gun is used to operate the reloading mechanism, the “kick” of heavy
loads is minimized, making the gun very pleasant to shoot. It is a hammerless,
two-part, take-down, five-shot repeater, that works well with all standard loads.
The working parts being made of Nickel steel, make it strong and safe.
Ask your dealer to show you the Winchester that’s
LOADED BY RECOIL, CONTROLLED BY THE FINGER TRIGGER.

A WOMAN’S BIRTHRIGHT!
A CORRECTLY
BUST!
Every woman can have a perfect figure. A deficiency in bust is
readily corrected by Du. Falmere’s Flesii-Food treatment. The best
evidence is that of those who have used it. It is never-failing. See
what MRS. K. WINGROVE, of Gympie, Queensland, a skilled nurse,
says of its efficacy:—
“After leaving off your treatment I waited several months
to see if the results were permanent before writing you, and
1 now wish to say that I think the treatment is absolutely
marvellous. Hefore adopting it I was only skiri and bones,
hut now I am one of the best walking advertisements you
could have. It did all you claimed for it and really more,
and the results were startlingly ahead of my fondest expec-
tations. Jly health and appearance have improved most
satisfactorily, and I now thank you for urging me to have
the treatment.”
We haven’t room to give you more letters here like this one, but vve will send you scores of
them upon request. We possess thousands of grateful testimonials.
Many cases gain as much as 51b. a week, and improvements up to as much as ten inches
have been made in the bust measurements. Guarantee given in every case.
Put up in tablet form, it is pleasant to take, and palatable. It leaves no unpleasant after-
effects, and the results are permanent and lasting. It can be taken secretly. .

A Hot Night.
A night so hot the very shadows sweltered
From the late rage of an appalling sun.
The earth seemed burned with fire, the grey
boughs sheltered
No cool, sweet spot from that wide torment
won.
Tasting the bitter of that evil hour,
All hearts seemed dust and all ill things had
power.
’Twas then we spoke. The fruit was parched
and rotten
That in its ripening gave a promise fair;
The things said could never be for-
gotten—
Mad sounds upon the hot and stagnant air.
The taint of that vile evening must remain
Eating our hearts through twilights sweet
with rain.
On life’s strong wind we float as floats a
feather.
The thistledown has purpose strong as ours;
Fate with her blowpipe breathes upon the
weather,
And dry and sere are all the soul’s best
flowers.
Had the thermometer dropped five degrees
Our words, remembered still, might soothe
and please.

The Three Calls.
The soft snow drifted down the creek
And swirled beneath the broken bridge;
The shadows played at hide-and-seek,
Among the trees on Charlie’s Ridge.
Across the moon there swept a cloud,
The moon herself was pale and cold
As any dead thing wrapped in shroud
For burial in grave-yard mould.
There is a bird that calls at night,
Along the reedy water ways.
A lost soul, calling vainly, might
A note of equal anguish raise.
And thrice across the burthened creek,
And thrice across the broken bridge,
While shadows played at hide-and-seek,
The Curlew called from Charlie’s Ridge.
I watched the sleeper on his bed.
He breathed indeed, a troubled breath—-
I think his dreams were of the Dead,
Of Death or, maybe, After-Death.
A second time the curlew called
(Called ever bird in such distress ?),
And then, as one enchained and thralled,
He rose and waited motionless.
The world outside was bright as noon —
The dead trees gleaming, row on row,
Unchequered in the sky the moon
Lit up the newly-fallen snow.
Where, months before, red fires had sped
There lay a burnt and blasted track,
And through the soft snow, whitely-spread.
The prone logs thrust their startling black.
It was a strangely-muted hour,
And silence reigned o’er earth and air;
It seemed as if some mystic Power
Had made a stillness everywhere.
’Twas such a hushed and haunted scene,
As one in ’wildering dreams might dree,
When, ears alert, he needs must lean
In cold, acute expectancy.
Or, maybe, some relentless sin
Stood dominant with deathless guilt,
The while the moonlight creeping in
Lay in chill pools upon his quilt.
When came the. first call down the night
(Called ever bird so hauntingly?)
He woke, and in the icy light
His dark eyes were a hurt to see.
For, like the eyes of one nigh-rlead,
Their depths were wild with fierce appeal.
And dread beyond the worst of dread
That, till that hour, ’tis ours to feel.
The world outside was bright as day,
And white the serried trees and stark;
Snow-weighted somewhere, far away
A limb fell crashing in the dark.
It woke an echo in the rocks.
It made the prowling dingo howl;
I heard the barking of a fox,
The hooting of a hooded owl.
And then the curlew called once more
(Called ever bird in such a wise?).
He took three paces down the floor
With out-thrust arms and staring eyes.
Three paces down the floor he took —-
The chill snow gleamed on bank and
bridge—•
He looked fas one who fears to look)
Across the creek to Charlie’s Ridge.
Ilis breath upon the window-pane
(He standing nigh it hollow-eyed)
Ran down and down like drops of rain
Or tears that will not be denied.
What ailed his thoughts I cannot tell,
The Thing he saw I did not see;
But this I know, and know full well,
It was not rock, nor stone, nor tree.
Perchance, if I had but his eyes
(How dark they were and fixed and wide !)
Then had I seen a dead man rise
With red blood gushing from his side.
And, maybe, I, too, visioned thus —
And standing in the icy light,
With yielding limbs leaf-tremulous —
Would stare and stare into the night!

Now, there is no pretence that Australia cannot make rope, twines, etc., and the Fisher Government would promptly stop these foreign factory hands as undesirable

SERVING SHORT INJUNCTION ON
THE GERHOG.
The great war, which has been ferocious
enough in the past, doesn’t improve as time
goes on. The chief sufferer, of course, is
Belgium. That prosperous little State
struggled hard to keep out of the tiouble.
It meddled in no European complications.
It attacked nobody; in fact, it was so
peaceful that its Constitution forbade it to
make war on anybody, though it might
protect itself if assailed. It maintained not
a single warship, cruiser, gunboat, armed
punt or other means of offence at sea. . Its
army was fairly efficient, but it was liable
to serve in home defence only. -The
neutrality of its territory was guaranteed
by the Great Powers of Europe, and by
almost everybody except the Shak:speake
Society and the Baptist Conference. It
was 81 years previous to the outbreak ot
the present trouble since any Belgian soldier
fired a shot in anger upon European soil,
and even 81 years ago he was, as usual,
fighting on his own territory. When the
temporary union of Holland and Belgium
broke up, a philanthropic set of Powers
took a hand in refixing things—some of the
Powers were very philanthropic, and ideal-
istic in those days, for the Russian theories
of the Holy Alliance weren’t quite forgotten
—and resolved to establish, before the
bloodshot eye of all the world, the beautiful
spectacle of a progressive monarchy where
tranquillitv was fixed and assured and nailed
down. It was a Quaker experiment, com-
pared with which Pennsylvania was a not.
Belgium fell in because it refused to break
all the pledges and agreements under which
the kingdom was established, and allow its
territory to be used as the military stamp-
ing ground of the Gerhog, who had specially
pledged himself to respect its neutrality.
And it committed a sin which is beyond all
pardon, because its armies held up the
Kaiser’s legions for 14 days, and thus dis-
arranged the time-table of God’s senior
partner beyond repair. # #
The doings of the Gerhog in Belgium —
the rape and torture and mutilation, the
wholesale murder and wholesale destruction,
the use of Belgian women and children as a
rover for the invader’s troops, the levying
of contributions which have left the country
almost without a crust or a cent, the wiping
nut of manufactures and agncultuie, the
impressment of the people to dig trenches
for the Prussians, and to bury the Prussian
dead, and even to serve in the Prussian
armies—would seem incredible if the
Kaiser’s own bad characters hadn’t supplied
such abundant evidence of their truth. For
years Germany has had an output of mili-
tary books which broadly hinted _ that old
Fatherland, having a divine mission to
govern the world, wasn’t bound by the
ordinary rules of war. It was laid down
as a sort of principle that Germany wasn’t
quite human, but was almost divine. And
the idea that Germany isn’t quite human
begins to eat into the European conscience.
Belgium—-or at least the greater part of
that unfortunate country —is Germany’s one
conquest. No country ever suffered more
since the days of the Huns, and even the
Hun—-with his broad nose, and his _ greasy
mane, and his squat figure, and his long
arms, and his short legs, and his general
aspect of being an ape—hardly did worse
damage. The position of the Belgian now,
in the provinces that are under Gerhog
control, is interesting as the result of a great
experiment in the way of peace and inoffen-
siveness. Those of him who remain can
only leave the country by stealth. If they
get away they depart as paupers, and have
to ask foreign peoples for a crust and a bed.
Their industries are obliterated. They pass
here and there by surreptitious by-ways,
because on the high-roads they are liable
to meet Gerhog officers and soldiers who
search men and women on the off-chance
that there may be in their possession some
stray coppers which have escaped the
collectors of contributions. Around Brussels
some 500,000 people are reported as slowly
dying of starvation —equal to one-fourteenth
of the whole population of the kingdom as
it was before the war. And it is now inti-
mated that the sale of food may be entirely
stopped, so that whatever remains may
serve for the furnishing of the Gerhog
forces. Apparently, unless stronger assist-
ance comes at an early date, there will be
something like an end of Belgium—the
State whose only offence was that it stood
in the way of Gerhog ambition. As the
very bad poet Montgomery alleged on
another occasion, thpre will be “a blank
among the works of God.”
Those people who are in the thick of the
misery begin to wonder if they have enter-
tained a gorilla unawares. The Gerhog,
when he is back in the last ditch, will doubt-
less appeal to the recognised theories of
war, and the propositions of the Hague
Convention, and the Declaration of London,
and the ordinary doctrines and practices of
humanity, and demand to be treated accord-
ingly. The question is raised whether
ordinary laws and rules apply in his case.
Various writers suggest that he should be
served with what the law courts describe
as “short notice of injunction.” It is
proposed that he should receive intimation
that the damage he has already done in
contravention of the ordinary procedure of
civilised but hostile folks will have to be
naid for in cash, in addition to the usual
indemnity to cover all expenses. That for
future outrages the old Hebrew law of a
tooth for a tooth will be adopted—in other
words, that field will be burned for field,
and town for town, and that for every non-
combatant who is proved to have been killed
a Gerhog will be hanged. That the Kaiser
will be executed when captured, and his
family and his relations exiled, after
confiscation of their private property. Also
that trade with Germany will be prohibited ;
that no Gerhog shall be admitted into, any
foreign country, and that any foreigner
who is married to a Gerhog may dissolve
the marriage at will, on the ground that the
other partner to the bargain is suspected
of being one of the lower animals, who
stood upright with intent to deceive and
wore a mean disguise of clothes.
* *• * *
In brief, the Kaiser’s demented conviction
that he and his crowd may break all recog-
nised usages, but that his. opponents must
always obey them in their dealings with
him. threatens to make Europe tired. The
tiredness only shows itself as yet in casual
writings here and there, but it is liable to
extend. If civilisation is to burst up, a lot
of people say it may as well burst on both
sides, and thus abbreviate the worry. In the
last resort the Gerhog people are responsi-
ble for their Kaiser,. who only exists by
their permission. Being a cultured people
and a shining light, they are liable for
their soldiers, and their officers, and their
Government. No great nation can shelter
itself wholly and permanently behind the
orders of one lunatic or monstrosity. Every
civilised community makes, or maintains, its
own monstrosity. So a craving begins to
prevail in those sections of Europe which
have lost most heavily by Gerhog horrors,
that short notice of injunction shall be served.
In other words, that the soldier and officer-
even the field-marshal or prince or Kaiser —
who exceeds the speed limit in future shall
be treated as a common murderer, when cap-
tured and identified. In some more words,
that if the Gerhog nation takes the profit
of its atrocities it must pay not only m
money, but in flesh and blood and fire and
desolation and public contempt. If it puts
the blame on its Kaiser it must take on the
job of civilising its Kaiser, or getting rid of
him. If it can neither civilise its Kaiser
nor get rid of him it must admit itself a
failure among nations.
* * * *
The new literature which appears here and
there in Europe suggests that culture has
been set back many years. For that the
bumptious Prussian murderer carries the lia-
bility. In order to save time and money and
men the Allies, it is pleaded, mav be driven
to shed the garment of art and literature
and godliness as an encumbrance, and go
bald-headed for the Hoiienzotxern accord-
ing to his own methods —and for his people
if they continue to support him and his
methods. It is a lamentable business, but
too much Kaiser is demoralising to even the
best-regulated enemv.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Still Further Consideration.
It is a depressing circumstance that the
Administrator of the Northern Territory has
been around in Melbourne consulting with
the Minister who is responsible for the show
as to the best thing to be done. Too much
consultation has gone a long way towards
killing the Territory. It is always being
preached to death by wild curates, or talked
to death by tame philanthropists. There is
a weary farce of pretending that it. is . a
strange, lunatic place with straws in its
hair, and that none of the ordinary rules of
business or conduct apply to it. Hence all
these heaps of consultation. When it was
decided that something ought to be done for
Westralia the transcontinental railway was
started, along the shortest and cheapest
route that could be found. Nobody consulted
worth or even 2d. It was held that
the position was obvious. The Northern
Territory railway, to the construction of
which the Commonwealth is pledged, will be
a cheaper proposition than the Westralian
affair. It will run through better country.
Also it will develop the Commonwealth’s own
property —not a State property. But, un-
fortunately, owing to the shape. of Australia,
there are possibilities of diverting the north-
and-south railway, whereas the east-and-west
one had a single possible route ahead of it.
If the plain, simple agreement, made when
S. Australia handed over the Territory, for
the completion of the road from Port Aug-
usta to Port Darwin can be broken, a lot of
things may happen. The line may be
changed from a transcontinental to a coastal
affair. It may be brought to Townsville or
Brisbane or Sydney. Every member in the
three eastern States, save the representative
of One Horse Gulch, and possibly the mem-
ber for Big Tree in Gippsland, sees a vision
of the great undertaking coming his way, and
ending right at his ash-barrel. The result
is deadlock. While all the subterranean
negotiations are going on the situation is
disguised by the pretence that the Territory
is in some way different from any other bit of
land, and that before even a mile of line is
built two centuries of profound contempla-
tion are required. The wear and tear of
Gilkuth and the travelling expenses of
Gilruth are consequently tremendous ; and
if Gilruth was a drinking man—which,
thank Heaven, he isn’t —and his refreshments
on long trips were also debited to the Com-
monwealth, the result would be ruinous. All
this leads to nothing save that it postpones
the evil day when the route will have to be
decided, whereupon the Ministry will make
one or two ungrateful friends and a heap of
enemies.
A New Country and an Old Story.
Cockatoo Dock (Sydney) has had a feeling
even since Christmas that relations were
strained. There had been small, previous
troubles, but the big trouble arose when the
employees were offered double f>ay to work
during the Christmas holidays, because it
was a matter of urgency to push on the con-
struction of certain war vessels. They de-
manded treble pay, and as the Labor
Government of the Commonwealth has to
look hard at ways and means just now no
business was done. The dock closed up for
the holidays, and the urgent work was post-
poned. The employees can’t be blamed very
seriously over the matter, because, hard-
borrowing and hard-importing politicians
have so assiduously preached the idea that
because this is “a new country” there ought
to be 50s. in its f, that it is difficult to get
things into proper focus. The alleged fact
that we are so poor that we have to borrow
more per inhabitant in time of peace than
any other land on earth is set down to the
newness of the place. So is our alleged ina-
bility to manufacture our own goods. On
the other hand, the alleged fact that we are
so rich that we can pay higher wages for
shorter hours of labor than almost any other
community is charged up against the blessed
newness of Australia. In fact, the professed
freshness 'of the country accounts,. in the
abundant vocabulary of the politician, for
almost everything—good, bad and indifferent.
To return to the Cockatoo matter, the Dock
had a picnic on Anniversary Day, and there
was food, also oratory. This is an extract
from the latter :
Mr. R. Howe, M.H.R., said Ms idea of manage-
ment at the dock was not that of a general, to
dominate the men—a kind of militarism in industry
that he did not like —but of a manager, who would
consult the men, and from whom they could obtain
the redress of grievances. No doubt Mr. ,King-
Salter had come here with the idea of carrying out
Admiralty regulations as in the Old Country, but
such regulations had to be interpreted in the light
of the circumstances surrounding industrial life IN
A NEW COUNTRY.
The Bulletin has no desire to be dis-
agreeable, yet it proposes that any politician
or pressman who gets off the “new country”
gag after St. Valentine’s day of 1915 shall
be struck off the rolls and disqualified for
life. His job should be taken from him, and
his conversation for all the balance of his
days should be restricted to the weather.
Australia had three wonderful streaks of
good luck, inasmuch as it always escaped
war; it got the landed estate of a whole con-
tinent for nothing; and it discovered the
richest goldfields in all the world’s history.
It had two amazing streaks of ill-fortune,
inasmuch as it acquired a set of politicians
who said it was so young and rich that it
could only live by borrowing money from
poorer and older communities; and a set
which alleged that, because of its
young and splendid disadvantages, it
couldn’t do any skilled work for itself,
and must depend on imports. So it
borrows and imports because it is poor .and
crude; and it pays high wages because it is
rich and early. And it does both those
things because, according to the brilliant
peroration of R. H. Howe, M.H.R., and many
political time-servers of his kind, it is a
place that has just been invented. Some-
thing ought to be done to this amazing and
complicated complication.
Three Cheers for the Trust.
Dear Bulletin,- —It is a pity that so much
should be said about the foreign Trusts
which take goods out of Australia (the Meat
Trust, for instance), while so little is said
about the ones which bring goods into Aus-
tralia. The Meat Trust may aim at con-
trolling the Australian beef supply, and it
may, when it gets its hooks right into the
business, pay less for the flesh victual than
it should do. Still it promotes local
industry, for it urges the community to
grow animals; and it brings United States
money into the country (not so much as 1
should do, perhaps) to pay wages and to pay
for bullocks. On the other hand the UU
Trust, and the Harvester Trust, and the
Picture Theatre Film concern, and the sho
which supplies boot-making machinery, an
all the rest of the importing concerns so
beloved of Fisher and Co. take money out
of the country and repress local
The meat-exporting monopolists who ha
settled in Australia help this country to keep
solvent, and the worst that can be said ot
them is that they do it through purely selfish
motives. They at least make us lessi de-
pendent on foreign loans and foreigi P
talists. The machinery-importing and on-
importing and clothes-importing and jo&-
lots-importing monopolists are QUi

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Turkey seems to have gone quite mad with muddle
and poverty and defeat.—The Bulletin.
Out of the murk he came
Slipshod and suddenly;
Into the dust he goes
Swiftly and finally.
Thrown where the garbage of nations is
flung.
For the time of the great cleaning-up has
arrived, and neither Islam nor Europe
has any further use for the Ottoman.
Out of the murk he came,
Waving a meat-chopper,
Smiting the world with the
Whiskers of faith.
Islam amazed at him,
Honored him, boosted him,
Made him Chief Plunderer,
Gave him first call on her
Knife and her prayers.
Then he went like the wind of the desert,
blowing a tornado of snakes, and burst
in the door of Constantinople.
Sharp was the knife of him,
Bitter the boots of him,
Idly he chortled
The name of the Prophet,
Mopped up Belgrade with a
Whoop of his pants.
Startled Vienna beheld the long spears of
him,
Leaped at the danger
And kicked like an emu,
Taught the proud vanguard
Of Turkey to trot.
Then he went with great rapidity across the
Danube, carrying his wounds and scars
of battle mostly in his spine and the
soles of his feet-
Slipshod and suddenly
Through the long centuries,
Bumped with some violence
Out of his plunder grounds,
Slowly his threadbare
Whiskers retired.
Calm as an over-ripe
Case of tomatoes
The bag of his pants _
Grew accustomed to kicks.
Once in a while with a start he awakened,
Felt the old madness rush hot in his blood.
Then, in spite of the fact that Greece,
Bessarabia, Moldavia, Wallachia, Ser-
via, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Bulgaria,
Roumelia, the Crimea,, and large tracts
of his dominions in Asia and Africa had
been torn from his futile grasp, he
began killing on general principles and
causing suffering in a large, almost-
German way.
Fierce as a shark among
Surf-bathing nursemaids,
Flabby as whale blubber,
Solemn as ink,
Europe observed him,
Examined him carefully,
Prayerfully, wonderingly, uncomprehendingly,
Praised him —or told him
To go and get work.
Then a tradition arose and was fostered,
Vaunting his valor in spite of ill-fortune,
Called him the best fighting man on the
continent,
Though in such evident neeed of insecticide,
Also of reading and writing and soap.
But he wasn’t the best fighting man by
several streets. He had been, but he
had degenerated into a lamentable slack-
trousered shirk who only shone by con-
trast with other shirks even more
lamentable. And so Macedonia, Crete,
Albania and part of Thrace were taken
away from him, and he sat foaming at
the mouth by the Bosphorus.
Slipshod and indolent,
Blind but still truculent,
Waiting for fate in the shape of a boot,
Far to the north he observed a bold gentle-
man
Playing a game that had points ot resem-
blance
To pastimes the world recognised as his own.
“Truly,” he said, “if my friend be an infidel,
Actions like his show a glimmer of faith.
His is the sport that I learned in my
infancy—
By the prophet’s true beard he is brother
of mine!”
So with perfect willingness, but a general
absence of bootlaces, the Turk joined
brother William in his attempt to beat
civilisation on a knock-out.
Frightful the pants of him
nagged to nakedness.
Slouching to battle
Unkempt and unfed,
He who had been, ;
But decidedly wasn’t ,
An object of terror
Woke laughter and scorn.
“Look at Bill’s mate,” cried the
World in astonishment,
“Turning his hind rags
For Europe to kick !”
So the Russians kicked, and the British
kicked, and the French kicked, and the
Servians kicked. At first they'okicked
singly, and then they kicked altogether,
and the Turk went out on his purple
ear, and even Islam joined in the
laughter.
Out of the murk he came,
Slipshod and suddenly,
Into the dark he goes
Swiftly and finally, . .
Flung where the garbage of nations is Hung.
N.S.W.
CURSE O' MOSES.


rampant in their greed, but as they
are purely receivers of cash, instead
of payers of cash, they help to make the
country insolvent. Australia, by some won-
derful kink, regards it as a virtue to make
war on the Trust which pays us money and
urges us to rear bullocks ; while, as a chronic
sinker of the fiscal issue, this country con-
siders it another virtue to speak kindly to
the Trust which takes our money and shuts
up our local factories. I conclude, respect-
fully, with three cheers for the Meat Trust
and the Wheat Trust (if there is one), not
because they are in any way desirable, but
because they are not one-tenth so disastrous
as the foreign manufacturing Trusts, for
which Holman seems to be fugleman, and
Hughes chief bugle-blower, and Andrew
Fisher advance agent.—Yours abundantly,
Henry Horsecollar.
♦
Let Us Contend.
If there is any merit at all about the old
Party Government System it is in the fact
that it makes for the persistent criticism of
Ministers. As an outcome of the war its
last justification vanishes. No one seri-
ously criticises anybody in high authority,
under penalty of being accused of pro-Ger-
manism. In the Australian Parliament,
where Defence matters are concerned, there
is a certain amount of reason in this —and it
is in accordance with the eternal cussedness
of things that what criticism has come of
late from the Opposition has been aimed
almost wholly at the Defence Department.
But there is no reason why there should be
a truce to comment in regard to the acts
of Ministers who have nothing to do with
Defence matters, and there is no shadow of
excuse for silence on the question of State
Ministers and their doings. The effect is to
turn the Ministries of the day into so many
autocracies; and an autocracy is an unpleas-
ant thing to have about the premises for
however brief a period. The present war
has evidently come to stay for a considerable
time—possibly for years. If Parliamentary
criticism of Ministers is going to be
accepted during all that time as an indication
of disloyalty to. the Empire, old wrongs are
going to flourish tremendously and new
wrongs are going to be born. The perils of
the situation have already been shown in
connection with the Censorship. The cen-
sors, all over Australia, have, to put it
mildly, shown great incompetence. With
doubtless the best of intentions they have
done the worst service to the cause which
they presumably have at heart. At a time
when the Germans were surging over all
opposition, the press was allowed to speak
only of victory. No one who had access to
an atlas was deceived; it made a laughing-
stock of us abroad; and it gave the citizen
of fighting age an excuse to hang back at a
time when he was most needed. The censor
has been the first real despot in our brief
island story, and the verdict on him is that
he is a failure. Last week C. G. Wade, of
N. S. Wales, announced that “peace inside
and outside Parliament was of more import-
ance than anything,” and the local papers
gave, him three cheers for his clear-sighted
patriotism. Politician and press were
alike wrong. If criticism is useful at normal
times, it. is equally useful in a crisis, pro-
vided it is administered in the sort of spirit
which the public insists on just now. There
is nothing that is worse for a Ministry,
nothing that puts it out of touch with the
general feeling sooner, than the knowledge
that, whatever hapoens, its members are
immune from assault. What the country
needs to recognise as soon as possible is the
circumstance that the war has become a sort
of institution. The Government of the
Commonwealth and of the States must pro-
ceed, in normal fashion, side by side with
it. Where a Federal or State Minister errs
on a financial or tariff or other issue he
should be. told about it in the House in the
old forthright fashion. In fact, he should be
spoken to, if anything, in more forthright
terms than ever. The fact that the country
is in danger is the noorest of reasons why its
Governments should be given a blank cheque
and told to go and do its worst.
The Victorian Irrigation Fraud.
Unless Victoria produces an axe and a
leader with the will and energy to use it,
another of that State’s great undertakings
will. go to more or less permanent smash,
leaving another load of debt for posterity to
liquidate. The matter was lately set forth
by irrigation-expert Elwood Mead, at
Shepparton, to the public in general and
Premier Peacock and three of his Ministers
in particular. In effect, if the present Min-
isterial intentions with regard to irrigation
are. carried out, Mead says the whole State
policy will result in a fiasco. Eastward
from the Goulburn head-works runs a
channel capable of irrigating 40,000 acres,
and “if the whole of those 40,000 acres are
not being irrigated the channel and the
water are wasted.” The same Goulburn
scheme provides for the .adequate watering
of 200,000 acres in the Rodney district.
“Here are small tracts producing up to their
limit, but alongside them are large tracts
producing nothing.” Money is thus thrown
away and water wasted. The present policy
is to run channels wherever anyone may
want water. These channels supply intense
culturists here and there along the route,
but pass acres on acres of irrigable lands.
In a dry season the negligent persons grab
as much water as they want, leaving the
regular and persistent irrigationist at the
end of the channel to go without. The lat-
ter’s so-called water right is accord-
ingly a fraud and a sham. Not only is this
policy shiftless and extravagant, but it is
wasteful in another and direct way, because,
though in running (say) three acre-feet of
water along a channel you may lose one
acre-foot by soakage and evaporation, you
can run six acre-feet along the same channel
without losing more than 1| feet. Mead’s
remedy is the one advocated long ago—levy
an irrigation rate on lands supplied with
water, so as to compel the owners to use
the fluid to the land’s full capacity or sell
out to those who will. Then Mead would
reduce all irrigation schemes to the spider’s
web plan—the head works in the centre, with
radiating channels wherever needed, and
extended only as the lands already served
are taken up and utilised. The present plan,
which works out much like the track of a
fly on a wall, is utterly wasteful. More-
over, it is financially immoral, inasmuch as
at public cost it enhances the value of locked-
up territory, and thus plays into the hands
of that curse of the country, the loafing land
monopolist.
The Silver Bullet.
The daily press is still full of complaints
by elderly people on the subject of the young
Australians’ alleged unwillingness to volun-
teer. There is a type whose blood boils with
rage every time he sees a civilian male under
30. Judging by the way he writes, nothing
would please him more than to see the youth
of the Commonwealth blown to pieces en
masse, just to teach it a lesson. The theatres
feature songs which urge the young men to
get off to the front, and pour scorn on those
who stay. behind. The old men applaud
these ditties madly. A great deal of this
agitation begins to look like an impudent
attempt on the part of the elderly to obscure
the particular war-issue which affects them-
selves. The British Chancellor of the
Exchequer has said that “money and
material will be greater factors in this war
than men,” and that “victory will probably
go to the owner of the last 100 millions.”
For months the efficacy of “the silver bullet”
has been on every pavement strategist’s
tongue. Now, the silver bullet is chiefly for
the old and middle-aged to mould. Well-to-
do old men can’t go to the front. But they
can subscribe money freely. Regardless of
the effect on the import trade, they can
support a fiscal policy which will enable
this country to start making war materials
without delay. And they can advocate com-
pulsory service for adult males, and accept
the resulting disorganisation of their staffs
as one of the sacrifices demanded of them
by the Empire. Are they acting in that
way? Everyone knows they are not. The
importers are as anti-Protectionist as ever.
Many large employers of labor grow cold
at the mere thought of “conscription.” And
as regards what may be called spot-cash
patriotism—well, any issue of any paper
will supply a means of judging. For in-
stance :—•
The authorities are apparently to appeal in vain
for motor ambulances. So far, none have been
received at district headquarters. One Field Ambu-
lance Company was despatched with the First Con-
tingent, but it was only equipped with TO horse-
drawn vehicles. The latest advices from the British
War Office state that each ambulance section must
be provided with seven motor and three horsfe ambu-
lances. These vehicles cost approximately £550
each.
No State’s war fund reaches a quarter of a
million. Four citizens who met casually in
a Sydney club six years ago gave £40,000
among them to the foolish old Dread-
nought fund in the same casual fashion as
a tram-guard might have given 2d. No one
has given £lO,OOO to the War fund, though,
in the present crisis, the Empire is not
merely threatened with attack by Germany,
but is battling for its life with that nation.
In fact, a study of the lists goes to show
that the rich man who has weighed in with
as much as £2OO is a rarity. The military
authorities state that recruits have been
offering freely since the beginning of the
war, and that more can be got when they
are wanted. That is to say, the young men
of Australia are freely offering their lives,
which is all most of them have to offer. How
many of the men and women whose incomes
range from £2OOO to £40,000 per annum
have offered anything like the sum in cash
at which they value life and health? How
many would risk death or mutilation or an
attack of cholera for £20,000? And how
many have given a quarter of that, to them,
paltry sum? If any one class is failing in
its duty over this war it is not the young
who are poor, but the old who are rich.
Even if our capitalists can’t draw the sword
for the Empire they can at least draw the
cheque, and the unanimity with which they
are not doing it is disgraceful. \

The Sevenpenny Drink.
The protest of “Steady Drinker” :
The publican is one of the few who earns big
money easily. The community has grown to associ-
ate him with diamonds, a behemoth appearance, and
cigars. So long as he behaved at all decently a big
section of the public has, nevertheless, been willing
that he should be guaranteed the security of his
license. • In this spirit his patrons have for years
allowed themselves to be robbed, and never seri-
ously kicked. But the trade may presume on that
too much.
The other day the Australian Government was
forced into levying some mild war taxes on the
nation. The publicans—l write in N. S. Wales —■
decided immediately that the new imposts necessi-
tated a rise in prices. Let us see what that means
by considering the position of the sixpenny bar.
The trade has carried a resolution to put up prices
there to sevenpence. The whisky with the largest
sale costs to the trade 545. 6d. the dozen, or 4s. 6£d.
a bottle. The publican figures that 16 drinks run
to the bottle, so that the return is Bs. per bottle at
sixpence and 9s. 4d. at sevenpence. But measured
by the quartern, which is more than the average
drinker takes each time, the bottle runs to 20 drinks,
and so returns 10s. at sixpence and 11s. Bd. at
sevenpence. Still, taking the publican’s own estimate
of 16 drinks, by raising this price to sevenpence he
makes an extra 16s. a dozen. He does this to meet
the Government war excise, which is 6s. the dozen!
Of course, he gives in soda —at Is. a dozen. As
against the soda he sells soft stuff. A typical line
costs him Id. a bottle, and he sells it at 6d. Also,
he gets 24 per cent, discount on his whisky and
sells the empty bottles for Is. a dozen.
For bottled lagers he pays from 6s. 9d. to Bs. a
dozen. Say, 74d. the bottle “in and out.” Each
bottle holds five drinks. The return at sixpence a
glass is half a crown a bottle, and now it is one
penny short of 3s. English stout costs him 12s. 3d.
the dozen, and the return is the same.
But his star robbery is with draught lager. This
costs him Is. 9d. the gallon, so if sold at sixpence a
pint it returns 4s. a gallon. If sold at sixpence the
half-pint it: retur.ng Bs. the gallon. But what it
really is sold by is the glass—not the long-sleever,
but the saloon-bar glass—and then it goes 20 drinks,
or 10s. to the gallon at sixpence a drink, and 11s. Bd.
to the gallon at sevenpence a drink.
There are a few hotels which, defiant of the Trade,
have refused to ask the sevenpenny rate. As a
means of bringing these recalcitrants to heel, the
Trade has approached the wholesalers, and attempted
to get the supplies of the rebels stopped. This action
amounts at Common Law to a criminal offence. But
that is a side-issue. The features that chiefly con-
cern beer and spirit drinkers are that the pub busi-
ness was capable of being run at a colossal profit
under the old system, and that the pub-keepers have
seized on the war to turn their concerns from stead-
ily-paying gold mines into Goltondas. The new
move plays suicidally into the hands of • the Aboli-
tionists, and it provides another argument • in support
of the nationalisation of drink.
The Bad Man at the Front.
Something is said about the weeding-out of
“undesirables” —drunks and gamblers, and
soldiers who howl at night, and fellows who
haunt the back streets of Cairo during the
dark hours and wink at Egyptian girls—
from the Australian forces in Egypt. These
dubious characters, it is alleged, are to be
sent back to Australia in disgrace, so that
they may marry undesirably, and rear un-
desirable families, while the good men go
to the fi’ont, and do battle with the Turk,
and are shot by Abdul Fez. This idea that
the worst citizen should be carefully pre-
served from destruction, and get a free
passage home to the place where he used
to be a nuisance, and become one of the
fathers of the community, and help to make
our laws, and even go into Parliament, while
the best citizen is killed, looks like an
absurdity. Every undesirable who is already
in the foi’ce should be carefully preserved.
Every criminal, hunchback, forger or
other bad character who seeks to enlist
should be enlisted with enthusiasm. The
drunkard should be taken on the evidence of
his breath and his nose. The worst scoundi’els
should have extra pay, if necessary; and
extra special uniforms, and on the day of
battle they should go first, being the folk who
can best be spared. They would certainly
kill somebody before they died. The front
ranks should include the most quarrelsome
drunk, the most chronic beer-chewer, the
worst poet, the hardened loafer, the publican
who adulterates his liquor, the counter-
luncher, the inveterate assault-and-battery
person, Bill Sikes, Butler, Deeming, all
the discoverable bushrangers, all the avail-
able pirates, the man with the largest
number of convictions, the constant mur-
derer, the religious maniac, the sexual per-
vert, Oscar Wilde, the deviser of indecent
postcards, the Plunchback of Notre Dame,
the Outlaw of Iceland and Jack the Kipper.
And when they had done their bit of trouble
with the enpmy the reputable citizens who
came behind would have an easier row to hoe.
“Happy Jack’s” Fish.
Having accumulated a deficit of close on
£900,000 in little more than three years, and
lifted Westralia’s debt well up to £lOO per
head, “Happy Jack”- Scaddan is dazzled
with the magnificence of his achievements,
and casts round for fresh worlds to conquer.
His brickyards haven’t cheapened bricks, his
State sawmills haven’t reduced the price of
timber, his steamers and meat shops have
not caused the price of the grill and the roast
to pine away. Nevertheless, when lately
there was a howl for cheaper fish he was
inspired to buy a trawler, which, he assured
the populace, would knock the bottom out of
the Dago “ring,” and enable the community
t.o revel in sea produce for next to nothing.
Of course, the usual thing happened. After
an absence of a fortnight the trawler turned
up with eight tons of fish, which meant about
30dwt. to each Perth inhabitant. To keep
faith with the public and his fish stall occu-
pied, Scaddan is therefore now buying sup-
plies from the Dagoes at sixpence and seven-
pence per lb., and, consequently, either has
to sell at a higher price than fish ever
fetched before or show another big loss. But
that doesn’t trouble “Happy Jack.” Like
the Kaiser he is a universal genius—ship-
owner, fisherman. fishmonger, publican,
brickmaker, financier, general statesman —
in fact, he has done everything save keep the
Treasury solvent and write an opera. He
rushes about assuring the State that, though
the future looks a trifle blue, rain and peace
will make everything in the garden bloom
again. The original Micawber never had
the luck of the Micawber at the Westralian
Treasury. Wilkins was sure something
would turn up, though he had no idea what
it might be. Jack has a blessed and definite
war to comfort him, and a still more blessed
though not quite so definite peace to look
forward to for putting all things right.

Many Bankrupt Counties of N.S.W.
The protest against the wholesale reduction
of the country railway services in N.S.W.
is loud, but unhappily there aren’t sufficient
people in the reduced areas to. protest
in a convincing fashion. Still the
facts remain that the railways repre-
sent the bulk of the “permanent and
reproductive” loan works of the State, and
more than half of them were run at a dead
loss long before the war started or the recent
little drought was heard of. The loss of
more than half the N.S.W. railways was
bad in the rich, prosperous year of 1912, and
it was worse in the rich, prosperous
year of 1913. Also it had been bad
for 20 or more years previous to that. Some
people propound a theory that the reason
why many remote country railways don’t
pay is that the craze for shutting up every
deep-water port except Sydney makes the
country bare and bald and scant of popula-
tion. They hint that the outlying lines don’t
pay for want of people to use them. In
other words, that their districts suffer from
premeditated emptiness and a conspiracy to
prevent inhabitants —all this being done with
the misguided idea that the one reliable way
to boom Sydney and the bloated landlords
thereof is to kill every other place. Cer-
tainly the policy of killing the country has
been pursued strenuously. At the date of
the census of 1891 the population of N.S.W.
—apart from the people of Norfolk Island
and the handful of sailors op board ships in
various harbors —>was 1,118.250. and the"
three counties of Cumberland. Northumbei’-
land and Camden contained 574,950 people,
or 15,825 more than one-half. In 1901 the
population was 1,346,720, and the; three
counties of Cumberland. Northumberland
and Camden held 702.937 inhabitants, or
29,577 moi’e than one-half. In 1911 the
population was 1.638.578, and two counties
—Cumberland and Northumberland : in other
words, Sydney and Newcastle —showed a
total of 843,099, which was 23,810 in excess
of half the population. By 1921, if the
One-Big-City policy has any luck, one county
—Cumberland —out of all the 144 counties
of N.S.W., will hold more than half the
population. Meanwhile the railways in the
other 143 counties are naturally worked at
a loss. How can it be otherwise?
The Penny Crocodile.
Last Thursday that incurable advocate of
cheap imports, the Sydney Telegraph,
broke into a weep about the sufferings of
the women toilers of Australia. A sample
of the lamentation ensues:—
In some classes of factories where the wages are
fixed at from 235. to 255., a big percentage of the
girls are going through a particularly bad time. In
the panic following immediately upon the war declar-
ations numbers of hands were dispensed with ; but
the pendulum having quickly swung back to normal,
most of the girls were reinstated. The few weeks
away from employment, however, threw them so far
back, from a monetary point of view, that they have
had no opportunity of regaining lost ground, especi-
ally as, since the subsidence of the Christmas rush,
the greater number of them have been on “half-time.”
This means that instead of the weekly 235. or 255.
they are forced to exist upon 11s. 6d. or 12s. fid.
It is impossible to imagine how so small a sum can
be spread over the needs of seven long days, or how
these girls, who. taking them collectively, are a
bright and intelligent body, anxious to maintain
their respectability, and with a feminine regard for
appearances, can manage to keep on the narrow path,
with their bodies half-starved and their souls crying
out for only the things that would make life toler-
ably easy.
But, after all, why should the Freetrade
paper repine? Australia, by reason of its
low tariff, imports annually millions of
pounds worth of the goods which these girls
might otherwise be making, and taxes them
to pay interest on the loans which help to
pay for the goods which they aren’t allowed
to make. And if anyone suggests that the
girls should have more work the Telegraph
accuses him of trying to put up prices, to
obstruct commerce, and to knock a hole in
the immortal doctrines of Cobden. In fact,
the old King-street publication wants to have
the tariff reduced, so that there may be more
imports and less work. Someone ought to
buy a handkerchief for this weeping penny
crocodile.

The mid-ocean “removal” of Count von
Keller from a liner which was taking him
back from a “secret mission to the United
States.” and his subsequent trip to Gibraltar
in a British cruiser, is about the last pos-
sible proof that Britain really does rule the
waves. The dreadful humiliation of Ger-
many may be measured by applying the same
set of circumstances to Britain. Sup-
pose the British fleets had been chased
into port and that somebody of the
calibre of Curzon or Cromer tried
to sneak out to Japan by crossing secretly
to Marseilles and there embarking on a
French ship. Imagine the French ship
stopped by a German cruiser, the distin-
guished Englishman taken off and forcibly
transferred to the nearest stronghold
of the enemy. What an agony of shame
would rack England! Proud Germany,
which has just suffered the unimaginable
humiliation, will probably retaliate by blow-
ing up some Norfolk farmer’s hen-house
with a Zeppelin bomb.
It seems as though the Gerhogs have
exhausted one of the great advantages with
which they began the war. At the outset
they had a whole bagful of carefully-pre-
pared tricks, and they worked them with
good results. But a trick is no good after
it has been found out. For instance, the
German submarines operated for a while
under cover of trawlers carrying a neutral
flag; but now an honest-looking trawler
merely invites suspicion where formerly it
served to deceive. So, also, it is now prac-
tically certain that naturalised Gerhogs in
motor-cars directed the course of the air-
ships which recently bombed a bit of Britain’s
border; and that sort of trick is not good
for oftener than once. In desperation the
creature has now either to hide or fight more
or less in the open ; and then things happen
like the very distressing accident to the
Blucher.
In the N.S.W. Legislative Council last week
Dr. Doyle directed the Health Minister’s
attention to the possibility of contagious
disease being spread throughout Australia by
retux-ning soldiers. Flowers replied that
he would “consult the Federal authorities in
the matter.” That many soldiers are suffer-
ing from disease, acquired either in Egypt
or on the way there, has been stated by the
official journalistic representative of the Com-
monwealth Government, Captain C. W.
Bean ; and such a report ought to be fol-
lowed by the authorities taking the most
stringent precautions against the spread of
the trouble upon the return of the troops.
It would be in the interests of Australia if
the Defence Department utilised this oppor-
tunity to confer with the Special Committee
appointed by the last Australasian Medical
Congress.

Now that the N. S. Wales liquor retailer
has, by the grace of the Government, been
enabled to wring additional profit out of
consumers, The Bulletin asks once more
when the Board of Health proposes to com-
pel the publican to remove the danger of
the filthy drinking utensil. Tubs of standing
water remain unchanged until they are
nauseating. Into this stew glasses are
dipped, half dried or dirtied by towels that
would be unclean in a lavatory, and passed
over the counter again for fresh (or not so
fresh) customers. Amongst the drinkers in
the bars are sufferers from every imaginable
disease, from influenza to syphilis; yet,
without the least remonstrance from the
Department, established to preserve the
.public’s health, the bar-keeper is permitted
to spread any and all germs broadcast. In
Victoria every person who serves food,
liquors, etc., in any licensed premises is
bound under penalty to thoroughly clean,
in clear running water, all eating or drink-
ing utensils immediately they ar.e done with,
and occasionally an offender against the
regulation is discovered and fined. In N. S.
Wales, while there are some publicans who
follow a similar rule, there are so many who
don’t that they are a menace to the com-
munity and a reproach to the Government

Our Old Friend, the War.
During last week the torpid troops —a good
many millions of them —have been getting out
of their trenches as the days grew a trifle
longer, and shooting with renewed energy.
The war bill is now alleged to be £10,000,000
per day, which is possibly an exaggeration.
The German has been making another effort
to break through the French lines and reach
Calais, though nobody has yet decided what
good that shallow port and picturesque old
town would be to him. It is the nearest
place to England, and the handiest place
from which to make grimaces at England,
but owing to the increased dimensions of
warships it lost all value as a naval port
200 or 300 years ago. Anyhow, the attempt
to break through has so far failed. All the
parties concerned are bringing up gigantic
reinforcements, and Kitchener’s alleged
statement that the war will really begin in
May appears to have evidence behind it.
The boys who have just come of age for
service are being gathered in by hundreds
of thousands, and put through their drill,
and presently there will be a fresh war on
top of the old one, though the old one was
certainly big enough. A few unarmed mer-
chant ships belonging to the Allies have
been sunk by German submarines. One of
them was the property of the Shaw, Savill
Shipping Co., which makes the second
Britain-Maoriland trader to be sacrificed
in the great scrap. The boats were
insured, and Maoriland didn’t lose much, but
the anger of Auckland and the rage of Wanga-
nui will probably help on the business of
enlistment. The main German fleet still
keeps out of sight, and accumulates barna-
cles in harbor. Whether it has_ got cold feet,
or whether it lias a card up its sleeve and
four aces hidden in its boots is uncertain.
The Grand Duke Nicholas has lived up to
his reputation as a plausible peer as
well as a great general. By a persistent
process of hovering he created the impres-
sion that his next big effort would be made
in Hungary. It was characteristic of the
silent man that he is now harrying the
north-east of Prussia, where he was hardly
expected at this cold season. Italy and
Roumania still dream of joining the Allies.
The Turkish army which tried to invade
Russia by way of the Caucasus and Ararat
and the debris of Noah’s Ark is scarcely
heard of these days, so badly has it been
wrecked among the snows; but the Un-
speakable is making a genuine effort to in-
vade Egypt, and the Anglo-Austral-Egyptian
army, which is tired of looking at the Pyra-
mids and the old Sphinx, hopes to see his
topknot on the horizon at any moment.
Persia, which is a hopeless, shambling
country, first demonstrated on the side of
the Allies and then drifted into the camp of
the enemy. So Russia has taken it on.
along with Turkey and Austria and
a share of Germany. Persistent rumors
drift around that Hungary will try
to break away from Austria and make
peace by itself. The Hungarian com-
plains that the Austrian persistently_ shoves
him into the post of danger, while the
Austrian complains that the German shoves
him into the post of danger. Also, the Turk
says the same thing about the German,
whose unpopularity appears to be almost un-
limited. There are still immense fighting
possibilities about the German-Austrian-
Turkish league, but it becomes more and
more evident that the Kaiser at Berlin —
however sick and sorry he may be —is the
driving force. President Wilson, of the
United States, has sent his best wishes to
the Kaiser on his birthday. The neces-
sity to pass the hat round for Servia
becomes apparent once more. Even Bel-
gium hasn’t been reduced so completely
to hunger and ashes and desolation
as the little isolated kingdom which
stood the first shock of the war. According
to a descriptive writer who lately wandered
that way : “It is three months since a Ser-
vian baby has been known to smile.” The
statement isn’t original, but it is probably
true.
“The Dazed Australian”: I couldn’t tell
the exact manner in which _ the German
cruiser Blucher came to her timely end the
other day in the North Sea. It had been
cabled that she had been sunk by—
(X) The Lion’s gunfire.
(2) A broadside from the Tiger.
(3) A shell from the Princess Royal.
(41 A torpedo from the Arethusa.
(5) Pot shots from the British ships as they tore
past after the fleeing Hogman battleships.
I was certain there was a mistake some-
where, and the latest message bears me out.
It explains:—
The battlecruiser New Zealand rammed the
Blucher. crushed her decks, and demolished her
guns, while the Tiger’s 13$in. guns swept the fore-
turret, with its gun crews, over the side.
That, in addition to making the action clear,
shows the precision of the British gunlayer.
Here we have one battleship ramming the
enemy on (say) the port side while another
sweeps the alien decks without damaging her
consort. Nothing could be more inspiring to
us Australians who are just beginning to
understand the ABC of seamanship.

“At Cripple Creek” is suffering a second
or third revival at Melbourne Princess’s,
and there is life in the old joke yet.
It is not a self-confessed joke, of course.
Officially speaking, it is a drama which
fascinates and thrills you. All the same, it
is funny. The two villains who supply
the plot never get near to the consummation
of their evil purposes. They swagger around
a wild and lawless pub in the Rocky Moun-
tains, offering girls for sale by auction and
putting poison in the glass of Thirsty Ann,
the Female Firebrand, and saying “Curse-
you-I'll-be-even-with-you-yet” to the johnme
who defies them. But they never score a
point. A young wowser miner, aided by an
Injun in a crown of many feathers, and
abetted by a polite stranger from Ifoo Yark,
defeats the two villains all along. The
girls, without exception, are on the wowser’s
side. Even Thirsty Ann gets converted and
joins Joe’s morality class. Finally Joe’s
gold mine—a fine, spacious property, which
Seems eminently adapted for a beer store —
breaks out into a rash of nuggets, and the
two bad men are wiped out by Speckled
Rooster, the faithful Injun.
* * * *
A strain of gentle sadness runs through
the elocution of Conway, Beckett, Stanford
and some of the ladies engaged in this drama
of unbridled passions. One feels that they
would be better able to give a powerful per-
formance of a Sunday-school picnic. They
set you thinking of buns and milk rather
than of blood and thunder. But perhaps
they were tired on Saturday, after changing
the bill every seventh night for many weeks.
Besides, they are all about to leave the dear
old Princess’s stage, where they have so
long shrieked together. On Saturday another
co. comes to present “The Beggar Girl’s
Wedding” at the same popular prices.
** * *
At Her Majesty’s, Melbourne, the grand
annual frivolity continues as before. The
first matter for merriment is a miraculous
extraction of fishes from the Baron’s pond,
and the last scene of all is the
Gorgeous Wedding of Cinderella —at the
Prince’s Palace, or it may be the Fairy
Queen’s flat. “Cinderella” is a high-toned
story wherein all the characters are con-
nected with the aristocracy by birth,
marriage or estate. Even the he-dame, who
wears a fraudulent top to her head, and
patters about her first husband after the
manner of her kind, all he-dames being
widows haunted by recollections of their
dead victim and the things he used to say
in his courting days—even the he-dame with
the blushing nose becomes a Bar-o-ness in
the course of this harmless entertainment.
** * *
At Melb. Royal each week of “Bought
and Paid For” continues to add six
nights and a matinee to the score. Next
week the mat. will be laid on Thursday, in
order that all the mummers in Melbourne
may be present, whilst the spare seats are
filled by ordinary public “at the ordinary
prices.”
** * *
The panto, at Melbourne King’s will
declare tits innings closed on Friday this
week, affer which “Sinbad” is to go touring
for an indefinite period. On Saturday the
King’s reverts to melodrama and a “quick-
change” policy, beginning with a soulful
revival of “The Confession.”

Ywoxy, another of the tribe of tramp vio-
linists, is the celebrity of the week at
Melbourne Bijou. Ywoxy is a musician;
even his annoying weakness for ragtime
fails to convince you otherwise. One
Doblodo reappears with a party of trained
sheep; and a charmer named De Yere in-
dulges in dashing eyeplay in one or two
ditties of endearing character. Finally,
“Hullo, St. Kilda” continues to give a dis-
tant Amurkan greeting to the seaside suburb
without mentioning it, and in general it is
no brighter than it used to be.
All Geebung Jim remembers of the Follies
and the panto.
No novelties have come to pass at the
Tivoli (Melb.) or late, but recent reappear-
ances are numerous. The aerial Lesters,
who perform mostly with their feet upper-
most, are back for a term. Likewise Helen,
Leach and Wallin, two of whom are iron-
jawed ladies, the third being a wire-walking
youth of equally ornate appearance. Also
George Hall, the genial and elderly story-
teller from America. Odiva and Laura
Guerite are in the last-nights’ stage, and
the Follies’ revue is promised for the 13th.
* * * *
With Itoyal and Tivoli and King’s all
closed for the moment —the last-named is
just reopening with the ape and elephant
which have been showing in Melbourne—
other Adelaide shows have, had a special
chance. Waller’s “Strollers” have a big
public demand, and are beginning to book
dates in other capitals. The show centres
round Sydney James, ventriloquist and all-
round actor, but the orchestra, with Ivanoff,
its Russian fiddling conductor, is a strong
item. Branscombe’s “Dandies” make a fea-
ture of dancing, with Collins and Browne,
and Marguerite Leroy; and of concerted
scenes, with the clever Dorothy Gardner and
Cuthbert Rose. In pictures, the little Star
is putting up a film locally produced, show-
ing (more or lessl the escapades of Lindsay
Kemble when he lately pervaded Adelaide
streets in feminine attire for several weeks.
The suddenly-famous youth himself is now
doing a stage tour of the country towns.
“Bildad”: Some people in N.S.W. com-
plain that Private Enterprise is being over-
done by the present Government. It is
hardly possible for Selector Smith to sell a
bag of seed wheat to Selector Jones on the
other side of the three-rail fence without
having a lengthy interview with a Board, or
seeing one of the three enormously wealthy
firms to whom the whole wheat-buying busi-
ness of the State has been entrusted at a big
commission. This makes Smith angry, and
it also makes Jones infuriated. Smith says
it is useless, and Jones concurs.
They are making a small fuss in Mel-
bourne over the number of motor fatalities
in 1914. For the metropolitan area they
totalled 22, as against 17 in 1913 and 12 in
1912. Nobody is making any fuss at all
over the number of unknown dead babies
discovered. They totalled 18 last year, and
the number for many years has been a trifle
higher, and never less. These babies don’t
die by accident, nor do they commit suicide.
They die because their mothers don’t know
what else to do with them, and because a
community of Stigginses or Pecksniffs or
Heeps will not provide a State refuge for
them.
The painful history of Henry IX. —
The other day, at Ballarat, Henry Webb was invited
to be frank and explain why he continued to owe
Victoria a large sum of money for the maintenance
of his six “illegitimate” children. He didn’t
appear. It was, however, explained for him that
after Henry had been guilty of the sixth infant, he
had left the mother of the brood and had married
another woman, by whom he had two children.
Further, it was mentioned that, being consumptive,
he was now unable to work, and his regular wife
and the two authenticated children were on the verge
of starvation. The P.M. —well, what could the P.M. do?
He said, of course, that it was all very unsatisfac-
tory, but what was the use of sending the man to
gaol and thus merely adding to the burdens of the
State? That prize-fool institution had, as usual,
come in when the damage was done, instead of calling
Henry aside before he married the lady and asking
him to produce his bill of health. Certainly, if he
hadn’t married the lady he would probably have gone
ahead all the same, and a consumptive wreck can’t
earn tucker for an unmarried wife any better than
he can for a married missus. That being so, segrega-
tion seems the only remedy that the community is
likely to stand. f There is another, but its time hasn’t
come yet.
Tremendous is the dignity of the Court of
Law. A peanut vendor who dresses eccen-
trically was before the Manly (N.S.W.)
Court last week for some piffling offence,
and even before the wheels of Justice had
begun to revolve, “was admonished by the
Police Magistrate for his disrespect to the
Court in appearing in such clothes.” The
notion that Courts have to be deferred to by
the wearing of special garments comes from
England. A London King’s Bench Judge
has, in quite recent times, refused to hear
counsel because he whs' wearing check
trousers. It was the late Kekewich. Pie
said: “I can neither see you nor hear you,
Mr. Brown.” In Australia, G. B. Simpson
(N.S.W.) sternly followed the English prece-
dent. For years he would hear no one who
wore what he considered the wrong Court
clothes. Then Jack Want, K.C., made a
demonstration in a violent tweed fishing
costume, and beat him. But he held out
against the weaker vessels to the end.
The Historic Memorials Committee, an
Australian institution which is entrusted
with the job of selecting and purchasing
daubs of the great men who helped to make
the Commonwealth, has rejected Lambert’s
portrait of George Reid. George did very
little for the Commonwealth except to say
“Yes-No,” and he never made a good por-
trait. His insane pride in the bow-window
of his dinner always spoiled him from an
artistic standpoint. Still Parkes and Griffith
and Dudley and Denman and Albert Gould
and Hopetoun and Northcote, who had
nothing to do with the making of the Com-
monwealth, have had their portraits
accepted, so even the worst improbability of
George Reid might have been allowed to
pass.

‘‘Floater”: Pansy La Milo Montague,
assisted by the indefatigable Cruickshank, is
now making her contours public in America.
Described as “the famous poseuse from
Great Britain,” the Melbourne Pansy is
appearing in an act wherein her bare impres-
sions of ancient divinities are supplemented
by motion pictures of herself in the newest
London and Paris frocks. The films adver-
tise Pansy in her lately-invented role of Per-
fect Lady, in which she advises on matters of
dress and “form.” Lately she assailed the
Amurkan female’s habit of carrying shopping
bags, assuring her abashed interviewer that
the_ receptacles were never handled by the
Naicest People. “Indeed,” added the god-
dess, “the bag on the Continent is the badge
of the other sort of person.” Miss Mon-
tague affects a cane herself, leaving her maid
to follow behind with her purse and bag—
and presumably incur the suspicion of being
The Other Sort of Person.
"CINDERELLA," AT
HER MAJESTY'S
MELBOURNE.
Barry Lupine
Leslie Gaze singeth
a song.
Australian mummers stand to suffer in
two ways from the war. Not only has the
demand for theatrical entertainment slack-
ened, but managers, going in for retrench-
ment, can get a supply of 'unemployed from
Europe at reduced rates, if they want ’em.
One of the first mummers to make the best
of this bad situation was Harry Halley.
He set out as agent in Victoria for an illus-
trated History of the War.
“Ami” : I knew Dan Barry well —a quiet
individual, of strong common-sense, like
Sarah Bernhardt, Coppin, Barnum, and
others who have practised the reclame, by
way of advertisement, to keep in evidence.
I often wanted him to give me racy theatrical
experiences, but he despised all that, and
would only talk about politics, sociology or
something useful. He had a Sliakspearian
kind of contempt for his avocation. As a
paymaster he was good, though what you
might call not extravagant. Still, bad winds
or fair, Dan was faithful to his little knot
of people, such as Hollyford, Rede, Stone-
ham, Hoppy Keogh and daughter, Lila
Byford, Dora Mostyn and Rita Aslin, just
as Bland Holt was to Baker, Styan, Norman,
Charley Brown, Maxwell, Miss Ross and
Harrie Ireland, with the ever-delightful and
indispensable Mrs. Bland. Off stage Dan
kept much to himself, and liked best of all
to roam about with a vagrant sort of dog.

“E.T,”: Re the “Silver King” burlesque
mentioned as having been performed by the
Brough-Boucicault co. in Australia, I recall
that Robert Brough appeai-ed in the skit
when it was done in London first of all. He
was the faithful servitor Jaikes to the
Master Will of tubby Teddy Righton. That’s
a few years ago! The burlesque was played
at the old Strand as a first piece—or was it
after-piece?—to the stage version of
Anstey’s “Vice Versa,” with “Bill” Haw-
trey and Tom Cannam prominent in it.
Cannam may also have had a part in “Silver
Guilt” (as the parody was called), but as to
that I am old enough to disremember.
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos old-time comedian J.
,C. Lambert (B. 31/12/T4). He, like H.
R. Harwood, made his first Australian ap-
pearance at Geelong (Vic.). This was in
1855. He was G. V. Brooke’s oldest theatri-
cal friend. When “G.V.” made his very first
appearance at the Theatre Royal in Dublin
Lambert was playing juvenile business
there. He was a native of the decayed Eng-
lish seaport of Wells, and, after making his
final stage appearance in Melbourne as Sir
Peter Teazle, he returned to his birthplace
to end his days—mostly on the local bowl-
ing green.
“Cherub Aloft”: The names of some scene-
painters who work chiefly in Sydney may be
added to “Carmine’s” chiefly-Melbourne list
(B. 14/1/T5). In recent years Leslie Board
has been responsible for some attractive
things. The mill scene in “The Girl on the
Film” is his latest and among his best. The
Clints and Dixon are still at work. So is
Harry Whaite, after a spell among the lakes
of Killarney, the mountains of Wales, and
other old-world landscapes. Waite and Dixon
are represented in “Seven Little Australians”
and “Dorothy o’ the Hall,” and the Clints at
the Adelphi. J. J. Ricketts, for many years
with Holloway, and afterwards with Ander-
son, is best known nowadays on the business
side, but has not altogether dropped the
brush. George Upward deserves to be re-
membered for some of the scenes in “Joseph
and His Brethren.” I think “Carmine” is
too lukewarm about J. S. Mann. It must be
remembered that Sydney Adelphi, where
Mann keeps his paint-pots, is usually a
house of quick changes. This allowed for,
he maintains a very good average. A painter
who can put forward scenery like that in
“Mr. Wu” and the wood scene of the “Babes”
has nothing to worry about. Mann is especi-
ally good with Chinese stuff. Among other
things in this line he painted last year’s
“Aladdin” for Willoughby, and provided
good stuff for a poor play in “Queen of the
White Slaves.” Not all scene-painters, by
the way, like to be called “scenic artists.”
George Gordon objected to it as affectation.
Does anyone remember Howard Russell,
the heavy villain of a thousand blood-and-
thunder dramas in his younger days, and a
respected “Drury Lane actor” since he grew
old and shaky? He died recently, aged 81,
and a good story was told of him. Charles
Reade, the author-manager, was giving out
the parts for a new play, and each member
of the co., bar Howard Russell, weighed his
“lines” as he got them in his hands, mum-
mers being disposed to estimate the value
of their parts by the number of words they
run to. Reade, angered by his co.’s contempt-
uous handling of light parts (like waiters
dumbly deriding a paltry tip), called Russell
back to ask him why he had simply put his
little portion in his pocket without trying
to guess its weight. The courtier bowed
gracefully and said, “Sir, we do not weigh
bank notes!” Which, coming from a minor
actor to the man who had written the stuff,
was an inspired reply.
“Harrison O.”: For refreshing candor I
don’t know where you could find anything
to beat the turn of Skipper Francis, at
Melbourne Bijou. S. Francis once swam
across the Bristol Channel, which is wider
at some places than at others ; and he delivers
a stirring oration descriptive of the heroic
performance. The lecturer is visibly affected
by his own eloquence when speaking of the
dangers and difficulties he overcame, and one
feels that it is only by the exercise of strong
self-control that he refrains from giving him-
self three hearty cheers. Pictures are shown
of S. Francis sparring, wrestling, saving
goals at the rate of many a minute in a
football match, running, cycling, and in the
bosom of his family. In addition to being a
great athlete and a talented father, Mr.
Francis is a gifted poet and vocalist, and
before, leaving the stage he shows our people
wherein lies thejr duty to the Empire, in a
song which, it is gratifying to record, was
written and composed entirely by himself.
Ella Airlie, who graduated at an open-air
theatre, is now with the Fuller-Brennan firm
at Melbourne Bijou. Ella sings to her own
piano accompaniment, and her enunciation
is exceptionally good. When she appeared
in a St. Kilda show, under the Taits’ man-
agement, some two or three summers back,
the bright little woman caught the seaside
audiences by the ear. The crowd at the
Fuller-Brennan house seems equally pleased
with her incisive style of singing story-songs.
“Monkbarns”: Hamlets in Australia since
the Year One: —Adams, Anderson, Arabin,
Bandmann, Barrett. Batten (Melbourne
Garrick), Bentley, Booth (Sydney, about
1861), Brooke, Byers, Buchanan, Louisa
Cleveland, Creswick, Dampier. Defries (the
Sydney Gasman), Dewhurst, Duggan (ama-
teur), Rose Edouin, Rose Evans, Fairclough,
Heir, Holt, Hoskins, Howe, Ireland, Irving,
Kean, King, Maddocks (Melbourne), Miln,
Montgomery, Nesbitt, Louise Pomeroy,
Shearcroft, Stark, Sullivan, Talbot, Waller
(of yore), Warner (two). I have not a
record of Catlicart, Dillon, Knight or Rig-
nold acting Hamlet in Australia. Frank
Cates acted it as an amateur in the little Soho
Theatre, London, with Beerbohm Tree in
a small part, and I think Flemming was in
it. At the Soho you bought your part.
Hamlet might cost you £5, Ghost £3, Laertes
£2, Polonius £l, and so on, down to half a
crown. Possibly you might walk on for a
bob. Each found his own costume. Coppin,
when about 20 years old, acted Osric to
young Brooke’s Hamlet in an English pro-
vincial town. This gave him the germ of
his idea to engage Brooke for Australia 15
years later. Brooke, growing too heavy,
seldom played Hamlet in Australia. It was
a favorite part with Clarence Holt. Bland’s
dad ; but he hardly ever enjoyed a shot at it.
David Bispham, the ex-Wagnerian singer
who visited Australia a while ago, is devot-
ing his old age to the management of a film
factory in the U.S. His declared intention
is to render in photography some 20 or 30
operas of which he has secured the bio-
graphic rights. After that he will get on
to some Adelphi dramas.
“Masetto”: Giacomo Sgambati, who
passed out last month in Rome, aged 71, was
about the best-known of modern composers
for the piano. In his boyhood he was a
superb executant, and challenged comparison
with Liszt when that master was in Italy.
Like Verdi and others of the Italian school,
he was afterwards swayed by Wagner’s
influence. He turned out a lot of works,
including a requiem on the death of King
Humbert. But his chamber music is of
the best, though Australia being moribund
to that branch of thart, this allegation, for
a while anyhow, will have to go for what it is
worth.
“C. Ockney”: Beerbohm Tree is doubling
the parts of Micawber and Dan Peggotty in
the new version of “David Copperfield,”
which he produced at his Haymarket play-
house during the Christmas season. It has
been done before, but, never satisfactorily.
If the actor is a “good double” —that is to
say, if he differentiates the two parts suc-
cessfully in both mumming and make-up—
the extreme cleverness of the proceeding is
lost to most of the kind folks in front, who
rarely study programmes. They simply
think that the two characters are played by
two different people, as is usual. If, on
the other hand, the doubling is not cleverly
accomplished, the audience spots that it is the
same man, and reckons that the management
is hard up. The present “Copperfield”
adaptation is by Louis Napoleon Parker,
adaptor also of “Joseph and His Brethren.”
A well-remembered version in Australia was
that produced bv George Fawcett Rowe, in
which that excellent comedian was content
to appear as Micawber.
From London : There is a grand Christmas
revival of “Henry V.” —George Rignold’s
finest role—at London Shaftesbury, which
is run by Robert Courtneidge, an old friend
of Australia’s. In the caste is Rose Edouin,
the Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis who managed the
Melbourne Bijou in the olden days. She
plays Mrs. Quickly, and scores. She must
be the grand old woman of the contem-
porary stage, for, as a small girl, she was in
the company of Samuel Phelps during his
famous Shakspearian revivals at Sadler’s
Wells way back in the forties of last cen-
tury. In the ’fifties she was touring Aus-
tralia as a member of the Edouin Family, of
which brother Willie became the most
famous.
“T. 0.1.”: Melbourne’s first panto, was
produced at the old Queen’s in Queen-street,
on May 13, 1850, and was for the benefit of
Charles Young. The “book,” entirely new
and local, was written by Young expressly
for this one occasion. It was entitled “The
Goblin of the Gold Coast; or Harlequina
and the Melbournites in California.” It had
not much literary merit, but it crowded the
house.
“ J.F.H.” : A London Judge has been in-
vestigating a quarrel between Yesta Vic-
toria and Moss Empires Ltd., the wealthiest
music-hall circuit in Britain. Yesta failed
to turn up at a rehearsal, and her contract
was cancelled. The jury thought this too
autocratic, and in awarding her £3250 dam-
ages took into account the fact that she had
been drawing as much as £l4O a week—for
warbling “Daddy Wouldn’t Buy Me a Bow-
Wow.” “See what Percy’s Picked up in the
Park” and other classical ditties. The
salaries of several top-liners were sworn to
during the hearing. Harry Lauder’s London
representative, giving evidence, said the
comedian’s salary in England was £OOO a
week and in America £lOOO. It was testi-
fied that he was never known to regleet a re-
hearsal, although he had complained of its
length while the taxi outside was registering
twopences against him.
The astounding salaries paid to variety
entertainers, as revealed in evidence at the
Yesta Victoria trial, recall an article in
Blackwood’s describing the London music-
hall artists of 70 years ago :
The singers are usually a prima donna or senti-
mental leader, a basso, a primo buffo, and a few
nondescripts. Six shillings is the usual nightly re-
muneration for instrumental and four shillings for
vocal performers, with a rehearsal allowance of gin
and water. Pricer of admission vary from twopence
to one shilling.
The halls were generally apartments attached
to pubs.
“Masetto”: Jean Baptiste Faure, the
great French baritone, just dead at 84, did
not long survive his famous pupil Plancon.
Faure was the originator of most of the big
baritone parts in opera written during his
singing life, notably Neluska in Meyerbeer’s
“L’Africaine,” and the name part in
Thomas’s “Hamlet.” He was the first
baritone wlio made a success of Mepliisto in
Gounod’s “Faust.” The part was written
for and was generally sung by a deep basso,
but Gounod re-wrote some of it for Faure,
and that arrangement is usually followed,
good bassos being scarce. In Australia,
Yerdi was about the best of the baritone
Mepliistos, with Julius Riinger and Rupp
close up.
One of the craft in defence: —
According to a cable, London Morning Post
describes the Australian Historic Memorials Commit-
tee’s rejection of George Lambert’s portrait of
George Reid as “grotesque treatment of an artist.’’
The picture was the most prominent feature of the
Exhibition of the Society of Modern Portrait Paint-
ers in London last year, so the critics of the great
city know all about it. Remarkable portraits have
always appeared ridiculous to the contemporary
come-by-chance. The painter who is of value i?
ages ahead of his time; but any stray is allowed
to pass judgment on his work, and to say things
about it which would be libellous if applied to a
grocer’s porridge. Confronted by a John, an Orpen,
or a Connard, this committee would become trans-
fixed with disgust. Yet those who are best qualified
to speak say that these men are great artists. Thirty
years ago the equivalents of the Historic,- Memorials
Committee said that Whistler was an “impudent cox-
comb” who was “throwing a pot of paint in the
public’s face.” Now they say that Whistler is a
great artist. They say it, not because he is great,
but because he is dead. The important artist always
comes in for “grotesque treatment” from their sort.
Rodin, El Greco, Ribera, Degas, Manet, Millet and
a legion of others, of all peoples and periods, are the
proof of it.
There was what sounded like 15 simul-
taneous dog fights at the Sydney wool sales
the other day when the selling brokers
were deaf to the bids of German
buyers operating, as they said, on United
States account. The overlooked buying
brokers howled and barked, and mentioned
the Law, but the selling brokers remained
deaf. So far as the Law is concerned, the
Germans were quite fight. For any
purpose of civil proceedings, a German resi-
dent here with the license of the Crown is
not an alien enemy; though an Australian
resident in Germany is. At the same time
the Law looks with a suspicious eye on the
transactions of Austral- or Anglo-German
firms, and has appointed a Controller to
watch things.
While Maoriland has been howling Im-
perial patriotism with its mouth, it has been
using its hand to sign a contract with the
United States to supply 10 new locos. Britain,
of course, wanted the job—it never wanted
such jobs worse—but it quoted a price a
little over the Yankee figure. So Maoriland
gives the work and the waves to the Yankee,
and the Britisher can pull his belt in another
hole. _ Of course it makes an excuse —
Britain wouldn’t undertake to supply the
goods in less than seven months, whereas the
Yankee says he will do it in 60 days.
Heaven only knows how that improves the
position. To this paper it simply sounds
like a confession of utter shiftlessness. What
sort of management is it that doesn’t know
more than two months in advance that it
will want engines?

The 1.W.W., which once threatened to
become influential by dragging in dissatisfied
trades-unionists and recalcitrant believers in
strike-at-any-price, has been digging its grave
since the war started. At first it used to
get a safe distance from volunteers and shout
“Murderers!” but it has since grown bold,
and riots have threatened to chew the ears
off several of its street meetings. A recent per-
CONCILIATED.
B INGHI: “I hear yon bin kissin ’ Myall Bill!"
GIN: “You pinny liar. I swear I ’aven’t! ”
BINGHI: “ Orright. I believe yer. But, by cripes, don't you do it again."
formance was at Port Pirie (S.A.), where one
of the “revolutionary unionists” mounted a
box and greeted the ore-smelters and refinery
hands with “Now then, you Port Pine
hooligans !” That was the end of the speech.
The crowd closed in, and the I.W.W. was
hammered through the streets by an in-
furiated crowd of about a thousand. Iwo
hours later the supply of Workers gave out
—they had crept into the police cells for
safety—and the crowd assembled and
declared the rout of the enemy hy cheering
Australia, Andy Fisher, the Empire the
defence forces and itself. Then it went home
quietly and told its wife that it had put in a
good night shift.

Heine ran the measure over the Prussian
character, with this result: —
I could not trust this Prussia, this tall, pietistic
hero in gaiters, this braggart with the capacious
maw, carrying a' -corporal’s staff which he first dips
in holy water before bringing it down on your head.
I had great misgivings about this philosophic,
Christian, military despotism, this medley of beer,
deceit and sand. Repulsive, deeply repulsive to me
was ever this' Prussia, this pedantic, hypocritical,
sanctimonious Prussia —this Tartuffe among the
nations. >

SYMPATHY AT LAST.
COUNTRY CONSTABLE (importantly): "Now, gentlemen, don't bustle ’im. ’Es thinkin'"
The news that “Germany is running short
of chloroform” recalls that in the United
States’ civil war Abraham Lincoln, acting
on the principle that all things possible should
be done to make war. terrible for the enemy,
declared all anaesthetics contraband. As the
North was able to maintain a practically
effective blockade of the Southern ports, it
was awkward for the slave-holders. No one
took much notice at the time, but what an
uproar there would be if Britain adopted
that line in regard to the people who have
been making war terrible in Belgium and at
1 Scarborough !
“Gordon G.”: It’s a joyous ass, the Law,
anyhow. Try this helping from an Act
passed in 1770: —
All women of whatever age, rank, profession, or
degree, whether virgins, maids or widows, who shall
impose upon, seduce and betray into matrimony any
of his Majesty’s male subjects by virtue of scents,
paints, cosmetics, washes, artificial .teeth, false hair,
Spanish wool, iron stays, bolstered hips, or high-
heeled shoes, shall incur the penalty of the law
now in force against witchcraft and the like, mis-
demeanors ; and the marriage under such circum-
stances, upon conviction of the offending party, shall
be null and void, and— .-
Let it go at that.

A youthful but enterprising pirate of 19
years was given an official reception at Judge
Docker’s Court, Sydney, a few days ago.
Inspired by the capture of Papua and other
Pacific islands, he decided to fit himself out
for adventure. Being short of cash he
forged orders on the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, and so procured a motor-launch in
Port Jackson and tuition in its management.
Next, he fitted out the craft with stores
and hove short preparatory to departure.
Somewhere about there a suspicious John
Waterhop arrived on the scene and returned
to town towing a dispirited Columbus. Judge
Docker gave the accused the benefit of (1)
the First Offenders’ Act and (2) a large
helping of sound but uninteresting advice.
The struggle between craft and industrial
unionism has definitely turned during - the
last few years into a series of victories for
the industrial brand. The Railway Workers
and General Laborers’ Association, started
originally as an organisation of N.S.W. nav-
vies employed on railway construction, has in
five years roped in 18,000 members, absorb-
ing sleeper-cutters and half a dozen other
crafts which had their own small associa-
tions. In the same way, amalgamation has
produced the formidable Australian Meat
Employees’ Union. The A.W.U. has ab-
sorbed'the timber-cutters, the sugar-workers,
the carriers and the rabbit-trappers, all, until
recently, isolated in separate unions. Now
there is a likelihood of these three big bodies,
together with the General Workers’ Union
of Westralia, and some others, forming a
combination to confront employers’ combina-
tions. If it comes off the membership will
be something like 100,000 and its punch will
thud down into history if it is ever landed in
earnest.
THE INTELLIGENT BATTLESHIP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
General von Mackensen christened the Dermmger.
After a rousing speech he said to the great waiting
vessel: “I commit thee, proud fabric of mens hands,
to thy element.” The band played the National
Anthem, the blocks were removed, and the ship
remained where she was. All efforts to move her
were without avail. —News item.
The General orated and the band played like the
deuce;
The people waved their beers and shouted Hocli!
The Derfflinger refused to budge: it didn’t see the use
Of moving from a comfortable dock
(A place supremely suited for a German ship to be)
And taking to the perils and discomforts of the sea.
The cultured German working-men got busy in the
ship.
They pushed and shoved it till they nearly burst.
In vain! They could not shift it half an inch along
the skip ;
It lay like some insensate triiffel-wurst,
Nor made the slightest answer to the men of weight
and worth
Who struggled to induce it to get off the safe old
earth.
The General was staggered. In his simple, forthright
view
A battleship was something that should float,
And not remain in dock or drain, with captain, guns
and crew.
The speech which follows issued from his throat:
“Go seek thy proper element, proud work of Wil-
helm’s hand” !
"I’m in it,” said the ship. “My proper element’s
the land.”

PLEASE DO NOT SPIT!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One of the Blucher’s superior officers when
rescued spat in the British officer’s face.
—-Further cabled evidence of German Culture.
To bombs and shells we don’t object r
Such modern missiles we expect.
That they are perfectly correct
We do not mind admitting.
But when from out the ocean wet
We rescue you, please don’t forget
We do not think it etiquette
When you respond by spitting.
We are a simple folk who try
To keep our city pavements dry;
Our trams and ferryboats that ply
Show of your art no traces ;
And thus we can’t retaliate —•
We have, we much regret to state,
Not learnt how to expectorate
In other people’s faces.
It is not from the coarse non-com.
That comes this cheerful clotted bomb:
’Tis gentlemen we get it from —•
. That worries us a little.
And yet we don’t your methods blame;
You merely play the German game
When at your rescuers you aim
Your cultured German .spittle.
Your guns are good, your aim is true ; ■
Cathedrals your bombardments rue,
You bomb a little child or two.
But we would not insult your
New methods of the missile wet:
It may be German etiquette;
You may, when you your venom jet,
Be spreading German Culture.

TO DEVELOP THE BUST.
A simple, safe and harmless way in which
any lady, no matter how thin or old, can in-
crease her bust development from two to five
inches in a few weeks is to take 20 grains of
phormoid, a standard Concentrated food pro-
duct, just before each meal. For conveni-
ence, it is best to ask your chemist to supply
you with the standard phormoid tablets, which
Contain 20 grains each. For a few shillings
you can get enough to last you two weeks,
during which time your bust should develop
from one to two inches. Many ladies report
five inches development in four weeks, and at
the same time marked improvement in the
general health. Phormoid is pleasant to the
taste.*

The Law is an accidental sort of ass. A
German resident of Ballarat signed a Fed-
eral electoral card prior to the last elections
representing himself as a naturalised British
subject. Nobody made any remarks, and the
thing might have been forgotten but for Bill.
Bill made trouble in Europe, whereupon the
Ballarat man suddenly desired to become a
naturalised Australian. The Law sat down,
scratched its mane with its hind hoof and
ruminated. Then it mentioned another scrap
of paper to a very surprised foreigner and
told him that a fine of £1 for making a false
declaration would meet the case.
After the lower and the higher branch of
the Law, and the law-clerk and the office
boy, and the Iv.C. and his junior, and the
Bench and its associate and its tipstaff and
its declamatory door-keeper, and all the rest
had pretty well eaten up the mouldy build-
ing in Costs, it was decided last week, by
the Privy Council that the N.S.W. State
Government was perfectly within its rights
in annexing Federal Government House,
Sydney. It is a triumph of a sort, but no
one knows exactly what to do about it.
Money is too scarce just now to allow of the
establishment of a museum or conserva-
torium of music in the old premises. The
State Governor can’t be installed there, for
a new house has been acquired with much
borrowed money for his accommodation. The
Governor-General keeps away from Sydney
for lack of a house to stay in, and this aggra-
vates the peerage of Sydney, which wants
to wear its feet out at the festive guberna-
torial dance. His Principal Excellency waits
ALMOST FATAL.
“But the operation couldn't have been a
serious one."

anyhow. ”

the same in London,
where complaint is
made that Paris is
allowed to have all its
lights full on. The
discrepancy is ex-
plainable, of course.
Just after aeroplanes
“came in,” all flying
over British towns
was _ forbidden, and
especially over Lon-
don. Just as a ship
has to get its position
with a sextant or by
dead reckoning, so an
aeroplane has to get
its position in the air.
The trifling Aldershot
dirigibles, though of
little use for fighting,
were good enough for
making aerial maps of
London, and those
aboard were the only
ones in the world who
ever had the chance to
make them. The
German, who has for
years been flying at
will over Paris, has
long since got his air
maps of that city. He
could get his bearings
there at night whether
the lights were full
ou or half out. In London he couldn’t be
accurate even in the daytime.

A special horror of the war is the Face at
the Window. The Window is generally that
of a railway carriage, and the multitudinous
Face is that of the soldier or officer who has
gone mad with the roar and suspense and
horror of it all. There are thousands and
thousands of these gibbering creatures. Some
of them will recover—it is estimated that a
promising lunatic may be patched up in
nine months or so; and a lot more won’t
recover. By the close of the war the
statistics of crazy folk will be incredible,
unless the war patients are simply put down
as retired soldiers and nothing is said about
mental failure. What a wonderful number
of things Bill of Berlin will have to reflect
on in his declining years—provided Bill is of
a reflective mood !
Melbourne’s annual morgue statistics show
that the motor hog was directly responsible
for 22 deaths in 1914, almost equalling the
23 corpses manufactured by all the suburban
railways combined. Deaths by motor are
increasing each year; during 1913 17 per-
sons were killed, and in the year previous
only 12. The number of inquests and post-
mortems last year was 701, which consti-
tutes a record. Suicides numbered 64, as
compared with 75 in 1913, which shows that
lots of people are postponing their lysol till
they see how the war goes—just as lots of
people every year postpone it till they’ve
had the result of the Cup. Bullet and
poison were still the most popular means of
despatch—l7 in each department. Others:
hanging, seven; drowning, five; miscellane-
ous, six. Miscellaneous includes the now
almost-discarded razor. This paper is glad
to see that its continued protests against
that messy and untidy method have at last
soaked in.

Brother Robinson and his Orange crowd
held a dreary demonstration in Sydney on
Anniversary Day. The bite had gone out of
the Walls of Derry, and the Boyne was a
back number. The British Empire is fight-
ing for its life against Prussia, which is
mostly Protestant and has a strongly Protes-
tant State Church; for Prussia is the head
and front of the offending. Its other enemies
are Roman Catholic or Mohammedan. Its
allies are Roman Catholic, Mohammedan,
Greek Church, Buddhist, Shinto and sun-
dries. It hopes that the Catholic States of
Italy and Portugal will join in, also the
Orthodox Greek State of Roumania. Bul-
garia, which runs a church of its own, will
be welcomed if it is willing to assist. The
mostly-Protestant United States keeps aloof.
So do Protestant Denmark, Holland, Nor-
way and Sweden. N.S.W., the most strongly
Roman Catholic State of the Commonwealth,
reckons that it is making the biggest effort
in the Commonwealth. The only insurrec-
tion which started in the British Empire
was among the Protestant Boers of South
Africa. The Pope flatly refused to give his
blessing to Catholic Austria in its war with
mostly-Protestant Britain. In fact, all the
religions have become mixed, and the annual
struggle to represent the Scarlet Woman as
the cause of all the world’s troubles lacked
its wonted enthusiasm.
The oration of “Harrison O..”':—
A cable mentions that the Cold Country Soldiers
and Sailors Families’ Association negatiVed a, pro-
posal that women should be helped upon the' produc-
tion of their marriage certificates,, hut not before a
reverend protest had been made against putting; con-
cubinage and marriage on the same footing. It is safe
to assume that the holy person’s protest was based on
moral grounds; and as morality, when not a ques-
tion of latitude and longitude, is mostly a matter
of taste and convenience, the protest, In this regard,
is worth little or nothing. At the same time there
are economic reasons why the unmarried wife should
not be placed on the same footing as the wedded
lady. The concubine is essentially a blackleg who
trusts to the generosity or otherwise of her employ-
ers, instead of demanding (marriage) union condi-
tions. The question arises: Is she any more entitled
to help than a non-unionist “free” laborer would be
to strike pay? .The concubine and the prostitute
between them have had much to do in making
marriage the comparatively ill-paid profession it
is for most women, and, in a general and economic
manner of speaking, should not receive the same
treatment as women who are in the union. It may
be granted that, having regard to the extraordinarily
upended conditions now prevailing, it is a fair thing
in many instances to disregard nice economic and
sociological considerations; neverthelesss the time is
ripe to protest, on strictly non-moral grounds, against
a growing tendency to treat the non-unionist lady
the same as the unionist wife.
President Wilson, of the United States,
will be remembered as the mildest-mannered
man who ever sat on a fence, and it is the
mildest possible milk-and-water fence that
he sits upon. Within the last few months
he has expressed his friendship for the Allies.
He has opposed any increase in Uncle Sam’s
military and naval forces lest the act should
look like hostility to Germany or to some-
one else. He has objected, but not violently,
to the conduct of the Allies in objecting to
United States trade with Germany. He has
congratulated the Kaiser on his birthday,
not because he approves of the Kaiser’s
methods but because he hates to be rude to
the maddest thing God has made. He has
urged the German ambassador at Washing-
ton to keep cool. He has taken a polite and
unbiased view of the action of his Govern-
ment in permitting the transfer of certain
German steamers to the U.S. register. And
he has hinted that his country will be glad
to mediate between the belligerents when
occasion offers —which suggests a Sunday-
school teacher standing with an olive branch
in one hand and a Thanksgiving Day turkey
in the other between a pair of maddened
elephants. The one occasion when Woodrow
Wilson, the most friendly person who ever
came with a beaming smile out of New
Jersey, did anything definite was when he
refused to recognise Huerta as President of
Mexico. Huerta was an Aztec ruffian with
spectacles, but he was a strong ruffian, and
but for United States’ opposition he might
have established a durable Government. Now
Gutierrez is President of Mexico one day,
and Carranza another, and Garza rules on
the third day, and Villa comes in next, and
all is chaos. The railways are mostly closed
and industry is practically dead. The
breakage is mainly owing to the fact that
Wilson objected to Huerta as a man
who was unfit to take round the saucer
in church and collect the peso in a righteous
spirit. The democratic President will be a
failure as a mediator. A humble and peace-
ful and unarmed person doesn’t count for
much in these days of vast collision.
Thus a man just in from Europe:—
If, as has been often said, this is to be a war of
attrition—meaning human attrition—it is commonly
held by people who only count the armies, and the
dead, and the wounded, and the prisoners, that the
combat has hardly commenced. The numbers in the
fighting lines are enormous, but the numbers that
have never got into the fighting line are far in excess.
On paper, the slaughter hasn’t really begun. The
great majority of able-bodied Frenchmen and Ger-
mans and Russians and Austrians haven’t fired a
gun. So if man could live on nothing save rain
water, and his clothes and arms and ammunition and
pay fell from Heaven, the struggle of attrition
wouldn’t be yet in the opening chapter. Unfor-
tunately the scheme of the complete nation in arms
is impracticable in a long war. Men must remain
behind to run trains and tram-cars and steamships ;
to make clothes, rifles, cartridges and cannon; to
lepair roads; to bury the dead; to help the infant
into the world ; to earn a little money in factories,
and to run banks and insurance offices, and to grow
food, and to dig in mines. Otherwise there would be
nobody to subscribe the £3011,000,000 loan when the
£300,000,000 loan is put on the market. The theory
of calling up the whole manhood of the community
is glorious as a subject of after-dinner oratory, but
unless there are at least two sturdy men at the rear
to feed and clothe and arm and finance each man at
the front, also to look after his family and belong-
ings, the man at the front is liable to become use-
less. If the whole male community went to the
front, and there was nobody left to subscribe the
war-loan save the old woman and the infant and the
cow, it would be a humble look-out for the soldier.
Despite the vast reserves of capable humanity which
still exist in theory, the war of attrition has com-
menced. Already the German banker is perishing at
his desk through the struggle to make cash out of
nothing, and many other exhausted soldiers of the
rear are finding the burden too heavy for them.

HOW TO HAVE LONG,
BEAUTIFUL HAIR.
By a Hair Specialist.
It is not hard to stop the hair from falling
out and promote its growth if the right
means are used. There is no hope for the
scalp where the hair roots are dead and the
scalp is shiny. However, to those who have
not reached this condition, immediate steps
should be taken to stop it before it is too
late. Here is a simple recipe which you can
make at home, that will stop the hair from
falling out, promote its growth and eradi-
cate scalp eruptions and scalp humors. To
a half-pint of water add loz. bay rum, a
small box of Orlex Compound and ioz. of
glycerine, and apply to the hair, rubbing
with the finger tips', two or three times a
week. These ingredients can be obtained
ac any chemist’s at very little cost, and
mixed at home. This recipe not only pro-
motes the growth of the hair, but darkens
streaked, faded grey hair and makes it soft
and glossy.* [9
HAVE YOU a BAD LEG
perhaps surrounded with inflammation and
swollen, that when you press your finger on
the inflamed part it leaves the impression?
If so, under the skin you have poison, which
defies the remedies you have tried. Per-
haps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated, the same with the ankles, round
which the skin may be discolored, the disease,
if allowed to continue, will deprive you of
the power to walk. You may have attended
hospitals and been told your case is hopeless,
or advised to submit to amputation, but do
not. Try the great British Remedy:—

Dr. Westhaeffer, who has been investigat-
ing the diseases of the peoples of the South Seas,
ascribes the transmission of elephantiasis (which is
very prevalent in the Samoan group) to a mosquito
similar to the little devil that spreads yellow-fever.
White residents who remain continuously for long
periods in the islands are not exempt, and the investi-
gator reckons the only way to shake off an attack is
to hit out for a temperate climate before the swell-
ings become permanent. Yaws, a disease which pro-
duces a crop of running sores, highly contagious, is
also very common amongst the Samoans, who enter-
tain about it a similar superstition to that which
some white people hug about measles —that it is an
inevitable ailment, and should be suffered and done
with in childhood. To this end the disease is fre-
quently deliberately brought about by contact between
healthy and infected children.

Billy was the last of what was known as the Leigh
tribe of aboriginals, and he flickered out not long
ago at a good age, although nobody knows exactly
how much it amounted to. Billy, known and liked
by everybody in the Geelong district, was in the
service of the Armvtage family, who have put up the
monument. The words describe him as a friend of
the family for over 60 years. An epitaph by Harry
Armytage, ex-M.L.A., is engraved on the tomb. When
the then Governor unveiled the Flinders memorial
at the summit of the You Yangs, near Little River,
Billy Leigh was one of the principal guests, and
showed his Ex. how to make a speech.
* * * *
This is how Bill wrote home about it: —•
Yorta seen one of them fly Sydney tram-conductors
taken down a treat on Christmas Eve. I was ridin’
in a car up William-street, an’ there was a bloke, a
tart an’ a young girl about 13 all got in together.
“Fares, please,” says the guard. “Two twos an’ a
one,” says the bloke, handin’ him a tray an’ two
coppers. “Another penny, please,” says the guard.
“That girl’s over 12.” The bloke just smiles an’ says
again, “Two twos an’ a one.” “Another penny for
that girl,” says his nibs, short. “Two twos an’ a
one,” sings the bloke, like a bloomin’ chorus. The
conductor clears off an’ brings an inspector. “You’ll
have to pay another penny for that young lady, sir,”
says he. “She’s over age.” “Two twos an’ a one,”
chants the bloke, still wearin’ his bright smile.
At last the inspector says: “Give him his two twos
an’ a one an’ take his name.” The boy passed over
his monniker like a toff, an’ took his two greens and
a pink. Next stop was top of William-street —end of
the penny section. The bloke hands the two greens
to the two tarts an’ says: “I get out here, conduc-
tor, but the ladies is travellin’ two sections. Take
care of ’em, please, an’ put ’em off at the right
place.”
“Lagani-N.”: For lime-making for build-
ing purposes, such South Sea Islanders as use lime
prefer the close, cauliflower-shaped madrefiora variety
of coral. This they dive for and break off from the
live reef-bed. Some of the knobs are six feet
through. They are first smashed into small pieces,
then a big pit is dug, a pile of firewood as high as
a man is raised therein, and the coral is spread a
foot deep on top. As the heap subsides and the
flames die down the heat is sometimes sealed in by
means of a light layer of earth over coarse matting.
Tbe lime which is eaten with betel-nut is almost
invariably burnt from shells.
“Calabash”: Re “The Oldest Inhabitant’s”
story of the shooting of Constable Nelson by bush-
ranger Dunn at Collector (N.S.W.) half a century
ago (B. 14/1/’l5). Some years back an aged and
dishonored man of that locality told it to me this
way. The bushrangers were at the pub—Hall and
Gilbert below in the bar, and Dunn on guard on
the balcony facing the town. Dunn saw Constable
Nelson approaching along the road, carbine in hand,
and when the officer was three chains away ordered
him to “bail up.” The order was not obeyed, and
Dunn shot his man. The part of the business that I
could never understand was why Nelson should prefer
to advance along an open road when he could have
made use of a rocky knoll, clothed with scrub and
leading down almost to the back door of the pub.
Nelson’s bravery is unquestioned, but his strategy
called for improvement.
KNEW THE SYMPTOMS.
LOVER OF NATURE : " Ah, my friend, how well you must know the face of Nature in all
its moods. Have you not seen the sun sinking in such a glare of glory that it
swallows up the horizon with fire? Have you not seen the mist gliding down
the hilltop like a spectre? Have you not seen the moon struggling to shake off
the grip of the ragged, rugged storm-cloud?”
BILL THE FISHERMAN: “No. I'm on the water-waggon now.”
“Outcast” : The Papuan custom of supply-
ing visitors with a lady companion (B. 1/10/’l4) is
still going strong from the Dutch boundary to the
Purari Delta, and for at least a couple of hundred
miles up the Fly River. At one time traders could
do absolutely no business unless they agreed to be
burdened with a lady companion. So far I have
heard of no bankruptcies.

“Paddy Melon”: Amongst the S. Aus-
tralian and West Queensland aboriginals, “pitchery,”
whether to chew or smoke, is a big-fella luxury. It
grows in good quantities out on the Mulligan, a sand-
bed in the south-west corner of Queensland, and the
Diamantina blacks make periodical trips to collect
it. It is chiefly used for chewing, but generally
after being chewed, rechewed and chewed again a
few times it is mixed with a bit of cured tobacco
and smoked. In times when it is scarce any old
buck who has run out will give you anything he
may possess (bar his dogs, and he never has much
more) for the smallest parcel of the herb. He will
even lend you his gin to wash your clothes, etc. Par-
ticularly etc. For years past—perhaps for hundreds of
years—Goyder’s Lagoon, on the Diamantina (S.A.),
has been a great rendezvous for a pitchery cor-
roboree. Every year large numbers of the S. Aus-
tralian blacks meet there to greet their Queensland
cousins, who always come loaded with the vegetable.
I have seen as many as 500 of all ages meet at the
lagoon, and for a partly civilised region 500 is a
big mob.

“Lagani-N.”: The Santa Cruzians (and
I believe the remote Tahitians) preserve their
surplus bread-fruit in subterranean silos. When the
fruit is ready it is peeled, and, freed from seeds,
is piled in a heap to ferment. Meanwhile a hole
is dug, and lined with big green leaves of the tree,
and into this the fruit, mashed to a sticky con-
sistency, is put. Then more leaves are placed on
top, and the hole is filled in and sealed with clay.
When other supplies fail the silos are opened up,
and the mush is mixed with sago or grated cocoanut,
wrapped in leaves, baked in ashes and eaten. There
are about 50 varieties of breadfruit. Usually it is
about three times as big as a cricket ball, with the
skin marked with slightly elevated circles, like a
golf ball. The pulp is greyish-white, with about a
dozen walnut-sized seeds scattered through it. The
trees, which have serrated leaves, grow to a great
size, and yield tons of the useful vegetables. The
bark, beaten under water, is made into one of the
commonest tappa cloths.
Inserted in the Dalby (Q.) Herald
(9/l/’l5), more in sorrow than in fury:—
PUBLIC NOTICE.
I, the undersigned, wish to inform the public and
general that I am not in Brisbane Gaol, and not
likely to get there, as some low culprit is spreading
lies around that I, on three different occasions, bea.t
and ill-treated my wife, and she ran away from her
home, and that I am in Brisbane Gaol. Also some
skunk is spreading lies that some man gave me a
terrible hiding down here. That is all false, as I
never had a wrong word with a man down here. My
wife never left her home ; she is still living at ,
with live children, and my two sons and myself are
down there taking care of our stock through the
drought. I am proud to inform you all that I never
in my life raised my hand to strike my wife, so all
fair and honest-minded people can see what cruel,
wicked, lying people we have still living in our
district.-—(Signed) .

“Ysabel”: As the Maoriland weka, or
woodhen, is fast on the road to extinction, Parliament
is to be asked to protect it by special legislation.
The practically wingless bird has been dying in very
great numbers in the last few years. For some time
his destruction was put down to stoats and weasels,
but, while there is little doubt that these pests are a
factor, bushmen now state that they have dis-
covered the real cause of the trouble. There is, they
claim, an insect, something like a sheep tick, which
fastens itself into the bird just where the neck joins
the head. The bird’s attempts to scratch it off make
a wound, and from this the weka dies in a month or
two. Eighty per cent, of dead wekas found are said
to have this wound in the back of the neck. In 1911
hundreds died, and this year the trouble is recurring.
The insect is said to be larger and a bit darker in
color than the sheep tick, and his reputation is just
about as good. How “special legislation” is going to
give it to him in the neck I haven’t yet heard.

“Tbe Oldest Inhabitant’s” lament:—
Careless habit is changing the names of many
Australian historic places. Of late, Panbula, so
spelled for 70 years at least, has been altered to
Pambula. Milson’s Point was originally Milsom’s.
Now, I see, Cootamundra or Cootamundry is
“Coota” in railway-travellers’ language, and for
the first time I find it clipped so in metropolitan
print.
THE BEER OF VICTORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a summer afternoon,
Old liaspar’s drink was done,
In hope to fill his pewter soon
He blithered in the sun.
His lies, as very well he knew,
The beer of wandering tourists drew.
“It was the English,” Kaspar said,
“Who messed and marred our show ;
And, over graves of German dead,
AVith heavy blow on blow
Smashed in the bolted German door
And dragged the Kaiser round the floor.”
A British cotton prince arose,
His glance was proud and free,
A glance that said: “The whole world owes
A heavy debt to me.”
Three times old Kaspar’s mug he filled
AVith beer in Britain's honor spilled.
The sun was sinking in the west,
The cotton prince was gone,
And in his place of evening rest
The ancient blithered on;
For beer is beer, as all agree,
In spite of death and victory.
“It was the Frenchmen,” Kaspar said,
“That in our evil hour,
With beating drum and pelting lead,
O’erthrew the Prussian power.
Had fiery France withheld her blood
The name of England had been Mud.”
Uprose a wight who wore an inch
Of hair above his chin.
The ancient’s words appeared to clinch
The faith his soul within.
To France’s glory, high and clear,
He bought a heedless mass of beer.
The stars came out above the trees,
Dusk shadows filled the land ;
Old Kaspar lounged in pleasant ease,
His pewter in his hand.
The Frenchman gay with pride had gone,
And still the ancient blithered on.
“It was the Russians,” Kaspar said,
“AVhose countless armies smote
Our vaunted valor on the head,
And drove it like a goat.
For what had France and England done
Save for the battles Russia won?”
Old Kaspar looked among the crowd,
He searched it far and near ;
But saw no bearded Russian proud
To pledge his race in beer.
“Alas!” said he, “that thirst should be
The price of such a victory!”

PEBECO
Tooth Paste.
If our teeth could talk —they
would say something like this:
“Yes, Ave are thankful for our
friends—the millions of Tooth
Brushes. They do a splendid
work —so far as they go. We
are grateful for the hundreds of
dentifrices. They in turn do a
splendid work—so far as they go.
But both together fall far short of
protecting our enamel —our only
weapon of tooth protection. Is
there no escape from these
‘MOUTH AClDS’—these ever-
present mouth fluids which, un-
seen, unbidden, are working day
and night to break down our
armor plate—and then make the
soft inside tooth structure easy
prey to decay-germs?”
We answer:
“There IS escape from ‘Acid
Mouth.’ Pebeco Tooth Paste is
the one dentifrice to-day which
prevents ‘Acid Mouth’ —the direct
cause of 95 % of all tooth-decay.”

AN INTERESTING
EXPERIMENT.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. 11.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, or younger years.
Dr. B. ALLEN’S (u.s.a.)
Mexican WALNUT STAIN
is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,
mercury, silver, sulphur, etc., and is equally suitable
for Ladies’ Hair, or Hair of the Beard or Moustache.
“The Reefer” : Here are a few of the things
made by the Papuans out of bamboo: Beheading
knives, arrows, pourri-pourri boxes, smoking pipes,
lime pots, Pandean pipes, drums, combs, water bottles
and hairpins. They boil water in bamboo ; and one
up-to-date village has laid a line of bamboo pipes to
drain a swamp. The white man also finds bamboo
handy. At Lakekamu the miners use it as a launder
for fluming water from a race over a gully. AVhen

THE UNRELIABLE SEX.
MABEL: “ What's the matter with the Major? He seems to be more of a woman-hater
than ever.”
PERCY : “Oh, he got beaten on four queens last night.”
“F.M.” : While tightening up the guy ropes
of my tent I noticed a curious thing. A little round
trapdoor opened in the ground and a spider emerged,
evidently with the intention of putting
an edge on his appetite by a walk before
breakfast. He was a middle-aged and
, highly-respcctable spider with a wife and
family, and I could see had been asked
to call at the butcher’s and bring home
something tasty for breakfast. He started
investigating a cigarette-butt I’d thrown
on the ground, and when he got his
coat-tails singed he swore horribly and
lost all interest in the pursuit of know-
ledge on the subject of tobacco. Just as
he turned the corner round a matchbox
he almost fell over a tender young fly.
Before she could recover from the shock
he swatted her over the head with his
club, wrapped the coipse up carefully
and started for home. When he’d retired
downstairs he shut the little round door ;
but that didn’t prevent me hearing him
tell the missus they’d have stewed fly
with ant sauce. When I opened the
trap with my penknife a few minutes
later, Mr. and Mrs. Spider and the Spiderettes were
just sitting down to breakfast; and after grace had
been said by little Jimmy you should have seen them
make that fly disappear.
“Huflin - Guffin”: My dairy-farmer’s
daughter is going to be married. She is, of course,
happy. She will have a holiday in Melbourne—the
very first she has ever had in her 20 years of dairy-
farm life. Hitherto, she has never travelled in a
train, though living within a few miles of a railway.
No time to go away—“ The milkin’,” you know. She
has never looked on the sea, though it is only 50
miles away—couldn’t leave the cows for so long a
journey. Now she will have a rest from the cows
fpr a whole week or 10 days. And, after that, there
will be different cows. They will be her husband’s.
So she is, naturally, very happy. But her joy is
tinged. Her elder sister, who was married a few
years ago, gave 16 years unremitting service to the
cows. She will have completed 12 years only. Given
a fairer chance she might have broken Nell’s record.
It could have been done, for instance, if she had
started milking earlier than eight years old. Thus is
life is interrupted bv mere weddings.
THE BEER WARRIORS.
ONE OF THEM: “ Well, here's success to our

“De Oriel”: In regard to “S.R.” (B.
10/12/T4) and his midget post office at Longly
(Tas.). I can name several in Appleland that will
almost go inside that one. Castle Forbes Bay, Old
Strathblane, Jericho, Gould’s Country, Detention and
Sisters’ Creek have such tiny offices that if two
people push inside they crowd out the girl post-
mistress.

Mr. Editor, isn’t the whole game sufficiently hypo-

Don’t think it’s Bill the Butcher’s feats that make

“Bill Bowyang” : The needle bush, which
grows on the sandhills and red giound in the Darr
and Diamantina (Q.) country, will, if properly used,
give enough water to save a man’s life. Natives of
the western plains know it well, and its virtues
entitle it to a whole publicity department. A mate
of mine, after his first investigation, refused to
believe this. He took a spade, dug down a foot and
struck the roots. These he cut, but no water came.
However, he took them home and showed them to
an old black-gin. She peeled the bark off them, put
one end of a root in her mouth, sucked it for some
time, and then shook the root in his face, sprinkling
him with water. A good way to get the water out
is to peel the longest root procurable (roots two or
three feet long may be got) ; put one end into a
billycan and the other end into the mouth, and blow.
It is surprising the quantity of water that will exude.
The liquid is clear, and has very little taste. The
plant has no leaves, but is covered all over with
needle-like thorns. A pear-shaped nut also grows on
it. The vegetable is very common —there is hardly
any red ground without it.
Th’ Arrest of Terence Byrne.
(WITH APOLOGIES TO “EDDYSON.")
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ | "V ’YE mind Terence Byrne, th’ great

circumlocution is to me? Pill up that glass
iv yours with begorra —ye’ll find it good, so
ye will —an’ I’ll raysume my cogitations
about this larrge onaisy lump of a Terence).
“Well, as I was about to re-marrk, this
great onaisy lump iv a man was sittin’ there
one fine bright day, thinkin’ iv nothin’ an’
doin’ the same with great iligance, whin up
come a few bits iv b’ys in uniform with bay-
nits in their hands an’ a look of martial an’
onraisonable fury in their eyes. They were
directed by a small child wid a gurrl’s eye-
brow on th’ lip just foreninst his nose.
‘Halt!’ says th’ child, an’ th’ division
comes to a standstill an’ remains there as
still as angils on th’ Day iv Judgment. ‘Are
you,’ says the child, addhressin’ th’ brave
Terence, ‘are you th’ person who calls him-
self Terence Byrne?’
“ ‘Oi am!’ says Terence, shiftin’ his ili-
phant’s feet onaisyly.
“Th’ child dhraws a bit iv blue paper from
his pocket. ‘I have here,’ says he, ‘I have
here a warrant for your arrest!’
“ ‘What’s th’ cliarrge ?’ roars th’ great
onaisy lump, shiverin’ an’ shakin’ an’ so
spoilin’ th’ vocal effect.
“ ‘Obstructin’ Aboriginalities,’ reads th’
officer-child, as ca’m as you please. ‘Ob-
structin’ Aboriginalities, forgin’ th’ Irish
language an’ false pretences !’
“ ‘False pretences iv uihatf’ wails th’ dis-
consolit Terence.
“ ‘False pretences in pretendin’ to be
Irish !’ schnaps th’ child, an’ makes a sign to
his mates with th’ baynits. Then, before
you could repeat th’ names of all the kings
of Leinster, they storms Terence and stands
him on his head, an’ a snowstorm of sacret
rayports to the Kaiser falls out of his
clothes, and continues to fall till th’ escort
was ankle-deep in them. It was more like
arrestin’ a post-office than a man.
“Well, whin th’ storm was over an’ th’
sound iv rushin’ paper an’ plans iv forts an’
troop-shins had died down enough for a mild-
mannered man to make himself heard, th’
officer-child looks th’ pris’ner in th’ eye, an’
says he. ‘What have you got to say for your-
self?’ ‘This,’ says the pris’ner, mighty hum-
ble an’ lookin’ empty, as well he might.
‘That I am not raysponsible for my own
creation, nor for what I do, nor how I snake.
lam not an Irishman, an’ never was. I am
not a German spy, an’ never was. I just
made thim plans in me spare time, so that,
if any Irishman lost his temper with me
through me takin’ up space an’ misusin’ his
language, I could get away from him before
he killed me for a fraud. An’ now, sir,’ says
Terence, ‘will ye please let me go while you
go seek Misther Eddyson, th’ author of my
bein’? An’, sir, if you happen to be Irish,
sir, an’ my manner iv spakin’ is offinsive an’
contimptible to your ears, I would ask you
to rimimber that it is none of mv doin’, y’r
honor.' So, takin’ pity on th’ poor boy, they
‘wint away an’ lift him gatherin’ up his spy-
papers at th’ dure iv th’ bark hut where th’
Aboriginalities is kept, an’ if they saw
Mishter Eddyson, nothin’ came of it, for, as
ye see for y’rsilf (an’ God’s blessin’ on you
f’r givin’ a poor, tiresome man a patient
hearin’!) we are all workin’ overtime with-
out let or hindrance, an’ doin’ our best wid

The vacant S. Aus. school inspectorship
has been given to B. S. Roach, who is just 50,
and seven years ago was released from teach-
ing to run the Children’s Hour. This is
not the sort of publication in which a mythi-
cal Aunt Maria encourages self-conscious
kids to advertise themselves and their pet
pussy. It is a guide to good literature of the
kind which Roach himself loves—and occa-
sionally lectures about to teachers—and is
claimed to be the best publication of its class
in Australia. Come to think of it, 8. Aus.
frequently makes that claim. Roach was
born 50 years ago at Penwortham, the South
Australian old English-looking village founded
by the ill-fated explorer Horrocks, who lies
in the churchyard there.

• Drank Lethbridge, just passed out
in Maoriland, was not a brilliant political
strategist, he stopped a few Parliamentary
shindies in his time. One of the chief duties
he imposed upon himself was to hand a bag of
lollies round on the nights of angry debates,
and members got so soothed munching these
sweetmeats that they forgot to snarl at each
other. No one can tell how many riots
were thus averted by Lethbridge and his
modest bag of chocolate almonds. His main
business in life was farming, and his prin-
cipal virtue was gentleness.
T. R. Toby, a Tasmanian, knows more
about the Equator than' any member of the
Geographical Society. For 20 years or there-
abouts he has been chasing tin in Malaysia,
and for five years, on and off, lived at Ponti-
anak, in West Borneo, where the Equator
line is marked in pebbles down the main
street. Proceeding from his camp to the
club for dinner the Pontianak man would
probably walk parallel with the Equator, but
coming home at night he might wobble
casually from side to side of the earth’s
centre. During one voyage from a banquet
lie might, in fact, cross the line a dozen
times, or even oftener if he went back to
fetch his brolly.

Colonel 11. B. Lassetter has been gazetted
a Brigade Commander in England. He is
Australian-born, a grandson of Launcelot
Iredale, who founded an ironmongery busi-
ness in Sydney in 1820, and was thus the
pilot fish of the present firm of Lassetter
and Co. The new Brigadier, who was edu-
cated mostly in England, joined the 38th
regiment (the Staffordshire) as second
lieutenant in 1880, and has since then done
more soldiering than storekeeping. His active
service consists of the Nile Expedition
(medal, clasp and bronze star) and the S.A.
campaign (medal and clasp and C. 8.). He
is 55 years of age, and in 1891 married a
daughter of the late .T. M. Antill, son of
that Major Antill who came to Australia
with Governor Macquarie.
Ritchie, S. Australia’s new Minister for
Works, doesn’t use a mere shovel
when he wants to heap adulation on
a Governor. Willunga had its rail-
way opened lately, and his Ex. Gal-
way waved the green flag to the first loco-
motive that ran the road officially. Ritchie
was so lost in admiration of the statesman-
like flag-flapping of Galway that for him only
superlatives met the case. “South Aus-
tralia,” said he, “had been fortunate in
regard to Governors; and if perfection was
ever to be found in man upon the earth, they
would have to look for it in one of the
Governors of the State.” The Bulletin
doesn’t know which particular Governor it
was that owned perfection ; but, as a rough
guess, was it Billy Robinson?
The new South Aus. bishopric,
to include all the northern and
western parts of the State, has
been offered to Gilbert White,
Bishop of Carpentaria for the past
15 years. The new see is Will-
oc-hra. that name 'being chosen
largely on the lamentable argu-
ment that, when you go a-begging
in England, something aboriginal
will fetch in more donations than,
for instance, “Flinders.” Bishop
White is a tall, thin, scholarly-look-
ing man of nearly 60, and a living
testimonial to the North Australian
climate. He came from Oxford to
Charters Towers for his health. 30
years ago, and has seldom been
south of Brisbane since. When
appointed to Carpentaria (which
includes the Northern Territory
and North Queensland) he made the over-
land journey to Darwin along
the telegraph route; and for years past he
has resided in Thursday Island, as a handy
place for getting about his scattered
dominions.
According to the family records, John
Bodey, father of George, a South Australian
M.P., is in his 105th year. He lives at
Camperdown (Vic.), and enjoys a rare glass
of whisky as much as lie did 80 years ago.
Surgeon-Major Hinton, of North Adelaide,
will be 102 in March next. Mrs. Foote, of
Walkerville, near Adelaide, is enjoying re-
markably good health at 101. And Henry
Rosewarne, a Cornishman living near Adel-
aide, hopes to become a centenarian in April.
In Sydney the other day George Reid was
committed for trial on a charge of assault-
ing one Barton and robbing him of a watch
and chain and money to the value of £l5.
According to evidence, Barton chased and
caught Reid, and the watch and chain and
half the money were found in Reid’s pockets.
Some slapdash historian of the future will
cite this as a dreadful instance of what pub-
lic life became shortly after Australia had
been ruined by Federation.
“Tomato” Jessep’ has been made Grand-
master of the Orange Kennels of N. S. Wales
vice Brother Robinson, ill. The Popes of this
institution are an undistinguished lot. Robin-
son was chiefly noted for his baldness; Jes-
sep’s liens on fame are his bull-like voice and
his calling-—that of banana merchant. He
sat for Waverley in the State House for
years, almost entirely on the Orange ticket.
Then Colonel Onslow, having successfully
opposed him as an Independent, briskly
transformed himself into a fervent party-
man. whereupon the Wadeites ceased to have
any use for their old Derry friend.
Gordon Inglis, the Sydney Grammar
School boy who wrote that admirable work,
“Sport and Pastime in Australia,” has got
off his stool in the Commonwealth High Com-
missioner’s office in London and gone to the
front. Fred W. Cutlack, the young Austra-
lian who came out on board the flagship
Australia, wrote up the voyage and returned
to George Reid’s office, has also gone to the
war as a commissioned officer.
At last the movement to erect a statue in
Adelaide to the memory of Capt. Sturt has
taken substantial shape. The Adelaide com-
mittee has deputed the new Agent-General
and others in London to negotiate with an
English sculptor for a bronze. The explorer
is to be represented standing in his corduroy
trousers, with belt, loose blue shirt, cabbage-
tree hat and high boots. On February 4,
1829 —86 years ago to-day—Sturt discovered
the Darling River.
Delfosse Badgery, who has been scouring
the clouds over Sydney and suburbs during
the past three weeks, is an Australian native
aged 24 years.. Some time ago lie migrated to
England, studied aviation, and, returning to
Australia, constructed the monoplane in which
he has been floating aloft. The driving
power in the ’plane is a British 40-45h.p.
Anzani engine. The Australian has added
equipment which enables a start to be made
without an army of assistants, and lifts the
machine off its wheels after a run of less
than 20ft. Badgery lias demonstrated his
fearlessness by altitude flights of 12,500 ft. at
Goulburn (N.S.W.), 4000 ft. over Mount
Wellington (Tas.), and in Victoria. He has
offered himself and machine to the Common-
wealth for war service.
David Moorhead, an old Victorian inky
wayfarer, passed out last week in his 91st
year. David, who left the distresshful coun-
try as a youth, mined the Melbourne Stock
Exchange in 1861 and outlived all the
“bulls” and “bears” of that period. For
some years he was mining rep. of the Argus
at Bendigo and elsewhere, then joined the
Bendigo Independent, but finally deserted
the press to become registrar of the
Bendigo School of Mines. Of late years he
had lived in retirement, but right up to the
end he was an omnivorous reader and a
respectable elocutionist. The latter short-
coming was inherited by one of his daughters,
the Titian-liaired girl who was known on
tlie stage as Maisie Maxwell before becoming
“Pomona” of the Melbourne Herald’s page
for women.
There seems to be a subtle connection
between culture and haggis. When Mel-
bourne Uni. decided to import a Professor
of Literature it brought R. S. Wallace from
Scotland. Now Wallace is leaving for the
ditches, and another Scot. Archie Strong, of
Melbourne Herald, has been chosen to act
for him, while Strong’s place as lecturer
in English is to be taken by another Cale-
donian. the Rev. F. Sinclaire, whose long
hair often causes him to be mistaken for a
poet, when in reality he is merely a Socialist.
A fourth Scot, the brilliant Walter Murdoch,
was for years lecturer in English literature
before the appointment of a professor was
decided on. and would have had the job had
he not been suspected by the Senate
of having become almost an Australian.
Perth University promptly grabbed him and
intends keeping him.
Australian Art is well represented where
rose-colored flame and green smoke of burst-
ing shells will soon be working new color-
effects. One night recently there met, in a
tent in Egypt, Jack Sommers, Jim Mac-
donald, G. F. Benson and one of the younger
McCubbins. Cartoonist Ted Colles was on
his way to join them, and a few others are
thinking hard about it.

Father O’Reilly, whose name was in every-
body’s mouth during the last N. S. Wales
elections, is off to Ireland —it may be for
years and it may be for ever. During the
dozen years that he has been president of
St. Stanislaus, at Bathurst, he has supported
Labor with cheerful vigor. It is true he
opposed Holman last time, going even into
Holman’s electorate to do it; but that was
not because he loved Holman less but be-
cause he loved Labor more. lie is one of
the cheeriest and most persistent fighters
that Australia has known. He will fight
anyone about anything at any time, and he
never lets go and never stops smiling. He
has been appointed President of St. Vin-
cent’s College, Castlenock, Dublin. In, a
month or so Australia will hear sounds of
conflict from the neighborhood of the' Irish
Sea. It will not be the Germans. It will
mean simply that Father O’Reilly has begun
to settle down in his new job.

it contained any weak-sighted citizens to
speak of. Its early fathers mostly

This paper has much child-like faith, but not
enough to make it believe that Sweet Wil-
liam of Potsdam hasn’t really affected the
Q.N.’s earnings; yet the disclosed profits
have gone up still further, instead of climb-
ing down. What has probably happened
is that so much has been clipped off in the
past to provide for contingencies, that, the
business being normally better than it was
even six months ago, the management sees
no reason why the profits also should not
now be made to appear better. It simply
means, if this theory is correct, that rather
less than usual was clipped off the true
profits last half-year, and put aside for con-
tingencies. Certainly, the war shouldn’t
have seriously affected the Q.N. It no
doubt cut down its London exchange earn-
ings ; but there was no drought to intensify
the trouble, and the meat and sugar mar-
kets, in which Queensland is so much inter-
ested, were unusually firm.
Apart from the steady growth of the
profits, the most interesting thing about the
Q.N. is the progress made in wiping out the
debt which stands between shareholders and
dividends. When the boom broke in the
early ’nineties and the Q.N. had to throw
itself on the mercy of its creditors, things
looked so bad that one-fourth of the private
deposits were written off’ —to this extent, at
any rate, that they were only to be repaid
out of future profits; and until they were
repaid no dividend was to be declared. The
repayment has been a long process ; but you
can’t make a rule-of-tliree sum of it, because
in the earlier years the bank had to provide
for large payments to the Government, which
was also a creditor. Besides, it was at that
time specifically writing down its assets,
though of course the effect of paying credi-
tors out of profits has been to write down
assets all along. The shareholder can see
what progress has been made lately by this
table :—•

The “special” Is. in 1913 is not traceable in
the directors’ reports, and the total amount
then paid is consequently an estimate. The
directors at the time expected that another
“special” shilling would be available in
1916 —apparently from recoveries, or con-
tingency reserves not required, and other
odds and ends.
In four years 6s. has been paid and
enough accumulated to pay another 6d. At
that rate, as there is still 9s. 6d. to pay, it
would be about six years before the end
would come. But there is no telling what
“special” payments may be made out of
hidden reserves. Anyhow, evidently to
prepare the way, the bank, whose paid capi-
tal is now only £480,000, is taking power to
make it £2.000,000. The present authorised
capital is £1,000,000, in 200.000 shares of
£5. The issued shares are 160,000, and the
amount paid on them £3. The resolution
will thus permit of the issue of 240,000 new
shares. It is proposed to do it gradually,
giving shareholders the first call on the new
issues. It may be taken almost for granted
that there will be an issue before the first
dividend is paid. A 10 p.c. div. on the
present capital would call for only £24,000
a half-year; and on recent performances the
Q.N. can certainly do more than that.
The co.’s creditors are extraordinarily well
protected. Apart from the interminable
stock, which is fixed capital, the bank owes
£7,002,112. and it holds no less than
£4,128,837 liquid. With affairs more settled
it could with perfect safety give much
further assistance in the development of the
State with which it is so closely bound.
That is another way of saying that, even on
its present resources, it hasn’t reached the
limit of its earning power yet.

This bank had one bit of luck, at any
rate: Bill of Berlin didn’t upset the
pot till this institution was ready.
Until two or three years ago there were
plenty of people who had very gloomy ideas
about it. How gloomy indeed was the view
expressed on ’Change may be judged by the
fact that as late as 1911 shares £8 paid
were sold for as little as £4 4s. The fact
was the management had never taken either
the public or the shareholders into its confi-
dence. All that was known was that the
bank had made heavy losses which had not
been provided for by writing down capital,
and how things really stood nobody knew
who wasn’t behind the counter. Fortu-
nately things began to improve pretty
rapidly in 1911, and in a burst of candor
the chairman at last told shareholders in
January, 1914, that the position of the bank
was never stronger. So public confidence
has been gradually creeping back; and the
£8 shares which in 1911 sold at £4 4s. had
reached £7 ss. by the middle of 1914. With
confidence thus restored, the bank was appar-
ently not at all worried when in the first few
days of the war some patriots went so far
as to draw gold and hide it away in Safe
Deposits.
This next table shows how well the City
stands now, after six months’ war, compared

The hank thus holds actually more deposits
than it did 12 months ago; and, though cus-
tomers have also had a little more help, it
has more liquid assets in hand than it had at
the end of 1913. The year’s momevents in
all three lines —deposits, advances and liquid
assets —are quite satisfactory. The propor-
tions are also safe and reasonable. For every
£lOO which it owes to depositors and otho<’«
it has £34 in cash, etc., and for every £lOO
of debt not represented by liquid assets it
has £135 of other securities. There was a
time, doubtless, when many of these securi-
ties were over-valued. But a gradual pro
cess of exchange has been going on, old
securities being got rid of and the proceeds
put into new advances based on modern
values. The chances are therefore that the
present assets are little if at all over-valued,
provided that there hasn’t to be any forced
and hurried realisation. And there is no
reason whatever why there should be any-
thing like that.
Certainly the war will pinch us for a
while; but in the end Australia is much
more likely to gain commercially than to
lose, and some of its gains will come quickly,
too. Whether the City is quite so well
qualified t« scramble for those gains as some
other banks is another matter. For example :
Dec.,’o4. Dec.,’l4.
r, i Com. of Sydney, £12,203,410 £23,083,340
Deposits city of Sydney, 1,082,745 2,035,391
(Com. of Sydney, 8,708,162 14,851,834
Advances oity of Sydne y ; 1,128,848 1,603,596
It is quite true that of those two banks
which confine themselves to N. S. Wales the
City shows just about as big a proportionate
growth as the Commercial. But also con-
sider that while the City has been increas-
ing its advances bv less than half a million,
the Commercial has put over six millions on
to its little lot.

In the other States there have been good
patches here and there; but Victoria has
been all bad. For every 100 bushels of
wheat reaped in 1913 N. S. W r ales had for
the past harvest 41 bushels, S. Aus. 27
bushels, and Westralia 25 bushels. Vic-
toria had only 12. And, apart from the
London office, this bank has no branch out-
side that State. Add to the troubles over
wheat, the upset in the wool market and the
postponement of Australian sales, with the
consequent derangement of the exchange
business, and it isn’t marvellous that the
profits shrank. It is marvellous that they
shrank so little. The cheerful feature of
the case is that the drought wasn’t long
enough to destroy stock and thus affect the
productive power of the State. In fact,
after a year’s spell, the land should yield in
the coming year a bigger than average crop,
given only average conditions. Further,
while the chances thus favor an extraTgood
harvest, the State can look forward to the
. certainty of high prices.
For the present, however, many of the
bank’s customers must be nursed; and
because it adds a little to the assistance
which can be thus given, the bank has done
the proper thing in reducing the dividend.
A bank which regards it as more important
to maintain its lay-by than its dividend is
on the right track, and depositors and bor-
rowers alike are justified in putting a good
mark against this Bank of Victoria for its
present performance.
The balance-sheet figures compare with
those of 12 months ago like this: —
Dec., 1913. Dec., 1914.
Notes in circulation £9,611- £8,602 Dec. £1,009
Bills, etc. . . 461,229 351,359 Dec. 109,870

Premises, etc. . . 354,482 347,720 Dec. 6,762
Naturally the figures are not better than
they were a year ago. But there are no
changes of any serious consequence. The
deposits, taking the season and all other
things into account, have been very well
maintained; and though there has been a
shrinkage in liquid assets, that was inevit-
able on account of the necessity for carrying
customers through a bad time. It is far
better to see a movement that way. In
fact, any Victorian bank which has of late
been obliged to call in advances instead of
giving further help, had been guilty of pre-
vious gross mismanagement. There is a
limit, of course, to the further assistance
which any bank can safely give. In this
case the margin is not now very wide ; but
the improvement of the wool market will
help, and the Government’s action in ad-
vancing seed wheat, etc., will also consider-
ably relieve this and other banks.

For nearly 30 years the business had been
carried on by a proprietary co., in £lO
shares, with the late F. R. Godfrey as chair-
man. In the later years there were pref.
and ordinary shares. In 1909 it was decided
to let the public in, and split the £lO shares
into tens. The ordinaries (£6000) at
that time had the co. by the wool ;
hut they agreed to rank equally with
prefs. as to dividend, provided they
got £l2OO more in shares,- the whole
£7200 then counting as deferred shares. The
capital has remained at £22,930 pref. and
£7200 deferred till last year, when the prefs.
were made up to £30,000.. This followed on
an extension of the factory part of the busi-
ness to Sydney. The underwriting of the
new shares (£353) was a charge against
last year’s profits. Still, giving the year the
benefit of that, it wasn’t as satisfactory as
the two preceding years, which between
them carried the cost of establishing the
business in Sydney—something over £lOOO.
War and drought, of course.
Balance-sheet items compare this way :
1910. 1914. 1
Premises ... .. £4,604 £11,184
Plant .. .. 10,244 14,193
Stock . . . . 6,833 11,166
Book debts . . . . 6,029 8,056
So in four years £16,889 has been put into
those items, plus £2899 written off against
depreciation: and there have been a few
trifles in addition. New capital has supplied
£7070; liabilities have grown from £4148 to
£BBl4 = £4666. Add the two = £11,736. In
four years the business has thus provided
(besides the few trifles before mentioned)
an 8 p.c. dividend, what looks like a proper
reserve for replacement of plant and furni-
ture, expenses of opening a Sydney business,
and £5153 towards general assets. The
Bulletin can’t, of course, tell whether the
Co.’s future can be gauged by its very satis-
factory past; but at any rate there seems
to be no deterioration in the management,
and there shouldn’t be any permanent
shrinkage in the demand for the co.’s wares.

For the first time this co. publishes a year’s
accounts in the form laid down by the N. S.
Wales Act of 1912. In the old days the
prosperous gas cos. of the State stuffed
profits aw r ay; the Act gave them the right
to capitalise these reserves, both hidden and
visible. Since June, 1912, this co.’s changes
in capital have consequently been great:—
Capital as at 30/6/’l2 . . . . £195,000
Reserves capitalised . . .. 145,687
New capital paid lip .. .. 92,691
Present capital . . . . £433,378
The actually paid capital is now £287,691,
as against the former £195,000, and a 7 p.c.
dividend to-day is worth to the old
shareholders as much as 12J p.c. would have
been in 1912. In other words, until this
half-year they have lately got 121 p.c. on
their old capital and 7 p.c. on their new.
Even a 6 p.c. div. on the watered capital is
equal to a shade under 101 p.c. on the old
unwatered capital. Wherefore no condo-
lences are due to the co. on the apparent
reduction of the dividend.
Of the present capital (£433,378)
£378,000 is in “A” shares, which are
entitled to 10 p.c. when the co. can pay it.
Until then the co. may charge more than
. the 3s. 6d. standard rate for gas. The Act
was, in fact, too liberal to the cos.: it per-
mitted them not only to capitalise their
reserves, but also to charge enough for gas
to allow of their paying 10 p.c. on their old
capital, including the transferred reserves.
The result is that the people are now actually
paying more for gas than they were before
the Act was passed to protect them, and the
shareholders are drawing a bigger dividend.
In the art of making a mess of things the
N.S.W. Government is unapproachable.
For the first half of the year the co. paid
at the rate of 7 p.c.; for the second half, at
the rate of 6 p.c. The profit for the year
gave the 61 p.c. dividend and only £1633
over. But the Act still allows something
nice and handy to he put aside. To a
“special purposes fund’’ 2 p.c. may be
diverted ; and that isn’t 2 p.c. of the share
capital only, but of the share and loan
capital combined. This co. has borrowed
and spent £123,993. Add that to the share
capital = £557,371. From that 2 p.c. is
written off for depreciation. The profit
shown is therefore reduced by £11,532. This
sum is in addition to amounts actually spent
on repairs and renewals. Before the Act
was passed we knew this and other cos.
were stuffing profit away. They are doing
it still. The only difference is that now we
know the extent of the stuffing.

That’s a cheerful-looking thing, isn’t it?
The original flotation was a London idea,
and proved that if the English Company
law is sound in theory it is rotten in prac-
tice. Nothing, however, is to be gained by
going far into that part of the business.
Having taken an outrageous first bite out
of the Australian shareholders, who alone
put up any money worth mentioning, Eng-
lish sharks proceeded to do some more feast-
ing. Towards the end of 1911, feeling that
they were getting weak from loss of blood,
the Australian shareholders engaged Albert
B orchard to prepare a real balance-sheet.
On his report the shareholders’ committee
found on December 13, 1911, that the sharks
had fed to the following effect: —
Capital .. .. £54,651
Preliminary exes., underwriters’
commissions and various rake-offs
and London exes. .. .. .. £20,396
Loss on trading .. .. .. 3,177
23,573
Capital intact . . . . . . £31,073
That was less depreciation and after only a
few months’ trading. The management was
then shifted to Australia ; but it took a long
time, and what happened in the period to
May, 1913, can be only more or less guessed
at in the foregoing table. Since then the
co. hasn’t been losing blood quite so fast;
hut it is nevertheless clear that either the
management has been bad or there is nothing
in the taxi business —for a co. that has to
depend on hired drivers, anyway. Which
of the two it is this paper isn’t prepared to
say, though prima facie it does look as
though a Board consisting of one solicitor,
one barrister and one commercial man might
be improved upon. The best feature of the
case at present is that the co. is not at all
in debt, so that what assets it holds—mostly
motor-cars, duplicate parts and engineering
plant—are the shareholders’ own property.
But that isn’t much consolation to them if
the assets don’t earn anything except direc-
tors’ fees, salaries, general exes, and the like.
Some of these items at present are simply
awe-inspiring.

converted a profit of (say) £3OOO into a
loss of £1093. Before that the co. had had
a run of unusual luck, owing partly to good
seasons, partly to the great prosperity of
Broken Hill. This shows what the co. has
done after paying its dividend: —
Dec.,’o7. June,T4. Dec.,’l4.
Assets apart from tugs
and plant .. .. £26,496 £30,345 £21,610
Liabilities .. . . 2,217 913 956
Surplus .. .. £24,279 £29,432 £20,654
During the half-year £6255 has been sent to
England to help pay for the tug that Aus-
tralia wasn’t allowed to build. This,
together with the loss for the half-year and
the payment of a dividend, has had a dam-
aging effect on the appearance of the figures
for the six months. As for the current six
months, shareholders must be prepared for
a repetition of last half-year’s experience.
In fact, if the Broken Hill mines get back
to their old position in a couple of years,
they will be doing very well. And until they
do, this co. is going to be' more or less of a
sufferer.
The 8.11.P.’s blast furnaces at Newcastle
will begin to create a market for iron ore;
hitherto it has only been sold in small quan-
tities as a flux. In other countries vast for-
tunes have been .made out of iron mines;
and high-grade friable ore, low in phos-
phorus, will be very valuable in time, even in
Australia.
The recent run of good developments at
Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) should encourage
its small neighbor, Y Water Extended, to give
the show a fair trial. The co. holds 320
acres along the Graveyard line of lead. It
put down a shaft some two years ago to
130 ft., when the flow of water beat the small
plant it owned. Since then nothing has
been done, owing to the usual lack of funds.
The Graveyard is regarded by many as being
the main lead of the Emmaville district.
Good yields were obtained from its shallower
parts in the early days, but though several
old shafts were sunk to water-level, no ad-
equate provision was ever made to cope with
the flow of water. The geological features
and location of the area justify the expendi-
ture necessary to ascertain what is on the
bottom.
* * * *
After a long period of stagnation there is
a little activity in the Torrington (N.S.W.)
district. Plant is being erected at the
Butler’s tin mines, and preparations made
for a start. For various reasons, under-
stood to be apart from the prospects of the
mine itself, this low-grade show has been idle
for years. Hart’s, in the same locality, is also
doing a bit of work, and has some tributors
on average stone.
* * * *
The holders of the 60,000 shares of the
Southern Cross, Ardlethan (N.S.W.), have
no reason to feel gay. The 10-head battery
runs an odd shift occasionally whenever a
bit of outside ore can be obtained for a
crushing, and that’s the total. It has no
ore of its own available ; and the quantity
of ' custom ore available wouldn’t keep a
coffee mill going.
* *. * *
A certain amount of curiosity is permis-
sible regarding the possibilities of that pecu-
liar branch of mining in operation at Ballina
Beach, Richmond River (N.S.W.), to re-
cover tin, gold and rare minerals from the
beach sands. Success here should mean the
working of similar areas further south along
the coast. To the outsider difficulties appear
to be the quantity of black sand to be elimin-
ated, and the extreme fineness of the material
to be saved. The effect of storms, beneficial
or otherwise, is also a point to be considered.
Two more cases in which things haven’t
gone right since the public got in are re-
ported from the West. One is the Empress,
at Boogardie, which was going to pay divs.
almost from the jump ; the other is the Lady
Harriet, at Laverton. The Empress’s future
is menaced by an intrusive bar of diorite at
200 ft., and the Harriet has just announced
a poor return. Both shows were alleged
to have plenty of gold; and if results
approximate to those indicated by the pro-
moters’ assays cannot be shown, some inter-
ested person ought to ask why.
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) treated 161.000
tons in 1914 for £250.500, or 2100 tons
and £3OOO less than in 1913. Costs totalled
£173,859, leaving- a surplus over working
exes, of £76,654. Two Is. divs. were paid
during the first half of the year, but for the
remaining half shareholders had to be con-
tent with 6d. per quarter. The reason for
the drop is that an intrusion of unfavorable
rock has cut off values in two lodes at the
south end of the 17tli and 18th levels, and
there is a danger of the same bodies in the
deeper-levels being similarly affected. '
Someone is trying to coax the Westralian
Government to assist prospectors to inves-
tigate Yampi Sound and other parts of the
distant Ivimberleys. All kinds of metals are
alleged to exist there, and. according to tales
told in Perth, a few tickles with a pick
are all that is needed to expose great wealth.
So much loss has followed the backing of
shows in this wilderness that in all proba-
bility the reply given by the State will be
“nothing doing.”
+ * * -X-
Murchison is elated over a new gold dis-
covery in hitherto untried ground near the
Pinnacles. One party dollied about 150 oz.
from a small reef, and another party has
since obtained a bit by the same means. The
find is a few miles from the group of shows
recently optioned by Hans Irvine for the
Black Range, or some kindred Melbourne
crowd.
Perth creditors’ application to wind up
Chaffers has been further adjourned. Mean-
time efforts are being made by the Board
to carry on in' the interests of both creditors
and shareholders. But, really, the share-
holders haven’t a hope.
From Weston’s (W.A.) : Edna May’s
third level has been extended 200 ft. and looks
as well as, if not better than, the No. 2. Ore
reserves have been materially augmented
during the past two months by the width of
stone exposed at No. 8 level. At Edna May
Central an improvement in the mill returns
is expected shortly. Meanwhile ore of good
width is coming in from the Edna May, but
of what extent and value only development
can determine. Edna May Deeps is pushing
down its main shaft and hopes to get a
development shortly.
Golden Ridge (W.A.) is sampling the
Gladsome, which adjoins the Sand Queen,
at Comet Yale. The owners’ price is
£60,000, but they are said to be willing to
take most of this out of gold won.
* * * *
Oroya Links’ surplus over working exes,
for last year was £261,126. Six months ago
the co. had £1720 bullion reserve, now it has
none. The Oroya and Brown Hill sections
being practically worked out, the future of
the co. depends chiefly on the Eclipse and
Croesus Prop, leases, which according to
official reports have some fairly good shoots
at depth. There isn’t, however, much for
shareholders to build on.
* * * *
South Kalgurli made £lB6O in December,
which was the highest monthly profit for
the year. The ore now milled averages 245. 4d.,
and the co. hopes to maintain this for
some time to come. Except in one or two
places the bottom of the property still looks
sick. It is the leavings of the past that is
sustaining life and enabling occasional divs.
to be paid.
A hot and strong dividend duties and tax
on profits bill, with a year’s retrospective
clause, is being pushed through the West-
ralian Assembly by the Scaddan Govern-
ment. It will meet trouble on the doormat
leading to the Council.
Chairman Baring gave shareholders the
latest' at the Kalgurli meeting: “Our ore has
not decreased in grade during the past year,
and manager Black considers it will not do
so for another 12 months. Beyond that he
will not venture an opinion. The time is
probably not far distant, however, when we
will have to be content with a lower grade
and a consequent reduction in profit....As
a result of the war increases have and will
be made in the cost of stores essential to our
working. . . .After payment of the 4s. div. on
January 6 and income tax we shall have in
cash remittances through bankers (not yet
matured) and investments some £50,000.”
The comparatively early death knell of the
mine is sounded in another paragraph of the
manager’s report: “With all the evidence
now before us it seems in the highest degree
improbable that any profitable ore bodies
will be found at greater depth than we have
now reached.”
To the end of December Ivanhoe (W.A.)
had coaxed £7,983,807 worth of gold out of
3,065,486 tons of ore. That makes the
average value 525. Id. Down to the end of
1902, when rather less than a third of the
value had been won, the average was 91s.
There was a steady slide downwards from
that point until towards the end of last
year the grade was kept pretty steadily
below 325., as against 375. lOd. in 1913 and
395. Od. in 1912.
New Langi Logan, Ararat, after six
months’ training, with costs covered by
monthly levies of 4d. from each of the 100,000
shares, has made a second effort, and six
fathoms for Sfoz. is the tally. Six fathoms
out of a gutter 800 ft. wide is not of course
more than a drop from the ocean. In
these days of mining dullness it will
need . continuous weekly returns of 30dwt.
dirt, with the puddlers at work on a
fair scale, to inflate the market balloon to
its original size. Even Cathcart Central’s
rich dirt doesn’t bring in the buyer and let
out the stale bulls. Toole will therefore
have to hustle up dirt for his puddlers, if he
wants to make a showing. But what of-the
Cathcart gutter"? That is the second string
to the windy harp, but the tune is no good
yet. Meanwhile it is comforting to hear
that wash, 3ft. up from the bottom of the
Langi gutter, carries a good sample of gold.
Maughan, Tom English or Jonah Ward
would have revelled in a luxury of that sort;
so it shouldn’t be such a long way to Tip-
perary for Bill Toole, unless the statement is
all press puffery.
The old Lord Nelson Co. (Vic.) has a
mortgage of £B5OO to represent the price at
which the new co. got the mine and plant
under the monthly instalment system. Cash
in hand is £2660, but this includes £5OO
received on account of the mortgage. From
this it looks as if the co. would have
£10,660 to disburse as a liquidation dividend.
If the new co. can find payable stone in the
sink of 200 ft. now being carried out the
£BOOO is safe. If not there will be all the
risks that give life zest when dealing with a
no-liability mining co. Anyway, five direc-
tors announce that they are eligible for the
job of worrying over what to do if the
monthly payment isn’t forthcoming on the
due dates.
* * * _ *
Close work is clone by the Carlisle, Ben-
digo, even though it has to crush at other
folk’s batteries. Mining from 1200 ft. up
it does everything, including development, for
14s. Sd. per ton. Consequently, out of
64dwt. stone a neat profit is netted and a
trifle left for a modest reserve. The co.
handles about 10,000 tons every six months,
and has been on and off the dividend list
until £67.000 has been paid out. Work is in
a belt of spurry country, where, at 1140 ft.,
stopes go out 30ft. in width. Here the co.
has 800 ft. to go to the boundary, so there is
plenty of stone to play with, but the man-
ager won’t testify in a whole-souled way that
it is all payable. Still that is the custom
of Bendigo.
-V. * * *
Not many mines put up a better record
than Birthday Tunnel, Berringa (Vic.) :
its 379,000 tons have averaged a shade under
4dwt., yet £68,000 of profit lias been distri-
buted. As the gold was worth £310,000,
the co. has received 16s. sd. per ton; divi-
dends represent a fraction under 3s. 7d. per
ton, and costs under 13s. This last includes
development. Nowadays when things are
tight mine costs are down to 11s. 84d., made
up of mining and filling, 3s. 11.6 d. per ton ;
development, 3s. 6.7 d. per ton; crushing,
2s. 1.2 d. per ton; hauling 2s. Id. Office
charges have to be added; but seeing
that in over a decade the Board hasn’t swal-
lowed more than £26SO, apart from the fort-
nightly petty-casli item usual with all Bal-
larat cos., very little went that way. The
secret of the success of the Tunnel, despite
all the heaves of the reef, lies in the size of
the formation, the presence of free gold and
the fact that manager Hansen is a past-
master in the saving of pence. Hansen, by
the way, has been disappointed in a recent
hunt after a sweetener south at No. 5,
although the indicator is helping him a bit.
Now he will push ahead to pick up a fresh
shoot in the big block of Kangaroo ground
tacked on to the Tunnel leases a few years
back. With such low costs, there is always
a sporting chance in Tunnels.
Mount I.yell is looking round for ways
to use the surplus power from its new
hydro-electric scheme, and is being tried
with an amalgamation of the Hercules,
Primrose and Tasmanian Copper, which
last, like the others, is a deadly mixture of
zinc, iron, lead, etc. Negotiations are still
in progress.
* * * *
Whether the Lyell Blocks shaft is to fall
into the maw of the Mount Lyell Co. won’t
be known quite as soon as some folk thought.
Now that the shaft is below 1300 ft., driving
north is going on at that point. It has taken
a bit of time to get the first Bft. driven on
the road to the shoot. The management
confesses that the country is hard. When
that is said in the Mount Lyell region it
means only a shade easier than conglo-
merate ; and as the co. has butted into that
jaspery stuff at 1200 ft., where it is driving
south , the hunt for the North Lyell'shoots
is likely to last longer than the sanguine
section bargained for. Of course the Lyell
crowd still sticks to it that the Blocks is
only opening up a shaft for its use in the
future. The faithful in the Blocks, how-
ever, don’t lose their confidence because they
are told that the shoots change their under-
lie back into the North Lyell at about
1000 ft. A color of bornite in either of the
Blocks levels would set them in a frenzy of
optimism and lead to a sharp flutter in
shares. That’s why the adverse conglo-
merate south hasn’t knocked the market
into pulp.
* * * *
Mount Elliott (Q.) is patriotic. Two of
its directors, R. H. Henning (London) and
Comte de Venancourt (Paris), are going, or
have gone, to the front. More than that, the
Board applied for £lOO,OOO of the British
war loan. Henning is an ex-Australian. A
brother of his helped to frame the Common-
wealth Constitution.
* * * *
“Ganmor”: The new concentrating plant
at Mount Morgan did not commence opera-
tions until early in 1914. The costs for the
six months ended November, 1913. refer,
therefore, only to the old plant. The cost
per ton of copper produced has varied like
this :
Six months ended November, 3 913 .. £B4 6 2
Six months ended November, 1914 . . 93 7 10
Increase in cost per ton of. . . . £9 1 8
Refining and realisation charges are calcu-
lated on the same basis in both periods, but
depreciation is not included in either. Mount
Morgan has scrapned its old plant and spent
over £266,000 in building “the most up-to-
date plant in Australia.” The net result
so far is an increase in costs of £9-odd per
ton of copper nroduced. Admittedly costs
at November, 1913, were outrageous. Those
for November, 1914, are absurd.
* * * *
General-manager Ward, of B. 11. Block
10, is going up to Papua for six months to
test the Misima gold shows held under
option. His real job will be to make sure
that tliey are not too low-grade to pay.
Clark’s, of Charters Towers, recently
listed on Southern exchanges, will provide
another peg to hang a little gamble on.
The property is a consolidation of old leases
on the Moonstone. Treasure and Lady Maria
reefs, all of which raised some good stone
in the early days. Crushings have been
reported at long intervals; the small tonnage
raised during development has returned from
£lO to £2l per ton. Under present condi-
tions it takes a few weeks to raise 100 tons
of stone; but when Clark’s workings are
connected with the Lady Maria shaft, the
stopes over the 469 ft. level should produce
more quickly. Nevertheless, unless the
returns continue unusually rich, there are
likely to be calls. There are 180,000 shares.
Last year 18 mines at Charters Towers
crushed 61,153 tons for £224,667. an aver-
age of £3 13s. sd. per ton. The Brilliant
Extended crushed 19,075 tons for £53,665,
Mills United 7152 tons for £30.115, Brilliant
Deeps 9188 tons for £31.523, New Brilliant
Freehold 8752 tons for £24,272. During the
last, quarter several small mines reported
good crushings; for instance, the Victory
crushed 591 tons for £5974. Papuan (on the
Moonstone) 456 tons for £5432, and Clark’s
128 tons for £2535. Clark’s has 180,000
shares and the Papuan 96,000. They are
both very patchy, but are quite likely to
enliven the local market.
* * * *
Last year the Waihi (M.L.) crushed
183:405 tons for £329,775, which brings the
total value of gold produced to £10,772,682.
Of this lot shareholders have received
£4,681,387. Dividends have recently been
at the rate of Is. every three months. As
with most mines owning a glorious past,
the market value is high in proportion to the
present rate of dividend.
* * * *
Burma Silver-lead Mines, which the Bake
View crowd probably wish they had never
heard of. has issued another more or less
gaudy report. This time the year's work is
alleged to have “shown exceedingly favor-
able results” ; and an optimistic opinion of
a technical committee, comprising Gilman
Brown Ivuehn, Dr. Heberlein and the
younger Hoover, is appended. These _ ex-
perts talk in half and three-quarter millions
regarding the tonnages exposed in the vari-
ous workings. Something laudatory is said
about the large size of the lodes, indications
of their permanency at depth, and the high
values in the bottom workings. But similar
tales have been told before, and those who
believed them and clung on to the stock
found themselves compelled to either find
more cash or make way for debenture-
holders and other preference people, who in
turn may have to stand back for others
later on.

MADAME JEANNE BROLA IN ARDUOUS
OPERATIC ROLES.
THE BEAUTIFUL-VOICED SOPRANO WRITES AN
EXPERT MEDICAL OPINION.
It has been the surprise and delight of music-lovers
and theatre-goers to witness the lavish display of
vocal ability and operatic talent so unquestionably
possessed by Madame Jeanne Brola, the distinguished
soprano of the recent Quinlan Opera Company.
Many of her singing roles were prominently opposed
to each other, yet she was as much at home in
“Madame Butterfly” as in “La Boheme,” and as
much so in “The Girl of the Golden West” as in
“Aida.” It appeared natural to her in that what-
ever she did she did well.
Madame Brola during the 1913 season deservedly
became intensely popular with Australin music-
lovers, but she freely admitted that so great and
exhausting had been her duties that she would un-
doubtedly have suffered FROM A GREAT MENTAL
AND PHYSICAL BREAKDOWN were it not for the
fact that she took Clements Tonic, the ideal medi-
cine for the artiste and professional. Her tribute to
this splendid strength-giving and health-preserving
medicine has been often published for the public
good, and should be read by all professional and
commercial persons who at times suffer from brain-
fag, anaemia, physical fatigue or nerve weakness.
Ladies of society who suffer from nervousness,
caused by exacting social duties, and who suffer
from brain-fag or insomnia in consequence, should
use this medicine because it induces restful, sooth-
ing and invigorating sleep.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, February 1, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
Melba’s stay on the Johnsons’ station
(Frankfield), about three miles from Gun-
ning, finished up on January 31. The Voice
then caught the Melbourne express, which
had John Lemmone amongst its passengers,
and went off to Victoria to plunge into
more patriotic concerts. Flautist Lemmone,
whose musical ear is screwed into a hard
business head, looks after the details of the
Skylark’s efforts for Australian War Funds.
Concerning a statement which material-
ised in November that Melba had engaged
a suite of rooms at Manly, I have her autho-
rity to say there is no truth in it. She
hasn’t departed a hair-line from her inten-
tion to spend most of her time between
Coombe Cottage and concerts for the Cause.
But her plans may have to undergo revision
before long. She intended to leave for Eng-
land on March 17: but as the Unspeakable
will possibly be throwing his fez into the
Suez Canal about that time, our Chief
Soprano may have to either settle down or
take some other route back to Europe.
One member of the notable English family
which includes Commander Tyrwhitt—he
who has figured in two recent sea fights—
took up land in Queensland, with favorable
results. A daughter named Noel, who is
still enjoying the gleeful days of flapperhood
in Toowoomba, is an understudy of Uncle
Tyrwhitt so far as personal appearance
goes. Another relative, Walter, is a water-
color artist of some prominence. He had a
look at Bananaland some years ago, and
vented his impressions in a publication
called “The New Chum in the Queensland
Bush.”
The recent carnival on the shoulder of
Kosciusko brought forth some well-known
goffers. Nancy Parbury, the thin girl who
plays such a rattling good game, won the only
event she entered for,and got in three stunning
smacks that made the average golfing woman
sit up and take notice. Also J. A. Walsh,
a Brisbane man, made a sensational hit, by
driving a ball from the first tee a distance
of 255 yards. As this was an uphill smack,
the ball that rolled to its destination on the
first green made a record on the mountain
links. The fair and freckled Queenslander
helped to down the elusive argument that
the warm North is undermining the white
man’s physique. Bryan Holmes, the big
and burly Fiji sugar planter, who turns the
scale at about lost., played a game or two
on the same sward. Mr. and Mrs. G.
Andrews, also from Fiji, spent the holidays
on the mountain links.
Solicitor Rundle won the chief prize this
year at the carnival. This is the big silver
cup presented by president J. Baton, to be
competed for annually. Besides a lease of
the silverware, the winner received a per-
manent acknowledgment of liis might in a
pair of pipes. 11. Berkely, of the New-
castle Herald, won various events on the
mountain eyrie where the eagle builds its
nest. Tennis as an extra found Miss Kirk-
land and G. Andrews easy victors.
Thirroul, on the South Coast, is chiefly
remarkable for its surf and the variety of
surfers, plain and fancy, who patronise its
wave-banged shore in summer. As a side-
line it has an unusual taste in cottage
nomenclature, as thus: “Why Work.”
“Chirrup” and “You and Me.” There are
others, of course. Mrs. Maxwell and her
mother, Mrs. Walter Read, are putting in
the summer at one of the cots. The late
Walter Read was a well-known Rockhamp-
ton man who made a pile in business, and
unmade most of it by investing in station
property in Queensland.
Austinmere, an adjacent village, is shel-
tering numbers of up-country folks this
month, and a fine display of tanned calf
is said to promenade its sandy beaches o’
summer morns. Mrs. Charlie Badgery and
her daughters are in a roomy cottage which
overlooks the spray. Mrs. Charlie is auntie
to. Delfosse Badgery, the young N.S.W.
aviator who waltzed with the atmosphere
oyer Victoria Park the other afternoon in
his own home-made biplane. The squatting
Weedons are at the same address, and the
pretty wife of Dr. Martin, of Wagga, also
takes a dip in the surf thereabouts.
Mrs. Trefle, the widow of the late Minister
for Lands, is going to her brother’s home
in Tasmania for a change of scene. This
will be a few weeks hence, after she has
dried her eyes sufficiently to attend to the
business details that follow a funeral. When
you come to think of it, this habit of dying
is far too prevalent amongst our best people,
while our worst humans remain obstinately
tough and long-lived. Just this morning I
saw three well-known people who could
easily be soared.
Mrs. Leslie Wade, whose popular husband
passed out so suddenly last month, has been
hustled off to the country, She is a rather
frail, little lady, and her friends are trying
hard to repair the shock which she sustained
when the late Commissioner for Irrigation
flickered off the surface of things on the day
his friend J. L. Trefle was buried.
Mr. and Mrs. Jack Frith and family, of
Toowoomba, came back from England in
the Osterley. They had booked by the
Otway, but that much-engaged craft was
taken over by the Government for transport
work.
Cadet G. W. Muir, a nice Scotch boy who
went down on the Monmouth, was here on
the training-ship Mersey a while ago. So
was Middy Trounson, who was lost, with the
ill-fated Good Hope.
Anniversary Day Regatta, with the tem-
perature on the edge of 104 deg. in the saloon
of the flagship, was not wildly exciting till
the southerly burst up the harbor. Then
small sailing craft toppled over, and shriek-
ing canvas smacked the face of ruffled waters,
and rescuers hurried to submerged crews.
There were no casualties, for the Sydney
sailing man is an amphibious creature, and
as hard to drown as a crocodile. Governor
Strickland, whose steps were shadowed by
lie!]) d’Apice, came to town for the historic
event. The first great regatta was, of
course, not held in Sydney Harbor. It
was presided over by Noah, and, Judge
Backhouse not having been invented at that
time, there were no luncheon speeches.
The directors of the North Coast Steam-
ship Co. lent the Wollongbar, the usual deep-
sea mailboat being unavailable as flagship.
The managing director, genial Bob Bell, not
long back from Europe, took the head of the
flat timber substance on which the food
was laid out. He blushed profusely under a
healthy coat of tan at the exuberant helping
of melted butter the Minister for Education
poured over the North Coast Co. for handing
over the Wollongbar to the Regatta commit-
tee. His Ex. made a few brief remarks,
and then Judge Backhouse had his annual
opportunity to address the gathering as
chairman of the committee. The company,
greatly fortified by its refreshments, tore
itself away from the viands at 3 p.m., and
climbed upstairs in time to see the southerly
tumble the sailing man into the harbor.
Have you ever noticed that the" hotter the
day the warmer the lemonade the average
woman can' buy at such festivals as a re-
gatta? After hanging over the lounge rails
of the Wollongbar in the vain hope of catch-
ing pearls of wisdom from the speeches in
the saloon below, Woman panted along the
upper deck. Her object was to stalk some-
thing liquid with ice in the middle. But the
iced soft or hard drinks went to the male
visitor, and the inevitable warm gingerbeer
frothed over in the female hand. The con-
clusion that we really do belong to the
inferior sex is then gulped down in the silence
of despair.
William Pat Manning has resigned his
honorary billet as president of the Phil-
harmonic Society. In recognition of his
20-odd years’ connection with the Phil, he
was handed a large piece of plate in the form
of a loving-cup.
Actors’ Day, on February 6, at the White
City, threatens to break every previous
record. Ever since the war upset the only
universe we possess, the Australian mummer
has been putting in overtime at all manner
of patriotic shows. Yet no one is harder hit
than the footlight-ffivorite by Wilhelm’s mad
dash. The programme promises to extend
from Saturday till the middle of next week,
but the may cut it down under a new
code for the prevention of cruelty to scene-
shifters.
Rene Maxwell’s latest achievement is the
winning of the principal Scholarship of the
Guildhall School of Music. Landon Ronald
writes to Melba of his admiration for the
Sydney girl’s limpid soprano. Ronald, who
is chief of the Guildhall music centre, is
known here by his ballads, notably “Down
in the Forest.” This melodious lilt was prac-
tically introduced here by Melba. She is
about the only Australian soprano who can
give to the bird-like top note, at the end of the
sonsr, its true canary-tone. Rene, who went
to London last May, after a concert had put
£3OO in her purse, won the Royal Academy
Scholarship soon after her arrival in the Fog.
Now. as already hereinbefore mentioned, she
has snatched the coveted Guildhall prize in
open competition. This carries £SO per
annum for three years.
In moments of undue frivolity I have occa-
sionally told you, Arini. that pleasure ex-
cursions to the battlefields appeared to be
imminent. The incredible has happened.
Already personally-conducted tours are leav-
ing London and Bristol, and the tourist
packs up for the fringe of carnage as if he
were going to ’appy Margate for a week-end.
Some former South Australians, Mr. and
Mrs. G. 11. Atkins, are mentioned in a
“Joffre” (the irony of it!) touring party to
“Paris and the battlefields of France.” If
the trouble becomes more acute Kitchener
may be obliged to poll-tax travellers who get
in the way of the combatants. The tourists’
picnic hampers might also be seized in gross
for the starving Belgians.
The Osterley brought home a little coterie
of Bananaland folks, including Mrs. Alford
and her daughters, of Toowoomba.
Barrister Coffey is on the long trail home
via the United States. He left ’Frisco for
Sydney about January 19.
Hayley Lever, the Adelaide artist who
often exhibits here, is specially keen to fling
fleets of fishing boats on large areas of can-
vas. He is doing well in the U.S., and a big
picture, “Harbor, St. Ives, Cornwall,” is
going the rounds of art shows in Dollar-
land, and winning considerable applause.
A very tame and apparently law-abiding
collection of amateurs call themselves The
Vagabonds Club. In order to help the
Alexandra Hospital funds they produced
“The Profligate” at the Repertory Theatre
the other evening. The plas is rather dull,
in spite of its Family Herald atmosphere,
and the brawny young man, Jack Mackey,
who took the title role, looked like a promising
juvenile churchwarden. The other bad man in
the play, the older wicked boy of the piece,
rejoiced in the stage name of Lord Dangers.
But he, too, merely looked like a lord who
had fallen into reduced circumstances and
might reasonably be suspected of dishonor-
able intentions towards the nearest ham and
beef shop. Lotta Montgomery got more out of
her part as the country wench, Janet, than
did the rest of the company. The Vaga-
bonds Club might in future put its com-
bined efforts into a sparkling comedy with
much better results. The orchestra was
above the low-water mark usual at these
entertainments. Even the piano was more
or less in tune.
Gilbert Neill, the young man in charge of
the Tourist end of the N.S.W. Bureau, weds
Miss Mary Turtle, of Manly, before this
reaches you. Except for a quiet family
gathering the knot is to be without frills.
Ivy Shilling (the Teuton “c” has fallen
out of the dancer's name) is going to be
principal boj in the Birmingham panto, this
year.
Miss Frances Quirk, the Australian who
has been so much pushed along by para-
grapfiists’ nibs during her adventures in the
enemy’s country, was in Rome a few weeks
ago. There she was granted an audience
by Pope Benedict.
Australian artist Dora Meeson-Coates is
rounding up volunteers for the new female
police service in London.
Artist George Coates, formerly of this
continent, has put the last bit of color on a
portrait of the late Lord Northcote. The
subject is difficult from an artist’s point of
view, for the able Northcote had no fancy
beauty points or parlor tricks, and his most
flattered photos were distinctly ordinary.
Still, Coates has dressed his effort in all the
gauds of official millinery, and Lady North-
cote has approved of the result.
Mrs. Box, a sister of the only Melba,
passed this way the other day for a holiday
in Maoriland. Sister Nellie, by the way,
has definitely fixed up a tour in the U.S.
It starts in October, and will consist chiefly
of concerts, with a top-dressing of grand
opera.
Dr. Jim Woodburn. formerly connected
with St. Vincent’s Hospital, was in London
when the Great Shoot began. He intended
getting wider experience on the other side
before settling down in practice here. Now
he is busy at the interminable front, where
experience is mixed with gunpowder and
dreadful noises.
Dr. Woodburn, in a letter to a friend, re-
marks that the trenches in France are “no
fun” in midwinter. The only cheerful bit
of scenery he can see amidst the snow and
icy water is the countenance of T. Atkins.
According to Dr. Jim, the amazing British
Tommy is an incredible Mark Tapley who
hums snatches of “Tipperary” in a blizzard.
R. E. N. Twopeny, who used to be in
charge of the Pastoralists’ Review, is still
pursuing health in England. The last re-
port mentions that the Bath cure—which
presumably consists in swallowing mineral
water by the quart—was most efficacious.
Lieutenant Henry Talbot, of the 11th
Hussars, was reported missing some time ago.
Now he has the bad luck to be reported found,
wounded and a prisoner on German terri-
tory. It is about the worst kind of luck
the youthful ex-A.D.C. could have. The
enemy hasn’t earned a reputation for being
over-squeamish in caring for those who fall
into his hands on the sick list, whether they
be friend or foe.
Russian women who can afford to spare a
thought or two for fashion, are ordering fac-
similes of the fighting Cossacks’ uniform
coats. These are made in claret, green and
dove-color. The skirts are full and wide.
Even the cartridge pockets are faithfully imi-
tated. Mrs. Moscow adds a dagger and a
silver ear-ring. The large Cossack ring
hangs from one ear lobe.
A preliminary meeting, to decide what the
artists and art workers here can do for the
Cause, occurred in the R. A. Society’s
rooms. As the War office says it wants
more motor-lorries, a committee has been
formed to try to get one or two. The pic-
torial hat will go round at an early date.
C. .T. Dennis, who wrote an “Australaise”
for Tiie Bulletin, is being made the vic-
tim of theft wholesale. Sometimes the
larceny is acknowledged ; sometimes it isn’t.
If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
the writer who catches the public ear is the
most flattered and shamelessly robbed per-
son on earth. A legal friend tells me that
felonious entry into premises by day is
house-breaking, which is bad; but similar
entry by night is burglary, which is much
worse, because it is liable to wake the
baby. My idea is that the man who steals
another man’s poem by day should be sen-
tenced to 12 months in gaol, and the one
who reprints a poem after sunset without
acknowledgment and without remunerating
the poet should be slain with the jawbone
of a sub-editor.
Julius Knight, looking thinner than of
yore, and with a violent sneeze in his head,
loses none of his drawing power as regards
Sydney audiences. With a vapor-bath
atmosphere inside the Royal, and a thun-
derstorm grumbling outside, the theatre held
a most satisfactory amount of cash on Satur-
day night. It appears to be part of the
“Scarlet Pimpernel” plot that Julius and
Irene Browne should burst into song as the
play w T ears towards a climax. Of the two,
and in spite of a frog in his throat, Julius
is the lesser evil. Irene, who slogs heavily
at the attractive part of Lady Blakeney, has
a top note that gives the shivery sensation
noticed when a pencil scrapes a slate with a
high squeak. Lizette Parkes, the beauty of
the present Knight team, is the charming
Suzanne, whose waist is of the 19in., dis-
tractingly-slim species.
Granting the energy and enthusiasm the
average Sydney club dame is focussing on
socks and other items for the Red Cross-,
one cannot accuse these e'ood ladies of hiding
their light under a thimble. For instance,
the Women’s Club is shouting itself hoarse
in the friendly pages of the British Aus-
tralasian. After an impassioned declara-
tion of its prowess one club member re-
marks : “I venture to state, but without the
military authority of the Federal Govern-
ment” (there’s a drop of soothing syrup for
the censor in this), ’‘that our Sydney Red
Cross has done more than all the other
States.”
Paderewski has given up the notion of
combing out his wonderful yellow mane in
Australia this year. He was to have given
a concert-season hereabouts commencing in
March. He is even uncertain, writing from
Switzerland, whether he will complete his
unfinished U.S. tour. When, feeling he had
enough of the ’Murkan eagle, Paddy last
made tracks for Europe, he left 36 concert
appearances amonast the missing, and the
Eagle is feeling rather sore about it.
The London Bobby is said to sho.w no
signs of professional jealousy towards the
Policewomen, who have sprung up like mush-
rooms since the war. These volunteers are
clothed in a feminine edition of Robert’s
uniform. They have to drill, obey orders
fi;om a chief constable, and make them-
selves generally useful. The business of
guiding refugees, and looking after the
knickerbocker members of the huge antheap
keep these Robertesses busy on their beat.
This autumn we are likely to have a
blizzard of topical hats. Even in its woe
Paris is not quite indifferent to fashion so
long as its freaks are tagged on to a passing
event. The “General Joffre” hat, as adapted
by French milliners, is a saucy junior-Napo-
leon tricorne, with a fluff of ostrich feather
climbing over its peaked ridge. An “Eliza-
beth” hat, in honor of Belgium’s plucky
Queen, is a mixture of toque and Belgian
soldier’s cap. It is designed to shade one
eyebrow, and is not suitable for heat waves.
The “Alexandra” is a dashing imitation of
a British Guardsman’s high-crowned cap.
Women who have a tendency to run to
feathers can stick any kind of stiff plumage
straight up in front of this headgear, and
moult in windy weather in the highest pin-
nacle of style.
Yours affectionately.
VANDORIAN.
“Public Servant” : When the war started,
the long-promised N. S. Wales Superannua-
tion Bill was on the stocks, and the Service
felt the lump of disappointment come into its
throat once more. Great was the relief,
then, when it was made known that the Gov-
ernment regarded its promise to bring on the
Bill before Easter and pass it as sacred.
The news was circulated that Premier Hol-
man was emphatic on the point. The De-
partments thereupon arose as one battalion
and said, “Hoch der Holman!” But we
didn’t know. The other night Carmichael
introduced the measure into the Assembly
and explained that, while it would be passed
into law, the scheme would not operate until
gazetted, and that would not be before the
conclusion of the war! It’s a poor subter-
fuge, but Holman’s subterfuges were nevei
robust.

Melbourne, February 1, 1015.
My Dear Arini, —
Governor Stanley and Secretary Victor
Hood came down upon Middle Brighton last
week like wolves on a fold, and were back
at Macedon almost before the suburb knew
of the visitation. Their objective was the
Brighton Orphanage. It has been tending
motherless bairns for 01 years (Exon, lately
departed, was its guardian spirit for a big
slice of that time) and now it aspires to do
even better. Considering that it enjoys no
Government grant and is forced to depend
entirely on charity in consequence, it is
doing astonishingly well. A cooking school
has been added unto it; also four new class-
rooms. Sixteen girls will be daily initiated
into the mysteries of cooking, which will be
good for the girls and better for their coun-
try’s digestions.
President Dr. Wilson welcomed the visi-
tors, and the most glittering of them un-
loosed the usual flood of eloquence. It was
splendid to hear him tell of the small, dim
class-rooms in which he first started to learn
the wonderful things he can now talk about.
The small orphans cheered loudly, and
seemed proud to think that their governor
had been even more uncomfortable than
themselves in his youth. Then there was a
bit of Rule Britannia talk and more cheers,
after which the visitor fled, as described
above.
In the midst of war’s alarms Captain
Jackson, of the Coldstream Guards, has
plighted his troth to a younger daughter of
the Willie Pearson family, of Gippsland.
They trekked to Europe a while ago, and
ought to be back before this nibful of ink
is dry.
Frank Brown, who is closely related to
poet Louis Esspn and several other people
of talent and culture, and has done some
very fair work himself, has been arrested by
a charming stage lady, who proposes to keep
him in custody for the rest of his life. The
lady is Miss Edie (’aider, at present under-
studying Miss Minnie Love in the ’’Cinder-
ella” panto; but after the wedding, two or
three weeks hence, she and her captive are
to settle down in a place called Monea, near
Avenel. Frank Brown recently sold his
liberty for a mess of squattage in those
parts, and is growing mutton there.
Jennie Brenan is taking a brief holiday in
Sydney. She is staying with the Hugh ,1.
A ards at Potts Point—a menage where she
should hear plenty of “shop” talked. Hugh
J. was a champion dancer himself in his
early days.
Worth, the mightiest of all dress-designers,
has gone to the front, and so has his brother.
Also, the chief color-dreamer from Dreeolls
and Winter, whose little silkmark is a poem
inside a gown. Who would have thought
the drapery lords had so much fight in them?
Those British golf champions who haven’t
jone to the war have been playing a special
tournament for the benefit of the Belgian
Refugees’ Fund at Heaton Park, Manches-
ter. Michael Scott, who married an Austra-
lian girl, and golfed here for years and
years, was one of the combatants.
The A.W.N. Lea gue has been proudly ex-
hibiting its new ambulance in Collins-street.
It is spick and span and white, and has four
stretchers. Fevered by the purest form of
patriotism, the Wiinmen are now sending
round the bonnet for another.
The widow of “Weather” Ellery, first Gov-
ernment Astronomer in Victoria, died a few
days ago in Toorak.
Mrs. George Fairbairn and Mrs. Frank
Stuart are among the latest to donate travel-
ling kitchens to the military authorities.
I've given them three cheers apiece. Talking
of. these kitchen-contrivances, what is the
point of the long chimneys that tower above
them, shaking like a drunken man in an
ague, and offering a perfect mark for the
enemy’s artillery? Also, what is the object
of the sort of water-tank which splashes
scalding water over the roadway at every
step? If it was liable to fall on the German
one could understand. As it is, the con-
traption appears far likelier to boil our own
gallant defenders.
I held forth last week on the way Ameri-
cans love a princess. As a matter of fact, a
passion for any old royalty seems to be a
disease with them. Having no royal family
of their own, they create every other notable
a king or a prince or something similar.
There are Pork Emperors and Wheat Rajahs,
a King of Candies and a Prince of Harm
curers. And now the Republican papers
are featuring a “Suicidd Queen.” One could
become a duchess with very little trouble in
the U.S., I should think—for example, a
Drink Duchess.
Motorists Francis Birtles, Frank Hurley
and a bulldog have just done a 6000-miles
trip into North Australia from Sydney. The
Majestic Theatre has the film of the episode,
and there is a heap of incident and sensation
in it. The travellers are shown crossing the
Leichhardt, the Nicholson and the Cloncurry
rivers, and the trees on their banks are
beautiful to behold. There are artesian
bores of boiling water that make the Maori-
land geysers look silly, and long roads over
the plains, with good old bullockies winding
along. 40-strong, under the big trees. In
places the car swings through grass up to
the drivers’ chins. Elsewhere the tyres
knock over anthills as though they were
mere human beings. And yet these things
have sometimes taken 100 years in the build-
ing, and by comparison with one of them
the camp resembles a hat lying beside a
pyramid !
Pantomime producers could collect some
striking ballets from corroboree artists. In
one corrob. the natives glisten as if they
were in black silk tights, and each has a sort
of Hussar uniform painted on his gleaming
hide. The hair is mopped up high with
black and white wool, like a smart military
head-dress. The “painting” is done by
smeared blood daubed with fine feathers and
down. The “steps” are as light as a
Hielan’ mon’s prancing.
The blacks who fish in the Nicholson are
also a picturesque lot. They use large cir-
cular nets, on circus-hoop frames. They
wade down the stream in triangles, with head
arid shoulder above water, and the hoops
following. The fish leap with apprehen-
sion, or something, as the nigs pass. I don’t
know what they are, but they look like huge
salmon or Murray cod.
An alligator’s nest, with 60 eggs, suggests
a straw-stack. I daresay the business could
be carried on up North (as it is in some
parts of America) of having special breeding
places for the ’gators., and slaying the pro-
ducts for the sake of their ultimate purse-
and-Gladstone-suit-ease end. The- ’gators
are handled quite easily when they are
babies, and go two or three on a man’s hand.
Later they grow to weigh a couple of tons,
but as they take about 300 years to do it,
the business of cultivating them is obvi-
ously not one that gives any hope of “quick
returns.”
Camels are in the picture, too. They
would look like haughty Lady Yere-de-Veres,
so supercilious are their noses, were it not
for their feet, which resemble frying-pans.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Fred Youngs left for London and the Agent-
General’s Office on the Mooltan after a series of
dinner engagements. The oratorical bombardment at
some of them was- terrific. ; Their small son went
with father and mother. Miss Hilda . Cornish was a
passenger by the same boat; she is travelling with
the Walter Duffields.
E. H. Wainwright, who is with a battalion of the
Ilo.val Fusiliers, was on Christmas leave at Hartle-
pool at the time of the raid. He had a fine view of
the proceedings. He saw 50 houses on the “Front”
wrecked, and noted that some of the unexploded
shells had a diameter of 9in., and bore stamps of
2000 and 7000 metres. The .Tack Mouldens, who also
came in for it, have been living at Seaton Oarew,
nearby, for some time, and though their house Was
untouched, shells were whizzing overhead and landing
in the fields about them. It is said that the German
ships lay close in all night, and signalled in the
British code to the battery at the mouth of the
Tees' asking for the whereabouts of the rest of the
fleet. When the information was trustingly supplied
they waded in with light hearts and a feeling of
security.
The Sturt statue may cost, a bit more than was
expected originally. So a London committee lias
been formed, consisting of thy Agent-General, Mr.
J. B. Whiting and ! -'Myss; Sturt? ‘to look for a few
pounds. Also, Mr. Simpshn Newland and Josiah
Symon, K.C., have been added to the local committee.
The old well in the basement of the Prince Alfred
Hotel —one o'f the original sources of Adelaide's water
supply—is to be used in connection with the building
of the Town Hall. Adelaide is perforated with old
wells. They are only discovered, as a rule, when the
boarding over them gives way and astounded citizens
fall in.
The foundation-stone of the new building for the
Institution for the Blind was laid by president
Charles Goode on Saturday afternoon. The land
site faces the North Adelaide Children's Hospital.
Inspector George Orr died on Sunday, aged 66. He
came to S. Australia as a boy of 19, and, joining the
mounted police, saw much exciting service in the Far
North.
A little more war news from London :
Captain Blank has been staying here during his
four days’ leave. He says that many society women
are at the front solely for the purpose of showing off
their clothes, and naturally the men wish them to
the D —. The women also go down to the steamers
to see if they can catch a nice invalid. The sick and
wounded invariably prefer to go where men will
attend to them.
After that compliment to our sex, Yarrie,
let’s make up our minds to stay at home.
It was my ambition to powder my nose
coolly in the firing; line w T hen a press photo-
grapher was bandy, just to show the Ger-
mans what the Girls of the Bulldog Breed
think of them ; but I haven’t got the heart
now to go and be some sort of a ministering
angel. What’s the use when you know you’ll
c.nly be regarded as a maddening devil?"
How the war has changed things, my
dear! I read the other day that our own
Marshall Hall had brought back some good
news of clever Florence Hood, said good news
being that she had escaped from Prague.
“Escaped !” My brain whirrs like a clock-
work toy when I read about aspiring young
musicians “escaping” from any such place,
and remember the frantic exertions we had
to make to hoist them there.
In Benson’s Dramatic Co., which was play-
ing “The Merry Wives” in London at
Christmas time, the evergreen Mrs. G. B. W.
Lewis was going strong as Dame Quickly.
Rupert Conrick, one of the promising young
men of the same co., is another matter of
Melbourne interest, for Rupert was a star
Pupil at South Yarra school of histrionics
run by Josephine Saiiiuell, who got most of
her training from Mrs. Lewis long ago. So
the indefatigable Josephine now has her old
tutor and her young pupil acting under
Benson’s management. Oscar Asche, by
the way, w T as a Melbourne schoolboy before
lie went abroad and became a Bensonian
actor, and Cyril Keightley and others who
fished for tittlebats in the Yarra have be-
come associated with Shakspearian drama
in England. The sacred lamp of the “legi-
timate” is fed with a lot of Melbourne oil.
Many friends and admirers of Harrie
Ireland, who have lost sight of the auburn-
haired actress for two or three years, will
be glad to hear that Dr. McKenzie’s inter-
esting surgical theories re Harrie’s lameness
promise to be triumphantly verified. The
doc. diagnosed bone displacements and adhe-
sions and things, instead of rheumatism, and
under his treatment the patient lady sub-
mitted to more agonies than she ever
endured as a suffering heroine in Bland
Holt’s theatre of operations. For about 20
weeks she lay helpless on boards as hard as
those she used to walk upon. Now she is
able to get about the house on crutches
without assistance, and Dr. McKenzie pre-
dicts that she will presently waltz back to
stage life with renewed grace and vigor.
Apart from its surgical character, the treat-
ment has given Harrie Ireland a thorough
rest-cure.
Keith, son-nf-the Edward Carliles, who
went to the war as lieutenant in the Vie.
“Tropical” force, has a brother. Hildred, who
went with the Army Medical Corps. Sister
Maud is a staff nurse with the same lot, so
the Garble family is well represented in the
Great Disturbance.
The law case that everybody has been
waiting for comes due this week or next; but
the leading lady has broken her engagement
and left for a foreign land. So her glad
rags will not be seen in court. The other
lady, however, is prepared to come along with
her plain, unvarnished tale, and proceedings
should be of social interest. The case has
at least one side-issue which some people
would go miles to hear about —for there is
always a fear of the special bits being kept
out of the newspapers.
My statement that one of the bright Gil-
lespie girls of Mentone had just been married
in Colombo was much too previous. Miss
Alma Gillespie has sent word of her engage-
ment to a Mr. Maurer, whose address, when
lie is at home, is Calcutta. But the marriage
is mentioned only as an event likely to
happen very soon.
The Norman Brookes pair gave a grisly
account of their pleasure-trip to Flanders,
where they inspected the acres of death and
desolation. Nobody would have been sur-
prised if Norman had welded his racket into
a gun, as Anthony Wilding and many other
sports have done. Perhaps the sight of a
battlefield put him off the notion. In any
case, his health is too poor.
Beatrice Day. who used to collect for the
Red Cross outside theatres on “first nights,”
has now got a fresh patriotic notion. She
attends. picture-shows and such-like places
and recites at young men in order to make
them enlist. The young men, who have in
many cases taken their girls to the enter-
tainment expressly to avoid being sung and
recited at, simply bate it. But everyone
else approves, including the managements,
and the Empire is understood to be delighted.
Major George Raleigh, of Victoria, was
killed last week at the front while aviating.
He had been mentioned in despatches only
a week or so before his fatal flight. The
Ernest Raleighs are relatives.
Fred Sargood, eldest son of our lamented
Frederick Softgoods, belongs to Sydney
nowadays. But we are interested in him
still. Hordes of relatives trekked over from
here, accordingly, for the wedding of
daughter Nancy with John Antill Pockley.
John is a son of the doctor and a
brother of the boy who was killed in Papua
at the beginning of the war. The Antill part
of the family, have been mixed up in mili-
tary matters in Sydney since the earliest
days. There has mostly been a colonel or
two in evidence, and an Antill girl married
Colonel Lassetter, and tlieir son was wounded
in France the other day, and is now on his
way to Australia to recuperate. So you see
they are essentially the sort that fear no
foe in shining armor.
So Geoff Kiddle, of Walbundrie, is to
marry Auntie Phipps, after all. I used to
tell you so about once a month when the
Fullers were here, but I was always con-
tradicted. He is a large, aquiline-featured
young man with a gift for polo, 'and of
course you know what she is like. He was
in India when the war began, and left with
the first Expeditionary Force from there.
Since then he has been mentioned in
despatches. He got engaged during one of
the five-day trips to England which the
War Office allows the fighters to make.
Vanda Clarke, the tall, slim Mount
Schank Clarke girl, has been operated on
for appendicitis at Dr. Shields’ hospital in
Park Lane. Her mother is by her side, and
all was going well when the last bulletins
were posted.
The Hammersley girl, who, as I told you
two weeks ago, Jias become engaged to young
Rupert Ryan, is a sort of a cousin to Big-
john Forrest’s lady. The latter was a
Hammersley before she married.
Clive Baillieu is to be married to Miss
Rubv Clark on February 21 at St. John’s,
Toorak.
v ie . le trouble in a block of flats which
•shall be nameless. One tenant returned to
hei luxurious rooms after the theatre to
find them flooded with water, the carnets
ruined, the expensive wallpaper a S
smudge, and the pet. Persian cat insane from
dampness Detectives were summoned.
" ith relentless logic they deduced
presently-going on the evidence that a
stream of water was pouring through the
root—that the damage was the fault of the
flat above. Investigation proved that they
had not erred. The owner of the flat
above was away week-ending. Girl-like, she
had left the faucet of her liand-basin trick-
ling during an under-pressure of water.
The faucet turned to a torrent as soon as
suburbanites bad finished watering their
gardens and bathing the children. Hence
the devastation. Mrs. Flat-above re-
turned, rectified the slight damage done to
her tile-lined bathroom, and sent down an
airy message to say she was “sorry.”
“Sorry!” wailed the victim of her casual-
ness. “What’s the good of that! Who is
going to pay for the damage f” It is this
question which will have to be settled ulti-
mately, I fear, with the help of Costs.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

WARNING TO DYSPEPTICS.
Many interesting paragraphs have recently
appeared in the press concerning the remark-
able antacid properties possessed by Bisn-
rated Magnesia, and thousands of people
now regularly take half a teaspoonful of the
preparation in a little water after their
meals as a safeguard against indigestion,
dyspepsia, heartburn, flatulence, etc. It
appears, however, that in several instances
other forms of magnesia, bearing somewhat
similar names, have been used, often with
very unpleasant results. To guard against
dangerous substitution and to ensure getting
the genuine produce as recommended by
physicians, readers should ask their chemist
distinctly for pure Bisurated Magnesia, and
insist oii being supplied in buttles having the
full name —Bisurated Magnesia —blown in
the glass.*

A Simple Recipe for Clearing
the Complexion.
Exposure to hot winds and sun makes the
nerves and muscles of the face tired and life-
less, and the skin shrivelled, wrinkled and
unhealthy.
If anyone with a sallow, blotchy, wrinkled
or pimply complexion will only take'a little
(rouble in following the directions here given
they will find a marvellous improvement in
their complexion. Get some Puritol Wax
from the chemist or draper, and apply at
night, washing off in the morning with warm
water and soap. Then lap a little cold
water 10 times upon the face with the hands,
allowing it to get thoroughly round the
closed eyes. The treatment should be fol-
lowed out in every detail to ensure success,
and undoubtedly accounts for many of the
clear complexions so much admired by those
who do not yet know the secret. See that
you get the right kind, it will not injure the
most delicate complexion.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
No one can say that fortune is treating
Premier Holman badly-—if only there was
any kind of fortune that would keep that
unlucky person out of the pawnbrokery. So
far, seven months of the financial year have
ambled past, and the N.S.W. revenue is
£283,873 more than for the corresponding
period of 12 months ago. In the circum-
stances. Holman—who has no war on hand
but thinks he has —seems a great deal more
sorry for himself and his difficulties than the
case calls for.
A DIFFERENCE.
GRAN: "Wot! In swiminin' eigen?"
THE BOY (gloomily): “ Swimmin' be blowed!
It ain’t near big enough. Just soakin."
Colonel Holmes, the officer who sent the
captured German flag to Sydney’s Gaud
Mayor, and who has lately been explaining
the terms of Papuan surrender to a large
flock of critics, was good enough to throw in
some remarks about the conquered territory
—or the explored fringe of it. In the opinion
of the Colonel, it isn’t fit for occupation by
white people. No place freshly come to
ever was fit for white people. The first
conquering Colonel Holmes who arrived at
London said it was a foggy marsh. The
first Holmes who came to Sydney said it was
an inhospitable wilderness. And the first
of the same military breed to invade Vic-
toria abandoned Port Phillip because it w r as
too hopeless a place even for a gaol.
The Yankee agents who descended on
Australia in the hope of grabbing oil coun-
try in Papua and were promptly turned
down by the Commonwealth Government
are finding the Peake crowd in S. Aus. much
easier prey. Around Kingston in particular
hundreds of square miles of territory' have
been taken up on search licenses by people
who are not searching worth tuppence, but
who in some cases are actually negotiating
for the sale of their untouched areas for as
much as £BO,OOO. Of course it is only to
U.S. oil grabbers that money like that is
talked. The next six months will show
whether there is an oilfield in Australia,
li' there is one it will be the. Common-
wealth's misfortune that it will be controlled
by the most thoroughly inefficient Mines
Department in Australia. That is, it will
lie controlled so far as the Department
hasn’t allowed control to pass quite out of
its hands.
A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.
The wife of the Minister for Defence (Senator
Pearce) laid the heelplate of the torpedo-destroyer
Swan at the Commonwealth dockyard, Cockatoo
Island The Minister said: “The laying of this keel
is another rivet in the coffin of the German navy.
News item.
THE MINISTE FOR DEFENCE: “ Bog in,
boys, and get his coffin ready as soon as
possible, or rest assured he’ll be conducting
OUR funeral.”
TRADE UNIONIST: “ That's all right boss, but
what are yer payin' for overtime?”
The most beautiful argument yet advanced
against Protection is submitted by Pollen
Bishop, an English water-color painter of
good standing, who lately settled near
Adelaide and is getting good commissions.
A section of the public is asking for a
removal of the present 25 per cent, duty on
works of art other than those coming direct
to a public Art Gallery. To the discussion
Bishop contributes this: —
The tax was imposed as an experiment, and it has
now been in force upwards of three years. Up to
two years ago I was an English artist, sending only
a certain proportion of my output to Australia. This
duty practically killed my export business, and the
only way of meeting it was to come out myselt and
work inside the tariff wall. Therefore I now com-
pete more strongly than before with the local artists,
and 1 believe other English painters are thinking
of following my example.
Australia, wanting population, puts on a
Protective duty; and when the duty does its
work and brings the population, Follen
Bishop asks us to stand off and observe the
failure ! Still, humorous as he is, you can t
refuse a hearing to a painter who talks of
“my export business” and is content to call
his immortal works an “output,” just as if
they were crates of cheese. ;~
Victoria’s closer-settlement policy is being
turned over by a commission, which is learn-
ing the old lesson that Government repur-
chase is a dangerous medicine to give the
patient. Members and ex-members of the
Lands Purchase Board say that again and
again country which had been for sale for
(say) £5 was promptly withdrawn when the
Government looked that way, and couldn't,
afterwards be got for less than, (say) £6 10s,
In some cases a deal was made —sometimes
for no better reason than that the .Minister
told the Board to go ahead —and then of
course the price of similar land in the same
district was puffed up to :£G 10s. also. The
existence of a buyer with plenty of borrowed
money to play with, and rotten ideas of values,
proved in Victoria, as everywhere else, a
curse to the private buyer, and a magnificent
thing for the land-jobber and the boodling
syndicate.
It is the business of a High Commissioner
to advertise; but Mackenzie, of MX., over-
did the drum-banging when he wrote to
Churchill, after the smashing of the Blucher
by Beatty’s battle-cruisers —“The gift of
New Zealand’s ship was a most far-seeing
act of statesmanship.’’ What the Maori-
landers themselves would have thought about
it if their remote and vulnerable islands had
been bombarded by raiding Germans is
another matter; and that the raiders didn’t
actually arrive was solely due to their
dread, not of the distant New Zealand, but
of the lingering Australia. Some varieties
of “far-seeing statesmanship” need a plain
business-like lifebelt to keep them from
foundering. It was Maoriland’s good luck
that Australia was able to supply the life-
belt.
Italy is preparing to abandon its neutra-
lity, and to “strike for ils own hand.” So
says Oceania, the organ of the Italians in
Australia. The stroke is to be delivered,
according to the same journal, in April, and
against Austria; and it adds that Italy
already has 1,250,000 men under arms. The
information to this effect comes from “the
very highest sources, which admit of no
possible doubt as to the accuracy of the in-
telligence.” Italy will demand the “lost,
provinces” which have always been claimed
by the Irredentists; and it will probably also
demand such possession of Yalona as the
British now claim of Egypt. The lone-hand
game will leave it free to make peace with-
out consulting any of the Allies, and even to
avoid war at all should Austria obligingly
yield without a fight; but this latter is not
probable. Austria has never forgotten Ous-
tozza and Lissa.
This strange announcement was found
last Thursday on the business paper of
N.S.W. Assembly :
Mv. Holman to move: “That, in view of the unpre-
cedented character of the financial situation, this
House is of opinion that the Government should he
prepared to enter into contracts with firms of
approved standing willing to undertake reproductive
works upon the system outlined in the agreement pro-
• posed to be entered into with Messrs, Norton Grif-
fiths, as laid upon the table on August 20, 1913,
and submitted to this House on October 2, 1913.
Now Holman’s revenue was still going
strong when last heard of, and he had no
war charges to meet, and the British and
Australian Governments were still finding
him loan money—also, in any case, he is
alleged to be an anti-loan Premier. So will
this slim and plausible cove say what is the
“unprecedented character of the financial
situation?” And will he state what he
thinks of State Enterprise, as he conducts
it, if it is to be a mere fair weather device,
and his Government has to take refuge in
the wude and hairy bosom of the Private
Capitalist as soon as a cloud appears on
the horizon?
THE RIGHT MAN GETS THE JOB
TOR ONCE.
It has been arranged that Alfred Deakin shall go
to the Panama Exhibition after all. — Item.
The Law seems to think that, if the
criminaleopard can’t change his spots, the
next best, thing is to force him to change
from one spot to the other. The other day,
in Adelaide, a mean type of confidence
trickster who had tried to operate on two
workless immigrants was “ordered two
months’ imprisonment, the warrant to be
held over for two days in order to give
accused a chance to leave the State.” This
was, in effect, a hint to hurry across the
Victorian border. It may not have been
within the powers of the South Aus. court
to order him right off the earth; but the
kicking of an undesirable from the State
where he is known to the State where he
isn’t known seems a foolish way of dodging
a responsibility and piling it on a decent
neighbor.
The trumping of poor old Joe Cook’s
“patriotic” trick was a droll episode in the
game of party politics. Joe expected to
make a point with his sudden outcry for
100,000 men. But Pearce got on a camp-
stool and shouted ditto. Then Hughes
screamed an eloquent statement of "the
Empire’s Need, and, before turning off his
How of eloquence, added: “I have noted
Mr. Cook’s remarks concerning the Govern-
ment’s war policy. He is standing firmly
behind the Government. This is most, satis-
factory.” Joe’s trick was trumped. He had
hoped to take up a position in front of the
Government, and found himself standing
firmly behind it.
THE DISCARDED SURF-BOARD.
“H’m!” said Mr James insinuatingly, “I think
the principal plank in the platform upon which you
were elected was a non-borrowing plank.” It was a
genuine bull’s-eye. Mr. Griffith was silent, and
nobody said him nay when Mr. James quietly ob-
served that he did not think people often took these
planks seriously.”— N.S.W. Parliamentary news.

In a patient and persevering way '
The scholars were grounded at Boobook school.
They learned pot-hookery every day,
Arithmetic and the Golden Hole,
The alphabet and the reason why
All beetles walk before they fly.
The teacher crammed them as best she could,
And mustered them daily The Flag to cheei !
But never once told them that nationhood
Is founded on factories built Out Here,
While the Union Jack that is German made
Is flown to the glory of German trade.
When there was need for it, now and again,
She walloped the boys with a German strap.
And little she recked of Australia wber.
She showed them the world on a German map,
Or, exhorting the class with an earnest air,
She rested the while on an Austrian chair.

She showed Little Willie, the stupid and slow

Exactly how ’leven-times ought to g 0....

WHICH?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Smith owned a little back-blocks run,
A wife and pair of kids ;
He took no stock in Empire Days,
He made no yearly bids
For cheap applause by waving flags
And boasting of the shame
And anguish he would bring on those
Who sneered at England’s name.
Smythe was a Liberal of means.
He classed such folks as Smith
Among- the Empire’s Menaces.
He catalogued them with
The scoundrels who support Home Rule,
And strive for higher pay,
And burgle people’s homes by night,
And wreck their peace by day.
To Smythe, Smith was Disloyalty
Expressed in human form ;
A grasping, ill-conditioned dog,
A skulker and a worm.
Also, a waster to the core
In sentiment and deed,
On whom no country could rely
In time of stress or need.
War came, and Smith went to the front.
He left his home and wife.
He gave the Empire all he had —
His youth, his health, his life.
Smythe sent a Fund a thousand pounds
(It might have well been four),
And went on living as he had
For years and years before.
The press proclaimed that Smythe had played
A truly noble part.
Smith fell, unadvertised, abroad,
A bullet in his heart.
Which was the better patriot,
As men are judged by men,
The citizen who swung his sword ?
Or he who swung his pen?

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Weights for the Oakleigh Tlate (due on
the 13tli at Caulfield) and the subsequent Newmarket
Handicap and Australian Cup were published last
week. Judging from the principal discrepancies in
the estimates of the V.A.T.C. and 1 .R.C. handicap-
pers, one would sap that Flash ol Steel, at /st. 210.,
is the best-treated sprinter in the Newmarket, tor
the same gee got Bst. 31b. in the Oakleigh. dhe
scale of weights for the shorter flutter is about 61b.
higher on the average. Woorak, for instance, gets
This is said to be a “crushing” burden for a 3-year-
oiu to hum,) down the Newmarket course, but AYoorak
is the -popular fancy, nevertheless. Land of Song,
the imported nag with good British credentials, got
9st. and 9st. 31b. for the big events at Flemington,
which seems to explain his trainers announcement
that the Irish Derby winner will be kept to w.t'.a
races. All the same, there is no visible reason why
Land of Song shouldn’t have a go for the Newmarket,
anyhow, if lie is the flier - he is said to. be. Tn thd
Australian Cup the mucli-talked-about Sir Solo, from
Maoriland, is on the Bst. 51b. mark, along with St.
Spasa and Audacity. Sir Solo has done nothing
since he came to Melbourne to justify his notoriety.
At Flemington in November, and again on New
Year’s Day, the aged horse was carefully advertised
as a “cert” by tricky speculators who appear to
have started a tipping agency with ulterior motives.
The horse ran badly each time. Still, the winkers
and whisperers are glorifying his name, and the
looks quote the oft-defeated animal at a short price
for the Australian Cup.
The tipping agency aforesaid was at work last
week-end in the interests of De Gama, the brilliant
Maorilander, which won tln-ee bai d’""n° d-rD''* - c~e
Melbourne Cup meeting, and was otherwise remark-
able for having its nomination refused, ‘\vitho.,l c .-
planation,” by the stewards of another racing club.
De Gama was entered for a petty race at Sandowrr
Park —so petty that it was not generally thought of
as a likely journey for the great horse. Moreover,
one of the" nag’s most notorious backers was tipping
Maltravers as a cert for the same race, and the
newspaper prophets followed suit.. Consequently'
Maltravers was always first favorite in the betting,
whilst De Gama’s price fluctuated exceedingly, as
the result of the market operations of its notorious
friend. But De Gama won on the post, whilst the
cert. Maltravers was nowhere.
“Snaffle”: Sol Green retires from book-
making and will give more attention to his stud
estate, Shinlev. in the Warrnambool (Vic.) district.
Of course, breeding is consistent with ownership, and,
maybe, Sol will be more heard of in that line.
Thus Shipley may become historic, like de
Mestre’s Terrara, Tail’s Bvron Lodge, Fisher’s Mari-
bymong and Wilson’s St. Albans. For bookmakers to
own horses has always been regarded as suspicious.
Yet Australian records that way, in the higher ranks,
have been clean. Joe Thompson (Solomon) had a
genuine love of racing. The horse was not a mere
gambling machine to him when he owned a good
nag. He was in partnership with Jimmy Wilson, of
St. Albans. They experimented with smart coups,
but always legitimate, according to turf ethics.
Their biggest attemot was a quadruple—Darkie for
two steeples and Flying Scud for twe flats. Three
legs of this came off; the fourth failed. Flying
Scud was an amazing pony. Tkev got him in for
two big-horse handicaps at sst. 101 b., allowable then.
Joe made no secret of wbat he thought of Don
Juan in 1873. In a sportsmanlike spirit he said to
all bands: “This horse must win the Cup,” and he
took a party of quidnuncs down to St. Albans to
see the prodigy. The general verdict was: “A
feather-legged carthorse.” But “Augur” Chapman
put in a saving clause: “They run in all shapes.”
Of the army of players who have taken
part in inter-State cricket matches between N.S.W.,
Vic. and S.A., only 16 have piled up 2000 runs. Of
these, four have taken part in this year’s contests—
Bardsley (N.S.W.), Armstrong, Hansford (Vic.), and
Mayne (S.A.). The other 12 are Noble, Duff,
Trumper, Gregory, Iredale (N.S.W.). McAlister, Gra-
ham, Laver (Vie.), Hill, Gehrs, Giffeu and Reed-
man (S.A.). Clem Hill, with 6169 runs, has the
best aggregate, and Noble, with 68, has the best
average.

“Sr”: Westralia is not the only State
that lias an acquaintance with rung-in prads. There
is Tassy, for instance. Recently a bob-tailed animal
called Tnrpinite won a trial race at a T.R.C. meet;
but some busvbodv looked at liis mouth, which was
wide open as'lie finished, and reckoned that, instead
of being a three-vear-old, as the nomination claimed,
he was”an old prad of five autumns. It is reported
that the crowd who worked the fake stood to win
£4000; but vulgar inquisitiveness as to the nag s
bona fides alarmed the books, and no pay-out was
made. Turpinite was duly disqualified, but the story
is not yet at its last chapter. Still, the ringing-in
is done, mostly at the trots. About a dozen trotters
who have scored in the Island* during the last two
years were swindles.
Australasian stallions whose progeny
scored one win or more on the English turf last year
were: Clean Sweep (Zalinski—Benzine), one winner,
three wins, + 300; The Victory, (The Admiral—The
Charmer), two winners, two wins, £224 ; Parthian
(Grand Flaneur —Archeress), one winner, two wins,
£200; Carbine (Musket —Mersey), who had done no
stud duty for some seasons prior to his death aged
28, one winner, one win, £167 ; Australian Stai
(The Australian Peer —Colors), one winner, one
win, £142; Fftz-Grafton (Grafton— Olive Branch),
one winner, one win, £117 ; Stoceado (Cranbrook -
Tiwoona), one winner, one win, £63. More im-
pressive is the list of successes in the Cold Country
during 1914 of the progeny of sons of Carbine and
of Trenton. Spearmint (Carbine —Maid of the
Mint) had 11 winners of 24 races, worth £16,532;
Wargrave (Carbine —Warble), three winners, seven
wins, £3447 ; Fowling Piece (Carbine —Galinne),
five winners, nine wins, £2260 ; Bomba (Carbine
St Neophyte), one winner, one win, £100 ; Caradoc
(Carbine—Warrior Queen), one winner, one win,
£36; Torpoint (Trenton —Doncaster Beauty), four
winners, seven wins, £2432; Cornstalk (Irenton
Glare), three winners, four wins, £606 ; Kano
(Trenton —Rabia), one winner, one win, £186;
Foundling (Trenton— Lady Charity), one winner, one
win, £100. Wargrave, whose progeny were doing so
well for Carbine, is dead.
Sam Rainsbury, formerly well known in
racing circles, has weighed in. He w r as at one time
a prominent member of the Victorian Club, and con-
sidered to be well in, but died poor. Rainsbuiy
acted as commissioner for Robertson Bros, when
their horse Coronet won the V.R.C. Newmarket
Handicap in 1885, and some £70,000 was landed in
bets. #
“O’Cork” : J. O’Reilly, jockey, of W.A.,
who won the recent Perth Cup on Dollar Dictator,
handed a cold chop to that arrant foolery, inter-
viewing the winning jockey.” Instead of blatantly
feeding the reporter, as do the star mannikins of the
eastern States, with a lot of necessarily-imaginative
“details of the race,” O'Reilly briefly remarked, in
a rather bored tone of voice: “All I know about the
race is that I looked after my own horse and had
a clear, easy ride right through, without any trouble
at all.” Then he slipped away to ride in the Sap-
ling Stakes, and became some more winning jockey.
DAVE SMITH, TUG.
I. T. Garslake, the old and somewhat
disrespected Vic. trainer of gee-gees, died in Mel-
bourne last vveeek, aged 78. The snows of winter
never settled on Garslake s head, for in his middle
age his hair was dyed jet black, and, later on, he
were a dissipated-looking wig of raven hue. One
of the last horses of note that he owned and trained
was Straightfire, which ran some good races when on
the job, but was usually . off the job. Straightfire
.must have been alive or dead in nearly 100 races
altogether, and he was an 8-vear-old, with 7st. 81b.
lip when he ran second to Cremorne for a Caulfield
Cup. The late £ £ Smith of old confided his
racers to Carslake’s care. When the old man was
dropping out of notice his son, Brownie Carslake,
came to light as a successful jockey. Brownie was
jockeying in Austria when the war broke out.
Died recently in Melbourne a Hindu
Owner Of raceliorses named Mukand Lai, known
among- his compatriots as “the Prince.” Inciden-
tally, lie supplied his fellow-countrymen with hawk-
ers’' goods. Lh'l” started a disastrous turf experience
with a big bank balance, which grew gradually
smaller and beautifully less. Among his horses
was the famous Slipper, sometimes known as the
slippery Slipper.” Whenever Lai and his brethren
backed the animal it lost. When it was not fancied
by the discolored stable it invariably won. Lai
tried several trainers, but with no personal success.
Vt last he leased his gee-gees. Just about there he
died and the doctor said the trouble was consump-
tion’ Hard luck isn’t on the list of diseases.
Tasmania is to see a son of Carbine under
silk during its coming big meetings at Hobart and
Launceston. This is the imported Defence, who
was purchased a little while back by A. Wooliscio
from Baillieu Bros., of Melbourne. Defence was
one of the “also rans” in last Melbourne Cup, and
that about represents his general form to date.
* * *
Something by way of coincidence. At the
Hawkes Bav (M.L.) Jockey Club’s meeting on Janu-
ary 1 the Scurry Handicap, five furlongs, for- which
there were 10 starters, resulted: Multiplication, 1,
Multiplicity, 2 ; Multifical, 3. All three horses are
by Multifid (a good performer of five or six years
ago), and started first, second and fourth favontes
respectively.
The late Isaac Carslake, of Melbourne,
was known in his younger days as “Tommy Jones.”
As a jockey he was always Tommy Jones, and he took
out his training license in that name. “Carslake”
being so much more tony a name than “Jones,”
the old generation ot' racegoers never gave Isaac
credit for having inherited it, and when he registered
his proper appellation With the racing clubs he was
generally suspected of disguising himself in an alias.
Two sons of Carbine have now won the
Hobart Cup: Flintlock, a grey, who collected it in
1899, and Defence, who won the other day. Defence
was imported from England by the brothers Baillieu
(Melb.), and was owned by them until a few weeks
ago, when he was sold for 500 guineas. It is a pity
he is a gelding, as Carbine’s sons have all done well
at the stud. Flintlock, now in Westralia, is a case
in point.
* * * *
Monday’s sculling match over the Parra-
matta course between Alf Felton, of Sydney, and
Robert Ford, of the Hunter, for a wager of £2OO a
side, was a gift for Felton. Despite statements
ascribed to Northern judges, the match was gener-
ally looked unon as more than a doubtful sporting
proposition; for Felton has beaten Charlie Towns
• and Harry Pearce, and has done well at handicap
racing; whereas Ford, 24 years of age, has practically
done nothing outside handicap racing. On Monday
he rowed nicely, but entirely without dash, and his
opponent had the money in his pocket before a mile
had been covered. The verdict of umpire Bill Beach
was that a length and a half separated the men at
the gun, but • that was letting Ford down without
too cruel a bump.
Webb, of Wanganui, lias agreed to row
Hannan on the Wanganui for the championship of
Maoriland and £2OO a side at the end of May. That
is final—at time of writing.
Fritz Holland, the bald-headed welter
phenomenon from the U.S., clashed with Dave Smith,
heavyweight champion of Australia, at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday - night. It was one of the
closest and best fights .ever seen at that resort. There
is really little more ip say about it. Fritz fought
with extraordinary speed and' ■driming; Dave with
tremendous power and skill .and''*resolution. They
both took heavy punishment, I>JVe looked rather the
worse of the. two, owing to his Yankee friend’s
attentions to his eye's, but Fritz probably felt as
bad as anyone in the house from time to time.
Nevertheless he kept his customary smile glued on
his countenance to the end. Neither went within
miles of knocking the other out. Towards the finish
every man with long hair, high-heeled hoots and a
wad' of chewing-gum in his mouth opined that Fritz
had won by as much as from Hoboken to Chicago ;
most of the rest of the spectators reckoned that Dave
was simply giving Holland a boxing lesson. One or
two advanced the view that a draw would be a fair
thing, and were howled at furiously. Harald Baker
said the winner was Dave Smith. It was a fair
decision. #
How futile it is, by the' way. for anyone
to be dogmatic about a boxing match! Last week
Jeff Smith hit Darcy low, and indicated that he
knew he had erred by standing off while his seconds
besought him to go in and finish his wilting oppo-
nent. Six ring.-sid.ers to whom the writer -spoke
never saw the blow. The writer, who was opposite
Dave Smith, did not see that astute second throw in
the towel. At every contest all the experts round
the ring miss dozens of hits. So. of course, does the
referee. Harald Baker, for example, with all his
advantages, missed the low hit in the Darev-Smith
disturbance. If people who are within a few feet
of the fight fail to note so many details, how much
less equipped to blither are the uproarious ones on
the back seats! The plain fact is that no one sees
more than about three-quai;ters of anv fight ; and
that is not nearly enough for spectators to. judge
arrogantly on. #
.Timmy Hill lias at last forfeited the Aus-
tralian featherweight title. He doesn’t like making
the weight, and he never gets any peace from
aspirants to the title. The featherweight gaud is the
most sought after in Australia. Geikie, Melville,
Thorn —all Bananalanders —-Ellis and Simpson claim
the goods, and each can show some cause for his
claim. The title reverts to Queenslander Joey Russel,
who has been resting. He intends to come forth
from seclusion and argue the case.
Bill Turner, one time a white hope and
recently heavyweight champion of Tassy, has joined
the Salv’army in Hobart. Bill's unpalatable left
will henceforth be used to uppercut Satan.
Maxwell Walker, who, at Auckland, won
the singles championship at the recent Maoriland
bowling tournament, has been one of the best-
known trundlers at tournaments in the quaking
islands for years. The final game which brought
him the championship was played against Stokes, of
Grey Lynn. At the fifth head the game was, three
all; at the seventh, 5—4 in Stok’es’s,favor. Then
Walker got a run, and at tlfe eleventh head led
10—5. He continued to itiow away, and. at the
sixteenth score was 15- 7. At the eighteenth
head the game was given up. The winner is Pro-
fessor of Modern Languages at Auckland University
College. ' # #
Victoria’s defeat of N.'S.W. by 16 runs
leaves the Sheffield Shield in an , interesting position.
There is one more match on the slate —S. Aus. -u,
Victoria at Adelaide, and, even if Vic. wins, the
Shield will have to be decided on averages. Vic. and
Ma are in this position:—
N.K.W.
For .. . 74 wickets, for, 1851. runs—average 25.01
Against ..80 Wickets for 1073 runs—average 20.91
Credit margin . 4,10
VICTOKIA.
For 00 wickets,for 1408 runs-average 23.46
Against .. 54 wickets fpr-1149 runs—average 21.2/
Credit piargin . • 2 - 19
Victoria can thank J. S-. Byder for its
victory over N.S.W. Things were blue for the
Southerners' when -Ryder brought oft a sensationa
catch at cover-point and dismissed Mailey, who had
been helping Bardsley to pull the game out of the
fire Further, Ryder was top-scorer in both innings
(55 and 93 not out)’, and captured two wickets for
19 in one innings. In three matches for A ictoria in
inter-State cricket this season he has piled up 267
runs (highest aggregate on his side), and his aver-
age stands at 66.75.
Victorian left-hander 11. Ironmonger
bowled “a treat" in N.S.W. second innings, and
finished with six wickets for 73 runs. This seasons
Sheffield Shield matches have been his harvest. He
has taken 26 wickets for 409 runs, which over-
shadows all other efforts with the ball in the
tourney. Incidentally, this is Ironmonger’s first year
in the' inter-State class. ■
Another coincidence. On the first day of
the Victorian-N. S. Wales match 250 runs were
scored, and the same number was accumulated on
each of two days in the South Aus.-N. S. Wales
match. #
Since The Bulletin last blossomed Vic-
toria has been walloping two of the lesser-powerful
cricket States —Queensland and Tasmania. the
operations were conducted simultaneously at Bris-
bane and Melbourne. The Northerners were downed
by 10 wickets in the match, and the Apple
Islanders went out by an innings and 130
runs. In the Vic.-Tassy game the latter s
team seemed paralysed by the score ot 444
stacked up against it in the first innings Any-
how, all the batsmen could rake up m retaliation
was 48. Of that score, 25 was credited to S. Lord.
The attack was conducted by Allen and Hart, the
former taking four wickets for 23 and the latter six
for 23. At the inglorious conclusion of the matcli
in the North, a “return,” or scratch match was
entered upon. It was very much scratch, and ended
in a draw. #
“Stumps”: Cricket is threatened with
extinction unless interest in it can be revived. lo
me it seems that more suddenness must be intro-
duced. In no other sport or pastime (billiards is a
business) is the agony prolonged over one day.
Events like race meetings, which are strung out o\ei
a week, arc complete each day. People have acquired
the habit of wanting to see the finish before bedding
down for the night, and the cricket enthusiast who
pays his money on Friday, knowing that the result
Won’t arrive until Wednesday next is getting
scarcer. Cricket on baseball lines ought to make a
good game, with rules so framed that quick run-
getting would be essential, tour spells to each side
(sav, half an hour long) at the wicket, alternately,
could be allowed, each side to make as many runs
as time permitted, irrespective of the fall of wmkete
o' •>« in baseball, (sav) five out all out. The result
would be quite unlike the game of cricket handed
down bv tradition, but it would make fo a-„ood
afternoon’s sport; and what is tradition that spoit
should be sacrificed to it? # *
Roy Hill, fast bowler and free hat, and
the next-best of Clem Hill’s many cricketing bro-
thers has “come back” to district matches in
Adelaide after having retired for 2k veais. On lu.
first reappearance he made 53, and took three wickets
for 35. „ *
* * *
“Bails”: Seems that petty squabbles
weakened the N. S. Wales team against Victoria At
least, that was the gossip. How is it that b lynn.
Bull and Farrar found places? In shoit, how i-
that probably a better N.S.W. team watched the
game than took part in it? It wasn’t because the
cracks had gone to the wars and it wasn t because
there was anv anxiety to give the colts a chance.
The originally selected team merely melted
and disappeared, and it seems to me that local
cricket, which is at a low ebb now, wont be am
healthier until the trouble is exposed and removed.
S. Australian 100 yards amateur swim-
ming champ, has been won—in the enclosed fresh-
water City Baths—by R. C. Howe secretary of the
Semaphore Club. He deserved the titie having
been kept out of it last year only by Wickham,
who happened to be visiting Adelaide just then J.
Farrellv was beaten by a yard, and, being only 1 .
and member of a famous swimming family, will
doubtless go up higher in due time. the veteian
Moon was outpaced. ,
Running in Maoriland is reaching for some
of its old fame, owing, to an extent, to the deeds
of A. W. Dormer, an Auckland ex-amateur. He has
made an engagement to race W. F. rembath o
Core (M.L.) for a substantial purse-and £lOO sirte
wager. The winner will then look for a match with
E. Bergneier (Vic.) over a half-mile track. me
times of these three men over that distanc'd aie
only fractions apart.
* * * - *
The English supporters of Australia s
sprint freak, Donaldson, are far from satisfied that
their man’s recent defeat by England s ex-amateur
streak, Applegarth, was proof of track superiority.
Both men Were entered for the New Year s Day
Handicap at Rowderhall, and both were on scratch.
Donaldson won, but the brief cable concerning the
race did not say if Applegarth made the journey.
Anyhow a series of matches between the runners is
a sure thing, and. already negotiations have been
floated for a dash over 200yds. for a £5O purse.

“The Bunkered Idiot” : I can see a green
mile of golf-links spread out like a carpet, and
specks of golfers making their religious procession
across it. Thev interrupt their mysterious pilgrim-
age every little while to bend double and lean then
foreheads on the grass. This- act of worship is
addressed to the invisible lost ball, which, when you.
are close up to it, is about as small as a dray-
horse’s liver pill. The ball’s,, part of the game is
to lie quietly under a tuft of grass and say nothing.
It does it splendidly; in fact, the reticence of the
lost golf-ball is a lesson to the . Kaiser, that patter-
comedian of the battlefield. Doubledmp: golfers with
empurpled faces may kick the grass oi the field and
howl inquiries all round—the .remains stolidly
in hiding, and doesn’t even betray itself
in its sleeve. I have seen this sort of thing many
times and, because I am convinced that golfers hate
it I ’ am' perfecting a new ball ■ with fi’i interim
rattle which will be wound up by the caddie befoie
the ball is clubbed by the maniac it belongs to.
The rattle will be started by the impact and will
continue for a minute. Besides facilitating the d,s-
coverv of the wretched mil it will make the m-'
more like that of a shell, and obviate the necessity
of shouting explosively at inoffensive grangers who
happen to be in the way. I also intern ‘ni S oa?
golf balls with interior phonographs which will soar
through the air shouting such phrases as Lookout,
vou fool!” and “I belong to Murphy! , but, ot
course, these will be more expensive.

foaled. These long, flap saddles
and the leather points to the

Saddle—it has just the right dip.
The seat in No. 59 takes a bit of
beating, too —it has the right clip
and narrow waist. A chap would
only leave that saddle for a

The man whom the Turks really miss is
old Moses. He led his great expedition out
of Egypt along the dry route which the
Ottoman army, now making for Egypt, re-
gards as little short of hopeless. But Moses
had a habit of striking the rock when
water ran short, and he always got a sup-
ply. Nowadays there is abundance of rock
but not a pennyworth of Moses.
Joe Cook, ex-Prime Minister and naval
expert, is also orchardist at Ivoro-Vo, Baulk-
ham Hills, a charming spot near Parramatta,
where Mrs. Cook makes the family jam,
raises the family egg and chicken, and culti-
vates the strictly domestic virtues. Here
many little Cooks live a care-free life, just
as happy as if Pa had never been turned
down by a capricious public. A son, an
enthusiastic young man, manages the
orchard, and this year got a revenue ot
£4 13s. fid. from a single plum tree.
Dead at Bathurst (N.S.W.) Henry King,
whose title to fame rests on the tact that he
helped to unearth the huge nugget (6301 b.
gross) which was found in the claim ot
Beyers and Holtermann, at Hawkins Hill,
on June 21. 1871. When cleaned up the
speck yielded £12,000. Holterman com-
menced* as a digger in 1856 at. Hawkins
Hill (Hill End). Two years later the
workings were given up, gold being too
scarce. After various unsflccessful resump-
tions, in the beginning of 1871 he opened
out a vein yielding 50oz. per ton- J°e y ® rs i
promptly sold out his shares for £*o,ooo. but
llolterman held on and didn’t do much good
afterwards. Before he ‘‘struck it ’ he kept a
barber’s shop at Hill End.
The destroyers built at Cockatoo Dock
(NS.W.) are not the first war vessels con-
structed in Australia. No. 1 was the 60-ton
Spitfire, launched from Cuthbert’s yard
(Sydney) during the Russian scare in 1855.
Its dimensions were 51ft. on the keel, lbtt.
beam, and sft. 6in. draught. It carried one
long 32-pounder on a traversing carriage.
When the scare petered out the craft was
employed tending the lighthouses, and, later
on, it humped produce from the Northern
Rivers to Sydney. In 1865, about the end
ot the United States Civil War, Victoria tried
its hand, at Williamstown, on a weird “gun-
raft,” consisting of two flat, hardwood boats,
fastened together and covered so as to form
a platform 46ft. long and 28ft. wide. Upon
this was mounted a smooth-bore b2-pounder.
“Moutere”: The badly worn silver-coin
nuisance is rather acute in Sydney just now.
Almost every day I get a doubtful coin from
somebody and wear out my life trying to
trade it off on somebody else. Often there
is a slight indication of engraving on it
when held sideways to the light, but I can t
get tram conductors to juggle with it long
enough to convince themselves that it really
is a piece of minted metal. The matter
becomes serious when it is my last coin and
it is a case of walking home if I can't cash
it. Surely there ought to be some means ot
getting such stuff out of circulation. While
it remains it is a constant cause of loss to
the poorer members of the community ; but,
then, why should a Labor Government worry
• about the poor? They vote instinctively for
Labor, and if they were better off they
mightn’t. Which is a piece of political
philosophy as old as the pyramids and as
corrupting as a portfolio.
“Gombi”: The Law an ass? Nonsense!
Listen to my story. In a township on the
lower Darling consisting of four pubs, two
other houses and a sandheap, the local con-
stable summoned two men for language.
The P.M. travelled 150 miles to hear
cases, and was assisted by a J.P. The
Bench disagreed, and the cases were ad-
journed. Next month a new P.M. travelled
'350 miles and then adjourned the case, as
the J.P. and P.M. at the first hearing were
not present. P.M. No. 1 started off for the
next court, but was bogged half-way by a
mixture of one inch of rain and two of dust.
Next month the cases were withdrawn, and
Justice was satisfied. The expenses ran to
about £lOO. And nobody knows if the two
men used the wicked words or not, though
everybody knows that there isn’t a soul in the
place who hasn’t used worse when the local
goat has insisted on breaking in and eating
his last sock.
“J.G.”: Has any Bulletin reader met. a
shortish little man clad in a pepper and salt
suit, wearing a squat little boxer on his head
and carrying a. well-thumbed bible under ins
arm? When he struck our place the other
day and knocked at the door I expected to
fin'd one of the usual duns or hawkers on
the mat. But the little man wasn’t one.
He nodded to me, opened his. Bible, and said
that he was merely sowing a few seeds oy
the wayside. Then he read a line or two,
closed the Book, clapped it under his arm,
said good-day, and moved on. _ I watched
him visit two or three of my neighbors, and
he went through the same brief performance
with them. He was one of the most indus-
trious sowers of seed I ever knew, but his
chances of a good harvest are meagre. lo
get anv sort of a crop you must harrow the
seed in. My industrious friend merely
scattered it on the surface, as it were, and
the old carnal crows came and —where, alas,
was the seed?
Houston Stewart Chamberlain, a rene-
gade Englishman who has settled in Bavaria,
has pumped in a good deal of the hot air
which fills the afflicted German head. A
son of the late Rear-Admiral William
Charles Chamberlain, this unbalanced Eng-
lishman married the only daughter of
Richard Wagner, the poet and composer;
and after that he became more pro-German
than the Prussians themselves. He went
to Dresden in 18S5, possibly with the in-
tention of settling there, but five years
later passed on to Vienna, where he re-
mained until 1908. In 1892 he began
writing (in German) books belauding the
German and Germanic peoples. He asserts
(particularly in his “Foundations of the
19th Century”) that the Germans are the
true Chosen People, and that all the great-
est men of history have been of Germanic
blood. Even St. Paul! In fact, he suspects
Jesus of being a German. Whereupon a
German writer, J. L. Reimer, recalls that
Jesus had the blue eyes and roseate skin
of the Teuton, and alleges that the name
Jesus mpans nothing more nor less than
German!

Sy “ fCat-ar-ah” Treatment
the Nose and Throat are
treated effectively with
Medicated Oxygen inhaled
direct to the afflicted mem-
branes.
** Kat-ar-ah ** Treatment
has a direct influence upon
the catarrhal poisons of
the body and conquers the
disease by removing the
cause.
Are You a Victim of
CATARRH!
You know what Catarrh is, with its humiliating and discomfort-
ing symptoms.
A slight cold develops into a stubborn and protracted one, while
the discharges from the nose are most offensive and annoying.
As the inflammation extends further up into tire head and the
delicate mechanism of the ear is attacked, there is a continual
buzzing and ringing in the ears, and frequently the hearing is
partially or totally lost. Headaches are almost constant, wit 1
sometimes acute pains in the eyes, and the nose becomes s>
plugged up that the patient must breathe through the mouth,
while the slimy secretions are forced back into the throat,
requiring almost continual hawking and spitting to dislodge them.
At certain stages of the disease the odor of the breath becomes
very bad, to the mortification and embarrassment of the sufferers,
and the disgust of all who come near them. Gradually the
mucous discharge finds its way into the internal organs, and a
most miserable form of Dyspepsia, or Catarrh of the Stomach, is
the inevitable consequence. The blood becomes contaminated by
catarrhal poisons and unhealthy matter, and these are
distributed through the body.
Catarrh is then a deep-seated, dangerous, constitutional or
systemic disease, and its effect upon the general health and
system is soon apparent —appetite and strength are gone, weight
is lost, despondency takes the place of confidence, and the disease
frequently settles in’some vital organ or terminates in Bronchitis,
Asthma, Neuritis, or dread Consumption.
Trial Bottle of
“Kal-ar-ah” Inhalant
FREE
I want all who are afflicted with Catarrh to try a sample bottle of “Kat-
ar-ah ” Inhalant at my expense. It is a synthetic compound of certain
valuable medicaments, and is supremely beneficial in *t.s influence on the
mucous membrane. It has a distinctly soothing, healing and aro-sanatne
effect, sufficient todisintegrate and dislodge the slimy mucous accumulations.
“Kat-ar-ah” is first aid to Catarrh sufferers. Its healing effects are
simply marvellous. You can notice an improvement immediately after
beginning its use. If quickly takes up its work of killing the disease
germs, of minimising and eventually stopping the discomforting mucous
discharges in .he nose and throat —mucous that is finding its way into
your stomach and poisoning your system.
X will supply you with a Trial Bottle of “ Kat-ar-ah ’’ Inhalant FREE OF
CHARGE, if you will send me your full name and address, together with
3d. in stamos’ to cover cost of postage. Write address plainly, state
whether Mr., Mrs., or Miss, and be sure to mention this paper. Send
for your bottle NOW.

To meet in price, in Solid Silver, the demand for the necessi-

of time and attention to them, with the result that he ordered
many hundreds at so much an ounce, and allowed the makers
to turn them out in slack times.
We therefore are now able to sell here the pair of heavy,
Solid Silver, Hall-marked Pourers—or 1 Pepper and 1 Salt.

There is nothing much in that to interest
the old Land Mortgage Bank shareholders.
A few years back, when the unfortunate
concern was trying to make the job of dying
as painless as possible, the Freehold Assets
Co. stepped in, bought practically the whole
of the shares, and is now watching its pur-
chase die. It shouldn’t have to watch for
very long. Of the host of properties thrown
on its hands after the smash there is only
£lO worth left. All that remains, therefore,
is to go on collecting the balance of purchase
money as it becomes due. This shows how
the job is progressing

much the old Land Mortgage shareholders
are to the bad is too painful a subject to

As the profits shown for the half-year have
been reduced by £164 for depreciation of
premises, the co. has done exceedingly well,
War and drought have raged; but evidently
they haven’t yet cut into the commission
earnings. And the co. has other earnings
which will tend to grow rather than shrink
with bad times. It has a paid capital of
£20,000, and’of this and its reserves no less
than £34.461 is in public securities. From
money dropped into such property the
return for the next few years is likely to
be higher rather than lower. All round, the
investments, in spite of their gilt-edged
character, supply probably 7 p.c. on the capi-
tal ; and that doesn’t leave a great deal tor
the commissions to do in order to keep the
present 11 p.c. div. going. The co. doesn t
publish a profit and loss account showing
its commissions separately ; but it mentions
that the value of the trust estates in hand
is £1,884,081. Six months ago the total
was £1,817,893, and 10 years ago £981,021.
Substantial business is thus assured no
matter how bad a slump there may be. In
that respect a trustee co. is unusually lucky.
A man can’t postpone his death just because
things have gone flat. So the jobs of the
undertaker and the trustee co. go on just
as usual, even though both of them may
have to give more funeral for less money.
Big Hill Central. Stawell (Vic.), the
show that was worked by Wilkinson and
Co., may yet prove a valuable stand-by to
the mining industry of the district. A good
deal of prospecting work has been done by
the present co. on the large bodies of low
grade ore, and the results are cheering—in
fact, of late, payable. At the 150 ft. level
150 ft. of ore is already proved, assaying
from 10s. to 50s. for a width of 14ft.. while
at the 75ft. level another large body of
payable ore has been proved so far for a
length of 130 ft. The assays are very good
and regular, while a rise going up at one
place is in ore assaying £5 18s., showing
that the bonanza stuff is not yet all ex-
tracted in Stawell. Appearances at present
justify the prediction that the Hampshire
end of the Big Hill, so long neglected until
Wilkinson and his party attacked it, .may
compensate for the waning fortunes of the
Magdala and Sloane’s end. It is certain
that in turning down the option once held
over the property the S. Australian and
Westralian slimes plant crowd threw away
a better thing than they knew.

Mount Bischoff (Tas.) is trying hard to
restore its fortunes. Manager Millen has
visited Melbourne to. explain matters, but
the market seems indifferent. All the same,
the recovery of metal prices and a new
smelting contract with Y Water (N.S.W.)
will help this old concern. Bischoff is smelt-
ing without purchase, which is good to the
man who expects a speedy rise. This policy
has enabled it to get the Briseis business;
and Briseis has been for years the largest
alluvial tin producer in Tasmania. There
isn’t, indeed, the slightest excuse for send-
ing tin concentrates to be smelted in the
Straits or Europe. We have just-as-good
smelters at Sydney (N.S.W.), Launceston
(Tas.) and Irvinebank (Q.).

THE history of the piano industry in Australia is a record of
a long and continuous struggle against clever and unscrupulous
German methods. The strong anti-German feeling engendered
by the present war has not dictated the attitude of Australian piano
manufacturers, whose interests lie now, but no more than they have
always done, absolutely parallel with the advance of the British
Empire, and the victory of the Allies in Europe.
The production of pianos in Australia has afforded employment
to many hundreds of highly-skilled and highly-paid Australian
craftsmen; has assisted in the development of other Australian
industries, both primary and secondary, but has in no wa;y contributed
to the building of German Dreadnoughts, the equipment of German
soldiers, nor the purchase of the shells and bullets to shoot down our

Beale & Co. Ltd. are the founders of piano manufacture in
Australia. The business was established over 18 years ago by its
present controlling Director, Mr. O. C. Beale (born at Mount Mellick,
Oueen County, Ireland) ; the Directors and Managers throughout
the business are also descendants of British families for many
generations-; the whole of the capital employed is entirely Australian,
and the few necessary supplies for the factories are Australian or
from the countries of the Allies.
Your personal judgment of Beale Pianos and Beale Player-
Pianos is sought, and we will demonstrate their superiority —fully.

THE HYGIENE OF THE HOME !
Despite all modern safeguards; commonsense is often set at
naught. The careful housewife who studies the security of
her Home should see that
Hycol
Disinfectant
Is used throughout It regularly.
Hycol hreathes purity and cleanliness—for no
disease germs can possibly live in Its Influence. The
floors, the sinks, the drains, lavatories and waste-
pipes should be constantly flushed with Hycol —the
most potent preventive of disease.
During the hot weather a few drops of Hycol mixed
with water for flushing and cleansing makes an
excellent deodorant.
Directions for use on every package.
Hycol is NON-POISONOUS, NON-IRRITANT,
and is TWENTY TIMES STRONGER as a
germ-killer than Carbolic Acid.
Of all High-Class Chemists and Storekeepers, in Bottles or Drums.
For further particulars apply to H. A. REEVES,

The Deadly Submarine
Of all the engines of war, the submarine is just now
very much in evidence. It may be of interest to know
that the motive power for submarines when travelling
on the surface is motor spirit, large quantities of Pratt’s
brand being used for this purpose. When submerged,
however, the power and light are derived from electric
storage batteries, which have previously been charged
by the motor-engines above referred to. This use of
electricity permits of movements under water without
the tell-tale exhaust of a motor engine, besides pre-
serving the purity of the atmosphere in the submarine
—thus enabling long journeys under water to be made.
N.B.—Pratt’* enjoy* the full confidence of the
Allies, who are using it in enormous quantities.

Amber ola
Phonographs
Amberolas are talking machines that cannot fail to please yon —
everyone loves the entertainment that they afford. They are
beautiful in tone, graceful in design, and their construction is
perfect.
You should certainly possess one of these splendid instruments. It
will add wonderfully to the pleasure of your home life, enable you
to turn every spare moment to enjoyment, and have you always
prepared for company.
The Amberolas —according to model —cost from £B/10/- to £45,
and each one is worth many times its cost.
Prices have not advanced.
T j ‘■■•i 4
The increase of Customs duty on phonograph goods will not affect our
prices for the present. You can buy at the regular prices now and avoid
paying the increased rates which are sure to follow.
Call on your nearest Edison dealer and ask him to go into the matter of an
Amberola with you. Or, if you wish it, we will send a descriptive booklet,
post free on request. Write for it to-day.

SPOONS & FORKS
There’s ONE point about Stewart Dawson’s A 1
Silverplate which stamps it as worth while —the
SERVICE FEATURE.
AI Plate has been made in England for us to give
many years of solid, lasting satisfaction. The
base of the Plate is solid White Metal, and is
covered with a quadruple deposit of genuine
Silver. Just where the ware wears—there’s a
specially-thick deposit to prevent rubbing.
Because it is honestly made, Al Plate can be
depended upon to last a lifetime, and—long after
the price is forgotten—it will be in constant,
everyday use.

IN BANANA LAND
“Politicus”: Re boycotting of Teutonic
goods. We are too fond of assuming that
after the war nobody will buy stuff “made in
Germany.” The public memory is always
short, the public conscience mostly negli-
gible. When Wilberforce was beating the
anti-slavery drum a London draper put up
a placard : “No goods made with slave-grown
cotton sold here.” A -rival opposite put up
a sign: “All goods made with cheap, slave-
grown cotton.” The latter got the trade.
Moral: Trust the people, but keep your tariff
“high.”
“Cleveland” from the North:—
“Tula” (B. 14/1/’l5) throws more light on the
question of the destruction of N.Q. timbers than
most correspondents. Like him, I hate to see good
commercial timber going up in smoke ; but the posi-
tion is that the small cocky has to start in and make
good pretty early in the deal, unless he wishes to be
strangled by the mortgage or the bank. Now,
making good requires the removal of unsuitable
vegetables from the holding promptly, so that cane
may be grown or forage provided for Strawberry.
The cocky will discuss till the cows come home how
many figures his cheques would run into if he could
get the wood to market. Southern theorists, who
cry out about the iniquity of destroying so much
fine timber, ought to come up and show how it is
to be saved. If there’s even a pound an acre in it,
we want that pound badly. We don’t burn the
stuff for fun. “Well, let it stand,” says the critic,
taking up his last trench. Certainly; but what good
is that to anybody ?
“McNortli”: North Queensland has once
more appealed to the Commonwealth Weather-
Bureau for a meteorological station, and
has once more been given the answer that
encourages wrath. The present system of
telegraphing from Melbourne warning of an
approaching disturbance is of little use, for
the hurricane that destroys houses and ships
is also liable to smash telegraph lines and
interfere with wireless, and the man in
Cairns who, after watching his house and
props aeroplane over the horizon, receives a
“wire” from the South announcing that the
whirling devastation is on its way is apt to
be sarcastic. At some places on the N.Q.
coast no weather notices at ajl are posted
from Saturday night to Monday morning.
So the cyclone, which is a sinner and no
respecter of the Sabbath, has 30 hours each
week-end in which to approach unadver-
tised. The remarks, opinions and disserta-
tions of coastal skippers in this connection
will be forwarded on application wrapped
in asbestos., Last year the citizens of Cairns
and Townsville tried to establish a station
of their own, but the project fell through
for some reason or other. Lots of projects
fall through for some reason or other.
THE . LATE LAMENTED.
The contemplated freak will almost certainly be a serious dislocation of the business of the Com-
monwealth merely to satisfy a wish to placate Sydney.— Melbourne Age on temporary transfer of
Federal business to Sydney.
SYDNEY PRESS: “If you keep on walloping him from your end , we might get a kick out
of the old boss yet.”
The Queensland climate goes about its
business in a treacherous way. Any self-
respecting, deadly heat would let its victims
know it was killing them. The Bananaland
article just lures them on. The usual coun-
try crowd had gathered at a Dalby pub the
other day to talk the same old crops and
weather and politics. To vary proceedings
someone remarked that the company was a
very fragile lot, and proposed that it should
adjourn to the nearest weighbridge. There
were 15 of them, and their average weight
was lost. 71b. One of the crowd, aged 34,
was 17st. 41b. ; two others (aged 44 and 35)
couldn’t do better than 15st. odd ; three went
between 14st. and 15st., and the rest, with
the exception of a midget of 9st. 111 b., went
over 12st. A climate that treats a doomed
crowd like that has a lot to live down.
From London
“The most continuously beautiful of the Australian
States..!’ Native-born residents of long standing
might {pause before being dogmatic on that subject;
but your rev. tripping tourist has no difficulty in
making up his mind on the evidence of a few days’
observation from railway-carriage windows. The Rev.
Dr. Adeney, who recently went to Australia to whip
up the Congregationalists, pins the ribbon on Queens-
land’s broad bosom. Brisbane is “really a wonder,”
and its Queen-street is the champion thoroughfare of
the Commonwealth. Toowoomba is “a holiday resort
and place of retirement for elderly folks.” Queens-
land houses are built on piles to ‘'avoid the white
ants, provide a security against floods, and furnish a
nice shady place under the floor for the family wash-
ing.” But the soul of Adeney was shocked and
grieved at the discovery that there were less than 30
Congregational churches to add to the continuous
beauty of the North.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Was there nobody there when the moon was
full?
It might have been only a crackling leaf,
Or a petal blown from a blossom sheaf *
Or the snap of a burst toadstool.
Yet in humble flowers and haughty weeds
I heard the call of a pipe of reeds!
A minor lilt to the blare of day,
The garden at night held its usual sound —
The suspiration of sweating ground
Would explain it all away—
But not the flicker of flaming eyes
Or the vines a-trail from the shaggy thighs!
Oh, yes! We can prove so much indeed!
Did the rosy “Pride of India” move
Looping the trellis close as love,
With its lavish jungle weed.
Some crawling snail we should find, no doubt,
Or a sportive spider swinging out!
We could cry it was only wind of dawn,
The moan bf dreams that the. wakeful hear;
But a rose leaned down to the pointed ear
Of a crafty, peering faun —
And it was never a dawn bird’s throat
That gave the breath for that trickling note!
Was nobody there when the moon was full?
The dove cote sheltered a grey quartette,
But they slept, lid-blind, to the moonbeams’
fret.
Nor guessed at the silver pull
That drew me out of a restless bed
To lurk in a coppice heart instead !
The rose clung shuddering to her stem.
Fluttered the leaves on her dainty tree
As she sobbed : “He is here to rifle me”
’Neath her dewdrop diadem.
And yet when the thin faun lips drew near
I heard her coo to his furtive ear!
Was nobody there through the unmarked
hours?
A quince-rod bent in the grove beyond.
A shadow passed o’er the gleaming pond
Of a head enwreathed with flowers.
And this morning, deep in the moss-mat’s
woof
I found the print of a blunted hoof!
And the rose—no more will her red heart
stir.
She is bruised and wilted and spent and
torn,
As though the burden of lust was borne
And the soul kissed out of her.
But she did not turn from me as I came.
She seemed too weary to think of shame.
Was there nobody there when the moon was
full?
It might have been only a widening leaf
Where an opening moonflower sighed relief,
Or the puff of a dried toadstool....
Yet all day one voice in the leaf choir leads
The echo left by a pipe of reeds!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, January 30, 1915.
My Dear Tiiargomindaii,—
The other day the Mayoress presided over
a band of eager women, who decided to
induce the public to go to a carefully-pre-
pared aquatic carnival on February 27, and
shell out just a little bit more towards the
squelching of the Prussian. Mrs. Jenkinson
was in the same chair an hour or two later,
encouraging another party of helpers, who
will commence operations on February 17,
with a concert in aid of the aeroplane fund.
I think no other State has an aeroplane
fund. Barrister “Tom” Macleod is the lead-
ing spirit here. He is a Queenslander who,
some time ago, went to England and quali-
fied in aviation. His flying pal, Jones, is
English-born, but has become air-naturalised
along the Downs. These two, with 18 or
20 helpers, have been toiling for the past
six weeks at the construction of an aero-
plane, which, when completed, is to be used
to instruct ambitious local youths how to
fly, so that in the near future the Australian
forces may include native airmen. True,
the Government had thought of the same
thing, and has its own machines and in-
structors. Still, Macleod and his machine
are not likely to be in the way.
Violet Paget is busy on,her campaign in
aid of the fund for the dependents of sol-
diers. On February 16 she will direct a
matinee at Palace Gardens, where all the
theatrical shows in Brisbane will be repre-
sented. That this fund is deserving is bet-
ter realised since the first few deaths have
occurred in Egypt. One soldier left a wife
and seven little Australians.
Canon and Mrs. Hay, who have been to
England, returned home recently, and this
afternoon the entire parish, or as much of
it as wasn’t in hospital, or at the races, or
otherwise engaged, rolled up to Mrs. Kenric
Brodribb’s moated grange and expressed
pleasure at having once more in their midst
the Christian influence and example of the
wanderers. The shepherd spake unto them,
saying: “Do! the admiration is mutual.”
Talking about shepherds, it will no doubt
interest you to know, my dear, that Com-
mander Davies, of the Tiger, which helped it-
self to some made-in-Germany navy the other
day in the North Sea, has a brother in
Bananaland. He also is a fighter, and de-
votes his energies to the battle which is
without end against the Devil, the founder of
the Gerhog house; The Queensland mem-
ber of the family goes to the root of things,
while the naval scion attends to details.
Mrs. Price, of Ashton Hall, Albion, gave
a pleasant party this afternoon, in honor of
her son Jack and his new and ornamental
bride. Another pretty girl wil join the
great mixed pairs handicap next Wednes-
day, when Mollie Ferrier will take for a
partner Julian Mackay, who is a squatter
by trade, somewhere in N.S.W.
Miss Laage, the popular and energetic
headmistress of the Girls’ Central State
School, is hack from England, after a holiday
of 12 months. She brought with her a supply
of up-to-date information and a store of fresh
health.
The Q.T.C. races to-day were fairly-well
attended, and the congregation included the
Arthur Morgans and daughter Alice. Mrs.
Cecil Palmer wore one of the new checked
voiles in her favorite shade —blue. Mrs.
Arthur Pierson sported an enviable ostrich
plume, and Mrs. Blume was also conspicu-
ous under ostrich foliage. The lioss Munro
family wore, amongst other things, an air
of excitement when the family horse came
forth to carry the family purse. I forget
where he left it.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
A patient man is Daniels, ex-M.L.A., who
was jockeyed out of the Cambooya seat
some 14 years ago. Daniels has since
invented a potato-digger that bids well, and
has spent a number of years in Maoriland.
But to-day lie is back in Brisbane, reopening
his old Cambooya grievance. The fact that
some seven or eight Parliaments have since
intervened doesn’t trouble him.
When Colonel Holmes made terms with
the Germans in Papua, he agreed to pay
the Government officials three months’ full
salary if they didn’t shoot. This money,
along with some other allowances agreed
upon, has been paid out month by month
by the Commonwealth Government. To
give the devil his due, the German Govern-
ment hasn’t kept the Commonwealth waiting
for a refund. The whole lot' has already
come to hand, the United States Consul-
General acting as intermediary in the tran-
saction.
The other day, owing to the collapse of a
road, six .Maorilanders and their motor-car
fell 120 ft. down the Buller Gorge. The
clumsy member of the party acquired a
broken jaw and collar-bone. It doesn’t take
much to put some people out of action.
N. S. Wales Public Service Association has
duly decided, by ballot, to register as a
trades union, the voting being 650 for and
523 against. The Association has 4000
members, and there are 14,000 civil servants
in the State. Now, the 523 who voted in
the minority, and a lot of the 3000 members
who didn’t take the trouble to vote, and the
10,000 people who couldn’t be bothered to
join the Association are all howling together
about the iniquity of the thing. A threat is
made that if the registration is persisted in
a petition against it will be loaded up and
fired point blank, or even blanky. But see-
ing that the people who don’t join an asso-
ciation, and thus place themselves in a posi-
tion to vote on its proceedings, have no right
to raise objections to its acts, and that
those who had votes and didn’t use them
have only themselves to heap odium upon if
the decision hurts them, and that the quali-
fied folk who did vote placed themselves
under an obligation to accept the resolution
of the majority, the noble 650 are not view-
A scrap of biography:—
Peter of Servia (aged 70J years) must be a tired
old man these days. He is one of the Children of
the Klepht, as distinguished from the rival dynasty
of the Obrenovitches who were the Children of the
Pig-Dealer. He spent most of his life in exile in
very middling circumstances, and he could seldom
afford the front-room suite at the hotel. He married
an inexpensive sort of princess on the strength of his
expectations and his descent from Karageorgevitch,
the Klepht, who was murdered in an hotel by Obre-
novitch, the pig-dealing prince. He buried his wife
in exile, also his father ; and his children were born
in exile. When he was 59 years of age the throne
came , his way at last; but the joy of the
old man was mitigated by the recklessness
of his eldest son. Peter rules over a country
about one-tentli the size of New South Wales, and
with a population of about 4,500,000. He has had
three big wars on his hands inside three years.
When the latest war broke out he somehow scraped
up a few hundred thousand soldiers, and a few coppers
in cash. The Austrians bombarded his capital for
four months, and finally captured the ruins, and for
a while it seemed that the little kingdom was lost.
But Peter is resolved, above all things, that he won’t
become a cheap exile again. He did lofty stunts (as
the Yankees would say) in front of his army on a
horse that was probably borrowed, and which most
likely had to climb a tree for its food. The army
responded, and the Austrians got the surprise of
their lives, and fled out of the country. Then, as
something like 1,000,000 Servians were starving, and
there was no money left, Peter—according to report
-—cut down the palace expenses to £3 a week, and
there being probably no palace left the amount
might be sufficient. Now it is announced that Ger-
many has lent 400,000 troops for a fresh attack on
Servia; so, presi mably, Old Man Peter is bracing up
for a fresh effort And according to all the evidence,
Old Man Peter will win.

“ Yes, It Gives a Queenly
Complexion Quickly, Surely.”
TOILET TALKS.
THE average woman of to-day is usually
satisfied if her complexion is passably
pretty, little knowing that an exquisite skin
is now within her reach, providing she has
the good sense to stop using cheap made-up
preparations, and adopt what has now be-
come known as the mercolised wax habit.
It is a pity that every woman in the land
cannot be apprised of this simple method.
The few to whom its virtues are already
known have complexions that are the envy
of all their friends, and, as is usually the
case, the majority of them refuse to divulge
the secret. However, the formula has now
been verified, and is known as
mercolised wax. Enquiry at
several chemists’ shops has re-
sulted in ascertaining that this
substance has been known to
the select few for some years as
a complexion beautifier, but it
is only until quite recently that
it has been used to any extent
for this purpose. It was also
explained how mercolised wax
renews the complexion, but as
this is rather technical it is not
proposed to repeat it here. It
will be sufficient to say that
through some peculiar action the
wax absorbs the dead and dis-
colored outer cuticle, revealing the fresh
young complexion which every woman has
underneath. The process occupies about ten
days, and the change is so gradual and im-
perceptible that no discomfort whatever is
caused. The treatment is perfectly harm-
less. and the wax may be used as often as
desired.
what about that shampoo? Pre-
sumably like a good many others you
follow blindly in the beaten track, without
a moment’s thought as to where it will
eventually lead you. It is an impossibility
to expect the same make of shampoo to suit
each individual head of hair. In some cases
it would take out too much of the natural
oil, and in others not enough. Fair folks
require a milder shampoo than those with
dark tresses: therefore the logical course to
M
pursue is to make yoUr own shampoo and
graduate the strength according to the sus-
ceptibilities of your hair. The brush will
tell you whether you are treating the hair
properly. Like a plant in congenial soil the
hair will grow and flourish providing the
conditions are right; but abuse it as most
women do by washing it with some strong
alkaline solution and the effect is practically
the same as if you poured weed-killer over
growing plants. Before leaving the subject
I should like to mention that a few months
ago my local chemist recommended me to try
ordinary stallax in place of the usual made-
up powders, and I must say that
this substance, to my mind,
forms an ideal medium for the
purpose mentioned. If anything
it makes the hair rather too
fluffy and wavy, but some folks
prefer it so.
IT is astonishing the number
of women who suffer from
the humiliating affliction of
superfluous hair, and I am sorry
to say that through ignorance
or wrong treatment, the majority
of them have made matters con-
siderably worse by causing the
hairs to grow more quickly and
stronger than before. It ' only requires
a little thought to realise the folly
of it all. Removing the surface growth
for a few days may give temporary
relief, but in order to obtain per-
manent results the hair roots must be
killed. Caustic depilatories are worse than
useless, and on no account should the
hairs be pulled out. Apart from the
electric needle, which is a costly and pain-
ful process* any chemist will tell you
that the best home treatment is pure pow-
dered pheminol, which has a devitalising
effect upon the hair roots, in addition to
which it removes all trace of the objection-
able hair in a few seconds, q.nd the
recommended treatment gradually, but surely,
dissolves out the hair follicles, which
is the only method of permanently ridding
oneself of this terrible disfigurement. [?

Calabash : Don’t look too far ahead. When
the Australian manufacturer, by the aid of a patriotic
tariff, has learned to supply the Australian popula-
tion—which will probably number 50,000,000 by that
time, owing to the influx of artisans, also agricul-
turists and shopkeepers and others to supply these
artisans —and the foreign debt has been paid off,
and we have our own ships and our own sailors, and
there is a surplus of manufactured goods for export,
then we can begin to think of your problem. That
will be about 400 years hence. You and Mrs. Cala-
bash and the whole Calabash family will be dead
then. Do your duty to-day, Calabash, and set a
good example for next day. . . .Pilgarlic: Anybody
can write the tale of mystery until it gets to the
last chapter. Then you have to explain the secret,
and the difficulty comes in. Just start this way:
(1) The heroine is alone in a compartment of an
express train; (2) she dozes off for a moment; (3)
she wakes up, and finds a dead body upside-down in
her compartment; (4) she leaps from.the train, and
falls on a German military leper in a spiked helmet ;
(5) the train is never heard of again, and apparently
the universe has swallowed it up; (6) the heroine
gets home and finds that her cottage has vanished
in a day, and a palace has been built on her bit of
land; (7) she is arrested on a charge of bigamy.
That is a good first chapter, but how do you reveal
the secret in the last chapter ?.... The Chee-ild: Good
par. Sorry mostly covered by a recent contributor.
....Bumble B.: Write to the publications....

tation of the late O. Henry.” Doorkeeper (proffering
checks): “Coming back?” Everybody (wearily put-
ting on hats): “No, thanks!”... .E.M.S.: You fail

want. Close’ typing is horrible. Any contributor
who jams his lines together so that each page looks
like a large purple blot is regarded as an enemy.. . .

depressed.... F.C.C.: It takes a bright mind to dis-
cover an insult that hasn’t been hurled at William.

several times. < Don’t think you could tell us any-

The incurable Freetrader isn’t quite dead
yet. One “W. Buckingham” wrote in the
Sydney Telegraph (22/1/T5) as follows:
The present high cost of living is very largely
due to our Protective policy. We have determined,
in our wisdom and generosity, to send the foreigner
all our best goods in the shape of wool, wheat, hides,
tallow, dairy produce, frozen mutton, beef, copper,
silver, gold, and have determined to take nothing in
return. And for fear he should want to send us
some of his best goods in exchange we have put a
tariff barrier across our ports so that he shall not
be able to do so. All we are prepared to receive
from him . is a number of flat pieces of metal of a
circular shape and yellow color. Not that we have
only need of these pieces of metal, for we have
millions of them lying in our banks doing nothing.
Still, we are prepared to receive more of them in
order that we might put them into holes in the
ground under buildings set apart to receive them.
In addition, we are prepared to live on the worst of
' the things we produce, and if there are any things
we cannot make we are going to do without them.
Quite a number of people fancied that we
had gone into debt to the extent of well
over £300,000,000 through buying more goods
than we could pay for, and that we are still
borrowing because we buy more foreign
goods than we can pay for. But W. Buck-
ingham believes that we have vast surplus
wealth buried in holes in the ground. It
would be a great joy to Fisher and Holman
if Buckingham would show them even one
-of these, holes
LINES ON THE DEATH OF MY FAITHFUL DOG.
I was startled by a piteous wail
When I called her by her name,
And gently I spread a bag
Across her quivering frame ;
Her time was up, alas, poor brute
Her life I could not save
And within the shadow of a tree
I consigneed her to her grave.
. O’er the fatal exit of a dog
Tis folly for to mourn
Though by her death I realised
A deep affection gone.
....Satyr: Better hurry back to your grove....
M.C.W.: Low-spirited, uninteresting item.... Balkan
Sketcher: They don’t interest. What’s your name
and address?

Is a WONDERFUL NEW CAMERA with which you can take and instantaneously develop
pictures on paper, Post Cards and Tintypes. Every picture is developed without films or neg-
atives and is ready to deliver to your customer in a minute after making the exposure. THIS
REMARKABLE INVENTION takes 100 pictures an hour and pays you a profit of from 500
to 1,500 per cent. Everybody wants pictures and each sale you make advertises your business
and makes more sales for you. Simple instructions accompany each outfit and you can begin
to make money in a short time after the outfit reaches you.
WE TRUST YOU
SO MUCH CONFIDENCE HAVE WE in our proposition that we TRUST YOU for part
of the cost of the outfit. The regular selling price of the Camera and complete working outfit
is reasonable. The profits are so big, so quick, so sure that you could afford to pay the full
price if we asked you to do so. But we are so absolutely certain that you can make big money
from the start that we trust you for a substantial sum which you need not pay unless you clean
up £4O the first month. FAIR ENOUGH, ISN’T IT?

In moving the adoption of the Report the Chairman, Mr. George J. Cohen, said:—
The Directors have the pleasure to-day of presenting to you the Report and Balance-sheet of the
Company for the half-year ending the 31st December. . t)lp
Before moving their adoption I will explain the principal items and, as usual, compare me
figures, with those of twelve months ago. , .. , ... •, +h .-- j.
The total figures show an expansion of over half a million, and on the debit side tnis _
represented by balance of Capital paid up £23,000, Additions to Reserve Fund £lOO,OOO, and an
increase of £1,071,000 in our Deposits, while of the other items on that side our Notes in Circulation
have been reduced by £6770 for Notes presented and paid, and our Bills in Circulation are less j
£657,000. Profit and Loss shows slighty better. . . . ,
On the credit side of the Balance-sheet there are the following changes in our Liquid Assets.
Coin and Cash at Bankers is less by £85,000, while our holding of Australian Notes has increase

delay in the realisation of the Wool Clip and other Produce ordinarily largely dea

Started on Nose. Features Unrec
ognisable. Could Not Rest for
Itching and Burning. Used Cu-
ticura Remedies. No Return.
“Hayle,” Belmont Rd., Mosman, N.S.W.
—“A skin trouble first started on tlic side of
my nose and quickly spread over my face
and head, causing my face and head to
swell, making my features unrecognisable.
I cannot very well explain how I suffered,
but the pains were very severe, causing great
distress. I was unconscious for days: could
not rest day or night for pain, itching and
burning. The doctor pulled me through the
first attack all right, but it kept breaking out
on my face every few months, but not so
bad as the first attack. It would disfigure
me for days, so much that I would not let
anybody but our own family see me.
“Seeing the Cuticura advertisement in
the Herald I procured the Cuticurr, Reme-
dies. lam thankful to say I have not had
a return of it, and that is twenty odd years
ago. It brought it out of my body in per-
spiration. I would have to change my
clothes several times a day.’’ (Signed)
Miss Alice Denning, Aug. 5, 1912.
For red, rough, chapped and bleeding
hands, itching, burning palms, and painful
finger-ends with shapeless nails, a one-night
Cuticura treatment works wonders. Soak
hands, on retiring, in hot water and Cuticura
Soap. Dry, anoint with Cuticura Ointment
and wear soft bandages or old, loose gloves
during the night. Cuticura Soap and Oint-
ment are also indispensable for treating
pimples, blackheads and itching, scaly scalps
with dandruff. Cuticura Soap and Cuticura
Ointment are sold throughout the world.

AN/EMIA
and Debility
TF you are run-down, easily exhausted and out
* of breath—if you feel slack, depressed, or
“out-of-sorts,” start a Course of Iron
‘Jelloids’ at once. Iron ‘Jelloids ’ are the
finest and most reliable tonic for all cases of
Anaemia or Debility. They quickly restore
vitality, and produce the rich healthy blood so
essential to good health and vigour. Iron
‘Jelloids’ are a perfectly safe remedy under
all conditions —pleasant, inexpensive, do not
harm the teeth, and are non-constipating.
Dr. Andrew Wilson wrote:—
“It can be definitely stated that Iron ‘Jelloids*
constitute the most effective and desirable
treatment for the cure of that common com-
plaint, that insidious and weakening condition,
no matter from what cause arising, known
as Anaemia or Poorness of Blood.”
A fortnight's trial (Price 1/6) will convince you

“Bagman” describes the most prolific cow
on the N.S.W. North Coast: —
Concerning the threat of N.S.W. Minister for
t\ orks Griffith to abolish the free ferry on the Clar-
ence River, there’s room for his energy in another
direction. As a constant Coaster, it has always
struck me as a singular generosity that the Govern-
ment should expend about £9OOO annually to pro-
vide gratis tugs in the Northern River ports. Pass-
ing an ancient paddle steamer on the Ballina the
other day a coastal skipper told me that it was a
free State tug, for which the taxpayers were called
upon to find £l5O a year. (Incidentally, the relic
was too aged and feeble to tug anything.) Another
port pays £lOOO a year for a tug—which really does
tug. Once a fortnight she hauls a contraption which
looks like a sea-going tipdray, and, once a month, a
four-cornered ketch that would be better melted
down for cockroach oil. The cost works out at about
£2O a tow. In other river ports I’ve been in the
same sort of extravagance prevails. Ancient mariners
remember the day when the tugs were bought to
assist a large fleet of sailing craft which have been
wrecked or lost or mislaid long ago. Steamers now
do the business.

“Dipso”: I entered a . Darlinghurst pub
in search of a long draught lager.' I put
down 6d. The beer-queen pointed coldly to
a proclamation on the wall: —
By order of the Honorable the Attorney-General of
New South Wales for War Tax Saloon Bar drinks,
7d.
For the first time in my life I longed to
make a speech. I wanted to tell her that
N. S. Wales didn’t make war taxes any
more than Manly Beach. That the Attorney-
General doesn’t fix the prices of saloqn bar
drinks. That I had that very afternoon
bought a similar-sized beer in a George-
street saloon-bar for 6d. That I was being
taken down and knew it. All I did, how-
ever, was to pay the 7d. Why does one
never do anything else in such circum-
stances?
“Starboard”: The late Archibald Currie,
the old sea-dog who founded the Currie line
of steamships between India and Australia,
was the High Priest of Thrift, so he
was in his proper place as chairman of the
Savings Bank of Victoria. There is a story
about Captain Currie calling a chief steward
from one of his liners before him to order
that “in future ye mustna’ gi’e ja-am in
the fo’castle, as it’s gey dear, an’ isna’
guid for them.” At the Marine Board old
Archie Currie, who was never heard to smile
during his long and honorable career, had
occasion to reprimand a skipper who had
taken a passenger-ship too near a pier-head
one dark night and had harmed its figure-
head.. “Losh, mon,” fie said, “think wee!
ower yer conduc’. The sheep was worth a
quarter of a meelyun, the cairgo aboot
anither quarter meelyun, all good propputy,
every beet o’ it, an’, an’, besides, mon, there
were human lives in yer chairge.”
D’Arblay Burney, the Burgoyne Co.’s Aus-
tralian manager, gives a gloomy forecast of
the coming S. Aus. vintage. Last year the
State made close on 4,000.000ga15. This
time there will be barely 1,000,000 —not
even enough for the inter-State demand ; and
this just as Britain is refusing to touch the
German-grown light white wines, which S.A.
could so well supply instead. However, there
are good stocks in hand from the last two
big vintages. Burney gives ah excellent tes-
timonial to the improvement in cellar
methods in Australia generally, and, especi-
ally in view of the new prejudice in England
against everything connected with the Rhine,
feels “entirely optimistic regarding the future
of the great wine-producing industry of the
Commonwealth.”
Illawarra (N.S.W.) runs, as a side-line
to coal-mining, the harvesting of blackberries.
The womenfolk and children of the miners
are paid 10s. (id. a ctvt. (about a penny a
pound) for gathering the fruit, the bulk of
which goes to the jam factories. This year
it is expected that the crop will weigh 250
to 300 tons, and about £3OOO will be handed
round amongst the pickers. In Maoriland
the Westland mining community have a
pleasanter side-line-—catching whitebait. The
women and children do the catching, and get
7s. Gd. per kerosene-tin.

“P.H.”: A small type of mill, patented in
1893, and but lately introduced to Victoria,
promises to take the production of flour for
home consumption away from the big cen-
tral mills and restore it to the wheat-grow-
ing localities, thereby saving the growers
large sums in haulage and other charges.
The machine is of British invention and
make. One, costing £2200, was installed
about two years ago at Ensay, E. Gippsland,
by R. C. Edwards, late milling expert to the
Vic. Government, and has been in successful
operation since. This particular mill, which
is large of its kind, treats four bags of wheat
an hour. The flour is pronounced first-class
by the district bakers, and is all consumed
locally.

MAXIM SILENCER
For Attaching
to RIFLES.
wRMmMMmMM
Improves Your Marksmanship.
Ensures Noiseless Shooting.
The Marvel of the Shooting World.
HOW IT WORKS.
The Silencer checks the muzzle blast. Instead of the powder gases being liberated into the
air instantaneously when the bullet emerges from the muzzle, as in the ordinary gun, the gases
aie caugh t aJ b e y niad/to "whirl around inside the Silencer. This whirling forces the gas to fly
out from the centre by centrifugal force, leaving a central space, just the same as when water is
whirled around in a set bowl, a hole or space forms in the centre, this leaves the space for the
bullet to make its nassage. The gas cannot pass through this space until it slows down. 11ns
causes it to discharge into the atmosphere gradually. This absolutely prevents report noise and
also reduces recoil over two-thirds.
As the hole in the Silencer is much larger than the bullet the latter does not touch anything*
in passing* through, and consequently accuracy of flight is just the same whether the Silencer is oft
or on.
HOW MUCH IT REDUCES THE NOISE.
The Silencer absolutely annuls all the noise of the report as can easily be understood from
its construction It also'reduces the recoil over two-thirds. The reason for this is that there is
a. very strong tendency for the Silencer to be blown off the end of the gun. This tendency amounts
to a forward pull on the gun barrel. This forward pull counterbalances part of <-he backwaid kick
of the gun barrel. , . . , . , ,
The only noise the Silencer does not control is the noise made out in the air beyond ..he gun
by a high velocity bullet in its flight. This noise is a crack like the crack of a whip and not
a “whistle” or a “shriek” as is commonly supposed The noise is made in the wake of the
bullet, and is caused by the same thing that causes the air to crack when a whiplash is snapped.
The use of the MAXIM SILENCER has developed several heretofore
unknown facts regarding shooting. Knowledge of some of these facts will he
found to increase the pleasure of using the Silencer.

The War that Joseph Lost.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f HE cattle on a thousand hills
Were chewing up the dew,
Which night in careless bounty spills
Out of her apron blue —
Clear diamonds in the morning light,
Wet to the boots and cold to bite.
Remote, unfriended, somewhat slow,
I sat upon a stone
To view the melancholy show,
In which I was alone
Save for the company of three
Brown sparrows and an angry tree.
The tree was burnt and black and sore,
For war had passed that way,
With shot and shell, the day before
And blown lfis boughs astray.
And passing on, with footsteps red,
Had mostly bombed its own self dead.
So fierce a war it was indeed,
So bitter and unkind,
It made the whole wide landscape bleed,
And tore and rent the wind.
I knew it would have handled me
As roughly as it did the tree.
But I was in a little cave
Some distance up the hill,
Close hidden from the strong and brave,
Whose guns were meant to kill.
When wars come round I mostly try
Particularly not to die.
Of course, wars differ in their style,
For some are loud and grand,
While others wear a sort of smile
And eat out of the hand;
And one young war I used to meet
Was always chilly in the feet.
Some wars run up and down the world,
And smash and burn and shout;
And some are nicely oiled and curled,
And some are short and stout;
While some will burrow underground
And hide in dirt without a sound.
Some wars get shot when they are young,
And others live so long
That in the end they must be hung
(Or hanged, if that is wrong) ;
But every kind of war I know
Wants to become a picture show.
The war that passed me yesterday
Was of the swifter kind ;
I saw that it was young and gay
With features ill-defined ;
And yet it was a solid strife,
Largely composed of noise and knife.
At three o’clock it disappeared
Completely out of sight,
And when my manhood I upreared,
To see that all was right,
A tall old gentleman drew near
With whiskers fixed to either ear.
He asked if any wars had been
Around my place that day.
A small one that I might have seen
Had strangely gone astray.
He said that as it was a pet
It must not get its stockings wet.
He told me that his luck was out,
For all the wars he bred
Got mixed in an unholy rout
And every one was dead,
And this war cub that went so fast
Would absolutely be his last.
I told him where I saw the thing,
Describing how it walked.
And how the creature wore its sting,
And how it ate and talked.
“My war,” he cried, “beyond a doubt!
I’m sorry that I let it out.”
“It might come home again,” I said,
“If it is fond of you.”
But solemnly he shook his head
And mourned: “Mine never do.
I lose them all as safe as sin
Once the confounded shots begin.
“The last large war I owned,” he said,
“Is gone beyond recall.
A mob of Russians shot it dead
And ate it, guns and all.
I fear the brutal Servians fell
On the young war I love so well.
“Still, if it chance to call again,
Just try and catch the tiling.
Perhaps I may as well explain
I have a job as king.
Also as emperor. In fact.
I boss the whole large Austrian act.
“I let my two wars out to play
With three that Billy bred.
Such large, sleek creatures could not striy
Too great a length, he said.
‘Joe,’ he declared in accents loud,
‘Those wars of yours will do you proud.’
“Now Bill’s three wars are getting sick,
Though still they can be found,
Because he taught the things the trick
Of hiding in the ground,;
But rabbit wars, that burrow deep,
Are profitless affairs to keep.”
A tear fell from the monarch’s eye,
And down his whiskers white.
I said: “Now. Francis, do not crv.
It is a painful sight
When one whose second name is Joe
Lets his face corrugate with woe.”
He wept: “My little war is gone
And I shall never see
An infant warlet sitting on
Its young victorious knee;
Beside the Drina even now
Perhaps they drive it like a cow.”
What could I say, what could I do?
I sorrowed for his pain;
But that small war, as well I knew,
Would never smile again ;
And Bill’s own wars were out of blood
To wet their burrows in the mud.
The cattle on a thousand hills
Had sunny grass to eat.
Below were towns and docks and mills
And wine and corn and meat.
I promised if his war came near
To try and hold it by the ear.

GEORGE STREET.
’Tween Drinks.
A TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIAN
SCIENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DOCTORS of Divinity and doctors
of medicine are the king spielers
of creation.” Penfeather bit his
drink savagely. “The confidence man who
bustles a dolt from Cowyards out of 9d. in
copper and a brass pin is execrated by all
the best judges, but the parson who gives
you a spurious pass-in check to Paradise
for fifty guineas, or the Medical Gent, who
charges you a hundred for giving your indi-
gestion a Latin name, is an ornament and
a social joss whom no one dreams of hitting
in the neck with an axe.”
“ ‘For two things the earth is disquieted,’ ”
quoted Mackaboy, the barman, “ ‘For a ser-
vant when he reigneth, and a fool when he
is filled with meat.’ Proverbs, treble X. I
thought yon were going too gay with that
bowl of pickled cucumbers in the pub offer-
tory not an hour since.”
“What of it? At one time or another
I’ve paid the medical profession five or six
hundred to fit me up for the reception of
unusual nutriment, and how am I served bet-
ter than the chuckle-head from Cowyards
if the whole blessed system, apparatus, para-
phernalia and outfit breaks down in the
presence of two inches of mashed cucum-
ber ?”
“Many worthy physicians are instructing
us re the inadvisability of eating at meals,”
said Patrick thoughtfully.
Penfeather uttered a howl. “Ellen-
tommy ! I’ve tried it, but a man must eat,”
he said.
“That would appear to be a popular error.
But why persist in giving your repairs to
these scientific operatives whom you de-
spise? There are others —the faith-healers,
for instance.”
“A push of patent jack chumps. I’ve
tried them too. They ought to be in the
Asylum for Queer and Curious Sorts.”
“Not necessarily. If faith will move
mountains why shouldn’t it shift a brace of
bolted cucumbers? You tried to work won-
ders in a week. If I could not digest my
food any other way I’d give Christian science
a fair and open trial. This Mary Baker
Eddy wasn’t altogether wrong. I knew a
chap once who proved the efficacy of hard
and frequent thinking with a religious
basis.”
The barman squinted one-eyed through the
glass he had been polishing, and resumed his
light employment—not that the glass needed
it, but because gentle exercise seemed to
assist his peculiar process of recapitulation.
“The chap’s name was Strettle—-Victor
Strettle —of sufficient parentage but no par-
ticular position, and when I first knew him
his only sizable aspiration was to secure
the local championship for putting the
pewter. Before the itch for drink predo-
minated he had been a busybody with the
ladies, I believe, but he was only about 32
and still a presentable person.
“Victor Strettle concerned me little as a
nimble drinker, and there were no confidences
between us till that night when he came in,
and finding me alone called for a medium.
This was sufficiently unlike Victor to excite
remark. Previously nothing less than the
longest was Mr. Strettle’s measure.
“When I served the gentleman, and turned
my back to titivate the bottles on the shelves
(you’ve noticed how fastidious I am) I
caught sight of Victor as reflected in the
ornamental mirrors, pouring the black con-
tents of a small phial into his.
“I was just in time to prevent mishap.
1 foreclosed on Victor’s beer. ‘No. you don’t,
old son,’ I said, ‘not here and no\,.’
“He laughed quite pleasantly. ‘Why
not?’ he asked.
“ ‘Because I hate to have them die about
the house. It’s a nasty job sweeping them
out. And I loathe coroner’s juries.’
“ ‘So do I,’ Victor agreed. ‘They’re rotten
company for a hot afternoon. But this
time, your ready wit’s a bit too sudden on
the jump.’ He passed me the phial.
“The inscription was ‘Tincture of Bitter
Aloes.’ I slumped, as a mail is apt to do
who has mistaken a small farce for a con-
siderable tragedy. ‘lt’s a quaint taste in
refreshments you have,’ I said limply.
“Victor grinned again. ‘l’ll admit I don’t
care over much about this mixture con-
sidered as a drink,’ he said. ‘ln fact, I’m
taking it because I don’t like it.’ He took
a sip, and wrung a fearful face. Then he
look another sip. ‘You see,’ said he, ‘this
is the very last, and I don’t want it to leave
any pleasant memories. I want it to taste
so that there will be no melancholy regrets
when I think back on beer in the days to
come.’
“I admitted it was a new one, and that it
showed some gumption. ‘Why this sudden
high moral purpose?’ I asked.
“ ‘She’s fair,’ said Victor; ‘very fair, and
small, and slight, with quiet, grey eyes.’
“ ‘lndeed,’ said I, ‘then this is only a tem-
porary abatement. You’ll be back to try if
after all you have not done beer a grave
injustice when the fairness, the smallness,
slightness and greyness have begun to appear
quite usual attributes in a damsel.’
“ ‘Never. Take me or leave me, that girl
shall never think me a sot.’ Victor raised
his glass of beer and bitterness. ‘Here’s to
the clean life,’ he said.
“He drank the dose, rolling the last gulp
on his tongue to get the true inwardness of
it. Then he took a tiny piece of blue ribbon
from his pocket and stuck it in his hat.
‘Hers.’ he said. ‘I sniped it last night.’
“The removal of Victor’s hat revealed the
fact that Victor was bald. From his eye-

BACKACHE AND KIDNEY TROUBLE.
Two Sydney People Cured.
Mrs. E. Wilkinson, 29 Campbell Street. St.
Peter’s, Sydney, says : “For some time I suffered
agony from lumbago-like pains across the small of
my back. These pains prevented me from bending,
or getting proper rest at night, and seriously
hampered me when attending 'to my household
duties. Sometimes I was so bad I could hardly
move, and if I tried to get about the house the pain
was almost unbearable. After trying all sorts of
remedies without success, Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills were brought under my notice, so I got some,
and they did me good almost at once. After taking
two bottles of these pills I was ever so much better,
and eight bottles completely cured me. That was
12 months ago, and I have been well ever since. I
always keep a bottle of Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills in the house, and take a dose occasionally, and
they keep me in splendid health.”
Two years later Mrs. Wilkinson says : “I have
been free from backache since Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills cured me three years ago.”
Mr. W. H. Jeffries, King Street, Newtown.
Sydney, says: “About five years ago my kidneys
commenced to bother me, no doubt brought on from
hard work, such as lifting and bending over at my
work. My back was lame and aching, and this
handicapped me a lot, for it was a difficult matter
to stoop, and caused increased pain. I tried a good
many remedies, but they did me no good. A triend
advised me to take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
so I sent for some. I used them as directed, and
when I had taken about half a bottle I knew, they
were benefiting me. Thus encouraged, I continued
with the treatment until I was quite cured, and I
have not felt the slightest sign of backache since.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have made a different
man of me. and I recommend them to all who suffer
with backache.”
Five years later Mr. Jeffries says: * Doan s I>acK-
ache Kidney Pills cured me of backache five years
ago, and lam still free of this trying ailment. I
need say no more, my lasting cure speaks for itself.

made a difference. I judged it would weigh
with the small parcel with the grey eyes,
Trifles light as hair do weigh with women,
However, there was no reappearance of
Victor for eight weeks. Then I met him on
the stairs.
“ ‘Hello, hello,’ I said ; ‘awakening fond
recollections''’
' “ ‘No, Mackaboy,’ he replied, ‘and not
desirous ’
“ ‘But here you are in the hands of the

“ ‘lt would be a triumph but for one thing.’
He removed his hat, and. caressed his bald-
ness. ‘She is rather partial to hair.’
‘‘‘Of course you are doing something for
it ?’
“ ‘My dear fellow, every bald man has
done everything for it. No drowning man
clings to a straw more desperately than our
balding brother hangs on to his last liair.
Secretly, or in the open day, he tries every-
thing advertised. llis courageous efforts

lie said. You know all about Mary. She s
the wonderful American dame who estah-
fished the cult of Christian Science, and
demonstrated the efficacy of faith-healing.
Well, I’ve got on to the scheme. I’ve read
everything Mary has to say on the subject,
and although, curiously enough, that great
and good woman overlooked the possibilities
of Christian Science as a hair-restorer, no
honest, unprejudiced mind can fail to appre-
date the amazing power latent in faith and
the will, coupled with a strong religious cou-
viction. If faith will cure Bright’s disease,
and reproduce a fresh, sound, wholesome set
of kidneys, it will cure baldness and cause
a new growth of beautiful hair where all
was barren. But you must have a sure
belief, you must exert your will, and you
must give a certain time every day to
patient, sincere thinking. See.’ He re-
moved his hat, struck a match, and held the

“I looked into the matter. ‘Yes,’ I said.
‘A certain .visible, fluffy but diffident
growth.’

said triumphantly. ‘There’s nothing ill hut
thinking makes it so. There’s no one bald

Kress of my hair. Do you know she can
detect the effect of a good sermon ? And I
aai conscious of it myself. One excellent
discourse by the Rev. Thomas Long on
Absalom and Samson, with special inquiries
and reflections concerning the hair and
w hiskers of the saints, elders and prophets,
j found most exhilarating. On returning
bome x examined my hair, and it had grown
nearly a sixteenth of an inch. What do
you think of that?’
' “ ‘Marvellous !’ I admitted. ‘I am short
0 f two hack teeth. I must give the matter
some thought. Do you think a man could
will a new tooth on to a long-vacant site?’
“‘To be sure, he could. And now I come
to look at it, your nose is slightly deflected
to the left.’
“ ‘i’ll think it over.’ I said,
“That was the last long conversation I had

b'm. , . , . . , ,
"I was wondering how he contrived to pur-
sue his duties in an important department
a t Cumin and Tumbledon s when lie stepped
la to the bar, and over an invigorating glass
of sarsaparilla informed me that he had been
requested to resign', lie had for some time
been mixing up the literature of Gumm and
Tumbledon’s drygoods with curious reflec-
tions on Christian Science as a provocative
agent in abnormal liairgrowtlis. "So I’ve
left,’ he said. ‘lt \vould be a terrible pity to
allow mere sordid matters of business to in-
terfere with my great work. And it prospers,
The cause flourishes like a green bay tree.’
“He showed me his scalp again, and it
was covered with a dark, woolly down.
“ ‘She will be pleased,’ I said.
“ ‘Yes, she is delighted, dear girl. In six
months I shall probably have quite sufficient
hair to marry on, and as I have a little
money saved I purpose devoting my full
moral energy to the cause for some time.’
“After that, Victor gave himself up to the
business of willing, and slowly but surely the
hair came up. It was half an inch long,
black and thick, when he left. The hotel
was too expensive,, he said. He was going to
live in a small room and make his money
last as long as possible. The possibility of
having to interfere with bis noble experiment
in order to earn his daily bread inspired the
departure.
“I saw nothing of Victor Strettle for 12
months or more, and he had faded from my
mind. But one warm afternoon I came upon
a strange, snaggy object on a seat in Fitz-
roy Gardens. It had long, tangled hair hang-
ing to its shoulders, a voluptuous growth of
whiskers swept its chest, and wound tough
tendrils round its vest buttons. Its face was
thin and pale, and it had large, disconcerting
eyes with odd pupils. It was either a pro-
phet escaped out of the Book of Ahab or
Victor Strettle.
“I was fully employed for five minutes re-
viving his memory.
“ ‘Yes, yes,’ he said, ‘the Rev. Mr. Mack-
boy. I remember you. You see, I’ve done
it.’ He tossed his matted mane, he plunged
greedy talons into his indecent whiskers.
“ ‘You’ve done it, all right,’ I admitted.
‘Hair enough for a mattress factory. But
what of Kathleen?’
“ ‘Kathleen?’ he said in some bewilder-
ment.
“ ‘She was small, and fair, and slight, and
had quiet, grey eyes. You were to have wed
her, if you could grow hair enough.’
“ ‘Why, yes, of course,’ he said eagerly.
‘She was willing, but it wouldn’t do—it
would never do. I couldn’t think of it. You
see’—he dropped his voice to a whisper—‘l
couldn’t think of anything but my hair. If
I cease to think of it it will fall out. You’ll
excuse me, won’t you? But I mustn’t take
my mind off it for any length of time. A
man mustn’t lose hold of his hair. If he
does it comes out in clumps. When you’ve
willed it in you haven’t done ; you’ve got to
will it to stay in.’ He pulled a couple of
strands from his whiskers, looked at them
piteously, and began to whimper. ‘Dear me,
look what you’ve done—-look what you have
done, you wretched fellow !’ he wailed.
“He sank back in the seat, hunched up,
liis eyes closed, and so I left him snivelling
miserably.
“I know no more of Victor Strettle, but I
think it very likely that if you inquired at
Kew you would find a permanent boarder there
whose fond belief is that he has willed the
whole asylum so full of hair that it billows
out of all the windows and chimneys. There
are the elements of immortal fact in Chris-
tion Science, Penfeather. It cured Strettle.
But you must nersist with it. Remember,
rum was not made in a day.”

“And all der dime I hade der Kaiser —

I noticed a friend of mine signalling me,

that he wanted me to join him in a drink.
“But I’m not going to ask that darned
German.” he said. “A fellow ought not to
drink with you, speaking to a chap like that.
He’s a blanky spy ! All Germans are spies!”
I tried to explain that the Kaiser wasn’t
any sort of a real German, but I didn’t get
a hearing.

What a Young Lady
Says:
“I like Retnlngton-UMC arms and am-
munition because in this age women should
know how to shoot as well as men. I
do not see why women should not indulge
in one of the world’s most popular sports;
nor do I see why we should be compelled
to face danger without, if necessary, defending our-
selves and our homes. Pe/ningto/IrUMC arms
are well made and just suit me because they can be
easily taken apart for cleaning or carrying and the
cartridges have always given perfect satisfaction;
besides they can be procured from any dealer.

fts ft Digestive Medicine
there is no proprietary preparation which has achieved such an enormous success
as Beecham’s Pills. And it is worthy of note that their remarkable popularity
is not confined to one class of people nor to one country—their splendid reputation
is World-Wide, The explanation of this extraordinary success lies in the fact that
Beecham ? s Pills always do good. They are specially prepared for dealing with
disorders of the digestive organs, and the relief they afford is both speedy and
sure. Whether the trouble is due to sluggish liver and constipation or an
enfeebled state of the stomach, an intelligent use of
Beecham’s pills
will soon correct the faulty conditions. By gently eliminating all unhealthy
accumulations, and stimulating the stomach to normal efficiency great im-
provement in the general health is quickly brought about. The appetite
improves—discomfort after meals disappears and there is no more flatulence or
biliousness. A box of Beecham’s Pills is an excellent investment. It pays to
take them. A trial is all that is necessary to convince anyone that as a cure for,
and safeguard against, digestive ailments. BeechanTs Pills
Are Second To JVone.
Sold everywhere in boxes, price 1/1J (56 pills) & 2/9 (168 pills).
