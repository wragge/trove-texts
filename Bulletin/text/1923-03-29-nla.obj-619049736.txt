The Red Page
Polynesian Argonauts
In 1914 Bromislaw Malinowski, a Polish
scientist who had attracted notice by his
work on "The Family Among the Australian
Aborigines,” came to Australia to attend
the British Association for the Advance-
. ment of Science. When the outbreak of
war scattered that eminent collection of
brains, Malinowski found his attention wan-
der from the contemplation of European
savagery to the milder methods of the
Papuan heathen. His friend and teacher,
Dr. Seligmann, author of the "Melanesians
yf British New Cuinea,” had awakened his
interest in the daring navigators of the
eastern archipelago of Papua, of whom, in
spite of their journeyings, little was known
ethnologically. A two years’ residence in
the Trobriands gave him the material for
Argonauts of the Western Pacific (Rout-
ledge).
To the average white inhabitant of Papua
the Trobriands are notorious for the giddi-
ness of the Trobriand ladies, and for the
islanders’ skill in growing yams and in wood
carving. Their three great clans are ruled
by hereditary chiefs, powerful eveji now, and
held in awe. They are also divers for, and
sellers of, a sea-mussel pearl; they are notori-
ous magicians; they are traders and travel-
lers of considerable reputation. Their trad-
ing system Dr. Malinowski is the first to
methodically describe in print. Indeed, his
book is almost entirely devoted to the de-
tails of the kola, with all its mysterious
ramifications and magical concomitants.
Magic, black and white, so wraps about
every transaction that even those well used
to the Papuan mainlanders’ reliance on sor-
cery are forced to wonder. In witchcraft
they possess a special line of their own —the
Mulukwausi, or aerial witches. These ladies,
whose office is hereditary, descending from
mother to daughter, can flv through the air.
They are the authors of storms and wrecks,
which gives them an important standing in
the eyes" of a seagoing people. They also
devour the bodies of the dead, to whom they
flock like invisible vultures. Every death-
bed and funeral is a terror to the living, who
know that about them hover the hungry
witches, unseen indeed, but making their
presence felt in a hundred hair-raising
ways. Their most unpleasant trick, how-
ever, is the abstraction of the entire “in-
side” of a victim. This is hidden away for
future consuni"tion, and unless another
witch can be hired to find the treasure the
original owner, as one might expect, is
doomed.
The kula, which claims most of the author’s
attention, is a curious and involved system
of exchange between groups or individuals
inhabiting what Malinowski calls “the Kula
Ring.”. Starting from the eastern end of
the Papuan mainland, this ring runs to
East Cape, through Dobu, the Amphletts and
the Trpbriands. Then it turns westward
through the Marshall-Bennett group, Wood-
lark Island and the Loughlins, thence, south-
east again, by Misima, Tube Tube and Wlari,
to the starting-point. The articles ex-
changed are two only—the soulava, or neck-
laces of cut red shell; and the mwali, or
white arm-shells cut from the trochus shell,
and known in Motu as toi-ia. There is no
question of profit about these exchanges.
Each article is only in the temporary posses-
sion of the last recipient. The time will
come when he will have to pass it on to his
kula partner, living in some other island
group within the kula ring. The two articles
travel always in opposite directions. The
soulava's route follows the clock’s hands;
that of the mwali goes in the opposite direc-
tion. Never may either be reversed. Only
a limited number of men in each island or
village take part in the kula. Every man
in the kula periodically receives a gift of
soulava or mwali, and later hands it on to a
kula partner elsewhere, receiving in ex-
change, then or later, an equivalent of the
other commodity. This sort of thing goes
on continually, and the exchanges give
birth to the great expeditions of sailing
canoes, from one island group in the “ring”
to another, which suggested the title of the
book. ■>
The circulation of the vaygu'a, the “valu-
ables,” has no fixed periods. As a rule, a
vaygu'a is not kept more than a year. The
articles are rarely used by the temporary
owners. Their possession is a source of
pride to. a community, and they are lent for
exhibition on occasions of great ceremony,
as a European may lend a world-famous
picture or a vase to an exhibition. Excep-
tionally fine specimens have their names
arid histories, gathered during their inter-
minable journeyings. But though the kula
itself is not merchandise, there has grown
up, subsidiary to the kula itself, a great
inter-island trade in foodstuffs, weapons,
tools and manufactures.
Dr. Malinowski gives detailed accounts
of the hundreds of different “magics” that
attach, not only to the kula expeditions and
observances, but to almost every s*ct of Tro-
briand existence. A hwaga’u, an estab-
lished specialist in black magic, enjoys an
income that would turn many a Macquarie-
street specialist green with envy. He draws
his money both ways; he is called in by one
side to make the trouble and by the other
t 5 take it off. He is employed to make safe
or to wreck expeditions, to bless the kula
journey, to increase the yield of the gardens,
to destroy an enemy or to ensure a lady an
ardent lover.
The work, beautifully illustrated by photo-
graphs. well indexed and supplied with
explanatory maps, is a notable contribution
to the literature of Papuan ethnology. As
far as first-hand information goes, it is
superior even to Dr. Seligmann’s standard
. work.

Can’t We Let Shakspeare Alone?
What I notice most about these newly-
enlightened informants regarding Shak-
speare is their positiveness. They know
that the person credited with the authorship
of “Hamlet” was illiterate, that his daugh-
ter signed documents with a cross, that he
was “a money-lender with whom Ben Jon-
son w'ould never have dreamed of associat-
ing,” that no parts of. the “fragmentary
story” of the alleged dramatist are authen-
tic save those that suggest he was an im-
postor. Is the Shakspeare tradition to be
judged only by present-day allegations: Are
people who accepted the Stratford poet as a
fact in the 17th century, when his old con-
temporaries were still living, and echoes or
suspicion about the “impostor” (had he
been an impostor) could not have died away
—are these people to be regarded as dupes
of a lie which must have beeii known or sus-
pected by scores of persons?
No man was better posted in the town
gossip of his time than Samuel Pepys.
Samuel, in his diary of July 7, 1664, forty-
eight years after the death of Shakspeare,
wrote that on his way home from the office
he called for some new books, including
"Shakspeare’s Plays.” The Vicar of Strat-
ford, the Rev. John Ward, left a diary,
dating from only 32 years after the drama-
tist’s death, which indicates that lie (Ward)
probably was alive at the time of the. de-
cease, and must certainly have been inti-
mately acquainted with persons who
attended the funeral. And the Rev. John
Ward wrote :—•
I have heard that Mr. S. was a natural wit, with'
out any art at all; he frequented the plays all his
younger time, but in his elder days lived at Stratford,
and supplied the stage with two plays a year ; and
for it had an allowance so large that he spent at the
rate of a thousand a year, as I have heard. Shak-
speare, Drayton and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting ;
and, it seems, drank too hard, for S. died of a fever
there contracted.
Are these proofs that Shakspeare was
Shakspeare—-proofs offered within 50 years
of his death —to count as nothing against
the 20th century allegation that he was all
the time a nobleman in disguise?
The note in the Vicar of Stratford’s diary
is consistent with a tradition handed down
to Alexander Pope and Dr. Johnson,, viz.,
that Shakspeare’s first connection with a
playhouse, when he fled to London to escape
criminal prosecution, was as holder of horses
for playgoers who kept no grooms, and that
his business capacity was so great that he
soon had a number of boy horse-holders
working for him. These old stories of the
man from Stratford evidently carried some
evidence of his genuineness two centuries
ago, when Pope, the literary authority, re-
peated them. Shakspeare, “the natural-
wit, without any art at all,” had been dead
seven years when a monument was erected
to him in Stratford Church, and an engrav-
ing of the poet was done by Martin Droe-
shout. Of which Ben Jonson courteously
wrote: —
This figure that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakspeare cut.
O, could he but have drawn his wit
As well in brass as he has hit
His face, the print would then surpass
All that was ever writ in brass.
The Bard was 14 years dead when Milton,
a young university man of 21, wrote the son-
net re “Sweetest Shakspeare, Fancy’s child,”
and asked: —
What needs my Shakspeare for his honored bones
The labor of an age in piled stones ?.
Shakspeare’s daughter Susanna died 30 or
40 years after her father. On her tomb-
stone are the lines: —
Witty above her sexe, but that’s not all;
Wise to- salvation was good Mistress Hall.
Something of Shakspeare was in that; but this,
Wholly of him with whom she’s now in bliss.
You see, the Stratford poet’s wit was re-
corded on his daughter’s tombstone. Her
husband didn’t think of father-in-law as an
impostor strutting in borrowed feathers.
Until the belated discovery of Edward de
Vere nobody had thought of anyone save
Francis Bacon as the author, or part author,
of plays registered under the name of the
Immortal. The Bacon theory no longer wor-
ries me. I think I perceive the facts of
the case in certain notes allegedly made by
Bacon on the margins of books. If the
assumptions of their authenticity be correct,
it is certain that Bacon took a pretty keen
interest in Shakspeare’s playwriting, and
gave him suggestions for plots. And if we
assume that Bacon did sometimes go so far
as to give friend William the draft of an
unfinished play, and ask him to put in some
comedy scenes, and good telling situations
—well, what then? What sort of share was
Bacon likely to have in the work when the
literary genius had finished with it? The
joint productions of Divine William and
Francis Bacon (if they ever worked to-
gether) were an even more unequal collabo-
ration, I take it, than that of Jones and
Herman in the authorship of “Silver King.”
Anyhow, the splendidly absurd incongruities
in such plays as “As You Like It,” where
you have Shakspeare’s literary quality at its
very best, are proofs that no careful Bacon
or travelled Edward de Vere could possibly
have had a finger in the story. Proofs in-
direct of Shakspeare’s genuineness bristle
from his tragedies and comedies. He was
the born genius who wrote immortal lines,
and whole scenes, into his plays while they
were being rehearsed. His education, more
scholastic than that of Charles Dickens,
sufficed for his wonderful talent, although it
would have been a poor equipment for Bacon
or De Vere to struggle along with. He
was just a genius, accepted by his compeers
at only a little less than posterity’s valua-
tion, but himself unconscious of his remark-
able talent for putting himself in his charac-
ters’ places.

Art and Artfulness
The Australian public has for so long been
duped on the subject of art that a few words
on the artfulness of art may meet with a
lack of appreciation in certain quarters, and
be, therefore, worth writing.
The average artist embarks upon his life
work because he is possessed of the crea-
tive faculty. Normally this results in
marriage and other things, but in the case
of the artist, circumstances have directed it
into artistic channels. For the purposes
of clarity let the creative faculty be defined
as a driving force compelling the expression
of an individual conception of life. In the
case of the artist the medium is limited to
the sense of sight. In many instances he sub-
merges his true creative faculty with one

Studebaker announced as its slogan for 1921, “This is a
I/js Studebaker Year,” there must have been many people who doubted
the possibility of the aim expressed by the slogan being achieved,
for 1921 threatened to be a bad year for the industry—and was.
The output of the industry fell off J+s per cent. To hold its place
Studebaker should have done the same, but, instead of that, sales not only
did not fall off, but actually increased by ISO per cent, over 1920. Such
things don’t happen accidentally. The facts are that after the war Studebaker
spent an extra £5,000,000 in manufacturing plants, and re-designed its cars
to meet the composite requirements of 6500 Studebaker dealers throughout
the world.
Despite this, Studebaker has not been able to catch up with the demand.
In the first seven months of 1922 the record figures of 1921 were passed,
and by the end of December the 1921 total had been beaten 65 per cent.
The factories were many thousand cars behind orders. Production capacity
for 1923 has been increased to try to keep abreast of the demand of a world
greedy for Studebakers.
Back of such Results there must be a powerful Cause. A great deal might
be written in general terms of satisfaction—service, and so on, but perhaps
the real reason can best be revealed by an official statement issued by the
president of the Studebaker Corporation of America, Mr. A. R. Erskine: —
“Our sales of repair parts in 1921 were 12 per cent, less than they were
in 1919, notwithstanding that 118,000 new cars were sold and put in operation
in 1920 and 1921. Based on the total estimated number of Studebaker cars
in operation in 1921, ive sold §16,00 worth, of parts per car for repairs from
all causes, including accidents.”
See the Exhibit at
Stand No.
21
Also the wonderful
Talking Studehaker at the
salesrooms,
17: Elizabeth Street,
Sydney
Such figures prove conclusively that Studebaker cars are standing up
in service and keeping out of repair shops to a most remarkable degree.
They are indicative of the experience of hundreds of thousands of
Studebaker owners, and is the real reason why the demand has become so
insistent, that Studebaker is finding it difficult to keep with it.
The Studebaker line is such as to fill every need and fit every purse.
There is the Light Six, the chassis weighing 18001 b., with an engine of
inches bore by inches stroke, selling at from £555. It is as loiv priced as any
Four, quite as economical and a much sweeter car to drive.
The Special Six fills the requirements of the man who wants greater
power, and with it Studebaker silence and economy. The engine is inches
by 5, and the weight of the chassis 2500 Tb. The cost is from £555.
The Big Six is the Master Car for the man who is not satisfied with any-
thing less than ALL the Luxury of Motoring. It is replete with refinements.
It has a wheel base of 126 inches, and carries a magnificently appointed body,
which has numerous finishing touches exclusive to Studebaker. The price is
£695 for the luxurious 1-sealer.
The demand which makes Studebaker the greatest selling six-cylinder car
in the world is world-wide. It is a progressively increasing demand, as shown
by the marvellous advances made during a period generally regarded as bad
for the industry. It makes certain the knowledge that C 1923 will be a greater
Studebaker year.”

utterly artificial. At the outset he realises
that to fully express himself he must first
attain mastery of the means. Having done
this, too often he rests content, in this way
losing the end in the means. Subconsciously
realising that something is lacking in his
work, he rationalises in a remarkable man-
ner, dubbing certain .mannerisms he has
accidentally acquired individuality—in short,
the complete expression of his creative
faculty. It is in this way that the public
is duped by half-made artists; in this
way artfulness displaces art: ,
Australian artists fall into two classes.
First, there is the artist who: has deserted
his country in its (and his own) hour of
need. Secondly, there is he who, lacking
either the initiative or the wherewithal to
break with the land which refuses to feed
him, remains to build up a market for art
good enough to induce those who have* pre-
viously left to repatriate themselves.
Frankly, what has been the history of the
majority of those who have become English-
men? The fact that they have left Australia
indicates two things: (a) that they wish to
broaden their art; (b) that they wish to
make money. The two elements are present
in varying proportions. Experience has
shown that in many cases the desire to
broaden their art has meant the acquiring
of a slickness of technique, of a getting
into the groove that is the predominating
feature of most of the English artists. In
short, the money-making ideas have sub-
merged the artistic ideals. “He comes back
a very good business man, and a very bad
painter.” These words were spoken of one
of our most “successful” men by one who
better than anyone else here should be con-
ceded the right to judge. Moreover, a com-
munication written in the “prime” of an
Australian artist abroad seemed to measure
the success of his art by the fact that he
never asked less than so many guineas for
the least of his works.
There is not the slightest doubt that sooner
or later in this article the inevitable will
come. So let the horn bray and all the rest
of it. When the strains of “God Save” ring
out, good citizens who move in the best
circles immediately present their naked pates
to ceiling or sky, and thus await the dog-
gerel’s end. In (lie same way good citizens
“dip their lids,” and stand in awed silenee
in the presence of the evidence of that other
George—George Lambert, A.R.A.
There are times when I regret the Armis-
tice, when I pray with all the sincerity of a
recruiting minister of the Gospel of Good-
will that the Treaty of Versailles may pro-
duce another war, in which sufficient scope
may be given me to tackle single-handled
indefinite scores of whoever it may be the
diplomatists decree we must face in the next
war. Times and moods there be when I feel
equal to frankly discussing Australia’s
greatest painter with one of his own wor-
shippers, or even with himself.
Yes. With the intent of finding him, I
Avould nose around every “quartier” smelling
even the least bit like Bohemia, and finally
run across him. I would ask him whether
he remembered me in the mess in Palestine.
Probably he wouldn’t. As a matter of fact
I was never there. I would recall to his
mind one or two horse-riding incidents con-
nected with the Unholy Land, and in this
manner we might put ourselves at our ease.
I would compliment him on his wonderful
draughtsmanship, his sense of color —I would
not overdo it by mentioning atmosphere—
and his general thoroughness; real, good,
solid jobs, I would say. I believe this would
please him. Then I might take a whisky and
soda, perhaps two. maybe a third without
the soda. I might then mention the latest
experiments in color photography. Another
whisky, and I might suggest that at some
time in the not very distant future color
photography may reach the pitch of artful-
ness that his art has attained; possibly
lacking in mannerisms, possibly just missing
that sense of complete conviction, possibly
not stilted, possibly perfectly natural. Yet
might not even these apparently mcomp.at-
ible differences between photography and
art be adjusted by a little retouching—by
the toning down of an eyebrow to produce
an artistic if altogether untrue simplicity
of tone, by the distortion of a hand, by the
elongation of toes and the accentuation of
the knuckles? At this point fear would un-
doubtedly possess me, and, rushing headlong
out into the street, I would meet a well-
deserved end at the toe of a passing tin-lizzy.
Really, though, it is a serious matter.
When you come to consider it, Avhat, after
all, is our greatest painter hut our greatest
art-photographer? Mannerisms? Eccentric
poses? Knuckled fingers? Purple-striped
pyjamas? We are told that such things are
evidences of individuality. Against this
contemptible charge we would defend our
greatest artist with our latest breath.
Is his personality, his individuality, so
trifling, so merely exhibition ary, that
he has to resort to such trickeries to
raise his art above art-nhotographv? No! A
thousand times no ! We feel, we hope, we
pray that some day Lambert Avill admit to
the Avorld at large that, after all, he reaFy
is an Australian, perfectly and satisfyinglv
natural. In that day Ave Avill cease to talk
color-photography at his expense, and spon-
taneously take off our hats to a great artist.
The case of Lambert has been dealt with
at some length, not for petty reasons, hut
because he is generally accented tmth by artists
and connoisseurs <as having Reached the
heights which students should strive to at-
tain. And in a way he has. For he has
mastered, almost completely, his means. But
in the name of everything Australian, let
us have done with trumperies about indi-
viduality and the like. Personality, individu-
ality—let us have them. They are elements
lacking which art would cease to be art. But
let them ring true, cleansed of stilted ration-
alisations.
A conception of the highest art may best
be arrived at by a study of the Avorld’s
greatest art, At the outset of such a study,
the work of the Greeks -and the-mas-t'enveces
of Michelangelcpclaim pre-eminence; and for
the reason that in each case admirable mas-
tery of means is combined with an untram-
melled play of the creative faculty. The
Greeks aimed at something more than the
matter-of-fact representation of form as it
existed. They strove to produce, to c”eate,
the nerfect form In the same way, Michel-
angelo’s technique formed a perfectly-
balanced complement to his power of creation.
In more recent times artists appear to hseve
been torn betivixt tAvo opinions. Those aim-
ing at creative work have allowed their
technique to become indifferent. 'Thus their
ideal has become the subject of ridicule in
the hands of those artists Who aim at, and
largely achieve, material perfection. And
the creati\ r e artists have found it hard to
retaliate, for materialism is a difficult thing
to ridicule.
What of the future of Australian art? Can
we, in Australia, produce a national type
or school of art? At the risk of appearing
cynical, I say, why not? The Greeks did it.
Why not Ave? Or shall our art, like that of
Michelangelo, be a matter individualistic,
the message of a man to the teeming mil-
lions of the Avorld, and the teeming millions
yet to be born—not merely a cry in the wil-
derness of our baby land? These, as all
things, the future will decide.
JOHN COY.
What Should We Write About?
S. Talbot Smith concludes an article (R.P.
15/3/'23) with a sentiment which will
startle many Australians: —
England is hardly ready yet to admit that we
have any social or city life at all approximating
to its own. It wants, if anything, the Busk or
Islands yarn —G. B. Lancaster, Beatrice Grinvnaw,
Albert Dorrington, Ralph Stock. For the present,
seemingly, it will value Australian stories in direct
proportion to their remoteness from anything London
has to show. And things are better so. tar more
desirable is a good unmistakable kangaroo than
a dingo masquerading as a British foxhound.
I am not quite clear as to whether the dingo
in Mr. Smith’s trope is the Australian
writer who deals with city life, or the society
with which he deals; or whether the animal
symbolises both the writer and his medium.
But this, anyhow, is clear: because England
hasn’t yet shown enthusiasm for books about
Australian social or city life (and four-
fifths of Australia’s social life is lived in
cities, more’s the pity!) Australian writers
should, in Mr. Smith’s opinion, coniine them-
selves to adventure yarns. From that pro-
position I take leave to differ.
There are, broadly, two sorts of books
that are written in English about eity-
dwellers —the so-called “society” novel, and
the others. God forbid that anyone, should
write about Australian “society,” unless with
his tongue in his cheek! An Australian
Mrs.; Humphry Ward, for example, would
be an intolerable affliction. But a local
novelist who approached our “society” in the
right spirit—in the spirit, say, of the author
of “Babbit” —would do the nation a service,
provided he had anything like Sinclair Lewis’s
gifts. The “society” life of our great cities
is very much the same as that of Zenith
City. At the top we have the aloof financial
magnate; a little lower down is the type
With a liking for what Mr, Babbit would
call the “bright lights” (some of our papers
refer to him as “a member of the smart
set”) ; still lower is the financial failure,
and below him other failures. All these
people, in Zenith as here, have probably been
to school and a university together; they
speak alike and think alike, and their level
of culture is equally low. They are differen-
tiated, one from the other, by nothing but
the amount of money they possess. Always
provided they are taken, not at their own
valuation as intellectuals or hedonists, or
both, but at a world-valuation (which was
the valuation Lewis applied to Mr. Babbit
and his friends), they should well repay,
study. But most social novels of worth have
not been written about the little section
which in every village and town and city
likes to be known as “society.” Consider
Dickens’s portrait-gallery of masterpieces—
Tapley, Nicholas Nickleby, Mrs. Gamp,
Pecksniff, Bleep, Sikes, Pickwick, the Wel-
lers, Gradgrind, Jingle and a hundred more.
Every one of them belonged either to the
middle class or to a humbler one. Even
Thackeray, who is sometimes sneered at as
a “society” chronicler and hence a snob, was
most successful with his middle-class charac-
ters —Becky Sharp, Amelia, Dobbin, Jos
Sedley, Pendennis, the Newcomes and their
legal, commercial, military and Anglo-Indian
friends. About four-fifths of Thackeray’s
characters may be a point or two north of
the middle-class line (just as four-fifths of
Dickens’s are definitely south of it) ; but as
England understands the term they are
middle-class people just the same. Now
take some modern masters. (Meredith and
Hardy are excluded from the list, because
both wrote largely of the country—and here,
incidentally, “Tess’ may be said to cancel
“The Egoist.” For every English classic,
from the author of “Tom Jones” onwards,
who deals with “society” in the country it
is possible to quote two who don’t.) George
Gissing wrote a whole library of absorbing
studies of the folks who live in London
suburbs like Ivennington. All Wells’s best
social novels have been about neople of the
class of Mr. Polly. If Arnold Bennett lives
it will be by his studies of the Five Towns
and not by such books as “The Pretty Lady,”
into which unconvincing women of fashion
intrude. And so one might go on for a
column or more.
The points I wish to make are: (1) If
our writers are so foolish as to confine them-
selves to adventure yarns of the tyne cited
by Mr. Talbot Smith, there can be little or
no financial, or other, hope for them, if only
for the reason that 99 per cent, of them have
had no adventures and are not likely to
have any; and (2) we have ample material
here for novels dealing with our social l'fe
—material which, if competently handled, in
the first instance is sure, anyhow, of a local
sale at a good price. A fact to which both
Gilbert Franknu and Somerset Maugham
drew my attention when they were here (the
former before the war, and the latter after
it) was that Australians are profoundly self-
conscious, and are longing to have them-
selves interpreted by someone, anyone, so
long as he or she will do it in a reasonably
convincing fashion—and that our papers are
coming to realise this truth is proved by the
way they are snapping up Australian serials.
But obviously if the local novelist Avants to
interest Australians he must do his inter-
preting where most of them live, and (quite
as important) where he lives himself—not,
that is to say. in a Parnmn jungle or on an
out-back cattle-run. Whether such works
will ever sell in London must depend on their
merit. I am optimistic enough about, the
taste of the possessors of the world’s great-
est literature to believe that any book which
is good is bound eventually to interest them;
though the tusk ,04 convincing British readers
that Melbourne or Sydney is just as interest-
ing as Zenith may take time. The objection
to Mr. Talbot Smith’s suggestion that we
should go on being literary dingoes, and noj
write about the only life we really know
lest we be accused of aping English fox-
hounds. is that the thing simply isn’t busi-
ness. Humility is a virtue that may be over-
done.
J. B. D.
The Art of Katherine Mansfield
Two unpretentious volumes of short tales,
written in two years, form but slight foun-
dation for a comparison with the art of
Tchekhov, Thomas Hardy and De Maupas-
sant. Yet the comparison has been made
by some of the most scholarly pens in Eng-
land. In achieving this Katherine Mans-
field, the Maorilander-born, who died in
France a month or two ago, had accom-
plished no mean tiling, and her early death
is no less than a tragedy.
When her first volume of stories, “Bliss,”
appeared in 1920, the English critics were
puzzled to define her art. Had she an art?
She could not be classified. She was not
a naturalist, nor a romantic, nor a senti-
mentalist; while, to class her as an impres-
sionist pure and simple did not do justice
to her simple, clear style. The only thing
to do was to call it “queer” and pass on.
Some obviously felt that she was not fair
to her readers. Undoubtedly, she left them
to apply the spark to the train of powder
that she had laid. Edward Shanks, writing
in London Mercury, observed :—■
Miss Mansfield’s art is, in all these stories, an art
of elimination. Nearly all of them concentrate on
a moment, on a single momentary situation... .to
this end she strips her. tales of the smallest scrap
of detail which does not hear on the central point;
and it is, indeed, impossible to admire too much
the skill, the uncanny sleight of hand with which
she ddes this. For these stories do not usually, as
such slender pieces of work can, open windows on
things that are really significant.
Perhaps not; but the lives of Miss Mans-
field’s faded spinsters and second-rate souls
are quite as important to them as their own
are to princes and prime donne. The critic of
the Times showed himself more just when
he wrote: “Every touch in these stories
shows the author’s sensitiveness to the
beauty of sound, color and scent... .She sees
her people with the steady eyes of some
Hardyan spirit, which yet is neither ironic
nor indeed pitiful.”
The tale after which the first book was
named, “Bliss.” was the high-water mark
of Miss Mansfield’s achievement. It depicts
a wife, terribly sensitive to external things,
in a rising glow of happiness at the delights
of the world. Her joy is caught and crys-
tallised in the symbol of a pear-tree which
blooms in her garden. At. the flood-tide of
her happiness she finds that her husband is
the lover of her friend. And her ecstasy
freezes, becoming as beautiful and as impo-
tent as the pear-tree itself. Under the whip
of such an emotion, she can write thus: —
At the far end, against the wall, there was a tall,
slender pear-tree in fullest, richest b100m... .It stood
perfect, as though becalmed against the jade-green
sky....and the two women stood side by side....
looking at the slender, flowering tree. Although it
was so still, it seemed, like the flame of a candle,
to stretch up, to point, to quiver in the bright air,
to grow taller and taller as they gazed—almost to
touch the rim of the round silver moon.
This is the crystallisation of pure emotion,
which is always a rare thing.
Another notable little tale, to which the
reader must supply his own key, is Psy-
chology,” wherein two normal people, who
move upon the level of artistic fellowship
and understanding, tremble on the brink qf
an emotion that would wreck their friend-
ship. The tumult rises and passes practi-
cally while they talk casually over an after-
noon tea-table. There are one or two little
genre portraits, obviously exercises in the
French school, which are merely interesting
because they show the rigid technical train-
ing by which this apparently styleless style
is achieved. But they are a far cry from
the finished article in this vein, _ such as
“Pictures,” from which the comparison with
De Maupassant,!® probably derived. “Pictures ’
is one of the harshest studies that can be
imagined, unrelieved by any spiritual re-
actions whatever. A woman falls from
grace because of her sheer inability to earn
an honest living and because hunger and
irate landladies prove too much for her. One
can feel the deliberate veil that Ada Moss,
in her extremity, draws over undisciplined
thought. In “Mr. Reginald Peacock’s Day”
Miss Mansfield showed herself a merciless
surgeon upon second-rate mentality. She
holds up to scorn the obliquity of such a
mind, and yet sees the vein of beauty and
of appreciation of decent things among so
much bad ore. The music-master, with his
mental poses, is one of her happiest stud'es.
Her second book, “The Garden Party,”
denotes no great progress, but hints at an
increased clarity of style and a greater dis-
tinction of character-drawing. “The Garden
Party” itself has this quality. It is more
obvious, therefore less attractive, than some
of the tales in the earlier book. The story
of the well-to-do suburban family who give
a garden party while a laborer lies dead in
a cottage near their grounds is very simple,
but it is told with amazing fidelity and
charm, and the backgrounds have the wist-
ful beauty that she knows so well how to
give. She is an idolator of beauty—the
warmth of a room, a moonlit road, the stir
of wind in trees. It is probably because
of this that she has such sympathy with the
lives of starved spinsters, such as Miss Brill
and tragic charwomen like Ma Parker. One
of her critics remarks upon her “pure sense
of proportion.” It is admirably shown in
these studies. The pleasure that the appear-
ance or otherwise of an almond in the daily
slice of cake can give is faithfully repro-
duced, and some of these portraits come only
a little distance behind Flaubert’s “Un Coeur
Simple” in intensity.
In fine, what has Miss Mansfield accom-
plished? She has shown us new beauty in
common things; she has taught us to laugh
at Mr. Peacock’s pretensions and possibly
at our own, and that shrivelled hearts bur-
geon unexpectedly and wonderfully.

Of bird-trill shakes the air. Then night’s deep
rest
Is shattered, night’s great shadow suffused,
caressed
By magic of pearl, till royally, wheel on
wheel,
Dawn’s golden chariot leaps upon the sky,
With rosy veils and purple bannerets flung
In spendthrift largess of divine display:
The sun thrust up by God shouts the new
day,
Love laughs with faith renewed, pain sleeps,
and I
Kneel, raising hands of worship; and am
young!

When I was young in green Athlone
The young losa played with me;
While many a golden rann I spun
losa piped the melody.
But now, when years have vanquished me
And I am far from green Athlone,
My grief is that I cannot see
The tender face of Mary’s son.
The Dead Child.
O lovely head of the shining hair,
My house’s bright star,
O petalled hands, little dancing leaves,
Is it still you are?
Sleep, little son, on my breast that knew
Your mouth in sweet years;
Daylight, waken the world to sorrow,
I have no more tears!
Second Love.
Gentle sweet. I will love you truly
Though all your passion’s spent';
Tender you are and I, once unruly,
Find in you content.
But, O mild one, when you lie sleeping
I dream of the dear South,
And my heart, still thirsting, turns again to
weeping
For my first love’s mouth.

Bats.
All winged things are not lovely* yet am I
Dreaming to-day of bats in orange-trees,
Their furry bodies and their fluted wings
Like hairless leathers stretched along a
frame—
Those flying-foxes by the willowed creek
Among the orange groves that flanked a house
Smothered in yellow banksia and white —
Where in the green lagoon the pigmy geese
And brown teal swam unheeded, and the
night
Tasted of weed—and raped gold oranges.
And by the ragged pines I saw the moon
Painting a lunar rainbow on the bough.
And I remember, out at Callandoon,
Where pepper-trees and cedar grew agnihst
A smooth-boled olive and a yucca plant
That conjured always spears and savages,
One moonless night upon a shaven lawn
There came a bat to wheel and circle round
Our Jieads —together bent above a flower !
While from the shallows of the lilied pool
There swelled the boastful croak of prophet
frogs,
While someone, in a vine-screened, lighted
room,
Played the Blue Danube waltz, and round
and round,
As though it turned Doom Unescapable
On the Great Wheel of Life, that lone bat
flew.
How many years ago? How many years?
I do not even know if yet you live,
Or what grassed acre hides your gallant
head!
Bats in the valley of the Theban kings.
Bats hanging from cave roofs in Africa,
Bats in hieh hills of India, that suck
A man’s life as red vintage of his sleep;
Bats flanping o’er the burial chests of
queens
Writing of mystery on haunted air:
Bats in the hollows of the crumbling arch
Of ancient bridges over gloomy streams
Of swift, unreeded hate; bats in church
towers,
Moving in menace on a slow red moon
To stagnant swamps where in the quaking
moss
The murderer drops the gold that smells of
blood ;
Bats in our Brisbane trees, screaming like
knives
On grindstones that have sucked all moisture
up:
Or when the keen fox teeth are sharply set,
Through luscious syrups of the bursting fig;
Bats running monkey-like across bamboos,
Or hanging as black rotting fruit may swing
Along a vendor’s stick in alleyways
Of some plague-stricken Oriental town:
A dead bat, found by some fair, wondering
child
Beneath the tumbled sunsets of a rose
Blown pink about a morn-drenched garden
slope.
All winged things are not lovely! Yet I
muse
To-day of bats in twilights of old trees.
Or making sooty shadow on the moon —
Vile contrast, to enhance her pur : ty!

LAND BOOMS AND CRADLES.
Australia’s biggest city is in the midst of
a land boom at present. So are the other
mainland capitals, but it is Sydney’s turn to
have the disease worst. Of course the thing
isn’t recognised, officially or otherwise, as a
boom. A boom is only known to the multi-
tude (too late for the knowledge to be of
much value) by its being burst, just as a
corpse is most easily recognised by its being-
dead. For the time the movement is ticketed
as “the natural development of a great
metropolis, whose boundless natural re-
sources must make it the queen city of the
Southern Hemisphere,” o» words to the same
effect. Australia is painfully hollow just
now, like a blown egg-shell, or the village of
Ohinemutu ip the Maoriland hot-lake region,
where the heavy visitor • walks cat-fashion
lest he should fall through the earth into
boiling water. The States are borrowing
now at the average rate of £45,000,000 per
annum —£20,000,000 of new debt to cover
the annual interest bill on the old debt,
and £25,000,000 to buy more prosperity with,
so that the land may go on borrowing harder
than ever. Under the circumstances a land
boom is inevitable in the city to which all
the State loan money ultimately gravitates.
The upspringing of that non-productive crea-
ture, the property agent, of whom about 12
new samples open shop daily, is a sign of the
times, and is reminiscent of the glorious
bubble of 30 years ago. Some people, un-
able to account for the multitudinousness of
the apparently superfluous creature on ordi-
nary business lines, speculate that the agent
is really a pious hermit who has run short
of the orthodox cave. Others imagine him
a broken-hearted son of misfortune, like the
owner of E. A. Poe’s stray raven. Still
another set regard him as a brooding mis-
anthrope whose luck in the criminal line is
temporarily out, as explained in this brief
but trenchant passage from a recently un-
published novel:—
Cowed, yet full of hate, Abel Slinker shook his
clenched fist after the graceful but retreating form
of the hero. Then with a howl of battled fury he
fled from the scene and opened an estate agency.
In reality, however, it would seem that there
is a living for practically the whole tribe
—in the better-class residential suburbs
especially—while the boom endures. In
these places very few things are going now
for less than £lOOO, and most things are
from £l5OO upwards—very much upwards.
There is pure sand a long tramway four-
pence from Sydney which is valued at £75
per foot —or it was the other day; it may
be more now. If the agent makes one £lOOO
sale in a fortnight the ±3O commission pays
for the skimpy office, the stationery, depre-
ciation of the bits of furniture, and the cleri-
cal flapper. The rest of the middleman’s
stock-in-trade is a sort of ferocious energy,
like that of a terrier chasing an imaginary
rabbit.
* * * *
Unprecedented loans, and the fixed resolve
of the powers that be to drive all possible
population and every possible industry to
the capital, even if the provincial towns
are beggared in the process, are the
component parts of the boom. Because of
them Sydney, quite apart from recent addi-
tions, is a much bigger book-asset than it
was a little while ago. That is good for the
estate agent and, while the rise continues,
for the speculator. But it isn’t good for
civilisation. Not a long while back the
young couple who had the use of £lOOO could
get a bit of land for £3OO, and erect quite
a proud little mansion for £BOO, and put on
frill, which is a desirable thing in modera-
tion. Now the land costs £BOO, and there is
£2OO left wherewith to build a dog-kennel to
lead a dog’s life in. The game not being
worth the impossible candle, and cottages to
rent being almost extinct, like the pterodac-
tyl, owing to Fair Rents and other crude
interferences, the better-off folk hire the
costly and stereotyped flat, where there is
space for one infant provided there is no
cat. The worse-off rent a “room,” which
means that five families live where there
used to be one. There is space for no infant
at all, though children exist to some extent in
these places, sliding back towards savagery.
It is difficult to see that any good accrues
to anybody save those who don’t deserve it.
Even an affluent person isn’t benefited by
living on £2OOO worth of land instead of on
the same land worth £lOOO, any more than
he is by living on £5 worth of boots instead
of on the same boots worth £2.
The other day that learned man, ex-Justice
Pidpington, delivered an address in Syd-
ney on the decline of the birth-rate, on race
suicide, and on Australians viewed as a
dying people. The birth-rate, of course,
could be put right on paper (and it is the
paper birth-rate that all the trouble is
about) by the simple process of executing
all males above the age of 60, and all females
over 50, as they don’t produce enough chil-
dren to justify the damage they do to the
statistics —-also all lunatics, chronic invalids
and life-sentence prisoners. But that is an-
other tale. The trouble is that the learned
Piddiisigtons always talk of race suicide,
and always dodge the question of race mur-
der. The birth-rate in the big city is con-
siderably less than in the rest of the State,
though the position was otherwise until the
Big City Congestion movement became the
disease it is. Between 1895 and now the
metropolitan population grew from 445,000
to close on a million, while nothing else ex-
panded much. Wherefore the birth-rate
wobbled around in this fashion:—
Births per 100,000 Population.
City. Whole State.
1890-94 (average) 3411 3380
1895-99 „ 2673 2868
1900-04 „ 2516 2699
1905-09 „ 2550 2756
1910-14 „ 2766 2879
1915-19 „ 2502 ' 2665
1920 2526 2610
1921 2454 2592
1922 (to September) 2195 2601
The average birth-rate was bound to fall as
the average age of the community increased,
but there has been no race suicide, and no
trace of race suicide, in the Ma State for
23 years (and that despite the loss of many
fathers and possible fathers in the war) ex-
cept in the overgrown city. But for it there
wotild be improvement, since 1904 anyhow.
And much of the city’s scrap of birth-rate
isn’t its own. One-third or more of the in-
fants who first see the light in the capital are
born in its 82 public hospitals and institu-
tions. But for the mothers who drift in
from the country to these places and to the
innumerable private establishments (un-
married mothers figuring so largely that the
city’s illegitimate birth-rate beats the coun-
try’s by two to one). Sydney might almost
lack the raw r material for a baby show.
* * * *
The biggest city of Australasia is said to
be some 20,000 houses short of its require-
ments. It expects to be short more than
that very soon, and if anything comes of
the proposal to bring the hydro-electric
power of the Snow T y River there, and thus
make it the one supremely cheap manufac-
turing centre of the Commonwealth, the
roof-famine should increase a hundred per
cent. And many of the places that aren’t
short are the kind which ought to be, as
witness the recent report of one of the in-
numerable estate agents, that he had just
let an old two-rooms-and-kitchen humpy
without bath or laundry, and located in an
alley, for 80s. per week. There is now no
space for the second child in a non-capital-
istic family to be born in, or at least to sur-
vive in. and not much space for the first.
From these considerations arises the question
whether a charge of infant-murder should
not be laid against the politicians and others
who oppose, largely in the estate-agency in-
terest, the making of new States, and the
opening of new ports by new railways, so
that new towns may arise to relieve the pres-
sure. And the papers and parsons and Pip-
pingtons who look on when they might
help may be accessories. The alternative
to new cities —garden cities with lots of
room and all the latest town-planners’ im-
provements —appears to be the heaping up
or tenement houses at the old address. Yet
for a country with only the beginnings of a
population to be reduced to the tenement-
house existence is like Crusoe being over-
crowded on his island.
THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE
R.A.N.
“Theke is no ‘public opinion’ on Australian
defence.” With that. remarkable assertion
the Argus began a recent article to demon-
strate that, as regards naval defence, there
was a very definite public opinion, and that
the latter was in favor of abolishing the
R.A.N. and going back to the system in
vogue “when Australia consisted of a num-
ber of separate colonies and was dependent
entirely on the British Navy for protection.”
The Argus lacks the nerve apparently to
carry its views to their logical conclusion
and call for a scrapping of Australia’s land
forces and a reversion to the militarism of
Macquarie’s day. In consequence it
attempts to differentiate the functions of a
navy and those of an army:—
Australia essayed to be independent when it
established its own navy, but it was not indepen-
dent in fact. The Australian Navy did excellent
work, but it did nothing which it could not have
done had it been in name, as it was in fact, a
part of the British Navy. A great part of the
work of the Australian Navy in the war was done
thousands of miles from the Australian coast. The
duty which fell to the fleet was one which a great
many of the early advocates of the Australian Navy
would have been opposed to its undertaking. It is
highly improbable that actual fighting will take
place in Australian waters. Land defence must be
adequate, but the only way to decide upon its
adequacy is by a full consideration of the dangers.
The particular method by which land defence will be
organised will be decided by the Commonwealth in
its own way, but nothing can be decided until it
is known what the circumstances require. Navul
defence is in a different category. The policy of
a separate Australian navy is obsolete. It belongs
to a period of adolescence, and Australia has out-
grown it.
* * * *
This attempt to differentiate the land and
sea forces must fail. The facts that apply
to one apply to the other. The very first
lesson the Great War taught Australia was
that the Empire’s fighting forces on land, as
on sea, had to be homogeneous. At the
Landing there was no difference between the
organisation, weapons and fighting methods
of the Australians and those of any other
troops under General lan Hamilton. Later,
in Flanders, Australian and British bat-
talions fought side by side with success; and
Australian brigades relieved British ones in
the line, and vice versa, without a hitch.
For fighting purposes an Australian or
Maoriland unit was as much a British unit
as a Scotch or an Irish unit was. Every
single jeer levelled by the Argus at the
R.A.N. applies with equal force to the
A.I.F. The A.1.F., to employ the Argus’s
patronising phrase, “did excellent work”;
but it could not have fought Germany alone,
and to that extent Australia “was not inde-
pendent in fact” The work of the A.1.F.,
like the work of the R.A.N., was done
“thousands of miles from Australia.” And,
as the w r ar showed, it is even more desir-
able for a nation to have its land battles
fought on foreign territory than it is to
have its naval battles fought off someone
else’s coasts. The Argus makes the extra-
ordinary statement that “the particular
method by which land defence will be organ-
ised will be decided by the Commonwealth
in its own way, but nothing can be decided
until it is known what the circumstances
require.” The organisation of land defences
was, in fact, decided by an amendment to
the Defence Act which became law two years
ago. The basis of that organisation is the
divisional system; and its object is to enable
our army divisions to so harmonise with the
British divisions on the post-war War Office
plan that in the event of another war
(which, please God! will be fought “thou-
sands of miles from the Australian coast”)
each Australian unit will be interchangeable
with a corresponding British unit.
* * * *
There was no more question in any sane
Australia’s mind, during the late war, of the
R.A.N. hanging round the coasts of the
Commonwealth in splendid isolation, as a
proof of our independence, than there was
that the A.I.F. should select a front of its
own in Palestine or France or Wagga Wagga
and fight there without relation to the acti-
vities of the rest of the Empire. And until
the anti-defence propaganda of papers of the
Argus stamp in South Africa, Canada and
elsewhere does its work and the Empire
crashes, there never will be any such ques-
tion. But that is not to say that this is the
time to jettison the one asset of real value
which Australia achieved in the war —its
pride in itself and in its national army and
navy. Nothing is easier than to be humor-
ous at the expense of the thousand and one
little privileges, traditions and conceits of
the Guards, the Marines, the famous County
regiments and, for that matter, the R.N.
itself. But neither statesmen, nor great
soldiers and sailors, nor those writers whose
business it is to interpret the psychology of
nations have yielded to this cheap method
of getting a laugh or making a point. Absurd
though it may appear to one who solves all
his political problems without reference to
the human-nature factor, yet such truths
remain as that a patriotic man of Inverness
will proudly serve in the Argyle and Suther-
land Highlanders where he would scorn a
Welsh Fusilier regiment, while a Welshman
might be neither a useful nor a welcome
addition to the Black Watch. Some Aus-
tralians did good work in the British Army
just as some did good work in the R.N. But
the rule was that Australians gave best
results, whether on land or sea, as Austra-
lians ; and so acutely did the War Office, the
Admiralty and the Australian Government
come to realise this, as the tragedy dragged
on, that they took every means in their
power to emphasise the distinction between
the Commonwealth services and those with
which they were co-operating. No British
soldier who knew his job would dream of
suggesting that for the purposes of any
future war Australia’s military formations
would do best if swamped in British forma-
tions ; and, similarly, no British sailors who
know their job are now to be found argu-
ing with the . Argus that “the policy of a
separate Australian navy is obsolete.” Here,
for example, is what Lieut.-Commander R.
D. King Harman. R.N.. told an inter-
viewer before returning to England a few
days ago:—
Though I am an Englishman I deplore the anti-
Australian feeling displayed by many Australians.
If I were an Australian I would fight tooth and
nail to make the Australian Navy a credit to its
country and a source of envy to other countries. .. .
The discipline of the Australian sailor is excellent.
It compares quite favorably with the discipline O:
the long-established British Navy, where tradition is
old and plays an important part. There is r.o
difference between the sailors of the R.N. and those
of the R.A.N. Both love their work ; but the
British sailor receives thanks, while the equally
capable Australian sailor receives nothing but gibes.
And the parting message of Commodore
Edwards, R.N., was :
Take pride in your fleet. The R.A.N. is an abso-
lute necessity to Australia.
As professional sailors these men know that
a separate Australian navy will fit into the
Empire defence scheme as readily in time of
war as a separate Australian army. And,
being educated men as well as sailors, they
recognise that there is no more hope of the
present generation of Australians being in-
duced to pay for a hired navy than there is
of its being induced to pay for a hired army.
On this issue such organs as the Argus are
in conflict with one of the imponderables of
statecraft, and the only effect of their clamor
is to assist the local Moscow propaganda in
favor of disarming Australia altogether.
AN EASTER SERMON.
This is the season of the year when the
churches are a shade more unanimous than
usual, the unanimity going so far that the
sects of Greek and Latin descent occasion-
ally hold Good Friday on the same day by
accident. The English name for the occa-
sion was derived, after the easy-compromise
fashion of the daybreak of Christianity, from
a goddess made in Germany—a poor person,
Eostre by name —whose bunfight chanced
in April. The real day of Crucifixion almost
certainly fell on one of the five days over
which the nominal day is allowed to wander,
but the legendary date roams all tne distance
between April 15, in the year 29, and April
3, 33. A singularity or melancholy dignity
attaches to the Easter of 1923, for while it is
in progress a brutish and unlettered race
of Mohammedan Tartars is busy uprooting
Christianity around Antioch, where it was
born and received its name, and is raging at
large among the debris of the Seven Churches
of Asia —though there is less debris than
there * might be, for under Turkish rule five
of the cities had either vanished before the
latest commotion began, or had sunk to the
status of mean villages. Meanwhile the
Christian world, perhaps through lack of
sentiment, perhaps through lack of a sense
of the ridiculous, looks on with a protocol
in its hand.
_ Good Friday is not so definitely a Chris-
tian occasion as it is the day of the beginning
of a misunderstanding which changed the
entire course of history, and the day of an irre-
parable wrong to Jewry. In those times there
was a Teacher who did not profess to bring
any new doctrine forward under the plea
that the Almighty had been supplied with
fresh information. It was left to the robust
and venturous Paul to tell the congrega-
tion which he had collected around him in
the old Greek city of Antioch that the ancient
Law was abolished. If there were capital
letters in those days Paul deserved them
for his—let us call it courage. But the Great
Teacher taught that the old Law was good
enough if only it was observed, and it war,
the demand for sincere and sympathetic ob-
servance which brought Him .to Golgotha on
“God’s Friday.” A very similar fate has since
befallen thousands of minor teachers, who
also said that the old Law was good enough
if only it was observed. In fact, the world
has often given a much more cheery wel-
come to the man with an alleged fresh creed
just dropped from the sky—a plastic young
creed that busy, fussy hands could seize
upon and mould into all sorts of shapes till
it was all things to all men—than to the
one who said that the ancient religion was
all right, and only the grasping, perfidious
and cruel tyrants who perverted it and made
wealth out of it were all wrong. The civil,
military and ecclesiastical forces of the
State have generally united against that
sort of reformer, and if he had nothing
behind him save the other 97 \ per cent, or
the community his chance was only moderate.
Christ’s recipe for securing “eternal life”
w T as simple and short: —
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neigh-
bor as thyself.
The statement that this covered all the
essentials put the temple and the sacrifices,
and the priest and Levite, and their
powers, dignities, salaries, perquisites, robes,
regalia, mysteries and incantations into
the superfluous class. Still it would have
passed as mere formula had not the Teacher
explained with an intensity of eloquence
that loving one’s neighbor as oneself was
not compatible with the stealing of widows’
houses and all the mean sins in the cat-
egory. Relations between these widely dif-
ferent advocates of the old Law became
strained as they never did in the case of
Paul, who devised a new law of his own
And when the Reformer consigned, not to
plain, everyday damnation, but to “greater
damnation.” all ecclesiastical authority,
unless it abandoned the sins which were its
sole visible means of support, no place but
Golgotha and no day but God’s Friday could
lie ahead. The case was one in which the
love and devotion of 971 per cent, of the
Hebrew folk —the unarmed and unorganised
majority—ceased to count. Paul, wander-
ing learnedly among points of doctrine,
avoided such .whole-souled
Then came to pass the one recorded alli-
ance of any importance between Church and
State in New Testament records. The State
might be foreign, oppressive, idolatrous and
hateful, but the Church was in the diffi-
culty of its life', and felt that the two
authorities should sink their differences and
work together for the common bad. The
Temporal Power, being in the business of
stealing widows’ houses itself, as well as
annexing bigger things, probably felt no sym-
pathy for reformers of any sort. Its animosity,
however, seems to have been languid compared
with that of the ecclesiastical element. Still,
the coalition came about, and Italian soldiers
made the arrest, which was a sur-
reptitious midnight adventure because of
the overwhelming popular feeling in


favor of the Teacher. And an Italian official
passed sentence, and scourged the prisoner
personally, which seems rather beneath even
a minor Governor’s dignity, and wrote a
mocking inscription to decorate the Cross;
and the Italian military, with whom it
was distinctly a busy day, attended to the
reviling and mockery and miscellaneous ill-
usage, also the spitting, the actual crucifix-
ion, and the stealing of the victim’s clothes.
Apparently a claque of the baser sort, prob-
ably drawn from what would be the Chinese
quarter nowadays, was on hand to represent
public opinion. The number and even the
nationality of these supers is not too cer-
tain, but they are vaguely described as “the
multitude.” Italy hasn’t been wholly at
ease in its mind ever since about its share
in the tragedy, and has spoken severely
about .Tews on many occasions to divert sus-
picion. Likewise it has built a wonderful
number of cathedrals by way of proving an
alibi, and some of them are beautiful enough
to prove almost anything.
The proposition that man, to achieve sal-
vation, should really love his neighbor as
himself, and act as if he did. made little
headway. In fact, it died with its Author
on the Cross. But out of the life-history
which ended on “God’s Friday,” there was
built (chiefly by the superhumanly energetic
Pafi.) an amazingly different creed, and it
gradually included many forms and cere-
monies, strenuous persecution of people who
thought differently, very little love of any
bird, and full permission to be consistently
malignant to neighbors, provided the account
was squared before death according to cer-
tain rules about which the sects still dis-
agree viciously. It is a long time now since
that Friday on Golgotha, and considering
what happened to Jerusalem some 37 years
later it is probable that very few descendants
«'f the actors survive. The Jew has protested
at intervals ever since about the illogical
view generally taken of the case. And as
the odds are a million to one against any
ordinary Hebrew' being related either to the
small clique which arranged matters with
Pilate, or the small claque which shouted
encouragement at that morbid dignitary, or
the few scoffers at the Cross, the Jew has
a good case. But so far his protest has been
little heeded.
JAMES EDMOND.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Parasite and Producer.
A N. S. Wai.es farmer a hundred miles from
Sydney lately sent five tons of swede turnips
to the city, there being no market of any
account nearer. After paying road cartage,
railway freight and charges he had 15s. for
himself—nearly enough to pay his seed hill.
A fruitgrower within 20 miles of Sydney sent
a load of plums to the same market. lie
had less luck: charges of one sort and
another left him 3d. per case in debt. Of
course he didn’t send any more. Instead, he
let tons of fine fruit rot under*the trees and
added another to the long list of orchards
for sale. The farm where the turnips grew
has passed through three hands during the
last seven years, and is also looking for
another buyer. When the turnip man senj
his lot to market Sydney was paying 2d.
per lb. for swedes—over £93 for five tons.
The man who bought the farm, and no doubt
borrowed the money to do it with, worked
the ground, bought the seed and harvested
the crop, got 15s. The figures are almost as
startling in the other case. What is the
matter? No question can be more important
—it is vastly more important than whether
Dooley 'or McGirk wins the cat-fight—
because in neither of the two instances can
these growers carry on; they must either
sell or abandon their farms and look for
another job. And what they do hundreds of
other farmers must do. Hear after year
millions are spent in putting men on the
land. Fewer shillings are spent in getting
them a market. The one job is easy; the
other tremendously difficult. It is easy
enough to talk about co-operation; and co-
operatioh would certainly help—a great deal
could be done for these men by organising
them. But no amount of organising will
make their position quite satisfactory. The
simple fact is there are five times-—perhaps
10 times—too many people who can only live
by taking a bite out of these unfortunate
producers. The huge army of non-producers
in the bloated city have got to live on some-
body ; and in the last resort they must live
either on producers or on loans. The pro-
portion of non-producers to producers is so
great that long ago the burden on the latter
would have been crushing if the true position
had not been masked by borrowing. But
loans don’t solve the problem: they only
put off the necessity for solving it, and make
it a more difficult problem. The wheat-
grower has a pretty hard row to hoe, but
to a certain extent he can escape the horde
of parasites. They can’t at any rate pay
him just what they please for liis produce.
If wheat was in the same category as tur-
nips and plums, and had to find a local mar-
ket or none at all, it would by this time be
•selling for a shilling a bushel. But though
the wheat- like the wool-grower is not at
the mercy of the local market for the sale
of his harvest, he is in regard to all he has
to purchase. His railway freight has doubled
in a few years. His wheat brings him in
■ - >s. 6d. or 4s. a bushel, and it has been often
below 3s. 6d. Out of that the majority of
the men who have been “put on the land’’
during this last decade have to pay from
•id. to Bd. for rail carriage. The four-bushel
wheat sack in use until eight or ten years
ago rarely cost 6d. The three-bushel sack
now costs from 9d. to lid. His taxes have
more than doubled—when he earns enough to
pay any. Still, as said just now, he can
more or less escape the parasite so far as
his sales are concerned : the unfortunate tur-
nip and plum men are at its mercy both
for buying and for selling. The more any
group of producers can escape, the more the
unfortunates who can’t escape have to
suffer. (Somebody has to keep the creature
-until it can be induced to chance its habits.
The only real hope for any brand of pro-
ducer is to put himself out of the control
of the local market. And so far as the fruit
and vegetable is ''oncc-nod that means
canning and dehydrafrg wo-ks. Even then
■ e will be onl v ha’f wt y out of the wood.
His income wl.l be better, but his outgoings
will be excessive; and that can be got over
only by the stoppage of borrowing, the con-
sequent stoppage of unprofitable railway and
other works at grotesquely extravagant cost,
the increase of exportable products, the de-
crease of imports capable of local manufac-
ture, and the consequent removal of thou-
sands who are now in the parasite class to
the producer class.

Plain Tales from the North.
The latest jest from the North concerns the
Pine Creek hotel. It was a good ordinary
bush pub when the Federal Government
took it over. It was a dilapidated shack
when the high authority admitted failure,
and let the place to Private Enterprise again,
and it remains so. In fact, the Federal land-
lord has been warned by his own magistrate
that unless he makes his Federal board-and-
lodging hovel habitable the license will be
discontinued. While Darwin and Pine
Creek remain further from the seat of gov-
ernment, in point of time, than San Fran-
cisco and Chicago are, the Territory will
inevitably struggle along in this slatternly
way. The Bruce-Page Government could,
without any breach of faith, sell off Canberra
for what it wo'uld fetch. But it can’t fail
to build the South-to-North railway, nor
deviate it from the prescribed route into any
other State, without losing its honor, and
it can’t go on talking of the matter as it
does, as something quite casual and optional,
without getting mud on its reputation for
fair-dealing and truthfulness. There is even
a limit to delay, seeing that the contract has
been signed, and lavish payment accepted in
land. The fast-and-loose game that has been
played for years may be good enough for
snide lawyers and land-jobbers and two-
uppers and their hangers-on, but it is “un-
English,” as the famous Mr. Podsnap used
to say. If it isn’t also un-Australian then
so much the worse for Australia. As to the
urgency of the respective works, there is no
comparison. Nobody has pointed out any
great loss that has arisen through waiting
for Canberra, or shown that Barton, Wat-
son, Reid, Cook and the almost eternal
Hughes, who have ruled Australia from be-
side the Yarra, would have ruled better from
beside the Cotter. But in the Territory a
Federal property more than twice the size
of Germany before the war has deteriorated,
while waiting for means of communication,
till it ranks, for the time being, as an empire
that isn’t worth 2d. As the Administrator
put it in his latest report: —
Business is very depressed. Mining is at a low
ebb. The fisheries industry is stagnant. Agricul-
ture is negligible. The pastoral industry is passing
through a period of depression. Production has
stopped. Industry has ceased. Shipping has dis-
appeared. No capital is coming in. Unemployment
is an ugly problem.
And so on. It is a companion picture to
that of Russia under the Bolshevik regime,
with the differences that, there being in the
Territory’s case an outside Government to
supply food and free steamboat tickets at
outside people’s expense, deaths from hunger
and cannibalism have not been reported. Yet,
with this monumental disgrace on its hands,
and with the reputation of each individual
Minister for straight dealing at stake, the
soft-spoken Cabinet has tiptoed into recess,
and its principal activity (at least the one
we hear most about) is the making of smooth
tennis-lawns for its personal use and comfort
at Canberra.
“Up Journey.”
Another item was added to the tale of
the steady destruction of N.S.W. country-
town industries for the further bloating of
the city, when a deputation called on the
Minister of Agriculture to say that the big
Glen Innes flour-mill was on its final hoofs.
It has lasted a quarter-century, and has been
a great employer of labor, but the latest
manipulations of railway freights say it
must give way to something in Sydney, or
nearer Sydney. The point is that the flour-
miller’s raw material, if bound on the “up
journey” towards Sydney (“up journey” is
carefully specified in the table on page 15
of the N.S.W. railway report for 1922),
pays the lowest rate on record —less than
half the cost of carriage and less than one-
fifth the rate charged on wool. If going
the other way it gets no concession. This
is to ensure that all exported grain must
go out via Sydney, even if other ports are
handier, and that the big flour-milling busi-
ness shall keep as close to the capital as
possible. With the latest increases in freights
it would seem that any mill which has to
draw its supplies from a point between it
and Sydney may as well close up, for it is
committing the unpardonable sin of direct-
ing traffic the wrong way. The matter has
been explained to every jack-in-office since
the country industries began to perish, and
every jaek-in-office has shaken his sapient
cranium and said it was a large dark ques-
tion, like the number of the Brute of Reve-
lation, and he would have to wallow in
thought. The new Minister also looked
wise, and took out his prescription-book,
and soid the usual things:—
The Government was anxious to keep all industries
going.
They all recognised that the railway freights
provided a very mixed question.
If you pick out isolated cases, then, of course,
you are going to become hopelessly mixed.
And a lot more chatty outpouring to the
same lack of purpose. Meanwhile the out-
standing fact is that, at June, 1921,
there were 1013 more factories in the
metropolis than 10 years previously, and
215 less in all “the rest of the State.”
Ten years ago, “the rest of the State” had
til’s si ; ght preponderance, that there were in
its 309,000 squafe miles 19 more factories
than in the metropolitan 185-or-so square
miles, and though it was a sufficiently dread-
ful case of congestion it showed that there
were still traces of life outside the Bloated
I‘lace. But at June. 1921, there were 1209
more factories in Sydney than everywhere
else; also the capital had 104.552 factory
workers, while the nncons'dered “rest of
the State” had 40.459. Something might
be done to equalise matters if the two words
“Up Journey” were struck out. but none
of the soft-spoken shirkers of the old school
have a leaning that way. It isn’t in the pro-
gramme. So there is no visible prospect till
the South and North set up for themselves,
and make their own railway and port
arrangements.
Disqualify Them!
In the iast few months magistrates and
Judges have shown a gratifying tendency to
inflict gaol without the option on criminals
who specialise in animal torture. In most
of these cases the animal has died as a result
of its ill-treatment. In those where the vic-
tim has survived, the torturer has resumed
control over it when he has come out. A
term in gaol is not likely to render one who
has, say, cut a pony to pieces with a barb-
wire whip any sweeter-natured. It is de-
batable whether a man who has been con-
victed of such gi'oss cruelty should not ipso
facto be debarred from owning or attending
to an animal again. It is certainly reason-
able that he should afterwards be compelled,
when either buying an animal or applying
for a job involving the care of animals, to
disclose his previous conviction or convie-
iions for cruelty. Much the same applies
where children are cohcerned. A Mrs.
Beatrice Hehir, of Glen Osmond (S.A.),
was given two months the other day for ill-
treating an infant stepchild who had stolen
eightpence:—
She took the lad, and holding his fingers over a
lighted candle, burnt eight of them, as she said, to
represent the eight pennies which he had stolen. The
boy was severely burn* and suffered a great deal of
pain. He was sent to bed without tea and to school
the following morning without breakfast. She re-
fused to allow him to put bandages around the blis-
tered fingers.
Not only should such a perverted character
never again be allowed to look after the
particular child that got her into trouble,
but she should be prevented from freely
exercising authority over any child.
The Bolshevik Barrister.
Owen Dixon, K.C., arrived back in Mel-
bourne from representing the States before
the Privy Council in the Engineers case,
observed: —
I was impressed by an absence of that directness
of speech between the Bench and Bar which is
characteristic of procedure in Australian courts. Pro-
ceedings over there are very impressively conducted.
Owing to the great pressure of business a system
has been adopted of getting counsel to minimise
the amount of argument to be conducted in court.
This is a guarded method of saying what
The Bulletin has been insisting on for
years past. But there 'is no need to go to
London for lessons in the way Bench and
Bar should comport themselves. The
majority of our senior counsel, in every
State, are as respectful to the Bench as
counsel could be in any part of the Empire;
and those who indulge in judge-baiting, or
who decline to “minimise the amount of
argument to be conducted in court,” know
they are violating traditions which, until
recently, the Australian Bar cherished quite
as dearly as the English Bar. The Bar
Council has no means of punishing a K.C.
who, for example, deliberately insults a
judge. It never had. The vast improve-
ment in the tone of the English Bar since
the epoch of Sergeant Buzfuz —an improve-
ment which, till recently, was reflected pretty
faithfully at the Australian Bar —has been
brought about chiefly by the general body
of barristers. The judges have helped, not
by committing riotous counsel to prison—
though that has been done both in England
and in Australia —but rather by creating
outside the cpurts an atmosphere favorable
to discipline and probity inside them. As
Mr. Dixon remarked, the proceedings are
conducted more expeditiously in the English
courts than in some of ours, but this is not
primarily “owing to the great pressure of
business”: the reason is that the modern
British advocate considers it an indelible
stain on his professional Reputation to waste
the Court’s time. One may sit for a day in
an English court, when great K.C.’s are
appearing on both sides, and not hear a soli-
tary objection. The simple explanation is,
in the first place, that counsel know their
jobs, and therefore do not in ignorance put
questions which are inadmissible; and, in
the second place, that they are honest men,
and hence do not challenge admissible ques-
tions as a means of stnnging-out suits and
thereby earning more money. The pressure
of business is relatively as great in, say,
Sydney, where the work in some of the
courts is now many months in arrears. The
difference lies in the fact that with us the
ignoble trade of objecting, on any and every
pretext, and then using the objection as a
peg on w’hich to hang a three-hours’ argu-
ment, is fast becoming a feature of every
case where “the money is good.” How is
this convention —one disastrous to the pres-
tige of the courts as well as villainously un-
fair to litigants—to be scotched? The answer
is that, as an affair of practical politics, no
one can scotch it but the lawyers themselves.
If the best of them lack the moral courage
to say in public what they think in private,
then the worst of them will go cheerfully on
till they bring the judiciary down to* tne
level of a State Assembly in the public
estimation.
What Ails Our Gaols?
“C. Division” gives his views:-
The “reticences” of the N.S.W. Prisons Depart-
ment (vide “2nd Divvy,” B. 15/3/’23) go to strange
lengths. The Salvation Army, for instance, although
in my experience it is easily the most alive and
humanly religious concern in Australia, is debarred
from doing anything whatsoever for men within
the prison walls. And why? Because, forsooth,
the Salvation Army has not got any people of its
own persuasion in gaol. The way the paid poli-
ticians and parsons hang together, in order to keep
the Army out, and prevent it or any other similarly
sincere body of men and women from doing any
good to the bodies and souls of those “inside,”
casts a peculiar light upon modern official ehurehdom.
And that reminds me. Recently, at Goulburn, a
Church of England prison chaplain advocated longer
sentences for men in gaol. He said that under
the short-sentence system the church had not much
chance of doing anything for men behind the walls.
Noble Christianity, this! In Goulburn Gaol, where
I spent two years, the local chaplain talked for
months of an entertainment that he intended to
give us. Finally, in the dead of winter, when the
physical pain of sitting in the upstairs refrigerator
they call a church was enough to stiffen one, he
brought along his entertainment. It consisted of
a magic-lantern, showing (this is cold fact) Peary’s
expedition to the North Pole!
The Goulburn chaplain distinguished himself by
one other brilliant Christian deed during my term
there. He caused the removal from the prison
library of Winston Churchill's splendid novel,
“The Inside of the Cup.” This book roasts the
Episcopalian Church for its indifference to social
problems. And so the chaplain had the volume
destroyed. This meant that not only every Anglican
prisoner, but also every inmate of other denomi-
nations, was robbed of the pleasure of reading that
straight and honest book. And when the chaplain
was asked what book or books he intended to donate
to the prison library in place of Churchill’s novel,
he said coldly that it was not the business of the
church to supply prisoners with good literature.
Its sole function was to see that bad and, ahem!
pernicious literature was kept out.
That is what ails our gaols. There is nobody
who plays the part of prisoners’ friend. There is
no outside organisation, either, that a man in prison
with a legitimate grievance can reach. In theory,
a man can see the Minister for Justice and state
his case. I, for instance, made a request to be
allowed to see the then Minister. First I saw
the governor, and explained to him what I wanted.
He gave me permission to see the Comptroller-
General. The Comptroller-General said all right. And
then, with a gleam of hope in my heart, I began
to wait. One year and 11 months passed. Then,
when the emergency of a by-election for Goulburn
arose, the Minister for Justice paid a visit to Goul-
burn Gaol. What for? To see men like me? No!
To shake hands with every “screw,” because the
latter possessed votes.
That is the sort of experience that breaks the
hearts of men in “stir.” Talk about reticence! The
brand of studied aloofness that parsons, politicians,
etc., go in for, with regard to the helpless creatures
behind the bars, is enough to break the heart. A
good-conduct man myself, in prison, never losing
a single mark during the whole time that I spent
there, I affirm that starving and freezing men in
gaol, robbing them of decent literature and feeding
their minds on imaginary icebergs, does nothing
to prepare them for a return to decent citizenship.
Jesus Christ at least handed around a few loaves
and fishes.
•
The Good-Roads Herring.
Imitation is the blessed gift which saves the
monkey’s life from being a blank, but it isn’t
the best stock-in-trade for a Minister. A
herd of free travellers has been pervading the
X. 8. Wales South Coast, talking about the
“Prince’s Highway,” which runs parallel
with the shore, so that it brings no trade to
the isolated ports, and about the Snowy
River hydro-electric “scheme,” which is to
supply power for the industries that can’t
be there until there is an outlet for their
products. Then Bam., Minister for Works,
made a speech : —•
He was quite satisfied that the time was not far
distant when most of our transport would be by
motors over good roads, and there would not be the
necessity for railways or even tramways. Motor
transport* was already competing successfully with
the railways where good roads were available. The
Government would be more justified in giving good
roads than in spending money on the development of
non-paying railways.
This sort of thing doesn’t mean that Minister
Bawl and his colleagues will suspend the
construction of the city railway, or any of
the new lines that are to bring trade to Syd-
ney. In fact, they are spending nearly
£1,000,000 per month of loan money on pro-
jects of the kind. But it is meant to serve
as the 25th explanation why such places as
Eden and Jervis Bay and Coif’s Harbor never
get lines" to connect them with the interior.
The Government is waiting for someone to
give them something much better—fine
roads and fleets of motors, instead of the
smoky and obsolete trains that are good
enough for the metropolitan district. It is
the sort of thing you hear in America,
where the petrol-driven motor on the
highway does compete with the rail-
way for short hauls. But, then, in 1921,
the United States produced 469,639,000 bar-
rels of oil to drive its motors with. All the
rest of the world produced only 281,000,000
barrels, and Australia’s share of the produc-
tion was a whiff of dubious smell from the
Roma bore. This country, however de-
mented it may be, isn’t going to neglect the
coal it has for the petrol it hasn’t. It isn’t
going to' dismantle its coal-burning locomo-
tives, which it cun keep in commission, and
depend on oil-craft, which might be all
laid up and helpless when a war or blockade
happened, or when Uncle Sam stopped ex-
ports because he wanted the oil himself.
And it isn’t going to close a large or small
proportion of its mines, and turn the miners
adrift, apd give up its independence, for the
joy of paying for foreign fuel and living-
on the edge of a precipice. Whatever smooth
twaddle Minister Bawl may talk to the folk
of the South Coast about railways being-
out of date as a reason for not giving them
the long-w’aited-for line to Twofold Bay, he
doesn’t propose to prove his sincerity by
scrapping N. S. Wales’s £85,000,000 worth of
loan lines, or any part of them. In addi-
tion, no matter how much he may discourse
about “good roads” being the right and
superior thing, he shows little sign of sup-
plying even a good goat-track, except in the
immediate vicinity of the big city. In
short, he is an unconvincing humbug, and his
effort to persuade the people of the dissatisfied
districts that they are neglected for their
own good ought not to deceive a child.
What’s the Mattel* with Cocky?
“Ganesha” puts one view* of the case:—
The thoughts of the cocky haven’t been widened
worth mentioning by the process of the suns. Some-
body has shoved the idea into his head that he is
the primary producer, and that everybody who is
not a primary producer, or part of the backbone of
the country, is a parasite and his natural enemy.
He can never realise that a community is a com-
plex and well-balanced organism, and not merely a
backbone. He wants freetrade, so that he can buy
a cheap harrow or a gramophone. He would even
import wood from the furthest ends of the earth to
get a fruit case a penny cheaper. It hasn’t dawned
on him .vet that what he needs, and what the country
needs, is more people to consume the stuff, lie
never thinks that it would be desirable to have
more towns and more home markets. His is a dream
of lands far away. At present he has great faith
in China. He thinks placards shoqld be put up in
the Flowery Land exhorting the Celestials to eat
more fruit. He has found out that the London
market is not all it was cracked up to be. He
knows he can grow as good fruit as California;
but the fact that California can sell it, because
there are other people besides primary producers in
the States, hasn’t yet penetrated his consciousness.
His politicians have encouraged him in his devotion
to his own sectional interests, which in practice
are not his real interests. It is absurd how one
section of the country fights another. There is no
idea of balance, give and take, co-operation. At
present the balance is all wrong, as it is in England.
England has too many industries, we haven’t

nearly enough. And nobody would benefit more, if
we manufactured more of our own necessities, than
the cocky. Without a doubt many country towns
are parasitic—they' are full of shopkeepers, agents
and auctioneers. It is a pitiful sight if the word
has gone round that Cocky Brown is thinking of
buying a sewing-machine. Next morning half-a-
dozen agents are round at his place tossing up to
settle who is to see him first. We need towns,
real towns doing real work, as well as farms. And
when we have them the cocky will be much happier,
finding a market close at hand instead of dreaming
dreams of selling grapes and peaches to Lapland.
"Saaedi’s” hand in the debate:—
Someone raises (B. 15/3./’23) a raucous voice
to express his disgust with and
stock-raisers generally. Much of what he
say's is partly' true, more is wildly exaggerated,
some is quite erroneous. The contributor
says he has lived for 50 years “among the
men on the land,’’ and all that time “has heard
a chronic growl about the hardships they endure
and the money they are losing.” He adds, that
“very many have retired, and have lovely' houses
and cars all, no doubt, out of the money they have
lost.” That much money is made on the land
(often without great effort) is true; that much
money is lost on the land (often despite tremendous
effort) is also true. More than any other occupa-
tion (not excepting the flourishing pony business of
Sydney) the land is a gamble. This is inevitable,
considering the number of unknown and unknow-
able elements that are continually taking a hand to
the bucolic one’s bewilderment and downfall. That
the issue of this hazardous warfare is very often
unfavorable to the agrarian is indicated by the mul-
titude of mortgage sales advertised in every ‘ country
newspaper, and by the unanswerable statistical evi-
dence of a pronounced drift citywards. Further,
the man on the land is charged with being a para-
site, a preyer on benevolent Governments, a
Micawber with an eternal grouch. A host of things
are mentioned that the bucolic burglar wants to
wrest from the Government. Some of these things,
incidentally, are not demanded by one agrarian in
a thousand (stud bulls, for instance). Some, on
the other hand, such as experimental farms, are
naturally and inevitably Government activities. For
the rest, it has been the spectacle of the bureau-
cratic kites ,at Potts Point and the industrial para-
sites at Surry Hills (both products of loan works
and bloated city policy) that has made the bucolic
rather madder than Nature intended he should be.
His critic sneers at the soil straggler for requiring
rabbit and stock and noxious-weed inspectors, and
says: “This country is kept poor by paying armies
of inspectors to make the man on the land do things
for his own good.” Rubbish! The Pastures Pro-
tection Boards, which pay rabbit, stock and noxious-
weed inspectors, represent a collective effort to pre-
serve the purity of the pastures, and are elected and
supported solely by stockowners, and not by the
country generally. Carelessness on the part of one
landholder will endanger the properties of many
neighbors, and to blame a class for protecting itself
against a few improvident ones, and then infer that
the few represent the class, is absurdly illogical.
Human nature is much the same ■at Balmain as at
Bourlce, and the soil-tickler and stock-raiser growls
more than most people simply because he has greater
cause.
“Dune” adds a point or two: —
Certainly we want cheap seed wheat, and why do
we protest against paying right up after a few days’
grace? Why did the Government grab all our wheat
during the war and pool it and give us a mere
pittance ? What wheat cocky got the full prices ?
If we aren’t paid for our grain right up, why should
we run ourselves short by paying for seed when
the Government has some of our cash still ? The
cocky does not want an army of rabbit inspectors to
force him to eradicate the pest. What he does want
is a bombshell to make our fool Government clean
up Crown lands and the shires clean up their roads.
There are few Crown lands or shire roads which
are not alive with rabbits. What average farmer
can afford to put up, say, 10 miles of netting at
£9O per mile to fence his land from these public
breeding depots? The same applies to noxious weeds.
Crown and Railway lands are infested with them.
Money? Of course they haven’t the money. The rail-
ways, having been made the plaything and stalking-
horse of politicians, are overloaded with men who don’t
earn their salt; and the shires have to maintain
roads which are the speedways of motorists who
don’t pay a farthing towards their upkeep. And
we do co-operate—not as much as we should per-
haps, but still effectively as far as it goes. Our
Agricultural Bureaus have made great strides in
the last few years. Let the man who has “lived
among cockies for 50 years” join a country
bureau and hear for himself the interchange of ideas.
Let him hear the ideas and suggestions of the Gov-
ernment experts who make periodical visits to these
branch meetings and demonstrations. The roll up
of cockies—at the demonstrations especially—is
surprising.
Having It Both Ways.
A snarl from The Bulletin’s Stipendiary
Nark:—
During the World War, Woman, and more particu-
larly Young Woman, grabbed her freedom with both
hands, and, employing it as a weapon of offence, pro-
ceeded to shatter most of the conventions of the pre-
vious hundred years or so. As a result a curious
and, incidentally, rather exasperating situation has
arisen. In the second half of the 18th century, as
we know from contemporary diarists and memoir-
writers, the tradition of the Virtuous Girl was prac-
tically non-existent. Most of the royalties made no
pretence of either morality or sobriety; statesmen
like Fox, soldiers like Wellington, sailors like
Nelson, supported mistresses as a matter of course,
and so it went on right down the social scale. The
Victorian epoch produced the “bread-and-butter
miss,” a cloistered, simpering creature who, what-
ever her unregenerate inclinations, was given small
chance of gratifying them. And the nation’s family
life became a good deal more regular than it had
been under any of the Georges. The war has given
us a new type—the unmarried girl and young-to-
elderly married women who demand the license of
the ISth century' with the moral prestige of the 19tli
century.
For half-a-dozen years or more some millions of
pleasure-loving young women have been putting up,
with a large measure of success, one of the most
impudent bluffs in history. They 'say in effect:
“Of course, we act in a manner that seems odd to
you, with your evil pre-war mind. We are ready'
to admit that some of our little stunts would have
surprised, if not shocked, 1 even the 18th century.
But there’s no harm in us. We are human beings
of the 1923 model, guaranteed as frigid as Diana or
as chaste as St. Anthony, as the case may be, under
all possible circumstances." This was the defence
advanced the other day in a London Divorce Court
by Mrs. John Hugo Russell, who married Lord
Ampthill's heir in 1918, and who, according to all
the pre-war rules, has been committing adultery ever
since. Her explanation of days and nights spent
with other men ; of visits to flats during which the
servants had orders to admit no one; of “outings
with dozens of men”—motoring outings, dinner out-
ings, dance outings—was that the men meant
nothing to her and she meant nothing to them. She
was sexually cold, and so were they.
It may seem strange to some that the husband
should have believed this bunkum; but there is not
the slightest doubt thiit she was cold so far as lie
was concerned. That sort of wife is usually indif-
ferent to the point of hostility where her husband
is < oncerned —from which we get the axiom: “The
AN OBSTINATE CASE.
STAGE-MANAGER ARCHBISHOP LEES : “If you can’t faith-heal his hump, for goodness sake
produce a white rabbit or a bowl of goldfish out of his ear—the audience is
getting restive!”
husband is always the last to suspect.” The unhappy
Russell’s memories of one rebuff after another
probably made it easy for him to believe that the
lady was as icy to others as she always had been to
him. Fortunately for the cause of justice, this plea
did not go down with a level-headed judge and jury;
and at a cost of £25,000 —-a sum which Lord
Ampthill told the Court represented his family’s
ruin—-the youthful husband is now free.
A wise old judge—one who was neither a Puritan
nor a libertine, and who had watched society with
impartial attentiveness for half-a-century—once said
to me: “When I see an attractive woman avoiding
her husband for other women, for sport or for poli-
tics, I suspect he has been misconducting himself;
when I see her avoiding him for other men, or one
man, I know she is misconducting herself.” And
on the subject of Platonic friendships: “As you go
through life you will notice that the young married
people of opposite sexes who, on their behavior and
known character, might be expected to be capable
of Platonic friendships, rarely, if ever, attempt them.
The friendships that one is asked to accept as
Platonic are almost always between ladies who have
caused scandal for years, and men who make no
claim to a high moral standard.” The average citi-
zen is not distressed at the spectacle of people
enjoying themselves in an illicit manner. He would
ask for no greater privilege, probably, than the right
to move in a set comparable to the “infamous Whig
Society” of the beginning of last century. The jus-
tification of the Foxes, Palmerstons, Melbournes,
Bessboroughs, Byrons, etc., was that, in addition to
being a brilliant lot, they did not cant or lie. The
chief offence of our equally loose-living and incom-
parably less intelligent post-war sinners is that
they do both. It is axiomatic that St. Cecilias
never, in any age, dress, drink, dance, smoke, swear
or flirt like Rahabs. But the shrill insistence ot
the modern Rahab that, though she does all these
things, she is really a St. Cecilia, causes many to
accept' the proposition for the sake of a quiet life.
Or, anyhow, they accept the patent absurdity till
they are put on their oaths in a jury box.
W. Green, of Tamworth, isn’t satisfied yet
that New States are wanted. He puts these
points:—
(1) I have lived 30 years in Tamworth. To me
the knowledge that it was not progressing has been
a great disappointment. 1 have often asked myself
why the stagnation? The primary cause is climatic.
For years now we have been cursed by wretched
seasons. This has reacted on the towns—business
has languished and progress stopped. The system of
government has nothing to do with their decay.
(2) The fact that Maoriland and Tasmania and
other portions of Australia separated in the early
days is no reason why N. S. Wales should cut
itself up into a series of petty little States to-day.
Any progress that the States you quote have made
is mainly the result of geographical and economic
conditions.
(3) Your comparison between the line from the
coast to Katoomba and a possible line from the
coast to Armidale is unfortunate. Kempsey, on the
Macleay, is the nearest ccastal point to Armidale.
The Macleay at its entrance is one of the most
treacherous rivers on the coast. It even has the
unfortunate habit of changing its outlet to the
ocean. If Kempsey had been blessed by nature with
a Port Jackson in which the navies of the world
could anchor, and had her population as the result
of nature’s bounty been three-quarters of a million
instead of a few thousands, no doubt it would have
been a payable proposition to surmount the engi-
neering difficulties and construct a line to Armidale.
(4) You seem to infer that sufficient extent of
territory is enough reason for the creation of new
States. Is not population a more important factor ?
If it is so, then England is a suitable country in
which the New-State idea should be tried, yet some-
how they seem to get on Very well as one people.
(5) The last paragraph of your comment is an
excellent argument for the county-council system:
“And as the powers of Queensland’s county councils
were altered or enlarged or diminished seven times
in 18 years they are hardly worth calling powers.”
This shows that the system is elastic and can be
amended and improved when occasion demands. In
opposition to this easy method of procedure think
of a hard and fast brand-new Constitution, un-
changeable, that would control a new State. The
old evil of centralisation would start over again.
All local work instead of being referred to a local
council on the spot would be referred to the capital,
possibly hundreds of miles away. We in Tamworth
would rather be bossed by the people in Sydney
than the people, say, in Grafton.
On which The Bulletin remarks in a few
words: —
(I). Yet Sydney, which lives on the distressful
country, has just doubled in 20 years.
(2) The geographical conditions of Queensland are
much the same as those of the Northern Territory.
As a separate State Queensland has made vast pro-
gress in 40 years. The N.T. has made none at all.
(3) Kempsey is not the only place on the coast.
It wasn’t found impossible to bring a railway from
the hinterland to Sydney over the mountains. It
has been found impossible to bring a railway over
the coastal range to any other port—from Eden to
Tweed Heads.
(4) The Bulletin does infer that “sufficient ex-
tent of territory” is reason enough for the creation
of new States, provided the country isn’t quite a
desert. This paper wouldn’t hire a Broken Hill
man, who didn’t know Sydney, and wouldn’t come
to Sydney, to run its Sydney business. Neither
would Mr. Green.
(5) Beautiful “elasticity” means also that nobody
will advance a bean for necessary works construc-
tion. “Unchangeable” titles are not such bad
things. Mr. Green probably prefers to have his home
built on a freehold instead of an “elastic” lease.
The Commonwealth Taxation Department,
which costs just on £600,000 p.a. to run, and
is forever complaining of being understaffed,
has had poor luck with its lawsuits. Last
week it crashed thunderously in the High
Court. Under a regulation made in 1918
the Department has fixed what it calls “fair
average values according to State boun-
daries” in assessing a pastoralisCs income
from his stock. The values, of course, are
determined by city bureaucrats, with the re-
sult that in the latest lot of assessments
cattle are reckoned to be worth £3 a. head in
Queensland and the Speck, £4 10s. in West-
ralia, £5 in S.A. and £6 in the other States;
sheep are 9s. a head in Queensland, 12s. in
W.A., 12s. 6d. in Victoria and 10s. in the
other States; and horses vary from £4 in
Queensland to £8 in N. S. Wales and £l5
in Victoria and the Speck. Also, a pig at
Merbein, on the Victorian side of the Mur-
ray, is alleged to be 150 p.c. more valuable
than his relative on the N.S.W. bank. For
years farmers and graziers have protested
that the departmental values were mon-
strously high (they were dropped a bit last
year), and contained grotesque discrepancies,
but it was reserved for Donald Norman
Cameron, of the Speck, doughty fighter of
early Federal days, to test the legality of
the business. He was signally successful.
Five High Court Judges pronounced the re-
gulation unconstitutional on the ground that
it discriminates between States. Not only
does it contravene sections 51 (11) and 89 of
the Constitution, but, leaving State boun-
daries out of the argument, the Department
has no authority for assessing a man’s in-
come on what it calls “fair average values.”
It is bound to arrive at actual, not aver-
age, values. That is the view of Justice
Isaacs, a careful man. No doubt, the usual
army of temporary hands will have to be
engaged to reassess the botched assessments,
and the refunds will perhaps run into hun-
dreds of thousands of pounds. But no one
is likely to lose his job for rushing the Com-
monwealth into the blastiferous mess. That
sort of thing is never done in this quaint
land of duplicated departments.
Tasmania may have strained its credit
pretty badly to raise the money for its gigantic
hydro-electric scheme, but at least that
scheme is a compact business idea for supply-
ing cheap power over a wide area, and not a
mere dribbling out of money in scattered
vote-catching jobs. And it has really been
done, while the Clarence and Snowy rivers
projects of N. S. Wales balance in the air,
like the Sydney harbor bridge. The little
isle used to lie under the stigma of being a
conservative place, and out of the track of
Progress. Unfortunately in some of the big
States the movement that had been Progress
fell into the hands of boodlers, Tammany
bosses, “uncouth crooks,” plain thieves and
violent Communists, with disastrous results
on plain industry. As late as 1917 Queens-
land stood first among the five copper States,
and represented nearly half the Common-
wealth’s output, while Tasmania was third,
the value of its copper crop being £1,360,000
behind that of the northern giant. In 1921
(complete copper figures stop there) Tas-
mania was the biggest producer and Queens-
land was the smallest, the positions being so
completely reversed that the little State was
£276,000 ahead of the demoralised colossus,
and had taken its place as the State which
supplied half the total output. From being
responsible for nearly 16 per cent, of the
Commonwealth’s mineral output in 1917,
Queensland dropped to under 6 per cent, in
1921, and except in the N. Territory, which
took the disease from Queensland, there was
no fall like it. Queensland certainly did some
climbing, for it rose, by the end of 1922, to
have the biggest percentage of unemployed
among the six States, while Tasmania had
the second lowest; and Queensland, measured
by the amount of debt per head, was the
second worst, while Tasmania was only
fourth. Tasmania inspires a qualified re-
spect these days, and in comparison with
its biggest neighbors it threatens to be a
Shining Light.

POLITICAL
POINTS
It is moodily suspected in Queensland that
the real reason why the Labor Government
is speeding to the country, six months before
its time, is that the loan money has given
out, as it did in 1920, when, as Theodore
confided to the recent party Convention, “the
finances were absolutely exhausted.” Lon-
don refuses to lend to a Government that has
repudiated its contracts with British com-
panies, and the improvement in the pound
sterling has made dollar loans frightfully
costly. The last—lo million dollars at _6
p.c.; price of i-sue, 96^ —was floated in
February, 1922. a: J judging by De Garis’s
heartbreaking experience and by frigid com-
ments in U.S. newspapers (one of them re-
marked recently that “Australia has borrowed
almost to the capacity of its population”), it
will be hard to get another on any terms
short of calculated brigandage. The Govern-
ment —any Government —can scrape along
for six weeks: but if it had to carry
on for six months with the loan funds all
spent and no prospect of replenishing them
before the day of wrath, it would have to
sack thousands of Government employees.
And that, in a country where battalions of
unionists are unemployed already, would
destroy it beyond repair.
Concerning the European cobweb: —
Judging by last week’s improvement in most
European paper money measured by English ster-
ling, there is a better prospect of straightening
out the Franco-German tangle. Two things will
have to be done more or less simultaneously—the
fixing of the reparations that Germany can pay; the
stabilising of the mark. How much gold Germany
has nobody knows. The Reichsbank’s reserves are
only about £60,000,000; but the people, though
they are supposed to have handed in their gold,
have probably held on to quite twice as much.
However, that won’t go far in paying two or three
thousand millions. But the wealth is in the
country; and most of it can be used as security
for payment. If the mark is stabilised by law,
say at 50,000 to the £, it means that the hundreds
of millions of internal debt will be almost wiped
out; the Germans who had lent their country
£5,600,000,000 would find that it now owed them
only £2,240,000. It is commonly said that Ger-
many has made hundreds of millions by deliberately
depreciating the exchange value of its mark. In
one way it has; on the other hand individual
Germans, who paid hard cash for German loans,
have lost hundreds of millions. Also landholders
whose properties were mortgaged will find, if the
mark is established by law at, say, 50,000 to the
£ instead of the old 20, that they have been
relieved of most of their debt —at the expense, of
course, of the mortgagor, who is mostly another
German. But the point of interest to the nations
to which Germany owes reparations is this: on
being relieved of all this vast internal debt, the
security is available to carry new debt —the rail-
ways, for instance, many of the industries, and most
of the lands. And payment of instalments will be
approximately as easy as payment of the old
interest was. •
Many members of the Vic. Farmers’ Con-
ference in Melbourne last week made up
their minds to hammer Earle Page for secur-
ing a working alliance with Bruce. And dur-
ing the debate there were so many dark
references to the Flinders-lane influence and
to certain discredited Nationalists that a
vote of censure against the Cocky “managers”
seemed in danger of uproarious support.
Then Page appeared with his cherubic smJe
and a masterly pretence of offended dignity
which soon had a lot of the recalcitrants
wilting in their decision to attack him. Gib-
son, the P.M.G., and Stewart, the new
Works and Railways, added their quota of
indignation, and soon the meeting burst into
a unanimous cheer and the three Ministers
went away blushing. It was an unexpected
triumph, as striking in its way as Marc
Antony’s handling of the hostile Roman
mob.

DODLRY : “Nay, nay, sweet sir. I am the executioner .”
There is said to be a chance of the great
Wyndham meatworks re-opening this year,
but not much chance. The works were built
with Westralian loan money; but they failed
miserably and closed dismally. Of Darwin
and its surroundings the Administrator re-
ported the other day that industry _ had
ceased, production stopped, capital vanished
and ships left off calling. The North Queens-
land copper industry is also almost dead:
only Chillagoe is kept open with Government
money, else the local member, Theodore by
name, would have no constituents left. Dar-
win is 3010 miles by mail route from the
place which bungles its affairs; Wyndham
is 2177 miles ard Clonoiirrv 1050 mfies Fri >m
the wise men who steer their destinies. Inci-
dentally, Broken Hill, which is threatened
with another strike, is 1396 miles by the only
civilised route from the place where its
interests are attended to. The constitutional
rulers being, by reason of the mania for
bloated States, too far away to count, local
Labor bosses take charge, and whether the
scene is far north or far south the result is
the same.
George Fuller is in England on an infor-
mal cadge. Speaking on the importation of
immigrants from the Cold Country, he said:
One of the main objects of his mission was to
induce the authorities in England to contribute to
the N.S.W. scheme one-third of the interest for the
first five years. The English contribution would
probably not exceed *.150,000 a year.
By way of comment these points are sub-
mitted :
(1) Britain is taxing itself about £2O 9s. per
inhabitant per year, and is paying off its war debt
to Uncle Shylock. N.S.W. pays about £l2 10s.
per head, in Federal and State imposts, and it bor-
rows a lot from the Old Man in London as well. It
might let up on begging from him.
(2) N.S.W. is blessed with £700,000 a year more
land revenue than Victoria, South Aus., Westralia
and Tasmania combined. With this handsome endow-
ment it should need still less to borrow or cadge.
(3) By the transfer of population Britain loses
taxpayers while N.S.W. gains them. That should
be enough without whining for a subsidy along
with the taxpayers.
Did our Fullers never hear of independence,
self-reliance and the other virtues that dif-
ferentiate a man from a lapdog?
If the truculent A.L.P. executive finds
that it inflated itself an inch too much when
it claimed the right to nominate new party
leaders and future Premiers in addition to
expelling old ones, it may remember that
it didn’t lack precedent to warn it. An
equally bumptious body, which had bumped
for something like 1000 years, the British
House qf Lords to wit, burst quite as badly,
though with less “blanky,” in 1911. Two
years earlier it had thrown out the Budget
once too often, and the boil-over happened.
Now the Peers may reject a money bill if
they like, but it passes just the same. In
fact, it is only shown to them as a matter
of courtesy, in the same way that a red flag
may be shown to a bull. Other measures
they may delay for a short time only. The
Peers were told that, if they didn’t pass the
bill abolishing their veto, 700 new Lords
would be created, if necessary, to put it
through, and even if the new nobles were a
rough lot, they and their descendants would
be there for good. Then the old nobility
kicked itself gloomily for not knowing when
to stop, and caved in.
“I wish to make the statement that I am
to-day probably the most popular Labor
man in N.S.W. with the portion of the Labor
movement that counts.” Thus Gregory
McGirr, last April, when the post-election
storm of recrimination was just beginning
among the party that had been defeated and
dispossessed of office. If Gregory had only
put the word “out” at the end of the sen-
tence, it would have been a prophetic utter-
ance.
In one respect Uncle Sam’s foreign policy
has been a model of firmness and good sense.
He has steadfastly refused to recognise the
thieving Red Republic until it (1) ceases to
stir up strife in other countries, and (2)
promises to pay its debts. State Secretary
Hughes recalled last week that, after the
first revolution in 1917, his country lent the
then Russian Government 187,000,000 dol-
lars. When the Bolshevists arrived they
not only repudiated this loan, but applied
some of the proceeds to financing an attempt
to overturn the lender’s institutions, with
the usual accompaniments of murder, rob-
bery and rape. Uncle hit back by deporting
every foreign incendiary he could lay his
hands on, and casting American-born ruffians
into gaol. Had Australia been equally reso-
lute it wouldn’t be annually humiliated by
the spectacle of imported agitators rushing
to Moscow to get instructions for the next
lot of irritation strikes, and boasting that
they had tlje Labor party “in the bag.”
For 82 years Sydney has had an average
annual rainfall of 48in., which is 25in. more
than London—and lOin. more than the Big
Fog had in the wettest year in its recorded
history—2B more than Copenhagen, 20
more than Constantinople, 26 more than
Paris, and, 27 more than Petrograd. More-
over, behind it is a range of mountains
where the rainfall is often heavier than it is
even in Sydney. Yet hardly a year passes
without the metropolitan area being put on
water rations: at the moment no hoses or
sprinklers may be used, and the scores of
Diggers who have gone in for market-garden-
ing are told that they can do what the
Chinese do—carry the moisture round in
buckets. The whole trouble arises from
divided responsibility. The supply is a
shuttlecock between the Government and the
Water and Sewerage Board. When one is
attacked it throws the blame on the other.
The Board can’t raise any money: it is
entirely dependent on what the Government
furnishes. It can only fold its hands and
draw its fees —and sentence struggling
market-gardeners and others to ruin. Of
course it knows that the position is rotten,
and it should have thrown up its job long-
ago and brought matters to a head. The
position disgraces both bodies—Board and
Government alike.
N.S.W. Labor’s half-leader McGirr woke
from a trance the other day to remember
that his party began to collect money with
which to start a daily paper 16 years ago,
and promised to refund subscriptions in four
years (12 years ago, that is) if the organ
didn’t appear. “Imagine the position.” said
Greg., “if a private company had collected
£lOO,OOO 16 years ago, and made no attempt
to carry out the project!” There would be
no position to imagine. The sentences,
whether the matter was called breach of
trust, misappropriation, larceny as a bailee
or just false pretences, would have expired
two or three years ago.
As the Vic. Cocky conference has be-
stowed its blessing on the Bruee-Pages, the
State Parliamentary group feels free to negoti-
ate or listen to suggestions for shifting (or
altering) the Lawson team, which has had a
five years’ innings. Nothing will be done worth
talking about for three months. Much as they
may like Lawson, McPherson and Peacock, the
other five Assembly Ministers are not pre-
pared to go out ignominiously to keep that
trinity in office with others. The five would
rather sink in company with the Three.
Provided an acceptable leader (say, one as
well qualified as Speaker Mackey) can be
found among the Liberals, the rump of the
Lawson following will approach John Allan
and co. in July with a Guy Fawkes proposi-
tion. The Cockies will be in a position to
enforce terms almost as good as Page got.
Quite likely a lot of lies have been told
about the state of things in Russia under
Bolshevism, but there are some official statis-
tics that anyhow can be trusted not to exag-
gerate the chaos. Recently there was a con-
ference of the local trade associations at
Petersburg (the pro-Russian German paper
from which the figures are taken doesn’t call
it Petrograd, by the way), and thereat it was
reported that only 307 out of 940 large in-
dustrial concerns were doing any work at
all. During the first half of 1922, 146
undertakings of the metal industry gave 24
p.c. of pre-war production. Of ioO blast-
furnaces only 15 are at work, and the output
is 2 p.c. of pre-war times; and in the electro-
technical industry the present output is only
12J p.c. of what it was in the days before
the country took to loving its neighbor so
much that it first robbed and then murdered
him —if it couldn’t manage to do the two
things simultaneously.
The Vic. Cocky conference declared in
favor of compulsory voting at Federal and
State elections. Which recalls that Dun-
stan, M.L.A. for Eaglehawk, who supported
the motion, voted against and helped to de-
feat Labor-man Cotter’s Compulsory Voting
Bill in the Vic. Assembly last October. The
Uppah Chambah also threw out Williams’s
measure, which came on three weeks after
Cotter’s was cooked. Perhaps the conference
intended its resolution as a delicate hint that
something good can occasionally emanate
from Labor, and that party slavishness may
be carried too far.
AJAX!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Senator Gardiner has gently intimated to the
A.L.P. executive (Sydney) that it is a ridiculous and
contemptible body, reeking with turpitude and
malignity, and that he despises its methods and scorns
its threats.”
They’re cleaning up the Labor shop before the winter
sales ;
See, “rank by rank they soap the plank and clatter
with the pails.”
They do not whistle at their job, these comrades
staunch of yore,
But savagely they howl and sob for one another’s
gore.
The lurid epithets that fly are worse than any that
Were ever hurled in days gone by at Boodle or at
Fat.
And in between the scrubbing and the whitening
The split is widening and the barrier height’ning,
But the limit men can reach
In uncompromising speech
Is registered when “Jupp” defies the lightning.
There’s twenty-one in Dooley’s gang, sixteen or so
in Greg’s,
Their brooms intrude, their buckets clang, ’twixt
one another’s legs.
Some have a foot in either camp, or seek to keep
one there,
The while the leaders rave and ramp, in rhetoric
rich and rare.
They’re cleaning up the Labor shop! ’Tis easy to
be seen
One mob will have to be atop before they get it
clean.
But the Dooleyites must feel their outlook bright’-
ning
And their grip upon the situation tight’ning
When the Senatorial “Jupp”
Leaps heroically up
To defy the Powell-Carey brand of lightning.
’Twould set the feeblest pulse astir and fire the
sluggard’s blood
When in the midriff of McGirr the fists of Dooley
thud.
And one O’Halloran there is who wags a biting
tongue
When gibes that tear are in the air or flouts that
sear are flung.
Beside their nectar (.or their beer) the “heads” .in
conclave sit
And hurl their bolts at rebel dolts to demonstrate
they’re it.
And some there are who find the menace fright’ning,
But to one at least it’s heartening and right’ning,
He learns without regret
By Macdonell House he’s set —
What a cinch for a cartoonist 1. What a
theme for a vignette,
“Jupp” crowing a defiance at the lightning.

Commonwealth General Assurance
Corporation, Ltd. (Sydney), which pre-
sented 10,000 fully-paid 10s. shares to the
promoter. The deficit of £8043 with which
the co. began included £3OO of preliminary
exes, and £3574 brokerage on shares. The

The £25,144 deficit is the excess of outgoings
over income since incorporation, and, less
£440 of share premiums, is the portion of
the £G9,GBG of paid capital (including calls
paid in advance) which has only intangible
assets —an organisation and insurances
which some day are expected to be pay-
able —to represent it. In the balance-sheet
the establishment account is shown at
£20,028, but it was written up to that figure
so that book reserves of £3884 (Life, £1078;
Fire, etc., £2BOG) could be shown. The
difference between book reserves and the
establishment account is the deficit in the
table. These additional comparisons are

They are not worth much. For the past
year £1321 of interest earnings and £2412
of general administrative costs —both items
are shown in a separate “general revenue
account” —cannot be correctly apportioned.
Also there was an addition of £5113 to the
establishment account which did not go
through revenue accounts and was an addi-
tional charge on the period. In the introduc-
tory table it has been so included.
“Wonderful record,” “remarkable suc-
cess,” "every department producing splendid
results,” “solid as the massive South Head,”
“unbreakable as Australian steel” —these are
a few enthusiastic outbursts in the first issue
of a little C.G.A.-staff periodical. In a
lecture on “service” the management exhorts
the staff “to quit theorising and mooning and
groping in the dark and get down to hard
facts.” Well, here are a few hard facts
(1) In two years all the income—premiums and
interest earnings (totalling £65,342) —and £2545
besides, was spent to get and hold the business on
the books at December 31. That does not include
the £8943 of preliminary costs or take into ac-
count £13,656 of losses.
(2) The true position of any one department can-
not be ascertained owing to (a) the unexplained
additions to the establishment account, and ( b )
the charging of administrative expenses (£2412)
against interest, etc. (only £1321), in the general
revenue account. These happenings discount the
value of departmental accounts, wherein it is
claimed that Ordinary operations are already show-
ing - a surplus.
(3) The Ordinary department accounts show
£15,289 of expenses set against £17,245 of pre-
miums, an expense rate of nearly 88 p.c. Allowing
10 p.c. as a reasonable charge for handling the
£4954 of renewal premiums, then the £12,291 of
first premiums from new business took £14,794
(=l2O p.c.). That is certainly a lower rate than
many young offices are showing, but does it fully
represent actual all-in costs of the C.G.A.’s new
business ?
(4) “Great care in the selection of risks is being
exercised,” the management declares. “Ordinary
branch claims paid total less than £l5OO, the new
business completed totalling £527,696. The claim
ratio is therefore under 1 p.c. of the business com-
pleted.” How much of that £527,696 of assur-
ance written is still live business? During the first
year 896 policies giving an annual income of £9981
were written. For the past 12 months renewal pre-
miums amounted to only £4954.
(5) Though the balance-sheet shows an Ordinary
assurance fund of £lO7B, it is merely a book
reserve.
(6) Last year the Industrial branch spent £13,806
to get £7099 of premiums—an expense rate of
194 p.c. In this instance, also, perhaps expenses
should include portion of the general administra-
tion and Establishment charges. The 12 months
closed with a deficit of £7536, to which something
has to be added in respect of the small volume of
business handled in the previous year.
(7) This is the concern which recently acquired
the whole of the Life Insurance Co.’s Industrial
business. It received no funds and paid £6223 cash
for policies on which an actuarial liability of
approximately £lB,OOO existed. The L.C.A. is jubi-
lant over the deal. The C.G.A. regards it as a “good
investment.” The Sydney eo., which secures a ready-
made business in Melbourne in this way, must make
future premiums from the transferred business over-
take the £24,000 or so deficit incurred in the pur-
chase, and not for many years can hopes be enter-
tained of its own expensive business becoming actu-
arially sound. In this department at least £32,000
of capital is required to cover deficits and policy-
liabilities.
(6; Fire, accident and marine business is giving
surpluses. Last year £36,543 of premiums were
collected, but no less than £16,386 went in re-
insurances. Whether other offices are reciprocating
is not stated. So far this branch has accumulated
£2352 of reserves. But that is not profit. On the
basis of 40 p.c. of any year’s net premiums being
required for unexpired risks, at December 31 £BOOO
or so should have been in reserve. Capital is back-
ing a large portion of risks under policies. Funds
14 times net premiums are regarded as fair protec-
tion for policy-holders, so this department should
have the support of £30,000 or so of capital.
There has so far been nothing to justify
some of the extravagant terms in which the
C.G.A. talks about itself. It has certainly
been a speedy youngster. Its future, how-
ever, depends on whether it retains its costly
business, and on cutting expenses so that
premiums will, within a reasonable period,
do the work for which they were designed.
So far £25,000 of shareholders’ funds, have
gone in excess expenses and cost of estab-
lishment. Not quite £45,000 of shareholders’
funds were in realisable assets at December
31. At that date approximately £30,000 was
required to give more or less assured backing
to general-insurance poflcy-holders; in the
Industrial branch there was a policy-liability
of more than £lB,OOO, and also a small actu-
arial liability under Ordinary policies. There
was? also £6223 to be paid to the L.C.A. These
figures tell plainly that the co. could not
with safetv continue extensions of business
at heavy cost without the support of addi-
tional capital. An issue of 80,000 shares is
at present being offered in Vic. Certainly,
at the balancing date, there was £69,456
callable on existing shares. But forfeitures
(£321) and calls in arrears (£2644) already
figure in the accounts. Under the most
favorable conditions the C.G.A. has a long
way to go before it can become a success, of
no remarkable degree, as a life and general
underwriter. The prospects of divs. are far
distant: particularly for the 129,677 of ordi-
naries, who rank after 74,818 of first prefs.
and 73,063 of second prefs., the former alone
piling up a tidy liability with their cumula-
tive 7 p.c. p.a. Yet, life flotations being the
public fancy of the moment, a new issue of
10s. shares to be paid to ss. has been selling
in N. S. Wales and S. Aus. at a premium of
2s. 6d.!

“Services have been maintained without
serious interruption during the year,” says
the directors’ report, “but the conditions of
trade have not shown improvement and do
not warrant resumption of the full services
existing prior to the war.” Nevertheless,
the div. rate has advanced a point to 15 p.c.,
and as much as was distributed visibly goes
to reserves. Just prior to the war the co.
was struggling to pay from 5 p.c. to 7 p.c.
on the same amount of ordinary capital. It
is an astonishing performance when you
take into account the prevailing depression
on the coast and the smaller -tonnage in the
fleet. Of course, the sale of vessels during
the boom period gave large funds which are
in public securities and turning in a tidy
income. The co. is nowadays heavily inter-
ested in the coal trade: it has a controlling
interest in the Metropolitan Colliery (BulU
seam), and a big holding in the Hebburn, on
the Maitland field. The colliery cos. have
been having a great run, and Huddart-
Parker’s recent handsome profits have pro-
bably been accounted for in part by its coal
connections. The directors don’t, however,
admit to anything like £'ZQS,Z43. Net pro-
fits, according to their reckoning, amounted
to £113.388, which was only £B3BB more than
was taken by divs. But £29,378 net addi-
tions to the insurance fund can also be re-
garded as profit actually earned, making
£142,766 in all. Besides, £62,477 went
into general reserves, being “the surplus on
sale of assets and balances available on
settlement of certain adjustment accounts.”
Even that £205,243 may not have been
the full extent to which the co. improved
its position as a result of the year’s happen-
ings. There is another big reservoir in
which surpluses have been hoarded, and
additions to it have not been taken into
account in the introductory table. One way
and another this reserve for “contingencies,
taxation, depreciation of property and in-
vestments, repairs and maintenance, boilers
and renewals, superannuation fund, etc.,” has
expanded from £30,000-odd in 1913 to
£358,000 at the latest balance: —

How much, if anything, of the £34,044 net
additions last year can be regarded as profit
only those inside can tell. It is positively
certain, however, that whatever contingen-
cies do require cover, that mammoth reserve
—4l p.c. of the book value of ail fixed assets,
including share interests in collieries, etc.
—holds a substantial accumulation of pro-
fit. Here is another view of Iluddart-
I’arker progress:—
1915. 1921. 1922.
Assets apart from
fixed assets .. £348,517 £1,628,689 £1,652,464
Liabilities.. .. 93,291 335,793 313,058
Surplus liquid assets £255,226 £1,292,896 £1,339,406
Capital is a million, half in 6 p.c. prefs. and
the balance in ordinaries. An amount one-
third as large again as total naid capital is
represented by the surplus of Government
securities, stocks, stores, book debts and
cash over and above liabilities. Seven years’
additions to this liquid surplus alone exceed
capital by £84,000-odd.
This great strength is accounted for by
war earnings, the sale of assets when values
were at their highest, profits thereon, insur-
ances from lost tonnages during the war,
and the fact that to date shareholders have
had very little of the harvest, notwithstand-
ing their fat divs. lately. The directors
have now decided that shareholders should
have portion of the vast accumulations of
profit represented by scrip. Their scheme
is a very mild one. They propose to tap
only a quarter-million of reserves, which will
give a one-in-two bonus issue, and even then
the whole of paid capital w r ill be represented
by liquid assets until such time as the direc-
tors decide to add to the fleet or finance addi-
tional colliery or other enterprises. The
co.’s position in all respects is very snug,
and the prospects of profits for ordinaries
are bright. They have a half-million of
cheap pref.. capital, £550,000 of acknowledged
reserves, and £350,000 of other visiole re-
serves, which are probably also mostly true
reserves, to help earn divs. on their £750,000.
Total funds have to earn only 5 p.c. net to
give prefs. 6 p.c. and ordinaries 10 p.c.

Once in each year this tobacco co.—paid
capital £7,179,299 —presents a report and
accounts, which, excepting for disclosures of
minor movements in figures, are replicas of
those that have gone before. Divs. of 6 p.c.
on prefs. and 12 p.c. on ordinaries are a
regular habit, and just a trifle of surplus
profit is always shown to assure proprietors
that those distributions are really earned.
No attempt is made to disclose actual net
profits of the huge business: the directors’
reports never fail to announce that the
“figures do not include the co.’s interest in
the undivided profits of the subsidiary cos.”
Two years ago shareholders had very prac-
tical proof of the existence of subsidiary re-
serves : they received one bonus share for
every eight held, and that issue was paid by
a special div. of £628,591 disgorged by the
original cos. whose shares this one .now holds.
The outsider never gets a glimpse of their
affairs. Something more than the figures shown
in the introductory table are brought in each
year. “Direct net profits and divs.” for the
past three years have been: 1921, £610,139;
1922, £789.817; 1923, £792,831. The co.
was one of the first to run an employees’
profit-sharing scheme, and £27,160, £38,445
and £19,630 have gone to trustees to pur-
chase employees’ shares during the three
years.
The published balance-sheet is a very ab-
breviated affair. Assets are in three cos.
groups: shares in subsidiary cos. (booh
value), £5,389.061; debtors and debit balances,
£1,803,003; cash, £989 i. On the other side
there are creditors and credit balances for
£52,544. Everything of any importance is
splendidly hidden, and shareholders are quite
content to leave well alone. Why worry
when your shareholding of two years ago is
returning p.c. p.a. in regular quarterly
morsels? No doubt recent conditions have
been favorable for the big concern : costs have
lightened in several directions, and there is
now no price-fixing body to dictate what
shall be charged for the “necessary com-
modity.”

Australian Federal Life and General
Assurance Co., Ltd.—The promoter —V. A.
C. Partridge, who, it is claimed, has had a
“brilliant career” with “one of the most pro-
gressive cos.” (unnamed) —parades the “re-
markable development” of the Australian Pro-
vincial and the “remarkable prosperity” of
the Southern Cross to justify his float.
The former co.’s business-growth is described
as “rather startling”—so, also, were some
of the results. Evidence of the prosperity of
the latter is “the purchase of one of the
most palatial buildings in Melbourne” and
the disposal of 100,000 shares in M.L. at a
premium of ss. per share. Perhaps these
statements are presented with a knowledge
that the public is mostly quite ignorant of
what constitutes prosperity in insurance, but
to say the 'least they are astonishing things to
come from a life-man who should know
better. Except for the announcement that
“all premium rates will be actuarially cal-
culated,” nowhere in the prospectus is there
a suggestion to intending subscribers of the
necessity for conducting operations on a
sound basis. “Big business” is the key-
note throughout. The co. is expected to
“rapidly develop into a profit-earning con-
cern to both shareholders and policy-holders.”
Nominal capital is £300,000 in 600,000
shares of 10s. each, but only 200,000 are to
be issued for a start. From the beginning the
venture is to be loaded with 100,000 fully-paid
prefs., carrying 8 p.c. cumulative, a charge
of £4OOO p.a., which cannot be met for many
years even under the best of conditions. The
other 100,000 are ordinaries which are to
be called to ss. on allotment. The pro-
moter collars 20,000 gift prefs. and £lOOO
cash for his flotation services and for under-
taking to pay preliminary expenses.

This co., which runs markets in Adelaide,
began nearly 50 years ago. Capital is
£33,125 in 10,000 £5 shares paid to 665. 3d.
each, and for the past year divs. totalling
6s. 6d. were paid, which gave slightly less
than 10 p.c. Possibly the enterprise means
more to some shareholders who also take
advantage of the facilities offered by the
markets for the sale of their produce. Profits
in the table are erratic, but half-yearly re-
sults are affected a good deal by taxation
payments. The co. is living well up to its
earnings, though: paid capital is supported
by only £1364 of reserves. In 10 years
balance-sheet figures have moved in this
way:— ■
1912. 1922.
Liabilities .. ..£17,000 £14,000
Liquid assets .. 1,779 2,213
Excess liabilities ..£15,221 £11,787
Extracting the latest div. the co. showed
£234 of cash and book debts of £479. Apart
from the mortgage, the co. owed nothing.
But at December 31 the liquid position had
shown an improvement of not quite £3500 in
10 years. The book value of properties
(freeholds) had meantime declined from

Choiseul Plantations, Ltd. —This co.
closed its twelfth year on November 30 last
with £135,769 sunk in five estates totalling
6552 acres under cocoanuts. The planta-
tions are in the ex-German Solomons, and, in-
cluding the areas bet aside for native foods,
etc., the co. has developed to the limit of its
concessions. Shareholders have now to
await the maturing of plantings, and hope
for payable copra prices to reward their
enterprise. Copra production has been as
follows: 19.19, 60 tons; 1920, 211 tons; 1921,
546 tons; 1922, 746 tons. For the current
year an output of 1000 tons is expected if
everything continues to go well at the planta-
tions. Better prices have been offering lately,
and if they are maintained ChoiseuPs affairs
may be expected to take a turn. So far
shareholders have put up £144,805, but de-
velopment and equipment—there’s £4779 in
shipping property and £9641 in live stock—

The light weight of Pioneer Wood Pipe speeds
the water-main construction. This is an important
consideration in Australia, where railways are few
and expanses wide. Wood Pipe weighs only about
one-third as much as metal or concrete pipe—one
railway truck can carry ( a large supply. But its
advantages in transport handling and laying are
even more important. The fact that it remains
smooth inside, never diminishes in capacity, pre-
serves the purity of the water and never pits nor
corrodes recommends it to far-seeing engineers. The

Wallaroo and Moonta had Sll men at
work at the close of 1922 under modified
wages. Copper for the half-year averaged
only £63 4s. a ton, or £5 per ton less than
in 1921, so it took pluck to re-open the
mines towards the end of September. But
operating in an adverse market is appa-
rently better than to allow old, deep mines to
lie idle. To December 31 only 3023 tons of
sorted ore and 41 tons rich precipitates went
to the smelter. These, with purchased ore,
yielded 517 tons refined metal. During the
half-year the co. also sold 276 tons copper
stocks. The liquid position drifted in this
way:—

The. co. converted £83,000 of S. Aus.
Treasury deposits into cash • to get its
overdraft down and to assist mine
operations. So far work is proceeding
on a small scale, but better copper
prices are now helping. In the Wallaroo 4
p.c. ore was broken at Young’s shaft from
the 2670 ft. workings, and to swell much-
needed reserves a winze is being sunk in
Taylor’s at 2790 ft. The Moonta is becom-
ing a has-been, the Karkarilla and Taylor’s
shoots yielding ore on a moderate scale. The
refinery has been idle: with a small output
it has paid better to ship the metal as copper-
bottoms to be refined elsewhere. If higher
copper-prices rule the directors will no doubt
set about re-instating cash resources: they are
not the crowd to rush cut divs. until ample
cash is in hand to weather the worst finan-
cial storm.
.* * * *
Alex. Peacock’s crowd are back at allu-
vial : they have taken up what appears to
be one of the Durham lead tributaries
(Vic.). South Durham, the promoting con-
cern, holds about 900 acres covering the
lead. The gamble used to be whether the
Durham gutter was the extension of the rich
Golden Point lead, and claims were pegged
out right to Mt. Mercer of painful memo-
ries. Most of the blocks were given ducal
names, and that was the closest they ever
got to the gold required for their coronets.
Claim-holders squeezed out a fair amount
of funds, and then lost almost every penny.
Whether South Durham is on an east or west
run of gold is unknown to outsiders: all
they are told is that a shaft has bottomed
at 104 ft. on wash that has given 240 z. gold.
llow much dirt was in the sample is not
disclosed. Meanwhile South Durham shares
have soared in anticipation of the floating of
a pup to take 30 acres around the shaft for
£5OO cash and 24 p.c. royalty. Nominal
capital is to be £7500 in 10s. shares, and each
holder in the South Durham has the right
to apply for 200 shares. With the £5OO re-
ceived for this lease, another section of
the gutter is to be tested and other floats
may follow. On this basis South Durham
can beget numerous pup cos. to tackle its
bolding and collect thousands for prospect-
ing. This system of financing dates back to
the old alluvial days, when first-peggers on
gutters stuck out for royalty and free
shares. Times have altered, and it might be
as well for Mines-Minister Barnes to inquire
whether this royalty revival is desirable.
He might also send Stanley Hunter to report
on the field generally.

Carlisle seems likely to be the first of the
Bendigo “pups” to appear on the div. list.
The returns have been showing a steady im-
provement for some time past. For the
week ended the 17th inst. 498 tons yielded
2330 z. (9.3dwt.), and last week 476 tons
returned 3250 z. (13.6dw-t.). The system
of spurs has been worked for a width of more
than 80ft. and over a length of more than
1000 ft. There are occasional enrichments,,
and one of these now appears in the stopes.
some of the small veins being thickly studded
with gold. The satisfactory feature
of operations is that the improvement is
showing in the southern end of the workings,
where the spurry zone has not been explored.
It is many years since the Carlisle had a
bulk crushing averaging over 13dwt. The
present workings are in the once-famous Bell
and Watson ground.
New Blue (Bendigo) last week won 6220 z.
from 600 tons, which was the second best
yield the present co. has had. Since pro-
duction work was started on the run of spurs
now being operated on (about 15 months
ago) the co. has paid 28s. 6d. per share
(£64,125), following on calls of 7s. per share
paid by the syndicate that reonened the mine.
There was a sharp decline in the market-
value of shares last week, consequent on
less favorable prospects in the southern level
at 1600 ft. There was a seeming reversal of
the pitch which gave rise to some uncer-
tainty concerning the continuity of the spurs,
but a later mine-report indicated a probable
restoration to the normal position. There is
only 300 ft. to go to reach the boundary, so
that in reality any continuous deterioration
in bulk and quality of crushing material in
this direction would seriously affect the pros-
pects of South Blue.
* * * *
Very rich stone is reported to have been
struck at the Golden Point mine, Chewton
(Vic.), at a depth of 65ft. There is nothing
in this to warrant the reported local ex-
citement. Castlemaine was noted for rich
surface dabs, but these did not, and cannot,
make a successful reefing field. What is
wanted is some good development in deeper
ground, and experience at the Wattle Gully
mines, the Francis Ormond, the Ajax and
Fryerstown mines is hardly likely to induce
speculators to make any further quests.
Spring Gully mine, at Fryer’s Creek, was
the most successful the district ever had, and
at one stage it held out a big hope of per-
manency; the reef persisted in depth, but
below about 700 ft. there was a total dis-
appearance of gold.
After all, Ajax North, Daylesford (Vic.),
has had a bad half-year. Manager Hansen
has learnt, like others before him, that the
field does not offer much below ,700 ft. or
800 ft. Patches of rich stuff dazzle and mis-
lead. Work has been proceeding north on
the Ajax run of stone at No. 7, but when
sandstone showed up the gold went out.
Rising has not brought in better-grade stuff.
Prospects have been better on McMillan’s
reef, but it is almost impossible to make
sdwt. stone pay these days. Hansen is
now endeavoring to pick up the Ajax runs
of stone at No. 4. Prospecting is also to go
on north at Nos. 5 and 7 levels, where there
is plenty of virgin country to provide a sur-
prise. Most of the knowing crowd, however,
will prefer to watch what happens at. No. 4.
The last workings to the south on the
Garden Gully reef, Bendigo, were in the
Great Southern mine, which, from a succes-
sion of saddle reefs, yielded £145,531 in divs.
on a called-up capital of £34,850. The
which consisted principally of G. Lansell, E.
Mueller and I. Dyason, was very prosperous
in the later ’nineties, the best year being
3898, when £35,437 was distributed. The
mine was equipped with one of the most up-
to-date plants on the field. The last reef
worked was at 1500 ft. The co. did extensive
prospecting work below that level, the bulk of
which, some local authorities assert, was on
wrong lines; anyway, the co. failed to locate
payable ore bodies, and liquidation followed.
The magnificent plant was bought at
scrap price, and it has been idle for many
years. The recent revival of the Ulster, the
next mine to the north, directed attention
to the Southern, and an option over it has
been secured by the Retaliation Reward Co.
It is probable that the levels on the reef at
1500 ft., which is identical with the forma-
tion now being worked by the Ulster, will be
the first objective. No attempt has been
made to trace the reef to the south of this
mine, as the general cemetery is on the
boundary. In the boom days the Garden
Gully Cemetery Co. was formed, but it did
nothing to disturb the peaceful repose of the
graveyard.

The scheme for raising capital to install a
treatment plant at the Costerfield (Vic.)
gold-antimony mines is reported to have been
completed. Hitherto the crude concentrates
have been sent abroad for the separation of
the gold from the antimony, but this is now
to be done on the mine. It is also proposed
to establish works to convert the antimony
into pigment. v

Westralia’s oil boomlet has subsided, and
except for a little activity in Freney’s and
Okes-Durack, the market is lifeless. _ Ex-
emptions are being sought bv lessees in all
parts of the State, and wild-cat promoters
and share-peddlers are bitterly disappointed
at the refusal of the public to become inter-
ested in their floats.
Hancocks (W.A.), where the Empire
Syndicate is getting good to rich values, is
attracting the attention of Adelaide cos.
Mararoa has already acquired an option on
what is described as a “really good thing,”
and Hansel Mundy and about half-a-dozen
others at Mt. Juglah are speking areas at
Hancocks. The Empire’s first crushing of
2000 tons is expected to give a return which
will create a boom in lease-pegging.
Associated (W.A.) is reported to be pre-
paring for the distribution of one share in
the lveeley silver-mine (Canada) for every
one of its own. This distribution will
still leave the Associated with 238,828
Keeley shares. The old Westraiian gold co.
also holds 330,000 paid shares in another
Canadian show, the Vipond gold-mine, at
Porcupine, and has a call on 333,333 more.
This property is reputed to have large pay-
able ore reserves, and adjoins a producer
which last year had a big output. The co.
is still experiencing difficulty in making ends
meet at ivalgoorlie. That show has given
nearly five millions’ worth of the precious
metal.
* * * *
Values are becoming still lower at depth
in most of the Mutooroo’s workings at Mt.
Juglah (W.A.), but as the co. has not pub-
lished unfavorable, as well as good, reports,
the true position has not yet been officially
put before shareholders. Outside the Mutoo-
roo’s pegs operations are almost at a stand-
still, and one by one the cos. which acquired
options on blocks of the surrounding blue
bush are silently stealing away.
Ir « » t
Shutters are up at Youanmi (W.A.), and
the manager has gone to London to confer
with the Board. There is a lot of ore await-
ing development at depth, but shareholders
were disinclined to find further capital, and
an appeal to the State Government for finan-
cial assistance was fruitless.
* * * *
Associated Extended, Emmaville (N.S.W.),
is idle pending financial arrangements being
made to improve the present portable-type
plant and to complete the second plant, which
will be a semi-stationary one, and of much
larger capacity than the other. At a recent
meeting the directors submitted a proposal
for the reorganisation of the co. on the
basis of 52,01)0 shares of ss. each, one-half
of which were to be issued fully paid to
holders in the present co., the remainder to
be available to them, in the first instance, at
Is. (id. per share, the balance in calls as
required. This scheme was rejected, and
it was agreed that 25,982 of the unissued
shares should be issued as 10 p.c. cumula-
tive participating-prefs., preferred both as
to divs. and capital. A special meeting is
to be held next week to confirm or reject
this proposal.
Ponds’ Creek, Emmaville (N.S.W.), is
shifting its plant to the centre of the creek
at the northern end of the Rothschild
property. It is shallow, stony ground, with
a rough bottom, and is said to carry a fair
amount of tin. On reports the co. should
have a short but merry life at this point, but
nothing like that which it had at the fancy
spot near the main-road crossing.
Grampian Hills, Emmaville (N.S.W.),
had the bad luck to run short of water just
as the plant which had been installed on the
Bailey section got fairly moving. The mana-
ger reports that good tin values were met
with in sinking the sump-hole and in open-
ing out the working face, “and a good return
is certain when rain falls.’’
Wellington Vale Sluicing, at Stannum
(the old Nine Mile), near Deepwater
(N.S.W.), possesses probably the largest tin-
bearing area in the State. There is no sug-
gestion that it is very rich, but, considering
the enormous quantity of dirt available, and
its amenableness to ordinary treatment, it
ought to be made a good profit-earning pro-
position with tin at anything like the present
price. The mine has been idle for a long
time for want of water; in fact, beyond
erecting the large stationary plant formerly
owned by Bourke’s Hill, the present co. has
done nothing. Water is now at command,
but apparently sufficient funds are not avail-
able to make a start.
With tin prices better all North Queens-
land centres are getting a move on. The
latest is Ivoorboora, where an early resump-
tion of work at the Two Jacks is promised.
A 15-head stamper-battery is going up, and
the pumping machinery is being overhauled. In
1921 the mine was starting out on a career
which promised payable results on fairly
large-scale operations, but low prices and
strikes resulted in a closure. There was then
a block of 6 p.c. ore in the No. 3 workings
on the 100 ft. level ready for stoping. The
bulk of the ore below, however, is on the low
side, and if it averages 3 p.c. to 4 p.c. all
through it will come up to expectations.
The tin shoot in the Canary, Kangaroo
Hills (N.Q.), continues very persistently to
the north of the main workings, and, although
small, is very rich, the last crushings of 42
tons giving 17 tons 9cwt. concentrates worth
£lBOO. The shoot has now been followed
down to 130 ft., averaging between 12in. and
a couple of feet. Jack Lennox, who owns
a big slice of the Canary, reckons on about
150 tons of concentrates having been proved
by the work so far done. The vein itself,
though on the small side, is proving to be
one of the richest tin veins ever worked in
the State.
Laurence Wilson, on the Golden Horse-
shoe, is proving that old Coolon’s lode is not
the only one on the Mt. Coolon field (Q.).
The 112 ft. south-east level is out 85ft. from
the Golden Bar No. 1 shaft on an average
of 2ft. of payable ore. The crosscut from
this shaft at 50ft. cut 24ft. of lode, and to
the north-west it has made up to 4ft. wide.
Taking into consideration the work done
from the Bar No. 2 shaft, the lode has been
proved to run 140 ft. underground, ranging
from 18in. to 4ft. The values are uncertain:
it is a difficult show to sample owing to the
density of the ore and its patchiness. V alues
may run from ’weights to ounces in a foot
without any apparent change in appearance
of the stone. About 400 tons have been
raised so far, and the average should work
out at between £4 and £5. What looks like
the crop of the lode occurs on the Golden
Sovereign, about 10 chains further north-
west. No work has been, done there: the
lessees seem to be awaiting developments
in the Horseshoe.
Mt. Nolan, at Silver Valley, Ilerberton dis-
trict (N.Q.), is doing well, and prospects of
crushing stuff ahead are so good that Bert
Barratt, the owner, has purchased the Per-
severance battery. Last month a 209-ton
parcel produced 29 tons of concentrates
worth £2350. This came chiefly from the
300 ft. stopes, and the end of the drive on
that level is showing 2ft. of 12 p.c. ore. On
present prospects the show should be the
chief producer on the this year.^
Mt. Clear View, near Cape River (N.Q.),
with Bill Shetland as manager and C. IL
Wray acting for a southern co., is getting
the shake-up of its life. It languished in the
hills as a big, rather barren-looking quartz
crop in a dry spot, and water-supply may yet
be a big handicap to it. Anyhow, Wray is
seeing the sampling through, and on the
whole results have been encouraging. The
crop has been traced 300 ft. by surface
costeens with values up to Isdwt. on a reef
averaging 3ft. thick. The underlie from the
mainshaft is carrying 3ft. 6in. of good
quartz, but there is about 10ft. of formation,
and the hanging wall reef has not been
sighted yet. Another vein passed through in
the adit has been traced 34ft., averaging lft.
wide, and assay values are around £6. The
formation between the reef carries 3dwt. or
4dwt., but this will prove too low to throw
in as battery feed on present appearances.
The show seems to have a fair chance of
making good.

his platitudinous after-dinner speech at an
alleged festive gathering. At last someone
from the end of the table called out “Louder!
Louder!” Then a mild, sad-looking man

“And funnier- Funnier!” The orator sat

mentions the new fashion of painting ladies’
legs with colored designs to be viewed
through transparent stockings. I suggest
tattooing as something far more economical
and enduring. The young ladies of Hanua-
bada and Hula, near Port Moresby, used to
be beautiful examples of neck-to-knee tat-
tooing in a fine blue lacework pattern. And
a little east of Port Moresby are a people
who indicate all sorts of social grades by
appropriate tattoo patterns in prescribed
positions. Anyone who has killed his man
is marked with the D.S.O. of the tribe, and.
no young lady, however attractive, can hope
to be considered as a jazz partner by the
local bucks until she has been invested with
the proper pattern. If something of this
sort were introduced in Sydney, Judges
might not be so often mistaken for waiters
or society pets for ballet-girls. The natives
referred to add fresh tattoo marks as the
individual’s status changes; hence every
person is his, or her, own perambulating
dossier.

“Drayman”: Statistically-minded Austra-
lians are still poring over A.I.F. war-casualty
lists. Thus it is disclosed in the latest-
published battalion history—the Fortieth’s- —
that the 25th Batt. offered the best chance
of a Blighty among Australia’s 00 units of
infantry, for it achieved 8008 killed and
wounded (excluding gassed) ; the 20th came
next with 2892; the 18tli next with 2881;
the 20th fourth, with 2847. Then follow the
28th, 12th, 21st, 3rd. 11th, 19th, 23rd and
17th in that order. Only 18 battalions had
less than 2000 killed and wounded; only
seven less than 1700, and only one (the
43rd) less than 1500. The battalion with
most killed and wounded in the First
Division was the 12th ( 2783) ; in the Second
Division the 25th (3008) ; in the Third, the
40th (2039) ; in the Fourth, the 48th
(2448) ; and in the Fifth, the 59th (2330).

“Lantana”: A “religious atmosphere” is
alleged by some people to be necessary for
the "cures” made by healer Hickson. Well,
there is a N. S. Wales practitioner who
operates in any old place, and certainly
without any “religious” atmosphere at all.
He claims to have effected some wonderful
cures by simple laying on of hands; at
all events he has a stack of testimonials to
that purport. Just at present he is treating
patients in an up-country pub, where it is
hard to credit the “atmosphere” with being
spiritual or even uplifting. And he doesn’t
cure for the honor and glory of God. either,
but does it for a sordid cash consideration.
“P.X.”: N. S. Wales Attorney-General
Bavin says he doesn’t think the framers of
the Federal Constitution intended that the
Federal Arbitration Court should be used
to settle disputes which have been deliber-
ately given an Inter-State character so as
to bring them inside the Court’s jurisdiction.
Mr. Bavin is right. That possibility didn’t
occur to them. It was this way. In the
draft prepared by Barton, O’Connor and
John Downer arbitration wasn’t mentioned
among the “powers.” But it happened that
J. H. Howe, an old S. Australian legislator,
was a director of the Broken Hill Junction
Co. as well as a Convention delegate, and
his political stamping-ground was the dis-
trict around Port Pirie, where the Broken
Hill smelters are. Then, as now, the smelter-
hands didn’t see eye to eye with the more
militant miners, and Port Pirie felt that it
was at the mercy of a crowd over whom its
own Parliament could never have any con-
trol. (It had been like that in the big ’92
strike.) Howe was, of course, interested
two ways, and talked the matter over first
with Charles Kingston and then with
Downer (they had been in a Ministry to-
gether), and so the power to deal with
arbitration was taken —-power to deal with
a dispute which affected more than one State.
The Broken Hill-Port Pirie case was in the
minds of those, at any rate, who were respon-
sible for the insertion of the line; but the
Constitution hadn’t been long in operation
before it was discovered that any old “dis-
pute” could be given an inter-State com-
plexion by bunching, say, the chimney-
sweeps of all the States into one union.
About an unpopular pair:—
The arrival of De Valera's envoys had its divert-
ing side. Immediately they landed protests were
lodged by all those private individuals and public in-
stitutions that habitually rush into print when there
seems any hope of stirring up a row with the R.C.
enemy. Simultaneously a number of R.C.’s rushed
into print with the disconcerting intimation that
this crowd did not want the patriot exiles, and
would be well pleased to see them deported. Accord-
ing to a recent London Chronicle estimate, 40 per
cent, of the Republicans in Ireland are Protestants
of a sort (chiefly English and Yankee desperadoes who
are in the business for what they can get out of it),
and most of the remainder are not “practising Catho-
lics,” and never were. This allegation is the more
credible inasmuch as the R.C. hierarchy in Ireland
is on the side of the Free State. Provided the en-
voys remain long enough, a situation should develop
very similar to that which began by amusing
Canada, but is now perturbing it. When “Instruc-
tion 17” was issued in the Dominion the local anti-
Papists hailed it with joy, as was natural, seeing
they had inspired it. It was aimed at the use of
French in the schools, and infuriated the Catholics cf
Quebec, who are French. Then the L.O.L. found
that the new law delighted the Catholics of Ontario
and Manitoba, who speak English and have little
time for French-Canadians. So the wine of victory
turned to dust and ashes in the mouths of the pro-
fessional anti-Papists, and the nation at large has
been left with an expensive row on its hands. The
people of Quebec are passively resisting- the attempt
to Anglicise them, and their enemies are burning
down Quebec institutions by way of reprisals—the
unfortunate third section paying up for insurance,
extra police, and so on. If our Republican visitors
are deported or otherwise “martyred,” it will please
the R.C. Free Staters here, who probably number
95 per cent, of the K.C. population, and it will please
those Orangemen who don’t know’ that the R.C.’s are
pleased. On the other hand, it will establish" a dan-
gerous precedent and disturb lovers of liberty of the
English pattern (in England Republicanism, Bol-
shevism and any other old “ism” may be preached

till further orders), and it will give the Moscow
brethren of the A.L.P. an excuse for a concerted howl
about the “methods of Czarism.” On the whole, we
will probably do well to remember the old maxim,
and let touring envoys lie.
"Noswad”: It was at Salisbury Plain in
1916. A compulsory church-parade had just
been dismissed, and Capt. Blank asked Pri-
vate Dash what he thought of the sermon.
"I didn't hear much of it, so I wouldn’t like
to offer an opinion,” replied Dash. “Didn’t
hear much! Why, didn’t it interest you?”
“No, not when he started to talk about war-
rant-officers.” “I don’t remember anything
about w.-o's,” protested Blank. “Oh, I
do,” rejoined Dash. "lie started off with

ING OF?
STRANGER: “Excuse me, is this number

YOUNG MOTHER: “Good gracious, no. This
is only my second.”
“Billy Cann”: The mascots presented to
the First Division A.I.F. included dogs of
pedigree and plain dogs, birds, kangaroos, wal
labies and a goat with a Joe Cook beard and
an appetite for anything from Turkish cigar-
ettes to spaghetti. Once, at Mena, while
“Pompey” Elliott was addressing the mob
in his most serious style, Peter, the pet pug
of the Queenslanders, upset our parade by
making violent love to our mong. right under
“Pompey’s” feet. It was too much for the
Old Man, who ordered the Sarn-Major to
place the pair in the guard-tent. He also
addressed a note as follows to the Colonel
of the 9th Batt. : “My compliments to
Colonel . I must request him to keep
his dog Peter in camp. The dog’s amorous
tricks on our parade-ground this morning
caused much confusion in the ranks.” The
Bananalander replied with a request for a
dog-chain. Whereupon there was an explo-
sion : "Does he think this is a crimson cours-
ing match !”

“Herodot” : The oil of the aniseed plant
possesses an extraordinary attraction for dogs
and other animals, which knowledge was re-
cently utilised ,by some University students
to play a hideous practical joke on a well-
known Australian professor. The learned
gent., a martyr to corns, has acquired the
habit of removing his street boots on arriving
at his lecture-room, and encasing his hoofs
in roomy slippers. Watching their oppor-
tunity the jokers smeared the soles and
sides of the resting leather with a liberal
issue of aniseed. It was when the Prof,
started for his tram that things began to
happen. Before he had gone 50 yards a
pack of assorted mongrels was sniffing at his
heels and snapping at one another, while
passers-by stopped to gaze in surprise at the
unusual spectacle of an elderly gentleman in
the midst of a surging wave of wildly-excited
Towsers. At the tram-stop an obliging con-
ductor kicked out the dozen or so canines
that attempted to follow the Professor to his
seat, but he was unable to get rid of the mob
that raced howling and barking alongside the
car till the scent presumably grew fainter.
The Professor is still mystified about the
bond that suddenly developed between him-
self and a section of the brute creation.
“Harold Hardupp” introduces a stickler:
A man with a grievance against N.S.W. Railway
Commissioner Fraser lives near Bondi. The feud was
originally with Tom Johnson, but Fraser acquired
it with the job. It’s all over tuppence. This sum
is the amount the Bondi feudist considers he was
overcharged in 1907 ; and, failing to get satisfaction,
he has refused to ride in a tramcar since that date.
If there are no ’buses he either cabs it or walks
to his daily business in the city. For 15 years he
has been bombarding the Railway Commissioners with
demands for justice and tuppence; and at the
last election he demanded of the various candidates
whether they were prepared to bring his case before
the House. Whatever he has saved in tram-fares can
only be a fraction of what he has spent in pressing
his claim, in cab-hire and in boot-leather, but he
is still determined to fight to the last postage-stamp.
Heaven knows what will happen if he ever hatches
a quarrel with the P.M.G. over a postal overcharge.

“O’Dirf”: Two M.L. scrubcutters have the
latest in cheque swindles to their credit, or
debit. They had finished a £5O job, and their
employer, an old sheepfarmer, made out one
cheque for the whole amount. The pair, pre-
paratory to cashing the cheque, forged
Cocky’s signature on a blank form, and filled
it up for the same amount. The next day
they reappeared at the boss’s residence, and,
handing him the bogus cheque, asked him
whether he would let them have two of £25,
as they intended to go in opposite directions.
The “snoozer” glanced at the cheque without
detecting that it was a forgery, and tore the
“evidence” up before filling in two new ones.
The scrubcutters didn’t wait upon the order
of their going, and the heavy-footed Law is
still limping painfully in the rear of them.

“Caballer”: A wartime rumor in Flanders
credited bombs with making a “slight hiss-
ing noise” before they went off. I never
got any first-hand evidence on this subject,
but there was a Chinaman in a labor-gang
at Achiet-le-Grand who, I am convinced,
settled this question for himself before he
died. Unfortunately his knowledge perished
with him. He salvaged a bomb, pulled out
the pin and seemed to hear something. At
all events his mates, from behind an in-
cinerator, saw him holding the thing to his
ear with a rapt expression on his face. Five
seconds later the top-half of the investigator
went in thin spray past the stars. Perhaps
he told them what he had heard —he left us
much too hurriedly.

“Verde Gris’s” little picture of the black-
est part of Australia :
The almost straight line made by the southern
coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria, if continued in a
north-westerly direction, cuts off from the rest of
the Territory' the coastal country called Arnhem's
Land. Although it is nearly as big as Victoria, it
is inhabited almost exclusively by myall blacks, whose
unpleasant habits include the trailing of spears
through the grass with their toes as they approach
to greet the intruding stranger. Round about the
Alligator River there are several holdings of two
or three hundred square miles apiece, a-s well as
Oenpelli, a Government station and official nigger
resort. East of that little is knowm of the country.
The trepangers and pearlers who sometimes drift

THE ACTOR: "Hone you special terms for

THE LANDLADY: “Yes, I ’are; blit I 'ope I’m

about along the lonely creeks and bays are the suc-
cessors of Malays who, probably for centuries pre-
viously, came down in their proas and left the seeds
of the big tamarind-trees that now shade the relics
of their former camping places. Some of the blacks
along the coast have been found able to speak Macas-
sar as a result of this traffic, which was in full
swing till Customs officers from Darwin began about
40 years ago to make raids for opium and other
smuggled goods. Nowadays this fringe of the Arafura
Sea is merely fished by an odd fleet or two usually
manned by Asiatics. The sudden death-rate among
the adventurers in their intercourse with the blacks
has always been high, possibly as the result of a
frame of mind which the blackfellow acquires in
the course of proceedings for restitution of conjugal
rights. Anyhow, whatever the cause, the Arnhem
Land blacks are bad, and news now comes of an
attack on a fleet of pearlers, in the course of which
the natives about Cape Gray, after waylaying a shore
party, seized the luggers while the crews, mostly
Japanese, were fishing from their dinghies. After
taking all the arms and ammunition they could find,
the blacks wrecked the vessels on the beach. The
crews escaped and rowed upwards of 100 miles to
Elcho Island, where there is a mission station, and
thence news of the affair required nearly a month’s
journey to reach Darwin. An official party' has gone
down, but cannot return inside six or eight weeks —it
may be longer if the natives handle their stolen fire-
arms with the dexterity which a blackfellow soon
acquires.
“Picko”: A well-known colonel of the
A.A.M.C. was the despair of the “lead-
swinger.” A corporal had come in from Tel-
el-Ivebir, listed as having become deaf. In
due course lie was “boarded” before the colonel
and other medicoes. He affected to hear
nothing that wasn’t bellowed. At last the
colonel, making a megaphone of his hands,
shouted : “You look run down, man !” The
corporal nodded and muttered that he felt
a bit that way. The colonel turned and
spoke aside, hardly audibly, to an orderly:
"Put this chap down for two glasses of stout
a day from to-morrow.” He then signalled
OH, THESE MEN!
"Men are always late. I’ve been waiting for
my husband since 6 o’clock, and it’s 7 note.”
"When were you to meet him?”
“I said I’d be here at 5 o’clock.”
to the afflicted one that he might leave, and
the latter passed out, entirely disregarding
a strident qrder to “Shut the door after you.”
Three days passed before the corporal called
the ward orderly. “Hey, Dig.,” he said,
“when do I get my stoutV” The orderly ex-
pressed his ignorance. “Why, damn it all,
the colonel ordered two glasses of stout a day
for me when he boarded me, and I ain’t seen
a smell of it yet.” The orderly said he would
see “Sister.” He saw somebody, for that
night a disgusted corporal boarded the train
for the desert.

“Cartot” on wolf-men :
According- to one of the English medical journals
the first case of “lycanthropia,” or “wolf-madnesß,”
to be reported for over a century has occurred in
south-eastern Europe. It is a well-defined although
extremely rare form of mental aberration; the
“loup-garou,” or human wolf, of mediaeval Europe
was not altogether a superstition. The disease
takes the form of delusions that the sufferer is a
wolf ; thus obsessed the victim will leave his home
and look for the nearest forest. There he will
tear around and howl until he either recovers or
falls in with some real wolves who eliminate him.
Hence the old belief in supernatural beings, possess-
ing the power to turn themselves into wolves and
back again into human shape at will. What with
the gradual disappearance of wolves and changed
social conditions the mania became rarer and rarer.
The last authenticated case, before the present one,
was recorded about 1810 in Roumania.
“Blue Bar” goes dredging:—
A reminder of the old Russian scare was brought
to light the other day in a superannuated gunboat
fished from the waters of Double Bay (Sydney). Two
of them were built at the Atlas Works, in Darling
Harbor, over 40 years ago, designed on the lines of
the Russian torpedo boats of those days. Neither
had any active service and were at last sold to a
contractor, who, finding them useless, sank them in
Double Bay. One of them is still there. The other
was somehow fished up, and placed on slips at the
edge of the water, preparatory to being refitted by
a private owner. The work was never finished —in
fact, it is doubtful if it was ever started —and the
craft, up till a few months ago, rested on the side
of the seawall on the western edge of the bay.
From there she gracefully slid into the water, and
lately was taken up and removed to Darling Harbor,
where she now lies. Her torpedo was a cylinder,
equipped with a detonator, lashed to the end of a
40ft. pole stuck out in front of the vessel. The idea
was to run up under the enemy’s fire, ram him with
the torpedo, and go for your life before the bang.
Early in the recent war-time the gunboat provided
great joy for the schoolboys of the neighborhood,
who were convinced that she was a German sub-
marine. One lad came to school one day with a
Mauser pistol and a saw-edged bayonet which he
swore he got from “the sub.”’ Half of a class
wagged it that afternoon and broke all records head-
ing for the ship. All they found was a decrepit
and rusty old iron hulk with crabs and prawns
swimming round what was once the pride of the
Australian Navy.
“P.P.J.” says barristers have troubles, too:
It is trite knowledge that a barrister cannot sue
for his professional fees, and the ignorant multitude
thinks that it is customary for him to demand
a cheque before going into court. Such used to be
the case. Now, alas, things are different. Excepting
a few old-fashioned firms, solicitors do not send
cheques with their briefs ; many of them wait until
three reminders have been sent to them before making
a belated payment. Indeed, some of them have to
be threatened with exposure to the Law Institute
before coming to heel. And it is not the eminent
K.C. that is the sufferer ; he takes good care to see
that his clerk has collected his big fee before he
dons wig and silk. It is the struggling beginner
who suffers. A while ago the Sydney legal world
was astounded by the crash of one of its most
reputable solicitors, one entrusted with the hand-
ling of thousands of pounds of trust funds. He
owed various counsel sums ranging up to £4OO, a
sightless barrister with a family to support being
a chief sufferer. Of course, not having any remedy
for recovering fees, the advocates were not allowed
to participate in the general division. Again, a
well-known solicitor is accustomed to hand his divorce
briefs to certain young barristers. People remark
on the way young Costs has got on —his name is
continually appearing in the law reports. The
fact is, young Costs gets not a penny for his work —
is perhaps glad to do it for the sake of advertise-
ment —-and has his work cut out to prevent the
bailiff’s men levying on the dusty and musty vol-
umes adorning his shelves.
“Wilfrido”: The mud-slinging type of
counsel is bad enough, but I don’t think
Dante would rank him as low- as the sort
that deliberately prolongs a suit where the
money is good. One of the craft received a
nasty jar the other day in an M.L. case. He
was appearing for a rich man charged with
perjury. In the Lower Court the evidence,
taken before two accommodating J’s.P., had
been allowed to spread over a period of 12
days. In the Supreme Court, Mr. Costs
suggested to the Bench that the jury might
be relieved from duty for the remainder of
the week, seeing that 12 days had been ex-
pended in the lower court and, with his
additional cross-examination, he anticipated
that the case would take even longer here.
“You are mistaken,” said the Judge; “it
will be disposed of in less than 12 hours if
I know anything about it.” After some
wrangling counsel petulantly announced:
“If your Honor will not let me conduct the
defence in my own way, I shall have to re-
tire from the case.” “Ah,” was the ambigu-
ous but caustic reply, “if that should hap-
pen, I should see that the prisoner was in
no way embarrassed.”
“Bolem’s” tale of a colleague’s perfidy:—
Gadby was an inveterate leg-puller. He came to
relieve me on the counter of a South Coast branch,
and having replaced to his satisfaction “holey” and
worn coins in the teller’s cash, I went on

Would be regretted by charming Mabel, daughter of
a wealthy client. When I reported back, having lost
a fortnight of my precious leave through influenza,
Gadby handed over and departed. Within a few days
Mabel came in on business for her father, and when
about to leave graciously inquired how I had enjoyed
my holiday. Scenting a chat, I told her I had
spent most of it in bed; whereupon, instead of the
sympathy I expected, she gave me a look the
memory of which I shudder to recall, and went out.
Much upset and perplexed, I was not sorry when I
was shortly after ordered to a western branch. I
next saw the infamous Gadby as he blew into the
office on his way home front a distant relief job.
After recalling our last meeting, he inquired “How
is Mabel ?” I disclaimed knowledge and remained
taciturn while he retailed the gossip of the service.
Hoping to elucidate my little problem, I finally
relented and told him of my last meeting (and part-
ing) with her. The brute laughed loud and long,
and when he had mastered his hilarity, blandly
informed me that, as a joke, he had told her I had
gone on leave to get married on the quiet.

“Randolph Rentless”: Sydney Chinatown
is on the move again, albeit the city Chow
never moves further than he must. With
the passing of Wexford-street —a squalid
lane devoted to Chinese, white “wives,” half-
caste kiddies, and gambling dens —to make
room for Went worth-avenue, the unassimilable
heathen just moved himself.and his belong-
ings as far as he was pushed. Campbell-
street, already well orientalised, became
completely so ; but it was on the vicinity of
Brisbane, Upton and Bast streets that Asia
converged. Now that municipal resump-
tions have demolished the old rookeries, and
factories are taking their place, the pushed-
out Pagans are changing direction and head-
ing towards Redfern, but this time the exist-
ing denizens —even in Ann-place (or Sand-
bag-alley) are disputing possession, and con-
sequently Chinese outposts are appearing as
far away as Devonshire-street. Actually
there is no Chinatown at present; it is too
scattered to warrant the term. But, by-and-
bye, as white people move out to escape the
incoming yellow tide, it will -concentrate
again—probably in the Campbell, Elizabeth,
Albion, Riley streets block. Of course there are
. Chinese shops all along Campbell-street, in
the city proper, and residences of the shop-
keepers behind them ; but this will only be the
“West End” of the Chinatown of the future.
“G.P.”: Yes, the man who appeals against
a conviction takes a lot of chances. In Q.
the other day a man was sent up for three
years’ hard for entering a house with intent
to commit a crime. The missus heard a
noise, switched on the light, and Mr. Burglar
was captured. After being sentenced to the
aforesaid three years he appealed. Judges
Shand, Lukin and Macnaughton reviewed the
case and socked him for an extra two years
on the evidence.

The cruel blizzards freeze ;

From The Bulletin’s Gallery bird :
Was there ever a milder Minister of Deience than
E. Iv. Bowden ? His Ministerial success has left him
a little excited, but deferential, and he reminds one
of an old-established family butler who has sud-
denly come into money. Probably some of the
boldest brass-hats are already trying to wipe their
boots on him, for his whole attitude is so kindly and
humble that the politest Goth is tempted to take ad-
vantage of it. In the House his fatherly tones, set
off by a bald head that blushes at intervals in a
tonsure of greying hair, is accompanied by a rare
smile that seems an apology for h.s existence. He
never offends a soul, or says aught that can be
regarded as an invitation to violence. One member
took him to task one night, saying: “You know,
Bowden, you are a good sort, but you need more
ginger. We’d love to see you get into a frightful
passion and aim an inkwell at the Speaker.” Bow-
den turned his favorite color. Quite solemnly he
replied: “I wouldn’t dream of such a thing.” And
he wouldn’t.
The £31,000 Van Eyck which has been
bought by the Felton Bequest trustees for
the Melbourne Gal-
lery came from the
collection of C. J.
Weld Blundell, of
1 n c e Blundell,
Lancashire. Aus-
tralia has heard
of that old R.C.
home and family
before. F. A. Weld,
some time Gover-
nor of Westralia,
an d Archbishop
Vaughan were both
closely allied to
the clan; and it
was at Ince Blun-
dell Hall that Arch-
bishop Vaughan
died suddenly dur-
ing a visit to Eng-
land. The then
squire, Thomas
Weld Blundell,
was the Archbis-
hop’s uncle.
CHARLIE
GRAHAM, a new
Labor Senator
from W.A.
J. L. Latham, M.H.R. for Ivooyong (Vic.),
is one of three brothers who found scholar-
ships and exhibitions stepp.ng-stonos to the
University. Brother Leslie is a well-known
medico, and is president of the Vic. branch of
the B.M.A. Another brother, Alan, is secre-
tary of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, and Bert Latham is a
past president of the Actuaries’ Association
of N.S.W. The parent of this flock is a
preacher of the gospel accord ng to John
Wesley. All of his boys have inherited
something of his austerity and independent
character. The politician and K.C. has so
much of the latter that he has long held a
trench for the Rationalist Association.
Bendigo’s new Federal member, Colonel
G. Hurry, D. 5.0., V.D., has been soldier,
solicitor, shire councillor and sportsman. A
native of Ivyneton, he went to Melbourne
Church of England Grammar, then passed
to his father’s law office, and is now senior
partner in the firm. When Armageddon
commenced, Hurry, who had had 15 years
in the Defence Forces, was called to Vic.
Barracks and later left Bendigo with the
38th Battalion. On the death of Major R.
O. Henderson he became second in command
of the battalion, and later was its com-
mander. He gained his D.S.O. at Passchen-
daele, and after the Armistice was signed
he was O.C. one of the depots at Havre. At
Nyah he cultivates grapes and wheat, and
his sporting activities include cricket, foot-
ball, baseball and tennis; he still plays tennis
with the Bendigo Club.
“Outback”: The Bulletin (l/3/’23)
reference to C. B. Fitzgerald recalls that Fiiz.
was the only politician who ever set him-
self on fire in the course of a speech. It
happened in 1902 when he was campaigning
in Barcaldine (Q.). Educated in France
he had acquired the Frenchman’s habit of
talking with his hands. When he had full
steam up his arms went like a windmill and
he violently thumped various parts of his
anatomy. On the night in question he
smote his trousers’ pocket so violently that
he ignited a box of wax matches w T ith spec-
tacular results. Jim Page, who was chair-
man, picked up a jug of water on the table
and extinguished the blazing orator.
“Graeme” : J. Twomey, founder, edi’or and
proprietor of the Farmer and Grazier,
Melbourne, has a rich brogue which in
earlier days be often aired at the Union
Club Hotel. One day, being in the company
of an old pal, he beckoned to another patron
of the house. “Let me introduce you to a
boosum frzend,” he said. "Righto! assented
the newcomer, thinking Twomey had said
“boozin’.” “I’ll make a third.”
“Groper” : I dispute the claim that George
Farrell, Theodores latest recruit, is the
youngest Parliamentarian in Australia, and
enter Edwin Wilkie Corboy for that
competition. Corboy has just turned -6,
and has served 12 months in the L ederal
House and two years in the Westraiian
Assembly. Wisdom doesn’t always go with
youth, but Corboy is developing on right
lines. _ .
Owen Crompton, dead in Adelaide at 47,
was one of the family which built up the
Stonvfell vineyards and olive plantations be-
hind* Magill, and a large olive-oil manufac-
ture. He was a genial citizen, a prominent
rowing man and a bowler.
In his scene-painting days ex-Speaker
ElliOt Johnson had several turns at acting
with companies do ng the N.S. \V. and tj.
smalls. In one role lie had to be the man in
front of the gun. The ancient firelock mis-
behaved itself, and Johnson spent a term in
hospital with bits of rusty metal in his in-
tenor. Those who listened to him when he
was a fighting politician believe that some of
it remained there to lend weight to his long
harangues.
A. J. Hannan, the brilliant young man,
still in the thirties, who takes over the S.
Aus. Crown Solicitor’s job while Dr.
Richards is away, is now wrestling with
his thesis, “Constitutional Law of South
Australia,” for the degree of Doctor of
Laws. He is already, an M.A. and LL.B.
A State-school boy in his home town of
Port Pirie, he worked his way up by means
of scholarships, and then kept the pot boil-
ing as an assistant-teacher at the Unley
1 ligh School.
“Wingella”: Everyone in the N.T. knows
Mrs. Mansfield. The old lady, now' in her
79th year, has spent a third of her long life
in the Territory, and has a fund of reminis-
cences to draw upon. She is one of the very few
who retain memories of the Eureka Stock-
ade fight, having been in Ballarat at the
timei She is still active, even after an acci-
dent that would have killed most of us. Two
or three years ago, while she was alone in
her house, a sharp storm came on, and she,
hastening out to see to some young chicks,
was knocked over by a flying sheet of heavy
iron. The old lady lay under the iron in
the storm for two hours before assistance
came, and then it was some days before she
could be brought in to Darwin Hospital,
where she was found to have a broken hip,
broken knee-cap and several broken ribs.
Yet now, in her own home, though she must
use crutches, she is as active as a cat, and
always ready with a laugh and a joke for
her visitors.
“Lucius”: Alfred Edmund Jaques (B.
l/3,/‘23) may be the oldest solicitor in Aus-
tralia, but he is a mere kid compared with
an English wig, Sir Gardner Englehart, who
was at Rugby in Arnold’s time. Tom
Brown’s old master died in 1N42, 12 months
after Englehart matriculated at Oxford. Lie
was called at Lincoln’s Inn in 1849, almost
three-quarters of a century ago.
Right in the centre of Toorak, one of
Adelaide’s most modern suburbs, there is an
ancient building in which lives Miss E. C.
Prescott. She arrived in S. Aus. 84 years
ago, has lived in her present home for 70
years, and, although enjoying good health,
has hardly ever been outside “Prescott’s
paddock.” She has never ridden in a tram,
and she last saw the city in the early ’fifties.
She sews and still reads hungrily—and
does it without glasses.
The acting-managership of the State Sav-
ings Bank of S.A., with (presumably) the
reversion of Mudie’s billet as manager when
his long leave runs out next January, goes
to C. E. Goldsmith, 57, who entered the bank
os soon as he left Prince Alfred College 41
years ago, and has been there ever since.
Like a myriad other leading S. Austra-
lians, he is son of a parson. Outside the
office he has been prominent in turn at
cricket, tennis and bowls.
The managership of the Colonial Sugar
Refining Co. in Adelaide goes to A. 11. Cham-
pion, who happened to be born in that city
when his father was a master at St. Peter’s
school nearly 40 years ago. But the elder
Champion shortly became headmaster of
King’s School, Sydney, and the younger one
has had all his training there, either at the
refinery at Pyrmont or in the head office.
In the war he acquired two wounds and a
major’s crown ; two of his younger brothers
were killed.
“The Deacon”: Dr. O’Llaran was the
driving force behind Cardinal Moran—in
fact, the Cardinal once referred to O’Haran
as “a unit of myself.” So much so was this
that Dr. Kelly, now Archbishop, one briaht
Monday morning “shot the moon” in pur-
suit of the B shopnc of B'ir>b"v. Miss rv
that episcopal chariot he tripped back ; and
ultimately came into his own. Now he has
an O’Haran of his own—Monsignor Hayden,
President of the Card’rial's College and
1--T" v-MV/w Rich TVni TTovdoTi M Wil-
cannia-Forbes. The new O’Haran, by the
way, has missed the Bishop’s ’bus three
times —Lismore, Christchurch and Bathurst
all put him among the also-rans. A sus-
picion of modernism conveyed in an article
in a mag. published in Rome nearly cost
him his job in Moran’s time.
J. W. Ashmead, who attended the Vic.
Methodist Conference recently—he has been
STEPHEN
BARKER, the
ancient among the
Victorian Senators.
a “local preacher”
for tbe last 47
years - numbered
tbe bushranging
Kellys among his
friends. Dan and
he went on hunt-
ing expeditions to-
gether. Preacher
though he is, he is
still prouder of
them than other-
wise. One of
Kate’s sons was
killed in action in
the war. The old
mother is still
alive, and is now'
in her 94th year.
"Chris”: Mrs. Edward Bull, still living in
Wellington, was one of the first white twins
born in Maoriland. That happened 80 years
ago, and the christening had to be performed
at the Court-house, as the settlement had
no church building. The other sister died
10 years back.
“Jaclcy Boo” (Lond.) : A new edition of
Flinders Petrie’s “History of Egypt” Jins
just been issued by Methuen. William
Matthew Flinders Petrie is the son ox
Matthew Petrie and Anne, daughter of Capt.
Matthew Flinders, the Australian explorer.
He has been the Edwardes P'rofessor of
Egyptology at University College (London)
since 1892, and is probably the greatest
living authority on the subject.
Frank Cooper, M.L.A., is the literary
blunderbuss of Queensland’s Labor party. He
echis an "organ' in Ipswich, his electorate,
and peppers the Liberals in a mostly humor-
ous way. Recently he was told by a politi-
cal opponent that Hell turned out nothing
hotter than his fire. “Not so sure about
that,” Cooper replied. “But I am,” the
assured him. “Of course, of course,”
said Cooper. “I’d forgotten for the moment
that you belong to the National party, and
naturally know what it’s like in Hell.”
Time has dealt lightly with Walter James,
of Westralia, who crossed ov*r to Sydney
and Rotorua (M.L.) for the long vacation.
According to the book he is rising GO, but
he doesn’t look a day more than 35. Yet it
is 26 years since he was a delegate to the
Federal Convention, and just on 10 since he
ceased to be Premier. That was Walter
James’s farewell to politics, although he put
in a term as Agent-General. One of his
sons, a Digger, is by way of becoming a
lawyer, like his dad; another is learning
journalism.
W. Hutchison, of the Sydney A.L.P.
Executioners, was mentioned the other day
as having offered to run for any seat whose
present member might be declared bogus.
That would be like Hutchison, who seems
to have spent all his waking time since he
arrived here a few years ago in trying to
break into the State and Federal Parlia-
ments —and in his sleep has probably been
ridden by the nightmare with a phantasy
that lie had just got in when another general
election was coming on. If they have a
member for Canberra when the capital
arrives some 40 or 50 years hence, the first
billstieker will find Hutchison standing
on a stump in front of Parliament buildings
ready to address the sticker and the jack-
asses.
On a Groom who knows his place
People marvel at the Ministerial record of Little-
ton Groom—he had his first term of office in June,
1905—but considering- the adaptableness that enabled
him to associate with the Freetrader Cook and the
Socialist Hughes without a blush, the feat isn’t so
remarkable. Of course, Groom has had the luck to
be the foremost Liberal in Queensland for many year?,
and the debased principle of State representation in
the Cabinet has, on that account, brought him several
good jobs. But, apart from that, Littleton had the
further good fortune to be the son of a. popular
father, and his own amiable personality, coupled with
his severe respectability and his breathless industry
as a party /hack, got him recognition when those
qualities counted for something in a very young
House. Groom has run almost the whole gamut of
office under various Prime Ministers. He has been an
Honorary, Vice-President of the Executive Council,
Attorney-General, Home and External Affair*,
Customs, and Works and Railways. But the principal
billet will never be his. He is not a leader of men,
and he hasn’t the courage for independent action.
In the one notorious instance in which he was tested
—to wit, the gallop back to office after the bogus
resignation at the end of the second Conscription
defeat—he was lost.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
"How’s That”: A fish six feet long was
recently caught off Freshwater (N.S.W.), near Manly.
It was said to be a tiger-shark, but certain features
about him cause me to think differently. For one
thing, the body was covered with black spots about
half-an-inch in diameter, and, for another, the
mouth had not the usual peculiarities of a shark’s,
neither was it in the right position. The brute made
only a 15-minutes’ fight before taking the count, a
poorer performance than I’ve ever known a real
shark to put up when well and truly hooked. Any
Abo. recognise the description?
A HEAT WAVE.
“Did you ring for anything , sir?"
"Yes, for Heaven's sake bring me a cool pen!”
"Outback”: Jimmy All Foo, of Long-
reach (B. l/3/’23), had seven daughters and five
sons, all accomplished musicians. One son, Fred,
was for years bandmaster of the Kennedy Regi-
mental band in the Towers. It was “Malee” (Mary)
who was asked to oblige with “The De’ Littee
Shamlock,” “because the wild Ilishmen are coming,”
referring to the navvies working on the Central
line, then nearing completion. Jimmy, by the
way, helped to give the brilliant but erratic Charles
Borromeo Fitzgerald, the first Labor Attorney-Gen-
eral in Australia, a lift up the ladder. Jimmy ran
a dance-hall next to the pub; you just stepped
out of the bar into the hall. A sergeant of police
prosecuted him for allowing dancing and singing on
licensed premises, but Fitz blew the sergeant to
ribbons by demonstrating that the hall and the pub
were separate buildings.
“Min Yip”: “Tough Mike” is mostly right
in his reply to “Yarrum’’ re shooting hoists (D.
S/3/’23), but he might have mentioned that an
ordinary 12-bore shotgun is the weapon to use.
Load in the Usual way, and when taking aim stand
back about six feet, and strike home at a point
just below and behind the ear. This will miss the
jawbone, and the result will be as “Yarrum” pre-
dicts. It is cruel to shoot a horse with a rifle,
unless you are an expert marksman and know
exactly how to locate the brain. With the shotgun
the foregoing method means instantaneous death if
the aim is at all accurate.
.( * *
“Ragar”: “Bill R.’s” magpie that used to
whistle, and so cause the hands at the freezing-
works to knock off before shift-time (B. 8/3/’23),
reminds me of one that belonged to a sawmill em-
ployee in Queensland. This bird gave a perfect
imitation of both the hand and buzz saws, the
rattle of the cow-bell with which cookie used to
announce the meals, the clatter of knives and forks
against the metal plates, the yelp of cookie’s dog
(fetching the owner out to see who was doing the
kicking), the scream of the white cockatoo and
the ringing of the alarm clock. It was this last
accomplishment which eventually caused hhr down-
fall, a new chum getting her with his No. 10
after having been awakened and fooled half-a-dozen
times. The fight between Maggie’s owner and her
murderer is still talked of in those parts.
* » * *
“Jim Carew”: “Caesar’s” par.(B. l/3/’23)
about an attempt at drought-breaking reminds me
of a pathetic incident in my own career. I was
working on a drought-stricken station in Northern
Westralia, and things were looking serious. To
make matters worse, a very old black gin persisted
in boring us with shrill stories about her wonderful
rain-making powers. She became such a nuisance
that at last, to get rid of her, I gave her a
week’s rations, and told her to do her darnedest.
She went into the bush promising us “plenty rain,”
and three days later it was pouring. We had
three solid weeks of it, but it cost the old girl
her life. When she returned to camp the tribe
had got tired of the incessant moisture. They
stood it for 10 days and then, being properly
scared, they demanded that she should apply the
closure. This the lady protested that she was
unable to do. So they destroyed her with a nulla-
nulla.
• * « *
“Basalt Boulder”: Queer accidents, is it?
Years ago on the Dawson River (Q.) I was helping
Jim Thompson, one of Australia’s crack scrub
dashers, to put a poly bullock into a small pen. Jim
had a wooden peg in his hand to block the gate
with, and Poly charged.' James threw the peg at
the bullock’s nose; it cannoned back—and Jim was
known as the “one-eyed
stockman” on the Dawson
afterwards. Fred Collins,
not long deceased, of
Spring Creek and Brook-
lands (N.Q.), lost an optic
through the knot on a
greenhide rope attached to
a young horse slapping him
in the lamp as the young
’un pulled back. Billy
Low, one of the pioneers
of the Armidale (N.S.W.)
district, lost an eye through
the bearded stubble pierc-
ing the ball when he was
reaping a headland of
wheat. Jim Low, a brother,
lost his through a chip
from an axe while cutting
wood. Young Jim, his
son, was striking in the
blacksmith’s shop at the
old Highland Mary mine,
near Swamp Oak, Walcha,
(N.S.W.), when a piece of
steel, red hot, chopped an
eye out as clean as a
whistle. A couple of years
later a bit of timber fell
300 ft. down a shaft at
Cobar (N.S.W.) and skew-
ered him through the
shoulder. Twelve months
after that a steel drill ran
amok for 400 ft. and went
through his instep. So he
got his cut in the Accident
Stake?. A few days ago
on Chudleigh Parle station
(N.Q.) Old Bill, the saddler,
when assisting the butcher
to yard a killer, threw a
nigger’s nulla-nulla at the
“fat.” It went round
the horn and looped-the-
loop on to W’illiam’s nut.
Old Bill said, “Dam’ that Abo. column. I suppose
these things happen just to make somethin’ for
you blankers to write about.”
* ♦ * •
“Clutter”: “E.K.” (B. 22/2/’23) jogs my
memory. At Port Hedland the race club was
arranging a stunt in aid of one of the war funds,
and the mail-driver weighed in with a pair of
emu eggs—he had picked them up on his last cross-
country drive. A rouseabout volunteered to carve
them. While he was operating on the first
egg the second, which had been wrapped in blankets
at the foot of his bunk, hatched out. Mick Mannion,
the publican, kept the youngster in the yard with
his fowls until it became too dignified to con-
sort with common ehooks. Then it was sent to the
Perth Zoo.
“Bill R.”: Some time ago an Abo. told of
a Narrominc (N.S.W.) butcher who put in a spell
at hospital through getting the lash of his stock-
whip hitched over his shoulder and the handle
through the cart-wheel spokes simultaneously. At
Burgendore (N.S.W.) the other day a young-lady
had an exactly similar accident, only in her case
the lash half-hitched around her throat. She was
rescued, but not before she was closer to strangu-
lation than she will ever be and live.
“Yarrum”: I bad a magpie’s nest in the
Merrivva (N.S.W.) district under close observation
for days, and saw the old birds take turn about
at sitting. Sometimes the old man was dilatory in
turning up for his shift, and the missus had to call
YASS.
FIRST TRAVELLER ( not sure about the road) : “ Yass?”
SECOND DITTO: “Yass?”
FIRST DITTO: “Yass.”
SECOND DITTO: “ Yass .”
loudly and often before be materialised. Once be
sat with a strange lady on a limb, 100 yards
away, and his old dutch, with all her calling and
cajoling, couldn’t get him to come to her. He
had evidently laid aside his vows for a while.
Eventually, when she had done nearly two hours
overtime, the indignant matron flew' from the
nest, chased away the bold, bad flapper, gave hubby
a good scolding, then flew with him back to the
eggs. Notwithstanding the little domestic rumpus
Mrs. Mag. wasn’t at all revengeful, as I noticed
tn,.t w'hen his shift was up the old boy was
rt lieved on the tick.
“Pat Bushie”: As we sat round the camp-
Tre the other night, smoking, Bill, a non-smoker,
volt.steered a song, and forthwith started. After
a few bars had been murdered one of the party
asked, “Do you know all that song, Bill ?” “Too
right, I do I” he answered. “Well, write it out for
me,” was the reply, as pencil and paper were
handed to Bill. “What do you want it for?” asked
William. “To burn the blanky thing!” was the
solemn reply.
•***•#
“Dr. Nil”: Has any Abo.-liar noticed that
ants travelling on a well-worn ant-track keep to the
right ? i am not prepared to assert that this is
always the case, bat upon such a track, running
parallel with my front verandah, the ants do as I
say. Not without variation, though. When the
two opposing streams meet upon an extra-rough
patch they split up and pass Sydney-wise, i.e., half
right and half left; but taking them by and large,
the main columns pass each other by the right.
This holds good for at least four yards of track
which has been worn into a quite noticeable hollow.
Day after day I have watched them, and I think
nearly 90 per cent, observe this rule of the road.
They are not the purple ants that live in large
flat nests, but dark-blue ones of about the same size,
with green square heads, like those of the well-
known but much smaller and slower green-heads.
* * * *
“Buzz”: The prad that jumped the rail-
way gates with the baker’s cart (B. 15/2/’23) had
a relative at Kyneton (Vic.) about 1905. A horse
with a heavy jinker and a 70-year-old driver did
the trick uphill over the high station gates. The
steed was running in the grocer’s cart next day, the
man was back at his business, and the jinker had
one step slightly bent. But the Railway Depart-

“The Rumpus” : I have always known that
a blaekfellow’s dog is half his blanket and food-
provider, but now I have learned of a new quality.
Outside a mia-mia I saw two piccaninnies, the
elder with a mangled big toe, and the younger
with the tips off his fingers and thumbs, and the
ends unhealed. Dad Binghi told me a stone had
dropped on one boy’s foot, while the other had
crawled into a heap of red coals and ashes. “Have
you cleaned and washed the wounds?” I asked.
“Him do that feller work,” said the old chap,
nodding at his mangy hound. Yes, the abo.’s dog is
half his doctor, too.
“ J.T.C.” : I am disappointed that someone
did not account more adequately for the ’roo’s habit
of thumping the ground. The thumping is done
with the feet, never with the tail. It has been
palled a danger-signal to all animals, and birds also,
but this is correct only because other animals and
the birds have learned to interpret the ’roo’s foot-
warnings meant for other ’roos. Three things I
have learned as a result of patient study are that
light irregular thumping means “I suspect trouble
—be careful” ; vigorous thumps, one-two, signify
“Danger ahead or near, for certain” ; and thumps
increasing in vigor, one-two-three, with the feet
describing a circling movement, are a definite warr-
ing to retreat. There is no doubt in my mind that
kangaroos “talk” to each other with their feet.
And this queer ’roo language should be understood
by every wideawake hunter, particularly when in
ambush near water.
“Murrawee”: Will tlie grey and red kan-
garoos cross? One of the zoological Le Souefs tells
me that he has never known it to happen, but that
he had his suspicions in the case of a red kanga.
and a wallaroo. However, the matter could not be
determined, as the suspect never reached maturity.
Being a kangaroo-keeper, and curious, I shifted an
auburn lady’s husband and put a greyback in his
place. That was three months ago, and so far this
chaperon hasn’t noticed any love-making. The
matron is carrying a three-months’ baby in hev
pouch, but her first (red) lord was responsible.
“Herodot”: A trick fairly common
amongst foxes in the Northern ranges of N.S.W. ; s
to free themselves from fleas by threatening the insects
with drowning. Reynard’s scheme is to take a
stick, about six inches long, in his mouth and then,
by hanging backwards over a creek or waterhole,
submerge his hindquarters until the parasites have
NOTHING WRONG ABORT THAT ,
SURELY!
“’Sense me, Mister, but would you mind me
takin’ a couple of these feathers to clean
me pipe with?”
been forced to seek safety on the upper portions
of his body. Then, little by little, he lets himself
into the water so that the fleas crowd on his head
and his muzzle and from there to the stick. This
he releases, and they have to swim for it.

NESTING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The jackass builds in the ti-tree,
The magpie builds in the gum,
The robin will hide in a hollow stump
Where wild bees hive and hum ;
And a boy goes forth for treasure
By the lust of plunder pressed,
For there’s never a joy in all the world
Like the joy of robbing a nest.
A man’s strength goes in striving
A hundred prizes to win,
And some are the prizes of honor,
But most are the wages of sin ;
Yet though he may win them and hold them
And rise to his fortune’s crest,
He will know no thrill like the thrill of a boy
Who takes the eggs from a nest.
The sparrow builds up in the spouting,
The yellow-tail builds in the scrub,
The mudlark looks for a quiet swamp
And the finch for a garden shrub.
But the boy is always a robber
Who stalks on a ruthless quest,
And there’s never a heart that leaps like his
When he lifts the eggs from a nest.

HUDSON—the most respected car
No statement could more completely
describe the position held in Australia
to-day by the Hudson than does the
above.
It is curious, but nevertheless true,
that while controversy has and will
rage round the merits and demerits
of various makes of cars in all com-
munities, concerning the Hudson
there is a unanimous opinion, even
amongst its competitors, that it is a
car of the finest quality and perform-
ance and represents undoubtedly the
best money-value obtainable to-day.
In short, the Hudson is a “venerable” car, that,
having by honest service reached the highest rung
in the ladder of fame, carefully retains its position
by constant modernising and improvement after
thoroughly testing each innovation to make sure of
its actually being a permanent improvement.
Buy a HUDSON and possess a car that is respected by
everyone. There is considerable pleasure to be derived
from this friendly atmosphere, added to the general
satisfaction that is invariably obtained from the car itself.

“Huffin-Guffin”: Are Australian-bred
sheep changing their camping habits ? Forty or
fifty years ago a big leafy tree was selected for a
camp and used year after year. The “camping-tree”
was a landmark in each station paddock. Now the
one-big-camp idea is all changed. Mary’s grown-up
lambs seem to drop under any old shady place
handy to where they may be feeding when the sun
gets too warm. (Some have no shade trees to go to.
The man who keeps his sheep in treeless paddocks
all through the summer, as some do, ought to
have a specially reserved seat in the boiler-room of
Tophet.) Also, sheep are not so easily kept within
fences as they were when fences were new-fashioned.
A gum-bough hung over a gap would then suffice
to get jumbuek thinking. Now, if startled, he will
dive through wires only six inches apart. A loose
w’ire is all he wants to get next door, anyhow.
“FY7”: Tell “Bullswool” (B. l/3/’23)
that his friend who made wooden bowls from the
swellings on gum trees was not the original patentee.
Many of the Western Queensland aborigines used to
make bowls in this fashion. Some tribes* are said
to have been in the habit of boiling water in
them, by dropping red hot stones into the basin—
knowrn in S.-W. Queensland as “coolanion.”
“H.L.N.”: Peter Mulheron in a remote
age kept a hotel at Wentworth Falls, on the Blue
Mountains, and took a hand in the construction of the
tourist tracks. One frosty night Peter undertook ro
drive Rev. Father from the Falls to Lawson. The
load was slippery, and Peter had taken just a drop
of warm stuff to keep out the cold. (I am silent
as to his Reverence.) Somehow the whole outfit
crashed down a steep bank by the roadside. Peter
and the padre lay where they fell—and so did the
PEAINLY PROMINENT.
“Who's the old pot?”
“ He’s one of our most prominent men.”
“Yes, man , I can see that; hut what’s his name?”
horse, being well .jambed under the shafts. About
two hours later Peter sprang abruptly into con-
sciousness, and, having no recollection of the lapse
of time, fell suddenly on the astonished horse’s
head, yelling “Lay still, ye baste, lay still!”
“Pat Bushie”: Here’s for another stakes
—The Plum Pudding Shield. It was made last
Christmas for a road-gang on an out-back Queens-
land road. I forget the exact quantities of the
ingredients,- but after boiling for 18 hours in a
400-gallon tank it still wasn't cooked, so the navvies
cut slices off and fried them. They lived on puddin’
for close on a month.
“Know Nothing”: There has been a bad
drought in my N.S;W. cow-district, and no grass.
But, talking about cows, I’ve just been on my knees
to one, seven months old, at which no bovine Mrs.
Grundy can sniff, although she gives 241 b. of milk
and a 3.8 test. The cocky charged nothing for a look,
but was as close as an oyster when I asked how
you bred ’em.
♦ * * *
“Flashpoint”: “Betterave” (B 8/3/’23)
clouds the issue raised by the first “snake-and-little-
children” correspondent by bringing in carpet-snakes.
It is ridiculous to suppose that any snake capable
of getting outside a baby is going to forego a meal
because the infant meant it no harm. The question
is whether a venomous reptile is capable of appre-
ciating the innocuous intent of a small child, and, on
that account, of abstaining from biting, although
annoyed and possibly hurt. I await further Council
opinion on ,the point.
“Betterave”: “Archbill’s” advice (B.
8/3/’23) for re-queening a colony of bees is right
enough, but she will not be laying in 14 days, as
he states. After hatching, a three-days’ affair, the
larva is provided with tucker (royal jelly for the
queens, plain chyle for the others), is sealed down
and emerges in 12 days. From 5 to 10 days later
she is fertilised, and laying commences soon after
the wedding—which is, by the way, the husband’s
funeral. A good queen will lay 200,000 eggs per
annum for several years.
“Spenner”: I was getting round a few
traps I had set when old Joe joined me. Joe occu-
pied a small humpy Mown by the creek, and w'as
as much a part of the landscape as the gums.
Arriving at a burrow down which the trap had been
drawn I dropped to my knees, intending to thrust
my arm in and grab the bunny by the leg. “I
wouldn’t do that,” said Joe. “Better pull the trap
out by the chain.” “But if I pull the trap I’ll pro-
babiv lose the bunny,” I retorted. “There ain’t no
bunny in that trap,” replied Joe, and he broke a
stick from a neighboring sapling. Unconvinced,
but deferring to the elder man’s bushcraft, I pulled
the trap by the chain. Out shot an infuriated black
snake, about loin, of the tail caught in the
jaws of the trap. Had I been alone I should have
been bitten. Old Joe’s senses, keenly alert, hadn’t
failed to read the signs correctly—the chief difference
between the home-made bushman and the imported
article.
“Iford”: Twenty or thirty years ago, and
probably long years before that, a favorite bush
pastime was to try to
fit the two halves of
wax-match boxes so
that one plaid pattern
would dovetail, as it
were, into the other.
There was seldom any
lack of material for
the diversion, and
experimenters seemed
to be buoyed up by
the hope that luck
would send them the
longed-for combination
some day. Is this
quaint game of “pati-
ence” still played, or
has it become obsolete'?
Personally I never saw
the perfect fit achieved,
but there was a tradi-
tion on the Murchison
(W.A.) that an old
prospector in the Mag-
net district had found
the two matchbox affi-
nities after long years
of effort. The ancient’s
camp was littered up
with disused boxes ; he
bought all he could and
cadged all the empties
he could, and the end-
less quest had whiled
away long nights innu-
merable. He never
read; all his leisure
was devoted to the
matchbox puzzle. One
day they found him
dead. The smile on
his face was so beatific
that it occurred to
someone to force the
clenched hands apart
on the chance that
there might be a
nugget there. There
wasn’t —but there were
two halves of a match-
box that fitted to the
most minute detail.
The aged fossicker had found at last what
he had been seeking half a lifetime, and the pure
joy of it had killed him.
* * * *
“Key-string”: “Ack F. C.” (B. 8/2/’23) is
sceptical regarding my absolutely truthful state-
ment that I slew 5000 ’roos in four years. Let me
tell him I didn’t take one day off for Sabbath observ-
ance, nor yet 65 days for etceteras. I kept a man,
whom I can produce, to do all the work except shoot
and skin. Although I operated in two States my
best results were obtained on the N.S.W. North Coast.
Yes, if a man can’t get six shots a day with
75 per cent, of kills he had better give the game up.
* * * *
“D.F.”: What “N. or M.’s” ancient friend
told him (B. 8/3/’23) about the disappearance of
half-caste children amongst the abo. tribes in Vic.
in the old days is quite right, but it is unlikely
that cannibalism had anything to do with it. The
SEEKING A NEW SENSATION.
“So this is the first time you've ever left Port
Darwin! You must have important
business to fetch you so far?”
“Well, I heard 'em, talkin' about this 'ere jazz
tea you kin git down South, an’ I’m
wantin’ to try it — ain't no bite in any
you kin git up our way.”
same thing happened amongst the Tasmanian abos.,
and there is not a scrap of evidence that they
were ever cannibals. The public opinion of the tribe
insisted on the killing of half-castes. Practically
all the people who have a dash of Tasmanian abo.
blood are descended from the half-caste offspring of
women who had been removed from the reach cf
the tribe, mainly those stolen or bought by the
sealers of the Bass Straits islands.
THE BALLAD OF A PHANTOM TRAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They say the train went off the lines
One evening fifty years ago;
It left the track just where it twines
Towards old deserted Indigo.
Then Indigo had twenty pubs
And roared with trade by night and day,
Where now the wandering bullock rubs
The rotted weatherboards away.
The train rushed down a tree-clad hill,
But where it went to none can guess.
The best black-trackers tried their skill
To find its ultimate address,
But never wheel or carriage door
Or splintered buffer met the eye,
Though people hurried to explore
The valleys low and ranges high.
The bush for fifty miles around
Was searched in every turn and crook
Until men’s feet had worn the ground
In holes by coming there to look.
The seasons came and went again.
Up-trains went dowrn, down-trair.s went up;
But all the hunting was as vain
As nailing bubbles to a cup.
Then Indigo lay down to die.
Five thousand miners left the place;
The stores were closed, the pubs went dry,
The houses wore a battered face.
And trains went by without a pause,
While gum-trees sprouted in the street;
There was no need to stop because
The ruin had been made complete.
At Greentown settlement arose.
They built a brand-new station there;
And Soapstone on the mountain’s toes
Had one small pub still in repair.
So up the hill the engines went
To other places people know,
But there was neither house nor tent
Within three miles of Indigo.
But in the night and in the day
Strange haunted puffs of sound were known,
The roar of wheels upon the way,
The sudden scream of whistles blown.
Men eager for a morning train
Would hear it come like rushing fate
And almost burst their lungs with strain,
Then have a full half-hour to wait.
NONE O’ THOSE TRICKS FOR DAD.
DAD: “G imme a ticket to Tumbarumba.”
CLERK : “Change at Wagga Wagga.”
DAD: "No fear! You gire to me now,
son.”
Yes, just beyond the Greentown ridge
They heard the whistle loud and shrill ;
But when they reached the station bridge
The line was absolutely still.
And in the night, through frosty air,
The same sounds thrilled the Soapstone ears
Till people sat with shuddering hair <
And only whisky eased their fears.
The phantom train Was heard by all,
But none had ever seen it go
Until a wanderer chanced to call
One eventide at Indigo.
Riding to seek a cow that strayed,
He heard the ghostly whistle call,
He heard the wheels upon the grade,
He heard a sudden signal fall.
And all at once a great grey train
Drawm by a rusty engine clanged
And stopped as if in heavy pain.
A dozen open doors were banged.
He heard swift steps and voices spoke,
The empty platform filled with sound :
It seemed as if the dead awoke
And ghosts in bluchers blundered round.
Thereafter, when their toil was done,
From Greentown ridge and Soapstone hill
The curious came at set of sun
And, watching, as the dusk grew still
Observed the phantom train arrive.
Heard the doors bang, the porters shout;
Hut, though the voices seemed alive,
None saw the passengers get out.
Each time the train went loudly on;
But elsewhere on the curving line
None marked the way that it had gone
Nor saw its yellow headlight shine.
Only its ghostly sounds were heard —-
The children knew its puffs and tones....
But this has really not a word
To do with Merlin Griffith Jones.
For Jones in youth was crossed in love
And learned to drown his sorrows deep,
He lived in the third house above
Tile Soapstone church and murdered sheep.
A butcher gory in his trade,
His face was red, his hair was grey ;
If in his youth he loved a maid
He dearly loved his rum to-day.
And Jones was missing. He had been
Upon a wild, devouring spree;
And Soapstone never yet had seen
A man who drank as much as he.
The sheep unmurdered slept in wool,
Regardless of what mutton cost;
Tlie midnight airs were sharp and cool,
And Jones had been a fortnight lost.
Then someone raised a hue and cry;
The gullies round were hard with stones—
Most dreadful spots in which to die —
And so they went to look for Jones.
Their coo-ees echoed on the hill,
Their lanterns glimmered in the night •
Tlie man they sought was missing still
When the moon rose on Friday night.
At last hope yielded to despair;
Things boded very little good;
Three weeks of dieting on air
Without a single bite of food
A man like Jones might well survive,
But none among them dared to think
That he could ever keep alive
So very long without a drink.
Perished of thirst! Oh, bleak and sad
Those streams that from the mountains come !
With sparkling water to be had,
No gully held a drop of rum.
So wandering mournfully and slow
From ridge to ridge and vale to vale,
The searchers came to Indigo
Just as the light began to fail.
Then suddenly the signal fell,
And far away were snorts and squeals ;
The phantom train, as all could tell,
Was drawing near on rumbling wheels.
The rumble droned into a roar,
The headlight gleamed around the turn ;
They heard the hissing piston snore,
The}' saw the glowing fire-box burn.
Ghost porters shouted “Indigo!”
A second smoker door flew wide.
The watchers held their breath to know
That only dead men sat inside.
Only the dead in formless guise
That old grey train stood round about....
And then they nearly broke their eyes
With sheer amazement — Jones (jot. out!
Yes, there was Merlin Griffith Jones,
His cheek unblanched, his form unshrunk ;
And by his loud and dulcet tones
He seemed ecstatically drunk.
They questioned him with lips of fear —-
Their knees were trembling with the shock —
He only shed a gentle tear
And murmured “ ’Shatter six o’clock.”
And so they softly led him back
To where the lights of Soapstone lay ;
Their lanterns glimmered down the track
And no man had a word to say.
But when the morning from its tent
• Walked on the mountains’ topmost stones,
The township rose with one consent
And all got drunker far than Jones.

Dame Margaret Davidson opened the
Country Women’s talk, but didn’t stay for
much of the serious deliberation prepared
by the live-wire president! Grace Munro, and
her bustling organising-secretary, Marie
Irvine. Dame Margaret had to rush back
to the, Macquarie-strcet castle to welcome
visitors for the Easter carnival. The women
who have journeyed from all over the State
and from other States to put their heads to-
gether to better the conditions of the women
and children out back are not giving all
their attention to serious subjects. There
was the big reception at the Conservatorium,
where the lady from Bourke had a chance
to discuss the possibilities of getting tired
mothers and pale babies to the sea w hen
the thermometer threatens to burst out West.
Miss Currie, who started the Seaside Homes
movement in Victoria, was the big autho-
rity on summer-camp ideals.
Dame Margaret was a very business-like
chairman of the annual meeting of the Bush
Nursing Association at the B.M.A. rooms.
The humane organisation has been a godsend
to many a sick sister out-back, and one does
not know what a heroine is until one hears of
the hardships and the medical as well as
nursing exploits of the bush Nightingales—
for nurse is often doctor too. And often
the domestic drudge for her patient and a
family. A hard life, with little pay and
less recognition; yet there is always a
big-hearted woman ready to take on even
the worst of the jobs.
Beatrice Osmond (introduced in this page
a few months ago when she passed through
to visit her sister in Tasmania) was invited
to meet the Feminists on Saturday after-
noon. A member of the Advisory Board of
the House of Commons sounds rather a for-
midable person to meet; but she is merely
delightful. She will not talk about herself;
even when she was brought to her feet to
reply to president I'reston Stanley’s con-
tralto tribute, she made it appear that every
woman in England did a bigger job. She
talked about Sydney, though, and what she
had seen of Australia. She glows with
enthusiasm in private conversation—adores
the peeps of sea that gladden the eye at
so many unexpected twists of the city ; loves
our beaches, adding pathetically, “You know
we have to go at least 60 miles from London
to enjoy a bit of sea, and then we don’t really
find a beach.’’ The blue-eyed Englishwoman
also loves the sunny spirit-—she might have
gone on saying pretty things, but the tea-
b'dl rang. Mrs. Wakeham, J.P., of South
Aus., reinforcing the Feminists, proceeded
to “deal with” the men for having kept
women in subjugation for so many centuries
—kind of hitting below the belt, since there
were only three males in the company, one
a small boy of 10, musician Archie lian-
claud and David Inglis. The trio had gal-
lantly employed the afternoon serving tea to
tne clown-trodden feminists, and hadn’t even
a chair to sit on. They simply put their
backs to the wall and made a picture of
penitence. Ruby Rich relieved the atmo-
sphere by telling the story of Beatrice Os-
mond’s work that could not be dragged from
herself; and Beatrice hid her blushes beneath
the brim of her convolvulus-laden black hat.
Chief Justice Cullen’s lady, with a black
velvet hat wreathed with a white plume top-
ping her silver-grey costume, opened the
rede in the grounds of the Royal Hospital for
Women on Friday, and spoke like a book on
the great work done by an institution which
is usually too busy to even mention its labors.
The Police Band occupied the ■ highest ter-
race and discoursed classical airs to ■ a jazz
band on the broad lawn ; and a company of
brown-limbed lasses from Paddington Public
School trod a measure of old folk dances,
and gave a few graceful eurhythmic exhibi-
tions. On tw r o evenings the youth of Pad-
dington jazzed on the green lawns, and vowed
it was much better than dancing indoors.
.Tosie Melville and Gracie Lavers, looking
like a pair of pink roses, sold sweets; Dame
Alice Chisholm had a cake canteen that was
not nearly so strenuous as El Kantara;
Mrs. J. C. Williamson handed Mrs. W. P.
McElhone £5 to set her stall going, and then
went around and made a few purchases at
every other one. Matron Clark and off-
duty nurses lent a hand wuth refreshments.
As for the other nurses —well, Young Aus-
tralia wouldn’t delay his entry into this
wide world for the most important fSte in
the universe.
The Union Club, which has been in a state
of-chaos for-months past, is to be re-opened
in April. Some of the members have taken
advantage of the hospitality offered by the
Australian and Warrigal clubs, but a faith-
ful few have refused consistently to do so. Day
after day they have crouched near an impro-
vised bar in a humpy in the garden, and with
the crash of falling building materials and
the shouts of the workers in their ears, have
tried to pretend that nothing unusual was
toward. The most prominent figure in this
little band is “Mickey” Grant, who looks
about 50, yet is old enough to remember the
very early days of the club.
The youngsters put a grand finish on “Be
Kind to Animals Week” at the Conserva-
torium, listening with great respect to pre-
sident Acoeks before going through their
eurhythmic displays, their glad choruses and
their bird-mimicry. The Conservatorium
has never been a more joyous, melodious
aviary.
Monty Somer is the big man of this season,
or lie will be until Saturday, when he will
have to share the honors with the A.J.C.
The Show is bigger than ever, and so is
Monty’s smile. The mammoth work of
organisation sits so lightly, apparently, on
this bluff countryman that he spends his
leisure jazzing.. llis cheery grin was a joy-
ous'sight when he stepped to the strains of
the band that opened the biggest attraction
of the newest thing at the Agricultural
Ground—The Capitol, in the Great White
Way.
Alfred Wunderl'ch, the first performing
president the Philharmonic Society ever had,
waited long enough to welcome the disbanded
Choral Society into the fold and to take
part in the Phil.’s rendering of Bach’s “Pas-
sion” on Thursday night; then he set out
on the Narkunda for nine months’ wander-
ing among the crotchets and quavers of
Europe. Four days earlier his doctor-brother
had left for America, on much the same mis-
sion : whether lie will go on to Europe de-
pends a good deal upon the hold Uncle Sam’s
musicians got upon him. If you ask the
artistic brethren how the widespread Wun-
derlich business can spare two-thirds of
them, they will probably tell you in two
words—“staff partnership.” Departmental
heads have all a direct interest in the com-
pany’s harvest.
I)r. Elsie Dalyell was another good Aus-
tralian that the Makura brought home this
time—for keeps, she hopes. The noble
woman-medico wants her own laud to have
the benefit of the knowledge that 10 years’
strenuous work abroad has given her. She
was here, just to see her people, in 1920,
after strenuous service in Serbia and Saloni-
ka. Since her heroic war work, for which
she has a string of decorations, she has de-
voted herself to the study of children, and
has specialised in nutrition.
Mrs. Earle Page (this is her portrait) is
really a mathematical problem. She being
the better half of the doctor, who is rather
less than half a
Prime Minister, how
much of a Prime
Minister is the lady?
Whatever the an-
swer, she is becom-
ing reconciled to it,
though she hopes it
won’t keep her from
looking after her
home and the chil-
dren. They are the
little bit of Austra-
lia that count for
most. Still, she has
managed quite well
so far; she helped
her capable husband
to reach and fill the
place of unquestioned
leader of the little
Grafton community;
she was his lieutenant (and sometimes his
captain) in all his political campaigning;
and lately she has been very busy helping
to run the Melbourne conference held in
the interests of farmers’ wives. She is the
eldest daughter of the Blunts, of Mosman.
He, of course, is a Sydney graduate, and
headed the honors list in his year.
Mrs. Garvin was to have been the lone
lioness of Sydney High School Old Girls
at the Women’s Club, where they congre-
gated era masse to bid her farewell before
she went off on her journey to London ; but
Dr. Elsie Dal.vell dropped in, too, and her
old mistress beamed to share her honors
with such a distinguished pupil. Miss Whit-
field received the guests. Mrs. W. H. Read
was a cheerful lift attendant, and Amy
(Mack) Harrison the keeper of the door.
It was a cheery gathering. The company let
the dignity of matron, doctor, writer and
poet and artist fade away into the past, and
seemed just a happy, chattering band of
girls again. A horseshoe of flowers and a
posy were farewell gifts to the president.
The W.C.T.U. has put its two biggest
guns in action. Mrs. Carvosso and Miss
Adie Robertson opened fire in Ashfield last
week. The Goodlet Institute was packed,
and the approving “Hears, hears” and shrill
hurrahs demonstrated that the cocktail’s
most implacable enemies are feminine. Adie
Robertson got a neat one in on a timid ma.e
interjector. ‘’Didn't you see traces of trouble
through shutting up all the public-houses?”
was the query he managed to squeeze in dur-
ing a recital of the health, happiness and
prosperity U.S.A. was enjoying through the
absence of booze. "Yes, I did. I saw one
place absolutely ruined, falling into decay
for the need of business!” There was a
swift intake of breath followed by a horrible
hush in the tense feminine audience. “That
place was the Inebriates’ Institute at Den-
ver. It was up for sale in allotments for
workers’ homes.” The audience breathed
again, and the male worm hid inside his
hunched-up shoulders. The campaigners
took their ammunition to Eppiug in the
evening, and Mosman was the scene of
action the following morning, Dr. Arthur’s
wife lending her dignified presence as chair-
woman. Gordon heard all about the great
things Prohibition has done for Canada and
TJ.S.A. during the afternoon. It was a
worthy effort; but some travellers tell as
good a story for the other side. Most of us
see what we want to. And lucky for some
of us that it is so. A lot of us would never
marry if it were otherwise.
Jean Gerardy brought something much
more precious than his mammoth Strad —an
Australian wife.
She was Amelia
McQuade, and will
be remembered as a
clever amateur
pianiste, one of the
late Sydney Moss’s
best pupils. Her
parents’ residence at
Potts Point, Bom-
ara, now occupied by
a big wharf, was one
of Sydney’s show
homes, and boasted
the biggest private
music-room in the
S t a t e. Amelia’s
mother built Her
Majesty’s Theatre
after it was burned
down 20 years ago.
Now, well-gilded,
she dwells in London. Her daughter lias
been away from Australia for IT years and
a bit, most of the time world-touring with
hubby. A tall, generously-moulded Austra-
lian, with an embracing smile and a hearty
manner, she is full of almost. childlike won-
derment at the growth of her home town.
Her first outside visit after arrival was to
Taronga Park. When she was a little girl
she loved the Zoo, then at Moore Park, better
than any other treat that could be devised,
so she went off to see if there was anything
left of her old love. She was enraptured—
voted Taronga the most beautiful Zoo in the
world.
When really at home the Cerardys live
at Spa, where King Edward was wont to
take the waters, but now famous for being
the scene of a Peace Conference. During
the war the Kaiser and a few of his prize
war-lords made themselves comfortable in
the best homes of the residents, while Jean
Gerardy went off to serve his country, and
his wife put in her anxious days in London
with mother.
Little Mrs. Harold Norrie was the chauf-
feuse who drove Archbishop Cattaneo to the
Mater Misericordise Hospital to give a bene-
diction on the three days’ fete that finished
on Saturday. The Delegate smiled his
way through an avenue of bright-faced girls
from Monte Saint Angelo School, who
formed a guard of honor. “You prayed for
rain yesterday.” he reminded the gathering,
“and the good God showed you what He
could do last night; but all your hearts are
rejoicing, I know, that the answer didn’t
come to-day to spoil all your pretty things.”
Mrs. Leahy, Mrs. Grieve, Miss Lorimer, Miss
Corlis and Mrs. Nutte were the power be-
hind the busy committee.
Ken Richards gave youngest sister Doro-
thy into the care of George Arthur, a
tall Tasmanian, last week. Canon Howard
Lea put the usual questions, under St.
Mark’s sheltering dome. The wedding
draperies—-ivory satin, chenille-embroidered
—showed a flush of pink beneath the train,
which was draped with exquisitely fine lace.
May Smith and Sybil Youl (niece of the
bridegroom) and the bride’s three pretty little
nieces, Betty, Patricia and Pamela Richards,
were visions in rose and silver as attendant
maids. The elder girls wore bandeaus of
flowers, and the children veils of pink tulle
and wreaths that accorded tastefully with
their panniered frocks. Mrs. Richards after-
wards had the company to dinner at the
Queen’s Club, and from there the bride and
’groom left for a motor tour of the South
Coast. Mr. Arthur has given up his inter-
ests in Apple-land for a home near Scone.
Two Wagga residents decided to make a
double team last week in their own church,
St. John’s, and Archdeacon Pike officiated
at the harnessing. The bride was Iv. G.
Flett’s only daughter Mary, and the ’groom
Sidney Hiram, soldier-son of W. R. Eyles,
of Baarmutha. The bride gave her promise
from the shelter of a tulle veil that covered
her ivory-brocaded gown. The bridegroom's
sister and her cousin, Miss Swann, of Mere-
wether, held her bouquet while the. ring was
slipped on. The reception was at the
’groom’s parents’ home.
The H. A. Sutherlands, of Wyuna sta-
tion (Q.). and daughter Wyuna were
among the Narkunda’s trippers to the old,
uneasy world. They have been enjoying a
round of festivities since their arrival in
Sydney—a kind of tit-for-tat feteing. But
the happiest gathering was that given at
the Wentworth to their old Queensland
friends.
Mrs. Martin Macadam and her daughter,
Mrs. Tony Hirshell, were on the same liner.
They also had many tea-parties. Mrs. A.
Wallace Weihen gave the final flutter at
Farmer’s for mother and sister.
Woollahra’s Mayor has left the problem of
Woollahra’s White Way to be solved by the
aldermen, while he takes Mrs. Foster to
ascertain if there is a better ’ole in Europe
than his old-fashioned municipality. They,
too, belong to the Narkunda’s big company.
The mayoral lady had enough parties to
make her shudder at the sight of a cream-
cake for months and months.
And Mrs. F. Floyd joined the Narkunda at
Melbourne. She is to visit the Ewan
Frazers, old friends who were big Woollahra
identities in the days when Woollahra was
the stronghold of Sydney’s Sassiety.
The 'Wentworth Cafe is being all dressed
up in its new lighting scheme to introduce
the Easter festivities —no, Mrs. Maclurcan
didn’t bring it from America. Son Charles,
the radio man, designed and supervised the
installation, and just had it ready for
mamma’s return with —it must be confessed
• —something new in colored fittings.
Little James Walker, diminutive for his 10
years, stepped on to the big platform at
the Town Hall one evening iast week, and
seated himself at the grand piano with the
confident ease of a Paderewski. The little
hands that looked as if half-an-octave’s
stretch would be a miracle, performed won-
ders of old classics and modern music. Yet
“The Australian Mozart” has only had seven
months’ tuition. After the recital he was
the lion at a supper party given by his
parents at the Burlington.
Lawyer Ralph Houston and his wife,
having "had 25 years of connubial bliss, gave
a dinner-dance at the Wentworth on Fri-
day. Over the bubbles 50 guests wished
them another quarter-century’s happiness.
Commodore Edwards and his brown-eyed
wife had additional evidence of their popu-
larity when the Ormonde touched Tasmania.
Those of the fleet who were still in Hobart
came down to give them first the glad hand
and then a luncheon party.
A Sun cable stating that “the widowed
Countess of Westmorland will begin her
career as a professional soprano at a concert
on Easter Sunday in London” has some Aus-
tralian interest. The mother of Sir Archi-
bald Weigall, late of S. Aus., is a daughter
of one Earl of Westmorland, and the first
wife of the Earl who died the other day was
Lord Loughborough’s aunt. The new pro.
is a parson’s daughter, who sang to the sol-
diers in Paris and London during the war,
and while doing so met her sexagenarian
husband.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Though too peaceful to trail his coat and not yet
well enough to wave a shillelagh, Sir Matthew
made his first appearance since his illness at the St.
Patrick’s Day celebration in the Exhibition grounds.
His Ex. has lived much in Ireland, and his tact
never fails. Archbishops and such surrounded him,
and the wearin’ of the green was proclaimed by
Eugene Boland at the concert in the evening. In
the morning the worthy saint, with his nice silk
snakes ’broidered on the banner by Sisters of
Mercy, wandered through Brisbane streets with a
following of hundreds of boys from the It.O. colleges.
Early in the week Sir Matt., with Mrs. Falkner
and Elfrida Walsh, and Captain Hammond to look
after the time-table, went up the North Coast line
to Maryborough and Gympie. Dr. Thompson acted
as guide and philosopher. Civic receptions, a meet-
ing of the Gympie Geographicals, lantern slides
and billy-boiling at Eel Creek were in the varied
programme.
Barbara Sisley left the Elite Theatre after her
recital the other night with a leather travelling-
trunk and a wallet of bank notes, gifts of admirers
and the Shakspeare Society, to accompany her to
England for a holiday trip. Nell Douglas Graham
takes up the mantle the elocutionist lets fall.
The “20th-century woman,” in long frocks and
short frocks, at work and at play, was raked fore
and aft at the Women’s Club this week. The heated
discussion ended amiably by the members deciding
that she was quite a nice person whether froeked in
leaves or from bargain sales. Yellow and pink
gerberas and bowls of roses proclaimed the fact that
Olive Graham, of Toowoomba, who is one of a
family of pretty girls, is shortly to bestow her
hand in holy matrimony.
Major-General Spencer-Brown handed the cake
figuratively, and the silver cake-basket actually, to
Miss Dix, who is leaving the R.S.S.I.L. to take up
another engagement—signed on in a church register.
This gift was from the employees of the League. A
silver tea-service and tray indicated the approval of
the League itself.

MISSES MONKE DOVLE
Phones Cent 1533, 11609
Lady Stradbroke fed the local pen women
at Stonington last week. It was a cheery
gathering, the Countess having set the bail
rolling by admitting that she felt in her
most indiscreet mood. “But,” she inter-
polated guilefully, “I feel quite safe with only
my own sex around, who, I know, will not
betray my indiscretional utterances, although
mere man Avon’t let himself believe that
woman can keep a secret.” The hostess,
who has swept her front locks fiercely back
from her Avell-defined eyebrows, was an inky
streak of black velvet like a note of interro-
gation ; and Miss Currie, who lined the com-
pany up for the official entry, was also in
black. After the grapes Lady Strad. got
on her feet, and with a really commendable
flow of speech said quite a lot about what
she thought of Australia and its inhabitants.
She and the Earl are feeling the weight of
the official chain somewhat, and are looking
forward to their six months of freedom.
Lord Stradbroke ran into the first flight of
press ladies in the front hall. He hurriedly
explained that he was bound for another
function, obviously fearful that they might
think he was going to join their shivoo. One
seemed to hear him gasping “Perish the
thought!”
St. John’s, Toorak, w r as packed for the
wedding of Peg Forrester and Jim Fair-
bairn. Unluckily, Lent had censored all
decorative effect beyond the war flags which
are always there. Vicar Law officiated, and
Charlie Forrester handed his only chick over.
She was hung Avith floAving folds of satiny
whiteness and a satin sash, buckled on the
offside with brilliants. Mrs. Stanley Argyle
had lent her famous mellow lace veil, and
it was worn with silver attachments rein-
forced by an orange-blossom drape over each
ear. A sheaf of tiger-lilies weighted one
arm. Lorna Sargood, Vere de Bava.v and
the bridegroom’s flapper sister Betty brides-
maided in pinky yelloAV like three appetising
apricots. They had fur and brilliants on
the croAVns of their broAvn hats and bunches
of dahlias in autumn tintings clasped in their
hands. Mrs. Forrester witnessed the sacri-
fice in cloudy grey under a black hat-brim,
and there Avas a great gathering of the Fair-
bairn and Armytage clans at the health-
drinking at Illawarra. Here ex-Senator
Ceorge spoke a .few well-chosen words. After
the cake had been cut the contracting pair
set out to open their honeymoon tour with
a week at Woolamanata, the family squat-
tage, and when that is over they are off to
Honolulu. The goirig-away costume Avas of
faAvn with a lace droop on a black velvet hat.
Last Friday night Mrs. Norman Brookes
gave a jazz scramble under the patronage
of Lady Stradbroke. The volatile Countess
trailed her black velvet with the tulle fins,
and kept the draught off her neck with pearls
and moonstones. A Vanload of beautiful
blooms had been ordered in to harmonise
with the surroundings. Mrs. Norman took
the salute in upholsterings of mauve and
silver, heightened by a pardonable flush of
satisfaction at having roped in a Avhole den
of lions. Lady Stanley had ransacked the
solar system for the ornaments on her
sombre goAvn. The Irvine dame Avas seen
rising from a cloud of grey chiffonery, and
Mrs. Pitt Rivers struck an agreeable note
in green, fenced in with brilliants. The
Prime Minister, who does not allow his poli-
tical activities to encroach on his social
engagements, brought his lady, who glit-
tered as fiercely as an undimmed motor-
headlight in massed draperies of gold tissue.
Mrs. Emmerton, Avho was there to help her
daughter, smiled pleasingly over a sea of
inky georgette that broke in golden surf
about the equator. Lawrence Grossmith
strolled in after the show, and his wife flut-
tered under the wing of pretty little Mrs.
Fan Dango Mackay.
The grand-opera temperament was as sub-
dued as a purring kitten in the Oriental
lounge on Friday, when Mrs. Pohlman dis-
pensed tea to the soloists of the Sistine
Choir. The tables glowed Avith flowers, and
the plates of cakes, etc., were controlled by
quaint little traffic cops done in the best
Esther and Betty Paterson manner. Amy
Castles nibbled a lettuce sandwich, but
firmly refused the ice cream. Her sister
Eileen sparkled above flame-colored frock-
ing, and some brand-new furs of the fox
family. Towards the end of the shivoo Mrs.
W. Macleod, of Sydney, avlio is resting in
Melbourne, looked in to renew acquaintance
all round. *
Vice-regality’s association with Masonry
lias undoubtedly had the effect of stimulat-
ing interest in the craft in this State. Its
strength is now equal to that of the A.N.A.
—32,000. The display at the installation
of Lord Stradbroke for the second time as
G.M. was dazzling.
When at Cowes Governor Stradbroke
lounged about in a soft shirt and an old
pair of khaki pants, and her Ex. had the
novel experience of bathing without half-a-
dozen cameras playing on her. One day the
pair had a little picnic on the beach. The
Earl gathered sticks, lit a fire, and grilled
chops for a lunch v. hich was subsequently
eaten under a large umbrella. On another
occasion their Exes, so lar abandoned their
lofty state as to send out a maid to beg tea
from a neighbor. But the Stradbroke in-
fants were not allowed to paddle with the
Herd, and if they tried to there was always
a nurse to wave the plebeians away.
The Movie Ball at Carlyons bounced off
with a lurid Selznick film drama entitled “One
Week of Love.” It might more justly have been
styled “The Seven Days’ Terror.” beginning
as it did in Zolaesque vein and ending on
an Annie Swan note. W. W. Duff was Post,
and versatile Tommy Cochran Master of
Ceremonies and Checker of Invitations. Mrs.
Pitt Rivers was there, her golden head
gleaming out of a cloud of black chiffonery,
and with her were Nonie Wiltshire, Aileen
Bell and a posy of gent.-helps. Mrs. Rus-
sell Clarke had mammoth mauve flowers em-
bedded in her black upholsterings; Mrs.
Sydney Sturt, whose flame-colored curtain-
ings suggested a stick of sealing-wax, had
latticed her ears with grapes; and one plump
charmer looked like a Spanish tango-dancer
sheeted in a vivid silk-embroidered shawl.
The Women Automobilists weighted their
club’s banking account with a frivol at the
Oriental, lent by Miss Mcßae. The poker
and bridge enthusiasts gambled in the dining-
hall and side parlors, and the others listened
to the music over Winter Garden teacups.
Mrs. H. J. Robertson, the organiser, con-
tributed a couple of clear-toned contralto
solos; Edyth Harrhy did her bit; Vera Ben-
son was there on a ticket-of-leave from the
Tivoli; and Gertrude Alger fiddled soulfully
on a genuine Guarnerius. Mrs. Robertson
spread green silk with brown lace hangings
which whispered of early autumn. _ Mrs.
Angus loomed pleasantly in brown, with no-
thing but her smile showing under a lace-
draped hat. Billy Hughes’s daughter-in-law,
over from the Harbor to see our deposed
satrap unload his Ivew ftlrnishings into his
Sassafras mia mia before : transferring the
lot to Sydney, stepped in with Mrs. Row-
lands, who was attractively boxed in new
navy autumn coatings. Mrs. Ted Dyson was
also in autumn attire, and she provided an
artistically-produced trio of ballads.
The bright young Australian here depicted
by Rembrandt is Ruth Philips, a gifted
Gippslander who,
after a brief career
as a trained nurse,
came to Melbourne
to test her rich
dramatic soprano
voice, which had
been polished in odd
moments when cap
{fed apron had been
put aside. Now,
after a fresh course
of throat tuition by
Thfophilus Roberts,
Nurse Ruth finds
herself behind the
footlights with
Claude Dampier. He
enthuses over the
little Gippslander’s
possibilities; and
Adelaide has called
her blessed. She can play with the piano
almost as cleverly as she can release her
top C.
Berwick got busy last week to reduce the
Soldiers’ Hall bill with an Allied Nations
fete. The place was over-run with petti-
coated brigands, disguised as Japs, Belgians
and so on. The lady-helps in the tea-drink-
ing section flew flags in front instead of
pinnies. Mrs. Fred. Barker shouldered the
secretarial job with Miss Edwardes, who
also gave Mrs. Cole, the vicar’s wife, a hand
in her British sector. And, finally, there
was a one-step in the Soldiers’ Hall, which
had been dressed up for the event by R.
Pinkerton.
Charity, and particularly the Children’s
Hospital, will benefit by the death of Mrs.
Naylor, who had lived for so long in her big,
old-fashioned home at South Yarra. She
lost first her only child —a daughter—and
then her husband. After that the accumu-
lation of wealth became the chief purpose
in the lonely woman’s life.
Mrs. De Jersey Grut, who died last week
after a brief illness, had been accustomed
to spend most of her time by her invalid hus-
band’s bath-chair. She simply bubbled over
with cheeriness in the attempt to make him
forget he. was a sick man—Their son and
daughter are both settled across seas—the
former in Canada; his sister, Mrs. Duyon
Purchas, in the U.S.A.
Miss Finlay, matron of Melbourne Gram-
mar, who had been grievously ill for manj
months, first in a private hospital and later
at her own home in Warrandyte, has passed
over the hill. She was more than usually
popular with Grammar boys, and none the
less so for the fact that she left them in
charge of an understudy while she devoted
herself to the care of the Anzac sick and
wounded in Egypt and afterwards in I? ranee,
practically for the duration of the war. She
got her nursing experience at Melbourne
Hospital.
Maud Grantham and Nellie Billings sailed
by the Suevic last" week. They intend to
be away for at least 12 months. Maud’s
mother and father travel with her, and
Nellie Billings chaperones her pet pupil,
Katie Helling. The corner of the deck
where the party said farewell looked like a
rose show.
Mona Pepyat, an
unusually promising
young actress, pleads
tor notice in the ad-
joining photo by
Ruskin. A few
weeks back she
played the somewhat
worldly Mrs. Wilton
in Ibsen’s “John Ga-
briel Borkman” at
the Playhouse, and
she is now excited
at the prospect of
having to throw her-
self at an amateur
John Tanner as Ann
Whitefield in “Man
and Superma n.”
This will not happen
for a while, however,
and meantime Miss
I’epyat is cultivating her popularity as a
Shakspearean recitalist, and finds quite a
demand on her services. At the Ballarat
competitions she launched out for the “open
scene” as Madame X in her first sodden
and dishevelled appearance as the mistress
of the villain Daroque. This enterprise cost
the damsel her previous obscurity, and she
shot into notice as winner of the first
prize.
Captain Keppel Palmer skidded on to the
sick-list last week, and so into a private
hospital.
Australia’s first Van Eyck is a small but
excellent sample of the work of the 15th-
century painter. It cost the Felton Trustees
about £405 per square inch. Van Eyck por-
trays the Virgin Mother in the fashionable
garments of the time, showing the Christ
Child as a nicely-bound illustrated volume.
Opulence is apparent in the well-cut bodice,
the flowing ample robe. In Van Eyck’s
time —1433—Protestanism was spreading
fast, and it is possible that this portrayal of
the Virgin was a sardonic jest, enjoyed by
the artist and those of his peers “with eyes
to see.” Dutch painters liked subtle jests
in their pictures. Holbein punned on liis
name with a forced perspective of a skull as
a signature, signifying “Hollow bone.”
Through shaking up the Zoo Council, Act-
ing-Premier McPherson may see the whole
place remodelled; and his action in setting
up a Botanical Gardens Trust is likely to
result in complete reorganisation of the staff
there. In the course of his Haroun A 1
Raschid peregrinations, the Acting-Premier
noted how disgracefully the Ferntree Gully
main park was kept, and he growled. Then
it was discovered that indifferent councillors
and a couple of octogenarian ex-legislators
were the guardians. A live wire is to be
introduced there, too, and garbage and rotten
footbridges will disappear. Not knowing
when the uneasy head may pop in, those who
run Government and semi-Government con-
cerns are making things more ship-shape.
And, generally, not before it was time.
From an Australian in London: —
Parson West, of St.. Dunstan’s in the East, in this
village, who spent 12 years in Adelaide and Melbourne,
gathers Australia together every January 26 in his
church, and after 15 years the function has grown to
large proportions. This year the once Archbishop
of Brisbane, now Bishop of Salisbury, preached the
sermon, and collected more attention than the Dean
of St. Paul’s, who performed a year ago. Bishop
Donaldson praised Australia ‘ for her care of subject
races, and £4O was collected for the Pinjarra Child
Emigration Scheme. Ex-Governor Sir Arthur Law-
ley (First Lord of the Admiralty) and the High
Commissioner —they were both present—have been
able to pull departmental strings, and a grant is now
coming from the Oversea Settlement Board. Mrs.
Ada Crossley Muecke came out of retirement to sing
—as well as. ever —to her friends at Clothworkers Hall
for the same cause. This was a prelude to the
big crush at Australia House to shake hands with
the Prince. '
Dorothy Goodfellow, a writing lady, is in
Melbourne busying herself with fiction maga-
zines. She is much travelled, and her tales
of China, Canada and the States make her
good company. She wrote the .scenario for
one of Segsue Havakawa’s four Chinese
plays which are being filmed in New York.
Oliver Winter-Irving has pluck. Only a
few months ago he lost part of his arm: now
he is not only driving his car, but playing
polo.
It looks as though the once palatial
Osborne House, at North Shore, Corio Bay,
will soon be on the market again. If the
submarines are scrapped the Geelong base,
with the beautiful home where squatter
Philip Russell once lived, will no longer be
wanted by the sadly diminished navy. The
house and extensive grounds several years
ago passed to the Defence Department as
Australia’s first Naval College. During and
after the war it was used as a home for
convalescent warriors, and later for active-
service nurses who were on the disabled list.
Then the formation of the submarine base
gave it a new mission. A stone’s throw 7
away are the Federal Woollen Mills, which
the Hughes Ministry recently tried to sell.
A year or so ago it was intended to establish
a seaplane base there also. That scheme
fell through, few people in .authority appa-
rently having much enthusiasm about the
defence of Australia after G. F. Pearce had
fixed it up at Washington that there would
be no more wars.
A buxom, upstanding, long-striding young
matron has just been visited by Mr. Stork
for the second time. Her family, owing to a
proclivity for burdening their babies with
bunches of names, have been dubbed the
Alphabeticals. The Christian name of this
one’s first-born makes the initials A.8.C.;
the new arrival is to be D.E.F. A woman
pal said the other day: ‘‘Don’t make me
godmother just yet—l’ll promise to be
sponsor for X.Y.Z.”
In 20 minutes Tattersall’s Club raised
£6OO for endowing a cot at the Children’s
Hospital. It is not the first time this has
been done. When flush, T. Mcßook and his
cousins are generous.
The Grand Censor at Court must spend
sleepless nights sorting things out now 7 that
the English divorce courts polish off several
hundred cases to the hour. Buckingham
Palace declares the divorced taboo, as it did
in the days of old Queen Vic. Before that
the untied knot wasn’t common enough to
worry the drawing-rooms. In those times
a duel and a neat little rapier-thrust dis-
posed of the awkward corner of the eternal
triangle, and the best man in the sword play
came off with honor and walked in the sun
of royal favor. A modern divorce case slurs
all who take part in it. There is so much
stirring of mud in the publicity of the court
and the press that it spatters over the sinner
and the sinned-against alike. The woman in
particular, whether she comes off with a
decree nicey or a decree nasty, goes under a
cloud to the end. Perhaps, for us, the dewy-
morning duel was the best way out. The
name of the w r oman-in-the-case was not blaz-
oned forth, and her social safety was guarded
by the likelihood of still another duel if the
talk got above a whisper.
A few remarks from Adelaide: —
The University staff went gay at the Grand
Central, when the Chancellor and Miss Murray, Vice-
Chancellor Mitchell and his daughter, Mrs. Darnley
Naylor and Mrs. Harold Davies did the honors of a
tea-party arranged by some of the magnificoes of the
place ,to enable newcomers to meet their colleagues.
Miss Murray and Professor Mitchell received, amongst
others, the MacKellar Stewarts and Harvey John-
stones, the Coleman Phillipsons, R. W. Chapmans,
T. G. Osboriis, Douglas Mawsons, Brailsford Robert-
sons, E. H. Rennies and J. B. Clelands.
There has been a flutter here over the marriage of
.lean Anstruther-Gray to Lord Stratheden and Camp-
bell at the Guards’ Chapel, London. Before her
marriage the bride’s mother was Clare Tennant,
daughter of the late Andrew Tennant, of Glenclg,
and one of the most decorative of the younger set
in the days of the Kintore regime. The Novars and
Lord Kintore were among the guests, and the honey-
moon was spent at a house in Hampshire lent by
our present G.-G., Lord Forster.
The Nestor removed the Joseph Vercos and J. H.
Gosses. The Vercos are bound for the 800th anni-
versary of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, at which
festivities he is to be this State’s representative.
His going will leave a big gap on the Red Cross
committee, whose members were bidden by Lady
Bridges to Government House to say their good-
byes and wish him and his wife good luck. Aboard
the Narkunda were Mrs. A. E. Joyner and Mrs. Riseh-
bieth —Westralia’s delegates to the Congress of the
International Women’s Suffrage Alliance at Rome.
Mrs. Carlyle McDonnell and Mrs. T. R. Bowman
are this State’s representatives at the Maternity Bonus
Conference in Melbourne —the latter as spokeswoman
for the National Council of Women and the former as
delegate from the Women’s Non-party Association.
Nora Stewart and G. M. Anstey are the god-
parents Of a dance club which is to be christened
the Winter Club. It will meet on Tuesday evenings
at the Osborne Hall.
Life is still mostly tennis —though polo is estab-
lishing itself as a rival at the Birkalla ground. Mrs.
Patterson was one of the players on Wednesday. In
the Mixed Doubles Championship against N. Thomas
and Mrs. Rischbieth she and her husband scored an
easy win in two sets. He did most of the work.
In spite of a dry summer, Mount Lofty raised its
usual gorgeous collection of flowers for its show on
Saturday, with dahlias, petunias, phlox and asters
as the prize exhibits. Miss Harriet Stirling spoke
the opening word or two.

LET
MICK SIMMONS
DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
It is always hard to pick the winner of the
A.J.C. Doncaster Handicap, and if the going is heavy
at Randwick on Saturday the task will be more
difficult than ever. There is no Beauford in the
held, nor has anything been thrown in. A decent
three-year-old with a light weight would be worth
considering, but all the three-year-olds have been
carefully attended to. So have the older good-class
horses—Julia Grey (9st. 61b.), Salatis (9st. 61b.),
Easingwold (9st. 31b.), Glenacre (9st.) and the rest.
And no one can say that the weight-adjuster has
taken liberties with Sir Maitland (Bst. 91b.), Etive
(Bst. 31b.). Fleuriste (Bst.) or All Gold (7st.
131 b.). About the best-handicapped horses in the
field are Golden Treasure (7st. 21b.), who beat
Whittier on Saturday at an advantage of 101 b. as
compared with their Doncaster weights, and
the Victorian Imputation. For a four-year-
old mare that ran well in the Newmarket, won the
Bourke Handicap and ran second to Stare in the
10-furlong Stand Handicap when the son of Earlston
was at his best, 7st. 21b. is a nice weight. Imputa-
tion has shown a liking for a dead track, and this
page will have her on its side. The other mare may
not see out a fast-run Randwick mile ; Sir Maitland
gave her a long start and a beating over the last of
seven furlongs on March 17. All Gold was fourth in the
Newmarket when evidently short of a gallop, and ran
away with a six-furlong handicap a week later, when
hacked for a king’s ransom. One recalls that he
won a mile two-year-old race at Randwick in heavy
going and that he was leaving Gilray at the end of
a seven-furlong welter a year ago—in's last effort
on the course. If he can reproduce this form he
should be among the leaders at the distance; but
on his showing at Rosehill on Saturday one must
reject him in favor of Duke Isinglass (Bst. 71b.), a
seasoned animal with a fast finishing run, who has
apparently come on since he won the Challenge
Stakes. On the strength of his two seconds
to Rostrum at headquarters Fleuriste must have a
chance, but Sir Maitland, who was only half-a-lerngth
behind Connolly’s horse in the Epsom, is meeting
him on 91b. better terms. And Sir Maitland, after
being well back early in the race (Fleuriste always
had a good position), was travelling the faster of
the pair at the finish. Nothing looks likely to beat
that lot unless it is Etive, always dangerous at
Randwick. The Bulletin's No. 1 vote goes to
Duke Isinglass, with Imputation and Sir Maitland as
second and third preferences.
Victorian trainers are strongly represented in the
Sydney Cup. Their most-fancied candidate is King
Ingoda (9st.), but if the King misses there are The
Cypher (Bst. 71b.), Caserta (Bst. 61b.), The Rover
(Bst. 51b.), Mufti (Bst.), Sir Andrew (7st. 131 b.)
and Heir Apparent (7st. 121 b.) to put in claims.
On the weights Mufti ought to account for both
King Ingoda and The Cypher, seeing that she has
only 51b. more than she carried into third place
in the Melbourne Cup. in whicli she was finishing
stoutly, whereas King Ingoda will hump 271 b. more
and the three-year-old 231 b. more. But she is
only a little thing, and one bump would settle
her chance. Heir Apparent is built on more ragged
lines and is in much better condition than when
he ran in the Victorian Cups. It is not to be for-
gotten that this aristocratically bred customer has
beaten Harvest King as a three-year-old, and Whittier
as a four-year-old, and that he shaped capitally in
the V.A.T.C. St. Leger of his year. He has a
luxurious weight and his Hawkesbury Handicap win
was most impressive. On paper the Sydney division is
not so attractive as the Victorian lot, though Speciality
(9st. 51b.), Prince Cox (Bst. 91b.), Prince Charles
(Bst. 71b.), Even Song (7st. 81b.) and Bitalli (7st.
51b.) will help to make a race of it. Even Song
was this paper’s early pick, but her appearance at
Rosehill on March 17, respectably as she ran in
the seven-furlong handicap won by Naharadan, sug-
gested that she required a good deal more work.
Since then, instead of getting it, the mare has
had trouble with her feet. To sum up, Heir
Apparent is the writer’s first choice, and Mufti his
second, with a reservation in favor of Even Song if
she gallops decently on the first day.
With Beauford scratched for all engagements
Furious may prove the most reliable w.f.a. per-
former. She was the best three-year-old of a very
good year, and seems to have completely recovered
from her very severe Spring campaign. As for the
two-year-olds, one expects Black Scot to repeat his
November victory over The Monk and to settle King
Carnival’s hash as well. And Caserta is likely to
prove that his poor form in the Herbies was all
wrong.
The old Hawkesbury R. C. has held its
last couple of meetings at Rosehill, and very
profitable meetings they have been. There was a
great crowd on Saturday, and well-backed winners
were plentiful: also the going was uncommonly
fast. Golden Treasure (5 to 2) won the first divi-
sion of the six-furlong Flying Handicap in lmin.
134 sec.; Inia’s Boy (10’s) the second division in
lmin. 13sec. Heir Apparent (4’s) ran his Hawkes-
bury Handicap, 11 furlongs, in 2min. 191 sec., and
Salatis (7 to 4) landed the seven-furlong Highweight
Handicap, with list. 81b. up, in lmin. 2545ec.,
and finished on three legs at that. In the retrospect,
it was rotten policy to ask a good horse, which had
already had a lot of racing, to carry 1621 b. a
week before the Doncaster, in which he had an un-
doubted chance. But the stable thought it a cer-
tainty, and so it looked when the game giant ranged
alongside D. U. Seaton’s Joseph (Bst. 91b.), at
the entrance to the straight. But Joseph refused
to be shaken off, and it was only in the last stride
that the big fellow shoved half his head in front.
Salatis got a rousing cheer tor his courage, and
Lewis for his fine finish, but the overtasked horse
came in limping, and at the moment of writing he is
labelled an unlikely starter at Randwick.
Lewis had a much more comfortable ride on Heir
Apparent. Always in a good position, the handsome
bay never seemed to be going at his top, and when
the veteran moved on him he ran past Cool Light
and Tremolo without the slightest difficulty. David
headed the unplaced division, and Speciality (favorite
at 7 to 4) finished fairly well, but neither ever looked
like troubling the winner.
The best Doncaster trial was done by Golden Treasure.
She came on resolutely when Whittier tackled her, and
there was a length between them at the finish. Still, the
Caulfield Cup and V.R.C. Derby winner has never been
regarded as a six-furlong horse. Inia’s Boy’s per-
formance was also smart, but too much use was made
of Braehead, who had 9st. 71b. to carry. Behind this
pair and Wrangle were All Gold, Soorak, Syceonelle
and Cliffdale. The three-vear-olds shaped very dis-
appointingly, and although All Gold was fourth,
neither his appearance nor his finish was impressive.
He will have to come on a good deal if he is to win
the Doncaster.
“Harold Hardupp”: So many favorites had
rolled home, inadvertently perhaps, at Robbery Park
that Bliff was 30 notes to the good when the last
race arrived. Rejecting my advice to stow some
of it away, he put £2O on Fishanehips at 6 to 1.
My remonstrances only increased his pot-valor,
and he took other wagers about Fishanehips until
his last shilling had gone. Still, he was quite
satisfied; he reckoned
that about £2OO was
staring him in the
face. And Fishanchips
flattered his hopes. As
it reached the distance,
a neck behind ihe
leader, Bliff’s excite-
ment burst into song
—or rather a sort of
chant —w hi c h ran:
“There he is ! Look at
the beaut! Fishan-
chips ! Fishanchips!
Come on! Come on,
you beaut! Didn’t I
tell ver? He walks
home ! lie walks home,
walks home—w a 1 k s
home. No: I walk
home!” he finished
abruptly. The race was
over.
R. BAILIE,
Sydney horse-
trainer.
Oxford won the inter-’Varsity boatrace
bv three-quarters of a length last Saturday, after
“never looking- like being beaten,” in the cable-
man’s phrase. None the less it was obviously a
gruelling- race, and Cambridge, although theirs was
a stern chase after the first half-mile, had enough
left in them for a game through futile challenge at
Barnes Bridge, which left winners as well as losers
pretty well “all in.” Apart from this the most
notable feature of this year’s contest seems to have
been a fine-weather crowd estimated at three-quarters
of a million. A few months ago it was mentioned
that some professorial ex-oarsman had designed a
new T craft for Oxford, of which great things were
hoped in theory, but anparentlv they didn’t material-
ise in practice, for the masterpiece was eventually
discarded for last year’s boat. This is Oxford’s first
win for 10 years, during five of which the war held
up the annual struggle. The tally now stands at
40 for the Dark Blues, and 34 for the Light, with
one dead-heat.
J. O. Anderson, who is in great form at
present, smashed his way through the City of Sydnev
singles without striking trouble in any quarter." His
opponent in the final was G. Ollivier, the Maorilander,
hut Ollivier made things easv for his opponent by
weak placing. Also, he plainly felt his 35 years.
Ollivier was M.L. singles champion as far back as
1911. Aubrey Sieler, the promising rountrv player,
had an indifferent partner in the doubles, which went
to Anderson and N. Peach, but he took the mixed
doubles with little Miss Gray, of Goulburn. Miss
Gray, however, was beaten by Miss Lance in the
ladies’ singles, after putting up a great fight in the
first two sets.
A. AY. Situs, the lithe Maorilander, who
has made an excellent impression on Sydney tennis
critics, is ambidextrous. He cultivated the habit
years ago when a broken collarbone ruined his
favorite left-hand smash. He still uses the left, prin-
cipally for ground strokes, but brings the light
into play when the ball rises above shoulder
height. He bounded into notice in Sydney by defeat-
ing Norman Peach in the match M.L. v. Metropolis,
and taking a set from Anderson by fine baseline
play. Peach had his revenge last week in the City
of Sydney singles, but there wasn’t much in r.
Sims has youth and the-right temperament, and only
needs practice against the champions to become
one of them himself.
South Aus., of course, took on more than
it could manage in playing N.S.W. and Victoria at
tennis at once. Rice, Kalins, Dive and F. Peach
beat the Central State by seven rubbers to five: and
a Victorian six, headed by Patterson, won by 11 to
S-. But the local ladies accounted for a strong
Victorian team, 7 to 6; and there were both men
and women left good enough to give two Westralian
teams a bad heating. It took Patterson all his time
to settle Hone, who was, in fact, once or twice
within a stroke of securing the match; and both
Hone and R. V. Thomas beat Mclnnes. Meanwhile
Stuart: had defeated both Dive and Kalms; and
presently the three Adelaide men wore honored Lv
a preliminary inquiry whether they could go aw,tv
for the Davis Cup if chosen.
“15-30”: (!. M. Hone, the young S. Aus.
tennis player, who has a chance of representing
Australia in the Davis Cup team, is rapidly work-
ing his way up among the top-liners. great
game against Patterson in Adelaide was a revela-
tion to those who had seen him playing in Mel-
bourne some months before. He is a tall youth
who is developing a service that threatens to be as
powerful as Patterson’s, and, indeed, during his
match with the Vic. champion, he sent over some
balls that were quite untakable. Added to his
forceful serve, he has a variety of lively ground-
strokes that should win him points in the best com-
pany. On account of his height he ought to be
demoralising overhead. Likewise hie long legs
ought to carry him over the court quicker than
most. All ho wants now is practice and experience;
and a trip to America, if it can be managed, should
do him the world of good.
“Linesman”: Suzanne Lenglen must now
have satisfied all her Yankee detractors by beating
Mrs. Mallory at Nice in two love sets. Hardly in
the history of tennis lias such a hiding been admini-
stered to a lady—especially to one who was supposed
to be the French girl's most serious rival. But
Mrs. Mallory never carried enough guns for a tourna-
ment with a girl who derides all the traditions by
playing like a man. The Lenglen has discovered
that the secret of success is to get up to the net
and cut off the opponent’s heavily-paced returns m
mid-career. She volleys low and deep, and no other
woman has ever been guilty of that. Nor has any
petticoated rival developed her power overhead. She
is a world-beater, an oddity, and her like has never
been seen before. Mrs. Mallory made much of the
fact that she was leading against Suzanne in an
American match, when the latter retired. It was
alleged that the French miss was suffering from cold
feet, but the one-sided results of subsequent
encounters strongly corroborate the demoiselle’s con-
tention that she really was ill. Mrs. Mallory, any-
how, has been triumphantly effaced, and the only
one who now Seems capable of putting up a fight
with her victor is the modest little English damsel,
Miss McKane.
There was £2852 in the house when Sid
Godfrey (9st. 101 b.) met the American Eagel (9st.
1011 b.) at Svdney Stadium on Saturday, and the pugs
collected £713 apiece. They got their money easily.
Apart from a spasm of excitement in the second
round, when Godfrey sent the Yank to the floor with
a snappy right and then stumbled over the prostrate
bodv, it was an uninteresting argument, with the
Sydney man always in the lead. Eagel didn’t win a
round. However he stood in mid-ring when the
decision was given to Godfrey, with an expression
of dissatisfaction on his mobile mug.
It wasn’t until the last moment that 16-
vear-old Ella Smith decided to compete in the 440 yards
N.S.W. ehamnionship at Manly. Ella weighed in with a
post entry, “just to make a race of it,” she explained.
She surprised herself and evervone else by beating
Lilv Robertson and Enid Charlton by five and ten
vards respectively, in 6min. 45 2-ssec., which is only
6 3-ssecs. outside Mina Wylie’s time in the recent
Australian championship. Mina, by the way, has
been showing some of her old form in M.L. She
has had two great races at Auckland with Paula
Hoeft, dead-heating in one and losing the other by
a touch.
George Whatmore, owner of the Banana-
land yacht Miss Brisbane, which has proved itself
easily the fastest Australian boat in the 21ft.. re-
stricted class, is a native of North Sydney, and was
once in the N.S.W. Lands Department and the Syd-
ney Ferry Co. In those days he was known as a
crack cyclist, a fine ooen-boat sailer and a good
oarsman. He is over 50 now, and the more strenu-
ous pastimes know him no more. But he retains
the old liking for the milder aquatic snorts, and
the old ability to enliven a dull quarter-hour with
a rousing recitation.

A r arious records were broken when Arthur
Richardson and his South Australians hammered the
English bowling on the Adelaide Oval. Richard-
son’s 280 was the highest score ever made by a
Croweater against an English team, or against anv-
bodv in a single day. Also 160 of them were made
in boundary hits, which is believed to surpass any-
thing that even Lyons ever did. And, finally, even
the high-scoring Adelaide Oval has never before
seen 495 runs made in a day.

Bardsley was a name to conjure with in
the cricket world on Saturday. At Perth Warren
Bardslev hit up 112 v. West Australia, and in Sydney
his younger brother, a righthander, who plays for
Western Suburbs, smacked the Paddington bowlers
for 147. Westralia’s top-scorer was Tim Howard
(74), who played against Bardsley when the latter
and Macartney visited the West as colts about 18
years ago. In those days Ernie Parker, the Perth
batsman, was more brilliant than either, but Parker
gave up cricket for tennis. Then he was killed at
the war. Another century-maker on Saturday was
Alan Kippax, who knocked up a slashing 106 for
Waverley v. Mosman.

L. McBRIEN,

football secretary.
“Tren”: “Pongo” Tidd, of Oollingwood,
gave me the good oil. “Our boot factory ’ad a
snifter cricket team, but the push over the road in
Fitzroy never played, so we challenged ’em to a
game fer a dinner. We thort we was on a soda,
but in the finish we was flamin’'lucky ter get out
of it. To start with, our two best bats, ‘Bullets’
Barton and ‘Piggy’ Jones, turns up shickered —-and
out we all goes for 44. The other mob w'as goin’
dirt cheap too-—6 for 15 was the figures;—till a
religious cow, ’Oly Joe we calls ’im, started to ’it
like blazes. We was playin’ by the Yarra, where
the ground dips sudden at the bound’ry; and w hen
they wants eight to win and one w’icket to fall,
blast me if ’Oly Joe don’t ’it a Sixer inter this
’ollow. ‘Sugar’ Smith chases it right outer sight,
hut wc knew it couldn’t get inter the river because
of another rise. After a while ‘Sugar’ yells out he
can’t find it, so over we all goes and looks ; but
it was dinkum lost. Then there’s a big argument.
Evenshally we agrees it’s a drawn game. After
the other mob ’ad gone a while I ses ‘That ball
was theirs; let’s go and find it and we’ll stick to
it.’ ‘Yer’U ’ave ter get yer divin’ suit,’ sez ‘Sugar.’
‘I seen we was gone, so I chucked it inter the
Yarrer.’ ” “Yes,” agreed “Pongo,” “we was damn
lucky.”
# * * *
“Trekle”: There is no doubt about Wood-
full being a Test-match batsman, for never has a
successful player improved his style and rate of
scoring so rapidly. At the beginning of this season
he was gawky at the wickets, and had only two
or three scoring shots, but each innings since has
shown an improvement. Playing against Northcote
for South Melbourne, he went in first with Boy
Park, who is no plodder, and in the race for the
century actually won all the way, taking only S 9
minutes, while Park took 108. His total of 187
was made in 178 minutes and included 16 fourers.
But it was not his rate of scoring so much as his
freedom at the wicket and his new command of
strokes that impressed. After making 150 he gave
a hitting exhibition, going right down the wicket
to the pitch of the ball. He will certainly trouble
the English.
“Bail” : Len Braund, the English
cricketer who was out in Australia 15 years ago,
was up till lately prospering as the proprietor of
the Horse and Dolphin in St. Martin’s-street, London,
a hostelry much frequented by the sporting fraternity.
Melbourne recalls Braund as a handsome pro. whose
name was dragged into a locally celebrated divorce
case. The house in question was called “Novar,”
and, during a match on the M.C.C. ground, the “bob"
wits advised the English captain to “Give Braund a
Novar.” This jest was varied with the comment
that Braund was better at “footie” than at cricket,
“footie” being a pastime at smart dinner-parties
of the “Novar” description. But he took it all
smilingly and made everybody feel that he was
something of a sport. Other English professional
cricketers have found beer-pulling some compensation
for the pangs of obscurity. Richardson, the old
Surrey fast bow'ler, took many wickets with a famous
brew he dispensed at a popular Cockney resort, and
Brockwell was also in the business. How many
Australian chamnions, I wonder, have retired behind
a bar? The only one I know who has got nearest
to the trade is Armstrong, and he is only the repre-
sentative of a whisky firm.
“Haka”: Maclaren’s remarks about M.L.
cricketers not knowing the handle of a bat from the
blade set at least one humorist thinking. In the
match Nelson against Motueka, a Nelson batsman
arrived at the pitch with his bat fuily labelled as
to how to hold it and what to do with it. He
knocked up top score.
* * * *
“Winkle”: It seldom happens in first-class
cricket nowadays that the captain, the vice and
certain knowing old heads confer on the field when
a crisis occurs, but it was a common occurrence in
the long ago. Old George Giffen once put a joke
on the public by a conference of this kind. In a
match at Melbourne, he kept himself on so long that
the two opnosing batsmen knew his every wile, and
seemed likely to win the game off their own bats.
The crowd, meantime, clamored wildly for him to
give another bowler a chance. When, between overs,
Giff. and several others met, and, after a discus-
sion, the ball was thrown to Jack Lyons the crowd
yelled with delight. Jack walked to the bowler’s-
end, made the usual preliminary arrangements, and
threw 7 the ball back to Giffen, who resumed bowding.
This shrewd move pacified the public, but did not
break the partnership.

“Some women study form, no doubt; but if a
woman dreams she is getting- married in a purple

Wedding Day ridden by a jockey with a purple cap,

"The Woman Gambler.-’
The night before the race 1 dreamed
I’d wed a bouncing bride.

Hence, when “The Bond” I spied
(The jock in tartan, too ) I deemed
The tip was bonyflde.

5,285 INSPECTIONS PER CAR
The faithfulness of performance so universally remarked
in Dodge Brothers’ Motor Cars, is due, in no small part,
to the thoroughness with which each unit is inspected
during the process of manufacture and assembly.
A trained staff of 1100 experts is employed in this work
alone, and approximately 5285 inspections are made
on each car.
The deep satisfaction universally expressed by more
than 875,000 owners—many of them in Australia—is
due in a great measure to the rigid thoroughness of this
inspection program.
So exacting and rigid are the standards applied to these
inspections that the slightest variation, either in work-
manship or material, is sufficient cause for immediate
rejection.
And, before the car is delivered to the purchaser, it ia
given a thorough, final inspection and tuning up by the
Dodge Brothers dealer.

THE INKY WAY.
“P. 8.”: In defiance of all tradition the Arous
devoted a quarter of a column to recording the
official opening of the new Herald office. Old hands
turned to the date-line to make sure they were
reading the good old naper when they saw link, Mur-
doch and the rest starred by name. The sentiments of
habitual readers in general were very similar to
those of Mr. Pickwick when Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz
dared to nod to Mr. Serjeant Snubbin, his (Pica-
wick’s) counsel, and presume to say that it was a
fine morning.
“8.R.C.”: It is odd to read of Walter Shaw
Sparrow as the author of a war book (B. 8/3/ 23).
He is an invalid, and for many years has earned
a good living in preparing the for
sumptuous woiks on art subjects. His study of Frank
Brangwyn has become almost a classic; the judg-
ment is sure, and the easy rhythmical English has a
charm to the lover of fine writing. Sparrow, by the
way, is the husband of Ada Ferrar, now a popular
eXoonent of grande dame characters in London, but
worshipped in Australia 20 or more years ago
as Mercia in “The Sign of the Cross.”
“George Rich”: I’ve got a great pyramid of
sympathy for the struggling rag in the strangled
country town; but surely some of them could
do better than they do for their district corres-
pondents. In a Western State bush township, there
are a couple of “our own correspondents” to two
papers published in the nearest port. One corres-
pondent serves up the district’s tittle-tattle twice
weekly—about a column each issue—for 30s. a month.
Of course most of it is piffle; but 30s. a month
for two columns or so a week —about 3s. 9d. a
column! Can’t the A.J.A., somehow, take the tribe
under its wing?
“ “Jaclcy Roo” (Lond.): The yarns about North-
eliffe’s huge losses on the Times were only yarns. In
June, 1922, Northcliffe held 350,000 ordinary
shares out of a total of 600,000. The Walter inter-
ests owned 200,000. The sale of the Times Book
Club buildings in New Oxford-street netted
£lOO,OOO. That helped at a time when help may
have been needed. Later he paid cash for the
200,000 Walter shares at £1 a share, thus con-
trolling £550,000 of ordinary capital. When he
died his interest was sold to the present proprietors
(chieflv Astor, M.P.) for £1,350,000. Nett profit,
£750,000. The 200,000 Walter shares fetched 50s.
each—a clear profit, in a few months, of £300,000.
It sounds as if Northcliffe's head was screwed on
the right way almost to the end.
“Iford”: Owen Seaman’s topical verse in London
Punch lacks its arresting quality of 20 years back
—a quarter of a century between the shafts would
tell on any Pegasus—but it is still an invaluable
guide to the pronunciation of proper names. Sea-
man is always genially apostrophising some man of
the hour, and, like the clever verse-craftsinan he is,
nothing pleases him better than to get in his sub-
ject’s name at the end of a line. Thus one may
receive a hint, all across the world, that some name
which is always cropping up in the cables isn’t
pronounced as the unsophisticated might think. For
instance, I thought Dean Inge would rhyme with
“singe” till I read a poem by “0.5.” addressed to
pessimism in gaiters. Then it became clear that
the final “e” was a lazy one ; Seaman yokes up
“Inge” in poetical harness with “sing,” and he
must know. Most Australians make the “o” long
in Bonar Law. But Seaman rhymes the Prime
Minister with “upon her” and “honor.”
“D.F.”: Judge Barron Field (B. l/3/’23) is sure
to crop up in any discussion about the beginning
of verse in Australia. But his claim to be the first
“Austral harmonist” on the strength of writing
verse about kangaroos in the twenties of last
century will not hold water. Michael Massey Rob-
inson, who was transported to Sydney in 1798, nad
been writing verse there for 20 years before Field
tried his hand. The very crime for which Robin-
son was lagged had a poetical flovor. He tried to
blackmail one Oldham, a London ironmonger, oy
threatening to publish verses charging Oldham with
having murdered his employer 20 years before. In
N. S. Wales Robinson became in time a kind of
unofficial poet-laureate, and used to write loyal odes
on the King’s birthday and similar occasions. His
verses were pretty rotten, but no worse than Field s.
Of course, if George Barrington had really written
the famous lines attributed to him about “leaving
our country for our country's good,” he would
be years ahead of either.
“A.E.M.”: Mary Colborne-Veel, who died at Christ-
church (M.L.) the other day, was, a poet and a woman
with a Stevensonian courage in her gentle soul.
She was among the best known of Maoriland s
women verse-writers. The Alexander-Currie collec-
tion of her country’s verse contains seven of her
poems, and Bertram Stevens chose four for his Aus-
tralian anthology. She had a gift for sweet and
graceful verse touched by true sentiment and for
devotional poetry. Her father was an Oxford man
who came to Canterbury in the early days and edited
the Press, and from him and her mother, who
wrote poetry on the invalid’s bed to which she was
confined for So long, she derived an appreciation
of literature that was assiduously cultivated all
through a life of sacrifice. Also she must have
owed something to the literary atmosphere of Can-
terbury. It is easy to make fun of the ecclesiastical-
social tone and ambition of that settlement, but
the Pilgrims had admirable qualities, and one of
them was a love of letters. Canterbury has had
a literary stamp such as marks no other part of
the country. The list of women writers produced
by or associated with it is impressive—Jessie
Mackay, Edith Searle Grossmann, Dora Wilcox, B.
E. Baughan, Dolce Cabot. G. B. Lancaster. Ail
were friends of Mary Colborne-Veel’s. Her father
died long ago and her mother was nursed through
many years of bed-ridden invalidism by Mary ano
her ‘delicate sister. In the circumstances there
was not much time for literary work, yet Man
wrote regularly and w-ell for the Press. She found
time, too, for work in the interests of women and
general social welfare. The trials and disappoint
ments of her life she bore with a serene courage
that never failed her.
Bob Dexter tells how it’s done: Two-and-a-hali
years' story-writing in U.S.A. helps me to
laugh at Gertrude Lewis’s lament (B. 16/11/ 2-)
that America doesn’t want Australian writers; that
big people won’t look at their stuff and only
an occasional small agent will handle it. A
few facts may hearten the inky Aussie. To-day
I received a request from Doubleday Page for four
Australian stories for magazine publication and
newspaper syndication. Last week the Red Book
and the Blue Book asked for stuff. Everybody e,
the Metropolitan and Asia have made similar re-
quests in the past couple of months. These are
all A-grade magazines, paying top prices and in-
sisting that my contributions be Australian. In
fact, every first-class general fiction publication
except the" Cosmopolitan is in the market for any-
one who can write to its standard. The sign on
the Cosmopolitan’s door reads “Celebrities Only,
and one Australian, James Francis Dwyer, goes
smiling through. One of these days I hope to do
it mvself. As to agents, Mrs. Julia Tutwiler, who
induces the editors to pay about twice as much as
rav tales are worth, performs the same service for
Frances Hodgson Burnett, Alice Duer Miller, Fred-
erick O’Brien, Daniel Wilbur Steele, etc. Now. about
the wav in. It is sloppy sometimes, but, provided
vou can tell an f.a.q. story, it is as well regulated
as the progress of a first-year cadet to general re-
porter under the A.J.A. award. You start with lurid
action or sex-rampant magazines at one cent per
word or less; move into Adventure on one hand
or Snappy Stories on the other, at from or.e-and-a-
half cents to three cents per word. Then, if you’re
as foolish as I was, you’re tempted with a contract
for a billion words a year; vou sweat blood; get
vour name on the cover and yourself chained to
Loose-Lizzie heroines until their undulations are
loathsome and every corseted lay-figure in the
dressmakers’ windows seems a personal insult. The
alternative route —a direct bombardment of A-grade
magazines—would put even a genius on quarter-
rations. Experience gained among the minors >s
valuable, too, in that it helps a writer to change
from the crisp style of The Bulletin 2000-worder
to the more languid, littered rhetoric necessary for
American consumption.

“French Leave,” the new play at Sydney
Criterion, is a brisk little war comedy, and
is none the less interesting because it was
written by Reginald Cheyne Berkeley, whom
Maoriland claims as its own. Though Lon-
don-born, Berkeley was grounded in Latin
and Greek at Auckland College, and is a
member of the Auckland Bar. He wrote the
thing as a relief from the tedium of the first
Somme campaign, and it was successfully
produced at London Globe in July, 1920.
But the part of a dashing young war-wife,
who gets admission to the brigade messroom
in the character of a gay French lady, hardly
suits Emelie Polini’s full-blown charms and
tempestuous style. Miss Polini couldn’t act
badly if she tried, hut she has beeu more
happily cast in other productions. She is at
her best in a flirtatious scene with Leslie
Holland, who is uncommonly entertaining
as a sportive old brass-hat —-a character
very reminiscent of Kipling’s Lieutenant-
General Bangs. Capital help is given by
Frank Harvey, as the lady’s jealous husband,
and by Anew McMaster, as an impassioned
lieutenant; and the minor parts are well
played by Eily Malyon, Raymond Lawrence,
John Fernside and Edwin Brett. “Madame
Butterfly,” rather sombre stuff after the
bright fun of "French Leave,” completes the
hill. Here again Miss Polini has failed to
find her ideal part, but her Clio-Cho-San is
a conscientious piece of work, and she is
assisted by some clever people, notably Katie
Towers and Gerald Kay Souper, and by the
scene-painter and the orchestra.

That corner of Sydney which is the Town
Hall was transformed into Ireland pro tern.
on Saturday night when "xiie Irish Village”
sprang into view and the Ireland of song and
sentiment into hearing. The Erin Isle enter-
tainers give a capital programme in an
excellent setting. Their Ireland is not the
rather melancholy one of “The Irish Players,”
but a land of color and romance and melody,
with Kerry dances and colleens and Dublin
jarveys and jaunting cars and Castle Blar-
neys and Killarney Lakes. “The Harp that
Once” has its strings swept bravely, the
Irish pipes make pleasant music and “the
horn of the hunter is heard on the hill.” Mr.
Charles O’Mara shows himself a fine robust
singer and a spirited raconteur, Miss Bettie
and Miss Billie Byrne are a tuneful and
merrily-tripping pair, the veteran piper, Mr.
Tom Buckley, scores full measure, and Kee-
gan and Malone are all-round performers of
merit

Royal Mark Sabre
continues to

“Sally” still foots it to tinkling melody
and glitter and glad acclaim at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney. The piece is a stayer,
and Josie Melville the goods.
At the Grand Opera House, next Satur-
day, Bailey and Grant will present Steele
Rudd’s “On Our Selection,” a certified
winner in the stageland domain of rich
humor. Bert Bailey will, of course, be the
whiskered ancient.
This week at Sydney Tivoli La Ventura
poses on a pedestal against a white screen
and so becomes part and parcel of gorgeous
Oriental, tropical and floral scenes projected
by lantern slides. Some of the effects are
striking. Gus McNaughton and Jesse Sweet
still fetch giggles with their burlesque, and
Terpsichore whirls to captivated houses.
The eight Arabs continue to give a fine show
of acrobatics, and Eric Godley’s robust melo-
dies deserve a mention, along with Maggie
Foster’s fiddling.

Sydney’s big movie-thriller this week is
“Monte Cristo,” at the Piccadilly, a well-
produced adaptation of the old classic. John
Gilbert, with great versatility, plays the
youthful sailor, the half-demented prisoner
of the Chateau d’lf and the Count. He
grips you from start to fade-out. The
Lyceum presents Wesley Barry in “Rags to
Riches,” and “Tansy,” a romance of old
Sussex, featuring Alma Taylor. The Lyric has
“Rags to Riches” and “Garrison’s Finish,”
with Jack Bickford as the jockey who pro-
vides the finish aforesaid. "The Pride of
Palomar” cries at the Strand and Haymarket
for a White California policy; and at the
Strand support is lent by “Ten Nights in a
Bar-room.” Hoyt’s has “Another Man’s
Shoes,” rather exciting, as the other man
is doomed by a European secret society,
and “A Californian Romance,” an old West-
ern U.S. story. “Tess of the Storm Coun-
try” is in its third week at the Crystal
GREGAN McMAHON as he appeared in
the guise of J. M. Barrie's Lob at the
Conservatorium last week.
Palace, and the Globe still presents that
lengthy lecture “Manslaughter.”
Wirths’ Circus canters and leaps and flies
and gyrates in the air and cleaves the water
at the Hippodrome with easy grace and un-
abated adroitness.

High praise for a Sydney show: —
A. E. Newbury has had at Horderns’ Galleries
the best one-man show Sydney has seen for a long
while. Most of the pictures, are small, but it is
doubtful whether any other Australian has carried
landscape painting further than he has done in
a half-dozen of them. Notable among this group are
“A Bright Morning,” “Dead Wattles on the River
Bank,” “Silvery Light,” “Grey Light of Morning,”
and the “Billabong” ; these, like the larger pictures,
“The Young Wife,” “Early Summer” and “Hills from
Yarra Glen,” would grace any private collection.
The balance of the work is solid and free of the
sensationalism in color and design and exhibition
of brush-stroke facility common enough and nause-
ating enough in contemporary art.
The self-sacrifice of an illegitimate mamma
brokenly parting with a cherished offspring
for the good of its soul is celebrated with
flourish of damp hankies in “Woman to
Woman” at Melbourne Royal. From the
start the author sentimentalises over the
position of the French dancer Delory se, em-
phasising- her devotion as the crowning won-
der of her womanhood, apparently previously
glorified by her reckless passion. The sub-
sequent argument between Delory se, her
seducer and the latter’s wife bristles with
stagey conventionalisms and false points of
honor, but the audience accepts the exhibi-
tion of female caprice regarding the custody
of the “eheild” as emotionally necessary to
a theme wherein Lothario must be shown
as a brute hounded by a Baptist conscience,
while the willing partner of his folly is pro-
vided with a handsome exit, reappearing
years after as a silver-wigged angel, with
birds twittering and the sun setting on a
tableau of perfect peace. This final scene
is superfluous epilogue to a drama which is
trumpery in its pretence of discussing a
serious problem. The play is also pertly
feminine in its climaxes, as witness
Deloryse’s devastating performance at the
end of the second act. when she charges her
outraged rival with being a childless wife.
1 ielorvse is engagingly acted by Gertrude
Elliott, who, however, superimposes her gen-
tility on the saccharine type, with the result
that we get ineffable displays of high breed-
ing and Tittle of the petit bourgeois outlook
whereof the dancer pretends to be so proud.
The actress keeps close to her work all
through, running the whole gamut from
raillery to blank despair; but this writer will
want to see her in vehicles furnishing greater
tests for her talents before conceding that
her appearance here is an event, Cronin
Wilson practically declares that sinful hus-
bands, in trying to maintain the balance of
power between wife and mistress, must stra-
tegically retreat into crestfallen taciturnity
and assert themselves as little as possible.
Probably it will take Melbourne some time
to get used to Cronin Wilson’s style, which
seems very like ponderousness with suave
drawing-room finish. Lilias Waldegrave, as
the wife, switches from shudders of insulted
respectability to surprising breadth of vision
as a woman of the world, without being
dizzied by change of mood. She is a pretty
fair actress, though obliterated by the lead-
ing lady. Phyllis Moyle, as child David,
tootles in the painfully punctilious fashion
of a well-rehearsed kid ; and J. B. Rowe, as
grown-up David, has an undistinguished con-
versation with his heavenly mother in the
last act. Anne McEwen, Gertrude Boswell
and T. M. Oliff give no offence as superior
domestics, and Aubrey Mathers’s soothing
tones as a beautiful bedside doctor are like
a distant peal of bells to an overwrought ear.
* * * *
To the present commentator it seems years
since “The O’Brien Girl” started her bright
career at Melbourne Princess’s. If the
show runs on for another couple of months
this theatre will have to be turned over to
“The Oldest Inhabitant.”
* * * *
Nothing disturbs the serenity of pirate
Applejack at Melbourne King’s. The aplomb
with which he massacres the Chinese bos’n,
while his mutinous crew is threatening to
rend him limb from limb, was probably never
equalled in the lustiest days of Kidd and
Morgan.
* * * *
The English Gussie, with the eyeglass and
the kodak, continues to be a bright spot in
“A Southern Maid,” now given a wider
range of action on the roomier stage of Mel-
bourne Majesty’s.
A horde of workmen has been toiling
round the clock to get the Melbourne Palace
renovated and refurnished for the first Aus-
tralian production of “Bulldog Drummond.”
At time of writing the theatre is a maze
of scaffolding, but Hugh Ward gives his
solemn word that everything will be ready
for a spectacular premiere next Saturday.
The Mermaid Play Society will break its
long silence at the Melba Hall, Parkville,
nex;t Thursday night with productions of
Milne’s “Stepmother” and Harold Chapin’s
“Art and Opportunity.”
Another forthcoming attraction is the re-
appearance of Evelyn Scotney at Melbourne
Town Hall on April 7. The advt. states that
she has now a “voice of fascinating floridity,”
and there has been a rush on the dictionary
to find out what the new development means.
The Cycling Brunettes are now whirling
at Melbourne Tivoli, while Bert Maddison,
the burlesque comedian, nas done nothing
to earn a vote of censure so far. Will J.
(Paddy) Saunders, the chalk-talker, con-
tinues to hold his place more by talk than
chalk, and the sometimes-musical Vagabonds
lighten the depression produced by the flock
of educated pigeons. Melbourne will doubt-
less strive to keep a small corner in its recol-
lection for the Southern Singers, who are on
the point of departure after yodelling various
ditties in the true water-melon manner.
“One Week of Love,” at Hoyt’s, Melbourne,
is nothing to write to the Anglican Mes-
senger about. It is the faded tale of the
lion who is turned to a lamb by Elaine Ham-
merstein’s thrilling beauty. The writer
takes off his hat to the plot of “The Pride
of Palomar,” which follows ou. Great age
demands some mark of respect. The best
film in sight is the Mack Sennett subject,
“The Cross Roads of New York,” at the
Majestic. Some conventional scenes are
twisted and woven into a fable of diverting
humor and originality. “The Man Who Had
Everything,” on the same screen, is one of
those rich pups who make the world unsafe
for plutocracy. In “Come On Over,” at
the Britannia, you will see a bhoy who is
nfther the heart of every thrue colleen. Tom
Mix, by the way, is now revolutioneering.
Full particulars of the casualties are posted
up at the Melba.

An early autumn show in Melbourne :
Conspicuous in the first autumn show of the
Decoration Gallery are several English water-colors
bv Harold Herbert. The pictures reveal that the
Ballarat artist has developed in restraint since fce
left Australia. The low-pitched “Rain and Mist,
Dorking,” is almost a manifesto of a new outlook
on nature brought about by contact with wintry
English scenery. Throughout his work has a gracious
suavity-, except in the case of “Piccadilly Circus,”
which is painted in a lively, spontaneous manner.
A drawing of the same scene in pencil is proof of
is the author of six delightful impressions, of which
“Windswept” is a clever appreciation of a tender
time of day. “Still Eve” is another example of
“If Winter Comes,”
at Sydney Royal.

Lindsay is most pro-

drawn study of Span-
ish beggars, but nis
“Hulks, Berry Bay,”

and hard qualities of

handsomely revived by
Napier Waller, whose
view of two archers
entitled “Hit” is about
the best seen here for
years. Lloyd Bees has
a fair pen-and-ink
sketch of Parliament
House, Brisbane; and
Christian Yand e 11
asserts her decorative
soul in two or three
drawings of Irish leg-
ends. Beside all these
more or less poetic per-
formers, Norman Lloyd
.seems almost a demon-
strative realist with
his sunny little corner of Sydney Harbor.
>!? Jji if.
And another :—•
-'I. W. O’Connell’s art, as diagnosed in his latest
show at Melbourne Athenaeum, is still full of whims
and influences, but he has dropped a lot of his
earlier extravagance. He remains conspicuously
an admirer of the Japanese mode of reducing a
landscape to faint decorative details. “Near Port
Campbell” and “Landscape with a Boat” are two
curious examples of this manner. He gets nearer
to realism in some other studies of Australian land-
scapes, but if he cannot find a tree eccentric enough
for his purpose he doesn’t mind inventing one. lie
loves to depict ti-tl’ee writhing against a chink
of yellow afternoon, and he paints the foliage in
dark and menaneing masses to accentuate the im-
pression of terror and foreboding. This is striking
and often charming, but it is difficult to reconcile
the creator of these efforts with the prancing and
gladsome hedonist who is responsible for the first
four subjects of the catalogue. Here we have the
life that lives desultorily on a fan—everything and
everybody posed and planned in a delicate and tender
design. The artist misses once in presenting a
matronly figure in the centre of “The Bathers,” for
the dame is almost as incongruous as an elephant
among fairies. Summed up, O’Connell hasn’t lost
any of his promise, but he needs to improve his
drawing.
The value of one strong personality to a
show is being well illustrated in Adelaide,
Fred Bluett stands out at the Majestic as
Claude Dampier does at the Dandies, though
there is a good supporting bill in each case.
The Serenaders now have the open air to
themselves for what remains of summer, and
have wisely got Madeline liossiter in, she
being another artist with a personality.
Allan Wilkie has had a great season at the
Prince of Wales’s, students of various kinds
attending en masse as an educational duty.
He gave Adelaide what is probably its first
sight of “King John,” taking the King him-
self and leaving Faulconbridge to Leslie
Manners. Miss Hunter-Watts got her chance
as Constance, and rose to it. A scholarly
hut merry rendering of “The Tempest” is
finishing the season. •
Brisbane is going to have a busy theatri-
cal Easter. It is dusting its dinner-jacket
to sit in the stalls at His Majesty’s on Easter
Saturday, and smile at Maude Fane in “A
Night Out.” Rawdon Blandford has opened
the Bohemia Theatre in his “Classics of
1923,” which include Clarice Buckman, who
has picked up a hint or two about singing
from sister Rosina, and Elton Black. The
stock company at the Theatre Royal, headed
by little Yvonne Banvard, will probably give
something less mournful than “Outcast.”
which has been on the bill this week. The
Humphrey Bishop Company, the skeleton of
the merry party that played “Cinderella” in
Sydney at Christmas-time, is still at Cre-
morne, while Toowoombaite Eugenie Boland
is warbling in her most luscious contralto at
the head of the bill at the Empire. V ith
the help of a picture or two, Brisbane
can go to a new show every night for a
week.

The Grain and Fertilizer Drill with Spring Tynes.
Cuts out all the soil to the desired depth of sowing. Destroys
all the weeds. Plants the seed on a flat, compacted surface
and covers every grain with a blanket of pulverised soil. This
conserves the rising moisture for the benefit of the seed, hastens
germination, and causes vigorous growth and increased
yields. No progressive farmer can afford to ignore this system.
Catalogues and quotations sent promptly on request.
Made with 17, 25, 29, 33 or 41 Fynes, sowing respectively
8, 12, 14, 16or 20 rows. Rows spaced 7 inches apart. Tynes
are in four ranks, and have 4-inch points. Rigid Tynes
supplied for well-cleared land, in lieu of Spring Tynes. Sows
seed and fertilizer in any desired quantities. Combines two
implements in one, as it may be used as a cultivator only.
Will sow oats on stubble land in one single operation and give
good results.

“J.F.IL” (London) : Florence Fawaz Aus-
tral has captured the London musical critics,
who acclaim her as the coming Melba.
She has actually arrived in that capacity,
according to some of them. The Times
man, referring to her performance in
“Siegfried,” says that “the volume and
purity of her tone thrilled the Covent
Garden audience as nothing else did
during the evening.” The Telegraph de-
clares, in the same connection, that her sing-
ing, “with its great spirit and beauty, was
the best heard in Covent Garden for a long
time past. Equally enthusiastic is the
Morning Post, which refers pointedly to
the fact that there is now no theatre in
Australia producing high-class opera, nor
any manager able and willing to develop
local talent in that direction. As a result: —
The only road to fame and fortune for gifted
young Australians lies on the water that separates
them from England and America. And to traverse
that road needs money and influence, which only a
comparatively few of them can command. So the
failure of Australian voices to reach their own public
makes the whole world of song the poorer.
A true bill. Most Australians are, or pro-
fess to be, Protectionists, but there is preci-
ous little of Protection to native industry in
their attitude to the theatre and amusements
of every description. They are unabashed
Freetraders in that respect.
“Wilfrido”: Regarding Bennison (B.
15/3/’23), “Benvenuto” was produced in
M.L. under the name of “The Lady of My
Dreams.” It received only a lukewarm
hearing, owing chiefly to the poor acting of
Marjorie Bennett as Felicia Alori (she played
the part exactly as she played the servmg-
maid in “Johnny Get Your Gun”) and to
Bennison having made his medieval hero a
cross between Jack Point and Rupert of
Hentzau At one performance in Christ-
church the candles in the third act tumbled
off their accustomed shelf just as Benvenuto
killed the traitorous hireling of Count
Strozzi for the sake of his bronze breastplate.
As the deceased soldier lay in the semi-
darkness he received the boot of the incoming
Cosimo de Medici in the neck. The aston-
ished Duke of Florence was not the only one
to hear the remark “Look where you’re
going, you clumsy cow!” But the reply, if
any, was lost in the intervening centuries.
“Nella”: “The Mug” (B. 22/3/’23) attri-
butes Louis Bennison’s non-success, not, as
I maintained, to the bad judgment.of the man-
agement which started him here in Johnny
Get Your Gun” instead of the superior The
Great Lover,” but to the want of a leading
lady clever enough to do him justice. _ Law-
rence Grossmith has made an emphatic suc-
cess here with Ins two plays, and he began
with the same two ladies in the lead as Ben-
nison did—Diana Wilson and Doris Kendal.
Also Lizette Parkes, who helped Bennison
over’the stile in the egregious “Benvenuto,’
is quite as good a player as he. As to citing
J. C. Williamson as the exemplar of judicious
management, does “The Mug” know that a
really wise management, Harwood, Stewart,
Hennings and Coppin, had hard work to re-
strain J.C.W. from putting on “The Fairy
Circle” instead of “Struck Oil” for his Aus-
tralian premiere? Go to! The plays the
thing, all the time.
“Norbell”: More power to Reg Long (B.
22/3/’23), who showed such grit at the T.R.,
Brisbane, and carried on with his hand in
a sling. Nellie Stewart, playing principal
boy in “Jack and the Beanstalk” in Sydney
years agone, fell off the magic vegetable and
broke her arm. They set the fractured limb
for her at the wings, and she carried on with
her arm in a sling for the rest of the per-
formance. I’ve seen a mummer —Frank
Hawthorne —shot in the eye, and finish his
bit, although enduring agony. On the other
hand, I was playing with Victor Dartnell
when he jambed his thumb between two
wings, and it needed the full strength of the
company to keep him going. Yet, later on, in
a Bigger Engagement, he cheerfully gave his
life for his mates, and died in wanning his
Y.C. —the first actor to gain it.
“Bello”: Touching “J.F.II.’s” reminis-
cences of “Maritana” (B. 15/3/’23). Anme
Mulligan, a niece of Vincent Wallace, stated
not long ago that the composer wrote “Mari-
tana” in “Rowe-street, Sydney, nearly oppo-
site to where the Hotel Australia shops are
now-’.” “Alas, Those Chimes,” it was said,
was inspired by the ringing of St. Mary’s
Cathedral bells one Sunday evening, “causing
my uncle to compose it in the early hours
of the next morning. At that time Wal-
lace was connected with the Cathedral choir.”
Madame Guerin, the first Australian Mari-
tana, was a gifted actress. She sang in the
sanctuary choir at St. Mary’s; so did
Madame Wallace-Bushell, the composer’s
sister.
“Nero”: The Esther Mitchell —“a little
chorus girl”—who has been figuring in the
papers lately in connection with a lurid
Sydney divorce case, is not the clever little
lady who was a member of various Tait and
J.C.W. - cos., and whose performances as
EMBARRASSMENT.
SHE: “Didn't you feel pretty cheap sitting there with a young innocent girl at such a
shocking play?”
HE: “I assure you I did. She had to explain a good many of the innuendoes before I was
able to see them”
the Chinese girl in “Mr. Wu” and the dainty
flapper in “The Luck qf the Navy” will be
remembered with pleasure by many theatre-
goers. That Esther Mitchell left for New
York in 1921 and is still in that city, mak-
ing a good name for herself.
“Dic-kus”: Harry Benham (B. 8/2/’23),
after retiring from the footlights about 35
years ago, was a well-known figure in Bris-
bane for many years—he described himself
then as “Pat Mo” Barrington, bookmaker.
There he very successfully produced “Cloches
de Corneville” and “Pirates of Penzance.”
Signor Truda, since returned to Italy to die,
was musical conductor. “Mo” produced,
stage-managed and appeared in the produc-
tion, his wife arranging dresses and dances.
Incidentally, his true name was Morris Ben-
jamin ; he was an uncle of pianist-composer
Arthur Benjamin, one of Australia’s best
present-day young musicians.
“Wilfrido”: There is one old
whom ’cellist Jean Gerardy will miss if he
strikes New Plymouth (M.L.) in his com-
ing tour. That is a blacksmith, now sorrow-
ing or rejoicing elsewhere, whose workshop
used to be situated on the outskirts of the
town. Every morning the darlc-ha’red
genius would be seen leaning over a raifirg
at the opening of the shop, fervently drink-
ing in the noise of the flames bellowing in
the forge and the sledge beating on the anvil.
This curious attraction would hold him some-
times for over an hour, and an uncom-
municative friendship sprang up between
him and the smith, who was more used to
children coming home from school than to
melancholy musicians.
“Thor”: Have Australian theatre man-
agements a school tor training the "loilay’
youths to proclaim their wares? Ail of tnem
synchronise in hideous nasal inflection and
mispronunciation, which makes one darkly
suspect that they are the source from winch
some of our native actors derive. Why go
about the theatres shoutmg the woid, any-
way? The man who is go.ng to buy h s girl
chocs will be on the lookout, all right, and if
she happens to be his spouse she’ll do all
the looking out that’s required. Only in
Australian theatres is the chocolate menial
permitted to become a vocal nuisance, except
in the galleries of the lower-class melodrama
and twiee-or-thr.ce-n ghtly vaudeville houses
in Brit'sh and Continental cities.
“Flicker”: I am against “Lex” (B.
15 /3/’23) and for the authors of “The
Flaw.” In sp.te of Lord Coleridge’s rem irks
concerning “acts in themselves dangerous,”
the worsh.p of Property is too strongly fixed
in the English mind to allow any penalty
to be inflicted on a man who kills a burglar
in the act. In 1811 one Purcell, a septua-
genarian, was knighted for k.ll ng four burg-
lars with a carving-knife. And he wasn’t
even tried for his achievement. According
to Kenny, the great authority on criminal
law, “interference with property does not
justify the taking of the trespasser’s life
except the interference amounts to some
felony such as robbery, arson or burglary.”
“L.11.P.”: “C. Ockney” asserts (B.
22/3/’23) that Edwin Booth was “vilely
supported by a hastily-gathered troupe
of English players” when lie made
his second London appearance as Hamlet at
the new Princess’s on Nov. 6, 1880. Not
so. The support included Tom Swmbourne
as the King, Mrs. Herman Vezin (otherwise
Mrs. Charles Young, who had gained a big
reputation in Australia) as the Queen, Wil-
liam Farren as Polonius, John Ryder as the
Ghost, Edmund Leathes as Laeretes, John
Beauchamp (Gurnemanz in the 1907 Austra-
lian production of “Parsifal”) as Horatio,
and delightful Maud Milton as the Player
Queen. I grant Miss Gerard, the Ophelia
of the production, was not up to the mark;
but the others mentioned were all sound and
experienced exponents of Shakspeare. Ryder
had been one of Charles Kean’s principals.
When Booth played “The Fool’s Revenge”
the cast included Charles Cartwright as
Serafino. “The Fool’s Revenge” was the
finest thing Booth did in London. Why
Henry Irving never tried it is a mystery:
it \v*u Id have suited his style admirably.
“Up Stage”: Tom Walls, who gave such
a faithful imitation of Alf Lester as Peter
Doody in the Australian production of “The
Arcadians,” is a horse-trainer as well as a
play-actor at Daly’s, London. Somehow, this
theatre has been particularly associated with
the racing game since the late George
Edwardes took it over. George’s brother,
Colonel Edwardes, trained several winners
for him, Santoi being the most noteworthy.
G. P. Huntley had a string of horses when
he worked at Daly’s. And now there is Leslie
Henson, who owns Tons of Money, a mem-
ber of Walls’s string, which didn’t fulfil the
bright promise of its name in the Lincoln-
shire. Henson and Walls, by the way, are
partners in a prosperous syndicate that runs
several touring companies.
“Blackfriars”: I stand partly corrected
by “D.8.E.” (B. l/3/’23). Wolf-I erran s
“Secret of Suzanne” was perfoimed in Aus-
tralia during Genee’s tour. But the setting
was not the right one to give it a chance.
The public that went to observe Adeline s
dainty pirouetting was a different kind from
the grand-opera crowd, and it lost sight ot
the high merit of Wolf-I errari s music in
looking for a bit more plot than the trivial
smok.ng of a lady cigarettist. Genee s man-
agement would have been as completely jus-
tified in putting on Mozart s Marrnyje of
Figaro” to fill out her programme. Give
Suzanne and her secret their right psycho-
logical setting, and the little opera is a
certain winner.
“T.W.”: Nothing about hands-layer Hick-
son has interested me so much as the careful
way in which plans were laid for the boom.
Instead of butting into Melbourne or Syd-
ney for a start, as ordinary pnma donnas,
evangelists and Oscar Asches do, Hickson
played the smalls first, beginning operations
m Tassy and then transferring to Ballarat,
so that the rumors of many healings in
those places might be properly circulated ere
he tackled the chief centres. Hickson’s pro-
cedure in S’Africa was the same, but when
he got to Capetown and the other big cities
a willy-willy of criticism gathered round
him on the score that his most sensational
cures seemed to have happened in remote
places to mostlv uttdiscoverable niggers.
“Adelaide”: Finkoistein, who has been
managing director of the Wondergraph Pic-
ture Co. in Adelaide since its foundation, has
resigned, though retaining a seat on the
Board. He is going to devote himself to
working up the dancing Palais on North-
terrace, founded several years ago by Eslick.
“Orb”: When the Alfred Dumpier co. was
leaving Sydney by boat for Victoria to open
in “Monte Cristo” an important prop was
left behind at Her Majesty’s. This was
the cannon-ball which is tied round the
ankles of the supposed Abbe Faria before he
is pitched into the Mediterranean. At the
last minute the property man sent it down
to the boat packed in a neat little box, and
addressed to “Alfred Dampier, Esq.” The
old man was a bit of a wag, and lie -landed
the box to the nice young man of the show,
Cecil Owen, telling him that it was a very
valuable present he had just received, and
adjuring him not to let it out of his sight.
Cecil staggered off with it—it weighed about
half-a-hundredweight—and faithfully guarded
it in his cabin till we got to Melbourne. At
the wharf he excited the suspicions of the
Customs officals, so we put them on to the
joke. Cecil was solemnly escorted to the
Customs shed, and his parcel examined. The
cannon-ball was confiscated, and Cecil threat-
ened with a £5O fine for illegally importing
an engine of w r ar. Of course we got the
prop back afterwards, but Cecil nearly wept
when he reported his loss. The old man
Admonished him in his best Shakspearean
hianner, “Untrue to your trust,_ ungracious
boy? I weep for thee, for this revolt of
thine is like another fall of man!”
“G.A.C.”: lan Maclaren (B. 15/3/’23)
had a very bad fault. Maoriland did not see
him in Shakspeare, but he was there as
juvenile lead with Marie Tempest, then in
a piiriing part with Margaret Wycherley in
“The Thirteenth Chair” and with O’Hara in
“Lightnin’.” Every time he let his audience
see that the parts were not good enough for
a man who could tackle the melancholy Dane.
You could imagine him going off to bail up
any stagehand who would listen,, and rail
against a fate that forced him into melo-
drama for a living. Better men than Mac-
laren have had to play worse parts. But an
audience doesn’t like to see a perfunctory
actor. D’Alvarez avas the same; that was
why she was not a success across the Tasman.
“Orb”: You meet ex-mummers in all sorts
of unexpected places. One well-known com-
edian is verger in a Sydney church ; another
is making lemonade in a cordial factory.
Two matinde pets have pubs in Sydney, and
one is a morning milk-o. Nellie Stewart
tells me that she patronised a fruit-barrow in
the street the other day to buy a pound of
grapes. The stentorian barrowman looked
at her keenly. “Blime,” he cordially ex-
claimed, “I know you. You were my sweet-
heart in ‘Cinderella’ over 20 years avo!” He
gallantly extended the usual professional
courtesy, and insisted on Sweet Nell haying
her bag of grapes as a “complimentary.”
“F.A.: An off-stage view of the Big
Smoke’s vaudeville stars may be had any
day at the Cavour, in Leicester-square. The
menu is of the full-and-plenty variety, and
is served without embellishments at 3s. a
cover. On my last visit I sat next George
Robey, who discussed vegetable culture with
Marie Lloyd and her sister. Violet Lor-
aine, Tich, Leslie Henson and Daphne
Pollard were in the immediate vicinity, also
discussing lettuce-growing and the like. It
would be quite safe to say that fully 80 per
cent, of those present were mummers, yet
an atmosphere of almost homely respecta-
bility pervaded the place.
THE RECITAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
White supple fingers brush the ivory keys
Caressingly as Cupid’s velvet kiss
On carmine lips in ecstasy of bliss,
And beautiful as breath of summer seas.
A delicate, fair Song of Spring the theme;
In dappled glades a flower-decked elfin throng
Revel and dance fantastically along
Through opal mazes of a golden dream.
A Barcarole, to rhythmic plash of oars ;
A serenade floats on the balmy air
To some divinity of dusky hair
And melting. glances which his soul adores.
“The Storm”—the rain descends, the wild wind
blows,
From rushing harmonies to poignant grief;
Low threnodies of Autumn, for the leaf
That falls, and ruined beauty of the rose.
The “Berceuse” —rhapsodies that pale and glow
Like pencilled flushes on the skies at eve;
Soft rainbow melodies that mothers weave
To tunes of zephyrs, with the music low.
A Nocturne —dreamy as the holy night
When the moon pours libations of sweet dew;
And lutes invisible, ’neath etheric blue,
Spill chords as rich as gleaming chrysolite.
Elusive is the Fugue as Echo’s trill
At morn, now near, now rosy-fingered, far
On azure wings to reach a splendid star....
And slim white hands, and ivory keys are still.
QUEENSLAND.

Hi
This TUDOR Battery IS NOT of the House- or Farm-lighting type. It is the largest
battery in the Commonwealth, has a capacity of 9000 ampere hours when discharged
in three hours, and forms part of the Plant of the Sydney Municipal Council Electricity
Department.
TUDOR Batteries for HOUSE- and FARM-LIGHTING SETS embody the same
principles of design and manufacture as are applied to our largest Power Batteries.
They are built to give a maximum life at a minimum expenditure for maintenance.
The result is a HOUSE-LIGHTING BATTERY that is unequalled for long service
and reliability.
If your present battery is not giving you satisfaction, install a TUDOR and thereby
protect yourself against further Battery troubles.
When purchasing a House-lighting Set, insist on a TUDOR Battery equipment; they
last longer and keep you free from worry. Over fifty municipalities and towns in
Australia have installed TUDOR BATTERIES in their Lighting Stations.
TUDOR BATTERIES ARE MADE IN ENGLAND .

DEAR DRUDGERY
A wise man doesn’t wait for the rain—not in this country. He
invests in a Billabong and a storage tank. During the recent dry months
many country people were forced to draw water from the creeks with
the aid of a sledge and cask or carry it in buckets. The time and forage
spent this way would have almost bought a Billabong water supply—
a supply which is always in the tanks independent of human drudgery.
The mill works while you sleep.
BillabonK Mill
THE GEARED MILL WITH THE RELIABLE SPEED GOVERNOR
The Billabong is a massively-built geared Mill with a patented
speed regulator and governor, which regulates the speed of pumping
to the velocity of the wind, and stops the Mill altogether when the danger
point is reached. Some other good points are: Centre lift, noiseless
action on its ball-bearing bedplate, automatic lubrication, and five bear-
ings only, all of the split type, any one of which is replaceable without
shifting any gear. The Billabong costs no more than an ordinary Mill
and banishes the expense of drudgery. A good investment which
soon pays for itself. Order now.
“On a property that 1 have leased , a Mill
was needed to draw water. We had a fair
task for it. as the direct height to which it
had to draw and force the water was 70ft.
It does this with ease in a slight breeze. It
does more than was expected, as it is v orkinn
a fi-inch Pump.” —Extract from letter received.

H.I 1 .h.: One of those distracting things
that get half-way in and there stick John D.:
Its lilt carried it far; but there really isn’t anything
fresh in it R.H.K.: Not quite N.A.E.: “Narra-
been” pretty, but very slight.. .R.D.F.: Spoilt by
its extravagance... .Pelotra: Never safe to touch such
cases till they’re finished. .. .N.S.P.: Another “dawn-
morn” rhymester! Listen t’us:—
The man who yokes “applause” in verse
" tth “doors,'’ or “dawn” with “morn,” •
A sore affliction has to nurse;
One, an he knew, might make him curse
The day that he was born.
M e clamber up, with many a toot
And many a trusty guide,
Parnassus’ slopes. But here’s a coot
W ho slips before he gets his foot
Upon the mountain side.
Oh, deaf to music’s notes are some,
And others color-blind.
But few of such desire to strum
Like Liszt, or Titians become.
And hence they needn’t mind.
Hut woe tor him who haunts the shrine
Where laurel wreaths are worn,
Who has the poet's fire divine
And yet will end with “dawn” a line
And close its mate with “morn”!
N.S.C.: No thrill in it....U. Kalliptus: Too
mechanical for an effective lie J.D.S.: Poor
B.S.B.; Too long and a little lumpy; and what did
the girl really do?...M.N.: Wretched... Eden : Both
fall heavily P.B.P.: No use Aboriginal: Poor
and thin as your mangiest dog L.J.C.: Afraid
you don’t really know your poet.... J.C.: Not up,
but a good try L.G.B.: Can’t find the promise.
. ...A.C.H.: The makings of a yarn, but it is not
made..., J.G.: Even the massacre of Glencoe is
hardly an excuse for such bad rhymes... .R.A.K.M.:
Crude and rugged.... Lance Jack: Sorry, can’t pro-
mote you to print N.J.S.: Not for us M.I.D.:
It hasn’t the strength to pull through S.U.S.:
Just a piling up of obvious commonplaces. .. .M.G.
(Oakey) : The mirth of it is missing... .James M.:
Not enough there... .M.N.L.: Gallipoli sketch covers
old ground ; the other is too inconsequential.. . .
B.C.T.: It should say more....C3: Not very excit-
ing.... D.E. (Orange): “Choom” can be improved.
. ...W.D.S.: The swans have melody. See what he
does in four or five years... .Cloudland: Horrible.
... .E.N.T.E.: Some good lines. Get to work on the
rest... .C.C.M.: No market for that sort of stuff....
Dale R.: Couldn’t be much worse.... Caesar: Doesn’t
say anything. . . .H.J.E.: A sloppy mess of words. . . .
Meta G.: Both are good, but at present not quite
good enough.... B.S. (Hobart): A fine example of
the direct method :—
She married the Chinaman.
He turned out a cur,
Illtreating her badly,
Horsewhipping her.
One day in the laundry,
He threw her some towels;
Refusing to wash them,
He stabbed her bowels.
Her father got sober,
Tired of the beer;
He killed the Chinaman,
At the court did appear.
The Judge with the jury
Could not agree;
He said to the revenger:
“My man, you are free.”
... .Brumby: Won’t do.... J.F.S.: Both jests are
feeble to the point of imbecility.... Corkscrew: A
fine sample of tortuous writing. .. .Dave B.: Thin as
a cat’s whiskers. .. .O.C.O.: Poor in thought and
manner.... B.E.B.: The sonnets are not well done.
....Overlander: Wonderful as is the mystery of its
possible meaning, the scheme of punctuation is more
wonderful still: —
An aoheing brow, and a broken heart,
Will, long, success, on Nero's’ loam,
Tears may blend, with a hero’s’ part,
And, save, from destruction, an island, Home.
. . . .C.L.C.: The thing says nothing. . . .Billbob:
Not a glimmer in it... .R.T.K.: “Desire” is poor...
M.T.IC : Too slight... .P.C.C.: Doesn’t strike us
in the right place.... Colin L.: Unless very well
done verses about the weather are not much more
cheerful than conversation about the baby’s health. . .
Ben: You only see the same thing as millions of other
people. .. .C.B. (Manly): The verse bucks and pig-
roots too violently and the yarn is very aged....
Delhi: The theme is old and the manner very
rugged. .. .Adrian F.: “Cloud” wants better con-
struction.... Ce-efpe: Doesn’t appeal to us. . .A.E.E.:
The verse moves like a horse with a broken back
trying to climb a precipice; but every now and
then you lighten the process with a well-known
phrase from Tom Hood. . . .P.L.M.: Doesn’t thrill
one whisker.... Arthur F.: It fluttered feebly to the
basket. .. .A.R.M.: Not up. . ..Catamain: If J. C.
Nesfield, M.A., says that, he shows himself to be a
Cockney person. The letter r does not require to
be rolled twice on the tongue, but it is pronounced
all the same. The man who says “fourth” is a true
rhyme for “cloth” mispronounces both the vowel and
consonant sounds in the words. .. .P.S.L.: Try to
give the bull yarn brighter handling.... F.F.F.:
You don’t seem to have anything to say on tl.e sub-
ject ... .E.M.E.: The rhymes and the lack of them
spoil “Viewpoint”... .Bellerive: The dog-catching
■sample is true to type:—
Weekly in our district wafts
A shrill and yelling sound;
There’s captures’ wails and exits
When the dog-car goes its round;

Firestones on before we started, instead of having to change

FIRESTONE TYRES
The name is a guarantee of Matchless Service
It spells a double saving few motorists can
afford to neglect, viz., greater mileage than has
ever been bought before, and at the lowest
price at which quality tyres can legitimately be
sold.
Firestone’s service in building tyres of linvin-
cible quality consistently over a period of two
decades, has written an indelible record in the
annals of auto-motive progress which could
only have been achieved by the most reliable
construction the industry has produced. In-
cluded is a staunch double Gum Dipped Cord
carcass which reduces friction to a minimum,
and a superior method of curing on air bags,
evenly distributing the strain under load.
The Firestone Gum-Dipped Cord is actually the
highest expression of Firestone genius and
represents a factor vitally important to the
motorist generally.

“Adelaide” : The Savings- Bank of South
Aus. is celebrating its 75th b.rthday. It
started in a little room in Gawlcr-place, with
one paid official, and hon. trustees assisting
him ; their job was to receive money on one
day a week and pay out on one other day.
After a time it shifted into King William-
street (the building is now occupied by the
Bagot Shakes Co.), but it had to build for
itself in Currie-street in 1904. The coming
of the Commonwealth Savings Bank seems
to have affected it very little: actually 72
out of every 100 people in the frugal com-
munity are depositors in the State Bank.

“Good Aussie”: The Civil Aviation De-

Vickers-Vulcan eight-passenger aeroplane
with 375-h.p. Rollr ’oyce engines. This
flying-machine is for me mail service .between
Charleville and Cloncurry (Q.), a distance
of 600 miles.' How about an aerml service
from Port Melbourne to Burnie (Tas.).only
about 207 miles? Vickers and Co. build fly-
ing boats which can do the trio in 2$ hours,
and return the same day. Such a quick
means of transit would be much more sen-
sib’e than Wullv Macpherson’s suggestion
that Victoria should swallow Tasmania.
Flying boats have been well chosen to be safe.

“Leg Stump”: Here’s another boost for
Australian hardwood. Talking to Bill Stew-
art (boss cocky at the Sydney Cricket
Ground) I remarked on the dirty color of the
stumps then standing in the centre of the
ground, and was in f or‘m'ed that they had been
in service for the last 14 years. Before that,
of course, the imported article had been used,
and sometimes broken, especially when Ernie
Jones and Jack Marsh were in action. Stew-
art suggested to the late Victor Trumper that
he ought to get wickets made of Australian
wood. Two sets were ordered, and duly
turned out. In 14 seasons only one stump
has been broken by a bowler, and that was
done by the late “Tihby” Cotter in almost
his last game.

“Cashier”: Banking amalgamations have
been carried out even more strenuously in
England than in Australia. There was wide
mistrust of the fusions while they were tak-
ing place, for the public believed that the
monsters would work more by rule of thumb
and that the personal quality of the client
—-what the insurance offices call the moral
factor —would count hardly at all. The mis-
trust has, however, almost entirely gone,
and generally it is found that the monsters
are prepared to do more for promising enter-
prises than their little predecessors were
able to do. But it will take years for the
staffs to settle down. Most of them are work-
ing under new sets of rules and regulations,
many of which they find irksome—often, it
seems, because they don’t know how far they
can be disregarded—and in one or two cases
there are complaints about “teaming”; that
is to say, the men of Brown’s Bank, which
has been amalgamated with Robinson’s Bank
and Jones’s Bank, work together for then-
own advancement, and can manage it pretty
well, too, if they get the run of head office.
To the men of Robinson’s and Jones’s banks
this wipes out the advantage which amalga-
mations offer in the shape of bigger plums to
str ; ve after. No doubt this little grievance
will cease to exist when the heads,and the
staffs get better acauainted : meantime it is
a matter that wants attention.
SAVING THE SITUATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Week by week we gardeners plod along, hoping
for the best; week by week we look around and
And that, instead of having forged ahead, we have
slipped backward. It is as well that we should face
the truth. We know better how to battle when we
admit the worst. Nothing that we can do will help
the situation any. All there is for it is to strive
hard to hold our own. Every day we pull through
makes our work lighter. The daj-s are shortening,
and the heat grows less.” —Sydney Telegraph.
\et another week-end’s passed, my lads,
And the foe still stands at bay,
So battle along for all you’re worth
In the good old British way.
It may be that we’ll meet defeat
(It appears as though we would),
We’ll, anyway, cause the world to say :
“Well, they failed as Britor.s should.”
Now Brown, old boy, what about those beans T
Will you leave ’em in the lurch?
Will you shirk the fray next Sabbath Day
And amble along to church?
You won’t! By jove, lam proud of you 1
Hop into the tool-house, lad,
Grab yonder hoe, and, for weal or woe,
Start hilling them up like mad.
You, Smith, are charged with the sacred job
Of saving your bed of peas.
I shall look to you to pull ’em through,
And my orders they are these:
“Dig in a load of your best manure
And scatter the bone-dust free.
And work by the book,, or don’t you look
For encouragement from me.”
May the suburbs’ watchword be, by day,
“All hands to the mulching pit!”
Should the Water Board's inspector call
Let him see you down to it.
And when night falls and the hour draws near
When inspectors lie abed,
Relieved of doubt, get your sprinklers out,
With the cry: “Full speed ahead!”

CITROEN
TGRTFUTYIYUO
PROOF POSITIVE!
PATERSON, LAING & BRUCE, LTD.,
Wynyard Street,
Sydney, 13th Feb., 1923.
Salmons Motors,
171 Castlereagh Street, Sydney.
Dear Sirs, —We have pleasure in informing you that
since we purchased the Citroen cars some twelve months
past we have experienced satisfaction: the general running
mechanically leaving nothing to be desired, and the fuel
consumption being economical to a degree.
I am, your faithfully,
(Signed) L. Matthew Donaldson, Director.
PATERSON, LAING & BRUCE, LTD.
The first two Citroens were installed by Paterson, Laing and Bruce in
October, .1921. Three more were added a month later, and two more within
four months. The result is a fleet of eight Citroens in regular daily service.
Ihe average running cost of these cars is 17/8| per week per car. This is
the figure supplied by the firm’s garage manager. It is as fine a record as
could be asked. The Citroen cars appear to be particularly suited to the work
upon which they are employed. Over a period of a year the highest working
expense/per car was £l/0/11 per week, and the lowest 16/21.
The'fiioney actually paid out on three of the Citroen cars over varying
distance's was as follows: (1) 5053 miles, £42/1/5: 1.99 d. per mile; (2) 3153
miles, £33/0/ 4s : 2.51 d. per mile; (3) 2885 miles, £l7/15/5: 1.49 d. per mile.
One Citroen car averaged 26 miles per gallon on a run entailing approxi-
mately 70 stops per day; a second reached 27 m.p.g. for 60 stops a day. Mr.
Fallick states that he secures 52 miles per gallon on the Citroen car he has
for his own use.
The cars are fitted with box boots capable of carrying about 6cwt. when
fully loaded. The travellers are not required to do anything mechanically to
the machine. Begularly every fortnight each car is kept in the garage for a
couple of hours to permit of a general tightening up, thorough oiling and
greasing, etc. The firnj applies the belief that a pound of grease saves many
pounds’ worth of repairs.
It is a significant fact that each important business which tests thp
economy of motor-cars for travellers’ use acquires in course of time a fleet
of cars, large or small, in accordance with the size of the business itself.
Messrs. Paterson, Lairig and Bruce’s fleet is amongst the largest. That it
has grown to its present proportions is evidence of the economical service
obtained.

Mennen’s ?
What I like about men in Aus-
tralia and NewZealandis that they
are not penny wise and pound
foolish. Mennen Shaving Cream
ccsts them 2d. more a month than
hard soap. I’ll admit it. At the
same time I’ll admit that Mennen’s
is well worth the difference. The
extra comfort, the extra confi-
dence, the extra cordiality that
ccrr.es with the 120 shaves in a
Mennen tube is worth as many
pounds as the pennies that might
be saved each month.
As one of my enthusiastic
friends says," I’m not arguing, I’m
only telling you.” The test is in
the tube. The tube is in every
good shop that stocks toilet pre-
parations. It’s your move.

Thomas Jelbart, of Ballarat, is a grandson
of that John Jelbart who was a co-worlcer
with John Wesley in the establishment of
Methodism. Thomas, following more or less
in grandad's footsteps, is a local preacher.
Of the 2.0 Rhodes scholars that Victoria
has furnished up to date, only two are on

Prof. Orme Masson (Chemistry).
Vie. Lands Department, which is employ-
ing as many returned soldiers as possible
on the administrative work attached to set-
tling other Diggers on the land, has appointed
Walter Peeler, V.C., inspector of settlements
in the Bairnsdale district, whose god is
Maize. Peeler won his Cross at Ypres.
“Pedro”: During the last N.S.W. State
election an obviously appointed heckler
asked McGirr, “Is it a fact that you are a
wealthy man?” “You bet it is,” replied
McGirr heartily. “You go back to the capi-
talists who sent you here and tell them that
I’m worth more money than any of them.”
“The Deacon” : Good old mother-in-law is
by no means dead, despite the efforts of the
alleged comic papers. Up here —it’s a
N.S.W. town —there are three perennially
straying horses which are the heartbreak of
the garden-keeping community. Repeated
complaints to the respons.ble officials regard-
ing their immunity wrung from him the
admission that they were the property of his
mother-in-law, and that he simply dare not
pound them !
“Pantagruel”: Queensland is the first
State whose Education Department has
adopted the moving picture as a means of
instructing its outback children. The Gov-
ernment has bought a machine which will
project pictures 6ft. square. Still pictures of
objects from books and postcards can be re-
produced without detriment to the originals.
The itinerant teacher will carry the machine
in his car or motor-cycle, which will also
provide the power to work it. Winton (W.Q.)
lias been selected as his first pitch.
“J.F.H.” (London) : A number of younsr
fellows who tramped about Australia with
their blueys afterwards attained distinction.
Governor Sir Ralph Williams, for example;
also Henry Kingsley, novelist, war corres-
pondent and London editor. Walter Howard,
actor and playwright, who recently passed
out in London, was a third, and there are
others who have left reminiscences of early
tramping in Australia. Walter Howard’s
will, by the way, was admitted to probate
the other day. He left £5Oll. Some of his
melodramas, though of no great literary
merit, were good money-spinners, notably
“Seven Days’ Leave,” “The Under Dog” and
“The Story of the Rosary.”
“Schnorrer”: My friend Alan McPherson
McDougall (originally Ephraim Levi) ques-
tions my statement (B. 8/3/’23) regarding
Disraeli, assuring me that the Jewish states-
man died an R.C. John Oliver Hobbes
(Mrs. Craigie) introduces Disraeli in one of
her novels, and takes the opportunity of
declaring in a note that on his deathbed he
joined the R. C. Church. But this story was
blown out long ago. All that is relevant on
this subject is that shortly before the Earl
of Beaconsfield’s death he expressed a desire
to see a certain priest, but the latter, being
out, never got the message. It may be —
though it doesn’t follow- —that he desired
to die in the R.C. faith ; but Mrs. Craigie’s
assertion that he did so has been proved
foundationless.
Boyd Cable on ships’ talk :—•
Ships at sea have many sorts of tongues with
which they hold converse with each other, or with
the shore. Some have wireless and all have flags,
semaphore and Morse lamps, and mercantile marine
officers have to pass tests in signalling with these
before they get their “tickets.” And all have
another sort of language in which they must talk
at certain times and under certain conditions. Every
steamer must be provided with an efficient steam
wn.stle or siren, a mechanicalty-ojpefated foghorn,
and a bell, a drum being permitted as rather a
quaint, substitute for the bell on Turkish vessels. , A
sailing-ship must carry a mechanical foghorn and
a bell. These laws of the sea apply to all ships of
all nations, and although it is true that there are
Arab dhows and Malay prauws and odd Chinese junks
on which it might be difficult to find a foghorn
operated by anything more mechanical than a man’s
lungs, the vessel unprovided with the regulation
outfit would find difficulty in getting out of any
civilised port.
In fog, snowstorms, heavy rain or any other
sort of “thick” weather, all sorts and sizes
of ships, from the Olympic to an oyster-dredger, must
proceed to talk their loudest and tell any other
ship what they are and what they are doing. A
ship may be groping carefully along in such weather
and, seeing nothing, will suddenly hear a prolonged
siren blast followed two minutes later by another:
she knows then that there is another steamer near
and that she is moving forward or “has way upon
her.” If the one blast changes to two with a
second’s interval between, it means that the steamer
has stopped her engines and is not moving, although
she is not at anchor. If this remark ceased to be
repeated and instead a bell sounded a five-seconds’
jangle every one minute, everyone in the vicinity
would know that a ship was at anchor. If you
should hear one, two or three blasts sounding every
one minute instead of every two, you would know
that it was a sailing-ship telling you whether she
was sailing with the wind on her port or starboard
side or “abaft her beam” (more astern than side-
ways). The reason for the sailing-ship being obliged
to tell the side of her on which the wind is blowing
is that other vessels may better steer clear of her.
If the sailing-ship, for instance, has the wind on her
right side she can c:,iy turn a very limited distance
to the right before she would be running in the face
of the wind and brought to a stop, whereas she
could turn away to the left and continue sailing,
the wind then merely being more over her stern.
There are other messages which can be shouted
by the sirens and horns. A vessel which, for any
reason, is not under command and cannot get out
of the way, says so by giving one prolonged blast
followed by two short, repeating this at not less than
tw..-minute intervals. Trawlers and fishing-vessels
with lines or nets down have other remarks to make.
It is not only in fog or thick weather that the ships
usefully shout at each other. By one, two or three
short blasts a steamer says she is turning to star-
board or to port, or has her engines going full-speed
astern. Even when fully visible to each other such
information is useful, because a lar?e steamer takes
a number of seconds to answer her helm, and if
she shifts helm to alter course it is well to say so
promptly to any other vessel which may be near.

(from

“I have been a master hairdresser in Sydney for
tho past 35 years, and during that time have tried
many shaving soaps, with a view of discovering one
suitable for use in my saloon, and after giving the
Jue.iona triangular Shaving Stick a trial, great was
my surprise to find I had at last secured a suitable
soap, one which has given entire
satisfaction. It lathers excel-
lently and softens the beard
bette»* than other soaps I have
used, and at the same time it
leaves the face free from all
irritation.
“I have always been a great
advocate for Rexona Tri-
angular Shaving Stick, as
I realise that it has no
equal, both for preserving
the skin and its economi-
cal. value.
“I will recommend
Rexona Shaving Soap to
my friends and customers,
well knowing that they
will be rewarded after a
trial.”

market, but care should be exercised not to «Up the Stick in the water, but wet
the face anti apply the Shaving Soap tlry. A tew applications with the shaving brush
will quickly produce a thick, creamy lather, which lasts and thoroughly softens the
beard, leaving the skin in a healthy and hygienic condition after the shave.
Everyone should use a Medicated Soap for shaving, for,
after going over the face with the razor and removing the
beard, the skin needs a protection from the germs carried
by the dust which everyone has to face.

The Chant at Night
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN no star is at its post,
Shining white and shining clear,
As you walk tne midnight coast
If you listen you can hear,
Closing ears to swish of spray,
Sigh of wind and stir or leaf.
What the restless billows say
As they break on beach and reef.
“From the dawn of time,” they chant —
“Ere the forests had their birth—
We were set to roll and roll
Round the coasts of all the earth;
We were set to roll and roll,
Under sun and star and moon —
Swaying, swinging through the night,
Swinging, swaying through the noon.
“Ere the days of men began—
Men the restless, men the brave,
Ere the first astounded man
From the threshold of his cave—
Looking downward, saw us rolling
On and on, like molten gold—
We were rovers, we were roamers,
We were rangers, tired and old.
“Ages gone ere yet a keel
On our crests was tossed and hurled,
By the Primal Thrust sent forth,
We were made to range the world ;
We are slaves to mighty motion,
And our task is never done,
Like the rushing, racing planets
Round the ever-circling sun.
“We are tired of storm and calm,
Winds that sigh and winds that sing;
Maybe, rest will come at length,
But we know not anything.
Comes a time when mortals vanish,
When they think their travail past,
When the grave is filled above them,
Are they sure of rest at last?”
When no star is at its post,
Shining clear and shining white,
As you move along the coast
With the restless things of night—
Crag and cliff to right and left
And a lighthouse set afar—
Thus you’ll hear the billows chant
As they break on beach and bar.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
Mandoline.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BULL GURNEY was the holder of
Grazing Farm No. 555 K, an area
of 50,000 acres bordering on the
lonely track that led down north to the
Gulf of Carpentaria. An unconventional
man, Bull, holding lightly the perils and
hazards of that wild region ; obeying a code
of his own framing, since set laws and puris-
fictions do not run there very appreciably.
Also a fighting man, ready to go bellowing
and defiant into the arena, if baited enough
and withal a simple-minded man, who saw
little of white women, since the nearest lived
over 40 miles away—strange creatures, given
to coquetries, evasions and subtleties that
left him bewildered. According to the few
books he read, contact with women invari-
ably led. to love, romancq and matrimony,
and, while he esteemed love as very desir-
able, he was as shy of matrimonial' ties as
a cleanskin bull is of the branding-yard. So,
year after year, he went his way, troubling
little about women—till he met Mandoline.
It happened one morning early in the
autumn. Riding on his rounds he saw kite-
hawks hovering over some timber in the dis-
tance. in a fashion that indicated to him
the presence of strangers; for the spacing
of tracks and the flight of birds were his
daily newspapers. wSo he rode on to investi-
gate. and found a newly-pitched camp with
numerous tents.
To his astonishment the only person pre-
sent was a girl, and a. very attractive girl
at that, of a type unknown to him, with
blazing black eyes, piquant mouth and lithe,
free-moving figure. Italian or French, he
guessed she was. He removed his hat from
his curly head, feeling oddly nervous at this
apparition, and inquired for the boss.
“They are all out, cutting the sandalwood.
You will stay and wait for them, and drink
some tea. yes?”
Rather shyly, Gurney dismounted, wish-
ing that his shirt was less soiled, and drank
tea, as custom demanded; listening, as the
girl spoke in a strange, high key, as if ever
verging on laughter—an intonation new to
him, but none the less pleasing. She was
the daughter of the boss, who had brought
there a gang of men to cut sandalwood.
Away in distant China the oil of the sandal-
wood had boomed, and it now paid to come
from the shores of the Gulf, over 100 miles
away, to get the wood.
“Father says there is not much of the
wood here, and he will soon cut it and return
♦ o the Gulf. Do you also cut sandalwood?”
Gurney laughed, and. seeing the girl was
puzzled, quickly explained.
“Then you must be a squattair?”
“Not yet.” replied Gurney; “some day,
perhaps. But you, miss, you must find it
‘onely out here by yourself?”
“No., no,” she exclaimed. “I was born
in Italia, and I love the heat, and the great
plain, as it is here, like ours, and the big
river. I hear the birds talking in the trees
all the day. How can I be lonely?”
And as she spoke, with eyes aglow, the
old desire for a mate returned to disturb
Gurney. Such a woman as this would suit
him, and it had never been his luck to asso-
ciate with such a one, unattached.
“I’m not lonely either.” he observed. “It’s
a great country this. Our winter is coming
—grand, cool days, with never a cloud for
six months; no frost, and the cattle get fat.
In November the storms come, and about
Christmas the wet season. Sometimes it
rains weeks then, and it is hot. and plonty
insects. But we don’t mind them. Never
work in the heat. Sometimes I am shut off
for two months by the floods, and see no
strangers at all.”
It was now the girl’s turn to laugh to
herself.. For, with the instinct of her sex,
she divined tins man’s thoughts—knew she
had attracted him, and that he was thinking
of her already in (hat homo of his. Her
laugh made him think of the crackling of a
fire. Just then the sandalwood gang re-
turned to camp—a villainous-looking crew,
such as ever the sea spews out on silent
strands, there to search for easy spoil: Rus-
sians, Greeks and men from the city sfums,
slovenly and unkempt, with not one of the
decent bush type among them. The ganger
was an Italian who had learnt his English
in America.
Gurney soon left the camp and struck
across to his own country. There was some-
thing unusual in his mind. He rode in a
zigzag fashion searching for tracks, and s._on
found that what he suspected was true—
these men were killing his cattle for beef.
He was not greatly upset; he had dealt with
the same situation often before. Seeking
out the ganger again, he took him aside.
“Look, your crowd are killing my bullocks
for meat. I won't stand any more of that.
If you want beef I’ll sell it to you cheap.”
The ganger appeared quite unperturbed.
"We don’t aim at killin’ your cattle speci-
ally,” he observed. “But I reckon by the
custom of this country we’re entitled to free
meat, and we’re go n’ to take it. That’s
flat. The same time, if you tell us your
brand, and there’s other cattle just as handy,
why, we’ll take them instead.”
“Well,” replied Gurney reflectively, “my
brand is BG7. There’s plenty others run-
ning round. If you take them, it ain’t my
business. But if you kill any more o’ mine,
you’ll get shot doin’ it.”
“Say,” grinned the other, “if you start
fight, we’ll fix you, don’t worry ! But what
I said stands. That’s square, ain’t it?”
Gurney assented. The Gulf country has
its own conscience on the subject of property
in cattle, and Gurney himself did not agree
with the written laws on the point. If an-
other man stole his cleanskin calves he would
square himself by appropriating from the
other man more than he had taken. He
had been driven into this because the law
was cumbersome to invoke, and, when in-
voked, quite futile, as a conviction for cattle-
stealing was never procurable. And Gurney
was quite capable of asserting his own
rights, as various cattle-thieves had learned;
he was now left alone with the reputation
of being dangerous.
But he was puzzled as to how he should
deal with these adventurers, who, like the
fierce midsummer storms that crashed up
from the mysterious Gulf country, had
come, brawling and pillaging, on their way
from the coast. If they continued to rob
him, how could he retaliate? To keep a
watch on them, he decided to camp near
them. The girl had some influence in his
taking this step, also; and she provided an-
other very serious complication.
Though he pitched his camp just across the
waterhole, he associated not at all with the
sandalwood-getters. He had very little in
common with them. But as to the girl, that
was different. No barrier of race or senti-
ment could cheek the attraction each had
for the other. In him she saw a blonde
giant, resolute and purposeful. In her he
saw the eternal feminine; the grace and fire
of youth and the laughter of her voice
haunted him. In the daytime, as she went
about hfr tasks, she would somet-mes hall
him across the water; and in their inter-
course he lost his shyness and learnt to
address her as Mandoline.
“Do you know, Bool,” she confided, “that
sometimes I am very troubled? My father
he is cruel to me, and says I must marry
George, the Greek overseer, so that he will
get much money from George. And I hate
George; I will die before I marry him!”
“Quite right/’ agreed Gurney fervently.
“That George looks a reg’lar cut-throat.
And, look here, if they bother you, I’m your
friend, you know that, Mandoline.”
Gurney wished to express himself much
more definitely, but could not find the words.
“Ah. you will help me, if I am in trouble?”
“Help you? Why,” he exclaimed, sud-
denly articulate,* “if there’s any marryin’
to be done I’m the man who’s going to do
it. I” . \
But at this juncture George the Greek
put in an appearance. From the outset he
had been suspicious of Gurney, and nmde
visits to the camp to spy on the girl. Now
he had found them together.
“What you do loafing roun’ our camp
while we work? Get out, an queeck!”
Gurney regarded the Greek for a space,
silent and impassive.
“I’ll get out when I’m.ready, not before.”
“Very well, then. I make you.”
Seizing an axe, he rushed towards Gur-
ney, but soon halted, for the latter had pro-
duced an ugly-looking automatic, and stood
his around, square-jawed and ominous.
“If you want fight, put away the axe, and
I’ll go you.”
But George was not prepared to fight
then, and after a tirade of abuse he hurried
off, threatening to bring back the ganger.
Mandoline smiled at Gurney and murmured,
“What you were saying when he come?”
Gurney, who was better at doing than
saying, seized her in his arms, and they then
agreed that he would carry her off to the
nearest minister without delay.
“But you must leave here "now, 8001, or
they will kill you. I will think of some plan
to escape them.”
So Gurney rode away into the forest to
flunk over his problem, past great water-
holes whete crocodiles basked sleepily,
through pea-bush plains where wild-melon
vines clustered, by spreading lagoons aglint
with the warm winter sun. Playful steers
cantered insolently towards him. as if dar-
ing his approach : myriads of eorellas circled
over his head; wild horses galloped away in
the distance. But of all these things he took
little heed. Suddenly there had been thrust
upon him the do ; ng of unthought-of. momen-
tous things—the taking and wedding of bis
life-mate. He must take her w ; thout blood-
shed, if possible, and be married w ; th all
due solemnities. Though unconventional in
many ways, matrimony was to him a sacred
rite. There was the Bush Brother, a fine
fellow, who could marry them. 150 miles
away: or Father Cass’dy, who might be
close handy on h T s annual tour. Then there
were clothes: a mao must have a black suit
to be married in. These affairs worried him
more than the conflict he must assuredly
have with the gang.
When he returned to his camp that night,
he found that a teamster had come to the
Italian from Normanton. to take awav a
load of sandalwood. To judee by the noise
he had brought a cargo of liquor with him.

An orgy ensued; not the harmless drunk
known to Gurney, when hilarious men per-
formed horseback feats, and fought with
lists ; but a riot, wherein crazy men shrieked
like demons and fought with knives. Fear-
ing that the girl might come to some harm,
Gurney forded the river, and hid in under-
growth close to the camp. He was not there
long before Mandoline approached.
‘‘l have been watching you Bool,” she
said softly. ‘‘l am glad you came, for I am
afraid. Yet it is no use for me to go while
the camp is here, for they will follow and
kill you.”
And then she was gone. But Bull Gurney
remained to keep watch over her, and was
very angry. At length, however, the uproar
died away, and there was no call for his in-
tervention.
As he rode out the next morning he again
found tell-tale tracks. But there was no
pretence at concealment this time; three of
his cattle were lying dead, shot down appa-
rently in an open challenge to him.
He mounted his horse and cantered away
westward, and that afternoon arrived at an
out-station of Flaming Downs, a huge
property with a herd of 30,000 cattle.
Clark, the manager, was there with his brand-
ing camp, a man whom Gurney himself was
a little afraid of; a super-bushman, small,
wiry, angular and fearless, who could shoot,
ride and handle cattle better than any other
man in the Gulf country. Gurney told him
his story, and his plans.
"These coves have been killing your cattle
hand over fist,” said Gurney. "You know I’m
no detective, and what they do to you isn’t
my business. But now they’re shooting-
mine. If you and your men come along
with me, we can drive them out of the dis-
trict.”
_ Clark pondered for a while, and then gave
his decision.
“I’ll go with you, Gurney. We’ll show
these hoodlums that they can’t come bully-
ing cattlemen.”
The sandalwood gang were late risers,
and not even the cook was astir when next
morning the clatter of horses, and clinking
of hobble-chains disturbed the camp at sun-
rise. The ganger, emerging from his tent,
saw, to his amazement, the whole of his
horses gathered in front of him; behind
them half-a-score of horsemen, wearing, wide
felts, khaki shirts and spotless moles. Clark
rode forward and accosted the Italian.
“I’m the manager of Flaming Downsj I’ve
come here because you have been lulling
my cattle, and in some cases merely taking
steak pieces, and leaving the rest to rot.
That is a damnable practice. What do you
mean, by it?”
He paused to let this sink in, fixing the
ganger with a steely eye. The latter, though
feeling some uneasiness, resorted to his
usual tactics.
“What? Another bunch of hayseeds! See
here, stranger; it’s a custom in this coun-
try to have free meat. Juries never convict
for that. If you don’t like it, go get your
police!”
“No,” replied Clark, chattily. “We’re too
busy to bother the police. It is also our
custom to deal out our own law to scoundrels,
and leave them to ‘go get’ the police. I
now give you notice to strike camp, and
leave this district at once. We have brought
your horses to save you time. If you are
not gone by 10 o’clock, all simr. sandalwood
stacks will be burnt.”
The ganger made no reply, but hurried
into his tent, to return a moment later, look-
ing bewildered.
“Mr. Gurney,” resumed Clark, “took your
guns this morning while you were asleep.
Besides, we have weapons and are quite
skilled with them ; for instance”
Clark smilingly shot holes through a jam-
tin 20 yards beyond the ganger.
“And if you insist on fist-fighting, why”——
But just here George the Greek, who had
arrived on the scene with his mates,
addressed Gurney in such a manner that the
latter flung off his horse and closed with his
rival. It was an interesting tight while
it lasted, fought under prehistoric rules. No
portion of the body was out of bounds for
hitting, kicking or gouging. It was con-
ducted on the ground, or half-kneeling, or
on foot, as conditions permitted. Once
they fell foul of the fire, and rolled in the
ashes; at another time they fought on top
of a chained dog,' which bit both of them
impartially. Meanwhile the gang looked on,
neutral now because of the silent row of
horsemen behind them.
And Mandoline? It had been Gurney’s
intention when the gang had been put on the
move to take her away to Cloncurry. She
now watched the fight in great excitement,
if one might judge by her expression and
gestures. George was obviously failing under
the weight'of Gurney’s attacks ; treacherous
fighting availed him nothing against that
strength. But the contest ended abruptly
and unexpectedly. Mandoline, bursting
through the onlookers, threw a pint of hot
water upon Gurney ! He, in pained surprise,
let up from a master grip, and saw her
confronting him, flourishing a butcher’s-
knife.
“I keel you if you touch George again!”
That she said, with more to the same
effect, her laughing intonation now higher
and more strange than ever. Gurney
retreated before her in amazement, one eye
staring at her, the other half-closed and
blackened. As George slunk away to tend
his hurts, Clark pressed on with his busi-
ness. Turning to the unkempt gang that
lounged near him f he gave them brief orders.
“Now, boys, whoever attends to the
horses, get to work. Cook, get your gear
together. The rest of you, pack up and get
ready for the road. You, ganger, get out of
this, and keep going.”
There is an instinct in the primitive type
of man that senses the master, and there
was something about Clark that commanded
obedience. So the gang, after a short con-
sultation, in which they agreed they were
very glad to get away from such an accursed
hole, and with an eye on .their leader, who
gave no sign to the contrary, began on the
work appointed them. The ganger had only
intended staying there another week, and was
in no mood to try conclusions with Clark,
who had authority, numbers and money
behind him, as well as that spiritual quality
that betokened he, would do what he
threatened, burn the sandalwood.
So within a few hours their carts trailed
away northwards, with one of Gurney’s
blacKboys following, to see that they “kept
going.” Gurney, instead of seeming glad
at their departure, remained very silent and
depressed, so that Clark questioned him,
thinking he had sustained some hurt.
“No, I’m right. 8ut....d0 you think that
girl meant what she did to me? You know,
she told me they were cruel to her, and she
promised to come away with me. I can’t
make it out. She’s the only woman I
ever saw that I wanted.”
Clark scanned the bushman’s face closely,
and saw that he was hard hit.
“I’m no authority on women,” he observed.
"They’re queer cattle. My advice to you
is just forget all about her.”
“Forget?”
The following week Gurney spent, like
a wounded animal, far out in the forest,
in country so wild that no man laid claim
to it. There cattle ran in small mobs led
by old cleanskin bulls, as shy and as cun-
ning as d.ngoes. They fled at the scent
of him, and he saw only their tracks. He
convinced himself that he was searching for
stray caitle, but in reality he was trying
to regain some lost part of himself. The
week passed, and, restless still, he returned
to his homestead, assigned duties to his
“boys” and rode away south,
“Boss, he got hurt longa fight; now he
go longa doctor,”
That was the boy’s opinion. They feared
and loved Gurney, as dogs do their master,
and marvelled at his depression and because
he did not eat. But it was Dick the Dog’s
shanty that lie steered for, seventy miles
away, and there sought surcease in rum,
which is credited with assuaging grief. The
liquor only made him quarrelsome, so that
he fought most new arrivals till they cried
for quarter. But his spree was checked by
the arrival of a man badly hurt. Gurney
volunteered to drive him to Cloncurry, a
long journey farther south.
Two days at the railway township were
enough for Gurney. The noises kept him
awake till late, and he had to wait from
five till eight for his breakfast. Then there
was the conflict of strange smells and sounds
ever . assailing. his senses, and the alleged
human beings who brushed past him and
ignored his existence. When lie-did sleep
in his stuffy room, he would dream of a
lithe, black-eyed girl, calling to him across
the water, in tones that , ever seemed verging
on laughter.
So he rode down north again, still brood-
ing, like a bull that has been expelled from
the herd. It was a full four days’ journey,
and, as he rode, the warm winter sunshine
streamed down from a sky ever cloudless.
He had not vone far when ha came up
with Father Cassidy, also travelling north,
so they pursued their journey together.
To the Carpentarian there is something
fascinating in this journey, down north to
the gulf, through the great Flinders grass-
plains, that unroll where the rivets con-
verge as they turn towards the sea. With
the _ sun rising on his right shoulder and
setting on the left, the fertile plains, inter-
spersed with many a timber belt, unroll
themselves perpetually. Beaten roads merge
into bridle tracks, till at length a majestic
wilderness enfolds him, spaced with brim-
ming lagoons and seas of waving grasses,
and the north wind brings vague scents or
faraway salt water.
So the two travelled on, driving their
packhorses before them, chiefly in a silence
that betokened friendliness. Gurney ■ had
decided to travel on right down to the Gult,
for a yearning beset him, in spite of his
repulse, to seek out this girl, to seize her
and carry her off, whatever the consequences.
On tfie evening of the fourth day they
arrived at his homestead. Father Cassidy
rode on to the river to water liis horses.
The boys were absent, and Gurney walked
into his kitchen, surrounded by dogs bark-
ing their greetings, He was surprised to
note its clean and orderly condition.
“Must be some visitor here,” he observed,
For it is customary in that region for
travellers to enter and use one’s home 'with-
out invitation, Walking up the stairs he
was astonished to see it bore an unusually
comfortable appearance. The wig'll line, too,
was fluttering with his clothes. He paused,
bewildered, looking out a window to where
the sunset blazed half-way up the sky* ahd
listened, to hear only the call of the birds
as they flew, seeking night shelter. Then
there came another voice, as if one were
laughing, in the shadows.
“It ees I, 8001. That day I pretehd
anger, so fhey shall not think I am comihg
to you. I have waited so long; blit to-
morrow ydu will take me to our wedding !”
